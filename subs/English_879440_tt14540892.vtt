3
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.080
<i>This is me. Leone.</i>

4
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.920
<i>And this is my father Simone.</i>

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.640
<i>Simone's an anthropologist in theory,</i>

6
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.240
<i>but he gave up university</i>
<i>to run a restaurant downtown,</i>


7
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.280
<i>where the food is really good.</i>

8
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.560
<i>He's funny, athletic, self-confident,</i>
<i>and he's taught me so many things.</i>


9
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.360
I'll make you eat that thing, okay?

10
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.880
<i>And this is Paolo, my other dad.</i>

11
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.760
<i>Paolo's an architect with big ambitions,</i>

12
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.800
<i>but he's put them
aside for now as well</i>

13
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.560
<i>to dedicate himself to his furniture shop.</i>

14
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.640
<i>But he always encourages me</i>
<i>to be who I am.</i>


15
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.400
<i>But let's rewind to before I existed.</i>

16
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.720
<i>Paolo and Simone were a couple in love.</i>

17
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.320
<i>They'd been together five years,</i>

18
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.480
<i>and they felt ready to start a family.</i>

19
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.480
<i>But unfortunately in Italy, a couple</i>
<i>like them isn't allowed to adopt.</i>


20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800
<i>Everything changed when they met her.</i>

21
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.640
<i>This is Tilly.</i>

22
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.400
<i>Simone met her</i>
<i>at the University of California.</i>


23
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.400
<i>When he and Paolo spoke</i>
<i>to her about their great desire…</i>


24
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.560
SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520
<i>…she immediately offered to help them.</i>

26
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.200
<i>And thanks to Tilly,</i>
<i>I was born, to everyone's joy.</i>


27
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.800
<i>My childhood</i>
<i>was like that of lots of other kids,</i>


28
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.360
<i>and I never really saw my family</i>
<i>as any different.</i>


29
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.120
<i>While I was growing up,</i>
<i>society was divided,</i>


30
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.640
<i>and people took to the streets,</i>

31
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.240
<i>some in favor of the traditional family,</i>

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.400
<i>others to include</i>
<i>all sorts of families, like ours.</i>


33
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.040
<i>I was 11 when at last, my parents</i>
<i>were able to celebrate a civil union.</i>


34
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.440
<i>They were officially a couple,</i>
<i>even under the law.</i>


35
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.920
With this ring,
I take you to be my husband.


36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I declare you husband and husband.

37
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.280
<i>Civil unions were a great victory, sure,</i>

38
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.760
<i>but two people of the same sex</i>
<i>couldn't be on a birth certificate.</i>


39
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.480
The report can only be given
to one of the boy's parents.


40
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.200
But I am one of his parents!
I don't know what else…


41
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.640
<i>So, on my Italian birth certificate,</i>
<i>you can only have one parent…</i>


42
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.880
Dad, I told you
to bring the authorization…


43
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.800
<i>And Paolo was still
the only one on mine.</i>

44
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.400
<i>But a few months ago,</i>
<i>we got some good news.</i>


45
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.160
Here they are!

46
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.160
Can you explain to me why
today's such an important day for us?


47
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.640
Leone, at least wait till we get dressed.

48
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.800
Come on, Dad, a
couple of words. Come on.

49
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.040
As absurd as it seems,
since I've been your father for 15 years,


50
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.120
as of today, I'm finally going to have
my name on your birth certificate.


51
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.800
<i>Today the mayor of Fiumicino,</i>
<i>with a degree of courage,</i>


52
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.360
<i>has agreed to transcribe</i>
<i>the American birth certificate</i>


53
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.360
<i>that lists both Paolo</i>
<i>and Simone as my parents.</i>


54
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.760
<i>So everything's fine, then?</i>

55
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.440
<i>Actually, no,</i>

56
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.680
<i>because my parents told me</i>
<i>that this certificate could be… annulled.</i>


57
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.240
What do you think?

58
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.800
It's good, isn't it?

59
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.000
Yeah, it's good,
but it seems a bit short. No?


60
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.240
Mirante and Fabbri's is an hour.

61
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.880
It's boring, though, all about
the social structure of ants.


62
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.000
We've got the family,
social struggles, real life.


63
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.040
Yeah, I know, it's…
I dunno. There's something missing.


64
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.720
What's missing is a good twist.

65
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.320
Such as?

66
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.760
Such as revealing who your real father is.

67
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.680
You still going on about that?
They both are.


68
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.960
How can you not know
who your biological father is?


69
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.920
You must have
asked yourself a million times.


70
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.760
Who's she?

71
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.360
The French girl?

72
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.680
Get in line.

73
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.480
She's just got here, and she'll want
to be moving in the right circles.


74
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.880
She's not gonna be interested in us.

75
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Told you so.

76
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.720
What the fuck's so funny?

77
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.560
Remember, your videos will be shown
at the end of the year.


78
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.720
The whole school and your families
will be there.


79
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.040
Leone, how's your video
on LGBT rights in Europe?


80
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.680
Fine, yeah,

81
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.680
fine.

82
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.440
We're telling it
through the story of my own family.


83
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.360
My only doubt is whether
it might be a little too personal.


84
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.160
Your generation

85
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.000
uploads every moment onto social networks.

86
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.280
I think you know well the extent
to which the private is public.


87
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.680
And starting from personal experience
is the right way


88
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.840
to deal with any topic.

89
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.480
Immigration, the environment,

90
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.520
civil rights, solidarity…

91
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.280
All very interesting topics.

92
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.720
A good demonstration of awareness.

93
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.120
Work hard now, all of you!

94
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.280
Work with your hearts. I mean it, okay?

95
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.160
Goodbye.

96
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.280
Well done. That's the way. Down!

97
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.680
I know you've just discovered
masturbation, but don't overdo it!


98
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.760
I brought you the stuff.

99
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.560
Well done, Leone. 
Go, that's good.

100
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.600
Go, Michela.

101
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.200
Goodness.

102
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.560
What the fuck's so funny?

103
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.760
The girls, they'll save us…

104
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.080
You can see you're not into jerking off.

105
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.240
Jerking off, yeah… but I didn't
smoke a doobie before class.


106
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.360
You have to test
the quality of your product.


107
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.720
Sure.

108
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.200
Have you seen the new guy climbing?
He's good.


109
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.240
Well done.

110
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.320
And he's in with Frenchie.

111
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.040
Cool, tall, strong,
with the most beautiful girl in school,


112
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.200
and I bet he gets good grades
without fucking studying.


113
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.240
I'm having a party at my house tonight.

114
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.440
Okay.

115
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.360
-So what?
-I'm inviting you, loser.


116
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.280
Ten o'clock. A lot of people are coming.

117
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.800
We need some blow.

118
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.560
Sure, as much as you want.

119
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.360
Okay.

120
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.600
I'm not going to that party.

121
00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.920
-No, Leone…
-I'm not going.


122
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.160
-Do me this favor.
-I'm not going.


123
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.760
Come on, damn. What'll it cost you?
Why don't you want to go?


124
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.080
We'll have a couple of doobies
and a drink.


125
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.280
Okay, all right,
only because you're begging.


126
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.920
You're a true friend!

127
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.240
-Stop it!
-Thank you.


128
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.320
Jacopo!

129
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.200
I haven't forgotten about you!

130
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.000
Excuse me, sir. 
I have a stomach ache.

131
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.680
I have to go to the bathroom.

132
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.840
Leone!

133
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.000
Leone!

134
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.800
Leone, dinner's ready!

135
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.600
Coming!

136
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.200
Listen, Leone, this thing
you're making with Jacopo,


137
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.600
for school…

138
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.280
Do you really have to broadcast
our business to the whole world?


139
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.640
Aren't you proud?

140
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.760
We've raised an activist.

141
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.640
Yeah, or an opportunist

142
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.560
who exploits his parents' struggles
for a good grade at school.


143
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.440
It seems to me
it's still a good cause.

144
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.080
Okay, yeah,

145
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.640
but I will never authorize
the use of images


146
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.080
where I don't look splendid and young.

147
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.240
There won't be any images of you
in the video, then, unfortunately.


148
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.240
I might be able to use two or three
if I touch them up.


149
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.360
Enough!

150
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.240
It's Tilly, guys!

151
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.400
-Hello, Tilly!
-Hey!


152
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.480
Our fault. It was our turn to come.

153
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.320
-Twenty years together!
-Yeah!


154
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.280
Twenty years!

155
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.960
Cool, no?

156
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.040
Thank you.

157
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.200
Come on, Leone, we just got here.
Please, let's enjoy the evening.


158
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.760
What the fuck are they doing?

159
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.520
Dario! Will you stop being a jerk?

160
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.720
Are these people insane?

161
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.840
I'm going for a smoke. 
See you later.

162
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.200
Is this one just for you?

163
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.680
What?

164
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.400
You're such an idiot.

165
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.720
Leave me alone.

166
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.080
He likes fighting people.
It's like a hobby.


167
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.840
Shut up, Anna.

168
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.000
What are you drinking?

169
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.840
-Will you keep me company?
-Me? Sure.


170
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.800
I hate parties.

171
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.720
They're always full of idiots.

172
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.560
Which is why Dario likes them.
He's always got someone to fight with.


173
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.880
Yeah, in effect, your boyfriend
is a bit viol… decisive.


174
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.560
My boyfriend? You mean Dario?

175
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.200
-Yeah.
-He's not my boyfriend.


176
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.160
No?

177
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.240
It's just you seemed so…

178
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.760
-So he's…
-My twin brother.


179
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.720
Twin brother.

180
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.560
I'd say your brother's
settled in pretty quickly.


181
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.680
With those morons?

182
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.680
No.

183
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.120
He tries to play the alpha male,
but he's not like them.


184
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.840
We're nothing like each other.

185
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.400
Like, I love being here in Italy,
but he misses that dump of Lille.


186
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.120
-You lived in Lille?
-Yeah.


187
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.640
A nice city, Lille.

188
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.480
-No, it's a dump.
-Yeah.


189
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.440
It's cold and always raining.

190
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.280
Yeah, Rome's warmer.

191
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.600
Yes, it's warmer,
but then there's winter here…


192
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.080
It's definitely warmer, yeah.

193
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.480
Exactly.

194
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.200
And then it's huge. In Lille,
after a while, you've met everyone.


195
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.720
Well, it's not like we're
in New York here.


196
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.560
No, but at least there are
lots of different people and…


197
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.360
For example, I've never met anyone
with two fathers.


198
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.760
I saw you were preparing
that video for school.


199
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.840
I like this song. Let's go.

200
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.240
-Come on.
-No, I'll watch you.


201
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.840
DAD SIMONE,
COME AND GET US AS LATE AS POSSIBLE!


202
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.960
NOT FOR AT LEAST 2 HOURS! OKAY?

203
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.400
Did you like the wine?

204
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.840
I suggested it

205
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.520
because I love that marriage
between the robust Cabernet Sauvignon


206
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.120
and the splendid Mediterranean
framing of the Bolgheri,


207
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.240
which gives it that…

208
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.040
Can we get the dessert menu?

209
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.960
-Of course.
-Thank you.


210
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.600
Michela, take the dessert menu
to that table there,


211
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.080
and then give me the cordless.

212
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.720
I can't find my fucking cell,
and I have to call my son.


213
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.880
Sure, I'll get it.

214
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.280
Getting old, uh?

215
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.200
I can't dance.

216
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.520
Come on, relax.

217
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.680
Riccardo?

218
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.840
Riccardo.

219
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.240
Riccardo.

220
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.920
<i>I've been calling you for over an hour.</i>

221
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.200
<i>What are you doing?</i>

222
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.000
<i>Can you come to my place</i>
<i>when you close up?</i>


223
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.400
<i>Nothing! You're not answering.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>


224
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.960
<i>Are you at the restaurant</i>
<i>or with the ball and chain?</i>


225
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.280
Oh, God.

226
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.720
Oh, God.

227
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.880
<i>Love, I'm starting to worry.</i>

228
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.000
<i>If this is revenge for the other night,</i>
<i>I'll make you pay for it.</i>


229
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.480
Oh, God.

230
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.480
<i>No, that's not true… But call me.</i>

231
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.760
"Love"?

232
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.240
No.

233
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.680
Don't fuck up!

234
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.440
No.

235
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.960
No!

236
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.680
SIMONE, ANSWER!

237
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.080
SORRY, I CAN'T TALK NOW. I'M AT HOME.

238
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.240
AT HOME? SO I WON'
T SEE YOU TONIGHT?

239
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.880
NO, I CAN'T TONIGHT.

240
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.400
IN FACT… GIVE ME SOME SPACE
FOR A WHILE, RIGHT.


241
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.880
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

242
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.880
MAYBE WE GOT IT ALL WRONG!

243
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.440
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

244
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.480
YOU REALIZE THIS AFTER TWO YEARS?

245
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.800
PLEASE, LOVE, WHAT'S HAPPENING!

246
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.120
Two years!

247
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.520
Two years!

248
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280
What the fuck do you want?

249
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.680
Lavinia's friends ended up being nice.
I expected worse.


250
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.720
Sure they all think
they're who-knows-what.


251
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.680
There's Jonathan, who claims to be
a trapper, but I listened to his song.


252
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.760
<i>I come from the ghetto</i>
<i>And I'll bury you</i>


253
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.840
<i>I'm a sniper</i>
<i>And I'll shoot you</i>


254
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.160
Basically, it's shit,
but in the end, they're all enjoying,


255
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.400
so chill!

256
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.400
What do you want?

257
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.040
Leo, you're my best friend.

258
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.360
I'll always share everything with you.
We'll be best friends forever!


259
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.920
Yeah, you as well.

260
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.200
But that's enough now.

261
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.120
Dad's coming in half an hour, you're eyes
are red, and you're all sweaty!


262
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.240
I swapped with the guys.

263
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.360
Look.

264
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.320
What the fuck's that?

265
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.520
In my scientific opinion,

266
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.680
it's a finely balanced combination
of ecstasy and amphetamine.


267
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.800
-Come on, take it back.
-No, try it, Leone.


268
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.960
Leone, it's the bomb!

269
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.160
I'm flying!

270
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.720
Take it!

271
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.120
-No.
-Put it in your pocket.


272
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.160
My dad's coming in a half-hour!

273
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.600
-There's no more time, then.
-What?


274
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.640
We have to do it now!

275
00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.000
What?

276
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.800
A swim, Leo!

277
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.040
Get out, Jacopo!

278
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.320
Paolo.

279
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.840
What are you doing here?

280
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.280
Simone is cheating on me.

281
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.720
What do I do now?

282
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.760
Sorry.

283
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.040
He'll leave me.

284
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.880
I know it. He'll leave me.

285
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.080
Listen to me.

286
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.760
You know how much I love you.

287
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.760
And you know I'd do anything for you.

288
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.720
But in Simone's shoes,
I'd already have dumped you a while ago.


289
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.360
-What the fuck are you saying?
-Yeah.


290
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.320
Since Leo was born,
you haven't thought about anything


291
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.400
other than baby food,
diapers, pediatricians, vaccinations,


292
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.880
then homework, training, teachers…

293
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.320
-And?
-English courses, a Chinese course…


294
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.720
Where did your relationship go?

295
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.200
Where did Eros go?

296
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.360
After 20 years of marriage, where's Eros?

297
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.520
I don't know. He left. 
He's on vacation.

298
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.080
I thought our relationship
was built on other things.


299
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.120
-On love, I thought.
-So let's talk about love.


300
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.760
How long is it
since you looked Simone in the eyes?


301
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.680
Since you asked him how he is,
what his thoughts are, his fears?


302
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.440
We have so little time.

303
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.480
You need to find the time, Paolo!

304
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.440
I'm speaking out of experience.

305
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.360
Carlo?

306
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.160
Carlo.

307
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.280
-You mean Carlo, Carlo? Our Carlo?
-Our Carlo, yes.


308
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.160
Twenty-six years old.

309
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.720
Yoga teacher.

310
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.000
A chest like two green apples
hanging on a branch,


311
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.000
flexible like a mannequin,
and an ass like solid marble.


312
00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.520
<i>That</i> Carlo?

313
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.520
Yes, <i>that</i> Carlo.

314
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.920
I wanted to surprise him, so I went
to pick him up at the yoga studio,


315
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.680
and I caught them in the car.

316
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.000
She was in the position

317
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.320
"blowjob on the driver."

318
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400
That whore!

319
00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.040
What do you think I should have done?

320
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.680
What?

321
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.440
Rip him a new one. Ruin him.

322
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.880
But I didn't. I didn't.

323
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.400
I forgave him.

324
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.880
I knew it was also my fault.

325
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.840
Do you know what I did?

326
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.320
I proposed a threesome.

327
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.920
What?

328
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.120
A three-way.

329
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.000
I know what a threesome is,
but you didn't…?


330
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.440
Don't worry, that whore said no.

331
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.920
But you see my point?

332
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.240
I didn't give up.

333
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.360
I fought to win him
back, and I did it.

334
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.280
Mom, what's a whore?

335
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.080
Love, where did you hear that word?

336
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.080
You said it.

337
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.760
Get to bed right now.
You have school tomorrow.


338
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.080
-Good night, uncle.
-Good night, honey.


339
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.520
She's got antenna-like ears.

340
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.360
Have you seen my phone by any chance?

341
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.000
No.

342
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.520
Guess what this is.

343
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.280
-What is it?
-Guess what it is.


344
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.680
No.

345
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.360
They said measure the density of a liquid.
They didn't say what liquid.


346
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.960
And this has a high content
of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.


347
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.440
Hey, guys. What are you up to?

348
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.760
Nothing.

349
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.080
Herbal decoction.

350
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.000
Those herbs?

351
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.520
-Yeah, those herbs.
-Have you tried it?


352
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.400
Not yet.

353
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.240
How about trying it tonight?

354
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.600
I can't tonight.

355
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.720
It's my parents' 20th anniversary.

356
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.120
That's nice. Anything planned?

357
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.440
Nothing, just dinner at home,
a cake, sparkling wine…


358
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.520
Too bad.

359
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.040
But you guys could come, though.

360
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.360
It won't be like yesterday's party,
but if you bring your--


361
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.560
Leo, you know how
much I love your family,

362
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.440
but spare me dinner with your folks.

363
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.280
He's right. It'll be criminally boring.

364
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.040
I do like the idea.

365
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.680
Yeah?

366
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.000
After yesterday,
I could use a quiet night.


367
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.880
And my mother won't make a fuss
if we're with your folks.


368
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.680
Can I come even if Jacopo doesn't?

369
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.920
Yes, of course.

370
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.240
-Okay. Can you send me the address?
-Sure.


371
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.080
Leone?

372
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.800
I just sold this chemistry exercise
for 60 euros


373
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.960
to the janitor!

374
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.200
Why are you laughing?

375
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.320
Did you try it?

376
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.480
No, she…

377
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.960
-She tried it?
-No, she didn't try it either.


378
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.720
I'll explain later.

379
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.560
-We'll try it later, okay?
-Yeah.


380
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.920
<i>It's embarrassing.</i>

381
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.840
My family will be there.
They'll treat me like a baby for sure.


382
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.240
What's the problem?

383
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.600
Talking to her
seemed like Mission Impossible.


384
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.680
Now you're complaining
that she's coming over?


385
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.080
True love!

386
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.320
Mr. Paolo said just to set for six.

387
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.160
Yeah, that's fine, Mariela.

388
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.800
Paolo's parents aren't coming,

389
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.080
Monica and Carlo aren't bringing anyone,

390
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.680
and Leone's bringing a girl.

391
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.080
-Thanks, Mariela.
-You're welcome.


392
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.280
Come on, Paolo!

393
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.160
You're a 52-year-old homosexual.
You've seen it all.


394
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.960
You'll survive this betrayal
and this evening as well.


395
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.760
What are you doing?
Talking to the mirror, sir?


396
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.920
-What?
-Everything's ready.


397
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.360
Mr. Simone and Leone
are finishing cooking. I'm going.


398
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.920
Happy anniversary, sir.

399
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.360
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

400
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.560
Come on.

401
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.320
-Good evening!
-Good evening.


402
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.560
Elisa Del Monte. 
Leone, isn't it?

403
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.840
Yes, Ferrari.

404
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.400
Hi, Anna. Dario.

405
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.160
It was very kind of you
to invite Anna. I'll be off,


406
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.120
but I wanted to wish your folks
all the best on their anniversary.


407
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200
Yes. Dad!

408
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.240
Good evening.

409
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.560
-Good evening. I'm Paolo.
-Elisa. Pleased to meet you.


410
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.800
-Hello. You must be Anna.
-Yes.


411
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.400
-Hello.
-And that's Dario.


412
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.640
Hi, Dario.

413
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.920
What a beautiful house.

414
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.160
Thank you.

415
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.800
I wanted to thank you for the invitation

416
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.760
and to congratulate you on this milestone.

417
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.760
Anna told me it's 15 years.

418
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.160
Actually, it's 20.

419
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.000
Well, my most sincere
congratulations, then!


420
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.720
If your wife's here,
I'll congratulate her as well.


421
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.440
She must be busy.
We'll get to know each other another time.


422
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.160
Hello. Anna's mom, I presume?

423
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.200
-Yes, hello.
-Hello. Simone.


424
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.120
You're the cook.

425
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.160
No, though I do cook well.

426
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.080
I'm Leone's other father.

427
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.360
Ah, of course, yes.

428
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.720
I bet someone forgot to mention
today's the anniversary of two men?


429
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.840
Maybe…

430
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.880
Yes. In fact, yes.

431
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.720
Anna, you should have told me,
making me look silly.


432
00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.160
It's not a problem.

433
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.200
No, it really isn't a problem,
of course not.


434
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.760
It's just that I didn't know, so…

435
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.960
All the best!

436
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.000
Thank you.

437
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.000
I was just saying to…

438
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.240
-Paolo.
-Yes, my husband.


439
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.600
-Exactly, yes.
-His husband.


440
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.960
Exactly.

441
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.640
I need to run now. Thank you. Goodbye.

442
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.000
-Bye.
-Goodbye.


443
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.280
Goodbye.

444
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.880
-Leo.
-I had told her.


445
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.320
Everyone at school knows.

446
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.080
It's not a problem, come on.

447
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.000
What?

448
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.680
-Hello.
-Hello.


449
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.360
-Simone, nice to meet you.
-You too. Anna.


450
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.640
-Come in.
-Thank you.


451
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.400
So you're not from Rome, Anna.

452
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.960
No, I just got here.

453
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.800
She's new.
She started at my school this year.


454
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.760
Anna, sorry if I say this,
but you should have warned your mom


455
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.840
that this is a family with two dads.

456
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.520
Why? Does it need to be specified?

457
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.960
I just wanted to see her face.

458
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.920
My mother plays
the modern, open, progressive woman,


459
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.440
but she only understands
the traditional family structure.


460
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.200
But if you tell her she's homophobic,
she replies she has--


461
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.840
Lots of gay friends!

462
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.120
Yes!

463
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.920
Exactly. But I've never met them.

464
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.560
The truth is she can't stand
the idea of a family like yours


465
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.400
maybe being happier than her own.

466
00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.480
Who can that be?

467
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.560
It'll be Mariela.
She'll have forgotten her bag again.


468
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.080
Wait, I've got it.

469
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.160
Can you get the
cake out of the fridge?

470
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.400
Sure.

471
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.320
Of course.

472
00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.120
Coming!

473
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.200
Why are you here, Riccardo? 
Are you crazy?

474
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.640
I've been calling since yesterday.

475
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.680
Why the fuck aren't you answering
your phone?


476
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.440
-Because I lost it!
-Yeah, you lost it!


477
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.720
If you have something to say to me,
say it to my face!


478
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.080
Or is that too much to ask?

479
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.120
I don't know what the fuck's wrong
with you, but you can't be here!


480
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.560
We can talk about it later.
I have to go back inside now.


481
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.320
-To celebrate your anniversary?
-Yeah, so what?


482
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.920
Well done! How sweet!

483
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.160
He knows you've been screwing
someone else for two years?


484
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.000
For fuck's sake, shut up!
My son's here, my in-laws…


485
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.280
-Who cares?
-Keep your voice down!


486
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.360
-Simone, who is it?
-It's a work thing. I'm coming!


487
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.280
You wanna calm down?

488
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.280
What are you thinking, coming here?

489
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.240
Get out of here!

490
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.480
At least have the courage
to look me in the eye and tell me.


491
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.840
Tell you what?

492
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.440
If I think of all
the bullshit you fed me,

493
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.280
that you'd leave him,
that you'd come live with me.


494
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.200
And I believed it like an idiot…

495
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.280
I can't believe you're creating
a scene outside my home.


496
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.720
I don't want to be with someone

497
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.880
who reacts like this
when I don't answer the phone!


498
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.760
Want a hand with the cake?

499
00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880
Who's that?

500
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.560
He had him come here on our anniversary.

501
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240
What are you doing?

502
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.240
You wanna make a scene
in front of everyone?


503
00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.600
Let me go. I've already been patient
long enough!


504
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.200
Please, let me go.

505
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.200
Calm down. Listen to me. Listen.

506
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.600
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

507
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.400
We'll go in there, sit down, eat,

508
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.680
and somehow we'll make it
to the end of the evening.


509
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.520
Then, afterwards,
very calmly and level-headed,


510
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.040
you'll deal with this with Simone.
All right?


511
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.080
Reasonable, the way you know how to be.

512
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.200
-All right?
-All right.


513
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.320
Maybe you'll see things
aren't exactly how you think.


514
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.280
-Exactly, because…
-Because what?


515
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.240
-People exaggerate, don't they?
-Yes.


516
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.600
Maybe that's true.

517
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.400
No!

518
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.320
I'm gonna kill him.

519
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.320
You want Leone to find out
in front of his friend?


520
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.800
Not to mention Carlo, who already
thinks your marriage is a farce.


521
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.920
It is… a farce.

522
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.320
That's what it's become.

523
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.520
There are lots of beautiful things
to see in Rome.


524
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.280
More than Rome, Dad, Anna wanted
to see places just outside Rome.


525
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.360
What do you think about taking her
to Guadagnolo, Dad?


526
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.240
-Guadagnolo?
-Yeah.


527
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.480
Ah, lovely, it's beautiful,
do you remember, Carlo?


528
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.880
Yeah, it's beautiful.

529
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.040
-Couldn't you wait to cut the cake?
-No.


530
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.120
So can we go?

531
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.160
Yes.

532
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.680
Who was at the door?

533
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.480
A supplier from the restaurant.

534
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.440
Sorry, I know it wasn't the ideal time,

535
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.400
but I lost my phone,
so he couldn't reach me.


536
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.880
A supplier?

537
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.840
-Of course.
-Is this vegan cream?


538
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.680
So now the restaurant suppliers
come to our home? At night?


539
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.600
I told you.

540
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.320
-He couldn't get hold of me.
-Of course.


541
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.760
-Suppliers busting our balls!
-Calm down.


542
00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.960
On the evening of our anniversary!

543
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.520
-Yes.
-Stop it.


544
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.480
And as if that's not enough,

545
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.080
the suppliers kiss the master
of the house in the garden!


546
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.840
-Have you gone mad?
-Tell me the truth!


547
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.520
What's happening?

548
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.080
Ask your father!

549
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.200
Did you really kiss the supplier?

550
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.800
Dad?

551
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.160
-What does this mean?
-Nothing.


552
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.160
I'm just sorry for Anna,

553
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.640
who has to witness a scene
of hysteria from him there. I mean…


554
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.720
No problem.

555
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.080
-Why do you have my phone?
-Because you forgot it. That's why.


556
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.520
-You said you hadn't seen it.
-Well, I saw it!


557
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.760
And I also saw all the messages
from Riccardo.


558
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.760
-Who's Riccardo?
-The supplier!


559
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.600
He's been supplying Simone
for two years, right?


560
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.640
-Yes, yes, two years.
-Dad?


561
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.080
I'll explain everything calmly.

562
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.040
How could you do this?

563
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.720
How the fuck could you do this to me?
I trusted you.


564
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.200
Not that much, obviously,
since you went nosing in my cellphone.


565
00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.520
Sure, now it's my fault
for catching you red-handed!


566
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.160
What were you fucking thinking,
reading my messages?


567
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.680
-Don't change the subject!
-Not in front of the kids.


568
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.520
We'll talk about it later.

569
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.360
And we can also talk about

570
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.360
our separation.

571
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.720
You're a piece of shit!
Where the fuck are you going?


572
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.640
I ruined our marriage,

573
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.560
and since it's all my fault,
I'm leaving. You happy?


574
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.040
Yes, I'm happy!
Now who's being hysterical?


575
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.000
-Who's being hysterical?
-Dad!


576
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.160
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving!


577
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.960
Of course! Go on, then! Go!

578
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.320
You ruined everything!

579
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.800
Who's that?

580
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.880
-The supplier again?
-Carlo.


581
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.840
-No, I'll go.
-Leone, please stay out of this!


582
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.520
-Will you let me past?
-I'll go.


583
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.720
-Don't go to the door!
-You just need to shut up!


584
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.960
Nice shitty evening, huh?

585
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.880
My folks never did anything
but scream at each other.


586
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.280
Then they broke up,

587
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.200
and things went much better.

588
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.120
We're still going tomorrow to Guada…

589
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.800
-Guadagnolo.
-Guadagnolo, okay?


590
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.280
-Yeah.
-Okay.


591
00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.280
Anna…

592
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.880
Go on, get out! Fuck off!

593
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.440
It's the first thing I saw.

594
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
It was a really lovely surprise, but…

595
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.680
Where are you going?

596
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.640
Guys…

597
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.000
I love both of you.

598
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.800
We love you as well.

599
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.120
Any other time, it would've been
lovely to be together, but…


600
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.000
Yeah, well done. Go. Go on!

601
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.640
Go fuck yourself!

602
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.280
And don't ever come back!

603
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.080
Who is it?

604
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.360
FORGIVE ME IF YOU CAN… I LOVE YOU.

605
00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.680
Oh, screw you!

606
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.760
-Hi.
-Her fault. I was ready a half-hour ago.


607
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.680
I heard the rock wall
at Guadagnolo is amazing.


608
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.680
My mom said I could come
only if he came too.


609
00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.880
Of course.

610
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.360
It's dangerous to go out
with the son of two hysterical gay men.


611
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.680
Did you tell her about last night?

612
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.480
No. My mother needs to concentrate
on her own problems.


613
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.440
And your mother, Tilly?

614
00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.520
She is your mother, right?

615
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.840
What did she say?

616
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.280
No, she's not my mother.
She's my carrier, my Dede.


617
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.440
That's what I call her.

618
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.960
It's a long story.

619
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.840
Yesterday, when I was watching you,

620
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.080
you looked like a really nice family.

621
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.160
It's a shame.

622
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.680
But I was trying to figure out
who your biological father was.


623
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.200
But I couldn't.
You have something from both of them.


624
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.760
Is it Simone or Paolo?

625
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.720
I don't know.

626
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.120
What?

627
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.800
We don't know.
Do we have to talk about it now?


628
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.320
Of course we do.

629
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.160
You know what a cocktail is?

630
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.280
I'm the child of a sort of cocktail.

631
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.400
My parents got a test tube
and mixed their…


632
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.720
Sperm?

633
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.680
Yeah… that.

634
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.880
That's it.

635
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.000
Then with the egg of a donor,
that mix formed an embryo


636
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.120
that was placed in Tilly's belly,
and after nine months, I came out.


637
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.120
Are you following this?

638
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.880
I think so.

639
00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.160
WILL YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE?

640
00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.480
Beautiful, huh?

641
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.800
It was worth it in the end.

642
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.920
Great. The rock wall is brilliant.

643
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.840
Are you guys climbing too?

644
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.280
-Up there?
-Yes.


645
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.360
I'll pass.

646
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.520
Leone, you?

647
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.080
It's a bit high.

648
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.560
I brought equipment for you,

649
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.960
and I'm here if need be.

650
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.840
-I'll go up and prepare the route.
-I'll film the ascent.


651
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.600
You don't have to do it.

652
00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.800
No, I can do it.

653
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.600
Are you sure?

654
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.560
-He's good, eh?
-Yeah, he's good.


655
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.680
-Very good.
-Very.


656
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.240
It's easy, come on.

657
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.040
Rope!

658
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.160
Okay, I'll go.

659
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.040
Take your time, Leone.

660
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.360
Look for the grips for your feet
and hands, and climb slowly.


661
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.080
Good.

662
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.800
That one there.

663
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.240
Go.

664
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.400
-There.
-How's it going?


665
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.520
Okay.

666
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.560
-Put your hand there.
-Here?


667
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.520
In front of your knee.

668
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.240
Look for a grip there.

669
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.640
Go. Well done.

670
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.840
Good.

671
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.160
Easy.

672
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.800
Leo, you okay?

673
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.440
Yeah.

674
00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.560
Get back on the wall.

675
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.520
Please, be careful.

676
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Go.

677
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.640
Go.

678
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.360
Careful!

679
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.240
You okay?

680
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.520
Okay. Come on.

681
00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.640
That's it.

682
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.360
Hand.

683
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.200
Well done!

684
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.280
You made it, see? 
You did really well.

685
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.480
Without you, I'd still be hanging there.

686
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.720
She's not going to
post the video, is she?

687
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.840
Why not? You'd make
a good impression if she did.


688
00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.280
You proved your courage.

689
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.280
Why not?

690
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.160
I wish I had the same courage
in other areas.


691
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.320
I like being with you.

692
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.320
Really.

693
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.760
It's rare to find guys like you.

694
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.040
And that makes me think, because

695
00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.880
finally…

696
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.280
You're the first gay guy I've liked.
I don't know what to do.


697
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.480
But I'm not gay.

698
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.720
-What do you mean?
-I'm not gay.


699
00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.240
But your folks are fags. I mean…

700
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.080
-My folks…
-No.


701
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.880
-I don't believe this.
-I didn't mean that. Leone.


702
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.720
Anna told me as well.
How can you not be gay?


703
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.840
My parents are gay!

704
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.200
My parents are gay!

705
00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.720
And I'm not! Yours are straight,
and you clearly aren't!


706
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.040
It's not a contagious disease
that you catch!


707
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.160
Are you gonna tell anyone?

708
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.040
You'll keep it to yourself?

709
00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.640
Good boy.

710
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.680
-Leone, are you okay?
-Your brother's an asshole.


711
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.640
Sorry, but he still hasn't
come to grips with this.


712
00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.800
You knew.

713
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.960
-You did this to set me up with him.
-No!


714
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.920
Yes, I knew he liked you,
and I thought you liked him too.


715
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.240
That's why you were
so interested in my folks.


716
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.320
Always so sweet and nice.

717
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.640
You even wanted to come to my house.

718
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.680
I just wanted to help him.

719
00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.000
Look, all my life, people have called
me a fag because of my parents.


720
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.320
I'm sorry to let you down.

721
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.840
It'd be great if I were gay.

722
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.800
But I'm simply not.

723
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.360
I'm not.

724
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.080
You really haven't
figured out why I'm here?


725
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.720
Because I like you, Anna. You.

726
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.800
I thought you were here for me.

727
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.560
My fault.

728
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.720
Sorry.

729
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.440
Hi, Dad.

730
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.280
Hey, love. How'd your trip go?

731
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.160
It went.

732
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.280
How are you?

733
00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.480
Fine.

734
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.160
I see you've changed things a bit.

735
00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.160
Yes, I did a bit of cleaning.
Are you hungry?


736
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.520
Want something to eat?

737
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.480
No.

738
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.960
Sorry, what are you doing?

739
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.040
Cleaning up a bit.

740
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.320
You're throwing out Dad's wine?

741
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:16.480
You mean your father's pretentious
little wine collection? Yes.


742
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.680
It mattered to him.

743
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.440
Only because he got
his sommelier's certificate.


744
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.040
And this?

745
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.280
I'm sorry, Dad.

746
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.480
I'm gonna go to bed. 
I'm a bit tired.

747
00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.280
I'm sorry.
It wasn't meant to go like that.


748
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.400
I was a dickhead. I admit it.

749
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.360
There, good boy.

750
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.560
Well done.

751
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.120
But…

752
00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.560
I don't believe you don't want me anymore.

753
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.280
The chemistry teacher
liked the decoction, it seems.


754
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.720
He must have tried it.
He gave me 10 out of 10.


755
00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:03.440
Leone.

756
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.800
How long do you plan to ignore me?

757
00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.960
Can I remind you we
go to the same school?

758
00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.560
Leone, I'm going home.

759
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.520
Anna, leave me alone.

760
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.520
What do I have to do?
Get down on one knee?


761
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.160
-If you want, I will.
-This is all a joke to you, isn't it?


762
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.320
Don't exaggerate.
I couldn't have known that--


763
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.400
What? That I'm not gay?

764
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.320
Sorry, my fault for not telling you.

765
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.280
No, Leone.

766
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.760
Stop!

767
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.760
You weren't wrong.

768
00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.800
About what?

769
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.640
The fact that I like you a little.

770
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.080
Your father's there.

771
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.000
The cool one.

772
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.000
We'll talk about it later.

773
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.160
Yeah.

774
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.360
Hey.

775
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.480
What are you doing here?

776
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.880
I wanted to be with
my son for a while.

777
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.800
You want something to eat?

778
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.160
A nice pizza?

779
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.080
Dad's hurting, and you don't give a shit.

780
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.880
It's not easy for me either.

781
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.360
You're the one responsible for this mess.

782
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.360
I had a secret relationship for months.

783
00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.040
I'm a shit. I'm dishonest, I know.

784
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.480
But don't think it's all my fault.

785
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.840
Things are never black or white.

786
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.640
We got to this point together.

787
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.040
Sometimes things go a way that
you find yourself in something.


788
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.600
You don't even know how.

789
00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.360
You don't know.

790
00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.800
I tried, Leo.

791
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.960
We tried. But it didn't work.

792
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.360
What I did is wrong, I know.

793
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.280
But it's a consequence, not a cause.

794
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.800
Do you understand that?

795
00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.960
I don't know.

796
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.760
Listen, you wanna tell me about Anna?

797
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.920
-She seems like a cool one to me.
-Are you coming home?


798
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.800
-Did you go for a hike?
-Dad, are you coming home?


799
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.080
I don't know. Not now.

800
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.800
I'll always be there for you.

801
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.520
Always.

802
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.600
You'll never be free of me.

803
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.520
So, this pizza?

804
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.040
Where can we go?

805
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.480
Another time, Dad, okay?

806
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:02.200
IMPORTANT NEWS TO TELL YOU IN PERSON.
MY OFFICE TOMORROW MORNING.


807
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.400
That's all we needed.

808
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.160
Guys, I'm sorry
to have to give you this news,


809
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.360
but the Supreme Court has come out
against double paternity.


810
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.600
What?

811
00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.760
So we're not both parents now
in the eyes of the law?


812
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.440
And now?

813
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.520
They might ask you to go back
to the previous situation.


814
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:27.560
That is, to where legally
I'm Leo's only parent, right?


815
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.200
-No, why?
-That's not certain.


816
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.120
Because you've never wanted
to know who Leone's father is,


817
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.840
they might ask for further investigations.

818
00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.840
Unfortunately, for example,
they might ask for a DNA test.


819
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.360
So we could be forced to take a test
to see who the biological father is?


820
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.120
It's possible, indeed. 
It's very likely.

821
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.400
No! This sounds like something
the Nazis would've done.


822
00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.880
We should just go back
to the previous situation!


823
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.520
Why? It's not up to you!

824
00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.720
It's the law, no me!

825
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.280
-The law says something else.
-The previous situation.


826
00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:06.040
Italian law is for <i>favor veritatis</i>
rather than <i>favor minoris.</i>


827
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.000
-What the fuck does that mean?
-I'll explain.


828
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.240
The determination of parenthood
in this country


829
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.280
is only established through
the genetic link with the child.


830
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.560
-Only?
-Only.


831
00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.600
Only, sure.

832
00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.400
I don't know, Domenico.
Being forced like this.


833
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.680
Doing a DNA test
would be traumatic for all of us


834
00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.560
and especially for Leo, I mean…

835
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.200
I'M HERE, BUT WHERE R U?

836
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.160
Behind you, but keep your eyes closed.

837
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.760
Why?

838
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.320
Did you get me a present?

839
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.680
Yes.

840
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.320
This.

841
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.280
Do you like it?

842
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.120
Why me?

843
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.040
Because you've been nice.

844
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.680
Yeah?

845
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.400
-When?
-Always.


846
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.240
Even when you were swinging
on that rock wall.


847
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.600
God, no, please delete that video.

848
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.080
I can't.

849
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.440
It's in here,
and it'll stay there forever.


850
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.160
-Are you sure?
-Yes.


851
00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.560
Then you won't…

852
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.200
Oh, God, are you sure?

853
00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.960
I'm not ready for a scene.

854
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.120
Don't worry. Paolo's at a trade fair,
and Leone's at the park.


855
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.160
It won't take long.

856
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.760
What's he done?

857
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.560
He's changed everything.

858
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.880
-I don't have a lot. It won't take long.
-You're really only taking books?


859
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.280
Everything else is his.

860
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.960
The shop, the house,
the restaurant, they're all Paolo's.


861
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.360
From all the years spent together,
I have nothing.


862
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.240
The only thing of value I have
are my bottles in the kitchen.


863
00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.200
Actually, they're there on the rack.

864
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.600
Can you get them?
We'll take them to the restaurant?


865
00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.880
Sure.

866
00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.280
This is mine.

867
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.840
I gave this to him ten years ago!

868
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.080
-He never even opened it.
-I can't see them!


869
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:15.960
Wait, I'm coming.

870
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.080
I told you, the rack on the right.

871
00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.240
No.

872
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:34.960
No!

873
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.520
-Did he throw all your wine away?
-No!


874
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.360
I can't believe it!

875
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.760
No!

876
00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.200
The Sassicaia as well! No!

877
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:49.640
The piece of shit!

878
00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.760
You'll pay for this.

879
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.960
-Calm down.
-Don't touch me!


880
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.120
Where is it?

881
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.200
There, you like your Prada?

882
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.240
Stop it.

883
00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:25.360
Get off!

884
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.600
No, don't touch me!

885
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.160
I haven't finished!

886
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.480
Leave it! What the fuck are you doing?

887
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.880
Come on, forget it.
Simo, it's not worth it!


888
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.920
It's not worth it.

889
00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.240
Forget it.

890
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.200
There's a bag there.

891
00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680
Okay.

892
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.640
He's got enough tranquilizers
for a psych ward.


893
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.440
Don't go there.

894
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.080
No, that's Leone's.

895
01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.400
-Your son uses this?
-Mm-hmm.


896
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.880
So this is Leone's hair?

897
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.600
Yeah.

898
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.320
If they force you
to take the DNA test,

899
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.920
it might be a good idea
to have the answer in advance, right?


900
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.400
Leone will never do it. Forget it.

901
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.680
Yes, but there are hair bulbs here,
and hair bulbs contain DNA.


902
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.960
Do you wanna be caught unprepared?

903
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.240
I'll deal with it.

904
01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.080
No!

905
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.880
No!

906
01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.720
What happened?

907
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.280
Look!

908
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.280
Look at what he's capable of.

909
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.200
Was that Dad?

910
01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.360
He came here

911
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.520
and slashed my Prada!

912
01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.800
Is it maybe because
you threw away his wine, Dad?


913
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.160
And him? What did he throw away?

914
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.200
He flushed our whole family
down the toilet!


915
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.680
It's never just the fault
of one person, Dad.


916
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.600
It's him.

917
01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.960
He's filling your head
with bullshit. Tell the truth.


918
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.200
Of course, he went
to school. You saw him!

919
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.280
Listen to me.

920
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.480
You mustn't speak with him ever again.
Do you understand?


921
01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.040
You mustn't ever see him again, never!

922
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.360
Don't you think you're exaggerating, Dad?

923
01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.080
Exaggerating? Me?

924
01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.080
-Whose side are you on, love?
-I'm not on anyone's side, Dad!


925
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.440
All right, you wanna
go and live with him?

926
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.360
Go and live with him!

927
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.200
Go! You leave me as well! Go!

928
01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.800
You're impossible to talk to!
You always have been!


929
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.480
You don't fucking listen, Dad!

930
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.400
Look, do what you like.
Just leave me alone.


931
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.560
Hello?

932
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.800
Domenico, it's me.

933
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.080
We have to tear him a new one.

934
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.600
-Take him to the cleaners!
-Don't be like that.


935
01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.120
No, you don't understand.

936
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.960
This is war!

937
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.520
Did she give you that?

938
01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.560
Okay.

939
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.520
It'll never happen to me.

940
01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.360
I'm jealous.

941
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.600
No, thanks.

942
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.760
Oh, what's with this face?

943
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.440
My folks.

944
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.120
I never thought I'd see them
torment each other like children.


945
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.520
Why don't you film them?

946
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.240
This is the twist
we were looking for. It's perfect!


947
01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.040
What the fuck are you talking about?

948
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.880
It'll make our project shine.

949
01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.520
Listen, Jacopo. We're not making
the documentary anymore, okay?


950
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.480
-Who decided that?
-I did.


951
01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.800
This is my family! I decide.

952
01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.480
It's also my end-of-year assignment.

953
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.480
We did it together
from the very beginning.


954
01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.480
You know the effort I put into it.
You can't do this!


955
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.920
Leone!

956
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.280
They're two shitty people.

957
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.680
I don't want anything more
to do with them, you understand?


958
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.800
Put it in the documentary.
Say what you think.


959
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.360
"They're two shitty people." Go!

960
01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.880
Start with a happy scene, and then--

961
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.320
Fuck you, Jacopo!

962
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.920
This is what happens to everyone, Leone.

963
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.880
Welcome to the real world.

964
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.000
Wasn't that the point?

965
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.840
To show that your family's
as shitty as mine?


966
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.200
As everyone's?

967
01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.920
Fuck you.

968
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.800
…the wine in the cellar.
How much would we save?


969
01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.560
Ale, please, don't joke around.
We need the microwave.


970
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.480
I think instead, we don't need
the work surface in Carrara marble.


971
01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.680
How much is the mosaic?

972
01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.000
What do you think?

973
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:25.960
Too much, I think.

974
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.000
I'll smash your face in,
you fucking dickhead!


975
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.160
He's gonna hear from me!

976
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.080
-Hey, dickhead!
-Maybe mosaic isn't such a bad idea.


977
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.320
Where the fuck is he?

978
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.880
-Get down here!
-One moment.


979
01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.600
I'll go and see if we have
any mosaic on special.


980
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.520
I'll be right back.

981
01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.200
What are you doing here?

982
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.960
Where the fuck are you going?

983
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.560
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck does this mean?


984
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.880
You can't sell the restaurant!

985
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.080
If I'm not mistaken, the property is mine.

986
01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.840
We had an agreement.

987
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.240
I ran your place and contributed
to the family expenses.


988
01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.800
Sure, we also had
another agreement called marriage.


989
01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.480
But I'm sorry. 
We don't have that anymore!

990
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.200
What the fuck are you doing?

991
01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.080
Don't put your hands on me! Don't…

992
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.840
I want you to immediately cancel the sale!

993
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.280
-Yeah?
-Yeah.


994
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.200
We're issuing threats now.
Wait a moment, excuse me.


995
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.040
-There.
-God, what a clown you are!


996
01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.880
Come on, talk now, talk! Go.

997
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.200
I gave up my PhD

998
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.160
because I had to work to contribute
to the upkeep of the family!


999
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.480
-You asked me to!
-And what about me?


1000
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:37.800
I could've been a great architect,
and here I am selling shitty kitchens!


1001
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.840
You're free now! Go! Go!

1002
01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.360
Just leave us alone, Leone and me!

1003
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.320
-You're free, go!
-Leave Leone out of this, Paolo!


1004
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.760
Help! He's threatening me! Help!

1005
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.640
-Help!
-Don't try to turn him against me


1006
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.680
because I really won't be responsible
for my actions, I won't!


1007
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.680
Don't touch me! 
I'll call the police!

1008
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.360
-Yeah?
-All right?


1009
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.280
-Will you stop it?
-What?


1010
01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.080
Stop acting like Leo is only your son.

1011
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.880
Leone <i>is</i> only my son.

1012
01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.560
You can see it clearly! 
He looks like me!

1013
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.800
Paolo, this madness
about the physical resemblance


1014
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.360
only exists in your sick mind.

1015
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.280
Leone loves music, history,
the mountains, animals, like me!


1016
01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.800
Sure, you love animals?

1017
01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.760
When you eat them roasted!

1018
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.960
I'm going to ask the lawyer
for custody of Leone.


1019
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.200
You poor deluded fool! Really?

1020
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.480
No judge in their right mind
would trust you with a dog,


1021
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.600
much less a son!

1022
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.800
Leone's my son.

1023
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.480
Do you want to bet?

1024
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.880
Yes, let's bet. Either way,
we'll soon know for sure.


1025
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.360
Excuse me? Why would we…

1026
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.360
Because…

1027
01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.080
Just because!

1028
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.120
You did the DNA test, didn't you?

1029
01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.480
Yes.

1030
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.440
So what?

1031
01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.680
Watch out, Paolo.

1032
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.920
After 20 years, you still don't know
what I'm capable of.


1033
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.880
Threaten me! I've recorded everything!

1034
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.280
Come on, threaten me!
I've recorded everything.


1035
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.640
Fuck! It didn't start recording! Fuck!

1036
01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.600
Fuck, there's no special on mosaic!

1037
01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.320
What kind of shop
doesn't have mosaic on special?


1038
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.360
So you and I…

1039
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.920
What?

1040
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.680
I mean, are we together?

1041
01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.760
-Well, yes. We're in the same room.
-Come on. Be serious.


1042
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.560
I don't know. You tell me.

1043
01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.480
I'd like that.

1044
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.640
So?

1045
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.920
Yes, so?

1046
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.920
So?

1047
01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.240
You wanna go out with me?

1048
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.760
-Is that a yes?
-Yes.


1049
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.680
Yes.

1050
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.600
-Yes.
-Yes?


1051
01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.320
-My gay boyfriend.
-That's enough of that.


1052
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.600
-Don't get upset.
-You promised to lock him in his room.


1053
01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.800
-I did.
-With the key?


1054
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.400
-Yes.
-Okay.


1055
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.240
But you must've asked yourself
at least once.


1056
01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.000
Everyone does.

1057
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.120
I thought I was in love
with a girlfriend of mine.


1058
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.360
But then I kissed her,

1059
01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.720
and we just started laughing.

1060
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.360
You?

1061
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.160
Nothing?

1062
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.720
I…

1063
01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.680
I thought about it, I asked myself,
and I even asked my folks.


1064
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:05.240
They said, "If you were,
you wouldn't be asking us now."


1065
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.840
For me, you can be whatever you like,
as long as you like me.


1066
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.600
Are you sure
your mother isn't coming back?


1067
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.160
-Yes. Very sure.
-Okay.


1068
01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.680
Send a message to your folks.
Say you're staying over here.


1069
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.680
Okay.

1070
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.520
-Is this your first time?
-I…


1071
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.480
Yeah. You?

1072
01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.440
No, but it'll be different with you.

1073
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.440
No, no, come in…

1074
01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.720
I'm finished. I'll go get dressed
in my room. Come in.


1075
01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.600
Leone, sorry.

1076
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.640
Yeah, I have to say sorry
for the other day, the way I behaved.


1077
01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.760
I'm sorry, I was a dick.

1078
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.640
I was never able to say it to anyone,
not even to myself,


1079
01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.040
and for some reason,
I was able to say it to you.


1080
01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:38.400
Now I feel freer and lighter.

1081
01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.520
If you like, we can be friends.

1082
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.120
Well, if you teach me
to climb like you, maybe…


1083
01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.320
All right, I'll teach you
to climb like me. Come here.


1084
01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.800
-Dario!
-Mom!


1085
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.120
-Dario, open this door!
-Do it, or she'll think…


1086
01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.280
Dario!

1087
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.320
What's wrong, Mom?

1088
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.000
What's going on in this house!

1089
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.000
Why's Dario in the bathroom with him?
And why are you half-naked?


1090
01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.080
Open the door!

1091
01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.400
-I'll say, "Mom, I'm a fag."
-You can't say that.


1092
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.280
She'll think you're having sex with me!

1093
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.520
I'll jump out the window.
You do whatever the fuck you like!


1094
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.120
Dario, open this door!

1095
01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.080
Mom.

1096
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.680
Yes, you got it right. I'm gay.

1097
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.040
And thanks to Leone,
I finally managed to face the truth


1098
01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.720
and understand who I really am.

1099
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.400
Mom, I'm gay.

1100
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.160
-Explain properly.
-"Explain properly"?


1101
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.080
I don't care about you or your parents.

1102
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.520
What have my parents to do with it?

1103
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.200
But this is a normal house!
Get it? Normal!


1104
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.560
-Normal, Mom?
-Why? What's not normal?


1105
01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.960
-Can we still say that word?
-No, you can't, Mom!


1106
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.200
Aren't I allowed to want
what's best for my children?


1107
01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.520
Normal, like Dad fucking
a girl not much older than me?


1108
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.720
Or like you searching for cocks online?

1109
01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.360
Don't you dare! What do you know?
You're still a kid! You're all kids!


1110
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.960
Go to your room.
You get the hell out of here.


1111
01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.920
No, he stays here. Mom!

1112
01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.160
Dario, honey, you know you can talk
to me about anything, right?


1113
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.280
It's normal to be confused
at your age, I can assure you.


1114
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.680
You just have to avoid
the wrong experiences. Is that clear?


1115
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.080
Mom, those are the experiences
I want! Stop it!


1116
01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.480
So, you and him, last night…

1117
01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.680
No!

1118
01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.720
Mom, you're ridiculous.
As usual, you haven't understood a thing!


1119
01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.880
Actually, I love your daughter, ma'am.

1120
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.720
No, wait, right. You…

1121
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.240
Dario… Leone…

1122
01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.760
Enough! Go to school.
All of you out of here! One, two, three!


1123
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.360
Out of here! Go!

1124
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.000
Well done.

1125
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.920
It's here.

1126
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.640
How many of you are there?

1127
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.680
Send message.

1128
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.640
Who is it?

1129
01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.680
Hey.

1130
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920
Am I interrupting?

1131
01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.960
No, I wasn't expecting you,

1132
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.720
but come in.

1133
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.360
This is for you.

1134
01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.320
For me?

1135
01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.680
It's not really a Prada.

1136
01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.520
I can't afford that at the moment,

1137
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.080
but it's really similar.

1138
01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.280
Almost identical.

1139
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.920
Yeah, in fact, it says "Frada."

1140
01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.880
Thank you.

1141
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.360
Thank you, Paolo, I mean it.

1142
01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360
I really appreciated your gesture.

1143
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600
Of course.

1144
01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.480
I didn't expect you to give me
the restaurant practically for nothing.


1145
01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.520
I only did it for Leone.

1146
01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.880
Sure, for Leone.

1147
01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:56.960
Basically, what we both want
is for the good of…


1148
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.320
our son.

1149
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.080
Why are you ashamed to say it?

1150
01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.080
Our son.

1151
01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.480
Our son, yes.

1152
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.760
We saw him being born

1153
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.440
growing up, learning to walk, ride a bike.

1154
01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.120
To fall off it.

1155
01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.600
Someone wanted to take
the training wheels off.


1156
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.400
Well, it was time. I mean,
he was old enough, he seemed--


1157
01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.640
He wasn't even four--

1158
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.400
-Sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.


1159
01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.880
What matters is we were there for him
at the difficult moments.


1160
01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.320
We were there for the important moments.

1161
01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.080
Yeah.

1162
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.360
Above all, we managed to teach him values,

1163
01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:49.360
to help him become someone
who's responsible, independent,


1164
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.960
compassionate.

1165
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.080
Yes.

1166
01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.520
We can be proud of him.

1167
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.880
Right, listen, excuse me, Simone.

1168
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:10.120
If we didn't care about the DNA
before, why should we care now?


1169
01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.880
But that's what I think!

1170
01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.040
Yeah?

1171
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.760
Paolo,

1172
01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.640
I'm telling you the truth.

1173
01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.480
We can't change what happened,

1174
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.440
but now we have to
move on responsibly, no?


1175
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.720
And with respect.

1176
01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.640
And with respect.

1177
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.120
We agree.

1178
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.840
You know, a little while ago,

1179
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.560
I was in his room, and Leone
has all his things here, his world…


1180
01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.760
It would be nice
if he could keep feeling at home


1181
01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.240
both at your place and at mine.

1182
01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.360
Paolo, at mine?

1183
01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.120
At mine.

1184
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.280
At yours?

1185
01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.320
At mine and at yours.

1186
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.560
At mine?

1187
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.680
You're a great man, Paolo.
I have to admit it.


1188
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.680
But I don't know how I'll react when I see
Leone walking out of this house.


1189
01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.320
Why? Because he'll come to see me
once a week? That's all it is.


1190
01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.360
Don't fuck with me now.

1191
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.640
What do you mean?

1192
01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:36.400
Simone, we can think
what we like, all right?


1193
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.120
We might even become friends
again in the future.


1194
01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:46.440
But from a legal point of view,
Leone will have to live with you.


1195
01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:47.760
With me?

1196
01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.920
-With you!
-What?


1197
01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.840
Don't start again.
Simone, you're the biological father!


1198
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.840
Me? But you are, Paolo!

1199
01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.200
Stop! You know very well it's you!

1200
01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.120
-Paolo, don't joke about this!
-No, you stop. Please!


1201
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.560
Me? Joking? I would never joke
about something like this!


1202
01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.720
You really are a clown.

1203
01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.120
-Read this.
-Look at this.


1204
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.520
What the fuck does this mean?

1205
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.840
Together, you and me, we don't share
even 0.1 percent of Leone's DNA.


1206
01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.840
Good Lord, we've nothing to do with him.

1207
01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.760
We've nothing in common with our son!
What the fuck does this mean?


1208
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.280
What is all this? 
What does it mean?

1209
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.040
Is this a joke?
What the fuck does it mean?


1210
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.960
What the fuck does it mean?

1211
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.200
What the fuck does it mean?

1212
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.080
Here's Leone.

1213
01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.400
Hey.

1214
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.440
Hi, Leo.

1215
01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.280
What are you doing here, together?

1216
01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:14.600
What's happening?

1217
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.320
Sit down, Leone. 
We need to talk to you.

1218
01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.360
We have to explain something.

1219
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:25.200
Something's happened
that we really weren't expecting.


1220
01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.600
No.

1221
01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.680
That's my name on it.

1222
01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.520
Yes, it's your name. Yes.

1223
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.000
Is that a test?

1224
01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.480
Yes, it's a test. Yes.

1225
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.280
What kind?

1226
01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.080
DNA?

1227
01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.920
Yes, DNA.

1228
01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.000
You did a DNA test?

1229
01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.080
-Yeah.
-Without even asking me!


1230
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.400
How did you do it?

1231
01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.200
Love, you live here.
There are traces all over the place.


1232
01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:09.040
-A glass, chewing gum.
-Hair on your brush.


1233
01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.080
-I can't believe it.
-Wait, Leo.


1234
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.840
I know it may sound like we overstepped.

1235
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.200
But I assure you, we
did it for your sake.

1236
01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.080
All the bullshit you
fed me all my life!

1237
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.760
"What does DNA matter, blood?"

1238
01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:26.000
"We're a family based
on love and sincerity!"


1239
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.640
All bullshit!

1240
01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.480
Maybe we were wrong…

1241
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.080
You have to understand, under Italian law,

1242
01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.200
we had to figure
out how to protect you.

1243
01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.000
So you thought you'd
get some traces of me

1244
01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.520
and send them to a laboratory
without asking me? Well done.


1245
01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.400
So, who won?

1246
01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.280
Who's my father? 
Who's the winner?

1247
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.680
-Well…
-Eh?


1248
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.680
This is a question to be addressed calmly.

1249
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.000
Paolo's right.

1250
01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.280
It's a delicate matter.

1251
01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.440
It doesn't seem that difficult!
Either it's you, or it's you.


1252
01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.440
Well?

1253
01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.960
It's neither Paolo nor me.

1254
01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.760
The DNA says we're not your parents.

1255
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.960
What the fuck are you saying?

1256
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.840
Listen, Leone.
We need to understand this as well.


1257
01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.320
In fact, we called Tilly,
and she's on her way.


1258
01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.840
Yes, your Dede
has to explain to us what happened.


1259
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.120
No, Leone, we'll discuss it calmly.

1260
01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.840
Calmly, Dad?

1261
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920
-Yes.
-Calmly.


1262
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.640
Calmly. Go…

1263
01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.800
You two are insane!

1264
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.800
Insane!

1265
01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.560
-Leo, where are you going?
-Wait.


1266
01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.320
Fuck off!

1267
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.000
Have you seen Jacopo?
At least he's trying.


1268
01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.200
He was good.

1269
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.600
Well done, Jacopo.

1270
01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.080
I've decided to start a new life.

1271
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.600
Listen, my sister said
you're not answering her messages.


1272
01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.880
I told her you were here.

1273
01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.000
I hope I haven't messed up.

1274
01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.760
See you later. Well done.

1275
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.360
-Yes, I'll join you in a minute.
-Okay.


1276
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.760
What's up, Leo?

1277
01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.080
-Everything okay?
-Yes.


1278
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.680
Go on. I'll…

1279
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.240
join you in a minute.

1280
01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:27.000
All right. See that you do.

1281
01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.600
-Leone!
-Has he not got a rope?


1282
01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.760
What's he doing?

1283
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.760
Leone, what the fuck are you doing?

1284
01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.120
Leone!

1285
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.000
-Dario, what now?
-Get the mattresses.


1286
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.240
-Is that enough?
-Get the blue ones.


1287
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.160
Put them on top.

1288
01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.720
-Why'd you go up?
-Wait, I'm going higher.


1289
01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.600
-No, what are you doing?
-Come down! Leone!


1290
01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.520
-Get down!
-Where the fuck are you going?


1291
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.120
You need to come
down, not keep going up!

1292
01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.200
Leone, please.

1293
01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.360
Come down.

1294
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.760
You're giving us a heart attack.

1295
01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.960
Come down.

1296
01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.080
Leone, look at me and come down.

1297
01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.520
Leone!

1298
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.120
Come down slowly. 
Really slowly.

1299
01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.520
Leone, you've got no rope, please!
You could hurt yourself.


1300
01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.200
Okay, I'm coming down. 
I'm coming down.

1301
01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.400
God, how can he get down?

1302
01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.640
Use the blue grips.

1303
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.520
The big ones are all good. Use those.

1304
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.880
-The grips?
-White and blue.


1305
01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.160
That one's yellow!

1306
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.600
-The white and blue ones!
-Easy, Leone.


1307
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.680
Take it easy.

1308
01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.360
Easy, Leone, easy.

1309
01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.800
Come down.

1310
01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.720
-Easy, Leone!
-Leone, easy!


1311
01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.760
Leone!

1312
01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.040
My love, how are you?

1313
01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:30.400
What happened?

1314
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.880
Why did you do it?

1315
01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.600
I… think I needed

1316
01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.720
to breathe a bit.

1317
01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.080
You were tripping.

1318
01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.800
You don't do that on your own.

1319
01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.320
You'll never change, Jacopo.

1320
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.320
I feel guilty 'cause you got
that stuff from me.


1321
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.040
It has nothing to do with you.
I did it all myself.


1322
01:29:58.920 --> 01:29:59.960
In fact…

1323
01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.560
-Don't get up.
-Don't get up, you'll…


1324
01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.280
I never tell you,

1325
01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.800
but I love you, my friend.

1326
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.520
It's about time.

1327
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.040
Come here. Give me a hug.

1328
01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.560
But take it slow.

1329
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.320
We told your folks, though.

1330
01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.000
What the fuck, Jacopo?

1331
01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.400
We had to, sorry.

1332
01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.080
Yeah, but I'm okay.

1333
01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.920
Yeah, you're in great shape.

1334
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.480
Leone! My son's name is Leone!

1335
01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.920
-How many Leones do you have here?
-Okay…


1336
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Leone Ferrari. 
We were told he's here.

1337
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.040
Are you his mother?

1338
01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.320
No, I'm his aunt,
and this is his father.

1339
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.640
I'm his father. Where is he?

1340
01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:45.240
Leone Ferrari, room 103, first floor.

1341
01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.280
103, first floor.

1342
01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.320
Where's the first floor?

1343
01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.600
-Where is it?
-This way.


1344
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.400
Leone, my love! 
You're still alive!

1345
01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.760
How are you?

1346
01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.280
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, fine.


1347
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.800
-What did you do?
-Hi, Auntie.


1348
01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.600
What did you do, honey? Eh?

1349
01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.760
I fell.

1350
01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:07.040
He's just a bit bruised.

1351
01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.600
The CAT scan came back fine, so…

1352
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.960
The doctor said he can go home tomorrow.

1353
01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.560
No. I want to go home tonight.

1354
01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.360
What happened?

1355
01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.720
Nothing, Dad.
I was climbing a rock wall and…


1356
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.120
A rock wall?

1357
01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.440
Without protection.

1358
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.080
Sorry, Dad, I fucked up.

1359
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.640
We've all been fucking up lately.

1360
01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.480
I'm sorry.

1361
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.160
Everything's all right.

1362
01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.120
Okay? Everything's all right.

1363
01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.120
Oh God, I'm going to faint. 
I need to sit.

1364
01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.520
Shall we go?

1365
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.840
You've taken 40 years off my life!

1366
01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.880
We'll go, Mr. Ferrari.

1367
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.120
Yes, we'll deal with this.
Thank you. You get some sleep.


1368
01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.040
Bye.

1369
01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.440
Thanks. Good night.

1370
01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.160
We'll call you. Thank you.

1371
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.360
Bye, Leone.

1372
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.200
Good evening! Leone Ferrari.
He's just been admitted.


1373
01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:10.720
Where is he?

1374
01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:12.120
-Who are you?
-His father.


1375
01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.840
His father's already here.

1376
01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.200
I'm his other dad!

1377
01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.240
Can you tell me where he is?

1378
01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.880
Extended family.

1379
01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.080
Room 103, first floor.

1380
01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.000
Thank you!

1381
01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.240
You see that? That kid has two dads,
but mine ran away to America.


1382
01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.720
Leone!

1383
01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.960
Darling, how are you?

1384
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.560
-Hi, Dad.
-He's fine.


1385
01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.480
Don't make that face. I'm fine.

1386
01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.160
What happened?

1387
01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.720
Nothing really.
He just tried to kill himself


1388
01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.760
by climbing a 30-foot rock wall
without protective equipment!


1389
01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.800
Leone.

1390
01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:59.120
I know you have lousy parents,
but never do that again.


1391
01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:00.800
Don't ever do it again.

1392
01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.240
It was an accident. 
I wasn't suicidal.

1393
01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.840
Oh God, what a fright you gave me.

1394
01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.440
Does Auntie know?

1395
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.960
What?

1396
01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.920
The DNA.

1397
01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.880
Of course, I know everything.

1398
01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.560
-And what do you think?
-What can I say?


1399
01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.200
Leo, absolutely nothing changes.

1400
01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.160
-Of course nothing changes.
-Why should anything change?


1401
01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.120
And what happens now?

1402
01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:49.760
We need to speak to Tilly.
She owes us an explanation.


1403
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.120
So the cocktail didn't work?

1404
01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:55.880
The cocktail?

1405
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.280
It's a family thing.

1406
01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.200
Good evening!

1407
01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.320
Yes. And who are you?

1408
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.720
I'm his Dede.

1409
01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.720
His Dede.

1410
01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.360
Dede.

1411
01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.800
-I don't understand.
-His Dede.


1412
01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.000
-His what?
-His Dede.


1413
01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.240
-You already said that.
-Dede!


1414
01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.320
I don't understand.

1415
01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.600
His mom!

1416
01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:30.680
Of course.

1417
01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.400
We were actually missing the mother.

1418
01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.240
Still in Room 103,
still on the first floor.


1419
01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.240
Where, sorry?

1420
01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:40.960
Thank you.

1421
01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.840
Who's this? The third father?

1422
01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.280
How extended is this family?

1423
01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.400
What's happening?

1424
01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.560
Sit down, Tilly.

1425
01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.480
You should sit.

1426
01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.200
This is family business.

1427
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.360
You should sort it out among yourselves.

1428
01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.320
I don't want to know anything
about the… cocktail.


1429
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.400
-Bye.
-Bye.


1430
01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.840
Bye, Monica.

1431
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.840
Tilly,

1432
01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.200
can you explain this?

1433
01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.600
Leone's old enough. 
This is about him.

1434
01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.360
He should know.

1435
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.440
Please.

1436
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.280
Please, Tilly.

1437
01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.840
Tilly, get to the point!

1438
01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.280
Keep going.

1439
01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.600
My husband…

1440
01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.400
Divorce…

1441
01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.760
Leone…

1442
01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.400
I really don't know what to say.

1443
01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.600
-What'll we do now?
-I don't know.


1444
01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:29.560
I guess it'll also depend
on what Leroy says.


1445
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.120
What does Leroy have to say?
Who cares what Leroy says?


1446
01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.000
-No, of course.
-He's our son.


1447
01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.160
We raised him.

1448
01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:37.800
We raised you.

1449
01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:40.400
All right, Leone? 
You're our son.

1450
01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.600
So is it Leroy? Is it him?

1451
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.240
It isn't Leroy?

1452
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.520
Tilly, listen, please.
My head's spinning! Help us!


1453
01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.080
Please, let's finish this.
Help us, please!


1454
01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.640
Who's the father of our son?

1455
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.040
<i>I forgave Tilly.</i>

1456
01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.400
<i>We all forgave her.</i>

1457
01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.080
<i>None of us could
be truly angry with her.</i>

1458
01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.360
<i>After all,</i>

1459
01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:07.200
<i>if she hadn't had that moment</i>
<i>of weakness with her ex-husband,</i>


1460
01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.240
<i>I wouldn't be here
to tell you about it.</i>

1461
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:18.520
<i>And so, thanks to Dede, I now know</i>
<i>my biological father was Stephen…</i>


1462
01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.040
Easy!

1463
01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.720
<i>…though I'll never know him.</i>

1464
01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.200
<i>Tilly believes Stephen has returned</i>
<i>to being the invisible spirit</i>


1465
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.160
<i>he was before he was born</i>
<i>and now lights up the Milky Way.</i>


1466
01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.160
<i>I'll think of him</i>
<i>when I look at the night sky.</i>


1467
01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.440
<i>The problem, as usual, was what</i>
<i>the Italian law thought about it.</i>


1468
01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.400
<i>Fortunately, in certain special cases,</i>
<i>adoption can be requested.</i>


1469
01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.320
<i>And finally, the lawyer</i>
<i>managed to get both their names</i>


1470
01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.760
<i>on my birth certificate.</i>

1471
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.360
<i>And so, in the end,</i>

1472
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.240
<i>this strange family</i>
<i>of mine was made whole again.</i>


1473
01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.280
<i>Well, made whole in a manner of speaking.</i>

1474
01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.920
<i>Because in the end,</i>
<i>we were a family like any other,</i>


1475
01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:08.400
<i>and sometimes families explode.</i>

1476
01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:10.160
My life has changed a bit.

1477
01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.600
Now I have two houses.

1478
01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.120
I spend some nights
with Dad Simone and his partner,


1479
01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.800
others with Dad Paolo and…

1480
01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.800
No, it's just Paolo.

1481
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.280
They're no longer together,

1482
01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:27.880
but they love me the same as before,
and that's all I ask.


1483
01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.520
We had so many adventures together,

1484
01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.840
and we are
and will always be a family forever.


1485
01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.040
I wanted to tell the story
of my family and its disasters


1486
01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.280
because I would like the law
to take into account


1487
01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.360
that a birth

1488
01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.200
is the result of the complicity
of millions of people.


1489
01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.960
Men and women
connected by invisible threads,


1490
01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.080
threads that are a bit tangled too.

1491
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.800
But the protagonists of this story
are my parents,


1492
01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.200
my real parents,

1493
01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.000
Simone and Paolo.

1494
01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:18.680
Thank you…

1495
01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.800
for having welcomed me,

1496
01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.360
looked after me, and guided me in this

1497
01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:31.000
strange thing that is life.

1498
01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.400
Well done!

1499
01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:19.040
When does love end?

1500
01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.320
When you come home in the evening
and, finding his socks lying around,


1501
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.720
you no longer think he's distracted.

1502
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.440
You just want to strangle him
with those socks.


1503
01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.760
When you realize that…

1504
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.000
you no longer understand each other…

1505
01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:41.600
that you've taken two different paths.

1506
01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.440
But if love ends, was it really love?

1507
01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.920
It was love, yes,

1508
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.800
which can be transformed
into friendship at best,


1509
01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.400
resentment at worst.

1510
01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.520
If I'd never been born,
how would your life be different?


1511
01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.000
I don't even want to think about it!
What kind of questions are these?


1512
01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.040
Come on, Leone, without you… please!

1513
01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.600
It would have been
a joyless life, colorless.


1514
01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.880
A life in black and white.

1515
01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:11.320
And with him on my own? No way!

1516
01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.000
Did you turn that off? Turn it off.

1517
01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.080
Listen, Leone. Listen.

1518
01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.120
Your father and I probably
won't love each other like before,


1519
01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:27.160
but our love created you,

1520
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.200
a boy who's now here,
alive, in front of me,


1521
01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.600
and who deserves
all the love in the world.


1522
01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.400
Is that switched off?
