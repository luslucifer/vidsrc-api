1
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:09.779
Ah, Heidelberg!

2
00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.347
Oh, Sergeant!

3
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.382
Which is the quickest way
to Heidelberg, please?


4
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.283
- Uh, head down this street for four blocks.
- Uh-huh.


5
00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:51.753
You turn right. You go straight ahead
until you hit the autobahn.


6
00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:53.756
There are signs all the way.
You can't miss it.


7
00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.758
Thank you, Sergeant.

8
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.459
What have you decided?

9
00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:02.499
We don't know.

10
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:06.935
I know. Drive.

11
00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:55.911
"Captain Henri Rochard,
French Economic Mission."


12
00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.977
- Hey, Joe, we'll need you as interpreter.
- Never mind, Sergeant.


13
00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:00.853
- We'll get along all right.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Whom did you wish to see?


14
00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:05.793
The, uh, "O.I.C., A.M.G., W.A.C."

15
00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:08.330
Ah. First floor.
Turn to your right.


16
00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:10.332
Thank you, Sergeant.

17
00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:25.447
Hmm. War Administration
Industrial Relations...


18
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.449
Coordinator's Office.

19
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:33.350
Service of Supply Displaced Persons
Property Disposal Department.


20
00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:42.788
Uh, Labor Administration
Department...


21
00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.993
Inter... Inter...

22
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.167
I beg your pardon. I'm looking
for Lieutenant Gates's office.


23
00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:54.301
- Well, this isn't it.
- Isn't it?


24
00:04:54.378 --> 00:04:56.972
- Right over there, Captain.
- Thank you.


25
00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:06.752
<i>Yes, sir. Yes, Colonel.
Yes, sir.</i>


26
00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:09.257
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes...

27
00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:11.954
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?


28
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:16.591
Mm-hmm. One nightshirt. Gown.
What do you call this thing? Gown.


29
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.192
- Henri!
- One pair of bloomers...


30
00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:22.033
- two pairs of stockings...
and a run in one of them, I believe.
- Henri, please!


31
00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:24.596
Just a moment.
And one slip.


32
00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:26.939
I think that's all. I'm sorry
I couldn't get them to you any sooner.


33
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.069
Good-bye, Lieutenant Gates.

34
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.454
Oh, what a stinker you are.

35
00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:40.456
- Did I forget something?
- What a dirty stinker.


36
00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:42.458
And you're going right back
and explain...


37
00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:45.791
how you got my laundry by mistake
in DÃ¼sseldorf and forgot to give it back.


38
00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:48.160
Well, that's such a dull story.
Who would care?


39
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:51.689
- You know what you made them think.
- I don't quite understand...


40
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:55.135
Oh, no! You mean, you and me?

41
00:05:55.205 --> 00:05:58.299
Why, I'd be glad to explain to them. The
very idea of any connection is revolting.


42
00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:00.639
- Oh, no, you don't. Never mind. Just...
- I'd be delighted.


43
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.702
I'd explain to them
I think you're repulsive.


44
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.111
Shh! I said never mind.
Just forget it!


45
00:06:05.182 --> 00:06:07.343
Go away. You've had your joke.
Now beat it.


46
00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.647
Sorry, I can't oblige.
I'm here on official business.


47
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.813
- Oh, don't tell me. Another mission?
- Yes.


48
00:06:11.888 --> 00:06:14.652
- But don't get your hopes up.
You're not going with me.
- Thank heavens.


49
00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:19.856
- Who's your victim this time?
- My interpreter and aide is
a Lieutenant Eloise Billings...


50
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.421
- whom I'm reliably informed is intelligent...
- Yes.


51
00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:24.433
- Pretty...
- Yes.


52
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:26.435
And, as you Americans say, stacked.

53
00:06:26.503 --> 00:06:28.437
That she is.
You haven't met her?


54
00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:31.133
No. But that happy event's going to take
place in Major Prendergast's office...


55
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:33.301
in exactly, uh, 30 seconds.

56
00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:36.345
Good-bye again to you,
Lieutenant Gates.


57
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.515
- Where are you going?
- Major Prendergast's office.


58
00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:41.517
- There's nothing for you to do.
- Isn't there?


59
00:06:41.585 --> 00:06:43.246
- Wait. If you...
- I'm in a hurry.


60
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.550
- Hello, Eloise.
- Hi, honey.


61
00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:49.353
May I present Captain Rochard,
Lieutenant Billings.
You two are going to work together.


62
00:06:49.426 --> 00:06:51.986
- Enchanted, Lieutenant Billings.
- How do you do, Captain? I was just...


63
00:06:52.062 --> 00:06:53.996
I believe we have
a mutual friend, Alex Brissac.


64
00:06:54.064 --> 00:06:56.760
- How nice.
- Why, sure. I remember him.


65
00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.234
Lieutenant, due to the fact that I was on
previous missions with Captain Rochard...


66
00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:03.670
he just returned some of my things...
perhaps I can be of some help to you.


67
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.676
Thank you. I can explain things to Lieutenant Billings.
Don't you have somewhere to go?


68
00:07:07.744 --> 00:07:10.372
- Oh, no. I'm free until 2:30.
- Well, about this here mission...


69
00:07:10.447 --> 00:07:12.438
It's a simple matter.
It's an overnight job.


70
00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:15.110
We have to go to Bad Nauheim,
a pleasant little village, and...


71
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.153
- Or it will be till you get there.
- Oh.


72
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.861
Well, I can explain the whole thing
better to you when we're alone.


73
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.849
Better wear side arms, Lieutenant.
He uses maps instead of etchings.


74
00:07:23.927 --> 00:07:27.090
Captain Rochard, I've so looked forward
to going to Bad Nauheim.


75
00:07:27.164 --> 00:07:31.032
Billings, the French army shoe is
built on slightly different lines. It...


76
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:33.399
- Ooh.
- Hold the foot, would you, Junior?


77
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.169
- Yes, yes, yes.
- As you can see by Captain Rochard's
foot and my thigh.


78
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:40.903
- For goodness sakes!
- That was purely accidental.


79
00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:44.606
- The mark on my chin... May I have my foot?
- Mmm.


80
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:47.980
Thank you. The mark
under my chin was an accident.


81
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:51.418
- My fault entirely. I tripped
while he was chasing me.
- Chasing you?


82
00:07:51.488 --> 00:07:53.649
- Will you shut up?
- There. You see?


83
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.603
Something I would never have mentioned
if he hadn't shown it. His temper.


84
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.925
But the poor man's probably not to blame.
More like a form of epilepsy.


85
00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:02.260
- Will you shut up!
- I tell you this...


86
00:08:02.332 --> 00:08:04.266
Will you shh... shh...

87
00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:06.495
Henri, I'm talking.

88
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.504
Yes, you are.

89
00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:12.099
I tell you this because we're members
of the same army and the same sex.


90
00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:15.736
I think it only fair to warn you Jack the
Ripper's up that alley before you head into it.


91
00:08:15.812 --> 00:08:18.781
In case anything happens, would you like to
give me your mother's name and address?


92
00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:21.215
- But, honey, that's what I've
been tryin' to tell you.
- Oh?


93
00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:23.244
- I'm not goin' on this here mission.
- Tell me...


94
00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:26.585
- You're not?
- I'm goin' to Frankfurt with
Colonel Bliven on that D.P. Job.


95
00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:28.590
- But who...
- And you're goin' with him.


96
00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:31.126
- Tell me, who is Jack the...
- Oh.


97
00:08:31.194 --> 00:08:34.630
<i>Honey, maybe you'd better leave me
your mother's little old name and address.</i>


98
00:08:39.369 --> 00:08:41.303
- Oh, hello, Captain Rochard.
- Good morning, Major.


99
00:08:41.371 --> 00:08:45.364
I was just going to send for you, Gates.
Come in, please. You too, Captain.


100
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:52.111
This shouldn't take long, Captain. Gates,
Billings is needed on another assignment.


101
00:08:52.182 --> 00:08:55.310
- You'll have to take her place
along with Captain Rochard.
- Thank you, no.


102
00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:59.048
But, Major, if I may suggest, Lieutenant Perry
is almost finished with her assignment.


103
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:02.042
No. No experience. And Captain Rochard
wants our best, don't you, Captain?


104
00:09:02.092 --> 00:09:05.653
Well, uh, Major. You see,
this is not an important mission.


105
00:09:05.729 --> 00:09:08.857
My government's request for an officer
is only a technicality, so that...


106
00:09:08.932 --> 00:09:12.663
Your orders call for our full cooperation.
It's my job to see you get it.


107
00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:16.536
Now, here's your identity card, security
pass and temporary ration card.


108
00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:18.631
- Thank you.
- Your orders are being cut, Gates.


109
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:21.472
- Captain Rochard will brief you
on the mission.
- Yes, Major.


110
00:09:21.544 --> 00:09:25.605
Well, Major, this Lieutenant
What's-her-name... Perry, she ought to do.


111
00:09:25.682 --> 00:09:28.981
Oh, you're very kind, Captain,
but we're used to being shorthanded.


112
00:09:29.052 --> 00:09:34.080
Besides, if I remember, you've had several
assignments with Lieutenant Gates before...


113
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.523
and very successfully, apparently.

114
00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:41.895
It says here, "Recovered art treasures
stolen by the Nazis from the Lille Museum.


115
00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:46.231
"Also located hidden documents
relating to rocket research.


116
00:09:46.303 --> 00:09:48.601
Received Legion of Merit."

117
00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:51.266
- Ah, she's your man, all right.
- Wish she were.


118
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.639
- What was that you said, Captain?
- Oh, nothing, Major.


119
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.310
- Is there anything else I can do for you?
- No, thank you, Major.


120
00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:58.939
- You've done more than you realize.
- Good luck then.


121
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.109
- Good-bye, Major.
- Good-bye.


122
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.551
- Captain, Jack the Ripper was a famous...
- Thank you.


123
00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:11.787
Oh.

124
00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:13.795
Thank you, Captain.

125
00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.629
I wonder what the army would do
if I deserted.


126
00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:21.637
They'd shoot you.
The thought makes my mouth water.


127
00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:25.106
- I'd almost prefer it myself.
- Which way do we go?


128
00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:31.546
Well, let's get the briefing over.
What's the job?


129
00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:34.310
- You don't need to know.
- Oh, come on. Come on.


130
00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:36.318
What's the job?

131
00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:39.787
To keep your mouth shut
and do as I tell you.


132
00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:42.723
I would like to know the details
of my assignment in order to know...


133
00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.124
what equipment to draw
from the quartermaster.


134
00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:49.188
- See if they have a spare head.
- And I may as well warn you, bubble mouth...


135
00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:51.631
I'm going to carry a revolver
and a trench knife...


136
00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:53.896
and if you so much as lay
a finger on me this trip...


137
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.939
you're going back to France
minus a lot of parts you probably value.


138
00:10:57.007 --> 00:11:00.636
There you go again, you blistering idiot.
I didn't touch you!


139
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.838
Oh, I'm sorry, Henri, but we're stuck.
We've got to be together for a while...


140
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.847
so why not make the best of it?

141
00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:09.282
- There is no best.
- Well, I'll go crazy if you...


142
00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:14.051
We turn here. I'll go crazy if you keep
losing that maniac temper every ten minutes.


143
00:11:14.124 --> 00:11:17.821
Aw, Henri, let's grow up. I'm sorry
about what happened in the wine cellar.


144
00:11:17.894 --> 00:11:21.625
I have no temper. No one ever
accused me of having a temper!


145
00:11:21.698 --> 00:11:23.632
- They didn't, eh?
- No!


146
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.895
Do you remember what you were
doing the last time I saw you?


147
00:11:25.969 --> 00:11:28.494
You were chasing me down the Hermann
Goring Strasse in DÃ¼sseldorf...


148
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:31.335
swearing you were gonna
tear my head off and make me eat it!


149
00:11:31.408 --> 00:11:35.242
And what color was I? I was blue.
A lovely, robin's egg blue...


150
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:39.247
- You looked so funny!
- On account of having been pushed
into a vat of dye by you!


151
00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:42.113
- I didn't know it was dye.
I thought it was water.
- Water.


152
00:11:42.185 --> 00:11:45.120
Blue! All over. Blue.

153
00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:47.156
It's your own fault anyway...

154
00:11:47.223 --> 00:11:50.852
drinking all that free wine and turning
into an octopus with hands.


155
00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:54.454
You misunderstood. You flatter yourself.
I was only trying to be friendly.


156
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:56.999
Oh, I'm sorry I misunderstood.

157
00:11:57.067 --> 00:12:00.195
Well, let's forget it. It's all over with,
and the dye's come off.


158
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.204
- No, it hasn't!
- It hasn't?


159
00:12:02.272 --> 00:12:04.763
- No!
- Oh, I'm sorry.


160
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:08.538
Oh. That's all right. There's a certain
advantage in being an oddity.


161
00:12:08.611 --> 00:12:10.545
- In here, Henri.
- Oh.


162
00:12:15.552 --> 00:12:18.544
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Catherine. What's so funny?


163
00:12:18.621 --> 00:12:20.555
A little bit difficult to describe.

164
00:12:20.623 --> 00:12:23.057
Oh, Henri, this is Captain Ramsey.
Captain Rochard.


165
00:12:23.126 --> 00:12:25.086
- How do you do?
- Of the French Economic Mission.


166
00:12:25.128 --> 00:12:29.087
Oh!

167
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.099
- Hiya.
- Hiya.


168
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.965
- Have you some orders for me, Jack?
- All ready. Oh, Burns?


169
00:12:34.037 --> 00:12:36.972
You know, Cathy, this means
no dance for me Saturday night.


170
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.974
Don't be silly.
You can take Kitty.


171
00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:42.307
I'd rather sit alone in my room and
think of you. Wouldn't you, Captain?


172
00:12:42.378 --> 00:12:44.505
Uh-huh. Alone in my room.

173
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:47.641
- Better take good care of her.
- I'll watch her every moment.


174
00:12:47.717 --> 00:12:50.277
- Oh, that's fine.
- Well, we'd better be getting on.


175
00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.685
- Bye, Jack.
- How about dinner the night you get back?


176
00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:54.689
- Okay. It's a deal.
- Swell.


177
00:12:59.562 --> 00:13:01.427
See you in church.

178
00:13:01.498 --> 00:13:03.864
- Uh, sure. So long.
- So long.


179
00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:10.099
Hmmm. That, uh, linguist in there...

180
00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:12.300
I think he's stuck on you.
What's the matter with him?


181
00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:16.072
- It's only natural that you
wouldn't understand, Henri.
- It certainly is.


182
00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:20.879
You see, you chase after anything in skirts.
Anything. They're all the same to you.


183
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.885
But lots of men can tell them apart.

184
00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:28.219
Believe me, sometimes they find one they like
better than the others. That's called love.


185
00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:31.727
You probably haven't experienced it, but
you must have read about it somewhere.


186
00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:35.594
- Where are we going?
- We... I go that way. I have to get my stuff.


187
00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:38.930
- Which way do I go? I have to pay off my cab.
- I'll meet you at the motor pool.


188
00:13:39.002 --> 00:13:40.936
- When?
- Twenty minutes.


189
00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:45.304
Before you go, why did you say
I run after everything in skirts?


190
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:46.967
- I didn't.
- You did.


191
00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:49.910
- I said "anything."
- Oh, that's different then.


192
00:13:51.614 --> 00:13:54.105
American women.

193
00:13:54.184 --> 00:13:56.118
You know, I'm just beginning to get it.

194
00:13:56.186 --> 00:13:59.553
- For weeks you've been talking
as if he had yellow jaundice.
- He did.


195
00:13:59.622 --> 00:14:03.615
And now you're grinning like a
Cheshire cat because a job means
being with him for three days.


196
00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:06.127
- You can do a lot in three days.
- If you work at it.


197
00:14:06.196 --> 00:14:08.562
What about the dye?
Is it worn off, or is he still blue?


198
00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:11.623
He's still just mad,
but he's a lot of fun to fight with.


199
00:14:11.701 --> 00:14:14.670
- Bring that stuff, will ya?
- Sure.


200
00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:25.512
Are you, uh, ready, Captain?

201
00:14:25.582 --> 00:14:27.709
Quite ready, Lieutenant.

202
00:14:34.324 --> 00:14:36.258
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Oh. Morning, Lieutenant.


203
00:14:36.326 --> 00:14:38.419
Need transportation.
Going to Bad Nauheim.


204
00:14:38.494 --> 00:14:41.224
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess you're
all out of luck, Lieutenant.


205
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:45.256
- We'll settle for a jeep.
- All we got available are
motorcycles and sidecars.


206
00:14:45.335 --> 00:14:48.896
- Oh, come on, Sergeant!
- Did you look at your
travel orders, Lieutenant?


207
00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:52.908
- What about those cars?
- You got priority four, Captain,
and that's bottom.


208
00:14:53.076 --> 00:14:57.206
- Well, Captain, what do we do?
- We'll have to take a motorcycle.


209
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.044
- Are you checked out
on motorcycles, Captain?
- I can drive one.


210
00:15:00.116 --> 00:15:02.676
If you ain't checked out, you can't,
and I can't check you out.


211
00:15:02.752 --> 00:15:06.984
- I have a motorcycle license.
- Well, sir, I guess that fixes you up.


212
00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:10.423
- We'll wait for a car, Sergeant.
- Oh, I can drive one.


213
00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.656
- I'm sure.
- But I tell you I'm good on a motorcycle!


214
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.721
My brother had one.
We used to go hill climbing.


215
00:15:15.798 --> 00:15:18.733
- I can even ride one standing up.
- What for?


216
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:22.999
Oh, all right. But I can still ride
a motorcycle. Or are you afraid?


217
00:15:23.072 --> 00:15:27.202
We'll take it, Sergeant.
And I am afraid.


218
00:15:27.277 --> 00:15:30.110
- Any one of these, Sergeant?
- Sure, Lieutenant. Take your pick.


219
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.205
Remember, Captain, she has to drive it.
That's regulations.


220
00:15:33.283 --> 00:15:35.217
Thank you.

221
00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:41.250
Sergeant, can you dig up a helmet
and a pair of goggles?


222
00:15:41.324 --> 00:15:45.090
<i>- Should be some in the toolbox, Lieutenant.
- Oh. Yeah. Thanks.</i>


223
00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:49.625
What are you laughing about?

224
00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:53.157
Begging your pardon, Lieutenant, how do you
intend to ride that thing? Sidesaddle?


225
00:15:53.236 --> 00:15:56.171
No, Captain.
Begging your pardon, astride.


226
00:15:56.239 --> 00:15:58.173
- Oh, that's a shame.
- Excuse me.


227
00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:00.641
Mm-hmm.

228
00:16:08.518 --> 00:16:10.486
How far is it to Bad Nauheim?

229
00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:13.147
About 120 kilometers.

230
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:15.190
Do you know the way?

231
00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:17.726
- I've got a map.
- Of Germany?


232
00:16:17.794 --> 00:16:20.092
Yes, Captain.
That's right. Of Germany.


233
00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:21.824
Amazing.

234
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.006
Stop that. You'll be all right.

235
00:16:35.343 --> 00:16:37.140
Hey, Lieutenant!
You forgot something!


236
00:16:37.212 --> 00:16:40.204
Never mind. Just let her go!

237
00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:46.411
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I took it off for oiling.


238
00:16:46.487 --> 00:16:48.717
- I forgot to hook it up.
- That's all right.


239
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.315
You'd better take this one, Lieutenant.
It's all in one piece.


240
00:16:51.392 --> 00:16:54.987
- It would be better. Don't you agree, Captain?
- I don't know.


241
00:16:55.063 --> 00:16:58.294
- You don't know?
- Yes. I don't know.


242
00:17:00.134 --> 00:17:02.534
You know how silly you look
just sitting there?


243
00:17:10.712 --> 00:17:13.510
Well, is it still so funny?

244
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:15.572
No. I was just thinking.

245
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.347
I was thinking how nice it would be if
this one came off while we were driving.


246
00:18:30.425 --> 00:18:32.950
<i>Oh, Henri. I dropped my lipstick.</i>

247
00:18:33.027 --> 00:18:35.928
- It rolled over there.
- Get it, will ya?


248
00:18:35.997 --> 00:18:40.627
Well, it's a pleasure to get out
of this portable bathtub.


249
00:18:43.571 --> 00:18:47.302
- I can't reach it.
It's gone over there, you see?
- Well, climb over the top.


250
00:19:07.962 --> 00:19:10.760
<i>Hey.!</i>

251
00:19:10.832 --> 00:19:14.734
Hey! Let me down!
Let me down!


252
00:19:14.802 --> 00:19:17.100
Henri, what are you
doing up there?


253
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:44.254
- What's the deal, Lieutenant?
- The area's sealed off from here
to Battenberg, Lieutenant.


254
00:19:44.332 --> 00:19:47.699
- What for?
- Rounding up a gang of black market dealers.


255
00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:49.828
- I have a pass.
- I'm sorry. It's no good, Lieutenant.


256
00:19:49.904 --> 00:19:53.465
- And I've got a general pass.
- Keep it, Captain. All passes are suspended.


257
00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:56.772
- For how long?
- Oh, eight to 12 hours anyway. Maybe 24.


258
00:19:56.844 --> 00:19:59.438
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:59.514 --> 00:20:02.108
- Well?
- I might have known.


260
00:20:02.183 --> 00:20:05.084
Well, don't blame me.
It's not my fault. What'll we do?


261
00:20:05.153 --> 00:20:10.022
I can't wait here for 24 hours. I've got to
be in Bad Nauheim by 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.


262
00:20:10.091 --> 00:20:12.252
If this thing had wings, we could...

263
00:20:12.326 --> 00:20:15.386
- Say, what's wrong with that?
- Hmm? What's wrong with what?


264
00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:19.456
- That boat.
- I don't know. It should say
"U.S. Navy" on it, shouldn't it?


265
00:20:19.534 --> 00:20:23.300
Oh. I mean what's wrong with
putting the motorcycle on the
boat and rowing past Battenberg?


266
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:26.238
It's only a few miles,
and we can pick up the road from there.


267
00:20:26.307 --> 00:20:28.366
- Do you think they'd let us?
- Well, we can try.


268
00:20:28.443 --> 00:20:32.812
Hey, Lieutenant. Is it okay if we take
that boat and row down past Battenberg?


269
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.644
So long as you don't row on the road,
it's none of my business.


270
00:20:35.716 --> 00:20:37.775
- Good. Can we have a couple
of your boys to help us?
- Sure thing.


271
00:20:37.852 --> 00:20:40.878
- Thanks.
- Sergeant Christien, could you
bring some men over here?


272
00:20:40.955 --> 00:20:43.480
Watch your feet.
Better put it in gear, Corporal.


273
00:20:43.558 --> 00:20:46.584
Thanks, fellows.
Lieutenant, will you tell the O.I. C...


274
00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:49.653
that we'll either return the boat
or teletype him where to pick it up?


275
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.664
- Sure thing.
- Will you please help us to shove off?


276
00:20:51.732 --> 00:20:53.666
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.


277
00:20:53.734 --> 00:20:55.702
- Have a nice trip.
- Thanks.


278
00:20:56.871 --> 00:20:59.169
- Thank you. Grab an oar.
- Who, me?


279
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.902
Yes, you. An oar. Go on.

280
00:21:03.578 --> 00:21:06.741
Now, pull. Pull!

281
00:21:08.115 --> 00:21:10.049
Right. Pull.

282
00:21:21.028 --> 00:21:24.759
- What's that ahead?
- It's a bridge.


283
00:21:24.832 --> 00:21:27.630
- Not on the map though.
- Well, where are we?


284
00:21:27.702 --> 00:21:29.636
A couple of more miles should do it.

285
00:21:29.704 --> 00:21:31.638
- Ah.
- What's that?


286
00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:34.869
- What's what?
- That noise.


287
00:21:34.942 --> 00:21:40.141
- Sounds like a C-47.
- Oh, it's bigger than that. Must be a C-54.


288
00:21:40.214 --> 00:21:42.148
Must be an awful lot of C-47 s.

289
00:21:42.216 --> 00:21:44.184
C-54s.

290
00:21:49.724 --> 00:21:53.125
Well, whatever kind of airplanes
they are, they make a lot of noise.


291
00:21:53.194 --> 00:21:55.924
It doesn't sound like...
Henri, pull for shore, quick!


292
00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:57.965
- Why?
- Don't argue, please. Just pull!


293
00:21:58.032 --> 00:22:00.364
Oh, now let me tell you something,
Lieutenant Gates...


294
00:22:00.434 --> 00:22:02.459
I'm going straight down this river.

295
00:22:02.537 --> 00:22:05.301
You sure are. But you're going
over a waterfall first.


296
00:22:05.373 --> 00:22:07.739
Oh, well, that's different. I'm...

297
00:22:07.808 --> 00:22:10.368
Oh!

298
00:22:20.087 --> 00:22:22.055
Ooh!

299
00:22:22.123 --> 00:22:25.149
Oh, Henri, stop playing ostrich.
Come, help hold this!


300
00:22:25.226 --> 00:22:27.160
Hold on.

301
00:22:28.563 --> 00:22:32.363
- Now let's try to pull ourselves free.
- All right.


302
00:22:32.433 --> 00:22:35.869
- Come on, Henri. Pull. Pull hard.
- I'm pulling.


303
00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:39.668
Now we're getting it.

304
00:22:41.576 --> 00:22:44.807
- Now row.
- I'm rowing.


305
00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:46.813
Come on, Henri, pull!

306
00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:51.017
- Come on. Row hard, Henri.
- I am!


307
00:22:53.354 --> 00:22:56.118
- Now turn it around.
- I'll turn it.


308
00:22:57.458 --> 00:23:01.656
- Oh, boy!
- Oh! You're so clumsy.


309
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:08.101
Have you got it?

310
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:15.375
A little bit more.

311
00:23:24.151 --> 00:23:26.151
Henri, that's awfully wet ground
you're sitting on.


312
00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:29.156
Well, at the moment
I can't feel anything anyway.


313
00:23:29.223 --> 00:23:31.953
But when I do, I think
I'm going to kick you bowlegged.


314
00:23:32.026 --> 00:23:33.789
For what?
For saving your life?


315
00:23:33.861 --> 00:23:36.352
Oh, yes, that's right.
You did catch that rope, didn't you?


316
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.227
Yes. I did.

317
00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:40.995
- Convenient, wasn't it?
- Oh, they always are.


318
00:23:41.068 --> 00:23:44.003
Well, I suppose I owe you
something for that.


319
00:23:44.071 --> 00:23:47.199
Okay. I'll call it square if you'll tell me
what we're going to do in Bad Nauheim.


320
00:23:47.274 --> 00:23:49.208
- Oh.
- Come on, Henri.


321
00:23:49.276 --> 00:23:52.905
Well, there's a man in Bad Nauheim
who grinds lenses. Good ones too.


322
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.076
- His name is... What's the matter?
- Charley horse.


323
00:23:57.151 --> 00:23:59.176
Well, roll over.
I can fix that. I'm...


324
00:23:59.253 --> 00:24:02.484
- Oh, no. Never mind. Go ahead with the story.
- His name is Schindler.


325
00:24:02.556 --> 00:24:05.047
- Schindler, a lens grinder.
- That's right. My job is to persuade him...


326
00:24:05.126 --> 00:24:09.460
that we're willing to pay more
for his lenses than he can get
in the German black market.


327
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.731
- Ooh, that's sore.
- Well, do as I tell you. Roll over.


328
00:24:11.732 --> 00:24:14.030
- Come on. I'm good at that. Come on.
- Oh, all right.


329
00:24:14.101 --> 00:24:17.264
I'll fix it. I can help you.

330
00:24:17.338 --> 00:24:19.329
- What's our problem?
- No problem at all.


331
00:24:19.407 --> 00:24:23.537
A few well-chosen words, a contract, a
passport in his hand. Then we can go home.


332
00:24:23.611 --> 00:24:25.545
That's the whole plot.
Simple, isn't it?


333
00:24:25.613 --> 00:24:27.911
In that case, I don't see why
they assigned me to this mission.


334
00:24:27.982 --> 00:24:30.610
They probably didn't want
to make it too easy.


335
00:24:30.685 --> 00:24:32.619
- How is it?
- What?


336
00:24:32.687 --> 00:24:36.987
- My leg.
- Not bad. Better than I remembered.


337
00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:39.891
- Perhaps the other one needs...
- Oh, no. Never mind. That'll do it.


338
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.258
Thank you.
Help me up.


339
00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:45.999
I was just trying to be friendly.

340
00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:49.036
But you never try to be friendly
from a distance.


341
00:24:49.103 --> 00:24:53.437
Henri. Henri, one move, and this time it
won't be a vat of dye. It'll be the river.


342
00:24:53.507 --> 00:24:55.702
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.


343
00:24:56.777 --> 00:24:58.711
I think you would.

344
00:25:02.717 --> 00:25:05.447
Catherine, your lack
of cooperation is amazing.


345
00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:09.319
I'll cooperate by getting the map
and finding out where we are.


346
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.324
<i>Who put us on the river
in the first place?</i>


347
00:25:11.392 --> 00:25:14.486
I knew you were going to say that.
You're tiresome.


348
00:25:14.562 --> 00:25:17.998
You're subnormal. I don't propose
to argue with you any further.


349
00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:21.967
Oh, dear. That darn road doesn't
come within ten kilometers of here.


350
00:25:22.036 --> 00:25:24.436
What? Across open country
in that thing?


351
00:25:24.505 --> 00:25:26.905
Oh, it'll just be a little bumpy.
Only for a couple of hours.


352
00:25:26.907 --> 00:25:31.674
- We'll make it by 3:00.
- Ha. We won't get there before dark,
if we get there at all.


353
00:25:31.746 --> 00:25:35.079
This motorcycle will go anywhere.
If you'll get your pants off that grass...


354
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:37.947
and help me get it out of the boat,
we'll be on the road in no time.


355
00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:39.952
Pitch dark.

356
00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:07.740
Henri, we're lost. 
Absolutely lost.

357
00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:11.615
- Is there a difference?
- Oh, haven't you got a bump of direction?


358
00:26:11.685 --> 00:26:13.619
That's the only kind I haven't got.

359
00:26:13.687 --> 00:26:16.247
Well, come on. You drive this thing.
My back hurts. Oh!


360
00:26:16.323 --> 00:26:20.259
You're the one who checked out on the motorcycle.
You know what the sergeant said.


361
00:26:20.327 --> 00:26:23.490
<i>- Oh, stop being so cute.
I hate you when you're...</i>


362
00:26:23.564 --> 00:26:25.555
What's that? Listen.

363
00:26:33.874 --> 00:26:38.777
Oh! We must have been driving alongside
that road for the last hour!


364
00:26:38.846 --> 00:26:41.872
- Perhaps they just moved it there.
- Oh, shut up.


365
00:26:51.225 --> 00:26:54.160
Henri, there's a sign back there.
See what it says.


366
00:26:57.398 --> 00:27:00.765
- I don't suppose you have a flashlight.
- No, I haven't.


367
00:27:10.711 --> 00:27:13.077
- What does it say?
- I can't see.


368
00:27:13.147 --> 00:27:15.081
Well, climb up, silly.

369
00:27:16.984 --> 00:27:19.009
You'd better hurry up.
It's starting to rain.


370
00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:28.356
<i>- What does it say?
- Well, I can't tell. It's in German.</i>


371
00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:31.330
Well, move your arm.

372
00:27:31.398 --> 00:27:34.629
Oh. You can
come down now, Henri.


373
00:27:39.773 --> 00:27:41.798
- What did it say?
- Never mind. Get in.


374
00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:43.810
- But what did it say?
- "Wet paint."


375
00:27:43.878 --> 00:27:45.812
Well, how many miles?

376
00:27:46.881 --> 00:27:48.815
Oh, no, Henri.
No, you don't.


377
00:27:48.883 --> 00:27:51.317
You'll get awful wet if you stay out here.
Come on. Get in the sidecar.


378
00:27:51.385 --> 00:27:54.821
- I know it. I know it.
- Hurry up.


379
00:28:18.312 --> 00:28:20.439
All right, Henri.
We're in Bad Nauheim.


380
00:28:20.514 --> 00:28:23.176
<i>- You can come out now.
- You sure?</i>


381
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.947
Yes. I'm sure. 
And bring my bag.

382
00:28:37.097 --> 00:28:39.793
What are you talking about?

383
00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:41.926
He wanted to know
if we wanted one room or two.


384
00:28:42.002 --> 00:28:44.334
- You told him?
- I told him.


385
00:28:48.642 --> 00:28:51.406
What's the matter?

386
00:28:51.478 --> 00:28:53.912
My back. I think it's broken,
and it's all your fault.


387
00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:56.279
- My fault?
- Yes. If you'd pushed that cow out of the way...


388
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.784
we wouldn't have had to take
the detour that landed us in the brook.


389
00:28:58.852 --> 00:29:00.717
- It was a bull!
- Cow.


390
00:29:00.788 --> 00:29:03.723
You told me yourself you couldn't tell
the difference at 20 yards away.


391
00:29:03.791 --> 00:29:07.056
I know. But if you can't tell the difference
at 20 yards, it couldn't be a bull.


392
00:29:07.127 --> 00:29:10.187
- He would have had horns.
- Oh. Yeah.


393
00:29:18.973 --> 00:29:21.134
<i>- Who is it?
- Cinderella.</i>


394
00:29:21.208 --> 00:29:23.142
<i>- What do you want?
- My slipper.</i>


395
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.871
Well, open the door.

396
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:34.011
- Well, what do you want?
- You just said that. How's your back?


397
00:29:34.088 --> 00:29:36.113
Oh, it's awful. It hurts.

398
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.124
Get into bed.

399
00:29:38.192 --> 00:29:40.786
I will not get into bed.
What do you think you're doing?


400
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:43.455
- And what's all that stuff you've got there?
- I've brought you a drink.


401
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.431
Oh, I thought so. I knew
you'd get up to your old tricks.


402
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.298
And also some liniment
to rub your back. Get into bed.


403
00:29:53.207 --> 00:29:55.141
Oh.

404
00:29:55.209 --> 00:29:57.143
We'll need some water.

405
00:30:00.614 --> 00:30:03.048
Take your shirt off too.

406
00:30:03.117 --> 00:30:05.585
I am not going to
take my shirt off.


407
00:30:05.652 --> 00:30:07.916
Well, how am I going to
rub your back through your shirt?


408
00:30:07.988 --> 00:30:11.719
You're not going to rub my back through
anything, including my own foolishness.


409
00:30:11.792 --> 00:30:13.726
Here. Drink this.

410
00:30:16.697 --> 00:30:19.598
- Want some water?
- No. It's good.


411
00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:22.328
Hmm.

412
00:30:24.972 --> 00:30:28.635
My back!

413
00:30:28.709 --> 00:30:30.643
Do you want it rubbed or not?

414
00:30:30.711 --> 00:30:33.043
Is that stuff any good?

415
00:30:33.113 --> 00:30:35.047
Turn over.

416
00:30:35.115 --> 00:30:39.643
Wait a minute!

417
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.746
Go on. All right.

418
00:30:42.823 --> 00:30:45.758
Ow! Oh. Ooh!

419
00:30:45.826 --> 00:30:48.920
Stop bawling. I don't want them
to think we've smuggled a cow in here.


420
00:30:48.996 --> 00:30:52.090
- Well, it stings.
- That's what it's supposed to do.


421
00:30:52.166 --> 00:30:54.657
- Oh.
- Let it soak in for a while.


422
00:30:58.972 --> 00:31:00.837
Now, relax.

423
00:31:00.908 --> 00:31:03.274
Oh! You're dislocating everything!

424
00:31:03.343 --> 00:31:06.710
- Oh, relax.
- I hurt further up.


425
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.112
Well, how can I get you
to relax if you won't cooperate?


426
00:31:09.183 --> 00:31:12.641
- You heard what I said. I hurt further up.
- Oh.


427
00:31:17.257 --> 00:31:21.523
Mmm. That's better.
Makes me feel sleepy.


428
00:31:21.595 --> 00:31:23.256
Good.

429
00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:30.161
Oh, that's nice, Henri.

430
00:31:30.237 --> 00:31:35.675
You know, I'm sorry. I thought
when you came in here you were
behaving like a stinker.


431
00:31:35.742 --> 00:31:37.801
But you've been a stinker
for so long I just...


432
00:31:37.878 --> 00:31:40.312
I know. I know.
Go to sleep.


433
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.441
- What? With you in the room?
- Well, I can't rub you from the hallway.


434
00:31:48.021 --> 00:31:51.081
If I go to sleep, will you promise
to get right out of here?


435
00:31:51.158 --> 00:31:55.254
- I'll go now.
- Oh, no. It feels good.


436
00:31:55.329 --> 00:31:57.422
Now go to sleep,
and I'll be gone in a minute.


437
00:32:00.801 --> 00:32:03.497
Henri, about this mission.

438
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.700
<i>- Never mind.
- Well, I just want to ask a question.</i>


439
00:32:07.774 --> 00:32:12.234
- All right. What?
- Is this mission we're on so important?


440
00:32:12.312 --> 00:32:17.450
No. Not particularly. But it is to me, because
it's my last assignment for the army.


441
00:32:17.583 --> 00:32:19.312
I'm getting out next week.

442
00:32:19.385 --> 00:32:21.319
Oh. I didn't know that.

443
00:32:22.655 --> 00:32:26.386
<i>- Then it is important, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.</i>


444
00:32:29.962 --> 00:32:31.896
Henri, you know l...

445
00:32:33.332 --> 00:32:35.266
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

446
00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:54.919
Good night.

447
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.422
Oh, she'll never believe me.

448
00:38:07.733 --> 00:38:10.827
- What happened? What happened?
- Shh! You unspeakable weasel.


449
00:38:10.903 --> 00:38:13.371
I knew you'd be up to your old tricks
the minute my back was turned.


450
00:38:13.438 --> 00:38:15.372
- That's ridiculous.
- Get out of here.


451
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.374
- I can't get out.
- I said get out!


452
00:38:17.442 --> 00:38:19.376
- I can't get out.
- Shh. Why not?


453
00:38:19.444 --> 00:38:21.435
- Because the door handle came off.
- What an excuse!


454
00:38:21.513 --> 00:38:24.243
- Even you could think of a better one!
- The handle came off...


455
00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:27.183
- I don't believe you.
- You just try to open the door.


456
00:38:27.252 --> 00:38:29.186
- All right! I will.
- Open the door!


457
00:38:29.254 --> 00:38:31.620
<i>Try to open the door.</i>

458
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:34.591
L... How did you do that?

459
00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.788
Oh, you liar. You dirty...

460
00:38:39.164 --> 00:38:41.098
B
- B
-But...

461
00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:44.192
You're worse than I thought.
Put on your shoes and get out of here!


462
00:38:44.269 --> 00:38:46.237
- I tell you...
- Don't speak to me! Don't speak to me.


463
00:38:46.305 --> 00:38:49.297
You understand?
Don't speak to me again. Ever!


464
00:38:51.743 --> 00:38:53.677
Mmm.

465
00:39:02.588 --> 00:39:06.251
I don't want to talk to you.
Don't speak to me.


466
00:39:08.493 --> 00:39:10.757
<i>L...</i>

467
00:39:19.638 --> 00:39:22.232
Stop banging on that door!

468
00:39:29.448 --> 00:39:32.315
- You can't come in!
- I'm in!


469
00:39:33.518 --> 00:39:36.954
- Magic.
- I told you not to speak to me, and...


470
00:39:37.022 --> 00:39:38.956
<i>Someone's out there.</i>

471
00:39:39.024 --> 00:39:41.117
Good. Perhaps they'll let me out.

472
00:39:41.193 --> 00:39:43.252
Who is it?

473
00:39:43.328 --> 00:39:46.957
<i>Fraulein, it's me.
The innkeeper's wife.</i>


474
00:39:47.032 --> 00:39:50.627
Henri, we gotta do something. You...

475
00:39:50.702 --> 00:39:52.795
- I know. Get out that window.
- Who, me?


476
00:39:52.871 --> 00:39:55.704
Go on, Henri. You can't
be found in here. Don't argue.


477
00:39:55.774 --> 00:39:58.800
- Oh! American women!
- Go on.


478
00:40:03.615 --> 00:40:06.448
What the...

479
00:40:06.518 --> 00:40:09.180
Oh, shoot.

480
00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:16.493
Come in.

481
00:40:20.198 --> 00:40:24.635
<i>The Klinke... The door handle came off.
It happened before once in the night.</i>


482
00:40:24.703 --> 00:40:27.365
I put it back.
I'm very sorry it happened.


483
00:40:42.521 --> 00:40:46.924
Climbing in
the nice young lady's room! Out here!


484
00:40:46.992 --> 00:40:48.687
- No, no, no!
- Out here!


485
00:40:50.729 --> 00:40:52.890
<i>Henri!</i>

486
00:41:04.977 --> 00:41:06.911
<i>Come in.</i>

487
00:41:06.979 --> 00:41:10.574
Oh, excuse me.
I was looking for Captain Ro...


488
00:41:10.649 --> 00:41:12.947
Oh, Henri! No!

489
00:41:13.018 --> 00:41:15.646
What do you want?

490
00:41:15.721 --> 00:41:17.655
You look like an organ grinder.

491
00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:25.459
- What was that?
- The innkeeper. I borrowed his clothes.


492
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.657
Why?

493
00:41:27.733 --> 00:41:30.896
I came here to Bad Nauheim
to find Herr Schindler.


494
00:41:30.969 --> 00:41:32.994
So I'm gonna make the rounds
of the black market hangouts...


495
00:41:33.071 --> 00:41:35.631
and see if I can get
some information about him.


496
00:41:35.707 --> 00:41:39.108
If I'm in uniform, no one's gonna
tell me anything. Is that reasonable?


497
00:41:39.177 --> 00:41:41.475
- Yes.
- See you later.


498
00:41:41.546 --> 00:41:43.673
- Don't you want me to help you?
- No.


499
00:41:43.749 --> 00:41:45.683
Oh, now, Henri.

500
00:41:45.751 --> 00:41:50.848
I'm sorry about the door handle. I was wrong.
You were telling the truth. I'm really sorry.


501
00:41:50.922 --> 00:41:53.117
Nice of you to apologize.
That fixes everything.


502
00:41:53.191 --> 00:41:56.217
- Well, what more can I do?
- I often wonder.


503
00:41:56.294 --> 00:41:59.161
Oh, Henri. Stop being like that.
You're behaving like a little boy.


504
00:41:59.231 --> 00:42:02.064
- I know it.
- But you said it was important.
I just want to help.


505
00:42:02.134 --> 00:42:05.865
- Never mind.
- Is it all right if I go on
my own and try to find Schindler?


506
00:42:05.937 --> 00:42:08.735
- Shh!
- Well, maybe I could do something.


507
00:42:08.807 --> 00:42:11.776
- Don't do anything.
- Oh, you make me so mad.
You don't want me to help.


508
00:42:11.843 --> 00:42:14.903
That's right. Don't do anything. If you see
me, don't speak to me. You don't know me.


509
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.710
- Why not?
- Because you're an American
officer in uniform.


510
00:42:17.783 --> 00:42:19.910
If I'm seen talking to you,
they'll think I'm a stool pigeon.


511
00:42:19.985 --> 00:42:22.818
- I don't see why I can't go out...
- Please. Just take orders.


512
00:42:22.888 --> 00:42:25.322
- Now remember. You don't know me.
- I don't know you.


513
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.358
- You can't speak to me.
- Okay. I can't speak to you.


514
00:42:27.426 --> 00:42:30.862
- You can't even see me.
- I never could. Not for sour apples.


515
00:42:30.929 --> 00:42:34.057
- Oh!
- Oh, you stubborn...


516
00:42:36.101 --> 00:42:37.162
He makes me so mad I could...

517
00:42:37.197 --> 00:42:38.357
He makes me so mad I could...

518
00:42:41.173 --> 00:42:43.266
Hey, Catherine.
Catherine Gates!


519
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:45.775
Jowitt! Hello. How are you?
It's good to see you.


520
00:42:45.844 --> 00:42:48.472
- What are you doing in Bad Nauheim?
- I'm here on a mission.


521
00:42:48.547 --> 00:42:51.308
- What sort?
- Well, I'll tell you about it.
Can we get breakfast here?


522
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:53.317
- I know where we can get some real coffee.
- Where is it?


523
00:42:53.385 --> 00:42:56.912
- Come on. Gonna be here long?
- Oh, just for a couple of days.


524
00:42:56.988 --> 00:42:58.649
Fine.

525
00:43:01.326 --> 00:43:04.591
Here we are. Bill Trumble,
Catherine Gates.


526
00:43:04.663 --> 00:43:07.325
- Hello. How are you?
- Glad to meet you, Lieutenant.
Won't you sit down?


527
00:43:07.399 --> 00:43:10.027
- Thanks.
- Catherine just got in town this morning.


528
00:43:10.102 --> 00:43:13.230
- Good morning. Do you want
anything besides coffee?


529
00:43:13.305 --> 00:43:16.240
- Oh, jam, rolls. Anything you have.
- Make it for two.


530
00:43:16.308 --> 00:43:18.799
How long are you going to be here?

531
00:43:18.877 --> 00:43:21.778
- Just a couple of days.
- You haven't told me what you're doing here.


532
00:43:21.847 --> 00:43:24.782
Well, it's not much
of a story. Just...


533
00:43:28.587 --> 00:43:32.990
- Say, isn't that the fellow I
saw you talking to at the inn?
- Yes. That's him.


534
00:43:33.058 --> 00:43:36.858
Well, he's going into the wrong place.
That's a black market hangout.


535
00:43:36.928 --> 00:43:39.021
Bill has a friend in the M.P.s.

536
00:43:39.097 --> 00:43:41.031
The German police are gonna raid
that place this morning.


537
00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:43.294
You mean the place
he just went into?


538
00:43:43.368 --> 00:43:45.802
Mm-hmm. That's why
we came here for breakfast.


539
00:43:45.871 --> 00:43:47.805
Get a floor show thrown in free.

540
00:43:47.873 --> 00:43:51.240
<i>Well, you couldn't have
chosen a better spot.</i>


541
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:55.609
Here they are now.
Watch them operate.


542
00:44:18.503 --> 00:44:20.596
<i>Hey, Sergeant,
will you come and help me?</i>


543
00:44:20.672 --> 00:44:24.335
Constable! Halt, halt!

544
00:44:24.409 --> 00:44:26.673
There's someone who can identify me.
She's an officer in the United States Army.


545
00:44:26.745 --> 00:44:29.145
Come with me here. Catherine.

546
00:44:29.214 --> 00:44:32.214
Catherine, tell these men who I am.
Identify me. Please tell them something.


547
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.445
- Is something wrong, Officer?
- If you please, Lieutenant.


548
00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:37.113
He says he is French officer
and you know him.


549
00:44:37.189 --> 00:44:39.157
I never saw him before in my life.

550
00:44:39.224 --> 00:44:43.422
- That's what I thought!
- You shouldn't have done this
to me, Catherine!


551
00:44:43.495 --> 00:44:45.486
I'll get even! 
I'll get even!

552
00:44:48.066 --> 00:44:50.534
I'll get even, traitor! 
I'll get even!

553
00:44:52.504 --> 00:44:56.668
- Catherine, what is going on here?
- I'll tell you later.


554
00:44:56.741 --> 00:45:00.939
Look. By any chance could you fellows help me
find a German lens grinder named Schindler?


555
00:45:01.012 --> 00:45:03.207
- Sure.
- We ought to be able to help you on that.


556
00:45:03.281 --> 00:45:05.215
- Think so?
- Mm-hmm.


557
00:45:13.692 --> 00:45:15.853
- Is this the man?
- Yes. That's Captain Rochard.


558
00:45:15.927 --> 00:45:18.361
- Good morning, Henri.
- I trust the captain will understand.


559
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:22.600
There was nothing else we could do. No identity card.
It was not really our fault.


560
00:45:22.733 --> 00:45:25.793
Don't worry. I'm entirely
aware whose fault it was.


561
00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:27.962
Henri, I did exactly as you told me.

562
00:45:28.038 --> 00:45:30.233
Well, thank you, Captain.
Thank you.


563
00:45:30.307 --> 00:45:34.505
- One question. Why have you
no beds in this jail?
- Didn't you have a bed, Henri?


564
00:45:34.578 --> 00:45:38.776
Well, you see, Captain, when we had beds,
everyone wished to be arrested.


565
00:45:38.849 --> 00:45:42.683
It was terrible. The people did anything... everything...
just so they could have a bed.


566
00:45:42.753 --> 00:45:45.881
- I know how they felt.
- Oh, you poor dear.
You haven't had a wink of sleep.


567
00:45:45.956 --> 00:45:48.857
Shut up. May I go now?

568
00:45:48.926 --> 00:45:51.394
- Yes. Of course, Captain.
- Thank you very much.


569
00:45:51.462 --> 00:45:53.589
I'd like to have a word or two
with you outside.


570
00:45:53.664 --> 00:45:56.827
- Of course, Henri. I want to talk to you too.
- Mm-hmm.


571
00:45:59.436 --> 00:46:01.563
Now, before you say anything,
I want you to meet...


572
00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:04.039
Listen, you little bug-eyed traitor,
I want you to remember this.


573
00:46:04.108 --> 00:46:06.042
I'll get even. 
I swear I will.

574
00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.874
I'll get even if it takes years.
If it takes forever, I'll get even.


575
00:46:08.946 --> 00:46:11.073
- Please. Captain Rochard.
- Go away. I'm busy.


576
00:46:11.148 --> 00:46:13.776
- I'll break you. I'll break you like a dry twig.
- Henri, this is...


577
00:46:13.851 --> 00:46:18.049
I'll turn you into a shaking old woman with
a tin... Didn't you hear me say I was busy?


578
00:46:18.122 --> 00:46:20.556
- With a tin cup!
- I'm trying to tell you this is...


579
00:46:20.624 --> 00:46:24.890
While I can understand how you
can be an utter rat just for the
fun of it, one thing baffles me.


580
00:46:24.962 --> 00:46:27.430
- Oh, there's no pleasing some people.
- And that's your job.


581
00:46:27.498 --> 00:46:31.229
The army gave you an assignment. You took
an oath as an officer... the oath of duty.


582
00:46:31.301 --> 00:46:34.600
- I just followed your orders.
- Now we'll never find Schindler!
Where is Schindler now?


583
00:46:34.672 --> 00:46:37.505
- Well, he's right...
- He's probably heard
I've been looking for him...


584
00:46:37.574 --> 00:46:40.475
and he's gone underground... maybe left the country...
I know how those fellows work!


585
00:46:40.544 --> 00:46:42.478
- But, Henri...
- What do you want? Who are you?


586
00:46:42.546 --> 00:46:46.505
- I am Schindler.
- Well, that's fine.
Will you please stop annoying...


587
00:46:46.583 --> 00:46:48.517
- You're Schindler?
- Yeah. Schindler.


588
00:46:48.585 --> 00:46:52.453
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- Because you wouldn't give
anybody a chance to say a word.


589
00:46:52.523 --> 00:46:56.164
Now if you'll button that big lip of yours so
Herr Schindler can talk to you for a minute...


590
00:46:56.193 --> 00:46:58.127
he hasn't much time
before his train leaves.


591
00:46:58.195 --> 00:47:03.462
Yeah. All I wanted to say is that I'm so glad...
so grateful, so full of happiness. Thank you.


592
00:47:03.534 --> 00:47:05.468
- Well...
- Good-bye.


593
00:47:05.536 --> 00:47:07.470
- Wait! I want to talk to you.
- He'll miss his train.


594
00:47:07.538 --> 00:47:10.268
Yes. I go to Paris.
French Economic Bureau.


595
00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:13.434
I've got my passport and documents
and contract here in my pocket.


596
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.944
- I took them out of your briefcase.
- This wonderful young lady...


597
00:47:16.013 --> 00:47:18.277
- is giving and telling me everything.
- Mm-hmm.


598
00:47:18.348 --> 00:47:21.909
So I leave Germany now.

599
00:47:21.985 --> 00:47:24.510
I never wanted to be
in the black market.


600
00:47:24.588 --> 00:47:30.424
I'm a scientist, and now I will work
for science and for France...


601
00:47:30.494 --> 00:47:33.986
and no more like
a thief in the night.


602
00:47:34.064 --> 00:47:37.192
Thank you.
Thank you.


603
00:47:37.267 --> 00:47:39.201
Good-bye.

604
00:47:41.071 --> 00:47:43.505
Thank you again. Good-bye.

605
00:47:44.575 --> 00:47:47.442
Nice little guy.

606
00:47:47.511 --> 00:47:49.445
Mmm.

607
00:47:59.089 --> 00:48:01.557
- So you found him.
- I ran smack into him.


608
00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:05.789
Someone I knew knew him.
He was very anxious to go, as you heard.


609
00:48:05.863 --> 00:48:09.458
- It was easy.
- Yeah. Easy.


610
00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:11.194
Yeah. Easy.

611
00:48:34.925 --> 00:48:37.723
All right. Go ahead.
Start hollering. Call me names.


612
00:48:41.532 --> 00:48:44.933
Just a minute. 
Do you speak English?

613
00:48:45.002 --> 00:48:50.304
- Sure!
- Good. You know, there's nothing
I've ever really wanted in life.


614
00:48:50.374 --> 00:48:53.002
Fame, money, position... nothing.

615
00:48:53.076 --> 00:48:56.204
Nothing until now.
There's just one thing.


616
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.147
And that is never to see you
again as long as I live.


617
00:48:59.216 --> 00:49:02.151
That was a mean, rotten thing
to say, and l...


618
00:49:02.219 --> 00:49:04.619
Will you get the coffee, please?

619
00:49:04.688 --> 00:49:09.387
- That was mean rotten.
- Maybe it was mean rotten,
but it wasn't accidental.


620
00:49:09.459 --> 00:49:11.586
Fortunately, I'm getting
out of the army soon.


621
00:49:11.662 --> 00:49:15.962
I'm going to be a civilian, so never again
can they order me to associate with you.


622
00:49:16.033 --> 00:49:18.797
What's more, I'm going back
to Heidelberg by train.


623
00:49:18.869 --> 00:49:22.771
You can get some other chump to torture
in that lunatic sidecar of yours.


624
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.970
Aw, Henri, I know why you're mad,
and I don't blame you. I would be too.


625
00:49:27.044 --> 00:49:30.172
I knew it was your last job
in the army, and I just didn't think.


626
00:49:30.247 --> 00:49:34.183
I spoiled it for you. I'd give anything
if I hadn't. I'd cut off my arm, almost.


627
00:49:34.251 --> 00:49:37.379
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I like you, Henri. I can't help it. I do.


628
00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:40.355
You're stubborn, and you don't know
anything, and you're a fathead.


629
00:49:40.424 --> 00:49:44.326
But I don't want you to go away and just
disappear without saying you'll write...


630
00:49:44.394 --> 00:49:47.158
or kick me or use my toothbrush...

631
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:49.472
- Oh, for heaven's...
- Well, I wouldn't put it past you!


632
00:49:49.499 --> 00:49:52.627
- And after all we've been to each other.
- And all we haven't been.


633
00:49:52.703 --> 00:49:54.694
- And all we've done together.
- And all...


634
00:49:54.771 --> 00:49:58.366
All we haven't done together.
I know that's not your fault.


635
00:49:58.442 --> 00:50:00.876
It's all mine, and I feel like a...

636
00:50:00.944 --> 00:50:06.007
Oh, I'm making a fool of myself. Now,
get outta here, or say something nice!


637
00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:08.984
Oh. Well, I don't know, Catherine. L...

638
00:50:09.052 --> 00:50:12.647
Oh, that was nice, Henri.
That was nice. Please say more.


639
00:50:15.025 --> 00:50:17.721
Well, if we're gonna get back to Heidelberg
before dark, we'd better be going.


640
00:50:17.794 --> 00:50:20.422
- Oh, Henri!
- But, Catherine...


641
00:50:20.497 --> 00:50:22.431
- Yes, Henri?
- Just one thing.


642
00:50:22.499 --> 00:50:24.831
- What?
- Pay for the coffee.


643
00:50:24.902 --> 00:50:26.836
Yes, Henri.

644
00:50:49.226 --> 00:50:51.160
What happened?
What happened?


645
00:50:51.228 --> 00:50:55.597
Well, you went to sleep,
so I pulled off the side of the road.


646
00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:58.032
- I thought this would be better.
- Thank you.


647
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:01.502
You know, Henri, I've been thinking.
Why do we fight all the time?


648
00:51:01.571 --> 00:51:05.132
- You tell me.
- Oh, just sex antagonism, I guess.


649
00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:07.369
- What does that mean?
- I don't know exactly...


650
00:51:07.444 --> 00:51:10.311
but I think it means just the opposite
of what it sounds like.


651
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.110
- I can't even think what it sounds like.
- Oh, Henri.


652
00:51:13.183 --> 00:51:16.175
I think it means that we really
like each other but won't admit it.


653
00:51:16.253 --> 00:51:19.950
Listen. I'd like it distinctly
understood that l...


654
00:51:20.023 --> 00:51:23.356
- If I weren't so sleepy...
- Don't do it. Go to sleep.


655
00:51:23.427 --> 00:51:25.361
I will.

656
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.205
- You all right?
- Sure. Go on back to sleep.


657
00:51:45.282 --> 00:51:48.911
- Why are we stopping?
- I want to see a man about a road.
I'll be back in a minute.


658
00:51:48.986 --> 00:51:50.920
Take your time.

659
00:52:14.711 --> 00:52:17.612
Henri! Henri!

660
00:52:17.681 --> 00:52:20.343
You know something, Catherine?

661
00:52:20.417 --> 00:52:23.045
I don't mind being
the first one to say it.


662
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.714
I like you very much.

663
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:28.553
As a matter of fact,
I'd miss you if you weren't here.


664
00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:31.093
Henri, stop!

665
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:33.823
Come back! Henri!

666
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.598
Oh, no.

667
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.946
- Henri!
- Catherine, now that I've
told you how I feel, l...


668
00:52:54.017 --> 00:52:56.110
Oh! My, this is terribly bumpy.

669
00:52:57.387 --> 00:52:59.321
Look out!

670
00:53:03.293 --> 00:53:05.557
<i>Catherine.! 
Catherine.!</i>

671
00:53:05.629 --> 00:53:07.790
<i>Catherine, darling.!
Are you all right? Where are you?</i>


672
00:53:07.864 --> 00:53:09.798
Yes. I'm here. I'm coming!

673
00:53:15.605 --> 00:53:17.835
<i>I can hear you,
but I can't find you.!</i>


674
00:53:17.908 --> 00:53:19.842
Darling, are you all right?
Where are you?


675
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.037
Here I am, over here.

676
00:53:23.113 --> 00:53:25.343
Oh, there you are.

677
00:53:25.415 --> 00:53:30.375
Oh, darling. Thank goodness you're safe.
How did you get out there?


678
00:53:31.855 --> 00:53:35.018
Well... Wait a minute. Ooh.

679
00:53:35.092 --> 00:53:37.720
I'm all out of breath
from chasing you.


680
00:53:37.794 --> 00:53:39.989
- From chasing me?
- Uh-huh.


681
00:53:40.063 --> 00:53:43.260
- You mean you weren't on the motorcycle?
- Uh-uh. You were by yourself.


682
00:53:43.333 --> 00:53:46.427
- Oh. You got off and left me.
- Henri.


683
00:53:46.503 --> 00:53:48.437
- Huh?
- What's all this "darling" business...


684
00:53:48.505 --> 00:53:50.632
you were mumbling about
a moment ago?


685
00:53:50.707 --> 00:53:53.608
- Darling? Did I say that?
- I heard you.


686
00:53:53.677 --> 00:53:55.736
It's probably fright.
It's only natural that...


687
00:53:55.812 --> 00:53:57.871
Did you mean me, Henri?

688
00:53:57.948 --> 00:54:00.781
Uh, I think I was
stunned momentarily.


689
00:54:00.851 --> 00:54:04.844
Well, maybe you were, but you looked like
you were going to kiss me when you saw me.


690
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:08.982
- I what?
- I wish you had. I've never
been kissed by a Frenchman.


691
00:54:09.059 --> 00:54:12.256
Well, there's not...
What's so strange about that?


692
00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:14.388
Oh, you know what people say.

693
00:54:14.464 --> 00:54:17.627
- Oh, that's nonsense.
- Well, you just hear people talk.


694
00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:19.760
We're no different
than anybody else.


695
00:54:19.836 --> 00:54:23.067
- Well, I don't know. I've just heard talk.
- That's silly.


696
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.200
Why don't you try it just once,
and let me see?


697
00:54:26.276 --> 00:54:29.211
- Oh, Catherine!
- That's the only way to find out, isn't it?


698
00:54:29.279 --> 00:54:33.238
- But I tell you, it's so silly.
- Well, there's no harm in trying, is there?


699
00:54:33.316 --> 00:54:36.649
- No. I suppose not.
- Well, all right. Go ahead.


700
00:54:37.954 --> 00:54:40.388
- Hmm. Well, are you ready?
- Sure.


701
00:54:45.929 --> 00:54:49.126
- There. You see?
- That was no good. That wasn't
the least bit different.


702
00:54:49.199 --> 00:54:51.565
I told you it wasn't going
to be any different.


703
00:54:51.635 --> 00:54:54.832
But I thought it'd be better than that.

704
00:54:54.905 --> 00:54:57.373
Well, after all, you didn't
give me much of a chance.


705
00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.360
- Oh, that wasn't fair, was it?
- What do you expect? Of course it wasn't.


706
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:02.810
- I really should give you another chance.
- Yes, you ought.


707
00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:05.109
Well, all right.
Go ahead. Try again.


708
00:55:05.182 --> 00:55:07.673
All right.

709
00:55:07.751 --> 00:55:09.685
Here. Come here.

710
00:55:14.224 --> 00:55:17.159
Well! That was a little better.

711
00:55:17.227 --> 00:55:20.856
Certainly. You see? It could have been
even better if I'd had some cooperation.


712
00:55:20.931 --> 00:55:23.365
If I'd had a French girl,
it would have been fine.


713
00:55:23.433 --> 00:55:25.560
Wait. What did you mean
by that remark?


714
00:55:25.635 --> 00:55:28.832
Well, you haven't been
giving me much help.


715
00:55:28.905 --> 00:55:31.499
- Oh. And you think a French
girl could do better?
- Yes. I do.


716
00:55:31.575 --> 00:55:33.634
- Do you want to try it again?
- Do you want to try it again?


717
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:37.612
- Yes.
- Well, so do I.


718
00:55:37.681 --> 00:55:41.310
Wait a minute. Lean back.
Are you comfortable?


719
00:55:41.384 --> 00:55:43.318
- Yes.
- Good.


720
00:55:44.788 --> 00:55:47.484
Major, we... we want to get married.

721
00:55:47.557 --> 00:55:50.117
Well! When did you reach
that decision?


722
00:55:50.193 --> 00:55:52.991
- This afternoon, about 2:30.
- In a haystack.


723
00:55:53.063 --> 00:55:55.293
You see, Henri was
on the motorcycle, and l...


724
00:55:55.365 --> 00:55:57.833
Catherine, I don't think the major
would be interested in all the details.


725
00:55:57.901 --> 00:56:00.461
And you two didn't want
to go away together.


726
00:56:00.537 --> 00:56:03.097
It would seem your mission
was very successful.


727
00:56:03.173 --> 00:56:05.232
- Thank you, Major.
- My congratulations.


728
00:56:05.308 --> 00:56:08.004
- You're the very first to know.
- I guessed as much.


729
00:56:08.078 --> 00:56:10.273
Now, as to getting married,
there's one hitch.


730
00:56:10.347 --> 00:56:12.577
- Itch?
- It's probably the haystack. Henri and l...


731
00:56:12.649 --> 00:56:14.844
- I don't... I don't...
- I said "hitch."


732
00:56:14.918 --> 00:56:18.285
All marriages between American
military personnel and aliens...


733
00:56:18.355 --> 00:56:20.355
- and you come under that heading, Captain...
- Ah.


734
00:56:20.423 --> 00:56:22.550
Must be approved
by the commanding general.


735
00:56:22.626 --> 00:56:24.821
- Now, there's a set procedure
for that kind of thing.
- Yes, but...


736
00:56:24.894 --> 00:56:27.522
- It's only red tape, Henri.
- Well, do you itch, Catherine?


737
00:56:27.597 --> 00:56:31.192
The major said "hitch," Henri. She means
we've got to get a lot of things approved.


738
00:56:31.268 --> 00:56:33.600
- Oh.
- Here are the forms
requesting permission to marry.


739
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:35.604
Fill them out in quadruplicate...

740
00:56:35.672 --> 00:56:37.970
and when you've completed them,
send them to Colonel Bliven's office.


741
00:56:38.041 --> 00:56:40.373
- Yes, Major.
- And good luck.


742
00:56:42.746 --> 00:56:45.374
- Good-bye, Captain.
- Yes.


743
00:56:48.852 --> 00:56:52.413
- Is she always so confusing?
- No. But this is going to be.


744
00:56:52.489 --> 00:56:54.787
- What's the matter?
- Look at all this stuff we've got to fill out.


745
00:56:54.858 --> 00:56:59.227
- She said there was four of them.
- You weren't hearing so good.
She said four of each.


746
00:56:59.296 --> 00:57:01.161
- Let's go and get to work.
- Fine.


747
00:57:01.231 --> 00:57:03.358
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

748
00:57:06.636 --> 00:57:09.867
- Souvenir.
- You'll end up with a pocketful.


749
00:57:14.544 --> 00:57:17.274
Well, this is impossible.

750
00:57:17.347 --> 00:57:19.474
Don't give up now.
We're halfway through.


751
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:22.575
My uncle's politics, aunt's religion,
any warts, any...


752
00:57:22.652 --> 00:57:26.418
By the way, my aunt's name is Fanny.
Would you put that down, please?


753
00:57:26.489 --> 00:57:30.084
Any identifying scars
on my second cousin's clavicle?


754
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.859
We'll never get this done. And look at this
silly thing. "Name your father's gender."


755
00:57:34.931 --> 00:57:37.832
- No.
- Yeah. It says so. Look.


756
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:41.735
No. "Father's birthplace."
Gender belongs to this question over here.


757
00:57:41.805 --> 00:57:44.638
- I thought there was something wrong.
- What an idiot.


758
00:57:44.708 --> 00:57:47.973
- Were you ever captured by Peruvian Indians?
- No. Why?


759
00:57:48.044 --> 00:57:51.013
I understand they do a very good job
of shrinking heads.


760
00:57:51.081 --> 00:57:53.743
Mmm. Come on.

761
00:57:53.817 --> 00:57:56.251
Come on. Let's take time out.

762
00:57:59.022 --> 00:58:02.822
Oh, there are a lot of things
I'd rather do than answer questions.


763
00:58:02.892 --> 00:58:06.293
- This, for instance?
- Mm-hmm.


764
00:58:08.064 --> 00:58:10.760
Maybe I'd better go back
and see another double feature.


765
00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:12.901
<i>Oh, no. Come on in.</i>

766
00:58:13.034 --> 00:58:15.127
We're still filling out forms.

767
00:58:15.203 --> 00:58:18.138
If you find anyone who wants
to fill out forms with me, let me know.


768
00:58:18.206 --> 00:58:20.140
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- Good night.


769
00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:22.142
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.


770
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:24.576
- We gotta get busy.
- Oh.


771
00:58:24.646 --> 00:58:26.944
Why do we have
to go through all this?


772
00:58:27.015 --> 00:58:30.178
It's the army's way of finding out
if you really want to get married.


773
00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:32.685
- Well, I know a much better way.
- Henri.


774
00:59:33.881 --> 00:59:36.714
Major Prendergast. Yes.

775
00:59:36.784 --> 00:59:40.720
At ease, Gates.
That'll be all right. Well, Gates?


776
00:59:40.788 --> 00:59:45.225
I'm sorry to bother you, Major, but we
haven't heard a word about our application.


777
00:59:45.293 --> 00:59:48.751
- It's been over a week.
- Your papers must've
bogged down somewhere.


778
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:50.855
Isn't there something you can do
to hurry them up?


779
00:59:50.932 --> 00:59:53.298
He's getting awfully nervous,
and so am I.


780
00:59:53.368 --> 00:59:57.327
- I'll see what I can do. I'll let you know.
- Thank you, Major.


781
00:59:57.405 --> 00:59:59.339
- Oh, Gates.
- Yes, Major?


782
00:59:59.407 --> 01:00:02.808
<i>- He is worth waiting for, isn't he?
- Well, he is now.</i>


783
01:00:02.877 --> 01:00:06.210
I don't know what he'll be like
by the time I get him.


784
01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:21.352
I can't understand an American
marrying a foreigner she hardly knows.


785
01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:23.363
It's ridiculous and disgraceful.

786
01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:27.595
- I just can't see why she wants to.
- You all better get glasses.


787
01:00:27.668 --> 01:00:31.160
<i>Why are you women such pushovers for
this parlez vous hand kissing stuff?</i>


788
01:00:31.239 --> 01:00:33.867
Hand kissing?
Why, he does more than that.


789
01:00:33.941 --> 01:00:36.171
Why, Catherine told me
he was plumb crazy.


790
01:00:36.244 --> 01:00:38.712
Always chasing her
and trying to beat her up.


791
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.374
Why, he left marks
all over her. I saw 'em.


792
01:00:41.449 --> 01:00:45.351
- Leave marks on me any time.
I'll bring the stick.
- Oh, it wasn't a stick.


793
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.820
- He kicked her right in the...
- What?


794
01:00:47.889 --> 01:00:49.914
- Well, he did.
- Hi, Catherine.


795
01:00:49.991 --> 01:00:52.391
- We were just talking about you, honey.
- I'll bet you were.


796
01:00:56.197 --> 01:00:58.188
Oh.

797
01:01:00.234 --> 01:01:02.464
Well, say something.
Did you see her?


798
01:01:02.537 --> 01:01:06.200
- Don't lose your temper.
The papers are stuck somewhere.
- Stuck, how?


799
01:01:06.274 --> 01:01:08.765
Well, bogged down in channels,
lying on someone's desk.


800
01:01:08.843 --> 01:01:11.710
- What for?
- Henri, please. I don't know.


801
01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:14.714
Well, they let other people get married.
What have they got against you?


802
01:01:14.782 --> 01:01:17.342
Against me? It's probably you
they're investigating.


803
01:01:17.418 --> 01:01:19.443
- Nonsense. Why should they?
- Henri, please.


804
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.148
- There are other people in the room.
- Why should they investigate me?


805
01:01:22.223 --> 01:01:24.987
Because the American army
is very careful. That's why.


806
01:01:25.059 --> 01:01:28.324
American army had better be careful,
or they're not gonna have any
American children soon.


807
01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:31.160
- Will you kindly lower your voice?
- I'll do better than that.


808
01:01:31.232 --> 01:01:33.166
I'll take it somewhere else
if it annoys you.


809
01:01:33.234 --> 01:01:35.600
Do that, and while you're about it,
go bag your oars.


810
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:38.366
- "Bag your oars"?
What's that, more army talk?
- Navy.


811
01:01:38.439 --> 01:01:40.600
Oh, naval talk.
It sounds like it. Charming.


812
01:01:40.675 --> 01:01:42.870
- You make me sick.
- Good.


813
01:01:42.944 --> 01:01:44.935
Henri.

814
01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:50.207
Excuse me.

815
01:01:52.687 --> 01:01:55.747
Catherine, let me ask you something
like a brother.


816
01:01:55.823 --> 01:01:58.553
- Do you really wanna marry that phony joker?
- Certainly not.


817
01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:01.618
- You're kidding.
- I hope he chokes. Slowly, very slowly.


818
01:02:01.696 --> 01:02:05.962
That's what I said all along. A girl like you...
you couldn't make a mistake like that.


819
01:02:06.033 --> 01:02:09.867
- Thank heavens for army red tape.
- Oh, don't thank the army.


820
01:02:09.937 --> 01:02:12.030
- You can thank me personally.
- You? Why?


821
01:02:12.106 --> 01:02:15.041
I hid the papers. I knew it was
a cinch you'd change your mind.


822
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:18.101
- You hid the papers?
- That's right. I knew I was doing you a favor.


823
01:02:18.179 --> 01:02:20.647
- You hid the papers.
- I put them in the advance file.


824
01:02:20.715 --> 01:02:24.811
Don't mind going out on a limb for a friend.
It was taking a chance, sure...


825
01:02:40.134 --> 01:02:43.763
Now as to your marriage, you, Catherine,
want me to marry you in my church.


826
01:02:43.838 --> 01:02:46.306
- That's right.
- And you, Henri, always promised...


827
01:02:46.374 --> 01:02:48.501
the pastor of your parish
that he'd do the job.


828
01:02:48.576 --> 01:02:50.908
- Yes.
- I think you'd better have both marriages.


829
01:02:50.978 --> 01:02:53.276
- I think he's right.
- Oh, yes, yes.


830
01:02:53.347 --> 01:02:55.474
Just a moment.
There's more to it than that.


831
01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:59.213
Under the German law, which is
recognized by the occupying army...


832
01:02:59.287 --> 01:03:02.415
you have to go through a civil ceremony
before the church ceremony.


833
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:04.822
- Oh?
- So you have to be married first...


834
01:03:04.892 --> 01:03:07.520
<i>- by the bÃ¼rgermeister here in Heidelberg...
- Ah.</i>


835
01:03:07.595 --> 01:03:10.086
And then come to me,
and then go to Henri's pastor.


836
01:03:10.164 --> 01:03:12.860
- That makes three times.
- Three?


837
01:03:12.934 --> 01:03:16.461
Chaplain, did you know that in China,
the bride and groom just drink tea...


838
01:03:16.537 --> 01:03:19.700
- out of the same bowl, and that's it?
- Are you Chinese, Henri?


839
01:03:19.774 --> 01:03:22.538
- Of course I'm not Chinese.
- I didn't think you were. I'm not.


840
01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:25.135
- What brought that up?
- You just said something about drinking tea.


841
01:03:25.213 --> 01:03:28.512
- I was telling the chaplain...
- I'll drink tea with you if you want me to.


842
01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:31.746
- You do?
- Stop it. Stop it.


843
01:03:31.819 --> 01:03:35.152
- Chaplain, perhaps I shouldn't
go through with this.
- You can still say no, Henri.


844
01:03:35.223 --> 01:03:38.750
<i>- We'll go to the bÃ¼rgermeister,
and then come back to you.
- I'll be ready for you any time.</i>


845
01:03:38.826 --> 01:03:41.351
- Thank you.
- Don't pay any attention to her, Chaplain.


846
01:03:41.429 --> 01:03:43.454
- All right.
- Good-bye.


847
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:46.500
<i>- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.</i>


848
01:03:55.643 --> 01:03:58.874
You have decided now
to live your future life together.


849
01:04:07.788 --> 01:04:09.722
And forsaking all other...

850
01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:13.988
keep thee only unto him
so long as ye both shall live?


851
01:04:14.061 --> 01:04:17.030
- I will.
- Will you please join right hands?


852
01:04:19.734 --> 01:04:22.669
Henri, will you repeat after me?

853
01:04:22.737 --> 01:04:25.103
- I, Henri...
- I, Henri...


854
01:04:25.172 --> 01:04:27.640
- take thee, Catherine...
- Take thee, Catherine...


855
01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:29.835
to be my wedded wife.

856
01:04:45.793 --> 01:04:48.990
- He wants the ring.
- I haven't got it.


857
01:04:49.063 --> 01:04:51.122
Oh, here. L...

858
01:05:32.306 --> 01:05:34.604
Well, you like it?

859
01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:38.005
I like it.

860
01:05:42.149 --> 01:05:44.208
It's been quite a day, hasn't it?

861
01:05:44.285 --> 01:05:47.015
We're a lot married,
Henri, three times.


862
01:05:47.088 --> 01:05:49.215
It was worth it.

863
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:53.423
I don't see how we could
ever get a divorce.


864
01:05:53.494 --> 01:05:57.191
It would be something like unwinding
the inside of a golf ball.


865
01:05:57.264 --> 01:06:00.756
- Want some more coffee?
- I just had four cups.


866
01:06:00.835 --> 01:06:03.895
- Besides, it keeps me awake.
- Oh.


867
01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:09.809
What's the matter?

868
01:06:09.877 --> 01:06:12.471
I was just thinking about a friend
of mine on his wedding night.


869
01:06:12.546 --> 01:06:14.480
Oh? What happened?

870
01:06:14.548 --> 01:06:18.644
<i>Well, you see, he was a...</i>

871
01:06:34.735 --> 01:06:39.365
No, no. Not tonight. No, no. No, no.

872
01:06:47.948 --> 01:06:50.075
- Tell me about him.
- About what?


873
01:06:50.151 --> 01:06:52.085
About your friend
on his wedding night.


874
01:06:52.153 --> 01:06:54.280
Oh. I'm not so sure
I can tell you that.


875
01:06:54.355 --> 01:06:57.756
- Oh, of course you can, Henri.
- That's right. I can now, can't I?


876
01:06:57.825 --> 01:07:00.089
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, here's what happened...


877
01:07:04.465 --> 01:07:07.059
This is just like my friend's story.

878
01:07:14.909 --> 01:07:16.843
- Now what?
- Hi. Can I come in?


879
01:07:16.911 --> 01:07:19.607
- Well, you're in.
- I didn't wanna come, but I have to...


880
01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.671
<i>- Then go away.
- But...</i>


881
01:07:21.749 --> 01:07:24.616
Kitty, what on earth are you doing here?
I thought you'd gone back.


882
01:07:24.685 --> 01:07:27.153
Of all the times to...
Well, what do you want, anyway?


883
01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:29.655
- Well, I certainly didn't wanna come here.
- Then go away.


884
01:07:29.723 --> 01:07:32.055
I've got something to tell you first,
and you're not going to like it.


885
01:07:32.126 --> 01:07:34.185
- What is it?
- I've just been on the phone.


886
01:07:34.261 --> 01:07:36.982
The colonel gave orders you're
to leave for Heidelberg in 20 minutes.


887
01:07:37.031 --> 01:07:40.660
- You're kidding.
- The whole outfit's been alerted
to go back to America.


888
01:07:40.734 --> 01:07:43.601
- To America? Well, they're
not going right away.
- Well, I don't know.


889
01:07:43.671 --> 01:07:45.605
Then we don't have
to leave tonight.


890
01:07:45.673 --> 01:07:47.868
Maybe you don't, but Catherine does.
Those are orders.


891
01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:50.240
- When do I have to report?
- Not until morning.


892
01:07:50.311 --> 01:07:52.911
Then we stay here tonight, and fly back
and report in the morning.


893
01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.813
- Orders.
- You could tell the colonel
you couldn't find us.


894
01:07:55.883 --> 01:07:59.011
He beat you to it. He said if I tried
to pull that one, we'd both be sorry.


895
01:07:59.086 --> 01:08:00.951
- Oh!
- Cathy, I'm in a spot. So are you.


896
01:08:01.021 --> 01:08:04.980
You've got to get working on Henri's passport,
or he won't be able to sail with you.


897
01:08:05.059 --> 01:08:07.186
Henri, we're dead.

898
01:08:07.261 --> 01:08:09.456
Well, this is a fine wedding night!

899
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.556
You can find a place to stay
in Heidelberg. It's better than nothing.


900
01:08:12.633 --> 01:08:16.535
- What do you mean, nothing?
- You better start packing.
You've only got 20 minutes.


901
01:08:16.604 --> 01:08:20.506
- How do we get back from here?
- Plane to Frankfurt. There'll be a jeep there.


902
01:08:20.574 --> 01:08:24.704
- See you later.
- Orders are I'm to stick with you
until you get to Heidelberg.


903
01:08:24.778 --> 01:08:27.542
- Orders.
- Orders? Uh...


904
01:08:29.116 --> 01:08:32.085
Orders.

905
01:08:32.152 --> 01:08:35.121
They wouldn't do this
in the French army.


906
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:37.180
Poor Henri.

907
01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.271
- Uh-oh. Want me to wait for you?
- What do you mean, wait?


908
01:08:56.343 --> 01:08:59.312
- What, all night?
- I don't think it's going to be that long.


909
01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:03.316
Uh... What kind of trouble
are you dreaming up now?


910
01:09:03.384 --> 01:09:06.148
I just noticed where you're going.
It says "B.O. Q"


911
01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.780
- Oh, no.
- That means bachelor
officers' quarters, Henri.


912
01:09:08.856 --> 01:09:13.122
I don't care what it means.
That is where I live, and that's
where I'm going to take my wife.


913
01:09:13.193 --> 01:09:15.127
But it's against regulations.

914
01:09:15.195 --> 01:09:17.959
Who cares anything about regulations
at a time like this?


915
01:09:18.032 --> 01:09:22.025
Besides, I know the sergeant
on the desk, and he always looks the...


916
01:09:23.504 --> 01:09:26.132
He's a very nice fellow.
Comes from Tulsa, Oklahoma.


917
01:09:26.206 --> 01:09:29.073
Driver, please take Lieutenant
Lawrence home. Good night, Kitty.


918
01:09:29.143 --> 01:09:31.077
- Good night, Henri.
- Come along, Catherine.


919
01:09:31.145 --> 01:09:32.840
- But, Henri, l...
- Now, please.


920
01:09:32.913 --> 01:09:34.904
- Good night, Kitty.
- Good night, Catherine.


921
01:09:34.982 --> 01:09:38.179
- Hope it works.
- Leave it to me.


922
01:09:50.096 --> 01:09:52.030
- It's just us, Kitty.
- Shh!


923
01:09:52.098 --> 01:09:55.499
- B.O. Q means bachelor officers' quarters.
- I told you it did...


924
01:09:55.568 --> 01:09:58.264
And after that, we went to six hotels.
They're all against...


925
01:09:58.338 --> 01:10:01.136
No military personnel...
What's the matter with you?


926
01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:04.176
Billings is on the couch, and Thompson
and Kay are in the bedroom.


927
01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:06.108
- What are they doing here?
- Sleeping.


928
01:10:06.179 --> 01:10:08.238
- Oh, no.
- Come on, Catherine.


929
01:10:08.314 --> 01:10:11.283
- Where, Henri?
- I don't know, but since
the beginning of the world...


930
01:10:11.351 --> 01:10:14.946
man has always found a place
for his mate, even if it was a cave.


931
01:10:15.021 --> 01:10:17.285
Well, tonight mankind's a flop.

932
01:10:17.357 --> 01:10:20.485
You haven't got a cave.
You haven't even got a bed.


933
01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.893
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and it's my wedding night...


934
01:10:23.963 --> 01:10:27.455
and my feet hurt,
and I couldn't walk another step.


935
01:10:27.533 --> 01:10:30.400
Yes, darling, yes.
Well, do you want to sleep here?


936
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:34.930
No. I mean, yes, but I want you
to sleep here too.


937
01:10:35.008 --> 01:10:38.808
Well, you can bunk up with me,
and he can sleep in the bathroom.


938
01:10:38.878 --> 01:10:40.971
- Sitting up?
- It's not so bad.


939
01:10:41.047 --> 01:10:44.175
- I slept in a bathtub once.
- On your wedding night?


940
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:48.311
No. I'll get you some blankets
and a pillow.


941
01:10:48.388 --> 01:10:51.585
Come along.

942
01:10:51.657 --> 01:10:54.217
Oh, Henri, how could it
turn out like this?


943
01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:56.523
I'd always planned us
to have a wonderful...


944
01:10:56.596 --> 01:10:58.587
I know. I know, darling.
Come on.


945
01:11:10.843 --> 01:11:13.835
There's the bathroom there.

946
01:11:13.913 --> 01:11:15.938
Good night, Henri.

947
01:11:16.015 --> 01:11:19.849
- Here's your pillow and blankets.
- Good night, dear. Good night.


948
01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:24.421
Oh, everything's wrong.

949
01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:28.551
Now I can't wear my new nightgown.
There isn't even any rice...


950
01:11:28.628 --> 01:11:31.825
- Maybe Kitty has some mothballs.
- Good night, Henri.


951
01:11:31.898 --> 01:11:33.798
I don't think it's funny,
not a bit...


952
01:11:33.866 --> 01:11:36.266
with me in one room
and you in a bathtub.


953
01:11:36.336 --> 01:11:40.067
Yes, dear.
Well, never mind.


954
01:11:40.139 --> 01:11:42.073
- Good night, darling.
- Yeah, good night.


955
01:11:42.141 --> 01:11:44.075
And don't cry.
I'll be all right.


956
01:11:44.143 --> 01:11:46.407
I'll be quite comfortable.

957
01:11:46.479 --> 01:11:49.141
I'll just turn on the cold water.

958
01:12:27.919 --> 01:12:29.853
Hmm.

959
01:12:35.494 --> 01:12:38.793
Oh, come on, Henri. Hurry up.
We've got a lot of things to do.


960
01:12:38.864 --> 01:12:41.890
<i>I am hurrying,
just as fast as I can go.</i>


961
01:12:41.967 --> 01:12:44.197
Well, straighten up.
You look like a question mark.


962
01:12:44.269 --> 01:12:46.737
- Oh! Thank you.
- There. That's better.


963
01:12:46.805 --> 01:12:49.672
What a place to put a faucet.

964
01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:51.675
- Where?
- In the middle of my back.


965
01:12:51.743 --> 01:12:53.904
It is unusual.
Well, cheer up, dear.


966
01:12:53.979 --> 01:12:55.970
At least tonight
you'll have a bed to sleep on.


967
01:12:56.048 --> 01:12:59.677
Well, that's just it.
Catherine, I don't mean to sound cranky...


968
01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:02.743
but this situation is so unnatural.

969
01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:05.153
I'll be at B.O.Q. And you'll be
sleeping miles away...


970
01:13:05.223 --> 01:13:07.157
all because
the United States Army...


971
01:13:07.225 --> 01:13:09.159
We haven't got time
to look for another place today.


972
01:13:09.227 --> 01:13:11.627
We've got to see
the American consul. Come on, silly.


973
01:13:11.697 --> 01:13:16.532
- What are you doing in the gutter?
- Where else would I be?


974
01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:19.866
Now, I know it's very important
and you're in a hurry...


975
01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:21.963
but it's not gonna be easy.

976
01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.806
Take the matter of support. Captain, have
you any money in the United States?


977
01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:28.277
- No.
- And the laws of your country...


978
01:13:28.347 --> 01:13:31.111
forbid you taking anything
but a nominal amount with you.


979
01:13:31.183 --> 01:13:33.117
Yes, I'm afraid that's right.

980
01:13:33.185 --> 01:13:35.676
Then a visitor's visa
would do you no good.


981
01:13:35.754 --> 01:13:39.121
You couldn't take a job.
And unless your wife can prove...


982
01:13:39.191 --> 01:13:42.718
that she's able to support you,
you couldn't get a permanent visa.


983
01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:46.560
Catherine isn't going to support me,
so is there any other kind of visa?


984
01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.565
What about the French quota?

985
01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:51.124
The French quota's completely
filled up for this year and next.


986
01:13:51.203 --> 01:13:53.501
- Well, what'll we do?
- I was wondering...


987
01:13:53.572 --> 01:13:57.008
if public law 271 would apply.

988
01:13:57.075 --> 01:13:59.942
That's the one regulating
the immigration of war brides.


989
01:14:00.011 --> 01:14:02.980
Catherine doesn't have to immigrate.
She's an American citizen.


990
01:14:03.048 --> 01:14:05.414
I was thinking of you as the bride.

991
01:14:05.484 --> 01:14:09.352
That's a pretty good
imagination you have there.


992
01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:12.185
It says spouses.
Doesn't mention sex.


993
01:14:12.257 --> 01:14:14.953
I'm convinced the American army
doesn't believe in it.


994
01:14:15.026 --> 01:14:18.518
This is gonna work.
Yes, I think this is gonna work.


995
01:14:18.597 --> 01:14:21.464
- Well, sure, it will. Say, this is wonderful.
- What's so wonderful?


996
01:14:21.533 --> 01:14:24.764
It says spouses means mates.
Doesn't say anything about male or female.


997
01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:27.828
- We're mates, aren't we?
- I really wouldn't know.


998
01:14:27.906 --> 01:14:31.171
You're a spouse of a member
of the American expedition forces.


999
01:14:31.243 --> 01:14:33.211
Therefore, you're eligible to travel...

1000
01:14:33.278 --> 01:14:38.181
- under section 271 as her bride.
- As her bride?


1001
01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.184
- No, Henri, please.
- As your bride?


1002
01:14:40.252 --> 01:14:42.212
- Oh, Henri, it'll be fun.
- But isn't it ridic...


1003
01:14:42.254 --> 01:14:45.382
Of course it is, darling, but it'll work.
You'll see. It's the only way.


1004
01:14:45.457 --> 01:14:47.584
Here's the application right here.

1005
01:14:47.659 --> 01:14:51.959
I am not going to travel as her bride.
And besides, her name's Rochard.


1006
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:56.023
Excuse me, Captain Rochard,
but officially, it's still Gates.


1007
01:14:56.101 --> 01:14:58.729
Not at all.
Officially, it is Rochard.


1008
01:14:58.804 --> 01:15:01.568
- I have three wedding certificates to prove it.
- Henri.


1009
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.631
I don't care.
Rochard. Rochard.


1010
01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.836
Pay no attention to him, Mr. Jones.
What do we have to do?


1011
01:15:06.912 --> 01:15:10.814
Here you fill out your name, rank,
organization, your wife's maiden name.


1012
01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:13.783
- She hasn't got a wife.
- Just for the time being.


1013
01:15:13.852 --> 01:15:16.980
- Have you got a wife?
- No, dear. But it's only a piece of paper.


1014
01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:19.421
- Well, then you...
- Well, obviously these applications...


1015
01:15:19.491 --> 01:15:21.755
are intended for
the husband to fill in.


1016
01:15:21.827 --> 01:15:23.590
Oh, well, I can write.
I can write.


1017
01:15:23.662 --> 01:15:27.359
- Yes, we know, dear. You can write.
- No, this doesn't apply to you.


1018
01:15:27.432 --> 01:15:29.593
You'll just have to make
the proper adjustments.


1019
01:15:29.668 --> 01:15:31.898
- What?
- On these papers.


1020
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:33.961
- You want to go, don't you?
- What?


1021
01:15:34.039 --> 01:15:36.007
I tell you, Henri,
it's the only way.


1022
01:15:36.074 --> 01:15:38.804
Just hand those over to the immigration
officer when you've filled them out.


1023
01:15:38.877 --> 01:15:40.811
- Thank you, Mr. Jones.
- But, Catherine...


1024
01:15:40.879 --> 01:15:42.813
It'll be simple. You'll see.

1025
01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:45.850
On the contrary, the process
of turning a man into a woman...


1026
01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:48.909
<i>is enormously complicated.</i>

1027
01:15:48.987 --> 01:15:52.753
- But I'll do my best. Thank you. Good day.
- Good day.


1028
01:15:52.824 --> 01:15:54.416
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.


1029
01:15:54.493 --> 01:15:56.552
Just a moment.
Brides first, please.


1030
01:15:56.628 --> 01:15:59.392
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- That's all right.


1031
01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:08.872
Hello, Henri.

1032
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:12.000
- Well, nothing happened.
- Hasn't it come yet?


1033
01:16:12.077 --> 01:16:14.011
I wonder if the application
even arrived.


1034
01:16:14.079 --> 01:16:17.708
I handed it to the immigration officer
myself first thing this morning.


1035
01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:20.444
Henri, brace yourself. I'm leaving.

1036
01:16:20.519 --> 01:16:24.182
- Our whole outfit leaves tonight.
- Tonight?


1037
01:16:24.256 --> 01:16:26.190
Oh, well, that does it.
We're cooked.


1038
01:16:26.258 --> 01:16:30.319
- The application will come
this afternoon. It's got to.
- It won't. Oh, you'll see.


1039
01:16:30.395 --> 01:16:33.296
You'll go, and I'll sit here
wondering which sex I am.


1040
01:16:33.365 --> 01:16:36.232
What a marriage. Solitary confinement.
Separate rooms.


1041
01:16:36.301 --> 01:16:38.235
I've never been
so lonely in my life.


1042
01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:41.272
- If I have to leave you, I'll shoot myself.
- Shoot me too. I'm...


1043
01:16:41.339 --> 01:16:44.638
- I think this is it. It came to the office.
- Thank you, Kitty.


1044
01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.747
At last.

1045
01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:54.012
"Dear madame"?
Oh, yes, that's me.


1046
01:16:54.085 --> 01:16:56.883
"Following application
of your husband..." that's you...


1047
01:16:56.955 --> 01:16:59.355
"you are informed that permission
to enter the United States...


1048
01:16:59.424 --> 01:17:01.654
as a war bride has been granted."

1049
01:17:01.726 --> 01:17:03.660
- I gotta get back. I'll see you later.
- Thanks, Kitty.


1050
01:17:03.728 --> 01:17:07.129
- I'm so happy. Kiss me.
- We've got time now. That can wait.


1051
01:17:07.198 --> 01:17:11.191
- Or maybe it can't.
- Oh, no, darling. No, no, Henri.
Please, the letter.


1052
01:17:11.269 --> 01:17:14.705
"Please fill in attached form
and bring to this..."


1053
01:17:14.773 --> 01:17:18.106
Another form.
Will they ever run out of forms?


1054
01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:20.610
Hmm. Hmm.

1055
01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.710
I won't. I won't answer
those questions.


1056
01:17:24.783 --> 01:17:28.685
- Oh. Well, Henri, this isn't so bad.
- I won't answer those questions.


1057
01:17:28.753 --> 01:17:30.687
- You've got to.
- I won't!


1058
01:17:30.755 --> 01:17:32.689
- You don't wanna stay, do you?
- No.


1059
01:17:32.757 --> 01:17:34.691
- Then you've got to answer them.
- How can I?


1060
01:17:34.759 --> 01:17:37.557
You can, Henri, and perhaps the man
at the office will help you.


1061
01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:40.291
- It wouldn't be possible.
- Now, please, control yourself
for once and be nice.


1062
01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:42.629
- How can you answer a single...
- Everything will be all right.


1063
01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:45.898
Be sure and read them over on the
way down. Good-bye, Henri. Good luck.


1064
01:17:46.271 --> 01:17:49.672
<i>- I tell you, there isn't another form.
- I told you first.</i>


1065
01:17:49.741 --> 01:17:52.676
<i>- This form isn't for a man. It's for a woman.
- Uh-huh.</i>


1066
01:17:52.744 --> 01:17:56.305
On the other hand, if you don't get this
form filled out and approved, you can't go.


1067
01:17:56.381 --> 01:18:00.044
- That's right.
- You mean I've got to use this form?


1068
01:18:00.118 --> 01:18:01.949
Sergeant,
I felt the same way you do...


1069
01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:05.956
but if that's the only form,
come on, let's fill it out.


1070
01:18:06.024 --> 01:18:10.017
Well, let's see. Age and birthplace.
We've got all that.


1071
01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:12.495
Well, here's the first one.

1072
01:18:12.564 --> 01:18:14.532
Are you an expectant mother?

1073
01:18:14.599 --> 01:18:17.329
Uh-huh.

1074
01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:20.701
Yes. How many months?

1075
01:18:20.772 --> 01:18:23.002
Twenty.

1076
01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:26.976
Twenty. Twenty months.

1077
01:18:27.045 --> 01:18:30.537
Any... Any female trouble?

1078
01:18:30.615 --> 01:18:34.051
Nothing but, Sergeant.

1079
01:18:35.387 --> 01:18:39.448
And... have you ever had
any children before?


1080
01:18:39.524 --> 01:18:43.255
Oh, my aching back. You know
that awful feeling before breakfast?


1081
01:18:43.328 --> 01:18:45.728
- No, Captain, I don't.
- Oh, Sergeant, you're lucky.


1082
01:18:45.797 --> 01:18:47.697
Captain, this doesn't make any sense.

1083
01:18:47.766 --> 01:18:50.735
I know, but come on. We gotta
fill it out. Ask me another.


1084
01:18:50.802 --> 01:18:53.100
There's some good ones coming up.

1085
01:18:57.208 --> 01:18:59.608
<i>Attention, please. 
Attention, please.</i>

1086
01:18:59.678 --> 01:19:02.977
<i>Will Mrs. Milton
come to the desk, please.</i>


1087
01:19:05.383 --> 01:19:09.183
You take seat 18
in bus number three.


1088
01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:14.756
All right, Mrs. Rochard...

1089
01:19:14.826 --> 01:19:19.058
- you take seat 19 in bus number three.
- Thank you.


1090
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:23.328
- Wait a minute! You're not Mrs. Rochard.
- I'm Mr. Rochard.


1091
01:19:23.401 --> 01:19:26.393
It's your wife who must report here
for transportation to Bremerhaven.


1092
01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:30.339
<i>- According to the war department,
I am my wife.
- You can't be your wife!</i>


1093
01:19:30.408 --> 01:19:34.208
If the American army says that I can
be my wife, who am I to dispute them?


1094
01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:39.012
- This is all wrong.
- Major, for your information, I am a war bride.


1095
01:19:39.084 --> 01:19:41.575
- A war bride?
- Yeah.


1096
01:19:41.653 --> 01:19:43.814
- Well, I'm slightly confused.
- I don't blame you...


1097
01:19:43.888 --> 01:19:47.324
but the official wording says
I am "an alien spouse...


1098
01:19:47.392 --> 01:19:50.361
"of female military personnel
en route to the United States...


1099
01:19:50.428 --> 01:19:53.363
under public law 271
of the congress."


1100
01:19:53.431 --> 01:19:57.197
This is a strange situation,
but I suppose it's perfectly legal.


1101
01:19:57.268 --> 01:20:00.999
- Yes, it is.
- Well, um, Mrs. Roch... I mean, Mr. Rochard...


1102
01:20:01.072 --> 01:20:05.008
it won't be necessary
for you to stop at the, uh, nurse's desk.


1103
01:20:05.076 --> 01:20:06.839
- No?
- No.


1104
01:20:06.911 --> 01:20:08.879
Oh.

1105
01:20:13.618 --> 01:20:15.586
<i>Attention, please.</i>

1106
01:20:15.653 --> 01:20:19.646
<i>Will all passengers be sure
to have their baggage checked
before boarding the buses.</i>


1107
01:20:19.724 --> 01:20:22.693
<i>Will all passengers
be sure to have their baggage checked...</i>


1108
01:20:22.761 --> 01:20:25.093
<i>before boarding the buses.</i>

1109
01:20:25.163 --> 01:20:29.725
<i>Will Mrs. Turner...
Mrs. Turner please come to the desk.</i>


1110
01:20:29.801 --> 01:20:32.167
<i>Will Mrs. Turner please
come to the desk.</i>


1111
01:20:40.812 --> 01:20:42.780
He's crying, the baby.

1112
01:20:42.847 --> 01:20:46.578
- Is that what he's doing?
- He wants water, yes?


1113
01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:50.417
I wouldn't know, madame. When I want water,
I have a different way of asking for it.


1114
01:20:50.488 --> 01:20:55.016
- He is a baby. You are a man.
- Thanks.


1115
01:20:55.093 --> 01:20:57.994
I'll get him some water.
You hold the baby, please.


1116
01:20:58.062 --> 01:21:00.656
- Well, l... No, no, l...
- I'll only be a minute.


1117
01:21:00.732 --> 01:21:03.360
But I don't know anything about...

1118
01:21:03.434 --> 01:21:06.335
Oh, my good... 
Yes, yes, yes.

1119
01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:09.737
Yes, yes, yes.

1120
01:21:12.977 --> 01:21:15.445
Yes, yes.

1121
01:21:20.652 --> 01:21:22.586
<i>Attention, please.</i>

1122
01:21:22.654 --> 01:21:28.286
Ladies, please stop moving about
and stay where you are till I finish.


1123
01:21:28.359 --> 01:21:30.554
Ladies, you are now on
the first leg of your journey...


1124
01:21:30.628 --> 01:21:33.028
to the United States
as guests of the army.


1125
01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.463
<i>Arrangements have been
made for your comfort...</i>


1126
01:21:35.533 --> 01:21:38.161
<i>in Bremerhaven
at the dependents'hotel.</i>


1127
01:21:38.236 --> 01:21:41.569
<i>You'll be able to get anything you need
at the P.X. There...</i>


1128
01:21:41.639 --> 01:21:45.040
<i>such as lipstick,
hair nets, garter belts...</i>


1129
01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:47.737
<i>foundation garments
and so forth.</i>


1130
01:21:47.812 --> 01:21:52.374
<i>Now, a lot of you have asked me about
the newest styles in the good old U.S.A.</i>


1131
01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:56.477
<i>- Well, hair's being worn shorter,
close to the head.
- Oh.</i>


1132
01:21:56.554 --> 01:22:02.015
<i>Skirts are long, of course, and rather
hippy with that full-blown look.</i>


1133
01:22:02.093 --> 01:22:05.494
<i>The trend is to
the natural bustline and...</i>


1134
01:22:05.563 --> 01:22:08.726
<i>between us, girls,
looking around the room...</i>


1135
01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.325
<i>I don't think
any of you need to worry.</i>


1136
01:22:11.402 --> 01:22:15.133
<i>Now, if you'll just move out
in order, the buses are ready.</i>


1137
01:22:15.206 --> 01:22:18.141
<i>Happyjourney, ladies.</i>

1138
01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:25.081
Uh...

1139
01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:30.116
- Well, he has to be here somewhere.
- I know.


1140
01:22:30.188 --> 01:22:34.386
- Oh, look. Oh, look!
- Oh, no. Oh, no.


1141
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.196
- Ah, Henri, you look so maternal.
- What is that?


1142
01:22:39.264 --> 01:22:43.064
- A human fire extinguisher. You wanna try it?
- Oh, come on.


1143
01:22:43.134 --> 01:22:46.262
- Oh, he's cute. What's his name?
- Niagara.


1144
01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:48.828
- Henri, what a thing to do.
- Where's the mother?


1145
01:22:48.907 --> 01:22:51.398
- She went to get more water.
- She ought to get a plumber.


1146
01:22:51.476 --> 01:22:54.274
- Henri, you've got to get out of here.
- How can we when we still...


1147
01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:57.473
<i>- There's the mother.
- Thank you so much. I'm sorry.</i>


1148
01:22:57.548 --> 01:22:59.482
- Let's get going.
- Oh, darling.


1149
01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:01.711
<i>Mr. Rochard.! Mr. Rochard.!</i>

1150
01:23:01.786 --> 01:23:05.984
<i>Your seat in the bus has been changed.
You're sitting with the driver.</i>


1151
01:23:06.057 --> 01:23:08.355
Oh, no. I thought
I'd be able to sit with you.


1152
01:23:08.426 --> 01:23:10.346
You can't. Kitty and I
are flying to Bremerhaven.


1153
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:12.329
- What?
- The whole outfit's going that way.


1154
01:23:12.397 --> 01:23:15.264
- Oh, no!
- I'll be there to meet you when you come in.


1155
01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:17.665
Will you try to arrange things so that
we can be together in Bremerhaven?


1156
01:23:17.735 --> 01:23:21.535
- I hope so, Henri. I'll try.
- Well, if you don't,
I won't sit with the driver.


1157
01:23:21.606 --> 01:23:24.074
- You want me to carry that?
- No, thank you.


1158
01:23:24.142 --> 01:23:26.838
Oh. All right.

1159
01:23:44.762 --> 01:23:47.560
- Darling, was it bad?
- Oh, 30 women.


1160
01:23:47.632 --> 01:23:51.033
With the exception of you, dear, I may never
talk with another one again as long as I live.


1161
01:23:51.102 --> 01:23:53.730
- Poor Henri.
- Let's get away from here.


1162
01:23:53.805 --> 01:23:56.399
- Where are you staying? Where do we go?
- You don't, Henri.


1163
01:23:56.474 --> 01:23:59.875
- I don't? But you mean you couldn't fix it?
- They wouldn't hear of it.


1164
01:23:59.944 --> 01:24:02.071
I'm in building 11 across town,
and you stay here.


1165
01:24:02.146 --> 01:24:05.445
- But isn't there any chance?
- I've argued for an hour, darling.


1166
01:24:05.516 --> 01:24:08.815
Oh, well, I'm learning what it is
to be a soldier's wife.


1167
01:24:08.886 --> 01:24:10.911
I know, dear.
I feel the same way.


1168
01:24:10.989 --> 01:24:13.253
Tomorrow night on the boat,
everything will be different.


1169
01:24:13.324 --> 01:24:15.258
To make things worse,
I've gotta go now.


1170
01:24:15.326 --> 01:24:18.022
Come on, Kitty. I'll meet you
on the dock in the morning.


1171
01:24:18.096 --> 01:24:20.462
- Get a good night's sleep.
- That's all I've been getting.


1172
01:24:20.531 --> 01:24:23.830
- Hello, Henri. Good-bye, Henri.
- Hello. Good-bye.


1173
01:24:23.901 --> 01:24:26.028
Hello. Good-bye.

1174
01:24:32.377 --> 01:24:34.402
<i>Put your name
and address on the list.</i>


1175
01:24:34.479 --> 01:24:37.141
<i>You understand there'll be
a little wait for transportation...</i>


1176
01:24:37.215 --> 01:24:39.183
<i>because we've got
a lot of people to attend to.</i>


1177
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:43.516
<i>But if you'll just fill out that form and
bring it back here, I'll see if I can help.</i>


1178
01:24:43.588 --> 01:24:46.022
I'm sorry, sir.
Visiting hours are over.


1179
01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:48.183
You can come and see
your wife tomorrow.


1180
01:24:48.259 --> 01:24:52.559
My wife will have to visit me
tomorrow. I am billeted here.


1181
01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:54.564
- You are?
- Yes.


1182
01:24:54.632 --> 01:24:58.796
But you can't... Lieutenant.
There must be some mistake.


1183
01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:02.499
No mistake. I am an alien spouse
of female military personnel...


1184
01:25:02.573 --> 01:25:06.600
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.


1185
01:25:06.677 --> 01:25:10.374
- Good grief.
- The manifest calls for 139 war brides...


1186
01:25:10.448 --> 01:25:13.906
126 children of war brides,
nine dogs of war brides...


1187
01:25:13.985 --> 01:25:16.317
three cats, two canaries,
one parrot...


1188
01:25:16.387 --> 01:25:18.480
- Oh, yes, here you are.
- Then me.


1189
01:25:18.556 --> 01:25:22.583
You must have been added later.
One war bride, male.


1190
01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:25.561
- Is that you?
- That's me.


1191
01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:27.928
- Well, now, there's a problem.
- Why?


1192
01:25:27.999 --> 01:25:30.593
- Because you can't stay here.
- I have to stay here.


1193
01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:33.330
- I am billeted here.
- Well, if you insist.


1194
01:25:33.404 --> 01:25:35.964
But we already have from three
to ten women in every room.


1195
01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.703
To say nothing of the dogs and cats.
I mean, you can't stay here.


1196
01:25:39.777 --> 01:25:44.043
I can't stay here, huh?

1197
01:25:44.115 --> 01:25:46.675
I think the place for you is the
officers' billet in the staging area.


1198
01:25:46.751 --> 01:25:49.879
- It won't be half as interesting.
- It's just down the street...


1199
01:25:49.954 --> 01:25:51.888
the third building on the left.

1200
01:25:51.956 --> 01:25:56.120
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, yeah. Thank you.


1201
01:25:56.194 --> 01:25:58.128
I'm sorry.

1202
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:15.706
- Hello.
- Hello.


1203
01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:18.374
I suppose you wonder
what I want here.


1204
01:26:18.449 --> 01:26:20.576
Well, I will if you want me to.

1205
01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.214
I'm an alien spouse
of female military personnel...


1206
01:26:25.289 --> 01:26:29.817
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.


1207
01:26:29.894 --> 01:26:31.987
- Huh?
- I am a war bride.


1208
01:26:32.063 --> 01:26:35.760
No kiddin'.
That's interesting.


1209
01:26:37.468 --> 01:26:40.266
Would it interest you enough
to give me a bed?


1210
01:26:40.338 --> 01:26:42.508
- Oh, you can't sleep here, Mac.
- Why not?


1211
01:26:42.641 --> 01:26:44.632
- Are you an American officer?
- No.


1212
01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:47.736
That's why you can't sleep here.
You go to the dependents' hotel.


1213
01:26:47.813 --> 01:26:51.613
I have just come from
the dependents' hotel.


1214
01:26:51.683 --> 01:26:53.617
- You mean the one here in Bremerhaven?
- Mm-hmm.


1215
01:26:53.685 --> 01:26:55.880
I mean the one down
at the staging area.


1216
01:26:55.954 --> 01:26:58.752
I'm afraid I'm much too tired
to walk all that distance.


1217
01:26:58.824 --> 01:27:01.520
Well, suit yourself, Mac,
but you can't sleep here.


1218
01:27:01.593 --> 01:27:04.824
Uh, yeah. Well, there must be a bed
that isn't being used.


1219
01:27:04.897 --> 01:27:07.832
- You must have a bed. Where is it?
- Right across the street.


1220
01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.869
- Well, uh...
- My wife's in it, and you can't...


1221
01:27:10.936 --> 01:27:14.770
No, no, of course not.
Yes. Quite right. Naturally.


1222
01:27:15.941 --> 01:27:17.875
Well, it's...

1223
01:27:20.178 --> 01:27:22.237
Oh, brother.

1224
01:27:24.816 --> 01:27:28.411
- Right down this way.
- This is awfully kind of you, Sergeant.


1225
01:27:28.487 --> 01:27:31.945
I'm a private, mister, but you gotta sleep
somewhere, even if you ain't in the army.


1226
01:27:32.024 --> 01:27:34.458
You won't get into
any trouble, will you?


1227
01:27:34.526 --> 01:27:37.222
What are they gonna do,
bust a private to a civilian?


1228
01:27:37.296 --> 01:27:39.992
- This ain't the Ritz, but it ought to do.
- It's fine.


1229
01:27:40.065 --> 01:27:42.761
I'm grateful to find
a friend like you.


1230
01:27:42.834 --> 01:27:45.803
- Tell me, where do you live
in the United States?
- Brooklyn.


1231
01:27:45.871 --> 01:27:48.533
- I'll look you up when I get there.
- Get a good sleep.


1232
01:27:48.607 --> 01:27:51.474
Thank you.

1233
01:28:03.555 --> 01:28:05.523
Hey. Hey!

1234
01:28:05.591 --> 01:28:07.616
- No, no, no, thank you.
- Wake up.


1235
01:28:07.693 --> 01:28:11.789
<i>- No, no, no. Not now, thank you.
- What are you doin'here?</i>


1236
01:28:11.863 --> 01:28:14.263
Oh, I had a feeling.

1237
01:28:17.703 --> 01:28:20.536
I am an alien spouse
of female military personnel...


1238
01:28:20.606 --> 01:28:24.474
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.


1239
01:28:24.543 --> 01:28:27.512
Well, why aren't you
at the dependents' hotel?


1240
01:28:27.579 --> 01:28:29.877
I am writing a book about that.

1241
01:28:29.948 --> 01:28:32.416
You see, I'm not a woman.

1242
01:28:32.484 --> 01:28:35.317
That's too bad.
But I tell you one thing, friend...


1243
01:28:35.387 --> 01:28:37.912
- You can't sleep here.
- Can't sleep here.


1244
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:42.154
You will note, I have not taken
off my clothes in anticipation of that.


1245
01:28:42.227 --> 01:28:45.219
- Where will I go?
- I don't know, but you...


1246
01:28:45.297 --> 01:28:47.231
- Can't sleep here.
- That's right.


1247
01:28:47.299 --> 01:28:49.358
We're agreed.
Where will I go?


1248
01:28:49.434 --> 01:28:52.164
Well, there's only one place left,
and that's a German hotel.


1249
01:28:52.237 --> 01:28:54.228
- But you're a dependent, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.


1250
01:28:54.306 --> 01:28:56.638
And as a dependent,
you come under military law...


1251
01:28:56.708 --> 01:28:59.609
and all the German hotels
are out of bounds.


1252
01:28:59.678 --> 01:29:02.476
- Where will I go?
- I don't know, mister.


1253
01:29:02.547 --> 01:29:04.515
I'm sorry,
but there's an army rule.


1254
01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:07.575
- And you can't sleep here.
- Can't sleep here.


1255
01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:13.817
Beg your pardon.

1256
01:29:15.627 --> 01:29:19.825
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.


1257
01:29:19.898 --> 01:29:22.025
It's a shame.
Because if we was in Brooklyn...


1258
01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.660
you could've slept
with the old man.


1259
01:29:44.523 --> 01:29:46.457
Hiya.

1260
01:29:47.759 --> 01:29:49.750
Oh. Hi.

1261
01:29:52.197 --> 01:29:55.098
- What can I do for you?
- Well, uh...


1262
01:29:55.167 --> 01:29:57.533
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
Can you help me?


1263
01:29:57.602 --> 01:29:59.866
Afraid not. Nothing but women
sleepin' in there.


1264
01:29:59.938 --> 01:30:02.839
Yeah, I know. Building 11.
My wife's in there.


1265
01:30:02.908 --> 01:30:05.809
- A lot of people's wives are in there.
- Yeah.


1266
01:30:05.877 --> 01:30:09.836
Have you ever noticed that women always get
a place to sleep? I wonder why that is.


1267
01:30:09.915 --> 01:30:12.577
Well, I suppose it's because
they're the weaker sex.


1268
01:30:12.651 --> 01:30:16.382
I don't believe it. I believe
they're stronger. And do you know why?


1269
01:30:16.455 --> 01:30:18.616
Because they get enough sleep,
that's why.


1270
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:21.284
I am sorry I can't help you.

1271
01:30:21.359 --> 01:30:24.692
Well, very kind of you, Corporal.

1272
01:30:24.763 --> 01:30:27.231
Good night. You from Brooklyn?

1273
01:30:27.299 --> 01:30:29.790
Yonkers.

1274
01:30:29.868 --> 01:30:31.893
What are those?

1275
01:30:33.872 --> 01:30:36.170
Good night, buddy.

1276
01:30:46.251 --> 01:30:49.948
I am an alien spouse of female military
personnel en route to the United States...


1277
01:30:50.021 --> 01:30:52.615
under public law 271
of the congress...


1278
01:30:52.691 --> 01:30:54.625
and I've been everywhere in town
looking for a place to sleep.


1279
01:30:54.693 --> 01:30:58.459
You poor man. Well, you can't stay here.
This is a female building.


1280
01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:01.693
It is?

1281
01:31:01.767 --> 01:31:04.930
Another woman's building.
You know, I've come to the conclusion...


1282
01:31:05.003 --> 01:31:07.062
that American men don't sleep.

1283
01:31:07.139 --> 01:31:09.903
Well, not in this building.

1284
01:31:09.975 --> 01:31:13.138
I was wondering if there'd be any
objection to my sitting here for a while.


1285
01:31:13.211 --> 01:31:16.146
You could sort of imagine
I'm waiting for something.


1286
01:31:16.214 --> 01:31:19.775
Well, it all depends on what
you imagine you're waiting for.


1287
01:31:19.851 --> 01:31:22.615
I'm sure I don't want to send you
out on a night like this.


1288
01:31:22.687 --> 01:31:25.850
That's very kind. That's nice.

1289
01:31:25.924 --> 01:31:29.325
Tell me, what part of the United States
do you come from?


1290
01:31:29.394 --> 01:31:33.763
- Boston, up in Massachusetts.
- Massachu-chu-chu...


1291
01:31:33.832 --> 01:31:36.164
Right. Is there a place
called Yonkers?


1292
01:31:36.234 --> 01:31:39.771
- Sure. It's in New York.
- Oh. I was wondering.


1293
01:31:39.904 --> 01:31:42.634
Well, I'm...
I'm a little mixed up.


1294
01:31:42.707 --> 01:31:45.870
- May I hold that for you?
- Oh, thanks.


1295
01:31:45.943 --> 01:31:48.036
You see, I just got married.

1296
01:31:48.112 --> 01:31:50.103
Well, where's your wife?

1297
01:31:50.181 --> 01:31:53.480
Oh, she's in another female building.
Building 11.


1298
01:31:53.551 --> 01:31:57.043
- And you couldn't find a bed anywhere?
- No... Well, almost.


1299
01:31:57.121 --> 01:31:59.055
There was, uh...
There was one in Brooklyn...


1300
01:31:59.123 --> 01:32:01.421
- and another one with a woman in it.
- A woman?


1301
01:32:01.492 --> 01:32:04.325
- He was a very disagreeable man.
- Who was?


1302
01:32:04.395 --> 01:32:08.024
Her husband. Yeah, it would've been
nicer in Brooklyn.


1303
01:32:08.099 --> 01:32:11.557
- With the husband?
- No. The old man.


1304
01:32:11.636 --> 01:32:13.831
<i>You are tired, aren't you?</i>

1305
01:32:24.182 --> 01:32:26.946
- There he is. I'll see you on the boat.
- Okay.


1306
01:32:27.018 --> 01:32:28.952
Pardon me. Excuse me.

1307
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.079
Pardon me.

1308
01:32:33.057 --> 01:32:35.651
Oh, darling, I was afraid
you'd missed the last bus.


1309
01:32:35.726 --> 01:32:39.355
- Oh, sailor, could you take these bags, please?
- All right.


1310
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:42.365
Thank you. Henri...
Henri, you look awful.


1311
01:32:42.433 --> 01:32:44.924
- What have you been doing?
- I've been sitting up
all night with a redhead.


1312
01:32:45.002 --> 01:32:46.765
- What?
- Knitting.


1313
01:32:46.838 --> 01:32:48.897
- What?
- You ought to see me purl.


1314
01:32:48.973 --> 01:32:51.840
- Oh, you ought to see her purl.
- What are you talking about?


1315
01:32:51.909 --> 01:32:53.843
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

1316
01:32:53.911 --> 01:32:56.778
<i>Please get on board as soon as possible...
as soon as possible, please.</i>


1317
01:32:56.848 --> 01:32:59.339
- I'd like to show you how to do that sometime.
- We gotta go.


1318
01:32:59.417 --> 01:33:00.941
- Got your papers?
- What?


1319
01:33:01.018 --> 01:33:02.978
- Have you got your papers?
- They're right there.


1320
01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:05.301
Listen, darling. All we have to do
is get aboard the ship.


1321
01:33:05.323 --> 01:33:08.315
Remember, no back talk, no argument.
Just keep your temper. Promise?


1322
01:33:08.392 --> 01:33:10.587
- I promise.
- All right. Come on.


1323
01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:13.459
<i>You've been to the navy personnel.
They'll clear you through.</i>


1324
01:33:13.531 --> 01:33:15.431
Here's your boarding card.

1325
01:33:15.499 --> 01:33:18.627
Your orders, please, Lieutenant.
Thank you.


1326
01:33:18.703 --> 01:33:21.900
- Lieutenant Gates.
- Right.


1327
01:33:21.973 --> 01:33:24.066
- Here's your boarding card, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.


1328
01:33:24.141 --> 01:33:26.075
- Surely.
- What do you want, mister?


1329
01:33:26.143 --> 01:33:30.603
- I want to go aboard.
- I'm sorry. This ship is
for war brides and a few...


1330
01:33:30.681 --> 01:33:34.811
I know. I know, Sergeant.
Here are my orders.


1331
01:33:34.886 --> 01:33:37.286
Have you got a Rochard
on your list?


1332
01:33:37.355 --> 01:33:39.915
- Yeah, a Mrs. Henri Rochard.
- That's me.


1333
01:33:39.991 --> 01:33:42.186
- You're not a woman.
- We don't want you. We want your wife.


1334
01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:45.093
You can't have my wife.
That's one thing I'm particular about.


1335
01:33:45.162 --> 01:33:48.154
- Henri.
- Oh, yes, Catherine, I'll remember.


1336
01:33:48.232 --> 01:33:52.066
There's been a slight misunderstanding,
gentlemen. My name is Henri Rochard.


1337
01:33:52.136 --> 01:33:54.661
Henri. Have you ever heard
of a woman called Henri?


1338
01:33:54.739 --> 01:33:57.469
I'm tryin' to think.
You know a lot of dames, Sam.


1339
01:33:57.541 --> 01:34:00.339
- I know a Billie.
- I don't know any. Maybe he's right.


1340
01:34:00.411 --> 01:34:02.538
- You see, I am a war bride.
- What?


1341
01:34:02.613 --> 01:34:04.774
- This is my wife.
- Oh.


1342
01:34:04.849 --> 01:34:07.841
It's a very natural mistake.
You're not the first to have made it.


1343
01:34:07.919 --> 01:34:09.978
Now, if my papers are in order,
may I go aboard?


1344
01:34:10.054 --> 01:34:12.921
I guess we'll have
to let him go on.


1345
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:15.515
- Here's your boarding card.
- Thank you. Good day.


1346
01:34:15.593 --> 01:34:17.356
- Good day.
- Good day.


1347
01:34:17.428 --> 01:34:19.362
You were wonderful, Henri.

1348
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:21.591
I knew if you kept your temper,
everything would be all right.


1349
01:34:21.666 --> 01:34:23.998
- I thought I behaved quite well.
- Oh, you did.


1350
01:34:24.068 --> 01:34:27.128
May I see your orders, please?

1351
01:34:27.204 --> 01:34:30.298
- Stateroom B-14, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.


1352
01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:36.343
How'd you get up here? This ship is
for war brides and military personnel.


1353
01:34:36.414 --> 01:34:38.882
Yes, yes, I know.
My name is Rochard.


1354
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:41.441
You'll think I'm a bride,
but actually, I'm a husband.


1355
01:34:41.519 --> 01:34:43.453
There'll be a moment
or two of confusion...


1356
01:34:43.521 --> 01:34:47.821
- but if we all keep our heads,
everything will be fine.
- I don't think it will.


1357
01:34:47.892 --> 01:34:50.759
- I've got a Mrs. "Rotcherd" on my list.
- Rochard!


1358
01:34:50.828 --> 01:34:53.695
She's in A-88 with two other brides
and three children.


1359
01:34:53.764 --> 01:34:57.495
- Oh, well, that, of course,
will have to be altered.
- Not by me it won't.


1360
01:34:57.568 --> 01:34:59.832
I have just explained everything
to the army.


1361
01:34:59.904 --> 01:35:01.895
They understood.
They passed me.


1362
01:35:01.973 --> 01:35:03.907
The army understood,
and they passed you.


1363
01:35:03.975 --> 01:35:06.034
Oh, that's fine.
That's just dandy.


1364
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:09.170
Did you hear that? The army understood,
and they passed him.


1365
01:35:09.246 --> 01:35:11.180
This is the navy, bud.

1366
01:35:11.248 --> 01:35:14.877
- My friend, I have had weeks of
the United States Army, and...
- Henri.


1367
01:35:14.952 --> 01:35:18.183
And I'm quite prepared
to take on the United States Navy.


1368
01:35:18.255 --> 01:35:22.419
And the United States Navy's
quite prepared to take you on, mister.


1369
01:35:22.493 --> 01:35:24.586
Hey, fellas,
get this guy out of here.


1370
01:35:24.662 --> 01:35:27.062
Just a minute. Have you heard
of a woman called Henri?


1371
01:35:27.131 --> 01:35:30.658
Yeah. Henrietta. Powell Street.
San Francisco. Take him.


1372
01:35:30.735 --> 01:35:33.465
- No, no, no. No. Never mind. Never mind.
- Get goin'.


1373
01:35:33.537 --> 01:35:36.631
All right, I'm going.
Just go on about your business.


1374
01:35:42.847 --> 01:35:46.374
Henri, you shouldn't have lost
your temper. Where are you going?


1375
01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:48.645
I'm going someplace to change
back into a man.


1376
01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:52.485
- I'm tired of being my own wife.
- You can't give up now.


1377
01:35:52.556 --> 01:35:55.024
- Well, make them give up. Someone has to.
- Listen, will you?


1378
01:35:55.092 --> 01:35:58.186
Once on board that ship, everything
will be over, and you'll be a man forever.


1379
01:35:58.262 --> 01:36:00.594
- Now, it's worth a try, isn't it, darling?
- How can we?


1380
01:36:00.664 --> 01:36:03.531
- Well, Henri, I don't know...
- Lieutenant, would you take this bag for me?


1381
01:36:03.601 --> 01:36:07.503
- I left something on the bus.
- I'll have someone put it
in the mess hall for you.


1382
01:36:07.571 --> 01:36:09.664
- Now, what were you saying?
- Henri, do you love me?


1383
01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:12.834
- Of course I love you.
- And you'll make one more try
to get aboard that boat?


1384
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:14.844
- If you say so.
- You promise?


1385
01:36:14.912 --> 01:36:16.846
- I promise.
- And you'll keep it?


1386
01:36:16.914 --> 01:36:18.848
- I promised, didn't I?
- All right. Come on.


1387
01:36:20.117 --> 01:36:22.210
Here. Hold these.

1388
01:36:22.286 --> 01:36:24.117
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

1389
01:36:24.188 --> 01:36:28.284
Nah, that won't do.
Oh, here's a better one here.


1390
01:36:28.359 --> 01:36:30.452
Whoa, boy. Whoa, fella.

1391
01:36:30.528 --> 01:36:32.758
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Henri. Lean down.


1392
01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:36.163
Lean down close. I wanna
see somethin'. Uh-huh. That goes perfect.


1393
01:36:36.233 --> 01:36:38.167
- With what?
- Give me your knife.


1394
01:36:38.235 --> 01:36:40.169
You're not going to...
I won't do it.


1395
01:36:40.237 --> 01:36:42.705
- This will make a perfectly good wig.
- I won't do it.


1396
01:36:42.773 --> 01:36:45.367
- And we've got the clothes right here.
- Catherine, I will not do it.


1397
01:36:45.443 --> 01:36:47.707
- But, Henri, you said you loved me.
- Well, I'm not so sure now.


1398
01:36:47.778 --> 01:36:51.270
<i>And you promised. 
Give me your knife.</i>

1399
01:36:51.348 --> 01:36:54.442
Come on, Henri.
There's not much time.


1400
01:36:56.821 --> 01:36:59.813
This is ridiculous.

1401
01:36:59.890 --> 01:37:02.757
Catherine, can't you at least
cut it off the mane?


1402
01:37:02.827 --> 01:37:04.954
Henri, you're taking this
much too personally.


1403
01:37:05.029 --> 01:37:08.465
Now, stand so no one
can see what I'm doing.


1404
01:37:24.782 --> 01:37:26.977
Mmm, a little tough.

1405
01:37:28.285 --> 01:37:31.743
Hmm. Won't be so bad
when I get your bangs rolled.


1406
01:37:31.822 --> 01:37:34.256
Wanna see what you look like?

1407
01:37:36.427 --> 01:37:38.361
Horrible.

1408
01:37:38.429 --> 01:37:40.897
I don't think I'll be called
upon to defend my honor.


1409
01:37:40.965 --> 01:37:43.456
- I doubt it.
- It's a pity.


1410
01:37:43.534 --> 01:37:46.628
- I wonder if some lipstick would help.
- Oh, no.


1411
01:37:46.704 --> 01:37:50.162
- Well, why not?
- I'm more the outdoor type.


1412
01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:52.801
Sea Biscuit. Bang Tail.
You know?


1413
01:37:52.877 --> 01:37:56.210
Oh, silly, hold still.
Let me roll these.


1414
01:38:06.056 --> 01:38:08.854
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot somethin'.
Can you talk like a woman?


1415
01:38:08.926 --> 01:38:11.486
- You mean like this?
- Can't you do better than that?


1416
01:38:11.562 --> 01:38:14.690
- No.
- Just remember... Keep your
mouth closed. Not a word.


1417
01:38:14.765 --> 01:38:18.098
Leave everything to me.
And keep your head down.


1418
01:38:21.505 --> 01:38:24.099
Oh, sailor, would you put this
in the mess hall for me, please?


1419
01:38:24.175 --> 01:38:26.234
- Sure, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.


1420
01:38:27.244 --> 01:38:31.374
Wait a moment.

1421
01:38:31.448 --> 01:38:33.916
Hey, did you hear that?
I must look pretty good.


1422
01:38:33.984 --> 01:38:36.111
- Don't be silly. That was for me.
- For you?


1423
01:38:36.187 --> 01:38:38.155
- Of course.
- I ought to punch him in the nose.


1424
01:38:38.222 --> 01:38:42.022
- Henri, remember, you're a lady.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.


1425
01:38:46.997 --> 01:38:51.263
- We have our boarding cards.
We've been up before.
- Go ahead.


1426
01:38:54.371 --> 01:38:56.464
I don't remember
that tall one, Sam.


1427
01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:00.442
- It's hard to believe you could
forget a face like that.
- Yeah.


1428
01:39:02.012 --> 01:39:04.503
Lieutenant Gates. B-14.
I was up before.


1429
01:39:04.582 --> 01:39:07.415
Oh, yes. Your orders, please.

1430
01:39:09.019 --> 01:39:12.011
Say, that's funny. Rochard.

1431
01:39:12.089 --> 01:39:14.489
Why aren't you listed among
the military personnel, Lieutenant?


1432
01:39:14.558 --> 01:39:17.493
Save your voice. You'll have to
excuse her. She has laryngitis.


1433
01:39:17.561 --> 01:39:20.553
- Now, what were you saying?
- Why isn't the lieutenant
listed among military personnel?


1434
01:39:20.631 --> 01:39:24.158
- Well, you see, she was just married.
- Married? That may be, but...


1435
01:39:24.235 --> 01:39:27.329
Hey, Red. Come here.

1436
01:39:27.404 --> 01:39:32.103
- What's the trouble?
- This lieutenant is listed as a missus.


1437
01:39:32.176 --> 01:39:35.270
Why'd they put you
down as mi...


1438
01:39:35.346 --> 01:39:38.281
How do you do?

1439
01:39:38.349 --> 01:39:42.479
- Why'd they put you down as
missus instead of lieutenant?
- She has laryngitis.


1440
01:39:42.553 --> 01:39:45.545
They possibly didn't list her
as lieutenant because of her husband.


1441
01:39:45.623 --> 01:39:48.285
- Who'd she marry?
- Admiral Rochard.


1442
01:39:48.359 --> 01:39:50.793
- Who?
- Admiral Rochard.


1443
01:39:50.861 --> 01:39:53.489
The name is familiar, but I don't
remember it connected with an admiral.


1444
01:39:53.564 --> 01:39:56.055
You never heard of her husband?
He won't like that.


1445
01:39:56.133 --> 01:39:58.192
Florence, if I were you,
I wouldn't say a word about this.


1446
01:39:58.269 --> 01:40:00.999
Sure. You heard of him, Red.
Admiral Rochard. Sure.


1447
01:40:01.071 --> 01:40:03.437
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe I have. All right.


1448
01:40:03.507 --> 01:40:06.670
- Stateroom A-88, Lieutenant.
- Get your instructions in the mess hall.


1449
01:40:06.744 --> 01:40:09.542
Thanks so much.
Come, Florence.


1450
01:40:14.418 --> 01:40:17.182
First time I ever felt sorry
for an admiral.


1451
01:40:17.254 --> 01:40:19.347
Gams aren't bad.

1452
01:40:19.423 --> 01:40:22.688
Now I'm beginning
to feel sorry for you.


1453
01:40:26.263 --> 01:40:28.390
- In here, please.
- We were just going...


1454
01:40:28.465 --> 01:40:32.663
- Please, Lieutenant. Your instructions first.
- Come on, Florence.


1455
01:40:34.138 --> 01:40:37.301
- I don't like that name Florence.
- Oh, shut up.


1456
01:40:38.342 --> 01:40:40.276
- Kitty.
- I've been waiting...


1457
01:40:40.344 --> 01:40:43.142
- Shh.
- Oh, no.


1458
01:40:43.213 --> 01:40:45.613
Stand on the other side
so they can't see so well.


1459
01:40:45.683 --> 01:40:48.516
This was the only way.
They wouldn't let him... Henri, duck down.


1460
01:40:48.585 --> 01:40:51.145
- I can hear quite well.
- You're too tall. Duck down.


1461
01:40:51.221 --> 01:40:53.849
- He looks awful.
- I didn't have much to work with.


1462
01:40:53.924 --> 01:40:56.620
I don't see how I could get him aboard.
You got a room where we can put him?


1463
01:40:56.694 --> 01:40:58.787
I've got a room, but they wouldn't
let a thing like that in.


1464
01:40:58.862 --> 01:41:01.558
We gotta hide him somewhere till we can
change his clothes and the boat sails.


1465
01:41:01.632 --> 01:41:04.157
- What about the linen...
- No, and the men's room won't do either.


1466
01:41:04.234 --> 01:41:06.361
- Somebody's spotted him already.
- What?


1467
01:41:06.437 --> 01:41:10.806
We need a nurse. It's an emergency.
Will you come with me, please?


1468
01:41:10.874 --> 01:41:13.843
- I'm a nurse?
- Come along, please.


1469
01:41:13.911 --> 01:41:15.845
I hadn't counted on this.

1470
01:41:27.991 --> 01:41:31.290
- It's very lucky they found a nurse.
- What's the matter?


1471
01:41:31.362 --> 01:41:35.196
- My wife's expectin' a baby.
- What? Oh, no!


1472
01:41:35.265 --> 01:41:39.929
- No. It isn't a very convenient time, is it?
- You can say that again.


1473
01:41:40.003 --> 01:41:42.870
- It isn't a very convenient time, is it?
- No. No, it isn't.


1474
01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:46.239
No. Oh, gee. I wonder if the baby
will be a girl.


1475
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:49.074
- I'll be grateful if it's a baby.
- You will?


1476
01:41:49.146 --> 01:41:52.377
Oh, you're very kind.

1477
01:41:52.449 --> 01:41:54.747
Gosh, l... I wish I knew
what was going on in there.


1478
01:41:54.818 --> 01:41:58.276
- Oh, you won't have long to wait.
- I won't?


1479
01:41:58.355 --> 01:42:02.018
Oh, gee whiz. Gosh, l... I don't think
I can stand this.


1480
01:42:02.092 --> 01:42:04.356
- You got a bigger shock coming.
- I have?


1481
01:42:04.428 --> 01:42:06.396
Mm-hmm.

1482
01:42:06.463 --> 01:42:08.590
- The lieutenant got a little dizzy.
- Thank you.


1483
01:42:08.665 --> 01:42:11.998
- I'll take care of her.
I'll get you some water, dear.
- Pardon me.


1484
01:42:12.069 --> 01:42:15.334
- Oh, this is the father, Florence.
- How do you do?


1485
01:42:15.406 --> 01:42:19.467
<i>Is it a boy or a... girl...</i>

1486
01:42:19.543 --> 01:42:21.773
Oh, no!

1487
01:42:23.614 --> 01:42:26.276
What happened to hi...

1488
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:28.944
Well, if it isn't Florence, huh?

1489
01:42:31.755 --> 01:42:34.019
Arrest that man.

1490
01:42:34.091 --> 01:42:37.219
- It's all right, Henri. The ship has sailed.
- Hmm?


1491
01:42:37.294 --> 01:42:39.888
Come along. Come on, Flo.

1492
01:42:59.616 --> 01:43:01.481
Florence.

1493
01:43:17.634 --> 01:43:19.761
Mr. Rochard, may we come in?

1494
01:43:19.837 --> 01:43:24.900
I don't see how I can stop you.
The key's on the outside.


1495
01:43:24.975 --> 01:43:28.342
Thank you. Henri, this is Lieutenant
Perkins and Commander Willis.


1496
01:43:28.412 --> 01:43:30.346
The commander's the chaplain.

1497
01:43:30.414 --> 01:43:33.577
Chaplain? Oh, no, no.
No, nothin' doing. I'm sorry, Chaplain.


1498
01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:36.414
- Nothing doing what?
- No more marriages. It isn't worth it.


1499
01:43:36.487 --> 01:43:38.978
- I'm not gonna marry her again, Chaplain.
- Why, Henri.


1500
01:43:39.056 --> 01:43:42.890
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We've got the whole thing straightened out.


1501
01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.157
I'm sorry about the mix-up, sir,
but your case was a little unusual.


1502
01:43:46.230 --> 01:43:49.028
You see, you're an alien spouse
of female military personnel...


1503
01:43:49.099 --> 01:43:53.229
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.


1504
01:43:53.303 --> 01:43:55.669
- Am I now?
- Yes, and under the circumstances...


1505
01:43:55.739 --> 01:43:58.640
- the captain would like
to forget the whole thing.


1506
01:43:58.709 --> 01:44:01.109
Don't you understand, dear?
You're free. You can go now.


1507
01:44:01.178 --> 01:44:03.112
- Where?
- Anywhere on the ship.


1508
01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.780
We've got you bunked in with one
of the officers. He doesn't mind.


1509
01:44:05.849 --> 01:44:08.909
I think he would mind.
He wouldn't like that at all.


1510
01:44:08.986 --> 01:44:12.114
- You see, I snore terribly.
- Why, Henri, you don't snore.


1511
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:14.123
- How would you know I don't?
- Oh.


1512
01:44:14.191 --> 01:44:18.252
Couldn't we do something simple?
Couldn't I just stay here?


1513
01:44:18.328 --> 01:44:21.092
- Well, l... I suppose that...
- I don't see why not.


1514
01:44:21.164 --> 01:44:23.724
Well, thank you. That's very nice.
You've been a great help.


1515
01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:27.292
Good night.
Thank you very much.


1516
01:44:27.371 --> 01:44:29.566
All right.

1517
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:34.901
Mm-hmm.

1518
01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.681
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.


1519
01:44:46.757 --> 01:44:49.089
I believe you would.

1520
01:44:52.696 --> 01:44:55.859
Henri, how will we ever
get out of here?


1521
01:44:55.933 --> 01:45:01.303
I'm not gonna worry about that until the
Statue of Liberty goes by that porthole.
