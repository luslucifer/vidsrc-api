1
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.786
(whirring)

2
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.819
(wind noise)

3
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.430
(engine revving)

4
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.268
- Sunday, August 215t, 1966.

5
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.904
A perfect day for an execution.

6
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.307
Approximately 122 miles
southwest of Las Vegas,


7
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.982
a 1963 Buick LeSabre,
license plate FUP744,


8
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.706
is hammering along US
highway 91, Interstate 15.


9
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.299
- Ed was driving my
car, a '63 Buick.


10
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.225
Pat Blackwell was
in the backseat with
all his camera stuff.


11
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.860
I had a typewriter with me
and it was Ed's typewriter.


12
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.584
One of the feet was broken
off of it and I said,


13
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.940
man, I don't have any
place to put my feet.


14
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.385
So I said, I'll buy you
another typewriter, Ed,


15
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.387
let's throw this
thing out the window.


16
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.387
And he said, toss it.

17
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.582
- [Darren] At 5:07 PM, the
passenger window rolls down.


18
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.382
- We saw a flat place
up ahead and I said,


19
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.979
okay, get her up to

20
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.023
at the right moment,
I just tossed it.


21
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.627
(shattering)
(engine revving)


22
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.263
- The wreckage stretches along
(ding)


23
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.223
189 feet of asphalt
and Nevada desert.


24
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.461
- Either me or Ed said,
you know we should go back


25
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.979
and photograph that.

26
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.021
If there was ever an
investigation of this,


27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.108
was it an accident
or was it a murder?


28
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.142
(plinky piano notes)

29
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.063
It was too directly
bound to its own anguish


30
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.068
to be anything other
than a cry of negation,


31
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.182
carrying within itself, the
seeds of its own destruction.


32
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.308
- Ed Ruscha and Mason
Williams' Royal Road Test


33
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.865
is still one of
my favorite books.


34
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.907
It looks like a
technical manual,


35
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.340
it's a little yellow,
spiral bound notebook.


36
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.262
The kind of thing that
you might have received


37
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.944
as an instruction manual
with any Royal typewriter.


38
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.061
- Scene of strewn wreckage.

39
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.101
Figure in foreground
points to impact area,


40
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.102
there is no real
explanation of it,


41
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.818
you're just kind of confronted
with the bald facts of it


42
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.660
and these really stark
black and white photos.


43
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.269
The kind of thing that
you might see if someone


44
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.506
was investigating a crime scene.

45
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.661
- [Mason] Carriage assembly.

46
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.703
- Then you're left trying
to make sense out of it.


47
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.703
(eerie piano notes)

48
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.022
When I found that book,

49
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.543
it was kind of a
definitive moment for me.


50
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.149
I looked at it and
I thought, yeah,


51
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.068
this is the grave
of typewriting,


52
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.545
this is the moment when
it stopped being one thing


53
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.388
and started being
something else.


54
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.102
- [Auctioneer] Here we are
now, Lot 84, Cormac McCarthy's


55
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.068
Olivetti manual typewriter,

56
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.380
on which he has typed all
but one of all of his novels,


57
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.581
including three
not yet published.


58
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.422
And I can open up.

59
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.144
It is on the left at
$45,000, $48,000, $50,000.


60
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.306
$60,000, 70,000.

61
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.579
$80,000.

62
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.382
$85,000.

63
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.148
(ding)
$90,000


64
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.578
$95,000.

65
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.145
$120,000, you came all this way.

66
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.146
$170,000.

67
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.429
$180,000.

68
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.020
$190,000.

69
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.300
$200,000.

70
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.143
Wanna say $210,000?

71
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.146
$210,000.

72
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.140
$210,000.

73
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.106
Last chance, at end
selling, $210,000.


74
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.103
Congratulations,
sir, Paddle 623.


75
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.989
(light jazz music)

76
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.780
- We've become
a throwaway society.


77
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.429
Obsolete,

78
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.098
depends on your point
of view, I guess.


79
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.665
We'll take care of it
for you, have it fixed


80
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.548
in no time at all, sir.

81
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.866
(clicking)

82
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.459
I've been repairing typewriters

83
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.304
here in Berkeley for 38 years.

84
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.701
You name it, I've
probably worked on it.


85
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.185
The first six or seven
years I was in this business


86
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.343
I ate, drank, slept
Smith Corona typewriters.


87
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.781
The Standards, the Sterlings,
the Clippers, the Silents,


88
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.982
the Super Silents, the
Galaxies, the Classic 125,


89
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.948
the Skywriters.

90
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.829
I like 'em because they've
got a cool, nice touch on 'em.


91
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.220
I think that Smith-Corona
is like a good version


92
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.500
of a Chevy, it holds up.

93
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.224
It's not a Benz like
maybe an Olympia might be,


94
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.579
but it's a good Chevy.

95
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.626
(clicking)

96
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.189
Quiet.

97
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.259
Dependable.

98
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.861
California Typewriters is a
small, family-run business.


99
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.221
It's just the owner Herb,
his daughters, and me.


100
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.189
- You have to push up on here.

101
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.944
- Herb bought the typewriter
shop back in the early 80$.


102
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.469
Just about the time
that personal computer


103
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.069
came on the scene.

104
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.744
(clicking)
(dings)


105
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.747
He's an ex
-IBM guy.

106
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.464
He knows the IBM Selectric
and the ball machine,


107
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.945
but he's probably the
best Selectric guy I know.


108
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.583
I mean, I've worked on a
few, but I can't come close


109
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.701
to his skills on a Selectric.

110
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.980
(clicking)

111
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.069
Herb's got a dream that people

112
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.345
are gonna come back
to typewriters.


113
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.267
- [Carmen] My dad believes
that there are various people


114
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.268
all over the place totally
excited about typewriters.


115
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.070
I think he thinks it's somewhat
of a wave of the future.


116
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.988
That more people are
gonna come back to them,


117
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.067
just for different reasons.

118
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.501
He's hopeful, for sure.

119
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.588
And he's willing to
spend his last dime.


120
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.985
(grunts)

121
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.381
(footsteps)

122
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.219
- I probably have 250 plus
typewriters in my collection


123
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.546
and I would say that 90% of them

124
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.980
are in perfect working order.

125
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:16.060
I've tried to foster a
community of typewriting people


126
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.141
and it hasn't quite worked.

127
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.306
I've given typewriters to folks,

128
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.738
because I have a lot of spares.

129
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.702
And if somebody says,

130
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.263
jeez, I'd like to have a
typewriter to write letters.


131
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.661
It's on their desk
within 48 hours,


132
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.225
with a note from me explaining
the typewriter to them.


133
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.949
I go to their houses later on

134
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.299
and they have it up
on a shelf somewhere


135
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.307
like it's an object of art.

136
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.070
And I say, get that bad boy
down, put it on your desk.


137
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.743
Have it right there

138
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.860
so you can always type
something to somebody.


139
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.066
(clacking)

140
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.261
I type almost every day.

141
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.301
There's usually a memo that
I'm sending to somebody


142
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.583
or a question or a thank you
note or an actual response.


143
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.061
I hate getting email
thank yous from folks.


144
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.783
Hey, we had a great
time last night.


145
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.787
Or, hey, I really
appreciated it.


146
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.788
So, really, you appreciated
it so much that you


147
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.742
took seven seconds
to send me an email.


148
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.305
Now if they take 70 seconds
to type me out something


149
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.063
on a piece of paper
and send it to me,


150
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.749
well, I'll keep that forever.

151
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.702
Otherwise I'll just
delete that email.


152
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.066
Look, there's always gonna be
great watches that are made,


153
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.107
you'll have to pay
a premium for them.


154
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.141
The truth is, no
good typewriters


155
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.306
are ever gonna be made again.

156
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.863
No matter how much of a premium

157
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.941
you're gonna want
to pay for 'em.


158
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.106
There is no factory, there is
no businessman in the world


159
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.538
who's going to open
up a factory and says,


160
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.660
we

161
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.662
are going to make

162
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.220
the finest typewriter that
will last absolutely forever


163
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.742
and anybody who is
willing to pay the $17,000


164
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.622
for a Hanks Typewriter.

165
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.263
Well, they're gonna pass
it down to their gen...


166
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.625
No, that's not gonna...

167
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.502
They might do that with a watch.

168
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.462
You might do that, there'll
always be a new iPad


169
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.467
that's coming down the pike,

170
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.467
there's always gonna be good
cars and things like that,


171
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.104
but no one is ever going to
make the great typewriter


172
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.147
ever, ever, ever again.

173
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.538
Boo hoo.

174
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.742
(downtempo jazz music)

175
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.100
(scraping)

176
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.826
- When I was a kid I didn't
really think about the future.


177
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.828
We were constantly
building things.


178
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.624
We built go carts,
we built balsa wood gliders,


179
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.424
we built a five-story
tree house.


180
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.029
And it was the house

181
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.749
that the neighborhood
kids came to play.


182
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.861
My parents didn't
care what we did,


183
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.220
they didn't worry about noise
and we could build things


184
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.863
in my father's workshop.

185
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.941
It was a tremendous childhood.

186
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.182
(downtempo jazz music)

187
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.588
My name is Martin Howard.

188
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.469
I've been collecting

189
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.830
from the 18805 and

190
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.180
I didn't want to collect
Swiss music boxes


191
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.187
or microscopes, or telescopes,

192
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.109
I wanted to collect something
that was sort of off the radar


193
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.186
in that regard.

194
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.947
The quality of how
things were built


195
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.584
at that time is spectacular.

196
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.226
Cast and machine made
part5 beautifully painted.


197
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.819
It's the wild west
of typewriters.


198
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.744
My collection I call the
Martin Howard collection.


199
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.222
They're all typewriters
of nonstandard design.


200
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.022
During the 18805 and 18905,

201
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.505
there were many different
styles of typewriters,


202
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.947
but there were two main
classes of typewriters.


203
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.823
One was the keyboard
typewriter and the other,


204
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.501
what we call are now
index typewriters.


205
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.940
I really love typewriters
that are the genesis


206
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.300
of an idea, the
very beginning form.


207
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.949
(click)

208
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.629
Even if it was a
failure down the road


209
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.388
and died out of the
evolutionary tree,


210
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.741
that's okay, I like the
beginning of any idea.


211
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.349
(ding)
(whirring)


212
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.268
(clicking)

213
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.267
One of the things I love
finding in my typewriters


214
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.428
when I'm working on
them is a dried spider,


215
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.588
a spider from the

216
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.021
What it tells me is that
nobody has raided the tomb


217
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.664
and I'm the first to crack
open this typewriter.


218
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.625
The only typewriter of
great historical note


219
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.582
that's missing
from my collection


220
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.350
is a Sholes and
Glidden typewriter.


221
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.864
The Sholes and
Glidden is the first


222
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.264
commercially
successful typewriter,


223
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.660
it appeared in 1874.

224
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.543
It's of the utmost
historical importance,


225
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:48.268
and after years of collecting,
it still eludes me.


226
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.826
(metal shifting)
(downtempo minimalist music)


227
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.506
(clinking)

228
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.865
(shuffling)

229
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.788
(clank)

230
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.748
- I feel like I'm just as
much a typewriter person


231
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:50.269
as anybody who actually likes
to see typewriters intact


232
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.064
it's just that I have a
different way of coming at it.


233
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.340
Some collectors,
typewriter enthusiasts,


234
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.706
don't like that I do this.

235
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.378
They get riled up as
if I'm going to destroy


236
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.549
thousands of typewriters and
that's not really the case.


237
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.423
Most of the ones
I take apart are


238
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.382
in pretty rough shape.

239
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.388
I don't really hack into
them, I'm pretty gentle


240
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.023
when I destroy them.

241
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.189
I'd always wanted to
take a typewriter apart


242
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.099
since I was 10 or 11.

243
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.665
My mom had an old
Underwood and I'd always


244
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.383
sit alongside of
it and hit the keys


245
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.382
and look at all the
machinery inside


246
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.986
and want to kind of be
in there and see it,


247
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.669
from the key getting
pushed to the


248
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.428
type bar hitting the platen.

249
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.858
Thought it was great.

250
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.425
Just couldn't get enough of it.

251
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.463
At the time, this
Queen video came out


252
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.305
with bits and pieces of
Fritz Lang's Metropolis.


253
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.421
That's kinda how the
typewriter looked to me,


254
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.190
it's like those little planes
flying through Metropolis.


255
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.028
When I looked inside, I
felt like I was flying


256
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.629
through the typewriter,

257
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.628
as if it were this
big city machine.


258
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.224
I've seen Metropolis more
times than I can count.


259
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.301
(grinding and rattling)

260
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.262
I moved to Oakland
three years ago


261
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.463
after living in the mountains
for almost 18 years.


262
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.467
I was living in the
woods, basically,


263
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.059
making what appeared
to be naked robots


264
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.783
out of machine parts.

265
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.100
And it didn't really go
over very well there.


266
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.941
I didn't know for
sure if it was good


267
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.186
or if it was worth looking at

268
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.341
or if it was worth
anybody's time.


269
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.984
So I had to come here to see.

270
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.703
(clanking)

271
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.502
A lot of it's my own compulsion,

272
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.827
my own need to make
art and be an artist.


273
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.580
When I first moved here,
I didn't really know anybody.


274
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.462
I was driving through
Berkeley one day


275
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.343
and I saw this sign with
a typewriter logo on it


276
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.939
that said California Typewriter
and I looked in the window.


277
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.750
Sure enough, there
were typewriters.


278
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.506
I'm always nervous to tell
people who like typewriters


279
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.545
about what I do, 'cause
some people don't like it.


280
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.429
But the Permillions
are super friendly and


281
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.389
they're like the first friends
I made when I got here.


282
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.380
- [Herb] Hey, hey,
what's up, Jer?


283
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.745
- Hey, Herb.

284
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:43.826
- [Ken] 15 that Jeremy, Herb?

285
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.906
Hey, what's up, buddy?

286
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.020
How you doin' man?

287
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.709
- [Jeremy] Alright.

288
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.662
Occasionally they'll
call me and ask me


289
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.545
if I have a certain part,
like a carriage return lever,


290
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.945
platen knobs, mainsprings.

291
00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.829
- [Jeremy] Really common parts
that I have boxes full of.


292
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.669
- This won't fly, but that's
the guy I need right there


293
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.065
so that one's gonna do
it, yeah that'll fit.


294
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.226
- I usually take 'em
all the way apart.


295
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.546
If I can give him any
kind of part that he needs


296
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.140
to put into a functioning
typewriter, I'm happy to do it.


297
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.544
It's pretty common actually.

298
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.099
You know, Smith
-Coronas?

299
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.222
Herb has a lot of
IBM Selectrics.


300
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.025
Some of them are just too
far gone, too hard to repair.


301
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.222
So he gives them to me
instead of throwing them away.


302
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.266
Thank you.

303
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.585
Thanks, Herb.

304
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.666
- [Herb] Alright, see you later.

305
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.859
- Catch you later.

306
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:33.866
(slams)

307
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.061
(whirring)

308
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.709
(wipers thunking)

309
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.588
- I feel like I've
been peripatetic
since I was an infant.


310
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.587
(distant thunder)

311
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:55.580
I basically grew up in the
backseat of a Plymouth.


312
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.900
I don't like flying.

313
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.748
I'd rather be in a car.

314
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.426
But it's really hard to write
a play when you're on the move


315
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.948
because you have
to focus, you know.


316
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.223
I feel my great strength
as a writer is being alone.


317
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.260
Aloneness is a
condition of writing.


318
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.587
You look at all the writers
that have come up with something


319
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.348
worth its own salt, you know,

320
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.586
and they're utterly alone.

321
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.781
All of 'em.

322
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.062
(shuffling paper)

323
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.988
The plays that really
bore me to death


324
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.626
are the ones in which the
writer's thinking all the time.


325
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:41.945
Causing the actors,
the characters to
speak for the author.


326
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.822
It's very boring

327
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.660
compared to a character
who speaks for himself.


328
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.863
There's a certain framework
of time that takes shape


329
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.822
around a play.

330
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.827
Sometimes you might fly
through a three act play.


331
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.590
You can write it
in a week or two.


332
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.907
And a one act play
might take you a year.


333
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.941
One of the keys to
leaving a piece of writing


334
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.623
and coming back to it

335
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.229
is to leave it at the
point where you know


336
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.183
it's about to go somewhere.

337
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.382
Don't come to a dead end
and stop and say oh my god,


338
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.302
you know, and walk away.

339
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.387
You'll come back, you're
gonna be in the same dead end


340
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.821
as you left it, you know.

341
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.669
I just never got along
with the computer screen.


342
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.660
And it's somehow removed
from the tactile experience.


343
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.701
When you go to ride a horse,
you have to saddle it,


344
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.708
whenever you use a typewriter,
you have to feed it paper.


345
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.707
There's a percussion about it.

346
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.698
You can see the ink flying
onto the surface of the paper.


347
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.504
So a letter will go,
pam, like that, but


348
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.703
along with it is the ink and
pshh, flying into the paper.


349
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.742
I'd rather ride a
horse than drive a car,


350
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.148
but that puts you in
a very different relationship


351
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.427
to the modern world, you know.

352
00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.821
(piano jazz music)

353
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.588
- [News Anchor] Well,
neither rain nor prices


354
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.582
prove to be obstacles for
Apple customers today,


355
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.345
who wanted to snap up the new
iPad on the very first day.


356
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.103
- [News Anchor] The rain
held off until 3:00 AM


357
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.380
along San Francisco's
Stockton Street.


358
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.348
One line was for customers
who had preordered


359
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.060
their new iPads online, another
was for those who hadn't.


360
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.498
- [News Anchor]
Throughout the morning,


361
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.382
we've been seeing this line here

362
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.660
at the downtown San Francisco
Apple Store growing.


363
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.509
Right now, it stretches
about half a block down Ellis


364
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.508
and continues to grow.

365
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.745
- [Carmen] Well,
things have been tough,


366
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.588
up and down all along.

367
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.100
We've had loans,
we've had second mortgages.


368
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.824
We've had all our
credit cards maxed out


369
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.783
just to keep the
business rolling.


370
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.788
When you like what you do, you
can almost get paid peanuts


371
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.504
and if you can get by
on peanuts, it's fine.


372
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.785
- This is a Hermes,
made in Switzerland.


373
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.742
Early 605.

374
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.224
My oldest son found it in a

375
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.428
swap meet somewhere
in California.


376
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.746
And it was in
fairly rough shape,


377
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.747
we had to kind of rebuild it.

378
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.384
I mean, some people who
knew what they were doing


379
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.343
rebuilt it, you know. (chuckles)

380
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.745
It's a beautiful typewriter
and it feels great.


381
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.787
And of all the manual
typewriters I have,


382
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.588
it has the greatest feel.

383
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.702
Just in the keys,
there's a little way they


384
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.510
cup your fingers.

385
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.820
I mean, this is as
good as it gets.


386
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.464
(quiet rattling)

387
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.827
There's the whole
deal right there.


388
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.258
So simple

389
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.301
and complex.

390
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.384
(light piano jazz music)
(soft clicks)


391
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.103
(whirring)

392
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.339
- [Ken] You know, it's
almost like you're a kid


393
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.949
working on your bicycle.

394
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.981
You can see what's
happening with it.


395
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.703
The lever goes up,
the carriage moves,


396
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.821
the letter leaves its mark.

397
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.549
You just can't get that
kind of fascination


398
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.229
out of a piece of
electronic equipment.


399
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.703
- [News Anchor] The
magic moment came at 8:00


400
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.303
when the doors opened.

401
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.307
(applause)

402
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.427
- Unfairly well known
for standing next to


403
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.468
new technology and finding
a way to incorporate it


404
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.069
into what I'm doing.

405
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.989
I was onstage several
years with Steve Jobs,


406
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.499
introducing Apple
software and hardware.


407
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.302
I mean they would come to
my house and show me stuff


408
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.863
and it would be mind-blowing
and I would say,


409
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.345
oh, I can't wait to use this.

410
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.303
For me, I feel like the
next step in technology


411
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.422
is less about what you're using

412
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.586
and more about how
you're using it.


413
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.664
In between my second
and third record,


414
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.901
I went to the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame.


415
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.819
And I saw all these great,
classic seminal songs


416
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.986
that were written on
hotel paper, or you know,


417
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.782
whatever paper was around.

418
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.867
I mean, you can see
right into their ideas.


419
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.745
You can see who scratched
out a lot of ideas and


420
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.987
which ideas came to
people really quickly.


421
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.703
And I thought to myself, wow,

422
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.025
I don't have any
representation of this.


423
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.828
I have hard drives, you know.

424
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.588
And you think to yourself,
you always have it


425
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.621
it's on a hard drive,
but I've never gone back


426
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.542
to any hard drive
that I've saved.


427
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.229
Ever.

428
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.625
And said, oh, let me
dig this thing up.


429
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.904
It's sort of like
a high concept trash,
in a weird way, you know.


430
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.702
It's like a trash with
this weird sort of promise


431
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.861
that you can still always
get it, but you won't.


432
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.140
And I realized,
I have nothing to prove


433
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.339
that I've written the
stuff that I've written.


434
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.347
There's no...

435
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.824
You can't see how I came up
with the stuff, there's no...


436
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.429
You can't touch it, you know.

437
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.069
So I started saying,

438
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.386
I just want documentation
of my writing.


439
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.541
Then I remembered seeing

440
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.388
Don't Look Back,
you know that great


441
00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.859
Pennebaker documentary
on Bob Dylan.


442
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.947
And there's this scene where
he's just sitting there,


443
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.868
he's kinda playing
the typewriter.


444
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.549
It's almost as much of
a musical instrument


445
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.468
as the harmonica or
the guitar is for him.


446
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.945
And he's kinda in his own
world, and there's the requisite


447
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.340
ashtray with a whole bunch of
smoldering cigarettes in it.


448
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.148
And I just sort of
love the idea of


449
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.988
even if you're Bob Dylan,
you still have to sit


450
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.103
at this altar to sort
of produce something.


451
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.021
See what that's all about.

452
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.987
(grinding peeling)

453
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.580
I got my typewriter at some
online office superstore.


454
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.860
They're like $120 and
you get everything in it.


455
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.981
You plug and play
and it's ready to go.


456
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.828
It just makes me think
there's probably like


457
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.543
four or five of them
in the warehouse


458
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:28.865
and every time

459
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.469
they ship one out, it's like,

460
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.388
someone at Brother
gets pissed off


461
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.342
that they have to keep the
Service Department open


462
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.983
for that much longer, 'cause
someone else bought one.


463
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.186
(clicking)

464
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.382
I instantly started to
really come alive on it.


465
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.778
And I realized the
reason that I was able


466
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.622
to come alive on the typewriter,

467
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.424
where I wasn't using
a computer or even a pen,


468
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.461
was that you were at
sort of a safe distance


469
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.262
where you can express
yourself openly


470
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.826
without having to edit
yourself at the same time.


471
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.858
And so it became this sort of
like confessional for me where


472
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.822
I would sit and just type.

473
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.625
And the reason that I was
able to go deeper into an idea


474
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.263
is because I wasn't
stopped anywhere


475
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.502
in that writing by
a red squiggly line.


476
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.508
And what is spell
check or grammar check


477
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.268
if all you're really
trying to do is sort of dig


478
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.381
into this sort of
mercurial sort of world


479
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.023
of what your ideas are.

480
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.022
So if you're trying to say,

481
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.988
close your eyes
and clone yourself,


482
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.265
build your heart and army,

483
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.347
and you spell army wrong.

484
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.943
Well, now you feel sort of
obligated to fix the word army,


485
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.141
and while you're
fixing the word army,


486
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.939
you've now completely lost
the tack on being a whacko


487
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.788
in what you're writing.

488
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.062
So what I would do is
I would sit at my counter


489
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.022
in my apartment in New York

490
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.869
and I would type
out three pages.


491
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.822
Sometimes it would
be before I went out,


492
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.066
sometimes it would
be after I went out.


493
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:55.058
And I never read 'em back
until I got to the studio.


494
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.859
If this were in Microsoft Word,
I'd never see these again.


495
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.823
some of which made the records.

496
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.100
Obviously, most of
which didn't, but


497
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.107
you can see me sort of
fighting for this song


498
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.629
called Queen of California.

499
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.742
(strumming folk chords)

500
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.543
"When I die,
I'm coming back as colors,


501
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.069
"the Queen of
California's on the line.


502
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.101
"I've got five
free days and a..."


503
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.783
Wait a minute, "I've got five
free days before I go away."


504
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.264
"I hear the Queen of
California needs a man


505
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.698
"to start a new life in the sun.

506
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.343
"I'm chasing the sun.

507
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.262
"I gotta find the
Queen of California.


508
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.869
"I hear the Queen of California
lives up there in the sun,


509
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.549
"took a while to get it through.

510
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.502
"There's nothing she
can do to me now."


511
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.940
It's like, and it's almost
kind of artistic, sort of.


512
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.186
Even when it is spelled
completely wrong.


513
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.386
It's almost what
thoughts look like.


514
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.581
You know, the sort of
stop and start of it.


515
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.145
"Never has a man this
alone felt this alive


516
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.147
"Never has a man so
alone felt so alive,"


517
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.739
it's like trying
to get the wording.


518
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.349
"Never is a phone so dead

519
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.142
"at the side of my bed

520
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.102
"Haven't charged it in 36 hours.

521
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.459
"Searching for the sun
that Neil Young hung


522
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.501
"after the gold rush in '71."

523
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.178
A lyric that actually made
it into Queen of California.


524
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.062
"They must have switched
it for a different one,


525
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.828
"'cause it's some new
kind of digital light."


526
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.019
Well, you know.

527
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.299
(strumming light melody)

528
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.262
All stream of consciousness.

529
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.665
And that's the thing, I can't
get to stream of consciousness


530
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.145
when I'm involved in my
own editorial process


531
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.659
as I'm trying to be a whacko.

532
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.144
You know, I'm trying to
be an absolute whack job


533
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.142
when I'm typing, but it's like,

534
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:20.982
the typewriter doesn't
judge you, it just goes,


535
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.743
right away, sir.

536
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.861
Right away sir, however
you want it to be.


537
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.019
- [Ken] They do
talk to you, yeah.


538
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.186
They talk to you.

539
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.505
I didn't think a machine
would talk to you,


540
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.746
but they actually do.

541
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.026
(minimalist piano music)

542
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.188
- One of the odd things about
the end of the 19th century


543
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.950
is you have this 30
year period or so,


544
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.108
where all of the major forms
of electromechanical media


545
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.301
are invented and more or
less at the same time,


546
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.223
we get the final form of the
typewriter, motion pictures.


547
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.949
telegraphy, all this stuff
sort of happens at once.


548
00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.186
The other thing that
was happening in
America at that moment


549
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.546
was there was this
interest in spiritualism,


550
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.220
and sÃ©ances, and table
tapping, and poltergeists,


551
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.261
and all of those
kinds of things.


552
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.945
It's a moment in history when
death is a lot more present


553
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.624
than it is now.

554
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.708
You could send a telegram
to someone and, you know,


555
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.508
it might take a couple
of weeks to get to them


556
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.940
and by the time they receive it,

557
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.347
either you might be dead
or they might be dead.


558
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.302
It was a pretty natural
question to ask,


559
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.347
well, with all of these
new forms of media,


560
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.421
is there any way that we
can receive communications


561
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:37.983
from the dead?

562
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.664
In a weird kind of way,
typewriting is haunted.


563
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.704
There's this sense that the
writing somehow comes to you


564
00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.309
through the machine.

565
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.020
Someone or something gives
you something to type


566
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.539
and the machine
kind of mediates it.


567
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.109
Is the typewriter
pulling the strings


568
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.824
and making the
author do the work?


569
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.469
The typewriter has to be working

570
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.826
almost before thinking
starts happening.


571
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.784
Once that process gets going,
it's like a little machine.


572
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.265
The writing comes out of it, but

573
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.944
the question of cause and
effect is a lot more tricky


574
00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.300
than you might first imagine.

575
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.500
- I don't ever feel nervous
that the words won't come.


576
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.666
This, this is beautiful.

577
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.349
'Cause I don't feel like
I'm in control of it


578
00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.824
most of the time.

579
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.508
(clicking)

580
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.543
I just trust there will
be words that come.


581
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.308
And thankfully there
always have been,


582
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.865
and I hope that it continues.

583
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:56.866
I often think about
what I do as counseling,


584
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.743
because people come to
me with some big stuff.


585
00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.668
I write a lot of
poems about death


586
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.701
and about people who've died.

587
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.583
I wrote a poem for a man
who had lost his wife


588
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.339
three months ago and they'd
been married for 43 years.


589
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.543
And when he made his request,
he could barely talk.


590
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.344
Somebody's desire
for words sometimes


591
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.666
is a desire for something more.

592
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.180
(minimalist piano music)

593
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.229
A man had gone to the
Golden Gate Bridge to jump


594
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.944
and was saved by the police.

595
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.501
that was about his secret
nobody in his life knew.


596
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.864
I was so grateful to him
for unloading it on me.


597
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.825
If you were to ask
me to speak a poem,


598
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.588
I couldn't do it,
but if you put me


599
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.587
in front of a
typewriter, it happens.


600
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.860
It's like maybe that's one
of the reasons I never allow


601
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.022
anybody else to use
this particular machine.


602
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:07.183
My typewriter is like the
truest love of my life.


603
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.142
- That is clean.

604
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.387
- There's something about
it that is so built well.


605
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.388
And if you care for it, it's
just gonna keep working.


606
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.860
I do worry that some day
there might not be somebody


607
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.298
who knows how to fix it.

608
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.585
(clicking)

609
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:25.022
(downtempo festive piano)

610
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.983
- [Jeremy] Once a month,
there's a flea market in Alameda


611
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.988
at the old naval base.

612
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.828
People come from all
over the Bay Area,


613
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.509
it's mostly antiques

614
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.429
and they have a
ton of typewriters.


615
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.789
Herb and I will go,

616
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.383
and we're both lookin'
for the same thing.


617
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.386
- How much is your typewriter?

618
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.420
- [Seller] $75.

619
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.426
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.665
- She's pretty.

621
00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:48.979
- [Herb] Yeah, not bad.

622
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.703
- How much is it?
- $75.


623
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.418
- Nah, that's too much.
- Yes, absolutely.


624
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.939
- [Jeremy] I'm looking
for typewriters that


625
00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.378
I can take apart.

626
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.586
- I had people
stoppin' by the shop,


627
00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.303
they're just hustlers, you know.

628
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.665
Had a bunch of typewriters
and other stuff,


629
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.861
they had like 15 Selectrics.

630
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.628
If you need a
couple more, just...


631
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.582
- Alright.

632
00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.781
- Yeah, 'cause I've been
turning 'em down, honestly.


633
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.059
- [Jeremy] Herb's
looking for something


634
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.902
that he can make a little nicer,

635
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.704
or something that's
already pretty immaculate.


636
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.821
An L.C. Smith.

637
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.622
That's sold.

638
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.549
So we help each other
spot all the typewriters.


639
00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.459
Ooh, a Clipper.

640
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.663
We're both looking for a deal,

641
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.662
which is harder to
get these days because


642
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.468
there's so many more people
interested in typewriters


643
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.780
than there were

644
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.979
- Not exactly.

645
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.664
- [Jeremy] How much?

646
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:41.939
- [Herb] $75 for that Clipper

647
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.378
and that Underwood was...

648
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.506
- [Jeremy] How
much was that one?


649
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.109
- [Herb] That was $68.

650
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:48.028
- [Jeremy] I don't
see many of those.


651
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.382
- I got about two or three
of 'em already in line.


652
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.148
- And what are those worth?

653
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.029
- $200, $300 bucks, somewhere
in that neighborhood.


654
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.749
Catch the right party,

655
00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.508
maybe you could go a
little more than that.


656
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.825
You can put some
rubber parts on it


657
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.868
and a wash job on it and hey.

658
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.499
Yeah, if I get desperate and
can't find anything else,


659
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.508
I might come back to it.

660
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.019
Ooh, how much your...
- Typewriter?


661
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.140
- Yes.
- $150.


662
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.702
- [Herb] Oh, okay.

663
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.946
Maybe we could negotiate a
little bit like that on there?


664
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.548
and she paid a lot
for it out of a job.


665
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.547
- Hmm.

666
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.149
Know anything about
whether it works or not?


667
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.389
(clicking)
(blues music)


668
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.626
Yeah, definitely
needs some attention.


669
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.900
(chuckles)

670
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.981
(clicks)

671
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.385
I'll take it.

672
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.747
- [Jeremy] That's a good one.

673
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.708
- Had it been any color but red,

674
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.544
I'd have passed right by it
for $150, I guarantee you that.


675
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.229
Red is sort of a hot color

676
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:59.582
and it's an easy, easy
mover so to speak.


677
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.548
Let's rock and roll.

678
00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.099
(blues music)

679
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.028
(appreciative noises)

680
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.061
- Yeah, it seems
a little touchy up there.


681
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.948
(clicking)

682
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.941
- Yeah, no, I feel something
for these machines.


683
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.345
I'll look at 'em and
my mind just goes


684
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.541
where has this machine been at?

685
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:27.026
If it could talk, man
could it tell some stories.


686
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.862
You never know where these
typewriters come from.


687
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.782
You know, they come
from all over the world.


688
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.579
One could've been in some famous
person's library somewhere


689
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.502
halfway across the
world and now it made it


690
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.383
to this shop over
here in Berkeley.


691
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.140
- Christopher Latham Sholes
is a very interesting man.


692
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.625
He was an editor, a
publisher, and for a while


693
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.900
he was a state senator.

694
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.907
He was also a keen inventor.

695
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.624
And in Milwaukee, a few
years after the Civil War,


696
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.627
he invented his typewriter.

697
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.105
(oompah music)

698
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.221
'Scuse me sir, can
I ask you a question.


699
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.627
I'm looking for the location
of the historical plaque


700
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.264
that talks about the
invention of the typewriter,


701
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.223
somewhere nearby I believe.

702
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.785
(oompah music)

703
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.622
"At 318 Sate Street,

713
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.698
(cars whooshing)

714
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.667
I've come to Milwaukee
to get my hands


715
00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.349
on a Sholes and Glidden.

716

(click)

717
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.703
To be able to get
close to the source


718
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:41.941
of the very first typewriter

719
00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.426
is something I've dreamed
about for a long time.


720
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:52.107
Today, perhaps, there are only

721
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.265
Good morning.

722
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.023
So nice to meet you.

723
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.345
- Hi, good to meet you.
- It's wonderful.


724
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.739
Many of those are in museums,

725
00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.669
a few are held in private hands.

726
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:04.749
This has been a pilgrimage
I've wanted to make for years.


727
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.827
I would love to be able to have

728
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.986
one of these typewriters
in my own collection.


729
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.629
- Oh, I want one of those.

730
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.149
I want one of those, Al.

731
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.743
To be able to explore it.

732
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.747
- This has been in the
museum since probably


733
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.708
just after World War I.

734
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.349
- [Martin] And really have
a sense that my collection


735
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.188
has become complete
at that point,


736
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.142
even though I don't have
all the typewriters.


737
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:26.308
But that would really give
me a sense of completion.


738
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.785
(light piano music)

739
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.060
Many efforts had been
made since the 17005,


740
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.785
by various inventors, to
create a typewriting machine.


741
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.949
But they all ended in failure
with very few being produced.


742
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.587
But Christopher Latham
Sholes's place in history


743
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.782
is marked by what he did in
Kleinsteuber's machine shop,


744
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:50.460
beginning at 1867 and
the six difficult years


745
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.786
that followed to create
the world's first


746
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.379
commercially
successful typewriter.


747
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.581
The initial efforts used
a piano type keyboard.


748
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.462
What you're really
kind of looking at here


749
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.822
is just a man's ideas in
how to get the mechanics


750
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.339
of the fingers making
type to the mechanics


751
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.427
of getting it on
a piece of paper.


752
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.467
The lower is the back
half of the alphabet


753
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.905
and the upper keys would've
been the front half


754
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.987
of the alphabet.

755
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.263
Sholes and his team made
around 50 to 60 prototypes


756
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.068
and at the end of
those six years,


757
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.700
he ended up with a
working wooden typewriter.


758
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.548
Is this written by Sholes?

759
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.540
- [Scholar] It is from Sholes.

760
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.149
- Wow.

761
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.103
- Typewritten.
- Touching history here.


762
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.824
"I think the machine is now
as perfect in its mechanism


763
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.742
"as I know how to make it.

764
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.221
"I know of no respect in
which I can improve it.


765
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.661
"The machine is done and I want
some more worlds to conquer.


766
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.868
"Life will be most flat,
stale, and unprofitable


767
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.981
"without something to invent.

768
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.339
"Yours, etc.,

769
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.268
"Sholes."

770
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:58.586
The wooden prototype met
with rejection right away.


771
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.668
They took it to half a dozen
different manufacturers


772
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.509
whom all declined to
manufacture the typewriter.


773
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.178
Then someone suggested that
they take the typewriter


774
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.068
to Remington and Sons.

775
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.868
Now, Remington and Sons
had been making weaponry


776
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.346
for the Civil War and
with the Civil War over,


777
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.542
they were looking for new
things to manufacture.


778
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.866
Remington and Sons took
this wooden prototype


779
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.466
and they spent the next year
turning it into a metal machine


780
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:26.059
that was much more
reliable, and durable,


781
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.545
and could be mass
produced by them.


782
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.781
And the first Sholes
and Glidden typewriters


783
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.584
appeared on the market in 1874.

784
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.309
May I push a
key and get a feel?

785
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.387
I've never done this
before, by the way,


786
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.222
I've never actually pushed
a key on a Sholes and Glidden.


787
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.545
- Yes, give it a try.

788
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:41.660
- That's fine?

789
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:42.905
Gonna push the J there.

790
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.783
(soft clack)

791
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.458
That's wonderful.

792
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:52.026
$125 was a lot of money to
put out for this machine,


793
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.943
especially as nobody
could type and nobody knew


794
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.704
the benefits of what
a typewriter could offer.


795
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.343
(melancholy horn)

796
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.542
Of great significance
was the appearance


797
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.263
of the first Qwerty keyboard

798
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.507
on this Sholes and
Glidden typewriter.


799
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.223
If you look at the keyboard,

800
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.864
the top row, left to
right, says Qwerty.


801
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.745
- There is endless debate
about how that order


802
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.508
came into being.

803
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.945
Some say that all of
the letters in the word


804
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.859
typewriter are on the
first line of keys.


805
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.265
So a salesman who was
trying to demonstrate


806
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.387
the benefits of this
wonderful new machine


807
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.865
to prospective customers
could whack out the word


808
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.662
typewriter very, very quickly.

809
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.067
Without having to be
particularly proficient.


810
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.982
When the Sholes and
Glidden came out,


811
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.948
it was not well received,
people didn't understand


812
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.420
what a typewriter could offer.

813
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.905
They only sold 1,000 units.

814
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.142
Sholes was very disappointed

815
00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.866
and he sold all his remaining
shares in the company.


816
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.982
The Remington Two typewriter,
coming out in 1878


817
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:59.978
was really the turning point
for this revolutionary machine.


818
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.227
Within a few short years,
all hell would break loose.


819
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.900
By the mid-18905, there
were as many as 60


820
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.670
typewriter manufacturers,
not just in America


821
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:10.985
but also in Europe.

822
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.340
And the sales had taken off.

823
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.265
- Two Royals,

824
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.986
The last of 'em.

825
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.743
Most of the machines that
we repair are approximately


826
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.588
40 to 50 years old.

827
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.382
The companies that
made the machines


828
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.378
and supplied the parts,
they are long gone.


829
00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.058
Ames supply company was
the last of the companies


830
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:37.149
that supplied us with parts
for a lot of the typewriters.


831
00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.386
Their primary thing was to
take old typewriter platens


832
00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:42.024
and recover them, resurface 'em.

833
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.266
We got a letter last week
saying that after 110 years


834
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.780
in operation, Ames
Supply Company was
going out of business.


835
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.582
(rattling)

836
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.339
- My dad, he's very good
at solving problems.


837
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.347
He could look at it,
and figure it out,


838
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.700
and solve it within minutes.

839
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.026
And that's something you gotta
appreciate with my father


840
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.023
that you just don't
find that nowadays.


841
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.067
It's a lost art.

842
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.023
- It's not the
right consistency.


843
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:10.380
That's actually pretty
close in diameter on it.


844
00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.069
- Pops, he loves all this.

845
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.340
This has been his life
ever since I was born


846
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.063
and he stayed with it.

847
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.067
- Yeah, so like 9.5
right from the end.


848
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.783
- He told me if you wanna do
something, do it all the way,


849
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.742
but make sure you enjoy it.

850
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:25.420
Like don't halve anything,
go 100% and make sure you like


851
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.069
what you're doing.

852
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.669
- See if you can slide
that one in there,


853
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:29.939
I don't know if
it's a lot easier.


854
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.185
Go ahead and get the copper.

855
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:32.704
- [Son] And he showed me that.

856
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.664
- [Ken] Put a
little soap on that.


857
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.588
- [Son] I'm here, tryin'
to help my dad out, man.


858
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.223
- [Ken] You get that?

859
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.465
Oh, yeah, that's
going on, isn't it.


860
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.659
Then grind it.

861
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.143
(metallic whirring)

862
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.421
I think what the typewriter
symbolizes to me is America.


863
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.780
I think that might work.

864
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.949
American hard work, what
this country was based on.


865
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.108
Made by us with our own
hands to help us out


866
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.302
but not to spoil us and
not to make us complacent.


867
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.229
(clicking)

868
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.109
- I think that much
of the joy of life


869
00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.148
can come and should
come from work.


870
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.987
I think we've been sold
a certain bill of goods


871
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.141
about ease and happiness

872
00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.148
being necessarily synonymous.

873
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.146
They aren't.

874
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.669
Something goes out of
the human experience,


875
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:44.143
when life is made progressively
easier, less complicated.


876
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:49.549
Less demanding of
alertness, effort,


877
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.345
and appreciation of
work when it's done.


878
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.107
There was once a typewriter
that was standing alone


879
00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.910
on a shelf in an old store
in White Plains, New York,


880
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.140
nobody paying much
attention to it at all.


881
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.824
That's the beginning
of the story.


882
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:09.386
Then along came...

883
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:13.822
In 1965, when I was starting
to work on my first book,


884
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.459
feeling that I needed
something more substantial


885
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.901
to work on than a
portable typewriter.


886
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:24.979
I went and bought a secondhand,
Royal Standard typewriter.


887
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.183
And I probably paid $25 for it.

888
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.267
Got it in White Plains, New York

889
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.189
and I've been using
it all these years.


890
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:38.463
Almost every day, written
everything I have written on it


891
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.786
and there's nothing
wrong with it.


892
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:45.825
It's a magnificent example of
superb American manufacturing.


893
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.469
People tell me that I
could do much better,


894
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.423
I could go faster, and
have less to contend with


895
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.224
if I were to use a
computer, a word processor.


896
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.943
But I don't wanna go faster.

897
00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.222
If anything, I would
prefer to go slower.


898
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.307
To me, it's understandable.

899
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.343
I press the key, and
another key comes up


900
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.780
and prints a letter
on a piece of paper.


901
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:10.742
And then you can pull it out,

902
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.101
it's a piece of paper upon which
you have printed something.


903
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.222
You've made that, it's tangible.

904
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.220
It's real.

905
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:22.826
I think the tool
of the typewriter,


906
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.544
because it is more difficult,

907
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:29.026
produces for me a better result.

908
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.979
(birds chirping)

909
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.903
I work virtually
all day, every day.


910
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.904
I come out after breakfast
and I work until lunchtime


911
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.466
and then I go in, get a
bite to eat, come back out,


912
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.388
work for the rest of the day.

913
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.026
Now I'm not typing, not
writing on the typewriter


914
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.822
all that time.

915
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:52.782
If you were to walk by
in the field behind there


916
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.389
and you looked in the window,

917
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:56.427
you'd think, well that
guy's just sitting


918
00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.743
in there daydreaming, but an
awful lot of the process is


919
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:01.939
just thinking.

920
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.701
- There are a lot of
fractals in nature.


921
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:12.788
Mysterious geometry that
exists in everything.


922
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.869
(clanking)
I see the same shapes


923
00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.668
inside the typewriter.

924
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.906
I like to pull out the
shapes that I feel resemble


925
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.146
parts of the anatomy.

926
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.865
Sometimes a part dictates
that it be surface anatomy,


927
00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.187
sometimes it's a bone,
skeletal anatomy.


928
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.348
Sometimes it's a
little mixture of both.


929
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.623
When I take the
typewriters apart,


930
00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.060
I don't see this
unnatural object.


931
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.540
I see people, I see us in them.

932
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:54.939
Very often, near
the platen knobs,


933
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.543
there's a spot where
someone's finger


934
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.264
has rubbed across the carriage.

935
00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.348
And it's this one nice,
shiny, polished spot


936
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.065
with a little bit of dirt
and oil from the fingers.


937
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.346
I like that kind of

938
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.188
thing that's left
on the typewriter.


939
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:15.066
I can say that there's
probably that person's DNA.


940
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:18.342
It's fun to see those
traces of people.


941
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.905
It's such an emotional machine.

942
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.624
A lot of memories and
a lot of real people


943
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:30.381
put themselves on a piece
of paper through a machine.


944
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:32.581
And I understand all that.

945
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.460
This is how I choose to
appreciate the typewriter,


946
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.902
by dissecting it and bringing
out the little bits and pieces


947
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.988
that are us in them.

948
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.385
So my favorite stuff to
do is the human figures,


949
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.309
because I find every
curve on the human body


950
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.707
in here somewhere, in
one of these typewriters.


951
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:59.664
And I like to try to
put those together.


952
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:04.421
I do that with pins
and springs and nuts.


953
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:07.349
I don't use anything apart
from what's in the typewriter.


954
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.422
I have learned how
to match the parts


955
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:13.586
to the corresponding
part in the human body,


956
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.429
just by, you know, play

957
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:19.098
and putting the
parts together and,


958
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:22.347
oh, you look like
a leg, or you know.


959
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.828
A very childlike way of just
having a dialogue with parts.


960
00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.581
(rattling)

961
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:39.100
I grew up in northern Minnesota
on the Mesabi Iron Range.


962
00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.301
I lived in a lot of trailers.

963
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.427
My dad never made
a lot of money.


964
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:48.186
He never had any
desire to buy a house.


965
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.900
I left there probably two
days after I graduated.


966
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.021
I wanted to get out

967
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.544
and now I'm in a trailer again.

968
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.899
(chucang)

969
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.463
It's kinda crazy.

970
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.989
As a kid, deer were everywhere.

971
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.181
There were times when my dad
was laid off from the railroad


972
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.789
and we were eating
Campbell's soup,


973
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.227
peanut butter from
the jar, and venison.


974
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.781
When I moved down to Oakland,

975
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:20.107
one of the first sculptures
that I made was the deer.


976
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.460
I had always told
myself I would make one.


977
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.508
(ambient indie music)

978
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.500
I've taken this deer
across the Bay Bridge


979
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:36.588
about six times back and forth.

980
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:39.907
I've shown it at
galleries, art exhibitions.


981
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:44.428
I don't like for
work to sit around


982
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:49.579
and taunt me with the failure
of not being able to sell it.


983
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:54.380
I'm a bit ambivalent about
the whole gallery scene.


984
00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.228
Trying to work as an artist
and then sell my work


985
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:59.547
through a gallery has been
exceedingly difficult.


986
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.430
It's hard to take a
piece that I worked on


987
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.865
for maybe as much as a year,

988
00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.788
to sell it for not
a lot of money,


989
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.550
and then only get half of
that not a lot of money.


990
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:13.103
So just two weeks?

991
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:15.743
Oh okay.

992
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.622
The best way for me to
do this for a living


993
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.459
is to take on the
promotion myself.


994
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.820
And the internet
makes it really easy,


995
00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.379
just takes me a
couple hours a day.


996
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.388
I have just about every
social networking profile


997
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:30.943
that you can imagine.

998
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:32.583
I try to show a little

999
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:34.542
of what the studio
looks like every day


1000
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.503
with images of my process
while I'm working on a piece.


1001
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.548
People can email me directly
and I manage to get enough work


1002
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:43.543
to almost pay the bills.

1003
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.350
(engine rumbling)

1004
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:52.349
(guitar strumming)
(crowd chatter)


1005
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:57.388
- [Ken] When I was a kid,
about 19, 20 years old


1006
00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.820
got a job workin' in Berkeley.

1007
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.590
It's like the whole world
opened up to me over here.


1008
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:05.020
Different kind of people,
different kind of cultures.


1009
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:08.068
I really found myself wanting
to go to work every day.


1010
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:13.262
It lets you see the world
without going to see the world.


1011
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:16.030
You know, the world comes to
you in this city over here.


1012
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:17.583
The first time I
heard a black guy


1013
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.149
with a British accent
it blew me away.


1014
00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:20.988
(piano tinkling)

1015
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.662
(downtempo jazz music)

1016
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:43.625
The store is open five
days a week, 12 to 5.


1017
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.743
Couple years ago, it was
only open three days a week.


1018
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:51.863
It's picking up, but
it's just not there yet.


1019
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.021
It's just enough
to keep us going,


1020
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.427
but not enough to keep
me going. (chuckles)


1021
00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:01.100
(jazz music)

1022
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.023
I'm just hoping that
things'll turn around.


1023
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:06.664
Herb and I, we have the
skills, the experience.


1024
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.781
We have all the knowledge
of doing this, we just need


1025
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.423
customers.

1026
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.422
(clicking)
- Wait, wait wait, I wanna.


1027
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:14.547
(clicking)

1028
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.627
- Linus, you broke, it's ripped.

1029
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:17.660
- No I didn't.

1030
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:18.859
- Yeah.

1031
00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.106
- It was already ripped.

1032
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:24.581
- One good thing
about them is that


1033
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.669
you don't have to turn
them on or plug them in.


1034
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:33.660
I used to have a PC, but I
did not like my PC one bit.


1035
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.668
- There is a wonderful
way to spend time typing.


1036
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:40.468
You get to think about it.

1037
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:43.104
You get to romantically
sit back and ponder


1038
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:45.580
what your next words
are going to be


1039
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.903
and that is a pleasant,
tactile action.


1040
00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:52.385
It actually turns
writing or composing


1041
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:57.704
into a very specific,
physical process


1042
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.866
that has a soundtrack to it.

1043
00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:00.900
Listen to this one.

1044
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:02.862
(chunking)

1045
00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:04.662
See, hear that heavy chunk
that you hear right there.


1046
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:05.700
Smith Corona, now.

1047
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:06.945
(clacking)

1048
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:08.703
Little muted, a little softer.

1049
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:09.899
And now hear the Olympia.

1050
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.549
(clicking)

1051
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.218
Crisp, a little solid
report that comes out.


1052
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:18.469
That, to me, is a good,
solid work of art.


1053
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.706
(clicking)

1054
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.389
- It's really exciting
to come into a shop where


1055
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:27.740
you're surrounded by all
these great typewriters


1056
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.828
and your mind reels at
the different sounds


1057
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:32.509
that they can make.

1058
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:37.466
Certain typewriters,
you may discover sounds


1059
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:38.944
that you never heard before.

1060
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.788
(ding)

1061
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:42.423
It's hard to find a typewriter
with good bell tone.


1062
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:43.949
This bell isn't the loudest,

1063
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:46.744
but it's got the
best tone to it.


1064
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:49.464
This one, the whole case is...

1065
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.662
It doesn't articulate
on a lever.


1066
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:55.179
On better typewriters,
that bell should be loud,


1067
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:57.142
it should be clear.

1068
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.578
Now this one the bell is
kind of a more thuddy sound,


1069
00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.145
this one, it rings
really loudly.


1070
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.749
(chiming)

1071
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.708
This one has the best
bell of them all.


1072
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.781
It's hard to find a typewriter
where it's a quality sound


1073
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.628
and it can be consistently made.

1074
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:10.508
(dinging)

1075
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.310
(sustained chime)

1076
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:16.782
- We are the Boston
Typewriter Orchestra


1077
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:21.506
and we perform music
on old typewriters.


1078
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.501
Old, discarded typewriters.

1079
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.588
We're a collective and what
a shitty answer that was.


1080
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.384
(rhythmic clacking)

1081
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:30.500
(ding)

1082
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.940
(rhythmic clacking)

1083
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:34.145
(ding)

1084
00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:36.659
(rhythmic clacking)

1085
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:37.780
(ding)

1086
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:41.147
(rhythmic clacking)

1087
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:44.069
- One of the things we
sat down pretty early with


1088
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:47.421
in the BTO and decided, was that

1089
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.825
none of us were going to
try and quit our day jobs


1090
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:53.261
to make the BTO work
as a legitimate band.


1091
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.826
And that was sort of
a really liberating decision.


1092
00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:00.784
You know, make enough money
to keep us in typewriters,


1093
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.265
beer, the occasional pizza.

1094
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:07.503
(orchestral clicking
and dinging)


1095
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.579
(percussive clacking)

1096
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:16.781
We don't want to destroy these.

1097
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:18.582
We are using them
as an instrument.


1098
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:20.223
We are repurposing them,
(audience clapping)


1099
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.783
but our intent is
not to destroy it.


1100
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:24.669
(crowd cheering typocide)

1101
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:29.188
I murdered one and I have
to find a new typewriter.


1102
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:31.858
You feel like Pete
Townsend, I guess.


1103
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.469
He destroyed the guitar, like,

1104
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.109
shit, we'd better
get it signed fast


1105
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:37.949
so I can have another
guitar to destroy.


1106
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.584
I mean, I've killed
three typewriters now.


1107
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.860
Each one of them has
its own personality


1108
00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:44.549
and spirit and soul.

1109
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.183
- We had the two Smith Coronas

1110
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:47.988
that had a really nice
case slide on 'em.


1111
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:49.782
- Oh god, yeah.

1112
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:52.868
- And those two have
since become inoperable,


1113
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.788
in pieces.

1114
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:56.548
And there's an entire song
that we can't play now,


1115
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.819
because we haven't been able

1116
00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:59.628
to restock those two typewriters

1117
00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.343
to that specific mechanics
of the case slide.


1118
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:04.906
(melodic furious clanging)

1119
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:19.185
(ding)

1120
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:20.186
(rhythmic clacking)

1121
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:22.108
(ding)

1122
00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:25.268
- We spend a lot of time really
crafting all of our songs.


1123
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:26.863
- We do some covers.

1124
00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:30.346
We set up Gil Scott
-Heron's

1125
00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:32.427
The Revolution will
not be Televised


1126
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:34.939
and it's now the Revolution
will be Typewritten.


1127
00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.578
And we do a cover of...

1128
00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.940
- We're working on a
cover of Rain and Blood.


1129
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:41.265
That's Slayer.

1130
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:42.903
(rhythmic clacking)

1131
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:44.424
(ding)

1132
00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:51.420
(ticking)

1133
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:54.781
I was at somebody's
house years and years ago


1134
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:58.949
and saw, framed on the
wall, a thank you note


1135
00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.539
that Noel Coward had
written to somebody


1136
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:03.945
he had had lunch with.

1137
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:05.947
And this was in 1930-something.

1138
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.948
And I thought,

1139
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.061
Okay, Noel Coward actually
typed out on his typewriter


1140
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:13.619
and sent it to somebody,
has then lingered around,


1141
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:14.740
and then somebody bought
it at some auction


1142
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:16.508
or something like that.

1143
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.507
But that piece of
paper is still with us.


1144
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.508
And I think that that
is, deep down inside is,


1145
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:23.302
the interest that I have in it.

1146
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:26.070
Anybody with one of these
can create a document


1147
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.068
that will physically
last forever.


1148
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:30.942
And if the idea on
it is a good one,


1149
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:32.742
the idea can last forever, too.

1150
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:35.060
- Everybody knows the
feeling of having lost


1151
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:37.141
digital data.

1152
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:40.501
Nothing is worse than losing
digital data as a writer.


1153
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:42.661
I've never lost
something I've typed.


1154
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.623
10 years from now, is any
of the computers gonna read


1155
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:46.865
the stuff that we've saved?

1156
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:48.628
I have no idea.

1157
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:52.379
But this still absolutely
human compliant.


1158
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.989
It's human compatible.

1159
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:55.942
You don't have to
upgrade to look at it,


1160
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:58.186
you just have to make sure
it doesn't light on fire.


1161
00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:00.221
That's all you have to do.

1162
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:02.102
- I type over everything,
I don't bother with white out.


1163
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:04.301
I don't bother, I don't
try to correct it,


1164
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:06.148
I don't make multiple drafts.

1165
00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:07.624
If I make a mistake,
I just will maybe


1166
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:08.785
(clacking)

1167
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.748
X it out like that.

1168
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:12.708
- I think there's a
great value in mistakes.


1169
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:15.145
It's their value for history
and how things are made.


1170
00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:17.022
(birds chirping)

1171
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:19.460
You see the perfect
finished text of a speech


1172
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.099
that a president of the
United States makes.


1173
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:25.029
How much editing did the
President do on that?


1174
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:29.018
How much of his speech
was not written by him?


1175
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:33.348
Which words they changed, which
sentences they crossed out,


1176
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.347
that's extremely interesting.

1177
00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:38.018
You see, the process
of what it took to get


1178
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.545
to the finished result.

1179
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.422
With a computer,
no manuscript like that


1180
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.666
will be around anymore.

1181
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.384
Future historians are going
to have nothing to work with.


1182
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.662
There will be no diaries,
there will be no letters.


1183
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.826
So how will we know

1184
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:54.662
what they really thought?

1185
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.386
What the processes were?

1186
00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:00.228
(gramophone playing)

1187
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:02.102
- As the benefits of this
revolutionary machine


1188
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:04.904
became clear, there
was a real shortage


1189
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:06.862
of trained typists,
people did not know


1190
00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:08.901
how to operate them efficiently.

1191
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:13.149
The first typing school ever
opened in New York in 1881


1192
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:16.746
and it was at the YWCA,
there were six woman enrolled


1193
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.464
and it was a six month class.

1194
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:23.663
Every woman who was trained
to type got a job immediately.


1195
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:27.101
The type writer was what
the typist was called,


1196
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.744
so the woman was
the type writer.


1197
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.982
And there was this huge
groundswell for the first time


1198
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:36.307
of women entering into the
man's business environment.


1199
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:38.262
They were paid less than
men, but it was still


1200
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:40.142
a larger salary than
they had been paid


1201
00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:43.740
when they worked in factories
or as a school teacher.


1202
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:46.863
Sholes didn't get
any financial gain


1203
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.662
from success when it came,

1204
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:51.589
but he was very satisfied
that his invention


1205
00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.827
had provided new
opportunities for women.


1206
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.986
He saw it as a means
of emancipating women


1207
00:57:57.190 --> 00:58:00.341
and getting them into the
workplace in a new capacity.


1208
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.423
(patriotic music)

1209
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.268
If I could time travel,

1210
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:09.143
I'd love to go back to
Kleinsteuber's machine shop


1211
00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.659
and to see Sholes, I mean
to actually see him there,


1212
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.667
a breathing, living man.

1213
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.583
If I could've spoken to Sholes,

1214
00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:23.263
I would've shook his hand,

1215
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.904
I'd want to feel
his palm in my palm.


1216
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:32.780
I'd look him in the
eyes, see his face alive,


1217
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:34.582
not just a photograph.

1218
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:39.148
I'm not too sure what I'd say,

1219
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:41.460
there'd perhaps
be tears in my eyes.


1220
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:44.264
(patriotic music)

1221
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:53.465
I would suggest that we
have a beer together.


1222
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.269
I'd want to tell
Sholes a bit about


1223
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.062
what the 20th century was like,

1224
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:03.185
I'd wanna tell him a
bit about the computer,


1225
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:04.903
the personal computer.

1226
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.589
I'd want to tell Sholes

1227
00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:09.185
that the Qwerty
keyboard was still there


1228
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:13.019
(jazz music)

1229
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:14.345
- When typewriter manufacturers

1230
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:16.785
were designing the typewriter,

1231
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.187
they wanted to make
something sexy.


1232
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:22.102
Create something that
people could relate to


1233
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:24.306
and wanna put their fingers on.

1234
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:26.580
(clacking)

1235
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:30.984
I'd dreamed about
creating a woman.


1236
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:34.666
Like a full scale nude
woman for a long time.


1237
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.827
Something archetypal,

1238
00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:40.026
something that would show
the sensuality, the curves,


1239
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:43.108
and the lines that I found
in the typewriter parts.


1240
00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:44.743
Yeah, but not unnaturally.

1241
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:46.303
It's very difficult
to put things together


1242
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:48.978
in a way that
emulates real life.


1243
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:53.263
Just the right size.

1244
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:55.188
It's too sharp.

1245
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:57.904
In trying to create her beauty,

1246
00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:00.385
it's helping me bring out
the forms in the typewriter


1247
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:05.425
that I think are the most
beautiful and most sensual.


1248
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.780
I used a bell and a platen knob

1249
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:10.550
for the lips, because it has
the little vertical lines


1250
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.379
that look like the
cracks in the lips.


1251
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:16.785
Two of the ribbon spool
covers from a Royal


1252
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.861
get set up as the pelvis.

1253
01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:25.425
(clunking)

1254
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:29.908
One of the sexiest lines is the
curve of the pectoral muscle


1255
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.828
just above the breast,
and that exists


1256
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.463
in a lot of typewriters.

1257
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:37.100
Royals have those,
Olympia, Underwoods.


1258
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:39.266
They're suggesting breasts.

1259
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.662
When I'm in the
thick of creating,


1260
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:48.260
my body disappears,
physical pain disappears,


1261
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.540
and it's very meditative
in that I'm not thinking


1262
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:55.699
about the bills I have to pay
or what day of the week it is.


1263
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.629
I give that trance state
more time in my life


1264
01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.309
than any other time.

1265
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.262
Any money that I've
made doing this,


1266
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.030
that's what that all pays
for, is that time for me.


1267
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:06.583
Being in that state.

1268
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.498
- When I hit those trances,

1269
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.547
it's a very strange combination

1270
01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.827
of laying the pavement
and driving on it.


1271
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:18.544
- You're seeing a phenomenon,

1272
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.822
you're seeing this
apparition take place.


1273
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:25.102
I don't mean to sound
hocus pocus about it, but


1274
01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:28.467
there's something taking
place and you're true to that.


1275
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:31.025
- And you cannot decide when
those moments are gonna be,


1276
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:34.342
you just have to be there
in case they happen.


1277
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:36.347
But you have to keep
your heart rate down,


1278
01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:39.348
and focus, and stay
in that trance.


1279
01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:42.144
And just let that one
side of your brain create,


1280
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.910
and the other side of your
brain send it through.


1281
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:47.340
- And sometimes you see
it by leaps and bounds


1282
01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:49.461
and sometimes it's just static.

1283
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:54.027
You don't just write
it, you see it.


1284
01:01:54.230 --> 01:02:00.339
- The best creators in the
world are fiercely arrogant.


1285
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.706
And it's not the arrogance
that you normally think of.


1286
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:04.582
It's the arrogance

1287
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.826
in looking at something
you haven't created yet


1288
01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.702
and say, yes I have.

1289
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:11.060
- Sometimes it leads you
somewhere, sometimes it doesn't.


1290
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.584
You know.

1291
01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:15.862
But that's the
adventure of it all.


1292
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.901
- You create something
so you don't have to live


1293
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:21.028
with the reality that you
couldn't create something.


1294
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.380
It's sick, it's a
very sick process.


1295
01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.627
I'm going to create something
just so I don't have nothing.


1296
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:27.746
(ding)

1297
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:29.662
Doesn't make any sense.

1298
01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:38.384
(engine revving)
(horn honking)


1299
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.904
(distant siren)

1300
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:47.429
- Herb put the
building up for sale.


1301
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.063
You know, I didn't
wanna see him do it,


1302
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:51.909
I mean, he struggled
a lot to keep it goin'.


1303
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:56.422
And to see him put it up for
sale, I was kinda sad for him.


1304
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:59.349
We haven't heard anything
since the sign's been put up,


1305
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.620
but just a couple days
ago, got an inquire


1306
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.139
from a prospective buyer.

1307
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:07.422
After they left,
I talked to Herb and


1308
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.939
he seems to think the guys
are quite interested in it.


1309
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:14.428
If the shop gets sold,

1310
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:17.428
then I've gotta find
something else to do.


1311
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.819
So I'm kind of waiting to see

1312
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:20.503
what my next move is gonna be.

1313
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.339
I can't make a move
until they make one.


1314
01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:25.943
- [Candy] Dad mentioned that,

1315
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.708
he was really concerned
about payment.


1316
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:29.548
- Oh absolutely, he'd
have to give severance.


1317
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.149
- Oh definitely, you'd
have to give him something.


1318
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:32.743
Yeah, some kind of
package for sure.


1319
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:34.668
- Absolutely.
- And some kind of time.


1320
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:37.020
Some kind of warning,
I mean not 30 days, 60 days.


1321
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.908
- Well as long as it comes
with a reasonable check,


1322
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.380
it should help soften that blow.

1323
01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:42.625
- [Candy] We pay him
not enough, probably,


1324
01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:44.263
for what we get from him.

1325
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:46.062
- [Woman] That's
right, that's right.


1326
01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.828
- [Candy] For what he
takes on and does for us.


1327
01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:49.469
I think we owe him something,
what would you think?


1328
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:51.467
Fifteen years he's
been working for you.


1329
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:53.069
And 30 days' notice

1330
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:54.146
and no check,
I'm not feelin' it.


1331
01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:56.068
- No way.

1332
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:58.067
- I mean, he's gotta go
out and find a job now.


1333
01:03:58.270 --> 01:03:59.988
He's made it possible for dad
to not be there all the time


1334
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:01.942
and Carmen to not be there
all the time, actually.


1335
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:05.779
He would drop whatever he's
doing to come help Dad.


1336
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:08.265
(jazz trumpet)

1337
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.509
- [Ken] Today's
Herb's 70th birthday.


1338
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:15.541
I've fixed up a couple
of classic Royals


1339
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.669
that they're gonna use
to have people sign in.


1340
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:21.701
Lotta people are
from Herb's past.


1341
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:23.502
- Hey, remember this
move we used to do?


1342
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:25.348
(laughing)

1343
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:28.064
- [Ken] IBM days,
his old typewriter days.


1344
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:30.147
I think he's gonna
have a good time.


1345
01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:31.419
(click)

1346
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:33.939
(crowd chatter and laughter)

1347
01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:37.500
- [Speaker] Happy to celebrate

1348
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:38.785
- [Man] Amen.

1349
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:40.423
- I wanna share one thing.

1350
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:42.865
God had given us
two commandments,


1351
01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:45.538
one is to love him with
everything that we have,


1352
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.741
and the second is to
love our neighbor,


1353
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:51.499
which includes
family and friends.


1354
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:54.463
It's obvious that you
love family and friends,


1355
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.467
'cause you're here tonight.

1356
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.900
And so I wanna give a toast
to Herbert Permillion III,


1357
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.709
for touching so many
lives, Happy Birthday.


1358
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:03.138
70 years of life.

1359
01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:06.740
- Alright, yay.
(clapping)


1360
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:10.659
(crowd signing Happy Birthday)

1361
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:15.544
(downtempo jazz)

1362
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:20.149
- I love ya, Herb.

1363
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:24.309
(murmuring crowd)
(downtempo jazz)


1364
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:34.580
- See your man over there.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.


1365
01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.985
(chucang)

1366
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.589
- You know, people do
have to go to work.


1367
01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:47.419
You know, I can't sit here
and pet you all afternoon.


1368
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:50.269
So it's rough right now,
yeah, definitely rough.


1369
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:52.620
We'll be all right.

1370
01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.627
I like what I do,

1371
01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:57.105
it's just unfortunate
that it's just not enough


1372
01:05:57.310 --> 01:06:01.588
to where I can make
a decent living off of it.


1373
01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:03.183
I'm a proud man, you know.

1374
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:04.982
I like to work for my own,

1375
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:07.385
and get my own, and
take care of my family.


1376
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.064
I want my family to be proud
of me, that's the main thing.


1377
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:13.626
And I know they are,
you know, my boys are.


1378
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:17.222
You know, I was taught
never to give up.


1379
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:21.304
I'm never gonna give up, I'll
never just throw in the towel.


1380
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:22.625
I'm gonna always keep
trying, you know.


1381
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:24.548
I owe that to my parents.

1382
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:26.502
They were hard working people,
they came to California


1383
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.622
back in the 405 to work in
these shipyards out here.


1384
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:32.788
They sacrificed a lot, they
did a lot to raise nine kids.


1385
01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.659
So I owe it to them not
to slouch off or be a bum.


1386
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.982
They worked hard and I
patterned my life after them.


1387
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:43.387
And I want my sons to pattern
theirs after me somewhat.


1388
01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:45.660
So gotta keep going,
gotta keep goin.


1389
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:47.986
Always gotta keep goin.

1390
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:50.260
(clicking)

1391
01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:00.906
(whirring)
(clicking)


1392
01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:04.659
That thing's gonna probably
hit right in the middle.


1393
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:06.667
- [Martin] I've been
collecting it 25 years now


1394
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:10.465
and I realize that I'll
never shake this obsession.


1395
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:14.661
I've come to San Francisco
to see a collector


1396
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:16.542
who has one of the
greatest collections


1397
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:18.661
of Sholes and Gliddens.

1398
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.821
Jim Rauen has amassed
what is arguably


1399
01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:23.225
the biggest collection
of these machines.


1400
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:25.944
He has 12 of them, wow.

1401
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:28.186
I am the kid in the candy store,

1402
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:31.462
- I've never really
used my typewriters.


1403
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.541
I've just preserved 'em.

1404
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.502
- [Martin] That's good,
that's the important thing.


1405
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:38.508
It's much harder now to find
a Sholes and Glidden typewriter


1406
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:40.189
in the wild.

1407
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:43.547
- [Jim] This is Sholes
and Glidden 2540.


1408
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.388
- [Martin] Oh,
this is exquisite.


1409
01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:47.262
I've only been collecting
for half the time


1410
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:50.223
that Jim has, he started
collecting 50 years ago


1411
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:52.466
and at that time there
were only a handful


1412
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.109
of typewriter collectors.

1413
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:58.548
- 3026, that is
a gorgeous machine.


1414
01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.183
You'll love that one.

1415
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:03.666
And that should do it
except for those two.


1416
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:06.663
Oh, boy, I used to
have your energy.


1417
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.984
- I should take off
my wedding ring.


1418
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:14.739
- [Jim] Is your wife into
typewriters at all, Mark?


1419
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:16.781
- In a word, no.

1420
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:20.380
(grunting)

1421
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:23.468
Oh my, those are shiny
and beautiful, wow.


1422
01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.422
- I think I've got more
Sholes and Gliddens


1423
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:27.780
than the Smithsonian does.

1424
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:29.582
(ding)

1425
01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:32.020
- Wow, look at that, eh.

1426
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:35.342
It's always a rather personal
question to ask a collector


1427
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.747
if they have a particular
machine for sale.


1428
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.423
Are you still looking
for Sholes and Gliddens?


1429
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:42.746
I guess certainly if
you saw one, you'd...


1430
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:46.869
- Well, I don't
know now whether...


1431
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:51.780
So many things economy-wise
have changed for us.


1432
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:55.062
- [Martin] Difficult times.

1433
01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:57.738
But as collectors, we
all sort of have to put


1434
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:02.387
our hat into the ring and
make our desires known.


1435
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:06.544
It's important not
to be too meek.


1436
01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.980
I suspect that over the years
you've had other collectors


1437
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:11.664
who have come to
you interested in


1438
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.782
buying a Sholes and Glidden
typewriter from you,


1439
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:16.059
has that been the case?

1440
01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:18.067
- [Jim] Yes.

1441
01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:21.785
Let me ask you this, what are
your thoughts about selling


1442
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:23.782
some of your typewriters
at this stage.


1443
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:27.579
- Right now, I seriously,
really don't have any plans


1444
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.309
for selling them now.

1445
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:34.020
There's still more
research I'd like to do


1446
01:09:34.230 --> 01:09:35.868
and have the machines for.

1447
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:38.180
- I understand that,
I understand.


1448
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:41.826
- I'd love to see the
collection preserved in a museum


1449
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:44.703
of some type, mechanical museum,

1450
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:48.698
maybe even a typewriter museum.

1451
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:51.743
- [Martin] It's very nice, I
would come visit that museum.


1452
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:53.668
- Oh, love to have you.

1453
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:59.824
- [Martin] I dreamed of
this moment for a long time,


1454
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:02.823
to be sitting and looking at
a Sholes and Glidden typewriter


1455
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:05.140
and knowing it was mine.

1456
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:07.386
(clicking)

1457
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:09.626
My hunt will continue.

1458
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:12.259
(crowd chatter)

1459
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.180
I love connecting to the past.

1460
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:18.506
Still yet, the past
is so elusive.


1461
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:21.548
(light piano music)

1462
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:27.862
My typewriter room has some
trappings from my youth.


1463
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:31.107
It's got a fire engine that I
had when I was six years old


1464
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:34.103
and I've got some windup toys
my mother used to bring back


1465
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:35.829
to us from Germany.

1466
01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.425
(click)

1467
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:42.269
I have a twin brother,
I'll give you my only twin joke.


1468
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.823
Now you know what twins are?

1469
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:45.344
They're womb-mates.

1470
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.102
That's my dad and mother.

1471
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:52.380
I first experienced
collecting from my parents


1472
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:54.501
collecting these
interesting tools.


1473
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.220
My dad would restore them,
cobbler's tools, cooper's tools,


1474
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:59.863
kitchen implements.

1475
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.901
- It's an electric comb.

1476
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:04.066
- [Martin] This is our house,

1477
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:05.669
my parents still have that house

1478
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:08.668
that we moved into in 1966.

1479
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:11.430
There was the Dawn River
in the back garden.


1480
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.905
We'd build boats, we'd get
a door and put walls around it


1481
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:15.907
and we'd go floating
it on the river.


1482
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:18.783
We had annual lamb roasts,
pretty grand barbecues.


1483
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:20.423
It was a real party house.

1484
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:22.746
This is a pulley ride
down the back garden.


1485
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.510
She's 85 years old,
my dad built a zip line


1486
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.941
300 feet long from the top
right down to the pine trees


1487
01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:30.583
at the bottom of the hill.

1488
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:32.388
And this is
a massive teeter totter


1489
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:35.263
my dad built with a universal
joint in the middle.


1490
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:37.267
A sort of carnival ride.

1491
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:41.702
We built balsa wood gliders,

1492
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:45.061
that's an eight foot
wingspan on that one.


1493
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:48.784
I am capturing my past.

1494
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:50.628
It's there with me,
my past, my room,


1495
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.582
my playroom, it's still with me

1496
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:56.419
and I'm very happy to have
them with me in this room now.


1497
01:11:56.630 --> 01:12:00.543
(crowd chatter)
(light piano music)


1498
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.469
I love to chase the past

1499
01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:09.184
and to capture it
the best I can.


1500
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:15.947
The past is a luxurious pursuit

1501
01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:19.307
which I've luckily
been able to indulge,


1502
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:20.625
to some extent.

1503
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:26.303
(seagulls chirping)

1504
01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:33.028
(light ambient indie)

1505
01:12:58.070 --> 01:13:00.026
- I finally sold some work.

1506
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:03.307
A tech CEO from Silicon Valley

1507
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:06.024
had seen the deer and wanted it.

1508
01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:10.027
He contacted me and
asked me to install it


1509
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:14.189
in his apartment in San
Francisco while he was away.


1510
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:18.428
It was really good timing.

1511
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:23.146
Just paying people who
I owe money already.


1512
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:25.022
And then the money's all
gone, but it allows me


1513
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:27.545
to move forward a little bit.

1514
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.185
I was happy someone
appreciated it.


1515
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:35.142
And that was what I
dreamed about when I moved


1516
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:38.023
from the mountains to the
city, was that at some point,


1517
01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:40.460
I'd be installing my work
in a really nice apartment


1518
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:42.382
with a beautiful view

1519
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:46.265
and that my work meant
something to someone.


1520
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.825
(clattering)

1521
01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:52.666
Bruce Sterling,
the science fiction author,


1522
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:55.668
posted something on
Wired.com about my work


1523
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:58.065
and then Cory Doctorow
started posting stuff of mine


1524
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:59.948
on BoingBoing.

1525
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:02.300
After that I got picked
up by Popular Mechanics,


1526
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:05.547
Gizmodo, Engadget,
a lot of the tech blogs.


1527
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:07.229
(clacking)

1528
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:09.148
Things started to
pick up very quickly.


1529
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:11.227
How many of you recognize
this sound, what is it?


1530
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:13.546
I started getting calls from
people in Silicon Valley.


1531
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.103
- How many of you actually
learned how to type


1532
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:16.868
on a typewriter?

1533
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.822
High tech people
creating new technologies


1534
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:22.067
who were interested
in buying my work.


1535
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:26.104
This piece is a portrait
bust of Mark Zuckerberg,


1536
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.301
the head of Facebook.

1537
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.580
Christmas present for
him from a friend.


1538
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:36.705
Hopefully it looks
a little like him.


1539
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:39.140
Mark's eyes are kind
of a little wide set.


1540
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:45.425
The insides of his eyes are
kind of turned up a little bit.


1541
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:52.822
Sometimes I'll get anonymous
hate mails on my website


1542
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:57.507
or comments on
Instagram or Facebook,


1543
01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.905
where someone's
obviously very upset.


1544
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:03.068
And I'm doin' what I do.

1545
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:04.942
They'd rather see
the typewriter live


1546
01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:08.540
than have me make my
crappy artwork or whatever.


1547
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:13.063
They wanna save every typewriter

1548
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:17.149
and that's just not
possible, it's not practical.


1549
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:19.142
And it's not gonna happen.

1550
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:22.143
(soft piano music)

1551
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:29.903
This is the way
that I honor them.


1552
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:32.220
I'd much rather see
them in this state


1553
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:36.787
than sitting on
a shelf collecting dust.


1554
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.226
Technology will change us,

1555
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:47.025
we won't be human
in the same way.


1556
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:49.425
We will be a different
kind of human.


1557
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:53.419
This piece is called Thea.

1558
01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:57.185
She's the Greek goddess
of sight and light.


1559
01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:00.069
It's for Oculus VR,
a company that makes


1560
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:03.182
a virtual reality headset,
called the Oculus Rift.


1561
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:05.102
That's technology that
I've been waiting for


1562
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:07.227
since I was a little kid.

1563
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:11.983
Along with a flying car
and all that other stuff.


1564
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:17.786
This is gonna be hanging
from cables in their office.


1565
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:23.062
In the near future,
there's going to be


1566
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:25.181
a huge split in society.

1567
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:27.221
There'll be one group
who'll have all the money


1568
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:30.308
and power to change their
DNA, augment their bodies


1569
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:35.265
with technology and become
machines that can live forever.


1570
01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:38.981
And then there will
be the other group


1571
01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:43.069
who will reject all that for
a completely analog life.


1572
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:46.262
Living in nature with
little or no technology


1573
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.301
and trying to stay human.

1574
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:50.819
(train horn)

1575
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:57.103
(engine running)

1576
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:03.584
- [Ken] When I was a kid, I
liked everything in the future,


1577
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:07.226
I watched the Jetsons,
I liked Johnny Quest,


1578
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:09.466
you know, 'cause he had
technology, I loved it.


1579
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:11.268
I wanted to be Hadji.

1580
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:15.022
But I'm an adult
now and now I see


1581
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.346
what it's really doin' to us.

1582
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:18.659
You know, we had
plants full of workers,


1583
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:20.781
now they're full of robots.

1584
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:24.109
Sometimes we forget
about what happens


1585
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:25.703
when we do have
these innovations,


1586
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:29.061
and the fallout
effect from that.


1587
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:34.668
- Are you at a loss as
a culture if something dies


1588
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:38.300
and nobody appreciates
the death of it?


1589
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:39.989
(soft piano music)

1590
01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:41.305
Maybe, maybe not.

1591
01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:45.706
- Just like time traveling,

1592
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:48.259
when you're comin' in
here looking at one
of these machines.


1593
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:52.304
They take you back
in a place and time.


1594
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:54.307
You can visualize what
was happening in the '405


1595
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:57.468
or World War I or
the '605, if you will,


1596
01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:59.666
just by the typewriters
that we work on here


1597
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:01.861
and the era that
they came out in.


1598
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:04.743
(jazz festive music)

1599
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:08.949
So I'm prayin' to God that
we can keep this thing going.


1600
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:14.307
Fingers crossed.

1601
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:16.341
Fingers crossed, I hope
there's a lot of enthusiasts


1602
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:20.065
still out there, you know,
that want their machines fixed.


1603
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:22.579
Yeah, I can do it,
I mean' I'm not braggin',


1604
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:24.985
but I'm damn good.

1605
01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:27.465
I am, I am, no brag, just fact.

1606
01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:32.340
- Individually,
I think we are a culture,


1607
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:36.543
individually, every
individual is a culture.


1608
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:38.382
But the big picture
of the culture


1609
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:40.780
doesn't make any sense to me.

1610
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:43.550
(festive jazz music)

1611
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:44.660
- [Ken] Yeah.

1612
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:50.385
Here around Christmastime,
we probably do our best work.


1613
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:55.389
When they come in the shop,
it's very nostalgic to 'em.


1614
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:58.388
The typewriter involves
a sense of times gone,


1615
01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:01.502
that I think were
a lot less stressful.


1616
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:10.506
Alright, stick you
on back in here,


1617
01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:12.587
get you all dolled up.

1618
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:14.422
They're time machines.

1619
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:21.303
I think there's enough
people out there


1620
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:23.302
that can keep us afloat.

1621
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:28.868
But I don't know, I don't know.

1622
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:30.662
- I'm not...

1623
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:32.064
- You're not gettin' it yet?
- Look, are you?


1624
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:34.904
Looks kinda somehow uneven.

1625
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:36.509
That looks okay, that one maybe
should go on the other side.


1626
01:19:36.670 --> 01:19:37.819
- That's what
I'm thinkin', yeah,


1627
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:39.145
that can go over there, yeah.

1628
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:41.147
- Yeah, put that over there.

1629
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:42.419
- [Richard] Typewriters are
a so called thing of the past


1630
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:44.461
so people sometimes turn to them

1631
01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:47.821
in an attempt to
recapture the past.


1632
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:49.788
- [Ken] How we
lookin', how we lookin'?


1633
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:51.423
- I think it looks good,
I think it looks way better.


1634
01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:52.779
- It's a way to
travel back in time


1635
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:55.788
to a previous period in history.

1636
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:59.141
I've come to see typewriters
less as objects of nostalgia


1637
01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:00.908
than signs of a future,

1638
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:04.785
signs of something
that's going to happen.


1639
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:07.458
There's a slow movement afoot.

1640
01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:09.900
People realizing that
not everything has to be


1641
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.465
completely efficient,
not everything has to be


1642
01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:16.060
goal oriented, but you can
enjoy the process itself.


1643
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:18.107
You could compare typing to
the slow cooking movement,


1644
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:20.659
the point is not to eat as
efficiently as possible,


1645
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:22.462
the point is to take your time.

1646
01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:25.025
And efficiency is not
the paramount value,


1647
01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:27.300
the point is to enjoy
what you're doing.


1648
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:29.228
- Afraid that you can
talk to your own friends,


1649
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:30.624
but how do we take that
video calling experience


1650
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:32.468
and really make it social?

1651
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:34.308
In fact, you can only
video call with people


1652
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:36.262
who've already accepted
your friend request.


1653
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:38.108
- [Richard] Computers,
they're great tools,


1654
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:40.141
but they're also seductive
and they take away


1655
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.749
some of our power sometimes.

1656
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:42.985
- It's gonna be
a one-click toggle


1657
01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.703
to change between these modes.

1658
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:46.662
- [Richard] There's
a fine line between


1659
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:50.226
having something help you and
having you be dependent on it.


1660
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:51.903
- [Woman] We have
facial detection,


1661
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:53.862
which actually tells
you if someone's home.


1662
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:55.503
- [Woman] You have face alerts,

1663
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:56.859
if someone walks
into the living room,


1664
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:58.788
you can receive a face alert.

1665
01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:00.981
- I don't wanna find out
tomorrow what happened today.


1666
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.868
I wanna find out within
seconds or microseconds,


1667
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:04.748
if possible.

1668
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:05.746
Social media allows
everyone to know everything


1669
01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:07.542
about everyone.

1670
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:09.308
- We added a little
accelerometer inside the sensor,


1671
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:10.943
you're actually
gonna get a vibration


1672
01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:12.503
to let you know to
stand up straight.


1673
01:21:12.710 --> 01:21:14.462
And it takes all
your data points,


1674
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:15.739
and then the real secret
sauce is where our engineers


1675
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:17.628
had made all the algorithms

1676
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:19.508
that take all this data
and actually turn it into


1677
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.468
insights and information.

1678
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.143
- There'll be always those
people who are against it,


1679
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:24.783
but I think for the most part,

1680
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:26.548
people'll start to
come around to it.


1681
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:29.947
- I was having this
rebellious moment,


1682
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:32.340
this feeling of being
sick of the digital world,


1683
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:37.539
how intrusive it is, how pesky
it is, how invasive it is.


1684
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.538
And I went to my typewriter
and wrote down a manifesto.


1685
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:45.538
(clicking)
(motivational music)


1686
01:21:57.190 --> 01:22:00.546
"We assert our right
to resist the Paradigm.


1687
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:05.621
"To rebel against the

1698
01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:59.621
(whirring)

1699
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:07.266
After I wrote it, I put
it through the scanner


1700
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:09.665
and shared it online.

1701
01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:13.382
Then I put a little
note on my blog saying,


1702
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:15.467
Psst, visit this website
where you can find it


1703
01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:17.342
and people did.

1704
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:20.269
They started copying it,
retyping it, sharing it.


1705
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:23.143
Here's somebody who
translated it into Italian,


1706
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:26.581
here's a translation
into Serbian.


1707
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:29.060
Then in a few weeks, I started
getting postcards, letters


1708
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:32.626
in my mailbox from the
insurgency around the world.


1709
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:34.980
The revolution reached
the village of Graubunden,


1710
01:23:35.190 --> 01:23:38.660
located in the Southern
Valley, agent Neckerman Jr.


1711
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:40.508
"Greetings from
the insurrection,


1712
01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:42.462
"we are pleased to inform
you that typewriters


1713

1714

"Unfortunately it was
not a bloodless coup.

"Sometimes the unenlightened

contact with a new cell

1728

"The revolution will

1746
01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:02.623
(soft piano music)

1747
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:12.025
- Sometimes I feel
homesick for a place


1748
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:14.306
I can never really get back to.

1749
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:20.741
My father died last June,

1750
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:23.379
he was 86.

1751
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:28.384
Eventually, the house
will have to be sold.


1752
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:37.987
The house was the house
that people came to to play,


1753
01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:39.339
it was where my friends came,

1754
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:41.945
it was the adventure playground.

1755
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:48.939
I can see myself in

1756
01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:50.822
walking along the river

1757
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:54.864
and approaching my parents'
house from the valley.


1758
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:58.182
I come down here and imagine
the pleasures of childhood


1759
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:59.789
that were had here.

1760
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:05.783
- [Herb] Want something
to drink, here?


1761
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:07.748
- Yeah, lemonade, medium.
- Oh okay.


1762
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:09.309
What's up?
- Right here good?


1763
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:11.865
- [Herb] Yeah, that's fine.

1764
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:13.907
(humming)

1765
01:26:14.110 --> 01:26:17.500
- [Ken] Herb decided not to
take the offer on the building.


1766
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:20.503
He decided, well let's just
not give up hope yet on it,


1767
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:22.541
let's see if we can
keep this thing going.


1768
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:28.462
We realized we needed a website.

1769
01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:31.264
- The whole typewriter thing
seems to be a fad right now,


1770
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:33.938
but I think it's more than that.

1771
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:37.262
All these kids out there
wanting typewriters,


1772
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:39.825
the only way they're
gonna see that is online.


1773
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:43.824
(clacking)
(beep)


1774
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:46.345
It seems funny that the only
way that California Typewriter


1775
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:50.828
will be able to survive is
by embracing new technology.


1776
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:53.703
Using social
networking in a website


1777
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:55.901
just to tell people
that they exist.


1778
01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:57.862
Here it is, update.
- Okay.


1779
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:00.425
- It's gonna say
update on your main,


1780
01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:02.228
it's way easier on the app.

1781
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:04.864
They can manage their
promotion through the web.


1782
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:06.867
I just took a great picture of

1783
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:10.622
an Instagram post
that says something.


1784
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:12.149
Yeah, they won't have
to wait for anybody


1785
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:14.381
to come into their
store anymore.


1786
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:17.662
Here I'm gonna say this
super clean, little beauty.


1787
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:20.225
They can arrange repairs
and ship typewriters.


1788
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:21.624
$440?

1789
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:23.707
- [Carmen] Yeah, $440.

1790
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:26.470
- [Jeremy] And they can stay
in that space, happy there,


1791
01:27:26.670 --> 01:27:29.707
the whole family keeps
working together and


1792
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:31.508
it'd be great.

1793
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:33.348
- Right now the site
just pretty much features


1794
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:35.506
profiles of the store and
of the employees in it


1795
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.786
and what we do and how
long we've been here.


1796
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:39.503
And it features a few machines,

1797
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:41.741
but it certainly has to
grow bigger than that.


1798
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:44.020
One thing about
the new technology


1799
01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:45.902
is that even though
we may hate it,


1800
01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:46.906
we need it.

1801
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.906
(laughing)

1802
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:50.988
(crowd noise)

1803
01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:52.828
First of all, we wanna
thank you guys for comin'.


1804
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:54.941
This is our first type in.

1805
01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:57.061
this place hasn't been bumping
like this in a while, so.


1806
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:59.904
Welcome and thank
you for coming.


1807
01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.742
Yeah, basic service
runs about $75


1808
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:03.429
and the ribbon's about $15.

1809
01:28:03.630 --> 01:28:04.460
Give you a name
and a phone number


1810
01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:06.228
to call back at.

1811
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:07.863
Okay, great.

1812
01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:10.578
(clicking)

1813
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:13.702
(crowd chatter)

1814
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:14.985
- We're all a little weird.

1815
01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:16.703
When you have an addiction

1816
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:18.502
and you find other
like-minded people,


1817
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:20.308
this whole group of people
enabling each other.


1818
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:22.301
- I thought it was a
good opportunity to come


1819
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:23.943
and meet lots of other people
who bother with typewriters.


1820
01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:26.618
- I'm worse than an alcoholic.

1821
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:28.309
Somebody come up
with a creative way


1822
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:30.381
for Typewriters
Anonymous and I'm that.


1823
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:32.541
- My name's Tony Midley and
I have a typewriter problem.


1824
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:34.308
- I have a typewriter
problem, too, and I love it.


1825
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:36.068
- I think there's
actually a lot of people


1826
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:37.379
who fit the description
of high tech people


1827
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:39.023
who have kind of had enough

1828
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:41.022
and have gone back
to the analog world.


1829
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:42.669
I actually work for Facebook,
which is really interesting


1830
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:43.939
to me, because I spend
all of my time online,


1831
01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:45.862
social networking.

1832
01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:47.225
I think a lot of people
wanna get away from that,


1833
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:49.102
or withdraw from that.

1834
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:50.584
Even young people, and
I think that's why they're


1835
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:52.985
attracted to
technology like this.


1836
01:28:53.190 --> 01:28:56.227
- There's never going to
be a typewriter movement.


1837
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:58.864
It's just about,
instead of there being


1838
01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:01.948
this one massive
way of thinking,


1839
01:29:02.150 --> 01:29:04.300
there are many, many smaller,

1840
01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:08.139
more niche sort
of ways of being.


1841
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:09.829
Which would be
great to have again.


1842
01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:11.429
- I'm Sylvia.
- Hi, I'm Mike.


1843
01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:13.586
- And bringing back this village

1844
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:15.985
by way of different
neighborhoods.


1845
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:17.987
These guys, they're
on the typewriter


1846
01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:20.027
and they're naturalists.

1847
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:22.545
You're gonna see a group of
people grow, and grow, and grow


1848
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:24.229
and grow and grow.

1849
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:25.988
- Hope we can do it
again every year.


1850
01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:28.425
That's it, alright.

1851
01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:30.746
(tinkling)

1852
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:37.579
(cha-cha music)

1853
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:43.260
(dinging)

1854
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:48.066
- [Actor] How do you do,
are you an actress? (chuckling)


1855
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:50.738
- [Actress] You have
a fantastic set.


1856
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:52.986
- We call her the fate machine.

1857
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:54.020
- [Actress] What?

1858
01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:55.026
- You see,

1859
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:59.779
typewriter keys represent
the keys of life.


1860
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:01.309
(chiming)

1861
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:03.819
And we human beings
dance on them


1862
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:07.659
and then when you dance,
as we press down the keys


1863
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:11.067
of the machine, the
story that's written


1864
01:30:12.710 --> 01:30:14.382
is the story of our fate.

1865
01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:16.740
- [Actress] It's very symbolic.

1866
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.706
- Thank you.

1867
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:21.060
(chiming)

1868
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:24.744
(engine rattling)

1869
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:32.548
- [Jeremy] Typewriter
really isn't dead,


1870
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:37.062
it's still getting used
in India, at least.


1871
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:40.467
(upbeat Bollywood music)

1872
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:51.263
There are these info
slums, places where people


1873
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:53.665
type for a living on the street.

1874
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:56.430
Not for creative purposes,
not for writing poems


1875
01:30:56.630 --> 01:30:57.540
or for writing novels, but

1876
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:59.308
for business purposes.

1877
01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:01.068
(engine revving)

1878
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:02.908
It was recently announced

1879
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:04.338
that the last typewriter
manufacturing plant


1880
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:06.029
was closing down.

1881
01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:08.300
- The last typewriter
manufacturer on earth


1882
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:09.909
has shut down.

1883
01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:12.305
The factory was
in Mumbai, India.


1884
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:14.108
The company was 60 years old,

1885
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:15.982
it opened in the time of Nehru.

1886
01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:17.748
- [Jeremy] Godrej and
Boyce stopped their


1887
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:20.862
typewriter manufacturing
about three years ago.


1888
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:22.947
- [TV Announcer] They sold 105
of thousands of typewriters


1889
01:31:23.150 --> 01:31:25.186
every year, until the
typewriter was just killed off


1890
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:27.187
by the computer.

1891
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:29.545
- [Jeremy] Godrej brought
me here to create sculptures


1892
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.547
from the last 100 typewriters

1893
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:34.184
that rolled off
their assembly line.


1894
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:36.142
I don't know what
I'm gonna make yet.


1895
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:40.263
(clinking)
(murmuring)


1896
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:46.540
Godrej wanted the
sculpture to be a symbol of


1897
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:48.508
their commitment to innovation.

1898
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:51.867
To represent their move
into the 215t century.


1899
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:56.063
(honking)
(distant chanting)


1900
01:31:58.790 --> 01:32:02.749
(light ambient music)
(clinking)


1901
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:09.547
The lotus, it rises
from the filth.


1902
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:12.662
From the murky water at
he bottom of the pond


1903
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:15.100
and blossoms into this pure,

1904
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:19.304
uncontaminated, delicate flower.

1905
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:25.025
The symbol of enlightenment,
rebirth, perfection.


1906
01:32:25.230 --> 01:32:29.189
Something beautiful growing
from the bottom of a dirty pond.


1907
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:37.062
There's no such
thing as permanence.


1908
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:40.945
Things die and they're
reborn as something new.


1909
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:44.779
I don't wanna look back.

1910
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:47.823
The future is the only thing
you can do anything about.


1911
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:50.908
You can't do anything
about the past.


1912
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:55.303
A lot of people
are really scared


1913
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:57.148
about how the
future is unfolding


1914
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:58.829
and the only way
to think about it


1915
01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:01.220
is to be optimistic.

1916
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:02.943
We're gonna do amazing
things with technology,


1917
01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:03.980
we have to.

1918
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:08.181
The thing that people
who are afraid of change


1919
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:10.267
should remember is that
people born after you are,


1920
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:12.222
living in your time, they
don't want what you want.


1921
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:14.705
They want what's in their time.

1922
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:25.183
(engine running)
(light ambient music)


1923
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:27.386
We can't stop that
habit that people have


1924
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:30.263
of taking knowledge and
trying to tweak the world


1925
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:34.258
around us with it, we're
always going to do that.


1926
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:43.218
I don't know what the
future holds for me.


1927
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:47.389
I'm doing what I love and
I'm doing what I want.


1928
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:50.343
I don't know where I'm gonna
be six months from now.


1929
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:52.700
(clicking)

1930
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:58.349
- [Martin] I remember
when I told my wife


1931
01:33:58.590 --> 01:34:00.820
that I'd had my first
typewriter dream.


1932
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:03.828
She was quite alarmed.

1933
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:07.102
I'm looking in a big
glass window of a store,


1934
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.306
it's nighttime, they're closed.

1935
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:12.388
And I look in and I see shelves.

1936
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:15.383
And on the shelves are
wonderful, early typewriters.


1937
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:19.299
Rare ones, unusual ones,
ones I've never seen before.


1938
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:21.262
And my eyes dance
along the shelves,


1939
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:23.461
checking out these treasures.

1940
01:34:23.670 --> 01:34:25.900
But I can't get in,
the door's locked.


1941
01:34:26.110 --> 01:34:27.862
Sometimes I'm
actually transported


1942
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:30.026
into the store, and I get to get

1943
01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:32.221
really close to the shelves.

1944
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:33.863
I never touched the typewriters,

1945
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:36.538
I can never touch
them, but I get close.


1946
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:38.701
That's as far as it goes.

1947
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:44.824
- I have no idea what the
life of this typewriter was


1948
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:48.466
before I had the privilege
of possessing it.


1949
01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:51.628
Nor do I have any idea
what will become of it


1950
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:54.503
when my turn is over.

1951
01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:56.905
I'd like to think it
will stay in our family


1952
01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:00.506
and maybe there will be
grandchildren that wanna write.


1953
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:03.065
And maybe one or two of them
might be peculiar enough


1954
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:06.501
to enjoy this as much as
their grandfather did.


1955
01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:08.666
- Hello, hi, my gosh.

1956
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:09.899
Alan, I'm Martin, hi.

1957
01:35:10.110 --> 01:35:11.179
We've met before, I think.

1958
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:12.664
- We've talked on the phone.

1959
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:14.263
- We have.
- But we haven't met.


1960
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:15.983
- Well we've got
catching up to do.


1961
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:16.986
There's typewriters
in these hills, eh?


1962
01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:18.225
Hi.

1963
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:19.465
- Canadian boy.
- Oh.


1964
01:35:19.710 --> 01:35:20.779
This year, there's a gathering

1965
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:22.781
of antique typewriter collectors

1966
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:24.901
in Morgantown, West Virginia
at Herman Price's house.


1967
01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:27.146
- [Man] Have you seen his
Manhattan paper table.


1968
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:28.300
- No.
- It's like the Mona Lisa.


1969
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:30.188
- Oh, come, come.

1970
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:33.308
Herman Price, his whole
basement is a labyrinth


1971
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:36.866
of rooms and corridors where
typewriters are stacked


1972
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:39.538
on shelves from the floor
right up to the ceiling.


1973
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:41.547
- Anybody come from 2,000 miles?

1974
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:42.580
(murmuring assent)

1975
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:44.508
3,000 miles.

1976
01:35:44.710 --> 01:35:46.223
(laughing)

1977
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:48.500
4,000 miles.

1978
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:51.349
And the winner is, Marty Rice.

1979
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:52.949
Come on up here, Marty.

1980
01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:55.106
I have a lot of typewriters.

1981
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:57.187
It's approximately 700.

1982
01:35:57.390 --> 01:36:00.268
Marty is from outer space.
(laughter)


1983
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:02.665
And I've found that collecting
the typewriter friends


1984
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:05.338
is a lot more fun than
collecting typewriters.


1985
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:08.787
- This is a white
Moll number three.


1986
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:10.548
- [Martin] There's
a whole range of ages here


1987
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:14.902
from 14, the youngest,
up to 75 approaching 80.


1988
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:17.101
- And it's just a fun machine

1989
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:18.908
that makes you
smile to look at it.


1990
01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:21.459
- Mostly men, all men.

1991
01:36:21.670 --> 01:36:23.422
A bit strange, I don't
know why that is.


1992
01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:24.949
- I take it back
with me, the hopper,


1993
01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:27.067
and I sleep with her tonight.

1994
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:29.226
And then I'll take
it back tomorrow.


1995
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:32.627
- Alright, so this is
my Oliver Woodstock,


1996
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.223
absolutely no relation to...

1997
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:35.943
- [Martin] It's
just wonderful to


1998
01:36:36.150 --> 01:36:37.902
share our passion of
early typewriters.


1999
01:36:38.110 --> 01:36:39.748
- Did you have to do much
to it or was it like that


2000
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:41.747
when you got it?

2001
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:45.420
I'll never be able to get
all the antique typewriters.


2002
01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:47.149
It's spectacular.

2003
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:48.339
There's always gonna
be people out there


2004
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:50.899
with bigger collections.

2005
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:53.226
- If I had to keep
only one typewriter,


2006
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:57.463
if I had to get rid of them
all and only have one left,


2007
01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:08.026
There is a version of this
Smith Corona, which is the


2008
01:37:08.230 --> 01:37:10.425
silent Smith Corona.

2009
01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:16.425
I have an electric
version of this,


2010
01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:18.825
which is kind of like
a hybrid model of it,


2011
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:22.306
'cause the only thing in it
that is electric is the keys.


2012
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:23.386
But there is...

2013
01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:25.268
Let me move this.

2014
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:28.223
Smith Corona, Skywriter,
definitely on the top five list.


2015
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:30.500
If you can only take five
typewriters with you,


2016
01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:32.428
that would be it.

2017
01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:37.658
Hermes 2000, definitely might
wanna take that bad boy.


2018
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:39.622
The Olympia's okay,
but quite frankly,


2019
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:42.822
the rise of the keys
is a little too high.


2020
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:46.386
Somewhere around whenever
they started making this,


2021
01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:48.228
the Smith Corona Silent
and various other models


2022
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:51.979
that have the same silhouette,
the rise on the keys


2023
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:53.703
is just almost perfect.

2024
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:56.464
Going from an N to a Y
requires almost nothing.


2025
01:37:56.670 --> 01:38:00.140
The size of the type is not
too big and not too small.


2026
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:03.501
But listen to the
solidity of the action.


2027
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.388
(clacking)

2028
01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:08.747
This is a solid,
solid piece of machine


2029
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:11.259
that's got beautiful
highlights like the stripes


2030
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:14.866
here and there, the colors are
good, I love the green keys.


2031
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:17.789
I would probably say that
this with a good case


2032
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:20.743
would be the one
typewriter I would take


2033
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:22.906
and that's why it's
kinda out right now.


2034
01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:25.066
I rotate this one
into use an awful lot.


2035
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:27.062
(clack clack)

2036
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:28.100
I confess.

2037
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:30.028
(clack clack)

2038
01:38:30.230 --> 01:38:32.539
- I'm not picking the typewriter
because I think it's hip.


2039
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:36.538
It's the best version of the
idea that's ever come around.


2040
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.308
And for me, I think
the best way to live


2041
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:42.867
is to incorporate the
best of the last 100 years


2042
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:45.265
into a hybrid that works.

2043
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:49.145
Write a book on a typewriter
and promote it on Twitter.


2044
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:51.227
Why not use the spectrum.

2045
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:55.580
You just have to make sure
you get yourself a typewriter


2046
01:38:55.790 --> 01:39:00.306
on Ebay or some blade runner-y
kind of back alley deal


2047
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:05.345
and say, well, I'm happy
to be typing on it.


2048
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:07.268
- [Ken] I think they're here,
I think they're coming back


2049
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:10.382
and I think they're gonna
be around for a while.


2050
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:12.023
We have a pretty good
supply right now.


2051
01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:13.743
Herb's always out
lookin' for 'em.


2052
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:17.300
He's at flea markets,
he's at garage sales.


2053
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:19.501
There's still a lot
of 'em out there.


2054
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:21.905
We've got a good supply,
but I kinda believe


2055
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:24.988
that you can never
have too many.


2056
01:39:25.190 --> 01:39:28.262
You know, you can
never have too many.


2057
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:29.869
- [TV Host] You know
what, I, like you,


2058
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:32.584
mourn the loss of
the typewriter.


2059
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:35.668
And then you come
up with an app.


2060
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:37.462
- [Tom] I came up with an app.

2061
01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:39.865
The Hanx Writer, 
Hanx with an x.

2062
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:41.503
And I've gotta tell you, man,

2063
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:44.619
of dollars off of this.

2064
01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:46.263
(chucang)

2065
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:48.665
I have figured out
how to make a computer


2066
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:51.384
work like a typewriter.
(laughing)


2067
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:53.421
- [Ken] We're havin'
people come in the shop


2068
01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:56.098
and say, I just did a Google
search for typewriter repair


2069
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:58.141
and you popped up.

2070
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:59.499
- In World War II,
that used to be


2071
01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:01.302
the reporter style typewriter.

2072
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:03.978
They used to send in reports
from the battlefield.


2073
01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:06.101
So this has been to
World War II and back.


2074
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:08.301
So that's a lot of
sentimental value, I guess.


2075
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:10.023
- [Ken] They're comin'
from all over the place.


2076
01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:12.903
From far away as LA,
ones from San Diego.


2077
01:40:13.110 --> 01:40:15.578
It really shows what
the website did.


2078
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:17.621
- Oh, excuse me.
(chucang)


2079
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:20.788
- I'm certainly no prophet,
I can't see into the future,


2080
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:23.504
but we're hanging in there.

2081
01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:25.666
California Typewriter is here

2082
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:28.464
and we still repair typewriters.

2083
01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:31.264
(soft jazz music)

2084
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.660
(wind noise)

2085
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:42.310
- It was too directly
bound to its own anguish


2086
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:45.229
to be anything other
than a cry of negation,


2087
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:48.900
carrying within itself the
seeds of its own destruction.


2088
01:40:49.110 --> 01:40:52.989
That's the last two lines of
the Encyclopedia Britannica


2089
01:40:53.190 --> 01:40:56.262
description of the
dada movement of art.


2090
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:59.343
You could use that to explain
anything in the world.


2091
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:02.662
It's the ultimate
all-purpose answer.


2092
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:06.067
If it takes a hen and
a half, a day and a half,


2093
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:09.785
to lay an egg and a half,
how long does it take


2094
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:12.902
a one legged grasshopper
to kick the seeds


2095
01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:14.549
out of a dill pickle?

2096
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:16.149
What are you gonna say?

2097
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:17.902
Two seconds,
two minutes, two days?


2098
01:41:18.150 --> 01:41:21.108
It's completely boring
compared to that question.


2099
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:23.022
(jingly whirring)

2100
01:41:23.230 --> 01:41:26.028
When you explain things,
you rob them of their mystery.


2101
01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:29.745
Questions are far more
interesting than answers.


2102
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:32.464
There's no meaning
to the universe,


2103
01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:36.749
but you might say our job
is to give it meaning.


2104
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:39.180
But that's for our amusement.

2105
01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:41.745
The universe could care less.

2106
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:45.022
(light accordion music)

2107
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:50.781
(clacking)

2108
01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:59.743
(smooth jazz music)

2109
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:22.504
- I like the feeling of
making something with my hands


2110
01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:24.940
I like working with my
hands, I like to paint,


2111
01:42:25.150 --> 01:42:26.788
I like to build things.

2112
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:31.506
And with this machine,
I'm working with my hands.


2113
01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:33.507
- I just feel this
incredible tension


2114
01:42:33.710 --> 01:42:36.861
as I get older between what
I would like to see happen


2115
01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:40.580
and what's just
gonna happen anyway.


2116
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:44.226
- You know, I'm not gonna
bemoan the passing of an era.


2117
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:46.102
There's a certain point

2118
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:49.108
where everything left me
in the dust. (chuckles)


2119
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:51.824
And I was happy to
be left in the dust.


2120
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:54.021
- But all this,
it's all going away.


2121
01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:57.825
The only people that will
keep this up is insane people


2122
01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:00.385
and dilettantes and artists.

2123
01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:03.940
Mad geniuses like myself and
a handful of other people.


2124
01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:06.584
(jazz music)
