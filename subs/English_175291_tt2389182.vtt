-Oh--

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:48.375
we missed our window.

00:01:07.427 --> 00:01:08.929
-Um, yeah, actually.

11
00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.899
Right behind his left ear.

12
00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:13.483
Don't kill him, all right?

13
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.484
-Oh, no.

14
00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:15.485
No, no.

15
00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:17.437
We're gonna make a sleeper
       out of him.

OK.

All right.

Yeah.

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:36.506
Ahh!

Ow, ow--

26
00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.012
give Daddy his glasses back.

-You look sharp.

00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:54.357
-Mm, I didn't have
  time to iron.

-Well, I can't tell.

34
00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:57.861
No coffee for you.

35
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:59.863
No coffee for you.

36
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.064
Oh, you know what?

37
00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:02.616
You're gonna need gas.

38
00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:04.118
-Oh, OK.

39
00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:04.618
Got money?

Yeah.

42
00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.620
Can you take him?

-Yeah.

44
00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:08.237

Hey.

00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:26.139
Are you going to have
 time to talk to Doug


56
00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.057

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:19.536
How you doing, buddy?

Yeah, yeah.

Good.

00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:21.538
How's everything?

73
00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:24.257
Audrey good?

CRAIG (ON PHONE): Hey, babe.

77
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:06.132
I just wanted to let you know
I'm going to be a little late.


78
00:05:06.132 --> 00:05:09.168
I'm gonna go grab a drink
 with Enrique after work.


79
00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.672
So I'll see you tonight.

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:44.788
-Give me your money.

00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:46.289
-Oh, shit.

Oh my god, man.

90
00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:54.798
You scared the shit out of me.

91
00:05:54.798 --> 00:05:56.300
-Well, you gotta watch
 your back, brother.


92
00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:58.301
How many times have
  I told you that?


93
00:05:58.301 --> 00:06:00.303
-Yeah, yeah.

94
00:06:00.303 --> 00:06:01.304
-Look at you, man.

95
00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:02.806
I haven't seen you
   in a minute.


96
00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:05.275
Hey, whatever you're drinking
       I'm buying, OK?


97
00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:06.309
-Thanks.

98
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:07.811
No, actually I gotta
  get out of here.


99
00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:08.312
I gotta get home.

100
00:06:08.311 --> 00:06:09.279
-Are you kidding me?

101
00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.814
I haven't seen you
  in five years.


102
00:06:10.814 --> 00:06:12.816
I'm not letting you leave
     without a drink.


103
00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:13.817
-Really, five years?

104
00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:14.568
-Five years, man.

105
00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:17.453
One drink.

106
00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:18.454
-Yeah, OK.

107
00:06:18.454 --> 00:06:18.955
Yeah, I'll have another one.

108
00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:20.457
-Yeah, my man.

109
00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:21.457
Um, whatever he's having,
     and, uh, Jameson


110
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:22.909
on the rocks, please.

111
00:06:25.962 --> 00:06:26.463
Wow.

112
00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:28.465
What the fuck are you
   doing here, man?


113
00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:30.466
I mean, you're obviously looking
      for trouble, right?


114
00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:32.969
[chuckling]

115
00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:33.970
-Oh my god.

116
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.472
-Oh, yeah.

117
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:37.473
-You're married?

118
00:06:37.473 --> 00:06:38.474
No way.

119
00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:39.425
-Yeah.

120
00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:40.476
-You got kids too?

121
00:06:40.476 --> 00:06:42.478
-Yeah, I have a 15-month-old
            son.


122
00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:43.480
-Wow.

123
00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:43.929
-Want to see his picture?

124
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.482
-Yeah.

125
00:06:45.481 --> 00:06:45.982
Yeah, show me the
  little bugger.


126
00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:48.484
-His name's Keenan.

127
00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:48.985
-Wow.

128
00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:50.937
Keenan, huh?

129
00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:52.489
I mean, he looks just like you.

130
00:06:52.488 --> 00:06:54.440
-Yeah.

131
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.491
Same hairline.

132
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.527
[laughter]

133
00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:00.030
-And that's-- that's--
  that's your wife?


134
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.530
-That's Audrey, yeah.

135
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.031
-She's beautiful, man.

136
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:03.032
-Thanks.

137
00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:04.033
-Congratulations.

138
00:07:04.033 --> 00:07:05.034
Busy five years, huh?

139
00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:06.035
-Yep.

140
00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:07.537
-So let me guess.

141
00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:08.872
You got a house up in Silver
 Lake, a couple of bulldogs


142
00:07:08.872 --> 00:07:09.956
running around.

143
00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:10.924
-Yeah.

144
00:07:10.924 --> 00:07:11.958
-A little office where you
   do all your writing.


145
00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:12.926
You still writing?

146
00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:14.428
-Yeah.

147
00:07:14.427 --> 00:07:16.429
-Wow.

148
00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:21.384
-So, um, you got any pictures
       in your wallet?


149
00:07:21.384 --> 00:07:21.935
-No, no.

150
00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:22.936
Not me.

151
00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:24.387
No.

152
00:07:24.387 --> 00:07:25.438
I got a couple pictures in my
phone, but you probably don't


153
00:07:25.438 --> 00:07:27.857
want to see those.

154
00:07:27.857 --> 00:07:28.858
Do you want to see those?

155
00:07:28.858 --> 00:07:29.859
-No.

156
00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:31.861
[laughter]

157
00:07:34.697 --> 00:07:37.650
-Oh, fuck.

158
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.734
I--

159
00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:41.237
I've been creeping on this thing
     over here for a little


160
00:07:41.237 --> 00:07:41.904
while, man.

161
00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:44.491
That's-- that's a dime, right?

162
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.492
What do you think it takes
    to lock something


163
00:07:46.492 --> 00:07:48.461
like that up, huh?

164
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:50.246
House in the hills and
a Mercedes, probably.


165
00:07:50.246 --> 00:07:51.547
-I wouldn't know.

166
00:07:51.547 --> 00:07:52.548
-No, you wouldn't.

167
00:07:52.548 --> 00:07:55.051
You're off the market
    for good now.


168
00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:57.003
One piece of ass for the
   rest of your life?


169
00:07:57.003 --> 00:07:58.555
You kidding me?

170
00:07:58.554 --> 00:08:00.056
-Yeah, when you're in it, you
don't even really think about


171
00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:00.557
it.

172
00:08:01.057 --> 00:08:02.058
-Not me.

173
00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:04.010
As soon as I get in it,
  I'm already thinking


174
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.562
about the next one.

175
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:08.514
[chuckling]

176
00:08:08.514 --> 00:08:09.565
-Oh--

177
00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:18.358
-So I see, uh, work's
  keeping you busy?


178
00:08:18.358 --> 00:08:19.860
-Oh--

179
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:20.861
yeah.

180
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.361
Yeah.

181
00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:24.865
-You paying the bills OK?

182
00:08:24.864 --> 00:08:26.366
-Yeah, I mean, I get by.

183
00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:27.868
You know.

184
00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:28.284
I'm--

185
00:08:28.284 --> 00:08:29.869
I'm not rich, but--

186
00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:34.875
-Let me ask you something.

187
00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:35.875
When you--

188
00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:39.379
when you go to collect
 money, right, like--


189
00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:40.380
how-- how's it go down?

190
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.349
Like, how does that work?

191
00:08:42.348 --> 00:08:44.383
-What-- what do you mean?

192
00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:46.887
-Well, like, does it always
    have to get violent?


193
00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:50.390
Can you sometimes maybe
    talk to them, or


194
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.892
like, intimidate them?

195
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:52.392
I don't know.

196
00:08:52.392 --> 00:08:53.393
I'm asking.

197
00:08:53.393 --> 00:08:53.894
-You owe me some money, buddy.

198
00:08:53.893 --> 00:08:54.894
Remember?

199
00:08:54.894 --> 00:08:55.895
You have a gambling problem.

200
00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:56.396
Time to pay.

201
00:08:56.896 --> 00:08:57.397
Why-- no--

202
00:08:57.397 --> 00:08:58.899
I don't-- why you asking?

203
00:08:58.898 --> 00:08:59.899
-No, I'm just--

204
00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:01.901
-Are you, like, researching
    a book or something?


205
00:09:01.901 --> 00:09:02.652
What--

206
00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:03.736
-No, no.

207
00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:07.123
-What's going on?

208
00:09:11.627 --> 00:09:13.579
-I'm in trouble, man.

209
00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:14.497
-OK.

210
00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:22.588
-We got an eviction notice this
     morning, and, uh, if I


211
00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:25.591
don't pay in a few days, we're
   gonna be on the street.


212
00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:27.594
-Fuck.

213
00:09:27.593 --> 00:09:30.096
-I don't have a job since,
 like, an hour ago, so--


214
00:09:30.096 --> 00:09:31.648
-I'm sorry, man.

215
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.100
Look, I--

216
00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:36.652
I can help you out.

217
00:09:36.652 --> 00:09:37.653
I got a couple hundred bucks.

218
00:09:37.653 --> 00:09:43.742
-Look, I need 4,500.

219
00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:46.246
-Yeah, that's-- that's a little
       rich for my blood.


220
00:09:49.282 --> 00:09:51.751
So that's-- that's why
    you're asking?


221
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:52.201
You're looking for work?

222
00:09:52.752 --> 00:09:53.202
-Oh, no, no, no.

223
00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:55.288
No, just curious.

224
00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:56.873
-Yeah.

225
00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:04.381
You know, Craig, I once broke a
  guy's arm for $80 while his


226
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.882
daughter watched.

227
00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:10.887
You think you're capable of
 doing something like that?


228
00:10:21.697 --> 00:10:23.199
God, don't get so heavy.

229
00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:23.700
-I'm not.

230
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.701
I'm cool.

231
00:10:26.202 --> 00:10:27.203
-My god, you got so depressed
  over the last five years.


232
00:10:27.203 --> 00:10:28.121
-No, it's good.

233
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:28.655
It's good.

234
00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:29.706
I, uh--

235
00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:31.207
I'm gonna go drain.

236
00:10:31.207 --> 00:10:32.158
-All right.

237
00:10:32.158 --> 00:10:33.159
-I'll be right back.

238
00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:34.210
-Yeah.

239
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.212
Craig Daniels.

240
00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:39.215
Craig Daniels.

241
00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:40.717
God damn.

242
00:10:48.307 --> 00:10:51.477
[snorting]

243
00:10:51.477 --> 00:10:53.346
-Sorry.

244
00:10:53.346 --> 00:10:54.848
What's up?

245
00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:25.261
-Hey Craig.

246
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:27.263
These guys want to buy
 the next round, man.


247
00:11:27.263 --> 00:11:28.464
Come on, saddle up.

248
00:11:33.936 --> 00:11:38.858
They were just looking
for a little company.


249
00:11:38.858 --> 00:11:39.359
-Hey.

250
00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:40.860
Party, party.

251
00:11:45.448 --> 00:11:45.865
Cool.

252
00:11:45.865 --> 00:11:46.949
All right.

253
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:47.867
You guys like tequila?

254
00:11:47.867 --> 00:11:48.201
-Um, yeah.

255
00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:49.785
Yeah, sure.

256
00:11:49.785 --> 00:11:52.821
-Bartender, three shots of your
    finest tequila, please.


257
00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:53.823
You know-- wait-- hold--

258
00:11:53.823 --> 00:11:55.325
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:55.324 --> 00:11:57.543
Uh, just, matter of fact, give
     me the whole bottle.


260
00:11:57.543 --> 00:11:58.044
And the cranberry juice.

261
00:11:58.628 --> 00:11:59.129
-Yeah?

262
00:11:59.128 --> 00:11:59.962
What are your names?

263
00:11:59.962 --> 00:12:00.830
-I'm Colin.

264
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:01.331
This is my wife, Violet.

265
00:12:01.831 --> 00:12:02.332
-Hey, how you doing?

266
00:12:02.331 --> 00:12:02.798
I'm Vince.

267
00:12:02.798 --> 00:12:03.132
-Vince?

268
00:12:03.132 --> 00:12:04.216
All right.

269
00:12:04.717 --> 00:12:05.134
-Craig.

270
00:12:05.134 --> 00:12:06.469
-Craig.

271
00:12:06.469 --> 00:12:07.470
It's Violet's birthday today,
      so we thought we'd


272
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.471
go out on the town.

273
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:08.972
You know, get a little crazy.

274
00:12:08.971 --> 00:12:09.972
-Happy birthday.

275
00:12:09.972 --> 00:12:10.389
-Right?

276
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.723
-Thanks.

277
00:12:10.723 --> 00:12:11.757
There she is.

278
00:12:11.757 --> 00:12:12.308
Put it right there.

279
00:12:12.308 --> 00:12:13.810
-You sure?

280
00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:14.810
This is a $300 bottle
     of tequila.


281
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.811
-Oh, my.

282
00:12:15.811 --> 00:12:16.762
Oh, this is embarrassing.

283
00:12:16.762 --> 00:12:17.763
Uh--

284
00:12:17.763 --> 00:12:20.099
uh-- yeah, it's fine.

285
00:12:20.683 --> 00:12:21.184
What's your name?

286
00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:22.402
-Caren.

287
00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:22.985
-Caren with a K or a C?

288
00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:23.987
-C.

289
00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:26.155
-There you go, 
Caren with a C.

290
00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:27.239
-Thanks.

291
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.024
-The glasses come with?

292
00:12:28.024 --> 00:12:28.775
Oh, good.

293
00:12:35.698 --> 00:12:37.450
Gentlemen.

294
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.254
To my amazing wife, Violet.

295
00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:45.759
The past six months have been
     so fucking awesome.


296
00:12:45.758 --> 00:12:48.261
I love the shit out of you.

297
00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:50.263
-Love you too.

298
00:12:50.263 --> 00:12:51.765
-All right, to Violet.

299
00:12:54.016 --> 00:12:55.017
Oh.

300
00:12:55.017 --> 00:12:56.519
God damn.

301
00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:57.470
-That's smooth.

302
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.521
-Yeah, it's all right.

303
00:12:58.521 --> 00:12:59.472
I have this bottle at home.

304
00:12:59.472 --> 00:13:00.556
It used to belong
 to Pancho Villa.


305
00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:03.059
It cost me, like,
  what, $10,000.


306
00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:03.560
-What?

307
00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:05.111
-Yeah, isn't that crazy?

308
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:06.696
Uh, so anyway-- what do
 you guys-- what do you


309
00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:08.281
guys do for a living?

310
00:13:08.281 --> 00:13:10.733
Do you, like, uh, work at
 a car wash or something?


311
00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:12.785
-Oh, you mean because
 of the monkey suit?


312
00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:14.287
-Well, I didn't-- no offense.

313
00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:15.288
I assumed manager.

314
00:13:15.288 --> 00:13:16.122
-No, no, no.

315
00:13:16.122 --> 00:13:18.207
We're just old friends
     catching up,


316
00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:19.208
having a couple of drinks.

317
00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:19.959
-Right on.

318
00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:21.544
Old friends is good.

319
00:13:21.544 --> 00:13:22.495
-Yeah.

320
00:13:22.495 --> 00:13:23.463
No, we used to skateboard
        together.


321
00:13:23.963 --> 00:13:25.465
We played music in
   high school.


322
00:13:25.464 --> 00:13:26.382
-You guys go way deep.

323
00:13:26.382 --> 00:13:26.966
-Yeah.

324
00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:27.800
Yeah.

325
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.050
No, simpler times.

326
00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:29.135
Yep.

327
00:13:29.135 --> 00:13:31.587
-Occasionally.

328
00:13:31.587 --> 00:13:32.588
-Mystery man.

329
00:13:32.588 --> 00:13:33.089
Occasionally.

330
00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:34.090
Ber.

331
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.058
Bum.

332
00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:36.642
You should be wearing a suit
  and a tie or something.


333
00:13:36.642 --> 00:13:38.477
This guy-- ruh-ruh
   ruh-ruh-ruh.


334
00:13:38.477 --> 00:13:40.346
A very proper man.

335
00:13:40.346 --> 00:13:41.814
Oh, uh, Violet--

336
00:13:41.814 --> 00:13:43.265
we should, uh, take
   some candids.


337
00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:44.267
Take some-- take
 some pictures.


338
00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:45.518
We should document this, right?

339
00:13:45.518 --> 00:13:46.402
-OK--

340
00:13:46.402 --> 00:13:47.904
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Come on.

341
00:13:47.903 --> 00:13:49.405
-All right, you want to
  take some pictures?


342
00:13:49.405 --> 00:13:49.906
OK.

343
00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:50.406
Yeah, sure.

344
00:13:50.906 --> 00:13:51.907
-Say cheese.

345
00:13:51.907 --> 00:13:53.409
-Cheese.

346
00:13:53.409 --> 00:13:55.494
Oh god, that's bright.

347
00:13:55.494 --> 00:13:56.245
Oh.

348
00:13:56.245 --> 00:13:56.829
-Let me get in there.

349
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:58.331
-You want another one?

350
00:13:58.331 --> 00:13:58.915
OK.

351
00:13:59.915 --> 00:14:00.365
-Here we go.

352
00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:01.334
-One, two, three.

353
00:14:01.334 --> 00:14:02.418
-All right.

354
00:14:02.418 --> 00:14:03.953
Did you take it?

355
00:14:03.953 --> 00:14:05.455
How's it look?

356
00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.961
Ooh.

357
00:14:11.961 --> 00:14:13.463
Mm.

358
00:14:13.462 --> 00:14:14.380
Oh, here we go.

359
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.348
-What?

360
00:14:15.348 --> 00:14:16.349
What's going on?

361
00:14:16.349 --> 00:14:18.601
-We got this little bet going.

362
00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:20.520
You see that old dude
     at the bar?


363
00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:22.971
Every time he checks out the
bartender's ass, Violet wins.


364
00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:25.441
Every time he checks out
    her tits, I win.


365
00:14:27.893 --> 00:14:29.478
Motherfucker.

366
00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:30.980
-Wait, wait.

367
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.815
And that-- that's $100
  every single time?


368
00:14:32.815 --> 00:14:34.734
-Yeah, it's not, like, a serious
        bet or anything.


369
00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:36.236
-We have fun.

370
00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:37.737
-We have fun.

371
00:14:37.737 --> 00:14:38.705
I got an idea.

372
00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:39.238
Here we go.

373
00:14:39.238 --> 00:14:40.740
Idea man.

374
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.625
All right, whichever of
  you fellas does this


375
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:44.877
shot first gets $50.

376
00:14:44.877 --> 00:14:45.828
Boom.

377
00:14:45.828 --> 00:14:46.829
-$50?

378
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:47.830
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): $50.

379
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.831
-Wait, what?

380
00:14:48.831 --> 00:14:51.334
-Oh.

381
00:14:51.334 --> 00:14:52.335
Wins.

382
00:14:52.835 --> 00:14:53.836
Meanwhile-- wait, what?

383
00:14:57.423 --> 00:14:58.424
Pay attention.

384
00:14:58.424 --> 00:14:59.425
Pay attention.

385
00:14:59.425 --> 00:14:59.842
-That was short-lived.

386
00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:00.927
Here you go, buddy.

387
00:15:01.427 --> 00:15:01.928
-What are you doing?

388
00:15:01.927 --> 00:15:03.395
No no, he didn't
even do a shot.


389
00:15:03.396 --> 00:15:03.763
-No, it's all right.

390
00:15:04.347 --> 00:15:04.848
He--

391
00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:07.483
-No, that's your money.

392
00:15:07.933 --> 00:15:08.934
-All right.

393
00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:09.935
I won't argue.

394
00:15:09.935 --> 00:15:12.104
-Gotta play by the
   rules, guys.


395
00:15:12.104 --> 00:15:13.606
That's the only way
    to have fun.


396
00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:14.824
Shot game.

397
00:15:19.912 --> 00:15:22.782
You are a misfit.

398
00:15:22.782 --> 00:15:25.001
What island are you from?

399
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.002
[laughter]

400
00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:35.461
-Ah--

401
00:15:35.461 --> 00:15:38.047
-There he is.

402
00:15:38.047 --> 00:15:38.931
Aww.

403
00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:40.216
Fuck you, we're not
    gonna start.


404
00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:42.684
One dart, face.

405
00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:43.186
-On his face?

406
00:15:43.686 --> 00:15:44.187
-$50.

407
00:15:44.186 --> 00:15:45.137
-All right.

408
00:15:45.137 --> 00:15:45.688
All right.

409
00:15:45.688 --> 00:15:46.189
Here it goes.

410
00:15:46.188 --> 00:15:47.356
Ready?

411
00:15:47.356 --> 00:15:48.107
-Oh!

412
00:15:48.107 --> 00:15:49.191
-Oh, come on!

413
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:50.192
So close.

414
00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:51.193
-Oh my god.

415
00:15:51.193 --> 00:15:51.694
Hold on.

416
00:15:51.694 --> 00:15:52.195
Check her out.

417
00:15:52.695 --> 00:15:53.196
Check her out.

418
00:15:53.195 --> 00:15:53.645
There.

419
00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:54.030
-Who?

420
00:15:54.563 --> 00:15:55.114
-Black dress.

421
00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:56.616
-Oh god.

422
00:15:56.615 --> 00:15:58.867
No, that's-- that's a rough
 stretch woman right there.


423
00:15:58.868 --> 00:15:59.369
-Pfft.

424
00:15:59.368 --> 00:16:00.369
-It's really rough.

425
00:16:00.369 --> 00:16:01.370
OK, here we go.

426
00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:06.743
All right, um, $200 to anyone
  who gets her so pissed she


427
00:16:06.742 --> 00:16:08.244
slaps your face.

428
00:16:08.244 --> 00:16:09.245
-$200?

429
00:16:09.245 --> 00:16:10.246
-200.

430
00:16:10.246 --> 00:16:11.748
You want to take this?

431
00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:12.998
-I don't know.

432
00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:14.299
-Look, if you don't step
  up, I'm gonna, man.


433
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.301
That's 200 bones.

434
00:16:19.722 --> 00:16:20.723
-All right.

435
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.593
-She's just gonna slap you.

436
00:16:23.592 --> 00:16:25.094
She's just gonna slap you.

437
00:16:29.315 --> 00:16:30.817
-Hey.

438
00:16:31.317 --> 00:16:32.318
-Yeah?

439
00:16:32.318 --> 00:16:33.319
What?

440
00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:34.821
-What?

441
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:38.607
-What-- what-- what the fuck
    do you want, creep?


442
00:16:38.607 --> 00:16:39.608
Huh?

443
00:16:40.025 --> 00:16:41.109
-Did you-- did you
 go to Parkside?


444
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.612
I'm sorry, I thought you
  were somebody else.


445
00:16:42.611 --> 00:16:44.746
I'm sorry.

446
00:16:44.747 --> 00:16:45.831
-He's walking back.

447
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:46.832
-Walking back.

448
00:16:46.832 --> 00:16:47.333
-He's walking back.

449
00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:48.918
He's walking back.

450
00:16:48.918 --> 00:16:50.503
-All right, you know what?

451
00:16:50.503 --> 00:16:51.504
Watch the master at work.

452
00:16:51.504 --> 00:16:53.506
OK?

453
00:16:53.506 --> 00:16:54.874
Excuse me.

454
00:17:03.883 --> 00:17:04.634
-Oh!

455
00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:05.634
-Oh!

456
00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:09.388
[laughter]

457
00:17:09.388 --> 00:17:10.356
-Pay up, brother.

458
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.891
-How'd you get her to do that?

459
00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:12.892
-I told her I'd buy
 her a drink if she


460
00:17:12.892 --> 00:17:13.443
slapped me in the face.

461
00:17:13.442 --> 00:17:16.395
[groaning]

462
00:17:16.395 --> 00:17:17.396
-What?

463
00:17:17.897 --> 00:17:19.399
-It's a little bit of a cheat,
 but I'm gonna let it slide.


464
00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:20.867
I'm gonna let it slide.

465
00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:22.401
-Whoa, put that shit away.

466
00:17:22.902 --> 00:17:23.903
-Sh.

467
00:17:23.903 --> 00:17:24.904
Dude, there's enough
   for everyone.


468
00:17:24.904 --> 00:17:25.788
-No, no, no.

469
00:17:25.788 --> 00:17:27.373
Take it in the bathroom
     or something.


470
00:17:27.373 --> 00:17:29.876
-Hey, I am--

471
00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:31.377
I am comfortable here.

472
00:17:31.377 --> 00:17:32.879
That bathroom stinks,
      all right?


473
00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:33.879
-Oh, she's coming.

474
00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:34.880
She's coming over now.

475
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.881
She's coming over now.

476
00:17:35.881 --> 00:17:37.466
-Hey, you guys can't
   do that here.


477
00:17:37.466 --> 00:17:39.084
[snorting]

478
00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:41.553
-Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

479
00:17:41.554 --> 00:17:42.588
Caren--

480
00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:44.890
let me fix this.

481
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.642
It feels broken to me.

482
00:17:46.642 --> 00:17:47.643
Here.

483
00:17:47.643 --> 00:17:48.594
That's like a curtain.

484
00:17:48.978 --> 00:17:51.564
You can't even see
over here, right?


485
00:17:51.564 --> 00:17:53.015
Caren.

486
00:17:53.015 --> 00:17:54.934
You's the best.

487
00:17:54.934 --> 00:17:56.436
Thank you, Caren.

488
00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:00.940
[chuckling]

489
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:01.941
-All right, can I--

490
00:18:01.941 --> 00:18:02.942
-Please, hit it.

491
00:18:02.942 --> 00:18:03.910
-Oh, yeah.

492
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:05.244
-Where are we going next?

493
00:18:05.244 --> 00:18:06.245
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You want
    to move-- move camp?


494
00:18:06.245 --> 00:18:06.746
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

495
00:18:06.745 --> 00:18:08.747
-Um, ooh--

496
00:18:08.747 --> 00:18:10.749
I know a really good
    strip club.


497
00:18:10.749 --> 00:18:12.251
Are you all right strip clubs?

498
00:18:12.251 --> 00:18:13.753
It's a really classy joint.

499
00:18:13.752 --> 00:18:14.253
-Yes.

500
00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:15.754
-She's OK with that?

501
00:18:15.754 --> 00:18:16.755
Want to get a couple
 lap dances, buddy?


502
00:18:16.755 --> 00:18:17.256
-No, no, no.

503
00:18:17.706 --> 00:18:18.707
I gotta go home.

504
00:18:18.707 --> 00:18:19.208
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Boo, Craig.

505
00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:19.625
-For real?

506
00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:20.709
That's not--

507
00:18:20.709 --> 00:18:21.710

00:26:18.487 --> 00:26:22.408
-I don't even remember,
        really.


672
00:26:22.407 --> 00:26:24.910
-I used to watched the older
  kids in my neighborhood


673
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.497
skateboard when I was
    a little girl.


674
00:26:28.497 --> 00:26:29.581
-Yeah?

675
00:26:32.084 --> 00:26:38.591
-There was this one boy that
 I sort of had a crush on.


676
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.593
He was always trying harder
    than all the others.


677
00:26:41.593 --> 00:26:48.600
And I remember one time he was
   trying to do this trick.


678
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.520
And they had set up a
  jump on the curb.


679
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.522
He was trying to
 pick up speed.


680
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:58.643
And this SUV whipped
 around the corner.


681
00:27:02.647 --> 00:27:06.651
I didn't actually see it
happen, but I heard it.


682
00:27:09.154 --> 00:27:13.158
The sound that it made
   when it hit him.


683
00:27:13.158 --> 00:27:16.161
It was so strange.

684
00:27:16.161 --> 00:27:20.165
It sounded like--

685
00:27:20.165 --> 00:27:21.667
like branches snapping.

686
00:27:26.922 --> 00:27:29.425
It sounded like he was
  made out of wood.


687
00:27:35.597 --> 00:27:38.100
-So the first thing they see
    that allows them the


688
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:38.601
right to meet you.

689
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.601
Here you go.

690
00:27:39.601 --> 00:27:41.103
This should do it.

691
00:27:41.103 --> 00:27:42.104
-What is it?

692
00:27:42.604 --> 00:27:45.107
-Uh, I think they're
     Percocets.


693
00:27:45.107 --> 00:27:46.609
I think.

694
00:27:46.608 --> 00:27:48.610
But nothing a doctor
wouldn't prescribe.


695
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.579
So you're fine.

696
00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:52.080
In the clear.

697
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.081
[snorting]

698
00:27:58.587 --> 00:28:00.289
-[whispers]

699
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:01.757
-All right, gang.

700
00:28:01.756 --> 00:28:03.207
Let's-- let's head outside.

701
00:28:03.708 --> 00:28:04.209
-Yeah.

702
00:28:04.709 --> 00:28:05.210
-Come on.

703
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:06.211
I want to show you something.

704
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:08.714
-Come on, Craig.

705
00:28:08.713 --> 00:28:10.682
Come on, you got a little
       patched up?


706
00:28:15.554 --> 00:28:17.056
Move it, buddy.

707
00:28:17.556 --> 00:28:19.558
Ooh.

708
00:28:19.558 --> 00:28:21.026
-Killer view, right?

709
00:28:21.026 --> 00:28:22.528
-Yeah.

710
00:28:22.527 --> 00:28:24.396
-Yeah, I have a-- another place
     by the water in Palos


711
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.983
Verdes and a condo in Malibu.

712
00:28:27.983 --> 00:28:28.984
But this is all--

713
00:28:28.984 --> 00:28:30.953
this is all Violet's
  baby right here.


714
00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:34.372
I just gave her the checkbook
and I said, hey, whatever you


715
00:28:34.372 --> 00:28:36.791
create are my desires.

716
00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:37.909
And clearly she's
 doing it, right?


717
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:40.495
She put together every
     inch of it.


718
00:28:43.498 --> 00:28:44.499
-What?

719
00:28:49.754 --> 00:28:51.256
Oh, what the fuck?

720
00:28:51.256 --> 00:28:52.390
[laughter]

721
00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.975
-Fuck off.

722
00:28:56.478 --> 00:28:56.979
-Craig, wait, wait, wait, wait.

723
00:28:57.479 --> 00:28:57.980
Come here.

724
00:28:57.979 --> 00:28:58.480
Don't be like that.

725
00:28:58.930 --> 00:28:59.898
Come here, man.

726
00:29:00.432 --> 00:29:02.434
Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig.

727
00:29:02.434 --> 00:29:03.352
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

728
00:29:03.351 --> 00:29:05.653
Stop, stop, stop.

729
00:29:05.654 --> 00:29:06.655
-Oh, what are you gonna
 take a shit on me now?


730
00:29:06.655 --> 00:29:08.157
Get the fuck out of here.

731
00:29:08.156 --> 00:29:09.157
-Relax, man.

732
00:29:09.157 --> 00:29:10.659
That was for $300, all right?

733
00:29:10.659 --> 00:29:11.660
You would have done the
   same exact thing.


734
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.661
-Oh, yeah?

735
00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:14.029
You think so?

736
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.589
-I'm gonna rob him.

737
00:29:24.589 --> 00:29:25.673
-What?

738
00:29:25.674 --> 00:29:26.375
-This fucking idiot has
    got a safe-full


739
00:29:26.374 --> 00:29:27.458
of cash in his office.

740
00:29:27.959 --> 00:29:28.960
I'm gonna take it.

741
00:29:34.466 --> 00:29:37.552
-Are you insane, you
    fucking ape?


742
00:29:37.552 --> 00:29:39.554
I just want to get
   out of here.


743
00:29:39.854 --> 00:29:44.559
-There is, like, $150,000
    in cash in there.


744
00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.611
Now, for him, that's a
 drop in the bucket.


745
00:29:46.611 --> 00:29:49.030
But for us, that's a whole
      new life, man.


746
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.398
Think about it.

747
00:29:50.398 --> 00:29:51.983
-I'm not gonna rob him.

748
00:29:51.983 --> 00:29:53.368
-OK, fine.

749
00:29:53.368 --> 00:29:57.622
That's fine, but the last time
 I checked you needed money.


750
00:29:57.622 --> 00:29:59.207
This right here, this
 is your opportunity.


751
00:29:59.658 --> 00:30:02.211
-Yeah, my opportunity
   to get arrested.


752
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.578
He's seen our faces.

753
00:30:03.578 --> 00:30:04.462
He knows our names.

754
00:30:04.462 --> 00:30:05.496
-He's not calling the cops.

755
00:30:05.497 --> 00:30:06.665
He's not gonna call them.

756
00:30:06.665 --> 00:30:10.252
-That is a really crazy
      assumption.


757
00:30:10.502 --> 00:30:11.219
No, it's not.

758
00:30:11.219 --> 00:30:12.804
Not when you think about it.

759
00:30:12.804 --> 00:30:15.807
Any fucking cop that isn't blind
      is going to take one


760
00:30:15.807 --> 00:30:18.310
look at his dilated pupils and
   throw him in jail right


761
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.311
alongside of us.

762
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:20.812
He's not calling the cops.

763
00:30:24.899 --> 00:30:29.153
Now look, I'm doing
  this either way.


764
00:30:29.154 --> 00:30:33.191
Now, if you don't want to be a
 part of it, you should leave


765
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:34.192
right fucking now.

766
00:30:40.081 --> 00:30:41.833
-Wait, wait, wait.

767
00:30:46.671 --> 00:30:50.175
What am I supposed to do?

768
00:30:50.175 --> 00:30:52.210
-Just hold the girl,
     all right?


769
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.962
I'll take care of the rest.

770
00:30:54.179 --> 00:30:55.263
-You're not gonna hurt
    him, are you?


771
00:30:55.263 --> 00:30:56.097
-No.

772
00:30:56.097 --> 00:30:57.682
No, I'm not gonna fucking--

773
00:30:57.682 --> 00:30:58.683
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): You guys
 jerking each other off in


774
00:30:58.683 --> 00:30:59.684
there or something?

775
00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:02.604
-Why, you want to come
  in here and watch?


776
00:31:02.604 --> 00:31:04.189
Nobody's getting hurt.

777
00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:06.608
Just grab violet and
   hold on tight.


778
00:31:19.788 --> 00:31:23.125
-You bros kiss and make up?

779
00:31:23.124 --> 00:31:24.075
-Yeah.

780
00:31:24.075 --> 00:31:24.459
-Ding, ding.

781
00:31:24.459 --> 00:31:26.044
-Ooh.

782
00:31:26.044 --> 00:31:28.330
-Violet's got all of her music
  hooked up with the stereo.


783
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.333
So there's, like, 12,000
  tunes we can listen


784
00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:32.134
to on shuffle, right?

785
00:31:32.384 --> 00:31:34.469
Play that crazy instrumental
           honey.


786
00:31:34.469 --> 00:31:38.089
Oh you know, it's the one with
   the-- with the strings.


787
00:31:38.556 --> 00:31:39.590
Ooh, or just play this one.

788
00:31:39.591 --> 00:31:41.093
This is actually the
    better vibe.


789
00:31:41.092 --> 00:31:42.594
Better for the vibe, actually.

790
00:31:42.594 --> 00:31:43.979
Here's your cocktail.

791
00:31:43.978 --> 00:31:45.563
Uh, are you girls done
with the ladies room?


792
00:31:46.064 --> 00:31:47.232
'Cause I gotta pee.

793
00:31:47.732 --> 00:31:48.182
-Yeah.

794
00:31:48.183 --> 00:31:48.767
Yeah.

795
00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:50.936
Hey, uh, Colin--

796
00:31:50.935 --> 00:31:53.938
well, I hate to do
   this to you.


797
00:31:53.938 --> 00:31:55.323
-What the fuck, man?

798
00:31:55.323 --> 00:31:56.825
-I'm gonna need all the
  money in that safe.


799
00:31:56.825 --> 00:31:58.410
-Dude, this is fucking really
      stupid, all right?


800
00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.028
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

801
00:32:00.028 --> 00:32:01.530
Now, you and I are gonna
    wait right here.


802
00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:02.997
Craig's gonna get
  it for us, OK?


803
00:32:03.415 --> 00:32:04.499
What's the combination?

804
00:32:04.499 --> 00:32:05.250
-Combination?

805
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:05.450
I--

806
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:06.418
I--

807
00:32:06.418 --> 00:32:06.752
I don't--

808
00:32:07.335 --> 00:32:08.837
-Look, don't fuck with me, OK?

809
00:32:08.837 --> 00:32:10.339
-Dude, you fucking
 gotta chill, OK?


810
00:32:10.338 --> 00:32:12.507
We got a good party going
     here, all right?


811
00:32:12.507 --> 00:32:14.426
-Tell me the combination.

812
00:32:14.426 --> 00:32:17.512
-I told you, I don't know it.

813
00:32:17.512 --> 00:32:18.513
It's not locked, Vince.

814
00:32:19.013 --> 00:32:19.764
-You fucking shitting me?

815
00:32:19.764 --> 00:32:21.766
You expect me to believe that?

816
00:32:21.766 --> 00:32:22.717
-I--

817
00:32:22.717 --> 00:32:24.219
I can't remember the
numerical sequence.


818
00:32:24.719 --> 00:32:25.687
OK?

819
00:32:26.221 --> 00:32:28.223
It was her birthday and then
I changed it to her social.


820
00:32:28.723 --> 00:32:29.941
I can't-- it's not
 fucking locked.


821
00:32:29.941 --> 00:32:32.527
-It's a safe-full of cash.

822
00:32:32.527 --> 00:32:33.478
-Well, I guess I--

823
00:32:34.028 --> 00:32:35.029
I, uh--

824
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:38.032
I guess trust my bros
    too much, huh?


825
00:32:38.032 --> 00:32:38.783
-You know what?

826
00:32:38.783 --> 00:32:41.369
Hey Craig, you're gonna
      handle this.


827
00:32:41.369 --> 00:32:42.370
Come here.

828
00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:42.871
Just walk over to the couch.

829
00:32:42.871 --> 00:32:43.372
Come on.

830
00:32:43.872 --> 00:32:44.373
Sit down, sit down.

831
00:32:44.372 --> 00:32:45.323
Sit down.

832
00:32:45.874 --> 00:32:47.075
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): What
   do I do with her?


833
00:32:47.075 --> 00:32:47.659
-Just-- just put her on
 the couch next to him.


834
00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:48.160
-OK.

835
00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:51.162
Watch your--

836
00:32:51.162 --> 00:32:52.664
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Don't
  do anything stupid.


837
00:33:09.898 --> 00:33:10.899
-Uh-huh.

838
00:33:10.899 --> 00:33:11.850
All right.

839
00:33:15.403 --> 00:33:16.404
Whoa.

840
00:33:29.417 --> 00:33:30.335
-You keep it unlocked?

841
00:33:30.335 --> 00:33:32.254
What are you, fucking stupid?

842
00:33:32.253 --> 00:33:33.254
Come on, bro.

843
00:33:33.254 --> 00:33:34.255
Come on.

844
00:33:55.276 --> 00:33:57.228
-Ah, fucking cock.

845
00:33:57.228 --> 00:33:59.447
-What's taking so long, Craig?

846
00:33:59.447 --> 00:34:00.365
-Give me a sec.

847
00:34:12.627 --> 00:34:12.961
Let's go.

848
00:34:12.961 --> 00:34:13.712
I got it.

849
00:34:13.711 --> 00:34:14.579
-You got all of it?

850
00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:14.913
-Yeah, yeah.

851
00:34:14.913 --> 00:34:15.831
Come on.

852
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:16.748
-How much was in there?

853
00:34:16.748 --> 00:34:17.249
-I don't know.

854
00:34:17.248 --> 00:34:18.166
I didn't count it.

855
00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:19.134
Let's get the fuck
   out of here.


856
00:34:19.133 --> 00:34:19.583
-All right.

857
00:34:20.051 --> 00:34:20.885
Yeah.

858
00:34:20.885 --> 00:34:21.669
You know what, Colin?

859
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.471
I'm also gonna need
  those car keys.


860
00:34:23.471 --> 00:34:25.423
-Oh, uh, I think they're on the
    shelf right over there.


861
00:34:34.649 --> 00:34:36.734
-Fucking cool it.

862
00:34:36.734 --> 00:34:38.352
Take a fucking moment.

863
00:34:38.353 --> 00:34:41.523
-I just want to say, this
     was not my idea.


864
00:34:41.523 --> 00:34:42.441
He came up with the idea.

865
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.858
I told him it was a bad idea.

866
00:34:43.858 --> 00:34:45.076
-Shut it.

867
00:34:45.076 --> 00:34:47.528
Let's all just chill for a
fucking moment, all right?


868
00:34:47.529 --> 00:34:48.447
Let's hit pause.

869
00:34:48.446 --> 00:34:48.997
-(MUFFLED) Yeah.

870
00:34:49.531 --> 00:34:50.532
-OK.

871
00:34:50.532 --> 00:34:51.366
-Want to?

872
00:34:51.366 --> 00:34:51.950
-Yeah.

873
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:52.918
-Hey, how about we pretend?

874
00:34:53.368 --> 00:34:54.286
You want to pretend something?

875
00:34:54.285 --> 00:34:55.286
Let's-- let's pretend.

876
00:34:55.787 --> 00:34:56.705
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You're
      fake bullies.


877
00:34:56.704 --> 00:34:57.205
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
 Yeah, that's it.


878
00:34:57.789 --> 00:34:58.456
Good, Vince.

879
00:34:58.456 --> 00:34:59.040
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): OK.

880
00:35:01.843 --> 00:35:06.848
-Let's just pretend these
  last 15 minutes didn't


881
00:35:06.848 --> 00:35:08.350
even happen, all right?

882
00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:09.351
-What do you mean, dude?

883
00:35:09.767 --> 00:35:10.601
We just tried to rob you.

884
00:35:10.602 --> 00:35:12.053
-Yeah, that was really
    fucking lame.


885
00:35:12.387 --> 00:35:15.023
That was really fucking
        stupid.


886
00:35:15.023 --> 00:35:18.810
All right, listen, Violet and
  I haven't necessarily been


887
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.812
honest with you guys either,
  but we're willing to let


888
00:35:20.812 --> 00:35:22.614
bygones be bygones, all right?

889
00:35:22.614 --> 00:35:23.148
-OK.

890
00:35:23.698 --> 00:35:24.699
Bygones are bygones.

891
00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:26.818
We did not try to rob you.

892
00:35:26.818 --> 00:35:28.370
I didn't just hold a knife
     to your throat.


893
00:35:28.369 --> 00:35:29.403
-I know, Vince.

894
00:35:29.404 --> 00:35:31.456
I just said fucking rewind.

895
00:35:31.823 --> 00:35:32.824
That doesn't exist.

896
00:35:32.824 --> 00:35:33.742
The past-- shut the fuck up.

897
00:35:33.741 --> 00:35:34.992
The past is the past,
      all right?


898
00:35:34.993 --> 00:35:36.578
We're in the present.

899
00:35:36.578 --> 00:35:37.546
Didn't exist.

900
00:35:37.912 --> 00:35:39.297
Let's start over.

901
00:35:39.297 --> 00:35:40.799
Let's reset.

902
00:35:40.798 --> 00:35:42.300
I'm cool with it.

903
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.586
Are you cool with it?

904
00:35:44.586 --> 00:35:46.004
OK.

905
00:35:46.004 --> 00:35:47.088
Guys, all right,
 so we're cool.


906
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:48.590
-We're cool.

907
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.975
-Let's push play.

908
00:35:49.974 --> 00:35:51.342
-You're not gonna call
   the cops on us?


909
00:35:51.342 --> 00:35:53.144
-I'm not gonna call the
  fucking cops, cross


910
00:35:53.144 --> 00:35:54.178
my heart, all right?

911
00:35:54.679 --> 00:35:59.067
-So-- what-- what the
  fuck is this, huh?


912
00:35:59.067 --> 00:36:00.068
What the fuck is this?

913
00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:02.403
-This is Violet's
 birthday, guys.


914
00:36:02.403 --> 00:36:03.437
What am I gonna get this girl?

915
00:36:03.438 --> 00:36:05.323
Look at her, she's a vision.

916
00:36:05.607 --> 00:36:06.691
My God.

917
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:07.692
That girl's got everything.

918
00:36:07.692 --> 00:36:09.160
She can but everything
      she wants.


919
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.078
You gotta think outside
     the box, guys.


920
00:36:10.078 --> 00:36:13.114
So Violet and I came
 up with this idea


921
00:36:13.114 --> 00:36:14.616
for an awesome night.

922
00:36:14.616 --> 00:36:16.585
-You gonna find a couple of
losers, you pay them a bunch


923
00:36:16.584 --> 00:36:20.088
of money, and you laugh your
asses off while they humiliate


924
00:36:20.088 --> 00:36:21.039
themselves.

925
00:36:21.039 --> 00:36:21.590
Awesome fucking night.

926
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:22.090
Happy birthday.

927
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.007
-Stop.

928
00:36:23.007 --> 00:36:23.341
Come on.

929
00:36:23.925 --> 00:36:24.375
Are you kidding me?

930
00:36:24.792 --> 00:36:25.293
You guys aren't losers.

931
00:36:25.293 --> 00:36:26.377
You're fucking awesome.

932
00:36:26.377 --> 00:36:27.461
This has been a night, right?

933
00:36:27.462 --> 00:36:28.964
This has been fucking amazing.

934
00:36:28.963 --> 00:36:32.850
This is more-- this is more
 like a reality game show.


935
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.935
-What reality game show?

936
00:36:34.936 --> 00:36:37.639
-You know, the game shows
    when they gobble,


937
00:36:37.639 --> 00:36:39.641
like, animal dicks.

938
00:36:39.641 --> 00:36:41.143
They make them do that.

939
00:36:41.142 --> 00:36:42.727
Or put their head in a bucket
  of snakes or eat bugs, you


940
00:36:42.727 --> 00:36:43.811
know, shit like that.

941
00:36:44.278 --> 00:36:45.729
Except this isn't TV.

942
00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:46.981
Right?

943
00:36:46.981 --> 00:36:50.535
That and there's 250,000
   tax-free dollars.


944
00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:54.372
-$250,000?

945
00:36:54.372 --> 00:36:55.823
-What?

946
00:36:57.375 --> 00:36:59.294
This money's for us?

947
00:36:59.293 --> 00:37:01.328
-Yeah, down.

948
00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:02.881
-Fucking down.

949
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.381
-I'm down.

950
00:37:03.881 --> 00:37:04.215
I'm down, Colin.

951
00:37:04.465 --> 00:37:05.049
I'm down.

952
00:37:05.049 --> 00:37:05.550
-Fucking stay down, Vince.

953
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.051
-OK.

954
00:37:06.501 --> 00:37:07.552
OK.

955
00:37:08.052 --> 00:37:09.921
-It's cool, bro.

956
00:37:09.921 --> 00:37:11.339
It's cool.

957
00:37:13.841 --> 00:37:14.842
-You gotta win it.

958
00:37:14.842 --> 00:37:16.177
That's-- you know.

959
00:37:19.263 --> 00:37:21.265
You know what's funny?

960
00:37:21.766 --> 00:37:24.435
This money that was in the safe
   was for the fucking game.


961
00:37:24.902 --> 00:37:28.939
And we were gonna give it to
 you, and you guys took it.


962
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.442
You know what that's like?

963
00:37:30.441 --> 00:37:31.943
Um--

964
00:37:31.943 --> 00:37:33.328
there's a word for it.

965
00:37:33.911 --> 00:37:34.412
-Irony?

966
00:37:34.412 --> 00:37:35.246
-Thank you.

967
00:37:35.246 --> 00:37:36.581
Super irony is what it is.

968
00:37:36.581 --> 00:37:38.083
Super fucking irony.

969
00:37:38.082 --> 00:37:39.867
-What-- what do we have to do?

970
00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:42.336
-Whatever we say.

971
00:37:42.336 --> 00:37:43.871
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You're not--
    you're not-- you're not


972
00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:46.874
gonna call the cops on us?

973
00:37:46.874 --> 00:37:48.876
-Call the cops on you?

974
00:37:48.876 --> 00:37:51.846
No, I'm not gonna call the
   fucking cops on you.


975
00:37:51.846 --> 00:37:53.881
-And we can leave whenever
       we want to?


976
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:55.549
-I'd be bummed.

977
00:37:57.468 --> 00:37:59.053
I really would.

978
00:37:59.053 --> 00:38:00.555
But you're free to go.

979
00:38:01.055 --> 00:38:02.056
You're free to go.

980
00:38:07.729 --> 00:38:08.697
You wouldn't get this.

981
00:38:25.713 --> 00:38:26.714
-OK.

982
00:38:28.499 --> 00:38:30.301
But let me tell you this, no
 matter how much money's in


983
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:32.303
that box, I am not
sucking his dick.


984
00:38:32.303 --> 00:38:33.471
-Oh--

985
00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:38.059
no dudes boning dudes or
  blowing each other.


986
00:38:38.059 --> 00:38:39.060
No.

987
00:38:39.393 --> 00:38:40.728
You just have to do
  whatever we say.


988
00:38:40.728 --> 00:38:41.729
Not that.

989
00:38:44.732 --> 00:38:46.234
-All right.

990
00:38:46.234 --> 00:38:48.737
So what-- what-- what--
     do I gotta do?


991
00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:50.688
-All right!

992
00:38:50.688 --> 00:38:52.990
We're back.

993
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.991
Good decision.

994
00:38:53.991 --> 00:38:55.493
How about this.

995
00:38:55.493 --> 00:38:57.578
$500 to whoever can hold their
     breath the longest.


996
00:38:57.578 --> 00:38:58.579
-That's it?

997
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.998
Yeah, I'm game.

998
00:38:59.997 --> 00:39:00.498
Come on.

999
00:39:00.498 --> 00:39:01.916
[ringtone]

1000
00:39:01.916 --> 00:39:03.000
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  There you go.


1001
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:03.501
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

1002
00:39:03.501 --> 00:39:03.951
I'm down.

1003
00:39:03.951 --> 00:39:05.536
I'm game.

1004
00:39:05.536 --> 00:39:07.038
I just hold my breath?

1005
00:39:07.038 --> 00:39:09.290
-Yeah, longer than he does.

1006
00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:09.757
-OK.

1007
00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:10.841
I'm going first.

1008
00:39:10.842 --> 00:39:11.843
You timing me?

1009
00:39:11.843 --> 00:39:12.961
-All right.

1010
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.961
-Yeah, you ready?

1011
00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:14.962
-Yep.

1012
00:39:14.962 --> 00:39:16.464
-Craig, hey.

1013
00:39:16.464 --> 00:39:17.966
You said you were just going
      out for a drink.


1014
00:39:17.965 --> 00:39:20.184
It's 2:00 AM.

1015
00:39:21.185 --> 00:39:21.719
I'm sorry.

1016
00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:23.804
I, uh, lost track of time.

1017
00:39:23.805 --> 00:39:24.806
Enrique and I--

1018
00:39:24.806 --> 00:39:25.807
-I--

1019
00:39:25.807 --> 00:39:26.308
I talked to Enrique.

1020
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:32.947
-Then I guess he told
  you what happened.


1021
00:39:33.481 --> 00:39:34.032
-Baby, look.

1022
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:34.532
I'm not mad.

1023
00:39:34.532 --> 00:39:35.983
OK?

1024
00:39:35.983 --> 00:39:37.451
Just come home.

1025
00:39:40.204 --> 00:39:42.406
Just come home and we'll--
   we'll figure it out.


1026
00:39:46.043 --> 00:39:47.545
Craig.

1027
00:39:49.547 --> 00:39:51.049
-I'm coming home.

1028
00:39:51.048 --> 00:39:53.551
Just give me 45 minutes.

1029
00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:59.006
Trust me.

1030
00:39:59.006 --> 00:40:00.841
-Craig, $300 to hang
   up the phone.


1031
00:40:00.842 --> 00:40:01.343
-Who is that?

1032
00:40:01.342 --> 00:40:02.476
-Listen--

1033
00:40:02.476 --> 00:40:03.477
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  Now it's 200.


1034
00:40:03.477 --> 00:40:03.978
AUDREY (ON PHONE): Babe--

1035
00:40:04.478 --> 00:40:05.095
[beep]

1036
00:40:05.096 --> 00:40:07.682
-Aw, we gotta pay.

1037
00:40:08.182 --> 00:40:08.683
Oh shit, hold on.

1038
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.685
Hold on.

1039
00:40:10.685 --> 00:40:11.186
Oh my god.

1040
00:40:11.185 --> 00:40:13.688
1:59, you motherfucker.

1041
00:40:13.688 --> 00:40:15.190
Holy shit.

1042
00:40:15.189 --> 00:40:17.158
Oh, you don't get
 a taste of this?


1043
00:40:17.158 --> 00:40:18.326
-What was that?

1044
00:40:18.326 --> 00:40:19.360
Why'd you just give him money?

1045
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.913
-I gave him $200 to hang
    up on his wife.


1046
00:40:21.913 --> 00:40:22.414
He did it.

1047
00:40:22.413 --> 00:40:23.497
-$200?

1048
00:40:24.081 --> 00:40:24.865
What?

1049
00:40:24.866 --> 00:40:25.784
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, yeah.

1050
00:40:25.783 --> 00:40:26.867
-All right, my turn now?

1051
00:40:26.868 --> 00:40:27.535
-Your turn, Craig.

1052
00:40:27.535 --> 00:40:29.787
Are you ready?

1053
00:40:29.787 --> 00:40:31.172
-Yeah.

1054
00:40:31.172 --> 00:40:35.793
-Three, two, one, go.

1055
00:40:35.793 --> 00:40:36.761
-That's--

1056
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:37.428
that's not fair.

1057
00:40:37.428 --> 00:40:38.012
-What's not fair?

1058
00:40:38.512 --> 00:40:39.513
-You give--

1059
00:40:40.014 --> 00:40:42.517
-I get to decide.

1060
00:40:43.017 --> 00:40:44.519
-All right, how much-- how
  much time did I have?


1061
00:40:44.518 --> 00:40:47.021
-You were one minute,
     58 seconds.


1062
00:40:47.021 --> 00:40:48.523
-OK.

1063
00:40:52.643 --> 00:40:53.144
-Oh.

1064
00:40:53.644 --> 00:40:54.145
-How you doing, buddy?

1065
00:40:54.145 --> 00:40:54.646
Huh?

1066
00:40:54.645 --> 00:40:56.564
You all right?

1067
00:40:56.564 --> 00:40:57.982
You know, it actually
   really starts to


1068
00:40:57.982 --> 00:40:59.400
hurt after one minute.

1069
00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:02.987
No, you know what?

1070
00:41:02.987 --> 00:41:04.455
I think he's about to blow.

1071
00:41:04.956 --> 00:41:07.375
-He actually looks better than
    you did at that point.


1072
00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:11.379
-Yeah, I think he's got
    this in the bag.


1073
00:41:11.712 --> 00:41:14.882
I saw this documentary where
guys that dive for lobsters


1074
00:41:14.882 --> 00:41:16.417
can go, like, five minutes.

1075
00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:17.335
-What?

1076
00:41:17.335 --> 00:41:19.721
Huh, that doesn't help?

1077
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.638
What?

1078
00:41:20.638 --> 00:41:23.841
What, it's just a little poke.

1079
00:41:23.841 --> 00:41:26.894
What, huh?

1080
00:41:26.894 --> 00:41:27.928
-Oh, shit, bitch.

1081
00:41:27.929 --> 00:41:30.899
He's going to reach you.

1082
00:41:30.898 --> 00:41:36.937
53, 54, 55--

1083
00:41:41.409 --> 00:41:43.278
oh shit!

1084
00:41:43.277 --> 00:41:44.328
-Ha, ha, ha!

1085
00:41:44.328 --> 00:41:45.279
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh!

1086
00:41:45.279 --> 00:41:46.747
-Fuck, Vince.

1087
00:41:46.747 --> 00:41:47.331
-Pay up.

1088
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:49.333
-That got hairy.

1089
00:41:49.333 --> 00:41:51.418
-You serious?

1090
00:41:51.919 --> 00:41:52.336
You pay him?

1091
00:41:52.336 --> 00:41:53.370
He just cheated.

1092
00:41:53.371 --> 00:41:55.039
-I didn't set any rules.

1093
00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:55.706
-Relax, man.

1094
00:41:55.706 --> 00:41:56.757
We're just having fun.

1095
00:41:59.427 --> 00:42:00.428
-What's next?

1096
00:42:00.428 --> 00:42:02.764
-Oh, I like that.

1097
00:42:02.763 --> 00:42:05.766
Let's go back out
 front, shall we?


1098
00:42:10.771 --> 00:42:12.556
This-a-way.

1099
00:42:12.556 --> 00:42:14.475
Let's go this way.

1100
00:42:23.234 --> 00:42:25.236
Look at that.

1101
00:42:25.236 --> 00:42:27.238
You see that shit?

1102
00:42:27.238 --> 00:42:28.122
-That's shit.

1103
00:42:28.622 --> 00:42:29.490
-Yes, that's what I said.

1104
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.574
That shit.

1105
00:42:30.574 --> 00:42:31.825
-Wait, you-- you want us to--

1106
00:42:31.826 --> 00:42:32.243
-No.

1107
00:42:32.243 --> 00:42:32.577
Eat it?

1108
00:42:32.576 --> 00:42:33.160
No.

1109
00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.161
No, no.

1110
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:35.129
I want you to see that
     shit because


1111
00:42:35.129 --> 00:42:35.963
it's part of the story.

1112
00:42:36.547 --> 00:42:37.998
You see that house over there?

1113
00:42:38.416 --> 00:42:40.385
-Yeah.

1114
00:42:40.384 --> 00:42:41.886
-Those assholes always
  let their dog take


1115
00:42:42.386 --> 00:42:43.337
a shit on my lawn.

1116
00:42:43.754 --> 00:42:45.339
The other day I came out here
   to talk to the gardener.


1117
00:42:45.339 --> 00:42:48.676
I stepped in a pile of shit,
wearing a brand new pair of


1118
00:42:48.676 --> 00:42:49.594
suede oxfords.

1119
00:42:49.593 --> 00:42:50.177
I was so fucking pissed.

1120
00:42:50.678 --> 00:42:51.679
They were ruined.

1121
00:42:55.232 --> 00:42:56.734
-OK, so?

1122
00:42:56.734 --> 00:42:59.937
-So I want revenge
on the neighbors.


1123
00:42:59.937 --> 00:43:04.358
$800 to whoever can sit
  inside their house.


1124
00:43:04.692 --> 00:43:06.861
Photographic evidence
      required.


1125
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:07.862
-That's crazy.

1126
00:43:07.862 --> 00:43:09.113
-All right, $1,200.

1127
00:43:09.113 --> 00:43:10.998
That's my final offer.

1128
00:43:10.998 --> 00:43:12.833
-Sure.

1129
00:43:13.334 --> 00:43:14.836
-I'm in.

1130
00:43:14.835 --> 00:43:16.503
-I like it.

1131
00:43:16.504 --> 00:43:17.588
Misfit.

1132
00:43:28.099 --> 00:43:29.851
-Craig, you-- you--

1133
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.302
you really don't want
 to do this, do you?


1134
00:43:32.303 --> 00:43:34.305
-No, I don't want to take a shit
    in this person's house,


1135
00:43:34.305 --> 00:43:35.273
but I need the money.

1136
00:43:35.272 --> 00:43:36.807
My family needs the money.

1137
00:43:36.807 --> 00:43:38.809
-You know, this-- this-- this
  is breaking and entering.


1138
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:41.312
That's minimum two-year
sentence, just so you know.


1139
00:43:41.312 --> 00:43:42.814
-Hey, dummy.

1140
00:43:42.813 --> 00:43:44.815
We just held them at knifepoint,
        and this feels a


1141
00:43:45.282 --> 00:43:46.283
million times safer.

1142
00:43:46.283 --> 00:43:48.819
You're not backing
  out, are you?


1143
00:43:48.819 --> 00:43:49.320
-No.

1144
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.321
No, no.

1145
00:43:50.321 --> 00:43:52.323
I'm not backing out.

1146
00:43:52.323 --> 00:43:54.325
Thanks to you and your shitty
back up and the fact that you


1147
00:43:54.325 --> 00:43:57.328
never searched Violet, this
 stupid fucking game is the


1148
00:43:57.328 --> 00:43:58.329
only way I'm getting
 out of this house


1149
00:43:58.329 --> 00:43:59.330
with any real money.

1150
00:43:59.797 --> 00:44:00.748
So no, I'm not backing out.

1151
00:44:01.248 --> 00:44:02.249
-Just hold the girl.

1152
00:44:02.666 --> 00:44:04.251
I'll take care of the rest.

1153
00:44:04.251 --> 00:44:06.253
I remember that being your
 sole instruction to me.


1154
00:44:06.253 --> 00:44:08.172
-I've been arrested
    before, OK?


1155
00:44:08.672 --> 00:44:10.174
I've been through the system.

1156
00:44:10.174 --> 00:44:11.175
I know I can handle it.

1157
00:44:11.675 --> 00:44:12.676
You, on the other hand?

1158
00:44:12.676 --> 00:44:14.178
That's all I'm saying.

1159
00:45:34.842 --> 00:45:35.843
-Good luck, man.

1160
00:45:57.615 --> 00:45:59.000
[siren]

1161
00:46:02.336 --> 00:46:03.838
-You son of a--

1162
00:46:11.095 --> 00:46:12.597
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): You
  gotta-- you gotta


1163
00:46:13.097 --> 00:46:14.599
start writing lyrics.

1164
00:46:14.598 --> 00:46:16.100
You really have to.

1165
00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.051
OK, then just start journaling
 and then later turn it into


1166
00:46:18.602 --> 00:46:21.105
something, you know
  what I'm saying?

00:46:25.025 --> 00:46:26.610
Hey, there he is.

1168
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.561
Yo, you got something for me?

1169
00:46:31.115 --> 00:46:33.401
Oh, no.

1170
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.985
Oh no, really?

1171
00:46:34.985 --> 00:46:35.819
Oh my god.

1172
00:46:35.819 --> 00:46:36.870
Look at-- you did it.

1173
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:37.821
I can't-- baby, you
 want to see this?


1174
00:46:37.821 --> 00:46:39.823
-I'm good.

1175
00:46:39.823 --> 00:46:42.042
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  What is that?


1176
00:46:42.493 --> 00:46:43.577
What is that?

1177
00:46:43.577 --> 00:46:45.045
-All right, you know what?

1178
00:46:45.045 --> 00:46:47.664
So Craig, yeah, he took a shit
  in your neighbor's house.


1179
00:46:47.665 --> 00:46:48.633
Big fucking deal.

1180
00:46:49.166 --> 00:46:50.634
This little fucker's still
 gonna crap in your yard.


1181
00:46:50.634 --> 00:46:53.670
How about I take care of
   the actual problem


1182
00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:56.757
permanently, huh?

1183
00:46:56.757 --> 00:46:58.676
How much for that?

1184
00:46:58.676 --> 00:47:00.178
Five, $6,000?

1185
00:47:00.678 --> 00:47:03.764
-Uh, how about, uh, nothing?

1186
00:47:03.764 --> 00:47:06.267
Does that figure suit you OK?

1187
00:47:06.767 --> 00:47:07.851
-What?

1188
00:47:07.851 --> 00:47:09.936

   kill a helpless dog.

00:47:10.354 --> 00:47:11.322
-Yeah, but--

1190
00:47:11.322 --> 00:47:12.857
-What kind of sick birthday
   present would that be?


1191
00:47:13.407 --> 00:47:15.075
It's er birthday, Vince.

1192
00:47:15.075 --> 00:47:16.243
-So I--

1193
00:47:16.827 --> 00:47:18.529
I just did all of that
  for-- for nothing?


1194
00:47:18.529 --> 00:47:19.580
VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): Oh, cutie.

1195
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.083
Oh, you are cute, aren't you?

1196
00:47:24.285 --> 00:47:26.287
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): That was
really not fucking cool, what


1197
00:47:26.287 --> 00:47:27.789
you just did, man.

1198
00:47:27.788 --> 00:47:29.290
You could have really fucked
     me up over there.


1199
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.374
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): You fucking
  punched me in the stomach


1200
00:47:30.374 --> 00:47:31.425
before, man.

1201
00:47:31.925 --> 00:47:32.926
You fucking pissed
 on me out there.


1202
00:47:32.926 --> 00:47:33.927
-That is not the same thing.

1203
00:47:33.927 --> 00:47:34.428
-How is that not
the same thing?


1204
00:47:34.928 --> 00:47:35.846
Think about it.

1205
00:47:35.846 --> 00:47:37.431
-Get your fucking finger
  out of my face, man.


1206
00:47:45.522 --> 00:47:47.024
-Come on, guys.

1207
00:47:47.024 --> 00:47:47.942
Ease up.

1208
00:47:47.941 --> 00:47:50.026
It's supposed to be
   a celebration.


1209
00:47:50.027 --> 00:47:51.478
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): What are
    we doing next, huh?


1210
00:47:51.478 --> 00:47:52.980
-Keeping it moving,
    I like that.


1211
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:53.981
How about--

1212
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:54.949
-Where's my money?

1213
00:47:54.948 --> 00:47:56.900

My bad.

   how this ends.

00:48:11.999 --> 00:48:14.001
Can we just fast forward
   this part, please?


1218
00:48:22.009 --> 00:48:24.512
-As promised.

1219
00:48:25.012 --> 00:48:26.013
-What are we doing next, huh?

1220
00:48:31.018 --> 00:48:32.520
-I got it.

1221
00:48:32.519 --> 00:48:37.524
$300 to whoever can make
me a vodka tonic first.


1222
00:48:38.025 --> 00:48:39.026
Three, two, one, go.

1223
00:48:45.416 --> 00:48:47.919
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): One vodka
tonic coming right up, sir.


1224
00:48:47.918 --> 00:48:50.421
Hey, uh, could you toss me one
   of those limes, brother?


1225
00:48:53.757 --> 00:48:55.092
All right.

1226
00:49:04.268 --> 00:49:05.269
-You OK?

1227
00:49:11.775 --> 00:49:12.776
You're really tense.

1228
00:49:18.532 --> 00:49:20.534
All coiled up.

1229
00:49:20.534 --> 00:49:22.036
So many knots.

1230
00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:28.042
I think you'd feel better
 if you let me fuck you.


1231
00:49:32.496 --> 00:49:33.797
-What?

1232
00:49:33.797 --> 00:49:35.799
What did she just say?

1233
00:49:35.799 --> 00:49:37.250
-Still waiting on that
    drink, Vince.


1234
00:49:41.088 --> 00:49:44.174
-Would you like that, Craig?

1235
00:49:44.675 --> 00:49:46.177
Would you like to fuck me?

1236
00:49:46.677 --> 00:49:48.562
-Are you hearing
this right now?

00:49:48.562 --> 00:49:50.064
-Yeah, I am.

1238
00:49:52.483 --> 00:49:53.434
What's the matter, Craig?

1239
00:49:53.934 --> 00:49:55.686
Why don't you want
 to fuck my wife?


1240
00:50:01.442 --> 00:50:02.443
She's hot, isn't she?

1241
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.328
Don't you want to fuck her?

1242
00:50:04.328 --> 00:50:07.331
-You don't care?

1243
00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:08.782
-Why would I?

1244
00:50:08.782 --> 00:50:10.250
-It's cool.

1245
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.785
We have an open relationship.

1246

-Yeah, that's--

1247
00:50:13.287 --> 00:50:15.372
great, but my wife and I don't.

1248

1250
00:50:17.374 --> 00:50:18.759
I'd fuck you, Violet.

1251

-Please, Craig?

1252
00:50:25.682 --> 00:50:26.716
I really want to.

1253
00:50:26.717 --> 00:50:30.221

      you know, woman.


1254
00:50:30.721 --> 00:50:31.555
I'm flattered, really.

1255
00:50:31.555 --> 00:50:32.473
But I--

1256
00:50:32.473 --> 00:50:33.474
I just can't do that.

1257
00:50:33.474 --> 00:50:34.642
-Come on, Craig.

1258
00:50:34.641 --> 00:50:35.225
It's her birthday.

1259

-Guys, I'm married.

1260
00:50:36.977 --> 00:50:37.978
It's not going to happen.

1261
00:50:37.978 --> 00:50:41.949
-Well, how about if I paid
     you to fuck her?


1262
00:50:41.949 --> 00:50:44.368
Would it be cool then?

1263
00:50:44.952 --> 00:50:45.953
-Paid me?

1264
00:50:45.953 --> 00:50:47.955
-Yeah, how about, uh, $2,000?

1265
00:50:48.455 --> 00:50:50.374
-This is some weird-ass
       shit, man.


1266
00:50:55.996 --> 00:50:56.997
-I can't believe I'm
    saying this.


1267
00:50:57.464 --> 00:50:58.749
Uh--

00:50:58.749 --> 00:51:00.751
how about 4,500?

1269
00:51:01.218 --> 00:51:03.637
How does that number sound?

1270
00:51:03.637 --> 00:51:05.139
When I put the money in the
   wallet for-- for-- for

00:51:05.138 --> 00:51:09.142
punching that dude, I saw
   the eviction notice.

Sorry for reading it,

it was right there.

I mean, cut-- cut--
  cut him a break.

I'll fuck her for free, man.

It's not gonna happen.

She's into married dudes.

     you prove it, man?

Show her.

Get your family off

Pay your rent, Craig.

1317
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:49.779
-What do you mean done?

1318
00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.317
-I'm going home.

1319
00:54:53.316 --> 00:54:54.317
-Good.

1320
00:54:54.317 --> 00:54:55.819
Glad to see you go.

1321
00:55:03.827 --> 00:55:05.329
-Ah, shit.

1322
00:55:14.838 --> 00:55:17.808
-See you in five years,
      huh, buddy?


1323
00:55:17.808 --> 00:55:19.310
Don't forget to write.

1324
00:55:41.698 --> 00:55:43.283
-All right, bitches.

1325
00:55:43.784 --> 00:55:45.286
You ready to make
 some real money?


1326
00:55:45.285 --> 00:55:46.286
-Oh, yeah.

1327
00:55:46.286 --> 00:55:47.287
That's what I'm talking about.

1328
00:55:47.287 --> 00:55:47.704
-Hm, would you like that?

1329
00:55:48.038 --> 00:55:48.622
Craig?

1330
00:55:49.122 --> 00:55:49.623
Where's Craig?

1331
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:50.624
-Oh, no.

1332
00:55:50.624 --> 00:55:52.209
He peaced.

1333
00:55:52.209 --> 00:55:53.711
Yeah.

1334
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:54.794
No, I think cheating on his wife
    really freaked him out.


1335
00:55:58.131 --> 00:55:59.716
Where's she going?

1336
00:56:45.478 --> 00:56:46.512
-He's gone.

1337
00:56:46.513 --> 00:56:48.932
-Well--

1338
00:56:48.932 --> 00:56:51.017
well, what's the problem, huh?

1339
00:56:51.017 --> 00:56:54.103
I mean, I'm still here, right?

1340
00:56:54.104 --> 00:56:55.989
We-- we can keep going,
       can't we?


1341
00:56:55.989 --> 00:56:56.990
-No.

1342
00:56:58.992 --> 00:57:00.443
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Wow.

1343
00:57:00.443 --> 00:57:04.113
I'm feeling a little unloved
     right now, buddy.


1344
00:57:04.414 --> 00:57:05.198
-No, no, no.

1345
00:57:05.198 --> 00:57:06.700
You're boss, bro.

1346
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:10.871
It's just that we-- we-- we
 hate breaking up the crew.


1347
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:12.873
-That guy hasn't been part of
 the crew since fucking high


1348
00:57:12.873 --> 00:57:14.875
school, all right?

1349
00:57:15.375 --> 00:57:18.378
Come on, let's keep
  this going, huh?


1350
00:57:18.378 --> 00:57:20.847
What do you want
 me to do next?


1351
00:57:21.348 --> 00:57:22.349
Huh?

1352
00:57:31.358 --> 00:57:32.359
-Follow me.

1353
00:57:39.866 --> 00:57:41.368
Cut your pinkie off.

1354
00:57:46.373 --> 00:57:47.074
Is that not cool?

1355
00:57:47.073 --> 00:57:48.575
-Fuck you.

1356
00:57:48.575 --> 00:57:52.162
-Do or you don't, it doesn't
       matter to me.


1357
00:57:52.162 --> 00:57:54.631
It's your pinkie.

1358
00:57:54.631 --> 00:57:57.050
You use it for, like, nothing.

1359
00:57:57.634 --> 00:57:59.136
-What's the iron for?

1360
00:57:59.135 --> 00:58:00.553
-To cauterize the wound.

1361
00:58:03.423 --> 00:58:05.008
-How much is this worth?

1362
00:58:05.008 --> 00:58:07.594
-How much?

1363
00:58:07.594 --> 00:58:09.096
Yeah.

1364
00:58:09.596 --> 00:58:11.598
How much, he wants to know.

1365
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:18.772
Let's think about it.

1366
00:58:19.239 --> 00:58:20.273
Let's say--

1367
00:58:25.779 --> 00:58:34.087
$25,000.

1368
00:58:34.087 --> 00:58:37.757
-$25,000?

1369
00:58:37.757 --> 00:58:39.842
To cut off my pinkie?

1370
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:47.851
OK, I'll do it.

1371
00:58:47.851 --> 00:58:48.135
-Really?

1372
00:58:48.435 --> 00:58:49.519
-Yeah.

1373
00:58:53.023 --> 00:58:56.026
-That's cool.

1374
00:58:56.026 --> 00:58:56.443
OK.

1375
00:58:56.443 --> 00:58:57.894
-Yeah, I'll cut off my pinkie.

1376
00:58:57.894 --> 00:58:58.945
-Awesome.

1377
00:58:58.945 --> 00:59:01.448
-For $25,000.

1378
00:59:01.948 --> 00:59:02.949
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): I'll
     do it for 23.


1379
00:59:05.869 --> 00:59:07.871
-Oh, shit.

1380
00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:09.456
What the fuck?

1381
00:59:09.456 --> 00:59:10.490
Are you shitting me?

1382
00:59:13.243 --> 00:59:14.327
Where the fuck have you been?

1383
00:59:14.327 --> 00:59:16.329
What are you, like, a ninja?

1384
00:59:16.329 --> 00:59:20.250
-I'll cut my pinkie
  off for $23,000.


1385
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.052
-What the fuck is wrong
    with you, Craig?


1386
00:59:22.052 --> 00:59:23.136
-You don't get it, do you?

1387
00:59:23.136 --> 00:59:24.638
-No.

1388
00:59:24.637 --> 00:59:25.638
Look, you've already got your
    rent money, all right?


1389
00:59:25.638 --> 00:59:28.641
Let somebody else have a shot.

1390
00:59:28.641 --> 00:59:31.644
-That 4,500 takes care of my
eviction problems, but only


1391
00:59:31.644 --> 00:59:32.145
this month.

1392
00:59:32.645 --> 00:59:33.646
What about next month?

1393
00:59:33.646 --> 00:59:35.348
My wife and I are
 both unemployed.


1394
00:59:35.348 --> 00:59:36.349
How do I pay my rent?

1395
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:37.650
How do I feed my kid?

1396
00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:40.436
23 grand gives me some--
  some breathing room.


1397
00:59:40.937 --> 00:59:43.940
So if I gotta cut my pinkie
       off for that,


1398
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.942
fuck it, I'll do it.

1399
00:59:45.942 --> 00:59:47.444
-That's right, Craig.

1400
00:59:47.944 --> 00:59:48.945
You gotta think about
     the future.


1401
00:59:49.446 --> 00:59:49.863
-Yeah.

1402
00:59:49.863 --> 00:59:50.747
No, no.

1403
00:59:50.747 --> 00:59:52.699
But wait, wait-- what
    about me, huh?


1404
00:59:52.699 --> 00:59:55.202
Every time I go to work,
    I'm this close--


1405
00:59:55.752 --> 00:59:57.754
this fucking close to be
  thrown back in jail.


1406
00:59:58.038 --> 00:59:58.789
And I don't make that
     much money.


1407
00:59:59.372 --> 01:00:01.374
Not for what I fucking do.

1408
01:00:01.374 --> 01:00:03.459
-Nobody told you to drop
  out of high school.


1409
01:00:03.793 --> 01:00:06.129
You could have done anything
 you wanted, but you didn't


1410
01:00:06.129 --> 01:00:07.130
want to work for it.

1411
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.633
Your life is exactly
 what you made it.


1412
01:00:12.268 --> 01:00:13.770
-Wow.

1413
01:00:15.772 --> 01:00:16.606
Fuck you.

1414
01:00:22.612 --> 01:00:26.149
I'll do it for 22.

1415
01:00:26.449 --> 01:00:27.533
-21.

1416
01:00:31.571 --> 01:00:33.073
-20.

1417
01:00:33.073 --> 01:00:37.210
And if you say another fucking
 word, I will knock you out.


1418
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.211
-19.

1419
01:00:38.711 --> 01:00:42.164
-I said shut your
  fucking mouth.


1420
01:00:42.165 --> 01:00:43.667
18.

1421
01:00:53.393 --> 01:00:53.810
-All right.

1422
01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:56.596
-$15,000.

1423
01:00:56.596 --> 01:00:59.516
-Are you fucking crazy, man?

1424
01:00:59.516 --> 01:01:02.019
You're gonna cut off your
   pinkie for $15,000?


1425
01:01:02.018 --> 01:01:03.520
That's a finger.

1426
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.771
-It's not like it's
   gone forever.


1427
01:01:05.271 --> 01:01:09.275
Even if costs me six grand to
 sew it back on, that's still


1428
01:01:09.275 --> 01:01:10.743
9,000 more dollars than when
  I woke up this morning.


1429
01:01:11.277 --> 01:01:11.778
-All right.

1430
01:01:11.778 --> 01:01:12.696
Fine, man.

1431
01:01:12.695 --> 01:01:14.280
If you want to mutilate
      yourself for


1432
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.283
$15,000, go right ahead.

1433
01:01:17.283 --> 01:01:18.785
-All right.

1434
01:01:18.785 --> 01:01:20.287
Let's, uh--

1435
01:01:20.787 --> 01:01:23.256
let's get it ready.

1436
01:01:23.256 --> 01:01:24.290
Uh, OK.

1437
01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:25.291
This one, right?

1438
01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:26.292
-Oh, wait.

1439
01:01:26.292 --> 01:01:27.293
Could we do-- because
     I use that--


1440
01:01:27.293 --> 01:01:27.794
-Sure.

1441
01:01:27.794 --> 01:01:28.295
Yeah.

1442
01:01:28.294 --> 01:01:29.295
Your choice.

1443
01:01:29.295 --> 01:01:29.796
-Thank you.

1444
01:01:30.296 --> 01:01:30.797
That's nice of you.

1445
01:01:30.797 --> 01:01:31.298
-There you go.

1446
01:01:31.798 --> 01:01:32.299
Care to do the honors?

1447
01:01:32.298 --> 01:01:33.299
-It would be my pleasure.

1448
01:01:33.299 --> 01:01:34.300
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1449
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.301
You--

1450
01:01:35.301 --> 01:01:36.302
you don't want to
  do it, Colin?


1451
01:01:36.302 --> 01:01:37.136
-Sorry, dude.

1452
01:01:37.137 --> 01:01:38.689
Too gross.

1453
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.942
-Let's put that right there.

1454
01:01:41.941 --> 01:01:42.942
OK?

1455
01:01:42.942 --> 01:01:43.943
I'm going to count to three.

1456
01:01:44.444 --> 01:01:44.945
One--

1457
01:01:44.944 --> 01:01:45.945
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1458
01:01:45.945 --> 01:01:46.446
Jesus Christ.

1459
01:01:46.446 --> 01:01:46.947
Hold on.

1460
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:51.368
OK, I'm ready.

1461
01:01:51.367 --> 01:01:52.285
Are you ready?

1462
01:01:52.285 --> 01:01:52.819
-One.

1463
01:01:52.819 --> 01:01:53.820
-No, no, no.

1464
01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:54.787
Not yet.

1465
01:01:54.787 --> 01:01:55.821
Just are you ready?

1466
01:01:55.822 --> 01:01:58.158
-Yes, I'm ready.

1467
01:01:58.158 --> 01:02:00.744
Are you ready?

1468
01:02:00.743 --> 01:02:02.712
-Are you sure you don't want
 to do this instead of him?


1469
01:02:03.246 --> 01:02:05.248
-Sorry, bro.

1470
01:02:05.248 --> 01:02:06.249
-OK.

1471
01:02:06.249 --> 01:02:09.753
OK, OK, OK.

1472
01:02:09.752 --> 01:02:10.253
Go.

1473
01:02:10.753 --> 01:02:11.254
-One--

1474
01:02:11.254 --> 01:02:11.671
-Wait.

1475
01:02:11.671 --> 01:02:12.755
-What?

1476
01:02:12.755 --> 01:02:15.258
-I gotta check to make
 sure the iron's hot.


1477
01:02:15.258 --> 01:02:15.759
OK.

1478
01:02:16.259 --> 01:02:16.726
I--

1479
01:02:16.726 --> 01:02:17.677
I don't want blood everywhere.

1480
01:02:17.677 --> 01:02:18.678
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN):
  Jesus Christ.


1481
01:02:19.262 --> 01:02:19.763
-We're good to go.

1482
01:02:19.762 --> 01:02:20.763
-OK.

1483
01:02:20.763 --> 01:02:23.266
For real this time, all right?

1484
01:02:23.266 --> 01:02:25.235
-Oh yeah.

1485
01:02:25.235 --> 01:02:27.187
-Do it, Vince.

1486
01:02:27.187 --> 01:02:28.321
-One, two, three.

1487
01:02:28.321 --> 01:02:29.272
-Oh shit, bro.

1488
01:02:29.606 --> 01:02:31.992
You can't puss out on us now.

1489
01:02:31.991 --> 01:02:33.359
-I need something
  for the pain.


1490
01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:34.193
-What are you talking about?

1491
01:02:34.194 --> 01:02:34.778
He hasn't even done it yet.

1492
01:02:35.278 --> 01:02:36.196
-No, no.

1493
01:02:36.196 --> 01:02:37.864
Something to take away the pain,
     to numb it, to keep me


1494
01:02:37.864 --> 01:02:39.366
from feeling anything
 in the first place.


1495
01:02:39.365 --> 01:02:40.616
-Oh, uh--

1496
01:02:40.617 --> 01:02:42.002
you still got those
 pills I gave you?


1497
01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:43.119
-Yeah, one of them.

1498
01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:44.087
Somewhere.

1499
01:02:44.087 --> 01:02:45.255
-Well, give it to me.

1500
01:02:45.255 --> 01:02:46.206
I'll crush it up.

1501
01:02:46.206 --> 01:02:47.207
You can rail it.

1502
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.124
You won't feel a
 fucking thing.


1503
01:02:48.124 --> 01:02:49.125
-It's in here somewhere.

1504
01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:51.794
Hold on.

1505
01:02:52.295 --> 01:02:53.296
-There it is.

1506
01:02:53.596 --> 01:02:54.347
It's done.

1507
01:02:54.347 --> 01:02:56.349
And I hope it hurt.

1508
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:58.184
-Oh, shit.

1509
01:02:58.184 --> 01:02:59.135
Fuck.

1510
01:02:59.135 --> 01:03:00.136
You OK, Craig?

1511
01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:09.813
[screaming]

1512
01:03:21.407 --> 01:03:21.908
-Let go.

1513
01:03:22.408 --> 01:03:23.376
Just let go of your arm.

1514
01:03:23.376 --> 01:03:23.743
-Here.

1515
01:03:23.743 --> 01:03:24.827
Fucking here.

1516
01:03:24.827 --> 01:03:25.328
-Come on, there we go.

1517
01:03:25.828 --> 01:03:27.296
Go, go, go, go, go.

1518
01:03:27.297 --> 01:03:27.798
Get it.

1519
01:03:28.298 --> 01:03:29.299
Get it.

1520
01:03:29.299 --> 01:03:29.800
Get it.

1521
01:03:29.799 --> 01:03:30.717
-Fuck.

1522
01:03:30.717 --> 01:03:31.801
-What are you waiting for?

1523
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:33.886
-It's still fucking attached.

1524
01:03:33.886 --> 01:03:34.804
All the way off.

1525
01:03:34.804 --> 01:03:36.723
That's the fucking deal, bro.

1526
01:03:36.723 --> 01:03:38.808
-Are you fucking kidding me?

1527
01:03:38.808 --> 01:03:40.310
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  Get the knife.


1528
01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:41.978
-Fuck that.

1529
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.981
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, fuck.

1530
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:46.482
[screaming]

1531
01:03:50.987 --> 01:03:52.405
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Fuck
  yeah, motherfucker.


1532
01:03:54.857 --> 01:03:56.325
Yeah, motherfucker.

1533
01:03:56.776 --> 01:04:00.280
Yeah, motherfucker.

1534
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.449
Fuck yeah, motherfucker.

1535
01:04:07.337 --> 01:04:08.839
[crying]

1536
01:04:22.685 --> 01:04:23.553
-Fuck, dude.

1537
01:04:24.053 --> 01:04:25.555
You fucking did it.

1538
01:04:26.022 --> 01:04:28.892
How's it feel to be
  $15,000 richer?


1539
01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:32.228
-Do me a favor.

1540
01:04:32.228 --> 01:04:35.231
Let me see it.

1541
01:04:35.732 --> 01:04:38.235
I want to see the money.

1542
01:04:38.234 --> 01:04:39.736
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Fuck,
  that's not a favor.


1543
01:04:39.736 --> 01:04:41.204
You earned it, man.

1544
01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:47.794
Fuck yes.

1545
01:04:47.794 --> 01:04:48.378
Here.

1546
01:04:48.378 --> 01:04:49.329
Fuck yeah.

1547
01:04:49.329 --> 01:04:50.881
Fuck yeah.

1548
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.334
Five, 10, $15,000,
  motherfucker.


1549
01:04:55.335 --> 01:04:56.837
Shit.

1550
01:04:56.836 --> 01:04:59.339
That's fucking great.

1551
01:04:59.339 --> 01:05:01.341
Right on, bro.

1552
01:05:01.341 --> 01:05:02.809
Yeah.

1553
01:05:16.856 --> 01:05:18.574
What's that sound?

1554
01:05:18.574 --> 01:05:20.609
[gagging]

1555
01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:23.113
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): There
     it was again.


1556
01:05:23.112 --> 01:05:25.031
[gagging]

1557
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:26.616
-Oh, I think I just heard it.

1558
01:05:26.616 --> 01:05:28.084
-Good.

1559
01:05:28.084 --> 01:05:30.036
I thought I was going
    fucking crazy.


1560
01:05:30.036 --> 01:05:32.005
-No, I heard it that time.

1561
01:05:32.004 --> 01:05:33.956
VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): I think it's
     coming from over here.


1562
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:47.687
-Guys, do you know where
     my finger is?


1563
01:05:47.687 --> 01:05:48.688
VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): Uh-oh.

1564
01:05:48.688 --> 01:05:49.889
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  What's wrong?


1565
01:05:49.889 --> 01:05:52.225
-Oh, the dog's dead.

1566
01:05:52.225 --> 01:05:53.359
-What the fuck?

1567
01:05:53.359 --> 01:05:54.443
What--

1568
01:05:54.444 --> 01:05:55.946
how'd that happen?

1569
01:05:59.449 --> 01:06:01.952
Oh, no.

1570
01:06:02.452 --> 01:06:02.953
What the fuck?

1571
01:06:03.369 --> 01:06:05.955
-Oh, it choked on
 Craig's finger.


1572
01:06:12.879 --> 01:06:14.381
-All right, I'll take
    care of this.


1573
01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:15.631
Go check on him.

1574
01:06:22.588 --> 01:06:24.090
-Fuck.

1575
01:06:27.894 --> 01:06:29.396
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): That's
      fucking weird.


1576
01:06:39.856 --> 01:06:44.744
-Good luck reattaching that
     crew toy now, huh?


1577
01:06:44.744 --> 01:06:48.197
-You're a real piece of
  shit, you know that?


1578
01:06:52.418 --> 01:06:53.502
-Yeah.

1579
01:06:55.004 --> 01:06:58.875
At least I didn't steal $25,000
        from my friend.


1580
01:06:58.875 --> 01:07:02.212
-I need that money
  for my family.


1581
01:07:05.214 --> 01:07:08.801
You'd just blow it on
  hookers and drugs.


1582
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:10.386
I know you.

1583
01:07:10.386 --> 01:07:11.888
-Yeah, I know you too, Craig.

1584
01:07:11.888 --> 01:07:15.692
-I'm not that person anymore.

1585
01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:17.776
I have responsibilities.

1586
01:07:17.777 --> 01:07:19.279
I have a life to live.

1587
01:07:19.278 --> 01:07:24.283
You don't have shit to do but
  waste the world's oxygen.


1588
01:07:24.283 --> 01:07:26.285
You're a fucking loser.

1589
01:07:26.786 --> 01:07:30.406
You know that, Vince?

1590
01:07:30.406 --> 01:07:30.790
-No.

1591
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.875
Yeah, I do.

1592
01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:34.377
I know I'm a loser.

1593
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.883
See, I've always known that.

1594
01:07:39.882 --> 01:07:43.219
But you, you really surprised
          me, Craig.


1595
01:07:43.219 --> 01:07:46.222
You see, because you had
parents that loved you.


1596
01:07:46.222 --> 01:07:49.058
And they took care of you.

1597
01:07:49.058 --> 01:07:54.063
They sent you to college and
   got you an education.


1598
01:07:54.063 --> 01:07:56.849
But look how you fucking
      turned out.


1599
01:07:56.849 --> 01:07:58.851
I mean, you obviously didn't
    make it as a writer.


1600
01:07:58.851 --> 01:08:01.737
I mean, hell, you can't even
keep a job changing oil at a


1601
01:08:02.238 --> 01:08:03.239
fucking car shop.

1602
01:08:05.241 --> 01:08:10.246
You had to fuck another woman
and mutilate yourself just to


1603
01:08:10.246 --> 01:08:11.748
keep your family
off the street.


1604
01:08:11.747 --> 01:08:12.748
So who's--

1605
01:08:12.748 --> 01:08:15.251
who's the bigger loser?

1606
01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:16.753
Huh?

1607
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:26.462
-Oh, you guys are still here.

1608
01:08:26.462 --> 01:08:28.014
-Fuck, that smells good.

1609
01:08:28.014 --> 01:08:28.515
-Doesn't it?

1610
01:08:29.015 --> 01:08:29.516
-Yeah.

1611
01:08:29.515 --> 01:08:30.016
-You hungry?

1612
01:08:30.516 --> 01:08:31.017
-I could eat.

1613
01:08:31.017 --> 01:08:32.519
-Then let's do it.

1614
01:08:32.518 --> 01:08:33.969
Join me.

1615
01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:36.139
Let's gain sustenance,
      shall we?


1616
01:08:38.641 --> 01:08:41.727
You know what, honey, that
bottle we've been saving.


1617
01:08:45.948 --> 01:08:47.950
Ah--

1618
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:51.570
this particular dish
 pairs well with a


1619
01:08:51.571 --> 01:08:55.575
$10,000 bottle of tequila.

1620
01:08:55.575 --> 01:08:58.078
Asuckamadee, Pancho Villa.

1621
01:09:00.713 --> 01:09:04.250
-What the fuck?

1622
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.752
What?

1623
01:09:08.254 --> 01:09:09.722
-Oh, no.

1624
01:09:09.722 --> 01:09:10.723
Oh, no.

1625
01:09:11.223 --> 01:09:14.059
-Moments ago you were raving
      about the smell.


1626
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.511
-Why-- why did you--

1627
01:09:15.895 --> 01:09:16.929
-Make it?

1628
01:09:16.929 --> 01:09:18.481
So you could eat
 it, obviously.


1629
01:09:18.481 --> 01:09:21.484
-Yeah, but I thought you
 guys were dog people.


1630
01:09:21.484 --> 01:09:22.485
-No, no.

1631
01:09:22.485 --> 01:09:24.103
I just don't want to kill
    a helpless animal.


1632
01:09:24.103 --> 01:09:26.155
But I mean, it's already
       dead, so--


1633
01:09:26.155 --> 01:09:27.273
you're not vegetarians,
        are you?


1634
01:09:27.823 --> 01:09:28.357
-Oh my god.

1635
01:09:28.858 --> 01:09:29.859
I think I just became one.

1636
01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:32.362
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Tastes
  like chicken, really.


1637
01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:33.362
-But it's not a chicken.

1638
01:09:33.362 --> 01:09:34.363
It's a dog.

1639
01:09:34.864 --> 01:09:35.948
-Don't be so limited, bro.

1640
01:09:36.532 --> 01:09:38.534
I've seen dog on menus
throughout the world.


1641
01:09:38.534 --> 01:09:39.752
You need to get out.

1642
01:09:39.752 --> 01:09:41.837
-Is it even safe to eat?

1643
01:09:41.837 --> 01:09:43.339
-Yes.

1644
01:09:43.339 --> 01:09:45.758
Cooked all the way through,
internal temperature of 165.


1645
01:09:45.758 --> 01:09:48.294
I've got a meat thermometer.

1646
01:09:48.294 --> 01:09:51.380
So what's the offer?

1647
01:09:53.382 --> 01:10:01.690
$50,000 to whoever finishes
    their portion first.


1648
01:10:01.691 --> 01:10:03.610
$50,000.

1649
01:10:03.609 --> 01:10:07.146
That's probably more than you
 guys make in a year, right?


1650
01:10:07.647 --> 01:10:08.481
Think about that.

1651
01:10:09.065 --> 01:10:10.567
Takes away a lot of worry.

1652
01:10:11.033 --> 01:10:12.151
Bills are paid.

1653
01:10:12.735 --> 01:10:15.288
You have time to do
 things you wanted.


1654
01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.881
It's a mental game, guys.

1655
01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:26.882
It's easy to get past.

1656
01:10:30.753 --> 01:10:31.053
-All right, fuck it.

1657
01:10:31.637 --> 01:10:34.006
Yeah, I'm in.

1658
01:10:34.006 --> 01:10:36.141
-Here's your--

1659
01:10:36.142 --> 01:10:36.726
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): I'm in.

1660
01:10:36.726 --> 01:10:37.727
I'm in.

1661
01:10:38.227 --> 01:10:38.728
I'm in.

1662
01:10:38.728 --> 01:10:40.647
-Nice.

1663
01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:41.681
Hold on.

1664
01:10:41.681 --> 01:10:42.649
I don't trust him.

1665
01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:52.024
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): First
  to finish, 50 grand.


1666
01:10:55.027 --> 01:10:57.029
What's going on, guys?

1667
01:10:57.029 --> 01:10:58.781
What are you waiting for?

1668
01:11:05.171 --> 01:11:06.172
Let's eat.

1669
01:11:47.163 --> 01:11:47.797
-Oh, I'm done.

1670
01:11:47.797 --> 01:11:48.998
-Done.

1671
01:11:51.751 --> 01:11:53.753
-Shit, that was close.

1672
01:11:53.753 --> 01:11:54.254
Violet?

1673
01:11:54.253 --> 01:11:54.920
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): No.

1674
01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.921
No, no, no.

1675
01:11:55.921 --> 01:11:56.472
Clearly I won.

1676
01:11:56.472 --> 01:11:57.640
Look.

1677
01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.724
Open your mouth.

1678
01:11:58.724 --> 01:11:59.141
Open your mouth.

1679
01:11:59.141 --> 01:12:00.092
-It's open.

1680
01:12:00.092 --> 01:12:01.093
Ahh.

1681
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:05.732
-Fuck.

1682
01:12:05.731 --> 01:12:10.352
Guys, that was a tie.

1683
01:12:10.352 --> 01:12:12.771
-What?

1684
01:12:12.772 --> 01:12:15.191
-Uh, we need a tiebreaker.

1685
01:12:21.113 --> 01:12:22.331
Great idea.

1686
01:12:25.918 --> 01:12:34.343
I guess whoever eats Craig's
   finger gets the money.


1687
01:12:39.298 --> 01:12:39.799
-No.

1688
01:12:39.799 --> 01:12:40.800
No, no.

1689
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.135
[screaming]

1690
01:12:52.611 --> 01:12:54.113
-Crying like a motherfucker?

1691
01:12:54.613 --> 01:12:56.115
[grunting]

1692
01:13:30.266 --> 01:13:32.902
-That still counts, right?

1693
01:13:32.902 --> 01:13:34.987
-It counts, Craig.

1694
01:13:34.987 --> 01:13:37.072
You're the winner.

1695
01:13:37.573 --> 01:13:40.576
-(CHUCKLING) I did it.

1696
01:13:43.078 --> 01:13:47.082
50,000 fucking dollars.

1697
01:13:47.082 --> 01:13:49.001
[laughing]

1698
01:14:03.432 --> 01:14:06.936
-You're fucking weak, Craig.

1699
01:14:06.936 --> 01:14:08.354
You always were.

1700
01:14:14.894 --> 01:14:17.897
-Let's get you some air.

1701
01:14:17.897 --> 01:14:19.399
There we go.

1702
01:14:46.008 --> 01:14:47.593
-Oh, fuck.

1703
01:14:47.593 --> 01:14:50.563
You know what, fuck him, man.

1704
01:14:50.562 --> 01:14:55.600
You know, he used to get his
 ass beat, his fucking ass


1705
01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:58.104
handed to him, all the time.

1706
01:14:58.103 --> 01:14:59.605
And who would he
come crying to?


1707
01:15:00.155 --> 01:15:01.657
To me.

1708
01:15:01.657 --> 01:15:03.659
To me, and I would always
      have his back.


1709
01:15:03.659 --> 01:15:07.112
I always had your back.

1710
01:15:07.112 --> 01:15:11.166
And how does he fucking
     repay me, huh?


1711
01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:13.118
By thinking he's fucking
    better than me.


1712
01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:18.174
You know, he thinks he fucking
     deserves that money.


1713
01:15:18.173 --> 01:15:20.175
He doesn't deserve shit--

1714
01:15:20.175 --> 01:15:22.177
not a fucking dime.

1715
01:15:27.683 --> 01:15:30.186
Fuck, man.

1716
01:15:30.185 --> 01:15:31.687
I almost fucking killed him.

1717
01:15:35.274 --> 01:15:36.776
-Why don't you do it?

1718
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:41.313
[chuckling]

1719
01:15:45.818 --> 01:15:49.322
-Do it.

1720
01:15:49.321 --> 01:15:52.574
$250,000.

1721
01:15:52.574 --> 01:15:56.578
I'll take care of
 the rest of it.


1722
01:15:56.578 --> 01:16:00.082
This is your chance, Vince.

1723
01:16:00.082 --> 01:16:03.052
Fresh start.

1724
01:16:03.052 --> 01:16:04.503
Living the life you want.

1725
01:16:17.316 --> 01:16:27.316
-$250,000?

1726
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:34.666
-You want to play us
 a slideshow, baby?


1727
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.503
She did this one for our
wedding, it's fucking killer.


1728
01:16:42.508 --> 01:16:45.428
Craig, you want a
  beer or, like,


1729
01:16:45.427 --> 01:16:47.879
an ice pack of something?

1730
01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.633
-Uh, cab.

1731
01:16:50.632 --> 01:16:51.633
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Fuck,
     you know what?


1732
01:16:51.633 --> 01:16:52.134
You're right.

1733
01:16:52.634 --> 01:16:53.802
It's fucking late.

1734
01:16:53.802 --> 01:16:56.855
Slash early.

1735
01:16:56.855 --> 01:16:59.808
You know, I'm feeling
    kinda brunchy.


1736
01:16:59.808 --> 01:17:00.809
You guys into that?

1737
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:05.230
-Yeah.

1738
01:17:05.731 --> 01:17:06.732
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): I could
 pound, like, 100 Bloody


1739
01:17:06.732 --> 01:17:08.200
Mary's right now.

1740
01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.371
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): Hey Colin,
  can you call a cab for me?


1741
01:17:12.371 --> 01:17:13.372
-Sure, man.

1742
01:17:13.872 --> 01:17:16.208
But I'm paying for it.

1743
01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:19.711
Because I'm a good host.

1744
01:17:19.711 --> 01:17:21.213
I got some guy--

1745
01:17:21.213 --> 01:17:22.715
here we go.

1746
01:17:26.668 --> 01:17:27.169
Oh, there we go.

1747
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:28.887
Ha, ha.

1748
01:17:31.924 --> 01:17:34.176
The reunion shot.

1749
01:17:34.176 --> 01:17:35.761
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): Colin.

1750
01:17:35.761 --> 01:17:36.262
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

1751
01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:37.763
OK, OK, OK.

1752
01:17:45.687 --> 01:17:47.189
Hi, is this Central Cab?

1753
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:50.192
Yeah, to pick up.

1754
01:17:50.192 --> 01:17:53.495
The address is 1231 Waverly.

1755
01:17:53.495 --> 01:17:54.329
Oh, Craig.

1756
01:17:54.329 --> 01:17:57.199
Go ahead and get your 50,000.

1757
01:17:57.199 --> 01:17:58.500
I trust you.

1758
01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.085
Count it out.

1759
01:18:00.536 --> 01:18:02.705
No, I was talking to a friend.

1760
01:18:02.704 --> 01:18:12.704
All right, 20 minutes
   Oh shit, Vince.


1761
01:18:15.267 --> 01:18:16.685
This shit was so funny.

1762
01:19:22.084 --> 01:19:25.170
-Craig, let's get the
  fuck out of here.


1763
01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:27.122
[gunshot]

1764
01:19:54.399 --> 01:19:55.867
[gunshot]

1765
01:20:15.254 --> 01:20:16.589
-Whoa, that was grim.

1766
01:20:20.425 --> 01:20:21.893
That was grim.

1767
01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:54.460
Hey.

1768
01:20:54.459 --> 01:20:56.962
You know that--

1769
01:20:56.962 --> 01:20:57.846
that maid service
 we talked about?


1770
01:21:02.934 --> 01:21:04.185
Yeah, I need that now.

1771
01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:37.419
It's been good partying
    with you, Craig.


1772
01:22:03.662 --> 01:22:05.113
Good call on your boy.

1773
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.203
I thought my guy was
 gonna wrap it up.


1774
01:22:11.703 --> 01:22:12.704
[sigh]

1775
01:23:37.789 --> 01:23:40.008
[baby crying]

1776
01:23:47.516 --> 01:23:51.387
-Oh, it's OK.

01:23:51.636 --> 01:23:53.221
[crying]
