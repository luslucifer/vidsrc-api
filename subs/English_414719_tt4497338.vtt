00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.435
- [helicopter whirring]
- [woman] Oh, my God!


2
00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:41.691
[man] Ma'am?
Ma'am, can you give me your location?


3
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.568
[many news reporters talking]
Clearly, people here want some answers.


4
00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:46.867
- Breaking news...
- We have confirmed...


5
00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.445
- And the robbery happened around...
- At this time, information...


6
00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:51.656
...don't go near this area.

7
00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:53.991
...into the buildings here behind us...

8
00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:55.826
The question on everyone's mind

9
00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.412
is how did this situation
get out of control here?


10
00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:02.545
...so the pictures you're seeing,
this is a major incident.


11
00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:04.046
...police have a suspect in custody.

12
00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.254
[man]
What drives a person to commit a crime?


13
00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:09.681
To destroy?
To weaken someone's resolve?


14
00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:13.135
Vengeance? Spite?

15
00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:14.470
Religion?

16
00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:16.681
- Money?
- [siren wailing]


17
00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:19.141
Communities, cities, entire countries

18
00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:22.319
are put beneath microscopes
and analyzed for their flaws,


19
00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:25.614
their weaknesses,
so that one individual


20
00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.613
can find the smallest chink
in the system's armor


21
00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:31.195
- and benefit from it.
- [reporters overlapping]


22
00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:37.289
[female reporter] Clearly, this has been
done by an explosives expert.


23
00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.586
- [male reporter] Police say...
- [man] My name is Lucas Nolan.


24
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.414
I'm an interrogation specialist.

25
00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:44.625
I elicit useful information
from a suspect,


26
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:50.636
build a rapport, and utilize
any techniques necessary to gather data.


27
00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:52.842
At least,
that's what the book says.


28
00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:54.392
I'm good at it.

29
00:01:55.677 --> 00:01:58.055
No, I'm great at it...

30
00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:00.561
Peeling away every layer
of a person's mind


31
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.939
and uncovering a clue
at the root of a problem.


32
00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:04.019
[gun fires]

33
00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:06.104
And if you know
what you're looking for...


34
00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:11.448
...you can prevent it
all from ever happening.


35
00:02:11.693 --> 00:02:15.698
[gunfire]

36
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:19.081
[man] Shots fired! Shots fired!
Code 236, we're under fire!


37
00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.550
[man]
Shots fired! Shots fired!


38
00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.223
Officer pinned down, taking heavy fire!
Need backup!


39
00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:36.893
[woman] All units, all units, please
respond. Officers need assistance.


40
00:02:36.968 --> 00:02:41.348
Shots fired. Go to this location:

41
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:44.059
AH units, officers need assistance.
Shots fired.


42
00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:47.772
[grunts]

43
00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:49.948
Where the hell is that backup?!

44
00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:55.287
Who the hell are you?

45
00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:58.206
Nolan, FBI. What do we got?

46
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.955
Suspect robbed the Bank of America.
Tracked his car here.


47
00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:11.677
[grunts]

48
00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:22.056
Four seconds a clip.
Probably an M4 automatic.


49
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.978
Five seconds to reload.

50
00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:39.407
Hope he's consistent.

51
00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.242
Hey, where are you going?

52
00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:46.580
One, two, three, four...

53
00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:55.384
[yells]

54
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.520
- What the hell is he doing?!
- I have no idea.


55
00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:14.032
One, two, three, four.

56
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.163
Four seconds. You're out.

57
00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:22.240
- [gun clicks]
- Shit.


58
00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:23.826
[yells]

59
00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:27.462
[grunts]

60
00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:38.515
[grunts]

61
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.092
How'd you know he was out?

62
00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:41.893
Lucky guess.

63
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:45.639
[grunting]

64
00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:54.101
Can I help you?

65
00:06:54.184 --> 00:06:56.903
Are you in charge of bomb threats?

66
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:00.615
- Excuse me?
- You know,


67
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.489
this bomb is going to go off
at this place, at this time.


68
00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:05.787
You should be really scared
type of thing.


69
00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:11.205
When exactly is this bomb gonna go off?

70
00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:17.458
Now.

71
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.548
[explosion]

72
00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:22.345
[people screaming]

73
00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:27.968
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands now!


74
00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:29.223
Son of a bitch.

75
00:07:29.302 --> 00:07:32.146
On the ground.
On your knees now!


76
00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:47.450
[siren wailing]

77
00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:49.497
[man] All right, go through.

78
00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:53.293
- Next. ID?
- Good to go.


79
00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:56.622
- How bad is it?
- No casualties, but bad enough.


80
00:07:56.705 --> 00:07:58.582
Sixty square blocks with no electricity.

81
00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:01.088
It'll take at least 12 hours
to get it back online.


82
00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:03.169
Good news, we still got power.

83
00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:05.506
That's not good news.
We could have the day off.


84
00:08:05.588 --> 00:08:07.056
Yeah, I heard that.

85
00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:12.388
Next. All right, go through.

86
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.188
- [siren wailing]
- Next.


87
00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:15.686
- [elevator dings]
- [chatter]


88
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:35.793
We should get this started.

89
00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:39.965
A man who gives himself up like that
knows he's about to be interrogated.


90
00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:44.962
- Who's our guy?
- He's a memory savant.


91
00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:46.672
He remembers anything and everything.

92
00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:49.349
And he plays back
highlights in his mind better than ESPN.


93
00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:51.552
He's a walking, talking encyclopedia.

94
00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:54.057
Never pretends he has
more knowledge than the suspect


95
00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:55.764
to gain the upper hand
because he does.


96
00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:58.191
How is that possible?

97
00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:01.065
- [door opens]
- What'd I miss?


98
00:09:01.144 --> 00:09:02.737
Nice of you to join us.

99
00:09:02.812 --> 00:09:04.655
Luke, you know Special Agent Sara Ward.

100
00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:06.574
Anti-terror, right?

101
00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:11.784
So what do we got on this guy?

102
00:09:11.863 --> 00:09:13.160
[man] Not much.

103
00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:15.412
- Prints?
- Nope.


104
00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:18.166
- He filed them off.
- Or burned them.


105
00:09:18.244 --> 00:09:20.667
We're running his face through
the Bureau databases right now,


106
00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:22.920
- but so far...
- I get it.


107
00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:35.349
We got one wallet, empty.
Some kind of paint smudge on it


108
00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:37.931
and a key with the letters
"MS" scratched onto it.


109
00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:39.436
[sighs]

110
00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:42.315
- How much time I got?
- You don't.


111
00:09:43.853 --> 00:09:45.571
You think there's
another bomb out there?


112
00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:55.373
You two better be right about him.

113
00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:11.632
[sighs]

114
00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:30.525
I'm Lucas Nolan.

115
00:10:30.608 --> 00:10:32.576
What's your name?

116
00:10:35.488 --> 00:10:36.489
You tell me.

117
00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:40.251
You read people for a living, don't you?

118
00:10:42.662 --> 00:10:45.757
Dave. No, or is it Bob?

119
00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:48.802
Or maybe a good old Tommy.

120
00:10:48.877 --> 00:10:51.505
- You don't look like a Tommy.
- Mm.


121
00:10:51.588 --> 00:10:54.637
I read books. Far less annoying.

122
00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:57.640
Then let's talk about books.

123
00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:00.347
"If a tree falls in a park
and there is no one to hear,


124
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:04.401
it is silent, invisible, nameless.

125
00:11:04.475 --> 00:11:07.069
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.


126
00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:09.989
All meaning would vanish along with us."

127
00:11:13.318 --> 00:11:15.446
Let's talk about books now.

128
00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:17.155
What's he doing?

129
00:11:17.238 --> 00:11:18.706
Searching his memory house.

130
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:22.794
Am I the only one in here
who doesn't know


131
00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:24.462
what the fuck a memory house is?

132
00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:27.290
It's a memorization technique.

133
00:11:27.373 --> 00:11:29.046
You see, our visual memory
is the strongest,


134
00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:32.470
so Lucas has created a home in his mind
to remember anything and everything.


135
00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:34.422
That sounds like bullshit to me.

136
00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:38.176
"If a tree falls in the park...
[echoing]


137
00:11:40.803 --> 00:11:43.647
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.


138
00:11:43.723 --> 00:11:46.146
All meaning would vanish..."

139
00:11:48.394 --> 00:11:50.192
William Fossett.

140
00:11:50.271 --> 00:11:54.321
Natural States,
originally published in 1754.


141
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.744
However, he stole his line
of thinking from Berkeley,


142
00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:58.696
who asked the same question

143
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.408
with his Treatise on the
Principles of Human Knowledge.


144
00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:04.665
Section 45, if you wanna have a look.

145
00:12:06.037 --> 00:12:07.584
He's a game-changer.

146
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.801
So you are familiar with the work.

147
00:12:15.546 --> 00:12:17.640
It is a simple question, really.

148
00:12:17.715 --> 00:12:19.843
Either you believe physical phenomena

149
00:12:19.926 --> 00:12:23.897
can exist outside the realm
of human perception or you don't.


150
00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:30.653
Come on.
You must have an opinion.


151
00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:35.278
I'll answer one of your questions,
you answer one of mine.


152
00:12:35.358 --> 00:12:37.326
Sure.

153
00:12:37.402 --> 00:12:40.406
- Where were you born?
- That's his question?


154
00:12:40.488 --> 00:12:43.082
Iraq.

155
00:12:43.157 --> 00:12:46.286
Match up immigration records,
photos, whatever you got.


156
00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:47.461
Got it.

157
00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:52.466
Iran, Syria, Egypt, Gaza.

158
00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:54.294
[Sara]
He's playing us.


159
00:12:54.877 --> 00:12:56.754
Does it matter?

160
00:12:56.838 --> 00:12:59.341
Would you even be able
to tell the difference?


161
00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:01.722
- Hmm?
- Okay.


162
00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:05.647
- So you came here when you were--
- Ah, ah, ah.


163
00:13:05.722 --> 00:13:08.396
You're going to have to
earn your next question.


164
00:13:08.474 --> 00:13:09.896
I don't have time for games.

165
00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:12.570
No, you don't,
but you're going to play anyway.


166
00:13:15.023 --> 00:13:18.197
- What do you want?
- I want to be heard.


167
00:13:18.276 --> 00:13:21.951
But for that to happen,
I need someone to listen.


168
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.748
And if I don't?

169
00:13:26.534 --> 00:13:29.504
[exhales]
You'll find out in 27 minutes.


170
00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:30.831
Becky?

171
00:13:32.206 --> 00:13:34.083
[Becky]
Done.


172
00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:36.135
America doesn't negotiate
with terrorists.


173
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.965
It does today.
And there are rules.


174
00:13:40.048 --> 00:13:42.221
Do we understand each other?

175
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.973
I understand.

176
00:13:44.052 --> 00:13:46.020
Good.

177
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.648
The rules are simple.

178
00:13:49.724 --> 00:13:55.356
They are based on truth
in a world where everybody lies.


179
00:13:55.438 --> 00:14:00.114
With the biggest liars winning elections
and the greediest companies thriving,


180
00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:06.075
I am going to tell you the truth
about who I am and what I want.


181
00:14:06.157 --> 00:14:10.879
Then I'm going to ask you a question
based on that truth.


182
00:14:11.788 --> 00:14:15.418
You get it right, you win a prize.

183
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.300
You get it wrong,
people die right now.


184
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.053
I want electronic countermeasures
on this building.


185
00:14:23.132 --> 00:14:24.634
No wireless signals in or out.

186
00:14:24.717 --> 00:14:26.094
Got it.

187
00:14:27.178 --> 00:14:33.060
This whole nightmare of a country
is built on lies.


188
00:14:33.142 --> 00:14:37.488
Everywhere you look,
women with fake tits.


189
00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:41.613
You turn on the television,
all you see are reality shows,


190
00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:43.535
homes none of us own,

191
00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:46.865
a leader who says
he's going to take care of people.


192
00:14:46.948 --> 00:14:49.918
Online, you have a thousand friends,
and not one in real life.

All lies.

194
00:14:52.703 --> 00:14:55.377
And do you know
which ones are the worst?


195
00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:59.294
The ones you come to believe.

196
00:14:59.377 --> 00:15:01.721
And what is
the biggest lie of all?


197
00:15:05.133 --> 00:15:06.555
...the biggest lie of all.

198
00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:17.733
The American Dream.

199
00:15:18.271 --> 00:15:19.818
Well done.

200
00:15:21.315 --> 00:15:23.113
For that, you get a prize.

201
00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:28.574
- One question, one answer.
- Where's the next bomb gonna go off?

Corner of Nicollet and 5th.

203
00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:33.628
Get PD to evac the buildings

204
00:15:33.703 --> 00:15:35.455
for one square block
and set up a hard perimeter.


205
00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:37.632
I want SWAT and EOD
on Nicollet and 5th now.


206
00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:39.425
What's there, Becky?

207
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.879
Offices, storefronts,
a tower, apartments.


208
00:15:42.962 --> 00:15:44.680
- Too much.
- What are you doing?


209
00:15:44.755 --> 00:15:46.632
You can't just walk away from him.

210
00:15:46.716 --> 00:15:49.686
- We're both coming with you.
- Absolutely not.


211
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.683
- Why did he come in here?
- What?


212
00:15:51.762 --> 00:15:55.107
- Why did he give himself up?
- Because he's a psychopath.


213
00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:56.480
Yes. No. Maybe.

214
00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.186
But what he is doesn't matter.

215
00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:00.647
Why did he come in here?
Why did he give himself up?


216
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.028
Why did he just tell us
where the bomb is?


217
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:06.035
He doesn't think
we'll find it in time.


218
00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:09.247
And what, you think he's just
gonna show you where it is?


219
00:16:09.322 --> 00:16:12.246
Yes, but not from in here.
I need him on-site.


220
00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:13.827
He'll unconsciously give up more there

221
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.878
- than he ever would here.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.


222
00:16:15.953 --> 00:16:18.797
What if he is just lying
to get out of here?


223
00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:21.376
You're right. He is by definition,

224
00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:23.757
but that doesn't mean a bomb
isn't about to go off.


225
00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:26.806
If we wanna stop him, we have to
let him think he's in control.


226
00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:29.384
And what if he
is the one in control?

227
00:16:31.177 --> 00:16:32.770
He's not.

228
00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:38.893
Just let me do my thing.

229
00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:44.194
He's coming with.

230
00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:49.537
If this goes south, it's on you.

Oh, come on.

236
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.449
You could be stuck at your desk
talking about the lousy weather

or how the T-wolves are losing again

or what poisonous fast food
you're going to pick up for lunch.

Stuck in the same

with the same bullshit people
as every other day of your life.

Nothing like a ticking bomb
to get the blood pumping.

- Ever heard of a treadmill?
- Do I look like a hamster?

The bigger the crime,
the bigger the challenge.

And everybody wants
to beat the best.

your hollow pay-raise comes.

Hey, it's just my two cents.

I wish you'd chose a different path

'cause there was a fork
in your road somewhere.

see you at the bottom of a grave.

And how can you be so sure?

00:23:34.975 --> 00:23:36.977
Mortgage office.

316
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:40.064
Mortgage office, let's go!

317
00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:42.491
- [chatter]
- [panting]


318
00:24:29.697 --> 00:24:31.540
[beeping]

319
00:24:51.176 --> 00:24:52.473
[beeping stops]

320
00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:00.811
[sirens wailing]

321
00:25:10.654 --> 00:25:13.123
- Guess you're a hero now, Lucas.
- Am I?


322
00:25:13.198 --> 00:25:15.246
You are if you believe in causality.

323
00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:19.250
Cause and effect, you fire a gun,
the bullet hits something or someone.


324
00:25:19.329 --> 00:25:21.582
You cross the wrong man,
he wants to kill you.


325
00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:23.713
You disarm a bomb, you become a hero.

326
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:31.801
The thing about causality
is that it cuts both ways.


327
00:25:31.884 --> 00:25:37.266
Given a different effect, the same cause
can make a hero into a fool.


328
00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:49.030
Hey, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing? Hey, hey!


329
00:25:51.236 --> 00:25:53.455
- [Lucas] Get down!
- [explosion]


330
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.952
[people screaming]

[car alarms blaring]

332
00:26:01.497 --> 00:26:03.090
[man]
Where did he go?!


333
00:26:03.957 --> 00:26:05.334
Can you see him?
Can you see him?


334
00:26:07.419 --> 00:26:08.636
[man 2]
Don't let him get away!


335
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:19.849
[grunts]

336
00:26:42.871 --> 00:26:44.373

[grunts]

338
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.733
Okay, okay!

339
00:27:48.812 --> 00:27:50.735
I'm out.

340
00:28:00.157 --> 00:28:01.704
Drop it.

341
00:28:06.788 --> 00:28:09.758
On your knees.
Now!


342
00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:11.551
Okay.

343
00:28:13.837 --> 00:28:15.760
[kicks gun away]

- [computer beeps]
- Nobody move!


348
00:29:24.908 --> 00:29:28.503
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hands up now! Hands up!


349
00:29:47.931 --> 00:29:51.856
[man] We're training your mind,
Lucas, so you can do anything.


350
00:29:51.935 --> 00:29:54.108
Washington, Jefferson,
Buchanan, and Coolidge.


351
00:29:54.187 --> 00:29:56.064
Good.

352
00:29:56.148 --> 00:30:00.574
And now tell me, when you go
inside your memory house,


353
00:30:00.652 --> 00:30:02.780
is there anything more beautiful?

354
00:30:02.863 --> 00:30:06.663
Yes. A real house.

355
00:30:06.742 --> 00:30:08.915
Money isn't everything, Lucas.

356
00:30:08.994 --> 00:30:11.417
- God will provide--
- Well, can He buy us a house


357
00:30:11.496 --> 00:30:13.419
or a car or clothes?

358
00:30:13.498 --> 00:30:14.841
Because you can't.

359
00:30:21.631 --> 00:30:23.474
- [thunder rumbles]
- [alarm blaring]


360
00:30:28.347 --> 00:30:30.441
Dad, what did you do?

361
00:30:32.017 --> 00:30:33.860
Dad, it was my fault. I'm sorry.

362
00:30:37.939 --> 00:30:39.361
[sighs]

363
00:30:52.788 --> 00:30:54.586
[chatter]

364
00:31:32.536 --> 00:31:34.664
Why didn't you shoot him, Lucas?

365
00:31:36.456 --> 00:31:38.254
Because he has more bombs out there.

366
00:31:43.213 --> 00:31:46.137
- All right, Becky, what did he do?
- Not sure.


367
00:31:46.216 --> 00:31:50.767
- Whatever this is, it's encrypted.
- Well, if you had to guess.


368
00:31:50.846 --> 00:31:52.940
Well, this office is a data hub,

369
00:31:53.014 --> 00:31:55.062
so that means the servers
connect to bank alarm systems,


370
00:31:55.142 --> 00:31:56.485
to hospitals, to the airport.

371
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.609
Might be information or a virus.

372
00:31:59.688 --> 00:32:01.861
I won't know until
I crack the code and pull it apart.


373
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.159
Well, if it was a virus,
wouldn't the firewall stop it?


374
00:32:04.234 --> 00:32:06.202
He was already in the system.

375
00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:10.624
So you're telling us that
whatever he did can't be stopped?


376
00:32:10.699 --> 00:32:13.578
Yeah, short of unplugging everything
and causing a complete shutdown


377
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.710
in our financial, health, security,
and transportation system? No.


378
00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:22.211
Get back to the office.
Do whatever you have to do.


379
00:32:22.294 --> 00:32:24.467
- Just crack it.
- On it.


380
00:32:28.967 --> 00:32:30.310
He's done.

381
00:32:32.804 --> 00:32:34.431
He's just starting.

382
00:32:34.514 --> 00:32:37.358
He's lived his entire life
for this moment. You understand that?


383
00:32:37.434 --> 00:32:42.190
What I understand is that we've done
exactly what he wanted us to do.


384
00:32:42.272 --> 00:32:44.821
I'm taking over this interrogation.

385
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.197
Then you might as well
tell everybody to go home


386
00:32:46.276 --> 00:32:48.950
and start praying right now
because you're not gonna stop him.


387
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:51.373
And you are?

388
00:32:51.448 --> 00:32:53.246
He has been toying with you

389
00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:56.169
since the minute you walked
into that interrogation room.


390
00:32:56.244 --> 00:32:59.714
Two hours, and we know
exactly nothing about him.


391
00:32:59.789 --> 00:33:03.419
Not his name, where he lives,
what he wants, what his next target is.


392
00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:05.637
You're missing the point.

393
00:33:05.712 --> 00:33:07.931
It's not who his name is
or what he wants


394
00:33:08.006 --> 00:33:12.011
or even what he's gonna blow up next
because that is going to happen.


395
00:33:13.553 --> 00:33:15.976
Get him the hell out of here.

396
00:33:26.566 --> 00:33:28.159
Go home, Luke.

397
00:33:28.235 --> 00:33:31.580
Have a drink.
We'll take it from here.


398
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.576
Luke.

399
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.427
Lucas.

400
00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.277
- [grunting]
- [Sara] Hey!


401
00:34:02.352 --> 00:34:03.774
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:34:03.853 --> 00:34:05.821
- I know where he lives.
- You got an address?


403
00:34:05.897 --> 00:34:07.899
No, but I'll get you
within a quarter mile.


404
00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:14.202
- I'll bet my career on it.
- You just did. Well, let's go!


405
00:34:14.573 --> 00:34:15.950
[grunts]

406
00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:06.128
No one in there is going to talk to you
with me looking like this.


407
00:35:06.207 --> 00:35:07.880
Come on, this is undignified.

408
00:35:07.959 --> 00:35:09.051
Yeah.

409
00:35:11.087 --> 00:35:12.805
Well, here's your dignity.

410
00:35:21.139 --> 00:35:23.016
Hey, friend, spare a dollar?

411
00:35:34.402 --> 00:35:36.746
- [music playing]
- [men whistling]


412
00:35:36.821 --> 00:35:38.448
- [whooping]
- [glass shatters]


413
00:35:46.122 --> 00:35:48.045
[chatter]

414
00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.439
- [music stops]
- [man] Hey!


415
00:36:02.514 --> 00:36:05.142
- Bullshit.
- Hey, man.


416
00:36:05.225 --> 00:36:07.193
Special Agent Bennett.

417
00:36:08.687 --> 00:36:09.734
So?

418
00:36:09.813 --> 00:36:14.034
So... ass-face,

419
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:17.079
I want you to tell me
if you have seen this man before.


420
00:36:17.153 --> 00:36:18.951
No.

421
00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:24.536
You sure about that?

422
00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:27.668
Someone not quite
so rosy white walks in here,


423
00:36:27.747 --> 00:36:29.090
I'm pretty sure you'd remember that.

424
00:36:29.165 --> 00:36:30.758
I'm sure.

425
00:36:30.834 --> 00:36:34.930
If that face showed up in here,
I'd remember.


426
00:36:35.004 --> 00:36:38.725
So whatever you assholes
came in here for, it ain't here,


427
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.521
so why don't you do a little 180
and get the hell out of my bar?


428
00:36:42.595 --> 00:36:45.849
Unlike you, most people know
where they're not wanted.


429
00:36:45.932 --> 00:36:47.309
Mm.

430
00:36:49.978 --> 00:36:51.355
So what do you make of that?

431
00:36:51.438 --> 00:36:53.657
Looks like he was exactly
where he was wanted.


432
00:36:59.946 --> 00:37:01.994
[laughing]

433
00:37:03.825 --> 00:37:05.202
[man]
Whoo!


434
00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:13.213
So you believe all this garbage?

435
00:37:13.293 --> 00:37:15.546
What, that whites are superior?

436
00:37:15.628 --> 00:37:18.097
Mm-hmm. Better.

437
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:21.264
You know, I read a lot.

438
00:37:21.342 --> 00:37:23.891
Even disgusting crap like Mein Kampf.

439
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.597
You know what I know for sure?

440
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.479
Is that behind hate is fear.

441
00:37:29.768 --> 00:37:31.520
You're just a coward.

442
00:37:31.603 --> 00:37:37.281
Yeah, behind all this bravado,
you're just a scared little cunt.


443
00:37:37.358 --> 00:37:38.701
[grunts]

444
00:37:38.777 --> 00:37:40.700
- Hey, don't move!
- Stay back!


445
00:37:40.779 --> 00:37:44.579
- Don't move!
- Sit down. Now.


446
00:37:44.657 --> 00:37:46.876
- Don't move.
- I know you've seen him.


447
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:49.454
Fuck you!

448
00:37:49.537 --> 00:37:52.040
- [man] Hey!
- Don't move.


449
00:37:52.123 --> 00:37:53.375
[Sara]
Sit down.


450
00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:59.636
What about you?
Have you seen him?


451
00:37:59.714 --> 00:38:01.716
'Cause I've got all day
to bounce your head off this bar.


452
00:38:03.802 --> 00:38:05.554
Yeah, I've seen him a few times.

453
00:38:05.637 --> 00:38:07.059
Where does he live?

454
00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:10.483
- I know the dude. I don't fuck him.
- Why was he here?


455
00:38:10.558 --> 00:38:13.027
I'm guessing it wasn't for
the hospitality and hors d'oeuvres.


456
00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:16.277
- Freeze!
- Don't move.


457
00:38:22.195 --> 00:38:23.913
- [rock music playing]
- The feds, man! Heads up!


458
00:39:05.113 --> 00:39:06.786
- [music stops]
- [grunting]

[panting]

461
00:40:19.062 --> 00:40:20.359
Detonators.

462
00:40:25.193 --> 00:40:27.446
[chatter on dispatch]

463
00:40:27.528 --> 00:40:29.371
Thanks, man.

464
00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:36.963
Well, that was stupid.

465
00:40:38.414 --> 00:40:40.416
[sighs]
Probably.


466
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.468
No, definitely.

467
00:40:42.543 --> 00:40:46.673
You should've waited for backup.
You're too smart to let it get personal.


468
00:40:46.756 --> 00:40:49.305
You get stupid again
and you're out.


469
00:40:51.594 --> 00:40:53.096
The detonators are military grade.

470
00:40:53.179 --> 00:40:55.557
- Digital timers.
- Explosives?


471
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.313
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?


472
00:40:57.392 --> 00:41:00.612
This place is clean.
No explosives anywhere inside.


473
00:41:00.687 --> 00:41:02.485
You gotta give me
something better than that.


474
00:41:02.563 --> 00:41:06.033
Well, one of the detonator units
was missing from the box.


475
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:08.407
- That's the best I got.
- Shit.


476
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.787
I'm gonna go see
if they know anything.


477
00:41:10.863 --> 00:41:11.989
Mm-hmm.

478
00:41:12.907 --> 00:41:14.659
They won't know anything more.

479
00:41:14.742 --> 00:41:16.415
He kept his bomb components separate

480
00:41:16.494 --> 00:41:18.246
so only one can be
compromised at a time.


481
00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:21.583
But he lives close.
I bet we'll find our explosives there.


482
00:41:21.666 --> 00:41:24.715
- How can you be sure?
- He has no ID, no driver's license.


483
00:41:24.794 --> 00:41:26.888
He doesn't come up
on any CCTV matches,


484
00:41:26.963 --> 00:41:28.385
so he doesn't take the bus or train.

485
00:41:28.464 --> 00:41:30.137
Too much surveillance.

486
00:41:34.512 --> 00:41:36.355
You keeping it together, Luke?

487
00:41:38.683 --> 00:41:41.482
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

488
00:41:43.438 --> 00:41:45.486
'Cause you don't look fine.

489
00:41:50.236 --> 00:41:52.204
[terrorist's voice]
Come on, this is undignified.


490
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.328
[man]
I've seen him a few times.


491
00:41:54.407 --> 00:41:55.659
[Lucas]
Where does he live?


492
00:41:55.742 --> 00:41:58.040
[terrorist's voice] Do you think
any one of them would stop on the street


493
00:41:58.119 --> 00:41:59.996
and give you a quarter
if you were starving?


494
00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:01.797
Unbelievable.

495
00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:13.518
No, I've never seen him before.

496
00:42:13.593 --> 00:42:15.061
What's he doing?

497
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.690
Proving that no good deed
goes unpunished.


498
00:42:25.396 --> 00:42:27.524
Oh, thanks.

499
00:42:28.816 --> 00:42:29.863
Yeah, he lives
right around the corner...


500
00:42:29.942 --> 00:42:32.616
- Let's go!
- [officer] Come on, let's go.


501
00:42:32.695 --> 00:42:34.368
Prepare to move.
Follow where they're going.


502
00:42:34.447 --> 00:42:36.620
You're the boss. Let's go.

503
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.417
[door closes]

504
00:42:46.292 --> 00:42:47.589
Talk to me.

505
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:51.009
Had one wallet, empty.

506
00:42:51.089 --> 00:42:53.808
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.


507
00:42:53.883 --> 00:42:56.511
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.


508
00:42:56.594 --> 00:42:58.346
"MS" was scratched into the key, right?

509
00:43:03.893 --> 00:43:05.566
Melissa Smith, apartment 34.

510
00:43:07.021 --> 00:43:08.443
Wait.

511
00:43:08.523 --> 00:43:10.867
He's smarter than this.
He wanted us here.


512
00:43:10.942 --> 00:43:15.163
It's either part of the game
he has us playing or it's a trap.


513
00:43:17.406 --> 00:43:20.159
I want EOD at Jackson and Grant now.

514
00:43:21.953 --> 00:43:23.671
[sirens blaring in distance]

515
00:43:26.332 --> 00:43:27.754
Yep, I got it.

516
00:43:27.834 --> 00:43:29.677
All right, just got a hit
on Melissa Smith.


517
00:43:29.752 --> 00:43:32.221
She's 35, clerical worker,
unmarried, no children.


518
00:43:32.296 --> 00:43:34.765
Facebook page says she
likes cats and Internet dating.


519
00:43:34.841 --> 00:43:36.969
No Social Security,
no driver's license.


520
00:43:37.051 --> 00:43:38.644
It's an alias.
She doesn't exist.


521
00:43:38.719 --> 00:43:41.063
Perfect alias.
Wouldn't raise any flags.


522
00:43:41.139 --> 00:43:43.517
Okay, guys, this is taking too long.

523
00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:45.476
[officer]
Almost there.


524
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.562
We're all good. 
No booby traps.

525
00:43:47.645 --> 00:43:49.739
- We still need a warrant.
- Yeah, you get on that, Sara.


526
00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.188
What are they?

527
00:45:08.267 --> 00:45:12.773
Power grid. Water mains.
Gas lines. Internet.


528
00:45:12.855 --> 00:45:15.734
He's got a blueprint
to the entire city's infrastructure.


529
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.696
Bring him up.

530
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.250
- This is a crime scene.
- The real crime hasn't happened yet.


531
00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.336
Do it.

532
00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:31.586
Bring him up.

533
00:45:44.762 --> 00:45:46.014
[computer beeps]

534
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:54.108
What are you?

535
00:45:56.732 --> 00:45:58.234
Let's find out.

536
00:46:11.998 --> 00:46:14.626
Well, make yourselves at home.

537
00:46:14.709 --> 00:46:17.462
Uh, be careful with that, please.

538
00:46:19.547 --> 00:46:22.391
- Well?
- You're jerking me around.


539
00:46:22.466 --> 00:46:24.389
You're only starting
to figure that out?


540
00:46:24.468 --> 00:46:26.345
But you led us here on purpose.

541
00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:30.150
Who says I led you anywhere?
You're calling the shots.


542
00:46:30.224 --> 00:46:32.101
What I do know is that
you want me to keep playing.


543
00:46:32.184 --> 00:46:34.653
You've already lost.

544
00:46:34.729 --> 00:46:38.609
Well, then you won't mind if I walk.
It's hard playing against yourself.


545
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:42.946
Okay.

546
00:46:47.283 --> 00:46:50.162
I want you to keep playing.

547
00:46:50.244 --> 00:46:53.623
Then you're gonna have to make this
much more interesting.


548
00:47:00.963 --> 00:47:05.810
- What do you want?
- I want to change the world.


549
00:47:05.885 --> 00:47:08.354
Is that why you paint?
To change your world?


550
00:47:09.847 --> 00:47:11.019
The world's an ugly place.

551
00:47:11.098 --> 00:47:13.021
You wanna make it beautiful,
so you paint?


552
00:47:20.775 --> 00:47:23.403
You need a blank canvas, am I right?

553
00:47:29.408 --> 00:47:35.336
Everything around us is fake, Lucas.
Why shouldn't I burn it down?


554
00:47:35.414 --> 00:47:37.758
You must've had a fucked-up childhood.

555
00:47:39.126 --> 00:47:43.131
To end up like this, living like this,
I mean, you got some serious issues.


556
00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:47.852
But we both know where they came from.

557
00:47:47.927 --> 00:47:50.646
Really? And where is that, Lucas?

558
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.527
Women.

559
00:48:01.607 --> 00:48:04.110
Did some woman break your heart?

560
00:48:05.986 --> 00:48:07.408
Was it Mommy?

561
00:48:07.488 --> 00:48:11.038
[chuckles]
She didn't love you enough?


562
00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:14.041
Whatever it is,
it's clear that you hate women.


563
00:48:15.246 --> 00:48:18.796
You think you know me.
You don't know shit.


564
00:48:21.127 --> 00:48:22.549
Just got a hit on Melissa Smith.

565
00:48:22.628 --> 00:48:24.346
It's an alias.
She doesn't exist.


566
00:48:24.422 --> 00:48:26.140
She likes cats and Internet dating.

567
00:48:26.215 --> 00:48:28.309
...internet dating.

Internet dating...

00:48:36.183 --> 00:48:37.935
Wait, is that his laptop?

570
00:48:46.026 --> 00:48:48.279
Not surprising.
He used private browsing.


571
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:59.048
Nice hack. I see Becky's been
rubbing off on you a bit.


572
00:49:03.294 --> 00:49:05.217
We need to get her
on the phone right now.

[phone rings]

00:49:10.843 --> 00:49:13.813
- What's up?
- Beck, MNluvconnect.


575
00:49:13.888 --> 00:49:15.982
Run any woman he might've met
in the last six months


576
00:49:16.056 --> 00:49:19.185
against construction companies,
uh, demolition firms,

00:49:19.268 --> 00:49:22.442
commercial contractors, anyone you can
cross-reference with explosives.


578
00:49:24.857 --> 00:49:26.530
A password would be great.

579
00:49:30.154 --> 00:49:33.078
Seems to me like you have
two options, Lucas.


580
00:49:33.157 --> 00:49:36.036
You can get a warrant,
or you can ask me.


581
00:49:36.118 --> 00:49:40.214
Not enough time for one,
too much pride for the other.


582
00:49:40.289 --> 00:49:43.668
Pity. You were doing so well.

If we wanna stop him,


585
00:49:52.801 --> 00:49:54.053
we have to let him think
he's in control.

- Nothing.

It was him. I'm sitting right here.
Fifty seconds and she blows, Lucas.

- Stop it.
- Shoot me.

- Throw it out the window.
- He can't do that.

00:50:09.902 --> 00:50:11.404
He knows the answer he needs is inside.

593
00:50:11.487 --> 00:50:15.458
He throws it out,
he has nothing, and I win.

00:53:52.458 --> 00:53:55.302
If I had known it was him,
I swear I would have turned him in.


627
00:53:55.377 --> 00:53:57.129
How much did he take?

628
00:53:59.882 --> 00:54:02.635
- A lot.
- Oh, Christ...


629
00:54:02.718 --> 00:54:04.140
Show us, please.

630
00:54:12.102 --> 00:54:13.945
It's like these drums here.

631
00:54:15.355 --> 00:54:16.447
Take him outside.

632
00:54:21.695 --> 00:54:24.619
Okay, so he stole
two barrels off you.


633
00:54:24.698 --> 00:54:26.416
- A little over a week ago.
- [phone rings]


634
00:54:26.492 --> 00:54:28.836
What kind?
What's its application?


635
00:54:28.911 --> 00:54:30.458
- It's the powder form.
- [Sara] Go ahead.


636
00:54:30.537 --> 00:54:32.084
It's highly conductive.

637
00:54:32.164 --> 00:54:34.792
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges


638
00:54:34.875 --> 00:54:37.003
or apply it to pretty much anything.

639
00:54:37.085 --> 00:54:39.133
Like what?

640
00:54:39.213 --> 00:54:42.262
Plaster, concrete, paper, paint even.

641
00:54:42.341 --> 00:54:46.812
We use it mainly to pour into drilled,
reinforced concrete supports,


642
00:54:46.887 --> 00:54:49.857
then let it dry
for three days and then...


643
00:54:49.932 --> 00:54:52.776
- ...we detonate.
- Oh, Christ.


644
00:54:54.102 --> 00:54:55.479
[Sara] Guys.

645
00:54:57.189 --> 00:54:58.566
Don't move.

646
00:55:00.025 --> 00:55:01.322
[sighs]

647
00:55:03.445 --> 00:55:06.289
Vasti Radan.
Very little on him.


648
00:55:06.365 --> 00:55:09.244
We did get a hit on his father,
a Magid Radan.


649
00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:12.170
Tax records show that he worked for
a private security agency


650
00:55:12.246 --> 00:55:14.123
called Simons Security.

651
00:55:14.206 --> 00:55:17.426
It's basic rent-a-cop
that contracts out to federal agencies.


652
00:55:17.501 --> 00:55:20.129
He was good for three years,
then he was found drunk on the job.


653
00:55:20.212 --> 00:55:23.557
Company fired him,
he lost everything and more.


654
00:55:23.632 --> 00:55:25.600
He was sued for unpaid debts.

655
00:55:25.676 --> 00:55:28.179
His home was foreclosed on.
He fell off the map.


656
00:55:28.262 --> 00:55:31.641
Two years later, he was found
dead in an alley in Chinatown.


657
00:55:31.723 --> 00:55:34.522
- So this is personal.
- Good.


658
00:55:34.601 --> 00:55:38.401
- How the hell is any of this good?
- That means his targets aren't random.


659
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:43.077
There's a... a method behind them,
a logic pattern.


660
00:55:43.151 --> 00:55:45.574
[Eric]
But what pattern? That's the question.


661
00:55:45.654 --> 00:55:47.406
I'm not sure yet.

662
00:55:49.283 --> 00:55:51.456
All right, what do you wanna do?

663
00:55:53.203 --> 00:55:54.625
Ask him.

664
00:56:03.213 --> 00:56:05.261
- Book her.
- [Joan scoffs]


665
00:56:19.688 --> 00:56:21.315
Do you miss your dad?

666
00:56:22.733 --> 00:56:25.577
Hmm. She told you my name.

667
00:56:25.652 --> 00:56:29.498
Yep. You wanted her to.

668
00:56:29.573 --> 00:56:33.828
- And why would I do that?
- So I can figure out why you did it.


669
00:56:36.872 --> 00:56:41.753
What you want
is locked up in here.


670
00:56:41.835 --> 00:56:44.088
I don't think you have the time...

671
00:56:46.173 --> 00:56:50.053
...or the talents
to unlock this vault.


672
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:53.059
Seems a waste of water
to wash a car in the rain.


673
00:56:56.725 --> 00:56:59.399
[Sara]
Power grid, water mains, gas lines.


674
00:56:59.478 --> 00:57:02.027
He's got a blueprint to
the entire city's infrastructure.


675
00:57:06.568 --> 00:57:10.618
- Hey, Why'd you turn the water off?
- Water mains.


676
00:57:10.697 --> 00:57:13.576
[dispatch]
Explosion reported. 9355th Avenue.


677
00:57:18.497 --> 00:57:20.465
- He just hit the--
- The water department.


678
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.542
And two substations.
They're shutting down the pumps.


679
00:57:22.626 --> 00:57:25.630
- All of them. And without water...
- The fire department can't fight fires.


680
00:57:25.712 --> 00:57:27.760
Eric, he is finished.

681
00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:30.217
Get him in the car. We're taking him
back to the federal building.


682
00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.394
[grunts]

683
00:57:32.469 --> 00:57:33.721
What's it going to be, Lucas?

684
00:57:33.804 --> 00:57:35.306
- More talking?
- No.


685
00:57:35.389 --> 00:57:36.982
I've done enough of that.
It's your turn.


686
00:57:37.057 --> 00:57:38.900
Tell me everything I know.

687
00:57:38.976 --> 00:57:40.853
You know my father was a drunk.

688
00:57:40.936 --> 00:57:43.780
He was fired from his job
and lost everything.


689
00:57:43.855 --> 00:57:46.153
And you know
or should know or will know


690
00:57:46.233 --> 00:57:48.986
that my mother died
six months after that.


691
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:53.540
I lived on the streets and was forced
to fend for myself, educate myself.


692
00:57:53.615 --> 00:57:57.995
Everything I am today is because
of a system of people like you.


693
00:57:58.078 --> 00:58:00.251
You know that I have
over a thousand pounds


694
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.503
of high explosives
somewhere in the city


695
00:58:02.582 --> 00:58:04.550
and that I am not afraid
to detonate them.


696
00:58:04.626 --> 00:58:08.096
But what you don't know
is where or really why.


697
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:10.344
Now, you can take me
to Gitmo and torture me,


698
00:58:10.424 --> 00:58:12.518
but we both know that won't work.

699
00:58:12.592 --> 00:58:13.844
And you can even offer me money,

700
00:58:13.927 --> 00:58:16.897
but you know I would only laugh
in your smug face.


701
00:58:16.972 --> 00:58:19.225
- [grunts]
- [Sara] Hey!


702
00:58:19.307 --> 00:58:22.982
Hey, hey, hey, come on!
Get him off! Get off!


703
00:58:23.061 --> 00:58:25.109
- Come on!
- Lucas! Lucas!


704
00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:26.610
Get him in the car.

705
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:29.364
You take yourself so seriously.

706
00:58:29.443 --> 00:58:33.949
Go home. That's an order. Go.

707
00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:41.588
[siren blaring]

708
00:58:44.708 --> 00:58:46.631
Got a wallet with some kind of
paint smudge on it.


709
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:49.634
It's a powder form.
Highly conductive.


710
00:58:49.713 --> 00:58:52.432
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges


711
00:58:52.507 --> 00:58:54.851
or apply it to pretty much anything.

712
00:58:54.926 --> 00:58:56.348
[Lucas]
Like what?


713
00:58:56.428 --> 00:58:58.396
...paint even.

714
00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.609
Paint.
[echoes]


715
00:59:02.684 --> 00:59:04.106
[Eric]
Some kind of paint smudge on it.


716
00:59:07.522 --> 00:59:09.945
[tires screeching]

717
00:59:11.735 --> 00:59:13.954
[horn honks]

718
00:59:17.699 --> 00:59:19.576
[chatter]

719
00:59:19.659 --> 00:59:21.252
I gotta go.

720
00:59:21.328 --> 00:59:22.796
- Hey, hey!
- [metal detector chirping]


721
00:59:22.871 --> 00:59:24.794
It's okay, let him go.

722
00:59:24.873 --> 00:59:26.500
[keyboard clacking]

723
00:59:30.879 --> 00:59:32.381
What are you doing here, Lucas?

724
00:59:32.464 --> 00:59:33.841
- Evidence.
- What?


725
00:59:33.924 --> 00:59:35.801
Vasti Radan's wallet. I need it.

726
00:59:38.136 --> 00:59:39.979
Lucas, you can't take that.

727
00:59:41.181 --> 00:59:42.478
I need an explosives test kit.

728
00:59:44.684 --> 00:59:45.981
[phone rings]

729
00:59:46.061 --> 00:59:47.563
[chatter]

730
00:59:54.903 --> 00:59:56.246
There you are.

731
00:59:59.741 --> 01:00:02.369
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a minute.


732
01:00:24.766 --> 01:00:27.861
The paint.
He mixed explosives with paint.


733
01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:30.317
- A building?
- Maybe.


734
01:00:30.397 --> 01:00:32.365
There's over 200,000 in the city alone.

735
01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.283
It'll take months to check
every single one of them.


736
01:00:34.359 --> 01:00:35.736
We need to find out where he worked.

737
01:00:35.819 --> 01:00:36.911
It would have
something to do with painting.


738
01:00:36.987 --> 01:00:40.207
Commercial painting, uh,
I need you to find out where.


739
01:00:40.282 --> 01:00:42.125
There's no job records,
there's no EDD filings,


740
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.952
there's no tax records
for a Vasti Radan.


741
01:00:44.035 --> 01:00:45.753
- He used an alias.
- What alias?


742
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:48.127
I need a name.

743
01:00:48.206 --> 01:00:50.334
Let's talk about books, then.

744
01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:54.092
"If a tree falls in the park
and there is no one to hear..."


745
01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:55.514
William Fossett.

746
01:00:59.551 --> 01:01:01.770
A William Fossett
was terminated from his position


747
01:01:01.845 --> 01:01:04.473
at a commercial painting company
after starting three days ago.


748
01:01:07.893 --> 01:01:10.237
His employer, Bleaker Paint Works,

749
01:01:10.312 --> 01:01:14.158
filed a charge for a trespass
and illegal entry into their warehouse.


750
01:01:14.232 --> 01:01:16.530
Seems like he stole some supplies.

751
01:01:19.654 --> 01:01:22.077
When the PD checked the address,
it didn't exist.


752
01:01:22.157 --> 01:01:24.410
I need his most job recent site, Beck.

753
01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:34.461
They were contracted to paint
the inside of the Federal Reserve Bank.


754
01:01:34.544 --> 01:01:38.469
- You did it, Lucas.
- I didn't.


755
01:01:39.382 --> 01:01:40.634
- Get Eric.
- Yeah.


756
01:01:42.427 --> 01:01:44.555
[line ringing]

757
01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:49.063
[sighs]
No answer. Shit.


758
01:01:53.521 --> 01:01:56.570
I was starting to think
you weren't going to make it.


759
01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.407
[siren blaring]

760
01:02:06.952 --> 01:02:08.670
How are you holding up, buddy?

761
01:02:09.746 --> 01:02:11.999
[phone rings]

762
01:02:12.082 --> 01:02:13.459
Wanna tell me
what the hell you're doing, Lucas?


763
01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:15.714
- Solving a case.
- [Eric] No, you're the case now.


764
01:02:15.794 --> 01:02:17.421
Bring him back, turn yourself in.

765
01:02:17.504 --> 01:02:19.131
- Can't do that, Eric.
- We talked to Becky.


766
01:02:19.214 --> 01:02:21.717
We know about the Federal Reserve.
EOD teams are en route now.


767
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.052
[Lucas]
They won't find it.


768
01:02:23.134 --> 01:02:24.727
- What are you talking about?
- The paint.


769
01:02:24.803 --> 01:02:26.805
It takes three days to dry.
He quit three days ago.


770
01:02:26.888 --> 01:02:29.562
He's gonna detonate it and he doesn't
think we can stop him in time.


771
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:32.064
- Hold on, hold on!
- [tires screeching]


772
01:02:32.143 --> 01:02:34.441
[horn honks]

773
01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:36.489
Shit.

774
01:02:40.944 --> 01:02:42.867
Okay, so what do you wanna do?

775
01:02:42.946 --> 01:02:45.574
I'm gonna give him a choice:
life or death.


776
01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:47.876
You wanna take him inside?

777
01:02:47.951 --> 01:02:49.874
[Lucas]
About America. How unfair it is.


778
01:02:49.953 --> 01:02:51.671
So he wants to burn
the Federal Reserve to the ground.


779
01:02:51.746 --> 01:02:53.544
But I don't think
he's willing to die to make his point.


780
01:02:53.623 --> 01:02:56.843
- And if you're wrong?
- I'm not.


781
01:03:05.468 --> 01:03:06.765
Go, go, go, go, go!

Stop backseat driving!

784
01:03:14.185 --> 01:03:16.608
Maybe he's onto something.
He hasn't steered us wrong yet.


785
01:03:16.688 --> 01:03:18.736
Yeah, well, he hasn't steered us
right yet either.

Priority command,
Special Agent Lucas Nolan.

He's heading to the Federal Reserve
with a suspected terrorist.


788
01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:25.663
I want them stopped.

Freeze!

Put your hands up! Knees!

01:04:02.609 --> 01:04:04.077

Put it down!
Drop it!

- Drop it!
- You drop it!

- You put it down!
- I said drop it! Now! Now!


801
01:04:27.926 --> 01:04:29.348
Kick it over.

[groans, sighs]

807
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.952
[Vasti]
That was fun.


808
01:05:43.877 --> 01:05:46.380
Just act normal or I'll shoot you.

809
01:05:46.463 --> 01:05:50.684
Lucas Nolan, FBI.
I need to speak to someone in charge.


810
01:05:50.758 --> 01:05:53.511
Edward Watson,
building facility manager.


811
01:05:53.595 --> 01:05:56.064
Everyone's cleared out
of the building now.


812
01:05:56.139 --> 01:05:58.938
Okay, good.
Was the bank painted recently?


813
01:05:59.017 --> 01:06:00.610
Uh, yes.

814
01:06:00.685 --> 01:06:02.562
How much of the bank
was painted, Mr. Watson?


815
01:06:02.645 --> 01:06:05.774
Well, everything.
Over 200,000 square feet.


816
01:06:05.857 --> 01:06:09.111
- How much time do we have?
- Not enough.


817
01:06:10.904 --> 01:06:13.578
What you want
is locked up in here.


818
01:06:13.656 --> 01:06:16.580
I don't think you have
the time or the talents


819
01:06:16.659 --> 01:06:19.003
to unlock this vault.

820
01:06:20.872 --> 01:06:22.044
Did they paint the vault?

821
01:06:22.123 --> 01:06:23.750
- Uh, yes.
- Take us there, please.


822
01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:25.301
Uh, this way.

823
01:06:27.045 --> 01:06:29.389
- Do you still have power?
- Uh, some.


824
01:06:29.464 --> 01:06:32.058
Backup generator's enough
to run basic systems.


825
01:06:32.133 --> 01:06:34.181
- Surveillance cameras?
- Uh, no.


826
01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.434
Not until power's restored,
but that won't happen till 6:00 PM.


827
01:06:39.724 --> 01:06:41.067
Check down there.

828
01:06:41.142 --> 01:06:42.610
Down here.

829
01:06:46.105 --> 01:06:47.607
Tell me about the vault.

830
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:51.866
Thirty feet of reinforced steel,
set 60 feet below street level.


831
01:06:51.945 --> 01:06:54.869
It's designed to be almost
impregnable from outside attack.


832
01:06:54.948 --> 01:06:56.700
So how much is in there?

833
01:06:57.575 --> 01:07:01.125
Twenty billion in coin and currency
come through here every year.


834
01:07:01.204 --> 01:07:03.002
Right now at the end of the month,

835
01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:05.334
- close to three billion.
- [whistles]


836
01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:07.464
Exterior doors are
electronically controlled.


837
01:07:07.544 --> 01:07:09.967
No getting in or out
unless the guard inside knows you.


838
01:07:11.839 --> 01:07:13.261
- Watson, Edward.
- [lock clicks]

Please. The currency
is surrounded by an electrical field.


845
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.454
If you touch even a single bill,
full lockdown will occur.


846
01:07:48.126 --> 01:07:49.799
No detonator.

847
01:07:51.462 --> 01:07:52.930
God damn it, Lucas.

848
01:07:53.006 --> 01:07:54.929
Take your weapon out,
put it on the ground.


849
01:07:55.008 --> 01:07:57.727
- Now!
- The paint is the explosive.


850
01:07:57.802 --> 01:08:00.146
We gotta stop this.
It's gonna blow somehow.


851
01:08:00.221 --> 01:08:02.644
The detonator, it's in here.

852
01:08:02.724 --> 01:08:04.226
Check it out.

853
01:08:08.271 --> 01:08:10.319
[man]
Explosive is confirmed.


854
01:08:10.398 --> 01:08:11.945
[man 2] I'm not picking up a detonator.

855
01:08:12.025 --> 01:08:13.447
[man 2]
I'm not finding any detonators either.


856
01:08:13.526 --> 01:08:15.199
Okay, what else is in here
besides money?


857
01:08:15.278 --> 01:08:20.079
Plates and electronic currency
wiring stations in there.


858
01:08:20.158 --> 01:08:21.876
- What for?
- We can wire money


859
01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:23.077
anywhere in the world.

860
01:08:23.161 --> 01:08:24.583
All you need is an account number.

861
01:08:24.662 --> 01:08:27.040
[Vasti]
Can you feel it, Lucas?


862
01:08:27.123 --> 01:08:32.129
The energy is positively electric.
We're so close, I can taste it.


863
01:08:32.211 --> 01:08:35.090
Can you?
No?


864
01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:39.223
Maybe you should try harder.
How am I going to do it?


865
01:08:39.302 --> 01:08:42.681
How am I going to detonate
all this explosive?


866
01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.940
I've given you the answer,
all the tells, everything you need.


867
01:08:48.019 --> 01:08:52.274
Now, impress me.
How am I going to get away with it?


868
01:08:52.357 --> 01:08:54.155
Or am I?

869
01:08:55.943 --> 01:08:57.695
[Lucas]
You still have surveillance cameras?


870
01:08:57.779 --> 01:08:59.122
No, not until power is restored.

871
01:08:59.197 --> 01:09:01.541
We heard that's gonna happen at 6:00 PM.

872

No.

Mr. Watson, do you have
a phone line to the outside?

Uh, there.

- Do you have Joan Marian?


882
01:09:34.232 --> 01:09:36.155
- She's in interview three.
- I need to talk to her.


883
01:09:36.234 --> 01:09:38.407
- Now?
- Yes, now. Right now.


884
01:09:46.869 --> 01:09:47.961
It's Lucas Nolan.

885
01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:51.090
- Yes?
- Mrs. Marian,


886
01:09:51.165 --> 01:09:52.963
you said the explosives
were highly conductive.


887
01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:55.295
- Conductive of what?
- Electricity.


888
01:09:55.378 --> 01:09:57.972
That's how we detonate it.
We use electrical current.


889
01:09:58.047 --> 01:10:00.596
There's electrical current everywhere.
Why is it stable?


890
01:10:00.675 --> 01:10:02.052
It's because of the differentials.

891
01:10:02.135 --> 01:10:04.604
It responds to rapid
fluctuations in current.


892
01:10:10.935 --> 01:10:12.903
The building's the detonator.

893
01:10:12.979 --> 01:10:14.322
It's gonna blow
when the power comes back on.


894
01:10:14.397 --> 01:10:18.322
We need to get out of here.
Eric, now!


895
01:10:18.401 --> 01:10:20.824
Okay, I was wrong about him.
I didn't understand.


896
01:10:20.903 --> 01:10:22.280
I thought he cared about living.
He doesn't.


897
01:10:22.363 --> 01:10:24.866
In order for his plan to work,
he needs to die.


898
01:10:24.949 --> 01:10:26.121
Oh, Christ.

899
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.123
Okay, this vault
is gonna blow at 6:00.


900
01:10:29.162 --> 01:10:31.585
- [grunts]
- No, no, no.


901
01:10:31.664 --> 01:10:35.464
Shh. Well done.
I must say I am impressed.


902
01:10:35.543 --> 01:10:37.341
- Let her go.
- Then they'll shoot me.


903
01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.673
- Fine, then take me.
- Why?


904
01:10:39.756 --> 01:10:42.930
Because I'm willing to pay the price.
These people aren't. She's not.


905
01:10:43.509 --> 01:10:46.604
Okay. Walk towards me.

906
01:10:51.142 --> 01:10:53.395
Slowly. Slowly.

907
01:10:53.478 --> 01:10:55.697
- Take the shot if you get it.
- Copy that.


908
01:10:59.859 --> 01:11:04.615
Now the lesson is over.
Now go.


909
01:11:04.697 --> 01:11:07.416
- We're not fucking moving anywhere.
- You need to get out of here now!


910
01:11:07.492 --> 01:11:09.745
- Not without you.

- Eric, go!

- Hey.
- Becky, what did you hear?


923
01:11:42.193 --> 01:11:44.662
The explosive is triggered by
electrical current fluctuations.


924
01:11:44.737 --> 01:11:46.284
Okay, get with
the power company right now.

01:11:46.364 --> 01:11:48.492
Tell them not to
turn the power back on.

- Maybe he's alive.
- Open the door.

01:11:53.871 --> 01:11:55.714
- I can't.
- Open the goddamn door!

I can't! Nobody can.
Not until an hour after lockdown.

01:11:58.459 --> 01:12:00.382
Oh, Jesus!

931
01:12:01.212 --> 01:12:02.839
I need welders down here now.

01:12:03.881 --> 01:12:06.475
- Becky?
- I can't do anything. I'm on hold.

01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:17.444
Please tell me he's gonna be all right.

935
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.397
Everything's gonna be fine.

936
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.280
[explosion]

937
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.420
[siren blares in distance]

938
01:13:09.405 --> 01:13:11.282
[beeping]

939
01:13:13.534 --> 01:13:15.411
[alarm beeping]

940
01:13:20.207 --> 01:13:21.459
What the hell?

941
01:13:23.127 --> 01:13:24.754
[line beeping]

942
01:13:24.837 --> 01:13:26.635
[chatter]

943
01:13:29.467 --> 01:13:31.014
My computer just shut down.

944
01:13:31.093 --> 01:13:32.891
Same here.
It's erasing the files.


945
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:34.938
Damn it.

946
01:13:38.392 --> 01:13:39.939
What's happening, 9W5?

947
01:13:40.019 --> 01:13:42.772
The virus, it's wiping the servers,
the backups, everything.


948
01:13:42.855 --> 01:13:44.732
Shit.

949
01:13:47.652 --> 01:13:50.246
[reporters overlapping]
Four bombs and only two casualties.


950
01:13:50.321 --> 01:13:51.823
- It appears...
- Special Agent Lucas Nolan


951
01:13:51.906 --> 01:13:55.001
is credited with saving the lives
of numerous federal agents and local...


952
01:13:55.076 --> 01:13:58.125
Estimates put the paper losses
in the range of $3 billion,


953
01:13:58.204 --> 01:14:00.707
- however, as the money never...
- FBI's Minneapolis office


954
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:02.337
experienced a cyber attack.

955
01:14:02.416 --> 01:14:04.384
Their secured servers
systematically erased all data,


956
01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.930
including records involving
suspected bomber Vasti Radan.


957
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:20.976
[sighs]

958
01:14:24.188 --> 01:14:28.489
I'm honored to give the eulogy

959
01:14:28.567 --> 01:14:31.320
for Lucas Nolan today.

960
01:14:31.404 --> 01:14:33.327
A colleague...

961
01:14:34.865 --> 01:14:36.993
...and a close friend.

962
01:14:37.076 --> 01:14:43.379
A man who came from literally nothing
to becoming the best behavioral analyst


963
01:14:43.457 --> 01:14:45.835
I have ever worked with.

964
01:14:45.918 --> 01:14:50.219
A childhood of poverty,
a life on the streets,


965
01:14:50.297 --> 01:14:54.473
and... and the ability to find courage

966
01:14:54.552 --> 01:14:56.395
in the face of what happened
to his father


967
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:59.815
was a testament to Lucas's
strong-willed mind.


968
01:15:02.226 --> 01:15:05.230
A mind that...
that baffled us all.


969
01:15:06.605 --> 01:15:08.778
As we remember Lucas today,

970
01:15:10.985 --> 01:15:13.238
let's hold him in our hearts

971
01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.199
and remember him,
not just the colleague...


972
01:15:18.034 --> 01:15:21.789
...and not just a hero,
because he was.


973
01:15:23.122 --> 01:15:25.295
Let's remember a friend.

974
01:15:27.752 --> 01:15:30.096
God bless Lucas and Godspeed.

975
01:15:34.091 --> 01:15:36.560
Yep, that's quite the send-off.

976
01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:43.688
- Come on!
- [grunts]


977
01:15:43.768 --> 01:15:46.442
- [grunting]
- [boy] Hey!


978
01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.397
Get him!
[whimpers]


979
01:15:48.481 --> 01:15:50.529
Get off him now.

980
01:15:50.608 --> 01:15:52.827
- I'm Lucas.
- I'm Vasti.


981
01:16:01.452 --> 01:16:03.045
[alarm blaring]

982
01:16:06.457 --> 01:16:08.551
You gonna put down my gun now?

983
01:16:09.418 --> 01:16:10.920
Can I?

984
01:16:11.003 --> 01:16:12.755
How do I know
you're still with the plan?


985
01:16:12.838 --> 01:16:15.637
It wasn't the easiest plan to follow,
but I stayed on point.


986
01:16:15.716 --> 01:16:17.138
Really?

987
01:16:17.218 --> 01:16:19.186
That was some convincing shit, brother.

988
01:16:19.261 --> 01:16:21.730
Oh, you think so?
I thought maybe I went over the top.


989
01:16:21.806 --> 01:16:23.649
Are you kidding me? You had me
thinking you were one of them.


990
01:16:23.724 --> 01:16:25.567
Well, what about that accent?
Where'd you pick that up?


991
01:16:25.643 --> 01:16:26.895
I had five years to work on it.

992
01:16:26.977 --> 01:16:28.024
And Why'd you come on
so hard in the fight?


993
01:16:28.104 --> 01:16:31.028
- Dude, you shot at me.
- I shot near you.


994
01:16:31.107 --> 01:16:33.405
- Okay, whatever.
- We gotta get going. You ready?


995
01:16:34.652 --> 01:16:36.199
Yeah.

996
01:16:40.533 --> 01:16:41.750
Here we go.

997
01:16:41.826 --> 01:16:43.169
- [beeps]
- Giddyup.


998
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.049
[explosion]

999
01:17:10.354 --> 01:17:11.526
That's a lot of zeros.

1000
01:17:17.153 --> 01:17:19.656
- We good?
- Oh, we are so good.


1001
01:17:20.823 --> 01:17:21.949
Let's go.

1002
01:17:28.414 --> 01:17:30.337
- I hate tight spaces.
- [Lucas] You got this.


1003
01:17:33.878 --> 01:17:35.721
[groans]

1004
01:17:35.796 --> 01:17:39.391
Okay, this is the only
part of the plan I was not crazy about.


1005
01:17:39.466 --> 01:17:41.059
- [Lucas] You okay?
- Yeah, I got this.


1006
01:17:41.135 --> 01:17:42.557
How much time before
the water comes back on?


1007
01:17:42.636 --> 01:17:44.638
We got six minutes, so we gotta book it.
Let's go.


1008
01:17:44.722 --> 01:17:46.816
- All right, ladies first.
- Yeah, suck it up, buttercup.


1009
01:17:46.891 --> 01:17:48.143
[Vasti groans]

1010
01:17:50.311 --> 01:17:51.984
You okay back there?

1011
01:17:52.062 --> 01:17:55.612
Yeah, aside from the 2,000 pounds
of high explosives on my ass.


1012
01:17:59.945 --> 01:18:01.743
[exhales]

1013
01:18:01.822 --> 01:18:03.540
[rumbling]

1014
01:18:05.993 --> 01:18:08.041
That means the water's coming.
We gotta haul ass!


1015
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.219
Water's coming!

1016
01:18:18.297 --> 01:18:20.140
Go, go, go, go, go!

1017
01:18:23.761 --> 01:18:27.265
[grunting groaning]

1018
01:18:27.348 --> 01:18:30.101
[both chuckling]

1019
01:18:44.782 --> 01:18:46.329
All right, man, we should get going.

1020
01:18:47.826 --> 01:18:51.000
- One last stop.
- Yep.


1021
01:19:19.066 --> 01:19:21.945
[Lucas]
Knight to queen four. Checkmate.


1022
01:19:34.248 --> 01:19:36.842
I heard you were dead.

1023
01:19:36.917 --> 01:19:40.171
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1024
01:19:46.635 --> 01:19:48.603
Come on.

1025
01:19:48.679 --> 01:19:51.432
Plane's waiting.
Fake passports cost me a fortune.


1026
01:19:51.515 --> 01:19:54.268
Uh, is there any rush?

1027
01:19:59.523 --> 01:20:01.070
Not anymore.

1028
01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:02.743
[radio chatter]

1029
01:20:05.321 --> 01:20:09.201
[reporter] The terrorist responsible
and a hero perished in the attack.


1030
01:20:09.283 --> 01:20:14.130
But today, we look forward
knowing that as a people we are unbowed.


1031
01:20:14.204 --> 01:20:15.877
In other news, an anonymous donor

1032
01:20:15.956 --> 01:20:19.085
has pledged $100 million
for the establishment


1033
01:20:19.168 --> 01:20:20.966
of scholarships and other services

1034
01:20:21.045 --> 01:20:23.764
for homeless children in and around
the Minneapolis area.


1035
01:20:28.218 --> 01:20:30.641
[Lucas] So what drives a person
to commit a crime?


1036
01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:32.473
I guess I'm that individual

1037
01:20:32.556 --> 01:20:35.230
who found the smallest chink
in the system's armor


1038
01:20:35.309 --> 01:20:37.732
and benefited from it.
