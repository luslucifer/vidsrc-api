1
00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:14.105
...whether to approve or deny
the application.


2
00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.441
They're the decision-makers.

3
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.819
And you will receive a copy
of my proposed recommendation


4
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.529
and can attend
that board meeting


5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.573
and present your information
directly to them.


6
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.034
With regard
to this proceeding,


7
00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.286
basically,
there are four elements


8
00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.289
that I have to...

9
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.832
Receive information
regarding...


10
00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:42.591
Everybody,
let's get out of here.


11
00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.010
Now!

12
00:00:44.052 --> 00:00:46.429
Watch the electricity line!

13
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.181
All that I can see,

14
00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:49.807
it looks like part
of the building


15
00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.185
has been blown away.

16
00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:53.578
We'll have to bank
around the other side


17
00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:55.688
so I can get a better view
of it.


18
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.773
The explosion, though,
went off around 9 a.m.,


19
00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:01.569
and we could feel the explosion
in the newsroom of Channel 9


20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.739
at least
five miles from downtown.


21
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.385
As the chopper goes around the
side of the Federal Building...


22
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.410
Jeez, wow!

23
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:09.952
Look at that shot.

24
00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.538
It is absolutely incredible.

25
00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.622
The side of the Federal Building
has been blown off.


26
00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:14.623
Jesse?

27
00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:16.834
About a third...

28
00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:20.213
About a third of the
building has been blown away.


29
00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:22.298
This is just devastating.

30
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.186
That morning,
I was not in my office.


31
00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:23.818
I was at a fundraiser
about 30 miles away.


32
00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.321
We had a 9:00 start,

33
00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:28.739
when all of a sudden,
my phone went off,


34
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:32.076
and I was told that there'd been
some type of an explosion


35
00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.579
at the Murrah Building.

36
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.830
The greatest fear I have

37
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:39.417
is that we have casualties
in the thousands.


38
00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.709
At any one time,
there could be


39
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.963
a couple of thousand people
in that building.


40
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.720
I was assigned to the Oklahoma
City police tactical team


41
00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:53.764
at the time.

42
00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:56.725
And we immediately started
working our way


43
00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:58.436
towards the building.

44
00:02:58.478 --> 00:02:59.728
There were several vehicles

45
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.231
on the north side of the
building in a parking lot,


46
00:03:02.273 --> 00:03:05.443
and all of them were burning.

47
00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:08.488
The black smoke
was billowing up.


48
00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:13.159
When I walked up there,
there was a hole in the ground


49
00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.411
about the size
of a swimming pool


50
00:03:15.453 --> 00:03:17.121
that looked like about 30 feet
in diameter


51
00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:18.665
and about seven,
eight feet deep.


52
00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:20.208
Just a big hole in the ground.

53
00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.627
That's when it started
really sinking in,


54
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.588
this had to be
some kind of bomb.


55
00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:30.926
When I first got there,

56
00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:33.888
I could see people trapped
on different floors,


57
00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.559
and they needed to be rescued.

58
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.854
And so I started my way
into the building.


59
00:03:41.896 --> 00:03:43.231
I thought to myself,

60
00:03:43.272 --> 00:03:44.982
"Why Oklahoma City?

61
00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.693
"It's a quiet place.

62
00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:48.110
"Nothing happens here.

63
00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:51.739
It's not supposed
to happen here."


64
00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.578
Yeah, we'd always had threats.

65
00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.079
You tell somebody,

66
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.706
"I'm sorry, but," you know,

67
00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:01.916
"your claim's denied,"
or whatever,


68
00:04:01.957 --> 00:04:06.588
and, yeah, and we'd get threats,
but not...


69
00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.298
Not anything that we ever
considered, you know, viable.


70
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.883
There has been
a massive explosion


71
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:14.470
at a federal building
in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.


72
00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:15.822
It happened
just a short time ago.


73
00:04:15.846 --> 00:04:17.848
A large portion of that building
has collapsed


74
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.808
and fallen away from the rest
of the building.


75
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.894
At the moment, we don't have
any specific numbers


76
00:04:21.936 --> 00:04:23.646
on injuries or deaths,

77
00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:28.693
but we can tell you that the
situation is obviously serious.


78
00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.529
I tried to put the building
back in my mind,


79
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.615
of, where would he be?

80
00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:38.202
If I have to dig for my son,
where should I dig?


81
00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.870
And so, that's what I did.

82
00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:43.832
I visualized the first floor,
the second floor,


83
00:04:43.874 --> 00:04:46.294
the childcare was here,
his crib would be here,


84
00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:47.920
and that's where I wanted
to get to.


85
00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:52.341
As I started to climb up
the debris and the rubble,


86
00:04:52.383 --> 00:04:53.842
I remember a man yelling,

87
00:04:53.884 --> 00:04:56.095
"You can't go up there,
it's too dangerous!"


88
00:04:56.137 --> 00:05:00.015
And I remember telling him,
"Our babies are in there!


89
00:05:00.057 --> 00:05:02.685
Our babies are in there!"

90
00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:06.188
I just kept saying,
"Our babies are in there."


91
00:05:09.024 --> 00:05:12.861
When I saw the building
for the first time,


92
00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:15.782
I just couldn't see

93
00:05:15.864 --> 00:05:18.867
how anybody could have survived
any of that.


94
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.329
So at that point,
I think my mind was thinking,


95
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.830
"My kids are gone."

96
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:30.838
I drove down there
and met Claudia.


97
00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.048
We walked up to a perimeter

98
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.592
and I asked a officer, I said,

99
00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:36.927
"We have two, two babies
in the daycare center.


100
00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.054
Can I, can I go in?"

101
00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:41.474
Move back, move back, move back.

102
00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:42.891
Move back, move back.

103
00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:44.435
I could see people

104
00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:49.398
that are covered
with blankets, towels, whatever,


105
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.899
that are gone.

106
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:54.028
And I'm praying that one of them
is not a small child.


107
00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:02.911
I knew a lot of the people
in the building.


108
00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:05.707
I knew the D.E.A. agents
that were in the building,


109
00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:08.917
I knew the ATF agents
that were in the building,


110
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:12.672
and those people
were friends of mine.


111
00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:14.923
I could not believe
what had happened to all of them


112
00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:16.258
and how this could be.

113
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.680
How could somebody get
to that state in their life


114
00:06:20.722 --> 00:06:22.973
where they could be
so angry and upset


115
00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.726
that they would do something
like this?


116
00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:35.319
Who started the war?

117
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.821
And who was the aggressor?

118
00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:40.867
That's how I look
at the Murrah bombing.


119
00:06:40.907 --> 00:06:44.078
To me, it wasn't a start
of a war,


120
00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:46.288
it was a counterattack.

121
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.875
The war had already been
started.


122
00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:50.334
You guys think
you can be ruthless?


123
00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:52.919
Let's see how you like it
when the...


124
00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:55.339
when the fight
is brought to you.


125
00:06:55.381 --> 00:07:00.135
If you continue with shit
like Ruby Ridge and Waco,


126
00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:02.137
this is what's going to happen.

127
00:07:18.613 --> 00:07:20.239
Northern Idaho.

128
00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:24.410
It's a remote place, it's
a predominantly white place,


129
00:07:24.452 --> 00:07:26.287
and it's the kind of place

130
00:07:26.328 --> 00:07:31.166
where everybody sort of minds
their own business.


131
00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:36.004
In the 1980s, a lot of extremist
groups found a sanctuary there.


132
00:07:39.508 --> 00:07:40.468
White power!

133
00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:41.469
What do we need?

134
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.011
White power!

135
00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:46.265
One of those groups
was the Aryan Nations.


136
00:07:52.187 --> 00:07:54.022
The Aryan Nations had
established itself


137
00:07:54.064 --> 00:07:58.402
in Hayden Lake as a sort
of headquarters of hate,


138
00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:02.030
radical right-wing hate.

139
00:08:02.072 --> 00:08:04.366
We the white race lost the war.

140
00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:08.036
A plague known as Jews
won the war,


141
00:08:08.078 --> 00:08:10.498
infiltrated our bloodstream
of our race


142
00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:13.668
in every country
in which we reside.


143
00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:19.381
Richard Butler, like many
far-right people at the time,


144
00:08:19.423 --> 00:08:23.636
held that the federal government
was in the hands of the Jews.


145
00:08:23.678 --> 00:08:28.140
And the only way to save America

146
00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:32.019
was to assert
your Christian sovereignty,


147
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.314
your white Christian
sovereignty.


148
00:08:35.356 --> 00:08:39.067
Every major city in the United
States is now non-white,


149
00:08:39.109 --> 00:08:44.072
following the catastrophic
destruction of our race


150
00:08:44.114 --> 00:08:48.076
in the so-called Civil War,
or the War Between the States.


151
00:08:48.118 --> 00:08:53.708
America shall again become
white and Christian.


152
00:08:53.749 --> 00:08:57.920
There'll be a lot of blood
running one day.


153
00:08:57.962 --> 00:09:01.674
I don't advocate it,
I don't want it.


154
00:09:01.716 --> 00:09:03.091
But it's going to come

155
00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:08.639
as sure as day follows night
and night follows day.


156
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.350
In the 1980s, in America,

157
00:09:11.392 --> 00:09:15.103
the white race was becoming
the minority race.


158
00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:18.106
Racist groups used that
as a calling card.


159
00:09:18.148 --> 00:09:20.108
"Come join us,
because the white race


160
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.590
is going to be driven
to extinction."


161
00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:28.075
The Aryan Nations
attracted people


162
00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:32.162
from all walks of life
who were, who were white,


163
00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:38.544
all of them looking for someone
to blame for the situation.


164
00:09:38.586 --> 00:09:42.506
And they focused their anger
on the federal government.


165
00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:47.135
People like Robert Mathews.

166
00:09:47.177 --> 00:09:49.555
Robert Mathews showed up
at the Aryan Nations


167
00:09:49.597 --> 00:09:51.933
in the early 1980s.

168
00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:56.062
And there, he met
other young men like him,


169
00:09:56.103 --> 00:09:58.313
who thought
that it was just talk.


170
00:09:58.355 --> 00:09:59.857
It was no action.

171
00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.359
Bob Mathews said,
"The time has come for action."


172
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:04.820
You Jews get the heck
out of here!


173
00:10:04.862 --> 00:10:07.155
I didn't come all the way
down here to hear you!


174
00:10:07.197 --> 00:10:08.198
Go over there!

175
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.868
...the words of Jesus Christ...

176
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.829
Bob Mathews wanted to start
a revolution.


177
00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:15.247
He saw the United States
government


178
00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:20.461
as a complete and utter enemy,
run by Satanic Jews,


179
00:10:20.502 --> 00:10:25.007
that had to be destroyed.

180
00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:27.843
He had 12 or so other followers,

181
00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:30.763
most of whom he had met
at the Aryan Nations,


182
00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:32.180
and they decided

183
00:10:32.222 --> 00:10:35.851
that they would basically
declare war on the U.S.


184
00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:43.358
As Bob Mathews was formulating
a plan for his organization,


185
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.195
he discovered a book
called The Turner Diaries,


186
00:10:47.237 --> 00:10:51.199
written by a racist
named William Pierce.


187
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:57.205
It was a fictional account
of a group of patriots


188
00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:59.792
that came together
in a very small number,


189
00:10:59.834 --> 00:11:02.086
much like what Bob was planning
to do,


190
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.212
and overthrow
the United States government.


191
00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:10.218
And as Bob read this,
he thought, "This is us.


192
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.221
This is the plan
we need to follow."


193
00:11:13.263 --> 00:11:16.558
"Unit 8 will secure a large
quantity of explosives,


194
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.560
"between five and ten tons.

195
00:11:18.602 --> 00:11:20.104
"We will then drive

196
00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:22.898
"into the FBI building's
freight receiving area,


197
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.275
set the fuse,
and leave the truck."


198
00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:29.071
The Turner Diaries culminates

199
00:11:29.113 --> 00:11:31.281
with these anti-government
resisters


200
00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:36.787
blowing up the FBI headquarters
in Washington, D.C.


201
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:40.248
It had this electrifying,
energizing effect


202
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.208
on all kinds of people
on the radical right.


203
00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:57.265
The Order is a small group,
but a very formidable group,


204
00:11:57.307 --> 00:12:00.519
and they start robbing banks,
armored cars,


205
00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:02.104
kill whoever they had to kill.

206
00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:03.229
They didn't care.

207
00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:13.323
Their expertise grew
week by week and month by month.


208
00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:18.746
This was an organization
that had taken real form


209
00:12:18.787 --> 00:12:22.248
and had real leadership
and direction.


210
00:12:24.418 --> 00:12:27.295
And then they formed
an assassination squad


211
00:12:27.337 --> 00:12:28.714
to go to Denver.

212
00:12:28.756 --> 00:12:31.383
You're listening to Alan Berg
on KOA.


213
00:12:31.425 --> 00:12:32.384
You never shut up!

214
00:12:32.426 --> 00:12:33.677
I got fed up with you!

215
00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:36.346
You never let me get a word
edgewise-- get out of here!


216
00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:40.601
The Jewish talk show host
Alan Berg


217
00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:43.062
had angered the radical right

218
00:12:43.104 --> 00:12:45.564
by essentially mocking them
on his radio show.


219
00:12:45.606 --> 00:12:47.375
If you're not a Christian,
you're un-American.


220
00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.901
Is that your point, sir?

221
00:12:48.943 --> 00:12:50.318
- That's right!
- Good point, sir!


222
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.739
He spoke out
against the right wing


223
00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:56.117
and the Christian Patriot
movement,


224
00:12:56.158 --> 00:12:59.411
yeah, and members
of The Order got fed up.


225
00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:07.920
Alan Berg was shot to death
in the driveway of his home.


226
00:13:07.962 --> 00:13:10.214
It was essentially
domestic terrorism.


227
00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:16.302
It was born-and-bred Americans
inspired by racism,


228
00:13:16.344 --> 00:13:22.350
anti-Semitism,
and anti-government ideology.


229
00:13:22.392 --> 00:13:27.355
The FBI really didn't know
who these individuals were.


230
00:13:27.397 --> 00:13:30.109
But a great break happened
for us


231
00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:32.736
when Bob Mathews decided
they're going to take down


232
00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.320
a Brinks truck that's carrying

233
00:13:34.362 --> 00:13:37.825
multiples of millions
of dollars.


234
00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:39.367
So they do.

235
00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:44.706
A very brazen daylight robbery
right out on a highway.


236
00:13:44.748 --> 00:13:46.374
They take this thing down.

237
00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:49.377
Bob Mathews is in there,
he's clearing out money,


238
00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:52.840
and his pistol falls out
of his waistband.


239
00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:55.176
And we get that pistol.

240
00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:07.021
They convince some members
of The Order to surrender.


241
00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:10.774
But Mathews wouldn't surrender.

242
00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:13.401
And after a two-
or three-day standoff,


243
00:14:13.443 --> 00:14:17.656
the FBI moves in on the cabin
and a gunfight occurs.


244
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:22.036
I'm just a little ways
from the house,


245
00:14:22.077 --> 00:14:23.453
and the bullets are hitting

246
00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:26.790
right at the trees
and the brush line where I'm at.


247
00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:28.375
You know, he's got plenty
of weapons,


248
00:14:28.416 --> 00:14:30.460
he's got thousands of rounds
of ammunition.


249
00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:35.423
He was committed.

250
00:14:35.465 --> 00:14:38.010
The next evening,
it was starting to get dark,


251
00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:40.179
so we put in
some illumination rounds,


252
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:42.597
and those rounds,
one of them or so, caught fire,


253
00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:43.919
and the building started
to burn.


254
00:14:46.434 --> 00:14:48.187
And then it was
like firecrackers,


255
00:14:48.229 --> 00:14:51.439
just pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
going off everywhere,


256
00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:55.610
with the cooking-off
of the rounds.


257
00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:59.614
At daybreak, I walked up
to the remains of the house


258
00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:04.161
and saw a charred body there.

259
00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:07.039
Mathews' death forced
the movement, everybody,


260
00:15:07.081 --> 00:15:08.456
to look at themselves:

261
00:15:08.498 --> 00:15:12.253
"Am I really ready and willing
to die for the cause?"


262
00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:19.467
The FBI was on high alert.

263
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:25.307
I mean, domestic terrorism now
was top order.


264
00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:28.810
And there was a massive amount
of investigation and arrests


265
00:15:28.852 --> 00:15:32.773
throughout the United States.

266
00:15:32.814 --> 00:15:35.150
By the mid-'80s,

267
00:15:35.192 --> 00:15:38.320
the federal agencies had
the lesson of The Order,


268
00:15:38.362 --> 00:15:39.505
so they knew some of the folks

269
00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:41.282
that had come out
of the Aryan Nations


270
00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:42.717
were doing bad things--
they were committing crimes,


271
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.201
they were killing people.

272
00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:47.329
So the Feds were interested in,
who's there,


273
00:15:47.371 --> 00:15:48.580
and what are they doing,

274
00:15:48.622 --> 00:15:50.457
and what are they planning
on doing next?


275
00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:04.888
Randy Weaver was a person
with white separatist beliefs


276
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.517
who moved his family from Iowa
to Boundary County, Idaho,


277
00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:14.022
to a place called Ruby Ridge.

278
00:16:14.064 --> 00:16:18.152
They were 50 miles or so
from the Canadian border.


279
00:16:18.193 --> 00:16:19.320
They had no electricity,

280
00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:21.196
no running water,
no indoor plumbing.


281
00:16:21.238 --> 00:16:22.530
We're talking about a cabin

282
00:16:22.572 --> 00:16:25.909
made by Randy Weaver
and his wife


283
00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:28.620
on a mountaintop.

284
00:16:28.662 --> 00:16:31.665
These are people that want
to be left alone.


285
00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:37.879
The Weavers were deeply
religious


286
00:16:37.921 --> 00:16:39.673
and they wanted to live
in a style


287
00:16:39.714 --> 00:16:44.303
they believed
was Old Testament Christian.


288
00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:46.305
They were really imagining
this fortress,


289
00:16:46.347 --> 00:16:49.975
this place where they could
really separate themselves


290
00:16:50.017 --> 00:16:53.603
from a corrupt
and dangerous world.


291
00:16:57.191 --> 00:16:58.709
I don't know
that Randy Weaver knew


292
00:16:58.733 --> 00:17:01.569
at the time that they moved
to Ruby Ridge


293
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:05.907
that they would be so close
to the Aryan Nations compound,


294
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:09.661
which was just 60 miles south.

295
00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:12.956
But they started showing up.

296
00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.582
At first, it was purely social.

297
00:17:14.624 --> 00:17:18.379
They attended family picnics,
those kinds of things.


298
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.964
But as Randy began
to interact more with them,


299
00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:24.592
he bought into the message,
the anti-government message.


300
00:17:24.634 --> 00:17:28.096
A movement is growing
all over the world.


301
00:17:28.138 --> 00:17:30.640
Good men are coming forth,

302
00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:33.894
men with iron wills

303
00:17:33.935 --> 00:17:37.189
who are determined that their
race is not going to die


304
00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:38.565
and become extinct.

305
00:17:41.318 --> 00:17:45.197
By the time Randy Weaver started
showing up at the Aryan Nations,


306
00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:47.657
it was just after
the whole Matthews episode.


307
00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:51.286
And, unfortunately
for Randy Weaver,


308
00:17:51.328 --> 00:17:53.330
the Feds were listening.

309
00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:56.375
They had lots of events there

310
00:17:56.417 --> 00:17:59.794
designed to potentially recruit
harder-core folks


311
00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:02.005
into the compound,

312
00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:04.632
and it was at one
of those meetings


313
00:18:04.674 --> 00:18:09.888
that Randy Weaver was spotted by
an undercover federal informant.


314
00:18:11.681 --> 00:18:13.559
This guy got next
to Randy Weaver


315
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.478
and learned that he was,
you know, clearly a racist,


316
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.415
that he wanted to live
his white separatist lifestyle


317
00:18:18.439 --> 00:18:19.981
in North Idaho,

318
00:18:20.023 --> 00:18:23.735
but that he was having trouble
putting two nickels together,


319
00:18:23.777 --> 00:18:26.280
and that he was interested
in some income.


320
00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:27.822
And one thing led to another,

321
00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:30.909
and pretty soon, Randy Weaver
agrees to saw off some shotguns.


322
00:18:34.704 --> 00:18:38.417
In my opinion, the ATF pretty
much entrapped him


323
00:18:38.459 --> 00:18:40.627
into making these shotguns
illegal


324
00:18:40.668 --> 00:18:42.921
by cutting off
too much of the barrel,


325
00:18:42.963 --> 00:18:46.674
and then comes out and wants
to arrest him over it.


326
00:18:46.716 --> 00:18:49.677
They figured,
"If we arrest this guy


327
00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:51.638
"on federal firearms charges,

328
00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.307
"maybe he can lead us
to other people


329
00:18:53.348 --> 00:18:54.825
that are doing
more dastardly things."


330
00:18:54.849 --> 00:18:59.938
They did think Randy Weaver
could be flipped.


331
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.690
So they asked him to be
an informant,


332
00:19:02.732 --> 00:19:05.735
which he immediately refused.

333
00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:08.238
Randy Weaver didn't trust
the government


334
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.697
and was absolutely
not interested


335
00:19:09.739 --> 00:19:11.617
in being an informant.

336
00:19:11.658 --> 00:19:14.953
However, he failed to appear
for his next court appearance.


337
00:19:17.331 --> 00:19:18.724
Once you don't show up
for trial,


338
00:19:18.748 --> 00:19:22.377
the case is assigned
to the U.S. Marshals Service.


339
00:19:22.419 --> 00:19:24.212
And the U.S. Marshals Service
doesn't know


340
00:19:24.254 --> 00:19:26.340
whether or not
Randy Weaver was entrapped


341
00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:28.383
or how those shotguns
came about.


342
00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:31.052
They just know
they have a fugitive.


343
00:19:35.682 --> 00:19:38.852
The marshals brought in
their special surveillance team


344
00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:42.063
and they kind of
skunked around the property


345
00:19:42.105 --> 00:19:43.440
trying to find a location

346
00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.001
to take him into custody
without a problem.


347
00:19:45.025 --> 00:19:49.821
Well, this is the approach
from the east.


348
00:19:49.863 --> 00:19:52.491
One of the things
that they decided to do


349
00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:54.535
was to have motion-activated
cameras


350
00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:56.537
placed near the Weaver cabin.

351
00:19:56.578 --> 00:19:59.914
The tapes showed
that Randy Weaver was there


352
00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:04.085
with his wife and his children
and a man named Kevin Harris,


353
00:20:04.127 --> 00:20:07.422
and that they frequently
were armed.


354
00:20:07.464 --> 00:20:09.216
They have to have been
shaking their heads.


355
00:20:09.257 --> 00:20:10.758
"What are we going to do?

356
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.320
"We go up there,
and he's going to shoot at us,


357
00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:13.584
and we're going to shoot back."

358
00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:19.059
On the day of the shooting,

359
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.978
the marshals had a six-man team
they divided into two elements,


360
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.106
and one element of three went up
on the mountain


361
00:20:25.148 --> 00:20:28.776
to have a visual on the cabin
itself.


362
00:20:28.818 --> 00:20:33.532
The other element was on the
ground, closer to the cabin,


363
00:20:33.574 --> 00:20:36.076
when the Weavers' dog caught
the scent of the marshals


364
00:20:36.117 --> 00:20:38.745
and went after them.

365
00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:44.459
All we know at that point was,
there was a shootout.


366
00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:50.298
Who shot who first
is still subject


367
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.217
to, you know, interpretation,

368
00:20:52.259 --> 00:20:54.344
but when it was all said
and done,


369
00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:58.306
14-year-old Sammy Weaver's dead,
the dog's dead,


370
00:20:58.348 --> 00:21:00.808
and so is Federal Marshal
William Degan,


371
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:05.146
killed on the property
of a white separatist.


372
00:21:05.188 --> 00:21:06.856
The FBI had every reason
to think,


373
00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:08.734
when they're dealing
with Randy Weaver,


374
00:21:08.775 --> 00:21:10.777
they could be dealing
with another Bob Mathews.


375
00:21:12.862 --> 00:21:16.199
Because they believe that they
are deploying into a firefight


376
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.159
with a group
of armed separatists


377
00:21:18.201 --> 00:21:20.828
very much like The Order,

378
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.373
the rationale is given
that a surrender warning


379
00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:24.750
doesn't need to be called out,

380
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:26.352
that that warning
has already been given,


381
00:21:26.376 --> 00:21:33.300
so agents can open fire as soon
as they see any armed adult.


382
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:38.513
Well, the Weavers
are always armed.


383
00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:43.769
I got there and there were
trucks and jeeps


384
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.104
and all kinds of vehicles,
you know,


385
00:21:46.146 --> 00:21:50.651
even armored personnel carriers.

386
00:21:50.692 --> 00:21:53.820
It was just overwhelming
how much was happening


387
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:55.181
and how many people
were involved.


388
00:22:01.077 --> 00:22:02.704
Where we were,

389
00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:04.872
at the roadblock,
it was out of view


390
00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:09.127
of where this base operation
was occurring.


391
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:10.878
But there were, you know,

392
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.256
an assortment
of law enforcement people


393
00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:16.718
going across this little bridge.

394
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.721
Neighbors and friends
of Randy Weaver


395
00:22:19.763 --> 00:22:22.140
and reporters
from all over the country


396
00:22:22.182 --> 00:22:25.393
started gathering there,
trying to get information.


397
00:22:25.435 --> 00:22:27.604
If we can tell you something,
we will,


398
00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.499
but most of it will all come out
of Washington, D.C.


399
00:22:29.523 --> 00:22:31.608
We were down
a good two miles or so


400
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.610
from where the actual cabin was.

401
00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:39.157
So we had no clue
as to what the FBI had in mind.


402
00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:45.913
As morning dawns on Ruby Ridge,

403
00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:49.250
a team of ten FBI agents
surround the cabin.


404
00:22:49.292 --> 00:22:52.920
These are snipers who've been
trained to, you know,


405
00:22:52.962 --> 00:22:55.590
to hit a dime from 200 meters.

406
00:22:57.967 --> 00:23:01.304
Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris,
and Sara Weaver


407
00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:04.850
decide they're going to go out
and check on Sam Weaver's body.


408
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.644
They make their way out
with their weapons to the shed


409
00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:10.230
where Samuel has been taken
by the family,


410
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:14.108
when a shot rings out.

411
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.319
Randy is hit in the shoulder.

412
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:22.950
They run back to the house
and another shot rings out.


413
00:23:22.992 --> 00:23:27.913
This shot goes through the door,
hits Vicki Weaver in the face,


414
00:23:27.955 --> 00:23:30.792
splinters,
and wounds Kevin Harris,


415
00:23:30.834 --> 00:23:33.127
and drops Vicki dead
to the floor.


416
00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:40.968
When word came down that Sammy
and Vicki Weaver were dead,


417
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.970
the crowd at the roadblock,

418
00:23:43.012 --> 00:23:46.433
which numbered 50, to 100,
to 200 on occasion,


419
00:23:46.474 --> 00:23:47.474
went crazy.

420
00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:52.522
You call yourself an American?

421
00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:54.691
These are Americans!

422
00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.651
These are God-fearing people!

423
00:23:56.693 --> 00:23:58.087
You don't even know
your Constitution.


424
00:23:58.111 --> 00:24:00.988
Go back and read
what your founding fathers said.


425
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.076
The events at Ruby Ridge lit up
the radical right.


426
00:24:05.118 --> 00:24:08.663
Here was a government that would
murder men, women, and children


427
00:24:08.705 --> 00:24:11.833
in order to pursue whatever
their ends were.


428
00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:13.251
Baby killers!
Baby killers!


429
00:24:13.293 --> 00:24:18.005
The roadblock became
a gathering point


430
00:24:18.047 --> 00:24:21.384
for skinheads,
for Aryan Nations members,


431
00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.386
for all kinds of people,
you know,


432
00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:25.012
furiously shaking their fists

433
00:24:25.054 --> 00:24:27.682
at the Zionist-occupied
government.


434
00:24:27.724 --> 00:24:29.726
You're a disgrace
to the white race!


435
00:24:29.768 --> 00:24:31.812
Disgrace to the race!

436
00:24:31.853 --> 00:24:34.481
This was the first time
the movement had gathered


437
00:24:34.522 --> 00:24:36.023
in such a fashion,

438
00:24:36.065 --> 00:24:39.778
this publicly.

439
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.030
It became a political event
of its own.


440
00:24:43.072 --> 00:24:48.035
These were people who saw
themselves in Randy Weaver.


441
00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:03.050
You look at what happened

442
00:25:03.092 --> 00:25:05.373
and how many times it could have
been averted and avoided.


443
00:25:07.096 --> 00:25:09.766
The idea that the far right had
at that moment


444
00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:12.894
that the government was
a very dangerous entity,


445
00:25:12.936 --> 00:25:17.064
this case would seem to prove it
as completely as possible.


446
00:25:20.777 --> 00:25:22.497
Mr. Weaver, do you have anything
to say?


447
00:25:25.114 --> 00:25:30.119
Ruby Ridge, more even than
Robert Mathews and The Order,


448
00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:35.082
became a central calling card
and rallying card


449
00:25:35.124 --> 00:25:37.042
for the far right.

450
00:25:37.084 --> 00:25:41.756
For them, the government
was after Weaver's guns


451
00:25:41.798 --> 00:25:44.133
and his religion.

452
00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:47.846
And guns and religion became
the twin pillars


453
00:25:47.888 --> 00:25:51.349
of the white supremacist
movement.


454
00:25:53.226 --> 00:25:57.605
In late summer, 1992,
after Ruby Ridge,


455
00:25:57.647 --> 00:26:00.567
several members
of the extremist movement


456
00:26:00.608 --> 00:26:03.110
saw that as an opportune moment

457
00:26:03.152 --> 00:26:05.070
to sort of gather everybody
together


458
00:26:05.112 --> 00:26:06.531
and, "Let's raise hell
about this."


459
00:26:06.573 --> 00:26:11.536
One race, one folk, one nation,
one people, one homeland!


460
00:26:11.578 --> 00:26:13.246
We're going to have it!

461
00:26:13.287 --> 00:26:17.124
Louis Beam, former grand dragon
of the Ku Klux Klan, said,


462
00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:21.922
now is the time for you
as an individual


463
00:26:21.963 --> 00:26:27.134
to commit overt acts
of anti-government violence.


464
00:26:27.176 --> 00:26:30.346
Essentially,
anybody representative


465
00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:32.139
of government or law enforcement

466
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:37.478
was a fair and reasonable
target.


467
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.649
The government is an enemy
of the people.


468
00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:44.652
And in this war,

469
00:26:44.694 --> 00:26:47.154
it's an, it's an all-or-nothing,
you know.


470
00:26:47.196 --> 00:26:50.992
We're either going to win
as the white race


471
00:26:51.034 --> 00:26:54.287
or we're going to lose.

472
00:27:01.044 --> 00:27:02.462
602 to Operations.

473
00:27:02.503 --> 00:27:04.672
The water is shut off
to the federal building.


474
00:27:04.714 --> 00:27:06.800
At this time,
the water is shut off.


475
00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.679
Probably about 10:00
in the morning,


476
00:27:11.721 --> 00:27:14.181
I got a call at the hospital.

477
00:27:14.223 --> 00:27:16.017
There's a lady who's trapped,

478
00:27:16.059 --> 00:27:18.103
and the only way
that we're going to be able


479
00:27:18.143 --> 00:27:19.288
to extricate her
and save her life


480
00:27:19.312 --> 00:27:20.897
is to amputate her leg.

481
00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:26.945
So I got an amputation set,
I got some nylon rope,


482
00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:29.823
and away I went.

483
00:27:29.864 --> 00:27:34.285
When I got to the building,
it was surreal.


484
00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:40.041
There were a lot
of first responders there


485
00:27:40.083 --> 00:27:42.293
who had pretty well
set things up


486
00:27:42.335 --> 00:27:47.548
so they could take somebody away
the minute that they found them.


487
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.927
And then I was led
into the basement.


488
00:27:53.262 --> 00:27:55.222
We could hear people screaming.

489
00:27:55.264 --> 00:27:57.242
We could hear them screaming,
we could hear them crying.


490
00:27:57.266 --> 00:28:01.146
You just couldn't see them
because it was so dark.


491
00:28:01.186 --> 00:28:03.230
When they fired up these lights,

492
00:28:03.272 --> 00:28:06.651
you could see the floors
had fallen on top of each other


493
00:28:06.693 --> 00:28:12.824
and created, like, a dungeon
underneath the Murrah Building.


494
00:28:12.866 --> 00:28:15.451
Everywhere you look
in this floor


495
00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:17.202
that you could see,

496
00:28:17.244 --> 00:28:20.915
there were these round circles
of coagulated blood


497
00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:23.543
that were coming
through the cracks of the floor.


498
00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:27.254
These circles were three
and four feet in diameter,


499
00:28:27.296 --> 00:28:30.257
and they're everywhere,
seemed like everywhere,


500
00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:33.344
and you knew that that was
a person that had been crushed.


501
00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:40.267
They led me to where Daina
was trapped.


502
00:28:40.309 --> 00:28:44.355
There was a first responder
with his hand on the beam


503
00:28:44.397 --> 00:28:46.191
that had her leg trapped.

504
00:28:46.232 --> 00:28:50.737
And if it trembled or moved,
we were told we had to go.


505
00:28:50.778 --> 00:28:55.909
The beam was lying on her leg,
her tibia, just below the knee.


506
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.912
Basically, to do the amputation,

507
00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:03.041
I had to lie with my legs
up by her head.


508
00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:06.044
And so I took the traction rope
and tightened it down


509
00:29:06.086 --> 00:29:08.838
so that I had a tourniquet.

510
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.674
And then, you know, it's kind
of like diving into ice water.


511
00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.427
I had to start.

512
00:29:14.468 --> 00:29:15.636
Get back!

513
00:29:15.678 --> 00:29:16.637
Go, go!

514
00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:17.722
Get them back!

515
00:29:17.764 --> 00:29:20.225
Get them back!

516
00:29:20.266 --> 00:29:25.063
Just as I got
to where the barricade was,


517
00:29:25.105 --> 00:29:28.649
this incredible scare went
through the crowd.


518
00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:30.110
Get your stuff back now!

519
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:31.611
Someone was yelling they thought

520
00:29:31.652 --> 00:29:34.155
they had discovered a second
bomb: "Get back, get back!"


521
00:29:34.197 --> 00:29:36.991
We've got a hot device--
get them back!


522
00:29:37.033 --> 00:29:38.534
They start screaming at us.

523
00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:42.080
"Get out of this building, we
have just found another device!"


524
00:29:42.122 --> 00:29:44.874
And of course,
everybody's heart sinks,


525
00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.676
because we've got people
still alive in here.


526
00:29:48.628 --> 00:29:51.338
I was on the eighth floor.

527
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.508
My eyes were
in pretty bad shape.


528
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:58.345
Two of my friends
worked their way over to me,


529
00:29:58.387 --> 00:30:02.058
and said, "We've got to get out
of here."


530
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.851
I was praying, I was saying,

531
00:30:03.893 --> 00:30:06.312
"Lord, don't let there be
any more bombs."


532
00:30:08.148 --> 00:30:11.358
It turns out that it was not
a real device.


533
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.362
It had been a mockup
for one of the agencies there.


534
00:30:15.404 --> 00:30:18.365
But we were still telling
people, you know,


535
00:30:18.407 --> 00:30:20.493
that we couldn't guarantee
their safety


536
00:30:20.534 --> 00:30:21.534
as they went in there.

537
00:30:23.997 --> 00:30:27.374
I remember seeing that team
down there


538
00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:31.171
working on that girl
to amputate that leg.


539
00:30:31.212 --> 00:30:32.856
Everybody's screaming at them,
"Get out of there!


540
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.399
Get out of there,
the bomb's going to..."


541
00:30:34.423 --> 00:30:37.093
And they would not leave,
they would not leave her.


542
00:30:39.053 --> 00:30:40.405
I don't remember how many times

543
00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:43.308
I thought I had completed
the amputation.


544
00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:47.520
We would try to extract Daina
and she was still caught.


545
00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:50.397
I reached a point where
all of the blades were broken


546
00:30:50.439 --> 00:30:52.025
and there was nothing else
to do,


547
00:30:52.066 --> 00:30:55.028
but I had in my pocket
a pocketknife


548
00:30:55.069 --> 00:30:57.238
that I keep very sharp.

549
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.966
The thing that was
keeping us from extracting her


550
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.616
was the quadriceps tendon,

551
00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.327
and once I cut through that,

552
00:31:02.368 --> 00:31:04.954
then I could kind of get a sense
that the leg was free


553
00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:07.373
and we were able to extract her.

554
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.727
We have two critical patients.

555
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:14.297
I have one patient that needs
immediate transport...


556
00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:17.633
When I got out of the building,

557
00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:20.887
I sat on the curb
waiting for an ambulance.


558
00:31:20.928 --> 00:31:23.014
I couldn't see anything,

559
00:31:23.056 --> 00:31:25.892
but I could hear people yelling,
people screaming,


560
00:31:25.933 --> 00:31:30.437
sirens in the background.

561
00:31:30.479 --> 00:31:34.192
And I thought,
"What crazy person did this?


562
00:31:34.234 --> 00:31:39.280
Who has come in here and done
this terrible thing?"


563
00:31:43.576 --> 00:31:46.453
The bombing in Oklahoma City

564
00:31:46.495 --> 00:31:49.249
was an attack
on innocent children


565
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:53.044
and defenseless citizens.

566
00:31:53.086 --> 00:31:58.091
It was an act of cowardice
and it was evil.


567
00:31:58.132 --> 00:32:01.261
Let there be no room for doubt,

568
00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:04.389
we will find the people
who did this.


569
00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:08.535
The bombing
of the Murrah Building


570
00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:10.477
was the largest domestic
terrorist event


571
00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:14.481
that had ever occurred
in the United States.


572
00:32:14.523 --> 00:32:16.901
We probably had
close to 500 investigators


573
00:32:16.943 --> 00:32:20.113
that were here in Oklahoma City.

574
00:32:20.154 --> 00:32:25.034
We had forensic teams,
bomb squad teams,


575
00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:29.330
evidence response teams,
all kinds of experts,


576
00:32:29.372 --> 00:32:31.457
looking for clues.

577
00:32:31.498 --> 00:32:36.296
This becomes one of the biggest
criminal investigations


578
00:32:36.337 --> 00:32:37.880
in American history.

579
00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:42.176
Every police agency
in the country


580
00:32:42.218 --> 00:32:47.514
is in some way trying
to track down leads,


581
00:32:47.556 --> 00:32:51.894
because at the very first,
they had no idea who did it.


582
00:32:53.938 --> 00:32:55.522
FBI Hotline.

583
00:32:55.564 --> 00:33:00.236
We have had hundreds,
if not thousands of leads.


584
00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:03.572
Each one of those is treated
very seriously.


585
00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:05.532
But at this point,
we cannot speculate


586
00:33:05.574 --> 00:33:08.328
with regard
to who is responsible.


587
00:33:08.369 --> 00:33:11.914
We ended up with leads
in literally every state,


588
00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.540
as well as many
foreign countries.


589
00:33:13.582 --> 00:33:16.752
Whenever you have
a mass catastrophe,


590
00:33:16.794 --> 00:33:18.296
such as the Murrah bombing,

591
00:33:18.338 --> 00:33:19.588
the assumption is always,

592
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.548
"You've got to have
this great conspiracy.


593
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.635
There've got to be
multiple people involved."


594
00:33:24.677 --> 00:33:28.389
And we operated
under that assumption, as well.


595
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:31.558
We were getting calls, even
just after the bombing happened.


596
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.354
We were getting reports
by the thousands,


597
00:33:34.395 --> 00:33:37.315
that, "I saw this, I saw that."

598
00:33:37.357 --> 00:33:39.859
Then we started getting calls
over the radio


599
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.152
about Middle Easterners.

600
00:33:41.194 --> 00:33:42.695
"Start looking
for Middle Easterners."


601
00:33:42.736 --> 00:33:47.492
There has yet been no claim of
responsibility for this bombing,


602
00:33:47.574 --> 00:33:49.576
although if you talk
to intelligence sources


603
00:33:49.618 --> 00:33:51.245
and to law enforcement
officials,


604
00:33:51.287 --> 00:33:53.580
they all say
in their early guess


605
00:33:53.622 --> 00:33:54.874
in this situation

606
00:33:54.915 --> 00:33:56.250
is that this particular bombing

607
00:33:56.292 --> 00:33:58.419
probably has roots
in the Middle East.


608
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:00.754
A U.S. government source
has told CBS News


609
00:34:00.796 --> 00:34:04.217
that it has Middle East
terrorism written all over it.


610
00:34:04.258 --> 00:34:07.136
I started making phone calls,

611
00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:08.637
trying to find out
what was going on


612
00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.098
and very quickly found out
that the Feds went


613
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.600
and raided an apartment
in Dallas


614
00:34:13.642 --> 00:34:17.604
that was occupied
by some Middle Eastern guys.


615
00:34:17.646 --> 00:34:19.606
But then someone I spoke to
said,


616
00:34:19.648 --> 00:34:21.984
"Do you know what day it is?"

617
00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:23.569
I said, you know, "What?"

618
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.612
I had been off work
for a couple of days,


619
00:34:25.654 --> 00:34:27.614
and so, you know,

620
00:34:27.656 --> 00:34:29.634
wasn't paying attention
to the calendar that closely.


621
00:34:29.658 --> 00:34:31.869
And someone said,
"It's April 19."


622
00:34:31.911 --> 00:34:35.622
Immediately it hit me.

623
00:34:35.664 --> 00:34:38.334
This is about Waco.

624
00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:40.545
You know, this is about Waco.

625
00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:52.639
♪ Give me that
old-time religion ♪


626
00:34:52.681 --> 00:34:56.394
♪ Give me that
old-time religion ♪


627
00:34:56.436 --> 00:34:58.854
♪ Give me that
old-time religion ♪


628
00:34:58.896 --> 00:35:01.857
♪ It's good enough for me! ♪

629
00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:04.651
The Branch Davidians
had been in Texas


630
00:35:04.693 --> 00:35:05.819
for over 50 years

631
00:35:05.861 --> 00:35:08.489
by the time that most people
outside of Waco


632
00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:09.532
had ever heard of them.

633
00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:12.118
They were an offshoot

634
00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:14.661
of the Seventh-day
Adventist Church.


635
00:35:14.703 --> 00:35:19.041
They found a place just outside
of Waco, called it Mt. Carmel,


636
00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:21.502
and set up this community.

637
00:35:24.004 --> 00:35:26.048
In the late '80s,

638
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.967
a young Davidian
named Vernon Howell


639
00:35:28.008 --> 00:35:29.469
had a revelation

640
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.388
that God had chosen him
to be their leader.


641
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.558
He changed his name
to David Koresh


642
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.936
and began preaching
his vision of Armageddon


643
00:35:38.978 --> 00:35:40.687
out of the Book of Revelation.

644
00:35:40.729 --> 00:35:42.583
"So how's God going to talk
to me in the latter days?"


645
00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:43.708
It's going to be written.

646
00:35:43.732 --> 00:35:45.092
And who's going to bring
that book?


647
00:35:45.985 --> 00:35:47.069
So there'll be no excuses!

648
00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:51.031
In about May of 1992,

649
00:35:51.073 --> 00:35:53.618
the sheriff's department in Waco

650
00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:56.412
got a report
from a U.P.S. truck driver


651
00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:59.665
about a shipment going
to Mt. Carmel.


652
00:35:59.706 --> 00:36:01.792
There was a box that fell apart,

653
00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:05.712
and some pineapple grenade hulls
came out of the box.


654
00:36:05.754 --> 00:36:07.465
That's what prompted

655
00:36:07.507 --> 00:36:10.551
the beginning
of the ATF investigation.


656
00:36:10.593 --> 00:36:12.719
That investigation was able
to determine


657
00:36:12.761 --> 00:36:14.930
that they were illegally
converting automatic weapons


658
00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:16.516
in there,

659
00:36:16.557 --> 00:36:20.686
that they had purchased
about $43,000 worth of firearms


660
00:36:20.727 --> 00:36:22.438
during the year prior to it,

661
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.358
and members of the community
out there


662
00:36:25.399 --> 00:36:27.901
had heard automatic weapons fire
and explosions


663
00:36:27.943 --> 00:36:30.737
coming from the compound.

664
00:36:30.779 --> 00:36:33.740
Koresh preached increasingly

665
00:36:33.782 --> 00:36:37.161
that they were going to be met
with an opposing force.


666
00:36:37.203 --> 00:36:39.205
So when we start getting
into the subject


667
00:36:39.246 --> 00:36:40.414
of the Seven Seals,

668
00:36:40.456 --> 00:36:41.766
looks like somebody's
going to get


669
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.250
a butt-whuppin'
in the near future,


670
00:36:43.292 --> 00:36:44.544
aren't they?

671
00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:46.587
He believed that the government

672
00:36:46.629 --> 00:36:49.340
was going to try to invade
this sacred ground


673
00:36:49.382 --> 00:36:51.758
that was Mt. Carmel.

674
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.762
And so, this actually would be
where Armageddon takes place.


675
00:36:55.804 --> 00:36:57.973
People in ATF felt

676
00:36:58.015 --> 00:37:02.603
that if this Armageddon that
he predicted didn't come true,


677
00:37:02.645 --> 00:37:04.771
he was going to have to do
something to prompt it.


678
00:37:04.813 --> 00:37:09.735
So we decided that we needed
to act as quickly as possible.


679
00:37:14.448 --> 00:37:16.701
Reporters for the Waco
Tribune-Herald


680
00:37:16.783 --> 00:37:20.204
had really good sources
in local law enforcement,


681
00:37:20.246 --> 00:37:21.664
and they had been tipped

682
00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:24.667
about when the raid
was going to go down.


683
00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:28.003
This road's going to be
closed soon.


684
00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:30.506
The morning of the raid,

685
00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:33.217
a reporter was sent
to the compound,


686
00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:34.719
and he's driving around

687
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.803
trying to figure out
where he is,


688
00:37:36.845 --> 00:37:39.806
when here comes
a Buick station wagon,


689
00:37:39.848 --> 00:37:41.308
stops, rolls down the window,

690
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.851
says, "Hey, buddy,
are you lost?"


691
00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:47.398
He says, "Yeah, I'm looking
for Mt. Carmel.


692
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.526
There's going to be a big raid."

693
00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:53.112
Turns out that the guy
in the car


694
00:37:53.153 --> 00:37:57.283
is one of the inner circle
of Koresh's followers.


695
00:37:57.324 --> 00:37:59.826
He immediately goes
and tells Koresh


696
00:37:59.868 --> 00:38:02.121
what was happening.

697
00:38:02.162 --> 00:38:03.497
That morning,

698
00:38:03.539 --> 00:38:06.751
David said
that we had information


699
00:38:06.792 --> 00:38:09.128
that there was going
to be a raid today.


700
00:38:10.879 --> 00:38:13.799
The men were arming themselves
and the women were told


701
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.554
to go back to their rooms
and bunker down.


702
00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:21.014
We were going to be confronting

703
00:38:21.056 --> 00:38:23.559
on a very large compound.

704
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:26.061
They had 45 minutes
to prepare for us


705
00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:29.774
and began firing on us
as soon as we got there.


706
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.363
I heard an M60 machine gun
being fired.


707
00:38:36.405 --> 00:38:40.367
Then I heard the A.K.-47s.

708
00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:42.369
And then I heard
the 50-calibers,


709
00:38:42.411 --> 00:38:45.372
just a brutal, brutal weapon.

710
00:38:48.917 --> 00:38:51.920
There's no doubt these people
were trying to kill us.


711
00:38:54.923 --> 00:38:57.718
The firefight went on
for 2 1/2 hours.


712
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.681
And when they finally agreed
to a ceasefire,


713
00:39:01.722 --> 00:39:05.476
we were able to get our people
and get out.


714
00:39:05.518 --> 00:39:06.477
Yeah, this is Lynch.

715
00:39:06.519 --> 00:39:07.478
Hey, Lynch?

716
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.979
Yeah.

717
00:39:09.021 --> 00:39:10.499
That's kind of
a funny name there.


718
00:39:10.523 --> 00:39:11.857
Now, listen, now...

719
00:39:11.898 --> 00:39:12.917
Now, who am I speaking with?

720
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:14.109
This is David Koresh.

721
00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:15.110
Okay, David.

722
00:39:15.152 --> 00:39:16.320
The notorious.

723
00:39:16.362 --> 00:39:18.155
What'd you guys do that for?

724
00:39:18.197 --> 00:39:21.950
Well, David, what, this,
what I'm doing is,


725
00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:24.286
I'm trying to establish some
communication links with you.


726
00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.347
No, no, no, no, no.

727
00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:26.330
Let me tell you something.

728
00:39:26.372 --> 00:39:27.498
Yes, sir.

729
00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.708
You see, you brought

730
00:39:28.749 --> 00:39:29.916
a bunch of guys out here

731
00:39:29.958 --> 00:39:31.918
and you killed
some of my children.


732
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.546
We told you we wanted to talk.

733
00:39:33.587 --> 00:39:35.106
How come you guys had
to be ATF agents?


734
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.508
How come you try to be so big
all the time?


735
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.009
Okay, David...

736
00:39:39.051 --> 00:39:40.720
Now there's a bunch
of us dead.


737
00:39:40.761 --> 00:39:42.095
There's a bunch
of you guys dead.


738
00:39:42.137 --> 00:39:43.930
Now, now that's your fault.

739
00:39:43.972 --> 00:39:45.932
Okay, let's, let's try
to resolve this now.


740
00:39:45.974 --> 00:39:48.935
Tell me this,
now, you have casualties.


741
00:39:48.977 --> 00:39:50.396
How many casualties?

742
00:39:50.437 --> 00:39:52.147
Do you want to try
to work something out?


743
00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:56.026
ATF is pulling back,
we're trying to, uh...


744
00:39:56.068 --> 00:39:58.945
Why didn't you do that first?

745
00:39:58.987 --> 00:40:04.702
By the end of this shootout,
four ATF agents were dead,


746
00:40:04.744 --> 00:40:06.453
more than a dozen were wounded.

747
00:40:06.495 --> 00:40:10.541
And inside, five Davidians
were dead


748
00:40:10.583 --> 00:40:12.251
and David Koresh was wounded.

749
00:40:12.292 --> 00:40:14.002
Okay, then, move out.

750
00:40:16.505 --> 00:40:21.635
There really wasn't much
organization as to how we left.


751
00:40:21.677 --> 00:40:23.387
The three team leaders,
all of us,


752
00:40:23.429 --> 00:40:25.890
were wounded very badly.

753
00:40:25.931 --> 00:40:31.604
I was actually put in a blanket
and placed on the hood of a car,


754
00:40:31.645 --> 00:40:34.189
and, uh...

755
00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:38.985
I don't remember anything about
the... the trip out, actually.


756
00:40:41.029 --> 00:40:44.366
American law enforcement had
never seen anything like this.


757
00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:47.286
They had never had
this kind of loss.


758
00:40:47.327 --> 00:40:53.333
They had never been met
with this kind of resistance.


759
00:40:53.375 --> 00:40:55.502
There was shock,
there was anger,


760
00:40:55.544 --> 00:41:00.090
and there was uncertainty.

761
00:41:00.132 --> 00:41:02.175
Tragedy tonight in Waco, Texas.

762
00:41:02.217 --> 00:41:05.053
At least four federal agents
and a member of a cult group


763
00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:09.015
are dead after an hour-long
gun battle at the cult's ranch.


764
00:41:09.057 --> 00:41:11.351
14 other agents were
wounded in the shootout


765
00:41:11.393 --> 00:41:14.271
that started when law officers
tried to enter the compound.


766
00:41:16.148 --> 00:41:18.734
David Koresh, pick up
the phone.


767
00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:21.821
The negotiators
want to speak with you.


768
00:41:21.862 --> 00:41:23.047
The tactic
from the very beginning


769
00:41:23.071 --> 00:41:26.700
was trying to negotiate
a resolution.


770
00:41:26.742 --> 00:41:29.954
We were willing to spend
as long as possible


771
00:41:29.995 --> 00:41:31.246
to try to get the people out.

772
00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:35.041
And particularly,
we would focus on the children,


773
00:41:35.083 --> 00:41:39.505
trying to get the children
out of there.


774
00:41:39.546 --> 00:41:43.133
And starting off the evening
of the 28th of February,


775
00:41:43.175 --> 00:41:44.343
we were successful.

776
00:41:44.384 --> 00:41:48.555
We were starting
to get kids out.


777
00:41:48.597 --> 00:41:51.517
But we couldn't fathom
how in the world


778
00:41:51.558 --> 00:41:55.729
these parents were so latched
onto David


779
00:41:55.771 --> 00:41:58.315
that they would abandon
their children.


780
00:42:01.276 --> 00:42:02.820
We took videotapes of them

781
00:42:02.862 --> 00:42:04.780
playing on the,
on the swing set,


782
00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.824
and eating ice cream,

783
00:42:06.866 --> 00:42:09.785
and just communing
with one another,


784
00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:14.790
and we sent them back
into the compound.


785
00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.792
We wanted
to do something tangible


786
00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:18.311
so their parents could think,
you know,


787
00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:22.673
"Maybe I need to come out
and reassume my responsibility


788
00:42:22.715 --> 00:42:24.466
as a parent."

789
00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:30.096
I didn't decide
to send my kids out.


790
00:42:30.138 --> 00:42:34.768
My kids leaving
was part of the prophecy.


791
00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.230
I didn't know when it was going
to happen,


792
00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:40.983
but I knew it would happen.

793
00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.359
They weren't David's children.

794
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.071
He let children go

795
00:42:46.112 --> 00:42:48.365
up until there were
no children left in there


796
00:42:48.407 --> 00:42:49.992
except his children.

797
00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:52.160
And he told us,
"This is the last one.


798
00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:53.328
The rest are mine."

799
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.841
The negotiators needed
a different way


800
00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.134
to approach the situation.

801
00:43:08.176 --> 00:43:13.265
And so it was proposed to Koresh
that he make a recording


802
00:43:13.306 --> 00:43:14.767
that could be broadcast

803
00:43:14.808 --> 00:43:17.143
to bring his message
to the world,


804
00:43:17.185 --> 00:43:20.230
if he would agree
to lead his people out.


805
00:43:20.272 --> 00:43:23.609
Koresh agreed to do this.

806
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:24.944
Okay, here we go.

807
00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:27.362
We're going to the tape
of David Koresh.


808
00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:30.741
It's March 2, 1993.

809
00:43:30.783 --> 00:43:33.159
My name is Dave Koresh.

810
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:37.163
I'm speaking to you
from Mt. Carmel Center.


811
00:43:37.205 --> 00:43:40.918
In the Book of Revelation,
commentary states


812
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.129
that what John has written
in Scripture


813
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:47.925
is nothing other than
the revelation of Jesus Christ,


814
00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:52.178
which God gave to Him
to show to His servants


815
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.724
things which must shortly
come to pass...


816
00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:57.935
They're bringing in buses.

817
00:43:57.977 --> 00:44:00.186
They're bringing in
all sorts of people


818
00:44:00.228 --> 00:44:01.939
who are going to help process
the folks


819
00:44:01.981 --> 00:44:03.941
coming out of the compound.

820
00:44:03.983 --> 00:44:07.152
They were convinced
that he was going to come out.


821
00:44:09.195 --> 00:44:10.864
We were at such a high level,

822
00:44:10.906 --> 00:44:14.367
thinking that this thing
was going to end.


823
00:44:14.409 --> 00:44:17.162
We were high-fiving each other,

824
00:44:17.203 --> 00:44:19.873
then all of a sudden,
everything just stopped.


825
00:44:19.915 --> 00:44:25.629
We were told that David received
a message from God


826
00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:27.547
telling them to wait.

827
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:28.966
You went back on your word.

828
00:44:29.008 --> 00:44:30.134
That is a lie!

829
00:44:30.175 --> 00:44:31.135
That is not a lie.

830
00:44:31.176 --> 00:44:33.012
That is a lie!

831
00:44:33.053 --> 00:44:34.471
You will find out
in the Judgment...


832
00:44:34.513 --> 00:44:36.181
You know as well as I do

833
00:44:36.222 --> 00:44:38.224
that your challenge
to open these Seven Seals,


834
00:44:38.266 --> 00:44:40.435
it's garbage, it's a false
hope, and you know this.


835
00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:42.187
No, it's not.

836
00:44:42.228 --> 00:44:44.064
Once he didn't come out,

837
00:44:44.106 --> 00:44:47.233
the FBI's tactics pretty quickly
became aggressive.


838
00:44:47.275 --> 00:44:50.863
The power was cut.

839
00:44:50.904 --> 00:44:54.282
They blasted lights
at the compound.


840
00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:57.285
They had brought in tanks,

841
00:44:57.327 --> 00:45:02.415
so they drove
over Koresh's prized cars.


842
00:45:02.457 --> 00:45:07.963
They also set up loudspeakers
and they began blasting


843
00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:11.215
Nancy Sinatra's "These
Boots Are Made for Walking."


844
00:45:11.257 --> 00:45:14.302
♪ One of these days these boots
are gonna walk all over you. ♪


845
00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:18.182
Christmas carols,
the sounds of dying rabbits,


846
00:45:18.222 --> 00:45:23.729
phones off the hook,
and even Tibetan monk chants.


847
00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.065
It was clear
that the FBI was saying,


848
00:45:26.106 --> 00:45:30.234
"Hey, we're going to show you
who's boss."


849
00:45:30.276 --> 00:45:32.905
The standoff outside
the Branch Davidian compound


850
00:45:32.946 --> 00:45:35.281
has become a psychological
power struggle.


851
00:45:35.323 --> 00:45:38.911
Now, sources tell CBS News
that federal agents don't plan


852
00:45:38.952 --> 00:45:40.662
to let this go on indefinitely,

853
00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:42.956
their frustration level
is very high,


854
00:45:42.998 --> 00:45:45.291
and if negotiations
are not more fruitful,


855
00:45:45.333 --> 00:45:47.377
they may take action
by this weekend.


856
00:45:47.419 --> 00:45:48.879
Dan?

857
00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:51.297
The story kept growing
and growing.


858
00:45:51.339 --> 00:45:56.178
And the press initially
was very supportive


859
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.470
of what we were doing,

860
00:45:57.512 --> 00:45:58.764
and very understanding,

861
00:45:58.805 --> 00:46:01.307
but as the days went on,

862
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:03.435
they started becoming
more demanding.


863
00:46:03.476 --> 00:46:07.647
They were saying, "After all,
they've killed four ATF agents.


864
00:46:07.689 --> 00:46:12.318
Why are you just sitting back
and letting them do this?"


865
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.196
We are not going
to be jerked around.


866
00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:17.449
We will take whatever action
is necessary to get it resolved.


867
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.326
And again, our ultimate goal
from day one


868
00:46:20.368 --> 00:46:22.746
is to get it resolved
peacefully.


869
00:46:22.788 --> 00:46:26.125
It was probably the number-one
story in the United States,


870
00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:28.961
and many of the right-wing
Patriot types


871
00:46:29.002 --> 00:46:30.336
started showing up, as well.

872
00:46:30.378 --> 00:46:35.884
They thought this was
only about seizing guns,


873
00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:38.053
about ATF attacking a church

874
00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:41.723
because they believed
in possessing guns.


875
00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:45.060
They didn't manage to get
into the press conferences,


876
00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:48.147
but somebody else did.

877
00:46:48.188 --> 00:46:50.190
Louis Beam, the white
supremacist


878
00:46:50.232 --> 00:46:51.775
and former Klan leader,

879
00:46:51.817 --> 00:46:56.071
showed up and presented himself
as a credentialed reporter.


880
00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:58.698
Are we seeing the emergence
of a police state


881
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.324
in The United States?

882
00:47:00.366 --> 00:47:02.577
We figured out who he was
pretty quickly.


883
00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:06.414
He'd previously been on the
FBI's top ten most wanted list.


884
00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:09.375
And I asked them if they're
going to have a police state,


885
00:47:09.417 --> 00:47:12.212
and, uh, they don't want
to hear about police state,


886
00:47:12.254 --> 00:47:16.800
ATF black-booted, black-suited,
black-helmeted troopers


887
00:47:16.842 --> 00:47:18.384
carrying guns,
assaulting people.


888
00:47:18.426 --> 00:47:20.344
Mr. Beam?
Let me see this...


889
00:47:20.386 --> 00:47:25.391
White supremacists, like Beam,
saw in this standoff


890
00:47:25.433 --> 00:47:28.603
the same issues that they
had decided were important


891
00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.189
with Randy Weaver.

892
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:34.901
The Branch Davidians
were not white supremacists.


893
00:47:34.943 --> 00:47:37.403
But now a broader section
of the far right


894
00:47:37.445 --> 00:47:40.157
sees itself in Waco, and says,

895
00:47:40.199 --> 00:47:44.119
"We're being suppressed
for our beliefs and our guns."


896
00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:46.830
Up to the top of the hill,
them two white...


897
00:47:46.872 --> 00:47:48.498
Little white buildings
up there.


898
00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:54.420
There was a hill that was about
three miles from Mt. Carmel.


899
00:47:54.462 --> 00:47:56.464
It was on a rise
that was high enough


900
00:47:56.506 --> 00:48:01.385
that you could just barely see
Mt. Carmel in the distance.


901
00:48:01.427 --> 00:48:03.680
This was as close
as members of the public


902
00:48:03.722 --> 00:48:07.142
could get to the standoff.

903
00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:09.019
You're next, you're next!

904
00:48:09.061 --> 00:48:10.603
Wake up and understand!

905
00:48:10.645 --> 00:48:12.314
You're next!

906
00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:15.901
All sorts of folks felt moved
to come down


907
00:48:15.942 --> 00:48:18.153
to see what was going on
at Waco.


908
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:30.916
Just, just arrived today.

909
00:48:30.957 --> 00:48:32.458
Just, somebody told me

910
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.978
a lot of people are scared
to put something on,


911
00:48:34.002 --> 00:48:35.087
you know, like this.

912
00:48:35.128 --> 00:48:37.463
Timothy McVeigh

913
00:48:37.505 --> 00:48:40.466
had already apparently
been very concerned


914
00:48:40.508 --> 00:48:43.469
about what had happened
at Ruby Ridge.


915
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:46.765
So he came down to Waco

916
00:48:46.806 --> 00:48:48.474
and sold bumper stickers

917
00:48:48.516 --> 00:48:54.064
with pro-gun, anti-government
slogans.


918
00:48:54.106 --> 00:48:57.441
He saw the raid
as clear evidence


919
00:48:57.483 --> 00:48:59.485
of what the government would do

920
00:48:59.527 --> 00:49:03.698
to try to confiscate guns
and persecute gun owners.


921
00:49:05.533 --> 00:49:08.494
Tim McVeigh loved guns.

922
00:49:08.536 --> 00:49:10.496
When he was a kid,

923
00:49:10.538 --> 00:49:13.833
his grandfather taught him
all about guns:


924
00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:18.588
the safe handling of guns
and the rights of gun owners.


925
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.301
They would go out
and shoot together,


926
00:49:22.342 --> 00:49:24.928
go to target practice.

927
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.389
He just loved guns,

928
00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:31.475
and the whole belief
about a man owning guns.


929
00:49:33.728 --> 00:49:38.191
Pendleton, New York,
was white suburbia.


930
00:49:38.233 --> 00:49:40.277
It's near Buffalo.

931
00:49:40.319 --> 00:49:44.572
It's where generations
of the McVeigh family had lived.


932
00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:46.074
Growing up,

933
00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:47.533
Tim loved superheroes.

934
00:49:47.575 --> 00:49:50.245
He had a huge comic book
collection,


935
00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:53.915
he liked Soldier of Fortune
magazine,


936
00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:56.668
and he hated bullies.

937
00:49:56.709 --> 00:50:00.546
Tim was very skinny and tall,

938
00:50:00.588 --> 00:50:05.551
and in high school, he was known
as "Noodle" McVeigh.


939
00:50:05.593 --> 00:50:10.890
That was the beginning
of a lifelong hatred of bullies.


940
00:50:12.684 --> 00:50:16.562
After high school,
he went into the Army.


941
00:50:16.604 --> 00:50:22.194
He just couldn't seem to
find the right path to a career.


942
00:50:22.235 --> 00:50:26.281
But the other reason
was he loved guns.


943
00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:28.616
It gave him access
to all kinds of guns


944
00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:33.955
and other weapons and he was
like a kid in a candy store.


945
00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:37.583
I was an admitted gun enthusiast
and so you can't go wrong


946
00:50:37.625 --> 00:50:39.127
both brushing up your skills

947
00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:41.629
and, hell, the Army
is free ammunition.


948
00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.298
So I wanted to get out

949
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.258
and experience
the rest of the world.


950
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.636
I wanted to get out of my
isolation of Pendleton.


951
00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:55.601
The Army provided Tim McVeigh
with a place where he fit in.


952
00:50:55.643 --> 00:51:00.606
He was the top gun at Fort Riley
in his Bradley fighting vehicle.


953
00:51:00.648 --> 00:51:05.487
His supervisors took
notice of him.


954
00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:08.614
He was a leader in the Army.

955
00:51:08.656 --> 00:51:13.577
And then he goes over to Iraq
for the first Gulf War.


956
00:51:15.663 --> 00:51:18.624
It was in the war that McVeigh
first started


957
00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:22.128
to become disillusioned
with the military


958
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.923
and the United States
government.


959
00:51:24.964 --> 00:51:29.635
When he killed Iraqi soldiers,

960
00:51:29.677 --> 00:51:33.390
he didn't feel the exhilaration
that he thought he would.


961
00:51:34.682 --> 00:51:37.810
He took a very, very long
sniper shot


962
00:51:37.852 --> 00:51:39.812
and killed an Iraqi soldier.

963
00:51:39.854 --> 00:51:42.690
And he describes seeing
this man's head explode.


964
00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:48.238
And he could not see
the reason for it.


965
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.531
He could not really understand

966
00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:51.866
what the United States
was doing there.


967
00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:54.119
My overall experience
in the Gulf War


968
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.663
taught me that these people were
just that, they were people.


969
00:51:57.705 --> 00:52:00.208
They were human beings
at the core,


970
00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.667
they were no different than me.

971
00:52:01.709 --> 00:52:04.212
Then I had to reconcile that
with the fact


972
00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:08.216
that, well, I killed them.

973
00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:11.635
He's truly conflicted.

974
00:52:11.677 --> 00:52:14.931
He sees the American government
as a bully.


975
00:52:16.724 --> 00:52:21.605
But they summon him home for
ranger school, special forces.


976
00:52:21.645 --> 00:52:25.775
And he was willing to put aside
his anti-government views


977
00:52:25.817 --> 00:52:31.364
in order to become, you know,
the ultimate soldier.


978
00:52:31.406 --> 00:52:34.159
But he's not in top-notch
physical shape


979
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:39.331
and, to his embarrassment,
washes out of rangers school.


980
00:52:39.372 --> 00:52:43.709
And the disillusionment
compounds itself.


981
00:52:43.751 --> 00:52:47.422
He stayed around the Army
for a few more months,


982
00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:49.715
but his heart just
wasn't in it anymore.


983
00:52:49.757 --> 00:52:55.430
He went back home and
he thought it would be easy


984
00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:59.225
to get a good job because
of his Army experience,


985
00:52:59.267 --> 00:53:01.727
but he found that it wasn't.

986
00:53:01.769 --> 00:53:04.730
Failure was eating at him.

987
00:53:04.772 --> 00:53:09.068
He told us that "I feel like I
reached a pinnacle in the Army


988
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:14.491
and then after that everything
was just mediocrity."


989
00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:19.287
He becomes more and more
disaffected.


990
00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:21.747
He becomes more and
more strident.


991
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:25.918
He began paying attention to the
really far-off conspiracies,


992
00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.896
like that the United Nations
was going to take over


993
00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:34.427
the United States, and he
totally bought into them.


994
00:53:34.469 --> 00:53:38.223
And he also
becomes very influenced


995
00:53:38.264 --> 00:53:41.434
by The Turner Diaries.

996
00:53:41.476 --> 00:53:43.769
He becomes just gripped
by this novel.


997
00:53:45.313 --> 00:53:50.193
He was really interested
in this character, Earl Turner,


998
00:53:50.235 --> 00:53:52.778
and his antigovernment views

999
00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:57.701
and his feeling that you needed
to take drastic action


1000
00:53:57.741 --> 00:53:59.743
to make the government
take notice.


1001
00:54:01.787 --> 00:54:04.790
And then Ruby Ridge happened.

1002
00:54:04.832 --> 00:54:08.836
And Ruby Ridge absolutely
enraged McVeigh.


1003
00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.714
He felt it was murder.

1004
00:54:10.754 --> 00:54:12.798
He felt it was all about

1005
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.595
attacking the rights of people
to own guns.


1006
00:54:18.846 --> 00:54:20.306
He was not happy.

1007
00:54:20.348 --> 00:54:21.908
He wasn't getting along
with his family.


1008
00:54:21.933 --> 00:54:23.809
He didn't have a girlfriend.

1009
00:54:23.851 --> 00:54:28.814
He took his old beat-up car and
essentially began an odyssey,


1010
00:54:28.856 --> 00:54:31.276
traveling around the western
parts of the country,


1011
00:54:31.317 --> 00:54:34.820
kind of absorbing more and
more and more of this ideology.


1012
00:54:34.862 --> 00:54:39.117
And probably the single
most important place


1013
00:54:39.158 --> 00:54:44.163
where ideas of the radical right
were spread were gun shows.


1014
00:54:44.205 --> 00:54:49.835
Gun shows were sometimes more
than just gun shows.


1015
00:54:49.877 --> 00:54:53.673
The antigovernment message,
which cloaked itself


1016
00:54:53.715 --> 00:54:57.385
in the paraphernalia
of patriotism,


1017
00:54:57.427 --> 00:55:02.932
was promoted and peddled
at gun shows all over.


1018
00:55:05.893 --> 00:55:07.371
There were a number of people

1019
00:55:07.395 --> 00:55:09.648
who traveled from gun
show to gun show,


1020
00:55:09.689 --> 00:55:11.023
selling and trading,

1021
00:55:11.065 --> 00:55:14.860
and Timothy McVeigh
became one of these people.


1022
00:55:14.902 --> 00:55:18.406
And in the process
he met white supremacists


1023
00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:19.865
and talked to them.

1024
00:55:19.907 --> 00:55:21.701
He sold The Turner Diaries.

1025
00:55:21.743 --> 00:55:25.497
He became embroiled
in the larger movement.


1026
00:55:26.665 --> 00:55:30.627
And then he shows up at Waco.

1027
00:55:30.669 --> 00:55:32.878
He can't believe it,
that, you know,


1028
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.510
American citizens are being held
there by government agents.


1029
00:55:39.761 --> 00:55:42.347
And it rivets his attention.

1030
00:55:42.388 --> 00:55:44.808
Who were the aggressors?

1031
00:55:44.848 --> 00:55:48.353
Koresh wasn't giving in,
that's true,


1032
00:55:48.394 --> 00:55:50.854
but the FBI were the aggressors,
okay?


1033
00:55:50.896 --> 00:55:56.486
Everything they do exudes
that they are at war.


1034
00:55:56.528 --> 00:55:58.780
They're a military force at war.

1035
00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:01.741
The thing is,
who are they at war with?


1036
00:56:01.783 --> 00:56:05.704
Well, they're at war
with the American people.


1037
00:56:05.745 --> 00:56:08.414
In Waco, Texas,
the 40th day of the siege


1038
00:56:08.456 --> 00:56:10.416
at David Koresh's compound
is ending


1039
00:56:10.458 --> 00:56:12.084
just like the other 39--

1040
00:56:12.126 --> 00:56:14.878
with Koresh and his followers
on the inside,


1041
00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.923
and federal agents outside
waiting for something to happen.


1042
00:56:17.965 --> 00:56:20.926
David Koresh, pick up the phone.

1043
00:56:20.968 --> 00:56:23.596
The negotiators want to speak
with you.


1044
00:56:23.638 --> 00:56:26.516
As the negotiations continued,

1045
00:56:26.558 --> 00:56:30.894
the productivity of those
negotiations diminished,


1046
00:56:30.936 --> 00:56:34.940
mainly, I think, because David
was done sending out the people


1047
00:56:34.982 --> 00:56:36.234
that he intended to send out.

1048
00:56:40.405 --> 00:56:43.449
Those of us that left were
leaving because


1049
00:56:43.491 --> 00:56:47.704
we were not good for the group.

1050
00:56:47.746 --> 00:56:52.417
We were not going to help
the group ascend.


1051
00:56:52.458 --> 00:56:55.294
So we were kicked out.

1052
00:56:58.922 --> 00:57:05.847
The last person came out of that
compound on the 21st of March.


1053
00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:11.728
The last child came out
the 5th of March.


1054
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:15.273
We were in a very difficult
situation.


1055
00:57:15.314 --> 00:57:18.025
You know, you guys, you guys,
you do it your way,


1056
00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:19.402
I do it my way.

1057
00:57:19.444 --> 00:57:20.986
You're going to argue with me,

1058
00:57:21.028 --> 00:57:22.798
you catch me on the side
of the road somewhere,


1059
00:57:22.822 --> 00:57:24.198
and you come and argue with me.

1060
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.325
You come pointing guns
in the direction of my wives


1061
00:57:26.367 --> 00:57:31.372
and my kids, dammit, I'll meet
you at the door any time.


1062
00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.458
Nobody's fooled here.

1063
00:57:33.499 --> 00:57:35.919
We're not negotiating, okay?

1064
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.379
That's over, if it ever existed.

1065
00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:42.967
We weren't accomplishing
anything.


1066
00:57:43.008 --> 00:57:44.636
We were just in a situation

1067
00:57:44.677 --> 00:57:46.638
that all it could do
was grow worse.


1068
00:57:49.515 --> 00:57:53.018
More and more people within
the bureau began to come around


1069
00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.146
to the idea that they needed
to do something


1070
00:57:55.187 --> 00:57:58.023
to force Koresh's hand.

1071
00:57:58.065 --> 00:58:03.028
So the FBI went to the attorney
general, Janet Reno, with a plan


1072
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:06.699
to use armored vehicles
to knock holes into the building


1073
00:58:06.741 --> 00:58:10.829
and spray in tear gas.

1074
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.246
Initially she refused it.

1075
00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:13.832
She asked for more information.

1076
00:58:13.873 --> 00:58:18.753
So the FBI went back
with testimony


1077
00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:21.213
from former Davidians
of child sexual abuse


1078
00:58:21.255 --> 00:58:24.049
going on in Mt. Carmel.

1079
00:58:24.091 --> 00:58:28.847
And she saw the videotape
evidence of these young girls


1080
00:58:28.888 --> 00:58:31.808
with these babies,
and it confirmed to her


1081
00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:33.058
that this was going on.

1082
00:58:34.936 --> 00:58:39.732
At that point,
Janet Reno approved the plan.


1083
00:58:42.694 --> 00:58:45.530
Everybody grab your mask.

1084
00:58:45.571 --> 00:58:48.073
Everybody grab your mask.

1085
00:58:48.115 --> 00:58:50.827
A number of times early on,

1086
00:58:50.869 --> 00:58:54.079
we had gotten court-authorized
permission


1087
00:58:54.121 --> 00:58:57.208
to insert microphones
into that building.


1088
00:58:57.249 --> 00:59:01.086
That morning,
we couldn't hear anything live


1089
00:59:01.128 --> 00:59:05.049
because there was too much
noise, too much ambient noise.


1090
00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:09.345
But once the tapes are scrubbed,
someone clearly says,


1091
00:59:09.387 --> 00:59:11.806
"Put on your masks."

1092
00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:15.142
Shortly after that,
you distinctly hear


1093
00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:18.187
orders to spread the fuel.

1094
00:59:34.453 --> 00:59:38.708
All the while our guys
were inserting tear gas,


1095
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:39.959
they were spreading fuel.

1096
00:59:40.001 --> 00:59:42.879
All morning long.

1097
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:45.673
Had we heard that,
"Spread the fuel,"


1098
00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:47.299
we would have pulled back.

1099
00:59:47.341 --> 00:59:49.844
We would have pulled away.

1100
00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.763
And then, of course,
what happened,


1101
00:59:51.804 --> 00:59:54.599
it was just devastating
to everybody.


1102
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.559
As you can see on
your screen,


1103
00:59:56.601 --> 00:59:59.353
there is a great deal of smoke
coming out from the building.


1104
00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.146
Let's go to Mike Capps...

1105
01:00:01.188 --> 01:00:02.857
we can also see some flames
there now.


1106
01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.233
Mike, what can you tell us?

1107
01:00:04.275 --> 01:00:05.651
What can you see?

1108
01:00:05.693 --> 01:00:07.379
Well, Bonnie,
for the last 15 minutes,


1109
01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:10.656
we've watched this M60 vehicle,
this combat engineering vehicle,


1110
01:00:10.698 --> 01:00:14.077
make large holes in the side
of this building


1111
01:00:14.159 --> 01:00:16.120
and pump tear gas in there.

1112
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:19.290
Now we have a very large-scale
fire breaking out


1113
01:00:19.331 --> 01:00:21.042
on what must be the south side,

1114
01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:24.169
right near the front side
of this building.


1115
01:00:24.211 --> 01:00:26.089
I went out to the roadblock,

1116
01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:29.592
and was looking through
a friend's television camera,


1117
01:00:29.634 --> 01:00:31.677
and noticed little tiny
licks of flame,


1118
01:00:31.719 --> 01:00:32.905
first out of one side
of the building,


1119
01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.055
then out of the other.

1120
01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:38.059
And in a matter of
it seemed like seconds,


1121
01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:40.645
the building was engulfed.

1122
01:00:40.686 --> 01:00:43.648
You know, we all stood there
waiting to see


1123
01:00:43.689 --> 01:00:46.191
the people come out.

1124
01:00:46.233 --> 01:00:50.404
You know, there were 80 or 90
people in there.


1125
01:00:53.699 --> 01:00:59.413
As that fire continued to build,
a few adults came out.


1126
01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:03.709
One of them had jumped out of
the second floor window,


1127
01:01:03.751 --> 01:01:07.212
and then she ran back
into the fire.


1128
01:01:07.254 --> 01:01:11.216
An agent started to run after
her, went into the building,


1129
01:01:11.258 --> 01:01:12.885
grabbed her,
and pulled her out,


1130
01:01:12.927 --> 01:01:15.220
and she was ready to ignite.

1131
01:01:15.262 --> 01:01:19.350
I mean, there was smoke
trailing off of her clothes.


1132
01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:24.188
Nine adults came out.

1133
01:01:24.229 --> 01:01:28.192
Not one of them
brought a child out.


1134
01:01:32.279 --> 01:01:36.951
The part that we played
cannot be ignored.


1135
01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:39.244
We provoked the circumstances,

1136
01:01:39.286 --> 01:01:44.249
but David Koresh decided
who was going to die.


1137
01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:46.752
What happened was to serve
his purpose,


1138
01:01:46.794 --> 01:01:49.047
and that's the most
devastating thing to me,


1139
01:01:49.088 --> 01:01:52.383
is I served his purpose
to a terrible degree.


1140
01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:07.481
When I saw the fire,

1141
01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:11.569
all I could think about
were the children in there.


1142
01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:13.696
You know, the parents had made
their own decisions,


1143
01:02:13.738 --> 01:02:15.573
but those kids didn't make
any decisions.


1144
01:02:17.825 --> 01:02:21.286
I literally bawled
when I saw it.


1145
01:02:21.328 --> 01:02:26.042
It was Armageddon,
just like he said it would be.


1146
01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:52.026
At Ruby Ridge, Americans saw
the deaths of two people.


1147
01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:55.947
But at Waco,
they saw massive deaths.


1148
01:02:55.988 --> 01:02:58.532
There were people who had
a legitimate argument


1149
01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.409
that there were all kinds
of mistakes made


1150
01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:02.327
and this could have ended
very differently.


1151
01:03:02.369 --> 01:03:06.540
But other people were saying
this was a government massacre


1152
01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:09.293
on a scale
nobody had seen before.


1153
01:03:11.378 --> 01:03:15.841
It was certainly framed
in this manner by the far right,


1154
01:03:15.883 --> 01:03:18.970
and the reaction
was almost immediate.


1155
01:03:19.011 --> 01:03:22.473
We have several witnesses
that say that they saw


1156
01:03:22.514 --> 01:03:25.101
25 to 30 people exiting out
these double doors


1157
01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:28.479
to escape the fire, and that
these people were gunned down


1158
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.355
in cold blood
as they tried to escape.


1159
01:03:30.397 --> 01:03:34.944
There were several films made
by people on the radical right,


1160
01:03:34.986 --> 01:03:37.321
which claimed that this had been
a deliberate murder.


1161
01:03:37.362 --> 01:03:41.366
One of the
earliest was a documentary


1162
01:03:41.408 --> 01:03:43.786
The Big Lie.

1163
01:03:43.828 --> 01:03:46.914
The crucial footage
that they used


1164
01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.582
was footage on the day
of the fire,


1165
01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:51.543
where they alleged that
if you looked at the footage


1166
01:03:51.585 --> 01:03:54.213
the right way,
that you could see


1167
01:03:54.255 --> 01:03:57.216
the tanks actually setting fire
to the building.


1168
01:03:57.258 --> 01:03:59.444
At the same time as fire
was already breaking out


1169
01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.762
in the back of the house,
as you just saw,


1170
01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.973
as this tank backs out,
flame can be seen


1171
01:04:04.015 --> 01:04:05.933
shooting from the front of it.

1172
01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.686
When someone could
package the footage


1173
01:04:08.727 --> 01:04:11.105
that had disturbed
everybody in America


1174
01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:16.694
with a potent message about,
you know, government atrocities,


1175
01:04:16.735 --> 01:04:18.863
it touched a chord.

1176
01:04:18.904 --> 01:04:22.491
You know, those who had a
tendency to doubt the government


1177
01:04:22.533 --> 01:04:26.078
were enraged.

1178
01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.414
When the fire started at Waco,

1179
01:04:29.456 --> 01:04:33.418
Tim McVeigh was at a friend's
farmhouse up in Michigan.


1180
01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.965
He was working on a vehicle
out in the yard


1181
01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:40.885
and somebody yelled out,
"Tim, come in here.


1182
01:04:40.926 --> 01:04:42.403
You've got to see this on
television."


1183
01:04:42.427 --> 01:04:45.931
I'm watching flames
lick out windows,


1184
01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:48.893
and I'm watching
tanks ram walls,


1185
01:04:48.934 --> 01:04:51.812
and my eyes just welled up
in tears,


1186
01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:54.606
and tears started
coming down my cheeks


1187
01:04:54.648 --> 01:04:57.818
as I'm watching
this scene unfold.


1188
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.404
I'm not going to shy away from
the word rage.


1189
01:05:00.445 --> 01:05:03.782
For me, I felt absolute rage.

1190
01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:08.453
For Tim McVeigh,
it was all happening


1191
01:05:08.495 --> 01:05:13.709
because of the U.S. government,
the biggest bully in the world.


1192
01:05:16.003 --> 01:05:20.465
And just a few months later,
the Brady Bill passes.


1193
01:05:20.507 --> 01:05:25.763
It has a ban on several assault
weapons, long overdue.


1194
01:05:25.804 --> 01:05:29.308
Like many people, Tim McVeigh
was convinced


1195
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:32.228
that the Brady Bill meant
that the government


1196
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:36.399
was going to take guns away
from law-abiding citizens.


1197
01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.483
A ban on handgun ownership

1198
01:05:38.525 --> 01:05:42.280
and restrictions on possession
of handguns by minors,


1199
01:05:42.321 --> 01:05:43.239
the beginning of reform

1200
01:05:43.281 --> 01:05:46.284
of our federal firearms
licensing systems.


1201
01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:53.332
The combination of the perceived
government assassination


1202
01:05:53.374 --> 01:05:54.541
of the Weaver family,

1203
01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:58.670
the perceived military
government murdering


1204
01:05:58.712 --> 01:06:03.592
its own citizens in Waco,
and then the Brady Bill,


1205
01:06:03.634 --> 01:06:06.511
the government coming after
your guns,


1206
01:06:06.553 --> 01:06:11.642
just exploded the recruitment
of anti-government extremists.


1207
01:06:11.683 --> 01:06:15.187
We have a government
that is on the verge


1208
01:06:15.229 --> 01:06:18.149
of being completely out
of control.


1209
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:22.194
They allow tyrants to come in
with hooded masks on,


1210
01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:26.157
unidentified,
bust down your door.


1211
01:06:26.198 --> 01:06:29.118
It's happened all over America.

1212
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.037
This is the new thing
in America.


1213
01:06:32.079 --> 01:06:33.538
It's called the militia.

1214
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.666
No, they say
they're not racist.


1215
01:06:35.707 --> 01:06:37.394
It's not just about guns
and possession of guns,


1216
01:06:37.418 --> 01:06:40.129
but the 2nd Amendment's
involved here, definitely.


1217
01:06:40.171 --> 01:06:41.630
They're proud of
their 2nd amendment.


1218
01:06:41.672 --> 01:06:45.550
And by God no constable is going
to come from some faraway place


1219
01:06:45.592 --> 01:06:47.886
and break their
door down.


1220
01:06:47.928 --> 01:06:49.930
They'll shoot 'em first.

1221
01:06:51.598 --> 01:06:56.270
There had been a spurt of growth
in militia organizations


1222
01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:58.481
after Ruby Ridge.

1223
01:06:58.522 --> 01:07:03.986
But Waco, and the Brady Bill,
accelerates the movement.


1224
01:07:04.028 --> 01:07:06.571
By the end of '93,

1225
01:07:06.613 --> 01:07:11.494
there was a huge underground of
armed white supremacist militias


1226
01:07:11.576 --> 01:07:16.290
all over the country,
all of them dedicated


1227
01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:19.210
to resistance
to the federal government.


1228
01:07:22.629 --> 01:07:26.425
Tim McVeigh didn't actually
belong to a militia group


1229
01:07:26.467 --> 01:07:30.346
but he certainly
had the same opinions


1230
01:07:30.388 --> 01:07:33.307
about the government that many
of the militia groups had.


1231
01:07:35.267 --> 01:07:36.601
For Tim McVeigh,

1232
01:07:36.643 --> 01:07:40.856
it was all part of a massive
government conspiracy.


1233
01:07:40.898 --> 01:07:46.195
All these events,
they were all connected


1234
01:07:46.237 --> 01:07:50.741
and it was all leading down
a path that was going to end


1235
01:07:50.782 --> 01:07:54.119
with federal agents
coming to his home


1236
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:57.498
and the homes of gun owners
all over America


1237
01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:02.545
and storming into those homes
and taking their guns away.


1238
01:08:04.671 --> 01:08:06.631
I think from that moment on,

1239
01:08:06.673 --> 01:08:10.635
he was trying to determine what
terrorist act to commit


1240
01:08:10.677 --> 01:08:13.389
against the U.S. government.

1241
01:08:25.692 --> 01:08:29.238
"My day's work started a little
before 5:00 yesterday


1242
01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.116
"when I began helping Ed Sanders
mix heating oil


1243
01:08:32.157 --> 01:08:37.662
with the ammonium nitrate
fertilizer in unit 8's garage."


1244
01:08:37.704 --> 01:08:41.083
Tim McVeigh had read
in The Turner Diaries


1245
01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:44.836
of how, generally, you
could build a truck bomb.


1246
01:08:44.878 --> 01:08:48.673
He found other articles

1247
01:08:48.715 --> 01:08:53.887
that told him exactly
how to build a truck bomb.


1248
01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.724
He wanted to do what
Earl Turner did:


1249
01:08:57.766 --> 01:09:00.269
take down a government building.

1250
01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:12.323
McVeigh truly believed that
he had two comrades in arms


1251
01:09:12.364 --> 01:09:15.033
in Terry Nichols
and Michael Fortier.


1252
01:09:15.075 --> 01:09:18.703
They go back to the Army.

1253
01:09:18.745 --> 01:09:21.790
They all like
The Turner Diaries.


1254
01:09:21.832 --> 01:09:25.169
They all shared the same
antigovernment thoughts.


1255
01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:29.714
They all wanted to show
that somebody could attack


1256
01:09:29.756 --> 01:09:32.676
the U.S. government,
that it was that vulnerable.


1257
01:09:34.553 --> 01:09:38.890
To get started, they knew that
they needed the main ingredient,


1258
01:09:38.932 --> 01:09:41.477
which was fertilizer.

1259
01:09:41.519 --> 01:09:48.733
They start to buy bag after bag
after bag of ammonium nitrate.


1260
01:09:48.775 --> 01:09:52.737
Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols
break into a storage shed


1261
01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:57.826
at a quarry and they steal
these explosive Tovex sausages,


1262
01:09:57.868 --> 01:10:00.704
which will make the bomb
more powerful.


1263
01:10:02.623 --> 01:10:05.334
It wasn't easy to get
some of this stuff.


1264
01:10:05.376 --> 01:10:07.961
Some of the explosives
were not available


1265
01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.547
to the average citizen.

1266
01:10:09.588 --> 01:10:14.759
They spent months and months
getting the parts


1267
01:10:14.801 --> 01:10:17.095
of this bomb together.

1268
01:10:17.137 --> 01:10:20.849
Fortier's role was
very, very limited.


1269
01:10:20.891 --> 01:10:23.977
Nichols had a bigger role,

1270
01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:28.106
but, really, just following
orders from McVeigh.


1271
01:10:28.148 --> 01:10:31.776
And then, Tim McVeigh
manages to get


1272
01:10:31.818 --> 01:10:37.199
some 55-gallon drums of
nitromethane racing fuel.


1273
01:10:37.241 --> 01:10:39.910
The bomb that was depicted
in The Turner Diaries


1274
01:10:39.951 --> 01:10:41.786
was ammonium nitrate
and fuel oil.


1275
01:10:41.828 --> 01:10:47.376
McVeigh was going to amp up his
bomb really dramatically


1276
01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:50.546
by using this much, much
more volatile fuel.


1277
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.927
During this time
that he was driving around


1278
01:10:56.968 --> 01:10:58.803
getting his materials
for the bomb,


1279
01:10:58.845 --> 01:11:03.767
McVeigh was basically on this
anti-government odyssey.


1280
01:11:05.852 --> 01:11:14.819
He visited a militia compound,
he visited Area 51 in Roswell,


1281
01:11:14.861 --> 01:11:17.197
and he visited Waco.

1282
01:11:19.199 --> 01:11:23.662
It was very important to him
to go bear witness


1283
01:11:23.704 --> 01:11:26.248
to what had happened,

1284
01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:30.794
to make himself feel that-that
place and that moment.


1285
01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.593
It was also around this time

1286
01:11:37.635 --> 01:11:41.054
that he and Fortier and Nichols
began selecting


1287
01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:44.683
what was going to be the target
of their bomb.


1288
01:11:44.725 --> 01:11:47.311
They went to Little Rock,
Arkansas.


1289
01:11:47.352 --> 01:11:49.730
They went to Tulsa.

1290
01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.649
They went to Dallas.

1291
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:55.986
They picked the Murrah Building
in Oklahoma City, in part,


1292
01:11:56.027 --> 01:11:57.529
because the ATF,

1293
01:11:57.571 --> 01:12:00.991
who had conducted the raid
on the Branch Davidians,


1294
01:12:01.032 --> 01:12:04.244
had an office in the building.

1295
01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:06.871
They thought it was
appropriately symbolic


1296
01:12:06.913 --> 01:12:08.457
that they would go after
somebody


1297
01:12:08.499 --> 01:12:10.793
who was directly connected
to Waco.


1298
01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:16.965
The Murrah Building
had numerous federal offices.


1299
01:12:17.007 --> 01:12:19.884
It had HUD, it had the ATF.

1300
01:12:19.926 --> 01:12:23.138
It had general accounting
offices.


1301
01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.557
It had military recruiters,

1302
01:12:25.599 --> 01:12:27.392
the Social Security
Administration,


1303
01:12:27.434 --> 01:12:28.727
the DEA was in there.

1304
01:12:28.769 --> 01:12:31.271
And there is some question
as to whether or not


1305
01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:34.566
McVeigh knew there was
a day care in there,


1306
01:12:34.608 --> 01:12:36.318
but he also kind of indicated

1307
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.570
that it wouldn't have made
the difference anyway.


1308
01:12:39.946 --> 01:12:44.618
Michael Fortier began feeling
uneasy about doing this.


1309
01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.706
He suddenly visualized
what was going to happen.


1310
01:12:50.415 --> 01:12:52.710
He points out that there were
probably going to be


1311
01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:55.920
innocent people inside
that are going to die.


1312
01:12:55.962 --> 01:12:59.800
McVeigh told him,
"There has to be a body count."


1313
01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:05.096
He said, "The government's not
going to sit up and take notice


1314
01:13:05.138 --> 01:13:06.557
unless there's a body count."

1315
01:13:06.598 --> 01:13:08.308
"They can always build
a new building,


1316
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.994
but a body count
will get their attention."


1317
01:13:10.018 --> 01:13:14.732
From a military perspective,
to get a message across,


1318
01:13:14.773 --> 01:13:20.111
you need to hurt them
where they hurt the most.


1319
01:13:20.153 --> 01:13:22.280
The only way they're going
to feel something,


1320
01:13:22.322 --> 01:13:24.366
and the only way they're going
to get the message


1321
01:13:24.408 --> 01:13:26.869
is with a body count.

1322
01:13:29.747 --> 01:13:32.957
Tim picks April 19
for the bombing


1323
01:13:32.999 --> 01:13:38.004
because it will be the
anniversary of the fire at Waco.


1324
01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:41.717
On Easter Sunday,
three days before,


1325
01:13:41.759 --> 01:13:44.969
Tim McVeigh calls Terry Nichols
and says it's time.


1326
01:13:45.011 --> 01:13:49.725
He and Nichols, separately,

1327
01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:54.646
drove from Kansas
to Oklahoma City.


1328
01:13:54.688 --> 01:13:58.316
McVeigh took his $300
getaway car


1329
01:13:58.358 --> 01:14:01.986
and stashed it in a little
parking lot.


1330
01:14:02.028 --> 01:14:06.157
He put a sign in the window,
"Please Do Not Tow,"


1331
01:14:06.199 --> 01:14:11.079
and then they
drove back to Kansas.


1332
01:14:11.121 --> 01:14:14.082
The next day McVeigh goes alone,
apparently,


1333
01:14:14.124 --> 01:14:16.835
to rent a truck
in Junction City,


1334
01:14:16.877 --> 01:14:21.005
the big Ryder truck
that he will use as a bomb.


1335
01:14:21.047 --> 01:14:23.717
"Do you need insurance on it?"

1336
01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.236
He said, "No, I won't need
any insurance."


1337
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.654
And they said,
"Do you need any extra days?"


1338
01:14:26.678 --> 01:14:28.030
And he answered, "No,
I won't need any extra days."


1339
01:14:28.054 --> 01:14:32.016
We actually have him on video
coming in to the McDonald's


1340
01:14:32.058 --> 01:14:34.978
about a mile away from
where he picked up the truck.


1341
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:42.820
April 18 was bomb making day.

1342
01:14:42.861 --> 01:14:48.158
McVeigh drove the truck out
to Geary Lake State Park,


1343
01:14:48.199 --> 01:14:51.077
where they would assemble
the bomb.


1344
01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:53.497
He was extremely upset

1345
01:14:53.538 --> 01:14:56.207
because Nichols was starting
to get cold feet.


1346
01:14:56.249 --> 01:15:01.045
He threatened to kill Nichols
and his family


1347
01:15:01.087 --> 01:15:05.759
if Nichols refused to help him
with the final preparations.


1348
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:09.513
The bomb was primarily assembled
by myself,


1349
01:15:09.554 --> 01:15:11.598
with a little assistance
from another,


1350
01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.101
who was under duress
to assist me.


1351
01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:17.061
I was the one that primed
the charges,


1352
01:15:17.103 --> 01:15:20.607
that crimped the caps to
the fuse, primed each barrel,


1353
01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:23.026
made sure there was
redundant fusing systems.


1354
01:15:23.067 --> 01:15:25.821
And it only took three hours.

1355
01:15:25.863 --> 01:15:28.198
After they get the bomb built,

1356
01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:31.368
Terry Nichols made it very clear
he was not going to join McVeigh


1357
01:15:31.409 --> 01:15:33.119
the morning of the bombing.

1358
01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:37.666
And so they said goodbye, shook
hands, Nichols wishes him luck,


1359
01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:41.044
and then he gets in the truck
and he drives south.


1360
01:15:46.132 --> 01:15:49.761
He was nervous as he drove
into Oklahoma City,


1361
01:15:50.762 --> 01:15:55.225
but I don't think
he ever second-guessed himself.


1362
01:15:55.266 --> 01:15:57.561
I don't think he ever thought
for a minute


1363
01:15:57.602 --> 01:16:00.271
that this was the wrong thing
to do.


1364
01:16:03.274 --> 01:16:05.569
When he got close
to the building,


1365
01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:07.946
he pulled the truck over,

1366
01:16:07.988 --> 01:16:12.158
and lit two different fuses
leading back to the bomb.


1367
01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:18.832
The last video that
we have of him was at 8:57


1368
01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:22.293
in front of the
Regency Tower Apartments.


1369
01:16:22.335 --> 01:16:24.629
At that point in time,
he was about


1370
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:27.007
a block and a half
west of the Murrah Building.


1371
01:16:28.592 --> 01:16:30.886
As I was driving past,

1372
01:16:30.928 --> 01:16:33.513
I noticed this yellow
Ryder truck


1373
01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:37.809
pulled into the loading zone
in front of the building.


1374
01:16:37.851 --> 01:16:40.854
A young man got
out of the truck.


1375
01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:44.649
He had a military haircut
and the T-shirt, and I thought,


1376
01:16:44.691 --> 01:16:47.277
"Well, okay, that's a sergeant
or something


1377
01:16:47.318 --> 01:16:49.153
"checking into the command.

1378
01:16:49.195 --> 01:16:50.697
"But what in the world
is he doing


1379
01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:53.116
going away from the building?"

1380
01:16:54.785 --> 01:16:58.538
I walked very slowly
toward the YMCA.


1381
01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.458
Once I got in the blind alley
of the YMCA,


1382
01:17:01.499 --> 01:17:05.087
I did jog because I knew
nobody was looking.


1383
01:17:32.697 --> 01:17:34.157
Later that morning,

1384
01:17:34.198 --> 01:17:38.202
we went into the south side
of the building, not knowing


1385
01:17:38.244 --> 01:17:40.789
what we were fixing to walk
into was the daycare center.


1386
01:17:42.332 --> 01:17:44.584
The granite floor was
all busted and broken


1387
01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:47.754
and just, you know,
going every which way.


1388
01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.213
And as I'm fixing to go in,

1389
01:17:49.255 --> 01:17:53.217
one of the Oklahoma City
officers comes walking out


1390
01:17:53.259 --> 01:17:54.385
carrying a little boy.

1391
01:17:54.427 --> 01:17:56.096
It's where the elevators
used to be!


1392
01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.388
I can't.

1393
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:59.141
Let me have him.
I can't.


1394
01:17:59.182 --> 01:18:00.266
And I just turned

1395
01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:04.104
and took a second breath and
went into the daycare center.


1396
01:18:07.107 --> 01:18:10.234
We were moving debris,
we were picking up boulders.


1397
01:18:10.276 --> 01:18:13.321
Literally everyone was digging
on their hands and knees,


1398
01:18:13.363 --> 01:18:14.906
trying to get to these kids.

1399
01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:23.832
The children were coming out
one by one.


1400
01:18:23.874 --> 01:18:26.960
Brandon was severely injured.

1401
01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:30.005
So was Nekia.

1402
01:18:30.047 --> 01:18:34.592
Rebecca, um, just seemed to me,
and I...


1403
01:18:34.634 --> 01:18:37.137
it just seemed as though
she was just dipped in blood.


1404
01:18:38.889 --> 01:18:40.765
The next baby
that they brought out,


1405
01:18:40.807 --> 01:18:43.852
they went to lay
this baby on the ground.


1406
01:18:45.812 --> 01:18:48.940
They had these perfectly folded
white sheets


1407
01:18:48.982 --> 01:18:50.775
and they would bring
another one out,


1408
01:18:50.817 --> 01:18:54.278
and they would bring another
one, and another one.


1409
01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.702
And they lay them in a line,
wrapped in these sheets.


1410
01:19:00.744 --> 01:19:05.373
And then a nurse came,
and she moved the blanket


1411
01:19:05.415 --> 01:19:08.251
back from their feet,

1412
01:19:08.292 --> 01:19:13.090
and she was writing things, and
she tagged their little feet.


1413
01:19:13.131 --> 01:19:17.301
And I think that's
when reality, you know, set in,


1414
01:19:17.343 --> 01:19:20.263
that my son Tevin's
not coming home.


1415
01:19:23.307 --> 01:19:25.578
When a baby's body was carried
out of that building,


1416
01:19:25.602 --> 01:19:28.105
even though one person
carried that baby,


1417
01:19:28.146 --> 01:19:30.815
we all carried that baby.

1418
01:19:30.857 --> 01:19:32.984
And when we laid him down onto
that makeshift morgue


1419
01:19:33.026 --> 01:19:34.694
and lined those children up
out there,


1420
01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:36.863
that was really
a hard thing to see,


1421
01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:39.323
because that was all
of our kids.


1422
01:19:39.365 --> 01:19:41.534
That was everybody's kids.

1423
01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.369
That wasn't just
one person's child.


1424
01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:44.871
They belonged to everybody.

1425
01:19:55.381 --> 01:19:58.969
The emotions that we felt and
still feel to this day


1426
01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:01.763
from what we saw was
just remarkable.


1427
01:20:04.182 --> 01:20:07.644
And the kids that survived
and came through that


1428
01:20:07.685 --> 01:20:10.605
was just absolutely incredible.

1429
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.821
Our children ended up
at two different hospitals.


1430
01:20:17.862 --> 01:20:20.406
And once we found them,

1431
01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.659
we just made up our minds

1432
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:25.411
that Claudia was gonna be
with Rebecca


1433
01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.080
and I was gonna be with Brandon.

1434
01:20:37.548 --> 01:20:40.177
When I got there,
Brandon had just had


1435
01:20:40.218 --> 01:20:42.762
a four-and-a-half-hour
brain surgery.


1436
01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:44.514
How's Daddy's
big boy, huh?


1437
01:20:44.555 --> 01:20:47.684
He had a piece of something
blown into the upper left side


1438
01:20:47.725 --> 01:20:50.645
of his head
that went into his brain.


1439
01:20:52.897 --> 01:20:57.401
Dr. Reynolds, his neurosurgeon,
could not tell us


1440
01:20:57.443 --> 01:20:58.736
whether he'd live or not.

1441
01:21:02.365 --> 01:21:03.950
We knew for an absolute fact

1442
01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:07.662
that our children
were 50 feet from it.


1443
01:21:07.704 --> 01:21:10.248
50 feet from a massive bomb.

1444
01:21:12.583 --> 01:21:14.627
There was five children
sitting at a table


1445
01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:18.381
in the daycare center,
and one in the bathroom.


1446
01:21:18.422 --> 01:21:20.133
And those six survived.

1447
01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:25.847
When I saw Rebecca
for the first time,


1448
01:21:25.889 --> 01:21:29.433
the doctor said,
"She's going to be fine."


1449
01:21:29.475 --> 01:21:32.187
She has a lot of cuts, bruises,

1450
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:35.357
and she has a broken
collarbone.


1451
01:21:35.398 --> 01:21:37.400
But she was alive.

1452
01:21:39.944 --> 01:21:44.741
At 9:02 that day,
our world ended.


1453
01:21:44.782 --> 01:21:47.244
And then when we found our kids,

1454
01:21:47.285 --> 01:21:53.791
our new world began at 4:00
on April 19.


1455
01:21:53.833 --> 01:21:56.253
I love you, baby.

1456
01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:08.306
How you doing today, sir?

1457
01:22:08.348 --> 01:22:09.491
We're currently conducting
an investigation


1458
01:22:09.515 --> 01:22:10.767
into the Oklahoma City
bombing.


1459
01:22:10.808 --> 01:22:13.019
Do you usually travel
this road very much?


1460
01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.938
We operate under the premise

1461
01:22:14.979 --> 01:22:18.482
that the evidence leads you
to where you want to go.


1462
01:22:18.524 --> 01:22:22.987
We have to gather every bit
of evidence that we can


1463
01:22:23.029 --> 01:22:27.033
and then start trying to form
hypotheses and theories


1464
01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:29.535
as to what has transpired.

1465
01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.621
Did you notice
a Ryder truck?


1466
01:22:31.662 --> 01:22:34.291
The first real break
of the investigation,


1467
01:22:34.332 --> 01:22:36.376
which happened within hours
of the bombing,


1468
01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:38.211
was we found the rear axle

1469
01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:41.505
of what turned out
to be the bomb truck.


1470
01:22:41.547 --> 01:22:44.050
On the rear axle assembly,
there's what's called


1471
01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:46.636
a confidential vehicle
identification number,


1472
01:22:46.677 --> 01:22:49.513
which was PVA26077.

1473
01:22:49.555 --> 01:22:51.015
I'll never forget that number.

1474
01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:57.439
We were able to trace that
number to a Ryder truck


1475
01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.526
assigned to Elliott's Body Shop
in Junction City, Kansas.


1476
01:23:02.568 --> 01:23:05.488
We immediately deployed
special agents


1477
01:23:05.529 --> 01:23:07.907
to that Ryder truck rental shop.

1478
01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:10.910
We learned that it had been
rented by a gentleman


1479
01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:13.621
with a South Dakota driver's
license


1480
01:23:13.663 --> 01:23:17.417
by the name of Robert Kling.

1481
01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:22.255
We had three principal witnesses
there inside the truck rental.


1482
01:23:22.297 --> 01:23:27.427
They described a military type
person, about six foot tall,


1483
01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:31.097
thin, close shaven.

1484
01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:35.059
They also believed that there
was a second person with him,


1485
01:23:35.101 --> 01:23:37.354
so we called these John Doe
number one


1486
01:23:37.395 --> 01:23:39.147
and John Doe number two.

1487
01:23:40.898 --> 01:23:45.820
Our agents flooded the area
of Junction City.


1488
01:23:48.198 --> 01:23:51.368
One particular agent went
to the Dreamland Motel,


1489
01:23:51.409 --> 01:23:54.496
and he asked the manager,
"Has anybody been in here


1490
01:23:54.537 --> 01:23:56.706
with a Ryder truck?"

1491
01:23:56.747 --> 01:23:59.417
She said, "Yes.

1492
01:23:59.459 --> 01:24:03.046
"I had a customer who stayed
here in room 25


1493
01:24:03.087 --> 01:24:06.007
"that had a Ryder truck parked
at the motel,


1494
01:24:06.049 --> 01:24:11.554
and I last saw him on Tuesday
morning, April the 18th."


1495
01:24:11.595 --> 01:24:14.432
After talking to her
about the Ryder truck,


1496
01:24:14.474 --> 01:24:18.811
they show her the sketch,
and she recognizes it.


1497
01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:21.105
She pulls out her records,

1498
01:24:21.147 --> 01:24:23.358
and for all of McVeigh's
planning,


1499
01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.652
he apparently had a moment
of weakness


1500
01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:31.241
and he signed his own name
to the register.


1501
01:24:31.282 --> 01:24:32.700
So that really got us.

1502
01:24:32.742 --> 01:24:34.618
We wanted to know
who Tim McVeigh was.


1503
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.120
So what we did

1504
01:24:36.162 --> 01:24:38.664
was go into the National Crime
Information Center


1505
01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:40.791
and run an offline search,

1506
01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:42.919
and try to find out if anybody
named Tim McVeigh


1507
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.646
has been arrested anywhere
in the United States


1508
01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:45.838
in the recent past.

1509
01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:51.594
It turns out
that a highway patrolman


1510
01:24:51.635 --> 01:24:55.723
has arrested someone by the name
of Timothy McVeigh.


1511
01:24:55.765 --> 01:25:03.647
He was heading off toward Kansas
in this old Mercury Marquis.


1512
01:25:03.689 --> 01:25:08.652
He'd got on the interstate, and
a state trooper pulled him over


1513
01:25:08.694 --> 01:25:14.451
because he had no license plate
on the back of his car.


1514
01:25:14.492 --> 01:25:18.662
The trooper then notices a bulge
under the driver's jacket,


1515
01:25:18.704 --> 01:25:22.041
and says, "Is that a gun?"

1516
01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:24.252
The driver acknowledges,
"Yes, it is,"


1517
01:25:24.294 --> 01:25:26.754
and Tim McVeigh
is put under arrest


1518
01:25:26.796 --> 01:25:30.258
and taken to the county jail.

1519
01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.678
The T-shirt he is wearing

1520
01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.434
says sic semper tyrannis--
"thus ever to tyrants."


1521
01:25:39.476 --> 01:25:44.272
It was what John Wilkes Booth
shouted when he shot Lincoln.


1522
01:25:46.316 --> 01:25:49.444
For two days McVeigh languished
in the jail


1523
01:25:49.486 --> 01:25:53.531
and nobody really knew
who he was.


1524
01:25:53.573 --> 01:25:57.910
Other than the fact that he was
illegally carrying a weapon,


1525
01:25:57.952 --> 01:26:03.040
the police had no suspicions
about him.


1526
01:26:03.082 --> 01:26:05.668
We called up the courthouse
there and learned


1527
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:08.588
that Timothy McVeigh was just
getting ready to appear


1528
01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:11.966
before the judge and was about
ready to be released.


1529
01:26:12.008 --> 01:26:13.717
So we said, you know,
"Put a hold on him.


1530
01:26:13.759 --> 01:26:15.136
We're on our way."

1531
01:26:18.515 --> 01:26:21.058
Two federal agents interview him

1532
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.521
in the Noble County
sheriff's office.


1533
01:26:24.562 --> 01:26:28.650
And the agents start by saying,
"Do you know why we're here?"


1534
01:26:28.691 --> 01:26:31.277
And McVeigh says,

1535
01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:34.364
"Does it have something to do
with the bombing?"


1536
01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:42.746
I am pleased to announce
that one of the individuals


1537
01:26:42.788 --> 01:26:46.626
believed to be responsible for
Wednesday's terrible attack


1538
01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:49.128
on the Murrah Federal Building
in Oklahoma City


1539
01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:51.047
has been arrested.

1540
01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:55.801
Once they know
they've got their guy,


1541
01:26:55.843 --> 01:27:00.306
the decision's made to take
him to a more secure facility.


1542
01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.808
The word is leaked out
to the press,


1543
01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:05.520
which broadcasts it on TV,

1544
01:27:05.562 --> 01:27:10.024
so people drive there
from all over to see this.


1545
01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:20.784
I and the rest of the country
saw Timothy McVeigh


1546
01:27:20.826 --> 01:27:22.620
for the very first time.

1547
01:27:22.662 --> 01:27:25.623
And we understood
in a kind of flash


1548
01:27:25.665 --> 01:27:28.459
that there were enemies
within this country.


1549
01:27:28.501 --> 01:27:32.963
Not foreign terrorists,
but red-blooded Americans


1550
01:27:33.005 --> 01:27:37.385
who were engaged in a war
against America.


1551
01:27:37.427 --> 01:27:40.804
It was just the lightning moment
of recognition.


1552
01:27:40.846 --> 01:27:43.140
This was the guy in the sketch.

1553
01:27:43.182 --> 01:27:45.809
It was that guy.

1554
01:27:45.851 --> 01:27:50.607
I think everybody felt this
sudden sense of betrayal.


1555
01:27:50.648 --> 01:27:54.818
I think everyone thought,
"You're one of us."


1556
01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.654
Mr. President,

1557
01:27:56.696 --> 01:28:01.284
is there a sense now, sir, that
this was not a foreign threat?


1558
01:28:01.325 --> 01:28:03.786
Let me say that I have never,

1559
01:28:03.827 --> 01:28:05.996
and the Justice Department has
never said,


1560
01:28:06.038 --> 01:28:08.124
that it was a foreign threat,

1561
01:28:08.165 --> 01:28:11.753
but the most important thing
that you understand


1562
01:28:11.794 --> 01:28:15.548
is that even though this is
a positive development,


1563
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:19.469
this investigation has a lot of
work still to be done in it.


1564
01:28:25.891 --> 01:28:27.727
The capture of Timothy McVeigh

1565
01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:30.813
really just launched
the investigation.


1566
01:28:30.854 --> 01:28:32.856
The circumstances, obviously,
indicated


1567
01:28:32.898 --> 01:28:36.694
that he was directly involved,
but, you know, to what extent?


1568
01:28:38.404 --> 01:28:42.992
His driver's license had an
address in Decker, Michigan.


1569
01:28:43.033 --> 01:28:47.664
We dispatched agents
to that location


1570
01:28:47.705 --> 01:28:50.500
and we find out
that the gentleman there


1571
01:28:50.541 --> 01:28:54.504
by the name of James Nichols
had a brother, Terry,


1572
01:28:54.545 --> 01:28:58.675
presently residing
in Herington, Kansas.


1573
01:28:58.716 --> 01:29:02.886
We ended up executing a search
warrant on Terry Nichols' home


1574
01:29:02.928 --> 01:29:07.891
in Kansas, and that search
warrant was a gold mine.


1575
01:29:07.933 --> 01:29:13.856
In there we found a receipt for

1576
01:29:13.897 --> 01:29:17.234
We found a cordless drill
that turned out to be


1577
01:29:17.276 --> 01:29:19.903
a key piece of evidence.

1578
01:29:19.945 --> 01:29:23.616
But probably the most important
piece of evidence


1579
01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:27.662
that we found was a calling card
in the name of Daryl Bridges,


1580
01:29:27.704 --> 01:29:32.458
who shared the same
address in Decker, Michigan.


1581
01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:37.797
There were 685 calls
made on the calling card.


1582
01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:41.300
We determined where every one of
those calls was placed from,


1583
01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:43.927
the duration of the call,
and who the call was made to.


1584
01:29:43.969 --> 01:29:49.141
So we saw many calls to chemical
companies, to barrel companies,


1585
01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:52.311
to racetracks,
all kinds of places


1586
01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:55.272
Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols
were contacting


1587
01:29:55.314 --> 01:29:59.235
to try to acquire
bomb components.


1588
01:29:59.276 --> 01:30:01.945
We also found out about
Michael Fortier


1589
01:30:01.987 --> 01:30:03.531
through the calling card.

1590
01:30:05.783 --> 01:30:08.244
He knew more than we did
about the bombing.


1591
01:30:08.285 --> 01:30:10.954
He knew, for example,
that Tim McVeigh,


1592
01:30:10.996 --> 01:30:12.832
when he was staying at their
house in Kingman,


1593
01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:15.042
had taken all these soup cans
down from the kitchen


1594
01:30:15.084 --> 01:30:18.629
and showed Michael Fortier's
wife exactly how he was going


1595
01:30:18.671 --> 01:30:23.509
to construct the bomb inside
the back of that Ryder truck.


1596
01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:28.222
Last night, Timothy McVeigh
was charged in the bombing


1597
01:30:28.264 --> 01:30:31.016
of the Murrah Federal Building
here in Oklahoma City.


1598
01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:36.397
Two brothers, James Douglas
Nichols and Terry Lynn Nichols,


1599
01:30:36.439 --> 01:30:38.524
are currently in federal custody

1600
01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:41.360
and are being held
as material witnesses.


1601
01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:43.945
Another suspect,
whom we have identified


1602
01:30:43.987 --> 01:30:49.619
as John Doe number two, remains
unidentified and at large.


1603
01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:51.871
A mistake was made.

1604
01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:56.166
The artist conception has him
with a Carolina Panthers cap on.


1605
01:30:56.208 --> 01:30:59.545
It turns out that a guy had
happened to be


1606
01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:02.005
in the Ryder truck rental shop

1607
01:31:02.047 --> 01:31:04.592
the day before
Timothy McVeigh was.


1608
01:31:04.634 --> 01:31:09.054
His description is almost
to a T.


1609
01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:11.140
Is there a John Doe two?

1610
01:31:11.181 --> 01:31:13.559
Either way I can answer it
should be scary


1611
01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:16.729
because, number one,
if there are other people,


1612
01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:18.940
that means they're still
out there.


1613
01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:22.401
On the other hand, if it was
just me, that in itself,


1614
01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:25.112
isn't that pretty scary
that one man could do that?


1615
01:31:25.154 --> 01:31:31.034
That's why "You can't handle the
truth" is the perfect line,


1616
01:31:31.076 --> 01:31:34.455
because the truth is
it was just me.


1617
01:31:42.672 --> 01:31:45.048
The prosecution hit
McVeigh's defense team


1618
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:47.426
with everything they had.

1619
01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:52.473
Michael Fortier's testimony
was crucial and damning,


1620
01:31:52.515 --> 01:31:56.894
but he also told
a very poignant story.


1621
01:31:56.936 --> 01:31:59.647
He talked about how he would
have a dream at night


1622
01:31:59.689 --> 01:32:02.608
that he was calling people
to warn them,


1623
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:06.278
and then he'd wake up,
and he was in jail,


1624
01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.197
and he hadn't made the call,

1625
01:32:08.238 --> 01:32:12.033
and that people were dead
because of him.


1626
01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:19.082
I was the second witness
in the trial,


1627
01:32:19.124 --> 01:32:22.085
and as I sat in
that witness stand,


1628
01:32:22.127 --> 01:32:28.091
it seemed just like an arm's
reach away was Timothy McVeigh.


1629
01:32:28.133 --> 01:32:32.137
He did look me in the eyes,
and he did try to intimidate me,


1630
01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:35.098
but I was far
from being intimidated.


1631
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:40.771
When I had to testify,
and people would ask later,


1632
01:32:40.813 --> 01:32:43.106
"How did you sit in
the room with the man


1633
01:32:43.148 --> 01:32:44.650
who murdered your son?"

1634
01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:48.111
And I told them my story
is more powerful


1635
01:32:48.153 --> 01:32:49.488
than me yelling at him.

1636
01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:54.744
My story is more powerful
than my fist.


1637
01:32:54.785 --> 01:32:57.371
I'm not going to go
to his level.


1638
01:32:57.413 --> 01:33:00.416
You know, I deserve better;
Tevin deserved better.


1639
01:33:00.457 --> 01:33:05.086
Every victim of the bombing
deserved better than that.


1640
01:33:19.309 --> 01:33:22.855
McVeigh all along wanted
a necessity defense,


1641
01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:25.566
that he had no choice
but to bomb to building.


1642
01:33:25.608 --> 01:33:30.821
He did not want to claim
some widespread conspiracy,


1643
01:33:30.863 --> 01:33:35.367
which members of
the defense team wanted.


1644
01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.411
McVeigh wanted no part of that

1645
01:33:37.453 --> 01:33:40.163
because, number one,
it wasn't true


1646
01:33:40.205 --> 01:33:42.541
and, number two,

1647
01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:46.169
he did want credit
for this thing he had done.


1648
01:33:46.211 --> 01:33:51.926
And no evidence has ever
surfaced that anybody but him,


1649
01:33:51.968 --> 01:33:56.806
with-with a little bit of help
from his two Army buddies,


1650
01:33:56.847 --> 01:33:59.182
pulled this off.

1651
01:33:59.224 --> 01:34:00.851
He built this bomb.

1652
01:34:00.893 --> 01:34:06.398
He designed it, he built it,
and he was proud of that.


1653
01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.027
There was no massive conspiracy.

1654
01:34:10.069 --> 01:34:12.989
That much is clear.

1655
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:18.077
But the idea that Timothy
McVeigh was a lone killer


1656
01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:21.789
is wrong-headed because it
absolves the movement


1657
01:34:21.831 --> 01:34:23.874
from which it all sprang.

1658
01:34:23.916 --> 01:34:28.211
Timothy McVeigh
was not on his own.


1659
01:34:28.253 --> 01:34:32.508
He was a creation of the
white supremacist movement.


1660
01:34:32.549 --> 01:34:35.552
He carried The Turner Diaries
around


1661
01:34:35.594 --> 01:34:37.220
and read it to people.

1662
01:34:37.262 --> 01:34:40.683
He lived at the gun shows.

1663
01:34:40.724 --> 01:34:44.770
He met Neo-Nazis
and visited with them.


1664
01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:47.815
He was part of this movement.

1665
01:34:47.857 --> 01:34:50.776
And the idea that
there was no connection


1666
01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.903
between the white supremacist
movement


1667
01:34:52.945 --> 01:34:57.074
and the events in Oklahoma City
is patently false.


1668
01:34:57.116 --> 01:35:02.245
There was a strong connection,
and it was a deep connection.


1669
01:35:04.915 --> 01:35:06.500
When the verdict was read,

1670
01:35:06.542 --> 01:35:08.502
McVeigh's demeanor
didn't change at all.


1671
01:35:08.544 --> 01:35:10.046
He didn't even blink.

1672
01:35:10.087 --> 01:35:14.466
I think he fully expected
to get the verdict


1673
01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:17.260
and he fully expected
to get the death penalty,


1674
01:35:17.302 --> 01:35:19.638
and he expected to die

1675
01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:22.558
because I think he
wanted to be a martyr.


1676
01:35:26.562 --> 01:35:30.399
He thought he was starting
the next American Revolution.


1677
01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.903
I think he did
exactly the opposite,


1678
01:35:33.944 --> 01:35:38.115
because he showed the human face

1679
01:35:38.157 --> 01:35:43.328
of what it really
means to attack a government,


1680
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:45.164
a government of the people.

1681
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.627
We were the government.

1682
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:52.588
We weren't bad guys.

1683
01:35:52.629 --> 01:36:00.679
We were mothers and fathers
and daughters and sons


1684
01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:05.059
and grandparents
who had a job to do.


1685
01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:10.940
Supposedly you don't have
job satisfaction


1686
01:36:10.981 --> 01:36:13.067
if you work for the government.

1687
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:17.071
I never heard that type of talk
in our office.


1688
01:36:17.113 --> 01:36:19.280
We were very proud
of what we did.


1689
01:36:30.042 --> 01:36:33.670
Death penalty is...

1690
01:36:33.712 --> 01:36:36.090
would you call it an oxymoron?

1691
01:36:36.132 --> 01:36:40.343
Death is not a penalty,
it's an escape.


1692
01:36:40.385 --> 01:36:42.138
They treat me like a trophy,

1693
01:36:42.179 --> 01:36:45.015
like they've got me, they're
gonna kill me, "We've won."


1694
01:36:45.057 --> 01:36:47.601
They didn't win.

1695
01:36:47.643 --> 01:36:51.939
168-1.

1696
01:37:06.912 --> 01:37:10.082
He died without a word.

1697
01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:12.375
There was no pain.

1698
01:37:12.417 --> 01:37:14.837
There was no regret.

1699
01:37:14.878 --> 01:37:16.839
Because I looked into his eyes

1700
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.382
before they were closed
that last time,


1701
01:37:19.424 --> 01:37:24.387
and saw the same deep anger
and resentment and rage


1702
01:37:24.429 --> 01:37:29.643
that I had seen in that trial
several years before.


1703
01:37:33.438 --> 01:37:35.732
Justice was served.

1704
01:37:35.774 --> 01:37:37.776
That don't bring them back.

1705
01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:39.945
It just won't bring them back.

1706
01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:42.906
But it closes a door
on that chapter,


1707
01:37:42.948 --> 01:37:44.407
and that's exactly
what happened


1708
01:37:44.449 --> 01:37:48.245
when they lowered the boom
down on Timothy McVeigh.


1709
01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:56.086
We didn't go to the execution.

1710
01:37:56.128 --> 01:37:59.173
We had no time to worry
about that.


1711
01:38:01.342 --> 01:38:05.428
Our total focus, regardless
of whatever it took,


1712
01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:06.680
was our children.

1713
01:38:06.722 --> 01:38:09.390
Our children and our family.

1714
01:38:11.476 --> 01:38:14.313
We were very blessed.

1715
01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:17.440
But it's been hard for us.

1716
01:38:17.482 --> 01:38:21.570
I mean to watch Brandon
struggle, as he's struggled,


1717
01:38:21.611 --> 01:38:23.864
for the last 20 years.

1718
01:38:23.906 --> 01:38:28.327
Faith, family, and friends--

1719
01:38:28.369 --> 01:38:32.664
that's how we survived
through all of this.


1720
01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:36.293
But also it makes me
wonder why a little bit.


1721
01:38:36.335 --> 01:38:38.461
I mean, I don't question
it all the time,


1722
01:38:38.503 --> 01:38:41.340
but sometimes I question why.

1723
01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:46.136
And I do have a little bit
of the survivor guilt


1724
01:38:46.178 --> 01:38:50.431
that my children survived
and some of the others didn't.


1725
01:38:56.397 --> 01:39:03.279
I still have hope that no one
ever again becomes so enraged


1726
01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.950
with hatred and prejudice
and judgment


1727
01:39:07.991 --> 01:39:14.497
that they think the only thing
to do is to kill


1728
01:39:14.539 --> 01:39:17.500
and harm other people.

1729
01:39:17.542 --> 01:39:23.382
I have hope that through
all of this


1730
01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:28.971
that love is stronger
than any terrorist attack.


1731
01:39:31.556 --> 01:39:34.768
I have hope that that would
never happen again.
