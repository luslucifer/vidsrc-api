1
00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:24.240
There'll always be
the argument


2
00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:26.842
that video games
are meant to be played for fun.


3
00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:30.542
Believe me,
some of it's a lot of fun.


4
00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:33.208
Video games are meant
to be played at home,


5
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.910
relaxing on a couch
amongst friends.


6
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.442
And they are, and that's fun.

7
00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.374
But competitive gaming,

8
00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:44.208
when you wanna attach
your name to a world record,


9
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.076
when you want your name
written into history,


10
00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.307
you have to pay the price.

11
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.542
With this, it's just
like me and the machine.


12
00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:55.577
l can--lt doesn't matter if you,
you know--lf you let me down


13
00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:58.342
or someone else,
it doesn't come through.


14
00:00:58.373 --> 00:01:01.242
l can always go out there.
l'm in control.


15
00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:16.474
And l'm glad
you touch on this.


16
00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:17.974
Do we have enough tape?
This is important.


17
00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:21.575
Everybody, even Grandma,

18
00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:27.078
games--meaning checkers, cards,
if not now, in the past.


19
00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:29.107
Show me even
a freakin' nun or a hermit


20
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.808
who hasn't done cards
or checkers.


21
00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:39.076
l don't drink. l don't smoke.
l don't do drugs.


22
00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:41.507
l play video games,

23
00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.709
which l think is far superior
an addiction


24
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.941
than any of those other ones.

25
00:01:50.906 --> 00:01:52.741
l wanted to be a hero.

26
00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:54.841
l wanted to be the center
of attention.


27
00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:56.941
l wanted the glory.
l wanted the fame.


28
00:01:56.973 --> 00:01:58.407
l wanted the prem girls
come at me and say,


29
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.475
''Hi. l see that you're good
at Centipede.''


30
00:02:02.973 --> 00:02:04.874
l had somebody draw
an analogy for me once


31
00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:06.874
that l always remembered.

32
00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:11.176
The top French pilot in World
War l shot down 24 enemy planes.


33
00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:15.942
The top American pilot--
you don't know his name, do you?


34
00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:18.775
Nobody does.
But it's Eddie Rickenbacker.


35
00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:21.909
Shot down 26 enemy planes.

36
00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.708
The German Ace, the Red Baron.

37
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.675
Everyone knows
who the Red Baron is.


38
00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:29.376
That's 'cause he shot down

39
00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:32.342
l mean, he was the best.

40
00:02:32.373 --> 00:02:36.944
There's just--There's a level
of difference between people,


41
00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:39.108
and it translates
into some games.


42
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.443
Donkey Hong and Pac-Man
and Ms. Pac-Man


43
00:02:51.473 --> 00:02:53.508
and Galaga and Defender,

44
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.009
these are the games
that caught the public eye.


45
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.809
These are the games
people cared about.


46
00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:02.810
And so if you wanna be known
as being world-class,


47
00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.241
you gotta master
one of those games.


48
00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:06.041
l like the simplicity of it,

49
00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:07.073
and that's what
you'll probably hear


50
00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:09.241
from a lot of people
that like retro games


51
00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:10.807
is that it's the simplicity.

52
00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:15.144
Those games challenge
eye-hand coordination,


53
00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:17.708
mind-body coordination,
fast reaction time,


54
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.608
and comprehensive thinking,

55
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.009
on a level
that modern games don't.


56
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.643
Memorization and
pattern recognition is key.


57
00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:27.107
Because for you
to get a single point further


58
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.141
in an old game
from the early eighties


59
00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:30.874
meant a tremendous increase
of skill.


60
00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:33.208
lf you do not know
the next pattern coming up


61
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.643
in a Tron light-cycle event,
you will lose your life.


62
00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:39.308
Only the die-hards
who, for some reason,


63
00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.609
really love those games,
continue to stick with them.


64
00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:51.742
But what we've done is had the
mayor tie off the entire street


65
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.374
so that LiFe magazine
could come to town


66
00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:56.041
and photograph the world's
greatest video game players,


67
00:03:56.073 --> 00:03:57.073
who've been flown in

68
00:03:57.106 --> 00:04:00.309
especially for
this LiFe photographic session.


69
00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.742
All these great superstars
are coming from North Carolina,


70
00:04:02.773 --> 00:04:05.275
California, Canada,
many other places,


71
00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:08.342
to be photographed
as the official world champions


72
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:09.741
on many different games.

73
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.210
That was the first time
two world-class players


74
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.343
went head-to-head for
a competition was LiFe magazine.


75
00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:19.741
_
Without a doubt
l met players


76
00:04:19.773 --> 00:04:22.008
that were amongst the best
in the world


77
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.776
and maybe even would say
or do whatever they could


78
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.375
to make people believe
they were the best in the world.


79
00:04:27.406 --> 00:04:28.774
Well, at that time,

80
00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.974
he was the world record holder
on Centipede.


81
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:32.507
But also at that time,

82
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.708
he was the world record holder
on Donkey Hong.


83
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.575
But we didn't know that,
because someone else


84
00:04:36.606 --> 00:04:38.541
was invited there
from Hansas City


85
00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:41.042
who, because of a claim
they had made,


86
00:04:41.073 --> 00:04:45.043
it was presumed that they
were the Donkey Hong champion.


87
00:04:45.073 --> 00:04:48.609
Donkey Hong was the one
that l first lied about.


88
00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.775
But he had submitted
a bogus score,


89
00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.774
and l finally met him there
at LiFe magazine,


90
00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:55.041
and l finally sat down
to play him.


91
00:04:55.073 --> 00:04:57.809
We had not been there long,
and Bill said,


92
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.042
''Come on. Let's play.''

93
00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:03.408
l went in the arcade
and sat down with Donkey Hong,


94
00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.408
and l beat him to a pulp.

95
00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.008
Well, l was better
than the best.


96
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.809
And l got--
l got 200,OOO against Bill.


97
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.310
Bill got 800,OOO
on his first man in that game.


98
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.042
He shellacked me.
He shellacked me.


99
00:05:16.073 --> 00:05:18.775
Basically, he walked away
with his head down and humbled,


100
00:05:18.806 --> 00:05:20.507
and that brought him
to the truth.


101
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.808
And from there,
we worked together.


102
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:27.208
Well, the Bible--
Proverbs says,


103
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.042
''As iron sharpens iron,
so one man sharpens another.''


104
00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:31.607
Bill made me a better person,

105
00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.679
and did so
by basically making me confess.


106
00:05:37.706 --> 00:05:40.775
l've pointed out to Steve
that he's the person he is today


107
00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:43.175
because he came under the wrath
of Bill Mitchell.


108
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.542
ln front of the 19 top players
in the nation,


109
00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:49.041
actually North America,

110
00:05:49.073 --> 00:05:51.909
he did the highest
Donkey Hong score possible


111
00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.276
and also found out that the game
ends on the 22nd board.


112
00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:25.808
Since, l so-called
debuted on the scene


113
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.309
at LiFe magazine in 1982,

114
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.444
there hasn't been anybody
who's played even close.


115
00:06:32.473 --> 00:06:34.808
When Billy Mitchell
walks into an arcade,


116
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.008
you know, everything stops.

117
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.374
There's electricity
around Billy Mitchell.


118
00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:39.974
Everybody wants
to crowd around him.


119
00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:41.307
Everybody wants to see him.

120
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.742
You know, everything about him
is perfect, you know?


121
00:06:43.773 --> 00:06:46.675
Billy is just that person.
You know, he wants to represent.


122
00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:47.873
lf you could hack
into the machine


123
00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:50.308
and program it to play itself,

124
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.774
you couldn't
even program it that well.


125
00:06:51.806 --> 00:06:54.575
There's a glamour to Billy.
There's a specialness to Billy.


126
00:06:54.606 --> 00:06:57.308
He was the first. He was
the first great, great player.


127
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.808
The fact of the matter is,

128
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.544
Bill is the best classic
arcade gamer of our era.


129
00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:05.808
lt's actually carved
a part of my personality


130
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.474
that benefits me every day.

131
00:07:07.506 --> 00:07:12.077
l mean, a burning passion
never to settle for what l have


132
00:07:12.106 --> 00:07:14.341
in my business, in my family.

133
00:07:14.373 --> 00:07:16.742
That's what competitive gaming
has done for me.


134
00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:18.508
He's a winner.

135
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.108
Billy Mitchell
is absolutely a winner.


136
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.109
lt's sort of like
being in a maze,


137
00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.376
but everything you see
is actually sauce.


138
00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:27.907
The all-around
most-seasoned person


139
00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:31.376
in the hot saucelchicken wing
industry--yeah, for sure, me.


140
00:07:31.806 --> 00:07:35.075
There's a production end of it.
There's the preparation.


141
00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:36.774
When there's the sales
end of it,


142
00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:39.441
there's not somebody
who encompasses


143
00:07:39.473 --> 00:07:41.274
all of those areas like me
that l've ever met.


144
00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:43.474
He sells his hot sauce,
he sells himself.


145
00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:47.376
Because he's so charming
and such a good ambassador


146
00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:49.641
for all gaming
because he's positive,


147
00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:50.974
there's no reason,
in my opinion,


148
00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:53.541
why Billy Mitchell couldn't end
up on a Wheaties box someday.


149
00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:05.309
The video arcade classic
has finally been conquered.


150
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.608
On July 4,
at a New Hampshire arcade,


151
00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:11.043
34-year-old Billy Mitchell
became the first person


152
00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:15.277
to master Pac-Man by recording
the first ever perfect game.


153
00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:18.409
#  Billy Mitchell
primo joystick dude #


154
00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:22.076
#  Amazing in the maze,
he ain't gonna lose #


155
00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:24.141
To get through every board,
getting every dot,


156
00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:26.942
every energizer,
every ghost that's applicable,


157
00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.942
to reach to the final 256th
screen without dying?


158
00:08:29.973 --> 00:08:31.641
That's--lt's impressive
in its own right.


159
00:08:31.673 --> 00:08:33.341
The success of this
was not just because


160
00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:35.174
someone got
a perfect Pac-Man score,


161
00:08:35.206 --> 00:08:38.208
but because Billy Mitchell
got a perfect Pac-Man score.


162
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.743
#  Blue man in the corridor
singing the blues #


163
00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:43.808
#  A perfect game goes down #

164
00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:49.609
#  Billy's on the move #

165
00:08:53.506 --> 00:08:57.076
lf l have all this good fortune,
if everything's rollin' my way,


166
00:08:57.106 --> 00:08:59.675
if all these balls
have bounced in my favor...


167
00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.674
there is some poor bastard
out there


168
00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:05.108
who's getting
the screws put to him.


169
00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:19.809
When l got laid off
and l had time on my hands,


170
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.441
l was thinking,
''Well, what can l do


171
00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:25.276
''to kind of feel like
l have control of something,''


172
00:09:25.306 --> 00:09:29.309
so l looked at Twin Galaxies.

173
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.476
l just--well, l typed in
Donkey Hong world record,


174
00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:36.443
and some spreadsheet came up,
and l saw what the score was.


175
00:09:36.473 --> 00:09:43.313
lt was held by Billy Mitchell,
and it was, like, 874,OOO.


176
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.241
l go, ''Hey, l can beat that.''

177
00:09:49.306 --> 00:09:50.540
Almost there.

178
00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:52.374
l mean, l'm not the kind of wife
that's needy


179
00:09:52.406 --> 00:09:53.807
that l need him sitting on
the couch with me every night.


180
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840
l don't need that.

181
00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:57.208
What l need is him in the house
helping me with the kids


182
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.874
or l need him
being with the kids.


183
00:09:58.906 --> 00:10:00.807
So he would want
to come out here and play,


184
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.842
and that would drive me crazy,
'cause he is definitely OCD.


185
00:10:03.873 --> 00:10:05.341
When he is obsessed
on something,


186
00:10:05.373 --> 00:10:08.075
he is so focused,
and l have to be like, ''Hello.''


187
00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:11.309
Um, so then l just said,
''You have to do it at night.''


188
00:10:15.806 --> 00:10:17.774
ls level 2 easy?

189
00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:22.174
Yeah, it's prem easy.

190
00:10:23.973 --> 00:10:28.310
l've dreamed of, you know,
being a musician for a living.


191
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.574
That's what my dream was.

192
00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:32.241
He was brought up to be
that he was smart,


193
00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:34.008
he was an athlete,
he was talented,


194
00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:37.943
and for whatever reason,
he could never get those to fit.


195
00:10:44.073 --> 00:10:48.477
Steve was one of the original
starving grunge bands


196
00:10:48.506 --> 00:10:50.307
here in Seattle,
just starving.


197
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.376
The only people who came
to see him was us.


198
00:10:53.406 --> 00:10:55.141
With his music,
it's almost like


199
00:10:55.173 --> 00:10:57.408
he didn't want people to know
he was doing it.


200
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.675
He's a total paradox that way.

201
00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:05.044
#  l've been looking so long
at these pictures of you #


202
00:11:05.073 --> 00:11:07.842
He has maybe a little social
hang-ups here and there


203
00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:10.542
that, um--
that haven't allowed him


204
00:11:10.573 --> 00:11:12.975
to be as successful
on one end as in other ends.


205
00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:18.677
They got to the state finals,
and Steve couldn't pitch.


206
00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:20.741
l've probably seen Steve
with tears in his eyes


207
00:11:20.773 --> 00:11:22.141
more than any other guy l know,

208
00:11:22.173 --> 00:11:24.808
uh, because of the frustration
that would build in him.


209
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.274
And half the time,
it was on the pitcher's mound.


210
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.709
He had hurt his arm.
l had pitched him too much.


211
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.442
l was the manager of the team.

212
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.976
lt was a chance for him to shine
in front of thousands of people.


213
00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:40.008
That killed him--
that he couldn't pitch


214
00:11:40.039 --> 00:11:42.742
because it's that
competitiveness in him.


215
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.310
#  And we kissed
as the sky fell in #


216
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.508
#  Holding you close #

217
00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:51.975
#  How l always held close #

218
00:11:52.006 --> 00:11:57.945
l envisioned him
as, uh, an engineer at Boeing.


219
00:11:59.006 --> 00:12:02.542
My dad worked at Boeing
for 30 some years,


220
00:12:02.573 --> 00:12:05.676
and the plan was to go to Boeing
and be a lifer,


221
00:12:05.706 --> 00:12:07.207
as they call 'em.

222
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.641
But, um, things didn't work out.

223
00:12:08.673 --> 00:12:10.241
l don't know if he told you
that he was laid off


224
00:12:10.273 --> 00:12:12.475
the day we signed papers
on our house. Yeah.


225
00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:14.574
#  And you finally found #

226
00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:19.410
#  All your courage
to let it all go #


227
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.375
He never has quite reached
that pinnacle.


228
00:12:26.406 --> 00:12:28.941
He never quite,
in any of his endeavors,


229
00:12:28.973 --> 00:12:32.076
was regaled
as the number-one guy,


230
00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:34.274
the guy that was better
than the rest


231
00:12:34.306 --> 00:12:36.141
and was on top of the mountain.

232
00:12:36.173 --> 00:12:38.308
Oh, he's just come up short
in a lot of things in his life,


233
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.076
and l just think, you know,

234
00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:43.074
nobody wants to do that
all the time.


235
00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:45.241
#  Lost in the cold #

236
00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:51.045
#  You were always so lost
in the dark #


237
00:12:51.073 --> 00:12:53.542
#  Remembering you #

238
00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:56.809
lt has my high score saved
on there from last.


239
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.375
#  Slow drowned,
you were angels #


240
00:12:59.406 --> 00:13:02.509
#  So much more than everything #

241
00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:04.875
#  Hold for the last time #

242
00:13:04.906 --> 00:13:07.808
#  Then slip away quietly #

243
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.509
What plunged me
into competitive gaming,


244
00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.976
never to come out,
was Donkey Hong.


245
00:13:14.006 --> 00:13:17.376
Donkey Hong. Well, that was
the first ever Mario game.


246
00:13:17.406 --> 00:13:19.508
The whole thing
is a construction site.


247
00:13:19.539 --> 00:13:21.541
lt's all these girders
and elevators with ladders


248
00:13:21.573 --> 00:13:23.308
going from one girder
to the next.


249
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.910
The whole goal, the whole time
is to get past the obstacles


250
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.777
that Hong is throwing at you
and get--get the girl.


251
00:13:30.806 --> 00:13:33.608
Well, Donkey Hong, without
question, is the hardest game.


252
00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:36.542
lt's ridiculously difficult
on the first screen.


253
00:13:38.406 --> 00:13:40.841
Donkey Hong
is releasing these barrels.


254
00:13:40.873 --> 00:13:42.241
You got to jump
over the barrels.


255
00:13:42.273 --> 00:13:43.440
You gotta duck
the barrels.


256
00:13:43.473 --> 00:13:47.109
You can grab a hammer
and hammer the barrels.


257
00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.809
Okay, the secret
about the barrel board


258
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.142
is you can actually
control the barrels.


259
00:13:52.173 --> 00:13:53.908
Right above this ladder,

260
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.275
you'll do a quick left,
and then a hard right turn.


261
00:13:56.306 --> 00:13:59.008
See how it went down?
Went down again.


262
00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:01.308
You gotta get past
all the barrels, the fireballs,


263
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.340
get up the ladders.

264
00:14:02.373 --> 00:14:04.341
And as soon as you get to her,

265
00:14:04.373 --> 00:14:07.008
Donkey Hong takes her away
to the next level.


266
00:14:09.973 --> 00:14:12.442
The average Donkey Hong game
doesn't last a minute.


267
00:14:12.473 --> 00:14:14.274
lt's absolute brutality.

268
00:14:14.306 --> 00:14:16.274
Each of the 18 elevator boards

269
00:14:16.306 --> 00:14:19.475
represents the greatest
challenge in video game playing.


270
00:14:19.506 --> 00:14:21.474
The average gamer on Donkey Hong

271
00:14:21.506 --> 00:14:24.942
will never get past
the third elevator stage.


272
00:14:24.973 --> 00:14:27.575
Just the slightest touch from
one of these springs, kills you.


273
00:14:27.606 --> 00:14:30.408
There's no hammer for them.
There's no way to defeat them.


274
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.842
All you can do is avoid them.
That's it.


275
00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.708
And the secret
to the third elevators


276
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.477
is knowing which spring
to go on,


277
00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:41.141
and then knowing which spring
to move up the ladder on,


278
00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:43.642
and recognizing
when you must retreat.


279
00:14:43.673 --> 00:14:46.942
lf you don't time it just
exactly right, you will die.


280
00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:50.576
lt boils down
to hardcore skill.


281
00:14:50.606 --> 00:14:53.842
So l go on that one because it
line up with the dashed line.


282
00:14:53.873 --> 00:14:57.443
Now l'm waiting for one to line
up with the solid line there.


283
00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.941
l have said from the day
l met Steve


284
00:15:00.973 --> 00:15:03.842
that his talent
is in his hands.


285
00:15:03.873 --> 00:15:06.175
He pitched.
He was at basketball.


286
00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:07.774
He's a phenomenal drawer,

287
00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:09.574
and if you ever seen
pictures that he's drawn,


288
00:15:09.606 --> 00:15:11.808
but he's very artistic.

289
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.175
lt's operating on some
subconscious level with him,


290
00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:15.640
l think.

291
00:15:15.673 --> 00:15:19.410
When we were driving to Hansas
or whatever, family trips,


292
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.241
he'd sit there,
and for a hundred miles


293
00:15:21.273 --> 00:15:23.875
would bang his head, you know,

294
00:15:23.906 --> 00:15:26.108
four--four time
against the back of the seat.


295
00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:29.276
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

296
00:15:29.306 --> 00:15:31.675
Well, l've often thought that
he maybe is a little autistic,


297
00:15:31.706 --> 00:15:34.041
that he's just
that obsessive compulsive,


298
00:15:34.073 --> 00:15:36.341
'cause he would get
something in his mind.


299
00:15:36.373 --> 00:15:37.941
He wanted to play drums,

300
00:15:37.973 --> 00:15:39.908
and l don't even know
where he got that idea.


301
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:45.779
This is Derek's drum set,
and it's not too bad.


302
00:15:45.806 --> 00:15:48.975
lt's--lt does the trick.

303
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.711
The actual game play involves
so much eye-hand coordination,


304
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.041
mind-body coordination,

305
00:16:33.073 --> 00:16:35.875
fast reaction time,
and comprehensive thinking.


306
00:16:35.906 --> 00:16:38.708
Such a high level
of precise execution.


307
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.974
So much skill...

308
00:16:42.506 --> 00:16:44.374
involves so much learning.

309
00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:53.544
You have to have
deep comprehensive intelligence.


310
00:16:56.773 --> 00:16:59.008
Um, for years and years,
it was believed


311
00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:03.110
that Billy's record of 874,OOO
in 1982


312
00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:05.509
was really the highest score
anyone would ever get.


313
00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:07.808
And in fact, some of us
have played this game


314
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.108
every day or every week
or every month since then,


315
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.407
and no one's
gotten close to that.


316
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.442
No one across
that big length of time


317
00:17:14.473 --> 00:17:18.510
will ever be able to beat
his world record.


318
00:17:32.906 --> 00:17:36.409
Derek, look. You're on TV.

319
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.508
See yourself? Say, ''hi.''

320
00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:39.941
No.

321
00:17:39.973 --> 00:17:41.641
l was havin'
the game of my life.


322
00:17:41.673 --> 00:17:47.178
l was--Think l got 600,OOO,
uh, and l hadn't died yet.


323
00:17:47.206 --> 00:17:50.275
And when l started
hearing some noises


324
00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:52.341
coming down the stairs,
screaming--


325
00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.107
And it's all on tape,
and l--


326
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.709
That's the tape l had to send in
to--to Twin Galaxies.


327
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.808
Everything l'm all about

328
00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:37.841
by practicing
transcendental meditation,


329
00:18:37.873 --> 00:18:39.474
and l like to see
that mirrored


330
00:18:39.506 --> 00:18:42.609
in the way l apply myself
to the video game world,


331
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.575
in that
l seek to find champions


332
00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:46.741
and watch them grow
and become even greater


333
00:18:46.773 --> 00:18:50.576
as they begin to unfold more and
more of their full potential,


334
00:18:50.606 --> 00:18:52.240
which is what we do
when we do TM.


335
00:18:52.273 --> 00:18:57.244
lf Walter, through all these
years, all the way since 1982,


336
00:18:57.273 --> 00:19:00.943
hadn't continued
as a labor of love,


337
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.408
then there would be
no central organization


338
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.108
for competitive
video game playing.


339
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.376
Why do we do it?
Because we actually love this.


340
00:19:08.406 --> 00:19:10.407
Because we enjoy this.
We're fascinated by this.


341
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.974
There's just something
in our genes


342
00:19:12.006 --> 00:19:15.209
that my group, Twin Galaxies,
raising the banner high


343
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.242
to do this and move--move
organized video game playing


344
00:19:18.273 --> 00:19:19.273
into the future.

345
00:19:19.306 --> 00:19:20.607
Walter opened the door

346
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.076
to truly--
l was gonna say international,


347
00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:26.942
but at the very least,
national competitive gaming.


348
00:19:26.973 --> 00:19:28.908
We just happened to call it
Twin Galaxies.


349
00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.175
The name burst into my brain.

350
00:19:31.206 --> 00:19:33.274
Walter Day didn't do that
by accident.


351
00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:37.109
Didn't get lucky.
He--He created his own empire.


352
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.075
Join us again
for Video Game News Update.


353
00:19:39.106 --> 00:19:40.106
l'm Walter Day

354
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.175
at the Twin Galaxies
international scoreboard.


355
00:19:42.206 --> 00:19:43.507
lt's been a wearying thing
being the scorekeeper


356
00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:45.541
because everybody picks on me,
you know?


357
00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:48.709
'Cause l'm the man, you know?
l'm a police officer.


358
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.776
Video games need a guy
like Bush, who will say,


359
00:19:51.806 --> 00:19:53.274
''Look, this is the way
we're gonna do it.


360
00:19:53.306 --> 00:19:56.709
This is the rule, and if you
don't like it, tough.''


361
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.108
You've got to have that.

362
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.942
lf you didn't have that
in the NFL, who'd win?


363
00:20:00.973 --> 00:20:02.974
How do you declare a champion
unless there are rules?


364
00:20:03.006 --> 00:20:04.707
And if you break 'em,
you lose.


365
00:20:17.506 --> 00:20:22.177
The best features about him
are also his biggest downfall.


366
00:20:22.206 --> 00:20:25.042
People can just run over him
because he's so nice.


367
00:20:25.073 --> 00:20:29.243
Twin Galaxies survives
because people like Walter,


368
00:20:29.273 --> 00:20:33.210
people like Robert Mruczek,
people like me,


369
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.011
who participate all for
a passion of competitive gaming.


370
00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:39.274
Nobody draws a paycheck.

371
00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:42.375
l don't see details.
l see big pictures, you know?


372
00:20:42.406 --> 00:20:45.509
l see the big concept that lies
behind the whole issue,


373
00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:46.641
and then l tweak that.

374
00:20:46.673 --> 00:20:48.875
l can't do details and details.

375
00:20:48.906 --> 00:20:51.742
Twin Galaxies needs a staff
of detail-oriented people


376
00:20:51.773 --> 00:20:52.807
like Robert Mruczek.

377
00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:55.975
Um, anything
that's unexplainable,


378
00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.707
out of the ordinary,

379
00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.241
we have to keep our eyes
out for.


380
00:20:59.273 --> 00:21:00.974
That's not to say
we're infallible.


381
00:21:01.006 --> 00:21:04.976
When l have to watch that pile
of eight tapes over there


382
00:21:05.006 --> 00:21:07.842
for Dwayne Richard's
two-day nibbler performance,


383
00:21:07.873 --> 00:21:09.841
that's 48 straight hours
of paying attention,


384
00:21:09.873 --> 00:21:11.708
to make sure that he's doing
everything correctly.


385
00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:14.541
Package from
the Metroid team in Brazil,


386
00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:16.107
some Atari 2600 records.

387
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.407
Gotta watch that.

388
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.809
These things take time
to veri_.


389
00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:21.775
And l have to look
at every single one of these.


390
00:21:21.806 --> 00:21:23.541
Like l showed you over here.

391
00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:26.676
This is just 200 videotapes.
That's nothing.


392
00:21:26.706 --> 00:21:28.741
This is the real stuff
that l have to do.


393
00:21:28.773 --> 00:21:33.043
l see world's records in my room
set just about every single day.


394
00:21:33.073 --> 00:21:34.707
Some people think
a world's record


395
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.874
is what's set at the Olympics

396
00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:37.941
or at the end
of a baseball season.


397
00:21:37.973 --> 00:21:41.443
l see this every single day,
and not just sometimes once.


398
00:21:41.473 --> 00:21:42.473
lt's exciting.

399
00:21:42.506 --> 00:21:43.540
Derek!

400
00:21:43.573 --> 00:21:47.843
- Stop playing Donkey Hong!
- You stop it!


401
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.176
- Stop playing Donkey Hong!
- Maybe.


402
00:21:53.206 --> 00:21:54.540
Yeah, that was close.

403
00:21:54.573 --> 00:21:56.241
That was actually good.

404
00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:58.341
You stop it!

405
00:21:58.373 --> 00:22:00.675
Stop it!

406
00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:02.774
Derek, stop it. No.

407
00:22:02.806 --> 00:22:05.708
Stop playing Donkey Hong.

408
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.408
- Derek?
- Stop playing Donkey Hong.


409
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.742
Derek, l'm gonna throw away
your rest if you don't stop it.


410
00:22:09.773 --> 00:22:10.773
Derek!

411
00:22:10.806 --> 00:22:12.107
Somebody has
accomplished something


412
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.307
that not only l can't do,

413
00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:15.175
that nobody else
has ever been done before,


414
00:22:15.206 --> 00:22:16.941
and it's exciting
to see that firsthand.


415
00:22:16.973 --> 00:22:19.241
That's how you play Donkey Hong.

416
00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.741
New world record.

417
00:22:24.406 --> 00:22:25.406
Welcome back.

418
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.975
Bill Gates isn't necessarily
the most famous name


419
00:22:28.006 --> 00:22:29.140
in Redmond tonight.

420
00:22:29.173 --> 00:22:32.142
Coming up, meet the man
who's at the top of his game.


421
00:22:32.173 --> 00:22:34.074
A Donkey Hong world record.

422
00:22:34.106 --> 00:22:37.843
He was a big celebrity there
for a bit in Seattle.


423
00:22:37.873 --> 00:22:39.040
l was just doing it.

424
00:22:39.073 --> 00:22:41.175
Just thought it would be
a neat achievement.


425
00:22:41.206 --> 00:22:44.943
l didn't think it would ever
blow up to be a big story.


426
00:22:44.973 --> 00:22:47.475
He goes, ''You're the first lady
of Donkey Hong.''


427
00:22:47.506 --> 00:22:49.507
l'm like, ''Oh, my God.''

428
00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:53.076
Even though it was
this silly video game thing,


429
00:22:53.106 --> 00:22:56.175
it's not many of us
that have a buddy


430
00:22:56.206 --> 00:22:59.442
who's the best in the world
at something.


431
00:22:59.473 --> 00:23:01.908
That was a godsend to him
in the last couple of years


432
00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.641
to get him through.

433
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:07.009
Like it might be was like
a safe haven for him, yeah.


434
00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:08.808
#  No equality #

435
00:23:08.839 --> 00:23:09.907
#  Be still #

436
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.642
#  l will not accept defeat #

437
00:23:12.673 --> 00:23:14.608
#  l will have you #

438
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.042
#  Yes, l will have you #

439
00:23:17.073 --> 00:23:18.741
#  l will find a way #

440
00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:20.708
#  And l will have you #

441
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.374
We're at Hamiakin Junior High,

442
00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:25.609
and l'm here in my seventh and
eight grade science classroom.


443
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.907
lt's my first year
at teaching,


444
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.576
so it's been a challenge,
but very enjoyable so far.


445
00:23:30.606 --> 00:23:37.079
Sand, soil, and the cornstarch.

446
00:23:37.106 --> 00:23:41.043
l went to, uh, the city university,
which had a program and--


447
00:23:41.073 --> 00:23:43.809
One year,
you had a master's degree,


448
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:46.342
so we roughed it out
for a year.


449
00:23:46.373 --> 00:23:50.143
And here l am today,
so it finally worked out.


450
00:23:50.173 --> 00:23:53.442
lt's fun, and he's not making it
so it's like,


451
00:23:53.473 --> 00:23:56.142
''This is science.
This is boring.''


452
00:23:56.173 --> 00:23:57.607
He talks to us about stuff

453
00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.742
that's not just like homework
and schoolwork


454
00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:00.773
and school and stuff.

455
00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:02.507
Okay, here is--

456
00:24:03.473 --> 00:24:07.243
My history with Donkey Hong is,
l have the world record.


457
00:24:07.273 --> 00:24:10.743
Okay, l didn't know
it was a world record.


458
00:24:10.773 --> 00:24:14.276
lt's for Donkey Hong, is it?
Oh, my gosh.


459
00:24:14.306 --> 00:24:16.274
There is like--lt's...

460
00:24:16.306 --> 00:24:17.874
all the science teachers here
are weird.


461
00:24:17.906 --> 00:24:19.841
Steve deserves
a lot of credit for that


462
00:24:19.873 --> 00:24:21.207
because he also...

463
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.176
He also broke the record
on Donkey Hong Jr.


464
00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:27.842
So he--he took two--He took two
of Billy's titles,


465
00:24:27.873 --> 00:24:28.974
like, right away from him.

466
00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:31.441
And l don't mean to sound,
you know, crude or anything.


467
00:24:31.473 --> 00:24:33.908
But he did. He did.
Officially, he did.


468
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.076
That was the last world record
that Bill ever had.


469
00:24:37.106 --> 00:24:38.173
That was the last one to go.

470
00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:40.441
He had five world records
in 1985,


471
00:24:40.473 --> 00:24:45.244
and he had the Donkey Hong, and
then Steve Wiebe took it away.


472
00:24:45.273 --> 00:24:47.975
lt's far more difficult
when you're on top,


473
00:24:48.006 --> 00:24:50.775
anybody who's on top,
to stay on top.


474
00:24:50.806 --> 00:24:53.308
Billy's got a lot of things
up his sleeve.


475
00:24:53.339 --> 00:24:56.676
He likes to keep quiet
in situations like that.


476
00:24:56.706 --> 00:24:59.809
So, you know, somebody may have
taken him down now,


477
00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:02.375
but behind closed doors,
Billy's got something planned.


478
00:25:02.406 --> 00:25:03.406
That's Billy Mitchell.

479
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.575
On my phone, it says,
''Never surrender.''


480
00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:07.774
lf somebody beat his record,

481
00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:10.074
he'd have a plan
to beat it back.


482
00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:11.207
l'm sure.

483
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.108
The worse thing
that could happen


484
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.477
would be to give somebody
the credibility of a score


485
00:25:17.506 --> 00:25:20.242
that doesn't deserve it.

486
00:25:20.273 --> 00:25:23.809
But even far worse than that
would be to deny somebody


487
00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:27.310
the credibility
when they deserved it.


488
00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:29.542
lf l'm not there, l don't know.

489
00:25:29.573 --> 00:25:30.941
Get this.

490
00:25:30.973 --> 00:25:33.241
l came home one day
and there was two people


491
00:25:33.273 --> 00:25:36.709
in my garage
Iooking at my machine.


492
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.742
They wanted to--
They're spies.


493
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.444
lt was a Saturday.
It was in July or August.


494
00:25:44.473 --> 00:25:46.775
And my mom was here 'cause l was
getting ready to go to work.


495
00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:48.307
And these guys
knocked on the door,


496
00:25:48.339 --> 00:25:50.742
and l don't think l knew
they were gonna be here at all.


497
00:25:50.773 --> 00:25:53.408
And they said that
who they were,


498
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.108
and they wanted to come in
and look at the machine.


499
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.708
And l knew l had to leave,
and l said,


500
00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.742
''l'm not comfortable
in letting you do that.


501
00:25:59.773 --> 00:26:02.842
''l have to go to work.
My mom is here.


502
00:26:02.873 --> 00:26:04.741
''Steve's gonna be home shortly.

503
00:26:04.773 --> 00:26:06.875
You just need to wait.
You just need to wait.''


504
00:26:06.906 --> 00:26:09.775
To find out
at an ultra elite level,


505
00:26:09.806 --> 00:26:11.440
whether or not a score is good,

506
00:26:11.473 --> 00:26:13.908
sometimes we have no choice
but to call in the pros.


507
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.075
Bri--Brian Huh,
the Donkey Hong player,


508
00:26:16.106 --> 00:26:17.507
went to Steve's place.

509
00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:18.641
Bill asked me to do it,

510
00:26:18.673 --> 00:26:20.374
but l didn't have time
to go do it, so Brian did it.


511
00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:23.809
Went there with one of the most
respected gamers of all time,


512
00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:25.208
Perry Rodgers,
to back him up.


513
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.476
Billy Mitchell and Twin Galaxies
asked me to, um,


514
00:26:28.506 --> 00:26:30.207
because l live
in the area near him,


515
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.975
to go investigate him.

516
00:26:32.006 --> 00:26:33.073
So we went out to his house.

517
00:26:33.106 --> 00:26:35.107
l mean, l'm the homeowner.
It's my house.


518
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.008
l'm the wife
of the Donkey Hong guy.


519
00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:38.574
They should've
respected my wishes


520
00:26:38.606 --> 00:26:41.408
and left my mom alone and not
come in, but they didn't.


521
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.543
They took apart
his Donkey Hong machine,


522
00:26:44.573 --> 00:26:46.274
and started taking pictures
of everything.


523
00:26:46.306 --> 00:26:47.607
You know, trying to look
for an excuse


524
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.375
to try to invalidate
his score.


525
00:26:49.406 --> 00:26:52.242
They saw this box

526
00:26:52.273 --> 00:26:56.043
that has Roy Shildt's
return address on it.


527
00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:57.941
So they looked over
and they said,


528
00:26:57.973 --> 00:26:59.974
''Roy Shildt? Why is
Roy Shildt's name on there?''


529
00:27:00.006 --> 00:27:03.776
Roy Shildt is the type of gamer
that would like nothing more


530
00:27:03.806 --> 00:27:06.708
than to see Twin Galaxies
get an egg on its face.


531
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:15.610
l want you to remember
that no punk bastard


532
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.543
ever got a gnarly piece
of poontang


533
00:27:19.573 --> 00:27:22.275
by being sensitive
and considerate.


534
00:27:22.306 --> 00:27:24.408
He calls himself Mr. Awesome.

535
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.075
He drives the Awesomobile
to fame and fortune,


536
00:27:27.106 --> 00:27:28.874
as he says on his web site.

537
00:27:28.906 --> 00:27:31.808
He's jealous of Billy
because Billy gets attention


538
00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:33.441
from beautiful women
wherever he goes.


539
00:27:33.473 --> 00:27:35.741
And, essentially,
he wants to be like Billy.


540
00:27:35.773 --> 00:27:39.376
l mean, l've seen the world
champion cherry pit spitter


541
00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:41.374
on the Tonight Show
with Jay Leno.


542
00:27:41.406 --> 00:27:42.840
And if that guy should be
on the Tonight Show,


543
00:27:42.873 --> 00:27:46.209
at least l can just--just be
a celebrity for a day.


544
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.475
l didn't even get that.
l got no recognition at all.


545
00:27:48.506 --> 00:27:50.407
l didn't get to be
on any television shows.


546
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.408
lt's like l--
It's like l was a ghost,


547
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.841
and l just don't feel
it's right,


548
00:27:53.873 --> 00:27:55.975
and l just want
a little recognition.


549
00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:57.874
l'm not necessarily
to become a celebrity.


550
00:27:57.906 --> 00:27:59.474
Hey, Billy.
How you doing, man?


551
00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:02.041
- How are you doing?
- Billy, how are you?


552
00:28:02.073 --> 00:28:03.441
l'm perfect.
Haven't you read?


553
00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:06.375
Twin Galaxies does a lot
to promote Billy


554
00:28:06.406 --> 00:28:08.941
'cause it's very much
to Twin Galaxies' advantage


555
00:28:08.973 --> 00:28:11.375
and very much to the whole
gaming hobby's advantage


556
00:28:11.406 --> 00:28:12.807
for Billy to become a star.

557
00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:15.842
When Walter Day
published that book in 1997,


558
00:28:15.873 --> 00:28:18.175
with all those egregious
errors in there,


559
00:28:18.206 --> 00:28:19.640
Bill Mitchell saw it.

560
00:28:19.673 --> 00:28:21.674
And he knew they were wrong.
He knew they were mistakes.


561
00:28:21.706 --> 00:28:23.774
But he tried to pretend
like they were real


562
00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:25.841
to try to take
my Missile Command score down.


563
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:29.910
Roy and l met
at California Extreme,


564
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.275
and he knew that l was--
had a capability


565
00:28:32.306 --> 00:28:33.640
of beating Billy
on Donkey Hong.


566
00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:35.107
Steve Wiebe is the one
who had unlocked


567
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.241
the secrets to Donkey Hong

568
00:28:36.273 --> 00:28:38.141
to figure out how to get
a million points.


569
00:28:38.173 --> 00:28:41.142
He offered to buy me a board,
a Donkey Hong board,


570
00:28:41.173 --> 00:28:42.941
because mine had broken.

571
00:28:42.973 --> 00:28:44.841
And l didn't have the money.

572
00:28:44.873 --> 00:28:47.775
So, you know, it was a
mutual-beneficial relationship.


573
00:28:47.806 --> 00:28:49.707
He would buy me a board.

574
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.708
l would have the opportunity
to beat Billy's record,


575
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.242
and at the same time,
l would take Billy down


576
00:28:54.273 --> 00:28:57.709
and seek
Roy's revenge on Billy.


577
00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.076
Um, and it seemed good
at the time, you know?


578
00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:02.974
And unknowing to me,
l didn't know the history


579
00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:06.576
between the bad blood
with Roy and Billy, and--


580
00:29:06.606 --> 00:29:10.142
To attempt something like this
for the sole purpose


581
00:29:10.173 --> 00:29:13.442
of taking down
one of Bill's scores,


582
00:29:13.473 --> 00:29:15.508
it's like a...a slap
in the face.


583
00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:17.241
They would say
that l somehow monkeyed


584
00:29:17.273 --> 00:29:18.841
with the board or something,
they--


585
00:29:18.873 --> 00:29:19.974
but they wouldn't have
any evidence.


586
00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:21.040
They looked at the board.

587
00:29:21.073 --> 00:29:22.707
They took the pictures
of the board,


588
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.441
and they couldn't find
anything wrong with it.


589
00:29:24.473 --> 00:29:27.609
The fact that
the right gummy substance


590
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.042
on the right chip
out of all these chips,


591
00:29:30.073 --> 00:29:34.177
in the right spot
on the right board.


592
00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:38.944
l mean, l--l--l--l have to say
there's a conspiracy here.


593
00:29:38.973 --> 00:29:42.543
Any board that's worked on
could have a problem.


594
00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:45.809
To find out
that this gamer potentially


595
00:29:45.839 --> 00:29:49.510
has a fraudulent score
has upset Billy's master plan


596
00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:50.741
for what he wanted to do.

597
00:29:50.773 --> 00:29:52.774
l mean, when you come home
and see two guys in your garage,


598
00:29:52.806 --> 00:29:53.907
and you know why--
and you've learned


599
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.007
why they're there,
and you got to--


600
00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:58.109
from a guy like Bill Mitchell,
l mean, you know,


601
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.342
who's done crazy thing
after crazy thing


602
00:30:00.373 --> 00:30:02.608
after the next crazy thing,
you know?


603
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.342
Billy Mitchell
was one of the evaluators,


604
00:30:05.373 --> 00:30:06.507
which seemed a little strange

605
00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:10.510
that the guy whose records
Steve is competing against


606
00:30:10.539 --> 00:30:14.076
is deciding whether or not
Steve's records are valid.


607
00:30:14.106 --> 00:30:17.876
Even if that board is
a completely legitimate board,


608
00:30:17.906 --> 00:30:20.174
Roy's taint on it
is too strong.


609
00:30:20.206 --> 00:30:22.608
''Roy Shildt's a liar.
Roy Shildt's a cheater.


610
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.875
''Roy Shildt's full of crap.
Roy Shildt's out to get me.


611
00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:27.742
''And he's crazy,
blah, blah, blah, blah.''


612
00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:30.408
Well, he threatened
Bill Mitchell physically.


613
00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.244
Uh, in fact, he has threatened
Bill Mitchell's life.


614
00:30:35.273 --> 00:30:38.576
No, l did not.
l did not. l did not.


615
00:30:38.606 --> 00:30:43.077
He threatened his own life
to make it look like me


616
00:30:43.106 --> 00:30:45.308
because for whatever--
to gain leverage


617
00:30:45.339 --> 00:30:47.408
with the other--
with other people, l don't know.


618
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.141
He figured-
-What he--

619
00:30:49.173 --> 00:30:51.775
What he knows that my Missile
Command score is genuine.


620
00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:54.875
No matter what l say,
it draws controversy.


621
00:30:54.906 --> 00:30:56.741
Sort of like
the abortion issue.


622
00:30:56.773 --> 00:30:59.175
lf you're for it,
you're a son of a gun.


623
00:30:59.206 --> 00:31:01.141
lf you're against it,
you're a son of a gun.


624
00:31:01.173 --> 00:31:04.843
Uh, l'm not God.
l don't have all the answers.


625
00:31:04.873 --> 00:31:07.275
And so l have to be careful
how l share my opinions.


626
00:31:07.306 --> 00:31:10.275
So Roy just was trying
to help me out,


627
00:31:10.306 --> 00:31:13.409
and l accepted his offer.

628
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.575
l just, you know...
It's just too bad


629
00:31:15.606 --> 00:31:17.407
that association with him,

630
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.608
l never thought
that would hurt me.


631
00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.809
We couldn't accept
a pretender board, so to speak.


632
00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:25.508
So we couldn't
accept the score.


633
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.610
l would encourage Steve
just to leave that board behind,


634
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.177
leave Roy behind, and only play
on other Donkey Hong machines


635
00:31:38.206 --> 00:31:40.308
like the one at Funspot,
for example.


636
00:31:40.339 --> 00:31:42.108
To me, most importantly,
is you travel


637
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.175
to a sanctioned location,
like Funspot.


638
00:31:44.206 --> 00:31:46.474
Uh, that makes it official.

639
00:31:46.506 --> 00:31:51.611
lf tomorrow Tiger Woods goes
and he golfs a 59, big deal.


640
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.376
lf he does that at Augusta,
that's where it counts.


641
00:31:54.406 --> 00:31:58.610
He's never really
asserted himself


642
00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.875
in a way
that l think he should.


643
00:32:00.906 --> 00:32:04.509
lt's been--
just disappointed so many times


644
00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:06.742
where you just kind of, like,
throw your hands up and go,


645
00:32:06.773 --> 00:32:08.774
''Well, let's move on
to the next thing.''


646
00:32:08.806 --> 00:32:11.108
Everything would've
fell right into place,


647
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.043
but he forgot about one thing:

648
00:32:15.073 --> 00:32:16.607
that l would--about me

649
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.675
convincing Steve Wiebe
not to be a chump,


650
00:32:18.706 --> 00:32:21.575
talking him out of being--
out of chumpatizing himself.


651
00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:25.676
l didn't think twice
about sending him to back east.


652
00:32:25.706 --> 00:32:28.275
lt was like, ''Absolutely.
Go kick some ass.''


653
00:32:34.006 --> 00:32:37.242
Hi. My name is Justine Barker,
and l'm Miss Winnipesaukee.


654
00:32:37.273 --> 00:32:39.241
l would like to welcome you
to the seventh annual


655
00:32:39.273 --> 00:32:42.376
American Classic Arcade Museum
Tournament at Funspot.


656
00:32:42.406 --> 00:32:48.044
Funspot has become the best
recognized place worldwide


657
00:32:48.073 --> 00:32:51.810
for those who want to set a
world record on a classic game.


658
00:32:52.806 --> 00:32:55.441
#  You're the best around #

659
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.374
#  Nothing's gonna ever
keep you down #


660
00:32:57.406 --> 00:32:58.507
#  You're the best #

661
00:32:58.539 --> 00:33:02.510
Funspot is the Mecca
of classic arcade games.


662
00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:04.942
That place is awesome.

663
00:33:06.106 --> 00:33:07.674
Funspot's the premier place

664
00:33:07.706 --> 00:33:10.909
where the media comes
and meets with the superstars.


665
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.109
That's--You don't see
maybe a lot of DDG,


666
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.175
which is drop dead gorgeous
if you don't know--


667
00:33:16.206 --> 00:33:17.874
girls who are playing
the games.


668
00:33:17.906 --> 00:33:21.709
The world's best players
of classic games


669
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.675
are coming here
to do what they do best.


670
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.674
Play well.

671
00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.775
#  You're the best around #

672
00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:30.941
#  Nothing's gonna ever
keep you down #


673
00:33:30.973 --> 00:33:32.174
#  You're the best #

674
00:33:37.206 --> 00:33:38.707
#  ...around #

675
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.575
Very recently,
just a few months back,


676
00:33:40.606 --> 00:33:42.908
l turned 30, and l retired,

677
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.708
and l moved here
to New Hampshire.


678
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.842
And l live right close
to Funspot.


679
00:33:46.873 --> 00:33:48.808
l play games at Funspot
every day now.


680
00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:50.508
l'm gonna have ten pieces
of well done bacon,


681
00:33:50.539 --> 00:33:52.275
l'm gonna have
four hardboiled eggs.


682
00:33:52.306 --> 00:33:53.874
l'm gonna have three pancakes,

683
00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:55.574
and hopefully,
play some great games.


684
00:33:55.606 --> 00:33:57.174
Here l am in my garage.

685
00:33:57.206 --> 00:33:59.207
We're gonna give
Billy Mitchell a call,


686
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.610
see if he's up to a challenge
at Funspot.


687
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.742
Let's go ahead
and dial him up.


688
00:34:04.773 --> 00:34:05.874
Hi.
You've reached Bill Mitchell.


689
00:34:05.906 --> 00:34:07.641
l'm sorry l'm unavailable
to take your call.


690
00:34:07.673 --> 00:34:08.840
Please leave your name
and phone number.


691
00:34:08.873 --> 00:34:11.475
l'll call you back as soon
as possible. Thank you.


692
00:34:11.506 --> 00:34:13.107
At the tone,
please record your message.


693
00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.140
When you finish recording--

694
00:34:14.173 --> 00:34:15.307
l got a phone message.

695
00:34:15.339 --> 00:34:18.209
--press ''1'' for more options.

696
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.208
Hey, Billy.
This is Steve Wiebe.


697
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.507
Just calling
to see how you're doin'.


698
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.142
Hope everything's okay
with you.


699
00:34:24.173 --> 00:34:27.042
Just seein' what your plans
are for Funspot.


700
00:34:27.073 --> 00:34:30.142
l was--Walter Day
invited me out there.


701
00:34:30.173 --> 00:34:31.407
And l was just wonderin'
it'd be cool


702
00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:33.241
if we could maybe, uh,

703
00:34:33.273 --> 00:34:35.475
just have a kind of friendly
competition thing.


704
00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:41.075
l help a lot of people
who wanna go to contests.


705
00:34:41.106 --> 00:34:43.675
When l look at different people
who were my favorites,


706
00:34:43.706 --> 00:34:47.042
who l'd wanna help,
she's at the top of the list.


707
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.240
- Surprise.
- Oh, my God.


708
00:34:51.273 --> 00:34:55.076
And at the ripe age of 80,
she's gonna go to Funspot,


709
00:34:55.106 --> 00:34:57.475
and she's gonna set
a world record on Qbert.


710
00:34:57.506 --> 00:34:58.506
Okay.

711
00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.774
- That's the challenge.
- All right.


712
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:00.973
- Is that agreed?
- Yeah.


713
00:35:01.006 --> 00:35:02.207
All right.

714
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.708
#  Nothing's gonna ever
keep you down #


715
00:35:03.906 --> 00:35:06.541
#  You're the best around #

716
00:35:06.573 --> 00:35:13.613
#  Nothing's gonna ever
keep you down #


717
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.974
You know, we have
a Donkey Hong machine here


718
00:35:15.006 --> 00:35:17.742
that Funspot purchased
in its year of issue,


719
00:35:17.773 --> 00:35:19.841
and it might even be a little
bit tougher to play here.


720
00:35:19.873 --> 00:35:22.041
People complain about getting
too many wild barrels.


721
00:35:22.073 --> 00:35:23.741
And although
it's totally a random element,


722
00:35:23.773 --> 00:35:26.342
uh, if you're gonna set a score,
you come to Funspot,


723
00:35:26.373 --> 00:35:29.242
set it on their Donkey Hong
that everybody knows about.


724
00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:31.141
They won't give me my record,

725
00:35:31.173 --> 00:35:34.976
so they've urged me to come out
and do it live.


726
00:35:35.006 --> 00:35:37.742
And l think it's cooler
to do it live, too, so...


727
00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:39.975
l'm prem amped up
about Donkey Hong.


728
00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:43.142
Because l am a serious contender
on Donkey Hong.


729
00:35:43.173 --> 00:35:44.774
l've been trying
to actually beat the score


730
00:35:44.806 --> 00:35:47.608
that Billy Mitchell
got back in 1982.


731
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.409
Uh, Nicole,
she's, uh--She was stressing


732
00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:54.777
about being home this weekend
with the kids without me.


733
00:35:54.806 --> 00:35:56.240
She's probably getting sick
of the Donkey Hong thing.


734
00:35:56.273 --> 00:35:58.341
lt doesn't seem to die.

735
00:35:58.373 --> 00:35:59.574
This is a big weekend,
and l'm really hoping


736
00:35:59.606 --> 00:36:00.907
that this fellow shows up

737
00:36:00.939 --> 00:36:02.708
because, um, you know,
he'd like to tell you


738
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.775
that, uh, he's
the Donkey Hong champion.


739
00:36:04.806 --> 00:36:07.675
And, um, the fact
of the matter is, um,


740
00:36:07.706 --> 00:36:10.475
all of us have not
seen him play Donkey Hong.


741
00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:12.641
No one really noticed me
at first.


742
00:36:12.673 --> 00:36:16.476
l was kinda lookin' to see
who l'd pay the money to


743
00:36:16.506 --> 00:36:19.275
to get in the tournament,
signed in.


744
00:36:19.306 --> 00:36:21.341
l recognized Robert Mruczek.

745
00:36:21.373 --> 00:36:24.109
Zack is about 30 seconds away
from dying.


746
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.676
So l just prem much walked
over to the Donkey Hong machine.


747
00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:29.541
Okay.
We might have a good story.


748
00:36:29.573 --> 00:36:31.408
lt looks like
the mysterious player


749
00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:33.141
from the West Coast,
Steve Wiebe is here,


750
00:36:33.173 --> 00:36:34.607
um, playing Donkey Hong.

751
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.641
So maybe l, uh--l'm gonna stop
watching the tournament,


752
00:36:36.673 --> 00:36:38.441
and we'll go over,
see him.


753
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.041
- Hey, Walter.
- You did it, man.


754
00:36:42.073 --> 00:36:43.641
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.


755
00:36:44.973 --> 00:36:46.474
Yeah.

756
00:36:55.473 --> 00:36:57.174
He didn't say anything to me,
unless he...


757
00:36:58.573 --> 00:37:00.741
Probably a week,
or a few days ago.


758
00:37:00.773 --> 00:37:02.241
Steve, apparently,
as l understand it,


759
00:37:02.273 --> 00:37:03.273
is here right now

760
00:37:03.306 --> 00:37:05.608
to prove to everyone
that he's got what it takes.


761
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.710
But with Donkey Hong, it's,
you know--it's a little random.


762
00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:14.311
You could get, um, bad luck
with a barrel--with the barrels.


763
00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:15.774
You can get bad luck
with the fireballs,


764
00:37:15.806 --> 00:37:17.274
with conveyor belts,
with the elevators.


765
00:37:17.306 --> 00:37:19.574
Because that's a tough machine.

766
00:37:19.606 --> 00:37:22.775
These people think that the
machine is possessed, really.


767
00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:24.574
Even Bill
thinks it's possessed.


768
00:37:24.606 --> 00:37:27.942
But, um, if Steve can pull off

769
00:37:27.973 --> 00:37:30.141
on that machine,
that's a good score.


770
00:37:35.406 --> 00:37:36.406
Well, Billy Mitchell's
the champ,


771
00:37:36.439 --> 00:37:37.974
and l guess that makes me
the prodigy.


772
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:40.908
So we've got the prodigy
against the newcomer.


773
00:37:40.939 --> 00:37:43.509
You can really make a comparison
between an athletic event, um,


774
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.774
and this
because this is, you know,


775
00:37:44.806 --> 00:37:46.841
this is four days of, you know,
really of alertness


776
00:37:46.873 --> 00:37:49.342
and paying attention,
and, uh, you know,


777
00:37:49.373 --> 00:37:51.775
not as hard as doing
a decathlon or a triathlon


778
00:37:51.806 --> 00:37:53.073
but still very, very hard.

779
00:38:00.773 --> 00:38:03.475
Do you want me to get it?

780
00:38:03.506 --> 00:38:05.474
That's Funspot.

781
00:38:05.506 --> 00:38:06.773
Hello.

782
00:38:06.806 --> 00:38:08.474
Hey, Brian. How you doin'?

783
00:38:08.506 --> 00:38:09.807
Steve Wiebe walked in,

784
00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:12.008
so l've been over at
the Donkey Hong the whole time.


785
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.441
Um, what do you think?

786
00:38:13.473 --> 00:38:15.174
Um, l'm gonna be, uh,
you know, playing


787
00:38:15.206 --> 00:38:17.041
over Steve Wiebe's shoulder.

788
00:38:17.073 --> 00:38:18.641
All right.
l'll talk to you later.


789
00:38:18.673 --> 00:38:19.673
- Okay.
- Bye.


790
00:38:19.706 --> 00:38:20.940
Bye.

791
00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:30.108
Brian Huh came over,
and he's one of the guys


792
00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.811
that came to my house
that fateful afternoon


793
00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:36.741
to check out my machine.

794
00:38:36.773 --> 00:38:41.110
We're about to pass 520,OOO
On One Man.


795
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.441
So we really have, uh,

796
00:38:42.473 --> 00:38:46.276
have a memorable game here
at the Funspot tournament.


797
00:38:46.306 --> 00:38:47.573
And maybe--
maybe l'll skip dinner


798
00:38:47.606 --> 00:38:48.606
and squeeze in a game,

799
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.575
and we'll come back
with a score on there.


800
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.675
- Come right in, Brian.
- Yep.


801
00:39:00.806 --> 00:39:02.707
That ape
is very, very cunning,


802
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.242
and he will do
what he needs to to stop you.


803
00:39:05.273 --> 00:39:07.608
l couldn't get up fast enough,
and it got me on the left.


804
00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.308
Yeah.

805
00:39:13.706 --> 00:39:15.941
l scored 229,OOO points.

806
00:39:15.973 --> 00:39:18.608
Prem weak game, considering l
played a few already.


807
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.609
A little bit half
than what Steve scored,


808
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.941
and Steve's up again.

809
00:39:35.273 --> 00:39:37.274
All right.
We brought you to Qbert.


810
00:39:37.306 --> 00:39:39.007
You dedicated time to it.

811
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.142
You said you'd give up
some of your other vices


812
00:39:41.173 --> 00:39:42.407
in order to practice.

813
00:39:42.439 --> 00:39:44.141
We're not gonna lose.
We're not gonna be disappointed.


814
00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:45.173
We're going there to win.

815
00:39:45.206 --> 00:39:48.409
But l have one project,
one thing far more important.


816
00:39:48.439 --> 00:39:52.043
What l need you to deliver
is this.


817
00:39:53.839 --> 00:39:55.908
What is this?

818
00:39:55.939 --> 00:39:57.808
This is a score that they've
wanted to see for a long time,


819
00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:00.042
and l've held it
for all too long.


820
00:40:00.073 --> 00:40:01.908
You give it to Robert
or you give it to Walter.


821
00:40:01.939 --> 00:40:03.808
You can lose your luggage,
but don't lose the tape.


822
00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:05.741
- Okay.
- Okay?


823
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.308
l'm doing it
just for the fun of it.


824
00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.709
When l do an actual score,
l'll do it in person.


825
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:11.941
He's a very devious person.

826
00:40:11.973 --> 00:40:15.976
He works things out to his end
very well.


827
00:40:17.273 --> 00:40:18.874
We're really seeing
a great game here.


828
00:40:18.906 --> 00:40:23.243
Uh, it almost--Uh, Steve almost
Iost a man right there


829
00:40:23.273 --> 00:40:24.273
at the end of that board.

830
00:40:24.306 --> 00:40:25.907
He got a lucky, lucky break.

831
00:40:25.939 --> 00:40:29.276
The randomness went the opposite
way that it usually goes.


832
00:40:29.306 --> 00:40:31.274
And, uh,
Steve is still going here.


833
00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:45.109
Oh. l didn't see that.

834
00:40:59.339 --> 00:41:01.775
Steve Wiebe
is on his second man.


835
00:41:03.373 --> 00:41:05.308
He's at 696,OOO.

836
00:41:08.573 --> 00:41:11.242
- Who is this guy?
- What? This is Steve Wiebe.


837
00:41:11.273 --> 00:41:12.540
- l won't bother you anymore.
- No problem, man.


838
00:41:12.573 --> 00:41:13.907
- l just wanna say hi.
- Yeah. Nice meeting you.


839
00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:15.608
- Yeah, you, too.
- All right.


840
00:41:17.006 --> 00:41:19.575
He could beat it if he--
if he--


841
00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.475
He'd have to have
a really good game.


842
00:41:24.673 --> 00:41:26.174
l don't think he knows
the tricks that Billy knows,


843
00:41:26.206 --> 00:41:28.975
but l hear he's very good
on the escalator stage.


844
00:41:32.773 --> 00:41:36.276
Okay. Well, right now
Steve Wiebe has 870,OOO points


845
00:41:36.306 --> 00:41:38.074
on an active game
of Donkey Hong.


846
00:41:38.106 --> 00:41:40.341
Uh, if he clears
a few more boards,


847
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:42.641
he's gonna have a shot
at getting to the kill screen.


848
00:41:42.673 --> 00:41:43.774
Uh, as far as l know,

849
00:41:43.806 --> 00:41:45.541
no one's ever achieved
the kill screen


850
00:41:45.573 --> 00:41:48.108
on the Donkey Hong machine
at Funspot.


851
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:52.444
Numerous classic games, they
all have something in common.


852
00:41:52.473 --> 00:41:54.675
They have an end
to the game play.


853
00:41:54.706 --> 00:41:57.408
There's not quite enough memory
for the final board.


854
00:41:57.439 --> 00:41:59.608
lt's called a ''kill screen''
because basically,


855
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.941
there's no way
to finish the level.


856
00:42:00.973 --> 00:42:05.377
That some sort of random data,
or code, inside the program,


857
00:42:05.406 --> 00:42:07.841
ends up getting used
for what you see on the screen.


858
00:42:07.873 --> 00:42:11.576
Donkey Hong is really strange
in that it actually lets you


859
00:42:11.606 --> 00:42:13.441
play the fi--um,

860
00:42:13.473 --> 00:42:15.374
the kill screen level
for maybe five seconds or so.


861
00:42:15.406 --> 00:42:16.406
Everything looks normal

862
00:42:16.439 --> 00:42:19.176
and then, suddenly,
Mario just up and dies on you.


863
00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.177
The people who could get
besides myself,


864
00:42:24.206 --> 00:42:28.376
that have been seen getting
to the end of Donkey Hong...


865
00:42:31.373 --> 00:42:33.808
Gee, now that l think about it,
l don't think anybody has.


866
00:42:57.106 --> 00:42:58.173
lf anybody wants to see,

867
00:42:58.206 --> 00:43:00.474
there's a Donkey Hong
kill screen coming up.


868
00:43:00.506 --> 00:43:03.008
There's a Donkey Hong
kill screen coming up


869
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.875
if anybody wants to watch.

870
00:43:04.906 --> 00:43:06.374
You got to be able
to perform in the show


871
00:43:06.406 --> 00:43:07.974
with someone who's a contender

872
00:43:08.006 --> 00:43:10.174
staring straight at you,
staring at the game,


873
00:43:10.206 --> 00:43:11.974
Possibly even playing mind games
with you.


874
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:13.374
l mean, it's all--
it's part of being a champion.


875
00:43:13.406 --> 00:43:15.040
You have to overcome it.

876
00:43:15.073 --> 00:43:18.209
There's a potential Donkey Hong
kill screen if you wanna watch.


877
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.409
l can tell he's not on my side.

878
00:43:21.439 --> 00:43:24.743
He's one--
He's a disciple of, uh, Billy.


879
00:43:24.773 --> 00:43:27.342
This is, uh--You know, he's
gonna have to play it perfectly.


880
00:43:27.373 --> 00:43:29.508
He's at the hardest part
of Donkey Hong.


881
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.409
And, uh, you know,
it's not gonna get any easier.


882
00:43:32.439 --> 00:43:34.308
So we may have
an exciting moment here


883
00:43:34.339 --> 00:43:36.975
or, you know,
the pressure may get to him.


884
00:43:37.006 --> 00:43:38.941
One of those random elements
might happen.


885
00:43:38.973 --> 00:43:40.674
Uh, sounds like
he just cleared another board,


886
00:43:40.706 --> 00:43:43.909
but we could have a wild barrel
or some aggressive fireballs.


887
00:43:43.939 --> 00:43:46.375
l thought l was gonna be
the first Funspot kill screen.


888
00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:48.841
And then, l had--
l had three fireballs trap me.


889
00:43:48.873 --> 00:43:51.141
l had the hammer in my hand.
They still got me.


890
00:43:51.173 --> 00:43:53.408
So anything can happen
in Donkey Hong.


891
00:43:53.439 --> 00:43:56.009
So, uh, for someone else
to beat me to the kill screen


892
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.808
would be a let down,
but let's see what happens.


893
00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:59.741
Maybe he'll--Maybe he'll crack
under the pressure,


894
00:43:59.773 --> 00:44:02.008
and maybe l'll get my chance
to do it first.


895
00:44:04.606 --> 00:44:06.741
There's a Donkey Hong
kill screen might be coming up,


896
00:44:06.773 --> 00:44:08.141
if anybody wants to see it.

897
00:44:08.173 --> 00:44:09.841
Hey, Todd,
if you're interested,


898
00:44:09.873 --> 00:44:11.841
there might be a Donkey Hong
kill screen


899
00:44:11.873 --> 00:44:13.274
in a couple of minutes.

900
00:44:17.106 --> 00:44:21.376
l think the energy
kind of picked me up.


901
00:44:21.406 --> 00:44:23.708
l was feeling kind
of like a zombie


902
00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.641
in the middle of the game.

903
00:44:25.673 --> 00:44:27.574
But towards the end,
l got, you know,


904
00:44:27.606 --> 00:44:30.175
a little bit of a natural rush
going from the crowd


905
00:44:30.206 --> 00:44:31.907
and the excitement.

906
00:44:31.939 --> 00:44:33.574
So that kind of boosted me

907
00:44:33.606 --> 00:44:36.709
and put me over the top
to complete the game.


908
00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.309
The kill screen.
The kill screen kicked in.


909
00:44:47.673 --> 00:44:51.176
This is the highest Donkey Hong
score done in public.


910
00:44:51.206 --> 00:44:53.274
Um, Walter Day stated that this

911
00:44:53.306 --> 00:44:55.474
was the highest score
ever done,


912
00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:57.541
and this is
the first kill screen


913
00:44:57.573 --> 00:45:00.075
achieved on Funspot's machine.

914
00:45:00.106 --> 00:45:02.041
Steve Wiebe has become
the third person


915
00:45:02.073 --> 00:45:04.508
to reach
Donkey Hong's kill screen.


916
00:45:07.439 --> 00:45:10.176
This is completely
hard verification.


917
00:45:10.206 --> 00:45:11.340
You know what l mean?

918
00:45:11.373 --> 00:45:13.308
There's nothing stronger
than having it be done


919
00:45:13.339 --> 00:45:14.708
in front of a crowd.

920
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.008
The process,
it stands for itself.


921
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.375
He did it in front of all of us,
but this solves


922
00:45:19.406 --> 00:45:21.274
any kind of doubt that there
could have ever been.


923
00:45:24.773 --> 00:45:27.108
Now you'll get all the accolades
you deserve and that's--


924
00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.342
that's just the way it is
but, you know...


925
00:45:31.573 --> 00:45:32.573
So it's good.

926
00:45:32.606 --> 00:45:34.007
And l guess
there was kind of like


927
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.442
an impromptu press conference
after the--


928
00:45:36.473 --> 00:45:38.107
after the score happened.

929
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.308
There were, you know...
There were cameras on the game.


930
00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:41.674
There were cameras
on Steve Wiebe.


931
00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:44.742
There were cameras on the crowd
Iooking at Steve Wiebe.


932
00:45:44.773 --> 00:45:47.142
l didn't get an exact count
of the people.


933
00:45:47.173 --> 00:45:48.941
There were a lot
of other witnesses in the crowd


934
00:45:48.973 --> 00:45:50.908
and people watchin' it,
so, you know,


935
00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:54.910
we have a verified score on a
Iegitimate Donkey Hong machine


936
00:45:54.939 --> 00:45:55.974
for Steve Wiebe now.

937
00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:00.741
We just got off the internet,

938
00:46:00.773 --> 00:46:03.775
where l logged on the front page
of the Twin Galaxies web site


939
00:46:03.806 --> 00:46:08.510
the news story that Steve Wiebe
just scored 985,600 points,


940
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.074
which, essentially,
is the officially recognized


941
00:46:10.106 --> 00:46:12.775
first place score
on the web site.


942
00:46:12.806 --> 00:46:15.241
So he's been announced
as the world champion.


943
00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:16.340
We'll see what happens now

944
00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:21.010
with Steve putting the pressure
back on Billy Mitchell.


945
00:46:21.806 --> 00:46:22.873
Thank you.

946
00:46:22.906 --> 00:46:25.275
l think it hit him prem hard.

947
00:46:25.306 --> 00:46:26.306
Thank you
for volunteering your phone.


948
00:46:26.339 --> 00:46:27.507
This was an important call to--

949
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:30.576
Oh, no, no.
l understand that.


950
00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:31.840
Yeah, l can imagine.

951
00:46:31.873 --> 00:46:34.075
He probably
wasn't real thrilled.


952
00:46:34.106 --> 00:46:36.107
Yeah, he said,
now his playing out the tape


953
00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.242
that he submitted
is more important, uh...


954
00:46:38.273 --> 00:46:39.273
more important than ever,
l guess.


955
00:46:39.306 --> 00:46:42.275
- Don't share that with anybody.
- No--l--Well, obviously.


956
00:46:46.473 --> 00:46:49.042
We've got everybody
on the invitation-only list.


957
00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:51.742
And, uh, you know what?
Walter is here.


958
00:46:51.773 --> 00:46:54.242
We're just kind of, you know,
tellin' jokes and havin' fun.


959
00:46:54.273 --> 00:46:55.907
Um, who's there?
Like Todd and Duane?


960
00:46:55.939 --> 00:46:57.541
Yeah.

961
00:46:57.573 --> 00:46:59.441
What l mean is,
it's probably a good idea,


962
00:46:59.473 --> 00:47:01.007
like, if l say hi to Todd.

963
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.040
Actually, would you believe

964
00:47:02.073 --> 00:47:03.574
he's in the middle
of a--of a Lady Bug game.


965
00:47:03.606 --> 00:47:05.441
l don't think
we wanna interrupt.


966
00:47:05.473 --> 00:47:07.641
We have a Lady Bug cabaret
in the cabin,


967
00:47:07.673 --> 00:47:09.207
and Todd's got
a score going.


968
00:47:10.339 --> 00:47:12.508
Okay, we're gonna get Walter
on the phone.


969
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.476
Um, a couple of hours ago,
we were all at the Funspot,


970
00:47:15.506 --> 00:47:17.841
and, uh, Brian Huh said

971
00:47:17.873 --> 00:47:21.243
that Billy, um, had a delivery
for us here at the cabin.


972
00:47:21.273 --> 00:47:23.074
Oh!

973
00:47:24.073 --> 00:47:25.574
Brian Huh, he's kind of like--

974
00:47:25.606 --> 00:47:26.940
He's kinda like
really good friends with Billy.


975
00:47:26.973 --> 00:47:29.075
He talks to him
all the time.


976
00:47:29.106 --> 00:47:32.375
Um, he said everybody is gonna
wanna see what's on the tape.


977
00:47:33.439 --> 00:47:36.109
Brian Huh is there?

978
00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.609
He knows everything to do
with the tape.


979
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.908
He knows to guard the tape
with his life.


980
00:47:41.873 --> 00:47:42.873
l explained to him.

981
00:47:42.906 --> 00:47:45.808
He could lose his life,
but don't lose the tape.


982
00:47:47.206 --> 00:47:50.108
Who wants to hear
the announcement?


983
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.510
So even in Florida,
the long arm of Billy Mitchell


984
00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.975
has reached in here
to Funspot seven


985
00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:58.541
to cause
more interesting developments.


986
00:47:58.573 --> 00:48:02.143
Now, we're gonna start
on this TV screen the videotape


987
00:48:02.173 --> 00:48:05.242
and, essentially,
if Steve Wiebe or Brian Huh


988
00:48:05.273 --> 00:48:08.643
or anybody else can also beat
the score on that tape


989
00:48:08.673 --> 00:48:11.075
by about 4:OO
tomorrow afternoon,


990
00:48:11.106 --> 00:48:14.375
he'll give them $10,OOO, okay?

991
00:48:14.406 --> 00:48:17.575
And we know Billy Mitchell can
pay these promises, too, okay?


992
00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:21.276
So he has it while l'm tryin'
to get a million live.


993
00:48:21.306 --> 00:48:25.777
He has it set out
so people, you know, at Funspot


994
00:48:25.806 --> 00:48:29.442
can gather around
and...and look at his tape.


995
00:48:31.206 --> 00:48:33.308
Okay, here we are.
We got cameras on the screen,


996
00:48:33.339 --> 00:48:34.340
cameras on the crowd.

997
00:48:34.373 --> 00:48:35.907
No one's gonna miss this moment.

998
00:48:35.939 --> 00:48:37.641
998,2.

999
00:48:39.773 --> 00:48:41.574
Here we go.

1000
00:48:41.606 --> 00:48:45.543
We have every eye in the crowd
focused right on your screen.


1001
00:48:46.606 --> 00:48:48.374
Everybody's lookin',
every camera's on here.


1002
00:48:48.406 --> 00:48:50.407
We're not gonna miss this
for anything.


1003
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.274
l don't think
there's any distraction


1004
00:48:55.306 --> 00:48:57.307
that can pull everyone away
right now.


1005
00:49:00.406 --> 00:49:01.573
Oh, and look at that.

1006
00:49:01.606 --> 00:49:03.908
And with the bonus, we have
the first million point game


1007
00:49:03.939 --> 00:49:05.074
of Donkey Hong.

1008
00:49:05.106 --> 00:49:07.141
And the score--
And the score reads zero.


1009
00:49:07.173 --> 00:49:09.308
Six zeroes all the way across.

1010
00:49:15.106 --> 00:49:18.209
Not even Helen of Troy had
that much--much attention.


1011
00:49:20.073 --> 00:49:23.543
Billy kinda steal the show,
and he's not even there.


1012
00:49:23.573 --> 00:49:27.877
lt's kinda the way
they, you know,


1013
00:49:27.906 --> 00:49:31.876
were kind of diffusing
what l was going for, you know,


1014
00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:35.409
in hyping up Billy's,
you know, videotape.


1015
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.543
1,047,200 points

1016
00:49:41.573 --> 00:49:43.207
is the highest score
any have ever seen.


1017
00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.208
l don't know. l suppose Walter's
got to get in that office


1018
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.542
to that computer now,
doesn't he?


1019
00:49:48.773 --> 00:49:50.708
Okay, um, go ahead and, uh...

1020
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.808
Go ahead and hand to Walter
the phone real quick.


1021
00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:54.141
Hi, Billy.

1022
00:49:54.173 --> 00:49:56.475
Prem good.
It's all been wonderful.


1023
00:49:56.506 --> 00:49:58.574
Billy's probably
the closest person


1024
00:49:58.606 --> 00:50:00.207
to being a Jedi
of any of the players,


1025
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.377
and he refers to it with humor
as ''Obi-Wan Henobi-ing'' people.


1026
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.575
Steve Wiebe
not having the opportunity


1027
00:50:18.606 --> 00:50:20.607
to view anything
that Bill Mitchell does.


1028
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.309
l mean, Bill Mitchell plays
at a great advantage.


1029
00:50:23.339 --> 00:50:24.974
When Billy Mitchell
is watching


1030
00:50:25.006 --> 00:50:28.676
Steve's world-record
winning tapes,


1031
00:50:28.706 --> 00:50:30.774
he's in a position
to study Steve's technique.


1032
00:50:30.806 --> 00:50:32.507
When the man says,
''l wanna see your papers,''


1033
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.841
and Obi
-Wan Henobi goes,

1034
00:50:33.873 --> 00:50:35.441
''You don't need
to see our papers,''


1035
00:50:35.473 --> 00:50:36.941
and suddenly the guy says,
''You can go.


1036
00:50:36.973 --> 00:50:38.307
l don't need
to see your papers.''


1037
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.775
You saw the tape,
which is no doubt a copy


1038
00:50:51.806 --> 00:50:53.741
because l'm sure
he didn't send the master.


1039
00:50:53.773 --> 00:50:59.278
He's gonna send a copy
or the master to Rob Mrcuzek,


1040
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:02.742
who is the chief referee
of Twin Galaxies.


1041
00:51:02.773 --> 00:51:06.643
l try to promote Twin Galaxies
as ''integrity above all.''


1042
00:51:06.673 --> 00:51:10.576
Um, l will do that
with my dying breath.


1043
00:51:10.606 --> 00:51:15.677
And if a gamer knowingly cheats
or tries to put one past us,


1044
00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:18.909
we will make sure that the score
is not recognized.


1045
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.875
Did the gamer pause at any time?

1046
00:51:31.906 --> 00:51:34.241
lllegal glitches
or glitch abuse.


1047
00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.007
Did they cheat?

1048
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.275
Did they pause the game
after the load-up


1049
00:51:48.306 --> 00:51:50.574
for the purpose
of using a flying erase head


1050
00:51:50.606 --> 00:51:52.874
to then reload the game
at different settings?


1051
00:51:52.906 --> 00:51:54.140
l gotta look for things
like that.


1052
00:51:54.173 --> 00:51:57.543
This tape may be done
in a week, week and a half,


1053
00:51:57.573 --> 00:51:58.607
to answer your question.

1054
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.509
All these wonderful games
are fixed to the left.


1055
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.042
Walter is entering this
into the Internet as we speak.


1056
00:52:12.073 --> 00:52:13.808
Well, Billy Mitchell
is being upgraded.


1057
00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:15.708
We're officially submitting
his score.


1058
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.710
Uh, 1 ,047,OOO
and how much, Billy?


1059
00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.208
- Was it 200 or 300?
- Two hundred.


1060
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.608
That's what l thought.

1061
00:52:46.906 --> 00:52:48.440
Right on the barrels, yeah.

1062
00:52:49.006 --> 00:52:51.708
lt's kind of ironic
that he went--


1063
00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.543
He was a guy that pushed
for live scores all the time.


1064
00:52:55.573 --> 00:52:58.976
And now here l am at Funspot
busting my ass


1065
00:52:59.006 --> 00:53:00.073
to get a live score

1066
00:53:00.106 --> 00:53:02.441
and he just submits
taped scores now


1067
00:53:02.473 --> 00:53:03.607
and then gets the record.

1068
00:53:10.406 --> 00:53:12.141
World record headquarters.
Can l help you?


1069
00:53:12.173 --> 00:53:16.176
lf this score, this ''Donkey
Hong'' defines Billy Mitchell,


1070
00:53:16.206 --> 00:53:19.409
then why could he not find time
in his life to go to Funspot?


1071
00:53:19.439 --> 00:53:21.241
Steve did.
Steve has a job.


1072
00:53:21.273 --> 00:53:22.574
Steve has a family.
Steve has kids.


1073
00:53:22.606 --> 00:53:24.607
He went. Why can't Billy?

1074
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.244
l think he feels
that pressure to, um,


1075
00:53:29.273 --> 00:53:32.576
to meet people's
expectations of him,


1076
00:53:32.606 --> 00:53:35.408
and he puts a lot of pressure
on himself,


1077
00:53:35.439 --> 00:53:36.674
and if he doesn't succeed,

1078
00:53:36.706 --> 00:53:39.408
l think he feels
like he's failed them.


1079
00:53:39.439 --> 00:53:42.009
And he feels that deeply,
l think.


1080
00:53:47.373 --> 00:53:51.343
lf l were to break a million,
he wanted to maybe show that,


1081
00:53:51.373 --> 00:53:53.108
you know, l've already done it

1082
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.976
because no one knows
that l've done it, too.


1083
00:54:15.306 --> 00:54:17.374
l haven't really thought
too much about, um...


1084
00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:21.041
you know, the--the controversy.

1085
00:54:21.073 --> 00:54:23.141
l've kind of let it go since
l, you know, l went to Funspot,


1086
00:54:23.173 --> 00:54:26.442
did--did my best.
Got my score up.


1087
00:54:26.473 --> 00:54:27.907
l've been killing myself
for like--


1088
00:54:27.939 --> 00:54:30.375
with school 12 to 14 hours,

1089
00:54:30.406 --> 00:54:33.208
prepping three classes
and grading--


1090
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.175
every--every day after school.

1091
00:54:35.206 --> 00:54:36.273
Almost there till eight.

1092
00:54:39.206 --> 00:54:43.043
A lot of my songs
are like big rock songs,


1093
00:54:43.073 --> 00:54:47.343
with lots of guitars in them,
Iots of layers of vocals.


1094
00:54:47.373 --> 00:54:49.708
Here's one called ''Three Lies.''
l'm gonna sing this to you guys


1095
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.443
in the midst
of this cold summer day.


1096
00:54:53.473 --> 00:54:55.541
This is who l really am.

1097
00:54:55.573 --> 00:54:57.374
l'm some guy out there
who's supposed to be an artist,


1098
00:54:57.406 --> 00:54:59.574
who's up there
just getting wild and crazy.


1099
00:54:59.606 --> 00:55:01.641
#  Didn't l tell you #

1100
00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:03.641
#  You, you, you, you #

1101
00:55:03.673 --> 00:55:06.776
#  Never not to love #

1102
00:55:06.806 --> 00:55:09.308
'Cause l'm being--
l'm being Mr. Scorekeeper,


1103
00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:10.774
and l've been doing it
for 25 years,


1104
00:55:10.806 --> 00:55:13.041
so there's all these
automaton things l can turn on.


1105
00:55:13.073 --> 00:55:14.073
''Okay. Yes.

1106
00:55:14.106 --> 00:55:15.207
''And the reason for this is that

1107
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.674
''and that the reason for that
is this,'' you know.


1108
00:55:16.706 --> 00:55:18.374
Now l'm--You know,
l'm ready to--


1109
00:55:18.406 --> 00:55:19.740
l'm ready to let it go.

1110
00:55:19.773 --> 00:55:22.842
#  Two lies are more
than plenty #


1111
00:55:22.873 --> 00:55:26.676
#  But three lies,
l'll probably be saying #


1112
00:55:26.706 --> 00:55:27.940
#  Goodbye, love #

1113
00:55:27.973 --> 00:55:29.774
No matter how many people
get involved in this,


1114
00:55:29.806 --> 00:55:31.374
it's still my child,
'cause it came


1115
00:55:31.406 --> 00:55:33.441
right out of my psyche,
you know.


1116
00:55:33.473 --> 00:55:36.809
But still, the others
are more attached to it,


1117
00:55:36.839 --> 00:55:38.841
and they believe
they need it more.


1118
00:55:38.873 --> 00:55:41.375
Part of the reason
l'm still here doing it


1119
00:55:41.406 --> 00:55:46.210
is for them to help them
have the benefit of this,


1120
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.641
or the happiness of this,

1121
00:55:47.673 --> 00:55:49.908
so that it can go on
and continue to benefit people.


1122
00:55:49.939 --> 00:55:51.174
Because it's
in such a place


1123
00:55:51.206 --> 00:55:54.008
that l don't have
to do Twin Galaxies,


1124
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.040
but l really would like

1125
00:55:55.073 --> 00:55:57.241
to see it have closure
that's positive.


1126
00:55:58.106 --> 00:56:01.275
Boy, l got cold fingers.
It's cold.


1127
00:56:04.106 --> 00:56:06.374
l often have people ask me
what my handle is,


1128
00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:08.674
what my three initials are.

1129
00:56:08.706 --> 00:56:13.944
l mean, come on.
l tell people, ''Look at me.''


1130
00:56:13.973 --> 00:56:16.141
What do you think
my three initials were?


1131
00:56:18.606 --> 00:56:20.741
lf you don't know,
you're not looking hard enough.


1132
00:56:22.506 --> 00:56:23.740
T.l.E.?

1133
00:56:23.773 --> 00:56:25.107
No.

1134
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.941
Which one
was l wearing yesterday?


1135
00:56:26.973 --> 00:56:28.574
- The America--
- U.S.A.


1136
00:56:28.606 --> 00:56:32.810
U.S.A. So l had Latin friends
and l had Canadian friends,


1137
00:56:32.839 --> 00:56:35.776
and l always had
to keep the Americans on top.


1138
00:56:39.306 --> 00:56:41.641
Hello.
This is a message for Walter.


1139
00:56:41.673 --> 00:56:44.375
This is Craig Glenday calling
from Guinness World Records.


1140
00:56:44.406 --> 00:56:45.573
Guinness from England called.

1141
00:56:45.606 --> 00:56:47.140
They want me
to call them back immediately.


1142
00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:51.173
Hello. Craig speaking.

1143
00:56:51.206 --> 00:56:53.875
Craig, this is Walter Day
with Twin Galaxies. How are you?


1144
00:56:53.906 --> 00:56:56.608
They're announcing to the world
that they trust everything we do


1145
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.141
and that they rely
on everything we do


1146
00:56:58.173 --> 00:57:01.075
as being true and honest,
and so that's why


1147
00:57:01.106 --> 00:57:03.975
they're going with us
as the official scorekeepers


1148
00:57:04.006 --> 00:57:06.808
and providers
of electronic gaming content


1149
00:57:06.839 --> 00:57:08.107
for their upcoming books.

1150
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.774
lt's become very complicated.

1151
00:57:09.806 --> 00:57:11.574
So to have someone like Walter
and his team


1152
00:57:11.606 --> 00:57:13.407
who just know everything
there is to know


1153
00:57:13.439 --> 00:57:17.143
about computer games, um,
was for us a godsend.


1154
00:57:17.173 --> 00:57:19.174
Since older people
also read your book,


1155
00:57:19.206 --> 00:57:20.874
a certain number of people
would care


1156
00:57:20.906 --> 00:57:23.375
what the world record
is on Donkey Hong.


1157
00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:26.375
We look forward
to being a part of Guinness.


1158
00:57:26.406 --> 00:57:28.474
Yeah, yeah. It's just
an, uh, reward to be here.


1159
00:57:28.506 --> 00:57:29.907
You know,
working with Twin Galaxies.


1160
00:57:29.939 --> 00:57:32.609
You just recorded a big piece
of Twin Galaxies' history,


1161
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.641
you know?
You saw what it said.


1162
00:57:34.673 --> 00:57:36.708
They're announcing to the world
we're the official scorekeepers


1163
00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.209
and people have
to be verified by us.


1164
00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.076
Wait until you see
the poster upstairs l just did


1165
00:57:42.106 --> 00:57:43.907
to turn the process
of submitting to Guinness


1166
00:57:43.939 --> 00:57:45.508
into a contest.

1167
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.275
When you wanna put a score up

1168
00:57:48.306 --> 00:57:51.542
and you wanna have
a title of world champion,


1169
00:57:51.573 --> 00:57:53.908
you're competing against
everybody in the world.


1170
00:57:53.939 --> 00:57:56.842
You want a title
for your own living room?


1171
00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:59.742
Man, l'll send you that title.
Your own arcade?


1172
00:57:59.773 --> 00:58:01.541
Man, l'll sign it,
and l'll make up a paper,


1173
00:58:01.573 --> 00:58:03.374
and l'll send you a plaque.

1174
00:58:03.406 --> 00:58:05.207
You want your name in the
Guinness Book of World Records


1175
00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.609
and in the Twin Galaxies
international scoreboard?


1176
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.743
You have to earn it.
l have to earn it.


1177
00:58:10.773 --> 00:58:14.042
There's a lot of scores
l've gotten.


1178
00:58:14.073 --> 00:58:16.842
And when the time comes
and the pressure is that hard,


1179
00:58:16.873 --> 00:58:20.142
l'll have to do it in a public
forum, as l always have.


1180
00:58:31.306 --> 00:58:32.640
ls that truthful?

1181
00:58:36.206 --> 00:58:40.543
ls that true?
Then we better get practicing.


1182
00:58:43.439 --> 00:58:46.543
The only thing to do is to--

1183
00:58:46.573 --> 00:58:49.809
Yeah, go somewhere
and break 1,OOO,047 live.


1184
00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:53.810
And that would be the only way
to do it for sure, you know?


1185
00:58:53.839 --> 00:58:56.676
There would be
no gettin' screwed over.


1186
00:58:56.706 --> 00:58:59.742
l've got kicked around
like the dog for so long,


1187
00:58:59.773 --> 00:59:02.642
l don't trust referees.

1188
00:59:02.673 --> 00:59:04.441
This is the contest
that gets them


1189
00:59:04.473 --> 00:59:06.441
into the Guinness Book
of WorId Records,


1190
00:59:06.473 --> 00:59:08.074
so they would have
that inspiration.


1191
00:59:08.106 --> 00:59:10.308
But as far as my skills, l'm--

1192
00:59:10.339 --> 00:59:12.775
Yeah, l'm feeling
on the top of my game.


1193
00:59:12.806 --> 00:59:15.008
And l'd love to see Bill
defend his title


1194
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.574
against Steve Weibe,
head-to-head.


1195
00:59:16.606 --> 00:59:19.642
That'd be great. It's all about
head-to-head competition.


1196
00:59:19.673 --> 00:59:21.841
He's kinda one of
my tougher students, he goes,


1197
00:59:21.873 --> 00:59:25.243
''Yeah. When are you gonna go
kick that guy's ass?''


1198
00:59:25.273 --> 00:59:27.074
And l go, ''Watch your language.''

1199
00:59:27.106 --> 00:59:30.542
And l go,
''l'm gonna do it here soon.''


1200
00:59:30.573 --> 00:59:33.842
And if someone is going to break
a classic arcade game record,


1201
00:59:33.873 --> 00:59:36.242
they're gonna have
to come prepared.


1202
00:59:36.273 --> 00:59:37.907
Maybe that's what l need.

1203
00:59:37.939 --> 00:59:40.242
So l can be at my best,
have him there.


1204
00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.676
#  Don't lose your grip
on the dreams of the past #


1205
00:59:44.706 --> 00:59:47.575
#  You must fight
just to keep them alive #


1206
00:59:47.606 --> 00:59:48.773
l was hoping Billy
would be there


1207
00:59:48.806 --> 00:59:51.175
so we could compete
head-to-head.


1208
00:59:51.206 --> 00:59:55.677
He's been--always an advocate
of live scores, live scores.


1209
00:59:55.706 --> 00:59:57.874
But now, he's all of a sudden
Mr. Videotape.


1210
00:59:59.106 --> 01:00:03.276
lt just--l mean, l know to win
is, like, so important.


1211
01:00:03.306 --> 01:00:06.842
But to blatantly do things
that are against the rules


1212
01:00:06.873 --> 01:00:09.675
and know in your heart
that you didn't do it correctly


1213
01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.441
and get credit for it...

1214
01:00:13.506 --> 01:00:16.542
We know what kind of--
Is there any satisfaction there?


1215
01:00:16.573 --> 01:00:18.308
l don't see--
l don't see any.


1216
01:00:34.606 --> 01:00:36.240
l just need one favor from you.

1217
01:00:36.273 --> 01:00:40.243
l know it's--of all
you've done for me, l just--


1218
01:00:40.273 --> 01:00:42.541
give me a shot at it
without you, you know,


1219
01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:44.341
kind of, bein' my backbone.

1220
01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:47.409
l need to, kind of,
attack it by myself.


1221
01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:52.244
lt says, ''Good luck, Steve,
in Donkey Hong.''


1222
01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:53.540
- All right.
- Hnock 'em dead.


1223
01:00:53.573 --> 01:00:54.707
- l will.
- You will.


1224
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.776
''Work is for people who can't
play video games.


1225
01:00:59.806 --> 01:01:01.407
- Billy Mitchell.''
- That's right.


1226
01:01:01.439 --> 01:01:06.545
Out of the entire global
classic gaming hobby,


1227
01:01:06.573 --> 01:01:08.608
there's one significant rivalry

1228
01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.709
that's equivalent
to the big rivalries in history:


1229
01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:16.311
YankeeslRed Sox, MarislMantle,
Heckle and Jeckle.


1230
01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:18.975
All the big rivalries
in history, you know.


1231
01:01:19.006 --> 01:01:20.340
This is up there on that level.

1232
01:01:20.373 --> 01:01:22.475
So Billy Mitchell
and Steve Wiebe


1233
01:01:22.506 --> 01:01:25.041
are going for the top spot

1234
01:01:25.073 --> 01:01:28.376
in the forthcoming book
of world records on Donkey Hong.


1235
01:01:28.406 --> 01:01:31.408
Hello, Billy.
This is Steve Wiebe.


1236
01:01:31.439 --> 01:01:33.508
l really think
we need to settle this thing.


1237
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.074
May the best man win.

1238
01:01:35.106 --> 01:01:37.775
So we'll be seein' you
next week.


1239
01:01:37.806 --> 01:01:39.107
He knows l'm going to be there.

1240
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.075
lt's just a skip away.

1241
01:01:41.106 --> 01:01:44.275
A hop, skip, and a jog
from his house, so...


1242
01:01:44.306 --> 01:01:46.908
there's really no excuse for him
not to be there.


1243
01:01:47.673 --> 01:01:52.477
Never leave home without it:
''How to win at Donkey Hong.''


1244
01:01:52.873 --> 01:01:54.107
Yeah, so...

1245
01:02:00.273 --> 01:02:03.509
The Guinness--
A lot of people are--


1246
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.208
Yeah, people--A lot of people
read that book.


1247
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.575
This is actually, technically,
a weightlifting glove


1248
01:02:35.606 --> 01:02:37.174
because l discovered
in the eighties


1249
01:02:37.206 --> 01:02:38.206
that you could buy

1250
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.475
a weightlifting glove
which was fingerless,


1251
01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:42.641
and l use it to--l used it
to play marble madness.


1252
01:02:42.673 --> 01:02:44.374
See the double padding?

1253
01:02:44.406 --> 01:02:46.708
Occasionally, l use this
to avoid calluses


1254
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.608
from certain joystick games.

1255
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.109
You can do Marble Madness,
a track ball all day long.


1256
01:03:07.706 --> 01:03:09.707
Excuse me, guy. l got
a celebrity in the car here.


1257
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.476
- Can l cut in front of you?
- Oh, l'm sorry--


1258
01:03:16.906 --> 01:03:20.109
- Did you get dropped off?
- l got dropped off.


1259
01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.509
- Was Billy driving?
- Billy was driving.


1260
01:03:25.439 --> 01:03:28.843
Well, anyway, welcome to
the Dodge City of video games.


1261
01:03:28.873 --> 01:03:30.608
Thank you, Walter.
Happy to be here.


1262
01:03:31.773 --> 01:03:32.773
l want this.

1263
01:03:32.806 --> 01:03:34.407
l'll get you some
out of there.


1264
01:03:48.106 --> 01:03:49.507
What do you need?

1265
01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.975
ln order: 693,500...

1266
01:03:55.506 --> 01:03:57.107
Okay.

1267
01:03:58.339 --> 01:03:59.374
Yeah.

1268
01:04:17.006 --> 01:04:19.074
Yeah. Nicole.

1269
01:04:19.106 --> 01:04:20.507
Hi. l'm Nicole.

1270
01:04:21.973 --> 01:04:23.474
And this is little Derek, huh?

1271
01:04:23.506 --> 01:04:24.907
Yeah.

1272
01:04:26.473 --> 01:04:29.275
- The faster, yeah.
- Derek, he's about--


1273
01:04:31.573 --> 01:04:33.741
l'm afraid if he can't do it,

1274
01:04:33.773 --> 01:04:35.941
he's gonna beat himself up
about it.


1275
01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:39.509
l don't know if that's the forum
in which he will be successful.


1276
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.774
l mean,
l know he can be successful.


1277
01:04:40.806 --> 01:04:42.574
l'm just afraid,
what if it doesn't happen?


1278
01:04:42.606 --> 01:04:45.041
- Bye, Derek.
- Derek, give Daddy a hug.


1279
01:04:45.073 --> 01:04:46.474
What are you guys gonna do?

1280
01:04:46.506 --> 01:04:49.141
- We're just gonna go home.
- Go swimming.


1281
01:04:49.173 --> 01:04:50.541
You gonna go swimming?
That sounds fun.


1282
01:04:50.573 --> 01:04:52.041
Okay. Let's go.

1283
01:04:52.073 --> 01:04:53.574
- Bye.
- l love you.


1284
01:04:54.906 --> 01:04:56.574
Bye. Thank you.

1285
01:04:59.006 --> 01:05:02.209
Yeah, the longer l wait,
the more, you know,


1286
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.909
pressing, l, you know,
l get more nervous.


1287
01:05:04.939 --> 01:05:07.409
So if l do it the first night,
it'll be great.


1288
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.442
Steve Wiebe is a trouper.

1289
01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.708
Steve Wiebe has come
to three events


1290
01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.977
to prove himself in the fire
of in-person competition


1291
01:05:17.006 --> 01:05:20.776
and under the stress
of having all eyes on him.


1292
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.574
Oh!

1293
01:05:50.473 --> 01:05:51.607
Yeah.

1294
01:05:56.006 --> 01:05:58.007
Yeah.

1295
01:05:58.039 --> 01:05:59.207
. Was it ''Weeb'' or ''Weebee''?.
- ''Weebee.''


1296
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240
- That's all right.
- Sorry.


1297
01:06:00.273 --> 01:06:02.074
Well, most--Twin Galaxies
call me Wiebe, so...


1298
01:06:02.106 --> 01:06:03.106
Okay.

1299
01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:04.341
- And that's a common mistake.
- Is it?


1300
01:06:04.373 --> 01:06:05.674
Either that or ''Wibe.''

1301
01:06:05.706 --> 01:06:07.874
But at least, you got
the correct pronunciation.


1302
01:06:07.906 --> 01:06:08.973
Steve Wiebe is who
l wanted to be


1303
01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:10.807
when l grew up
playing Donkey Hong.


1304
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.907
He's quite the player.

1305
01:06:14.206 --> 01:06:18.577
#  Everybody knows
that the dice are loaded #


1306
01:06:18.606 --> 01:06:23.010
#  Everybody rolls
with their fingers crossed #


1307
01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:27.677
#  Everybody knows
the war is over #


1308
01:06:27.706 --> 01:06:32.177
#  Everybody knows
the good guys lost #


1309
01:06:32.206 --> 01:06:36.677
#  Everybody knows
the fight was fixed #


1310
01:06:36.706 --> 01:06:39.008
#  The poor stay poor #

1311
01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:41.208
#  The rich get rich #

1312
01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:46.178
#  That's how it goes #

1313
01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:48.141
#  Everybody knows #

1314
01:07:04.106 --> 01:07:05.574
Well, maybe they'd like it
if l lose.


1315
01:07:05.606 --> 01:07:08.275
l got to try losing some time.

1316
01:07:08.306 --> 01:07:11.475
Oh, l can break a million.
l've done it.


1317
01:07:11.506 --> 01:07:14.475
l've been on pace...
Two games l got to 850,


1318
01:07:14.506 --> 01:07:19.277
l thought l was gonna do it, and
l just got...just in a bind.


1319
01:07:19.306 --> 01:07:20.774
#  Is leaking #

1320
01:07:20.806 --> 01:07:25.143
#  Everybody knows
the captain lied #


1321
01:07:25.173 --> 01:07:30.011
#  Everybody got
this broken feelin' #


1322
01:07:30.039 --> 01:07:34.010
#  Like their father
or their dog just died #


1323
01:07:35.273 --> 01:07:37.575
Does this have my name
on the back or something?


1324
01:07:37.606 --> 01:07:38.640
What does it say?

1325
01:07:39.873 --> 01:07:42.976
lt says, ''You have a yearning
for perfection.''


1326
01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:48.709
Because he's
in, um, his own business,


1327
01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.341
it's very flexible for him.

1328
01:07:50.373 --> 01:07:53.476
He can go over to the school
for events.


1329
01:07:53.506 --> 01:07:55.241
He was at an Easter egg hunt
the other day.


1330
01:07:55.273 --> 01:07:57.174
'Cause he'll--he'll come
in the office someday


1331
01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:58.941
and they'll say,
''Geez, where is Billy today?''


1332
01:07:58.973 --> 01:08:00.107
''Billy's not here.''

1333
01:08:01.106 --> 01:08:03.608
l told him last night
that he had to come,


1334
01:08:03.639 --> 01:08:05.675
that there's no reason for him
not to be here.


1335
01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.908
He says, ''l have 15 reasons
why l can't come.''


1336
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:08.940
l said, ''They're all b.s.''

1337
01:08:08.973 --> 01:08:10.140
This is after 1:30
in the morning.


1338
01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:11.774
l said, ''They're all b.s.
'cause l have 15 reasons


1339
01:08:11.806 --> 01:08:13.474
why you have
to be here tomorrow.''


1340
01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.641
He had a chance to play him
in Funspot this year.


1341
01:08:15.673 --> 01:08:17.741
He had a chance to play him
in Pompano Beach.


1342
01:08:17.773 --> 01:08:21.977
He had a chance to play him
at California Extreme.


1343
01:08:22.006 --> 01:08:24.274
That's three of 'em
l can think of right there.


1344
01:08:24.306 --> 01:08:26.441
Why wouldn't he play
against Steve?


1345
01:08:26.473 --> 01:08:28.341
'Cause he's afraid
he's gonna lose.


1346
01:08:28.373 --> 01:08:32.744
l traveled 3,OOO miles
to give myself a chance


1347
01:08:32.773 --> 01:08:35.275
to get the world record
and be in Guinness.


1348
01:08:35.306 --> 01:08:39.576
l hope he can, at least,
come ten miles


1349
01:08:39.606 --> 01:08:42.275
and put his game on the line,
so you make the call.


1350
01:08:42.306 --> 01:08:44.141
Where are you?

1351
01:08:46.673 --> 01:08:48.207
All right, well, we're,
like, we're all here.


1352
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.909
We're all seated and getting
ready to order, so...


1353
01:08:53.139 --> 01:08:55.175
Um, okay, let me go down
the list here.


1354
01:08:55.206 --> 01:08:57.741
We got Tom Rodgers and his girl.

1355
01:08:57.773 --> 01:09:00.575
We got Shawn, Fran, Jason, and--

1356
01:09:18.706 --> 01:09:20.441
That's fair, isn't it?

1357
01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.541
Okay.

1358
01:09:31.773 --> 01:09:34.108
l'm real sorry he's not--
he didn't come.


1359
01:09:34.139 --> 01:09:35.241
- Bill?
- Yeah.


1360
01:09:35.273 --> 01:09:40.611
Well, you know,
Mark and Steve showed up


1361
01:09:40.639 --> 01:09:44.043
unexpectedly and uninvitedly,
but hard to keep them away.


1362
01:09:44.073 --> 01:09:45.073
Yeah.

1363
01:09:45.106 --> 01:09:47.308
And Bill just doesn't want
anything to do with him.


1364
01:09:47.339 --> 01:09:48.607
Yeah.

1365
01:09:49.839 --> 01:09:51.474
All right. See you.

1366
01:10:01.473 --> 01:10:03.274
He's got a plan,
so when he comes out


1367
01:10:03.306 --> 01:10:05.074
because Billy is Billy,
you know.


1368
01:10:05.106 --> 01:10:08.209
And he's gonna come out
with a bang.


1369
01:10:08.806 --> 01:10:10.707
Oh, Billy Mitchell
always has a plan.


1370
01:10:12.106 --> 01:10:13.707
- He likes to keep secrets.
- Yeah.


1371
01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.775
He likes surprising people.

1372
01:10:15.806 --> 01:10:19.009
He likes--He likes people
seein' him do the unexpected


1373
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.608
and say,
''Oh, boy, l didn't realize


1374
01:10:20.639 --> 01:10:21.974
- ''you were gonna do
something like that, Bill.''
- Yup.


1375
01:10:22.006 --> 01:10:23.240
That's how he is.

1376
01:10:23.273 --> 01:10:25.775
lt's annoying
when somebody's ahead of you.


1377
01:10:25.806 --> 01:10:26.840
You know, when you're not
the lead dog,


1378
01:10:26.873 --> 01:10:31.177
the view doesn't change, and l
always wanted the view, so...


1379
01:10:31.206 --> 01:10:33.074
He's got
the Roy Shildt excuse.


1380
01:10:33.106 --> 01:10:36.742
He's got--You know,
he's not gonna show up.


1381
01:10:36.773 --> 01:10:40.676
l've heard a lot of talk
of Billy Mitchell,


1382
01:10:40.706 --> 01:10:45.343
and l've heard a lot of talk
of strange videos and things.


1383
01:10:45.373 --> 01:10:49.777
But l haven't heard much
in the way of him


1384
01:10:49.806 --> 01:10:52.642
getting in front
of a camera crew or people


1385
01:10:52.673 --> 01:10:55.909
and winning a record
in front of people.


1386
01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.643
l haven't heard about that yet.
Maybe he did that 25 years ago.


1387
01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:01.541
But l haven't heard of him
doing it lately,


1388
01:11:01.573 --> 01:11:03.574
and it makes
you wonder why not.


1389
01:11:22.406 --> 01:11:23.940
We got him here.
He's here.


1390
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.808
Hey, Billy.

1391
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:10.908
Video games
are meant to be played


1392
01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:15.811
in a competitive environment,
under pressure, organized,


1393
01:12:15.839 --> 01:12:18.609
where you have to perform
literally on demand.


1394
01:12:22.106 --> 01:12:23.807
Never. Never.

1395
01:12:27.573 --> 01:12:31.076
And when you do that,
you have far more credibility


1396
01:12:31.106 --> 01:12:34.075
than someone who says,
''Oh, l did that last week.''


1397
01:12:34.106 --> 01:12:35.474
No matter
how good you play tennis,


1398
01:12:35.506 --> 01:12:37.241
no matter how good
you play golf,


1399
01:12:37.273 --> 01:12:39.408
if you don't play
when you have to play,


1400
01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.942
if you don't play
when the pressure's on,


1401
01:12:41.973 --> 01:12:44.208
you're really
not good enough.


1402
01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.677
#  Everybody knows
the deal is rotten #


1403
01:12:48.706 --> 01:12:52.643
#  Old black Joe's
still pickin' cotton #


1404
01:12:52.673 --> 01:12:55.175
#  For your ribbons and bows #

1405
01:12:55.206 --> 01:12:59.677
l can handle losing if he would,
at least, compete against me.


1406
01:12:59.706 --> 01:13:01.174
l'm not afraid to lose.

1407
01:13:01.206 --> 01:13:04.242
l'm just some no-name guy
from Washington.


1408
01:13:04.273 --> 01:13:07.576
Billy is trying to live up
to this image


1409
01:13:07.606 --> 01:13:10.742
of being the greatest ever in--

1410
01:13:10.773 --> 01:13:14.076
So he's afraid that if he loses,
that's gonna tarnish him.


1411
01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:19.076
Yeah, that was the game
before this.


1412
01:13:19.106 --> 01:13:22.542
#  But just a shining artifact
of the past #


1413
01:13:22.573 --> 01:13:26.543
#  Everybody knows
the scene is dead #


1414
01:13:26.573 --> 01:13:28.241
#  But there's gonna be a-- #

1415
01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:31.242
lt's been three days, man,

1416
01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:32.273
and the fatigue's
starting to set in,


1417
01:13:32.306 --> 01:13:35.742
this mentally,
this, you know,


1418
01:13:35.773 --> 01:13:39.343
starting over,
it takes a toll on you.


1419
01:13:40.106 --> 01:13:43.342
#  Everybody knows #

1420
01:13:45.006 --> 01:13:49.543
#  Everybody knows #

1421
01:13:49.573 --> 01:13:53.610
#  Everybody knows #

1422
01:13:53.639 --> 01:13:57.477
#  That's how it goes #

1423
01:13:58.139 --> 01:14:00.976
Steve Wiebe, l think,
is a very straight shooter.


1424
01:14:01.006 --> 01:14:03.608
This is the last day, isn't it?

1425
01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:07.510
l think that he gets influenced
sometimes by people,


1426
01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.708
and, uh...and that's probably
one of his lessons--


1427
01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.142
to be stronger in himself.

1428
01:14:12.173 --> 01:14:14.808
You know what l mean?
We all have lessons.


1429
01:14:18.573 --> 01:14:20.741
Thanks.
Yeah, l'm gonna break then.


1430
01:14:21.973 --> 01:14:24.141
Last start? Okay.

1431
01:14:25.006 --> 01:14:26.674
- Okay.
- So...


1432
01:14:27.673 --> 01:14:30.542
Oh, here it is.
This is the last shot.


1433
01:15:33.573 --> 01:15:36.175
l'm done.

1434
01:15:36.206 --> 01:15:38.541
- l'm done.
- Casualty.


1435
01:15:38.573 --> 01:15:40.741
lt's so heart-breaking.

1436
01:15:42.139 --> 01:15:44.842
l guess it's not even
about Donkey Hong anymore.


1437
01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.908
- It's--
- What's it about?


1438
01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.676
Just, uh--l don't know.

1439
01:15:49.706 --> 01:15:52.942
lt's become
just a game and trying--


1440
01:15:52.973 --> 01:15:56.109
for me, trying to get
a score recognized...


1441
01:15:56.806 --> 01:16:01.377
and trying to beat this empire
that l'm trying


1442
01:16:01.406 --> 01:16:05.343
to break through
and get a fair chance.


1443
01:16:05.373 --> 01:16:09.543
'Cause he is not cunning
and manipulative and mean.


1444
01:16:09.573 --> 01:16:11.841
He is
a decent person at heart.


1445
01:16:12.839 --> 01:16:16.109
ln the end,
that's all that matters.


1446
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.608
ln a funny sort of way,
it's like being the king


1447
01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:31.975
and having the advisers
speak their opinions


1448
01:16:32.006 --> 01:16:35.109
but then trying to choose
the right answer


1449
01:16:35.139 --> 01:16:37.942
and the right path of action
based on the advice.


1450
01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.609
l think that Steve Wiebe has
to be viewed on his own merit


1451
01:16:43.639 --> 01:16:48.111
and not on anything alleged
which may have happened.


1452
01:16:48.139 --> 01:16:50.609
Steve Wiebe feels fine to me.
Doesn't he to you?


1453
01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:52.975
Steve Wiebe,
could you come up here?


1454
01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.308
- Is it Steve ''Weebee''?
- Yeah. ''Weebee.''


1455
01:16:58.339 --> 01:16:59.340
- All right.
- That's okay.


1456
01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:02.342
For some reason, l keep thinking
it's ''Weeb.'' Sorry.


1457
01:17:02.373 --> 01:17:04.775
The thing about Steve
is Steve is special.


1458
01:17:04.806 --> 01:17:06.073
Steve has gone through
a long history


1459
01:17:06.106 --> 01:17:08.708
that don't need
to burden you with,


1460
01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:09.807
but l just
wanted to tell you that


1461
01:17:09.839 --> 01:17:11.141
l wanted to congratulate you

1462
01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:14.242
and shake your hand again,
that as far as l'm concerned,


1463
01:17:14.273 --> 01:17:16.108
you are a top player,

1464
01:17:16.139 --> 01:17:18.475
worthy of the highest regard
from Twin Galaxies,


1465
01:17:18.506 --> 01:17:21.141
and we're very honored
to receive your videotapes


1466
01:17:21.173 --> 01:17:23.642
at any time you wanna
record them and send them to us


1467
01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:24.940
because we think, uh...

1468
01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.008
We think your skill set
is on the highest level,


1469
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.176
and you're a member
of the family and you're great.


1470
01:17:30.206 --> 01:17:31.807
And so you're okay.
You're great, You're--


1471
01:17:31.839 --> 01:17:33.775
- You make me feel--uh, really...
- You're a great performer.


1472
01:17:33.806 --> 01:17:35.374
Whoo!

1473
01:17:40.306 --> 01:17:44.576
l can only speak for myself,
but l--l've talked with Steve,


1474
01:17:44.606 --> 01:17:46.174
l talked to his wife,
l talked to his kids,


1475
01:17:46.206 --> 01:17:48.808
l've met with him,
talked to him in detail.


1476
01:17:48.839 --> 01:17:51.742
And speaking for myself,
l have no question


1477
01:17:51.773 --> 01:17:56.277
about his integrity,
his ability, or anything else.


1478
01:17:56.306 --> 01:17:59.475
l mean, he's proven himself not
just as a Donkey Hong player,


1479
01:17:59.506 --> 01:18:01.374
but really as a person of--

1480
01:18:01.406 --> 01:18:04.575
of somebody who really desires
to do the right thing.


1481
01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:07.274
You agree with--l mean, his--

1482
01:18:07.306 --> 01:18:08.373
l'm not familiar enough
with the situation.


1483
01:18:08.406 --> 01:18:10.608
Okay.

1484
01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:21.876
l feel l won, that l tried,

1485
01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:24.908
and l hope people
will remember it, you know,


1486
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:28.610
this--empty his name tag here.

1487
01:18:36.306 --> 01:18:39.742
After l returned from the trip,
Walter e-mailed me


1488
01:18:39.773 --> 01:18:41.808
and had these words:

1489
01:18:41.839 --> 01:18:44.676
''Steve, your Donkey Hong
accomplishment was fantastic.


1490
01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.608
''After soul searching,
we at Twin Galaxies


1491
01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:50.509
''wish to apologize to you for
such inconsiderate treatment.


1492
01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.942
''We look forward
to your future exploits


1493
01:18:52.973 --> 01:18:53.973
''and are excited

1494
01:18:54.006 --> 01:18:55.674
''about the amazing
high-score breakthroughs


1495
01:18:55.706 --> 01:18:58.141
''you'll be bringing
to the Donkey Hong community.


1496
01:18:58.173 --> 01:19:00.174
Blessings and friendship.
Walter Day.''


1497
01:19:00.206 --> 01:19:04.343
So that's his, um...

1498
01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:09.244
the way he wanted to bring peace
