00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:51.660
All units,
all frequencies, stand by.


2
00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:54.411
Repeat--all units,
all frequencies, stand by.


3
00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.409
All 16-Adam units, stand by.
CHP are in pursuit.


4
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.415
Westbound 210 Freeway
approaching Paxton.


5
00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.686
Westbound 210 Freeway
approaching Paxton.


6
00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:15.244
16-Adam-12 reports vehicle is
in excess of 100 miles an hour.


7
00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:18.133
Vehicle is exiting
the freeway at Paxton.


8
00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:21.100
Repeat--vehicle is exiting
the freeway at Paxton.


9
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.586
Suspect is wanted for evading.

10
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:32.212
All units stand by.

11
00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:11.750
It has been more than a year
since the Rodney King beating.


12
00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:14.466
The twelve jurors in the trial
of the four white officers...


13
00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:16.391
have just returned
with a verdict...


14
00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:18.246
after deliberating
for several days.


15
00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:22.274
The four officers accused of
assaulting Rodney King...


16
00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:24.256
are on the way to the courthouse
here in Simi Valley...


17
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.738
along with their lawyers.

18
00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:28.040
As soon as they get here,
the judge will call the jury...


19
00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.351
back into the courtroom...

20
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.275
and the clerk will begin
to read the verdicts.


21
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.511
We expect it will happen
very, very soon.


22
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.337
On the other side
of the courthouse...


23
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.998
a large crowd is developing.

24
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.243
These are people who have
been monitoring this trial.


25
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.279
They are anxious to find out
what the verdict is.


26
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:38.780
There it is. Come on.

27
00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:40.507
Hang a "U." Turn around.

28
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:42.778
Jack O'Hearts. That's it.

29
00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.223
They ain't getting off.

30
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.713
The jury
don't have fucking eyes?


31
00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:49.274
Rodney King's
getting his ass beaten, man.


32
00:03:49.348 --> 00:03:51.039
They beating the black
out of homeboy's ass.


33
00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:52.996
Bust me.

34
00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:54.489
You ragweed-mouth motherfucker.

35
00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:56.736
Check this shit out.
I wouldn't give a fuck...


36
00:03:56.806 --> 00:03:58.530
if it was motherfucking
Martin Luther King...


37
00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.356
got clapped off, nigga,
it don't matter.


38
00:04:00.424 --> 00:04:02.595
Ain't no brothers on
that jury out there, fucker.


39
00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:04.038
It's Simi Valley.

40
00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:05.698
All good, decent white folk
like yourself.


41
00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.388
That's why they moved the venue.
The cops are protected.


42
00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:11.590
It's on videotape.
You can't fuck with that.


43
00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.514
They going down.

44
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.029
If they go down, I'll buy you
some old-fashioned black pussy.


45
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:20.899
If them motherfuckers walk,
you gotta spot me a ho.


46
00:04:20.973 --> 00:04:24.717
And no white ho.
I want a Puerto Rican.


47
00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:26.605
Where you gonna find
a Puerto Rican in L.A.?


48
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.915
I'll get you some Mexican shit.

49
00:04:27.983 --> 00:04:30.220
I don't want
no clumsy-ass Mexican.


50
00:04:30.288 --> 00:04:32.624
I want me a badass
Puerto Rican bitch.


51
00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:35.592
I don't give a fuck
if you gotta swim.


52
00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:39.911
Let's shake.
It's about that time.


53
00:04:42.772 --> 00:04:44.945
We do this
short, simple, and clean.


54
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.452
Detective Keough...

55
00:05:15.518 --> 00:05:17.819
if you had
a little time machine...


56
00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:20.276
and you could travel back
to the day of the shooting...


57
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:22.938
to the afternoon that
you killed Mr. Robertson...


58
00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:25.528
I'd like to hear what
you'd do differently.


59
00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:49.504
I wouldn't do
anything differently, sir.


60
00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:51.966
He drew down on me.
I did what I was trained to do.


61
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.911
If anything, sir,
I should've acted quicker.


62
00:05:54.985 --> 00:05:58.304
The last man Robertson pulled
a gun on isn't with us anymore.


63
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.097
Thank you, Detective.

64
00:06:21.332 --> 00:06:24.495
I think we've kept
Detective Keough long enough.


65
00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:27.018
Chief Barcomb,
I have a few questions.


66
00:06:29.588 --> 00:06:31.825
Fire away, Chief Holland.

67
00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:34.414
I know it's been a long day...

68
00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:37.072
and I know those chairs
aren't well-padded...


69
00:06:37.143 --> 00:06:39.184
so I promise to be quick.

70
00:06:44.057 --> 00:06:45.234
You OK?

71
00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:50.188
Three weeks in SlS...

72
00:07:50.252 --> 00:07:52.074
and you've made your first kill.

73
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.083
Would you say
you've proven yourself?


74
00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.297
Respectfully, sir...

75
00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:59.148
I think the shooting board
has to decide that.


76
00:08:00.752 --> 00:08:02.661
Do you think
it could've been avoided?


77
00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:04.558
No, sir, I don't.

78
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.765
It says here
that you and your partner...


79
00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:08.460
had Mr. Robertson
bumper-locked...


80
00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:10.188
for two days
before the shooting.


81
00:08:10.258 --> 00:08:12.331
Why didn't you bust him
for the weapon?


82
00:08:12.403 --> 00:08:15.306
Because we weren't sure
he had the weapon.


83
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.349
The informant who told us
is highly unreliable.


84
00:08:18.422 --> 00:08:22.383
But you tailed him anyway
for 680 man-hours.


85
00:08:22.453 --> 00:08:25.837
He was on parole.
You could've shaken him down...


86
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:30.385
but you let a two-time felon
stroll around downtown L.A...


87
00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:33.010
with a.357 Magnum
stuck in his jeans.


88
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:35.570
Why? Why?

89
00:08:35.642 --> 00:08:40.400
We didn't want to get him
on a bullshit weapons charge.


90
00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:43.379
Thank you, Chief Holland.
We have to wrap it up.


91
00:08:43.453 --> 00:08:46.683
Officer Garcia, will you bring
Sergeant Perry in?


92
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.889
Sergeant Perry, we're not quite
through beating up on you.


93
00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.999
I have one final question
before we adjourn.


94
00:08:55.072 --> 00:08:56.316
Time machine, sir?

95
00:08:56.384 --> 00:08:58.393
Yes, the time machine.

96
00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:00.833
Chief, I'd get real proactive.

97
00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:02.752
If I had a time machine...

98
00:09:02.818 --> 00:09:05.535
I'd go back a decade
and take out G-Bone--


99
00:09:05.603 --> 00:09:09.433
his street name--
before he killed a man for $10.


100
00:09:09.508 --> 00:09:13.405
The time machine
doesn't go back that far.


101
00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:14.722
It goes back one week...

102
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:18.502
to the day Detective Keough
chose to use deadly force.


103
00:09:18.568 --> 00:09:20.988
What would you change
about that day only?


104
00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:23.845
Nothing, sir.
It was textbook.


105
00:09:23.912 --> 00:09:26.695
The bullets were
in the bad guys, not us.


106
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:29.609
We expect department personnel
to use deadly force--


107
00:09:29.674 --> 00:09:33.253
Only as a last resort,
which it was, sir.


108
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.495
Bobby Keough's a good cop
with a lot of potential...


109
00:09:35.564 --> 00:09:37.637
and he dropped
a menace to society.


110
00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:39.083
It was a good call.

111
00:09:39.148 --> 00:09:40.676
Thank you.

112
00:09:40.749 --> 00:09:43.598
Thank you, Sergeant Perry,
Detective Keough.


113
00:09:43.662 --> 00:09:45.354
You gentlemen are dismissed.

114
00:09:45.423 --> 00:09:47.245
We'll issue our findings
at 9 A.M. tomorrow morning.


115
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:49.647
Proceedings are closed.

116
00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.027
Call me.

117
00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:09.364
It is the second
full day of deliberations...


118
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.740
in the Rodney King
beating trial.


119
00:10:10.807 --> 00:10:12.880
No word on when the jury
might reach a decision.


120
00:10:12.952 --> 00:10:16.269
Reporters, photographers and
news media covering this case...


121
00:10:16.345 --> 00:10:19.543
are sitting in the parking lot
of the courthouse...


122
00:10:19.609 --> 00:10:22.327
waiting until we get word
that there is a verdict.


123
00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:25.242
Reporting live from
the Simi Valley courthouse in--


124
00:10:25.307 --> 00:10:28.472
They should've wasted that
worthless motherfucker's ass.


125
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.158
Here. Settle your stomach.

126
00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:32.658
Thanks, Jack.

127
00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:35.155
-How'd my nephew perform?
-He aced it.


128
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.499
Say hello to the department's
new poster boy.


129
00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:38.876
No, I'm telling you,
I'll get suspended.


130
00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:42.425
I'll end up being a fucking
security guard at Taco Bell.


131
00:10:42.497 --> 00:10:44.089
Bobby, you go down,
I go down.


132
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:45.852
I go down, Jack goes down.

133
00:10:45.922 --> 00:10:47.100
And Jack ain't going down...

134
00:10:47.172 --> 00:10:48.599
so have some faith
in the system.


135
00:10:48.674 --> 00:10:49.786
A man is supposed
to be nervous...


136
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:50.971
in front of
his first shooting board.


137
00:10:51.043 --> 00:10:54.240
Listen, kid.
Here's my advice...


138
00:10:54.308 --> 00:10:56.064
for what it's worth.

139
00:10:56.132 --> 00:10:58.141
-Live with it!
-Jesus Christ.


140
00:10:58.212 --> 00:11:00.832
-Good hands!
-Held on to it.


141
00:11:00.902 --> 00:11:03.140
I'm never going
to live it down, am l?


142
00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:06.083
Don't go getting
sad and weepy on us.


143
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.323
One mistake means you're human.

144
00:11:08.392 --> 00:11:10.629
Two mistakes means you're fired.

145
00:11:10.695 --> 00:11:13.600
Holy shit.
It's a royal visit.


146
00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:15.081
Look what descended
from the sixth floor.


147
00:11:15.146 --> 00:11:16.641
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Jack.


148
00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:18.504
How are you holding up, son?

149
00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:19.781
I'm good, sir.

150
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:22.602
You should've seen this kid.
He was outstanding.


151
00:11:22.668 --> 00:11:24.872
Ever thought about doing
a tour with public affairs?


152
00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:27.909
We could use a good-looking
son of a bitch like you.


153
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:29.870
He's a good young cop, Jimmy,
and he's mine.


154
00:11:29.935 --> 00:11:33.383
Well, I tried.

155
00:11:33.456 --> 00:11:35.594
The board voted.

156
00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:44.617
In policy.

157
00:11:46.322 --> 00:11:47.753
You're off the hook, kid.

158
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:49.868
-There you go.
-Congratulations.


159
00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:52.397
Have a cigar.

160
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.965
The report will be ready
in the morning.


161
00:11:54.038 --> 00:11:55.862
You guys can get back
into the field.


162
00:11:55.927 --> 00:12:01.645
So, the vote...

163
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.445
The vote was four to one.

164
00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:06.514
What? Who the fuck
pissed backwards--Holland?


165
00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:08.277
Affirmatron.

166
00:12:08.347 --> 00:12:10.454
I'd like to see
his bald-headed black ass...


167
00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:12.347
back in a radio car
in South Central.


168
00:12:12.413 --> 00:12:13.875
We don't need that shit.

169
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:15.772
He actually said
"out of policy"?


170
00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:19.001
Holland began contacting
outside agencies a month ago.


171
00:12:19.068 --> 00:12:23.576
He's doing civil service testing
with the city of Cleveland.


172
00:12:23.646 --> 00:12:27.161
He's leaving to run their P.D.
Didn't hear it from me.


173
00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:28.443
Didn't hear it from you.

174
00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.487
Fuck Holland. Good riddance.

175
00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:32.569
Have to pin his stars
on another brother...


176
00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:33.984
or the community
will go apeshit.


177
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.222
Jesus, Eldon,
you sound like your old man.


178
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.813
-It's true.
-It's not such a bad thing.


179
00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:42.496
Everything I know--his old man.

180
00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:44.770
A toast to Bobby.
Right between the eyes.


181
00:12:46.758 --> 00:12:49.148
Thank you, guys. I mean it.

182
00:12:49.223 --> 00:12:52.670
Thanks for giving me the chance
to prove myself in SlS.


183
00:12:52.743 --> 00:12:55.394
Amen, Bobby.
To Jack's squad.


184
00:12:58.025 --> 00:13:00.993
Eldon, Jimmy has something
to tell you.


185
00:13:01.066 --> 00:13:02.343
You made lieutenant.

186
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.419
You're next
on the transfer list.


187
00:13:04.491 --> 00:13:06.248
Fuck you, too, Jimmy.

188
00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:09.317
No. We're not pulling your dick.

189
00:13:12.174 --> 00:13:14.182
It's about fucking time.

190
00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:16.589
It's about fucking time!
All right!


191
00:13:16.654 --> 00:13:18.694
Where's my badge?

192
00:13:18.767 --> 00:13:21.102
The badge ceremony's
Wednesday at the Academy.


193
00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:22.892
A dozen lieutenants
being promoted.


194
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.783
The biggest
in department history...


195
00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:27.752
if you can make it on time,
Mr. Smart Ass.


196
00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:30.510
I'll try to shove it
into my busy schedule.


197
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.198
Thanks for dropping by.

198
00:13:34.612 --> 00:13:36.335
Thanks for the cigars, Jimmy.

199
00:13:36.404 --> 00:13:38.576
-Good luck, kid.
-Thank you.


200
00:13:38.645 --> 00:13:39.757
We'll hoist a few next week.

201
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.685
That'd be good, 
Jack, anytime.

202
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:43.158
Looking forward to it.

203
00:13:48.664 --> 00:13:50.160
That's our next chief,
gentlemen.


204
00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:52.121
That's a scary fucking thought.

205
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.121
I mean-
-God help us.

206
00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:16.983
I can't stand much more
of that dump.


207
00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:19.611
Did you see that drunk
tonight trying to paw me?


208
00:14:19.682 --> 00:14:20.992
What drunk?

209
00:14:21.058 --> 00:14:22.880
Does it matter, what drunk?

210
00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.729
What's the matter
with you tonight, darling?


211
00:14:25.795 --> 00:14:29.245
That's the third time you
started to tell me something.


212
00:14:29.316 --> 00:14:31.357
We shouldn't have any secrets
from each other, Sue.


213
00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:34.560
You're a fucking alcoholic.

214
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.113
Thanks.

215
00:14:38.184 --> 00:14:40.388
There's goulash in the crockpot.

216
00:14:41.993 --> 00:14:43.881
I'm not hungry.

217
00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:55.812
Did you just get home?

218
00:14:55.885 --> 00:14:58.056
Eleven prisoners
got early releases.


219
00:14:58.124 --> 00:15:00.067
I had to process them out.

220
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.387
Sal...

221
00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:15.052
I made lieutenant.

222
00:15:18.994 --> 00:15:20.936
You're kidding.

223
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:26.357
-Finally.
-Yeah.


224
00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:28.277
When will it show up
on your paycheck?


225
00:15:28.343 --> 00:15:30.384
Not till
after the ceremony, honey.


226
00:15:30.455 --> 00:15:33.587
Who the fuck
is calling 900 numbers?


227
00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:36.407
If it's anyone, it's you,
and you don't remember.


228
00:15:36.473 --> 00:15:38.579
The department tapes
for manual labor.


229
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.690
Watch this.
It's the damn kid.


230
00:15:41.851 --> 00:15:43.444
Welcome to
Sorority Slut Hot Line.


231
00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:45.850
Yeah. Sorority Slut Hot Line.

232
00:15:45.917 --> 00:15:49.878
Fucking pay it.
At least he's not a fag.


233
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.607
No, he's not a fag.

234
00:15:51.677 --> 00:15:53.751
Your damn kid has a girlfriend.

235
00:15:53.822 --> 00:15:55.645
Know that, Detective?

236
00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:57.622
No. No shit?

237
00:15:57.696 --> 00:16:00.217
She's very pretty, very sweet.

238
00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:04.218
That's excellent.
The boy's finding his dick.


239
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.291
I work in a jail. Do I have
to listen to that at home?


240
00:16:07.362 --> 00:16:08.770
OK, OK.

241
00:16:12.196 --> 00:16:14.204
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:16.481
Aren't you going to ask
how the shooting board went?


243
00:16:18.854 --> 00:16:21.276
Aren't you
going to at least ask me...


244
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:23.588
how the shooting board went?

245
00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:24.833
I'm sorry, honey.

246
00:16:24.904 --> 00:16:27.271
I have a hard time keeping
track of all your shootings...


247
00:16:27.335 --> 00:16:31.396
and investigations and
interrogations and inquiries.


248
00:16:31.466 --> 00:16:33.126
How did your shooting board go?

249
00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:36.097
-ln policy.
-Like it would be anything else.


250
00:16:36.172 --> 00:16:38.246
What is this?
I recognize this.


251
00:16:38.316 --> 00:16:40.651
I've seen it before somewhere.

252
00:16:40.718 --> 00:16:43.401
Bobby's strutting around
like a little bantam rooster.


253
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.853
You're just jealous of him
because he's cute.


254
00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:54.414
Cute.

255
00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:56.848
You are so lost in space...

256
00:16:56.913 --> 00:17:00.656
you have no idea
what the fuck's going on.


257
00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:02.795
Jealous of Bobby?

258
00:17:02.867 --> 00:17:04.940
Bobby's a fucking coward.

259
00:17:05.012 --> 00:17:06.540
Bobby's not a coward.

260
00:17:06.612 --> 00:17:07.921
He's not?

261
00:17:09.301 --> 00:17:10.546
OK.

262
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.349
Chicken shit.

263
00:17:14.422 --> 00:17:18.068
Let me tell you how that
Robertson case really went down.


264
00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:21.332
My gun's gotta cool, because
I blasted that freak in Pacoima.


265
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.962
It's time Bobby gets tested.

266
00:17:23.033 --> 00:17:24.462
We're out there
in this alley waiting.


267
00:17:24.538 --> 00:17:26.546
Robertson comes running out,
smacks into Bobby.


268
00:17:26.617 --> 00:17:28.505
They eyeball each other
with their shit hanging out.


269
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.190
Robertson says, "Boo,"
Bobby drops his gun...


270
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.083
and Mandingo goes track star.

271
00:17:33.149 --> 00:17:36.924
Bobby dropped his fucking gun.

272
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.779
I don't want to hear this.

273
00:17:38.846 --> 00:17:40.734
No, listen,
because this is good.


274
00:17:40.798 --> 00:17:42.393
So, I reach down,
I pick up Bobby's gun...


275
00:17:42.463 --> 00:17:43.838
and I go, "Hey, yo, G
-Dog!"

276
00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:45.791
Or GQ, or whatever
the fuck his name is.


277
00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.384
He turns around and-
-Boom!

278
00:17:47.457 --> 00:17:50.457
I split this guy's eyeballs.
It was a lucky shot.


279
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.248
The point is, I let Bobby
take the triggerman slot...


280
00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:55.868
to save his ass
from big-time embarrassment!


281
00:17:55.939 --> 00:17:58.274
How do you like that for "cute"?

282
00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.770
Fuck.

283
00:18:13.832 --> 00:18:16.964
Fuck it.
Goulash? Oh, boy.


284
00:18:20.394 --> 00:18:23.178
And you wonder why I drink.

285
00:18:38.064 --> 00:18:40.269
Jesus Christ.

286
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.447
Is that all you got?

287
00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:55.348
Yeah, for now.
For the moment.


288
00:18:57.589 --> 00:18:59.565
Man, you sure you're a cop?

289
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.007
Just call me Sarge.

290
00:19:02.072 --> 00:19:03.665
But no last name.

291
00:19:05.304 --> 00:19:09.779
We've known each other for
three weeks without last names.


292
00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:12.949
I'm afraid if you tell me,
you're going to...


293
00:19:13.017 --> 00:19:15.025
What? Turn into a pumpkin?

294
00:19:15.098 --> 00:19:17.915
Something like that.

295
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.534
-Want to know my last name?
-No.


296
00:19:22.364 --> 00:19:25.180
No, I don't want to know
your last name...


297
00:19:25.246 --> 00:19:28.957
your division, your partner.

298
00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:33.595
I like it like this.

299
00:19:33.665 --> 00:19:36.633
Nothing too serious...yet.

300
00:19:36.706 --> 00:19:40.798
What just happened
was pretty serious to me.


301
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:44.897
Ready to go again?

302
00:19:46.437 --> 00:19:48.325
Whatever you say, Sarge.

303
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.426
That's what
I'm talking about--money.


304
00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:12.774
-Orchard! Sidwell!
-Did you hear that?


305
00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:15.527
Open up!
I know you're in there!


306
00:20:15.596 --> 00:20:17.802
Orchard! Sidwell!

307
00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:22.826
Where's the safe?

308
00:20:24.304 --> 00:20:25.680
Dump that shit.

309
00:20:25.744 --> 00:20:27.600
Where's the money?

310
00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:29.095
Give me all the money now...

311
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.210
or I'll put you
back in your cages.


312
00:20:35.989 --> 00:20:37.876
-This it?
-Yeah.


313
00:20:39.317 --> 00:20:41.040
What about our half?

314
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:43.117
I'm keeping your half...

315
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.564
because you couldn't
control yourselves.


316
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.802
Why did you dumb fucks
kill those people?


317
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:48.278
What the fuck you think?

318
00:20:48.343 --> 00:20:51.126
We're gonna let people walk out
after they've seen us?


319
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:53.014
I don't give a fuck.

320
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.121
You live and breathe
and walk the streets...


321
00:20:55.193 --> 00:20:56.885
because of me and me alone.

322
00:20:56.954 --> 00:20:58.384
You know that, don't you?

323
00:20:58.458 --> 00:20:59.603
Yes, sir.

324
00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.683
Yes, sir.

325
00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:04.985
Your whore is dead.
Dump her, too.


326
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.826
Get off your asses.

327
00:21:24.898 --> 00:21:27.070
I'm putting you
in a fresh-blood case.


328
00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:29.311
There was a quadruple homicide
on Jefferson yesterday.


329
00:21:29.379 --> 00:21:31.386
Two coloreds
fucked up a robbery.


330
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.573
Monkeyshines.
Why call us in?


331
00:21:32.645 --> 00:21:35.963
The shit fairy paid me a visit.
It's rolling downhill.


332
00:21:36.038 --> 00:21:37.980
I hate it when
the shit fairy visits.


333
00:21:38.055 --> 00:21:39.878
One of the vic's
was an LAPD dispatcher.


334
00:21:39.943 --> 00:21:41.220
I got four bodies in the morgue.

335
00:21:41.288 --> 00:21:42.979
This Rodney King shit
has the department...


336
00:21:43.049 --> 00:21:44.674
on the ropes,
so get these gorillas.


337
00:21:44.744 --> 00:21:46.720
Show the world
LAPD looks after its own.


338
00:21:46.793 --> 00:21:47.971
Eldon, can we do this?

339
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:50.114
Sure, Jack, we can do this.

340
00:21:50.187 --> 00:21:52.523
Help the guys out
in South Bureau.


341
00:21:52.587 --> 00:21:54.791
Peltz and Sapin.
They're overworked.


342
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.933
They'll be happy
if SlS take point on this.


343
00:21:57.005 --> 00:21:59.461
-Bobby.
-Yes, sir.


344
00:21:59.534 --> 00:22:01.477
This could be
a second chance for you.


345
00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.957
I hope so, sir.

346
00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:13.100
What's the deal
with this new girl, Bobby?


347
00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:14.598
What are you talking about?

348
00:22:14.673 --> 00:22:16.365
I am a detective.
Give me some credit.


349
00:22:16.434 --> 00:22:18.540
-What's her name?
-Beth.


350
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:21.458
-What's she do?
-I don't know.


351
00:22:21.522 --> 00:22:23.279
She works in the building.

352
00:22:23.347 --> 00:22:25.104
Bullshit. She's a cop.

353
00:22:25.172 --> 00:22:27.442
I bet she's
the only blue suiter...


354
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.898
who didn't drop her drawers
when you flashed your shield...


355
00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:31.437
and now you're intrigued.

356
00:22:31.512 --> 00:22:34.808
I'm more than intrigued.
Remember the stenographer?


357
00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:39.407
Bobby, don't do that.
You fucking idiot.


358
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.231
You'll regret that
when you're my age.


359
00:22:42.296 --> 00:22:44.152
I'm sure I will.

360
00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:47.699
The latest now on
the Rodney King beating trial...


361
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:50.620
Hey, Lefty. Let's see.

362
00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:53.019
I'll have a...

363
00:22:54.238 --> 00:22:57.052
-Couple of coffees, regular.
-Two black coffees.


364
00:22:57.118 --> 00:22:59.574
-Can we turn this shit down?
-Thanks, man.


365
00:22:59.647 --> 00:23:01.076
Guys, getting your swerve on?

366
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:02.613
Eldon, what's shaking?

367
00:23:04.096 --> 00:23:05.307
No, that's fine.

368
00:23:05.377 --> 00:23:07.450
So, how's Sally?

369
00:23:07.521 --> 00:23:09.408
Sal? She's my angel.

370
00:23:09.473 --> 00:23:11.361
What brings you south of King?

371
00:23:11.426 --> 00:23:13.761
Please tell me
Jack gave you our case.


372
00:23:13.827 --> 00:23:15.321
Van Meter's all over this one.

373
00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:17.054
He wants us
to help you guys out.


374
00:23:17.123 --> 00:23:18.717
Eldon, it's dog shit.

375
00:23:18.788 --> 00:23:20.644
It's crazy-man stuff.

376
00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:24.288
These dumbasses hotfooted it
without tapping the till.


377
00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:25.985
Hypes or cranksters.
They gotta be ex-cons.


378
00:23:26.055 --> 00:23:27.944
-Any wits?
-The fifth victim.


379
00:23:28.008 --> 00:23:29.218
Did you interview him?

380
00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:31.525
No. He's in surgery
at Drew King.


381
00:23:31.592 --> 00:23:33.284
Metro's on him 24 hours.

382
00:23:33.353 --> 00:23:36.387
That's all we know.
You're welcome to it.


383
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:37.538
All right, partner.

384
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.269
Gentlemen,
thanks for the help.


385
00:23:39.338 --> 00:23:41.478
-Thanks a lot, guys.
-You bet.


386
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.813
Keep ducking.

387
00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:57.392
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.


388
00:23:57.456 --> 00:24:01.550
They called again about
the shooting board report.


389
00:24:01.618 --> 00:24:04.718
Send it back
without my endorsement.


390
00:24:04.787 --> 00:24:06.860
Attach this cover letter.

391
00:24:12.372 --> 00:24:14.129
Do you know what you're doing?

392
00:24:14.198 --> 00:24:15.572
Declaring war.

393
00:24:15.638 --> 00:24:18.672
That's crazy. You can't upstage
a hard-ass like Van Meter.


394
00:24:18.743 --> 00:24:22.487
He has a weak spot-
-Eldon Perry.

395
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.896
Weak don't come to mind
when I think of that redneck.


396
00:24:28.698 --> 00:24:30.292
Perry and
his little partner...


397
00:24:30.363 --> 00:24:32.185
Iied through their teeth
for eight hours straight.


398
00:24:32.251 --> 00:24:34.772
Perry killed Robertson,
not his partner...


399
00:24:34.845 --> 00:24:36.471
and I'm going to prove it.

400
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:39.192
I'm going to get their badges.
Will you help me?


401
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:41.748
Whatever you want.

402
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.782
I need copies of every piece of
paper with Perry's name on it.


403
00:24:49.857 --> 00:24:52.574
Every ratings report,
every division log...


404
00:24:52.642 --> 00:24:55.512
payroll, medical,
commendations, everything.


405
00:24:55.585 --> 00:24:58.304
His partner, too.

406
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:00.956
Arthur, this is
some dangerous shit.


407
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:34.060
Sailboats--
I don't understand them.


408
00:25:34.126 --> 00:25:36.165
I prefer a big boat
with a big motor...


409
00:25:36.238 --> 00:25:38.180
on a big lake
behind a big dam.


410
00:25:38.254 --> 00:25:41.191
How about you, Arthur?
You a motor or sail guy?


411
00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:43.336
I don't like boats,
and I don't like you.


412
00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:45.613
Has this department
been so bad to you...


413
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:47.537
you feel driven
to humiliate it?


414
00:25:47.602 --> 00:25:50.091
Don't hide behind LAPD blue.

415
00:25:50.163 --> 00:25:51.790
It's not your color.

416
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.249
No one buys
your sudden transformation...


417
00:25:54.323 --> 00:25:57.293
into this beacon of higher
consciousness and moral right.


418
00:25:57.365 --> 00:26:00.235
The last thing your ham-fisted
political ploy...


419
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.772
will get you is four stars.

420
00:26:01.847 --> 00:26:05.143
You should rethink this--
very seriously.


421
00:26:05.208 --> 00:26:07.347
Very seriously.

422
00:26:07.416 --> 00:26:09.784
I know how you fight.

423
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:14.863
I'm ready for you.

424
00:26:14.938 --> 00:26:17.557
We can handle this
like gentlemen...


425
00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:20.116
or we can get into
some nigger shit.


426
00:26:20.188 --> 00:26:23.451
So you do whatever it is
you feel you have to do.


427
00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:27.613
I plan to, nigger.

428
00:26:59.304 --> 00:27:00.798
They didn't get a dime?

429
00:27:02.377 --> 00:27:05.343
No. They're crazy.

430
00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:06.877
They shoot and run.

431
00:27:06.952 --> 00:27:10.118
They're like dogs.
They have no heart.


432
00:27:10.185 --> 00:27:11.397
No, sir, they don't.

433
00:27:11.467 --> 00:27:13.769
You have any problems
with anybody in particular...


434
00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:16.587
in the neighborhood--
any troublemakers?


435
00:27:18.093 --> 00:27:20.069
No video, huh?

436
00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:22.116
Camera not work.

437
00:27:24.398 --> 00:27:27.116
What's upstairs there,
apartment?


438
00:27:27.183 --> 00:27:29.486
I live with my daughter.

439
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:33.994
My wife...

440
00:27:34.066 --> 00:27:35.954
We married 22 years.

441
00:27:42.452 --> 00:27:46.644
Mr. Kim, we will get the guys
that did this.


442
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:50.869
Give me a call
if there's anything you need.


443
00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:53.937
-We're here to help.
-Thank you.


444
00:27:55.802 --> 00:27:58.901
Please. Excuse me.

445
00:27:58.969 --> 00:28:00.083
It's all right, man.

446
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.382
What are you doing?

447
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:05.076
I'm just getting a feel
for the scene.


448
00:28:05.147 --> 00:28:06.709
How'd it go down, Sherlock?

449
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.859
I don't get it.

450
00:28:07.932 --> 00:28:10.748
One suspect kills Mrs. Kim
and hops the counter.


451
00:28:10.813 --> 00:28:14.228
Shooter two pops each vic
as they walk in.


452
00:28:14.302 --> 00:28:15.383
This is what I don't get.

453
00:28:15.454 --> 00:28:17.179
He moves
the bodies over here...


454
00:28:17.247 --> 00:28:18.709
hiding them from the street.

455
00:28:18.783 --> 00:28:21.205
That must've taken some time.

456
00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:22.490
Keep going.

457
00:28:22.561 --> 00:28:23.936
All right.

458
00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:26.905
Outside they run into Mr. Lewis.

459
00:28:26.979 --> 00:28:28.834
One of them
shoots him in the neck.


460
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.590
They get into the car
and they're gone.


461
00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:33.311
I'm sorry.
That does not make any sense.


462
00:28:34.499 --> 00:28:36.093
It never does, Bobby.

463
00:28:36.163 --> 00:28:37.791
What do we do now?

464
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.163
Why don't you ask Mr. Kim
for a broom...


465
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.271
and bag everything
in this gutter for the lab?


466
00:28:42.342 --> 00:28:44.198
Let's get that gutter, too.

467
00:28:44.262 --> 00:28:45.507
Heads up.

468
00:29:08.782 --> 00:29:12.678
Let's jack these motherfuckers
and rattle some cages.


469
00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:18.251
-What's up, Maniac?
-Ain't nothing happening.


470
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:20.045
You know I be shaking it down.

471
00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:22.449
-Yeah.
-What it look like, man?


472
00:29:22.515 --> 00:29:26.444
I'm trying to get my paper,
that's what it is.


473
00:29:26.516 --> 00:29:28.938
Up against the wall, boys.
You know the drill.


474
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:30.441
Let's go.
Palms on the bricks.


475
00:29:30.517 --> 00:29:31.728
Man, we ain't do nothing.

476
00:29:31.798 --> 00:29:34.220
You, in the gorilla suit,
turn around.


477
00:29:34.294 --> 00:29:35.920
Turn the fuck around, man.

478
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.300
Man, I ain't do nothing.

479
00:29:37.367 --> 00:29:39.856
Think this bullet gives a shit
how tough you are?


480
00:29:39.928 --> 00:29:42.198
-You're under arrest.
-For what?


481
00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:43.693
Give me your elbow!
Don't do that!


482
00:29:43.769 --> 00:29:45.078
Hook him up. Let's go.

483
00:29:45.146 --> 00:29:46.356
Calm the fuck down, man.

484
00:29:46.426 --> 00:29:51.130
-Fuck you, man.
-Calm the fuck down!


485
00:29:51.196 --> 00:29:53.268
What the fuck I did?

486
00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.033
Why did you shoot my car?

487
00:29:55.101 --> 00:29:56.857
I ain't shoot
your fucking--Oh, man!


488
00:29:57.855 --> 00:29:59.830
Get in there.
Let's go, come on.


489
00:29:59.903 --> 00:30:02.324
Get down. Get in there.

490
00:30:06.848 --> 00:30:08.637
Man, that shit sting!

491
00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:10.232
I know, man, he's crazy.

492
00:30:10.304 --> 00:30:12.280
Just cooperate with us.
What's your name?


493
00:30:12.354 --> 00:30:14.721
Maniac, man.
They call me Maniac.


494
00:30:14.787 --> 00:30:16.097
Who the fuck are you, Metro?

495
00:30:16.163 --> 00:30:17.690
Yeah, we're Metro.
I'm Detective Smith.


496
00:30:17.764 --> 00:30:19.389
This is my homeboy,
Detective Jones.


497
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.987
Somebody dropped
a dime on you, big guy.


498
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.396
You robbed a liquor store
and dumped four good citizens.


499
00:30:23.461 --> 00:30:25.088
Now your ass is getting gassed.

500
00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:27.100
Why you running
that bullshit at me?


501
00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:28.703
How about this?

502
00:30:28.774 --> 00:30:30.848
You're fucking killing me
with that shit.


503
00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:33.374
I'll find an alley
and empty this can up his nose.


504
00:30:33.447 --> 00:30:35.204
He's fucking crazy, all right?

505
00:30:35.273 --> 00:30:38.174
-Man, fuck him!
-He'll do it again.


506
00:30:38.248 --> 00:30:41.065
-Tell us what you know.
-You talking about Mr. Kim?


507
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.952
He cool-ass people.

508
00:30:43.018 --> 00:30:45.223
He be throwing us out
with 40s and shit.


509
00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:47.463
We keep our eye out for him.

510
00:30:47.533 --> 00:30:49.868
Somebody came in blasting
the other day...


511
00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:51.461
on a civilian, man.
That shit ain't cool.


512
00:30:51.535 --> 00:30:52.942
Speak fucking English!

513
00:30:53.006 --> 00:30:55.340
He's a good dude, bro,
so we gonna handle this.


514
00:30:55.406 --> 00:30:58.125
Shut the fuck up.
I want to know who did this.


515
00:30:58.191 --> 00:30:59.753
If you help me
bring these guys down...


516
00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:01.199
I'll bust a doper
and give you his shit.


517
00:31:01.264 --> 00:31:05.160
Two motherfuckers
that ain't from around here.


518
00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:08.017
Somebody gonna get drunk
and brag about it.


519
00:31:08.082 --> 00:31:10.188
He went up against Mr. Kim
and did his wife.


520
00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:11.785
Why is somebody gonna do that?

521
00:31:11.858 --> 00:31:14.380
Because he a player.
He got game.


522
00:31:14.451 --> 00:31:17.355
Game? What's he play, golf?
Speak fucking English!


523
00:31:17.429 --> 00:31:20.561
Word on the street,
he got strip club...


524
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.452
Iadies and stuff like that.

525
00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:24.113
He selling
that flat-ass booty.


526
00:31:24.184 --> 00:31:26.640
You're telling me
fucking bedtime stories.


527
00:31:26.713 --> 00:31:29.495
Check it out, cop.

528
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.935
Hold still now.

529
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.423
This hurts a lot less
without a broken nose.


530
00:31:33.498 --> 00:31:36.149
I told you!
Kim's a straight-up gangster!


531
00:31:36.218 --> 00:31:38.707
He a pimp like that.

532
00:31:40.445 --> 00:31:42.868
I hope you're not
fucking with me, Maniac.


533
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.772
Ed, it's Detective Smith.

534
00:31:46.846 --> 00:31:48.887
Yeah. Do a make for me?

535
00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:52.789
Hyan Henry Kim.
D.O.B. 10-15-41.


536
00:31:56.931 --> 00:31:59.298
Yeah. Thanks, Ed.

537
00:32:00.771 --> 00:32:02.146
Kim's in the gang book.

538
00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:03.804
Suspicion of loan sharking
and pandering.


539
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:06.079
He's got a club on Olympic,
just like you said.


540
00:32:06.148 --> 00:32:08.089
Unhook him.

541
00:32:09.574 --> 00:32:11.745
Where you going?

542
00:32:11.813 --> 00:32:13.537
I gave you
what you wanted, right?


543
00:32:13.606 --> 00:32:15.615
What do you want?

544
00:32:15.687 --> 00:32:17.728
I want a goddamn cheeseburger.

545
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.208
Tommy's or Fatburger?

546
00:32:19.273 --> 00:32:21.608
Fatburger,
double king with cheese.


547
00:32:21.674 --> 00:32:24.259
Sounds good.
Let's go. Get in.


548
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.152
He's tripping, huh?

549
00:32:26.218 --> 00:32:30.049
Shit, I'm getting
in the front seat this time.


550
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.291
So, you little sneak...

551
00:32:32.364 --> 00:32:34.853
you're smitten with
this broad with no last name...


552
00:32:34.924 --> 00:32:36.268
and you're
dumping stenographers.


553
00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:37.927
But I don't know
anything about her?


554
00:32:37.998 --> 00:32:39.525
Sometimes you're clueless.

555
00:32:39.598 --> 00:32:41.026
You'll make
a great Pogue someday.


556
00:32:41.103 --> 00:32:43.918
How about a fifth of scotch
over here?


557
00:32:43.983 --> 00:32:45.228
I admit it, Bobby.

558
00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:47.500
I get played now and then
because I'm trusting.


559
00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:49.544
I like giving people
the benefit of the doubt.


560
00:32:49.617 --> 00:32:51.308
When my trust is abused...

561
00:32:51.377 --> 00:32:52.905
it drives me
out of my fucking mind.


562
00:32:52.979 --> 00:32:56.427
Not as much as
she's driving me out of my mind.


563
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.059
She's black, Eldon.

564
00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:59.626
That's why
I don't talk about her.


565
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.042
You be dating a sister.

566
00:33:01.108 --> 00:33:02.286
I didn't know you were
an ebony and ivory man.


567
00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:05.172
I don't want to hear
a bunch of black jokes.


568
00:33:05.237 --> 00:33:06.579
Amigo,
you think I care about...


569
00:33:06.645 --> 00:33:09.199
the size, shape, color,
or political party...


570
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.732
of some sweet thing
you're rolling around with?


571
00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:12.564
While you're
thinking about pussy...


572
00:33:12.632 --> 00:33:14.356
I'm talking about Henry Kim...

573
00:33:14.424 --> 00:33:17.556
and his "struggling immigrant
from South Central" tap dance.


574
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:18.836
He's a gangster.

575
00:33:18.906 --> 00:33:20.400
Think it was a hit on his wife?

576
00:33:20.475 --> 00:33:21.555
It wasn't a hit.

577
00:33:21.626 --> 00:33:23.799
It would've been in and out,
a couple of vics.


578
00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.112
These guys lingered.

579
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.937
Back to robbery.

580
00:33:33.694 --> 00:33:36.956
I bet this place moves five
or six Gs of pussy weekdays...


581
00:33:37.023 --> 00:33:38.583
and double that on weekends.

582
00:33:38.656 --> 00:33:40.598
That's a lot of cash, Bobby.

583
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:44.952
Let's go fishing.

584
00:34:08.297 --> 00:34:10.053
What do you want?

585
00:34:10.121 --> 00:34:12.609
Half an hour ago,
I wanted this drink...


586
00:34:12.682 --> 00:34:14.505
now I want to fuck that girl.

587
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:17.538
Sorry, she can't do that.

588
00:34:17.612 --> 00:34:18.921
Find me one that can, slick.

589
00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:22.056
You got eight girls here.
You're not pimping them?


590
00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:23.336
I'm not talking to you.

591
00:34:23.407 --> 00:34:25.381
You're LAPD.
You beat Rodney King.


592
00:34:26.895 --> 00:34:28.837
I did not kick
Rodney King's ass...


593
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:31.563
but I'll have some serious fun
kicking your ass!


594
00:34:32.912 --> 00:34:36.688
Did you take Kim's money,
you son of a bitch?


595
00:34:36.753 --> 00:34:38.128
Talk to me!

596
00:34:38.194 --> 00:34:40.878
Did you put on a ski mask
and take his damn money?


597
00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:44.047
Get the fuck back inside!
Now!


598
00:34:44.116 --> 00:34:46.221
Did you kill his fucking wife?

599
00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:47.667
No, no, no!
I didn't do that!


600
00:34:47.731 --> 00:34:49.740
Get the fuck out of here now!

601
00:34:49.813 --> 00:34:51.668
Now! Move! Now!

602
00:34:51.734 --> 00:34:54.223
His family is like my family.
I didn't steal!


603
00:34:54.295 --> 00:34:55.669
I heard they got 200 grand.

604
00:34:55.736 --> 00:34:57.842
No, look, they took a safe.

605
00:34:57.912 --> 00:34:59.254
But it only has 1 50.

606
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.044
Anybody show up for work
late this morning?


607
00:35:01.112 --> 00:35:03.981
Anybody in your little
sewing circle blow town?


608
00:35:04.056 --> 00:35:05.301
Give me a fucking name!

609
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.949
Du Ku. He's not home.
I don't know where he is.


610
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.290
This guy doesn't own
one fucking chair?


611
00:35:45.254 --> 00:35:46.848
There's nothing in there.

612
00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.788
Holy...fuck.

613
00:36:06.861 --> 00:36:08.236
Oh, man.

614
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.780
I guess that's what they mean
by chilling out.


615
00:36:12.846 --> 00:36:15.881
-Shit.
-They tortured this guy.


616
00:36:15.952 --> 00:36:19.150
-He sang, man.
-He hit a high fucking "C."


617
00:36:19.217 --> 00:36:20.679
All right.

618
00:36:20.753 --> 00:36:27.017
Our bad guys have turned on to
Henry Kim's business somehow.


619
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.553
Snatched the bag man...

620
00:36:28.627 --> 00:36:30.601
tortured him to find out
where the money was hidden.


621
00:36:30.674 --> 00:36:33.545
They go in,
kill four people...


622
00:36:33.621 --> 00:36:35.147
come out, wing a fifth...

623
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.595
torch the getaway car...

624
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:38.188
and take off in
a second set of wheels.


625
00:36:38.261 --> 00:36:39.571
This thing's
coming together, Bobby.


626
00:36:39.638 --> 00:36:42.225
Let's call this in
and take another shot at Kim.


627
00:36:42.296 --> 00:36:43.987
Yeah, good.

628
00:36:46.138 --> 00:36:47.567
Morning, Matt.

629
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:48.983
Morning, Sergeant.

630
00:36:50.457 --> 00:36:51.571
Here.

631
00:36:54.074 --> 00:36:55.188
Thank you.

632
00:37:54.798 --> 00:37:57.547
The verdict might be today.

633
00:37:57.614 --> 00:38:00.963
I bet they get off.

634
00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:03.080
That's my opinion.
What about you?


635
00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:05.324
Jesus, you talk about
everything else...


636
00:38:05.392 --> 00:38:07.596
from dog racing
to foreign policy.


637
00:38:07.665 --> 00:38:09.608
How come you never talk
about the King thing?


638
00:38:09.682 --> 00:38:12.204
Bobby,
I avoid the subject...


639
00:38:12.274 --> 00:38:15.308
because it pains me
to see real criminals free...


640
00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.136
while four of my brothers
eat political shit...


641
00:38:17.204 --> 00:38:19.114
because the Pogues
outlawed the choke hold.


642
00:38:19.187 --> 00:38:22.353
When they got
rid of the choke hold...


643
00:38:22.421 --> 00:38:24.276
it left us with
a stun gun and a baton.


644
00:38:24.342 --> 00:38:25.487
The choke hold saved lives...

645
00:38:25.558 --> 00:38:26.965
but nobody ever got elected
saying that.


646
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:29.966
They don't give those guys
enough cars, radios...


647
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.732
equipment or live bodies
to man the watches.


648
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.710
Then they take away
the tactics that work...


649
00:38:33.785 --> 00:38:36.884
and indict them for using
approved tactics that don't?


650
00:38:36.953 --> 00:38:38.164
Bobby, this is simple.

651
00:38:38.234 --> 00:38:39.577
Either four good cops
are going down...


652
00:38:39.643 --> 00:38:41.137
because they followed
the department manual...


653
00:38:41.211 --> 00:38:44.059
or they get off and
we're back in the Summer of '65.


654
00:38:44.124 --> 00:38:47.223
I don't know about that.
You really think so?


655
00:38:49.951 --> 00:38:52.765
If they get off,
this city burns.


656
00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:57.083
Perry.

657
00:38:59.552 --> 00:39:01.146
I got it. Let's go.

658
00:39:01.218 --> 00:39:02.844
The wit's conscious.

659
00:39:02.913 --> 00:39:05.216
Freeway bags for these?

660
00:39:11.524 --> 00:39:12.768
How's he doing?

661
00:39:12.836 --> 00:39:15.520
In the last couple of hours,
he's moved around a bit.


662
00:39:15.588 --> 00:39:16.767
Good.

663
00:39:16.838 --> 00:39:18.562
Mr. Lewis, how you doing?

664
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.802
I'm Detective Keough.
This is Detective Perry.


665
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.207
Sir, we'd like to ask you
a couple questions.


666
00:39:23.272 --> 00:39:25.094
He's whacked out
on painkillers.


667
00:39:25.161 --> 00:39:28.030
He can't speak.
His larynx has been removed.


668
00:39:28.105 --> 00:39:29.698
The bullet shattered it.

669
00:39:29.769 --> 00:39:31.625
Sir, can you write?

670
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:35.138
Here.

671
00:39:35.211 --> 00:39:38.530
Mr. Lewis, could you identify
the race of the attackers?


672
00:39:43.823 --> 00:39:46.212
One was white,
and one was black.


673
00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.659
Hey, Jack.

674
00:39:47.728 --> 00:39:49.451
Hi, guys.

675
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.798
Brief me on Jack O'Hearts.

676
00:39:50.865 --> 00:39:52.175
I've been getting calls all day.

677
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:54.510
"My two best guys are on it,
giving 200%."


678
00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:57.099
Tell me you got the suspects
in your trunk.


679
00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.171
My trunk has nothing
but a spare tire and underwear.


680
00:40:00.243 --> 00:40:01.324
You gotta have some breaks.

681
00:40:01.396 --> 00:40:03.402
I interviewed the "K"
who owns the crime scene...


682
00:40:03.475 --> 00:40:06.291
who I sniffed out as a lesser
light of the underworld...


683
00:40:06.357 --> 00:40:07.567
and it turns out
he's got a strip club.


684
00:40:07.637 --> 00:40:10.005
He's pandering,
a cash-and-carry businessman...


685
00:40:10.071 --> 00:40:12.919
and he had a safe with
a buck-fifty in it.


686
00:40:12.983 --> 00:40:15.220
That's real money.
You guys found a body.


687
00:40:15.288 --> 00:40:18.071
-Kim's bag man.
-Your shooters are Korean.


688
00:40:18.137 --> 00:40:20.440
That's what we thought
till we interviewed the wit.


689
00:40:20.507 --> 00:40:22.645
He can't lD them.
They had ski masks.


690
00:40:22.714 --> 00:40:26.063
He can lD race.
It was a salt-and-pepper team.


691
00:40:26.139 --> 00:40:28.823
A safecracking spook
and a blue-eyed peckerwood.


692
00:40:28.892 --> 00:40:30.550
Who does that sound like?

693
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:34.167
How about
Orchard and Sidwell?


694
00:40:34.237 --> 00:40:36.475
Always Orchard
and Sidwell with you.


695
00:40:36.543 --> 00:40:37.852
What is that?

696
00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:39.894
You're not dumping
my two best informants.


697
00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:42.553
Jack, your pets,
your science projects--


698
00:40:42.622 --> 00:40:45.659
whatever the fuck they are--
the evil shits did this.


699
00:40:45.729 --> 00:40:47.901
It's time we put
these slick twists down.


700
00:40:47.969 --> 00:40:50.043
Your job is not to think.

701
00:40:51.363 --> 00:40:54.046
It is to follow orders,
to execute plans...


702
00:40:54.115 --> 00:40:55.774
and to be a good soldier.

703
00:40:55.844 --> 00:40:57.469
You're a goddamn
great soldier...


704
00:40:57.539 --> 00:40:59.001
because you leave
the planning and fixing to me.


705
00:40:59.076 --> 00:41:01.924
-Are you listening?
-I'm listening, Jack.


706
00:41:01.988 --> 00:41:04.128
Listen to my philosophy.
It's very simple.


707
00:41:04.198 --> 00:41:06.174
I am a performer
of unpleasant tasks...


708
00:41:06.247 --> 00:41:08.387
so that
the majority of people...


709
00:41:08.455 --> 00:41:10.049
are free
to perform pleasant ones.


710
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.260
The last thing I care about
is what you think.


711
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.540
I got it, Jack.

712
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:15.300
Good.
Open your fucking ears.


713
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.753
Orchard and Sidwell were
in San Diego working for me.


714
00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:20.834
You and Bobby will do
whatever it takes...


715
00:41:20.907 --> 00:41:22.020
to clear Jack O'Hearts.

716
00:41:22.092 --> 00:41:25.192
Find some bad guys
and get a search warrant!


717
00:41:25.261 --> 00:41:27.269
-You listening?
-I'm listening, Jack.


718
00:41:27.342 --> 00:41:28.586
You better be listening!

719
00:41:28.654 --> 00:41:30.957
I don't need you making shit up!

720
00:41:31.023 --> 00:41:33.991
Take the warrant and serve it
with Rico's platoon.


721
00:41:34.063 --> 00:41:35.918
Do what you do.

722
00:41:36.913 --> 00:41:38.888
OK?

723
00:41:38.962 --> 00:41:40.075
-OK?
-OK.


724
00:41:40.145 --> 00:41:41.258
Where are you going?

725
00:41:50.934 --> 00:41:54.064
OK. OK.

726
00:41:54.134 --> 00:41:56.523
It'll be a beautiful thing.

727
00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:59.349
Pull this off, you'll be
sitting on waterskis...


728
00:41:59.415 --> 00:42:00.844
sucking fumes
from my new boat...


729
00:42:00.919 --> 00:42:03.571
a couple of kegs and hookers
in Lake Havasu.


730
00:42:03.641 --> 00:42:05.234
Stick this
in Holland's mailbox...


731
00:42:05.306 --> 00:42:07.378
and get your asses
back on the street.


732
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:24.378
Forget finding the real guys?
Did I hear that right?


733
00:42:24.447 --> 00:42:25.690
Hey, Perry.

734
00:42:25.758 --> 00:42:27.220
You guys get anywhere with
that Jack O'Hearts case?


735
00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:30.775
We just had a breakthrough.
How are you guys doing?


736
00:42:30.847 --> 00:42:32.889
Just got a drive-by
murder-suicide--


737
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:35.417
a 12-year-old wasted
an ice cream truck driver.


738
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.630
Another normal day.

739
00:42:37.698 --> 00:42:39.161
Good luck
nailing those bastards.


740
00:42:39.235 --> 00:42:40.643
Keep us posted.

741
00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:52.195
Sit down, Bobby.

742
00:42:52.262 --> 00:42:53.888
We're going to find
a couple of assholes...


743
00:42:53.959 --> 00:42:55.650
and bury them
in the Jack O'Hearts.


744
00:42:55.719 --> 00:42:58.055
We cannot pin
four murders on patsies.


745
00:42:58.122 --> 00:42:59.266
No fucking way.

746
00:42:59.336 --> 00:43:02.566
The real shooters need to be
taken off the streets.


747
00:43:02.632 --> 00:43:05.285
I absolutely agree with you.

748
00:43:05.354 --> 00:43:06.761
They're vermin
and should be exterminated.


749
00:43:06.827 --> 00:43:08.932
But you got a crime
and you got criminals...


750
00:43:09.004 --> 00:43:11.557
and if you're meticulous,
somehow you make a match.


751
00:43:11.629 --> 00:43:13.451
We're in
the getting-shit-done business.


752
00:43:13.517 --> 00:43:15.657
What are you talking about?
You know who did it.


753
00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:17.254
Come on!

754
00:43:17.327 --> 00:43:19.662
How can Jack involve us
in this type of shit?


755
00:43:19.727 --> 00:43:23.209
-What the hell's he thinking?
-How fucking dare you!


756
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.577
Who the fuck are you
to question Jack Van Meter?


757
00:43:26.642 --> 00:43:29.162
You don't question his orders.
You follow them!


758
00:43:29.235 --> 00:43:30.926
I ought to kick your ass, man!

759
00:43:30.994 --> 00:43:32.075
You know jack, Bobby!

760
00:43:32.148 --> 00:43:34.515
You were tested and failed!

761
00:43:37.942 --> 00:43:39.404
That's my daddy's gun.

762
00:43:39.478 --> 00:43:41.845
You see those? Eleven men.

763
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:43.503
He and Jack were partners...

764
00:43:43.575 --> 00:43:45.430
and the only goddamn reason
this city's here...


765
00:43:45.496 --> 00:43:46.741
is because
they made it possible.


766
00:43:46.808 --> 00:43:48.370
They built it with bullets!

767
00:43:48.441 --> 00:43:50.546
Hunted down
evil fucking parasites...


768
00:43:50.617 --> 00:43:52.373
that would've committed
thousands of crimes...


769
00:43:52.441 --> 00:43:53.751
would've ruined
hundreds of lives.


770
00:43:53.818 --> 00:43:55.793
They protected
the good people, Bobby...


771
00:43:55.865 --> 00:43:57.874
so that they could grow
and not the cancer!


772
00:43:57.946 --> 00:43:59.955
Who the fuck are you
to question anybody?


773
00:44:00.027 --> 00:44:01.817
Eldon, please. Take it easy!

774
00:44:03.389 --> 00:44:05.976
Come on, take it easy.
I'm with you.


775
00:44:06.046 --> 00:44:08.349
-Good.
-We're going to do this.


776
00:44:08.414 --> 00:44:09.909
OK?

777
00:44:16.992 --> 00:44:19.415
How do we get
a search warrant?


778
00:44:27.108 --> 00:44:28.668
Sergeant Perry?

779
00:44:28.741 --> 00:44:30.399
I'm from the paper.
You got a minute?


780
00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:31.678
No.

781
00:44:31.749 --> 00:44:34.138
I heard SlS is attached to
the Jack O'Hearts killings.


782
00:44:34.214 --> 00:44:35.424
That's a little overkill,
don't you think?


783
00:44:35.494 --> 00:44:38.049
Is there some
political motivation here?


784
00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:41.120
I know you've said you've been
misquoted in the past.


785
00:44:41.192 --> 00:44:42.981
That's why
I brought a tape recorder.


786
00:44:43.049 --> 00:44:45.286
You give me a quote,
and I'll run it...


787
00:44:45.354 --> 00:44:47.360
exactly as you say it--
word for word.


788
00:44:50.506 --> 00:44:52.449
The question is this--

789
00:44:52.522 --> 00:44:55.622
Why has an elite force like SlS
been asked to solve...


790
00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:59.042
a routine multiple robbery
homicide in South Central?


791
00:44:59.117 --> 00:45:02.053
Unless there's something
that we don't know about.


792
00:45:02.126 --> 00:45:04.331
Quote--

793
00:45:04.399 --> 00:45:06.788
Get your fucking head
out of my ass...


794
00:45:06.863 --> 00:45:08.903
and stop writing that
cocksucking criminals...


795
00:45:08.975 --> 00:45:10.951
are victims,
instead of the pigs they are...


796
00:45:11.025 --> 00:45:14.604
and let motherfucking cops do
what motherfucking cops do.


797
00:45:14.674 --> 00:45:16.780
End quote. Print that.

798
00:45:22.803 --> 00:45:23.918
Hey, Deena.

799
00:45:25.108 --> 00:45:26.451
Sergeant.

800
00:45:26.516 --> 00:45:28.852
How you doing?
I'm Detective Keough.


801
00:45:28.919 --> 00:45:30.446
Hi. Good to meet you.

802
00:45:31.896 --> 00:45:34.067
What brings SlS to my office?

803
00:45:34.137 --> 00:45:35.763
The quadruple on Jefferson...

804
00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:37.743
and a linked mayhem homicide
in Koreatown.


805
00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:40.186
-Dead dispatcher.
-That yours?


806
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.772
We're helping out South Bureau.
You know Peltz and Sapin?


807
00:45:42.842 --> 00:45:45.047
The Bourbon Brothers?
Good Homicide guys.


808
00:45:45.116 --> 00:45:47.866
We're taking point
because they're overloaded.


809
00:45:47.933 --> 00:45:49.526
We found the gentlemen
that did it.


810
00:45:49.596 --> 00:45:51.058
We need a search warrant.

811
00:45:51.132 --> 00:45:53.206
Better have more than
on that Hollywood Hills double.


812
00:45:53.278 --> 00:45:54.772
I got hell from the judge
on that one.


813
00:45:54.846 --> 00:45:56.504
You could finish the story.

814
00:45:56.575 --> 00:45:58.964
His Honor signed,
and I nailed the bastard.


815
00:45:59.039 --> 00:46:02.456
You got lucky.
Let's see what you got.


816
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:12.955
It's a little thin,
but these are some bad hombres.


817
00:46:13.028 --> 00:46:17.186
This guy sodomized an

818
00:46:17.254 --> 00:46:19.357
This one raped a little girl
in front of her family...


819
00:46:19.429 --> 00:46:22.562
during a home invasion.
Read the file.


820
00:46:27.528 --> 00:46:30.343
Calling these circumstantial
would be a compliment.


821
00:46:30.409 --> 00:46:33.475
I can't issue on this.
No judge will sign it.


822
00:46:33.544 --> 00:46:35.400
We're not going to trial,
for Christ's sake.


823
00:46:35.465 --> 00:46:37.921
It's a search warrant.
There's probable cause.


824
00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:40.843
Don't bullshit me.
I can't process this.


825
00:46:43.597 --> 00:46:46.413
You can process it...
and you will.


826
00:46:46.477 --> 00:46:48.201
And by tomorrow morning...

827
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.026
those two young bucks
will be dressed out...


828
00:46:50.095 --> 00:46:51.850
and strapped across
the hood of my Chevy.


829
00:46:51.919 --> 00:46:55.083
So says the playbook, Deena,
so do it.


830
00:46:55.151 --> 00:46:57.225
Be a team player.

831
00:46:58.545 --> 00:47:00.400
Jesus Christ,
you got Alzheimer's?


832
00:47:00.466 --> 00:47:02.442
You know the deal.

833
00:47:02.514 --> 00:47:04.041
You want to change it?

834
00:47:04.114 --> 00:47:05.675
Give me your phone.

835
00:47:05.747 --> 00:47:08.978
-Do you have any shame?
-I try not to.


836
00:47:10.932 --> 00:47:13.967
I'll issue the search warrant,
but no judge will sign it.


837
00:47:14.038 --> 00:47:15.697
The judge is my problem.

838
00:47:17.688 --> 00:47:20.022
We'll wait, Deena.

839
00:47:22.137 --> 00:47:23.698
Fine.

840
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.396
I'm lost.
What just happened?


841
00:47:25.466 --> 00:47:26.992
Deena went to USC.

842
00:47:27.065 --> 00:47:29.521
Good sorority, Dean's list,
the whole thing.


843
00:47:29.594 --> 00:47:32.017
She's a sharp gal,
but like a lot of young girls...


844
00:47:32.092 --> 00:47:33.719
away from home
for the first time...


845
00:47:33.789 --> 00:47:36.276
she experimented
and got into team sports.


846
00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.587
The whole football team, man.

847
00:47:38.654 --> 00:47:40.510
Fight on for old S.C.!

848
00:47:40.575 --> 00:47:43.161
It was a hell of a videotape.
I never saw it.


849
00:47:43.232 --> 00:47:46.809
She married some CEO from
Century City who doesn't know...


850
00:47:46.879 --> 00:47:48.636
and that's the way
she wants to keep it.


851
00:47:48.704 --> 00:47:50.493
And that's the deal.

852
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:52.219
There's always a deal.

853
00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:57.080
Judge Russo, I'm sorry.

854
00:47:57.155 --> 00:47:58.945
I really appreciate this, sir.

855
00:47:59.011 --> 00:48:00.419
You're sure about this one?

856
00:48:00.484 --> 00:48:02.143
These guys are a couple
of sick puppies, Your Honor.


857
00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:04.035
It's all here
if you want to read it.


858
00:48:04.101 --> 00:48:05.989
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.


859
00:48:06.053 --> 00:48:07.963
As the affiant,
do you swear that everything...


860
00:48:08.039 --> 00:48:09.446
contained in
this affidavit is true...


861
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:10.656
to the best
of your knowledge...


862
00:48:10.727 --> 00:48:12.353
-So help you God?
-I do.


863
00:48:13.768 --> 00:48:15.428
-How's Sally?
-She's great.


864
00:48:15.497 --> 00:48:16.958
Mrs. Russo feeling better?

865
00:48:17.033 --> 00:48:18.277
Much better, thank you.

866
00:48:18.346 --> 00:48:19.590
This is Bobby Keough,
my new partner.


867
00:48:19.658 --> 00:48:21.414
-Judge Russo.
-Hi.


868
00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:23.271
Great.
Thank you very much, sir.


869
00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:24.451
Appreciate it.

870
00:48:35.983 --> 00:48:38.634
Sign out a car and paint
"Enola Gay" on the side...


871
00:48:38.703 --> 00:48:40.591
because we're gonna drop
the bomb on Holland.


872
00:48:40.656 --> 00:48:41.900
Take a look at these.

873
00:48:49.779 --> 00:48:51.274
Who's the female?

874
00:48:51.347 --> 00:48:53.901
Beth Williamson--
LAPD Sergeant.


875
00:48:53.972 --> 00:48:55.085
She's Holland's assistant.

876
00:48:55.156 --> 00:48:57.359
Who took them?

877
00:48:57.427 --> 00:48:58.541
Me.

878
00:49:01.334 --> 00:49:04.302
Some people
call that "doggy-style."


879
00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:06.994
I like "Bow wow wow."

880
00:49:07.064 --> 00:49:09.106
Call this one "Girl on top."

881
00:49:09.178 --> 00:49:11.796
Wait. Who's wearing
the high heels here?


882
00:49:11.866 --> 00:49:15.827
And let's see. Oh, yeah.
Missionary.


883
00:49:15.899 --> 00:49:19.544
Although I am not quite sure
what religion that would be.


884
00:49:19.612 --> 00:49:21.401
What do you want me
to do with these?


885
00:49:21.469 --> 00:49:22.647
Stick them
in Holland's mailbox.


886
00:49:22.717 --> 00:49:25.402
Then you're off till 2100.
Get some sack time.


887
00:49:25.471 --> 00:49:26.878
You look like shit, Bobby.

888
00:49:26.943 --> 00:49:28.601
I'll see you.

889
00:50:07.434 --> 00:50:10.435
What's up
with the blue suit?


890
00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:13.225
Public relations.

891
00:50:13.293 --> 00:50:14.753
So people see
everyone who wears it...


892
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:17.251
isn't like you, Detective.

893
00:50:17.325 --> 00:50:19.214
Would you like a menu?

894
00:50:23.504 --> 00:50:25.413
Why don't you tell Holland
he's a great pimp?


895
00:50:25.487 --> 00:50:27.594
What the hell
are you talking about?


896
00:50:28.816 --> 00:50:32.266
I think I was falling for you.

897
00:50:32.339 --> 00:50:33.899
Yeah, I really do.

898
00:50:36.724 --> 00:50:39.180
Do you deny
you're sleeping with him?


899
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:49.233
The secret files. The gossip.

900
00:50:49.302 --> 00:50:50.928
The dirty little stories
whispered...


901
00:50:50.998 --> 00:50:54.513
in the men's rooms
and hallways of Parker Center.


902
00:50:54.583 --> 00:50:57.880
-You're a part of that?
-I know what happened.


903
00:50:59.834 --> 00:51:02.224
He was my station house fling.

904
00:51:02.298 --> 00:51:05.682
I was a patrol supervisor,
and I was attracted to him.


905
00:51:05.756 --> 00:51:07.479
I thought he was a great man.

906
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:09.404
It was a brief affair.

907
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.893
Then he told me
he wasn't leaving his wife.


908
00:51:11.966 --> 00:51:13.560
That was five years ago.

909
00:51:13.632 --> 00:51:17.941
We walked away like adults.

910
00:51:18.016 --> 00:51:21.563
It's long over, and it is
my business, his business...


911
00:51:21.633 --> 00:51:24.896
and not yours or anyone else's.

912
00:51:24.961 --> 00:51:27.898
Yeah, it is my business.

913
00:51:27.971 --> 00:51:30.012
It is my business
when you're spying on me.


914
00:51:30.083 --> 00:51:32.322
You're the goddamn spy.

915
00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:35.585
You work for Van Meter, not me.

916
00:51:35.653 --> 00:51:37.542
Who approached who first?

917
00:51:37.606 --> 00:51:41.503
I never wanted to know
anything about your work.


918
00:51:41.576 --> 00:51:43.332
I never asked.

919
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.940
Now...
I know more than I want to.


920
00:51:48.009 --> 00:51:49.765
What do you know?

921
00:52:06.447 --> 00:52:07.725
Chill, man.

922
00:52:36.888 --> 00:52:39.092
Honey, we're running late.

923
00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:53.177
I want out
of the marriage, Arthur.


924
00:52:54.972 --> 00:52:56.183
Listen.

925
00:52:56.253 --> 00:52:57.814
Please, just listen.

926
00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:01.564
I'm glad the time
you put into the department...


927
00:53:01.632 --> 00:53:03.322
is paying off for you.

928
00:53:03.391 --> 00:53:06.524
But the time I put into you
isn't paying off for me.


929
00:53:06.592 --> 00:53:09.791
I want to have a life
while I still can.


930
00:53:09.857 --> 00:53:13.088
Don't worry.
I'm still down for you, baby.


931
00:53:13.155 --> 00:53:14.562
I think you'll make
a wonderful Chief...


932
00:53:14.628 --> 00:53:18.623
and I'll do my part
to help you make it.


933
00:53:18.692 --> 00:53:22.338
And when you do...

934
00:53:22.405 --> 00:53:25.090
I don't see myself
staying around.


935
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:53.003
I'm sorry.

936
00:53:54.095 --> 00:53:55.852
That happened five years ago.

937
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:58.157
You know it.
We dealt with it.


938
00:53:58.224 --> 00:54:00.745
You said you would forgive me
and try to forget.


939
00:54:00.817 --> 00:54:02.793
It's hard to forget when
you got a mailbox full of those.


940
00:54:02.865 --> 00:54:05.322
I didn't know
about those pictures.


941
00:54:06.515 --> 00:54:09.004
LAPD doesn't miss a trick,
does it?


942
00:54:09.076 --> 00:54:12.689
Is it possible to have a secret
inside that department?


943
00:54:12.757 --> 00:54:14.644
No.

944
00:54:20.118 --> 00:54:21.875
Perry, you know the Xs and Os.

945
00:54:21.943 --> 00:54:24.563
You'll be in the observation
post in the alley.


946
00:54:24.632 --> 00:54:27.120
You guys are lucky the verdicts
didn't come in today...


947
00:54:27.193 --> 00:54:28.820
or we'd be in
the south end on standby.


948
00:54:28.889 --> 00:54:31.542
It took my guys a day
to locate these assholes...


949
00:54:31.611 --> 00:54:33.072
and two more days
to pat them down.


950
00:54:33.146 --> 00:54:34.969
We finally tailed them
into Charcoal Alley.


951
00:54:35.036 --> 00:54:37.141
You know Bobby Keough,
my number two on this one.


952
00:54:37.213 --> 00:54:39.155
-How you doing?
-Yeah, I know Bobby.


953
00:54:39.229 --> 00:54:40.570
Congratulations
on the shooting board.


954
00:54:40.636 --> 00:54:43.420
You ever get tired of SlS,
come down to Metro.


955
00:54:43.484 --> 00:54:44.631
We could always use a good man.

956
00:54:44.702 --> 00:54:46.360
That's not gonna happen,
but thanks.


957
00:54:46.431 --> 00:54:49.017
What do you say
we hit the bricks?


958
00:54:49.088 --> 00:54:51.771
What's going on, man?
This ain't your style.


959
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.367
Political as it gets, Rico.

960
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.296
They want this one
on the front page...


961
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.987
so make as much noise
as you want.


962
00:54:57.058 --> 00:55:02.111
I'd like to introduce
a member of our congregation...


963
00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.477
who has spoken to us
on many occasions...


964
00:55:05.541 --> 00:55:09.633
Assistant Los Angeles
Police Chief Arthur Holland.


965
00:55:15.624 --> 00:55:18.276
Praise the Lord!

966
00:55:19.754 --> 00:55:22.121
Ladies, listen up.

967
00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:24.194
Perry and Keough will give you
some background on the players.


968
00:55:24.267 --> 00:55:26.406
These are the two shitbirds
that took out...


969
00:55:26.475 --> 00:55:29.029
one of our dispatchers
and a few other innocents.


970
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.562
No one fucks with our family.

971
00:55:30.638 --> 00:55:33.354
And remember--
SlS doesn't have a jail...


972
00:55:33.421 --> 00:55:34.981
so if you knock
one of these pricks down...


973
00:55:35.054 --> 00:55:36.581
make sure he stays down.

974
00:55:36.654 --> 00:55:38.794
I remember
one fine spring day...


975
00:55:38.863 --> 00:55:42.246
about 25 years ago.

976
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.385
I had just graduated
from the Police Academy.


977
00:55:45.455 --> 00:55:49.997
I felt so proud
with my brand new blues...


978
00:55:50.066 --> 00:55:52.488
coming to church that Sunday.

979
00:55:52.563 --> 00:55:56.426
I felt so proud with
my new badge on my chest.


980
00:55:56.501 --> 00:55:58.443
Bottom line, gentlemen,
watch your asses...


981
00:55:58.517 --> 00:56:00.339
and pay attention
to your fields of fire.


982
00:56:00.406 --> 00:56:01.835
Once we have secured
the location...


983
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:04.179
we turn it over
to Perry and his people.


984
00:56:04.247 --> 00:56:05.524
Sergeant, take over.

985
00:56:05.591 --> 00:56:06.998
A couple of weeks ago...

986
00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:09.300
some gentlemen
from Cleveland called me.


987
00:56:09.367 --> 00:56:11.888
They wanted me
to move out to Ohio...


988
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.436
to become the Chief
of their police department.


989
00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:20.980
That opportunity
is knocking mighty loud...


990
00:56:21.051 --> 00:56:25.723
and my LAPD badge
doesn't seem to glow anymore...


991
00:56:25.788 --> 00:56:30.941
and I'm not as proud of my blues
as I used to be.


992
00:56:31.007 --> 00:56:34.936
Today, I called those gentlemen
in Cleveland...


993
00:56:35.008 --> 00:56:37.113
and I told them I'm staying put.

994
00:56:40.032 --> 00:56:41.374
Questions?

995
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:43.547
We'll be pulling out
in 15 minutes.


996
00:56:48.452 --> 00:56:51.486
I stand before you tonight...

997
00:56:51.556 --> 00:56:54.873
to declare
my goal of becoming...


998
00:56:54.948 --> 00:57:00.001
the first African-American
Police Chief of Los Angeles.


999
00:57:19.277 --> 00:57:21.252
What happens if
they take these guys alive?


1000
00:57:21.326 --> 00:57:23.300
Getting out alive
isn't part of the drill.


1001
00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:24.552
No, I know.

1002
00:57:24.623 --> 00:57:26.533
For all I know, you'll hand
these dicks your Roscoe...


1003
00:57:26.608 --> 00:57:28.266
and they'll shove it
up your ass.


1004
00:57:28.337 --> 00:57:30.475
Shut the fuck up about that.
I'm serious.


1005
00:57:30.545 --> 00:57:32.367
Shut the fuck up about it.

1006
00:57:32.433 --> 00:57:34.474
-Hate me right now?
-You're damn right!


1007
00:57:34.547 --> 00:57:36.489
Good. Stay in that zone.

1008
00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:43.882
-What are you doing?
-Calling the suspects.


1009
00:57:43.956 --> 00:57:45.103
Why?

1010
00:57:45.174 --> 00:57:47.791
Making sure they're up.
You can't shoot a man in bed.


1011
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.545
Hey, dumb ass,
take a look out your window.


1012
00:57:50.614 --> 00:57:53.398
The cops are crawling
all over your place.


1013
00:57:53.463 --> 00:57:54.806
Flash bang!

1014
00:58:27.266 --> 00:58:29.885
On the ground now!
Get the fuck down!


1015
00:58:29.955 --> 00:58:32.443
-All right!
-Get your fucking hands up!


1016
00:58:32.515 --> 00:58:34.403
All right! I'm cool.

1017
00:58:34.468 --> 00:58:36.640
Get the fuck down! Now!

1018
00:58:36.709 --> 00:58:38.913
Take my piece.
There you go. Here.


1019
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.443
There you go. Safety's off.

1020
00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:42.907
You drill him,
I'll take the heat.


1021
00:58:45.254 --> 00:58:46.848
Who's that?

1022
00:58:46.918 --> 00:58:49.157
All right Hey!

1023
00:58:49.223 --> 00:58:51.134
Take this worthless
piece of shit down right now!


1024
00:58:51.209 --> 00:58:52.518
I never did shit to you.

1025
00:58:52.586 --> 00:58:53.730
-Shut up!
-Be cool.


1026
00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:55.875
-Shut the fuck up!
-I ain't got no gun.


1027
00:58:55.946 --> 00:58:58.596
Go to work, Bobby!
We're running out of time.


1028
00:58:58.666 --> 00:59:00.969
Man, go to work!
We're running out of time here!


1029
00:59:01.036 --> 00:59:04.419
-I ain't got a gun.
-What?


1030
00:59:04.492 --> 00:59:06.348
Yeah, you do, cocksucker!
How about that?


1031
00:59:06.413 --> 00:59:08.849
-Come on, Bobby.
-Don't, don't, don't.


1032
00:59:08.899 --> 00:59:11.320
We're not going back to Jack
empty-handed.


1033
00:59:11.394 --> 00:59:14.524
You want me to do this, Bobby?

1034
00:59:14.594 --> 00:59:16.731
Shit.
You want me to do this?


1035
00:59:16.801 --> 00:59:18.459
I will do this.

1036
00:59:18.528 --> 00:59:20.918
You want me to do this?

1037
00:59:20.992 --> 00:59:23.030
Look, don't.

1038
00:59:26.785 --> 00:59:30.460
You got to do it, Bobby.
No choice, man.


1039
00:59:30.528 --> 00:59:34.488
Take this worthless
piece of shit down right now.


1040
00:59:35.581 --> 00:59:37.654
For Christ's sake,
we're running out of time.


1041
00:59:37.726 --> 00:59:40.213
When that light goes out,
you do it!


1042
00:59:41.598 --> 00:59:43.770
Do it, Bobby!

1043
00:59:57.243 --> 00:59:58.672
Bobby, breathe.

1044
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:08.371
Bobby, come on.
Take a deep breath.


1045
01:00:08.443 --> 01:00:11.889
Stay down there.
Breathe. Hang on.


1046
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.848
You'll be all right.
Give me your gun.


1047
01:00:13.915 --> 01:00:16.249
That's it.
Come on, breathe deep.


1048
01:00:21.177 --> 01:00:22.638
It's over, man.

1049
01:00:22.711 --> 01:00:24.884
So, who shot him?

1050
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:27.187
-You get him, Eldon?
-Yeah.


1051
01:00:27.255 --> 01:00:29.327
How many is that now?

1052
01:00:29.399 --> 01:00:31.375
Who the fuck cares?
What about the other guy?


1053
01:00:31.449 --> 01:00:34.611
He pulled a shotgun on us.
My guys dropped him.


1054
01:00:34.679 --> 01:00:37.132
Good.
Let's get the logs rolling.


1055
01:00:37.207 --> 01:00:38.583
Hey, Rico...

1056
01:00:38.647 --> 01:00:41.013
no statements till
Robbery-Homicide gets here?


1057
01:00:41.078 --> 01:00:42.931
Don't worry about it.
I'm all over it.


1058
01:00:48.502 --> 01:00:49.747
Bobby, you listen to me.

1059
01:00:49.814 --> 01:00:51.537
This asshole had it coming.

1060
01:00:51.605 --> 01:00:53.710
All the fuck he ever did
was ruin lives.


1061
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.634
You saved somebody
a shitload of misery...


1062
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.075
so get it together.

1063
01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.660
You didn't shoot this guy,
I did.


1064
01:01:23.855 --> 01:01:25.831
I was giving the suspect
commands...


1065
01:01:25.906 --> 01:01:27.017
and he wouldn't comply.

1066
01:01:27.087 --> 01:01:28.462
Which commands?

1067
01:01:29.488 --> 01:01:32.619
"Police officer. Freeze.

1068
01:01:32.687 --> 01:01:34.956
"Let me see your hands.
On your knees."


1069
01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:36.931
OK.

1070
01:01:37.007 --> 01:01:39.342
Andthen I...

1071
01:01:39.408 --> 01:01:41.796
I saw the suspect
reach into his waistband...


1072
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:45.218
and I saw a metallic object
in his hands.


1073
01:01:45.294 --> 01:01:47.049
I fired
my service weapon once...


1074
01:01:47.117 --> 01:01:49.386
striking the suspect
in the chest.


1075
01:01:52.462 --> 01:01:55.397
I thought Sergeant Perry
fired his service weapon once.


1076
01:01:57.356 --> 01:01:59.559
Yeah, right.

1077
01:01:59.627 --> 01:02:01.090
That's right. I'm sorry.

1078
01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:04.776
No problemo, amigo.
We got all day.


1079
01:02:04.843 --> 01:02:06.437
We'll get it right.

1080
01:02:06.508 --> 01:02:09.670
Let's go over
that last part again.


1081
01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:20.228
I saw the suspect
reach into his waistband...


1082
01:02:20.298 --> 01:02:23.779
and I saw a metallic object
in his hands.


1083
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:26.720
Then my partner fired
his service weapon once...


1084
01:02:26.795 --> 01:02:28.832
striking the suspect
in the chest.


1085
01:02:30.281 --> 01:02:32.133
Perfect.

1086
01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.809
We're all done.
Twice through is plenty.


1087
01:02:35.879 --> 01:02:37.309
Right.

1088
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:46.333
Bobby was a natural, Jack.

1089
01:02:46.405 --> 01:02:49.024
When the shit went down,
he did it right.


1090
01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:56.325
Think you could do it again?

1091
01:02:58.405 --> 01:03:01.438
-He's a natural.
-He's my blood.


1092
01:03:05.954 --> 01:03:08.605
-Done with the OlS guys?
-Yeah.


1093
01:03:08.675 --> 01:03:10.846
They were trying to get a job
with our unit.


1094
01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:15.455
You boys are heroes.

1095
01:03:15.524 --> 01:03:18.011
I like heroes.
A simple idea, really.


1096
01:03:18.081 --> 01:03:19.772
You got
your villain and your hero.


1097
01:03:19.842 --> 01:03:21.334
Modern thinking
tries to complicate it...


1098
01:03:21.409 --> 01:03:23.797
but it always
comes down to that.


1099
01:03:23.872 --> 01:03:26.077
Those who victimize
were once victims...


1100
01:03:26.147 --> 01:03:27.672
all that stuff
they teach in college.


1101
01:03:27.747 --> 01:03:30.298
It's sad.
It's probably even true.


1102
01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:32.255
It really doesn't matter.

1103
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.294
Everybody's got a sad story.

1104
01:03:34.368 --> 01:03:36.605
Who gives a shit?

1105
01:03:36.671 --> 01:03:39.354
You guys take a look
at those pictures?


1106
01:03:44.095 --> 01:03:47.707
I thought they'd put Holland's
ass down, but he's still up.


1107
01:03:47.776 --> 01:03:50.644
He's on the goddamn news
saying he wants to be Chief.


1108
01:03:50.719 --> 01:03:52.857
I got plenty more shit.
I can wait.


1109
01:03:52.927 --> 01:03:55.347
Will he press us
on the Robertson shooting?


1110
01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.876
Could he know
what really happened?


1111
01:03:57.950 --> 01:04:00.699
He is pressing.
He might have a witness.


1112
01:04:00.764 --> 01:04:03.285
What?
There's no fucking witness.


1113
01:04:03.357 --> 01:04:06.259
He might dig up someone
in the D.A.'s office...


1114
01:04:06.332 --> 01:04:08.219
happy to file on you two
for murder and conspiracy.


1115
01:04:08.285 --> 01:04:10.291
Bullshit, Jack.
Nobody saw shit.


1116
01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:13.296
I'm holding it together, Eldon.
That's what I do.


1117
01:04:13.372 --> 01:04:14.650
Whatever. Nobody saw shit.

1118
01:04:14.715 --> 01:04:17.432
There's no witness.
Nobody saw shit.


1119
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.387
You said
that three times already.


1120
01:04:23.962 --> 01:04:25.522
Are you feeling OK?

1121
01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:30.834
Yeah, I'm fine.

1122
01:04:30.906 --> 01:04:33.458
There's that
Orchard and Sidwell thing...


1123
01:04:33.528 --> 01:04:35.472
but whatever.

1124
01:04:35.545 --> 01:04:37.333
We're not going there.

1125
01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:40.814
Get some rest.

1126
01:04:40.888 --> 01:04:43.406
You're going to need it.

1127
01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:45.617
Promotion party tomorrow.

1128
01:04:45.685 --> 01:04:47.215
Can't wait to hear your speech.

1129
01:04:47.289 --> 01:04:49.393
No, really.

1130
01:04:49.462 --> 01:04:51.251
The press will be there.
Let's give them a show.


1131
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.580
Yeah, I'll be there.
On time.


1132
01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:02.420
-You guys were good today.
-Yeah.


1133
01:05:02.487 --> 01:05:04.907
-You OK?
-Yeah, fine.


1134
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:08.524
Don't worry about Holland.
It's my problem.


1135
01:05:08.597 --> 01:05:10.352
Get the fuck out of here.

1136
01:05:37.456 --> 01:05:40.903
What the fuck
are we going to do, Bobby?


1137
01:05:40.976 --> 01:05:43.463
It's a hell of a job, isn't it?

1138
01:05:47.662 --> 01:05:48.775
Why don't you come over
to the house?


1139
01:05:48.846 --> 01:05:51.117
Sally will fix up
a big pot of goulash.


1140
01:05:51.184 --> 01:05:53.900
No, I'm beat.
I'm going home to sleep.


1141
01:05:53.966 --> 01:05:56.519
You'll be OK, Bobby.

1142
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:58.794
Little gangster kids
out there killing people...


1143
01:05:58.863 --> 01:06:00.355
you don't see them sweating it.

1144
01:06:00.429 --> 01:06:04.072
Will you shut up, Eldon?

1145
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.028
I had a facer once.

1146
01:06:08.429 --> 01:06:10.665
Just like that.

1147
01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:12.904
The guy was begging me
for his life.


1148
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:18.818
I found out later that
he had a wife and a little boy.


1149
01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:22.339
Every Christmas, I slipped
some money into her mailbox.


1150
01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:26.182
That one really fucked me up.

1151
01:06:27.403 --> 01:06:30.151
I can still see his face.

1152
01:06:33.705 --> 01:06:35.428
Come on, man.

1153
01:06:35.498 --> 01:06:38.181
Come on over.
You'll make her day.


1154
01:07:46.434 --> 01:07:47.514
What?

1155
01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:49.757
What do you think?

1156
01:07:49.824 --> 01:07:55.867
Sal, put the box down.
This is not going to happen.


1157
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.928
What is this?

1158
01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:06.137
I didn't think
you'd be home till late.


1159
01:08:06.206 --> 01:08:08.790
I didn't want to see you
like this.


1160
01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:15.127
Read it.

1161
01:08:18.044 --> 01:08:19.768
Eldon, don't do this.

1162
01:08:19.836 --> 01:08:22.770
You wrote it,
but you can't read it?


1163
01:08:24.795 --> 01:08:26.225
Read it.

1164
01:08:36.953 --> 01:08:38.863
"Dear Eldon...

1165
01:08:38.937 --> 01:08:41.654
"you're probably wondering
what's going on.


1166
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.232
"Well, it's finally over.

1167
01:08:45.305 --> 01:08:46.648
"l found a place.

1168
01:08:46.713 --> 01:08:48.240
"I'm taking our son with me.

1169
01:08:48.314 --> 01:08:49.688
"This is a good thing.

1170
01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:52.209
"He's frightened of you,
like I used to be.


1171
01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.613
"l know you can handle
our leaving...


1172
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.955
"because you really don't
give a shit about us."


1173
01:08:56.024 --> 01:08:57.201
Honey, that is not--

1174
01:08:57.271 --> 01:09:00.619
"You care more about
the people you hate.


1175
01:09:00.695 --> 01:09:03.696
"l guess you're still trying
to be your father."


1176
01:09:03.768 --> 01:09:04.880
What?

1177
01:09:04.951 --> 01:09:08.299
"You'll find out anyway,
so I'm telling you now.


1178
01:09:08.376 --> 01:09:11.722
"l met a man at the jail.

1179
01:09:11.796 --> 01:09:13.771
"But don't start beating up
every deputy you see...


1180
01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:15.404
"because he's not a cop...

1181
01:09:15.476 --> 01:09:18.641
and he's not an inmate, either."

1182
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:21.263
"He's a lawyer."

1183
01:09:21.334 --> 01:09:24.333
-"A defense lawyer."
-Oh, that's good.


1184
01:09:26.484 --> 01:09:29.199
A fucking defense lawyer.
That's just...


1185
01:09:29.266 --> 01:09:32.136
Sal, come on, man.
This is...


1186
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:36.042
Fuck it, man. Whatever.

1187
01:09:36.116 --> 01:09:37.675
Get back in here!

1188
01:09:37.746 --> 01:09:39.241
You wanted me to read it...

1189
01:09:39.315 --> 01:09:41.167
you're going
to listen to me read it!


1190
01:09:47.632 --> 01:09:50.929
"We're going to try and
start a new life together.


1191
01:09:50.993 --> 01:09:55.400
"And I say try
because I have no idea...


1192
01:09:55.472 --> 01:09:58.439
"what a healthy relationship
looks like."


1193
01:10:00.366 --> 01:10:04.195
"l know this seems abrupt...

1194
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:07.849
"unless you're good
at reading signals...


1195
01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.057
"which you're not."

1196
01:10:14.317 --> 01:10:16.869
"l have watched you
descend into Hell...


1197
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:20.835
"and I have been waiting
for you to come back.


1198
01:10:20.909 --> 01:10:23.757
"Apparently,
you don't want to."


1199
01:10:29.004 --> 01:10:31.525
"l loved you."

1200
01:10:34.667 --> 01:10:36.040
"Good-bye."

1201
01:10:45.002 --> 01:10:48.995
Sal, put the box down.

1202
01:10:49.064 --> 01:10:52.413
The house is yours.

1203
01:10:52.488 --> 01:10:54.693
You don't have to leave.
I'll do that.


1204
01:10:59.272 --> 01:11:01.508
Hey, guys. Just...

1205
01:11:01.577 --> 01:11:03.518
You can unpack
everything in the truck...


1206
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:05.729
and bring it back in.
I'm sorry.


1207
01:11:11.111 --> 01:11:13.349
I don't know what to say, Sal.

1208
01:11:15.718 --> 01:11:17.474
I don't know what to say.

1209
01:11:24.965 --> 01:11:26.525
Say good-bye.

1210
01:11:36.996 --> 01:11:38.751
Good-bye.

1211
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:40.498
All right.

1212
01:12:44.186 --> 01:12:45.396
Please go away.

1213
01:12:45.466 --> 01:12:48.664
I got to speak to you.
I'm not moving until we talk!


1214
01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:57.650
-You're a thug, Bobby.
-I know.


1215
01:12:57.722 --> 01:12:58.833
What do you want?

1216
01:12:58.904 --> 01:13:01.009
I can't eat, I can't sleep,
I can't think.


1217
01:13:01.079 --> 01:13:02.258
Tell me what you want.

1218
01:13:02.328 --> 01:13:04.303
I killed a man last night!

1219
01:13:04.376 --> 01:13:06.613
I blew a hole
through his chest!


1220
01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:10.028
Every time I close my eyes,
I see him staring at me.


1221
01:13:10.103 --> 01:13:12.339
-You're making no sense.
-The Jack O'Hearts case.


1222
01:13:12.407 --> 01:13:13.933
Me and Perry
cleared it last night.


1223
01:13:14.007 --> 01:13:15.314
Two suspects are dead.
They're the wrong guys.


1224
01:13:15.382 --> 01:13:18.700
No, wait. Stop, Bobby.

1225
01:13:18.776 --> 01:13:20.914
Who are you?

1226
01:13:20.983 --> 01:13:23.153
A few nights ago,
you're wining and dining me.


1227
01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:25.011
Then you make accusations
about my sex life.


1228
01:13:25.077 --> 01:13:27.630
Now you come here and confess?

1229
01:13:27.701 --> 01:13:30.830
I pulled the trigger, not Perry.

1230
01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:33.289
The Robertson killing was
supposed to be my initiation.


1231
01:13:33.364 --> 01:13:35.340
I dropped my gun.

1232
01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:37.388
Perry shot him, not me.

1233
01:13:37.461 --> 01:13:40.275
I think Holland
already knows that.


1234
01:13:49.681 --> 01:13:51.789
He does.

1235
01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.800
He just can't prove it.

1236
01:13:58.162 --> 01:14:00.397
I'll give Holland
the Robertson shooting.


1237
01:14:00.465 --> 01:14:05.221
I'll give him me, Perry,
Van Meter, everything.


1238
01:14:05.297 --> 01:14:06.758
Think about it.

1239
01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:09.386
Like a bullet,
you can't call it back.


1240
01:14:09.457 --> 01:14:11.245
It was a bad shooting.

1241
01:14:11.312 --> 01:14:12.456
I didn't have
to pull the trigger.


1242
01:14:12.529 --> 01:14:15.625
I can't live with that.
Call Holland, please.


1243
01:14:17.006 --> 01:14:20.780
No. You got to tell him
in person.


1244
01:14:54.026 --> 01:14:56.099
Are you willing to say
all this in court...


1245
01:14:56.171 --> 01:14:58.145
with Eldon Perry
and your uncle staring at you?


1246
01:14:58.218 --> 01:14:59.876
Yes, I'm willing.

1247
01:14:59.946 --> 01:15:01.471
You can trust him.

1248
01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:05.512
We have to get Orchard
and Sidwell in custody.


1249
01:15:05.576 --> 01:15:06.822
I'll put together a task force.

1250
01:15:06.889 --> 01:15:07.967
We'll locate them...

1251
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.828
and swoop down on them
like the Lord's fury.


1252
01:15:09.895 --> 01:15:11.587
I want everyone to see this...

1253
01:15:11.657 --> 01:15:13.119
but I need more time.

1254
01:15:13.193 --> 01:15:15.330
Old Jack and Perry
can't know yet.


1255
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.578
Where are you supposed to be?

1256
01:15:16.649 --> 01:15:20.161
At the Academy for
Perry's promotion ceremony.


1257
01:15:20.232 --> 01:15:22.086
You should be there.
Can you handle it?


1258
01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:24.254
I can handle it.

1259
01:15:32.071 --> 01:15:34.043
-I'll be there.
-OK.


1260
01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.809
Hello. Who be it?

1261
01:15:38.884 --> 01:15:40.575
Me be it, fuckhead.

1262
01:15:40.645 --> 01:15:42.587
It's Santa Claus.

1263
01:15:42.661 --> 01:15:44.352
Yes, sir.

1264
01:15:44.422 --> 01:15:46.078
Shut up. You dump that shit?

1265
01:15:46.148 --> 01:15:47.774
Yes, sir, we did.

1266
01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.467
A white police officer's
coming to your house.


1267
01:15:49.539 --> 01:15:52.027
He'll be there shortly.
Cancel his ticket.


1268
01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.724
Smoke a cop?

1269
01:15:53.796 --> 01:15:56.476
He works for me.
He's a serious bad-ass.


1270
01:15:56.546 --> 01:15:57.724
If you slip, he won't.

1271
01:15:57.793 --> 01:15:59.353
Do you know
who I'm talking about?


1272
01:15:59.427 --> 01:16:01.729
Yeah, I know...

1273
01:16:01.795 --> 01:16:05.209
but that's some heavy shit, man.

1274
01:16:05.282 --> 01:16:07.669
Leave him breathing,
I'll make sure you're not.


1275
01:16:07.745 --> 01:16:11.159
That is no shit.
You owe me, asshole.


1276
01:16:11.231 --> 01:16:13.020
He won't make it.

1277
01:16:13.088 --> 01:16:17.433
Don't trip. I'll do his ass
jailhouse style--Chino.


1278
01:16:17.505 --> 01:16:20.155
Just put him away clean,
then leave town.


1279
01:16:20.223 --> 01:16:22.809
L.A.'s too hot.
I don't care where you go--


1280
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.299
Vegas, K.C.--I can set you up
in either place.


1281
01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:28.440
We out then. Fuck L.A.

1282
01:16:28.509 --> 01:16:30.876
Yeah, fuck L.A.

1283
01:16:48.636 --> 01:16:50.359
Eldon, what's wrong?

1284
01:16:50.429 --> 01:16:53.297
Nothing.
It's just Sally and me.


1285
01:16:53.372 --> 01:16:54.549
Fuck, it's over.

1286
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.985
She'll be back.
You want me to call her?


1287
01:16:57.050 --> 01:17:00.977
No. She thinks I'm a monster.

1288
01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:04.465
I know you're hurting now,
but I have a mission for you.


1289
01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.224
Fuck.

1290
01:17:12.089 --> 01:17:14.739
Holland has a witness
to the Robertson shooting.


1291
01:17:14.808 --> 01:17:17.426
I need you to do what you do.

1292
01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.659
There is no witness.

1293
01:17:20.728 --> 01:17:23.411
There is a witness.

1294
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.018
1 2657 Juliet.

1295
01:17:29.528 --> 01:17:31.948
He's a fifty-year-old
Hispanic male.


1296
01:17:32.021 --> 01:17:33.515
Look, Jack...

1297
01:17:35.223 --> 01:17:37.525
Look, Jack,
this is different, man.


1298
01:17:37.591 --> 01:17:39.183
This guy didn't do anything.

1299
01:17:39.253 --> 01:17:41.196
He's a fucking witness.

1300
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:43.789
There's got to be another way
of handling this.


1301
01:17:43.862 --> 01:17:46.097
He's alone in the house
for the next few hours.


1302
01:17:46.164 --> 01:17:48.235
Do you understand?

1303
01:17:48.306 --> 01:17:51.344
I need this one, Eldon,
and it'll all be over.


1304
01:17:51.412 --> 01:17:53.868
Are you listening?

1305
01:17:55.445 --> 01:18:00.495
Are you listening?

1306
01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:05.704
I need this one, Eldon.

1307
01:18:07.026 --> 01:18:10.407
12657 Juliet.

1308
01:18:10.482 --> 01:18:13.416
You're a prince.
See you this afternoon.


1309
01:18:14.962 --> 01:18:16.682
The Academy.

1310
01:18:16.753 --> 01:18:18.029
You forgot, didn't you?

1311
01:18:18.096 --> 01:18:19.950
You made lieutenant,
and you forgot.


1312
01:18:20.016 --> 01:18:21.641
No, I didn't forget.

1313
01:18:37.677 --> 01:18:40.362
Hey, Ed. It's Eldon.

1314
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:47.401
Run an address for me--

1315
01:18:47.469 --> 01:18:50.818
Let me know if law enforcement
has anything in the area.


1316
01:18:50.894 --> 01:18:55.432
Stakes, DUl sweeps, lNS...

1317
01:18:55.501 --> 01:18:58.598
Federal shit,
organized crime, the works.


1318
01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.773
And get me the name
on the utilities bill...


1319
01:19:00.843 --> 01:19:03.298
real quick, please.
I appreciate it.


1320
01:19:14.538 --> 01:19:15.716
Yeah, I'm here.

1321
01:19:21.353 --> 01:19:22.913
Darryl Orchard...

1322
01:19:24.455 --> 01:19:26.758
and Gary Sidwell.

1323
01:19:29.513 --> 01:19:31.487
Yeah. I got it.

1324
01:19:31.561 --> 01:19:32.988
Thanks, man.

1325
01:19:48.133 --> 01:19:50.752
Fuck me.

1326
01:20:00.132 --> 01:20:01.955
You're right, Jack.

1327
01:20:03.461 --> 01:20:05.565
It's all over.

1328
01:20:25.473 --> 01:20:27.360
Yeah.
This is Detective Keough.


1329
01:20:27.424 --> 01:20:31.735
You did. Great job.
Do you have an address?


1330
01:20:31.808 --> 01:20:34.654
12657 Juliet.

1331
01:20:34.719 --> 01:20:37.371
I got it. Thank you.

1332
01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:38.551
That was the lab.

1333
01:20:38.623 --> 01:20:40.151
I gave them a bag
of cigarette butts...


1334
01:20:40.223 --> 01:20:41.749
from the gutter outside
Jack O'Hearts Liquor.


1335
01:20:41.822 --> 01:20:44.407
They got a partial thumbprint
off the cigarette...


1336
01:20:44.478 --> 01:20:46.485
and they matched it directly
to Darryl Orchard.


1337
01:20:46.558 --> 01:20:47.638
What are you doing?

1338
01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:50.972
When Jack finds out,
he'll send Perry to kill him.


1339
01:20:51.038 --> 01:20:52.598
I'm not waiting around for that.

1340
01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:54.676
I'll pick up
Orchard and Sidwell...


1341
01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:57.268
and book them into
protective custody myself.


1342
01:20:59.356 --> 01:21:01.745
5
-King-15 to 15
-Adam.

1343
01:21:01.819 --> 01:21:04.121
1-1-4 to all units.

1344
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:05.978
Be advised.
The verdicts have come in.


1345
01:21:06.043 --> 01:21:08.760
1-1-4 to all units.
Stand by.


1346
01:21:08.828 --> 01:21:11.991
The verdicts are not guilty.
I repeat--not guilty.


1347
01:21:12.059 --> 01:21:14.002
5
-King-15, Adam, come in.

1348
01:21:16.314 --> 01:21:18.517
15
-Adam, come back.

1349
01:21:39.737 --> 01:21:41.590
-White punk.
-What's up, white boy?


1350
01:21:41.655 --> 01:21:42.931
Check it out.

1351
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:46.997
Keep rolling, punk.

1352
01:21:56.373 --> 01:21:58.707
-Heads up.
-What's up with that?


1353
01:21:58.773 --> 01:22:00.016
Punk, what you think
you're doing over here?


1354
01:22:00.085 --> 01:22:01.261
Back up.

1355
01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:02.925
Yeah, slow down.

1356
01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:05.743
Open the window!

1357
01:22:05.812 --> 01:22:08.147
-You better get your ass out!
-All right.


1358
01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:21.865
Tear it up!

1359
01:22:38.128 --> 01:22:39.819
Where the fuck's he going?

1360
01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.229
This nigga think he smart.

1361
01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:42.703
I can't wait to see
that bitch's face...


1362
01:22:42.767 --> 01:22:46.377
when I turn that motherfucker
into a tea bag.


1363
01:22:46.447 --> 01:22:47.656
Let's go.

1364
01:22:48.911 --> 01:22:50.056
Keep your ass low.

1365
01:22:50.127 --> 01:22:52.460
You act like you ain't never
done this before.


1366
01:22:53.773 --> 01:22:55.497
What the fuck is you doing?

1367
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:58.979
I just bought these jeans.

1368
01:23:06.572 --> 01:23:07.748
Stay low.

1369
01:23:07.819 --> 01:23:10.306
He ain't going to smoke my ass.
I'll check over here.


1370
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.249
You see him?

1371
01:23:37.927 --> 01:23:40.197
There he go. Right there.

1372
01:24:21.764 --> 01:24:23.520
All right, Bobby.

1373
01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:53.981
You see him? Anything?

1374
01:25:06.461 --> 01:25:07.574
You see him?

1375
01:25:07.646 --> 01:25:10.296
Nah. Fuck.
I just saw this motherfucker.


1376
01:25:28.699 --> 01:25:29.973
You ready?

1377
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:32.081
Let's get these assholes.

1378
01:25:39.481 --> 01:25:40.562
What?

1379
01:25:40.633 --> 01:25:42.323
They're sending
a whole motherfucking army.


1380
01:25:42.393 --> 01:25:43.701
Where you see that?

1381
01:25:43.769 --> 01:25:46.322
Homeboy's coming up here
all chill and shit.


1382
01:25:57.142 --> 01:25:59.598
Homeboy's here
with a fine-ass sister.


1383
01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:02.190
She coming here with a boo-ya,
all chill and shit.


1384
01:26:02.262 --> 01:26:05.773
That's a damn shame
that we got to kill her.


1385
01:26:05.845 --> 01:26:09.141
Just shoot the motherfuckers
when you see them.


1386
01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:11.888
This ain't the liquor store.
These niggas shoot back.


1387
01:27:06.670 --> 01:27:09.255
Here's the situation
from South Central.


1388
01:27:09.325 --> 01:27:10.787
Look at that.

1389
01:27:10.862 --> 01:27:13.612
Terrible. And there's
no police presence down here.


1390
01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:16.525
They will not enter the area.

1391
01:27:16.588 --> 01:27:18.018
No. There's no--

1392
01:27:18.092 --> 01:27:20.361
There's no shutting down
Florence.


1393
01:27:23.275 --> 01:27:25.958
We're telling the LAPD
to do that now.


1394
01:27:26.025 --> 01:27:29.475
Shut Florence Boulevard down
and Normandie.


1395
01:28:51.489 --> 01:28:53.431
I snitched you out, Eldon.

1396
01:28:53.505 --> 01:28:56.407
I snitched you out.

1397
01:29:09.503 --> 01:29:10.964
Don't you touch him.

1398
01:29:11.038 --> 01:29:12.697
Don't you dare touch him.

1399
01:29:16.156 --> 01:29:19.352
This should be
you lying here, not Bobby.


1400
01:29:19.422 --> 01:29:22.936
Your blood should be
spilling here, not his!


1401
01:29:23.006 --> 01:29:27.511
You filled his head
with all this bullshit!


1402
01:29:27.581 --> 01:29:34.168
I hope that you burn in Hell,
Eldon Perry.


1403
01:29:34.234 --> 01:29:37.432
You evil motherfucker.

1404
01:30:11.702 --> 01:30:13.557
I'll call it in.

1405
01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:50.124
5
-Y-15, shots fired.

1406
01:30:50.193 --> 01:30:53.007
My partner's down,
and another officer needs help.


1407
01:30:53.072 --> 01:30:55.343
12657 Juliet.

1408
01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:57.233
5
-Y-15, roger.

1409
01:30:57.299 --> 01:31:01.738
All units in 12
-Adam-18,

1410
01:31:01.809 --> 01:31:05.036
Handle Code 3,
state intentions.


1411
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:13.574
I'm in pursuit
of the suspects...


1412
01:31:13.647 --> 01:31:16.167
Darryl Orchard
and Gary Sidwell.


1413
01:31:46.636 --> 01:31:47.845
Get him!

1414
01:31:57.672 --> 01:31:59.560
Get out of the street!

1415
01:32:11.432 --> 01:32:12.772
Get out of the street!

1416
01:32:26.788 --> 01:32:29.024
-Shit!
-Come on, now!


1417
01:33:33.501 --> 01:33:35.257
Son of a bitch!

1418
01:33:43.708 --> 01:33:45.595
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait, wait!


1419
01:33:45.661 --> 01:33:47.383
I'm cool!

1420
01:33:57.788 --> 01:33:59.792
Who's the bitch ass, nigga?
Fuck y'all!


1421
01:33:59.865 --> 01:34:02.288
Goddamn! Fuck!

1422
01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.114
Fuck you, Sidwell.

1423
01:34:43.093 --> 01:34:45.066
Get in.

1424
01:35:14.673 --> 01:35:16.777
Cuff yourself. Get them on.

1425
01:35:16.849 --> 01:35:18.255
Put them on!

1426
01:35:19.854 --> 01:35:21.994
Darryl,
I'm going to kill you...


1427
01:35:22.065 --> 01:35:24.485
as soon as I think
you're lying to me, understand?


1428
01:35:24.559 --> 01:35:27.460
Take a look in there,
motherfucker.


1429
01:35:27.534 --> 01:35:29.869
Come on, man, lie to me.
Lie to me now!


1430
01:35:29.936 --> 01:35:31.845
Van Meter tell you
to hit Jack O'Hearts?


1431
01:35:31.921 --> 01:35:33.959
Yeah, man, yeah.

1432
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:35.721
You been hitting safes for him?

1433
01:35:35.791 --> 01:35:38.887
Damn right.
Made that nigga a gang of money.


1434
01:35:38.956 --> 01:35:41.062
I bought that nigga a house.

1435
01:35:41.133 --> 01:35:42.987
Shut up and listen to me.

1436
01:35:43.052 --> 01:35:44.513
Van Meter
tell you to ambush me?


1437
01:35:44.588 --> 01:35:46.182
He tell you to ambush me?

1438
01:35:48.972 --> 01:35:51.394
A simple fucking task.
You couldn't get it right.


1439
01:35:53.196 --> 01:35:55.398
You dumb asses
wasted my partner.


1440
01:35:55.466 --> 01:35:57.091
Your partner?

1441
01:35:57.163 --> 01:36:00.608
This whole city's
about to burn the fuck down.


1442
01:36:32.391 --> 01:36:34.595
And I want to thank
my wife and children...


1443
01:36:34.663 --> 01:36:38.371
for staying with me
through the 16 years in Metro.


1444
01:36:38.439 --> 01:36:40.826
My years with
this department...


1445
01:36:40.901 --> 01:36:44.829
Major 415s and Code 3 traffic
all over South Bureau.


1446
01:36:44.901 --> 01:36:47.388
Captain Lennox
wants permission to deploy.


1447
01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.664
Tell Lennox to get off your ass.

1448
01:36:49.733 --> 01:36:52.548
I can't do anything till
you get the Chief on the phone.


1449
01:36:52.612 --> 01:36:55.000
He's at a fund-raising luncheon
in Brentwood...


1450
01:36:55.077 --> 01:36:57.116
with specific orders
not to be disturbed.


1451
01:36:57.188 --> 01:37:00.831
Frank,
get the Chief on the phone.


1452
01:37:02.978 --> 01:37:06.907
Thank you. Thank you.

1453
01:37:06.979 --> 01:37:09.661
Apparently Eldon Perry...

1454
01:37:09.731 --> 01:37:11.487
our final officer
to be promoted...


1455
01:37:11.552 --> 01:37:14.041
was unable to attend
this afternoon.


1456
01:37:14.113 --> 01:37:17.943
Whoa! Nobody moves
till I get my bars.


1457
01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.003
Thanks, Sal.

1458
01:37:35.518 --> 01:37:37.689
I thought
he should be here for this.


1459
01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:41.524
Congratulations, Dad.

1460
01:37:41.599 --> 01:37:43.288
I'm sorry.

1461
01:37:46.908 --> 01:37:51.480
Eldon Perry.
Here's a cop when you need one.


1462
01:37:51.548 --> 01:37:53.437
This is to certify--

1463
01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.541
Forget the formalities.
This is what I came for.


1464
01:37:55.613 --> 01:37:57.499
Thanks a lot.

1465
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:09.398
Jack Van Meter asked me
to say a few words today...


1466
01:38:09.468 --> 01:38:12.761
so I guess I'll say a few words.

1467
01:38:14.587 --> 01:38:17.368
Law enforcement has taken
a lot of dings lately...


1468
01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:18.777
and I'd like to congratulate...

1469
01:38:18.841 --> 01:38:21.907
our four fellow officers
on their acquittal today.


1470
01:38:25.335 --> 01:38:26.581
It's a hell of a job we got.

1471
01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:29.584
A cop's the last person
a civilian wants to see...


1472
01:38:29.656 --> 01:38:31.444
until some shitbag
shoves a gun in his face...


1473
01:38:31.514 --> 01:38:34.478
and then we can't get there
fast enough, right?


1474
01:38:35.895 --> 01:38:37.553
You know, law enforcement...

1475
01:38:37.624 --> 01:38:41.233
it's been
my family's business...


1476
01:38:41.302 --> 01:38:43.507
since Los Angeles
was a frontier township.


1477
01:38:43.574 --> 01:38:46.803
I actually remember sitting
on my granddaddy's lap...


1478
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:49.552
Iistening to stories
about chasing horse thieves...


1479
01:38:49.622 --> 01:38:51.508
and rustlers into
the Santa Monica mountains...


1480
01:38:51.573 --> 01:38:54.768
and coming back with a bad guy
tied to his Appaloosa.


1481
01:38:54.836 --> 01:38:57.652
And when my dad
got into the business...


1482
01:38:57.716 --> 01:39:01.426
there was black and whites,
traffic signals.


1483
01:39:01.492 --> 01:39:02.866
But the job hadn't changed.

1484
01:39:02.933 --> 01:39:08.016
My dad preyed on the predators
that preyed on this city.


1485
01:39:08.083 --> 01:39:10.602
There was never any doubt
what I was going to be.


1486
01:39:10.674 --> 01:39:13.390
I was a Police Explorer
by the age of nine.


1487
01:39:13.459 --> 01:39:19.305
I was a teenager when
the Watts Riots came around.


1488
01:39:19.378 --> 01:39:20.686
Anyway, I can remember...

1489
01:39:20.753 --> 01:39:24.047
going out with my dad
on the second night.


1490
01:39:24.112 --> 01:39:26.731
There was this Woolworth's
that was burning.


1491
01:39:26.799 --> 01:39:30.118
And I remember these looters
running in and out.


1492
01:39:30.193 --> 01:39:31.785
Every time they'd run out...

1493
01:39:31.857 --> 01:39:33.645
my dad would take
a potshot at them...


1494
01:39:33.712 --> 01:39:36.461
with this deer rifle
he'd brought from home.


1495
01:39:36.528 --> 01:39:38.732
Anyway, he gave it to me
and this looter ran out.


1496
01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.741
I winged him in the arm
and he ran back inside.


1497
01:39:40.814 --> 01:39:42.756
That's when
the roof collapsed...


1498
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:45.098
and the whole
goddamned building caved in.


1499
01:39:45.166 --> 01:39:48.069
I guess they all burned up.
Nobody got out.


1500
01:39:50.256 --> 01:39:52.325
Tell Jimmy to get him down.
He's drunk.


1501
01:39:54.605 --> 01:39:57.091
That was my dad.

1502
01:39:58.315 --> 01:40:01.894
Jack says he's drunk again
and wants him off the stage.


1503
01:40:01.965 --> 01:40:05.990
I will take care of it.
Leave it alone.


1504
01:40:06.059 --> 01:40:08.295
That's Eldon Perry lll...

1505
01:40:08.363 --> 01:40:10.697
right there
next to his mom.


1506
01:40:10.763 --> 01:40:14.886
He'll never be a cop.
He hates cops.


1507
01:40:14.954 --> 01:40:16.776
I love him.

1508
01:40:16.843 --> 01:40:20.617
And I thank God
that I was just too busy...


1509
01:40:20.683 --> 01:40:24.227
to pass on to him
what my granddaddy...


1510
01:40:24.296 --> 01:40:26.238
passed on to my daddy
and he passed on to me.


1511
01:40:26.313 --> 01:40:29.695
I was raised up
to be a gunfighter.


1512
01:40:29.768 --> 01:40:33.151
I made a career of going after
the most dangerous...


1513
01:40:33.225 --> 01:40:35.559
parasitic sons of bitches
to walk this planet...


1514
01:40:35.624 --> 01:40:37.795
and I was happier
than the devil in Hell.


1515
01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:40.067
I'd fabricate evidence
to bring some asshole in...


1516
01:40:40.135 --> 01:40:43.005
or I'd lie on reports
and to investigators...


1517
01:40:43.079 --> 01:40:45.467
and I'd sure as hell
stretch the truth in court.


1518
01:40:45.542 --> 01:40:46.852
And if anybody
would mess with us...


1519
01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:48.706
we just muscled them,
right, Jack?


1520
01:40:48.774 --> 01:40:50.847
Or blackmail them.

1521
01:40:50.918 --> 01:40:52.545
What the hell?
Everybody's got a secret.


1522
01:40:52.615 --> 01:40:55.996
It's a tough job,
but I was a good soldier.


1523
01:40:56.069 --> 01:40:58.110
Yeah.
Just taking orders...


1524
01:40:58.181 --> 01:41:00.155
from my commanding officer
Jack Van Meter.


1525
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:02.878
Whenever Jack said,
"Eldon, do what you do"...


1526
01:41:02.948 --> 01:41:05.730
I carved "Case cleared"
on a casket with my knife...


1527
01:41:05.797 --> 01:41:09.210
because I figured,
"What the hell? Jack's God."


1528
01:41:09.284 --> 01:41:12.601
Sometimes, Jack,
you work like God.


1529
01:41:12.677 --> 01:41:15.293
You work in
some mysterious ways, man.


1530
01:41:15.363 --> 01:41:17.337
Thanks a lot, Eldon.
Thank you.


1531
01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:21.501
It was Van Meter
that ordered me...


1532
01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:24.702
to pin the Jack O'Hearts
homicides...


1533
01:41:24.771 --> 01:41:27.487
on a couple of ex-cons...

1534
01:41:27.553 --> 01:41:28.697
that didn't have anything
to do with it.


1535
01:41:28.770 --> 01:41:33.175
He ordered me to set them up
for the kill, too.


1536
01:41:33.247 --> 01:41:36.116
So, acting on
some information from me...


1537
01:41:36.192 --> 01:41:37.719
SWAT took one down
during a raid.


1538
01:41:37.792 --> 01:41:42.647
But I made my partner kill
the other one in cold blood.


1539
01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:47.127
You got to be heartless
in my line of work.


1540
01:41:47.198 --> 01:41:51.158
And my partner Bobby Keough...

1541
01:41:55.198 --> 01:41:57.499
He had a good one...

1542
01:41:57.566 --> 01:41:59.323
and it cost him.

1543
01:42:01.436 --> 01:42:04.981
The real
Jack O'Hearts killers...


1544
01:42:05.052 --> 01:42:08.630
turned out to be a couple
of snitches of Van Meter's.


1545
01:42:08.699 --> 01:42:12.563
Bobby tried to arrest them,
but he didn't make it.


1546
01:42:12.637 --> 01:42:14.197
They cut him in half.

1547
01:42:14.267 --> 01:42:16.055
He's lying dead
on a concrete slab...


1548
01:42:16.123 --> 01:42:17.586
somewhere in
South Central right now...


1549
01:42:17.659 --> 01:42:20.024
because he walked into an ambush
Van Meter set up for me.


1550
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:21.683
Isn't that right, Jack?

1551
01:42:21.753 --> 01:42:24.951
Eldon...
it's going to be OK.


1552
01:42:25.018 --> 01:42:27.026
Those of us here
who love you...


1553
01:42:27.097 --> 01:42:28.592
want you to get down
from there...


1554
01:42:28.666 --> 01:42:30.158
before you embarrass yourself
any further.


1555
01:42:30.234 --> 01:42:32.916
To those members of the press
who are gathered here...


1556
01:42:32.985 --> 01:42:36.148
I would ask you to consider
only that this fine man...


1557
01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:38.605
a great LAPD cop...

1558
01:42:38.679 --> 01:42:42.063
has demons that sometimes
get the better of him.


1559
01:42:42.137 --> 01:42:43.446
Discretion, please.

1560
01:42:47.256 --> 01:42:50.931
I'm slow, Jack,
but I get there.


1561
01:42:50.999 --> 01:42:54.096
I couldn't figure out
why you'd throw me over...


1562
01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:55.725
for a couple
of crackheads...


1563
01:42:55.796 --> 01:42:59.542
until Orchard told me
the safes were for you.


1564
01:42:59.607 --> 01:43:03.022
It was simple--
just about money.


1565
01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:05.035
So I brought Orchard
in as a witness.


1566
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:08.076
He's back there in the custody
of Robbery-Homicide.


1567
01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:10.669
He had quite a lot to say...

1568
01:43:10.741 --> 01:43:12.201
but not as much as me.

1569
01:43:12.276 --> 01:43:14.514
That man is a well-known
crack addict...


1570
01:43:14.581 --> 01:43:16.752
a heroin user,
a bottom-feeding petty thug...


1571
01:43:16.821 --> 01:43:18.761
with a police record

1572
01:43:18.835 --> 01:43:21.070
Eldon, you are an alcoholic!

1573
01:43:21.138 --> 01:43:23.115
We have all tried to help you...

1574
01:43:23.187 --> 01:43:25.836
but there comes a time when
support becomes enablement...


1575
01:43:25.905 --> 01:43:27.530
and we are well past that point.

1576
01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:28.911
Get the hell down from there.

1577
01:43:28.979 --> 01:43:32.394
While you're grandstanding,
the city is starting to burn.


1578
01:43:32.467 --> 01:43:33.806
If this city's
starting to burn, Jack...


1579
01:43:33.873 --> 01:43:35.533
it's because of guys
like you and me...


1580
01:43:35.603 --> 01:43:37.095
and I may be
a goddamn alcoholic...


1581
01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:38.598
but that doesn't mean
I can't tell the truth.


1582
01:43:38.672 --> 01:43:41.322
I got all the deep, deep dirt
right here.


1583
01:43:41.392 --> 01:43:43.758
Somebody put the cuffs on me
and let me start talking.


1584
01:43:43.823 --> 01:43:45.679
We'll let the shit fall
wherever it wants to.


1585
01:43:45.742 --> 01:43:47.599
Who's got the cuffs?

1586
01:43:47.665 --> 01:43:49.999
Come on.
Who's got my back here?


1587
01:43:50.064 --> 01:43:51.624
Somebody, come on.
Who's got the cuffs?


1588
01:43:51.697 --> 01:43:54.247
For Christ's sake,
somebody back me up here!


1589
01:43:58.767 --> 01:44:00.457
Can we wrap this up?

1590
01:44:00.525 --> 01:44:01.956
Sergeant Jakes, arrest him.

1591
01:44:06.573 --> 01:44:07.947
Are you sure about this?

1592
01:44:08.014 --> 01:44:10.435
Just do your job, Sergeant.

1593
01:44:10.509 --> 01:44:12.712
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking...


1594
01:44:12.782 --> 01:44:13.991
think again.

1595
01:44:14.061 --> 01:44:16.448
Perry is delusional
in the extreme.


1596
01:44:16.523 --> 01:44:17.831
You're going down.

1597
01:44:17.899 --> 01:44:19.045
Then the whole department
goes down with me...


1598
01:44:19.116 --> 01:44:20.392
starting at the very top.

1599
01:44:20.462 --> 01:44:21.638
I got files on everybody.

1600
01:44:21.707 --> 01:44:23.945
I got photographs,
cancelled checks.


1601
01:44:24.012 --> 01:44:26.432
No dirty little secret
gets by me.


1602
01:44:26.507 --> 01:44:28.449
I take the fall,
everybody takes the fall.


1603
01:44:28.523 --> 01:44:29.983
If that's what it takes.

1604
01:44:30.058 --> 01:44:32.511
It would be suicidal for you
to arrest me here.


1605
01:44:32.586 --> 01:44:35.784
Cameras running,
a riot in the streets...


1606
01:44:35.852 --> 01:44:37.573
no investigation, no inquiry.

1607
01:44:37.642 --> 01:44:39.300
Is that the way
a Chief behaves?


1608
01:44:39.370 --> 01:44:41.409
You should've taken the deal
we offered you.


1609
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.171
You're the one
who has to make a deal.


1610
01:44:43.242 --> 01:44:45.247
I'm the one
you have to deal with now.


1611
01:44:45.319 --> 01:44:48.101
I'm not going to arrest you,
because I don't have to.


1612
01:44:48.167 --> 01:44:49.956
Everything's been set in motion.

1613
01:44:50.023 --> 01:44:53.284
You're finished, Jack.

1614
01:44:53.352 --> 01:44:55.262
You don't know
what you've started.


1615
01:44:55.335 --> 01:44:58.631
I didn't start anything.
You did.


1616
01:45:01.831 --> 01:45:03.770
I'm not going down.

1617
01:45:03.845 --> 01:45:07.164
Yeah, you are, Jack,
because I'm taking you down.


1618
01:45:07.238 --> 01:45:08.733
Are you listening to me?

1619
01:45:11.814 --> 01:45:13.187
Are you listening?

1620
01:45:15.013 --> 01:45:18.808
Good...because they are.

1621
01:45:20.931 --> 01:45:22.110
They'll book him
within the hour.


1622
01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:24.068
He needs a lawyer.
A good one.


1623
01:45:24.133 --> 01:45:26.651
Report to your
"A" and "B" Watch Commanders.


1624
01:45:26.724 --> 01:45:29.570
We're officially
on tactical alert.


1625
01:45:33.954 --> 01:45:35.742
They finally nailed
Jack Van Meter.


1626
01:45:35.809 --> 01:45:38.177
We got a story now.

1627
01:45:40.514 --> 01:45:44.222
I'll run it exactly
as you said it--word for word.


1628
01:46:01.311 --> 01:46:02.969
There's a riot alert
all over the city.


1629
01:46:03.038 --> 01:46:05.340
Sergeant Jakes...

1630
01:46:05.405 --> 01:46:06.931
uncuff him.

1631
01:46:17.596 --> 01:46:19.288
Look at that.

1632
01:46:19.357 --> 01:46:22.259
The whole damn city's
going to burn.


1633
01:46:22.331 --> 01:46:24.218
It'll get ugly
before it gets better.


1634
01:46:24.284 --> 01:46:26.325
How ugly do you think
it'll get for me?


1635
01:46:26.396 --> 01:46:28.763
Ugly.

1636
01:46:34.012 --> 01:46:35.505
Hey, Chief.

1637
01:46:39.066 --> 01:46:42.415
What's the worst prison we got,
San Quentin?


1638
01:46:42.488 --> 01:46:45.786
I'd rather go to Lompoc, man.

1639
01:46:45.850 --> 01:46:48.849
Or even Tehachapi.

1640
01:46:50.201 --> 01:46:51.891
I'll see what I can do.

1641
01:48:00.198 --> 01:48:10.198
THE END
