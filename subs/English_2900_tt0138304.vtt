1
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.692
I hate this part.

2
00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:39.637
You're still here, but I know
you're going, and I hate that.


3
00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:42.823
Well, I'll call you, baby.

4
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:44.992
Don't tease me.

5
00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:51.065
I miss you so much when you're gone.

6
00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:53.917
I miss you, too, baby.

7
00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:55.527
Listen.

8
00:00:55.627 --> 00:00:57.446
Last time Streck told me...

9
00:00:57.546 --> 00:00:59.198
...if I bellyached about you
for one more minute...


10
00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.451
...he was gonna toss my ass
right off the ship.


11
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:07.848
You tell Streck your ass belongs to me...

12
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.376
...and he can keep his hands off it.

13
00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:12.476
All right.

14
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:18.266
My class wants you
to come by when you get back.


15
00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.262
I think I can arrange a visit...

16
00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:24.362
...if you're nice.

17
00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:28.408
How nice?

18
00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:35.332
You like fruit?

19
00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:42.589
Well...

20
00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:46.287
Come here a minute.

21
00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:48.387
Come here.

22
00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:51.556
Ain't that a peach?

23
00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:55.212
It that for me?

24
00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:57.312
That's for you.

25
00:01:58.023 --> 00:02:00.384
Victory,
this is Mission Control.


26
00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:01.760
All systems are go.

27
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.971
Flight Commander,
all computers are functioning.


28
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:05.306
The crew of Victory...

29
00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:07.141
...has been given a go for orbit operations...

30
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:08.517
...by the Mission Control Center.

31
00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:10.644
Crew members are doing well...

32
00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:13.731
...and all systems of the orbiter
are performing satisfactorily.


33
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:14.940
Three...

34
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.317
...two...

35
00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:17.651
...one...

36
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:19.751
...zero, and liftoff.

37
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.116
Mission Control,
we have left the pad.


38
00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:25.284
Roger that, Victory.

39
00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:28.303
You are go for throttle up.

40
00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.538
Mission Control,
this is Victory.


41
00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:30.706
We have throttled up.

42
00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:33.781
It's a fine day fortifying,
Houston.


43
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.770
All systems are go.

44
00:02:44.778 --> 00:02:46.778
Pineapples!

45
00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:49.099
What do they have in Kansas?

46
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.726
Corn!

47
00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:55.247
Yes, corn,
and what about Georgia?


48
00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.857
What do they have in Georgia?

49
00:02:56.957 --> 00:02:58.359
Peaches!

50
00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.878
Very good.

51
00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.072
And what do we have here in Florida?

52
00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:06.008
Oranges!

53
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.427
And rocket ships.

54
00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.430
Yes, Calvin, and rocket ships.

55
00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:14.083
Mrs. Armacost,
you have a phone call.


56
00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:15.709
Thank you, Brian.

57
00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.378
OK, let's go to page seven.

58
00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:20.439
And work quietly, OK?

59
00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:26.220
Mrs. Armacost.

60
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.055
Yes, this is Jillian Armacost.

61
00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:30.391
Mrs. Armacost,
NASA communications.


62
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.601
We have your husband for you.

63
00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:34.395
Go ahead, Commander.

64
00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:36.747
Jillian?
- Spencer?


65
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:37.940
Yeah, I told you I'd call.

66
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.525
It's amazing, isn't it?

67
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.443
Yes, amazing.

68
00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:43.543
Hey, Jill.

69
00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:47.297
What are you wearing?

70
00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:52.162
Come on, now.
Ain't nobody else listening.


71
00:03:52.262 --> 00:03:53.622
Not exactly, Commander.

72
00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:55.291
Including Houston and JPL...

73
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:58.836
...there are about 300
folks on the line today.


74
00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:01.046
It's a nice day down there, huh?

75
00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:02.589
Beautiful.

76
00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.109
Can you see outside, Jill?

77
00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:09.638
Fifteen seconds, Commander.

78
00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:11.738
I'm right above you.

79
00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:15.269
You lookin' up, honey?

80
00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.229
Ten seconds.

81
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.499
Won't you smile for me, huh?

82
00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:22.541
I already am.

83
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:26.346
He called you from outer space?

84
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.074
Well, technically from Earth's orbit, but yes.

85
00:04:29.174 --> 00:04:30.326
He called me from the orbiter.

86
00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:33.329
Stanley won't even call me
from the Beef 'N' Burger...


87
00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:35.998
...and you get a call from outer space...

88
00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:38.000
...the Earth's orbit, whatever.

89
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.918
Technically speaking,
Jill, you scored.


90
00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:42.504
I don't get it.
We grew up in the same house.


91
00:04:42.604 --> 00:04:43.756
You land Johnny Rocket Boy.

92
00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:44.923
I keep getting different versions...

93
00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:47.743
...of Throws
-Up
-On
-Himself Elmo.

94
00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:51.138
I bet he's good at the little
things, too, isn't he?


95
00:04:51.238 --> 00:04:54.408
What little things?

96
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.436
Just those little things that mean so much.

97
00:04:57.536 --> 00:04:58.938
It's true.

98
00:04:59.038 --> 00:05:01.732
You know,
men are like parking spaces.


99
00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:02.900
All the good ones are taken...

100
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.910
...and all the available
ones are handicapped.


101
00:05:08.464 --> 00:05:10.464
What?

102
00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:18.916
And now back to our program.

103
00:05:19.016 --> 00:05:20.960
Oh, man, something happened.

104
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.060
Come on.

105
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.940
Keep checking.

106
00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:33.222
Mrs. Armacost,
I'm Sherman Reese from NASA.


107
00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:35.516
Um, it's about your husband.

108
00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:36.850
What's happened?

109
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.185
We'd like you to come with us.

110
00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:39.770
I have a car right outside.

111
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.689
There's something about Spencer!

112
00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.065
Please, Mrs. Armacost.

113
00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:44.692
Captain Streck's wife is already there.

114
00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:46.568
The director wants--

115
00:05:46.668 --> 00:05:49.154
The condition of Armacost and Streck...

116
00:05:49.254 --> 00:05:51.031
...as well as the
rest of the shuttle crew...

117
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:52.616
...is at this time unknown.

118
00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:54.410
Reporting live from NASA...

119
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.953
Is my husband dead?

120
00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:57.621
Ma'am, I don't know anything...

121
00:05:57.721 --> 00:05:59.039
...about the condition of your husband.

122
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.249
Is my husband dead?

123
00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.435
Ma'am, I just don't know.

124
00:06:03.477 --> 00:06:06.313
Then take me to someone who does.

125
00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:20.561
He's dead.

126
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:21.937
I know he's dead.

127
00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:24.927
They're not dead.
They're not dead.


128
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.961
What have they told you?

129
00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:30.195
Nothing.

130
00:06:30.295 --> 00:06:32.675
They won't tell me anything.

131
00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:35.909
Mrs. Streck, Mrs. Armacost.

132
00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.304
First, your husbands are alive.

133
00:06:39.346 --> 00:06:40.414
Oh, thank God.

134
00:06:40.514 --> 00:06:41.790
They're back on the orbiter right now...

135
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.918
...and we're gonna bring 'em down
immediately.


136
00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:46.170
What happened up there?

137
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.963
Your husbands were outside the orbiter...

138
00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:50.799
...performing some repairs on a satellite.

139
00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:51.967
There was an explosion...

140
00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:55.977
...and we lost contact
with both astronauts...


141
00:06:55.988 --> 00:06:57.806
...for about two minutes.

142
00:06:57.906 --> 00:07:00.117
You lost contact?

143
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.645
What do you mean you lost contact?

144
00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:05.731
After the explosion,
they drifted behind the shuttle.


145
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:07.775
We had to bring the craft around...

146
00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.443
...a hundred and eighty
degrees to get them.


147
00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:10.611
They were all alone?

148
00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:12.655
But now they're back on the shuttle...

149
00:07:12.755 --> 00:07:15.866
...and they'll be back down here
as soon as we can manage it.


150
00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:18.160
Mr. Reese here will stay with you...

151
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.980
...until we can get you to them.

152
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:27.121
They were all alone out there,
Jillian.


153
00:07:29.521 --> 00:07:30.965
It's OK.

154
00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:32.341
They're alive.

155
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:36.679
This will give you a view
from the shuttle as they land.


156
00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:38.973
Would you like me to
get you the link- up?

157
00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:41.075
I'll get the link-up.

158
00:07:57.216 --> 00:08:00.701
Twenty-five seconds to reentry interface.

159
00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:05.806
Maintain descent.

160
00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:12.044
Wind shear-- this is minimum trajectory.

161
00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:16.502
Velocity at twenty-six hundred F.B.P.

162
00:08:19.154 --> 00:08:21.015
At two hundred thirty-five knots...

163
00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:23.115
...maintaining descent.

164
00:08:23.826 --> 00:08:25.826
Eight at two-fifteen...

165
00:08:25.828 --> 00:08:27.830
...five at two-ten...

166
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:29.871
...two at two hundred.

167
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.110
One foot.

168
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.029
Ground Control, this is Victory.

169
00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.447
We are down.

170
00:08:36.547 --> 00:08:38.407
He's breathing on his own.

171
00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:39.742
His vital functions are good.

172
00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:42.911
As far as we can tell, there has
been no brain damage...


173
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.455
...so it should only
be a matter of time...

174
00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:47.875
...before your husband
regains consciousness.


175
00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:51.035
So he's going to be OK?
- Absolutely.


176
00:08:53.105 --> 00:08:54.340
And what about Alex?

177
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.520
Captain Streck is an older man
than your husband.


178
00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:02.573
There was a tremendous strain
on his heart.


179
00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:07.868
Natalie.

180
00:09:42.738 --> 00:09:44.738
Hey, you.

181
00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.876
I missed you so much.

182
00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:06.996
How are you?

183
00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:09.096
I'm all right.

184
00:10:09.306 --> 00:10:10.541
Yeah, I'm all right.

185
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:12.641
Good.

186
00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:15.435
I got to pee.

187
00:10:21.443 --> 00:10:24.078
I'll see what I can do for you.

188
00:10:26.698 --> 00:10:28.698
Where's Alex?

189
00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:32.953
Is he all right?

190
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:51.471
Spencer, what is that?

191
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.311
Did you feel that?

192
00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:01.233
My God, what is that?

193
00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:03.275
Honey, I'm here.

194
00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:06.280
God damn it!

195
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:08.321
What can I do?

196
00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:13.326
Jesus. Hold him.

197
00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:20.417
Help him!

198
00:11:42.357 --> 00:11:44.357
Clear!

199
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:49.156
That's it.
He's still at zero.


200
00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.058
Nothing.

201
00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:52.393
Charging, three hundred.

202
00:11:52.493 --> 00:11:54.493
Clear.

203
00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:04.669
We got him.

204
00:12:05.964 --> 00:12:08.259
Hold off on that intubator.

205
00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:12.621
Stand by with some dopamine.

206
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:14.846
Let's get an EKG prepped.

207
00:12:31.198 --> 00:12:32.391
What did you say?

208
00:12:32.491 --> 00:12:35.811
Well, I told that bloated
fast-food-eating motherfucker...


209
00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:38.397
...that we'd never have gotten
a chance to be heroes...


210
00:12:38.497 --> 00:12:40.482
...if he hadn't cut our
budget and forced us...


211
00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:43.110
...to put that piece of shit
exploding satellite into orbit.


212
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.210
Really?

213
00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:46.614
And then what happened?

214
00:12:46.714 --> 00:12:49.825
Said he'd never been talked to
like that before by anybody...


215
00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:51.660
...and I said I didn't give
a big hairy rat's ass...


216
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.289
...and if he ever called me again,
I would track him down...


217
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:58.125
...roust him out of his bunk, pull
his pants around his ankles...


218
00:12:58.225 --> 00:12:59.418
...and spank him with a coat hanger...

219
00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:01.420
...right there in front
of his wife and children.


220
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.713
Well, that's real subtle.

221
00:13:02.813 --> 00:13:05.899
Yeah, I thought it pretty subtle.

222
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:07.926
You want to tell me what you
really said to the president?


223
00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:11.071
Yeah.
I thanked him for his call.


224
00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:14.099
Then I asked him what he was wearing...

225
00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:17.102
...and he started breathing kind of heavy...

226
00:13:17.202 --> 00:13:19.021
...made a funny noise, and hung up.

227
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:20.189
What do you think that means?

228
00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:21.398
Maybe he's not into you.

229
00:13:21.498 --> 00:13:22.608
I guess not.

230
00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:24.526
She got balloons.
Why didn't I get no balloons?


231
00:13:24.626 --> 00:13:25.694
Because you got candy.

232
00:13:25.794 --> 00:13:28.238
I ain't got no candy.
- You got candy.


233
00:13:28.338 --> 00:13:30.888
Where's my candy?
- In the car.


234
00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:35.262
Does he ever talk about it?

235
00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:38.832
Did Spencer ever say anything
about what happened up there?


236
00:13:38.932 --> 00:13:42.162
What it was like when they were alone?

237
00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:46.273
It's going to be OK.

238
00:13:46.315 --> 00:13:48.315
They're back.

239
00:13:49.693 --> 00:13:52.498
He doesn't talk about it,
does he?


240
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.847
Neither does Alex.

241
00:13:53.947 --> 00:13:56.075
Never mentions it--...

242
00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:58.116
...not a word.

243
00:13:58.786 --> 00:14:00.826
Well, do you blame them?

244
00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:07.695
Those two minutes,
they almost died, Jillian.


245
00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.071
But they didn't.

246
00:14:09.171 --> 00:14:11.171
But they almost did.

247
00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:14.243
To go through that together...

248
00:14:14.343 --> 00:14:16.120
...to come back,
and never talk about it...


249
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.280
...never bring it up-- it's bizarre.

250
00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:23.683
It's over.

251
00:14:24.103 --> 00:14:26.103
Honey...

252
00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:30.923
I know this has to
be hard for you, too.

253
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.073
It just scares me that they act
like it never happened.


254
00:14:41.662 --> 00:14:42.730
There you go.

255
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.940
Thanks, Commander.
- You got it, buddy.


256
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.505
Hey, Mike, what did he write?

257
00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:49.987
Guess what.

258
00:14:50.087 --> 00:14:52.087
What?

259
00:14:54.633 --> 00:14:57.268
I'm resigning from the service.

260
00:14:59.054 --> 00:15:00.664
Because of what happened?

261
00:15:00.764 --> 00:15:03.909
Well, it's because I'm done up there.

262
00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:09.898
I got an offer from an aerospace firm--...

263
00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:11.938
...executive position...

264
00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:14.693
...lots of money.

265
00:15:14.695 --> 00:15:17.222
I mean boatloads of money, Jill.

266
00:15:17.322 --> 00:15:20.476
What do you know
about being an executive?


267
00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:21.852
You're a flier, Spence.

268
00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:23.437
No, honey.

269
00:15:23.537 --> 00:15:26.190
What I am is a true American hero.

270
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.734
The president of
the United States said that...


271
00:15:28.834 --> 00:15:30.834
...and you heard it.

272
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:34.421
Anyway...

273
00:15:35.007 --> 00:15:37.201
Apparently,
it's pretty good for business...


274
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:42.231
...to have a true American hero
on the company letter head.


275
00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:48.187
The thing of it is, Jill...

276
00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:51.458
...is that the company headquarters...

277
00:15:54.276 --> 00:15:56.401
...it's in New York City.

278
00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.907
You're kidding, right?

279
00:15:59.948 --> 00:16:02.451
New York?

280
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:04.453
You hate New York.

281
00:16:04.453 --> 00:16:05.646
Too many people, remember?

282
00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:07.746
I know.

283
00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:13.097
We have a life here, Spencer--...

284
00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:17.104
...my job, our friends, everything.

285
00:16:20.636 --> 00:16:23.013
So, what do you say?

286
00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:25.055
Will you do it?

287
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.187
Will you move to
New York City with me?

288
00:16:32.564 --> 00:16:35.284
You've always been there for me.

289
00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:39.029
I want to be there for you.

290
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.242
Let's go to New York.

291
00:16:45.035 --> 00:16:47.037
What do you say?

292
00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:53.068
Yes, Paula?

293
00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:56.655
When your husband is in space,
does he ever see God?


294
00:16:56.755 --> 00:16:59.900
What about aliens?
Does he see aliens?


295
00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:02.995
Does he bring a laser gun
in case there are aliens?


296
00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:04.830
lf I were going,
I'd bring two laser guns--...


297
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.207
...a little one for my
pocket and a laser rifle.

298
00:17:07.307 --> 00:17:09.001
Does your husband have a laser rifle?

299
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:10.669
Does he get to
bring it home with him?

300
00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:13.922
Does it work here
on Earth or only in space?


301
00:17:14.022 --> 00:17:15.090
You know what, Calvin?

302
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.675
What, Mrs. Armacost?

303
00:17:16.775 --> 00:17:18.775
I'm going to miss you.

304
00:17:28.037 --> 00:17:31.331
And so I face

305
00:17:31.373 --> 00:17:34.668
The final curtain

306
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.296
My friends

307
00:17:37.337 --> 00:17:40.174
I must say it clear

308
00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:43.218
I'll state my case

309
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.638
Of which I'm certain

310
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.183
I've lived

311
00:17:49.224 --> 00:17:51.310
A life that's full

312
00:17:51.393 --> 00:17:54.188
I traveled each

313
00:17:54.229 --> 00:17:55.297
Ain't the world incredible?

314
00:17:55.397 --> 00:17:58.108
And every highway

315
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.861
And more

316
00:18:00.903 --> 00:18:03.864
Much more than this

317
00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:05.140
He did it

318
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.287
His way

319
00:18:27.763 --> 00:18:29.763
Thank you.

320
00:18:45.072 --> 00:18:47.741
To you, spaceman.

321
00:20:35.516 --> 00:20:37.516
Baby?

322
00:21:09.007 --> 00:21:10.659
I have a brief prepared statement...

323
00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:12.745
...and then there will be time for questions.

324
00:21:12.845 --> 00:21:16.790
Captain Alex Streck died
last night at eight fifty-five.


325
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.000
The cause of death...

326
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.336
...has been determined
to have been a massive stroke--...


327
00:21:20.436 --> 00:21:23.297
...what the surgeons are calling
a severe insult to the brain.


328
00:21:23.397 --> 00:21:25.299
Alex was an asset to this program...

329
00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:27.343
...way beyond his professional expertise.

330
00:21:27.443 --> 00:21:30.179
He will be missed
terribly by all of us.

331
00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:33.084
There will be a private ceremony.

332
00:21:34.032 --> 00:21:35.976
Is Commander Armacost in any danger?

333
00:21:36.076 --> 00:21:38.881
I'll let Dr. Patraba answer that.

334
00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:41.857
Commander Armacost has been through...

335
00:21:41.957 --> 00:21:44.693
...an intensive array
of examinations and tests.


336
00:21:44.793 --> 00:21:46.862
It is the opinion of myself
and my colleagues...


337
00:21:46.962 --> 00:21:50.872
...that he's in no more
danger than any of us.


338
00:22:07.232 --> 00:22:09.952
I'm going to be over here, baby.

339
00:22:10.778 --> 00:22:12.778
You OK?

340
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:14.848
Where's Natalie?

341
00:22:14.948 --> 00:22:17.309
She's in the back.
She's been asking for you.


342
00:22:17.409 --> 00:22:19.812
OK. I'll see you in a bit, OK?

343
00:22:19.912 --> 00:22:21.914
All right.
- OK.


344
00:22:52.194 --> 00:22:54.863
They talked to him every night.

345
00:22:56.407 --> 00:22:58.407
All the time.

346
00:23:01.537 --> 00:23:03.832
I couldn’t understand them.

347
00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:08.670
Who talked to him, Natalie?

348
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:15.549
They did.

349
00:23:18.262 --> 00:23:20.262
They did, Jillian.

350
00:24:02.097 --> 00:24:04.097
He's hiding inside me.

351
00:24:19.948 --> 00:24:22.268
I certainly do appreciate
your concern, Mr. Reese...


352
00:24:22.368 --> 00:24:25.688
...but I have been probed and poked
by enough needles...


353
00:24:25.788 --> 00:24:27.690
...and your superiors have given me
a clean bill of health.


354
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.276
I know that, but, Commander, I--

355
00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:32.027
It's probably nothing, but...

356
00:24:32.127 --> 00:24:35.527
Do your bosses know
you want to do this?

357
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:54.481
Oh, God.

358
00:25:21.135 --> 00:25:22.703
I'll be sure and let you know...

359
00:25:22.803 --> 00:25:24.705
...of some good places for you to shop.

360
00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:29.418
That dress is really sweet,
but it's not really appropriate.


361
00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:32.046
You'll meet lots of interesting
people when you're here.


362
00:25:32.146 --> 00:25:34.214
They like the sort of things I do.

363
00:25:34.314 --> 00:25:35.382
You can feel the first kick.

364
00:25:35.482 --> 00:25:38.761
Probably not quite as interesting as me...

365
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:40.596
...but you're very lucky.
I, uh...


366
00:25:40.696 --> 00:25:44.825
But then she saw
the rocket boosters come on...


367
00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:47.786
...and that's when you know...

368
00:25:47.828 --> 00:25:49.438
...that you're going somewhere real fast.

369
00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:51.440
Zoom, zoom, zoom.
- That's right.


370
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.535
I used to be into AIDS,
but now I'm into hunger.


371
00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:00.366
I teach.

372
00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:02.468
Oh, at the university?

373
00:26:03.594 --> 00:26:06.013
No, second grade.

374
00:26:06.055 --> 00:26:08.624
I'm sorry. I thought you said
you taught second grade.


375
00:26:08.724 --> 00:26:09.875
Yes. I--

376
00:26:09.975 --> 00:26:12.269
Oh, Ambrose, hi.

377
00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:13.587
You look great.

378
00:26:13.687 --> 00:26:14.922
Will you excuse me?

379
00:26:15.022 --> 00:26:17.022
Yeah, sure.

380
00:26:33.916 --> 00:26:35.359
Yeah, all right.

381
00:26:35.459 --> 00:26:37.459
Excuse me, Philip.

382
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.825
Now, don't worry about her.

383
00:26:42.925 --> 00:26:46.787
Total lack of body fat has made
her something less than human.


384
00:26:46.887 --> 00:26:49.248
I don't think she's had
her period in three years...


385
00:26:49.348 --> 00:26:50.666
...which I guess is a blessing...

386
00:26:50.766 --> 00:26:53.127
...for the gene pool,
wouldn’t you say?


387
00:26:53.227 --> 00:26:55.227
Shelly McLaren.

388
00:26:55.854 --> 00:26:57.854
Yeah, I know.

389
00:27:00.442 --> 00:27:01.510
Your husband must be--

390
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.262
Jackson McLaren.

391
00:27:03.362 --> 00:27:05.656
They all had cigars...

392
00:27:05.697 --> 00:27:08.809
...but Jackson had the biggest cigar of all.

393
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:10.909
Ah, here we go.

394
00:27:14.331 --> 00:27:17.401
Do you have many
friends here in the city?

395
00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:20.863
Yeah, some-- at work,
and Spencer, of course.


396
00:27:20.963 --> 00:27:23.853
What?
Your husband and your friend?


397
00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:27.161
Well, you better not let that get around.

398
00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:30.831
You know, they’re going
to haul you up on charges.


399
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:32.207
That, I like.

400
00:27:32.307 --> 00:27:33.375
What?

401
00:27:33.475 --> 00:27:34.543
Your laugh.

402
00:27:34.643 --> 00:27:37.104
That's an honest laugh.

403
00:27:37.146 --> 00:27:40.007
It's been a while since I've heard one.

404
00:27:40.107 --> 00:27:42.107
Thank you.

405
00:27:42.609 --> 00:27:44.261
It's all right.
I'll be right there.


406
00:27:44.361 --> 00:27:46.930
Apparently, there's some
minor disaster in the kitchen--...


407
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.849
...something to do with burning rum balls.

408
00:27:48.949 --> 00:27:50.517
I'm going to call you...

409
00:27:50.617 --> 00:27:53.854
...and we're going to go out
and laugh, all right?


410
00:27:53.954 --> 00:27:55.954
All right.

411
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:28.097
You all right?

412
00:28:28.197 --> 00:28:30.197
I'm drunk.

413
00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:34.284
Well, that’s good, honey.

414
00:28:38.582 --> 00:28:40.582
That's good.

415
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.515
Tell me what happened up there.

416
00:28:50.177 --> 00:28:52.177
Tell me.

417
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.400
All right.

418
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:09.111
Let's take a walk.

419
00:29:28.382 --> 00:29:31.017
You want to know what happened?

420
00:29:34.805 --> 00:29:36.805
Let me tell you.

421
00:29:42.354 --> 00:29:45.674
Do you want to know
about them two minutes?


422
00:29:45.774 --> 00:29:47.814
You never talk about it.

423
00:29:55.284 --> 00:29:57.284
Two minutes--...

424
00:29:58.203 --> 00:30:00.203
...dark...

425
00:30:00.706 --> 00:30:02.706
...black...

426
00:30:03.709 --> 00:30:05.709
...no light.

427
00:30:07.463 --> 00:30:09.757
There was an explosion...

428
00:30:09.798 --> 00:30:11.798
...and, um...

429
00:30:12.468 --> 00:30:14.508
...everything shut down.

430
00:30:15.262 --> 00:30:17.262
No light...

431
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:19.681
...no communication.

432
00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:22.309
It was black...

433
00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:24.311
...silent.

434
00:30:25.898 --> 00:30:27.900
No sound, but...

435
00:30:27.983 --> 00:30:30.177
...but loud-- something loud.

436
00:30:30.277 --> 00:30:32.277
Loud nothing.

437
00:30:32.613 --> 00:30:36.283
And it was cold.
It was so cold, Jill.


438
00:30:36.325 --> 00:30:39.328
And I knew what that cold was.

439
00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:42.788
It was death...

440
00:30:43.874 --> 00:30:46.902
...and it held me real tight
for about the first minute.


441
00:30:47.002 --> 00:30:49.002
And then...

442
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:53.131
I felt warmth.

443
00:30:53.717 --> 00:30:56.762
It was the warmth of your vagina...

444
00:30:56.845 --> 00:30:58.747
...the warmth of your body...

445
00:30:58.847 --> 00:31:00.847
...your hands...

446
00:31:02.101 --> 00:31:04.686
The inside of your mouth...

447
00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:07.089
...the warmth of your come...

448
00:31:07.189 --> 00:31:10.426
...the warmth from inside you,
Jillian--...


449
00:31:10.526 --> 00:31:12.526
...your warmth.

450
00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:17.282
I felt it all around me.

451
00:31:18.492 --> 00:31:20.492
It made me breathe.

452
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.960
It made me breathe.

453
00:32:38.447 --> 00:32:40.447
What's happening?

454
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:02.821
What are you doing?

455
00:34:04.992 --> 00:34:08.787
I couldn’t sleep,
so I was just...


456
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:11.081
Listening to some music.

457
00:34:32.978 --> 00:34:35.981
I'm sorry if I was a bit rough.

458
00:34:36.023 --> 00:34:39.933
I guess maybe I had
a little too much to drink.


459
00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:48.911
Come on, let’s go to bed.

460
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:07.721
Good night, sweetheart.

461
00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:49.121
'Then she began to guess
the little man's name.


462
00:35:49.221 --> 00:35:52.207
''Is it Conrad Peppermill?' she said...

463
00:35:52.307 --> 00:35:54.687
'And the little man said...'

464
00:35:57.354 --> 00:36:00.758
''I know, I know.
It's Sir William Doorknob...'


465
00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:03.238
'and the little man said...'

466
00:36:05.779 --> 00:36:07.181
''I have it.

467
00:36:07.281 --> 00:36:09.892
'It must be little Ribs of Beef...'

468
00:36:09.992 --> 00:36:12.372
'and the little man said...'

469
00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:19.109
''It couldn’t be
Rumple stilt skin, could it?''


470
00:36:19.209 --> 00:36:21.654
''What did you say?' said the little man.

471
00:36:21.754 --> 00:36:23.864
''I said it couldn’t be...''

472
00:36:23.964 --> 00:36:27.468
Rumple stilt skin!

473
00:36:27.509 --> 00:36:30.229
'And the little man screamed...'

474
00:36:30.763 --> 00:36:32.763
'and stamped his foot.'

475
00:36:44.318 --> 00:36:46.695
Honey, you sound so sad.

476
00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:48.777
It's just the city, Nan.

477
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.559
It just gets inside you,
that's all.


478
00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:54.228
You can't let it.

479
00:36:54.328 --> 00:36:56.772
That's how you got in trouble
after Mom and Dad died...


480
00:36:56.872 --> 00:37:00.334
...and you sound like you did then.

481
00:37:00.334 --> 00:37:04.046
Have you found a
doctor to talk to yet?

482
00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:06.088
Uh-uh.
Not yet.


483
00:37:07.257 --> 00:37:08.784
Promise me something, OK?

484
00:37:08.884 --> 00:37:11.804
lf it gets like it was before...

485
00:37:11.845 --> 00:37:15.160
...that you’ll find someone to talk to.

486
00:37:16.016 --> 00:37:18.481
Nan, I really have to go, OK?

487
00:37:22.606 --> 00:37:24.606
You're late.

488
00:37:25.192 --> 00:37:26.802
You didn't get my message?

489
00:37:26.902 --> 00:37:28.804
I had a dinner meeting tonight.

490
00:37:28.904 --> 00:37:30.723
No.
I didn't check the machine yet.


491
00:37:30.823 --> 00:37:33.117
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

492
00:37:33.158 --> 00:37:36.687
I still ain't conquered this corporate shit yet.

493
00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:39.677
I'm going to take a shower, honey.

494
00:38:42.394 --> 00:38:43.879
Do you ever think...

495
00:38:43.979 --> 00:38:46.173
...what if I had a F
-Fifteen in World War II...

496
00:38:46.273 --> 00:38:47.967
...or a B
-Seventeen in World War I?

497
00:38:48.067 --> 00:38:49.134
No, never.

498
00:38:49.234 --> 00:38:50.803
What kind of ass I could kick...

499
00:38:50.903 --> 00:38:52.346
...if I had that type of advanced technology?

500
00:38:52.446 --> 00:38:54.848
And how many different kinds
of ass are there?


501
00:38:54.948 --> 00:38:57.326
Many kinds, love...

502
00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.144
...but the modern battlefield
is all electronic...


503
00:38:59.244 --> 00:39:02.022
...and the fighter that this man
has helped us design...


504
00:39:02.122 --> 00:39:05.734
...can detect, sort, identify,
and eliminate...


505
00:39:05.834 --> 00:39:07.027
...anything electronic.

506
00:39:07.127 --> 00:39:08.821
You got two McLaren engines...

507
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:11.740
...pumping twenty-five thousand
pounds of thrust...


508
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.909
...wingspan of seventy-five feet.

509
00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:15.244
Fully extended.

510
00:39:15.344 --> 00:39:17.496
Oh, yeah, that's fully extended.

511
00:39:17.596 --> 00:39:19.915
You got a top speed of eighteen
hundred miles per hour...


512
00:39:20.015 --> 00:39:22.418
...a ceiling of fifty-five thousand feet...

513
00:39:22.518 --> 00:39:24.978
...and a crew of two.

514
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.673
The modern battlefield is a blizzard--...

515
00:39:27.773 --> 00:39:30.384
...a transparent,
electronic blizzard...


516
00:39:30.484 --> 00:39:32.344
...with planes and tanks...

517
00:39:32.444 --> 00:39:35.597
...and computers and missiles
all humming away--...


518
00:39:35.697 --> 00:39:38.976
...and into that storm flies our fighter.

519
00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.269
It doesn't drop bombs.

520
00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:42.062
It doesn't shoot missiles.

521
00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:44.457
It just sends out a signal.

522
00:39:44.832 --> 00:39:46.358
It's like the voice of God.

523
00:39:46.458 --> 00:39:49.445
It's just a signal that turns everything off.

524
00:39:49.545 --> 00:39:52.865
I forget, Jackson-- who is the enemy now...

525
00:39:52.965 --> 00:39:55.242
...that we need your
plane to defend us from?


526
00:39:55.342 --> 00:39:56.702
The enemy at this moment?

527
00:39:56.802 --> 00:39:59.221
You are, dear.
You are.


528
00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:04.585
The signal it makes--
what does it sound like?


529
00:40:04.685 --> 00:40:06.879
Oh, humans can't hear it, dove.

530
00:40:06.979 --> 00:40:09.773
Humans can't hear it at all.

531
00:40:09.815 --> 00:40:11.008
Excuse me, a moment.

532
00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.217
Miss Augusta would like to see you.

533
00:40:12.317 --> 00:40:13.802
Oh, all right.
Come on, Jackson.


534
00:40:13.902 --> 00:40:15.971
Augusta has summoned us to her bedside.

535
00:40:16.071 --> 00:40:17.723
It's the good-night kiss.

536
00:40:17.823 --> 00:40:19.391
After allowance...

537
00:40:19.491 --> 00:40:22.603
...it's the most important event of the day.

538
00:40:22.703 --> 00:40:24.229
The joys of parenthood.

539
00:40:24.329 --> 00:40:25.397
Come on, Jackson.

540
00:40:25.497 --> 00:40:27.497
Coming.

541
00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:51.690
Why are you so far away?

542
00:40:51.732 --> 00:40:53.732
I'm right here.

543
00:40:53.734 --> 00:40:55.903
What's the matter?

544
00:40:55.944 --> 00:40:57.388
What's wrong?

545
00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:00.282
I don't understand any of this.

546
00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:01.850
What they're talking about...

547
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.560
...it's like they're speaking in code.

548
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.380
Honey,
it's business, that’s all.


549
00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:09.483
Why do you have to build that plane?

550
00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:13.279
The way you talk about it,
it doesn't even sound like you.


551
00:41:13.379 --> 00:41:15.672
Baby, it's my job.

552
00:41:15.714 --> 00:41:17.714
My job.

553
00:41:18.467 --> 00:41:22.096
You used to say you'd fly forever.

554
00:41:22.137 --> 00:41:27.101
You used to say they'd have
to bury you in the sky.


555
00:41:27.142 --> 00:41:29.142
Yeah.
They almost did.


556
00:41:36.568 --> 00:41:39.722
What are you looking for
when you look at me like that?


557
00:41:39.822 --> 00:41:42.324
What are you hiding from me?

558
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:49.121
Nothing.

559
00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:14.189
This is going to be a little cold.

560
00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:21.405
Let's have a look in here,
shall we?


561
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.490
Ah, there it is.

562
00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:28.451
Let's take a measurement.

563
00:42:31.707 --> 00:42:35.502
Nine weeks,
give or take a few days.


564
00:42:35.502 --> 00:42:37.321
See this here?

565
00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.864
This flickering?

566
00:42:38.964 --> 00:42:40.032
What is that?

567
00:42:40.132 --> 00:42:42.132
That's the heartbeat.

568
00:42:46.013 --> 00:42:49.124
Is it supposed to be moving that fast?

569
00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:52.644
I would be worried if it were not.

570
00:42:52.686 --> 00:42:55.321
Everything looks fine, Jillian.

571
00:42:58.734 --> 00:43:00.859
Well, that’s interesting.

572
00:43:01.695 --> 00:43:03.695
What?

573
00:43:04.239 --> 00:43:06.279
Well, wait.
I'm not sure.


574
00:43:10.996 --> 00:43:12.998
See this here?

575
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.566
What is that?

576
00:43:14.666 --> 00:43:16.794
A second heartbeat.

577
00:43:16.835 --> 00:43:18.835
Two heartbeats.

578
00:43:20.381 --> 00:43:22.616
It's twins, Mrs. Armacost--...

579
00:43:22.716 --> 00:43:24.716
...twins.

580
00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:32.684
This is a number of a support group...

581
00:43:32.726 --> 00:43:35.871
...for women who are expecting twins.

582
00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:41.051
There's something I didn't tell you...

583
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:43.151
...for my chart.

584
00:43:44.029 --> 00:43:46.239
I know I should’ve, but...

585
00:43:47.366 --> 00:43:50.766
A few years ago,
after my parents died...


586
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.370
I...

587
00:43:56.417 --> 00:43:58.417
I had a bad time.

588
00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:01.586
How bad, Jillian?

589
00:44:04.466 --> 00:44:06.969
I would see people I knew...

590
00:44:09.263 --> 00:44:11.263
I would see them dead.

591
00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:14.268
And sometimes, I...

592
00:44:16.061 --> 00:44:18.061
I would see myself.

593
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.900
Did you seek treatment?

594
00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:27.529
Were you hospitalized?

595
00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:38.707
Does he know?

596
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.363
He's the one that got me through it.

597
00:44:42.463 --> 00:44:45.841
You are afraid...

598
00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.076
...that this pregnancy...

599
00:44:47.176 --> 00:44:50.746
...is going to bring all that back, right?

600
00:44:52.473 --> 00:44:54.516
Spend time with Spencer.

601
00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:56.043
Go through this together.

602
00:44:56.143 --> 00:44:57.503
Now that you know...

603
00:44:57.603 --> 00:44:59.505
...that all these feelings
you've been having...


604
00:44:59.605 --> 00:45:01.715
...are caused by the life growing in you...

605
00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:06.653
...and by your body adapting to it,
oh, cherish it.


606
00:45:07.696 --> 00:45:11.992
And if you need,
call me any time, day or night.


607
00:45:12.034 --> 00:45:14.034
Thank you.

608
00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.607
Just a nightmare, baby.

609
00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:49.620
You were talking in your sleep.

610
00:45:51.323 --> 00:45:52.474
What was I saying?

611
00:45:52.574 --> 00:45:54.827
Couldn’t tell.

612
00:45:54.868 --> 00:45:57.646
It didn't sound like words,
really.


613
00:45:57.746 --> 00:45:59.786
It was more like sounds.

614
00:46:00.582 --> 00:46:02.582
I'm scared.

615
00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:07.014
Well, I think it'd be strange...

616
00:46:08.048 --> 00:46:12.043
...if a first-time mother
wasn't scared, honey.


617
00:46:16.432 --> 00:46:18.475
Come on.
Come with me.


618
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:22.838
There you go.

619
00:46:22.938 --> 00:46:25.315
That's better, ain't it?

620
00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:36.637
Everything's going to be OK, isn't it?

621
00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:42.149
Everything's going to be just fine, honey.

622
00:46:42.249 --> 00:46:45.319
And they're going to be healthy, right?

623
00:46:45.419 --> 00:46:49.924
They're going to be beautiful,
just like their mother.


624
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.536
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?


625
00:46:54.636 --> 00:46:56.846
What are they going to be?

626
00:46:57.473 --> 00:47:00.125
Shit, they going to be pilots, honey.

627
00:47:00.225 --> 00:47:04.021
Just like their father.

628
00:47:05.272 --> 00:47:07.299
All right, lean back here.

629
00:47:07.399 --> 00:47:09.401
Let me wash your hair.

630
00:47:17.993 --> 00:47:19.993
Am I dreaming, Spencer?

631
00:47:27.086 --> 00:47:29.126
No, you’re not dreaming.

632
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.410
And then he gives you that look--...

633
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:37.971
...that 'honey, 
I understand' look.

634
00:47:38.013 --> 00:47:39.748
I don't care how long
he rubs my feet for.

635
00:47:39.848 --> 00:47:42.398
He doesn't understand a thing.

636
00:47:42.434 --> 00:47:43.544
He rubs your feet?

637
00:47:43.644 --> 00:47:46.647
I know what you mean.

638
00:47:46.688 --> 00:47:48.882
We're supposed to be going
through this together...


639
00:47:48.982 --> 00:47:51.927
...but I have never felt
more separate from him.


640
00:47:52.027 --> 00:47:53.846
It's like there's something
going on in my body...


641
00:47:53.946 --> 00:47:56.448
...he knows nothing about.

642
00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.490
He rubs your feet?

643
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.560
I get into the
bathtub with my socks on.

644
00:49:25.204 --> 00:49:27.204
Aah!
Oh, my God!


645
00:49:28.749 --> 00:49:30.959
Jesus, you scared me.

646
00:49:35.547 --> 00:49:37.883
You are in big trouble.

647
00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:41.343
Do you like the pie?

648
00:49:41.762 --> 00:49:44.290
I don't believe I can take
much more of this, honey.


649
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.855
How much do you like the pie?

650
00:49:48.977 --> 00:49:50.129
Come get the pie.

651
00:49:50.229 --> 00:49:53.424
First, I'm going to drink you,
then I'm going to eat you.


652
00:49:53.524 --> 00:49:54.591
Get the pie.

653
00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:57.156
I'm going to eat that, right?

654
00:49:58.112 --> 00:50:00.723
Think you can handle all three of us?

655
00:50:00.823 --> 00:50:01.890
Do you love the belly?

656
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.058
I love it.

657
00:50:03.158 --> 00:50:06.133
Good, 'cause I love the belly, too.

658
00:50:13.419 --> 00:50:15.419
Excuse me.

659
00:50:26.181 --> 00:50:29.977
Do you remember me?

660
00:50:41.947 --> 00:50:44.412
How many months?
- Just a few.


661
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.325
I need to speak with you.

662
00:50:47.536 --> 00:50:50.564
Spencer works for McLaren now,
if you're looking for him.


663
00:50:50.664 --> 00:50:55.169
No, I need to speak with you,
Mrs. Armacost...


664
00:50:57.504 --> 00:50:59.573
...about those two minutes.

665
00:50:59.673 --> 00:51:02.760
The two minutes, Mrs. Armacost.

666
00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:04.970
What is it, Mr. Reese?

667
00:51:05.012 --> 00:51:08.248
Have you noticed any change
in your husband's behavior...


668
00:51:08.348 --> 00:51:09.541
...since the shuttle mission?

669
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:13.045
I've been through these files,
and there are peculiarities.


670
00:51:13.145 --> 00:51:14.254
Like right here.

671
00:51:14.354 --> 00:51:15.798
This is your husband's signature...

672
00:51:15.898 --> 00:51:17.466
...before he went on the shuttle
that last time...


673
00:51:17.566 --> 00:51:19.426
...and here's a form
that he signed when he returned.


674
00:51:19.526 --> 00:51:23.530
Now, they are similar,
but not the same.


675
00:51:23.572 --> 00:51:25.572
Not the same signature.

676
00:51:25.574 --> 00:51:29.144
Mr. Reese, are you in New York
on official NASA business?


677
00:51:29.244 --> 00:51:31.272
And here's the results
of the medical tests...


678
00:51:31.372 --> 00:51:34.092
...that we ran when he got back.

679
00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:37.611
Are you on official NASA business?

680
00:51:37.711 --> 00:51:38.988
Everything is fine.

681
00:51:39.088 --> 00:51:40.614
Everything shows up normal...

682
00:51:40.714 --> 00:51:42.783
...but everything's just a
little bit different--...


683
00:51:42.883 --> 00:51:44.118
...blood levels...

684
00:51:44.218 --> 00:51:45.828
...temperature, EKG, EEG.

685
00:51:45.928 --> 00:51:50.433
Everything's just a little off
from what it was. Look.


686
00:51:50.849 --> 00:51:53.144
Does NASA know you're here?

687
00:51:54.937 --> 00:51:56.422
They wouldn’t listen.

688
00:51:56.522 --> 00:51:59.316
They terminated my employment.

689
00:52:03.445 --> 00:52:05.445
I have to go now.

690
00:52:05.447 --> 00:52:10.661
lf you have anything to say,
call my husband at McLaren.


691
00:52:10.703 --> 00:52:13.272
I showed them the facts, and
they terminated my employment.


692
00:52:13.372 --> 00:52:15.482
They referred me to a psychiatrist.

693
00:52:15.582 --> 00:52:17.582
Don’t follow me.

694
00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.821
I've seen Captain Streck's autopsy report.

695
00:52:20.921 --> 00:52:22.948
It was a massive stroke.
His system overloaded.


696
00:52:23.048 --> 00:52:24.700
His body couldn’t stand the strain.

697
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.965
I've seen Natalie Streck's
autopsy report as well.


698
00:52:30.431 --> 00:52:32.583
That was a suicide.
She killed herself.


699
00:52:32.683 --> 00:52:33.751
I was there.
I saw it.


700
00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:35.836
Yeah, she did,
but according to the report...


701
00:52:35.936 --> 00:52:39.840
...when she killed herself,
she was three weeks pregnant.


702
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:41.133
What did you say?

703
00:52:41.233 --> 00:52:42.384
She probably conceived...

704
00:52:42.484 --> 00:52:43.802
...right after her husband left the hospital.

705
00:52:43.902 --> 00:52:46.622
She was pregnant, Mrs. Armacost.

706
00:52:46.947 --> 00:52:49.016
What happened during those two minutes...

707
00:52:49.116 --> 00:52:50.684
...when they were alone?

708
00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:52.853
The suits that your husband
and Captain Streck wore...


709
00:52:52.953 --> 00:52:55.189
...had built-in recorders.
Listen to the voices.


710
00:52:55.289 --> 00:52:57.566
Something happened that scared
the shit out of them.


711
00:52:57.666 --> 00:52:59.360
What could do that?

712
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.696
No. It was an accident.
There was an explosion, and--


713
00:53:02.796 --> 00:53:04.740
No!
They trained for explosions.


714
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.075
They trained for accidents.

715
00:53:06.175 --> 00:53:07.242
They trained for hundreds of hours.

716
00:53:07.342 --> 00:53:08.786
lf something goes wrong,
they have a plan.


717
00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:10.412
They don't panic.
They don't deviate.


718
00:53:10.512 --> 00:53:12.206
They stick to the plan.
That's what they do.


719
00:53:12.306 --> 00:53:13.707
Something happened out there...

720
00:53:13.807 --> 00:53:16.543
...that these two men had not trained for.

721
00:53:16.643 --> 00:53:19.421
What would do that to two
highly-trained astronauts?


722
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:20.881
Scare them like that?

723
00:53:20.981 --> 00:53:25.061
Can you swear to me
that he's still your husband?


724
00:53:25.319 --> 00:53:28.155
Let go of me, Mr. Reese.

725
00:53:28.197 --> 00:53:30.407
Is this man bothering you?

726
00:53:33.952 --> 00:53:35.062
Yes, he is.

727
00:53:35.162 --> 00:53:39.208
You know, don't you?
You already know.


728
00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:41.527
Room three-oh-four, Nesbit Arms,
Mrs. Armacost.


729
00:53:41.627 --> 00:53:43.627
Please, Mrs. Armacost!

730
00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:48.509
OK. Settle down.
Just settle down.


731
00:53:51.887 --> 00:53:54.456
I'm going to rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees.


732
00:53:54.556 --> 00:53:56.000
You got me, Alex?

733
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.251
Spencer, what is that?

734
00:53:57.351 --> 00:53:58.919
Did you feel that?

735
00:53:59.019 --> 00:54:01.019
Spencer, what is that?

736
00:54:04.358 --> 00:54:07.758
Oh, Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?!


737
00:54:43.522 --> 00:54:47.177
I'm looking for the pregnant woman in 24
-F.

738
00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.486
Jillian, what’s wrong?

739
00:54:52.865 --> 00:54:55.809
He said she must have
gotten pregnant right...


740
00:54:55.909 --> 00:54:57.811
...right after Alex got back.

741
00:54:57.911 --> 00:54:59.605
Did he say anything else?

742
00:54:59.705 --> 00:55:02.416
Oh, God, Nan.

743
00:55:02.416 --> 00:55:06.111
The last thing you need
to worry about is that freak.


744
00:55:06.211 --> 00:55:07.988
Just have Spencer call someone.

745
00:55:08.088 --> 00:55:10.088
No, Nan.

746
00:55:11.592 --> 00:55:13.661
Spencer can't know about this.

747
00:55:13.761 --> 00:55:15.829
But, Jillian,
you said he looked crazy.


748
00:55:15.929 --> 00:55:21.602
You have to promise me
you won't tell Spencer.


749
00:55:21.602 --> 00:55:22.962
Please promise me.

750
00:55:23.062 --> 00:55:27.737
You can't keep these things
bottled inside you, Jillian.


751
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:30.611
You're right.

752
00:55:35.866 --> 00:55:38.827
lf he bothers me again...

753
00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:42.915
I'll tell Spencer, OK?
Deal?


754
00:55:48.295 --> 00:55:50.030
Your table’s ready.

755
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:53.445
Oh, great. All right.
Let's go sit down.


756
00:55:55.761 --> 00:55:59.415
Stan? This year's grand marshal
at the parade of losers?


757
00:55:59.515 --> 00:56:00.666
He's gone.

758
00:56:00.766 --> 00:56:03.377
We can't all be
as lucky as Jill here.

759
00:56:03.477 --> 00:56:05.857
Oh, no.
It's me that's lucky.


760
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:14.466
You all right, honey?
What's the matter?


761
00:56:16.031 --> 00:56:17.266
What's the matter, honey?

762
00:56:17.366 --> 00:56:18.434
You all right?

763
00:56:18.534 --> 00:56:20.744
Just a little hot.

764
00:56:22.496 --> 00:56:25.249
Why don't you have some water?

765
00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:30.879
I think I'm gonna go home.

766
00:56:41.682 --> 00:56:44.852
All right.

767
00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:18.633
Feeling better?

768
00:57:26.018 --> 00:57:27.086
Where's Nan?

769
00:57:27.186 --> 00:57:28.879
She went out.

770
00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:32.066
It's after midnight.

771
00:57:32.107 --> 00:57:34.969
She's young, Jill.
She's having fun.


772
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:39.948
Don't you remember
when we used to have fun?


773
00:57:47.331 --> 00:57:49.796
You don't remember that, huh?

774
00:57:54.546 --> 00:57:57.257
All right.

775
00:57:57.299 --> 00:57:58.701
What's wrong with you?

776
00:57:58.801 --> 00:58:01.829
You ever think about
what happened to Alex?


777
00:58:01.929 --> 00:58:04.056
Oh, shit.

778
00:58:04.098 --> 00:58:06.223
What happened to Natalie?

779
00:58:09.937 --> 00:58:11.937
I do, all the time.

780
00:58:13.107 --> 00:58:16.337
Those two minutes you could have died.

781
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.864
Why do you want to go back there?

782
00:58:20.906 --> 00:58:23.881
Why do you want
to go back to that?

783
00:58:25.077 --> 00:58:29.327
Can't you just try for once
to be happy? Just once?


784
00:58:44.638 --> 00:58:47.975
I'm gonna go to sleep.

785
00:59:08.203 --> 00:59:10.289
It's Jillian Armacost.

786
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:13.542
The autopsy on Natalie Streck...

787
00:59:13.584 --> 00:59:16.474
...what did it say about the baby?

788
00:59:19.006 --> 00:59:20.950
Not on the phone,
Mrs. Armacost.


789
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:23.953
No, you don't understand.
You have to tell me.


790
00:59:24.053 --> 00:59:27.122
What did Natalie’s autopsy
say about the baby?


791
00:59:27.222 --> 00:59:29.222
Babies.

792
00:59:32.478 --> 00:59:33.921
What?

793
00:59:34.021 --> 00:59:38.526
Natalie Streck was pregnant
with twins, Mrs. Armacost.


794
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.570
Oh, my God.

795
00:59:45.532 --> 00:59:47.226
What's happening to me?

796
00:59:47.326 --> 00:59:49.953
You are, too, aren't you?

797
00:59:52.456 --> 00:59:54.496
Pregnant with his twins?

798
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.210
Natalie’s babies...

799
01:00:02.716 --> 01:00:05.077
What did the autopsy say about them?

800
01:00:05.177 --> 01:00:07.037
There's something I...

801
01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.373
I need to show you,
Mrs. Armacost.


802
01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:11.083
Something you need to see.

803
01:00:11.183 --> 01:00:15.396
Do you know the story of the princess...

804
01:00:15.396 --> 01:00:18.816
...whose beloved prince dies in battle?

805
01:00:18.857 --> 01:00:24.071
Mrs. Armacost, I have something
you need to see.


806
01:00:24.071 --> 01:00:26.071
Do you understand me?

807
01:00:30.911 --> 01:00:32.911
The enemy prince...

808
01:00:34.456 --> 01:00:37.346
...after overrunning the castle...

809
01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:43.424
...finds the princess
and forces himself upon her.


810
01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.222
Months later,
the princess is with child.


811
01:00:50.264 --> 01:00:53.183
But whose?

812
01:00:56.687 --> 01:01:01.066
It's either the child of her enemy...

813
01:01:01.108 --> 01:01:04.253
...the man that killed her husband...

814
01:01:05.154 --> 01:01:07.865
...the man that raped her...

815
01:01:10.909 --> 01:01:15.414
...in which case, she'll kill
herself and the child...


816
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:20.895
...or it's the child of her prince...

817
01:01:23.297 --> 01:01:26.697
...the only thing she has left of him...

818
01:01:27.342 --> 01:01:31.597
...a part of him still alive within her...

819
01:01:32.681 --> 01:01:34.891
...kept safe inside her...

820
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.270
...in which case...

821
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:47.071
But how would she know
until it was too late?


822
01:01:50.532 --> 01:01:52.184
How will she know...

823
01:01:52.284 --> 01:01:56.619
...until the child is born
and she can see its eyes?


824
01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:02.002
Meet me right now.

825
01:02:02.044 --> 01:02:03.612
Somewhere public.

826
01:02:03.712 --> 01:02:06.517
Leave your apartment.
Meet me now.


827
01:02:39.415 --> 01:02:41.458
I thought that was you.

828
01:02:43.377 --> 01:02:46.030
I was standing over there
across the street...


829
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:50.284
...and I said to myself,
'Now, is that Sherman Reese?'


830
01:02:50.384 --> 01:02:51.827
Nice to see you.

831
01:02:51.927 --> 01:02:53.078
Commander Armacost.

832
01:02:53.178 --> 01:02:55.831
Yeah. Are you in town on official business?

833
01:02:55.931 --> 01:03:00.352
I'm not with NASA anymore.

834
01:03:00.394 --> 01:03:01.629
You know what?

835
01:03:01.729 --> 01:03:04.024
You know what?
I heard that.


836
01:03:04.064 --> 01:03:05.841
I heard that, and I thought...

837
01:03:05.941 --> 01:03:09.053
...it was one of them nasty agency rumors.

838
01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:10.429
Well, listen...

839
01:03:10.529 --> 01:03:13.807
...if you need a recommendation,
don't hesitate...


840
01:03:13.907 --> 01:03:15.309
...because maybe I can help you out.

841
01:03:15.409 --> 01:03:17.870
Well, I appreciate that.

842
01:03:18.912 --> 01:03:22.124
It's real weird running into you...

843
01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:25.986
'cause the thing of it is,
I was just thinking about you.


844
01:03:26.086 --> 01:03:29.865
I was thinking about them tests
you wanted to run on me...


845
01:03:29.965 --> 01:03:31.617
...you know, after Alex died.

846
01:03:31.717 --> 01:03:33.369
lf you got a
couple of minutes right now...

847
01:03:33.469 --> 01:03:35.663
...we can go down, have a cup
of coffee or something.


848
01:03:35.763 --> 01:03:37.289
Actually, I got to--

849
01:03:37.389 --> 01:03:39.166
Oh, no, come on, now, Sherman.

850
01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:41.001
You're a man of leisure.

851
01:03:41.101 --> 01:03:44.046
You ain't got nothing but time,
do you?


852
01:03:44.146 --> 01:03:46.440
Come on.

853
01:03:47.608 --> 01:03:49.903
Yeah, it's nice to see you.

854
01:04:04.792 --> 01:04:08.587
Almost forgot your satchel,
Mr. Reese.


855
01:04:08.629 --> 01:04:10.629
I got it.

856
01:04:41.495 --> 01:04:43.814
You were the only one who knew, Nan.

857
01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:45.858
I asked you not to tell him.

858
01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:47.958
I didn't, OK?

859
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.362
What were you talking about
last night when I was sleeping?


860
01:04:50.462 --> 01:04:52.406
We were just talking.
- About what?


861
01:04:52.506 --> 01:04:53.574
Just talking, Jillian.

862
01:04:53.674 --> 01:04:56.535
Look, don't do this.
It's not good for you.


863
01:04:56.635 --> 01:04:58.287
Where did you go last night?

864
01:04:58.387 --> 01:04:59.580
Will you listen to yourself?

865
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.748
Where did you go?!

866
01:05:00.848 --> 01:05:02.374
Look, Jillian, I love you, OK?

867
01:05:02.474 --> 01:05:05.044
And Spencer loves you.
We all do so much.


868
01:05:05.144 --> 01:05:08.147
Spencer was there.

869
01:05:08.188 --> 01:05:11.775
Nan, Spencer was there with Reese...

870
01:05:11.817 --> 01:05:14.720
...and you were the
only one who knew, Nan.


871
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.306
How did he know unless you told him?!

872
01:05:17.406 --> 01:05:19.491
You promised me!

873
01:05:21.326 --> 01:05:22.561
Jillian, I love you...

874
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:26.146
...but I'm not going
to do this with you.

875
01:05:30.544 --> 01:05:33.589
Do what with me?

876
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:34.740
Come back, Nan.

877
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.509
Nan, come back!

878
01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:40.969
Don't leave, Nan!

879
01:05:45.267 --> 01:05:47.269
Shit!

880
01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:11.026
Hello. Nesbit Arms.

881
01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:14.129
Mr. Reese in room three-oh-four.

882
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:27.831
There's no answer in room three-oh-four.

883
01:06:30.104 --> 01:06:32.815
Down came the rain

884
01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:36.485
And washed the spider out

885
01:06:36.527 --> 01:06:38.904
Out came the sun

886
01:06:38.946 --> 01:06:42.491
And dried up all the rain

887
01:06:42.533 --> 01:06:45.786
And the itsy-bitsy spider

888
01:06:45.828 --> 01:06:48.580
Climbed up the spout again

889
01:09:02.923 --> 01:09:04.923
Oh, God.

890
01:09:25.821 --> 01:09:27.821
Are you OK?

891
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:42.071
It's like a joke, right?

892
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:45.032
But if you are watching this tape...

893
01:09:45.132 --> 01:09:47.760
I didn't get to that meeting.

894
01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:50.329
lf you are watching this tape,
Mrs. Armacost...


895
01:09:50.429 --> 01:09:51.664
I'm probably fucking dead!

896
01:09:51.764 --> 01:09:54.099
This is my backup.

897
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:57.116
That's what they taught us at NASA.

898
01:09:57.144 --> 01:10:00.105
Always have a backup system.

899
01:10:00.147 --> 01:10:03.776
I'm not crazy.
I wish I was.


900
01:10:03.817 --> 01:10:08.113
I prayed I was.
I know I'm not.


901
01:10:08.155 --> 01:10:10.620
You might think you're crazy.

902
01:10:11.742 --> 01:10:13.742
How could you not?

903
01:10:17.539 --> 01:10:21.085
Always have a backup.

904
01:10:21.126 --> 01:10:23.904
You're going to hear
two voices on this tape.


905
01:10:24.004 --> 01:10:28.342
One is your husband's
and the other Captain Streck.


906
01:10:28.342 --> 01:10:31.620
I'm gonna rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees...


907
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.498
This line is your husband's voice.

908
01:10:34.598 --> 01:10:36.417
This line is Captain Streck's.

909
01:10:36.517 --> 01:10:37.918
Spencer, what is that?

910
01:10:38.018 --> 01:10:39.545
What the fuck--

911
01:10:39.645 --> 01:10:42.047
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?!


912
01:10:42.147 --> 01:10:44.091
Two voices, but three lines.

913
01:10:44.191 --> 01:10:46.176
There's something else on the tape.

914
01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:49.471
Something beyond our range of hearing...

915
01:10:49.571 --> 01:10:51.571
...but I translated it.

916
01:10:51.573 --> 01:10:53.659
I had to hear it...

917
01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:55.828
...and this...

918
01:10:57.871 --> 01:11:00.165
...is what it sounds like.

919
01:11:10.718 --> 01:11:12.953
NASA said that it's static...

920
01:11:13.053 --> 01:11:14.246
It's not static.

921
01:11:14.346 --> 01:11:15.998
...caused by the explosion of the satellite...

922
01:11:16.098 --> 01:11:19.043
...static buildup in their suits,
but it's not static.


923
01:11:19.143 --> 01:11:20.753
I tracked it.
It is not static.


924
01:11:20.853 --> 01:11:21.962
Not static.

925
01:11:22.062 --> 01:11:26.482
It's not from their suits,
the satellite, or shuttle.


926
01:11:27.276 --> 01:11:29.862
It's not from Earth, either.

927
01:11:32.448 --> 01:11:35.017
Two minutes-- that's all
there is. That's all it took.


928
01:11:35.117 --> 01:11:39.747
lf you wanted to come here
from very, very far away...


929
01:11:39.788 --> 01:11:43.025
...maybe you wouldn’t
have to travel in a ship.


930
01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:45.152
Maybe you could travel in a transmission...

931
01:11:45.252 --> 01:11:48.530
...at the speed of light,
like a thought.


932
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.008
Just wait...

933
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:53.770
...for two of us to be up there.

934
01:11:54.928 --> 01:11:56.538
Two of us...

935
01:11:56.638 --> 01:11:58.707
...in orbit, near a target.

936
01:11:58.807 --> 01:12:00.668
Something to aim at,
like the satellite.


937
01:12:00.768 --> 01:12:03.979
Two of us beyond suspicion.

938
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:06.106
Heroes, all
-Americans.

939
01:12:06.148 --> 01:12:09.526
Wait for them...

940
01:12:09.568 --> 01:12:15.115
...then erase them like a tape
and record your own message.


941
01:12:16.784 --> 01:12:19.661
He's not your husband anymore.

942
01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:21.063
He's not.

943
01:12:21.163 --> 01:12:23.163
What?

944
01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:25.484
The computer that runs this airplane--...

945
01:12:25.584 --> 01:12:27.194
...it's not there.
It hasn't been designed yet...


946
01:12:27.294 --> 01:12:30.364
...but it's supposed to go...
right here in the cockpit...


947
01:12:30.464 --> 01:12:34.289
...right where the pilots are supposed to be.

948
01:12:37.012 --> 01:12:41.100
Two computers that work off each other...

949
01:12:41.141 --> 01:12:44.103
...that feed off each other.

950
01:12:44.144 --> 01:12:46.271
Twins.

951
01:12:46.313 --> 01:12:48.313
Twin computers.

952
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:51.944
Twins, Mrs. Armacost.

953
01:12:51.985 --> 01:12:54.930
What do you think
you have inside of you?

954
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:58.325
What do you think he put there?

955
01:12:58.325 --> 01:13:00.019
What are they going to be?

956
01:13:00.119 --> 01:13:02.187
They going to be pilots, honey.

957
01:13:02.287 --> 01:13:04.998
Just like their father.

958
01:13:15.342 --> 01:13:17.328
What's the matter?
Did I scare you?


959
01:13:17.428 --> 01:13:19.638
I didn't hear you come in.

960
01:13:21.265 --> 01:13:24.101
Listen, I came home, 'cause...

961
01:13:24.143 --> 01:13:27.838
I felt bad for you.
That fight with Nan, you know.


962
01:13:27.938 --> 01:13:30.758
Why don't tell me what it was about?

963
01:13:30.858 --> 01:13:32.860
Just sister stuff.

964
01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.900
Have you heard from her?

965
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.867
Well...

966
01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:42.033
I'm sure she'll call you.

967
01:13:45.414 --> 01:13:47.414
You're trembling.

968
01:13:49.877 --> 01:13:51.877
I am?

969
01:13:54.089 --> 01:13:56.089
I'm a little cold.

970
01:13:59.678 --> 01:14:01.288
You know what I did?

971
01:14:01.388 --> 01:14:06.435
I brought something home
I believe's gonna cheer you up.


972
01:14:06.477 --> 01:14:08.477
What do you think?

973
01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:10.812
Pop it in.

974
01:14:17.196 --> 01:14:20.115
Were you watching something?

975
01:14:23.952 --> 01:14:28.040
It's a-- it's a pregnancy video.

976
01:14:32.086 --> 01:14:35.486
Well, maybe we should watch it together.

977
01:14:40.552 --> 01:14:42.288
Let's watch the movie.

978
01:14:42.388 --> 01:14:44.681
You sure?

979
01:14:47.226 --> 01:14:50.062
All right.

980
01:14:51.897 --> 01:14:54.341
Why are you building that plane?

981
01:14:54.441 --> 01:14:56.443
What's that?

982
01:14:56.485 --> 01:14:58.012
Why do you have to build that plane?

983
01:14:58.112 --> 01:15:00.823
It's a contract, Jill.

984
01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.016
And besides...

985
01:15:02.116 --> 01:15:05.603
I didn't add half as much
as Jackson said I did.


986
01:15:05.703 --> 01:15:08.772
They got some real sharp
engineers over there.


987
01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:10.997
Come here.
Mmm, back here.


988
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:14.710
Come on.

989
01:15:25.848 --> 01:15:28.228
I know what you're thinking.

990
01:15:30.394 --> 01:15:31.920
Don't you worry.

991
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.899
Everything's gonna be just fine.

992
01:16:25.074 --> 01:16:27.685
Yeah, these pesky goddamn satellites.

993
01:16:27.785 --> 01:16:29.478
I'm gonna rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees.


994
01:16:29.578 --> 01:16:30.938
You got me AIex?

995
01:16:31.038 --> 01:16:34.108
Spencer, what is that?
Did you feel that?


996
01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:35.734
Spencer, what is that?

997
01:16:35.834 --> 01:16:36.902
What the fuck--

998
01:16:37.002 --> 01:16:40.062
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?!


999
01:16:57.064 --> 01:16:59.064
Must have dozed off.

1000
01:17:00.734 --> 01:17:02.734
Were you dreaming?

1001
01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:07.531
No. Just sleeping.

1002
01:17:09.159 --> 01:17:11.159
You weren't dreaming?

1003
01:17:14.707 --> 01:17:16.707
I wasn't dreamin'.

1004
01:17:20.796 --> 01:17:22.796
Were you?

1005
01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.079
My caterer gets them
from the French Caribbean.


1006
01:17:29.179 --> 01:17:33.259
The French are so much more
advanced in this way.


1007
01:17:36.228 --> 01:17:37.630
Now, listen, with these...

1008
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:40.733
...all sales are final.

1009
01:17:40.774 --> 01:17:44.429
Are you sure this is the way
you want to go?


1010
01:17:55.789 --> 01:17:57.358
Now, when you get home...

1011
01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:59.735
...you take both pills
and then go to bed.

1012
01:17:59.835 --> 01:18:02.237
It's gonna be quite
a bit of vile crampin'...

1013
01:18:02.337 --> 01:18:03.781
...but as soon as you start spottin'...

1014
01:18:03.881 --> 01:18:05.366
...it goes real fast.

1015
01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.801
And Spencer won't know?

1016
01:18:07.801 --> 01:18:09.328
lf he's anything like the rest...

1017
01:18:09.428 --> 01:18:10.913
...he'll think you had a miscarriage...

1018
01:18:11.013 --> 01:18:14.668
...and he'll go out
and buy you a bracelet.

1019
01:18:20.773 --> 01:18:24.009
Now, don't beat yourself up
about this, sweetheart.


1020
01:18:24.109 --> 01:18:29.448
I mean, it's not as if
any of this means anything.


1021
01:18:37.956 --> 01:18:40.626
There's a little bit of pain...

1022
01:18:40.667 --> 01:18:43.504
...and then it's over.

1023
01:18:46.382 --> 01:18:47.533
Oh, God.

1024
01:18:47.633 --> 01:18:49.676
I can't.

1025
01:18:49.718 --> 01:18:51.804
Oh, God.

1026
01:18:51.845 --> 01:18:54.681
I can't do it.

1027
01:18:54.723 --> 01:18:57.810
It's gonna be really bad.

1028
01:19:02.147 --> 01:19:04.274
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:19:04.316 --> 01:19:07.945
You'll understand.

1030
01:19:07.986 --> 01:19:09.986
I have to.

1031
01:19:12.032 --> 01:19:14.032
Wait.

1032
01:19:14.368 --> 01:19:16.368
Just...

1033
01:19:17.246 --> 01:19:18.981
...a little pain.

1034
01:19:19.081 --> 01:19:20.941
Just...

1035
01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:23.544
And then it's over.

1036
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:33.887
They're just babies.

1037
01:19:33.929 --> 01:19:35.164
I can't do it.

1038
01:19:35.264 --> 01:19:36.665
Oh, God.

1039
01:19:36.765 --> 01:19:38.765
I can't do it.

1040
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.060
Oh, help me!

1041
01:19:43.564 --> 01:19:46.316
No. Don't do that.

1042
01:19:54.324 --> 01:19:55.768
Oh, God, stop it.

1043
01:19:55.868 --> 01:19:58.037
He's gonna...

1044
01:20:02.499 --> 01:20:04.624
They're just-- they're...

1045
01:20:11.091 --> 01:20:13.177
Oh, God, no.

1046
01:20:14.678 --> 01:20:17.228
What were you gonna do to 'em?

1047
01:20:22.227 --> 01:20:25.064
No, you heard them.
Oh, God.


1048
01:20:25.105 --> 01:20:27.145
What were you gonna do?!

1049
01:20:29.068 --> 01:20:31.068
Nothing.

1050
01:20:51.965 --> 01:20:54.843
Jill...please.

1051
01:20:56.637 --> 01:21:00.557
Let's just calm down
and talk about this, OK?


1052
01:21:07.314 --> 01:21:09.314
Come on, now, honey.

1053
01:21:17.825 --> 01:21:19.950
Where you gonna go, Jill?

1054
01:22:27.061 --> 01:22:28.504
Don't talk.

1055
01:22:28.604 --> 01:22:31.482
Don't say a word, honey.

1056
01:22:31.523 --> 01:22:34.068
You're fine.
You're fine now.


1057
01:22:37.821 --> 01:22:39.431
They're still inside you, Jill.

1058
01:22:39.531 --> 01:22:42.476
They're right where they need to be...

1059
01:22:42.576 --> 01:22:46.855
...and we're not ever gonna mention
what you tried to do...


1060
01:22:46.955 --> 01:22:49.358
...what you tried to
do with them pills, OK?

1061
01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:51.710
Doesn't exist.

1062
01:22:51.752 --> 01:22:53.792
Never happened, Jillian.

1063
01:22:55.631 --> 01:23:00.094
I don't want to hear
a peep out of you.

1064
01:23:00.135 --> 01:23:03.472
You hear me?

1065
01:23:03.514 --> 01:23:05.724
I love you so much.

1066
01:23:05.766 --> 01:23:07.710
I don't know what I'd do...

1067
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:11.588
...if anything ever happened
to you or the babies.


1068
01:23:11.688 --> 01:23:16.527
Now, you just keep quiet,
and you rest.


1069
01:23:16.568 --> 01:23:18.568
I'm here with you.

1070
01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:24.284
I'm always gonna be here,
Jill, always.


1071
01:23:28.664 --> 01:23:30.664
You sleep.

1072
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.750
Good girl.

1073
01:23:57.151 --> 01:23:59.887
I don't want to fight with you, Jilly.

1074
01:23:59.987 --> 01:24:02.906
There's something wrong, Nan.

1075
01:24:02.948 --> 01:24:04.558
There's not.

1076
01:24:04.658 --> 01:24:06.518
Doctor says you can go home any day.

1077
01:24:06.618 --> 01:24:09.705
No. Something's wrong...

1078
01:24:09.747 --> 01:24:11.273
...with Spencer...

1079
01:24:11.373 --> 01:24:12.733
...and the twins.

1080
01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:14.401
Hey, it's just this place.

1081
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.630
No.
He did something to me, Nan...


1082
01:24:18.672 --> 01:24:21.341
...and I didn't tell you.

1083
01:24:22.509 --> 01:24:24.745
Jillian, it's just being in the hospital...

1084
01:24:24.845 --> 01:24:26.747
...that makes you feel this way.

1085
01:24:26.847 --> 01:24:29.249
I know that you hate it here...

1086
01:24:29.349 --> 01:24:31.335
...but we're gonna take you home soon...

1087
01:24:31.435 --> 01:24:33.754
...and we're all gonna take care of you.

1088
01:24:33.854 --> 01:24:34.964
You?

1089
01:24:35.064 --> 01:24:36.590
Yeah, of course me.

1090
01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:38.690
Me, Spencer, all of us.

1091
01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:42.110
Oh, God.

1092
01:24:43.363 --> 01:24:44.932
I'm so scared.

1093
01:24:45.032 --> 01:24:48.410
Something horrible is happening...

1094
01:24:48.452 --> 01:24:49.728
...to me...

1095
01:24:49.828 --> 01:24:51.105
...and the babies.

1096
01:24:51.205 --> 01:24:53.874
I don't know what's happening.

1097
01:24:53.916 --> 01:24:57.211
Tell me, Jillian, what is it?

1098
01:25:04.176 --> 01:25:06.176
He...

1099
01:25:07.471 --> 01:25:10.099
He's hiding inside me.

1100
01:25:13.435 --> 01:25:15.938
Hiding...

1101
01:25:16.939 --> 01:25:18.939
...inside me.

1102
01:25:33.455 --> 01:25:36.260
I think she's awake,
Mr. Armacost.


1103
01:26:03.485 --> 01:26:05.525
Tell me something, Jill.

1104
01:26:07.281 --> 01:26:08.724
lf the doctors...

1105
01:26:08.824 --> 01:26:12.309
...had any idea what you were thinking...

1106
01:26:12.369 --> 01:26:15.080
...you know, them awful...

1107
01:26:15.122 --> 01:26:17.122
...dark thoughts...

1108
01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:21.260
...what do you think they'd do?

1109
01:26:23.255 --> 01:26:25.255
They'd lock me up.

1110
01:26:31.764 --> 01:26:34.433
Lock you up?

1111
01:26:34.475 --> 01:26:37.705
They'd chain you to the wall, Jillian.

1112
01:26:39.938 --> 01:26:43.317
Yeah, put you back in that hospital.

1113
01:26:45.152 --> 01:26:47.192
You want that to happen?

1114
01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:55.621
I know you don't want that.

1115
01:26:55.662 --> 01:26:59.500
Well...we ain't gonna let 'em, are we?

1116
01:27:05.631 --> 01:27:08.096
'Cause we're gonna be strong.

1117
01:27:08.675 --> 01:27:10.675
We're gonna be strong.

1118
01:27:11.595 --> 01:27:12.871
Together.

1119
01:27:12.971 --> 01:27:16.116
We're gonna be strong for our family.

1120
01:27:22.022 --> 01:27:24.022
We're connected now.

1121
01:27:26.193 --> 01:27:30.528
You feel me inside there
where it's safe, don't you?


1122
01:27:35.411 --> 01:27:37.411
See?

1123
01:27:40.499 --> 01:27:42.499
I live here.

1124
01:27:44.044 --> 01:27:46.044
We're one.

1125
01:28:14.867 --> 01:28:17.927
Why do you have Sherman Reese's bag?

1126
01:28:19.913 --> 01:28:23.459
What did you do to my sister?

1127
01:28:25.377 --> 01:28:27.504
Who are you?

1128
01:28:29.923 --> 01:28:32.885
What the hell are you doing?

1129
01:28:32.926 --> 01:28:34.926
Let go of me!

1130
01:28:45.064 --> 01:28:47.064
Jillian! Help!

1131
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.020
Washington Square Park.

1132
01:31:04.495 --> 01:31:06.495
What?

1133
01:31:08.082 --> 01:31:10.317
Go. Go!
- But it is red, missis.


1134
01:31:10.417 --> 01:31:11.485
I don't care!
Just go!


1135
01:31:11.585 --> 01:31:12.695
But, missis, I cannot.

1136
01:31:12.795 --> 01:31:14.989
Will you go?!
You don't understand!


1137
01:31:15.089 --> 01:31:17.089
Please.
- I cannot.


1138
01:32:16.817 --> 01:32:21.492
Captain Alex Streck died
last night at eight fifty-five.


1139
01:32:22.114 --> 01:32:23.891
Cause of death has been determined...

1140
01:32:23.991 --> 01:32:26.966
...to have been a massive stroke...

1141
01:32:27.327 --> 01:32:30.564
...what the surgeons are calling
a severe insult to the brain.


1142
01:32:30.664 --> 01:32:33.542
He's not your husband anymore.

1143
01:33:41.693 --> 01:33:43.693
Welcome back, Mrs. A.

1144
01:33:54.498 --> 01:33:56.498
Good morning, Mr. A.

1145
01:36:23.897 --> 01:36:26.192
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Jill.

1146
01:36:49.757 --> 01:36:51.759
Stay away from me.

1147
01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.553
Why are you doing this to me?

1148
01:36:54.595 --> 01:36:58.098
I said stay...

1149
01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.140
...away from me.

1150
01:37:10.277 --> 01:37:12.012
Who are you?

1151
01:37:12.112 --> 01:37:14.615
Who am I?

1152
01:37:15.616 --> 01:37:20.971
I'm the only person in the world
who ever gave a fuck about you.


1153
01:37:22.122 --> 01:37:25.947
I'm the one that gave you
a reason to breathe.


1154
01:37:27.002 --> 01:37:31.932
I'm every single fuckin' moment
ever mattered in your life.


1155
01:37:32.633 --> 01:37:34.633
No, you’re not.

1156
01:37:35.969 --> 01:37:37.496
I don't even know you.

1157
01:37:37.596 --> 01:37:40.766
No? Well...

1158
01:37:40.808 --> 01:37:42.418
I'll tell you what.

1159
01:37:42.518 --> 01:37:45.587
There was a time I remember
when I was about to go up...


1160
01:37:45.687 --> 01:37:48.440
...and you begged me not to.

1161
01:37:48.482 --> 01:37:51.610
You remember how scared you were?

1162
01:37:51.652 --> 01:37:53.220
And I told you then...

1163
01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:57.725
...that I was gonna bring you back
a little piece of heaven.


1164
01:37:57.825 --> 01:37:59.827
Then you cried.

1165
01:37:59.868 --> 01:38:01.868
You remember that?

1166
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.523
Well, fuckin' a!

1167
01:38:04.623 --> 01:38:06.066
I did!

1168
01:38:06.166 --> 01:38:08.801
What do you think's inside you?

1169
01:38:13.006 --> 01:38:15.467
I gave you heaven.

1170
01:38:15.509 --> 01:38:18.011
No, you didn't.

1171
01:38:20.347 --> 01:38:22.391
You're not Spencer.

1172
01:38:26.061 --> 01:38:28.339
It don't got to be like this,
honey.


1173
01:38:28.439 --> 01:38:29.715
Please, come on, now.

1174
01:38:29.815 --> 01:38:31.550
Step out of that water.

1175
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:34.625
Please, baby,
get out of that water.


1176
01:38:35.696 --> 01:38:36.972
Come on.

1177
01:38:37.072 --> 01:38:39.072
Oh, my God.

1178
01:38:40.743 --> 01:38:42.743
Please.

1179
01:38:44.163 --> 01:38:46.331
Oh, my God.

1180
01:38:49.418 --> 01:38:51.712
You killed my sister.

1181
01:38:54.506 --> 01:38:57.676
You killed my husband.

1182
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:06.852
I did.

1183
01:39:10.397 --> 01:39:12.692
And then I fucked his wife.

1184
01:39:16.278 --> 01:39:18.278
I live there.

1185
01:39:45.974 --> 01:39:48.560
I live there...

1186
01:39:48.602 --> 01:39:49.878
...forever.

1187
01:39:49.978 --> 01:39:51.978
No, you don't.

1188
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.898
I live there.

1189
01:40:09.998 --> 01:40:11.998
No, you don't!

1190
01:41:14.688 --> 01:41:16.924
Ready for your first day of school?

1191
01:41:17.024 --> 01:41:18.175
Ready.

1192
01:41:18.275 --> 01:41:20.094
Wait.

1193
01:41:20.194 --> 01:41:24.098
There's an apple in there,
and I want you guys to eat it.


1194
01:41:24.198 --> 01:41:25.265
No trading.
Promise?


1195
01:41:25.365 --> 01:41:26.600
Promise.

1196
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.869
OK. Give me a kiss.

1197
01:41:31.205 --> 01:41:32.439
Go, go, go, go, go.

1198
01:41:32.539 --> 01:41:34.539
Be good.

1199
01:41:37.711 --> 01:41:40.114
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?


1200
01:41:40.214 --> 01:41:41.740
Grow up?

1201
01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.827
Give them some time, Susan.
It's their first day of school.


1202
01:41:44.927 --> 01:41:46.927
I think...

1203
01:41:49.431 --> 01:41:51.500
...they're gonna be pilots.

1204
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.603
Just like their father.

1205
01:41:54.603 --> 01:41:56.603
Stepfather.

1206
01:42:01.068 --> 01:42:03.904
You're their father now.
