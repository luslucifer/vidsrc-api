All this stuff
must be priceless.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.240
I can't melt
down priceless.


32
00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.376
Don't touch nothing!

33
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.179
We're here for the coins,
that's it.

Everything else in
here can be traced.

[Blades] I had
to drop a guard.


37
00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.358
What'd you do that for?

38
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.227
We're hired guns, what
do you expect us to do?


39
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.462
But they're
gonna call security


40
00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.130
if he doesn't check in.

41
00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.834
I took him out, so he
wouldn't alert security.


42
00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.202
But they're gonna make us
soon, so get what you came for


43
00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:58.837
and let's get
the hell out of here.


44
00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:59.938
Right.

45
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.779
What is all this?

46
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:09.748
A bunch of stuff so valuable
we can't sell it anywhere.


47
00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.018
Is he dead?

48
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.254
What do you think?

49
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.790
Gotcha.

I told you not
to touch anything.


56
00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:49.120
Hey, there are things in
here you don't wanna mess with.


57
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.457
I told you,
hands off.


58
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.527
We don't have time for this,
let go of the stupid thing.

[crowd chattering]

76
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.904
No, no, no, the
rules clearly state


77
00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:15.306
that the Alpha Rift can
only be opened by the Nobleman


78
00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.342
who's captured
the Devil's Apostle first.


79
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:19.444
Thus the word alpha,
dumb ass.


80
00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.246
Lewis,
what'd I tell you


81
00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.614
about spazzing
out on the customers?


82
00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:24.082
He doesn't
know the rules.


83
00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.117
[Nolan] Hey, just
take a chill, will ya?


84
00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.119
Go make one of your
chi lattes or something.


85
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.221
A game master never
leaves his post.


86
00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:33.024
I'm not asking you to
neglect your duties, Sir Lewis.


87
00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:35.126
I'm just going to
go over the rules.


88
00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.929
No rolls?

89
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:38.997
No rolls, I swear.

90
00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:49.173
It's just Lewis.

91
00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.442
[laughter]

92
00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:54.345
Okay now,
let's start at the beginning.


93
00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:55.914
[dramatic music]

94
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.049
Since the dark ages,
there were four Noblemen


95
00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.218
sworn to defend
against dark forces,


96
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.653
each a royal
in their own right,


97
00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:04.255
noble blood
flowing through their veins.


98
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.424
And who's
their sworn enemy?


99
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.592
[Dillon] The Devil's Apostles.

100
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.027
That's right.

101
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.095
The Devil's Apostles,

102
00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.098
pure evil souls that possess
the bodies of mortal men.


103
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.201
When free to roam the earth,
darkness reigns.


104
00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.636
And the only
way to stop them?


105
00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.939
- [Gianna] The Noblemen?
- [Dillon] The four helms?


106
00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.441
Both right, the four
helms of the Noblemen.


107
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.110
Now the
Noblemen's only super power,


108
00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.645
if you wanna call it that,

109
00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:30.982
are four helmets
forged by a powerful sorcerer.


110
00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:34.185
They give its bearer a
power to open up the rift


111
00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:37.588
between our world and purgatory,
the Alpha Rift,


112
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.491
a prison where
evil can be trapped.


113
00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.994
And when the evil
escapes the Alpha Rift,


114
00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.330
it is up to the heirs to
step up and face their destiny.


115
00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:46.998
And over time, the
bloodline has spread


116
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.100
throughout
the entire world.


117
00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:51.002
I mean,
who knows?


118
00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:53.271
Maybe you could possess
the bloodline of a Nobleman,


119
00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:55.406
or you, or you.

120
00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:58.042
But definitely not Lewis,
right? [laughs]


121
00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.312
He's right behind me,
isn't he?


122
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.081
[Lewis] No need to get nasty.

123
00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:04.716
I'm just kidding.

124
00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.051
Look,
seems to me these guys get it.


125
00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.686
12 evil
demons are hunted by


126
00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:11.155
four knights and their descendants
who wear magic helmets.


127
00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.757
It's a simple fairytale.

128
00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:15.693
You mean legend based
on actual historical data.


129
00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.261
Yeah, okay,
Lewis.


130
00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:18.663
Like the
Alpha Rift is real,


131
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.698
and there's some
secret society of Noblemen


132
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.434
locked in a timeless
battle of good versus evil,


133
00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:25.169
as if.

134

[feet pounding]

Where is it?

139
00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.346
Ah! [cover rustling]

140
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.252
Recognize him?

141
00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:16.754
We fired him
a few months ago


142
00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:19.357
for stealing
of all things.


143
00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:20.725
Yeah,
well that explains


144
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.693
how they got
passed our security system.


145
00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.230
Looks like he had help,

146
00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:28.733
[case crashes]

147
00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:29.534
coins are gone,

148
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.271
and there's
traces of an exit.


149
00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:36.474
So there's most
certainly someone else.


150
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.778
You mean something else.

151
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.717
What do you wanna do?

152
00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:49.587
I think there's only
one thing we can do.


153
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.456
Are you sure?

154
00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:52.723
He's not ready.

155
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:57.528
It is time to bring our
young man into the fold.


156
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.603
All right,
you rugrats.


157
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.605
Are you guys ready
to become Noblemen?


158
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.840
- Yes?
- [Kids] Yeah.


159
00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.274
Yeah!

160
00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:13.177
Awesome, okay, so
let's raise your swords


161
00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.246
and let's go
clobber some bad guys.


162
00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:18.382
Oh, whoa, Gabby, we
never clobber bad guys.


163
00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.750
[feet thudding]

164
00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:23.187
He does this, cut, cut,
parry, repost, turn, block,


165
00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:24.755
bind away,
and thrust!


166
00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:28.192
Okay, Lord Nolan, you
are scaring the children.


167
00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:32.797
Prepare to be knighted.

168
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:38.269
I now proclaim you
knights of the Noblemen.


169
00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:42.640
A Noblemen is sworn to valor,
his heart knows only virtue.


170
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.576
Um, excuse me, there
is a "Noble-woman" there.


171
00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:48.813
I stand corrected.

172
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.915
You keep him in
line for me, okay.


173
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.550
Will do.

174
00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:54.152
Nice, we gotta watch
out for those boys.


175
00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.590
Where was I?

176
00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:03.561
Oh, yes,
the Noblemen and women,


177
00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:06.397
their hearts
know only virtue,


178
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.766
their blades
defend the innocent,


179
00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:10.801
their words
speak only truth,


180
00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:13.938
and their wrath
undoes the wicked.


181
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.274
I now proclaim you
knights of the Noblemen.


182
00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:17.808
[All] Yay!

183
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.609
[Nolan laughs]

184
00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:19.810
Awesome.

185
00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.179
[Charlie] Man, you've
got strong hands.


186
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.180
[Nolan]
Thank you so much.


187
00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.281
Can I help you?

188
00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:24.515
- [Mother] Hi.
- [Nolan] Hi.


189
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.852
My son was
wondering if, well,


190
00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:31.689
I was wondering
if you could help me


191
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.692
to pick out a good
entry level game for my son.


192

[playful music]

193
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.296
Ever since his dad left, it's
been hard to find a good man.


194
00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:46.537
I mean,
a man as a role model.


195
00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.739
I get it,
it's no worries.


196
00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.708
Come over here.

197
00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.912
That Debra is
such a little slut.


198
00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.648
She may as well
have a sign around her neck.


199
00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.318
I dunno, I think he's
pretty cute [laughs].

[till crashing]

201
00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:04.222
- Ma'am?
- [Woman] Sorry.


202
00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:06.224
Your change.

203
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.460
I was a bit distracted
by your coworker.


204
00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.861
Oh, yeah.

205
00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:12.897
You know,
I know how you feel.


206
00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:16.834
If it wasn't for that
ugly rash on his ass,


207
00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.236
I'd be into him too.

208
00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:21.806
Sometimes when the
blisters stop oozing pus,


209
00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:25.910
the smell lets up,
and maybe then I'd go for it.


210
00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:30.348
But then again, his temper
and his violent outbursts.


211
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.917
You want to see, I have a
scar that I hide with this hat.


212
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:33.684
Do you wanna see it?

213
00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:34.685
Thank you.

214
00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.320
Thank you,
you can keep that.


215
00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.388
Sure.

216

Marking your territory,
I see.


219
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.264
No,
we're just friends.


220
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.732
Uh-huh! [laughs]

221
00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:49.467
Okay, what do
you want, landlady,


222
00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:50.901
rent isn't due till Friday?

223
00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:52.870
I wanted to get a gift
for my nephew's birthday,


224
00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:56.774
but looks like
Nolan has his hands full.


225
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.943
Yeah, I can help,
what you need?


226
00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.679
No, he was telling me about
this new game last week.


227
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:02.780
I'll come back later.

228
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.782
You're open till 9:00,
right?


229
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.817
Well, if you give us
a free month's rent,


230
00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.686
we'll stay open
as late as you want.


231
00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:11.422
- 9:00 is fine,
- Ah man.


232
00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:12.790
rent's still due on Friday.

233
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.325
Worth a shot.

What the hell happened?

237
00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.821
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you,


238
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:48.626
but the payday,
better than expecting.

This can't be right.

242
00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:04.608
Now, that's an understatement.

243
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.977
I thought we were just
hired to help steal some coins.


244
00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:09.547
I don't recall any
mention of a killer green mist.

Cut the bullshit!

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.717
What happened?

247
00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:13.751
See for yourself?

you were an artist.

Oh my God!

Looks like you
were a regular Picasso.

[Nolan] Where
did you find that?

It was in the junk box.

Sorry,
your box of treasures.

Hey, be careful,

that book is a collectors' item.

For what, like a pedophile?

260

Hey, give me.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:00.498
Okay.

Look, you know I'm a fan
of your charming personality,

I'm really sorry, I
didn't know,

I thought you shared all
that stuff with me already.

It wasn't something
worth sharing,

it was just a
memory. [Nolan sighs]

Nathan is fine, you know,
you can call him that.


323
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.864
Nonsense,
you can be Nolan.


324

Whoa, did you paint
these all yourself?


327
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.139
[Lewis] Of course.

328
00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:25.042
Any true master would
never outsource such a task.

Hey, Casanova,

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:31.549
What,
did you order that?


331
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:35.586
Not me, but it could be
from one of your sugar mamas.

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:37.121
Stop it, it looks
like a replica.


333
00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:42.326
No, it's definitely
like a million years old.


334
00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:44.828
I doubt it's a

Say, Nolan,
why don't you try it on?


337
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.705
Ho-ho, yes, stud,
here, put it on, come on.

Come on, sport.

339
00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:58.075
Yeah, Nolan, put it on.

340
00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.077
Yeah, okay, fine.

341
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.146
I'll be the

Nolan!

354
00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:47.625

I must go.

Hey, you may not be
yourself right now,


362

don't sit back down,

00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:39.536
many years ago when
your father was still alive.


489
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:40.604
You knew my dad?

490
00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:42.205
[Corbin] Yes, I did.

491
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.573
[feet thundering]

492
00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:44.741
You're awake.

493
00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:46.543
Are you okay?

494
00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.378
You were out like a light.

495
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.746
Yeah, tell me about it.

496
00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:52.082
You know, it was like the
red witch put a spell on me


497
00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:53.583
or something.

498
00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:55.352
More like the scarlet
witch messed with your head.


499
00:25:55.354 --> 00:25:57.387
Oh yeah [laughs].

500
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:58.488
I told you
this is a bad idea.


501
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.556
He's not our guy.

502
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:00.524
What?

503
00:26:01.527 --> 00:26:03.393
Why am I not your guy?

504
00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.761
Because you're a clown.

505
00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:06.296
And I don't think
the fate of the world


506
00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:08.665
should be placed in
the hands of a fanboy.


507
00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:10.367
Fate of the world?

508
00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:12.636
You serious?

509
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:17.441
You are serious.

510
00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:22.245
Nolan, your father,
that helmet, the Noblemen,


511
00:26:23.282 --> 00:26:26.483
you, they're all connected.

512
00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:29.719
What if I told
you that the Noblemen


513
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:32.255
were more
than just a story?


514
00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:35.258
[handcuffs clanking]

515
00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:41.298
[Blades] Going somewhere?

516
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.633
Oh, just... great.

517
00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.636
Hey, man, you have a
fun night out on the town?


518
00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:47.838
You meet any honeys?

519
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.440
Why would I
want to eat honey?


520
00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.442
It's an expression.

521
00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.611
You're
wasting your breath.


522
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:55.712
He's obviously
not Blades anymore.


523
00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:57.781
Yeah, you think.

524
00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:02.252
Hey, bud, what'd you
do with my man Blades?


525
00:27:02.254 --> 00:27:03.854
Oh, he's in here.

526
00:27:03.856 --> 00:27:06.556
I needed a
strong soul as a host,


527
00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:09.259
and your
friend is a dark evil.


528
00:27:09.261 --> 00:27:10.560
What?

529
00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:13.430
Like Saruman or
some stuff like that?


530
00:27:13.432 --> 00:27:15.799
Whose this sorry
man that you speak of?


531
00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:18.768
It's "Lord of the Rings", man,

532
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.303
ain't they got
books where you're from?


533
00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:22.239
I have been in prison
for nearly a millennium.


534
00:27:22.241 --> 00:27:23.874
Every time I
tried to escape,


535
00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:26.510
the Noblemen
pulled me back.


536
00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:29.312
I feel you, brother, the
whole system is corrupt.


537
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:32.149
I got sent up for a
speeding ticket once.


538
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:33.817
Of course, I had a trash
bag of pot in my back seat.


539
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:35.619
[Pavlov laughs]

540
00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:37.420
What kind of prison,
like county,


541
00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:39.689
or one of those
hard core federal joints?


542
00:27:41.727 --> 00:27:43.527
This was my prison.

543
00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:46.329
Wow, that's dope.

544
00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:48.932
What did you call me?

545
00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:51.334
It's a figure of speech,
man.


546
00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:52.802
[Pavlov huffs]

547
00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:56.439
You know, if you
wanna roll in the 21st century,


548
00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:58.508
you're gonna need someone
like me to show you the ropes.


549
00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:11.488
Good, now get us out
of these God damn chains!


550
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.424
The stories
you grew up with,


551
00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:17.227
specifically the
stories your father told you,


552
00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:19.462
were all true.

553
00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:22.899
What if I were to tell
you that this helmet is real?


554
00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:25.735
It's 1,247 years old.

555
00:28:26.972 --> 00:28:30.373
What if I told you
the Noblemen were real?


556
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:33.210
Well, assuming you
guys are not crazy,


557
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:35.579
that would mean that
the Devil's Apostles are real.


558
00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:36.813
Yeah.

559
00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:38.615
That man who
attacked you tonight


560
00:28:38.617 --> 00:28:41.651
was possessed by
one of the Devil's Apostles.


561
00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.353
Attacked me?

562
00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:44.888
No,
it looked like Sergeant Sledge


563
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.957
and the Black Widow
over there were attacking him.


564
00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:49.559
I saved your life, you
ungrateful little prick.


565
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.361
We were trying
to capture the beast.


566
00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:52.362
Subdue it until...

567
00:28:52.364 --> 00:28:53.363
No, no...

568
00:28:54.266 --> 00:28:56.499
What, until what?

569
00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:02.906
Until the heir of
Geldemoore was confirmed.


570
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:05.308
Oh, the guy in the
parking lot called me that.


571
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.344
Your father was a
direct descendant of


572
00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:10.513
Sir Auric Geldemoore,
one of the original Noblemen.


573
00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:12.282
Seriously?

574
00:29:12.284 --> 00:29:14.618
Okay,
now I call bullshit.


575
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.919
Really?

576
00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:17.887
How do you explain
what happened to him


577
00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:19.422
when he put the helmet on?

578
00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:23.493
Your bloodline is like a
key that opens that helmet.


579
00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:25.996
But, alas,
it also calls out


580
00:29:25.998 --> 00:29:28.265
to those that have
been imprisoned by it.


581
00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:30.367
Come on!

582
00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:33.370
You can't possibly
believe these weirdos.


583
00:29:33.372 --> 00:29:35.839
C'mon, Nol,
we're out of here.


584
00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:38.575
The man
possessed by Dragsmere


585
00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:41.278
won't stop until
he ends the bloodline.


586
00:29:42.481 --> 00:29:43.580
You mean end me?

587
00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:44.814
[Corbin] Yes.

588
00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:46.549
And anyone else
in the bloodline.


589
00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:48.652
But since you're the only
heir within 1,000 mile radius,


590
00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:50.053
you're at the
top of that list,


591
00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:52.422
which is why we
brought the helmet to you.


592
00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.360
You did this on purpose?

593
00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:59.329
Can't catch
fish without bait.


594
00:29:59.331 --> 00:30:01.331
I was bait?

595
00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:02.599
You used me?

596
00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:04.534
See, okay,
let's go.


597
00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:07.804
We tested you,
we had to be sure.


598
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.372
Sure of what?

599
00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:10.874
That this
is your destiny.


600
00:30:14.513 --> 00:30:15.612
I like the
sound of that.


601
00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:18.014
What?

602
00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:22.452
[teeth crunching]

603
00:30:22.454 --> 00:30:24.954
You know you're not supposed
to eat the bones, right?


604
00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.990
[teeth crunching]

605
00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:28.958
A little extra
calcium never hurt nobody.


606
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.428
[plate clanks]

607
00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:34.731
[Pavlov huffs]

608
00:30:34.733 --> 00:30:36.433
I don't know I
bother cooking 'em.


609
00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:37.767
He probably
would have ate 'em raw.


610
00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.869
Stop poking the bear,

611
00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:40.770
you're asking for trouble.

612
00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:43.807
A little late for
that, don't you think?


613
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.711
[teeth crunching]

614
00:30:47.713 --> 00:30:50.714
[tracker bleeping]

615
00:30:50.716 --> 00:30:53.450
[dramatic music]

616
00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:00.056
[feet pounding]

617
00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:03.927
[bleeping]

618
00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:12.402
So that's him just
sitting in that building?


619
00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:14.771
Yes, he went there
after the attack.


620
00:31:14.773 --> 00:31:16.473
The taser darts
that we shot at him


621
00:31:16.475 --> 00:31:18.007
have tracking
devices in them.


622
00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.577
Why don't
you just go get him?


623
00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:22.579
As long as he stays put,

624
00:31:22.581 --> 00:31:24.981
it's best to
leave sleeping dogs lie.


625
00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:26.950
He was drawn
to that building,


626
00:31:26.952 --> 00:31:30.019
most likely some kind
of connection with his host.


627
00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:33.523
Hey,
that's my parking lot,


628
00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:35.525
that's the inside of
my store. [unit crashing]


629
00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:37.060
How did you get
video from inside my store?


630
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:38.528
What the hell?

631
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.597
You're spying on us.

632
00:31:40.599 --> 00:31:42.999
We bought the building
right after Nolan opened shop,


633
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:44.100
becoming his landlord

634
00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.769
was the best way
to keep an eye on him.


635
00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:48.538
We had to get easy access,
maintain surveillance,


636
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.773
hide cameras.

637
00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:53.176
Seriously, what if I
was naked or something?


638
00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:54.411
In the store?

639
00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:56.446
That's not the point.

640
00:31:56.448 --> 00:31:58.882
[All] What is your point?

641
00:31:58.884 --> 00:32:02.685
Point? Point! Don't you
guys have any idea of normal?


642
00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:05.422
I mean, come on,
geez!


643
00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:07.090
[Gabby groans]

644
00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:08.758
Well now you did it.

645
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.427
She's gonna
be pissed for hours.


646
00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:13.496
A servant of
the devil himself


647
00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:16.166
sits in a building a
few miles from here.


648
00:32:16.168 --> 00:32:21.137
An argument with your girlfriend
seems of little concern.


649
00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:22.505
Girlfriend?

650
00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:24.474
Oh, no,
we're just friends.


651
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:27.444
Sure you are.

652
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:29.112
[playful music]

653
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:31.748
In here we have an
assortment of exercise clothes


654
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.450
in various sizes.

655
00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:34.951
Over there is the bath,

656
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:38.655
and of course, the
refreshments in the mini bar.


657
00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:40.623
Why,
thank you, fine sir.


658
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:43.626
Do be sure to let the
hounds out before tea time,


659
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.995
and, oh,
Lord Nolan here would like


660
00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:47.230
two mints on his pillow.

661
00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:53.002
If you need anything,
I'll be down the hall.


662
00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:55.939
Ta-ta!

663
00:32:56.775 --> 00:32:58.475
[door slams]

664
00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.910
Well, it looks like
you're in prime form.


665
00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.178
Prime form?

666
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.680
We're prisoners.

667
00:33:03.682 --> 00:33:05.648
Down the hall? Yeah right,

668
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.252
how about I'm down
the hall blocking your exit.


669
00:33:09.254 --> 00:33:10.753
Come on,
it's not that bad.


670
00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.922
They gave us our phones,
why would they do that?


671
00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:16.860
I bet you they're jamming
our calls right now, okay.


672
00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:18.761
I'll show you.

673
00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:22.165
Lewis always
answers his phone,


674
00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:24.450
even when he's
playing a game. [phone rings]


675
00:33:24.452 --> 00:33:26.736
I'll bet they'll jam this
call with some kind of...


676
00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.505
[Lewis] Hey,
Gabby, how's Nolan?


677
00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:30.173
I'm fine,
thanks for asking.


678
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:31.541
How's the store?

679
00:33:31.543 --> 00:33:32.909
[Lewis] All good here,
chief.


680
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:34.744
After you passed out,
Vicars was kind enough


681
00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:35.912
to have his men
help us clean up the mess


682
00:33:35.914 --> 00:33:37.013
and close the store.

683
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:38.982
You trust those guys?

684
00:33:38.984 --> 00:33:39.816
[Lewis] Oh, yeah.

685
00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:41.017
They tell me that Nolan's

686
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.685
a descendant of
the original Noblemen,


687
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.153
and he's the
heir of Geldemoore.


688
00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.788
And you
just believe that?


689
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.156
[Lewis] Of course,
I always knew


690
00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:49.158
there was a touch
of destiny about him.


691
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.894
I mean,
it makes perfect sense.


692
00:33:50.896 --> 00:33:53.062
After all,
his dad has a mysterious past,


693
00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:55.265
and he's been into the
Noblemen his entire life.


694
00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:56.566
All that's
missing is for him


695
00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:58.101
to get bit by a
radioactive spider.


696
00:33:58.103 --> 00:33:59.536
What's he saying?

697
00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:01.271
[Lewis] Whoa, we
are in the middle


698
00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:03.540
of a legit origin story,
how cool is that?


699
00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:05.241
He buys the
destiny crap as well.


700
00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:11.714
Oh well, we're gonna stay
at this guy's mansion tonight.


701
00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:15.051
They gave us a nice
room with a minibar, so...


702
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:17.120
[Lewis] You're sharing a room?

703
00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:21.257
Finally, I was wondering
when you two were gonna hook up.


704
00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:23.293
Sometimes the
hormones flying between you...


705
00:34:23.295 --> 00:34:27.564
What, no,
that is not what...


706
00:34:27.566 --> 00:34:28.598
[playful music]

707
00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:33.736
Look, just do me a favor

708
00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:36.673
and follow my location,
okay.


709
00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:39.776
I will send you an
invite to track my phone.


710
00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:42.645
And if you see us suddenly head
toward a swamp or something,


711
00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.581
call the cops,
okay?


712
00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:47.984
Otherwise I'll check in
with you in the morning.


713
00:34:47.986 --> 00:34:49.285
[Lewis] Roger that.

714
00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.621
If the van's a rocking,
don't come a knocking.


715
00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:52.855
[phone clicks]

716
00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:55.058
What was that all about?

717
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.360
You know Lewis,
bonkers crazy.


718
00:34:57.362 --> 00:34:58.227
Yeah, I do.

719
00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:01.898
Oh,
so I guess I'll take the couch.


720
00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:04.100
The couch?

721
00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:07.737
There's only one
bed, unless you want...


722
00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:10.006
Want to what? I mean...

723
00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:12.909
Oh, the couch,
do I want the couch?


724
00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:15.144
Yeah, sure.

725
00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:19.315
Yes, I mean, apparently
you're the man of destiny,


726
00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:22.085
so better get a
good night's sleep and all.


727
00:35:22.087 --> 00:35:24.821
I actually prefer couches.

728
00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:27.924
I mean, I usually fall
asleep binge watching anyhow.


729
00:35:27.926 --> 00:35:29.792
So like,
what's the difference?


730
00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:33.863
Yeah, bro,
I got this, bed is yours.


731
00:35:36.768 --> 00:35:37.400
Thanks.

732
00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:41.137
Good night.

733
00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:43.139
Good night.

[birds singing]

735
00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:08.698
Good morning,
princess.


736
00:36:09.968 --> 00:36:11.334
[Gabby] What time is it?

737
00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:13.002
It's time for you
to get a shower,


738
00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.904
and put on
some fresh clothes.


739
00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.839
You don't wanna miss Nolan's
first day of training, do you?


740
00:36:18.243 --> 00:36:19.375
I don't need a shower,
okay.


741
00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.077
Let's just go.

742
00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:23.880
Let's not, you
kinda smell like feet.


743
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.382
Meet me in the Great Room.

744
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.320
[Gabby sniffs]

745
00:36:33.792 --> 00:36:36.926
I used to say one
never knows, do one?


746
00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:37.860
[Kate laughs]

747
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.262
Absolutely.

748
00:36:39.264 --> 00:36:42.298
There she is,
it's about time.


749
00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:47.870
Excuse me, my lady, would
you like cream or sugar?


750
00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.939
- Black.
- [Butler] Very well.


751
00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:52.075
So, why'd you
sleep on the couch?


752
00:36:52.077 --> 00:36:55.111
Bed not comfortable, or...

753
00:36:56.114 --> 00:36:58.047
Yeah, something like that.

754
00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:02.051
I'll actually have
the cream and sugar.


755
00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.152
[Butler] Very well.

756
00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:04.320
Here, I wanna
show you something.


757
00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.022
We have a
direct feed to our gym.


758
00:37:06.024 --> 00:37:07.490
You have a gym?

759
00:37:07.492 --> 00:37:10.727
Oh yeah, we have
all kinds of things.


760
00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:13.796
So they should be just
about ready to go by now.


761
00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:16.365
Yep,
he's all suited up.


762
00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:19.902
[dramatic music]

763
00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:27.376
So my dad was a
real life Nobleman?


764
00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:28.778
Yeah.

765
00:37:31.149 --> 00:37:32.415
Wait, but if...

766
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:35.118
Please,
speak your mind.


767
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.519
Okay.

768
00:37:36.521 --> 00:37:39.122
If he was, that means
we're relatives with a dude


769
00:37:39.124 --> 00:37:40.456
who lived a
thousand years ago.


770
00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:41.824
Yes.

771
00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:42.992
But what about
my other relatives?


772
00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:44.961
I mean, I can't
possibly be the only one.


773
00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:47.964
You're not, but
it's more than just


774
00:37:47.966 --> 00:37:50.166
the blood in your veins.

775
00:37:50.168 --> 00:37:52.168
You've been groomed
for this your whole life,


776
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.537
whether you
knew it or not.


777
00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:57.974
There is another heir
that's been acclimated like you,


778
00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:00.309
but she lives in Panama.

779
00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:01.511
She?

780
00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:03.279
What,
she can be a woman too?


781
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:07.950
Of course, if you get
killed, she'll take your place.


782
00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.887
And if she falls,
there'll be another.


783
00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:15.558
Sounds like you have
it all worked out.


784
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.193
Looks like I'm just
meat for the grinder.

Well,
that's why you train.

will protect him.

Stop, Lord
Dragsmere won't stop.


797
00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:49.492
He was
imprisoned by your father,


798
00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:53.029
so he has a very
strong connection to you.


799
00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:54.063
What for?

800
00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.832
To kill you.

801
00:38:55.834 --> 00:38:57.433
If he can kill every
heir in your bloodline


802
00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:58.868
he'll be free
to roam the earth,

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.937
and no one can stop him.

804
00:39:00.939 --> 00:39:02.038
Now attack me!

805
00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:04.207
Seriously?

806
00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:05.908
Go for it.

807
00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:07.143
[sword bashes]

808
00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:07.944
[Vicars] Come on!

809
00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:11.080
[swords crash]

810
00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.250
[Nolan groans]

811
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.386
Get up,
you idiot.


812
00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.021
Cut the bastard in half.

813
00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:23.192
Oh, this really sucks.

814
00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:26.095
Why not have
him fight the demon?


815
00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.930
I mean, he's all
piss and vinegar anyhow.


816
00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:30.566
I can't,
he's immortal.


817
00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.368
Oh, bloodline,
I almost forgot.


818
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.905
Correct, your two
souls are connected.


819
00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:39.208
That's how he found you
when you put the helmet on.


820
00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.277
Oh boy,
was that an acid trip.


821
00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:42.578
What happened to me?

822
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.648
Put the helmet on
and I'll explain.


823
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.150
Ah, no,
stupid idea.


824
00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.952
I say we just get
the girl from Panama.


825
00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:52.154
We can hold off
Dragsmere until she's ready.


826
00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:56.492
He's just a spineless fanboy,
no offense.


827
00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:59.996
None taken,
ass hat.


828
00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:04.000
Just put the helmet on,
you're in a safe place.


829
00:40:04.002 --> 00:40:07.270
Put the helmet on,
and you'll understand.


830
00:40:19.284 --> 00:40:21.684
[whooshing]

831
00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:25.187
Now, just don't
hold your breath, breathe.


832
00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:26.489
Breathe.

833
00:40:26.491 --> 00:40:28.925
Breathe,
now tell me what you see.


834
00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:31.327

[bottle smashes]

837
00:40:44.342 --> 00:40:46.342
[Rilek] Snap out of it.

838
00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:47.310
He's hungry again?

839
00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:51.514
Geez, he eats like a hippo.

840
00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:55.484
[coins clattering]

841
00:40:55.486 --> 00:41:00.056
Hey bud,
is he calling to you again?


842
00:41:00.058 --> 00:41:03.459
He's getting help.

843
00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.362
[doors smash]

844
00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:09.065
[feet pounding]

845
00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:11.467
It's about
freaking time.


846
00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.302
It's Blades,
kill the son of a bitch.


847
00:41:15.073 --> 00:41:17.073

[fist smacks]
[balls clatter]


854
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:57.446
Nice try.

855
00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:01.517
I'll see you in hell.

856
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.186
Already been there.

857
00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:06.522
[gun bangs]

[Pavlov sighs loudly]

862
00:42:56.374 --> 00:42:57.273
So, are we cool?

863
00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.511
[Nolan sighs]

864
00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:04.346
[helmet clatters]

865

[Nolan retches]

866
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.117
Better.

867
00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:09.752
Do it again.

868
00:43:09.754 --> 00:43:11.720
[Nolan] Are you outta
your stinking mind?


869
00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:13.823
[Vicars] This is
a waste of time.


870
00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:15.758
He's not helping.

871
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.527
Stop being a child, man
up and muscle through.


872
00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:21.564
If you did something other
than play games your whole life,


873
00:43:21.566 --> 00:43:24.400
you'd realize that the real
world is a much tougher place.


874
00:43:24.402 --> 00:43:25.634
The real world!

875
00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:27.169
Don't get me started.

876
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.237
Enough!

877
00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:29.805
Vicars,
give us a break for a bit.


878
00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:32.675
Gladly.
[feet tapping]


879
00:43:32.677 --> 00:43:35.244
Hey, don't let the door
hit you on the way out.


880
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:40.483
Nolan, we're dealing with
ancient supernatural forces


881
00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:43.752
that modern
technology cannot explain.


882
00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:47.156
I don't fully
comprehend how it all works,


883
00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:50.359
but evil exists,
it will always exist.


884
00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:53.362
It's just the
balance of nature.


885
00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:56.765
All we can do is trap evil,
lock it away,


886
00:43:56.767 --> 00:44:00.202
keep it from
influencing mankind.


887
00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:02.805
You've heard
of Pandora's box,


888
00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:05.541
the fall of Rome, World War II,

889
00:44:05.543 --> 00:44:07.743
the Kardashians.

890
00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:09.712
The Kardashians?

891
00:44:09.714 --> 00:44:12.481
Yeah, I just wanna see if
you were paying attention.


892
00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:14.817
Ah,
there you go, that's the spirit.


893
00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.653
Take it in,
just relax a little.


894
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:22.625
Nolan, I too am an
heir of the Noblemen,


895
00:44:22.627 --> 00:44:24.693
but a different
bloodline than yours.


896
00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:26.428
Watch me.

897
00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:31.901
[whooshing]

898
00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:33.936
Nothing bad is
happening to you,


899
00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:35.504
it's just
sensory overload.


900
00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:37.740
So I gotta just chill?

901
00:44:37.742 --> 00:44:39.909
Yeah, it's a good word,

902
00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:44.213
like a salmon
swimming in cool glacial waters.


903
00:44:44.215 --> 00:44:45.247
I don't think you...

904
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.516
Never mind.

905
00:44:57.562 --> 00:44:59.562
[whooshing]

906
00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:12.975
The room isn't moving,
only you and me.


907
00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:17.446
[Corbin] And this...

908
00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:21.283
[sword thuds]

909
00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.752
Ah, the ripples are time.

910
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:25.921
A Premonition!

911
00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:27.957
But how can I
predict my own movements?


912
00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:29.658
[Corbin]
That's the challenge.


913
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.794
You have to feel
what your body's telling you,


914
00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:33.362
and go with it.

915
00:45:33.364 --> 00:45:36.232
Oh, I get it, like
"Feel the force, Luke".


916
00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:37.967
I don't think so.

917
00:45:37.969 --> 00:45:40.269
[Nolan] Lighten up, I get it.

918
00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:43.772
The helmet gives me a
vision of the immediate future.


919
00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:45.674
It's like two seconds.

920
00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:48.844
[Corbin] Right, and in a
fight that's an eternity.


921
00:45:48.846 --> 00:45:50.479
Am I stronger too?

922
00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:53.315
No, but you can train to
get stronger and faster.


923
00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.917
Trust me,
it makes a world of difference.


924
00:45:56.721 --> 00:45:57.853
En garde!

925
00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:59.855
[swords crashing]

926
00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:06.829
Very good.

927
00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:08.998
Vicars!

928
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.500
[Vicars yells]

929
00:46:12.637 --> 00:46:13.769
Hey, Vic,
slow on the uptake?


930
00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:18.574
[swords crash]

931
00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:21.477
Oh, who's the punk now?

932
00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:23.812
Come on, old man,
is that the best you can do?


933
00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:26.048
I wouldn't say
that if I were you.


934
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.549
Is that the
best you can do?


935
00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:29.385
[Nolan] Ha-ha, I'm
just getting started.


936
00:46:29.387 --> 00:46:30.052
Me too.

937
00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:31.654
Oh boy!

938
00:46:31.656 --> 00:46:34.290
[swords crashing]

939
00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:36.725
God damn.

940
00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:39.695
[swords crashing]

941
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.533
[Nolan] Stop, I give up.

942
00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:46.068
Do you think Lord
Dragsmere would give up?


943
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.303
[sword crashes]

944
00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:48.637
You still think
this is a game?


945
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:49.672
Enough!

946
00:46:51.442 --> 00:46:53.842
[Nolan groaning]

947
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.548
Got nothing to say, no
snarky comeback, smart ass?


948
00:47:01.452 --> 00:47:03.819
Your father would
be ashamed of you.


949
00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:07.456
Enough, it's not right to
hit a man when he's down.


950
00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:08.757
He shouldn't be here!

951
00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.734
He's right.

952
00:47:18.736 --> 00:47:21.003
Don't listen to what he says.

953
00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:24.106
Your father was not
born a warrior, it takes time.


954
00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:25.674
I'm not your guy.

955
00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.910
I mean, you even said there are
others.


956
00:47:27.912 --> 00:47:31.547
I'd prefer them to
take my place voluntarily,


957
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:33.782
rather than take this
helmet from my dead corpse.


958
00:47:36.454 --> 00:47:37.619
I'm sorry.

959
00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:39.922
Me too.

960
00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:53.936

[fire crackling]

969
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.563
Hey, Nol,
how you feeling?


970
00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:55.631
What do you think?

971
00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:57.866
No need to
lash out at her.


972
00:48:57.868 --> 00:49:01.470
If you want to be mad at
somebody, it should be me.


973
00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:05.541
I'm sorry, Gabs.

974
00:49:05.543 --> 00:49:07.543
It's okay, I'd be
a little pissed too


975
00:49:07.545 --> 00:49:09.745
if I was made
a human pinata.


976
00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:14.216
[Nolan laughs]

977
00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:17.786
You know, this whole
thing, the helmet,


978
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:20.589
the training,
using you as bait,


979
00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:22.191
have you ever wondered why

980
00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:25.060
you were so
attracted to the Noblemen?


981
00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:27.663
I don't know, I've
always been a fan.


982
00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:28.997
My dad would
bring something


983
00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.732
every time he'd come
back from business trips


984
00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:31.200
to wherever he went.

985
00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:32.100
Right.

986
00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.535
But he
always took the time


987
00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:35.637
to read you the
stories of the Noblemen.


988
00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:39.641
And after he died, your
mother took up the challenge,


989
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:42.978
the books, the games, they
still kept coming, didn't they?


990
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.246
I guess.

991
00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:46.014
Look, I just
thought she did it because


992
00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:47.015
it reminded me of my dad.

993
00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:55.791
You know, I've already had
my therapy session this month.


994
00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:56.925
We chose you.

995
00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:02.931
The most direct
descendants of Sir Geldemoore


996
00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:04.867
are you and your father.

997
00:50:04.869 --> 00:50:06.602
He knew that
when you grew up


998
00:50:06.604 --> 00:50:09.271
you would take his
place as a Nobleman.


999
00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:13.509
He intended to train
you when you got older,


1000
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:16.011
but he died
before he could.


1001
00:50:18.983 --> 00:50:22.217
You are one of us,
you always have been.


1002
00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:24.786
Your father was
teaching you everything


1003
00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:28.257
so when you became an adult,
you'd be fully prepared.


1004
00:50:34.265 --> 00:50:36.598
Your father died
fighting Lord Dragsmere,


1005
00:50:38.936 --> 00:50:41.637
the same demon
that wants to kill you now.


1006
00:50:45.009 --> 00:50:46.008
That ain't gonna happen.

1007
00:50:47.845 --> 00:50:48.977
[tense music]

1008
00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.846
Hey, man?

1009
00:50:50.848 --> 00:50:53.215
You need something,
forgot you left the stove on


1010
00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:54.983
or something like that?

1011
00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:57.119
His spirit's renewed.

1012
00:50:57.121 --> 00:50:59.922
Ah, okay, right.

1013
00:50:59.924 --> 00:51:02.991
Your mortal enemy, the souls
are connected, all that crap.


1014
00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:04.726
He has
accepted his destiny.


1015
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.930
But I can
sense he's not ready.


1016
00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:09.331
I need to act fast.

1017
00:51:11.302 --> 00:51:12.167
You know,

1018
00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:15.938
I could call some of
my pals in Chinatown.


1019
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.573
Those guys
are real gangsters.


1020
00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:19.641
One time I saw a
dude cut his own finger off


1021
00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:21.677
to prove his loyalty,
his own God damned finger,


1022
00:51:21.679 --> 00:51:23.111
who does that?

1023
00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:25.881
I'll tell you what,
I'll go over there in person,


1024
00:51:25.883 --> 00:51:27.249
and I'll tell
them what you need.


1025
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:28.317
Stay!

1026
00:51:29.687 --> 00:51:30.819
I will need you.

1027
00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:33.655
Yeah, I'm your man.

1028
00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:39.127
I'm just trying to be
of service, no problem.


1029

00:52:15.199 --> 00:52:18.033
Holy shit!

1032
00:52:18.035 --> 00:52:20.235
You're like the
frigging re-animator.


1033
00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:23.872
Are they like
your minions?


1034
00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:26.842
Will they obey your
every command and stuff?


1035
00:52:26.844 --> 00:52:28.810
I am their master,

1036
00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:33.115
my army to destroy the Noblemen,
rule the underworld.


1037
00:52:34.785 --> 00:52:36.284
Why am I not surprised?

[Nolan sighs]

1039
00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:41.890
I don't know about you,

1040
00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:44.359
but I think it's about
time we hit the minibar.


1041
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:46.061
That is a
hell of an idea.


1042
00:52:46.063 --> 00:52:48.697
Whatever you're making,
make mine a double.


1043
00:52:48.699 --> 00:52:49.898
If we're gonna be
stuck in this place,


1044
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.733
we may as well
make the most of it.


1045
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.270
Oh my God,
are they serious?

They've pressed
my jeans and our t-shirts.

Holy crap,
Nol, look at this!


1049
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.747
My crappy,
holey jeans, they ironed them.

[Nolan snoring]

1051

He's
discovering his powers.


1052
00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:28.370
What do we do now?

1053
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.174
Ramp up
Nolan's training.

00:54:02.039 --> 00:54:03.772
Where's Corbin?

1060
00:54:03.774 --> 00:54:05.874
Think fast.
[sword thuds]


1061
00:54:05.876 --> 00:54:07.476
Good.

1062
00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:09.411
Your reflexes will help
you with today's exercise.


1063
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:11.913
You didn't answer my
question, Stonewall.


1064
00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.215
Where's the boss-man?

1065
00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:15.350
Relax, he's in
the command center.


1066
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.025
Here we go.

1067
00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:30.432
I don't like this.

1068
00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:31.900
It's okay.

1069
00:54:31.902 --> 00:54:33.068
Our people have
been training warriors


1070
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:34.369
for hundreds of years.

1071
00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:37.105
It just
seems a little rough.


1072
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:40.008
Well, if you wanna
make an omelet,


1073
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.177
you gotta break some eggs.

1074
00:54:42.179 --> 00:54:43.512
Not if you're the egg.

1075
00:54:45.783 --> 00:54:47.916
[sword scrapes]

1076
00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:49.417
This is sharp.

1077
00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:51.019
Yes, it is.

1078
00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:52.320
Give me that.

1079
00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:56.792
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1080
00:54:56.794 --> 00:55:00.462
Hearkens back to
a more elegant time,


1081
00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:04.366
more brutal,
but more elegant as well.


1082
00:55:04.368 --> 00:55:07.836
You see,
your body armor, your shield,


1083
00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:09.571
are made of a Kevlar
composite and woven titanium.

[Nolan groans]

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.078
See the irony?

1087
00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:22.450
Your armor makes
sword fighting all but obsolete.


1088
00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:24.052
Yeah, but it still
hurts like hell.


1089
00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.187
Oh,
don't worry,


1090
00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:26.955
you'll have some
nasty bruises tomorrow,


1091
00:55:26.957 --> 00:55:28.223
but you won't be dead.

1092
00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:31.092
Well,
that's a plus.


1093
00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:33.295
However, your armor
can only protect you


1094
00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:34.896
from piercing weapons,

1095
00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:37.132
Lord Dragsmere
can still beat you to death.


1096
00:55:37.134 --> 00:55:38.834
Lovely.

1097
00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:39.968
Let's get started.

1098
00:55:45.609 --> 00:55:47.943
Come on,
Nol, kick his ass.


1099
00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:51.046
[feet pounding]

1100
00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:52.480
After you.

1101
00:55:53.417 --> 00:55:54.583
What's down there?

1102
00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:56.151
Today's lesson.

1103
00:55:56.153 --> 00:55:58.987
Today I want you
to focus on defense,


1104
00:55:58.989 --> 00:56:02.390
use the shield,
stay aware of your surroundings.


1105
00:56:05.162 --> 00:56:06.294
[gate crashes]

1106
00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:07.863
What the hell!

1107
00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:09.331
If you had
your helmet on


1108
00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:10.532
you would have
seen that coming.


1109
00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:12.400
I didn't know we
started today's training.


1110
00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:13.935
Today's?

1111
00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.871
Yesterday's never ended.

1112
00:56:15.873 --> 00:56:17.339
From the moment
you woke up on that couch


1113
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:18.473
we've been testing you,

1114
00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:21.276
and so far
you're a failure.


1115
00:56:21.278 --> 00:56:23.278
That's pretty harsh.

1116
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.113
Then prove me wrong.

1117
00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.448
All you have to
do is find the exit.


1118
00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:29.017
You are such a dick.

1119
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.486
A snarky comeback is

1120
00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.154
not gonna get you
out of this one today.


1121
00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:36.191
I'd put that helmet on,
they have body armor too.

Dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick.


1123
00:56:45.202 --> 00:56:46.601
Good luck.

1124
00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:47.669
You're gonna need it.

1125
00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:52.274
What kind
of crap is that?


1126
00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:54.209
The kind of crap
that will end the boy


1127
00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:55.977
and birth the man.

1128

Seriously, poetry?

Just watch, sit down.

Hey guys, come on!

Do we really
have to do this?


1132
00:57:12.496 --> 00:57:13.395
I guess so.

[Corbin] Very good, Nolan,

1145
00:58:02.379 --> 00:58:04.245
you trusted the
helmet to guide you.


1146

What the hell?

1147
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.323
Put your helmet back on.

1148
00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.624
You watching me?

1149
00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:19.194
What is this,
some kind of reality TV show?


1150
00:58:19.196 --> 00:58:21.196
It's all part
of the training.


1151
00:58:21.198 --> 00:58:23.598
Now,
put your helmet back on.


1152
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.000
Okay,
big brother.


1153
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.504
Any other surprises
you wanna tell me about?


1154
00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:32.007
Oh, yes,
that's the fun part.


1155

Is this FART CATCHER
ever gonna learn?

Gabby,
is that you?

See how I kicked

pretty sweet,
huh?

Shut up, dumb ass,

Time out?

There is no time out.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.432
But I lost my shield.

1195

I need a reset.

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:40.735
Then fight without
the shield, Jesus!

And that son of a

He was sentenced to death four
years ago by lethal injection

for killing his wife and
three kids in a daycare center.

Russell here is
actually a rare commodity.

Pure evil is hard to find,

No.

1266
01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:34.629
Corbin was outta his
mind for believing in you.


1267
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.064
This is a
war against evil,


1268
01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.867
and you have to be willing
to do whatever it takes to win.


1269
01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.903
I'm not gonna kill
him, he's chained up.


1270
01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:43.504
It is time for you
to either to shit,


1271
01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:44.639
or get off the pot.

1272

If you can't do this,

1273
01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:48.142
there are others in
your bloodline that will.


1274
01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:50.812
I'm not gonna kill someone
for your stupid cult.


1275
01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:52.847
No way,
man, that's not me.


1276
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:55.817
Thank you, it's
about God damn time.

You hear that?

1278
01:05:57.086 --> 01:06:02.023
Nolan, the monster
in that chair


1279
01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:05.526
is an Apostle of
the Devil himself.


1280
01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:09.497
This is about the
balance of good and evil.

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:26.920
This shit is next level.

1602
01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:32.726
Come on!

1603
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.671
[taser blasts]

1604
01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.817
Heard a lot about
you, Sir Geldemoore.


1605
01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:07.327
Kill him!

1606
01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:12.165
[sword clanks]

1607
01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:19.039

[coins clanking]

1610
01:26:43.098 --> 01:26:43.963
Hey bud!

1611
01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.233
[Blades sighs heavily]

1612
01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:48.301
What's up?

1613
01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:51.738
[Blades yells]

1614
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.040
[club crashes]

1615
01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.749
Vicars, I'm here
to rescue you.


1616
01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.019
Where's the team?

1617
01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:08.288
Just me, I'm a lone
wolf like Chuck Norris.


1618
01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:09.756
You're an idiot.

1619
01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:11.024
And you're an asshole.

1620
01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:15.895
[Vicars] Look out, behind you!

1621
01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.098
[Blades yells]

[chairs crash]

[Nolan groans]

1625
01:27:51.867 --> 01:27:55.368
The heir of the
mighty Lord Geldemoore.


1626
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:58.371
A pitiful
fleck of existence.


1627
01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:00.273
[Nolan] I'm
tougher than I look.


1628
01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:02.275
A thousand years
ago, it took Geldemoore


1629
01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:04.277
and all his
brethren to take me down,


1630
01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.913
and you thought you
could take me on by yourself?


1631
01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:08.815
He's not alone.

1632
01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:10.984
You again!

1633
01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:13.520
[taser guns blast]

[sword crashes]

1639
01:28:32.207 --> 01:28:33.873
You can't take me,

1640
01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:35.842
you don't
have the bloodline.


1641
01:28:35.844 --> 01:28:36.509
But I do!

1642
01:28:38.914 --> 01:28:41.381
[swords crashing]

1643
01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:57.897
Back in your cage,
demon dick face!


1644
01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:26.292
Destiny fulfilled.

1645
01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:28.995
[melancholy music]

1646
01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.139
Are you ready for this?

1647
01:29:41.076 --> 01:29:42.909
Ready as I'll ever be,

1648
01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:45.912
besides isn't it
a little late for that?


1649
01:29:45.914 --> 01:29:48.047
We always have
to stay diligent.


1650
01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.884
Evil cannot be destroyed,
just held at bay.


1651
01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:52.385
Right, eggs break.

1652
01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:54.921
Haven't you
guys ever considered


1653
01:29:54.923 --> 01:29:56.556
a better way of
storing those things?


1654
01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.958
Well, I thought
that a top secret safe


1655
01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.493
with electronic locks
would have done the trick.


1656
01:30:02.097 --> 01:30:04.130
It's just the way
of the universe.


1657
01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:06.399
Evil will
always find a way.


1658
01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:12.538
And, yes, we are looking
into better methods.


1659
01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.608
You ready?

1660
01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.246
Let's do this.

1661
01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:23.349
[totally FREAKIN
EPIC music begins]


1662

Kneel!

1663
01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:54.213
I present you with
the helm of the sky.


1664
01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:14.233
Nolan Parthmore,
son of Daniel and Kathleen,


1665
01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.470
descendant of
Auric Geldemoore,


1666
01:31:19.975 --> 01:31:22.208
it is with great
honor that I dub thee


1667
01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:25.578
Sir Nolan Parthmore,

1668
01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.017
Knight of the Noblemen.

1669
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:38.157
[All] A Nobleman
is sworn to valor.


1670
01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.460
His heart
knows only virtue.


1671
01:31:40.462 --> 01:31:43.096
His blade
defends the innocent.


1672
01:31:43.098 --> 01:31:45.498
His words
speak only truth.


1673
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.500
His wrath
undoes the wicked.

[explosive musical blast]
