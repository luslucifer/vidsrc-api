[lip trilling]

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:18.116
-Hey.
-Hm?


8
00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:19.159
Where's Jack?

9
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:20.202
He'll be here.

10
00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:21.953
Uh!

11
00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:24.289
He'll be here.

12
00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:28.293
[instrumental music]

13
00:01:40.263 --> 00:01:42.307
[mouthing silently]
One, two...

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.187
[instrumental music]

15
00:01:49.064 --> 00:01:50.606
Good morning, Chicagoans,
and thank you


16
00:01:50.648 --> 00:01:52.359
for tuning in
to The Windy City Wake-Up,


17
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:54.819
Chicago's number-one
morning radio show.


18
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.696
I am the dashing Jack Russo...

19
00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:58.114
[mouthing silently]
Sorry.


20
00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:00.325
...and across from me
is my dazzling


21
00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:02.327
partner in crime,
Maggie Quinn.


22
00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.995
Did your voice just crack?
What's happening?


23
00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:06.456
Are you finally hitting puberty
live on the air?


24
00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:08.291
Wow, only thirty seconds in

25
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.709
and I'm already getting
the evil eye.


26
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:11.211
This must be a record.

27
00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:13.004
I don't know if you know this,
Jack, but today


28
00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:16.716
is December 26,
the day after Christmas.


29
00:02:16.758 --> 00:02:19.010
Oh, believe me, my headache and
I are well aware of the date.


30
00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:20.845
Let me guess,
you serenaded your family


31
00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:23.390
until the wee hours of the night
with a private concert?


32
00:02:23.432 --> 00:02:24.849
Listeners, can you believe

33
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.310
he refuses to play for us
live on the air?


34
00:02:27.352 --> 00:02:28.895
You know I have crippling
stage fright, Maggie.


35
00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:30.730
So how was your Christmas?

36
00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:32.441
It was good.
Thank you very much for asking.


37
00:02:32.482 --> 00:02:33.483
I opened presents with my dad,

38
00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:35.026
sister Amanda and her family.

39
00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:37.904
We made an amazing breakfast

40
00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:39.531
and made a snowman outside.

41
00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:41.283
Wow. Sounds like
an after-school special.


42
00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:43.868
-I'm jealous.
-And how was yours?


43
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.828
Did your mom like the new
Crockpot I found on sale?


44
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.748
Shh! Maggie! My mom's listening,
and she thinks I picked it.


45
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.500
I hate to break it to you, Jack,
but your mom knows


46
00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:52.461
that I've been picking out
your Christmas gifts for you


47
00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:55.130
since we were 15. She even
sends me a thank-you card.


48
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.257
-What? Are you serious?
-Mm-hmm.


49
00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.675
I feel betrayed. Next year
she's getting batteries.


50
00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:02.011
[clears throat]
Truth is, I'm more excited


51
00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:04.097
for tonight than
for the actual Christmas Day.


52
00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.891
I can already taste your
sister's freshly-baked goods.


53
00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:09.394
As most of our listeners know,
every December 26th,


54
00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:12.355
Jack's family and my family do
our annual post-Christmas dinner


55
00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:15.024
at The Magnolia,
which both of our fathers own.


56
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:18.403
Yada, yada, yada. The point is,
I am ready to feast.


57
00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:20.863
-[pig snorting]
-[laughing]


58
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:23.533
Are you bringing Serena?

59
00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:25.535
Bring Serena?
I'm not even bringing a salad.


60
00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:27.579
Oh, very nice. 
What a gentleman.

61
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:29.414
I've only been dating her
for three months, I don't wanna


62
00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:32.542
scare the poor girl off.
Are you bringing Hunter?


63
00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:34.710
-I don't wanna rush this one.
-See?


64
00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:37.422
-You're just as scared as I am.
-No, Jack, I'm not scared!


65
00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.966
I'm just, I'm waiting
for the right time.


66
00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:42.385
You've been dating for, what,
six months?


67
00:03:42.427 --> 00:03:44.220
-When is the right time?
-Listeners out there...


68
00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:46.431
Does anyone have any thoughts
on this?


69
00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:50.644
I would say that the nine-month
mark is a sweet spot.


70
00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:52.145
You're stalling.

71
00:03:52.187 --> 00:03:55.023
Ooh, looks like
we have our first caller.


72
00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:57.567
You are live
with Maggie and Jack!


73
00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.361
Jack!

74
00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:04.991
[Maggie] What are you doing?

75
00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:06.326
I slept too late
to pack a lunch.


76
00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:08.244
I know. I covered for you,
remember?


77
00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:11.373
-[clicks tongue] Hm.
-Ah, what is that?


78
00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:13.749
Look like fruitcake from
last week's Christmas party.


79
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:16.294
Jack, no!
That's from over a week ago!


80
00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:17.879
Yeah, but it's fruitcake.

81
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.965
Here. I brought some leftovers
from Christmas dinner.


82
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:23.968
Ooh! Amazing!

83
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.428
The phones were flashing

84
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.971
brighter than a Christmas tree
this morning.


85
00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:29.057
Who knew that meeting
your partner's family


86
00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:30.933
would spark up
such a heated debate?


87
00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:34.145
And here I thought I was
the only one trying to avoid it.


88
00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:37.440
-Besides you, of course.
-[scoffs]


89
00:04:37.482 --> 00:04:39.150
I am not avoiding anything.

90
00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:41.152
Hunter will meet the whole gang
when the time is right.


91
00:04:41.194 --> 00:04:42.820
He's gonna get eaten alive.

92
00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:44.364
Okay, just because you
don't like him doesn't mean


93
00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:45.823
everyone else
is gonna feel the same way.


94
00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:48.784
I like him. It's just...

95
00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:50.662
What?

96
00:04:50.704 --> 00:04:52.539
He wears a lot of sweater vests.

97
00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:54.957
[laughs] Sweater vests,
really? That's all you got?


98
00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.418
It's unsettling.

99
00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:01.005
I think
he's got a deep dark secret.


100
00:05:01.047 --> 00:05:02.382
You are worse than my dad.

101
00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:05.009
You find a reason
to dislike every guy


102
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:07.512
that I have
ever introduced you to.


103
00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:11.057
Or they have failed to find
a reason to be liked by me.


104
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.146
[instrumental music]

105
00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:23.612
Great show today, you guys.

106
00:05:23.653 --> 00:05:26.072
Thanks, Deb. Christmas cookie?

107
00:05:26.114 --> 00:05:27.823
Ooh! Don't mind if I do.

108
00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:30.410
-Good numbers?
-Great numbers.


109
00:05:30.452 --> 00:05:31.745
People are tweeting like crazy

110
00:05:31.785 --> 00:05:33.037
about their own
meet-the-family stories.


111
00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:35.665
Hashtag Windy City Wake-Up
is trending.


112
00:05:35.707 --> 00:05:37.125
-Right on.
-Gets better.


113
00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.543
Judd Crawford
from Satellite Radio


114
00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:40.378
just called.

115
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.465
-Satellite Radio?
-What did they say?


116
00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:46.134
That they're interested
in taking Windy City Wake-Up...


117
00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:49.971
-To a national level!
-Are you kidding me?


118
00:05:50.012 --> 00:05:52.432
Is this a joke, is this like
the time you said Mandy Moore


119
00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:53.683
called the station for a date
with me?


120
00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:55.809
Oh, yeah, that was a good day.

121
00:05:55.851 --> 00:05:58.313
Forget that.
This is amazing news!


122
00:05:58.354 --> 00:05:59.606
You bet it is.

123
00:05:59.648 --> 00:06:00.690
They wanna do a cross-over for

124
00:06:00.732 --> 00:06:02.233
the next five days to see if you

125
00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:04.152
appeal to their audience
before any big moves are made.


126
00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:06.195
-For real? This is amazing!
-Mm-hmm.


127
00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:09.073
-I think I'm speechless.
-That never happens.


128
00:06:09.115 --> 00:06:10.908
No one has chemistry
like you guys.


129
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.453
It's time for the country
to hear what I've always known.


130
00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:16.038
Windy City Wake-Up
is great radio.


131
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.124
-Simple as that.
-Thanks, Deb.


132
00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:20.335
But no matter what,
you are our producer.


133
00:06:20.376 --> 00:06:21.919
-You gotta come with us.
-No question.


134
00:06:21.961 --> 00:06:23.254
Well, then, we better make

135
00:06:23.296 --> 00:06:25.548
these next five days count.

136
00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:29.093
Good job, you two.

137
00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:31.805
Mags, we're going national!

138
00:06:31.845 --> 00:06:33.389
Our chance
to make a real impact.


139
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:35.266
This is what
we've always wanted.


140
00:06:35.308 --> 00:06:36.559
Ever since our ridiculous
high school show.


141
00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:38.394
Lunch Wakeup
With Maggie And Jack.


142
00:06:38.436 --> 00:06:40.438
[whistling]

143
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.774
I think this calls for the best
friends forever power shake.


144
00:06:42.816 --> 00:06:45.485
-Oh, no, Jack, no.
-What? It's the shake.


145
00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:47.028
It marks when we officially
became best friends.


146
00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.405
You're too good for the shake?
Come on.


147
00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:52.408
-Ooh. Phew.
-Ooh. Phew.


148
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.745
-Focus, passion, personality!
-Focus, passion, personality!


149
00:06:55.787 --> 00:06:57.455
-Jack and Maggie forever. Yes!
-Jack and Maggie forever. Yes!


150
00:06:57.497 --> 00:06:58.832
-Bond.
-Bond.


151
00:06:58.873 --> 00:07:00.208
Hey, am I interrupting anything?

152
00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:02.084
Hunter! You're here early.

153
00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:04.796
-Oh, is that, is that a problem?
-No. Of course not.


154
00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:06.339
I like your sweater.
Where'd you get it?


155
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.383
The mall, yeah, uh, the...

156
00:07:08.424 --> 00:07:09.801
They're on sale
'cause Christmas is over.


157
00:07:09.843 --> 00:07:12.220
We should go.
I'll be back in an hour.


158
00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:15.557
Bye.

159
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:21.396
[chuckles]
It's never gonna last.


160
00:07:24.357 --> 00:07:27.736
So, anyway, we're gonna start
doing crossover episodes


161
00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:29.237
beginning tomorrow.

162
00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:31.947
That's, wow,
that's, that's great.


163
00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:34.200
-Uh-oh. What's wrong?
-No, it's, I was...


164
00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:36.411
I was listening to your show
this morning,


165
00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:38.913
and it felt like you and Jack
were making fun of the fact


166
00:07:38.954 --> 00:07:41.624
that Serena and I are
not invited to dinner tonight.


167
00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:45.002
Oh, no, no, no. No. We embellish
things for the show.


168
00:07:45.044 --> 00:07:47.756
And trust me, I want you to meet
the whole Russo-Quinn gang,


169
00:07:47.797 --> 00:07:49.006
but in due time.

170
00:07:49.048 --> 00:07:52.427
But I am warning you,
they're nuts!


171
00:07:52.468 --> 00:07:54.220
But why can't I just meet
your father and your sister?


172
00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:55.555
Wha...

173
00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:59.934
What do the Russos
have to do with us?


174
00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:02.353
Well, you know, our dads
are like a package deal.


175
00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:03.521
We do everything together.

176
00:08:03.563 --> 00:08:04.731
We may not be family by name,

177
00:08:04.773 --> 00:08:06.733
but we are a family.

178
00:08:06.775 --> 00:08:09.736
So if we end up together,

179
00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:14.156
um, you're telling me that
we will be spending the holidays


180
00:08:14.198 --> 00:08:16.701
with Jack's family every time?

181
00:08:16.743 --> 00:08:19.495
This is about Jack, isn't it?

182
00:08:19.537 --> 00:08:21.330
Uh, I mean,
you guys are always texting,


183
00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:22.540
you have
all these inside jokes...


184
00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:24.667
You-you,
you have a secret handshake.


185
00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:26.878
I mean, i-it's a bit strange.

186
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.046
Hunter, like I told you,

187
00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:31.800
Jack and I, we've known
each other our entire lives.


188
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:35.720
If something were to happen,
it would've happened by now.


189
00:08:35.762 --> 00:08:39.265
We're just friends.
I promise you.


190
00:08:39.307 --> 00:08:43.561
You ever, um,
you ever had feelings for him?


191
00:08:44.729 --> 00:08:47.022
No. Of course not.

192
00:08:47.941 --> 00:08:49.442
Okay.

193
00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:53.070
Sweater vest's on point today.

194
00:08:53.112 --> 00:08:56.407
You look incredibly charming.
You look like Superman.


195
00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:58.075
I have a thing for him.

196
00:08:59.076 --> 00:09:02.163
[instrumental music]

197
00:09:07.376 --> 00:09:09.211
You excited to tell everyone
the big news?


198
00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:11.673
Oh, yeah, my dad's
probably gonna be so proud,


199
00:09:11.714 --> 00:09:15.468
he'll break out
the 1967 Chateau Baptiste.


200
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.306
And outshine my 2019 Rose?
He wouldn't dare.


201
00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:25.019
-[sighs]
-You okay? Something wrong?


202
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.355
I don't know, Hunter and I
had a weird conversation today.


203
00:09:27.396 --> 00:09:28.731
About what?

204
00:09:28.773 --> 00:09:31.108
He was bummed
he wasn't invited tonight.


205
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.987
You, too? Serena was not
impressed with our segment.


206
00:09:34.028 --> 00:09:36.364
She made me promise
to invite her next year.


207
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:40.535
Wow. So we're thinking
long-term. That is a first.


208
00:09:40.576 --> 00:09:42.745
Ah. Who knows
what the future holds?


209
00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:46.749
And that is why
you're perpetually single.


210
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:48.710
What? I'm a realist.

211
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:51.838
[instrumental music]

212
00:09:58.219 --> 00:09:59.554
[sighs]

213
00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:00.847
Hm.

214
00:10:02.056 --> 00:10:03.516
Hey, hey.

215
00:10:03.558 --> 00:10:06.143
H-h-hey, my boy. Mwah.

216
00:10:06.185 --> 00:10:09.647
Dad, I just saw you yesterday.

217
00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:13.818
Margaret.
You look ravishing, as always.


218
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.778
-Maggie!
-Hi, dad.


219
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.488
Thank you.

220
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.157
Interesting, uh, show today.

221
00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:22.368
What is this nonsense
about you two being scared


222
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.203
of bringing your partners
to meet us?


223
00:10:24.245 --> 00:10:26.205
Dad, remember when I brought
Bobby Murtho to Thanksgiving?


224
00:10:26.247 --> 00:10:29.333
All that interrogating?
He nearly choked on his turkey.


225
00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:30.835
Probably still needs therapy
after that night.


226
00:10:30.877 --> 00:10:32.921
Now that was
an entertaining Thanksgiving.


227
00:10:32.962 --> 00:10:35.548
-Uh-huh.
-Bobby was a bonehead.


228
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.425
For crying out loud,
he was a Red Sox fan!


229
00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:41.136
-He was from Boston.
-Ah.


230
00:10:41.178 --> 00:10:44.306
-Hi, mom.
-Hi, honey.


231
00:10:44.348 --> 00:10:46.100
Would you put this
on the table?


232
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.062
Is there any potatoes in this,
or is it all just butter?


233
00:10:49.102 --> 00:10:51.814
-Did you ask 'em about the show?
-Oh, come on, mom.


234
00:10:51.856 --> 00:10:53.482
You know you can't take
this stuff personally.


235
00:10:53.524 --> 00:10:55.944
Well, maybe
if you actually did introduce us


236
00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:57.445
to one of your girlfriends,

237
00:10:57.486 --> 00:10:59.447
you would see
that we can behave ourselves.


238
00:10:59.488 --> 00:11:02.157
Uh-uh-uh.
Speak for yourself, Barb.


239
00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.368
-Maggie!
-Oh, hi.


240
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.288
Loved the Crockpot.
You really nailed it this year.


241
00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:09.040
Oh, I'm so glad
that you liked it.


242
00:11:09.082 --> 00:11:11.584
Betrayal. Okay?

243
00:11:11.626 --> 00:11:14.336
-Oh.
-There they are.


244
00:11:14.378 --> 00:11:16.047
Traffic was unbelievable.

245
00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:18.257
How's my favorite guy today?

246
00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:20.175
-Huh?
-I'm good, grandpa!


247
00:11:20.217 --> 00:11:23.345
On a scale of one to ten,
how did Santa do this year?


248
00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:24.973
-Eight-and-a-half.
-Good enough.


249
00:11:25.014 --> 00:11:27.642
Better than last year.
Go give your aunt a hug.


250
00:11:27.683 --> 00:11:29.142
-Hi.
-Hi! Mwah!


251
00:11:29.184 --> 00:11:31.980
So did you hear their radio show
this morning?


252
00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:34.273
No, we missed it. 
What happened?

253
00:11:34.315 --> 00:11:36.275
-Let me ask you something, Matt.
-Yeah.


254
00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:40.153
What was it like meeting Nancy
and me for the first time?


255
00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:41.572
Don't remind me.

256
00:11:41.614 --> 00:11:43.282
Watching the movie
Meet The Parents


257
00:11:43.324 --> 00:11:44.575
felt like
watching a documentary.


258
00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:46.535
[laughing]

259
00:11:46.577 --> 00:11:48.329
[imitating Robert De Niro]
Are you talkin' to me?


260
00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.247
Are you talkin' to me?

261
00:11:50.289 --> 00:11:52.667
-Ooh.
-Okay, listen, everybody.


262
00:11:52.708 --> 00:11:54.877
Maggie and I
have some exciting news.


263
00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:56.921
Oh, let me guess, you've decided

264
00:11:56.963 --> 00:11:58.631
to sell
your baseball card collection


265
00:11:58.673 --> 00:12:00.925
so I can finally clear out
the attic.


266
00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:02.677
Not a chance, mom.
Those cards are an investment.


267
00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:04.971
-Wait and see.
-[Maggie] It's better, okay?


268
00:12:05.013 --> 00:12:07.849
The Windy City
will be airing nationally


269
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.727
on Satellite Radio
starting tomorrow!


270
00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:16.024
Wow, our very own Jackson and
Margaret are gonna be famous!


271
00:12:16.065 --> 00:12:18.943
-You know what this calls for?
-Here it comes.


272
00:12:18.985 --> 00:12:20.862
-A group hug.
-A what?


273
00:12:20.903 --> 00:12:25.867
-Come on. Come on. Come on.
-Group hug!


274
00:12:25.908 --> 00:12:28.911
[instrumental music]

275
00:12:28.953 --> 00:12:32.040
[indistinct chatter]

276
00:12:41.382 --> 00:12:43.801
There. Happy birthday.

277
00:12:43.843 --> 00:12:45.427
-A little gravy?
-Yeah.


278
00:12:45.469 --> 00:12:47.180
Maggie, did you want
some cranberry...


279
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.307
Mm. This is delicious!

280
00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:52.060
You guys have outdone
yourselves.


281
00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:53.686
-Hear, hear.
-Well, thank you.


282
00:12:53.728 --> 00:12:55.437
All credit goes
to my lovely wife.


283
00:12:55.479 --> 00:12:57.606
Uh-huh. Thank you, darling.

284
00:13:00.068 --> 00:13:01.903
I miss Grandma Nancy's stuffing.

285
00:13:01.944 --> 00:13:04.906
-Hm. Me, too, buddy.
-Hm.


286
00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:07.992
Her stuffing
was always the best.


287
00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:11.579
She left big shoes to fill,
but her spirit's always with us.


288
00:13:12.997 --> 00:13:14.207
Yeah.

289
00:13:14.247 --> 00:13:15.541
So how are tickets selling

290
00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:18.044
for the annual
New Year's Eve party?


291
00:13:19.754 --> 00:13:21.505
[clears throat]

292
00:13:22.548 --> 00:13:24.341
What are those looks for?

293
00:13:24.383 --> 00:13:28.054
Oh, come on, let's not talk
business during dinner, huh?


294
00:13:28.096 --> 00:13:30.347
You serious?
You love talking shop.


295
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:33.768
It's fine. People are still
in Christmas-mode.


296
00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:35.561
We'll sell more
in the next few days.


297
00:13:35.603 --> 00:13:38.773
-Yeah.
-They used to sell out in a day.


298
00:13:38.814 --> 00:13:41.150
No, unfortunately,
times are changing.


299
00:13:41.192 --> 00:13:44.486
-Well, should we be worried?
-Not at all.


300
00:13:44.528 --> 00:13:49.491
Now, please, let's enjoy this
delicious dinner. Shall we?


301
00:13:49.533 --> 00:13:52.453
Will you pass the potatoes,
please, if there are any left?


302
00:13:52.494 --> 00:13:54.287
Trade you for the turkey? Or you
can pass your plate around.


303
00:13:54.329 --> 00:13:56.582
It's about 40 pounds,
I don't wanna break my back.


304
00:13:57.499 --> 00:13:58.584
Do you mind? Thank you.

305
00:13:58.626 --> 00:14:01.712
[instrumental music]

306
00:14:03.505 --> 00:14:06.467
-Bye, dad. Mwah.
-Love you so much.


307
00:14:06.508 --> 00:14:09.804
Well, thank you all so much for
the new material for our show.


308
00:14:09.845 --> 00:14:11.639
And, Amanda, thank you so much
for the desserts.


309
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.348
-They were amazing.
-Thanks, sis.


310
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.434
-Mom's famous recipe.
-I helped.


311
00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:18.729
[gasps] That must be why
it's so good.


312
00:14:18.771 --> 00:14:20.314
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.


313
00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:22.984
-See you later.
-Bye, safe journeys.


314
00:14:28.114 --> 00:14:30.825
Dad, what's going on
with the bar?


315
00:14:30.866 --> 00:14:32.367
Ah.

316
00:14:34.328 --> 00:14:36.080
Well, what can I say, kid?

317
00:14:36.122 --> 00:14:39.333
Seems like no one comes out
to listen to live jazz anymore.


318
00:14:39.374 --> 00:14:42.128
This place has been
a Chicago staple since the '30s.


319
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.130
Don't people know that?
I mean...


320
00:14:44.172 --> 00:14:46.632
Every famous jazz musician
who ever lived has played here.


321
00:14:46.674 --> 00:14:49.093
I, I know it, son.

322
00:14:49.135 --> 00:14:53.764
But, well, it may just be
the end of an era.


323
00:15:13.993 --> 00:15:17.079
[instrumental music]

324
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.926
Sam from Cincinnati,
you're on the air.


325
00:15:30.968 --> 00:15:32.720
And what can we help you with
today?


326
00:15:32.761 --> 00:15:34.263
[Sam on phone] Well, I just met
my girlfriend's parents


327
00:15:34.305 --> 00:15:35.681
over Christmas.

328
00:15:35.723 --> 00:15:37.599
Ever since,
she's been really distant.


329
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:38.893
I'm worried
her parents told her


330
00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:40.394
they think she can do better.

331
00:15:40.435 --> 00:15:42.146
You see, this is what
I've been talking about.


332
00:15:42.188 --> 00:15:44.940
Family interfering
with a perfectly good thing.


333
00:15:44.982 --> 00:15:46.901
How long have you guys
been together?


334
00:15:46.942 --> 00:15:48.319
About three months.

335
00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:50.321
What did I tell ya? Too early.

336
00:15:50.363 --> 00:15:52.865
My advice, Sam, is next time
you see her parents,


337
00:15:52.907 --> 00:15:55.076
ask a lot of questions. People
love talking about themselves.


338
00:15:55.117 --> 00:15:56.660
-Well, I sure do.
-And remember...


339
00:15:56.702 --> 00:15:59.538
To treat their daughter
like the princess she is,


340
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.790
that way,
they know you're a gentleman.


341
00:16:01.832 --> 00:16:04.126
[Sam on phone] Huh. Okay.
That's not a bad idea.


342
00:16:04.168 --> 00:16:07.338
Look, Sam, meeting the parents

343
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.716
is like beating Bowser's castle
in Super Mario.


344
00:16:10.758 --> 00:16:13.677
Complete that level,
and the rest is smooth sailing.


345
00:16:13.719 --> 00:16:16.180
-Know what I mean?
-[Sam] Totally. Thanks.


346
00:16:16.222 --> 00:16:18.015
You're welcome, bud. Good luck.

347
00:16:18.057 --> 00:16:20.809
Seriously? That's your advice?

348
00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:23.229
Not everything
has to be complicated.


349
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:25.064
Okay, time
for a quick commercial break.


350
00:16:25.106 --> 00:16:27.066
Don't blow away out there.

351
00:16:27.108 --> 00:16:29.443
The Windy City Wake-Up
will be right back.


352
00:16:31.237 --> 00:16:34.489
-You're a child.
-What? It's good advice.


353
00:16:34.531 --> 00:16:37.410
[instrumental music]

354
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:41.205
Today was great. So many new
callers from all over the place.


355
00:16:41.247 --> 00:16:42.873
I think it was
one of our best shows yet.


356
00:16:42.915 --> 00:16:44.250
Hopefully, Judd Crawford agrees.

357
00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:46.460
Speak of the devil.

358
00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:48.503
Any word from the higher-ups?

359
00:16:49.463 --> 00:16:51.924
Did they like us?

360
00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:53.675
I don't know how
to tell you guys this, but...


361
00:16:53.717 --> 00:16:55.886
Oh, no. They hated us.

362
00:16:55.928 --> 00:16:58.013
No. I'm just being silly.

363
00:16:58.055 --> 00:17:00.933
[giggles]
They loved it!


364
00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:03.311
Not cool, Deb.

365
00:17:03.352 --> 00:17:05.062
In fact, they loved it so much

366
00:17:05.104 --> 00:17:07.315
that they want you two to host
a New Year's Eve segment,


367
00:17:07.356 --> 00:17:09.024
live, on the air,

368
00:17:09.066 --> 00:17:12.236
you'll introduce Serena and
Hunter to both your families.


369
00:17:12.278 --> 00:17:14.905
Uh, they want us to introduce
them to our families?


370
00:17:14.947 --> 00:17:17.199
-On the air?
-On New Year's Eve. Yeah.


371
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:18.909
Isn't that stepping a bit
into their privacy?


372
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:21.912
I just don't think
Hunter would agree to do it.


373
00:17:21.954 --> 00:17:24.123
Jokes aside, I think
it's a little early for me


374
00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:25.707
to take that step with Serena.

375
00:17:25.749 --> 00:17:27.626
Come on, this is national
exposure we're talking


376
00:17:27.668 --> 00:17:29.503
about here, you could reach
millions of people


377
00:17:29.544 --> 00:17:30.879
if this deal goes through.

378
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:34.383
Unless you'd rather stay
local forever.


379
00:17:34.425 --> 00:17:38.304
She's right. This could be
our only chance to go big.


380
00:17:39.638 --> 00:17:41.140
Well, where do they
want us to do it?


381
00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:42.475
They're looking for a venue
that isn't


382
00:17:42.516 --> 00:17:43.976
already sold out for New Year's.

383
00:17:44.018 --> 00:17:45.227
Hold on. This is perfect.

384
00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:46.479
How about we do it
at The Magnolia?


385
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.896
-The Magnolia?
-Yes!


386
00:17:47.938 --> 00:17:49.357
It'll help boost sales
for the club.


387
00:17:49.398 --> 00:17:51.108
It would mean
a lot of free advertising.


388
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.320
-It's a win-win.
-So is that a yes?


389
00:17:55.446 --> 00:17:57.448
-Let's do it.
-What she said.


390
00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.616
Perfect, get confirmation
from Hunter and Serena


391
00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:01.243
by the end of the day.

392
00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:04.372
This is gonna be
the best New Year's ever!


393
00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:06.165
It's all happening, nothing can

394
00:18:06.207 --> 00:18:08.209
get in the way
of our dreams now!


395

Oh. Okay. Ow. Put me down.

-Maggie? Jack?
-What are you two doing here?


399
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:35.944
We need to ask you something.

400
00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:38.780
-Sure. Anything.
-Uh, within reason.


401
00:18:39.698 --> 00:18:41.992
So, what do you think?

402
00:18:42.034 --> 00:18:45.371
The Magnolia will be broadcast
across the whole country.


403
00:18:46.663 --> 00:18:50.334
What do we think? Come on!

404
00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:53.546
Of course we agree!
This is wonderful!

The whole country? Wow,
our prayers have been answered.


406
00:18:57.132 --> 00:19:00.928
Great! We'll call Deb
and tell her you guys are in.


407

Uh, w-w-we gotta take down
these Christmas decorations


408
00:19:03.805 --> 00:19:06.183
and start dolling this place up
for New Year's!

Amen. Let's go find
that New Year's box right now.

This is gonna be
just like the old days!


413
00:19:13.941 --> 00:19:16.068
We should book a headliner.

414
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.280
[sighs]
I love seeing them so excited.


415

00:19:20.614 --> 00:19:22.783
-This is gonna be great.
-Yeah.


417
00:19:22.824 --> 00:19:25.536
Now all we have to do is get
Serena and Hunter to sign on.


418
00:19:25.578 --> 00:19:28.456
We're having dinner at my place
tonight. I'll call you after.

00:19:28.497 --> 00:19:29.998

all day.


425

Um, I'm just getting
a bit worried.


426
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.943
Anyways, I have exciting news,

427
00:19:57.985 --> 00:20:00.821
so call me back.

-Jack, what are you doing here?
-[Jack] We need to talk.

No, I don't know why he's here.
He just showed up.

Hunter,
you're not being rational.


442
00:20:40.027 --> 00:20:41.945
Let's just talk about this.

443
00:20:43.238 --> 00:20:45.491
[Maggie] So that's it?

444
00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:49.036
You've made up your mind,
just like that?

Well, if that isn't
just the cherry on top.

00:21:13.435 --> 00:21:16.021
The cherry on top of what?

with me, too.

This is so bad.

-Yeah.
-Oh, Jack.

Yep.

456
00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:33.581
What kind of person breaks up
with you over the phone?


457
00:21:33.622 --> 00:21:36.750
Everyone knows the two-week
cut-off is for a text break-up


458

and one month
for a call break-up.

I mean, come on.
Man up, Hunter.

Forget about that,
what are we gonna do

about the New Year's Eve show?
We need a plan.


462
00:21:44.592 --> 00:21:46.635
Is that seriously what
you're thinking about right now?

00:21:46.677 --> 00:21:48.262
Yes! This is our big break.

464
00:21:48.303 --> 00:21:50.013
No. You know what?
This is a disaster.


465
00:21:50.055 --> 00:21:52.558
-I need to call Deb A-S-A-P.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


466
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.393
We can't call Deb!

467
00:21:54.435 --> 00:21:56.437
Well, how are we supposed to do
the meet-the-parents segment


468
00:21:56.478 --> 00:21:59.273
if we have no dates
to introduce them to?


469
00:21:59.314 --> 00:22:02.526
We will hire people, actors,

470
00:22:02.568 --> 00:22:04.069
to pretend to be
Hunter and Serena.


471
00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:06.029
-Mm-mm. That's a terrible idea.
-Why?


472
00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:10.492
Hunter's face
is all over my social media.


473
00:22:10.534 --> 00:22:11.868
Right.

474
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.622
[sighs]
I can't believe I'm single.


475
00:22:16.957 --> 00:22:18.166
Again.

476

[instrumental music]

477
00:22:20.628 --> 00:22:21.962
[Jack] How else can we make

478
00:22:22.003 --> 00:22:23.880
the New Year's Eve segment
a home run?


479
00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:27.175
Are you not even sad
about Serena?


480
00:22:27.217 --> 00:22:29.261
Of course,
but if it wasn't meant to be,


481
00:22:29.303 --> 00:22:30.638
it wasn't meant to be.

482
00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:32.222
You know, for two people
that make a living


483
00:22:32.264 --> 00:22:33.974
giving relationship advice,

484
00:22:34.015 --> 00:22:35.808
we're sure not
very good at relationships.


485
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.144
[Jack laughs]

486
00:22:37.185 --> 00:22:39.062
What could possibly be funny
right now?


487
00:22:39.104 --> 00:22:40.897
A fan just tweeted she thinks
you and I should be together,


488
00:22:40.939 --> 00:22:42.691
and it got, like,

489
00:22:42.733 --> 00:22:44.693
Yeah, I know, they've
wanted us to be together


490
00:22:44.735 --> 00:22:46.320
ever since we started.

491
00:22:46.361 --> 00:22:49.490
-That's it.
-What's it?


492
00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:50.616
[imitates explosion]

493
00:22:50.658 --> 00:22:52.660
What if, on New Year's Eve,

494
00:22:52.701 --> 00:22:54.328
you and I surprise the fans

495
00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:56.371
by telling them
that we are together?


496
00:22:56.413 --> 00:22:59.291
W-what? Jack, no!

497
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:03.044
Think, think, think about it.
The fans will go wild.


498
00:23:03.086 --> 00:23:04.588
It'd be front-page news.

499
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.423
We'd get crazy ratings
and the execs would see


500
00:23:06.465 --> 00:23:07.840
how many people
care about our show.


501
00:23:07.882 --> 00:23:09.842
-It's a no-brainer.
-This is insane.


502
00:23:09.884 --> 00:23:11.386
You mean genius?

503
00:23:11.428 --> 00:23:14.431
You're actually serious
about this, aren't you?


504
00:23:14.473 --> 00:23:16.809
Satellite Radio, Maggie.

505
00:23:16.849 --> 00:23:19.227
Okay, but what happens
when they find out it's a lie?


506
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:20.895
They never need to know.

507
00:23:20.937 --> 00:23:23.023
After we go national,

508
00:23:23.064 --> 00:23:24.857
we'll let it slip
that we casually decided


509
00:23:24.899 --> 00:23:26.527
to remain friends.

510
00:23:26.568 --> 00:23:28.903
No, Jack, this is a bad idea.

511
00:23:28.945 --> 00:23:31.114
Maggie, with a national show,

512
00:23:31.156 --> 00:23:34.368
we'd be able to help millions
of people across the country.


513
00:23:34.409 --> 00:23:36.745
Which is what
we've always wanted.


514
00:23:36.787 --> 00:23:38.288
Think of the book deals
we'll get offered.


515
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.207
Okay, now you're getting
ahead of yourself.


516
00:23:40.248 --> 00:23:43.377
And The Magnolia needs it.
There's no getting around that.


517
00:23:43.418 --> 00:23:44.586
I dunno about you,
but I'm not ready to accept


518
00:23:44.628 --> 00:23:46.254
the end of an era.

519
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:50.258
This is crazy.

520
00:23:51.218 --> 00:23:53.886
Mags, you're my best friend.

521
00:23:53.928 --> 00:23:56.473
I wouldn't wanna do this
with anyone else.


522
00:23:57.766 --> 00:23:59.267
Say yes.

523
00:24:01.395 --> 00:24:02.646
Say yes.

524
00:24:03.814 --> 00:24:06.233
Say yes. Come on.

525
00:24:06.274 --> 00:24:09.653
Say it, Maggie.
Let me hear it. Say it.

00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:13.323
-Yes.
-Yes! Yes!

Yes!

[Maggie] Are you sure
she's gonna buy it?


530
00:24:17.536 --> 00:24:19.287
She's known us
a really long time.


531
00:24:19.329 --> 00:24:22.416
I know, I mean, you usually go
for the quirky bookworm


532
00:24:22.457 --> 00:24:24.543
and I usually date...

533
00:24:24.585 --> 00:24:25.669
Sexy and cool?

534
00:24:25.711 --> 00:24:27.128
That's not what I was gonna say.

535
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.339
I can be sexy and cool,
you know?


536
00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:30.507
[chuckles]

537
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:32.133
-Oh, you find that funny?
-No.


538
00:24:32.175 --> 00:24:34.010
It's just that I've known you
for so long


539
00:24:34.052 --> 00:24:36.722
that it's hard to see you
that way.


540
00:24:36.764 --> 00:24:40.809
Well, you better start or else
we're never gonna convince her.


541
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:45.689
Ooh, maybe we should be kissing
when she comes in.


542
00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:49.192
Just get caught in the act?

543
00:24:49.234 --> 00:24:50.652
Kissing?

544
00:24:50.694 --> 00:24:53.238
-Like, on the mouth?
-Yes, on the mouth! Look.


545
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.240
We need her to really believe we
are a couple or else she's never


546
00:24:55.282 --> 00:24:56.949
gonna let us go through
with the New Year's Eve party.


547
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:59.035
Okay, but I need to know
what I'm working with.


548
00:24:59.077 --> 00:25:00.412
Let me smell your breath.

549
00:25:00.454 --> 00:25:01.996
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

Ha. Well?

When was the last time
you brushed your teeth?

This morning,
like a regular person.


553
00:25:11.214 --> 00:25:12.883
Just a peck. No theatrics.

00:25:12.925 --> 00:25:15.051
Of course, just a peck!
I'm not insane!

Well, this whole thing is
insane, and it's your big idea.

00:25:16.762 --> 00:25:19.222
She's coming.

557
00:25:19.264 --> 00:25:20.390
[clears throat]
You ready?


558
00:25:20.432 --> 00:25:21.809
Are you sure about this?

559
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.143
Of course not.

560
00:25:23.184 --> 00:25:24.436
Okay, go.

-What are you guys doing here?
-What's going on?

Oh, we came to meet Deb
to work out the party details...

or were you two just...

00:25:41.954 --> 00:25:43.330
Kissing!

567
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:45.707
Wait, yes!
Yes, they were kissing!


568
00:25:45.749 --> 00:25:47.542
Kissing?
What are you talking about?


569
00:25:47.584 --> 00:25:49.294
What about,
what about Serena and Hunter?


570
00:25:49.336 --> 00:25:52.965
Oh, uh,
it's a long story.


571
00:25:53.005 --> 00:25:55.091
-We broke up with them.
-What?


572
00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:57.009
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?


573

Oh, well, they're in love!

574
00:25:59.471 --> 00:26:02.390
Always knew this day would come.

575
00:26:02.432 --> 00:26:04.100
Is this true?

576
00:26:04.142 --> 00:26:07.103
We've been denying our feelings
for so long,


577
00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:10.482
we just couldn't
push them away any longer.


578
00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:13.109
Mm.

579
00:26:13.151 --> 00:26:15.069
-Yes!
-Ha-ha.


580
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:17.656
-My boy!
-This is amazing!


581
00:26:17.698 --> 00:26:22.118
Incredible! Our listeners
are gonna lose their minds!


582
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.996
Oh, no, that's the thing,
we have to keep it a secret


583
00:26:24.036 --> 00:26:25.455
until the New Year's Eve party.

584
00:26:25.497 --> 00:26:28.291
-No one else can know! Shh!
-Mm. Of course.


585
00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:31.378
Mm. The fans are in
for a big surprise.


586
00:26:31.419 --> 00:26:34.381
You know, I always thought you
two had a thing for each other.


587
00:26:34.422 --> 00:26:39.135
This is wonderful!
This is absolutely wonderful!


588
00:26:39.177 --> 00:26:40.971
We're gonna have to tell
your dad, Maggie.


589
00:26:41.013 --> 00:26:43.181
No, no, no.
We don't have to tell Steve.


590
00:26:43.223 --> 00:26:45.225
-Uh-huh.
-Don't really have to tell him.


591
00:26:45.266 --> 00:26:47.519
Oh, nonsense.
We can't keep this from him.


592
00:26:47.561 --> 00:26:50.564
Meet us at The Magnolia after
work so we could be your backup.


593
00:26:50.605 --> 00:26:53.149
Mm-hmm, a-and I'll pack
my Taser, you know,


594
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:56.068
just in case
things get out of hand.


595
00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:00.782
Ooh. I simply
could not be happier!


596
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.786
Boy, you have made our year.

597
00:27:04.828 --> 00:27:07.079
-Oh, and mine, too!
-Mm-hmm.


598
00:27:07.121 --> 00:27:08.623
-Bye now.
-Bye.


599
00:27:08.665 --> 00:27:10.042
Take care.

600
00:27:10.082 --> 00:27:11.167
-Buh-bye.
-Bye.


601
00:27:11.209 --> 00:27:13.085
-So cute. Bye.
-[Jack] Buh-bye.


602
00:27:14.004 --> 00:27:15.296
What?

603
00:27:21.845 --> 00:27:24.806
Did you see all their faces?

604
00:27:24.848 --> 00:27:27.726
I mean, I've never seen them
so excited.


605
00:27:27.768 --> 00:27:30.854
Wait, wait, wait, what happens
when they find out


606
00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.522
that we've been lying to them?

607
00:27:32.564 --> 00:27:34.274
Well, they don't need
to find out.


608
00:27:34.315 --> 00:27:35.609
After New Year's, we reveal

609
00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.903
we decided
not to risk our friendship.


610
00:27:37.945 --> 00:27:40.488
Uh, I don't know, Jack.

611
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.283
This seems like
a really, really bad idea.


612
00:27:43.324 --> 00:27:44.826
It's fine!

613
00:27:44.868 --> 00:27:46.327
We used to prank our families
all the time.


614
00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:48.246
What's the difference?

615
00:27:48.288 --> 00:27:49.957
Remember that April Fool's Day

616
00:27:49.998 --> 00:27:53.376
when we covered all the bathroom
toilets at The Magnolia


617
00:27:53.418 --> 00:27:54.920
with plastic wrap?

618
00:27:54.962 --> 00:27:58.506
-Your dad turned into the Hulk.
-Exactly.


619
00:27:58.548 --> 00:28:00.467
He's gonna kill me, isn't he?

620
00:28:11.436 --> 00:28:13.605
Dad, are you okay?

621
00:28:16.984 --> 00:28:18.318
Dad...

622
00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:21.029
Steve, don't be hasty.

623
00:28:21.989 --> 00:28:23.740
[grunts]

624
00:28:23.782 --> 00:28:28.829
It's time to crack open
the 1967 Chateau Baptiste!


625
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.455
Let's celebrate!

626
00:28:30.497 --> 00:28:33.374
-Ah.
-Yay!


627
00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:36.169
-Oh.
-Oh, it's a Jack sandwich.


628
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.421
Yeah. Okay, dad. Okay, okay.

629
00:28:40.757 --> 00:28:41.758
Yeah.

630
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.135
[instrumental music]

631
00:28:45.345 --> 00:28:48.181
So you just realized,
at exactly the same time,


632
00:28:48.222 --> 00:28:49.975
you had feelings
for one another?


633
00:28:50.017 --> 00:28:52.686
Yeah. Pretty much.

634
00:28:52.727 --> 00:28:54.980
-Oh, it's fate.
-So who made the first move?


635
00:28:55.022 --> 00:28:56.690
-Jack.
-Maggie.


636
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:58.316
Well, w-who was it?

637
00:28:58.358 --> 00:28:59.526
-Me.
-Me.


638
00:29:00.443 --> 00:29:02.654
[chuckling]

639
00:29:02.696 --> 00:29:05.157
The truth is, it was both of us.

640
00:29:05.198 --> 00:29:07.034
One night we were working late
at the studio


641
00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:09.494
and decided to order a pizza,
and the next thing you know


642
00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:11.788
we are making out
like two ravenous animals.


643
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.373
Okay, relax. They get the point.

644
00:29:13.414 --> 00:29:16.417
Okay.
Let's get you to pop this.


645
00:29:16.459 --> 00:29:18.211
Oh, no, no, no, dad,
don't waste that on us.


646
00:29:18.252 --> 00:29:20.755
-It's not like we got engaged.
-Yeah.


647
00:29:20.797 --> 00:29:22.298
I don't really feel comfortable
opening it.


648
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.051
It's far too expensive.

649
00:29:24.092 --> 00:29:28.180
Well, we, we have all been
waiting many years


650
00:29:28.221 --> 00:29:29.806
for this day.

651
00:29:29.848 --> 00:29:32.809
Unless your intentions
with my daughter aren't pure.


652
00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:35.353
No, no. They are,
they are definitely pure.


653
00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:39.649
-Then pop it open, son!
-Yeah, okay.


654
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:41.526
-Yes.
-Mm...


655
00:29:41.568 --> 00:29:44.654
[cheering]

656
00:29:48.282 --> 00:29:50.035
-It's open.
-It's open.


657
00:29:50.077 --> 00:29:51.411
[Jack] Great.

658
00:29:53.955 --> 00:29:57.584
[Maggie] My dad had been saving
that wine for five decades!


659
00:29:57.625 --> 00:30:01.588
If he finds out that we wasted
it on a lie, we are both dead.


660
00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:04.716
He can never know.
I'll marry you if I have to.


661
00:30:04.758 --> 00:30:06.176
Oh, how romantic.

662
00:30:06.218 --> 00:30:08.469
Did you have any clue
that everyone


663
00:30:08.511 --> 00:30:10.764
wanted us to be together
so badly?


664
00:30:10.805 --> 00:30:13.058
No, none, although I did hear
my mom say something to my dad


665
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.517
back in the day, but...

666
00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.603
[scoffs]
That was dumb.


667
00:30:16.644 --> 00:30:18.521
What did she say?

668
00:30:18.563 --> 00:30:21.649
Remember when I signed up
for the school talent show


669
00:30:21.691 --> 00:30:23.484
to play that stupid song
I wrote?


670
00:30:23.526 --> 00:30:26.529
Mm-hmm. But it wasn't stupid.

671
00:30:26.571 --> 00:30:28.990
And remember how even more
stupid, I decided to practice


672
00:30:29.032 --> 00:30:30.742
in front of you all
at The Magnolia?


673
00:30:30.784 --> 00:30:32.702
Mm-hmm. My dad filmed it.

674
00:30:32.744 --> 00:30:34.621
Yeah, that fact haunts me
to this day.


675
00:30:34.662 --> 00:30:38.041
Anyway, that night
I heard my mom say to my dad


676
00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:39.667
that the way
you were looking at me


677
00:30:39.709 --> 00:30:41.335
was the same way
your mom looked at your dad


678
00:30:41.377 --> 00:30:43.880
when he played back in the day.

679
00:30:43.922 --> 00:30:45.757
Oh.

680
00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:49.010
Like I said, always trying to
make something out of nothing.


681
00:30:53.306 --> 00:30:54.975
Well, I did always love
hearing you play,


682
00:30:55.016 --> 00:30:56.643
mostly for your off-beat lyrics,

683
00:30:56.684 --> 00:30:59.520
so she was right
about that part.


684
00:30:59.562 --> 00:31:01.481
That was a long time ago.

685
00:31:05.944 --> 00:31:09.030
I really wish
that you'd kept playing, Jack.


686
00:31:09.072 --> 00:31:11.116
No way.

687
00:31:11.158 --> 00:31:13.618
After running off-stage in
the middle of the talent show?


688
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.329
Did you know how embarrassing
that was?


689
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.166
I'll stick to karaoke
with friends.


690
00:31:19.207 --> 00:31:21.501
Well, that's a shame,

691
00:31:21.542 --> 00:31:23.920
because I think
that you were really good.


692
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:30.969
Well, anyway, I better go.

693
00:31:31.011 --> 00:31:33.680
We have an early morning again.

694
00:31:40.394 --> 00:31:42.438
[Maggie giggles]

695
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.316
Goodnight, Jack.

696
00:31:44.357 --> 00:31:46.234
[laughs]

697
00:31:56.536 --> 00:31:57.871
[sighs]

698
00:32:00.332 --> 00:32:02.709
[Maggie] And don't forget,
tickets go on sale today at noon


699
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.502
for our New Year's Eve
meet-the-parents party


700
00:32:04.544 --> 00:32:05.628
at The Magnolia.

701
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.047
Come hang out with Maggie and me

702
00:32:07.088 --> 00:32:10.424
as we introduce
our significant others on-air


703
00:32:10.466 --> 00:32:11.425
to our crazy families.

704
00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:12.844
Who knows how it'll go!

705
00:32:12.886 --> 00:32:14.470
Party starts at 8:00
with music, food,


706
00:32:14.512 --> 00:32:16.890
drinks and fun to follow.

707
00:32:16.931 --> 00:32:18.474
Live from Chicago,
The Windy City Wake-Up


708
00:32:18.516 --> 00:32:19.559
With Jack And Maggie

709
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.477
is signing off. So remember.

710
00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.771
-Don't blow away out there.
-Don't blow away out there.


711
00:32:25.023 --> 00:32:26.440
[knocking on door]

712
00:32:26.482 --> 00:32:29.110
Hey, hey, hey.
I've got great news.


713
00:32:29.152 --> 00:32:32.530
Judd Crawford called and invited
you two to a cocktail reception.


714
00:32:32.572 --> 00:32:34.241
-Tomorrow night.
-Wait-wait. We...


715
00:32:34.282 --> 00:32:37.160
We're gonna meet Judd Crawford?
He's a radio icon!


716
00:32:37.202 --> 00:32:38.828
[Deb] He's happy
with the numbers on his end


717
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.373
and he wants to meet you.

718
00:32:41.414 --> 00:32:43.750
I think
my heart just skipped a beat.


719
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:46.961
[laughs] Plus, I told him
your little secret


720
00:32:47.003 --> 00:32:48.629
and he's absolutely thrilled,
so...


721
00:32:48.671 --> 00:32:51.341
You told him? It was supposed
to be a surprise.


722
00:32:51.383 --> 00:32:53.260
Oh, trust me, someone like
Judd Crawford doesn't want


723
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:55.511
any surprises, he's more
than happy with the news,


724
00:32:55.553 --> 00:32:58.181
and he thinks it's gonna have
everybody buzzing.


725
00:32:58.223 --> 00:33:00.516
The Judd Crawford thinks we're
gonna have everybody buzzing?


726
00:33:00.558 --> 00:33:02.102
This is a really big deal.

727
00:33:02.143 --> 00:33:06.106
Also, take a look at the posters
for the party.


728
00:33:06.147 --> 00:33:08.066
Jeff plastered them
all over the city this morning


729
00:33:08.108 --> 00:33:09.859
and Judd and his team
are pushing it


730
00:33:09.901 --> 00:33:12.486
all across their social media.
Tickets are gonna sell fast.


731
00:33:12.528 --> 00:33:14.989
Um, it says here there's going
to be a live video stream


732
00:33:15.031 --> 00:33:16.657
of the event on their website?

733
00:33:16.699 --> 00:33:20.578
Yes, they decided that they
wanted to hear and see you


734
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.496
all across the country.

735
00:33:24.791 --> 00:33:26.626
Is that a problem?

736
00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:28.211
No, of course not.

737
00:33:28.253 --> 00:33:31.714
-Sounds good. Anything for Judd.
-Exactly.


738
00:33:33.091 --> 00:33:34.217
[laughs]

739
00:33:38.346 --> 00:33:40.432
-That's good. That's good.
-Yeah, it's huge.


740
00:33:40.473 --> 00:33:43.059
[instrumental music]

741
00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:54.737
I'm still in shock.
Judd Crawford.


742
00:33:54.779 --> 00:33:56.406
What do you think I should wear?

743
00:33:56.448 --> 00:33:59.409
Since when do you care what
someone thinks of your outfit?


744
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:02.203
Uh, since Judd Crawford
personally invited us


745
00:34:02.245 --> 00:34:03.997
to one of his parties.

746
00:34:04.038 --> 00:34:07.292
I mean, aren't you excited?
He'd be our new boss soon.


747
00:34:08.709 --> 00:34:10.086
Maggie?

748
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.050
Maggie! Wait, wait, Maggie!

749
00:34:20.472 --> 00:34:22.474
We've only been broken up
for two days


750
00:34:22.515 --> 00:34:24.809
and he's already out
with another woman.


751
00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:26.978
This coffee shop was our spot!

752
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.981
Um, maybe she's just a friend.

753
00:34:34.486 --> 00:34:36.279
Am I that easily replaced?

754
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:38.614
No, of course not! Listen to me.

755
00:34:38.656 --> 00:34:40.741
You're one a kind, Quinn.

756
00:34:43.036 --> 00:34:44.245
I gotta go clear my head.

757
00:34:44.287 --> 00:34:48.041
Maggie, wait. Come on.

758
00:34:48.082 --> 00:34:51.169
[instrumental music]

759
00:35:11.731 --> 00:35:13.107
[knocking on door]

760
00:35:28.498 --> 00:35:30.708
-Surprise!
-What are you doing here?


761
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.253
We're going to your
favorite spot. Maple Hill.


762
00:35:33.294 --> 00:35:36.506
And I have a thermos full
of hot chocolate in my backpack.


763
00:35:36.548 --> 00:35:39.008
[groaning]
I'm not in the mood.


764
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:41.302
Too bad, I'm not gonna let you
mope around the rest of the day


765
00:35:41.344 --> 00:35:42.887
just because of lame-o Hunter.

766
00:35:42.929 --> 00:35:44.972
-Get your coat. We goin'.
-Jack.


767
00:35:45.014 --> 00:35:48.893
Come on, this very sled,
if it could talk, would recount


768
00:35:48.935 --> 00:35:52.146
endless tales of us hurling down
the mountain, effortlessly,


769
00:35:52.188 --> 00:35:55.358
except for that one day, after
my admittedly amazing jump,


770
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.653
when I broke my arm and you
pulled me, on this same sled,


771
00:35:59.695 --> 00:36:02.865
two hours to the hospital.
You remember that?


772
00:36:02.907 --> 00:36:05.618
Fine. But no jumps.

00:44:55.731 --> 00:45:00.277
-Doesn't it?
-Yeah, it really does.


930
00:45:02.905 --> 00:45:06.700
I'm hungry. Do you wanna go
to The Magnolia for a snack?


931
00:45:06.742 --> 00:45:10.579
I'll make
home-made Hawaiian pizza.


932
00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:12.915
My favorite.

933
00:45:12.957 --> 00:45:15.042
Request Uber now.

934
00:45:15.084 --> 00:45:16.794
Requesting.

935
00:45:37.982 --> 00:45:41.527
Mm. Can you believe New Year's
Eve is the day after tomorrow?


936
00:45:42.444 --> 00:45:44.363
I know.

937
00:45:44.404 --> 00:45:46.866
The place looks so good.

938
00:45:46.907 --> 00:45:49.618
My mom would be
really impressed.


939
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.287
Five years tomorrow, right?

940
00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:54.205
Yeah.

941
00:45:54.247 --> 00:45:56.834
Family dinners
aren't the same without her.


942
00:45:56.876 --> 00:46:00.420
She's the only one who laughed
at my terrible jokes.


943
00:46:00.462 --> 00:46:03.465
She always had a soft spot
for you.


944
00:46:04.925 --> 00:46:07.511
-So your place or mine?
-What?


945
00:46:07.553 --> 00:46:10.973
For your annual in memoriam
tradition to honor your mom.


946
00:46:13.517 --> 00:46:14.894
Definitely mine.

947
00:46:14.935 --> 00:46:17.146
[chuckles] Your place
is terrible for snacks.


948
00:46:17.188 --> 00:46:19.815
True. Okay then.

949
00:46:19.857 --> 00:46:21.316
Seven o'clock, tomorrow night,

950
00:46:21.358 --> 00:46:25.571
your place
for It's A Wonderful Life.


951
00:46:25.612 --> 00:46:27.740
I can't wait.

952
00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:30.201
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.


953
00:46:32.203 --> 00:46:33.453
Good.

954
00:46:36.415 --> 00:46:38.542
So are you feeling any better
about Hunter?


955
00:46:38.584 --> 00:46:41.628
To be honest, I haven't
really thought about him


956
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.589
since we went sledding.

957
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:45.758
Mission accomplished!

958
00:46:45.799 --> 00:46:48.468
What about you? Serena?

959
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:53.140
Nothing ever seems
to bother you. I-I don't get it.


960
00:46:53.182 --> 00:46:55.517
Honestly,
I knew it wasn't gonna last.


961
00:46:55.559 --> 00:46:58.187
If you're not in love,
it's easy to get over it.


962
00:46:58.229 --> 00:47:00.271
Your heart's not broken.

963
00:47:00.313 --> 00:47:02.399
Have you ever had
your heart broken?


964
00:47:03.316 --> 00:47:05.945
Like, truly broken?

965
00:47:05.986 --> 00:47:08.114
When Bianca Bell broke up with
me that summer before college,


966
00:47:08.155 --> 00:47:10.074
I was pretty devastated.
Remember that?


967
00:47:10.116 --> 00:47:11.825
Yeah. You stayed in bed
for two weeks.


968
00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:13.619
I practically
had to force-feed you.


969
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.370
[both laughing]

970
00:47:18.289 --> 00:47:20.751
We've been through a lot
together, haven't we?


971
00:47:20.793 --> 00:47:22.211
Yeah.

972
00:47:23.378 --> 00:47:25.131
Almost everything.

973
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:32.512
How about you? You ever
had your heart truly broken?


974
00:47:33.847 --> 00:47:35.266
Once.

975
00:47:36.558 --> 00:47:38.351
Who?

976
00:47:38.393 --> 00:47:42.481
Not Hunter.
Was it Bobby? Bobby?


977
00:47:42.522 --> 00:47:44.066
It doesn't matter.

978
00:47:44.984 --> 00:47:48.319
It's in the past.

979
00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:50.948
Whoever they are, they're
stupid for letting you go.


980
00:47:58.038 --> 00:47:59.372
Cheers.

981
00:48:00.499 --> 00:48:03.252
-To...
-A wonderful life.


982
00:48:03.294 --> 00:48:06.588
Oh, a wonderful life it is,
indeed.


983
00:48:10.425 --> 00:48:13.053
[Jack] What are you
laughing about?


984
00:48:13.095 --> 00:48:16.890
-Well...
-What? Tell me.


985
00:48:16.932 --> 00:48:20.519
Okay, uh, I've actually
never had a midnight kiss


986
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.188
on New Year's before.

987
00:48:22.229 --> 00:48:25.191
What? Really? Never?

988
00:48:25.232 --> 00:48:26.942
I'm gonna be your first?

989
00:48:26.984 --> 00:48:29.360
-The pressure!
-I know. No kidding.


990
00:48:29.402 --> 00:48:33.157
And in front of so many people?
I'm terrified.


991
00:48:33.199 --> 00:48:35.575
-Well, maybe we should...
-What?


992
00:48:35.617 --> 00:48:37.619
Never mind. It's a dumb idea.

993
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:40.122
No, say it.

994
00:48:40.164 --> 00:48:44.793
Maybe we should practice
so it doesn't seem forced.


995
00:48:44.835 --> 00:48:46.045
Oh.

996
00:48:47.462 --> 00:48:50.549
Ah, like I said,
it's a dumb idea.


997
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:52.718
Well, you... I don't know.

998
00:48:52.759 --> 00:48:56.555
We don't want it to look,
um, awkward.


999
00:48:57.973 --> 00:48:59.308
Exactly.

1000
00:49:02.561 --> 00:49:04.897
-[car honks]
-[Jack laughs]


1001
00:49:04.938 --> 00:49:07.816
So sorry. Oh, no.

1002
00:49:07.858 --> 00:49:10.277
That was incredibly graceful.

1003
00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:12.571
Maybe we should just wait
for New Year's


1004
00:49:12.612 --> 00:49:14.073
and let the magic happen.

1005
00:49:14.114 --> 00:49:17.492
-Jack, stop. Ew!
-I'll walk you home.


1006
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:34.634
This place is gonna
look amazing.


1007
00:49:35.928 --> 00:49:39.056
Hey, where's Jack?
It's almost 4:30.


1008
00:49:39.098 --> 00:49:40.807
Oh, he lives
on his own schedule.


1009
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:43.727
He'll be here, he always
shows up when he's needed.


1010
00:49:43.769 --> 00:49:45.979
Why do you keep on asking
about Jack?


1011
00:49:46.021 --> 00:49:47.356
-I need his help with something.
-Well...


1012
00:49:47.398 --> 00:49:49.149
Is there something
I can help you with?


1013
00:49:49.191 --> 00:49:50.943
-[Jack] Hey...
-Speak of the devil!


1014
00:49:50.984 --> 00:49:53.570
Jack, Steve needs your help
with something.


1015
00:49:53.612 --> 00:49:57.032
-Sure, no problem. With what?
-Follow me.


1016
00:49:57.074 --> 00:49:59.785
I need you to get the box
of extra champagne flutes


1017
00:49:59.826 --> 00:50:01.161
from my car.

1018
00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:04.164
Okay?

1019
00:50:04.206 --> 00:50:06.583
I could have helped him
with that.


1020
00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:08.168
-[gasps]
-Ta-da!


1021
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.338
-Let there be light, he said.
-Aha!


1022
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.048
-Well done.
-Thank you.


1023
00:50:23.016 --> 00:50:24.059
-This it?
-That's it.


1024
00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:26.728
-Okay.
-Hold on.


1025
00:50:28.063 --> 00:50:29.815
Yeah?

1026
00:50:29.856 --> 00:50:32.359
I need to talk to you
about something.


1027
00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:34.194
Look, my dad told me.

1028
00:50:34.236 --> 00:50:36.780
I know this New Year's Eve
party needs to be a success


1029
00:50:36.822 --> 00:50:38.615
or by this time next year
The Magnolia's gonna be


1030
00:50:38.657 --> 00:50:40.826
a new high-rise. But listen,
I'm not gonna let that happen.


1031
00:50:40.867 --> 00:50:43.745
No, no, no, no.
Don't, don't worry about that.


1032
00:50:43.787 --> 00:50:45.622
What's up?
Is everything all right?


1033
00:50:45.664 --> 00:50:49.168
Jack, I know you and Maggie
have only been going steady


1034
00:50:49.209 --> 00:50:51.170
for a-a short while...

1035
00:50:52.629 --> 00:50:56.300
but it means a great deal
for the family


1036
00:50:56.342 --> 00:50:59.510
to see you two together
after all these years.


1037
00:51:01.096 --> 00:51:04.850
Nancy always thought
you two were meant to be.


1038
00:51:06.018 --> 00:51:08.187
-She would be so happy.
-Steve, wait.


1039
00:51:08.228 --> 00:51:09.562
I think I need to tell you
something--


1040
00:51:09.604 --> 00:51:12.607
Hold on.
Just let me get through this.


1041
00:51:12.649 --> 00:51:16.862
I know this is premature,
but I want you to know


1042
00:51:16.903 --> 00:51:19.990
that when the time comes...

1043
00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:24.995
you have my full blessing.

1044
00:51:25.912 --> 00:51:27.498
Is this...

1045
00:51:27.538 --> 00:51:29.540
It was Nancy's.

1046
00:51:29.582 --> 00:51:31.751
She'd want you to have it.

1047
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:36.423
-I can't take this.
-Yes, you can.


1048
00:51:46.016 --> 00:51:48.685
What if
we don't end up together?


1049
00:51:48.727 --> 00:51:50.937
Come on.

1050
00:51:50.979 --> 00:51:54.107
I see the way
you two look at one another.


1051
00:51:54.149 --> 00:51:57.944
It's real. You'd both be fools
to ever let that go.


1052
00:52:01.198 --> 00:52:04.743
You're a good man, Jack.

1053
00:52:04.784 --> 00:52:08.288
There is no one else
I'd rather see my daughter with.


1054
00:52:13.001 --> 00:52:15.212
Don't forget that box.

1055
00:52:15.254 --> 00:52:18.340
[instrumental music]

1056
00:52:40.237 --> 00:52:41.654
[door shuts]

1057
00:52:48.245 --> 00:52:50.330
Jack, can you grab that ladder
and help me hang


1058
00:52:50.372 --> 00:52:51.873
some of these decorations?

1059
00:52:51.915 --> 00:52:54.667
Actually,
I-I'm not feeling very well.


1060
00:52:54.709 --> 00:52:56.128
I think I'm gonna skip out.

1061
00:52:56.169 --> 00:52:58.755
-But you just got here.
-Yeah, yeah, I know.


1062
00:52:58.797 --> 00:53:02.384
I think I just need to lie down
a little while.


1063
00:53:02.426 --> 00:53:03.843
Okay.

1064
00:53:03.885 --> 00:53:07.306
See you at... 7:00.

1065
00:53:15.855 --> 00:53:18.942
[instrumental music]

1066
00:53:31.997 --> 00:53:34.249
Oh, I'm so sorry...

1067
00:53:34.291 --> 00:53:36.627
-Jack?
-Bianca?


1068
00:53:37.794 --> 00:53:39.588
Jack!

1069
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:43.091
Hey! Hi.
What are you doing here?


1070
00:53:43.133 --> 00:53:45.260
I thought you lived
in San Francisco.


1071
00:53:45.302 --> 00:53:46.512
Uh, no, no, not anymore.

1072
00:53:46.553 --> 00:53:49.222
I actually got transferred
this summer.


1073
00:53:49.264 --> 00:53:51.016
I listen to your show
all the time.


1074
00:53:51.057 --> 00:53:52.725
You're quite
the local celebrity.


1075
00:53:52.767 --> 00:53:54.727
What? You listen?

1076
00:53:54.769 --> 00:53:57.189
-That's flattering.
-Yeah, you're hilarious.


1077
00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.775
It kinda reminds me why I had
a crush on you in high school.


1078
00:54:00.817 --> 00:54:02.944
[chuckles]
Right.


1079
00:54:02.986 --> 00:54:04.655
Uh, so are you really gonna

1080
00:54:04.695 --> 00:54:07.324
introduce your girlfriend to
your family live tomorrow night?


1081
00:54:07.366 --> 00:54:09.451
Oh, actually, we broke up.

1082
00:54:09.493 --> 00:54:11.411
We're gonna surprise the fans
with something else.


1083
00:54:11.453 --> 00:54:15.832
You're kidding. Well, in that
case, do you wanna grab a drink?


1084
00:54:15.874 --> 00:54:19.419
-Catch up?
-Oh, um, I don't know.


1085
00:54:19.461 --> 00:54:22.548
Come on! Our favorite place
is right around the corner.


1086
00:54:24.216 --> 00:54:25.967
Okay, sure. Yeah.

1087
00:54:26.009 --> 00:54:29.221
-Just for a bit.
-Okay, great. Okay.


1088
00:54:29.262 --> 00:54:31.264
-Great.
-Let's go.


1089
00:54:31.306 --> 00:54:34.393
[instrumental music]

1090
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:55.955
[laughs] Do you remember
that time


1091
00:54:55.997 --> 00:54:57.374
when you saw...

1092
00:54:57.416 --> 00:54:59.125
[laughs]
How could I forget?


1093
00:54:59.167 --> 00:55:01.378
Just running through the halls
in my underwear.


1094
00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.464
Oh, and to think that
I asked you to prom after that.


1095
00:55:04.506 --> 00:55:07.676
-What were you thinking?
-I wasn't, clearly.


1096
00:55:07.718 --> 00:55:10.303
I always felt kinda bad
about that.


1097
00:55:10.345 --> 00:55:11.888
-About what?
-Well...


1098
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:13.724
Asking you to prom
even though I knew


1099
00:55:13.764 --> 00:55:15.808
you had a pact with Maggie
to go with her.


1100
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:18.228
-I forgot about that.
-Yeah.


1101
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:20.689
I kinda heard her crying
in the girls' washroom


1102
00:55:20.731 --> 00:55:22.482
after you asked her
if it was okay


1103
00:55:22.524 --> 00:55:24.067
if you went with me instead.

1104
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:26.570
Maggie? She was upset?

1105
00:55:26.612 --> 00:55:28.363
Of course she was!
Are you that daft?


1106
00:55:28.405 --> 00:55:30.781
-She was in love with you.
-We were just friends.


1107
00:55:30.823 --> 00:55:32.618
She said it was totally fine
that I went with you.


1108
00:55:32.659 --> 00:55:34.578
You are so naive.

1109
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.372
Have you not figured out
why I broke up with you?


1110
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:42.001
It's because I could tell
you loved her, too.


1111
00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.005
What are you talking about?

1112
00:55:46.047 --> 00:55:47.966
Come on, you know that song
you were supposed to play


1113
00:55:48.007 --> 00:55:51.010
at the school talent show?
It was about her.


1114
00:55:51.052 --> 00:55:52.803
No, it wasn't.

1115
00:55:52.845 --> 00:55:55.932
Um, yes,
it was obviously about her.


1116
00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:58.518
I found the lyrics on your desk.

1117
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.228
How is Maggie, uh, by the way?

1118
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.147
I heard that her mom died
a few years ago.


1119
00:56:02.188 --> 00:56:04.815
-Oh, no.
-Wait, what-what's wrong?


1120
00:56:04.857 --> 00:56:08.654
-What time is it?
-It's a quarter to eight. Why?


1121
00:56:08.695 --> 00:56:11.406
I'm so, so sorry. I have to go.

1122
00:56:11.448 --> 00:56:14.701
I completely forgot about
something. I'm such an idiot.


1123
00:56:14.743 --> 00:56:16.202
-Bye.
-Um...


1124
00:56:22.875 --> 00:56:25.044
Maggie! Please!

1125
00:56:26.212 --> 00:56:29.007
[Jack] Please! Maggie!

1126
00:56:30.967 --> 00:56:32.469
[sighs]

1127
00:56:35.096 --> 00:56:37.974
Maggie, I'm so, so sorry.

1128
00:56:38.016 --> 00:56:39.309
I-I wasn't
thinking straight today


1129
00:56:39.351 --> 00:56:42.437
and I totally lost track
of time.


1130
00:56:42.479 --> 00:56:45.816
Jack, it's late. I need
to go to sleep. Just go home.


1131
00:56:45.856 --> 00:56:49.110
Please. Maggie!
Maggie, I'm sorry!


1132
00:56:49.152 --> 00:56:51.279
I'm-I'm so sorry,
but I'm ready now.


1133
00:56:51.321 --> 00:56:54.783
Let's, uh, let's order food and
watch It's A Wonderful Life.


1134
00:56:54.825 --> 00:56:58.161
We have a show to do in the
morning before our big party.


1135
00:56:58.203 --> 00:57:01.707
Or did you forget about that
as well?


1136
00:57:01.748 --> 00:57:05.585
-How can I make this up to you?
-You should just leave.


1137
00:57:05.627 --> 00:57:08.714
Can we talk about this? Please?

1138
00:57:14.177 --> 00:57:17.055
What were you doing tonight that
made you forget about our plans?


1139
00:57:17.096 --> 00:57:19.098
Oh. Uh...

1140
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.644
It's, uh, it's kind of
a funny story, actually.


1141
00:57:22.686 --> 00:57:25.438
I ended up bumping into Bianca.

1142
00:57:26.773 --> 00:57:29.776
Bianca Bell, from high school?

1143
00:57:29.818 --> 00:57:32.779
Yeah, and we grabbed a bite
to catch up and then--


1144
00:57:32.821 --> 00:57:36.491
Fool me once, shame on you.

1145
00:57:36.533 --> 00:57:40.995
Fool me twice, shame on me.

1146
00:57:41.037 --> 00:57:43.790
What?
What are you talking about?


1147
00:57:43.832 --> 00:57:45.876
I think you should go, Jack.

1148
00:57:45.917 --> 00:57:49.421
Is this about prom?
Maggie, I didn't know...


1149
00:57:49.462 --> 00:57:51.464
I would never do something
like that to you again.


1150
00:57:51.506 --> 00:57:53.759
-You just did!
-[Jack] This is different.


1151
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.427
No, Jack, it's not.

1152
00:57:55.468 --> 00:57:58.471
Jack, you have been doing this
to me our whole lives.


1153
00:57:58.513 --> 00:58:00.849
Putting me second,
taking advantage of the fact


1154
00:58:00.891 --> 00:58:03.142
that you know that I will do
anything for you


1155
00:58:03.184 --> 00:58:04.519
at the drop of a hat.

1156
00:58:04.561 --> 00:58:06.438
That's not true.
You're my best friend.


1157
00:58:06.479 --> 00:58:09.065
I would,
I would do anything for you.


1158
00:58:09.107 --> 00:58:13.194
Until something
more cool and sexy


1159
00:58:13.236 --> 00:58:14.571
comes along?

1160
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.323
That's not fair.

1161
00:58:19.785 --> 00:58:22.203
Let's just get tomorrow
over with.


1162
00:58:23.914 --> 00:58:26.165
I was so dumb to think

1163
00:58:26.207 --> 00:58:30.629
that these past few days
meant anything.


1164
00:58:31.588 --> 00:58:33.757
They have, Maggie.

1165
00:58:33.799 --> 00:58:36.175
They've meant a lot to me.

1166
00:58:36.217 --> 00:58:38.929
-But?
-But...


1167
00:58:40.847 --> 00:58:45.184
We can't let whatever's
happening between us


1168
00:58:45.226 --> 00:58:47.145
jeopardize the show.

1169
00:58:47.186 --> 00:58:50.857
Wow. That's really the only
thing that you care about.


1170
00:58:50.899 --> 00:58:54.026
-It's unbelievable.
-Come on, Maggie.


1171
00:58:54.068 --> 00:58:58.114
Be reasonable. I'm not good
at relationships, you know that.


1172
00:58:59.866 --> 00:59:02.118
I don't ever wanna risk
losing you.


1173
00:59:03.536 --> 00:59:08.458
Sometimes risking everything...

1174
00:59:10.251 --> 00:59:12.629
is the only thing worth doing.

1175
00:59:15.381 --> 00:59:19.594
Maybe someday, Jack,
you'll realize that.


1176
00:59:21.638 --> 00:59:23.765
What are you saying?

1177
00:59:23.807 --> 00:59:26.685
Please, Jack, can you just go?

1178
00:59:26.726 --> 00:59:28.186
Maggie...

1179
00:59:29.729 --> 00:59:32.816
[instrumental music]

1180
00:59:42.534 --> 00:59:43.869
[door shuts]

1181
00:59:58.717 --> 01:00:00.886
Hi, dad, it's me.

1182
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:04.347
Can you talk?

1183
01:00:13.398 --> 01:00:15.066
[Maggie chuckles]

1184
01:00:15.107 --> 01:00:16.943
Dad, the club looks so good.

1185
01:00:16.985 --> 01:00:20.655
You've done
such an incredible job.


1186
01:00:20.697 --> 01:00:23.491
-It was a family affair.
-Hm.


1187
01:00:23.533 --> 01:00:24.826
Cheers.

1188
01:00:28.287 --> 01:00:30.415
But that's not why you're here.

1189
01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:35.503
What's on your mind, kiddo?

1190
01:00:39.007 --> 01:00:42.761
How did you know
that mom was the one?


1191
01:00:44.429 --> 01:00:46.138
Oh, gosh.

1192
01:00:48.433 --> 01:00:52.103
Well, it's hard to say
exactly how I knew, but, uh...


1193
01:00:53.688 --> 01:00:57.901
I think it came down to this
one day where I was cleaning


1194
01:00:57.943 --> 01:01:02.447
your grandpa's attic,
and your mom didn't wanna go


1195
01:01:02.488 --> 01:01:05.951
anywhere near it because she was
so deathly afraid of spiders.


1196
01:01:05.992 --> 01:01:09.245
Yeah, I know, she always
screamed when she saw them.


1197
01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:15.794
But on this one particular day,
she heard me fall


1198
01:01:15.835 --> 01:01:19.464
and break through
the old wooden floor up there,


1199
01:01:19.505 --> 01:01:23.718
and she ran faster
than the speed of light


1200
01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.804
into the attic.

1201
01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:28.765
She ran through tons of cobwebs.

1202
01:01:28.807 --> 01:01:31.810
They were all in her hair!

1203
01:01:31.851 --> 01:01:35.438
She faced her biggest fear
for you.


1204
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.317
Something about her doing that
made me realize


1205
01:01:39.358 --> 01:01:41.193
how much she loved me.

1206
01:01:44.363 --> 01:01:46.491
I really miss her.

1207
01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:51.537
I know. Me, too.

1208
01:01:55.959 --> 01:02:00.713
She would be so proud
of the woman you have become.


1209
01:02:04.092 --> 01:02:07.470
-I don't know about that.
-Are you kidding?


1210
01:02:07.512 --> 01:02:12.266
You're so full of integrity
and kindness.


1211
01:02:14.352 --> 01:02:16.896
A parent couldn't ask
for anything more.


1212
01:02:20.483 --> 01:02:22.027
Dad...

1213
01:02:23.319 --> 01:02:25.697
I think
I gotta tell you somethin'.


1214
01:02:25.738 --> 01:02:27.657
Hm?

1215
01:02:27.699 --> 01:02:30.869
-Is it about Jack?
-Yeah.


1216
01:02:32.871 --> 01:02:34.998
You really love him, don't you?

1217
01:02:36.875 --> 01:02:39.585
Yeah. I think I do.

1218
01:02:39.627 --> 01:02:41.754
So, what's the problem?

1219
01:02:45.424 --> 01:02:47.802
I just don't think that...

1220
01:02:49.929 --> 01:02:52.765
he would run through cobwebs
for me.


1221
01:02:55.935 --> 01:02:58.771
Jack has a good heart,

1222
01:02:58.813 --> 01:03:03.651
but he's never been very good
with expressing his feelings.


1223
01:03:03.693 --> 01:03:06.487
Why do you think he's had
so many short-term girlfriends?


1224
01:03:07.488 --> 01:03:09.407
Why?

1225
01:03:09.448 --> 01:03:12.035
'Cause he's afraid
of getting hurt.


1226
01:03:13.619 --> 01:03:17.999
So, wait, I'm just supposed
to wait around


1227
01:03:18.041 --> 01:03:22.503
until he decides to grow up
and show his real feelings?


1228
01:03:22.545 --> 01:03:24.839
Well, that part is up to you.

1229
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:31.512
But you deserve someone

1230
01:03:31.554 --> 01:03:33.890
who will shout
from the rooftops


1231
01:03:33.932 --> 01:03:35.100
how much they love you.

1232
01:03:35.141 --> 01:03:38.770
Mm! Thanks, dad.

1233
01:03:38.811 --> 01:03:42.065
Don't you settle
for anything less.


1234
01:03:42.107 --> 01:03:45.193
-I won't.
-Mm.


1235
01:03:53.118 --> 01:03:54.869
Where is she?
I can't get ahold of her!


1236
01:03:54.911 --> 01:03:57.705
I don't know. She's never late.
I hope she's okay.


1237
01:03:57.747 --> 01:04:00.959
-Well, did you do something?
-What? No.


1238
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.544
-Why would you say that?
-Because you're you.


1239
01:04:03.586 --> 01:04:05.004
[footsteps approaching]

1240
01:04:05.046 --> 01:04:07.381
-There you are.
-Oh, thank God.


1241
01:04:07.423 --> 01:04:09.134
You're on in one minute.

1242
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:13.554
Maggie, you all right?

1243
01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:15.598
We're almost on.
Put your headphones on.


1244
01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:23.982
Good morning, everyone,
and thank you for tuning in


1245
01:04:24.023 --> 01:04:26.317
to The Windy City Wake-Up!
I am Jack Russo.


1246
01:04:26.358 --> 01:04:28.278
And I am Maggie Quinn.

1247
01:04:28.319 --> 01:04:30.196
Today is a very exciting day
for us.


1248
01:04:30.238 --> 01:04:33.116
Our big New Year's Eve bash
is tonight at The Magnolia,


1249
01:04:33.158 --> 01:04:35.534
and do we ever have a surprise
for all of you.


1250
01:04:35.576 --> 01:04:37.620
The show is sold out, but you
can catch the live stream


1251
01:04:37.662 --> 01:04:40.832
on our website, so you don't
have to miss a thing.


1252
01:04:40.873 --> 01:04:44.002
How are you feeling
about tonight, Maggie?


1253
01:04:44.043 --> 01:04:47.088
I'm nervous, truthfully.

1254
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.340
Just want the whole thing
to be over with.


1255
01:04:53.719 --> 01:04:56.472
Introducing someone new
to our families is a big deal.


1256
01:04:56.514 --> 01:05:00.392
Frankly, I'm terrified.
But it should still be fun.


1257
01:05:00.434 --> 01:05:02.270
If you say so.

1258
01:05:04.189 --> 01:05:06.024
Right. I think we should get
to our first caller.


1259
01:05:06.065 --> 01:05:07.192
Sounds great.

1260
01:05:09.027 --> 01:05:10.361
You are live
with Jack and Maggie.


1261
01:05:10.402 --> 01:05:12.155
What can we
help you with today?


1262
01:05:12.197 --> 01:05:14.073
[man on radio] I have to say,
I don't know what you guys


1263
01:05:14.115 --> 01:05:16.450
are so afraid of.
The moment I met my wife,


1264
01:05:16.492 --> 01:05:19.120
I introduced her to my family
within a month.


1265
01:05:19.162 --> 01:05:21.331
I couldn't wait
to start my life with her.


1266
01:05:21.413 --> 01:05:23.708
Really? So fast? Wow.

1267
01:05:23.749 --> 01:05:25.877
How did you know
your wife was the one?


1268
01:05:25.918 --> 01:05:28.338
[man on radio] The thought
of losing her was way scarier


1269
01:05:28.379 --> 01:05:30.298
than committing to her.

1270
01:05:36.262 --> 01:05:38.681
What was that about?

1271
01:05:38.723 --> 01:05:40.183
You hardly said anything
the entire show.


1272
01:05:40.225 --> 01:05:42.393
I'm gonna get a coffee.
Do you want anything?


1273
01:05:42.434 --> 01:05:45.104
-So this is how it's gonna be?
-I'll take that as a no.


1274
01:05:46.731 --> 01:05:50.235
Please. Can we just talk?

1275
01:05:50.276 --> 01:05:54.280
I'll see you tonight...
if you remember to show up.


1276
01:06:06.542 --> 01:06:08.253
Thank you so much.

1277
01:06:09.962 --> 01:06:11.714
-Oh, Mag, Maggie?
-Hunter.


1278
01:06:11.756 --> 01:06:12.965
-Hi.
-Hi.


1279
01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:15.801
-How are you?
-Uh, I'm fine.


1280
01:06:15.843 --> 01:06:17.970
-[laughing] And you?
-Good, good.


1281
01:06:18.012 --> 01:06:20.139
I've been listening
to your show a lot.


1282
01:06:20.181 --> 01:06:22.558
Um, sounds like you're, uh,
gonna be going through


1283
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.976
with that
whole meet-the-parents thing


1284
01:06:24.018 --> 01:06:26.354
even though
we're not together anymore.


1285
01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:30.275
Did you, uh,
start seeing someone else?


1286
01:06:30.316 --> 01:06:32.985
-I could ask you the same thing.
-What?


1287
01:06:33.027 --> 01:06:36.406
Oh, well, I-I just saw you here
the other day with someone.


1288
01:06:36.447 --> 01:06:38.699
Oh, she,
she had her hand on yours.


1289
01:06:38.741 --> 01:06:42.370
[sighs]
You mean my sister Madison?


1290
01:06:42.412 --> 01:06:44.122
-Your sister?
-Yeah.


1291
01:06:44.163 --> 01:06:45.915
I mean, you'd know that
if you hadn't been


1292
01:06:45.957 --> 01:06:48.418
too scared to meet my family.

1293
01:06:48.459 --> 01:06:50.795
I just assumed... Whoops.

1294
01:06:50.836 --> 01:06:54.966
[laughs] So who are you
introducing your family to?


1295
01:06:55.007 --> 01:06:57.760
Um, we're actually
surprising our fans


1296
01:06:57.802 --> 01:07:00.221
with something different.

1297
01:07:00.263 --> 01:07:01.764
-Yeah?
-Yeah, it's kind of crazy.


1298
01:07:01.806 --> 01:07:03.724
Actually. Yeah, well, um...

1299
01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:07.228
Would you, um, maybe wanna have
our coffees together?


1300
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:09.188
Uh, yeah.

1301
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:11.816
-Yeah.
-Great.


1302
01:07:17.363 --> 01:07:20.491
Backstage tour
of the Goodman Theatre?


1303
01:07:20.532 --> 01:07:23.035
Oh, Hunter, your students
are gonna love you.


1304
01:07:23.077 --> 01:07:25.704
I know, right? 
That's, yeah...

1305
01:07:25.746 --> 01:07:27.915
Anyways, um, how about yourself?

1306
01:07:27.957 --> 01:07:29.375
This, uh, this event tonight,

1307
01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:31.836
it seems like
it's the talk of the town.


1308
01:07:33.921 --> 01:07:37.967
Look, um, Hunter,

1309
01:07:38.009 --> 01:07:40.719
I'm really sorry
about everything.


1310
01:07:40.761 --> 01:07:43.555
You deserve more, more than
someone trying to push away


1311
01:07:43.597 --> 01:07:44.932
their feelings for someone else.

1312
01:07:44.974 --> 01:07:48.353
Yeah. You finally admit it, huh?

1313
01:07:48.394 --> 01:07:51.730
Yeah, I thought
if I met someone like you,


1314
01:07:51.772 --> 01:07:55.026
those feelings
would just go away.


1315
01:07:55.067 --> 01:07:57.362
[sighs]
If only life were that easy.


1316
01:07:58.737 --> 01:08:01.115
Yeah. Well, cheers to that.

1317
01:08:01.157 --> 01:08:02.450
-Right?
-Yeah.


1318
01:08:02.492 --> 01:08:03.868
-To friends.
-To friends.


1319
01:08:03.909 --> 01:08:05.828
-And coffee.
-Okay.


1320
01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.093
Hey, dad.

1321
01:08:21.135 --> 01:08:23.262
Jack? What are you doing here?

1322
01:08:23.304 --> 01:08:26.098
Figured I'd stop by, s-see
how everything's shaping up.


1323
01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.808
Shouldn't you two
be getting ready?


1324
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:30.269
[sighs]

1325
01:08:30.311 --> 01:08:33.605
We, uh, got in a fight.

1326
01:08:35.191 --> 01:08:37.109
I think I might lose her.

1327
01:08:38.694 --> 01:08:41.030
It's impossible, kid.

1328
01:08:41.072 --> 01:08:44.283
-You're everything to her.
-I know.


1329
01:08:44.325 --> 01:08:47.912
I've been taking it for granted
this whole time.


1330
01:08:47.953 --> 01:08:50.998
Well, then you need to do
something


1331
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.042
to show her
how much she means to you.


1332
01:08:53.084 --> 01:08:54.710
Where do I even start?

1333
01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:01.133
Look, you know her better
than anyone.


1334
01:09:01.175 --> 01:09:03.261
There has to be something.

1335
01:09:04.178 --> 01:09:06.180
What would make her happy?

1336
01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:16.023
I think I know
what I need to do.


1337
01:09:16.065 --> 01:09:18.276
Attaboy, son.

1338
01:09:18.317 --> 01:09:19.818
Thanks, dad.

1339
01:09:27.034 --> 01:09:28.536
[beeping]

1340
01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:29.870
Thank you. Next one, please.

1341
01:09:29.912 --> 01:09:31.747
-Thank you.
-[beeping]


1342
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:33.665
Shouldn't they be
at their own party by now?


1343
01:09:33.707 --> 01:09:35.418
Uh, well, they're on their way.

1344
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:38.170
They just want to build up
the anticipation!


1345
01:09:38.212 --> 01:09:41.132
-Hi, beautiful.
-Hello, Jack.


1346
01:09:41.173 --> 01:09:42.550
-Hey, Jack.
-Hi.


1347
01:09:42.592 --> 01:09:44.427
Thank God. There's Jack now.

1348
01:09:44.469 --> 01:09:47.555
Hey, Jack.
Looking very dapper tonight.


1349
01:09:47.597 --> 01:09:49.140
So you excited
for the big reveal?


1350
01:09:49.181 --> 01:09:50.558
Yeah.

1351
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.767
I'm a little nervous,

1352
01:09:51.809 --> 01:09:53.561
but I think I'm finally ready.

1353
01:09:53.603 --> 01:09:55.480
Have you seen Maggie yet?

1354
01:09:55.521 --> 01:09:58.023
Uh, not yet, but she'll be here.

1355
01:09:58.065 --> 01:10:00.901
In fact, you know, I think I'm
gonna go look for her right now.


1356
01:10:03.195 --> 01:10:04.572
So, Jack,
I heard the show today.


1357
01:10:04.614 --> 01:10:05.990
Sorry about that one, Judd.

1358
01:10:06.031 --> 01:10:07.533
Maggie wasn't really
feeling well.


1359
01:10:07.575 --> 01:10:10.161
-I thought you sounded great.
-Really?


1360
01:10:10.202 --> 01:10:12.246
In fact, I wanted to discuss
something with you.


1361
01:10:12.288 --> 01:10:16.000
I spoke to my executives, we
think you guys are just so great


1362
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:19.587
that you would do just as well
with your own shows.


1363
01:10:19.629 --> 01:10:20.712
Does Maggie know about this?

1364
01:10:20.754 --> 01:10:22.131
I floated the idea by her

1365
01:10:22.173 --> 01:10:23.508
earlier on the phone and

1366
01:10:23.549 --> 01:10:25.717
she seemed very interested.

1367
01:10:28.095 --> 01:10:30.515
-Oh.
-Oh, there she is.


1368
01:10:30.556 --> 01:10:32.724
-Hi.
-You look ravishing, Maggie.


1369
01:10:32.766 --> 01:10:34.435
Oh, thank you.

1370
01:10:34.477 --> 01:10:36.354
[Judd] I am gonna go
get the camera crew


1371
01:10:36.395 --> 01:10:38.648
and we're gonna get
this celebration started.


1372
01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:41.775
[clears throat]

1373
01:10:41.817 --> 01:10:44.069
-Hi.
-Hi.


1374
01:10:45.363 --> 01:10:47.615
You look really beautiful.

1375
01:10:47.657 --> 01:10:49.492
Thanks.

1376
01:10:49.534 --> 01:10:52.578
So, l-listen, J-Judd was saying
you were interested in his offer


1377
01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.581
to have your own radio show.
Is that true?


1378
01:10:55.623 --> 01:10:58.250
It might be time
we did something apart.


1379
01:10:58.292 --> 01:10:59.835
You really feel like that?

1380
01:11:01.462 --> 01:11:03.005
Wow.

1381
01:11:04.006 --> 01:11:05.841
First Hunter, now this.

1382
01:11:05.883 --> 01:11:09.679
-What?
-I saw you two today.


1383
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.390
[sighs] What does it matter
to you, Jack?


1384
01:11:15.059 --> 01:11:17.645
Really? You brought her?

1385
01:11:18.688 --> 01:11:19.855
I gave her my extra ticket.

1386
01:11:19.897 --> 01:11:21.357
Did you bring her
a corsage, too?


1387
01:11:21.399 --> 01:11:22.983
-Hm, Maggie.

that just walked in?

-Okay. Babe alert.
-Yeah.

-[Maggie] Great question.

We are on in ten, okay?

-Bianca and I are just friends.
-We're not actually together.

what you want.

-But--
-Three.

Two, one.

1419

To get the party started,

1420
01:13:07.421 --> 01:13:09.298
we want everyone
to pick a dance partner.

That includes
the live-streamers. Yeah.

The fabulous and talented
Davin Bros

and get us moving.

everybody dance for a bit.


1426

Then we got a few contests
for the fans.


1427
01:13:45.626 --> 01:13:47.961
11:45, we're gonna get you both
back on the stage


1428
01:13:48.003 --> 01:13:49.714
for the big reveal,
then at midnight


1429
01:13:49.755 --> 01:13:51.841
we're gonna have
an earth-shaking kiss.


1430
01:13:51.882 --> 01:13:53.050
Sound good?

1431
01:13:53.091 --> 01:13:55.594
-Sure. Yeah.
-Yeah. I guess.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on with you guys?

-Nothing.
-Nothing.

I need bigger and better energy
from you


1436

1437
01:14:06.397 --> 01:14:08.190
Yes!

1438
01:14:11.485 --> 01:14:13.571
I hope you told Bianca
about the big reveal,


1439
01:14:13.612 --> 01:14:16.031
otherwise she's gonna be
really confused at midnight.


1440
01:14:16.073 --> 01:14:19.410
What? I'm not with her,
she's here to support us.


1441
01:14:22.246 --> 01:14:25.374
Man, I, I haven't seen the club
this packed in years!


1442
01:14:25.416 --> 01:14:27.835
[laughing] Yeah.
Yeah. It's quite the turnout.


1443
01:14:27.877 --> 01:14:31.714
Yeah. Oh, I just was talking
to one of your biggest fans.


1444
01:14:31.756 --> 01:14:35.718
And they were going on and on
about how refreshing it is


1445
01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.969
that you two never hold back

1446
01:14:38.011 --> 01:14:42.349
from telling the truth
to your listeners.


1447
01:14:42.391 --> 01:14:44.894
I'm just so proud
of the both of you.

Great job, you two!

01:15:03.954 --> 01:15:05.205
And just for playing, we have

that you have all
been waiting for.

Right. The big surprise.

1457
01:15:20.679 --> 01:15:22.723
As you probably picked up
by now,


1458
01:15:22.765 --> 01:15:25.810
Hunter and Serena are not
meeting our families tonight.


1459
01:15:25.851 --> 01:15:29.271
And the reason
for that is because...


1460
01:15:29.313 --> 01:15:30.773
[instrumental music]

1461
01:15:30.815 --> 01:15:32.733
It's because...

1462
01:15:35.736 --> 01:15:37.237
What's wrong?

1463
01:15:37.279 --> 01:15:39.448
[Jack] It's because...?

1464
01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:42.743
-Jack, I can't do this.
-What are you doing?


1465
01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:46.914
-I need to tell the truth.
-Maggie, don't do this.


1466
01:15:46.956 --> 01:15:48.958
Uh, the truth is...

1467
01:15:50.793 --> 01:15:53.796
is, um, Hunter and Serena

1468
01:15:53.838 --> 01:15:55.714
are not a part of our show
tonight...


1469
01:15:55.756 --> 01:15:57.716
[audience groaning]

1470
01:15:57.758 --> 01:16:00.594
because they broke up with us.

1471
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:06.809
So Jack and I decided that

1472
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:08.059
to make this night successful,

1473
01:16:08.101 --> 01:16:10.562
we would pretend
to be in a relationship.


1474
01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:16.151
And I know it would have made
for really great ratings,


1475
01:16:16.193 --> 01:16:20.030
which is fantastic, but that's
not the important part.


1476
01:16:20.071 --> 01:16:23.200
Along the way
I started to forget


1477
01:16:23.241 --> 01:16:27.872
that this was... all just a lie.

1478
01:16:29.957 --> 01:16:32.250
And the truth is,

1479
01:16:32.292 --> 01:16:34.753
it wasn't a lie to me.

1480
01:16:39.174 --> 01:16:41.510
I'm so sorry, everyone.

1481

-Cut to commercial.
-No. No way! This is good drama.

Keep rolling.

1483
01:16:51.061 --> 01:16:53.731
Maggie's right.

1484
01:16:53.772 --> 01:16:55.357
It was my plan
to trick everybody


1485
01:16:55.399 --> 01:16:57.401
and pretend
that we were together.

[crowd gasping]

1487

But my plan
completely backfired


1488
01:17:02.489 --> 01:17:05.283
because after
a lifelong friendship,


1489
01:17:05.325 --> 01:17:08.662
I finally realized that Maggie
has always been the one for me.


1490
01:17:11.248 --> 01:17:15.293
She means more to me
than any career move.


1491
01:17:15.335 --> 01:17:18.047
In fact,
the legendary Judd Crawford


1492
01:17:18.088 --> 01:17:21.341
asked me if I'd like to have
my own radio show.


1493

The answer is no.

I never wanna wake up
without knowing

I get to see my best friend,

I'm sorry it took me so long
to finally realize it.

Are you sure?

I know we just got together,

ready to meet my family?
