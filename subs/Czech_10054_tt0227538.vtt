00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:13.879
Carmen, Juni, time for bed.

2
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.507
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I already did.


3
00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:22.012
- Juni, don't forget to brush--
- I am, I am.


4
00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:24.640
All right, all right.

5
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:28.143
JUNI: OK, warts. Uhh!

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:31.647

00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:39.821
Yeah. It's good. It's fine.

9
00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:43.659
OK. Well, lights out.

10
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.619
Bedtime story first.

11
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.454
What story do you want to hear?

12
00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:50.374
"The Two Spies
Who Fell In Love."


13

Hmm. Wow.

14
00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:55.712
I haven't told that one
in a while.


15
00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:58.799
You probably remember that
better than I do.


16
00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:02.303
- Want to hear a story, Juni?
- I'm listening.


17
00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.304
OK.

18
00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:06.306
Once upon a time...

19
00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:08.934
there was a man and a woman.

20
00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:11.228
- And they were both spies.
- Yes.


21
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.230
She from one country,
he from another.


22
00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:16.734
She had a very important mission
assigned to her.


23
00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:19.152
- He was her mission.
- Correct.


24
00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:21.905
Her mission was to take him out.

25
00:02:21.947 --> 00:02:23.824
CARMEN: On a date?

26
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.078
No. Uh, take him--

27
00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.704
Oh, you mean...

28
00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:29.955
I shouldn't be telling you this.

29
00:02:29.997 --> 00:02:32.249
- Go on. Go on.
- You have to understand...


30
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:33.751
these were
dark and confusing times.


31
00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:36.837
An enormous amount of turmoil
between countries.

INGRID: Out off ear...

33
00:02:38.088 --> 00:02:40.340
a new kind of soldier
was created--

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:42.926
brilliant, brave soldiers...

35
00:02:42.926 --> 00:02:46.930
whose greatest weapons
were their minds.


36
00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:51.393
Those men and women were spies.

37
00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:12.789
They were masters of disguise.

38
00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:15.917
They could sense danger
a mile away...


39
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.586
and through their work...

40
00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:20.589
wars were ended
before they even started.

[Electronic beeping]

42
00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:29.222
The only things spies
were truly afraid of...


43
00:03:29.264 --> 00:03:31.600
were other spies--

44
00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:33.978
enemy spies.

45
00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.772
So, sometimes,
one spy's mission...


46
00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:40.150
was to make
the enemy disappear.


47
00:03:40.192 --> 00:03:44.988
He was the assignment
that changed her life...


48
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.157
but when the moment
finally came...


49
00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.492
to carry out her mission...

50
00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:55.123
she couldn't do it.

51
00:03:57.376 --> 00:04:00.296
He was different
than she expected.


52
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:07.302
Sure, he was charming
and intelligent...


53
00:04:09.054 --> 00:04:12.474
but he was
unexpectedly honorable...


54
00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:13.976
and it made her realize...

55
00:04:14.017 --> 00:04:16.228
how years of working
with detached emotion...


56
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.689
had taken its toll.

57
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.524
So they kept contact...

58
00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:24.862
through lunch dates--
very discreet.


59
00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:26.613
After all,
they were on different sides...


60
00:04:26.697 --> 00:04:28.949
so they could never
be seen together.


61
00:04:29.032 --> 00:04:30.492

wherever their mutual
travels took them.


63
00:04:32.578 --> 00:04:34.538
And they fell in love...

64
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.665
and they decided
that, together...


65
00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:38.500
they would embark...

66
00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:41.378

00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:50.012

she would rather brave...

a thousand deadly missions...

73
00:04:51.763 --> 00:04:53.473
than go through with what
she was about to attempt.


74
00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:55.642
CARMEN: Why is that?

75
00:04:55.684 --> 00:04:57.769
Well, marriage is a mission
so complex...

that only the most courageous
and slightly insane need apply.

There's such an amazing
series of obstacles...

the two most dangerous...

one of them gone.

CARMEN: Autopilot...failing?

973
00:58:11.547 --> 00:58:14.925
Oh, great.
Another fine Machete product.


974
00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:16.969
Take control.
We have to go to manual.


975
00:58:17.052 --> 00:58:18.887
Now!

976
00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:21.723
CARMEN: You were supposed
to read all the instructions!


977
00:58:23.851 --> 00:58:25.811
You skipped a chapter, meathead.

978
00:58:25.853 --> 00:58:28.314
Better stop calling me names.

979
00:58:28.355 --> 00:58:30.023
Pull up, booger breath !

980
00:58:30.065 --> 00:58:31.775
Stop it or I'll call you names.

CARMEN: Go ahead.
You got nothin' on me, warthog.


982
00:58:34.653 --> 00:58:39.199
Try me...diaper lady.

983
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:43.411
Aha.
Hope you're wearing one now.


984
00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:46.581
- How long have you known?
- Since forever.


985
00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:49.042
Mom made me swear
not to mention it.


986
00:58:49.084 --> 00:58:51.920
So now we're even !

987
00:58:51.962 --> 00:58:54.173
CARMEN: Oh, now you've done it!

988
00:58:54.214 --> 00:58:57.426
I knew this was gonna happen !

989
00:58:57.467 --> 00:59:00.011
We're gonna crash
if you don't do something !


990

CARMEN: You did that
on purpose, you kamikaze!

JUNI: But now it's balanced!

993
00:59:11.773 --> 00:59:14.192
No landing gear.
We're gonna crash !


994

CARMEN:
Nope. We're gonna drop.


995
00:59:17.613 --> 00:59:19.031
Get your regulator ready.

Can you hear me?


997

Yeah.

- Ecch.
- Sorry.


1002
01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:15.587
A Thumb-thumb.

What did you do to him?

1005
01:00:43.365 --> 01:00:45.409
Machete's electroshock gumballs.

1006
01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:48.536
It says long lasting.
But I don't trust wrappers.

01:00:59.715 --> 01:01:00.674

What are you doing?

1010
01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.525
World's smallest cameras.

1011
01:01:18.567 --> 01:01:21.945
I just placed them
all over the main hallways.

- Sweet.
- Thanks.

Got an idea?

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.876
Yeah.

- I got it.
- What'd he say?


1022
01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:08.283
I'll play it backwards.

1023
01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:10.577
DONNAGON:
They're in the dungeon. Hurry.


1024
01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:12.079
See if they know
where the Brain room is.


1025
01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.376
Uh-oh.

1026
01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:19.794
Thumb-thumbs--everywhere.

1027
01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.297
Let's see if they like bubbles.

1028
01:02:33.642 --> 01:02:36.562
We'll be back for you,
fellow agents.

to docking bays four, five,
and six for immediate loading.


1033
01:02:46.238 --> 01:02:48.699
This is the ventilator shaft
here.


1034
01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.868
CARMEN: But the dungeon's on
the other side of the castle.


1035
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:54.621
How do we get there undetected?

1036
01:03:06.675 --> 01:03:08.385
[Whispering] I think
they've gotten smarter...

Come on. Come on !

- Carmen !
- Find Mom and Dad !


1044
01:03:43.462 --> 01:03:44.922
I hope this leads
to the dungeon.

FLOOP: Warts, aren't they?

1048

Oh, great.

From sweaty hands sprout warts.

FLOOP: Do you know why
you have sweaty hands?


1051
01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:14.242
From being scared all the time.

1052

You don't look
very scared to me.


1053
01:04:19.122 --> 01:04:22.626
That's because I'm mad.
You kidnapped my parents...

- You know him?
- Yeah.


1063
01:04:54.283 --> 01:04:56.202
He was on
the Third Brain Project...


1064
01:04:56.285 --> 01:04:58.704
until I noticed
he was trying to inject...


1065

his own ideas into the system.

1066

I turned him in.

nearly the artist Floop is.

But not to worry.

1070
01:05:11.758 --> 01:05:14.386
I have something else in mind.

to accomplish by doing this?

Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez...

I've always been methodical,

turned off from the outside.

1286
01:18:23.342 --> 01:18:28.222
Anything we tell them goes
in one ear and out the other!


1287
01:18:31.266 --> 01:18:33.477
Why did you come back?

1288
01:18:35.854 --> 01:18:38.148
For the same reason I left.

1289
01:18:39.358 --> 01:18:42.027
You know what?

1290
01:18:42.069 --> 01:18:44.488
I don't remember that reason.

1291
01:18:45.989 --> 01:18:47.824
Neither do I.

1292
01:18:47.908 --> 01:18:49.034
[Sniffling]

1293
01:18:49.117 --> 01:18:51.077
It's OK, it's OK.

1294
01:18:51.119 --> 01:18:53.121
It's OK. Let it go. Let it go.

1295
01:18:53.163 --> 01:18:54.665
He's fine. He's gonna be fine.

1296
01:18:54.748 --> 01:18:57.626
He's emotional. Latinos.

1297
01:18:57.668 --> 01:18:59.753
OK. That's it.

1298
01:18:59.795 --> 01:19:01.755
That's it. That's it.

1299
01:19:04.174 --> 01:19:06.635
So, what did you teach them?

1300
01:19:06.677 --> 01:19:09.555
It's not what
I can teach the children...


1301
01:19:09.596 --> 01:19:12.432
but what you taught me.

1302
01:19:12.474 --> 01:19:14.685
You won today, Juni,
and not because...


1303
01:19:14.726 --> 01:19:16.686
you were the biggest
or the strongest...


1304
01:19:16.728 --> 01:19:20.899
but because you were
pure of heart and of mind.


1305
01:19:22.442 --> 01:19:24.861
And now the robots
have learned that as well.


1306
01:19:24.945 --> 01:19:27.197
Thank you.

1307
01:19:27.239 --> 01:19:30.993
We went on the old-fashioned
adventure I always wanted.


1308
01:19:31.034 --> 01:19:33.495
And we didn't do
one thing right.


1309
01:19:33.537 --> 01:19:35.497
Nope.

1310
01:19:35.539 --> 01:19:39.043
We did two things right.

1311
01:19:39.084 --> 01:19:41.545
There is something
that we have to tell you.


1312
01:19:41.587 --> 01:19:43.714
INGRID: Your father and I...

1313
01:19:43.755 --> 01:19:45.674
we're secret agents.

1314
01:19:45.716 --> 01:19:47.843
We have something to tell you.

1315
01:19:49.636 --> 01:19:51.805
We're secret agents, too.

1316
01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:08.071
NEWSCASTER: Eight more
incidents witnessed today...


1317
01:20:08.113 --> 01:20:10.073
all in different countries...

1318
01:20:10.115 --> 01:20:11.950
of yet another group
of children...


1319
01:20:11.992 --> 01:20:14.077
who've done
some incredible good deeds.


1320
01:20:14.119 --> 01:20:16.204
It seems that a day
doesn't go by...


1321
01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:17.914
that another amazing child...

1322
01:20:17.956 --> 01:20:20.167
performs some outstanding
act of charity...


1323
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:21.877
or community service.

1324
01:20:21.919 --> 01:20:23.546
Who are these children...

1325
01:20:23.587 --> 01:20:26.215
and why are they so good
at being good?


1326
01:20:30.511 --> 01:20:32.471
I gotta have
the business section.


1327
01:20:32.513 --> 01:20:34.432
I thought
you closed down your shop.


1328
01:20:34.473 --> 01:20:36.558
Yeah, but I gotta keep tabs
on free enterprise.


1329
01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.144
CARMEN: Boys,
can we please stop fighting?


1330

ANNOUNCER: Hey, kids,
it's time for...


1331
01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:47.986
Floop's Fooglies!

1332
01:20:50.113 --> 01:20:51.906
Good morning, my children.

1333
01:20:51.949 --> 01:20:53.909
Today,
I'd like to introduce you...


1334
01:20:53.951 --> 01:20:56.245
to two new characters
on our show...


1335
01:20:56.286 --> 01:20:58.747
Carmenita and Junito.

1336
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:01.917
[Beeping tone]

1337
01:21:01.959 --> 01:21:04.253
Ah, Cortezes.

1338
01:21:04.294 --> 01:21:06.755
An emergency assignment
has come up in the Far East.


1339
01:21:06.797 --> 01:21:08.132
I need you on it right away.

1340
01:21:08.173 --> 01:21:09.591
Oh, sorry, Devlin.

1341
01:21:09.633 --> 01:21:12.052
We haven't talked about this
as a family yet, so...


1342
01:21:12.094 --> 01:21:14.388
GREGORIO: Whether we
come out of retirement...


1343
01:21:14.429 --> 01:21:17.682
or not is a decision
that is up to us...


1344
01:21:17.724 --> 01:21:20.227
and our kids.

1345
01:21:20.269 --> 01:21:23.189
Uh, Gregorio, Ingrid,
I wasn't talking to you.


1346
01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:24.940
Ey?

1347
01:21:24.982 --> 01:21:27.526
No, this assignment
is for Carmen and Juni.


1348
01:21:27.568 --> 01:21:28.861
They're the ones we need.

1349
01:21:28.902 --> 01:21:30.862
They're the two most amazing
field agents...


1350
01:21:30.904 --> 01:21:32.739
that this organization's
ever seen.


1351
01:21:32.823 --> 01:21:34.616
So what do you say, kids?

1352
01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.535
You up for it?

1353
01:21:36.577 --> 01:21:38.037
Devlin,
if you want the Cortezes...


1354
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.372
you take all the Cortezes...

1355
01:21:40.414 --> 01:21:43.500
even Mom and Dad.

1356
01:21:43.542 --> 01:21:47.379
From now on, whatever we do,
we do together.


1357
01:21:49.756 --> 01:21:51.800
Spy work...that's easy.

1358
01:21:51.842 --> 01:21:54.345
Keeping a family together...

1359
01:21:54.344 --> 01:21:56.471
that's difficult.

1360
01:21:56.513 --> 01:22:00.058
And that's the mission
worth fighting for.


1361
01:24:20.032 --> 01:24:22.993
FONDA: Stay close,
I know that you're with me


1362
01:24:22.993 --> 01:24:25.996
Get down and stay out of sight

1363
01:24:25.996 --> 01:24:28.165
So quick, move like a flash

1364
01:24:28.207 --> 01:24:31.711
Then we're gone, you're safe

Little spies

Have a big surprise

01:25:16.213 --> 01:25:18.841
And make no mistake

Because we're in charge

Look out, always in danger

1383
01:25:44.074 --> 01:25:47.160
Look out, always in danger

- Look out
- Spy Kids

Always in danger

Go, go, go, go

FLOOP:
It's a cruel, cruel world


1391
01:26:14.897 --> 01:26:16.565
All you little boys and girls

1392
01:26:16.607 --> 01:26:18.400
And some mean, nasty people

1393
01:26:18.442 --> 01:26:20.444
Want to have you
for their supper


1394
01:26:20.527 --> 01:26:23.947
But if you follow me,
you can all be free

Free, you can all be free

1396

If you dream, if you dream,
if you dream


1398
01:26:31.622 --> 01:26:33.499
My dream

1399
01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.250
It's a cold, cruel world
for the nasty boys and girls


1400
01:26:35.292 --> 01:26:36.960
And the selfish,
mean, nasty people

Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty

But there's a way
you can make your day

You can laugh, you can smile

1404
01:26:43.342 --> 01:26:44.844
You can come and stay a while

1405

You can dream my dream

1406
01:26:46.345 --> 01:26:47.972
You can have it all with me

1407
01:26:48.013 --> 01:26:51.141
You can dream my dream,
you can dream my dream


1408
01:26:51.225 --> 01:26:52.685
You can dream
