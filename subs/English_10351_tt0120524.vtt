2
00:02:55.652 --> 00:03:01.341
Once, in a time before time,
God breathed life into the universe.


3
00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:07.827
And the light gave birth to Angels.
And the earth gave birth to man.


4
00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:16.770
And fire gave birth to the Djinn. Creatures
condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds.


5
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.508
One who wakes a Djinn
shall be given three wishes.

6
00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:29.966
Upon the granting of the third, the unholy legions
of the Djinn shall be freed upon the earth.


7
00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:40.166
Fear one thing only in all that is...
Fear the Djinn.


8
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.897
Make your second wish.

9
00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:47.038
Astonish Me, Djinn.
Show me wonders.


10
00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:50.009
As you wish.

11
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.668
Help me, sorcerer.
Help me!


12
00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:37.346
Free us wizard.
Remove this curse.


13
00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:39.623
Help us.

14
00:05:46.563 --> 00:05:51.385
Behold. By all the names of God,
This is not what I wanted!


15
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.218
Then wish it away exalted one.
Wish it away.


16
00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:57.604
Stop!

17
00:05:57.922 --> 00:05:58.871
No more wishes.

18
00:05:59.134 --> 00:06:00.913
I beg your majesty. Silence.

19
00:06:00.913 --> 00:06:03.187
But my poor people.
I must...


20
00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:05.968
Do you wish their
fate on the entire world?

21
00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:08.594
No more wishes. Please.

22
00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:12.869
I warned you, wizard.
Hold your tongue.


23
00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.636
I'm the wish, is all this creature needs.

24
00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:18.878
Three wishes granted
to the one who woke him


25
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.648
lets him open the gateway between worlds.

26
00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:24.139
New wonders, majesty.

27
00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.870
New splendors.

28
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.594
And new and terrible masters.

29
00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:31.952
Yes...

30
00:07:38.575 --> 00:07:42.243
(America, present day)

31
00:07:58.287 --> 00:08:00.975
I'm surprised you're here in person Mr. Beaumont.

32
00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:02.684
Paperwork is completely in order.

33
00:08:02.684 --> 00:08:06.064
I waited it ten years, for this piece.

34
00:08:06.242 --> 00:08:10.718
Antiquarian sculpture.
Eight foot tall.


35
00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:16.451
A statue of the pre-Islamic God,
Ahura Mazda.


36
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:20.011
Under Islam, these gods were outlawed.

37
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:24.123
It's a miracle this was ever made.

38
00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:36.917
Jesus Christ!

39
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:38.806
What the hell is he doing?

40
00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:40.802
God dammit!

41
00:08:40.802 --> 00:08:43.583
Does the word DUMB ASS
mean anything to you?


42
00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:45.809
Watch that crate!
That's very expensive stuff!


43
00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:46.787
Up yours...

44
00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.340
...ahh shit!

45
00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:03.434
Ughhhh. Ten years...

46
00:09:54.137 --> 00:09:55.762
Hi. I can help you?

47
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:59.406
Maybe. I got a pawnshop down
the garment district,


48
00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:02.395
5th and Tooley. 
The armpit of the universe.

49
00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:05.769
Anyway, this came in this morning.

50
00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:10.566
I had a hunch about it. Gave the guy a good price,
and I'd like you to appraise it.


51
00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:13.134
Well, I think you made a smart move.

52
00:10:13.704 --> 00:10:15.455
- Nick?
- Shannon?


53
00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:18.884
I think we have something
Alex should take a look at.


54
00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.353
Hello Betty!

55
00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:25.435
Wow. This is ah... uh, this...

56
00:10:26.531 --> 00:10:27.612
Which is its providence?

57
00:10:27.612 --> 00:10:28.305
What?

58
00:10:28.305 --> 00:10:31.231
History. Where did it come from?

59
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.987
Oh! I bought it from a guy
he said he got it from his grandmother.


60
00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:34.798
That's all I know.

61
00:10:34.798 --> 00:10:36.924
I've heard that one before.

62
00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:40.297
I tell you what. I want to have my
best appraiser take a look at this.


63
00:10:40.297 --> 00:10:42.361
Shannon here is going to
fill out a receipt for you.


64
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:46.161
And thank you for, uh... choosing Regal Auctioneering.

65
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:47.874
Sure.

66
00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:00.678
I guess that's it.

67
00:11:01.332 --> 00:11:02.165
I guess it is.

68
00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:03.632
Nice game.

69
00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:10.551
How is um... Rick ?

70
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:15.052
I don't know. I haven't spoken to him.
It's over.


71
00:11:15.052 --> 00:11:18.873
What's it been now? 
Six and a half weeks?

72
00:11:18.873 --> 00:11:19.886
Seven.

73
00:11:20.853 --> 00:11:22.640
Are you counting?

74
00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:27.121
I thought. Maybe we, uh...

75
00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:28.740
- What?

76
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.207
I thought maybe we could go out.

77
00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:32.321
We go out all the time.

78
00:11:33.103 --> 00:11:37.812
Yes, we go out all the time,
but we don't "Go Out".


79
00:11:37.812 --> 00:11:38.714
There's a difference.

80
00:11:38.714 --> 00:11:42.412
You are my best friend.
Do you know hard a friend is to find?


81
00:11:42.412 --> 00:11:45.476
I dont wanna...
I do not want to mess that up.


82
00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:46.798
Dates are a dime a dozen.

83
00:11:46.798 --> 00:11:51.133
Aw come on now. It's so old.
It's a date.


84
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.228
Wait. You know what it is?
I'm just...


85
00:11:56.293 --> 00:12:00.073
I'm just worried about losing
what little I've got left now.


86
00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:01.651
Including you.

87
00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.244
How about dinner and a movie?

88
00:12:04.722 --> 00:12:06.906
How about hotdogs and a ball game?

89
00:12:06.906 --> 00:12:09.015
Playing it safe, huh?

90
00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.700
I am going out on a limb here.

91
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.295
I'm casting a spell on you here Alex.

92
00:12:23.397 --> 00:12:25.183
Maybe it'll work.

93
00:12:30.642 --> 00:12:31.856
Hey.

94
00:12:35.752 --> 00:12:37.166
I'll see you later.

95
00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:38.690
I'll be at the lab.

96
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.300
Hey Alex.
Think about what I said.


97
00:13:04.898 --> 00:13:09.190
My god. A fire opal this size.

98
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.455
It's magnificent.

99
00:13:11.697 --> 00:13:14.050
How magnificent?

100
00:13:15.275 --> 00:13:17.493
Excellent translucence.

101
00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:20.186
No other color traces.

102
00:13:23.113 --> 00:13:24.831
It's unique.

103
00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:28.252
Oh that's a good word.
Oh I love that word.


104
00:13:28.252 --> 00:13:30.046
"Unique"

105
00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:32.677
Should that show quite a price? Yeah?

106
00:13:32.677 --> 00:13:34.363
Oh yes.

107
00:13:34.363 --> 00:13:38.292
- I am salivating. Get me a report ASAP?
- Yes.


108
00:13:39.656 --> 00:13:41.076
- Nick?
- Hmm?


109
00:13:41.076 --> 00:13:41.890
Leave.

110
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.911
- Oh, ummm.
- Yes!


111
00:13:57.704 --> 00:13:59.467
What's this?

112
00:14:19.043 --> 00:14:23.347
You woke me.

113
00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:36.063
You woke me.

114
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.324
What?

115
00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.831
I didn't hear you come in,
you scared me. I...


116
00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:05.321
What's the verdict?

117
00:15:06.967 --> 00:15:11.505
I think...  ...there may
be something wrong with it.


118
00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:14.214
Does it affect the value?

119
00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:16.598
I have to talk to a friend of mine.
We're gonna have to run some more tests.


120
00:15:16.598 --> 00:15:20.350
Tests?
Like what? A physical?


121
00:15:35.565 --> 00:15:38.387
- There'something inside of it?
- Right.


122
00:15:40.184 --> 00:15:43.179
I don't know. I'm no gemmologist.

123
00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:47.607
I could run some spectral analysis,
infrared. Get some readings.


124
00:15:47.607 --> 00:15:49.135
That'd be great. 
Can you do it now?

125
00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:53.670
Oh hoh no. Hold on.
I got about two hours worth of


126
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.778
Professor Leiber's bullshit to take of first.
I'll get to it as soon as I can.


127
00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.894
Come on. Do you want to stay?

128
00:15:59.894 --> 00:16:03.384
No, I can't. I have got to put my
girls through their basis.


129
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.814
Thanks. This is really important.
So call me later. Okay?


130
00:16:07.814 --> 00:16:09.995
You're the best Josh.
I owe ya.


131
00:16:10.204 --> 00:16:13.125
Yeah. Well, how about that dinner then?

132
00:16:20.823 --> 00:16:22.173
Time-out.

133
00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:24.927
You.
That was very good.


134
00:16:24.927 --> 00:16:26.543
Very good. Do you know why you missed?

135
00:16:26.543 --> 00:16:27.215
Huh-uh.

136
00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:28.749
You didn't have stillness.

137
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:31.967
All of you can put the ball in the hoops
as long as you take your time.


138
00:16:31.967 --> 00:16:34.175
take a breath.
Get your aim. Right?


139
00:16:34.175 --> 00:16:36.022
But you don't always have
that time in a game.

140
00:16:36.022 --> 00:16:38.650
Somebody is always going to be trying
to take the ball away from you,


141
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.951
and that's when you need stillness.
Not in your body. Your mind.


142
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:45.305
When you get a
chance to make a shot,

143
00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:49.406
you've got to forget about everything else.
Time doesn't exist.


144
00:16:49.406 --> 00:16:51.821
The other players do not exist.

145
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:53.843
It is you and the basket.

146
00:16:54.403 --> 00:16:57.673
You see it, you find it.

147
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:00.991
Shoot the ball.

148
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:16.546
Laser targeting for analysis

149
00:17:25.647 --> 00:17:28.481
Wow. This is the easiest date you
have ever gotten Aickman.


150
00:17:36.616 --> 00:17:38.726
What is that?

151
00:17:42.454 --> 00:17:47.457
You awoke me.

152
00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:55.826
End laser scanning.

153
00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.869
End the laser scan Dammit!

154
00:18:45.128 --> 00:18:48.778
"Hi. Geophysics. We're probably
changing lead into gold right now."


155
00:18:48.778 --> 00:18:50.824
So, leave a message.

156
00:18:52.217 --> 00:18:54.427
Josh, it is Alex,
you are there?


157
00:18:54.427 --> 00:18:56.685
- Josh, something
- Alex


158
00:18:56.685 --> 00:19:00.698
really weird happened to me on the court,
and I really need to talk about it.


159
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.717
Is somebody there?

160
00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:11.624
- Yes.
- Oh my god.


161
00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:34.018
- Is the pain terrible?
- Oh god.


162
00:19:34.018 --> 00:19:35.823
I can help you with that.

163
00:19:37.314 --> 00:19:41.116
I can ease your suffering.

164
00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:46.224
All you have to do is ask.

165
00:19:47.462 --> 00:19:51.009
Tell me you want the pain to cease

166
00:19:54.147 --> 00:19:55.634
Yes.

167
00:19:57.659 --> 00:19:59.761
As you wish.

168
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.730
TopTeo.com

169
00:20:41.218 --> 00:20:44.967
Oh my god...

170
00:21:21.189 --> 00:21:22.503
Josh!

171
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.202
Computer malfunction. It must
have been one hell of a computer.


172
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.946
- Josh.
- Hey!


173
00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:45.566
- Josh. JOSH!
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey miss.


174
00:21:45.766 --> 00:21:47.856
- Hey lady. Lady. Hey hey.
- Josh! Josh!


175
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.305
Is he? Is he?

176
00:21:49.305 --> 00:21:51.213
Get off of me!

177
00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:54.615
I'm sorry.

178
00:21:54.942 --> 00:21:56.391
I'm detective Nathan.

179
00:21:56.391 --> 00:21:57.595
And you are?

180
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.690
Alex Amberson.

181
00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:05.677
Alex Amberson.
Alright? Good.


182
00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:09.785
I take it that you knew the...
um, Josh.


183
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.099
He was my best friend.

184
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.585
I'm sorry.

185
00:22:17.221 --> 00:22:18.873
Look, uh.
You want to have a seat?


186
00:22:18.873 --> 00:22:21.534
No. I want to know what happened.

187
00:22:22.932 --> 00:22:24.749
It looks like an accident.

188
00:22:24.749 --> 00:22:26.927
An equipment malfaunction maybe.

189
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:31.310
You have any idea
what he was working on?

190
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.262
He was analysing...

191
00:22:35.262 --> 00:22:37.492
...a gem stone.

192
00:22:37.492 --> 00:22:39.130
Opal.

193
00:22:39.917 --> 00:22:41.785
For me.

194
00:22:49.842 --> 00:22:52.572
Excuse me lady. Uh.
Help out an old altar boy?


195
00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:54.957
If you ain't got no
change, a dollar will do it.

196
00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:58.115
Hell, I'll even take five.
I'll wait until you get back.


197
00:23:08.189 --> 00:23:10.089
Look. How many times
do I gotta tell you?

198
00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:12.968
Hey, you left customers in there.
That's not a good way to run a business.


199
00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:14.475
Don't tell me how to run my business.

200
00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:15.554
You're a fucking bum.

201
00:23:17.302 --> 00:23:21.434
Well you don't tell me how to run my life.
You're a fucking prick.


202
00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:25.355
I'll talk to anybody I want to.
You don't own this fucking sidewalk.


203
00:23:25.355 --> 00:23:28.232
You wanna know something?
I do own this fucking sidewalk.


204
00:23:28.232 --> 00:23:31.138
You wanna know why?
Because I pay fucking taxes.


205
00:23:31.138 --> 00:23:32.261
Fuck you.

206
00:23:32.261 --> 00:23:34.275
No. Fuck you.

207
00:23:34.275 --> 00:23:37.325
I hope you die, you sack of shit.

208
00:23:37.325 --> 00:23:40.500
I hope you die, and I hope you
float down the gutter


209
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.342
so I can fuck'n piss on ya.

210
00:23:43.342 --> 00:23:47.025
Bald headed baboon.

211
00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:51.633
Piss complected afterbirth
to a Chinese gang banger.


212
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:53.777
Educated idiot!

213
00:23:53.777 --> 00:23:57.409
"I own the sidewalk."
"I pay taxes"


214
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:59.158
I got your taxes swinging.

215
00:23:59.158 --> 00:24:01.715
I tell you what
to do with your taxes.

216
00:24:01.715 --> 00:24:03.671
And I hope they poke a
hole into your kidneys


217
00:24:03.671 --> 00:24:05.660
when they are heading up
towards your throat.


218
00:24:06.973 --> 00:24:10.341
I hope you rot in hell.
And that goes for your...


219
00:24:12.708 --> 00:24:14.209
Who is that?

220
00:24:15.624 --> 00:24:18.206
A friend, perhaps.

221
00:24:18.585 --> 00:24:21.739
Tell me...

222
00:24:22.927 --> 00:24:27.124
Do you really mean those curses
you hurled so freely?


223
00:24:27.983 --> 00:24:30.360
Damned right I did.

224
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.922
What would you do
to have them come true?


225
00:24:35.003 --> 00:24:38.376
A cigarette and a handshake
is about all I got right now pal.


226
00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:42.382
Not quite.
You have a soul.


227
00:24:42.382 --> 00:24:45.898
That, I'd trade for a
shower and a jug of Jack.

228
00:24:45.898 --> 00:24:49.958
Then the death of your
enemy would consider a bargain.

229
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:53.377
You really are fucked up.
You know that?


230
00:24:53.377 --> 00:24:56.519
But I do like the way you think.

231
00:24:56.519 --> 00:25:01.136
Indulge me then.
What would you have happen?


232
00:25:01.136 --> 00:25:03.490
Give it some thought.

233
00:25:04.486 --> 00:25:07.242
Enjoy it.

234
00:25:09.148 --> 00:25:11.785
He should only get cancer.

235
00:25:16.207 --> 00:25:19.318
Should only get cancer and die.

236
00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:21.922
As you wish.

237
00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:24.525
Welfare checks. Food stamps.

238
00:25:24.525 --> 00:25:27.150
And another thing I...

239
00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:30.155
Hey buddy, you Okay?

240
00:25:38.013 --> 00:25:39.492
- You okay?
- I do not know.


241
00:25:41.445 --> 00:25:42.923
Let her. Let her...
Let her go.


242
00:26:02.403 --> 00:26:05.078
Was it worth it?

243
00:26:16.188 --> 00:26:18.334
Run, insect.

244
00:26:18.334 --> 00:26:21.817
Run and tell those you will,
what you will.


245
00:26:21.817 --> 00:26:25.439
Tell them there is something
loose in their city.


246
00:26:26.206 --> 00:26:30.536
Something which feeds on wishes,

247
00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:38.205
but tell them quickly.

248
00:26:38.205 --> 00:26:41.397
while you still have a soul.

249
00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:05.942
Hey.
You're not enjoying it.


250
00:27:05.942 --> 00:27:08.111
Put it out.

251
00:27:13.852 --> 00:27:16.740
I am really sorry about Josh.

252
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.153
I know how close you guys were.

253
00:27:22.485 --> 00:27:26.139
No, we were'nt as close as he wanted,
and now it's just to...


254
00:27:27.018 --> 00:27:29.243
Alex. Listen to me.

255
00:27:29.243 --> 00:27:31.430
What happened to Josh
is not your fault.


256
00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.347
I think it is.

257
00:27:35.347 --> 00:27:36.892
What?

258
00:27:40.963 --> 00:27:46.656
There was something...
...weird, in the opal.


259
00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:49.507
I think that was what exploded.

260
00:27:51.183 --> 00:27:54.171
I think what I gave
Josh is what killed him.

261
00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:57.052
Do you have any idea how
crazy that sounds?


262
00:27:57.971 --> 00:28:03.568
Yes. I know exactly how crazy it sounds.
That's the problem.


263
00:28:08.213 --> 00:28:13.638
Do you, um...
Do you want me to call Dr. Montiglio again?


264
00:28:13.638 --> 00:28:15.593
No.

265
00:28:17.628 --> 00:28:19.209
I'm fine.

266
00:28:19.209 --> 00:28:21.827
I'm just upset.

267
00:28:21.827 --> 00:28:24.426
You're not just upset.

268
00:28:24.426 --> 00:28:27.377
You're imagining things,
just like the last time.


269
00:28:27.377 --> 00:28:29.974
This is nothing like the last time Shannon.

270
00:28:31.244 --> 00:28:32.440
Why don't you go to bed?

271
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.198
I don't want you to worry.

272
00:28:34.198 --> 00:28:37.680
Can you can the "Big Sister Act"
for just one night?


273
00:28:38.062 --> 00:28:41.485
The fire was years ago.
You got me out. Okay?


274
00:28:41.485 --> 00:28:43.274
I got you out.
I didn't get mom out.


275
00:28:43.274 --> 00:28:44.557
I didn't get dad out.

276
00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:47.208
Not "Didn't".
"Couldn't".


277
00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:51.201
Could not. Not your fault.

278
00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:54.504
Just like Josh, it's not your fault Alex.

279
00:28:55.018 --> 00:28:57.347
You really gotta stop
blaming yourself,


280
00:28:57.347 --> 00:28:59.876
or the whole fucking thing
is gonna to start again.


281
00:28:59.876 --> 00:29:02.833
The therapy, the nightmares, everything.

282
00:29:02.833 --> 00:29:04.652
No, it isn't.

283
00:29:07.174 --> 00:29:09.722
It's nothing like last time.

284
00:29:13.317 --> 00:29:15.627
But something's going on.

285
00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:19.285
Something bad.

286
00:29:22.628 --> 00:29:25.722
I'm gonna find out what it is.

287
00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.069
Ready to play, Alex?

288
00:30:13.264 --> 00:30:17.242
I can smell your fear.

289
00:30:27.696 --> 00:30:30.975
I'm looking for a dock worker
named Etchison.


290
00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:33.443
- That's him over there.
- Is that him?


291
00:30:41.015 --> 00:30:43.039
Mr. Etchison?

292
00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:45.848
Sweetheart, you can call me
anything you like.


293
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:48.914
Please. I don't have time for your games.

294
00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:50.282
Well that's a damn shame.

295
00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:51.570
'could be fun.

296
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.552
Oaky. Let's talk about the opal.

297
00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.339
The jewel?

298
00:30:57.339 --> 00:30:59.427
I don't know what you're
talk'n about.


299
00:30:59.427 --> 00:31:03.108
That's odd. Your friend Clegg knew
exactly wat I was talking about.


300
00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:04.356
I don't know him either.

301
00:31:04.356 --> 00:31:05.657
I think you do.

302
00:31:05.882 --> 00:31:10.931
Middle aged guy, runs a pawn shop.
Ratted you out at the first snip of a lawsuit.


303
00:31:12.845 --> 00:31:15.149
Alright. What's the deal?

304
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:16.306
Are you a cop?

305
00:31:16.306 --> 00:31:20.425
No. And we don't ever have to involve
them if you tell me where you got it.


306
00:31:23.628 --> 00:31:26.339
Out of that statue. 
After the accident.

307
00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:29.378
You must have seen it on the news.
It killed a guy.


308
00:31:29.378 --> 00:31:30.889
The Beaumont piece?

309
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.171
How the hell should I know?

310
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:35.107
There was some guy who had
bought it. Yeah.


311
00:31:38.295 --> 00:31:42.305
Hey. Like, give me a couple hndred.
Did I get fucked?


312
00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:45.108
Royally.

313
00:32:38.395 --> 00:32:42.351
Alexandra.
How nice to see you again.


314
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:54.189
Mr. Beaumont, I am so sorry
about what happened.


315
00:32:54.189 --> 00:32:58.133
Yes. Irreplaceable.
One of a kind.


316
00:32:59.892 --> 00:33:03.133
We are talking about Ed Finney,
your assistant, right?


317
00:33:03.133 --> 00:33:06.421
Oh yes.
Yes of course.


318
00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:11.390
Well, if you are not too
broken up about him,


319
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.875
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about the sculpture.


320
00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:15.999
Anything you wish.

321
00:33:16.702 --> 00:33:20.437
Well, the newspapers seem more concerned
with the details of the accident


322
00:33:20.437 --> 00:33:23.283
than a crane operator and such.
- That drunken swine.


323
00:33:23.483 --> 00:33:26.939
and less concerned about
the details of the statue itself.


324
00:33:27.662 --> 00:33:28.920
Was it bejeweled?

325
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.868
No.
No, undecorated.


326
00:33:30.868 --> 00:33:32.315
A likeness of Ahura Mazda.

327
00:33:32.315 --> 00:33:36.023
One of the few to have been made
after the Islamic conversion.


328
00:33:36.868 --> 00:33:38.689
I tell you what. Here uh...

329
00:33:38.689 --> 00:33:41.167
Let me show you something.

330
00:33:41.167 --> 00:33:43.153
You'll be interested in this,
I think.


331
00:33:43.153 --> 00:33:46.104
Any new treasures at the auction house?

332
00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:55.367
Geez!

333
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:57.044
Asshole!

334
00:33:57.044 --> 00:33:58.579
Gotcha.

335
00:34:15.213 --> 00:34:16.656
Wow.

336
00:34:17.036 --> 00:34:20.183
My room of t Lost Gods.

337
00:34:20.544 --> 00:34:24.505
Once worshipped, now...
...forgotten.


338
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:27.983
Every culture of ancient history.

339
00:34:28.516 --> 00:34:30.490
See that?
Down there.


340
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:34.231
That was the space reserved
for Ahura Mazda.


341
00:34:34.231 --> 00:34:38.179
Yes, what exactly is Ahura Mazda?

342
00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:41.098
It's the objects I collect. Alex.

343
00:34:41.098 --> 00:34:42.989
It's not theologies they represent.

344
00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:46.382
But for what it's worth,
he was a monotheistic diety


345
00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:51.474
So he was a god of good then.

346
00:34:51.474 --> 00:34:52.810
Certainly.

347
00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:59.391
Interestingly though, legend has
it that, uh, the opposing force


348
00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:02.265
if you will, is actually his own shadows.

349
00:35:02.265 --> 00:35:06.278
So, in a way, he himself was
the source of evil.


350
00:35:07.676 --> 00:35:10.724
There's someone at the University
I'd like to put you onto.


351
00:35:11.116 --> 00:35:14.922
A very smart woman. She has done some
catalog descriptions for me in the past.


352
00:35:14.922 --> 00:35:20.493
She could be of some help.
Provided you catch her in a good mood.


353
00:35:29.837 --> 00:35:32.143
Hey. Who's the teacher's pet, huh?

354
00:35:33.334 --> 00:35:35.245
Why the hell are you working
in the dark man?


355
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:40.033
Wait a minute. Who are you?

356
00:35:43.913 --> 00:35:45.776
What the fuck?

357
00:35:48.491 --> 00:35:49.581
Oh my g...

358
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:54.717
Am I to understand this is not
something you wish to see?


359
00:35:55.348 --> 00:35:56.634
Uh huh.

360
00:35:56.834 --> 00:35:59.131
Very well.

361
00:36:02.171 --> 00:36:04.791
My eyes!
My eyes!


362
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:09.829
Oh my god.
I can't see.


363
00:36:10.339 --> 00:36:11.840
I can't see.

364
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.096
You bastard!

365
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:17.110
My eyes!

366
00:36:24.902 --> 00:36:26.093
My eyes.

367
00:36:30.847 --> 00:36:31.743
Alex.

368
00:36:34.177 --> 00:36:35.319
Alex!

369
00:36:35.805 --> 00:36:38.874
Alex! Raymond! 
What's the matter?

370
00:36:50.233 --> 00:36:51.379
Sorry.

371
00:36:52.422 --> 00:36:54.688
I don't know what happened.

372
00:36:54.924 --> 00:36:56.072
You fainted.

373
00:36:56.072 --> 00:36:59.567
Can I get you a drink or something?
Some water?


374
00:36:59.567 --> 00:37:01.288
No.

375
00:37:05.769 --> 00:37:06.793
No. I'm fine.

376
00:37:07.362 --> 00:37:10.081
I guess I'm just
under a lot of stress,

377
00:37:11.204 --> 00:37:13.297
but I'm fine. Honestly.

378
00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:14.699
Honestly?

379
00:37:15.779 --> 00:37:19.430
I hope you'll be well enough
to attend my party.


380
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:24.268
What it was, to celebrate my acquisition.

381
00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.329
Your boss, Mr. Merritt
received the invitations.


382
00:37:28.709 --> 00:37:31.834
You and your charming sister
should be most welcome.


383
00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:35.700
Well thank you. I'd like to,

384
00:37:36.602 --> 00:37:38.903
but I think I may be busy.

385
00:37:44.292 --> 00:37:45.252
...little more...

386
00:37:45.252 --> 00:37:47.581
Little more.
Hold on.


387
00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:51.809
- Ah. Back two feet.
- Okay professor.


388
00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:53.193
Good. Good.
That's good.


389
00:37:53.193 --> 00:37:55.729
I told the Dean's office that the
paperwork would be there tomorrow.


390
00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:56.899
I'm Busy.

391
00:37:57.099 --> 00:37:58.715
Okay. Good.

392
00:37:58.948 --> 00:38:00.997
I think you are mistaking
me for someone else.


393
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:05.370
I'm Alex. Raymond Beaumont must
have called you, about me?


394
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.437
Oh yeah. What an
insufferable prick that man is.

395
00:38:08.437 --> 00:38:11.245
Still, it's not your problem.
Unless, of course, you're


396
00:38:11.445 --> 00:38:12.937
stupid enough to be working for him.

397
00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:13.875
No.

398
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:14.711
Or sleeping with him?

399
00:38:14.711 --> 00:38:16.194
Eh-huh.
No.


400
00:38:16.194 --> 00:38:19.575
Oh good. Well that establishes your
discerning good taste.


401
00:38:19.575 --> 00:38:22.380
A little...uh...no, no no no no.
That's not gonna work.


402
00:38:22.989 --> 00:38:24.291
Up stage.

403
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.060
Uh huh? What can I for you?

404
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.282
Absolutely nothing at all, until I
can get your full attention.


405
00:38:31.932 --> 00:38:33.916
I like you.

406
00:38:34.297 --> 00:38:36.038
I'm just interfering here anyway.

407
00:38:36.038 --> 00:38:39.664
This is a, uh, co-production.
Folklore department. That's me.


408
00:38:39.664 --> 00:38:41.977
Drama department. 
That's not me.

409
00:38:41.977 --> 00:38:43.724
As soon as Professor Benson gets here

410
00:38:43.724 --> 00:38:46.447
I'm gonna be run off to him.

411
00:38:47.331 --> 00:38:50.768
The stone of the secret fire was first written
by the Empersia, around


412
00:38:50.768 --> 00:38:52.444
Around 900 years ago.

413
00:38:52.444 --> 00:38:57.021
A court sorcerer is said to have
imprisoned an evil spirit within it.


414
00:38:57.021 --> 00:38:58.345
An evil spirit?

415
00:38:58.345 --> 00:39:01.806
Yes. A creature from the
spaces between the worlds.


416
00:39:02.853 --> 00:39:04.271
A Djinn.

417
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:05.814
A Djinn?

418
00:39:06.405 --> 00:39:07.273
A genie?

419
00:39:07.273 --> 00:39:11.876
Now hold on a minute. Froget what our
culture has made of the Djinn.


420
00:39:11.876 --> 00:39:13.242
Forget Barbars Eden.

421
00:39:13.242 --> 00:39:14.591
Forget Robin Williams.

422
00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:19.278
To the peoples of ancient Arabia,
the Djinn was not cute nor funny.


423
00:39:19.278 --> 00:39:21.605
It was something else entirely.

424
00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:23.906
It was the face of fear itself.

425
00:39:24.765 --> 00:39:26.307
How's it look?

426
00:39:29.144 --> 00:39:30.357
You tell me.

427
00:39:39.665 --> 00:39:41.213
Wow.

428
00:39:41.182 --> 00:39:42.779
I'm glad you approve.

429
00:39:44.932 --> 00:39:47.401
Um. You want to try something else?

430
00:39:47.401 --> 00:39:50.293
A different style maybe?
Tighter?


431
00:39:50.293 --> 00:39:53.635
Oh, no. Don't like feeling confined.

432
00:39:53.635 --> 00:39:55.258
I had enough of that.

433
00:39:55.804 --> 00:39:58.592
Okay then, follow me.

434
00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.224
Now, will this be cash or charge Mr....?

435
00:40:18.224 --> 00:40:20.936
Demerest.
Nathaniel Demerest


436
00:40:20.936 --> 00:40:22.470
Call Me Nathaniel.

437
00:40:22.776 --> 00:40:25.605
Okay Nathaniel.
Cash or charge?


438
00:40:25.605 --> 00:40:27.853
Which would you prefer?

439
00:40:29.644 --> 00:40:31.701
I don't know?
Cash?


440
00:40:31.701 --> 00:40:32.959
Done.

441
00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:34.475
Oh.

442
00:40:37.903 --> 00:40:41.625
This is my first day in your world.
Ariella


443
00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:45.096
I am pleased to
see beauty as a constant.

444
00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:49.347
Does it bother you... knowing that
your beauty will fade?


445
00:40:50.016 --> 00:40:54.855
That your looking glass will day by day
tell you a long and unhappy story?


446
00:40:57.606 --> 00:41:04.057
Well. I mean... That's life. Right?
It happens to all of us.


447
00:41:04.057 --> 00:41:04.902
Like it or not.

448
00:41:04.902 --> 00:41:06.372
It doesn't have to, Ariella.

449
00:41:06.372 --> 00:41:07.703
Ask.

450
00:41:08.108 --> 00:41:10.712
Ask and see what happens.

451
00:41:10.712 --> 00:41:14.191
Ask for an end to change.
An end to decay.


452
00:41:14.191 --> 00:41:17.484
Say, "I wish to be beautiful forever."

453
00:41:19.717 --> 00:41:22.603
I wish to be beautiful forever.

454
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:25.720
Pleasure doing business with you.

455
00:41:36.817 --> 00:41:40.427
Soon I will find you.

456
00:41:40.841 --> 00:41:43.750
...would you like to
do this some other time?

457
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.847
No.  I'm a... I'm...

458
00:41:47.847 --> 00:41:49.117
AH!

459
00:41:52.103 --> 00:41:54.689
I just wanted Professor Derleth
to check out my costume.


460
00:41:55.113 --> 00:41:56.871
Well obviously it's scary enough.

461
00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:58.620
Go back to rehearsal.

462
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:01.578
Thanks.

463
00:42:03.364 --> 00:42:04.716
You alright?

464
00:42:05.824 --> 00:42:06.735
Yes.

465
00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:11.343
Okay. The Djinn, the word is both
plural and singular by the way,


466
00:42:11.343 --> 00:42:14.785
are a race created after the angels,
but before mankind.


467
00:42:14.785 --> 00:42:17.563
Powerful. Magical. Evil.

468
00:42:17.963 --> 00:42:19.562
Evil?

469
00:42:20.882 --> 00:42:24.023
I though that genies granted wishes.
That's what the myths say.


470
00:42:24.023 --> 00:42:29.340
They're obliged, but their true motivation is
always usurping this world for themselves.


471
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.446
I never heard that.
What I heard was...


472
00:42:31.446 --> 00:42:32.653
A sweetened fable.

473
00:42:33.207 --> 00:42:36.215
Over the centuries, faith became fairytales.

474
00:42:36.215 --> 00:42:40.167
We avoided our terror by taming
it into fictions and inventing stories


475
00:42:40.167 --> 00:42:42.732
of magical lamps to rock our
children to sleep.


476
00:42:42.988 --> 00:42:44.893
And the old stories are darker.

477
00:42:44.893 --> 00:42:46.646
Much darker.

478
00:42:47.619 --> 00:42:51.227
In the old writings, the Djinn is everything
that we ever feared.


479
00:42:51.227 --> 00:42:55.667
An utterly inhuman race of beings,
that mean us harm.


480
00:42:56.207 --> 00:42:57.778
Older than our oldest history.

481
00:42:57.778 --> 00:43:00.294
More powerful than our worst imagining

482
00:43:00.294 --> 00:43:03.322
and driven by an ancient and endless malevolence.

483
00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.181
Detective Nathanson.

484
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:22.366
Yeah?

485
00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:25.795
I was told downstairs you were in
charge of the Aickman investigation.


486
00:43:26.071 --> 00:43:27.304
I was.

487
00:43:30.961 --> 00:43:34.882
The case is closed. At least as far as
homicide is concerned.


488
00:43:34.882 --> 00:43:36.776
Unless you got something to tell me.

489
00:43:36.776 --> 00:43:39.623
Actually, I was hoping you
had something to tell me.


490
00:43:39.623 --> 00:43:42.950
Oh, really? And what would that be?

491
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.890
Nothing much.
An address.


492
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.819
A woman called Alexandra.

493
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:51.908
What the hell makes you think
I can give you her address?


494
00:43:54.628 --> 00:43:57.181
What's your interest in this case anyway?

495
00:43:58.464 --> 00:44:00.621
Why do you keep looking over there?

496
00:44:00.621 --> 00:44:04.351
You see that guy?
Guilty as sin.


497
00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:07.040
Walked on 7 counts.
Walked each time.


498
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.204
Made of teflon makes me sick.
You know what I would like?


499
00:44:10.204 --> 00:44:11.473
I'd love to know.

500
00:44:12.907 --> 00:44:15.908
Just once I'd like it to be easy.
I would like to nail that prick


501
00:44:15.908 --> 00:44:16.687
Dent to the rights.

502
00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:19.962
Murder One. Everybody's an eyewitness.

503
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.753
Alexandra

504
00:44:59.065 --> 00:45:00.405
Hey! You!

505
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.730
TopTeo.com

506
00:45:46.518 --> 00:45:48.505
The stone of the secret fire

507
00:45:48.505 --> 00:45:52.436
created by a great Persian sorcerer
to save his people from the Djinn.


508
00:45:52.436 --> 00:45:54.445
is as much a curse as a blessing.

509
00:45:54.445 --> 00:45:57.203
because it is a doorway between the worlds.

510
00:45:57.203 --> 00:45:59.989
And like all doors, can be opened
from either side.


511
00:46:00.189 --> 00:46:04.458
Adjinn, once freed, can use the stone
to bring forth his race to our reality,


512
00:46:04.458 --> 00:46:06.408
and overwhelm humanity.

513
00:46:06.802 --> 00:46:10.328
But the Djinn must first charge the stone
by gathering the souls of humans


514
00:46:10.528 --> 00:46:12.273
who have had a single wish granted...

515
00:46:12.265 --> 00:46:15.422
He must then activate it,
by finding the human who woke him


516
00:46:15.422 --> 00:46:18.300
into this world, and granting
him 3 wishes.


517
00:46:18.417 --> 00:46:21.861
The sole limitation to the Djinn's
power is that it may only be


518
00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:23.690
used in the service of wishes.

519
00:46:35.622 --> 00:46:36.981
Sorry sir. We're closed.

520
00:46:36.981 --> 00:46:39.315
I am trying to locate an employee.

521
00:46:40.001 --> 00:46:42.493
- No on here. Just the boss.
- Alright, I'll talk to the boss.


522
00:46:42.493 --> 00:46:44.049
Open the doors please.

523
00:46:44.049 --> 00:46:46.507
It's appointments only
after business hours. Okay?


524
00:46:46.779 --> 00:46:48.607
You're becoming a bother little man.

525
00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:49.725
Open

526
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:51.262
the doors.

527
00:46:55.996 --> 00:46:57.997
Okay pal. It is
time for you to go.

528
00:47:00.942 --> 00:47:02.692
Get out of my way.

529
00:47:03.314 --> 00:47:05.005
I don't think so asshole.

530
00:47:06.174 --> 00:47:09.501
Do you have any idea how frustrating
it is to have unlimited power,


531
00:47:09.501 --> 00:47:13.217
and only be able to use it when some
worm asks you for something?


532
00:47:13.217 --> 00:47:16.916
No. I can't say that I do.
I can't say I give a shit either.


533
00:47:16.916 --> 00:47:18.627
Ask me for something.

534
00:47:18.627 --> 00:47:22.238
Okay.
I want you to leave.


535
00:47:25.897 --> 00:47:31.141
No. No.
I have to get inside.


536
00:47:31.141 --> 00:47:33.739
Well now, you's have to go through me.

537
00:47:35.266 --> 00:47:37.437
And that is something
I would love to see.

538
00:48:09.855 --> 00:48:11.994
Who the hell are you?
How'd you get in here?


539
00:48:12.909 --> 00:48:14.994
The guard opened up on me.

540
00:48:15.724 --> 00:48:17.858
I wonder if I could ask your help.

541
00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:22.837
I'm looking for Alexandra Amberson.

542
00:48:22.837 --> 00:48:28.022
Ale.. Sh.. She, she was off today.
I asked you who you were.


543
00:48:28.022 --> 00:48:29.923
Someone she's expecting.

544
00:48:29.923 --> 00:48:32.516
Prehaps you'd be so kind as to
give me her home address.


545
00:48:33.674 --> 00:48:38.274
Wait a minute. If she knows you,
how come you don't have her address?


546
00:48:38.756 --> 00:48:41.890
I said she's expecting me.
I didn't say she knows me.


547
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:46.422
Oh. Well in that case, um.
Maybe you better e-mail her,


548
00:48:46.422 --> 00:48:50.227
because I can't give you her address.
You understand.


549
00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.876
Perfectly.

550
00:48:52.564 --> 00:48:54.452
Would you happen to know
where she is right now?


551
00:48:54.452 --> 00:48:55.906
Yes. I would.

552
00:48:55.906 --> 00:48:59.244
- would you tell me?
- No. I wouldn't.


553
00:49:05.728 --> 00:49:08.114
Hey, hey!
That's a very valuable piece.


554
00:49:09.434 --> 00:49:10.842
Really?

555
00:49:11.719 --> 00:49:14.486
You would like it to be 100
times its valuable?


556
00:49:16.428 --> 00:49:18.799
Would I like it to be 100
times more valuable?


557
00:49:18.999 --> 00:49:20.196
Yes.

558
00:49:29.338 --> 00:49:30.987
Holy shit.

559
00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:35.189
What are you,
David Copperfield or something?


560
00:49:35.189 --> 00:49:36.163
How'd you do that?

561
00:49:36.163 --> 00:49:38.694
Old family secret.

562
00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:41.121
Where is Alexandra?

563
00:49:41.121 --> 00:49:48.873
Ahhh. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't
really feel, um, comfortable telling you.


564
00:49:49.049 --> 00:49:50.989
What would make you
comfortable Nick?


565
00:49:51.412 --> 00:49:52.902
Name it.

566
00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:54.992
What's my limit?

567
00:49:55.408 --> 00:49:56.773
Your imagination.

568
00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:02.341
Well, I am not a greedy man...
How about a million dollars?


569
00:50:04.767 --> 00:50:05.792
Done.

570
00:50:07.261 --> 00:50:08.997
Let's just see.

571
00:50:11.152 --> 00:50:14.264
Oh. Wait a minute. You forgotten
to fill in the beneficiary.


572
00:50:14.264 --> 00:50:17.499
Oh silly. It's my son Nick.

573
00:50:18.454 --> 00:50:21.824
He owns a very
prestigious auction house.


574
00:50:21.824 --> 00:50:26.079
There you go. Thanks for your business
Mrs. Merritt. Enjoy your flight.


575
00:50:33.365 --> 00:50:35.904
Hey. Yourself.

576
00:50:36.389 --> 00:50:37.633
What the hell are you doing?

577
00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:39.563
Learning the rules of the game.

578
00:50:39.934 --> 00:50:43.547
I leave work early to get you back
the car, and you're not even ready.


579
00:50:43.747 --> 00:50:45.012
Um Hm.

580
00:50:45.212 --> 00:50:47.263
Basketball?

581
00:50:47.263 --> 00:50:51.495
Damn.
I lost track of time.


582
00:50:51.495 --> 00:50:55.188
Okay. Just uh.
Just give me a second. Okay?


583
00:51:10.661 --> 00:51:14.985
Okay. That was great.
Come on everybody. Let's take a five.


584
00:51:16.837 --> 00:51:19.544
Stillness Miss Amberson.
That's how I did it.


585
00:51:19.744 --> 00:51:21.037
Stillness. Just like you said.

586
00:51:21.237 --> 00:51:23.482
Yes. Go
Go.


587
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.072
Can I have your phone again?

588
00:51:27.274 --> 00:51:30.970
God. Who is this woman anyway?

589
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.107
Damn, it's a machine.

590
00:51:43.854 --> 00:51:46.657
Professor Derleth, this is Alex.
Again.


591
00:51:46.657 --> 00:51:51.341
I really need to talk to you as
soon as possible. Please call me back.


592
00:51:51.911 --> 00:51:53.649
Thank you.

593
00:51:58.243 --> 00:51:59.791
Excuse me miss.

594
00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:01.944
Do you mind terribly
if I borrow your phone?

595
00:52:02.579 --> 00:52:04.211
I'd be happy to pay for the call.

596
00:52:04.532 --> 00:52:05.751
That's Okay.

597
00:52:19.098 --> 00:52:22.132
Alright. That ought to keep
you from tripping. Go.


598
00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.127
Nobody home.

599
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:31.911
Useful little items, arent they?

600
00:53:45.958 --> 00:53:50.118
I claim that, which is old.

601
00:53:54.656 --> 00:53:56.834
- Hello.
- Miss Amberson


602
00:53:56.834 --> 00:54:00.753
It's detective Nathanson.
We need to talk.


603
00:54:07.646 --> 00:54:11.305
There was a guy here looking for you.
I think...


604
00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:38.192
Only you can end their pain Alexandra.
Only you can free them.


605
00:55:45.976 --> 00:55:49.663
Patience, friends.

606
00:55:49.663 --> 00:55:53.383
Patience.

607
00:56:08.147 --> 00:56:11.353
Hi, Uh... Can I come in?

608
00:56:16.632 --> 00:56:21.221
The stone is charged. It's charged with
people's souls, fed with their fear.


609
00:56:21.713 --> 00:56:24.095
And the Djinn is after me.
I need to know what the hell to do.


610
00:56:24.095 --> 00:56:26.250
Alexandra, this is the 20th century.

611
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.818
Don't you think all that sounds
a little unlikely?


612
00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.902
Would you like something to drink,
by the way?


613
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:35.834
No.
Thank you.


614
00:56:35.834 --> 00:56:37.696
Well, I would.

615
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:40.743
This is a nice cabinet, isn't it?

616
00:56:41.554 --> 00:56:43.689
Your boss would really like this.

617
00:56:43.689 --> 00:56:46.215
My boss? I never told
you who I work for.

618
00:56:47.497 --> 00:56:48.853
You didn't?

619
00:56:52.294 --> 00:56:53.545
Then how would I know?

620
00:56:55.318 --> 00:56:56.778
Maybe Beaumont mentioned it?

621
00:56:57.297 --> 00:56:59.623
Oh, yeah!
He did.


622
00:57:03.034 --> 00:57:05.063
Let me explain.

623
00:57:05.063 --> 00:57:08.445
You are obviously looking for some piece
of magic. Some spell


624
00:57:08.445 --> 00:57:12.158
to get rid of this hypothetical Djinn
that you're talking about. right?


625
00:57:12.358 --> 00:57:14.054
Yes.

626
00:57:16.068 --> 00:57:18.577
They certainly existed.

627
00:57:18.777 --> 00:57:20.865
- You are cold?
- No, I'm fine.


628
00:57:21.073 --> 00:57:22.429
Would you like me
to put the heat on?

629
00:57:22.742 --> 00:57:24.723
No. Just please continue.

630
00:57:25.149 --> 00:57:26.986
Alright...

631
00:57:27.186 --> 00:57:28.186
Where was I?

632
00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:32.368
Oh yeah! Spells, sorcerers.
Alexandra.


633
00:57:32.368 --> 00:57:36.697
You were born into an age of reason
and an age of science.


634
00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:39.738
All the sorcerers are dead

635
00:57:39.947 --> 00:57:43.865
and all the spells lost, to time.

636
00:57:44.065 --> 00:57:47.236
But the Djinn itself.
The Djinn, if it existed.


637
00:57:47.236 --> 00:57:50.214
Would be all there was.

638
00:57:50.656 --> 00:57:52.361
Imagine that.

639
00:57:52.561 --> 00:57:55.796
The only magical thing
in a rationalist world.


640
00:57:56.943 --> 00:58:00.176
A vulnerable world of disbelief.

641
00:58:00.697 --> 00:58:03.930
Where no reason would ever rescue you.

642
00:58:04.138 --> 00:58:06.432
Nor Science save you.

643
00:58:09.978 --> 00:58:12.689
He would have a fine old time.
Wouldn't he?


644
00:58:14.983 --> 00:58:16.262
This is no joke.

645
00:58:16.262 --> 00:58:18.981
No, it's not funny.

646
00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:20.973
Are you hungry?

647
00:58:22.595 --> 00:58:24.853
I'm not hungry. I'm not thirsty.
I'm not...


648
00:58:25.053 --> 00:58:28.126
Why do you keep trying
to do things for m...?


649
00:58:38.965 --> 00:58:40.321
I'm sorry.

650
00:58:41.259 --> 00:58:43.898
I guess I'm just a little tense.

651
00:58:49.706 --> 00:58:50.540
I guess.

652
00:58:52.625 --> 00:58:53.981
But I'm fine.

653
00:58:54.596 --> 00:58:56.051
Alright.

654
00:58:57.403 --> 00:58:58.834
Where were we?

655
00:58:58.834 --> 00:59:00.862
Oh, yes.

656
00:59:01.756 --> 00:59:03.560
No spells.

657
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.356
No hope.

658
00:59:05.556 --> 00:59:08.371
If there's no hope. No magic.

659
00:59:10.352 --> 00:59:12.020
I'll have to rely on myself.

660
00:59:14.835 --> 00:59:17.859
Match wits with a creature older than time.

661
00:59:18.694 --> 00:59:22.030
Match wits with a prince
of the Dark Dominions.


662
00:59:22.969 --> 00:59:27.690
Pit your tiny 20th century brain
against one that walked


663
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:30.212
the spaces between the worlds,

664
00:59:30.944 --> 00:59:34.959
and trod the wings of angels
beneath his concrete feet.


665
00:59:34.959 --> 00:59:42.558
Oh Alexandra, you're a delight.
Really. You are.


666
00:59:44.439 --> 00:59:45.283
I'm glad I can amuse you.

667
00:59:46.056 --> 00:59:50.470
Oh. I hurt your feelings.
I'm sorry.


668
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:52.319
Let me make it up to you.

669
00:59:53.036 --> 00:59:54.459
What can I do?

670
00:59:56.441 --> 00:59:57.483
I must be going now.

671
01:00:01.237 --> 01:00:02.905
Sit down!

672
01:00:06.138 --> 01:00:07.493
Please.

673
01:00:08.015 --> 01:00:09.475
Sit down.

674
01:00:14.063 --> 01:00:14.897
Where's Wendy?

675
01:00:15.105 --> 01:00:18.511
Bedroom.
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.


676
01:00:18.964 --> 01:00:21.790
Messy.
I needed her face.


677
01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:23.134
You killed her?

678
01:00:23.343 --> 01:00:27.305
Actually, I can't kill anyone.
Not unless they wish me to.


679
01:00:27.931 --> 01:00:29.704
Your research should have told you that.

680
01:00:29.912 --> 01:00:31.858
She didn't wish to be dead

681
01:00:31.858 --> 01:00:34.238
You lying sack of shit!

682
01:00:34.438 --> 01:00:38.410
I showed her my true face.
Her reaction wasn't very flattering.


683
01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:42.258
As a matter of fact,
she got down right hysterical.


684
01:00:45.358 --> 01:00:49.805
I merely asked her if she if she wished
to be released from her fear.


685
01:00:52.227 --> 01:00:55.650
You're a dangerous person to know,
Alexandra.


686
01:00:56.702 --> 01:00:59.004
Your scientist friend. Your boss.

687
01:00:59.213 --> 01:01:01.194
The policemen. Wendy.

688
01:01:02.133 --> 01:01:03.720
By the bye.

689
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:07.868
Where is that tasty little sister
of yours today?


690
01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.863
If you harm Shannon

691
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.604
I kill to you.

692
01:01:15.167 --> 01:01:17.148
Spare me child.

693
01:01:17.669 --> 01:01:19.859
Behold my true face.

694
01:01:20.059 --> 01:01:21.154
Oh my god.

695
01:01:21.154 --> 01:01:25.386
Yes.
The shit just hit the fan. Didn't it?


696
01:01:25.907 --> 01:01:28.307
Let's get this over with, shall we?

697
01:01:28.507 --> 01:01:32.004
Make your wishes.

698
01:01:33.727 --> 01:01:36.110
Three wishes Alexandra.

699
01:01:36.543 --> 01:01:40.774
Doesn't that intrigue you?
Just a little?


700
01:01:41.861 --> 01:01:43.112
Anything you want.

701
01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:46.045
- Anything?
- You ask for anything


702
01:01:46.045 --> 01:01:48.847
I must grant it.

703
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.042
A trip to the moon.
A visit to Cairo Egypt.


704
01:01:54.242 --> 01:01:56.179
What happens if I wished you dead?

705
01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:58.857
Why, how remarkably original
Alexandra.


706
01:01:58.857 --> 01:02:03.550
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one free wish.


707
01:02:04.384 --> 01:02:09.518
A sample. Get you into the
spirit of the game.


708
01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:13.038
Alright. I want you to destroy yourself.

709
01:02:13.247 --> 01:02:14.897
Blow your brains out.

710
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.817
RIGHT NOW!

711
01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:18.539
Very well.

712
01:02:24.821 --> 01:02:27.950
That which is eternal cannot die.

713
01:02:28.367 --> 01:02:33.372
But if it's any consolation sweet Alex,
that hurt like hell.


714
01:02:34.294 --> 01:02:40.784
Now.
Make your three wishes.


715
01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:45.155
I always tell my girls
to know their opponent.


716
01:02:51.744 --> 01:02:53.312
So...

717
01:02:54.122 --> 01:02:56.103
I think I will, make a wish.

718
01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.330
Good.

719
01:02:58.330 --> 01:02:59.857
I wish...

720
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:04.028
to know what you are.

721
01:03:07.573 --> 01:03:09.137
What are doing?

722
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:12.906
Granting your wish.

723
01:03:25.404 --> 01:03:28.640
You wish to know what I am.

724
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.348
To you, I am this.

725
01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:35.285
The cry of the abandoned child.

726
01:03:35.552 --> 01:03:37.949
The winter of the whipped beast

727
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.595
I am the face that stares back
at you from the shadow


728
01:03:42.595 --> 01:03:44.534
do you mirrror?

729
01:03:44.975 --> 01:03:47.612
The hollowness, at the heart of all

730
01:03:47.612 --> 01:03:50.013
your hopes, Alexandra.

731
01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:55.905
I am despair.

732
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:12.900
Shit.

733
01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:18.421
'careful what you wish for.

734
01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:03.119
So. How do you like me so far?

735
01:05:03.319 --> 01:05:06.279
I didn't wish for this.
You're supposed to be outside.


736
01:05:06.279 --> 01:05:07.724
You're not supposed to be here.

737
01:05:07.965 --> 01:05:10.640
I am bound by that which I bind.

738
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.181
Contained and by that which I contain.

739
01:05:14.181 --> 01:05:16.035
This isn't what I wanted.

740
01:05:16.035 --> 01:05:20.953
Well then. Word your
wishes more carefully.


741
01:05:27.302 --> 01:05:32.132
Oh Alexandra. You left
your sister all alone.


742
01:05:32.132 --> 01:05:36.163
Not to worry. I'll find her and
keep her company.


743
01:05:36.267 --> 01:05:37.855
Don't you go near her.

744
01:05:37.855 --> 01:05:39.319
I mighr have to.

745
01:05:39.324 --> 01:05:44.168
You know how persuasive the
pain of loved ones can be.


746
01:05:44.761 --> 01:05:45.368
No.

747
01:05:51.908 --> 01:05:55.349
Stop me then.
Wish yourself back.


748
01:05:55.766 --> 01:06:00.062
I wish I was in my apartment.
Right now. Without you.


749
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.468
Shannon?

750
01:06:11.303 --> 01:06:15.851
Shannon, where are you?
We got to get out of here.


751
01:06:22.832 --> 01:06:26.018
Alex. Waited as long as I could.
Gone to Beaumont's party.


752
01:06:26.018 --> 01:06:27.668
Join us if you can!
Shannon.


753
01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:34.458
Two wishes in. 
We're so connected now.

754
01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:39.722
Wherever you go, there I'll be.
Wherever you are, I will find you.


755
01:06:40.812 --> 01:06:42.272
FUCK YOU!

756
01:07:09.696 --> 01:07:12.230
Going my way?

757
01:07:44.419 --> 01:07:47.113
Excuse me ma'am. Ah..
Is your name on the list?


758
01:07:47.113 --> 01:07:50.406
You have got to help me.
This guy is crazy. He's dangerous.


759
01:07:50.406 --> 01:07:52.584
He broke my window.
He is trying to kill me.


760
01:08:04.022 --> 01:08:08.688
Excuse me sir.
Is Mr. Beaumont expecting you?


761
01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:12.260
I asked you a question.
Sir.


762
01:08:13.407 --> 01:08:15.805
Am I expected? Yes.

763
01:08:16.014 --> 01:08:18.203
I wouldn't be here, if it weren't
for Mr. Beaumont.


764
01:08:18.412 --> 01:08:20.228
Well that sounds good.

765
01:08:20.974 --> 01:08:23.106
But it doesn't sound like an invitation.

766
01:08:23.106 --> 01:08:26.416
I don't care what it sounds like.
Step aside.


767
01:08:26.566 --> 01:08:28.708
Let me make this real simple for you.

768
01:08:28.708 --> 01:08:32.176
If your name isn't on the list,
you don't get in.


769
01:08:34.157 --> 01:08:35.930
I've dealt with your type before.

770
01:08:36.243 --> 01:08:39.684
Mister, you've never even
met my type before.


771
01:08:39.997 --> 01:08:43.855
I am going through that door,
and you will not to stop me.


772
01:08:44.063 --> 01:08:46.625
Is that perfectly clear,
doorman?


773
01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:49.694
Doorman? The name is Valentine.

774
01:08:49.798 --> 01:08:51.988
Johnny Valentine.

775
01:08:52.509 --> 01:08:54.073
You remember that when they ask

776
01:08:54.282 --> 01:08:55.950
how you lost your eye.

777
01:08:56.055 --> 01:08:58.244
Forgive my brassness.

778
01:08:58.453 --> 01:09:03.155
My eagerness for the end game has skewed
my judgement. I'll make you a deal.


779
01:09:03.155 --> 01:09:05.097
I don't make deals.

780
01:09:05.097 --> 01:09:06.690
What else do you have to do?

781
01:09:07.108 --> 01:09:11.475
Tonight.
Keep assholes out of parties.


782
01:09:11.475 --> 01:09:13.573
And what about tomorrow?

783
01:09:13.781 --> 01:09:16.477
Surely you are not telling
me this is all you can do.


784
01:09:17.848 --> 01:09:20.017
Nor all you ever have done.

785
01:09:20.559 --> 01:09:23.270
It certainly isn't all you ever wished for.

786
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.796
Tell me the truth. Don't you grow weary
of this job, day in and day out?


787
01:09:29.422 --> 01:09:32.804
Wouldn't you like to escape to
a more exciting profession?


788
01:09:32.804 --> 01:09:35.597
What the FUCK does that have
to do with you?


789
01:09:35.597 --> 01:09:37.034
Everything.

790
01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:41.309
Take the chance Johnny.
Answer the question.


791
01:09:41.622 --> 01:09:45.250
Would you like to escape?

792
01:09:48.556 --> 01:09:50.110
Yeah.

793
01:09:50.694 --> 01:09:52.990
As you wish.

794
01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:01.434
Houdini did it in
two and a half minutes.

795
01:10:20.274 --> 01:10:22.032
Excuse me.

796
01:10:27.454 --> 01:10:29.663
Excuse me.
Excuse me.


797
01:10:33.888 --> 01:10:34.908
Shannon?

798
01:10:35.896 --> 01:10:37.317
Sorry.

799
01:10:48.815 --> 01:10:50.584
Alex, I didn't know you were com...
What are you doing?


800
01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:52.407
I'm trying to get you outta here.
Come on. We gotta go.


801
01:10:52.407 --> 01:10:53.431
Get the hell off of me.

802
01:10:53.431 --> 01:10:55.091
Shannon. We have got to leave now.

803
01:10:55.091 --> 01:10:56.158
Trust me.

804
01:10:56.158 --> 01:11:00.348
No. Trust me. you obviously haven't
seen Beaumont's new friend.


805
01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:02.897
You remember the guy from
the basketball court?


806
01:11:09.205 --> 01:11:11.232
Shannon.
Shannon!


807
01:11:11.432 --> 01:11:14.190
...and I was at Cindy's party, of course,
the one where they served the


808
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.019
divorce papers in the middle of dinner.
It was hysterical.


809
01:11:18.019 --> 01:11:19.545
People talked about it for a year.

810
01:11:19.545 --> 01:11:20.577
Really?

811
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:26.234
I remember a certain potentate date, whose
last party was talked about for centuries.


812
01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:29.425
What do you mean,
it went down in history?

813
01:11:29.625 --> 01:11:30.625
Yes.

814
01:11:31.005 --> 01:11:34.380
God, how I'd love to
host a party like that.


815
01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:36.658
Shannon!

816
01:11:41.369 --> 01:11:42.788
As you wish.

817
01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:48.569
Ted, you can see right through me.

818
01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.167
My God.

819
01:12:48.375 --> 01:12:50.878
Not yet, human.

820
01:12:51.087 --> 01:12:55.049
Soon. Very soon I will be...

821
01:13:07.624 --> 01:13:09.424
Shannon?

822
01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:22.566
Shannon!

823
01:13:30.832 --> 01:13:33.382
Perimeter! Everybody get to the house now!

824
01:13:33.382 --> 01:13:34.674
Shannon!

825
01:14:12.838 --> 01:14:16.769
We have unfinished business.

826
01:14:16.769 --> 01:14:17.946
It's going to stay unfinished.

827
01:14:19.744 --> 01:14:22.743
Listen to their screams child.

828
01:14:23.558 --> 01:14:27.956
Listen to their music of their agony.

829
01:14:29.342 --> 01:14:30.250
You Bastard!

830
01:14:30.578 --> 01:14:33.796
You can save them, Alexandra.

831
01:14:34.993 --> 01:14:37.550
Just wish it away.

832
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:41.100
No. I won't.
I can't.


833
01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.960
My patience wears thin.

834
01:14:49.678 --> 01:14:52.669
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

835
01:14:53.196 --> 01:14:54.755
Where's your third wish then?

836
01:14:55.466 --> 01:14:58.404
I don't need you dead Alexandra.

837
01:14:58.948 --> 01:15:01.949
I just need you
to wish you were a...

838
01:14:59.730 --> 01:15:04.730
TopTeo.com

839
01:15:11.944 --> 01:15:15.701
Run...
...Run


840
01:15:28.946 --> 01:15:31.673
- Raymond.
- Alex. Alex, what is going on here?


841
01:15:31.673 --> 01:15:34.649
Shannon.
Raymond. Have you seen Shannon?


842
01:15:34.649 --> 01:15:37.838
Raymond. Raymond?

843
01:15:38.038 --> 01:15:39.389
Gosh, Raymond?

844
01:16:52.789 --> 01:16:55.892
Hey miss. Come with us.
We're trying to get this under control.


845
01:16:55.892 --> 01:16:58.320
Get out of here.
Get OUT!


846
01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.516
He's coming!

847
01:18:04.115 --> 01:18:07.440
Please. We have got to go!
We have got to...


848
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.216
it's not going to do any good!

849
01:18:33.079 --> 01:18:35.378
Shannon!

850
01:19:02.299 --> 01:19:06.060
No more doors.
No more rooms.


851
01:19:06.436 --> 01:19:08.986
No more excuses.

852
01:19:09.186 --> 01:19:11.583
Make your wish.

853
01:19:11.783 --> 01:19:12.727
I will not wish.

854
01:19:13.379 --> 01:19:14.916
Really?

855
01:19:15.855 --> 01:19:20.443
Not even when I show you the
latest addition to Beaumont's collection.


856
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:24.181
The final flowering of his wish.

857
01:19:24.181 --> 01:19:24.354
What?

858
01:19:24.614 --> 01:19:27.012
A little masterpiece of my own.

859
01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:30.036
I call it "SISTER".

860
01:19:30.662 --> 01:19:33.706
"WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"

861
01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:35.161
Oh god.

862
01:19:37.399 --> 01:19:38.405
Shannon!

863
01:19:38.405 --> 01:19:40.950
Rather a good likeness,
don't you think?


864
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:42.879
I especially relish...

865
01:19:43.597 --> 01:19:46.094
the 'trapped-animal' look in the eyes.

866
01:19:46.303 --> 01:19:49.732
You vicious son of a BITCH!

867
01:19:49.932 --> 01:19:51.766
You don't approve?

868
01:19:52.308 --> 01:19:53.614
Alright then.

869
01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:54.666
FUCK IT!

870
01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:56.521
You know what I say?

871
01:19:56.730 --> 01:20:02.044
If you can't beat them,
burn them baby.


872
01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.203
Oh no.

873
01:20:12.758 --> 01:20:14.481
Shannon!

874
01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:16.408
Remind you of something?

875
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:27.714
Make your wish.

876
01:20:34.114 --> 01:20:37.683
I suggest you do it quickly, dear.

877
01:20:45.214 --> 01:20:47.040
Oh god.

878
01:20:57.226 --> 01:20:59.003
Stillness...

879
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:08.871
I wish...

880
01:21:09.071 --> 01:21:10.745
Yes?

881
01:21:20.237 --> 01:21:20.670
I wish...

882
01:21:21.295 --> 01:21:22.234
Wish on, child.

883
01:21:23.042 --> 01:21:24.401
Stillness...

884
01:21:31.656 --> 01:21:36.351
I wish Mickey Torelli hadn't been
drinking on the job, 2 days ago.


885
01:21:42.813 --> 01:21:44.172
No.

886
01:21:48.486 --> 01:21:50.169
No.

887
01:21:57.596 --> 01:22:00.753
No.
Impossible.


888
01:22:01.607 --> 01:22:03.526
Not by...

889
01:22:04.936 --> 01:22:06.600
you!

890
01:22:40.333 --> 01:22:42.226
You should never met me.

891
01:23:03.153 --> 01:23:05.147
I'm surprised you are here in
person Mr. Beaumont.


892
01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:07.341
The works, completely in order.

893
01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:10.053
I've waited 10 years for this piece.

894
01:23:10.576 --> 01:23:12.138
Hey Mickey, watch it!

895
01:23:12.128 --> 01:23:14.253
Look! What do you think that is?
Coconuts?


896
01:23:14.253 --> 01:23:17.857
That's a... That.
Pre-Islamic stuff you got in there!


897
01:23:18.057 --> 01:23:18.916
Now slowly. Thanks!

898
01:23:19.723 --> 01:23:21.425
Okay! Got it!

899
01:23:40.185 --> 01:23:44.370
Oh yeah. This will make some
very nice engagement gift.


900
01:23:46.235 --> 01:23:49.321
- Very at least a nice engagement gift.
- Yeah.


901
01:23:53.235 --> 01:23:54.211
Hi Nick.

902
01:23:54.211 --> 01:23:56.190
- You're late.
- Sorry.


903
01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:58.069
I'll give you 2000 for them.

904
01:23:59.961 --> 01:24:01.720
So, what are we doing tonight?

905
01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:04.783
"We"?

906
01:24:04.783 --> 01:24:08.423
Ohhh, what's the matter Josh?

907
01:24:08.623 --> 01:24:10.635
Are you afraid of the complications?

908
01:24:11.777 --> 01:24:12.866
You know what?

909
01:24:14.763 --> 01:24:16.341
I think this could help.

910
01:24:17.275 --> 01:24:18.708
Does that help?

911
01:24:25.623 --> 01:24:27.676
Yeah.

912
01:24:28.375 --> 01:24:32.015
Yeah, where uh...
Where are we going tonight?


913
01:24:33.358 --> 01:24:34.827
Dinner and a movie.

914
01:24:35.846 --> 01:24:37.121
With me?

915
01:24:37.321 --> 01:24:38.321
Yeah.

916
01:24:43.548 --> 01:24:45.620
I was thinking more about, um...

917
01:24:46.245 --> 01:24:49.075
...about hotdogs and a ball game.

918
01:24:54.241 --> 01:24:55.948
Yeah.

919
01:24:58.287 --> 01:25:01.645
Um... Are you...
Are you alright?


920
01:25:03.399 --> 01:25:04.855
Alex?
