1
00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:29.087
- You pledged safe passage by wampum belt.

2
00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.632
You pledged safe passage
upon our surrender!


3
00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:32.469
- You...

4
00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:35.597
Old Briton,

5
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:42.019
my brother, pledged devotion to father

6
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:48.150
which he breaks by
traitorous acts with the British!

7
00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:50.401
Ugh!

8
00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:54.196
- Father starves our
people and steals our land

9
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.658
with liquor and trifles.

10
00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.243
He is no father.

11
00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:03.666
And you half breed,

12
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.920
are no true brother of our cause!

13
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.193
- This is not the way of my
people nor the King of France.


14
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.365
- It is the way of the Ottawa,

15
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.828
we'll make our purpose here, like thunder.

16
00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:45.205
- And the two other
traders, Burney and McBryer.


17
00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:46.039
Where be they now?

18
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.167
- The Miami have hid them.

19
00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:52.590
- Well, then I want them
both to Detroit. Unharmed.


20
00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.801
That'll be all, Ensign.

21
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.712
- In the Parlor, Major.

22
00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:23.138
- Madam Fairfax.

23
00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:31.604
- I do not, as I've insisted
on numerous occasions,


24
00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:34.981
reply to Madam or any
other form of mummery


25
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.067
in your presence.

26
00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.491
To you, my dear boy, 
I am simply Sally.

27
00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:48.995
Might that be?
- 'Tis, indeed.


28
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.626
A good fellow in Alexandria did supply it.

29
00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:54.876
- 'Tis French.

30
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.382
- Aye. It's origin, Ma...

31
00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.550
Sally.

32
00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:03.304
- Well, I speak
not a word of French.

33
00:05:05.348 --> 00:05:08.184
- Louis the Beloved, my darling...

34
00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:10.976
George.
- William.


35
00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:13.604
- ...would have the whole
of the Virginia gentry,


36
00:05:13.606 --> 00:05:17.233
whether noble or landed,
croaking out French


37
00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:19.527
if these sensational stories

38
00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.112
of his encroachments and
hostilities in the Ohio Valley


39
00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:24.617
as published in the Gazette, be certified.

40
00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:28.413
- How do you mean, dear nephew?

41
00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.541
- Dear uncle, father. 
How was the hunt?

42
00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:35.418
- That the stories published
in the Gazette be sensational,


43
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.252
how do you mean, sir?

44
00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:37.378
- I believe the boy to mean-

45
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.089
- Let him speak his mind, William.

46
00:05:40.383 --> 00:05:41.259
- I will show you.

47
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.050
"From Bristol.

48
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:48.472
"A one Mrs. Norman found murdered
in her own Huckster shop,


49
00:05:48.474 --> 00:05:50.433
“in a very dismal manner.”

50
00:05:50.435 --> 00:05:54.060
"She, having several marks
of violence about her head,


51
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.938
“a large quantity of blood was issued."

52
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.649
Now the owner of the
Gazette routinely prints


53
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.777
forlorn appeals for old
shirts, caps and handkerchiefs


54
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:03.611
in order to supply

55
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.366
it's paper mill.
- What are you saying, son?


56
00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:10.578
- What I am saying
is that the very estate

57
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.413
of such an enterprise as printed news

58
00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:15.416
demands a measure of sensationalism
for it's very survival


59
00:06:15.418 --> 00:06:18.835
and I'm merely suggesting
that we consider that fact


60
00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:19.878
before England finds itself

61
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.631
in another bloody war with France.

62
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.426
- A fine point, 
George William.

63
00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:26.762
A fine point, indeed.

64
00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.763
- Thank you, sir.

65
00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:30.724
- Young Washington.

66
00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.603
What say you in response
to my nephew's claim


67
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.272
that the stories published in the Gazette

68
00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:40.774
be sensational and uncertified.

69
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:42.068
- 'Twas not a claim, dear uncle.

70
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.070
- The boy was merely suggesting-

71
00:06:44.072 --> 00:06:46.364
- I'm aware, William of
the boy's suggestion,


72
00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:49.494
may also hear what young
Washington would suggest as well.


73
00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:53.204
- I'd say whether sensational or no,

74
00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:56.123
such reports should be
certified without delay,


75
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.167
since it is the
divine right of the Crown

76
00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.213
to the Ohio Valley that is in question.

77
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.886
- You will dine with us tonight, Major.

78
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.056
- It would be an honor, sir.

79
00:07:12.058 --> 00:07:14.183
- Seems the boy has rightly answered.

80
00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:16.310
- Afterward, I shall write
the letter you requested


81
00:07:16.312 --> 00:07:19.979
to Governor Dinwiddie
recommending your commission


82
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.149
to carry the Crown's remonstrance

83
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:24.901
to the French Commandant at Fort Duquesne

84
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:28.405
demanding immediate
cessation of all hostilities


85
00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:30.243
and encroachments in the Ohio Valley.

86
00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:33.327
- Thank you, sir.

87
00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:34.163
Thank you.

88
00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:37.956
- Now, what have you?

89
00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:38.873
- Le Royale, sir.

90
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.252
'Tis to be the first dance
at the Governor's Ball


91
00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:42.088
of the new year.

92
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.050
- Ah, a French Minuet. Wonderful.

93
00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:50.136
You must learn it, at once.

94
00:07:50.138 --> 00:07:55.057
- I can't simply just instruct

95
00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:57.642
without mastery of the language.

96
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:02.649
- Mm. My nephew was taught
parle Francais at Appleby.


97
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:04.858
They are still teaching it at the school,

98
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.111
are they not?
- They are.


99
00:08:07.113 --> 00:08:08.486
- Very well, then,

100
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.072
William shall translate

101
00:08:10.074 --> 00:08:12.992
and Abraham will offer a lively beat.

102
00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:13.995
- Excellent.

103
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.375
- Well, then, there it is.

104
00:08:21.877 --> 00:08:24.502
- No one has journeyed
beyond Logstown with reports,


105
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.337
sensational or no,

106
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.755
of French and Savage
butchery at Pickawillany.


107
00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.217
And you would send a mere
boy into the midst of it.


108
00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.262
- Not I, William, Governor
Dinwiddie shall send the laddie


109
00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:34.471
on behalf of His Majesty.

110
00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:36.931
- Oh, shall he do so as
the Governor of Virginia


111
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.559
or as stockholder in the Ohio Company?

112
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.353
- Be it of any consequence, dear cousin,

113
00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:43.438
if the French be
successful in their efforts


114
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.273
to drive the English
from these Tidewaters?


115
00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:46.068
- Be it of any consequence...

116
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.031
if the boy dies in the wilderness?

117
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.956
- 'Tis mesure trois quarts.

118
00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.541
It's a three quarters
measure in a zed figure


119
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.336
and you may circle more than once

120
00:09:05.338 --> 00:09:06.378
while presenting hands.

121
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.257
Now, remember, George, that the
graceful motion of the arms,


122
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:11.466
and the giving of the hand,

123
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.386
and all material parts
of a gentleman's dancing


124
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:17.682
of the utmost importance,
a man of fashion.


125
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.020
Now, let us begin.

126
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:23.229
What you'll be doing,

127
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:25.272
is you’ll be waiting for the count down

128
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:26.606
and then you'll be coming together.

129
00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:30.238
- I have had some
instruction in the Minuet.


130
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.240
- Right.

131
00:09:34.325 --> 00:09:35.117
Abraham.

132
00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:44.184
- Good morn', Major Washington.

133
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:45.021
- Good morn'.

134
00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:49.857
'Tis there be the letter of
Lordship to Governor Dinwiddie?


135
00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:50.692
- 'Tis.

136
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.777
His Lordship spotted
the red fox this morn',


137
00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.906
he be on the chase with the colonel.

138
00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:01.328
- And, what of Miss...
- Sally?


139
00:11:03.164 --> 00:11:05.122
Asleepin', I expect.

140
00:11:05.124 --> 00:11:07.875
- Aye. 'Tis early.

141
00:11:07.877 --> 00:11:09.292
- It is.

142
00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.336
His Lordship said you are to insist

143
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.088
that the Governor send you with a letter

144
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.133
addressing Mister Christopher Gist

145
00:11:16.135 --> 00:11:19.011
of Will's Creek orderin'
him to accompany you


146
00:11:19.013 --> 00:11:19.845
on the journey.

147
00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:22.472
Mr. Gist is from the Ohio Company.

148
00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:26.434
He has surveyed the winter
lands beyond Logstown.


149
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.769
- I shall so inform the Governor

150
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:30.313
but I need only a translator.

151
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.818
- His Lordship is head
bullied on the matter.


152
00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:37.071
Mr. Gist is accompanying you.

153
00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:38.696
- Very well, then.

154
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.657
- Your mother, sir.

155
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.784
- What about my mother?

156
00:11:41.786 --> 00:11:44.619
- His Lordship will have
you attend to your mother


157
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:49.499
at Ferry Farm with
mindful and warm goodbyes


158
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.670
before proceeding on.

159
00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.547
- Be that the speech of Lord Fairfax,

160
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.634
or that of yours, Abraham?

161
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:01.222
- You buried a brother, sir.

162
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.809
But she buried a son.

163
00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:10.522
Say your goodbyes, Major.

164
00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.728
- Gabriel, I want
those stacks in the wagon.


165
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.815
Rows straight.

166
00:12:57.027 --> 00:13:01.115
See if you can put the
corn in the cabbage patch.


167
00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:16.586
- Now, what is this conceit?

168
00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:17.422
- 'Tis yonder.

169
00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:24.218
- Well, well, this is most curious.

170
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.180
A word has been inscribed
in our cabbage patch.


171
00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.017
- Aye.

172
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:31.311
- And that word is...

173
00:13:32.772 --> 00:13:34.899
- George.
- Aye, George.


174
00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:38.901
But how has this occurred?

175
00:13:38.903 --> 00:13:42.403
Why has the earth written
the name of my son?


176
00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.033
This must be the work of chance.

177
00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:48.118
- I never saw little
plants grow up so as

178
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.411
to make one single letter.

179
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.621
How then could they grow

180
00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:54.415
to make the whole
of my name so exactly.

181
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.834
- Indeed.

182
00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:57.420
This was not done by chance,

183
00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:00.588
by my own hand.

184
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.884
- For what purpose?

185
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.217
- Do you see the
world in which your name

186
00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.928
has now sprung forth?

187
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.389
The sky, blue and boundless.

188
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.809
The river, bubbling up
as it rushes forward.


189
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:13.936
The birds of the air,

190
00:14:13.938 --> 00:14:15.687
and all living things.

191
00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.356
It's amazing. Don't you think, George?

192
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.901
Some would have you to believe today

193
00:14:20.903 --> 00:14:24.445
that all of this
is the work of chance

194
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.281
and not that of Divine Providence,

195
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.786
a loving creator who has
promised never to leave


196
00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:32.411
nor forsake us,

197
00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:37.044
who will forever be by your
side as I am today, George.


198
00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:39.504
Do you understand?

199
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.215
I must be back to work.

200
00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:45.258
Day’s end draws near.

201
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.595
- And work remains.

202
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.471
- Yes, work remains.

203
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.770
Yet, I do so enjoy this wonderful view.

204
00:14:57.565 --> 00:14:59.105
Shall I tarry longer?

205
00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:00.481
- Aye.

206
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.315
- Then I shall.

207
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.529
And I shall give you my time piece

208
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.659
so that I may not
be vexed by its ticking.

209
00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:36.142
- You have been commissioned
by the Governor of Virginia.


210
00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:37.518
- I read your letter.

211
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.812
- Who was acting
by order of the Crown

212
00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:40.315
of whom ye be a subject.

213
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.484
- My son lies sick at the
mouth of the Conegocheague,


214
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.529
'tis him I shall attend.

215
00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:51.575
Be it so I fall not out
of favor with the Crown,


216
00:15:51.577 --> 00:15:54.160
I pray ye relieve me of this undertaking

217
00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.039
so I may go to
my own with no thought.

218
00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.042
- I shall not relieve you.

219
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.840
Go and risk the consequence of it.

220
00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.012
- My wife will provide stew meat,

221
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.515
a place for you to rest
before you set out.


222
00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:16.769
Have a good evening, sir.

223
00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:29.280
- [Washington] Ma'am.

224
00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.366
- Come inside, girls.

225
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:57.685
- Thank you.

226
00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:21.667
- Ye eat like a boy.

227
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.922
- I shall tell Governor
Dinwiddie the circumstances


228
00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.174
surrounding your
husband's insubordination.


229
00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.468
Rest assured he will justly weigh-

230
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.096
- Justly weigh?

231
00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:38.391
- [Washington] Aye.

232
00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.520
- Ye know not the man.

233
00:17:45.816 --> 00:17:46.650
- Pray pardon?

234
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.900
- The governor possesses no ableness

235
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.820
to justly weigh a matter

236
00:17:51.822 --> 00:17:53.780
when his own enrichment be in question.

237
00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.658
- 'Tis the divine right
of the Crown in question,


238
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.702
Misses Gist.

239
00:17:58.704 --> 00:18:02.039
- Ye know not the Crown
as well, Major Washington.


240
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.209
Nor your own self, I suspect.

241
00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:12.549
- What say you, Madam?

242
00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:16.304
- Ye eat and
ye think like a boy.

243
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.894
- Is this the proper
time for this discussion?


244
00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:27.522
- I'm afraid the children
posses more discernment


245
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:28.776
than you, Mr. Washington.

246
00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.697
- I am a commissioned officer
and the King's emissary.


247
00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:37.909
- Ye are inexperienced in
the ways of government.


248
00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.326
And Dinwiddie is a brutish wretch

249
00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.121
to send you on this death trip...

250
00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:51.340
with my husband.

251
00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.515
I'll make ready your room.

252
00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:11.025
- You're quite tall for
a boy, Mr. Washington.


253
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.571
- Beth, it's Major Washington.

254
00:19:15.614 --> 00:19:18.157
- And ye are both quite
smart for such young girls.


255
00:19:27.626 --> 00:19:30.502
- "31st of October, 1753.

256
00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:32.253
"I was commissioned by
the Governor of Virginia


257
00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:35.384
"to deliver a letter to the
French Forces on the Ohio."


258
00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.491
- Why stand ye there, Chris?

259
00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:05.246
'Tis two days journey
to the Conegocheague.


260
00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:08.292
Why ye stand there?

261
00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:16.966
- I wrote a letter and sent
medicine with a messenger.


262
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.640
- Shall our son face his mortality

263
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.101
in the company of a hired man

264
00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.312
instead of his own father
who seems to choose the Crown


265
00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:31.605
over everything else?

266
00:20:31.607 --> 00:20:34.232
- He shall recover, Sarah.

267
00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.527
Ye shall see him soon.

268
00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:37.737
- What if he doesn't?

269
00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:43.617
What if he die out there all alone

270
00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:46.703
without any care from his family?

271
00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:50.373
- Sarah, I am confident he shall recover.

272
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.376
- Oh, Chris.

273
00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:59.759
Here. Offer your new companion a glass.

274
00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:03.472
Could be his last.

275
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:53.480
- 'Tis safe. She'd be gone to bed.

276
00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:57.856
- [Washington] Aye.

277
00:21:57.858 --> 00:22:00.443
- Can you speak French, Major?

278
00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:01.446
- Nay.

279
00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:07.116
- Aye, 'twas your
brother attended Appleby?


280
00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.412
You were schooled at home.

281
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.292
Says, "We, French, shall not
be departin' the Ohio Valley


282
00:22:15.294 --> 00:22:16.584
"any time soon.

283
00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:19.423
"We have the forts and the
Ottawa Nation to back it up."


284
00:22:20.424 --> 00:22:21.383
What'd ye have?

285
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.634
- The Iroquois.

286
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:27.178
The Iroquois still stand with the Crown.

287
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.014
- Do they now?

288
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.182
- You, yourself, negotiated

289
00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:33.684
the treaty at Logstown and-
- Aye.


290
00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:35.853
I committed the Crown
and the Ohio Company,


291
00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:38.106
as I were instructed to,

292
00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:40.483
to build a fort on the Monongahela

293
00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:41.900
to protect the Indian allies

294
00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:44.448
and for my efforts I was promised land.

295
00:22:46.283 --> 00:22:48.743
Neither of which has King George honored.

296
00:22:52.414 --> 00:22:53.871
The Iroquois may still
stand with the Crown


297
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:57.292
but it by the cause of the
Half King's lust of revenge


298
00:22:57.294 --> 00:22:59.962
for the Ottawa killing
and eating his daddy.


299
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:06.969
- The Plate. Where was it found?

300
00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:09.597
- Pickawillany.

301
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:11.891
Or what be left of it.

302
00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:14.683
Trader, by the name of Burney,

303
00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:16.186
took it up out of the ash,

304
00:23:16.188 --> 00:23:19.105
delivered it to me with
a story that the Ottawa,


305
00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:21.274
under French command, raided the village,

306
00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:23.070
killing men, women and children

307
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:26.822
then doin' the same to the Village Chief.

308
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:29.493
- Memeskia?

309
00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:34.081
- He was a good friend,

310
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:40.212
Memeskia, the Old Briton,
put his trust in the Crown.


311
00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:45.005
Kept assurin' him the Fort would be built

312
00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:47.052
and his people would
be safe in the land.

313
00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:51.429
They butchered him in front
of his wife and children


314
00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:54.474
so that no Provincial nor Indian,

315
00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:57.227
not loyal to French,
would dare venture to go


316
00:23:57.229 --> 00:24:00.482
where you and the
Governor would have us go.


317
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:13.869
- I suggest you get some sleep, Major.

318
00:24:15.455 --> 00:24:16.747
It'll be first light, sir.

319
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.044
- Aye.

320
00:24:26.674 --> 00:24:27.633
Good eve', Mr. Gist.

321
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.856
- Ever fire that musket
at a living being, upright,


322
00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:45.609
not scuttling in the dust, Major?

323
00:24:47.237 --> 00:24:48.777
- Nay, Mr. Gist,

324
00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:51.281
was my brother who taught me to fire.

325
00:24:51.283 --> 00:24:52.948
And he also taught
me to stay my hand

326
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.201
in the absence of reason and authority.

327
00:24:55.203 --> 00:24:56.535
- Hm.

328
00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:58.912
Well your brother be not here, Major,

329
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:00.831
be just the two of us.

330
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:03.876
And I know from having trekked through it,

331
00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:06.339
there'd be an absence of
reason where we be heading.


332
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:25.772
- [Washington] “The cold
increased very fast


333
00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:28.567
“and the roads we're becoming
worse by a deep snow.


334
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:31.906
“Therefore, we determined to
continue our journey on foot.”


335
00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:23.081
More provision, sir.

336
00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:24.040
You may take a rest

337
00:26:24.042 --> 00:26:26.708
when you finish with your stories, Major.

338
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:27.711
I'll keep watch.

339
00:26:31.174 --> 00:26:33.717
- What do you think
about eternity, Mr. Gist?


340
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:39.097
- Well, Major, currently
I'm in the employee


341
00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:41.725
of avoiding eternity from the both of us.

342
00:26:44.938 --> 00:26:47.857
As long as I see those
who are mine that I love.


343
00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:50.734
That should be enough.

344
00:26:52.862 --> 00:26:56.572
- Do you fear
the Allegheny more, or Sarah?

345
00:26:56.574 --> 00:26:57.408
- Oh.

346
00:26:58.868 --> 00:27:02.120
Well, if we make it not
across the Allegheny,


347
00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:05.873
her anger will follow me
into your eternity, sir,


348
00:27:05.875 --> 00:27:06.835
that I promise you.

349
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.047
- [Washington] “We met
up with the Half King

350
00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:16.009
“and his men at Logstown
and made an alliance.


351
00:27:16.011 --> 00:27:17.095
“They joined our group.

352
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:22.890
“We all arrived at Fort LeBeouf, 
December 12th, 1753.

353
00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:24.433
“While we awaited to visit the Commandant

354
00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:26.643
“about the letter from Governor Dinwiddie,

355
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:29.521
“I had the opportunity to make
observations about the Fort.


356
00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:30.772
“According to my best judgment,

357
00:27:30.774 --> 00:27:33.567
“there are approximately 100 soldiers.

358
00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:35.736
“The bastions are made of
piles driven into the ground


359
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:38.033
“and about 12 feet above,
and sharp at the top.”


360
00:28:21.993 --> 00:28:23.953
- I've assessed the Fort and made note.

361
00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:28.041
There are about 100 men on...

362
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.966
What say you, Mr. Gist?

363
00:28:38.968 --> 00:28:41.718
- Half King is inside
with Captain La Force.


364
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.890
We cannot put our hopes in these Iroquois.

365
00:28:44.974 --> 00:28:45.890
They've been good to us,

366
00:28:45.892 --> 00:28:48.812
but they can be swayed by what
is best for their survival.


367
00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:52.816
- My hope is not in any man,
Mr. Gist, but in the Divine.


368
00:28:54.525 --> 00:28:57.110
And I pray that
the Half Kings not succumb

369
00:28:57.112 --> 00:28:58.986
to their flattery nor their fine speech,

370
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:01.571
but he assured me that we
ought not be concerned,


371
00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:03.409
that he knew the French all too well.

372
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.493
- They have managed to keep us here

373
00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:08.123
far longer than we ought, Major.

374
00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:11.708
We cannot predict what these Indians

375
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.419
will or will not bow to.

376
00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:23.805
Must stay sharp.

377
00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:45.325
- I believe we are being
invited to sup, Major.


378
00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:47.244
- Very well.

379
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:59.105
- May I ask when Commandant
Legardeur will arrive?


380
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:02.361
- The Commandant has other
demanding priorities, Major.


381
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.659
Ye' do not think that
you are the only one

382
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:11.955
who vies for his attention?

383
00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:20.880
But, I am certain that
he will be back soon.


384
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:23.129
- I should think the highest priority

385
00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:25.509
should be placed on French
and British relations.


386
00:31:27.553 --> 00:31:30.682
- Are you not enjoying
our hospitality, Major?


387
00:31:31.683 --> 00:31:35.185
Here, have some more of
our finest French wine.


388
00:31:54.664 --> 00:31:58.123
- We are obliged by your hospitality.

389
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:01.295
But we are eager to see the
Commandant so we may be on way.


390
00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:06.214
- You know, your Indian companions,

391
00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:07.719
they love our fine wine,

392
00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:12.429
as well as our exquisite gifts.

393
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:13.556
- Aye.

394
00:32:13.558 --> 00:32:14.892
I'm quite certain, they do.

395
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.863
- By whose authority and instruction

396
00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:30.405
do the French Commander
-General

397
00:32:30.407 --> 00:32:33.368
march his troops from Canada
and invade Virginia territory?


398
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.162
- Ye dare ask me this,

399
00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:40.919
when your English subjects
are on French territory.


400
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.003
- They are only there to trade, Captain.

401
00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:45.838
- No.

402
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.422
No Englishman has the right to trade

403
00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:49.134
on French claimed lands.

404
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:51.554
- He speaks in English now.

405
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:56.306
- The British have made
claim to this land.


406
00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:59.017
And I demand a response to
Governor Dinwiddie's letter.


407
00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:00.770
- You are in no position to demand

408
00:33:00.772 --> 00:33:03.021
anything, Major Washington!

409
00:33:03.023 --> 00:33:05.735
- Gentlemen, please,

410
00:33:07.027 --> 00:33:11.406
we are only here to deliver
a message, not start a war.


411
00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:13.200
Major.

412
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:20.500
- Major Washington, did
you not know that La Sol


413
00:33:22.877 --> 00:33:27.882
made the discovery of
this land 60 years ago,


414
00:33:28.966 --> 00:33:33.471
long before English
eyes were even upon it?


415
00:33:39.644 --> 00:33:40.851
- What did they say, Mr. Gist?

416
00:33:40.853 --> 00:33:42.352
- I am not certain,

417
00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:43.353
but I would venture to say

418
00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:46.147
they are not applauding our charm and wit.

419
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:48.486
Major, hold your anger.

420
00:33:52.657 --> 00:33:56.492
- I have never laid eyes on
such a fruitless endeavor.


421
00:33:56.494 --> 00:33:58.034
I shall take my leave, gentlemen.

422
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:01.206
- No, Major, you shall
wait for the Commandant.


423
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:04.460
- We have waited far too long.

424
00:34:07.254 --> 00:34:10.425
- Gentleman, forgive my tardiness.

425
00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:12.883
I have much business to conduct

426
00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:14.762
in continuing the affairs of the Fort.

427
00:34:21.853 --> 00:34:22.978
- Good eve, Commandant.

428
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.022
- Sir, we are
glad you could join us.

429
00:34:27.817 --> 00:34:30.150
- We also have
much business to attend to,

430
00:34:30.152 --> 00:34:31.694
which brings us to the
letter of remonstrance


431
00:34:31.696 --> 00:34:32.904
from Governor Dinwiddie.

432
00:34:34.114 --> 00:34:35.323
Have you a reply for us?

433
00:34:37.702 --> 00:34:39.410
- It must have been a treacherous journey

434
00:34:39.412 --> 00:34:42.621
to come here in the dead of winter.

435
00:34:42.623 --> 00:34:44.164
- Aye.

436
00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:46.751
And I fear it will be
much worse going back.


437
00:34:46.753 --> 00:34:50.798
- Commandant, we have been
here long enough, please.


438
00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:53.923
- I have reviewed the letter

439
00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.884
and I find it to be quite bold,

440
00:34:55.886 --> 00:34:59.056
considering the French have
already claimed this land.


441
00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:05.226
Major Washington, it
is our absolute design


442
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:07.690
to take possession of the Ohio Valley.

443
00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:12.737
Adieu.

444
00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:23.829
- [Washington] “I tied
myself up in a match coat


445
00:35:23.831 --> 00:35:26.373
“and with my pack containing
the letter of remonstrance,


446
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:27.999
“provisions and a gun,

447
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:29.337
“set out with Mr. Gist,

448
00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:32.507
“accompanied by an Indian guide.”

449
00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:00.426
- The guide hastens.

450
00:37:00.428 --> 00:37:02.344
- Do you see him, Major? 
Is he before us?

451
00:37:02.346 --> 00:37:03.178
- Nay, he has quickened.

452
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.555
Are we nigh?

453
00:37:04.557 --> 00:37:05.389
- Two whoops.

454
00:37:05.391 --> 00:37:06.764
He made a claim of two whoops.

455
00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:07.725
You be watchful, Major,

456
00:37:07.727 --> 00:37:09.270
I trust him not.

457
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.762
- Are there others?
- We're in Ottawa nation.


458
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.808
- We have no
writ of execution, Mr. Gist.

459
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.186
We shall return to Williamsburg

460
00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:54.229
to put the Indian to custody.

461
00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:56.940
- Nay, this savage will not take breath

462
00:37:56.942 --> 00:37:58.233
a moment longer, Major.

463
00:37:58.235 --> 00:37:59.235
Stand aside.

464
00:37:59.237 --> 00:38:00.402
- You will put away your
sidearm at once sir,


465
00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:02.240
or you will answer for mutinous acts.

466
00:38:06.369 --> 00:38:07.284
Mr. Gist!
- Ah!


467
00:38:07.286 --> 00:38:10.036
This fell beast is a sweet French monger.

468
00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:11.205
- Halt, I said!

469
00:38:11.207 --> 00:38:13.499
- I now recall you ferreting
about Fort Le Boeuf.


470
00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:14.751
- Halt at once, Mr. Gist.

471
00:38:18.422 --> 00:38:20.088
- He led us into Ottawa territory

472
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.260
to have us murdered by his butchering lot.

473
00:38:24.303 --> 00:38:26.428
They would have your
precious governor's letter


474
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:30.056
and our pitiful scalps if
he had not lost the trail


475
00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:31.225
in this mist.

476
00:38:31.227 --> 00:38:33.851
Two whoops to the cabin, you say...

477
00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:36.397
And I suppose you got
lost and fired your weapon


478
00:38:36.399 --> 00:38:37.358
without thought.

479
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:41.778
We have neither the resource nor fortitude

480
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:44.698
to take custody of this savage.

481
00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:49.159
And since you will
not let me kill him,

482
00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:51.287
we must get him
away and travel all night

483
00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:55.167
to the Allegheny River and
hope it is froze hard to cross.


484
00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:01.965
- Be gone, treacherous fox.

485
00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:10.638
- We are not only emissaries
of the Crown here, Mr. Gist,


486
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.932
but ambassadors of the Divine.

487
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.144
Our every step will speak
beyond this snowy hill.


488
00:39:15.146 --> 00:39:17.271
- That Indian will find his brothers

489
00:39:17.273 --> 00:39:18.648
and they will hunt us down.

490
00:39:21.277 --> 00:39:24.488
Our every step on this
snowy hill will betray us.


491
00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:27.866
We must hurry now.

492
00:39:52.099 --> 00:39:53.850
- Water, Major.
- Good.


493
00:40:24.298 --> 00:40:25.799
Ah, let's not tarry long.

494
00:40:36.435 --> 00:40:38.479
- Shall I make note of
the guide's treason?


495
00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:44.859
I shall make note.

496
00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:01.916
Are they Ottawa, Gist?

497
00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:02.752
- Aye.

498
00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:17.765
-Tis’t the guide and his brothers.

499
00:41:17.767 --> 00:41:18.643
- [Mr. Gist] Aye.

500
00:41:21.981 --> 00:41:24.689
We are in the midst of scalpers.

501
00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:27.067
If it come to a fight,
you take the lead man,


502
00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:29.361
I'll occupy the next two while you reload.

503
00:41:29.363 --> 00:41:30.197
And Major,

504
00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:32.532
show no fear.

505
00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:03.187
- I hear tell ye be quite
the ballroom dancer, Major.


506
00:42:03.189 --> 00:42:04.938
- Why parley such vanity where
there be scalping knives?


507
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.608
- It's a dance, son.

508
00:42:09.903 --> 00:42:10.735
Await the bow,

509
00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:14.657
before ye curtsey the both
of us off to a diet of worms.


510
00:42:56.866 --> 00:42:59.659
- My heart, Mr. Gist.
- No.


511
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:02.664
No, Major, my heart.

512
00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:06.001
I've not-
- No.


513
00:43:10.923 --> 00:43:12.174
- The Allegheny?
- Aye.


514
00:43:13.884 --> 00:43:16.887
And from the sound of her,
she'll be forbiddin' us to cross.


515
00:43:19.181 --> 00:43:20.682
- We shall see.

516
00:43:27.814 --> 00:43:29.732
- Ugh. My heart, Major.

517
00:43:58.053 --> 00:44:00.137
We'll not cross without a vessel.

518
00:44:00.139 --> 00:44:01.263
So I propose we return to Logstown

519
00:44:01.265 --> 00:44:03.934
and make quarters till the
river bids us to cross.


520
00:44:05.351 --> 00:44:06.767
- Nay.

521
00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:09.395
- 'Tis a full day's journey,
must make haste, Major.


522
00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:10.732
- I said, nay, Mr. Gist.

523
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.192
We have confirmed, sir,

524
00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:16.987
that French have assembled
an Army and a war fleet


525
00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:20.993
near Fort La Jonquière and
that they intend to invade.


526
00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:26.331
Virginia is not prepared
for war with France.


527
00:44:28.834 --> 00:44:32.044
Legardeur's reply to Governor
Dinwiddie's remonstrance


528
00:44:32.046 --> 00:44:34.712
is expressly needed to
secure military funding


529
00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:38.301
from the Congress and the
full assurance of the Crown.


530
00:44:39.887 --> 00:44:40.929
We shall cross,

531
00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:45.017
and without delay.

532
00:44:52.149 --> 00:44:53.984
What else, sir, might you propose?

533
00:45:32.022 --> 00:45:33.479
- Two quant poles, Major.

534
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:36.609
Fifteen feet, hollow to float.

535
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.822
Use the Gunter chain to measure it out.

536
00:45:40.823 --> 00:45:42.323
Ten feet, we'll be rudderless.

537
00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:46.036
- Aye.

538
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.121
- Major.

539
00:45:49.123 --> 00:45:49.957
- Aye?

540
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.667
- Where be the Crown, now?

541
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:56.086
- I know not your meaning.

542
00:45:56.088 --> 00:45:59.590
- Your high speech about
the Crown and the Divine.


543
00:46:00.801 --> 00:46:02.260
I see no crown here.

544
00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:05.471
Nothing divine about that river.

545
00:46:07.223 --> 00:46:10.185
Where will we be if you and
I swept off this very night.


546
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.554
- Best I could muster.

547
00:46:47.931 --> 00:46:48.764
- I'll punt and rudder.

548
00:46:48.766 --> 00:46:50.142
You keep us clear of ice.

549
00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:53.979
It'll be coming fast and
as big as a saltbox house.


550
00:46:54.938 --> 00:46:58.397
And Major, if we lose
this barge in the tide,

551
00:46:58.399 --> 00:46:59.900
it be scant moments 'fore that icy water'll

552
00:46:59.902 --> 00:47:01.651
take your last breath.

553
00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:04.278
So you rescue not, but the far shore

554
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.531
and that with dire haste.

555
00:47:32.726 --> 00:47:33.725
Steady, Major.

556
00:47:33.727 --> 00:47:34.558
- Aye, aye, aye!

557
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.392
There, look sharp Major!

558
00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:36.395
- Left! Left!

559
00:47:40.776 --> 00:47:41.777
- Hold, Major!

560
00:47:44.655 --> 00:47:45.363
- Major!

561
00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:52.161
Major!

562
00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:55.958
Major!

563
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:01.920
Major!

564
00:48:01.922 --> 00:48:03.254
Major, here!

565
00:48:03.256 --> 00:48:04.714
Here! Reach!

566
00:48:04.716 --> 00:48:05.926
Reach, Major!

567
00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:22.691
- Give rest, O' 
Lord, to your servant,

568
00:48:22.693 --> 00:48:26.151
Augustine Washington, with
all the saints in heaven.


569
00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:28.487
Look with pity upon the
sorrows of thy servants


570
00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:31.365
for whom prayers are for

571
00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:33.952
and give them peace through
Jesus Christ, our Lord.


572
00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:35.288
Amen.

573
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:02.313
- You sir, have
a cough of the lungs,

574
00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:04.398
for which I'd recommend a paste of honey,

575
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.276
celery seed and pepper to be
used every morning and evening


576
00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:08.864
till though be whole.
- Patsy!


577
00:49:09.698 --> 00:49:11.740
- And do not go from a
warm fire to a cold bed.


578
00:49:11.742 --> 00:49:13.783
- [Woman] Quit vexing the boy.

579
00:49:13.785 --> 00:49:16.578
- My sister, Elizabeth
perished from such a cough.


580
00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.830
So I'd adhere to
my cure to the letter.

581
00:49:18.832 --> 00:49:20.874
- [Woman] Come here, child.

582
00:49:20.876 --> 00:49:23.250
- And that sir,
is the weight of it.

583
00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:25.252
- Cease your yowling!

584
00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:27.633
You are terrifying
little George Washington.


585
00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:02.959
- Stay awake!

586
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.799
- Legardeur's reply.

587
00:50:10.801 --> 00:50:12.134
Has it survived the river?

588
00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:15.094
- You're not shivering, son.

589
00:50:15.096 --> 00:50:18.932
- Has it survived the river?

590
00:50:18.934 --> 00:50:21.266
- Ye should be
torn up with the shakes,

591
00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:23.772
yet, ye lay there still as a dustman.

592
00:50:26.357 --> 00:50:28.902
And do not sleep. 
You must stay awake.

593
00:50:29.736 --> 00:50:31.276
Your blood is freezing.

594
00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:33.030
If you sleep, you'll not awaken.

595
00:50:37.952 --> 00:50:39.619
- Did Legardeur's reply

596
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:40.831
survive the river?

597
00:50:44.626 --> 00:50:46.418
- Bags were untouched by the river.

598
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.462
It has survived.

599
00:50:52.426 --> 00:50:55.677
- That is good news, Mr. Gist.

600
00:50:55.679 --> 00:50:57.512
Good news, indeed.

601
00:50:57.514 --> 00:50:59.221
- I must gather fuel for the fire

602
00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:02.644
or neither you nor I will
survive this night's cold.


603
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:05.354
Stay awake.

604
00:51:07.106 --> 00:51:07.940
- Aye.

605
00:51:24.416 --> 00:51:25.584
The Minuet.

606
00:51:30.212 --> 00:51:34.049
You inquired of my skill
on the dance floor.


607
00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:36.762
I am quite handy at the Minuet.

608
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:43.560
Best in Virginia some would say.

609
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.439
- Ye be chatterin' now, son. That's good.

610
00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:53.027
- I be frosted, Mr. Gist.

611
00:51:55.781 --> 00:52:00.786
Frosted.

612
00:52:16.802 --> 00:52:18.551
- I've been following Washington's career,

613
00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:20.302
and I believe he's quite the leader.

614
00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:22.555
- You're right, sir.
- Colonel Fairfax,


615
00:52:22.557 --> 00:52:24.766
what say you about this commission?

616
00:52:24.768 --> 00:52:27.393
- George is rather young,
but he's proved himself able.


617
00:52:27.395 --> 00:52:28.896
- Well said, sir.

618
00:52:38.657 --> 00:52:40.615
- Ah, Lord Fairfax.

619
00:52:40.617 --> 00:52:44.619
I just read our young Washington's report

620
00:52:44.621 --> 00:52:49.039
seems to be a trifle of
flourishments in these words,


621
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.625
what say you?

622
00:52:50.627 --> 00:52:52.000
- Young Washington's integrity

623
00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.296
be not the one in question.

624
00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.096
- The bloody flux is a retched disease

625
00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:07.017
making mortality a constant companion.

626
00:53:09.271 --> 00:53:12.815
- His skill surpasses the
most noblest of gentry.


627
00:54:14.544 --> 00:54:15.794
- Shall we dance another?

628
00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:18.213
- Well, it would
be my pleasure, dear sir,

629
00:54:18.215 --> 00:54:22.425
but I'm afraid I hotly vexed your admirers

630
00:54:22.427 --> 00:54:23.967
who would gladly see me dangle

631
00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:26.471
in the sheriff's picture-frame
if we were to step again.


632
00:54:26.473 --> 00:54:29.474
Oh, but do tell me again,
Colonel Washington,


633
00:54:29.476 --> 00:54:32.184
for you have failed to
describe in any embellishment


634
00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:34.479
how you and Christopher Gist were rescued

635
00:54:34.481 --> 00:54:36.980
from that iceberg-besieged river.

636
00:54:36.982 --> 00:54:39.068
- 'Tis all in my journal, Sally.

637
00:54:40.362 --> 00:54:41.402
- Oh.

638
00:54:41.404 --> 00:54:44.071
- I was just discussing
the sensational details


639
00:54:44.073 --> 00:54:45.030
with Dr. Craik here,

640
00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:47.283
of which having been
published, my dearest darling,


641
00:54:47.285 --> 00:54:48.951
in newspapers, both here and abroad,

642
00:54:48.953 --> 00:54:51.078
have made our raw laddie here, the toast

643
00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.455
of these thirteen colonies.

644
00:54:52.457 --> 00:54:55.082
- Oh, well, I've even heard
that the King, himself,


645
00:54:55.084 --> 00:54:57.044
has taken a peek at the venturous tale.

646
00:54:58.213 --> 00:54:59.629
- 'Twas Governor Dinwiddie's enterprise

647
00:54:59.631 --> 00:55:02.256
to make my report public record.

648
00:55:02.258 --> 00:55:03.966
Beyond that, I hid not the ending.

649
00:55:03.968 --> 00:55:06.594
- Nor did you add any flourish
to the extraordinary fact


650
00:55:06.596 --> 00:55:08.221
that the very next morning-

651
00:55:08.223 --> 00:55:10.847
- The Allegheny had, to quote said,

652
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:12.849
"flourish-less report,"

653
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:16.061
“shut up hard with ice” so that
Colonel Washington, here,


654
00:55:16.063 --> 00:55:18.065
and Mr. Gist, simply strolled across it.

655
00:55:19.401 --> 00:55:20.441
- Aye.

656
00:55:20.443 --> 00:55:21.986
That would be the weight of it.

657
00:55:23.446 --> 00:55:27.156
- And, yet, that
isn't quite, as you say,

658
00:55:27.158 --> 00:55:29.658
the "weight of it," is it, Colonel?

659
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.827
- Please, Dear Doctor,

660
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:33.246
has the boy not narrowly escaped

661
00:55:33.248 --> 00:55:35.415
the hostilities of the Ohio Valley

662
00:55:35.417 --> 00:55:38.959
only to be besieged right
here in the Governor's Palace.


663
00:55:38.961 --> 00:55:40.669
- I am quite certain, my dear,

664
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:42.754
after such a narrow escape,

665
00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:44.881
young Washington has
grown quite impenetrable


666
00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:48.635
to words fired by a musket
blast of gentlemanly inquiry.


667
00:55:48.637 --> 00:55:50.223
Pray tell, Doctor, what say you?

668
00:55:51.224 --> 00:55:54.641
- I say that I spoke to Mr.
Christopher Gist earlier today.


669
00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:56.311
I have been treating the poor fellow,

670
00:55:56.313 --> 00:55:58.937
he's been stricken with a
nasty case of frostbite.


671
00:55:58.939 --> 00:56:00.605
And, according to Mr. Gist,

672
00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:03.859
Colonel Washington fancies
the timely occasion


673
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:07.904
of a shut up Allegheny to be
an act of Divine Providence,


674
00:56:07.906 --> 00:56:11.451
as opposed to the simple,
scientific operation


675
00:56:11.453 --> 00:56:13.785
of water at thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit.

676
00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:14.619
- Yes, indeed.

677
00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:18.082
- And how, George, do you
respond to this indictment


678
00:56:18.084 --> 00:56:20.792
that some would say to
be unreasonable reasoning


679
00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:22.919
in the age, of reason, sir?

680
00:56:22.921 --> 00:56:25.881
- With bygone earnest I should expect.

681
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:28.092
- I hold the thought of Divine Providence

682
00:56:28.094 --> 00:56:30.553
quite pleasing, kind sir.

683
00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:32.305
- As do I for this port.

684
00:56:32.307 --> 00:56:34.557
Find it to be quite pleasing indeed.

685
00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:36.353
Albeit a bit tart.

686
00:56:37.187 --> 00:56:41.815
- Well then, there you have it.

687
00:56:44.277 --> 00:56:46.818
- Dr. James Craik, Colonel.

688
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.197
I've been assigned to
serve as chief surgeon


689
00:56:49.199 --> 00:56:51.449
in your Provincial Regiment, sir.

690
00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:52.991
- 'Tis a pleasure,

691
00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:54.951
although I sincerely hope
I will not be in need


692
00:56:54.953 --> 00:56:56.454
of your services, Doctor.

693
00:56:56.456 --> 00:56:57.996
- Aye, Colonel.

694
00:56:57.998 --> 00:57:00.791
- I shall, between musket
fire and war whoops,


695
00:57:00.793 --> 00:57:03.378
look forward to the
continuance of our discourse.


696
00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.132
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have some matters to attend.


697
00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:10.844
- Uh, war whoops, you say?

698
00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:15.972
- Aye, and scalping knives.

699
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:20.562
Good eve, William.

700
00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:42.793
A horse, please.

701
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.476
- I trust not a man endowed
with a flourishment of words,


702
00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:02.644
his deeds tend to fall
short of the monuments


703
00:58:02.646 --> 00:58:04.232
constructed by his vocabulary.

704
00:58:05.191 --> 00:58:07.566
- If that be a compliment, dear lady,

705
00:58:07.568 --> 00:58:10.194
I attribute my lack of
flourish not to any virtue,


706
00:58:10.196 --> 00:58:11.611
but to an inferior education,

707
00:58:11.613 --> 00:58:14.075
which I, daily, labor to improve.

708
00:58:15.243 --> 00:58:17.996
- I assume not your virtue,
nor lack thereof, dear sir.


709
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:24.335
- With whom might I have
the pleasure of speaking?


710
00:58:25.378 --> 00:58:27.213
- I'm the wife of Mr. 
Daniel Custis.

711
00:58:29.966 --> 00:58:31.715
- Of New Kent County?

712
00:58:31.717 --> 00:58:33.136
- Of the Governor's Council.

713
00:58:34.553 --> 00:58:36.845
- My father and your
husband knew of each other.


714
00:58:36.847 --> 00:58:38.763
He is well regarded.

715
00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:40.975
Now, if you will allow me, madam,

716
00:58:40.977 --> 00:58:43.936
it has been a very long evening.

717
00:58:43.938 --> 00:58:45.478
- Many in the House believe your trip

718
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.440
to the French Commandant to be theatrics,

719
00:58:48.442 --> 00:58:49.441
to induce public sentiment,

720
00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:50.903
both here and abroad for war.

721
00:58:52.947 --> 00:58:55.864
- I assure you, the
number of French Regulars


722
00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:58.742
I've appraised be not theater.

723
00:58:58.744 --> 00:59:01.453
- An appraisal based on Captain
Jonquière's licensed tongue


724
00:59:01.455 --> 00:59:04.373
which vanished from restraint
by a liberal dosing of wine,


725
00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:06.666
you count as reliable, sir.

726
00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:07.584
- The fact that I am a gentleman

727
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:10.006
forbids me to answer such a query, madam.

728
00:59:11.174 --> 00:59:12.464
Good eve.

729
00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:13.966
- Do you also ascribe to the notion

730
00:59:13.968 --> 00:59:15.259
that an outpost officer,

731
00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:16.760
clearly lacking a military discipline,

732
00:59:16.762 --> 00:59:19.305
would be privy to the true
nature of the French occupation


733
00:59:19.307 --> 00:59:20.306
in the Ohio Valley,

734
00:59:20.308 --> 00:59:22.141
or that Jonquière's description

735
00:59:22.143 --> 00:59:24.434
of insurmountable French
presence in the Ohio Valley


736
00:59:24.436 --> 00:59:27.397
be not mere bluster to seduce
the Indians in your charge.


737
00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:32.486
- Where madam, do you get your facts?

738
00:59:33.779 --> 00:59:35.445
- 'Tis in your journal, sir.

739
00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:36.821
- 'Tis all in your journal.

740
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:39.658
- Well, sentiment or
no, England is at war.


741
00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:42.619
- Why then, have no British
Regulars landed in Alexandria


742
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:44.247
to enforce the Governor's ultimatum?

743
00:59:44.249 --> 00:59:47.624
- I know not, perhaps a
ship sails this very moment.


744
00:59:47.626 --> 00:59:49.919
- I can assure you no ship sails.

745
00:59:49.921 --> 00:59:52.422
- 'Tis a big blue sea, madam.

746
00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:55.757
- Doubt me not, Colonel.

747
00:59:55.759 --> 00:59:57.301
As well as being the
wife of Daniel Custis,


748
00:59:57.303 --> 00:59:59.844
I am also the granddaughter
of Sir Daniel Parke,


749
00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.305
aide-de-camp to the Duke of Marlborough

750
01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:03.598
and personal advisor to Queen Anne.

751
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.809
I assure you, sir, I
enjoy reliable sources


752
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.187
both here and in England.

753
01:00:08.189 --> 01:00:10.982
No ship travels to our aid, sir.

754
01:00:10.984 --> 01:00:12.818
Virginia is alone in this enterprise.

755
01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.028
- Then why critique my appraisals

756
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.531
in such a disagreeable manner?

757
01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:26.663
What?

758
01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:27.791
No quip, dear lady?

759
01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.461
- You appraise a mere six hundred.

760
01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.131
Are you aware there are reports

761
01:00:35.133 --> 01:00:37.799
of over fifteen hundred
French Regulars landing


762
01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.636
on the southern shores of Lake Eerie?

763
01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.888
That, Colonel, will be
an overwhelming force


764
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.639
to an army of planters and shopkeepers

765
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.226
that you have been promoted to command.

766
01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:49.521
And that, sir, is the weight of it.

767
01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:57.864
- What is your name, madam?

768
01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:01.740
- I have told you that I am
the wife of Daniel Custis.


769
01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:02.994
- You've told me nothing.

770
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:05.702
- I have, most assuredly, warned you

771
01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:08.039
that there will be a force
of more than two-thousand-


772
01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:09.750
- You are that brass, little girl.

773
01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:12.500
A paste of honey, celery seed and pepper

774
01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:15.087
to be used every morning and
evening till thou be whole


775
01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:17.798
and do not go from a warm fire-

776
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.260
- To a cold bed.

777
01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:26.265
How is it that you revive
my memory by a cold remedy?


778
01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:28.477
- Because it is an
effective one, dear lady,


779
01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.231
and because I've thought
of that brass, little girl


780
01:01:33.107 --> 01:01:36.194
many times since my father's death.

781
01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:44.660
You are the daughter of John Dandridge.

782
01:01:46.245 --> 01:01:47.080
And your name is-

783
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.373
- Martha.

784
01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:52.667
My name is Martha.

785
01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:05.507
- [Washington] “I've gotten
word that the French


786
01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:08.969
“were at the crossing of
Youghiogheny about 18 miles away.


787
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.471
“I hurried to this place
as a convenient spot.


788
01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:14.307
“We have with natures assistance
made a good entrenchment


789
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:16.142
“and by clearing the bushes
out of these meadows


790
01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:18.561
“prepared a charming
field for an encounter.


791
01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.272
“I dispatched men to discover
the enemy and their strength.


792
01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.901
“I must take the liberty of
mentioning to Your Honor


793
01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:26.402
“the necessity there is
for having goods out here


794
01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:29.031
“to give for services of the Indians.

795
01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:31.951
“They all expect it and refuse to scout

796
01:04:31.953 --> 01:04:33.286
“or do any thing without it.

797
01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:36.872
“These services are paid
well by the French.


798
01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:39.290
“I really think with
five or six hundred pounds

799
01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.542
“worth of proper goods sent,

800
01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:43.003
“it would be in our best interest.”

801
01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:44.212
- You're cloak, sir.

802
01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.798
Clean as a whistle.

803
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.385
- Thank you, Ensign Gates.
- Sir.


804
01:04:51.973 --> 01:04:53.388
- [Washington] “I have
been obliged to pay shirts


805
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.057
“for what they have already done,

806
01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:56.560
“which I cannot continue to do.”

807
01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:08.528
- I know ye must have seen
enough fire for one day


808
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:13.535
and fear the flames.

809
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.370
I read a once story about three men

810
01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.207
who were thrown into a fire.

811
01:05:20.835 --> 01:05:24.377
As they looked on, a fourth
walked in to protect them.


812
01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:28.843
A Divine presence saving
them from the flames...


813
01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:32.555
But where be He now?

814
01:05:34.557 --> 01:05:38.686
We are just man against undivine man,

815
01:05:39.562 --> 01:05:42.439
until we all be consumed
and burned in the flames.


816
01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.483
You take first watch.

817
01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:48.486
We ride out at dawn.

818
01:06:07.506 --> 01:06:08.338
- Pa, it's me.

819
01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.717
- That is a good
way to get hurt, boy.

820
01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.718
- The French.

821
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.720
They raided and burnt
the cabin this morning


822
01:06:14.722 --> 01:06:15.554
looking for you.

823
01:06:15.556 --> 01:06:17.681
Ma and the girls are unhurt.

824
01:06:17.683 --> 01:06:20.561
They fled to Logstown
and will meet us there.


825
01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:33.196
- Take this.

826
01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.573
Go into those trees.

827
01:06:34.575 --> 01:06:35.534
Don't make a sound.

828
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.150
- You don't strike me as
someone who plays with dolls.


829
01:07:14.824 --> 01:07:16.448
- Are you Mr. Christopher Gist?

830
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.743
- Who be askin'?

831
01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.792
- I am Ensign Drouillon,
of the French Regulars


832
01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:28.711
stationed at Fort Duquesne.

833
01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:31.547
My superior here, 
Captain Jumonville,

834
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:34.132
has received word that ye may
be working with the British


835
01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:34.968
as a spy.

836
01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.302
- I have no quarrel with the French,

837
01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.348
nor does my loyalty lie with the British.

838
01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.349
I am but a simple farmer.

839
01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:46.352
- What right do ye have to
defy the French authorities?


840
01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:49.063
- I have no intention of
defying French authority,


841
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:52.108
but I am certain I have every
right to defend my family.


842
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:55.278
- Do ye expect to defeat
our entire regiment alone?


843
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.156
- Your ole friend, Half-King
and fifty of his warriors


844
01:07:58.158 --> 01:07:58.992
lie in wait.

845
01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:03.789
Are you certain you
want to do this today?

846
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:26.102
- We will be watching you, Mr. Gist.

847
01:08:37.573 --> 01:08:38.407
- Son.

848
01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.034
I must warn Washington.

849
01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:45.328
Tell your mother to meet
me at the great crossing.


850
01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:46.247
Go. Quickly.

851
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.545
- I asked for seventy-four
wagons at Winchester.


852
01:08:53.547 --> 01:08:55.256
Why have ye arrived with only one?

853
01:08:56.342 --> 01:08:59.050
- Indeed, we been sent
from Winchester, sir,


854
01:08:59.052 --> 01:09:02.387
but I don't know about
the seventy-four wagons.


855
01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:04.933
But I do know we have
another one arriving soon.


856
01:09:06.226 --> 01:09:07.183
- Arriving soon?

857
01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:08.935
- Yes, sir.

858
01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:12.980
- What are you doing
driving military supplies?


859
01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.316
Who sent you?

860
01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:16.901
- Captain Van Braam,
please help your nephew


861
01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:17.738
unload the wagon.

862
01:09:20.741 --> 01:09:23.282
- Captain Broadwater sent us, sir.

863
01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:26.953
I've always wanted a
chance to be in the army.


864
01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:28.497
At least drivin' these here wagons,

865
01:09:28.499 --> 01:09:31.500
I gets to do my part...

866
01:09:31.502 --> 01:09:33.502
I'm sorry, but I'm
just doing as I'm told

867
01:09:33.504 --> 01:09:36.423
and ye have these two wagons,

868
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:40.218
compliments of Captain Broadwater, sir.

869
01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.137
- I suppose we'll
have to make do then.

870
01:09:44.139 --> 01:09:44.971
- [Driver] Yes, sir.

871
01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:45.932
- What is your name, driver?

872
01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:48.143
- Samuel Jenkins, sir.

873
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.728
- Ensign Bland.
- Sir?


874
01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:53.813
- See to it that Mister
Jenkins and his horses


875
01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:54.731
are refreshed.

876
01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:55.651
- [Bland] Aye, sir.

877
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.279
- [Jenkins] Thank you, sir.

878
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.197
- Let me help.

879
01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:06.993
Carry on, Jenkins.

880
01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.455
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

881
01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:16.297
- Colonel.
- Report, Major.


882
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:21.258
- Provisions from Winchester
have been inadequate, at best.


883
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.510
Dr. Craik removed four more men from duty,

884
01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:25.512
stricken with the bloody fluxes.

885
01:10:25.514 --> 01:10:26.599
- That'd be five, sir.

886
01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.977
- Find out the
cause of this, Dr. Craik.

887
01:10:34.523 --> 01:10:37.066
- The cause be these filthy condition.

888
01:10:38.694 --> 01:10:40.985
Clean up your bloody tent, lad.

889
01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.071
- Is that all, Major?

890
01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:46.949
- Last night, the scouts
examined movement in the wild.


891
01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:47.911
Our sentries fired.

892
01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.786
The men stayed on arms till dawn,

893
01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:52.707
but we found no enemy.

894
01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.334
- Was roll called this morn'?

895
01:10:55.336 --> 01:10:56.169
- Aye.

896
01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.255
Six men are missing.

897
01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:02.301
Shall I dispatch a company?

898
01:11:03.219 --> 01:11:04.218
- Nay.

899
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.886
We've sent twenty-three men
out after deserters already.


900
01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.223
Record the names, and send
them to Governor Dinwiddie.


901
01:11:09.225 --> 01:11:12.060
Now, Major Stobo, is that all?

902
01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:15.648
- Christopher Gist has
arrived from Wills Creek, sir.


903
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.611
- Thank you, Major.

904
01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:26.906
Good day, Mr. Gist!

905
01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:28.783
- Colonel now, is it?

906
01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:29.620
- Aye.

907
01:11:31.497 --> 01:11:34.164
- Did I overhear Captain
Van Braam murmuring


908
01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:35.417
about a lack of supplies?

909
01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:39.961
- Indeed, we are nearing
the end of our provisions.


910
01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.881
- How be the lowlander these days?

911
01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.509
- He is still,

912
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:47.179
what did you call him, Mr. Gist?

913
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:49.929
- Bit of a high class dandy.

914
01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:52.351
But, I do not hold that against him.

915
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:55.017
- He is proficient at the sword,

916
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.936
having been my instructor at Mount Vernon

917
01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:57.812
and a decent translator.

918
01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.314
- [Mr. Gist] 
I trust not his French.

919
01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:02.692
- Nor his English, if truth be told.

920
01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:05.653
- Nonetheless, he is the
only translator we have so,


921
01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:08.030
therefore we shall make
do with his French.


922
01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:09.491
Have ye eaten?

923
01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:13.746
- Hardtack, Mr. Gist. 
Soaked in rum.

924
01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:17.873
A delicacy of the Virginia Militia.

925
01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.959
- Aye. Thank you, Doctor.

926
01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:22.295
I've heard many tales
about the fine dining


927
01:12:22.297 --> 01:12:24.674
of a military campaign.

928
01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:27.885
- Certainly no match for your wife's stew.

929
01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:32.765
- Deer jerk.

930
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.020
I trust ye will find it
better than the hardtack.


931
01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:42.484
Well, then, Mr. Gist,

932
01:12:44.278 --> 01:12:47.156
what brings you to our charming field?

933
01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.783
- I was paid
a visit by the French.

934
01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.371
- The French?
- Aye.


935
01:12:55.456 --> 01:12:58.914
Captain Jumonville and his
regulars from Fort Duquesne.


936
01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.543
It seems the news of
my loyalty to the crown


937
01:13:01.545 --> 01:13:02.628
has become widespread.

938
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.092
They burned my farm for
helpin' you last winter.


939
01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:15.892
- Hard news.
- Aye.


940
01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:20.230
- They are greedy for
land south of the Ohio.


941
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.357
Do ye believe that vengeance
was his true intent?


942
01:13:24.359 --> 01:13:27.028
- If it was not, 'tis now.

943
01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:30.988
- With the fall of Fort Prince George,

944
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.325
there are now no fortifications
between our position,


945
01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:34.742
and the French.

946
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.702
We must fortify as quickly as possible.

947
01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:38.373
- [Mr. Gist] That is not all, Colonel.

948
01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:40.374
- Go on.

949
01:13:40.376 --> 01:13:42.209
- Ridin' here, 
I came across their tracks.

950
01:13:42.211 --> 01:13:45.297
North-east. Not five
miles from this very tent.


951
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.215
- How many men?

952
01:13:48.217 --> 01:13:50.593
- [Mr. Gist] Thirty, likely more.

953
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:54.970
- The French are either
spying or setting an ambush.


954
01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:56.391
- [Mr. Gist] Aye.

955
01:13:58.726 --> 01:13:59.852
- James,

956
01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.271
alert Captain Stephens
to muster his men,


957
01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:05.107
two days' rations, forty rounds of powder,

958
01:14:05.109 --> 01:14:05.942
and fresh flints.

959
01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:09.946
We shall march to the Half
-King this eve.

960
01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:12.657
- Aye, Colonel.

961
01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.328
- Do not rush to arms, son.

962
01:14:17.162 --> 01:14:19.371
- If ye be right about the tracks

963
01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:20.871
belonging to Jumonville, Mr. Gist,

964
01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.834
we are already late to arms.

965
01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:26.336
The French are to remain in the belief

966
01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:27.797
that our numbers are greater,

967
01:14:29.383 --> 01:14:31.632
until we be reinforced by Colonel Fry

968
01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.011
and his New York Companies.

969
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.603
If I might impose upon
you yet again, my friend.


970
01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:48.609
- I helped you once, now
my family be endangered.


971
01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:51.902
- Ye still be a loyal
subject of the Crown,


972
01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:54.907
and my fellow compatriot.

973
01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:02.330
This circumstance may lead

974
01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.790
to an open conflict with the French.

975
01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:07.171
Governor Dinwiddie must be informed.

976
01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:13.135
For the sake of your family,
if for no other reason.


977
01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.609
- I suppose the French
will not stop at threats.


978
01:15:38.202 --> 01:15:39.036
I'll see to it.

979
01:15:43.414 --> 01:15:44.249
Colonel...

980
01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:48.253
my heart, yet again.

981
01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:51.298
- Mr. Gist.

982
01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:12.361
- What say ye this stormy eve cousin?

983
01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:15.696
- Can ye imagine it,

984
01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.952
a world of little people with one giant.

985
01:16:21.078 --> 01:16:21.912
- Ah...

986
01:16:22.913 --> 01:16:24.122
Gulliver's Travels.

987
01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:29.127
Well, it's not unlike the world today.

988
01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:33.088
When a great office is vacant,

989
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:36.423
five or six candidates
petition the emperor


990
01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.928
to entertain his majesty
with a dance on the rope;


991
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:43.681
and whoever jumps the
highest without falling,


992
01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:45.060
succeeds in the office.

993
01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:48.352
- Can we not enjoy one eve

994
01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.356
without you plotting your next move.

995
01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:53.651
- [Lord Fairfax] I'm just
quoting the book, William.


996
01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.696
I've received word that
our young Washington


997
01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:00.491
is in need of supplies.

998
01:17:04.955 --> 01:17:06.453
- [Lord Fairfax] And...

999
01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:07.958
did you petition the Governor?

1000
01:17:14.881 --> 01:17:17.381
I've long pondered, Thomas,

1001
01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:20.176
if it were your studied
intent to see the boy fail


1002
01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:21.013
in the Ohio.

1003
01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:25.223
Last winter, ye asserted your influence

1004
01:17:25.225 --> 01:17:26.765
to see Governor Dinwiddie,

1005
01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:29.768
send the boy into the wild with
the letter of remonstrance,


1006
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.770
but now ye assert none when he petitions

1007
01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.314
for aid and supplies.

1008
01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:34.151
Why?

1009
01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:39.070
- So entrenched in his noble
ideals, our young Washington.


1010
01:17:39.072 --> 01:17:40.822
'Tis why I did pick the boy, William.

1011
01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:41.992
- Ye picked the boy?

1012
01:17:46.246 --> 01:17:47.705
- Like a ripe apple.

1013
01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:52.125
- For what did ye pick him?

1014
01:17:52.127 --> 01:17:54.627
- Why, for the
task at hand, of course.

1015
01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:57.381
There is not a finer officer
than one who is unafraid


1016
01:17:58.258 --> 01:18:00.052
to fight alongside his men.

1017
01:18:03.055 --> 01:18:04.806
- Ye speak of war, Thomas.

1018
01:18:06.099 --> 01:18:07.433
What plot have ye hatched?

1019
01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:10.601
- At this very hour,

1020
01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.228
whispers are finding
their way into the ears


1021
01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:13.813
of King George of the threat

1022
01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:16.398
the French pose in acquiring
the land in the Ohio Valley


1023
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.733
for the Crown,

1024
01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:19.318
including our five million acres.

1025
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.198
- So you do speak of the Ohio.

1026
01:18:22.824 --> 01:18:25.116
You would rather see our
boys die in bloody war-


1027
01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:26.242
- What did ye think?

1028
01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:29.495
That I was to entrust
the Fairfax Land Grant


1029
01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:31.998
to the inept and bumbling
House of Burgesses,


1030
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.834
who've thrice attempted to deprive me,

1031
01:18:34.836 --> 01:18:39.047
us, you, and your
dear son of our land?

1032
01:18:39.049 --> 01:18:39.881
Our wealth?

1033
01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:40.801
Our future?

1034
01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:46.098
- And what of the fate
of young Washington?


1035
01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:49.433
- Hm.

1036
01:19:05.826 --> 01:19:07.660
- There. Across there.

1037
01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:30.014
- Laddie!
- I'm all right.


1038
01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.184
I'm all right.

1039
01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:15.101
- You should check your pants Captain!

1040
01:20:15.103 --> 01:20:16.644
I can smell it from here.

1041
01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:17.731
It's just an owl.

1042
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.332
- Watch your step, boys.

1043
01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:43.172
Stephens.

1044
01:20:59.064 --> 01:20:59.898
- Here.

1045
01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:05.110
Hostiles, sir?

1046
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.575
- 'Tis the Half
-King, our brother.

1047
01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.577
- I thought he promised us fifty warriors?

1048
01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:16.455
There are but ten.

1049
01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:19.250
- We'll have to make do.

1050
01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:22.209
Come.

1051
01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:24.213
The Half-King will lead us
to the French encampment.


1052
01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:28.217
- All right, men let's go.

1053
01:22:17.559 --> 01:22:19.391
- I count thirty-five.

1054
01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:21.688
- Aye. We be evenly-matched, sir.

1055
01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:24.438
- Colonel.

1056
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.987
These be well-used French Marines,

1057
01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:33.615
and we be farmers, land
lopers, and convicts.


1058
01:22:33.617 --> 01:22:35.700
- And we have
been in rain all night.

1059
01:22:35.702 --> 01:22:38.493
Our powder may be wet, and
Bessie may not be in the mood


1060
01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.495
to pop-off this morn'.

1061
01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:42.041
- My girl hasn't failed me yet.

1062
01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:43.752
We'll be ready.

1063
01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:48.172
- Waggoner, tell Stephens to fix bayonets.

1064
01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:50.297
If our muskets fail,

1065
01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.634
he and his men are to join
us in charging the camp.


1066
01:22:52.636 --> 01:22:53.469
- Aye.

1067
01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.138
- Major Stobo, hold fire
till I give command.


1068
01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:58.975
- Aye.

1069
01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:01.643
Follow me.

1070
01:23:01.645 --> 01:23:03.480
- Captain Van Braam...

1071
01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:06.440
stay by my side.

1072
01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:09.944
I shall have need of your French.

1073
01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:13.113
- Aye, Colonel.

1074
01:23:14.491 --> 01:23:16.116
At your side I shall remain.

1075
01:23:19.829 --> 01:23:21.370
- Bayonets one, or all of us?

1076
01:23:21.372 --> 01:23:22.830
Let's go.

1077
01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:23.667
Bayonets.

1078
01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:30.546
There's no time

1079
01:23:30.548 --> 01:23:31.380
to be fearful.
- Mm-hmm.


1080
01:23:31.382 --> 01:23:34.009
- It's time to be brave.
- Mm-hmm.


1081
01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.269
- La Force.

1082
01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:51.146
- Fire at will! Fire at will!

1083
01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:03.368
- Ah. I told the Colonel
ye wouldn't fail me, lass.


1084
01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:17.840
Now look what ye gone and done!

1085
01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:10.809
- Colonel Washington, sir!

1086
01:27:11.519 --> 01:27:12.437
Colonel Washington.

1087
01:27:15.315 --> 01:27:16.608
Colonel Washington we've got them on the-

1088
01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.668
- So you want to dance?

1089
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:39.464
Ah. Let's hunt.

1090
01:27:51.559 --> 01:27:52.644
Come on, boy!

1091
01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:02.276
- Stephens! Stephens!

1092
01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:03.695
- Stobo! Van Braam!

1093
01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:06.447
- I can manage, Colonel.

1094
01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:07.283
Go on.

1095
01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:09.243
Go on!

1096
01:28:29.555 --> 01:28:34.560
- Charge!

1097
01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:34.619
- I don't understand what you're saying?

1098
01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:36.663
Van Braam!

1099
01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:41.001
Captain Van Braam!

1100
01:29:41.461 --> 01:29:42.503
- I don't understand.

1101
01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:46.923
- Colonel Washington!

1102
01:30:28.799 --> 01:30:30.006
- Easy now.

1103
01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:30.842
Easy.

1104
01:30:33.346 --> 01:30:35.262
Here we go.

1105
01:30:35.264 --> 01:30:36.057
Oh.

1106
01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:38.725
- Easy, Major.

1107
01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:41.810
I thought you said you were
trained in the medical.


1108
01:30:41.812 --> 01:30:42.769
- Aye.

1109
01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:45.189
Dr. Craik gave me a lesson
before we left camp.


1110
01:30:45.191 --> 01:30:48.192
He said the main thing
is to clean the wound, so


1111
01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:49.320
I cleaned the wound.

1112
01:30:57.536 --> 01:31:00.331
Congratulations on your first
military victory, Colonel.


1113
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:02.582
- What are the casualties?

1114
01:31:05.086 --> 01:31:07.546
- One killed, sir. 
Three wounded.

1115
01:31:09.382 --> 01:31:10.216
- Very well.

1116
01:31:11.342 --> 01:31:13.758
Pass on my compliments to your men.

1117
01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.012
- Aye, Colonel.

1118
01:36:57.353 --> 01:36:58.519
- [Woman] Do you want another pint, love.

1119
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.731
- [Man] I'll take
a pint, and some love.

1120
01:37:00.733 --> 01:37:03.108
- [Woman] Oh, you always
joke and your never funny.


1121
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:05.445
- [Man] Can't knock a man for trying.

1122
01:37:06.071 --> 01:37:07.278
- [Man] Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

1123
01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.116
We have to trade for the Ohio.

1124
01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:33.805
- Might I have a
minute of your time, sir?

1125
01:37:33.807 --> 01:37:35.974
- Well, that dear lady would depend upon

1126
01:37:35.976 --> 01:37:39.270
what you propose we do with
the time ye be soliciting.


1127
01:37:40.689 --> 01:37:42.689
- I wish to contribute
to my husband's defense


1128
01:37:42.691 --> 01:37:44.234
of Colonel George Washington.

1129
01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:48.361
- I should think you'd be
entirely content with your


1130
01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:50.656
tea parties and needle work,

1131
01:37:50.658 --> 01:37:53.661
and happily leave the
politicking to the men.
