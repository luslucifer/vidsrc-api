00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:30.510
THE WORLD UNSEEN

2
00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:50.910
Cape Town, South Africa, 1952

3
00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:01.590
Bastards!

4
00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:03.143
Good day, Amina.

5
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.996
Sergeant.

6
00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.086
Good day, Jacob.

7
00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:12.551
Sergeant Stewart.

8
00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:15.260
So, she finally got the place opened?

9
00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:17.126
Nice business to have.

10
00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:19.187
I imagine it is.

11
00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.344
These new laws are making life
bloody hard for the police.


12
00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:33.144
They're not making it a picnic
for the rest of us either.


13
00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.129
My colleague's waiting in the car.

14
00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:39.372
He has a problem with
this sort of thing.


15
00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:43.032
You know it's an offence for blacks
to eat in the same place as whites.


16
00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.179
There are no whites here.

17
00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.076
Present company excluded.

18
00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.156
As non-blacks then.

19
00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:52.044
This is an Indian area.

20
00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.338
Maybe coloureds, but no blacks.

21
00:02:57.645 --> 00:02:58.629
Passports.

22
00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.290
You know they have passes.

23
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.365
I want to see them. Now!

24
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.703
This is only a travel permit.

25
00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:11.560
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.688
Where's your pass?

27
00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:13.868
But I don't have a pass, sir.

28
00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:15.571
I'm coloured, not black.

29
00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.631
Yeah, you look like a Kaffir to me.

30
00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.617
Her father was Dutch,

31
00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:21.188
like mine.

32
00:03:21.188 --> 00:03:23.482
You understand, Jacob, it's
going to be difficult...


33
00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:27.256
Stewart, what are you talking
to these people for?


34
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.237
Calm down.

35
00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:34.822
You keep serving blacks and
we'll kill the lot of them.


36
00:03:43.738 --> 00:03:46.646
Ma'am, it would be safer
for you to leave now.


37
00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:48.239
You don't have to pay for the...

38
00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.437
I can finish my coffee, mister ...?

39
00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:51.484
Williams.

40
00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:53.353
Jacob Williams.

41
00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:54.727
I'm Madeline Smith.

42
00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:56.579
You run the post office.

43
00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.493
Well, you come in it.

44
00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:02.948
You're Amina's business partner,
aren't you?


45
00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:07.648
Ah, well, no,
I just work for Amina.


46
00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:10.064
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

47
00:04:10.064 --> 00:04:13.305
Partnership would be illegal,
wouldn't it?


48
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.253
Thank you, for shielding me
from the police.


49
00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.867
Would you excuse me?

50
00:04:36.828 --> 00:04:38.139
What is it?

51
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:40.625
My grandmother.

52
00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.434
We'll get a new glass,
a new frame.


53
00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:46.362
Are you OK?

54
00:04:47.484 --> 00:04:48.850
And you?

55
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.553
I'm not so old that I can't
dive for cover.


56
00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:54.355
Not to mention
flirt with the customers.


57
00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:16.611
Milk...

58
00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:25.482
<i>Come in here and get ready
for school, both of you!</i>


59
00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:27.807
Thank God we are moving out
in a couple of months...


60
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.901
before the next one comes.

61
00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:33.457
Say goodbye to papa.

62
00:05:38.142 --> 00:05:39.732
OK, Sam, Yasmine, upstairs!

63
00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:42.359
Go! Brush your teeth, get your books!

64
00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:45.835
Off!

65
00:06:04.533 --> 00:06:05.852
He said yes.

66
00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:07.182
We can go.

67
00:06:07.182 --> 00:06:08.081
Where?

68
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:09.050
Out for lunch!

69
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.659
To the "Location Café".

70
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:13.598
I can't believe our husbands
are letting us out of here.


71
00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:15.457
Come on, Miriam. Get dressed!

72
00:06:32.574 --> 00:06:33.766
Good morning!

73
00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:41.614
I'm so sorry.
Amina, I'm sorry.


74
00:06:41.614 --> 00:06:43.327
Thank you, Doris.

75
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.786
Please, leave it.

76
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.996
They have staff to do that.

77
00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:59.450
Good morning, ladies.

78
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.861
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


79
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:04.437
Our special today is lamb bredie
and I have some nice fresh "koeksisters".


80
00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:06.470
What are "koeksisters"?

81
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.681
It's a South African delicacy.

82
00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:12.427
A fried doughnut
with syrup and coconut.


83
00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:14.117
Here, try one!

84
00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:15.718
See if you like it.

85
00:07:24.301 --> 00:07:25.948
It's delicious.

86
00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:30.862
Good. I'll send some over and I promise
I'll try not to drop them this time.


87
00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:36.182
She thinks a lot of herself.

88
00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:38.116
Maybe she should.

89
00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:40.741
She owns a business and
she's one of us.


90
00:07:41.063 --> 00:07:42.340
No, she's not.

91
00:07:42.684 --> 00:07:45.055
Where do you see any of
our girls looking like that?


92
00:07:45.055 --> 00:07:45.888
Like what?

93
00:07:45.888 --> 00:07:48.262
Are you blind?!

94
00:07:48.262 --> 00:07:49.885
Like a man.

95
00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:54.500
Maybe it's easier to work
in trousers.


96
00:08:08.348 --> 00:08:09.880
Daddy, is it far?

97
00:08:10.253 --> 00:08:12.908
I told you, Delhof's in the country.
You'll like it there.


98
00:08:14.168 --> 00:08:16.306
Will we have a house there
like our old one?


99
00:08:16.524 --> 00:08:18.972
We'll get a much bigger & better
than the old one.


100
00:08:18.972 --> 00:08:20.256
With a big shop underneath.

101
00:08:20.256 --> 00:08:21.859
Who'll work in it?

102
00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:25.449
I will. And your mother. And we'll
have a boy to help us.


103
00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.976
And we'll have a night watchman
to guard the place at night.


104
00:08:45.528 --> 00:08:47.346
Shall we leave?

105
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:58.443
We'll need to work hard,
that's all.


106
00:11:12.817 --> 00:11:15.377
She would've been
proud of you.


107
00:11:32.266 --> 00:11:33.805
Hello, Bhai.

108
00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:37.172
Mrs Benjamin is making
some tea.


109
00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.868
She says you should
go and help her.


110
00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:44.173
How hard is it
to make tea?


111
00:11:49.222 --> 00:11:51.932
Here. It will give you
some energy.


112
00:11:53.822 --> 00:11:55.098
Are you OK?

113
00:11:55.344 --> 00:11:56.741
Shall I call her?

114
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:58.579
No.

115
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:03.335
No, I'm OK.

116
00:12:04.412 --> 00:12:05.631
Going already?

117
00:12:05.631 --> 00:12:07.325
Yes, I need to go
to the shop.


118
00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:09.464
Don't worry about it.
Your sister-in-law's there.


119
00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:14.746
Here, love. You have
a nice cup of tea.


120
00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:16.313
Thank you, Mrs Benjamin.

121
00:12:16.313 --> 00:12:18.738
He's not one for a chat,
is he?


122
00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:22.794
No, he's not.

123
00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:31.080
There's nobody here.

124
00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:35.764
I don't know who you think is
going to come flooding in


125
00:12:35.764 --> 00:12:39.440
to buy groceries at this
time of day. Or any time.


126
00:12:42.278 --> 00:12:43.699
Where's the boy?

127
00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:44.633
Robert?

128
00:12:46.311 --> 00:12:48.383
He's making deliveries.
He'll be back.


129
00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:49.663
Later?

130
00:12:50.446 --> 00:12:51.814
What are you doing?

131
00:12:52.203 --> 00:12:54.605
Has it been so long that you
don't even remember?


132
00:12:56.486 --> 00:12:59.380
I suppose she doesn't like you
to touch her when she's pregnant.


133
00:13:18.588 --> 00:13:21.072
You come to Cape Town
once a week...


134
00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:23.255
Come and see me.

135
00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.508
Sit down.

136
00:13:47.946 --> 00:13:49.501
So what do you do
after school?


137
00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:50.983
Homework.

138
00:13:50.983 --> 00:13:52.858
Good... Good.

139
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:57.810
Do it then.

140
00:13:58.327 --> 00:13:59.843
I don't have any homework.

141
00:13:59.843 --> 00:14:00.662
Why not?

142
00:14:00.662 --> 00:14:01.948
She's only five.

143
00:14:01.948 --> 00:14:05.063
She doesn't get homework
until big school.


144
00:14:08.444 --> 00:14:09.959
Hello, mister Husband.

145
00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:12.170
Or should I say: mister Father?

146
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.176
Is it a boy?

147
00:14:13.176 --> 00:14:14.221
What a question!

148
00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:18.465
You have a beautiful baby girl.

149
00:14:31.335 --> 00:14:32.594
My son!

150
00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:35.310
I have traveled
so long to see you.


151
00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:50.950
All these Africans!

152
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.939
That's the problem
with this country:


153
00:14:54.368 --> 00:14:56.073
too many black people.

154
00:14:56.287 --> 00:15:00.234
You should come home my son,
it is a better life.


155
00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:02.635
How will Amina find a good
husband here?


156
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.710
There are plenty of families
when she's ready.


157
00:15:05.843 --> 00:15:08.235
Of course she's ready!
Where is she anyway?


158
00:15:08.235 --> 00:15:09.563
She's work--

159
00:15:10.692 --> 00:15:11.729
She couldn't come.

160
00:15:12.001 --> 00:15:12.962
Working?

161
00:15:13.171 --> 00:15:14.709
Did you say she's working?

162
00:15:14.922 --> 00:15:16.080
Where is she working?

163
00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:18.636
Cape Town.

164
00:15:20.704 --> 00:15:24.149
The girl needs to be brought back
to a decent way of living.


165
00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:27.088
Why is she working?
What is she doing?


166
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.010
She must mix more.
I know a family.


167
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.479
The Alis. Do you know them?

168
00:15:34.479 --> 00:15:37.746
- Yes.
- Invite them for dinner, on Sunday.


169
00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:40.802
Your son never lets us
invite anyone.


170
00:15:45.923 --> 00:15:47.522
Amina will never come.

171
00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:50.715
It is Amina's duty to be
where we tell her.


172
00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:52.576
She will come.

173
00:15:58.738 --> 00:16:02.141
Amina, you're late. They're here
already. Hurry up inside.


174
00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:03.164
Who's here?

175
00:16:03.772 --> 00:16:04.718
Where are you going?

176
00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:05.914
Inside?

177
00:16:05.914 --> 00:16:06.950
Like this?

178
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.544
Like this.
Mum, this is who I am.


179
00:16:10.544 --> 00:16:12.084
What else
do you want me to wear?


180
00:16:31.459 --> 00:16:33.178
I'll help you serve the food.

181
00:16:34.943 --> 00:16:37.935
I don't see why people say
that our girls are too modern.


182
00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:41.605
They may want to go out for a while
and find out things for themselves.


183
00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:47.169
But I think our girls always find it
best to stay at home in the end.


184
00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:48.741
Doesn't Amina
work anymore then?


185
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:50.685
Only now and then.

186
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.247
- But what about the caf--
- Why isn't anybody eating?


187
00:16:53.627 --> 00:16:57.464
Things have been so busy
at the garage lately.


188
00:16:57.738 --> 00:17:00.333
I don't have time to stop
for one minute.


189
00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:03.612
Sometimes I wish
Amina was helping me again.


190
00:17:05.116 --> 00:17:07.470
And how many children
would you like, Amina?


191
00:17:07.691 --> 00:17:12.652
Oh, I don't know... I suppose
two or three would be nice.


192
00:17:12.915 --> 00:17:13.810
Do you want only boys?

193
00:17:13.954 --> 00:17:16.065
What would make you think
I'd want boys at all?


194
00:17:16.264 --> 00:17:18.065
What a rubbish!
Everybody wants a boy.


195
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:19.772
Everybody!

196
00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:21.300
Well, I'm not everybody.

197
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.175
And I wouldn't care
if I had a boy or a girl


198
00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:25.222
as long as the child was
healthy and happy.


199
00:17:25.436 --> 00:17:27.576
Nothing else really matters, does it?

200
00:17:28.178 --> 00:17:29.233
I think she's right.

201
00:17:29.828 --> 00:17:31.957
I think it's time for desert.

202
00:17:42.693 --> 00:17:44.462
We're going to Cape Town
on the weekend.


203
00:17:45.183 --> 00:17:46.437
All of us?

204
00:17:48.649 --> 00:17:50.183
Do you remember
when this came?


205
00:17:50.982 --> 00:17:52.267
Two weeks ago.

206
00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:54.603
It's from my sister, Rehmat.

207
00:17:54.603 --> 00:17:56.612
The one in Paris?

208
00:17:58.664 --> 00:17:59.842
Who told you that?

209
00:18:00.542 --> 00:18:01.985
Farah.

210
00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:06.412
She's coming with her husband.

211
00:18:08.363 --> 00:18:10.549
I'm going to go to sleep.
You watch the shop.


212
00:19:00.635 --> 00:19:02.548
Farah, come and help me here!

213
00:19:02.548 --> 00:19:04.074
They'll be here
any minute now.


214
00:19:04.074 --> 00:19:06.130
And you know
how particular Omar is.


215
00:19:07.676 --> 00:19:09.669
Not as much
as he likes to think.


216
00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:16.888
They're here!

217
00:19:16.888 --> 00:19:18.340
<i>I'm cooking!</i>

218
00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:26.667
Well, where is she?

219
00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:28.472
She's gone to the hotel
to meet James.


220
00:19:28.745 --> 00:19:31.104
That's a stupid thing to do.

221
00:19:31.672 --> 00:19:33.196
Are they trying to get caught?

222
00:19:33.196 --> 00:19:34.726
They shouldn't even be here.

223
00:19:34.726 --> 00:19:37.196
- He's father's dying.
- So what?!


224
00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:39.246
He'll be dead in a week and
they'll be in jail.


225
00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:40.762
Do they think
the police care?


226
00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:42.712
Which hotel is he staying at?

227
00:19:42.712 --> 00:19:43.917
At "The Royal".

228
00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:45.110
If you can believe it.

229
00:19:48.195 --> 00:19:50.080
I don't know who they
think they are.


230
00:20:00.864 --> 00:20:02.864
And this is my other
sister-in-law.


231
00:20:02.864 --> 00:20:04.184
This is Miriam.

232
00:20:04.184 --> 00:20:05.558
Hello.

233
00:20:08.097 --> 00:20:09.568
It took me a while
to get used to it.


234
00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:12.163
Paris must be such a nightmare
to get used to.


235
00:20:12.572 --> 00:20:15.036
I meant that it
wasn't home, at first,


236
00:20:15.283 --> 00:20:16.876
for either of us.

237
00:20:16.876 --> 00:20:19.808
But then I realised that
there were no gossiping neighbours,


238
00:20:19.808 --> 00:20:23.065
no list of rules,
no need to stay home


239
00:20:23.287 --> 00:20:24.909
if I wanted to work.

240
00:20:25.087 --> 00:20:27.812
We were very sorry to hear
about your father's illness.


241
00:20:27.812 --> 00:20:30.566
He gave us
his blessing, finally.


242
00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:33.463
I suppose death can give you
a different perspective


243
00:20:33.463 --> 00:20:35.003
on what's important.

244
00:20:35.003 --> 00:20:36.959
And now eating here
with all of you and


245
00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:39.552
at the time
that seemed impossible.


246
00:20:39.552 --> 00:20:41.098
Aren't you afraid?

247
00:20:41.098 --> 00:20:43.113
Of what could happen
if you get caught?


248
00:20:43.113 --> 00:20:44.946
My husband is an idealist.

249
00:20:44.946 --> 00:20:46.906
We have no time for idealists
these days.


250
00:20:46.906 --> 00:20:48.167
We have to be practical.

251
00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:50.363
Get what we can
whenever we can.


252
00:20:50.857 --> 00:20:54.018
You know, my husband and you,
you could be twins.


253
00:20:56.309 --> 00:20:58.550
We are twins.

254
00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:04.079
Why couldn't you tell me?

255
00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:07.524
Men never tell you anything.

256
00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:17.009
Miriam, why don't we
get my brother


257
00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.989
to take us
to the "Location Café"?


258
00:21:18.989 --> 00:21:20.976
I used to sneak out and go
over there all the time


259
00:21:20.976 --> 00:21:23.353
on my school breaks.

260
00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:25.993
I should stay and help.

261
00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:28.582
Bhabhi, you go, I'll take care
of the children.


262
00:21:29.878 --> 00:21:31.677
Farah can make us tea.

263
00:22:01.293 --> 00:22:03.041
Is that the Harjan girl?

264
00:22:03.749 --> 00:22:06.267
She's young and she
owns this place, huh?


265
00:22:06.267 --> 00:22:07.288
With a partner.

266
00:22:07.288 --> 00:22:10.354
Imagine at her age to be the
partner of a business


267
00:22:10.354 --> 00:22:12.096
and a good business too!

268
00:22:12.342 --> 00:22:14.202
Sunday is always her
busiest day.


269
00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:16.069
I think she's done well
for one of our girls.


270
00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:17.582
So do I.

271
00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:20.145
She's not totally
one of our girls.


272
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.397
Have you ever seen one
of our girls with such...


273
00:22:23.397 --> 00:22:24.886
with such curly hair?

274
00:22:25.307 --> 00:22:27.137
Are you saying
that she's part black?


275
00:22:28.777 --> 00:22:30.585
That's her grandmother, Begum.

276
00:22:30.585 --> 00:22:32.686
The child is Amina's mother.

277
00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.200
There was a big scandal.

278
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.177
She messed around
with the Africans.


279
00:22:38.412 --> 00:22:40.229
Should I pretend to be horrified?

280
00:22:40.229 --> 00:22:43.082
You know, plenty of white people,
including some of his family,


281
00:22:43.082 --> 00:22:45.605
would sit there one day, just like
you, all self-righteous,


282
00:22:45.605 --> 00:22:47.788
and accuse my children
of being half-Indian.


283
00:22:47.995 --> 00:22:48.771
That's not
the same thing.


284
00:22:48.771 --> 00:22:50.714
It's exactly the same thing.

285
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:53.109
How can you
live here, Omar?


286
00:22:53.109 --> 00:22:54.863
How can you bear
to be in this place?


287
00:22:54.863 --> 00:22:56.699
South Africa is my home.

288
00:23:06.898 --> 00:23:10.317
You wanted ten pence worth...
here you are...


289
00:23:28.072 --> 00:23:30.586
I'd like to serve someone
over here, please.


290
00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.829
WHITES               NON-WHITES
ONLY                          ONLY


291
00:23:50.902 --> 00:23:52.088
I love South Africa.

292
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.743
What do you love about it?

293
00:23:53.743 --> 00:23:55.151
The freedom, the space.

294
00:23:55.151 --> 00:23:56.427
It's not like India.

295
00:23:56.427 --> 00:23:59.187
No, it's not.
It's much worse.


296
00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:01.348
And God help anyone
who tries to fight it.


297
00:24:01.348 --> 00:24:04.928
I fight it. And I think
you probably did too.


298
00:24:05.223 --> 00:24:06.994
I fought so hard

299
00:24:07.383 --> 00:24:11.648
I had to leave
with bruises on my face.


300
00:24:17.035 --> 00:24:19.562
Do you still like "koeksisters"?

301
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.964
Yes, I do.

302
00:24:20.964 --> 00:24:23.585
And have you had any since
that were better?


303
00:24:25.144 --> 00:24:26.113
Never.

304
00:24:26.113 --> 00:24:28.594
Good. I'll send some over.
They're frying now.


305
00:24:28.594 --> 00:24:31.032
Amina, this gentleman here
is looking for


306
00:24:31.032 --> 00:24:33.020
someone to help
build him a garden.


307
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.786
You want it or know
someone who would?


308
00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:36.148
I want a vegetable garden,

309
00:24:36.148 --> 00:24:38.061
behind my house,
back with a shop.


310
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:39.362
I can do it.

311
00:24:39.362 --> 00:24:40.534
I want a big space.

312
00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:42.717
I need enough to sell
not just to eat.


313
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.120
If you want me
to do it, I can.


314
00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:46.732
Can you come early?

315
00:24:46.732 --> 00:24:48.472
How about seven?

316
00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:17.400
Hello.

317
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.159
That's the patch I'd like you to do.

318
00:25:19.159 --> 00:25:22.045
Mummy, why is she wearing trousers?

319
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.116
Because she works outside.

320
00:25:26.934 --> 00:25:28.036
Don't forget their lunch.

321
00:25:28.036 --> 00:25:29.251
Thank you, Robert.

322
00:25:29.508 --> 00:25:32.789
Robert, give the young lady some chapatis
and some tea when she starts working


323
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:34.685
and there's fig jam
in the fridge, yeah?


324
00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:36.185
Come.

325
00:25:43.226 --> 00:25:44.455
Good morning.

326
00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:45.905
Hello.

327
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.903
Say hello to the lady.

328
00:25:47.903 --> 00:25:49.671
Hello, Ma'am.

329
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.869
Come on!

330
00:25:56.227 --> 00:25:57.526
Bye!

331
00:26:36.146 --> 00:26:37.905
I... I brought you some food.

332
00:26:40.658 --> 00:26:41.965
Thank you.

333
00:26:43.215 --> 00:26:44.467
It smells delicious.

334
00:26:45.114 --> 00:26:46.795
I wish I could cook so well.

335
00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:48.339
But you work in a café.

336
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.221
All Jacob's recipes.

337
00:26:52.097 --> 00:26:53.609
Well, then you should learn.

338
00:26:53.609 --> 00:26:55.058
So my mother tells me.

339
00:26:55.058 --> 00:26:56.307
Your mother's right.

340
00:26:56.307 --> 00:26:58.379
What will you do
when you get married?


341
00:26:58.858 --> 00:26:59.839
I don't know, I suppose
I'll have to


342
00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:02.830
find someone who can cook.

343
00:27:06.202 --> 00:27:07.983
Have you eaten?

344
00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:09.751
Why don't you join me?

345
00:27:10.338 --> 00:27:12.317
I have to mind the shop.

346
00:27:21.741 --> 00:27:23.699
I just want
to know you better.


347
00:27:24.828 --> 00:27:27.934
I'm just a housewife
and a mother.


348
00:27:27.934 --> 00:27:29.939
And doesn't a housewife have
thoughts and feelings


349
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:32.404
and wishes,
just like everyone else?


350
00:27:36.184 --> 00:27:39.339
You were the first person to
smile at me at the café...


351
00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:42.032
...in eight days.

352
00:27:45.154 --> 00:27:47.048
I count it!

353
00:28:28.053 --> 00:28:29.613
What's this?

354
00:28:30.155 --> 00:28:31.530
Poetry.

355
00:28:35.768 --> 00:28:37.094
I can't take it.

356
00:28:37.094 --> 00:28:38.326
Don't you like reading?

357
00:28:38.326 --> 00:28:39.937
I love reading.

358
00:28:41.139 --> 00:28:43.015
I mean I used to...

359
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:44.878
I used to read a lot...

360
00:28:46.804 --> 00:28:49.275
Please, keep it then.

361
00:28:51.264 --> 00:28:53.087
Stay for dinner.

362
00:28:53.087 --> 00:28:54.666
I should get going.

363
00:28:55.843 --> 00:28:57.979
No, you can't
drive at night.


364
00:28:57.979 --> 00:28:58.639
I'll be fine.

365
00:28:58.639 --> 00:29:00.833
No. Maybe in town
but here...


366
00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:03.398
The roads are just tracks.

367
00:29:04.415 --> 00:29:05.817
Stay.

368
00:29:48.814 --> 00:29:52.179
If you're going to stay,
you should come inside.


369
00:29:53.695 --> 00:29:55.690
Your husband's not back yet?

370
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.460
He works late in Cape Town.

371
00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.708
Usually he stays at his sister-in-...

372
00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:02.457
brother's place.

373
00:30:05.842 --> 00:30:06.829
The daal was delicious.

374
00:30:06.829 --> 00:30:08.736
Do you want some more?

375
00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:10.847
No, I would like to
clean up though.


376
00:30:11.244 --> 00:30:13.599
There's hot water
in the bathroom. Come.


377
00:30:57.712 --> 00:30:59.558
What are you doing?

378
00:31:05.227 --> 00:31:06.474
I couldn't sleep.

379
00:31:07.083 --> 00:31:08.510
Me neither.

380
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.787
Let me get you some tea.

381
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.411
I'll make the tea,
Miriam.


382
00:31:18.608 --> 00:31:21.634
Miriam is always
getting the tea for everyone.


383
00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:30.588
Tell me...

384
00:31:30.902 --> 00:31:32.895
Has anyone ever
looked after you?


385
00:31:40.936 --> 00:31:42.964
When did you come
to South Africa?


386
00:31:44.354 --> 00:31:47.200
Seven years ago,
after I got married.


387
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.634
Me too!

388
00:31:49.729 --> 00:31:51.781
Our first evening
off of a boat from India


389
00:31:51.781 --> 00:31:54.282
and we walk straight into
the Indian congress protest.


390
00:31:54.282 --> 00:31:58.536
There were sticks and guns
and policemen. I was...


391
00:31:59.255 --> 00:32:00.385
...terrified.

392
00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:01.585
I was there.

393
00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:03.533
Protesting The Ghetto Bill.

394
00:32:03.533 --> 00:32:06.638
I thought we could overthrow
the government in two weeks.


395
00:32:10.881 --> 00:32:13.305
Is there anything
that you don't do?


396
00:32:14.929 --> 00:32:18.036
I have to give people
something to talk about.


397
00:32:18.265 --> 00:32:21.917
Do you ever think about getting married
and having children instead?


398
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.712
Yeah, it's that word "instead"
I don't like.


399
00:32:24.712 --> 00:32:26.838
Why can't a woman do both
if she wants to?


400
00:32:27.136 --> 00:32:28.354
It's not usual.

401
00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:32.190
No. But neither am I,
and neither are you.


402
00:32:35.546 --> 00:32:37.963
Where did you learn
to think like this?


403
00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:40.797
My grandmother...

404
00:32:40.797 --> 00:32:42.434
My mother's mother...

405
00:32:42.434 --> 00:32:44.096
The picture in the café?

406
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.313
She lived here once before
she was sent back to India.


407
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:51.137
You must have heard
someone's version of the story.


408
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.104
There's always gossip...

409
00:32:54.812 --> 00:32:58.909
Tell me the story. The real story,
if you don't mind.


410
00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:01.777
I'd like to tell you.

411
00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:06.272
I think you'd understand why my
grandmother was so important to me.


412
00:33:06.736 --> 00:33:08.221
What happened to her?

413
00:33:18.868 --> 00:33:20.845
She was 19,

414
00:33:21.134 --> 00:33:23.454
with one child already.

415
00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:31.073
And shame and dishonour of being
rapped, she tried to hide it.


416
00:33:32.502 --> 00:33:34.942
But she became pregnant.

417
00:33:36.564 --> 00:33:40.920
As soon as the baby was born,
my mother,


418
00:33:41.192 --> 00:33:43.918
they realised
it wasn't her husband's.


419
00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:46.102
What did they do to her?

420
00:34:06.885 --> 00:34:08.906
They put her
on a train to Durban,


421
00:34:09.524 --> 00:34:11.710
to get a boat to Bombay.

422
00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:35.376
Hold him out so I can kiss him.
Please... Please...


423
00:34:35.376 --> 00:34:36.148
No!

424
00:34:36.148 --> 00:34:40.404
No! Stop! Stop the train! No!

425
00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:44.060
No! Stop! No!

426
00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:56.586
I can't imagine
losing a child like that.


427
00:34:56.586 --> 00:34:58.538
It broke her.

428
00:34:59.477 --> 00:35:03.325
She didn't have one choice
to make her whole life.


429
00:35:04.146 --> 00:35:05.800
And for as long
as I can remember


430
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:11.065
she always warned be about the dangers
of being oppressed in a marriage.


431
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:13.656
Is that why you
haven't gotten married?


432
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.686
That's not the only reason.

433
00:35:25.294 --> 00:35:27.053
Miriam?

434
00:35:27.842 --> 00:35:29.614
Yes?

435
00:35:32.147 --> 00:35:33.645
Nothing.

436
00:35:33.645 --> 00:35:36.010
You should go,
the baby needs you.


437
00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:01.481
Sam? Yasmine!

438
00:36:02.099 --> 00:36:04.336
Auntie Amina was showing
us the garden.


439
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:06.546
Are you ready for school?

440
00:36:07.887 --> 00:36:09.180
Did you eat?

441
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.926
Auntie Amina gave us some
breakfast.


442
00:36:13.942 --> 00:36:15.009
Here we go.

443
00:36:15.009 --> 00:36:15.767
OK.

444
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.287
I've never imagined
I'd be so domesticated.


445
00:36:19.398 --> 00:36:21.417
I've never imagined anything else.

446
00:36:22.063 --> 00:36:24.432
OK, kids. You ready for school?

447
00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:25.915
Come on.

448
00:36:26.974 --> 00:36:28.512
Have a good day!

449
00:36:32.936 --> 00:36:34.661
Can I make you
some breakfast?


450
00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:36.630
Perhaps later.

451
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.200
I'm going to start work.

452
00:36:43.986 --> 00:36:48.811
I hope I didn't worry you with all my
strange ideas and stories last night.


453
00:36:50.729 --> 00:36:53.230
No, you made me think
and that's


454
00:36:53.813 --> 00:36:57.337
supposed to be a good thing,
isn't it?


455
00:36:57.681 --> 00:36:59.488
That depends on who you ask.

456
00:37:04.275 --> 00:37:05.820
What are you doing?

457
00:37:08.472 --> 00:37:09.575
Reading.

458
00:37:09.575 --> 00:37:12.577
I can see that.
Reading what?!


459
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.817
Poetry.

460
00:37:16.806 --> 00:37:18.199
Poetry.

461
00:37:18.415 --> 00:37:20.137
At this time of night?!

462
00:37:22.156 --> 00:37:23.442
I'm tired.

463
00:37:24.782 --> 00:37:26.961
I was busy
in Cape Town today.


464
00:37:26.961 --> 00:37:29.065
With her?

465
00:37:29.297 --> 00:37:30.980
What did you say?

466
00:37:32.666 --> 00:37:34.116
Nothing.

467
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:55.275
<i>"Love bade me welcome,</i>

468
00:37:55.717 --> 00:37:57.597
<i>yet my soul drew back,</i>

469
00:37:57.597 --> 00:37:59.770
<i>Guilty of dust and sin.</i>

470
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.702
<i>But quick-ey'd Love,</i>

471
00:38:01.702 --> 00:38:03.309
observing me grow slack

472
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:05.701
From my first entrance in,

473
00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:09.066
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning

474
00:38:09.066 --> 00:38:11.197
If I lack'd anything.

475
00:38:11.197 --> 00:38:14.505
"A guest," I answer'd, "worthy to be here";

476
00:38:14.773 --> 00:38:17.820
Love said, "You shall be he."

477
00:38:19.518 --> 00:38:20.705
Afternoon.

478
00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:22.423
We need to ask you
some questions.


479
00:38:22.423 --> 00:38:24.298
My husband is not here,
he just left.


480
00:38:24.298 --> 00:38:26.257
Yeah, we must've
just missed him.


481
00:38:26.516 --> 00:38:28.320
Robert, get these gentlemen
a drink.


482
00:38:31.704 --> 00:38:33.159
It's a good shop
you have here.


483
00:38:34.036 --> 00:38:34.891
Thank you.

484
00:38:36.474 --> 00:38:38.201
Is your sister-in-law here?

485
00:38:39.892 --> 00:38:42.556
My brother-in-law
and his wife stay in town.


486
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:47.657
We're looking for Rehmat Winston.

487
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.196
And we know
she's staying with you.


488
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.030
They're not here.

489
00:38:53.527 --> 00:38:55.147
So you know where they are.

490
00:39:08.255 --> 00:39:10.085
Listen.

491
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.040
You'll be in a pile of shit
if you help them.


492
00:39:14.803 --> 00:39:16.709
What have they done?

493
00:39:17.604 --> 00:39:21.263
Have you heard of the Prohibition
of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949?


494
00:39:21.518 --> 00:39:23.198
It's there for a reason.

495
00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:28.072
To stop this depravity.

496
00:39:28.471 --> 00:39:32.162
It's against nature what these
people are doing.


497
00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:34.960
Home from school.

498
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.736
No, you can't.

499
00:39:35.736 --> 00:39:36.519
Yes, we can.

500
00:39:36.519 --> 00:39:38.858
They may be witholding
valuable information.


501
00:39:38.858 --> 00:39:41.013
No! No! Please!

502
00:39:41.013 --> 00:39:42.516
Have you ever been to a
police station, young lady?


503
00:39:42.516 --> 00:39:44.472
Where are we going?

504
00:39:44.472 --> 00:39:45.627
Stop!

505
00:39:48.105 --> 00:39:49.722
We'll bring them back later.

506
00:39:49.722 --> 00:39:51.656
Or tomorrow, whenever
we get time.


507
00:39:52.274 --> 00:39:53.815
No, I'll tell you
where they are!


508
00:39:53.815 --> 00:39:55.077
Too late!

509
00:39:58.155 --> 00:40:00.909
So? Where are they?

510
00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.905
Where are they?

511
00:40:03.843 --> 00:40:05.256
In Cape Town.

512
00:40:07.422 --> 00:40:09.584
At my brother-in-law's.

513
00:40:10.524 --> 00:40:12.293
You know, if you're lying,

514
00:40:12.293 --> 00:40:15.548
I'll beat you, and your children,
and your baby!


515
00:40:53.943 --> 00:40:56.502
I need help. The police
are after us.


516
00:40:56.846 --> 00:40:57.703
We can't.

517
00:40:57.703 --> 00:40:59.162
Amina, you have to.

518
00:40:59.162 --> 00:41:00.857
We can't help you.

519
00:41:01.124 --> 00:41:02.000
I'm sorry.

520
00:41:04.274 --> 00:41:05.774
Please, please, sit.

521
00:41:06.032 --> 00:41:09.269
I understand. It's just...
I don't know what to do.


522
00:41:09.692 --> 00:41:11.089
If we helped you
in front of the customers,


523
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:13.210
someone would break when the
police start threatening.


524
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.981
Are you sure?

525
00:41:18.121 --> 00:41:20.346
Thank you for this,
I...


526
00:41:29.059 --> 00:41:31.211
You were supposed to tell us.

527
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.067
In front of my husband?!

528
00:41:37.507 --> 00:41:42.231
Was I supposed to tell it while she
could hear me, hiding upstairs?


529
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:45.355
What kind of state police don't
even search the house?


530
00:41:49.843 --> 00:41:52.364
Where are they now?

531
00:41:54.224 --> 00:41:55.811
Some nice clothes...

532
00:41:55.811 --> 00:41:57.609
French labels.

533
00:41:58.428 --> 00:42:00.204
We'll find them.

534
00:42:00.204 --> 00:42:03.775
You'll be the next,
for helping them.


535
00:42:07.463 --> 00:42:09.512
I'm not stupid.

536
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:14.528
But there is someone around
here who is.


537
00:42:16.219 --> 00:42:19.602
And it won't be the first time
she's in trouble with the two of you.


538
00:42:45.008 --> 00:42:47.216
Stop that bloody noise!

539
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:56.340
Jacob.

540
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.420
Sergeant?

541
00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.309
We're looking
for an Indian woman.


542
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:02.520
Indians is all
we get in here.


543
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.637
But you're welcome
to have a look around.


544
00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:06.589
Where's Amina?

545
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:07.534
She's having a nap.

546
00:43:07.534 --> 00:43:09.103
She'll be taking over
from me shortly.


547
00:43:09.103 --> 00:43:11.291
I'm not as young
as I used to be.


548
00:43:24.785 --> 00:43:25.879
I know she's here.

549
00:43:26.512 --> 00:43:27.309
Who?

550
00:43:35.366 --> 00:43:36.812
Open this up!

551
00:43:38.189 --> 00:43:38.949
Go, go, go!

552
00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.373
Open it!

553
00:43:46.732 --> 00:43:47.798
What's all that?

554
00:43:47.798 --> 00:43:49.617
Stock for the café.

555
00:43:50.989 --> 00:43:52.694
That's why I keep it locked.

556
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.801
Those Kaffirs would steal anything.

557
00:43:58.587 --> 00:44:00.973
Tell me where she is!

558
00:44:02.281 --> 00:44:04.573
I really don't know who you're
talking about.


559
00:44:04.922 --> 00:44:07.482
You and I both know that I've
had some women in here, but this time even I...


560
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:10.550
Stinkin' queer!

561
00:44:29.322 --> 00:44:31.257
Hey, yours is the only place in town

562
00:44:31.257 --> 00:44:33.535
where Kaffir workers
eat alongside Indians.


563
00:44:33.535 --> 00:44:35.344
You get away with it.

564
00:44:35.344 --> 00:44:36.921
Yes.

565
00:44:36.921 --> 00:44:39.995
I could've closed you down
anytime, couldn't I?


566
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:43.772
Yes.

567
00:44:43.772 --> 00:44:44.522
So?

568
00:44:46.475 --> 00:44:48.174
Was she here?

569
00:44:48.174 --> 00:44:48.924
No.

570
00:44:50.141 --> 00:44:51.653
Where is she?

571
00:44:51.653 --> 00:44:54.301
I really don't know.

572
00:44:55.914 --> 00:44:57.637
I'm sorry.

573
00:45:05.261 --> 00:45:06.424
Who's that?

574
00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.914
If it's the police, then I'll deal
with them this time.


575
00:45:12.137 --> 00:45:13.388
Someone's here.

576
00:45:13.592 --> 00:45:14.713
My goddamn truck.

577
00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:15.177
What happened?

578
00:45:15.177 --> 00:45:16.942
My lights have gone.

579
00:45:16.942 --> 00:45:18.902
Hit a bloody Kaffir
walking in the yard,


580
00:45:18.902 --> 00:45:20.277
pulling right in my way.

581
00:45:20.499 --> 00:45:23.463
Thought it was just one side he caught,
but both my lights have gone.


582
00:45:23.463 --> 00:45:24.857
We might have one of those.

583
00:45:24.857 --> 00:45:25.990
Miriam!

584
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.146
Thanks.

585
00:45:34.055 --> 00:45:35.132
Ah, that's the right one.

586
00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:36.027
How is he?

587
00:45:38.421 --> 00:45:39.254
Who?

588
00:45:39.583 --> 00:45:41.352
The Kaffir. How is he?

589
00:45:41.352 --> 00:45:42.996
Dead, I hope.

590
00:45:49.148 --> 00:45:51.297
Just look at it. Both lights.

591
00:45:51.819 --> 00:45:52.737
That should fit.

592
00:45:52.737 --> 00:45:53.466
You reckon?

593
00:45:53.466 --> 00:45:54.709
Yes. Try it.

594
00:45:56.168 --> 00:45:58.064
Come on! Light it!

595
00:46:15.435 --> 00:46:16.023
Are you OK?

596
00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:17.337
I'm fine.

597
00:46:24.525 --> 00:46:25.854
Where are you?

598
00:46:27.704 --> 00:46:28.833
I can help.

599
00:46:32.506 --> 00:46:33.823
Let me help you.

600
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:38.763
I don't need your help!

601
00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:55.430
I don't need your help.

602
00:47:26.105 --> 00:47:27.356
Where were you?

603
00:47:31.402 --> 00:47:33.355
I thought I left the washing out.

604
00:47:49.675 --> 00:47:51.833
Your place is here with me.

605
00:47:52.773 --> 00:47:54.793
Not with those Kaffirs.

606
00:48:34.429 --> 00:48:36.185
Oh! You found them!

607
00:48:37.038 --> 00:48:38.596
Books, madam. You forgot them?

608
00:48:38.596 --> 00:48:40.582
Yes, until somebody reminded me.

609
00:49:06.164 --> 00:49:08.751
Robert, take this. Take it
to the post office.


610
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:27.862
Here you are.

611
00:49:28.482 --> 00:49:29.270
Good morning, Jacob.

612
00:49:29.481 --> 00:49:30.736
Good morning, Madeline.

613
00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:32.106
Warm out today, isn't it?

614
00:49:32.106 --> 00:49:33.680
You can say that again.

615
00:49:34.348 --> 00:49:36.537
Hey, boy. Get me some water!

616
00:49:38.778 --> 00:49:40.802
Go on! You understand
English, do you?


617
00:49:40.802 --> 00:49:42.021
There's a jug over there.

618
00:49:43.872 --> 00:49:46.608
Listen, I'm the employee here and

619
00:49:46.608 --> 00:49:50.184
I'll get you the water if you are
incapable of getting it yourself.


620
00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.640
What's the matter
with you, lady?


621
00:49:54.913 --> 00:49:56.529
That will be six pence
for the stamps.


622
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.662
All of us here are losing our
dignity as human beings in this place,


623
00:50:16.662 --> 00:50:17.817
aren't we?

624
00:50:17.817 --> 00:50:20.106
Some of us more quickly
than others.


625
00:50:20.106 --> 00:50:23.034
Oh, no. Don't you believe
that for a second.


626
00:50:23.034 --> 00:50:25.347
It's men like him
who lose the most.


627
00:50:26.634 --> 00:50:28.521
Perhaps...

628
00:50:30.299 --> 00:50:31.877
I've got a parcel here for you.

629
00:50:32.816 --> 00:50:34.774
Or rather
for the young miss Harjan.


630
00:50:35.461 --> 00:50:37.406
Here. There's no other post.

631
00:50:41.067 --> 00:50:42.784
There's no return address.

632
00:50:42.784 --> 00:50:45.815
No. Perhaps it's
from a secret paramour.


633
00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:53.583
I'd better get back.

634
00:50:54.308 --> 00:50:56.059
I'll see you soon.

635
00:50:57.108 --> 00:50:58.600
Jacob!

636
00:50:59.261 --> 00:51:01.105
Be sure that you do.

637
00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:15.470
This came for you today.

638
00:51:17.773 --> 00:51:18.901
Thank you.

639
00:51:20.206 --> 00:51:23.861
It's... It's not
my mother's handwriting.


640
00:51:32.278 --> 00:51:36.287
<i><b>"All the wild summer
was in her gaze"</b></i>


641
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.886
She's not gonna work
all the time!


642
00:51:46.886 --> 00:51:49.845
This is still so difficult,
because he's too young.


643
00:51:52.237 --> 00:51:53.498
What are you doing?

644
00:51:53.498 --> 00:51:54.968
It's the Alis.

645
00:51:54.968 --> 00:51:57.355
They've come
to give their reply.


646
00:51:58.711 --> 00:52:00.740
Even my mother must realise
it's going to be no.


647
00:52:04.827 --> 00:52:06.626
Won't you have some tea?

648
00:52:06.626 --> 00:52:08.478
Send that girl to me
at once!


649
00:52:09.268 --> 00:52:10.242
Who? Amina?

650
00:52:10.242 --> 00:52:11.201
Of course.

651
00:52:11.201 --> 00:52:13.573
She needs discipline now.

652
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:16.542
Send me the doctor.

653
00:52:16.542 --> 00:52:17.952
I'm dying.

654
00:52:18.386 --> 00:52:19.924
She'll be fine.

655
00:52:20.876 --> 00:52:22.809
Ma', just...

656
00:52:25.919 --> 00:52:27.479
Just take her some tea.

657
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:28.645
But she's dying.

658
00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:31.506
She's been claiming
an imminent death for 30 years.


659
00:52:31.932 --> 00:52:34.934
Please, just...
Take her some tea.


660
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:55.280
Ma'!

661
00:52:55.708 --> 00:52:57.242
Dinner is ready!

662
00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:06.413
Ma', your tea
must be ice cold.


663
00:53:10.524 --> 00:53:13.228
I don't have time to go driving
around the countryside


664
00:53:13.228 --> 00:53:15.229
for some old woman
we didn't even know.


665
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:18.091
That family don't mix
with any of us.


666
00:53:18.091 --> 00:53:20.507
Yet, when it suits them, they expect
all of us to just come running.


667
00:53:20.507 --> 00:53:21.974
They don't expect it.

668
00:53:21.974 --> 00:53:23.884
I don't owe
those people anything!


669
00:53:23.884 --> 00:53:25.235
Yes, you do.

670
00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:27.907
Amina Harjan
saved your sister.


671
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:31.443
After Farah betrayed her.

672
00:54:18.064 --> 00:54:20.104
Auntie, is Amina here?

673
00:54:20.104 --> 00:54:22.674
I'd like to offer
my condolences.


674
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.000
- She's in the next room.
- OK.


675
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:29.608
Please see
if she will join us.


676
00:54:52.484 --> 00:54:54.241
I'm reading your book.

677
00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:56.590
I'd forgotten I even
had them un-, until...


678
00:54:56.822 --> 00:54:58.400
I didn't know
you knew my parents.


679
00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.192
I don't.
We came to see you.


680
00:55:01.513 --> 00:55:02.905
The murderess?!

681
00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:05.278
Apparently my work
and my trousers


682
00:55:05.583 --> 00:55:07.458
caused the heart attack.

683
00:55:12.389 --> 00:55:15.057
I can't tell whether you approve
of my clothes or not.


684
00:55:21.168 --> 00:55:22.702
They're nice.

685
00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:26.617
It's a nice outfit.

686
00:55:27.768 --> 00:55:31.180
I mean that
you look nice in it.


687
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:33.731
So you prefer me
in traditional clothes?


688
00:55:33.731 --> 00:55:35.516
No...

689
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:37.998
You look very nice in this.

690
00:55:37.998 --> 00:55:40.330
But you don't look
like youself.


691
00:55:41.422 --> 00:55:43.503
I don't feel like myself!

692
00:55:45.056 --> 00:55:47.568
But I have to
please a person who,


693
00:55:47.988 --> 00:55:51.664
God rest her soul, is not
even able to see me.


694
00:55:55.958 --> 00:55:58.614
It sounds silly
when you put it like that.


695
00:55:58.614 --> 00:56:00.616
It is silly.

696
00:56:00.616 --> 00:56:02.840
But no one else
seems to think so.


697
00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:08.523
Does it matter
what people think?


698
00:56:10.083 --> 00:56:12.148
Doesn't it?

699
00:56:12.587 --> 00:56:14.415
Why did you get married?

700
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.002
Did you fall in love and

701
00:56:16.002 --> 00:56:18.134
know you wanted to be with him

702
00:56:18.134 --> 00:56:20.279
for the rest of your life?

703
00:56:20.486 --> 00:56:21.236
No.

704
00:56:23.381 --> 00:56:25.638
He saw me a few times and...

705
00:56:26.754 --> 00:56:28.361
proposed and...

706
00:56:28.667 --> 00:56:30.310
my family accepted.

707
00:56:30.707 --> 00:56:32.509
And that's what you want
to hear, isn't it?


708
00:56:32.733 --> 00:56:34.856
That it never occured
to me to question it.


709
00:56:35.146 --> 00:56:37.116
It occurs to me
to question it.


710
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.467
I know.

711
00:56:44.541 --> 00:56:46.836
What happened to your face?

712
00:56:47.122 --> 00:56:48.704
Nothing.

713
00:56:55.582 --> 00:56:58.117
Your mother wants
to see you downstairs.


714
00:56:58.117 --> 00:57:00.132
My husband wants
to see you too.


715
00:57:00.132 --> 00:57:01.349
To thank you.

716
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:02.378
For what?

717
00:57:02.378 --> 00:57:04.363
For Rehmat.

718
00:57:04.363 --> 00:57:06.274
Anyone would've done
the same.


719
00:57:06.274 --> 00:57:07.718
I didn't.

720
00:57:08.422 --> 00:57:10.166
Did they hurt you?

721
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.433
The police?

722
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.539
They were taking
my children away.


723
00:57:16.221 --> 00:57:18.202
Then you did the right thing.

724
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.459
Come.

725
00:57:23.077 --> 00:57:25.418
I want to change back
into my own clothes.


726
00:57:40.405 --> 00:57:42.638
Why should you take that risk?

727
00:57:43.131 --> 00:57:44.968
Because I hate apartheid.

728
00:57:46.781 --> 00:57:49.651
Because I hate aggressive policemen.

729
00:57:49.998 --> 00:57:52.337
I wish I could be
more like you.


730
00:58:03.252 --> 00:58:07.510
Be careful what
you wish for...


731
00:58:07.732 --> 00:58:08.814
...Miriam.

732
00:58:22.218 --> 00:58:23.435
Jacob?

733
00:58:23.908 --> 00:58:25.182
I have an idea.

734
00:58:25.997 --> 00:58:27.860
You haven't had a bad one yet.

735
00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.299
What is it?

736
00:58:30.352 --> 00:58:31.960
Indian food.

737
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.650
All sorts of things:
samosas, biryanis...


738
00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:37.585
OK...

739
00:58:38.342 --> 00:58:39.980
But you know
our girls don't know


740
00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.462
the first thing about
making a proper Indian curry.


741
00:58:43.415 --> 00:58:45.381
So who's gonna
do the cooking?


742
00:58:45.932 --> 00:58:47.096
Don't worry.

743
00:58:47.428 --> 00:58:49.324
I've already thought of that.

744
00:59:19.421 --> 00:59:21.280
Where you just passing through?

745
00:59:22.653 --> 00:59:25.062
No offence to you... there down...
but I...


746
00:59:25.377 --> 00:59:26.476
It's OK...

747
00:59:26.476 --> 00:59:29.108
...but I don't think anybody
just passes through.


748
00:59:29.414 --> 00:59:30.948
I came to see you.

749
00:59:31.427 --> 00:59:34.040
Will you have some tea?
A cold drink?


750
00:59:34.983 --> 00:59:36.594
I want to talk to you.

751
00:59:36.594 --> 00:59:38.237
About the café.

752
00:59:38.716 --> 00:59:40.226
We're thinking about something
new. Indian food.


753
00:59:40.226 --> 00:59:41.901
Maybe a few days a week.

754
00:59:41.901 --> 00:59:43.622
It's a good idea.

755
00:59:45.122 --> 00:59:47.043
I want you to cook
for the café.


756
00:59:47.043 --> 00:59:48.280
Me?

757
00:59:52.611 --> 00:59:54.464
You haven't even
had my cooking.


758
00:59:54.464 --> 00:59:56.035
I ate here,
remember?


759
00:59:56.035 --> 00:59:57.737
Potato curry and daal.

760
01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.123
Besides, I couldn't do it.

761
01:00:07.553 --> 01:00:08.800
Why not?

762
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.064
Because I have to
take care of the shop.


763
01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:14.903
We'd pay you well.

764
01:00:17.049 --> 01:00:18.280
My children.

765
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:22.589
OK, then we'll make it one morning
a week to start with.


766
01:00:26.249 --> 01:00:27.819
My husband wouldn't like it.

767
01:00:27.819 --> 01:00:31.225
I'm offering the job to you,
not your husband.


768
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.465
You surprise me.

769
01:00:36.255 --> 01:00:38.521
I thought you had
a fearless streak.


770
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:45.470
How would you know whether
I have a fearless streak or not?


771
01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:49.797
Wasn't it you who went out
in the middle of the night


772
01:00:49.797 --> 01:00:52.588
to help an African
who was hit by a car?


773
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.807
How could you know?

774
01:00:56.576 --> 01:00:59.363
There were only two people:
myself and my husband.


775
01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:03.381
Three.

776
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.727
I know this government
would like us to think that


777
01:01:05.727 --> 01:01:07.129
they're savages,

778
01:01:07.129 --> 01:01:09.871
but Africans can speak
as well as we can.


779
01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:25.510
Has it been busy?

780
01:01:25.965 --> 01:01:26.715
No.

781
01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:30.519
I came to see if Miriam
would cook for the cafe.


782
01:01:32.584 --> 01:01:34.175
What did you say?

783
01:01:34.175 --> 01:01:38.752
I said that I have to
mind the shop and the children.


784
01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:42.086
My wife doesn't need to work.

785
01:01:42.486 --> 01:01:44.513
Look, I'm sorry it's not a
question of need...


786
01:01:44.513 --> 01:01:45.263
No!

787
01:01:48.519 --> 01:01:50.901
My wife doesn't know
how to drive.


788
01:01:50.901 --> 01:01:53.243
I've told her time and again
to take lessons,


789
01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:54.923
but she doesn't want to.

790
01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:56.463
If only she had...

791
01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.497
Oh, but I teach
driving myself.


792
01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.953
Miriam, if you want me to come
for a couple of hours a week,


793
01:02:03.426 --> 01:02:05.435
I'd be happy to come teach you.

794
01:02:05.731 --> 01:02:07.508
Thank you. Yes, 
I'd like that.

795
01:02:08.487 --> 01:02:12.149
My husband has been telling
me I should learn


796
01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:14.647
how to drive for some time now.

797
01:02:15.582 --> 01:02:18.379
Good, then it's settled.

798
01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:21.575
I'll see you next week.

799
01:02:39.113 --> 01:02:40.459
Why did you do that?

800
01:02:40.459 --> 01:02:42.008
You know eggs are expensive.

801
01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:45.023
You have a long day
in Cape Town.


802
01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.472
I may be staying the night.

803
01:03:03.265 --> 01:03:04.999
You're early...

804
01:03:07.963 --> 01:03:09.572
Very early.

805
01:03:10.183 --> 01:03:11.551
What happened?

806
01:03:12.692 --> 01:03:14.032
The market's closed.

807
01:03:14.032 --> 01:03:15.430
Closed?

808
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:16.727
Why closed?

809
01:03:17.764 --> 01:03:19.637
Day of action
by the blacks.


810
01:03:20.947 --> 01:03:22.353
Bloody blacks.

811
01:04:31.774 --> 01:04:34.782
Farah? Farah?

812
01:04:34.782 --> 01:04:37.867
Bhai,
everything OK?


813
01:04:37.867 --> 01:04:38.912
My God!

814
01:04:38.912 --> 01:04:40.535
Bhai...

815
01:04:41.187 --> 01:04:43.583
Were you just going to
surprise us like this?


816
01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.323
How good to see you!

817
01:04:45.323 --> 01:04:47.669
How did you know
Sadru was back?


818
01:04:48.133 --> 01:04:50.517
I... I've finished
early today...


819
01:04:50.819 --> 01:04:54.142
So I thought I'd stop in
to say hello.


820
01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:55.988
I also finished early today...

821
01:04:55.988 --> 01:04:57.188
The demonstration...

822
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:02.017
Family OK?

823
01:05:17.939 --> 01:05:19.144
Are you ready for me?

824
01:05:19.144 --> 01:05:21.426
Who else is going to
teach me how to drive?


825
01:05:57.094 --> 01:05:59.879
OK, let's start
with the pedals first.


826
01:06:00.325 --> 01:06:03.003
This is
the gas pedal - the accelerator,


827
01:06:03.429 --> 01:06:05.143
and this is the...
- Break.


828
01:06:05.431 --> 01:06:07.834
- Right, and this is the...
- Clutch.


829
01:06:09.235 --> 01:06:10.585
Do you know
how to drive?


830
01:06:10.585 --> 01:06:13.037
No. Why would I ask for lessons
if I knew how to drive?


831
01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:14.412
I don't know.

832
01:06:14.412 --> 01:06:16.334
Maybe you wanted to see me.

833
01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.170
I don't know how to drive.

834
01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:25.492
But my husband
showed me all the pedals


835
01:06:25.492 --> 01:06:28.372
once when he tried
to teach me how to learn.


836
01:06:28.372 --> 01:06:32.101
There's only three,
so it's not difficult.


837
01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:35.434
Do you know
the gears too?


838
01:06:38.783 --> 01:06:39.533
No.

839
01:06:40.808 --> 01:06:42.029
I'll show you.

840
01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:49.214
Is madam inside?

841
01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.067
No, she's in the
driving lesson, sir.


842
01:06:53.517 --> 01:06:56.046
There you are. See?

843
01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.215
Did he see us?

844
01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:35.556
No.

845
01:07:37.582 --> 01:07:39.273
We were having
a driving lesson.


846
01:07:39.675 --> 01:07:41.299
I'm not finished yet.

847
01:07:42.927 --> 01:07:44.456
Get out of the truck.

848
01:07:48.163 --> 01:07:50.339
Miriam, we'll finish
another time.


849
01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.030
How was your day?

850
01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:00.203
What?

851
01:08:00.203 --> 01:08:01.668
How was your day?

852
01:08:01.668 --> 01:08:02.786
Not good.

853
01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:04.627
Sorry to hear that.

854
01:08:04.627 --> 01:08:06.269
But things could get better.

855
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:22.188
I want to talk to you.

856
01:08:24.075 --> 01:08:25.507
Where's Robert?

857
01:08:25.938 --> 01:08:27.294
Inside probably.

858
01:08:27.787 --> 01:08:29.724
I was angry
with him earlier.


859
01:08:30.803 --> 01:08:33.302
Why are you angry
with all of us?


860
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.311
I should be angry with you.

861
01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.154
It's finished.

862
01:08:43.744 --> 01:08:45.738
I won't be seeing her anymore.

863
01:08:47.346 --> 01:08:49.300
Why did you do it, Omar?

864
01:08:52.144 --> 01:08:54.193
I don't know.

865
01:08:57.385 --> 01:08:58.801
There's mummy!

866
01:08:59.354 --> 01:09:00.878
I'll race you!

867
01:09:02.562 --> 01:09:04.170
You hurt me.

868
01:09:04.658 --> 01:09:06.341
Mummy, mummy!

869
01:09:08.249 --> 01:09:09.898
Come, come, come!

870
01:09:10.153 --> 01:09:11.248
Go, go, go, go, go!

871
01:09:18.373 --> 01:09:24.030
<i>"It won't be a stylish marriage,
We can't afford a carriage..."</i>


872
01:09:24.858 --> 01:09:27.352
I've asked Madeline
to have dinner with me.


873
01:09:28.724 --> 01:09:30.503
She accepted.

874
01:09:32.155 --> 01:09:33.699
Do you know
what you're doing?


875
01:09:33.699 --> 01:09:35.102
I believe I do, yes.

876
01:09:35.102 --> 01:09:37.296
Where will you take her
for dinner?


877
01:09:40.763 --> 01:09:43.760
I'm not fit to take her anywhere,
am I?


878
01:09:44.006 --> 01:09:46.118
Only good enough to serve
her a plate of food


879
01:09:46.118 --> 01:09:48.655
but not to sit
and eat with her.


880
01:09:52.707 --> 01:09:54.330
You could bring her here.

881
01:09:56.978 --> 01:09:58.768
I'll think of something.

882
01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:06.371
I have lived my entire life
in this place by their rules.


883
01:10:06.905 --> 01:10:10.503
I do not want to end my life
alone because of them.


884
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:12.654
I know.

885
01:10:13.464 --> 01:10:15.109
I know but

886
01:10:15.109 --> 01:10:18.299
lately I've been wondering
whether it's worth


887
01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:20.843
going after certain people....

888
01:10:21.101 --> 01:10:23.470
...no matter how strongly
you feel about them.


889
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:25.248
You more than anyone

890
01:10:26.085 --> 01:10:29.064
has taught me
that it is worth it.


891
01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:33.454
Don't start
changing now, Amina.


892
01:10:51.474 --> 01:10:52.895
Hello.

893
01:10:54.425 --> 01:10:55.361
Hello, Robert.

894
01:10:55.361 --> 01:10:56.664
Miss.

895
01:10:56.664 --> 01:10:58.465
Are you ready?

896
01:11:11.826 --> 01:11:13.182
Robert?

897
01:11:14.094 --> 01:11:16.040
Take care of the shop please.

898
01:11:28.557 --> 01:11:31.483
You didn't come to give me
a driving lesson,


899
01:11:33.154 --> 01:11:34.992
did you?

900
01:11:38.388 --> 01:11:40.250
Why did you come?

901
01:11:52.335 --> 01:11:54.262
I can't.

902
01:11:56.425 --> 01:11:58.407
I'm married.

903
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.820
And you're a woman.

904
01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.749
Those are not good reasons.

905
01:12:05.705 --> 01:12:08.978
They are my reasons and
they matter to me.


906
01:12:11.924 --> 01:12:13.894
Don't you care for me?

907
01:12:21.548 --> 01:12:23.668
Of course I care for you.

908
01:12:24.067 --> 01:12:25.544
Amina, please...

909
01:12:25.544 --> 01:12:27.489
Miriam.

910
01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:31.044
What am I doing to you?

911
01:12:34.013 --> 01:12:35.790
What am I doing to you?

912
01:12:38.111 --> 01:12:40.829
Every time I look at you

913
01:12:42.602 --> 01:12:45.076
I want you to stay...

914
01:12:46.444 --> 01:12:48.774
...forever.

915
01:13:05.805 --> 01:13:07.971
Will you do something for me?

916
01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.455
Close your eyes.

917
01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:15.732
You can trust me.

918
01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:18.829
I'm not afraid of you.

919
01:13:27.139 --> 01:13:28.878
Will you just imagine,

920
01:13:28.878 --> 01:13:31.012
just for now,

921
01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:35.853
just for
brief moments,


922
01:13:37.174 --> 01:13:41.016
that nothing exists

923
01:13:41.287 --> 01:13:43.287
except for you and me?

924
01:14:12.033 --> 01:14:13.729
You need to go to her.

925
01:14:16.265 --> 01:14:17.015
No.

926
01:14:22.293 --> 01:14:24.064
What happens now?

927
01:14:27.543 --> 01:14:29.795
Do these driving lessons
just continue?


928
01:14:37.152 --> 01:14:38.708
Come away with me!

929
01:14:39.419 --> 01:14:42.934
I have three children,
who I'll never leave.


930
01:14:42.934 --> 01:14:45.583
I would never ask you
to leave the children.


931
01:14:45.887 --> 01:14:47.415
We could...

932
01:14:47.798 --> 01:14:49.027
We could move.

933
01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:52.733
We could move away from him, Miriam,
and I will look after you and the children.


934
01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:56.984
Amina, please...

935
01:14:56.984 --> 01:14:58.570
Miriam, I know...

936
01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:01.160
I know that you think I don't know
what I'm talking about,


937
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:04.959
but I've lived this way, Miriam,
I've lived my own way my whole life,


938
01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:06.229
and it can be done!

939
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:07.465
- Amina!
- It can be done, Miriam.


940
01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:08.681
Amina...

941
01:15:11.119 --> 01:15:14.340
Not for me.

942
01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:25.880
Ah, Jacob!

943
01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.058
Do you need a hand?

944
01:16:28.058 --> 01:16:30.180
If you wouldn't mind. I'm
struggling with this lock.


945
01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.790
Here, let me do it.

946
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:36.908
Hello.

947
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:38.960
Hello?

948
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.323
Police here, ma'am.

949
01:16:40.323 --> 01:16:42.053
Post-mistress here, sir.

950
01:16:42.483 --> 01:16:43.701
Are you alright?

951
01:16:43.701 --> 01:16:46.070
I was driving by
and I saw the door ajar.


952
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:48.501
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
Just locking up.


953
01:16:48.888 --> 01:16:49.906
Sorry to trouble you.

954
01:16:50.129 --> 01:16:51.535
No trouble.

955
01:16:55.565 --> 01:16:57.064
Who's there?

956
01:16:59.986 --> 01:17:00.863
This is Jacob.

957
01:17:00.863 --> 01:17:03.132
The section where you are standing
is for whites only.


958
01:17:03.132 --> 01:17:04.889
He was just helping me lock up.

959
01:17:04.889 --> 01:17:06.113
He shouldn't be there.

960
01:17:06.113 --> 01:17:07.788
Who is he anyway?

961
01:17:08.547 --> 01:17:10.547
He's my driver.

962
01:17:19.306 --> 01:17:21.482
Why doesn't your driver
keep the keys?


963
01:17:21.482 --> 01:17:23.417
Coz I prefer
to keep them myself.


964
01:17:23.417 --> 01:17:24.790
Yeah, I know what you mean...

965
01:17:25.196 --> 01:17:26.769
Better to be safe than sorry.

966
01:17:26.769 --> 01:17:28.307
Quite...

967
01:17:56.995 --> 01:17:59.783
I thought I told you
not to disturb me?!!


968
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.691
Yes, but that was when you
were six years old, no?


969
01:18:07.168 --> 01:18:08.481
Dad...

970
01:18:09.450 --> 01:18:11.468
I'm sorry,
I thought that...


971
01:18:12.129 --> 01:18:15.996
You come! I thought that you were
Doris or one of the girls.


972
01:18:17.642 --> 01:18:18.912
Just me.

973
01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:27.936
Can I get you something to eat?

974
01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:29.157
Some tea?

975
01:18:29.157 --> 01:18:31.235
No, no, I'm fine.

976
01:18:32.888 --> 01:18:36.689
No, we just... we haven't heard
from you for 3 weeks and your...


977
01:18:37.769 --> 01:18:40.187
so your mother's worried
and I just came to check...


978
01:18:40.187 --> 01:18:42.097
to see you're OK.

979
01:18:44.757 --> 01:18:46.142
I'm fine.

980
01:18:46.734 --> 01:18:47.814
Good.

981
01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:53.269
Things have been...
um...


982
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:57.269
It's hard to explain.

983
01:18:57.269 --> 01:18:58.641
No need.

984
01:19:00.596 --> 01:19:02.747
You see, people like to make sure
your mother and I


985
01:19:02.747 --> 01:19:05.589
know everything that is
happening with you.


986
01:19:06.983 --> 01:19:09.289
They wouldn't like us
to miss out.


987
01:19:11.808 --> 01:19:14.072
Only this time people are...

988
01:19:15.347 --> 01:19:18.615
Amina, people are talking
about her, not just you.


989
01:19:20.074 --> 01:19:21.448
They know her as well.

990
01:19:21.448 --> 01:19:23.072
They have no right.

991
01:19:23.339 --> 01:19:26.480
It's only because she's friends with me
that they make any assumptions.


992
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:30.021
Don't people have
anything better to do?!


993
01:19:30.257 --> 01:19:31.894
No, they don't.

994
01:19:33.658 --> 01:19:35.430
That's why I try
to avoid them.


995
01:20:02.386 --> 01:20:04.084
Jacob,

996
01:20:04.084 --> 01:20:06.716
I'm so terribly sorry about
what happened.


997
01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:10.460
I'm ashamed to say that I was
afraid of that young policeman,


998
01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:13.409
and what he might do to you
if he suspected...


999
01:20:13.409 --> 01:20:15.090
It's alright.

1000
01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:18.147
Probably they'd thrown me
in jail if they'd guessed.


1001
01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.401
Jacob, come inside.

1002
01:20:20.603 --> 01:20:22.303
I'll make us some supper.

1003
01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.313
I can't.

1004
01:20:28.063 --> 01:20:31.054
I hope you understand.

1005
01:20:32.985 --> 01:20:35.397
Yes, I understand.

1006
01:20:37.142 --> 01:20:38.605
I am sorry.

1007
01:20:41.959 --> 01:20:44.484
- I-I-I want to drive you home.
- No.


1008
01:20:49.114 --> 01:20:50.973
Goodbye, Madeline.

1009
01:20:57.059 --> 01:20:58.898
Goodbye, Jacob.

1010
01:21:00.073 --> 01:21:02.013
Goodbye.

1011
01:21:21.247 --> 01:21:22.678
So, you're running away?

1012
01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:26.263
No, I just need some time, I just need
some time away to think, dad.


1013
01:21:32.586 --> 01:21:33.787
Do you need money?

1014
01:21:33.787 --> 01:21:34.537
No.

1015
01:21:35.897 --> 01:21:37.627
Thank you.

1016
01:21:42.179 --> 01:21:43.846
You shouldn't go.

1017
01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.996
How will she know
where to find you?!


1018
01:22:02.809 --> 01:22:04.446
What a day!

1019
01:22:08.789 --> 01:22:11.058
Did you have
your driving lesson today?


1020
01:22:11.058 --> 01:22:11.808
No.

1021
01:22:14.034 --> 01:22:15.412
Good.

1022
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.653
That's over then.

1023
01:22:17.653 --> 01:22:18.403
No.

1024
01:22:19.671 --> 01:22:23.105
I have to learn how to drive
if I'm going to work.


1025
01:22:23.589 --> 01:22:25.342
You work here.

1026
01:22:26.834 --> 01:22:29.425
And I will still work here.

1027
01:22:29.845 --> 01:22:33.341
And I will work at the cafe
for two mornings a week.


1028
01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.647
You don't need to work.

1029
01:22:38.528 --> 01:22:40.065
I do.

1030
01:22:40.284 --> 01:22:43.348
It's just for two mornings,
just let me learn how to drive.


1031
01:22:43.348 --> 01:22:46.057
You will not be my wife
and work!


1032
01:22:47.006 --> 01:22:49.107
Do you wanna divorce me?

1033
01:22:49.107 --> 01:22:51.104
What about the children?

1034
01:22:52.276 --> 01:22:53.837
What is it, Omar?

1035
01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:56.354
Tell me
what you're thinking.


1036
01:23:03.392 --> 01:23:04.802
Mummy!

1037
01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.221
It's OK.

1038
01:23:10.071 --> 01:23:13.970
It's alright, my love. Everything's OK.
Go back to sleep.


1039
01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:16.740
It's alright.

1040
01:23:32.779 --> 01:23:35.061
I don't like it.

1041
01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.810
If I don't like it,
that should be enough.


1042
01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:43.658
It's not enough.

1043
01:23:44.899 --> 01:23:47.126
It never has been.

1044
01:23:48.478 --> 01:23:51.629
I just didn't know
what to tell you until now.


1045
01:23:55.633 --> 01:23:56.383
No!

1046
01:23:57.062 --> 01:23:59.698
You'll have to find a better way
of speaking to me.


1047
01:24:11.354 --> 01:24:13.306
Not again!

1048
01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.695
I may still need some lessons.

1049
01:24:39.787 --> 01:24:42.101
You drove all the way
from Delhof?!


1050
01:24:42.348 --> 01:24:44.611
Do you still have
that vacancy?


1051
01:24:47.673 --> 01:24:49.472
Two days a week?

1052
01:24:59.465 --> 01:25:03.568
If it works out,
even more...


1053
01:25:14.855 --> 01:25:16.303
Come on then.

1054
01:25:19.872 --> 01:25:21.591
I'm Miriam.
