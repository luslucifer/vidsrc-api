1
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.800
We gotta jack it up. 
We need help here.

2
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.500
Hey, we got a flat tire in the back now.
They gotta get that unloaded.


3
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.600
Slim, get over there.
I don't need you working on the tarp.


4
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.300
I got it, I got it! Pull it down.
Hook it at the bottom.


5
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.600
Just get out of the way. Come on.

6
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.600
Hey, guys, get out of the truck.
We need a hand out here. Hurry up.


7
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.400
Come on, they got
a flat tire down there.

8
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.500
Let's go, let's go. We gotta get down there.
The animals are getting spooked.


9
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.900
Hurry up. Hurry, now.
We've gotta get it unloaded.


10
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.300
Don't worry about it. 
Just let it go.

11
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.300
No, no. No, five of them. Go.
Don't worry about that.


12
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.500
Don't let the zebras run. 
Stay with them.

13
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.100
- Both of you, come here.
- Everything's off.


14
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.600
- No, no, no.
- All right, it's good. It's good.


15
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.400
We'll load them up
as soon as the tire's on.


16
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.900
Load them back on!
Don't forget anything!


17
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.600
- Come on. There you go.
- Go. Go.


18
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.900
- Let's go.
- We've got it.


19
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600
- We got everything?
- We've got it all.


20
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.800
What the...? Hey. Hey, there.

21
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.400
Hey, boy, just calm down.
It's all right. It's all right.


22
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.000
There we go. There you go.

23
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.200
It's all right.

24
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.800
It's all right. There you go.

25
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200
- All right.
- You weren't kidding.


26
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.700
Can we keep him, Daddy?
Can we, please?


27
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.100
I don't know, it's...

28
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.300
You know, he's probably got all kinds
of special needs. We should...


29
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.200
- We should probably call the zoo and...
- No.


30
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.600
No zoos. You know I don't like the idea
of animals in cages.


31
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
Honey, neither do I,
but let's just see what we got here.


32
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.000
Let's... I gotta think about this.

33
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.500
Well, first things first. Let's get him
some blankets and warm milk.


34
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.900
Okay, don't get too carried away.

35
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.200
- Stop waking me up.
- What's in the basket?


36
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.700
Hey, Tucker. Did you see that?

37
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.700
You seen one funny-Iooking horse,
you seen them all.


38
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.100
Oh, come on.
Get out there and say hello.


39
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.700
- Wake me up when he leaves.
- You know what, I'll do it myself.


40
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.400
That's the weirdest-Iooking horse
I've ever seen.


41
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.300
Oh, he's cute. Tucker, come out here
and meet our guest.


42
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.600
I'm coming. I swear, Franny,
the funnier-Iooking the animal...


43
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.300
...the more you wanna keep it.
- Kept you, didn't I?


44
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.700
Well, subdivide me and Kentucky-fry me.

45
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.100
You know what, Tucker,
you cut those bangs...


46
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.000
...you and him could be cousins.
- Bad hair.


47
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.100
- Just thinking out loud. Thinking out loud.
- Question time.


48
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.100
- What exactly are you?
- Good question.


49
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.000
- I don't know.
- Okay, we can rule out genius.


50
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.200
Don't make me chew open a can
of pony whup.


51
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.500
Save the sweet talk for later.

52
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.700
Don't pay any attention to him.
Listen, he's all whinny and no bite.


53
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.200
I'm Franny, this is Reggie,
and Mr. Sensitive here is Tucker.


54
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.700
And that old goat
there is an old goat.

55
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800
It's the Chief.

56
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.200
- You used to be so nice.
- Yeah, I know, but I got over it.


57
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.500
Why do you have to be
such a horse's...?


58
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.200
Well, let's just get you dried off first,
all right?


59
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.600
He's got real strong legs.

60
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.900
He's quite the little athlete.

61
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.600
Hey, buddy.

62
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.300
Why don't you grab the milk
and see if he'll come to you.


63
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.600
Come here, boy. Come on.

64
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.200
Come on. Come on. 
There you are.

65
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.400
Come on, boy.

66
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.200
Come on.

67
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.300
Attaboy.

68
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.100
- Welcome to your new home, Stripes.
- Stripes?


69
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.100
Well, "Spot" doesn't work, now, does it?

70
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.700
You like that name, don't you?

71
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.600
Stripes.

72
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.900
Well, I'll take that as a yes.

73
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.900
Good morning, Walsh Farm!

74
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.600
Well, I know it's not glamorous,
but it's a living.


75
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.000
Keeps my head on my shoulders, which
is more than I can say for my cousins.


76
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.900
Simmer down there, Lightning.

77
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.900
Hey, hey, slow down. Boy, oh, boy.

78
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.900
Kids these days, no control.
Now, back in my day...


79
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.400
Oh, here we go again with
the ancient-history lesson. Enough.


80
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.100
Now we're in for it.

81
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.800
<i>And the horses are entering</i>
<i>the starting gates.</i>


82
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.400
Oh, what is that?

83
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.100
That is the only reason
for a horse to live, kid.


84
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.500
It's called a racetrack.

85
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.900
Oh, there's more to life
than running around in a circle.


86
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.800
Well, maybe to you. It's like this:
Humans race, horses race.


87
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.300
There was even a <i>Chicken Run</i>, but there's
never been a goat race. Ever, ever, ever.


88
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.600
Get the picture, Franny?

89
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.600
- Could I race?
- It's complicated.


90
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.100
It takes a lot of work
to become a racehorse.


91
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.300
- What's a racehorse?
- They're the greatest.


92
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.500
Once a year, there's a big race
to see who's the best.


93
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.100
By the way, the horses that won every year
were the ones we trained.


94
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.500
- Why did you quit?
- lxnay on the other-may.


95
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.800
Say what you mean.
We haven't spoken Latin since the pigs left.


96
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.100
Oh, all right.

97
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.100
A few years ago, the girl's mother
had an accident.


98
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.400
Yeah. Her horse stumbled
and neither one of them could be saved.


99
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.000
- The Chief couldn't bear to train after that.
- And neither did we.


100
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.800
Hey, look, they're ready to go.

101
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.200
- How come none of them have stripes?
- You take this one.


102
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.700
Thanks.

103
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.700
Just unlucky, I guess.

104
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.800
<i>And they're off. 
Flash of Thunder's...</i>

105
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.200
Look at them. Look at them run.
Watch me, I'm a racehorse.


106
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.800
Well, would you look at him?
He loves to run. It's in his heart.


107
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.100
- But that's not enough.
- You could train him.


108
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.900
- Then it would be enough.
- Let me tell you something.


109
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.500
The legs are too short, the head's too big.
He's got as much chance to race as me.


110
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.300
Besides, I have got better things to do.

111
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.500
- Oh, go fix your hair.
- I heard that.


112
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.900
Watch me, I'm in the big race.

113
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.500
Excuse me. Racehorse coming through.

114
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.200
Whoa, look at that.

115
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.800
- Come on.
- Dude, I'm right with you.


116
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.100
Whoa, nice mohawk.

117
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.700
That's funny. Mohawk.

118
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.500
- What's a mohawk?
- Shut up, you idiot.


119
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.900
- You guys train to race?
- Yeah, you want a taste?


120
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.500
- Ready, set, go. Catch me if you can.
- Hey, I wasn't ready.


121
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.600
Come on, you slowpoke! Yeah!

122
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:46.000
- I'm not even in second gear yet.
- Yeah, he's not even in second gear yet.


123
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.400
Last one to the fence is a donkey.

124
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.200
- Dude, it's your dad.
- Great.


125
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.300
Son. Stay away from that fence.

126
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.700
Come on, Dad.
We were just having some fun.


127
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.000
Fun is overrated.

128
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.100
If you're going to be a champion,
I suggest you start acting like one.


129
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.400
- Oh, your dad scares me, dude.
- Not me.


130
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.200
- Pride! Ruffshodd!
- Coming, Father.


131
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.200
Yeah, coming, Mr. 
Sir Trenton, sir.

132
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.900
I don't understand.
Why won't he let them play with me?


133
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:30.100
You're just different.
And for some horses, different is scary.


134
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.700
Come on, he's never late.

135
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.500
I'm all ready to go. Where is he?

136
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.300
Oh, here he comes.

137
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.400
Bring it on. Show me what you got.

138
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.300
Here we go.

139
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.600
Better luck tomorrow!

140
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Dang! I had him today.

141
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.500
- She's just not right today, Mr. Cooper.
- Yep.


142
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.300
- Better give her a break.
- Okay.


143
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.400
You call that jumping?
Looked like she was having a seizure.


144
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.800
Sorry, Miss Dalrymple.
She seemed a bit shy on the high jump...


145
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.000
...so I thought I'd take it easy.
- Of course you did.


146
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But, you know, the thing is,
I don't pay you to take it easy.


147
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.100
I pay you to train.

148
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.500
You can only push a horse so hard.

149
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.900
Cooper, Cooper, Cooper.
Why must you be so tedious?


150
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.000
Okay, here's the deal.

151
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.300
Now, as long as I am signing your checks,
you will push her as hard as I tell you to.


152
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.500
Don't you have a board meeting
at the track to get to?


153
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.300
As a matter of fact, I do.

154
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.900
Yo, yo, Pride. Check out the new filly.
What a mane.


155
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.200
Look at those flanks.

156
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.200
Watch. She's gonna come straight for me.
Do I have anything in my teeth?


157
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.900
You always have something
in your teeth, Ruffshodd.


158
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.600
- Hey, where's she going?
- Excuse me.


159
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.100
- Would you care to join me for a drink?
- A drink. Good call.


160
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.100
No.

161
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.300
Talk to the tail, boys.

162
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.300
Did you ever consider going around
that tree instead of through it?


163
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.900
Yeah, well, usually it moves
out of my way.


164
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.500
I've never heard of a tree doing that.

165
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.800
You don't know the trees here.
Are you new?


166
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.100
- Just got here. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Stripes.


167
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.300
You don't say?

168
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.300
- Are you a racehorse?
- No, I'm a jumper.


169
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.500
I've actually competed
all around the world.


170
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.900
Well, I'm a racehorse.
I'm training to be in the big race.


171
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.700
By racing the mailman?

172
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.100
Well, the other horses
don't wanna race me.


173
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.800
- I'm just way too fast for them.
- He's not a racer.


174
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.200
Oh, not them again.

175
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.800
They say his dad's a horse
and his mom's a fence.


176
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.200
Real funny, guys.

177
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.300
I've gotta go, I'm sorry.
I'll see you around, Stripes?


178
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.100
- Later.
- So, Stripey, how's it going?


179
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.700
- You still racing the mailman?
- Oh, the mailman wasn't racing him.


180
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.500
- He was running away from him.
- I'll race you any time you want.


181
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.800
- Well, unfortunately I don't race nobodies.
- Yeah, he don't race nobodies.


182
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.600
- Figures. All talk and no action.
- Well, this is disappointing.


183
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.900
- Oh, it's my dad.
- Listen, you.


184
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.800
I want you to stop bothering my son.
And you can tell Tucker I said that.


185
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:58.000
Trenton's Pride is a champion
with a real future. And you, well...


186
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.700
You have your place.

187
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.100
- Father, l...
- You and I will talk later.


188
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.100
Mr. Sir Trenton, sir, we been trying
to get this guy to stop bothering us...


189
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.500
...but he just won't stop...
- Ruffshodd.


190
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.500
...bothering us.
- Shut up, you idiot.


191
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.100
Yes, Mr. Sir Trenton, sir.

192
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.400
And may I say,
your coat is very shiny today.


193
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.300
There's a place where we can settle this.
No humans. No rules.


194
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.100
Where and when?

195
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.300
- Welcome to the Blue Moon Races.
- Yeah!


196
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.000
- It's him.
- Be quiet. Be quiet.


197
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.300
Tonight's first contestant
is 10-0 and good to go.


198
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.200
He is the baddest pony on the prairie.

199
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.600
Give it up for Trenton's Pride.

200
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.800
Step right up, if you're horse enough.

201
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.600
- Not me, no way.
- Who's feeling their oats?


202
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.300
- Nobody can beat him.
- No way. He's too tough.


203
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.400
I'll take him on.

204
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.200
Laugh it up. Just wait and see.

205
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.800
- Hey, Sandy.
- Hi, Stripes.


206
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.400
Well, well.
I'm surprised you showed up.


207
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.700
You wanna talk or race?

208
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.700
- That coat is simply dreadful.
- Well, it's slimming, though. Right?


209
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.700
- Oh, you're gonna wish you stayed home.
- You're gonna wish I stayed home too.


210
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.100
After I kick your butt.

211
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.400
And now, let's get ready to...

212
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.000
...race!

213
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.600
Up to that heap, around it
and back to here.


214
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.300
I am going to make you look so bad
in front of your girlfriend.


215
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.400
- Send him home, Pride.
- Show him who's boss.


216
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.500
You got guts, kid.

217
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.400
Come on, Pride.
You show him who's in charge.


218
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.200
Let's go!

219
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.800
Come on, Stripey, try and keep up.
See you, loser.


220
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.600
Just giving you a head start.
You're gonna need it.


221
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.200
Come on, Pride, is that all you got?

222
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.400
I'm not even breaking a sweat yet.

223
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.200
Good thing your daddy's not here
to see this.


224
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.700
Holy cow, what a kick.

225
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.600
- At least you're gonna keep this interesting.
- I told you guys he's fast.


226
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.000
Slow down, kid,
you're gonna blow the turn.


227
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.700
Stripes!

228
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.500
Nice turn, Stripey.
I tried to warn you.


229
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.800
How's that ridge taste?

230
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.700
What can you say? 
Rookie mistake.

231
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.900
- Stripes, are you all right?
- Go back where you belong!


232
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.800
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What a loser!


233
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.600
Get out of here!

234
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.500
- Stripes.
- We don't want you.


235
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.100
- Go home!
- Hey, Stripey.


236
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.500
Did you really think that you could beat
a trained professional?


237
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.200
Hey there, boy.

238
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.800
What's up? What's the matter?

239
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.600
Feel like there's something
you're not telling me.


240
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.900
What, you sick or something?

241
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.700
There you are.
Now you're all gorgeous again.


242
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.600
I can't have my best boy
looking all gnarly, now, can I?


243
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.800
Stay out of the mud.

244
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.300
So you don't know
where the mud came from?


245
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.400
- It didn't come from the Blue Moon Races?
- Nope, just took a mudbath for my arthritis.


246
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.400
Chan!

247
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.100
Helmet.

248
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.700
- Take it easy.
- I'm gonna be late for work.


249
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.800
Yeah, that's right.

250
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.500
Boy, will you get
a load of this dump?

251
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.000
Even Old MacDonald wouldn't want
this farm, but it's perfect.


252
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.300
Miles from the Jersey shore,
not an ocean in sight, not even a birdbath.


253
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.700
No one will look for a classy guy
like the Goose here.


254
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.900
Watch where you're going,
that's my knee.


255
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.000
So that's how we land
in the big city.


256
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.900
If there's no parking space,
you make one.


257
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.100
Any of you mugs got a problem
with that?


258
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.400
Nice landing.
Can we see you take off now?


259
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.700
Are you a small horse
or some sort of an ass?


260
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.100
- Because you look like an ass to me.
- I don't mean to be rude...


261
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.800
...but you seem to be more surf than turf.
Did you take a wrong turn?


262
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.200
Because you look slow, I'll skip the salad
and get to the risotto.


263
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.500
Let's just say I'm having
a little disagreement with my family.


264
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.300
We disagree on whether or not
they should whack me. Name's Goose.


265
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.000
Oh, a pelican named Goose.
Well, my name's Duck.


266
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.900
- Duck? Duck?
- Duck. Goose.


267
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.400
Oh, you're funny.

268
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.500
But there's only room for one wise guy
on this farm, and you should know...


269
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.500
...Goose is a name that strikes fear
into anyone on the East Coast.


270
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.800
Don't shoot! I didn't do it!

271
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.100
It was the horse with the funny hair.
The goat's in on it.


272
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.700
You're fine unless you're being chased
by a tractor.


273
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.900
Look, here's the whole spaghetti sauce.

274
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.500
I'm a hit bird, and when Sammy the Gull
needs a lesson taught...


275
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.300
...the Goose is the guy he calls.

276
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.300
Only this last job, 
I had a little mishap.

277
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.600
Instead of hitting Freddy the Flamingo,
I hit Sammy's capo, Johnny Storkanado.


278
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.500
And now Sammy, Freddy, Johnny,
they're all after me.


279
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.200
- Hey, ever try shutting up?
- Ever try swimming in cement horseshoes?


280
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.800
- I've taken out punks bigger than you.
- What, you talk them to death?


281
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.100
Careful, pony boy, or somebody's gonna
wake up with your head in their bed.


282
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.400
Knew from that pecker
you'd be a bigmouth.


283
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.800
Watch it, stumpy.

284
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.900
I'd cut you off at the knees, but it looks
like somebody's beaten me to it.


285
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.200
All right, knock it off.
Nobody has anything to prove here.


286
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.400
Proof? You want proof, huh?

287
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.700
You see Rusty the Rotating Rooster
up there?


288
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.200
- He's about to get Goosed.
- Where is hunting season when you need it?


289
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.900
Okay, adjust for the wind.
Nice, level flight.


290
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.100
Come on, Goose, use the Force.

291
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.300
Well, you can't say that he couldn't
hit the broadside of a barn door.


292
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.800
Acid rain! Acid rain! I'm blind.
It's too late for me.


293
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:35.100
Save yourselves. I'm going to the light.
I see a bucket of dead relatives!


294
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.600
Extra crispy. Extra crispy!

295
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.600
That's the worst turn
I've ever seen anybody make.


296
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.300
- Awful, terrible, stink-o.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.


297
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.400
The Blue Moon Races
are the worst-kept secret of all time.


298
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.000
I know. I almost had him.

299
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.500
- I should have beaten him, easily.
- Wrong.


300
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.000
You need more than raw talent,
which you have...


301
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.800
...to beat a well-trained racehorse.
It takes skill.


302
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.400
Real skill and real discipline
to become a racer. It's hard work.


303
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.400
Nothing good ever comes easy.

304
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.600
And speaking of hard work...

305
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.500
Oh, boy. See you later, kid.
Good luck.


306
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.600
Tractor's down, Stripes.

307
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.300
Yeah, it's time to earn your keep.

308
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.000
Yeah.

309
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.000
There you go. Easy, take it easy.

310
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.500
Yeah, good boy.

311
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.800
There you go.

312
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.400
Come on, now. Come on, Stripes,
just give it a little more.


313
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.600
Little more.
It's gonna be over that much quicker.


314
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.900
Come on, now.

315
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.300
Come on. Come on.

316
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.900
Hey, sweetness.
Look at your bigtime racehorse now.


317
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.500
Yeah, bigtime.

318
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.900
Check it out.

319
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.800
Hey, plow boy, you missed a spot!

320
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.300
Why don't you guys
go choke on an apple.


321
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.000
Come on, darling, don't go getting
your tail in a knot.


322
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.700
Talk to me. You look frustrated,
what's the matter?


323
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.200
What is it gonna take for me to get
to the track so I can have another shot?


324
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.000
I won't blow sun up your tail.
You're from the wrong side of the fence.


325
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.900
The only chance you've got is...

326
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.800
- Forget it, forget it, forget it.
- No. What? What were you gonna say?


327
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.800
You gotta get someone to ride you
so you can show them.


328
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.700
- A human?
- No, we're gonna strap...


329
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:54.700
...Reggie to your back. Of course a human.
So if you do get to race, you'll be ready.


330
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.500
And pulling that thing can only help.
Put your back into it. Get to work.


331
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.300
Yeah. I will make
it to the track, Tucker.

332
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.300
And when I do, I'm gonna beat Pride
and win the big race.


333
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.500
- Whoa, big fella!
- That's the attitude.


334
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.500
Well, like my mama used to say:

335
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.400
"You can put your boots in the oven,
but that won't make them biscuits."


336
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.000
Good boy.

337
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.200
Good boy.

338
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.300
You did all right, huh.

339
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.100
Yeah.

340
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.700
Good boy.

341
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.600
Hey, there's my best boy.

342
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.700
Been working you hard, hasn't he?

343
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.800
I'll see you later.

344
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.300
All right.
I need to find a way to get rid of you.


345
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.000
That could be arranged.

346
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.100
- Who are you?
- Name's Goose.


347
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.700
Always looking to do a favor
for someone that's been in the joint.


348
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.500
- When'd you get out?
- Out of where?


349
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.300
The pokey, the do-right ranch,
the iron-bar inn.


350
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.100
- Come on, you can level with me.
- What are you talking about?


351
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.000
Oh, you're good.
Yes, you are, you are very good.


352
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.900
So where did you do your stretch?
Sing Sing? Alcatraz? The Bronx Zoo?


353
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.600
Look, how can you help?

354
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.700
All right, listen up,
you glue-factory rejects.


355
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.400
Professor Goose is gonna school youse
in how to take out a motorcycle.


356
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.700
- Class is now in session.
- Will we be tested on this?


357
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.400
Stuff it, McNugget. Rule number one,
we never say nothing.


358
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.300
Even when tortured,
not a word gets out.


359
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.500
Watch this. Look out!
Freddy the Flamingo's right behind you.


360
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.900
- Hey, Goose.
- All right, I'll talk, I'll talk.


361
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.400
It was Vito. Vito Pelligrino from Pier 9.

362
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.600
What do you know? Goose, who was really
a pelican, is really a stool pigeon...


363
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.900
...who is actually a chicken that ducks.

364
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.300
- That makes five birds in one, count them.
- I'm no chicken.


365
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.600
Mind you, I got nothing
against chickens.


366
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.400
I mean, some of my best friends
are chickens. Fowl are fine folks.


367
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.600
All right, let's go, it's time.

368
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.500
Now, you guys stay here.
This ain't gonna be pretty.


369
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.900
Oh, boy, now what do I do?

370
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.700
All right, tough guy, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.


371
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.300
Gentlemen, don't let the feathers fool you,
this dude's dangerous.


372
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.100
He's a killing machine
disguised as an idiot.


373
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.000
Hey, you like that? Huh?
Right in the seat.


374
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.300
Okay, lights out.

375
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.900
Turning up the pain. 
You like that?

376
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.600
Come on, can you hear me?

377
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.300
Oh, a spitter, huh?
Oh, you wanna dance?


378
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.100
You want a piece of the Goose?

379
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:18.100
Karate-chop-a! Poke-a-sock-a!
Smack-a-face-a! Break-a-bones-a!


380
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:31.100
You see?
You call the Goose, and ba-da-bing.


381
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.200
Ba-da-boom.

382
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.800
This is Reggie Redrooster
with the farm report.


383
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.100
In sports news, Goose the Pelican
dropped the motorcycle in the first round.


384
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.200
Then, for good measure,
taught the truck a lesson as well.


385
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.000
Move it along, nothing to see here.

386
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.300
I'm gonna be late for work.

387
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.500
Well, you can take Old Blue.

388
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.000
Oh, that's just great.

389
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.500
Oh, come on.

390
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.200
How long will it take
to put on the spare?


391
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.300
Honey, that is the spare.

392
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.000
What the...?

393
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.600
Can I take Stripes?

394
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.400
- What do you mean, ride him?
- Just for today.


395
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.100
No. No.

396
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.400
Come on, I have to get to work.
Can I take him, please?


397
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.700
Honey, no.

398
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.500
Besides, I'd never be able
to get a saddle on him.


399
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.300
All right, so I got a saddle on him,
big deal.


400
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.800
Not like he's gonna let you ride him.

401
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.500
- You don't know him like I do.
- Well...


402
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.600
...even if he does let you,
you know how I feel.


403
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.400
I've been riding since I was 5.

404
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.500
- That's not the point.
- Come on.


405
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.500
I mean, it's almost like he wants
to be ridden.


406
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.200
Oh, honey. Honey, come on.

407
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.300
Just let me try.

408
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.200
Come on, come on.

409
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.300
Careful.

410
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.500
- Now we're talking.
- Talking to who?


411
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.600
What you been talking about?
You been training Stripes, haven't you?


412
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.200
Just nice and easy.

413
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.900
Run like the wind.
Show them what you got.


414
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.300
Will you shut up?

415
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.900
I'm the coach, you're the goat.
Now, listen to the way it's done.


416
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.400
Run like the wind, kid!
Show them what you got!


417
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.200
See, that's coaching.

418
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.000
Come on, Stripes. Come on.

419
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.400
Come on, boy!

420
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.300
Good boy.

421
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.500
Better get going back!
Circus must be in town!


422
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.100
I used to see spots,
now I'm seeing stripes.


423
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.100
Where'd that come from?

424
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.000
Shouldn't you be
on a carousel somewhere?


425
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.300
- This ain't the zoo!
- Oh, no way.


426
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.900
- Go home!
- Go home, four left hooves!


427
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.100
- Haven't you learned?
- You don't fit in!


428
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.400
- Hoof it!
- We don't want you!


429
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.500
- Nobody asked you here, freak!
- Yeah, no freaks allowed.


430
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.000
I'll see you later, buddy. Be good.

431
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.000
Those guys aren't so fast.
I can take them.


432
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.200
Scuzz, how can you ruin
a great song like that?


433
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.800
Oh, come on, man!
That song's already ruined.


434
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.300
You need some good tunes like this:

435
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.100
- Those aren't even the words.
- The words don't matter, man!


436
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.000
You know "you can't touch this,"
the rest of it's gold.


437
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.500
Okay, smart boy,
just go fly yourself into a fan.


438
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.600
Now, come on, let's go get some food.
Just follow me.


439
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.300
Waiter! Table for one, please.

440
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.700
Hey, why don't you take a closer look.

441
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.000
I'll tell Mom!

442
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.500
Scuzz, I don't believe it.
I got 20 million brothers and sisters...


443
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.300
...and Mom tells me
that I gotta look out for you.


444
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.900
Well, that's because it's easy, dumb-dumb.
Nothing bad ever happens to me!


445
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:39.500
Scuzz, you know what?
Bad is the only thing that happens to you!


446
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.900
- Hey, pull my wing.
- No.


447
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.600
It's not like before.
I promise, nothing will happen.


448
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.800
Never, never fall for that. 
It's too easy!

449
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.600
Who does that thing belong to?

450
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.800
He's mine, Miss Dalrymple.
I had no other way of getting here.


451
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.900
- I'll go put him in the stables.
- Yes, and from now on...


452
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.900
...you will leave him at that petting zoo you
and your father so laughably call a farm.


453
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.000
This is a racetrack, dear,
not the Serengeti.


454
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.600
You don't know the words
to that either.


455
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.600
I can make up a rap about anything.

456
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.900
Hey. Hey, what's that?

457
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.800
Well, that's obvious.
It's the racetrack referee.


458
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:47.400
Buzz, check this out.
Hey, pal, why the long face?


459
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.600
- Thank you!
- "Why the long face?"


460
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.100
- Still got it!
- What are you doing? Look.


461
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.800
You're a horse!
You all have long faces, get it?


462
00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.300
- It's a joke!
- I've heard all the jokes.


463
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.300
The others have been making fun
of me since I was born.


464
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.200
- I know I'm different.
- You think you had it rough?


465
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.100
You try starting out life as a maggot.
Nobody wants to pet a little maggot.


466
00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.800
- Nobody.
- Scuzz, Scuzz, Scuzz. Come on, now. Easy.


467
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.900
Seriously, what's with the stripes?
Are you making some kind of statement?


468
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.400
Yeah, you know, I saw you...

469
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.900
...and I was about to say
to my brother Buzz:


470
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.600
"I never seen a black horse
with white stripes."


471
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.600
You dimwit! He is obviously
a white horse with black stripes!


472
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.100
Now, anybody could see that.

473
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.400
Guys, look out!

474
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.200
- Are we dead? Are we dead?
- Well, if we are...


475
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.300
...Buzz, we're in heaven!

476
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.200
Here comes your open winner, Miss D.

477
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.800
Yes, well, he better be, Mr. Cooper.

478
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.400
Anything less than a victory,
and you'll be back shoveling manure.


479
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.400
- See you, Woodzie.
- Night, Ken.


480
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.800
What are you doing, boy?
We shouldn't be out here.


481
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.000
I know, boy.

482
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.400
I feel it too.

483
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.900
When I was little...

484
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.000
...my mama used to bring me out here
at around this time.


485
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.200
Put me on the saddle behind her...

486
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.100
...take me once around the track.

487
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.500
It was like magic.

488
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.300
Come on, boy! Come on!

489
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.100
Go! Let's go, boy!

490
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.000
Easy, boy. Come on.

491
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.400
Attaboy.

492
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.500
Easy does it.

493
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.400
Good boy.

494
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.400
Channing!

495
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.100
- Hold on a second.
- Woodzie.


496
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.900
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
- Mum's the word.


497
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.400
Well, who's your friend?

498
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.400
- Some turn of foot.
- This is Stripes.


499
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.700
- He's quick, huh?
- I'll say.


500
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.500
Like to get a
watch on him for real.

501
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.900
Dad doesn't want me to ride,
let alone race.


502
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Well, that's a crime.
You move just like your mom.


503
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:07.800
God rest her soul.
And not even a proper saddle.


504
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.800
A trainer friend of mine's working
some horses in the time trial tomorrow.


505
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.900
Why don't you come out early
and join in.


506
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.900
Yeah, you think about it.

507
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.700
Hey.

508
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.000
Forget where the house is?

509
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.600
Miss Dalrymple made me stay late.

510
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.600
- I can't stand her.
- Don't give me excuses.


511
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.100
And don't take it out on her.
If anything, you should pity her.


512
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.600
She sees a horse, she doesn't see beauty.
She just sees business.


513
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.800
I don't see how you ever worked for her.
She's such a pain.


514
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.300
I let most of it go in one ear
and out the other.


515
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.000
It was worth it. I got a chance to work
with some mighty fine horses.


516
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.900
We could do it again, you know.

517
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.100
- Chan...
- Dad...


518
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.400
...everybody says you're still the best.

519
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.100
We just need a few horses
to get us started.


520
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.900
Then we could put old Dalrymple
out to pasture.


521
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.600
That's in the past, honey.

522
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.900
I fixed the flat.
You can take Blue to work tomorrow.


523
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.300
But I wanna ride Stripes.

524
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.100
He was great, Dad.
You should've seen him!


525
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.100
That was a one-shot deal.

526
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.900
You know how I feel.

527
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.600
- What about how I feel?
- Discussion's over.


528
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.500
- But, Dad...
- I said no, Chan.


529
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.600
You are so busy trying to keep me
from hurting myself like Mom...


530
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.100
...that you won't give me a chance
to just try anything.


531
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.300
Well, just because you've given up
on your dreams doesn't mean that I have to.


532
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.600
He treats me like
I'm still a little girl.

533
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.400
Well, I'm not.

534
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.300
I wanna race.

535
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.900
I'm gonna race...

536
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800
...and no one can stop me.

537
00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.300
Doesn't anybody have a clock?

538
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.100
Easy, girl.

539
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.300
Hey! It's Woodzie.

540
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.700
No! Help me! I'm drowning!

541
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.700
Get out of there, Scuzz!
That's the man's expresso!


542
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.700
I know.

543
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.700
I'm expressing myself.

544
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.900
You are the reason
they invented fly swatters.


545
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.400
There are those that say Trenton's Pride
is the only real contender this year.


546
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.300
- How do you feel about that?
- Well, dear, how do you feel about that?


547
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.700
Miss Dalrymple, how does Trenton's Pride
compare with his legendary father?


548
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.300
Well, I like to believe that
I can see a good bet, and l...


549
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.700
What...? Where's...? What the...?

550
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.900
Excuse me. Excuse me!

551
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.800
I can't believe we're being upstaged
by a zebra.


552
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.200
What is that dreadful child up to now?

553
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.500
How can they allow this to happen?

554
00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.700
- Eat my dust, runt!
- Loser!


555
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.100
I'm gonna run you down!
Who do you think you are?


556
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.100
You don't belong here!

557
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.400
You don't know nothing about this!

558
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.500
You're a joke!

559
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.100
It's all right, boy. 
It's all right.

560
00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.400
Let's go, boy! Whoa, whoa, Stripes.

561
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.500
Come on, come on, boy!
Come on, Stripes!


562
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.400
Come on!

563
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.700
Come on, boy! Come on!

564
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.500
Faster! Come on, buddy!

565
00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.100
Attaboy!

566
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.300
Faster, Stripes, faster! Come on!

567
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.100
Who would have thought a zebra
could have such a kick?


568
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.500
He's on the rail and moving fast.

569
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.200
Chan!

570
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.400
- Oh, my.
- Come on, come on, let's go!


571
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.000
You better make sure you get this, Mike.

572
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.900
Chan!

573
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.200
- Chan!
- Nothing's broken.


574
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.800
Honey, just look in my eyes.

575
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.500
- Dad, it's nothing.
- Listen.


576
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.300
- It's fine.
- This is what I told you was gonna happen.


577
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.800
- Your father's right.
- He just got spooked. It's not his fault.


578
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.300
- He just needs some more training.
- Yes, right.


579
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:37.100
I'm sure that more than half of the blame
sits squarely on the shoulders of his rider.


580
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.100
- You're such a...
- Chan. Chan, Chan!


581
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.200
Just go get Stripes
and meet me in the parking lot.


582
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.100
You so obsessed with winning
you'll pick on a girl?


583
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.600
Really, Nolan.
You expect me to dignify that?


584
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:56.400
I'm just a Kentucky gal who loves watching
Thoroughbreds race at the top of their game.


585
00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.700
Of course you are.

586
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.700
I'll tell you what.

587
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
As chairman of the Turfway Board...

588
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.500
...I hereby extend an invitation
to Mr. Walsh...


589
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.400
...to enter his zebra in the Kentucky Open.

590
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.200
All it takes is an entrance fee.

591
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.800
How about that, Mr. Walsh?

592
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.200
- Mr. Walsh?
- Mr. Walsh?


593
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.000
Well, there goes the great Nolan Walsh,
everyone.


594
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.900
Corn farmer and zebra trainer.
And you can print that.


595
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.300
Hey, Clara, can they print that you
ain't won the Kentucky Open...


596
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.500
...since Nolan stopped training
your horses for you?


597
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.800
- What do you have to say about that?
- Mind your own business.


598
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.200
You there! See what happens
when you forget your place.


599
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.700
A racetrack is no place for a zebra.

600
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.100
- What did you just call me?
- A zebra!


601
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.400
Which is what you are.

602
00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.200
You didn't really think
you were a horse, did you?


603
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.800
But I am a horse. A racehorse.

604
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.200
You're nothing of the kind.

605
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.600
You're lunch for a lion,
and that's about it.


606
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.400
One thing's for sure, kid.
You will never be a racehorse.


607
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.300
A zebra? I thought I was a racehorse.

608
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.600
Why didn't anyone tell me?

609
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.900
Well, I just can't believe
you deliberately disobeyed me.


610
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.000
- I can't believe you took her side.
- I didn't.


611
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.200
And don't change the subject.

612
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.800
- Mom would've let me ride.
- Don't bring your mother into this!


613
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.200
Just don't.

614
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.700
Why not?

615
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.000
At least she would've tried to understand.
It's more than I can say for you!


616
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.800
Don't get out of the truck!

617
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.700
Channing, get back in the truck.

618
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.900
Don't do it.

619
00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.500
Well, well, well.

620
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.500
Look what the cat drug in.

621
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.600
Don't shoot me, don't shoot me!

622
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.200
Jersey flashback.

623
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.200
Hey, we made it, man! Nice!
That sure beats flying.


624
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.900
We made it, but...

625
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.900
- Well, little Skeeter here didn't.
- Oh, no.


626
00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.900
You know, that's why Mom always said:

627
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.300
- "Look both ways before crossing."
- "Look both ways before crossing."


628
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.100
Afternoon, Woodzie.

629
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.400
- What brings you out here?
- I got a hunch about your zebra.


630
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.100
Look at this.

631
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.700
I left it right where it was
this morning.


632
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.500
- Twenty-three seconds a quarter mile?
- He didn't finish...


633
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.100
...but I got him between the quarter pole
and the half-mile pole.


634
00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.700
Twenty-three flat.

635
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.800
Your zebra.

636
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.500
Look, that zebra really wants to race.
I can see it.


637
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.400
You just need to train him.

638
00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.000
Where would I do that?

639
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.200
And even if I could, I mean...

640
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.600
...you got the $5000 entrance fee?
I don't.


641
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.800
I do. And I won most of it
betting on your horses.


642
00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.100
I know a good bet when I see it,
and I can't bet him if he's not in the race.


643
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.900
Come on, Nolan.

644
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.100
No. That's final.

645
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.600
Too poor to paint,
too proud to whitewash.


646
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.100
He's not gonna let Stripes race.
That's not cool.


647
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.200
Let's go talk to Tucker.

648
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.900
- Guess who.
- Hey, Buzz and Scuzz!


649
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.700
How you been, fellas?

650
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.900
- We miss you down at the track.
- Those were great years.


651
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.300
Yeah, yeah. Listen, listen.
We got some bad news for Stripes.


652
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.500
Let me guess. His parole officers caught up
with him. Don't let them take you.


653
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.300
Is he always like this?

654
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.900
- Worse. Much worse.
- Anyway, listen, kid.


655
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.200
- The Chief isn't gonna let you race.
- But don't worry. We'll cheer you up.


656
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.900
Check this one out.

657
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.200
Get off me, you stupid flies! Get off!

658
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.200
Man, "Ebony and Ivory" didn't work.
That's a first.


659
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.200
- Told you we should've rapped.
- Stripes.


660
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.900
Walking away isn't gonna solve anything.

661
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.000
Who cares. Leave me alone!

662
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:10.000
- We've gotta get this kid into the race.
- The Chief will never go for it.


663
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.900
Of course he will.
Just like somebody else I know.


664
00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.900
He just needs a little push.

665
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.500
I'm going to bed.

666
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.800
Channing?

667
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.100
- Yeah?
- Why don't you come on out here.


668
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.300
Come on.

669
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:42.100
This is gonna be a hard one, honey.

670
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.900
Probably the only thing to do,
really the obvious thing...


671
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.300
...is to get rid of the problem.

672
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.200
What?

673
00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.500
Dad.

674
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.400
No!

675
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.300
It's not Stripes' fault.
He's not the problem. It's my fault.


676
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Dad, you can't just get rid of him.

677
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:05.900
l... I know him
better than anyone ever could.


678
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.900
I love him.

679
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.400
What do you think the alternative is?

680
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.000
I don't ride him.

681
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.900
Ever, ever again.

682
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.100
That's right, honey.

683
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.300
Franny?

684
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.500
Hey.

685
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.900
Hey.

686
00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.900
How did you know?

687
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.200
If you build it, they will come.

688
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.500
Well, it's showtime, kid.
You ready to start training?


689
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.500
Why bother?

690
00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.400
I don't understand this.
Isn't this what he wanted?


691
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.900
This is exactly why I never had kids.

692
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.400
- Reggie?
- Yes?


693
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.700
Get off my back.

694
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.700
Hey, hotshot.

695
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.600
- Run into any trees lately?
- Oh, great. More jokes.


696
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.800
- I really wanna be alone, Sandy.
- What's going on with you?


697
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.400
That doesn't sound like the attitude
of a racehorse.


698
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.800
Because I'm not a racehorse.
I'm not even a regular horse.


699
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.900
- I'm a...
- Zebra?


700
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I know. I've traveled
around the world, remember?


701
00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:29.600
Why didn't you say anything?

702
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.600
Because I don't care
that you're not a racehorse.


703
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.200
You love to run,
and that's all that matters.


704
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.200
Maybe to you.
But it's not your problem, Sandy.


705
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.800
You know, if you wanna see
the real problem, try looking down.


706
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.400
Fine.

707
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.100
After we're done with the gate...

708
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.600
...we need to think about
how he's gonna last.


709
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.100
So we gotta work on stamina,
more than speed...


710
00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.300
...because zebras burn more adrenaline.

711
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.100
They have a heightened flight reflex...

712
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.400
...that comes from being hunted
on the plains of Africa.


713
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.600
You're not the only one who uses
the Internet.


714
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.900
- Impressive, Dad.
- Come on, let's get back to it.


715
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.200
Let's give him one more shot at it.

716
00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.900
All right, bring him in. 
That's it, that's it.

717
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.000
Careful, Chan. Careful.

718
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.300
It's all right. Stop. Walk him away.
Now, just walk him away from the gate.


719
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.800
The gate's always trouble.
They should know.


720
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.100
He needs a break. He needs a break.
So do I.


721
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:42.100
- I don't know why he's acting like this.
- It's gonna take him some time, that's all.


722
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.000
He'll be all right.

723
00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:57.000
- I better go talk to the kid.
- Take it easy on him.


724
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.000
- Hey, what's your problem?
- I'm not a racehorse.


725
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
- What?
- I don't belong in the gate!


726
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.400
No, no, you're wrong.
And I'll tell you why.


727
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:10.500
Racing is for anyone.
Anyone with a fire in their heart.


728
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.600
What do you know, you little nobody?
You never raced.


729
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.900
They're all the same.

730
00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.200
Tucker doesn't understand.

731
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.700
He didn't even know that I was a zebra.
He doesn't get it. What's he ever done?


732
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.000
Let me tell you something.
I've made a few clams on the ponies.


733
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.300
This guy's all hair and no brains.

734
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.900
That's just about enough out of you,
young colt. And, Goose, bang!


735
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.300
Hit the hay!

736
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.100
Come here.
People think they know everything.


737
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.800
You tell somebody something,
they get an attitude.


738
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.800
Hey, I didn't know the goat
was packing.


739
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.300
Come up here.
I want you to take a look up there.


740
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.700
- You tell me what you see.
- I've seen them.


741
00:58:54.900 --> 00:59:00.600
- The Chief, my girl and her mother.
- And that's it? No. Look closer.


742
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:02.700
- That's Sir Trenton.
- And who else?


743
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.900
- Tucker.
- That's right, Tucker.


744
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.600
He trained Sir Trenton.
He and the Chief trained all the winners.


745
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.100
And not one of them ever,
ever thanked him.


746
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.500
- How come he never said anything?
- Because to him...


747
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.700
...actions speak louder than words.
He believes in you.


748
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.500
And now you're gonna
have to believe in him too.


749
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.500
I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. I'm
the last one who should be name-calling.


750
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.700
Look at me. When you got shorter legs
than a sheepdog...


751
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:36.700
...you get used to being made fun of.
I can relate.


752
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.600
It's just...

753
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.900
I'm not really a racehorse.

754
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.900
I'm a...

755
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
- I'm a zebra.
- So what?


756
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.300
You're a horse with stripes
who needs an attitude adjustment.


757
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.900
Tucker, you don't really think
I have what it takes, do you?


758
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.700
Now listen to me, kid. You're right.

759
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.300
You don't have the strength or ability
of a Thoroughbred...


760
00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.900
- I knew it.
...but you have got more heart...


761
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.200
...than all of them put together.

762
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:07.500
But the gate! I freeze up.
It keeps me from running.


763
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
I don't know what it is. 
I can't do it.

764
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.100
Most horses are afraid of
the gate at first.


765
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.300
It's perfectly normal.
But they get over it. You will too.


766
01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.100
You just keep running, okay?
And let the Chief worry about the gate.


767
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.100
He knows what he's doing.

768
01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.000
Attaboy!

769
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.100
Yeah, boy!

770
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.700
Did you see that? You see that?
Good job, Chan!


771
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.600
There it is! That's what I'm talking about!

772
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.800
Good job, Chan! Walk him out.

773
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.800
We might actually have a chance.

774
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.600
If we're lucky, maybe at 99-1.

775
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.900
There's just one thing left to work on.

776
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.400
- And that's the gate.
- No problem.


777
01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.700
You've worked every kind
of horse there is.


778
01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.200
Yeah, well, the problem is,
he's not a horse.


779
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.300
Relax, Nolan.
If anyone can do it, you can.


780
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400
I'm counting on it.

781
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.700
It's gonna sound like a carnival.

782
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.700
You won't know which way to look.
Look straight ahead.


783
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.200
Just ignore all that noise, all that talk,
all that yelling, all that jiggling.


784
01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.500
Come on, now.

785
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.700
You gotta let all this...

786
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.200
This out of your mind.

787
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.800
All that's gotta fall away.

788
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.200
That's right. That's right.

789
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.200
Because I want your world
to be silent.


790
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:04.500
I want you to hear nothing
but your own heartbeat.


791
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.300
That's it.

792
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.500
Easy does it. Come on, buddy.

793
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.100
- That's a good boy.
- Good boy.


794
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.600
- Good boy.
- That's it. You got the idea.


795
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.600
- Come on, now.
- Good job, Stripes.


796
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.500
Good boy. Chan, duck your head.
That's not so hard. Slow down.


797
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.000
- Good boy. Easy does it.
- Good boy. Just like that. There you go.


798
01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.200
Good.

799
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.000
That's right, good boy.

800
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.700
Attaboy.

801
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.300
Easy does it.

802
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.800
Good boy.

803
01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.500
- You did it.
- Yeah, I guess I did, huh?


804
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.200
Now what?

805
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.400
Now you give it all you got.

806
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.200
- Let's show them what we got!
- They cannot be serious.


807
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.300
This will not stand. I will not allow
that beast to run in my competition.


808
01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:10.700
Please, Father, don't interfere.
I can win it, fair and square.


809
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.100
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

810
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.500
Double Pride's workout schedule.

811
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.600
Pull! Pull! Come on, pull!

812
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.100
Come on, Scuzz! What are you
doing here? Give it to me! Push!


813
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:31.700
I can't do no more, take it!
Put the marshmallows back on!


814
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.300
You ate the marshmallows!

815
01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.600
Stretch him out! Lighten up on him!
Lighten up on him!


816
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.900
Boy, are you in for a surprise.

817
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.200
You'll never beat a Trenton.

818
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.900
- You weren't supposed to hear that.
- Oh, God, what is that?


819
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.600
I got a million eyes,
and you got every one of them burning!


820
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.300
- Well, tomorrow's the big day, kid.
- Do you think I'm ready?


821
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.200
Absolutely. Listen, you can run,
there's no doubt about that.


822
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.700
Your legs are gonna be burning
when you're turning for home.


823
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.100
That's when you find out
what you're made of.


824
01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.800
You know what I used to tell my racers?
"Don't look back, leave it all on the track."


825
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.500
- What does that mean?
- Kid, when the time is right, you'll know.


826
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.400
Hello?

827
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.600
Where you think you going?
You have a big day tomorrow. You can't go.


828
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.100
I need to make things right with Sandy.

829
01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.400
All right. I understand.

830
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.000
But listen, a little advice
from an old goat:


831
01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:22.900
Relationships are like racing. When you do it
for love, you've already won.


832
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.200
Go on, go on.

833
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.500
- Hey, Sandy.
- What?


834
01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.700
I was hoping you'd come by.

835
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.900
- I'm sorry that I was mean.
- I'm sorry that l...


836
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.100
- You go first.
- The things I said the other day?


837
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.200
- I just wanna say I was wrong.
- Well, yeah.


838
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.100
You just... You got me so mad
because you weren't seeing it!


839
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.600
- Seeing what?
- How lucky you are.


840
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.200
- Me, lucky?
- Yes.


841
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.100
The grass is way greener on your side
of the fence.


842
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.200
Look at the training facilities. You've got
everything a horse could dream of.


843
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.400
Yeah, everything except real friends.

844
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.500
Friends like you have.
And a friend like I bet you are.


845
01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:21.600
Listen, Sandy, I know I don't look
like a racehorse, but...


846
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.700
Stop! Stop.

847
01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.500
You know, I care more about what's on the
inside, and you have more on the inside...


848
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:33.000
...than any of the horses over there.
And I also happen to think...


849
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.300
...that what you have on the outside
is the cutest thing on four hooves.


850
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:44.000
And, just so you know,
I'm already on your side.


851
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.000
Well, well, well. 
What have we here?

852
01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.000
- Beauty and the beast.
- Oh, no. Sir Trenton.


853
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.500
I'm afraid there's been
a change of plans, zebra.


854
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.900
You're about to get scratched
from tomorrow's racecard.


855
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.500
- Oh, no. There are so many.
- It's okay. Let's stay calm.


856
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.300
- Pretty picture, huh, boys?
- Don't do this, Sir Trenton, please!


857
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.100
- Take her away.
- All right, boss.


858
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.200
- Let's go.
- Sandy!


859
01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.700
Stripes, I'm not going
anywhere without you!


860
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.900
- It's all right, Sandy. Just go.
- Yeah!


861
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.200
Better hide your eyes there, honey!

862
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:32.400
We're out of here. Trust me,
you don't wanna see this.


863
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.100
- You better not hurt her.
- Oh, don't fret about her.


864
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.200
As long as you don't race tomorrow,
I wouldn't dream of harming her.


865
01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.200
You, on the other hand,
need to be taught a lesson.


866
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.100
Show him!

867
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.900
Oh, that's just great!
The race is in four hours.


868
01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:07.700
Well, he went out last night,
he said he was gonna go find Sandy and...


869
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.500
And you, Miss Softy,
you just let him go, didn't you?


870
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.600
- Goose, time to earn your keep.
- I'm on it!


871
01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.700
Where are you, kid? 
Where are you?

872
01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.000
Looks like the work of a pro.

873
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.400
Hey, kid. Kid, come on, wake up!
How many wings am I holding up?


874
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.500
- Is he okay?
- Goose, go get him some water.


875
01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.100
I knew I should've stayed with him
last night.


876
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.500
They have Sandy.
Sir Trenton's gonna hurt her if I race.


877
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.900
Those dirty rats. I say we get busy
and show those bums what for!


878
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.400
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
No, you right. You are right.


879
01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.400
Let us go and kick some horse flank.
Come on, y'all!


880
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.800
Let's move in with the SWAT team!

881
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.400
Quiet!

882
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.500
Thank you. Now, listen. To rescue Sandy,
we all have to work together.


883
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.200
Just when I think I'm out,
they pull me back in!


884
01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.300
Here's the plan. And I don't know why
I didn't think of this earlier.


885
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.300
I could build a giant wooden chicken
and hide inside.


886
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:49.600
Then, under cover of night,
I'll jump out and I'II...


887
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.300
Or I could just stay home.

888
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.200
Knock it off, Reggie. Now, listen up.
Here's what we're gonna do.


889
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.400
Listen, boy. I won this race...

890
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.600
...my daddy won it, his daddy won it,
all the way back to General Trenton...


891
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.700
...who won the first Kentucky Open

892
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.700
- I'll do my best, Dad.
- Yeah, well, good.


893
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.800
You won't get away with this.

894
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.300
Hush, now, little girl.
You're interfering with my Mozart.


895
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.500
I wonder if he was a Thoroughbred.

896
01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.300
- There's Sandy.
- And there's Sir Trenton...


897
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.000
...all 1500 pounds of him.
We'll never get her out.


898
01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.500
Oh, yes, we will.
We just need a diversion.


899
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.000
I got your diversion right here.
Out of my way.


900
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.500
Goose! Stick with the plan!

901
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.000
Hey, moron! Up here!

902
01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.200
Never side against the family.

903
01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.200
Will you remind me again
why we brought him?


904
01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.700
- Hey, who killed the lights?
- How did you get in here?


905
01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.300
Say your prayers, pelican.
Your lights are about to go out for good.


906
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.800
- Can I get a little help here?
- Oh, great. There goes plan A.


907
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.800
- Say hello...
- To plan B!


908
01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:09.200
Horse's booty at 12 o'clock.
Follow me, you're my wingman.


909
01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.700
No way! You follow me! You are
my wingman! I am not your wingman!


910
01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.700
You're my "pull my wing" man!

911
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.400
Whoa, dude.
A little trim wouldn't kill you!


912
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.000
What is that hideous racket?

913
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.700
Get back here! Come on,
I'll fight you with one wing behind my back.


914
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.800
Nobody is allowed in my stables!

915
01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.700
I'll shut you up for good!

916
01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.800
Scuzz! You always get us in trouble.

917
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.400
Hey, Trenton! Walk this way.

918
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.100
- Break it down!
- What in the...?


919
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.800
- This just ain't my speed here.
- You can do it.


920
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.600
- You're Superfly, son.
- All right, step back and watch me work.


921
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.900
Turn this up, now!

922
01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.700
Say it like you mean it!

923
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.700
Come on, now!

924
01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.200
What is going on here?

925
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.200
- Tucker, get Sandy.
- You're the boss.


926
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.800
What?

927
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.800
- Come on, Sandy.
- Tucker! You old rail rat!


928
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.000
- I might've known!
- Let's go! Quick!


929
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.300
You and your animal freak show
have gotten in my way for the last time!


930
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.800
- Those legs won't carry you far, Tucker!
- Hey! Wait for us!


931
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.400
Where are they?

932
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.400
- Come on.
- Stripes! Over here!


933
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.200
Sandy!

934
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.000
Look out, he's coming!

935
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:48.400
- I'm getting too old for this.
- You was born too old for this. Let's go!


936
01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.800
- You won't get away with this!
- Leave us alone, Sir Trenton.


937
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.500
You and your foolish friends
accomplished nothing.


938
01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.500
The affections of a filly
do not make you a racehorse!


939
01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.100
You know something, Sir Trenton?
I don't want to be a racehorse.


940
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.100
I'm a zebra.
And I'm going to the big race.


941
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.700
- You fool.
- Come on, Tucker.


942
01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.000
- Let's go win ourselves a horserace.
- I like your attitude.


943
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.800
You runts don't know
what you're in for.


944
01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.300
Well, he's nowhere south of the barn.

945
01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.100
He's not by the creek either.
What are we gonna do?


946
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.400
We're gonna keep looking.
We'll start at the top of the hill.


947
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.300
Well, let's go! 
We got a race to run.

948
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.900
Stripes is missing.
We don't know what happened.


949
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.800
What are you talking about?
He looks okay to me.


950
01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.800
Chan, get him cleaned up
and loaded right now.


951
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.400
You got it, coach.

952
01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.900
- It's the filly.
- It always is.


953
01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:51.000
Hey! Hey, she's from Philly.

954
01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.900
I didn't know she was from Philly.
Man, I love those Philly cheesesteaks.


955
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.400
Or any kind of cheese, really. Or any food
from anywhere. Especially candy and poop.


956
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.100
- What were we talking about?
- I hate my life.


957
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:13.400
Guys, I'm not gonna let Tucker
have all the fun.


958
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.000
- There's no way I'm missing this.
- Hey, hold on!


959
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.800
Wait for me!

960
01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.200
This chicken is flying the coop!

961
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.300
Finally, some peace and quiet.
Y'all go ahead. Bye-bye, now.


962
01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.500
I'll just stay here and watch the palace.
For shizzle.


963
01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.300
Hang on a second. I just...

964
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.800
I think your mom would've wanted
you to have that.


965
01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.400
Dad...

966
01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.000
...I don't know what to say.

967
01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.400
Well, you were right.
You know, I've been...


968
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.600
...scared since Mom died.

969
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.300
You know, too scared to train horses...

970
01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.600
...too scared to let you grow up.

971
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.700
You forgive your old man?

972
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.700
Daddy, you're not old.

973
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.200
- Maybe a little gray.
- All right, well, let's get a move on.


974
01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.500
Riders, up!

975
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.100
There you go. Okay, come on.

976
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.300
Stay away from the rail, now.
Don't get boxed in.


977
01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you all please stand...


978
01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:10.900
...and join in singing the national anthem.

979
01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.700
When you're in the gate,
don't listen to the other racers.


980
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.600
Let them do all the horsing around.
Save your energy for when it counts.


981
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.300
Right. But, Tucker,
I do kind of feel sick to my stomach.


982
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.500
Good. That means you're ready.

983
01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:00.000
This is Courtney Jones, KNN,
coming to you live...


984
01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.800
...from Turfway Park, where
horseracing history is about to be made.


985
01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.200
- Can a zebra...?
- Sentimental favorite, Stripes...


986
01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.800
...can beat Trenton's Pride.

987
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.900
He is trained by the legendary
Nolan Walsh...


988
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
...who came out of retirement
specifically for this race.


989
01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.700
Stripes is ridden by the remarkable

990
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.400
What could go down as extraordinary
in the history of horseracing...


991
01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.700
...is taking place at Turfway Park.

992
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.100
Only a few short weeks ago, no one
had ever heard of Stripes, the racing zebra.


993
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.100
Nolan.

994
01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.700
Clara.

995
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.500
Beautiful day, huh?

996
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:51.100
It would be if you weren't working
so hard to ruin my race day...


997
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.500
...with that glorified donkey of yours.

998
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.100
You're chipper
for someone who's about to lose.


999
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.800
You wanna make this more interesting?
I mean...


1000
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.000
- I'm listening.
- All right. I'll make you a deal.


1001
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.300
My zebra wins, I get your filly,
the white jumper.


1002
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.200
And your horse wins, I'II...

1003
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.700
I'll give you the Walsh farm.

1004
01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:18.900
Nolan. My filly is worth twice as much
as your piece of land.


1005
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.700
I tell you what. You lose,
and you come back to work for me.


1006
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.600
Lifetime contract, in writing.

1007
01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.800
Deal.

1008
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.400
It'll be real nice
to have you back, Nolan.


1009
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:47.100
All right, no speeches.
You all know what to do. Go get them.


1010
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.400
There he is! Come on, Franny!

1011
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.100
You didn't think we'd let you
have all the glory to yourself.


1012
01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.300
Just like old times, Franny.

1013
01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
the starter has now called the roll.


1014
01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:21.500
The horses are approaching
the starting gate.


1015
01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.000
I'm gonna grind you into the track,
pony boy!


1016
01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.000
- You're pathetic!
- You're going down!


1017
01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.500
- Knock you out of the park!
- Gonna get trampled!


1018
01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.400
You're a joke!

1019
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.400
They're all in.

1020
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:16.800
And away they go. Marietta's Rock,
Pirate's Cove and Trenton's Pride...


1021
01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:19.700
...came away smartly,
with Jordan's Revenge...


1022
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.100
- Ride, Stripes!
- Go! Come on, Stripes!


1023
01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.700
Ruffshodd keeping Stripes
tight on the rail...


1024
01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:28.300
...with Marc's A Mystery,
Flemish Fury and Brown-Nose-Biren.


1025
01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.700
As they head into the first corner,
Marietta's Rock's gone ahead to lead...


1026
01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.100
You're out of your league, freak!

1027
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.300
You should've stuck
to racing the mailman.


1028
01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:44.600
- Tell Tucker Ruffshodd's got him boxed in!
- Copy that, Goose!


1029
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.800
Ten-four! Roger Wilco!

1030
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.300
Trenton's Pride is back in third.
Stripes is along the inside...


1031
01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:53.200
- Ruffshodd's boxed him in.
- Tell Stripes hug the rail...


1032
01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.300
...and make his move at the turn.
- Got it! Let's fly!


1033
01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.800
- Hey, Buzz?
- What?


1034
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.700
Did you notice the irony
when you said, "Let's fly"?


1035
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.200
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just asking.


1036
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.800
Because we are flies and all.
Do you ever think about that stuff?


1037
01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.300
Would you shut up?

1038
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.700
Tucker says to hug the rail
and make your move at the turn.


1039
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.700
You're doing great!
You're doing great!


1040
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:18.800
- Mistake. Miyuki's Magic is a long leader
outside, then comes Marc's A Mystery...


1041
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.200
How does the rail taste?

1042
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.500
You'll never see the finish line!

1043
01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.200
Ruffshodd's putting the Jersey
squeeze on him. That's a dirty trick!


1044
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:40.400
Oh, not for long.
Time to take a bite out of crime.


1045
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.400
Oh, I hate horse meat. Here goes.

1046
01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.900
- coming out of the turn. And Ruffshodd
has inexplicably tossed his rider!


1047
01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.500
And Ruffshodd is out of the race!

1048
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
- Marietta's Rock...
- That's my boy.


1049
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.700
You've always been a pain in the butt.

1050
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.700
They're down the back stretch.
Trenton's Pride is running the perfect race.


1051
01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:09.100
He's moving like an absolute winner.
Trenton's Pride, right up there in third spot.


1052
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:13.600
The sentimental choice, Stripes, is coming
under pressure and starting to drop back.


1053
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.800
- Stripes seems to be running out of steam.
- Had enough, boy?


1054
01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:21.200
Trenton's Pride is going strongly up
there amongst the leading line.


1055
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.000
Three parts of the way through the race,
Marietta's Rock still in front...


1056
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.900
...from Pirate's Cove, then Trenton's Pride
moving like a winner in third.


1057
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
It was just too
much to ask of him.

1058
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.200
- in comes Miyuki's Magic.

1059
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.200
By a league is Pirate's Cove...

1060
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.200
- I can't do it. I can't do it!
- Stripes is in the rear.


1061
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.500
Oh, boy. Maybe I was wrong.
He might not have it.


1062
01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:48.900
- The kid... The kid is wiped out.
- Yeah, he's falling back fast.


1063
01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.300
All right. Okay. 
One last shot.

1064
01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:56.200
You tell him if he believes he's not good
enough, he should stop trying. It's okay.


1065
01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:00.500
This is Superfly. We're proceeding
to the target. Do you copy, Scuzz?


1066
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:04.500
Hey, I told you to use my code name,
Luke Scuzzwalker!


1067
01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:13.000
Kid, listen. Coach says that if you're
not good enough, you should stop trying.


1068
01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.000
- It's okay.
- You tell Tucker I've got a message for him!


1069
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:24.900
Hey! Stripes said to tell you, "Don't
look back, leave it all on the track!"


1070
01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:27.600
Yes! That trick works every time!

1071
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.600
- Good boy! Go, Stripes! Let's go!
- Stripes is starting to get in on the inside.


1072
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.600
Stripes is surging back into contention.

1073
01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:43.600
Trenton's Pride in front, but here comes
Stripes charging along the inside.


1074
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.700
And Stripes is picking them off one by one,
he's coming at Trenton's Pride!


1075
01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.200
- Come on, Stripes!
- Stripes! Come on, Stripes!


1076
01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.200
Stripes is coming in around the inside.

1077
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.100
- Come on, Channing!
- Come on, Channing!


1078
01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:04.400
These two are now locked together!

1079
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.800
Stripes inside,
finding trouble on the rail.


1080
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.700
Behind him, Trenton's Pride.
These two are head-to-head!


1081
01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.500
- Come on!
- Let him run!


1082
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.500
They're head-to-head.
They're inside the final stages!


1083
01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.400
Stripes and Trenton's Pride...

1084
01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.000
- Come on! Yes, yes!
- Come on!


1085
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.500
They're racing up towards the line.
Stripes along the inside.


1086
01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.900
- Let him run!
- Come on, Channing!


1087
01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.700
Come on! Come on! Run!
Move your butt! Come on!


1088
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.900
- Way to go!
- Yeah!


1089
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.600
Yeah!

1090
01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.800
That's my boy right there!

1091
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.800
- Kentucky Open,
he's edged out Trenton's Pride...


1092
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
...and Stripes is the winner
of the Kentucky Open...


1093
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.300
...narrowly beating Trenton's Pride
in a driving finish.


1094
01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.500
I won. I can't believe I won!

1095
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.800
That's my best boy.

1096
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.000
Come on, hurry up!
We're going to the winner's circle!


1097
01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.600
This is his moment, guys. Come on.
He did it!


1098
01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:04.200
Did you see him, Dad? Did you see him?
He almost shot out from underneath me!


1099
01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.300
Your mom would be so proud.

1100
01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.300
And so am I.

1101
01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:20.200
- Hey, Stripey.
- Yeah?


1102
01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:24.100
My father was wrong about you.
You're a great racer.


1103
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.900
Thanks! So are you.
We left it all on the track, didn't we?


1104
01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.700
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.

1105
01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.500
I'll see you at the fence?

1106
01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.000
Yeah. See you.

1107
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:45.100
Great job. You make a lousy gangster,
but you're a stand-up pelican.


1108
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.200
Listen, you mug, I...

1109
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.900
Hey, that's the nicest thing
a very short horse ever said to me.


1110
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:56.000
Then why don't you stick around here.
We make a pretty good team.


1111
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.200
Now, that's an offer I can't refuse.

1112
01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.900
But first there's something
I gotta take care of.


1113
01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.100
I demand an inquiry!

1114
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.400
- Do you hear me?
- Channing, over here!


1115
01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:09.000
That zebra was all over the field!

1116
01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.000
You listen to me,
I want that zebra disqualified!


1117
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.300
Say hello to my little friend.

1118
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.500
And I insist that you pay attention to...

1119
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.500
To me.

1120
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.900
If you'll excuse me.

1121
01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:40.200
I know how you feel, honey.
It happened to me.


1122
01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:45.400
All I can tell you is rinse, lather and repeat.
Rinse, lather and repeat!


1123
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.300
Is there anybody special you'd like
to dedicate today's victory to?


1124
01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.100
Stripes! Stripes! Over here!

1125
01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.900
Where's he going?

1126
01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.900
Okay, Dean, get him.
Get the animals.


1127
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.200
You should be in the winner's circle.

1128
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:15.400
We both should be.
I'd be nothing without you.


1129
01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.300
- Thanks, kid.
- The roses make you look like Elvis.


1130
01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.600
Very Elvis. Very Elvis '75.

1131
01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.100
- I'm so proud of you, Stripes.
- Thanks, Sandy.


1132
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.700
Coming through! Coming through!
Big winner! Coming through!


1133
01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:49.300
Yeah! Catch me, baby, catch me!
Get the good side!


1134
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.700
Hey, boy.

1135
01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.500
- Say cheese!
- Big smile!
