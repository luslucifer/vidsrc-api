00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:09.544
- [Stella] The first time I
learned about America was when I


2
00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:13.448
met a cute little American
boy in kindergarten.


3
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.286
It was my first
impression of America,


4
00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:20.655
and I thought all the
boys in America were cute.


5
00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:26.594
However, the first time I
fell in love with America


6
00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:29.697
was in middle school, when
I watched a famous movie


7
00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:30.999
called High School Musical.

8
00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.370
The movie described daily life
in an American high school.


9
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.776
It showed how American
students study, play, and date.


10
00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:45.713
Since then I started dream
about studying in America.


11
00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:50.418
Then I look at a
newspaper that said,


12
00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:52.420
go to America for
senior high school.


13
00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:44.306
(moody electronic music)

14
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.816
- [Man] I have a strong desire

15
00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:30.952
to be a member of your school.

16
00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:35.089
- [Woman] I must go
to America to study.


17
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.725
- [Woman] Very excited for
a whole new life for me.


18
00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:18.633
- [Chris] In the late

19
00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:21.068
there really started to
be a decline in applicants


20
00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:22.604
for American boarding schools.

21
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:26.007
That's when schools
really discovered


22
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:28.210
the international market.

23
00:03:30.378 --> 00:03:33.381
What had just been a nice
thing to have some diversity


24
00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:36.117
now became essential
for viability.


25
00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:41.456
At that time, the
largest population


26
00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:42.724
was the Japanese students.

27
00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:45.893
That quickly shifted
to the Korean students.


28
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.796
After 2006 when the
floodgates opened from China,


29
00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:52.400
and especially after 2008,
when the economy turned,


30
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.102
China quickly became the largest
population of international


31
00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:57.972
students and that shows
no sign of stopping.


32
00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:09.317
- [Man] It's 1,759.

33
00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:16.891
This is your schedule.

34
00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:40.382
- We were founded in 1792,
which makes us the eighth oldest


35
00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:42.384
private school in
the United States.


36
00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:45.086
We are a co-ed day
and boarding school,


37
00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:47.989
we have about 650
students total.


38
00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:51.125
And most of our students
are day students, about 500,


39
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.794
come from all the towns around.

40
00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:55.797
And our goal is to have about

41
00:04:55.797 --> 00:04:56.598
for each grade.

42
00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:28.630
- [Chris] What are you most
excited about when you think


43
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.198
about coming to America,
to boarding school?


44
00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:35.036
- Chinese school always
has a lot of homework.


45
00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:38.272
- I want give me some free time.

46
00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:41.208
- Chinese education
is exam-oriented.


47
00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.610
We have a lot of homework.

48
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.779
A lot of, a lot of,
a lot of, a lot of.


49
00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.950
- [Harry] There is a teaching
style like critical thinking?


50
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.920
We can talk about our
different opinions?


51
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.490
- Yeah, in the U.S. the
idea is that the students


52
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.925
should begin to
think for themselves.


53
00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:01.295
What do you like to do for
fun, on the weekends, to relax?


54
00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:05.400
- I'm good at basketball.

55
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.070
- [Student] This is my ship
models, this is a small one.


56
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.539
- [Chris] Do you like math
and science, like arts?


57
00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:12.707
- I like math.

58
00:06:12.707 --> 00:06:15.610
- Americans are terrible
at math. (laughs)


59
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.979
It's okay, it's alright,
we're fat and lazy.


60
00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.447
We're not ashamed to admit it.

61
00:06:19.447 --> 00:06:23.818
* Just gotta stand
there and heard me cry *


62
00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:27.955
* It's alright because
I love the way you lie *


63
00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:31.559
* Love the way you
lie (giggles) *


64
00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:32.994
- [Chris] Tell me about
your future goals.


65
00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:35.029
What are some of
your future goals?


66
00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:37.499
- Teacher?
- Really?


67
00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:40.435
What kind of teacher?

68
00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:42.069
- Math teacher.
- Math teacher?


69
00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.771
- Yes, it's interesting.

70
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:44.706
- Yeah.

71
00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:46.408
- My father is a businessman.

72
00:06:46.408 --> 00:06:50.244
I want to study business
to be his good assistant.


73
00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:54.782
Yeah, but I also
want to be an artist.


74
00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:59.787
- I'm, uh, learning
music composition.


75
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.792
I want to join the band.

76
00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:07.395
- [Chris] What do
your parents think?


77
00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:13.635
- My father is a very, a
man, a very kind man, I mean.


78
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:19.306
When he was 18, my grandparent
gave my father 1,000 pounds,


79
00:07:20.475 --> 00:07:23.177
let my father went to
England by himself.


80
00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:24.679
- Wow.
- Yeah.


81
00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:27.849
My father didn't use that

82
00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:32.554
and earned money for his study,
until he came back to China.


83
00:07:32.554 --> 00:07:34.388
- [Chris] So what happened
to the 1,000 pounds?


84
00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:37.925
- He gave it back
to my grandparents.


85
00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:39.861
- Oh, when he comes back home?
- Yes.


86
00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:47.334
- I'm the member of Mifan Mama.

87
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:50.472
A charity organization
which helps Chinese orphans.


88
00:07:50.472 --> 00:07:54.375
My father donate 100,000
Yuan for each year.


89
00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:59.146
They are so happy and they
all hug me and kiss me.


90
00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.915
"Oh, sister, sister," like that.

91
00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:04.285
- [Chris] Wow, okay,
that's good, yeah.


92
00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:06.988
- [Stella] (chuckles)
Why, oh, it's so sad?


93
00:08:06.988 --> 00:08:09.356
- No, that's okay.
- Okay, hi.


94
00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:11.793
Hi, hi.
- Sad is part of life.


95
00:08:11.793 --> 00:08:13.060
We can't always be happy.

96
00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:16.397
What am I looking
for, family name what?


97
00:08:16.397 --> 00:08:17.765
- [Woman] H
-E.

98
00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:19.634
- H?
- Yes.


99
00:08:19.634 --> 00:08:21.268
- [Chris] Oh, there's Harry.

100
00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:24.606
Harry was young,
naive, and quirky.


101
00:08:24.606 --> 00:08:26.340
He had that curious mind.

102
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.676
- [Woman] I think that
Stella's gonna be more of like


103
00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:32.079
a leader or organizer
addition to the community.


104
00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:34.682
You probably got
the same impression.


105
00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:37.284
- Stella came in like
a whirlwind, I had
zero expectations,


106
00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:41.455
and she came in and, yeah,
like a house on fire.


107
00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.091
- When I first read his
application, I was put off.


108
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.261
He is the son of successful
bankers, he expects to make


109
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.131
his first bucket of gold
as soon as he's old enough.


110
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:51.332
- [Chris] Did he use
"bucket of gold?"


111
00:08:51.332 --> 00:08:54.802
- He actually used
"bucket of gold," yeah.


112
00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:57.471
But he didn't come across this
way in the interview at all,


113
00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:59.373
in fact, he said that
while his parents want him


114
00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:01.676
to go into economics,
he would prefer to be


115
00:09:01.676 --> 00:09:04.045
an archaeologist
and study dinosaurs.


116
00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:06.681
- [Woman] They think they're
giving us what we want to hear,


117
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:09.884
and clearly they
don't understand that
what we want to know,


118
00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:13.187
is how they actually
think. (laughs)


119
00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:14.622
- [Chris] Something
closer to the truth.


120
00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:17.124
- Something
resembling the truth.


121
00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:21.529
They think we wanna
hear that they're all,


122
00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:24.532
the kids are so driven and
they wanna be economists,


123
00:09:24.532 --> 00:09:26.934
but obviously
that's not the case.


124
00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:30.872
- You wanna go on?
- Enthusiastic and likable.


125
00:09:30.872 --> 00:09:33.808
Traveled quite a bit,
liked Japan the most.


126
00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:36.944
Likes American pop music,
Green Day and Eminem.


127
00:09:36.944 --> 00:09:38.112
He plays the trumpet.

128
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.515
He plays in the
school drum corps.


129
00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.618
His sister is in
school in Toronto,


130
00:09:43.618 --> 00:09:45.653
studying international
relations.


131
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:50.992
(lively music)

132
00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:50.377
Prodigal.

133
00:11:51.212 --> 00:11:55.917
Profligate. (laughs)

134
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.643
(peaceful pop music)

135
00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:08.022
(bright chime music)

136
00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:28.669
(moody electronic music)

137
00:17:27.114 --> 00:17:30.184
(upbeat piano music)

138
00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:39.360
- Hello!

139
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.528
Today is a very
special day for me.


140
00:17:41.528 --> 00:17:44.431
I'm so happy to receive
the offer from Fryeburg.


141
00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:47.468
It's my ideal school,
my dream comes true.


142
00:17:47.468 --> 00:17:50.237
I will not let you down,
just believe in me.


143
00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:52.839
Now I'm so excited
for everything.


144
00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:55.676
I expect my new school
life, new friends,


145
00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:58.579
new class, I'm
coming, see you soon!


146
00:18:02.883 --> 00:18:05.719
(moody pop music)

147
00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:11.652
(peaceful guitar music)

148
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.707
- My name is Adele, I'm
from South Portland, Maine.


149
00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:16.810
- Hey, I'm Julia,
and I'm from China.


150
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.113
- Hello, my name is Qiao.

151
00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:21.682
- Hi, I'm Jessie.

152
00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:26.587
- I'm Kat, I live in
Chase, I'm from Boston.


153
00:21:26.587 --> 00:21:29.290
- I'm Sara, I'm from Spain.

154
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.156
- Hi, I'm Stella!

155
00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:32.192
Nice to meet you!

156
00:21:33.294 --> 00:21:35.562
I'm junior and I'm in Frye Hall.

157
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.066
- [Woman] Good morning,
and who are you?


158
00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:42.803
- I'm, my last name is
Za-hu, Zee-hu, sorry.


159
00:21:44.338 --> 00:21:46.707
- Z-H-U?
- Z-H-U.


160
00:21:50.277 --> 00:21:51.712
- What country are you from?
- China.


161
00:21:51.712 --> 00:21:54.214
- I'm going to need to
order you health insurance,


162
00:21:54.214 --> 00:21:56.850
unless you have
something different.


163
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.219
Okay, give you that back.

164
00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:02.656
I don't want your I-20,
this is the form I wanted.


165
00:22:02.656 --> 00:22:05.125
It's the most important paper
you'll give anybody today.


166
00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:08.395
You get run over by a car,
nobody's gonna help you,


167
00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:11.932
until I have that,
(laughs) it's America.


168
00:22:38.058 --> 00:22:40.260
- [Harry's Father] One thing
I worry about is that I hope


169
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.597
he will not lost the confidence.

170
00:22:43.597 --> 00:22:47.634
- We always remind the students
too that, to find the things


171
00:22:47.634 --> 00:22:49.035
that they're good at, you know?

172
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.304
The students will
learn from success,


173
00:22:51.304 --> 00:22:53.106
but they'll also
learn from failure.


174
00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:47.994
- What is, seriously?
(student laughs)


175
00:23:47.994 --> 00:23:51.432
(students speak Chinese)

176
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.050
(bluesy guitar music)

177
00:24:58.364 --> 00:25:00.801
- [Student] Woo, I got a hit.

178
00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:10.911
- And you are?
- Bianca.


179
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:13.213
- And where you from?
- China.


180
00:25:13.213 --> 00:25:14.648
- Henry, where you from?
- Harry.


181
00:25:14.648 --> 00:25:17.083
- Harry, I'll get you right,
Harry, where you from?


182
00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:19.119
- China.
- Danielle, where you from?


183
00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:20.053
- Fryeburg.

184
00:25:21.421 --> 00:25:24.290
- I'm part Italian, part
Columbian and part Venezuelan.


185
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.659
- [Teacher] And you're
the only Jamaican here?


186
00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:26.827
- Yeah.
- What city?


187
00:25:28.028 --> 00:25:31.331
- In the center of
China, you don't know.


188
00:25:31.331 --> 00:25:33.233
(students laugh)

189
00:25:33.233 --> 00:25:34.968
- [Teacher] I don't,
that's why I ask questions.


190
00:25:34.968 --> 00:25:37.003
And how was your summer?

191
00:25:37.003 --> 00:25:39.272
- Just hung around,
nothing really.


192
00:25:39.272 --> 00:25:42.676
- Worked, over at
the Oxford House.


193
00:25:42.676 --> 00:25:46.246
- Was that a good job?
- Uh, yeah, keeps you busy.


194
00:25:46.246 --> 00:25:49.282
- Travel and lose
fat. (chuckles)


195
00:25:49.282 --> 00:25:51.151
I lost 20 pounds
during the summer.


196
00:25:52.485 --> 00:25:54.988
- Study.
- Did you study all day?


197
00:25:56.122 --> 00:25:58.058
- Well, six day a week.

198
00:25:58.058 --> 00:26:00.627
- So did you study all summer?
- No, of course not.


199
00:26:00.627 --> 00:26:02.495
(students laugh)

200
00:26:02.495 --> 00:26:04.430
- Day care.
- Was it a good job?


201
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.233
- Yes.
(students giggle)


202
00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:10.436
- [Teacher] So, tell everybody
the population of your city.


203
00:26:10.436 --> 00:26:12.673
- Around eight million?

204
00:26:12.673 --> 00:26:14.207
- Okay.
- What?


205
00:26:14.207 --> 00:26:17.443
- The entire state of Maine
is one million, so his city,


206
00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:19.179
which is near Shanghai,
has eight million.


207
00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:22.082
- [Student] That's New York,
the biggest city in our country


208
00:26:22.082 --> 00:26:24.651
is not even the
biggest city in China.


209
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:25.852
- [Teacher] While you're here,

210
00:26:25.852 --> 00:26:27.353
you're doing something
that's very brave.


211
00:26:27.353 --> 00:26:30.957
You are taking a big risk
to go to another place.


212
00:26:30.957 --> 00:26:34.427
To meet all new people,
it's kind of a scary thing.


213
00:26:34.427 --> 00:26:37.564
Okay, so you all have
a piece of paper.


214
00:26:37.564 --> 00:26:39.299
So I want you to think
for a minute about


215
00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:40.767
what are your goals?

216
00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:44.638
Three things you
wanna do this year.


217
00:26:44.638 --> 00:26:49.576
- Wait, just the new kids?
- Everyone can do it.


218
00:26:50.376 --> 00:26:53.479
(background chatter)

219
00:27:23.644 --> 00:27:25.746
- [Teacher] That was not rude.

220
00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:27.580
Believe me, Stella, that's fine.

221
00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.515
It's cool that you
asked about your grade.


222
00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:31.652
That means that you care,
I gave you an A minus,


223
00:27:31.652 --> 00:27:33.854
but I'm sure you'll
get an A for the class,


224
00:27:33.854 --> 00:27:37.724
like I hardly spend any time
on grades 'cause it's so early


225
00:27:37.724 --> 00:27:41.127
and I didn't really look and
I know you're doing well.


226
00:27:41.127 --> 00:27:42.996
So you probably do deserve an A.

227
00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:44.497
And I think you will get an A.

228
00:27:45.365 --> 00:27:47.801
Those grades that got put out,

229
00:27:47.801 --> 00:27:50.771
they don't go on your
permanent record.


230
00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:52.338
- Okay.
- Okay?


231
00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:53.173
- Thanks.
- Yes.


232
00:27:55.175 --> 00:27:57.811
The worst part of my
job is doing grades.


233
00:27:57.811 --> 00:28:01.782
It's like, doesn't match at
all with what I wanna do here,


234
00:28:01.782 --> 00:28:04.785
is just like make art
with kids. (chuckles)


235
00:28:09.823 --> 00:28:12.325
- In the story of the Outsiders,

236
00:28:12.325 --> 00:28:16.997
there are two distinct groups,
the socs, and the greasers.


237
00:28:16.997 --> 00:28:19.365
The socs are the rich
kids with the cars.


238
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:21.702
They have the nice clothes.

239
00:28:21.702 --> 00:28:24.404
Greasers don't do
very well in school.


240
00:28:24.404 --> 00:28:26.539
Their clothes are different.

241
00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:29.542
They're not necessarily
bad, but different.


242
00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:32.412
Talk to me about
their home life.


243
00:28:32.412 --> 00:28:34.347
Is it like your home life, May?

244
00:28:34.347 --> 00:28:35.515
- [May] I have a happy family.

245
00:28:35.515 --> 00:28:37.217
My mom and dad always around me.

246
00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:38.785
- [Teacher] You
have a happy family.


247
00:28:38.785 --> 00:28:40.253
Your mom and dad are
always around you.


248
00:28:40.253 --> 00:28:43.123
- Yeah and they care about me.
- And they care about you.


249
00:28:43.123 --> 00:28:44.925
Everybody else agree?

250
00:28:44.925 --> 00:28:47.160
- For some strange reason
my parents are still alive,


251
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.962
and my siblings are
smaller than me.


252
00:28:50.296 --> 00:28:51.932
- [Teacher] For some
strange reason your parents


253
00:28:51.932 --> 00:28:54.768
are still alive, should
they be dead already?


254
00:28:54.768 --> 00:28:56.202
- No, I didn't say that.

255
00:28:56.202 --> 00:28:58.571
I just said for some strange
reason they're alive.


256
00:28:59.439 --> 00:29:01.507
- [Teacher] Okay?

257
00:29:01.507 --> 00:29:04.577
So, okay, so, you can
relate a little bit,


258
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:06.046
except what's the difference?

259
00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:09.215
Your parents are
still there, yeah?


260
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.020
Remember the other day,
when we were talking about


261
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.923
judging people by how they look?

262
00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:18.725
What do you notice
about their hair?


263
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.396
Before the end of the book,
I think you will choose


264
00:29:23.396 --> 00:29:26.032
who you would rather
hang out with.


265
00:29:26.032 --> 00:29:27.467
Socs or Greasers?

266
00:29:28.769 --> 00:29:29.602
Bohan.

267
00:29:30.971 --> 00:29:32.739
- I don't know.
(students laugh)


268
00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:34.674
- [Teacher] Just tell me,
who do you think maybe?


269
00:29:34.674 --> 00:29:36.843
Socs or greasers?
- Maybe socs.


270
00:29:36.843 --> 00:29:38.211
- Socs.
- The same.


271
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:39.746
- Socs.
- Pday.


272
00:29:39.746 --> 00:29:42.082
- I don't know,
probably the socs.


273
00:29:42.082 --> 00:29:44.650
- Socs.
- Greasers of course greasers.


274
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.886
- Socs.
- Socs.


275
00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:47.220
- Socs.
- Socs.


276
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.755
- Greasers.
- Socs.


277
00:29:48.755 --> 00:29:50.156
- [Teacher] Socs.

278
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.731
I don't know, I'm thinking
you're not speaking English.


279
00:29:58.731 --> 00:30:00.733
- It just bad pronunciation.

280
00:30:00.733 --> 00:30:03.369
(Bianca laughs)

281
00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:08.374
- [Teacher] Come on,
you know the rules.


282
00:30:11.477 --> 00:30:15.215
(students speaks in Chinese)

283
00:30:17.517 --> 00:30:21.587
(student speaks Chinese)
(Harry laughs)


284
00:30:21.587 --> 00:30:23.990
(horn music)

285
00:31:00.326 --> 00:31:03.864
- So, gentlemen, put that bit
up, put that bit in the index.


286
00:31:03.864 --> 00:31:06.366
Three quarters of an inch is
the thickness of your stock.


287
00:31:06.366 --> 00:31:08.101
What is half of three quarters?

288
00:31:09.469 --> 00:31:12.572
Talked about this, you double
the denominator, right?


289
00:31:12.572 --> 00:31:14.707
Three eighths, right, Harry?

290
00:31:14.707 --> 00:31:16.076
- I don't know. (chuckles)

291
00:31:16.076 --> 00:31:18.078
- [Teacher] You're
gonna hold it like this,


292
00:31:18.078 --> 00:31:20.413
with your hand over the groove,

293
00:31:20.413 --> 00:31:22.415
and work it through
the cutter bit.


294
00:31:22.415 --> 00:31:24.784
(saw buzzes)

295
00:31:48.708 --> 00:31:49.642
- [Teacher] Okay, ready?

296
00:31:49.642 --> 00:31:54.647
Five, six, seven, eight.

297
00:31:55.381 --> 00:31:56.316
Okay, do it again.

298
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.751
Have you fronted a lift before?

299
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:00.220
- No, the first time.
- Okay.


300
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.456
- [Stella] This is the first
time I've gone to cheerleading.


301
00:32:03.456 --> 00:32:05.025
- The lift, okay.

302
00:32:05.025 --> 00:32:08.394
Don't look at the ground, don't
focus on what they're doing.


303
00:32:08.394 --> 00:32:12.232
Just just focus on what
you're gonna do, okay?


304
00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:16.036
Ready?
- Five, six, seven, eight.


305
00:32:16.036 --> 00:32:18.271
One, two.
- Stick it, stick it!


306
00:32:18.271 --> 00:32:19.839
Good, there you go, cradle!

307
00:32:19.839 --> 00:32:21.841
Five, six, seven, eight.

308
00:32:28.581 --> 00:32:31.384
(students laughs)

309
00:32:33.019 --> 00:32:36.656
- [Teacher] Almost a fourth of
the season, guys, it's done.


310
00:32:36.656 --> 00:32:40.260
(students chatter)

311
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.495
Alright, guys, gets
the balls together.


312
00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:48.969
Guys, Harry's in as striker.

313
00:32:49.936 --> 00:32:51.004
Ben, run, that's you!

314
00:32:54.107 --> 00:32:55.141
- Shawn, take it out!

315
00:32:57.877 --> 00:32:58.711
Nice!

316
00:33:02.448 --> 00:33:05.618
- On this grass, man.
- That's alright.


317
00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:12.358
- [Teacher] That's classy, Josh.

318
00:33:12.358 --> 00:33:15.028
(hip-hop music)

319
00:33:26.339 --> 00:33:28.774
* Shorty had them
Apple Bottom Jeans *


320
00:33:28.774 --> 00:33:31.544
* Boots with the fur

321
00:33:31.544 --> 00:33:34.747
* The whole club
was lookin' at her *


322
00:33:34.747 --> 00:33:37.650
* She hit the floor,
next thing you know *


323
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.787
* Shorty got low, low, low,
low, low, low, low, low *


324
00:33:41.787 --> 00:33:46.792
* Them baggy sweat pants and
the Reebok's with the straps *


325
00:34:10.616 --> 00:34:13.953
(peaceful guitar music)

326
00:36:37.163 --> 00:36:39.932
(students laugh)

327
00:37:08.694 --> 00:37:10.830
- [Teacher] Why did Colonel
Shaw's men have to set fire


328
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.398
to the town?

329
00:37:12.398 --> 00:37:14.834
- His superior officer
told him to do it.


330
00:37:14.834 --> 00:37:17.503
- [Teacher] Okay, superior
officer told him to do it.


331
00:37:17.503 --> 00:37:21.307
Colonel Shaw is a colonel,
the other guy is a colonel!


332
00:37:21.307 --> 00:37:24.410
So why is one
colonel able to give


333
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.178
an order to another colonel?

334
00:37:26.178 --> 00:37:27.813
He's been a colonel longer.

335
00:37:27.813 --> 00:37:31.150
So, sort of like,
um, Korean, right?


336
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.319
What's the deal with
Korean students here?


337
00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:38.658
Korean students, do you
have a hierarchy still?


338
00:37:38.658 --> 00:37:40.260
Is there a one head Korean?

339
00:37:41.661 --> 00:37:44.564
Is there a head Korean here
at the Academy anymore?


340
00:37:44.564 --> 00:37:46.766
A boss Korean?
- Um, I don't think so.


341
00:37:46.766 --> 00:37:48.268
- [Teacher] You don't think so
or you're not gonna tell me?


342
00:37:48.268 --> 00:37:49.935
- I think before there were.
- Okay, before there was.


343
00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:51.404
There used to be.
- Yeah.


344
00:37:51.404 --> 00:37:53.773
- [Teacher] And the deal
with that is, if you're born


345
00:37:53.773 --> 00:37:57.510
like three minutes before
me, guess who's in charge?


346
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.579
We used to have a lot
of Japanese students.


347
00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:01.814
They took respect
very seriously.


348
00:38:01.814 --> 00:38:03.316
Those were the bad old days.

349
00:38:03.316 --> 00:38:05.017
I don't think it's like
that anymore, right?


350
00:38:05.017 --> 00:38:06.252
If Kenta doesn't bow
to you, are you gonna


351
00:38:06.252 --> 00:38:08.153
go out in the woods
and break his arm?


352
00:38:09.355 --> 00:38:12.024
Cute little Kenta, no,
right, of course not.


353
00:38:12.024 --> 00:38:14.827
You're gonna say "Hai"
and he's gonna say "Hai"


354
00:38:14.827 --> 00:38:17.763
and everything will
be good, right?


355
00:38:25.305 --> 00:38:26.739
- This is the first
year that I've had a lot


356
00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:28.474
of Asian students in my class.

357
00:38:28.474 --> 00:38:31.311
A lot of Asian students really
didn't take many art classes,


358
00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:33.546
certainly not a
filmmaking class.


359
00:38:33.546 --> 00:38:35.548
So, you're making a documentary.

360
00:38:35.548 --> 00:38:38.718
What's the perceptions
of Asians and Europeans?


361
00:38:38.718 --> 00:38:41.921
Is that what you are
setting out to achieve?


362
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:43.389
- [Students] Yeah.

363
00:38:43.389 --> 00:38:45.190
- So, what are you
finding out so far?


364
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.091
- Respectful.

365
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:46.992
- Intellectual.

366
00:38:46.992 --> 00:38:48.494
- Smart.
- Shy.


367
00:38:48.494 --> 00:38:50.496
- In general, I would say
that the Asian students


368
00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:52.832
stay friends mainly
with the Asian students.


369
00:38:52.832 --> 00:38:55.468
- I have seen a few
Asians with Americans,


370
00:38:55.468 --> 00:39:00.205
but it's more they feel more
comfortable with themselves.


371
00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:02.074
- [Student] But, you know,
everyone goes into the woods


372
00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:03.309
to smoke anyway, so.

373
00:39:06.846 --> 00:39:09.148
- [Student] Everyone, they're
all usually working really,


374
00:39:09.148 --> 00:39:12.818
really hard, I think that's
the biggest difference, but,


375
00:39:12.818 --> 00:39:15.788
you know, everyone goes into
the woods to smoke anyway, so.


376
00:39:30.703 --> 00:39:32.672
- [Student] Felt really bad
actually, I felt really bad


377
00:39:32.672 --> 00:39:34.640
for them because I knew if
I went to a foreign school,


378
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.708
I'd be terrified.

379
00:39:39.779 --> 00:39:41.847
- [Teacher] Is any of this true?

380
00:39:41.847 --> 00:39:43.315
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


381
00:39:43.315 --> 00:39:45.751
- [Teacher] Which is true,
are you hard-working?


382
00:39:45.751 --> 00:39:46.986
- Kinda.

383
00:39:46.986 --> 00:39:49.422
- [Teacher] Just you or
all Asians? (chuckles)


384
00:39:49.422 --> 00:39:51.090
- I think--
- Most of, most.


385
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.191
- I think all of them are true.

386
00:39:53.693 --> 00:39:56.462
But that's not what
we are trying to get.


387
00:39:56.462 --> 00:39:58.030
- [Teacher] What're you
trying to get at, okay?


388
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.665
So, this is the answers
you've gotten so far.


389
00:39:59.665 --> 00:40:01.133
So, what're you trying to get?

390
00:40:01.133 --> 00:40:05.371
- The thing they talk to us
about, from their personal mind.


391
00:40:06.739 --> 00:40:10.309
- So, you think that what
they're saying is not personal?


392
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:15.314
- Maybe they think like, Asian
is too, it's kind of strange,


393
00:40:16.749 --> 00:40:20.586
and when they talk to you,
they don't look at your eyes.


394
00:40:20.586 --> 00:40:23.923
- Why is that?
- 'Cause we are nervous.


395
00:40:23.923 --> 00:40:26.559
- Back in China, everybody
takes the same class,


396
00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:29.595
and everybody is
doing the same test,


397
00:40:31.063 --> 00:40:34.534
so people cannot figure
out what they really like


398
00:40:34.534 --> 00:40:36.101
or who they really are.

399
00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:40.440
- Everyone is the same, yeah.
- Which is stupid.


400
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.208
- If I live in a little town,
I live in Fryeburg Maine,


401
00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:45.811
I've never seen Asians
except, you know, in Fryeburg.


402
00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:49.815
You come to school here, and
they all talk to each other.


403
00:40:49.815 --> 00:40:52.618
- Even if a Chinese and a
Korean sit next together,


404
00:40:52.618 --> 00:40:54.454
they won't talk to each other.

405
00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:58.390
They would like to talk with
others in their own language.


406
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:59.659
- We're afraid.

407
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.661
- [Teacher] Of what?

408
00:41:04.096 --> 00:41:05.831
- Making mistake?

409
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:07.032
- [Teacher] Making mistake?

410
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:13.639
I'm glad you're in my class,
'cause you've taught me a lot.


411
00:41:19.979 --> 00:41:23.382
- Study hall, guys, let's open
your doors, prop 'em open!


412
00:41:23.382 --> 00:41:24.183
Library.

413
00:41:26.085 --> 00:41:27.352
There you go, here's your pass.

414
00:41:27.352 --> 00:41:29.489
- Thanks, thank you.
- You're welcome.


415
00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:33.325
You guys need to get your shoes
out of the hallway, please.


416
00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:34.860
Study hall, let's go, guys!

417
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.596
Guys, let's open up!

418
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.331
You must have work to do.

419
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.802
I'm not sure who I've seen

420
00:41:42.802 --> 00:41:45.004
and who I haven't
seen at this point.


421
00:41:45.004 --> 00:41:47.973
But for some reason, I can't
keep you guys straight.


422
00:41:47.973 --> 00:41:50.242
I can always keep
Johnny straight.


423
00:41:50.242 --> 00:41:52.411
- Why? (laughs)

424
00:41:52.411 --> 00:41:53.913
Why they?

425
00:41:53.913 --> 00:41:55.380
- [Teacher] Why can I not keep
you straight, I don't know.


426
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.249
It's a mental block, you know?

427
00:41:57.249 --> 00:41:59.952
If you ever called me
something besides Miss Gibson,


428
00:41:59.952 --> 00:42:02.087
it's just a mental block.

429
00:42:02.087 --> 00:42:04.824
Actually, I really shouldn't
mix you up anymore.


430
00:42:07.593 --> 00:42:10.663
(bright piano music)

431
00:42:34.687 --> 00:42:36.221
- When the Egyptian
revolution happened,


432
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:38.390
they used this same symbol.

433
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.960
Does that have meaning
for you in China?


434
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.963
If somebody did this, what
would you think it means?


435
00:42:43.963 --> 00:42:47.299
- On the bus.
- On the bus! (laughs)


436
00:42:47.299 --> 00:42:49.168
Riding the bus. (laughs)

437
00:42:49.168 --> 00:42:50.736
That's great.

438
00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:52.672
- [Student] Maybe
it means unite.


439
00:42:52.672 --> 00:42:55.775
- Maybe it means uniting
together, okay, right, yeah.


440
00:42:55.775 --> 00:42:58.277
In America, I think it has
a kind of angry feeling


441
00:42:58.277 --> 00:42:59.712
to do this.

442
00:42:59.712 --> 00:43:01.947
If there's a lot of
people doing it, yeah,


443
00:43:01.947 --> 00:43:06.952
it has that kind of power.

444
00:43:15.394 --> 00:43:18.664
- [Teacher] Gandhi used the
system of get the news out


445
00:43:18.664 --> 00:43:21.033
and share it with the world
and people will change.


446
00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:24.236
I'm especially looking for
stories of nonviolent actions


447
00:43:24.236 --> 00:43:25.170
people did there.

448
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:32.277
- Tank Man?
- Yeah.


449
00:43:34.246 --> 00:43:35.581
- [Teacher] What do you
think we should tell


450
00:43:35.581 --> 00:43:36.816
about this story?

451
00:43:36.816 --> 00:43:39.351
What did he do, what
was the response?


452
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.591
- [Reporter] Heading down the
road was a hazardous business.


453
00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:08.347
- [Teacher] You think he
did it as a news stunt.


454
00:44:08.347 --> 00:44:10.983
So, he told somebody,
"Okay, film me.


455
00:44:10.983 --> 00:44:12.852
"I'm gonna go down
and stop the tanks."


456
00:44:12.852 --> 00:44:14.620
- Yeah.
- Interesting.


457
00:44:15.988 --> 00:44:17.690
- [Reporter] Casualties
were arriving every--


458
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.558
- [Teacher] Do we know
who those people are?


459
00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:26.632
- Students, maybe?
- Yeah.


460
00:44:30.535 --> 00:44:32.872
- [Reporter] The operating
theater was overflowing.


461
00:44:32.872 --> 00:44:34.740
Many of the staff in tears.

462
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.377
- [Teacher] You know what
non-violent actions they did?


463
00:44:38.377 --> 00:44:40.312
- You mean the students?
- Sure.


464
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:52.024
- Okay, a hunger strike,
why would they do that?


465
00:44:57.496 --> 00:44:59.198
- And did it stop
the government?


466
00:44:59.198 --> 00:45:00.833
Did they get what
they wanted changed?


467
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:02.334
- No.

468
00:45:02.334 --> 00:45:07.339
- Uh-huh, so maybe one result
was something they expected,


469
00:45:08.507 --> 00:45:10.242
they wanted, they got
people to join them,


470
00:45:10.242 --> 00:45:12.978
but another result
was unexpected.


471
00:45:12.978 --> 00:45:15.414
(bell rings)

472
00:45:56.889 --> 00:45:59.892
(moody piano music)

473
00:48:16.461 --> 00:48:18.163
- Stella.
- Strong, strong.


474
00:48:18.163 --> 00:48:20.499
- Cheerleader.
- Cheerleader.


475
00:48:21.901 --> 00:48:23.768
- Good job.
- Good job.


476
00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:25.871
- That's good.
- Good job.


477
00:48:34.914 --> 00:48:36.781
- [Cheerleaders] We love,
we love our football team.


478
00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:41.620
L-O-V-E, we love, we
love our football team.


479
00:48:48.994 --> 00:48:53.398
A-T-T-A-C-K, The
Raiders are back.


480
00:48:53.398 --> 00:48:57.536
A-T-T-A-C-K, attack,
attack, attack!


481
00:48:57.536 --> 00:48:59.972
Go, go, bang, bang,
win, win, bang, bang.


482
00:48:59.972 --> 00:49:02.908
Go, bang, win,
bang, go, bang, win!


483
00:49:09.181 --> 00:49:10.782
(spectators applaud)

484
00:49:10.782 --> 00:49:15.087
Hustle, hustle, score,
score, we want more!


485
00:49:15.087 --> 00:49:18.657
Hustle, hustle, score,
score, we want more!


486
00:49:32.204 --> 00:49:34.639
Five, six, seven, eight.

487
00:49:34.639 --> 00:49:38.077
- Here we go, Raiders!
- Come on, Raiders!


488
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.183
(spectators applaud)

489
00:49:45.517 --> 00:49:48.587

00:52:17.536 --> 00:52:20.205

492

* Ever had a dream

493
00:52:29.381 --> 00:52:32.417
* Of watermelon wine

494
00:52:32.417 --> 00:52:34.286
* Yeah

495
00:52:43.162 --> 00:52:44.696
- I'm dying.

496
00:52:44.696 --> 00:52:47.132
* Ain't but three things

497
00:52:47.132 --> 00:52:49.601
* In this world

498
00:52:49.601 --> 00:52:54.606
* That's worth one
solitary doubt *


499
00:52:55.774 --> 00:53:00.612
* And that's old
dogs and children *


500
00:53:02.247 --> 00:53:04.549
* And watermelon wine

501
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:09.221
* A little story that goes
along, but it's a true story *


502
00:53:09.221 --> 00:53:13.925
* He said, women, they
think about they-selves *


503
00:53:13.925 --> 00:53:18.297
* When their menfolk
ain't around *


504
00:53:18.297 --> 00:53:22.334

507

* When I was in
my natural prime *


508
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:43.822

00:53:45.156 --> 00:53:47.726

511
00:53:57.469 --> 00:53:58.303
- Mommy!

512
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:42.734
(moody piano music)

513
01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:42.560

01:04:17.055 --> 01:04:20.124
(moody guitar music)

515
01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:06.570
- [Student] Oh my god,
hi, I love your new hair!


516
01:05:44.142 --> 01:05:45.977
- Are you cheering this year?
- No.


517
01:05:45.977 --> 01:05:47.912
- Oh, how come?
- I don't know.


518
01:05:47.912 --> 01:05:49.780
I've got too much college stuff.

519
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.881
- Too much college stuff?
- Yeah.


520
01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:53.051
- Okay, so, have you thought

521
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:55.586
more about the
schools on your list?


522
01:05:55.586 --> 01:05:56.854
- [Stella] Yeah.

523
01:05:56.854 --> 01:05:59.523
- Are you looking for
teacher certification?


524
01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:00.624
No?
(Stella chuckles)


525
01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:02.560
No, now?
- I don't know.


526
01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.562
- That's a shift for you, okay?

527
01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:07.398
You're interested in business,

528
01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:10.134
and that's what you told
your parents, correct?


529
01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:11.369
- Yeah. (laughs)
- Right?


530
01:06:11.369 --> 01:06:13.471
But I also know that
you want to teach.


531
01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:16.941
And you wanna teach little
people, young people, right?


532
01:06:16.941 --> 01:06:19.077
- [Stella] They think I can
get double majors, you know?


533
01:06:19.077 --> 01:06:22.947
But they're not okay if I just
learn education, to teach.


534
01:06:22.947 --> 01:06:26.384
- [Teacher] Okay and so for
you, is that a conflict for you?


535
01:06:26.384 --> 01:06:30.921
- My parents pay a lot for me
to come to America, and if I


536
01:06:30.921 --> 01:06:34.225
just teach, I don't think I can
get the money back for them.


537
01:06:34.225 --> 01:06:36.827
And I need, get something
for them, you know?


538
01:06:38.196 --> 01:06:40.831
I don't want just come to
America and just learn the same


539
01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:43.067
thing in China, be a teacher.

540
01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:48.072
It's, um, it's my dream,
but it's too common.


541
01:06:50.341 --> 01:06:52.876
- [Teacher] So for you, you
have this understanding,


542
01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:55.413
that you will be needing to
take care of your parents?


543
01:06:55.413 --> 01:06:56.680
- Mm-hm.

544
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.650
- And you can better do
that, not as a teacher,


545
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:01.352
but in the world of business.

546
01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:02.786
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.


547
01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:04.388
So, can you do both?

548
01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:06.224
Can you marry both things?

549
01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:11.162
- Yeah, I was
thinking about, like,


550
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.698
I wanna be a businessman,
businesswoman,


551
01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.470
and when I get older,
maybe I will own a school.


552
01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:23.807
Kindergarten or something,
when I'm getting old.


553
01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:25.343
- Right.

554
01:07:25.343 --> 01:07:26.910
Okay, so while we're here then,

555
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.680
can you open up your
Penn State application?


556
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.685
So, okay, well, are your
parents married and together?


557
01:07:35.853 --> 01:07:37.388
- No, they're not.
- They're not, okay.


558
01:07:37.388 --> 01:07:38.956
So, who is your guardian?

559
01:07:38.956 --> 01:07:40.491
- My mom.
- Okay.


560
01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:42.693
That's been submitted
and payment's submitted,


561
01:07:42.693 --> 01:07:45.696
you've successfully
submitted your common app


562
01:07:45.696 --> 01:07:48.532
to Michigan State University.

563
01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:52.436
(moody guitar and piano music)

564
01:09:03.274 --> 01:09:06.944
- (chuckles) My topic
is Maine blueberry.


565
01:09:06.944 --> 01:09:10.381
Maine actually the origin
of the blueberry plant.


566
01:09:10.381 --> 01:09:14.218
Here I have example
like Rolex in the watch.


567
01:09:14.218 --> 01:09:15.686
When you have this watch,

568
01:09:15.686 --> 01:09:17.855
it means you are a
successful person.


569
01:09:17.855 --> 01:09:21.825
Just like those famous
thing in watch and cars.


570
01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:25.829
I want blueberry become
a star in the fruits.


571
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:28.932
(students laugh)

572
01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:32.970
Yeah, how many of you
ate blueberries before?


573
01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:34.305
Okay, almost everyone.

574
01:09:34.305 --> 01:09:37.408
How many of you
know it is healthy?


575
01:09:37.408 --> 01:09:38.676
Everyone again.

576
01:09:38.676 --> 01:09:42.112
How many of you eat it
at least once a week?


577
01:09:42.112 --> 01:09:44.382
See, there is only two.
(students laugh)


578
01:09:44.382 --> 01:09:49.387
And how many of you are willing
to eat it more than now?


579
01:09:50.588 --> 01:09:53.757
Yes, so this is the
opportunity we have.


580
01:09:53.757 --> 01:09:55.326
- Are there many opportunities

581
01:09:55.326 --> 01:09:57.060
to eat blueberries
right now in China?


582
01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.897
- There are blueberries
in the supermarket,


583
01:09:59.897 --> 01:10:02.065
but it's very expensive,
so I think that's a--


584
01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:04.968
- So, it's a big market.
- Yeah, it's a big market.


585
01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:07.871
(students applaud)

586
01:10:14.345 --> 01:10:15.646
- [Teachers] Read the schools.

587
01:10:15.646 --> 01:10:17.648
Tell me the schools
that you just added.


588
01:10:17.648 --> 01:10:20.918
- [Harry] Boston University,
Ohio State University.


589
01:10:20.918 --> 01:10:22.386
- [Teacher] ow you have
Susquehanna on there.


590
01:10:22.386 --> 01:10:24.622
How did you end up with
that one on your list?


591
01:10:24.622 --> 01:10:26.890
- [Harry] I heard that
some small college


592
01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:30.160
might have a better
elber arts education?


593
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.729
- [Teacher] Liberal arts, mm-hm.

594
01:10:33.197 --> 01:10:35.433
What do you like to study?
- I put three.


595
01:10:35.433 --> 01:10:37.701
- [Teacher] Business,
music, and philosophy, why?


596
01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:39.870
- Well, it's my interest.

597
01:10:41.872 --> 01:10:45.509
- Mm-hm, and when did you
become interested in philosophy?


598
01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:48.512
- Oh, before I came out.

599
01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:51.048
- Before you came to Fryeburg?
- Mm-hm.


600
01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:53.417
- And music,
studying performance?


601
01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:55.419
- Maybe composing.

602
01:10:55.419 --> 01:10:56.987
- Oh.

603
01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:57.821
- Yeah.
- Okay.


604
01:10:59.257 --> 01:11:02.593
- Do you want to hear my idea
for the supplemental essay?


605
01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:04.362
- [Teacher] Sure,
yeah, for which school?


606
01:11:04.362 --> 01:11:06.830
- Wheaton and Boston college.
- Yeah.


607
01:11:19.977 --> 01:11:23.046
(somber piano music)

608
01:14:56.594 --> 01:15:00.263
(lively chatter in Chinese)

609
01:17:00.918 --> 01:17:03.687
- [Chris] In 2015,
for us at Fryeburg,


610
01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:06.423
over half of the international
students are Chinese.


611
01:17:10.594 --> 01:17:13.697
No school's perfect,
no education system
is perfect, but,


612
01:17:15.065 --> 01:17:17.668
most of them really appreciate
that significant change.


613
01:17:19.102 --> 01:17:21.839
A whole way of thinking
opens up for that student.


614
01:17:21.839 --> 01:17:23.073
That's a powerful thing.

615
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.469
- Who's your date?
- Nicola.


616
01:17:52.469 --> 01:17:54.104
- Shoot, she's almost
as tall as me now.


617
01:17:54.104 --> 01:17:56.006
- Yeah, look at my heels.

618
01:17:56.006 --> 01:17:58.375
- Woo!
- Whoa, look at those heels!


619
01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:01.511
Are you gonna be able
to dance in those?


620
01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:22.425
Where's everybody else?

621
01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:46.249
(soulful piano and guitar music)

622
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.912
(lively dance music)

623
01:20:48.912 --> 01:20:53.583
* Turn down for what

624
01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:56.686
* Turn down for what

625
01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:13.937
* Talk dirty to me

626
01:21:13.937 --> 01:21:18.741
* Talk dirty to me

627
01:21:18.741 --> 01:21:20.810
* Talk dirty to me

628
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:24.347
(somber atmospheric music)

629
01:22:14.564 --> 01:22:18.068
- Will you join me, and let's
ask for the Lord's blessing,


630
01:22:18.068 --> 01:22:19.002
on this event.

631
01:22:19.937 --> 01:22:22.072
O gracious heavenly father,

632
01:22:22.072 --> 01:22:25.342
we thank you for this
day that you have made.


633
01:22:25.342 --> 01:22:27.444
We thank you for the time given,

634
01:22:27.444 --> 01:22:30.713
to each of these students
here at Fryeburg Academy,


635
01:22:30.713 --> 01:22:35.152
and we ask for your continued
blessing on this great school.


636
01:22:35.152 --> 01:22:40.057
We thank you for
teachers, mentors,
counselors, and friends.


637
01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:46.063
Encourage their hearts, to
know the hope of your calling


638
01:22:46.063 --> 01:22:48.798
and fill them with your peace.

639
01:22:48.798 --> 01:22:51.234
It is in Jesus' name
that I pray, Amen.


640
01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:57.874
* Our flag was still there

641
01:22:57.874 --> 01:23:02.879
* O say does that
star-spangled *


642
01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:07.985
* Banner yet wave

643
01:23:09.919 --> 01:23:14.924
* O'er the land of the free

644
01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:22.332
* And the home of the brave

645
01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:29.939
(students cheer and applaud)

646
01:23:42.919 --> 01:23:45.855
(students applaud)

647
01:23:54.664 --> 01:23:57.400
(students applaud and cheer)

648
01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:02.405
* From sea to shining sea

649
01:24:04.907 --> 01:24:08.645
* America

650
01:24:08.645 --> 01:24:13.650
* America

651
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:20.390
* America

652
01:24:30.233 --> 01:24:32.535
- [Student] Everyone's
starting to spread out.


653
01:24:32.535 --> 01:24:34.537
Hearing everyone, it's sad.

654
01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:36.506
- [Harry] That's what happen!

655
01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:50.487
- He was a good student,
he was a good student.


656
01:24:50.487 --> 01:24:52.322
Okay, good luck,
keep in touch, okay?


657
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:55.292
- See ya, man.
- What am I gonna do?


658
01:24:55.292 --> 01:24:56.959
I'm not gonna have my
band partner anymore.


659
01:24:56.959 --> 01:24:58.461
- There will be others.

660
01:24:58.461 --> 01:25:00.730
- Yeah but then I'll have
to be partners with Brooke.


661
01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:02.399
You'll have to come
back, you can't graduate.


662
01:25:02.399 --> 01:25:04.534
That's the only solution,
you have to come back.


663
01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:07.837
- There will be new students
coming, remember that?


664
01:25:07.837 --> 01:25:09.839
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, okay.


665
01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:11.074
- Harry's coming back.

666
01:25:11.074 --> 01:25:12.309
- Okay, I will come back
and see you next year.


667
01:25:12.309 --> 01:25:14.311
- Come back in the
fall, good luck.


668
01:25:14.311 --> 01:25:15.678
- Yeah, you too.

669
01:25:15.678 --> 01:25:17.780
- I'll miss you.
- Me too.


670
01:25:18.748 --> 01:25:21.184
(both laugh)

671
01:25:27.524 --> 01:25:30.527
(bittersweet music)

672
01:26:25.282 --> 01:26:27.950
(firework pops)

673
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:23.440
(bluesy music)

674
01:29:00.603 --> 01:29:03.105
(moody music)
