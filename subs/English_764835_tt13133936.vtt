00:00:52.997 --> 00:00:58.033
<i>Focus on it, letting each
breath bring you closer</i>


3
00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:01.696
<i>to a place of peace and restoration.</i>

4
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.371
<i>Picture yourself somewhere you wish to be,</i>

5
00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:10.078
<i>some place from the life you shared.</i>

6
00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:15.985
<i>Feel the warmth it creates,
the memories it provokes,</i>


7
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.383
<i>the wholeness it brings.</i>

8
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160
<i>We can't undo the past,</i>

9
00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:28.427
<i>and the future remains unknown,</i>

10
00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:32.497
<i>leaving us only with each new day.</i>

11
00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:36.138
<i>Adjusting to a new reality takes time.</i>

12
00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:39.009
<i>It is a process, as unique as every-</i>

13
00:02:58.388 --> 00:02:59.388
<i>Have a good day!</i>

Noah!

15
00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:34.620
Noah, come on, wake up!

16
00:03:34.655 --> 00:03:37.557
Come on!
You're going to be late.


17
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.526
<i>I'm sick.</i>

18
00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:45.433
I made you some coffee.

19
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:52.308
You've been up on that phone
all night, haven't you?


20
00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:02.154
Listen, I was thinking we could
do family night tonight.


21
00:04:04.752 --> 00:04:07.687
Movie, dinner?

22
00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:26.145
You know, a chair under
the door would work better.


23
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.379
Hey, come on. Wakey-wakey.

24
00:04:30.778 --> 00:04:32.316
I'm not going.

25
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:34.879
Okay, fine, stay in bed.

26
00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:37.849
'Cause that's really working for you.

27
00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:41.424
Okay, I'm going for a run.
We'll talk about it


28
00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:43.294
when I get back, okay?

29
00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.164
Now please get up.

00:06:06.314 --> 00:06:07.314
Ugh!

32
00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:09.480
This is Amy.

33
00:06:09.515 --> 00:06:11.042
<i>Hi, Amy, it's Greg.</i>

34
00:06:11.077 --> 00:06:12.615
Hey, Greg. What's up?

35
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.023
<i>I'm sorry to bother you
on your day off,</i>


36
00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:16.916
<i>but did that S-corp ever file
an amended return?</i>


37
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:18.555
Yeah, it's in the file.

38
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.392
<i>I can't seem to find it.</i>

39
00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:21.998
<i>You're the one handling
the audit though, right?</i>


40
00:06:22.022 --> 00:06:25.661
Yeah, but could Patricia help you find it?

41
00:06:25.696 --> 00:06:28.004
<i>Yeah, but Patricia gets
lost going to the bathroom</i>


42
00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:29.205
<i>so I don't really want to ask her.</i>

43
00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.999
Right, but she's two
seats down from you, so...


44
00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:35.847
<i>Alright, you're right.
No, you're right.</i>


45
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:36.871
<i>I'll ask her.</i>

46
00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:38.840
<i>Uh...</i>

47
00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:40.039
<i>Mom.</i>

48
00:06:40.074 --> 00:06:42.943
Okay, so I'll see you Monday?

49
00:06:42.978 --> 00:06:45.781
<i>Yeah. Hey, listen,
do you have any interest</i>


50
00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:47.585
<i>in doing lunch together?</i>

51
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.884
Could we talk about it then?

52
00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.732
<i>Oh, no, of course, of course. 
No worries,</i>

53
00:06:51.756 --> 00:06:54.394
<i>no pressure.
You have a good weekend, Amy, okay?</i>


54
00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:55.087
Okay, bye.

55
00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:56.396
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

Hello?

59
00:07:54.885 --> 00:07:57.127
<i>Mrs. Carr, hi. It's Mrs. Fisher
from Emily's school.</i>


60
00:07:57.151 --> 00:07:58.921
Hi, Sandra, is everything okay?

61
00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.868
<i>Everything's fine.
Emily's here in the office,</i>


62
00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:02.639
<i>and she asked if
she could speak to you.</i>

63
00:08:02.663 --> 00:08:04.366
Yeah, sure. Put her on.

64
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.759
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

65
00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:07.027
Hey, sweetie. What is it?

66
00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:09.074
<i>I don't have my dinosaur.
I wanted to bring it</i>


67
00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:10.504
<i>in for the art show.</i>

68
00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:11.769
What dinosaur?

69
00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:13.672
<i>The one with the long neck.</i>

70
00:08:13.707 --> 00:08:15.553
<i>I painted it green at Liam's birthday.</i>

71
00:08:15.577 --> 00:08:16.939
<i>Remember, I named it Princess?</i>

72
00:08:16.974 --> 00:08:21.141
Right, right, okay.
What time's the thing, the art show?


73
00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:22.846
<i>It's after lunch.</i>

74
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:26.883
Okay, I'll go by and pick it up,
and bring it to you


75
00:08:26.918 --> 00:08:28.181
before then, okay?

76
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.182
<i>Okay.</i>

77
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.766
Don't worry, sweetie.
I'll take care of it.


78
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:31.558
<i>Okay.</i>

79
00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:32.691
Now go back to class.

80
00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:33.527
<i>Alright.</i>

81
00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:34.858
Hey, oh, sweetie!

82
00:08:34.893 --> 00:08:35.893
<i>Yeah?</i>

<i>This is Nora, how can I help you?</i>

91
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.715
Yeah, hi, Nora.
My name's Amy Carr.


92
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.454
My daughter, Emily, was in last
week for a birthday party,


93
00:08:59.489 --> 00:09:00.697
and I wanted to
come by and pick up

94
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:02.149
the pottery she painted.

95
00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:03.799
<i>Yeah, definitely,
I'll set it aside.</i>


96
00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:05.526
<i>Do you know which one it was?</i>

97
00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:07.627
The brontosaurus.

98
00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:09.827
<i>Okay, what does it look like?</i>

99
00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:12.467
She painted it green?

100
00:09:12.502 --> 00:09:15.162
<i>Is it the one that flies,
because some of them</i>


101
00:09:15.197 --> 00:09:16.702
<i>can fly, so...</i>

102
00:09:16.737 --> 00:09:20.707
The brontosaurus.
The one with the...


103
00:09:23.074 --> 00:09:26.108
<i>Sorry, the one with the what?</i>

104
00:09:26.143 --> 00:09:28.715
Yeah, sorry, the one with the long neck.

105
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.047
<i>Oh, yeah, got it, got it.
I'm sure I'll find</i>


106
00:09:31.082 --> 00:09:32.322
<i>your daughter's here somewhere.</i>

107
00:09:32.952 --> 00:09:33.786
<i>Mom.</i>

108
00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:34.687
Come on.

109
00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:35.387
<i>And what was her name again?</i>

110
00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:39.055
Yeah, sorry.
Emily's the name.


111
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.540
<i>Emily. Okay, perfect.
I'll put it up by the register</i>


112
00:09:40.564 --> 00:09:41.096
<i>for you.</i>

113
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:42.663
Okay, thanks so much.

114
00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:44.544
<i>Come by anytime, where water and-</i>

115
00:09:46.031 --> 00:09:47.197
Hi, Mom.

116
00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:49.802
<i>I got her, Gary.
How are you doing, honey?</i>


117
00:09:49.837 --> 00:09:52.167
Yeah, I'm jogging.

118
00:09:52.202 --> 00:09:54.972
<i>Oh, she said she's out running.</i>

119
00:09:55.007 --> 00:09:56.644
Can I call you when I'm done?

120
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.085
<i>Well, we'll be boarding soon.</i>

121
00:09:58.109 --> 00:09:59.856
Well, I thought you were coming back Monday.

122
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.210
<i>We were, but Nancy called,
and she wants</i>


123
00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:04.817
<i>to have a celebration
of Peter's life tomorrow.</i>


124
00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:08.656
Oh. Okay.

125
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:09.800
<i>I think it would be good
for you to be around</i>


126
00:10:09.824 --> 00:10:10.790
<i>other people.</i>

127
00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:14.827
Yeah, sure it would be,
but I just, I don't know


128
00:10:14.862 --> 00:10:19.128
how the kids feel.
You know, does this set them back?


129
00:10:19.163 --> 00:10:22.670
<i>It'll be good for them, Amy.</i>

130
00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:24.969
Okay, then.

131
00:10:25.004 --> 00:10:26.311
<i>Well, just think about it, honey.</i>

132
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:27.001
Yeah.

133
00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:27.434
<i>Just think about it.</i>

134
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.369
Yeah, I will.

135
00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:29.069
<i>You can always leave early.</i>

136
00:10:29.105 --> 00:10:31.646
Okay, listen mom, I have to go.

137
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.306
<i>Ask her about the car.</i>

138
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:33.043
<i>What?</i>

139
00:10:33.078 --> 00:10:34.177
<i>The car.</i>

140
00:10:34.213 --> 00:10:35.457
<i>Oh, right. Can you
pick up the car for us</i>


141
00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:38.654
<i>at Reliable Auto Body?
It's ready, but we're getting in</i>


142
00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:39.689
<i>too late to pick it up.</i>

143
00:10:46.898 --> 00:10:47.797
<i>We're boarding, honey.
You take care of yourself,</i>


144
00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:49.995
<i>and don't forget
to get the car, okay?</i>


145
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.634
Yes, I'm getting the car.

146
00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:52.734
<i>Thank you, sweetie.</i>

147
00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:53.635
Bye.

148
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.550
<i>Bye-bye, I love you.
Be safe.</i>


149
00:11:16.353 --> 00:11:18.353
<i>Reliable Auto Body.</i>

150
00:11:18.388 --> 00:11:22.665
Yeah, hi, I'm calling about my parent's car.

151
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.359
<i>What's the last name?</i>

152
00:11:24.394 --> 00:11:25.899
Donnelly.

153
00:11:25.934 --> 00:11:28.033
<i>Yeah, it's all set.
You picking it up?</i>


154
00:11:28.068 --> 00:11:29.346
Yeah, I was going to
be by in a while.

155
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.103
<i>You might want to wait.
The street's blocked off.</i>


156
00:11:32.138 --> 00:11:33.138
Fountain Road?

157
00:11:33.173 --> 00:11:35.205
<i>Yeah, the cops have barricades up.</i>

158
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.789
<i>I'm guessing there was an accident,
I don't know.</i>


159
00:11:36.813 --> 00:11:38.747
<i>Probably some idiot on their phone.</i>

160
00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:43.785
Oh, okay.
I'll be by later then.


161
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.050
<i>We'll be here.</i>

162
00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:46.282
Okay, thanks.

163
00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:56.942
<i>Is someone chasing you?</i>

164
00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.099
What? Hello?

165
00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.307
<i>Oh my God!
It looks like Blair Witch!</i>


166
00:11:59.331 --> 00:12:01.001
Why are you FaceTiming me?

167
00:12:01.036 --> 00:12:03.267
So, Wednesday seems to work best for everybody.

168
00:12:03.302 --> 00:12:05.005
What?

169
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.952
<i>To get together.
We talked about it, remember?</i>


170
00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.844
<i>Wednesday works for everyone.</i>

171
00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:10.109
<i>Susan will be back by then.</i>

172
00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:11.176
Oh, okay.

173
00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:14.157
<i>Reminder, wall guy, 10 a.m. to noon.</i>

174
00:12:14.181 --> 00:12:14.947
Oh.

175
00:12:14.982 --> 00:12:16.720
What, is Wednesday no good for you?

176
00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:19.250
No, I... Sorry, I've just got
this guy coming over


177
00:12:19.285 --> 00:12:20.416
to fix my wall.

178
00:12:20.451 --> 00:12:21.384
<i>What happened to it?</i>

179
00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:23.056
Noah punched a hole in it.

180
00:12:23.091 --> 00:12:25.124
<i>Oh God.
Mackenzie said some kids</i>


181
00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:26.961
have been little dicks to him lately.

182
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.832
Well, she didn't use that word,
but she said they've been mean.


183
00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:32.868
Yeah, it's those toxic apps.
They're awful to each other.


184
00:12:32.903 --> 00:12:35.365
<i>No honey, actually she
said this was at school.</i>


185
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.071
Oh, there too. Great.

186
00:12:38.106 --> 00:12:41.404
See, he doesn't, he doesn't tell me anything.

187
00:12:41.439 --> 00:12:44.242
<i>Look, I just want
to make sure you're all</i>


188
00:12:44.277 --> 00:12:46.310
<i>doing okay, you know,
with the anniversary...</i>


189
00:12:46.345 --> 00:12:48.983
Or, er... I don't, I don't...

190
00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:50.160
I don't know what the right word is.

191
00:12:50.184 --> 00:12:52.789
I just, you know.

192
00:12:52.824 --> 00:12:54.329
So, this is why you're FaceTiming me?

193
00:12:54.353 --> 00:12:57.024
<i>Yes! I'm worried about you.</i>

194
00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:59.026
<i>Is he opening up at all?</i>

195
00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:04.262
Ugh, I don't know. I just feel
like I don't know him anymore.


196
00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:07.597
It's just been a hard year.

197
00:13:07.633 --> 00:13:10.301
I know. I know it has.
But you know, it's really important


198
00:13:10.336 --> 00:13:11.336
you talk to him.

199
00:13:11.371 --> 00:13:15.273
Yeah, I try.
I just honestly think he hates me.


200
00:13:15.308 --> 00:13:18.178
<i>Stop. You know that's not true.</i>

201
00:13:18.213 --> 00:13:20.884
Spend a day in my house
and try telling me that.


202
00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:23.414
I could use a day away from Bob,
don't tempt me.


203
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:26.153
Anyway, point is Noah loves you,

204
00:13:26.188 --> 00:13:30.157
even if he only ever
seldom says it to you.

205
00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:31.391
Very seldom.

206
00:13:31.427 --> 00:13:35.162
<i>Whatever he does,
that's never changing.</i>


207
00:13:35.197 --> 00:13:38.297
<i>You know why?
'Cause you're a great mom, okay?</i>


208
00:13:38.332 --> 00:13:39.397
Okay.

209
00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:41.498
Okay.
Oh, don't forget about Wednesday.


210
00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:43.742
You, me, and Susan. And wine.

211
00:13:43.777 --> 00:13:44.402
Thanks, Heather.

212
00:13:44.437 --> 00:13:45.370
<i>Of course.</i>

213
00:13:45.405 --> 00:13:46.239
Bye.

214
00:13:46.274 --> 00:13:47.405
<i>Bye.</i>

215
00:13:55.855 --> 00:13:57.888
Siri, do not disturb.

216
00:13:57.923 --> 00:14:00.352
<i>Okay, do not disturb turned on.</i>

217
00:15:44.965 --> 00:15:46.998
<i>Hey, it's me.
I'm still at work.</i>


218
00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:48.637
<i>I'm just thinking about you,
that's all.</i>


219
00:15:48.661 --> 00:15:51.431
<i>Thinking I'd try you, no biggie.</i>

220
00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:53.873
<i>Oh, I was going to pick up
a pizza on the way home</i>


221
00:15:53.908 --> 00:15:57.339
<i>for the kids for while you
and I are at dinner.</i>


222
00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.309
<i>And speaking of which,
I made a reservation for 8:30.</i>


223
00:16:00.344 --> 00:16:02.377
<i>That's not too late, right?</i>

224
00:16:02.412 --> 00:16:05.017
<i>I'm sort of the
fence between 7 and 7:30,</i>

225
00:16:05.052 --> 00:16:06.920
<i>but neither were available, so...</i>

226
00:16:06.955 --> 00:16:08.548
<i>Anyway, I'm rambling.</i>

227
00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:11.892
<i>If you talk to Noah,
ask him to text me</i>


228
00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:15.027
<i>what he and Emily want
on their pizza, okay?</i>


229
00:16:15.062 --> 00:16:17.227
<i>I gotta go. Bye. Love you.</i>

230

What's going on?

<i>We don't know yet.
We're finding out.</i>

<i>She's okay. 
We're okay.</i>

253
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.535
<i>Okay, it's not here.
It's over at the high school.</i>


254
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.108
What is? Tell me.

255
00:17:35.143 --> 00:17:35.636

<i>It's bad.
It's really bad.</i>


258

<i>It's Noah.
Please leave a message.</i>

Hey, it's me. Please call
me when you get this.


261
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.552
Something's happening at your school.

262
00:17:50.587 --> 00:17:53.093
I'm on my way home.
Please just call me.


263
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.561
Oh shit.

264
00:18:01.334 --> 00:18:02.233
Come on.

265
00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:04.038
<i>Amy!
Mackenzie's there!</i>


266
00:18:04.073 --> 00:18:05.435
Heather, did you talk to her?

267
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.019
<i>Amy, there's a shooter at the school!</i>

268
00:18:07.043 --> 00:18:08.735
<i>I think somebody's been shot.</i>

269
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:09.969
Oh, my God!

270
00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:11.386
<i>I'm driving there now,
Bob's on his way.</i>


271
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.640
<i>I, I can't believe this!</i>

272
00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:14.026
Did you, did you talk to Mackenzie?

273
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:14.882
<i>I can't reach her.</i>

274
00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:16.677
<i>Oh my God! Get
out of the way! Go!</i>

275
00:18:16.712 --> 00:18:17.712
Okay, okay.

276
00:18:18.715 --> 00:18:20.428
You focus on driving,
I'll try to reach her, okay?


277
00:18:20.452 --> 00:18:21.726
<i>Where is Noah?
Did you talk to him?</i>


278
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.782
<i>Is he up?</i>

279
00:18:22.817 --> 00:18:25.158
No, he's still in bed, still...

280
00:18:25.193 --> 00:18:26.270
<i>Ask him if he's seen Mackenzie.</i>

281
00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:27.435
<i>I can't get in touch with
any of her friends.</i>


282
00:18:27.459 --> 00:18:28.191
He didn't go to school today.

283
00:18:28.227 --> 00:18:29.492
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

284
00:18:29.527 --> 00:18:30.293
He, he stayed home.

285
00:18:30.328 --> 00:18:32.330
<i>What? No, he didn't.</i>

286
00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:33.705
<i>I saw him getting into his
truck with his backpack</i>


287

<i>this morning.</i>

288

Are you sure?

289
00:18:35.932 --> 00:18:37.512
<i>Yeah, Bob's calling.
I have to go.</i>


290
00:18:37.536 --> 00:18:40.273
Wait, don't, don't! Heather!
Stay on the--


291
00:18:40.308 --> 00:18:41.703
Oh, shit!

292

Oh, my God.

293
00:18:45.346 --> 00:18:47.709
<i>It's Noah.
Please leave a message.</i>


294
00:18:47.744 --> 00:18:51.317
Noah, it's me. Call me back as
soon as you get this, please.


295
00:18:51.352 --> 00:18:54.254
Call me back, okay? Call me.

296
00:19:01.791 --> 00:19:03.098

300
00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:13.273
<i>Hello?</i>

00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:15.407
My son's a student at Lakewood High School.

302

There's someone with a gun.

303
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.587
<i>Ma'am, you're saying your son</i>

304
00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:19.818
<i>is a student at Lakewood High School?
Is that right?</i>


305
00:19:19.842 --> 00:19:23.250
<i>Yeah, I can't reach him.
I'm trying to get there.</i>

308

I was jogging.</i>

<i>Can you ask
someone to pick you up</i>


317
00:19:43.503 --> 00:19:44.503
<i>and bring you there?</i>

318
00:19:44.538 --> 00:19:46.416
Please just tell me what's going on.
Is my son,


319
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.276
can you confirm if he went
to school or not, please?

<i>I'm having a hard
time hearing you.</i>


324

<i>Oh my God.</i>

404
00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:27.640
<i>We did speak with
a student a moment ago</i>

<i>who described a situation

<i>People kept running,

<i>and turn off the lights
like we practiced.</i>

<i>he was going to shoot through the door.</i>

<i>Lyft booked. Your driver

<i>Got it, Danny.
Have parents been able</i>


416

able to get in touch with them?</i>


417
00:24:00.863 --> 00:24:02.478
<i>That's the other
part of this.</i>


418

I have to go.


424
00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:14.908
<i>We scheduled between
ten and noon, right?</i>

Are you still there?


428
00:24:22.819 --> 00:24:23.862
<i>Yeah, what did you say?</i>

429
00:24:23.886 --> 00:24:25.853
Are you there, at the house?

430
00:24:25.888 --> 00:24:27.657
<i>Yeah, I'm at your house.</i>

431
00:24:27.692 --> 00:24:29.494
Can you see a white pick up truck?

432
00:24:29.529 --> 00:24:29.989
<i>Can I see a what?</i>

433
00:24:30.024 --> 00:24:31.628
In my driveway?

434
00:24:31.663 --> 00:24:32.462
<i>Uh...</i>

435
00:24:32.497 --> 00:24:34.697
Can you see a white pick up truck?

436
00:24:34.732 --> 00:24:36.468

Yes. My name's Amy Carr,
we spoke before.


440
00:24:48.207 --> 00:24:48.806
<i>Yeah.</i>

441
00:24:48.841 --> 00:24:49.406
About my parent's pick up.

442
00:24:49.442 --> 00:24:50.508
<i>Oh yeah, yeah.</i>

443
00:24:50.543 --> 00:24:54.486
Okay, I was hoping you could
help me with something.


444
00:24:54.521 --> 00:24:58.688
Can you see anything,
what's happening at the school?


445
00:24:58.723 --> 00:25:02.054
<i>Well, listen lady, the cops
have the streets blocked off.</i>


446
00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:05.497
My son's a student at the school.

447
00:25:05.532 --> 00:25:06.698
<i>Oh.</i>

448
00:25:06.733 --> 00:25:10.469
And I'm trying to find out.
Is... Can you go any closer?


449
00:25:10.504 --> 00:25:12.009
Can you check?
I know this is weird.


450
00:25:12.033 --> 00:25:14.144
If it's a risk, don't do it,
but if you could just...


451
00:25:14.168 --> 00:25:15.574
<i>I can't, I can't.</i>

452
00:25:15.609 --> 00:25:17.004
Please!

453
00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.183
<i>It's not that I don't want to,
but a bunch of cops</i>


454
00:25:18.207 --> 00:25:21.481
<i>are right outside.
They told everyone to stay inside.</i>


455
00:25:21.516 --> 00:25:25.210
Right, I just need to know
if he's there or not.


456
00:25:25.245 --> 00:25:27.146
Can you, can you please?

457
00:25:27.181 --> 00:25:28.392
<i>They're not going to tell me.</i>

458
00:25:28.416 --> 00:25:34.186
I get it, I know. But if his
truck's there, I'll know he is.


459
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:35.924
It's a white pick up truck.

460
00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:37.530
<i>Uh...</i>

461
00:25:37.565 --> 00:25:41.666
Please. Please, CJ,
I'm so scared right now.


462
00:25:41.701 --> 00:25:46.704
My dad, Gary Donnelly,
he's been coming to you guys


463
00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:48.706
for years. He knows the owner.

464
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:50.741
Is he there, Chuck?
Chuck, the owner?


465
00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:51.940
<i>Chuck's not in today.</i>

466
00:25:51.975 --> 00:25:54.514
But he would remember my son.

467
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:56.659
My dad's been bringing him by

Okay, it's a white Chevy Silverado.

It's, the number plate is 763...

473
00:26:22.203 --> 00:26:27.107
Those are the first three numbers.
It'll be...


474

It'll be there in the front

475
00:26:33.754 --> 00:26:34.620
<i>Okay.</i>

476
00:26:34.655 --> 00:26:36.623
Please, CJ.
I'm absolutely begging you.


477
00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:39.593
<i>Alright, I'll call you back once I check.</i>

478
00:26:39.628 --> 00:26:41.892
Thank you.
Thank you.

532
00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:38.240
<i>Yeah, it's there, it's there.
A white Silverado.</i>

<i>Take a breath.
Do you know your location?</i>


580

Where the fuck am I?

581
00:30:43.402 --> 00:30:47.437
It looks like Road 138, or 134.

582

<i>Road 134. Do you feel

<i>Good, good.</i>

588
00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:03.090
Let me see, and it's...
What? What?


589
00:31:03.125 --> 00:31:04.091
<i>What's wrong?</i>

590
00:31:04.126 --> 00:31:08.062
Oh my God. It's
saying he's 15 minutes away.

591
00:31:08.097 --> 00:31:09.296
He was right here.

592
00:31:09.332 --> 00:31:10.409
<i>Okay, sit tight.
I'm not going to let you go</i>


593

Stay where you are.</i>


594
00:31:14.202 --> 00:31:17.434
No, I can't.
I have to keep moving.


595
00:31:17.469 --> 00:31:18.578
<i>If you have a ride coming,</i>

596
00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:20.107

597
00:31:20.142 --> 00:31:23.308
No, I can't. I have to,
I need to know he's okay.


598
00:31:23.343 --> 00:31:26.278
<i>I understand, but you need to
stay calm, okay?</i>


599
00:31:28.018 --> 00:31:30.821
<i>Mrs. Carr?
Can you hear me?</i>


600
00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:31.580
<i>Are you okay?</i>

601
00:31:31.615 --> 00:31:32.814
Okay, thank you.

602
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.363

Thank you so much.

604
00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:37.322
<i>Alright, be safe.</i>

605
00:32:05.188 --> 00:32:05.923
Hello?

00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:11.126
<i>Yeah, is this Amy?
Hello?</i>


609
00:32:11.161 --> 00:32:13.458
Yeah, how close are you?

610

612
00:32:17.937 --> 00:32:19.530
No. No, I can't wait that long.

613
00:32:19.565 --> 00:32:22.170
<i>Look, can you meet me at the 138?</i>

614
00:32:22.205 --> 00:32:24.601
<i>It's crazy, the whole town is locked down.</i>

615
00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:26.603
<i>Try to meet me at the 138.</i>

616
00:32:26.638 --> 00:32:29.144
Okay, yeah.
I'm going to head there right now.


617
00:32:29.179 --> 00:32:29.881
<i>Okay.</i>

618
00:32:29.916 --> 00:32:31.047
Okay, thank you.

Oh, come on! Where am I?

621
00:32:59.275 --> 00:33:00.307
Shit!

622
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.088
Shit. Okay.

623
00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:15.995
Okay.

624
00:33:18.424 --> 00:33:20.130
<i>Reliable Auto Body.</i>

625
00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:20.864
Hello.

626
00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:22.099
<i>Hello? Yeah, it's CJ.</i>

627
00:33:22.134 --> 00:33:25.333
CJ, did you see him?

628
00:33:25.368 --> 00:33:28.237
<i>No, but they searched his truck.</i>

629
00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:29.538
What?
What?


630
00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:31.086
<i>Yeah, a bunch of cops
starting looking through it</i>


631
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.670
<i>with the K9.</i>

632
00:33:32.705 --> 00:33:34.474
Why would they search his truck?

633
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:36.047
<i>I don't know.</i>

634
00:33:40.086 --> 00:33:44.220
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

635
00:33:45.124 --> 00:33:47.355
<i>Hey, hello?</i>

636
00:34:03.043 --> 00:34:07.210
<i>He's a good kid. He is.</i>

637
00:34:09.148 --> 00:34:12.512
<i>Why did they search his truck?</i>

638
00:34:12.547 --> 00:34:16.582
<i>He's a good kid.
He's not a bad kid.</i>


639
00:34:16.617 --> 00:34:17.990
<i>He's not.</i>

640
00:34:19.785 --> 00:34:22.291
<i>Noah. Noah.</i>

641
00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:24.491
<i>Why would they be searching his car?</i>

642
00:34:27.694 --> 00:34:30.102
<i>Noah.</i>

643
00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:34.073
<i>Did they search his truck?</i>

644
00:34:34.108 --> 00:34:37.208
<i>He's a good kid.</i>

645
00:34:37.243 --> 00:34:39.639
<i>He's not a bad kid.</i>

646
00:35:13.576 --> 00:35:14.773
<i>Unknown number.</i>

647
00:35:16.117 --> 00:35:17.479
<i>Unknown number.</i>

648
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.779
<i>Unknown number.</i>

649
00:35:22.255 --> 00:35:23.221
Hello?

650
00:35:23.256 --> 00:35:26.059
<i>Mrs. Carr, it's Dedra Wilkinson.</i>

651
00:35:26.094 --> 00:35:29.095
<i>Listen, I have Detective Paulson
from Lakewood PD</i>


652
00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.098
<i>on the line for you, okay?</i>

653
00:35:32.133 --> 00:35:33.332
<i>Go ahead, Detective.</i>

654
00:35:33.368 --> 00:35:36.201
<i>Mrs. Carr, this is Detective Ed Paulson.</i>

655
00:35:36.236 --> 00:35:37.697
<i>There's been a new development.</i>

656
00:35:37.732 --> 00:35:40.271
<i>I need you to pay attention to
what I'm about to ask you,</i>


657
00:35:40.306 --> 00:35:43.604
<i>and I need you to tell me
the truth, understand?</i>


658
00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:46.145
Yes.

659
00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.544
<i>I have some questions
about your son, Noah.</i>


660
00:35:49.579 --> 00:35:52.515
Where is he?

661
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.385
<i>He's still in the building.</i>

662
00:35:56.884 --> 00:35:58.050
What does that mean?

663
00:35:58.085 --> 00:36:00.358
<i>Unfortunately, that's all I can tell you</i>

664
00:36:00.393 --> 00:36:02.096
<i>at this point.</i>

665
00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:04.560
What does that mean?

666
00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.738
<i>I just have some
questions I need to ask you,</i>


667
00:36:06.762 --> 00:36:07.563
<i>Mrs. Carr.</i>

668
00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:10.830
Is he okay?
Is he alive?


669
00:36:10.865 --> 00:36:13.503
<i>We believe he is, yes.</i>

670
00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:17.870
You believe?

671
00:36:17.905 --> 00:36:20.224
<i>Can I ask you a couple
of questions, Mrs. Carr?</i>


672
00:36:23.317 --> 00:36:25.515
Okay.

673
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.617
<i>Do you keep any
firearms in the house?</i>


674
00:36:28.652 --> 00:36:30.487
What?

675
00:36:30.522 --> 00:36:33.424
<i>Guns. Do you keep
any guns in your home?</i>


676
00:36:33.459 --> 00:36:39.430
A couple rifles.
They used to go hunting together.


677
00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:41.267
<i>And where do you keep those?</i>

678
00:36:41.302 --> 00:36:43.368
Downstairs in the basement.

679
00:36:43.403 --> 00:36:44.776
<i>And are these
hunting rifles secure?</i>


680
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.735
They're locked up with a code.

681
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.880
<i>And does your son
know the code, Mrs. Carr?</i>


682
00:36:49.904 --> 00:36:52.245
No. I don't think so.

683
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.291
<i>Just hunting rifles
in the basement,</i>


684
00:36:53.315 --> 00:36:55.578
<i>no high capacity,
or assault weapons, or--</i>


685
00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:57.316
No.

686
00:36:57.351 --> 00:36:58.528
<i>To the best of your knowledge,</i>

687
00:36:58.552 --> 00:36:59.824
<i>has he ordered anything
from a gun retailer recently,</i>


688
00:36:59.848 --> 00:37:01.353
<i>Mrs. Carr?</i>

689
00:37:01.388 --> 00:37:04.323
No. I need to
know if my son's okay.

690
00:37:04.358 --> 00:37:05.632
<i>Do you think
he could have received</i>


691
00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.436
<i>an order without you noticing,
like ammunition?</i>


692
00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.059
No.

693
00:37:08.094 --> 00:37:09.127
<i>Holsters?</i>

694
00:37:09.162 --> 00:37:15.434
No. Why, why are you asking
me these questions?


695
00:37:15.469 --> 00:37:17.546
<i>Does Noah take any
prescription medications?</i>


696
00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:23.805
<i>Mrs. Carr?</i>

697
00:37:25.842 --> 00:37:29.448
<i>You there?</i>

698
00:37:29.483 --> 00:37:31.747
<i>Are you still there, Amy?</i>

699
00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.419
<i>Mrs. Carr?</i>

700
00:37:33.454 --> 00:37:34.684
Lexapro.

701
00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:35.218
<i>Okay.</i>

702
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:39.623
Just ten milligrams.

703
00:37:39.658 --> 00:37:40.525
<i>Have you noticed any changes</i>

704
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.230
<i>in his behavior lately?</i>

705
00:37:42.265 --> 00:37:44.199
He's been upset.

706
00:37:44.234 --> 00:37:47.763
<i>How long do you think
he's been feeling upset?</i>


707
00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:49.435
Since last year.

708
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:50.601
<i>Can you say why?</i>

709
00:37:50.636 --> 00:37:53.241
His father passed away.

710
00:37:53.276 --> 00:37:55.276
<i>How long ago did his father...</i>

711
00:37:55.311 --> 00:37:56.442
A year ago.

712
00:37:56.477 --> 00:37:57.575
<i>A year ago today?</i>

713
00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.643
No, it's Sunday.

714
00:37:59.678 --> 00:38:02.580
<i>Ah. Thank you, Mrs. Carr.</i>

715
00:38:02.615 --> 00:38:05.352
<i>If you hear anything from Noah,
call 911 immediately,</i>


716
00:38:05.387 --> 00:38:07.948
<i>and asked to be patched in
directly to my cell, okay?</i>


717
00:38:07.983 --> 00:38:09.356
<i>Thanks very much.</i>

718
00:39:08.814 --> 00:39:10.363
<i>We know among those,</i>

719
00:39:10.387 --> 00:39:12.365
<i>students say at least one
of them is a teacher,</i>


720
00:39:12.389 --> 00:39:14.589
<i>and we heard from somebody
talking about a teacher</i>


721
00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:16.985
<i>who protected the rest of their class.</i>

722
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.734
<i>Alright, Susanna.
And I want to jump in.</i>


723
00:39:18.758 --> 00:39:23.695
<i>We have confirmation,
that female victim has just died.</i>


724
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:24.663
<i>Oh.</i>

725
00:39:24.698 --> 00:39:26.313
<i>As a result of her injuries.</i>

726
00:39:26.337 --> 00:39:29.404
<i>We have one fatality in this situation,</i>

727
00:39:29.439 --> 00:39:31.736
<i>a female who was actually being treated</i>

728
00:39:31.771 --> 00:39:34.310
<i>at Lakewood Hospital.
We are now getting word</i>


729
00:39:34.345 --> 00:39:39.546
<i>that she has passed from her injuries.</i>

730
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:41.493
<i>It's just the worst, worst fear</i>

731
00:39:41.517 --> 00:39:43.352
<i>when we cover stories like this.</i>

732
00:39:43.387 --> 00:39:46.355
<i>You hear about people being...
One person was shot</i>


733
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.895
<i>in the leg, we heard from
a student out there,</i>


734
00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:49.898
<i>but to hear that somebody
lost their life,</i>


735
00:39:49.922 --> 00:39:53.957
<i>is just devastating,
especially if you're a parent</i>


736
00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:56.498
<i>who can't get in touch
with your daughter.</i>


737
00:39:56.533 --> 00:39:57.840
<i>Very difficult situation,</i>

738
00:39:57.864 --> 00:40:00.964
<i>and extremely heartbreaking
to hear again,</i>


739
00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:04.000
<i>that is one female victim has
been pronounced dead</i>


740
00:40:04.035 --> 00:40:05.035
<i>from her--</i>

741
00:40:37.673 --> 00:40:39.442
My dad is dead.

742
00:40:43.514 --> 00:40:47.714
<i>Two days ago he was here,
and now...</i>


743
00:40:48.783 --> 00:40:50.948
How am I supposed to accept
that a car accident


744
00:40:50.983 --> 00:40:52.653
took him away?

745
00:41:02.665 --> 00:41:10.133
Dad, I love you, and
I miss you so much.


746
00:42:01.824 --> 00:42:04.594
<i>It's Noah. Please leave a message.</i>

747
00:42:04.629 --> 00:42:07.696
Noah, it's me.

748
00:42:09.766 --> 00:42:14.835
Listen, the police... The police
are saying something awful,


749
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:19.070
and I, I don't want to believe them,

750
00:42:19.105 --> 00:42:21.072
but I can't stop thinking...

751
00:42:25.815 --> 00:42:29.048
I know you miss him. I know.

752
00:42:31.283 --> 00:42:34.856
I know I made you angry
about so many things.


753
00:42:39.533 --> 00:42:44.833
And I'm sorry. But I love you, honey,
and I want to help you.


754
00:42:44.868 --> 00:42:49.475
Please let me help you, Noah.

755
00:42:51.941 --> 00:42:54.073
I want to do better with you.

756
00:42:57.617 --> 00:43:02.246
So, if what they're saying is true...

757
00:43:03.183 --> 00:43:06.250
I want you to stop.

758
00:43:06.285 --> 00:43:11.926
Please stop, Noah.
If you're hearing this, please stop.


759
00:43:36.084 --> 00:43:42.022
<i>Please pick up Emily from
school who you land.</i>


760
00:43:54.037 --> 00:43:56.642
<i>Mrs. Carr? Hello?</i>

761
00:43:56.677 --> 00:43:58.270
Hello?

762
00:43:58.305 --> 00:44:01.944
<i>Your number came up.
Everything's still okay here.</i>


763
00:44:01.979 --> 00:44:05.211
<i>The superintendent said that
parents can pick the students up</i>


764
00:44:05.246 --> 00:44:07.356
<i>after six o'clock.
Everyone's in the gymnasium,</i>


765
00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.985
<i>and everyone is okay. Okay?</i>

766
00:44:10.955 --> 00:44:12.625
Right, okay, yeah.

767
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.426
<i>Everything's okay.</i>

768
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:16.761
That's why I was calling. I, uh...

769
00:44:17.665 --> 00:44:18.497
<i>Hello?</i>

770
00:44:18.533 --> 00:44:20.732
Can I speak to Emily?
Is that okay?


771
00:44:20.767 --> 00:44:24.065
<i>Sure, of course.
Hang on a second, let me get her.</i>


772
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.737
<i>Can you get Emily?</i>

773
00:44:29.105 --> 00:44:30.302
<i>Come here.</i>

774
00:44:31.844 --> 00:44:35.274
<i>It's your mama.
Come on.</i>


775
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:36.616
<i>There you go.</i>

776
00:44:37.118 --> 00:44:38.651
<i>Hello?</i>

777
00:44:38.686 --> 00:44:39.817
Hi, sweetie.

778
00:44:39.852 --> 00:44:42.083
<i>Hi, mama.</i>

779
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.658
You okay?

780
00:44:45.693 --> 00:44:48.023
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

781
00:44:48.058 --> 00:44:50.289
Good, good.

782
00:44:50.324 --> 00:44:54.997
Listen, I don't think I can get
there to pick you up,


783
00:44:55.032 --> 00:44:56.702
but Grammy's going to come, okay?

784
00:44:56.737 --> 00:44:58.363
She might be a little late.

785
00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:03.203
<i>Mom, where are you going to be?</i>

786
00:45:03.238 --> 00:45:05.370
I'm not sure.

787
00:45:06.439 --> 00:45:09.243
<i>What's happening at Noah's school?</i>

788
00:45:09.278 --> 00:45:15.084
Shh. I'm trying to find out.
I'm trying to find out.


789
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:16.690
Okay?

790
00:45:17.325 --> 00:45:19.693
<i>Is he okay?</i>

791
00:45:22.093 --> 00:45:23.356
<i>Mama?</i>

792
00:45:23.391 --> 00:45:27.162
He's, your brother's...

793
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.936
I'm going to him right now, okay?

794
00:45:33.874 --> 00:45:35.007
<i>Okay.</i>

795
00:45:35.042 --> 00:45:40.274
Okay. Can you, can you put
Ms. Fisher back on, please?


796
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:41.847
<i>Okay. I love you, mama.</i>

797
00:45:41.882 --> 00:45:43.409
I love you.

798
00:45:43.444 --> 00:45:44.718
<i>Here, Ms. Fisher.</i>

799
00:45:44.753 --> 00:45:47.050
<i>Hello? Mrs. Carr?</i>

800
00:45:47.085 --> 00:45:52.990
Hi, so my mother, she's flying in.

801
00:45:53.025 --> 00:45:54.893
She should be there--

802
00:45:54.928 --> 00:45:56.027
<i>Okay.</i>

803
00:45:56.063 --> 00:45:59.458
Pick up around six, seven, maybe later.
I don't know.


804
00:45:59.493 --> 00:46:02.329
<i>Don't worry, we'll be here.
Don't worry, okay?</i>


805
00:46:02.364 --> 00:46:04.870
<i>Whatever you need, Mrs. Carr.
We've got you.</i>


806
00:46:04.905 --> 00:46:06.872
Thank you.

807
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.876
<i>Oh God.
This is so horrible.</i>


808
00:46:10.911 --> 00:46:13.780
<i>I can't even believe this is happening.</i>

809
00:46:13.815 --> 00:46:15.012
Yeah.

810
00:46:15.047 --> 00:46:16.849
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

811
00:46:17.313 --> 00:46:18.884
<i>Be safe.</i>

812
00:46:35.101 --> 00:46:36.298
<i>Reliable Auto Body.</i>

813
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:37.333
Hello?

814
00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:38.938
<i>Hey, it's CJ again.</i>

815
00:46:40.469 --> 00:46:41.435
CJ?

816
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.404
<i>Yeah.</i>

817
00:46:43.439 --> 00:46:45.208
What's that, what's that noise?

818
00:46:45.243 --> 00:46:47.144
What's happening?

819
00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:49.091
<i>I was finally able to step outside.</i>

820
00:46:49.115 --> 00:46:50.014
<i>Listen, I don't know what's going on,</i>

821
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.853
<i>but the cops are searching more cars.</i>

822
00:46:53.515 --> 00:46:54.548
Why?

823
00:46:54.583 --> 00:46:55.693
<i>I don't know,
but they're doing it.</i>


824
00:46:55.717 --> 00:46:59.387
<i>I see one, two,
they're searching four more cars.</i>


825
00:46:59.422 --> 00:47:00.905
<i>They've got the dogs sniffing them too,</i>

826
00:47:00.929 --> 00:47:02.896
<i>just like with your son's pick up.</i>

827
00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:11.872
Okay. Okay, you call me back
if you see anything else?


828
00:47:11.907 --> 00:47:14.303
<i>I will.</i>

829
00:47:14.338 --> 00:47:16.338
Yeah, that's great. Thanks, CJ.

830
00:47:38.296 --> 00:47:39.262
<i>Hello?</i>

831
00:47:39.297 --> 00:47:40.463
Heather!

832
00:47:40.498 --> 00:47:41.913
<i>Amy? We're on our way
to the hospital.</i>


833
00:47:41.937 --> 00:47:43.233
Oh my God, is Mackenzie okay?

834
00:47:43.268 --> 00:47:45.308
<i>Oh no, she's okay.
She got out.</i>


835
00:47:45.336 --> 00:47:48.074
Okay, did you talk to her?

836
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:49.823
<i>Just for a minute.
She dropped her phone</i>


837
00:47:49.847 --> 00:47:50.513
<i>when she was running.</i>

838
00:47:50.548 --> 00:47:52.210
Did she say anything about Noah?

839
00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:53.827
<i>No, I don't...
I don't know.</i>


840
00:47:53.851 --> 00:47:54.817
You don't know?

841
00:47:54.852 --> 00:47:55.317
<i>You haven't talked to him?</i>

842
00:47:55.353 --> 00:47:56.485
Or you don't know?

843
00:47:56.521 --> 00:47:58.458
<i>I don't know, Amy.
She was so upset.</i>


844
00:47:58.482 --> 00:47:59.593
<i>I didn't get a
chance to ask her anything.</i>

845
00:47:59.617 --> 00:48:01.098
Okay, okay, okay.
Just call me back as soon as you hear


846
00:48:01.122 --> 00:48:02.255
anything, please.

847
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.730
<i>Of course, I will.
I'm sorry, I will.</i>


848
00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.961
Hello? Hello?
Who is this?


849
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.064
Noah!

850
00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:12.362
<i>Help.</i>

851
00:48:12.397 --> 00:48:14.903
Sweetie, are you okay?
I hear you. Are you okay?


852
00:48:15.906 --> 00:48:18.434
I'm here. I'm here.
Tell me what's going on.


853
00:48:18.469 --> 00:48:20.073
<i>He's here.</i>

854
00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:22.009
Who's here? What?

855
00:48:22.044 --> 00:48:22.911
<i>He's here.</i>

856
00:48:22.946 --> 00:48:25.848
Noah, Noah, don't! Shit!

857
00:48:25.883 --> 00:48:27.146
Oh my God!

858
00:48:29.315 --> 00:48:31.359
<i>It's Noah.
Please leave a message.</i>


859
00:48:31.383 --> 00:48:35.088
I lost you, what's happening?
Tell me! Call me back!


860
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.004
<i>It's Noah.
Please leave a message.</i>


861
00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:44.592
<i>I'm coming, coming to get you.</i>

862
00:48:50.974 --> 00:48:52.171
Oh, come on.

863
00:48:55.407 --> 00:48:58.045
Oh God. Oh!

864
00:49:05.384 --> 00:49:07.418
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

865
00:49:07.453 --> 00:49:08.254
Hello?

866
00:49:08.289 --> 00:49:08.892
<i>Mrs. Carr?</i>

867
00:49:08.927 --> 00:49:09.659
Yeah.

868
00:49:09.695 --> 00:49:10.227
<i>It's Dedra Wilkinson.</i>

869
00:49:10.262 --> 00:49:11.994
Yeah, I spoke to him.

870
00:49:12.029 --> 00:49:12.522
<i>Okay.</i>

871
00:49:12.557 --> 00:49:13.723
I spoke to my son.

872
00:49:13.758 --> 00:49:16.658
<i>What did he say to you?
What did he say?</i>


873
00:49:16.693 --> 00:49:19.001
He said, I don't know,
he sounded scared.


874
00:49:19.036 --> 00:49:20.365
He was still inside.

875
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.466
<i>Okay.</i>

876
00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:25.139
And he said someone's here, or coming.
I don't know.


877
00:49:25.174 --> 00:49:27.911
<i>Did he say who?
Did he say who was coming?</i>


878
00:49:27.946 --> 00:49:30.276
It was, "He's here."
That's what he said.


879
00:49:30.311 --> 00:49:32.124
<i>I'm transferring you
to Detective Paulson.</i>


880
00:49:32.148 --> 00:49:32.641
<i>Hold, please.</i>

881
00:49:32.676 --> 00:49:34.181
Okay.

882
00:49:34.216 --> 00:49:35.216
<i>Mrs. Carr?</i>

883
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:36.612
What the hell is happening?

884
00:49:36.647 --> 00:49:38.317
Please, tell me something.

885
00:49:38.352 --> 00:49:39.219
<i>Your son called you?</i>

886
00:49:39.254 --> 00:49:40.254
He said, "He's here."

887
00:49:40.289 --> 00:49:41.496
<i>Okay, did he say anything else?</i>

888
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.091
It's not him, is it?

889
00:49:43.126 --> 00:49:44.202
<i>I'm on with
one of the parents now.</i>


890
00:49:44.226 --> 00:49:45.192
<i>Did you... What?</i>

891
00:49:45.227 --> 00:49:46.426
Why did you search his truck?

892
00:49:46.462 --> 00:49:48.635
<i>We searched his truck
before we confirmed</i>


893
00:49:48.659 --> 00:49:49.825
<i>the suspect's identity.</i>

894
00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.298
Right, but you searched four
more cars after, didn't you?


895
00:49:52.333 --> 00:49:53.343
<i>I need you to listen.</i>

896
00:49:53.367 --> 00:49:55.235
<i>Yes, we did, Mrs. Carr.</i>

897
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.369
It's not my son, is it?

898
00:49:56.405 --> 00:49:58.249
<i>That's what I'm
trying to tell you!</i>


899
00:49:58.273 --> 00:50:00.680
<i>Can you just listen to me
for a minute, please, Mrs. Carr?</i>


900
00:50:00.704 --> 00:50:01.770
Okay.

901
00:50:01.805 --> 00:50:04.244
<i>Your son is not the shooter, okay?</i>

902
00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:09.678
<i>It's not your son.
He's not the shooter.</i>


903
00:50:09.713 --> 00:50:13.616
Why, why did you make me think that?

904
00:50:13.651 --> 00:50:15.530
<i>I can assure you that
wasn't my intention, Mrs. Carr.</i>


905
00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:17.961
Why did you ask me all those things?

906
00:50:17.996 --> 00:50:20.238
<i>Because I had to.
He's still inside the building,</i>


907
00:50:20.262 --> 00:50:21.228
<i>and I had to let you know.</i>

908
00:50:21.263 --> 00:50:22.429
Then get him out.

909
00:50:22.464 --> 00:50:23.542
<i>We're working
on that right now, ma'am.</i>


910
00:50:23.566 --> 00:50:26.971
You got other kids out,
why can't you get mine out?


911
00:50:27.006 --> 00:50:29.171
<i>Mrs. Carr, look,
there are five people</i>


912
00:50:29.206 --> 00:50:31.272
<i>barricaded in the school's chemistry lab.</i>

913
00:50:31.307 --> 00:50:33.384
<i>Your son is one of them, and
so is the suspect, alright?</i>


914
00:50:33.408 --> 00:50:35.672
<i>We have to be very careful.</i>

915
00:50:35.707 --> 00:50:36.806
Who is he?

916
00:50:36.842 --> 00:50:38.422
<i>The suspect?
I can't tell you that.</i>


917
00:50:38.446 --> 00:50:40.248
Well, have you spoken to him?

918
00:50:40.283 --> 00:50:42.096
<i>I haven't personally,
but the Sheriffs Department</i>


919
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.549
<i>negotiation team has,
and the longer we can maintain</i>


920
00:50:44.584 --> 00:50:46.265
<i>contact with him,
the better our chances.</i>


921
00:50:46.289 --> 00:50:47.255
Is he a student?

922
00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:48.334
<i>I can't tell you that either.</i>

923
00:50:48.358 --> 00:50:50.995
<i>Look, Mrs. Carr, 
I understand that you want--</i>

924
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.260
At least tell me that much.

925
00:50:52.295 --> 00:50:53.328
<i>I--</i>

926
00:50:53.363 --> 00:50:54.028
If he's a student,
at least let me think he has


927
00:50:54.064 --> 00:50:56.198
a fighting chance against him.

928
00:50:56.233 --> 00:50:58.332
<i>Please, Mrs. Carr.</i>

929
00:50:58.367 --> 00:51:00.202
<i>Look, he's not a student, okay?</i>

930
00:51:02.701 --> 00:51:04.734
Then who is he?
Why is he doing this?


931
00:51:04.769 --> 00:51:06.120
<i>We're working
as fast as we can</i>


932
00:51:06.144 --> 00:51:07.110
<i>to try to figure out--</i>

933
00:51:07.145 --> 00:51:08.189
How does someone like that
have so many guns?


934
00:51:08.213 --> 00:51:10.278
<i>I don't know,
but he's got them.</i>


935
00:51:10.313 --> 00:51:11.774
Then tell me what you do know.

936
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:13.787
<i>Our negotiator's

We're doing everything--</i>


938
00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:18.187
Yeah, well, he doesn't have your
negotiator's son, does he?


939
00:51:18.222 --> 00:51:21.454
He has mine, and
an AR fucking 15 weapon,

940
00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:24.292
and whatever else you said.
Do something about it!

00:51:32.368 --> 00:51:35.402
there are five people in the lab, right?

945
00:51:35.437 --> 00:51:36.636
You said that.

946
00:51:36.672 --> 00:51:38.350

to do something for me, please.


949
00:51:49.617 --> 00:51:52.255
Those trucks, those cars in the parking lot

950

<i>Yeah, they're kind of far.</i>

954
00:51:59.528 --> 00:52:04.333
Yeah, can you maybe take
a photo and zoom in?

955
00:52:04.368 --> 00:52:06.764
Can you do that, check the database,
the state database?


956
00:52:06.799 --> 00:52:07.598
<i>Huh?</i>

957
00:52:07.633 --> 00:52:11.142
You're an inspection station, right?

958
00:52:11.177 --> 00:52:16.279
You can check who,
whose cars are registered to.


959
00:52:16.314 --> 00:52:16.913
<i>Oh yeah, yeah.</i>

1095
00:57:25.088 --> 00:57:26.154
Shit, hello.

1096
00:57:26.189 --> 00:57:28.727
<i>Hello, hey. 
It's your Lyft driver.</i>

1097
00:57:28.762 --> 00:57:30.993
Where are you?
I'm just getting to the 138.


1098
00:57:31.028 --> 00:57:32.742
<i>I just turned off Hill Bridge Road.</i>

1099
00:57:32.766 --> 00:57:34.744
Yeah, I'm not on Hillcrest,
I'm on the 138.


1100
00:57:34.768 --> 00:57:36.801
<i>Is that you?</i>

1101
00:57:36.836 --> 00:57:38.539
Yes, it's Amy, but I--

1102
00:57:38.574 --> 00:57:41.674
<i>No, I mean in the grey sweatshirt,
is that you?</i>


1103
00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:43.841
Yes! Yes, that's me!

1104
00:57:52.456 --> 00:57:53.653
Please, let's go, fast!

1105
00:58:01.124 --> 00:58:03.630
<i>Destination, 
Lakewood High School.</i>

1106
00:58:03.665 --> 00:58:06.127
Estimated arrival, 15 minutes.

1107
00:58:12.773 --> 00:58:13.904
Come on, Greg.

1108
00:58:31.496 --> 00:58:39.062
One, two, three. Maybe ten. Ten.

1109
00:58:39.097 --> 00:58:44.936
Is that enough?
Will you listen then?


1110
00:58:44.971 --> 00:58:49.611
And that, that place, the school,
it's just there.


1111
00:58:49.646 --> 00:58:51.206
That's it, that's why.

1112
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:57.553
I remember them laughing,
like I didn't know,


1113
00:58:57.588 --> 00:59:01.590
like I wasn't there or something.

1114
00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:06.089
I'm sick of waiting.
After today, you'll listen.


1115
00:59:06.124 --> 00:59:09.829
And once you see, you'll listen.

1116
00:59:42.127 --> 00:59:46.196
Hello? Are you there?

1117
00:59:47.265 --> 00:59:48.231
Robert?

1118
00:59:48.266 --> 00:59:49.969
<i>Who is this?</i>

1119
00:59:52.138 --> 00:59:54.105
My name's Amy Carr.

1120
00:59:56.714 --> 00:59:59.209
<i>Are you the police?</i>

1121
00:59:59.244 --> 01:00:01.552
No, I am not the police.

1122
01:00:01.587 --> 01:00:03.620
<i>They keep calling me.</i>

1123
01:00:04.155 --> 01:00:04.852
They called me too.

1124
01:00:04.887 --> 01:00:07.085
<i>Why?</i>

1125
01:00:11.355 --> 01:00:14.224
Because my son is there with you.

1126
01:00:14.259 --> 01:00:17.766
They thought he was the one doing this.

1127
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.133
Is he okay?

1128
01:00:21.168 --> 01:00:23.079
<i>You're lying, you're the police.</i>

1129
01:00:23.103 --> 01:00:25.675
No, I swear I'm not the police.

1130
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:27.072
<i>Then who are you?</i>

1131
01:00:27.107 --> 01:00:31.208
I'm his mom, and I'm worried.

1132
01:00:35.313 --> 01:00:37.346
He's a good boy.

1133
01:00:37.381 --> 01:00:43.792
He's a good kid, all of them,
they're good kids.


1134
01:00:43.827 --> 01:00:46.696
Now, I know, I
know you're angry and scared,

1135
01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:53.131
and hurting, but none of this is
going to make it any better.


1136
01:00:57.335 --> 01:01:00.204
<i>I want this to stop.</i>

1137
01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:01.909
I want it to stop too.

1138
01:01:04.717 --> 01:01:08.983
Tell me how I can help you.
Tell me what I can do.


1139
01:01:10.217 --> 01:01:14.087
Shit!
Shit!


1140
01:01:19.193 --> 01:01:20.203
<i>The mailbox is full,</i>

1141
01:01:20.227 --> 01:01:21.336
<i>and cannot accept any messages--</i>

1142
01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.700
Shit!

1143
01:01:34.813 --> 01:01:35.846
Come on.

1144
01:01:35.881 --> 01:01:36.714
<i>The mailbox is full--</i>

1145
01:01:36.749 --> 01:01:37.948
Shit!

1146
01:01:37.984 --> 01:01:39.224
<i>and cannot accept any messages.</i>

1147
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.058
Come on.

1148
01:01:52.094 --> 01:01:53.138
Mom, Mom, I don't have long.

1149
01:01:53.162 --> 01:01:55.997
<i>You're lying.
You're the police.</i>


1150
01:01:56.032 --> 01:01:58.142
I hope this isn't the last time
I'll be able to say it to you,


1151
01:01:58.166 --> 01:01:59.671
but I love you.

1152
01:01:59.706 --> 01:02:02.773
<i>Who are you?</i>

1153
01:02:02.808 --> 01:02:05.336
Please, save this video if
anything happens to me.


1154
01:02:24.061 --> 01:02:26.798
<i>Excuse me, miss.
Are you okay?</i>


1155
01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:28.800
Yeah, I'm fine.

1156
01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:32.067
<i>No caller ID.</i>

1157
01:02:37.074 --> 01:02:38.007
Hello?

1158
01:02:38.042 --> 01:02:38.674
<i>This is Detective Paulson.</i>

1159
01:02:38.709 --> 01:02:40.812
<i>How'd you get that number?</i>

1160
01:02:40.847 --> 01:02:42.080
I, uh...

1161
01:02:42.115 --> 01:02:47.082
<i>You just put all those kids at risk.
Your kid!</i>


1162
01:02:47.117 --> 01:02:49.051
He worked at the cafeteria.

1163
01:02:49.086 --> 01:02:49.986
<i>Do you know him?</i>

1164
01:02:50.021 --> 01:02:51.251
No, no,

1165
01:02:51.286 --> 01:02:53.319
<i>Then how'd you get the number?</i>

1166
01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:56.289
<i>Mrs. Carr, how did you get his number?</i>

1167
01:02:56.324 --> 01:02:58.060
Does that matter right now?

1168
01:02:58.095 --> 01:02:59.743
<i>It matters if you're
not telling me something,</i>


1169
01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:00.811
<i>if you're providing him assistance.</i>

1170
01:03:00.835 --> 01:03:02.911
You heard me on the call.
Did it sound like I was


1171
01:03:02.935 --> 01:03:04.134
assisting him?

1172
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:06.277
<i>Listen to me, I want
you to listen to me</i>


1173
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:08.268
<i>very carefully, Mrs. Carr.</i>

1174
01:03:08.303 --> 01:03:11.810
<i>Do not call him again, okay?</i>

1175
01:03:11.845 --> 01:03:13.504
He says it wants it to stop.

1176
01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:15.154
<i>Not the way you think he does.</i>

1177
01:03:15.178 --> 01:03:17.079
<i>Please, let us do our jobs.</i>

1178
01:03:17.114 --> 01:03:18.213
He has my son.

1179
01:03:18.249 --> 01:03:20.852
<i>That's right.
And the likelihood of us</i>


1180
01:03:20.887 --> 01:03:24.152
<i>getting him out of there safely
just got a lot more complicated.</i>


1181
01:03:24.187 --> 01:03:29.091
<i>Please, do not interfere, Mrs. Carr.
No more calls.</i>


1182
01:03:45.176 --> 01:03:47.352
<i>You're seeing SWAT moving in now,</i>

1183
01:03:47.376 --> 01:03:48.542
<i>into the building.</i>

1184
01:03:48.577 --> 01:03:50.190
<i>There's something
definitely happening.</i>


1185
01:03:50.214 --> 01:03:51.447
<i>On the Sky Cam, Danny.</i>

1186
01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:53.490
<i>SWAT's there, SWAT is
inside the high school,</i>


1187
01:03:53.514 --> 01:03:58.253
<i>moving in what appears to be
some sort of tactical formation.</i>


1188
01:03:58.288 --> 01:03:59.120
<i>Now, I'm told that the governor</i>

1189
01:03:59.156 --> 01:04:01.289
<i>has offered Lakewood PD assistance</i>

1190
01:04:01.324 --> 01:04:02.657
<i>from the National Guard.</i>

1191
01:04:02.692 --> 01:04:06.459
<i>It seems a terrible
day is finally reaching some--</i>


1192
01:04:08.463 --> 01:04:12.069
Excuse me, do you have
a charger for an iPhone?


1193
01:04:12.104 --> 01:04:14.203
Sorry, just an Android.

1194
01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:34.256
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

1195
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:38.194
Yes, can I speak with Dedra Wilkinson, please?

1196
01:04:38.229 --> 01:04:40.559
<i>Mrs. Carr?
Is that you, Amy?</i>


1197
01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:41.934
Hey.

1198
01:04:41.969 --> 01:04:44.134
<i>Yes, hello, it's me. Hi.</i>

1199
01:04:44.169 --> 01:04:45.202
Hi.

1200
01:04:45.237 --> 01:04:47.566
<i>You okay?
How are you holding up?</i>


1201
01:04:47.601 --> 01:04:49.139
Not great.

1202
01:04:49.174 --> 01:04:52.241
<i>Are you still on the road?</i>

1203
01:04:52.276 --> 01:04:55.915
Yeah, but I'm in a car now.

1204
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:59.281
<i>That's good. What can
I help you with?</i>


1205
01:04:59.316 --> 01:05:02.989
Just didn't want to be alone.

1206
01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:06.289
<i>I understand.
I'm here if you need me to be.</i>


1207
01:05:06.324 --> 01:05:08.291
How is this happening?

1208
01:05:08.326 --> 01:05:09.435
<i>You've just
got to hang in there.</i>


1209
01:05:09.459 --> 01:05:11.393
<i>You've been staying so strong.</i>

1210
01:05:11.428 --> 01:05:13.626
I have, but I'm not. I'm not.

1211
01:05:13.661 --> 01:05:15.870
<i>You are, Amy.
You're doing everything</i>


1212
01:05:15.905 --> 01:05:18.598
<i>you need to be doing for your son.</i>

1213
01:05:18.633 --> 01:05:22.041
No, I'm barely holding on.
I shouldn't have made him go.


1214
01:05:22.076 --> 01:05:23.142
I shouldn't.

1215
01:05:23.177 --> 01:05:25.308
<i>Listen, this is not your fault, Amy.</i>

1216
01:05:25.343 --> 01:05:28.080
Yeah, it's mine. I should have
just let him stay home,


1217
01:05:28.115 --> 01:05:29.181
and left him alone.

1218
01:05:29.216 --> 01:05:31.545
<i>You did what any
other mom would do.</i>


1219
01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.515
<i>You got your son up when he
couldn't get up on his own.</i>


1220
01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:36.517
<i>You got him on his feet,
and made sure</i>


1221
01:05:36.552 --> 01:05:38.585
<i>he got to where he needed to be.</i>

1222
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.996
<i>Because he's your child, and
because you love him.</i>


1223
01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:47.462
<i>Simple as that. You didn't know
today was going to be like this.</i>


1224
01:05:47.497 --> 01:05:50.905
<i>Nobody did. 
That's my point.</i>

1225
01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.140
<i>And he knows that, Mrs. Carr.
He's not blaming you.</i>


1226
01:05:55.175 --> 01:05:59.045
<i>He's holding on to you right now.</i>

1227
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.542
<i>He's holding on to that love.</i>

1228
01:06:26.339 --> 01:06:28.185
<i>I might just be a
voice on the other end</i>


1229
01:06:28.209 --> 01:06:30.242
<i>of this line,
but I'm here for you.</i>


1230
01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:36.281
<i>I'm praying for you, Mrs. Carr.
For you and everyone else.</i>


1231
01:06:36.316 --> 01:06:37.249
Thank you.

1232
01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:38.580
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1233
01:06:42.124 --> 01:06:43.530
<i>Amy, are you still there?</i>

1234
01:06:43.554 --> 01:06:46.060
Oh God. I think it's the detective calling.

1235
01:06:46.095 --> 01:06:48.194
<i>I'll let you go.</i>

1236
01:06:48.229 --> 01:06:49.362
But...

1237
01:06:49.397 --> 01:06:51.142
<i>You have to
take that call, Mrs. Carr.</i>


1238
01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:52.466
Will you stay on the line?

1239
01:06:52.501 --> 01:06:54.739
<i>Yes, yes, now answer.
I promise I'll stay on the line,</i>


1240
01:06:54.763 --> 01:06:57.566
<i>just please, answer the call.</i>

1241
01:06:57.601 --> 01:06:59.139
Oh God, okay.

1242
01:07:03.013 --> 01:07:03.979
Are you still there?

1243
01:07:04.014 --> 01:07:04.672
<i>I am.</i>

1244
01:07:04.707 --> 01:07:05.740
<i>Who's that?</i>

1245
01:07:05.775 --> 01:07:06.819
<i>It's Dedra Wilkinson, 
Detective.</i>

1246
01:07:06.843 --> 01:07:10.315
<i>I'm the 911 dispatcher
you spoke with before.</i>


1247
01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:11.416
Please, just...

1248
01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:14.418
<i>Mrs. Carr, the suspect has cut off</i>

1249
01:07:14.453 --> 01:07:15.518
<i>contact with us.</i>

1250
01:07:17.225 --> 01:07:21.128
What does that mean?
Is he okay, my son?


1251
01:07:21.163 --> 01:07:24.032
<i>We don't know.
I have Sargent Brant</i>


1252
01:07:24.067 --> 01:07:27.233
<i>from the crisis negotiation
unit on the line.</i>


1253
01:07:27.268 --> 01:07:28.434
<i>Mrs. Carr?</i>

1254
01:07:28.469 --> 01:07:31.270
Oh God. I'm sorry, I didn't mean,
I didn't mean to make


1255
01:07:31.305 --> 01:07:33.305
things worse, I was
just trying to reach him.

1256
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.274
<i>I understand.
I understand that,</i>


1257
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:39.608
<i>and I wouldn't characterize
it that way at all.</i>


1258
01:07:39.643 --> 01:07:43.349
Why is this happening?
Why is he doing this?


1259
01:07:43.384 --> 01:07:45.549
<i>We don't know.
But I do know</i>


1260
01:07:45.584 --> 01:07:47.518
<i>he's in possession of multiple firearms,</i>

1261
01:07:47.553 --> 01:07:51.786
<i>and he's demonstrated a
willingness to use them.</i>


1262
01:07:51.821 --> 01:07:55.097
<i>Like Detective Paulson said,
we've lost communication</i>


1263
01:07:55.132 --> 01:07:58.298
<i>with the suspect,
and we're running out of time.</i>


1264
01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:01.070
<i>We need your help.</i>

1265
01:08:01.105 --> 01:08:04.568
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1266
01:08:04.603 --> 01:08:07.109
<i>You were able to make
contact with the suspect,</i>


1267
01:08:07.144 --> 01:08:09.540
<i>and you were able to remain
on the line with him.</i>


1268
01:08:09.575 --> 01:08:11.476
For like ten seconds.

1269
01:08:11.511 --> 01:08:12.818
<i>Which is ten seconds longer</i>

1270
01:08:12.842 --> 01:08:15.777
<i>than what we're getting out of him now.</i>

1271
01:08:15.812 --> 01:08:16.911
No, no.

1272
01:08:16.947 --> 01:08:18.124
<i>We're not asking
you to play negotiator,</i>


1273
01:08:18.148 --> 01:08:22.487
<i>not at all. Okay, we just need
to you to distract him</i>


1274
01:08:22.522 --> 01:08:24.819
<i>long enough for SWAT to reach
the chemistry lab.</i>


1275
01:08:26.856 --> 01:08:29.098
What if I say the wrong thing?

1276
01:08:29.133 --> 01:08:31.177
<i>We'll guide you
through all of it, okay?</i>


1277
01:08:31.201 --> 01:08:32.508
<i>We're going to tell you what to say.</i>

1278
01:08:32.532 --> 01:08:35.104
No, I could say something that makes it--

1279
01:08:35.139 --> 01:08:37.403
<i>It's okay, Amy.
It's okay.</i>


1280
01:08:37.438 --> 01:08:39.416
<i>If we're doing this,
we have to go now.</i>


1281
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.583
<i>Do you have access to a
second phone line, Mrs. Carr?</i>


1282
01:08:41.607 --> 01:08:45.774
No, I, I don't have another phone,
I'm in a car.


1283
01:08:45.809 --> 01:08:48.381
<i>Hey, here you go.</i>

1284
01:08:49.615 --> 01:08:50.515
Thank you.

1285
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:51.649
You're welcome.

1286
01:08:51.685 --> 01:08:53.133
<i>Mrs. Carr, did you
get another phone?</i>


1287
01:08:53.157 --> 01:08:53.789
Yeah.

1288
01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:55.322
<i>Okay, stand by.</i>

1289
01:08:55.357 --> 01:08:56.423
Okay.

1290
01:08:56.458 --> 01:08:57.898
<i>We're going to
connect you to Robert.</i>


1291
01:09:02.332 --> 01:09:03.443
<i>Okay, we'll be listening in,</i>

1292
01:09:03.467 --> 01:09:05.729
<i>and here on the other line
if you need us, alright?</i>


1293
01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:13.484
<i>SWAT team is standing
by at the north end</i>


1294
01:09:13.508 --> 01:09:15.739
<i>of the school.</i>

1295
01:09:15.774 --> 01:09:16.807
He's not picking up.

1296
01:09:16.842 --> 01:09:17.851
<i>He might have
put down his phone.</i>


1297
01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:19.512
<i>Just don't hang up.</i>

1298
01:09:25.157 --> 01:09:26.255
Robert.

1299
01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:27.290
<i>Hello?</i>

1300
01:09:27.324 --> 01:09:29.159
Hello, it's Amy Carr.

1301
01:09:29.194 --> 01:09:30.160
<i>She's on with him now.</i>

1302
01:09:30.195 --> 01:09:31.733
<i>You're the one
who called before?</i>


1303
01:09:31.757 --> 01:09:34.725
Yes, that's right.

1304
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.793
<i>Alright, now ask
him if he's okay.</i>


1305
01:09:36.828 --> 01:09:39.367
Is everything, is everything okay, Robert?

1306
01:09:39.402 --> 01:09:43.503
Are you okay?
Do you need medical help?


1307
01:09:43.538 --> 01:09:45.571
<i>No.</i>

1308
01:09:45.606 --> 01:09:47.286
<i>Ask about the students now.</i>

1309
01:09:47.311 --> 01:09:51.346
Does anyone... 
Is everyone else okay?

1310
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:52.842
<i>Not everyone.</i>

1311
01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:54.855
<i>Victim reported,
we've got a possible casualty.</i>


1312
01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:57.583
Listen, Robert, I'm very
worried about my son.


1313
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:00.223
Is he okay?

1314
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:05.459
Is that him?
Is that Noah?


1315
01:10:05.494 --> 01:10:06.693
Please tell me.

1316
01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:08.803
<i>Try to respond to what
Robert is saying to you.</i>


1317
01:10:08.827 --> 01:10:10.497
Robert, is he still with you?

1318
01:10:10.532 --> 01:10:11.565
<i>Yes.</i>

1319
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.774
<i>Don't draw attention to your son.</i>

1320
01:10:12.798 --> 01:10:14.171
<i>Focus on the suspect.</i>

1321
01:10:14.206 --> 01:10:15.568
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>

1322
01:10:15.603 --> 01:10:17.207
Oh, God.

1323
01:10:17.242 --> 01:10:18.769
<i>They keep moving.</i>

1324
01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:20.310
<i>I told them, no moving.</i>

1325
01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:22.741
Who's moving, Robert?
Stay with me, stay with me.


1326
01:10:22.776 --> 01:10:23.852
<i>You need to listen.</i>

1327
01:10:23.876 --> 01:10:25.513
<i>All of you, no more moving!</i>

1328
01:10:25.548 --> 01:10:26.855
<i>Just keep him calm.
Tell him you can help.</i>


1329
01:10:26.879 --> 01:10:27.378
<i>Listen!</i>

1330
01:10:27.413 --> 01:10:28.413
I want to help you.

1331
01:10:28.447 --> 01:10:29.280
<i>SWAT has entered the east wing.</i>

1332
01:10:29.315 --> 01:10:32.619
Oh my God, please hurry, please hurry.

1333
01:10:32.654 --> 01:10:33.521
<i>Who were you talking to?</i>

1334
01:10:33.556 --> 01:10:34.288
What?

1335
01:10:34.324 --> 01:10:35.156
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

1336
01:10:35.191 --> 01:10:37.822
You, you.
I'm talking to you, Robert.


1337
01:10:37.857 --> 01:10:41.265
I'm talking to you.
Can you hear me?


1338
01:10:42.598 --> 01:10:44.400
<i>I hear people coming.</i>

1339
01:10:44.435 --> 01:10:45.301
<i>You're a liar!
You're the police!</i>


1340
01:10:45.336 --> 01:10:46.908
What? Who's... No!
I'm not the police.


1341
01:10:46.932 --> 01:10:47.865
<i>Who's out there?
Who's out there?</i>


1342
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.570
I swear, I'm not the police.

1343
01:10:49.605 --> 01:10:50.912
<i>Okay, just keep him engaged.</i>

1344
01:10:50.936 --> 01:10:51.869
<i>We need some more time.</i>

1345
01:10:51.904 --> 01:10:53.222
<i>Hey! Where's the other kid?</i>

1346
01:10:53.246 --> 01:10:54.357
<i>The kid with the brown hair?</i>

1347
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:55.554
<i>SWAT team have
reached the forth floor.</i>


1348
01:10:55.578 --> 01:10:56.676
<i>Where did he go?!</i>

1349
01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:57.974
<i>Tell me where he is!</i>

1350
01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.780
Shit!

1351
01:11:00.815 --> 01:11:01.146
<i>Amy, you need to call him back.</i>

1352
01:11:01.182 --> 01:11:02.114
Oh my God.

1353
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:03.427
<i>Stand down.
We lost him.</i>


1354
01:11:03.451 --> 01:11:07.357
<i>SWAT, stand down, we have lost
engagement with the suspect.</i>


1355
01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:09.059
<i>The mailbox is full,</i>

1356
01:11:09.094 --> 01:11:09.920
<i>and cannot accept any messages.</i>

1357
01:11:09.955 --> 01:11:10.955
Shit!

1358
01:11:16.863 --> 01:11:18.698
<i>Mrs. Carr, did we lose you?</i>

1359
01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:19.864
No, I'm here.

1360
01:11:22.572 --> 01:11:24.506
Oh my God!
Oh my God, he's calling.


1361
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:25.749
<i>Is the shooter calling you, Mrs. Carr?</i>

1362
01:11:25.773 --> 01:11:27.707
No, it's Noah.
He's FaceTiming me.


1363
01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:29.423
<i>Mrs. Carr, is your son with the shooter?</i>

1364
01:11:29.447 --> 01:11:32.778
Noah! Honey, are you okay? Noah?

1365
01:11:32.813 --> 01:11:34.780
Mom, it's me.

1366
01:11:34.815 --> 01:11:38.256
I can't see you.
I can hear you though.


1367
01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:39.224
Where are you?

1368
01:11:39.259 --> 01:11:41.920
I got away.
I'm hiding in the French room.


1369
01:11:41.955 --> 01:11:43.922
Okay, I'm coming to get you.

1370
01:11:43.957 --> 01:11:46.595
I'm coming to get you, honey.
You stay where you are.


1371
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:47.262
I love you, baby.

1372
01:11:47.298 --> 01:11:48.300
<i>I love you too.</i>

1373
01:11:48.335 --> 01:11:49.400
I love you so much.

1374
01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:50.612
<i>Get SWAT in there now!</i>

1375
01:11:50.636 --> 01:11:53.635
The police are coming, okay?
We're going to get you out.


1376
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:55.813
<i>Where's the other kid?
Tell me where he is.</i>


1377
01:11:55.837 --> 01:11:57.606
I'm scared.

1378
01:11:57.641 --> 01:11:59.443
I'm here. I'm here,
I'm here, baby.


1379
01:11:59.478 --> 01:12:01.313
<i>Tell me where he is!</i>

1380
01:12:01.348 --> 01:12:02.743
Okay, okay, I'm sorry!

1381
01:12:02.778 --> 01:12:04.041
What's happening? Oh my God!

1382
01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:05.142
What's happening?

1383
01:12:05.177 --> 01:12:06.188
<i>SWAT's breaching
the chemistry lab.</i>


1384
01:12:06.212 --> 01:12:07.389
Oh my God! No!
They're going to the wrong room!


1385
01:12:07.413 --> 01:12:10.685
The French classroom
They're not in the chemistry lab!


1386
01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.763
<i>Order them down, now.</i>

1387
01:12:11.787 --> 01:12:12.753
Please, hurry up!

1388
01:12:12.788 --> 01:12:13.788
<i>Next room, now!</i>

1389
01:12:28.001 --> 01:12:30.441
No! Noah!

1390
01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:32.476
Oh my God!

1391
01:12:32.511 --> 01:12:34.379
I'm coming!

1392
01:12:36.713 --> 01:12:37.844
No!

1393
01:12:41.388 --> 01:12:42.948
Ma'am!

1394
01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:45.390
Stand back.
Everybody, stay back.


1395
01:14:08.003 --> 01:14:09.112
<i>Stand by, stand by.</i>

1396
01:14:09.136 --> 01:14:10.520
<i>We've got more people coming out.</i>

1397
01:14:10.544 --> 01:14:11.939
<i>We've got more coming out.</i>

1398
01:14:20.148 --> 01:14:22.654
Noah!
Noah!


1399
01:14:22.689 --> 01:14:23.689
Noah!

1400
01:14:24.691 --> 01:14:25.789
Mom!

1401
01:14:25.824 --> 01:14:26.592
<i>Noah!</i>

1402
01:14:26.627 --> 01:14:27.627
Mom!

1403
01:14:28.156 --> 01:14:29.156
Noah!

1404
01:14:30.092 --> 01:14:30.926
Mom!

1405
01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:31.961
Noah!

1406
01:14:44.843 --> 01:14:48.878
Okay, are you okay?
Oh my God.


1407
01:14:56.052 --> 01:14:57.788
I love you, I love you.

1408
01:15:36.631 --> 01:15:37.806
<i>Hi, this is Amy.</i>

1409
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:41.063
<i>Leave a message, 
I'll get back to you.</i>

1410
01:15:41.098 --> 01:15:43.571
<i>Mrs. Carr, it's Detective Paulson.</i>

1411
01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:46.838
<i>I was told that you and
your son were reunited,</i>


1412
01:15:46.873 --> 01:15:51.238
<i>and I'm really glad to hear that.</i>

1413
01:15:51.273 --> 01:15:57.112
<i>I also wanted to thank you.
I know what we asked you to do</i>


1414
01:15:57.147 --> 01:15:59.785
<i>wasn't easy, but...</i>

1415
01:16:01.151 --> 01:16:02.151
<i>You were great.</i>

1416
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:05.923
<i>Amy, it's Greg. I just
wanted to check back in.</i>


1417
01:16:05.958 --> 01:16:09.091
<i>I hope your son's okay,
and you're okay too.</i>


1418
01:16:09.126 --> 01:16:11.962
<i>We just landed,
and heard what's going on.</i>


1419
01:16:11.997 --> 01:16:14.635
<i>Is Noah alright, is he with you?</i>

1420
01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:16.967
<i>We're on our way to pick up Emily--</i>

1421
01:16:17.002 --> 01:16:19.805
<i>Hey, Mrs. Carr, it's CJ.</i>

1422
01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.104
<i>I hope you and your son got reunited,</i>

1423
01:16:22.139 --> 01:16:25.580
<i>and you know, your parents' car
is ready whenever you want--</i>


1424
01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:26.848
<i>Hey, it's Heather.</i>

1425
01:16:26.883 --> 01:16:31.949
<i>I am so glad that Noah's okay,
and you're all home safe.</i>


1426
01:16:31.984 --> 01:16:34.688
<i>We love you guys, and
we're here if you need us</i>


1427
01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:38.560
<i>for anything.
Come by, call me.</i>


1428
01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:41.288
<i>Whatever you want, I'm here.</i>

1429
01:16:41.323 --> 01:16:44.225
<i>I hope you're holding each other
a little tighter today.</i>


1430
01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:48.229
<i>I know we are. I love you. Bye.</i>

1431
01:17:49.062 --> 01:17:50.292
Thank you, Mom.

1432
01:17:52.032 --> 01:17:56.100
Love you, hon. There's pancakes
when you're ready.


1433
01:18:11.084 --> 01:18:13.095
<i>A moment too
horrific and too tragic</i>


1434
01:18:13.119 --> 01:18:16.318
<i>has unfortunately happened again.</i>

1435
01:18:16.353 --> 01:18:19.058
<i>Former graduate of Lakewood High School,
Robert Ellis,</i>


1436
01:18:19.093 --> 01:18:20.829
<i>stormed the school Friday morning,</i>

1437
01:18:20.864 --> 01:18:23.766
<i>taking hostages for several
hours before a SWAT team</i>


1438
01:18:23.801 --> 01:18:26.001
<i>was able to free a group of
students held captive</i>


1439
01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.133
<i>in a second floor classroom.</i>

1440
01:18:28.168 --> 01:18:30.102
<i>I just, I saw kids running,</i>

1441
01:18:30.137 --> 01:18:34.909
<i>and I was running too,
and then Ms. Dwyer told us</i>


1442
01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.780
<i>to go into a classroom
and turn off the lights</i>


1443
01:18:37.815 --> 01:18:41.718
<i>like we practiced.
But we just heard more shots.</i>


1444
01:18:41.753 --> 01:18:43.687
<i>And we were afraid he
was going to shoot</i>


1445
01:18:43.722 --> 01:18:48.120
<i>through the door,
but he just kept going.</i>


1446
01:18:48.155 --> 01:18:52.322
<i>So, we started to run away,
and we just ran...</i>


1447
01:18:55.932 --> 01:18:58.328
Hey, it's me, Noah.

1448
01:18:58.363 --> 01:19:03.707
Day 100 of doing this, posting this.

1449
01:19:03.742 --> 01:19:08.877
Day I think 107 since what
happened at my school,


1450
01:19:08.912 --> 01:19:12.441
our school, if...
Yeah, you know.


1451
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:19.217
Hearing a lot of
what you've had to say,

1452
01:19:19.252 --> 01:19:25.124
it's inspired me to keep doing this,
to stand up.


1453
01:19:25.159 --> 01:19:29.161
Today seems kind of like a milestone,
I guess.


1454
01:19:29.196 --> 01:19:32.494
A hundred days of these videos.

1455
01:19:32.529 --> 01:19:35.299
A lot's changed in that time.

1456
01:19:35.334 --> 01:19:42.813
For me, my life feels like
things are finally starting


1457
01:19:42.848 --> 01:19:46.212
to get better.

1458
01:19:46.247 --> 01:19:51.118
It's not gone, it'll never be gone.

1459
01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:56.486
I want to keep active, I want to
keep talking to everybody


1460
01:19:56.521 --> 01:20:01.359
because this has to stop.
It should have stopped before.


1461
01:20:01.394 --> 01:20:02.976
Kids shouldn't have to go
to school and worry


1462
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.903
about this happening to them.

1463
01:20:06.938 --> 01:20:08.839
And that's why I'm going to keep doing

1464
01:20:08.874 --> 01:20:11.842
whatever I can to help, you know.

1465
01:20:11.877 --> 01:20:15.879
'Cause I know some of you can't.

1466
01:20:17.015 --> 01:20:18.519
And I'm going to keep talking
about how wrong this is


1467
01:20:18.543 --> 01:20:21.918
because there's no other way to say it.

1468
01:20:21.953 --> 01:20:24.888
And that's why I won't stay quiet,

1469
01:20:24.923 --> 01:20:27.319
and I hope you won't either.
