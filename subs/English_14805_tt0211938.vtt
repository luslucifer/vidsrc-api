1
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.050
Quiet night, boys?

2
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.550
Yes, sir.

3
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.250
Gentlemen, we owe a quarterly.

4
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.150
Vault 23, encryption download.

5
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.050
Loaded.

6
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.350
Level five. Sonic, please.

7
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.050
Stable.

8
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.650
Motion.

9
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.350
Stable.

10
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.950
Status check, please.

11
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.750
All secure.

12
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.550
Excellent.

13
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.450
Carry on, gentlemen.

14
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
- Come on. Come on!
- What're you doing, man?


15
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.150
All right. All right, we're here.

16
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.250
What restaurant is this?
Where the front door at?


17
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.850
We go in the back.
It's like VIP, you know?


18
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.750
Only cool people go in the back,
like Madonna...


19
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.050
and Dennis Rodman
and Gary Coleman.


20
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.550
It's real controversial stars
coming in this place.


21
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.950
All right.

22
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.950
I'm not doing it.

23
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.850
All we gotta do is knock this off.

24
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.650
We'll get a couple of grand.
I been casing this joint for months.


25
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.650
Look.

26
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.950
You been casing it
and got one picture?


27
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.250
Film is expensive. Look at that.

28
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.950
Shrimp? You on parole and you here
trying to go back for stealing shrimp?


29
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.950
Not shrimps, baby. Prawns.

30
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.650
What the fuck is a prawn?

31
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.050
A prawn is bigger than shrimp. You
ever order a jumbo shrimp cocktail?


32
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.850
And they real big
like they been working out?


33
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.850
Like they on steroids?
That's prawns.


34
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.850
Eating one prawn,
that's like five or six shrimp.


35
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.350
Yeah, right.
I'm going back to the truck.


36
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.450
Fredo did the same thing to Michael
in The Godfather.


37
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.650
"Fredo, don't ever go
against the family.


38
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.750
Don't disrespect me and my father.
Get the fuck out here!"


39
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.650
You're deviating.

40
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.050
Give me a second.

41
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.750
We don't have a second.

42
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.250
Go back to the truck.

43
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.450
I'll finish up here.

44
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.250
Glove.

45
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.350
Ninety seconds. Perfect.

46
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.350
Send down the lift.

47
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.050
Yeah.

48
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.050
I don't think so.

49
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.750
What? What are you talking about?

50
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.450
The first conversation that
we ever had. No fucking guns!


51
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.050
You listen to me, Jaster.

52
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.150
You send down that fucking lift!

53
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.150
- Fuck you, you freak show!
- What are you doing?


54
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.050
No!

55
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.550
Wait.

56
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.650
Wait!

57
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.650
Crazy motherfucker!

58
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.750
No!

59
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.050
Stop!

60
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.450
...frigid weather conditions
continue to pound the New York area.


61
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.550
You fucking nuts?

62
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.350
No.

63
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.950
I'm fine.

64
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.950
Thanks for your concern.

65
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.250
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- Hold on.


66
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.650
He's really disrespecting
my speed right now.


67
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.050
He's about to bite me in the ass.
Disrespecting your speed?


68
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.850
Where the hell they get a Doberman?

69
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.350
Where's a nice, slow rottweiler
when you need him?


70
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.550
You cased it for months
and didn't see a 200-pound dog?


71
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.050
They was puppies when I saw them.
All right.


72
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.350
On three, you go right, I'll go left.

73
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.150
Fuck that. I go wrong all the time.
I'm going right.


74
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.750
Okay, brother, whatever.

75
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.850
One, two, three, break out.

76
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.050
Gotta hurry.
Yeah, what you want now, huh?


77
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.250
One-on-one.
It's me and you, baby. Me and you.


78
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.550
Well, it can just be you.
It can just be you.


79
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.450
How long does it take to
get these out of development?


80
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.350
Because, you know, I been working
on my little portfolio.


81
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.250
You're lucky I pulled my hamstring.

82
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.550
Y'all would still be chasing me.

83
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.850
You're saying that your partner
was a midget on a skateboard?


84
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.250
Midgets is taking over. They took
over this playground where I live.


85
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.950
They got this whole little
midget underworld.


86
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.250
It's crazy.

87
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.950
They squeezing us out because
they selling everything half-price.


88
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.450
I'm innocent, yo.

89
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.350
Oh, innocent, huh?

90
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.850
Man, if you didn't have a gun,
I'd whup your ass.


91
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.950
Where'd you get this then, huh?
A cocktail party?


92
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.650
- What do you got?
- We got nothing.


93
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.750
Both shot in the back of the head,
execution-style.


94
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.350
Could be a 9 mil or a.38.
I couldn't find any empty shells.


95
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.150
They died about three hours ago,
I would say.


96
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.450
All right, listen up.

97
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.450
My name is Edgar Clenteen.

98
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.650
I'm the chief investigator, Special
Projects Unit, U.S. Treasury Dept.


99
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.950
This is my crime scene.

100
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.350
And you all are contaminating it.

101
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.550
We got two young men here...

102
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.550
executed inside one of
the most secure rooms on earth.


103
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.750
So whatever you find, I don't care
what it is, you bring it to me.


104
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.150
I will not have anyone
fucking up this investigation.


105
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.850
Now get out of here.

106
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.450
Let Forensics do their work.

107
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.550
Go on. Get out.

108
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.850
I got one.

109
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.350
We ran an AFIS match
on the fingerprint.


110
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.350
John Delano Jaster, a heavy-equipment
operator with two prior felonies.


111
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.750
- Where the hell do I find him?
- He's at Rikers.


112
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.250
- Who's this?
- Well, who is this?


113
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.350
John Jaster, asshole. You're in
my house. Put my wife on the phone.


114
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.950
Oh, hey, Mr. Jaster.
Your wife stepped out.


115
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.250
She told me to get the phone...

116
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.650
in case this was you
and, you know, it was.


117
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.850
Who are you?

118
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.550
I'm just here fixing the heat. Is
there a number she can reach you at...


119
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.450
or a message or something?
She has been worried sick about you.


120
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.350
- You fix the heat, huh?
- Yeah, that's right.


121
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.050
Let me tell you something.

122
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.550
Lady said you'd never go for it, but
you'd save yourself a lot of grief...


123
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.450
you put in a new thermostat.

124
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.650
Don't worry about my thermostat.
Tell my wife that I'm in Rikers.


125
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.350
Oh, you don't say?

126
00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.550
Just tell her to get her ass
down here and get me out.


127
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.150
Don't worry about it, pal.
I'll be sure to tell her.


128
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:06.450
Jerk-off.

129
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.150
Oh, that was your husband.

130
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.650
He wants you to
get him out of jail.

131
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.750
But you've had a difficult day.

132
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.650
Why don't I do it?

133
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.750
Good morning, sir.

134
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.450
I'd better not be wasting my time.

135
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.450
Wooly, what do you got?

136
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.450
Jaster's in a holding cell
with an Alvin Sanders.


137
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.350
Some guy they picked up on a petty
theft heist for stealing shrimp.


138
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.550
- Shrimp?
- Shrimp.


139
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.750
That's pure nerve gas. You can use
that shit for weapons and shit.


140
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.950
You burned the hairs out my nose.

141
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.250
I see why they arrested you.
They gotta protect the public.


142
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.850
I'm sorry. I suppose
you smell like daffodils.


143
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.350
You should be mad at your ass.
You and your ass should get a divorce.


144
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.850
- I don't feel good.
- Well, that makes two of us.


145
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.950
Did you eat some shit on a half shell?
Yeah, grunt. Get it out.


146
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.850
See, that's...
Yo, what's up? What's up, man?


147
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.550
It's my heart.

148
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.550
Yo, guard!
We need a doctor in here right now!


149
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.850
- What's up?
- The pills. Get the pills.


150
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.750
Hold on. I'm coming, I'm coming.

151
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.950
All right. All right, just relax.
You all right?


152
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.250
I'm gonna get somebody
for you, all right?


153
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.050
- Alvin.
- Yeah.


154
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.250
- Is that your name?
- Yeah.


155
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.250
You probably know me. The shrimp
heist, but it was actually prawns.


156
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.150
- If I don't make it...
- Oh, come on with that.


157
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.650
Can you just listen?
This is important.


158
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.050
I need you to get
a message to my wife.


159
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.950
Tell her...

160
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.650
that she should go
to the Bronx Zoo.


161
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.750
- Yeah. The Bronx Zoo. All right.
- Please.


162
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.650
Tell her, "There's no place
like home".


163
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.450
What about Toto...

164
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.650
and, you know,
the yellow brick road?


165
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.750
What kind of pills you taking?

166
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.150
Are you through.

167
00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.950
You get that message to her.

168
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.150
I'll make it worth your while.

169
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.950
Cool, cool.
Now, what if you do make it?


170
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.550
You still break a brother off?
I need some change in my pocket.


171
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.250
Damn, he already shit all over...

172
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.450
Hands over your head and don't move.

173
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.350
Drag this piece of crap upstairs.

174
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.150
Dude was already sick. He was about
to die. What's wrong with you?


175
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.850
Don't treat him like that.

176
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.250
Don't treat him
like an animal like that.


177
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.250
Y'all push him around. If it was me,
I wouldn't take that bullshit.


178
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.750
Are you a doctor?

179
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.450
We're ready here, sir.

180
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.850
You been working out, huh?

181
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.050
Sir?

182
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.350
Yeah, you better talk to him, boy.

183
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.350
You lucky these bars here.
You don't know who you fooling...


184
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.650
Okay, you coming back.

185
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.050
I'll be right up here
getting my sleep.


186
00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.550
I'll whup your ass.

187
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.350
You don't know who you just
grabbed up on. I'm a gangster.


188
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.650
I see you coming.

189
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.150
Come here where there's no light,
I'll whup you.


190
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.450
You got your boys
with your billy sticks.


191
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.850
I'm Alvin, baby, king of the seafood.
They know me around these corridors.


192
00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:22.950
Explain it to me, John.

193
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:27.550
How do you steal 40 million in gold
and not have the cash to make bail?


194
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.050
I don't know
what you're talking about.


195
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.550
I'm out of aspirin.

196
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.650
Could you get me some?

197
00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.650
Chewable.

198
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.050
How'd it happen?

199
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.150
How do you pull
the heist of the decade...


200
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.050
and get busted for a DWl?

201
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.050
What kind of man...

202
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.050
goes out celebrating...

203
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.350
after he pops two boys
in the back of the head?


204
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.150
Look, I didn't....

205
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.950
You're not hanging that on me.

206
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.950
They were on the floor...

207
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.650
facedown.

208
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.650
It was an execution, pure and simple.

209
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.150
No guns, man.

210
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.950
Look, I'm a contractor.
I'm no fucking shooter!


211
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.350
Then who?

212
00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.250
Just give me the names.

213
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.150
A name. It was just....

214
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.050
There was just one other guy.
It was me and him.


215
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.850
- Bullshit. Bullshit!
- One guy. One guy!


216
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.450
I swear it.

217
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.550
Computer is what this guy's got.

218
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.350
He's got the whole government wired.

219
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:03.950
Who?

220
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.950
Come on, Jaster, tell me who.

221
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.950
Give me the goddamn name, Jaster.
Just give me a name.


222
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.550
Please, listen to me.

223
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.750
Get me a doctor.

224
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.550
Get me a doctor. Please.

225
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.450
- I'll give you a name.
- You're giving me a brain tumor.


226
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:31.350
You give me a pass,
I'll give you the fucking gold!


227
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.750
Nobody knows where it is
but me, you know.


228
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.050
Did you burn your partner?

229
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.950
I need a doctor.

230
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.550
You took the gold
and left him there, didn't you?


231
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.850
No wonder you drank. You figured
jail was the best place to lay low.


232
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.550
Just keep pulling my chain...

233
00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.150
keep on with
with this happy horseshit...


234
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.150
l'll make sure
you do need a doctor.


235
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.750
- Ed?
- What, goddamn it?!


236
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.950
I don't think he's faking.

237
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.350
Damn, I was just trying
to have a good meal.


238
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.050
Damn!

239
00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.750
And I just thought you had gas.

240
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.450
Oh, shit.

241
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.250
- What the hell?
- Get in there.


242
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.150
Move it.

243
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.550
You lucky. Oh, you lucky.

244
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.550
Sit down, Alvin.

245
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.250
Not there.

246
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.350
Oh, yeah. Got reserved seats.

247
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.050
Watching the game?

248
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.550
Big screen.

249
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.050
Hey, look, I apologize...

250
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.850
about that irreverent shit
I displayed in the cell.


251
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.950
I was out of line.

252
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.150
I had been lifting weights...

253
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.050
and I just got through doing curls,
so I was real tense.


254
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.350
Hey, Alvin?

255
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.450
I got some good news.

256
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.150
And bad news.
Want to hear the good news?


257
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.750
Yeah, I mean, good news is great.

258
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.850
You're fucked.
Want to hear the bad news?


259
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.550
I think you just
told me the bad news.

260
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.750
Unless you want to tell me
worser news.


261
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.850
You're alone in a room with me.

262
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.850
Yeah, right.

263
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.550
So, what you want?

264
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.350
You and....

265
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.550
You and Jaster were alone
in that cell for eight hours.


266
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.350
All alone.

267
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.650
You must have talked about something.

268
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.950
His bowels.

269
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.750
He was shitting and coughing
and it didn't smell good.


270
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.550
How do you talk to somebody like that?

271
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.450
- It's terrible.
- Alvin.


272
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.650
I do this for a living.

273
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.050
You think I can't see that
you're hiding something?


274
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.950
Okay, everybody out.

275
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.250
Alvin, think about Jaster...

276
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.350
and tell me
where you want the bruises.


277
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.750
You trying to try
some sneaky shit, huh?


278
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.150
Gonna fool me with the quiet voice
while you beat on my body.


279
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.150
You can do that,
but you can't beat on my soul.


280
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.350
Do the words "Stokely Carmichael"
mean anything to y'all?


281
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.450
Reverend Malcolm X?
Reverend AI Sharpton?


282
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.650
I see you taking off your Timex.

283
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.050
I ain't telling you shit nor
the brothers behind the aquarium.


284
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.150
You can kiss my ass
with your tongue...


285
00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.750
and I will take
this information to my grave.


286
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.450
The man said something
about the Bronx Zoo, okay?


287
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.250
Well?

288
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.850
We completed our search
of The World of Darkness.


289
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.250
That would be your bats,
your leopard cats, your mole rats.


290
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.150
We came up empty, sir.

291
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.950
"There's no place like home".

292
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.350
- It's gotta be a building.
- We checked them all.


293
00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.750
We checked the monkey house,
the reptile house, the giraffe house.


294
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.450
Even the outhouse.

295
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.250
We scanned the entire grounds
to a depth of 20 feet.


296
00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.450
This guy was
a heavy-equipment operator.


297
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.750
Five minutes with a machine,
he could've buried the gold anywhere.


298
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.850
So where does that leave us, sir?

299
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.950
Square-fucking-one.

300
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.850
Come on, let's go
check the outhouse again.


301
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.050
Let's go.

302
00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.650
We have a national security crisis.

303
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.350
Citadel 4 is the same system we use
to safeguard our nuclear facilities.


304
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.850
This guy took it apart like
he was hot-wiring a Toyota.


305
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.350
I'll give you the short version.

306
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.750
We're talking world-class loner.

307
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:52.250
A guy who spent literally tens
of thousands of hours at a computer...


308
00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.350
feeling around in the dark.
Nothing but math.


309
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.950
Nothing but numbers.

310
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.950
His sense of well-being, his very
sanity is predicated on completion.


311
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.150
Only this time,
the equation is incomplete.


312
00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.550
He didn't get the 42 million in gold
he'd worked so very hard for.


313
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.750
That's our edge.

314
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:18.850
Now this....

315
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.950
This is what I need your money for.

316
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.650
It's a BC-19.

317
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.450
It's an experimental tracking device.

318
00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.050
Dr. Harris here can fill you in.

319
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.450
Well, it's quite simple, really.

320
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.650
The BC-19 has a proprietary signal...

321
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.350
broadcast and location.

322
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:48.250
It's got a 10-mile radius and
full satellite coordinate tracking.


323
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.750
Now, the optimum placement site...

324
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.350
is the temporal mandibular joint.

325
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.550
It's just below the jaw.

326
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.250
All right, look...

327
00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.250
we implant this in
the appropriate subject, put him...


328
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.050
on the street, make it known
he knows where the gold is...


329
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.650
and I guarantee that our elusive
computer whiz will show up.


330
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:14.050
Who would be willing to have
that thing implanted in their jaw?


331
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:15.750
Senator...

332
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.450
we already have a volunteer.

333
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.850
This is Howard Cosell.

334
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.650
Down goes Frazier!

335
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.050
Come on.

336
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.950
Tenderize that bitch, Alvin.

337
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.650
- What you got?
- I got all kinds of shit.


338
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.350
Chest, chest, chest, nuts!

339
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.950
What do you know about boxing?

340
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.150
I ain't gotta box.
I get my skills from TV.


341
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.850
I got Mike Tyson skills.
You biting me!


342
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.650
My ears, my ears!

343
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.450
I'll go Muhammad Ali on them.

344
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.650
- That's cold.
- That ain't right.


345
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:06.250
That ain't right.

346
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.950
Once I get out of here, I'll get
my big score. I'll be set for life.


347
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.850
I'll get me a 1-year-old Arabian.

348
00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:14.050
A 1-year-old?
What sick shit is that?


349
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:18.050
I'm talking horses. Thoroughbreds.
They got royalty in their blood.


350
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.050
- What you know about horses?
- I know everything.


351
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.550
My father took me to the horse track.

352
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.150
Taught me everything
about thoroughbreds.


353
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.650
I'm teaching you awareness here.
See, I'm always aware.


354
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.750
Stay aware of everything.
Are you watching? Watch my skills.


355
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.250
I'm always aware. See my eyes?
I'm on a swivel.


356
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.750
Can't nobody sneak up on you
and just get with you. That's...


357
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.250
Mr. Clenteen, exactly how many laws
are we breaking here?


358
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.550
You don't want to know.

359
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.450
Ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.650
You've all distinguished yourselves.

361
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.550
You're all the best at what you do.

362
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.950
Encryption.

363
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.150
Hardware.

364
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.850
Signal analysis.

365
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.050
And as of this moment...

366
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.350
nothing else in your lives exists.

367
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.750
You no longer exist.

368
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.450
Welcome aboard.

369
00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.750
Don't disappoint me.

370
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.750
Sir, I'm in.

371
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.350
All right, here we go.

372
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.750
Case number 1411263.

373
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.250
Subject: Alvin Dean Sanders.

374
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.850
Former cellmate: John Delano Jaster.

375
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.650
Released from Sing Sing prison Friday.

376
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.750
Treasury surveillance
subcontract required.


377
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.650
Pay-grade status approved.

378
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.950
Split-shift overtime coverage.

379
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.650
Contact Special Agent Vicks
at tspec.com.


380
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.450
Ed, you actually think this guy is
surfing Treasury Department files?


381
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.950
What if he can't decode this?
We can make a less secure encryption.


382
00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.650
Maybe we should indicate we think
Sanders knows where the gold is.


383
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.950
Listen to me. I had a grandfather
who was a trapper by profession.


384
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:56.350
Now he had two prices
on his card: wolf...


385
00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.550
and everything else.

386
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.150
Now a wolf...

387
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.350
will starve itself to death...

388
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.650
rather than make a mistake.

389
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:12.450
You have to lay down a scent
that smells real from far away.


390
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.650
And the bait...

391
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:19.150
has to be fresh
and untouched by human hands.


392
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.350
And make no mistake about it...

393
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.950
we are hunting wolf.

394
00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.450
Send the message.

395
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.250
Voice recognition, please.

396
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.650
Voice recognition, please.

397
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.350
Bristol here.

398
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.050
- All is well and good.
- Good morning, sir.


399
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.850
Mainframe up, please.

400
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.650
Mainframe boot sequence complete.

401
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.750
System check, please.

402
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.350
All systems are online.

403
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.350
Let's see....

404
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.550
Overnights, please.

405
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.250
Overnights loading from NSA...

406
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:18.750
and Treasury Department
servers U.S. dot gov.


407
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:22.350
Overnights loaded, ready for review.

408
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.450
Where shall we start today?

409
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.550
NSA, please.

410
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.050
NSA loaded.

411
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.350
A secret, huh?

412
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.850
I love a secret.

413
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.250
Alvin...

414
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.450
do you feel like a lucky man?

415
00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:00.050
No. Yes.
Well, it depends on what you....


416
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:03.950
Of all the many crimes
that men commit...


417
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.350
the worst punishment
is rewarded those...


418
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.850
who squander their good fortune.

419
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.850
- You're right, you're right.
- You understand me?


420
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.150
No, sir.

421
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.650
Mr. Sanders...

422
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.450
you were arrested and booked...

423
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.150
by a police officer
named Wayne Miller for...


424
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.750
theft of shrimp.

425
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.550
Well, you know,
actually they were prawns.


426
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.750
You know the big jumbo shrimp
that's, like, at least a dollar...


427
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.550
Six weeks ago,
in an internal investigation...


428
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.950
Miller admitted to a dozen counts
of falsifying evidence.


429
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.550
Son of a...

430
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.250
Jesus.

431
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.750
Thank God for people
that come forward.


432
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:48.950
Needless to say, we've been petitioned
to repudiate the convictions.


433
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.750
Repudiation is what...

434
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:53.750
What everybody needs more of
is a little repudiation.


435
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.650
Now, repudiation is....
Use it in a sentence.


436
00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.850
I have a short sentence
for you, Alvin.


437
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.150
You walk.

438
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.650
I'm back, baby!

439
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.150
You miss me?

440
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.950
I'm free!

441
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:28.150
New York City, do you feel me?

442
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.250
Okay, let's take it for a spin.

443
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.150
Time code is locked.
Satellite uplink is sealed.


444
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.250
Tracking is a go.

445
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:55.650
Hey, yo, taxi!

446
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.850
Yeah, where you going there?

447
00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.450
I'm trying to get to Queens.

448
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.050
Jeez, that's bad for me.

449
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.550
I don't go to Queens.

450
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:05.750
What do you mean?

451
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.450
I seldom get there.
Where is it?


452
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.250
Copy that.
All right, guys, we're up.


453
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.450
Checking sound levels.
Levels are stable, sir.


454
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.350
Good. We have a visual?

455
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.150
Air Unit, this is Mobile 1.
Confirming.


456
00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.050
We have a visual. Do you copy?

457
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.950
Roger that. The bird has ears.

458
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.350
Who is it?

459
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.450
I hear you didn't pay your bill.
I'm here for your bills.


460
00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.550
- My mom ain't here.
- Just like you people.


461
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:57.650
- Get your ass away from my door.
- Come out.


462
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:59.550
What's up?

463
00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.750
- What's going down?
- What's happening, baby?


464
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:05.950
- You escape?
- As a matter of fact....


465
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:10.850
Quit playing so much. You know
I got warrants and stuff around here.


466
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.550
- They don't just let people go.
- They let me go.


467
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.750
Well, that sound like some bullcrap.

468
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.150
It wasn't. They can't hold me.

469
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.550
I'm the man.
Alvin, king of the seafood.


470
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.750
Oh, my God, Steven.

471
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:28.450
Oh, my God.
My stomach hurts and I'm crying.


472
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.650
What's wrong? Happy to be out?

473
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.750
You a full-fledged criminal. Look.
It's like The Price is Right.


474
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.050
That's right. That's right.

475
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:38.750
Mom's still here, right?

476
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.050
We live here now.

477
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.750
Tell him, Stevie.

478
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.150
"Tell me, Stevie".

479
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.150
What is that?

480
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.450
That's a Tika.

481
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.950
We about to get married
when she gets that blood test.


482
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.750
That's a bullshit test.

483
00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.950
You're just fucking with me.

484
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:03.950
Yeah.

485
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:08.150
- Make sure she gets all her shots.
- I'm gonna do that.


486
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:09.650
Where'd you get all this?

487
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.050
Julio and Ramundo cut me in
on a sweet Godfather deal.


488
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.550
See, you cut Julio and Ramundo out.

489
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.350
It's just me and you.
We back on the block.


490
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.750
This guy's a real beauty.

491
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:23.250
Are you surprised?

492
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:25.850
I think I'll go...

493
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.450
see my girl, Lisa.

494
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.650
- Who?
- Lisa.


495
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.150
That won't be pretty.

496
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.550
What you mean?
She ain't been seeing nobody, has she?


497
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.150
It ain't like I'm tripping
on the whole thing.


498
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.250
I mean, not that I give a damn.

499
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.750
They'll do what they do
and I'll do what I do.


500
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.050
Right, that's how you are.
You ain't never been like...


501
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.750
I'm gonna shower and run over.

502
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.250
- Good seeing you, bro.
- Good seeing you.


503
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.850
- She probably...
- You went crazy since....


504
00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.350
I'll put my work in, though.
You my money.


505
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.550
Who's Lisa?

506
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:04.850
That's the girlfriend.

507
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.950
They were living together.

508
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:08.850
Lisa Hill, 27...

509
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:12.250
assistant manager ofBook Stew,
a used bookstore in Soho.


510
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.050
She also waits tables
at the Sunrise Lounge.


511
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:20.050
There better not be nobody
in there either. I'm serious.


512
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:23.650
If there is, and if he ain't big,
I'll put the boots to him.


513
00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:24.950
Put the boots on him.

514
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:27.850
Hang on.

515
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.250
You're early.

516
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.250
You damn right I am.

517
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.050
Oh, my God. Alvin?

518
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.350
What up?
You going on a date behind my back?


519
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:44.850
Fuck you, Alvin.

520
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:48.550
That's music to my ears.
Where do you want it? The couch?


521
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.650
You disappear for two years, then have
the nerve to ask about my life?


522
00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.050
Fuck you, Alvin.

523
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.650
You mean, like really "fuck you"
fuck you? Like "motherfuck you"?


524
00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.050
Bad move, Alvin.
Can't be too jealous.


525
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.550
- Turn around and walk out.
- I got you flowers.


526
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.850
Oh, thank you. 
Now you can leave.

527
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.450
You need to pump your brakes
and recognize that your man is home.


528
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:12.050
So, what happened, Alvin?
You escaped?


529
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.050
Yeah, we had to tunnel out.
It was terrible.


530
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.550
They released the dogs. They caught
up with me and my whole crew.


531
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.350
Harriet Tubman, Kunte Kinte.
Harriet don't move like she used to.


532
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.450
The dogs was chewing all on her ass.

533
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:29.150
You know what, I don't have time
for this random gibberish.


534
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.050
There was a dirty cop
so they let me go.


535
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.450
Congratulations. Now leave.

536
00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.050
You don't mean that.

537
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.750
How come you didn't come see me?
You didn't write me or nothing.


538
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.850
I was going to come see you.
I was gonna write you and tell...


539
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.650
You wouldn't understand.

540
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:49.650
I wouldn't understand? I don't
understand why we ain't celebrating.


541
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.450
I'm out. I'm back home.

542
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.150
Home? No, see, this is my house.

543
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.550
I pay the bills, I pay the rent.
You pay...?


544
00:41:58.350 --> 00:41:59.850
Exactly. Excuse me.

545
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.450
You're upset. Stevie was the one
behind the whole thing.


546
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.350
I was on my way to church.

547
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.850
The next thing I know, I'm stealing.

548
00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:12.150
Stevie? I don't remember hearing
anything about Stevie going to jail.


549
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:16.350
Lisa, look at me. Do I look
like I've been in day camp?


550
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:19.350
I been around hard-core criminals.

551
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.750
I'd like something soft
up against my body.


552
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.050
I'd like to have a home-cooked meal,
a hug from my woman.


553
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.650
What about a table dance?

554
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.750
- Prison has changed me.
- Oh, really?


555
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:33.950
Yes, it has. And I'm ready
for responsibility. What is that?


556
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.850
What do you think it is?

557
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.750
A puppy, I hope.

558
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.850
It's not a puppy.

559
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.850
What you been doing since I been gone?

560
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.550
What's going on?

561
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:50.850
Sweetie.

562
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.650
This is your son, Alvin.

563
00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.750
That ain't my son.

564
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.250
You think I made it up?

565
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:02.650
I don't know.

566
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:05.950
I mean, how?

567
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:10.350
How? That night,
after Stevie's birthday party.


568
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.250
Yeah, we did and...

569
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:16.650
wow.

570
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:23.950
He don't really look like me.
He kind of chubby, ain't got no teeth.


571
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.050
IKind of cute.

572
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.050
Can I hold him?

573
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.350
Don't be like that.
Can I hold my son?


574
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.550
He calling for his daddy anyway.

575
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.750
Please?

576
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.250
I cannot believe this. Look at this!

577
00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:56.250
Doesn't it trip you out?

578
00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.450
Me and you, and the next thing
you know, we got this.


579
00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.750
It's like half and half,
I guess, you know.


580
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.050
- He'll be a little player.
- He won't be a player.


581
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:11.150
He's strong. Look at that grip.
Big old fella.


582
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.150
I think he sprung a leak.
He kind of smells.


583
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.850
Never mind, Alvin.

584
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:23.250
I'm going to work. The babysitter
will be here in five minutes.


585
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.150
Come on, Lisa.

586
00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:36.150
Just give me another chance.
I'll get out there, I'll get a job.


587
00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:39.450
Take care of myself.
I'll take care of you.


588
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.150
We got a whole little family.
Don't squeeze me out of that.


589
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.450
You know, Alvin,
it's been really hard.


590
00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.450
I know. It's hard for everybody.

591
00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.950
Okay, but you gotta prove yourself.

592
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.550
- You gotta get a job.
- I'll get that.


593
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.650
- Stay out of jail.
- I don't remember how to get to jail.


594
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.850
And stop dressing like a thug.

595
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:09.850
I'll get a new Versace, Gucci.

596
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:11.350
Maybe I'll consider...

597
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.350
- Making love to your man?
- Having dinner with you.


598
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:18.950
You'll like the way I cook.
While I was in there, taught me how.


599
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:20.750
I can cook you anything.

600
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:25.050
French. Bon giorno.
I can cook ltalian. Ciao, bella.


601
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.050
Or I can cook, like, soul food.

602
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.050
"Daisy, check your greens.
They done spoiled now".


603
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.150
- Goodbye, Alvin.
- Can I get a kiss?


604
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.950
- Goodbye, Alvin.
- All right. Take it easy.


605
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.650
- Lisa?
- Yes?


606
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.950
What's my son's name?

607
00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.650
- His name is Gregory.
- Gregory.


608
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:49.850
Gregory.

609
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.650
G
-Dog! That's all right.

610
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:58.550
That's your daddy.

611
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.150
I think old Alvin just
might make it this time.


612
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.250
Alvin Sanders is bait.

613
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:13.250
That's all he is.

614
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.850
When he's served his purpose...

615
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.850
when he draws our man
out of the shadows....


616
00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:24.650
Well, you know what happens to bait.

617
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:32.750
Well, well, well.

618
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.550
Decoding complete.

619
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.450
Sequence complete.

620
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:56.850
Look at this shit.

621
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.250
Clown.

622
00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:00.250
Sushi chef.

623
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:02.750
Male exotic dancer.

624
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.350
That might be all right.

625
00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:10.050
What's cracking?

626
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.450
Yes, I'm looking
for a Mr. Alvin Sanders.


627
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:17.450
I do not know if
a Mr. Sanders is around.


628
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:18.850
Who is calling?

629
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.950
My name is Rhonda Glimsher.
I'm a student at Columbia University.


630
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.450
- I'm working on my master's degree.
- Trace it.


631
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.950
- Excuse me? You said "Master P"?
- Master's degree.


632
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.250
Toronto.

633
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.550
No, wait. Dublin.

634
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.550
No, I got it. Madrid!

635
00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.650
This is Mobile 1. We're on it.

636
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:39.150
Orlando?

637
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:40.850
I was given Mr. 
Sander's name...

638
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.150
from the Department
of Corrections.


639
00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:46.150
Sons of bitches. 
Anyway, go on.

640
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.150
Going through a call diverter!

641
00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:51.350
- Nothing.
- Give me 63 again.


642
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:52.650
Got the location.

643
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:56.450
Air unit, Mobile 1
requesting visual support.


644
00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.850
I'm doing an aftercare survey
as part of my thesis...


645
00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.550
and I'm paying 200 dollars
per interview.


646
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.250
What? 200 dollars?

647
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:08.750
It's a skipped signal.

648
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.250
Not isolating frequency.

649
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.450
- Try a back-end patch.
- What do you think I'm doing?


650
00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.450
Are you Mr. Sanders?

651
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.850
I am not him,
but I am Mr. Sanders'...

652
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.050
agent.

653
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.250
Give me 63 again. 
Where are you?

654
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.750
Tel Aviv. Where is he?!

655
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:28.050
I must be sure you're not lying.
Mr. Sanders doesn't like that.


656
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.450
Mr. Sanders could get upset...

657
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:33.450
and pop cap in ass.
You ever been capped and popped?


658
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:35.950
- Going to original patch.
- Showing 13 countries!


659
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.850
- It was 71.
- It was 74!


660
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.350
Stay on the line.
IKeep him on the line.


661
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.550
- What do you got?
- It must be another call box.


662
00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.950
I'll call back in a few days
for an appointment.


663
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:51.550
Make sure you do because
I really need to get that cash.


664
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.250
Thank you for your time.

665
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:58.150
We got nothing here!

666
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:59.950
He's gone.

667
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.350
I've never seen anything like this.

668
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.550
It was him.

669
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.650
He crawled out from the dark...

670
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.750
and he fucking bit.

671
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:41.550
Boss, boss, boss.

672
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.450
What's happening, my man?

673
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.150
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for a job.


674
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.550
I'd like to start
in entrepreneurial...


675
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.750
but if not, I'll work my way up
from the washroom.


676
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:53.550
Wait tables or whatever.

677
00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.750
I had a couple problems, okay?

678
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.350
But everything is cool now.

679
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.650
Didn't you rob me a few years ago?

680
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.050
You walked in with a skinny guy...

681
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.650
picked up my cash register
and ran out the door with it.


682
00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:16.650
No, that wasn't me.
I don't hang out with thin dudes.


683
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:19.650
Your friend got away.
I picked you out of the lineup.


684
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.150
Number four. You were number four!

685
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:25.150
I was number four in high school
when I played ball.


686
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:28.050
Cute. Now you're here
asking me for a job?


687
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.650
You holding me up again?
I'm calling the police.


688
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:33.850
- 911. I need the cops.
- You tripping.


689
00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.050
This is just a resume.
Everybody...


690
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:37.850
you see, this is a resume.

691
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.450
This isn't happening.

692
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.750
This is a resume.

693
00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:46.750
Please, I'm putting the resume down
right now.


694
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.950
Okay? IKeep eating, please.

695
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:51.250
Ricky Martin, don't make me do this.

696
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.250
I ain't here for this.
Hands...


697
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:54.450
WWF!

698
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.050
I called the cops.

699
00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.850
Damn! Getting a job
is getting dangerous.


700
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.450
Stop that guy!

701
00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.750
- Ijust wanted ajob.
- Oh, fuck.


702
00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.450
Maybe you picked the wrong guy.

703
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.150
Or not.

704
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.850
Give me another chance.
I'll get out there. I'll get ajob.


705
00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:39.850
Take care ofmyself,
I'll take care of you.


706
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.350
We got a whole little family.

707
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.050
Don't squeeze me out of that.

708
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.450
What's my son's name?

709
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.150
Gregory.

710
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:02.250
Alvin, get in.

711
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.050
Stevie...

712
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:05.750
is this stolen?

713
00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:09.950
No, Julio and Ramundo hooked me up
with this. I'm tight with them.


714
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:13.050
No, you ain't. This is stolen.
I ain't getting in.


715
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.350
Julio and Ramundo...

716
00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:18.050
hooked me up with this.
I'm tight with them.


717
00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.550
It is not stolen.

718
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.050
Alvin, get in.

719
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.250
It's stolen.

720
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:26.250
It is not stolen.
Man, it is cold outside.


721
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:28.150
It's flu season. Get in.

722
00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:31.650
You know me. I'll go through
some cold. I ain't....


723
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:33.650
I ain't standing here much longer.

724
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.950
Why you got to be my brother?

725
00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.450
We're fine. Look, baby...

726
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.250
I know you'll get me in trouble.

727
00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:42.950
I'm gonna rock this box
in your ear.


728
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.150
I don't feel like listening...

729
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:46.750
Who that?

730
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:22.550
We're on the 59th Street Bridge,
headed into the city.


731
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:28.150
This ain't the way home.

732
00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:30.950
We got some business to take care of.

733
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:33.850
Steven, I told you, man...

734
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:35.550
Just sit back and relax.

735
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:39.350
You riding with something like a pimp.
I'm something like a pimp.


736
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.950
I'm supposed to be a pimp
on the thirteenth.


737
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.650
I'm something like a pimp.
I'm something like it.


738
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.650
He just made a left off 2nd.
Moving east on Canal.


739
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.350
He's going to the docks.

740
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:08.650
According to this file on Steve,
that's where he makes his pickups.


741
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.250
This way, gentlemen.

742
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.650
I pulled a bust sheet from NYPD
and guess what?


743
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:40.250
They got an undercover special
going down tonight at Pier 27.


744
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.850
Christ! That stupid son of a bitch
is about to get pinched.


745
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:45.850
Mobile 3, move in.

746
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:50.050
Pull over. I'm not doing this.

747
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:51.850
- Nope.
- I'm going straight.


748
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.250
Pull the car over.

749
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:56.850
Alvin, you're ex-con.
You just got out of the penitentiary.


750
00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:00.450
You got 26 dollars in your pocket,

751
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.050
- Pull over.
- I'm not pulling...


752
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:06.250
- Get your finger out my face.
- Get your finger out my face.


753
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:07.750
- Don't touch me.
- Don't touch me.


754
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.150
- Don't touch me.
- Don't touch me.


755
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.950
I didn 't touch you!

756
00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:15.350
- Don't touch me.
- I ain't.


757
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.150
- You touched me.
- I didn't touch you!


758
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:19.250
I got business.

759
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.350
- Hello?
- Give me this phone.


760
00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.950
- Yo, Stevie.
- Yeah, Julio? Ramundo?


761
00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:27.050
He can't come to the phone.
He banging your girlfriend.


762
00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.550
- Give me the phone.
- "Ah, it's so good!"


763
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.350
"lt's not fair
that you do your thing!"


764
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:33.550
Give me the phone.

765
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:37.650
It was that fuck, Alvin.

766
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.350
Alvin?
That kid ain't nothing but trouble.


767
00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:42.250
Stop playing, man!

768
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:44.550
I make 10 G's off them a week.

769
00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.850
- Ten G's?
- Yeah.


770
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.950
Plus they sell food stamps.
I bought 160 for...


771
00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.150
it was 84, something like that.

772
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:54.350
- Ten G's?
- That's right.


773
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:02.050
Turn left on East Broadway...

774
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.750
half a mile before they turn.

775
00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.450
Mobile 3. Do not
let him enter the docks.


776
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:16.550
- Do not let him make that turn.
- Copy that.


777
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:32.950
What the hell?!
What's going on?


778
00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:40.650
- What the hell's your problem, man?
- Oh, shit!


779
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.250
Did you jump out
a cab and not pay?

780
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:50.550
Quit talking and drive.

781
00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:54.150
This ain't no Cadillac!

782
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:58.150
You can't run into me! This
ain 't no Buick! Do I know you?


783
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:04.050
- This dude's losing his mind.
- Pull over now! Right now!


784
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:05.850
- He got a gun.
- To shoot you.


785
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:08.550
- Don't you have a gun?
- Not with me.


786
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.650
Pull the fucking car over!

787
00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:12.950
Use your finger. Get away!

788
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:17.550
- Ain't working.
- I know.


789
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.650
Trip around him!

790
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.550
Handle your business, boy!

791
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:29.050
Watch out!

792
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:40.450
Take a right here.

793
00:57:58.350 --> 00:57:59.650
Damn! Shit.

794
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.950
Damn, Stevie.
What the hell was that?


795
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:12.950
Shit, man. We late.

796
00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:16.650
Come on, man. We can walk
to the docks from here.


797
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.550
Come on. You with me?

798
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.450
Come on.

799
00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:28.750
You with me?

800
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.550
Come on.

801
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.650
Can't be a fuck-up all your life.

802
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.050
- He's moving.
- Direction?


803
00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:44.250
North on Jackson Street.

804
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:47.650
Away from the docks.

805
00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:00.450
Fucking lowlife.

806
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.950
You undercover piece of shit.

807
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:05.450
Does your mother know
what you do for a living?


808
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.450
That's real funny.

809
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:09.550
Watch your head.

810
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:17.650
I think I know why Stevie didn't show.

811
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:19.750
I think he set us up.

812
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:23.350
The minute we make bail, he's dead.

813
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.650
Him and his brother, Alvin.

814
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:50.550
All right, I want every agent
working around the clock...


815
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.050
to keep this joker
out of the morgue and out of jail.


816
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:58.450
He doesn't get so much
as a parking ticket or a hangnail.


817
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.750
From now on, Alvin Sanders
leads a charmed life.


818
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:26.150
Come on, come on.

819
01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.050
Alvin.

820
01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:32.150
Alvin, it's late.

821
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:36.150
I know, but I really need
to talk to you right now.


822
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.650
I got this for Gregory.

823
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:44.450
- An egg?
- It's supposed to be magic.


824
01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.850
Anyway, he can't swallow it.

825
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:48.950
Can I come in?

826
01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:51.850
Just for a minute?

827
01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.050
All right, but keep it down.

828
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.450
- The baby's sleeping.
- All right.


829
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:08.850
Did I ever tell you
that I had a very happy childhood?


830
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:12.550
- That's not what Stevie says.
- Stevie.


831
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:17.450
Dad used to pick me up every day
to take the cargo train to Manhattan.


832
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:20.250
Go to the horse track.
I knew it really well.


833
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:22.550
I know. Your dad trained horses.

834
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:24.450
Not really.

835
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.550
No. No, he was a....

836
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:33.050
He was a groom. 
I lied about that.

837
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:40.150
But he was a great groom.
With the thoroughbreds, he was magic.


838
01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:45.350
I say he was the best.
But, you know, job didn't pay shit.


839
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:51.750
So, therefore, our Christmases,
we didn't get jack shit.


840
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.650
Which really pissed him off.

841
01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:59.850
One day he just went to this toy store
and just stole all these toys.


842
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.250
Robbed them.

843
01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.350
Brought the toys over to the crib.

844
01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:07.450
I was like, "Damn, Santa Claus
got the wrong address or what?"


845
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:13.050
So I'm bouncing from toy to toy
like I'm some kind of drunk dude.


846
01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:17.950
Mom's smiling. 
My father's smiling.

847
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.050
It's all good, right?

848
01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:25.850
Then around 8:30, cops show up.

849
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.750
Take the toys, take my father.

850
01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.350
But for about two and a half hours...

851
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.850
l had a very, very happy childhood.

852
01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:43.150
Why are you telling me all this?

853
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.550
Because I love you.

854
01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:48.350
Talk about a bunch of crap.

855
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:52.150
It's all in his file, sir.
It's all true.


856
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:55.250
He knows so much,
why not get a job at the track?


857
01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:59.450
He's had a record since he's 14.
Can't work there with a record.


858
01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:02.050
Oh, they all got sob stories.

859
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.550
He's just trying to get laid.

860
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:44.450
What you use on your skin?
It's so soft.


861
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.650
- You feel that?
- Oh, yeah.


862
01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:57.550
You feel so good.

863
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.150
- What's that smell?
- It's mango.


864
01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:12.250
Mango. Oh, mango!

865
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:17.750
And some pineapple.

866
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.150
Oh, shit. Who is he?

867
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:44.850
All right, I'm gonna go to Starbucks
and get a Mango Grande.


868
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.850
- Mocha.
- Mocha Cappuccino.


869
01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:00.850
Who is it?

870
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:03.250
Registered letter for Alvin Sanders.

871
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:06.150
- Who's it from?
- Uncle Sam.


872
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:10.650
Damn. I just got out, man.
Why you bugging me? I know my rights.


873
01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.850
It says in the Constitution
on page 53, "We the People...


874
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:17.850
in order to keep shit straight..."
Quit messing with me.


875
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.950
I think it's a check.

876
01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:23.850
Good afternoon.

877
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:26.350
Where l... Let me see where I sign.

878
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:28.250
I don't ever get no checks.

879
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:33.250
I was about to go postal on you. No
pun intended. I know all about it.


880
01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:36.950
Y'all do it for real and everything.
You make the news...


881
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.250
All right.

882
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.850
Apologies from the federal government,
$5000?


883
01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:44.150
Guess it's your lucky day.

884
01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:48.450
Hey, man, tell Uncle Sam
he cool with me, man.


885
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:50.350
Apology accepted.

886
01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:54.250
Tell him he can come through
anytime he want to.


887
01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.450
Five G's. I'm up in there!

888
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:58.850
- I'm up in there!
- Sir?


889
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.350
You think maybe we gave him too much?

890
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:05.050
Let's just hope this keeps him
out of trouble for a couple weeks.


891
01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:32.850
Excuse me, Afrikanic soul sister,
but do you have the book:


892
01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:35.750
Butt-naked in the Forest,
But Does Anybody Hear Me?


893
01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:37.350
What are you doing here?

894
01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:39.450
What? I'm here to see you.

895
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:42.550
Listen, I got great news.

896
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:45.050
You found a job!

897
01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:48.550
No, no, not yet.

898
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.750
But I got something better than that.

899
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:53.750
You said things would
be different this time.


900
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:57.650
Things are very different.
Look at this.


901
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.550
I got a check from the government
for $5000.


902
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:05.350
The government gave you $5000.
All right, tell me anything.


903
01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:09.250
The government gave me a check.
I signed it over to you.


904
01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:13.950
What the fuck is he doing?
That's our money he's giving away.


905
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:16.150
Actually, it's taxpayer money.

906
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:19.950
I could give you this money.
It'll pay for some of the things...


907
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:23.950
like the back rent.
Some of the money I borrowed...


908
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:25.750
Like the stereo you sold.

909
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:28.450
- I sold the stereo?
- Or the VCR you took.


910
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:31.850
- I took the VCR?
- The blender my mama gave me.


911
01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:35.750
The blender was cheap. I didn't get
that much money for the blender.


912
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:39.550
I'm not taking it, Alvin.

913
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.150
I don't think you understand.

914
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:46.450
I been trying to get a job.
It's hard right now.


915
01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:49.750
That's a lot of money.
I think you need it more than I do.


916
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:52.350
Take some money
and get Gregory something.


917
01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:56.050
Get him platinum baby pieces
or something like that, you know.


918
01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:58.250
He'll probably be a little rapper.

919
01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:02.050
- No, maybe he's gonna be a doctor.
- Why would he want to do that?


920
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:07.450
Doctor's great. I was thinking...
You thinking like I'm thinking.


921
01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:13.150
Just take the money. Get him
some toys. Say it's from his father.


922
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:16.950
Alvin, honestly, have you really
been trying to find a job?


923
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:20.750
I have been out there.
You sound like my mom.


924
01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:24.950
I want you to get this money.
Go get you a nice dress.


925
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:29.250
We can kick it. I can romance you.
Look at your brown eyes.


926
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:30.750
Now, come on.

927
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:34.050
Get back to work
before we both be out of work.


928
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.150
Okay, step. Thank you.

929
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:39.450
Sorry, my man.

930
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.350
Don't mention it.

931
01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:08.650
Now what do we do?

932
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.350
Simple. We give him more money.

933
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:14.150
You sure that's necessary?
He 's trying to change.


934
01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.550
He 'll never change.

935
01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.550
We just gotta keep him clean
for a few more days.


936
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:22.950
- Well, how much money?
- Sixty-five hundred.


937
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.750
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to send him to NYU?


938
01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:28.850
How do you feel about
working in Alaska?


939
01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:32.550
I'll get right on this.

940
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.750
You gotta help me, man!
You gotta help me!


941
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:07.850
Get your damn hands off me.

942
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:12.050
Slow down coming through here, now.

943
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:15.850
What's going on?

944
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:27.750
Hey, you dropped your bag!

945
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:33.350
Hey, man, you dropped your bag.

946
01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:37.250
Yo! You dropped your bag.

947
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.150
Man, you done dropped your bag.

948
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:45.150
You done dropped your bag. Oh, shit.

949
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:46.850
Oh, shit.

950
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:53.250
I'll take it to lost and found.

951
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.350
Found where you lost it.

952
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:17.950
Man, where you guys been?
Man, I was just thinking about you.


953
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:19.950
Your brother fucked us.

954
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:22.650
Are you stupid?
This is my fucking car.


955
01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:24.150
This is my baby.

956
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:26.150
Oh, sorry.

957
01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:28.650
Your brother fucked us!

958
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:30.250
Look, all right. Cool.

959
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:31.950
How's your headache, though?

960
01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.450
- What headache?
- Does it hurt?


961
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:37.750
I'm passing whuppings out.

962
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:41.950
Okay, okay, I see what you doing.
You got the gun.


963
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:47.050
Stevie's fucking my girl, right?

964
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:49.850
That's a point to take up with Stevie.

965
01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:54.950
Maybe Stevie don't want to be around
for us to make a point with him.


966
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:57.850
What are you talking about?

967
01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:59.350
Stevie skipped out.

968
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:01.850
Then say it. Don't get
so fucking complex.


969
01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:04.250
I'm not complex. 
You're complex.

970
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:06.550
Do I need to
be here for this shit?

971
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:07.750
Shut up!

972
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.250
Should we move in?

973
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.850
Stay put. They're not gonna kill him.

974
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:13.450
They're just having fun.

975
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:15.250
They'll beat him to a pulp.

976
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:17.550
I think that's
a reasonable assumption.


977
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:22.450
I hope you like soup...

978
01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:25.550
because I'm about to knock
every one of your teeth...


979
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:28.350
...down your throat.
- Excuse me.


980
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:32.550
Can you tell me how to get to the
Fashion Museum? I'm a little lost.


981
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:37.250
Put the gun down.

982
01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:40.650
What's your problem?
Go get lost somewhere else.


983
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:50.550
Ain't you shocked at how it went down?

984
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:53.050
You came at the right time.

985
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.150
We don't have much time, Alvin.

986
01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:57.150
What you talking about?

987
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:59.450
There's a question you need to answer.

988
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.950
- That's him! That's our man!
- Shit!


989
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:11.050
Unit 2, approach from the south.

990
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:16.250
You need to answer my question.
How you know my name?


991
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:18.750
I'll see you soon, Alvin.

992
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:28.250
There he is!

993
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:31.550
Shit, damn. Damn!

994
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:39.050
What's going on?

995
01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:41.450
He 's in the coffee shop.

996
01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:43.650
Get out of the way.

997
01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:09.650
Get some guys at both ends
of the alley.


998
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.950
Want to hear the bad news?
You're alone in a room with me.


999
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.050
I think it's a check.

1000
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:27.150
Guess it's your lucky day.

1001
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:31.650
Sir. We're ready here, sir.

1002
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:10.750
I thought I'd find you here.

1003
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:13.550
I did too.
You want a drink or something?


1004
01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:15.250
No, I need to talk to you.

1005
01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:17.550
- Right now?
- Let's go, right now.


1006
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:21.850
I'm coming. I'll be right back.
Fucking ass.


1007
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:29.250
What y'all doing
in the men's bathroom?


1008
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:34.550
Alvin, man, what's happening?
Man, what's wrong?


1009
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:36.050
By yourself?

1010
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:37.550
Not now. Not now.

1011
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.850
Everything in here's broke.

1012
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:43.050
What's happening?

1013
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.450
Have you ever heard of a man getting
$5000 dropped in his lap?


1014
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:47.850
Never.

1015
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.450
What about twice in one day?

1016
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:52.450
You got ten G's?

1017
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:53.850
I got more than that.

1018
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.850
- Let me see.
- Calm down.


1019
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.050
I need you to
keep this for me, okay?

1020
01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:02.450
I gotta get out of town because
there's some strange shit going on.


1021
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:04.650
- All right?
- Okay.


1022
01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:08.150
Read the note.

1023
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:11.150
Stevie, read the note.
Are you listening to me?


1024
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:14.750
Oh, yeah. I just wanted to let
you know I'm looking up to you.


1025
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:16.250
I look up to you.

1026
01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:19.250
Look up to me another time, all right?
Stevie?


1027
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:21.450
I need you to do the right thing.

1028
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:30.250
Be careful, Alvin. For sure.

1029
01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:36.950
Shit!

1030
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:43.150
I want both mobile units to maintain
visual contact. If he leaves town...


1031
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:46.450
l want to know where he's going
before he does.


1032
01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:48.650
What if our killer can't find him?

1033
01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:51.150
We'll just have to make sure he can.

1034
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:04.650
Oh, my nuts.

1035
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:08.750
My balls. My balls.

1036
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:14.350
Okay, tickets.

1037
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:25.650
Is that you, Alveen?

1038
01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:28.450
Alveen!

1039
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.450
- Shut up.
- Get your ass in here!


1040
01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:39.350
My name is Alvin, not "Alveen".

1041
01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:43.250
How could you give out
my e-mail address? That is personal.


1042
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:46.150
I don't even know it,
and if I did...


1043
01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:48.150
nobody wants to talk you.

1044
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:52.950
You must've given it to somebody.
There's a message in your name.


1045
01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:55.850
And nobody just breaks into Netscape.
Okay?


1046
01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:57.950
Nobody is that smart.

1047
01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:03.650
"Hello, Alvin, it seems
we have some unfinished business.


1048
01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:06.750
Unfortunately, your phones
are being tapped...


1049
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.350
and you're being followed".

1050
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:11.150
Someone's been listening...

1051
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:13.250
Tika, not now, not now.

1052
01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:15.350
"You have a beautiful son.

1053
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:19.450
It would be a shame if you didn't
follow these instructions.


1054
01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.150
Leave the apartment
at exactly 4 p.m...


1055
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.450
and go to the following address".

1056
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:27.050
He's moving.

1057
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:31.350
"Take a taxi to the Fifth Avenue
and 53rd Street subway station.


1058
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:34.050
Get on the first subway car you see".

1059
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:37.550
Here we go.
I want to make this clear at the top:


1060
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:39.450
I prefer the suspect alive.

1061
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:42.750
But if anything goes wrong,
don't hesitate.


1062
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:44.450
Take him out, no matter what.

1063
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:47.250
If the only way to get to him
is through Alvin...


1064
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.050
so be it.

1065
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:51.050
You shoot...

1066
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.250
l'll answer the letters.

1067
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.850
Just give me 60 minutes, people,
without any fuckups...


1068
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:58.850
you can have a nice vacation.

1069
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:02.250
One more block and he gets a cab.

1070
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:12.950
Be alert.

1071
01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:17.150
This guy may not wait for Alvin
to get to the rendezvous point.


1072
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:18.550
Got you.

1073
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:32.150
He's headed your way.
He'll be there in three minutes.


1074
01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:34.050
No problem.

1075
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:43.150
Well, I'm not certain that's
entirely accurate, Agent Wooly.


1076
01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:45.950
Arms at your side.

1077
01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.950
Let's take a little walk, shall we?

1078
01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:10.050
Alvin's passed Wooly,
but there's no confirmation.


1079
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:12.050
His radio's out, sir.

1080
01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:14.150
What do you mean, his radio's out?

1081
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:16.850
- I just talked to him.
- There's no response.


1082
01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:20.950
- Well, what about Sanders?
- He's proceeding exactly as told.


1083
01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.550
What's next? The subway?

1084
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:24.350
Train's just arriving.

1085
01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:31.850
Alert Wood and Boyle, and keep
trying Wooly. I'm headed out.


1086
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:00.850
IKeep your eyes open, everybody.
He's at the phone booth.


1087
01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:02.750
We 're in position.

1088
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:22.150
I'm at the red bench.

1089
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:26.950
They're all red benches.

1090
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:32.050
That's him. This is it.
This is it. Let's go!


1091
01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:34.250
Out of the way!

1092
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:41.350
Stop right there!
I said, stop your car right there!


1093
01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:44.450
Out of my way!

1094
01:21:58.650 --> 01:21:59.750
Watch his hands.

1095
01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:06.950
Game's over.

1096
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:09.650
I'm just sitting on the bench.

1097
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:13.850
Cordon off the area.
Cordon off the area! Go!


1098
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:17.650
What in the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?


1099
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:22.250
I heard y'all were giving away $5000.
I thought I'd come and get me some.


1100
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:26.350
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

1101
01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.350
My brother gave me money and a note...

1102
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:33.250
to e-mail him some fucked-up
James Bond shit and meet him here.


1103
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:34.850
Ain't no crime in that.

1104
01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.850
- Alvin set this up?
- Damn, you getting smarter.


1105
01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:45.550
You think this is a game? You and
your stupid brother, you asshole.


1106
01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:48.250
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.


1107
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:51.050
He ain't too stupid.
He got your ass down here.


1108
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:05.150
This is just, you know, fried hummus.

1109
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:07.150
- Piece of shit!
- You!


1110
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:08.850
Get your hands off me.

1111
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:14.050
I'm just trying to get a ride.

1112
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:15.950
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

1113
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:17.950
You promised we'd go to the track.

1114
01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:21.450
She's not running till the 7th race.
Get in the fucking car.


1115
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:26.350
You owe me a falafel, motherfucker.

1116
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:36.050
This the wrong time for this.
I need to go to the crib right now.


1117
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:38.750
You won't be seeing home
for a long time.


1118
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:41.650
How many times I gotta say
I don't know where Stevie is?


1119
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.550
Fuck Stevie, okay?
This is about you.


1120
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:48.650
This is about you and your friend
who buzzed me with that thing.


1121
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:51.750
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's after me.


1122
01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:56.450
- How'd you do that?
- What?


1123
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:59.850
- What the fuck? How'd you do that?
- How'd I do what?


1124
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:01.350
That came out of the radio.

1125
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:04.950
- He's a ventriloquist, this guy.
- A what?


1126
01:24:05.150 --> 01:24:08.050
- You know, the guy does the shit...
- Like a DJ?


1127
01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:10.850
- Hello?
- Like the guys with the dummies.


1128
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:14.050
You know, with the voices
and the dummies and shit.


1129
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:18.050
Yeah, yeah. He didn't tell you?
I'm a ventriloquist.


1130
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:20.550
We're traveling in a black Mercedes...

1131
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:24.350
with two Bert-and-Ernie-
looking motherfuckers inside...


1132
01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:25.550
on Madison Ave.

1133
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:29.650
Look at you. You suck.
I could see your lips moving.


1134
01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:33.450
We about to move past 59th Street.
I'm gonna need backup.


1135
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:35.950
I'm gonna need backup. One Adam-12.

1136
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:38.550
Code three. I need backup.
I need backup.


1137
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:39.950
Who's he talking to?

1138
01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:41.550
Emergency, I need backup.

1139
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:43.150
Shut him the fuck up!

1140
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:50.950
We got a problem.

1141
01:24:53.850 --> 01:24:56.550
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck me!

1142
01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:03.950
What are you doing?

1143
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:07.050
Don't point that gun at me!
Don't point that gun at me!


1144
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:12.650
- You shot me, bitch.
- Look out for the bus!


1145
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:50.750
Oh, God, please!

1146
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:53.950
God, give me strength!

1147
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:02.350
Oh, shit!

1148
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:06.250
- Shoot the bag!
- All right, look out.


1149
01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:10.450
God, I can't breathe. 
Open the door!

1150
01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:13.550
Where you going?
Alvin, get back here.


1151
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.450
Get back here. Help us out!

1152
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:23.150
- I lost mobility.
- Just look at my car!


1153
01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:27.050
I hate this guy.
He's the fucking devil.


1154
01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:28.950
Alvin Sanders is the devil.

1155
01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:39.150
What are you doing? 
Open the window.

1156
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:42.750
What are we, goldfish?
Help us out of here!


1157
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:49.250
It's a blackout situation.
We are negative on all signals.


1158
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:53.950
Scanning visual matrix.

1159
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:57.550
Negative.

1160
01:26:57.950 --> 01:27:01.250
- We could try to isolate a pitch.
- It's a million-to-one shot.


1161
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:06.450
I would like to make a deal with
the United States Treasury Department.


1162
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.250
Sir?

1163
01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:11.650
- It's Wooly's channel.
- Can we trace it?


1164
01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:14.650
I'd like to trade the life
ofa Treasury agent...


1165
01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:16.650
for the 42 million in gold.

1166
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:17.950
Transferring signal.

1167
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:22.450
Since you don't have my gold,
I'll settle for the next best thing.


1168
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:27.350
If you want Mr. Wooly alive,
turn over Mr. Sanders to me.


1169
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:30.150
Midtown Winslett, 36th Street.

1170
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:29.250
Lisa, what's wrong with you?

1171
01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:36.250
Girl, what's wrong with you?

1172
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:03.050
Alvin! Alvin, get up, baby.

1173
01:29:13.150 --> 01:29:15.050
Please get up.

1174
01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:20.950
Baby, get up. Come on, Alvin.

1175
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:25.550
Come on, come on, please get up.
Alvin, please get up.


1176
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:28.350
Why are you doing this to us?

1177
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:31.150
Why? Why are you doing this to us?

1178
01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:21.050
Give us a break.

1179
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:39.350
Did you have a nice sleep?

1180
01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:41.350
What'd you do with Lisa?

1181
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:43.850
I put her in the other room
with Gregory.


1182
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:46.350
They're fine.

1183
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:50.650
This is New York. We don't play
these type of games here.


1184
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.650
You see, Alvin,
I just want what's mine.


1185
01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:56.950
I was used by the government,
and now they're using you.


1186
01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:59.550
I have nothing
to do with the government.


1187
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:01.250
Oh, yes, you do.

1188
01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:03.950
They used you to get to me...

1189
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:06.650
and I might add, quite effectively.

1190
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:08.250
Here I am.

1191
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:10.750
Now for your sake...

1192
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:14.350
let's hope you can help me
find my gold.


1193
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:16.750
Gold?

1194
01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:36.350
Give me a pen.

1195
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:46.250
I would like to make a deal with
the United States Treasury Department.


1196
01:31:46.450 --> 01:31:47.450
That son of a bitch.

1197
01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:49.750
I'd like to trade the life
ofa Treasury agent...


1198
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:52.250
He knew Alvin was being surveilled.

1199
01:31:53.850 --> 01:31:57.350
This whole thing was just a diversion.

1200
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:59.650
If you want Mr. Wooly...

1201
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:04.550
All right, the drill is simple.

1202
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:08.350
We find Alvin before he does.

1203
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:11.650
The math on this
is extremely problematic.


1204
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:13.250
You have information.

1205
01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:15.850
I need it.

1206
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:19.550
You don't provide that information,
I have to kill you.


1207
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:27.950
What are my options?

1208
01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:30.750
Well....

1209
01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:36.850
Obviously...

1210
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:39.550
there's torture.

1211
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:41.450
No, come on.

1212
01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:44.450
You're more creative than that.
That's...uh-uh.


1213
01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.650
That's a point well taken, Alvin.

1214
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:58.850
And besides, torture...

1215
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.150
it's unpleasant.
- Yeah.


1216
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:04.050
- It's loud.
- You're right.


1217
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:06.350
So unpredictable.

1218
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:08.150
Wait, no, hold on. No, wait.

1219
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:13.550
See...

1220
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:15.650
did that really hurt?

1221
01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:18.650
And if so, how much?
Nobody really knows.


1222
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:21.750
But I will tell you this:
I do not have the time...


1223
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:25.850
l do not have the manpower, and
I do not have the assets for error.


1224
01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:29.150
Do you understand that?
Do you get that?


1225
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:33.050
I am tired of fucking around
with you, Alvin!


1226
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:38.850
When you get your money, you need
to get an anger management class.


1227
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:42.250
You! No, you're not very smart,
are you?


1228
01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:45.950
The only reason you're alive
is because I allow it!


1229
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:49.250
Shut up! Shut up!

1230
01:34:01.650 --> 01:34:04.250
You like little kids, right?
That's my boy in there.


1231
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:05.950
I can't let nothing happen to him.

1232
01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:09.250
It don't matter what's going
on between us.


1233
01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:10.450
I'll do anything.

1234
01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:13.750
He ain't got nothing to do with this.
It's between us.


1235
01:34:14.150 --> 01:34:15.550
Let's make this shit work.

1236
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.650
Let's go get that gold, man.

1237
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:32.350
I'm sorry for that primitive outburst.

1238
01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:37.350
I've decided the best course
of action...


1239
01:34:37.650 --> 01:34:42.550
is to contrast the fear of certain
death with an indulgent incentive.


1240
01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:46.150
Force you to choose
between the extremes.


1241
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:50.950
I'm prepared to offer you
the same deal I had with Jaster.


1242
01:34:52.650 --> 01:34:57.050
We find the gold, you get to keep
six bricks to do with as you please.


1243
01:34:58.050 --> 01:34:59.950
Roughly one million dollars.

1244
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:03.050
And, Alvin...

1245
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:07.850
it's a one-time,
non-negotiable offer.


1246
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:18.650
All right, let me get this straight:

1247
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:21.850
The offer is a million dollars...

1248
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:23.850
or you kill me.

1249
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:26.150
Correct.

1250
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:31.250
A million ain't what it used to be
with taxes. If that's all you got...


1251
01:35:31.450 --> 01:35:33.150
we'll work with that.

1252
01:35:33.850 --> 01:35:35.150
Clear.

1253
01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:56.850
What is that?

1254
01:35:59.550 --> 01:36:01.150
It's coffee, sir.

1255
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:04.250
I wonder why he didn't kill him.

1256
01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:05.750
Alvin must've talked.

1257
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:07.050
He doesn't know anything.

1258
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:10.050
I didn't say he knew anything.
I just said he talked.


1259
01:36:11.050 --> 01:36:12.250
Secure the building.

1260
01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:15.550
Check the stairwell to the roof.
Take more men.


1261
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:18.850
All right, let's go.

1262
01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:33.350
She gonna be all right, right?

1263
01:36:34.650 --> 01:36:37.750
She will be, if you do
what you're supposed to do.


1264
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:40.750
You're gonna have to trust me.

1265
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:45.450
I could trust you a lot better
if you would let my girl and kid go.


1266
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:48.050
No, no, no. I couldn't do that.

1267
01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:51.250
Lisa and your little boy
are motivational tools.


1268
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:59.450
Air Unit, what do you got?

1269
01:36:59.650 --> 01:37:00.650
We got nothing.

1270
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:03.850
- Do a sweep on channel 34.
- Affirmative.


1271
01:37:04.150 --> 01:37:06.150
- Night vision.
- Negative.


1272
01:37:06.450 --> 01:37:07.750
- Infrared.
- Negative.


1273
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:09.550
- We got nothing.
- No signal.


1274
01:37:09.850 --> 01:37:13.450
Jesus! Alvin Sanders is a needle
in a haystack.


1275
01:37:18.850 --> 01:37:20.050
Can I help you?

1276
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:26.250
All right, Detective Wooly, go ahead.

1277
01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:38.950
The horses for the fifth race
are on the track.


1278
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:03.450
And they're off.

1279
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:20.150
Let's see what we have here.

1280
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:24.250
What are you doing? I told you it's
in the back stables, not here.


1281
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:26.350
I understand.

1282
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:29.650
Do you think he hid the shit
in a concession stand?


1283
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:39.650
This is perfect.

1284
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:42.150
Glad you like it.

1285
01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:49.550
Hey...

1286
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:50.950
hey, little man.

1287
01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:55.250
Daddy got to run out
and take care of some business.


1288
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:59.850
I'll be right back. You take care
of your mother, okay?


1289
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:06.250
I'm waiting, Alvin.

1290
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:08.050
Yeah, I'm coming.

1291
01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:10.650
All right, little player.

1292
01:39:26.650 --> 01:39:28.350
What the hell is that?

1293
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:33.450
While I have no doubt about
your sincerity, if there is no gold...


1294
01:39:33.650 --> 01:39:37.350
l'm sure you'd agree,
there should be some penalty.


1295
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:42.250
We don't need these anymore...

1296
01:39:42.450 --> 01:39:46.450
considering there's no way my
little toy can be disarmed without me.


1297
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:49.850
All right, Alvin.

1298
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:55.350
Lead the way.

1299
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:59.850
I told you the shit wasn't over here.
It's in the back, in the stalls.


1300
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:02.450
What if we don't get back in time?

1301
01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:04.650
We gonna end up killing 5000 people.

1302
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:08.550
Perhaps we shouldn't be standing
around chatting, then.


1303
01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:11.450
Mess around and I'll tell you what:

1304
01:40:11.650 --> 01:40:15.450
Anything happen to my kid or girl,
it's gonna be bad for you.


1305
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:32.050
The horses are on the track.
It's a major race for 4-year-olds.


1306
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:33.550
How much gold is there?

1307
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:36.150
Roughly 42 million dollars.

1308
01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:39.950
You the lncredible Hulk? How you
getting all this gold out of here?


1309
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:47.350
Here.

1310
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.250
Yeah. This is it.

1311
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:59.350
All right, here we are.
Right here. Nine.


1312
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:01.950
No, no, no, no.

1313
01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:04.350
No, it's not very logical.

1314
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:05.650
Logical or not...

1315
01:41:05.850 --> 01:41:09.250
it's buried in the back.
Don't get it if you don't have to.


1316
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:11.150
I gotta get to my family.

1317
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:14.750
- I ain't gotta do shit for you...
- All right, open it.


1318
01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:18.250
You can open it yourself.
I don't give a damn.


1319
01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:19.250
Open it!

1320
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:32.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1321
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:34.250
It's all right.

1322
01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:37.850
It's all right, big fella.

1323
01:41:38.150 --> 01:41:39.550
Calm down, now. Calm down.

1324
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:42.650
Hold on, now.
Just calm down. It's all right.


1325
01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:47.150
Easy, easy, easy, it's all right.
It's all right. Calm down.


1326
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:32.350
What the hell is that?

1327
01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.950
Where's my fucking gold, Alvin?

1328
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:40.650
You soft.

1329
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:49.650
We got him.

1330
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:53.250
He's at the Manhattan Race Track.

1331
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:55.850
Get yo bitch ass up. Get up!

1332
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:59.050
Get some of this, huh?
Get some of this, huh?


1333
01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:00.950
Chest, chest, chest, nuts!

1334
01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:07.150
Oh, shit.

1335
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:13.950
The horses are now leaving
the paddock for the race.


1336
01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:54.650
The horses are now all in the gate.

1337
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:59.650
And they're off.

1338
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:03.350
Bitch!

1339
01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:11.150
Alvin!

1340
01:44:19.450 --> 01:44:24.050
Frigid Pleasure in front
setting a blistering pace.


1341
01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:28.150
Come on, Frigid Pleasure,
you motherfucker!


1342
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:33.350
That's my horse! 
That's my horse!

1343
01:44:35.250 --> 01:44:36.550
Shit!

1344
01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:41.250
What the fuck?

1345
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:45.050
- There's another horse on the field.
- Slow down, slow down!


1346
01:44:49.050 --> 01:44:50.350
We need security!

1347
01:44:51.250 --> 01:44:53.150
Move! I can't control this shit!

1348
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:57.250
The horses are still heading
for the wire!


1349
01:44:57.450 --> 01:44:58.850
This is disastrous!

1350
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:00.250
You gotta stop!

1351
01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:04.450
Ramirez tries to hold Frigid Pleasure,
but the horse has a mind ofits own!


1352
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:06.750
Look out!

1353
01:45:19.450 --> 01:45:21.550
Get out of the way!
I can't control her!


1354
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:24.750
All the horses and riders are down!

1355
01:45:25.050 --> 01:45:26.750
You don't listen, do you?

1356
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:29.950
You can slow down now.

1357
01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:31.050
We coming to a railing.

1358
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:35.050
Do you see the people? Don't you see
the people? Put the brakes on.


1359
01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:42.250
Couldn't be.

1360
01:45:43.150 --> 01:45:44.350
It's him.

1361
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:46.950
It's the devil.

1362
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:53.450
In my 30 years ofracing...

1363
01:45:53.650 --> 01:45:57.050
l've never witnessed
a spectacle quite like this.


1364
01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.450
Get out of the way!

1365
01:45:58.550 --> 01:46:00.750
Police! Move! Move!

1366
01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:03.750
Look out!

1367
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:14.950
Get out of the way!

1368
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:39.250
Excuse me.

1369
01:46:40.150 --> 01:46:41.550
Get out of the way!

1370
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:43.950
Back up! Back up!

1371
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:47.550
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Excuse me!


1372
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:49.050
Damn!

1373
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:59.850
Hold it right there!

1374
01:47:00.850 --> 01:47:01.850
Freeze!

1375
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:14.550
He's jumped. He's jumped.

1376
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:30.250
Lisa! Lisa, baby.

1377
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:33.450
Lisa, Lisa. Wake up, baby. Wake up.

1378
01:47:34.450 --> 01:47:37.550
- I'm getting him out.
- What are you doing with Gregory?


1379
01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:48.750
I know, I know, I know....

1380
01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:54.450
Hold on. I'm gonna be
right there. Calm down, okay?


1381
01:47:54.650 --> 01:47:56.550
I'll be right back to get you.

1382
01:47:58.850 --> 01:48:00.250
Lisa, you got to wake up.

1383
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:02.250
Ain't nothing wrong with the baby.

1384
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:03.750
We got a situation.

1385
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:05.550
What is that?

1386
01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:08.450
- That's a bomb, baby.
- A bomb?


1387
01:48:08.650 --> 01:48:12.850
- It's a kaboom bomb, not a kapow bomb.
- That's a really big bomb. Pull it!


1388
01:48:13.150 --> 01:48:14.050
Pull it!

1389
01:48:22.450 --> 01:48:24.150
Come on, Alvin.

1390
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:28.750
Where's the baby? I can hear him.
Where's my baby, Alvin?


1391
01:48:29.050 --> 01:48:31.050
What's that? What's that?

1392
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:34.350
All right. Turn your head.

1393
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:37.350
Hurry up. Come on.
What's going on?


1394
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:39.650
Turn your face!

1395
01:48:39.850 --> 01:48:42.250
Oh, God, Alvin. 
Where's the baby?

1396
01:48:42.450 --> 01:48:45.950
Come on and burn it. Get it out.
Where's the...


1397
01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:53.150
I can hear the baby.
Where's my baby, Alvin?


1398
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:54.850
Shit!

1399
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:58.150
Just take the baby.
Just take the baby and run.


1400
01:49:04.150 --> 01:49:07.150
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go get the baby now!


1401
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:13.750
- Get him! I gotta take care of this!
- Alvin, no!


1402
01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:21.050
Shit.

1403
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:22.850
What the fuck? Fuck that.

1404
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:26.050
Some shit I do know how
to do right here.


1405
01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:40.950
Oh, shit. Get out of the way!

1406
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:43.450
I got a bomb. You got to move!

1407
01:49:43.650 --> 01:49:45.350
Move the horses.

1408
01:49:46.050 --> 01:49:47.750
Get blown up, then.

1409
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:51.350
Move out of the way!

1410
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:57.550
Oh, shit, the brakes!

1411
01:49:58.550 --> 01:50:00.150
No! Oh, shit!

1412
01:50:00.450 --> 01:50:02.650
Running out of time. Oh, shit!

1413
01:50:05.150 --> 01:50:06.450
Brakes!

1414
01:50:16.150 --> 01:50:17.350
Oh, shit!

1415
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:27.750
Hey!

1416
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:46.950
Now, come on.
Man, you almost shot me!


1417
01:51:47.150 --> 01:51:48.450
Shit!

1418
01:51:48.850 --> 01:51:50.950
You could've fucked around
and shot me.


1419
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:54.150
But I didn't.

1420
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:56.650
Well, I guess I owe you one.

1421
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:01.850
- I guess you do.
- Yeah. Yeah.


1422
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:09.250
- Hey!
- Oh, man, this trick shoulder.


1423
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:11.550
It's from the gunshot.
I got reflexes.


1424
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:13.450
I can't really control my shit.

1425
01:52:14.850 --> 01:52:16.850
I suppose I had that coming.

1426
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:19.350
It's okay.

1427
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:21.850
Get that piece of shit out of here.

1428
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:26.150
Y'all did bust me upside the head
with a brick.


1429
01:52:27.650 --> 01:52:29.250
We did a lot more than that.

1430
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:33.550
You didn't touch me
in different places? Because...


1431
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:38.050
No. Whether you know or not, you
did a good thing for your country.


1432
01:52:38.150 --> 01:52:41.850
We need to talk about what
the country's gonna do for me.


1433
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:43.950
I ain't having a good day.

1434
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:46.250
You got some aspirin on you?

1435
01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:47.950
You want chewable?

1436
01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:50.650
You be rolling with the shit
in your pocket?


1437
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:54.150
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No.


1438
01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:01.650
You got some water?

1439
01:53:15.650 --> 01:53:18.650
Oh, boy. Look. Yes, sir.

1440
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:20.050
Hey, you two.

1441
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:23.150
Hey, what's happening? Oh, man....

1442
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:25.750
- Y'all have fun?
- Yeah, we had a good time.


1443
01:53:29.050 --> 01:53:30.550
Let's make another one.

1444
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:32.850
We had a question to ask you.

1445
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:34.050
What might that be?

1446
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:38.550
My man G has already mastered
the craft of eating applesauce.


1447
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:41.650
He's a genius like me.
We're thinking of moving up...


1448
01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:46.150
to peanut butter, but I don't want
his mouth to get stuck all together.


1449
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:48.450
Baby, he already eats peanut butter.

1450
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:52.150
Look at that. I can't believe
you had me come all the way here.


1451
01:53:52.450 --> 01:53:53.750
You done bamboozled me.

1452
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:55.050
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1453
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:58.550
I'm looking for The Bronx Zoo
by Sparky Lyle.


1454
01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:02.450
The Bronx Zoo? Did you try upstairs
in the nature section?


1455
01:54:02.650 --> 01:54:04.750
It's not about nature.
It's about baseball.


1456
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:06.250
The Yankees?

1457
01:54:06.450 --> 01:54:09.350
Yankee Stadium?
They call it the Bronx Zoo.


1458
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:12.350
Okay. Check in the back
on the left side, in sports.


1459
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:13.950
Bronx Zoo?

1460
01:54:14.850 --> 01:54:16.550
"There's no place...

1461
01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:18.550
like home".

1462
01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:22.050
I need to make a phone call...

1463
01:54:22.650 --> 01:54:23.650
to my accountant.

1464
01:54:28.450 --> 01:54:29.450
Clenteen.

1465
01:54:29.650 --> 01:54:30.850
Edgar, what's up?

1466
01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:33.550
I'm hurt. You never write.
You don't call.


1467
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:35.150
Alvin, how you doing?

1468
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:37.950
I'm doing pretty good.
About to do a lot better.


1469
01:54:38.150 --> 01:54:41.250
Let me ask you: what's your
policy on finder's fees?


1470
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:43.050
That depends on what you find.

1471
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:45.050
How about $40 million in gold?

1472
01:54:45.250 --> 01:54:47.850
- You know where the gold is?
- I might.


1473
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:49.650
Don't mess with me, Alvin.

1474
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:52.250
I got a pretty good idea
of where it is.


1475
01:54:52.450 --> 01:54:53.950
It's in the back ofmy head.

1476
01:54:54.150 --> 01:54:56.250
What's it gonna take
to get it to the front?


1477
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:58.750
- You tell me.
- How does five percent sound?


1478
01:54:58.950 --> 01:55:01.050
Five percent?
Five percent is bullshit!


1479
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:02.850
Two million dollars is bullshit?

1480
01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:05.250
Oh, that's five percent,
is two million?


1481
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:09.250
Oh, well, I see. I was multiplying
and forgot to carry the two.


1482
01:55:09.450 --> 01:55:11.450
I carried it, just not far enough.

1483
01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:14.450
What I'm saying is,
two million dollars could work.


1484
01:55:14.650 --> 01:55:16.250
I've got to explain some things.

1485
01:55:16.450 --> 01:55:18.150
Med school for Gregory ain 't cheap.

1486
01:55:18.450 --> 01:55:19.950
Where's the gold, Alvin?

1487
01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:21.650
Let me ask you something:

1488
01:55:21.850 --> 01:55:23.650
Do you like baseball?
