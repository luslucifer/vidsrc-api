101
00:04:26.657 --> 00:04:29.369
<i>-[clicks tongue] Ah!</i>
<i>-[both laughing]</i>


102
00:04:29.994 --> 00:04:32.705
<i>Let's get to your great-grandma's house.</i>
<i>All right, let's go.</i>


103
00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.083
<i>Hey, look, what is the rush, man?</i>
<i>Look, we…</i>


104
00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:39.212
<i>Dinner's not till seven.</i>
<i>We will get there. It will be great.</i>


105
00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:43.007
<i>I don't know what the rush is,</i>
<i>but I know what the delay is.</i>


106
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.510
<i>-You don't wanna tell them.</i>
<i>-No, I don't.</i>


107
00:04:45.593 --> 00:04:48.262
<i>I don't wanna pressure you into this,</i>
<i>but it's 2021.</i>


108
00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:50.181
<i>We graduate in two days. 
They should know.</i>

109
00:04:50.264 --> 00:04:53.059
<i>I know, dude, I know. 
It's just that like…</i>

110
00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.020
<i>Look, my family is different, okay?</i>

111
00:04:56.104 --> 00:04:57.021
<i>Look at my family.</i>

112
00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:59.732
<i>My father is West Indian,</i>
<i>my mother is from Ireland,</i>


113
00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:02.402
<i>and I grew up in the Netherlands,</i>
<i>until my dad passed.</i>


114
00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:04.487
<i>And because my mom</i>
<i>had passed years earlier,</i>


115
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.739
<i>I moved to Ireland</i>
<i>to live with my great-aunt Agnes</i>


116
00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:09.242
<i>until I came here to go</i>
<i>to a historically Black college.</i>


117
00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:11.702
<i>Now who's the one with the family</i>
<i>with the different opinions?</i>


118
00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:13.663
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-It's Davi for the win.</i>


119
00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:16.332
<i>-You win. You win on that. You're right.</i>
<i>-[chuckling] Thank you.</i>


120
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.292
<i>I do look forward to meeting them someday.</i>

121
00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:20.294
<i>Well, yeah. 
Well, let's not rush that.</i>

122
00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:25.091
<i>Mmm. So… so I can confront my family,</i>

123
00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:27.885
<i>but you can't confront</i>
<i>your great-aunt Agnes? Is that what I got?</i>


124
00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.305
<i>No, that's a completely different story</i>
<i>because I feel like your mom</i>


125
00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.391
<i>is really open-minded,</i>
<i>so she will be okay with this.</i>


126
00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:34.308
<i>-I know it.</i>
<i>-Ah.</i>


127
00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:36.477
<i>Okay, yeah, but my dad will not be.</i>

128
00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:38.104
<i>Well, to hell with your dad.</i>

129
00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:41.315
<i>Davi, why do you
hate my dad so much?</i>

130
00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.193
<i>You really have to ask?</i>
<i>After all he did to you and your mom?</i>


131
00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:46.779
<i>See, you know, that's why</i>
<i>I'm not telling you nothin' else.</i>


132
00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:48.114
<i>You don't forget nothing.</i>

133
00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:51.075
<i>Look… [sighs] …he will be there tonight.</i>

134
00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.163
<i>So please, whatever you do,</i>
<i>do not get into it with him.</i>


135
00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:58.040
<i>Okay? Good?</i>

136
00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:01.461
<i>-[woman] It's hot out here today.</i>
<i>-[Brown] I know, Cora. I was hotter.</i>


137
00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:02.545
<i>[Cora] You was hotter?</i>

138
00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:04.338
<i>[Joe] You ain't gonna</i>
<i>believe what happened.</i>


139
00:06:04.422 --> 00:06:07.425
<i>Brown tried to go all rotisserie</i>
<i>on us and shit.</i>


140
00:06:07.508 --> 00:06:08.843
<i>-Uncle Joe.</i>
<i>-[Joe] What? Hell.</i>


141

<i>Say somethin' else, Joe.</i>
<i>Just shut up. Shut up while you livin'.</i>


174
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.083
<i>Shut up while you got your nuts.</i>

175
00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:24.669
<i>Please, please shut up.</i>
<i>I'll put 'em in that nutcracker.</i>


176
00:07:24.752 --> 00:07:26.379
<i>-Oh, Lord.</i>
<i>-Oh, Joe.</i>


177
00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:29.131
<i>Madea, now look, I went to the store</i>
<i>to get everything we needed.</i>


178
00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:31.884
<i>You could just hold this bag.</i>
<i>I had to drive way across town.</i>


179
00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:33.719
<i>I know you had to drive</i>
<i>way across town, Cora.</i>


180
00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:35.972
<i>Every time I go to the store,</i>
<i>something done burned down</i>


181
00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:37.932
<i>or boarded up</i>
<i>'cause people protesting all over.</i>


182
00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:38.849
<i>I don't understand</i>

183
00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:40.726
<i>why they didn't burn up</i>
<i>the whole neighborhood.</i>


184
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.812
<i>We don't need that store.</i>
<i>We need to burn everything</i>


185
00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:44.772
<i>in the neighborhood down.</i>
<i>Burn it all down.</i>


186
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:46.649
<i>Joe, what kind of
sense it make to burn up</i>

187
00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.485
<i>your own damn neighborhood</i>
<i>'cause you upset about something?</i>


188
00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.613
<i>What the hell kind of sense it make</i>
<i>what these police doin' to Black people?</i>


189
00:07:52.697 --> 00:07:54.949
<i>-Burn it all down.</i>
<i>-Oh, I'mma… I'm finna punch him.</i>


190
00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:58.411
<i>Well, I'm just glad they didn't burn down</i>
<i>the church 'cause it's in the same block.</i>


191
00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:01.330
<i>You know that's right, Cora.</i>
<i>Thank God that church did not burn down.</i>


192
00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.790
<i>-Hallelujer.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>


193
00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:04.041
<i>-Hallelujer.</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>


194
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:06.210
<i>Hallelujer, thank God</i>
<i>that church didn't burn down.</i>


195
00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:08.254
<i>Madea, I'm so glad</i>
<i>you standin' up for the church.</i>


196
00:08:08.337 --> 00:08:09.171
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

197
00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:11.299
<i>-I don't care nothin' about that church.</i>
<i>-What?</i>


198
00:08:11.382 --> 00:08:13.426
<i>It's just right next door</i>
<i>to my favorite liquor store.</i>


199
00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:15.928
<i>So, you more concerned</i>
<i>about the liquor store than the church?</i>


200
00:08:16.012 --> 00:08:16.971
<i>That's wrong, Madea.</i>

201
00:08:17.054 --> 00:08:19.056
<i>Nothing's wrong.</i>
<i>Here's what you don't understand.</i>


202
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.225
<i>-Jesus, the Lord God Almighty…</i>
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>


203
00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:22.810
<i>He can turn water into wine.</i>

204
00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:23.728
<i>-He did.</i>
<i>-Yes, he did.</i>


205
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:25.521
<i>I got to go</i>
<i>to the liquor store to get mine.</i>


206
00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.357
<i>Won't somebody praise Him? [laughs]</i>

207
00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.067
<i>What? You need to stop that foolishness.</i>

208
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:32.153
<i>Come on, Madea,</i>
<i>we gotta get started on this dinner.</i>


209
00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:34.447
<i>That's all right, Cora.</i>
<i>We'll go to Red Lobster tonight,</i>


210
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.365
<i>and we come back here tomorrow</i>
<i>for the barbecue.</i>


211
00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:39.952
<i>Yeah, oh, I like Red Lobster, yeah.</i>
<i>That's where me and B go all the time.</i>


212
00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:41.912
<i>Oh, B? Who is B?</i>

213
00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:43.873
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>


214
00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:44.999
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-[flies buzzing]</i>


215
00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:48.085
<i>-Give me that bag. Let's go in the house.</i>
<i>-Is it me, or is Mabel drawing bugs?</i>


216
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:51.213
<i>Would you stop that? I need y'all</i>
<i>to go get the stuff out the car.</i>


217
00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.965
<i>Go on, get the stuff out the car.</i>

<i>Cora, I thought I felt a breeze.</i>

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.568

<i>-Did y'all ride together?</i>


285
00:11:21.572 --> 00:11:25.534
<i>Yes. I told her I was fine,</i>
<i>but she insisted on picking me up.</i>


286
00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:28.037
<i>You know I didn't want you</i>
<i>on the road in that old car alone.</i>

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:30.581
<i>-That is so sweet.</i>
<i>-[Sylvia] I got you.</i>


289
00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:32.208
<i>There's nothing like a good girlfriend…</i>

290
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.125
<i>That's right.</i>

00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:37.004
<i>-That's so sweet.</i>
<i>-Thank you for letting me stay here.</i>


293
00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:38.380

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:54.939
<i>Oh, well, she called</i>

301
00:11:55.022 --> 00:11:57.024

<i>She just got off duty.</i>


302
00:11:57.107 --> 00:12:00.861
<i>[sighs] Okay. I worry about my sister</i>
<i>being a cop with all that's goin' on.</i>


303
00:12:00.945 --> 00:12:03.239
<i>Me too, sweetheart.

304
00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:04.824
<i>-Know what I worry about?</i>
<i>-[Cora] What?</i>


305
00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:06.784
<i>-I worry about her comin' up in here.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>


306
00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:09.578
<i>With all these damn warrants I got,</i>
<i>every time I see her, I be worried.</i>


307
00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.664
<i>I be like, "Baby
don't come up in here."</i>

308
00:12:11.747 --> 00:12:13.749
<i>"I wanna hug you, but don't frisk me."</i>

309
00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.627
<i>I know that's your daughter,</i>
<i>but Lord have mercy, Cora. Mm-mm.</i>


310
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.628
<i>[chuckles]</i>

311
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:21.090
<i>-Well, she just be looking out for you.</i>
<i>-No, no. I… I got too many warrants.</i>


312
00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:23.676
<i>Sylvia's a lawyer.</i>
<i>She can help you out with that.</i>


313
00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:24.593
<i>[Cora] Yeah.</i>

314
00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.929
<i>Last time Brown tried to help me,</i>
<i>I went down to court,</i>


315
00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:29.139
<i>they told me that I
had to, uh… uh, pay a…</i>

316
00:12:29.223 --> 00:12:30.933
<i>What they call… what they call…</i>
<i>Oh, a fine.</i>


317
00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:32.268
<i>-I gotta pay a fine.</i>
<i>-[Laura] Oh.</i>


318
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:34.687
<i>I'm like, "You want me</i>
<i>to pay a fine to get a driving license</i>


319
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.188
<i>so I can get insurance?"</i>

320
00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:37.606
<i>"After I done bought my damn car?"</i>

321
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.902
<i>Hell, no, I'm not finna to pay a fine, my…</i>
<i>No. We not do… we don't pay no fines.</i>


322
00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:43.821
<i>They gotta catch me first.</i>

323
00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:45.865
<i>You getting too old for that, Madea.</i>

324
00:12:45.948 --> 00:12:49.451
<i>Sometimes you gotta get</i>
<i>some thrills in your life. Do crazy stuff.</i>


325
00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.787
<i>I don't wanna die old and…</i>
<i>That's what's keeping me young.</i>


326
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.289
<i>-Running from the police.</i>
<i>-What?</i>


327
00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:54.790
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Is that the trick?</i>


328
00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:58.002
<i>-Yes. That keep your heart strong.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Don't listen to her.</i>


329
00:12:58.085 --> 00:13:00.087
<i>-You be like this all the time.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Don't listen.</i>


330
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.339
<i>-You been teaching me wrong.</i>
<i>-Don't you listen to that.</i>


331
00:13:02.423 --> 00:13:05.009
<i>-I need some warrants and tennis shoes.</i>
<i>-That's right. That's right.</i>


332
00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:07.887
<i>No, but I called Tim,</i>
<i>and he said he's on his way as well.</i>


333
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.847
<i>-[squeals]</i>
<i>-Yes, my grandbaby.</i>


334
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.892
<i>My baby is graduating.</i>
<i>Oh my God. Can you believe that?</i>


335
00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:14.768
<i>Oh, he said</i>
<i>he wants to tell us an announcement</i>


336
00:13:14.852 --> 00:13:16.854
<i>in front of the whole family</i>
<i>while he here so…</i>


337
00:13:16.937 --> 00:13:19.648
<i>-What you think it is?</i>
<i>-I have no idea, but…</i>


338
00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.818
<i>Whatever it is, you know it's good news.</i>
<i>We all know Tim's a great kid.</i>


339
00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:25.279
<i>-His mama did a good job.</i>
<i>-Yes, you did.</i>


340
00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:26.614
<i>In spite of that daddy.</i>

341
00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:28.908
<i>Ooh, baby, don't talk about him.</i>

342
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:31.493
<i>Speaking of that,</i>
<i>how you doin' after that divorce?</i>


343
00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:34.288
<i>-Lord have mercy.</i>
<i>-Yes, 'cause we know it was bad.</i>


344
00:13:34.371 --> 00:13:35.748
<i>-I'm fine.</i>
<i>-That's good.</i>


345
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.416
<i>-You sure?</i>
<i>-I'm really good. I am.</i>


346
00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:40.336
<i>No, 'cause after that divorce,</i>
<i>you was just looking… [voice drops] …bad.</i>


347
00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:41.378
<i>-Madea!</i>
<i>-What?</i>


348
00:13:41.462 --> 00:13:44.798
<i>-She was just looking… [voice drops] …bad.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Yeah, 'cause we know it was bad.</i>


349
00:13:44.882 --> 00:13:46.717
<i>I'm good. I really am.</i>

350
00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:48.761
<i>Sylvia, she represented me,</i>

351
00:13:48.844 --> 00:13:51.597
<i>and without her I don't know</i>
<i>where or what I would be right now.</i>


352
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.682
<i>Well, I just wish</i>
<i>I could've gotten you more.</i>


353
00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:56.769
<i>What'd I tell you? I told you she</i>
<i>wasn't gonna be able to do right by you.</i>


354
00:13:56.852 --> 00:13:57.770
<i>What do you mean?</i>

355
00:13:57.853 --> 00:14:00.606
<i>How she gonna do right by her</i>
<i>when she going through the court system?</i>


356
00:14:00.689 --> 00:14:02.858
<i>If you go through the court,</i>
<i>they tell you what to do.</i>


357
00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:06.111
<i>How the hell a judge gonna make</i>
<i>a decision on what you could and can't do?</i>


358
00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:08.489
<i>Hell no to the judge.</i>
<i>I ain't going with the judge.</i>


359
00:14:08.572 --> 00:14:11.408
<i>You should've come to me.</i>
<i>I'd have got you half of everything.</i>


360
00:14:11.492 --> 00:14:13.953
<i>I'd have got you half of the sofa--</i>
<i>Ask somebody.</i>


361
00:14:14.036 --> 00:14:16.413
<i>In 2004, I took
a chainsaw to some shit.</i>

362
00:14:16.497 --> 00:14:18.290
<i>-You better ask somebody.</i>
<i>-I know that's right.</i>


363
00:14:18.374 --> 00:14:20.376
<i>There's the legal way,</i>
<i>then there's the Madea way.</i>


364
00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.919
<i>That's right. 
That's right.</i>

365
00:14:22.002 --> 00:14:25.339
<i>Right, exactly. Don't follow her tr--</i>
<i>Don't do that. Don't do that.</i>


366
00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:29.343
<i>Oh, sorry. But you look like this divorce</i>
<i>is not affecting you at all, sweetie.</i>


367
00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:31.136
<i>-I'm so happy for you.</i>
<i>-Unbothered.</i>


368
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.806
<i>-That's right. You look so good.</i>
<i>-[Madea] No.</i>


369
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:35.474
<i>-But she do look good.</i>
<i>-No.</i>


370
00:14:35.557 --> 00:14:37.643
<i>-[Cora] What?</i>
<i>-You look good, but some… Mm-mm.</i>


371
00:14:37.726 --> 00:14:38.978
<i>Uh-uh what?</i>

372
00:14:39.061 --> 00:14:42.356
<i>Baby, after somebody had a divorce,</i>
<i>and they go through a bad, rough time,</i>


373
00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:45.234
<i>and they start looking this good,</i>
<i>they usually done found somethin' else.</i>


374
00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:48.570
<i>When you're trying to get over something,</i>
<i>they slip under a man with legs wide open.</i>


375
00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:50.864
<i>-Madea!</i>
<i>-Cora, I can say what I wanna say.</i>


376
00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:54.368
<i>All that money I spent helping that girl</i>
<i>pay for that boy to go through college.</i>


377
00:14:54.451 --> 00:14:55.411
<i>"All that money"?</i>

378
00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:56.954
<i>Yes, I spent…</i>

379
00:14:57.037 --> 00:14:57.997
<i>What? How much was…</i>

380
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.332
<i>-I got to go… I got to add it up.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Please add it up.</i>


381
00:15:00.416 --> 00:15:04.837
<i>It was $37.95, is what I sent to you</i>
<i>to help put that boy through school.</i>


382
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.380
<i>What's she gonna do with $37?</i>

383
00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:08.966
<i>Ain't about where it come from.</i>
<i>It's what you had to do to get it.</i>


384
00:15:09.049 --> 00:15:10.342
<i>-I see.</i>
<i>-So y'all come on.</i>

<i>Listen, we get some stuff</i>

<i>Y'all get them 'matoes ready.</i>


387
00:15:15.472 --> 00:15:17.599

388
00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:19.018
<i>[Madea] Go on, get that ready.</i>

389
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:21.228
<i>-You're right.</i>

<i>Tim, boy, I am so proud of you.</i>

411
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:08.692
<i>I mean, all that money we spent</i>
<i>puttin' you through school.</i>


412
00:16:08.776 --> 00:16:12.196
<i>-You better do something with yourself.</i>
<i>-I do. I will. I promise.</i>

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:13.739
<i>You better. 
[laughing]</i>

414
00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:14.948
<i>I believe you now.</i>

00:16:15.032 --> 00:16:16.200
<i>You remember my friend Davi?</i>

416
00:16:16.283 --> 00:16:18.035
<i>-"Davi"? His name Davi?</i>
<i>-[Tim] Yes.</i>


417
00:16:18.118 --> 00:16:20.871
<i>I been calling that baby Davey.</i>
<i>I… I'm so sorry.</i>


418
00:16:20.954 --> 00:16:22.372
<i>[all laughing]</i>

419
00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:25.125
<i>-Good to see you, Laura.</i>
<i>-It's good to see you too.</i>


420
00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:27.878
<i>[Joe] I got a question.</i>

421
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:30.255
<i>-[Cora] What is it?</i>
<i>-Why all these Negroes in this house?</i>


422
00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:31.590
<i>-Is this a homicide?</i>
<i>-[Cora] No--</i>


423
00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:32.716
<i>Y'all need to go home.</i>

424
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.136
<i>Uncle Joe, watch your mouth.</i>
<i>Did y'all finish everything outside?</i>


425
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.515
<i>I did the best I could.</i>
<i>I couldn't look at Brown's ass no more,</i>


426
00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:40.766
<i>so I sent him home.</i>

427
00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:43.227
<i>Brown went home</i>
<i>to wash the soot off his ass.</i>


428
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.064
<i>-Uh, I think it was soot.</i>
<i>-No, Joe, I don't know if that was soot.</i>


429
00:16:47.147 --> 00:16:50.275
<i>I've known Brown a long time.</i>
<i>They call him Brown for a reason.</i>


430
00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:52.027
<i>-Oh my Lord.</i>
<i>-[all laughing]</i>


431
00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.195
<i>Oh Lord.</i>

432
00:16:54.196 --> 00:16:56.323
<i>Hey, Uncle Joe.</i>

433
00:16:57.366 --> 00:17:00.494
<i>I know damn well</i>
<i>you ain't come in here in that uniform.</i>


434
00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:02.996
<i>[Cora] My baby can wear</i>
<i>her uniform if she wants.</i>


435
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.958
<i>She's an officer,</i>
<i>and I'm so proud of you, baby.</i>


436
00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:07.584
<i>Thank you, Mama.</i>

437
00:17:07.668 --> 00:17:08.961
<i>You're welcome, sweetheart.</i>

<i>You the reason everybody getting</i>
<i>to the end of the damn street</i>

<i>That's 'cause of you.</i>


440
00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.050
<i>That's what they do here.</i>

441
00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:17.219
<i>They'll back up in a minute</i>
<i>when they see a police car.</i>


442
00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:20.722
<i>Tear up damn light poles, everything</i>
<i>to get away. You better ask me. I know.</i>


443
00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.307
<i>[Joe] You need to take that uniform off</i>

444
00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:25.102
<i>and move that police car before you have</i>
<i>everybody in this neighborhood</i>


445
00:17:25.185 --> 00:17:27.896
<i>trying to kill somebody 'cause you</i>
<i>in the neighborhood. Get outta here.</i>


446
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.898
<i>I am not moving, 
Uncle Joe.</i>

447
00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:33.902
<i>If my weed man can't get here to give me</i>
<i>my weed, we gonna have a problem.</i>


448
00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:36.572
<i>Freddy coming over?</i>
<i>Tell him to get me about four--</i>


449
00:17:39.408 --> 00:17:42.202
<i>-[whispers] I'll tell you later.</i>
<i>-So you need to move that police car.</i>


450
00:17:42.286 --> 00:17:44.538
<i>You know, I… I can actually arrest you.</i>

451
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:47.666
<i>And I'll protest all over your ass.</i>
<i>I'll protest all over your ass.</i>


452
00:17:47.749 --> 00:17:48.625
<i>[Ellie] What for?</i>

453
00:17:48.709 --> 00:17:52.963
<i>Violation of my civil right</i>
<i>on January 6th on the US Capitol.</i>


454
00:17:53.046 --> 00:17:54.256
<i>That I can smoke weed</i>

455
00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.465
<i>if the weed is right.</i>

456
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:57.593
<i>-[Cora] What?</i>
<i>-Tell your weed man to come see me.</i>

<i>What you gonna do?</i>

458
00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.555
<i>-Bring him on over.</i>
<i>-Don't be threatening my weed man.</i>


459
00:18:01.638 --> 00:18:04.183
<i>-I'll show you what--</i>
<i>-Threatening my weed man.</i>


460
00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:07.728
<i>But, Uncle Joe, you would be</i>
<i>in the wrong. Weed is illegal here.</i>


461
00:18:07.811 --> 00:18:09.688
<i>I got a subscription.</i>

462
00:18:09.771 --> 00:18:12.191
<i>Uh, I… I think</i>

00:18:12.274 --> 00:18:14.359
<i>-Right. Right.</i>
<i>-Who… who the hell is that?</i>


464
00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:17.070
<i>-That's Tim.</i>
<i>-The educated one who we're celebrating.</i>


465
00:18:17.154 --> 00:18:18.864
<i>Don't correct him. 
He's stupid.</i>

466
00:18:18.947 --> 00:18:22.284
<i>I know what I said. Don't correct me</i>
<i>'cause you went to college.</i>


467
00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:24.369
<i>I know what I'm saying.</i>
<i>I got a subscription.</i>

<i>Well, valedict your ass out of here</i>

<i>[Cora] What is wrong with you?</i>

471
00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:32.961
<i>Now, you move that damn car right now.</i>

472
00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:36.423
<i>I am not.</i>
<i>And tell your weed man, come see me.</i>


473
00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:41.261
<i>You know what I'm gonna do?</i>
<i>If I count my joint, and I'm running low,</i>


474
00:18:41.345 --> 00:18:44.890
<i>and I run out</i>
<i>'cause you here in your uniform, we… we…</i>


475
00:18:44.973 --> 00:18:47.392
<i>-We gonna have a problem.</i>
<i>-[Ellie] You know what?</i>


476
00:18:47.476 --> 00:18:48.769
<i>-I'mma go change…</i>
<i>-[Cora] Okay.</i>

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.112
<i>[Tim] How you doin'?</i>

483
00:18:59.696 --> 00:19:02.783
<i>Uh, fair to middlin'.</i>
<i>Nuts don't work, but they still trying.</i>


484
00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:05.244
<i>They'll crank out a little</i>
<i>now and then to make her happy.</i>


485
00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:07.329
<i>Okay… Uh, 
I didn't need to know that.</i>

486
00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:09.581
<i>What the hell you ask me for</i>
<i>if you didn't want to know?</i>


487
00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:10.624
<i>-Fair enough.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>


488
00:19:10.707 --> 00:19:12.960
<i>-This is my friend Davi.</i>
<i>-[Davi] Hello, sir.</i>


489
00:19:13.043 --> 00:19:15.545
<i>Get your hand away.</i>
<i>You ain't heard of COVID-1920.</i>


490
00:19:15.629 --> 00:19:17.422
<i>I tried to tell you. 
[chuckles]</i>

491
00:19:17.506 --> 00:19:19.508
<i>-[Davi clears throat]</i>
<i>-[Tim sighs]</i>


492
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.510
<i>Why… why you… why you talk so funny?</i>

493
00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:23.095
<i>I'm from Europe.</i>

494
00:19:23.178 --> 00:19:25.973
<i>Oh, you're from Europe?</i>
<i>That why your pants so tight?</i>

<i>What? Son, I can see your camel toe.</i>

496

<i>Your generation</i>
<i>is turning nuts into nutmeg. Just powder.</i>


499
00:19:37.192 --> 00:19:40.028
<i>Back in the day, we had nuts.</i>
<i>We had balls. We had sacks.</i>


500
00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:42.990
<i>Now everybody just got powder.</i>
<i>Y'all ain't got no balls.</i>

507
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:04.303
<i>He liked them tight britches.</i>
<i>He had a camel toe too.</i>


508
00:20:04.386 --> 00:20:06.221
<i>Joe, leave them damn children alone.</i>

509

<i>Don't break your fingernail.</i>

1034
00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:32.881
<i>Yes, he's goin' home</i>

1036
00:41:35.968 --> 00:41:38.721

<i>He went to school here,</i>


1037
00:41:38.804 --> 00:41:41.140
<i>and then he comes home</i>
<i>and takes over the family farm.</i>


1038
00:41:41.223 --> 00:41:42.516
<i>He's a good boy.</i>

1039

<i>Uh, yeah, he is.</i>

1040

00:41:46.562 --> 00:41:47.730
<i>That he's a good boy?</i>

1042

1048
00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:11.503
<i>[chuckles] Yeah. 
[chuckles]</i>

1049
00:42:11.587 --> 00:42:15.007

<i>Is it hot in here, or is it me?</i>


1050
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.884
<i>I feel… I'm sweating bullets.</i>

1051
00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:21.055
<i>Maybe I'm going through the change again.</i>
<i>This'll be the third time.</i>


1052
00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:23.432
<i>-Oh.</i>

1060
00:42:35.694 --> 00:42:37.696
<i>[Laura] Ooh, all right, uh… [chuckles]</i>

1061
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.699
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>your Aunt Agnes is feeling too well.</i>


1062
00:42:40.783 --> 00:42:43.661
<i>I'm fine, I'm fine.</i>
<i>I just… I just need some fresh air.</i>

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:54.797
<i>-Fresh air. Maybe I get you sunglasses.</i>
<i>-Sit by me, girl.</i>


1067
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.466
<i>Tim, remember</i>
<i>when your great-grandmother shot that gun,</i>


1068
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:59.551
<i>and your father jumped</i>
<i>out of the way like a coward?</i>


1069
00:42:59.635 --> 00:43:02.805
<i>-Now that was funny.</i>
<i>-There weren't nothin' funny about that.</i>


1070
00:43:02.888 --> 00:43:05.891
<i>-Yes, it was, and I'm not your son.</i>
<i>-Hey, what are you doin'?</i>


1071
00:43:05.974 --> 00:43:07.393
<i>-[Davi chuckles]</i>
<i>-[Tim] Stop it.</i>


1072
00:43:07.476 --> 00:43:09.770
<i>Look at him, he's a coward. 
He's a loser.</i>

1073
00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.730
<i>-Watch your mouth.</i>
<i>-Richard, what are you doing?</i>


1074
00:43:11.814 --> 00:43:12.981
<i>Stop this, okay?</i>

1075
00:43:13.065 --> 00:43:15.776
<i>-Who do you think you're talking to?</i>
<i>-I'm talking to you, little boy.</i>


1076
00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:18.195

1077
00:43:18.278 --> 00:43:20.072
<i>Davi, Davi, stop.</i>

1078
00:43:20.155 --> 00:43:21.865

1080
00:43:24.576 --> 00:43:26.745
<i>You act like you don't hear this boy</i>
<i>talking like that.</i>


1081
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:29.498
<i>-What are they arguing about?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>


1082
00:43:29.581 --> 00:43:33.460
<i>He's sorry, okay?</i>
<i>Can we all just sit down and… and talk?</i>


1083
00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.295
<i>I just… I need
to tell you guys something.</i>

1084
00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:37.047
<i>-I think that's a good idea.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>


1085

1088
00:43:45.514 --> 00:43:48.726
<i>-I'm runnin' out of patience.</i>
<i>-I came… I came here for my son.</i>


1089
00:43:48.809 --> 00:43:50.686
<i>-I ain't come here for all this.</i>
<i>-[Bam] Hey, Tim.</i>


1090
00:43:50.769 --> 00:43:53.522
<i>There's a lot of us</i>

1370
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:32.262
<i>Then I look up on the bus,</i>
<i>and there she is.</i>


1371
00:55:32.345 --> 00:55:34.389
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>I know she ain't on this bus.</i>


1372
00:55:34.472 --> 00:55:39.352
<i>I saw her on the bus, and I pulled</i>
<i>in front of that bus in my car.</i>


1373
00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:40.603
<i>And the bus driver say…</i>

1374
00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:43.440
<i>[as Southern man]</i>"Ma'am, you can't
do that. This Montgomery, Alabama."


1375
00:55:43.523 --> 00:55:45.024
<i>And I was like, "I don't care."</i>

1376
00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:47.110
<i>I know damn well</i>
<i>you hear me on this bus, Rosa.</i>


1377
00:55:47.193 --> 00:55:50.697
<i>I got out, and I stabbed them tires</i>
<i>with everything I had in me.</i>


1378
00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.283
<i>Rosa, I don't… Get off the bus, Rosa.</i>

1379
00:55:53.825 --> 00:55:56.286
<i>Rosa, don't sit there like…</i>
<i>Bus driver get back.</i>


1380
00:55:56.369 --> 00:55:57.745
<i>You better open this door.</i>

1381
00:55:57.829 --> 00:56:00.415
<i>Get off the bus, Rosa.</i>
<i>I'mma get you, Rosa.</i>


1382
00:56:00.498 --> 00:56:02.083
<i>You see me, Rosa.</i>

1383
00:56:02.167 --> 00:56:06.379
<i>Get Rosa off the damn bus. Rosa.</i>

1384
00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:09.174
<i>That's all right. I'm picketing.</i>
<i>I'm taking a picture.</i>


1385
00:56:09.257 --> 00:56:11.676

<i>I see you, Rosa.</i>


1386
00:56:11.759 --> 00:56:13.803
<i>This is Madea. 
It is 19…</i>

1387
00:56:13.887 --> 00:56:17.891
<i>That's Rosa, Rosa Parks.</i>
<i>Y'all know her. I'm gonna post this in…</i>


1388
00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:22.479
<i>It's 1955, but I'mma post it</i>

1389
00:56:23.897 --> 00:56:26.608
<i>I'mma post it one day,</i>
<i>but I'm taking it on my iPhone.</i>


1390
00:56:26.691 --> 00:56:29.068
<i>I mean my aPhone</i>
<i>‘cause they didn't have iPhone back then,</i>


1391
00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.571
<i>‘cause it was A before I, but…</i>

1392
00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:33.823
<i>That's Rosa Parks,</i>
<i>and that's Archie back there.</i>


1393
00:56:33.907 --> 00:56:35.074
<i>That's my man, Archie.</i>

1394
00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:38.536
<i>She stole him from me, and I started</i>
<i>the Civil Rights Movement 'cause of this.</i>


1395
00:56:39.037 --> 00:56:41.664
<i>I was like, "Rosa, get off the bus.</i>
<i>I just wanna talk to you."</i>


1396
00:56:41.748 --> 00:56:44.542
<i>So she stayed on the bus.</i>
<i>The man got mad. White people got mad.</i>


1397
00:56:44.626 --> 00:56:47.003
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>Martin Luther King was there.</i>


1398
00:56:47.086 --> 00:56:49.506
<i>Uh, Jesse Jackson, 
Millie Jackson.</i>

1399
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:51.633
<i>Uh, J… J… Little Janet was there.</i>

1400
00:56:51.716 --> 00:56:54.302
<i>La Toya, Reba.</i>
<i>All them Jacksons were there marching</i>


1401
00:56:54.385 --> 00:56:56.429
<i>and protesting down there in 1955.</i>

1402
00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:59.724
<i>-What Rosa are you talkin' about?</i>
<i>-Rosa Parks.</i>


1403
00:57:00.308 --> 00:57:02.936
<i>-The</i> Rosa Parks?
-[Madea]<i></i>No, no, her name is Rose.


1404
00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:06.314
<i>Ain't no</i>the <i>Rose.</i>
<i>She became Rosa Parks after all of that.</i>


1405
00:57:06.397 --> 00:57:08.024
<i>You know why Rosa
didn't get off that bus?</i>

1406
00:57:08.107 --> 00:57:11.069
<i>People think she was trying to help</i>
<i>Black people. That is not what happened.</i>


1407
00:57:11.152 --> 00:57:13.821
<i>Only reason Rosa didn't get off,</i>
<i>she didn't wanna get her ass whooped,</i>


1408
00:57:13.905 --> 00:57:15.114
<i>'cause she stole my man.</i>

1409
00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.449
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-[both chuckle]</i>


1410
00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:17.367
<i>[Madea] And now look.</i>

1411
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:22.664
<i>Look, Rosa Parks</i>
<i>is a whole entire Civil Rights hero.</i>


1412
00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:24.332
<i>She’s a shero.</i>

1413
00:57:24.415 --> 00:57:25.708
<i>And you know why she’s a shero?</i>

1414
00:57:25.792 --> 00:57:28.461
<i>Because I would not let her</i>
<i>get off that bus.</i>


1415
00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:30.547
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

<i>and wantin' to fight her, right?</i>


1421
00:57:41.766 --> 00:57:43.476
<i>But look at the good
that came out of it.</i>

1422
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.813
<i>Look at what has happened for Negroes</i>
<i>because of what I did. You understand?</i>


1423
00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:48.815
<i>-Cause and effect.</i>
<i>-[Madea] I did that. Right.</i>


1424
00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:52.235
<i>So, when we get to the graduation,</i>
<i>I want you to have some cause and effect.</i>

<i>That was back in the day, baby.</i>


1428
00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:05.748
<i>I was young and sexy. 
I was 20 years old.</i>

1429
00:58:05.832 --> 00:58:08.418
<i>Okay. So if you
were about 20 back then,</i>

1430
00:58:08.501 --> 00:58:12.338
<i>if I do the math and I carry the one,</i>

<i>Yes, baby. It's true.</i>

1642
01:06:40.679 --> 01:06:42.640
<i>Mabel, I'm so confused.</i>

1643
01:06:42.723 --> 01:06:45.184
<i>I don't know… I
don't know what to do.</i>

1644
01:06:46.185 --> 01:06:49.355
<i>I thought the two boys was the lovers.</i>

1645
01:06:49.855 --> 01:06:52.316
<i>Aunt Agnes, I'm s… sorry. 
I will explain.</i>

1646
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:54.485
<i>-[Agnes] No. No, you won't explain.</i>
<i>-Aunt Agnes…</i>


1647
01:06:54.568 --> 01:06:56.195
<i>So you and my mother?</i>

1648
01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:58.572
<i>We were gonna tell you.</i>

1649
01:06:59.073 --> 01:07:01.659
<i>[scoffs] He was gonna tell me. [scoffs]</i>

1650
01:07:02.743 --> 01:07:06.163
<i>This is wrong. He's… he's my age.</i>
<i>He's three years older than me.</i>


1651
01:07:06.831 --> 01:07:08.874
<i>[Bam] Wait a minute. 
[chuckles]</i>

1652
01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.459
<i>You mad, ain't you, baby?</i>

1653
01:07:10.543 --> 01:07:12.545
<i>"We the same age."</i>

1654
01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:15.339
<i>"He just three years older than me."</i>

1655
01:07:15.422 --> 01:07:17.758
<i>[chuckles] You trying</i>
<i>to trick me, ain't you?</i>


1656
01:07:17.842 --> 01:07:21.345
<i>That means y'all</i>
<i>not the same age. [chuckles]</i>


1657
01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:23.097
<i>No, that ain't what he's…</i>

1658
01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.475
<i>He trying to trick me.</i>
<i>I'm… I'm high, but I ain't that high.</i>


1659
01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:28.811
<i>Are you telling me</i>
<i>you seeing this li'l baby?</i>


1660
01:07:28.894 --> 01:07:29.979
<i>You talkin' to me?</i>

1661
01:07:30.688 --> 01:07:32.106
<i>Richard, you judging me?</i>

1662
01:07:32.189 --> 01:07:33.149
<i>Hell, yeah.</i>

1663
01:07:33.899 --> 01:07:35.192
<i>I mean, you're seeing this child.</i>

1664
01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:37.236
<i>-What? You couldn't find a real man?</i>
<i>-Richard.</i>


1665
01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.947
<i>Apparently, she couldn't get one</i>
<i>when she ran up on your ass.</i>


1666
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:41.532
<i>Damn, this is funny.</i>

1667
01:07:41.615 --> 01:07:44.034
<i>[Laura] You standing there</i>
<i>with my best friend,</i>


1668
01:07:44.118 --> 01:07:45.786
<i>but you think this is funny.</i>

1669
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:47.830
<i>You wanna know what I find funny?</i>

1670
01:07:48.372 --> 01:07:51.584
<i>Is how Sylvia helped me with my divorce,</i>

1671
01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:55.129
<i>but you the one</i>
<i>who got away with everything.</i>


1672
01:07:55.212 --> 01:07:57.047
<i>-There it is.</i>
<i>-[Bam] Tell him, Laura.</i>


1673
01:07:57.131 --> 01:07:59.508
<i>-Tell it, Laura.</i>
<i>-I got your back, baby. Tell it.</i>


1674
01:08:00.217 --> 01:08:01.927
<i>You wanna know what else I find funny?</i>

1675
01:08:02.428 --> 01:08:04.972
<i>How I'm gonna go down to her law firm</i>
<i>and tell them what she did.</i>


1676
01:08:05.598 --> 01:08:07.850
<i>And that this is ineffective council.</i>

1677
01:08:07.933 --> 01:08:10.853
<i>And then I'mma haul</i>
<i>your ass down to the court</i>


1678
01:08:10.936 --> 01:08:13.480
<i>and get everything I got coming to me.</i>

1679
01:08:14.106 --> 01:08:16.233
<i>Then we gonna see</i>
<i>who get the last "ha ha."</i>


1680
01:08:16.942 --> 01:08:18.402
<i>Yeah, I'm seein' him.</i>

1681
01:08:18.485 --> 01:08:20.696
<i>And let me tell you, this 26-year-old</i>

1682
01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.532
<i>is more of a
man than you've ever been.</i>

1683
01:08:23.616 --> 01:08:26.493
<i>And probably more of a man</i>
<i>than you ever can be.</i>


1684
01:08:26.577 --> 01:08:28.329
<i>This man sees me.</i>

1685
01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:29.914
<i>This man hear me.</i>

1686
01:08:30.414 --> 01:08:33.292
<i>And this man reminded me</i>
<i>that I'm alive and I can stand on my own</i>


1687
01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.002
<i>before you tried to gut me.</i>

1688
01:08:35.794 --> 01:08:39.298
<i>So maybe you can take some lessons</i>
<i>from this little 26-year-old</i>


1689
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.258
<i>with your little triflin' ass.</i>

1690
01:08:41.342 --> 01:08:43.802
<i>-She went off on him, didn't she?</i>
<i>-[Bam] Yeah.</i>


1691
01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.512
<i>-She went off.</i>
<i>-[Brown] That's terrible.</i>


1692
01:08:45.596 --> 01:08:48.140
<i>I guess she told you, stuck-ass.</i>

1693
01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:49.391
<i>That boy…</i>

1694
01:08:50.351 --> 01:08:52.811
<i>-That boy is--</i>
<i>-Is gonna be her husband.</i>


1695
01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:53.938
<i>[Brown] Oh.</i>

1696
01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:55.397
<i>Oh. What?</i>

1697
01:08:55.481 --> 01:08:57.149
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-Wait a minute now.</i>


1698
01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.067
<i>What happened?</i>

1699
01:08:58.150 --> 01:08:59.610
<i>-Baby.</i>
<i>-Ooh.</i>


1700
01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.989
<i>[Bam] Oh crap!</i>

1701
01:09:05.324 --> 01:09:07.493
<i>This is no time for Black Lives Matter.</i>

1702
01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.578
<i>Don't do that romantic shit.</i>

1703
01:09:10.162 --> 01:09:12.998
<i>Player, don't do the romantic…</i>
<i>He on one knee.</i>


1704
01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.375
<i>Davi, please.</i>

1705
01:09:16.043 --> 01:09:17.253
<i>Say you'll marry me.</i>

1706
01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:26.553
<i>Say yes.</i>

1707
01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.014
<i>Say yes.</i>

1708
01:09:31.183 --> 01:09:32.476
<i>And go!</i>

1709
01:09:33.143 --> 01:09:34.728
<i>What the feck is going on?</i>

1710
01:09:35.813 --> 01:09:39.066
<i>-I think it's beautiful.</i>
<i>-She's old enough to be his mother.</i>


1711
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:41.986
<i>Nobody ever won a race</i>
<i>in a second-hand car.</i>


1712
01:09:42.069 --> 01:09:43.612
<i>But he loves her.</i>

1713
01:09:43.696 --> 01:09:46.991
<i>What would you know about love?</i>
<i>You couldn't get yourself a feckin' man.</i>


1714
01:09:47.074 --> 01:09:48.075
<i>Arse.</i>

1715
01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.665
<i>-[Davi] Say yes.</i>
<i>-I gotta go.</i>


1716
01:09:55.332 --> 01:09:56.625
<i>No. [chuckles]</i>

1717
01:09:57.209 --> 01:09:59.545
<i>That's embarrassing as hell.</i>

1718
01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:00.629
<i>[Brown chuckles]</i>

1719
01:10:04.091 --> 01:10:05.634
<i>Baby, I think that's a no.</i>

1720
01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.138
<i>[sighs] I see.</i>

1721
01:10:10.848 --> 01:10:11.974
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1722
01:10:12.057 --> 01:10:14.852
<i>-[Bam] She said, "I'm sorry."</i>
<i>-[Brown] She said, "I'm…"</i>


1723
01:10:14.935 --> 01:10:16.770
<i>You could've said something.</i>

1724
01:10:16.854 --> 01:10:18.647
<i>[Bam] She said, "I'm sorry."</i>

1725
01:10:18.731 --> 01:10:19.606
<i>[Brown] Yes.</i>

1726
01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:22.443
<i>-That's like the</i>Runaway Bride.
<i>-What the hell was that? Poor baby.</i>


1727
01:10:22.526 --> 01:10:24.320
<i>[Bam] Mabel, leave him alone.</i>

1728
01:10:24.403 --> 01:10:26.196
<i>[Joe] She didn't have to do you</i>
<i>like that, man.</i>


1729
01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.240
<i>I'm sorry. You down there</i>
<i>on one knee. I'm sorry.</i>


1730
01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.617
<i>-That's embarrassing.</i>
<i>-She could've said something.</i>


1731
01:10:30.701 --> 01:10:33.871
<i>-Somethin' to him. Damn, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-She didn't want to.</i>


1732
01:10:33.954 --> 01:10:36.206
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-That's none of your business. Eat.</i>


1733
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:38.959
<i>What the hell y'all watching them for?</i>
<i>Eat something. Hell.</i>


1734
01:10:39.043 --> 01:10:40.753
<i>All up in my family business.</i>

1735
01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:44.465
<i>Well, can you pass me a beer?</i>

1736
01:10:47.259 --> 01:10:49.595
<i>-[Ellie] Laura?</i>
<i>-I don't wanna talk about it.</i>


1737
01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.638
<i>-Baby--</i>
<i>-Look, I love him.</i>


1738
01:10:51.722 --> 01:10:53.182
<i>Why didn't you say anything?</i>

1739
01:10:53.265 --> 01:10:56.935
<i>[sighs] There's just too much going on.</i>

1740
01:10:57.019 --> 01:11:00.397
<i>What? You gotta figure out</i>
<i>what you wanna do.</i>


1741
01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.650
<i>I didn't mean to hurt him.</i>
<i>I didn't mean to hurt him.</i>


1742
01:11:03.734 --> 01:11:06.612
<i>Well, then the only person</i>
<i>who can fix this is you.</i>


1743
01:11:08.572 --> 01:11:09.406
<i>So fix it.</i>

1744
01:11:10.991 --> 01:11:11.867
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

1745
01:11:23.921 --> 01:11:26.507
<i>I didn't ask y'all</i>
<i>to bring y'all children here.</i>


1746
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.592
<i>This is a party for adults, half adults.</i>

1747
01:11:28.675 --> 01:11:30.386
<i>-Not all adults.</i>
<i>-[flies buzzing]</i>


1748
01:11:30.469 --> 01:11:31.720
<i>Flies.</i>

1749
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:34.014
<i>I should have changed me drawers.</i>

1750
01:11:34.098 --> 01:11:35.015
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1751
01:11:35.099 --> 01:11:38.060
<i>Ooh, Agnes. 
You funny child. 
[chuckles]</i>

1752
01:11:38.143 --> 01:11:39.478
<i>I need more "chocolate."</i>

1753
01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:41.021
<i>-Do you?</i>
<i>-This stuff isn't kickin' in.</i>


1754
01:11:41.105 --> 01:11:42.439
<i>I'm thinkin' about giving you one,</i>

1755
01:11:42.523 --> 01:11:45.067
<i>but I want you to understand this,</i>
<i>and hear me good.</i>


1756
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:47.152
<i>This chocolate,</i>
<i>you gotta be careful with it.</i>


1757
01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:50.406
<i>I remember one time I had too much,</i>
<i>and it snuck up on me all at once.</i>


1758
01:11:50.489 --> 01:11:54.159
<i>Next thing I know, I found myself</i>
<i>in Mexico chained to a mule named Arriba.</i>


1759
01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.702
<i>-Oh!</i>
<i>-Yes, honey.</i>


1760
01:11:55.786 --> 01:11:58.288
<i>I was selling tequila</i>
<i>from between my breasts there.</i>


1761
01:11:58.372 --> 01:12:00.499
<i>Didn't know what happened.</i>
<i>So I'mma give you one,</i>


1762
01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:03.710
<i>but you gotta be responsible</i>
<i>for what happens to yourself.</i>


1763
01:12:03.794 --> 01:12:05.629
<i>-Just the one.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>


1764
01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:08.757
<i>I don't know if I should.</i>
<i>Maybe I shouldn't. [munching]</i>


1765
01:12:08.841 --> 01:12:10.968
<i>-You know you should.</i>
<i>-What is he thinkin' of, Davi?</i>


1766
01:12:11.051 --> 01:12:13.637
<i>He has to come back to Ireland.</i>
<i>His granddad needs him.</i>


1767
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.888
<i>What?</i>

1768
01:12:15.472 --> 01:12:17.141
<i>That was the deal back then.</i>

1769
01:12:17.891 --> 01:12:20.185
<i>When Davi's parents passed away.</i>
<i>Lord rest them.</i>


1770
01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:21.854
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, rest them.</i>

1771
01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:26.108
<i>-I'll never forget his last words.</i>
<i>-Mmm. What was it?</i>


1772
01:12:26.191 --> 01:12:27.609
<i>"Oh feck, it's a bus!"</i>

1773
01:12:27.693 --> 01:12:29.695
<i>[both laughing]</i>

1774
01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.447
<i>-Yeah. But…</i>
<i>-Well, it'll kill him.</i>


1775
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:35.617
<i>When they passed, the deal was</i>
<i>that Davi's granddad would run the farm</i>


1776
01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:37.619
<i>until such time as Davi was old enough</i>

1777
01:12:37.703 --> 01:12:39.580
<i>and the time was right</i>
<i>for him to take over.</i>


1778
01:12:39.663 --> 01:12:40.998
<i>And the time is right now.</i>

1779
01:12:41.081 --> 01:12:42.291
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-And he knows it.</i>


1780
01:12:42.374 --> 01:12:44.585
<i>Oh, that's sweet. 
That's so sweet.</i>

1781
01:12:44.668 --> 01:12:46.962

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:52.494
<i>So obviously, Davi's there,</i>
<i>and we just started talking.</i>


1919
01:18:52.577 --> 01:18:54.454
<i>And I don't know, it was like…</i>

1920
01:18:55.247 --> 01:18:56.957
<i>it was magical for some rea…</i>

1921
01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.087
<i>Like, odd. Didn't know it at the time,</i>
<i>but like, we just kept talking and--</i>


1922
01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:05.215
<i>Next thing, he was tapping that ass?</i>
<i>He tapping that ass?</i>


1923
01:19:05.298 --> 01:19:07.926
<i>Tapping that ass,</i>
<i>speaking that Iranian… [gibbering]</i>


1924
01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:09.928
<i>-Was he tapping? [laughing]</i>
<i>-[squeals]</i>


1925
01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.680
<i>-It's just…</i>
<i>-I'm just clownin' you, girl.</i>


1926
01:19:11.763 --> 01:19:13.723
<i>I can't have that conversation</i>
<i>with my grandmother.</i>


1927
01:19:13.807 --> 01:19:16.434
<i>That's fine. That's fine.</i>
<i>I can teach you a few things.</i>


1928
01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.436
<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>-[Madea] But listen to me.</i>


1929
01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.106
<i>I should've known</i>
<i>when I first looked at him look at you.</i>


1930
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.315
<i>That boy love you.</i>

1931
01:19:22.899 --> 01:19:23.859
<i>He does, I know.</i>

1932
01:19:24.734 --> 01:19:28.905
<i>But his great-aunt Agnes said</i>
<i>he's supposed to go to Ireland</i>


1933
01:19:28.989 --> 01:19:30.198
<i>and run a farm.</i>

1934
01:19:30.282 --> 01:19:32.784
<i>Like, a farm. 
He didn't tell me that.</i>

1935
01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:36.538
<i>-I didn't know you know that.</i>
<i>-Yeah, well, I know now.</i>


1936
01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:38.331
<i>Agnes on that shit, just so you know.</i>

1937
01:19:38.415 --> 01:19:41.585
<i>[scoffs] The shit I don't want her</i>
<i>to be on is being mad at me.</i>


1938
01:19:41.668 --> 01:19:45.005
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Sounds like</i>
<i>you need to have a conversation.</i>


1939
01:19:45.088 --> 01:19:47.215
<i>Talk to him about going</i>
<i>to Iran and everything.</i>


1940
01:19:47.299 --> 01:19:48.425
<i>Ireland. Uh-huh.</i>

1941
01:19:48.508 --> 01:19:51.428
<i>-That's what I said. Ire-land. Ire-land.</i>
<i>-Yep. You said it.</i>


1942
01:19:51.511 --> 01:19:53.638
<i>Yeah, but, you know,
talk to him about it.</i>

1943
01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.223
<i>Maybe you can go over there with him.</i>

1944
01:19:55.307 --> 01:19:56.224
<i>What?</i>

1945
01:19:56.308 --> 01:20:00.270
<i>Baby, sometime you just gotta take</i>
<i>a chance on love. Love is worth it.</i>


1946
01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:02.564
<i>You really think I should do that?</i>

1947
01:20:02.647 --> 01:20:05.400
<i>[Madea] What's keeping you here?</i>
<i>Your child is graduating.</i>


1948
01:20:05.483 --> 01:20:06.985
<i>You sacrificed for him. Hell.</i>

1949
01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:09.738
<i>And that damn raggedy car,</i>
<i>raggedy house of yours,</i>


1950
01:20:09.821 --> 01:20:10.989
<i>that ain't worth keeping.</i>

1951
01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:14.159
<i>You ain't got no man.</i>
<i>Your job is piss-poor.</i>


1952
01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:18.079
<i>-Why not just go on over there with him?</i>
<i>-Yeah, my job is pretty bad.</i>


1953
01:20:18.163 --> 01:20:20.040
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but that farm might be worse.</i>


1954
01:20:20.123 --> 01:20:21.333
<i>[scoffs]</i>

1955
01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:24.461
<i>Last time a Black woman was on a farm,</i>
<i>it didn't turn out too well, so…</i>


1956
01:20:25.045 --> 01:20:26.755
<i>But just think about it.</i>
<i>Especially in Iran.</i>


1957
01:20:26.838 --> 01:20:29.382
<i>-Yeah, I have my freedom papers this time.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>


1958
01:20:29.466 --> 01:20:31.885
<i>My question, though,</i>
<i>was that something you would do, Madea?</i>


1959
01:20:31.968 --> 01:20:33.595
<i>I mean, should I really do that?</i>

1960
01:20:33.678 --> 01:20:35.513
<i>What do you mean, baby? 
That's love.</i>

1961
01:20:36.014 --> 01:20:37.307
<i>Love is worth it. 
Hell, yeah.</i>

1962
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:39.559
<i>I wouldn't do it at this age,</i>
<i>but when I was your age,</i>


1963
01:20:39.643 --> 01:20:41.811
<i>I took some chances,</i>
<i>and that's why I live my life,</i>


1964
01:20:41.895 --> 01:20:45.148
<i>now I ain't got no regrets.</i>
<i>I got out there, and I did the damn thing.</i>


1965
01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:47.776
<i>Have fun. Just don't do nothin'</i>
<i>that's gonna ruin your life.</i>


1966
01:20:47.859 --> 01:20:49.986
<i>But at least take some chances on love.</i>

1967
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:52.405
<i>That's love, baby.</i>
<i>That don't come around all the time.</i>


1968
01:20:52.489 --> 01:20:53.657
<i>Yeah, I hear you.</i>

1969
01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.616
<i>I'm just…</i>

1970
01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:59.788
<i>Oh, I'm just scared. [exhales deeply]</i>
<i>I'm 12 years older than him, you know?</i>


1971
01:20:59.871 --> 01:21:04.376
<i>I don't think it's age you worried about.</i>
<i>I think it's the heartbreak you done had.</i>


1972
01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:06.252
<i>Let me tell you about heartbreak.</i>

1973
01:21:06.336 --> 01:21:08.838
<i>It'll spit you out,</i>
<i>make you not wanna love nobody.</i>


1974
01:21:08.922 --> 01:21:11.216
<i>It'll make you not wanna trust</i>
<i>nobody ever.</i>


1975
01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:13.259
<i>That's what I tell women</i>
<i>when they get heart broke.</i>


1976
01:21:13.343 --> 01:21:16.179
<i>If you get your heart broke,</i>
<i>please have the courage to try it again.</i>


1977
01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:18.848
<i>If that person break your heart,</i>
<i>have the courage to try it again.</i>


1978
01:21:18.932 --> 01:21:21.351
<i>Next person break your heart,</i>
<i>have the courage to try it again.</i>


1979
01:21:21.434 --> 01:21:23.561
<i>I'm gonna tell you,</i>
<i>you keep getting your heart broke,</i>


1980
01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.438
<i>pretty soon you gonna run up</i>
<i>on a heart surgeon</i>


1981
01:21:25.522 --> 01:21:28.149
<i>who know how to fix all them breaks</i>
<i>you done been through.</i>


1982
01:21:28.233 --> 01:21:30.568
<i>That's why you can't just stop, baby.</i>

1983
01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:33.029
<i>Love is worth fighting for.</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>


1984
01:21:33.113 --> 01:21:33.947
<i>Yeah.</i>

1985
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:36.700
<i>So I get it. Get your heart broke,</i>
<i>don't wanna trust nobody else.</i>


1986
01:21:36.783 --> 01:21:39.411
<i>Buildin' all them walls.</i>
<i>Let me tell you something about a wall.</i>


1987
01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:43.123
<i>It'll keep everything out.</i>
<i>Stop building walls and build some fences</i>


1988
01:21:43.206 --> 01:21:46.418
<i>so you can look over and see if that's</i>
<i>who you wanna see or not. Do you hear me?</i>


1989
01:21:48.378 --> 01:21:49.295
<i>You're so wise.</i>

1990
01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:51.631
<i>Thank you. I know.</i>

1991
01:21:51.715 --> 01:21:53.049
<i>It's the weed.</i>

1992
01:21:53.133 --> 01:21:55.301
<i>I'mma tell you this now,</i>
<i>speaking of wisdom,</i>


1993
01:21:55.385 --> 01:21:58.596
<i>when you get married, make sure you</i>
<i>say "I do" to more than one person.</i>


1994
01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.975
<i>"I do" to one person ain't gonna work.</i>
<i>You gotta say "I do" to several people.</i>


1995
01:22:02.058 --> 01:22:03.143
<i>You understand?</i>

1996
01:22:03.226 --> 01:22:04.394
<i>No, I do not.</i>

1997
01:22:04.477 --> 01:22:06.730
<i>That's why so many people</i>
<i>are getting divorced these days.</i>


1998
01:22:06.813 --> 01:22:08.648
<i>They just say "I do" to one person.</i>

1999
01:22:08.732 --> 01:22:11.359
<i>Okay, I… I'mma take back</i>
<i>what I said about you being wise</i>


2000
01:22:11.443 --> 01:22:13.319
<i>'cause I feel</i>
<i>like you're going off the rails.</i>


2001
01:22:13.403 --> 01:22:16.990
<i>If you was high, you'd be with me.</i>
<i>But let me break it down for you.</i>


2002
01:22:17.073 --> 01:22:20.618
<i>When you marry somebody, ten years later,</i>
<i>that person gonna be somebody else.</i>


2003
01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:23.663
<i>Ten years after that, somebody else.</i>
<i>People evolve. They change.</i>


2004
01:22:23.747 --> 01:22:25.415
<i>That's why so many people</i>
<i>renew their vows,</i>


2005
01:22:25.498 --> 01:22:28.793
<i>'cause the person they say "I do" to</i>
<i>ain't the same person they with now.</i>


2006
01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.712
<i>Do you hear what I'm telling you?</i>

2007
01:22:30.795 --> 01:22:33.631
<i>Take a chance on love.</i>
<i>You gon' be all right.</i>


2008
01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:36.092
<i>That boy too young to know,</i>
<i>but you old enough to understand.</i>


2009
01:22:36.176 --> 01:22:40.221
<i>You old enough to know what I'm sayin'.</i>
<i>So, baby, y'all take your time, you hear?</i>


2010
01:22:40.305 --> 01:22:42.474
<i>Now, if you don't mind, 
I was sewin'.</i>

2011
01:22:42.974 --> 01:22:45.643
<i>I was, uh, net… net… I was net…</i>

2012
01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:48.438
<i>Needle netting,</i>
<i>and I'd like to get back to it.</i>


2013
01:22:48.521 --> 01:22:50.356
<i>-Would you mind just…?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>


2014
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.484
<i>-Thank you. I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you too.</i>


2015
01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:55.236
<i>You've been here a long time.</i>
<i>It's been over a day.</i>


2016
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.740
<i>-Almost time to go. [laughs]</i>
<i>-All right. I figured my time was up.</i>


2017
01:22:58.823 --> 01:23:00.617
<i>-Yeah, but I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you.</i>


2018
01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.036
<i>-Talk to that boy, you hear me?</i>
<i>-I will.</i>


2019
01:23:03.119 --> 01:23:06.372
<i>-[Madea] Okay. Talk to him.</i>
<i>-All right. Enjoy your weed.</i>


2020
01:23:06.456 --> 01:23:08.291
<i>Eh… Oh… How you know?</i>

2021
01:23:08.875 --> 01:23:10.418
<i>You think I didn't smell that?</i>

2022
01:23:12.128 --> 01:23:16.382
<i>I got a prescription</i>
<i>'cause it ain't legal in Georgia yet.</i>


2023
01:23:16.966 --> 01:23:19.552
<i>Don't be telling your sister. Damn cop.</i>

2024
01:23:21.054 --> 01:23:22.013
<i>[sighs]</i>

2025
01:23:28.478 --> 01:23:30.855
<i>This park close at nine o'clock, son.</i>

2026
01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:34.567
<i>Nine o'clock. They trying to gentle-fy</i>
<i>the whole neighborhood.</i>


2027
01:23:34.651 --> 01:23:36.027
<i>Yeah. Gentrified?</i>

2028
01:23:36.528 --> 01:23:38.530
<i>Yeah, that's when they try</i>
<i>to make everything gentle.</i>


2029
01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.156
<i>Like gentrified?</i>

2030
01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.534
<i>That's what I said, gentle.</i>

2031
01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:44.911
<i>They gon' make it gentle.</i>
<i>It used to be rough.</i>


2032
01:23:44.994 --> 01:23:46.996
<i>That's why I go out
and shoot in the air.</i>

2033
01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.415
<i>I don't want nobody</i>
<i>to move here to make it gentle.</i>


2034
01:23:49.499 --> 01:23:51.584
<i>-I like it rough, like it used to be.</i>
<i>-Got it.</i>


2035
01:23:51.668 --> 01:23:54.254
<i>They come in here and raise</i>
<i>the property taxes and everything.</i>


2036
01:23:54.337 --> 01:23:55.380
<i>Take over your damn house.</i>

2037
01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:57.549
<i>Put basketball courts in,</i>
<i>change the neighborhood.</i>


2038
01:23:57.632 --> 01:24:00.093
<i>Build pretty house all around.</i>
<i>I ain't selling shit.</i>


2039
01:24:00.176 --> 01:24:01.469
<i>Gentrification.</i>

2040
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:05.515
<i>Whatever it is, I ain't selling.</i>
<i>I'mma hold on to what I paid for.</i>


2041
01:24:05.598 --> 01:24:06.975
<i>-Got you.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>


2042
01:24:07.058 --> 01:24:09.269
<i>Uh, Madea, is my mom still up?</i>

2043
01:24:09.352 --> 01:24:10.311
<i>Why?</i>

2044
01:24:10.395 --> 01:24:11.855
<i>I gotta talk to her.</i>

2045
01:24:11.938 --> 01:24:14.524
<i>No, your mama done had a rough day.</i>
<i>Go on home.</i>


2046
01:24:14.607 --> 01:24:17.735
<i>-What about me?</i>
<i>-What about you? Don't go upsetting her.</i>


2047
01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.404
<i>I'm not. I just wanna talk to her.</i>

2048
01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:21.990
<i>You go home,</i>
<i>get ready for your graduation.</i>


2049
01:24:22.073 --> 01:24:25.201
<i>Learn your speech, you understand?</i>
<i>Don't worry about this.</i>


2050
01:24:25.285 --> 01:24:28.705
<i>Parents are not perfect.</i>

<i>he still tried to be there for me.</i>

2190
01:30:29.273 --> 01:30:32.401
<i>And to my best friend Davi,</i>

2191
01:30:32.485 --> 01:30:34.987
<i>who never once judged me</i>

2192
01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:36.489
<i>but was always a friend.</i>

2193
01:30:36.989 --> 01:30:41.077
<i>Even though he was sneaking around</i>
<i>with my mother.</i>


2194

<i>[Madea] Damn.</i>

2195
01:30:42.078 --> 01:30:43.829
<i>-[Cora] Why does he keep saying that?</i>

2196
01:30:43.913 --> 01:30:45.957
<i>-[Bam] 'Cause he was.</i>
<i>-[Madea] He was whoring around.</i>


2197
01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.876
<i>He talk too damn much. What goes on</i>

2198

<i>[Cora] Amen!</i>

2199
01:30:49.961 --> 01:30:53.297
<i>I thought about what
kind of guy he is.</i>

2200
01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:56.050
<i>He's mature. 
He's a good man.</i>

2201
01:30:56.133 --> 01:31:00.137
<i>And I thought to
myself, how lucky am I</i>

2202
01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:03.099
<i>that the two people I love</i>
<i>the most in this world</i>

2204
01:31:06.435 --> 01:31:07.895
<i>Would I rather have known?</i>

2205
01:31:07.979 --> 01:31:09.230
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

2207
01:31:11.857 --> 01:31:14.527
<i>And I wanna apologize</i>
<i>to them for how I acted.</i>


2208
01:31:15.945 --> 01:31:19.282
<i>A future isn't a future without a past.</i>

2209

<i>And I'm just so thankful</i>

2210
01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.414
<i>For my great-grandmother, Madea.</i>

<i>I love them,</i>
<i>and I'm so thankful to be born to them.</i>


2216
01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.600
<i>And as we start this future,</i>

2217
01:31:45.683 --> 01:31:50.104
<i>I start mine standing on the shoulders</i>
<i>of regular, hardworking people</i>

<i>"Children have to live their own lives.</i>
<i>They have to make their own decisions."</i>

<i>being a Black whore's…</i>

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.987
<i>Anyway, that's irrelevant.</i>

<i>your life is here, son.</i>
