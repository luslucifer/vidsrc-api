1
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:57.885
I don't know how you talked
me into this, Tommy.


2
00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:01.635
Hell, I must be crazy, heh.

3
00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:03.937
You know...

4
00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:06.689
if the institution ever
found out about this...


5
00:01:06.848 --> 00:01:09.943
they would haul our butts
back in in straitjackets.


6
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:12.399
- Permanent.
- You didn't have to come, Hawes.


7
00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:16.283
- This is between me and Jason.
- I know, I know, I know.


8
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:19.160
But I still don't get
the therapy here.


9
00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.038
All you need to know is
Jason's dead, right, heh?


10
00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:25.792
Seeing his corpse ain't gonna
stop the hallucinations.


11
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.454
Seeing it won't,
but destroying it will.


12
00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:33.584
Jason belongs in hell, and
I'm gonna see he gets there.


13
00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:38.607
Okay, there it is, huh, heh?

14
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.910
There's his grave.

15
00:02:46.823 --> 00:02:50.202
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait a second.


16
00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:52.336
What?

17
00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:54.168
I gotta be sure.

18
00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:40.674
Okay. There's your proof.
There's his coffin. Let's go.


19
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.049
- Hand me the crowbar.
- You're not gonna open that.


20
00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:47.559
Hand me the crowbar.

21
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.388
I got it.

22
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.273
I really don't like this.

23
00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:58.959
<i>Die!</i>

24
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.675
<i>- Die!
- Tommy!</i>


25
00:05:03.877 --> 00:05:05.879
<i>Die!</i>

26
00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:08.970
<i>- Tommy!
- Die!</i>


27
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.851
<i>Tommy. Tommy, get the
hell out of here!</i>


28
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:19.393
Where are you going?

29
00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:24.693
Hey, what's that for?

30
00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:26.699
Tommy, what are you doing?

31
00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:30.495
Oh, shit.

32
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.013
Oh, boy.

33
00:05:53.343 --> 00:05:55.391
He must've really messed you over.

34
00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:04.070
Yeah, fuck you, Jason.

35
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.694
What are you doing?

36
00:06:46.437 --> 00:06:50.943
Tommy. Would you just
leave that thing alone?


37
00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:53.782
Please.

38
00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:07.714
Tommy, please. Let's get out of here.
My heart can't take any more of this.


39
00:08:16.152 --> 00:08:17.369
Hawes!

40
00:10:21.486 --> 00:10:24.740
- Don't shoot. Please.
- You in show business, kid?


41
00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:28.080
- You sure know how to make an entrance.
- Look, you gotta do something.


42
00:10:28.242 --> 00:10:29.828
Jason's alive. 
He killed my friend,

43
00:10:29.854 --> 00:10:31.877
- now he's coming for me.
- You better cool out, boy.


44
00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:34.096
- You almost got your head blown off.
- Will you listen, dammit?


45
00:10:34.122 --> 00:10:38.019
Don't piss me off, junior or I will
repaint this office with your brains.


46
00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:41.142
Look, Jason is alive.
We dug up his body.


47
00:10:41.168 --> 00:10:45.135
- I was gonna cremate it.
- Hold it. What's your name, son?


48
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:47.269
Tommy Jarvis. But look,
we've gotta do something.


49
00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:48.805
He's even more powerful now...

50
00:10:49.013 --> 00:10:51.391
Aren't you the kid whose mother and
friends were killed by that maniac?


51
00:10:51.557 --> 00:10:52.854
Yeah. Jason murdered them.

52
00:10:53.017 --> 00:10:55.019
You've been in some
psychiatric clinic ever since.


53
00:10:56.604 --> 00:10:58.284
What the hell's going
on with the weather?


54
00:10:58.439 --> 00:11:01.192
- Sorry. I didn't know you had...
- No problem, Rick.


55
00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:03.953
I want you to meet a former
resident here, Tommy Jarvis.


56
00:11:04.112 --> 00:11:06.833
- He's got some kind of prank...
- There's no time for this bullshit!


57
00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:08.954
- Jason's gotta be stopped!
- What prank, Mike?


58
00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:11.336
- Hey. Hey!
- Unh!


59
00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:14.511
That's what's known in the books as
"screwing the pooch." Iron this punk.


60
00:11:14.537 --> 00:11:18.547
No, wait. You gotta listen to me.
Jason's coming here. He's after me!


61
00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:21.838
- I tried to destroy him, but I fucked up.
- You got that right, punk.


62
00:11:22.004 --> 00:11:25.391
You listen to me. I'm sorry about what
happened to you and your folks years ago...


63
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.673
but no one in Forest Green
wants to be reminded...


64
00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:30.855
of what that maniac did here.
That's why we changed the name.


65
00:11:31.013 --> 00:11:32.981
People wanna forget
this was Crystal Lake.


66
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:35.644
They don't need some kid
stirring up Jason shit again.


67
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.904
Now, you just lie down
and get some rest.


68
00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:40.156
- In the morning, I'll call that clinic.
- No.


69
00:11:40.356 --> 00:11:43.155
If you just go to the cemetery,
you'll see I'm not lying.


70
00:11:43.317 --> 00:11:47.072
Either you get some sleep, or I'm
gonna come in there and put you out.


71
00:11:47.238 --> 00:11:49.457
You're gonna be sorry
you didn't listen to me.


72
00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:51.497
You're gonna be sorry
if you don't shut up.


73
00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.787
Take a nap, junior.

74
00:12:15.433 --> 00:12:17.481
Take it easy. It's hard
enough to read this thing.


75
00:12:17.643 --> 00:12:20.863
- Well, who told me to take this cowpath?
- Wait a minute.


76
00:12:21.022 --> 00:12:24.984
You admit the sign did say Camp Forest
Green with an arrow pointing this way?


77
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:27.495
I admit nothing without
talking to my lawyer.


78
00:12:27.653 --> 00:12:29.733
I told you we should've left
a trail of bread crumbs.


79
00:12:29.754 --> 00:12:30.852
Don't start.

80
00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:36.083
So much for the head counselors ever
getting back to the camp on their own.


81
00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:39.249
I say we stop the car, get out
and start screaming for help.


82
00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:45.047
- I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
- Darren, we'd better turn around.


83
00:12:45.213 --> 00:12:46.886
- Why?
- Because I've seen enough...


84
00:12:47.048 --> 00:12:50.643
horror movies to know any weirdo
wearing a mask is never friendly.


85
00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:01.237
Whoa!

86
00:13:01.854 --> 00:13:03.697
There's no way that we can do this.

87
00:13:03.856 --> 00:13:06.484
If the car drops into that
gully, we'll never get it out.


88
00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:08.619
Do you have a better suggestion?

89
00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:12.202
Yeah.

90
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.037
We're gonna scare him.

91
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.043
- We're gonna scare him?
- That's right.


92
00:13:16.202 --> 00:13:17.954
Just drive towards him. He'll move.

93
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.498
- Nobody wants to die.
- Well, that's a freaking fact.


94
00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:21.905
- Least of all us.
- Just drive.


95
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:24.298
He'll get out of our way.

96
00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:40.982
Yeah. That really scared
the shit out of him.


97
00:13:47.108 --> 00:13:48.610
- Oh, no.
- That's it.


98
00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:50.949
We're driving this baby
back to town in reverse.


99
00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:52.238
The hell we are.

100
00:13:55.324 --> 00:13:57.372
- Where'd you get that?
- Don't worry about it.


101
00:13:57.535 --> 00:13:59.708
- Just stay cool.
- Stay cool?


102
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.714
You ain't Dirty Harry.
Now, stop it.


103
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.300
All right, scumbag.
Get out of the road.


104
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.347
Now.

105
00:14:15.678 --> 00:14:18.101
Darren, get back in here
right now. He'll kill you.


106
00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:23.231
Not if I get him first.

107
00:14:29.275 --> 00:14:30.618
No, no.

108
00:14:43.414 --> 00:14:45.007
No!

109
00:14:47.168 --> 00:14:48.420
Please.

110
00:14:49.295 --> 00:14:52.344
Please, wait a second.

111
00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:55.100
Please. Take these...

112
00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:57.182
Please.

113
00:14:57.928 --> 00:15:00.226
You can have the...

114
00:15:39.845 --> 00:15:42.268
Come on, Dad. You can at
least have Rick drive out...


115
00:15:42.431 --> 00:15:43.478
and look for them.

116
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:45.985
Megan, my deputy has more
important things to do...


117
00:15:46.143 --> 00:15:48.441
than look for camp
counselors with car trouble.


118
00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:51.153
Come on. Can't you put out
an all points bulletin?


119
00:15:51.315 --> 00:15:54.535
- That would be wicked decent.
- Your mother own a sewing machine, kid?


120
00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:58.034
- Excuse me?
- Hey, off.


121
00:15:58.489 --> 00:16:00.787
Oh, hey. Sorry.

122
00:16:01.242 --> 00:16:03.336
Darren and my sister
Lizbeth are in charge...


123
00:16:03.494 --> 00:16:06.543
of organizing the new campgrounds
and we don't know what to do.


124
00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:09.835
And all the kiddies arrive today.
We're not ready to deal with that.


125
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.503
I sympathize with you kids.

126
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.391
Best I can do is call the station in
Carpenter and have them keep a lookout.


127
00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:18.677
I've got a bad feeling
what might've happened.


128
00:16:18.843 --> 00:16:21.312
Hopefully they're fine,
but with Jason out there...


129
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.223
- Shut up.
- Jason who?


130
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.734
Megan, stay away from him.
He's dangerous.


131
00:16:26.892 --> 00:16:29.111
I'm not dangerous.
Jason is out there.


132
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.524
He's looking for me. He's
probably headed back to the camp.


133
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.237
I told you to shut up.

134
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.323
You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?

135
00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:38.112
- Yes.
- No.


136
00:16:38.654 --> 00:16:40.452
You kids better leave.

137
00:16:40.614 --> 00:16:43.709
This boy is not well and I need
to talk to him in private.


138
00:16:43.868 --> 00:16:45.541
- Come on, Dad. We were just...
- Megan.


139
00:16:45.703 --> 00:16:47.330
Take your friends back to the camp.

140
00:16:47.496 --> 00:16:49.999
I'll let you know if I hear
anything about your camp leaders.


141
00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:52.294
Don't beat him up
too bad. He's cute.


142
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.462
Megan, leave.

143
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.507
Ooh. He's cute.

144
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:10.962
I was gonna call that clinic
and have them collect your ass


145
00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.858
but I don't want you
here any longer,


146
00:17:12.884 --> 00:17:15.507
poisoning my daughter or anyone else,
with your warped sense of humor.


147
00:17:15.533 --> 00:17:19.888
They have to be warned, sheriff. Jason
will return to the area that's familiar.


148
00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:23.915
No matter what you call it, it's
still Camp Crystal Lake to him.


149
00:17:24.074 --> 00:17:27.704
We're gonna escort you to the
edge of my jurisdiction.


150
00:17:28.454 --> 00:17:31.549
Then we will say goodbye and we'll
never see you around here again.


151
00:17:31.707 --> 00:17:33.254
Do we understand each other?

152
00:17:38.756 --> 00:17:41.600
Shit. Shit. Damn.

153
00:17:42.134 --> 00:17:44.307
I know I'm gonna get
blamed for this.


154
00:17:46.555 --> 00:17:49.274
Say old Martin ain't
a good caretaker.


155
00:17:49.433 --> 00:17:51.811
Hell, I'm a damn high
school graduate.


156
00:17:51.977 --> 00:17:55.026
And I deserve this job.
I earned it.


157
00:17:55.189 --> 00:17:58.033
Nobody's gonna find out.

158
00:17:59.568 --> 00:18:02.321
Shitheads couldn't even
stick him back in right.


159
00:18:02.488 --> 00:18:05.788
Well, I ain't gonna
touch the slimy sucker.


160
00:18:06.867 --> 00:18:09.962
Why'd they have to
go and dig up Jason?


161
00:18:10.788 --> 00:18:15.009
Some folks have a strange
idea of entertainment.


162
00:18:27.137 --> 00:18:29.310
Hey, you guys. You guys,
I'm getting worried.


163
00:18:29.473 --> 00:18:33.194
- About Jason? Ooh.
- No, about Darren and Lizbeth.


164
00:18:33.352 --> 00:18:35.650
They should've at least
called, don't you think?


165
00:18:35.813 --> 00:18:37.065
- Megan?
- What?


166
00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:39.450
- Hello?
- Yeah, heh.


167
00:18:41.235 --> 00:18:43.954
This girl's back in the jail
cell with her prisoner of love.


168
00:18:44.113 --> 00:18:45.615
Aw. Ha, ha.

169
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:47.954
Don't be messing with no
crazy jailbird, girl.


170
00:18:48.117 --> 00:18:50.495
- Those dudes are bad news.
- Oh, and how do you know?


171
00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:53.084
I been around long enough
to see plenty on TV.


172
00:18:53.247 --> 00:18:56.342
- TV?
- Yeah. Heh.


173
00:18:58.127 --> 00:19:00.255
I don't know about that guy, Megan.

174
00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:02.674
He seemed pretty weird
with all that Jason stuff.


175
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.686
You know what you need? I've been telling you
this forever. You need a guy like me, eh?


176
00:19:06.844 --> 00:19:09.723
- Guy who's not so twisted.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.


177
00:19:10.514 --> 00:19:12.516
Just because our parents
keep telling us...


178
00:19:12.683 --> 00:19:15.857
that Jason was only a legend
doesn't mean it wasn't true.


179
00:19:16.687 --> 00:19:19.281
What if he did come back here...

180
00:19:19.481 --> 00:19:24.112
looking for the camp counselor that
caused him to drown as a boy...


181
00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:30.543
searching for the one that
decapitated his vengeful mother?


182
00:19:32.202 --> 00:19:35.581
And you do know what today's
date is, don't you?


183
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:41.467
And I can think of only one
thing even more terrifying.


184
00:19:41.629 --> 00:19:43.097
What?

185
00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:50.020
The kids are here.

186
00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:56.439
Yeah, right!

187
00:19:57.019 --> 00:19:58.942
Be careful. You may fall.

188
00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:07.238
Here they are.
And they're all yours.


189
00:20:08.489 --> 00:20:11.288
Think I'd rather
deal with old Jason.


190
00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:38.235
Once we nail Roy,
that's it. Victory is ours.


191
00:20:38.394 --> 00:20:40.897
It's taking forever. I'm starving.

192
00:20:41.063 --> 00:20:42.440
That's your trouble, Larry.

193
00:20:42.606 --> 00:20:44.700
That's why your sales are
always behind quota.


194
00:20:44.858 --> 00:20:47.953
Your instinct to eat is stronger
than your instinct to win.


195
00:20:48.112 --> 00:20:51.582
- You're a real ass, you know that?
- Better than being all ass.


196
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.371
- Oh. That is so unfair.
- Oh, here we go with unfair again.


197
00:20:56.537 --> 00:20:59.040
- War is not fair.
- Give me a break, would you, please?


198
00:20:59.206 --> 00:21:01.800
- This is not war. This is a game.
- War is an ugly thing.


199
00:21:01.959 --> 00:21:05.008
- I'm hungry. I wanna get a sandwich.
- Wait till we kill something, then you can eat.


200
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.797
Calm down, would you?

201
00:21:06.964 --> 00:21:09.558
- You're an insurance salesman.
- Death is my business.


202
00:21:09.717 --> 00:21:12.766
You become this whole other
person when we're out here, Stan.


203
00:21:12.928 --> 00:21:15.977
- I don't like it.
- Hey, this is a man's game.


204
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.064
Requires a man's cunning.
A man's intelligence...


205
00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:22.233
Fuck!

206
00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:25.616
- With a woman's touch.
- Now, wait a minute!


207
00:21:25.774 --> 00:21:29.074
- I thought Burt shot you!
- See any paint?


208
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.324
Sorry, guys. I did in Mr.
Commando, weapons and all.


209
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.165
Survival's the name of the
game and that flag is mine.


210
00:21:38.746 --> 00:21:42.341
I can't believe this.
Burt never gets shot.


211
00:21:42.499 --> 00:21:45.469
- Never should've let her play.
- It's a damn company exec game...


212
00:21:45.627 --> 00:21:47.174
and she's a damn company exec.

213
00:21:47.337 --> 00:21:52.264
Now, now, boys. Don't be spoilsports.
Put on your headbands.


214
00:22:03.854 --> 00:22:07.449
Dumb broad. She tricked me.

215
00:22:07.608 --> 00:22:10.282
God, they're gonna
laugh for months.


216
00:22:10.652 --> 00:22:13.201
She should've stayed in the
kitchen where she belongs.


217
00:22:14.114 --> 00:22:17.084
A woman shouldn't even be
allowed in these games.


218
00:22:17.534 --> 00:22:20.083
It's not a game. It's life.

219
00:22:39.139 --> 00:22:42.439
Jason really screwed up that
poor son of a bitch's mind.


220
00:22:42.601 --> 00:22:45.775
He really believes that Jason's
still alive, doesn't he?


221
00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:48.032
That's not what worries me.

222
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.192
It's how far he'll go
to try and prove it.


223
00:23:29.022 --> 00:23:30.524
Darn.

224
00:23:33.235 --> 00:23:35.158
Oh, no.

225
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.288
No.

226
00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:42.453
Oh, my God. No.

227
00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:45.122
What...? Come...

228
00:23:45.622 --> 00:23:50.344
Where...? Oh, no. Oh, no. God.

229
00:23:50.502 --> 00:23:52.721
Come on out, you guys!
The game's over.


230
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.348
You don't know. 
What about Roy?

231
00:23:54.506 --> 00:23:56.099
- Nobody's seen him.
- Of course not.


232
00:23:56.258 --> 00:23:59.137
If he hasn't accidentally pelleted
himself, I'm sure he's lost.


233
00:23:59.303 --> 00:24:01.647
- Well, the game's not over till it's over.
- That's right.


234
00:24:01.805 --> 00:24:03.022
Shh.

235
00:24:07.144 --> 00:24:09.613
Wait a second. 
What was that?

236
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:11.398
- What?
- Nothing.


237
00:24:11.565 --> 00:24:13.567
I could swear I heard something.

238
00:24:13.734 --> 00:24:15.156
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, God.


239
00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:17.413
Be quiet.

240
00:24:39.092 --> 00:24:42.221
Oh, my God. My God.

241
00:24:42.387 --> 00:24:44.685
Help, guys! Help me!

242
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.102
Help!

243
00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:51.772
Oh, no. Help me, guys! Help!

244
00:24:52.231 --> 00:24:54.984
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

245
00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:59.906
Oh, God. Help me. 
Somebody help me!

246
00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:02.040
He's gonna kill me.

247
00:25:17.923 --> 00:25:21.052
Fucking-A, what did I tell you?
Hit the noise and the cherries.


248
00:26:21.778 --> 00:26:23.951
Sheriff. Sheriff, wait.

249
00:26:24.114 --> 00:26:27.209
- You gotta listen.
- I'm tired of listening to you, kid.


250
00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:29.335
I gotta... I gotta show
you Jason's grave.


251
00:26:29.494 --> 00:26:31.417
I've seen it. Come on, get up!

252
00:26:31.955 --> 00:26:33.753
- Get up!
- Please, sheriff.


253
00:26:33.915 --> 00:26:35.542
You'll see we dug it up.

254
00:26:35.709 --> 00:26:39.430
Well, he must've got chilly in the
night and pulled the dirt back over.


255
00:26:39.838 --> 00:26:43.012
That's not right.
Somebody covered it over.


256
00:26:43.175 --> 00:26:45.553
- I gotta see it.
- Freeze it, psycho.


257
00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:47.642
Now see what you've done.

258
00:26:47.804 --> 00:26:49.556
You made my deputy
draw his revolver.


259
00:26:49.723 --> 00:26:52.476
He's been dying to try out
his mail-order laser scope.


260
00:26:52.642 --> 00:26:55.942
Wherever the red dot
goes, you bang.


261
00:26:56.104 --> 00:26:58.527
- What's the problem, sheriff?
- No problem, Martin.


262
00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.738
Just a vagrant kid.
We got it under control.


263
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:03.745
- Did you cover up Jason's grave?
- What are you talking about?


264
00:27:03.904 --> 00:27:06.157
Don't concern yourself.
This kid needs treatment.


265
00:27:06.323 --> 00:27:09.167
Jason's not in his grave,
Hawes is. Dig it up!


266
00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:13.251
You gotta dig it up!
You gotta dig it up!


267
00:27:20.587 --> 00:27:21.884
Dig him up?

268
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.843
Does he think I'm a farthead?

269
00:27:26.593 --> 00:27:28.186
Yeah!

270
00:27:28.345 --> 00:27:32.020
Okay. Is this gonna be
the best weekend ever?


271
00:27:32.265 --> 00:27:33.482
Yeah!

272
00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:36.361
- Are we gonna go fishing?
- Yeah!


273
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.526
- Are we gonna scare all the boys?
- Yeah!


274
00:27:41.691 --> 00:27:45.537
Okay. Are we gonna, uh...?

275
00:27:45.695 --> 00:27:49.199
Are we gonna not eat
Brussels sprouts?


276
00:27:49.366 --> 00:27:50.913
- Yeah!
- What happened to Cort?


277
00:27:51.076 --> 00:27:52.373
Are you ready?

278
00:27:52.536 --> 00:27:55.881
He's taken the young men off to
teach them my favorite sport.


279
00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:59.009
- Heh, which is?
- Boy Scouting, honey.


280
00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:01.670
Heh. Cort? You've gotta be kidding.

281
00:28:01.837 --> 00:28:03.259
You gotta be kidding.

282
00:28:03.422 --> 00:28:06.050
Listen, you obviously don't
know anything about Indians.


283
00:28:06.216 --> 00:28:10.062
Probably none of you do. Look, here's the
story. These are called Indian markers.


284
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.393
Let's just say you have
a chief, all right?


285
00:28:12.556 --> 00:28:14.729
And he dumps his squaw
or his wife or whatever.


286
00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:18.270
He decides, "I'm gonna pick up with
another woman and take off with her."


287
00:28:18.437 --> 00:28:20.610
He takes off, leaving his
son with the mother.


288
00:28:20.772 --> 00:28:22.740
A week or two later, the son
wants to catch up with his dad.


289
00:28:22.899 --> 00:28:25.573
He wants to learn how to
shoot a bow, kill a buffalo.


290
00:28:25.735 --> 00:28:27.737
So, what happens is
he comes along...


291
00:28:27.904 --> 00:28:30.657
sees the rocks, says, "Dad,
he went that way," obviously.


292
00:28:30.824 --> 00:28:33.703
He knocks them all down before
the mother catches up...


293
00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:36.213
because he doesn't wanna
see any of her anymore.


294
00:28:36.371 --> 00:28:39.250
Pretty much, that's the basic
story. It tells you where to go.


295
00:28:39.416 --> 00:28:43.137
If this is exciting as it gets,
we're in big trouble, dude.


296
00:28:48.008 --> 00:28:49.976
Let's go.

297
00:28:56.433 --> 00:28:58.856
Like the sign says, you are
now leaving Forest Green.


298
00:28:59.019 --> 00:29:02.774
Don't forget to buckle up.
You are damn lucky, kid.


299
00:29:02.939 --> 00:29:04.657
With all the grief
you've given me...


300
00:29:04.816 --> 00:29:07.410
you should be leaving wearing
your balls as earrings.


301
00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:10.493
And if I ever see you around here
again, you can guarantee it.


302
00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:15.039
Let's get the hell
out of here, Rick.


303
00:29:27.506 --> 00:29:32.307
<i>Take you home again, Kathleen</i>

304
00:29:32.469 --> 00:29:34.471
<i>To where...</i>

305
00:29:35.972 --> 00:29:39.772
<i>Your heart will feel no pain</i>

306
00:29:40.268 --> 00:29:44.023
<i>I'll take you home again</i>

307
00:29:44.773 --> 00:29:47.993
Steven, it's beautiful.

308
00:29:48.151 --> 00:29:51.325
God, I love it. I really do.

309
00:29:52.155 --> 00:29:55.250
I don't know. I mean,
you know, I'm sort of hurt.


310
00:29:55.408 --> 00:29:58.833
You thought I brought you up
here just to... Ah, never mind.


311
00:29:58.995 --> 00:30:01.748
Yeah, well, I guess I do owe you.

312
00:30:01.915 --> 00:30:05.010
Yeah. No, look. I have a headache
and I've been working out.


313
00:30:05.168 --> 00:30:08.297
- Mm-hm. Ah.
- I'm... I'm sore...


314
00:30:08.463 --> 00:30:10.465
- And...
- Yeah. Right. Forget about it.


315
00:30:10.632 --> 00:30:12.555
Well, it's a messy act and...

316
00:30:12.717 --> 00:30:14.264
- What the heck.
- Great.


317
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:20.275
<i>Again, Kathleen</i>

318
00:30:20.433 --> 00:30:21.855
Oh.

319
00:30:22.686 --> 00:30:24.529
Where'd the road go?

320
00:30:25.313 --> 00:30:27.691
I can't find the road.

321
00:30:27.857 --> 00:30:30.360
Where's the road?

322
00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.331
Kathleen, you led me astray.

323
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:42.960
What's that? What's that?

324
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:46.501
Huh?

325
00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:01.100
Darling, you're gonna
be the death of me.


326
00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:05.066
Yeah, but what a way to go, huh?

327
00:31:22.787 --> 00:31:24.915
- Stay here.
- Steven, please.


328
00:31:25.081 --> 00:31:27.379
- Stay here.
- No, Steven. Don't.


329
00:31:46.227 --> 00:31:47.945
Steven. Steven, what's going on?

330
00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:49.447
- Annette, let's go.
- Okay.


331
00:31:49.606 --> 00:31:51.279
Never mind.

332
00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:58.999
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta get to the sheriff's office.


333
00:32:40.073 --> 00:32:43.327
- Pick a card.
- I don't wanna play anymore, Sissy.


334
00:32:43.493 --> 00:32:47.168
- Oh, come on. Pick a card.
- No, I really don't.


335
00:32:47.372 --> 00:32:49.795
Okay. Okay. I've got a great game.

336
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:52.006
It's called Camp Blood.

337
00:32:52.168 --> 00:32:53.511
- Great.
- Yeah.


338
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.640
The object of the game is, first
you take this jack of spades...


339
00:32:56.798 --> 00:32:58.141
which is Jason, right?

340
00:32:58.299 --> 00:33:01.644
And then you have all these face
cards, which represent counselors.


341
00:33:01.803 --> 00:33:04.022
The queen of hearts is me.

342
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.730
- Now, who do you wanna be?
- Oh, come on, Sissy.


343
00:33:07.892 --> 00:33:09.735
Okay, you be the queen of diamonds.

344
00:33:09.894 --> 00:33:13.444
What you do is you shuffle Jason
up in these cards here...


345
00:33:13.606 --> 00:33:18.282
and you put them in piles, because
the piles represent cabins.


346
00:33:18.445 --> 00:33:23.827
Now, the object of the game is to
find out which cabin Jason is in.


347
00:33:23.992 --> 00:33:26.040
Did Megan say when
she's coming back?


348
00:33:26.202 --> 00:33:28.375
Of course not. You wanna
bet she took him...


349
00:33:28.538 --> 00:33:30.258
a loaf of bread with
a saw hidden in it?


350
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:34.674
I'm gonna call her.

351
00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.174
Hopefully her dad has found out what's
happened to Darren and Lizbeth.


352
00:33:38.339 --> 00:33:41.218
I say if they're not here by
morning, we send the kids home.


353
00:33:41.384 --> 00:33:42.977
We're not prepared to run this...

354
00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.245
- She saw a monster!
- Who did?


355
00:34:03.907 --> 00:34:07.377
- It's okay. We're here.
- Yeah, honey, we're here.


356
00:34:07.535 --> 00:34:10.334
- So, what happened?
- There was this monster.


357
00:34:10.497 --> 00:34:14.047
And he was after me and
he wanted to kill me.


358
00:34:14.876 --> 00:34:17.675
- Where?
- He was everywhere.


359
00:34:17.837 --> 00:34:20.215
- Oh, you mean you had a bad dream.
- No.


360
00:34:20.381 --> 00:34:22.679
It was real, just like on TV.

361
00:34:22.842 --> 00:34:25.095
Okay, listen, sweetie.
What's your name?


362
00:34:25.261 --> 00:34:27.480
- Nancy.
- Well, Nancy...


363
00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:31.269
I'm Paula, remember?
And this is Sissy.


364
00:34:31.434 --> 00:34:35.564
And we're gonna be right out there all
night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?


365
00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:40.365
So no more bad dreams can
come around here, huh?


366
00:34:41.486 --> 00:34:44.786
Good. Okay, lay down.

367
00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:49.119
There. Okay?

368
00:34:49.702 --> 00:34:51.295
Okay.

369
00:34:56.417 --> 00:35:00.092
Hey, wait a minute, where's Cort?
I haven't seen him for hours.


370
00:35:00.255 --> 00:35:03.475
I don't know. He called somebody,
then he just took off.


371
00:35:03.633 --> 00:35:07.638
Said something about checking out
things that go bump in the night.


372
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.614
You're the best. The best.

373
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.374
You gotta keep it up to
the end of this song.


374
00:35:27.824 --> 00:35:29.667
How much longer?

375
00:35:30.702 --> 00:35:31.999
It's only 10 more minutes.

376
00:36:09.407 --> 00:36:11.205
- Fuck!
- Oh, yeah.


377
00:36:11.367 --> 00:36:12.744
Wait a sec and I'll...

378
00:36:12.911 --> 00:36:15.460
Cort, you didn't already?

379
00:36:15.622 --> 00:36:17.670
Oh, come on, wasn't that
the end of the song?


380
00:36:17.832 --> 00:36:19.926
Great, just great.

381
00:36:26.758 --> 00:36:29.853
If this thing is burned out, frigging
Horace is gonna have my butt.


382
00:36:30.011 --> 00:36:32.264
- Who's Horace?
- My frigging stepfather...


383
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.853
and asshole in residence.

384
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:39.445
Ah. Now, how'd that happen?

385
00:36:39.604 --> 00:36:40.981
What?

386
00:36:43.232 --> 00:36:45.200
Will you go out and
plug the cord back in?


387
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.409
- Who unplugged the cord?
- Smokey the Bear. I don't know. Go do it.


388
00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:53.168
- Do you know how cold it is out there, Nikki?
- I don't give a shit, Cort. Go do it!


389
00:36:53.451 --> 00:36:57.297
You're a real pain in the ass.
A major pain in the ass.


390
00:36:57.455 --> 00:37:01.176
Will you hurry up? I gotta get this
back before Horace finds out I took it.


391
00:37:01.334 --> 00:37:03.428
Hurry up.

392
00:37:06.714 --> 00:37:09.593
- Will you come on?
- All right.


393
00:37:09.759 --> 00:37:12.638
I'm going. I'm going, okay?

394
00:37:13.096 --> 00:37:15.690
God, shut the hell up.

395
00:37:54.762 --> 00:37:56.014
- What...?
- Cort.


396
00:37:57.473 --> 00:37:59.896
- Nikki.
- What are you doing?


397
00:38:00.059 --> 00:38:03.188
- Look at this.
- What happened to it?


398
00:38:03.354 --> 00:38:06.324
I don't know, but I say unless you
wanna look exactly like it...


399
00:38:06.482 --> 00:38:08.860
we make this place a
memory right now.


400
00:38:23.708 --> 00:38:26.006
Nikki, somebody's out there.

401
00:38:26.419 --> 00:38:30.049
- What if it's that guy Jason?
- I don't wanna know.


402
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:41.105
- No way. This isn't happening.
- You're right, it isn't.


403
00:38:45.354 --> 00:38:48.949
- You gonna drive or not?
- Whoo! Out of here.


404
00:38:52.195 --> 00:38:54.914
Shit! Damn it, Cort.

405
00:38:56.491 --> 00:38:58.164
Shit!

406
00:39:03.831 --> 00:39:05.549
Go!

407
00:39:08.377 --> 00:39:11.301
Shit! Cort!

408
00:39:12.715 --> 00:39:13.967
Whoo! Boy, this baby jams.

409
00:39:14.133 --> 00:39:17.478
Let me tell you, for a big
truck, it's not bad at all.


410
00:39:19.347 --> 00:39:21.190
That's it! Pull over, I'm driving.

411
00:39:21.724 --> 00:39:23.146
No way, babe, I wanna rock!

412
00:39:23.851 --> 00:39:24.898
Yeah! Whoo.

413
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.442
Whoo. This is... 
This is great!

414
00:39:30.608 --> 00:39:34.579
I've never driven a house before.
I like this. This is great.


415
00:39:49.085 --> 00:39:53.761
Sounds like you're having fun back there.
What are you doing? Need some company?


416
00:40:00.012 --> 00:40:01.639
Ooh, that sounds great.

417
00:40:01.806 --> 00:40:03.604
Do you need some
company or what, huh?


418
00:40:03.766 --> 00:40:05.894
Cort!

419
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.815
Whoo! This is great. I am
having such a good time.


420
00:40:13.234 --> 00:40:15.578
Ha, ha. This is great!

421
00:40:21.033 --> 00:40:23.912
Hey, Nikki, what are you doing
back there, taking a dump?


422
00:40:25.955 --> 00:40:28.253
Mind if I come back
and snatch a peek?


423
00:40:28.416 --> 00:40:30.510
Or vice versa?

424
00:40:43.306 --> 00:40:44.899
Whoo! Yeah!

425
00:40:51.689 --> 00:40:53.566
Nikki, listen to this.

426
00:41:29.727 --> 00:41:31.695
What makes you so high and mighty?

427
00:41:31.854 --> 00:41:34.198
You keep forgetting, little
Megan, I'm the parent.


428
00:41:34.357 --> 00:41:36.030
You're the child.

429
00:41:36.192 --> 00:41:38.035
When are you gonna stop
treating me like one?


430
00:41:38.236 --> 00:41:41.933
When you stop acting like one.
Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy.


431
00:41:41.959 --> 00:41:45.213
Oh, how do you know, Dad? What'd
you do, take his temperature?


432
00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:47.566
Better watch that
smart-mouthing, young lady.


433
00:41:47.745 --> 00:41:49.839
"If your mother were
still alive..."


434
00:41:49.997 --> 00:41:54.047
That's it. Out. I don't need
this tonight. Out, Megan.


435
00:41:56.879 --> 00:41:58.131
Sheriff's office.

436
00:41:58.297 --> 00:42:00.675
Oh, I'm sorry, he can't come
to the phone right now.


437
00:42:00.841 --> 00:42:03.640
He's in the can draining his lizard.
May I take a message?


438
00:42:03.803 --> 00:42:06.556
Oops, here he comes
now. Please hold.


439
00:42:06.931 --> 00:42:09.434
- It's Rick.
- What?


440
00:42:09.809 --> 00:42:12.483
- What kind of problem?
- You better get the hell down here.


441
00:42:12.645 --> 00:42:14.613
I found what's left of
those counselors...


442
00:42:14.772 --> 00:42:18.743
and it looks like someone did
them in using Jason's old MO.


443
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.580
I knew I should have done
something about that son of a...


444
00:42:22.738 --> 00:42:24.411
Where are you?

445
00:42:25.866 --> 00:42:29.416
- Right, I'm on my way.
- What is it?


446
00:42:29.954 --> 00:42:32.924
Seems your boyfriend wants people
to believe Jason has returned.


447
00:42:33.082 --> 00:42:35.676
- I thought Jason was just a legend.
- That's right.


448
00:42:35.835 --> 00:42:37.929
Only, Tommy wants to prove
the legend is true.


449
00:42:38.087 --> 00:42:42.308
Now, you stay put.
And I'm not kidding.


450
00:43:55.498 --> 00:43:56.875
Sheriff's office.

451
00:43:57.041 --> 00:43:59.794
I'm sorry, he's not in.
Can I take a message?


452
00:44:00.169 --> 00:44:04.015
Oh, hi. This is his daughter, Megan.
I met you this morning, remember?


453
00:44:04.215 --> 00:44:07.344
Yeah, hi. Listen, I've gotta talk
to your dad about... About Jason.


454
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.514
I've got a plan. But first I
need to buy some supplies and...


455
00:44:10.679 --> 00:44:13.023
Tommy, my father's out
looking for you right now.


456
00:44:13.182 --> 00:44:16.277
Something happened tonight and he's
sure you're responsible for it.


457
00:44:16.435 --> 00:44:19.405
- If he finds you, he's gonna...
- Yeah, he made that real clear.


458
00:44:19.563 --> 00:44:21.236
Megan, Jason is out there.

459
00:44:21.399 --> 00:44:23.902
I'm positive he's headed back
to the camp. He's gonna...


460
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.738
- Where are you? I'll come pick you up.
- What?


461
00:44:26.946 --> 00:44:29.449
It's the only way. If my
father sees you in your car...


462
00:44:29.615 --> 00:44:31.456
he's gonna nail you in
a second. Where are you?


463
00:44:31.575 --> 00:44:34.920
Uh, Karloff's General
something, um...


464
00:44:35.121 --> 00:44:39.126
I know just where it is. I'll see
you in a half-hour, heh. Whoo!


465
00:44:39.291 --> 00:44:40.634
Megan.

466
00:45:25.629 --> 00:45:27.802
- Okay, lift it, ugh.
- Ugh.


467
00:45:30.092 --> 00:45:33.141
I want all officers, units and
stations within a 50-mile radius...


468
00:45:33.304 --> 00:45:35.306
- alerted about this wacko kid.
- Yes, sir.


469
00:45:35.473 --> 00:45:37.851
You have his vehicle description.
I want roadblocks.


470
00:45:38.017 --> 00:45:40.566
- Sheriff, get over here!
- Shit, now what?


471
00:45:41.896 --> 00:45:43.443
Come on.

472
00:45:46.984 --> 00:45:49.112
Mike, over here.

473
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:53.999
Is that all you found?

474
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.998
I wish it was.

475
00:46:07.588 --> 00:46:09.556
I'll order up some body bags.

476
00:46:09.715 --> 00:46:12.719
Our boy sure wants us
to believe his story.


477
00:46:12.885 --> 00:46:16.014
Well, he picked the right
day to pull this shit.


478
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.807
What do you mean?

479
00:46:18.098 --> 00:46:20.942
Happy Friday the 13th.

480
00:47:10.025 --> 00:47:11.698
All right, who's out there?

481
00:47:12.528 --> 00:47:14.201
What's going on?

482
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:22.880
Think I hear somebody
fooling around out there.


483
00:47:23.539 --> 00:47:27.885
It's gotta be Cort. You know how
he loves to try and scare us, heh.


484
00:47:28.043 --> 00:47:30.171
Teach him a lesson.

485
00:48:42.117 --> 00:48:45.462
You guys, try not to wake the kids.

486
00:48:59.134 --> 00:49:00.386
I'm gonna borrow your car.

487
00:49:00.552 --> 00:49:02.350
You can't do this.
It's too dangerous.


488
00:49:02.513 --> 00:49:05.938
You gonna talk about dangerous?
You wanna leave that truck in plain sight?


489
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.352
Hide it behind the store
and let's get out of here.


490
00:49:07.518 --> 00:49:10.146
Look, this isn't a game.
You're not going with me.


491
00:49:10.312 --> 00:49:11.814
I'm already responsible for...

492
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.028
You said you needed
some supplies, right?


493
00:49:14.191 --> 00:49:15.909
- Yes, but I...
- Then let's get going.


494
00:49:16.068 --> 00:49:19.413
We can argue about it on the way.
Tell me what you need and I'll get it.


495
00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:21.915
- Megan...
- Besides, nobody drives this puppy but me.


496
00:49:22.074 --> 00:49:24.497
Now, hide that heap and let's book.

497
00:50:01.447 --> 00:50:04.200
- Can't this tub go any faster?
- You got it.


498
00:50:04.408 --> 00:50:08.379
- You just keep your eye out for roadblocks.
- Okay. There's one.


499
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.712
Get down.

500
00:50:22.176 --> 00:50:24.554
Hey! Hey!

501
00:50:37.274 --> 00:50:40.073
Unit 45, Officer Pappas to
Sheriff Garris, do you copy?


502
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.663
- Yeah.
- We've got a different vehicle...


503
00:50:43.822 --> 00:50:46.575
that took off when they saw us.
I saw somebody duck down.


504
00:50:46.784 --> 00:50:49.412
- Got a description or plates?
- I got the whole enchilada.


505
00:50:49.578 --> 00:50:53.799
It's a '77 orange Camaro. License
number Mary, William, 85-10.


506
00:50:54.708 --> 00:50:56.426
That's my daughter's car.

507
00:50:58.212 --> 00:51:00.590
Uh, how do you want
us to proceed, sir?


508
00:51:00.756 --> 00:51:02.383
With extreme care, asshole.

509
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:06.179
If that kid is with her, there's every
good chance he'll do something crazy.


510
00:51:09.765 --> 00:51:11.312
Please, don't do anything crazy.

511
00:51:18.649 --> 00:51:21.323
I know what I'm doing. I got
you your supplies, didn't I?


512
00:51:28.575 --> 00:51:31.203
If I can just get us to
Cunningham Road, I can lose them.


513
00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.293
Stay down.

514
00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.133
Whatever you say.

515
00:51:43.799 --> 00:51:45.426
That's what I want.

516
00:51:48.762 --> 00:51:51.164
This is gonna be a
hairy turn. Hang on.


517
00:52:03.652 --> 00:52:06.576
Megan, step out of the car.

518
00:52:07.447 --> 00:52:09.290
End of the line.

519
00:52:11.243 --> 00:52:12.995
Oh, shit.

520
00:52:49.656 --> 00:52:52.284
Paula, I can't sleep. I'm scared.

521
00:52:52.451 --> 00:52:54.545
I saw someone at my window.

522
00:52:54.703 --> 00:52:58.503
- Where did you get this?
- I found it outside.


523
00:52:58.665 --> 00:53:03.546
Ah, you know what? Sissy and
Cort are playing jokes.


524
00:53:03.712 --> 00:53:05.555
You know, trying to
scare each other.


525
00:53:05.756 --> 00:53:07.133
- Why?
- Well...


526
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:09.719
because grownups think
it's funny to be scared.


527
00:53:09.885 --> 00:53:12.934
- What?
- Heh, never mind.


528
00:53:13.805 --> 00:53:17.150
I can't believe it's that
late. No one called.


529
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:20.062
- I better...
- Who you calling?


530
00:53:21.438 --> 00:53:24.237
Why don't we go and find
Sissy and Cort first.


531
00:53:24.399 --> 00:53:26.868
Then you can go to bed.

532
00:53:27.027 --> 00:53:30.907
- Wait. What if they try to scare us?
- Well, we'll scare them right back.


533
00:53:31.073 --> 00:53:32.916
- Okay, heh.
- Okay, heh.


534
00:53:36.578 --> 00:53:39.627
Let's go. Let's find them.

535
00:53:53.136 --> 00:53:54.549
I said, shut up!

536
00:53:54.575 --> 00:53:56.765
All he's asking you to
do is just check it out.


537
00:53:56.807 --> 00:53:59.769
- You've got me where you want me.
- If I had you where I wanted you...


538
00:53:59.795 --> 00:54:02.309
they'd be pumping your
ass full of formaldehyde.


539
00:54:02.437 --> 00:54:05.317
Why don't you at least call the camp,
make sure everything's all right.


540
00:54:05.391 --> 00:54:08.056
We have, trying to track you down.
The phone there's disconnected.


541
00:54:08.082 --> 00:54:10.552
- Doesn't that tell you something?
- Yeah, they should've paid their bill.


542
00:54:10.578 --> 00:54:11.647
Sheriff.

543
00:54:13.115 --> 00:54:15.789
You just sit tight, Jason.
As soon as the authorities...


544
00:54:15.951 --> 00:54:19.205
- from Carpenter get here...
- Sheriff! You better take this.


545
00:54:20.497 --> 00:54:22.295
Sheriff Garris.

546
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.633
What time?

547
00:54:28.839 --> 00:54:30.261
I'll be right there.

548
00:54:34.886 --> 00:54:37.480
- What's happened?
- Rick.


549
00:54:38.807 --> 00:54:41.902
Keep an eye on this wacko.
I'll be back as soon as I can.


550
00:54:42.102 --> 00:54:43.399
What's going on?

551
00:54:43.603 --> 00:54:45.981
Make sure my daughter
stays put. She's grounded.


552
00:54:46.189 --> 00:54:46.783
Tell me!

553
00:54:46.809 --> 00:54:49.184
They just found your
friend Cort and some girl.


554
00:54:49.317 --> 00:54:53.163
Her head was crushed in and Cort, he
had a knife rammed through his skull.


555
00:54:53.572 --> 00:54:54.869
No.

556
00:54:55.699 --> 00:54:58.999
Tommy Jarvis is a
psychopathic killer.


557
00:55:00.328 --> 00:55:02.831
- He wants you to believe that...
- It was Jason.


558
00:55:02.998 --> 00:55:04.375
Sheriff, when did it happen?

559
00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:09.384
For God's sake, Meggie,
stay away from him, please.


560
00:55:10.714 --> 00:55:12.512
- What time did this happen?
- What difference does that make?


561
00:55:12.674 --> 00:55:15.518
- What time?
- Eight-thirty, 9:00. Why?


562
00:55:16.219 --> 00:55:19.268
Tommy was with me
all that time, Dad.


563
00:55:27.272 --> 00:55:28.740
Rick...

564
00:55:29.524 --> 00:55:31.868
I'll call you from there.
Lock him up.


565
00:55:37.574 --> 00:55:40.578
Okay, flash, into the cage.

566
00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:56.560
I'm sure Sissy and Cort are
back in their cabins by now.


567
00:55:56.718 --> 00:55:59.437
So you just go back to
sleep and don't worry.


568
00:55:59.638 --> 00:56:02.061
But what if I get scared again?

569
00:56:02.224 --> 00:56:03.567
Shh!

570
00:56:03.725 --> 00:56:06.899
You know what I used to do when
I was a little girl and I got scared?


571
00:56:07.062 --> 00:56:10.282
I would close my eyes and
say a little prayer.


572
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:15.412
And you know what? Pretty soon,
everything scary went away.


573
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:19.245
It worked for me. I bet it'll
work for you too, heh.


574
00:56:19.407 --> 00:56:22.411
- Good night.
- Good night.


575
00:56:23.286 --> 00:56:25.630
See you in the morning.

576
00:57:15.297 --> 00:57:16.799
Cort?

577
00:57:51.583 --> 00:57:53.085
Sissy?

578
00:59:07.575 --> 00:59:09.248
No!

579
00:59:54.664 --> 00:59:57.964
- No.
- Yes.


580
01:00:15.477 --> 01:00:17.150
So, what are you drawing?

581
01:00:17.354 --> 01:00:18.697
So, what's it to you?

582
01:00:18.855 --> 01:00:20.653
Pipe down, Jarvis!

583
01:00:20.815 --> 01:00:24.160
I was just curious as to
what she's drawing, is all.


584
01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.742
There, you happy?

585
01:00:28.156 --> 01:00:29.999
- No.
- Why?


586
01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.077
Because it stinks.

587
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:41.924
- Okay, give it back.
- Come and get it.


588
01:00:42.504 --> 01:00:45.053
I'll get it for you, babe.

589
01:00:46.591 --> 01:00:47.888
Come and get it.

590
01:00:48.385 --> 01:00:50.137
Give it back, punk!

591
01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:07.704
Hey!

592
01:01:07.862 --> 01:01:11.366
Hey, hey! Get your
hands off her, animal.


593
01:01:11.533 --> 01:01:14.753
You little turd! I ought
to punch you silly.


594
01:01:15.954 --> 01:01:17.706
Let him out of there, Rick.

595
01:01:18.665 --> 01:01:19.917
Megan.

596
01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.877
Don't clown around.

597
01:01:22.043 --> 01:01:23.966
I'm not the one with
the funny red nose.


598
01:01:24.546 --> 01:01:27.675
Now, open the cell and let him out.

599
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:29.893
Meggie.

600
01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:32.053
I'm not kidding.

601
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.063
You better do as she says...

602
01:01:34.222 --> 01:01:37.692
because wherever the red
dot goes, you bang.


603
01:01:45.942 --> 01:01:48.195
You son of a bitch!

604
01:02:00.582 --> 01:02:03.256
You're really screwing
up here, missy.


605
01:02:04.752 --> 01:02:07.221
Don't do this, Megan!

606
01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.132
Megan!

607
01:02:11.259 --> 01:02:13.728
- I thought he took your key.
- He did.


608
01:02:14.888 --> 01:02:17.141
- But I've got my hide-a-key.
- Not this time.


609
01:02:17.307 --> 01:02:19.901
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I appreciate you getting me out...


610
01:02:20.059 --> 01:02:22.187
but I have to finish
what I started here.


611
01:02:30.987 --> 01:02:35.117
Come on, hot lips, let's go.
You drive, I'll navigate.


612
01:02:52.884 --> 01:02:57.014
Let me know when we're about to blast
into hyperspace. I'll fasten my seatbelt.


613
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.774
I got a bad feeling
we're already too late.


614
01:03:04.437 --> 01:03:06.235
Are you sure this is gonna work?

615
01:03:06.397 --> 01:03:08.775
Why didn't we just bring
the gun and blow him away?


616
01:03:08.942 --> 01:03:12.867
The only way now to stop Jason is to
return him to his original resting place.


617
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:15.202
Where he drowned in 1957.

618
01:03:15.365 --> 01:03:18.995
- Lake Forest Green.
- Crystal Lake.


619
01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.004
Where this nightmare began.

620
01:04:29.314 --> 01:04:32.193
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.


621
01:04:32.358 --> 01:04:36.579
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.


622
01:04:36.738 --> 01:04:39.098
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.


623
01:04:40.116 --> 01:04:43.746
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.


624
01:04:52.879 --> 01:04:56.258
- So, what's the story here?
- Why don't you boys nose around.


625
01:04:56.424 --> 01:04:59.394
I gotta break the news to Megan's
friends about what's happened.


626
01:04:59.552 --> 01:05:01.395
- Holler if you see anything.
- Like what?


627
01:05:01.554 --> 01:05:05.604
Anything that don't belong.
And don't wake the kids.


628
01:05:08.436 --> 01:05:10.188
Come on, handsome.

629
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:16.118
Girls?

630
01:05:18.279 --> 01:05:20.077
It's Sheriff Garris.

631
01:06:12.959 --> 01:06:14.552
Hey!

632
01:06:43.197 --> 01:06:44.995
Oh, my God.

633
01:07:01.215 --> 01:07:03.309
All right, come on out of there.

634
01:07:12.059 --> 01:07:14.437
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

635
01:07:17.148 --> 01:07:18.821
Come on out of there.

636
01:07:40.505 --> 01:07:43.600
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing running around out here?


637
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:47.516
- Now, you go on back to bed.
- No! No, there's a scary man!


638
01:07:47.678 --> 01:07:49.680
Oh, what scary man?

639
01:08:14.121 --> 01:08:17.091
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Everything's all right.


640
01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:19.719
Everything's okay,
honey. It's okay.


641
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.762
Come on, boys, let's go.

642
01:08:37.895 --> 01:08:40.114
Come on, kids. Come on.

643
01:08:40.982 --> 01:08:43.155
Now, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.


644
01:08:43.317 --> 01:08:45.820
I want you to all lie down
on the floor under the beds.


645
01:08:45.987 --> 01:08:50.709
Do not get up until I come back. Do you
understand? Now, move, hurry. Come on.


646
01:08:52.201 --> 01:08:53.578
Come on.

647
01:10:15.117 --> 01:10:16.664
Fuck!

648
01:10:48.943 --> 01:10:51.037
- See, they did show up.
- Yeah.


649
01:10:52.405 --> 01:10:53.827
We'll have to take...

650
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.038
Megan, wait!

651
01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:08.463
Oh, God. Dad! Daddy!

652
01:11:23.352 --> 01:11:26.401
It's okay. It's me, Megan.
Don't be afraid. It's okay.


653
01:11:26.564 --> 01:11:29.784
Shh, everything's gonna be
all right. Don't be afraid.


654
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:33.283
- Is everyone okay?
- They're fine. They're fine.


655
01:11:33.446 --> 01:11:36.450
It's okay. Everything's
gonna be just fine, okay?


656
01:12:12.693 --> 01:12:16.664
I'm gonna go find my daddy, the sheriff,
and then we can all go home, okay?


657
01:12:17.114 --> 01:12:19.708
Now, uh, go back and lie down
where you were before...


658
01:12:19.867 --> 01:12:22.086
and stay there. Go ahead.

659
01:12:22.244 --> 01:12:24.713
And we'll come back and get you.

660
01:12:24.872 --> 01:12:26.920
I promise. Go lie down. Stay there.

661
01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:28.585
What do you think?

662
01:12:28.751 --> 01:12:31.174
I think we're dead meat.

663
01:12:35.633 --> 01:12:37.681
Daddy!

664
01:12:40.179 --> 01:12:42.273
Dad, answer me!

665
01:12:42.473 --> 01:12:43.895
Dad, where are you?

666
01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:47.695
Megan! Use your dad's
radio! Call for help!


667
01:12:47.895 --> 01:12:49.112
And an ambulance!

668
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:59.748
Oh, God.

669
01:13:01.242 --> 01:13:03.040
Stop it!

670
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:07.498
Daddy, where are you?

671
01:13:09.834 --> 01:13:12.929
Daddy, please come to help us!

672
01:13:13.504 --> 01:13:15.097
Daddy!

673
01:13:18.759 --> 01:13:20.932
Real dead meat.

674
01:13:21.095 --> 01:13:24.690
So, what were you gonna
be when you grew up?


675
01:13:25.975 --> 01:13:28.194
Daddy, where are you?

676
01:13:29.979 --> 01:13:33.279
Daddy! Come help us, please!

677
01:13:39.155 --> 01:13:40.407
No, not her!

678
01:13:41.323 --> 01:13:43.325
No!

679
01:14:06.265 --> 01:14:07.562
Dad!

680
01:14:07.725 --> 01:14:09.853
Dad, answer me!

681
01:14:14.773 --> 01:14:15.865
Ouch.

682
01:14:16.025 --> 01:14:19.370
You've gotta help me find my dad.
We need him to help us.


683
01:14:19.528 --> 01:14:20.871
Hand me the padlock.

684
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:22.498
Aren't you listening to me?

685
01:14:22.656 --> 01:14:25.375
Yes, and I said,
hand me the padlock!


686
01:14:26.619 --> 01:14:29.714
- Here! You're gonna be sorry.
- I hope not.


687
01:14:48.224 --> 01:14:49.601
Megan.

688
01:14:50.559 --> 01:14:53.688
Megan, get back to the
cabin with the kids.


689
01:14:53.854 --> 01:14:55.231
Megan, please!

690
01:14:55.439 --> 01:14:58.784
- Wait a minute. You can't do this.
- Get back in there before it's too late.


691
01:15:07.993 --> 01:15:09.461
Megan, no!

692
01:15:09.995 --> 01:15:11.668
Megan!

693
01:15:12.081 --> 01:15:15.255
Megan! Megan, no!

694
01:15:15.501 --> 01:15:17.253
Jason!

695
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.512
Jason!

696
01:15:26.679 --> 01:15:28.807
Jason, come on!

697
01:15:28.973 --> 01:15:32.102
Come and get me! It's
me you want, remember?


698
01:15:43.195 --> 01:15:46.039
That's it. Come on,
maggot-head. Come on!


699
01:15:46.198 --> 01:15:48.951
Come on, maggot-head.
That's it, come on!


700
01:16:00.504 --> 01:16:01.756
Tommy!

701
01:16:02.631 --> 01:16:03.928
Get out of there!

702
01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:05.968
Hurry!

703
01:16:06.427 --> 01:16:08.555
Hey, asshole!

704
01:16:08.721 --> 01:16:11.440
It's me you want,
remember? Come on!


705
01:16:11.598 --> 01:16:13.066
Come on, chickenshit.

706
01:16:13.225 --> 01:16:16.775
Come on, I'm standing here
waiting. Come on, you pussy!


707
01:19:00.476 --> 01:19:01.693
No!

708
01:19:54.613 --> 01:19:56.581
Is he killed?

709
01:19:59.701 --> 01:20:01.499
Stay here.

710
01:22:31.353 --> 01:22:33.481
All right! Yeah!

711
01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:45.242
It's over.

712
01:22:45.826 --> 01:22:47.999
It's finally over.

713
01:22:48.829 --> 01:22:51.082
Jason's home.

714
01:23:46.656 --> 01:23:49.032
<i>You're with your baby</i>

715
01:23:49.033 --> 01:23:53.162
<i>And you're parked alone
on a summer night</i>


716
01:23:53.163 --> 01:23:57.791
<i>You're deep in love but
you're deeper in the woods</i>


717
01:23:57.792 --> 01:24:00.620
<i>You think you're doing all right</i>

718
01:24:03.131 --> 01:24:05.174
<i>Did you hear that voice?</i>

719
01:24:05.175 --> 01:24:09.386
<i>Did you see that face
or was it just a dream?</i>


720
01:24:09.387 --> 01:24:14.183
<i>This can't be real,
that only happens, babe,</i>


721
01:24:14.184 --> 01:24:16.469
<i>On the movie screen</i>

722
01:24:18.396 --> 01:24:20.772
<i>Oh, but he's back</i>

723
01:24:20.773 --> 01:24:24.818
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

724
01:24:24.819 --> 01:24:27.112
<i>And he's out of control</i>

725
01:24:27.113 --> 01:24:29.072
<i>He's back</i>

726
01:24:29.073 --> 01:24:32.527
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

727
01:24:33.328 --> 01:24:38.866
<i>And he crawled out of his hole</i>

728
01:24:40.835 --> 01:24:45.172
<i>You're swimming with your
girl out on Lover's Lake</i>


729
01:24:45.173 --> 01:24:47.508
<i>And the wind blows cold</i>

730
01:24:47.509 --> 01:24:51.254
<i>It chills your bones but
you're still on the make</i>


731
01:24:52.138 --> 01:24:54.465
<i>That's a bad mistake</i>

732
01:24:56.476 --> 01:24:59.102
<i>Ah, but the moon was full</i>

733
01:24:59.103 --> 01:25:03.106
<i>And you had a chance
to be all alone</i>


734
01:25:03.107 --> 01:25:05.150
<i>But you're not alone</i>

735
01:25:05.151 --> 01:25:07.645
<i>This is your last dance</i>

736
01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:11.232
<i>And your last romance</i>

737
01:25:12.534 --> 01:25:14.910
<i>Yeah, cos he's back</i>

738
01:25:14.911 --> 01:25:19.122
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

739
01:25:19.123 --> 01:25:21.375
<i>And he's out of control</i>

740
01:25:21.376 --> 01:25:23.210
<i>He's back</i>

741
01:25:23.211 --> 01:25:26.664
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

742
01:25:27.215 --> 01:25:32.795
<i>And he crawled out of his hole</i>

743
01:25:50.613 --> 01:25:53.282
<i>Oh, if you see him coming</i>

744
01:25:53.283 --> 01:25:55.659
<i>Get away if you can</i>

745
01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:59.413
<i>Just keep on running,
run as fast as you can</i>


746
01:25:59.414 --> 01:26:04.911
<i>He's a dangerous, dangerous man</i>

747
01:26:05.336 --> 01:26:07.421
<i>And he's out tonight</i>

748
01:26:07.422 --> 01:26:09.339
<i>And he's watching you</i>

749
01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.667
<i>And he knows your house</i>

750
01:26:14.179 --> 01:26:16.839
<i>No, don't turn out the lights</i>

751
01:26:18.683 --> 01:26:21.226
<i>Yeah, cos he's back</i>

752
01:26:21.227 --> 01:26:25.063
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

753
01:26:25.064 --> 01:26:27.399
<i>And he's out of control</i>

754
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.401
<i>He's back</i>

755
01:26:29.402 --> 01:26:33.113
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

756
01:26:33.114 --> 01:26:35.449
<i>And he's after your soul</i>

757
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:37.201
