NEW YORK

3
00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:04.620
<i>I know that it's a lot of money.</i>

4
00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:07.372
Please believe me,

5
00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:10.042
I'll pay back every single dime.

6
00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:13.754
Please.

7
00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:15.422
I…

8
00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:17.674
I really need it.

9
00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:19.426
Please. I'm begging you.

10
00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:26.683
What!

11
00:01:27.893 --> 00:01:30.145
So you'll let Rachel go blind?

12
00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:03.762
Am I going to be blind?

13
00:02:12.312 --> 00:02:13.355
No, honey.

14
00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:16.400
I'll never let that happen.

15
00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:18.777
You'll have a surgery.

16
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.905
And you'll be able to see like before.

17
00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:23.365
Don't worry.

18
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:55.332
Hi, Ruja. It's me, Wichai.

19
00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:57.542
Your dad's friend.

20
00:03:58.126 --> 00:03:59.211
Remember me?

21
00:04:01.004 --> 00:04:03.340
There's something important
I need to tell you.


22
00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:07.969
I think you should come back to Thailand.

23
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:12.307
How did you find me?

24
00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:34.306
Don't…

25
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.517
Don't go back!

26
00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:48.945
Ruja.

27
00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:52.449
We're here.

28
00:05:52.907 --> 00:05:54.075
Let's get inside.

29
00:05:57.871 --> 00:06:02.250
CHIANG MAI

30
00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:36.368
Grandma's house is so big.

31
00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:18.243
What's this room, mommy?

32
00:07:18.868 --> 00:07:20.036
Dining room, honey.

33
00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:24.828
Let's go.

34
00:09:28.498 --> 00:09:32.001
Mommy, are we moving here?

35
00:09:34.754 --> 00:09:35.713
No.

36
00:09:37.257 --> 00:09:39.717
We're here just for a few days.

37
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.560
Hi, Da.

38
00:09:49.102 --> 00:09:51.688
Welcome home, ma'am.

39
00:09:57.527 --> 00:10:00.446
This is Rachel, my daughter.

40
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.739
Ruja.

41
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.492
Come to the studio with me.

42
00:10:05.869 --> 00:10:07.787
Da can look after Rachel.

43
00:10:09.372 --> 00:10:10.665
Now?

44
00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:12.959
Yes. I'll have to leave soon.

45
00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:14.752
It won't take long.

46
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.930
Can you stay with Da? 
I'll be right back.

47
00:10:26.014 --> 00:10:28.391
But I want to come with you.

48
00:10:29.392 --> 00:10:32.145
Kids are not allowed
in the studio, Rachel.


49
00:10:32.228 --> 00:10:34.856
Stay here with me.

50
00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:38.943
I'll show you your bedroom upstairs.
Want to see it?


51
00:10:44.407 --> 00:10:45.450
Come on.

52
00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:46.993
Wait.

53
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.205
Rachel has eye problems.

54
00:10:50.914 --> 00:10:52.457
Please be very careful.

55
00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:54.667
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:10:55.793 --> 00:10:57.003
Let's go.

57
00:11:31.955 --> 00:11:32.830
Ruja.

58
00:11:45.176 --> 00:11:46.219
Come in.

59
00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:23.798
Look here, Portrait of a Beauty,
Number One and Number Two.


60
00:12:37.228 --> 00:12:40.690
Your father painted them
over 20 years ago.


61
00:12:41.691 --> 00:12:45.737
Painting Number One
was sold to one of his fans for…


62
00:12:46.988 --> 00:12:48.322
several million.

63
00:12:50.158 --> 00:12:52.827
But it was returned to this studio…

64
00:12:57.248 --> 00:12:58.458
because…

65
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.092
<i>the owner killed all his family members</i>
<i>and then killed himself.</i>


66
00:13:08.926 --> 00:13:10.970
<i>He left a note under the painting.</i>

67
00:13:11.429 --> 00:13:12.680
<i>It said…</i>

68
00:13:13.222 --> 00:13:16.934
<i>''I'm returning you to your creator.''</i>

69
00:13:19.103 --> 00:13:22.023
So, we got it back for free.

70
00:13:25.359 --> 00:13:28.488
As for Number Two,
Pakorn kept it in good condition.


71
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:30.073
Said it wasn't for sale.

72
00:13:30.656 --> 00:13:31.783
But now,

73
00:13:32.784 --> 00:13:36.412
a millionaire is willing to pay a fortune

74
00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:38.206
to buy both of them.

75
00:13:38.706 --> 00:13:40.875
I need your permission first.

76
00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.335
When will we get the money?

77
00:13:49.717 --> 00:13:54.680
Are you not even going to ask
how your father died?


78
00:14:02.855 --> 00:14:04.982
Yummy, Rachel?

79
00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:06.484
Yummy.

80
00:14:08.277 --> 00:14:11.447
Let me ask you something.

81
00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:14.617
How's your grandma Vipa doing?

82
00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:17.286
Grandma died, from cancer.

83
00:14:19.747 --> 00:14:20.873
Did she?

84
00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:24.752
She didn't hang herself?

85
00:14:26.421 --> 00:14:27.964
Pakorn, your father…

86
00:14:30.258 --> 00:14:32.718
hung himself here.

87
00:14:34.887 --> 00:14:36.431
From that beam.

88
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.774
What is "hang herself?"

89
00:14:49.944 --> 00:14:52.363
Never mind. Forget it.

90
00:14:54.532 --> 00:14:56.576
Forgive him, Ruja.

91
00:14:57.326 --> 00:15:01.247
Think of these expensive paintings

92
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.416
as his redemption.

93
00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:06.002
Are we done?

94
00:15:07.086 --> 00:15:08.838
I want to get out of here.

95
00:15:35.615 --> 00:15:37.241
Rachel, where're you going?

96
00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:38.784
I want to see mommy.

97
00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:45.166
Where did you get that?

98
00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:49.462
You gave it to me just now.

99
00:15:56.677 --> 00:15:58.429
Let me have it back.

100
00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:01.307
I'll wash it for you first.

101
00:16:03.768 --> 00:16:06.896
You wait for your mommy here.
She'll be back soon.


102
00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:08.189
<i>One more thing.</i>

103
00:16:08.856 --> 00:16:10.942
The paintings have some cracks.

104
00:16:11.859 --> 00:16:15.905
I want them fixed before we sell them.

105
00:16:17.281 --> 00:16:20.743
My son is an art restorer,
he can take care of it.


106
00:16:20.826 --> 00:16:23.287
If you think it's necessary, do it.

107
00:16:25.831 --> 00:16:26.916
One more thing…

108
00:16:29.377 --> 00:16:31.087
After his funeral,

109
00:16:32.964 --> 00:16:34.715
I want to sell this house too.

110
00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:37.552
Please see to it for me.

111
00:17:34.692 --> 00:17:35.735
Mommy?

112
00:18:08.017 --> 00:18:09.018
Rachel!

113
00:18:12.229 --> 00:18:13.731
What are you doing?

114
00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:41.610
Please don't hold it against me!

115
00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:19.023
Mommy…

116
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.362
Grandpa's paintings. 
Why can't I see them?

117
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.157
They're scary.

118
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.784
How scary?

119
00:20:30.993 --> 00:20:35.748
So scary that you'll have nightmares.

120
00:20:36.373 --> 00:20:38.417
You don't like nightmares, do you?

121
00:20:41.837 --> 00:20:43.964
Aren't you scared, mommy?

122
00:20:52.973 --> 00:20:56.685
Why does dad paint you like that?

123
00:20:57.394 --> 00:20:59.855
It's just an act.

124
00:21:00.773 --> 00:21:02.566
Like in a play.

125
00:21:03.442 --> 00:21:06.403
It helped dad create nice paintings.

126
00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:11.158
But you cried.

127
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:16.956
It's nothing, Ruja.

128
00:21:18.874 --> 00:21:22.628
But you must not go
into dad's studio again.


129
00:21:23.045 --> 00:21:25.381
He needs to focus on his work.

130
00:21:26.006 --> 00:21:28.008
Promise me, dear.

131
00:22:02.626 --> 00:22:05.129
I miss your grandma, honey.

132
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:22.062
Don't cry, mommy.

133
00:22:24.815 --> 00:22:26.275
Don't cry.

134
00:22:55.804 --> 00:22:56.764
Rachel.

135
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.937
Rachel.

136
00:23:06.106 --> 00:23:07.066
Mommy.

137
00:23:26.168 --> 00:23:27.211
Mommy.

138
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.800
Mommy!

139
00:23:33.634 --> 00:23:34.593
Rachel!

140
00:24:17.136 --> 00:24:18.011
Rachel.

141
00:24:22.057 --> 00:24:22.933
Rachel.

142
00:24:26.812 --> 00:24:28.105
Rachel.

143
00:24:31.608 --> 00:24:32.609
Rachel.

144
00:24:38.449 --> 00:24:39.408
Rachel.

145
00:24:44.705 --> 00:24:45.664
Rachel.

146
00:24:49.585 --> 00:24:50.544
Rachel!

147
00:24:50.627 --> 00:24:51.628
Rachel!

148
00:24:56.133 --> 00:24:57.384
What's going on?

149
00:24:57.468 --> 00:24:58.886
Have you seen Rachel?

150
00:24:58.969 --> 00:24:59.970
Rachel.

151
00:25:00.053 --> 00:25:01.013
Rachel.

152
00:25:02.097 --> 00:25:03.140
Rachel!

153
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.725
Rachel!

154
00:25:05.142 --> 00:25:06.101
Rachel!

155
00:25:06.477 --> 00:25:07.728
Rachel.

156
00:25:08.187 --> 00:25:09.396
Rachel.

157
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.439
Da.

158
00:25:11.815 --> 00:25:13.776
Let's split up.

159
00:25:13.859 --> 00:25:16.320
I'll look in the forest.

160
00:25:17.654 --> 00:25:18.489
Rachel!

161
00:25:18.781 --> 00:25:19.782
Rachel!

162
00:25:31.376 --> 00:25:32.336
Rachel!

163
00:25:35.422 --> 00:25:36.548
Rachel!

164
00:25:37.925 --> 00:25:39.009
Rachel!

165
00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:46.934
Rachel!

166
00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:59.446
Rachel!

167
00:26:02.199 --> 00:26:03.951
Are you in there?

168
00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:12.543
Rachel!

169
00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:20.509
Rachel!

170
00:26:30.185 --> 00:26:31.186
Rachel!

171
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.647
I'm not playing with you!

172
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.985
Come out now!

173
00:28:12.913 --> 00:28:13.789
Rachel!

174
00:28:17.417 --> 00:28:18.335
Rachel!

175
00:28:31.974 --> 00:28:33.225
Rachel!

176
00:28:50.617 --> 00:28:53.203
Where were you? 
You scared me to death.

177
00:28:53.287 --> 00:28:56.873
I took a walk and I met him.

178
00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:59.042
Are you Ruja?

179
00:28:59.126 --> 00:29:00.377
My name's Tim.

180
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.297
I'm here to fix the paintings,
my dad must have told you.


181
00:29:07.843 --> 00:29:09.803
Where did you go for a walk?

182
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.434
Tell me where.

183
00:29:16.268 --> 00:29:17.853
By the stream back there.

184
00:29:20.939 --> 00:29:23.817
It's dangerous.

185
00:29:24.651 --> 00:29:26.570
Don't do it again.

186
00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:29.531
What would I do
if something happened to you?


187
00:29:29.614 --> 00:29:31.158
I wasn't alone.

188
00:29:31.742 --> 00:29:34.870
I went with the
woman with a red scarf.

189
00:29:34.953 --> 00:29:35.954
Stop lying.

190
00:29:36.621 --> 00:29:37.998
I'm not lying.

191
00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:39.041
Rachel.

192
00:29:47.674 --> 00:29:49.051
I'm sorry.

193
00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:53.555
Please don't do it again.

194
00:29:56.892 --> 00:29:58.769
I'm sorry, honey.

195
00:30:18.747 --> 00:30:19.706
Here.

196
00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:20.665
Thank you.

197
00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:26.546
Da,

198
00:30:27.297 --> 00:30:29.466
what happened to your ankle?

199
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:33.553
Just a sprain. 
Nothing serious.

200
00:30:41.186 --> 00:30:42.145
Excuse me.

201
00:30:42.854 --> 00:30:45.023
What were you doing in the woods?

202
00:30:45.107 --> 00:30:46.942
I paint landscapes.

203
00:30:47.442 --> 00:30:51.154
My dad said there's a beautiful stream
behind the house.


204
00:30:51.822 --> 00:30:53.115
So I went to look.

205
00:30:53.198 --> 00:30:56.284
And luckily, I bumped into Rachel.

206
00:30:56.368 --> 00:30:58.537
Rachel has eye problems.

207
00:30:59.371 --> 00:31:01.123
It's not safe for her to wander around.

208
00:31:01.665 --> 00:31:02.916
I see.

209
00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:04.626
But thank you anyway.

210
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.504
Look…

211
00:31:09.423 --> 00:31:10.757
I'll show you my sketches.

212
00:31:12.926 --> 00:31:14.761
Even better, I'll draw you.

213
00:31:20.809 --> 00:31:23.145
You don't have to please her.

214
00:31:23.228 --> 00:31:25.480
It's okay. I really want to draw her.

215
00:31:25.814 --> 00:31:26.773
Here we go.

216
00:31:49.379 --> 00:31:50.213
Done.

217
00:31:52.048 --> 00:31:53.216
Want to see it?

218
00:31:58.555 --> 00:31:59.639
It's ugly.

219
00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:04.186
I think it's pretty.

220
00:32:04.853 --> 00:32:06.021
How about this?

221
00:32:07.147 --> 00:32:10.775
Next time I'll draw you
like a princess. Okay?


222
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.111
I'm sorry.

223
00:32:14.112 --> 00:32:16.907
How long will it take
to fix the paintings?


224
00:32:17.699 --> 00:32:20.911
I need to see them
before I can answer that.


225
00:32:20.994 --> 00:32:25.165
But I've heard the damages
are minor. Right?


226
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:33.228
Mommy, when will the rain stop?
I want to play outside.


227
00:35:34.979 --> 00:35:35.855
Rachel.

228
00:35:37.565 --> 00:35:39.067
Listen to mommy.

229
00:35:39.651 --> 00:35:44.614
From now on, when you want to go outside
you have to ask me first.


230
00:35:45.407 --> 00:35:46.658
Understand?

231
00:35:47.325 --> 00:35:49.786
Can I go with Tim?

232
00:35:50.495 --> 00:35:51.621
No, you can't.

233
00:35:52.038 --> 00:35:54.332
But I like him.

234
00:35:56.626 --> 00:36:00.046
I want him to draw my picture.

235
00:36:01.506 --> 00:36:02.340
Ruja.

236
00:36:02.716 --> 00:36:03.591
Tim.

237
00:36:03.925 --> 00:36:05.218
Hi, Rachel.

238
00:36:06.302 --> 00:36:07.345
How's it going?

239
00:36:09.639 --> 00:36:11.725
Let me talk to
your mommy for a second.

240
00:36:13.017 --> 00:36:15.895
You should come see
something in the studio.


241
00:36:17.856 --> 00:36:19.441
Can I come too?

242
00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:24.821
Whatever it is,
you don't need my permission.


243
00:36:24.904 --> 00:36:26.906
It's not about the restoration.

244
00:36:27.741 --> 00:36:29.909
Believe me, you have to see it.

245
00:36:40.879 --> 00:36:41.755
This.

246
00:36:45.675 --> 00:36:49.512
I had no idea it was this bad.

247
00:36:50.555 --> 00:36:51.973
Look at these cracks.

248
00:37:00.607 --> 00:37:01.900
What's the matter?

249
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.780
Nothing.

250
00:37:17.457 --> 00:37:18.875
What are you doing?

251
00:37:21.044 --> 00:37:22.629
You'll ruin it even more.

252
00:37:22.712 --> 00:37:25.465
I have to fix it anyway, right?

253
00:37:50.782 --> 00:37:52.450
Put it back right now.

254
00:37:55.578 --> 00:37:58.456
Don't you want to see what's underneath?

255
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:59.791
No.

256
00:38:01.835 --> 00:38:03.628
It could be a big discovery,

257
00:38:03.711 --> 00:38:07.423
may raise the value
of your father's paintings artistically--


258
00:38:07.507 --> 00:38:10.468
I don't care. Okay? Put it back.

259
00:38:14.347 --> 00:38:15.682
You should care.

260
00:38:16.558 --> 00:38:18.309
If you want to sell it.

261
00:38:23.898 --> 00:38:25.024
Or…

262
00:38:26.317 --> 00:38:28.736
Do you think it's haunted?

263
00:38:33.241 --> 00:38:34.409
Nonsense.

264
00:38:35.618 --> 00:38:36.703
I'm kidding.

265
00:38:40.915 --> 00:38:42.166
But I don't get it.

266
00:38:43.668 --> 00:38:47.130
People always think of ghosts
when they see unexpected things.


267
00:38:48.089 --> 00:38:49.799
But everything can be explained.

268
00:38:51.593 --> 00:38:52.510
Listen…

269
00:38:53.303 --> 00:38:54.929
You know the Mona Lisa?

270
00:38:58.391 --> 00:38:59.559
You do.

271
00:39:00.351 --> 00:39:04.939
They say when you
lock your eyes with hers

272
00:39:05.356 --> 00:39:09.944
her gaze will follow you
no matter where you walk in the room.


273
00:39:10.028 --> 00:39:12.196
But it has nothing to do with ghosts.

274
00:39:12.614 --> 00:39:14.449
The same with this painting.

275
00:39:15.366 --> 00:39:16.451
Let's test it.

276
00:39:35.178 --> 00:39:37.889
See for yourself
so you'll stop being afraid.


277
00:39:43.269 --> 00:39:44.270
Let's try.

278
00:39:44.979 --> 00:39:46.648
Look her in the eyes.

279
00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:50.818
And walk this way.

280
00:40:15.718 --> 00:40:17.470
Is she following you?

281
00:40:19.847 --> 00:40:21.599
See? I told you.

282
00:40:41.744 --> 00:40:42.745
What's wrong?

283
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.584
Just fix the damn thing.

284
00:41:49.103 --> 00:41:51.230
Is this your dress, mommy?

285
00:41:52.482 --> 00:41:54.067
Can I try it on?

286
00:41:57.153 --> 00:41:58.029
Da!

287
00:41:58.112 --> 00:42:00.531
You shouldn't let her play
with dirty clothes!


288
00:42:00.615 --> 00:42:02.867
Burn them all. Come here.

289
00:43:10.143 --> 00:43:11.144
Rachel.

290
00:43:11.978 --> 00:43:13.187
Are you okay?

291
00:43:24.031 --> 00:43:26.492
There's someone under the bed.

292
00:43:33.082 --> 00:43:35.459
It's just you and me here.

293
00:43:45.303 --> 00:43:46.137
Fine.

294
00:43:48.764 --> 00:43:50.016
I'll look.

295
00:45:09.929 --> 00:45:11.931
Mommy, I can't see.

296
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:23.275
Rachel!

297
00:45:26.278 --> 00:45:27.196
Rachel!

298
00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.157
Rachel.

299
00:45:34.745 --> 00:45:35.579
Rachel.

300
00:45:36.205 --> 00:45:37.039
Rachel.

301
00:45:49.927 --> 00:45:52.138
Ruja! What's the matter?

302
00:45:52.221 --> 00:45:53.431
Get me out of here.

303
00:45:53.514 --> 00:45:56.267
-What's wrong?
-Just get me out of here!


304
00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:57.643
It's pouring outside.

305
00:45:57.727 --> 00:45:59.937
But I need to get out of here!

306
00:46:00.021 --> 00:46:01.605
You have to help me!

307
00:46:01.689 --> 00:46:02.732
Calm down.

308
00:46:03.149 --> 00:46:04.108
Take it easy.

309
00:46:15.286 --> 00:46:16.537
Have some tea.

310
00:46:30.718 --> 00:46:31.594
Rachel.

311
00:46:34.972 --> 00:46:37.600
This anklet has a magical power.

312
00:46:38.476 --> 00:46:39.810
I'm giving it to you.

313
00:46:46.275 --> 00:46:48.319
Let me put it on.

314
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.285
It came from a tribal village
in the hills.


315
00:46:57.203 --> 00:46:59.789
They believe that
if you walk around wearing it,


316
00:46:59.872 --> 00:47:02.708
the jingling sound can chase away demons.

317
00:47:03.334 --> 00:47:04.251
Try it.

318
00:47:22.019 --> 00:47:24.897
Thank you for the anklet.

319
00:47:31.278 --> 00:47:33.114
You can paint, right?

320
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:36.575
How come you chose to be a restorer?

321
00:47:37.368 --> 00:47:40.579
It pays well, so why not?

322
00:47:44.792 --> 00:47:46.877
I wanted to be an artist.

323
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:51.132
Even had an exhibition once.

324
00:47:52.007 --> 00:47:53.759
All my paintings were sold out.

325
00:47:56.554 --> 00:48:00.516
Because my dad hired people
to buy them up.


326
00:48:02.768 --> 00:48:04.603
It made me realize

327
00:48:05.563 --> 00:48:08.274
that I could never
run away from his shadow.


328
00:48:08.941 --> 00:48:11.402
So I decided to work with him instead.

329
00:48:15.698 --> 00:48:17.741
I'm no different.

330
00:48:19.869 --> 00:48:23.164
You're doing it for your daughter.

331
00:48:23.706 --> 00:48:27.459
I'm sure Rachel is so proud of you.

332
00:48:36.719 --> 00:48:38.387
Rachel likes you a lot.

333
00:48:38.804 --> 00:48:40.222
I know.

334
00:48:41.098 --> 00:48:42.433
Because I'm handsome.

335
00:49:09.919 --> 00:49:11.128
Sorry, honey.

336
00:49:14.798 --> 00:49:16.258
We have to go.

337
00:49:44.912 --> 00:49:45.746
Tim.

338
00:49:46.205 --> 00:49:47.039
Ruja.

339
00:49:51.168 --> 00:49:54.964
I was about to come and get you.
You have to see this.


340
00:49:56.006 --> 00:49:59.176
I don't want to go in there.
The rain's stopped, let just go.


341
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.720
Take a look first
and then we can leave.

342
00:50:03.973 --> 00:50:07.518
I don't want Rachel to go in there.

343
00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:14.483
It's okay. I'm here with you.

344
00:50:16.944 --> 00:50:18.112
Just a quick look.

345
00:50:31.417 --> 00:50:32.543
Don't look.

346
00:50:34.503 --> 00:50:36.463
Wait for me here.

347
00:50:37.715 --> 00:50:40.342
Don't look at the paintings.

348
00:50:40.801 --> 00:50:41.677
Promise?

349
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.720
Promise.

350
00:50:42.803 --> 00:50:43.804
Good girl.

351
00:50:56.608 --> 00:50:58.360
Did you rip it off?

352
00:50:59.778 --> 00:51:00.946
I'm sorry.

353
00:51:02.156 --> 00:51:05.200
I really wanted to know what's underneath.

354
00:51:06.785 --> 00:51:09.330
You know what? This man--

355
00:51:09.747 --> 00:51:11.582
Was the one who committed suicide.

356
00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:13.500
How do you know?

357
00:51:13.584 --> 00:51:15.002
You father told me.

358
00:51:20.883 --> 00:51:24.595
I've been wondering
why he did what he did.


359
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.642
If we peel off the whole thing,
we might know the truth.


360
00:51:30.726 --> 00:51:32.686
There is no truth whatsoever!

361
00:51:33.395 --> 00:51:35.606
And it's none of my business.

362
00:51:36.315 --> 00:51:38.901
Get me and my
daughter out of here now!

363
00:53:31.054 --> 00:53:32.055
Rachel!

364
00:53:38.145 --> 00:53:39.188
Rachel!

365
00:53:42.441 --> 00:53:43.442
Rachel!

366
00:53:43.859 --> 00:53:44.860
Rachel!

367
00:53:45.652 --> 00:53:46.612
Rachel!

368
00:53:48.447 --> 00:53:49.448
Rachel!

369
00:53:50.199 --> 00:53:51.617
Where are you?

370
00:53:52.034 --> 00:53:52.868
Rachel!

371
00:54:09.885 --> 00:54:10.886
Ruja.

372
00:54:16.099 --> 00:54:17.392
Mommy.

373
00:54:20.312 --> 00:54:22.481
Wait for me, mommy.

374
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:14.283
Mommy.

375
00:55:58.285 --> 00:55:59.578
Mommy.

376
00:56:22.351 --> 00:56:24.269
You're hurting me.

377
00:56:28.774 --> 00:56:29.775
Da!

378
00:56:32.903 --> 00:56:33.862
Ma'am.

379
00:56:34.196 --> 00:56:35.864
Let her go.

380
00:56:37.532 --> 00:56:39.201
I have no choice.

381
00:56:41.328 --> 00:56:42.871
If I don't do it,

382
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:47.250
she won't leave me in peace.

383
00:56:49.336 --> 00:56:50.837
What are you talking about?

384
00:56:51.963 --> 00:56:53.965
Let her go right now.

385
00:56:54.841 --> 00:56:55.842
No.

386
00:56:56.176 --> 00:56:58.929
No. I can't! I have to do this!

387
00:56:59.596 --> 00:57:01.973
Mommy, help me!

388
00:57:04.393 --> 00:57:06.019
Mommy.

389
00:57:07.729 --> 00:57:11.316
She's a just a kid,
she has nothing to do with this.


390
00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:13.485
In that case…

391
00:57:14.903 --> 00:57:16.697
you jump instead,

392
00:57:17.864 --> 00:57:19.825
and I will let her go.

393
00:57:22.285 --> 00:57:23.912
What are you talking about?

394
00:57:25.247 --> 00:57:28.417
Please don't do this. 
I'm begging you.

395
00:57:29.918 --> 00:57:30.794
No.

396
00:57:31.253 --> 00:57:32.796
No.

397
00:57:33.463 --> 00:57:34.673
I have to do it.

398
00:57:34.881 --> 00:57:35.924
I have to!

399
00:57:42.347 --> 00:57:43.807
Please don't hurt me.

400
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:47.936
I'll do anything for you.

401
00:57:48.395 --> 00:57:49.688
Kill them all.

402
00:57:53.191 --> 00:57:55.068
I have no choice.

403
00:57:56.028 --> 00:57:57.112
Jump!

404
00:57:57.529 --> 00:57:58.739
Jump!

405
00:58:03.326 --> 00:58:04.369
Da…

406
00:58:05.037 --> 00:58:05.871
Da.

407
00:58:06.121 --> 00:58:07.497
Calm down, please.

408
00:58:07.581 --> 00:58:08.623
I'm sorry.

409
00:58:08.915 --> 00:58:10.459
I'm really sorry!

410
00:58:12.044 --> 00:58:14.337
Help me, mommy.

411
00:58:16.048 --> 00:58:16.882
Da!

412
00:58:18.759 --> 00:58:19.885
Rachel!

413
00:58:41.823 --> 00:58:43.533
Are you hurt?

414
00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.852
You wait here. 
I'll be right back.

415
00:59:17.609 --> 00:59:18.610
What are you doing?

416
00:59:18.693 --> 00:59:20.237
I'm going to rip it to pieces!

417
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.363
Are you crazy?

418
00:59:21.446 --> 00:59:23.573
It's all because of these damn paintings!

419
00:59:32.666 --> 00:59:36.253
You think you can save me
by destroying the paintings?


420
00:59:38.213 --> 00:59:39.840
Rachel, what's wrong with you?

421
00:59:49.808 --> 00:59:51.476
What did you just say?

422
01:00:01.987 --> 01:00:02.904
Rachel.

423
01:00:02.988 --> 01:00:04.614
I'm not your fucking daughter.

424
01:00:07.826 --> 01:00:11.413
Because of you and your evil family,

425
01:00:13.582 --> 01:00:15.000
I have become like this!

426
01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:17.169
Rachel.

427
01:00:46.114 --> 01:00:47.115
Rachel!

428
01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:48.617
Rachel!

429
01:01:05.759 --> 01:01:06.760
Rachel!

430
01:01:26.363 --> 01:01:27.364
Ruja.

431
01:03:08.256 --> 01:03:09.257
Ruja.

432
01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.636
What happened?

433
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:18.808
Get me and my daughter out of here.

434
01:03:22.479 --> 01:03:23.855
What the hell's going on?

435
01:03:25.482 --> 01:03:27.525
Please, get us out of here!

436
01:04:08.942 --> 01:04:09.859
Boring.

437
01:04:11.444 --> 01:04:13.488
I'll do anything…

438
01:04:15.532 --> 01:04:17.617
to make you love me again.

439
01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:22.997
Love?

440
01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:26.793
How corny.

441
01:04:34.634 --> 01:04:37.137
I can make you happy.

442
01:04:37.595 --> 01:04:39.013
Like before.

443
01:04:57.824 --> 01:05:00.827
Want to make me happy like before?

444
01:05:13.465 --> 01:05:14.424
Rachel.

445
01:05:17.719 --> 01:05:19.929
Don't move. It'll hurt more.

446
01:05:31.232 --> 01:05:32.275
Want some?

447
01:05:34.944 --> 01:05:36.154
Who are you?

448
01:05:39.782 --> 01:05:41.576
Who the fuck are you?

449
01:05:51.586 --> 01:05:53.213
Your mother was sexy.

450
01:05:55.924 --> 01:05:57.509
Where's Rachel?

451
01:06:10.188 --> 01:06:13.733
An artist's party can get pretty wild.

452
01:06:38.758 --> 01:06:41.302
Tell me about these paintings.

453
01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:44.973
Okay.

454
01:06:45.932 --> 01:06:48.476
I'll tell you.

455
01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:52.480
But promise me you won't hurt me.

456
01:06:55.358 --> 01:06:57.068
Okay.

457
01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.699
After that night's party…

458
01:07:04.909 --> 01:07:10.665
Pakorn picked only two close friends
to stay for the real highlight.


459
01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:14.210
<i>Prang, his favorite model,</i>

460
01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:18.214
<i>was a surprise he'd prepared for them.</i>

461
01:07:18.298 --> 01:07:23.011
<i>Pakorn wanted the two guests</i>
<i>to take part in his artistic creation.</i>


462
01:08:06.304 --> 01:08:08.514
He's the first one who died,

463
01:08:11.434 --> 01:08:12.894
along with his entire family.

464
01:08:23.821 --> 01:08:25.990
Your son's lighter is actually cool.

465
01:08:40.046 --> 01:08:41.005
Tim!

466
01:08:42.715 --> 01:08:43.800
Tim!

467
01:08:49.555 --> 01:08:52.058
Don't hurt me.

468
01:08:52.558 --> 01:08:55.937
Tell me what you want!

469
01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:57.897
I'll give you everything.

470
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:01.943
Just let me go.

471
01:09:02.026 --> 01:09:03.736
Apologize to my mother.

472
01:11:01.896 --> 01:11:02.897
Mom.

473
01:11:07.568 --> 01:11:09.612
Mom, look at this.

474
01:12:06.002 --> 01:12:07.003
Ruja.

475
01:12:10.631 --> 01:12:11.883
Listen to me.

476
01:12:13.092 --> 01:12:14.427
Prang…

477
01:12:15.011 --> 01:12:16.637
and her son

478
01:12:18.055 --> 01:12:20.182
are bad people.

479
01:12:21.934 --> 01:12:24.604
They are a ghost-worshipping hill-tribe.

480
01:12:24.687 --> 01:12:26.522
They hurt your dad.

481
01:12:26.606 --> 01:12:28.232
They hurt me.

482
01:12:28.649 --> 01:12:30.902
And they will hurt you.

483
01:12:31.986 --> 01:12:32.945
Ruja.

484
01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.699
Ruja.

485
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:38.868
Ruja.

486
01:12:39.827 --> 01:12:40.661
Ruja!

487
01:12:41.537 --> 01:12:42.538
Listen to me.

488
01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:48.127
We must not let them hurt us.

489
01:12:51.297 --> 01:12:56.636
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


490
01:12:58.638 --> 01:13:00.014
Repeat after me.

491
01:13:02.224 --> 01:13:06.562
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


492
01:13:06.646 --> 01:13:11.317
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


493
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.112
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


494
01:13:42.848 --> 01:13:45.851
You really didn't see it, Ruja?

495
01:15:18.194 --> 01:15:19.070
Mom!

496
01:15:25.743 --> 01:15:28.329
Dad, help mom!

497
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:32.666
Help her!

498
01:15:34.376 --> 01:15:36.587
Dad, help her!

499
01:15:38.047 --> 01:15:40.216
You'll be okay.

500
01:15:43.177 --> 01:15:45.888
Somebody, help my mom.

501
01:15:47.139 --> 01:15:50.142
Please, help my mom.

502
01:16:07.827 --> 01:16:09.662
I still don't get it…

503
01:16:13.082 --> 01:16:15.751
why dad didn't help mom that night.

504
01:16:18.921 --> 01:16:20.297
But I knew

505
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:23.634
there's someone who could.

506
01:16:25.427 --> 01:16:26.971
It's you, Ruja.

507
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:40.276
Help my mom, Ruja!

508
01:16:42.111 --> 01:16:45.656
Help my mom!

509
01:16:51.287 --> 01:16:55.875
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


510
01:16:56.417 --> 01:17:00.838
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


511
01:17:01.463 --> 01:17:05.509
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


512
01:17:19.815 --> 01:17:22.943
I told you to stay away when I'm working.
Is that hard to understand?


513
01:17:23.027 --> 01:17:24.028
Idiot!

514
01:17:28.282 --> 01:17:29.450
Ruja.

515
01:17:30.534 --> 01:17:32.161
Help, please.

516
01:17:36.749 --> 01:17:40.127
Help my mom, Ruja.

517
01:17:40.711 --> 01:17:42.171
You fucking idiot!

518
01:17:43.214 --> 01:17:44.256
Ruja.

519
01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:45.549
What's wrong?

520
01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:46.926
Ruja.

521
01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:50.638
Help my mom, Ruja.

522
01:18:23.212 --> 01:18:25.965
I know you saw everything.

523
01:18:34.682 --> 01:18:36.684
But you and your mother

524
01:18:37.643 --> 01:18:39.395
just ran away.

525
01:18:46.568 --> 01:18:51.198
You know what they
did to us after that?

526
01:19:21.186 --> 01:19:24.273
I've been waiting
to paint your beautiful face.


527
01:19:27.651 --> 01:19:30.529
But you're in pretty bad shape right now.

528
01:19:44.251 --> 01:19:45.252
Rachel!

529
01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:46.754
Rachel!

530
01:19:46.837 --> 01:19:48.422
Rachel!

531
01:19:48.505 --> 01:19:49.381
Rachel!

532
01:19:50.507 --> 01:19:52.551
Help me, mommy.

533
01:19:52.634 --> 01:19:54.094
I'm here, honey.

534
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:00.976
Rachel!

535
01:20:01.518 --> 01:20:03.270
Mommy is right here.

536
01:20:05.064 --> 01:20:06.940
Please don't hurt her.

537
01:20:14.907 --> 01:20:16.075
Don't hurt her.

538
01:20:17.826 --> 01:20:20.371
Hurt me instead!

539
01:20:21.372 --> 01:20:23.374
Do it to me!

540
01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.709
You never knew how it feels

541
01:20:25.793 --> 01:20:29.421
seeing your loved one
being tortured and killed


542
01:20:30.339 --> 01:20:33.467
and that you can't do anything about it.

543
01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:36.011
You will know now.

544
01:20:48.315 --> 01:20:49.733
I'm sorry.

545
01:20:51.527 --> 01:20:53.654
I'm sorry.

546
01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:02.329
I'm really sorry.

547
01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:06.959
Sorry?

548
01:21:12.297 --> 01:21:13.674
You're sorry?

549
01:21:24.768 --> 01:21:26.854
Soon you'll be very sorry.

550
01:21:39.867 --> 01:21:41.201
Don't touch her!

551
01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.245
Let her go now!

552
01:22:06.977 --> 01:22:10.397
Wichai's son is going to erase
the truth under the painting of yours.


553
01:22:11.523 --> 01:22:13.233
I'm doing this for you, Prang.

554
01:22:43.889 --> 01:22:44.723
Mommy.

555
01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:57.444
Mommy.

556
01:23:00.072 --> 01:23:01.114
Mommy.

557
01:23:07.746 --> 01:23:08.580
Mommy.

558
01:23:12.834 --> 01:23:13.752
Mommy!

559
01:23:14.753 --> 01:23:15.837
Mommy!

560
01:23:38.986 --> 01:23:39.987
Mommy.

561
01:24:27.993 --> 01:24:28.952
<i>Ruja.</i>

562
01:24:32.873 --> 01:24:35.167
We must not let them hurt us.

563
01:24:36.668 --> 01:24:42.090
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.


564
01:26:02.546 --> 01:26:04.548
Listen to mommy, Rachel.

565
01:26:09.469 --> 01:26:11.888
We only have each other now.

566
01:26:15.767 --> 01:26:18.145
I'll protect you with my own life.

567
01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.941
No one can hurt you again.

568
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:26.695
I promise.

569
01:27:37.891 --> 01:27:44.147
