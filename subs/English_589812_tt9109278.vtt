have a man as a roommate.

5
00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:22.051
He was so nasty.

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:23.677
I just had to get the
hell out of there.

to put his junk in my...

try to put his hands on me.

This is classic Costello.

full of shit, you know.

staring at this
seven-foot-tall monster,

chasing the two across
this castle back and forth,


907

like one of those old

bite it from their fall?

00:43:36.322 --> 00:43:37.236
Yeah, man, but you said

918
00:43:37.238 --> 00:43:39.155
they fell off the
side of the castle.


919
00:43:39.157 --> 00:43:40.160
Yeah, but bro,

920
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.328
the only way to kill Dracula

921
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.288
is by sunlight or a
stake through the heart.


922
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.123
And everybody knows
you need silver bullets

to kill a werewolf.

924
00:43:50.544 --> 00:43:52.505
So neither one of them
would've been killed


925
00:43:52.507 --> 00:43:53.883
from their falls.

926

and Costello, right?
