00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.059
Boss Chan

4
00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:00.518
It's been a year

5
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:02.476
You look well

6
00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:04.309
Hello, Da Bao!

7
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:10.018
We're always the first to arrive at reunions

8
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:13.184
Where have you been this past year?

9
00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:15.809
Lots of small places

10
00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.768
Red packets...

11
00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:19.393
What are we celebrating?

12
00:02:19.768 --> 00:02:21.226
My dad died last month

13
00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:22.893
Why are you celebrating?

14
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:26.059
We're celebrating

15
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:29.226
my $1,750 million inheritance!

16
00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.393
Tonight,

17
00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.851
everything is on me!

18
00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:36.518
Who is Boss Chan?

19
00:02:36.893 --> 00:02:39.268
A rich man's son

20
00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.601
my target

21
00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:42.893
what do you think?

22
00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:45.434
Not bad

23
00:02:45.893 --> 00:02:47.226
Not him

24
00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.559
He's very... unique

25
00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.518
His companion looks better

26
00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:55.518
but is useless

27
00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:58.934
because

28
00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.809
he doesn't spend

29
00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:02.559
his father's money

30
00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:06.268
Your wine tastes refined

31
00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:10.434
This is from Bordeaux, France?

32
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.268
It must cost at least $20,000 per bottle

33
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.059
Amazing

34
00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:16.643
it's from Yunnan

35
00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:18.268
D85 per bottle

36
00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:21.893
No way

37
00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:24.268
D85?

38
00:03:27.643 --> 00:03:28.809
We can't drink that!

39
00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:30.101
Boss Chan

40
00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:32.393
Come, Tao

41
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.643
It's been another year

42
00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:37.143
Yes, time passes too quickly

43
00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:40.309
Last year you promised me a handbag

44
00:03:41.018 --> 00:03:42.809
I did! Here, come get your bag!

45
00:03:42.976 --> 00:03:44.643
- Come, get your bag
- Thank you, Boss Chan


46
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:46.309
This beauty is...

47
00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.976
She's new, she's only been here two months

48
00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:49.018
Newbie gets a handbag, too

49
00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:50.976
Here, take a bag

50
00:03:51.643 --> 00:03:52.768
Where is the restroom, please?

51
00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:53.768
This way

52
00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:54.643
Thanks

53
00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:58.434
Look,

54
00:03:59.393 --> 00:04:01.476
Ho brought this from Changchun

55
00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:11.143
Hello

56
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:12.309
Where is Boss Chan?

57
00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:13.434
He said

58
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.768
he's busy. He left

59
00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:23.351
Company fortunes fail,

60
00:04:23.518 --> 00:04:24.809
Former Billionaire CEO Lin Yuanxing vanishes

61
00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:27.976
Uncle Wang, I'm Si
-Qi.

62
00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.976
Have you heard from my dad?

63
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:34.018
He's disappeared for days,

64
00:04:34.184 --> 00:04:35.559
we're looking for him too

65
00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:38.893
He's in deep trouble, while you were gone

66
00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.476
he lost billions in the real estate market

67
00:04:42.268 --> 00:04:47.643
"Macau"

68
00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:52.101
Hurry, Mommy, I'm hungry

69
00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:03.226
Dani,

70
00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.559
turn off the bathtub tap for me

71
00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:07.059
All right!

72
00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:43.393
"Hong Kong"

73
00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:44.934
Hello, yes...

74
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:46.268
how much is in my account?

75
00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:47.976
Fine...

76
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:50.893
Winner all up, 2 x 3

77
00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:52.976
horse 5 in race 3

78
00:05:57.851 --> 00:06:00.768
- It's the last 100m!
- Don't let him pass!


79
00:06:01.268 --> 00:06:03.309
- Push...
- Where did you learn how to drive?


80
00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:07.059
- Push... Whip...
- Come out!


81
00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:09.393
- Push... Whip...
- Where did you learn how to drive?


82
00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.726
- Push... Whip...
- Come out or I'll call the cops!


83
00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:14.601
Come out or I'll call the cops!

84
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:17.934
Sorry, Buddy, what's going on?

85
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:19.518
You wrecked my car!

86
00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:21.101
So I did.

87
00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:22.143
Here's $300

88
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:24.851
Only $300? The whole front is ruined!

89
00:06:25.976 --> 00:06:26.476
In that case,

90
00:06:26.934 --> 00:06:28.101
I know the boss at a body shop

91
00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:29.809
bring him the car

92
00:06:30.018 --> 00:06:31.309
Tell him Scumbag Fai sent you

93
00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:32.934
I'll pay whatever he estimates

94
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:33.893
No kidding

95
00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:35.309
It's true

96
00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:38.393
I can take you there now

97
00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:40.018
Stay or I'll call the cops

98
00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:41.226
Don't worry, I'll stay,

99
00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:44.476
I'm so sorry

100
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:09.059
Scumbag Fai

101
00:07:09.268 --> 00:07:10.976
you're 3 payments late

102
00:07:42.476 --> 00:07:47.226
"Macau"

103
00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:05.726
My bet is on the foreigner

104
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:07.226
what do you think?

105
00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:09.726
Foreigners

106
00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:11.434
use brute strength

107
00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:12.934
they always lose

108
00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.518
But I made a big bet!

109
00:08:35.893 --> 00:08:39.559
Fai

110
00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:04.143
Mixed Martial Arts

111
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:06.434
is different from boxing

112
00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:08.226
Boxing only had a few moves

113
00:09:08.726 --> 00:09:10.601
Moves with elbows, knees and feet

114
00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:13.351
in Thai Boxing will exhaust you

115
00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:15.226
Add judo and ground holds

116
00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:16.809
you're dead

117
00:09:18.643 --> 00:09:20.726
It's hard to be
an MMA fighter these days

118
00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:21.851
Yes,

119
00:09:22.684 --> 00:09:24.976
but excitement brings viewership

120
00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:27.351
And with that comes betting

121
00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:29.976
How much do you owe?

122
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:34.101
$200,000 or so

123
00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:36.851
Twenty-odd thousand

124
00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:39.643
That's good, $200,000 or so

125
00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:41.601
Good in what way?

126
00:09:42.643 --> 00:09:44.059
We can handle it

127
00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:46.434
I got you a job at the gym

128
00:09:47.226 --> 00:09:48.476
where I work

129
00:09:49.184 --> 00:09:50.601
Housing is easy

130
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:53.809
I found you a nice room

131
00:09:56.184 --> 00:09:57.684
Master left last month

132
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.434
Liver cancer

133
00:10:00.518 --> 00:10:03.809
his last two months were bad

134
00:10:06.851 --> 00:10:07.809
He's gone

135
00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:10.309
however you felt about each other

136
00:10:10.518 --> 00:10:12.018
burn some incense for
him when you have time

137
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:13.976
He's taught us for so long,

138
00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:15.143
after all

139
00:10:27.851 --> 00:10:28.726
Thank You

Golden Rumble Mixed Martial Arts Championship

The battle starts this summer. Apply now!

00:11:19.893 --> 00:11:21.976
"Knock Gently"

145
00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:39.934
Can't you read?

146
00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:41.309
Knock gently

147
00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:42.934
I tried that

148
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:44.101
Are you Scumbag Fai?

149
00:11:44.268 --> 00:11:45.226
Ching Fai

150
00:11:45.393 --> 00:11:47.268
Landlord said Scumbag Fai

151
00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:48.559
Must be someone else

152
00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:52.143
All right, Scumbag Fai, then

153
00:11:55.393 --> 00:11:57.143
Take off your shoes

154
00:11:57.476 --> 00:11:59.643
It's dark

155
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:01.434
turn on some lights

156
00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:02.976
Shh!

157
00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:15.684
Don't wake my mother

158
00:12:18.643 --> 00:12:20.434
She doesn't like people to drink alcohol

159
00:12:20.643 --> 00:12:22.559
If you must, drink in your room

160
00:12:22.893 --> 00:12:24.976
She can't see us

161
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:28.559
Let me tell you the rules

162
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:31.809
1. After 10pm, be quiet

163
00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:33.643
and leave these lights out

164
00:12:34.768 --> 00:12:37.351
2. Everything in the kitchen is ours,

165
00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:38.851
not yours

166
00:12:39.184 --> 00:12:41.518
Hang up laundry in your own room

167
00:12:41.768 --> 00:12:44.684
All these rules; you
think you own this place?

168
00:12:44.851 --> 00:12:48.393
We were here first; our rules apply

169
00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:51.809
Your room is next
door; this is the bathroom

170
00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:53.976
Thanks

171
00:12:54.518 --> 00:12:55.309
What?

172
00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:57.143
Don't stand when you pee

173
00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:59.226
You men always spray everywhere

174
00:12:59.393 --> 00:13:00.143
Disgusting

175
00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:00.518
All right

176
00:13:00.684 --> 00:13:01.768
I'm not done!

177
00:13:02.268 --> 00:13:04.018
Don't use the bathtub

178
00:13:04.226 --> 00:13:05.684
don't move that board

179
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.893
Stand and use that shower,

180
00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:08.851
understand?

181
00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:10.518
I really must go, Girl!

182
00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:12.184
Don't call me Girl.

183
00:13:12.393 --> 00:13:13.393
I'm Leung Pui-dan

184
00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.851
Call me Dani. Goodnight!

185
00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:34.393
What is it?

186
00:13:36.768 --> 00:13:37.893
You stole our refrigerator!

187
00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:39.684
You're kidding!

188
00:13:39.893 --> 00:13:41.559
It was hot

189
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:43.434
The air conditioner broke

190
00:13:43.684 --> 00:13:45.309
So I used the fridge

191
00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:47.226
See how frightened my mother is?

192
00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:53.476
What's wrong with her?

193
00:13:54.726 --> 00:13:56.851
Give back the fridge

194
00:13:57.018 --> 00:13:58.893
"Don't Touch"

195
00:14:08.768 --> 00:14:09.976
- Morning
- Morning


196
00:14:10.268 --> 00:14:11.268
Good morning

197
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:13.393
Good morning

198
00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:21.934
What are you drinking?

199
00:14:24.268 --> 00:14:25.268
Iron Buddha

200
00:14:27.268 --> 00:14:29.143
I told you not to drink out here

201
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:31.768
It's Iron Buddha tea!

202
00:14:55.643 --> 00:14:56.809
Go hammer rocks today

203
00:14:58.143 --> 00:14:59.351
Wai wants me on the jackhammer

204
00:14:59.518 --> 00:15:01.143
Do what I tell you

205
00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:10.476
He took half of your jackhammer pay

206
00:15:13.184 --> 00:15:15.351
Never mind. Just eat

207
00:15:30.434 --> 00:15:32.226
This place is older than you are

208
00:15:32.476 --> 00:15:33.976
It's broken-down

209
00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.809
but many people come

210
00:15:37.809 --> 00:15:39.184
You even have this!

211
00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:40.768
More and more new people

212
00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:42.226
are trying it

213
00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:47.559
There will be a Golden Rumble MMA Championship

214
00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:52.559
with a huge purse

215
00:15:53.143 --> 00:15:55.018
Over $2 million!

216
00:15:55.434 --> 00:15:56.393
Wear these

217
00:15:57.684 --> 00:15:58.976
Every day,

218
00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:02.184
wipe the gloves, clean up the place

219
00:16:02.476 --> 00:16:05.393
Help teach some classes

220
00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:08.393
it's a simple life

221
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:10.393
It's a great retirement job

222
00:16:13.393 --> 00:16:14.851
Good morning, girls!

223
00:16:15.226 --> 00:16:16.726
Good morning, sir!

224
00:16:18.518 --> 00:16:21.434
Meet our new assistant coach

225
00:16:21.851 --> 00:16:23.393
Ching Fai

226
00:16:23.893 --> 00:16:26.184
A two-time Golden Belt Champion

227
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:28.309
He has an amazing upper cut

228
00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:30.226
Gosh, he's old

229
00:16:30.393 --> 00:16:31.559
As long as he's a Champion!

230
00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:32.809
Ready

231
00:16:33.393 --> 00:16:36.184
One, two, jab, jab, five, six, seven, eight

232
00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:39.393
Two, two, jab, jab, five, six, seven, eight

233
00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:44.226
One, two, jab, jab, five, six, seven, eight

234
00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:47.184
Two, two, jab, jab, five, six, seven, eight

235
00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:50.434
One, two, jab, jab, five, six, seven, eight

236
00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:52.726
Two, two, jab, jab, five, six, seven...

237
00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:55.559
Goodbye! That was great

238
00:16:57.601 --> 00:16:59.059
Good bye

239
00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:00.768
Isn't that cool?

240
00:17:00.934 --> 00:17:02.934
Such easy lessons!

241
00:17:03.226 --> 00:17:05.101
Just make them happy

242
00:17:05.934 --> 00:17:07.018
What an insult!

243
00:17:08.476 --> 00:17:10.226
What insult?

244
00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:11.476
At your age?

245
00:17:12.143 --> 00:17:14.309
You'll grow into it

246
00:17:14.851 --> 00:17:15.559
There's another class later

247
00:17:15.726 --> 00:17:16.601
Another one?

248
00:17:16.934 --> 00:17:17.934
Yes

249
00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:33.809
Coach Rock, he's signed up

250
00:17:34.018 --> 00:17:35.434
to learn MMA

251
00:17:36.934 --> 00:17:37.809
Have you taken lessons?

252
00:17:38.976 --> 00:17:39.976
One year of Taekwondo

253
00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:42.268
Show me some moves

254
00:17:42.434 --> 00:17:43.143
Sure

255
00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:48.976
Okay

256
00:17:49.434 --> 00:17:51.309
We don't fight like that here

257
00:17:51.934 --> 00:17:54.143
Learn some basics

258
00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:56.309
Hoi

259
00:17:56.934 --> 00:17:57.934
Teach him how to use sandbags

260
00:17:58.101 --> 00:17:58.809
Yes!

261
00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:00.184
Coach,

262
00:18:02.434 --> 00:18:04.601
I've signed up for the MMA Match

263
00:18:04.893 --> 00:18:06.309
I want to learn more

264
00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:07.684
I don't have much time.

265
00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:09.934
Please give me more lessons

266
00:18:10.101 --> 00:18:10.934
Anything

267
00:18:11.434 --> 00:18:12.643
You'll get beat up in a match

268
00:18:12.976 --> 00:18:14.518
can you take it?

269
00:18:14.934 --> 00:18:16.851
Yes, I really can

270
00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:31.434
Wipe down the ring floor

271
00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:45.643
Something wrong?

272
00:19:47.226 --> 00:19:48.518
Not with me,

273
00:19:49.226 --> 00:19:50.476
with you

274
00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:52.809
Blocking a kick

275
00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:56.976
with your belly is suicidal

276
00:19:57.309 --> 00:19:58.268
Next time,

277
00:19:58.934 --> 00:20:01.809
try blocking with your shin

278
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:03.184
That hurts, too

279
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:05.601
Yes, it hurts both of you

280
00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.393
That's better than if only you get hurt

281
00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:09.601
right?

282
00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:20.976
Dani!

283
00:22:22.726 --> 00:22:25.643
Mom, let's go home
when the rain dies down

284
00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:34.601
What's with the water?

285
00:22:35.268 --> 00:22:36.643
It's from our home!

286
00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:42.768
Good, you're home

287
00:22:42.976 --> 00:22:44.893
What's wrong with this place!

288
00:22:45.226 --> 00:22:47.101
It was never this bad!

289
00:22:47.268 --> 00:22:48.101
Hurry, help!

290
00:22:48.268 --> 00:22:48.809
All right!

291
00:22:49.268 --> 00:22:50.809
Go back to your room, Mom

292
00:22:55.184 --> 00:22:57.018
Your toilets are all blocked!

293
00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.268
Stop!

294
00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:26.143
Stay away from my bathtub!

295
00:23:26.393 --> 00:23:28.018
You touched my bathtub, why!

296
00:23:28.143 --> 00:23:29.976
Why did you touch my bathtub?

297
00:23:30.268 --> 00:23:31.601
You're trying to kill him!

298
00:23:32.101 --> 00:23:35.309
- Your mother...
- You're trying to kill him!


299
00:23:36.184 --> 00:23:38.309
Get out!

300
00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:42.393
Mother, everything's fine!

301
00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:45.101
It's fine! Mother!

302
00:23:45.268 --> 00:23:48.476
No, Mother!

303
00:23:48.643 --> 00:23:50.351
No, Mother!

304
00:24:05.976 --> 00:24:08.184
Mother's asleep. 
You may go back down

305
00:24:08.351 --> 00:24:09.226
Don't wake her

306
00:24:09.393 --> 00:24:12.143
Wait, look, she scratched me badly

307
00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:13.684
You're at fault

308
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:15.976
You should apologize to us

309
00:24:16.184 --> 00:24:18.309
I mean, she did this,

310
00:24:18.476 --> 00:24:19.726
is she nuts?

311
00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:21.643
Do not say my mother is nuts

312
00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:23.184
- You're evil!
- What are you doing!


313
00:24:23.351 --> 00:24:25.518
- What are you doing!
- You evil person, you scum


314
00:24:25.684 --> 00:24:26.184
What are you doing!

315
00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:27.143
You are so evil

316
00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:28.393
Stop it!

317
00:24:29.518 --> 00:24:31.643
You evil person, you scum

318
00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:33.226
Stop it!

319
00:24:40.226 --> 00:24:41.101
Sorry.

320
00:24:42.268 --> 00:24:44.184
Sorry, please stop crying

321
00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:51.018
Sorry...

322
00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:54.226
Sorry...

323
00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:56.393
Sorry... okay?

324
00:25:03.726 --> 00:25:05.601
Don't bully us anymore

325
00:25:06.226 --> 00:25:07.893
What happened to her?

326
00:25:09.018 --> 00:25:10.018
I'm not telling

327
00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:14.768
Then I'll continue to
break rules in your home

328
00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:19.893
All right,

329
00:25:20.143 --> 00:25:21.684
but don't tell anyone else

330
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:24.601
Why would I? Tell me

331
00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:29.351
Father left Mother, me and my brother

332
00:25:30.268 --> 00:25:34.268
for another woman 4 years ago

333
00:25:47.018 --> 00:25:50.601
Mother lost the will to live,

334
00:25:51.768 --> 00:25:53.309
and drank every day

335
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:01.809
After my brother died

336
00:26:03.268 --> 00:26:05.518
she started talking to herself

337
00:26:05.976 --> 00:26:09.184
Saying it's her fault he died

338
00:26:10.018 --> 00:26:11.476
She wanted to die,

339
00:26:13.184 --> 00:26:14.768
but luckily she's fine

340
00:26:15.476 --> 00:26:18.643
They locked her up in a mental hospital

341
00:26:20.976 --> 00:26:24.476
Social Welfare sent me to a Home

342
00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:28.268
I hated it

343
00:26:28.809 --> 00:26:31.976
It was like prison

344
00:26:36.434 --> 00:26:37.684
Why didn't you

345
00:26:38.351 --> 00:26:40.059
tell me this before?

346
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:42.518
Mother has recovered.

347
00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:44.851
She's not crazy

348
00:26:45.434 --> 00:26:46.226
Good to know

349
00:26:47.476 --> 00:26:50.351
I'll follow the house rules from now on

350
00:26:50.726 --> 00:26:53.893
I'll do whatever you say, all right?

351
00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:56.893
When you go downstairs

352
00:26:57.643 --> 00:26:58.976
be quiet

353
00:26:59.143 --> 00:27:01.601
It took me forever to
get her to fall asleep

354
00:27:01.976 --> 00:27:04.018
Will she attack me again?

355
00:27:05.184 --> 00:27:06.851
You think she's crazy again!

356
00:27:07.518 --> 00:27:08.726
I don't

357
00:27:10.726 --> 00:27:12.309
Can you make me breakfast tomorrow?

358
00:27:12.518 --> 00:27:13.226
No

359
00:27:14.226 --> 00:27:15.601
Miser

360
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:25.518
I'm Fai

361
00:27:30.768 --> 00:27:31.726
I'm Gwen

362
00:27:38.434 --> 00:27:41.268
My daughter is young,
don't bring her into your room


363
00:27:42.476 --> 00:27:43.893
And you may not enter our room

364
00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:46.268
I'm not a bad guy

365
00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:47.851
Just speak Cantonese

366
00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.559
I'm not a bad guy

367
00:27:52.893 --> 00:27:54.184
If anything goes wrong,

368
00:27:54.518 --> 00:27:55.976
I'll call the cops

369
00:28:02.893 --> 00:28:04.768
One, two, three, four

370
00:28:06.268 --> 00:28:08.059
If you touch me you will die

371
00:28:09.434 --> 00:28:11.268
Five, six, seven, eight...

372
00:28:11.976 --> 00:28:13.434
Repeat! Ready,

373
00:28:13.601 --> 00:28:15.726
1, 2, 3, 4...

374
00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:20.851
"Die like a fly"

375
00:28:21.518 --> 00:28:22.768
What are you doing!

376
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:24.476
What are you doing?

377
00:28:24.809 --> 00:28:28.101
I'm dancing joyfully and to the beat

378
00:28:28.268 --> 00:28:29.434
You're off

379
00:28:29.768 --> 00:28:32.018
No, I think I'm
to the beat and joyful

380
00:28:32.184 --> 00:28:33.476
Your dancing affects

381
00:28:33.643 --> 00:28:35.601
development of our minds and bodies

382
00:28:38.351 --> 00:28:41.101
How much more developed
do you want to get?

383
00:28:41.893 --> 00:28:44.809
You can't say that! 
I'll file a complaint

384
00:28:46.268 --> 00:28:49.601
Don't! He's the boss! Be happy!

385
00:28:51.226 --> 00:28:52.518
Joyful? No problem.

386
00:28:52.684 --> 00:28:53.934
Sorry, then, okay?

387
00:28:54.101 --> 00:28:55.434
Come, again!

388
00:28:55.976 --> 00:28:58.018
Come on, beauties!

389
00:28:58.601 --> 00:29:01.934
Ready, 1, 2, 3, 4

390
00:29:37.684 --> 00:29:39.601
Lose two games

391
00:29:40.018 --> 00:29:41.559
and no one will bet on you

392
00:29:42.976 --> 00:29:46.018
How long will this money last you?

393
00:29:47.684 --> 00:29:50.393
Come work for me

394
00:29:52.518 --> 00:29:54.018
7

395
00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:55.809
8

396
00:29:56.393 --> 00:29:57.643
"Fai"

397
00:29:57.976 --> 00:29:59.184
9

398
00:30:22.809 --> 00:30:23.226
Master...

399
00:30:23.434 --> 00:30:24.434
Damn you!

400
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:26.434
You faked matches for Wei-keung!

401
00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:29.768
You worked so hard,
then gave up on yourself!

402
00:30:50.976 --> 00:30:51.934
Ching Fai,

403
00:30:52.268 --> 00:30:54.601
you're under arrest for

404
00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:57.059
mob-related activities, money laundering and

405
00:30:57.226 --> 00:30:58.601
fixing boxing matches 2 years ago

406
00:31:36.434 --> 00:31:37.643
Scumbag Fai,

407
00:31:38.893 --> 00:31:40.601
can you teach me boxing?

408
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:42.351
Nonsense.

409
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:44.268
are you leaving yet? 
I'm closing up

410
00:31:44.643 --> 00:31:46.143
They say you're a champion

411
00:31:46.518 --> 00:31:47.476
teach me

412
00:31:49.018 --> 00:31:49.809
boxing

413
00:31:52.018 --> 00:31:53.934
Lock up for me when you go

414
00:32:04.851 --> 00:32:05.309
Hello?

415
00:32:05.518 --> 00:32:06.726
Scumbag Fai...

416
00:32:07.851 --> 00:32:09.893
Learn some English, it's C
-H
-I
-N
-G

417
00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:11.393
Whatever,

418
00:32:11.684 --> 00:32:14.184
I have detention today, so I'll be late

419
00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:16.726
Can you pick up my mother? 
It'll rain soon

420
00:32:17.643 --> 00:32:21.184
I worry she won't go home without me

421
00:32:22.851 --> 00:32:23.559
Which park is she in?

422
00:32:30.684 --> 00:32:31.351
Hey, let's go!

423
00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:35.018
Go home!

424
00:32:36.268 --> 00:32:38.851
It's raining, stay away from the tree!

425
00:32:51.726 --> 00:32:53.351
You hold it, I'll fix the rest

426
00:33:18.893 --> 00:33:22.559
The Big Bad Wolf was tried

427
00:33:22.726 --> 00:33:25.059
for eating the 3 Little Pigs

428
00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:26.059
What was

429
00:33:26.226 --> 00:33:29.393
the first thing he told the judge?

430
00:33:29.768 --> 00:33:30.643
He'd confess

431
00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:32.143
No,

432
00:33:32.393 --> 00:33:36.768
"I'm actually vegetarian."

433
00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:38.893
Impossible!

434
00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:39.893
Really!

435
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:44.434
Wolf said, "I was baking Granny

436
00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:46.559
a birthday cake

437
00:33:46.726 --> 00:33:50.559
I ran out of sugar
and went to borrow some

438
00:33:50.726 --> 00:33:53.434
I went to the straw hut,
but I had the flu... "

439
00:34:01.976 --> 00:34:04.434
Have you seen Mother's headphones?

440
00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:06.768
- Headphones?
- Yes


441
00:34:07.101 --> 00:34:10.976
No, wait, maybe I
saw them in the kitchen

442
00:34:11.518 --> 00:34:12.934
Okay

443
00:34:25.143 --> 00:34:27.559
One, this

444
00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:29.393
These headphones?

445
00:34:29.684 --> 00:34:30.809
Yes, these

446
00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.476
We both speak Chinese, give me a discount

447
00:34:39.851 --> 00:34:40.809
I'll take $10 off

448
00:34:42.643 --> 00:34:43.643
I'll take it

449
00:34:53.809 --> 00:34:54.351
Boss?

450
00:34:54.643 --> 00:34:55.476
Yes?

451
00:34:56.184 --> 00:34:57.226
What song is this?

452
00:34:57.393 --> 00:34:58.809
I don't know

453
00:35:00.226 --> 00:35:01.101
Can you give it to me?

454
00:35:01.393 --> 00:35:02.934
Sure, it's free

455
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:07.643
I'm going to kill you, you bastard

456
00:35:09.976 --> 00:35:10.851
What are you looking at?

457
00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.184
Get up

458
00:35:21.976 --> 00:35:22.726
Scram!

459
00:35:26.768 --> 00:35:28.101
Father! What happened?

460
00:35:32.351 --> 00:35:33.351
Scram!

461
00:35:34.518 --> 00:35:37.684
I'm not here so you can despise me!

462
00:35:38.059 --> 00:35:39.434
When I was successful,

463
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:41.851
I was a god to you

464
00:35:42.893 --> 00:35:44.184
Now I've failed, right?

465
00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.934
I've failed, isn't that right?

466
00:35:46.226 --> 00:35:49.018
You treat me like dirt

467
00:35:49.184 --> 00:35:50.184
Father!

468
00:35:51.059 --> 00:35:53.559
I'll die right here,

469
00:35:53.768 --> 00:35:54.976
like this!

470
00:35:55.143 --> 00:35:57.143
- Here, I'll show you,
- Father!


471
00:35:57.934 --> 00:36:00.018
okay? Haha..

472
00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:02.393
I'll die now!

473
00:36:02.559 --> 00:36:04.893
I started from nothing,

474
00:36:05.268 --> 00:36:06.684
working since my 20's

475
00:36:07.768 --> 00:36:09.393
How dare you despise me

476
00:36:10.934 --> 00:36:12.768
How dare you despise me!

477
00:36:14.643 --> 00:36:15.893
How dare you despise me!

478
00:36:18.101 --> 00:36:20.059
Father, let's go!

479
00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:25.143
You despise me!

480
00:36:33.351 --> 00:36:34.434
How dare you despise me!

481
00:36:37.268 --> 00:36:38.934
Father, stop it!

482
00:36:39.101 --> 00:36:40.851
How long will you
keep this up? Shut up!

483
00:36:41.018 --> 00:36:42.226
Lin Si
-Qi!

484
00:36:44.059 --> 00:36:47.393
I made it when I was 30!

485
00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:48.601
And you?

486
00:36:48.976 --> 00:36:51.768
You still don't know
what you want to do!

487
00:36:52.768 --> 00:36:55.226
You didn't, you can't do anything!

488
00:36:55.601 --> 00:36:58.643
Useless!

489
00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:04.018
You don't know what responsibility is!

490
00:37:04.768 --> 00:37:06.101
You just don't know

491
00:37:08.934 --> 00:37:09.643
What!

492
00:37:13.476 --> 00:37:14.309
Father!

493
00:37:15.393 --> 00:37:16.143
Father!

494
00:37:18.143 --> 00:37:19.476
Quiet,

495
00:37:20.018 --> 00:37:22.309
your neighbors have to work in the morning

496
00:37:22.684 --> 00:37:23.809
Sorry

497
00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:28.851
Sorry

498
00:37:35.143 --> 00:37:36.101
Amazing!

499
00:37:36.268 --> 00:37:38.643
You bruised my dad with one punch

500
00:37:39.809 --> 00:37:41.393
It's nothing serious

501
00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:46.643
Your dad meant business, he made you bleed

502
00:37:47.893 --> 00:37:49.476
You're still bleeding

503
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:51.184
Sit down,

504
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:54.518
what are you looking at

505
00:38:11.351 --> 00:38:12.184
What are you doing?

506
00:38:15.476 --> 00:38:16.184
Come

507
00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:20.851
Put pressure on it

508
00:38:21.143 --> 00:38:22.059
Will it work?

509
00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:24.934
I don't know, it's what everyone else does

510
00:38:25.101 --> 00:38:26.726
I did that when I was young

511
00:38:27.351 --> 00:38:28.518
Thanks, Scumbag Fai

512
00:38:30.434 --> 00:38:31.726
Speak in Putonghua

513
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:35.226
Scumbag Fai,

514
00:38:36.768 --> 00:38:38.184
please teach me boxing

515
00:38:39.143 --> 00:38:40.851
I want to join the MMA championship

516
00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:42.351
I really want to

517
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:45.518
You need money?

518
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:49.351
MMA is not a game

519
00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:52.934
Anything you teach me would be great

520
00:38:57.518 --> 00:39:00.059
Then we'll split your winnings six-four.

521
00:39:00.684 --> 00:39:01.684
No problem!

522
00:39:03.434 --> 00:39:04.601
Six for me, four for you

523
00:39:04.976 --> 00:39:06.601
Fine

524
00:39:08.393 --> 00:39:09.643
No

525
00:39:10.059 --> 00:39:11.268
You're the one fighting

526
00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:14.101
I'll take a loss, six
for you, four for me

527
00:39:14.601 --> 00:39:15.601
Even better!

528
00:39:16.018 --> 00:39:17.059
So that's a "yes"?

529
00:39:18.351 --> 00:39:19.601
Let me remind you

530
00:39:19.976 --> 00:39:23.101
It's only two and a
half months till the match

531
00:39:23.768 --> 00:39:25.934
It's actually not a matter of coaching

532
00:39:26.184 --> 00:39:29.059
Win or lose, it all depends on you

533
00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:30.934
Fine!

534
00:39:31.101 --> 00:39:32.976
Thank you, Scumbag Fai!

535
00:39:33.434 --> 00:39:36.601
Can't you speak in Putonghua?

536
00:39:38.518 --> 00:39:39.393
Thanks,

537
00:39:40.434 --> 00:39:41.268
Thanks,

538
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:42.976
Scumbag Fai!

539
00:39:43.101 --> 00:39:44.101
Take care!

540
00:39:46.768 --> 00:39:48.143
See you at the gym tomorrow!

541
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:52.268
Yes!

542
00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:56.809
Good night!

543
00:40:02.809 --> 00:40:05.643
"Fai bought new headphones"

544
00:40:35.518 --> 00:40:38.851
A fighter must have his own rhythm

545
00:40:40.684 --> 00:40:42.851
Make your opponent follow it,

546
00:40:43.434 --> 00:40:45.143
and you lead him

547
00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.351
1, 2

548
00:40:46.976 --> 00:40:47.976
1, 2, 3

549
00:40:49.184 --> 00:40:49.934
1, 2

550
00:40:51.476 --> 00:40:54.893
The rhythm is step, dodge, fake

551
00:40:55.268 --> 00:40:56.601
When you see the chance, punch him out!

552
00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:57.976
Come on

553
00:40:58.268 --> 00:41:01.309
Fight in your combination to make your rhythm

554
00:41:01.684 --> 00:41:04.559
Vary your combinations to be a good fighter

555
00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:08.518
What are you doing?

556
00:41:08.684 --> 00:41:09.601
You're attacking me?

557
00:41:10.226 --> 00:41:11.851
Countering? Run!

558
00:41:12.726 --> 00:41:13.726
Speed Bag

559
00:41:14.226 --> 00:41:15.101
is not about strength

560
00:41:16.684 --> 00:41:17.809
but distance

561
00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:20.559
and feel

562
00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:26.518
Sorry.

563
00:41:27.893 --> 00:41:29.226
It's fine; again.

564
00:41:31.226 --> 00:41:32.143
Sorry.

565
00:41:36.101 --> 00:41:37.226
It's fine; again.

566
00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:51.518
You ate the egg I
was rolling on my bruises?

567
00:41:52.393 --> 00:41:53.768
Damn you, Scumbag Fai

568
00:42:06.393 --> 00:42:07.143
Faster

569
00:42:08.934 --> 00:42:10.101
Wrench!

570
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:12.309
Coming!

571
00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:13.934
What's the rush?

572
00:42:22.601 --> 00:42:23.684
Oh, no!

573
00:42:24.601 --> 00:42:27.518
How could you? 
What do we do now?

574
00:42:29.851 --> 00:42:31.976
Get soap; don't waste the water;

575
00:42:32.184 --> 00:42:33.809
shower and shampoo

576
00:42:34.559 --> 00:42:36.476
Are you nuts?

577
00:42:41.143 --> 00:42:42.309
Faster still

578
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:12.309
Hurry, Master

579
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:27.684
Exhausted?

580
00:43:28.684 --> 00:43:29.351
I'm fine

581
00:43:29.518 --> 00:43:30.643
Rest; don't mind me

582
00:43:30.851 --> 00:43:31.559
Thanks

583
00:43:34.226 --> 00:43:35.559
- Ignore me
- Why are you hitting me?


584
00:43:36.434 --> 00:43:37.393
Rest

585
00:43:44.934 --> 00:43:49.976
Last time, we asked why Wolf

586
00:43:50.226 --> 00:43:52.184
had to eat both Pigs

587
00:43:52.809 --> 00:43:54.351
Let's continue

588
00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:05.184
After I, Wolf, ate the first pig,

589
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.809
I was sad

590
00:44:07.018 --> 00:44:08.351
And afterwards

591
00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:10.059
I continued to hunt for sugar

592
00:44:10.559 --> 00:44:13.434
I walked on

593
00:44:13.601 --> 00:44:15.393
until I saw the next house

594
00:44:15.559 --> 00:44:17.643
I saw the second pig

595
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:19.143
So then...

596
00:44:19.393 --> 00:44:21.018
It's your turn; so then...

597
00:44:21.184 --> 00:44:24.393
Yes, I saw the second pig

598
00:44:25.268 --> 00:44:27.059
I knocked on the door. Knock, knock

599
00:44:27.226 --> 00:44:29.184
Can I borrow some sugar?

600
00:44:29.768 --> 00:44:31.851
Not only did he refuse,

601
00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:33.518
he stomped on me

602
00:44:34.726 --> 00:44:37.309
So I dodged

603
00:44:37.726 --> 00:44:39.434
while he stomped

604
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:40.601
Stomp!

605
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:43.226
He threw a jar of pepper at me

606
00:44:43.393 --> 00:44:44.226
Throw!

607
00:44:44.434 --> 00:44:46.726
"Ah-choo!"

608
00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:47.726
Oh, no!

609
00:44:48.184 --> 00:44:51.393
I've blown the second pig's house down

610
00:44:51.643 --> 00:44:54.101
I ran into save him,

611
00:44:54.518 --> 00:44:55.893
but I saw

612
00:44:56.101 --> 00:45:00.643
that he had been
crushed to death by rocks

613
00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:03.768
So, I was full,

614
00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:06.434
and didn't want to eat him

615
00:45:06.768 --> 00:45:08.309
but I thought

616
00:45:08.559 --> 00:45:11.601
another passing wolf would eat him

617
00:45:11.893 --> 00:45:14.601
Besides, that pig was just laying there

618
00:45:14.768 --> 00:45:16.101
Without refrigeration

619
00:45:16.351 --> 00:45:17.934
he would rot

620
00:45:18.101 --> 00:45:20.976
so reluctantly I ate him, too

621
00:45:21.434 --> 00:45:24.101
So, bite, bite

622
00:45:24.726 --> 00:45:27.101
This meat is very tough

623
00:45:27.268 --> 00:45:29.976
I'll try the waist; bite...

624
00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:31.809
You're dead, don't move

625
00:45:31.976 --> 00:45:33.976
Try the waist, try the neck...

626
00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:36.143
Stop it, ha, ha, ha

627
00:45:37.934 --> 00:45:40.601
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

628
00:45:41.143 --> 00:45:44.559
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

629
00:45:44.726 --> 00:45:48.268
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

630
00:45:48.434 --> 00:45:50.934
Good, Beauties!

631
00:45:51.351 --> 00:45:53.351
See you tomorrow

632
00:45:54.143 --> 00:45:56.309
Goodbye, Coach Fai

633
00:45:58.309 --> 00:46:00.559
He seems much happier today

634
00:46:00.851 --> 00:46:02.309
I feel that too!

635
00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:04.643
Even the way he
looks at me has changed

636
00:46:04.809 --> 00:46:06.393
And today,

637
00:46:06.518 --> 00:46:10.101
his smile is like Andy Lau's

638
00:46:18.434 --> 00:46:20.351
Hey! Hit the sandbags

639
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:33.393
Shall I take you to hospital?

640
00:46:33.684 --> 00:46:35.351
You look exhausted

641
00:46:37.393 --> 00:46:38.309
Give me one

642
00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:46.684
He's quite good

643
00:46:47.684 --> 00:46:50.559
He's a quick learner

644
00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:52.851
Yes

645
00:46:53.559 --> 00:46:55.559
His strength is his dedication

646
00:46:55.726 --> 00:46:56.768
You see?

647
00:46:59.268 --> 00:47:00.809
But he could have done better

648
00:47:01.184 --> 00:47:02.976
if I had coached him

649
00:47:06.143 --> 00:47:07.893
Of course! No question about that

650
00:48:46.101 --> 00:48:50.184
Forget it; you cannot
eat that for a while

651
00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:55.684
It's time you learn some holds techniques

652
00:48:56.434 --> 00:48:59.101
Yes, but Coach Rock is busy

653
00:48:59.393 --> 00:49:01.018
Teaching Edwin

654
00:49:02.976 --> 00:49:05.018
Take the initiative and ask him

655
00:49:05.351 --> 00:49:06.351
How?

656
00:49:06.768 --> 00:49:09.559
You pay every month; he must teach you

657
00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:13.393
Coach Rock

658
00:49:14.059 --> 00:49:15.018
Yes?

659
00:49:17.143 --> 00:49:19.018
Qi has become much stronger

660
00:49:20.934 --> 00:49:22.226
You mean, after you coached him

661
00:49:22.393 --> 00:49:23.434
he's much better, right?

662
00:49:23.643 --> 00:49:25.059
No

663
00:49:25.351 --> 00:49:28.684
I mean, the tournament will start soon

664
00:49:28.851 --> 00:49:29.893
He cannot do holds.

665
00:49:30.059 --> 00:49:31.726
He'd really like you to teach him

666
00:49:31.893 --> 00:49:32.851
but dares not ask

667
00:49:33.184 --> 00:49:35.268
I was just being a busybody

668
00:49:36.059 --> 00:49:37.684
Two-time champion,

669
00:49:38.101 --> 00:49:39.059
Fight one round with me

670
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:41.101
If you win, I'll teach him. Okay?

671
00:49:44.226 --> 00:49:45.684
No, no way. Sorry

672
00:49:45.976 --> 00:49:47.226
Didn't you want to help him?

673
00:49:47.393 --> 00:49:48.684
That's right; didn't you?

674
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:51.393
You can do it

675
00:49:54.726 --> 00:49:57.059
Master, are you nervous?

676
00:49:58.559 --> 00:49:59.768
Thanks to you

677
00:50:00.726 --> 00:50:02.518
You're welcome; you can do it

678
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:09.018
If you win, the purse split will change

679
00:50:09.893 --> 00:50:10.643
No problem

680
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:49.268
Are you okay?

681
00:50:51.934 --> 00:50:53.309
Come on, you can do it

682
00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:43.226
Will you teach him?

683
00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:46.018
You fell, too

684
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:47.726
Details

685
00:51:48.184 --> 00:51:51.643
You were like a tank;
let's call it a game

686
00:51:54.268 --> 00:51:56.934
We won! Great!

687
00:51:58.809 --> 00:51:59.518
Hey!

688
00:52:00.268 --> 00:52:00.851
What is it?

689
00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:03.726
Hey, don't touch me

690
00:52:04.226 --> 00:52:05.351
Are you injured?

691
00:52:06.893 --> 00:52:07.518
Dislocated

692
00:52:07.809 --> 00:52:09.809
- Do you need...
- Don't move.


693
00:52:11.351 --> 00:52:12.726
Do you need to go to the hospital?

694
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:21.768
It's habitual

695
00:52:22.893 --> 00:52:23.976
That's it?

696
00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:27.726
Don't freak

697
00:52:28.393 --> 00:52:30.018
You'll get yours

698
00:52:31.226 --> 00:52:32.476
Will you please teach me this move?

699
00:52:33.559 --> 00:52:35.059
Good. Stop. Come

700
00:52:35.226 --> 00:52:37.851
Forward, more...

701
00:52:38.018 --> 00:52:38.559
Good, stop...

702
00:52:38.726 --> 00:52:40.434
1, 2, 3, 4,

703
00:52:40.601 --> 00:52:41.268
Back

704
00:52:41.726 --> 00:52:43.226
Come back

705
00:52:53.559 --> 00:52:54.559
Right

706
00:52:55.559 --> 00:52:58.393
First, the Omaplata

707
00:53:05.643 --> 00:53:07.809
When you are here, put your Chin here

708
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:09.351
Reach with this arm...

709
00:53:13.851 --> 00:53:14.518
Now you've turned a loss into a win.

710
00:53:14.893 --> 00:53:17.393
It's critical that the timing must be perfect

711
00:54:21.809 --> 00:54:23.018
Turn

712
00:54:24.643 --> 00:54:26.643
Why did you only teach
him to come out of holds

713
00:54:27.393 --> 00:54:28.976
Time is short

714
00:54:29.143 --> 00:54:30.893
It's more useful to teach that

715
00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:33.601
I'll teach him holds techniques later

716
00:54:34.018 --> 00:54:36.518
He'll be good at
them with his long limbs

717
00:54:36.851 --> 00:54:38.768
Good. Edwin, take a break.

718
00:54:39.518 --> 00:54:40.476
You train with him

719
00:54:41.684 --> 00:54:42.643
Aren't you teaching him?

720
00:54:43.018 --> 00:54:44.184
I taught.

721
00:54:44.476 --> 00:54:45.809
I didn't say I'd train with him

722
00:54:46.059 --> 00:54:48.018
You do the hard work

723
00:54:48.226 --> 00:54:50.059
I have to train with Edwin. Come!

724
00:54:51.684 --> 00:54:52.351
Master

725
00:54:52.976 --> 00:54:54.518
This is fun. Care to join?

726
00:54:55.893 --> 00:54:57.309
You bring me bad luck

727
00:55:10.726 --> 00:55:11.393
What did you do?

728
00:55:11.559 --> 00:55:12.184
What?

729
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:13.393
You kissed me!

730
00:55:13.559 --> 00:55:14.184
Sorry

731
00:55:24.518 --> 00:55:25.601
You like this kind of thing?

732
00:55:29.351 --> 00:55:30.351
It feels okay

733
00:55:31.059 --> 00:55:31.851
Come on then

734
00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:39.059
When becoming the Ringmaster,

735
00:55:39.226 --> 00:55:41.768
you must knock out your opponent to continue.

736
00:55:42.059 --> 00:55:45.601
Win 10 rounds and
become the champion of this league


737
00:55:45.893 --> 00:55:48.809
and take home $2.7 million dollars!

738
00:55:49.226 --> 00:55:52.601
The champion can also enter the next season.

739
00:55:52.768 --> 00:56:00.601
People, let the Golden Rumble Begin!

740
00:56:17.226 --> 00:56:18.476
Get up

741
00:56:18.643 --> 00:56:20.476
Who do you think will win?

742
00:56:21.101 --> 00:56:25.059
I watched all 3 of
Mike Power's matches in Bangkok

743
00:56:25.268 --> 00:56:26.976
He's a powerhouse; I think he'll win

744
00:56:27.143 --> 00:56:29.809
But local fighter Edwin
Lo has an okay record

745
00:56:30.018 --> 00:56:33.059
He has some experience and is just fair

746
00:56:33.476 --> 00:56:35.351
because I don't think he's stable enough

747
00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:37.976
But in these fights, mental state

748
00:56:38.143 --> 00:56:39.851
is as important as physical

749
00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:55.018
Don't get angry in a match

750
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:57.601
or you'll forget everything

751
00:56:57.934 --> 00:56:59.809
Look, he's all over the place

752
00:57:00.018 --> 00:57:00.809
He's in trouble

753
00:57:19.851 --> 00:57:21.309
Steady, Edwin

754
00:57:21.518 --> 00:57:22.976
Attack again, now!

755
00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.809
He had the upper hand!

756
00:57:47.476 --> 00:57:48.976
Doesn't matter

757
00:57:49.393 --> 00:57:51.809
one punch and you're down

758
00:57:52.059 --> 00:57:54.726
Are you going home with this?

759
00:57:55.101 --> 00:57:56.851
Or will you continue to rumble?

760
00:57:58.434 --> 00:57:59.559
I will continue

761
00:58:00.393 --> 00:58:04.184
Mike has decided to become our first Ringmaster!

762
00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:06.559
So, pick your next challenger

763
00:58:13.018 --> 00:58:15.226
Our next challenger is

764
00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:20.226
Lin Si
-Qi!

765
00:58:37.518 --> 00:58:38.268
What is that?

766
00:58:38.851 --> 00:58:40.976
Sweet potato dessert soup. 
I made it for you

767
00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:43.434
That's too good to be true

768
00:58:44.143 --> 00:58:45.726
What do you want from me?

769
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:47.643
Teach me boxing

770
00:58:48.601 --> 00:58:49.726
How do you know I can?

771
00:58:50.601 --> 00:58:53.268
Sandy says you're a champion

772
00:58:54.768 --> 00:58:55.601
Why do you want to learn?

773
00:58:56.434 --> 00:58:59.268
A fat kid at the
school next door bullies me

774
00:58:59.934 --> 00:59:02.559
He even ran after me yesterday. I'm scared

775
00:59:02.768 --> 00:59:04.768
Shouldn't you tell your teacher?

776
00:59:05.059 --> 00:59:06.226
Yes,

777
00:59:06.393 --> 00:59:08.434
but he still bullies me

778
00:59:10.143 --> 00:59:13.268
I'll teach you some self-defense moves

779
00:59:13.976 --> 00:59:16.434
Always shield your head.

780
00:59:17.018 --> 00:59:19.018
punch him in the gut

781
00:59:19.184 --> 00:59:20.643
When he attacks you

782
00:59:20.976 --> 00:59:22.976
at a good distance,

783
00:59:23.268 --> 00:59:23.684
okay?

784
00:59:23.934 --> 00:59:24.476
Okay

785
00:59:24.976 --> 00:59:28.184
But I don't know if
I can hit my mark

786
00:59:29.101 --> 00:59:30.309
No matter what you do

787
00:59:30.601 --> 00:59:32.768
always tell yourself you can do it

788
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:35.184
You're a champion, of
course you can do it

789
00:59:37.184 --> 00:59:38.351
No,

790
00:59:39.934 --> 00:59:42.726
I'm terrified every time
I get in the ring

791
00:59:43.476 --> 00:59:45.268
But I tell myself,

792
00:59:45.768 --> 00:59:46.809
I can do it

793
00:59:47.226 --> 00:59:47.976
And I do.

794
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:49.601
So have confidence in yourself

795
00:59:50.184 --> 00:59:52.768
Tell yourself loudly, "I can do it!"

796
00:59:53.434 --> 00:59:54.434
Now!

797
00:59:55.059 --> 00:59:56.184
Yes! I can do it!

798
00:59:56.351 --> 00:59:57.476
Louder!

799
00:59:57.643 --> 00:59:59.059
I can do it!

800
00:59:59.226 --> 01:00:01.476
Great! Keep this confidence. Ready?

801
01:00:01.643 --> 01:00:03.684
Fat Kid is coming again!

802
01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:06.018
1, 2, 3!

803
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:07.268
Hey! No!

804
01:00:07.476 --> 01:00:09.309
You horrible girl!

805
01:00:09.476 --> 01:00:10.893
You're tricking me!

806
01:00:13.518 --> 01:00:14.643
1, 2, head down, 1, 2...

807
01:00:17.143 --> 01:00:17.643
1

808
01:00:18.226 --> 01:00:18.851
1, 2

809
01:00:19.559 --> 01:00:20.851
1, 2, head down, 1, 2...

810
01:00:22.684 --> 01:00:23.351
1, 2

811
01:00:31.684 --> 01:00:32.851
The match matters more

812
01:00:33.518 --> 01:00:34.684
to the Ringmaster than to you

813
01:00:35.018 --> 01:00:36.226
Don't go too close

814
01:00:36.976 --> 01:00:38.268
Get a rhythm going

815
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.393
Find a chance to attack, then retract

816
01:00:41.059 --> 01:00:42.351
Remember, in this tournament,

817
01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.726
you win if he

818
01:00:44.018 --> 01:00:46.059
cannot KO you in two rounds

819
01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:51.393
Rest up.

820
01:00:54.559 --> 01:00:57.684
You're young, you can take it

821
01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:00.268
Don't feel rushed.

822
01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:02.101
Get into position, then attack

823
01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:09.351
Remember what you are fighting for

824
01:01:12.851 --> 01:01:13.726
And

825
01:01:14.684 --> 01:01:17.268
don't be afraid.

826
01:01:18.393 --> 01:01:21.059
Once you fear, you lose

827
01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:28.768
Ladies and Gentlemen,
introducing our latest challenger


828
01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:33.309
He stands at 182cm and weighs 70kg

829
01:01:33.518 --> 01:01:36.393
This is his first time
fighting in an MMA League

830
01:01:36.601 --> 01:01:37.559
Please welcome

831
01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:41.101
Lin Si
-Qi

832
01:01:42.768 --> 01:01:43.768
And his opponent

833
01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:49.309
This man stands at
179 cm and weighs 74kg

834
01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:50.434
Last time,

835
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:53.434
he only used one
round to KO his opponent

836
01:01:53.726 --> 01:01:54.976
Our current winner,

837
01:01:55.393 --> 01:01:59.393
Mike Power!

838
01:02:04.976 --> 01:02:08.351
In a backstage interview, 
Mike said he'll

839
01:02:08.518 --> 01:02:11.143
KO Lin Si
-Qi in the first half of Round One

840
01:02:11.476 --> 01:02:14.476
This is Lin's first fight

841
01:02:14.643 --> 01:02:16.143
His physique looks good

842
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:19.143
Without experience, this will
be a lesson for him

843
01:02:19.643 --> 01:02:21.976
But he can win by lasting two rounds

844
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:26.018
10 minutes inside the
ring can be an eternity

845
01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.184
From Lin's footwork, he comes from boxing

846
01:02:53.393 --> 01:02:55.976
He's using guerilla tactics with Mike

847
01:02:56.143 --> 01:02:57.476
It's a clever strategy

848
01:03:36.726 --> 01:03:39.351
A neck lock; if Lin
cannot free himself he'll lose

849
01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.476
Hang in there! 
It will be over soon!

850
01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:23.601
Hang in there!

851
01:04:25.101 --> 01:04:26.101
Stop

852
01:04:32.393 --> 01:04:33.393
Water

853
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:37.018
He got it;

854
01:04:37.184 --> 01:04:38.934
he'll attack you with low kicks now

855
01:04:39.101 --> 01:04:40.934
Don't be afraid, don't avoid him

856
01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:43.059
Keep your distance,

857
01:04:43.268 --> 01:04:44.268
punch him for every kick

858
01:04:44.893 --> 01:04:46.059
You can't avoid his attacks.

859
01:04:46.226 --> 01:04:47.476
Remember

860
01:04:47.643 --> 01:04:49.976
Mike kicked his way through the punch attacks

861
01:04:50.268 --> 01:04:53.018
Next round, Mike will continue his low kicks

862
01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:55.351
Let's see how Lin deals with that

863
01:05:00.101 --> 01:05:02.143
Round Two

864
01:05:02.684 --> 01:05:03.976
Round Two

865
01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:06.143
Ready

866
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:07.143
Ready

867
01:05:07.476 --> 01:05:08.143
Fight!

868
01:05:28.476 --> 01:05:29.851
Hey! Hey!

869
01:05:55.059 --> 01:05:56.643
Stop

870
01:05:57.059 --> 01:05:58.018
Back to your corners

871
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.726
I can still fight

872
01:05:58.893 --> 01:06:01.268
- Doctor!
- I want to fight


873
01:06:02.226 --> 01:06:04.684
Lin looks fine

874
01:06:04.851 --> 01:06:06.726
Will the ref stop the game?

875
01:06:06.976 --> 01:06:08.809
If his wound continues to bleed

876
01:06:08.976 --> 01:06:11.101
Doctor will judge him unfit

877
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:12.601
and the ref will stop it

878
01:06:13.059 --> 01:06:15.226
I hope he's fine; he has great spirit

879
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:20.726
I'm fine

880
01:06:21.059 --> 01:06:23.684
Doctor says he can continue

881
01:06:24.768 --> 01:06:25.726
Ready?

882
01:06:26.268 --> 01:06:27.059
Fight!

883
01:06:54.268 --> 01:06:56.059
Ten more seconds; hang in there!

884
01:07:04.934 --> 01:07:05.934
Stop

885
01:07:15.434 --> 01:07:17.101
Good job

886
01:07:19.351 --> 01:07:20.934
Great! You won!

887
01:07:21.101 --> 01:07:22.101
I won! I won!

888
01:07:22.268 --> 01:07:23.184
I bet against you

889
01:07:23.601 --> 01:07:24.643
I'll bet on you next time

890
01:07:54.768 --> 01:07:55.768
All right

891
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:02.309
A single-yolk mooncake?

892
01:08:02.768 --> 01:08:05.643
The government banned them long ago?

893
01:08:06.476 --> 01:08:09.143
Social Welfare has to
give it to many people

894
01:08:09.643 --> 01:08:10.809
Lucky for the single yolk ones, then

895
01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:19.643
How do you split the yolk?

896
01:08:20.518 --> 01:08:23.143
Rock, paper, scissors! 
The winner picks first

897
01:08:23.643 --> 01:08:25.351
Rock, paper, scissors!

898
01:08:27.809 --> 01:08:29.393
Rock, paper, scissors!

899
01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:30.643
Hurray!

900
01:08:30.809 --> 01:08:31.726
You pick first!

901
01:08:34.018 --> 01:08:35.143
Hurry!

902
01:08:37.143 --> 01:08:38.893
Don't rush me!

903
01:08:41.184 --> 01:08:42.726
All right

904
01:08:42.851 --> 01:08:44.559
Rock, paper, scissors!

905
01:08:47.976 --> 01:08:50.184
My turn, I pick...

906
01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:52.018
Wrong one...

907
01:08:52.184 --> 01:08:52.976
This one

908
01:08:53.518 --> 01:08:55.351
1, 2, 3! Open!

909
01:08:59.559 --> 01:09:01.684
How should we deal with the yolk?

910
01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:03.601
It's ours.

911
01:09:03.934 --> 01:09:06.268
We treated you to the mooncake.

912
01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:08.393
You can have this, too

913
01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:11.893
Dani's Mom, we'll each have one

914
01:09:13.934 --> 01:09:15.559
Have you had a spinning lantern

915
01:09:15.726 --> 01:09:17.059
made from a can?

916
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:18.851
How does it spin?

917
01:09:19.226 --> 01:09:22.101
Like a washing machine; rolling and spinning

918
01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.559
Never! Is it for sale?

919
01:09:24.726 --> 01:09:26.101
No, you have to make it

920
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:27.434
Make me one

921
01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:30.184
Sure, for one mooncake and three breakfasts

922
01:09:30.726 --> 01:09:31.393
It's so expensive

923
01:09:31.559 --> 01:09:33.351
You're not haggling, are you?

924
01:09:33.684 --> 01:09:36.184
Make me one, see
if it's a good deal

925
01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:37.559
All right

926
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:39.976
What do you want?

927
01:09:40.434 --> 01:09:41.434
Out of my way!

928
01:09:42.559 --> 01:09:43.226
Scumbag Fai,

929
01:09:43.393 --> 01:09:44.643
you think I can't find you here?

930
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:46.434
Sorry, gentlemen

931
01:09:46.768 --> 01:09:47.934
This has nothing to do with them

932
01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:49.809
Repay your loan and it will be fine

933
01:09:53.976 --> 01:09:55.226
You owe me money and hurt my men

934
01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:52.518
They heard the sirens and ran off

935
01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:53.851
The knife at the scene,

936
01:10:53.976 --> 01:10:56.976
had someone else's bloodstain
and Gwen's fingerprint


937
01:10:57.643 --> 01:10:59.143
Did you see it happen?

938
01:11:01.143 --> 01:11:04.476
They thought those two were related to me

939
01:11:04.976 --> 01:11:06.143
and beat them

940
01:11:07.643 --> 01:11:10.393
Maybe in the chaos he ran into it

941
01:11:11.643 --> 01:11:13.518
How did the girl fall down the stairs?

942
01:11:16.101 --> 01:11:18.976
Ching Fai, you must stay in Macau

943
01:11:19.518 --> 01:11:21.643
If we need to, we'll contact you.

944
01:11:22.559 --> 01:11:23.309
Gwen Wong

945
01:11:23.893 --> 01:11:26.518
we've notified Social Services

946
01:11:27.018 --> 01:11:28.476
They'll follow up with you

947
01:12:17.393 --> 01:12:20.226
Dani, there's a yolk inside this one

948
01:12:28.893 --> 01:12:30.143
Social Worker Tong,

949
01:12:31.226 --> 01:12:32.434
It's all my fault

950
01:12:33.226 --> 01:12:34.101
That's why

951
01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:37.101
my husband left

952
01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:40.643
and my son died

953
01:12:42.601 --> 01:12:44.434
I was in hospital

954
01:12:45.601 --> 01:12:47.434
and didn't take care of Dani

955
01:12:52.226 --> 01:12:53.726
I'm fine now

956
01:12:54.143 --> 01:12:55.809
Doctor says I've recovered

957
01:12:56.934 --> 01:12:58.268
I can take care of Dani

958
01:12:59.226 --> 01:13:00.768
I am capable of taking care of Dani

959
01:13:02.268 --> 01:13:03.934
I can take care of Dani

960
01:13:14.184 --> 01:13:15.809
Doctor says Dani is fine

961
01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:19.143
She's really fine; don't worry

962
01:13:20.101 --> 01:13:21.143
You're lying

963
01:13:23.559 --> 01:13:24.809
You're a bad guy

964
01:13:25.726 --> 01:13:27.143
I had been in jail

965
01:13:28.143 --> 01:13:29.143
Sorry

966
01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:35.018
I've caused harm to many people

967
01:13:37.976 --> 01:13:40.143
Once you two are okay, 
I will move out

968
01:13:43.434 --> 01:13:46.184
I really am so sorry

969
01:14:49.393 --> 01:14:50.768
Sorry, Sandy

970
01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:52.476
Loan me your bike, it's urgent

971
01:14:53.726 --> 01:14:54.684
Coach Fai

972
01:14:55.101 --> 01:14:56.851
Do you have time for a bite?

973
01:14:57.393 --> 01:14:59.101
It's dawn! I can't eat now!

974
01:14:59.393 --> 01:15:00.434
Hurry, please

975
01:16:13.143 --> 01:16:13.976
Mother!

976
01:16:14.476 --> 01:16:17.184
Are you all right? 
Does your head still hurt?

977
01:16:18.309 --> 01:16:19.976
My head doesn't hurt; I'm fine

978
01:16:26.351 --> 01:16:29.309
Round One is over; let's see

979
01:16:29.476 --> 01:16:31.101
Lin is badly hurt;

980
01:16:31.268 --> 01:16:33.476
will it affect his confidence in Round Two?

981
01:16:33.809 --> 01:16:34.976
That will depend on his coach

982
01:16:35.184 --> 01:16:36.643
What he says

983
01:16:36.809 --> 01:16:39.393
now may turn the situation around

984
01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:42.018
Don't worry, your nose is broken

985
01:16:42.934 --> 01:16:48.143
Master, I can still fight. 
Hurry, help me

986
01:16:49.018 --> 01:16:50.101
Wait

987
01:16:52.309 --> 01:16:55.476
What? Fix it, hurry

988
01:16:55.643 --> 01:16:56.518
Hang in there

989
01:16:59.018 --> 01:17:00.018
This will hurt

990
01:17:09.476 --> 01:17:11.268
Don't let him hit your nose again

991
01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:13.226
You can't fight him up there

992
01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:15.226
He'll bring you to
the ground with a hold

993
01:17:15.684 --> 01:17:18.018
All you can do is
defeat him on the ground

994
01:17:18.559 --> 01:17:19.601
in a battle of holds

995
01:17:20.643 --> 01:17:23.601
You can do it, come on

996
01:17:49.476 --> 01:17:52.268
Why would Lin ground wrestle with Alberto?

997
01:17:53.184 --> 01:17:56.893
Pitting his weakness against Alberto's strength

998
01:18:20.518 --> 01:18:21.226
Harder

999
01:18:27.059 --> 01:18:28.393
Oh, no, he's been tricked!

1000
01:18:29.268 --> 01:18:30.768
Alberto baits his opponents; rookies will be lured

1001
01:18:42.559 --> 01:18:45.434
Other fighters would have surrendered by now

1002
01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:34.434
Once again, Lin Si
-Qi makes a miracle

1003
01:19:34.934 --> 01:19:37.643
I think everyone in the
audience feels like I do

1004
01:19:37.809 --> 01:19:39.518
We all admire his fighting spirit so much

1005
01:19:39.768 --> 01:19:41.518
Today was amazing

1006
01:19:42.184 --> 01:19:44.184
Lin, next time I'll bet on you!

1007
01:19:44.351 --> 01:19:46.018
I mean, support you

1008
01:19:46.684 --> 01:19:47.518
Fantastic!

1009
01:20:26.226 --> 01:20:29.184
If Gwen cannot pass her evaluation

1010
01:20:29.559 --> 01:20:31.059
is there a way

1011
01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:33.434
to keep Dani out of a Home?

1012
01:20:33.809 --> 01:20:35.559
We'll try to contact the father again

1013
01:20:35.768 --> 01:20:37.559
See if he'll take her

1014
01:20:37.851 --> 01:20:40.476
But if, like last
time, we cannot find him

1015
01:20:40.684 --> 01:20:43.643
we'll see if others are
willing to be her guardian

1016
01:20:44.059 --> 01:20:45.934
But both mother and daughter must agree

1017
01:20:46.393 --> 01:20:48.643
I'm a Hong Kong citizen,
can I be her guardian?

1018
01:20:48.809 --> 01:20:49.393
Sure,

1019
01:20:49.559 --> 01:20:52.809
but you must agree to an investigation

1020
01:20:54.393 --> 01:20:55.559
Investigation?

1021
01:21:04.643 --> 01:21:07.101
It's fine; why don't we start over

1022
01:21:24.226 --> 01:21:25.309
Gwen...

1023
01:21:27.059 --> 01:21:28.268
Gwen...

1024
01:21:30.268 --> 01:21:32.101
What business is it of yours?

1025
01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:36.018
Being a guardian is a huge responsibility

1026
01:21:37.268 --> 01:21:38.309
Give me some students

1027
01:21:38.684 --> 01:21:39.934
I want to coach again

1028
01:21:42.268 --> 01:21:43.143
Fai,

1029
01:21:44.143 --> 01:21:45.434
we've been friends over 20 years

1030
01:21:45.976 --> 01:21:47.476
I'll do anything for you

1031
01:21:48.768 --> 01:21:49.893
You think you can just coach?

1032
01:21:50.809 --> 01:21:53.309
That everyone will trust
you just like that kid?

1033
01:22:05.268 --> 01:22:06.934
Qi,

1034
01:22:08.351 --> 01:22:10.559
Get your stuff into the ring

1035
01:22:18.184 --> 01:22:19.684
This evaluation

1036
01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:21.559
shows your emotional control

1037
01:22:21.768 --> 01:22:23.851
is much worse than
when you last left hospital

1038
01:22:24.226 --> 01:22:27.684
The report recommends you
return for treatment soon


1039
01:22:30.268 --> 01:22:33.934
Gwen, for Dani's sake,

1040
01:22:34.518 --> 01:22:35.851
you must calm down

1041
01:22:43.268 --> 01:22:44.684
Miss Social Worker

1042
01:22:45.018 --> 01:22:48.309
Have my investigation results come out yet?

1043
01:22:48.476 --> 01:22:49.601
I'm sorry, Mr Ching

1044
01:22:50.018 --> 01:22:52.434
Because you have a
criminal record in Hong Kong

1045
01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:54.726
we cannot grant you guardianship

1046
01:22:55.393 --> 01:22:57.601
But Dani doesn't have
to go to a Home

1047
01:22:57.893 --> 01:22:59.559
We've found her father,

1048
01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:01.893
who will look after her

1049
01:23:03.184 --> 01:23:04.351
Stop it!

1050
01:23:10.893 --> 01:23:11.934
You're trying to harm me!

1051
01:23:12.518 --> 01:23:15.351
He didn't want us;
don't let him take Dani!

1052
01:23:15.684 --> 01:23:16.684
You're trying to harm me!

1053
01:23:16.851 --> 01:23:19.476
He didn't want us;
don't let him take Dani!

1054
01:23:21.059 --> 01:23:23.976
- No!
- Let go of my hand!


1055
01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:37.184
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
Our Ringmaster,

1056
01:23:37.351 --> 01:23:42.018
Lin Si
-Qi!

1057
01:23:49.393 --> 01:23:51.476
In the last two games,

1058
01:23:51.684 --> 01:23:53.268
you struggled to win

1059
01:23:53.934 --> 01:23:56.809
But somehow, more people are betting on you

1060
01:23:56.976 --> 01:23:59.101
I asked them why

1061
01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:01.726
They said they saw your persistence

1062
01:24:02.101 --> 01:24:04.934
Why do you have this persistence?

1063
01:24:06.601 --> 01:24:08.393
During my training,

1064
01:24:09.268 --> 01:24:11.101
I believe all fighters

1065
01:24:11.268 --> 01:24:12.934
here have a goal, a hope

1066
01:24:14.726 --> 01:24:16.059
I joined this match

1067
01:24:17.143 --> 01:24:18.726
to show one person

1068
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:20.976
what he thinks is impossible

1069
01:24:21.184 --> 01:24:22.809
can be done

1070
01:24:22.976 --> 01:24:24.934
and I hope he can do it, too

1071
01:24:26.393 --> 01:24:28.268
In the match, I may fall

1072
01:24:30.893 --> 01:24:32.393
but I will get up

1073
01:24:34.143 --> 01:24:35.101
Great!

1074
01:24:35.143 --> 01:24:38.226
I hope the person you want

1075
01:24:38.476 --> 01:24:40.143
will see your persistence

1076
01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:44.059
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
Our challenger

1077
01:24:44.268 --> 01:24:48.143
Li Zitian!

1078
01:25:01.851 --> 01:25:04.393
Just look at our challenger Li Zitian

1079
01:25:04.559 --> 01:25:06.809
He's an attacker,

1080
01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:08.434
but kicks are his strength

1081
01:25:08.643 --> 01:25:10.809
Can our Ringmaster take him down?

1082
01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:12.851
We can only wait and see

1083
01:25:41.393 --> 01:25:42.518
Get up

1084
01:26:20.476 --> 01:26:23.018
Lin executed a beautiful Flying Arm Bar

1085
01:26:23.434 --> 01:26:25.809
But Li freed himself before
the hold was in place

1086
01:26:40.768 --> 01:26:42.601
Ringmaster seems unsettled

1087
01:26:43.393 --> 01:26:44.393
Lin has improved

1088
01:26:44.559 --> 01:26:47.101
since his last two games

1089
01:26:47.476 --> 01:26:49.018
but he may lose on power

1090
01:27:24.476 --> 01:27:25.601
Hang in there

1091
01:27:27.934 --> 01:27:28.851
Stop

1092
01:27:32.934 --> 01:27:34.643
Qi seemed disorganized in Round One

1093
01:27:34.976 --> 01:27:36.018
Is something wrong

1094
01:27:36.476 --> 01:27:37.643
with your shoulder?

1095
01:27:38.476 --> 01:27:40.184
Is Master here yet?

1096
01:27:40.893 --> 01:27:43.601
Don't fret. He sees you fear him

1097
01:27:43.893 --> 01:27:46.184
You have the power;
get him on the ground

1098
01:27:46.351 --> 01:27:47.851
and lock him up tight, okay?

1099
01:27:48.309 --> 01:27:49.684
Don't let him anticipate your moves

1100
01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:54.684
How many more patients do I have tonight?

1101
01:27:54.976 --> 01:27:56.018
Let me check

1102
01:27:58.143 --> 01:27:59.893
- Doctor
- Mr Ching


1103
01:28:00.393 --> 01:28:02.351
What is Gwen Wong's situation?

1104
01:28:03.309 --> 01:28:04.643
You don't have to wait for her,

1105
01:28:04.809 --> 01:28:07.434
We're transferring her to
psychiatric rehabilitation now


1106
01:28:10.684 --> 01:28:12.018
You have two more patients

1107
01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:14.684
The patient in Room 5

1108
01:28:14.893 --> 01:28:16.726
must fast for surgery tomorrow

1109
01:28:23.018 --> 01:28:23.643
Steady

1110
01:28:24.351 --> 01:28:24.559
Steady

1111
01:28:24.768 --> 01:28:25.101
Ready

1112
01:28:25.268 --> 01:28:25.559
Ready

1113
01:28:25.726 --> 01:28:26.601
- Beat him
- Fight!


1114
01:28:27.184 --> 01:28:28.184
Get him

1115
01:28:47.351 --> 01:28:49.059
Right; hang in there

1116
01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:16.059
We may have

1117
01:29:16.226 --> 01:29:18.143
a new Ringmaster this time

1118
01:29:18.309 --> 01:29:20.184
From the way this game is looking

1119
01:29:20.351 --> 01:29:23.101
Li may well be Grand Champion

1120
01:30:52.684 --> 01:30:54.976
He's losing; if this goes
on, his arm will break

1121
01:30:55.143 --> 01:30:56.601
Shouldn't he surrender?

1122
01:31:58.601 --> 01:32:00.059
I'm right here

1123
01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:13.434
You must stand up...

1124
01:32:16.476 --> 01:32:17.934
You must stand up...

1125
01:32:21.226 --> 01:32:22.684
You want me to stand up

1126
01:32:23.226 --> 01:32:24.851
I'm already standing up

1127
01:32:28.851 --> 01:32:32.434
Promise me you'll stand up, too...

1128
01:32:34.976 --> 01:32:37.059
You must stand up...

1129
01:32:49.601 --> 01:32:52.434
"Macau Psychiatric Hospital"

1130
01:34:01.393 --> 01:34:04.601
"Indemnification: Injury or Death"

1131
01:34:19.018 --> 01:34:21.393
You're in the ring, don't be afraid

1132
01:34:21.893 --> 01:34:24.726
Once you fear, you lose

1133
01:34:54.934 --> 01:34:56.226
Are you done?

1134
01:34:56.601 --> 01:34:58.226
I don't understand why you fight

1135
01:35:01.268 --> 01:35:02.351
TS

1136
01:35:03.101 --> 01:35:04.768
At our age,

1137
01:35:05.309 --> 01:35:07.101
we don't need others to understand

1138
01:35:07.976 --> 01:35:09.434
Why does Qi fight?

1139
01:35:09.809 --> 01:35:11.101
I told him

1140
01:35:11.934 --> 01:35:13.601
he must remember why he fights

1141
01:35:13.768 --> 01:35:15.309
He's still a kid

1142
01:35:15.434 --> 01:35:17.059
Kids are ignorant

1143
01:35:18.601 --> 01:35:19.934
He didn't lose

1144
01:35:20.893 --> 01:35:22.726
He did what he wanted to do

1145
01:35:23.809 --> 01:35:25.934
Then why do you fight?

1146
01:35:29.393 --> 01:35:31.143
When I was champion,

1147
01:35:32.976 --> 01:35:34.809
I thought the world is mine

1148
01:35:37.768 --> 01:35:39.768
But the world doesn't wait

1149
01:35:41.809 --> 01:35:45.809
All I ended up doing was betraying myself

1150
01:35:47.643 --> 01:35:50.976
I tell you MMA can kill

1151
01:35:52.476 --> 01:35:55.351
I didn't do anything for over 20 years

1152
01:35:57.726 --> 01:35:58.684
I don't want to die

1153
01:35:58.851 --> 01:36:01.393
without any good memories

1154
01:36:02.809 --> 01:36:05.226
I'm worried you'll repeat the kid's mistake

1155
01:36:08.018 --> 01:36:11.143
What do I have to lose?

1156
01:36:11.851 --> 01:36:13.393
Win or lose,

1157
01:36:14.226 --> 01:36:16.184
it can't bring back anything

1158
01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:23.684
I'm like Qi

1159
01:36:26.601 --> 01:36:30.684
We just want to do something for ourselves

1160
01:36:43.643 --> 01:36:46.101
Actually, I'm terrified every time I fight

1161
01:36:47.726 --> 01:36:51.393
But I tell myself, "I can do it"

1162
01:36:51.726 --> 01:36:56.184
"Hello darkness, my old friend"

1163
01:36:56.559 --> 01:37:01.018
"I've come to talk with you again"

1164
01:37:01.726 --> 01:37:06.018
"Because a vision softly creeping"

1165
01:37:06.893 --> 01:37:11.351
"Left its seeds while I was sleeping"

1166
01:37:12.184 --> 01:37:19.309
"And the vision that
was planted in my brain"

1167
01:37:19.726 --> 01:37:28.059
"Still remains. 
Within the sound of silence"

1168
01:37:28.476 --> 01:37:32.268
"In restless dreams I walked alone."

1169
01:37:34.018 --> 01:37:37.601
"Narrow streets of cobblestone"

1170
01:37:38.809 --> 01:37:43.559
"Beneath the halo of a street lamp"

1171
01:37:43.768 --> 01:37:48.476
"I turn my collar
to the cold and damp"

1172
01:37:49.143 --> 01:37:56.184
"When my eyes were stabbed by
the flash of a neon light"


1173
01:37:56.601 --> 01:37:58.601
"That split the night"

1174
01:37:58.893 --> 01:38:00.268
It's sweet potato minced pork porridge

1175
01:38:00.559 --> 01:38:01.601
I haven't made it in a long time

1176
01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:04.184
How does it taste?

1177
01:38:15.434 --> 01:38:16.518
Delicious

1178
01:38:46.976 --> 01:38:50.309
Our first-ever Golden Rumble
had come to an end

1179
01:38:50.518 --> 01:38:54.351
Li Zitian had become our first ever Champion

1180
01:38:54.518 --> 01:38:58.893
Champ, are you going to come back
next season for the challenge?


1181
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:01.643
Why not?

1182
01:39:02.518 --> 01:39:03.226
Okay,

1183
01:39:03.393 --> 01:39:06.768
so pick your next challenger

1184
01:39:11.976 --> 01:39:14.184
The next challenger is

1185
01:39:14.351 --> 01:39:17.976
Ching Fai!

1186
01:39:18.226 --> 01:39:24.184
"No one dared disturb the sound of silence"

1187
01:39:24.684 --> 01:39:28.768
"Fools, said I, "you do not know"

1188
01:39:29.643 --> 01:39:33.893
"Silence like a cancer grows"

1189
01:39:34.851 --> 01:39:39.226
"Hear my words that I might teach you"

1190
01:39:40.018 --> 01:39:44.184
"Take my arms that I might reach you"

1191
01:39:45.143 --> 01:39:52.643
"But my words like silent raindrops fell"

1192
01:39:55.018 --> 01:40:01.851
"And echoed in the wells of silence"

1193
01:40:17.309 --> 01:40:18.476
- Are you alright?
- Is everything okay?


1194
01:40:19.434 --> 01:40:20.559
It's fine...

1195
01:40:33.476 --> 01:40:34.643
Fai

1196
01:40:35.018 --> 01:40:36.976
Fai, he's looking for you

1197
01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:39.393
Are you Ching Fai?

1198
01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.476
I'm Dani's father; I need your help

1199
01:40:43.643 --> 01:40:45.101
Dani won't go with me

1200
01:40:45.976 --> 01:40:47.684
That's normal

1201
01:40:48.268 --> 01:40:50.434
you treated them badly

1202
01:40:51.726 --> 01:40:53.101
I don't want her
to be in a Home

1203
01:40:53.268 --> 01:40:55.351
But you didn't get
Gwen after her first incident

1204
01:40:56.476 --> 01:40:59.309
Mr Ching, I cannot explain that much

1205
01:40:59.809 --> 01:41:01.976
I know Dani doesn't
want to go with me

1206
01:41:02.601 --> 01:41:05.726
When Gwen is released, 
I'll give her back

1207
01:41:05.934 --> 01:41:07.518
I just want to
make up for my mistakes

1208
01:41:08.976 --> 01:41:11.893
Why tell me that? 
I can't help you

1209
01:41:12.143 --> 01:41:14.143
Dani knows you're in a tournament

1210
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:17.643
She said she'll go only after you're done

1211
01:41:18.726 --> 01:41:19.684
She said,

1212
01:41:19.934 --> 01:41:23.101
she can do it only if you can

1213
01:41:54.351 --> 01:41:57.476
The first challenger in Season Two,

1214
01:41:57.643 --> 01:42:00.976
Ching Fai

1215
01:42:03.393 --> 01:42:05.518
It's Grand Champion's first match of Season 2

1216
01:42:05.726 --> 01:42:07.851
He's fighting Lin Si
-Qi's master

1217
01:42:08.184 --> 01:42:09.393
How ironic

1218
01:42:09.643 --> 01:42:10.976
Ching Fai was the

1219
01:42:11.143 --> 01:42:14.393
Golden Belt Boxing Champion of Hong Kong

1220
01:42:14.559 --> 01:42:16.268
in 1988 and 89

1221
01:42:16.518 --> 01:42:19.018
He has plenty of competition experience

1222
01:42:19.226 --> 01:42:21.226
You're talking about 1988

1223
01:42:21.393 --> 01:42:22.726
It may have been a
good year for wine, but

1224
01:42:23.018 --> 01:42:25.184
to a boxer, age and strength

1225
01:42:25.351 --> 01:42:27.393
are his two worst enemies

1226
01:42:27.726 --> 01:42:28.726
We'll see

1227
01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:31.851
if Master can avenge his pupil

1228
01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:39.393
Hurry Sandy, what are you doing?

1229
01:42:39.559 --> 01:42:43.351
- Coming
- Get some wine, your boyfriend is on


1230
01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:46.518
He's so strong; amazing

1231
01:43:03.934 --> 01:43:05.268
Why would he go
in just to be clobbered?

1232
01:43:05.434 --> 01:43:06.768
That's an old Master for you

1233
01:43:06.934 --> 01:43:09.143
He's testing the force of Li's punches

1234
01:43:23.226 --> 01:43:25.268
Ching looks to have the advantage

1235
01:43:25.601 --> 01:43:26.601
But look at Li

1236
01:43:26.768 --> 01:43:27.559
He is so strong

1237
01:43:27.726 --> 01:43:29.434
Punches seem to have no effect on him

1238
01:44:18.643 --> 01:44:21.643
Li has the upper hand; can Ching last?

1239
01:44:21.851 --> 01:44:24.518
Hard to say; Li is draining his strength

1240
01:44:24.684 --> 01:44:25.976
Tactically that's correct;

1241
01:44:26.143 --> 01:44:27.518
don't let him pause

1242
01:44:31.351 --> 01:44:32.309
Protect your head

1243
01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:38.934
Fai

1244
01:44:51.809 --> 01:44:53.143
Saved by the bell!

1245
01:44:53.559 --> 01:44:54.893
Ching is lucky

1246
01:44:55.184 --> 01:44:57.726
He almost suffered the
same fate as his pupil

1247
01:44:57.934 --> 01:45:00.226
Will luck be with him next round?

1248
01:45:00.393 --> 01:45:01.351
Hard to say

1249
01:45:03.684 --> 01:45:05.351
Can you go on?

1250
01:45:05.518 --> 01:45:06.226
Yes

1251
01:45:12.934 --> 01:45:13.726
Be careful

1252
01:45:22.559 --> 01:45:23.393
Ready

1253
01:45:24.059 --> 01:45:24.684
Ready

1254
01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:25.559
Fight!

1255
01:45:44.726 --> 01:45:47.601
Ching has allowed Li
to get his back again

1256
01:45:56.268 --> 01:45:59.226
Ching freed himself because of his stance

1257
01:45:59.518 --> 01:46:01.184
It gave him time to

1258
01:46:01.351 --> 01:46:03.518
solve Li's Head Ram

1259
01:46:37.309 --> 01:46:39.018
A beautiful assault!

1260
01:46:42.434 --> 01:46:44.018
- Harder!
- Get him off!


1261
01:47:35.684 --> 01:47:37.476
Fai! Tap Out!

1262
01:47:53.809 --> 01:47:55.351
How did he turn and make that punch?

1263
01:48:13.934 --> 01:48:15.976
It's truly The Punch that Changed the World

1264
01:48:20.684 --> 01:48:23.018
What an exciting match!

1265
01:48:26.393 --> 01:48:28.393
Can't imagine a 48-year-old boxer

1266
01:48:28.684 --> 01:48:30.351
can beat our Grand Champion

1267
01:48:30.518 --> 01:48:31.351
This proves where there's a will,

1268
01:48:31.518 --> 01:48:34.101
there's a way

1269
01:48:34.601 --> 01:48:35.393
I agree

1270
01:49:16.851 --> 01:49:17.851
You...

1271
01:49:17.976 --> 01:49:19.434
Are you hurt?

1272
01:49:24.018 --> 01:49:25.434
I did it

1273
01:49:26.934 --> 01:49:29.476
so can you, understand?

1274
01:49:36.684 --> 01:49:37.934
Go back to your father

1275
01:49:42.643 --> 01:49:43.518
Don't

1276
01:49:50.309 --> 01:49:51.309
Go

1277
01:49:51.476 --> 01:49:54.976
Scumbag Fai, I'll be back

1278
01:49:55.684 --> 01:49:56.976
Of course

1279
01:49:57.809 --> 01:49:58.851
Go

1280
01:50:07.851 --> 01:50:08.851
Hey

1281
01:50:14.809 --> 01:50:16.184
Come stomp on me

1282
01:50:52.726 --> 01:50:55.018
What is it, Fai?

1283
01:50:55.893 --> 01:50:58.059
I've decided not to return to Hong Kong

1284
01:50:58.934 --> 01:51:00.518
Take this and repay my debts for me

1285
01:51:01.393 --> 01:51:02.393
Repay your debts?

1286
01:51:06.268 --> 01:51:07.559
Did you rob a bank?

1287
01:51:07.851 --> 01:51:10.226
Prize money from MMA

1288
01:51:11.851 --> 01:51:13.393
You only won three games

1289
01:51:13.851 --> 01:51:16.893
I bet on myself
all three games, a trifecta

1290
01:51:17.601 --> 01:51:18.559
Didn't you?

1291
01:51:21.726 --> 01:51:24.268
You bastard, you bet against me?

1292
01:51:25.393 --> 01:51:26.559
Fight again!

1293
01:51:26.934 --> 01:51:29.393
Sure, after you're dead

1294
01:51:29.601 --> 01:51:30.559
I'm serious

1295
01:51:30.726 --> 01:51:32.101
Get to work, serious

1296
01:51:32.268 --> 01:51:33.643
No, Fai

1297
01:51:35.393 --> 01:51:36.559
it will work

1298
01:51:36.768 --> 01:51:37.934
In your dreams

1299
01:51:38.101 --> 01:51:39.268
It works, Fai

1300
01:52:02.101 --> 01:52:03.226
Master

1301
01:52:12.643 --> 01:52:13.976
Yes, Champion?

1302
01:52:14.934 --> 01:52:17.268
There's one move you haven't taught me

1303
01:52:21.476 --> 01:52:22.809
As do you, oh!

1304
01:52:24.309 --> 01:52:27.101
I can't do that

1305
01:52:29.976 --> 01:52:30.934
You did well

1306
01:52:36.101 --> 01:52:38.226
Again, don't kiss me on the mouth

1307
01:52:39.643 --> 01:52:41.476
My kissing skills have improved

1308
01:52:51.143 --> 01:52:52.518
Again?

1309
01:52:53.184 --> 01:52:55.143
I said don't!
