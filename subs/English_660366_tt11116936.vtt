00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.400
When we were children and fed up
with our small neighbourhood -


2
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.680
we used to come to this forest
and wander around.


3
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.440
We didn't know anyone here.

4
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.120
We didn't have to
pretend at all.


5
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.000
If I had done
what others wanted me to do -


6
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.200
I don't know
if I'd still be alive.


7
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.520
Sometimes I think
I don't even know -


8
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.440
who I really am.

9
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.040
You're going to get it...
Just be calm. You're great.


10
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.520
Don't think about winning
or anything.


11
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.760
I feel I just want to
have some fun.


12
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.440
I don't care if I win or lose.

13
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.440
Today I just want to
have a blast.


14
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.400
We've really invested in this.
Big time.


15
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.200
Bitch, we got this!

16
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.720
That's good, that's very good.
I can't even breathe.


17
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.720
Yes, bitch!

18
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.320
In folklore a mermaid
is an aquatic creature -


19
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.880
with the head and
upper body of a human -


20
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.720
and the tail of a fish.

21
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.600
Are you a real mermaid?

22
00:04:14.848 --> 00:04:15.848
DJ B.

23
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.200
This is Ursula's
little sister, bitch!


24
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.000
This is the reason
Ursula became evil!


25
00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.889
I'm beautiful,
I'm beautful damn it.


26
00:05:16.036 --> 00:05:17.036
Alright.

27
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.610
Cheers bitch.

28
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.434
Congratulations.

29
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.160
Cheers to the
motherfucking win, bitch!


30
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.176
Cheers.

31
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.920
This time I didn't care
if I had lost.


32
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.880
I just went there
to enjoy myself.


33
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.977
Me too, exactly.

34
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.640
I didn't stress at all.
- I'm happy.


35
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.880
I just can't wait to take
this shit off.


36
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.120
But I won 'face' anyway...!

37
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.400
You won drag, I won face, bitch.

38
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.120
I made that face.

39
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.880
What the hell is that?
What the fuck...?


40
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.760
He's drunk.
- Don't talk to him.


41
00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:03.312
Fuck!

42
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.520
Fuck you!

43
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.880
We used to say we'll go to
New York when we're 20.


44
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.560
We'll live and work there,
do anything we want.


45
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.520
Now it feels unrealistic.
But this is close enough.


46
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.800
It is good to have dreams.

47
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.400
But maybe it's good to
just let them be dreams.


48
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.280
They gave me this book when
I went to study in New Forest, -


49
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.520
in Bournemouth.

50
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.960
I was there studying biology.
I've never once read this book.


51
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.640
But it looks nice on my shelf.

52
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.520
I'm quite happy to
leave this place.


53
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.200
I've lived here long enough.
So far away from the others.


54
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.120
Before, I never bothered
leaving home.


55
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.760
I lived so far
from the city centre.


56
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.640
I just said 'see you tomorrow'
or 'I'm busy' -


57
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.600
even if I really wasn't.

58
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.680
This was my first dress.

59
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.240
Still fierce.

60
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.280
It was a month or so
after I had left home.


61
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.880
I saw this and I bought it.

62
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.760
I was afraid that someone would
see me and tell my family.


63
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.080
My mother bought me this shirt.

64
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.760
I'll never wear it. But I'll
always have it in my closet.


65
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.000
I've always said
Kelet's fabulous.


66
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.680
She's tall, she has a long neck
and nice cheekbones.


67
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.640
Such a beautiful face.
And long legs.


68
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.400
Every girl's dream.

69
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.560
Kelet is so beautiful.

70
00:09:17.952 --> 00:09:18.952
She's beautiful.

71
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.840
Even if she doesn't know it.
Or do you?


72
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.240
I don't know anything.

73
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.920
She's beautiful.

74
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.760
She's brave.
I love that.


75
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.440
Are you trying to kill me?
- Yes, I am.


76
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.720
But if you die now, at least
you'll die looking fabulous.


77
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.080
If someone had asked me
two or three years ago -


78
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.160
I would never have said
'I'm a trans woman.'


79
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.320
I would never have said
I live alone.


80
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.240
That I don't talk to my parents.

81
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.960
My family lives in Manchester.

82
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.480
We moved there eight years ago.

83
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.600
I guess we just needed
a change of scenery.


84
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.320
All I know, I hated it.
Every second.


85
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.560
Are you serious?
You're going like that?


86
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.240
You're going to wear that
all night?


87
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.960
Are you serious?
Can you even breathe?


88
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.000
They'll scream your name
and you'll have to vogue.


89
00:10:50.809 --> 00:10:52.285
Oh my god, girl.

90
00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:12.002
We were called f******.
We were called n******


91
00:11:12.057 --> 00:11:14.817
We didn't belong. So
we created our own world.


92
00:11:15.127 --> 00:11:16.394
With our own rules.

93
00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:19.080
And you know what happened?
Magic.


94
00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:22.965
And now with us, with Vogue.

95
00:11:23.005 --> 00:11:27.605
The iconic Mother Leiomy Amazon!

96
00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:40.175
She is here, DJ Tarp.

97
00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:08.880
The cover of Vogue, bitch.

98
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.720
I have always wanted to be
a runway model.


99
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.040
That's my biggest dream.

100
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.400
I used to watch Iman and
Naomi Campbell videos, -


101
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.720
and I thought
'Oh my God, what a life!'


102
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.840
Watching those
women kept me alive.


103
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.360
I thought it was my only way up.

104
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.040
I've applied to model agencies.

105
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.000
But they say they have
enough Black models.


106
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.600
But thanks for your interest.

107
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.320
When I first told my parents
who I am, -


108
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.920
they told me
I'll never make it, -


109
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.040
because I'm a freak.

110
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.480
No one will accept me.

111
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.880
They organised a meeting
where my aunt, grandmother, -


112
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.240
my uncle and my parents -

113
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.840
took me into a room.

114
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.800
And one by one everyone said -

115
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.280
if you choose
to follow that road, -


116
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.640
we won't talk to you,
we won't look at you.


117
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.120
We won't feed you
if you're hungry.


118
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.800
Unless my father
contacts me first, -


119
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.920
I won't do anything.
I don't care.


120
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.247
It should be the
other way round.


121
00:14:45.272 --> 00:14:46.984
What do you mean?

122
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.600
It will fall.

123
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.320
You see?
- Yeah.


124
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.400
It's the other way around.

125
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.920
Suddenly I'm your handyman.

126
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.720
I don't like this at all.

127
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.320
Shouldn't it be
like the other one?


128
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.320
I'll fix it.

129
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.320
Now it's done.

130
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.480
Well, it's your TV,
you deal with it.


131
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.040
Let's just give up, all right?
Maybe a drink will help.


132
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.760
Pour it in a classy way,
will you?


133
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.880
After that,
I need an extra big glass.


134
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.040
Nice.

135
00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:06.529
Cheers.

136
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.120
Do you know how cold
it is outside?


137
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.000
No, and I don't care.

138
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.720
Turn it off! Oh my God!

139
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.080
There goes the hair dryer...

140
00:17:04.487 --> 00:17:06.753
- Oh my god.
- Oh my fucking god.


141
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.160
We have to figure out something.

142
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.400
Oh my god.

143
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.480
How did it manage to
suck in all this?


144
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.640
Yeah, just in seconds.

145
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.040
And you won't put on
any make up? Oh, wow.


146
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.800
These are good.
- Beautiful!


147
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.962
And some of these.

148
00:17:35.987 --> 00:17:38.864
I'll tell you, what
they wrote me.


149
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.160
I'd like to present you
to these agencies, -


150
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.640
but first I'd like to ask
for your permission -


151
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.160
to show them
your Instagram photos.


152
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.240
Okay... I don't know...

153
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.160
Why would they do that...

154
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.120
In some countries,
maybe it could work...


155
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.120
But in Finland...

156
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.800
Yeah. A Black trans woman.

157
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.120
It's a big deal.

158
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.800
If I get gigs and
there is a make-up artist...


159
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.480
Imagine the make-up
I would have...


160
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.840
Do you remember,
when I told you about my school?


161
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.240
The only time we learned -

162
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.560
to do make-up
for a Black person -


163
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.080
was the time
when we created characters.


164
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.120
You mean, you made
white people look Black?


165
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.040
Girl...

166
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.840
If I get a chance, I think
I'll do a few things here -


167
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.760
and then I'll go and work
in Paris or somewhere.


168
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.960
I'll try to get out of here.

169
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.840
Though, it would be good to
have someone here, in Finland.


170
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.440
That's how it is...

171
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.695
Dinner's ready!

172
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.040
Do you want some? 
- Okay.

173
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.120
You're about to become a model,
so that's all you'll get.


174
00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:09.255
Diet food.

175
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.160
I'll get my hormone pills.

176
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.440
Do you take them
at a certain hour -


177
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.520
or when you have time?

178
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.280
I should take them every morning.

179
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.080
What?

180
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.280
Well, you just have to
take them with food.


181
00:19:47.981 --> 00:19:48.981
Ah, ok.

182
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.880
Here in Helsinki, there are
many places we have to avoid.


183
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.280
For our own safety.

184
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.480
They shout at you
or they threaten you.


185
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.120
We really have to pay attention
to where we go.


186
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.760
And where we have our shows.

187
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.400
Vogue is a dance style
born many decades ago -


188
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.600
in the New York ballroom scene.

189
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.560
Rainbow and LGBT people and
people of colour came together -


190
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.160
in situations like the one
I had to face -


191
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.120
when their families found out
about their sexuality -


192
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.840
and didn't want them anymore.

193
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.720
Now the totem...
Five, six, seven, eight.


194
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.240
One, two, three, four.
- Wait a second.


195
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.920
I wonder why I'm doing this!

196
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.880
Kelet and Lola, how about
moving your arms like this?


197
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.400
So that they don't open too much.
Otherwise, they'll be like this!


198
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.280
Five, six, seven, eight. One...

199
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.960
Kelet, wrong foot.
- It starts with left?


200
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.840
Left comes on two.

201
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.320
You've been doing this.

202
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.440
Don't start on one.

203
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.320
You're starting too early.

204
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.360
But you should
do it like this.


205
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.240
I don't know who I would be
if I hadn't gone down this road.


206
00:22:18.321 --> 00:22:20.388
I don't want to think about it.

207
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.000
I was a quiet and shy kid.
I was afraid of everything.


208
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.360
Sometimes I didn't even have
the courage to go to school.


209
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.200
My mother taught me a lot.

210
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.000
But I've noticed that
the mentors and 'the mothers' -


211
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.440
help you navigate through life.

212
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.240
One teaches you how to pay bills.

213
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.720
And another how to do make-up.

214
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.000
They teach you
all kinds of things.


215
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.441
I know I'll screw
this up, but...


216
00:22:57.466 --> 00:22:58.824
Don't say that.

217
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.600
You'll be prepared and
you won't screw up.


218
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.760
I have to say, this thing is
way better than anything -


219
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.600
that's happening
in the Finnish drag scene.


220
00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:14.575
No shade towards anyone.

221
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.840
No one in Finland does it
the way we do.


222
00:23:19.134 --> 00:23:20.134
Girl.

223
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.760
Think if our wigs
come off on stage!


224
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.920
It makes you feel
like you have a family.


225
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.320
That you are safe.

226
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.560
Look up.

227
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.760
Today we'll be making history.

228
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.680
This will be
the first POC queer party -


229
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.000
in the history of Helsinki Pride.

230
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.120
The first where the organisers
are brown and people of colour.


231
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.240
And the target audience
is brown and people of colour.


232
00:23:53.708 --> 00:23:56.108
In the spirit of
"Paris is Burning."


233
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.320
When you belong to a minority, -

234
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.680
you'd think other minorities
would support you.


235
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.480
That they would get you.

236
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.040
But that's not how it is.
- No, not in here.


237
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.080
Then there's Vogue
and other things, -


238
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.320
which were born
within Black culture...


239
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.760
I think the Finnish Vogue scene
is much better now.


240
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.000
When I first came here,
it was very small.


241
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.240
Now people are interested in it.

242
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.160
Ofimja was here before me.

243
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.640
In the times of
Field Marshal Mannerheim.


244
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.280
World War II!

245
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.120
Me, Lola and Kelet are the only
trans women in this scene.


246
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.000
Kelet, Lola and Roza are
the only POCs.


247
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.960
You mean foreigners?
- People of colour.


248
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.720
The scene is very homogeneous.

249
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.120
Mostly white, cis-gendered
heterosexual women.


250
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.120
And they're mostly learning it, -

251
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.000
as if Vogue was like
any other dance you can learn.


252
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.720
If it is empowering for
some women, that's great.


253
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.520
But if you know the background -

254
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.520
and what it means
to this community -


255
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.280
then it's different,
it's a bitter-sweet feeling.


256
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.360
We are under-represented.

257
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.720
For example,
you can't do some moves -


258
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.800
if you have an Adam's apple.

259
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.960
You can't do this,
because it means -


260
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.160
you don't have it anymore.

261
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.215
Bitch, I'm gonna be hungover,
but I'm gonna get..


262
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.520
No, I don't want to
drink too much tonight.


263
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.320
Tomorrow's the Pride parade.

264
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.600
I need to be able to walk.

265
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.840
Don't start!
- Oh, I'm starting?


266
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Have you ever seen me start?

267
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.720
What are you talking about?

268
00:26:09.235 --> 00:26:10.235
Oh, please.

269
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.280
It goes like this.

270
00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:14.176
So darling.

271
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.800
Oh my God, you look fabulous.

272
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.200
What's this,
you have pimples...


273
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.280
You always say
something like that.


274
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.040
It wasn't about pimples.

275
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.320
It was about facts.
I said to you, -


276
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.440
you look fabulous,
but your eyebrows are bushy.


277
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.600
Your eyebrows were
fucking lion-queen bushy.


278
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.160
Like this, you know.

279
00:26:42.313 --> 00:26:44.393
You need to be
snatched to capacity.


280
00:26:44.454 --> 00:26:46.016
It's just the way it
is, darling, honey.


281
00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:48.704
Shade is training, bitch.

282
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.920
But that's life, darling.

283
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.160
Oh my God, these curls!
-Is it good or bad?


284
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.720
There are no straight ones left?
- No...


285
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.920
Let's try to find
some other colour.


286
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.360
Kelet's brave. 
Kelet's beautiful.

287
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.000
Kelet's patient. 
Kelet's smart.

288
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.630
Okay.

289
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.720
Does this look all right?
- You look gorgeous.


290
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.958
Kelet! Kelet!

291
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.360
Love belongs to everybody!

292
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.480
I was thirteen when I attended
my first Pride parade.


293
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.680
My dearest memory is marching
together with my brother.


294
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.840
It was the moment
when we were like -


295
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.880
'Are we walking in front of
all these people?'


296
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.480
I miss my siblings,
especially my brother Max.


297
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.840
When the family thing happened,
it was him who consoled me -


298
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.720
and got me back on my feet.

299
00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.360
I felt I didn't belong anywhere.
I was all by myself in the world.


300
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:07.520
Pride is also my celebration.
I have created my own space.


301
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.200
I used to watch this video -

302
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.680
when I was preparing
for Vogue balls.


303
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.800
Her walk is so well composed.

304
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.240
There's something very
captivating about her walk.


305
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.920
She's just so wonderful.

306
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.200
This is Tiina from the
employment agency. - Hi.


307
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.360
Are you available for
shifts this week?


308
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.640
My week's all empty.

309
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.920
Except tomorrow and
on Thursday I'm busy.


310
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.680
So, you can't come tomorrow
and on Thursday.


311
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.120
And you'll have the shift
on Wednesday.


312
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.280
There are more shifts
available for next weekend.


313
00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:34.520
So you can reserve
your shifts online


314
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.520
if you're available.

315
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.880
Okay. I will.
- Thank you. Bye!


316
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
At some point,
I'd like to study more.


317
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.720
I could continue
studying biology.


318
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.320
I didn't quit it because
I didn't like it.


319
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:07.040
It was just... I was nineteen,
I had just left home.


320
00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:15.200
I had no money, no savings.
I was all alone.


321
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.920
Even if I had a job, -

322
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.440
that wasn't enough.

323
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.160
They paid me like

324
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.000
I haven't heard yet
from the agencies.


325
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.080
They never say anything.
No idea, what they are thinking.


326
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.080
I'll ask her right away.
'Hi, any news?'


327
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.200
It's very frustrating to just
wait and wait -


328
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.800
for months on end.

329
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.720
Sometimes I just don't have
the energy for this.


330
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.200
I went to job interviews.

331
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.920
I wasn't trying to hide myself.
It went all right.


332
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.200
But then they asked for my ID.

333
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.280
And they saw it said male. The
atmosphere changed right away.


334
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.040
The interview stopped at once.
I didn't get the job.


335
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.160
Is this just
a waste of time and energy?


336
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.000
They always have those nice
pink backdrops. - Yeah.


337
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.560
At first, I thought she wanted to
take similar photos with me.


338
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.560
Straight hair and everything.
- Okay. But are you comfortable?


339
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.040
Yeah. With the black top.
- Girl, that's you soon.


340
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.560
Imagine that.

341
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.120
Lovely studio!

342
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.920
When we got your message -

343
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.000
Lola and I were all excited.

344
00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:35.033
Oh my god.

345
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.000
She wants you to be glass.

346
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.760
I'm turning into... a doll.

347
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.480
Put your hand like...
That's perfect.


348
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.680
And turn your face a bit...
That's it.


349
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.280
It would be a lie to say -

350
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.560
I've always loved the
colour of my skin.


351
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.000
I don't like myself in pictures.

352
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.280
People ask me,
why do you want to be a model -


353
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.920
if you don't like to look
at yourself in pictures.


354
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.280
I was in contact about
changing my name.


355
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.960
That will cost you 25 euros.

356
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.840
Why exactly do you want this
particular first name?


357
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.840
This is not a registered name
in Finland.


358
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.280
That's why we need
additional information.


359
00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.160
Okay.

360
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:43.440
Is the name common in the country
where you have family ties?


361
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.560
What does your name mean
in Finnish?


362
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.000
Well, mine's not a common name...

363
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.240
I'll just make something up.

364
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.000
'Kelet is
a Somali name that means'


365
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.240
What could it be?

366
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.720
Well, it's unique,
to say the least.


367
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.960
I've never met
anyone called Kelet.


368
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:36.000
The process is now underway.
- Excuse me?


369
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.360
The process is now underway.
- All right.


370
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.800
You'll let me know then.
- Yes.


371
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.600
I can't even remember
what they look like.


372
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.440
I've changed so much.
That's obvious.


373
00:39:19.122 --> 00:39:20.520
Please have your boarding card

374
00:39:20.545 --> 00:39:23.386
and open passport
ready for inspection.


375
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.840
Say hello to my brother.

376
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.680
It's weird to see each other
after three years, -


377
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.040
and to see where we are now.

378
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.920
I'm so happy you're here now.

379
00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.680
Honestly.

380
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.880
We've literally switched roles.

381
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.200
Why couldn't I
just get the coochie?


382
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.800
What was I saying?

383
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.320
Then we both came out -

384
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.800
and we just got so much closer,
didn't we?


385
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:24.240
I came out to you. And you were
like 'Oh my goodness', -


386
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.840
this whole fucking family
is full of queers.


387
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.760
And I was like 'what'?
'What do you mean?'


388
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.400
Normally you have
a gay sister or a brother.


389
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.680
But when one is trans
and the other is also trans...


390
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.560
That's quite ... random.

391
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.600
We're going through
the same thing.


392
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.480
Because we can talk about this
without feeling awkward.


393
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.160
A couple of months from now,
we're going to look like...


394
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.320
I just started a month ago.
- Really?


395
00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.360
Me, eight months.

396
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.280
Three days ago I had my one-
month anniversary with hormones.


397
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.520
When I came to Finland,
it helped me that I had people -


398
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.160
with whom I could talk.
- It makes the difference.


399
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.200
In Bournemouth I was all alone.

400
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.200
Yeah, and even if
you're not alone, -


401
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.720
physically you're still alone.

402
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.480
And when I came here,
I had you.


403
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:32.360
And when I needed some space,
I could go someplace else.


404
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.040
But I was afraid I would run
into someone from my family, -


405
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.840
my mother, my sisters...

406
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.520
I remember, you were
a bit... withdrawn.


407
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.160
Your spirits were quite low.

408
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.200
But I can see the difference now
and I'm so proud of you now.


409
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.240
And it makes me happy.

410
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.320
You're so tall.
- I have to crouch...


411
00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.520
This place has been
a life saver for me.


412
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.520
When I had
self-destructive thoughts -


413
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.320
I would come here.
This place comforted me.


414
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.160
Until now, a trend in my life
has been that -


415
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.520
things begin fairly well.

416
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.720
I have friends who are with me
and who love me.


417
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.200
But after a while,
I somehow end up all alone.


418
00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:04.800
I push people away because
I don't want them to leave me.


419
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.840
I prefer to keep others
at a distance.


420
00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.160
To keep me from getting hurt.

421
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.200
My father said that
he wants to meet me.


422
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.440
I'll go see him today.

423
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.240
He'll probably expect
a different kind of shirt.


424
00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.040
Because he told me to
put on a button shirt.


425
00:44:50.204 --> 00:44:53.404
These are the only type
of shirts that I have.


426
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.520
He said don't wear a dress.

427
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.423
And I said of
course, no problem,


428
00:44:57.448 --> 00:44:58.984
I'm sure leggings will be ok?

429
00:44:59.008 --> 00:45:00.008
Yeah of course.

430
00:45:03.383 --> 00:45:04.960
Honey, we gotta start somewhere.

431
00:45:04.985 --> 00:45:07.007
We got to start somewhere.

432
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.080
As he said yesterday -

433
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.240
sometimes you just have to force
yourself into situations -


434
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.080
and start talking.

435
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.560
This is not too over the top.

436
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.600
Fabulous glam.

437
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.040
This is a humble outfit.

438
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.080
We'll see
how this is going to turn out.


439
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.240
I'll see my siblings again.
With them everything is fine.


440
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.000
But when it comes to my dad,
I think he just needs time.


441
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.920
He needs to accept all this.

442
00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.280
He needs to face the truth.

443
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.520
Everyone is suffering
and missing each other.


444
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.920
Anyway, I don't want to
get my hopes up too much.


445
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.680
I'll just be disappointed.

446
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:40.480
When my dad finally arrived,
we looked each other in the eye.


447
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.926
There was a mutual
understanding,


448
00:46:42.951 --> 00:46:45.104
like 'it's been a while'...

449
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.640
I had make-up and
I was wearing the clothes.


450
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.440
He noticed them.
But he didn't say anything.


451
00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.240
Then we had lunch.

452
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.840
And even if it was
only a chicken burger, -


453
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.760
the fact that he paid for it -

454
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.560
it felt like he was
welcoming me back.


455
00:47:20.403 --> 00:47:21.403
Yeah, Kelet.

456
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.080
You look so happy!
- Do I?


457
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.000
It went well.
He just called me two hours ago.


458
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.800
He said to me...

459
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.800
He said he wishes me
a safe trip back.


460
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.320
I hope everything goes well.

461
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.640
Imagine...

462
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:46.240
As I've said before, he just
has to get used to the idea -


463
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.880
that you are what you are.

464
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.080
It might take a year or two.

465
00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.240
With time he'll understand
that this is who you are.


466
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.280
And the love will follow.

467
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.600
I'm happy for you.
You went and met your parents.


468
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.360
I haven't even seen my parents
in a long time.


469
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.680
I'm so happy that you met them!

470
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.280
You went to the same places
where you were hopeless before.


471
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.400
Now you have some responses
and you can continue your life.


472
00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.480
Now the things are
falling into place.


473
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.880
I think they're starting to
fall into place.


474
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.720
Do you remember
when two years ago -


475
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.080
you called me from Manchester -

476
00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.440
and you were crying.

477
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.520
You were feeling desperate.

478
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.280
You said, 'Lola,
I don't know what to do.'


479
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:50.600
'I'm in a bad place.
I'm homeless.'


480
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.480
'How did my life
turn out to be like this?'


481
00:48:54.548 --> 00:48:57.348
Two different girls,
two different girls.


482
00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.520
I have to admit,
two days without you was fine, -


483
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.960
but now I really
need you, bitch.


484
00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.160
Me too,
I've been like -


485
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.320
where's Lola?

486
00:49:08.333 --> 00:49:09.533
I need that bitch.

487
00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:12.316
I need her.

488
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.504
You've become
my baby little girl,


489
00:49:14.529 --> 00:49:15.771
I love...
- Oh my god.


490
00:49:16.131 --> 00:49:18.440
Well sometimes we need
a break but sometimes,


491
00:49:18.465 --> 00:49:19.483
some days I feel like...

492
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.640
Sometimes we need some distance.

493
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.440
But I think
we've been sewn together.


494
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.680
Two weeks without you
is too long!


495
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.400
But don't forget us
when you are rich.


496
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.880
Like you'd leave me alone!

497
00:49:33.926 --> 00:49:36.746
- Girl...
- Okay, I love you so much.


498
00:49:36.801 --> 00:49:37.801
I love you too.

499
00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.320
This is really happening.

500
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.520
I got my first gig as a runway
model at Helsinki Fashion Week.


501
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.400
Kelet? Are you Kelet?
Sorry for my Finnish.


502
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.720
How are you today?
I'm really good, thank you.


503
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.040
So, if you could
try on your first look.


504
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.320
Your first look is
basically just a dress.


505
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.000
So this is
a little bit see-through, -


506
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.520
are you ok to show
your nipples? - No.


507
00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:44.280
Otherwise, do you
have underwear?


508
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.280
Yeah, is that ok?
- Yeah that's fine!


509
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.040
Don't do this.

510
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.560
May I ask, what is that?
I've never used anything red.


511
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.680
It's just a blusher.
It brightens up your face.


512
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:28.080
It gives some colour and
adds a bit of dimension.


513
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:08.400
Autumn brought me
a longing heart, -


514
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:17.040
a wonderful feeling of joy.

515
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:26.280
My girl, I gave you
the most beautiful roses -


516
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:33.120
as a memory of our love.

517
00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:39.280
But I didn't know that
even the flowers of love -


518
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.280
disappear underneath the ice -

519
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.280
when autumn freezes the ground.

520
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.280
I can only watch in tears.

521
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.200
I'm so nervous.

522
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.960
We've spread
the information around.


523
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.400
We told it to the
best gossipers in town.


524
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.040
Kelet, that's mine!

525
00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.640
You already have too much.

526
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.840
Okay. See you soon.

527
00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.360
I have to sort these out.

528
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.320
This is starting to look OK.

529
00:54:12.477 --> 00:54:14.957
I love you, I love you,
I love you.


530
00:54:14.977 --> 00:54:16.844
- I love you.
- I love you.


531
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.461
- Alright.
- Let's do it.


532
00:54:20.797 --> 00:54:25.922
They are like the fiercest,
the sexiest, the coolest...


533
00:54:26.047 --> 00:54:28.287
House of Miss Rocky...

534
00:55:14.874 --> 00:55:17.093
I am the face queen
of Finland, honey.


535
00:55:29.631 --> 00:55:31.388
Hey beautiful.

536
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.680
My chosen family makes
my world feel different, -


537
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.320
like my voice matters.

538
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.600
Be whatever you
want to be, honey.


539
00:56:52.062 --> 00:56:53.890
Shade is training bitch.

540
00:57:28.653 --> 00:57:31.319
I am the face queen
of Finland, honey.
