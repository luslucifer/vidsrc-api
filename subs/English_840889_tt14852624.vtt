1
00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:51.842
- Yes.

2
00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:05.488
-Gently.

3
00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:11.195
Tilt it slowly.

4
00:03:23.374 --> 00:03:26.377
-Little.

5
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.678
Take the frame.

6
00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:40.324
Same direction?

7
00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:41.491
Yes.

8
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.429
Ease it.

9
00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:47.331
Not too much.

10
00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:52.702
Little.

11
00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:58.508
Yes.

12
00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:17.995
-It's not working.

13
00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.099
We need to do it again.

14
00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:31.842
A bit smaller, poppet.
-Okay.


15
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.054
-Maybe...

16
00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:46.623
Maybe I can help you come up
with some ideas.


17
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.941
-Sit.

18
00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:48.853
So, tell me about your idea.

19
00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.894
-Well, uh...

20
00:06:46.243 --> 00:06:47.710
-Yeah, because you work
with your dad,


21
00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:49.746
working for dad.
-Yeah. I want to finish my home.


22
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.815
-Yeah, we haven't worked
on it for 10 years.


23
00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:52.950
-Yeah, I'm always developing,

24
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.518
and I'm trying anything,
ya know.


25
00:06:54.652 --> 00:06:56.086
-Yeah.
-But I do get paid


26
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.922
to produce music.

27
00:06:58.055 --> 00:07:02.226
Hey. She emerges
from her cave.


28
00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:04.694
-Ella, look at you.

29
00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:07.764
So, this is one
that we did last year.


30
00:07:07.898 --> 00:07:09.766
The client was a bitch.

31
00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:13.103
-Is this new stuff?

32
00:07:13.237 --> 00:07:15.372
-Uh, well, this one's new,

33
00:07:15.506 --> 00:07:17.942
and this one's new.

34
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:25.316
-Oh, wow, it's really good.
-Oh. Thanks, babe.


35
00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:26.817
-You want a drink?

36
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:28.819
-Um. I'm okay. Thanks.

37
00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:06.290
What are you...?

38
00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:08.225
What are you doing?

39
00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:10.027
-I need to go.

40
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.929
Playtime is over.

41
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:18.869
-Come on. I need to get back
before she wakes up.


42
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.243
I feel so used right now.

43
00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:30.681
No, no, no.

44
00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:32.316
-No, stay.

45
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:34.852
-Get off me.
I've got work to do.


46
00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:37.021
-No, you haven't.

47
00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:47.097
-When you think you'll finish
this film of yours?


48
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:50.801
-It's not my film.
It's my mom's.


49
00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:54.271
-She's a legend. That's true.

50
00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:03.847
-Her hands are getting worse.

51
00:09:06.517 --> 00:09:08.452
I promised I'd help her
finish this last film.


52
00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:14.024
So, she's the brains,
and I'm the hands.


53
00:09:14.158 --> 00:09:16.894
That's the way it is.

54
00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:19.730
-You don't want to make
your own films?


55
00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:22.199
Find your own voice, ya know?

56
00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:26.503
-I don't have my own voice.

57
00:09:58.936 --> 00:10:01.238
- Poppet!

58
00:10:01.372 --> 00:10:02.172
Poppet!

59
00:10:02.306 --> 00:10:04.708
Wake up, poppet!

60
00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:06.710
Time to work.

61
00:10:57.995 --> 00:11:00.731
Are you tired, poppet?

62
00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:04.435
Are you a little bit grumpy
this morning?


63
00:11:04.568 --> 00:11:06.603
-No, I'm fine.

64
00:11:06.737 --> 00:11:10.541
-All I want is
to finish this film...


65
00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:12.576
before I die.

66
00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:17.481
Is it such a burden?

67
00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:19.383
Left 2 millimeters.

68
00:11:19.516 --> 00:11:22.887
-What?
-Head left 2 millimeters.


69
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.156
Head left 2 millimeters!

70
00:11:30.294 --> 00:11:32.529
Take the frame.

71
00:11:36.266 --> 00:11:40.170
Left, half a millimeter.

72
00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:42.606
What is wrong with you?

73
00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:46.610
Half a millimet...

74
00:11:46.743 --> 00:11:49.046
millimeter.

75
00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:54.651
Leave it.

76
00:11:54.786 --> 00:11:56.821
Back to where you were.

77
00:11:56.955 --> 00:11:59.356
Put your hands on the puppet.

78
00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:02.626
Leave it there.

79
00:12:04.761 --> 00:12:07.030
Don't you dare move!

80
00:12:09.968 --> 00:12:13.437
Don't move a muscle.

81
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.475
Don't blink.

82
00:12:20.812 --> 00:12:23.714
Don't you dare...

83
00:12:23.848 --> 00:12:25.549
move!

84
00:12:25.682 --> 00:12:30.721
Don't move a muscle!

85
00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:36.560
-Mom.

86
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.731
Mum.

87
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.171
Mom.

88
00:12:48.305 --> 00:12:51.009
Don't move.

89
00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:53.744
Mom.

90
00:12:57.047 --> 00:12:59.316
- Well, she's not
responding to any stimuli.


91
00:12:59.449 --> 00:13:02.987
We'll take her to ICU,
and have her for a CT scan.


92
00:13:03.754 --> 00:13:06.189
She's in a coma.

93
00:13:06.323 --> 00:13:08.559
Has she had
a stroke in the past?


94
00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:13.263
Ella, has your
mother had a stroke in the past?


95
00:13:14.298 --> 00:13:18.402
-She has arthritis
in her hands, and, uh...


96
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.673
She doesn't look real.

97
00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:16.393
-Ella.

98
00:14:17.028 --> 00:14:20.064
Look, you can stay here
as long as you like. Okay?


99
00:14:20.197 --> 00:14:23.001
You shouldn't go back
to that place.


100
00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.601
Ella.

101
00:14:36.246 --> 00:14:38.682
Ella, you okay?

102
00:14:41.318 --> 00:14:43.453
-I need to finish it.

103
00:14:52.997 --> 00:14:55.133
-This is it.

104
00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:56.968
Most people have moved out now.

105
00:14:57.101 --> 00:15:01.672
We're gutting the place, so it's
going to be empty for a while.


106
00:15:14.685 --> 00:15:16.821
They're all the same.
-Sh.


107
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:26.229
Can I see this one?

108
00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:31.869
-I mean, it's
a pretty good studio.


109
00:15:56.493 --> 00:15:58.428
I'd only hope for you
to use this as a space.


110
00:15:58.562 --> 00:15:59.997
You can come back
to mine at night.


111
00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:01.933
-Tom.

112
00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:07.571
-All right. Well.

113
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.942
I'll stay with you, then.

114
00:16:11.075 --> 00:16:12.743
-You'll distract me.

115
00:16:12.877 --> 00:16:15.679
-No, I won't.

116
00:16:15.813 --> 00:16:16.781
-I have to work.

117
00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:20.250
I'm not stopping you.

118
00:16:20.383 --> 00:16:22.352
-All right.

119
00:16:30.527 --> 00:16:33.965
Uh, so,
I'll see you later, then?


120
00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:37.001
Bring you some dinner.

121
00:16:37.135 --> 00:16:38.903
I'm looking after you now.

122
00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:46.010
Good luck with the film.

123
00:17:12.536 --> 00:17:14.772
Excuse me.

124
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:34.357
♪ Hear the echo ♪

125
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:36.693
♪ Hear the echo ♪

126
00:17:36.828 --> 00:17:42.432
♪ Come play with me,
come play with me ♪


127
00:18:45.162 --> 00:18:50.134
-♪ Hear the echo,
hear the echo ♪


128
00:18:50.268 --> 00:18:51.335
Wait!

129
00:18:57.375 --> 00:18:59.576
-What's all that stuff?

130
00:18:59.709 --> 00:19:01.379
-I'm making a film.

131
00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:03.781
-Is it a cartoon?

132
00:19:03.915 --> 00:19:06.350
-It's called
stop-motion animation.


133
00:19:06.483 --> 00:19:08.485
-Can I see?

134
00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:16.526
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

135
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.930
That's not a toy.

136
00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:23.935
It's okay. It's just.
It's delicate.


137
00:19:25.702 --> 00:19:28.738
Look, I'll show you
how it works.


138
00:19:28.873 --> 00:19:33.277
So, here's Mrs. Cyclops,
and inside her is an armature.


139
00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:34.412
-An arm chair?

140
00:19:34.544 --> 00:19:36.446
-Armature.

141
00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:38.648
It's -
- It's like her skeleton.

142
00:19:38.783 --> 00:19:42.452
- Armature.
- Here.


143
00:19:42.585 --> 00:19:44.922
-Say, that's inside that.

144
00:19:45.056 --> 00:19:48.692
-See, I move her
a tiny bit like this.


145
00:19:48.826 --> 00:19:51.128
And then, I take a picture
with this camera here.


146
00:19:51.262 --> 00:19:52.495
Click.

147
00:19:52.629 --> 00:19:55.299
I'll move her again.

148
00:19:55.433 --> 00:19:57.034
Click, and again, click.

149
00:19:57.168 --> 00:19:58.535
-And when you play
it all back,


150
00:19:58.668 --> 00:20:00.805
it looks like she's moving.

151
00:20:00.938 --> 00:20:04.241
-That's right.
-Yeah, that's a cartoon.


152
00:20:06.143 --> 00:20:08.112
It must take ages.

153
00:20:08.245 --> 00:20:09.280
-It does.

154
00:20:09.413 --> 00:20:11.315
-Why bother?

155
00:20:11.449 --> 00:20:13.516
-Well, because I like it,

156
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.120
and I'm good at it.

157
00:20:16.253 --> 00:20:17.654
And...

158
00:20:17.788 --> 00:20:21.993
And it feels like you're
bringing something to life.


159
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.773
It's about a Cyclops.

160
00:20:35.906 --> 00:20:39.243
She traded one eye with the gods
to see her destiny.


161
00:20:40.543 --> 00:20:42.213
But she saw her own death.

162
00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:49.186
What do you think?

163
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.489
-Hm?

164
00:20:51.621 --> 00:20:53.656
Well?

165
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:55.993
It's a bit boring.

166
00:20:57.194 --> 00:21:00.231
-It's not finished,
and it's not boring.


167
00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:05.036
Well, how do you think
I could make it better?


168
00:21:08.305 --> 00:21:11.075
-I'm serious.
How would you do it?


169
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.478
-Make a new one.

170
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:16.613
-A new one?
-Yeah.


171
00:21:16.746 --> 00:21:18.482
I know a better story.

172
00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:20.251
You want to hear it?

173
00:21:20.384 --> 00:21:22.153
-Go on then.

174
00:21:25.489 --> 00:21:30.861
-There's a girl in the woods,
and she's scared.


175
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.099
-Why is she scared?

176
00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:37.868
-Because she's lost.

177
00:21:38.002 --> 00:21:40.237
-And what's so scary
about that?


178
00:21:41.939 --> 00:21:43.808
-There's someone coming.

179
00:21:45.575 --> 00:21:47.577
-Who's coming?

180
00:21:50.948 --> 00:21:52.850
-What's that stuff?

181
00:21:52.983 --> 00:21:56.387
-Uh, it's called
Mortician's Wax.


182
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.890
They use it to fix up the faces
of dead bodies for, like,


183
00:22:00.024 --> 00:22:01.926
when the families want to see.

184
00:22:02.793 --> 00:22:05.695
-You should definitely
make a girl from this.


185
00:22:06.263 --> 00:22:08.899
-Yeah, right.
-Like, definitely.


186
00:22:09.033 --> 00:22:12.036
-Look, I've got
to get on now, so...


187
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:13.571
-What else do you got here?

188
00:22:13.703 --> 00:22:15.773
-It's been really nice
to meet you.


189
00:22:15.906 --> 00:22:17.674
-How long are you
going to be here?


190
00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:19.709
-I don't know.

191
00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:36.753
-Someone's been busy.

192
00:23:48.232 --> 00:23:49.699
Ella.

193
00:24:00.578 --> 00:24:02.813
Give me your hand.

194
00:25:16.587 --> 00:25:19.957
We'll go back to mine.
You need a break.


195
00:25:30.634 --> 00:25:33.270
You'll feel
better after some food.


196
00:25:34.605 --> 00:25:37.041
-I'm not hungry.

197
00:25:41.078 --> 00:25:43.080
-Look at that. Huh?

198
00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:04.935
There's someone coming.

199
00:27:14.605 --> 00:27:16.340
-Hi.

200
00:27:19.743 --> 00:27:21.813
Are you looking for, Tom?

201
00:27:21.945 --> 00:27:23.147
He's not here.

202
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.349
-I came to see you, actually.

203
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:29.653
Tom told me about your mom.

204
00:27:29.788 --> 00:27:31.922
I just...

205
00:27:32.055 --> 00:27:34.826
I wanted to see
if you were okay.


206
00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:36.193
Hm?

207
00:27:36.326 --> 00:27:38.395
-I'm okay. Thank you.

208
00:27:41.031 --> 00:27:43.200
-So...

209
00:27:43.333 --> 00:27:45.235
What are you doing in there?

210
00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:47.404
-Um, just a project.

211
00:27:47.538 --> 00:27:49.306
-Oh, yeah?

212
00:27:54.945 --> 00:27:57.548
-Uh, do you wanna come in?
-Oh.


213
00:27:57.681 --> 00:28:00.083
Okay. Yeah.

214
00:28:12.062 --> 00:28:14.598
What are you on?
-I'm not on anything.


215
00:28:14.731 --> 00:28:16.133
-No?

216
00:28:16.266 --> 00:28:18.669
Get my best ideas
when I'm tripping my tits off.


217
00:28:22.673 --> 00:28:25.676
You know what? This might be
good for something we're doing.


218
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.511
You should come in for a chat.

219
00:28:28.813 --> 00:28:30.747
-The adverts?

00:28:31.515 --> 00:28:34.485

221

00:28:40.691 --> 00:28:43.026
You're making my film?

223
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.296
-Well, really, it's my film.
-What do I press?


224
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.600
-Hang on. Settle down.
I'll press it.


225
00:28:59.811 --> 00:29:02.881
-You don't like it?

226
00:29:03.013 --> 00:29:05.716
Well, what's wrong with it?

227
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.217
-She doesn't look real.

228
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:09.586
-She's not supposed
to look real.


229
00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:18.595
You told me to use the wax.

230
00:29:18.729 --> 00:29:20.764
What are you looking for?

231
00:29:27.005 --> 00:29:29.172
-See?
-See what?


232
00:29:29.306 --> 00:29:31.475
-Make a new girl out of this.

233
00:29:34.378 --> 00:29:38.549
Just imagine.

234
00:29:41.886 --> 00:29:44.321
-It's raw meat. Dead meat.

235
00:29:44.454 --> 00:29:47.391
-Yeah, but you
bring it to life.


236
00:29:49.027 --> 00:29:50.460
-Well, it's too late anyway.

237
00:29:50.594 --> 00:29:52.296
I've already started
with the other one.


238
00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:53.865
-No, the next bit.

239
00:29:53.998 --> 00:29:55.432
-Well, then it won't be
the same as the first bit.


240
00:29:55.566 --> 00:29:58.735
-So what? Maybe she's
growing up or something.


241
00:30:01.773 --> 00:30:03.808
Go on. Please.

242
00:30:03.942 --> 00:30:06.443
I'll tell you what happens next.

243
00:30:06.577 --> 00:30:08.679

So, the guy runs away
through the woods.


247
00:30:28.298 --> 00:30:31.936
She finds a house,
and she hides in it.


248
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.237
-And who's coming for her?

249
00:30:34.371 --> 00:30:38.810
Maybe a wolf, like a "Red
Riding Hood" type thing.


250
00:30:38.943 --> 00:30:39.944
-It's a man.

251
00:30:40.078 --> 00:30:41.478
-What man?

252
00:30:41.612 --> 00:30:44.048
-A man no one wants to meet.

253
00:30:49.053 --> 00:30:51.722
He comes on three nights.

254
00:30:57.294 --> 00:30:59.030
-What does he want?

255
00:30:59.162 --> 00:31:01.598
-Hey, that's much better.

256
00:31:04.102 --> 00:31:05.870
See.

257
00:31:08.205 --> 00:31:10.440
You can use our skin.

258
00:31:14.879 --> 00:31:16.647
See?

259
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.826
Looks better from down here.

260
00:31:32.964 --> 00:31:35.133
-Like that?
-Yeah.


261
00:32:51.475 --> 00:32:53.677
-What should we call this guy?

262
00:32:58.816 --> 00:33:00.751
-Hm.

263
00:33:07.257 --> 00:33:08.926
Ashes to ashes.

264
00:33:11.328 --> 00:33:13.463
-The Ash Man.

265
00:33:13.597 --> 00:33:16.033
-The man no one wants to meet.

266
00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:20.805
-What are you doing?

267
00:33:20.938 --> 00:33:25.042
- <i>This new...the album.</i>

268
00:33:26.276 --> 00:33:28.212
<i>How's your film going?</i>

269
00:33:28.345 --> 00:33:30.514
-It's going well.

270
00:33:30.647 --> 00:33:35.418
Actually, um.
There was something.


271
00:33:35.552 --> 00:33:39.090
No, I was --
I was wondering if...


272
00:33:39.223 --> 00:33:43.094
Would it be okay if you don't
tell your sister what I'm doing?


273
00:33:43.227 --> 00:33:45.295
She visited today.

274
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:55.039
Thanks.

275
00:33:55.173 --> 00:34:00.278
Yeah. No, um, we could have
lunch tomorrow, if you like.


276
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.979
<i>
-Can't, I'm working.</i>

277
00:34:02.113 --> 00:34:06.784
<i>See you at the party?</i>
<i>Flat 28. Ground floor.</i>


278
00:34:06.918 --> 00:34:08.718
-Mm-hm.

279
00:34:38.082 --> 00:34:39.382
-He will come...

280
00:34:39.516 --> 00:34:41.185
on three nights.

281
00:35:34.038 --> 00:35:36.740
-What are you doing?
Why are you up?


282
00:35:36.874 --> 00:35:40.111
Come on, I found something.

283
00:35:40.244 --> 00:35:43.446
-Come on.

284
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.748
-Slow down.

285
00:35:44.882 --> 00:35:46.483
-If you're going to make
The Ash Man,


286
00:35:46.616 --> 00:35:48.819
you need to do it properly.
-I've already made The Ash Man.


287
00:35:48.953 --> 00:35:52.223
-No, he needs to be made
out of something dead.


288
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.806
We could make an arm trowel
with the bones,


289
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.543
wrap them in skin, and give them
teeth and a tongue.


290
00:36:15.112 --> 00:36:17.148
-Okay. I think we need
to go back now.


291
00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:18.249
-Oh. Come on.

292
00:36:18.382 --> 00:36:20.785
-No.
-Yes.


293
00:36:20.918 --> 00:36:22.652
-Look, using a bit
of leftover meat is one thing.


294
00:36:22.787 --> 00:36:24.721
This is something else.

295
00:36:24.855 --> 00:36:28.658
-Well, I won't tell you
the next bit of the story, then.


296
00:36:28.793 --> 00:36:31.429
-This is my film.
-Is it?


297
00:36:31.561 --> 00:36:33.697
What happens next?

298
00:36:35.765 --> 00:36:38.002
What happens
on that first night?


299
00:36:46.576 --> 00:36:48.112
Do it without me, then.

300
00:37:00.992 --> 00:37:03.760
-So, it's the first night,

301
00:37:03.894 --> 00:37:07.131
and The Ash Man
comes and knocks.


302
00:37:07.264 --> 00:37:09.066
And then...

303
00:37:11.701 --> 00:37:13.804
And then...

304
00:37:27.918 --> 00:37:30.553
I came to say, I'm sorry.

305
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.060
I couldn't finish your film.

306
00:37:36.193 --> 00:37:38.229
I started my own.

307
00:37:42.833 --> 00:37:45.236
Except it wasn't mine, was it?

308
00:37:46.971 --> 00:37:50.408
Just someone else's.

309
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.741
Again?

310
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.784
I just don't have it in me,
do I?


311
00:37:59.917 --> 00:38:01.919
Without someone telling me
what to do.


312
00:38:23.274 --> 00:38:27.011
-Hey. You came.
-Where's your sister?


313
00:38:27.144 --> 00:38:30.047
-Uh, she is...

314
00:38:36.821 --> 00:38:42.592
-Hey. Hey!
-Hey, how are you?


315
00:38:42.725 --> 00:38:44.061
I was just talking about you.

316
00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:46.997
When are you going to come in
for that chat?


317
00:38:47.131 --> 00:38:48.499
-You know what you said
about getting


318
00:38:48.631 --> 00:38:50.201
your best ideas.

319
00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:51.969
You know, um,

320
00:38:52.103 --> 00:38:55.372
"Tripping your tits off."

321
00:38:55.506 --> 00:38:58.242
-Yeah.
-Have you got some?


322
00:38:59.543 --> 00:39:00.511
-Are you sure?

323
00:39:24.335 --> 00:39:27.404
-Hey. All good?

324
00:39:28.606 --> 00:39:31.108
I'm serious
about that job, you know.


325
00:39:31.242 --> 00:39:32.910
We're pitching next week,
so how about tomorrow?


326
00:39:33.043 --> 00:39:35.645
-I'd kill myself if I had
to work in a place like that.


327
00:39:49.126 --> 00:39:50.628
-Howdy.

328
00:40:07.912 --> 00:40:11.215
Hear the echo.

329
00:40:11.348 --> 00:40:13.716
Come with me.

330
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.230
It is her.

331
00:40:26.363 --> 00:40:28.666
Look for it.

332
00:40:28.799 --> 00:40:31.468
Find it, Ella.

333
00:40:31.602 --> 00:40:33.770
Find it.

334
00:44:56.033 --> 00:44:58.903
-The Ash Man
comes on three nights.


335
00:45:02.306 --> 00:45:06.109
<i>-"The Ash Man</i>
<i>comes on three nights."</i>


336
00:45:09.746 --> 00:45:11.515
-On the first night...

337
00:45:11.648 --> 00:45:14.651
He sees her.

338
00:45:14.786 --> 00:45:17.956
-Talking to yourself is
the first sign of madness.


339
00:45:18.088 --> 00:45:20.057
-Look who's talking.

340
00:45:23.962 --> 00:45:26.763
-The Ash Man has to be made
out of something dead.


341
00:45:30.734 --> 00:45:32.336
I see that now.

342
00:45:32.469 --> 00:45:34.906
♪ Dum-de-dum ♪

343
00:45:35.038 --> 00:45:37.541
♪ Dum, de, dum, de, dum, mm ♪

344
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.161
-Well, come on, then.

345
00:46:34.966 --> 00:46:37.200
Much better.

346
00:46:56.253 --> 00:46:59.791
See.

347
00:46:59.924 --> 00:47:03.061
So, the girl is in the bungalow,

348
00:47:03.226 --> 00:47:05.830
and The Ash Man's coming.

349
00:47:05.964 --> 00:47:10.601
She tries to hide, but...

350
00:47:12.436 --> 00:47:14.304
...he sees her.

351
00:51:01.299 --> 00:51:02.732
- Ella.

352
00:51:02.867 --> 00:51:06.369
Ella.

353
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.410
He saw me.
-Who saw you?


354
00:51:13.543 --> 00:51:16.379
Hey, it's me.

355
00:51:18.015 --> 00:51:18.983
Look...

356
00:51:19.116 --> 00:51:21.551
did you take something
last night?


357
00:51:21.685 --> 00:51:24.055
Snacks will probably
give you something.


358
00:51:30.393 --> 00:51:32.129
-I didn't touch it.

359
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.601
The men from my film,

360
00:51:37.734 --> 00:51:40.137
he came and looked
through the door, saw me.


361
00:51:50.147 --> 00:51:53.383
-No, no, no, look,
you animated it. See?


362
00:52:24.181 --> 00:52:25.582
-I want to go.

363
00:52:25.715 --> 00:52:29.153
I want to go.

364
00:52:29.287 --> 00:52:31.588
I want to go.
I want to go. I want to go.


365
00:52:31.721 --> 00:52:33.523
-All right,
we're gonna go, okay.


366
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.829
-I need a shower.

367
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.062
-How'd you sleep?

368
00:54:52.396 --> 00:54:54.165
-Good.

369
00:54:58.235 --> 00:55:00.137
-What do you want?

370
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.341
-Um...

371
00:55:04.475 --> 00:55:06.544
-You don't have to lie to me.

372
00:55:06.676 --> 00:55:09.447
I know you didn't
sleep last night.


373
00:55:09.579 --> 00:55:13.650
Whatever it is you think you saw
back there, it's not real.


374
00:55:15.386 --> 00:55:17.988
-Yeah.

375
00:55:18.122 --> 00:55:21.092
-You can have a bit of fun,
as well.


376
00:55:21.225 --> 00:55:24.195
It's like me,
I don't let music rule my life.


377
00:55:24.328 --> 00:55:25.762
It's all about balance.

378
00:55:30.868 --> 00:55:32.103
-It's fucking Barry Gibb

379
00:55:32.236 --> 00:55:33.904
from the "Bee Gees."

380
00:55:34.038 --> 00:55:35.672
-Don't you see,
it's fucking Barry Gibb?


381
00:55:35.806 --> 00:55:37.208
It's the hair.
-Sh.


382
00:55:37.341 --> 00:55:40.044
- Sorry.

383
00:55:45.483 --> 00:55:47.218
Thank you.

384
00:55:51.255 --> 00:55:54.024
-Tomorrow, I just -- I think
you should just go out


385
00:55:54.158 --> 00:55:56.227
and do something.
-Like what?


386
00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.895
-Something normal.

387
00:55:58.028 --> 00:55:59.563
It's not healthy to stay in...

388
00:56:22.219 --> 00:56:25.122
Don't you want to hear
the next bit of the story?


389
00:56:25.256 --> 00:56:27.224
-Leave me alone.
I've changed my mind.


390
00:56:27.358 --> 00:56:29.593
I don't want to make
this film anymore.


391
00:56:29.726 --> 00:56:32.662
-On the first night,
he sees her...


392
00:56:32.796 --> 00:56:34.231
-Shut up.

393
00:56:34.365 --> 00:56:37.968
-On the second night,
he touches her.


394
00:56:42.373 --> 00:56:44.909
-Maybe, I was
too quick to leave.


395
00:56:46.644 --> 00:56:49.013
-Well, hang on. There is
no way you're going back there.


396
00:56:49.146 --> 00:56:52.016
-What else am I going to do?
I can't stop thinking about it.


397
00:56:52.149 --> 00:56:55.452
I-I don't know
how to do anything else.


398
00:56:55.586 --> 00:56:57.154
-Okay, okay, then -- then --

399
00:56:57.288 --> 00:56:59.123
Then, you can come
help me at work,


400
00:56:59.256 --> 00:57:00.524
and that will distract you.

401
00:57:00.658 --> 00:57:02.793
-What, in some admin office

402
00:57:02.927 --> 00:57:04.895
on a building site.

403
00:57:12.369 --> 00:57:14.771
-Yeah. Sure. No.
I appreciate your efforts.


404
00:57:14.905 --> 00:57:16.774
It's just time is money.

405
00:57:16.907 --> 00:57:19.009
-Best if you don't
wander around.


406
00:57:19.143 --> 00:57:21.011
Just call me
If you need something.


407
00:57:21.145 --> 00:57:23.013
-Am I not working
with you?


408
00:57:23.147 --> 00:57:24.448
-Here's the director.

409
00:57:24.582 --> 00:57:27.218
-Stop whining.
-Brett, this is Ella Blake.


410
00:57:27.351 --> 00:57:29.486
-Ah, hi.

411
00:57:31.055 --> 00:57:33.090
Uh, Ella, over here.

412
00:57:33.224 --> 00:57:34.992
We've got a crowd
scene tomorrow


413
00:57:35.125 --> 00:57:36.493
for this toothpaste gig.

414
00:57:36.627 --> 00:57:39.930
And we need a hundred eyes.

415
00:57:41.098 --> 00:57:43.200
-I thought I was animating.

416
00:57:46.103 --> 00:57:48.105
-Got to go
prep my pitch.


417
00:57:48.239 --> 00:57:49.573
Have fun.

418
00:57:49.707 --> 00:57:53.110
-No, you're not animating.
You're making eyes.


419
00:57:53.244 --> 00:57:57.081
You just roll them up like that.
And don't forget they're people.


420
00:57:57.214 --> 00:57:59.016
They don't need to be
exactly the same.


421
00:57:59.149 --> 00:58:00.851
-Just roll them up?

422
00:58:00.985 --> 00:58:03.387
-Yeah, you just roll them up.

423
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.557
7 mil wide. People, 3 mil.

424
00:58:07.491 --> 00:58:11.495
Well, I'll be on 205, mate.

425
00:58:11.629 --> 00:58:13.931
Let's move like cg, okay?

426
00:58:25.476 --> 00:58:28.445
-I watched your mom's films
in uni.


427
00:58:30.214 --> 00:58:32.650
The Medusa one.

428
00:58:32.783 --> 00:58:36.287
Must been amazing growing up
in that environment.


429
00:59:01.478 --> 00:59:03.647
Great -
- Great writers.

430
00:59:03.782 --> 00:59:06.317
-Always for me.
-Thank you.


431
00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:09.453
-I think it really...
-Sorry.


432
00:59:22.566 --> 00:59:24.568
-What is this?

433
00:59:24.702 --> 00:59:26.603
-It's a mood board.

434
00:59:29.373 --> 00:59:32.042
-These are pictures of my film.

435
00:59:32.176 --> 00:59:33.877
-For reference.

436
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:35.512
Anyway, it's not
exactly the same.


437
00:59:35.646 --> 00:59:37.715
I smartened up a bit.

438
00:59:37.848 --> 00:59:42.119
Besides, I offered it to you,
and you told me to stick it.


439
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.521
-It's mine.

440
00:59:44.655 --> 00:59:46.924
-Don't be so precious.

441
00:59:47.057 --> 00:59:49.326
Anyway, I was going
to give you some money.


442
00:59:51.428 --> 00:59:53.263
- What are you doing?

443
00:59:53.397 --> 00:59:56.133
Hey. Stop! Stop! Stop!

444
00:59:56.266 --> 00:59:57.601
Okay, okay.

445
00:59:57.735 --> 01:00:00.371
Thank you, thank you.
Please, that's enough.


446
01:00:00.504 --> 01:00:01.939
Ella.

447
01:00:28.232 --> 01:00:31.435
-It's a wonderful medium,
isn't it?


448
01:00:34.271 --> 01:00:37.608
Bringing dead things to life.

449
01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:47.384
-What happens when it takes
on a life of its own?


450
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.722
-Are you scared?

451
01:00:51.856 --> 01:00:54.691
-I'm scared at what'll happen
if I carry on?


452
01:00:55.926 --> 01:00:59.196
And I'm scared of what will
happen if I don't.


453
01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:02.166
-Poor, poppet.

454
01:01:04.468 --> 01:01:07.471
Such a morbid imagination.

455
01:01:09.373 --> 01:01:11.575
-I must take after my mum.

456
01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:16.246
-Mm, the difference
is I can control it.


457
01:01:16.947 --> 01:01:19.750
You can't.

458
01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:22.352
-Of course, you'd think that.

459
01:01:22.486 --> 01:01:24.121
Look at you now.

460
01:01:25.756 --> 01:01:28.358
I'm the one living my life.

461
01:01:28.492 --> 01:01:32.329
It's my turn.

462
01:01:32.996 --> 01:01:35.399
You can't control anything.

463
01:01:36.733 --> 01:01:38.969
You're a puppet...

464
01:01:39.102 --> 01:01:42.139
caught in your own strings.

465
01:01:42.272 --> 01:01:45.976
And if it isn't me pulling them,
it's somebody else.


466
01:01:47.244 --> 01:01:51.081
But when the puppets are done
with their play...


467
01:01:54.017 --> 01:01:56.353
...they're put back in the box.

468
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:22.446
-So, now it's the second night.

469
01:02:23.982 --> 01:02:27.184
And The Ash Man comes back.

470
01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:32.991
And this time, he touches her.

471
01:02:33.123 --> 01:02:36.126
-No, that's not what happens.

472
01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.962
The girl escapes,
and The Ash Man


473
01:02:38.128 --> 01:02:40.163
doesn't touch her.

474
01:02:41.933 --> 01:02:43.767
-That's not how it goes.

475
01:02:43.902 --> 01:02:46.103
He comes three nights.

476
01:02:46.236 --> 01:02:48.105
On the first night, he sees her,

477
01:02:48.238 --> 01:02:50.641
and on the second night,
he touches her.


478
01:02:50.775 --> 01:02:53.076
-Not anymore.
-You can't change it.


479
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:56.313
-Yes, I can, it's my film.

480
01:03:02.619 --> 01:03:04.521
-Okay, then.

481
01:03:19.336 --> 01:03:22.673
-On the second night,
she escapes.


482
01:07:21.045 --> 01:07:22.980
-I told you.

483
01:07:30.988 --> 01:07:33.858
-Keep your head still.
Follow my finger.


484
01:07:36.894 --> 01:07:39.797
You were found wandering
near your building.


485
01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.365
Do you remember how you got
that cut on your leg?


486
01:07:42.499 --> 01:07:44.701
-My head still hurts.

487
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:49.773
-We're keeping you
in overnight under observation.


488
01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:53.878
Rest now.
We'll talk more later.


489
01:07:58.015 --> 01:08:00.218
She's got a nasty cut
on her leg,


490
01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:03.020
and she's got...

491
01:08:03.154 --> 01:08:05.056
-Thank you.

492
01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:31.148
-If you think I did this
on purpose, the answer is no.


493
01:08:40.358 --> 01:08:44.161
Ella.

494
01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:49.633
Look...

495
01:08:49.766 --> 01:08:53.004
I'm not saying
that you can't do your films.


496
01:08:53.137 --> 01:08:55.505
Once you're better,
you can go back to making stuff.


497
01:08:55.639 --> 01:08:57.775
I mean, we could
even work together.


498
01:08:57.909 --> 01:09:01.145
You could do my music videos
for my album.


499
01:09:03.347 --> 01:09:05.349
What's so funny?

500
01:09:05.482 --> 01:09:07.151
-Nothing.

501
01:09:07.285 --> 01:09:08.585
-No. Go on.

502
01:09:13.423 --> 01:09:16.027
-You don't make music, Tom.

503
01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:19.397
You put on a suit
and go to work.


504
01:09:23.767 --> 01:09:26.971
Fuck you, Ella.
And you're what?


505
01:09:27.104 --> 01:09:29.472
You're some fucking
artistic genius animating


506
01:09:29.606 --> 01:09:31.776
a steak and a dead fox.

507
01:09:31.909 --> 01:09:34.577
Like, who the fuck
wants to see that?!


508
01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:39.549
Yeah, I
-I thought you were

509
01:09:39.683 --> 01:09:40.617
trying to work
through something,


510
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:42.452
so I was trying to help you.

511
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.523
I'm just not doing it anymore.
Do you know what?


512
01:09:46.656 --> 01:09:47.757
I'm going to go there
right now,


513
01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.260
and delete
the whole fucking thing.


514
01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:51.494
-Don't you dare.
-I'm going to clear the flat.


515
01:09:51.628 --> 01:09:52.830
I'm going to throw it all away,

516
01:09:52.964 --> 01:09:53.831
so, we can be done
with this shit.


517
01:09:53.965 --> 01:09:56.400
-Wait, wait. Let me do it.

518
01:09:56.533 --> 01:09:58.535
Just let me do it.

519
01:10:00.237 --> 01:10:02.772
Okay. You're right.

520
01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:06.676
I know this needs to stop.
I know it's bad for me.


521
01:10:08.446 --> 01:10:09.646
But I started it.

522
01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:12.249
I need to be
the one to end it.

523
01:10:12.383 --> 01:10:14.118
Please.

524
01:10:14.251 --> 01:10:16.220
-No.

525
01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.622
We'll do it together.

526
01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:22.525
I'll drive you there
in the morning,


527
01:10:22.659 --> 01:10:25.062
and I want you to do it.

528
01:10:27.365 --> 01:10:29.699
-Thank you.

529
01:10:41.178 --> 01:10:43.280
-I'm so sorry, Ella.

530
01:11:16.646 --> 01:11:18.115
-Are we done here?

531
01:11:51.282 --> 01:11:53.784
♪ Hm, hm, hm, hm ♪

532

♪ Hm, hm, hm, hm,
hm, hm, hm, hm ♪


533
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:09.567
The fox meat doesn't work.

534
01:12:09.699 --> 01:12:12.570
It's all dried out now.

535
01:12:12.702 --> 01:12:15.272
We need to find
something better.


536
01:12:17.842 --> 01:12:21.245
-Something more bleedy.

-Hey, come here a sec.


539
01:12:33.591 --> 01:12:36.026
-What for?

540
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.328
-Come here.

541
01:12:37.461 --> 01:12:39.597
I want to look at you.

542
01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:08.859
-What are you doing?

543
01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.150
-Have you got that out
of your system now?


544
01:14:16.427 --> 01:14:18.195
-Hey, hey.

545
01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:22.166
It's okay.
We're nearly there.


546
01:14:25.436 --> 01:14:27.471
-I'm scared.

547
01:14:30.107 --> 01:14:33.444
What happens on the third night?

548
01:14:33.577 --> 01:14:35.713
What does The Ash Man do?

549
01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:38.315
-Don't be scared.

550
01:14:38.449 --> 01:14:40.750
It'll be all right.

551
01:14:40.884 --> 01:14:43.320
It will be worth it.

552
01:14:43.454 --> 01:14:47.091
Something only you
could have made.


553
01:14:48.592 --> 01:14:53.897
Great artists always put
themselves into their work.


554
01:15:48.118 --> 01:15:50.220
Hand me that.

555
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:34.591
Go!

556
01:17:34.725 --> 01:17:36.427
-Oh, God.

557
01:17:41.498 --> 01:17:42.933
-It's okay.

558
01:17:43.066 --> 01:17:45.335
Come on, Ella.

559
01:17:45.469 --> 01:17:48.038
-Let's get you out of here.

560
01:18:05.857 --> 01:18:08.860
-Oh, gosh. Help me!

561
01:18:08.992 --> 01:18:12.029
Stop! Stop!

562
01:18:12.162 --> 01:18:15.867
-Stop!
-They're gonna ruin this.


563
01:18:15.999 --> 01:18:17.968
-You're bleeding, Ella!

564
01:18:35.385 --> 01:18:39.556
Tom!

565
01:20:12.082 --> 01:20:14.786
Help me. Help me.

566
01:21:49.047 --> 01:21:50.982
-This is even better.

567
01:22:19.743 --> 01:22:21.578
-That bit.

568
01:22:39.897 --> 01:22:41.065
Wow.

569
01:23:30.114 --> 01:23:33.017
-Ready?

570
01:23:33.151 --> 01:23:35.285
Steady.

571
01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:39.322
Go.

572
01:24:13.891 --> 01:24:16.359
-Isn't she going
to do anything?


573
01:24:16.493 --> 01:24:20.730
-Sh. Watch.

574
01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.252
What's he doing?

575
01:24:44.255 --> 01:24:48.092
This isn't what happened.

576
01:28:58.809 --> 01:29:00.610
-I love it.
