00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.595
<i>Let us tell an old story anew,</i>

2
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.988
<i>and we will see
how well you know it.</i>

3
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.235
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

4
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.635
<i>there were two kingdoms
that were the worst of neighbors.</i>


5
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.635
<i>So vast was the discord between them</i>

6
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.266
<i>that it was said only a great hero</i>

7
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.715
<i>or a terrible villain
might bring them together.</i>


8
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.075
<i>In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,</i>


9
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.502
<i>with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.</i>


10
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.155
<i>They were forever discontent,</i>

11
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.309
<i>and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.</i>


12
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.786
<i>For in the other kingdom, the Moors,</i>

13
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.030
<i>lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.</i>


14
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.355
<i>And they needed
neither king nor queen,</i>


15
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.030
<i>but trusted in one another.</i>

16
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.315
<i>In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors</i>


17
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.795
<i>lived one such spirit.</i>

18
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.790
<i>You might take her for a girl,</i>

19
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.383
<i>but she was not just any girl.</i>

20
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.387
<i>She was a fairy.</i>

21
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.745
There you go.

22
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.390
<i>And her name</i>

23
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.985
<i>was Maleficent.</i>

24
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.824
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!

25
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.710
I love your cap!

26
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.183
No. No, don't do it!

27
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.581
You missed me!

28
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.228
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


29
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.510
Lovely work, girls!

30
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.740
What's all the fuss about?

31
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.867
The border guards have discov...

32
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.275
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!


33
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.315
I want to!

34
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.150
There are rules, Flittle.
I tell this time, you tell next time.


35
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.626
No, you told last time,

36
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.820
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.


37
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.221
Tell me what?

38
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.587
Fine!

39
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.981
Thank you.

40
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.955
Maleficent, the border guard...

41
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.348
The border guards have found
a human thief at the pool of jewels.


42
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.831
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.867
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.


44
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.543
Humans, here.
I hope there's not another war.


45
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.475
I'm not afraid.

46
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.868
Besides,
I have never seen a human up close.


47
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.021
Come out!

48
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.271
No. They mean to kill me.

49
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.940
And besides, they're hideous to look at.

50
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.990
That's extremely rude.

51
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.028
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.


52
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.190
It's not right to steal,

53
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.675
but we don't kill people for it.

54
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.747
Come out.

55
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.631
Come out this instant!

56
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.626
Are you fully grown?

57
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.541
No.

58
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.822
I believe he's just a boy.

59
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.984
And you're just a girl.

60
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.235
I think.

61
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.261
Who are you?

62
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.265
I'm called Stefan.

63
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.061
Who are you?

64
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.781
I'm Maleficent.

65
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.831
Yes, right.

66
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.421
You have to give it back.

67
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.466
Give what back?

68
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.315
If I knew you would throw it away,
I would have kept it.


69
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.626
I didn't throw it away.

70
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.104
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.


71
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.906
Someday, you know, 
I'll live there.

72
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.909
In the castle.

73
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.985
Where do you live now?

74
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.661
In a barn.

75
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.144
So your parents are farmers, then?

76
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.302
My parents are dead.

77
00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.786
Mine, too.

78
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.910
We'll see each other again.

79
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.595
You really shouldn't
come back here, you know.


80
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.190
It's not safe.

81
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.707
And if I made that choice,

82
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.789
if I came back, would you be here?

83
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.827
Perhaps.

84
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.624
- What's wrong?
- Your ring.


85
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.911
Iron burns fairies.

86
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.427
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.504
I like your wings.

88
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.061
<i>Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,</i>


89
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.707
<i>he who had so little in the world,</i>

90
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.788
<i>so that their hands might touch again,</i>

91
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.584
<i>and her heart was moved.</i>

92
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.995
<i>Thus did the young thief
who had hoped to steal a jewel...</i>


93
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.075
Maleficent!

94
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.546
<i>...steal something far more precious.</i>

95
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.550
Maleficent?

96
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.586
Maleficent!

97
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.620
After all these weeks,

98
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.510
look who came back.

99
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.502
I thought it worth the risk.

100
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.427
So, what do you do for fun?

101
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.145
<i>Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.</i>


102
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.386
<i>And for a time it seemed as if,
in them at least,</i>


103
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.825
<i>the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.</i>


104
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.910
<i>As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.</i>


105
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.395
<i>And on her 16th birthday,</i>

106
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.787
<i>Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.</i>

107
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.746
<i>He told her it was true love's kiss.</i>

108
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.868
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

109
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.795
<i>As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,</i>


110
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.620
<i>and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.</i>


111
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.275
<i>While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,</i>


112
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.270
<i>rose to become
the protector of the Moors.</i>


113
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.061
<i>Maleficent often wandered alone</i>

114
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.184
<i>and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,</i>


115
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.062
<i>for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.</i>


116
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.268
<i>But she was to learn.</i>

117
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.155
<i>For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,</i>


118
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.104
<i>and he sought to strike it down.</i>

119
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.983
Guard, halt!

120
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.670
Guard, halt!

121
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.225
There they are,

122
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.195
the mysterious Moors
where no one dares to venture


123
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.542
for fear of the magical creatures
that lurk within.


124
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.142
Well, I say crush them!

125
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.268
Go no further!

126
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.635
A king

127
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.301
does not take orders from a winged elf.

128
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.343
You are no king to me.

129
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.267
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!


130
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.821
Advance!

131
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.463
Arise and stand with me!

132
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.790
Hold the line!

133
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.066
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!


134
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.667
Charge!

135
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.221
You!

136
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.426
To the king!

137
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.270
You will not have the Moors!

138
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.383
Not now, nor ever!

139
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.901
You...

140
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.026
When I ascended to the throne,

141
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.266
I promised the people

142
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.505
one day we would take

143
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.940
the Moors and its treasures.

144
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.630
Each of you

145
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.301
swore allegiance to me
and to that cause.


146
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.901
Your Majesty.

147
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.788
Defeated in battle.

148
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.509
Is this to be my legacy?

149
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.667
I see you waiting for me to die.

150
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.589
It won't be long. 
But what then?

151
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.029
I will choose a successor

152
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.869
to take the throne
and care for my daughter.


153
00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.626
Who among you

154
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.349
is worthy?

155
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.395
Kill the winged creature.

156
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.104
Avenge me,

157
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.346
and upon my death
you will take the crown.


158
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.549
Maleficent.

159
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.588
Maleficent!

160
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.230
So, how is life with the humans?

161
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.309
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

162
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.225
They mean to kill you.

163
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.787
King Henry will stop at nothing.

164
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.583
Please, you have to trust me.

165
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.755
<i>They spoke of many things,</i>

166
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.544
<i>and the years faded away.</i>

167
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.349
<i>And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,</i>


168
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.183
<i>and all was as
it had been long ago.</i>

169
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.386
You thirsty?

170
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.671
Maleficent?

171
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.581
What is this?

172
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.941
I have avenged you, sire.

173
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.782
She is vanquished?

174
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.668
You have done well, my son.

175
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.467
You have done
what others feared to do.


176
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.622
You will be rewarded.

177
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.350
I shall do my best
to be a worthy successor,


178
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.625
Your Majesty.

179
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.070
I've got you!

180
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.548
- You wicked bird!
- Into a man.


181
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.551
It's a...

182
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.866
It's a demon!

183
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.235
What have you done
to my beautiful self?


184
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.228
Would you
rather I let them beat you to death?


185
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.475
I'm not certain.

186
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.104
Stop complaining.

187
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.310
I saved your life.

188
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.745
Forgive me.

189
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.786
What do I call you?

190
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.790
Diaval.

191
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.623
And in return for saving my life,
I am your servant.


192
00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.190
Whatever you need.

193
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.746
Wings.

194
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.349
I need you to be my wings.

195
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.710
I present to you
the first of his line,

196
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.582
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

197
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.784
He did this to me
so he would be king.

198
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.630
Now what, Mistress?

199
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.784
Her wings!

200
00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.501
It's a girl!

201
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.944
It's a girl! It's a girl!

202
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.387
Well?

203
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.263
Well, I saw nothing.

204
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.621
But there's been a...

205
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.301
What?

206
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.941
Child.

207
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.704
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.


208
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.702
There will be a christening.

209
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.229
They say it's to be a grand celebration.

210
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.702
A grand celebration for a baby.

211
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.546
How wonderful.

212
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.875
<i>All manner of folk
came to the christening,</i>


213
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.235
<i>even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.</i>


214
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.275
Look, there's the baby!

215
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.595
I love babies!

216
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.749
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.


217
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.075
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.671
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland Fair Folk.


219
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.629
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

220
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.386
And I'm Thistlewit, 
Your Royalnesses.

221
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.470
They bring gifts for our daughter.

222
00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.348
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!


223
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.390
And very good with children.

224
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.950
Very well.

225
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.987
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

226
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.065
the gift of beauty.

227
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.821
My wish is that
you will never be blue,

228
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.826
only happy, all the days of your life.

229
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.104
Sweet baby,

230
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.585
my wish for you is that you find...

231
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.341
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!


232
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.629
Well, well.

233
00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.060
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.


234
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.864
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...

235
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.466
How quaint.

236
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.743
Even the rabble.

237
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.584
I must say

238
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.901
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.


239
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.150
You're not welcome here.

240
00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.706
Oh, dear.

241
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.581
What an awkward situation.

242
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.425
You're not offended?

243
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.181
Why, no.

244
00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.426
And to show I bear no ill will,

245
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.790
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

246
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.630
No! We don't want your gift!

247
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.155
Stay away from the princess!

248
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.182
Yes, stay away!

249
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.475
Listen well, all of you.

250
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.980
<i>Listen well, all of you.</i>

251
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:08.303
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,


252
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.029
beloved by all who meet her.

253
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.071
That's a lovely gift.

254
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.500
Don't do this.

255
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.386
But

256
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.301
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,


257
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.661
she will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel


258
00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.426
and fall into a sleep like death,

259
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.510
a sleep from which
she will never awaken.


260
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.106
Maleficent, please don't do this,
I'm begging you.


261
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.303
I like you begging.

262
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.030
Do it again.

263
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.506
I beg you.

264
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.185
All right.

265
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.307
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,


266
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.708
but only by

267
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.902
true love's kiss.

268
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.906
This curse will last
till the end of time!

269
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.071
No power on Earth can change it.

270
00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.635
<i>King Stefan ordered his men</i>

271
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.391
<i>to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.</i>


272
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.395
<i>The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,</i>


273
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:23.391
<i>and thrown into the deepest dungeon
in the castle.</i>


274
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.555
<i>Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child</i>


275
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.915
<i>to the magic of the pixies,</i>

276
00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:35.310
<i>who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.</i>


277
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.221
<i>Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle</i>


278
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:49.389
<i>while his soldiers rode far and wide
to hunt Maleficent down.</i>


279
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.026
<i>But she made walls of her own,</i>

280
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.795
<i>that the Moors might
never again suffer the touch</i>


281
00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.822
<i>of any human.</i>

282
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.985
<i>And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.</i>


283
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.715
<i>The fairies began their charge</i>

284
00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.711
<i>to raise Aurora in a snug little cottage
in the woods.</i>


285
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.991
No! Is this it?

286
00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.349
Looks dreadful.

287
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.185
Come on.

288
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.075
We need a smaller...

289
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.275
Baby.

290
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.075
Or bigger bodies.

291
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.715
No, what we need is a proper disguise.

292
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.155
What do you mean?

293
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.103
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

294
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.300
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.


295
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.989
So, gather around, ladies.

296
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.022
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

297
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.501
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.


298
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.675
Now, there will be no questions asked.

299
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.701
We are no longer fairies.

300
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.515
We are three peasant women
raising our orphan child in the woods.


301
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.555
- Yes.
- So, no more flying.


302
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.426
- No flying?
- No, no, and no magic.


303
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.911
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.


304
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.195
It's in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.700
At least no one will find us here.

306
00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.195
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?


307
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.222
Come on. There you go.

308
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.382
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.


309
00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.507
I hate you. Beasty.

310
00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.791
<i>The fairies were
perhaps unequal to their task.</i>


311
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.195
Why is she crying?

312
00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.585
I think she might be hungry.

313
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.271
Then feed her!

314
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.350
There you are.

315
00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.900
There you go.

316
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.025
It's going to starve
with those three looking after it.


317
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.790
It tickles.

318
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.989
- What?
- You're cheating.


319
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.540
I saw that!

320
00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.828
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.


321
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.950
Greedy, bloated goat!

322
00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.990
"Bloated goat."

323
00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.180
Stop doing that.

324
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.625
I'm not doing anything.

325
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.026
Well, someone is.

326
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.421
It's not me.

327
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.067
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...


328
00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.986
Stop it!

329
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.181
Why...

330
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.229
No!

331
00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.020
This is all your fault!

332
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.070
Come on. That's funny.

333
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.715
<i>As the days went on, 
Stefan darkened,</i>

334
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.983
<i>further consumed
by paranoia and vengeance.</i>


335
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.786
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!


336
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.465
Flame!

337
00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.261
Release!

338
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.911
Run!

339
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.141
You failed me.

340
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:42.144
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.


341
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.541
Nothing is indestructible!

342
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.824
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!


343
00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.302
Bring me the iron workers.

344
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.941
You!

345
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.746
Look.

346
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.662
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.


347
00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.741
What?

348
00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.229
Hello.

349
00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.227
Go away.

350
00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.146
Go.

351
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.861
Go away.

352
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.302
I don't like children.

353
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.664
Up, up.

354
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.902
Go along. Go, go, go.

355
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.150
<i>As Maleficent had said,</i>

356
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.346
<i>Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.</i>

357
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.991
Pretty bird.

358
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.300
<i>Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.</i>


359
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.870
<i>And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,</i>


360
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.105
<i>so did she.</i>

361
00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.181
Hello.

362
00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.181
That's it.

363
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.435
There you go.

364
00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.111
<i>She wondered at the world about her,</i>

365
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:44.709
<i>and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.</i>


366
00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.942
Curious little beasty.

367
00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.102
<i>But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.</i>


368
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.661
Look.

369
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:12.069
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
- I don't know.


370
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.185
Bring them to me.

371
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.429
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

372
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.220
Steady.

373
00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.542
- It's her!
- It's her!


374
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.980
How could you do that to me?

375
00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.063
You said anything I need.

376
00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.341
Yeah, but not a dog.

377
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.545
It was a wolf, not a dog.

378
00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.346
It's the same thing.

379
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.387
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.


380
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.835
Fine. Next time I'll turn you
into a mealy worm.


381
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.421
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...


382
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.790
I wonder.

383
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.946
I know you're there.

384
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.911
Don't be afraid.

385
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:44.866
I am not afraid.

386
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.704
Then come out.

387
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.509
Then you'll be afraid.

388
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.540
No, I won't.

389
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:10.826
I know who you are.

390
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.587
Do you?

391
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.908
You're my Fairy Godmother.

392
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.787
What?

393
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.864
Fairy Godmother.

394
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.587
You've been watching over me
my whole life.


395
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.222
I've always known you were close by.

396
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.915
How?

397
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.945
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.


398
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.105
Wherever I went,
your shadow was always with me.


399
00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.586
I remember you.

400
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.945
Pretty bird.

401
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.940
This is Diaval.

402
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.181
Hello, Aurora.

403
00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.981
I have known you
since you were a little one.


404
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.586
It's everything I imagined it would be.

405
00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.103
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...


406
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.982
Good night, beasty.

407
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.110
You mock me.

408
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.421
I know what you're doing.

409
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.355
I know exactly what you're doing.

410
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.381
Sire?

411
00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.147
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.


412
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.867
Leave me.

413
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.144
Sire, she is not well.

414
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:36.062
The nurses are fearful
that she won't make it through the night.


415
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.068
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?


416
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.675
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.


417
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.261
And on that day, 
I will be ready.

418
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.749
They're so beautiful.

419
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.268
I revoke the curse.

420
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.822
Let it be no more.

421
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.589
I revoke the curse.

422
00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.661
Let it be no more.

423
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.589
I revoke my curse!

424
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.585
Let it be no more!

425
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.069
I revoke my curse!

426
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.944
Let it be no more!

427
00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:00.945
Let it be no more!

428
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:12.507
<i>This curse will last
till the end of time.</i>

429
00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.186
<i>No power on Earth can change it.</i>

430
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.580
Do all the Fair People have wings?

431
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.670
Most do.

432
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.943
Then why don't you?

433
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.022
All the other fairies fly.

434
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.666
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.


435
00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.824
That's all I wish to say about it.

436
00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.304
What color were they?

437
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.426
Were they big?

438
00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:08.063
So big
they dragged behind me when I walked.


439
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.835
And they were strong.

440
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.864
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.


441
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.230
And they never faltered, not even once.

442
00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:22.180
I could trust them.

443
00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.950
She's coming. She's coming.

444
00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.027
Where are your workers?

445
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.390
In their beds, Majesty.

446
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.061
Get them back to work without delay.

447
00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.995
They're exhausted, sire.

448
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.830
But I'll have them
back to work at first light.


449
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.822
I need them back to work now.

450
00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.630
It's the wee hours.

451
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.106
Aye.

452
00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:21.821
Aye.

453
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.551
It is the wee hours.

454
00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.710
So wake them up.

455
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.670
Sire?

456
00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.824
So wake them up,
and get them back to work now!


457
00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:38.109
We're running out of time! Go, now!

458
00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.901
Aurora?

459
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.511
Come here.

460
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.306
Sit.

461
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.545
There's something I need to tell you.

462
00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.505
What is it?

463
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.225
There is an evil in this world,

464
00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.542
and I cannot keep you from it.

465
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.266
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

466
00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.110
I can take care of myself.

467
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.185
I understand.

468
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.181
- But that's not what I have to tell you.
- I have a plan.


469
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.675
When I'm older,

470
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.271
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.


471
00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.948
Then we can look after each other.

472
00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.744
You don't have to wait until you're older.

473
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.186
You could live here now.

474
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.424
Then I will.

475
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.755
I'll sleep in a tree
and eat berries and black nuts


476
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.431
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.


477
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.782
I'll be happy here for
the rest of my life.

478
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.307
I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.

479
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.704
Until tomorrow.

480
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.826
I'm so excited!

481
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:53.301
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

482
00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.668
I need a life of my own.

483
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.909
No. I love you very much,

484
00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:01.270
but it's time to say goodbye.

485
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.504
You've been very good to me,

486
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.544
except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.


487
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:12.701
Hello.

488
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.395
I'm sorry to bother you,

489
00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.035
but I'm on my way
to King Stefan's castle


490
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.950
and I've become hopelessly lost.

491
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.421
Can you help me?

492
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.946
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...


493
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.065
Forgive me.

494
00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.864
It's that way.

495
00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:45.510
The castle.

496
00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:52.700
What's your name?

497
00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.460
It's Philip.

498
00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.586
Hello, Philip.

499
00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.351
What's yours?

500
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.911
Aurora.

501
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.264
Hello, Aurora.

502
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.155
Well, it was nice meeting you.

503
01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:16.866
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.


504
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:20.066
You're forgiven.

505
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.824
That's good.

506
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.231
I'd best be off, then.

507
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.265
Good bye.

508
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.782
Will you be back this way?

509
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.905
Nothing could stop me.

510
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.265
Then I'll see you soon.

511
01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.431
Very soon.

512
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.663
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.


513
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.383
Stop doing that.

514
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.265
Well?

515
01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.271
That boy's the answer.

516
01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.109
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!


517
01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.995
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.


518
01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.068
True love's kiss?

519
01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.184
Have you not worked it out yet?

520
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:31.949
I cursed her that way
because there is no such thing.


521
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.428
Well, that might be how you feel,

522
01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.621
but what about Aurora?

523
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.783
That boy could be her only chance.

524
01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.780
It's her fate, anyway.

525
01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.141
Go ahead.

526
01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.795
Turn me into whatever you want.

527
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:51.946
A bird, a worm.

528
01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.189
I don't care anymore.

529
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.022
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

530
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.229
We are not leaving tomorrow.

531
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.428
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

532
01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:12.506
And Stefan told us to take her back
the day after her birthday.


533
01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.824
No. He said on her birthday.

534
01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.302
No. The day after her birthday.

535
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.990
- On.
- After.


536
01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.306
- On.
- After.


537
01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.783
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!


538
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.024
Stop it!

539
01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.027
What?

540
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.545
How could you?

541
01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.702
I need to talk to you about something.

542
01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.181
Yes, sweetie, what is it?

543
01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.349
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

544
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.983
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

545
01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.146
Yes.

546
01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.987
I'm leaving home.

547
01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.060
See here, young lady.

548
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.275
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel


549
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.540
with these two imbeciles...

550
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.875
So that you could ruin
it on the last day.

551
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.346
We are taking you back
to your father with...


552
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.591
My father?

553
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.422
You told me my parents were dead.

554
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.230
I think you better come and sit down.

555
01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.503
Fairy Godmother!

556
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.231
I'm here.

557
01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.465
When were you going to tell me
that I'm cursed?


558
01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.780
Is it true?

559
01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.026
It is.

560
01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.423
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

561
01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.305
I... I can't remember her name.

562
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.545
They said

563
01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.746
it was...

564
01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.625
Maleficent.

565
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.670
Is that you?

566
01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.708
Are you Maleficent?

567
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.300
No!

568
01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.345
Don't touch me.

569
01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.744
You're the evil that's in the world.

570
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.471
It's you!

571
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.661
Find the boy!

572
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.515
I need every available man
on the east wing now.


573
01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.755
There should be no guards at the gate.
I want her to walk right in.


574
01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.305
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

575
01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.583
We found this urchin at the gate.

576
01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.268
She claims to be the princess.

577
01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.266
Father.

578
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.429
It's me, Aurora!

579
01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.661
You look just like your mother.

580
01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.229
They brought you back a day too soon.

581
01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.269
I told those three idiots!

582
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.583
Lock her up in her room.

583
01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.186
Go.

584
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.506
Prepare the men. 
Maleficent's coming.

585
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.230
It's so good to be small again!

586
01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.350
Look at my feet!

587
01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.821
I love my tiny little feet!

588
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.825
Pay attention! 
We have to find Aurora,

589
01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.740
or the king will have our heads!

590
01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.941
<i>Aurora.</i>

591
01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.191
Wait!

592
01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.825
Princess?

593
01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.025
I'm looking for a girl.

594
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.270
Of course you are.

595
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.504
I need a horse.

596
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.664
<i>...into a sleep like death.</i>

597
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.509
<i>Aurora.</i>

598
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.221
Come on, Diaval!

599
01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.510
<i>Aurora.</i>

600
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.384
Faster, Diaval, faster!

601
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:05.066
<i>She will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel</i>


602
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.668
<i>and fall into a sleep like death.</i>

603
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.108
<i>No power on Earth...</i>

604
01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.511
<i>A sleep like death.</i>

605
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.300
It's done.

606
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.829
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.


607
01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.345
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.


608
01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.143
Then don't come. 
It's not your fight.

609
01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.349
Thank you very much.

610
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:29.910
"I need you, Diaval.
I can't do this without you, Diaval."


611
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.625
I can hear you.

612
01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.061
Look at her.

613
01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.742
Look at what you've done.

614
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.384
She's only sleeping.

615
01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.625
She's only sleeping, you say?

616
01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.544
She's only sleeping.

617
01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.630
She's only sleeping forever!

618
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.750
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!


619
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.870
True love does not exist.

620
01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.741
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty.

621
01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.871
Mistress.

622
01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.349
What are we going to do?

623
01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.827
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.


624
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.989
But we don't even know where to start.

625
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.706
True love doesn't just fall
from trees, you know.


626
01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.822
Pardon me.

627
01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.347
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know where I am.


628
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.862
In King Stefan's castle.

629
01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.830
This is where I'm meant to be.

630
01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.635
Odd that I can't
recall how I got here.

631
01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.661
Why have you come?

632
01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:17.635
My father sent me to see the King.

633
01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:18.661
Who is your father?

634
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.220
King John of Ulstead.

635
01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.664
A prince!

636
01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.185
Aurora.

637
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.189
He knows her.

638
01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.225
Why is she sleeping?

639
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.702
She's trapped in an enchantment.

640
01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.182
Isn't she beautiful?

641
01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.906
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

642
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.023
Do you want to kiss her?

643
01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.941
Very much.

644
01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.751
Go on, then.

645
01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.195
I wouldn't feel right about it.

646
01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.870
I barely know her. 
We've only met once.

647
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.267
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?


648
01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.950
Kiss her!

649
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.381
Go on.

650
01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.540
An enchantment, you say?

651
01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:16.790
Kiss her!

652
01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.670
You didn't do it properly!

653
01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.515
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!

654
01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.115
I was certain he was the one.

655
01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:17.711
- What are you doing?
- We have to keep looking.


656
01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.146
I told you.

657
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.381
I will not ask your forgiveness

658
01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.987
because what I have done to you
is unforgivable.


659
01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:02.070
I was so lost

660
01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:05.461
in hatred and revenge.

661
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.502
Sweet Aurora,

662
01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.106
you stole what was left of my heart.

663
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.467
And now I have lost you forever.

664
01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:35.550
I swear, no harm will come to you
as long as I live.


665
01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:41.821
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.


666
01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.902
Hello, Godmother.

667
01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.229
Hello, beasty.

668
01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.590
No truer love.

669
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.750
She's here, sire.

670
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:05.943
Are we going back to the Moors now?

671
01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.029
If that is what you wish.

672
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.147
We've got her!

673
01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:45.269
- Stop!
- Get back!


674
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.786
No!

675
01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.025
Into a dragon.

676
01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.540
To the other side.

677
01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.504
Run, Aurora!

678
01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:08.544
Get back! Hold it steady!

679
01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.584
Pull to the left! Pull!

680
01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.391
Hold the line!

681
01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:22.146
Look out. Hold your line.

682
01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.225
- Close in.
- Bring it down!


683
01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:01.906
Enough!

684
01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.664
How does it feel?

685
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.626
To be a fairy creature without wings

686
01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.311
in a world where you don't belong?

687
01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.546
Kill her!

688
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.306
Kill her!

689
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.790
Shoot!

690
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.266
Shoot her!

691
01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.621
Take aim!

692
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:52.621
It's over.

693
01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:15.384
<i>Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns</i>


694
01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.827
<i>and took off her crown.</i>

695
01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.835
<i>And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,</i>


696
01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:26.515
<i>long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child</i>


697
01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.781
<i>and her heart was bright.</i>

698
01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.151
<i>For now, it was again.</i>

699
01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:37.667
<i>But that was not all.</i>

700
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.431
There she is. Hurry up. 
They're waiting.

701
01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.266
Wait for me!

702
01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.302
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,


703
01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.824
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...


704
01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:01.785
Never mind.

705
01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:10.023
Our kingdoms have been unified.

706
01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.783
You have your queen.

707
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.105
<i>So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,</i>


708
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:22.315
<i>and I should know,</i>

709
01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:26.868
<i>for I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.</i>


710
01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:05.355
<i>In the end, my kingdom was united
not by a hero or a villain,</i>


711
01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.355
<i>as legend had predicted,</i>

712
01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:11.385
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>


713
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.981
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>
