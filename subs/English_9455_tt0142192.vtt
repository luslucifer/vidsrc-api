1
00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:34.724
Fukienese Dragons not funny now?

2
00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:37.936
The Fukienese Dragons...

3
00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:40.438
the newest entity
on the Chinatown crime scene...


4
00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:44.567
are headed by 20-year-old Bobby Vu
from the Fukien province of China.


5
00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:49.113
Sources say the bombing
and the execution of a Tong soldier...


6
00:03:49.213 --> 00:03:51.115
are the latest chapter
in a power struggle...


7
00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:53.451
between the Fukienese Dragons
youth gang...


8
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:56.329
and the Tong-run
Tong Fung Benevolent Association...


9
00:03:56.429 --> 00:04:00.291
believed to be headed
by businessman Benjamin Wong...


10
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:02.627
known in the neighborhood
as Uncle Benny...


11
00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:05.882
along with his lieutenant, Henry Lee.

12
00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:14.224
Whoa.

13
00:04:50.733 --> 00:04:52.969
- Fuck you.
- Hey.


14
00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.763
Learned some English. Good for you.

15
00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:02.481
What the fuck?

16
00:06:05.683 --> 00:06:07.754
English?

17
00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.922
Good. What do they call you?

18
00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:12.173
Jack.

19
00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:13.633
I can't hear you.

20
00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:15.927
- Jack.
- Jack.


21
00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:19.222
Tell Bobby Vu his time is running out
in Chinatown.


22
00:06:56.317 --> 00:07:00.304
In the history of the 15th Precinct,
few officers have done more...


23
00:07:00.404 --> 00:07:03.433
to serve and protect the public
of this great city...


24
00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:05.810
than Lieutenant Nicholas Chen.

25
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.190
Lieutenant, for bravery in the line
of fire and for bringing to justice...


26
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.110
those responsible
for the Chinatown bombings...


27
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.195
the people of New York thank you...

28
00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:18.450
and present you with this commendation.

29
00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:27.310
Let your brothers die?

30
00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:31.687
Let your brothers die?

31
00:08:31.787 --> 00:08:33.481
- Sorry.
- Are you Fukienese Dragon?


32
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:35.819
Yeah. I'm Fukienese Dragon.

33
00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:39.737
Avenge your brothers, okay?

34
00:08:39.837 --> 00:08:41.741
Kill that cop.

35
00:09:10.368 --> 00:09:12.564
No, no, no, you better tell him.

36
00:09:27.593 --> 00:09:29.245
Everybody works tonight.

37
00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:31.372
We are visiting Ginzu Massage.

38
00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:32.915
My kind of raid.

39
00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:36.045
Found another young pretty
in a dumpster.


40
00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:42.719
Anybody I know?

41
00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:46.137
Did a two-hour sweep.
No one would speak to me.


42
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:48.306
- Try breath mints.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


43
00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:52.184
And the two who found the body say
they didn't see, hear or smell anything.


44
00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:54.314
- What's new?
- Hi.


45
00:09:56.247 --> 00:09:58.651
I'm Daniel Wallace.

46
00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.155
I was assigned to this unit.

47
00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:09.327
The Chinese don't trust whites or cops.
And you're giving me a white cop?


48
00:10:09.427 --> 00:10:11.787
Hey, you've been squawking
about more manpower?


49
00:10:11.887 --> 00:10:14.292
They want more ethnic diversity
in each squad. Bing.


50
00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:16.709
You get a white face in AGU.

51
00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:19.172
He's worse than white. He's green.

52
00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:23.382
- Good. You school him, then.
- So he can get me killed?


53
00:10:23.482 --> 00:10:25.968
It's your fault he's here
in the first place.


54
00:10:26.068 --> 00:10:27.261
My fault?

55
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:29.889
A freaking tourist gets blown up
in our backyard...


56
00:10:29.989 --> 00:10:32.519
- ...and it was on your watch.
- Oh, yeah.


57
00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:35.853
Mayor's on television talking about it.

58
00:10:35.953 --> 00:10:39.065
Police commissioner's promising
safe streets in Chinatown.


59
00:10:39.165 --> 00:10:41.651
Christ, it was even on Nightline.

60
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:44.654
So if putting a white cop
in the Asian Gang Unit...


61
00:10:44.754 --> 00:10:47.657
makes them happy
and gets them off my back...


62
00:10:47.757 --> 00:10:49.408
fine and dandy.

63
00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:53.204
Get out of here. Do something about
those whores turning up in dumpsters.


64
00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:54.914
It's an embarrassment.

65
00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:00.421
You still here?

66
00:11:05.483 --> 00:11:07.885
Why does a white cop
request the Asian gang unit?


67
00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:10.721
Detective's shield,
extra 8 grand a year in my pocket...


68
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:12.556
the chance to work with you.

69
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:14.561
Yellow fever.

70
00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:18.270
You got a hard-on
for all things Chinese, right?


71
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.773
Food, customs, women?

72
00:11:20.873 --> 00:11:23.776
I bet you got a Chinese girlfriend,
don't you?


73
00:11:23.876 --> 00:11:26.322
- Actually, no, I don't.
- But you did.


74
00:11:28.565 --> 00:11:30.908
Are we all gonna exchange
our sexual histories here?


75
00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:35.705
I knew it. Yellow fucking fever.
Junior's here to walk the street...


76
00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:38.916
and get his wick licked
by a nice almond-eyed beauty.


77
00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:42.211
I'm here so Chinese immigrants
don't have to live 30 to a room...


78
00:11:42.311 --> 00:11:44.964
work 20 hours a day
making close to slave wages.


79
00:11:45.064 --> 00:11:48.676
Why do you give a shit
about the Chinese immigrants?


80
00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:52.012
I'm a cop. I give a shit
about enforcing the law. That's my job.


81
00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:54.515
So, what's your plan
to save the yellow people?


82
00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:58.060
Same techniques used in every
organized crime operation in the city.


83
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.438
Bust street soldiers every time
we see them.


84
00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:03.899
Work our way up the food chain to the
council, cramp them with surveillance...


85
00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:06.154
and keep climbing all the way
to Benjamin Wong.


86
00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:11.657
This ain't every other
organized crime operation.


87
00:12:11.757 --> 00:12:15.327
We work cases, junior.
Keep the tourists safe.


88
00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:17.665
Violence spills in the street,
we break heads.


89
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.374
You don't change Chinatown, boy.

90
00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:21.669
It changes you.

91
00:12:24.436 --> 00:12:27.717
Well, I'm ready to give it a shot.
That's why I'm here, sir.


92
00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:31.930
All right.

93
00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:34.641
Don't make plans tonight.

94
00:12:35.906 --> 00:12:37.725
Well, why not?

95
00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:40.521
Because we're going
on a panty raid. Oh!


96
00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:02.625
You never know how a guy getting
his dick rubbed is gonna react.


97
00:13:02.725 --> 00:13:04.835
Keep your eyes sharp
and your Glock cocked.


98
00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:07.630
And don't feel any Chinese titties,
you little pervert.


99
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.926
Hey, boy, stay out there.

100
00:13:18.908 --> 00:13:20.603
Police!

101
00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:27.399
- All right.
- We've got 18.


102
00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:30.279
- The place is secured.
- Hold on a second.


103
00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:33.866
Deng, see if you can find
any files back there.


104
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:37.660
John, take them down.
Wallace will help you. Come on.


105
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.328
Come on, ladies.

106
00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:40.873
Hey.

107
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:11.235
Hey, want me to take her for you?

108
00:14:11.335 --> 00:14:13.737
Always throw back
the smallest fish of the day.


109
00:14:13.837 --> 00:14:15.241
Let's go.

110
00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:20.527
Hey.

111
00:14:33.315 --> 00:14:35.386
Go!

112
00:14:41.824 --> 00:14:42.977
Fire your weapon!

113
00:14:47.788 --> 00:14:49.817
They're Fukienese!

114
00:15:47.514 --> 00:15:49.124
I'm out on three!

115
00:15:49.224 --> 00:15:52.130
One, two, three!

116
00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:00.721
Stop!

117
00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:24.996
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

118
00:16:28.514 --> 00:16:30.793
Hands to the wall.

119
00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:34.589
You stupid Fukienese!

120
00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:42.680
You're late.

121
00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:45.639
- Ung.
- Let me get this.


122
00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:47.059
Get me the car.

123
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.495
Bobby Vu.

124
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.832
Hey.

125
00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.853
You want some? Want some?

126
00:17:32.995 --> 00:17:34.897
Fukienese Dragon.

127
00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:10.226
Beef intestine noodles. Want some?

128
00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:12.684
No.

129
00:18:12.784 --> 00:18:15.982
Wanna be a Chinese,
you gotta eat the nasty stuff.


130
00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:20.069
You saved my life last night.

131
00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:22.152
Part of my job.

132
00:18:22.252 --> 00:18:24.907
Hey, man, I still wanna say thanks.

133
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.454
That said, I heard you paid a visit
to Bobby Vu.


134
00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:36.669
Look, I tightened up, but I didn't find my
badge in a Cracker Jack box. I earned it.


135
00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:40.673
You study Chinese, so you know
what it means that I saved your life.


136
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.466
It means my life is yours to do with
as you wish.


137
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:50.099
That's right. So here's my advice:
quit before you end up dead.


138
00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:55.938
If you don't wanna work with me, fine.
Let me do my own investigation.


139
00:18:56.078 --> 00:18:58.522
Just don't keep me from doing my work.
I'm a cop.


140
00:18:58.622 --> 00:19:00.526
You, a cop?

141
00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:02.234
You're playing cop.

142
00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:03.735
Playing?

143
00:19:03.835 --> 00:19:07.406
Playing's driving past shit
pretending you didn't even see it.


144
00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:09.118
That's what playing is.

145
00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:14.373
You got something to say? Say it.

146
00:19:15.597 --> 00:19:16.874
Why don't I show you?

147
00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:27.261
Cops! Get out of here!

148
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.104
Police, freeze!

149
00:19:40.122 --> 00:19:41.231
Freeze!

150
00:19:50.007 --> 00:19:51.702
What do we have here?

151
00:19:54.344 --> 00:19:57.666
Hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.


152
00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:06.467
FBI. I want each one of these guys
in different rooms, now.


153
00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:11.762
Each guy in different rooms, right now!

154
00:20:11.862 --> 00:20:13.891
- Let's go.
- Can I talk to you, please?


155
00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:24.900
What's up, Pete?

156
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.238
Oh. Nothing. Only that you assholes
just arrested a federal agent...


157
00:20:29.338 --> 00:20:31.198
working undercover with the Tongs.

158
00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:32.618
Nice work, junior.

159
00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:34.370
I made the arrest.

160
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.620
Well, goody for you.

161
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.124
So tell me, Einstein,
what am I supposed to do now?


162
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:44.795
What do I do?

163
00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:48.131
Put a federal agent in jail
to maintain his cover? What do I do?


164
00:20:48.231 --> 00:20:50.553
What do I do? Let him go?

165
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:55.555
We put him back on the street, everyone
will think he cut a deal with you...


166
00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:57.474
and he'll be dead inside an hour.

167
00:20:57.574 --> 00:21:00.978
- So, what should I do?
- Do a better job of keeping us informed.


168
00:21:01.078 --> 00:21:03.063
- Hear, hear.
- Oh, right.


169
00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:07.859
Confidential undercover assignment.
Key word being "confidential"...


170
00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:11.824
which nothing in this

171
00:21:12.631 --> 00:21:14.324
Relax, Pete.

172
00:21:14.424 --> 00:21:17.286
We lost the drugs, no evidence.

173
00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:19.331
They can all go.

174
00:21:25.477 --> 00:21:29.673
All right, all right. Keep them three hours,
slap the shit out of them, let them go.


175
00:21:29.773 --> 00:21:34.346
I want everything on the raid by the end
of the day. Keep that dipshit on a leash.


176
00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:39.226
You take care of your people,
I'll take care of mine.


177
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:40.600
Which one's FBI?

178
00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:44.106
The Chinese one.

179
00:21:44.538 --> 00:21:47.234
You wanna eat this with soy sauce?

180
00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:59.328
Hey, cough up the cash, junior.

181
00:21:59.428 --> 00:22:01.248
Knuckleheads buy all rounds.

182
00:22:01.638 --> 00:22:03.209
Blow me.

183
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.710
That's it.
Show a little piss and vinegar.


184
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.212
So your first bust
was a federal agent...


185
00:22:09.312 --> 00:22:12.257
and a senior fed
bit off a giant piece of your ass.


186
00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:20.184
So why did the FBI want the info
on the Ginzu raid?


187
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.643
It was their raid.

188
00:22:23.743 --> 00:22:26.730
They use us
so nobody knows it's the FBI.


189
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.858
Mostly, they use us
because they are lazy shits.


190
00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.152
Last summer,
we grabbed a Vietnamese gang...


191
00:22:32.252 --> 00:22:34.279
bringing in heroin by the boatload.

192
00:22:34.379 --> 00:22:36.740
Who swoops in last minute
to get the credit?


193
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.409
Your friend Schabacker of the FBI.

194
00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:43.246
Now they have agent working
undercover inside the Tongs.


195
00:22:43.346 --> 00:22:46.708
We find the agent,
see what he's got going.


196
00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:48.919
When the time is right,
we make the bust...


197
00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:51.840
and pull the case
right out from under them.


198
00:23:00.655 --> 00:23:02.557
You speak Chinese?

199
00:23:02.657 --> 00:23:05.062
Doesn't everybody in Chinatown?

200
00:23:05.702 --> 00:23:08.107
Danny Wallace, Henry Lee.

201
00:23:08.455 --> 00:23:10.150
You gentlemen are partners?

202
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.028
Are we?

203
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:16.446
Cagney and Lacey.

204
00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:19.950
Chinatown needs more police.

205
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.952
I hope you find a home here.

206
00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:25.624
I think you'll discover that Chinese
people are warm and generous.


207
00:23:25.889 --> 00:23:28.043
I hope to see much of you
in the coming weeks.


208
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.296
Enjoy.

209
00:23:33.897 --> 00:23:35.173
He's Tong.

210
00:23:35.273 --> 00:23:40.681
That's why it's Cristal
and not Asti-fucking-Spumanti.


211
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.866
Henry.

212
00:23:59.005 --> 00:24:03.201
It is very dangerous
to approach a white policeman.


213
00:24:03.301 --> 00:24:07.497
We cannot risk exposing our other ties
in the department.


214
00:24:07.597 --> 00:24:11.462
That's why, uncle,
we must approach Wallace.


215
00:24:11.851 --> 00:24:13.380
He could compromise Chen...

216
00:24:13.812 --> 00:24:17.799
at a time when he's our best weapon
against the Fukes.


217
00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:23.098
We need him with us
to safeguard Chen's position.


218
00:24:23.363 --> 00:24:27.809
Besides, to the N.Y.P.D.,
Chen is Chinese first and a cop second.


219
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:30.896
Chen can take care of himself.
He knows what we need of him.


220
00:24:30.996 --> 00:24:33.732
He knows what he hears in the 15th.

221
00:24:33.832 --> 00:24:37.652
A white officer would have ears
outside the precinct.


222
00:24:37.752 --> 00:24:40.324
We could let Chen test the waters.

223
00:25:05.405 --> 00:25:08.808
- What do you want?
- I liked your partner.


224
00:25:08.908 --> 00:25:10.562
I think he could help us.

225
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.106
He could hurt us more.

226
00:25:12.662 --> 00:25:14.481
Afraid of competition?

227
00:25:14.581 --> 00:25:16.483
Afraid of piquing the kid's interest...

228
00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:19.236
In who else is a dirty cop.

229
00:25:22.339 --> 00:25:27.621
Uncle Benny feels he might poke his
nose in places a Chinese cop wouldn't.


230
00:25:28.553 --> 00:25:30.622
I can handle him.

231
00:25:30.722 --> 00:25:34.876
He also feels he might be an asset
against the Fukes...


232
00:25:34.976 --> 00:25:39.256
since you don't seem to be doing much?

233
00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:45.262
I will take care of the Fukes.

234
00:25:45.362 --> 00:25:48.348
The kid's a short-time.
Leave him alone.


235
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:54.062
I didn't realize
you had such maternal instincts.


236
00:25:56.122 --> 00:25:59.153
Uncle Benny wants you
to speak with him.


237
00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:01.780
No.

238
00:26:06.341 --> 00:26:08.577
This costs $1 to make...

239
00:26:08.677 --> 00:26:11.871
and some fool will pay hundreds for it.

240
00:26:11.971 --> 00:26:17.502
It's amazing how easy it is
for some people to overestimate worth.


241
00:26:17.602 --> 00:26:19.296
Don't overestimate yours.

242
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:23.010
Talk to him.

243
00:26:48.675 --> 00:26:51.328
- Who's in the bin?
- The invisible woman.


244
00:26:51.428 --> 00:26:54.583
No ID, no prints, no nothing.

245
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.593
- Thought you liked Chinese food, junior.
- Shut up.


246
00:27:06.693 --> 00:27:10.472
- Let's go. I need about 50 coffees.
- What, we're not gonna investigate this?


247
00:27:10.572 --> 00:27:13.852
- We just did.
- What? What are you talking about?


248
00:27:14.075 --> 00:27:15.935
Tell our partner what we learned.

249
00:27:16.035 --> 00:27:19.189
Deceased is an illegal,
straight off the boat. Less than a week.


250
00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:22.192
There's two bills Chinese
under the oysters, by her spleen.


251
00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:25.111
She finds her passage over
was twice what she thought.


252
00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:28.948
She can't pay and doesn't like working
as a prostitute, so she ends up here.


253
00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:31.284
No family, no friends, no witnesses.

254
00:27:31.384 --> 00:27:34.331
No sense wasting taxpayers' money.

255
00:27:35.263 --> 00:27:36.500
What, so case closed?

256
00:27:37.766 --> 00:27:40.710
Take a walk with Deng.
See if anybody knows anything.


257
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.256
Sure.

258
00:27:43.605 --> 00:27:45.300
Let's go.

259
00:27:54.115 --> 00:27:56.812
- Careful.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.


260
00:28:25.104 --> 00:28:27.757
- What the fuck, man?
- Easy, Jackarroo.


261
00:28:27.857 --> 00:28:31.720
Chen is now able to identify the shooter
who got away from the lamp store.


262
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.013
Unless you can do something for me.

263
00:28:34.113 --> 00:28:35.807
I want Bobby Vu.

264
00:28:35.907 --> 00:28:37.183
He'd kill me.

265
00:28:37.283 --> 00:28:40.437
The alternative to helping us
is 10 to 20 at Sing Sing.


266
00:28:40.537 --> 00:28:41.813
And that's gotta hurt...

267
00:28:41.913 --> 00:28:45.358
especially for somebody 98 pounds
soaking wet.


268
00:28:45.458 --> 00:28:49.114
- No court, no wire?
- No promises.


269
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.905
Think about it.

270
00:28:51.005 --> 00:28:54.161
You got 10 seconds
to make up your mind.


271
00:28:55.593 --> 00:28:59.164
- Five, four, three...
- Fuck you.


272
00:28:59.264 --> 00:29:00.626
- ...two...
- Unh.


273
00:29:01.724 --> 00:29:03.712
Kid's loyal.

274
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:08.258
See how loyal he is
after two weeks in lockup.


275
00:30:10.543 --> 00:30:13.740
- Could've killed you.
- Could've killed you first.


276
00:30:14.047 --> 00:30:17.116
- What are you doing here?
- Father can't visit his son?


277
00:30:17.216 --> 00:30:20.995
Got something to drink?
I'm as dry as a 90-year-old tit.


278
00:30:21.095 --> 00:30:22.958
How'd you get in?

279
00:30:24.307 --> 00:30:26.376
Twenty years Robbery and Homicide.

280
00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:30.672
Out of the two-five, greenhorn.
That's how I got in.


281
00:30:30.772 --> 00:30:34.386
- I've been through more windows...
- I don't have any money.


282
00:30:39.322 --> 00:30:42.853
I'm in for 12 grand.
Those fucking dagos down on Mulberry.


283
00:30:43.368 --> 00:30:47.021
- Good luck.
- I'm not asking for the 12.


284
00:30:47.121 --> 00:30:50.525
God forbid you should bail me out
with your lawyer money.


285
00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:53.613
I wouldn't want you to miss out
on becoming a leech, asshole.


286
00:30:54.837 --> 00:30:58.074
And here I thought you'd want me
to be a chip off the old block.


287
00:30:58.174 --> 00:31:01.955
All I'm asking for is a little
stake money to get me even.


288
00:31:03.137 --> 00:31:05.498
Wouldn't work. 
Too much of a loser.

289
00:31:05.598 --> 00:31:07.169
Then we'll go partners.

290
00:31:09.102 --> 00:31:12.424
You was always a
lucky son of a bitch?

291
00:31:24.242 --> 00:31:26.855
I wouldn't be here
if this wasn't serious.


292
00:31:55.231 --> 00:31:57.427
Cold, hard cash. You slay me.

293
00:31:57.984 --> 00:32:00.803
There's a little over 500 there,
and we're not partners.


294
00:32:00.903 --> 00:32:03.514
That's to buy you off.
Next time you sneak up on me...


295
00:32:03.614 --> 00:32:06.728
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
You'll kill me?


296
00:32:08.286 --> 00:32:10.148
By the way...

297
00:32:10.955 --> 00:32:15.403
there's a Chink watching you
from across the street, Sherlock.


298
00:32:18.171 --> 00:32:20.242
Good night, officer.

299
00:32:23.634 --> 00:32:25.288
Yeah, you're welcome.

300
00:32:42.361 --> 00:32:44.182
I got something for you.

301
00:32:44.697 --> 00:32:47.266
I love gifts.

302
00:32:47.366 --> 00:32:50.522
This isn't free. 
Forget the kid.

303
00:32:51.537 --> 00:32:53.564
That's an expensive request.

304
00:32:53.664 --> 00:32:56.403
This is an expensive item.

305
00:32:57.627 --> 00:32:59.278
Let's hear it.

306
00:32:59.378 --> 00:33:01.658
The FBI have an informant
inside the Tong.


307
00:33:02.507 --> 00:33:05.910
This time, it's one of their own.

308
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.581
It's an agent.

309
00:33:07.887 --> 00:33:11.124
- Who is it?
- Don't know.


310
00:33:11.224 --> 00:33:14.963
We picked up four of your guys,
and one was a fed.


311
00:33:15.228 --> 00:33:17.924
It won't take long
to find out which one.


312
00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:20.925
And all you gotta do
is blow his cover...


313
00:33:21.025 --> 00:33:22.468
and they'll pull him.

314
00:33:22.568 --> 00:33:24.973
No violence, no mess.

315
00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:27.225
My thanks.

316
00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:29.477
The kid is out.

317
00:33:31.702 --> 00:33:33.273
As you wish.

318
00:33:44.507 --> 00:33:46.620
Would you like May
to give you a grape?

319
00:34:00.064 --> 00:34:02.633
We need to delay the start
of our new partnership.


320
00:34:02.733 --> 00:34:05.639
We've got a federal agent
sniffing around.


321
00:34:08.156 --> 00:34:10.641
I have to postpone delivery.

322
00:34:10.741 --> 00:34:12.687
We can't.

323
00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:16.274
The boat's coming into port next week.

324
00:34:17.373 --> 00:34:19.736
It'll wait at the port.

325
00:34:20.209 --> 00:34:21.986
I'm not afraid of the FBI.

326
00:34:22.086 --> 00:34:25.490
Everything we've done has been
to keep the feds' focus on Uncle Benny.


327
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.202
When he's gone and I lead the Tongs,
you'll make all the money you want.


328
00:34:29.302 --> 00:34:31.122
Let's kill him now.

329
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:35.208
When Uncle Benny's indicted, he'll be
a danger to our partners in Hong Kong.


330
00:34:35.308 --> 00:34:39.754
Killing him then will come with thanks
instead of retribution.


331
00:34:39.854 --> 00:34:42.300
We kill Chen too.

332
00:34:43.566 --> 00:34:45.845
All in good time.

333
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:57.482
Do you remember me?

334
00:34:58.206 --> 00:34:59.715
Yeah.

335
00:35:00.352 --> 00:35:04.239
I have information about the girl
you found in the garbage dumpster.


336
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.868
- How'd you find me?
- You're conspicuous in Chinatown.


337
00:35:09.175 --> 00:35:11.869
Two brothers on Chrystie Street
bring in illegals.


338
00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:14.539
That girl worked in their brothel,
then tried to run.


339
00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:17.583
They left her as a message
to the others.


340
00:35:17.683 --> 00:35:20.294
- How do you know?
- Everyone knows.


341
00:35:20.394 --> 00:35:23.047
No one is going to speak of it,
especially to police.


342
00:35:23.147 --> 00:35:25.007
So why are you?

343
00:35:25.107 --> 00:35:27.053
I knew her.

344
00:35:28.236 --> 00:35:33.099
- What are their names?
- You can't tell anyone, not even Chen.


345
00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:36.102
- Forget it. I can't do that.
- For every person who knows...


346
00:35:36.202 --> 00:35:38.563
the chances of me
being killed in reprisal...


347
00:35:38.663 --> 00:35:41.067
increases a hundredfold.

348
00:35:42.458 --> 00:35:44.777
The girl was 15.

349
00:35:44.877 --> 00:35:47.949
And there are more to come
if you don't help us.


350
00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:51.784
Check out the basement of a place
called Tony's.


351
00:35:51.884 --> 00:35:55.206
Don't worry. This is how things
get done in Chinatown.


352
00:36:07.483 --> 00:36:09.093
The boy come in yet?

353
00:36:09.193 --> 00:36:11.348
Not that I've seen.

354
00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.999
Police, freeze!

355
00:38:54.024 --> 00:38:55.720
Freeze!

356
00:38:56.819 --> 00:38:58.681
I said, freeze!

357
00:39:07.204 --> 00:39:09.190
What were you doing in here?

358
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:13.152
I was coming out of the diner on Pell
and I saw this guy snatch a purse...


359
00:39:13.252 --> 00:39:16.822
so I chased him into the building.
I lost him as soon as I got inside.


360
00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:20.826
Then I heard some screaming from down
here and I just kind of stumbled onto it.


361
00:39:20.926 --> 00:39:23.287
We got close to 40 women here,
all illegals...


362
00:39:23.387 --> 00:39:25.456
and we found about a hundred tapes.

363
00:39:25.556 --> 00:39:29.043
Landlord remembers the four Jane Does
we pulled out of the dumpsters...


364
00:39:29.143 --> 00:39:30.586
were part of the stable.

365
00:39:30.686 --> 00:39:32.380
- Good job, officer.
- Thanks.


366
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.965
- Attaboy, Wallace.
- Yeah, way to go.


367
00:39:35.065 --> 00:39:37.760
- Wallace.
- Good job.


368
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.846
For bravery in the line of fire,
the people of New York...


369
00:39:40.946 --> 00:39:43.851
thank you and present you
with this commendation.


370
00:39:46.494 --> 00:39:49.357
- Way to go.
- Hey.


371
00:40:08.641 --> 00:40:10.501
It's dick size.

372
00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:13.421
- You think everything is dick size?
- It is.


373
00:40:13.521 --> 00:40:17.091
White people believe
all Asians got little dicks.


374
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.846
So you think that when an Asian chick
sees your pecker...


375
00:40:21.946 --> 00:40:24.432
she's gonna think
it's Mount St. Helens.


376
00:40:27.868 --> 00:40:29.228
It's true.

377
00:40:29.328 --> 00:40:33.190
And then you look at the tiny hands
on most Asian chicks...


378
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:38.604
and figure your weenie's gonna look
like a sewer pipe in her fist.


379
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.765
He's discovered my secret.

380
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.535
Well, the joke's on you...

381
00:40:44.635 --> 00:40:47.997
because this Chinaman's hung
like a fucking...


382
00:40:48.097 --> 00:40:49.832
Gnat.

383
00:40:49.932 --> 00:40:53.713
You wanna see? 
You wanna see?

384
00:40:54.103 --> 00:40:57.175
- Hey, hey, come on, put that thing away.
- No, no. Sit down.


385
00:40:58.357 --> 00:41:00.676
That's my cue.
I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow.


386
00:41:00.776 --> 00:41:03.888
Eight sharp. We gotta put a tag
on those guys you busted...


387
00:41:03.988 --> 00:41:06.390
find out which one is the FBI agent.

388
00:41:09.243 --> 00:41:11.729
And I remember you
and me used to spend

389
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:16.486
The whole goddamned day in bed

390
00:41:17.084 --> 00:41:19.069
Losing a whole year

391
00:41:19.169 --> 00:41:21.074
Hey, Wallace.

392
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.911
You did a lot for those women
down there. You did a good job.


393
00:41:25.467 --> 00:41:28.581
- Thanks.
- But it was an accident.


394
00:41:29.013 --> 00:41:31.542
You are lucky you are not dead.

395
00:41:32.182 --> 00:41:36.464
So don't you ever go off alone again.

396
00:42:03.505 --> 00:42:06.119
Congratulations, Danny.

397
00:42:07.134 --> 00:42:11.082
- Thanks. Look, I gotta...
- You must allow me to buy you a drink.


398
00:42:12.556 --> 00:42:14.667
- I gotta go.
- You've done a great thing...


399
00:42:14.767 --> 00:42:16.585
for the people of this community.

400
00:42:16.685 --> 00:42:19.463
Let me thank you,
as a show of respect.

401
00:42:19.563 --> 00:42:21.259
Please.

402
00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:06.864
- Shit.
- I tried to, but I never made it.


403
00:44:07.755 --> 00:44:09.782
- Pop, we gotta get you to a hospital.
- No time.


404
00:44:11.467 --> 00:44:15.871
- Shit, you're bleeding inside, Pop.
- Oh, well, wouldn't be surprised.


405
00:44:15.971 --> 00:44:17.665
I need the money.

406
00:44:17.765 --> 00:44:21.168
- I don't have that kind of money, Pop.
- How much you got?


407
00:44:21.268 --> 00:44:23.128
I don't know. A grand at most.

408
00:44:25.981 --> 00:44:27.466
Shit.

409
00:44:27.566 --> 00:44:29.051
Shit. Come on, again.

410
00:44:29.151 --> 00:44:32.306
- Come on, this way.
- No. Hey, hey.


411
00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.890
Would you give it to
me if you had it?

412
00:44:36.867 --> 00:44:39.397
No, I don't think I could, Pop.

413
00:44:39.578 --> 00:44:42.815
Fucking honest, just like your mother.

414
00:44:42.915 --> 00:44:44.983
Oh, screw it, then.

415
00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:47.236
Might as well go to the hospital.

416
00:44:47.336 --> 00:44:48.487
Come on.

417
00:44:48.587 --> 00:44:50.280
We'll get you there.

418
00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.201
Come on. Get up.

419
00:44:53.509 --> 00:44:56.161
What's going on?
Figure out which one's the FBI agent?


420
00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:59.331
- If he's there, we haven't seen him.
- You better get in there.


421
00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:01.083
He's fucking pissed at you.

422
00:45:01.183 --> 00:45:02.962
What's new?

423
00:45:07.022 --> 00:45:09.176
- You are late.
- Sorry about that.


424
00:45:13.195 --> 00:45:16.767
My old man fell last night.
I had to take him to the hospital.


425
00:45:17.074 --> 00:45:20.310
- Took all night to get him there?
- Well, he fell last night...


426
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.858
but I didn't find him till this morning.
He was in the bathroom.


427
00:45:27.251 --> 00:45:30.904
- Looks like he scratched you.
- Yeah, well, I was carrying him.


428
00:45:31.004 --> 00:45:34.660
- He all right?
- Yeah. He should be fine.


429
00:45:36.677 --> 00:45:38.789
He was a cop, right?

430
00:45:39.137 --> 00:45:40.666
Yeah, in the two-five.

431
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.791
Tough beat.

432
00:45:42.891 --> 00:45:46.044
Is that why you're here?
Prove something to your old man?


433
00:45:46.144 --> 00:45:47.924
No, why, is that why you're here?

434
00:45:49.606 --> 00:45:51.383
My old man's dead.

435
00:45:51.483 --> 00:45:53.844
I don't have to prove anything
to anybody.


436
00:45:53.944 --> 00:45:57.016
- How about you?
- Just to you, I guess.


437
00:45:58.031 --> 00:46:00.102
That's for sure.

438
00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:03.481
Why do you have to constantly
break my balls?


439
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:08.444
I'm educating you well this time.

440
00:46:09.585 --> 00:46:11.820
Do you mean you care about me?

441
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.700
I don't know what to say.

442
00:46:15.132 --> 00:46:16.658
Try nothing.

443
00:46:16.758 --> 00:46:18.368
Oh, but I'm overwhelmed.

444
00:46:18.468 --> 00:46:21.624
I mean, I had no idea
that you felt this way about me, it's...


445
00:46:22.055 --> 00:46:25.294
I mean, it's just very kind
and warm and...


446
00:46:26.977 --> 00:46:30.675
Hey, check this out.
These guys don't look like junkies.


447
00:46:43.327 --> 00:46:45.564
- You got pictures?
- Not all of them.


448
00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:51.153
- Shit!
- Shit.


449
00:47:00.761 --> 00:47:02.957
Police!

450
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.902
Meet me with the car!

451
00:47:53.647 --> 00:47:55.342
Come on, boy!

452
00:47:57.859 --> 00:48:00.095
This is Car 7 in the green sector.

453
00:48:00.195 --> 00:48:02.890
We're in pursuit of a burgundy Cadillac.
Jersey plates.


454
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:05.934
Five-nine-five
-Alpha
-Alpha
-Zulu...

455
00:48:06.034 --> 00:48:09.146
traveling south on Park Row.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.


456
00:48:09.246 --> 00:48:11.692
Requesting roadblock units
on all lanes.


457
00:48:19.089 --> 00:48:21.116
All green units, 10-85.

458
00:48:21.216 --> 00:48:22.618
All green units, 10-85.

459
00:48:22.718 --> 00:48:26.038
Burgundy Cadillac traveling south
on Park Row.


460
00:48:26.138 --> 00:48:28.290
Suspects armed and dangerous.

461
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.956
Hey!

462
00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.477
Nick, right there!

463
00:50:52.576 --> 00:50:53.685
Chen, watch out!

464
00:51:40.415 --> 00:51:41.694
Hold on!

465
00:51:47.763 --> 00:51:48.784
Damn it.

466
00:51:52.135 --> 00:51:55.664
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah!


467
00:52:06.566 --> 00:52:09.680
Go! I said, go!

468
00:52:45.397 --> 00:52:47.885
- You all right?
- You?


469
00:52:58.868 --> 00:53:01.354
Six innocent bystanders...

470
00:53:01.454 --> 00:53:04.065
dozens of cars...

471
00:53:04.165 --> 00:53:07.194
millions in property, all destroyed.

472
00:53:07.294 --> 00:53:08.781
Not to mention...

473
00:53:10.338 --> 00:53:13.327
Federal Agent Ronald Ming is dead.

474
00:53:14.092 --> 00:53:17.204
Shot seven times in the back.

475
00:53:17.304 --> 00:53:21.917
And I'm thinking some scumbag
in the 15th is responsible.


476
00:53:22.017 --> 00:53:24.419
Maybe some scumbag in the bureau
is responsible.


477
00:53:24.519 --> 00:53:26.630
Maybe I'm gonna grow
a tree out of my dick.


478
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:30.427
- If anybody could...
- You bet your ass, it'd be an oak.


479
00:53:34.279 --> 00:53:35.724
They ID'd the shooters.

480
00:53:37.282 --> 00:53:38.644
They're Fukienese.

481
00:53:39.951 --> 00:53:42.437
Fukes have been making a move
on Tongs for months.


482
00:53:42.537 --> 00:53:44.272
That's the only thing keeping me...

483
00:53:44.372 --> 00:53:46.942
from ripping this
fucking precinct to the ground.


484
00:53:47.042 --> 00:53:50.447
That and this.

485
00:53:52.422 --> 00:53:54.658
Assholes were
in such a hurry to get moving...


486
00:53:54.758 --> 00:53:57.079
they didn't check the bodies for wires.

487
00:53:58.595 --> 00:54:00.374
Who's on it?

488
00:54:01.931 --> 00:54:03.710
Benny Wong.

489
00:54:04.893 --> 00:54:06.755
A few others.

490
00:54:08.063 --> 00:54:09.883
Three weeks' worth of undercover work.

491
00:54:14.027 --> 00:54:17.222
A court would never admit it
without the agent backing it up.


492
00:54:17.322 --> 00:54:19.140
Yeah, they will...

493
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.769
once you tell them you've been
working with us on this investigation.


494
00:54:22.869 --> 00:54:27.899
That after the shooting and before
the chase, you entered the building.


495
00:54:27.999 --> 00:54:30.568
You approached our agent,
who with his last breath...


496
00:54:30.668 --> 00:54:34.948
told you that he got this tape
and corroborated what's on it.


497
00:54:37.342 --> 00:54:39.202
That's perjury.

498
00:54:39.302 --> 00:54:40.620
Why would I do that?

499
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.080
Why?

500
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.833
Well, to keep me
from bringing charges against you...


501
00:54:44.933 --> 00:54:47.713
for obstructing
a federal investigation.


502
00:54:48.144 --> 00:54:50.380
Oh, yeah. Wallace told us...

503
00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.050
how you engaged in the unauthorized
surveillance of a federal agent...


504
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:57.848
which possibly blew his cover,
resulting in his assassination.


505
00:54:58.822 --> 00:55:01.894
That speech
may have shivered a rookie...


506
00:55:02.033 --> 00:55:03.852
but you need better for me.

507
00:55:03.952 --> 00:55:06.521
Yeah? I'll tell you what.
You better watch your back.


508
00:55:06.621 --> 00:55:09.607
My guts still tell me somebody
in the 15th gave my guy up.


509
00:55:09.707 --> 00:55:12.613
If I can't have Uncle Benny,
I'm gonna fucking have him.


510
00:55:17.424 --> 00:55:19.328
Mr. Chen.

511
00:55:21.636 --> 00:55:23.499
Come on. Let's go.

512
00:55:30.645 --> 00:55:32.382
Yeah?

513
00:55:37.235 --> 00:55:38.764
Hey.

514
00:55:40.738 --> 00:55:43.808
- You alone?
- Yeah.


515
00:55:43.908 --> 00:55:45.896
Then ask me in.

516
00:55:46.786 --> 00:55:48.480
You wanna come in?

517
00:55:54.002 --> 00:55:55.489
What's going on?

518
00:55:56.671 --> 00:56:00.452
- You got something to drink?
- No.


519
00:56:01.509 --> 00:56:03.664
Well, I haven't gone shopping yet.

520
00:56:08.016 --> 00:56:11.922
About yesterday,
you saved my life out there.


521
00:56:12.312 --> 00:56:14.466
It's part of the job.

522
00:56:15.231 --> 00:56:16.885
Maybe...

523
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.055
but I still want to say thank you.

524
00:56:22.322 --> 00:56:25.435
You know what it means
now that I saved your life, right?


525
00:56:29.078 --> 00:56:30.522
This is America.

526
00:56:30.622 --> 00:56:32.693
It doesn't mean anything.

527
00:56:33.958 --> 00:56:37.864
So feds getting you nervous?

528
00:56:38.338 --> 00:56:40.115
No, not at all.

529
00:56:40.215 --> 00:56:41.702
Good.

530
00:56:41.925 --> 00:56:46.456
Because whether it's the feds,
Internal Affairs, whoever...


531
00:56:46.804 --> 00:56:49.582
the inside of a cop car is sacred.

532
00:56:49.682 --> 00:56:53.711
You don't tell them what we do
unless you come to me first.


533
00:56:53.811 --> 00:56:55.591
Why the sudden paranoia?

534
00:56:56.356 --> 00:56:58.552
I'm just saying,
no more talking with the feds...


535
00:56:58.983 --> 00:57:01.428
until we are working off the same page.

536
00:57:01.528 --> 00:57:02.931
Yeah, sure.

537
00:57:03.655 --> 00:57:05.142
Good.

538
00:57:13.206 --> 00:57:15.444
Do you even have water?

539
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:16.987
Regular water, yeah.

540
00:57:17.585 --> 00:57:18.864
Please.

541
00:57:21.089 --> 00:57:22.659
Thank you.

542
00:57:52.745 --> 00:57:55.150
Nice-looking girl.

543
00:58:00.253 --> 00:58:03.575
Do you know she's in the country
illegally?


544
00:58:06.551 --> 00:58:09.039
Gonna have to send her back...

545
00:58:09.887 --> 00:58:13.502
after a little jail time, of course.

546
00:58:14.267 --> 00:58:17.506
Shame you two
will never see each other again.


547
00:58:18.396 --> 00:58:20.173
You can't send her.

548
00:58:20.273 --> 00:58:22.511
She's in trouble there.

549
00:58:23.026 --> 00:58:25.011
She'll be sent to prison.

550
00:58:25.111 --> 00:58:27.015
Too bad.

551
00:58:28.573 --> 00:58:30.644
I can't help you.

552
00:58:31.868 --> 00:58:34.606
That's what you told me, isn't it?

553
00:58:36.164 --> 00:58:39.692
I help you when they move me.

554
00:58:39.792 --> 00:58:43.156
She comes too, with papers.

555
00:58:48.051 --> 00:58:49.911
My pager number.

556
00:58:50.011 --> 00:58:53.917
Punch one one after your number
so I know it's you.


557
00:58:56.684 --> 00:58:58.920
I get you out...

558
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.633
you better not run on me.

559
00:59:04.776 --> 00:59:09.931
I want whoever shot that undercover fed
on this tape.


560
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:15.021
And I want to know
if he talks to Henry Lee.


561
00:59:44.982 --> 00:59:46.676
Dr. Bergen to ICU west.

562
00:59:46.776 --> 00:59:49.389
Dr. Bergen to ICU west.

563
00:59:59.455 --> 01:00:00.776
Hey.

564
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.946
Thank you.

565
01:00:06.504 --> 01:00:09.701
For the money. 
They sent a guy.

566
01:00:11.342 --> 01:00:14.831
You must've really put something
on the line.


567
01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:18.335
I'm not gonna forget that.

568
01:00:28.317 --> 01:00:30.511
- Hello, officer.
- Did you cover my father?


569
01:00:30.611 --> 01:00:33.433
- Tea?
- I asked you a question.


570
01:00:33.906 --> 01:00:36.934
I want to help you
because I want you to help me.


571
01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:39.147
What do you mean, help you?

572
01:00:39.987 --> 01:00:41.898
My business is victimless.

573
01:00:41.998 --> 01:00:46.071
I supply services people want
and are forbidden to them by politicians.


574
01:00:46.544 --> 01:00:49.364
However, there are those
whose business is not victimless...


575
01:00:49.464 --> 01:00:51.824
whose tactic is violence.

576
01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:54.452
I can help you rid Chinatown
of those elements...


577
01:00:54.552 --> 01:00:57.666
and help keep your father alive.

578
01:00:57.805 --> 01:01:02.337
All I ask is that you look out
for my interests in return.


579
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.757
I think you're asking
for more than that.


580
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.717
Long after you and I are gone...

581
01:01:09.817 --> 01:01:12.931
there will be gambling in Chinatown.

582
01:01:13.279 --> 01:01:17.934
There will be men
waiting to pay a woman for her favors.


583
01:01:18.034 --> 01:01:22.649
And the police will always be
the last to know. That's a fact.


584
01:01:23.206 --> 01:01:27.571
Now, you can chase your tail in the dark
and accomplish nothing...


585
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:31.116
or you can really do some good...

586
01:01:31.506 --> 01:01:34.200
for the people of Chinatown...

587
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.663
for your career...

588
01:01:36.844 --> 01:01:39.124
and for your father.

589
01:01:43.476 --> 01:01:46.879
Think of how many more young women
would have ended up in dumpsters...


590
01:01:46.979 --> 01:01:50.176
if not for your acceptance of my help.

591
01:01:56.864 --> 01:01:58.894
Do we have a deal?

592
01:02:00.076 --> 01:02:03.438
Or do you want me to call the Italians
and rescind my offer...


593
01:02:03.538 --> 01:02:06.401
and let them deal with your father?

594
01:02:12.338 --> 01:02:13.909
Good.

595
01:02:15.424 --> 01:02:18.121
There's something I'd like you to do
tomorrow morning.


596
01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:21.041
There's a tin shop on Mott.

597
01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:24.417
A Malaysian runs it.

598
01:02:24.517 --> 01:02:26.127
Tomorrow morning at 6 a.m...

599
01:02:26.227 --> 01:02:30.425
he'll be receiving two bricks
of heroin from a Colombian.


600
01:02:31.607 --> 01:02:35.096
These men are scum.
They deal to children.


601
01:02:36.362 --> 01:02:38.975
I want you to stop them.

602
01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:48.128
Freeze! Police!

603
01:03:57.443 --> 01:03:59.929
You son of a bitch.

604
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:01.973
When did Lee approach you?

605
01:04:02.073 --> 01:04:03.685
The bust from Chrystie, right?

606
01:04:04.283 --> 01:04:07.895
- Yeah.
- I knew your story was full of shit.


607
01:04:07.995 --> 01:04:11.357
When did he approach you?
I bet it was quite a while before that.


608
01:04:11.457 --> 01:04:13.568
When was it, two years ago,
five years ago?


609
01:04:13.668 --> 01:04:16.865
How long have you been working
for him, or can you even remember?


610
01:04:17.922 --> 01:04:19.532
You're dead.

611
01:04:19.632 --> 01:04:21.450
Your life is over.

612
01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:23.621
I thought you were smart,
but you're not.


613
01:04:25.221 --> 01:04:27.042
You're as dumb as they come.

614
01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.713
You gave him that FBI agent, didn't you?

615
01:04:32.645 --> 01:04:35.548
That's why you pressed that kid
so hard to wear the wire?


616
01:04:35.648 --> 01:04:38.595
You wanna know if the Fukes
killed that agent or Henry Lee.


617
01:04:48.786 --> 01:04:52.440
- We had a deal.
- You brought him in, not me.


618
01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.442
I couldn't risk it.

619
01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:57.069
- Let him go.
- What's done is done.


620
01:04:57.169 --> 01:04:59.280
You know that better than anyone.

621
01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.199
You want to help him? 
Smarten him up.

622
01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:06.203
Make sure he doesn't trip on his toes
and fuck both of you.


623
01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:09.417
I hear dirty cops have an extra
rough time of it in prison.


624
01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:19.177
I find out you killed the fed,
I'll kill you.


625
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:36.943
Black or red plum?

626
01:05:37.043 --> 01:05:38.277
I don't like plums.

627
01:05:38.377 --> 01:05:40.237
What do you mean, you don't like plums?

628
01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:43.282
- I like peaches.
- Peaches are shit.


629
01:05:43.382 --> 01:05:45.826
Haven't you ever heard the song
Sinatra sang?


630
01:05:45.926 --> 01:05:48.746
"Out of the tree of life,
I just picked me a plum."


631
01:05:48.846 --> 01:05:51.666
- Not a peach, a plum.
- I don't care if he picked a raisin...


632
01:05:51.766 --> 01:05:55.171
out of Sammy Davis' eye socket,
I prefer peaches.


633
01:05:56.312 --> 01:05:58.383
Then I'm not paying for it.

634
01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:07.559
So when did Lee get to you?

635
01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:11.437
I was the first
Chinese cop in the 15th.

636
01:06:11.744 --> 01:06:13.690
Thought I was gonna clean up Chinatown.

637
01:06:14.163 --> 01:06:16.693
But white cops wouldn't work with me.

638
01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:19.988
And the people wouldn't talk to a cop,
Chinese or not.


639
01:06:20.503 --> 01:06:22.571
Only Benny Wong would talk to me.

640
01:06:22.671 --> 01:06:25.118
He took me around,
took care of my debts...


641
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.868
fed me a few busts.

642
01:06:27.968 --> 01:06:30.248
Made me look good, and I liked it.

643
01:06:30.846 --> 01:06:32.957
Then he became my godfather.

644
01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:36.087
At that time, Henry Lee was nothing.

645
01:06:37.978 --> 01:06:41.467
One night, my father walks into
a gambling house and ends up dead.


646
01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:46.639
Turns out,
Lee knew there was a contract on him.


647
01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:49.265
He made it clear.

648
01:06:49.365 --> 01:06:50.599
He could have told me.

649
01:06:50.699 --> 01:06:52.643
I could have saved him.

650
01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:55.646
Got me thinking I was better
at my job with him...


651
01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.525
than without him.

652
01:06:57.915 --> 01:06:59.152
And he was right.

653
01:07:02.253 --> 01:07:03.781
Give me everything you got on this guy.

654
01:07:04.213 --> 01:07:07.700
Detective in the 15th Precinct.
His name is Daniel Wallace.


655
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.080
His old man went crooked
out of the two-five. Check on him too.


656
01:07:17.935 --> 01:07:19.839
Mr. Wong...

657
01:07:20.187 --> 01:07:21.922
we're running a one-day sale.

658
01:07:22.022 --> 01:07:23.549
Chance of a lifetime.

659
01:07:23.649 --> 01:07:26.346
The opportunity to buy your freedom.

660
01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.345
Now, this tape was obtained...

661
01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:31.976
by a federal agent working undercover
inside the Tong.


662
01:07:35.494 --> 01:07:38.230
I'll put a pistol
in your mouth and pull

663
01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:41.067
- Hello?
- Patience has paid off.


664
01:07:41.167 --> 01:07:44.403
Uncle Benny made a visit to the FBI.

665
01:07:44.503 --> 01:07:46.324
His time is over.

666
01:07:46.755 --> 01:07:48.076
Good.

667
01:07:51.177 --> 01:07:52.664
- We got a job.
- What is it?


668
01:07:55.556 --> 01:07:57.792
We take care of Benny Wong tonight.

669
01:07:58.594 --> 01:08:00.255
Come on, let's go.

670
01:08:07.943 --> 01:08:09.514
My friends are waiting for me.

671
01:08:12.907 --> 01:08:15.559
How long do you think
the feds are gonna be watching us?


672
01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:18.898
Month. Maybe two.

673
01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:25.113
I didn't want Lee involving you.

674
01:08:25.628 --> 01:08:26.948
It's not your fault.

675
01:08:27.421 --> 01:08:29.573
What I'm saying
is that you're alone now.


676
01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:31.953
You can't trust anybody
in the department.


677
01:08:32.635 --> 01:08:34.495
Not the guys in the 15th.

678
01:08:34.595 --> 01:08:36.291
Not the guys in the AGU.

679
01:08:37.389 --> 01:08:40.753
And you sure can't trust Henry Lee.

680
01:08:41.101 --> 01:08:43.548
So if anything gets sticky,
you come to me.


681
01:08:45.064 --> 01:08:46.884
How do I know I can trust you?

682
01:08:48.734 --> 01:08:49.927
You don't.

683
01:08:50.027 --> 01:08:54.892
Hey. Hey. I know this might sound crazy,
but I'm glad it's not just me.


684
01:08:58.202 --> 01:09:00.106
You hungry? I could buy you a plum.

685
01:09:02.915 --> 01:09:06.321
- I got plans.
- Maybe next time.


686
01:09:08.045 --> 01:09:10.656
Yeah. Next time.

687
01:09:10.756 --> 01:09:12.118
Thanks.

688
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:40.021
May?

689
01:09:59.805 --> 01:10:02.168
I gotta take a leak, man.

690
01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:20.643
He said he wanted
me at the other ward.

691
01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:29.612
She's lucky you found her.

692
01:10:33.505 --> 01:10:36.158
I want you to write her up
as a deceased.


693
01:10:36.258 --> 01:10:39.328
- Nick.
- She recovers, she go to work.


694
01:10:39.428 --> 01:10:43.207
Two weeks later,
she back in here, maybe not so lucky.


695
01:10:43.307 --> 01:10:44.541
You're asking a lot.

696
01:10:54.193 --> 01:10:56.178
Let her stay here a few days.

697
01:10:56.278 --> 01:10:58.391
Then I come to get her.

698
01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.686
What the fuck are you doing?

699
01:11:04.203 --> 01:11:05.980
I'm sick.

700
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.233
I wasn't sure
if I had to go back inside or not.


701
01:11:17.007 --> 01:11:19.370
I'm all right, man, let's go.

702
01:11:22.221 --> 01:11:24.709
What the fuck's going on here?
Let's get out of here.


703
01:11:26.453 --> 01:11:29.005
Hello, is this Domino's Pizza?

704
01:11:32.481 --> 01:11:34.091
Jack thought
he was gonna shit his pants.


705
01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:14.300
Uncle Benny.

706
01:12:16.066 --> 01:12:19.514
You kill me?
You're not man enough, huh?


707
01:12:25.117 --> 01:12:27.647
We kill you anyway!

708
01:12:28.704 --> 01:12:31.025
Uncle Benny!

709
01:12:40.382 --> 01:12:42.203
Wallace!

710
01:12:46.221 --> 01:12:47.875
Wallace!

711
01:12:49.224 --> 01:12:50.834
Where are you going?

712
01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:53.796
Lee's not covering my old man
with the Italians. I gotta move him.


713
01:12:53.896 --> 01:12:56.799
- I told him to stop.
- Why the hell did you do that?


714
01:12:56.899 --> 01:12:59.426
Because the feds are building a case
against you.


715
01:12:59.526 --> 01:13:01.595
- How do you know?
- Lee told me.


716
01:13:01.695 --> 01:13:05.599
If they nabbed you, it would take
three seconds for you to give them me.


717
01:13:05.699 --> 01:13:08.227
- I would never do that.
- I'm not saying it's fatal.


718
01:13:08.327 --> 01:13:11.980
The point now is to cover tracks and
keep everything clean on the surface.


719
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.486
When they call you in,
keep your mouth shut.


720
01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:24.870
This is your cut from Lee. Four grand.

721
01:13:27.221 --> 01:13:29.417
I gotta get to the hospital.

722
01:13:31.558 --> 01:13:34.338
- Where are you gonna move him?
- I don't know.


723
01:13:40.526 --> 01:13:43.347
- To cover your old man.
- I can't.


724
01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.058
Just take it.

725
01:13:49.243 --> 01:13:51.105
Thanks.

726
01:13:52.246 --> 01:13:55.065
Remember, don't say anything.

727
01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:58.195
Let me deal with the FBI, all right?

728
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.503
Whoa-ho.

729
01:14:16.603 --> 01:14:18.549
Hard to find you, Jack.

730
01:14:19.731 --> 01:14:21.175
Tell her to take in a movie.

731
01:14:22.484 --> 01:14:26.265
- Go on!
- I wanted to call. I couldn't.


732
01:14:26.697 --> 01:14:28.140
Now I'm here.

733
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.187
So, what do you want to tell me
about Benny Wong?


734
01:14:32.619 --> 01:14:35.856
Daniel Wallace? FBI.

735
01:14:35.956 --> 01:14:38.442
Hi, could you pass
that letter off to my father?


736
01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:39.985
He's in 409. Sean Wallace.

737
01:14:40.085 --> 01:14:42.779
- Back off. What the hell is going on?
- Don't be an ass.


738
01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:44.948
Don't touch my gun or badge.
I'm active.


739
01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:48.160
Fine. Let's just get out of here
real quietly, all right?


740
01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.998
Just got a few questions
we'd like to ask you.


741
01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:54.502
- Look, I got my father...
- We'll put someone on the door.


742
01:14:57.144 --> 01:14:59.838
Pass it. Thank you.

743
01:14:59.938 --> 01:15:02.799
- Then everybody took off?
- Yeah.


744
01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:04.512
Good.

745
01:15:05.402 --> 01:15:07.137
You're coming with me.

746
01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:08.472
Where?

747
01:15:08.572 --> 01:15:11.725
You're gonna tell the feds you've been
working with Wallace and me.


748
01:15:11.825 --> 01:15:13.852
That the hit on Benny was Fukienese...

749
01:15:13.952 --> 01:15:16.313
and you're eager to testify
against Bobby Vu.


750
01:15:16.413 --> 01:15:19.942
Do it right, I will back you
on trying to tip me before the hit.


751
01:15:20.042 --> 01:15:23.781
Do it wrong,
I go out of my way to bury you.


752
01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:54.770
So why the fuck didn't you tell me
you were Internal Affairs?


753
01:15:57.287 --> 01:15:59.481
Confidential undercover assignment,
Pete.


754
01:15:59.581 --> 01:16:02.734
Key word being "confidential,"
which nothing in the bureau is.


755
01:16:02.834 --> 01:16:05.779
- Fuck yourself.
- Nobody knows except a few of us in IA.


756
01:16:05.879 --> 01:16:09.575
Not even the commanding officer
in the 15th knows.


757
01:16:09.675 --> 01:16:12.163
Well, now I know.

758
01:16:12.803 --> 01:16:16.415
Bag man's kid. 
Internal Affairs. Wow.

759
01:16:16.515 --> 01:16:19.670
Your old man must think
you're a real scumbag?


760
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:25.634
Yeah.

761
01:16:25.899 --> 01:16:27.511
Well...

762
01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:29.430
So, what do you got on Chen?

763
01:16:30.487 --> 01:16:33.348
This isn't a federal case.
No reason to tell you anything.


764
01:16:33.448 --> 01:16:35.892
No, there is, actually.

765
01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:39.521
Because from where I'm sitting,
it looks to me like a young IA rat...


766
01:16:39.621 --> 01:16:41.773
went to build a case
against Nick Chen...


767
01:16:41.873 --> 01:16:44.026
- ...and ended up working for him.
- You're reaching.


768
01:16:44.126 --> 01:16:46.572
Enjoying for himself
the Chinatown whores...


769
01:16:46.878 --> 01:16:50.073
and financial assistance
to help a family gambling problem.


770
01:16:50.173 --> 01:16:51.408
Don't start with that.

771
01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:54.161
I'll start and finish with it
unless somebody hands me Chen.


772
01:16:54.261 --> 01:16:56.538
- He's here.
- Who's here?


773
01:16:56.638 --> 01:16:58.375
Chen.

774
01:17:01.935 --> 01:17:03.798
Hello, Pete.

775
01:17:04.771 --> 01:17:06.258
Nick.

776
01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:10.429
Who's your friend?

777
01:17:10.694 --> 01:17:12.888
A buddy of Wallace's and mine.

778
01:17:12.988 --> 01:17:16.268
He's an eyewitness
to the Benny Wong murder.


779
01:17:16.908 --> 01:17:18.646
Peanut?

780
01:17:20.996 --> 01:17:22.817
Eyewitness?

781
01:17:23.373 --> 01:17:25.861
And you bring him here to me. Why?

782
01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:33.160
You know why.

783
01:17:36.011 --> 01:17:38.499
My compliments, Wallace.

784
01:17:38.805 --> 01:17:41.961
You must've sunk your hooks
into Chen pretty good?


785
01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:44.503
- What did he want?
- To trade for you.


786
01:17:44.603 --> 01:17:46.088
He said that?

787
01:17:46.188 --> 01:17:48.843
Not in so many words.

788
01:17:48.982 --> 01:17:52.972
He brought that Fuke snitch of yours
who rode shotgun on the Wong killing.


789
01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.059
He gives me the eyewitness, I call off
the FBI investigation on Wallace.


790
01:17:57.908 --> 01:17:59.713
What'd you tell him?

791
01:18:02.412 --> 01:18:04.481
I told him fine.

792
01:18:04.581 --> 01:18:08.193
Putting the kid back on the street to get
the rest of the Fukes on tape...


793
01:18:08.293 --> 01:18:09.986
talking about the hit on Wong.

794
01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:14.535
And in return, I'm not gonna press
charges on young Wallace here.


795
01:18:16.176 --> 01:18:18.581
- Is Chen still here?
- No, he took off.


796
01:18:19.638 --> 01:18:21.998
But you gotta promise me
that I can be there...


797
01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:24.501
when you break the bad news to Chen...

798
01:18:24.601 --> 01:18:27.045
because that's gonna be
fucking priceless.


799
01:19:13.066 --> 01:19:15.095
Your wire's showing.

800
01:19:16.611 --> 01:19:18.557
How long you been IA?

801
01:19:20.615 --> 01:19:22.559
First assignment.

802
01:19:22.659 --> 01:19:27.316
Quickest way to a gold shield and
all you gotta do is bury your partner.


803
01:19:28.623 --> 01:19:32.738
The guy who shoved 10 grand
into your fist to back your play.


804
01:19:35.046 --> 01:19:38.077
I figure you ain't worth much
to the Chinks yet...


805
01:19:38.508 --> 01:19:43.707
so this must be Chen's money.

806
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.292
And you're gonna bury him.

807
01:19:47.392 --> 01:19:49.252
And for what?

808
01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.379
Turning his head?

809
01:19:51.479 --> 01:19:53.300
Making a few dollars?

810
01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:56.510
I know it wouldn't mean much to you,
Pop.


811
01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:58.681
Lying and cheating
is what you're made of.


812
01:19:59.029 --> 01:20:01.684
That's a hell of a lot better
than what you're made of.


813
01:20:03.783 --> 01:20:06.438
You don't even know
what I'm made of, Pop.


814
01:20:06.745 --> 01:20:09.064
It's the one thing
I should thank you for.


815
01:20:09.164 --> 01:20:10.899
Your lack of interest.

816
01:20:10.999 --> 01:20:12.734
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

817
01:20:12.834 --> 01:20:15.239
You've been real honest
with your partner.


818
01:20:15.921 --> 01:20:17.908
Ends justifies the means, Pop.

819
01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.995
The ends is bullshit.

820
01:20:21.635 --> 01:20:23.872
The means...

821
01:20:24.638 --> 01:20:26.750
is what you live with.

822
01:20:32.771 --> 01:20:34.383
Keep it.

823
01:20:34.814 --> 01:20:36.427
I don't want nothing from you.

824
01:21:39.504 --> 01:21:41.116
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

825
01:21:41.423 --> 01:21:42.657
Don't you like me?

826
01:21:42.757 --> 01:21:45.452
Of course I like you.
I just need to go to the bathroom.


827
01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:57.591
Shit.

828
01:22:03.903 --> 01:22:06.433
What the fuck are you doing?

829
01:22:23.631 --> 01:22:25.325
Where's the lieutenant?

830
01:22:25.425 --> 01:22:28.747
He left.
He said he wanted you to be very happy.


831
01:22:47.906 --> 01:22:52.310
The police are running in circles on
the unfortunate death of Uncle Benny.


832
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:56.106
Uncle Benny, yeah. We didn't kill him
for nothing, okay? Give us the money.


833
01:22:56.206 --> 01:23:00.568
Then it's time to bring the cargo ship
to port and unload our freight.


834
01:23:00.668 --> 01:23:03.321
One hundred eighty-six
at 40,000 apiece.


835
01:23:03.421 --> 01:23:05.490
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship...


836
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:07.578
- ...wouldn't you?
- Shit, yeah!


837
01:23:18.144 --> 01:23:19.840
Hot tea.

838
01:24:10.029 --> 01:24:13.808
The only time I was ever in here,
I was talking to my godfather.


839
01:24:13.908 --> 01:24:17.812
- Uncle Benny was a great man.
- You would know better than anyone.


840
01:24:17.912 --> 01:24:21.860
But even a great man
can outlast his time.


841
01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:24.235
I've got something for you.

842
01:24:24.335 --> 01:24:27.530
Should quiet any doubts
as to Wallace's character.


843
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:31.159
The Fukes are bringing in
a highly valuable cargo by ship.


844
01:24:31.259 --> 01:24:33.912
Bobby Vu will be on site
supervising the unloading.


845
01:24:34.012 --> 01:24:36.414
Take the Fukes and half the cargo.

846
01:24:36.514 --> 01:24:38.333
I'll keep the other half.

847
01:24:39.893 --> 01:24:42.256
You're getting greedy.

848
01:24:42.729 --> 01:24:44.925
I'm an American.

849
01:24:46.608 --> 01:24:48.345
Hey. Let's go.

850
01:24:48.776 --> 01:24:51.888
We gotta pick up Jack
and send him to the feds.


851
01:24:51.988 --> 01:24:53.306
What time is it?

852
01:24:53.406 --> 01:24:56.351
Time for a shower. You stink.

853
01:24:57.994 --> 01:25:00.816
- Got a match?
- Yeah.


854
01:25:08.046 --> 01:25:10.158
You know, you were right.

855
01:25:11.424 --> 01:25:13.993
- About what?
- I wish it was neither of us.


856
01:25:14.093 --> 01:25:18.208
But the fact is,
I'm glad it's not just me.


857
01:25:20.099 --> 01:25:21.253
Get up.

858
01:25:46.626 --> 01:25:48.530
You sure it was Henry Lee?

859
01:25:49.462 --> 01:25:51.158
It was him.

860
01:25:54.634 --> 01:25:58.580
I think everybody here knows Assistant
U.S. Attorney Margaret Wheeler.


861
01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.124
Gentlemen, tape's good.

862
01:26:01.224 --> 01:26:04.085
Probably enough for convictions
on Bobby Vu and the rest.


863
01:26:04.185 --> 01:26:05.336
I think we hold off.

864
01:26:05.436 --> 01:26:08.506
We wait till they make their move
to bring in the illegal shipment.


865
01:26:08.606 --> 01:26:11.676
We bust them on the ship,
then we go for the murder charge.


866
01:26:11.776 --> 01:26:15.013
With Jack connecting the dots
to an ongoing criminal enterprise...


867
01:26:15.113 --> 01:26:16.475
we get life sentences.

868
01:26:17.323 --> 01:26:19.434
- What about Henry Lee?
- What about him?


869
01:26:19.534 --> 01:26:20.852
Do we have a case, Pete?

870
01:26:20.952 --> 01:26:23.188
Enough to drag Mr. Lee
before a grand jury.


871
01:26:23.288 --> 01:26:25.607
It's his word against their word,
and he'll win.


872
01:26:25.707 --> 01:26:29.068
We wait till after the shipment comes in,
then the tape's got merit.


873
01:26:29.168 --> 01:26:31.073
Daniel, what are your thoughts?

874
01:26:32.964 --> 01:26:34.159
It's Margaret's call.

875
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.910
Then we wait.
Everybody works round the clock.


876
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:40.580
As soon as Jack finds out
when delivery is set, we'll reconvene...


877
01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.123
and make the arrests.

878
01:26:42.223 --> 01:26:44.211
That's it, gentlemen.

879
01:26:44.475 --> 01:26:46.419
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.


880
01:26:46.519 --> 01:26:51.007
Nick, what do you say
after we bust the Fuke Dragons...


881
01:26:51.107 --> 01:26:53.009
we get together, bury the hatchet?

882
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:55.053
- Oh, can't wait.
- All right.


883
01:26:55.153 --> 01:26:56.638
Danny, you up for that?

884
01:26:56.738 --> 01:26:57.931
Oh, yeah. Sure.

885
01:26:58.031 --> 01:26:59.393
Good.

886
01:27:05.955 --> 01:27:07.148
Bacardi and Coke.

887
01:27:07.248 --> 01:27:08.483
I'll get a Bud.

888
01:27:08.583 --> 01:27:10.026
I got it.

889
01:27:15.298 --> 01:27:18.534
The suckers lose themselves
In the games they love to play


890
01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:20.245
I gave the fed to Lee.

891
01:27:20.345 --> 01:27:22.121
The children love to sing

892
01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:23.331
I know.

893
01:27:23.431 --> 01:27:25.875
But then their voices slowly fade away

894
01:27:25.975 --> 01:27:27.585
People always take a step away

895
01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:30.382
I'm gonna have to answer for him
someday.


896
01:27:31.397 --> 01:27:33.885
We all have something to answer for.

897
01:27:35.735 --> 01:27:36.928
Yeah.

898
01:27:37.028 --> 01:27:40.390
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do


899
01:27:44.494 --> 01:27:45.645
Speak of the devil.

900
01:27:45.745 --> 01:27:47.563
- Lee.
- Yeah.


901
01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:49.482
Order me another.

902
01:27:49.582 --> 01:27:52.694
No apology because my urge is genuine

903
01:27:52.794 --> 01:27:53.947
It's Chen.

904
01:27:55.755 --> 01:27:57.951
I've been paging you all day.

905
01:27:58.257 --> 01:27:59.536
What do you want?

906
01:27:59.801 --> 01:28:02.414
Wallace is Internal Affairs.

907
01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.127
- What?
- You heard me.


908
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:08.710
I don't believe it.

909
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:11.170
Your girlfriends found a wire on him
last night.


910
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:14.759
I checked it out, and the fuck
is making a case against you.


911
01:28:15.066 --> 01:28:17.429
- You there?
- Yeah.


912
01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:19.804
Who knows how long he was wired.

913
01:28:19.904 --> 01:28:21.472
He's gotta go.

914
01:28:21.572 --> 01:28:23.349
You kill him tonight.

915
01:28:23.449 --> 01:28:27.312
The Fukes are taking delivery in one
hour, Pier 25 at Port Imperial in Jersey.


916
01:28:27.412 --> 01:28:28.980
A ship called the Dorian.

917
01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.692
Take him along, make sure he doesn't
leave the boat, you understand me?


918
01:28:32.792 --> 01:28:36.529
I don't give a shit about the cargo, the
Fukes. Just make sure Wallace is dead.


919
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:38.492
Are we clear?

920
01:28:39.882 --> 01:28:42.078
He'll hang us both.

921
01:28:43.261 --> 01:28:44.704
Yeah.

922
01:28:44.804 --> 01:28:46.750
I understand.

923
01:29:46.699 --> 01:29:48.267
You get ahold of him?

924
01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:49.894
Yeah.

925
01:29:49.994 --> 01:29:52.105
And did you tell him about the tape?

926
01:29:52.205 --> 01:29:53.775
No.

927
01:29:54.624 --> 01:29:56.943
Well, what did he say?

928
01:29:57.043 --> 01:29:58.905
He wanted to tell me that the Fukes...

929
01:29:59.212 --> 01:30:02.532
are picking up the shipment
in an hour in Jersey.


930
01:30:02.632 --> 01:30:05.701
Well, shit, we gotta move.
Did you call the feds?


931
01:30:05.801 --> 01:30:07.414
Yeah.

932
01:30:07.553 --> 01:30:09.457
They're gonna meet us there.

933
01:30:09.889 --> 01:30:11.668
Well, let's go.

934
01:30:36.207 --> 01:30:38.695
No sign of anybody.

935
01:30:41.045 --> 01:30:42.738
Have a look.

936
01:30:42.838 --> 01:30:45.410
- Lee said an hour, right?
- Yeah.


937
01:30:56.978 --> 01:31:00.008
- Still nothing?
- No.


938
01:31:01.399 --> 01:31:02.552
Are you sure?

939
01:31:03.818 --> 01:31:06.097
Yep. It's all clear.

940
01:31:08.406 --> 01:31:10.352
What about Internal Affairs?

941
01:31:12.034 --> 01:31:15.146
- What?
- I forgot to mention...


942
01:31:15.246 --> 01:31:18.902
Lee thinks they are making a case
against someone in the 15th.


943
01:31:20.126 --> 01:31:22.906
- Who?
- He didn't know.


944
01:31:23.337 --> 01:31:25.492
Maybe it's just a rumor.

945
01:31:26.757 --> 01:31:28.119
You hear anything?

946
01:31:31.178 --> 01:31:33.625
- They're here.
- You keep watching.


947
01:31:48.321 --> 01:31:50.558
We got to let them lead us
to the cargo.


948
01:31:53.451 --> 01:31:55.313
Come on!

949
01:31:55.828 --> 01:31:57.104
Go!

950
01:31:57.204 --> 01:31:59.192
They're heading away from us.

951
01:32:06.005 --> 01:32:09.953
What would you do if you knew
IA had a case against you?


952
01:32:11.886 --> 01:32:13.665
I don't know.

953
01:32:14.764 --> 01:32:19.087
What would you do if you knew
your partner gave you up, amigo?


954
01:32:28.152 --> 01:32:29.679
Answer me!

955
01:32:29.779 --> 01:32:30.932
I'm asking you!

956
01:32:33.115 --> 01:32:34.477
I don't know.

957
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:39.482
You should have let me die in the car
that day.


958
01:32:39.622 --> 01:32:41.985
At least then I die a cop.

959
01:32:43.834 --> 01:32:45.697
You are a cop.

960
01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.575
You're a good cop.

961
01:32:50.049 --> 01:32:52.159
I tell that to anybody that asks me.

962
01:32:52.259 --> 01:32:53.371
And you?

963
01:32:53.761 --> 01:32:55.331
I don't know.

964
01:32:56.013 --> 01:32:59.085
All I know is you saved me
and you saved my father.


965
01:33:00.142 --> 01:33:02.380
My life is really yours to do with
as you wish.


966
01:38:50.701 --> 01:38:54.273
Wallace. Come here.

967
01:39:07.051 --> 01:39:10.371
- Maybe that's all of them.
- Bobby Vu is here.


968
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:12.706
He would never leave without us.

969
01:39:12.806 --> 01:39:14.627
You mean without you.

970
01:39:27.071 --> 01:39:29.932
- Where?
- Come here.


971
01:39:35.037 --> 01:39:36.524
No!

972
01:39:38.457 --> 01:39:39.900
Fuck you!

973
01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:04.260
Shit. Hold on.

974
01:40:05.734 --> 01:40:08.598
You all right? You okay?

975
01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.144
I'm so sorry.

976
01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:23.652
Who sends a white cop undercover
in Chinatown?


977
01:40:23.752 --> 01:40:25.948
I swear to God, 
I wish they never did.

978
01:40:28.674 --> 01:40:31.913
Nick. Nick, can you hear me?

979
01:40:32.803 --> 01:40:34.207
Nick.

980
01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:40.254
Bring a fucking stretcher now!

981
01:40:42.271 --> 01:40:43.799
Nick.

982
01:40:44.731 --> 01:40:45.883
Nick.

983
01:40:45.983 --> 01:40:48.095
It's just you and me.

984
01:40:50.404 --> 01:40:51.599
I'm your partner.

985
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:53.601
Please.

986
01:40:55.617 --> 01:40:57.980
Where's the stretcher?!

987
01:40:59.163 --> 01:41:01.275
Nick, you gotta hold on.

988
01:41:29.943 --> 01:41:32.473
You wanna get Wallace out here, please?

989
01:41:36.366 --> 01:41:39.230
You wanna get Wallace out here, please?
Now.


990
01:41:54.009 --> 01:41:56.120
What is this bullshit?

991
01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:57.830
Exactly what it says.

992
01:41:57.930 --> 01:42:00.124
After a month-long investigation,
I find no evidence...


993
01:42:00.224 --> 01:42:01.750
supporting any charges against Chen.

994
01:42:03.435 --> 01:42:05.462
Think you can get away with this?

995
01:42:05.562 --> 01:42:09.091
Forget it, man. That man's responsible
for the death of a federal agent.


996
01:42:09.191 --> 01:42:10.845
The man's dead.

997
01:42:11.526 --> 01:42:15.264
And no matter what you believe,
the officer died a good fucking cop.


998
01:42:15.364 --> 01:42:16.642
Move.

999
01:42:35.467 --> 01:42:38.078
Henry Lee, you're under arrest.

1000
01:42:38.178 --> 01:42:40.455
I'd like to introduce you
to my attorney.


1001
01:42:40.555 --> 01:42:43.458
I'd like to introduce you to the inmates
at Rikers Island...


1002
01:42:43.558 --> 01:42:45.338
but that'll take a few weeks.

1003
01:42:46.561 --> 01:42:51.594
I was very saddened to hear
about your friend Lieutenant Chen.


1004
01:42:52.809 --> 01:42:57.229
I'm sorry. He wasn't your friend
after all, was he?


1005
01:42:59.366 --> 01:43:03.647
I'd like to thank you for killing
all the witnesses against me.


1006
01:43:04.413 --> 01:43:05.856
Not all.

1007
01:43:05.956 --> 01:43:07.983
Not the one who recorded this tape.

1008
01:43:08.083 --> 01:43:10.277
We didn't kill him for nothing.
Give us the money.


1009
01:43:10.377 --> 01:43:13.908
Then it's time to bring the ship
to port and unload our freight.


1010
01:43:14.756 --> 01:43:17.159
One hundred eighty-six
at 40,000 apiece.


1011
01:43:17.259 --> 01:43:19.828
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship, wouldn't you?


1012
01:43:20.758 --> 01:43:22.776
Shit, yeah!

1013
01:43:27.102 --> 01:43:29.922
Let's go, hotshot. 
You're under arrest.

1014
01:43:30.022 --> 01:43:32.591
You have the right to remain silent.
You understand?


1015
01:43:32.691 --> 01:43:35.427
You have the right to refuse
to answer any questions.


1016
01:43:35.527 --> 01:43:39.014
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.


1017
01:43:39.114 --> 01:43:42.436
You have the right
to have an attorney present...
