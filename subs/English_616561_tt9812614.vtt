00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:45.167
This is my story
as I remember it


2
00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:52.417
HOPE

3
00:02:05.707 --> 00:02:07.792
Thank you.

4
00:02:10.957 --> 00:02:13.332
- Bye.
- Goodbye.


5
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.457
Hi!

6
00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:41.750
- We're making a gingerbread castle!
- I can tell.


7
00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:44.792
- Look at this.
- Oops.


8
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.375
- Hello?
- Hello!


9
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.542
Hi.

10
00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.000
Hi, dear.

11
00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.457
- Hi.
- Good to see you.


12
00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.082
Wow! Look at this!

13
00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:19.707
Hi!
How's it gone here?


14
00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:23.125
- Henrik and Ada took care of us.
- What about me?


15
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.875
Haven't I taken care of you?
And made dinner?


16
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.917
- Hi.
- Yes, twice in four weeks.


17
00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:35.250
If you're that ungrateful, I don't mind.
I'm leaving.


18
00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:40.457
- I'm going out with some friends.
- Okay. Bye. See you.


19
00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:43.542
Where's Dad?

20
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.957
- He's working late.
- As usual.


21
00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:50.082
Bye!

22
00:03:50.207 --> 00:03:53.542
Will you help decorate the tree tomorrow?

23
00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:58.792
- When are we going to buy the tree?
- Tomorrow.


24
00:04:00.582 --> 00:04:03.667
How are you doing?

25
00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.582
Okay.

26
00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:08.332
- Okay?
- Yes.


27
00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:14.375
Her heart is broken.

28
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.082
- I heard her tell Dad.
- Were you spying again?


29
00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:22.375
How else am I supposed
to find out anything?


30
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.625
Hey...

31
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.166
What's going on here?

32
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.333
But hey...

33
00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:08.833
We agreed that you wouldn't work evenings.
I never do when you're away.


34
00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.416
Take it easy. Everything went fine.

35
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:14.875
I took care of it my way.

36
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.333
Using the older kids as babysitters?

37
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.000
Seen any reviews?

38
00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:30.000
Yes, there have been a couple.

39
00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:34.416
- And?
- They were pretty short. But favorable.


40
00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:39.416
Not like in theatre,
where they're neither?


41
00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:52.000
Could you turn off the light?

42
00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:55.833
- You want me to go to the study?
- Not really.


43
00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.083
I can't seem to
get rid of this headache.

44
00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:03.625
It's just as bad in the morning
as when I go to bed at night.


45
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.625
Right, lousy hotel beds.

46
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.833
And stress.

47
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:21.708
The day before Christmas Eve

48
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:25.958
I got these after an optical checkup.

49
00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:33.291
- Right, reading glasses?
- Yes.


50
00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:36.541
Custom-made prism lenses.

51
00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:41.500
- But I still can't read. I just get dizzy.
- I see.


52
00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:53.000
I want you to take an MRI scan.

53
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.791
- When?
- Now. Before they close for Christmas.


54
00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:31.750
I read a review of
your latest performance.


55
00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:35.041
You did? Where?

56
00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:39.958
In a newspaper in the living room.
A foreign newspaper.


57
00:07:40.083 --> 00:07:44.125
That was just a write-up, Dad.
Not a review.


58
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.666
Write-up or review,

59
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:51.208
it's still your first production abroad.

60
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:54.250
It's a huge deal. Really.

61
00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.000
Was Tomas there?

62
00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:02.208
- Was Tomas there?
- He stayed home to look after the kids.


63
00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:05.791
Yes, I understand. But...

64
00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:10.500
- It's good to be here.
- Just a moment, Dad. Hello?


65
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.666
I'm coming.

66
00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:32.750
It's me.
How quickly can you get to our physician?


67
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.083
Don't ask. Come as soon as you can.

68
00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:42.917
- Hi.
- Hi, Tomas.


69
00:08:48.207 --> 00:08:51.917
I'm afraid I have bad news.
Anja's diagnosis,


70
00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:57.707
her lung cancer operation a year ago,
evolved the way I feared.


71
00:08:57.832 --> 00:09:04.707
The MRI images reveal a major tumor
surrounded by a large amount of fluid.


72
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.125
An edema.

73
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.500
It's most likely a secondary tumor,
a metastatic growth.


74
00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:24.000
It's not unusual for lung cancer
to spread to the brain like that.


75
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.207
It's incurable.

76
00:09:40.457 --> 00:09:43.542
No words can express how sorry I am.

77
00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:51.707
Feels like I've known it for ages.

78
00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:57.332
You often have some premonition.

79
00:10:02.457 --> 00:10:07.500
Before you came, I spoke to the oncologist
on call at the Cancer Center at Ulleval.


80
00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:11.207
She's waiting for you
with more information.


81
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.417
Where did you park?

82
00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:33.582
I don't know.

83
00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:42.957
How long have you felt something
was wrong without saying anything?


84
00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:45.250
I don't know.

85
00:10:47.207 --> 00:10:49.917
A couple of months, maybe.

86
00:10:55.667 --> 00:11:01.625
Why didn't the doctors realize
something was wrong?


87
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.082
- Why didn't they say anything?
- You never came to the control checkups.


88
00:11:07.207 --> 00:11:10.250
You didn't want me to come.

89
00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:15.667
Said you could handle it yourself.

90
00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:47.082
- Was it the kids?
- I don't know. I can't read.


91
00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.542
You can't read?

92
00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:56.707
So you have a cohabitant, three children
and three stepchildren?


93
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.167
Could you say anything about my prognosis?

94
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.957
Don't you want to sit?

95
00:12:21.832 --> 00:12:24.542
It's too early for any prognosis.

96
00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:28.917
The specialists are on vacation
for the next four days.


97
00:12:29.042 --> 00:12:34.667
But the tumor might be in a favorable
location in terms of surgery.


98
00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:41.000
We don't know if it's a primary tumor,
or if it spread from your lungs.


99
00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:44.417
But how much time do I have
if it's spread?


100
00:12:44.542 --> 00:12:47.375
I can't give you an answer.

101
00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:54.707
Initially you'll receive medication.
The edema, the fluid around the tumor,


102
00:12:54.832 --> 00:13:00.667
is so large that you'll need high doses
of steroids to avoid brain death.


103
00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:06.667
The medication, Medrol, will relieve
the swelling and the pressure.


104
00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:12.750
But if your headache, nausea
or visual impairment increases,


105
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.542
you'll have to be admitted.

106
00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:19.125
I want to stay home.
I was in hospital last Christmas.


107
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.000
- Don't want my kids to hate the holidays.
- I understand.


108
00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:27.167
But if it gets too difficult,
you need to call us.


109
00:13:27.957 --> 00:13:32.167
I don't advise you
to read about the side effects.


110
00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:37.457
Just remember that some people experience
a kind of high with lots of energy.


111
00:13:37.582 --> 00:13:43.082
While others get irritable and impatient.
It varies from person to person.


112
00:13:43.207 --> 00:13:45.207
Excuse me.

113
00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:49.792
Julie.

114
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.332
Hi.

115
00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.792
We're just shopping.

116
00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:05.042
Could you make sure Grandpa
gets something to eat? Yes.


117
00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:10.500
And could you empty the laundry
and put in a new load?


118
00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:15.082
Yes. Okay. Thanks. See you.

119
00:14:17.332 --> 00:14:19.917
- What is it?
- Nothing.


120
00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:24.792
Excuse me? I recommend that you
take the first dose right away.


121
00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:29.707
And here's your medication.

122
00:14:41.457 --> 00:14:45.750
- What do we tell the kids?
- Nothing.


123
00:14:48.042 --> 00:14:52.957
Not until we have some answers,
know more about what to expect.


124
00:14:55.417 --> 00:14:57.875
What about your father?

125
00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:29.582
- Mom? Mom?
- Yes?


126
00:15:29.707 --> 00:15:32.582
- Did you find it?
- Yes.


127
00:15:34.957 --> 00:15:37.707
- Here.
- Thank you.


128
00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:41.332
Alright? Ready?

129
00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:43.667
Can you reach it?

130
00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:45.832
There!

131
00:15:45.957 --> 00:15:48.625
Oops!

132
00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:52.707
- Toddy.
- Great!


133
00:15:55.957 --> 00:15:58.417
- I'll have one.
- Nice!


134
00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:02.000
- No. Not for you, young lady.
- I'm sixteen.


135
00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:05.042
- Exactly. Here you go.
- Fine.


136
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.542
How old is that Belgian girl who's coming?

137
00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:18.542
She's a little older than you.
Maybe eleven. Isn't that exciting?


138
00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:23.500
I've invited a Belgian producer
and his daughter.


139
00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:25.957
Have you lost your mind?

140
00:16:26.082 --> 00:16:31.332
- We always have an open door at Christmas.
- You could have asked.


141
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.417
You were away.

142
00:16:47.042 --> 00:16:51.292
- Extra toddy for the kitchen assistant?
- Thank you.


143
00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:02.917
Don't you understand? I'm not ready
to meet new people right now.


144
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.042
Okay.

145
00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.291
When I'm gone...

146
00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:26.541
What?

147
00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:32.208
When I'm gone,
I want you to find someone new.


148
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:36.666
I mean it.

149
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.916
I don't think the kids
will make it with you alone.


150
00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:47.458
Just promise me you'll find someone.

151
00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:43.458
Christmas Eve

152
00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:13.625
- Haven't you slept at all?
- No. I'm too nauseous.


153
00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:21.041
My entire body's tingling.
It's awful.


154
00:19:23.625 --> 00:19:28.458
- Do you want to call the hospital?
- What? No.


155
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:37.208
I thought I'd buy those last presents
and get some groceries. You should rest.


156
00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:42.375
I want us to have a real Christmas.
I'm not tired.


157
00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.458
Has everyone tidied their rooms?

158
00:20:22.583 --> 00:20:25.000
Have you tidied up?

159
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.375
I hate it!
Can you please pull yourself together?


160
00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:55.208
- You never do any housework!
- Erlend and I have to do everything!


161
00:20:55.333 --> 00:21:00.166
- Can you stop that and help me instead?
- He never does his share!


162
00:21:00.291 --> 00:21:04.083
- Come on, you guys. It's Christmas Eve.
- Jesus!


163
00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:09.250
Isak doesn't do anything, Mom!
He's turning into a spoiled brat.


164
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:12.291
He isn't three anymore. He's nine.

165
00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:15.000
I'm ten.

166
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:19.916
Okay, I'll try to shape up.
Now could you please tidy your rooms?


167
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:27.000
God, I can't wait to move out.

168
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:30.625
Mom...

169
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.791
Mom!

170
00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:40.416
Promise me you'll never start smoking.
I won't let you. Promise me.


171
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:44.500
- Okay? Don't lie to me!
- I don't. You don't get it.


172
00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.791
Stop lying!

173
00:21:46.916 --> 00:21:50.375
I was a damn fool.
You don't have to be.


174
00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:09.250
You're a godsend, Isak.

175
00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:12.833
Did you know that?

176
00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:20.416
- How many wine glasses do you need?
- For everyone. Nine.


177
00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:28.916
- Aren't those Belgians coming after all?
- No.


178
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:32.333
- They aren't coming?
- Where are they going?


179
00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:36.041
- To Dag and Eline, I think.
- Who's that?


180
00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:40.041
- The theater manager.
- I see.


181
00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:46.416
- But they don't have kids.
- And they're dull as hell.


182
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:50.875
Yes, why couldn't they come to us?

183
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.666
Well, I don't know.

184
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:57.541
Maybe...

185
00:22:57.666 --> 00:23:01.208
Maybe it's too much for them.
Many new faces.


186
00:23:01.333 --> 00:23:05.291
Your dad doesn't know them
that well either.


187
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.125
Did you say they couldn't come?

188
00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:13.708
That's really mean.

189
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.583
Mom?

190
00:23:39.125 --> 00:23:41.333
Mom?

191
00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:22.958
Anja!

192
00:24:24.541 --> 00:24:27.041
Are you there?

193
00:24:33.583 --> 00:24:36.000
May I come in?

194
00:24:37.166 --> 00:24:39.250
Please?

195
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:52.458
I can't keep it a secret.

196
00:24:55.583 --> 00:25:01.708
You don't have to love me just because I'm
dying. But I need to know you'll help me.


197
00:25:16.958 --> 00:25:20.375
We're useless at sticking together.

198
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.875
We always have been.

199
00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:32.583
We couldn't even stick together
when times were good.


200
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:44.833
I don't want the kids to remember us
like this when I'm gone.


201
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:49.875
Like I remember my parents,
and you remember yours.


202
00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:54.958
I want to give them
something else to believe in.


203
00:26:09.083 --> 00:26:13.541
I can't do it on my own.
You have to help me.


204
00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:24.000
- Get out!
- We just need a breather.


205
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:27.958
- Get out of the couch, I said!
- Do we have to?


206
00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:30.791
Yes, Julie. For once in your life.

207
00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:37.583
My god, we've never been to church
on Christmas Eve before. What about Simon?


208
00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:41.666
- He's an atheist. You can't force him.
- Atheist or not.


209
00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:45.000
Get out if you want dinner later.

210
00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:47.958
- Grandpa's waiting.
- Okay.


211
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.916
Am I speaking with the oncologist on duty?
Yes, I'm a patient.


212
00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:02.625
Anja Richter.

213
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:12.250
I'm afraid.
My head feels like it's about to explode.


214
00:27:14.125 --> 00:27:17.291
No, I've never had anxiety like this.

215
00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:23.625
I'm nauseous absolutely all the time.

216
00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:27.583
I've got relentless stomach cramps.

217
00:27:28.666 --> 00:27:31.916
And I can't sleep at all.

218
00:27:34.208 --> 00:27:36.791
No, I don't want to go to hospital.

219
00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:40.708
But I don't know how long
I can go on pretending.


220
00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:47.416
Is there anyone there in the meantime
who can help me break it to the children?


221
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:49.791
Yes?

222
00:28:09.083 --> 00:28:11.708
- How do you feel?
- Blind.


223
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:27.541
- You look nice.
- Thanks.


224
00:28:49.208 --> 00:28:52.625
No, no, no. Put it away.

225
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:57.000
Wait. Take the starters.
It'll be ready in a moment.


226
00:28:57.125 --> 00:29:01.500
I just need a tiny piece of ham.
It's just decor, right?


227
00:29:01.625 --> 00:29:05.291
- Dad?
- Grandpa?


228
00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:09.750
- So tell me, how was church?
- The sermon was ridiculous.


229
00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:13.125
So farfetched it was almost funny.

230
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:19.000
- I just recruited an atheist! Any others?
- Poor preacher. She was so nervous.


231
00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:22.916
No wonder, with that bowl haircut.

232
00:29:24.916 --> 00:29:29.875
- I don't think it'll become a tradition.
- Probably not.


233
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.083
Here's to Christmas... and Grandpa!

234
00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:36.333
Cheers!

235
00:29:36.458 --> 00:29:39.000
Merry Christmas!

236
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.791
And here's to Anja.

237
00:29:46.041 --> 00:29:49.000
Back in great shape. Cheers.

238
00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:53.250
- Cheers!
- Cheers, Mom!


239
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.875
- We want everyone in the picture.
- Make room for Grandpa.


240
00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:13.833
- Come here.
- Mom will sit there. Just move over there.


241
00:30:14.833 --> 00:30:17.708
- Sit down as well, Tomas.
- No.


242
00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:21.750
You sit in the middle.
I'll take care of it.


243
00:30:21.875 --> 00:30:24.416
Sit in the middle.

244
00:30:26.666 --> 00:30:29.541
Looks great. Let me see...

245
00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:34.416
- A, F, E...
- May I?


246
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:38.750
- You sure are bossy, Martin.
- True enough.


247
00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:42.000
Sit next to Anja, okay?

248
00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:48.125
Everyone ready?

249
00:30:49.416 --> 00:30:52.500
Five, four, two, three!

250
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:55.916
One!

251
00:30:56.041 --> 00:30:58.125
Smile.

252
00:31:06.375 --> 00:31:10.166
Well, there's one last present. No card.

253
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:12.458
It's for Mom.

254
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.958
- Can I open it?
- Sure.


255
00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:34.875
"India"?

256
00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:42.750
It says you're getting

257
00:31:42.875 --> 00:31:45.708
a trip to India.

258
00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:48.125
- From Dad.
- Wow.


259
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:52.916
- Haven't you always wanted to go there?
- Yes.


260
00:31:53.041 --> 00:31:57.208
- Can I come with you? As your Sherpa?
- Nice move, Erlend.


261
00:31:57.333 --> 00:31:59.833
So it'll be you and Mom?

262
00:31:59.958 --> 00:32:03.166
Are you going together, or...?

263
00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:06.166
Well, that's up to her.

264
00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:09.000
What's a Sherpa?

265
00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:11.750
It's like a tour guide.

266
00:32:14.583 --> 00:32:17.000
Are you coming?

267
00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:25.208
Dad? My turn.

268
00:32:25.333 --> 00:32:27.541
No, no, no!

269
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.541
You're nuts! No!

270
00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:40.125
- Come on, Mom!
- Mom, come!


271
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.083
- No, Mom!
- No!


272
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:48.416
I'll throw up!

273
00:32:48.541 --> 00:32:52.291
- Hey, come on, Grandpa!
- Nope.


274
00:33:08.791 --> 00:33:10.791
Here.

275
00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:14.083
Do you have everything you need?

276
00:33:14.208 --> 00:33:20.000
- Was your evening as good as mine?
- It was a lovely Christmas Eve.


277
00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:23.416
- But...
- Goodnight, Dad.


278
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:26.666
Are the two of you struggling?

279
00:33:26.791 --> 00:33:31.500
I do wish that you and Tomas

280
00:33:31.625 --> 00:33:34.333
were happier together.

281
00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:43.708
We do what we like.
What we do best. We work.


282
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:46.375
At least I try to work.

283
00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:50.750
I guess we're as happy as we deserve.

284
00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:53.166
Well, Anja...

285
00:33:54.333 --> 00:33:59.375
You choose the life you get
to a great degree.


286
00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:08.250
I'll never be able to go to India.

287
00:34:10.583 --> 00:34:13.333
You don't know that yet.

288
00:34:13.458 --> 00:34:16.583
I can't even read about India.

289
00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:20.500
I can read for you.

290
00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:26.125
I had this great-aunt.

291
00:34:28.125 --> 00:34:30.500
She used to tell her husband:

292
00:34:30.625 --> 00:34:35.000
"When one of us dies,
I'm going to travel the world!"


293
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:51.125
Have you never imagined
I could die before you?


294
00:34:56.708 --> 00:34:58.833
Of course I have.

295
00:35:03.625 --> 00:35:07.000
Christmas Day

296
00:35:30.875 --> 00:35:35.000
Yes, I'm excited.
It'll be fun.


297
00:35:36.708 --> 00:35:41.291
No, me first. It's my turn!

298
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:46.541
Isak! Come in! 
Ready to party?

299
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:50.416
Hi, Erlend. Hi, Leif Martin.

300
00:35:50.541 --> 00:35:54.833
We followed the sound of Christmas carols.

301
00:35:55.958 --> 00:35:58.166
Thanks. Hi.

302
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.916
- Survived Christmas?
- Yes. Did you?


303
00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:04.250
I'm okay, but Arthur and Christmas...

304
00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:07.083
I love Christmas.

305
00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:11.666
You can hang it there.
Congratulations on the great reviews!


306
00:36:18.666 --> 00:36:22.416
We won't stay if
it's too much for you.

307
00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:26.750
If it gets tough,
we'll stick together.


308
00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:31.000
- Okay. Go on in. I need to take my Medrol.
- Are you sure?


309
00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:34.208
Yes, I won't be long.

310
00:36:57.333 --> 00:36:59.708
They're dying of thirst.

311
00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:04.833
Did you see the doctor?

312
00:37:04.958 --> 00:37:09.375
- Should I be worried? Everything okay?
- Yes.


313
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.333
That's great. You see? Hey...

314
00:37:13.458 --> 00:37:16.208
Your father is so proud of you.

315
00:37:16.333 --> 00:37:20.541
Really. But you haven't told him
anything about the show.


316
00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:26.166
Not Tomas either. I told him everything.
About the festival invitations.


317
00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:32.458
The grant for the new project.
They're so proud of you, both of them.


318
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:35.666
Why haven't you told them? Huh?

319
00:37:39.916 --> 00:37:42.416
Thanks.

320
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:45.541
- Come on. Vera's waiting.
- I'm coming.


321
00:38:02.875 --> 00:38:06.083
- Anja!
- Hi.


322
00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:10.875
Oh gosh. What is it about me
that turns Pollock on?


323
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.041
You're in heat.

324
00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:18.000
You're embarrassing me.
Stop it!


325
00:38:18.125 --> 00:38:21.083
- How was Amsterdam?
- Great.


326
00:38:21.208 --> 00:38:23.375
Let's go outside. Come.

327
00:38:32.666 --> 00:38:34.666
Oh my god!

328
00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:38.791
If only that mutt Pollock
had been human,


329
00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:41.125
there'd be hope for me too.

330
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.041
I can't find anyone who's single.

331
00:38:45.166 --> 00:38:49.166
They're either married, gay or minors.

332
00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:54.916
Enough about me.
Tell me about Amsterdam.


333
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.333
It's spread.

334
00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:07.333
To the brain. It's incurable.

335
00:39:10.958 --> 00:39:15.541
My doctor says I should pray
for a miracle. No one survives.


336
00:39:18.208 --> 00:39:21.125
We'll know more in a couple of days.

337
00:39:25.166 --> 00:39:27.791
- Can't they do anything?
- No.


338
00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:34.500
You sure?

339
00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:36.458
Pretty much.

340
00:39:36.583 --> 00:39:42.500
They just don't dare say so until all
the specialists have examined the images.


341
00:39:57.166 --> 00:39:59.125
Jesus Christ.

342
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.833
It's so unfair.

343
00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:06.333
If it had only... been me.

344
00:40:07.708 --> 00:40:10.083
Or Arthur or Tomas.

345
00:40:11.666 --> 00:40:14.250
I don't have kids.

346
00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:20.500
You've been alone with everything.
Tomas, he...


347
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.958
- The kids need you more than him.
- Don't say that.


348
00:40:26.083 --> 00:40:30.083
- Just when it's your turn to...
- Stop it, Vera.


349
00:40:46.666 --> 00:40:49.083
What can I do?

350
00:40:50.458 --> 00:40:53.500
For you? For all of you?

351
00:40:59.208 --> 00:41:01.583
I don't know.

352
00:41:01.708 --> 00:41:05.166
I don't even know
how to tell the kids.

353
00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:10.833
Only you and Tomas know.

354
00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:15.291
What does he say?
How's he taking it?


355
00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:18.500
I don't know.

356
00:41:23.916 --> 00:41:26.625
I haven't asked.

357
00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:41.833
I thought it was
supposed to be a secret?

358
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:45.875
Does Arthur know as well?

359
00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:49.416
No.

360
00:41:49.541 --> 00:41:53.083
It isn't always easy to help you, Anja.

361
00:44:18.708 --> 00:44:20.750
Anja...

362
00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:23.833
Anja.

363
00:44:23.958 --> 00:44:27.666
Anja! Anja!

364
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:29.833
Anja!

365
00:44:57.458 --> 00:44:59.541
There.

366
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:11.250
Second day of Christmas

367
00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:16.166
- Thanks for now.
- Let me take your suitcase.


368
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:18.541
I can cope.

369
00:45:19.625 --> 00:45:23.708
I'm no use if I can't even
carry my own suitcase.


370
00:45:23.833 --> 00:45:25.916
No.

371
00:45:38.875 --> 00:45:44.583
- Thanks. I'm going to the airport express.
- I'll get the door for you.


372
00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:47.416
- Have a nice trip!
- Thank you.


373
00:46:15.916 --> 00:46:18.458
What are you doing?

374
00:46:20.208 --> 00:46:25.583
- Are the boys asleep?
- Yes, in front of a bad Christmas movie.


375
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:32.833
You can go to bed.

376
00:46:32.958 --> 00:46:36.000
I'll stay up until Julie comes home.

377
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.916
No, I can't sleep anyway. 
I can stay up.

378
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.875
Oh, I hate Medrol!

379
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.083
I feel so high.
Like I'll never come back down.


380
00:46:57.791 --> 00:47:00.958
- It's so weird.
- What is?


381
00:47:01.083 --> 00:47:04.833
Before, if I tried to describe my life...

382
00:47:06.333 --> 00:47:10.541
My memories were never
in the right order, like...


383
00:47:10.666 --> 00:47:16.625
They were always tied to places I'd lived,
boyfriends I'd had, dance projects,


384
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.000
journeys, childbirths, deaths.

385
00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:26.916
But I never remembered
what the years were.


386
00:47:27.041 --> 00:47:31.000
But now, when I see the end...

387
00:47:31.125 --> 00:47:34.541
My life's laid out in chronological order.

388
00:47:36.458 --> 00:47:38.750
Almost like...

389
00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:44.583
A PowerPoint presentation
with a graphic timeline.


390
00:47:44.708 --> 00:47:48.041
Where the middle of my life is like...

391
00:47:48.166 --> 00:47:53.750
It looks like this thick gray graph

392
00:47:53.875 --> 00:47:56.458
of postpartum apathy.

393
00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:06.875
So how do I feature in the graphics?

394
00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:12.416
- Like a dot?
- No.


395
00:48:14.333 --> 00:48:17.041
Like many dots.

396
00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:20.000
Coming and going on the timeline.

397
00:48:24.583 --> 00:48:27.375
Right. Uplifting.

398
00:48:31.916 --> 00:48:35.416
Julie? Hi.

399
00:48:35.541 --> 00:48:37.458
Hi.

400
00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:40.875
Are you okay?

401
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Sure.

402
00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:45.875
What are you doing here?

403
00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:54.166
Hi. Why are you home so early?
Wasn't it any fun?


404
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:57.833
Oh, sure.
It was fun.


405
00:49:00.583 --> 00:49:03.333
I really have to pee.

406
00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:18.875
- It's not the first time.
- Oh, hush.


407
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.458
She's adventurous.

408
00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:25.375
Lusts for life. Like you.

409
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:31.166
She's got you under her thumb.

410
00:49:31.291 --> 00:49:33.291
Yes.

411
00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:37.583
Promise me you'll take good care of her.

412
00:49:40.958 --> 00:49:42.916
I will.

413
00:49:43.041 --> 00:49:45.208
December 27

414
00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:48.375
I'll be there as soon
as I can. Okay, bye.

415
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.166
- Yes?
- The images from Aleris.


416
00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:55.958
Thank you. The team
will review them tomorrow morning.


417
00:49:56.083 --> 00:50:02.458
We need some advice about what to tell
the children. We need to prepare them.


418
00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:06.916
Yes, it says so in your medical record.
It's not a good time.


419
00:50:07.041 --> 00:50:10.791
The specialist nurse
won't be back until January.


420
00:50:10.916 --> 00:50:13.833
Titles aren't that important.

421
00:50:15.958 --> 00:50:20.875
Yes? I'm on my way. I see.
Like I said, I'm sorry.


422
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.708
- Is there no one here with experience?
- Not during the holidays.


423
00:50:25.833 --> 00:50:30.458
Don't people die during the holidays?
Do you ask them to wait?


424
00:50:30.583 --> 00:50:35.375
I'm sure you see the challenge,
with so many children involved.


425
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.416
Not getting any certainty, no help.
Someone must be qualified.


426
00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:44.375
- Not like that. We're specialized.
- But you are human?


427
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.375
Don't you have any experience
with next of kin?


428
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.000
I realize this is difficult.
We've made out a prescription


429
00:50:53.125 --> 00:50:56.291
for sleeping pills and a sedative.

430
00:50:56.416 --> 00:51:00.125
It'll help you relax. Okay? I'm sorry.

431
00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:13.958
Hi. Welcome to Hospice Lovisenberg.
My name is Bente, I'm a nurse.


432
00:51:14.083 --> 00:51:18.208
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome. Let's go in there.


433
00:51:25.125 --> 00:51:29.750
Well, my advice is to not shield
the children from the truth.


434
00:51:29.875 --> 00:51:35.333
But try to convey it to them according to
their age and maturity.


435
00:51:35.458 --> 00:51:40.916
Your children won't be as vulnerable
as the children you have together.


436
00:51:41.041 --> 00:51:44.208
Because they'll still have a mother.

437
00:51:44.333 --> 00:51:48.916
Anja has taken responsibility for
my three oldest children too.


438
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:52.416
She's a key part of their lives, it's...

439
00:51:52.541 --> 00:51:57.791
Tomas. That's not how it works.
The youngest kids will lose their mother.


440
00:51:57.916 --> 00:52:02.750
They're all I think about
and care about protecting right now.


441
00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:08.541
You always expected me to feel and act
the same way to your kids as to our kids.


442
00:52:08.666 --> 00:52:13.250
Not just treat them equally,
but feel equally about all of them.


443
00:52:13.375 --> 00:52:19.250
I always thought it was the natural thing,
that I was unnatural and heartless.


444
00:52:19.375 --> 00:52:23.833
It's never been clearer to me
how misguided I was.


445
00:52:23.958 --> 00:52:26.791
I've always loved my own more.

446
00:53:06.208 --> 00:53:10.500
It's like we're at work together.
In a whole new field.


447
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:18.708
- This doesn't look like a hospital.
- That's what you said last Christmas.


448
00:53:18.833 --> 00:53:24.791
I often say you should give children

449
00:53:25.833 --> 00:53:31.625
Not matter what age, you should never
take their hope away.


450
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:36.500
- But I haven't been given any hope.
- We don't know that for sure.


451
00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:39.833
They say it's probably a metastatic tumor.

452
00:53:39.958 --> 00:53:43.875
It's incurable,
but they hope it's operable.


453
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.083
Okay. Good.

454
00:53:46.208 --> 00:53:51.666
And they have highly competent
neurosurgeons at Ulleval.


455
00:53:51.791 --> 00:53:56.791
And all statistics
should be read with caution.


456
00:53:56.916 --> 00:53:58.625
Meaning?

457
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.291
A patient with lung cancer
and brain metastasis


458
00:54:02.416 --> 00:54:07.083
has little chance of survival
in statistical terms.


459
00:54:07.208 --> 00:54:11.458
But in my three decades in the field,
I've seen patients


460
00:54:11.583 --> 00:54:15.208
who have survived brain metastases.

461
00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:20.375
They're just too few to show up
in the cancer statistics.


462
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.083
How many?

463
00:54:23.916 --> 00:54:26.958
I can count them on one hand.

464
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.083
Can I really just call him at home?

465
00:54:44.083 --> 00:54:47.708
Wouldn't I be jumping in line?

466
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:53.083
This isn't a good time
to be politically correct.


467
00:55:01.125 --> 00:55:04.458
- Do you want me to call him?
- No.


468
00:55:04.583 --> 00:55:07.416
That wouldn't be right.

469
00:55:07.541 --> 00:55:10.208
I've made a few calls, asked around.

470
00:55:10.333 --> 00:55:15.875
He's said to be the best neurosurgeon,
not just at Ulleval, but in Norway.


471
00:55:21.791 --> 00:55:25.500
- Okay, I'll do it. But I want to be alone.
- Okay.


472
00:55:25.625 --> 00:55:28.125
I'll wait outside.

473
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:30.833
Can I borrow your eyes first?

474
00:55:41.125 --> 00:55:43.083
Good luck.

475
00:55:55.958 --> 00:55:58.666
Hi.

476
00:55:58.791 --> 00:56:03.625
You don't know who I am.
My name is Anja Richter.


477
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.416
Am I interrupting anything?

478
00:56:07.541 --> 00:56:10.000
Right. Okay.

479
00:56:10.125 --> 00:56:13.666
I'm a patient at Ulleval
in a difficult situation.


480
00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:46.916
He was at a Christmas party, but
will perform the surgery if it's possible.


481
00:57:05.458 --> 00:57:08.583
I mean it. That's enough.

482
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.000
There. Stay down.

483
00:57:16.125 --> 00:57:18.333
They're waiting for us.

484
00:57:19.583 --> 00:57:23.500
Dad, Mom's tired of us
always being late, and...


485
00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:27.375
Everyone has to be here.
Just tell her


486
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.666
that it's a family crisis.

487
00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:38.333
- You're breaking up?
- No.


488
00:57:39.375 --> 00:57:42.500
No, Ada. We're not breaking up.

489
00:58:00.333 --> 00:58:03.375
- Who should start?
- I'll do it.


490
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.583
Okay.

491
00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:09.000
Good.

492
00:58:18.166 --> 00:58:20.583
Gather around the couch.

493
00:58:31.416 --> 00:58:34.000
Right, Anja...

494
00:58:35.416 --> 00:58:39.958
- Are we having a family council?
- Sort of.


495
00:58:44.375 --> 00:58:50.208
I've been informed that I have
a tumor in my brain.


496
00:58:53.208 --> 00:58:57.750
It's most likely spread from my lungs.

497
00:59:00.708 --> 00:59:06.916
The good news is that the tumor is seated
where they think it might be operable.


498
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:14.291
Well, they say it's serious, but...

499
00:59:14.416 --> 00:59:17.916
We still don't know what
the outcome will be.


500
00:59:18.041 --> 00:59:22.041
We'll find out more
at the hospital tomorrow.


501
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:31.000
They're going to operate on your head?

502
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:40.625
Inside your brain?

503
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:43.583
Yes, maybe.

504
00:59:43.708 --> 00:59:50.291
The good news is that if they do operate,
I'll have the best surgeon in the country.


505
00:59:52.916 --> 00:59:55.291
But...

506
00:59:55.416 --> 00:59:59.833
Last Christmas you told us
that everything would be okay.


507
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:05.250
Everyone thought so.
The doctors as well.


508
01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:09.000
But despite that, this happened.

509
01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:15.666
We spoke to a doctor today
who knew of several similar cases


510
01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:18.583
that had gone well.

511
01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:22.458
- Were there many?
- Quite a few.


512
01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:32.583
The milk.

513
01:01:04.458 --> 01:01:07.333
- Bye.
- Goodbye.


514
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.750
Bye.

515
01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:52.833
I'm sorry.

516
01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:57.416
Sorry for what?

517
01:01:59.041 --> 01:02:01.541
Sorry for being so mean.

518
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.625
You have nothing to apologize for.

519
01:02:08.916 --> 01:02:11.750
- I do.
- No.


520
01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:18.708
Sure?

521
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.375
Absolutely sure.

522
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.958
- I'll never forgive myself.
- For what?


523
01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:42.916
- For being a smoker.
- Don't say that.


524
01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:49.166
No one knows
that that's the reason.


525
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:53.500
- But I know.
- Stop torturing yourself.


526
01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:01.791
What are you taking?

527
01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:06.708
Vival and Imovane...

528
01:03:12.958 --> 01:03:16.333
December 28

529
01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:21.333
I brought some extra clothes just in case.

530
01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:26.125
And some proper coffee.
I don't really like that instant stuff.


531
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:30.333
- Where are the kids?
- They're still sleeping.


532
01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:55.208
- Nothing eases the nausea except food.
- It's the medication, steroids.


533
01:03:55.333 --> 01:04:00.083
- The same stuff they give to anorectics.
- How do you know?


534
01:04:00.208 --> 01:04:03.416
My new online friend, PubMed.com.

535
01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:06.125
Good morning.

536
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.208
Hi.

537
01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:11.541
Good morning.

538
01:04:14.833 --> 01:04:17.208
Good morning.

539
01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:22.083
We're going to the hospital.
Vera will stay here with you.


540
01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:25.833
Hi. Good morning.

541
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.000
Knut Asdam?

542
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.458
Hi. I'm Dr. Thea Falkentorp.
Please come with me.


543
01:04:58.333 --> 01:05:03.625
I realize that you're anxious,
so I'll get straight to the point.


544
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:10.333
The specialists have held a meeting
and studied your MRI images.


545
01:05:10.458 --> 01:05:17.291
We've given your brain surgery top
priority and scheduled it on 2 January.


546
01:05:17.416 --> 01:05:20.250
In five days.

547
01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:24.791
I understand you've contacted
a surgeon here at the hospital,


548
01:05:24.916 --> 01:05:28.625
and that he's agreed
to perform the surgery.


549
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.041
The images also show that the tumor

550
01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:40.833
is a metastasis from the lungs.

551
01:05:41.916 --> 01:05:44.666
That makes it incurable.

552
01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:00.166
So how much time do I have left?

553
01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:07.208
It's very hard to determine.
Cancer is like peeling an onion.


554
01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:09.416
- An onion?
- Yes.


555
01:06:09.541 --> 01:06:15.375
The picture is complicated.
It depends on the outcome of the surgery.


556
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.916
The result of the CAT scan
of your lungs today


557
01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:24.291
will reveal whether it's spread
to other organs in the body.


558
01:06:24.416 --> 01:06:28.541
They'll determine your treatment
moving forward.


559
01:06:31.416 --> 01:06:35.916
Could you be more specific?
This isn't just about me.


560
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:40.500
I need to...

561
01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:46.500
I need to know the worst possible outcome
to find out how to prepare the children.


562
01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:49.791
Anja...

563
01:06:49.916 --> 01:06:53.375
All cancer patients are different.

564
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:59.375
There are some who refuse to face reality.
It's too exhausting.


565
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.125
Fine, but I want to know.
How much time do I have left?


566
01:07:07.041 --> 01:07:10.833
In the worst case,
I'd say three months.


567
01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:15.666
But we hope the operation
will give you more than that.


568
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Is the operation itself dangerous?

569
01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:33.000
All operations involve a certain risk,
brain surgery in particular.


570
01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:37.916
The surgeon is more qualified
to answer that question.


571
01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:45.958
Can you get married before the surgery?

572
01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:50.833
Married? Well, yes.

573
01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:56.791
We do have a hospital chaplain
who can perform weddings.


574
01:07:56.916 --> 01:08:02.166
Normally, with all the paperwork,
I'm not sure it would be possible.


575
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:05.208
But there's room for exceptions.

576
01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:12.375
Was that a proposal?

577
01:08:16.833 --> 01:08:20.333
I don't understand why
you want to do it now.


578
01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:23.166
I thought you wanted to.

579
01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:26.417
Years ago, sure.
But why now?


580
01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:35.417
It just feels...

581
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.917
Like signing a death warrant.

582
01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:48.375
Otherwise we could have waited
until after the operation.


583
01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:55.292
It just feels right.
It's the only thing that feels right.


584
01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:02.625
If we're going to get married...

585
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.957
We both have to love each other.

586
01:09:21.875 --> 01:09:24.625
The dentist.

587
01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:29.042
Hello?

588
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.750
Right.

589
01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:36.792
No, I don't need an appointment.
My teeth don't matter.


590
01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:39.457
I have terminal cancer.

591
01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:43.167
You can just delete me from your list.

592
01:09:49.457 --> 01:09:51.457
Breathe in.

593
01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:54.207
Hold your breath.

594
01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:57.792
Breathe normally.

595
01:09:58.707 --> 01:10:03.707
- Can you breathe?
- It's like a burning claw around my chest.


596
01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:07.417
Try to breathe calmly and deeply.

597
01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:10.957
Breathe with your belly.

598
01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.875
Are you more relaxed now?
Breathe with your belly.


599
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.957
It'll be fine. You can do it.
You'll get the answers you need.


600
01:10:21.082 --> 01:10:25.125
We'll roll you in and start.

601
01:10:35.082 --> 01:10:37.500
I don't know.

602
01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:44.042
I don't know what's the medication, what's
her fear of dying, and what's just Anja.


603
01:10:44.167 --> 01:10:48.750
She's so volatile and intense.

604
01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:54.707
As if she didn't have enough energy
to begin with. I don't know.


605
01:10:56.207 --> 01:11:00.042
Yes, she's here now. I have to go.

606
01:11:00.167 --> 01:11:02.707
I will. Bye.

607
01:11:04.792 --> 01:11:06.917
How did it go?

608
01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:12.332
Not too good?

609
01:11:12.457 --> 01:11:14.375
Who was that?

610
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.917
I'm calling friends and family.
Like we agreed.


611
01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:21.125
That was Frans.

612
01:11:22.957 --> 01:11:25.792
What about Dad?

613
01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:30.167
He's the only one
I think you have to call yourself.


614
01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:32.375
I can't do it.

615
01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:36.457
Okay.

616
01:11:36.582 --> 01:11:39.375
What are people saying?

617
01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:43.957
Well, that they don't know what to say.

618
01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:47.375
They feel sorry for you and the kids.

619
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.375
Frans told me to
say he's thinking of you.

620
01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:57.292
- Was that all he had to say?
- No.


621
01:11:57.417 --> 01:12:03.625
He said he's sorry for me too,
having to take care of all the kids alone.


622
01:12:46.542 --> 01:12:48.667
It wasn't a problem.

623
01:12:48.792 --> 01:12:52.832
I managed to postpone
the production indefinitely.


624
01:12:54.957 --> 01:12:57.250
Hey...

625
01:12:57.375 --> 01:13:01.292
I need to know.
Have you been faithful?


626
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:09.250
I'd like to know if there
have been others while we have...


627
01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:13.750
It wouldn't be a big deal,
so don't be afraid to tell me.


628
01:13:16.417 --> 01:13:20.417
Think of it as my last wish.
A truthful exchange.


629
01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:24.292
- Is this a good idea?
- Does it have to be?


630
01:13:33.292 --> 01:13:36.000
I had a flirt. A fling.

631
01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:39.125
Completely idiotic and meaningless.

632
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:43.582
Quickly done and quickly forgotten.
Many years ago.


633
01:13:43.707 --> 01:13:46.207
During a job in Germany.

634
01:13:49.707 --> 01:13:51.792
I remember.

635
01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:56.957
Your fling sent you a present, right?

636
01:13:58.125 --> 01:14:02.750
The ugliest leather jacket ever.

637
01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:05.292
Stone-washed.

638
01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:07.957
She'd designed it herself.

639
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:13.917
I didn't know you knew.

640
01:14:14.042 --> 01:14:17.457
The funny thing was,
I wasn't jealous at all.


641
01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:22.792
I was immersed in Julie, my baby.

642
01:14:25.332 --> 01:14:28.792
But what really drove me crazy
with jealously,


643
01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:34.542
was your work and your endless
need for acknowledgement.


644
01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:37.875
It's been my greatest rival.

645
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.750
I thought it was unfair you got to work
so much, kept producing all the time.


646
01:14:46.707 --> 01:14:49.292
But it's no longer important.

647
01:14:52.667 --> 01:14:54.750
Any more?

648
01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:57.792
- Anything else to confess?
- No.


649
01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:02.792
Aren't you curious about me?

650
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:15.832
I'm not sure I want to know.

651
01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:19.332
You can relax.

652
01:15:19.457 --> 01:15:23.042
I've been so faithful it's ridiculous.

653
01:15:23.167 --> 01:15:26.250
All I've kissed is our kids' necks.

654
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:33.375
But I've seen something
much more dangerous.


655
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.292
I fell truly in love.

656
01:15:37.832 --> 01:15:42.207
If I'd followed my heart,
I wouldn't have been here now.


657
01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:52.332
Do you regret it?

658
01:15:54.832 --> 01:15:56.417
No.

659
01:15:56.542 --> 01:15:59.457
He wouldn't have been worth it.

660
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:07.167
Should we get home to the kids?

661
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:10.832
Yes.

662
01:16:13.375 --> 01:16:15.792
One more thing.

663
01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:21.207
I take back what I said
about you finding someone else.


664
01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:40.957
Hello!

665
01:16:41.082 --> 01:16:43.875
Hi. Sorry we're late.

666
01:16:45.582 --> 01:16:50.832
- Help yourselves to some pasta.
- It was delicious.


667
01:16:51.917 --> 01:16:54.207
- Really.
- Thanks.


668
01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:01.000
How did it go?

669
01:17:02.082 --> 01:17:04.542
We're getting married.

670
01:17:06.832 --> 01:17:08.917
What happened?

671
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.082
Anja is going to have the tumor
removed on 2 January.


672
01:17:14.207 --> 01:17:17.125
We have to do it before that.

673
01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:19.375
When?

674
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.000
- New Year's Eve.
- Right.


675
01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:27.917
In three days?

676
01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:31.292
But that's your birthday, Mom.

677
01:17:31.375 --> 01:17:35.957
So it's your birthday, wedding
and New Year's Eve all in one?


678
01:17:36.582 --> 01:17:39.167
- That'll be great.
- But...


679
01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:42.000
Where will you get married?

680
01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:44.750
We have a hospital chaplain.

681
01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:49.917
But we're not sure whether we can find
a church on such short notice.


682
01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:55.292
- Do you have to get married in church?
- Either that, or the hospital chapel.


683
01:17:55.417 --> 01:18:00.292
It has to be done by a hospital chaplain
to cut through the red tape.


684
01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:04.125
We're not getting married in a hospital.

685
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:07.957
- No.
- But we're going to have a party?


686
01:18:08.082 --> 01:18:10.457
Of course we'll have a party.

687
01:18:10.582 --> 01:18:15.457
- I don't think we'll be that many.
- Just your hundred closest friends.


688
01:18:15.582 --> 01:18:17.875
I know how to party.

689
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.125
But I'm not a great organizer,
so we'll need help.


690
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:25.792
December 29

691
01:18:32.417 --> 01:18:34.542
Hi.

692
01:18:37.332 --> 01:18:40.250
- You didn't get any sleep.
- No.


693
01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:43.625
Tomas!

694
01:18:46.667 --> 01:18:50.792
We're meeting a researcher
at the Radium Hospital.


695
01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:55.957
He's only given us 20 min.
Tomas has googled treatments in the US.


696
01:18:56.082 --> 01:19:00.417
We need to know what
the researcher thinks. Tomas!


697
01:19:00.542 --> 01:19:03.750
He's so slow it drives me crazy.

698
01:19:06.792 --> 01:19:11.542
Are you sure this isn't too much for you?
I mean...


699
01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:16.167
Do you have to get married now?
Just before the operation?


700
01:19:17.375 --> 01:19:20.125
When should I otherwise do it?

701
01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:24.832
What do you think? With my wedding
and birthday on the same day,


702
01:19:24.957 --> 01:19:28.625
you'll only have to remember me
once a year.


703
01:19:29.957 --> 01:19:33.000
And you'll get fireworks too.

704
01:19:44.082 --> 01:19:46.167
We have to leave.

705
01:20:05.082 --> 01:20:07.917
We're fifteen minutes early.

706
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.792
I have to admit that you're
an interesting case, with complex issues.


707
01:20:24.917 --> 01:20:29.292
Whether and how to treat someone
with your diagnosis.


708
01:20:29.417 --> 01:20:33.875
Most lung cancer patients these days
are truck drivers.


709
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.042
Except for the odd trial lawyer, right?

710
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:43.042
Let's sit down over there.
It's too far to go back to my office.


711
01:20:45.457 --> 01:20:49.917
As I'm sure you already know,
there's no cure in your case.


712
01:20:50.582 --> 01:20:54.957
All we know for sure is that
you will die from this cancer.


713
01:20:55.082 --> 01:21:00.042
My advice is not to waste time
searching for miracle cures abroad.


714
01:21:00.167 --> 01:21:05.042
They don't exist. Or alternative treatment
with no proven effect.


715
01:21:05.167 --> 01:21:10.207
Or brutal life-extending treatment
that will reduce the quality


716
01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:12.792
of the life you have left.

717
01:21:12.917 --> 01:21:16.792
I think all my international
colleagues would agree.


718
01:21:21.457 --> 01:21:24.625
What would you have
done if it were you?

719
01:21:27.625 --> 01:21:32.457
I guess it's easy to say
when you're not in this situation.


720
01:21:32.582 --> 01:21:36.875
I don't think I'd put up a fight.
I'd try to enjoy life,


721
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.917
with wine, good food.

722
01:21:40.042 --> 01:21:45.707
Be with my family. The children,
the four weeks or so that are left.


723
01:21:45.832 --> 01:21:52.625
Instead of four months alone in painful
life-extending treatment at a US hospital.


724
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:55.707
That's what I'd do.

725
01:22:02.832 --> 01:22:05.582
That was a pretty clear message.

726
01:22:05.707 --> 01:22:09.125
No use searching for a miracle cure.

727
01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:14.042
You didn't have to ask that fool
what he would've done.


728
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:25.250
- You wanted to know everything.
- You're not dying. You don't get to ask.


729
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.167
This one's available.

730
01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:43.667
We've actually proposed
to each other several times.


731
01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:49.582
But Tomas was still married
the first time. Then he got separated.


732
01:22:49.707 --> 01:22:53.917
We wanted to have children.
Then we moved.


733
01:22:54.042 --> 01:22:56.667
And had more children.

734
01:22:56.792 --> 01:23:01.875
And work, lots of work.
And sick parents.


735
01:23:02.957 --> 01:23:07.667
Then there was a time when
we both wanted to get married.


736
01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:12.957
But Tomas wanted a big wedding,
and I wanted a small one.


737
01:23:13.082 --> 01:23:19.332
So we never managed to agree. Or rather,
we did set a date many years ago.


738
01:23:19.457 --> 01:23:22.832
Then Tomas got a job on some project.

739
01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:27.832
Well, I can't remember.

740
01:23:27.957 --> 01:23:33.792
There's always been something.
Someone's needs always got in the way.


741
01:23:33.917 --> 01:23:39.875
Before everything turned sour, and we
no longer knew if we wanted each other.


742
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.667
But we decided to try a little longer.
That was last Christmas. Then I fell ill.


743
01:23:45.792 --> 01:23:49.667
Then I recovered, then relapsed.
And here we are.


744
01:23:58.417 --> 01:24:04.000
- Could we get married in church?
- On New Year's Eve? That won't be easy.


745
01:24:04.125 --> 01:24:08.832
Because I don't think Anja
wants to get married in a hospital.


746
01:24:08.957 --> 01:24:11.582
Maybe we could find a chapel?

747
01:24:11.707 --> 01:24:15.542
We won't be that many.
Maybe thirty people.


748
01:24:15.667 --> 01:24:20.750
I'll try to pull some strings.
But I can't promise anything.


749
01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:24.207
I'll get back to
you when I know more.

750
01:24:24.332 --> 01:24:28.457
- I'll call you as soon as I can.
- Thank you.


751
01:24:38.417 --> 01:24:43.875
How crazy was that? He didn't ask
one single question about who we are.


752
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.250
Maybe he didn't get the chance.

753
01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:54.917
He doesn't need to know all the details of
our lives to perform a wedding ceremony.


754
01:24:55.042 --> 01:24:58.417
- Details?
- Maybe it doesn't matter.


755
01:25:00.207 --> 01:25:04.457
I think you describe
us in a shabby way.

756
01:25:04.582 --> 01:25:10.707
You paint our life like a complete grind.
That's not how I remember it.


757
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.957
Then how do you remember it?

758
01:25:16.082 --> 01:25:20.375
I don't know what you see, Tomas.
Give me some new images.


759
01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:27.082
- Don't do this to us.
- We haven't lived the same life.


760
01:25:27.207 --> 01:25:30.625
Life's not... It's not perfect.

761
01:25:37.707 --> 01:25:43.250
All the times you talked about leaving.
But I never wanted to leave you.


762
01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:47.207
It's not easy being where you are now.

763
01:25:47.332 --> 01:25:50.332
But right now you're just ruthless.

764
01:26:08.957 --> 01:26:12.332
December 30

765
01:26:12.875 --> 01:26:15.125
- Pancake?
- Yes please.


766
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.375
- That's your third one.
- No, it's my second.


767
01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.000
- Are you sure?
- I had one, then this one.


768
01:26:25.125 --> 01:26:28.042
Relax, I'll make some more.

769
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:37.957
Vera? Would you be
my maid of honor, with Arthur?


770
01:26:41.207 --> 01:26:43.417
I'd love to.

771
01:26:48.042 --> 01:26:51.250
But what do I have to do?

772
01:26:52.792 --> 01:26:55.750
Walk behind you and hold your veil?

773
01:26:57.375 --> 01:26:59.457
I wouldn't know.

774
01:27:08.042 --> 01:27:10.707
But you'll wear a white dress?

775
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:18.082
Good.

776
01:27:36.082 --> 01:27:40.542
This is what it looks like,
the key to the house of God.


777
01:27:53.875 --> 01:27:56.207
What do you think?

778
01:27:56.332 --> 01:27:58.750
It's freezing cold in here.

779
01:27:58.875 --> 01:28:01.207
Too big. Lacks soul.

780
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:06.250
It's all that's on offer.

781
01:28:07.792 --> 01:28:11.292
I'd rather get married outside
in the cemetery.


782
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:20.000
It's simpler than it looks on the hanger.
It's beautiful. You have to try it on.


783
01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:28.042
You can try it.

784
01:28:32.082 --> 01:28:37.875
There's a mirror here.
You can step up on this box and see.


785
01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.542
Are you feeling sick?

786
01:29:18.667 --> 01:29:20.750
Yes.

787
01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:27.082
Maybe you should take a Vival?

788
01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:34.457
I left them at home.

789
01:29:51.457 --> 01:29:55.917
- Anja? What are you doing here?
- Hi.


790
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.332
Hi.

791
01:29:59.457 --> 01:30:03.000
Hi.
I got your message.


792
01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:06.875
- I'm all yours tomorrow.
- Are you home already?


793
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.875
I just have to fetch something.
Tomas is waiting in the car. Hi, Frans.


794
01:30:14.082 --> 01:30:18.917
I can't even imagine what it's like
to be you right now.


795
01:30:19.042 --> 01:30:23.625
- Hi, boys. I just have to fetch something.
- Don't peek into my room.


796
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:26.167
It's a secret!

797
01:30:26.292 --> 01:30:30.207
Mom? What are you doing at home?

798
01:30:30.332 --> 01:30:35.082
I just had to take care of something
before we go to the hospital.


799
01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:43.000
- Why aren't you out there with the others?
- They're fussing about.


800
01:30:43.125 --> 01:30:46.625
Like it's a perfectly ordinary wedding.

801
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:55.082
But you're my mom.

802
01:30:55.207 --> 01:30:59.417
I have to run, Julie.
We'll be getting the results.


803
01:30:59.542 --> 01:31:02.292
Can't I come with you?

804
01:31:02.417 --> 01:31:04.832
I'm afraid not.

805
01:31:16.292 --> 01:31:18.417
Hi.

806
01:31:22.417 --> 01:31:25.125
Anja...

807
01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:29.750
Your CT scans are clean.
No metastases in your lungs.


808
01:31:33.957 --> 01:31:36.292
Anja?

809
01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:39.832
Let's see. I think...

810
01:31:39.957 --> 01:31:43.667
Take hold of her.
Come over here.


811
01:31:44.417 --> 01:31:49.042
Take a deep breath. Okay?
Take my hand. Breathe.


812
01:31:49.167 --> 01:31:53.832
The surgeon was supposed to tell you,
but I just couldn't wait.


813
01:32:03.832 --> 01:32:06.082
Yes.

814
01:32:06.207 --> 01:32:08.457
No, no.

815
01:32:08.582 --> 01:32:12.417
He's older than me,
but I'm the one who's ill.


816
01:32:14.167 --> 01:32:16.250
We're getting married.

817
01:32:37.082 --> 01:32:41.582
Hey, I no longer want to know
how much time they think I have left.


818
01:32:41.707 --> 01:32:45.417
So I'm not going to ask.

819
01:32:46.207 --> 01:32:50.500
You can sit here.
There's room for you on the bench.


820
01:32:53.625 --> 01:32:57.917
Sorry I called you at home
during the holidays.


821
01:32:58.042 --> 01:33:04.207
Don't worry about that. It's not hard
to understand in your situation. Alright.


822
01:33:04.332 --> 01:33:08.500
I assume you aren't well,
but how is your headache now?


823
01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:11.750
Is it better or worse than before?

824
01:33:11.875 --> 01:33:14.292
- It's better.
- Good.


825
01:33:14.417 --> 01:33:20.625
What I'm going to do now, is explain
what'll happen during the operation.


826
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:24.957
So you won't have to speculate.
So you'll both know.


827
01:33:27.292 --> 01:33:33.207
Here are the MRI images from December 23.

828
01:33:33.332 --> 01:33:38.167
And this is where
the metastasis is located.


829
01:33:38.292 --> 01:33:44.332
It's to the right in the image, but it's
in the back of your left hemisphere.


830
01:33:44.457 --> 01:33:46.457
And... May I touch you?

831
01:33:46.582 --> 01:33:52.875
We'll enter through a 20 cm incision
in the back of your head,


832
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.042
up to about here,
to remove the metastasis.


833
01:33:58.167 --> 01:34:03.207
The grayish, dark area around here,
that's the edema, the fluid.


834
01:34:03.332 --> 01:34:09.792
It should be substantially smaller now
as a result of the Medrol treatment.


835
01:34:09.917 --> 01:34:15.957
If the operation is a success, the results
of the CAT scan of your lungs


836
01:34:16.082 --> 01:34:19.750
might give us a reason
to perform a PET scan


837
01:34:19.875 --> 01:34:24.500
to see if it's spread to
any other areas in your body.


838
01:34:25.332 --> 01:34:27.957
But it all depends on the operation.

839
01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:32.542
May I ask a question?

840
01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.375
Yes.

841
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:39.667
What's the risk involved in the surgery
besides the metastasis itself?


842
01:34:39.792 --> 01:34:44.250
At worst, the operation
may damage the visual cortex


843
01:34:44.375 --> 01:34:49.582
and your peripheral vision permanently.
You won't be able to drive.


844
01:34:49.707 --> 01:34:54.457
I don't need to. But I don't want to be
a zombie bride. I must sleep.


845
01:34:54.582 --> 01:35:00.832
I want to be myself. All I want now
is to sleep one whole night through!


846
01:35:00.957 --> 01:35:04.457
Can I please get off the Medrol?

847
01:35:04.582 --> 01:35:11.125
You can't go to zero, but if you halve
the Medrol dose, you'll sleep better.


848
01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:16.792
- Thank you.
- The reduction may lead to depression.


849
01:35:16.917 --> 01:35:22.500
So make sure she doesn't start
talking nonsense before the operation.


850
01:35:22.625 --> 01:35:25.667
- "Nonsense"?
- It probably won't happen.


851
01:35:25.792 --> 01:35:32.042
But high doses can trigger a psychosis.
Based on what I see and hear now,


852
01:35:32.167 --> 01:35:36.125
she should halve her dose immediately.

853
01:35:43.957 --> 01:35:47.332
This was my mom's wedding dress.

854
01:35:53.417 --> 01:35:55.250
I've kept it.

855
01:35:58.167 --> 01:36:00.832
Thanks, Vera, but no.

856
01:36:04.332 --> 01:36:08.082
I want to wear my own dress.
The dark green one.


857
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:12.375
It's too somber.

858
01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.957
No.

859
01:36:15.082 --> 01:36:18.167
It's dark, not black like in a funeral.

860
01:36:37.582 --> 01:36:40.500
Vera...

861
01:36:40.625 --> 01:36:42.457
I'm sorry.

862
01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:48.875
You're not the one who's
supposed to comfort me.


863
01:37:04.375 --> 01:37:08.125
Did you halve your dose of Medrol?

864
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:14.457
- And took a sleeping pill?
- Yes.


865
01:37:17.082 --> 01:37:20.332
You need to sleep now.

866
01:37:21.707 --> 01:37:25.500
You need to sleep
for tomorrow to be a good day.


867
01:37:31.917 --> 01:37:35.250
New Year's Eve

868
01:37:58.707 --> 01:38:01.875
Hurray, hurray, hurray!

869
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.957
Happy birthday!

870
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:10.250
Happy birthday, Mom.

871
01:38:13.582 --> 01:38:17.167
What would you like, Anja?
French toast, yoghurt?


872
01:38:17.292 --> 01:38:19.957
I'm not that hungry, but thanks.

873
01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:24.375
But you do want
a cup of Vera's fancy coffee?


874
01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.832
Thank you.

875
01:38:27.582 --> 01:38:29.667
Happy birthday.

876
01:38:34.292 --> 01:38:38.125
You slept the whole night through.
Like a log.


877
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:42.125
- Really?
- You look rested.


878
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.207
My batteries are dead.

879
01:38:50.625 --> 01:38:52.625
Anja, I have to leave now.

880
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:56.167
Arthur will pick you
up here in two hours.

881
01:38:57.457 --> 01:38:59.582
Where's Mom going?

882
01:39:00.917 --> 01:39:06.207
- We've got secret plans for Mom.
- I hate secrets.


883
01:39:06.332 --> 01:39:08.417
I can imagine.

884
01:39:27.207 --> 01:39:33.417
It won't be a white dress, Julie. I tried
to get one, but it didn't work out.


885
01:39:35.167 --> 01:39:37.625
It's not that important.

886
01:39:38.707 --> 01:39:40.792
It's not.

887
01:39:42.832 --> 01:39:46.250
- Are you disappointed?
- Aren't you?


888
01:39:46.375 --> 01:39:48.707
No.

889
01:39:48.832 --> 01:39:51.875
Maybe it's not that kind of wedding.

890
01:39:52.917 --> 01:39:56.125
I'm not saying it's a shotgun wedding.

891
01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:58.250
Just...

892
01:40:04.292 --> 01:40:08.750
- Are you nervous?
- Anja? Phone call.


893
01:40:13.417 --> 01:40:16.792
- Is it Arthur?
- No, unknown number.


894
01:40:18.792 --> 01:40:20.875
Hello?

895
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:28.792
I don't think we've spoken earlier.

896
01:40:29.832 --> 01:40:33.582
Maybe you should speak
to Tomas yourself? Tomas!


897
01:40:35.042 --> 01:40:36.832
I see.

898
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:49.125
Thank you, but that's enough. I've already
agreed a date with the operating surgeon.


899
01:40:51.125 --> 01:40:53.792
This is about my life, not yours.

900
01:41:00.082 --> 01:41:05.542
Do you have some sort of agreement
with a crazy surgeon called Ulseth?


901
01:41:05.667 --> 01:41:09.375
He says you agreed
he'd perform the operation.


902
01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:13.792
We spoke informally via phone
while I was doing research.


903
01:41:13.917 --> 01:41:20.042
- It was before I knew it was operable.
- He chewed me out for jumping in line.


904
01:41:20.167 --> 01:41:23.667
Said the timing didn't matter
because there's no hope.


905
01:41:23.792 --> 01:41:27.375
My god, how can he say that?

906
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:32.667
Anja, I haven't agreed anything
with that humiliated surgeon.


907
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:40.875
I've got the jitters.

908
01:41:43.957 --> 01:41:46.832
Vera and I know nothing about weddings.

909
01:41:46.957 --> 01:41:51.582
- You're the only one with any experience.
- It's been a while.


910
01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:58.125
I was four years old
the last time Tomas got married.


911
01:42:00.082 --> 01:42:03.500
- Shall we go?
- Yes.


912
01:42:03.625 --> 01:42:08.792
Google says the groom shouldn't see
the bride until she comes up the aisle.


913
01:42:08.917 --> 01:42:11.207
We'll take care of her.

914
01:42:11.332 --> 01:42:14.417
- You take care of yourself.
- Thanks.


915
01:42:32.832 --> 01:42:36.042
Have you thought about how you want it?

916
01:42:39.625 --> 01:42:42.207
You really have wonderful hair.

917
01:42:44.332 --> 01:42:47.750
Hi.
I finally found something white for you.


918
01:42:47.875 --> 01:42:51.167
Or rather for Julie.

919
01:42:51.292 --> 01:42:54.417
The shop wasn't really open. Look!

920
01:42:54.542 --> 01:42:57.625
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Very. Thanks.


921
01:42:58.917 --> 01:43:04.667
Tomas is downstairs with Frans, who wants
to say hi. Didn't know he was best man.


922
01:43:04.792 --> 01:43:07.000
- Are they here now?
- Yes.


923
01:43:08.957 --> 01:43:13.667
Yes. Tomas...
He wanted a haircut.


924
01:43:15.125 --> 01:43:21.625
All the other hairdressers are closed,
so I got an appointment for both of you.


925
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:25.375
- It's on the house.
- Thank you.


926
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:28.332
Hi. How's the bride doing?

927
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:45.582
Anja...

928
01:43:46.582 --> 01:43:53.292
Didn't you hear what Arthur said? You're
supposed to leave me alone until church.


929
01:43:53.417 --> 01:43:58.625
Can't you see that all this is too late,
this whole ridiculous setup?


930
01:43:58.750 --> 01:44:03.042
Did it take a death sentence for you
to forget about yourself,


931
01:44:03.167 --> 01:44:06.832
and suddenly do everything right?

932
01:44:06.957 --> 01:44:09.750
Now that it's all over anyway?

933
01:44:11.292 --> 01:44:16.457
How can I walk down the aisle
without thinking it's my own funeral?


934
01:44:19.832 --> 01:44:24.125
I've been such a coward.
I should've left you ages ago.


935
01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:27.000
But I've been too exhausted.

936
01:44:27.125 --> 01:44:32.292
I've been eaten alive
by you and the kids.


937
01:44:32.832 --> 01:44:37.500
And now I'm stuck here,
feeling like an ungrateful fool.


938
01:44:37.625 --> 01:44:40.707
Unable to accept anything from you.

939
01:44:56.625 --> 01:44:59.042
You don't want to?

940
01:46:42.457 --> 01:46:44.750
Anja...

941
01:46:44.875 --> 01:46:46.875
Yes.

942
01:48:02.832 --> 01:48:09.792
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God
our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.


943
01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:16.042
Dear Anja and Tomas. You have come here
to enter into matrimony.


944
01:48:16.167 --> 01:48:19.292
We have gathered to celebrate with...

945
01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:08.750
...to have and to hold, for better,
for worse, for richer, for poorer,


946
01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:11.125
until death do you part?

947
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:13.332
I do.

948
01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:26.832
Thank you.
Thank you so much, everyone.


949
01:50:26.957 --> 01:50:29.042
Shit!

950
01:50:37.582 --> 01:50:39.667
Hi, Isak.

951
01:50:58.792 --> 01:51:05.750
About twenty years ago,
I saw two people fall in love.


952
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:11.332
Something both those involved denied.

953
01:51:13.082 --> 01:51:18.792
But I was convinced
they were having an affair.


954
01:51:18.917 --> 01:51:24.207
Though I was also certain
it would soon blow over.


955
01:51:24.332 --> 01:51:27.250
I wasn't the only one who thought so.

956
01:51:32.957 --> 01:51:37.332
Their love seemed impossible.
And I...


957
01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:40.625
I seem to remember that you, Anja...

958
01:51:42.292 --> 01:51:46.957
You were furious that
you'd fallen in love with Tomas.


959
01:51:47.082 --> 01:51:50.125
It didn't suit your plans at all.

960
01:51:51.082 --> 01:51:56.542
But it's never been more evident
that you're meant for each other.


961
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:04.832
No, what the...?

962
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.082
Darn it. Right.

963
01:52:09.207 --> 01:52:11.457
Let's take it from the top.

964
01:52:11.582 --> 01:52:14.667
This is my gift to you.

965
01:52:17.332 --> 01:52:19.667
You can start it now.

966
01:52:29.667 --> 01:52:34.000
My ruminations and sad songs are gone

967
01:52:34.125 --> 01:52:38.375
They never helped me get nothing done

968
01:52:42.125 --> 01:52:46.125
All the good will
and love in the world

969
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:50.457
Is what it takes for my little girl

970
01:52:52.582 --> 01:52:57.332
Should I just cry out? 
Would it help?

971
01:52:57.457 --> 01:53:02.207
When I close my eyes, I see myself

972
01:53:05.457 --> 01:53:09.875
In acrobatic, euphoric high

973
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.332
Heading to see my

974
01:53:13.457 --> 01:53:15.500
Cutie pie

975
01:53:23.457 --> 01:53:27.750
You'll never miss the good old lies

976
01:53:27.875 --> 01:53:32.250
We're gonna kiss till Jesus cries

977
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:39.750
You're afraid that it's too far to go

978
01:53:39.875 --> 01:53:44.042
How fast I'll run, you'll never know

979
01:53:46.457 --> 01:53:51.082
If you would give me right of way

980
01:53:51.207 --> 01:53:55.542
I'd grant you access every day

981
01:53:55.667 --> 01:54:01.207
And I can smile
Beat up myself


982
01:54:01.332 --> 01:54:04.667
I've got theatrics

983
01:54:04.792 --> 01:54:07.625
If nothing else

984
01:54:08.667 --> 01:54:13.375
When you bring me all of you

985
01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:16.250
Unbearable, for still

986
01:54:18.332 --> 01:54:20.792
My heart is split in two

987
01:54:22.875 --> 01:54:25.375
Romance makes me ill

988
01:54:39.707 --> 01:54:43.832
- I don't know what to say.
- What about "Happy New Year"?


989
01:54:44.832 --> 01:54:49.875
I have to say it. I hope for the best.
But I'll be here if I'm needed.


990
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.917
Ready to take care of the kids.

991
01:55:02.582 --> 01:55:07.582
I shouldn't have said that.
But I can't stop thinking about it.


992
01:55:09.250 --> 01:55:13.207
Thank you, Vera,
but the kids have a father.


993
01:55:50.707 --> 01:55:52.792
Julie?

994
01:56:04.792 --> 01:56:07.625
I didn't know you existed.

995
01:56:17.375 --> 01:56:21.457
I wish I could take you with me
in the afterlife.


996
01:56:23.332 --> 01:56:26.707
New Year's Day

997
01:56:31.667 --> 01:56:35.292
I'm trying to imagine who you were.

998
01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:41.792
Why haven't you told us
about any of this before?


999
01:56:41.917 --> 01:56:45.332
There's so much I didn't know.

1000
01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:50.167
All those secrets before I was born.

1001
01:56:53.832 --> 01:56:56.832
All the grown-ups were so different.

1002
01:57:00.375 --> 01:57:03.625
More direct than I've ever seen before.

1003
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:11.625
At least you two.

1004
01:57:15.250 --> 01:57:17.332
Different how?

1005
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:23.125
I didn't know you could be
so loving to each other.


1006
01:57:24.582 --> 01:57:28.792
Like I've never seen before. I mean...

1007
01:57:28.917 --> 01:57:31.832
Maybe once, one summer, ages ago.

1008
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:40.292
Just like two kids.

1009
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.375
January 2

1010
01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.832
Just a moment.

1011
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.332
There. I'm afraid you can't enter
the operating theatre.


1012
01:58:36.417 --> 01:58:39.250
I'll be here when you wake up.
