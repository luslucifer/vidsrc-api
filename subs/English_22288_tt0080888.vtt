00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:56.874
It's beautiful.
Oh, hi, babe.


164
00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:58.241
Oh, you look good,

165
00:10:58.242 --> 00:11:00.010
But you smell
like a cesspool.


166
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:01.144
Where you been?

167
00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:03.213
Let me tell you,

168
00:11:03.214 --> 00:11:04.615
That horse was harder
to load on that bus


169
00:11:04.616 --> 00:11:06.617
Than you ever were.

170
00:11:06.618 --> 00:11:08.218
Jamie:
Isn't she pretty, mama?


171
00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:10.320
Oh, honey,
she's beautiful.


172
00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:13.790
Look at his rump.
Big and wide.


173
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:15.158
Runs in the family.

174
00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.577
I beg your pardon.
Wait a minute.


175
00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:19.746
I'm pickin' real good, papa.
Did mama tell you?


176
00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:22.416
I thought you was gonna
grow up to be respectable.


177
00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:25.052
I'm gonna stretch him out,
papa. See you later.


178
00:11:25.053 --> 00:11:25.986
Take it easy, son.

179
00:11:27.722 --> 00:11:29.272
Gotta get these off.

180
00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:31.174
Oh, honey. Come on.

181
00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:44.354
Mmm...

182
00:11:47.892 --> 00:11:50.426
Each time
seems longer.


183
00:11:50.427 --> 00:11:51.528
Yeah.

184
00:12:00.872 --> 00:12:03.457
Ha ha ha!

185
00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:05.793
Ha ha ha!

186
00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.296
Mmm!

187
00:12:09.297 --> 00:12:11.515
When did you
do that?


188

[humming]

190
00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:35.071
Hey, Jamie, I think you need
a little more ice over there.


191
00:12:35.072 --> 00:12:37.474
I think what we need is
one with a motor on it.


192
00:12:37.475 --> 00:12:39.176
This is hard.

193
00:12:39.177 --> 00:12:41.845
Ah, when I was a kid, I used
to churn butter for my mom.


194
00:12:41.846 --> 00:12:43.413
<i>That was hard work.</i>

195
00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:45.549
Your mama told me you didn't
do a lick of nothin'


196
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.886
Except hide by the creek
playing that $5.00 guitar.


197
00:12:48.887 --> 00:12:50.938
Guess times haven't
changed too much,


198
00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:51.855
Huh, ma?

199
00:12:51.856 --> 00:12:53.690
Out of the mouths
of babes.


200
00:12:58.596 --> 00:13:00.597
Hey, why don't you
come over here


201
00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:03.133
And pluck this $5.00 guitar?
Let me do that.


202
00:13:03.134 --> 00:13:05.402
Ok. Thanks.

203
00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:07.437
You know that song
I was just playing?


204
00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:10.139
I think I heard it.

205
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.309
Starts off in "a,"
then goes to "d."

you're a cowboy %%

get there, it's gone %%


210
00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:33.230
Jamie, that's terrific.

211
00:13:33.231 --> 00:13:35.549
What say we try it?
Ready?


212
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.550
Let's do it.

213
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.761
Oh, looks good.

214
00:13:47.762 --> 00:13:50.597
Oh, boy. Looks great.
How's it taste?


215
00:13:50.598 --> 00:13:51.832
Good.

216
00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:53.717
Yeah? Mmm.

217
00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:56.653
Jamie: Wait a minute, dad.
What about me?


218
00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:58.539
[laughing]

219
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.157
Open up.

Mmm!

Aah!

00:14:11.936 --> 00:14:13.971
Are you serious?

You did--

Oh!

That's funny, dad!

Ha ha ha!

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:36.076
No! Oh! Oh!

00:14:36.077 --> 00:14:38.078
Get mommy.

No, you--oh, blecch!

Blecch?

Blecch!

241
00:14:44.052 --> 00:14:45.552
This is fun.

242
00:14:45.553 --> 00:14:48.055
Oh! Oh!

243
00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:50.273
Hey, Jamie, why don't
you clean this up


244
00:14:50.274 --> 00:14:52.726
While me and mom
go play?


245
00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:55.729
No! Aah! Ha ha!

246
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.430
You go play.

247
00:14:57.431 --> 00:14:59.233
That's my daddy.

248
00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:06.973
Hey. Hey, wait a minute.

249
00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:08.725
Where you going?
It's past your bedtime.


250
00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:11.795
Gonna catch some fireflies.
Give me a couple minutes.


251
00:15:11.796 --> 00:15:13.797
Buck: I haven't heard
a screen door slam


252
00:15:13.798 --> 00:15:15.983
Or smelled fresh-cut hay
all Summer.


253
00:15:15.984 --> 00:15:17.751
Or you.

254
00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:26.827
When you're on the road,

255
00:15:26.828 --> 00:15:28.862
Do you sleep with many
other women, buck?


256
00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:40.774
No, I don't.

257
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:44.477
Not many or none at all?

258
00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:58.025
I was feeling really down
the other night.


259
00:15:58.026 --> 00:16:01.461
I had a glass of wine.

260
00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:05.498
You left half a joint layin'
on your desk, and I smoked it.


261
00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:09.169
I don't know how
you could possibly


262
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.671
Smoke that stuff very often

263
00:16:10.672 --> 00:16:13.273
And not want to go to bed with
someone when you're all alone.


264
00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:25.085
I got to finish making
potato salad for tomorrow.

to do with it all.


484
00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:06.936
Come back on the road
with me.


485
00:33:06.937 --> 00:33:08.771
Come on, honey.

486
00:33:08.772 --> 00:33:11.974
We need to be together.
We need each other.


487
00:33:11.975 --> 00:33:12.975
It's true.

488
00:33:12.976 --> 00:33:14.927
Then come back
on the road.


489
00:33:14.928 --> 00:33:17.530
Honey, we've been
through that before.


490
00:33:17.531 --> 00:33:20.500
I cannot live on a bus
with 14 people.


491
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:22.502
I can't. I've tried.

492
00:33:22.503 --> 00:33:24.420
Every time I ask you
for a real answer,


493
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:26.289
You say,
"come on the road."


494
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.591
That is a real answer. People
do raise families on the road.


495
00:33:28.592 --> 00:33:30.208
You know what
I really think?


496
00:33:30.209 --> 00:33:32.360
I've got to tell you
how I feel.


497
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:34.680
I feel most of the time
you don't want a family.


498
00:33:34.681 --> 00:33:36.281
You make all your
efforts for strangers,


499
00:33:36.282 --> 00:33:37.516
People who don't
even know you.


500
00:33:37.517 --> 00:33:38.684
None for us!

501
00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:41.554
You treat Jamie and me
like an audience.


502
00:33:41.555 --> 00:33:43.523
You pop in, sing a song,
then you're gone again,


503
00:33:43.524 --> 00:33:45.391
And we're supposed to be
glad you came through town!


504
00:33:45.392 --> 00:33:47.459
That's what I do. I pop in,
I sing a song,


505
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.061
And then I'm gonna again.
And I like it.


506
00:33:49.062 --> 00:33:51.663
No wonder. All you have
to do is remember the words.


507
00:33:51.664 --> 00:33:54.967
Nobody on the road asks
more of you than that, buck!


508
00:33:54.968 --> 00:33:56.385
That's just not true.

509
00:33:56.386 --> 00:33:58.504
It is true. If it isn't,
you tell me what is.


510
00:33:58.505 --> 00:34:01.173
What's gonna happen
when it all goes pfft?


511
00:34:01.174 --> 00:34:05.143
Are those people going to be
waiting out there for you?


512
00:34:05.144 --> 00:34:07.529
Well, you know
I can't quit.


513
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.332
I have never asked you
to quit, honey.


514
00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:12.618
I just want you
to stay home more.


515
00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:15.254
But I can't even slow down,
not right now.


516
00:34:15.255 --> 00:34:18.156
All right, I'm gonna
ask you something, ok?


517
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.660
Really.

518
00:34:22.995 --> 00:34:27.199
Is there ever going
to be a time...


519
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.468
When you are
gonna slow down?


520
00:34:38.645 --> 00:34:40.913
Ever?

521
00:34:49.656 --> 00:34:51.624
Ok.

522
00:34:52.509 --> 00:34:54.010
It's just not
gonna work out.


523
00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:55.211
Yeah, bye.

524
00:34:55.212 --> 00:34:57.646
Longley signed with Ray price.
We can't get him.


525
00:34:57.647 --> 00:34:58.714
How you doin'?

526
00:34:58.715 --> 00:35:00.016
Ok. No, no, no.

527
00:35:00.017 --> 00:35:01.884
Talk to you later,
ma. Thanks.


528
00:35:01.885 --> 00:35:02.951
No good. Everybody--

529
00:35:02.952 --> 00:35:04.420
Buddy Lewis,
Frank Dunne,


530
00:35:04.421 --> 00:35:05.704
Bill Rabe,
Berkeley Edwards--


531
00:35:05.705 --> 00:35:07.390
They're all committed
somewhere else.


532
00:35:07.391 --> 00:35:08.857
We can get this
new kid, though,


533
00:35:08.858 --> 00:35:10.159
In about

534
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.427
His name
is Cotton Roberts.


535
00:35:11.428 --> 00:35:12.812
Buck:
Sound like a rabbit.


536
00:35:12.813 --> 00:35:14.312
Maybe he is a rabbit.

537
00:35:14.313 --> 00:35:15.647
Nah, I hear
he's pretty good.


538
00:35:15.648 --> 00:35:17.600
Yeah, but what are we
gonna do for 3 weeks?


539
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:20.252
Go fishin'?
Got dates to play.


540
00:35:20.253 --> 00:35:24.023
I'll talk garland into going
back out for a little while.


541
00:35:24.024 --> 00:35:25.925
Oh, no, honey,
don't do that.


542
00:35:25.926 --> 00:35:27.927
No, rosella
laid down the law.


543
00:35:27.928 --> 00:35:30.496
She just said it right to him,
"if you go, I'm goin',


544
00:35:30.497 --> 00:35:32.748
But I'm goin'
in the other direction."


545
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.021
I just had a thought.

546
00:35:40.022 --> 00:35:42.791
I mean, it's off the wall.

547
00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:45.026
We're talkin' about

548
00:35:45.027 --> 00:35:46.562
So what about Lily?

549
00:35:46.563 --> 00:35:47.546
Lily?

550
00:35:47.547 --> 00:35:48.497
Garland's daughter.

551
00:35:48.498 --> 00:35:49.865
Lily Ramsey.
Right.


552
00:35:49.866 --> 00:35:52.051
Hey, buck.
That's good show business.


553
00:35:53.487 --> 00:35:55.404
No, I don't like it.

554
00:35:55.405 --> 00:35:56.772
It was your idea.

555
00:35:56.773 --> 00:35:57.990
I don't care.
It's dirty pool.


556
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:59.992
I mean, garland came home
to be with his family.


557
00:35:59.993 --> 00:36:02.461
Yeah, but, hey, he shouldn't
hold me up like this.


558
00:36:02.462 --> 00:36:04.163
And it is only 3 weeks.

559
00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.184
Come on, what's 3 weeks?

560
00:36:10.937 --> 00:36:12.872
Well...

561
00:36:12.873 --> 00:36:15.141
Yeah, it is.
It's only 3 weeks.


562
00:36:18.128 --> 00:36:22.030
Buck: It's only gonna be
for 2 or 3 weeks, garland.


563
00:36:22.031 --> 00:36:23.632
You said 4.

564
00:36:23.633 --> 00:36:25.134
Bring me another beer.

565
00:36:25.135 --> 00:36:26.668
You want one?

566
00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:27.719
Make it 2.

567
00:36:30.657 --> 00:36:33.825
Why don't you come back on
the road with us, garland?


568
00:36:33.826 --> 00:36:36.261
At least until old Cotton
what's-his-ass gets free.


569
00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:37.462
Hell,
I don't trust myself.


570
00:36:37.463 --> 00:36:40.332
I'd go out, well,
I'm liable to stay out.


571
00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:42.001
Rosella'd kill me.

572
00:36:45.171 --> 00:36:48.173
If Lily was a boy,
you'd let her go.


573
00:36:48.174 --> 00:36:49.674
Yeah, probably.

574
00:36:49.675 --> 00:36:52.461
But I ain't sure
that I want my baby girl


575
00:36:52.462 --> 00:36:55.697
On that gol-dang bus
with them fellers.


576
00:36:59.669 --> 00:37:02.271
Lily ain't much of a baby
anymore, garland.


577
00:37:02.272 --> 00:37:04.190
You took a look
at her lately?


578
00:37:04.191 --> 00:37:05.824
Yeah.
That's what I mean.


579
00:37:10.897 --> 00:37:12.014
[knocking]

580
00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:18.604
Hey, daddy.

581
00:37:18.605 --> 00:37:19.605
Hello, baby.

582
00:37:19.606 --> 00:37:20.673
What you doin' here?

583
00:37:20.674 --> 00:37:21.707
How's my girl?

584
00:37:21.708 --> 00:37:23.242
I'm great.
How you doin'?


585
00:37:23.243 --> 00:37:24.276
Hey, what you up to?

586
00:37:24.277 --> 00:37:25.277
Not much.

587
00:37:25.278 --> 00:37:26.445
Hey, you want some coffee?

588
00:37:26.446 --> 00:37:28.147
Yeah. That'd be
really good.


589
00:37:28.148 --> 00:37:29.115
Sit on down.

590
00:37:31.718 --> 00:37:33.953
Doggone it.

591
00:37:33.954 --> 00:37:35.620
You got a lot
of my friends up there.


592
00:37:35.621 --> 00:37:36.722
Yup.

593
00:37:38.858 --> 00:37:40.892
Hey, Lily.

594
00:37:40.893 --> 00:37:43.228
Have you seen
my blue shirt? Oh.


595
00:37:43.229 --> 00:37:45.464
Daddy,
that's dorsey Lee.


596
00:37:45.465 --> 00:37:47.917
Dorsey Lee,
that's my daddy.


597
00:37:47.918 --> 00:37:49.251
Good to meet you.

598
00:37:49.252 --> 00:37:50.285
Howdy.

599
00:37:50.286 --> 00:37:52.220
I sure admire your music.

600
00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:53.689
Yeah.

601
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.657
Hey. Good mornin'.

602
00:37:55.658 --> 00:37:56.942
Mornin'.

603
00:37:58.895 --> 00:38:00.729
Oh, daddy.

604
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.464
Well, goddamn it, Lily.

605
00:38:02.465 --> 00:38:04.466
Daddy, I'm 22 now.

606
00:38:04.467 --> 00:38:06.702
All growed up
and haired over.


607
00:38:06.703 --> 00:38:08.737
Lily,
just listen to you talk.


608
00:38:08.738 --> 00:38:09.672
[giggles]

609
00:38:11.775 --> 00:38:14.009
I was kind of hopin' that...

610
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.645
Well, maybe you could
live at home this Summer.


611
00:38:16.646 --> 00:38:18.146
Yeah, well,
I just kind of wanted


612
00:38:18.147 --> 00:38:20.348
A place of my own,
you know?


613
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:22.585
I'll come visiting you
a lot.


614
00:38:22.586 --> 00:38:25.487
Yeah, I-
-I reckon.

615
00:38:25.488 --> 00:38:27.006
Oh, uh...

616
00:38:27.007 --> 00:38:28.924
Buck's thinkin'
about askin' you


617
00:38:28.925 --> 00:38:32.193
To go out on the road
with him for a while.


618
00:38:32.194 --> 00:38:35.264
Are you kiddin' me?

619
00:38:35.265 --> 00:38:36.432
What did you tell him?

620
00:38:36.433 --> 00:38:38.901
Well, it'd just be
for a couple of weeks


621
00:38:38.902 --> 00:38:42.087
Till Cotton Roberts
could take the job.


622
00:38:42.088 --> 00:38:43.455
You wouldn't want to go out

623
00:38:43.456 --> 00:38:46.275
On a little old squirt
like that, now, would you?


624
00:38:46.276 --> 00:38:49.277
Yes, I would, daddy,
I really would.


625
00:38:49.278 --> 00:38:52.280
God, I'm a musician.
Of course I want to go.


626
00:38:52.281 --> 00:38:54.933
Oh, Lily, one-night stands.

627
00:38:54.934 --> 00:38:58.804
Gets real rowdy on that bus
and in them motels.


628
00:38:58.805 --> 00:39:01.573
Partyin' and the drinkin'.

629
00:39:01.574 --> 00:39:03.191
You don't want to go
on the road.


630
00:39:03.192 --> 00:39:05.860
How do you know
what I want?


631
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:08.997
You don't know anything
about me, do you, daddy?


632
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.343
It's not morning yet.

633
00:39:21.344 --> 00:39:23.345
Yeah, I know.
I can't sleep.


634
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.624
You know, I've been thinking
about dedicating


635
00:39:36.625 --> 00:39:39.995
That whole labor day concert
to garland this year.


636
00:39:39.996 --> 00:39:41.396
What do you think?

637
00:39:43.666 --> 00:39:45.467
Oh, it sounds really nice.

638
00:39:45.468 --> 00:39:47.702
He'd probably
really like that.


639
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:02.801
What do you think

640
00:40:02.802 --> 00:40:04.869
About you and I taking
some time off this year


641
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:05.938
After the concert,

642
00:40:05.939 --> 00:40:08.206
Going away somewhere,
just you and me?


643
00:40:08.207 --> 00:40:10.475
Would you like that?

644
00:40:10.476 --> 00:40:11.776
I'd love it.

645
00:40:13.863 --> 00:40:17.766
I really mean it, Viv.

646
00:40:17.767 --> 00:40:20.936
Every time you say it
you mean it, buck.


647
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.841
Just do me a favor, ok?

648
00:40:25.842 --> 00:40:29.077
Don't mention anything to Jamie
about taking time off.


649
00:40:31.347 --> 00:40:32.664
Why not?

650
00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:33.966
'cause he'll believe it.

651
00:40:44.293 --> 00:40:47.228
I do love you, Viv.

652
00:40:47.229 --> 00:40:49.097
I know you do.

653
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.734
I know it.

654
00:40:52.735 --> 00:40:54.536
I love you, too.

655
00:41:01.644 --> 00:41:03.812
I'll be down
by the creek.


656
00:41:14.107 --> 00:41:17.375
Buck: %% feel comfortable %%

657
00:41:17.376 --> 00:41:19.611

658

660
00:41:28.788 --> 00:41:29.821
Ok.

661
00:41:29.822 --> 00:41:31.089
Thanks.

662
00:41:32.825 --> 00:41:35.460

I will, daddy.

669
00:41:52.595 --> 00:41:53.628
Don't you worry,
garland.


670
00:41:53.629 --> 00:41:54.963
We'll take real good
care of her.


671
00:41:54.964 --> 00:41:55.997
Bye-bye, honey.

672
00:41:55.998 --> 00:41:57.383
Don't you forget
to come back.


673
00:41:57.384 --> 00:41:58.550
Well, I'm glad that
we talked it out,


674
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:00.602
Said what we had to say,
aren't you?


675
00:42:00.603 --> 00:42:01.553
Yeah.

676
00:42:01.554 --> 00:42:04.556
Why don't you and Jamie
just show up?


677
00:42:04.557 --> 00:42:05.423
Really?
Yeah.


678
00:42:05.424 --> 00:42:06.725
Where?

679
00:42:06.726 --> 00:42:08.326
Anywhere.
Surprise me.


680
00:42:08.327 --> 00:42:10.979
Ok, I will.

681
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.980
See y'all. Love you.

682
00:42:11.981 --> 00:42:12.981
Bye, hon.

683
00:42:12.982 --> 00:42:14.182
Sid: Garland, rosella.

684
00:42:14.183 --> 00:42:15.984
Buck wants to know just
how embarrassed you'd be


685
00:42:15.985 --> 00:42:17.185
If we threw the whole
labor day concert


686
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:18.353
In your honor.

687
00:42:18.354 --> 00:42:19.887
Rosella: Ha ha. Sid.

688
00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:24.576
Tex: Oh, I think
I'm in love.


689
00:42:24.577 --> 00:42:27.145
Hey, garland.

690
00:42:27.146 --> 00:42:30.982
Buck, Sid told me what you
got planned for labor day.


691
00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:32.284
I kind of like it.

692
00:42:32.285 --> 00:42:34.887
Yeah. I kind of like
you, too, garland.


693
00:42:34.888 --> 00:42:36.522
They ought to make
a statue out of you


694
00:42:36.523 --> 00:42:37.623
One of these days.

695
00:42:37.624 --> 00:42:39.558
Well, if they do,
I hope I'm mounted


696
00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:42.294
On my Allis Chalmers
tractor plowin',


697
00:42:42.295 --> 00:42:45.397
'cause that's what I'm gonna
be doin' from here on out.


698
00:42:45.398 --> 00:42:49.100
If you're a farmer, garland,
I'm a brain surgeon.


699
00:42:50.169 --> 00:42:51.837
Hey, have a good trip.

700
00:42:51.838 --> 00:42:52.905
Ok.

701
00:42:52.906 --> 00:42:54.172
Gonna miss goin'
with you.


702
00:42:54.173 --> 00:42:55.841
All right.
See you later.


703
00:42:55.842 --> 00:42:57.008
Um...

704
00:42:57.009 --> 00:42:58.510
Got a good day for
travelin', honey.


705
00:42:58.511 --> 00:42:59.745
Yeah.
Yeah.


706
00:42:59.746 --> 00:43:01.914
Hey, we'll take some time off
after labor day, ok?


707
00:43:01.915 --> 00:43:03.449
We will?
Sure.


708
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.400
Promise?
Yeah.


709
00:43:05.401 --> 00:43:06.318
Ok.

710
00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:08.587
Call me as soon
as you get in, huh?


711
00:43:08.588 --> 00:43:09.854
As soon
as we get checked in.


712
00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:10.855
Ok.

713
00:43:10.856 --> 00:43:11.790
Let's go.

714
00:43:16.663 --> 00:43:18.062
Child: Bye, Lily!

715
00:43:18.063 --> 00:43:20.315
Children: Bye, Lily!

716
00:43:20.316 --> 00:43:22.434
Bye-bye.
I love you.


717
00:43:22.435 --> 00:43:24.702
Bye. Bye-bye.

718
00:43:30.843 --> 00:43:32.477
Buck: %% on the road again %%

719
00:43:33.879 --> 00:43:36.981
%% just can't wait
to get on the road again %%


720
00:43:38.368 --> 00:43:42.070
%% the life I love is

00:43:42.071 --> 00:43:44.839

00:44:02.658 --> 00:44:07.679
%% like a band of gypsies,

728
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.331
That a new hat
you got there, Sid?


729
00:44:09.332 --> 00:44:10.865
Yeah. You like it?

730
00:44:10.866 --> 00:44:12.150
Yeah. It looks
like a good one.


731
00:44:12.151 --> 00:44:14.653
It is a beaut,
I guarantee you.


732
00:44:14.654 --> 00:44:19.158
It's amazing what they can do
with cow flop nowadays.


733
00:44:19.159 --> 00:44:21.944
Deal, asshole. I might
want to buy a new one.


734
00:44:21.945 --> 00:44:24.680
I'll bet you would.
I'll bet you would.


735
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:26.448
Who all in here has got
a college education?


736
00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:27.533
Lily: I do.

737
00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:28.883
You do?
Yeah.


738
00:44:28.884 --> 00:44:31.553
Well, run in the back there
and get me a beer, would you?


739
00:44:31.554 --> 00:44:34.289
Hate to see an education
go to waste.


740
00:44:35.625 --> 00:44:37.292
Sid:
I only got 4 cards.


741
00:44:37.293 --> 00:44:39.377
You're gettin'
another one right here.


742
00:44:39.378 --> 00:44:40.629
Could you
get me one, too?


743
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.497
Get me one, too, babe.

744
00:44:42.498 --> 00:44:45.300
Sid: Why don't you just
bring an armful, Lily?


745
00:44:51.224 --> 00:44:53.809
Here you go.
Here you go.


746
00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:55.126
Thank you.

747
00:44:55.127 --> 00:44:58.797
That college education comes
in real handy, don't it?


748
00:44:59.899 --> 00:45:01.299
Sid:
Are you gonna bet?


749
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.734
Bo: I'm gonna bet.

750
00:45:02.735 --> 00:45:04.119
The bet is to you.

751
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.120
To me?
To you.


752
00:45:05.121 --> 00:45:06.121
All right.

753
00:45:06.122 --> 00:45:07.155
Start the betting.

754
00:45:07.156 --> 00:45:08.490
Ah, well, ok.

755
00:45:08.491 --> 00:45:10.808
Oh. Y'all pass.

756
00:45:10.809 --> 00:45:12.294
I'm gonna
clean y'all out.


757
00:45:12.295 --> 00:45:14.029
That's absolutely
all there is to it.


758
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.130
Sid:
All right, I'm in.


759
00:45:15.131 --> 00:45:16.131
Your bet, Bo.

760
00:45:16.132 --> 00:45:17.366
My bet?
Your bet.


761
00:45:17.367 --> 00:45:19.384
All right.
Let me see here.


762
00:45:19.385 --> 00:45:21.169
Think about it now.
Take a good look.


763
00:45:22.555 --> 00:45:25.473
Well, I'm takin'
a great look.


764
00:45:25.474 --> 00:45:26.808
All right.

765
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:28.009
All right,
it's your bet, Bo.


766
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.277
I'm bettin' 10.

767
00:45:29.278 --> 00:45:30.329
That's all?

768
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.164
I'm bettin' $10.

769
00:45:32.165 --> 00:45:33.165
$10, huh?

770
00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:35.000
I'm gonna bet you 10.

771
00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:36.535
I'm gonna raise you 20.

772
00:45:36.536 --> 00:45:38.286
You're gonna raise me 20?

773
00:45:38.287 --> 00:45:39.688
You got it.

774
00:45:39.689 --> 00:45:41.656
Well, that's 30 to you.

775
00:45:41.657 --> 00:45:42.958
30 to me.
I tell you,


776
00:45:42.959 --> 00:45:45.426
That's 30 to you,
and then 30 to you again.


777
00:45:45.427 --> 00:45:47.295
Gonna be 60 to you, Sid.

778
00:45:47.296 --> 00:45:48.730
I'll put it in.

779
00:45:48.731 --> 00:45:50.482
Go ahead, Sid.
Your bet.


780
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:53.385
You're bettin'
out of turn.


781
00:45:53.386 --> 00:45:54.669
Don't worry about me
bettin' out of turn.


782
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:55.954
How'd that get on the bus?

783
00:45:58.674 --> 00:46:00.725
[coughs]

784
00:46:00.726 --> 00:46:02.210
It looks like
it's rooster's.


785
00:46:02.211 --> 00:46:03.444
I haven't worn a bra

786
00:46:03.445 --> 00:46:07.049
Since the last time
we were in Vegas.


787
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.867
It's yours--
bullshit!


788
00:46:08.868 --> 00:46:10.485
One of you's been messin'
around with my girlfriend,


789
00:46:10.486 --> 00:46:11.920
And I want to know
who it was,


790
00:46:11.921 --> 00:46:13.755
And I want to know
right now.


791
00:46:16.943 --> 00:46:17.759
I'm waitin'.

792
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.363
Oh, Tex, somebody
had to do it.


793
00:46:21.364 --> 00:46:23.114
I did, too.
I did, too.


794
00:46:23.115 --> 00:46:23.915
Tex!

795
00:46:23.916 --> 00:46:25.433
Yeah, me, too.

796
00:46:25.434 --> 00:46:27.502
We had to pry him off
with a crowbar.


797
00:46:27.503 --> 00:46:31.056
I haven't been pried off
with a crowbar since...


798
00:46:31.057 --> 00:46:33.058
The last time

You just butt out!

800
00:46:34.427 --> 00:46:35.576
Drive the bus!

801
00:46:37.496 --> 00:46:39.046
Here, you want it back?

802
00:46:39.047 --> 00:46:41.499
Buck: Thanks.

803
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.735
Pay no attention
to the guys.


804
00:46:43.736 --> 00:46:45.370
They're just a little
bit high-spirited


805
00:46:45.371 --> 00:46:46.938
After being back
on the road.


806
00:46:46.939 --> 00:46:48.573
Yeah, I don't blame them.

807
00:46:48.574 --> 00:46:53.077
It's like gettin' paid
to go to a party.


808
00:46:53.078 --> 00:46:55.313
You know, you're invited.

809
00:46:56.983 --> 00:47:00.034
Hell, they told me you were
a lot of fun on the road, buck.


810
00:47:00.035 --> 00:47:01.820
Oh, I'll get back there.

811
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.925
I guess it takes
a few Miles, huh,


812
00:47:06.926 --> 00:47:09.427
To get back into it...

813
00:47:09.428 --> 00:47:13.431
Get over feelin' sad about
leaving people behind.


814
00:47:13.432 --> 00:47:14.599
How old you say
you were?


815
00:47:16.385 --> 00:47:18.102
Don't hold it
against garland,


816
00:47:18.103 --> 00:47:20.388
Him being gone
all the time.


817
00:47:20.389 --> 00:47:22.073
I don't.

818
00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:23.792
I wanted everything.
I wanted him home,


819
00:47:23.793 --> 00:47:26.928
And I wanted to be
garland Ramsey's daughter, too.


820
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:32.066
And I don't believe
I'm on this bus.

00:47:44.897 --> 00:47:45.997
Oh, something fierce.

827
00:47:45.998 --> 00:47:47.666
Just throw it out there

828
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:49.434
And see what they
throw back, ok?


829
00:47:49.435 --> 00:47:50.736

Mm-hmm.

About 1,200 times.

I bet he gave that to you.

I guess I'm leaving.

Volcanoes.

Yeah, maybe some
wine or something.

You gonna let me
stay all night?

No, never could.

to it, though.

He quit his band

if we cancel him out.

1280
01:13:01.495 --> 01:13:02.511
Well, I'll tell you,

1281
01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:03.746
He wanted to get cleaned up

1282
01:13:03.747 --> 01:13:05.647
Before he shook hands
with his idol.


1283
01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:06.982
Now, listen,

1284
01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:09.969
I did have a Chance
to talk to your wife


1285
01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:11.471
About pay and all,

1286
01:13:11.472 --> 01:13:14.924
But, uh, well, we never did
get a Chance to talk fringe.


1287
01:13:14.925 --> 01:13:18.144
Uh, what's fringe?

1288
01:13:18.145 --> 01:13:20.313
Well, I'm talking
about percent.


1289
01:13:20.314 --> 01:13:21.097
Of what?

1290
01:13:21.098 --> 01:13:23.099
Well, gate,

1291
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.934
Uh, records...

1292
01:13:24.935 --> 01:13:26.435
Uh, t-shirts.

1293
01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:27.937
Whatever you got.

1294
01:13:27.938 --> 01:13:30.439
See, I got me
a new merchandising outfit.


1295
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.909
Oh, goddamn! I come up
a flash last night.


1296
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:35.377
Why don't we buy us a carload
of Texas straw hats


1297
01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:38.197
From Hong Kong, China,
or someplace?


1298
01:13:38.198 --> 01:13:41.200
Now, look, straw wouldn't
be but about 85 cents.


1299
01:13:41.201 --> 01:13:42.685
To them damn chinks.

1300
01:13:42.686 --> 01:13:44.420
We either put a picture
of you and Cotton,


1301
01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:46.873
Or we put a crest
on them, see,


1302
01:13:46.874 --> 01:13:48.625
But we have some of them
made up in paper.


1303
01:13:48.626 --> 01:13:50.326
So, buck, let me get
a close-up of you.


1304
01:13:50.327 --> 01:13:51.511
Look over here.

1305
01:13:51.512 --> 01:13:53.079
Confederate flags.

1306
01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.998
Confederate flags
work the same way


1307
01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:57.300
The hats do.

1308
01:13:57.301 --> 01:13:59.101
Everybody that sees one
is gonna want one.


1309
01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.720
Plus, it reminds them
to go to the concert.


1310
01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:02.421
Now, they get
to the concert,


1311
01:14:02.422 --> 01:14:04.423
And we're gonna have
the cloth version on a stick,


1312
01:14:04.424 --> 01:14:07.260
And we're gonna charge
$5.00 a damn shot for it.


1313
01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:09.244
Ain't gonna cost us
anything


1314
01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.863
But cloth and dye
and a stick.


1315
01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:12.848
And we're gonna make us
a fortune,


1316
01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:15.518
And I'll guaran-damn-tee it.
Yes, sir.


1317
01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:18.071
Hey, Cotton,
come on over here, boy!


1318
01:14:18.072 --> 01:14:20.873
Listen. Look here.
I want you to meet buck.


1319
01:14:20.874 --> 01:14:23.876
How you doing, buck?
Nice to see you.


1320
01:14:23.877 --> 01:14:25.544
Brag: And this
is his manager Sid.


1321
01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:27.045
Hi, Sid.
How are you?


1322
01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:28.831
That's quite a suit.

1323
01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:30.133
Yes, sir,
it's quite a suit.


1324
01:14:30.134 --> 01:14:33.002
Cost us a fortune,
I'll guaran-damn-tee it.


1325
01:14:33.003 --> 01:14:34.269
Wear that
on stage?


1326
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.971
Yeah.

1327
01:14:34.972 --> 01:14:36.889
Hell, yes,
he wears them on stage!


1328
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:39.025
See, the lights
hit them shiny things,


1329
01:14:39.026 --> 01:14:40.526
And I'll tell you,

1330
01:14:40.527 --> 01:14:42.528
It damn near blinds them
for 10 rows back.


1331
01:14:42.529 --> 01:14:45.682
Come on over here, son.
Have yourself a drink.


1332
01:14:45.683 --> 01:14:48.518
I got something
that'll knock your eye out.


1333
01:14:48.519 --> 01:14:50.853
Uh, dolly,
come on over here


1334
01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:53.222
And give this young man
a drink.


1335
01:14:54.458 --> 01:14:57.610
Open up, Lily. It's buck.
Give me 500 bucks.


1336
01:14:57.611 --> 01:14:58.778
Ok.

1337
01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.267
Hi.

1338
01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:08.337
I understand my replacement
has arrived.


1339
01:15:09.406 --> 01:15:11.407
Yeah.
Let's go for a walk.


1340
01:15:21.785 --> 01:15:23.035
Where's buck?

1341
01:15:23.036 --> 01:15:24.536
I don't know.

1342
01:15:24.537 --> 01:15:26.072
All right,
has anybody seen the--


1343
01:15:26.073 --> 01:15:28.074
There's nobody in here.
I'm talking to myself.


1344
01:15:28.075 --> 01:15:29.175
We're late!

1345
01:15:30.243 --> 01:15:32.578
Ohh. Where you been?
You ready to go on?


1346
01:15:32.579 --> 01:15:33.879
How you feeling?

1347
01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.365
Hey, Cotton,

1348
01:15:35.366 --> 01:15:37.299
Why don't you go out there
and warm them up a little?


1349
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.985
Do anything you wanna do.
Some of your own stuff.


1350
01:15:38.986 --> 01:15:39.786
What?

1351
01:15:39.787 --> 01:15:41.220
Just leave
the curtain shut


1352
01:15:41.221 --> 01:15:43.055
And go and pick a couple
of songs for them.


1353
01:15:43.056 --> 01:15:44.574
You can handle that,
can't you?


1354
01:15:44.575 --> 01:15:45.541
Are you kidding?

1355
01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:47.042
Hell, he'll have them
rolling in the aisles


1356
01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.310
On the second song.

1357
01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:49.746
On the first song.

1358
01:15:49.747 --> 01:15:51.163
First song!
That's right.


1359
01:15:51.164 --> 01:15:53.132
<i>What are you gonna open
with, king of the road?</i>


1360
01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.684
No. A tune
that I wrote.


1361
01:15:54.685 --> 01:15:56.002
Oh, all right,
all right.


1362

I appreciate it so much.

Listen, would you do me
a big favor


1372

And give a big round
of applause

[man coughs]

1596
01:29:57.010 --> 01:29:59.043
Hey, I'm sorry about
tonight, everybody.


1597
01:29:59.044 --> 01:30:01.179
I guess we won't be
too welcome


1598
01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.681
Back at garland's
picnic.

[car horn honking]

1600
01:30:06.869 --> 01:30:09.121
Sid, what do you think about
extending a little bit,


1601
01:30:09.122 --> 01:30:11.122
Adding a few days
onto the tour?


1602
01:30:13.459 --> 01:30:14.692
Might be a good time

1603
01:30:14.693 --> 01:30:17.062
To see how we go over
back east.


1604
01:30:17.063 --> 01:30:20.031
I might try the far east
if I were you.


1605
01:30:28.174 --> 01:30:30.125
Lily: I'm so embarrassed
I can't think.


1606
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:34.162
Didn't you think
something like this


1607
01:30:34.163 --> 01:30:35.931
Was bound to happen?

1608
01:30:35.932 --> 01:30:37.649
[raining outside]

1609
01:30:39.985 --> 01:30:41.119
All I--

1610
01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.424
All I knew was
bound to happen was...


1611
01:30:45.425 --> 01:30:50.028
You'd look at me on
the stage one night...


1612
01:30:50.029 --> 01:30:51.463
You'd smile...

1613
01:30:53.499 --> 01:30:57.436
And I'd sing for you
like an Angel.


1614
01:30:59.339 --> 01:31:01.540
You'd fall in love
with me.


1615
01:31:03.493 --> 01:31:05.360
I never got past that.

01:31:12.502 --> 01:31:13.768
So...

1618
01:31:13.769 --> 01:31:17.188
What do we do now? Just
keep touring or what?


1619
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:19.341
I think I'll slide down
to Mexico for a few days


1620
01:31:19.342 --> 01:31:23.044
And give Sid a Chance
to rearrange the schedule.


1621
01:31:23.045 --> 01:31:24.212
It'd be nice to go
somewhere,


1622
01:31:24.213 --> 01:31:26.013
Just the two of us.

1623
01:31:35.924 --> 01:31:37.692
You're not taking me,
are you?


1624
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:44.566
I need to be by myself
for a while.


1625
01:31:47.453 --> 01:31:49.036
Hey, Sid.

1626
01:31:49.037 --> 01:31:50.538
Morning, buck.

1628
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:52.574
Sure.

1629
01:31:56.228 --> 01:31:57.261
Thanks.

1630
01:32:02.635 --> 01:32:04.569
You talk to
any promoters yet?


1631
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:06.938
Thought we might line up
a few college dates.


1632
01:32:10.826 --> 01:32:12.811
Are you ok, buck?

1633
01:32:16.148 --> 01:32:17.648
She should not
have done that, Sid.


1634
01:32:17.649 --> 01:32:19.150
She shouldn't have
done it.


1635
01:32:19.151 --> 01:32:20.352
It was not right.

1636
01:32:20.353 --> 01:32:22.671
Well, I think she must
love you very much


1637
01:32:22.672 --> 01:32:24.239
To do what she did.

1638
01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.008
She's got a funny way
of showing it.


1639
01:32:27.009 --> 01:32:29.010
Did you really give her
any choice?


1640
01:32:31.613 --> 01:32:32.880
Hey, I feel bad for you.

1641
01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:35.350
I told you I'd manage
to screw things up.


1642
01:32:42.041 --> 01:32:43.208
What are they doing
out there?


1643
01:32:44.861 --> 01:32:46.678
Uh, they're unpacking
the bus, buck.


1644
01:32:46.679 --> 01:32:47.896
We all talked last night,

1645
01:32:47.897 --> 01:32:50.815
And they want to go back
and play at garland's picnic.


1646
01:32:50.816 --> 01:32:52.601
I'm not going
back there.


1647
01:32:52.602 --> 01:32:54.686
Buck, we all tried
to figure out


1648
01:32:54.687 --> 01:32:57.188
A way to stand for you.

1649
01:32:57.189 --> 01:33:00.191
We all tried to figure how
to stay neutral in this,


1650
01:33:00.192 --> 01:33:03.094
And you put everybody
in the middle.


1651
01:33:13.138 --> 01:33:15.222
Where you guys going?

1652
01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:17.525
We got to go back,
buck.


1653
01:33:17.526 --> 01:33:19.944
We can't
let garland down.


1654
01:33:19.945 --> 01:33:23.732
No more than he's been
let down already.


1655
01:33:35.778 --> 01:33:37.745
Well, buy 'em all
plane tickets, Sid.


1656
01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.762
The band's going back to
play garland's picnic.


1657
01:34:15.785 --> 01:34:17.052
You want some breakfast?

1658
01:34:19.705 --> 01:34:21.406
No, I don't want anything.

What's the matter?

1661
01:34:28.865 --> 01:34:34.202
I've been thinking about
what you said last night...


1662
01:34:34.203 --> 01:34:36.637
How sometimes...
Loving somebody


1663
01:34:36.638 --> 01:34:39.074
Can cause so much misery.

1664
01:34:43.579 --> 01:34:45.880
And it's a hard one
to get around.

I can't
get around it, buck.


1667
01:34:55.191 --> 01:34:57.458
Now, what's that mean?

1668
01:34:58.411 --> 01:35:00.578
It means, if it hurts
this many people,


1669
01:35:00.579 --> 01:35:02.948
It's got to be wrong.

1670
01:35:04.583 --> 01:35:06.651
I got to go
back home, buck.

I can get some tequila.

I believe you and me
need to have a little talk.

I don't want to talk.

I figured maybe
you'd feel that way.

That's the reason
I brought this.

Aw, bullshit, garland...

1719

Remember that Mexican
I damn near killed

In the cantina
that night?

Mm-hmm.

1722
01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:19.336
I'd only drank
a half a bottle...

01:39:19.337 --> 01:39:21.739
And that was
on a full stomach.

You ain't gonna
use that on me.

Let go of my arm!

1755
01:40:43.105 --> 01:40:44.322
You broke my heart, boy.

1756
01:40:44.323 --> 01:40:46.240
Give me the gun. Ow!

1757
01:40:46.241 --> 01:40:48.042
Oh, Jesus.

1758
01:40:48.043 --> 01:40:49.294
Oh.

1759
01:40:49.295 --> 01:40:50.427
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1760
01:40:56.735 --> 01:41:00.221
Lookie there.
You ruined my goddamn shirt.


1761
01:41:00.222 --> 01:41:01.305
Hell, I nearly
killed you.


1762
01:41:01.306 --> 01:41:03.173
You damn near did.

Hey, it ain't funny.
It ain't.

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:09.380
Yeah, it is.

1767
01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:15.102
Oh, Christ.
I need a drink.


1768
01:41:15.103 --> 01:41:16.537
Me, too.

1769
01:41:17.906 --> 01:41:20.674
Let's go over
to the cantina.


1770
01:41:20.675 --> 01:41:23.110
We'll get us a drink.

1771

Are you ok?

I'm getting too old

How's Viv?

1779
01:41:53.492 --> 01:41:55.226
Mom, Lily's here!

1780
01:42:08.023 --> 01:42:09.523
I don't think we have

1781
01:42:09.524 --> 01:42:11.092
Anything to say
to each other, Lily.


1782
01:42:13.612 --> 01:42:14.895
Please let me talk.

1783
01:42:18.133 --> 01:42:19.666
Go ahead.

1784
01:42:23.305 --> 01:42:24.222
Um...

1785
01:42:25.441 --> 01:42:27.108
This is real hard...

1786
01:42:29.962 --> 01:42:32.947
But I just come
to apologize.


1787
01:42:39.304 --> 01:42:40.737
Thank you.

1788
01:42:43.192 --> 01:42:44.192
Yeah.

1789
01:42:59.508 --> 01:43:01.676
You love him,
don't you?


1790
01:43:01.677 --> 01:43:04.111
Jamie, you live
with somebody for 15 years,


1791
01:43:04.112 --> 01:43:06.080
You know, you just don't
stop loving them


1792
01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:07.298
Just like that.

1793
01:43:07.299 --> 01:43:10.268
Does that mean
you do love him?


1794
01:43:14.172 --> 01:43:16.940
It means I'm trying
to understand it all.


1795
01:43:18.877 --> 01:43:21.211
It's not enough
to love somebody.


1796
01:43:22.781 --> 01:43:24.848
They have
to love you back.


1797
01:43:27.185 --> 01:43:30.454
I don't understand it all,
but I still love him.

You better let me drive.

You almost hit
that son of a bitch.


1804
01:43:46.672 --> 01:43:48.572
I missed him.

1805
01:43:48.573 --> 01:43:50.507
I know you
when you're drunk,


1806
01:43:50.508 --> 01:43:53.744
And I know you
when you're sober,


1807
01:43:53.745 --> 01:43:55.146
And you're
sure as hell drunk.


1808
01:43:55.147 --> 01:43:56.897
Now, goddamn it,
let me drive.


1809
01:43:56.898 --> 01:43:58.615
Ok, then drive
this son of a...

Hey! Goddamn it!

1811

Hey, wait a minute!

1812

Goddamn! Jesus Christ! Get
the hell out of the damn way!

Shoot.

garland!

Goddamn it,
I wish you wouldn't


1816
01:44:13.115 --> 01:44:15.583
Pull that kind of shit,
buck.


1817
01:44:15.584 --> 01:44:17.168
Which way are we
going, anyway?


1818
01:44:18.553 --> 01:44:20.721
Well, that last sign
you mowed over


1819
01:44:20.722 --> 01:44:22.623
Said "Texas."

1820
01:44:22.624 --> 01:44:23.708
Texas? I don't want
to go to Texas.


1821
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:27.177
Turn this son of a bitch
around.


1822
01:44:27.178 --> 01:44:29.430
Garland: All right.

1823
01:44:29.431 --> 01:44:31.215
Uhh!

1824
01:44:31.216 --> 01:44:32.884
You silly old fart!

1825
01:44:32.885 --> 01:44:33.718
That's the way to turn

around, garland.

to put rubber gears

01:44:42.444 --> 01:44:44.562
In that son of a bitch
next year.


1832
01:44:44.563 --> 01:44:47.148
Shit! I never drove
for 30 years for nothing.

01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:48.866
[gears grind]

1834
01:44:50.068 --> 01:44:52.052
I can't go back
to Texas anyway.


1835
01:44:52.053 --> 01:44:53.070
No?

1836
01:44:54.105 --> 01:44:55.689
Believe it'd be
kind of hard.


1837
01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:56.924
Yeah, at least out here,

1838
01:44:56.925 --> 01:44:59.043
Ain't nobody trying to nail
my feet to the floor.


1839
01:44:59.044 --> 01:45:01.678
Yeah. The whole road's
open to you now.


1840
01:45:01.679 --> 01:45:02.980
Yeah.

1841
01:45:04.949 --> 01:45:06.417
I'll just take
them old songs out there


1842
01:45:06.418 --> 01:45:09.170
And sing them to a whole
bunch of new people, garland.


1843
01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:10.204
You know, it's too bad

1844
01:45:10.205 --> 01:45:13.491
You can't come up
with some new songs


1845
01:45:13.492 --> 01:45:15.876
To sing to them
old friends of yours.


1846
01:45:19.481 --> 01:45:21.148
You miss the road much?

1847
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:23.851
Well, now,
I'll tell you--


1848
01:45:23.852 --> 01:45:25.669
I've planted

1849
01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:28.572
80 acres of oats.

1850
01:45:28.573 --> 01:45:30.307
Every morning,
I go out there,


1851
01:45:30.308 --> 01:45:33.627
And I look
for them bugs.


1852
01:45:33.628 --> 01:45:37.180
Do you know there's
more goddamn varieties


1853
01:45:37.181 --> 01:45:40.734
Of them little bastards
planning on eating my grain

01:45:40.735 --> 01:45:43.470
Than you can shake
a goddamn stick at?


1855
01:45:43.471 --> 01:45:46.523
But goddamn,
I have a hard time


1856
01:45:46.524 --> 01:45:48.642
Having any animosity

1857
01:45:48.643 --> 01:45:51.145
Against them
dirty little shit-asses.


1858
01:45:51.146 --> 01:45:52.596
You miss it that much, huh?

1859
01:45:53.598 --> 01:45:57.518
Well, after 30 years
on the road...


1860
01:45:57.519 --> 01:45:59.453
You're goddamn right
I miss it.


1861
01:45:59.454 --> 01:46:02.239
At least you got a good old
lady at home that loves you.


1862
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.874
We love each other

1863
01:46:03.875 --> 01:46:06.010
More than we ever did now.

1864
01:46:10.965 --> 01:46:13.350
You still love her, buck?

1865
01:46:16.788 --> 01:46:18.488
Yeah, I still love her.

1866
01:46:20.776 --> 01:46:24.227
I hadn't planned on losing
my whole family, garland.

Never seen you lose nothin'
you didn't want to.

around.

Hang on, damn it.

I'm going to kick this
son of a bitch in the ass,

And we're going home!
