1
00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:20.629
It was clear.
Only one of us would survive.


2
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.213
And at the end it was me.

3
00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:25.750
Not him.

4
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.924
Please, can you help me!
I've been kidnapped.


5
00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:09.501
My name is Natascha Kampusch.

6
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.282
3096 Days.

7
00:02:44.703 --> 00:02:46.622
This is my daughter.

8
00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:50.165
Okay, Everyone.

9
00:02:51.078 --> 00:02:53.932
We're not going to be this young again!

10
00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:56.084
Cheers!

11
00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:58.084
I love you.

12
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.795
Dad, we have to go, you promised
mommy you take me back by eight.


13
00:03:13.953 --> 00:03:16.047
We'll go in a minute, my darling.

14
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.205
And then the man says:
…I've already got her!


15
00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:27.250
Natascha!

16
00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:36.377
Natascha, it's time to get up!

17
00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:39.376
I'm not telling you again.

18
00:03:42.537 --> 00:03:46.121
I put the dress out for you.
Do I have to wear it?


19
00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:48.506
Have you got any idea how
long I've worked on that?


20
00:03:48.703 --> 00:03:52.833
Other girl would be happy if their
mothers made them such nice dresses.


21
00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:57.831
It's nice, but it makes me look fat.
Then don't eat so many biscuits.


22
00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:11.664
What's taking you so long?

23
00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:15.797
I've got to go to work!

24
00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:39.668
He took to that bar again?

25
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.347
A child has no business in a bar.

26
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.480
If he brings you home late once more
It'll be the last time you go to see him.


27
00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:53.170
Stop it! Leave me alone,
we weren't in the bar.


28
00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:01.585
Pumpkin, I'm sorry!

29
00:05:02.828 --> 00:05:04.126
Don't be like that...

30
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.417
Help!

31
00:09:28.453 --> 00:09:30.000
Hello?

32
00:09:30.578 --> 00:09:32.125
Hello!

33
00:09:32.787 --> 00:09:34.334
Is there anybody there?

34
00:10:44.495 --> 00:10:46.042
Get up!

35
00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:51.500
Stand back.

36
00:11:03.787 --> 00:11:05.334
Take off your shoes.

37
00:11:30.203 --> 00:11:32.001
I want to go to my mommy...

38
00:11:58.328 --> 00:11:59.875
Help!

39
00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:01.959
Help!

40
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.167
Help!

41
00:12:17.578 --> 00:12:19.125
Help!

42
00:13:03.037 --> 00:13:04.584
Mommy...

43
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.167
Mommy?

44
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.167
Day 3.

45
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.345
And the prince...

46
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.625
the prince wanted to marry a princess.

47
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.744
But she had to be a real princess.

48
00:14:03.453 --> 00:14:05.133
And the prince wanted to marry a princess.

49
00:14:05.353 --> 00:14:09.290
But she had to be a real princess.

50
00:14:12.287 --> 00:14:15.131
One evening there was a
knock on the palace gates.


51
00:14:17.953 --> 00:14:19.500
Go ahead, have one.

52
00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:37.929
The aged Queen thought to herself,
we will put that to the test...


53
00:14:38.028 --> 00:14:41.503
and place a pea at
the bottom of the bed.

54
00:14:42.703 --> 00:14:45.832
And she stacked twenty
mattresses on top of the pea


55
00:14:45.995 --> 00:14:48.714
and then twenty blankets on top of them.

56
00:14:50.162 --> 00:14:54.338
The next morning the princess
was asked how she had slept.


57
00:14:54.578 --> 00:14:56.706
And she cried out: It was awful.

58
00:14:57.953 --> 00:15:03.380
I was lying on something hard,
and now I'm black and Blue all over.


59
00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:08.746
The prince then took her as his wife,

60
00:15:08.953 --> 00:15:11.672
because now he knew he
had found his princess.


61
00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:16.292
So.

62
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.667
The End.

63
00:15:34.745 --> 00:15:36.292
Thank you...

64
00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:45.048
Are you going?
Are you going far away?


65
00:15:48.287 --> 00:15:49.834
Wait!

66
00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:53.631
Will you give me a kiss goodnight?

67
00:15:57.203 --> 00:16:00.582
My Mom always gives me
a goodnight kiss...


68
00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:36.487
10 year old Natascha is still
missing, for the past week


69
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.252
several hundred police officers
have been scarring the area


70
00:16:39.412 --> 00:16:41.653
since she vanished the
morning of the 2nd of March.


71
00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:43.918
Despite their tireless efforts

72
00:16:44.078 --> 00:16:46.421
search teams have still failed
to find any trace of her.


73
00:16:46.434 --> 00:16:48.788
Natascha's mother has
been quoted as saying,


74
00:16:48.953 --> 00:16:52.958
I have lost all hope.
How could you say that?


75
00:16:53.162 --> 00:16:57.121
I didn't, Mother.
They write whatever they want.


76
00:16:57.537 --> 00:16:59.903
The police diving unit
has also been used to


77
00:16:59.916 --> 00:17:02.293
search several lakes
in the immediate area.


78
00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:06.079
Thank God Natascha wasn't down there.

79
00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:10.754
So far Natascha remains missing
without a trace... and now to sports...


80
00:17:12.912 --> 00:17:16.792
"“Stop it, leave me alone...
Help! Help!"


81
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.540
One, two...

82
00:17:19.703 --> 00:17:21.626
Pumpkin, I'm sorry!
Don't be like that...


83
00:17:22.078 --> 00:17:23.625
Five, six.

84
00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:35.907
One, two, three, four…

85
00:17:43.412 --> 00:17:48.714
One, two, three, four.

86
00:17:51.412 --> 00:17:53.506
One, two, three.

87
00:17:54.203 --> 00:17:57.833
“I have to count the days.”
Four, five, six.


88
00:17:58.687 --> 00:18:01.961
One, two, three... what time is it?

89
00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:11.161
This should do you for next week.

90
00:18:11.662 --> 00:18:15.417
Beef casserole and red cabbage.

91
00:18:17.578 --> 00:18:19.672
Mashed peas and carrots.

92
00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:21.800
You can have in one day,
and one in the next.


93
00:18:21.813 --> 00:18:23.712
That should keep you
going till Wednesday.


94
00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:25.542
All right.

95
00:18:27.662 --> 00:18:29.255
And potato salad.

96
00:18:30.078 --> 00:18:33.002
But with no mayonnaise
so you can warm it through.


97
00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.150
Well I could even have
it with the red cabbage.


98
00:18:35.163 --> 00:18:37.079
Like a vegetarian.

99
00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:38.875
A vegetarian?

100
00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:45.464
So... your favorite cold meat salad.

101
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.999
And lots of turnips and onions,
as you've always liked it.


102
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.796
But you have to eat it soon. Well let's
eat it now mother. The two of us.


103
00:18:57.495 --> 00:19:00.544
What have you done now?
What makes you say that?


104
00:19:09.662 --> 00:19:14.088
Fears are growing that Natascha
has been abducted.


105
00:19:14.245 --> 00:19:19.051
Her kidnapper was probably hiding waiting
her to get to school shown here on the map.


106
00:19:19.453 --> 00:19:21.994
Much of the information given by the...

107
00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:25.834
So that pervert is sexually
abusing that child.


108
00:19:27.162 --> 00:19:29.892
Why else would he ever abduct her?

109
00:19:31.495 --> 00:19:34.669
Who knows?
Maybe he's crazy mother.


110
00:19:42.037 --> 00:19:45.587
I wrote my parents so they don't worry.

111
00:19:45.787 --> 00:19:47.789
Can you send it to them?

112
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.417
<i>Take off your t-shirt.</i>

113
00:20:15.568 --> 00:20:16.068
Shampoo.

114
00:20:16.668 --> 00:20:20.664
Not too much!
You have any idea how this stuff costs?


115
00:20:22.912 --> 00:20:25.916
Good for nothing.
Then let me go.


116
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.448
Oh, nobody wants you.
My parents do want me.


117
00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:32.082
Really?
Then why aren't they paying the ransom?


118
00:20:33.537 --> 00:20:36.165
They don't care about you.
That's not true!


119
00:20:36.328 --> 00:20:39.332
Really, well don't believe it then.
But nobody is paying anything for you.


120
00:20:39.537 --> 00:20:42.068
They don't have money, why
didn't you pick a rich family?


121
00:20:42.137 --> 00:20:44.668
Well your parents just
have to go to the bank?


122
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:46.058
That's all they have to do!

123
00:20:46.128 --> 00:20:48.958
Every bank shows up money for kidnappings!

124
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.704
They don't care about you!
Because you're not worth it to them!


125
00:20:52.912 --> 00:20:56.166
That's not true!
Yes, it is. Is true!


126
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.090
Come here!
Let's clean that hair.


127
00:21:00.645 --> 00:21:02.247
Don't cry.

128
00:21:02.662 --> 00:21:06.917
I said stop crying!
Would you stop?


129
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.339
Look at me.
Stop crying!


130
00:21:10.662 --> 00:21:12.209
Stop crying!

131
00:21:16.245 --> 00:21:19.089
I can't stand whining!
Stop it.


132
00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.372
Shut up! Shut up!

133
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.043
I can't stand tears!

134
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.917
Shut up! Shut up!

135
00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:28.755
Stop it!

136
00:21:32.912 --> 00:21:34.914
The mess you made.

137
00:21:36.953 --> 00:21:39.172
Look at me. Look at me!

138
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.089
You're gonna clean it all up.

139
00:24:13.962 --> 00:24:15.037
Grandma...

140
00:24:15.062 --> 00:24:21.544
Let's more coffee?
Well. I've had enough.


141
00:24:21.703 --> 00:24:23.501
Mama?
Please.


142
00:24:29.787 --> 00:24:30.421
Sorry.

143
00:24:31.087 --> 00:24:33.821
You don't know why you
still can't get a job.


144
00:24:33.912 --> 00:24:37.246
<i>- What?
- I said, he still can't get a job!</i>


145
00:24:37.453 --> 00:24:38.400
Mother...

146
00:24:50.328 --> 00:24:53.172
Sorry.
I was in the back garden.


147
00:24:54.287 --> 00:24:56.164
<i>- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.</i>


148
00:24:56.453 --> 00:25:00.128
Are you the owner of this van?
Yep, what is it?


149
00:25:00.287 --> 00:25:02.915
Can we have a look at it?
Yes...


150
00:25:03.245 --> 00:25:06.795
What's this all about?
Would you mind open it, please Sir?


151
00:25:06.912 --> 00:25:09.984
Oh I heard you were
looking for a white van?


152
00:25:09.997 --> 00:25:13.079
Is it about that girl?

153
00:25:13.203 --> 00:25:14.843
Natascha Kampusch?, 
Wasn't that her name?

154
00:25:15.203 --> 00:25:16.673
Do you know anything about it?

155
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:21.046
I just heard the TV you were looking for
a white van with tinted windows.


156
00:25:21.203 --> 00:25:23.421
So, I thought someone
might come by. You


157
00:25:23.434 --> 00:25:25.663
wouldn't believe the
number we've looked at.


158
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.079
I can imagine, yes.
Why do you keep all your blinds down?


159
00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:33.329
Is a habit.
So, can you open it, please?


160
00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:35.418

00:26:04.887 --> 00:26:05.946
So live here then.

168
00:26:07.962 --> 00:26:09.621
I've got to ask you this.

Where were you on the 2nd of March?

171
00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:23.462
On 2nd of March...
Oh yes, I was here. I was at home.


172
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:28.376
Can anyone provide you with an alibi?
No, I was alone.


173
00:26:30.037 --> 00:26:32.586
So you live on your own then?
Yes.


174
00:26:33.703 --> 00:26:36.297
My mother and grandmother
just visit me. Would


175
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.914
you like some coffee?,
we have some cake?


176
00:26:39.078 --> 00:26:41.831
Thanks, no. We got to be going.
But...


177

<i>- Bye.

178
00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:47.365
What do you think?

179
00:27:47.887 --> 00:27:49.334
It's all right

180
00:27:50.787 --> 00:27:51.734
I love you...

181
00:27:51.887 --> 00:27:56.134
Good Night Natascha...

Good morning.

183
00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:18.875
Is it morning?

184
00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:26.956
How long am I
gonna have to stay here?

185
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.918
Until your parents pay.

186
00:28:31.453 --> 00:28:33.547
Can I have a clock? Please?

187
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.167
A clock?

188
00:28:42.203 --> 00:28:43.750
If you're good.

189
00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:47.292
Are you being good?

190
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:08.752
Did you send the letter to my parents?

191
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.917
Yes.

192
00:29:18.412 --> 00:29:19.959
Stop looking.

193
00:29:25.953 --> 00:29:27.500
What's that for?

194
00:29:29.328 --> 00:29:32.912
So I can hear you upstairs.
And talk to you.


195
00:29:38.328 --> 00:29:40.251
Are you alone up there too?

Good morning.
Hello.

The Aar river, it has its

<i>- How long is the Aar?

205
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.045

206
00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:05.542
That is correct.

207
00:31:07.287 --> 00:31:10.496

210
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:12.671
Miss Kampusch, how did you managed
to escape your kidnapper?


211
00:32:14.078 --> 00:32:16.627
In the end I overpowered him.

212
00:32:16.787 --> 00:32:21.418
How did you do that?
He was much bigger than you, wasn't he?


213
00:32:22.203 --> 00:32:23.830
Yes, he...

214
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.714
I just overpowered him.

215
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.706
Did you brush your teeth before or
after you overpowered him?


216
00:32:31.912 --> 00:32:34.888
What was that? Answer me!

217
00:32:34.913 --> 00:32:37.117
Nothing. You scared me...

218
00:32:38.078 --> 00:32:40.627
Did you brush your teeth?
Yes.


219
00:32:41.828 --> 00:32:44.172
Did you rinse off your plate?

220
00:32:46.703 --> 00:32:48.671
Yes.
You have to obey me.


221

It really hurts! Is so bad, you
have to take me to a doctor...


232

It's really bad!

233
00:33:52.995 --> 00:33:56.750
If you're gonna play with your food
You don't need any.


234
00:33:57.162 --> 00:33:58.906
You're too fat anyway.

235
00:33:59.469 --> 00:34:00.106
HELP!

239
00:34:06.455 --> 00:34:09.001
They'll have to put
sniffer dogs on the roof!


240
00:34:09.203 --> 00:34:12.537
Come here, come here,

247
00:35:19.912 --> 00:35:21.585

There isn't any upstairs.

320
00:42:34.328 --> 00:42:38.538
Don't move until I call you.
And don't get any ideas either.


321
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.839
I hold the doors and
windows secured with


322
00:42:41.852 --> 00:42:44.581
explosives, So if you
touch the wrong thing...


323
00:42:45.495 --> 00:42:48.089
Boom!
Do you understand?


324
00:43:06.787 --> 00:43:08.664
You can come up now.

325
00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:54.381
You just do what I tell you to.

326
00:43:55.453 --> 00:43:58.832
You'll go ahead of me.
If you scream...


327
00:44:00.287 --> 00:44:01.834
I'll kill you.

328
00:44:45.995 --> 00:44:47.918
What are you looking at?

329
00:45:06.662 --> 00:45:09.415
No!
You want to touch my towels?


330
00:45:10.328 --> 00:45:11.875
Wash it out!

331
00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:16.755
You keep getting more hair.

332
00:45:17.162 --> 00:45:20.962
<i>Locking me up downstairs is not gonna
stop me from growing up... - What was that?</i>


333
00:45:42.995 --> 00:45:46.750
Drink up.
Then I can put that in the dishwasher too.


334
00:45:50.662 --> 00:45:54.041
And don't turn it on until it's full?

335
00:45:57.203 --> 00:45:58.750
Okay.

336
00:46:12.828 --> 00:46:14.375
Right then.

337
00:46:15.995 --> 00:46:17.542
I'm off.

338
00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.579
Have you got a girlfriend?

339
00:46:27.662 --> 00:46:29.881
Where do you get that idea?

340
00:46:31.078 --> 00:46:32.751
Is she a blonde?

341
00:46:33.995 --> 00:46:35.542
No...

342
00:46:36.245 --> 00:46:38.293
No!
I'm glad.


343
00:46:39.037 --> 00:46:42.416
Grandmother was beginning to
worry that you were gay.


344
00:46:42.578 --> 00:46:44.125
Nonsense!

345
00:46:48.412 --> 00:46:50.085
I know, son.

346
00:47:35.203 --> 00:47:39.754
Wow, Christmas is upon us!
The year has flown by!


347
00:47:39.953 --> 00:47:42.428
The shops are still open
for another three hours!


348
00:47:42.453 --> 00:47:45.414
So go out and
grab those last few presents!

349
00:47:54.953 --> 00:47:58.414
Day 1837.

350
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.998
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.</i>


351
00:48:35.495 --> 00:48:37.497
Stop, that's for later,

352
00:48:39.453 --> 00:48:41.330
Look at this.

353
00:48:41.578 --> 00:48:43.125
Oh, wow.

354
00:48:43.995 --> 00:48:45.542
With screen.

355
00:48:47.412 --> 00:48:48.959
Nice, hah?

356
00:48:49.787 --> 00:48:51.334
Nice...

357
00:48:56.662 --> 00:48:58.209
Ah, ah, ah.

358
00:48:58.662 --> 00:49:00.209
Good. We'll see.

359
00:49:01.995 --> 00:49:06.455
What… ah, again.
Merry Christmas.


360
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.167
<i>- For me? - Yes.
- Thank you!</i>


361
00:49:09.287 --> 00:49:10.834
Stop!

362
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.417
Well, this...

363
00:49:15.703 --> 00:49:17.250
All right.

364
00:49:18.245 --> 00:49:19.792
Okay...

365
00:49:21.828 --> 00:49:24.547
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!

366
00:49:25.078 --> 00:49:26.625
Yes...

367
00:49:29.995 --> 00:49:33.370
Wow, a Walkman!

368
00:49:33.395 --> 00:49:35.581
Now I can listen
to music in the dark!

369
00:49:35.787 --> 00:49:38.070
<i>- Thank you!
- But you have to be good, 'cause...</i>


370
00:49:38.095 --> 00:49:40.184
<i>we don't want the batteries
to die so quickly this time.</i>


371
00:49:40.197 --> 00:49:42.296
<i>Of course, yeah. 
Thank you.</i>

372
00:49:43.828 --> 00:49:45.375
Keep going.

373
00:49:54.620 --> 00:50:00.002
Jungle Book,
Treasure Island, Karl May.


374
00:50:01.745 --> 00:50:03.292
Oh, wow...

375
00:50:05.162 --> 00:50:06.709
Go on, read it.

376
00:50:08.912 --> 00:50:14.373
The light of day is waning.
The hush of night is on its way.


377
00:50:16.453 --> 00:50:20.959
So for the hearts craving.
Can pass just like the day.


378
00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.460
This is so nice.

379
00:50:27.703 --> 00:50:29.250
Thank you...
Stop that!


380
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:43.001
This... it's Christmas...
And I cannot stop thinking about it...


381
00:50:44.953 --> 00:50:49.880
I really like to know how my family is.
You don't have a family anymore.


382
00:50:50.037 --> 00:50:52.904
Do you understand? Because
I 'em your family! I'm


383
00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:55.794
your father, I'm your mother,
I'm your grandmother!


384
00:50:55.953 --> 00:50:58.632
I'm everything to you!
Because I've created you.


385
00:50:58.645 --> 00:51:01.335
Your family is dead.

386
00:51:03.203 --> 00:51:04.750
They're all dead.

387
00:51:05.995 --> 00:51:07.542
But I'm here.

388
00:51:09.245 --> 00:51:15.252
You're not Natascha anymore.
We need a new name for you.


389
00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:18.963
An entirely new name.

390
00:51:23.412 --> 00:51:25.710
Look. Maria maybe.

391
00:51:27.787 --> 00:51:29.585
That's my grandmother's name?

392
00:51:31.495 --> 00:51:34.465
Yes, sure.
It's my middle name...


393
00:51:34.703 --> 00:51:37.062
Well that won't work then, because we
need an entirely new name for you,


394
00:51:37.087 --> 00:51:38.683
let's find something else.

395
00:51:40.078 --> 00:51:41.625
Look, Christa?

396
00:51:42.828 --> 00:51:44.375
Viviana?

397
00:51:46.037 --> 00:51:47.584
Viviana?

398
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.373
Well all right. 
Viviana, that's it.

399
00:51:51.745 --> 00:51:54.624
So, hold it...

400
00:51:56.745 --> 00:51:58.292
So as of today...

401
00:52:00.245 --> 00:52:02.464
As of today your name is...

402
00:52:05.245 --> 00:52:09.250
Viviana.
Let's say Vivi, that's better.


403
00:52:10.787 --> 00:52:12.789
As of today your name is...

404
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.749
My name is Viviana.
No, your name is Vivi.


405
00:52:18.495 --> 00:52:20.042
My name is Vivi.

406
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.043
And you can call me Wolfgang.

407
00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:30.964
Well you could thank me.

408
00:52:32.912 --> 00:52:34.835
Thank you, Wolfgang...

409
00:52:37.745 --> 00:52:39.338
Don't look at me.

410
00:52:45.912 --> 00:52:49.121
Look, what I knitted for her.

411
00:52:52.578 --> 00:52:56.162
You will need something warm
when she comes back.


412
00:52:59.245 --> 00:53:00.792
It should fit her.

413
00:53:04.703 --> 00:53:07.047
Do you think she still likes pink?

414
00:53:11.995 --> 00:53:15.044
I always took her to school...

415
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:17.417
in the car...

416
00:53:18.578 --> 00:53:20.125
every day.

417
00:53:22.787 --> 00:53:24.334
But that morning...

418
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.417
she just...

419
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:33.998
Why did it have to be her?

420
00:54:14.162 --> 00:54:15.835
Take off your vest.

421
00:54:20.078 --> 00:54:22.706
No need to wear it indoors.

422
00:54:30.453 --> 00:54:32.876
What do you need all this space for?

423
00:54:39.828 --> 00:54:41.830
Is your girlfriend moving in?

424
00:54:58.078 --> 00:54:59.796
Can I have a shower?

425
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:16.464
You can sleep upstairs tonight.

426
00:55:18.828 --> 00:55:20.375
With me.

427
00:55:48.787 --> 00:55:50.334
No.

428
00:57:22.662 --> 00:57:25.836
You got my sunscreen and lip balm?

429
00:57:26.162 --> 00:57:29.211
<i>- The energy bars are also there too.
- Good.</i>


430
00:57:31.828 --> 00:57:33.922
<i>- Do you have your gloves?
- Yes.</i>


431
00:57:42.703 --> 00:57:45.627
A propos...
Will you take me with you sometime?


432
00:57:50.037 --> 00:57:52.131
If you behave yourself, maybe.

433
00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.250
I do behave myself.

434
00:57:55.828 --> 00:57:57.375
Good.

435
00:58:06.578 --> 00:58:11.254
If you're good, we'd be out having a
great time, Just the two of us, yeah?


436
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.125
So a propos...
Have you heard the one about the skier?


437
00:58:17.662 --> 00:58:21.838
Just before the ski race begins,

438
00:58:22.828 --> 00:58:27.208
an avalanche comes crashing down
and all the skiers have been killed.


439
00:58:27.828 --> 00:58:29.375
So...

440
00:58:29.953 --> 00:58:31.500
Go on.

441
00:58:33.328 --> 00:58:35.961
So, the next morning...

442
00:58:36.428 --> 00:58:39.961
one of the widows,
comes to identify her dead husband.


443
00:58:40.203 --> 00:58:44.003
They open the first coffin,
and she shakes her head.


444
00:58:44.162 --> 00:58:47.712
Then they open the second coffin,
she shakes her head again.


445
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:52.706
Then they open the third coffin,
and she nods: That's him.


446
00:58:53.162 --> 00:58:56.541
Thank God, at least he came in third!

447
01:01:48.453 --> 01:01:50.547
No. The other one.

448
01:03:15.703 --> 01:03:17.626
I want to go out in the garden.

449
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:20.917
You want a what?

450
01:03:25.037 --> 01:03:27.131
I'd like to go
out in the garden, please.

451
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:16.329
You are just as tied to
me as I am to you.

452
01:06:02.895 --> 01:06:06.042
Day 2029.

453
01:06:08.495 --> 01:06:10.042
Not so much!

454
01:06:14.953 --> 01:06:20.289
Put the plate mats down first,
How many times do I have to tell you?


455
01:06:24.495 --> 01:06:26.042
You don't need one.

456
01:06:31.328 --> 01:06:33.877
Why do you have to do everything twice?

457
01:06:34.037 --> 01:06:37.012
I mean you have seven years walking back
and forth all the time?


458
01:06:37.037 --> 01:06:39.998
Hello, I 'em talking to you!

459
01:06:41.037 --> 01:06:42.584
And I'm listening.

460
01:06:43.453 --> 01:06:45.000
Go on!

461
01:06:47.662 --> 01:06:49.335
And the oil is getting too hot.

462
01:06:51.412 --> 01:06:52.959
Fish.

463
01:06:56.578 --> 01:07:01.755
Come on. Even my mother
does it ten times faster.


464
01:07:05.703 --> 01:07:08.126
What about something to drink?

465
01:07:08.453 --> 01:07:10.000
Yeah.

466
01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:17.544
Since when do you need panties?

467
01:07:18.787 --> 01:07:20.334
Yes?

468
01:07:30.328 --> 01:07:33.582
What are you brainless?
Put something down there!


469
01:07:33.953 --> 01:07:35.671
Put something down there!

470
01:07:37.412 --> 01:07:39.085
Get those coasters.

471
01:07:40.912 --> 01:07:43.210
You're worst than a dog!

472
01:07:43.745 --> 01:07:46.498
A dog you can teach!

473
01:07:51.912 --> 01:07:53.459
Go sit.

474
01:08:25.662 --> 01:08:29.041
And don't think for a minute
you're gonna have any of this.


475
01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:12.586
We need to change the filter.

476
01:10:13.287 --> 01:10:15.506
Go on.
You can get through there.


477
01:10:17.953 --> 01:10:21.287
<i>- I can't.
- Yes you can. Go on.</i>


478
01:10:21.495 --> 01:10:25.079
<i>- You need a plumber.
- No! I don't, and you know why?</i>


479
01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:26.902
Because of you I can't
let one into the house!


480
01:10:26.927 --> 01:10:30.214
Go on, or there
won't be any more water!

481
01:10:35.162 --> 01:10:36.709
Keep moving.

482
01:10:38.745 --> 01:10:40.839
That's it.

483
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.543
That's it. Go on!

484
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.125
That's it.

485
01:10:56.495 --> 01:10:58.748
Vivi?

486
01:11:08.537 --> 01:11:11.791
Come on. Can't you take a joke?

487
01:11:35.245 --> 01:11:36.792
No.

488
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:45.124
I went to three shops to find them.

489
01:12:58.412 --> 01:13:00.414
Don't even think about it.

490
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:05.920
I've got my gun and I'll kill anyone.

491
01:13:07.412 --> 01:13:08.959
Including you.

492
01:13:13.553 --> 01:13:15.500
Are we clear?

493
01:14:06.953 --> 01:14:08.500
I think my car is over there.

494
01:14:23.662 --> 01:14:25.380
Lilac.

495
01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:29.256
For the bedroom maybe.

496
01:14:30.287 --> 01:14:31.834
8721

497
01:14:33.245 --> 01:14:34.792
Take one.

498
01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:40.002
It will be enough for your room too.

499
01:14:55.828 --> 01:14:57.868
<i>- I couldn't find it.
- I'll show you. Come with me.</i>


500
01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.247
“Obey me, obey me.”

501
01:15:14.412 --> 01:15:18.167
Employees in the electrical please.

502
01:15:22.453 --> 01:15:27.380
It's extravagant for the bathroom,
I suppose, I like it though.


503
01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.542
Vivi.

504
01:16:08.745 --> 01:16:10.292
Go on. Go on.

505
01:16:13.537 --> 01:16:15.084
Vivi.

506
01:16:16.745 --> 01:16:18.928
Day 2175.

507
01:16:18.953 --> 01:16:20.500
Come here, Vivi.

508
01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.747
Come here.
Come here.


509
01:16:29.328 --> 01:16:30.875
Yeah...

510
01:16:35.203 --> 01:16:36.750
Yeah.

511
01:16:39.703 --> 01:16:41.250
Yes, it's very good.

512
01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:57.792
Surprise!

513
01:16:58.495 --> 01:17:00.122
Wow, lilac!

514
01:17:02.912 --> 01:17:06.291
<i>- Look. Hmm?
- Yeah, it's nice.</i>


515
01:17:07.412 --> 01:17:09.881
And see. All gold.

516
01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:14.752
I know, I put the tiles in myself.

517
01:17:23.662 --> 01:17:27.747
The Aphrodite bedroom.
Or do you like The Passion better?


518
01:17:28.787 --> 01:17:30.334
Well, take a pick.

519
01:17:31.703 --> 01:17:36.834
<i>- I'd like to grow my hair back.
- So we go for Aphrodite.</i>


520
01:17:37.912 --> 01:17:40.085
Yes.

521
01:17:41.787 --> 01:17:43.460
Oh, it's so nice.

522
01:17:44.912 --> 01:17:47.335
And the carpet, so pretty.

523
01:17:49.662 --> 01:17:51.209
The color...

524
01:17:52.453 --> 01:17:54.547
You have good taste.

525
01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.874
Well.
Plenty of room now for two...


526
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.623
Come on.
I've got a surprise.


527
01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:05.625
<i>- Now?
- Now!</i>


528
01:18:09.995 --> 01:18:14.125
I suppose everybody needs
somebody sometime, Am I right?


529
01:18:14.287 --> 01:18:15.834
You are.

530
01:18:16.203 --> 01:18:17.921
Now try it.

531
01:18:18.078 --> 01:18:21.207
<i>- That's very strong.
- Oh, don't be silly.</i>


532
01:18:27.787 --> 01:18:32.042
It's delicious.
I'm sure it will make me drunk.


533
01:18:40.328 --> 01:18:41.875
You are so funny.

534
01:18:42.078 --> 01:18:44.695
On a battling case in
Austria, it's been 6


535
01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:47.335
years since Natascha
Kampusch was kidnapped.


536
01:18:47.453 --> 01:18:51.913
On her way to school, there had
never been any real leads on the case.


537
01:18:52.037 --> 01:18:53.630
I 'em here.

538
01:18:53.828 --> 01:18:58.083
Many listeners will still recall
holding photos of the missing girl


539
01:18:58.245 --> 01:19:02.375
splashed across the bridge and grass
during the first months of…


540
01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:04.255
But I'm still alive...

541
01:19:04.412 --> 01:19:06.943
As an ever riding theme for this book,
It's terrifying.


542
01:19:07.112 --> 01:19:10.443
So many people disappear without a trace.

543
01:19:35.828 --> 01:19:39.913
Why are you lying in bed in
the middle of the day?


544
01:19:42.203 --> 01:19:43.750
Get up!

545
01:19:44.787 --> 01:19:46.334
Aphrodite is here.

546
01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:50.214
<i>- Who?
- Aphrodite.</i>


547
01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.084
The bedroom suite.

548
01:20:01.578 --> 01:20:03.125
Our wedding night.

549
01:20:22.828 --> 01:20:24.375
This is very nice.

550
01:20:31.203 --> 01:20:32.750
What?

551
01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.881
<i>- You do want to.
- No...</i>


552
01:20:37.287 --> 01:20:41.292
You belong to me, and I do
whatever I want with you.


553
01:20:46.828 --> 01:20:48.922
Why did you pick me?

554
01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:56.372
I saw your smile...

555
01:20:59.953 --> 01:21:01.830
I saw your smile.

556
01:21:05.162 --> 01:21:09.167
<i>- Hello, sweetheart, are you all right?
- Natascha, no more biscuits.</i>


557
01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:25.877
How long did it
take you to finish this?

558
01:21:28.412 --> 01:21:30.540
From June to the following March.

559
01:21:32.912 --> 01:21:35.210
The pipes and cables.

560
01:21:37.953 --> 01:21:39.500
The plastering.

561
01:21:41.328 --> 01:21:44.662
Always going to different
hardware stores to get things.


562
01:21:46.203 --> 01:21:48.626
Getting rid of the earth
in different places.


563
01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.428
Installing in the doors.

564
01:21:53.453 --> 01:21:55.330
Ventilation.

565
01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.625
All for you.

566
01:23:29.953 --> 01:23:31.546
Don't look at me that way.

567
01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.713
Stop looking at me!

568
01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.167
What's that smell?

569
01:26:52.287 --> 01:26:53.834
What are you up to?

570
01:26:54.453 --> 01:26:56.000
Nothing.

571
01:26:57.287 --> 01:27:00.666
You're not killing yourself,
you understand?


572
01:27:00.912 --> 01:27:04.712
You will not kill yourself, you understand?

573
01:27:05.703 --> 01:27:07.250
Look at me!

574
01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:16.209
Ah!
You...


575
01:27:16.578 --> 01:27:18.296
Will... not...

576
01:27:19.328 --> 01:27:20.875
kill...

577
01:27:22.828 --> 01:27:25.877
yourself!
Do you understand?


578
01:27:50.078 --> 01:27:52.922
Why do you have to ruin everything?

579
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.043
It could be so nice.

580
01:27:58.537 --> 01:28:00.460
But you ruin it.

581
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:11.917
Let me go...

582
01:28:14.370 --> 01:28:15.917
Never.

583
01:28:20.953 --> 01:28:23.172
Then one of us has to die.

584
01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:56.878
18 blows to the head.

585
01:29:06.078 --> 01:29:09.332
6 punches in the stomach

586
01:29:15.037 --> 01:29:17.756
12 strokes in the ear.

587
01:29:21.912 --> 01:29:25.337
4 kicks to the legs.

588
01:30:31.662 --> 01:30:33.255
Go on. Go on!

589
01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:45.673
Get up.
Don't act so helpless.


590
01:30:46.578 --> 01:30:48.672
I can't...
Come on!


591
01:30:52.787 --> 01:30:54.334
Go!

592
01:30:54.828 --> 01:30:56.375
Go!

593
01:30:59.203 --> 01:31:00.750
Oh, God!

594
01:31:04.078 --> 01:31:06.831
My knees are so shaky.
You're going to ski!


595
01:31:06.995 --> 01:31:08.423
<i>How much do you think
all this stuff costs?</i>


596
01:31:08.436 --> 01:31:09.874
<i>53 Euros.</i>

597
01:31:10.078 --> 01:31:12.080
<i>- What?
- € 53!</i>


598
01:31:12.245 --> 01:31:13.792
Then go.

599
01:31:30.662 --> 01:31:32.209
I'm gonna go.

600
01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:34.917
All right.

601
01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:43.168
Put on your sunglasses.

602
01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.667
Hello?

603
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:39.924
Please, can you help me!
I've been kidnapped.


604
01:32:39.937 --> 01:32:42.501
My name is Natascha Kampusch.

605
01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:21.624
What happened in that toilet?
Nothing...


606
01:33:23.953 --> 01:33:25.751
Don't lie to me.

607
01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:06.167
An 18...

608
01:35:07.537 --> 01:35:09.255
You want me to cut it?

609
01:35:21.495 --> 01:35:25.250
What, aren't you hungry? Hmm?
Take a much bigger.


610
01:35:27.578 --> 01:35:29.125
All right.

611
01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:36.585
All right.

612
01:35:41.328 --> 01:35:42.875
All right.

613
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:45.463
Happy Birthday.

614
01:35:47.745 --> 01:35:49.292
Thank you.

615
01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.588
A dress!
Put it on.


616
01:36:18.037 --> 01:36:19.584
Here...

617
01:36:30.787 --> 01:36:32.334
You want to dance?

618
01:36:33.453 --> 01:36:35.000
Yes?

619
01:36:37.245 --> 01:36:38.963
I am a good dancer.

620
01:36:53.287 --> 01:36:56.416
God... you can't even dance.
Come here.


621
01:36:56.787 --> 01:37:03.250
Slow, slow, wait, wait.
Slow, slow, wait, wait.


622
01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:06.829
Slow, slow, wait, wait.

623
01:37:40.495 --> 01:37:42.042
Hello!

624
01:37:44.287 --> 01:37:45.834
Hello.

625
01:37:56.662 --> 01:37:58.539
You're dumber than a dog!

626
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:51.546
I'm selling the van.
To have a bit of money.


627
01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:58.873
Got to get it nice clean.

628
01:39:04.537 --> 01:39:06.255
All right, vacuum it inside.

629
01:39:08.995 --> 01:39:13.000
I want it completely clean.
The seats as well as the floor.


630
01:39:13.412 --> 01:39:17.997
I'll do the windows. You won't,
'cause I just told you to vacuum.


631
01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:21.084
The mags!

632
01:40:14.453 --> 01:40:16.000
Oh...

633
01:40:21.037 --> 01:40:22.584
Hello?

634
01:40:23.662 --> 01:40:26.541
Yes.
It's about the Van.


635
01:40:27.037 --> 01:40:30.166
Say. Hold a moment.
One second...


636
01:40:33.162 --> 01:40:35.881
Right. Sorry...
Just a second.


637
01:40:37.162 --> 01:40:41.963
No, not yet.
It is still for sale.


638
01:40:43.578 --> 01:40:46.502
Uh, I think It had two previous owners.

639
01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:11.339
Come tomorrow at two...

640
01:41:57.953 --> 01:42:02.254
Hello? Hello, can you help me?
Please call the police!


641
01:42:02.453 --> 01:42:04.944
<i>What are you doing
in my garden?</i>


642
01:42:04.957 --> 01:42:07.459
<i>Natascha Kampusch!
It's about a kidnapping!</i>


643
01:42:07.953 --> 01:42:10.454
Day 3096.

644
01:42:19.412 --> 01:42:24.339
Right, stay where you are, please!
Is this the girl you phone me about?


645
01:42:24.495 --> 01:42:27.339
<i>- Yes.
- Do you have any form of identification?</i>


646
01:42:29.703 --> 01:42:34.539
<i>- Do you have any form of identification?
- My name is Natascha Kampusch.</i>


647
01:42:35.245 --> 01:42:37.794
I was kidnapped eight years ago.

648
01:42:47.453 --> 01:42:49.000
Hello?

649
01:42:49.745 --> 01:42:51.292
Speaking...

650
01:43:13.162 --> 01:43:14.709
Any news of him?

651
01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:13.292
Mom...

652
01:44:53.162 --> 01:44:55.039
<i>- Here.
- Thank you.</i>


653
01:44:56.287 --> 01:44:57.834
It's okay.

654
01:45:03.578 --> 01:45:06.707
Do not be afraid.

655
01:45:32.828 --> 01:45:37.129
It was clear.
Only one of us would survive.


656
01:45:38.287 --> 01:45:39.880
And at the end it was me.

657
01:45:40.412 --> 01:45:41.959
Not him.

658
01:48:30.412 --> 01:48:35.959
