00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.406
Lookie here.

9
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.118
My day is made. [laughs]

10
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.163
I didn't even finish breakfast
and I get to kill me a stinkin' Injun.


11
00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.583
Injun?

12
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.085
Nah.

13
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.797
I just dress like this so's I don't get
scalped out on the prairie.


14
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.925
Oh, well, that's a convincing outfit.

15
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.387
Yeah, you can't be too safe out there...

16
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.015
with all of them savages runnin' around.

17
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.892
So, what can I do you for?

18
00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:43.186
Need some flour.
Five sacks.


19
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.523
And a carrot with peanut butter on it.

20
00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.108
Now, what's that gonna run me?

21
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:51.111
Well, sack of flour's 45 cents.

22
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.446
So, five sacks...

23
00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.491
is 40...

24
00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.285
Wanna get back to me on that?

25
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.328
Yeah, look...

26
00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.039
Now, the flour's in the basement.

27
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.332
You can fetch it yourself.

28
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.458
Much obliged.

29
00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.438
Well, lookie what we got here.

30
00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:30.776
Sweet piece of red prairie meat
out all by her lonesome.


31
00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:35.488
-What do you make of that, Nelly?
-Oh, I think she's waiting on you, Will.


32
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.116
[laughing and jeering]

33
00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.078
[Nelly Patch] Go on, get on it.
[man 1] It's on now.


34
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.454
[man 2] Yeah.
[Nelly Patch] Go get her, Will.


35
00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:43.538
[man 1] Oh, oh, oh.

36
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.873
[Nelly Patch] Here we go.

37
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:51.213
Now, you must be wondering why five badass
hombres with perfect jawlines...


38
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.427
all sport the same stylish eye patch.

39
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.471
Not my business.

40
00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:04.017
[laughs] We all carved our eyeballs
out our skull


41
00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:07.562
to show how devoted
we are to this gang.

-Yeah!
-[woman screams]


45
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.195
Hey!

46
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.073
You got real pretty eyes, miss.

47
00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.283
You reckon we can,
I don't know, borrow one?


48
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.369
-[screaming]
-Can we borrow one?


49
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.210
Now, is that a proper question
to ask a lady?


50
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:33.338
Who are you, slick?
The boyfriend?


51
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.506
[laughing]

52
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.633
Soon to be the husband.

53
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.593
[Will Patch scoffs]

54
00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:41.972
Oh, wait a minute!
That's a white boy under that getup.


55
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.850
That's a white boy? Oh, shit.

56
00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:48.145
You partial to pale faces, 
Poca-hot-tits?

57
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.229
-Huh?
-[laughing]


58
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.774
'Cause I can show you
what a real white man's like.


59
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:55.235
-Yeah, show her, Will. Yeah, go on.
-Yeah, shuffle up, Will.


60
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.737
-Dance now, boy.
-Shuffle on over.


61
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.489
-There you go.
-That's some white boy shit right there.


62
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.324
Now, I do want
to carve my eyes out.

63
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.951
-What'd you say?
-Hey, fellers...


64
00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:05.996
I'd hit the trail before you get hurt.

65
00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.874
[snickering] Before we get hurt?

66
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.543
-Before we get hurt.
-[laughing]


67
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:15.588
I think you've been smokin' too much
of that peace pipe, kemo-slobby.


68
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.134
-[Left-Eye Boys laughing]
-Now, from what I see, there's one of you,


69
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.553
and there's five of us.

70
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.393
Four of you.

71
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.228
What just happened?

72
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:31.604
You wanna see it again?

73
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:34.441
Uh... yes.

74
00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.196
[screaming]

75
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:40.989
[grunts]

76
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.830
-I don't like this shit.
-Shut up.


77
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.042
Well, that's some, uh...
real fancy footwork.


78
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.880
But I think this hullabaloo has escalated
to the firearms stage.


79
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.225
Boys, let's ventilate this.

80
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.018

[men screaming]

84
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:33.000
What the shit that just happened?

85
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.835
[mumbling gibberish]

86
00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:44.802
[weakly] What the hell?
What in the hell?


87
00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.393
"Hit the trail."
It was so simple.


88
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.939
You must stop doing this, White Knife.
One day, there will be too many.


89
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:58.150
But not today, Smoking Fox.

90
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:01.153
Please, my love...
we must go.


91
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.947
[shouting] What the hell
happened out here?


92
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.241
Injuns.
They went that way.


93
00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.951
You ain't no white man.

94
00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:11.246
You're that orphan, White Knife.

95
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:14.958
Raised like an animal with those Apaches.

96
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.127
[scoffs] You think you can fool ol' Clem?

97
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.336
Sorry, Ringo.

98
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.382
Well, now I'm gonna shoot you
and your Injun whore.


99
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:23.633
Gotta cut breakfast short.

100
00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:28.680
[screaming]

101
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.099
You suck, mister!

102
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.893
[shouting] You suck!

103
00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.773
What are you?

104
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.659

[indistinct chattering]

107
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:02.965
[child] Yes, White Knife.

108
00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.299
Go, White Knife.

109
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.722
[all cheering] Yay!

110
00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.432
You lucky, Smoking Fox.

111
00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.602
White Knife all man.
Bravest of all braves.


112
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.022
Not brave. Foolish.

113
00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:21.483
I want to be wife, not widow.

114
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.902
[horse neighs]

115
00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.614
Afternoon, ladies.

116
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.575
[screaming and shouting]

117
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.372
This is Apache land.

118
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.166
I'm not here to take your land, Chief.

119
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.169
I'm just looking for a particular boy.

120
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.047
I'm Frank Stockburn.

121
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.841
This boy's mother was my wife.

122
00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.802
And the boy, Tommy...

123
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.389
he's my son.

124
00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.143
[indigenous music playing]

125
00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:06.861
[chuckling]

126
00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:09.697
It is wise to be slow to trust,
White Knife.


127
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:13.118
But every new journey begins
with a single step.


128
00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:15.953
Speak with your father.

129
00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.124
But you are my father,
Screaming Eagle.


130
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.501
Ever since my mother...

131
00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.547
Ever since you found me...

132
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.882
you taught me to hunt,
to fight...


133
00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.094
when to speak and when to be silent.

134
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.388
-To be a man.
-A good man.


135
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.098
And this Frank Stockburn,

136
00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:38.643
he is filled with lies,
just like every other white man.


137
00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:42.439
Sometimes, the white man speaks the truth.

138
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.233
Like, one in 20, 25 times.

139
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.029
I believe this is one of those times.

140
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.532
He knew your mother, White Knife.

141
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:56.494
Maybe he can give you some peace.
Talk to him.


142
00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.164
Maybe after I close my eyes to dream.

143
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.269
[crying]

144
00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:24.106
Mommy!

145
00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:26.108
[metal clanging]

146
00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:37.869
[metal clanging]

147
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:51.674
[groans] Oh, no.

148
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.727
One look at me, and you knew your old man
had done a lot of bad things, didn't ya?


149
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.273
I cheated men, 
I killed men...

150
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.693
So I deserve whatever's comin' to me.

151
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.445
[sighs]

152
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:16.366
The only one that ever saw any good in me
was your mother.


153
00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:21.121
Oh!

154
00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.705
Why have you come here?

155
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:26.918
Not a man for chitchat, huh?
[chuckles]


156
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.087
Well, me neither.

157
00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.591
Kid, I'm dying...

158
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.178
of consumption.

159
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.096
[chuckling]

160
00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.974
Don't worry...

161
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:47.189
I'm not looking
for no big father-son hoo-ah.


162
00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:48.773
"I love you, son."

163
00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:50.567
[imitates child's voice]
"I love you too, Daddy."


164
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.819
[chuckling]

165
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.987
[coughing]

166
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.490
No.

167
00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:03.371
I've come for a more tangible reason.

168
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:12.922
Tommy, I've been stealing from folks
since I was nine years old...


169
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:19.136
and that's the way I've amassed
a good little fortune.


170
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.849
[sighs] I wanna do something
decent with it.


171
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.769
I want to give it to you, son.

172
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.025
I don't want your money.

173
00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:36.696
But maybe you could give...

174
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:41.158
$50,000 to these nice Injuns
who raised you.


175
00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:42.452
We'll take it.

176
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.704
Go back to bed.

177
00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:46.331
Sorry.

178
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.207
Seriously, though,
we'll take it.


179
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.753
Look, it's buried in the meadow
just up the trail,


180
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.921
next to a big ol' pine tree.

181
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:56.383
What do you say
we go dig it up in the morning


182
00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.469
and start playing Santa Claus?

183
00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.222
I don't remember much about my mother...

184
00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:06.768
but I do remember her telling me...

185
00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.187
you were dead.

186
00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:12.940
[clicks tongue]

187
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.318
[exhales]

188
00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.987
Maybe it was because...

189
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.408
she didn't want
you to come looking for me.


190
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.576
She was a smart lady.

191
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:28.706
Only stupid thing she ever did
was fall for me.


192
00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.334
Meeting Betty Dunson...

193
00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:35.212
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.


194
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:41.636
From the first day
I laid eyes on her...

195
00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:44.556
she was bawlin' out this...

196
00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:49.561
half-drunk, big ol' burly blacksmith...

197
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:52.188
down at Silver Canyon.

198
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.358
She's been the only one, Tommy.

199
00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.075
Mom had a temper?

200
00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:10.122
[chuckling] Temper?
When she got her dander up, look out.


201
00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.041
We was in a saloon once.

202
00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.293
This fellow sitting next to her

203
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:19.382
starts talking about the perfect way
to make a cherry pie...


204
00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:24.261
So your mom says to me,
"Frank, come here a minute.


205
00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:28.099
Tell me again,
just where did you get them flowers?"


206
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:32.228
I said, "I know that you think
I stole them from the graveyard."


207
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.980
[both chuckling]

208
00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.065
Good morning, boys.

209
00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.568
Morning, Never Wears Bra.

210
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.488
I had dream about you last night,
White Knife.


211
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.406
Oh, that's nice.

212
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.741
Not nice dream.

213
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:47.952
In dream, you naughty.

214
00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:50.162
You naughty, White Knife.

215
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.499
Mmm, somebody's got an admirer.

216
00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.626
-[chuckles]
-Yes, yes.


217
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:57.712
But like you,
there's only one woman for me.


218
00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.886
I guess we Stockburns are...

219
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.721
partial to the sweet ones.

220
00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.180
Yes, sir.

221
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.057
Like your mother.

222
00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.854
How did she die, Tommy?

223
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.231
You tell me?

224
00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:24.280
Well, there were these big kids at school
fixin' to beat me up.


225
00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:30.327
Instead of facing them myself,
I had her walk me there.


226
00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.415
This feller comes out of nowhere...

227
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.126
walks right up to
her and shoots her dead.

228
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.173
So that's how she died,
protecting her gutless son


229
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:46.343
instead of being home,
safe where she belonged.


230
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.515
[horses neighing]

231
00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:51.933
[men shouting]

232
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.644
Who's that?
Is that Bony Express?


233
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.605
[Tommy] Bony Express
don't come around here.


234
00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:59.566
[howling]

235
00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.192
-[man] Giddyap!
-[howling continues]


236
00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:02.819
[screaming]

237
00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:15.623
He's here somewhere, boys.

238
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:16.916
Let's burn him out!

239
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.418
[Bony Express Gang shouting]

240
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.544
[man] Oh...

241
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.546
Next one goes through your forehead.

242
00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.382
Hey, hey!
No need to burn nothing, boys!


243
00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:27.469
Howdy, boss.

244
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.678
Cicero...

245
00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:33.683
you're not gonna let a man
enjoy his retirement, are ya?


246
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:38.312
No, Frank, I salute your decision
to turn from your sinful ways.


247
00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:40.147
But the money...

248
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.941
that belongs to all of us.

249
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:43.359
Touch that steel, boy,

250
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.613
I got plenty of bullets left over
after I put one in...


251
00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.575
your father.

252
00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.368
[chuckles]

253
00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:55.538
Oh, you finally found your long lost son.

254
00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.958
Well, I sure hate to break up
this nice family reunion.


255
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.336
So, why don't you give us
the money you stole


256
00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:05.214
before I put lead in your head.

257
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.514
The money's buried.

258
00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:14.807
Way to run your mouth, son.

259
00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.308
It's buried?

260
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.144
Yeah, I buried it.

261
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:21.731
Deep in the ground...
next to a windmill.


262
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.108
A windmill in the West...

263
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:26.318
doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.

264
00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.780
Well, this is a special windmill.

265
00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.574
It's a singing windmill.

266
00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.450
[all laughing]

267
00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:34.952
[Cicero] A singing windmill!

268
00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.249
It's about a ten-day ride from here.

269
00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:43.377
I'll lead you to it presently
on one condition.


270
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.797
You don't hurt my boy...

271
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.300
or any of these kindly Injuns here.

272
00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:52.428
Let's ride, Frank.

273
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.180
[speaking Spanish]

274
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:07.985
Frank, if that $50,000
isn't under that windmill,


275
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.779
I'm gonna bury you up to your neck

276
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.448
and let the desert critters eat you alive.

277
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.909
It's there, Cicero, it's there.

278
00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:18.705
I'm glad I got
to meet Betty Dunson's son.

279
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:21.874
You just stay here, Tommy.

280
00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.293
Enjoy your life
with your beautiful bride...


281
00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:29.423
amongst these majestic pine trees.

282
00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:32.760
Let's go!

283
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.158
Well, that was uncool.

284
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:08.630
White Knife, you must rest.

285
00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.172
How can I rest?

286
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.926
When they get to the singing windmill
and find no money, they will kill him.


287
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.305
My son, there are too many trees
and too little time.


288
00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:22.977
Then I must get this $50,000 another way.

289
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.981
How? By stealing?
There is no honor in that.


290
00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:32.403
Unless I steal from those
who have no honor.


291
00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:35.698
Ooh... I like that.

292
00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.700
But it is too dangerous.

293
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.244
I will send ten of our
strongest braves with you.


294
00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:41.663
No.

295
00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.791
The braves would be treated too cruelly
in the white man's world.


296
00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:47.084
A lot of them
can pass for pale face.

297
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:50.379
Raging Bear can actually do
a great impression of a white guy.


298
00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:54.425
Hey, guys, let's play with our chest hair
and eat potato chips.


299
00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:56.135
[all laughing]

300
00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.931
Wasn't that great?
Where does he come up with this stuff?


301
00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:03.768
That's very good, Bear,
but I must walk this path alone.


302
00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:08.690
My love...
I will get this money...


303
00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.067
bring it to the singing windmill,

304
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.235
and be back in time for our wedding.

305
00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.196
I won't let you go.

306
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.448
Those men are killers.

307
00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:21.828
I was a coward once
and my mother paid the price.


308
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:26.165
That will not happen to my father.

309
00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:44.976
Whoa!

310
00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:47.228
-[horse neighs]
-Good morning.


311
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:49.146
Where in the hell did you come from?

312
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.315
I'm in a bit of a bind, boys.

313
00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:54.193
I rode all the way out here
to pan for gold


314
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.320
and my horse up and died on me.

315
00:19:56.403 --> 00:19:57.905
How'd he die?

316
00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:59.615
Suicide.

317
00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.492
Drowned himself.

318
00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:04.954
Put his head in the stream
and just kept it there.


319
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.622
Saddest thing you ever seen.

320
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:08.624
It happens.

321
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.668
Powers that be don't like to admit it,
but it happens.


322
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:13.921
He looks like an honest white guy.

323
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:15.757
Hop on.

324
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.674
Much obliged.

325
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.095
[Tommy] Just drop me off
at the nearest town.


326
00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:28.728
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around.


327
00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:31.898
Hear the wondrous effects
of Dr. Chubb's Vita Oil,


328
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.358
the miracle cure for 1001 ailments.

329
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:36.277
Put the pep back in your--

330
00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:38.070
Who's this asshole?

331
00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.448
[indistinct chattering]

332
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:55.797
Well, now, look at this fella,
drinking from the horse trough.


333
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.881
Excuse me.

334
00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.383
You there!

335
00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:03.512
What you're doing is disgusting.

336
00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:05.932
That water is for our filthy horses.

337
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:10.311
Water flows from the sky spirit
for all its children.


338
00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:11.603
Isn't that right, cousin?

339
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:15.649
We don't cotton to that peyote-smoking
nonsense around these parts.


340
00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:17.693
Do you hear me, "cousin"?

341
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:22.031
[chuckling] Okay, 
William, come on back.

342
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.574
Hey, amigo.

343
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.202
You planning on staying in town?

344
00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.663
Might need a place
to lay my head for a bit.


345
00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:40.883
Sorry about that ugly man
that insulted you.


346
00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:45.096
He runs the bank, so he thinks
he's entitled to be mean to everyone.


347
00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:47.056
There's a bank in this town?

348
00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.850
Why? You wanna rob it?

349
00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:52.144
I look like a
bank robber to you, ma'am?

350
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:57.149
Funny, there's something about you that
reminds me of a certain bank robber.


351
00:21:57.774 --> 00:21:59.693
His name was Frank Stockburn.

352
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.155
You know Frank Stockburn?

353
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.324
"Know"? Like, in the biblical sense?

354
00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.828
No, ma'am.
You've met him before is what I'm asking.


355
00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:11.288
Yes, I met him.

356
00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:12.832
Then, 20 minutes later,

357
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:16.377
I knew him in the biblical sense
on that bed, right there.


358
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.461
Oh.

359
00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:22.424
And, I knew him, in the biblical sense,
twice on this railing.


360
00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:23.509
Uh-huh.

361
00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:27.930
And then, while doing a handstand
on that dresser you're leaning against.


362
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:33.727
Did he happen to mention
a singing windmill?


363
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.647
He did mention a singing windmill.

364
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.608
He said it sounded
like a choir of angels.

365
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.402
Where'd he say it was?

366
00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:46.490
He said that it was in a place
where he made his biggest score.


367
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:48.617
Whatever that was.

368
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.952
And then he laughed.

369
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:52.246
He liked to laugh...

370
00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:54.331
and have handstand sex.

371
00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:56.292
Yeah, we gotta get past that.

372
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.626
I miss him.

373
00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.670
But he did leave me something
to remember him by.


374
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.130
What's this?

375
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:04.633
A niño, Ramon.

376
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.844
I have a brother?

377
00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:11.890
Oh, Burro, we had many adventures
together, you and me.


378
00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:13.475
We're not getting any younger.

379
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:14.851
[chuckles]

380
00:23:14.936 --> 00:23:17.646
At least we have our memories.

381
00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.398
[laughing]

382
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:23.444
Remember the two girls,
the sisters, in Deadwood?


383
00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:24.820
You liked the fat one.

384
00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.488
[laughing]

385
00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:28.157
You know it's true.

386
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.741
[Tommy] Ramon Lopez?

387
00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:32.078
Sí.

388
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:37.874
I just came from conversating
with your mother, Esmerelda.


389
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:42.879
We stumbled upon the fact that
your dad and my dad...


390
00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:46.217
are the same fella.

391
00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:48.385
Oh, that's neat.

392
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:50.137
Yeah.

393
00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:52.431
Same father.

394
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.600
Half-brothers.

395
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:56.643
What do you think about that, Burro?

396
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.356
So, how is Dad?

397
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.525
Well, he went and got himself kidnapped,

398
00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:07.446
and I need to come up with $50,000
to save his life.


399
00:24:08.322 --> 00:24:09.906
That's a lot of pesos.

400
00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:11.117
Sure is.

401
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:15.412
That's why I'm fixin'
to rob the bank here in town.


402
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.748
Hang on.

403
00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:21.418
My father is in trouble.

404
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:24.421
My brother, he needs my help.

405
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:28.134
I'll rob the bank with you.

406
00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:30.136
I must do this alone.

407
00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.765
What's happening right now?

408
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:38.769
Ever since I'm pequeño,

409
00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:43.607
I dream about spending
one magical day with mi padre,


410
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.569
sharing meals,
introducing him to the burro.


411
00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:53.450
I will not let go of you
until you say I can help you.


412
00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:03.169
Will you stop brushing me
if I say yes?


413
00:25:03.252 --> 00:25:04.336
Yes.

414
00:25:06.297 --> 00:25:07.756
Then you can help.

415
00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:14.305
[farting]

416
00:25:21.145 --> 00:25:23.314
That means he likes you.

417
00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:25.274
[horse whinnying]

418
00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.858
[indistinct chatter]

419
00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.251
That's a good amount of money
you want us to lend you.


420
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:47.379
Now, normally, we would require
two forms of identification, madam,


421
00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:50.424
but that won't be necessary in your case.

422
00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:53.427
-[woman sighs]
-I feel kinda guilty about this, Burro,


423
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.346
taking money from nice people.

424
00:25:55.429 --> 00:25:57.764
I mean, it's not like
you're some greasy Mexican.


425
00:25:57.848 --> 00:25:59.600
-[speaking gibberish]
-[laughing]


426
00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:01.143
I feel less guilty now.

427
00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.938
What are you doing?

428
00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:06.940
This is a bank!

429
00:26:07.023 --> 00:26:08.775
Get that donkey out of here!

430
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:10.569
It is a burro, señor.

431
00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:13.447
I don't care, "señor."
Get it out!


432
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.282
All right.
Vámonos.


433
00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:19.161
The burro don't want to vámonos.

434
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:23.124
Well, I don't really care
what the burro wants.


435
00:26:26.042 --> 00:26:29.087
Get out of my bank, you beast!

436
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:31.632
I know what you're thinking,
but not yet.


437
00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:33.008
Hold it.

438
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.010
[bank manager straining] Move!

439
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.024
How is this jackass stuck?

440
00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:51.902
If it got in here,
it can certainly get out!


441
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:54.696
It doesn't make sense,
it's not logical.


442
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:57.699
They got it locked up good,
do they?


443
00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:01.119
Oh! You are leaving!

444
00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:03.414
[groans]

445
00:27:03.497 --> 00:27:04.665
[laughs]

446
00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:07.668
Gall dang,
he felled on his pooper!


447
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:09.503
[laughing]

448
00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:23.600
-[bank manager] That makes no sense!
-[Ramon stammering] I apologize.


449
00:27:23.684 --> 00:27:26.019
-I don't know how many times I could--
-Hey, friend.


450
00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:27.938
Need any help gettin' her out?

451
00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:30.649
[quietly] She's not
really stuck, amigo.


452
00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:32.318
She's just a diversion.

453
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:34.528
She's a virgin?

454
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.697
I'm a virgin, too...

455
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.740
unless you count canty-loupes.

456
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.827
I believe that,
but she's a diversion


457
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.495
to keep the banker busy

458
00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:46.248
so that my brother has time
to rob the bank.


459
00:27:46.332 --> 00:27:48.417
[stammers] You're robbin' the bank?

460
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.211
-Gall dang!
-Shh, shh.


461
00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:52.796
[whispers] Gall dang.
Gall dang. Gall dang.

Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.437
No! Virgil! Virgil, the key!

466
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.774
I'm Lil Pete.

467
00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.485
So, is your father, like, Big Pete?

468
00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:16.570
I didn't know my pa.

469
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:19.990
But he was a bank robber like y'all!
His name was Frank.


470
00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:22.909
-Stockburn?
-How'd you know?


471
00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:25.662
Are you a wizard?

472
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:31.001
[Frank] Hey, Johnny Law.

473
00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:34.838
We'll be waiting for you
up at Jawbone Falls.

00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:36.423
Frank Stockburn.

475
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.091
What?

476
00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:39.301
Robbery!

477
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:41.637
We're being burgled!

478
00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:45.140
You! Horse-water-drinker!

479
00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:46.558
You are caught, sir!

-[gun clicking]
-[bank manager] Oh!

What are you?

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:04.117
Hey, Tommy, guess what?
We got ourselves a little brother.


483
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.329
Yeah! All our moms got porked
by the same outlaw.


484
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:09.290
-Ain't that a pip?
-Yeah, that's something.


485
00:29:09.373 --> 00:29:12.167
Hey! Those bandidos just robbed the bank!

486
00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:13.377
[crowd screaming]

487
00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:17.464
Taste my bullets,
you dirty foreigners!


488
00:29:17.548 --> 00:29:19.007
Now!

489
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.805
-Nice one, Burro.
-Wow!


490
00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:26.181
-There they are!
-[Ramon] We better make tracks.


491
00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:27.766
Can I come with?
I got a wagon.


492
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:29.726
All right, that ain't a bad idea,
let's go.


493
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.312
[Ramon] Vámonos. Come on!

494
00:29:32.354 --> 00:29:34.064
[Lil Pete] So, if you guys are
my brothers,


495
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:35.899
you must got three nipples, too.

496
00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:37.192
[Ramon] I only got two.

497
00:29:37.276 --> 00:29:38.819
[Tommy] Yeah, just got the two.

498
00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:41.112
[Lil Pete] Oh, must be
from my mama's side.


499
00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:43.073
Forget I tolded you that, okay?

500
00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:44.240
[Tommy] Will do.

501
00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.536
[Will Patch] Are you ready, Clem?

502
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:51.122
[Clem] Yep, yep. I'm... I'm ready.

503
00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:58.505
Spoon.

504
00:30:00.256 --> 00:30:01.550
Damn sharp.

505
00:30:07.013 --> 00:30:12.644
Look, fellas, I wanna hunt
this white Injun down same as you.


506
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:14.480
But, uh... I...

507
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:17.816
I have some problems with my eyes.

508
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:21.903
You wanna join the Left-Eye Gang,
that right eye has gotta come out.


509
00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:23.989
It'll only hurt for a second.

510
00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:26.658
Yeah, like a hundred seconds.

511
00:30:26.742 --> 00:30:29.620
-Then you're one of us.
-For life.


512
00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:32.664
Okay, that makes sense.

513
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:38.462
Is it okay if I
scoop this left eye out?

514
00:30:38.545 --> 00:30:40.296
This is... I'm basically blind here.

515
00:30:40.381 --> 00:30:42.549
This right one sees like an eagle.

516
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:45.552
Yeah, it just seems
like a waste that I'd...


517
00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:48.972
I understand your predicament,
but rules is rules.


518
00:30:49.055 --> 00:30:51.558
Yeah, guess it... makes sense.

519
00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:55.521
[breathing heavily]

520
00:30:57.022 --> 00:30:58.482
Oh, God!

521
00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:00.942
-[Clem grunting]
-[Gus Patch] Hell, no!


522
00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:03.737
That ain't right!

523
00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:06.156
-[grunts]
-[Gus Patch] Damn!


524
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:07.574
[Will Patch] It's half way.

525
00:31:07.658 --> 00:31:09.451
-It's dangling by a vein!
-[Clem] Whoo! Oh, man!


526
00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:11.828
It's crazy,
I can still see out of it!


527
00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:13.329
-Goddamn, it hurts!
-I think I'm gonna puke.


528
00:31:13.414 --> 00:31:16.708
It's just going round and round like
a tassel on a stripper's titty!


529
00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:18.377
Okay, gotta get it, gotta get it!

530
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.003
I'm getting dizzy!

531
00:31:20.086 --> 00:31:21.755
Got it, got it, got it!

532
00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:22.839
Yeah!

533
00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:24.633
[groaning] Ah!

534
00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:27.594
Oh, Lord! Holy shit.

535
00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:32.474
You done it, partner.
Welcome to the Left-Eye Gang.


536
00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:33.600
Whoo!

537
00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:34.935
I did it!

538
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:38.104
[laughing] I'm glad that's done.

539
00:31:38.188 --> 00:31:41.066
Let's just go get that
Injun-loving son of a bitch, huh?


540
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:42.192
Yeah.

541
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.360
-Yeah! Let's get him.
-Yeah.


542
00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:46.655
Like, so...

543
00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.824
Oh, I touched the hole.
I touched the hole!


544
00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:53.704
Got me a patch! [chuckles]

545
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.585
[Lil Pete] Dear Mama,
you may be wondering


546
00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:03.839
why I have not returned
from my trip to the ice cream store.


547
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:08.301
It's because I met my brothers,
Ramon and Tommy.


548
00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:10.554
And we're trying to steal money.

549
00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:14.182
We need the money
to give to the bad men


550
00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:19.104
who took Pa away
to the land of the singing windmill.


551
00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:24.067
Tommy says it's not okay
to take money from decent folks.


552
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.151
I got the money!

553
00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:27.988
Luckily, there's a lot of bad people
here in the West.


554
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:29.656
Yee-haw!

555
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.949
Let's ride!

556
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:36.455
-[Ramon] Eat it! You know you like it.
-[Lil Pete laughing]


557
00:32:36.538 --> 00:32:38.248
[Ramon] You know you like it.

558
00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:40.125
Good God!

559
00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:42.711
[laughing] Good burro!

560
00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.045
[Ramon] That's right.

561
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.130
Enjoy it!

562
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:48.634
-That's just wrong.
-Yeah, yeah.


563
00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:49.718
Is it?

564
00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:00.896
[Lil Pete continues laughing]

565
00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:04.483
[laughing]

566
00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:07.903
This is so much better
than the cantaloupe.


567
00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:09.738
[continues laughing]

568
00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:13.992
Good burro!

569
00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:16.828
[Lil Pete] Slowly, but surely,

570
00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:21.667
we're chippin' away
at the $50,000 we need to save Pa.


571
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.169
That's a lot of money,
isn't it, Mama?


572
00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:26.880
Mama?

573
00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:33.011
[laughs] Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm writing you a letter.


574
00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:38.349
Anyways, I can't wait
to actually meet my pa.


575
00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:40.977
I want him to teach me
how you make babies.


576
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:44.523
And how the lady poops 'em out.

577
00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:47.067
Be home quick as I can.

578
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.361
Your loving son, Lil Pete.

579
00:33:51.697 --> 00:33:53.198
[crow cawing]

580
00:34:14.678 --> 00:34:15.929
Tommy?

581
00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:17.806
Yeah, Lil Pete?

582
00:34:18.724 --> 00:34:20.642
Where's the singing windmill?

583
00:34:20.726 --> 00:34:23.269
It's where dad made
his biggest score.


584
00:34:24.688 --> 00:34:27.440
Maybe we'll get another clue
up at Jawbone Falls.


585
00:34:27.523 --> 00:34:30.944
That's where he used to hide out
when he was an outlaw.


586
00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:34.155
[laughs] Oh, cool beans.

587
00:34:37.826 --> 00:34:39.077
Tommy?

588
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.079
Yeah, Lil Pete?

589
00:34:42.038 --> 00:34:44.040
If we get caught stealing...

590
00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:46.417
would we be in trouble?

591
00:34:49.545 --> 00:34:51.006
I reckon we'll hang.

592
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.928
Well... that's no bother.

593
00:34:58.013 --> 00:34:59.931
I got a real strong neck.

594
00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:03.977
Mama makes me pull the plow with my head
if I don't finish my schoolwork.


595
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.730
[chuckling] Which occurs regularilly.

596
00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:11.359
Strong neck might come in handy.

597
00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:14.320
Okay, let's get our rest.

598
00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:17.783
Good night, Tommy.

599
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.535
Good night, Lil Pete.

600
00:35:20.619 --> 00:35:23.038
[Lil Pete] Good night, Ramon.

601
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.539
[Ramon] Good night, brothers.

602
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.708
Good night, Burro.

603
00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:28.376
[farts]

604
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.673
[Ramon] That's a dry one.

605
00:35:32.756 --> 00:35:34.716
We will have good dry weather tomorrow.

606
00:35:41.347 --> 00:35:42.724
[sighs]

607
00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:47.187
[fly buzzing]

608
00:35:48.438 --> 00:35:49.981
[Lil Pete] Shoo, fly!

609
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:51.191
Shoo!

610
00:35:53.694 --> 00:35:56.822
[Ramon] Oh, come on, fly, vámonos!
We need our sleep.


611
00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.533
[fly continues buzzing]

612
00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:02.828
[Tommy] Let me take care of this.

613
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:04.663
[Ramon] How can you see
a fly in the dark?

614
00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:07.999
[Tommy] A true hunter sees
with all his senses.


615
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.669
[buzzing stops]

616
00:36:13.379 --> 00:36:15.506
[Ramon] That was some mystical shit, man.

617
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.051
[shrill buzzing]

618
00:36:18.969 --> 00:36:20.053
[Lil Pete] Uh-oh.

619
00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:22.513
I think you just nicked his biscuits off.

620
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.766
[Tommy] That's what I was aiming for.

621
00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:27.518
He didn't deserve to die.

622
00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:31.106
He deserved to know
he was not welcome here.


623
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:34.067
[Ramon] Raised by Indians, huh?

624
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.236
That had some impact on you.

625
00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:39.322
[fly buzzing]

626
00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:41.282
[Ramon] Well, let me get this one.

627
00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:43.576
[gunshots]

628
00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:48.081
-[horse neighing]
-[thudding]


629
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:51.376
[Ramon] Sounded like a horse fly.

630
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.254
That wasn't a horse fly,
that was my horse!


631
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:55.797
Peanut?

632
00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:57.673
Oh, Peanut!

633
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:01.970
[Ramon] Oh, the burro's gonna be pissed.

634
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:04.723
[Ramon] You're doing bueno, Burro!

635
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:07.683
Don't be intimidated by the horse,
you're just as good as him.


636
00:37:07.768 --> 00:37:09.685
[Lil Pete] I'm so hungry.

637
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.897
[Tommy] There's breakfast all around.

638
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:16.777
Nuts, berries, bark,
different kinds of mud.


639
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.029
I wish there were taco trees.

640
00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:20.571
What's a taco?

641
00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:22.073
They're the best.

642
00:37:22.157 --> 00:37:25.786
Meat and cheese and tomatoes
in a crispy shell.


643
00:37:25.869 --> 00:37:27.287
You'd love it, man.

644
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.790
Ooh, I want one.
I want 50.


645
00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:32.542
Hate to put an end
to this fascinating conversation,


646
00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:33.626
but we're here.

And there's a mansion next to it!

[knocking]

650
00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:50.226
Should we just go in?

651
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:53.146
I reckon.

652
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:03.698
[Tommy] Hello?

653
00:38:06.159 --> 00:38:07.202
[Ramon] Hola.

654
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.834
[chuckles] Well, this is cozy.

Hold on!

662
00:38:42.528 --> 00:38:45.448
[Lil Pete] Stop! 
Leave my brother alone!

663
00:38:45.531 --> 00:38:47.617
No, no, no!

664
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.911
Simon says, "Stop!"

665
00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:52.538
Don't hurt my brother!

-Stop!
-Huh?

[Ramon screaming]

668
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.173
Good thinking, Tommy.

669
00:39:02.257 --> 00:39:03.258
[Tommy] All right.

670
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:05.551
Not for me, but good one, Tommy.

[grunting]

672
00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:10.306
[Tommy] Settle, settle, watch it...

673
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.350
It's all right, it's all right...

674

[grunting]

675
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.478
We don't mean no harm.

676
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:18.689
-We're just looking for our dad.
-[Ramon] Sí.


677
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:20.275
Is this your place?

[grunts]

679
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:23.069
Whose place is it?

[imitates baby cooing]

681
00:39:27.573 --> 00:39:28.741
Your mother?

682
00:39:28.824 --> 00:39:31.286
-[chuckles]
-Oh, is she here right now?

Oh, she's dead.

[speaks gibberish]

686
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:39.502
I'm so sorry,
I'm sure she was a good woman.

[grunts]

688
00:39:40.962 --> 00:39:42.213
She died three years ago?

[grunts]

690
00:39:43.423 --> 00:39:44.465
Three months ago?

00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:49.095
Oh, your mama has three nipples?

693
00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:50.305
[grunting] Huh?

694
00:39:53.183 --> 00:39:55.936
-Yeah, there's three of us.

Whoo-hoo!

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.904
You and your mom were making
moonshine up here, huh?


700
00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:07.655
[Tommy] Much obliged.

701
00:40:08.364 --> 00:40:09.365
Gracias.

702
00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:13.912
Making moonshine for Frank Stockburn?

703
00:40:13.995 --> 00:40:15.538
You know Frank Stockburn?

704

[grunts]

705
00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:19.792

00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:22.628

[grunting]

712
00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:39.270
[chuckles] Your mama was an owl.

713
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:42.607
No, our dad made his mom
make owl noises.


714
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.984
Huh?

715
00:40:44.067 --> 00:40:48.321
Yeah, that's right, friend.
We're your brothers.

[shrugging]

728

[Ramon] Herm, so you know,

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:34.075
our dad was kidnapped
by some bad muchachos.

[grunting]

734

No, we're only stealing the money
from folks what are bad.

Hmm...

[speaks gibberish]

737
00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:53.303

The Gold Nugget Saloon, huh?

742
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.774
I reckon you're coming with us?

You have no right to be here!
This Apache land!

And what you gonna do about it,
beaver breath?

How he know my name?

[laughing]

753
00:42:31.091 --> 00:42:33.801
Yeah, I think you also could have
gone with "Face Like Witch."


754
00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.553
Or "Eats Like Pig."

755
00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.347
Or "Hit In Face With Diarrhea Stick."

[laughing]

757
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.185
That's it? Nobody else?
Babyface? Stumbles?

00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:45.313
[Gus Patch laughing]
Hey, boss! Look what I got here!


759
00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:48.441
[laughs] He ain't gonna be
happy about this.


760
00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:51.694
Well, well, well.

761
00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:01.036
[Doc Griffin]
Yep, used to be a prosperous town.


762
00:43:01.121 --> 00:43:05.750
Then the gold mine dried up
and the train stopped stopping.


763
00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:09.337
The saloon's the only place left that
still does a good business.


764
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.716
Open day and night since they built it.
Ain't even a lock on the front door.


765
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.050
It never closes.

766
00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:19.389
They got a big ol' golden nugget
hanging above the fireplace.


767
00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:21.474
Folks come from all over
just to take a look.


768
00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:24.560
They say it's worth about $20,000, easy.

769
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.105
All right.

770
00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:31.317
[Lil Pete screaming]

771
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:35.196
I'm surprised no one's ever tried
to stolen that nugget.


772
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.072
-Oh, folks have tried.
-[Lil Pete yelping]


773
00:43:37.157 --> 00:43:40.368
If you go in there, you see their thumbs
hanging above the bar.


774
00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.537
Smiley Harris, the owner,
bit them clean off.


775
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.372
So nobody messes with Smiley.

776
00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:50.628
That sort of tickled.

777
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:53.423
What we got going over here, friend?

778
00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:55.758
Just open your robe, please.

779
00:43:57.968 --> 00:43:59.470
Ooh...

780
00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:02.265
I have never seen
that big of a rash...

781
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:04.058
or infection

782
00:44:04.142 --> 00:44:07.353
or whatever this green bubble is.

783
00:44:07.437 --> 00:44:08.938
Hmm. [chuckles]

784
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:10.105
All right.

785
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:13.651
Yeah.

786
00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:16.862
[gagging]

787
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.116
Now, son, I would simply recommend
that you stop doing


788
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:23.453
whatever it is you've been doing,

789
00:44:23.536 --> 00:44:25.705
with whoever...

790
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:28.291
or whatever you've been doing it with.

791
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:38.718
Yep, now they call him Smiley,

792
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:42.847
'cause even when committing
the most unspeakable atrocities,


793
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.975
a cheerful grin never leaves his face.

794
00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:50.187
All right, just lift your tail
for me, please.


795
00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:51.647
[splattering]

796
00:44:51.731 --> 00:44:53.858
Now, he's why that nugget
has never been stolen.


797
00:44:54.984 --> 00:44:56.902
And never will be stolen.

798
00:45:01.907 --> 00:45:03.784
This'll prevent infection.

799
00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:10.082
[laughs] It tastes good, too.

800
00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:15.421
This Smiley fella, sounds more like
a hooligan than a barkeep.


801
00:45:15.505 --> 00:45:16.756
You're not far off.

802
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:18.508
Rumor has it that
back in the old days

803
00:45:18.591 --> 00:45:20.635
he used to run

as well.

Where you going?
Nobody hit it.


1123
01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:16.037
I stole the base.
You weren't looking, so I stole it.


1124
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.248
You said you could only advance
after you hit the ball!


1125
01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.543
Not when you're stealing.

1126
01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:23.252
That's bullshit.

-Yes, and tie goes to the runner!

Why's that?

1134

Because those are the rules
of Stickie McSchnickens, that's why.

and then start the second half.

Mr. Doubleday, we're done.

1150
01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:49.172
But we've only played nine innings.

1151

Nine innings is enough.
Tell us about Dad's biggest score.

Fine.

1153
01:06:54.761 --> 01:07:01.142
Your father and his gang knocked off
an entire cavalry regiment, 120 men,

1159
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.781
Well, fellas,

1160
01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.868
looks like we're going to Sweet Hog Rock
to find ourselves a singing windmill.


1161
01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:20.662
But we still need another 10,000 bucks.

1162
01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:23.081
I reckon we'll make a quick stop, then.

1163
01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.916
Before you go...

1164

do you wanna line up and shake hands
and say "good game" to each other?


1165
01:07:28.587 --> 01:07:29.588
No.

1166

Kept the profanity to a minimum.


1168

And the Mexican brother knocked
this hard-ass' head off with a shovel?

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.592
What are you doing, man?
We gotta go! [gasps]


1273
01:13:09.928 --> 01:13:11.137
[chortles]

1274
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.639
-Oh, jackpot, boys!
-No!


1275
01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:14.765
-[Left-Eye Gang cheering]
-[gun clicks]


1276
01:13:14.848 --> 01:13:16.642
-That's ours!
-[Will Patch] Hyah!


1277
01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.729
-[horse whinnying]
-[Letf-Eye Gang whooping]


1278
01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:21.940
Rusty!

1279
01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.358
Rusty, no, come back!

1280
01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:25.484
[mouthing] No.

1281
01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.904
[birds chirping]

1282
01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.155
[eagle screeching]

1283
01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:41.417
How are we gonna save him?
We're startin' all over.


1284
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.836
Is there any more good places
we can rob?


1285
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.631
You know like a burro-grooming place
or a shoe store for burros?


1286
01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:51.052
Half the lawmen in the West
are already looking for us.


1287
01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:53.804
So what?
Look, we can't stop.


1288
01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:55.139
They're going to kill him!

1289
01:13:55.223 --> 01:13:57.600
Ain't no difference.
He's dying anyways.


1290
01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:03.314
Dad's sick.

1291
01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:06.109
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all.

1292
01:14:06.985 --> 01:14:09.445
There's a good chance
he's dead already.


1293
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:16.160
But there's a chance he's not.
You got to meet him, Tommy.


1294
01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:18.162
The rest of us...

1295
01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:20.748
Even if it was just for five minutes,
it'd be worth it.


1296
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:26.629
If I don't talk to Dad, I'll die with this
dirty secret burnin' a hole in my guts.


1297
01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:31.384
Danito, whatever it is you did,
you have to forgive yourself, man.


1298
01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.802
You wouldn't say that if you know
what I done.


1299
01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:36.347
-Everybody's got secrets, Danny.
-[Ramon] Yeah.


1300
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.807
You guys are the first people
I told I was black.


1301
01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:41.352
You know how good that made me feel?

1302
01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:43.521
We're your brothers.

1303
01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.606
You can tell us anything.

1304
01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:48.484
I, uh...

1305
01:14:50.278 --> 01:14:51.737
[sighs]

1306
01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.573
I used to work
for the President of the United States.


1307
01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.284
[grunts]

1308
01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:58.369
I was his personal bodyguard.

1309
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.621
One of the best.

1310
01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.416
Till one night...

1311
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.084
[indistinct talking]

1312
01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:11.715
Mr. President, say, I'm gonna go
hit the little boys' room.


1313
01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:14.052
Are you shitting me?

1314
01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:16.387
Come on!
You'll be fine, superstar.


1315
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:19.723
Can I get ya something on the way back?
Agua? Brewski?


1316
01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:20.933
No!

1317
01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:24.228
Mrs. Lincoln, how about one of them
big pretzels or a little pillow?


1318
01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:26.230
I hear this play's
kind of a long one.

1319
01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.858
All right, fair enough.
I'll be back in two.


1320
01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:36.907
[gasps]

1321
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:38.826
Where's the president's box?

1322
01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:41.537
-John Wilkes Booth, the actor?
-Yeah.


1323
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.373
No way, man! Big fan!

1324
01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:46.292
-You wanna say hi to the president?
-Yeah.


1325
01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:49.002
He'd get a real kick out of that.
Last door on the left.


1326
01:15:49.087 --> 01:15:51.089
-Thank you. [chuckles nervously]
-Really cool.


1327
01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:53.591
Wow! Love that guy!

1328
01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:59.012
-[gunshot]
-[woman screams]


1329
01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:03.101
[screaming] Abe!

1330
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.984
[sighs] How can you go on living your life
knowing you harmed so many people?


1331
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.902
That's what I wanna ask Dad.

1332
01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:17.365
Hey, you ain't the one
who pulled that trigger.


1333
01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:20.409
But if Dad's gotta be
the one who tells you that...


1334
01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.330
then let's go get that money.

1335
01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:26.915
I just wish I knew how.

1336
01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:30.461
[speaking gibberish]

1337
01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:31.795
Herm's got an idea.

1338
01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.089
[speaking gibberish]

1339
01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:34.590
He just can't express it.

1340
01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:38.302
I just wish somebody here
could speak Herm.


1341
01:16:39.052 --> 01:16:40.346
[chanting]

1342
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:47.270
[man] Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

1343
01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:51.899
That's when Ezekiel Grant has his annual
high-stakes poker game.


1344
01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:55.736
There'll be oodles of money there.
Oodles, I say.


1345
01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:57.280
Ooh.

1346
01:16:57.363 --> 01:17:00.366
-I don't know. That sounds risky.
-What's risky?


1347
01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:04.662
He's suggesting we...
knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.


1348
01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:05.996
-It's in Yuma tomorrow night.
-[speaks gibberish]


1349
01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:08.332
Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.

1350
01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:12.170
That poker game, there's practically
gonna be an army protectin' it.


1351
01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:16.424
If Tommy says we can beat 'em,
I'll believe him.


1352
01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:19.468
-We all will.
-[grunts]


1353
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.055
We can beat 'em...

1354
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.474
for Dad.

1355
01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:27.185
[all] For Dad!

1356
01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.269
[speaks gibberish]

1357
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.162
I hope you like the gift I'm giving you
for Valentine's Day, Ezekiel.


1358
01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:50.583
I'll give you a hint.
One-hour massage, no charge.


1359
01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.960
Oh, Susannah.

1360
01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:54.920
You know what gift I'd really love?

1361
01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.673
If you would just shut up!

1362
01:17:58.299 --> 01:18:01.093
Nothing ruins a good poker game more...

1363
01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:04.972
than a lady jabbering on and on...

1364
01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:07.266
-How romantic.
-[knocking on door]


1365
01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.102
[clears throat]

1366
01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.187
-Hello!
-Hello!


1367
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.647
Well, General Custer!

1368
01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:15.065
Yes, at your service.

1369
01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:16.692
Mr. Mark Twain.

1370
01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.819
-Word up!
-Gentlemen, do come in.


1371
01:18:18.902 --> 01:18:23.491
Yo, Zeke, big boy, I was just going off
to the General here about my new book.


1372
01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:25.784
-It's a sequel to Tom Sawyer.
-Ooh.


1373
01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:28.746
It's about Sawyer's home slice,
Huckleberry Finn.


1374
01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:32.666
White boy goes raftin' with a brother.
People gonna lose their shit!


1375
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.751
[all laughing]

1376
01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:38.088
And, General Custer, I see you've let
your dashing blond hair grow out.


1377
01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:41.342
Well, yes, the barber down at
the regiment is just awful,


1378
01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:45.095
so I had two choices,
either let it grow or get scalped.


1379
01:18:45.178 --> 01:18:47.890
-And I ain't gonna let that happen.
-[Mark and Ezekiel laughing]


1380
01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.851
Now, will our old friend
from Tombstone be joining us?


1381
01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:51.977
[Ezekiel] Late as usual.

1382
01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:57.441
But we have a new player,
a wealthy Mexican coffee bean rancher.


1383
01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:58.609
Am I tardy-o?

1384
01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:01.654
Oh. [laughing] Sneaky little Mexican.

1385
01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:05.115
May I present Don Don Diego.

1386
01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:07.910
[speaking Spanish]

1387
01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.704
We run a gentleman's game here, Mr. Diego.

1388
01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:14.333
Your, uh, two bodyguards
are completely unnecessary.


1389
01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.252
Bodyguards? [laughing]

1390
01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.879
[lisping] You're mistaken, General.

1391
01:19:18.962 --> 01:19:20.881
This is, um...

1392
01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:25.010
Chimichanga... my loyal manservant.

1393
01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:26.720
[speaking gibberish]

1394
01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:27.846
God bless you.

1395
01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.432
[Ramon] And, um...

1396
01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:33.143
Blanco Beardio.

1397
01:19:34.312 --> 01:19:37.273
He'll be providing the entertainment
for this afternoon's festivities.


1398
01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:38.857
Well, drop me a beat.

1399
01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:42.986
[piano playing]

1400
01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:45.864
Okay.

1401
01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:48.617
All right.

1402
01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:52.204
Here we go now.

1403
01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:58.752
[laughing]

1404
01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:02.172
Gentlemen, the buy-in is $15,000.

1405
01:20:02.255 --> 01:20:03.674
Fifteen large?

1406
01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:05.509
Are you sure General Custard
can swing that?


1407
01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:10.055
It's Custer, not "Custard."
There is no "D." I'm not a dessert.


1408
01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.975
Boom, I just dropped some satire
on your ass, General!


1409
01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.518
[all laughing]

1410
01:20:14.602 --> 01:20:15.644
You got me!

1411
01:20:17.187 --> 01:20:19.773
Hey! Now, when Ramon gives
the signal that the time is right,


1412
01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:21.274
that's when we move in.

1413
01:20:21.359 --> 01:20:22.818
You remember the signal, right?

1414
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:31.118
-[man] Gentlemen.
-You know where to go, Marshal.


1415
01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:33.161
Oh, hell, no!

1416
01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:35.080
That's Wyatt Earp!

1417
01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:37.500
The fastest gun in the West?

1418
01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:41.504
All right, all right, all right!

1419
01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:44.965
-Oh, Wyatt Earp, as I live and breathe!
-[whispers] Wyatt Earp.


1420
01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:46.759
[Ezekiel] You're here!
[General Custer] Wyatt Earp.


1421
01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.260
[Wyatt] Sorry I'm late, everybody.

1422
01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:52.556
But apparently, there's some new gang
out there robbing everybody blind.


1423

01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:08.343
If this is where the singing windmill is,
then why would they just up and leave?


1575
01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:11.847
Maybe that Stickie McSchnickens guy
was just pulling our leg.


1576
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:15.142
They went north...
about two hours ago.


1577
01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:16.434
Oh, yeah! Tommy can track 'em.

1578
01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.436
Let's saddle up.
We're burning daylight.


1579
01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.562
[Left
-Eye Boys] Wait!

1580
01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:22.107
[Will Patch] You can't just leave us here,
you gotta get us out!


1581
01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.650
-[snake rattling]
-You don't need to-- Hey, hey, hey!


1582
01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:24.902
We still got the money!

1583
01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:27.905
Yeah, I hid it in my pants.
[stuttering] We'll give it back to ya!


1584
01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:29.447
We don't need no more.
Let's go!


1585
01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.449
[Left
-Eye Boys shouting indistinctly]

1586
01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:34.077
Hey! Can you at least
help me pick these ants


1587
01:29:34.161 --> 01:29:36.788
out of my beard before you head out?

1588
01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:38.123
Please?

1589
01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.708
Tell you what,
we'll dig you up on one condition.


1590
01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.128
-[all exclaiming]
-You say it, we'll do it!


1591
01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.547
That you give up your lives of crime

1592
01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.926
and take this second chance to start
doing good by people.


1593
01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:51.386
-I'd rather die!
-Hell, no! I ain't doing that!


1594
01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.846
No way! Dumb Indian half!

1595
01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.141
That was a joke!
That was a joke!


1596
01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.518
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, Daddy!


1597
01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:08.946
[Ramon] Now what?
East or west?


1598
01:30:09.029 --> 01:30:10.113
[Tommy] Whoa.

1599
01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:24.627
Late in the day.

1600
01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:27.297
Lot of traffic been going through here.

1601
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:28.966
It's going to take a minute.

1602
01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:32.094
Well, we must be getting mighty close.

1603
01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:35.263
They'd better be treating Dad well,
or they're gonna have to answer to us.


1604
01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.099
There he is.

1605
01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:38.475
-There's the man himself.
-[Herm grunting]


1606
01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:40.435
-Look at that handsome hombre.
-[Danny] Yeah.


1607
01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:42.645
-That's where we get our good looks.
-[chuckling]


1608
01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:44.897
Let me see ol' Pop.

1609
01:30:57.494 --> 01:30:59.537
[Ramon] Does he still
look like that, Tommy?


1610
01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:01.706
Tommy?

1611
01:31:02.665 --> 01:31:04.167
Yeah, he does.

1612
01:31:05.335 --> 01:31:07.962
Let's set up camp tonight.
Right out there.


1613
01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.381
But we can't waste any time.

1614
01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:12.634
Chico... I can't figure it out right now.

1615
01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:13.885
I gotta...

1616
01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:15.970
Just give me till sunrise.
Let me think.


1617
01:31:20.017 --> 01:31:21.559
[snoring]

1618
01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:47.210
[Tommy] Dear brothers,

1619
01:31:47.294 --> 01:31:51.589
by the time you read this,
I will have caught up with Dad.


1620
01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:55.468
And I'm sure you're sore at me
for sneaking out on you.


1621
01:31:55.552 --> 01:32:01.308
But this fellow, Cicero, who took Pa,
also took my mother's life,


1622
01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:04.436
and I mean to
make him pay for that.

1623
01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:06.479
Things might get messy.

1624
01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:09.774
I can live
with all the bad stuff we've done,


1625
01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:15.322
the hold-ups, the burglaries,
the accidental decapitation,


1626
01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:19.784
but I couldn't live with myself
if something happened to one of you.


1627
01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:25.039
So stay put and I'll be back with Dad
as soon as I can.


1628
01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:26.999
And if I don't come back,

1629
01:32:27.084 --> 01:32:31.213
know that I love you boys
with all my heart.


1630
01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.798
Your brother, Tommy.

1631
01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:49.772
[Tommy] Whoa.

1632
01:32:58.865 --> 01:33:00.908
[Frank] Down at Silver Canyon...

1633
01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:03.453
Meeting Betty Dunson...

1634
01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:06.748
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.


1635
01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.960
Mom was his biggest score.

1636
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:13.630
Hyah.

1637
01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:22.722
[Cicero] Here we are.

1638
01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:25.099
We'd better not have come
all this way for nothing.


1639
01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:28.102
-I want the money, Frank.
-I know what you want.


1640
01:33:29.061 --> 01:33:30.855
[Tommy] There's your money.

1641
01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:32.106
Count it.

1642
01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:33.941
Tommy!

1643
01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:35.318
Oh, look who showed up.

1644
01:33:35.402 --> 01:33:38.821
I didn't know if somebody
dug up what you buried, Pa,


1645
01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:41.491
so I wanted to make sure
you were covered either way.


1646
01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:43.410
Thank you, son.

1647
01:33:43.493 --> 01:33:45.203
Well, ain't that a good boy.

1648
01:33:45.287 --> 01:33:46.913
That's my boy.

1649
01:33:46.996 --> 01:33:49.416
Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

1650
01:33:49.499 --> 01:33:51.251
But, uh...

1651
01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:52.585
we'll be on our way.

1652
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:54.421
Not so fast.

1653
01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:57.549
You and me got some unfinished business.

1654
01:33:57.632 --> 01:33:59.842
No, our business is done.

1655
01:33:59.926 --> 01:34:03.680
Pa... you remember how
I told you Ma died?

1656
01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:04.764
Yeah.

1657
01:34:04.847 --> 01:34:08.601
Well, the son of
a bitch who shot her...

1658
01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:10.812
had a tattoo on his hand...

1659
01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.024
just like Cicero here.

1660
01:34:15.942 --> 01:34:18.195
What, you mean...

1661
01:34:18.278 --> 01:34:19.987
my little horseshoe?

1662
01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.282
That's always brought me luck.

1663
01:34:22.865 --> 01:34:25.327
Especially when I was shooting somebody.

1664
01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:28.621
Well, killer, your luck just ran out.

1665
01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:32.334
Your hand touch that knife, boy,

1666
01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.794
it'll be the last thing you ever touch.

1667
01:34:34.877 --> 01:34:37.214
Oh, I ain't using these knives.

1668
01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:39.966
No.

1669
01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:42.260
Not for my mama.

1670
01:34:42.344 --> 01:34:46.514
I saved a special one just for you.

1671
01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:03.030
Now you die, Injun-lover.

1672
01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:08.119
He dies, you die.

1673
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:14.834
Fourteen of us, six of you.
Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?


1674
01:35:14.917 --> 01:35:17.254
Make that twelve of us.

1675
01:35:21.924 --> 01:35:22.925
[shouting] Twelve of us!

1676
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:29.807
I ain't sign up for this shit.

1677
01:35:57.544 --> 01:35:58.961
[grunting]

1678
01:36:02.465 --> 01:36:03.675
You seeing this?

1679
01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.385
-It's not working.
-What are you doing?


1680
01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:07.345
Don't look like a tumbleweed at all, Herm.

1681
01:36:07.429 --> 01:36:08.763
Herm, come back!
Come back, Herm.


1682
01:36:10.222 --> 01:36:13.017
All right, all right.
Now, everybody just calm down.


1683
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:17.229
A man's entitled...
to kill his mother's killer.


1684
01:36:17.314 --> 01:36:22.985
Plus... that's one less guy
you've got to split the money with!


1685
01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:25.822
Good thinking, Frank.
Let's ride!


1686
01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:28.157
[Gus Patch] Yeah!
[Will Patch] Yeah, get on out of here!


1687
01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.785
[Left
-Eye Boys shouting indistinctly]

1688
01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:34.956
Good job, son.
I'm really proud of you.


1689
01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:39.043
And getting your friends to come
all the way out here with you, brilliant.


1690
01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:44.090
Well, sir...
they ain't just my friends, they, uh...


1691
01:36:44.173 --> 01:36:45.216
They're my brothers.

[stutters]

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.391
Five?

1694
01:36:53.475 --> 01:36:55.560
You had fun, didn't you, sir?

1695
01:36:56.769 --> 01:36:58.062
[breathes heavily]

1696
01:36:58.145 --> 01:37:01.148
Well, I'm gonna introduce myself.

1697
01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:03.401
-I think they'd like that.
-[clears throat]


1698
01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:07.697
[Frank sighs]

1699
01:37:08.531 --> 01:37:12.159
Frank Stockburn, your dad.

1700
01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:17.289
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.


1701
01:37:17.374 --> 01:37:19.166
-Father.
-Son.

[both chuckle]

1703
01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:23.505
This is my burro.

1704
01:37:23.588 --> 01:37:25.590
Proud to know you, Burro.

1705
01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:28.801
He's proud.

1706
01:37:28.885 --> 01:37:32.221
You must be, uh,
Saint Louis, right?


1707
01:37:32.304 --> 01:37:33.556
Chico.

1708
01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.809
Boy, you got your mom's muscles.

1709
01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:37.977
[chuckles]

1710
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.479
You a prizefighter?

1711
01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:43.816
No, actually, I'm a...
piano player.


1712
01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.527
Oh, well, I'll be!

1713
01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:49.447
You know, I've been known
to tickle the ivories myself.


1714
01:37:49.531 --> 01:37:51.533
Now and then, you know.

1715
01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:53.868
We should play together sometime.
[chuckles]


1716
01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:57.622
I'd like that, Dad.

1717
01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.541
[voice breaking] I'd like that a lot.

1718
01:37:59.624 --> 01:38:01.208
Yeah, son, we'll do that.

1719
01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:03.545

fine whiskey.

Atta boy, atta boy.

1731
01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:41.458
[grunts] Da-da.

1732
01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:43.585
And, uh... you are?

1733
01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:47.505
I'm Lil Pete. I'm your son!
I love you so much, Dad!


1734
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:49.423
-I have three nipples.
-Yeah, well...


1735
01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.425
It's always good to have a spare.

1736
01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:53.219
[Lil Pete laughs]

1737
01:38:53.302 --> 01:38:55.722
-Gall dang, you have one, too?
-Yeah.


1738
01:38:55.805 --> 01:38:57.557
Do you like to
play with the extra one?

1739
01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.100
Oh, you betcha.

1740
01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:01.769
Oh, Pa, I have a question for you.

1741
01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:03.270
Yeah.

1742
01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:06.273
Where do babies come from?

1743
01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:09.986
Well, son, the mom just poops 'em out.

1744
01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:13.531
[laughing] I knewed it!
I knewed it, Dad!


1745
01:39:15.032 --> 01:39:17.326
Well, look at this handsome devil.

1746
01:39:17.409 --> 01:39:19.871
Sir, I'm Danny.

1747
01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:21.998
It's awful nice to finally meet ya.

1748
01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:24.626
Could you help me with a problem?

1749
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:26.669
I did a real stupid thing

1750
01:39:26.753 --> 01:39:31.340
that inadvertently led to the death
of a United States President,


1751
01:39:31.423 --> 01:39:35.469
and I'm feeling pretty lousy about it.

1752
01:39:37.138 --> 01:39:39.473
Well, son...

1753
01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:41.017
look in my eyes.

1754
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:45.187
Shit happens.

1755
01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.232
Yeah.

1756
01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.568
-Yeah, right.
-[both chuckling]


1757
01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:52.945
Thanks. Thank you, sir.

1758
01:39:53.029 --> 01:39:54.405
-[Frank] You're welcome.
-[exhales]


1759
01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:57.617
So, where to now, huh?

1760
01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:01.245
Well, sir, Smoking Fox and me
are getting married in a few days,


1761
01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:04.582
and Screaming Eagle's
walking her down the aisle,


1762
01:40:04.666 --> 01:40:07.835
and I was hoping...

1763
01:40:07.919 --> 01:40:10.296
you could be there, next to me.

1764
01:40:10.379 --> 01:40:13.090
Oh, you mean your best man?

1765
01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:14.592
Yes, sir.

1766
01:40:14.676 --> 01:40:16.468
Oh, Tommy...

1767
01:40:16.553 --> 01:40:19.180
You know, that's...
that's quite an honor.


1768
01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:21.808
-It would be my honor, sir.
-Yeah. Well, uh...


1769
01:40:23.392 --> 01:40:24.894
[clicks tongue]

1770
01:40:24.977 --> 01:40:27.980
But unfortunately, I...

1771
01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:31.442
I got some business up north
that I gotta attend to.


1772
01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:34.571
I gotta collect some gambling debts and...

1773
01:40:34.654 --> 01:40:38.365
You know,
just to pay the doctors and such.


1774
01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:41.911
Say, Dad. You don't ever gotta worry
about money ever again.


1775
01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:44.706
We had to conjure up 50 grand twice!

1776
01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:46.749
So we ended up with 100!

1777
01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:49.085
-A hundred?
-[Tommy] Yes, sir.


1778
01:40:49.168 --> 01:40:51.378
There's another 50 grand?

1779
01:40:51.462 --> 01:40:53.214
Yes, sir.

1780
01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:56.133
Right here,
in the burro's saddlebag.


1781
01:40:56.676 --> 01:41:01.347
So that business can wait up north,
can't it... best man?


1782
01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:07.228
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I should change my plans.


1783
01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:09.981
-Bueno. Bueno. [laughs]
-[Frank] Yeah. [whistles]


1784
01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:12.358
[men shouting indistinctly]

1785
01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:17.655
Hey! What are they doing back?

1786
01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:25.329
What is this?

1787
01:41:26.247 --> 01:41:29.000
I guess it's time you kids

1788
01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:33.713
learned the truth
about your dear old dad, huh?


1789
01:41:33.796 --> 01:41:37.258
I'm just too famous.

1790
01:41:37.341 --> 01:41:40.469
I can't walk into any town
west of the Rockies


1791
01:41:40.552 --> 01:41:43.305
without someone calling the law.

1792
01:41:43.389 --> 01:41:47.769
So, I came up with a way
we could make 50 grand


1793
01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:49.937
without lifting a finger. [chuckles]

1794
01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:53.900
And you rascals brought us double!

1795
01:41:53.983 --> 01:41:56.318
Are these my kids or what?

1796
01:41:56.402 --> 01:41:57.528
[laughing]

1797
01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:58.863
Son of a bitch!

1798
01:42:00.239 --> 01:42:02.825
If our two gangs joined forces,

1799
01:42:02.909 --> 01:42:06.829
there's not a lawman in the West
that would stand up against us.


1800
01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:09.666
What makes you think we'd turn
to a life of crime?


1801
01:42:09.749 --> 01:42:11.668
'Cause it's in your blood.

1802
01:42:11.751 --> 01:42:13.711
Answer me something.

1803
01:42:13.795 --> 01:42:19.341
Were you ever great at anything
in your life besides stealing?


1804
01:42:21.177 --> 01:42:22.720
No. No.

1805
01:42:22.804 --> 01:42:26.640
You apples didn't fall far from this tree.

1806
01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:29.060
Don't deny who you are.

1807
01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:31.813
If you knew who we really were,

1808
01:42:31.896 --> 01:42:34.523
you'd be very scared right now.

1809
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:39.737
Don't overplay your hand, son.

1810
01:42:41.322 --> 01:42:43.574
I'm still holding an ace.

1811
01:42:44.408 --> 01:42:45.409
[woman whimpering]

1812
01:42:52.959 --> 01:42:55.127
I found her. I--

1813
01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:56.670
I told you I'd find her.

1814
01:43:00.967 --> 01:43:05.471
This little beauty stumbled into our camp
a few days ago.


1815
01:43:06.305 --> 01:43:08.057
[chuckling]

1816
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.642
She actually tried to rescue me.

1817
01:43:10.727 --> 01:43:15.606
I'm guessing this means you don't want
me to be your best man no more, huh?


1818
01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:18.442
[all laughing]

1819
01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:21.570
Well, I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.


1820
01:43:22.864 --> 01:43:29.036
Hand over the other 50 grand...
in that stupid ass' saddlebag,


1821
01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:34.458
or I put a bullet
in her pretty Apache head.


1822
01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:38.629
That ain't gonna happen.

1823
01:43:39.338 --> 01:43:40.672
Oh, it ain't?

1824
01:43:40.757 --> 01:43:42.049
No, sir.

1825
01:43:43.009 --> 01:43:44.260
Why's that?

1826
01:43:44.343 --> 01:43:47.221
Mmm... kind of a secret.

1827
01:43:47.304 --> 01:43:51.392
Well, you can tell your old man,
can't ya?


1828
01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:52.810
[snickers]

1829

-your boy's holding?
-Uh-huh.


1831
01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:01.277
It was meant for Cicero.

1832
01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.363
So there's something special in there.

1833
01:44:04.446 --> 01:44:06.908
-Plan B.
-Plan B?


1834

[garbled] Plan B.

1835

You could have had everything, son.

1887
01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:28.109
But you had to do the right thing.

1888
01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:30.861
[Frank chuckling]

1889
01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:34.948
Let me leave you
with a bit of fatherly advice.


1890
01:47:36.242 --> 01:47:41.455
-Never bring a knife to a gunfight.
-[gun cocking]


1891
01:47:41.538 --> 01:47:44.541
[Tommy] One day,
there will be too many, my love.


1892
01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:45.834
[Smoking Fox] But not today.

1893
01:48:00.891 --> 01:48:03.519
That was some mystical shit.

1894
01:48:07.106 --> 01:48:08.815
[breathing heavily]

1895
01:48:08.899 --> 01:48:10.401
Tommy.

1896
01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:13.862
You knew Cicero killed my mother.

1897
01:48:13.945 --> 01:48:15.781
No!

1898
01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:17.199
No, I didn't know that.

1899
01:48:17.283 --> 01:48:18.909
No more lies!

1900
01:48:19.743 --> 01:48:22.121
Yeah, I knew. I knew.

1901
01:48:22.204 --> 01:48:24.123
Your mother insisted on telling.

1902
01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:27.626
She was going to rat the whole gang out,
and I tried to convince her--


1903
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:29.170
[stammers]

1904
01:48:29.253 --> 01:48:32.506
Tommy, look, I'm your father,
for God's sake.


1905
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:34.716
You don't kill your father, Tommy.

1906
01:48:40.889 --> 01:48:43.725
His name is White Knife.

1907
01:48:50.191 --> 01:48:52.234
I ain't gonna kill you.

1908
01:48:54.445 --> 01:48:58.199
'Cause my true father taught me otherwise.

1909
01:49:11.712 --> 01:49:13.755
You can't leave me like this!

1910
01:49:16.592 --> 01:49:17.718
Tommy!

1911
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:21.513
You can't leave me here alone!

1912
01:49:23.224 --> 01:49:25.226
[piano music playing]

1913
01:49:39.156 --> 01:49:40.699
[speaking gibberish]

1914
01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:58.925
[Lil Pete] Dear Mama, so much has changed
since my last letter.


1915
01:49:59.009 --> 01:50:00.927
I scarcely know where to begin.

1916
01:50:01.011 --> 01:50:06.225
First off, it turns out our daddy
is a bad, bad man,


1917
01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:08.519
and he got thrown in jail.

1918
01:50:08.602 --> 01:50:10.729
[all cheering]

1919
01:50:12.981 --> 01:50:17.944
But it's okay, 'cause Screaming Eagle,
the Indian chief who raised Tommy,


1920
01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:20.364
said he'd be all our dads, too.

1921
01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:31.041
I really like it here in this village.

1922
01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:34.711
Our new brothers and sisters
love to have fun


1923
01:50:34.795 --> 01:50:38.006
and have been so
nice to all of us.

1924
01:50:38.089 --> 01:50:41.177
These white guys cannot dance.

1925
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.261
[whooping]

1926
01:50:42.344 --> 01:50:44.346
[Lil Pete] Danny don't drink
whiskey no more.


1927
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:45.931
-No.
-[man] Yee-haw!


1928
01:50:46.682 --> 01:50:50.311
[Lil Pete] And Ramon and Herm
are trying to learn Indian ways.


1929
01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.692
[speaking Spanish]

1930
01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:01.738
[both screaming]

1931
01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:07.203
[Lil Pete] Oh, and big news...

1932
01:51:07.286 --> 01:51:09.455
I finally have a girlfriend,

1933
01:51:09.538 --> 01:51:12.749
and she's much prettier
than a canty-loupe.


1934
01:51:12.833 --> 01:51:15.377
Come on, you two!
You're missing all the fun.


1935
01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:19.590
Anyways, Mama, thanks for raising me.

1936
01:51:19.673 --> 01:51:22.926
Your loving son, Lil Pete,

1937
01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:27.055
proud member of the Ridiculous 6.

1938

[Western music playing]

1939
01:54:30.739 --> 01:54:32.741
[bluegrass music playing]

1940
01:58:51.582 --> 01:58:52.583
[Abner] Before you go...

1941
01:58:52.668 --> 01:58:55.712
Two, four, six, eight.

1942
01:58:55.796 --> 01:58:58.006
Who do we appreciate?

1943
01:58:58.089 --> 01:59:00.842
The Stockburns! 
The Stockburns!

1944
01:59:00.926 --> 01:59:03.511
Yeah! The Stockburns!
