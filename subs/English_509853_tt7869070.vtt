Pretzel Fang.

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:15.290
'Los Angeles.

3
00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:20.095
'I call it
the City of Bullshitters.


4
00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:30.706
'Who am I to judge?

5
00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.279
'I live here, too.

6
00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.987
'This place will suck
the life right out of you.


7
00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.023
'Some people pick themselves up

8
00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:51.627
'after getting the shit
knocked out of them.


9
00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:56.932
'Others break down
like an old station wagon.


10
00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:04.706
'We can try to put off
the inevitable...


11
00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:11.613
'but everything breaks down
eventually.

'he's unbreakable.'

15
00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.101
- Hey, Aaron.
- Chocolate Moose.


16
00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:09.538
I can't talk too long.
I got to poo.


17
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.073
Oh.

18
00:03:11.575 --> 00:03:13.942
So...

19
00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.244
- what's new with you?
- Nothing, just these thieves


20
00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:18.113
trying to take pictures
of my stuff.


21
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.816
See if they can get it cheaper
on eBay. It's brutal.


22
00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:22.384
You wanna know
what's new with me?


23
00:03:22.386 --> 00:03:25.020
You got Martin Sheen's autograph
on my "Badlands" poster?


24
00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:28.590
Nope. I'm going to a party
tonight with Hunter Dunbar.


25
00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:29.691
- Really?
- Yep.


26
00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:31.226
- Hunter Dunbar?
- Yep.


27
00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:32.194
How'd that happen?

28
00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:34.196
I got invited to
the cast and crew party


29
00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:36.798
- of "The Friday Night Killer".
- Huh!


30
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.268
Well, somebody's
moving up in the world.


31
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.737
Well, that's cool, but...

32
00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.438
I'm gonna have a lot
of Dunbar autographs myself


33
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.541
- after this weekend.
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?


34
00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:48.443
He's coming into the store.

35
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.680
You're the Moose.
You don't know this?


36
00:03:51.682 --> 00:03:53.081
What?

37
00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:56.184
He's signing copies
of his new book tomorrow night.


38
00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.986
- What?
- Here.


39
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.226
Ah.

40
00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:06.695
Why didn't you tell me
this was actually happening?


41
00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:08.797
It just came together.
What am I supposed to do?


42
00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.298
Call you on your moped?

43
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.667
Is he signing collectibles
or just the book?


44
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.170
No, just the book.
And you got to buy it here,


45
00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.038
and you got to have a receipt.
I'm checking.


46
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.774
I got some special things
at home,


47
00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:20.942
but I need something
super special.


48
00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:23.545
Well, you've had your mitts
on just about everything we got.


49
00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:26.581
We got those lobby cars, and
the Carver one, two, and four.


50
00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.183
Somebody fucking stole three.

51
00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:30.886
The British Quad
for "Ghost Train".


52
00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:36.191
You are such an idiot.
"Ghost Train" is so typical.


53
00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:39.828
I need something... I need...
I need something rememberable.


54
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.863
Is that a word, Moose?

55
00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:51.006
Well, this idiot still has...
this vest.


56
00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:56.011
That's "Space Vampires".

57
00:04:56.847 --> 00:04:58.947
- Is it still $800?
- Listen,


58
00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.384
it's never really been an item
in the Moose range.


59
00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:04.386
Yeah, but make it cheaper.
Look, you...


60
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:06.455
How many times do I come in here
to this store?


61
00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.291
How many times do I spend
my hard-earned money


62
00:05:09.293 --> 00:05:10.492
in that cash register?

63
00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:13.495
And how many times have we had
this exact discussion?


64
00:05:13.497 --> 00:05:16.431
I got $300, that's all I have.

65
00:05:17.634 --> 00:05:20.469
Please let me have the vest.
Please?


66
00:05:21.472 --> 00:05:22.804
Please?

67
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:27.442
I don't know why
it is so hard for me


68
00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:29.110
to say no to you, Moose.

69
00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:32.447
I want your $300,

70
00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.116
and I want you to pay it
by the end of this year.


71
00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:37.185
Yes, sir!

72
00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:40.922
I want you to have it.

73
00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.693
And don't forget it
tomorrow either.


74
00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:47.262
Oh, my God.

75
00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:50.832
Moose, that's stupid
putting it on backwards.


76
00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:53.301
I know.

77
00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:04.559
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Dunbar.


78
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:06.461
Come on, come on.

79
00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.363
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Dunbar.


80
00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:11.299
I have every one
of your VHS's and DVD's.


81
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.269
It's, like, everybody says that.
Say something sm...


82
00:09:14.271 --> 00:09:17.238
I don't... I'm...

83
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.307
Say something different.

84
00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.342
Say something...
No, I should tell him...


85
00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:23.611
Oh, oh, my God, he'll love this.

86
00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:26.414
You were really rad
in "Vampire Killers".


87
00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.582
Oh?

88
00:09:27.584 --> 00:09:31.186
You want me to call you
by your first name?


89
00:09:31.188 --> 00:09:34.422
Hi, Hunter.
This is a one and only shirt,


90
00:09:34.424 --> 00:09:36.825
but I could tell you where to...
get it,


91
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.761
but there won't be any there.

92
00:09:40.964 --> 00:09:45.433
He's gonna love me.
He's gonna love me!


93
00:09:47.137 --> 00:09:51.272
'I put some of the blame
on myself.


94
00:09:51.274 --> 00:09:54.576
'I just wanted to be
a good friend.'


95
00:10:03.887 --> 00:10:05.920
Hey, Moose. Sorry I'm late.

96
00:10:05.922 --> 00:10:07.555
What took you so long, Leah?

97
00:10:07.557 --> 00:10:10.024
I've been waiting here, like,

98
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.227
- I know.
- Seriously, I was gonna leave.


99
00:10:12.229 --> 00:10:14.562
Sorry. I'm sorry. OK?

100
00:10:14.564 --> 00:10:17.298
The party's just starting
to ramp up anyway.


101
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.434
Did you bring the cutters?

102
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.110
Scissors, dude?

103
00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:31.880
I said bolt cutters.

104
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:33.148
I don't know what they are.

105
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.483
Couldn't you just go
to a hardware store?


106
00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:38.319
I mean, Dunbar has to be worth
a trip to little Home Depot.


107
00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:41.189
He sure is. You think
he'll like my shirt?


108
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:42.757
This is, like,
my best horror shirt.


109
00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:47.729
- Do you think he'll like it?
- Yeah, he'll... he'll like it.


110
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.332
You know what? We're gonna
do this the old fashioned way.


111
00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:54.202
OK, you're gonna get up here.

112
00:10:57.307 --> 00:11:00.008
You're gonna put your foot
into my hand.


113
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.077
You're gonna reach high,
and then...


114
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.914
you'll pull yourself over, OK?

115
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.882
Alright.

116
00:11:07.884 --> 00:11:09.684
Up.

117
00:11:09.686 --> 00:11:11.619
One. Two. Three.

118
00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:16.624
Whoa, Nelly.

119
00:11:18.528 --> 00:11:21.496
It's ju...

120
00:11:22.566 --> 00:11:24.599
Oh, my God. Moose, are you OK?

121
00:11:25.569 --> 00:11:27.202
Am I alright?

122
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.271
I mean, you sound alright.

123
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.173
Is my shirt alright?

124
00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:34.075
I'm sure your shirt is fine.

125
00:11:34.077 --> 00:11:36.244
This is not a good idea!

126
00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:39.647
Just get Hunter Dunbar's
autograph and split, OK?


127
00:11:51.428 --> 00:11:53.995
Hey there. Can I get you
a drink, sir?


128
00:11:53.997 --> 00:11:56.598
- Hmm?
- Can I get you a drink?


129
00:11:58.168 --> 00:12:00.535
I'll just have
a strawberry milkshake


130
00:12:00.537 --> 00:12:02.136
with real ice cream, please.

131
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.239
Yeah, we don't...
we don't have milkshakes,


132
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:06.608
but I can make you a cocktail
or pour you a soda?


133
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.878
No, thanks. I just want a shake.

134
00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:13.314
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.


135
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.884
- Is Hunter Dunbar here tonight?
- Who?


136
00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:18.553
Hunter Dun...

137
00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:51.886
Excuse me, Amanda?
Excuse me, Amanda?


138
00:12:52.923 --> 00:12:54.822
Hi.

139
00:12:54.824 --> 00:12:56.291
How are you this evening?

140
00:12:56.293 --> 00:12:59.460
Um, I'm wonderful,
thank you. And you?


141
00:12:59.462 --> 00:13:01.796
I'm just fine.
Thank you for asking.


142
00:13:01.798 --> 00:13:05.300
- Mm-hmm.
- Your... Your movie is amazing,


143
00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:07.802
and you're going to be
amazing in it.


144
00:13:07.804 --> 00:13:11.339
- Thank you. That's so sweet.
- I love your shirt.


145
00:13:12.676 --> 00:13:14.409
It's the only one in the world.

146
00:13:19.249 --> 00:13:20.548
Hmm.

147
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.116
I'm a really big fan of yours,
Amanda.


148
00:13:22.118 --> 00:13:25.753
I really think your work
is solid and minutes into days,


149
00:13:25.755 --> 00:13:28.256
and I think you're really good
in "Kill or Be Killed".


150
00:13:28.258 --> 00:13:30.725
You should do more
horror pictures, Amanda.


151
00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.593
Yeah.

152
00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:34.429
You're a great Final Girl.

153
00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:36.731
You certainly know my work.

154
00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.366
Yeah.

155
00:13:38.368 --> 00:13:41.235
Do you know where
Hunter Dunbar is tonight?


156
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.671
Uh... Hunter? Well, you know,

157
00:13:43.673 --> 00:13:48.209
I believe Hunter is at his son's
elementary school play.


158
00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:50.111
You know,
all those kids must think


159
00:13:50.113 --> 00:13:53.381
that Hunter is some, sorta like,
real-life action hero.


160
00:13:53.383 --> 00:13:55.984
- Great!
- Oh!


161
00:13:55.986 --> 00:13:57.452
No outside bags allowed.

162
00:13:57.454 --> 00:14:00.221
I need... I need to get
an autograph from Amanda.


163
00:14:00.223 --> 00:14:02.490
Just let me have
one autograph, Amanda.


164
00:14:02.492 --> 00:14:03.925
That's enough, let's go.
Come on.


165
00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.461
No, don't... You... Don't
let him do this to me, Amanda.


166
00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:08.997
I'm a fan.
I'm her number one fan.


167
00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:10.565
Stop it! Stop it!

168
00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:13.134
Stop it! I came here
to see Hunter Dunbar.


169
00:14:13.136 --> 00:14:16.938
Leah! Leah! Leah!

170
00:14:26.716 --> 00:14:29.584
Who is it?

171
00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:31.986
Open the door!

172
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:35.590
I just wanted an autograph!

173
00:14:35.592 --> 00:14:38.626
Open the door, Moose!

174
00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.902
I put my neck on the line
for you,


175
00:14:47.904 --> 00:14:50.838
so that you could continue
with your freaky little hobby


176
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.907
collecting autographs
like a child,


177
00:14:52.909 --> 00:14:55.576
and this is how you repay me?
By acting like a maniac?


178
00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:58.646
"Maniac", that's a great movie.
Not the crappy remake.


179
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.915
That was overrated.
It's the new one I like.


180
00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:02.850
- Don't change the subject.
- It was, it...


181
00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:06.421
It was Amanda
who got me kicked out, Leah.


182
00:15:06.423 --> 00:15:08.356
She was the one being
a celebutard.


183
00:15:08.358 --> 00:15:09.957
Well, it doesn't matter,
Moose, OK?


184
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:12.660
Because I have to pay the rent,
and this camera is how I do it.


185
00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.062
If you can't respect that,

186
00:15:14.064 --> 00:15:16.064
then this is the last favor
I'm ever doing for you.


187
00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:18.533
Hunter Dunbar
wasn't even there last night.


188
00:15:18.535 --> 00:15:20.802
You promised that he'd be there.

189
00:15:21.938 --> 00:15:25.440
Do not... raise...
your voice at me.


190
00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:27.308
Not a good look, Moose.

191
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.078
I can do what I want.
You're not my mom.


192
00:15:55.171 --> 00:15:58.005
That was hysterical.

193
00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:08.015
Poppycock!

194
00:16:08.017 --> 00:16:10.485
Poppycock!

195
00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:32.406
Hello. Welcome
to Hol... Welcome to Hollywood.


196
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.142
Welcome to Hollywood...

197
00:16:34.144 --> 00:16:36.677
where dreams are made of.

198
00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:38.746
Place where dreams are made of.

199
00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.549
Where dreams are made...

200
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.320
London Bridge
is right over there.


201
00:16:46.322 --> 00:16:47.822
It's over...

202
00:16:47.824 --> 00:16:50.925
The Beatles are here!
The Beatles are here!


203
00:16:52.162 --> 00:16:55.062
- Hello, Tricy.
- 'Hello, Tracy.'


204
00:16:55.064 --> 00:16:56.464
Hello, Tricy.

205
00:16:56.466 --> 00:16:59.000
Jack the Ripper.
Jack the Ripper.


206
00:17:01.204 --> 00:17:02.637
What's up, LA?

207
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:06.274
I am the Boulevard's premiere
multimedia entertainer,


208
00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:09.277
and extreme performance artist
here to astonish you...


209
00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.279
and leave you breathless.
Alright?


210
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.781
Now, my name is Todd...

211
00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:17.485
but some folks, they call me
Todd the God. Alright?


212
00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:19.921
And I'm about
to blow your minds, alright?


213
00:17:19.923 --> 00:17:22.557
Now you all came to see
an amazing show, right?


214
00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:23.858
Yeah!

215
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.459
Alright, now
before I prove to you


216
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:28.129
that I am the most hardcore
illusionist on the Boulevard,


217
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:32.366
can I please get some brave soul
to test this nail for me


218
00:17:32.368 --> 00:17:34.569
to prove it's not a fake?

219
00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:37.672
Shh! Shh!

220
00:17:37.674 --> 00:17:40.474
Is that the "Quine"?

221
00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:45.246
You heard it hear, folks.
It's real... and it's hard.


222
00:17:45.248 --> 00:17:48.683
Alright.

223
00:18:05.134 --> 00:18:07.668
Oh, yeah! Ha-ha!

224
00:18:08.438 --> 00:18:10.204
Man, I love this shit!

225
00:18:10.206 --> 00:18:12.740
Whoo! Come on, come on,
get your money out.


226
00:18:12.742 --> 00:18:14.342
Right now.
Money in these buckets.


227
00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:16.744
Come on, look at this. Ah...

228
00:18:16.746 --> 00:18:20.081
There we go, keep 'em coming.
Keep 'em coming. Come on.


229
00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:22.850
This is one-of-a-kind
entertainment right here.


230
00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:26.354
Right on the streets of
Hollywood! Todd the God, baby!


231
00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.822
Whoo!

232
00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:30.625
- Man, is this really it?
- How about that, motherfucker?


233
00:18:30.627 --> 00:18:32.660
I'm doing all the fucking
dangerous work.


234
00:18:32.662 --> 00:18:35.496
- Fuck you, Slim!
- Oh, yeah? Huh?


235
00:18:35.498 --> 00:18:39.600
- Yeah, go fuck yourself.
- Good luck, you fucking pussy!


236
00:18:39.602 --> 00:18:41.636
- Fuck off!
- Piece of shit.


237
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.072
Fucking bullshi... Hey, Moose!

238
00:18:45.074 --> 00:18:47.775
Hey, man, why the wash?
Sorry about Slim's behavior.


239
00:18:47.777 --> 00:18:50.144
I got to go, Todd.
I'm meeting with Hunter Dunbar.


240
00:18:50.146 --> 00:18:53.247
- Hunter Dumbbell, huh?
- Hunter Dunbar!


241
00:18:53.249 --> 00:18:55.349
He happens to be the best actor
on the planet.


242
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:57.018
OK, well, why haven't you
introduced me, Moose?


243
00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.320
I don't even know him yet, Todd.

244
00:18:59.322 --> 00:19:02.189
We can do that later. Right now,
I got to proposition for you.


245
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:04.058
Slim and I, we just ended
our partnership,


246
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.727
and I want you to fill in
for him. Alright?


247
00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:08.996
- I don't want to.
- Look, it's easy, OK?


248
00:19:08.998 --> 00:19:11.732
I do all the hard work
hypnotizing the masses,


249
00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:13.301
you just need to pick
a couple pockets.


250
00:19:13.303 --> 00:19:15.102
I don't want to, Todd!

251
00:19:15.104 --> 00:19:18.773
You don't respect the Boulevard
and you don't respect the fans.


252
00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:21.742
- And I don't steal from people.
- People? People?


253
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:25.413
They're not people, Moose!
They're fucking tourists!


254
00:19:27.016 --> 00:19:30.117
- Moose, where you been?
- It's not over yet, is it?


255
00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:32.320
Relax, relax.
We've got to get you in line.


256
00:19:32.322 --> 00:19:35.723
- Have you got the vest?
- I sure do. Is he gonna sign?


257
00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:38.426
- Is he gonna sign?
- Moose, shh.


258
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.861
- Go right in.
- Yo, man, chill.


259
00:19:40.863 --> 00:19:42.863
- I'm sorry.
- What the hell?


260
00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:46.233
- I got Vis a Vis markers.
- Yeah, great. Cool.


261
00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:48.035
- You can use one if you want.
- Awesome.


262
00:19:48.037 --> 00:19:49.904
Who am I making this out to?

263
00:19:49.906 --> 00:19:53.274
- It's, uh, Alex.
- Alex. Alex.


264
00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.844
"To... Alex, best wishes..."

265
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.781
- There you go.
- Thanks.


266
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.397
Thank you.

267
00:20:49.399 --> 00:20:50.698
Thank you. Have a good day.

268
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.433
Thanks for coming by.

269
00:20:52.435 --> 00:20:55.703
Excuse me, Mr. Dunbar. There's
a woman named Brenda out back?


270
00:20:55.705 --> 00:20:57.805
She says she needs
to speak to you.


271
00:20:58.741 --> 00:21:00.674
Says it's important.
I don't know.


272
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.176
OK.

273
00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:05.346
- Alright.
- It's just out back over here.


274
00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.748
Excuse me.

275
00:21:08.718 --> 00:21:10.651
- Aaron, he's leaving.
- Oh, Moo...


276
00:21:10.653 --> 00:21:12.119
- Is he gonna sign?
- Moose...


277
00:21:12.121 --> 00:21:14.121
- Aaron, he's leaving.
- Moose, it's OK.


278
00:21:14.123 --> 00:21:17.057
- Is he gonna sign?
- Moose, he's gonna sign.


279
00:21:17.059 --> 00:21:20.761
Oh.

280
00:21:26.803 --> 00:21:28.235
Hey, buddy.

281
00:21:32.108 --> 00:21:33.441
What the hell you doing here?

282
00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:36.143
Maybe you could remember
that I have date tonight.


283
00:21:36.145 --> 00:21:37.978
You said you'd watch Tanner.

284
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.080
- Tonight?
- Mr. Dunbar?


285
00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:41.482
- Look, I messed up.
- Mr. Dunbar.


286
00:21:41.484 --> 00:21:44.785
I was the next fan in line.
I think you forgot.


287
00:21:44.787 --> 00:21:46.921
Just... just take it easy,
buddy. Take it easy.


288
00:21:46.923 --> 00:21:48.722
- I sure will.
- Just give me a minute, OK?


289
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:51.792
I sure will.
Thank you, Mr. Dunbar.


290
00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:56.430
You thought it was OK
to bring him here?


291
00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:58.399
It's not OK.

292
00:21:59.836 --> 00:22:01.769
OK, alright. OK. OK.

293
00:22:01.771 --> 00:22:04.371
I'm... I'm sorry. I fucked up.

294
00:22:04.373 --> 00:22:06.207
Yeah.

295
00:22:06.209 --> 00:22:08.342
Clearly this means a lot to you.

296
00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:10.511
Clearly.

297
00:22:10.513 --> 00:22:12.012
You know what I'm gonna do?

298
00:22:12.014 --> 00:22:13.781
Tomorrow I'm gonna call you

299
00:22:13.783 --> 00:22:17.818
and you can unload whatever
it is you want to unload on me.


300
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.388
Get it all off your chest, OK?

301
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:26.193
You're so full of shit, Hunter.

302
00:22:27.063 --> 00:22:29.029
But you're a great actor.

303
00:22:29.031 --> 00:22:31.732
You got thirty minutes.

304
00:22:31.734 --> 00:22:33.534
Fuck!

305
00:22:35.671 --> 00:22:37.271
I'm on your side.

306
00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:40.241
You're the best, Mr. Dunbar.
You're the best.


307
00:22:40.243 --> 00:22:42.510
You need to learn
some fucking manners, buddy.


308
00:22:42.512 --> 00:22:43.911
I'm sorry, Mr. 
Dunbar, but...

309
00:22:43.913 --> 00:22:46.113
I have every VHS,
I have every DVD.


310
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:48.082
You're so rad in "Warriors",

311
00:22:48.084 --> 00:22:50.117
I just don't want you
not to sign my stuff.


312
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:51.886
You came to the place,
but I'm officially done.


313
00:22:51.888 --> 00:22:54.121
But wait till you see
the special items I have.


314
00:22:54.123 --> 00:22:56.223
This is "Space Vampires".

315
00:22:57.894 --> 00:23:00.528
How about I sign your face
with my fucking fists?


316
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.330
That's a collector's item you're
not gonna want to take home.


317
00:23:03.332 --> 00:23:05.165
Trust me.

318
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.301
Yes, sir.

319
00:23:15.044 --> 00:23:16.777
Can I ask you a question?

320
00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:18.145
Mm-hmm.

321
00:23:18.147 --> 00:23:21.448
How do you guys
find celebrity houses?


322
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.617
How do you find them?

323
00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:25.286
Why do you ask?

324
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.222
Well, is it difficult?

325
00:23:28.224 --> 00:23:30.591
Is it difficult to find
famous people's houses?


326
00:23:30.593 --> 00:23:34.762
Well, uh... Well, I mean,
sometimes it can be tricky,


327
00:23:34.764 --> 00:23:37.631
but we have our ways.

328
00:23:37.633 --> 00:23:40.100
Do you think that...
that it would be difficult


329
00:23:40.102 --> 00:23:41.535
to find Hunter Dunbar's house?

330
00:23:41.537 --> 00:23:44.171
I can't think of one good reason

331
00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:47.207
why you, of all people should
know where Hunter Dunbar lives.


332
00:23:47.209 --> 00:23:50.444
I just... I wanna see
how successful he is.


333
00:23:52.181 --> 00:23:53.681
OK. Cool.

334
00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:57.451
Um... well, if I want to get
a really embarrassing shot


335
00:23:57.453 --> 00:24:00.821
of some hung-over celebutard
in his bathrobe


336
00:24:00.823 --> 00:24:02.156
at some other celebutard's
house,


337
00:24:02.158 --> 00:24:04.992
I use my handy dandy
Star Map app.


338
00:24:04.994 --> 00:24:07.194
- Star Map app?
- Yeah.


339
00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:09.697
It is...

340
00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:11.665
right there.

341
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:13.334
Holy cow, Batman.

342
00:24:13.336 --> 00:24:15.536
- Pretty cool, right?
- Is this for real?


343
00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:19.206
Yeah. Well, sometimes, I mean,
if the address is wrong


344
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:20.808
you'll still see a celebrity,

345
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.543
because, I mean,
they all live up there.


346
00:24:22.545 --> 00:24:25.446
So either way,
cha-ching for me, you know?


347
00:24:26.449 --> 00:24:27.948
Ah.

348
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:31.819
OK. I'm downloading.

349
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:33.921
Wait, Moose. You...

350
00:24:33.923 --> 00:24:36.023
You have to promise me, OK?

351
00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:37.458
You have to be careful.

352
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.260
I don't want you to be accused
of stalking.


353
00:24:40.262 --> 00:24:43.297
That's hilarious.

354
00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:47.768
- I'm not an idiot.
- No. I know you're not.


355
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.903
Alright. You can have one.

356
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.472
- One?
- Yup.


357
00:24:51.474 --> 00:24:53.540
Thanks.

358
00:24:55.111 --> 00:24:56.610
I love you, Moosey.

359
00:24:58.648 --> 00:25:01.115
I love you.

360
00:25:02.852 --> 00:25:06.086
Leah, pick up, pick up,
pick up. Pick up!


361
00:25:13.396 --> 00:25:15.829
- Hello?
- 'Leah! I got to thank you.'


362
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:17.998
Thank you, thank you, so much.

363
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.067
'OK, calm down.
Thank me for what?'


364
00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:22.469
The Star Map app. It's awesome!

365
00:25:22.471 --> 00:25:24.772
It's so awesome.
Ben Affleck's house.


366
00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:27.241
'I saw his house. It's so big.

367
00:25:27.243 --> 00:25:29.443
'Did you know he has two pools?'

368
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:33.180
And James Franco
lives 15 minutes away from me.


369
00:25:33.182 --> 00:25:35.616
Fifteen minutes.
He's practically my neighbor.


370
00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:40.054
And Jaime Lee Curtis, her bar
is so big. It's so big, Leah.


371
00:25:40.056 --> 00:25:41.889
OK, Moose.

372
00:25:41.891 --> 00:25:43.724
Just remember what I said, OK?

373
00:25:43.726 --> 00:25:46.393
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Please don't worry.


374
00:25:46.395 --> 00:25:49.663
OK, Moosey out.
I got to go. I got to go.


375
00:25:58.541 --> 00:26:00.407
'Dear Mr. Dunbar,

376

I really care about you.

Book and Poster Shop.

I wanted to do.'

'I even spent all my money
to buy your vest.'


386
00:26:42.151 --> 00:26:46.286
Oh, yeah. I'll draw
a picture of... the vest.


387

'Please take more time

'P.S. Will you please

Hey.

401
00:28:00.196 --> 00:28:02.396
Can I help you?

402
00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:10.103
Hey, Danny. Why don't you go
inside the house for a second


403
00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.872
and fire up the Xbox, alright?

404
00:28:11.874 --> 00:28:14.174
I'll be in in a minute.

405
00:28:17.012 --> 00:28:19.847
Hi, Danny. Hi, Danny.

406
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:37.764
I don't know what
you're doing outside my house


407
00:28:37.766 --> 00:28:41.735
like some deaf, mute pervert,
but I suggest you keep moving.


408
00:28:41.737 --> 00:28:44.571
Unless you want trouble.

409
00:28:44.573 --> 00:28:48.275
- You want trouble?
- I sure don't. I sure don't.


410
00:28:48.277 --> 00:28:50.544
Here's a letter for you.

411
00:28:50.546 --> 00:28:53.146
- It's a letter.
- You wrote a letter?


412
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:54.948
I don't accept letters here.

413
00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.421
Listen, pal,
I don't know how you found me,


414
00:29:01.423 --> 00:29:04.191
but I don't ever want to see you
in this neighborhood again.


415
00:29:04.193 --> 00:29:05.626
OK? You understand?

416
00:29:05.628 --> 00:29:07.527
I just want your autograph,
Mr. Dunbar.


417
00:29:07.529 --> 00:29:10.230
I collect autographs.
And I bought your...


418
00:29:10.232 --> 00:29:12.799
I bought your vest
from "Vampire Killers".


419
00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:16.470
It was $300. See?

420
00:29:16.472 --> 00:29:18.572
What, are you some sorta
freak autograph hound


421
00:29:18.574 --> 00:29:20.841
that won't leave me
the fuck alone?


422
00:29:20.843 --> 00:29:23.110
You can't just come
to my private residence


423
00:29:23.112 --> 00:29:25.212
looking for me.

424
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.184
You want my autograph?

425
00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:32.819
Give me the pen.

426
00:29:34.723 --> 00:29:35.856
Thank you.

427
00:29:36.458 --> 00:29:38.592
I got your autograph.

428
00:29:38.594 --> 00:29:41.194
Right there...

429
00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:45.432
Is my autograph.

430
00:29:46.902 --> 00:29:49.403
Now get the fuck out of here.

431
00:30:12.094 --> 00:30:16.563
'They say you should
never meet your heroes.


432
00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:19.566
'But meeting them's
not the problem.


433

'It's when you get too close.

434

'Close enough to see
what's behind the mask.

'That's a line
they don't want you to cross.'


436
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:11.785
'Ello, little boy.

437
00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:14.521
You want to take
a photograph with me?

00:31:14.523 --> 00:31:17.357
- '...my mate Dave.'
- Did you see my mate Dave?


439
00:31:17.359 --> 00:31:18.825
'No worries.'

440
00:31:18.827 --> 00:31:20.560
I'm not really from London,
you know?


441
00:31:20.562 --> 00:31:23.463
A lot of people think
I'm from London.


442
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:24.698
But I'm not.

443
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.967
Come on!

444
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:32.539
- You seem to know your stuff.
- I sure do. I sure do.


445
00:31:32.541 --> 00:31:34.408
But not like that Todd guy.

446
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.077
He's not a God.
He's full of doo-doo.


447
00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:42.916
He doesn't respect Hollywood.
I... I respect Hollywood. Yeah.


448
00:31:42.918 --> 00:31:45.619
Alright, true love?

449
00:31:47.222 --> 00:31:50.057
You're
really good. You're really good.


450
00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:52.492
You're so good. 
Let me just...

451
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.401
Don't forget to see the
Wax Museum before you go home.


452
00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:08.275
Ah! 'Sup, fucking gaylord?

453
00:32:08.277 --> 00:32:11.378
Hey, hey, oh, oh.
Don't arrest me, Officer.


454
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.013
It wasn't me. No, I swear.

455
00:32:13.015 --> 00:32:15.315
I swear I didn't even know
she was still in high school.


456
00:32:15.317 --> 00:32:16.583
He didn't.

457
00:32:16.585 --> 00:32:18.518
Ah, what you doing here,
Moose, huh?


458
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.420
Did you make some serious money?

459
00:32:20.422 --> 00:32:23.156
- No, it was pretty slow.
- Oh, slow, huh?


460
00:32:23.158 --> 00:32:24.925
You call that slow? See?

461
00:32:24.927 --> 00:32:26.726
I... I call that ball.

462
00:32:26.728 --> 00:32:28.562
A little fake blood.
A little movie magic.


463
00:32:28.564 --> 00:32:29.996
You like movies,
don't you, Moose?


464
00:32:29.998 --> 00:32:32.566
That's what's up.
Come on, dude. Let's celebrate.


465
00:32:32.568 --> 00:32:34.501
You do the honors, Slim.
You fucking earned it today.


466
00:32:34.503 --> 00:32:36.870
You know, I think
he should do the honors.


467
00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:39.606
Would you like
to do these honors?


468
00:32:39.608 --> 00:32:43.210
- I think he fuckin' would!
- Yeah, suck it, huh?


469
00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:47.080
Oh, man!

470
00:32:47.082 --> 00:32:50.650
Yo, when I'm high, it's like the
money rains from the heavens,


471
00:32:50.652 --> 00:32:52.819
right into my pocket.

472
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:54.454
Then why do you steal
from people?


473
00:32:54.456 --> 00:32:57.691
- Why do you steal from people?
- Whoa, whoa, what'd you say?


474
00:32:57.693 --> 00:32:59.459
Something about stealing?

475
00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:00.694
You didn't say nothing.

476
00:33:00.696 --> 00:33:02.395
And that's the way
you're gonna keep it.


477
00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:04.531
Give the guy a break.

478
00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:07.868
He's working his ass off
out there, do righty. Just...


479
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.871
He just does it a little bit
different than we do.


480
00:33:10.873 --> 00:33:13.707
- Everything OK in here?
- Yeah.


481
00:33:13.709 --> 00:33:15.642
We're just talking about
the Dodgers, Dick.


482
00:33:15.644 --> 00:33:18.678
Why can't you
leave this guy alone, huh?


483
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.047
Now get out of here,
you degenerates.


484
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:23.850
Bye-bye, Moosey.

485
00:33:23.852 --> 00:33:26.920
Keepin' two eyes on you, Moose.

486
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:30.190
That's not very nice, Dick.

487
00:33:30.192 --> 00:33:32.526
OK?

488
00:33:34.997 --> 00:33:37.697
Why are you letting those freaks
push you around like that?


489
00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:39.232
They're just playing.

490
00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:40.867
You're a good guy, Moose!

491
00:33:40.869 --> 00:33:43.069
You shouldn't be messing around
with those fools.


492
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:44.905
They're just playing.

493
00:33:44.907 --> 00:33:47.707
You can't let people
keep shitting on you.


494
00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:49.376
One day,
you're gonna need to learn


495
00:33:49.378 --> 00:33:51.144
how to stand up for yourself.

496
00:33:51.146 --> 00:33:54.214
You're gonna have to learn
how to fight back.


497
00:33:54.216 --> 00:33:56.783
OK?

498
00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:57.984
I'm late.

499
00:33:57.986 --> 00:34:00.086
I've got to go.

500
00:34:06.228 --> 00:34:07.761
'I have no idea

501
00:34:07.763 --> 00:34:11.531
'why Moose would go back
to that man's house.


502
00:34:12.701 --> 00:34:16.002
But I suppose
when you find the cookie jar...


503
00:34:17.339 --> 00:34:20.173
it's hard to not go back
for more.


504
00:35:03.318 --> 00:35:05.986
I did it. I did it.

505
00:35:21.103 --> 00:35:23.570
Why would Hunter Dunbar
let this die?


506
00:35:23.572 --> 00:35:26.172
Hey!

507
00:35:27.376 --> 00:35:29.042
Get out!

508
00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:31.645
Get out of here!

509
00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:56.102
What are you doing? You trying
to give me a heart attack?


510
00:35:56.104 --> 00:35:57.904
Of course not.

511
00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:00.173
You can't just sneak up
on people like that, Moose.


512
00:36:00.175 --> 00:36:02.842
I almost had a shot of Conrad
Hall walking outta Earth Bar.


513
00:36:02.844 --> 00:36:05.312
Earth Bar sucks - no milkshakes.

514
00:36:05.314 --> 00:36:08.148
Yeah, well, your best friend
Hunter Dunbar's co-star,


515
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.216
Ms. Title,
walked out of there earlier


516
00:36:10.218 --> 00:36:13.720
and blessed me with
a see-through blouse, no bra.


517
00:36:13.722 --> 00:36:16.289
It's funny
that you mention Dunbar.


518
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:19.059
Because I was just at his house.

519
00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:21.428
- You're kidding, right?
- Nope.


520
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.830
I used the Star Map app,
the one that you told me about.


521
00:36:23.832 --> 00:36:26.833
Takes you directly
to his house. And...


522
00:36:26.835 --> 00:36:29.669
His plants, he should take
better care of his plants.


523
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:32.672
I did not tell you
to use the Star Map app.


524
00:36:32.674 --> 00:36:34.808
- You sure did.
- No, I did not.


525
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.343
I told you about the app

526
00:36:36.345 --> 00:36:38.411
because you are the biggest
movie fan I know, and I thought


527
00:36:38.413 --> 00:36:40.213
you'd get a kick out of seeing
where the stars live.


528
00:36:40.215 --> 00:36:42.415
You cannot just invade
people's privacy.


529
00:36:42.417 --> 00:36:44.317
I'm not in trouble, Leah.

530
00:36:44.319 --> 00:36:47.721
I just dropped a letter off
at his house, that was it.


531
00:36:47.723 --> 00:36:49.289
Moose, this is really bad.

532
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:51.758
I can't believe
you're acting like this.


533
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.560
I thought you'd be happy for me.

534
00:36:53.562 --> 00:36:55.462
Happy for you?

535
00:36:55.464 --> 00:36:57.163
I would have never
encouraged you


536
00:36:57.165 --> 00:36:59.199
if I knew you'd turn into
a creepy little stalker.


537
00:36:59.201 --> 00:37:04.204
I am not a stalker.
I am a fan, Leah!


538
00:37:04.206 --> 00:37:07.040
You should know
that better than anybody.


539
00:37:07.042 --> 00:37:10.076
You're being so mean.
Like Hunter's wife.


540
00:37:10.579 --> 00:37:12.746
Moose!

541
00:37:14.549 --> 00:37:18.251
She is not my BBF. She is not.

542
00:37:22.224 --> 00:37:24.023
Moose! Oh, come on...

543
00:37:24.025 --> 00:37:26.659
Hey, hey. My man! We on
for tonight's show or what?


544
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:28.495
We are gonna be making
mucho Donald Trump.


545
00:37:28.497 --> 00:37:30.764
- Leave me alone, Todd.
- You're not gonna make paper


546
00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:32.966
in that bullshit bobby cop
outfit, alright?


547
00:37:32.968 --> 00:37:35.368
If you really need money,
I can make you money, alright?


548
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.605
Give you what you need, easy.
I go on in 15. Alright?


549
00:37:38.607 --> 00:37:40.173
I can teach you how to hustle.

550
00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:42.842
And I really... I need the cash,
Moose, in a bad way.


551
00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:45.545
Yeah, to buy drugs?
To buy drugs? To buy drugs?


552
00:37:45.547 --> 00:37:49.149
- What does it matter to you?
- I'm not doing it, Todd!


553
00:37:49.151 --> 00:37:51.785
Just leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.


554
00:37:51.787 --> 00:37:54.754
Just leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.


555
00:37:54.756 --> 00:37:56.222
Fucking pussy!

556
00:37:56.224 --> 00:37:58.358
You don't have the balls
to get what you want.


557
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.027
Alright? I got an amazing
business opportunity here


558
00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:03.596
staring you right
in the face, you know that?


559
00:38:03.598 --> 00:38:05.231
I'm done playing nice. Alright?

560
00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:08.902
You're gonna help me make
some fucking cash, bitch.


561
00:38:10.472 --> 00:38:16.509
I wish Freddy Krueger would come
and chop off your head.


562
00:38:16.511 --> 00:38:21.147
And it would roll in the street
and a truck would squish it


563
00:38:21.149 --> 00:38:24.417
and the blood would splatter
everywhere.


564
00:38:24.419 --> 00:38:27.587
And everyone would watch it!

565
00:38:35.464 --> 00:38:38.164
You're not worth it anyway.

566
00:38:38.166 --> 00:38:39.365
Moose!

567
00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:43.169
Will I get in trouble?
Am I in trouble?


568
00:38:43.171 --> 00:38:45.905
Are you kidding me?
I'm proud of you.


569
00:38:45.907 --> 00:38:47.407
- You're proud of me?
- Yes.


570
00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:49.409
- You're proud of me?
- You did good.


571
00:38:49.411 --> 00:38:52.712
People have to just stop
calling me a stalker.


572
00:38:52.714 --> 00:38:53.847
Stalker?

573
00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:56.349
They have to stop
calling me a loser.


574
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:59.352
Because I...

575
00:38:59.354 --> 00:39:01.287
Even my friends
are calling me that.


576
00:39:01.289 --> 00:39:04.891
NEWSFLASH, MOOSE:
Todd is not your friend, man.


577
00:39:04.893 --> 00:39:09.863
I know, but people
have to stop picking on me.


578
00:39:09.865 --> 00:39:11.998
I'm gonna make them stop.

579
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.901
I'm gonna make them stop.

580
00:39:23.545 --> 00:39:24.744
Mr. Dunbar.

581
00:39:24.746 --> 00:39:27.213
I need to talk to you
about something.


582
00:39:27.215 --> 00:39:29.115
This afternoon,
while you were out,


583
00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:31.918
some crazy man
ran into your backyard.


584
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.853
What are you talking about?

585
00:39:33.855 --> 00:39:36.055
I had to scare him away.

586
00:39:36.591 --> 00:39:38.057
Yeah, well...

587
00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:40.727
you sure this crazy man
wasn't the gardener?


588
00:39:40.729 --> 00:39:43.129
No, this was something
different.


589
00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:46.065
Well, whatever you did,
it worked.


590
00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:55.775
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here.


591
00:39:55.777 --> 00:40:00.213
- You alright?
- I was so scared.


592
00:40:00.882 --> 00:40:03.449
Jesus, you're shaking.

593
00:40:03.919 --> 00:40:05.919
You OK?

594
00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:13.593
Yeah.

595
00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:21.634
I'm sorry. I shouldn't.

596
00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:25.805
I'm sorry, that was...
That's my fault.


597
00:40:25.807 --> 00:40:28.374
- I apologize.
- It's OK.


598
00:40:28.376 --> 00:40:33.313
It's just... I don't think
we can do that anymore.


599
00:40:33.315 --> 00:40:35.548
OK. OK.

600
00:40:40.722 --> 00:40:41.821
Dora?

601
00:40:41.823 --> 00:40:44.557
Yeah?

602
00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:47.660
You, uh, you're really doing
a great job around here.


603
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.264
Feels like a home again.
Thank you.


604
00:40:51.266 --> 00:40:53.299
Mm-hmm.

605
00:40:55.604 --> 00:40:57.370
Shit!

606
00:41:00.475 --> 00:41:03.276
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Ah.


607
00:41:03.278 --> 00:41:05.044
You got to listen to me
when I talk to you.


608
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:08.214
Sorry, señor. I was just
listening to my music.


609
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:11.250
Dora said she saw somebody
sneak into the yard today.


610
00:41:11.252 --> 00:41:14.320
She's concerned, which, you
know, makes me very concerned.


611
00:41:14.322 --> 00:41:17.090
Did you see someone strange
in the yard today?


612
00:41:17.092 --> 00:41:20.159
No, no, señor.
I just focus on work, is all.


613
00:41:20.161 --> 00:41:21.761
- Alright.
- Just work, eh?


614
00:41:21.763 --> 00:41:23.529
OK. Look, do me a favor.

615
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:26.199
You see somebody strange
in the yard you let me know, OK?


616
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:27.500
- Sí, sí, sí, sí.
- Alright?


617
00:41:27.502 --> 00:41:30.570
Señor Hunter, it's raining out,
I cannot finish.


618
00:41:30.572 --> 00:41:32.472
Uh, maybe I go home?

619
00:41:32.474 --> 00:41:36.309
- Yeah. Yeah, go home.
- Gracias.


620
00:41:41.016 --> 00:41:44.450
Alright. Come on, we're late.

621
00:41:44.452 --> 00:41:46.452
You gonna score me
some goals today, or what?


622
00:41:46.454 --> 00:41:48.721
- Yeah.
- Alright. Get in. Get in...


623
00:42:22.157 --> 00:42:24.157
No, don't read it!

624
00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:27.593
Don't read it! Don't read it!
Don't read it!


625
00:42:27.996 --> 00:42:29.696
Ow!

626
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.766
Help! Help! Help!

627
00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:35.635
I'm just a fan. I'm just...

628
00:42:35.637 --> 00:42:37.637
- Ayuda, ayuda!
- Just stop hitting me!


629
00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:39.706
- Ayuda!
- Be quiet!


630
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:45.778
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

631
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.314
Are you OK?

632
00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:52.185
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

633
00:42:52.187 --> 00:42:54.187
That's a nosebleed.

634
00:42:54.189 --> 00:42:56.389
That... That's bad. That's bad.

635
00:42:56.391 --> 00:42:59.892
I had a nosebleed.
It wasn't fun.


636
00:42:59.894 --> 00:43:02.195
But you... you fix it.

637
00:43:02.197 --> 00:43:05.565
You take paper towels
and you put it up your nose...


638
00:43:37.832 --> 00:43:40.032
No laser.

639
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:42.201
No alarm.

640
00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:50.543
I'm... in... Hunter...
Dunbar's... house!


641
00:43:53.782 --> 00:43:56.282
"Best Monster Makeup."

642
00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:00.186
"Best Stunt."

643
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.660
Moose is in the house.

644
00:44:07.662 --> 00:44:09.095
Moose is in the house.

645
00:44:09.097 --> 00:44:11.864
Watch out. Watch out!

646
00:44:11.866 --> 00:44:13.733
Here's... Moosey.

647
00:44:24.813 --> 00:44:26.879
Poor Danny.

648
00:44:26.881 --> 00:44:29.715
All that money, no ice cream.

649
00:44:47.402 --> 00:44:50.736
This is not a good script.

650
00:44:50.738 --> 00:44:53.472
He should not do it.

651
00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.913
"Two for sleep."

652
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.550
"One for insomnia."

653
00:45:06.054 --> 00:45:08.554
Poor Dunbar.

654
00:45:08.556 --> 00:45:11.257
He shouldn't be taking drugs.

655
00:45:27.508 --> 00:45:30.243
'Please come out.

656
00:45:30.245 --> 00:45:32.478
- 'Mommy's tired.'
- 'Hockey player.'


657
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.215
'Mommy's tired and fat.

658
00:45:36.217 --> 00:45:38.251
'We're gonna have a little baby.

659
00:45:38.253 --> 00:45:41.454
'Did you look at that?
Not funny.


660
00:45:42.323 --> 00:45:44.090
- 'I'm hot.'
- 'You're hot?'


661
00:45:44.092 --> 00:45:45.625
- 'Yes.'
- 'No...'


662
00:45:45.627 --> 00:45:49.128
- 'Don't do it.'
- 'I'm hungry, too.'


663
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:51.063
'I am hungry.
I'm hungry and I'm hot.'


664
00:45:51.065 --> 00:45:53.366
- 'Babe, you are hot.'
- 'It's beautiful, but...'


665
00:45:53.368 --> 00:45:55.301
- 'You're hot!'
- 'I am not.'


666
00:45:55.303 --> 00:45:56.602
'You're hot, baby.

667
00:45:56.604 --> 00:45:59.105
- 'You're smiling.'
- 'You're such a jackass.'


668
00:45:59.107 --> 00:46:00.706
'I love when you smile.'

669
00:46:02.343 --> 00:46:05.645
- 'OK, no more camera.'
- 'Alright, no more camera.


670
00:46:05.647 --> 00:46:07.446
'No more camera.'

671
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.325
Where are you, you little shit?

672
00:47:03.338 --> 00:47:05.137
Blazer.

673
00:47:05.139 --> 00:47:07.873
Gonna put on a blazer.

674
00:47:37.405 --> 00:47:39.739
Hey.

675
00:47:40.908 --> 00:47:42.742
No, I'm gonna pass.

676
00:47:42.744 --> 00:47:44.210
Because look, look.
Here's the thing.


677
00:47:44.212 --> 00:47:46.712
If I'm gonna be away on location
away from Danny that long,


678
00:47:46.714 --> 00:47:49.215
they got to make it worth
my while. They got to come up.


679
00:47:49.217 --> 00:47:50.649
That's just it.

680
00:47:52.253 --> 00:47:55.788
Anyways, I missed your mom
this week.


681
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:59.892
Yeah, Brenda's on another
one of her tears.


682
00:47:59.894 --> 00:48:03.529
No, I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.


683
00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:08.401
Hey! You should know I, uh...

684
00:48:09.537 --> 00:48:12.004
kissed the maid again.

685
00:48:12.006 --> 00:48:14.640
Cos I'm an idiot.

686
00:48:16.144 --> 00:48:19.311
I don't know, man.

687
00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:22.581
Some weirdo's been
sneaking around the house.


688
00:48:23.618 --> 00:48:27.153
Yeah, I'll talk to you later,
OK?


689
00:48:27.155 --> 00:48:29.155
Alright, call me.

690
00:48:40.301 --> 00:48:43.636
So, what's up? Mom doesn't make
you brush your teeth at home?


691
00:48:43.638 --> 00:48:46.972
- Not a lot.
- What do you mean, "not a lot"?


692
00:48:46.974 --> 00:48:48.541
Not as much as you do.

693
00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:53.345
I think I dropped your toothbrush
on the ground last night.


694
00:48:53.347 --> 00:48:55.414
Nah, I'm just kidding.

695
00:48:55.416 --> 00:48:56.682
Look, listen to me.

696
00:48:56.684 --> 00:48:58.651
Just because Mom
doesn't enforce a rule


697
00:48:58.653 --> 00:49:00.986
doesn't mean you can't
not do something. Alright?


698
00:49:00.988 --> 00:49:03.656
You got to brush your teeth
in the morning and at night,


699
00:49:03.658 --> 00:49:06.559
because that's what big boys do.
Big boys brush their teeth.


700
00:49:06.561 --> 00:49:10.262
And you're becoming a big boy
now, so you got to do it.


701
00:49:10.264 --> 00:49:11.730
Spit.

702
00:49:11.732 --> 00:49:14.767
I don't know why
you don't run the sink.


703
00:49:15.603 --> 00:49:17.770
- How's Mom?
- Good.


704
00:49:17.772 --> 00:49:19.972
Yeah? She getting you
to school OK?


705
00:49:19.974 --> 00:49:21.340
- Yeah.
- Promise?


706
00:49:21.342 --> 00:49:23.275
- Yeah.
- OK.


707
00:49:23.277 --> 00:49:26.512
You know, if there's anything
you ever need or want,


708
00:49:26.514 --> 00:49:28.581
- you can call me, right?
- Yeah.


709
00:49:28.583 --> 00:49:30.716
If you ever got any problems,
or whatever.


710
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:31.817
Yeah.

711
00:49:31.819 --> 00:49:34.453
Alright. I love you, buddy.

712
00:49:34.455 --> 00:49:37.456
Sleep well, alright?

713
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:13.979
'I wonder how many
times we bought the same work?


714
00:52:13.981 --> 00:52:18.384
'Hey, I mean, praying's
for church, huh? Come on.'


715
00:52:18.386 --> 00:52:20.519
'I haven't
seen you in church lately.'


716
00:52:20.521 --> 00:52:26.091
'Well, not much
sense in my going to church.


717
00:52:26.093 --> 00:52:29.895
'Do you remember one time when
we were small, we were out here?


718
00:52:29.897 --> 00:52:31.830
'It was from right over there.

719
00:52:31.832 --> 00:52:33.899
'I jumped out at you
from behind the tree


720
00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:36.201
'and grandpa got all excited
and he shook his fist at me.


721
00:52:36.203 --> 00:52:39.638
'And he said,
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."


722
00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.675
- 'Remember that?'
- Come on in.


723
00:52:42.677 --> 00:52:45.277
'You used to really be scared.'

724
00:52:45.279 --> 00:52:48.747
- 'Johnny.'
- 'You're still afraid.'


725
00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:50.949
'Stop it now, I mean it.'

726
00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:54.520
Oh...
Don't mind my little Moosey.


727
00:52:54.522 --> 00:52:57.289
'They're coming
to get you, Barbara.'


728
00:52:58.259 --> 00:53:00.526
'Stop it. You're ignorant.'

729
00:53:00.528 --> 00:53:02.761
'They're coming for you,
Barbara.'


730
00:53:02.763 --> 00:53:06.065
'Stop it.
You're acting like a child.'


731
00:53:06.067 --> 00:53:08.100
'They're coming for you.

732
00:53:08.102 --> 00:53:11.370
'Look, there comes
one of them now.'


733
00:53:11.372 --> 00:53:13.972
- 'He'll hear you.'
- 'Here he comes now.


734
00:53:13.974 --> 00:53:16.975
- 'I'm getting out.'
- 'Johnny!'


735
00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:48.140
You OK with some music?

736
00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:50.776
- You like a little Limp Bizkit?
- Sure.


737
00:53:50.778 --> 00:53:53.145
- You like a little Bizkit?
- Yeah.


738
00:53:55.049 --> 00:53:57.683
I used to listen to this
back in the day.


739
00:53:57.685 --> 00:54:02.755
Oh, my God, that is nice.
That is nice.


740
00:54:04.258 --> 00:54:06.792
Ah, here we go, baby.

741
00:54:28.282 --> 00:54:30.082
Stay here.

742
00:54:32.987 --> 00:54:34.520
What the hell
are you doing back here?


743
00:54:34.522 --> 00:54:37.356
- I just... I just... I... I...
- "I... just..."


744
00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:39.625
Maybe I didn't make myself clear
the first time,


745
00:54:39.627 --> 00:54:41.226
you stuttering fuck.

746
00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:43.796
You wanna live to see tomorrow?

747
00:54:43.798 --> 00:54:45.731
- Yes, sir.
- Then you stay away from me,


748
00:54:45.733 --> 00:54:47.399
and you stay away from my son.

749
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:50.202
And never set foot
in this neighborhood again.


750
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:53.439
- Do you understand? Huh?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.


751
00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:58.010
Now, I catch you
in this neighborhood again,


752
00:54:58.012 --> 00:55:01.413
I will shove my Remington
shotgun so far up your ass


753
00:55:01.415 --> 00:55:04.383
you'll be shitting bullets and
blood for the rest of your life.


754
00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:06.585
You understand?
I want you to say it.


755
00:55:06.587 --> 00:55:09.455
- I want to hear you say it.
- "I'll be shitting bullets..."


756
00:55:09.457 --> 00:55:12.691
No, you idiot! Say you'll never
come in this neighborhood again.


757
00:55:12.693 --> 00:55:15.093
Say it. Say it!

758
00:55:15.863 --> 00:55:17.896
I'll never come back here.

759
00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:20.599
- Goddamn right!
- Never.


760
00:55:23.404 --> 00:55:26.338
Go back where you came from,
you stalker!


761
00:55:29.677 --> 00:55:32.945
I am not a stalker!

762
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.510
Ow!

763
00:57:11.512 --> 00:57:13.345
Ow!

764
00:57:21.989 --> 00:57:23.922
Am I alright?

765
00:57:23.924 --> 00:57:26.358
Am I alright?

766
00:57:38.572 --> 00:57:42.341
Oh, he's everything,
I'm nothing.


767
00:57:44.445 --> 00:57:49.381
Well, let me tell you something,
Mr. Dunbar, Mr. Dummybar!


768
00:57:50.417 --> 00:57:51.984
You have not...

769
00:57:51.986 --> 00:57:55.754
I repeat, you have not made
the best choices.


770
00:57:55.756 --> 00:57:58.857
"Ghost Train" was so stupid.

771
00:57:58.859 --> 00:58:01.760
It was so stupid.

772
00:58:01.762 --> 00:58:04.596
And who stuck by you
all the time?


773
00:58:04.598 --> 00:58:07.299
Me! I did!

774
00:58:09.269 --> 00:58:14.172
This is a nightmare!
This is a freakin' nightmare!


775
00:58:16.477 --> 00:58:19.444
No! It is not OK!

776
00:58:20.481 --> 00:58:23.115
It is not OK!

777
00:58:44.038 --> 00:58:45.637
You're not nice.

778
00:58:45.639 --> 00:58:48.707
You're a big fake!

779
00:58:54.515 --> 00:58:58.350
'Aren't you afraid of them
seeking revenge?'


780
00:58:58.352 --> 00:59:00.352
'Revenge is my middle name.'

781
00:59:00.354 --> 00:59:04.890
You just pretend all day,
that's all you do.


782
00:59:04.892 --> 00:59:07.392
Anybody can do that.

783
00:59:07.928 --> 00:59:10.362
Anybody can do that!

784
00:59:14.868 --> 00:59:16.668
'Kiss me, Vigo.'

785
00:59:37.291 --> 00:59:39.825
Moose!

786
00:59:41.462 --> 00:59:44.629
Moose, open up!
I know you're in there.


787
00:59:55.042 --> 00:59:57.676
You look like shit.

788
00:59:59.113 --> 01:00:01.813
It smells like gasoline.

789
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:04.716
So...

790
01:00:04.718 --> 01:00:07.819
been using your, uh, Star Map
app to visit some friends?


791
01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:10.422
What are you talking about?

792
01:00:14.461 --> 01:00:16.895
You've been using
your social media


793
01:00:16.897 --> 01:00:19.397
to broadcast
criminal activities.


794
01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:22.901
Kissing Hunter Dunbar
while he's sleeping?


795
01:00:22.903 --> 01:00:24.603
You're officially
out of your mind.


796
01:00:24.605 --> 01:00:26.605
I could show these photos
to the police


797
01:00:26.607 --> 01:00:28.507
and you'd be in trouble.

798
01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:30.442
Don't do that. 
Don't do that.

799
01:00:30.444 --> 01:00:32.644
Well, you don't listen
to anything.


800
01:00:32.646 --> 01:00:36.515
You don't listen to me,
and... you don't follow rules.


801
01:00:41.321 --> 01:00:43.054
- Give me your phone.
- No.


802
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.556
- Give me your phone.
- No.


803
01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:48.360
Give me your phone! Give me
your phone or this is it. OK?


804
01:00:48.362 --> 01:00:50.328
No more borrowing money. No more
advice. No more anything.


805
01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:51.763
Is that what you want?
To lose your BBF?


806
01:00:51.765 --> 01:00:55.333
To lose your only friend
in the entire world?


807
01:00:57.704 --> 01:00:59.037
You're mean!

808
01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:01.840
You're mean!

809
01:01:01.842 --> 01:01:05.277
OK, that's it, Leah.
Look at this. You're blocked.


810
01:01:05.279 --> 01:01:08.346
You're blocked from
my social media. You go!


811
01:01:08.348 --> 01:01:11.283
You go! You get out of here!

812
01:01:11.285 --> 01:01:13.919
I'm trying to protect you.

813
01:02:25.859 --> 01:02:28.827
What the fuck? 
What the fuck?

814
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:29.961
What the fuck?

815
01:02:31.131 --> 01:02:32.931
Hey!

816
01:02:32.933 --> 01:02:34.699
Help!

817
01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.303
Help!

818
01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.710
Oh, you fucking idiot.

819
01:02:45.712 --> 01:02:48.013
You fucking idiot.

820
01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:50.148
You stupid psycho stalker.

821
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:55.020
You fucking... Help!

822
01:02:59.259 --> 01:03:01.893
You've been Jigsawed.

823
01:03:01.895 --> 01:03:03.194
Game over.

824
01:03:12.806 --> 01:03:14.973
Help!

825
01:03:22.582 --> 01:03:24.416
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

826
01:03:24.418 --> 01:03:27.285
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.


827
01:03:27.287 --> 01:03:30.889
Wait, wait. Wait! Wait! Wait!

828
01:03:38.999 --> 01:03:40.532
I fooled Hunter Dunbar.

829
01:03:40.534 --> 01:03:43.969
I fooled Hunter Dunbar!
I'm such a good actor.


830
01:03:43.971 --> 01:03:46.404
- You outta your mind?
- You were good, too, though.


831
01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.239
You were really good.
You were good.


832
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.508
You were better
than Jamie Lee Curtis.


833
01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:54.045
OK.

834
01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:55.613
Did I cut you?

835
01:03:59.686 --> 01:04:01.519
Holy crap.

836
01:04:09.229 --> 01:04:11.896
Oh, this isn't good.

837
01:04:11.898 --> 01:04:13.631
Oh, this is not good.

838
01:04:13.633 --> 01:04:16.234
You're out of line. Let me go.

839
01:04:16.236 --> 01:04:17.602
What do you want?

840
01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:20.438
Why are you so angry
all the time?


841
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.841
I should be the one
angry at you.


842
01:04:22.843 --> 01:04:24.743
Why do you care so much
about me?


843
01:04:24.745 --> 01:04:27.479
Because I love you.
And I love you. And I love you.


844
01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:29.681
And I... and I've seen
all your movies.


845
01:04:29.683 --> 01:04:32.450
And I love your movies.
And I... think you're the best.


846
01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:36.087
Untie these ropes,
you son of a bitch. Untie them!


847
01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:39.491
Stop being so mean to me!
Stop it!


848
01:04:39.493 --> 01:04:42.761
What? You looking for
your 15 minutes of fame? Huh?


849
01:04:42.763 --> 01:04:44.763
You wanna end up
on the nightly news?


850
01:04:44.765 --> 01:04:47.665
They're gonna call you
a monster.


851
01:04:51.838 --> 01:04:53.438
What's in the bag?

852
01:04:55.275 --> 01:04:59.544
Hunter, be patient, please.
It's a surprise.


853
01:05:00.714 --> 01:05:02.480
OK, ready?

854
01:05:03.283 --> 01:05:04.482
Mr. Blonde.

855
01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.885
- Holy shit! No.
- Mr. Blonde.


856
01:05:06.887 --> 01:05:10.822
No, no, no.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Ahh!


857
01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:18.229
Don't burn me!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey!


858
01:05:18.231 --> 01:05:20.832
There's no gas in here,
it's just water.


859
01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:24.002
I'm not gonna burn
your house down or nothing.


860
01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:25.236
Come on.

861
01:05:25.238 --> 01:05:27.005
I'm sorry I was mean to you.

862
01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:29.240
You're the meanest person
I've ever known in my life.


863
01:05:29.242 --> 01:05:31.476
Let me make it up to you.

864
01:05:31.478 --> 01:05:33.011
I'll sign whatever you want.

865
01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:35.980
I even have the ceremonial
dagger from "The Hungry Ones".


866
01:05:35.982 --> 01:05:37.649
I could get it.
I can sign it right now.


867
01:05:37.651 --> 01:05:39.851
What kind of moron
do you think I am?


868
01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:42.287
I don't think anybody's a moron.

869
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:43.788
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.


870
01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:47.092
And I know what you think of me.
You think I'm a stalker!


871
01:05:47.094 --> 01:05:48.960
- No.
- Yes, you do.


872
01:05:48.962 --> 01:05:52.130
But I go to every one
of your movies.


873
01:05:52.132 --> 01:05:54.332
Even the crappy ones.

874
01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:58.002
You've got to understand
something.


875
01:05:58.004 --> 01:06:00.472
You hold the power
in this relationship.


876
01:06:01.842 --> 01:06:05.210
You're a fan,
and I'm nothing without you.


877
01:06:08.415 --> 01:06:09.814
Say that again.

878
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.551
- What?
- What you said, say it.


879
01:06:17.858 --> 01:06:20.525
You are a fan.

880
01:06:21.428 --> 01:06:23.094
Without you...

881
01:06:24.097 --> 01:06:25.597
I'm nothing.

882
01:06:29.169 --> 01:06:30.502
Are you hungry?

883
01:06:32.038 --> 01:06:33.938
I'm hungry.

884
01:06:35.609 --> 01:06:38.476
You stay there. 
Don't you move.

885
01:06:38.478 --> 01:06:40.145
Don't you move.

886
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:44.716
Holy fuck.

887
01:06:44.718 --> 01:06:47.585
Holy fuck. Holy fuck.

888
01:06:49.556 --> 01:06:51.656
Holy fuck! Holy fuck!

889
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.095
'Moose didn't
just cross the line,


890
01:06:59.533 --> 01:07:02.233
'he fucking nuked it.

891
01:07:06.873 --> 01:07:10.542
'Honestly, I'd be scared, too.

892
01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.879
'Poor Moosey.'

893
01:07:15.882 --> 01:07:17.649
Hey.

894
01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.387
Come here.

895
01:07:22.389 --> 01:07:24.055
Let me sign one for you.

896
01:07:28.161 --> 01:07:31.396
Moose? Is that it?

897
01:07:31.398 --> 01:07:34.499
"To... Moose."

898
01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:36.901
"With love,."

899
01:07:36.903 --> 01:07:40.538
"Hunter Dunbar."

900
01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:52.550
Barbara.

901
01:07:52.552 --> 01:07:55.687
Oh, Barbara.

902
01:07:55.689 --> 01:07:59.991
They're coming to get you,
Barbara.


903
01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.559
Barbara.

904
01:08:01.561 --> 01:08:04.696
They're coming to get you,
Barbara.


905
01:08:04.698 --> 01:08:07.599
They're coming to get you,
Barbara.


906
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.540
"Night of the Living Dead".

907
01:08:15.542 --> 01:08:17.342
Why don't you know that?

908
01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:18.643
I'm starting to think

909
01:08:18.645 --> 01:08:20.712
you don't know anything
about horror pictures.


910
01:08:20.714 --> 01:08:22.614
Sorry to disappoint.

911
01:08:22.616 --> 01:08:24.882
This...

912
01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:29.220
It's not... It's not bad.
It just isn't a treat.


913
01:08:29.222 --> 01:08:31.556
I think Danny's
gonna grow up hating you.


914
01:08:31.558 --> 01:08:32.824
Don't talk about my son.

915
01:08:32.826 --> 01:08:35.260
You have no ice cream
in the fridge at all.


916
01:08:35.262 --> 01:08:36.494
Then I'll work on it.

917
01:08:36.496 --> 01:08:39.063
Look... Here, look.
Taste it. Taste it.


918
01:08:39.065 --> 01:08:40.832
Go ahead.

919
01:08:41.635 --> 01:08:44.269
See? See?

920
01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:47.538
It's not sweet.
It's not a treat.


921
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.140
It's not a treat.

922
01:08:49.142 --> 01:08:51.676
But they need
good tasting treats.


923
01:08:51.678 --> 01:08:53.077
And then horror pictures.

924
01:08:53.079 --> 01:08:56.681
- He's gonna remember this.
- I'll get ice cream, OK?


925
01:08:57.217 --> 01:08:59.784
I'll get it.

926
01:08:59.786 --> 01:09:02.620
I'll get him some right now
if you untie these ropes.


927
01:09:05.158 --> 01:09:07.058
I can't do that.

928
01:09:07.694 --> 01:09:10.028
Of course you can.

929
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:12.096
You're gonna get me in trouble.

930
01:09:12.098 --> 01:09:13.765
No.

931
01:09:13.767 --> 01:09:17.669
- Are you gonna hurt me?
- No. I won't do that.


932
01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:25.009
I know you're a good person.

933
01:09:29.249 --> 01:09:34.619
I seem mean and... angry...

934
01:09:34.621 --> 01:09:37.789
but I'm just scared, man.
I'm just...


935
01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:40.892
I'm just really scared.

936
01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.401
And I know you are, too.

937
01:09:52.572 --> 01:09:54.405
You scared?

938
01:09:56.876 --> 01:09:58.810
You just wanna leave, right?

939
01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:05.683
That's alright, man. That's OK.

940
01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.729
This doesn't feel good.

941
01:10:20.066 --> 01:10:23.167
Hear me out, OK?

942
01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:27.839
If you let me go, I pledge...

943
01:10:27.841 --> 01:10:31.909
I... I swear to God...
I swear to God,


944
01:10:31.911 --> 01:10:34.645
I will not call the police.

945
01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.848
That's a promise
between you and me.


946
01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:38.583
- No police?
- No police.


947
01:10:38.585 --> 01:10:40.752
- No police.
- And after that...


948
01:10:40.754 --> 01:10:43.254
I will sign whatever you want,

949
01:10:43.256 --> 01:10:46.424
whenever you want,
for the rest of your life.


950
01:10:46.426 --> 01:10:47.992
That's another promise.

951
01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.862
That is a lifetime commitment.

952
01:10:50.864 --> 01:10:53.564
- You'd sign for me?
- For a real fan.


953
01:10:53.566 --> 01:10:55.433
You'll sign for me?

954
01:10:55.435 --> 01:10:57.268
You'll sign for me personally?

955
01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:01.606
Because everything on eBay
is a lie, it's a fake.


956
01:11:01.608 --> 01:11:02.974
Hell, yeah.

957
01:11:02.976 --> 01:11:04.809
- Yeah?
- Hell, yeah!


958
01:11:04.811 --> 01:11:07.311
You're smart. You're real smart.

959
01:11:07.313 --> 01:11:11.149
I will sign everything
personally to you.


960
01:11:11.151 --> 01:11:14.385
- What's your name?
- Moose.


961
01:11:15.622 --> 01:11:17.555
- Did you say Moose?
- Moose.


962
01:11:17.557 --> 01:11:20.057
OK. OK, Moose.

963
01:11:20.059 --> 01:11:23.327
All the autographs
will be personally autographed


964
01:11:23.329 --> 01:11:25.496
to you, Moose.

965
01:11:28.635 --> 01:11:30.001
Is that it?

966
01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:35.406
Just don't hurt my kid.

967
01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:40.912
Hurt your kid? Wh...

968
01:11:40.914 --> 01:11:44.715
I would never ever, ever,
ever hurt your son!


969
01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.083
Ever!

970
01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:49.020
Why would you even say that?

971
01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:53.891
Just let me go, man.

972
01:12:01.668 --> 01:12:03.801
I'm an actor, alright?

973
01:12:06.039 --> 01:12:08.539
Well, actors
they try this technique


974
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:11.075
called visualization.

975
01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.010
What is that? What is that?

976
01:12:13.012 --> 01:12:15.112
It means to imagine.

977
01:12:20.687 --> 01:12:23.120
You wanna try
this technique with me?


978
01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:27.191
Alright, here. Come here.

979
01:12:27.193 --> 01:12:30.495
Kneel down, get comfortable.

980
01:12:30.497 --> 01:12:32.964
Drop your shoulders. Relax.

981
01:12:32.966 --> 01:12:36.367
Go ahead, drop 'em. Just
feel comfortable. Just relax.


982
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.804
I need you to take
a deep breath in.


983
01:12:47.714 --> 01:12:49.480
Yeah.

984
01:12:50.884 --> 01:12:55.386
Now I want you to imagine
you and me.


985
01:12:55.388 --> 01:12:57.588
- You and me?
- Yeah. You see us?


986
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:59.023
- I do.
- Alright.


987
01:12:59.025 --> 01:13:00.358
First thing we're gonna do, is

988
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.693
we're gonna change
these dirty clothes.


989
01:13:02.695 --> 01:13:06.130
We're gonna take off this sweat,
this blood and this gasoline,


990
01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.332
and we're gonna put on
some fresh new duds.


991
01:13:08.334 --> 01:13:11.903
We're gonna look spiffy, Moose.
We're gonna look good.


992
01:13:11.905 --> 01:13:13.404
And then we're gonna go out
on the town.


993
01:13:13.406 --> 01:13:16.307
We're gonna go to one of those
Hollywood fancy joints.


994
01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:19.143
Musso & Frank's?
We're going to Musso & Frank's?


995
01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.511
Wherever you want, man.

996
01:13:20.513 --> 01:13:22.480
We'll go wherever you want.
I'll call my manager,


997
01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.682
he'll get us a table
wherever you wanna go.


998
01:13:24.684 --> 01:13:26.317
And when it's all done,

999
01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:28.119
we'll get a big bowl
of chocolate ice cream.


1000
01:13:28.121 --> 01:13:29.954
Strawberry.
Strawberry ice cream.


1001
01:13:29.956 --> 01:13:32.356
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1002
01:13:32.358 --> 01:13:35.293
Strawberry ice cream, Moose,
of course. Of course.


1003
01:13:35.295 --> 01:13:38.262
And then... and then
we'll go back to my place


1004
01:13:38.264 --> 01:13:40.865
and throw on a couple
of my action films,


1005
01:13:40.867 --> 01:13:42.967
and watch them on the HD TV.

1006
01:13:42.969 --> 01:13:45.269
Does that sound good, man?

1007
01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:49.140
- I love you. I love you.
- Ah, you, me,


1008
01:13:49.142 --> 01:13:51.175
couple of action flicks,

1009
01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:54.478
and some strawberry ice cream,
right?


1010
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.582
- Just... just you and I, man.
- Just you and me.


1011
01:13:57.584 --> 01:14:00.651
Wait, we just got to take
these ropes off first, you know?


1012
01:14:00.653 --> 01:14:03.154
- OK. OK.
- Yeah? Alright.


1013
01:14:03.156 --> 01:14:04.255
OK.

1014
01:14:06.459 --> 01:14:08.826
Man, wait till you see
this collection.


1015
01:14:08.828 --> 01:14:10.428
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


1016
01:14:14.434 --> 01:14:17.168
These are some serious knots.
Where'd you learn these?


1017
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.270
- YouTube.
- YouTube?


1018
01:14:19.272 --> 01:14:21.305
YouTube. Teaches you everything.

1019
01:14:21.307 --> 01:14:25.276
Teaches you all kind of knots.
C knots, barrel knots.


1020
01:14:26.746 --> 01:14:28.279
Put it here, pal.

1021
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:33.244
You can't leave, Moose.

1022
01:15:33.246 --> 01:15:35.946
I'm nothing without you.

1023
01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:49.326
I just like your movies.

1024
01:18:35.561 --> 01:18:36.760
Oh, man!

1025
01:19:04.257 --> 01:19:05.990
Holy shit!

1026
01:19:17.803 --> 01:19:19.370
Oh, my God!

1027
01:19:19.372 --> 01:19:21.705
What happened?

1028
01:19:21.707 --> 01:19:23.674
OK, you know what?
It's OK, we're...


1029
01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:27.344
I'm gonna get you some help.
I'm right here, buddy, OK?


1030
01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.980
'And Hunter? He's an actor.'

1031
01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:32.683
Oh, God, please, God.

1032
01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:36.553
'And he's a survivor.

1033
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:40.991
'It's Dora
that I'm worried about.'


1034
01:20:46.559 --> 01:20:47.958
My head!

1035
01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.693
'I know, I know,

1036
01:20:49.695 --> 01:20:52.796
'Moose lost his hand
and his eye.


1037
01:20:54.066 --> 01:20:56.867
'But eventually, he looked at it
like a badge of honor.'


1038
01:20:56.869 --> 01:21:00.304
I can't see without my glasses.
What does it say?


1039
01:21:00.306 --> 01:21:02.473
It says, "Louise...
Louise Fletcher."


1040
01:21:02.475 --> 01:21:06.043
Louise Fletcher,
she's not a good nurse.


1041
01:21:06.045 --> 01:21:08.278
- No.
- She's not.


1042
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.547
No, she's not.

1043
01:21:19.492 --> 01:21:22.059
I am not a stalker!
