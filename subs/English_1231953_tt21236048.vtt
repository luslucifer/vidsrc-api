00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:20.008
I know
these types of stories


2
00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:22.094
usually open on a giant book

3
00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:24.263
that says "Once upon a time..."

4
00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:27.307
But this is a story
about me, Lia.


5
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:29.434
And, well, tea.

6
00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:31.812
Oh, no. Not that kind.

7
00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.730
Mmm. That's better.

8
00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:35.482
Growing up in Townsville,

9
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.110
Richard and I would listen to
my grandma, Popo,


10
00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:40.237
talk about tea for hours.

11
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:42.447
Who's Richard?

12
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:44.241
He was my best friend

13
00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.535
who turned into
my first letdown.


14
00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:50.956
Anyway, Popo was my
favourite person in the world.


15
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.332
When she passed,

16
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:55.711
she left me the money to open
a tea shop in Sydney...


17
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.383
...as far away from my old life
as I could go.


18
00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:04.636
I named the shop after Popo,

19
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.724
and everything
was going to be perfect.


20
00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:10.726
Making a good cup of tea

21
00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:14.313
is like a beautiful ballet.

22
00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:16.940
When all the elements meet...

23
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:22.362
It's the closest thing
you can get... to magic.


24
00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:26.575
So you don't have bubble tea.

25
00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:27.951
- Get out.
- What?


26
00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:29.244
- Now.
- Oh!


27
00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:33.498
I've been saying
you need bubble tea.


28
00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:35.792
It is not that kind of shop.

29
00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:38.670
We are an artisanal tea shop
that specialises in


30
00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:41.214
authentic, handcrafted
Chinese tea experiences.


31
00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:43.008
- Mm-hm.
- It is a beautiful dance.


32
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:44.301
Oh.

33
00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:45.677
And the bubble tea
is the Macarena.


34
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:47.971
Well, everybody loves
the Macarena, boo.


35
00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:51.516
And tradition
isn't paying the bills. Look...


36
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.645
We've got electric.
We got your phone bill.


37
00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:56.355
And we've got something
with a big red stamp on it,


38
00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:58.941
which cannot be good.

39
00:01:59.024 --> 00:02:02.069
But, anyway, are you ready?

40
00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:03.320
Ready for what?

41
00:02:03.403 --> 00:02:05.030
Our flight to Townsville
tomorrow


42
00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:07.115
for your sister's
bougie engagement party.


43
00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:09.201
- That's tomorrow?
- Yeah, exactly.


44
00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:12.329
So, tonight, I figured we could
go out and blow off some steam.


45
00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:13.997
- Oh! See!

46
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:15.374
Even your tea agrees.

00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:43.819
Oh, sorry.

59
00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:47.990
OK, um... No worries.

60
00:02:51.702 --> 00:02:54.788
Oh, my God! Lady!

61
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.374
Did not even know
what it looks like anymore


62
00:02:57.457 --> 00:02:58.709
when someone's interested?

63
00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:01.044
That guy was totally into you,

64
00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:03.672
and you just completely
ignored him just now.


65
00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.675
Oh. Well, I had a thought
come to me.


66
00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:08.635
If I don't have
a few ideas written down


67
00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.804
for my maid of honour speech,

68
00:03:10.887 --> 00:03:12.264
Alice is going to think
I don't care.


69
00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:15.892
OK, so I'm guessing
you won't be taking a plus-one


70
00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:17.519
to the engagement party.

71
00:03:17.602 --> 00:03:18.937
No. You're my plus-one.

72
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:21.606
Oh, absolutely not, boo. No.

73
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.525
I'm going with you, yes.

74
00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:25.861
- But I'm riding solo.
- What?


75
00:03:25.944 --> 00:03:28.196
My future ex-husband
could be there.


76
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.575
- What?
- In Townsville?


77
00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:33.994
- Yeah. In Townsville? Why not?

78
00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:36.163
OK. Well, cheers,
to your future ex-husband.


79
00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:38.957
Cheers. May he be rich
and near death.

How's it going up there,
Grandma?


87
00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:13.950
Alice is getting married
to the man of her dreams.


88
00:04:14.034 --> 00:04:16.078
And I am just...

89
00:04:17.788 --> 00:04:19.289
...drowning.

90
00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.419
Sweet girl, you're not gonna
let us down.


91
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.465
Well, about that...

92
00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:31.551
I've only got
one month of rent left


93
00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:33.095
from the money that
you left me,


94
00:04:33.178 --> 00:04:36.765

OK, so, I didn't know your

103
00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:04.334
Mmm.

104
00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:06.503
It's actually quite nice here.

105
00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:07.963
Hmm, well, you haven't met

106
00:05:08.046 --> 00:05:10.006
the tree from which
the apple fell yet.


107
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:14.761
I think that's our ride.

108
00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:23.645
- For Lia?
- Yeah, mate, yeah.


109
00:05:23.728 --> 00:05:24.896
Chuck your bags in the back.

110
00:05:30.443 --> 00:05:31.778
What brings you
to Townsville?


111
00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:33.822
We're here for
the run up to our wedding.


112
00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:35.949
It's my sister's
engagement party.


113
00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:37.868
Are you Alice's sister?

114
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:39.911
- Yeah. Do you know her?

115
00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:41.830
Yeah. Everyone knows her.

116
00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.540
She's practically
the mayor of Townsville.


117
00:05:48.753 --> 00:05:51.089
Thank you so much.

118
00:05:55.343 --> 00:05:57.512
- Oh, my God!

119
00:06:00.056 --> 00:06:01.641
Oh, Al, this is my...

120
00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:04.186
You must be Mason!

121
00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:06.605
Lia has told me absolutely
nothing about you.


122
00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:09.482
But, honestly,
I already feel your energy.


123
00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:12.027
And I know we're going to
be like sisters!


124
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.695
Ohh!

125
00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:15.906
Well, enchante.

126
00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:19.159
Lia, you look good.

127
00:06:19.242 --> 00:06:21.036
Are you doing OK?

128
00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:23.622
Is that a compliment
or an accusation?


129
00:06:23.705 --> 00:06:26.041
You look good, which means
you're probably not eating enough.


130
00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:29.794
OK! [laughs] I like her,
and I also I like you with her.


131
00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:31.796
- This is just very fun for me.
- Ooh!


132
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.507
Listen, today, of all days,

133
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:36.968
is the one day you do not
have to worry about <i>me.</i>


134
00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:39.554
Instead, I get to
worry about <i>you!</i>


135
00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:44.768
- Lia!
- Oh!


136
00:06:44.851 --> 00:06:46.102
- Gilly!
- It's been such a long time.


137
00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:47.604
It has!

138
00:06:47.687 --> 00:06:49.231
Your mum's waiting inside.

139
00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:50.982
Oh, wow. OK.

140
00:06:55.737 --> 00:06:57.906
Um...

141
00:06:57.989 --> 00:06:59.824
I'm just going to freshen up.

142
00:06:59.908 --> 00:07:01.743
OK.

143
00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:03.662
Thank you.

144
00:07:11.962 --> 00:07:13.421
Oh, dear God.

145
00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:23.932
- Lia.
- Hi, Mum.


146
00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:25.517
So glad you could join us.

147
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.935
Oh.

148
00:07:28.228 --> 00:07:31.314
Oh! You look nice.

149
00:07:31.398 --> 00:07:33.733
Oh, yes. Thank you. Um...

150
00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:36.569
The frilly look is really in
right now in Sydney.


151
00:07:36.653 --> 00:07:37.988
- Thank you.

152
00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.991
You look like one of the crew
from Pirates Of The Caribbean.


153
00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:43.076
Oh, Lia, how is the shop?

154
00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:45.412
Doing well.

155
00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:46.579
It is?

156
00:07:46.663 --> 00:07:49.040
Mm-hm. Yeah, we're
really seeing an upswing.


157
00:07:49.124 --> 00:07:50.709
Yeah, we, um...

158
00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:52.252
Sorry, we are.

159
00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:53.545
You said two years.

160
00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:54.879
Well, you said two years.

161
00:07:56.172 --> 00:07:59.551
Well, it seems like you are
making something of yourself.


162
00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:02.721
- Hey, kid!
- Dad!


163
00:08:02.804 --> 00:08:04.848
- Mwah!
- Hi, Baba.


164
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:06.891
We are just surprised
you made it.


165
00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:08.184
Oh?

166
00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:11.104
You were never
here for us before.


167
00:08:11.813 --> 00:08:13.189
I'm so glad

168
00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:15.483
you could start now.

169
00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:18.153
And you can all see...

170
00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:20.572
the reason
is right in front of us.


171
00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:25.285
Mum, are you sure
the fortune teller's coming?


172
00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:26.494
Mrs Li will be here.

173
00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:28.997
It's a Chinese tradition
to have your fortune told


174
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.458
- before big events...
- Like our wedding.


175
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:34.294
I've been waiting
my entire life for this.


176
00:08:34.377 --> 00:08:36.921
I mean, we have, right, Nigel?

177
00:08:37.005 --> 00:08:38.214
That's right, babe.

178
00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:42.010
Oh, wait!

179
00:08:42.093 --> 00:08:43.470
Wait for Mrs Li.

180
00:09:02.739 --> 00:09:04.282
Your I
-Ching horoscope.

181
00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:13.166
Your wedding is February 14th?

182
00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:15.668
Yes. I love love!

183
00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:17.962
You should have been married
in April.


184
00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:20.006
Should I switch the date?

185
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.092
Th... The deposit's
non-refundable.


186
00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:25.595
Your ovaries are very healthy.

187
00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:27.347
Very powerful flow.

188
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.140
Pregnant on first try.

189
00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:31.559
This one is good.

190
00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:32.977
Stable.

191
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.312
Obedient.

192
00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:36.940
A lap dog of a man!

193
00:09:37.023 --> 00:09:38.525
Oh. Right.

194
00:09:38.608 --> 00:09:41.861
And we aren't only
here to celebrate Nigel and I,


195
00:09:41.945 --> 00:09:44.280
we can celebrate
Lia's success as well.


196
00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:45.782
Mm-mm. No, no, no. It's OK.

197
00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:49.285
Like I said earlier,
today is all about you.


198
00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:50.995
- Yes.

199
00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:52.288
-  Lia.
- Mm-hm?


200
00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:54.082
I am very proud of you.

201
00:09:54.165 --> 00:09:55.875
Mm-hm.

202
00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:58.086
You're... what?

203
00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:01.339
I am proud of you.

204
00:10:02.882 --> 00:10:06.386
Well, we should have
another fortune told.


205
00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:09.931
Oh, no, I don't think
that's necessary, Dad.


206
00:10:10.014 --> 00:10:11.808
Nonsense!

207
00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:13.643
Xian is right.

208
00:10:13.726 --> 00:10:14.644
I'm what?

209
00:10:14.727 --> 00:10:16.813
I have a bat mitzvah
I must attend.


210
00:10:16.896 --> 00:10:18.940
Please hold up.

211
00:10:19.107 --> 00:10:20.233
Uh...

212
00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:24.362
You're right.

213
00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:27.240
Success has to be recognised.

214
00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.286
- Sweetheart, come on.
- No. I'm still eating my food!


215
00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:33.288
Come, come.

216
00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:34.789
I
-Ching horoscope.

217
00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:39.043
OK.

218
00:10:42.464 --> 00:10:45.341
You said your business
was successful?


219
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:46.551
On the rise.

220
00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:50.680
Mmm.

221
00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:51.764
Your palm.

222
00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.144
Um...

223
00:10:56.478 --> 00:11:01.149
Your love line and career line
are tangled.


224
00:11:02.192 --> 00:11:03.443
What does that mean?

225
00:11:03.568 --> 00:11:06.613
Finding your soul mate will
help your business.


226
00:11:07.071 --> 00:11:08.490
Which is...

227
00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:11.075
...on the rise.

228
00:11:13.578 --> 00:11:15.079
Cool.

229
00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:20.001
And this person will be one of
the next five dates you go on.


230
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.294
Five dates?

231
00:11:21.377 --> 00:11:23.379
Wh...? Oh, my God. What?
What about five dates?


232
00:11:23.463 --> 00:11:25.298
You will find a soulmate.

233
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:26.966
And it has to be
before the wedding.


234
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.178
That's less
than two months away!


235
00:11:34.015 --> 00:11:35.600
That was dumb.

236
00:11:36.643 --> 00:11:37.685
That was perfect.

237
00:11:39.229 --> 00:11:42.815
<i>♪ Let me catch my breath
Let me catch my breath ♪</i>


238
00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:44.817
<i>♪ Let me catch my</i>

239
00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:45.860

00:11:45.944 --> 00:11:47.695
<i>♪ Please...</i>

241
00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:54.285
Lia, just make sure
not to pick some dud.


242
00:11:54.369 --> 00:11:55.620
I don't pick duds.

243
00:11:57.038 --> 00:11:58.164
Why is everyone laughing?

244
00:11:58.248 --> 00:12:01.251
Lia, since I've known you,
you haven't even picked <i>a</i> dud.


245
00:12:01.334 --> 00:12:03.419
I mean, you literally
haven't picked anyone.


246
00:12:03.503 --> 00:12:05.046
You need someone adventurous!

247
00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:07.298
No, what she needs
is someone who is loyal


248
00:12:07.382 --> 00:12:09.634
- and is going to appreciate her!
-  Oh.


249
00:12:09.717 --> 00:12:11.803
You know what? Stop.
Everyone, just stop.


250
00:12:11.886 --> 00:12:14.055
I don't even
believe in fortune tellers.


251
00:12:14.138 --> 00:12:16.641
They just make things up
and hope it comes true.


252
00:12:16.724 --> 00:12:19.769
- But now we have a plan!
- What plan?


253
00:12:19.852 --> 00:12:23.147
Well, we each pick
one date for you.


254
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:24.190
What?

255
00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:25.984
I already have
the perfect man in mind.


256
00:12:26.067 --> 00:12:29.445
You know, look, just focus
on the success of your shop.


257
00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:31.322
Leave everything to us.

258
00:12:31.406 --> 00:12:33.992
I have a $50 bet on my date.

259
00:12:34.075 --> 00:12:35.535
Dad, I'm not some slot machine.

260
00:12:35.618 --> 00:12:36.953
Lia!

261
00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.746
Don't say 'slut'.

262
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.959
Look, your love line and career
line are intertwined.


263
00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:45.712
So when you find your husband,

264
00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:47.505
you will be
even more successful


265
00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:49.465
than you already are.

266
00:12:53.219 --> 00:12:55.680
Oh, are you?
Great. Yeah, good!


267
00:12:55.763 --> 00:12:57.056
Oh, my gosh, Lia,

268
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.684
do you remember Ezra
from Mum's Chinese school?


269
00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.687
- He is now a teacher!
- Oh!


270
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.980
Uh, yeah.

271
00:13:04.063 --> 00:13:05.106
Your mum couldn't
get rid of me.


272
00:13:06.274 --> 00:13:08.484
Michael here
is a restauranteur!


273
00:13:08.568 --> 00:13:11.029
Well, assistant manager
at Hungry Jacks,


274
00:13:11.112 --> 00:13:12.780
Townsville West, so...

275
00:13:12.864 --> 00:13:14.907
So, Michael,

276
00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:17.577
what's your
Hungry Jack's discount?


277
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.663
30% off when I'm working.

278
00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:22.832
But, you know, always working.

279
00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:25.793
Hey, you want to dance?

280
00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:27.962
- Oh, I'm a grinder.
- Oh, no, I don't dance.


281
00:13:28.046 --> 00:13:29.797
- Never, ever.
- There's a reason for it.


282
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:30.840
That's cool. That's cool.

283
00:13:30.923 --> 00:13:32.717
You just let me know
if you want to hook up later.


284
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.177
Oh.

285
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.511
You should go.

286
00:13:35.595 --> 00:13:36.888
You know what?

287
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:39.265
This party is full of
actual Townies


288
00:13:39.349 --> 00:13:42.101
and people I haven't seen
since high school.


289
00:13:42.185 --> 00:13:44.395
- Yeah...
- My soulmate is not here.


290
00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:46.564
Look, dating is just
a numbers game, you know?


291
00:13:46.648 --> 00:13:49.817
And your number
happens to be five.


292
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:52.487
- Five... That's a lot.
- Mm-hm.


293
00:13:54.113 --> 00:13:56.532
Oh, damn.

294
00:13:56.616 --> 00:13:59.702
Ship ahoy. Oh, my...

295
00:13:59.786 --> 00:14:01.329
- You know what?

296
00:14:01.412 --> 00:14:03.122
You should go
chase the Pink Panther.


297
00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:05.625
Wait! Oh, my God.
Is that Lia?


298
00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:07.001
-  Lia?

299
00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:08.711
Lia Ling!

300
00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:10.630
Hey! Mimi!

301
00:14:10.713 --> 00:14:13.758
- It's Mimi and Cici!
- Oh, Mimi and Cici!


302
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:15.510
- Oh, God, yes.
- Do you know what?


303
00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:19.263
You moving to Sydney
was so brave.


304
00:14:19.347 --> 00:14:20.807
It's really not
that incredible.


305
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.684
- It really is.
- Oh.


306
00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:25.687
Oh, I think I'm gonna...

307
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.939
- I'm gonna vomit.
- Oh! Oh, my God!


308
00:14:28.022 --> 00:14:30.692
- Sorry. Oh! Sorry.
- Careful. Watch yours...


309
00:14:31.984 --> 00:14:33.444
Richard.

310
00:14:34.987 --> 00:14:36.531
Oh, should I say Duckie?

311
00:14:38.324 --> 00:14:41.452
And,
"Why, am I Mr Pink?"


312
00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:44.122
Oh, thank God. 
Someone gets it.

313
00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:46.165
Yes!

314
00:14:46.249 --> 00:14:48.626
- Oh. Yeah.

315
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:49.794
- Um...
- Um...


316
00:14:49.877 --> 00:14:51.462
- Go.
- Um...


317
00:14:52.922 --> 00:14:54.298
It's been a while.

318
00:14:55.466 --> 00:14:56.551
Yeah.

319
00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:58.052
- On the house.
- Thank you.


320
00:14:59.387 --> 00:15:01.305
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


321
00:15:09.272 --> 00:15:11.065
It's good to see you.

322
00:15:11.149 --> 00:15:12.316
Mm-hm.

323
00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:16.320
I'm going to go find my friend.

324
00:15:16.404 --> 00:15:19.449
He's here and alone
and really shy.


325
00:15:19.532 --> 00:15:20.825
Is that him?

326
00:15:22.577 --> 00:15:24.245
Looks like your friend's
having a great time.


327
00:15:24.328 --> 00:15:26.080
Mm-hm. Yep.

328
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:30.251
OK. Well, thank you
for the drink.


329
00:15:32.253 --> 00:15:34.422
Hey, careful.

330
00:15:34.505 --> 00:15:35.923
Sorry.

331
00:15:36.007 --> 00:15:37.133
Oh, no, no. It's OK.

332
00:15:37.216 --> 00:15:39.594
I'm glad I'm on this side
of the pool now.


333
00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:41.137
Thank you.

334
00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:44.182
Still afraid of the water, huh?

335
00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:46.809
Mmm. If we we're meant to be
in the water, we'd have gills.


336
00:15:53.483 --> 00:15:55.193
- Hey...
- Mm-hm?


337
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.988
Jenga?

338
00:16:01.157 --> 00:16:02.784
Bold move.

339
00:16:02.867 --> 00:16:04.744
As I always do.

340
00:16:14.086 --> 00:16:16.005
Boringly cautious.

341
00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:18.508
Some would say risk-averse.

342
00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:24.305
You've changed.

343
00:16:26.182 --> 00:16:27.517
Have I?

344
00:16:29.936 --> 00:16:31.437
Different.

345
00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:35.149
But the same.

346
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:40.238
Everything's really good,
by the way.


347
00:16:40.321 --> 00:16:44.867
You know, we're thinking of
opening a third location...


348
00:16:45.868 --> 00:16:47.870
...for the family restaurant.

349
00:16:47.954 --> 00:16:49.997
We're thinking...

350
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:51.040
Sydney.

351
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:53.334
Oh!

352
00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:56.420
Jenga.

353
00:16:56.504 --> 00:16:57.713
Is it really a win, though,

354
00:16:57.797 --> 00:17:00.174
if you never even
took a chance?


355
00:17:01.217 --> 00:17:03.010
The rules are the rules.

356
00:17:03.094 --> 00:17:05.638
So who invited you?

357
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:08.140
Alice didn't tell you?

358
00:17:08.224 --> 00:17:09.892
Look at you two!

359
00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:12.854
The maid of honour,
and the best man.


360
00:17:12.937 --> 00:17:14.522
Best man?

361
00:17:14.605 --> 00:17:17.400
Did you not read my 20-page
wedding handbook I sent you?


362
00:17:18.985 --> 00:17:20.444
Oh, uh...

363
00:17:20.528 --> 00:17:22.822
Yes. I skimmed it.

364
00:17:22.905 --> 00:17:24.949
It said if you had
any questions,


365
00:17:25.032 --> 00:17:26.534
comments or concerns,

366
00:17:26.617 --> 00:17:28.119
please let me know.

367
00:17:28.202 --> 00:17:30.037
- We're good.
- Good!


368
00:17:30.121 --> 00:17:33.040
OK. I'm going to go find
my Pink Lady friend.


369
00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:36.460
Thank you.

370
00:17:36.544 --> 00:17:38.045
You know what? Yeah.

Oh. Oh, God.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.589
OK.

394
00:19:03.673 --> 00:19:05.174
-  Oh.
- I'm fine.


395
00:19:05.257 --> 00:19:07.760
You weren't heavy.

396
00:19:09.053 --> 00:19:10.680
Did we...?

397
00:19:10.763 --> 00:19:11.973
Oh. Oh, God, no.

398
00:19:12.056 --> 00:19:14.642
- No. OK, good.
- No, no, no.


399
00:19:16.644 --> 00:19:18.646
How, uh, did I...?

400
00:19:18.729 --> 00:19:22.066
Your Pink Lady friend Mason
tried to take you home,


401
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:23.651
but you insisted

402
00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:26.570
you shut down the club
'cause you're a party animal.


403
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:29.573
- Mm-hm.
- Anyway...


404
00:19:29.657 --> 00:19:31.659
Your phone was dead.

405
00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:33.828
I don't know where you belong.

406
00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:36.330
- Mm-hm.
- So I just slept on the floor.


407
00:19:45.506 --> 00:19:47.091
Are you staring at my body?

408
00:19:47.174 --> 00:19:48.551
No.

409
00:19:48.634 --> 00:19:50.094
Don't flatter yourself.

410
00:19:51.637 --> 00:19:53.848
It was a lot quieter
here in Townsville without you.


411
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:55.683
I'm glad you're killing it.

412
00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:58.102
And I'm sure your grandma
would be proud of you.


413
00:19:59.186 --> 00:20:01.981
Probably a big-city date
to the wedding.


414
00:20:02.064 --> 00:20:04.984
But, you know,
in case he can't make it,


415
00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:09.321
I'll see you
at the lonely hearts table.


416
00:20:09.405 --> 00:20:11.741
Actually, I have a date.

417
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.619
S... So there is someone.

418
00:20:15.703 --> 00:20:18.289
Uh-huh. You'll... meet him...

419
00:20:19.832 --> 00:20:21.625
You'll meet him at the wedding.

420
00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:24.336
Oh, maybe I'll meet him
in Sydney


421
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.880
for the suit fittings.

422
00:20:25.963 --> 00:20:27.715
Suit fittings?

423
00:20:27.798 --> 00:20:30.092
Page 9 in Alice's
wedding manual.


424
00:20:31.552 --> 00:20:32.970
Right? Yes. Of course.

425
00:20:33.054 --> 00:20:34.889
Page 9, suit fittings.

426
00:20:34.972 --> 00:20:36.766
- Oh, God, Mason.

427
00:20:36.849 --> 00:20:40.269
OK, so Townsville actually has
a lot of cute brunch plates.


428
00:20:40.352 --> 00:20:42.271
Not important.
Mason, I need your help.


429
00:20:42.354 --> 00:20:44.607
Oh, do we need to go into town
to get a little pill?


430
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.233
I did not sleep with Richard.

431
00:20:46.317 --> 00:20:48.319
OK. And I believe you.

432
00:20:48.402 --> 00:20:50.196
But do we need to go?

433
00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:52.031
If I come back here
for Alice's wedding


434
00:20:52.114 --> 00:20:54.158
with no date
and a failed tea shop,


435
00:20:54.241 --> 00:20:56.035
I will never
hear the end of it.


436
00:20:56.118 --> 00:20:58.454
- Mm-hm.
- So...


437
00:20:58.537 --> 00:21:00.664
I have five blind dates
to go on.


438
00:21:02.792 --> 00:21:04.293
Great!

439
00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:07.296
Hey, so you didn't do
any over-the-pants stuff?


440
00:21:07.379 --> 00:21:08.923
No, Mason! That is disgusting.

441
00:21:09.006 --> 00:21:10.674
What? OK.

442
00:21:10.758 --> 00:21:13.219
Alright, I'm ready.

443
00:21:13.302 --> 00:21:14.637
OK.

444
00:21:16.138 --> 00:21:17.473
Cares about others...

445
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.684
Oh, you read my mind.

446
00:21:20.768 --> 00:21:23.437
Very good hair. OK, fine.

447
00:21:36.325 --> 00:21:37.618
Must like tea.

448
00:21:44.208 --> 00:21:46.585
Oh. Good.

449
00:21:49.922 --> 00:21:53.801
Two. Three. Four.

450
00:21:54.802 --> 00:21:55.886
Wow.

451
00:22:01.183 --> 00:22:02.351
So cute!

452
00:22:02.434 --> 00:22:05.938
Let me give you
a gay-bestie makeover.


453
00:22:06.021 --> 00:22:07.606
Mm-mm. I'm going as me.

454
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.714
-  <i>Hello?</i>

455
00:22:31.797 --> 00:22:34.008
Mason, I need you
to pick me up.


456
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:36.093
I think my dad set me up
to have my organs harvested.


457
00:22:36.177 --> 00:22:38.596
Wait! Stay by your phone.

458
00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:41.056
<i>Kidding!
You got my voicemail, boo.</i>


459
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.017
<i>- Just leave a message.</i>
- Dammit.


460
00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:56.280
-  <i>Hello?</i>

461
00:22:56.363 --> 00:22:58.073
Hey.

462
00:22:58.157 --> 00:23:00.659
Hey, if I die,
play Dami Im at my funeral.


463
00:23:00.743 --> 00:23:02.203
Also, delete my browser history

464
00:23:02.286 --> 00:23:04.288
and clean out
my top dresser drawer.


465
00:23:04.371 --> 00:23:07.041
<i>Kidding!
You got my voicemail, boo.</i>


466
00:23:07.124 --> 00:23:09.251
How do I keep falling for that?

467
00:23:13.589 --> 00:23:15.049
Hi. Is...

468
00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:16.550
I can't let you in.

469
00:23:16.634 --> 00:23:18.928
- What?
- We have a dress code.


470
00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:20.679
I'm dressed.

471
00:23:20.763 --> 00:23:22.431
To work at Cotton On?

472
00:23:22.514 --> 00:23:24.099
Oh. OK.

473
00:23:24.183 --> 00:23:27.436
Um, well, I had a date
with an Apollo Wang.


474
00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:29.855
Can you just tell him
I couldn't make it?


475
00:23:29.939 --> 00:23:32.733
<i>You</i> have a date
with Apollo Wang?


476
00:23:32.816 --> 00:23:34.860
Mm-hm.

477
00:23:34.944 --> 00:23:37.863
- LBD, stat.

478
00:23:37.947 --> 00:23:40.366
I think
she's a preschool teacher.


479
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:47.164
- Wow...

480
00:23:49.083 --> 00:23:50.251
Oh.

481
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:20.614
You found me.

482
00:24:24.243 --> 00:24:25.494
Apollo?

483
00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:26.662
Please.

484
00:24:28.914 --> 00:24:30.207
I heard you like tea.

485
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:32.876
So I had them create
a special cocktail


486
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.588
infused with the latest harvest
of original da hong pao.


487
00:24:36.672 --> 00:24:38.132
Da hong pao?

488
00:24:38.215 --> 00:24:39.425
Mm-hm.

489
00:24:50.978 --> 00:24:52.062
Holy moly!

490
00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:53.731
- This is...
- Captivating?


491
00:24:53.814 --> 00:24:56.150
Enticing?

492
00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:58.110
Heart-stopping?

493
00:24:58.193 --> 00:25:01.822
Mm-hm.

494
00:25:01.905 --> 00:25:04.616
Perfect way to settle
any blind-date nerves.


495
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.244
Of course. Yes. Dates can feel
somewhat transactional.


496
00:25:07.328 --> 00:25:09.455
- Much like a business.
- Yes.


497
00:25:10.497 --> 00:25:11.957
Speaking of business,

498
00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:14.168
do you have any plans
on Valentine's Day?


499
00:25:14.251 --> 00:25:19.256
Love a woman who's direct
and knows what she wants.


500
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.050
I have that in spades.

501
00:25:21.133 --> 00:25:22.885
So you don't think
a February wedding is too soon?


502
00:25:22.968 --> 00:25:24.470
There's no point in waiting,
is there?


503
00:25:24.553 --> 00:25:25.679
Fantastic!

504
00:25:25.763 --> 00:25:27.639
Well, it seems like
we're on the same page.


505
00:25:27.723 --> 00:25:29.058
You'll be my date to
my sister's wedding?


506
00:25:29.141 --> 00:25:30.267
You'll be my Australian wife.

507
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:32.770
- Wait, what?
- Hmm? N...


508
00:25:32.853 --> 00:25:34.355
Do you need
a permanent residency?


509
00:25:34.438 --> 00:25:36.815
No! No, no, no. Y...

510
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.651
We matched on Daya, right?

511
00:25:39.735 --> 00:25:42.696
The bougie dating app
for rich snobs?


512
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.906
There are other dating apps?

513
00:25:43.989 --> 00:25:45.157
L... Look, it doesn't matter.

514
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.787
You said you were looking
for a <i>certain arrangement.</i>


515
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.330
Yes.

516
00:25:51.413 --> 00:25:52.623
I already put an offer in

517
00:25:52.706 --> 00:25:55.709
on a very splendid property
in Vaucluse.


518
00:25:55.793 --> 00:25:57.878
That is to be our ostensible
primary residence.


519
00:25:57.961 --> 00:25:59.046
And meanwhile,

520
00:25:59.129 --> 00:26:01.423
my partners will be
living across the harbour.


521
00:26:01.507 --> 00:26:02.591
Uh... I'm sorry.

522
00:26:02.674 --> 00:26:05.052
Why should it matter where
your business partners live?


523
00:26:05.135 --> 00:26:07.596
Not my business partners, Lia.

524
00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:09.640
My life partners.

525
00:26:09.723 --> 00:26:12.226
I'm sorry.
I feel like I missed a step.


526
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:15.604
It is customary
for a Chinese businessman


527
00:26:15.687 --> 00:26:16.939
to have a mistress,

528
00:26:17.022 --> 00:26:19.525
<i>or</i> a mister,

529
00:26:19.608 --> 00:26:22.236
or both.

530
00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:24.405
Oh.

531
00:26:24.488 --> 00:26:27.074
You did say
you were non-traditional.


532
00:26:27.157 --> 00:26:30.577
Ooh...
I meant taking a stranger


533
00:26:30.661 --> 00:26:32.538
to my sister's wedding.

534
00:26:34.456 --> 00:26:35.999
We can still fold this
into the original plan.


535
00:26:37.376 --> 00:26:38.961
Let me show you what I mean.

536
00:26:41.213 --> 00:26:43.549
Now, if you'd
rather be closer to the action,


537
00:26:43.632 --> 00:26:47.511
we could have this as
our secondary city residence.


538
00:26:47.594 --> 00:26:50.806
I'd want you to feel quite at
home in our little backwater.


539
00:26:50.889 --> 00:26:55.352
I couldn't imagine waking up
to this every morning.


540
00:26:56.603 --> 00:26:57.896
Come.

541
00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:01.859
You will be
my front-facing wife.


542
00:27:01.942 --> 00:27:03.694
You'll accompany me to
business meetings


543
00:27:03.777 --> 00:27:06.196
and quarterly visits
to see my parents in China.


544
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.574
And in return,
I'll give you an allowance


545
00:27:08.657 --> 00:27:11.618
and the freedom
to do with it what you will.


546
00:27:13.162 --> 00:27:14.788
Wow. OK.

547
00:27:18.459 --> 00:27:21.086
Just out of curiosity,

548
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.088
how much is the allowance?

549
00:27:23.172 --> 00:27:25.632
Actually, no,
that wouldn't be right.


550
00:27:25.716 --> 00:27:27.176
What it wouldn't be right?

551
00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:29.136
I can support myself.

552
00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:30.637
I own a tea shop.

553
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:32.139
Oh, adorable.

554
00:27:32.222 --> 00:27:34.433
Please help yourself.

555
00:27:34.516 --> 00:27:36.477
Oh.

556
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.769
Thank you.

557
00:27:37.853 --> 00:27:40.564
In six months, we'll begin
trying for children.


558
00:27:41.857 --> 00:27:43.484
Feel free to
keep running your tea shop.


559
00:27:43.567 --> 00:27:45.110
Three sons, minimum.

560
00:27:50.324 --> 00:27:51.909
Um...

561
00:27:53.243 --> 00:27:55.954
Have you never met someone

562
00:27:56.038 --> 00:27:58.040
that you wanted to
settle down with?


563
00:27:58.123 --> 00:27:59.374
Like, solo?

564
00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:01.627
Well, I believe that there's

565
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.672
more than one soulmate
out there for everybody.


566
00:28:05.756 --> 00:28:08.342
That is something that
we, collectively,


567
00:28:08.425 --> 00:28:09.801
can explore together.

568
00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:12.930
Even if
we don't <i>love</i> each other?


569
00:28:13.013 --> 00:28:14.848
Well, love fades.

570
00:28:14.932 --> 00:28:16.183
Investments are forever,

571
00:28:16.266 --> 00:28:19.144
and investments
should be diversified.


572
00:28:20.896 --> 00:28:22.147
Hmm.

573
00:28:35.744 --> 00:28:37.287
Theoretically...

574
00:28:39.414 --> 00:28:42.918
...it might be something
that would work well for me.


575
00:28:43.001 --> 00:28:45.212
But...?

576
00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:46.964
But...

577
00:28:48.382 --> 00:28:50.259
...maybe there's
more tradition in me


578
00:28:50.342 --> 00:28:51.802
than I thought.

579
00:28:54.596 --> 00:28:56.014
Disappointing.

580
00:28:56.098 --> 00:28:59.851
But, if you still need a date
to your sister's wedding,


581
00:28:59.935 --> 00:29:02.187
give me a call and I'll
fly the private jet out.


582
00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:03.897
Feel free to stay for dessert.

583
00:29:03.981 --> 00:29:09.903
But I do have another candidate
coming in a half... hour.


584
00:29:09.987 --> 00:29:11.446
Oh.

585
00:29:14.032 --> 00:29:17.869
- What's for dessert?
- Literally anything.


586
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.711
<i>Locked and loaded
on the first date.</i>


587
00:29:25.794 --> 00:29:28.880
I told you I nailed it.
Come on.


588
00:29:28.964 --> 00:29:30.507
You didn't even
thumbtack it, Dad.


589
00:29:30.591 --> 00:29:33.135
<i>He's exactly the guy you need!</i>

590
00:29:33.218 --> 00:29:34.720
<i>The only heir</i>

591
00:29:34.803 --> 00:29:37.514
to a multibillion-dollar
tech company.


592
00:29:37.598 --> 00:29:39.808
<i>And you'd give him
what he wants.</i>


593
00:29:39.891 --> 00:29:41.852
Uh-huh. What is that?

594
00:29:41.935 --> 00:29:43.353
Freedom.

595
00:29:43.437 --> 00:29:45.230
- Hold on.

596
00:29:45.314 --> 00:29:47.065
Alice is calling me.
I got to go.


597
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:48.692
Love you! Mwah, mwah, mwah!

598
00:29:48.775 --> 00:29:50.068
K, bye.

599
00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:54.990
- Hello, Alice.
- How's my gorgeous big sister?


600
00:29:55.073 --> 00:29:56.450
What do you need?

601
00:29:56.533 --> 00:29:58.994
I just wanted to see
how your date went.


602
00:29:59.077 --> 00:30:00.662
How did Dad do?

603
00:30:00.746 --> 00:30:02.039
Yeah, it was fine.

604
00:30:02.122 --> 00:30:03.707
Uh, it was very
Crazy Rich Asians...


605
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.917
Look, I want to check
on the bonbonnieres.


606
00:30:06.001 --> 00:30:07.210
The what?

607
00:30:07.294 --> 00:30:09.838
Page 12 of the wedding manual.

608
00:30:09.921 --> 00:30:11.965
Oh, yes, of course.

609
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:14.009
It's only 120 people.

610
00:30:14.092 --> 00:30:16.094
120 people?

611
00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:18.305
That could be, like,
hundreds of dollars.


612
00:30:18.388 --> 00:30:20.515
Thank you!
You're the best!


613
00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:22.726
- Oh, my...

614
00:30:34.237 --> 00:30:36.657
- Hi. Would you like a sample?
- Sorry.


615
00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.575
- Hi. Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.


616
00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:40.410
Have a good day.

617
00:30:40.494 --> 00:30:42.579
- Well?

618
00:30:43.622 --> 00:30:45.582
- You're right.
- I know I am.


619
00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:46.792
About what?

620
00:30:46.875 --> 00:30:48.335
If there's even a chance

621
00:30:48.418 --> 00:30:50.087
that finding my soulmate
will save the shop,


622
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.672
I need to take it seriously.

623
00:30:51.755 --> 00:30:53.507
So...?

624
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.175
I need you to fix me up.

625
00:30:55.258 --> 00:30:56.843
Yes!

626
00:30:56.927 --> 00:31:01.056
Oh, thank God. Gay Jesus
has answered my prayers.

00:32:41.573 --> 00:32:43.408
Lia?

664
00:32:43.492 --> 00:32:46.203
Ezra! What are you doing here?

665
00:32:46.286 --> 00:32:47.996
Oh! What are <i>you</i> doing here?

666
00:32:49.623 --> 00:32:52.125
I'm just waiting
for a date, actually.


667
00:32:52.209 --> 00:32:54.336
Ah. Um...

668
00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:56.129
I believe I am that date.

669
00:32:57.631 --> 00:32:59.049
Is that OK?

670
00:32:59.132 --> 00:33:00.550
Uh-huh.

671
00:33:02.928 --> 00:33:05.639
Did my mum send you here
to lure me back to Townsville?


672
00:33:05.722 --> 00:33:08.475
I hope
she didn't use me as bait.


673
00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:11.102
Although,
I do love fly fishing.


674
00:33:11.186 --> 00:33:13.855
You're like a 50-year-old man
in a 30-year-old body.


675
00:33:13.939 --> 00:33:15.398
Mmm. What can I say?

676
00:33:15.482 --> 00:33:16.983
I like old things.

677
00:33:17.067 --> 00:33:20.195
Something comforting
about traditional.


678
00:33:21.238 --> 00:33:23.073
I feel the exact same way.

679
00:33:27.202 --> 00:33:28.703
Have you foraged before?

680
00:33:30.497 --> 00:33:32.374
Try this.
Let me know what you think.


681
00:33:33.583 --> 00:33:34.751
Mmm.

682
00:33:34.835 --> 00:33:36.670
Buzzy on the nose.

683
00:33:36.753 --> 00:33:40.507
Kind of like
an early morning swim.


684
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.800
Mm-hm.

685
00:33:41.883 --> 00:33:44.052
But then mellow on the back.

686
00:33:44.135 --> 00:33:45.762
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Mmm.


687
00:33:45.846 --> 00:33:47.931
- Yeah.

688
00:33:49.015 --> 00:33:51.393
Ooh! Those are my favourite.

689
00:33:51.476 --> 00:33:53.895
It's a de-stressor.

690
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.691
- Here. You have to try it.
- OK.


691
00:33:57.774 --> 00:33:59.568
It's apparently really good

692
00:33:59.651 --> 00:34:02.571
for brain function,
anti-swelling.


693
00:34:02.654 --> 00:34:04.531
Kind of tastes like, uh...

694
00:34:04.614 --> 00:34:06.324
- A bit like dirt, right?
-  Yeah.


695
00:34:06.408 --> 00:34:08.493
I wasn't going to say it.

696
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.663
- Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

697
00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:13.164
This has turned into
a work trip.


698
00:34:13.248 --> 00:34:14.958
- That's so embarrassing.
- Um...


699
00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:16.334
What did you say
this was, again?


700
00:34:16.418 --> 00:34:17.794
- Ashwagandha.
- Mmm.


701
00:34:17.878 --> 00:34:20.547
It's commonly used
in Asia, Africa,


702
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.966
and part of
the nightshade family.


703
00:34:23.049 --> 00:34:25.343
Uh, what was
that last part you said?


704
00:34:25.427 --> 00:34:27.262
- A nightshade?
- Oh.


705
00:34:27.345 --> 00:34:28.847
I thought nightshades were only

706
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:33.059
potatoes, tomatoes and...
...capsicums.


707
00:34:33.143 --> 00:34:37.355
Yes, but ashwagandha
also bears wild cherries.


708
00:34:37.439 --> 00:34:40.817
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm actually quite allergic.


709
00:34:40.901 --> 00:34:42.694
- Oh. Oh, my gosh.

710
00:34:42.777 --> 00:34:44.321
-  Can I help?

711
00:34:44.404 --> 00:34:46.031
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

712
00:34:46.114 --> 00:34:48.408
No! Agh!

713
00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:50.368
What is happening?
How do I help?


714
00:34:50.452 --> 00:34:51.953
- A... Adrenaline.
- Oh!


715
00:34:52.037 --> 00:34:53.747
- Jacket.
- The jacket! Oh!


716
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.000
Can you please help!
Someone help! He's allergic!


717
00:34:57.083 --> 00:34:58.084
Agh!

718
00:34:58.168 --> 00:34:59.711
Agh! I can't find the pen!

719
00:34:59.794 --> 00:35:00.921
What does it look like?

720
00:35:01.004 --> 00:35:03.548
Oh, my God.
OK, so it's pull off...


721
00:35:03.632 --> 00:35:05.467
OK.
Stab me. Stab me!


722
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.927
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Stab me!


723
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.969
- Where do I stab you?
- Stab me!


724
00:35:08.053 --> 00:35:09.596
How hard do I stab you?
Stab me!


725
00:35:13.642 --> 00:35:15.560
Ugh...

726
00:35:15.644 --> 00:35:16.728
Whoo...

727
00:35:16.811 --> 00:35:18.730
Did it work?

728
00:35:18.813 --> 00:35:20.523
Ha...

729
00:35:20.607 --> 00:35:22.108
I'm... I'm so sorry.

730
00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:23.485
Oh, no, no, no, no, please.

731
00:35:23.568 --> 00:35:28.573
This is the most excitement
I've had since, like...


732
00:35:28.657 --> 00:35:30.533
Oh, yeah, since, like, ever.

733
00:35:30.617 --> 00:35:31.826
That's a relief.

734
00:35:34.287 --> 00:35:36.790
The cafe said
it's just an Earl Grey.


735
00:35:42.587 --> 00:35:45.924
So, not to get into
anything too personal,


736
00:35:46.007 --> 00:35:48.009
but your mum did say
she would love it


737
00:35:48.093 --> 00:35:51.221
if you came back home
and helped her run the school.


738
00:35:51.304 --> 00:35:53.306
Mmm. Of course she did.

739
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.643
Do you think at some point
you'd want to go back...


740
00:35:57.936 --> 00:35:59.020
...be with your family?

741
00:36:05.652 --> 00:36:07.737
Before my grandma passed,

742
00:36:07.821 --> 00:36:10.699
she told me
to follow my dreams.


743
00:36:12.784 --> 00:36:15.829
Coming here to Sydney alone...

744
00:36:15.912 --> 00:36:19.332
it was one of the scariest
things I've ever done.


745
00:36:24.587 --> 00:36:27.674
When my family
moved back home to Indonesia...


746
00:36:29.592 --> 00:36:32.679
...I was so lonely that
I'd talk to myself.


747
00:36:34.597 --> 00:36:36.307
God, that's embarrassing.

748
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.728
No, it isn't.

749
00:36:49.112 --> 00:36:50.613
That was brave.

750
00:36:50.697 --> 00:36:52.198
The move.

751
00:36:52.282 --> 00:36:53.825
But the kiss also.

752
00:36:53.908 --> 00:36:55.368
I...

753
00:36:59.831 --> 00:37:02.083
Uh, I don't usually do this
until, like, the second date.


754
00:37:02.167 --> 00:37:03.418
Some traditions
are made to be broken.


755
00:37:03.501 --> 00:37:04.502
Yeah.

756
00:37:12.469 --> 00:37:14.304
Mmm. Oh, Jing...

757
00:37:15.764 --> 00:37:17.515
- Ooh...
- Did you...?


758
00:37:19.142 --> 00:37:20.310
- Oh! Did...
- No, I didn't...


759
00:37:20.393 --> 00:37:21.728
You just said my mum's name!

760
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:23.146
I didn't say anything!

761
00:37:23.229 --> 00:37:25.023
- Yeah, you did.
- No, no, I said... I said...


762
00:37:25.106 --> 00:37:26.775
I said, "ka-ching!"
K... Ka-ching.


763
00:37:26.858 --> 00:37:30.487
-  That was...
- Oh, my God!


764
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:33.448
- This entire date...
- W... What?


765
00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:35.617
What? We're enjoying
ourselves, aren't we?


766
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.452
I thought we were, but...

767
00:37:37.535 --> 00:37:39.704
...but this is
the exact same date


768
00:37:39.788 --> 00:37:41.206
my mum would have
wanted to go on.


769
00:37:41.289 --> 00:37:43.208
Wh...! How am I
meant to know that?


770
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:45.794
W... Besides talking to her
every day after class?


771
00:37:45.877 --> 00:37:47.587
Well, and sometimes
after lunch.


772
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.797
Oh, and sometimes after dinner.

773
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.465
- Oh, my God!
- Ah...


774
00:37:50.548 --> 00:37:52.175
Are you hearing yourself?

775
00:37:53.343 --> 00:37:54.844
Look...

776
00:37:54.928 --> 00:37:57.514
Your mother
is an incredible woman,


777
00:37:57.597 --> 00:37:58.890
and so are you.

778
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:04.270
You really are a 50-year-old
in a 30-year-old body.


779
00:38:04.354 --> 00:38:06.481
And you have feelings
for a 50-year-old


780
00:38:06.564 --> 00:38:08.191
in a 50-year-old's body.

781
00:38:08.274 --> 00:38:09.734
- OK, well...
- You know what?


782
00:38:09.818 --> 00:38:11.444
No... Hey!

783
00:38:11.528 --> 00:38:13.196
-  So...

784
00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:15.990
it was the perfect date,

785
00:38:16.074 --> 00:38:17.367
but you stabbed him.

786
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.409
Mm-hm.

787
00:38:18.493 --> 00:38:20.912
Once to save his life,
twice to end it.


788
00:38:20.995 --> 00:38:22.080
Ugh.

789
00:38:22.163 --> 00:38:24.124
Like I don't have
enough mummy issues.


790
00:38:24.207 --> 00:38:26.626
You know me, boo.
I don't kink-shame


791
00:38:26.709 --> 00:38:30.672
but straight people...

792
00:38:30.755 --> 00:38:31.965
...are wild.

793
00:38:40.431 --> 00:38:41.975
Mm! Mmm...

794
00:38:42.058 --> 00:38:43.726
It is downright impossible

795
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.812
to run a business
and find a soul mate


796
00:38:45.895 --> 00:38:48.064
full-time, at the same time.

797
00:38:48.148 --> 00:38:49.399
That's why
people on The Bachelor


798
00:38:49.482 --> 00:38:50.483
put their lives on hold

799
00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:51.818
and live in a mansion
for two months.


800
00:38:51.901 --> 00:38:54.070
So you're not ruling out
The Bachelor?


801
00:38:54.154 --> 00:38:55.196
Ugh.

802
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.117
I tried to be open,
and look where it got me.


803
00:39:00.285 --> 00:39:02.495
Why can't the person
I'm supposed to be with


804
00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:03.955
just walk through those doors?

805
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.336
Oh!

806
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.172
- So cute.
- Eh.


807
00:39:18.636 --> 00:39:20.054
Oh!

808
00:39:20.138 --> 00:39:21.306
-  Oh.
- Yeah!


809
00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:23.808
Yay!

810
00:39:23.892 --> 00:39:25.226
Thank you!

811
00:39:29.397 --> 00:39:30.565
- So cute.
- It was so cute.


812
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.276
Richard?

813
00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:35.069
How cool was that?

814
00:39:38.656 --> 00:39:40.200
By the confused look
on your face,


815
00:39:40.283 --> 00:39:43.077
I'm guessing you didn't read
page 12 of the manual.


816
00:39:44.245 --> 00:39:46.247
"As a symbol of our union

817
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:48.291
the best man
and the maid of honour


818
00:39:48.374 --> 00:39:51.252
are to provide bonbonnieres
together.


819
00:39:51.336 --> 00:39:53.087
Together?

820
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:54.797
Together, of course. Yes.

821
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:58.343
Uh, I just didn't
read the fine print.


822
00:40:01.846 --> 00:40:03.056
Wow.

823
00:40:11.439 --> 00:40:13.316
I... pictured it differently.

824
00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:15.485
Oh, yeah.

825
00:40:15.568 --> 00:40:17.320
We just finished
the morning rush,


826
00:40:17.403 --> 00:40:21.241
and usually there's a lull
for about an hour.


827
00:40:21.324 --> 00:40:23.534
Or three, or four.

828
00:40:30.708 --> 00:40:33.127
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


829
00:40:43.972 --> 00:40:45.723
Let me guess.

830
00:40:45.807 --> 00:40:48.559
Tea from Chaozhou?

831
00:40:49.727 --> 00:40:51.521
How did you know?

832
00:40:51.604 --> 00:40:53.273
Lia, it's your grandma's tea.

833
00:40:53.356 --> 00:40:56.859
How could I forget?

834
00:40:56.943 --> 00:41:00.530
OK, I'm just going to check
the inventory in the back.


835
00:41:00.613 --> 00:41:02.865
So are you going to tell me
who you're taking to the wedding?


836
00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:05.118
Actually, you know what? I could
start with the inventory out here.


837
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:07.120
No, you can start with
the inventory in the back.


838
00:41:11.291 --> 00:41:14.252
I actually have a few options.

839
00:41:14.335 --> 00:41:16.963
I'm just deciding between them.

840
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.261
Look at us.
Just like old times.


841
00:41:23.344 --> 00:41:25.972
Let's just get this done,
please!


842
00:41:26.055 --> 00:41:27.765
Right.

843
00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:32.186
Well, I was thinking
candles with their initials


844
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.188
so that people can light them
up halfway through the night.


845
00:41:34.272 --> 00:41:36.733
Hmm. So that Nigel's drunk dad

846
00:41:36.816 --> 00:41:38.901
can also burn down
the entire venue.


847
00:41:38.985 --> 00:41:41.988
OK, well, then,
electric lights.


848
00:41:42.071 --> 00:41:44.032
So wasteful.

849
00:41:45.074 --> 00:41:46.743
So, what are your ideas, genius?

850
00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:49.746
Tea satchels.

851
00:41:56.044 --> 00:41:58.296
There hasn't been
a single customer


852
00:41:58.379 --> 00:42:00.006
since I've been in here.

853
00:42:00.089 --> 00:42:02.175
Yeah, it's a really
quiet time of the day.


854
00:42:02.258 --> 00:42:05.511
Ha!

855
00:42:05.595 --> 00:42:07.096
Could you afford to
provide tea


856
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.057
for that many people?

857
00:42:10.099 --> 00:42:11.851
You know what?

858
00:42:11.934 --> 00:42:13.144
I can finish these later,

859
00:42:13.227 --> 00:42:15.313
and we can just ask Alice
what she wants.


860
00:42:15.396 --> 00:42:17.023
Wait, Alice specifically said

861
00:42:17.106 --> 00:42:19.442
that she wanted the best man
and maid of honour


862
00:42:19.525 --> 00:42:21.903
- to do the bonbonnieres.
- Yes, well...


863
00:42:21.986 --> 00:42:23.154
You don't know my sister
like I do.


864
00:42:23.237 --> 00:42:24.280
No, I don't. But she said...

865
00:42:24.364 --> 00:42:26.866
Yeah, well, sometimes what
she says is not what she means.


866
00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:29.535
I guess that
runs in the family.


867
00:42:29.619 --> 00:42:31.662
What is that supposed to mean?

868
00:42:32.747 --> 00:42:34.248
You know what?

869
00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:37.210
Forget it. Um...

870
00:42:37.293 --> 00:42:38.920
Thanks for the tea.

871
00:42:39.003 --> 00:42:40.546
I'll see you tomorrow.

872
00:42:47.136 --> 00:42:49.722
Ooh!

873
00:42:49.806 --> 00:42:51.724
OK.

874
00:42:51.808 --> 00:42:52.975
Starting to see now

875
00:42:53.059 --> 00:42:55.395
why things didn't work out
with Mr Hottie and you.


876
00:42:55.478 --> 00:42:57.522
Because he's an arsehole.

877
00:42:57.605 --> 00:43:01.109
No, it's because
you're the same person.


878
00:43:01.192 --> 00:43:03.236
Well, lucky for me,

879
00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:06.322
there are plenty of fish
in the sea...


880
00:43:06.406 --> 00:43:07.824
to see.

881
00:43:15.206 --> 00:43:17.917
<i>♪ Well, you've caught me
right on time ♪</i>


882
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.130
<i>♪ So for now
let's enjoy the sunshine...</i>


883
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:24.799
Whoo!

884
00:43:24.882 --> 00:43:26.884
Spa splash day!

885
00:43:26.968 --> 00:43:29.262
Ooh! I can't wait!

886
00:43:29.345 --> 00:43:31.055
- I'm so excited.
- Lia!


887
00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:33.182
- Ah!
- Oh.


888
00:43:33.266 --> 00:43:35.476
Hey, Richard.

889
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.270
Hey.

890
00:43:37.353 --> 00:43:38.980
Oh, Lia, this is Rosie.

891
00:43:39.063 --> 00:43:40.398
Uh, she's...

892
00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:42.108
- His date.

893
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:44.777
Well, Rosie's actually part of
the bridal party,


894
00:43:44.861 --> 00:43:46.154
and she's Nigel's cousin.

895
00:43:46.237 --> 00:43:47.655
But we thought
since we're coming together,


896
00:43:47.738 --> 00:43:49.115
we might as well
be a date, right?


897
00:43:49.198 --> 00:43:51.075
- Oh, great.

898
00:43:52.577 --> 00:43:53.744
Lia!

899
00:43:53.828 --> 00:43:55.246
Oh, let's head down.

900
00:43:55.329 --> 00:43:58.124
The waves are gorgeous.
Oh, my God!


901
00:43:59.709 --> 00:44:00.877
And there's Curtis,

902
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.211
who could be your partner
to the wedding


903
00:44:02.295 --> 00:44:03.671
if you play your cards right.

904
00:44:03.754 --> 00:44:05.756
- Heyo!
- Curtis!


905
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.508
Oh, Alice Ling!

906
00:44:07.592 --> 00:44:10.178
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh.


907
00:44:10.261 --> 00:44:11.762
It's so lovely
to see you again.


908
00:44:11.846 --> 00:44:15.475
Yes. Oh!
Um, Lia, this is Curtis.


909
00:44:15.558 --> 00:44:17.685
Curtis, this is my sister, Lia,

910
00:44:17.768 --> 00:44:19.729
who I've told you
so much about.


911
00:44:19.812 --> 00:44:21.689
Lia, you are even more
beautiful in person


912
00:44:21.772 --> 00:44:23.149
than Alice described.

913
00:44:23.232 --> 00:44:25.401
Oh! Thank you.

914
00:44:25.485 --> 00:44:27.153
It was kind of wild.

915
00:44:27.236 --> 00:44:28.905
This is Curtis, everyone!

916
00:44:28.988 --> 00:44:31.908
We met him in Cairns
at a meditation retreat.


917
00:44:31.991 --> 00:44:37.121
He helped us all find
an intense spiritual resonance.


918
00:44:37.205 --> 00:44:38.372
Hey, big guy!

919
00:44:38.456 --> 00:44:39.790
Um, Richard.

920
00:44:39.874 --> 00:44:41.584
Nice to meet you.

921
00:44:43.794 --> 00:44:45.963
Huh. Touchy guy, huh?

922
00:44:46.047 --> 00:44:49.133
Well, to be open
is to move without hesitation.


923
00:44:50.176 --> 00:44:51.677
So, Alice tells me

924
00:44:51.761 --> 00:44:53.763
you can be a little timid
in the water.


925
00:44:53.846 --> 00:44:58.267
I... I don't mind dipping
a toe or two in the water.


926
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:00.186
Well, if you're anything
like your sister,


927
00:45:00.269 --> 00:45:02.772
I know we'll have
a deep soul connection.


928
00:45:02.855 --> 00:45:03.898
Oh.

929
00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:06.150
Richard, can you,
uh, get my back?


930
00:45:06.234 --> 00:45:08.694
Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

931
00:45:14.116 --> 00:45:15.201
Curtis?

932
00:45:16.244 --> 00:45:17.286
Oh!

933
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:18.579
Ooh! Oh, my gosh.

934
00:45:18.663 --> 00:45:20.998
- Crap! I'm so sorry.
-  Don't be.


935
00:45:21.082 --> 00:45:22.792
It's exactly
where it's supposed to be.


936
00:45:22.875 --> 00:45:24.627
Help shield this mortal coil

937
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:27.171
from the rays
of this dying star.


938
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:30.967
Oh, yes. Of course.
Uh... Um...


939
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:37.890
Uh, just get that all over.

940
00:45:37.974 --> 00:45:40.518
OK. Uh, I finished.

941
00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:41.686
Thanks.

942
00:45:44.355 --> 00:45:48.859
Let that breeze kiss your skin.
Let your shoulders relax.


943
00:45:50.987 --> 00:45:53.447
Our bodies
and our minds are linked.


944
00:45:53.531 --> 00:45:56.784
If your body is tense,
your mind isn't at ease.


945
00:45:59.036 --> 00:46:01.372
Feel the blood pulse
to your fingertips,


946
00:46:01.455 --> 00:46:02.999
to your toes,

947
00:46:03.082 --> 00:46:05.710
every region of your body.

948
00:46:05.793 --> 00:46:07.587
Do you trust me?

949
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.505
- Uh...

950
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:10.798
Yes.

951
00:46:12.883 --> 00:46:15.886
We all live
on the precipice of fear.


952
00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.680
But beyond
the confines of that fear


953
00:46:17.763 --> 00:46:21.309
lies an endless world
of possibility, of fulfilment.


954
00:46:21.392 --> 00:46:23.853
- You just have to embrace it.

955
00:46:25.688 --> 00:46:27.481
- You've got this.

956
00:46:27.565 --> 00:46:30.401
- There you go.

957
00:46:31.777 --> 00:46:33.029
OK.

958
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.781
- OK.

959
00:46:37.617 --> 00:46:40.286
OK.

960
00:46:41.495 --> 00:46:43.331
Ooh!

961
00:46:43.414 --> 00:46:46.125
If you can't move past
the roadblocks in your mind,


962
00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:49.503
then those mental roadblocks
become physical roadblocks.


963
00:46:50.963 --> 00:46:53.424
- OK?
- OK. OK.


964
00:47:24.497 --> 00:47:26.707
- I did it!

965
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:28.417
I'm so proud of you!

966
00:47:46.644 --> 00:47:48.729
Well, I hope
you had a nice day.


967
00:47:48.813 --> 00:47:51.273
Looks like your date
with Curtis went well.


968
00:47:51.357 --> 00:47:53.776
- It did, didn't it?
- Hmm.


969
00:47:53.859 --> 00:47:55.486
So all it takes
to win over Lia Ling is


970
00:47:55.569 --> 00:47:58.406
a steady hand
and an impeccable jawline.


971
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:01.992
Are you jealous?

972
00:48:02.076 --> 00:48:03.244
Why would I be jealous

973
00:48:03.327 --> 00:48:04.954
of a 7-foot-tall
bronze meatball?


974
00:48:06.997 --> 00:48:08.499
I thought you'd be happy
for me.


975
00:48:08.582 --> 00:48:09.834
I can be happy for you

976
00:48:09.917 --> 00:48:12.920
and not agree with you
at the same time.


977
00:48:13.003 --> 00:48:14.588
Wow.

978
00:48:14.672 --> 00:48:17.758
The more things change,
the more things stay the same.


979
00:48:17.842 --> 00:48:19.093
What's that supposed to mean?

980
00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:21.137
Well, I was having
a great day today.


981
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.599
I relaxed for the first time
in, possibly, my entire life.


982
00:48:25.683 --> 00:48:27.101
And now, here we are,
going at it.


983
00:48:27.184 --> 00:48:29.145
You're the one
making this a thing.


984
00:48:29.228 --> 00:48:30.688
Me? I...

985
00:48:30.771 --> 00:48:32.815
You haven't even seen me
make the thing a thing.


986
00:48:32.898 --> 00:48:35.359
What...? Sorry.
What thing is this?


987
00:48:35.443 --> 00:48:36.736
The thing is, Rosie,

988
00:48:36.819 --> 00:48:38.195
we made a promise together

989
00:48:38.279 --> 00:48:39.655
to move to Sydney
to start a tea shop.


990
00:48:39.739 --> 00:48:41.323
But he pulled out
at the last second.


991
00:48:41.407 --> 00:48:43.617
- He what, now?
- So it's all my fault now?


992
00:48:43.701 --> 00:48:45.578
I sure as hell wasn't the one
that broke out pact.


993
00:48:45.661 --> 00:48:47.121
You know what? I forgot.

994
00:48:47.204 --> 00:48:50.291
The whole world only
revolves around Lia's dreams.


995
00:48:50.374 --> 00:48:51.500
We made a promise together.

996
00:48:51.584 --> 00:48:53.711
We made a promise
when we were 15 years old.


997
00:48:53.794 --> 00:48:55.629
It was a fantasy,
and one of us had to grow up.


998
00:48:55.713 --> 00:48:57.089
My parents needed me
to run the restaurant.


999
00:48:57.173 --> 00:48:59.383
What, are you trying to say that my
family didn't give a shit about me?


1000
00:48:59.467 --> 00:49:01.552
No, <i>you</i> didn't give a shit
about your family!


1001
00:49:03.387 --> 00:49:05.431
- Stop the car.
- Lia...


1002
00:49:05.514 --> 00:49:07.433
- Stop the goddamn car!

1003
00:49:14.482 --> 00:49:16.567
Lia. Lia!

1004
00:49:22.156 --> 00:49:25.785
Actually, right here
is fine for me too.


1005
00:49:26.744 --> 00:49:27.787
Rosie...

1006
00:49:36.378 --> 00:49:38.005
Forgot my bag.

1007
00:49:54.063 --> 00:49:55.481
Mmm!

1008
00:49:59.902 --> 00:50:01.445
Ohh...

1009
00:50:02.613 --> 00:50:03.906
Oh!

1010
00:50:07.159 --> 00:50:09.745
Oh! I love it.

1011
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:11.080
You look beautiful.

1012
00:50:11.163 --> 00:50:13.541
Well, for once,
we absolutely agree.


1013
00:50:13.624 --> 00:50:15.668
You are not even supposed
to be here.


1014
00:50:15.751 --> 00:50:17.253
Hey, I'm paying, I'm staying.

1015
00:50:17.336 --> 00:50:20.130
OK, let me try the other one.

1016
00:50:20.214 --> 00:50:23.384
We need to see them
side-by-side.


1017
00:50:23.467 --> 00:50:25.052
Lia, put on the other dress.

1018
00:50:25.135 --> 00:50:26.762
Well, isn't a bad luck?

1019
00:50:26.846 --> 00:50:29.056
Marriage is bad luck
in general.


1020
00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:31.016
No offence.

1021
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.727
Why don't we just take a photo,
and just compare...


1022
00:50:33.811 --> 00:50:35.187
on the phone?

1023
00:50:36.856 --> 00:50:40.067
Or I can try it on.

1024
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:43.988
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.


1025
00:50:57.668 --> 00:50:58.919
Oh!

1026
00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:04.842
Lia!

1027
00:51:07.553 --> 00:51:10.139
Oh, my gosh! Oh...

1028
00:51:13.684 --> 00:51:15.185
Oh!

1029
00:51:15.269 --> 00:51:18.522
Oh, I literally can't choose!

1030
00:51:20.816 --> 00:51:24.945
To think both of my daughters
will be married in a year.


1031
00:51:25.029 --> 00:51:27.323
What did you think of Curtis?

1032
00:51:27.406 --> 00:51:30.743
Curtis was...
an experience,


1033
00:51:32.244 --> 00:51:34.663
...but I don't know
if he's the one.


1034
00:51:34.747 --> 00:51:36.081
What do you mean?

1035
00:51:36.165 --> 00:51:38.876
He was, like John the Baptist
getting you into the water.


1036
00:51:38.959 --> 00:51:40.628
Honestly, Lia,

1037
00:51:40.711 --> 00:51:43.088
I feel sorry for the men.

1038
00:51:43.172 --> 00:51:45.841
And are you even trying?

1039
00:51:46.926 --> 00:51:49.261
Look, I think Ezra would
make a wonderful husband.


1040
00:51:49.345 --> 00:51:50.930
Yes, someone's husband.

1041
00:51:51.013 --> 00:51:52.890
She doesn't need a bookworm.

1042
00:51:52.973 --> 00:51:54.725
I tell you what, she needs...

1043
00:51:54.808 --> 00:51:56.310
- A piggybank? Hmm?
- What?


1044
00:51:56.393 --> 00:51:58.729
You think I did not hear
who you set her up with?


1045
00:51:58.812 --> 00:52:00.189
- It's business.
- No!


1046
00:52:00.272 --> 00:52:02.566
Lia needs someone simple.

1047
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:03.817
I think I just need to not...

1048
00:52:03.901 --> 00:52:06.862
She needs someone who can
take responsibility seriously.


1049
00:52:06.946 --> 00:52:09.239
So you don't think
Apollo's money is serious?


1050
00:52:09.323 --> 00:52:10.240
No!

1051
00:52:10.324 --> 00:52:11.992
I'm not just something
to be given away.


1052
00:52:12.076 --> 00:52:14.036
Inside voices, please!

1053
00:52:14.119 --> 00:52:15.496
Alice, this is a joke.

1054
00:52:15.579 --> 00:52:17.539
Apollo doesn't even
believe in love.


1055
00:52:17.623 --> 00:52:18.666
But that's the point!

1056
00:52:18.749 --> 00:52:20.292
Curtis is more dolphin
than man.


1057
00:52:20.376 --> 00:52:21.961
You love dolphins!

1058
00:52:22.044 --> 00:52:23.671
- Oh, newsflash, mum!
- Hmm?


1059
00:52:23.754 --> 00:52:25.297
Ezra's in love with <i>you.</i>

1060
00:52:25.381 --> 00:52:27.216
- What did you say?

1061
00:52:27.299 --> 00:52:28.926
- What did she say?
- You heard me.


1062
00:52:29.009 --> 00:52:30.552
You all think you know
what's best for me


1063
00:52:30.636 --> 00:52:32.805
when you don't even know
what's best for yourselves.


1064
00:52:32.888 --> 00:52:35.224
Oh, this is ridiculous.

1065
00:52:35.307 --> 00:52:36.642
- Mmm!
- Oh!


1066
00:52:36.725 --> 00:52:38.268
Don't.

1067
00:52:39.311 --> 00:52:41.522
You know what?
You're probably right.


1068
00:52:41.605 --> 00:52:43.315
I am going to be alone forever.

1069
00:52:43.399 --> 00:52:45.234
Never going to find love.
Tea shop's going to close.


1070
00:52:45.317 --> 00:52:47.528
What do you mean that
the shop is going to close?


1071
00:52:47.611 --> 00:52:48.654
I...

1072
00:52:48.737 --> 00:52:50.072
You said the shop
was doing well.


1073
00:52:50.155 --> 00:52:52.116
You lied
about the shop?


1074
00:52:52.199 --> 00:52:53.826
I knew it wasn't
going to work out.


1075
00:52:53.909 --> 00:52:56.245
Now you've wasted
all of Popo's money.


1076
00:52:56.328 --> 00:52:58.622
Well, at least my life
isn't some fake pink fantasy


1077
00:52:58.706 --> 00:52:59.790
like yours.

1078
00:52:59.873 --> 00:53:03.043
You think you're better than me
because you left Townsville.


1079
00:53:03.127 --> 00:53:07.047
I thought Lia's going to
move to Sydney and grow up.


1080
00:53:07.131 --> 00:53:10.050
But no. Still selfish, alone
and absolutely tragic.


1081
00:53:10.134 --> 00:53:11.677
I'll show you tragic!

1082
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.345
- Oh!

1083
00:53:13.429 --> 00:53:16.181
- Oh!

1084
00:53:16.974 --> 00:53:19.810
Shame on you both.

1085
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:21.812
Shame on you too, Mother.

1086
00:53:21.895 --> 00:53:23.564
All you've ever taught us

1087
00:53:23.647 --> 00:53:26.316
is how to be
scared of being happy.


1088
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.486
You know what? Dad should have
left us years ago.


1089
00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:31.822
Then our lives wouldn't
have been so miserable.


1090
00:53:31.905 --> 00:53:35.242
And I could actually learn how
to date like a normal person.


1091
00:53:46.795 --> 00:53:48.756
I didn't mean that, Mum.

1092
00:53:51.008 --> 00:53:52.009
Dad...

1093
00:53:53.427 --> 00:53:55.345
You've gone too far.

1094
00:53:56.221 --> 00:53:58.098
Don't bother
coming to the wedding.


1095
00:53:58.182 --> 00:53:59.224
Alice!

1096
00:53:59.308 --> 00:54:01.477
I don't want you
as my maid of honour.


1097
00:54:17.743 --> 00:54:19.995
Wishing you prosperity!

1098
00:54:27.669 --> 00:54:29.713
Hey, boo.
How was the dress fitting?


1099
00:54:29.797 --> 00:54:31.799
Did you have a good time?

1100
00:54:39.473 --> 00:54:41.517
Um...

1101
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.686
So I guess now would be
a bad time to discuss payroll?


1102
00:54:48.148 --> 00:54:50.234
Hey, do you guys do bubble tea?

1103
00:54:50.317 --> 00:54:53.987
We are an artisanal tea shop
that specialises in


1104
00:54:54.071 --> 00:54:58.242
authentic, handcrafted
Chinese tea experiences.


1105
00:54:58.325 --> 00:55:01.370
Hold up. So I just walked
into this tea shop, right?


1106
00:55:01.453 --> 00:55:04.498
And this old woman's like,
we don't do any bubble tea.


1107
00:55:04.581 --> 00:55:07.459
Can I get a takeaway
iced green tea?


1108
00:55:07.543 --> 00:55:08.961
We don't do takeaway.

1109
00:55:10.003 --> 00:55:12.172
Seriously?
You don't do takeaway?


1110
00:55:12.256 --> 00:55:14.550
How are guys doing business?

1111
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.429
This shop was supposed
to be for the community,


1112
00:55:19.513 --> 00:55:22.266
to teach people
about my culture.


1113
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:24.726
So you do do bubble tea.

1114
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:27.146
Oh...

1115
00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.905
- Ah! No!

1116
00:55:46.957 --> 00:55:48.542
You want tea?

1117
00:55:50.169 --> 00:55:52.129
I'll give you tea!

1118
00:55:52.212 --> 00:55:54.798
There are rules to tea, OK?

1119
00:55:54.882 --> 00:55:57.009
It's a Venetian waltz!

1120
00:55:57.092 --> 00:55:59.595
It's not the chicken dance!

1121
00:56:00.971 --> 00:56:03.682
I am here day-in, day-out,

1122
00:56:03.765 --> 00:56:06.768
giving everything,
<i>everything</i> I have!


1123
00:56:06.852 --> 00:56:08.979
But you people,
all you care about


1124
00:56:09.062 --> 00:56:10.564
is bubble tea,

1125
00:56:10.647 --> 00:56:12.357
sugar packets and milk!

1126
00:56:12.441 --> 00:56:14.776
Milk does not belong in tea!

1127
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:18.155
Do you even know
where tea comes from? Huh?


1128
00:56:18.238 --> 00:56:22.034
It comes from China, bitch!

1129

1138
00:56:49.394 --> 00:56:52.439
<i>if you need help with the shop,
then tell me.</i>


1139
00:56:52.522 --> 00:56:54.566
<i>We are family.</i>

1140
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:57.778
<i>Please come to the
Lunar New Year dinner tonight.</i>


1141
00:57:00.322 --> 00:57:02.574
-  <i>Hey, baobao!</i>

1142
00:57:02.658 --> 00:57:05.035
<i>You need to call your mum
and apologise.</i>


1143
00:57:05.118 --> 00:57:06.912
<i>Just talk to her.</i>

1144
00:57:06.995 --> 00:57:09.748
<i>The wedding's only
a few days away.</i>


1145
00:57:12.876 --> 00:57:14.378
-  <i>Hey, sis.</i>

1146
00:57:14.461 --> 00:57:16.463
<i>Can you call me back?</i>

1147
00:57:16.546 --> 00:57:18.715
<i>We really need to talk.</i>

1148
00:57:42.114 --> 00:57:43.824
Go away!

1149
00:57:43.907 --> 00:57:46.493
I said go away.

1150
00:57:46.576 --> 00:57:48.996
It's been three days, Lia.

1151
00:57:49.079 --> 00:57:50.622
That's the max amount of time

1152
00:57:50.706 --> 00:57:52.708
best friends are allowed
to spend apart.


1153
00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:54.459
I didn't make the rules.

1154
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:58.714
Ooh, my God, something died.

1155
00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:00.173
Oh.

1156
00:58:00.257 --> 00:58:01.717
And they were buried
in your mouth.


1157
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.468
This is disgusting.

1158
00:58:03.552 --> 00:58:05.971
Leave me and whatever's
in my mouth alone.


1159
00:58:06.054 --> 00:58:07.639
This isn't some situation

1160
00:58:07.723 --> 00:58:09.474
where I nurse you back to life

1161
00:58:09.558 --> 00:58:11.435
and charmingly
make everything better.


1162
00:58:11.518 --> 00:58:12.978
What are you doing here, then?

1163
00:58:14.354 --> 00:58:16.231
You still have two dates left,

1164
00:58:16.315 --> 00:58:19.526
which means two chances
to find your soulmate.


1165
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:21.403
And if you're not going to
go on a date,


1166
00:58:21.486 --> 00:58:23.905
I'm going to bring
the date to you.


1167
00:58:23.989 --> 00:58:25.365
Mmm. Mm-mm.

1168
00:58:25.449 --> 00:58:27.701
Visiting hours are over,
my friend.


1169
00:58:27.784 --> 00:58:29.411
I'm not meeting anyone new.

1170
00:58:29.494 --> 00:58:33.081
Oh, no.
I think you've met before.


1171
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.754
Oh, hey.
I'm Mason.


1172
00:58:38.837 --> 00:58:41.006
And I'm so excited to
go on a date with you, girl.


1173
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:43.175
What?

1174
00:58:43.258 --> 00:58:45.344
No! Absolutely not.

1175
00:58:45.427 --> 00:58:48.638
Oh, just get dressed
and meet me on the roof!


1176
00:58:48.722 --> 00:58:50.807
I bought all of
your favourite things.


1177
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:53.894
Oh, sticky rice pudding
with mango!


1178
00:58:53.977 --> 00:58:55.145
Mm-hm.

1179
00:58:55.228 --> 00:58:57.147
Honey lemon tea?

1180
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.648
That's right.

1181
00:58:58.732 --> 00:59:00.567
- Matcha mooncakes.

1182
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.694
- You're a mind-reader.
- Yeah.


1183
00:59:02.778 --> 00:59:04.196
I don't know why
it's so difficult


1184
00:59:04.279 --> 00:59:06.323
for a straight man
to plan the perfect day.


1185
00:59:06.406 --> 00:59:07.824
I mean, all you have to do

1186
00:59:07.908 --> 00:59:10.535
is just listen to what
your partner needs, and...


1187
00:59:10.619 --> 00:59:13.497
Oh, actually, now that
I'm saying that,


1188
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.332
I can understand
the difficulty.


1189
00:59:15.415 --> 00:59:18.043
- I know what you're going to say.
- What?


1190
00:59:18.126 --> 00:59:20.253
You're just going to
tell me to suck it up,


1191
00:59:20.337 --> 00:59:22.798
get back out there
and find the man of my dreams.


1192
00:59:22.881 --> 00:59:26.176
God, no, boo.

1193
00:59:27.469 --> 00:59:29.971
You've got enough people
telling you that.


1194
00:59:30.055 --> 00:59:33.892
I'm just here to be
an open ear,


1195
00:59:33.975 --> 00:59:36.228
and get very drunk.

1196
00:59:39.439 --> 00:59:41.316
I'm exhausted.

1197
00:59:43.151 --> 00:59:45.028
And I'm lonely.

1198
00:59:48.365 --> 00:59:51.410
And I feel like
I'm letting everyone down.


1199
00:59:51.493 --> 00:59:53.912
Oh...

1200
00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:57.582
Here.

1201
00:59:57.666 --> 00:59:59.126
Have that.

1202
01:00:06.925 --> 01:00:09.636
My grandma would be
so disappointed.


1203
01:00:09.719 --> 01:00:10.720
Oh...

1204
01:00:12.013 --> 01:00:13.890
She used to hum this song

1205
01:00:13.974 --> 01:00:17.018
while we would wait
for the tea to bloom.


1206
01:00:20.689 --> 01:00:22.816
Waiting for the water
and the leaves


1207
01:00:22.899 --> 01:00:25.110
to finish their dance.

1208
01:00:49.342 --> 01:00:50.594
You know...

1209
01:00:50.677 --> 01:00:52.846
Life is like a dance.

1210
01:00:53.305 --> 01:00:55.098
Find your balance.

1211
01:00:55.432 --> 01:00:57.142
Follow the rhythm.

1212
01:00:57.851 --> 01:01:00.437
Dance however you want.

1213
01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:08.862
OK, what...

1214
01:01:08.945 --> 01:01:10.489
What was that?

1215
01:01:12.324 --> 01:01:14.993
I just remember
something I'd forgotten.


1216
01:01:18.288 --> 01:01:19.456
Oh!

1217
01:01:19.539 --> 01:01:21.458
Why is this the best date
so far?


1218
01:01:21.541 --> 01:01:24.628
Oh, sweetie.

1219
01:01:26.046 --> 01:01:28.256
If you want to do some
over-the-pants stuff, we...


1220
01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.633
- Mason.
- Oh, good.


1221
01:01:29.716 --> 01:01:31.384
- I was dreading it, too.
- Yeah.


1222
01:02:43.123 --> 01:02:45.083
Oh, my God.

1223
01:02:46.293 --> 01:02:47.627
Life is a dance.

1224
01:02:47.711 --> 01:02:50.255
As long as you're enjoying
the rhythm, you can dance


1225
01:02:50.338 --> 01:02:52.340
whatever way you choose,

1226
01:02:52.424 --> 01:02:54.050
whenever you choose.

1227
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:59.973
- Hmm.
- Well, Lia, it looks amazing.


1228
01:03:08.648 --> 01:03:10.025
I gave it a try.

1229
01:03:10.108 --> 01:03:11.943
Didn't I, Grandma?

1230
01:03:36.968 --> 01:03:38.553
- Hello?
-  <i>Lia!</i>


1231
01:03:38.637 --> 01:03:42.390
<i>Where the hell are you?
Get downstairs now.</i>


1232
01:03:44.476 --> 01:03:46.269
Uh, wow!

1233
01:03:46.353 --> 01:03:48.396
I thought the makeover
would improve business,


1234
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.732
but I didn't think it was
going to happen this fast.


1235
01:03:50.815 --> 01:03:51.858
Mm-hm. OK.

1236
01:03:51.941 --> 01:03:55.236
So there's good news
and there's great news.


1237
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.947
The good news is
you have fans now.


1238
01:03:58.031 --> 01:03:59.157
And the great news?

1239
01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.285
The great news
is you're a meme.


1240
01:04:02.369 --> 01:04:04.496
- 10 million views and counting.

1241
01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:06.998
All you care about
is bubble tea!


1242
01:04:07.082 --> 01:04:09.793
Oh, you are getting
the full treatment.


1243
01:04:09.876 --> 01:04:12.921
They turned you into a song,
a lip-synch challenge...


1244
01:04:13.004 --> 01:04:15.340
T-t-t-tea!
I'll give you bubble tea!


1245
01:04:15.423 --> 01:04:16.966
Bubble tea! Sugar packets!

1246
01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:18.843
B-b-b-bubble tea!

1247
01:04:18.927 --> 01:04:19.969
And milk!

1248
01:04:20.053 --> 01:04:22.472
Oh, and the reenactments! Oh!

1249
01:04:22.555 --> 01:04:23.807
<i>Bubble tea!
Sugar packets!</i>


1250
01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:25.433
<i>B-b-b-bubble tea!</i>

1251
01:04:25.517 --> 01:04:26.810
<i>And milk!</i>

1252
01:04:26.893 --> 01:04:29.688
<i>Milk does not belong in tea!</i>

1253
01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:31.231
- Holy moly!
- Yeah!


1254
01:04:31.314 --> 01:04:33.149
That's insane.

1255
01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:34.943
They started calling
you Crazy Tea Lady,


1256
01:04:35.026 --> 01:04:36.528
but then woke TikTok
called them racist,


1257
01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:37.696
so they backed off.

1258
01:04:37.779 --> 01:04:40.615
We need to stop making merch,
like, yesterday.


1259
01:04:40.699 --> 01:04:41.950
This is a nightmare.

1260
01:04:42.033 --> 01:04:43.410
This is publicity.

1261
01:04:43.493 --> 01:04:44.869
Yeah, but I'm just a joke.

1262
01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:46.705
- Baby, you're a meme.

1263
01:04:46.788 --> 01:04:48.790
Oh, my God, there she is,
the Crazy Tea Lady!


1264
01:04:48.873 --> 01:04:50.709
- Are they angry?

1265
01:04:50.792 --> 01:04:52.377
I think excited.

1266
01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.670
Let us in!

1267
01:04:53.753 --> 01:04:55.714
But also maybe
a little bit angry.


1268
01:04:55.797 --> 01:04:58.842
So, are we opening the shop
or what?


1269
01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:00.844
OK, but hold on.

1270
01:05:00.927 --> 01:05:03.722
If they want a photo,
it's a minimum spend of $25,


1271
01:05:03.805 --> 01:05:05.598
- and store capacity is 30.
-  We want tea!


1272
01:05:05.682 --> 01:05:07.183
Anything else?

1273
01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:11.396
- Smile and take deep breaths.

1274
01:05:11.479 --> 01:05:12.897
OK, people,

1275
01:05:12.981 --> 01:05:16.901
only 50 allowed in the store
at all times.


1276
01:05:16.985 --> 01:05:18.820
$60 minimum purchase

1277
01:05:18.903 --> 01:05:21.197
to take a selfie
with the Crazy Tea Lady.


1278
01:05:21.281 --> 01:05:24.951
I can call her that
because that is <i>my</i> best friend.


1279
01:05:25.034 --> 01:05:26.995
Is this tea good for anger?

1280
01:05:27.078 --> 01:05:30.331
As in, does it make me angrier,
like you.


1281
01:05:30.415 --> 01:05:34.377
Oh, well, the tea
is great for digestion.


1282
01:05:34.461 --> 01:05:36.463
You know, you're not
as terrible as that clip


1283
01:05:36.546 --> 01:05:38.381
that the whole of Australia
has seen.


1284
01:05:39.382 --> 01:05:40.675
Thanks.

1285
01:05:40.759 --> 01:05:42.260
Thank you so much.

1286
01:05:42.343 --> 01:05:44.053
And here's 10%
off your next purchase.


1287
01:05:44.137 --> 01:05:45.305
Thank you.

1288
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:48.850
Everybody loves a discount.

1289
01:05:49.893 --> 01:05:55.231
OK, everyone, get ready
for the first demonstration.


1290
01:05:55.315 --> 01:05:57.734
What demonstration?

1291
01:05:57.817 --> 01:06:00.111
Do your tea ceremony.

1292
01:06:00.195 --> 01:06:01.696
- Now?
- Uh-huh.


1293
01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.824
Come for the crazy,
stay for the tea.


1294
01:06:04.908 --> 01:06:07.869
It's what you've
been working for.


1295
01:06:20.924 --> 01:06:23.051
When you meet someone in China,

1296
01:06:23.134 --> 01:06:24.594
they make you tea.

1297
01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.101
So tea is not just
a drink to me.


1298
01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:35.188
It's a safe place.

1299
01:06:37.398 --> 01:06:39.359
It's a hello.

1300
01:07:16.104 --> 01:07:17.397
Of course you can.

1301
01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.232
This is the only tea where...

1302
01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:22.652
Oolong.

1303
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.615
Lia!

1304
01:07:29.325 --> 01:07:31.619
- I have a wedding to get to.

1305
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:38.918
OK, everyone. Um...

1306
01:07:39.002 --> 01:07:43.548
Valentine's tea sets for two
are 20% off.


1307
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:45.174
For today only.

1308
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:15.455
Alice!

1309
01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:25.882
Alice, I'm...
I'm so sorry about your dress.


1310
01:08:25.965 --> 01:08:27.383
I've been so rotten.

1311
01:08:27.467 --> 01:08:28.885
- You were right.

1312
01:08:28.968 --> 01:08:31.220
I want people
to think I'm perfect


1313
01:08:31.304 --> 01:08:33.139
so they can't hurt me.

1314
01:08:33.222 --> 01:08:36.267
But it makes me so tired.

1315
01:08:36.351 --> 01:08:37.727
And I...

1316
01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:39.812
And I really...

1317
01:08:39.896 --> 01:08:41.189
Be quiet!

1318
01:08:42.565 --> 01:08:43.983
No, no, no, no.
You were right.


1319
01:08:44.067 --> 01:08:45.443
I'm embarrassed

1320
01:08:45.526 --> 01:08:49.614
that you were so much
further ahead in your life,


1321
01:08:49.697 --> 01:08:52.116
like I chose the wrong part
or something.


1322
01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.243
No! You're fearless.

1323
01:08:54.327 --> 01:08:57.205
You left and I stayed home.

1324
01:08:57.288 --> 01:09:00.416
I'm the failure!

1325
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.251
Even though I'm still prettier,

1326
01:09:02.335 --> 01:09:04.212
it's all I have.

1327
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:07.215
Also...

1328
01:09:08.466 --> 01:09:09.759
Thank you, Lia.

1329
01:09:09.842 --> 01:09:10.969
For what?

1330
01:09:11.052 --> 01:09:14.681
The bonbonnieres.
They're perfect.


1331
01:09:14.764 --> 01:09:16.265
Oh, uh...

1332
01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:17.934
I'm so glad you love them.

1333
01:09:18.017 --> 01:09:20.895
They're going to be
the best part of the wedding.


1334
01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:25.942
Don't cry. You're going to
make me cry.


1335
01:09:26.025 --> 01:09:27.151
OK.

1336
01:09:27.235 --> 01:09:28.820
- Let me fix your makeup.
- OK.


1337
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:31.948
Where's Mum?

1338
01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:33.700
She stepped out.

1339
01:09:33.783 --> 01:09:35.576
OK.

1340
01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:43.918
Mum?

1341
01:09:45.003 --> 01:09:46.087
Mum.

1342
01:09:51.384 --> 01:09:52.802
Mum?

1343
01:09:52.885 --> 01:09:54.470
Oh. Sorry.

1344
01:09:54.554 --> 01:09:55.847
Whoa!

1345
01:09:57.015 --> 01:09:58.683
Oh!

1346
01:09:58.766 --> 01:10:00.018
- Oh, my God.

1347
01:10:01.894 --> 01:10:02.979
Oh.

1348
01:10:04.188 --> 01:10:06.482
I... I found my lip liner.
Thank you, Ezra.


1349
01:10:06.566 --> 01:10:08.151
It was in my purse
the whole time.


1350
01:10:08.234 --> 01:10:09.861
I'll go save us a seat, babe.

1351
01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:12.238
I mean, Jing.
I mean, Principal.


1352
01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.616
Uh...

1353
01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:27.170
Jing...

1354
01:10:27.253 --> 01:10:28.880
or babe...

1355
01:10:30.006 --> 01:10:31.549
...are just fine.

1356
01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:41.601
- It's good to see you, Lia.
- Yes, you too, Ez.


1357
01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:53.988
I just came to apologise
for lying about the shop.


1358
01:10:54.072 --> 01:10:55.364
Hey...

1359
01:10:56.783 --> 01:10:57.909
You were right.

1360
01:10:57.992 --> 01:10:59.327
I was?

1361
01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:03.998
I was so unhappy
with your father, I...


1362
01:11:05.249 --> 01:11:07.502
...I focused everything
on you girls.


1363
01:11:08.836 --> 01:11:10.880
And when you left...

1364
01:11:11.923 --> 01:11:12.924
Hm.

1365
01:11:14.342 --> 01:11:15.968
...I was jealous.

1366
01:11:19.222 --> 01:11:20.264
'Cause...

1367
01:11:23.726 --> 01:11:27.688
I knew it was absolutely
the right thing for you to do.


1368
01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:32.193
I had forgotten how to
pursue my own happiness.


1369
01:11:34.654 --> 01:11:36.114
I'm sorry.

1370
01:11:36.197 --> 01:11:37.657
Ma...

1371
01:11:40.368 --> 01:11:41.577
No, I'm sorry.

1372
01:11:44.497 --> 01:11:46.457
Let me just say

1373
01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:49.293
Ezra pursues my happiness.

1374
01:11:49.377 --> 01:11:50.878
Mm. Mum...

1375
01:11:50.962 --> 01:11:52.672
too much information.

1376
01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:54.048
Oh, Lia.

1377
01:11:54.132 --> 01:11:56.050
He is a linguist.

1378
01:11:56.134 --> 01:11:57.844
Oh. Oh! Oh, God.

1379
01:11:57.927 --> 01:11:59.887
OK.
I didn't need to know that.


1380
01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:01.889
No, let me tell you
what happened yesterday.


1381
01:12:01.973 --> 01:12:04.016
- No! Please! Shh! Shh! Shh!
- Hmm!


1382
01:12:20.366 --> 01:12:22.368
Thank you, Mum.

1383
01:13:03.576 --> 01:13:05.369
Oh, my gosh!
You made it!


1384
01:13:05.453 --> 01:13:07.121
Yes!

1385
01:13:07.205 --> 01:13:09.415
We sold out in an hour.

1386
01:13:09.498 --> 01:13:10.958
- What?
- Mm-hm.


1387
01:13:11.042 --> 01:13:12.376
I took the next flight out

1388
01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:14.462
and caught the last 10 minutes
of the ceremony.


1389
01:13:14.545 --> 01:13:17.048
- Oh!
- It was very...


1390
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:18.382
pink.

1391
01:13:18.466 --> 01:13:20.551
- Mmm. Yes.

1392
01:13:20.635 --> 01:13:22.720
Well, that's exactly
what my sister wanted.


1393
01:13:22.803 --> 01:13:24.472
Mmm.

1394
01:13:24.555 --> 01:13:27.934
Oh! Thank you so much for doing
the bonbonnieres!


1395
01:13:28.017 --> 01:13:29.936
What? What are you
talking about?


1396
01:13:30.019 --> 01:13:30.937
Nothing.

1397
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.480
- Oh.
- Yeah.


1398
01:13:32.563 --> 01:13:35.024
Yeah, 'cause, um...

1399
01:13:35.107 --> 01:13:38.861
OK. Who is that
xiao long bae over there?


1400
01:13:38.945 --> 01:13:39.946
- Oh!

1401
01:13:40.029 --> 01:13:42.198
That... is someone

1402
01:13:42.281 --> 01:13:44.700
you would probably be
a perfect match for.


1403
01:13:44.784 --> 01:13:46.827
Uh... No. Are you sure?

1404
01:13:46.911 --> 01:13:48.246
This is your last day.

1405
01:13:48.329 --> 01:13:49.580
To live?

1406
01:13:49.664 --> 01:13:51.290
No, sweetie...

1407
01:13:51.374 --> 01:13:52.667
Five blind dates!

1408
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:55.127
Oh, gosh. I...

1409
01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:58.381
Alice probably invited all
the dates here for one last go.


1410
01:13:58.464 --> 01:13:59.799
Oh.

1411
01:13:59.882 --> 01:14:01.300
It's fine.

1412
01:14:01.384 --> 01:14:02.677
At the stroke of midnight,

1413
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.012
I'll be an unloved crone
forever.


1414
01:14:05.096 --> 01:14:07.473
Well, you know
you'll always be


1415
01:14:07.556 --> 01:14:10.059
<i>my</i> unloved crone
forever, boo.


1416
01:14:10.142 --> 01:14:12.019
Aw. That's sweet.

1417
01:14:13.688 --> 01:14:14.981
Have fun.

1418
01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:19.902
Not him, huh?

1419
01:14:21.737 --> 01:14:22.905
Nope.

1420
01:14:22.989 --> 01:14:25.616
- He was not the one.
- Mmm.


1421
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:26.867
No.

1422
01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:29.287
But they're going to be
very happy together.


1423
01:14:29.829 --> 01:14:32.039
So, who did you choose?

1424
01:14:32.581 --> 01:14:34.041
No-one.

1425
01:14:34.125 --> 01:14:36.127
None of them felt right.

1426
01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:38.337
Besides, I didn't even
go on the five dates


1427
01:14:38.421 --> 01:14:39.755
before the wedding.

1428
01:14:40.339 --> 01:14:44.010
My child, I didn't say
whose wedding.


1429
01:14:45.469 --> 01:14:47.722
I believe you have
one date left.


1430
01:14:50.266 --> 01:14:52.560
Wow! Gorgeous!

1431
01:14:52.727 --> 01:14:55.438
Your sister has amazing taste
in hors d'oeuvres.


1432
01:14:56.522 --> 01:14:57.606
Mm-hm.

1433
01:15:03.571 --> 01:15:05.114
Oh...

1434
01:15:06.157 --> 01:15:07.408
- Hey.
- Hey.


1435
01:15:07.491 --> 01:15:10.911
Hey, you and Richard,
you nailed these.


1436
01:15:13.205 --> 01:15:15.750
You're a good bloke, Nigel.

1437
01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:18.544
Richard knocked them out,
didn't he?


1438
01:15:19.587 --> 01:15:22.089
Yeah. Yeah, he, uh...
he stayed up all night.


1439
01:15:22.173 --> 01:15:24.884
Said you needed a helping hand.

1440
01:15:24.967 --> 01:15:26.218
Same old Richard, huh?

1441
01:15:26.302 --> 01:15:28.596
He's always got
everybody's back.


1442
01:15:28.679 --> 01:15:30.139
Just like with his mum.

1443
01:15:31.182 --> 01:15:34.060
You know, once his mum got sick
after high school,


1444
01:15:34.143 --> 01:15:37.146
he single handedly
kept the family together?


1445
01:15:47.948 --> 01:15:51.410
Nigel, I am so excited
to have a brother.


1446
01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:53.454
- Come here.
- Oh.


1447
01:15:54.789 --> 01:15:56.791
Welcome to the family.

1448
01:15:58.876 --> 01:16:00.628
- Son-in-law.
- Hello.


1449
01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:03.005
Give me a moment
with my daughter.


1450
01:16:08.344 --> 01:16:10.012
Nice party.

1451
01:16:10.096 --> 01:16:11.931
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.


1452
01:16:12.014 --> 01:16:15.434
You know, Lia, you probably
think I'm a bad dad.


1453
01:16:15.518 --> 01:16:17.937
You know, I don't stick to

1454
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.731
traditional parenting rules, much.

1455
01:16:20.815 --> 01:16:22.149
No, well, you know,

1456
01:16:22.233 --> 01:16:24.193
some rules
are made to be broken.


1457
01:16:24.276 --> 01:16:26.195
Aha.

1458
01:16:26.278 --> 01:16:28.948
You're absolutely my daughter.

1459
01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:37.415
Popo would be so proud
of the woman you've become.


1460
01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:41.127
As am I.

1461
01:16:43.587 --> 01:16:45.714
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hm.


1462
01:16:48.467 --> 01:16:51.137
Hey, Dad, you want to dance?

1463
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.514
I would love to!

1464
01:16:53.597 --> 01:16:55.182
Let's go.

1465
01:16:56.809 --> 01:16:59.353
- Coming through.
- Coming through.


1466
01:16:59.437 --> 01:17:01.105

Good girl.

Mama. Baba.

1477
01:17:27.798 --> 01:17:30.009
Hmm?

1478
01:17:30.092 --> 01:17:31.927
Mmm.

1479
01:17:34.722 --> 01:17:36.849
- Don't spend it all at once.

1480
01:17:36.932 --> 01:17:38.017
Really?

1481
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.977
How much did you put
in that envelope?


1482
01:17:40.102 --> 01:17:41.562
I can't say.

1483
01:17:43.939 --> 01:17:45.191
I wish you guys

1484
01:17:45.774 --> 01:17:47.193
one hundred years of happiness.

1485
01:17:47.276 --> 01:17:48.986
Welcome to the family home.

1486
01:17:49.069 --> 01:17:50.404
Xiexie, Baba.

1487
01:17:51.989 --> 01:17:54.200
- Alice.
- Xiexie, Mama.


1488
01:17:57.828 --> 01:18:00.831
Lia, it's your turn.

1489
01:18:11.425 --> 01:18:13.177
Thank you.

1490
01:18:15.638 --> 01:18:18.641
Sorry, I wasn't expecting to
have money to give.


1491
01:18:18.724 --> 01:18:20.893
Thank you.

1492
01:18:20.976 --> 01:18:22.603
But this was Popo's.

1493
01:18:25.064 --> 01:18:26.690
Popo said

1494
01:18:26.774 --> 01:18:28.692
there are five different
types of tea


1495
01:18:28.776 --> 01:18:31.237
and even though they all
come from the same leaf,


1496
01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.073
they couldn't be more different
from each other.


1497
01:18:34.156 --> 01:18:35.866
Just like in life,

1498
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:37.493
or in love...

1499
01:18:38.494 --> 01:18:39.954
...how you treat the leaf

1500
01:18:40.037 --> 01:18:42.414
is what yields
the different results.


1501
01:18:42.498 --> 01:18:45.501
We are all like
different kinds of tea.


1502
01:18:45.584 --> 01:18:47.461
We can be like family...

1503
01:18:51.298 --> 01:18:52.508
...or friends,

1504
01:18:52.591 --> 01:18:55.052
the people who hold
parts of your heart.


1505
01:18:56.095 --> 01:18:57.388
Or even a soul mate...

1506
01:18:58.514 --> 01:19:02.601
...who are sometimes
right in front of you


1507
01:19:02.685 --> 01:19:04.019
the whole time.

1508
01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:13.320
Nigel and Alice,

1509
01:19:13.404 --> 01:19:16.365
you're like
the perfect cup of tea.


1510
01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:20.661
And together, you bloom.

1511
01:19:26.667 --> 01:19:28.961
I know some of that speech
wasn't to me.


1512
01:19:29.044 --> 01:19:32.506
So whoever it is for,
don't let them go.


1513
01:19:34.091 --> 01:19:35.593
OK.

1514
01:19:54.194 --> 01:19:55.321
Richard!

1515
01:20:05.831 --> 01:20:07.082
Richard...

1516
01:20:08.375 --> 01:20:10.502
Why didn't you tell me
about your mum?


1517
01:20:19.011 --> 01:20:20.596
If I did...

1518
01:20:22.431 --> 01:20:24.141
...you would have stayed.

1519
01:20:39.406 --> 01:20:41.659
Wait!

1520
01:20:41.742 --> 01:20:43.911
Can I take you on a date first?

1521
01:20:44.953 --> 01:20:46.288
Y... Yeah.
Yeah, of course.


1522
01:20:46.372 --> 01:20:47.915
OK.

1523
01:20:47.998 --> 01:20:49.166
Oh, what the hell.

1524
01:21:27.204 --> 01:21:29.123
Bubble tea.

1525
01:21:29.206 --> 01:21:30.457
And takeaway green tea.

1526
01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:32.751
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a great day.


1527
01:21:34.586 --> 01:21:36.505
- Hey.
- Thank you. Bye!


1528
