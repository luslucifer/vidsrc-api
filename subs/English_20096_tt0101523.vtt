00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:56.477
<i>Over the water and across the sea...</i>

2
00:00:56.578 --> 00:00:59.138
<i>on a little island</i>
<i>off the Carolinas...</i>


3
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.047
<i>there once lived a young girl</i>
<i>with a great gift...</i>


4
00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:06.087
<i>who thought she knew it all.</i>

5
00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:07.621
<i>That's me.</i>

6
00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:12.591
<i>Folks call me Marina,</i>
<i>and I'm a clairvoyant.</i>


7
00:01:16.198 --> 00:01:19.634
<i>I've always known what people desire</i>
<i>long before they do...</i>


8
00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:23.398
<i>and that's just a gift</i>
<i>I was born with.</i>


9
00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:27.464
<i>Of course, I was always</i>
<i>on the watch for my other half...</i>


10
00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:30.602
<i>what Grammy d'Arbo</i>
<i>calls your split-apart.</i>


11
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.540
<i>Mind you, I had my suitors...</i>

12
00:01:34.683 --> 00:01:37.982
<i>but I was waiting for the signs</i>
<i>to let me know the right one...</i>


13
00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:40.214
<i>a zigzag rainbow...</i>

14
00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.984
<i>a bolt of lightning</i>
<i>ripping through the sky...</i>


15
00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:46.027
<i>the usual things</i>
<i>that tell you love's at hand.</i>


16
00:01:56.738 --> 00:02:00.799
<i>As the years went by,</i>
<i>I grew fevered with anticipation.</i>


17
00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.377
<i>Grammy told me it was hormones.</i>

18
00:02:04.613 --> 00:02:07.241
<i>But I knew love</i>
<i>had to be on its way...</i>


19
00:02:07.382 --> 00:02:10.374
<i>and I could hardly wait</i>
<i>for my journey to begin.</i>


20
00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:23.590
<i>First, a twin-tailed comet</i>
<i>crossed my path...</i>


21
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.998
<i>and I was sure</i>
<i>love could not be far behind.</i>


22
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.573
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>a magical gift washed up on shore...</i>


23
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.649
<i>promising travel</i>
<i>to a faraway place.</i>


24
00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:56.789
<i>And then thejumping mullet fish</i>
<i>yielded up a wedding band...</i>


25
00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.800
<i>an undeniable sign that</i>
<i>I'd soon meet my mate.</i>


26
00:03:13.982 --> 00:03:17.383
<i>And then one night,</i>
<i>I saw him in my dream.</i>


27
00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:20.512
<i>Well, just part of him, actually...</i>

28
00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:23.523
<i>but what a part.</i>

29
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.287
<i>It was a lustrous, glowing smile.</i>

30
00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:29.660
<i>Grammy d'Arbo said you</i>
<i>can tell nothing from a smile...</i>


31
00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:32.199
<i>unless, of course, you're a dentist.</i>

32
00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:38.839
<i>Truth be told, I'd had</i>
<i>just about enough of her wisdom.</i>


33
00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:41.805
<i>I knew what I had seen</i>
<i>in my dream...</i>


34
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.538
<i>the smile of my split-apart.</i>

35
00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:49.645
<i>And he'd be coming over the water</i>
<i>and across the sea...</i>


36
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:51.981
<i>the man of my dreams.</i>

37
00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:54.180
<i>My Adonis.</i>

38
00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:55.517
<i>My Poseidon.</i>

39
00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:59.116
<i>No. No, my Zeus.</i>

40
00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:09.326
<i>Which is why I must admit</i>
<i>I was a mite surprised...</i>


41
00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:12.703
<i>when the tides washed in</i>
<i>my husband-to-be Leo Lemke.</i>


42
00:04:16.078 --> 00:04:20.208
<i>Grammy d'Arbo always said love</i>
<i>is the leap that won't be denied.</i>


43
00:04:24.152 --> 00:04:26.382
<i>And what a leap I made...</i>

44
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:29.513
<i>from my little island to his.</i>

45
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:17.434
Kids, don't waste the water!

46
00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:22.807
You little bastards!

47
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:25.038
I'll make sausage out of ya!

48
00:05:39.194 --> 00:05:41.958
Ladies, could you help me, please?

49
00:06:16.698 --> 00:06:20.429
Molly, Gina,
this is my bride, Marina Lemke.


50
00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:22.594
Bride?

51
00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:31.543
Welcome to the neighborhood.

52
00:06:35.417 --> 00:06:37.408
Leo. You'll get a hernia.

53
00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:43.618
Love's made a young man of me.

54
00:06:50.665 --> 00:06:52.792
No peeking, now.
No peeking.


55
00:07:07.082 --> 00:07:08.982
It's for wrapping the meat.

56
00:07:11.052 --> 00:07:13.919
That's right! You always got to
wear an apron. Always.


57
00:07:16.658 --> 00:07:19.593
And you'll be working here,
behind the counter.


58
00:07:23.398 --> 00:07:25.889
- It's fragile.
- Sorry.


59
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:27.901
The most important
part of the business...


60
00:07:28.003 --> 00:07:29.664
keeping the customer satisfied.

61
00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:58.593
Oh, Leo, you're back.

62
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.294
Hey, Harper, you're holding me up?

63
00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:03.303
Oh. This?

64
00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:06.499
The writers decided that Harper's
gonna kill somebody next week.


65
00:08:06.608 --> 00:08:08.803
Of course,
they haven't decided whom.


66
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.810
But I decided I'd start
working with the weapon...


67
00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:14.075
so I'd be more in-the-moment
when it comes.


68
00:08:14.182 --> 00:08:17.174
Honey, this is Robyn Graves.

69
00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:20.413
She's Harper on <i>Our Daily Bread.</i>

70
00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:22.682
- Big TV star.
- Well, hardly.


71
00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:25.759
And this is Marina Lemke...

72
00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:28.619
my wife.

73
00:08:28.763 --> 00:08:30.094
Pleased to meet ya.

74
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.167
Your wife?

75
00:08:34.503 --> 00:08:38.064
I mean, my God.
Congratulations.


76
00:08:38.173 --> 00:08:40.698
That's wonderful.

77
00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:41.901
Leo, you sneaky devil.

78
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.774
You didn't even tell me
you were seeing anybody.


79
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.904
So...

80
00:08:46.014 --> 00:08:48.642
I was just showing Marina
around the shop.


81
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.241
- We're not really open.
- Oh, no, Leo.


82
00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:53.253
You got to help me, please. Please?

83
00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:56.282
I got some stuff
in the freezer if you want.


84
00:08:56.424 --> 00:09:00.224
- Just something for the barbecue.
- Let me see what I can do ya.


85
00:09:04.499 --> 00:09:06.899
So Leo married.

86
00:09:07.002 --> 00:09:09.368
And you too. That's great.

87
00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:13.600
- When did you two meet?
- Two days ago.


88
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.809
You're kidding.
Oh, that's so brave.


89
00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:21.508
I mean, it's just
that it seems so sudden.


90
00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:24.915
- How did you know he was the one?
- I dreamed about him.


91
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.788
Oh, God.

92
00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:30.357
I wish I got some answers
when I'm asleep.


93
00:09:30.492 --> 00:09:34.155
All I ever dream about
is being on stage naked...


94
00:09:34.262 --> 00:09:38.289
which is so textbook I'm embarrassed
to tell my boyfriend about it.


95
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.425
- He's a shrink.
- Shrink?


96
00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:43.197
Psychiatrist.
And I know that he wishes...


97
00:09:43.305 --> 00:09:47.036
I had more complicated dreams, so...

98
00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:49.736
I make 'em up sometimes.

99
00:09:49.844 --> 00:09:51.004
Maybe I could borrow yours.

100
00:09:52.113 --> 00:09:54.741
"Honey, I dreamed
I was at my wedding last night...


101
00:09:54.849 --> 00:09:56.840
and you were the one.

102
00:09:56.952 --> 00:09:58.351
The one and only."

103
00:09:59.588 --> 00:10:01.749
How will I ever know for sure?

104
00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:04.350
Oh, you'll know.

105
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.532
There's love waiting for you
behind a friendly face.


106
00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:20.906
There'll be big changes...

107
00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:24.604
and a nice surprise...

108
00:10:24.713 --> 00:10:26.340
but don't be scared of it.

109
00:10:26.448 --> 00:10:28.416
Just stand up to it.

110
00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:31.451
Destiny has a way
of working itself out.


111
00:10:31.553 --> 00:10:33.953
That's what Grandma
d'Arbo always says.


112
00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:37.991
Then Alex is it.
I think you're right.


113
00:10:38.093 --> 00:10:41.085
I think we've both been
just fooling ourselves...


114
00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:43.254
with all this talk
about shared independence...


115
00:10:43.365 --> 00:10:44.559
when basically at heart...

116
00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:47.134
I am an old-fashioned girl.

117
00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:49.135
- I could just die...
- Here you go, sweetheart.


118
00:10:49.237 --> 00:10:52.900
A couple of London broils. You can
defrost them in the microwave.


119
00:10:53.008 --> 00:10:54.908
Thanks, Leo.
You know, your wife...


120
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.070
Is something special, all right.

121
00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:00.545
Robyn, we've been driving all day...

122
00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:04.881
and this is our first night
home together.


123
00:11:04.986 --> 00:11:07.147
We got to close up now.

124
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.250
Oh, God.
How insensitive of me.


125
00:11:11.393 --> 00:11:13.156
Okay.

126
00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:16.990
- Leo, what do I owe you?
- You can pay me next time.


127
00:11:17.098 --> 00:11:19.589
- I don't got any change.
- Oh, hey.


128
00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:22.760
Thank you. We'll talk?

129
00:11:22.871 --> 00:11:24.964
Looking towards it.

130
00:11:25.073 --> 00:11:26.973
- See you later.
- Bye.


131
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.737
Honey...

132
00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:34.781
how come you told her
all that stuff?


133
00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:39.285
Just thought she
might want to know.


134
00:12:05.814 --> 00:12:09.443
Welcome back!
I hear congratulations are in order.


135
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:12.418
Hey, Doc!
Meet my new bride, Marina.


136
00:12:24.632 --> 00:12:26.566
- You all right?
- I'm fine.


137
00:12:26.668 --> 00:12:28.829
I was just careless.

138
00:12:28.937 --> 00:12:30.598
Yeah.

139
00:12:38.747 --> 00:12:41.307
- I hope you have enough space.
- Oh, plenty.


140
00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:45.512
You know, I wasn't expecting
to bring home a new wife.


141
00:12:48.623 --> 00:12:50.454
That thing's awful loud.

142
00:12:50.558 --> 00:12:53.118
I got a brand-new
digital alarm clock from the bank.


143
00:12:53.228 --> 00:12:54.525
Want me to put this
in the living room?


144
00:12:54.662 --> 00:12:58.325
Oh, no. This clock's been
with my family since heaven started.


145
00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:02.425
- It's a perpetual motion clock.
- There's no such thing.


146
00:13:02.537 --> 00:13:04.505
Well, sure.

147
00:13:04.606 --> 00:13:08.303
Grandma d'Arbo says those ticks
are the heartbeat of a marriage...


148
00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:11.401
two hearts beating as one.

149
00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:15.173
That's nice, honey.

150
00:13:16.584 --> 00:13:17.744
Don't you go anywhere.

151
00:13:38.106 --> 00:13:41.098
You can't beat Bessie.

152
00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:42.471
Who's that?

153
00:13:42.577 --> 00:13:45.842
Oh, Bessie Smith...

154
00:13:45.947 --> 00:13:47.881
the empress of the blues.

155
00:13:48.983 --> 00:13:53.317
- How come it sounds so scratchy?
- It's an original pressing.


156
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:54.820
Very rare.

157
00:14:06.434 --> 00:14:08.868
No one's ever wanted me
to dance with them before.


158
00:14:09.003 --> 00:14:11.904
- I can't believe that.
- Well, it's the truth.


159
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:23.383
This town is just
crackling with current.


160
00:14:23.484 --> 00:14:26.578
I'm never going to get to sleep.

161
00:14:26.688 --> 00:14:28.451
I was thinking...

162
00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:31.753
maybe you could take me out
to meet some of the neighbors.


163
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.987
We got to get up early tomorrow.

164
00:14:34.128 --> 00:14:36.722
We got a big delivery coming.

165
00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:38.890
I think it's going
to be late arriving.


166
00:14:39.033 --> 00:14:42.025
Something... Cracked axle.

167
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.502
- I'm getting good at this.
- You sure are.


168
00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:48.508
So what do you say?

169
00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:54.780
I say I'm one lucky butcher.

170
00:14:54.883 --> 00:14:58.011
I'm sure glad I found you.

171
00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:00.053
I found you.

172
00:15:17.038 --> 00:15:19.768
I'm sorry. It's just,
you took me by surprise.


173
00:15:19.874 --> 00:15:23.776
I thought our next decision
is living together, not marriage.


174
00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:27.937
Where did this come from
all of a sudden?


175
00:15:28.049 --> 00:15:30.483
The butcher's wife.

176
00:15:30.585 --> 00:15:31.882
What?

177
00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:34.454
Leo's wife.

178
00:15:34.555 --> 00:15:36.955
I've been to a lot
of clairvoyants in my time...


179
00:15:37.058 --> 00:15:39.151
and this one is the real thing.

180
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.252
She's a very wise woman.
I could tell.


181
00:15:42.397 --> 00:15:44.331
Leo's married to a clairvoyant?

182
00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:46.296
And she told me...

183
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:49.768
"Love is waiting for you
behind a friendly face.


184
00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:51.998
Don't be scared of it.

185
00:15:52.106 --> 00:15:54.040
You can stand up to it."

186
00:15:55.877 --> 00:15:58.402
Where the hell did Leo meet a gypsy?

187
00:15:58.513 --> 00:16:01.710
Alex, do you want to
get married or not?


188
00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:03.716
- Before we answer that question...
- Oh, God.


189
00:16:03.818 --> 00:16:06.184
Sit down.

190
00:16:06.287 --> 00:16:08.551
If she's going to have
such a profound effect on us...


191
00:16:08.656 --> 00:16:10.487
I'd like to know more about her.

192
00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:13.287
- Could we get off her and on to us?
- I'm concerned.


193
00:16:13.428 --> 00:16:15.953
No, curious. Yes.

194
00:16:16.097 --> 00:16:19.032
If you're going to talk
about getting married...


195
00:16:19.133 --> 00:16:22.967
why would you approach some
strange woman in a butcher shop?


196
00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:24.834
Why wouldn't you just come to me?

197
00:16:25.974 --> 00:16:28.306
Forget it! Just forget it!

198
00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:31.606
I should've told you I dreamed it.
We'd be at the altar by now.


199
00:16:31.713 --> 00:16:34.443
- Can we talk about this rationally?
- No.


200
00:16:34.549 --> 00:16:36.949
Can you fight like a man
instead of a shrink?


201
00:16:37.051 --> 00:16:41.385
All I am trying to say is that
marriage is an inspired decision.


202
00:16:50.798 --> 00:16:53.699
And I told you I'm uncomfortable
with the term "shrink."


203
00:16:53.801 --> 00:16:55.393
Shrink!

204
00:18:49.317 --> 00:18:51.342
"We are all in the gutter...

205
00:18:51.452 --> 00:18:55.286
but some of us are
looking at the stars."


206
00:18:56.691 --> 00:18:58.318
Who'd have done that?

207
00:18:58.426 --> 00:19:01.623
- It's beautiful.
- It's vandalism.


208
00:19:01.762 --> 00:19:04.629
I could wash it off
for a couple of bucks.


209
00:19:04.732 --> 00:19:06.962
Don't you want to
let it stay put?


210
00:19:07.068 --> 00:19:08.535
What?

211
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:11.263
Well, what would it hurt?

212
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.074
We got some chores around the shop,
if you're handy with a broom.


213
00:19:20.414 --> 00:19:22.109
- We do?
- Sure.


214
00:19:22.216 --> 00:19:24.684
We've got that big delivery
arriving late this afternoon.


215
00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:27.754
This morning.
Can I talk to you for a minute?


216
00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:30.255
Excuse me.

217
00:19:30.358 --> 00:19:32.349
I know this kid. He's trouble.

218
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.724
No, I don't see that.

219
00:19:34.862 --> 00:19:38.525
Maybe a little misunderstood.
He could use a job.


220
00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:40.566
What do you say?

221
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.175
Hey, what are you waiting for?

222
00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:53.304
Get in here
before he changes his mind.


223
00:20:01.455 --> 00:20:05.789
Eugene, come on out here!
Just come on out here!


224
00:20:05.893 --> 00:20:09.664
I want you to go out
and sweep out the back room.


225
00:20:09.664 --> 00:20:11.962
- Right now?
- No. Tomorrow.


226
00:20:17.338 --> 00:20:20.830
And a dollar and a quarter.
You stop back soon.


227
00:20:20.942 --> 00:20:23.103
Thanks. I will.

228
00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:25.338
Love your window.
It's so original.


229
00:20:25.446 --> 00:20:27.505
Thank you. See ya later.

230
00:20:31.485 --> 00:20:33.510
Afternoon, Dr. Tremor.

231
00:20:33.621 --> 00:20:35.248
What would you be needing?

232
00:20:35.356 --> 00:20:38.792
I'm just looking for someone.

233
00:20:38.926 --> 00:20:41.417
He's in the back.

234
00:20:41.562 --> 00:20:43.894
I wouldn't fret yourself none
over Eugene.


235
00:20:43.998 --> 00:20:46.660
- He's a good boy.
- Of course he's a good boy.


236
00:20:48.336 --> 00:20:51.066
Doctor, Leo said the chops
are real nice today.


237
00:20:51.172 --> 00:20:53.265
Good. I'd like to talk to you
for a moment.


238
00:20:57.678 --> 00:20:59.509
Sorry, Doc.
I'm on the clock.


239
00:20:59.614 --> 00:21:02.378
Then I'll just take
a moment of your time.


240
00:21:03.384 --> 00:21:05.045
It's okay. Go on.

241
00:21:08.923 --> 00:21:10.891
Eugene, what are you doing?

242
00:21:11.025 --> 00:21:13.585
- I'm sweeping out the bad luck.
- What?


243
00:21:13.728 --> 00:21:15.992
It's a sedge broom
from Ocracoke.


244
00:21:16.097 --> 00:21:18.998
That's an island off the coast
of North Carolina, where I'm from.


245
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.399
Will you excuse us for a moment?
Eugene...


246
00:21:22.503 --> 00:21:25.028
- Did you forget our appointment?
- I got a job now.


247
00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:27.039
I don't need a shrink anymore.

248
00:21:27.141 --> 00:21:30.133
I don't think he likes
being called that.


249
00:21:30.244 --> 00:21:33.008
I'm sorry.

250
00:21:33.114 --> 00:21:36.277
- Hey, Doc. How's it going?
- I'm fine. Thanks, Leo.


251
00:21:36.384 --> 00:21:38.784
Just trying to have a chat
with Eugene, if that's all right.


252
00:21:38.886 --> 00:21:41.286
Sure, sure.
Take your time.


253
00:21:44.392 --> 00:21:47.520
Honey, what are you doing
cutting up all those chops?


254
00:21:47.662 --> 00:21:50.495
We'll have no place to put them
when the delivery truck shows up.


255
00:21:50.598 --> 00:21:53.726
I don't see that as a problem.
They won't be arriving today.


256
00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:56.200
- They called?
- No, not yet.


257
00:21:56.304 --> 00:21:59.831
- I'm really getting good at this.
- I thought we had an agreement.


258
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.703
You were going to see me
until the end of the summer...


259
00:22:01.809 --> 00:22:04.801
before we decided whether
you need a shrink... psychiatrist.


260
00:22:04.912 --> 00:22:08.507
That was an agreement that you
and my probation officer made.


261
00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:10.743
I'm just a troubled kid, Doc.

262
00:22:10.851 --> 00:22:13.411
Who's been telling you that?
You're no trouble at all.


263
00:22:15.956 --> 00:22:19.448
Eugene, I am thrilled
you found a job.


264
00:22:19.593 --> 00:22:24.690
It's a positive move, but I
don't think it precludes therapy.


265
00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.733
We've still got some things
to talk about.


266
00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:29.358
Honey, those chops
are gonna dry out.


267
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.495
Nobody's gonna want
to buy them tomorrow.


268
00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:38.176
It's all in the rhythm, isn't it?

269
00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:41.715
Out of my way, asshole.
Oh, thank God you're open.


270
00:22:41.816 --> 00:22:44.910
He's standing there with
that little-boy-lost look.


271
00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:47.249
"I'm an artist, so it's cool
if my right brain's oatmeal.


272
00:22:47.355 --> 00:22:49.550
Did Jackson Pollack remember
to bring home veal chops?"


273
00:22:49.657 --> 00:22:51.716
I said,
"Cut it out, Julian.


274
00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:54.327
That stopped being cute the day
you got out of art school.


275
00:22:54.462 --> 00:22:57.556
I pay for the food!
You can pick it up!"


276
00:22:58.866 --> 00:23:01.801
So now I've got a sit-down dinner
for 24 influential critics...


277
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:04.200
and art dealers
in less than three hours.


278
00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:08.241
I'm hoping one will discover the
bugger and take him off my hands.


279
00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.106
Of course you're thinking,
"It's her fault.


280
00:23:12.213 --> 00:23:14.113
What kind of sane woman
gets involved with a man...


281
00:23:14.215 --> 00:23:15.512
with pretensions to paint?"

282
00:23:15.616 --> 00:23:18.676
But I'm throwing myself
on your mercy.


283
00:23:19.854 --> 00:23:23.017
I need veal chops.
Lots of them. Now.


284
00:23:24.225 --> 00:23:27.626
- What's this?
- Veal chops. Lots of them. Now.


285
00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:36.803
How'd you do that?

286
00:23:37.872 --> 00:23:40.864
- Oh, great window.
- Bye.


287
00:23:42.376 --> 00:23:45.470
Yeah. How did she do that?

288
00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:51.177
Eugene, why don't you
stop by tonight at 6:00?


289
00:23:51.285 --> 00:23:53.150
We'll talk about this choice.

290
00:23:55.923 --> 00:23:59.518
Don't worry, Doctor.
I'll take good care of him.


291
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.924
I appreciate that, Mrs. Lemke.

292
00:24:05.433 --> 00:24:07.958
Say hey to your gal for me.

293
00:24:08.068 --> 00:24:10.434
Oh, that's right.
You and Robyn had a brief...


294
00:24:10.538 --> 00:24:13.507
or, shall we say,
influential, encounter.


295
00:24:13.607 --> 00:24:16.872
I'm curious, Mrs. Lemke.

296
00:24:16.977 --> 00:24:18.569
Why would you suggest
we get married?


297
00:24:20.548 --> 00:24:24.006
What I say and what people hear
aren't always the same thing.


298
00:24:24.118 --> 00:24:26.916
Don't you find that
in your calling, Doctor?


299
00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:39.130
I never told your sweetheart
to marry with you.


300
00:24:41.569 --> 00:24:43.059
I can see you sparking to her.

301
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.765
A man like you needs someone
bigger than life itself.


302
00:24:46.874 --> 00:24:49.342
But she's not gonna be the one
you'll settle with.


303
00:24:49.443 --> 00:24:51.968
Could you give me a hand?

304
00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:53.876
Yes. Sure.

305
00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:55.539
Thanks.

306
00:25:00.187 --> 00:25:03.088
Can I offer you
a little professional advice?


307
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.283
A scholar like you?
I'd be honored.


308
00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:07.326
Good.

309
00:25:08.662 --> 00:25:12.996
I believe in female intuition,
Mrs. Lemke, to an extent...


310
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.728
It's just a specific manifestation
of the collective unconscious...


311
00:25:15.836 --> 00:25:19.465
but you might want to be careful
about ordering your life...


312
00:25:19.573 --> 00:25:23.407
or anyone else's
for that matter...


313
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:26.446
on such a primitive instinct.

314
00:25:28.415 --> 00:25:30.508
I'll keep that in mind.

315
00:25:30.618 --> 00:25:32.643
Good. Good.

316
00:25:35.189 --> 00:25:37.089
Would you get the door?

317
00:25:47.134 --> 00:25:49.102
Eugene, I'll see you later.

318
00:25:51.205 --> 00:25:53.673
That boy's tongue's
long enough to cut his throat.


319
00:25:53.774 --> 00:25:55.765
I was going to say that.

320
00:25:56.877 --> 00:25:58.504
Honey, it's for...

321
00:26:01.148 --> 00:26:03.173
You want to get that?

322
00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:10.122
Lemke's.

323
00:26:13.928 --> 00:26:15.452
What do you mean
you can't get here?


324
00:26:15.596 --> 00:26:17.530
I need the goddamn beef today!

325
00:26:17.665 --> 00:26:19.963
I better take
my mess out of here.


326
00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:23.525
- What? A cracked axle?
- Eugene, mind the store.


327
00:26:23.637 --> 00:26:24.626
You bet.

328
00:26:24.738 --> 00:26:27.730
Wash your hands before
you touch that meat.


329
00:26:47.127 --> 00:26:49.721
Hi, girls.
How are you today?


330
00:26:49.863 --> 00:26:52.696
Good, real good.
Just out for a stroll.


331
00:27:12.886 --> 00:27:15.548
I don't think
I've seen you here before.


332
00:27:15.656 --> 00:27:19.353
I just moved up here
with my husband.


333
00:27:19.493 --> 00:27:21.017
Maybe you know him.

334
00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:22.924
His name's Leo Lemke.

335
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.292
The butcher?

336
00:27:28.836 --> 00:27:30.565
Hi. Let me know
if you need help.


337
00:27:31.338 --> 00:27:32.965
Well, actually, I do.

338
00:27:33.073 --> 00:27:36.474
I'm looking for
something dowdy and plain.


339
00:27:36.577 --> 00:27:38.010
What's the occasion?

340
00:27:38.112 --> 00:27:39.739
A church recital.

341
00:28:01.268 --> 00:28:03.395
"Lead us not into temptation."

342
00:28:10.244 --> 00:28:18.552
It's so glamorous.

343
00:28:18.552 --> 00:28:23.649
You know, with your hair done up
and some nice shoes...


344
00:28:23.757 --> 00:28:27.056
Been a while since
you were in church.


345
00:28:28.495 --> 00:28:32.898
I see you wearing this
at a nightclub...


346
00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:37.769
and you're standing
in front of a room full of people...


347
00:28:37.871 --> 00:28:39.236
and you're...

348
00:28:42.276 --> 00:28:43.903
and you're singing.

349
00:28:50.784 --> 00:28:52.877
You could always frump these up
with pearls and pumps.


350
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:55.918
I'll take this one.

351
00:29:00.794 --> 00:29:02.261
How much are these?

352
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.427
Those are 350.

353
00:29:07.768 --> 00:29:11.067
I think I got that.
This is three.


354
00:29:11.171 --> 00:29:12.729
I got the change.

355
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.831
There you go.

356
00:29:14.975 --> 00:29:16.840
I got to get back to work.

357
00:29:16.944 --> 00:29:18.707
Thank ya.

358
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.172
See ya later.

359
00:29:27.354 --> 00:29:29.686
I think I've made a breakthrough.

360
00:29:31.492 --> 00:29:33.357
I'm gonna sing the blues.

361
00:29:34.828 --> 00:29:36.125
Sing the blues.

362
00:29:38.031 --> 00:29:40.056
What exactly does that mean to you?

363
00:29:40.167 --> 00:29:41.361
A lounge act.

364
00:29:43.403 --> 00:29:46.167
Actually, I met
this wonderful woman...


365
00:29:46.273 --> 00:29:48.002
in a clothing store...

366
00:29:48.142 --> 00:29:52.340
and I don't remember
exactly what she said...


367
00:29:52.446 --> 00:29:53.777
but it feels right.

368
00:29:53.881 --> 00:29:55.439
I'm gonna sing.

369
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:59.645
All right.
You feel you'd like to sing.


370
00:29:59.753 --> 00:30:03.519
But why do you think
a clerk in a clothing store...


371
00:30:03.624 --> 00:30:05.524
is having such a profound
effect on you?


372
00:30:05.626 --> 00:30:08.356
No, no.
She's not a clerk.


373
00:30:08.462 --> 00:30:10.794
I think she works
in the butcher's shop...


374
00:30:10.898 --> 00:30:12.627
or something, but...

375
00:30:12.733 --> 00:30:14.633
she is so wise.

376
00:30:14.735 --> 00:30:17.397
Stella...

377
00:30:17.504 --> 00:30:19.768
a woman as intelligent
and insightful as yourself...


378
00:30:19.907 --> 00:30:23.308
doesn't need some clairvoyant
to tell you how to live your life.


379
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.139
That's why we're here.

380
00:30:26.847 --> 00:30:29.179
Do you really think
she's clairvoyant?


381
00:30:53.941 --> 00:30:56.068
- Hi.
- Good evening.


382
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.940
Who did that to your window?

383
00:30:59.046 --> 00:31:02.277
Maybe I should do something
like that at the store.


384
00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:04.350
About those shoes...

385
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:06.681
Oh, they are so cozy.

386
00:31:06.787 --> 00:31:08.152
You're working in them?

387
00:31:10.457 --> 00:31:11.754
What's that for?

388
00:31:11.859 --> 00:31:13.656
Supper...

389
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.022
for you and a friend.

390
00:31:16.864 --> 00:31:18.855
Friends I got plenty of.

391
00:31:18.966 --> 00:31:21.264
It's love that's left me wanting.

392
00:31:22.636 --> 00:31:26.163
Well, don't despair.
It takes as long as it takes.


393
00:31:26.273 --> 00:31:27.672
What?

394
00:31:33.513 --> 00:31:36.812
It bothers Leo when I get
to talking this way.


395
00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.827
There's two faces.

396
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.264
No, it's one face
with two sides.


397
00:31:54.368 --> 00:31:56.268
On one side...

398
00:31:58.338 --> 00:31:59.999
there's violence.

399
00:32:02.809 --> 00:32:04.777
But not to her. It's...

400
00:32:06.847 --> 00:32:09.577
It's just to men who've
treated her unkindly.


401
00:32:09.683 --> 00:32:11.583
On the other...

402
00:32:15.088 --> 00:32:18.421
she's looking for love...

403
00:32:18.525 --> 00:32:22.256
but she's confused...

404
00:32:22.362 --> 00:32:24.262
'cause she...

405
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.664
well, 'cause she's
just looking for...


406
00:32:30.771 --> 00:32:32.966
she's just looking for it
in the wrong house.


407
00:32:33.073 --> 00:32:36.099
God love her.
I can't wait.


408
00:32:36.243 --> 00:32:38.939
You just stick close
to your front porch.


409
00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:41.445
You're gonna be cooking
for two real soon.


410
00:32:41.548 --> 00:32:45.985
Hey, do you think my husband would
like me in something like that?


411
00:32:47.921 --> 00:32:51.254
I mean, it's just
so sophisticated, and...


412
00:32:51.358 --> 00:32:52.689
you know.

413
00:32:52.793 --> 00:32:55.557
No.
I think you look great.


414
00:32:58.699 --> 00:33:00.360
What do I owe you?

415
00:33:00.467 --> 00:33:02.662
Oh, goodness, nothing.
It's a gift.


416
00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:04.327
Thanks.

417
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.603
- Thanks.
- See ya later.


418
00:33:09.743 --> 00:33:13.509
Marina, there's a lot of nuts
in this city.


419
00:33:13.613 --> 00:33:15.137
You don't want people
thinking you're one of them.


420
00:33:15.282 --> 00:33:17.944
So, how about, like...

421
00:33:18.051 --> 00:33:21.452
no more of this
hocus-pocus talk, huh?


422
00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:24.615
Goodness, Leo, I'm just
trying to help out.


423
00:33:24.725 --> 00:33:28.183
Honey, we're in the business
of selling meat, not giving advice.


424
00:33:28.295 --> 00:33:30.627
I got to tell you,
it's giving me the creeps.


425
00:33:33.133 --> 00:33:34.430
How come?

426
00:33:37.404 --> 00:33:38.871
I...

427
00:33:42.976 --> 00:33:44.409
You...

428
00:33:49.483 --> 00:33:51.610
I got to go get a drink.

429
00:34:36.163 --> 00:34:38.461
Hey, Leo.

430
00:34:38.565 --> 00:34:42.433
I just heard the news.
How's married life?


431
00:34:42.536 --> 00:34:44.663
Hit me, Luis, hard.

432
00:34:52.012 --> 00:34:53.502
Darling!

433
00:34:54.948 --> 00:34:57.109
Honey!

434
00:34:57.217 --> 00:34:59.151
Come over here, sweetheart.

435
00:35:08.595 --> 00:35:11.155
Molly, Gina.
How are you ladies this evening?


436
00:35:11.264 --> 00:35:14.756
Fine. Come.
Sit down. It's for you.


437
00:35:14.868 --> 00:35:16.631
Thank you.

438
00:35:17.971 --> 00:35:19.700
So...

439
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.774
how's love everlasting?

440
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:26.545
Oh, we're just
smoothing out the creases.


441
00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:29.376
Everything has a way of working
itself out, doesn't it?


442
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.480
A wedding present.
You need a mojo.


443
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:39.791
It's a sack of charms.

444
00:35:39.893 --> 00:35:42.794
Some herbs, dried flowers,
a little spice.


445
00:35:42.896 --> 00:35:47.629
Some roots, nut shells,
spider webs, candle wax.


446
00:35:47.734 --> 00:35:49.565
Personally, I like cumin.

447
00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:51.728
Yeah?
You use cumin?


448
00:35:51.838 --> 00:35:55.569
I never use cumin.
Goat's hair is nice.


449
00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:59.236
It helps clear up the vision,
so what you see is...


450
00:35:59.379 --> 00:36:01.244
What you end up getting.

451
00:36:01.348 --> 00:36:02.781
Exactly.

452
00:36:02.883 --> 00:36:05.545
Thank you, ladies.

453
00:36:05.652 --> 00:36:07.449
You know, though...

454
00:36:07.554 --> 00:36:10.216
what's meant to be
just can't be changed.


455
00:36:12.759 --> 00:36:16.286
Hard times demand an open mind.

456
00:36:16.396 --> 00:36:17.522
Wear it.

457
00:36:19.499 --> 00:36:23.196
Nice shoes, Alex.
Jackie Gleason collection?


458
00:36:23.303 --> 00:36:24.895
You like 'em?

459
00:36:27.174 --> 00:36:30.007
By the way, I can't go away
with you and Robyn next weekend.


460
00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.908
What do you mean you can't
go away next weekend?


461
00:36:33.013 --> 00:36:34.878
Something came up.

462
00:36:34.981 --> 00:36:36.812
I rented this house
five months ago.


463
00:36:36.917 --> 00:36:39.477
I've been looking forward
to this weekend together.


464
00:36:39.586 --> 00:36:40.917
It was unexpected.

465
00:36:41.021 --> 00:36:43.785
We're supposed to relax
and have fun, goddamn it.


466
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.290
I scheduled you a blind date
for Saturday night.


467
00:36:47.194 --> 00:36:49.458
I already have a date,
thank you.


468
00:36:49.563 --> 00:36:52.259
Oh, that's something else.

469
00:36:52.365 --> 00:36:54.833
- Bring her along.
- I don't know who she is yet.


470
00:36:57.304 --> 00:37:00.000
- I'm curious.
- Oh, no.


471
00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:02.006
No, no.
You have a date with somebody...


472
00:37:02.108 --> 00:37:03.598
but you don't know who it is.

473
00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:05.768
- Shut up and putt.
- No.


474
00:37:05.912 --> 00:37:07.436
I'm always interested
when my friends show...


475
00:37:07.581 --> 00:37:09.845
early signs of dementia praecox.

476
00:37:10.951 --> 00:37:13.545
Listen, Alex...

477
00:37:13.653 --> 00:37:17.020
I know it sounds flaky,
but I met this wonderful woman...


478
00:37:17.123 --> 00:37:19.182
and she says I'll be
cooking for two soon...


479
00:37:19.292 --> 00:37:21.192
and I really want to believe her.

480
00:37:21.294 --> 00:37:23.455
- Believe who?
- The butcher's wife.


481
00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:58.630
<i>I knew that one day...</i>

482
00:37:58.732 --> 00:38:00.393
<i>one day...</i>

483
00:38:00.533 --> 00:38:03.593
<i>I ran from you, Chauncey,</i>
<i>as far as I could.</i>


484
00:38:03.703 --> 00:38:06.035
<i>So why do I keep ending up</i>
<i>back in your arms?</i>


485
00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:08.266
<i>Because that's where</i>
<i>you were meant to be...</i>


486
00:38:08.375 --> 00:38:11.538
<i>safe and warm</i>
<i>in my sweet embrace.</i>


487
00:38:11.645 --> 00:38:14.637
<i>Come to Uncle Chauncey,</i>
<i>my little passion flower.</i>


488
00:38:14.748 --> 00:38:17.080
<i>I only want</i>
<i>what's best for us.</i>


489
00:38:24.858 --> 00:38:27.452
<i>I told you one of us</i>
<i>would end up hurt.</i>


490
00:38:29.696 --> 00:38:33.792
<i>Why does everything</i>
<i>I touch die?</i>


491
00:38:33.933 --> 00:38:35.491
It's the gun, sweetheart.

492
00:38:35.635 --> 00:38:38.832
- The gun.
- One little box he brings down!


493
00:38:38.938 --> 00:38:42.203
A big man like that, he brings
one box! One teeny little box!


494
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:45.472
Let's load this thing up!
I can't believe it.


495
00:38:45.578 --> 00:38:48.445
It's an awfully long distance
from Georgia.


496
00:38:50.183 --> 00:38:51.741
Hey, Eugene.

497
00:38:54.654 --> 00:38:57.714
I got this thing for you,
and I wanted to give it to you.


498
00:38:57.824 --> 00:39:01.624
I wanted you to open it here.

499
00:39:01.728 --> 00:39:04.697
- Thanks.
- Just a little present...


500
00:39:04.798 --> 00:39:08.256
but it means something special to
me, and I wanted to give it to you.


501
00:39:08.401 --> 00:39:11.768
Eugene, she's beautiful.
Come here.


502
00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:13.839
I named her Rosalita.

503
00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.534
She's so sweet.
Hey, Rosalita.


504
00:39:19.913 --> 00:39:21.005
You like her?

505
00:39:21.114 --> 00:39:25.016
Oh, she's beautiful.
Thank you so much.


506
00:39:25.118 --> 00:39:27.882
Eugene, you're late!
Get your butt in gear now!


507
00:39:27.987 --> 00:39:29.887
Go on.

508
00:39:31.825 --> 00:39:35.556
Leo, if you want
to pass words with me...


509
00:39:35.662 --> 00:39:37.630
will you please not
take it out on him?


510
00:39:39.399 --> 00:39:40.331
Bless you.

511
00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:42.992
Are you wearing some
new kind of perfume?


512
00:39:44.437 --> 00:39:47.338
I think you may be allergic
to my new mojo.


513
00:39:49.642 --> 00:39:51.405
Let me get you a tissue.

514
00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.913
- Here you go.
- What the hell is that?


515
00:39:57.016 --> 00:39:58.881
Oh, this is Rosalita.

516
00:39:58.985 --> 00:40:00.543
Isn't she sweet?

517
00:40:00.653 --> 00:40:03.645
What do you want
with a live chicken?


518
00:40:03.757 --> 00:40:05.691
No, don't tell me.

519
00:40:05.792 --> 00:40:08.920
Don't... Don't tell me.

520
00:40:09.062 --> 00:40:11.189
I don't want to know.

521
00:40:11.331 --> 00:40:14.391
Don't say nothing.
Just don't.


522
00:40:19.205 --> 00:40:21.696
It's just a little chick.

523
00:40:25.378 --> 00:40:29.337
I never thought I'd see
the inside of a shrink's office.


524
00:40:29.449 --> 00:40:31.917
It looks so normal.

525
00:40:32.018 --> 00:40:34.919
I was expecting something
a little more psycho.


526
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:36.420
Pervy, you know?

527
00:40:36.523 --> 00:40:38.718
Uh-huh.
How can I help you, Leo?


528
00:40:38.825 --> 00:40:40.622
I don't need help.
I'm normal.


529
00:40:45.198 --> 00:40:46.790
It's my wife.

530
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:53.163
I mean, I know we've only been
married for a couple of days...


531
00:40:53.273 --> 00:40:57.334
but I think she might be nuts,
if you know what I mean.


532
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:00.638
Yes.
I think I have an idea.


533
00:41:00.747 --> 00:41:03.477
Though "nuts" isn't a word
I'm comfortable with.


534
00:41:03.583 --> 00:41:05.380
Me neither.

535
00:41:06.886 --> 00:41:09.787
See, we got married real quick,
like the day we met.


536
00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:12.517
She insisted.

537
00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:16.686
Swear to God, she told me
I was the man of her dreams.


538
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.993
I had no idea
she really meant it.


539
00:41:20.133 --> 00:41:22.226
So we took some holy vows.

540
00:41:25.905 --> 00:41:28.703
I believe a man
is only as good as his vows...


541
00:41:28.808 --> 00:41:33.006
but now I think maybe she married me
'cause of these dreams of hers.


542
00:41:34.214 --> 00:41:36.682
She believes in 'em, Doc.

543
00:41:40.753 --> 00:41:42.653
It's not natural.

544
00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:46.054
It could be some sort of complex
in her head, right?


545
00:41:46.159 --> 00:41:48.093
Which means she's nuts.

546
00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:52.187
And if she's nuts, how do I
even know if she loves me?


547
00:41:55.335 --> 00:41:56.859
So I'm thinking...

548
00:41:58.037 --> 00:42:00.631
dreams, nuts...

549
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.503
Sounds like your field.

550
00:42:04.978 --> 00:42:08.141
And she's really
spooking me now, Doc.


551
00:42:08.248 --> 00:42:10.409
She's got some live
chicken running around...


552
00:42:10.517 --> 00:42:13.042
and she's wearing some
hojo around her neck.


553
00:42:13.152 --> 00:42:15.916
You gotta cure her,
or we're in big trouble.


554
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.849
Doc, I been to Brooklyn.
I know about voodoo.


555
00:42:47.754 --> 00:42:48.914
Hey, Leo.

556
00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.589
- Where's the new missus?
- She's fine, thanks.


557
00:42:53.693 --> 00:42:55.752
I said where.
Never mind.


558
00:42:55.895 --> 00:42:58.625
Make sure she
gets this, okay?


559
00:42:58.765 --> 00:43:00.960
Yeah, sure.

560
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.034
So when you going to
give it to her?


561
00:43:03.169 --> 00:43:05.763
- Don't worry.
- Do I look worried?


562
00:43:06.873 --> 00:43:11.469
It's a love token.
It'll seal your love forever.


563
00:43:25.959 --> 00:43:27.586
Jesus.
Oh, Mrs. Lemke.


564
00:43:29.662 --> 00:43:31.755
Did I...

565
00:43:31.898 --> 00:43:35.425
Oh, boy. Did, I...
Did I leave the door unlocked?


566
00:43:35.568 --> 00:43:38.298
Where's the couch?

567
00:43:38.404 --> 00:43:40.304
I don't use a couch.

568
00:43:42.108 --> 00:43:45.475
I don't know if you've ever been
in therapy before.


569
00:43:47.914 --> 00:43:51.179
- That's my chair.
- Oh, it is?


570
00:43:51.284 --> 00:43:53.184
Well, it's nice.

571
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.190
It's important you know...

572
00:43:59.292 --> 00:44:01.760
that I can be
of absolutely no help...


573
00:44:01.861 --> 00:44:04.091
unless you want to be here.

574
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:08.132
You, of course,
are free to go at any time.


575
00:44:08.234 --> 00:44:10.134
I promised Leo I'd come.

576
00:44:10.236 --> 00:44:12.830
Good. Why?

577
00:44:12.939 --> 00:44:16.670
Well, I expect he thinks
I'm a little touched.


578
00:44:16.776 --> 00:44:19.870
"Touched"? Interesting word.

579
00:44:19.979 --> 00:44:22.812
What exactly does it mean to you?

580
00:44:22.915 --> 00:44:26.282
Well, that's a fine question.

581
00:44:26.386 --> 00:44:29.412
I reckon it's 'cause I know things
before he does...


582
00:44:29.522 --> 00:44:31.649
and that just
gives him the shivers.


583
00:44:33.259 --> 00:44:34.851
Yes.

584
00:44:36.696 --> 00:44:40.257
Well, come on.
Women have been burned for less.


585
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.301
So you know things.

586
00:44:43.403 --> 00:44:45.735
Like telling a total stranger
that she should...


587
00:44:45.838 --> 00:44:48.068
get up in front
of a crowd and sing...


588
00:44:48.174 --> 00:44:50.335
when she might not be ready
for such a bold move...


589
00:44:50.443 --> 00:44:52.877
and is liable to get
terribly discouraged.


590
00:44:54.013 --> 00:44:55.981
You know Stella?

591
00:44:56.082 --> 00:44:58.983
Or telling a lonely woman that she
should wait for love to find her...


592
00:44:59.085 --> 00:45:01.212
when she'd be better off
getting out there and finding...


593
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.685
But that's all true.

594
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.983
Or telling my girlfriend
that she should marry me.


595
00:45:06.092 --> 00:45:07.582
Now, here we go again.

596
00:45:07.694 --> 00:45:09.594
No. People...

597
00:45:09.729 --> 00:45:12.129
I can't help
what I see, can I?


598
00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:14.062
But you can help what you say.

599
00:45:18.538 --> 00:45:22.201
Do you have visions?
Do you hear voices?


600
00:45:22.308 --> 00:45:24.776
Premonitions?

601
00:45:24.877 --> 00:45:26.777
Do you roller-skate?

602
00:45:31.017 --> 00:45:34.145
How exactly does roller-skating
figure into your gift?


603
00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:37.450
Oh, it doesn't.
I just wanted to have a little fun.


604
00:45:38.825 --> 00:45:42.386
Yeah, well, it is highly unorthodox
to leave the office with a patient.


605
00:45:42.495 --> 00:45:45.362
I'm not your patient, Doctor.
I'm doing it for Leo.


606
00:45:45.465 --> 00:45:48.957
If you want to hear how crazy I am,
you better just lace up.


607
00:45:54.173 --> 00:45:56.437
What am I doing here?

608
00:45:56.542 --> 00:46:00.171
Some crazy woman in the clothing
store put me up to this.


609
00:46:00.279 --> 00:46:02.770
No wonder I'm in therapy.
I'm too impressionable.


610
00:46:02.882 --> 00:46:04.782
Don't you think?

611
00:46:04.884 --> 00:46:06.112
You'll be great.

612
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.258
If only I were black,
I'd feel so much better.


613
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:14.791
Luis, rye and soda.
Hold the soda.


614
00:46:14.894 --> 00:46:16.156
Make it a double.

615
00:46:16.262 --> 00:46:18.162
I don't want to talk about women...

616
00:46:18.264 --> 00:46:21.165
and I don't want to
talk about my wife.


617
00:46:21.267 --> 00:46:22.996
Oh, you're married?

618
00:46:23.102 --> 00:46:26.970
Leo, this is Stella Kefauver,
our new lounge act.


619
00:46:27.073 --> 00:46:29.007
She's gonna class up the joint.

620
00:46:29.108 --> 00:46:31.702
You got your work cut out for you.

621
00:46:33.479 --> 00:46:35.106
Hit me again, Luis.

622
00:46:36.249 --> 00:46:38.376
Bessie Smith?

623
00:46:38.518 --> 00:46:42.284
You sing Bessie Smith?
A skinny little thing like you?


624
00:46:42.388 --> 00:46:45.289
- Okay, I'll sing the Debby Boone.
- No, no, no.


625
00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:47.319
I love Bessie.

626
00:46:48.928 --> 00:46:51.419
Stella, you're on.

627
00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:08.138
You're welcome.

628
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.664
You been holding out
on me, Luis?


629
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:32.670
What do you think?

630
00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:40.607
Good evening.
For my first selection...


631
00:47:40.746 --> 00:47:42.839
I would like to sing
"In the Dark."


632
00:47:45.985 --> 00:47:49.421
<i>In the dark</i>

633
00:47:49.555 --> 00:47:51.250
<i>It's just...</i>

634
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.284
Sorry.

635
00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:57.453
It's all right.
It's okay.


636
00:47:58.631 --> 00:48:00.394
Oh, boy.

637
00:48:00.499 --> 00:48:03.127
<i>In the dark</i>

638
00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.901
<i>It's just you and I</i>

639
00:48:10.076 --> 00:48:12.044
<i>Not a sound</i>

640
00:48:12.144 --> 00:48:16.046
<i>There's not one sigh</i>

641
00:48:17.984 --> 00:48:23.889
<i>Just the beat of my poor heart</i>

642
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.754
<i>In the dark</i>

643
00:48:32.398 --> 00:48:35.196
<i>But soon</i>

644
00:48:35.301 --> 00:48:39.704
<i>This dance will be ending</i>

645
00:48:40.806 --> 00:48:45.072
<i>And we're gonna be missed</i>

646
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.371
<i>Gee</i>

647
00:48:50.516 --> 00:48:54.748
<i>But I'm not pretending</i>

648
00:48:54.854 --> 00:48:59.120
<i>'Cause I swear it's fun</i>

649
00:48:59.225 --> 00:49:01.420
<i>Fun to be kissed</i>

650
00:49:01.527 --> 00:49:04.724
<i>Oh, in the dark</i>

651
00:49:06.265 --> 00:49:09.291
<i>Now we will find</i>

652
00:49:11.003 --> 00:49:13.597
<i>What the rest</i>

653
00:49:13.706 --> 00:49:16.937
<i>Have left behind</i>

654
00:49:18.544 --> 00:49:21.012
<i>Just let them dance</i>

655
00:49:22.415 --> 00:49:26.977
<i>We're gonna find romance</i>

656
00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:29.815
<i>In the dark</i>

657
00:49:53.646 --> 00:49:55.273
Boy, I miss the wind.

658
00:49:57.483 --> 00:49:59.883
You know, no wind
will make you stale.


659
00:50:01.187 --> 00:50:03.747
You were going to explain to me...

660
00:50:03.856 --> 00:50:06.586
about the mechanics
of your clairvoyance.


661
00:50:06.692 --> 00:50:09.092
You know,
it's so good to cut loose.


662
00:50:09.195 --> 00:50:11.095
Yeah. It sure is.

663
00:50:12.565 --> 00:50:15.557
Mrs. Lemke, come on.
I promised your husband.


664
00:50:15.668 --> 00:50:17.192
Please.

665
00:50:17.303 --> 00:50:18.736
Okay.

666
00:50:21.007 --> 00:50:22.907
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.


667
00:50:26.012 --> 00:50:29.948
It's like you're standing
in the middle of a doughnut.


668
00:50:30.082 --> 00:50:32.141
And depending on which way you turn,
you can tell...


669
00:50:32.284 --> 00:50:34.184
what's going on in folks' lives.

670
00:50:34.286 --> 00:50:38.814
If you lean one way,
it's like "whoosh."


671
00:50:38.924 --> 00:50:41.290
You just catch
a piece of the past.


672
00:50:42.294 --> 00:50:44.524
And if you turn yourself a bit...

673
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.791
you'll bump right into the future.

674
00:50:46.899 --> 00:50:50.699
But it's like somebody's running me
my own private picture show...


675
00:50:50.803 --> 00:50:52.498
in stops and starts.

676
00:50:53.672 --> 00:50:55.606
I'm curious.
What do you mean, "picture show"?


677
00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:59.971
Here. Give me your hands.

678
00:51:05.418 --> 00:51:07.318
Well, there's the sea...

679
00:51:09.455 --> 00:51:11.320
and your little naked body...

680
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:14.786
and you're curling
your toes up in the sand.


681
00:51:19.832 --> 00:51:22.164
White flowers at a funeral.

682
00:51:24.303 --> 00:51:25.930
Your mama.

683
00:51:27.106 --> 00:51:30.735
She's real glad that she gave you
that red drum set.


684
00:51:35.047 --> 00:51:38.312
And there you are, barely six.

685
00:51:38.417 --> 00:51:42.114
You've got
these red bumps all over...


686
00:51:42.221 --> 00:51:45.520
and they're just making you itch.

687
00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:47.683
You just want to scratch.

688
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:51.459
Seven.

689
00:51:51.564 --> 00:51:53.998
I was...

690
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.226
I was seven.

691
00:52:10.816 --> 00:52:16.482
<i>Move me again</i>
<i>because I don't care</i>


692
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:20.548
<i>Move me 'cause I don't care</i>

693
00:52:42.581 --> 00:52:45.846
Luis, champagne
for Mrs. Kefauver.


694
00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:48.078
Miss. And call me Stella.

695
00:52:48.187 --> 00:52:51.816
Champagne? What do you
think this is, the Copa?


696
00:52:51.924 --> 00:52:54.188
We got Bud Light on draft.

697
00:52:54.293 --> 00:52:57.490
Stella, you are music to my ears.

698
00:52:57.596 --> 00:52:59.894
Gorgeous.
You sing like an angel.


699
00:52:59.999 --> 00:53:02.024
A choir of angels.

700
00:53:02.134 --> 00:53:03.829
Thank you so much.

701
00:53:03.936 --> 00:53:06.302
You are some sort of singer, lady.

702
00:53:06.405 --> 00:53:07.565
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


703
00:53:07.673 --> 00:53:10.767
You know, I hear your songs...

704
00:53:10.876 --> 00:53:12.901
and I get pictures in my head.

705
00:53:13.045 --> 00:53:16.378
All soft and dreamy.
Like the movies.


706
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.880
Leo, do you really think so?

707
00:53:23.989 --> 00:53:27.618
There aren't many of us that like
blues. We got to stick together.


708
00:53:30.596 --> 00:53:32.359
I'd like that.

709
00:53:41.941 --> 00:53:45.104
This ain't the kind of place
I imagined you working at.


710
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:47.907
You imagined me?

711
00:53:48.013 --> 00:53:50.447
Yeah. Sure.

712
00:53:52.184 --> 00:53:55.676
But I always thought
you blues singers...


713
00:53:55.788 --> 00:53:59.349
slept all day
and stayed out all night.


714
00:53:59.458 --> 00:54:01.221
- And lived in Paris.
- Yeah.


715
00:54:01.327 --> 00:54:02.555
I know.

716
00:54:02.661 --> 00:54:06.495
And now I'm here teaching holy music
to pimply-faced kids.


717
00:54:20.479 --> 00:54:22.276
So, Leo...

718
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:24.508
what's on your mind?

719
00:54:24.617 --> 00:54:27.381
I got to tell you something.

720
00:54:27.486 --> 00:54:29.386
Sure. Anything.

721
00:54:30.422 --> 00:54:31.855
It's about my wife.

722
00:54:34.693 --> 00:54:37.218
The thing is...

723
00:54:37.363 --> 00:54:40.025
I don't think we got married
for the right reasons.


724
00:54:40.165 --> 00:54:44.261
It seemed to make sense when
she proposed, but... I don't know.


725
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.736
Maybe I just don't know
how to be her husband.


726
00:54:46.839 --> 00:54:49.672
Since I brought her back here,
nothing's been working out.


727
00:54:51.076 --> 00:54:52.941
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

728
00:54:53.045 --> 00:54:57.982
No. She keeps telling me
I'm the man she was meant to marry.


729
00:54:58.083 --> 00:54:59.983
The thing is...

730
00:55:04.023 --> 00:55:06.423
Stella, I know
it's not right, but...


731
00:55:10.562 --> 00:55:12.757
I got this feeling for you.

732
00:55:20.639 --> 00:55:23.005
I got the same feeling too.

733
00:55:32.251 --> 00:55:34.151
But my wife...

734
00:55:35.954 --> 00:55:38.752
she's so fragile.

735
00:55:38.857 --> 00:55:40.757
It would send her
right off the deep end.


736
00:55:40.859 --> 00:55:42.759
A short trip for her.

737
00:55:45.698 --> 00:55:47.165
You're right.

738
00:55:48.567 --> 00:55:50.797
We'll have a higher love.

739
00:55:52.538 --> 00:55:56.975
We won't wallow in the degradation
of earthly desires.


740
00:55:57.076 --> 00:55:59.806
Jesus, you even talk like an angel.

741
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:19.654
A toad.

742
00:56:21.633 --> 00:56:24.568
I don't know what to say.

743
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:25.898
How...

744
00:56:27.139 --> 00:56:28.834
How thoughtful.

745
00:56:35.848 --> 00:56:39.409
It's hard to get your bearings
when you can't even see the stars.


746
00:56:39.518 --> 00:56:42.282
Yes. Yes.

747
00:56:43.655 --> 00:56:46.556
The other night,
you were looking for the stars...


748
00:56:46.658 --> 00:56:48.421
in your nightgown.

749
00:56:50.662 --> 00:56:52.653
You were watching me?

750
00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:00.834
Last week I saw something
I still don't believe...


751
00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:03.032
and I've studied the stars
since I was a kid.


752
00:57:03.142 --> 00:57:06.373
I saw a twin-tailed comet
just... right in.


753
00:57:06.478 --> 00:57:08.742
Really? Me too.

754
00:57:08.847 --> 00:57:11.714
That was my definite sign
that love was on its way.


755
00:57:14.219 --> 00:57:17.416
How exactly did you
come to marry Leo?


756
00:57:17.523 --> 00:57:19.684
I was supposed to marry Leo.

757
00:57:21.293 --> 00:57:24.319
I knew it when I saw his
smile in my dreams.


758
00:57:24.463 --> 00:57:26.055
He's my split-apart.

759
00:57:27.399 --> 00:57:28.593
What's a split-apart?

760
00:57:29.935 --> 00:57:31.994
Long ago before man and woman...

761
00:57:32.137 --> 00:57:34.298
when time was young,
there were these beings.


762
00:57:34.406 --> 00:57:36.601
- Beans?
- Beings.


763
00:57:36.708 --> 00:57:39.939
Oh. Beings.
Yeah.


764
00:57:40.045 --> 00:57:43.276
Right.
So we were kind of odd-looking...


765
00:57:43.382 --> 00:57:46.283
but just as happy
as pigs in a puddle...


766
00:57:46.385 --> 00:57:48.853
and we didn't need
no one for nothing, and...


767
00:57:48.954 --> 00:57:53.118
And we could reproduce
by ourselves and... Yeah.


768
00:57:53.225 --> 00:57:56.353
You don't know this story.

769
00:57:56.462 --> 00:57:58.430
- You can't.
- I do. I do.


770
00:57:58.564 --> 00:58:00.429
Go ahead. Try me.

771
00:58:00.532 --> 00:58:02.625
Okay.

772
00:58:02.768 --> 00:58:05.134
The spirits
that ruled the world then...


773
00:58:05.237 --> 00:58:07.262
Envied our joy and independence.

774
00:58:07.372 --> 00:58:10.205
And so they split us apart.

775
00:58:16.081 --> 00:58:20.745
Like clams on a half shell
and then scattered us to the wind.


776
00:58:22.688 --> 00:58:25.179
You can still see the scar...

777
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:27.986
which, of course, is the...

778
00:58:28.093 --> 00:58:30.391
navel.

779
00:58:36.101 --> 00:58:38.535
Right.
The bellybutton.


780
00:58:47.045 --> 00:58:49.707
You were saying.

781
00:58:49.815 --> 00:58:52.215
So we're the kinfolk
of these old split-aparts...


782
00:58:52.317 --> 00:58:55.878
and mostly we're miserable
on account of we spend our lives...


783
00:58:55.988 --> 00:58:58.718
Iooking for our
long-lost other half.


784
00:58:58.824 --> 00:59:02.316
And sometimes...

785
00:59:02.427 --> 00:59:07.558
getting so caught up in that search
for that special person that...


786
00:59:07.699 --> 00:59:09.599
they don't even notice.

787
00:59:09.701 --> 00:59:10.929
Boom, there they are.

788
00:59:11.036 --> 00:59:12.970
Right before their very eyes.

789
00:59:16.475 --> 00:59:19.273
- How'd you know this?
- Magic.


790
00:59:21.179 --> 00:59:23.010
I never would've thought
you had it in ya.


791
00:59:24.283 --> 00:59:25.841
Actually, everybody knows it.

792
00:59:25.951 --> 00:59:27.578
It's Plato.

793
00:59:27.686 --> 00:59:31.383
It's a corruption, of course,
but Plato nonetheless.


794
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.220
Well, my grammy told it to me.

795
00:59:34.326 --> 00:59:36.226
She must be well-read.

796
00:59:36.328 --> 00:59:38.228
Blind since birth.

797
00:59:41.767 --> 00:59:45.999
I've never met anyone
quite like you, Mrs. Lemke.


798
00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:49.402
You ought to get out more.

799
00:59:49.508 --> 00:59:53.274
And you can call me Marina.

800
00:59:57.916 --> 01:00:00.043
Marina... It's pretty.

801
01:00:00.152 --> 01:00:01.585
It's pretty.

802
01:00:16.768 --> 01:00:18.235
Look, Marina.

803
01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.574
Fooling yourself into believing
you married Leo...


804
01:00:23.675 --> 01:00:25.802
because your grammy
screwed up Plato, that's...


805
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:27.811
that's dangerous territory.

806
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:31.843
Well, I appreciate
your concern, Doctor...


807
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:34.544
but I wouldn't expect a man
like you to understand.


808
01:00:34.653 --> 01:00:36.280
Oh, no, I do understand.

809
01:00:36.388 --> 01:00:38.879
And I want you to understand,
because your impulsive behavior...


810
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:41.255
is jeopardizing your marriage.

811
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.693
- Perhaps Leo just showed up...
- He didn't just show up.


812
01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:47.663
How the hell you think he got
to Ocracoke in the first place?


813
01:00:47.766 --> 01:00:52.100
- I suggested he take a vacation.
- It was his destiny.


814
01:00:52.204 --> 01:00:55.469
Mrs. Lemke, these delusions
are not healthy.


815
01:00:55.574 --> 01:00:58.168
- I can help...
- You know what? You don't know zip...


816
01:00:58.276 --> 01:00:59.937
about love or life, Doctor...

817
01:01:00.045 --> 01:01:02.741
and I don't need you strewing
your learning all over me.


818
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:07.614
Do not walk away from this!
These fantasies...


819
01:01:07.719 --> 01:01:11.155
Your fantasies of being all-seeing
and all-powerful are dangerous...


820
01:01:11.256 --> 01:01:12.689
and they're...

821
01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:16.352
It's just a hell of a way
to run your life!


822
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:19.692
My God, you didn't dream
Leo into your life...


823
01:01:19.831 --> 01:01:22.994
Of course I did.
I just made a mistake.


824
01:01:30.108 --> 01:01:32.576
It's all right.
It's okay. That's...


825
01:01:34.146 --> 01:01:37.138
Awareness is the first
and most difficult step.


826
01:01:40.385 --> 01:01:41.784
Honestly, I...

827
01:01:42.954 --> 01:01:46.219
I understand what it's like
to think you know everything.


828
01:01:49.861 --> 01:01:51.556
It's really terrible.
I've made a wreck...


829
01:01:51.697 --> 01:01:55.030
of Leo's life and my life
and two innocent strangers.


830
01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:57.567
I've really got to go
figure this out...


831
01:01:57.669 --> 01:01:59.193
and...

832
01:02:00.472 --> 01:02:02.201
fix it.

833
01:02:14.553 --> 01:02:18.751
You ended up skating
in the park with a patient.


834
01:02:18.857 --> 01:02:20.984
It's classic countertransference.

835
01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.056
You allowed her to manipulate you

836
01:02:25.163 --> 01:02:29.759
into a vulnerable...
never mind unprofessional... situation...


837
01:02:29.868 --> 01:02:32.769
where she controlled you.

838
01:02:32.871 --> 01:02:35.237
This is freshman psychology, Alex.

839
01:02:39.311 --> 01:02:42.542
Oh, good. Oh, good. Good.

840
01:02:42.647 --> 01:02:44.205
Dr. Tremor...

841
01:02:45.817 --> 01:02:48.115
don't blow a great career
on a cute piece of ass.


842
01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.882
You keep your dick
in your pants...


843
01:02:50.989 --> 01:02:52.081
your id in check...

844
01:02:53.258 --> 01:02:56.125
and you remember
that we have a mission...


845
01:02:56.228 --> 01:02:57.855
in this world.

846
01:03:00.398 --> 01:03:02.366
Did you sleep well?

847
01:03:02.467 --> 01:03:04.435
I didn't hear you
come in last night.


848
01:03:04.536 --> 01:03:06.060
I didn't want to wake you.

849
01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:09.571
Lend me a hand with this?
It's stuck.


850
01:03:24.656 --> 01:03:26.556
Are you trying to tell me something?

851
01:03:27.959 --> 01:03:29.859
No.
You trying to tell me something?


852
01:03:29.961 --> 01:03:31.690
No.

853
01:03:31.797 --> 01:03:33.196
Say it with flowers?

854
01:03:39.905 --> 01:03:41.668
For the first time...

855
01:03:41.807 --> 01:03:45.641
I can almost imagine
a world without therapy.


856
01:03:45.744 --> 01:03:46.676
Amen.

857
01:03:46.778 --> 01:03:50.509
Well, I'm glad our time together
is having such a positive effect.


858
01:03:50.615 --> 01:03:54.608
It's been good,
but I owe this one to that psychic.


859
01:03:54.719 --> 01:03:57.779
I thought we dealt with that.

860
01:03:57.889 --> 01:04:00.687
Don't worry. It's not like
I'm cured or anything.


861
01:04:00.792 --> 01:04:03.522
Good.
Well, not good...


862
01:04:11.303 --> 01:04:14.795
Forgive me, Doctor,
for I have sinned.


863
01:04:16.508 --> 01:04:20.672
But he is such a good man,
and I think he really likes me.


864
01:04:20.779 --> 01:04:22.576
Is he married?

865
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:28.249
Well, yes. But...

866
01:04:29.254 --> 01:04:30.812
his wife's not well...

867
01:04:30.922 --> 01:04:33.789
which, of course,
fills me with guilt.


868
01:04:33.892 --> 01:04:37.885
But she's making him miserable,
so I rationalize...


869
01:04:37.996 --> 01:04:39.623
by figuring that...

870
01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:42.291
I'm bringing some
well-earned joy to his life.


871
01:04:45.036 --> 01:04:47.095
You're disappointed, aren't you?

872
01:04:47.239 --> 01:04:48.866
I'm curious.

873
01:04:49.574 --> 01:04:53.408
Oh, no. You wouldn't be
if you knew him.


874
01:04:53.511 --> 01:04:56.105
I mean, this is it.

875
01:04:56.214 --> 01:04:59.047
You always know when the right person
walks into your life.


876
01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:01.812
I always know when
the wrong person walks in...


877
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.946
and it doesn't feel
that way at all, so...


878
01:05:05.056 --> 01:05:07.081
I'm sure Leo's the one.

879
01:05:09.828 --> 01:05:10.852
Leo?

880
01:05:10.962 --> 01:05:13.590
That's his name... Leo.

881
01:05:16.902 --> 01:05:19.803
I really think you'd like him.

882
01:05:30.215 --> 01:05:33.514
- Here's your hot dogs.
- No, no, sweetheart. Chops.


883
01:05:33.618 --> 01:05:35.245
- Chops.
- Chops.


884
01:05:36.955 --> 01:05:41.289
Great sign.
Really makes you want to come in here.


885
01:05:41.393 --> 01:05:44.362
- Oh. It's you.
- Hi.


886
01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:47.920
I didn't know you worked here.

887
01:05:48.033 --> 01:05:51.332
- How'd that dress work out?
- Great.


888
01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.528
Everything's working out great.

889
01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:58.075
Thanks to you, I'm singing
at this cabaret. Dellago's?


890
01:05:58.176 --> 01:06:01.304
Oh, I know that place.
My husband likes it.


891
01:06:01.413 --> 01:06:03.574
Okay, it's a bar.

892
01:06:05.383 --> 01:06:09.820
But I met this
really wonderful man.


893
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:13.319
Hey, maybe you can
tell me if we're going to...


894
01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:15.325
Oh, no. Never mind.

895
01:06:15.427 --> 01:06:17.554
I don't want to know.
Just pray for me.


896
01:06:17.662 --> 01:06:20.893
Pray for all of us, darling.

897
01:06:20.999 --> 01:06:24.162
Would it be all right
if I put up a flyer?


898
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:26.635
Well, sure. I'd be proud.

899
01:06:26.771 --> 01:06:28.898
I've got to tell Leo
to get up there to see you.


900
01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.907
He just loves that old stuff.

901
01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.537
Leo?

902
01:06:36.648 --> 01:06:38.138
My husband.

903
01:06:39.651 --> 01:06:41.278
That'll be 10.

904
01:06:50.528 --> 01:06:51.961
Well, see ya.

905
01:06:54.699 --> 01:06:56.496
Uh, 10.

906
01:07:04.242 --> 01:07:07.302
I've got to find a wife
for my husband.


907
01:07:08.813 --> 01:07:10.610
Why not?

908
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:13.774
Thanks.

909
01:07:17.322 --> 01:07:20.314
Out of my way, asshole.

910
01:07:20.425 --> 01:07:21.551
Guess.

911
01:07:29.834 --> 01:07:33.065
Would you fancy meeting
a cuddly middle-aged man?


912
01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:36.563
Sorry. I like them
young and talented.


913
01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:38.608
I never go on dates
arranged by my butcher...


914
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.110
but I'd be interested in meeting
the artist who did your window.


915
01:07:41.212 --> 01:07:43.339
Is he young?

916
01:07:43.448 --> 01:07:44.710
Take my card.

917
01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:50.986
Your change.

918
01:07:51.089 --> 01:07:53.990
What I wouldn't give
for just a little breeze.


919
01:07:54.092 --> 01:07:55.992
Not till September
at the earliest.


920
01:07:56.094 --> 01:07:58.119
So now you're doing the weather?

921
01:08:13.945 --> 01:08:17.210
The face of God
is a one-way mirror.


922
01:08:26.758 --> 01:08:29.625
You're not listening to me!
I knew it!


923
01:08:36.334 --> 01:08:40.395
You're absolutely correct,
and I apologize.


924
01:08:42.173 --> 01:08:43.800
Excuse me.

925
01:08:43.942 --> 01:08:46.172
You're still not listening to me.

926
01:08:48.346 --> 01:08:50.507
- Leo.
- You're in. Good.


927
01:08:50.615 --> 01:08:52.742
What the hell did
you do to my wife?

928
01:08:52.851 --> 01:08:55.911
- I am with a patient.
- Your fruitcake can wait. Mine can't.


929
01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.614
You got her trying to fix me up
with strange women.


930
01:08:58.723 --> 01:09:00.918
I don't know what kind of advice
you're giving out...


931
01:09:01.025 --> 01:09:03.721
but a few more visits with you,
we can book her a room in Bellevue!


932
01:09:03.828 --> 01:09:05.489
Wait a second!
I am not...


933
01:09:05.597 --> 01:09:08.760
Just stay the hell
away from her, okay?


934
01:09:08.867 --> 01:09:10.767
You're a dangerous man.

935
01:09:19.777 --> 01:09:22.769
- Your clock's stuck.
- I don't want to talk about it!


936
01:09:28.353 --> 01:09:29.945
Where's Alex?

937
01:09:30.054 --> 01:09:31.954
He's seeing some lunatic.

938
01:09:34.959 --> 01:09:39.419
Doctor's wife is not one
of my featured roles.


939
01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:43.558
God, Grace, what am I going to do?

940
01:09:43.668 --> 01:09:47.035
- What?
- I proposed to him the other night.


941
01:09:47.172 --> 01:09:49.299
- No.
- Yes.


942
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.036
I can't believe it either,
but I met the most incredible woman.


943
01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:56.477
She just opened my eyes.

944
01:09:56.581 --> 01:09:57.741
Me too.

945
01:09:58.983 --> 01:10:01.110
Oh, yeah?
You're seeing someone new?


946
01:10:01.219 --> 01:10:04.722
No. This new girl that works
at the butcher shop.


947
01:10:04.856 --> 01:10:07.689
My God. Marina.

948
01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:09.726
She's incredible.

949
01:10:09.827 --> 01:10:12.125
- Is she for real?
- Absolutely.


950
01:10:14.566 --> 01:10:18.434
- What did she tell you?
- To stick close to my front porch.


951
01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:21.767
That's why I canceled
my weekend with you guys...


952
01:10:21.906 --> 01:10:24.067
to wait for my mystery date.

953
01:10:24.175 --> 01:10:26.075
Hey.
You think I'm nuts?


954
01:10:26.177 --> 01:10:29.203
Grace, that's fabulous.

955
01:10:29.314 --> 01:10:31.407
Alex thinks I'm insane.

956
01:10:31.516 --> 01:10:33.484
It's his favorite diagnosis.

957
01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.953
Why do we waste
our time with men?


958
01:10:39.057 --> 01:10:41.617
Not all of us do.

959
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:10.347
Oh, Chauncey,
don't touch me there.


960
01:12:41.512 --> 01:12:42.740
Mrs. Lemke.

961
01:12:45.116 --> 01:12:47.141
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.


962
01:12:47.251 --> 01:12:49.151
I need to see you.

963
01:12:49.253 --> 01:12:50.811
- Oh, well...
- Now.


964
01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:56.817
Why don't we just
go to my office?


965
01:12:56.928 --> 01:12:58.657
Okay.

966
01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.564
I was going to talk to you
in the morning.


967
01:13:04.702 --> 01:13:06.135
We need to...

968
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:08.738
We need to be clear
about last night.


969
01:13:10.842 --> 01:13:13.675
I acted inappropriately.

970
01:13:13.778 --> 01:13:17.270
I never should have seen you
under duress.


971
01:13:17.382 --> 01:13:19.282
That was unprofessional.

972
01:13:27.191 --> 01:13:31.025
I never should have allowed
the session to leave the office.


973
01:13:31.129 --> 01:13:32.858
- That was inexcusable.
- Doctor...


974
01:13:32.964 --> 01:13:35.262
Worst of all, I had no business
offering you...


975
01:13:35.366 --> 01:13:37.266
a quick-fix analysis of your marriage.

976
01:13:37.368 --> 01:13:39.700
Dr. Tremor,
I saw you in my dreams tonight.


977
01:13:41.439 --> 01:13:44.636
Oh, sure.
That's not uncommon.


978
01:13:44.742 --> 01:13:48.473
Dreams are important.
And you know...


979
01:13:48.579 --> 01:13:50.547
you can keep a little
notebook by the bed...


980
01:13:50.648 --> 01:13:54.311
and just write them down
if you're afraid of...


981
01:13:54.419 --> 01:13:56.046
What was I doing?

982
01:13:56.154 --> 01:13:57.746
Smiling.

983
01:14:04.295 --> 01:14:06.763
Look, Mrs. Lemke...
Marina.


984
01:14:06.864 --> 01:14:08.729
All right, listen.

985
01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:11.267
I can't deny that I feel
an attraction for you.


986
01:14:11.402 --> 01:14:13.370
But don't worry.
I know what it is...


987
01:14:13.504 --> 01:14:15.597
and how to remedy the situation.

988
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:19.403
There's no cure. Last night,
just for a moment, you knew it.


989
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:21.535
Love is the leap
that won't be denied.


990
01:14:21.646 --> 01:14:23.204
No, no.
This isn't love.


991
01:14:23.314 --> 01:14:26.010
This is what
we doctors like to call...


992
01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.184
I'll think of it.
Countertransference!


993
01:14:31.289 --> 01:14:33.257
You're not listening to me.

994
01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:36.758
Yes, I am,
and I understand exactly...


995
01:14:36.861 --> 01:14:38.328
why you're doing this.

996
01:14:39.597 --> 01:14:40.996
You do?

997
01:14:41.098 --> 01:14:42.656
Yes.

998
01:14:44.702 --> 01:14:46.135
To get even.

999
01:14:47.472 --> 01:14:48.666
What for?

1000
01:14:48.806 --> 01:14:52.264
Because you're angry at your husband
for commencing an extramarital affair.


1001
01:14:55.613 --> 01:14:57.080
What?

1002
01:14:57.181 --> 01:14:58.239
Yes.

1003
01:15:01.486 --> 01:15:03.386
Leo's seeing another woman?

1004
01:15:03.488 --> 01:15:04.819
Yes.

1005
01:15:06.724 --> 01:15:09.215
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.


1006
01:15:09.327 --> 01:15:11.818
Well, if he was, I would.

1007
01:15:14.332 --> 01:15:15.663
Who is she?

1008
01:15:17.969 --> 01:15:20.665
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that.


1009
01:15:20.805 --> 01:15:24.206
I can't believe
he's seeing another woman.


1010
01:15:24.342 --> 01:15:27.368
My God, we've only been married,
what, three days?


1011
01:15:27.478 --> 01:15:30.606
Marina, last night, you yourself said
you'd made a mistake.


1012
01:15:30.715 --> 01:15:32.410
Yes, but it was my mistake...

1013
01:15:32.517 --> 01:15:35.213
and I was doing the fixing.

1014
01:15:35.319 --> 01:15:38.186
And I'm gonna be the one deciding
who my husband should marry.


1015
01:15:56.274 --> 01:15:58.333
Honey, we got to talk.

1016
01:15:58.476 --> 01:16:02.640
I heard you yesterday,
you know, when you were talking.


1017
01:16:04.282 --> 01:16:07.809
So I suppose I've been wasting my time
trying to find you the right wife.


1018
01:16:07.919 --> 01:16:10.979
Of course you are, honey.
I've got a good wife.


1019
01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:13.420
And we can work things out.
Don't worry.


1020
01:16:13.524 --> 01:16:16.721
- I may be simple, but I'm not stupid.
- What's that supposed to mean?


1021
01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:19.421
I suppose lying and cheating
ain't in your vocabulary.


1022
01:16:21.799 --> 01:16:23.323
Another day, another dollar.

1023
01:16:23.434 --> 01:16:25.561
Eugene, I want
that money back in the till.


1024
01:16:25.703 --> 01:16:27.694
What's a till?

1025
01:16:28.773 --> 01:16:31.435
You know I know. You want to
borrow money, that's one thing.


1026
01:16:31.542 --> 01:16:34.170
- But I've got no time for thieving.
- Honey.


1027
01:16:34.278 --> 01:16:38.146
- What are you talking about?
- We're $50 short from last night.


1028
01:16:38.249 --> 01:16:40.843
Honey, is this what
you're looking for?


1029
01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:57.633
Why don't you get a couch, Doc?

1030
01:17:00.538 --> 01:17:02.335
I need some advice.

1031
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.670
You remember I was telling you
about that girl I like?


1032
01:17:04.775 --> 01:17:06.640
Right.

1033
01:17:07.778 --> 01:17:10.440
She's got one of
these "Sybil" things going now.


1034
01:17:10.548 --> 01:17:13.244
One day she treats me
like I'm Romeo...


1035
01:17:13.351 --> 01:17:16.980
the next day she treats me
like I'm public enemy number one.


1036
01:17:17.088 --> 01:17:18.612
I can't figure it out.

1037
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:23.692
The female psyche has eluded men
since the beginning of time, Eugene.


1038
01:17:23.794 --> 01:17:25.955
Nice tone, Doc.
Feeling hostile?


1039
01:17:26.063 --> 01:17:28.725
Yes... No.

1040
01:17:28.833 --> 01:17:32.200
- We're not here to talk about me.
- That's right. It's my dime.


1041
01:17:32.336 --> 01:17:35.635
I'm thinking about
my male pride with this girl.


1042
01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.800
Maybe I got to dump her.
Then I'm thinking, no...


1043
01:17:38.943 --> 01:17:41.377
maybe I ought to give her
another chance.


1044
01:17:41.479 --> 01:17:45.074
Maybe I got to go for broke,
maybe even ask her out.


1045
01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:49.119
- So?
- So what if she says no?


1046
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:53.316
Eugene, when confronted
with a risky proposition...


1047
01:17:53.424 --> 01:17:55.790
Doc, 10 words or less.
I'm on the clock.


1048
01:18:03.367 --> 01:18:06.928
Love is the leap
that won't be denied.


1049
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:10.472
I was going to say that. Good thinking.
I'll get her to dump the butcher.


1050
01:18:17.148 --> 01:18:20.083
I assume when you say "the butcher,"
you're speaking metaphorically.


1051
01:18:20.184 --> 01:18:26.657
No, I'm talking about
the old fart I work for.


1052
01:18:26.657 --> 01:18:29.455
<i>Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town</i>

1053
01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.360
<i>Gets full of corn</i>
<i>and starts bringin' 'em down</i>


1054
01:18:33.464 --> 01:18:36.092
<i>Just at the break of day</i>

1055
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.761
<i>You can hear old Hannah say</i>

1056
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:44.000
<i>Give me a pigfoot</i>
<i>and a bottle of beer</i>


1057
01:18:44.108 --> 01:18:47.737
<i>Send me, I don't care</i>

1058
01:18:47.878 --> 01:18:50.312
<i>I feel just like I wanna clown</i>

1059
01:18:50.414 --> 01:18:52.507
<i>Bring the piano player a drink</i>

1060
01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:54.345
<i>Because he's bringin'me down</i>

1061
01:18:54.452 --> 01:18:57.148
<i>He's got a rhythm</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>


1062
01:18:57.254 --> 01:18:59.279
<i>When he stomps his feet</i>

1063
01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:01.620
<i>He sends me right off to sleep</i>

1064
01:19:01.726 --> 01:19:03.751
<i>Check all your razors and...</i>

1065
01:20:00.384 --> 01:20:04.582
So, Leo,
what are you doing here?


1066
01:20:04.688 --> 01:20:07.748
I had to see you.

1067
01:20:07.858 --> 01:20:10.224
- I had to see you too.
- It's my wife.


1068
01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:13.125
- I know.
- She's looney tunes.


1069
01:20:15.399 --> 01:20:18.232
No, she's wonderful.

1070
01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:19.597
My wife?

1071
01:20:20.771 --> 01:20:23.467
- She's the one who got me singing.
- Marina?


1072
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:28.208
So, the thing is...

1073
01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:29.972
The thing is...

1074
01:20:35.452 --> 01:20:37.613
You're grade "A," Stella,
prime cut.


1075
01:20:37.721 --> 01:20:39.348
Together we're choice.

1076
01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:43.226
But my wife ain't got
nobody but me...


1077
01:20:43.327 --> 01:20:47.320
to see her through
her time of trouble.


1078
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:51.265
- We got to break it off, Leo.
- I can't just go abandoning her.


1079
01:20:54.872 --> 01:20:58.535
Are you women always one step ahead?
It's kind of spooky.


1080
01:21:01.045 --> 01:21:02.410
So...

1081
01:21:03.914 --> 01:21:05.848
do you want this back?

1082
01:21:27.037 --> 01:21:28.664
Damn.

1083
01:21:28.772 --> 01:21:31.935
I just want to tell you
I'm real sorry for accusing you.


1084
01:21:32.042 --> 01:21:35.534
I just don't know
what's the matter with me...


1085
01:21:35.679 --> 01:21:38.307
and I hope you can forgive me.

1086
01:21:41.685 --> 01:21:42.811
I can.

1087
01:21:45.522 --> 01:21:49.356
I really loved the flowers.
And the window.


1088
01:21:50.461 --> 01:21:52.156
Really.

1089
01:21:52.263 --> 01:21:54.163
There was an art lady
who came to the store today...


1090
01:21:54.265 --> 01:21:56.199
and she really loved it too.

1091
01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.758
She said you should call her...

1092
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:01.804
and I think you should too...

1093
01:22:01.906 --> 01:22:04.841
'cause you've really got
something special.


1094
01:22:04.942 --> 01:22:06.705
No, I don't.

1095
01:22:06.844 --> 01:22:09.312
No, a true gift.
I mean it.


1096
01:22:16.887 --> 01:22:21.324
He's such a good man,
too, Doctor.


1097
01:22:21.425 --> 01:22:25.191
But I guess you were right,
as usual.


1098
01:22:25.296 --> 01:22:29.528
If only his wife wasn't
such a great lady.


1099
01:22:29.633 --> 01:22:33.364
But the thing is,
I know he loves me.


1100
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:35.597
And I love him.

1101
01:22:35.706 --> 01:22:38.106
Such sweet sorrow.

1102
01:22:38.208 --> 01:22:40.699
God, love hurts!

1103
01:22:40.844 --> 01:22:44.974
Wait a second. You mean to tell me
that Leo broke it off?


1104
01:22:45.115 --> 01:22:48.050
Maybe they're really not
meant for each other.


1105
01:22:48.152 --> 01:22:49.744
Who?

1106
01:22:49.853 --> 01:22:51.377
Leo and Marina.

1107
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:57.650
I never told you
her name was Marina.


1108
01:22:58.662 --> 01:22:59.924
Of course you did.

1109
01:23:01.565 --> 01:23:03.726
No, I don't think so.

1110
01:23:03.834 --> 01:23:06.029
Sorry, then. My mistake.

1111
01:23:06.136 --> 01:23:09.264
No. That's her name.
I just...


1112
01:23:10.341 --> 01:23:12.241
don't remember telling you that.

1113
01:23:12.343 --> 01:23:15.278
You two really love
each other, right?


1114
01:23:15.379 --> 01:23:18.439
- Who?
- You and Leo, for God's sake.


1115
01:23:18.582 --> 01:23:23.485
- Gee, I think so.
- Yes or no? Stella, commit.


1116
01:23:23.587 --> 01:23:25.248
- Yes!
- Fine!


1117
01:23:25.356 --> 01:23:28.917
There. Now, if he's
the right man for you...


1118
01:23:29.026 --> 01:23:31.995
you can't let him slip by, can you?

1119
01:23:32.096 --> 01:23:34.064
Do you mind if I...
Can I?


1120
01:23:37.901 --> 01:23:39.232
But...

1121
01:23:39.336 --> 01:23:41.099
he's married.

1122
01:23:41.205 --> 01:23:44.902
What about my addiction to failure
in the form of married men?


1123
01:23:47.411 --> 01:23:51.006
Your addiction to failure stems
from your failure to commit.


1124
01:23:51.148 --> 01:23:53.480
And your failure to commit
stems from, of course...


1125
01:23:53.584 --> 01:23:55.074
your lack of trust.

1126
01:23:55.219 --> 01:23:56.743
I'm a little confused.

1127
01:23:59.623 --> 01:24:03.616
You listen to me, Stella.
I am your psychiatrist.


1128
01:24:04.862 --> 01:24:08.263
You have got to commit
to this affair once and for all...


1129
01:24:08.365 --> 01:24:10.094
or you are doomed to fail.

1130
01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.068
And if you fail at this affair...

1131
01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:16.071
you're gonna end up...

1132
01:24:16.173 --> 01:24:19.472
a lonely, old spinster.

1133
01:24:53.644 --> 01:24:55.509
It's me, Stella.

1134
01:24:55.612 --> 01:24:57.375
I have to talk to you.

1135
01:25:21.338 --> 01:25:23.238
Hurry. Hurry.

1136
01:25:51.835 --> 01:25:54.633
Listen, Leo,
I'm no home-wrecker.


1137
01:25:56.507 --> 01:26:00.136
Well, actually, that's not true,
but I don't want to wreck your home.


1138
01:26:00.277 --> 01:26:02.745
I like your wife too much.

1139
01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.848
But I love you.

1140
01:26:09.453 --> 01:26:11.785
Anyway, the thing is...

1141
01:26:11.889 --> 01:26:16.326
Dr. Tremor thinks that maybe
we have a future together.


1142
01:26:16.426 --> 01:26:17.620
Who?

1143
01:26:18.729 --> 01:26:21.391
Dr. Tremor, my therapist.

1144
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:30.641
Does it bother you
that I'm in therapy?


1145
01:26:30.641 --> 01:26:32.268
Okay! All right!

1146
01:26:32.376 --> 01:26:36.938
Why, why, why are you
fucking with my life?


1147
01:26:37.047 --> 01:26:38.708
I never laid a hand on her.

1148
01:26:38.815 --> 01:26:40.680
My life, my life!

1149
01:26:43.554 --> 01:26:46.250
First you start...

1150
01:26:46.356 --> 01:26:49.655
by telling my wife
to get me a girlfriend.


1151
01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.728
Then you tell my girlfriend...

1152
01:26:51.828 --> 01:26:54.058
that we should have
an affair.


1153
01:26:54.164 --> 01:26:56.894
Meanwhile my wife finds out
about my girlfriend...


1154
01:26:57.034 --> 01:26:58.763
only it's no go for her...

1155
01:26:58.902 --> 01:27:01.530
because she didn't handpick her!

1156
01:27:01.638 --> 01:27:05.005
And now she's giving me looks
with the meat cleaver!


1157
01:27:05.108 --> 01:27:07.042
What did I ever do to you?

1158
01:27:07.144 --> 01:27:10.443
It's a very confusing world, Leo.
I'd be lying to tell you otherwise.


1159
01:27:10.547 --> 01:27:12.606
What's the problem?
Ten words or less.


1160
01:27:12.716 --> 01:27:16.675
Jesus Christ! I'm trying to hold on
to my marriage here.


1161
01:27:20.724 --> 01:27:23.352
Did it ever occur to you that your wife
might want you to leave her?


1162
01:27:24.962 --> 01:27:26.657
Did it ever occur to you
that your wife...


1163
01:27:26.763 --> 01:27:29.254
might have found someone else?

1164
01:27:32.302 --> 01:27:35.032
My wife ain't having an affair.

1165
01:27:36.873 --> 01:27:39.774
- You never know.
- I know. I know.


1166
01:27:39.876 --> 01:27:42.242
You know why?
'Cause if she was...


1167
01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:45.509
I'd cut off his balls
with a carving knife.


1168
01:28:11.608 --> 01:28:13.940
I apologize for the interruption.
Where were we?


1169
01:28:15.379 --> 01:28:18.280
What's on your mind, Doctor?
You can trust me.


1170
01:28:19.983 --> 01:28:24.283
I am having
a professional breakdown.


1171
01:28:31.028 --> 01:28:33.929
I have done something...

1172
01:28:34.031 --> 01:28:36.124
unforgivable.

1173
01:28:37.501 --> 01:28:41.835
Alex, you've got to stop
thinking of yourself...


1174
01:28:41.938 --> 01:28:45.066
as responsible for
the fate of the world.


1175
01:28:45.175 --> 01:28:47.666
You're just a psychiatrist...

1176
01:28:47.778 --> 01:28:51.509
trying to muddle through
this twisted web of life.


1177
01:28:51.615 --> 01:28:54.914
You're obviously experiencing
a stress-induced anxiety...


1178
01:28:55.018 --> 01:28:56.849
You know her too, don't you?

1179
01:28:59.356 --> 01:29:00.983
Know who?

1180
01:29:02.793 --> 01:29:05.387
The butcher's wife!

1181
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:29.783
Okay, okay.
Goodness gracious.


1182
01:29:29.886 --> 01:29:32.753
I'm glad you're here.
I have so many things to tell you.


1183
01:29:32.856 --> 01:29:36.121
This has to stop now.
My practice is in chaos.


1184
01:29:36.226 --> 01:29:40.925
My patients are out of control because
you are a psychiatrist's nightmare.


1185
01:29:41.031 --> 01:29:42.999
No. You don't understand.
I figured it all out...


1186
01:29:43.133 --> 01:29:45.795
I take chaos
and turn it into order.


1187
01:29:45.936 --> 01:29:48.734
You take order
and turn it into a chaos...


1188
01:29:48.839 --> 01:29:50.534
that transcends chaos.

1189
01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.198
Why? I'll tell you why.

1190
01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:54.470
Because you are contagious.
That's why.


1191
01:29:54.578 --> 01:29:57.911
Everyone you touch
just goes berserk.


1192
01:29:58.014 --> 01:30:00.209
You're the only one
I see jumping around...


1193
01:30:00.317 --> 01:30:03.218
like a crazed jackrabbit.

1194
01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.220
Alex Tremor, you love me.

1195
01:30:05.322 --> 01:30:06.584
No! No, no, no!

1196
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:08.555
Stop fighting it so hard.

1197
01:30:08.658 --> 01:30:11.058
Stop fighting it.

1198
01:30:11.161 --> 01:30:15.598
We're meant. It's destiny.
Why are you being so stubborn?


1199
01:30:15.732 --> 01:30:17.666
I am just a doctor.

1200
01:30:17.801 --> 01:30:21.601
All I've wanted to do since I was
six years old is help people.


1201
01:30:21.705 --> 01:30:22.672
Me too.

1202
01:30:24.107 --> 01:30:26.302
- No. It's not the same.
- Oh, it is.


1203
01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:29.846
We both help people,
just in our different ways.


1204
01:30:29.946 --> 01:30:32.938
Just when it comes to our
true feelings and desires, we're just...


1205
01:30:33.049 --> 01:30:34.846
too close to see clearly.

1206
01:30:36.887 --> 01:30:39.117
Marina...

1207
01:30:39.222 --> 01:30:42.521
please, no more
fairy tales, all right?


1208
01:30:42.626 --> 01:30:44.526
Can't you see how dangerous you are?

1209
01:30:48.098 --> 01:30:50.794
You say that listening to your heart
and trusting what you feel...


1210
01:30:50.934 --> 01:30:53.494
is that what you're calling dangerous?

1211
01:30:53.637 --> 01:30:56.606
You know what?
I hope I am contagious...


1212
01:30:56.740 --> 01:31:00.301
'cause life isn't about
your damn books and theories.


1213
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:03.436
You know what? Life is life.
And it's messy...


1214
01:31:03.547 --> 01:31:06.072
and it's complicated
and it takes guts.


1215
01:31:06.183 --> 01:31:08.549
That's not something
you're gonna find in any book.


1216
01:31:08.652 --> 01:31:12.213
And just because you don't understand it
doesn't mean it's crazy.


1217
01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:22.596
No wonder everybody's
wandering around lost on this island.


1218
01:31:22.732 --> 01:31:24.632
They can't even smell the tides.

1219
01:31:24.734 --> 01:31:27.134
Here we go again...
the tides, the tides.


1220
01:31:27.237 --> 01:31:29.967
Can't you for once
deal with the problem at hand...


1221
01:31:30.073 --> 01:31:31.836
instead of hiding behind
all this hoodoo voodoo...


1222
01:31:31.942 --> 01:31:34.069
Yes, I can. You know what?

1223
01:31:34.177 --> 01:31:35.610
You get out now.

1224
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.574
Out of my way, asshole!

1225
01:32:10.247 --> 01:32:11.908
Just ignore him.

1226
01:32:22.526 --> 01:32:25.825
Honey, what are you doing?

1227
01:32:25.929 --> 01:32:27.658
I'm leaving.

1228
01:32:31.801 --> 01:32:35.396
- Where are you gonna go?
- Home.


1229
01:32:38.775 --> 01:32:41.471
I'm real sorry, Leo,
for all the mess.


1230
01:32:43.046 --> 01:32:45.708
I really thought we were
meant for each other.


1231
01:32:46.983 --> 01:32:48.712
Yeah.

1232
01:32:48.818 --> 01:32:50.683
Me too.

1233
01:32:52.923 --> 01:32:55.357
And you've been nothing
but sweet to me.


1234
01:32:58.328 --> 01:32:59.590
I just wanted...

1235
01:32:59.696 --> 01:33:02.722
so much to find somebody to love...

1236
01:33:04.167 --> 01:33:07.694
and be loved by that...

1237
01:33:07.837 --> 01:33:11.796
I guess I just jumped into that boat
so fast without thinking it through.


1238
01:33:15.445 --> 01:33:17.777
I wouldn't have had it
any other way.


1239
01:33:39.769 --> 01:33:43.068
Gracie, the sky is falling.

1240
01:33:43.173 --> 01:33:45.767
It's 2:00 in the morning, Alex.
Go home.


1241
01:33:45.875 --> 01:33:47.638
I know. I need to talk.

1242
01:33:47.744 --> 01:33:49.644
Yes, we do need to talk, Alex.

1243
01:33:49.746 --> 01:33:52.647
But you know what you need now?
You need sleep.


1244
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:57.982
Yeah. Can I stay here tonight?
I don't want to be alone.


1245
01:33:58.088 --> 01:34:00.886
It's not a convenient time
for me, Alex.


1246
01:34:00.991 --> 01:34:02.822
What? What?

1247
01:34:05.028 --> 01:34:06.791
I'm with somebody.

1248
01:34:12.636 --> 01:34:15.230
Gracie, that's...

1249
01:34:15.372 --> 01:34:16.703
that's great.

1250
01:34:16.806 --> 01:34:20.936
- You may not think it's so great.
- Is everything all right, Gracie?


1251
01:34:25.415 --> 01:34:27.747
You've got Robyn in there.

1252
01:34:27.851 --> 01:34:29.512
I know that.

1253
01:34:35.892 --> 01:34:37.689
My career is a shambles...

1254
01:34:37.794 --> 01:34:41.628
and my best friend is sleeping
with my girlfriend.


1255
01:34:43.566 --> 01:34:44.828
Ain't love grand?

1256
01:34:46.002 --> 01:34:47.637
That's not gonna cut it.

1257
01:34:48.972 --> 01:34:50.963
We're happy.

1258
01:34:51.074 --> 01:34:52.974
Don't take it apart.

1259
01:34:59.416 --> 01:35:01.077
So...

1260
01:35:07.724 --> 01:35:10.488
I was the one who got her
that nightgown.


1261
01:35:10.593 --> 01:35:12.584
- Call me tomorrow.
- Me too.


1262
01:35:24.908 --> 01:35:28.173
<i>Gone is the romance</i>

1263
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:32.247
<i>That was so divine</i>

1264
01:35:32.382 --> 01:35:34.441
<i>'Tis broken</i>

1265
01:35:34.584 --> 01:35:39.920
<i>And cannot be mended</i>

1266
01:35:41.257 --> 01:35:44.090
<i>You must go your way</i>

1267
01:35:44.194 --> 01:35:48.062
<i>And I must go mine</i>

1268
01:35:48.164 --> 01:35:51.759
<i>And now that our love dreams</i>

1269
01:35:52.702 --> 01:35:57.230
<i>Have ended</i>

1270
01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.467
<i>What'll I do</i>

1271
01:35:59.609 --> 01:36:02.009
<i>When you</i>

1272
01:36:02.145 --> 01:36:05.546
<i>Are far away</i>

1273
01:36:05.682 --> 01:36:09.914
<i>And I am blue</i>

1274
01:36:10.019 --> 01:36:12.214
<i>What'll I do</i>

1275
01:36:14.858 --> 01:36:16.758
<i>What'll I do</i>

1276
01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:23.060
<i>When I am wondering who</i>

1277
01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:27.034
<i>Is kissing you</i>

1278
01:36:27.137 --> 01:36:29.901
<i>What'll I do</i>

1279
01:36:32.475 --> 01:36:36.343
<i>What'll I do with just</i>

1280
01:36:36.446 --> 01:36:40.280
<i>A photograph</i>

1281
01:36:40.383 --> 01:36:47.448
<i>To tell my troubles to</i>

1282
01:36:49.159 --> 01:36:51.218
<i>When I'm alone</i>

1283
01:36:51.327 --> 01:36:57.232
<i>With only dreams of you</i>

1284
01:36:57.333 --> 01:37:01.667
<i>Dreams that won't come true</i>

1285
01:37:01.771 --> 01:37:04.296
<i>What'll I do</i>

1286
01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.651
<i>When I'm alone</i>

1287
01:37:25.762 --> 01:37:31.894
<i>With only dreams of you</i>

1288
01:37:32.001 --> 01:37:36.335
<i>Dreams that won't come true</i>

1289
01:37:36.439 --> 01:37:39.897
<i>What'll I do</i>

1290
01:37:40.043 --> 01:37:43.206
<i>What will</i>

1291
01:37:43.346 --> 01:37:47.806
<i>I do</i>

1292
01:38:29.893 --> 01:38:31.861
Grammy d'Arbo.

1293
01:38:31.961 --> 01:38:34.725
Yes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.


1294
01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:37.197
I always wanted her
to marry a doctor.


1295
01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:39.291
She's waiting on the lookout.

1296
01:38:42.272 --> 01:38:44.172
And I never read Plato.

1297
01:39:12.268 --> 01:39:16.227
Oh, it's a lonely world
without your split-apart.


1298
01:39:16.339 --> 01:39:17.966
I've always had a hard time
with mysteries...


1299
01:39:18.074 --> 01:39:20.542
and I've never been very good
with trust, but Marina...


1300
01:39:20.677 --> 01:39:23.168
I believe in you...

1301
01:39:23.313 --> 01:39:25.247
and I love you.
