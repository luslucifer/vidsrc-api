2
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340
Good morning, Mr Blake.
My name's Amanda.


3
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.590
I've got a couple of questions
here for you today


4
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.230
to establish your eligibility for
Employment Support Allowance.


5
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.590
It won't take up much of your time.

6
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.390
Could I just ask firstly,

7
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.100
can you walk more than 50 metres
unassisted by any other person?


8
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.950
- Yes.
- Okay.


9
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.110
Can you raise either arm as if to
put something in your top pocket?


10
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.110
I've filled this in already
on your 52-page form.


11
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.670
Yeah, I can see that you have

12
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.150
but, unfortunately, I couldn't
make out what you had said there.


13
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.630
Yes.

14
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.140
Can you raise either arm
to the top of your head


15
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.150
as if you are putting on a hat?

16
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.530
I've telt you, there's nowt wrong
with me arms and legs.


17
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.570
Could you just answer
the question, please.


18
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.970
Well, you've got me
medical records.


19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.550
Can we just talk about me heart?

20
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.590
D'you think you could
just answer these questions?


21
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.150
Okay.

22
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.550
So was that a yes, that you
can put a hat on your head?


23
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.390
- Yes.
- Okay, that's great.


24
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.070
Can you press a button
such as a telephone keypad?


25
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.850
There's nowt wrong
with me fingers either.


26
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.310
I mean, we're getting farther
and farther away from me heart.


27
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.230
If we could just keep
to these questions, thank you.


28
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.510
Do you have any significant difficulty

29
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.200
conveying a simple message to strangers?

30
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.190
Yes. Yes, it's me fucking heart.
I'm trying to tell you but you'll not listen.


31
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.990
Mr Blake, if you continue
to speak to us like that


32
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.910
that's not gonna be very helpful
for your assessment.


33
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.500
If you could just answer
the question, please.


34
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.310
- Yes.
- Okay.


35
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.190
Do you ever experience any loss of control
leading to extensive evacuation of the bowel?


36
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.190
No. But I cannot guarantee

37
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.360
there won't be a first if we divvent
get to the point.


38
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.230
Can you complete a simple
task of setting an alarm clock?


39
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.510
Oh, Jesus. Yes.

40
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.430
Can I ask you a question?
Are you medically qualified?


41
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.990
I'm a health care professional

42
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.500
appointed by the
Department of Work and Pensions


43
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.230
to carry out assessments for
Employment and Support Allowance.


44
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.430
But there was a bloke out in the,
er, in the waiting room,


45
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.790
he says that you work
for an American company.


46
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.430
Our company's been
appointed by the Government.


47
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.670
Are you a nurse?
Are you a doctor?


48
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.550
I'm a health care professional.

49
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.110
Listen, I've had a major heart attack.

50
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.070
I nearly fell off the scaffolding.

51
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.870
I wanna get back to work, too.

52
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.980
Now, please, can we talk about me heart?

53
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.710
Forget about me arse, that works a dream.

54
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.630
Piper, you lazy bastard.

55
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.790
Will you get out of bed
and do some housework!


56
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.060
China!

57
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320
China!

58
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.310
Sorry, Dan, just got a text
to go to work. I'm late.


59
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.430
Did you enjoy your
chicken tikka masala?


60
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.610
- How did you know that?
- Cos I can bloody smell it.


61
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.370
How many times have I told you about
leaving rubbish lying about the place,


62
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.460
stinking it up?

63
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.230
- Can I dump it later? I'm running late.
- No. Now!


64
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.150
Dan...

65
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.590
Erm, I've got a big favour to ask

66
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.620
I'm expecting a package. 
Really important.

67
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.730
They've changed my hours,
so I won't be in.

68
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.360
Can you keep an
eye out for the postman?

69
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.550
If you swear nae more rubbish.

70
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.670
- Catch!
- Don't you fucking dare.


71
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.350
- I'll kick your arse into next week.
- Okay.


72
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.350
Daft as a bloody brush.

73
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.510
When can I go back to work?

74
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.790
Ah, not yet, that's for certain.

75
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.390
You're making progress.

76
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.950
I think if we just
continue you on the same dosage.


77
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.390
And, yeah, rehab exercise.

78
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.390
We'll see if we can
the pumping capacity to increase.


79
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.790
- Yeah.
- And it might.


80
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.790
But if not, we might need to look
at fitting you with a defibrillator.


81
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.190
Keep up with the exercise, keep moving.
That's gonna build you up.


82
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.030
But you need to be rested as well.

83
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.150
Well, I'm a bit of
a night owl, you know.

84
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.390
I got into the habit
when I was looking after the missus


85
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.790
before she passed away.

86
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.110
How you doing, son? 
How you doing?

87
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.190
- All right.
- How's the old ticker?


88
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.950
Ah, you know, me marathon days are over.

89
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.190
But, you know,
I'll be fine in a month or two.


90
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.310
Ah, well, be leaving that Viagra alone.

91
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.420
I'll keep it for you, shall I?

92
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.900
Aye, I probably need it more than you.

93
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.870
Right, well, owt you want here?

94
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.110
- Have a look
- Oh, that's nice, aye.


95
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.430
Meranti, aye, African Meranti.
It's great, man.


96
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.440
So, er, d'you reckon
you'll get back to Ferguson's?


97
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.450
Depends on the work, I suppose.

98
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.550
I mean, you know what it's like.
It's up and down.


99
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.710
Aye, well.

100
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.110
Gotta see this.

101
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.030
There you go.

102
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.110
Oh, that's a lovely piece.

103
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.510
Aye, I'll have the...
I'll have the lads drop it by for you.


104
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.550
Erm, are you all right?

105
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.630
I'm on the mend.

106
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.270
I mean, I can get your shopping
sorted out for you, you know.


107
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.450
Like, the heavy stuff and that,
like, it's nae bother.


108
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.190
Thanks, Joe.
You know, I like to get out and about.


109
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.460
Gives us something to do.

shout if you need anything.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.910
I mean, I mean that.

112
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.470
You, you gave us
a big fright, you know.

Hey! I'll come and shite

138
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.110
Shut up.

139
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680
Hello?

142
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.110
Morning, mate.
Got a package for Mr Max Million.


143
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.870
- "Mr Max Million"?
- Yeah. Mr Max Million.


144
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.190
My address?

145
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.940
Yeah, definitely this address.

146
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.750
- Where's it from?
- China.


147
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.790
Oh. Give it here.

148
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.710
D'you know how long
I've been on this phone?


149
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.270
One hour, forty-eight minutes.

150
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.550
Jesus Christ, that's longer than
a football match. It'll cost a fortune.


151
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.320
I'm sorry, sir,
but it's been very busy.


152
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.700
There must be some mistake.

153
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.630
I've got a serious heart condition.

154
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.350
I'm in rehab and the doctor's
told us I cannae go back to work.


155
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.790
Now, I was getting the benefits
fine until that bloody assessment.


156
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.290
I see you've only
scored twelve points, er,


157
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.030
and you need 15 to obtain benefits.

158
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.230
Oh, points, that's your game?

159
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.170
I'm sorry, sir,
but according to our health, er,


160
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.750
health care professional,

161
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.190
you've been deemed fit for work.

162
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.150
So she knows better than my doctor,

163
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.940
a consultant surgeon and a physio team?

164
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.750
Well, I wanna appeal.

165
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.210
Well, that's fine,

166
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.640
but you'll have to first request
a mandatory reconsideration.


167
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.030
What the bloody hell does that mean?

168
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.810
It means the decision
maker will reconsider it


169
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.790
and if he comes to the same
decision, you can then appeal.


170
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.000
Right, well put us down for that, then.

171
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.130
Okay, sir, but you must wait

172
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.750
to get a call from the decision maker.

173
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.430
Why?

174
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.280
To tell you what the decision is.

175
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.630
But that's already been decided.

176
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.070
It is, but you're
supposed to get the call,

177
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.630
before the letter.

178
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.430
Well, is he gonna change his mind?

179
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.200
No, the call's
just to discuss the decision.


180
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.010
Well, I know what the decision is,
I've got the letter here in front of us.


181
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.790
D'you want us to read it to you?

182
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.010
But he should have called you first.

183
00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.310
But he didn't.

184
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.410
But he should have.

185
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.770
Well unless we've got a time machine,
we're pretty much knackered,


186
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.150
divvent you agree?

187
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.810
Er, he has to call you first, sir.

188
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.470
Listen,

189
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.790
can you not just put him on now,
so I don't have to waste any more time?


190
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.880
I can't do that, sir.

191
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.590
Where is he?

192
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.610
He'll give you a
call back when he, er,

193
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.790
- he gets the chance.
- When?


194
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.110
I don't know, sir.

195
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.220
This is ridiculous, man.

196
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.580
On the one hand, 
Jobseeker's Allowance,

197
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.590
only for those able and ready to work.

198
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.190
But if you're ill, you have to apply
for Employment and Support,


199
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.320
get an assessment carried out.

200
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.550
Well, I've done that
but they've knocked us back.


201
00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.690
Right, well if you've
been deemed fit for work,


202
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.830
your only option is Jobseeker's Allowance.

203
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.040
Or proceed with the appeal on
Employment and Support.


204
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.350
Well, can you give me a form for...

205
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.920
You know, erm, 
Jobseeker's Allowance

206
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.420
and then an appeal form
Employment and Support?


207
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.950
You have to apply online, sir.

208
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.150
I cannot do that.

209
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.720
Well that's how it is, sir.
Or you can phone the helpline.


210
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.870
Listen, you know,
you give me a plot of land,


211
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.190
I can build you a house.

212
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.870
But I've never been
anywhere near a computer.


213
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.870
D'you know what, we're digital by default.

214
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.150
Oh, here we gan.

215
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.870
I hear this all the time on the phone,
"I'm digital by default."


216
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.710
Well I'm pencil by default.

217
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.590
Look, I mean, what happens
if you just cannae do it?


218
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.070
There's a special number
if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.


219
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.750
Right, well can you give us that?
Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.


220
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.910
You'll find it online, sir.
I must ask you to leave now,


221
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.590
if you've got no appointment.

222
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.360
Right, can I help you?

223
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.630
Yeah, I'm here to see about
changing my work coach.


224
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.070
Thomas Armstrong, please.

225
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.910
Hang on a minute, 
Thomas, hang on.

226
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.420
Erm, would you like to take a seat?

227
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.990
Oh, I just need a minute. I just felt...
I'm just feeling dizzy, you know.


228
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.910
- Come and sit down.
- Oh, cheers, thanks.


229
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.430
Could you move up, please, love?

230
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.190
Thanks, pet, thank you.

231
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.710
- All right. I'll just get you a glass of water.
- Thank you.


232
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.820
Oh, thank you, pet.
Thank you.


233
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.750
Are you all right?
You look a bit pale.


234
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.950
It's just so bloody confusing,
all the jargon.


235
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.560
I mean, there must be some mistake.
I'm just ganning round and round in circles.


236
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.410
I've, I've really gotta
get this sorted out.


237
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.930
Oh I can understand that,
but you were late.


238
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.630
Thomas. You sit here
and drink your water, pet.


239
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.950
Thank you.

240
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.450
So now you're gonna sanction me so, er...

241
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.940
- No, I'm not gonna sanction you.
- I may not get any money for a month.


242
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.530
I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker
and they'll make the decision


243
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.530
- on whether they're gonna sanction you.
- That's ridiculous...


244
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.650
I'm not actually making the decision,
they're gonna do that.


245
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.750
And then if they do decide
to sanction you,


246
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.990
then you will take a 40%
cut in your benefits.


247
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.130
I know what it is,
I don't need you to explain it to me.


248
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.970
- I'm more than aware...
- Well there isn't anything else


249
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.980
anybody can do today.

250
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.570
So what I'm gonna have to do is,
look, I think I'm...


251
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.370
I've decided to...
Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?


252
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.530
I have to, I
have to follow the rules.

253
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.130
And the thing is if you're gonna,
be aggressive with me


254
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.810
- then I'm gonna have to ask you...
- It's not about me being aggressive.


255
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.690
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I'm trying to explain to you a situation


256
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.750
and you don't care.

257
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.810
- Er, security. Security?
- I don't know why people like you do this job.


258
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.980
I'm referring you
to the decision maker.


259
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.910
It's all the same thing.
I don't wanna hear your language


260
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.890
- I, I beg your pardon.
- Listen, I, I'm sorry, love,


261
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.650
- but you're gonna have to leave.
- Yeah, all right, frankly,


262
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.250
take your hands off me.
I'm gonna speak to the manager,


263
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.890
- I don't wanna speak to you.
- The fact is I'm just trying to explain...


264
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.050
- Sorry?
- I'm just explaining...


265
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.250
Well it's not you I wanna speak to...

266
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.090
- You can go back up there.
- Right, come and talk to me then


267
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.890
- if you've got something to say.
- Okay. Sorry.


268
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.030
All right.

269
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.650
I've tried to explain to the woman,
I've never been to Newcastle before.


270
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.030
We've just moved up here from London.

271
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.450
I've been here a few days,
I don't know where I'm going. Okay?


272
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.030
I was on the bus,
it's gone the wrong way.

273
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.600
We've run, got off the bus,
run so that I wasn't any more late.


274
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.310
She just don't wanna know

275
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.570
and now she's telling me
she's gonna refer me for a sanction.


276
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.270
What I want you to
do is listen to me. Okay?


277
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.950
The lady's told you what's right.

278
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.500
There's rules here,
rules that we have to stick to. Okay?


279
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.090
- It isn't against you, but you have a duty.
- Oh, mate, listen,


280
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.950
- I'm not saying it's against me.
- You have a duty to be here on time.


281
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.020
And I'm explaining to you

282
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.510
why I wasn't here on time.

283
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.990
- D'you know what? I understand, right...
- I got lost.


284
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.310
But what I gather now
is the decision maker...


285
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.010
The decision maker's gonna be
sending you a letter through the post.


286
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.020
So you're gonna have to wait for that.

287
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.130
- And then nobody...
- Yeah, I've got... My kids


288
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.850
have gotta start school tomorrow.
I've got about 12 quid in my purse.


289
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.050
- D'you know what?
- All because you can't just calm down


290
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.060
- and listen to people when they talk.
- Right.


291
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.210
- You have to do this.
- Right, d'you know what,


292
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.410
- I've listened to you. You've created a scene.
- With your rules.


293
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.610
- I think you need to...
- I've created a scene?


294
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.850
- You need to leave the building.
- If I was gonna create a scene,


295
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.970
you'd know about it, trust me.

296
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.060
I'm sorry, love,
but you are gonna have to go.


297
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080
This is ridiculous.

298
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.650
- Jesus Christ!
- What am I supposed to do?


299
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.250
- Who's first in this queue?
- I am.


300
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.790
D'you mind if this young
lass signs on first?


301
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.870
- No, no, you carry on.
- There you go.


302
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.630
Now you can go back to your
desk and let her sign on


303
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.990
and do the job that the
taxpayer pays you for.


304
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.590
- This is a bloody disgrace.
- Listen, all right,


305
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.070
this doesn't have to involve you.

306
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.350
Everybody's trying to do their job here
and you're creating more of a scene again.


307
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.770
But, look, you're not listening to her.

308
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.360
She's out of the area.
She's just been a few minutes...


309
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.040
Can you not let her sign on?
She's got two kids with her, man.


310
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.090
- What's wrong with you people?
- Right, listen, this isn't your concern.


311
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.570
I want you to get
out as well. All right?

312
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.900
I need you to leave.
We need to do this right. Yeah.


313
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.570
- All right.
- Listen, listen, listen...


314
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.170
- They're just gonna call the police.
- Phone the police.


315
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.790
Can we get some perspective in here?

316
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.770
You need to go or we're gonna
phone the police. All right?


317
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.990
Come on. Thanks very much...

318
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.770
Can we have a bit of perspective,
please, here, man?


319
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.250
- Away, don't be silly.
- Shouldn't even have this job.


320
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.610
- Come on. Please.
- Shouldn't even have this job.


321
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.330
- Come on, get out.
- All she needs is help, man.


322
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.000
- Let's get going.
- Just let her sign on.


323
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.350
Let's get going, all right.

324
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.780
Please.

325
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.090
I don't know what's wrong
with you lot, I really don't.


326
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.990
I need you to
keep going for me, okay?

327
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.360
- You want me to take one of them bags?
- No, it's all right, I'm fine, pet. I'm fine.


328
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.150
- Where's Dylan?
- I don't know.


329
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.710
Dylan! Come on!

330
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.930
- Honestly. Honestly.
- He's a handful, isn't he?


331
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.410
I can't sit down for five minutes
without him getting in trouble, can I?


332
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.550
Right.

333
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.840
- Good, good choice.
- She loves spaghetti.


334
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.490
Hey, you cannae go wrong
with spaghetti on toast.


335
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.760
Spaghetti, spaghetti on toast, isn't it?

336
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.060
Where's your brother gone?

337
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.910
- Dylan!
- Dylan!


338
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.630
Come on.

339
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.710
This, this is what he does.
He runs, he runs off.


340
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.280
- He's a handful, in't he?
- Come on!


341
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.830
Where ye been, on an adventure?

342
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.070
Dylan, not on the fences.

343
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.970
- It's just here.
- Mum, look, she's back, she's back.


344
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.350
She's back.

345
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.190
Tell you what, if it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna make this place a home.


346
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.200
You don't know how to
fix a cistern, do you?


347
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.870
It's driving me insane.

348
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.680
- Yeah, I'll have a look at that.
- Yeah?


349
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.190
I can fix owt, me, pet,

350
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.190
apart from computers.

351
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.800
- Straight up. You show him...
- I'll show him.


352
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.220
Dylan, can you stop it? Get in.

353
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.910
Hello, Mum. How are you doing?

354
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.110
Yeah.

355
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.430
Yeah, all right. All right. Yeah.

356
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.220
It's nice, it's nice.
There's plenty of space.


357
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.250
And, erm, yeah, it looks like they've put...
There's a nice bit of fresh carpet down.


358
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.950
The, the walls are all
nicely painted and that.


359
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.830
No, I know, Mum. Well, look, once...
Once you're feeling better and we're settled,


360
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.160
then you'll have to come up. You can come
up with Auntie May and stay, can't you?


361
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.640
Yeah, they're nice, yeah, friendly.
Friendlier than London.


362
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.430
Yeah.

363
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.640
D'you wanna have a word with Daisy?

364
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.550
All right, hold on. Talk to Nana.

365
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.190
Hello, Nan.

366
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.510
- Hello, Daisy. How are you?
- Good.


367
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.270
- Yeah? D'you like it?
- Yeah.


368
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.470
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, very.


369
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.510
I miss you, too. Bye.

370
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.270
Bye-bye.

371
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280
Hello, Mum.

372
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.390
All right. That's all right.
All right, I'll speak... Yeah, I've gotta go


373
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.150
but I'll speak, 
I'll call you tomorrow.

374
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.050
- All right.
- All right, love you.


375
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.670
- Love you, too. Bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.


376
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.640
So what are you doing up here, Katie?

377
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.770
It started when we got
kicked out of the flat.


378
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.070
We got in a bit of trouble.

379
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.300
It was ridiculous.

380
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.960
In Dylan's room there was a leak
coming through the wall,


381
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.120
coming through the top of the ceiling
down the wall.


382
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.930
And it was making him really sick.
Weren't it, Dais?


383
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.530
- Remember when Dylan weren't well?
- Yeah.


384
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.670
We had to run all
the way to the hospital.

385
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.310
Yeah, he was in and out the hospital.

386
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.290
I was talking to the landlord about it,
spoke to him.


387
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.310
And cos I complained, kicked us out.

388
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.600
What, they can just do that?

389
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.320
- Just throw you out?
- Yeah, yeah.


390
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.110
So we got out of there.

391
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.990
We was in a homeless hostel
for about two years, waiting on a flat.


392
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.990
Yeah. But it was close to their school
which they loved, so...


393
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.990
We just had to stick it out.
But we was in one room,


394
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.300
the three of us were in one room.

395
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.480
Like eating, sleeping, all the rest of it
and Dylan was just climbing the walls.


396
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.220
Honestly,
like boxed in like that, so, yeah.


397
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.870
They eventually offered me a flat,
so the good news was it was a flat.


398
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.630
Bad news was it was up here.

399
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.170
And they couldn't give you
anywhere near your family?


400
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.340
No, not in London.

401
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.350
They're, they're moving out the likes of me.
It's just too expensive for 'em.


402
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.340
So how's the kids taking it?

403
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.350
They're brokenhearted about leaving school.

404
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.950
Especially Daisy. 
She's furious with me.

405
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.430
Having to leave her friends and her nan.

406
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.040
I mean there was nothing I could do about it.
I couldn't have Dylan boxed in like that.


407
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.080
- Ah, she'll make friends soon enough.
- That's what I've told her.


408
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.750
And I've got a plan.

409
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.810
We got a little garden now and they've
each got a room of their own.


410
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.560
I'm gonna get a part-time job
and then I'm gonna go back to me books.


411
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.420
- Oh, you at college?
- Open University.


412
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.390
Yeah, I mucked up a little bit at school
so it's like a second chance.


413
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.050
But that all fell apart a little bit when
we was at the hostel,


414
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.230
but I'm not gonna give up.

415
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.030
Can't, can I?

416
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.630
Good on you, lass.

417
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.310
It's bloody freezing in here.

418
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.070
Oh, it must be a short.

419
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.990
Right, where's your fuse box?

420
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.710
There's nothing on the metre.

421
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.870
The kids are starting school and
I wanted to get 'em some nice new clothes.


422
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.960
And I thought I was gonna
get me money tomorrow.


423
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.630
Right.

424
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.590
I'll bring me tools round
and I'll sort this place out for you.


425
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.990
- Will ya?
- Yeah, course I will.


426
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.870
Shouldn't take long.

427
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.430
Right, thank you.

428
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.750
"Max Million", to my fucking address?

429
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.390
- China, what's in this box?
- Dan, it's not what you think it is.


430
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.870
Don't jump to conclusions.

431
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.510
Shift that bloody rubbish
and shift your arse.


432
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.350
I wanna see what's in this box.

433
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.140
Oh my God. Wow.

434
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.660
- What d'you think of these?
- Bloody trainers?


435
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.430
- Trainers.
- Trainers.


436
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.510
- These are only the best, Dan.
- Very best.


437
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.190
Aren't they, Piper?

438
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.460
Aren't they?

439
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.910
Stop it, man, I've got brittle bones.

440
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.950
Anyways, I've got a test for you, Dan.

441
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.710
- Go on, open it.
- Open that.


442
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.310
What's the difference?

443
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.480
Yeah. What's the difference
between them two?


444
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.700
They look the same.

445
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.710
- Bang on, brother.
- Exactly.


446
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.710
The difference is, they'd have cost me

447
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.750
And I'm gonna sell those for 80 quid.

448
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.550
Cheap counterfeits
to my fucking address?


449
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.630
I could have the Chinese Mafia
or the bloody Customs at me door.


450
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.750
The brass neck of
the bloody pair of you.

451
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.750
Dan, these are not counterfeits.

452
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.150
They're from the same factory as these.

453
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.590
Exactly the same quality.
Continuation of the same run.


454
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.540
- D'you not believe us?
- It's fucking genius.


455
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.670
How d'you manage this?

456
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.510
Well I know a guy from Guangzhou, don't I,
who works in the factory.


457
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.150
Yeah, works in the factory.

458
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.510
He's football mad.

459
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.270
He knows everything
about the teams, the players, everything.


460
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.190
So we do the deals by e-mails.
I send him the money by PayPal,


461
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.470
then he sends me the package by post.

462
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.630
Me, you mean.

463
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.270
Honestly, Dan, I did mean to say,
like I get them sent to different mates.


464
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.590
You know, small packages
like not to attract too much attention.


465
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.230
They usually get through.

466
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.640
I'll be able to tell all me mates
I knew both of you


467
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.310
before you were arrested.

468
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.910
See these trainers, Dan,

469
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.430
these are the future.

470
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.030
No more crap jobs.

471
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.390
No more shit from that warehouse.

472
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.360
D'you know what the bastards
did this morning?


473
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.630
Got us in at 5:30.

474
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.340
Unloaded one truck.
Guess how long that took?


475
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.200
Forty-five minutes.
And you know how much I got paid?


476
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.630
Three pound and seventy-nine pence.

477
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.830
Waste of my fucking time.
It's worse than China.


478
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.630
I'm gonna make it big
one day, Dan. I'm serious.


479
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.990
Hi there, can I help you?
You look a bit lost.


480
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.150
Aye. I have to apply
for Jobseeker's Allowance...


481
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.660
- Right, yeah. Mmm-hmm.
- And I wanna use one of them


482
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.140
to get on to that Internet web thing.

483
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.590
Right, you could do that today.

484
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.660
We're a bit busy at the moment.

485
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.760
If you can come back a bit later,
would that be okay?


486
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.820
- And then contact Job Centre Plus.
- Mmm-hmm.


487
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.990
And, here we are. "Claim Jobseeker's".

488
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.010
- Okay? So double-click on that one.
- Okay. All right.


489
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.230
And then we need to scroll
right the way down here to continue.


490
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.790
And that's your,
that's your form there for you.


491
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.750
So you need to run
the mouse up the screen,

492
00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.670
click into there and pop your postcode in.

493
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.990
- Run the mouse up the screen, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.


494
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.760
- No. No, not quite like that.
- No?


495
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.750
- What you need to do is get your cursor...
- "Your cursor"?


496
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.350
It's a fucking apt name for it.

497
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.350
So when you're moving your mouse,

498
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.730
- you see what I'm doing with my hand?
- Aye, right.


499
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.270
- Look at my hand.
- Aye. Oh, right, it moves like that.


500
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.750
- And then continue.
- Right, okay.


501
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.790
- And then you start from there. Okay?
- Okay.


502
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.070
- I'll leave you with it. Okay?
- Right.


503
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.150
Right.

504
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.830
Excuse me, pet.
You couldn't help us with this, could you?


505
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.790
Yeah. What is it?

506
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.750
I'm just filling this in.
I'm just... I cannot get the...


507
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.710
This keeps darting all over the place.

508
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.750
What do I do?
Do I get on to that and...


509
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.610
Do you just...
I mean, how do you get this down?


510
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.150
Right, so you're controlling this,
and you click on this bar.


511
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.790
- Right.
- And then you pull it down.


512
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.120
- Oh, right.
- And then you get...


513
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.810
- What, do I hold that on there, do I? Okay.
- The rest of it. Yeah.


514
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.010
- All right, then I can just...
- On the left side.


515
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.810
What, what, so I hold this
and just pull that down?


516
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.480
- Yeah, and click the left.
- And click...


517
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.830
- Click to the left.
- Yeah. Right.


518
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.950
And I just put that in there?
Oh, that's right, thanks very much.


519
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.630
- It's fine.
- Aye.


520
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.070
You're a star. Right.

521
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.390
Right, have I done it right?
There we are...


522
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.830
Oh, bloody hell. 
What's this now?

523
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.820
"Error"?

524
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.830
Well, what have I...

525
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.650
Here, mate, you divvent know
what I've done here, do you?


526
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.790
- This error thing.
- Yeah, that's a big thing.


527
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.870
Do you? I don't know, I was just
filling in the thing and it just went...


528
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.850
- There we go.
- Oh, oh, yeah, there we go.


529
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.910
We're back on, right.

530
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.370
- You're sorted, yeah?
- Hey, can you just hang on


531
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.270
just for two seconds so I divvent
go back here again. I'll...


532
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.850
Just, just, just, I'll just like do
a couple more questions.


533
00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.640
Yeah, I'll just stand over here,
don't worry.


534
00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.390
Er...
"Are you a Br..."


535
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.630
- Yeah.
- "Yes". Right. I do that.


536
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.910
- Right. What?
- Yeah.


537
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.330
- What's...
- Then you should continue.


538
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.630
Should be all right.

539
00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.870
Right, okay.

540
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.870
What's...

541
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.590
It's, it's, it's not bloody, it's not...

542
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.450
- Well nowt's happening now.
- Yeah, just give it a second.


543
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.830
Just give it a second.

544
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.320
But it's just not mov... I mean, look,
it's not even, it's not even moving.


545
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.350
- Let me try, right.
- What? Here, get that.


546
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.910
This is driving me mental, this.
I mean, what have I done now?


547
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.550
- It's frozen. Yeah.
- It's frozen?


548
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.510
Well... Well, can you defrost it?

549
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.140
No, mate, I can't.

550
00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.870
Think your time's up.

551
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.150
- What?
- Your time's up.


552
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.590
- Me time's up?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, mate.


553
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.900
Oh, sorry, mate, yeah.

554
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.110
- I'll just leave you to it.
- Oh jeez.


555
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.190
- Do you have a partner?
- Er, no. She, er, she's passed away.


556
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.590
- Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.


557
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.070
D'you have any dependent children
aged under 20 living with you?


558
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.230
No, I don't.

559
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.430
It's really important we get this filled in
because we need to get the process started.


560
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.990
Yeah.

561
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.030
Excuse me, Ann. 
Can I have a word, please?

562
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.610
Could you just give me 30 seconds, please?
We're just getting...


563
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.610
Well, actually,
can I have a word now, in my office?


564
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.670
Thank you.

565
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.830
- Right.
- Jesus, I've got you into trouble now.


566
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.710
- I'm really sorry.
- It's me that should be sorry.


567
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.590
You just carry on, you're doing good.

568
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.230
You know, Ann, we've spoke
about this before.


569
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.630
That isn't acceptable.

570
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.130
- I think in this case it's quite reasonable...
- Come on in the office.


571
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.990
The thing is you're setting a precedent.

572
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.270
It's not acceptable.

573
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.790
Oh, bugger. Bugger, it's...

574
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.180
Jesus...

575
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.590
I don't believe this.

576
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.210
No, I only want
my share of the football.

577
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.710
Right then, that's the only team you
need to know in the northeast, is Newcastle.


578
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.030
What other teams do you know?

579
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.030
- Er, Middle... Middle-borough.
- Middlesbrough, aye.


580
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.050
- Middlesbrough. Yeah.
- Middlesbrough.


581
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.150
You know, you divvent need to think
about them either. Aye?


582
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.070
There you go.

583
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.950
Er, we only have one Wagon Wheel left,
so I cut it into four.


584
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.070
But you can have two pieces
considering you're the host.


585
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.460
Oh, there you go.
I'll put your tea down there.


586
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.280
- Oh, hang on.
- Barclay's Premier League.


587
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.270
Here's the big question, Stan Li.

588
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.080
Did you say "Stan Li"?

589
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.230
Yeah. Stan Li from Guangzhou.

590
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.070
Are you two winding me up?

591
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.510
No, that's not our style.

592
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.470
Can you hear me, Stan Li?

593
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.190
Favourite player in the Premier?

594
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.550
Charlie Adams, Stoke City.

595
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.630
Get the fuck out of here.

596
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.070
Are, are you taking the piss?

597
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.030
EPL is crazy money, man.

598
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.310
Charlie Adam. Four million.

599
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.870
No ego.

600
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.150
Team player.

601
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.150
Tough guy.

602
00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.670
You see his goal against Chelsea
from his own half?


603
00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.670
Boom!

604
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.510
The ball flies up, over Courtois' head.
Cross the line, line. Goal!


605
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.740
He's not in China.
He's in the bloody takeaway down the road.


606
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.870
You two, you're taking the piss.

607
00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.110
Okay, Stan Li,
I'll e-mail you my best price. Top price.


608
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.110
I'm gonna see how I get on selling
these ones I've got, okay?


609
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.590
So I'll let you know.

610
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.110
Best price, no bullshit.

611
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.950
Remember, Charlie Charlie, all good money.

612
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.150
Okay, no best price, no more trainer.

613
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.710
No more business.

614
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.270
No more talkie-talkie. No more...

615
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.870
# Swing low, sweet chariot

616
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.750
# Coming for to carry me home #

617
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.990
Right, Dan.
Check your National Insurance Number.


618
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.550
Yep, that's okay.

619
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.550
Press that button right there, Bill Gates.

620
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.710
- What, this one here?
- That one there, "Send."


621
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.190
Huh. It's taken me bloody days
to get this sorted out.


622
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.510
Well done, son.

623
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.030
Jobseeker's Application done.

624
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.150
Dan, don't know why you're applying
for that after your heart attack.


625
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.830
Right, now I'm printing your appeal form
for Employment and Support Allowance.


626
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.590
But you can't appeal till they carry out
a mandatory reconsideration.


627
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.630
Is that printing out now?

628
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.750
You mean, they could have
given it to me just like that?


629
00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.470
Dan, they'll fuck you around,
I'm warning you.


630
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.670
Make it as miserable as possible.

631
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.950
No accident. That's the plan.

632
00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.950
I know dozens who have just given up.

633
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.670
Well they've picked the wrong one
if they think I'm gonna give up.


634
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.230
I'm like a dog
with a bone, me, son.

635
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.230
I have a note on the screen, sir,

636
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.280
that you're awaiting a call
from the decision maker.


637
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.870
Jesus, 55 minutes
to hear all this again.


638
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.350
Am I in a time warp?

639
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.210
You can't proceed to the appeal

640
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.110
or the mandatory reconsideration

641
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.270
till you have the call
from the decision maker.


642
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.670
Well, can you ask him to phone us
now, because I've got no income.


643
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.270
I've got no pension
and I've still got the bedroom tax.


644
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.960
I'll make a note on my screen, sir.

645
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.690
Well can you not give
him the note now?


646
00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.270
You know, put it in his hand?

647
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.520
This is a call centre, sir.

648
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.950
Hey, Dylan. D'you want a shot
at the screwdriver?


649
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.310
What kills more people,
coconuts or sharks?


650
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.190
He likes bouncing that ball, doesn't he?

651
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.300
Pardon?

652
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.990
That ball.
He likes bouncing it, doesn't he?


653
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.310
Well, it started in the hostel
where we had only one small room.


654
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.270
Why d'you think he does that?

655
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.150
I think he's missing his friends.

656
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.350
But he also does it when he's angry.

657
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.670
People never listen to him,
so why should he listen to them?


658
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.390
There you go. And we don't need
any glue, nothing like that.


659
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.190
Now you give me a hand
and we'll stick this up.


660
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.110
Right, you go that end
and I'll go this end.


661
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.390
And we'll stick this up here.

662
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.510
Yeah? Just pass it up here.

663
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.190
Aye, right. You do the bottom edge.
That's it.


664
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.910
The sun heats up all
the air in these bubbles...


665
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.390
And it'll keep your room nice and warm.

666
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.070
Can you go into my tool bag there,

667
00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.390
there's a piece of cloth.

668
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.390
Can you open it?

669
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.620
Eh?

670
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.520
- What do you think of that?
- It's gorgeous.


671
00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.710
Well it's a little present for
your new room.


672
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.430
- Now...
- Thank you.


673
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.350
- Where shall we put it?
- Up there, maybe.


674
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.230
Okay, hang on.

675
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.830
I'll get a hook and hang it there.

676
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.870
Yeah, what do you think?

677
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.650
It's great.

678
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.430
It'll look like you're under the sea.

679
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.630
And the sun will shine on them.

680
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.110
I think there will be fine, yeah?

681
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.430
I'll light these candles.

682
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.660
- Whoa.
- Yeah.


683
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.430
- Now hang on.
- That one's big.


684
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.030
It is. Now there's four candles. Right?

685
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.530
Mind you don't burn yourself.

686
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.070
I won't burn meself,
don't worry about that.


687
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.070
But thank you for thinking about us, Daisy.

688
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.390
Put that in there like that.

689
00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.110
And I put this one in here.
Now there's four candles in there, right.


690
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.870
And they last for four hours.

691
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.830
I'll put this small pot over. Right?

692
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.270
Block the hole off up there.

693
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.470
And then I put this
big pot over the top.

694
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.470
Now it takes a little while
but it'll take the chill off the room.


695
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.430
And if you just put your hand
over there now, you'll feel it, Daisy.


696
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.400
If you just put your hand over there,
you'll feel it starting to warm up.


697
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.950
- Huh, can you feel it? Yeah?
- A little bit.


698
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.670
- What about you?
- Yeah, a little bit.


699
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.630
Were you a soldier, Dan?

700
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.310
Was I a soldier?

701
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.820
Oh, more dangerous than that.
I was a carpenter.


702
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.610
Right, grub's ready.

703
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.130
- Yay!
- Go round that way then, Dylan.


704
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.150
Good boy. There's yours, poppet.

705
00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.540
Right, put Sweet on there.

706
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.750
Sit down nicely then.

707
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.090
- And, Dan, this one's yours.
- Oh, no, not for me, thanks, no.


708
00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.510
That's yours. All right?

709
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.150
Here you are. All right?

710
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.480
- Well, where's yours?
- I had mine earlier.


711
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.920
I'm just gonna have a bit of fruit.

712
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.590
You said that yesterday,
and the day before.


713
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.270
All right, eat up then.

714
00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.390
Looks delicious but, you know,
it's a wee... It's a wee bit early for me.


715
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.950
Please, Dan. It's the least I can do.

716
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.310
- Thank you, Katie.
- All right.


717
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.350
What was that sound, Mum?

718
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.160
Oh, babe, one of the tiles just fell off
the wall in the bathroom


719
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.430
where I was cleaning it.

720
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.590
It's the middle of the night.

721
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.930
- I know.
- You should really get to bed.


722
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.210
Okay. I'm gonna go to bed.

723
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.270
I'm gonna go to bed.

724
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.130
I just wanted to
get all the cleaning done in there


725
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.640
so you can have a nice bath tomorrow.

726
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.590
You like a bath, don't ya?

727
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.030
Yeah?

728
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.740
So you're gonna go up
and get into bed and wrap up nicely.


729
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.630
Okay, good girl.
Give me a kiss.


730
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.670
Go and get into bed.

731
00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.730
- All right? Good girl.
- Promise me you'll get to bed.


732
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.630
I promise you I'm gonna go to bed.

733
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.760
- Good night.
- 'Night, baby.


734
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.550
Daniel Blake?

735
00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.590
If you'd like to follow me, Mr Blake.

736
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.830
If you'd like to just take a seat.

737
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.830
This is the Claimant Commitment form.

738
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.710
You must commit yourself to spending

739
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.190
Now that can be newspapers, agencies,

740
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.710
and online via the Universal Job Match.

741
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.750
You just fill in the details.

742
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.990
But you must prove that
you've done this as well, mind.


743
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.070
Well I've been told by my doctor that I'm
not supposed to go back to work yet.


744
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.310
Then you should apply
for Employment and Support Allowance.


745
00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.750
I have, but I've been knocked
back by some quack


746
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.550
and now I'm trying to appeal.

747
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.710
Okay. Well that's your choice, Mr Blake.

748
00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.990
No, it's not my choice.

749
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.310
I've got no other form of income.

750
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.870
Do you want to sign this or not?

751
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.110
You just need to put your
signature here. I shall date it later on.


752
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.310
Thank you.

753
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.030
Now can I have
a look at your CV?

754
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800
"CV"?

755
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.390
You still don't get
this, do you, Mr Blake?

756
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.740
This is an agreement between
you and the State.


757
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.780
No, you still don't get it.

758
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.790
- No, you must...
- I'm desperate to go back to work.


759
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.910
- If you're desperate to get back to work...
- Unless the doctor tells us...


760
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.990
You need to have an up-to-date CV,

761
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.350
in order to help you look for work.

762
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.230
Now, just hold it right there.

763
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.750
There's a CV workshop
that I would like you to attend


764
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.790
and it's this Saturday at 9:00.

765
00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.390
No, thanks, I'll sort
that out on me own.

766
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.270
No, Mr Blake.
This is a formal direction.


767
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.820
You will attend if you want to proceed
with your Jobseeker's Allowance claim.


768
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.750
What happens if I don't?

769
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.830
Then you will be referred for a sanction.

770
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.860
Ten seconds.

771
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.470
Ten short seconds.

772
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.070
That's how much a typical employer
spends flipping through a CV.


773
00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.510
Fact.

774
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.270
Sixty applications for
every low-skilled job.


775
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400
Fact.

776
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.870
For a skilled job, it's twenty to one.

777
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.070
Fact.

778
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.910
Costa Coffee advertised eight jobs.

779
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.390
D'you know how many applications
they got from that?


780
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.910
Over 1,300.

781
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.540
Fact.

782
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.910
So, what does that mean?

783
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.680
We should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee.


784
00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.850
Yeah, d'you wanna share that with us?

785
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.290
I said, we should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee then.


786
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.050
This is serious business

787
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.460
and people have only got
one shot at this, all right?


788
00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.830
Well if you can count, it's obvious.
There's not enough jobs. Fact.


789
00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.800
Yeah, well, you'll be at
the back of the queue, won't you?


790
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.030
For those of us in the real world,

791
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.430
what that means is...

792
00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.550
"You must stand

793
00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.350
"out from the crowd."

794
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.070
Get noticed. Get smart.

795
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.790
It's not enough these days just to, er,

796
00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.910
just to show you have the skills.

797
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.110
You have to prove

798
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.190
how keen you are.
How dedicated.


799
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.860
Okay...

800
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.140
What I'd like you to do now
is to, er, format your CVs.


801
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.070
And, remember, all of these
have to be typed up in a clear font


802
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.980
in hard copy.

803
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.830
And we're also gonna need
a digital version for online.


804
00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.950
And some companies,

805
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.310
they're demanding CV videos,
sent in by smartphone.


806
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.940
How about that?

807
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.110
Okay? Let's make a start.

808
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.990
Are you taking any blokes on, mate?

809
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.960
I'm a joiner, you know
I'm just looking for some work, you know.


810
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.830
Not at the minute. 
Er, all manned up.

811
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.590
Okay, can, can I give you my CV?
And then if you can get in touch...


812
00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.550
- Excuse me, mate.
- Yeah.


813
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.980
D'you know if anybody's
taking anybody on round here?


814
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.470
Er, no, we're not taking anyone on.

815
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.980
Er, I'll tell you what you could do.

816
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.040
If you try about three units
up on the left there,


817
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.130
they'll probably...
They, they might be havin' one.


818
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.830
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay? Cheers, mate.


819
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.120
- Your best bet is to see him.
- Is he the boss? Him?


820
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.120
He's, he's the supervisor.
That's the boss there.


821
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.030
Excuse me, mate. D'you know if
they're taking anybody on here?


822
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.030
Have you got any jobs ganning?

823
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.140
No, you haven't?

824
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.680
Hey, mate, I'm looking for some work.

825
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.010
- Is there anything ganning on around here?
- There's nowt here, mate. There's...


826
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.950
There might be something,
erm, a bit further up,


827
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.120
- if you try one of the other estates, but...
- Yeah?


828
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.030
...nothing doing on here.

829
00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.270
Help you, mate?

830
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.090
Aye, I was just looking
for some work, mate.


831
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.030
I was wondering if you had
anything ganning on?


832
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.710
I might have.

833
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.930
- Aye?
- Done this graft before?


834
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.830
- You got any experience?
- Oh, I've got 40 years of experience, mate.


835
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.840
I can turn me hand to owt.
Can I give you me CV?


836
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.550
Way-ay, course, 
I'll have a look at it.

837
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.310
There you go.

838
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.060
Cheers.

839
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.030
- Daniel?
- Aye, that's me.


840
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.630
I'm Harry, by the way.

841
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.490
Well, you've got plenty
of experience, like, I've gotta be honest,


842
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.110
I'm absolutely sick of young'uns.

843
00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.920
Half the time they divvent turn up.
When they do, they cannot be arsed.


844
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.990
Dylan, Dylan, come off the road, come on.

845
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.550
Come on.

846
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.950
Dylan, come on.
Catch up. Come on.


847
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.790
- Is this the, er, queue for the food bank?
- It is, aye.


848
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.100
D'you know how long we'll be waiting?

849
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.150
Oh, a canny long time, I reckon.
We've been here ages already.


850
00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.820
Okay, thanks. Cheers.

851
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.350
- Hello.
- Hello.


852
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.550
How nice to see you.

853
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.710
Have you brought your little dog today?

854
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.790
Thank you very much, thank you.

855
00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.180
Is it just food for yourself
and the two children, Katie? Thank you.


856
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.760
Would your children have
a drink of juice and a biscuit?


857
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.910
Would you like to go and see Agnes?

858
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.230
Agnes?
Could you do a juice and a biscuit, please?


859
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.150
- Jackie?
- Yeah.


860
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.040
Would you be able to
help Katie with her shopping today, please?


861
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.480
- There you are.
- Thank you.


862
00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.430
- Hiya, Katie.
- Thank you.


863
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.220
So, we've got one adult and two
children, yeah? Come with me.


864
00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.040
- We'll start with the vegetables, yeah?
- Okay.


865
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.590
Right.

866
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.670
I'll give you one side and
we'll share it, yeah?


867
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.610
- Couple of onions.
- Is there anything we can do for you, hun?


868
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.230
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- Are you sure?


869
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.400
- Aye, all right then.
- Toiletries, yeah?


870
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.990
Okay...

871
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.520
Have you just moved up here?
Your accent's not from here.


872
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.170
- You're not a Geordie girl.
- Yeah. Yeah, been up a little while.


873
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.260
Just come up from London.

874
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.230
Right. Nice accent.

875
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.230
Can you understand the Geordies?

876
00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.380
Almost.

877
00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.300
Right, over here.

878
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.780
I think we need another bag.
Have we got one?


879
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.710
Did you bus here?

880
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.910
- No? Well, sometimes.
- Well, sometimes.


881
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.830
She likes tea sometimes.

882
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.270
- Well, I'll just keep going in with stuff.
- Yeah.


883
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.090
And then you tell me
what you don't need, yeah?


884
00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.440
Have you got any sanitary towels?

885
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.610
- We don't have sanitary towels, no.
- No? All right, not to worry. It's all right.


886
00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.250
- Don't really donate things much like that.
- Yeah.


887
00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.710
It's a shame, they should.

888
00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.270
Right, right, if you open your bag. Rice?

889
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.110
- And a couple of toilet rolls?
- Mmm-hmm.


890
00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.270
Yeah?

891
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.230
We'll go to the food.
It's falling out me bag.


892
00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.830
- You can put...
- I've got this one. Right.


893
00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.030
Erm, tins in yours.
Put them in there.


894
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.430
Can you see anything else you want?

895
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.600
- There you go.
- Okay, thank you.


896
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.190
- Erm, there's pasta sauce over here.
- Mmm-hmm.


897
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.110
I'll get you some pasta sauce?

898
00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.430
The pasta sauce...

899
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.990
And there's, er, pasta here as well.
I'll get you a pasta.


900
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.310
Hey, pet, are you all right?
What are you doing? What are you doing?


901
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.190
Come and sit down. It's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.


902
00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.470
Come and sit down.
Come and sit down, it's all right.


903
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.310
Oh...

904
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:30.270
Okay, it's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.


905
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.760
It's all right. 
D'you want a drink?

906
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.350
- D'you want a drink?
- I'm really sorry...


907
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.450
- What's the matter?
- It's okay, don't worry.


908
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.760
- I'll get you a drink.
- Mum, what's going on?


909
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.710
It's okay. It's okay

910
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.470
I'm just really hungry.

911
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.350
- Okay, don't look at me.
- No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.


912
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.510
There's no harm done.

913
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.710
I can't cope, Dan.
I feel like I'm going under.


914
00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.750
Look, you'll get through this, darling.

915
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.560
- Thank you.
- You'll get through this.


916
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.590
Katie, listen to me.
This isn't your fault.


917
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.350
You've done amazing.

918
00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.950
Dumped up here, on
your own with two kids.

919
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.990
You've done nothing to be ashamed of.

920
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.030
Come on, you're okay.

921
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.510
Come on, wipe yourself.

922
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.590
Come on... You're okay.

923
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.350
- If my mum could see me...
- It's okay.


924
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.070
Look, these people are here to help you.

925
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.170
You know, you've done nothing
to be ashamed of.


926
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.110
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, you're all right.


927
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.010
- Can I get you anything else?
- I just felt really faint.


928
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.390
D'you need some paper
tissues or baby wipes?


929
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.390
- I'll get you some baby wipes.
- Thank you.


930
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.270
I felt really faint.

931
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.150
Katie, can I get you something to eat?
Would you like some soup or something?


932
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.510
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
If you could get her some water.


933
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.100
Sure, yeah, anything. Yeah.
You not want some food?


934
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.430
- Yeah, please, get...
- Even something sugary.


935
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.950
I'll get you a doughnut or something.

936
00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.300
Yeah, yeah?

937
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.440
There's no middlemen.
Straight from the factory.


938
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.110
Same quality as the shop.

939
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.410
- Same quality, exactly.
- Well, you're gonna have to do us a deal.


940
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.420
I couldn't pay 80 quid for this, though.

941
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.790
If you go to
the shop, they're 150 pounds.

942
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.850
- A hundred and fifty quid?
- I'm selling these for 80 pounds.


943
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.050
- Only 80 quid.
- See, they've still got the stickers on.


944
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.710
Why are they 80?

945
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.850
The reason they're 80 is because
there's no middlemen, nothing.


946
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.880
- No middlemen, whatsoever.
- You and Piper, the top new businessmen.


947
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.450
That's my driver, Dan.

948
00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.120
I'll give you a bloody driver.

949
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.610
So no-one's worn them before?

950
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.650
No-one's wore them. Nothing, look.
Check the quality yourself.


951
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.270
I'd probably wear them for the gym.

952
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.890
I couldn't say 80 quid, mate.
This is too expensive for 80 quid.


953
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.880
- They're 150 pound in the shop.
- A hundred and fifty pound, yeah.


954
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.670
- Oh, Dan. You all right, mate?
- Hello, Joe.


955
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.920
- Aye, I'm all right, mate, aye.
- How are you doing?


956
00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:57.470
Erm, listen, we're ganning, erm...
We're away down the pub the night.


957
00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.490
There's a load of us ganning.
There's a band on, you know.


958
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.470
We're gonna sink a few pints.
D'you fancy, fancy coming down?


959
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.310
Aye, I'd murder a pint, mate, but I daresn't.
I've been telt to lay off the sauce, you know.


960
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.510
- Oh, really?
- But, listen, tell the lads I'll come down


961
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.950
and pop into the sawmill, eh?

962
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.510
Oh, aye, aye, aye.

963
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.990
You know, if you fancy it anyway,
we're all going down.


964
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.510
So we might see you later, mate.

965
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.000
- Nice to see you, man.
- See you then. Ta-ta, see you.


966
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.960
Message for Daniel Blake.

967
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.510
Mr Blake, this is a call
from the DWP decision maker.


968
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.830
You should soon receive a letter

969
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.310
which states that you have been
deemed fit for work


970
00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.390
and not entitled to Employment
and Support Allowance.


971
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.750
If you need any further information,

972
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.550
it's available online.
Thank you.


973
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.590
Fuck's sake.

974
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.910
- Hello?
- Hi, is that Daniel?


975
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.390
Yes, it is. Hi.

976
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.090
Hi, Daniel, it's Harry Edwards here.

977
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.530
We spoke the other day
at the garden centre...


978
00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.370
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- ...when you came down and handed your CV.


979
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.570
- How are you doing, mate? Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, thanks, yeah.


980
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.970
Er, listen. I tell you what, mate,
I've been going through all the CVs


981
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.770
I've had handed over the
last couple of weeks.


982
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.430
And I really like the look of yours.

983
00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.400
Erm, you've got the experience
I'm looking for.


984
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.960
I was wondering if you could possibly, er,
pop by tomorrow and that for an interview?


985
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.270
Oh... I'm really sorry, er, Mr Edwards,

986
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.590
but, you know, er, my doctor's told
us I cannae come back to work yet.


987
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.280
So you're not actually
looking for work, then?


988
00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.470
Well, it's hard to explain, you know.

989
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.010
So, well, what's the point
of handing in your CV


990
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.590
if you're not looking for work?

991
00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.240
Well it's the only way
I can get me benefits, you know?


992
00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:01.230
"Benefits"? So you prefer to be on
benefits than do a day's graft?


993
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.120
You know, I thought you were
a genuine bloke.


994
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.210
You know, I've spent a lot of time
going through them all.


995
00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.000
I've... I was gonna put
some graft your way.


996
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.160
You've just wasted my time completely.
Why don't you just sod right off!


997
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.240
Listen, that's not...

998
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.630
- That's your change and your receipt.
- Thank you.


999
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.630
- Thank you very much. Have a good day.
- Bye.


1000
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.150
- Bye.
- Thank you, bye.


1001
00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.660
Excuse me, madam.
I think you've been shoplifting.


1002
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.000
Would you like to come with me to the
manager's office and we can sort it out?


1003
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.300
I haven't been shoplifting.

1004
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.810
Okay, you have, and I've seen you.
So if you'd like to come with me...


1005
00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.410
No, I've got a receipt.
I've got, I've just,


1006
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.050
- the lady there's just served me.
- Okay, and if everything on your receipt


1007
01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.530
is all you've got on you,
then there's no problem.


1008
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.650
If you'd just like to come this way
to the manager's office.


1009
01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.660
No, I'm not going to the manager's office.

1010
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.970
You just stood there and watched
her serve me, I've got a receipt.


1011
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.600
I can lock the
door and call the police.

1012
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.610
You're talking about locking the
door and calling the police.


1013
01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.250
Would you like to come with me
to the manager's office?


1014
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.160
No, because I've just, you've
just watched me...


1015
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.440
Okay, and we'll sort that out.

1016
01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.650
Okay, and if everything
on the receipt's in your bags,


1017
01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.410
- then there's no problem.
- You don't need to shout at me.


1018
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.920
Okay, if you'd like to come this way.

1019
01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.930
She's just, you've just stood
there and watched it...


1020
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.290
- Okay, then we'll sort it out.
- ...and serve me with, didn't you?


1021
01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.710
And she's given me a receipt.

1022
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.950
Just this way.

1023
01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.550
Ivan, I'll take it from here.

1024
01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.510
What's your name, love?

1025
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.590
- Katie.
- Katie?


1026
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.830
- Katie Morgan.
- Katie Morgan.


1027
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.390
I'm really sorry.

1028
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.180
I haven't done anything like this before.
I've paid for these.


1029
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.870
What are you gonna do?

1030
01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.350
Katie.

1031
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.590
It's between me and you...

1032
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.070
It's got nowt to do with the store.
All right?


1033
01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.070
They're paid for.

1034
01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.950
Get yoursel' away.

1035
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.950
Thank you.

1036
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.750
Hey, hang on a second.
Hey, hang on...


1037
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.190
I'm sorry about that, I am.

1038
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.110
Can I get a quiet word?

1039
01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.470
Look, if you're in trouble and you
need money, I can help, okay?


1040
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.560
Look, a nice girl like you,
I can definitely help.


1041
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.180
That's my number.
My name's Ivan, okay?


1042
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.230
Ring me any time, all right?

1043
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.630
Okay?

1044
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.950
Come and have a look at this.

1045
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.060
That is a miracle.

1046
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.880
He's been sat there for about 15 minutes.

1047
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.230
What's this, Dan?

1048
01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.830
It's a cassette.

1049
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.220
What's a cassette?

1050
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.320
Plays music. Come here, 
I'll show you.

1051
01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.910
All right.

1052
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.310
You pop that in there. Oh, no, you
gotta take it out the case first.


1053
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.510
It'll not play like that.

1054
01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.360
Right, you put that in
there like that. Yeah?


1055
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.030
And press that button there.

1056
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.630
Bit more. Harder.

1057
01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.180
That's it.

1058
01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.420
It was Molly's.

1059
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.110
She recorded it off the radio.

1060
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.880
Shipping forecast.

1061
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.870
It's on late at night.

1062
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.590
Sailing By.
D'you like that tune?


1063
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.870
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Molly loved it.


1064
01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.270
It's nice, isn't it?

1065
01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.550
So how'd the interview go?

1066
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.510
Oh, nothing's working out
with the school times at the minute.


1067
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.120
So I went to, erm, some of the agencies
and put my name down on the waiting list,


1068
01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.920
cos I could do cleaning in the morning.

1069
01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.910
Went to some hotels.
Went round all the cafes.


1070
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.670
Must have walked for bloody miles.

1071
01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.930
Well, I can pick the kids
up for you, you know.


1072
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.150
Till I start work again.

1073
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.300
Dan. The answer is "coconuts".

1074
01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.070
Correct.

1075
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.080
What's he talking about, "coconuts"?

1076
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.150
Ah, shall we tell your mum?

1077
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.550
- Go on.
- When I was bouncing my ball on the stairs.


1078
01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.930
- What stairs?
- The stairs in our house.


1079
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.830
- Yeah.
- Dan asked me a question.


1080
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.550
What, what question did he ask ya?

1081
01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.790
"What kills people more?

1082
01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.950
- "Coconuts or sharks?"
- Mmm-hmm.


1083
01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.310
And I said coconuts.

1084
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.560
And you got it right?

1085
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.200
- Is that right?
- Yeah, he's right.


1086
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.820
Is that Molly?

1087
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.510
Yeah. Yeah, that's Molly, yeah.

1088
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.990
Let's see that, Dais.

1089
01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.990
Show me that one.

1090
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.390
"Molly." Like the name.

1091
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.750
What was she like?

1092
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.030
She was special.

1093
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.790
Yeah, she was special, Daisy.

1094
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.630
Not easy.

1095
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.390
She was up one minute, down the next.

1096
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.030
Smart and funny. Huh.

1097
01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.030
Ah, that lass made me laugh.

1098
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.180
Kind.

1099
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.140
She had a big, big heart.

1100
01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040
But...

1101
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.470
She said her head
was like the ocean.


1102
01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.190
Dead still, then wild.

1103
01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.030
Never knew where she'd end up next.

1104
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.470
I mean, the music helped that.

1105
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.790
But then she'd hit the rocks.

1106
01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.470
"Where'll we sail to tonight, Dan?"

1107
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.510
That was our little joke.

1108
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.310
Her last words to me were,

1109
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.110
"I wanna sail away, Dan,
with the wind at me back.


1110
01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.220
"That's all I need, Dan."

1111
01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.180
Do you have any children?

1112
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.230
I'd have loved that, Daisy. No.

1113
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.430
- Do you miss her?
- Dais.


1114
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.190
It's okay.

1115
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.070
She was crazy.

1116
01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:55.870
Hard work.

1117
01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.350
But I loved her to bits.

1118
01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.750
I'm lost without her, really.

1119
01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.560
- There you go, pet.
- Oh, thank you.


1120
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.110
That must have been hard for you, Dan.

1121
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.320
I mean, did you look after her
right till the end?


1122
01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.110
Well, you know, I thought it'd be
a relief when she passed away.


1123
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:24.140
Cos it was difficult to go into work,
you know, when she was ill.


1124
01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.270
And after you've been looking after
somebody for so long...


1125
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.870
It seems to take
over your life, you know.

1126
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.240
- Yeah, and you forget your own.
- Huh.


1127
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.510
Well she was lucky to have you.

1128
01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.860
Daisy's dad, I thought was
something really special.


1129
01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.340
He turned out not to be.

1130
01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.110
Me mum tried to warn me about it,
but I was 18, so I didn't listen.


1131
01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.150
And then I did the same
thing with Dylan's dad.


1132
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.000
You're a young lass,
you got your whole life ahead of you.


1133
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.140
And when you get back
to those books, you'll be flying.


1134
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.270
Yeah, I can't look at 'em, Dan.
They really upset me.


1135
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.150
- You gotta keep a hold, you know.
- Mmm-hmm.


1136
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.390
You're doing your kids proud.

1137
01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.150
I mean, we all need the wind
at our back every now and then.


1138
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.830
- Don't we?
- Mmm. Yeah.


1139
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.230
Well that's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1140
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.590
And how do I know you've actually
been in contact with all these employers?


1141
01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.830
Well, I walked round the town.
I gave out me CV by hand.


1142
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.070
Well, prove it.

1143
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.860
- How?
- Well, did you get a receipt?


1144
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.590
Take a picture with your mobile?

1145
01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.200
With this?

1146
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.710
I give you my
word that's what I did.

1147
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.600
That's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1148
01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.110
What about the Universal Job Match online?

1149
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.190
I went to the library,
there's my appointment card.


1150
01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.510
Did my head in. 
And I tried my best.

1151
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.230
It's not good enough.

1152
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.910
Can I look at your CV?

1153
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.350
All right.

1154
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.230
Did you not learn anything
at the CV workshop?


1155
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.070
You'd be surprised.

1156
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.870
Not good enough, Sheila?

1157
01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.730
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refer you

1158
01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.230
to a decision maker for a possible
sanction for four weeks.


1159
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.550
Your payment will be frozen.

1160
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.790
You may be entitled
to Hardship Allowance if you apply.


1161
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.070
Do you understand?

1162
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.430
And if you are sanctioned, you must
continue to look for work and sign on.


1163
01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.470
If you don't, you may be sanctioned again.

1164
01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.270
And it's likely to be for thirteen weeks
on the second occasion, and thereafter.


1165
01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.870
And likely to be the maximum
of up to three years.


1166
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.270
Would you like me to write
you a referral to a food bank?


1167
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.030
Dan, you're not leaving, are you?

1168
01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.750
Aye, I'm off to the Bahamas.

1169
01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.310
Nah, I'm just sick of the old stuff.
I need a change.


1170
01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.700
Are you okay, Dan?

1171
01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.110
I'm fine, son.

1172
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.110
You don't look okay.

1173
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.750
No, really, I'm fine.

1174
01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.020
You haven't given us a row
about leaving the rubbish out.


1175
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.470
I'm okay, China, really.

1176
01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.710
If you need anything, 
Dan, let me know.

1177
01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.350
Absolutely anything.

1178
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.150
I mean it, Dan, anything.

1179
01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.910
I know, son.

1180
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.630
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a hundred.

1181
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.350
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, two hundred.

1182
01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.310
All right?

1183
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.270
Aye, fair enough.

1184
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.350
Anything else I can help you with?

1185
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.260
No, that's it.

1186
01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.910
What about these?

1187
01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.380
Good quality hand tools.

1188
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.390
Nae chance. I'll be ganning back
to work soon enough.


1189
01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.870
Well, the offer's there.

1190
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.390
Now these look nice.
How much d'you want?


1191
01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.390
They're not for sale, mate.

1192
01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.150
Give us a ring if you change
your mind. See you now.


1193
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.430
What are you doing?

1194
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.270
Oh, you're freezing.

1195
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.990
What's wrong?

1196
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.270
Well, erm, the girls at school
are making fun of me.


1197
01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.420
They're what?

1198
01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.790
The girls at school
are making fun of me.


1199
01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.430
Why are they making fun of you?

1200
01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.190
My shoes fell apart.

1201
01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.470
Oh, did they?

1202
01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.880
But we glued them back together.

1203
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.960
- Mmm.
- They fell apart again?


1204
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.200
All right, we can get you
a new pair of shoes.


1205
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.960
We don't have the money.

1206
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.320
Don't you worry about that,
we can get you a new pair of shoes.


1207
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.430
Okay.

1208
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.270
One of the girls heard about
what happened at the food bank.


1209
01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.360
And they're saying
things to you about that, are they?


1210
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.200
We'll get it sorted,
don't you worry.


1211
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.040
D'you wanna sleep here with me?

1212
01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.470
Yeah? All right, babe,
roll over then. Tuck in.


1213
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.790
That's it. Roll right over.
I'll tuck you in.


1214
01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.590
Good girl.

1215
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.630
Hello?

1216
01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.310
Hello, is that Ivan?

1217
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.510
It is, yeah. Who's that?

1218
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.510
It's, it's Katie,
the girl at the supermarket.


1219
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.550
You gave me... You gave me
your phone number.


1220
01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.750
Okay, I remember you.

1221
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.860
Yeah, I was, erm... I was ringing about
the work that you were talking about.


1222
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.990
It's nice to meet you.

1223
01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.590
You don't need to be nervous
with me. I can see you're in pain.


1224
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.360
You don't...
You don't need to be, all right?


1225
01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.590
I'm gonna help you. Okay?

1226
01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.510
So, don't cry, right.

1227
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.590
I don't want you to cry,
I'm gonna help you.


1228
01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.910
I know the situation. Ivan's told us a
little bit about you and, you know,


1229
01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.000
and that's what I'm here for.
I am gonna help you.


1230
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.640
Hey, ya.

1231
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.630
- All right?
- Yeah.


1232
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.720
Did they, er, they go down all right?

1233
01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.630
Nae bother. Both fast asleep. How'd it go?

1234
01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.830
Yeah, it was good, it was good.
It was a, it was a single-parent meeting.


1235
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.330
One of the mums came and spoke
to me afterwards, she was really nice.


1236
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.630
Ah, there's some good
people round, yeah.


1237
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640
Yeah.

1238
01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.610
Make sure you take care
of yourself, Dan, won't ya?


1239
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.960
- Course I will.
- All right.


1240
01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.630
- See you soon.
- Good night.


1241
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.630
- Give my love to the kids in the morning.
- I will do.


1242
01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.350
- Thank you.
- 'Night.


1243
01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.710
Dan, it's me. Erm, thank you
for coming round tonight.


1244
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.310
Daisy woke up and she forgot to ask
you about her school project.


1245
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.190
She's, erm, she's gotta interview
somebody about their work


1246
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.710
and she wants to speak to you.

1247
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.550
Oh, and they, they loved all your stories.

1248
01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.720
She said that Dylan was just
laughing and laughing.


1249
01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.830
It was lovely. Nearly made me cry
when she told me.


1250
01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.750
All right, I'll speak to you soon.
Sleep well. 'Night.


1251
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.070
I've come to see the girl.

1252
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.790
Okay. Come in.

1253
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.870
Erm, do I pay you?

1254
01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.800
No, you pay the girl. 
It's that door there.

1255
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.800
Right.

1256
01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.790
Oh, no, Dan.

1257
01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.190
Katie, you don't need to do this.

1258
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.550
You shouldn't see me like this.

1259
01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.190
I'm sorry.

1260
01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.040
No, this, this is cut off. This is separate.
Can you... You need to get out.


1261
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.880
Listen, I couldn't speak to you in the flat,
I need to speak to you now.


1262
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.900
Dan, please, get out.

1263
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.750
Oh, Katie, please,
I need to speak to you.


1264
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.830
I just wanna speak to you. Katie!

1265
01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.870
Dan, please, just go.

1266
01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.230
Dan, please, I don't want you here!
Will you just go, please!


1267
01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.870
- I've built you a bookcase.
- What?


1268
01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.140
For your books.

1269
01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.070
Oh, Dan. Please, just go.

1270
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.170
- Please, just go, I don't want you here.
- This is breaking my heart.


1271
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.230
Dan, please, just leave me alone.

1272
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.230
I've got 300 quid in my pocket.

1273
01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.270
I can buy the kids fresh fruit.

1274
01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.960
If you can't deal with it,
I can't see you any more.


1275
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.190
Listen, I've gotta go back inside.
D'you understand?


1276
01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.360
I don't wanna speak to you any more.

1277
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.390
And don't show me any more love.

1278
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.230
Cos you're gonna break me, Dan.

1279
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.510
I don't understand.

1280
01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.910
So what jobs have you actually applied for?

1281
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.310
It's a monumental farce, isn't it?

1282
01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.950
You sitting there with your
friendly name tag on your chest, Ann,


1283
01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.110
opposite a sick man looking
for nonexistent jobs,


1284
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.510
that I can't take anyway.

1285
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.070
Wasting my time,
employers' time, your time.


1286
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.750
And all it does is humiliate me,
grind me down.


1287
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.310
Or is that the point,
to get my name off those computers?


1288
01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.470
Well, I'm not doing it any more.

1289
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.140
I've had enough.

1290
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.910
I want my date for my appointment

1291
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.990
for my appeal for Employment and Support.

1292
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.310
- Have you not had that yet?
- No.


1293
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.350
Please listen to me, Dan.

1294
01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.950
It's a huge decision to come off JSA
without any other income coming in.


1295
01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.990
Look, it... It could be weeks before
your appeal comes through.


1296
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.630
You see, there's no time limit
for a mandatory reconsideration.


1297
01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.420
I've got a time limit.

1298
01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.030
And you might not win.

1299
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.950
Please, just keep signing on.

1300
01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.070
Get somebody to help you
with the online job searches.


1301
01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.110
Otherwise, you could lose everything.

1302
01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.110
Please don't do this.
I've seen it before.


1303
01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.830
Good people, honest people, on the street.

1304
01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.020
Thank you, Ann.

1305
01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.590
But when you lose your self-respect,
you're done for.


1306
01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.680
I'll be seeing you gentlemen later.

1307
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.830
Oh, wait until security sees this.

1308
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.310
What's going on here?
What are you fucking playing at?


1309
01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.480
- Aye-aye. You cannot touch us.
- Well that's clever, in't it?


1310
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.110
It's me new art installation.

1311
01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.140
Eh? Certainly can, lads. Come on.

1312
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.480
Look at this, you got all the technology.

1313
01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.670
- Look at this!
- I can't believe it.


1314
01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.910
I cannot believe it, man.
What have you done?


1315
01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.190
This is me new hobby.
Shall I put that on my CV?


1316
01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.100
Did you stop, even for a second,

1317
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.660
to think about the consequences
of what you've done here?


1318
01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.230
All I know, mate,
is if I divvent get my appeal date,


1319
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.190
I'll be here every day doing this.

1320
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.950
- Unbelievable. Every day?
- Every day.


1321
01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.270
Tell you what, Ben,
just phone the police. Okay.


1322
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.490
I cannae... Listen, mate,
I cannot believe this now.


1323
01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.970
This is out of our hands.
We're gonna have to phone the cops, man.


1324
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.130
Well, if youse had done your job
like you should have done,


1325
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.570
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.

1326
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.510
I cannot believe it. 
I cannot believe it.

1327
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.110
Go on, lad, give him a hand.

1328
01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.330
Yes!

1329
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.350
Words of wisdom!

1330
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.430
You're the man, wee man! Eh?

1331
01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.710
Fucking eh? Yeah!

1332
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.670
Are youse out of work, mate?

1333
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.430
Are you fucking...
Are you Daniel Blake?


1334
01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.590
I am Daniel Blake, yes.

1335
01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.310
Hey, this is Daniel Blake!

1336
01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.900
Fucking look at that. Yeah!

1337
01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.510
Yeah! Hey!

1338
01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.270
You look fucking freezing, pal.
Here, have my jacket.


1339
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.230
- No, no.
- No, come on, man, have my fucking jacket.


1340
01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.530
It's all right, son.
Look after yoursel', eh?


1341
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.870
Keep yoursel' warm like.

1342
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.220
You're a gentleman.

1343
01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.070
So what's, what's your appeal all about?

1344
01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.150
Liar!

1345
01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.720
You're... You're under arrest
on suspicion of criminal damage.


1346
01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.180
Hey, a miscarriage of justice, eh.

1347
01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.070
Slow down. Whoa. Back off.

1348
01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.260
All right, all right, all right.

1349
01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.990
What the fuck's going on? Eh?

1350
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.270
You should be arresting the wankers
who came up with sanctions. Eh?


1351
01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.420
That preachy baldy cunt.
What's his name?


1352
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.070
Ian Duncan fucking what's-his-face.

1353
01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.040
Aye, and the posh dicks in their mansions

1354
01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.250
who came up with the fucking
bedroom tax for disabled...


1355
01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:55.110
Listen, youse are all gonna
be out of a fucking job anyway.


1356
01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:58.270
Privatizing you, eh?
All the fucking Tories, man.


1357
01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.270
Aye, members
of the fucking big club, eh.


1358
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.990
Fucking posh Eton twats.

1359
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.300
Sir Daniel fucking Blake, pal!

1360
01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.470
Hey, should be a statue
made for you, pal.


1361
01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.310
Fucking Sir Daniel Blake!

1362
01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.710
Yer a fucking beauty!

1363
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.430
Yay!

1364
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.110
So, what happens now?

1365
01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.870
Right, this is a
copy of the caution sheet.

1366
01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.310
Because you fully admitted the offences

1367
01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.310
and you've been of good
character in the past,


1368
01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.310
we're cautioning you for the offence
of criminal damage,


1369
01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.870
under Section Five of the Public Order Act.

1370
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.230
But please remember
that these can come back


1371
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.270
and haunt you if you re-offend.

1372
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.470
So try to keep yourself out of trouble.

1373
01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.950
Aye.

1374
01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.680
- See him out, please.
- This way, Mr Blake.


1375
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.510
Dan. Dan!

1376
01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.750
Come, I need to talk to you.

1377
01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.950
We called you loads of times.

1378
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.110
Dan!

1379
01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.110
Mum's been so sad lately.

1380
01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.510
Why don't you speak to her?

1381
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.150
Don't you have credit on the phone?

1382
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.440
I see you.

1383
01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.430
We understand what happened to your heart.

1384
01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.150
Mum spoke to one of your neighbours.

1385
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.230
We didn't know about it.

1386
01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.230
It's cold out here.

1387
01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:02.480
I'm freezing.

1388
01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.470
Please, Daisy, 
I'm not feeling very well.

1389
01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.270
I made you some couscous.

1390
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.110
And Dylan sent you his lollipop.

1391
01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.470
He's really missing you, too.

1392
01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.470
Just go, Daisy, please.

1393
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.230
Can I ask you one question, Dan?

1394
01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.190
Did you help us?

1395
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.070
Suppose so.

1396
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.830
So why can't I help you?

1397
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.520
I'm sorry.

1398
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.510
I'm sorry, Daisy.

1399
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.300
I'm really sorry.

1400
01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.300
You know, I'm not usually a nervous person,
Katie, but I'm nervous about this.


1401
01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.030
It's only natural, Dan.

1402
01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.550
I just want it done, you know?

1403
01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.550
Yeah. Well, you're prepared.
You got all your papers.


1404
01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.550
You've got a good,
good person representing you.


1405
01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.710
And then when you're done,
you can come, come to dinner to celebrate.


1406
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.360
The kids are really looking
forward to seeing you.


1407
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.590
Hi, er, Daniel Blake. I've come for my
appeal for the reinstatement of my...


1408
01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:52.590
Employment and Support Allowance.

1409
01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.830
- Daniel, hi. Hello. Are you all right?
- Hello.


1410
01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.310
- Hi, I'm Katie. I'm a friend of Daniel's.
- Hi.


1411
01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.740
- You're here for support, yeah?
- Yeah.


1412
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:12.150
Daniel, your appeal will be heard by a
legally qualified chairperson and a doctor.


1413
01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.230
- Aye, fingers crossed.
- Yeah...


1414
01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.870
If I lose this appeal,
I'm out on the streets.


1415
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.950
Well, we've got some updated
reports here from your GP,


1416
01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.550
your own consultant and your
physiotherapist.


1417
01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:25.310
And they're all furious.

1418
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.830
You're gonna win this, Dan.

1419
01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.230
I do this every week.

1420
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.040
- I bet me life on it.
- I told ya.


1421
01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:40.590
Just be yourself,
answer the questions and relax.


1422
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.590
I'm really confident.

1423
01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.630
D'you have any questions?

1424
01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.040
Well, I've got one or two things
I'd like to get off me chest.


1425
01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.430
- But will they listen?
- It's the least they can do.


1426
01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.950
And can I go in with him?

1427
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.630
I'll certainly ask.
Would you like her to?


1428
01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.920
- Yeah. Definitely, yeah.
- Yeah?


1429
01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.390
Okay, I'll certainly ask.
No problem at all.


1430
01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.230
All right. Thank you.

1431
01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.150
My pleasure.
I'll just go and see what the score is.


1432
01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.630
- Yeah.
- Sounds good, don't it?


1433
01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.620
Look at them.

1434
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.070
It's funny, they've got
my life in their hands.


1435
01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.660
Thanks, Katie, for coming.

1436
01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.950
Thank you for asking me.

1437
01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.430
You stubborn old bastard.

1438
01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.590
I think I'll go
and freshen up, yeah?


1439
01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.830
All right.

1440
01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.750
Can somebody, er,
phone an ambulance, please? 9-9-9.


1441
01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.030
There's a guy collapsed in the toilet.
He's flat out.


1442
01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.830
Phone 9-9-9. Somebody, please.

1443
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.500
Dan!

1444
01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.470
No! Dan!

1445
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.750
Just had a heart attack.
Yeah, two breaths, please.


1446
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:45.950
Oh, Dan!

1447
01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.550
- Just the two breaths...
- Is he breathing?


1448
01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.590
Oh, Dan.

1449
01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.010
Listen, we're trying to help
him as much as we can.


1450
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.750
No, no, no, please keep going,
please keep going. Don't stop.


1451
01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.080
I'm afraid we've lost him.

1452
01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:01.750
No, don't say that,
please don't say that. No.


1453
01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.350
- No, please!
- I'm so sorry.


1454
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.510
I'm sorry.

1455
01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:09.270
- Please...
- Where's the ambulance now?


1456
01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.870
- Please.
- No response at all.


1457
01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.860
Please. Please try again.

1458
01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:12.990
Erm...

1459
01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:18.990
They call this a "pauper's funeral"
because it's the cheapest slot, at 9:00.


1460
01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:23.030
But Dan wasn't a pauper to us.

1461
01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.590
He gave us things that money can't buy.

1462
01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.870
When he died, I found this on him.

1463
01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.630
He always used to write in pencil.

1464
01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:40.670
Erm...

1465
01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.870
And he wanted to read it at his appeal
but he never got the chance to.


1466
01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:51.710
And I swear that this lovely man,

1467
01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.150
had so much more to give,

1468
01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.430
and that the State drove him
to an early grave.


1469
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.870
And this is what he wrote.

1470
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:12.470
"I am not a client, a customer,
nor a service user.


1471
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.900
"I am not a shirker, a scrounger,
a beggar, nor a thief.


1472
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.910
"I'm not a National Insurance Number
or blip on a screen.


1473
01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:29.310
"I paid my dues, never a penny short,
and proud to do so.


1474
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.860
"I don't tug the forelock, but look my
neighbour in the eye and help him if I can.


1475
01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.550
"I don't accept or seek charity.

1476
01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.550
"My name is Daniel Blake.
I am a man, not a dog.


1477
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.950
"As such, I demand my rights.

1478
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.550
"I demand you treat me with respect.

1479
01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.670
"I, Daniel Blake, am a citizen,

1480
01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.520
"nothing more and nothing less."

1481
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:04.860
Thank you.
