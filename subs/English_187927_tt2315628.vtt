1
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.003
AARON: I remember
when I was little.


2
00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:21.317
The mums and dads used to tell
all the little kids


3
00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:24.148
about the devil
in the ocean.


4
00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:30.016
How it had cursed
the town,


5
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.397
and all the people in it.

6
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:41.855
And everyone was scared,
and everyone was sad.


7
00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:49.276
And it looked like only
darkness would remain.


8
00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:53.315
And they knew only
if the devil was caught...


9
00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:58.009
would things go back
to how they were before.


10
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.299
CATHY: Sh. It's okay.

11
00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:15.958
Everything is gonna
be okay, I promise.


12
00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:23.414
MAN 1: We was always
brought up, respect the sea,


13
00:02:23.448 --> 00:02:25.588
'cause the sea's
the master.


14
00:02:25.623 --> 00:02:29.523
And you don't take chances.
Never take chances.


15
00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:35.081
MAN 2: The sea was very calm,
very quiet,


16
00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:37.462
very peaceful,
not a lot of wind.


17
00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:41.363
Something must have been
catastrophically wrong.


18
00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:47.714
MAN 3: If you're out there
and something's gonna happen,


19
00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:49.612
it's gonna happen.

20
00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:53.064
If it's gonna take you,
it'll take you.


21
00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.359
Put your head up.

22
00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:43.770
WOMAN:
Lifeboats and helicopters
were unable to recover


23
00:03:43.804 --> 00:03:46.014
anything
the following day,


24
00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:48.499
but still no sign
of those missing.


25
00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:52.261
PRIEST:
This week of celebrations


26
00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:55.092
is also a chance
for us to remember


27
00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:57.301
those that we have
lost this year.


28
00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.305
A chance for us
to remember the happiness


29
00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.410
and the love
that they gave us.


30
00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:08.105
And to realize that they
will always be with us,


31
00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.039
both now and forevermore.

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:09.338
"Do not stand
at my grave and weep.


40
00:05:11.202 --> 00:05:14.240
I am not there,
I do not sleep.


41
00:05:15.344 --> 00:05:18.554
I am a thousand
winds that blow.


42
00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.143
I am the diamond
glints on snow.


43
00:05:23.145 --> 00:05:26.355
I am the sun
on ripened grain.


44
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.394
I am the gentle
autumn's rain.


45
00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:34.191
When you awaken
in the morning's hush,


46
00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:37.608
I am the swift
uplifting rush


47
00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:40.749
Of quiet birds
in circled flight.


48
00:05:40.783 --> 00:05:43.614
I am the soft stars
that shine at night.


49
00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:50.276
Do not stand
at my grave and cry.


50
00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:57.283
I am not there;
I did not die."


51
00:06:04.842 --> 00:06:07.431
WOMAN 1: The whole thing's
a tragedy, really.


52
00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:10.503
Seeing Aaron go out to sea
with his older brother...


53
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.195
older brother
not coming back.


54
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.274
WOMAN 2: Six went out
and only one came home.


55
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:26.243
It's really
incredibly sad that


56
00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:30.454
so many young men were
lost in one disaster.


57
00:06:34.354 --> 00:06:36.598
WOMAN 3: He survived
and came back,


58
00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:39.670
but it's a shame that
the other boys didn't make it.


59
00:07:12.772 --> 00:07:15.844
You'll be glad to get
back to normal again, eh?


60
00:07:15.878 --> 00:07:17.432
Yeah.

61
00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:19.606
How's Aaron getting on?

62
00:07:20.883 --> 00:07:22.333
Yeah, he's all right.

63
00:07:22.368 --> 00:07:23.886
That's good.

64
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.649
But don't you go leaving
me on my own again, okay?


65
00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.722
It's harder to look busy
if you're not here.


66
00:07:31.756 --> 00:07:33.482
Okay, then.

67
00:08:12.003 --> 00:08:14.489
AARON: I still
see you around.


68
00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:16.525
In the darkness.

69
00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:19.735
In the beauty.

70
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:23.705
Together we fought
one hundred wars.


71
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:29.573
Together
we found the world.


72
00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.475
I just miss you,
you know.


73
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.411
We all just
really miss you.


74
00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:02.088
Turn

75
00:09:02.122 --> 00:09:04.953
It's not that.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.


76
00:09:04.987 --> 00:09:06.644
There you are.

77
00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:11.615
Think about this
carefully, now.
I want this as evidence.


78
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.619
We will be engaged in...

79
00:09:17.483 --> 00:09:21.556
In what?Less than 3 years' time.

80
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.730
Three years?Well...

81
00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:51.448
Were you not shitting it?

82
00:09:51.482 --> 00:09:55.106
I would've been
shitting it like
fucking right, man.


83
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.592
Course you would
have been.


84
00:09:57.626 --> 00:10:00.629
You shat yourself when big
Annie showed you her growler,
didn't you, man?


85
00:10:03.114 --> 00:10:05.462
We all thought
you'd moved away.


86
00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:08.534
No, just not been
around for a while.


87
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:13.435
Can you remember anything?

88
00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:16.680
No.

89
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.132
Can you not remember
anything at all?


90
00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:23.514
No, not really.

91
00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.418
Go. Go.

92
00:10:32.937 --> 00:10:36.044
There it goes, man.

93
00:10:36.078 --> 00:10:37.701
It's there.Where?

94
00:10:37.735 --> 00:10:39.185
It's gone up there.Where is it?

95
00:10:39.219 --> 00:10:41.429
There it is.

96
00:10:41.463 --> 00:10:43.914
Over there.Yeah, I see it.

97
00:10:43.948 --> 00:10:47.435
There it is.
It's still alive.


98
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.058
Sick.

99
00:10:50.092 --> 00:10:52.440
Oh, man.

100
00:10:55.477 --> 00:10:57.065
Fuck you!

101
00:10:57.099 --> 00:10:59.481
That was
on the head, man.


102
00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:04.452
Look, he's waving at you.Do it.

103
00:11:04.486 --> 00:11:06.212
Go on.

104
00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:08.456
You shat yourself.

105
00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:18.466
MAN 4: Everybody's just trying
to move forward


106
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.226
and get on with their lives,

107
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.507
but every time that you
see him, you just think back.


108
00:11:26.784 --> 00:11:28.752
There's been a bad
accident here,


109
00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:33.481
and Aaron's just a reminder
all the time.


110
00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:30.736
AARON: They say I need
to be strong.


111
00:13:32.772 --> 00:13:35.706
That we should
all move on.


112
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.053
Big boy here
starts his job tomorrow.


113
00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:40.021
I know what
you're thinking.


114
00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:42.575
You're looking at him going,
"Has he got a paper round?"


115
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.957
Well, no,
he's actually not.


116
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.201
He's going out on
the boats with me.


117
00:13:51.688 --> 00:13:56.865
AARON: They've all forgotten,
saying you're gone.


118
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.006
That you'll
never come back.


119
00:14:03.803 --> 00:14:06.599
But I know
you're not gone.


120
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:15.228
I know you're still alive.

121
00:14:27.309 --> 00:14:29.070
REPORTER: There has been
no trace of the boat


122
00:14:29.104 --> 00:14:31.003
since it set out
from the harbor--


123
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.039
MAN 5: You depend
on the survivor's explanation.


124
00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:34.972
What happened?

125
00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:36.871
If he could explain why did
he survive and they didn't?


126
00:14:36.905 --> 00:14:38.148
REPORTER: Search
and rescue teams


127
00:14:38.182 --> 00:14:39.908
found no sign
of the men...


128
00:14:39.943 --> 00:14:41.254
WOMAN 4: You
think to yourself,


129
00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:44.016
"There's two brothers
on that boat.


130
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.295
Maybe there should have been
an effort to save each other,


131
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:49.746
but yet only
one survived."


132
00:14:52.783 --> 00:14:54.440
MAN 6: When a boat goes down,

133
00:14:54.474 --> 00:14:56.960
the families will respect
the ones that's lost


134
00:14:56.994 --> 00:14:59.410
more than the one
that comes ashore.


135
00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:01.792
Always the way.

136
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.660
What about the dreams,
the bad dreams that
you were talking about?


137
00:15:09.282 --> 00:15:11.906
I don't really get
them so much anymore.


138
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.151
Aye, well, it's a process,
day by day.


139
00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:20.777
We're just trying to
figure out what would
be best for you just now.


140
00:15:23.193 --> 00:15:26.161
Do you not see why
we're worried about you?


141
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.304
There's nothing
wrong with me.


142
00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:41.798
MAN:
Hello, Coast Guard Rescue.
How can I help?


143
00:15:41.832 --> 00:15:43.282
AARON: I was just wondering

144
00:15:43.316 --> 00:15:47.079
if you've still got
boats going out looking...


145
00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.460
and-- and if you've
seen anything.


146
00:15:49.495 --> 00:15:53.879
Sorry. Do you know the people
on the boat at all?


147
00:15:55.984 --> 00:15:58.262
AARON: Yeah, no, I did.

148
00:15:59.505 --> 00:16:02.301
One of them
was my brother.


149
00:16:02.335 --> 00:16:05.822
The amount of time
that's passed, it's not...


150
00:16:05.856 --> 00:16:09.860
To be fair, it's not
looking too good, I'm afraid.


151
00:16:11.897 --> 00:16:15.348
How do you know
that they're dead?


152
00:16:15.383 --> 00:16:17.419
You're gonna have
to be realistic here,


153
00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:21.078
that it's very rare that
we'll ever see them again.


154
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.843
Davie.

155
00:17:02.844 --> 00:17:04.328
Davie.

156
00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:07.297
Can I have a word?

157
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.334
Yeah.

158
00:17:11.957 --> 00:17:14.062
He was a good lad,
all right?


159
00:17:18.066 --> 00:17:20.966
He said one of the boats
out there was yours.


160
00:17:21.863 --> 00:17:23.865
That's right, aye.

161
00:17:27.144 --> 00:17:30.458
I was wondering
if it would be all right,


162
00:17:30.492 --> 00:17:32.287
maybe next
time you go out,


163
00:17:32.322 --> 00:17:34.151
maybe I could
come with you.


164
00:17:36.084 --> 00:17:38.190
I wouldn't want
pay or anything.


165
00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.917
I just need to go out,
you know.


166
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:43.367
I cannot help you there,
I'm afraid.


167
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.994
Or do you know anyone
else that I can talk to?


168
00:17:49.028 --> 00:17:52.135
I cannot help you,
I'm afraid.


169
00:18:01.903 --> 00:18:05.873
Well, have you seen
anything out there?


170
00:18:07.184 --> 00:18:09.255
Like what?

171
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.257
Don't know.

172
00:18:12.914 --> 00:18:14.916
Just anything.

173
00:18:18.989 --> 00:18:22.096
You remember John, eh?

174
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.512
He was out in the boat
with you and your brother.


175
00:18:24.546 --> 00:18:27.308
You remember John, right?

176
00:18:27.342 --> 00:18:28.965
Yeah.

177
00:18:30.656 --> 00:18:35.488
Aye, well,
John was my son.


178
00:18:37.525 --> 00:18:41.391
I thought you'd come here
to talk to me about John,


179
00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:46.085
ask how me and his mother
were doing, but no.


180
00:18:48.432 --> 00:18:52.471
Funny thing, I remember
him saying to me


181
00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:56.889
he didn't think you were
right for the boats.


182
00:18:58.718 --> 00:19:02.205
Said having someone like
you out there was dangerous.


183
00:19:05.173 --> 00:19:07.969
Why do you think
he'd say that, eh?


184
00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:11.524
I don't know.Eh?

185
00:19:14.113 --> 00:19:16.944
I don't know.

186
00:19:18.497 --> 00:19:20.223
You don't know.

187
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.229
Well, maybe
you can tell me


188
00:19:26.263 --> 00:19:29.094
why I'll never
see my boy again.


189
00:19:31.959 --> 00:19:36.653
Why I'll never get a chance
to even put him in the ground.


190
00:19:36.687 --> 00:19:39.138
Yet here you are,
large as life,


191
00:19:39.173 --> 00:19:42.348
asking if you can
come onto my boat.


192
00:19:51.495 --> 00:19:54.982
You don't know you'll
never see him again.


193
00:19:57.087 --> 00:19:58.571
What did you say?

194
00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:04.094
What the fuck
did you say?MAN: Eh, easy!


195
00:20:07.235 --> 00:20:09.272
Keep him the fuck
away from me.


196
00:20:09.306 --> 00:20:11.584
I think you'd
better leave.


197
00:20:16.796 --> 00:20:19.523
AARON:
They say this is possible.


198
00:20:21.042 --> 00:20:23.286
This isn't possible.

199
00:20:25.046 --> 00:20:26.979
They don't know.

200
00:20:28.118 --> 00:20:30.120
Not for sure.

201
00:20:39.819 --> 00:20:42.270
I will find you.

202
00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:53.247
JANE:
Hello?


203
00:20:53.281 --> 00:20:55.525
AARON:
Hi, Jane. It's me.


204
00:20:59.287 --> 00:21:03.015
I was just wondering if you
wanted to meet up or anything.


205
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.411
Are you still
at the college?


206
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.447
No.

207
00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:29.352
Did you like it?

208
00:21:30.836 --> 00:21:33.045
It was all right.

209
00:21:37.394 --> 00:21:40.087
You still do
your dancing?


210
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:41.467
Just with the wee
ones, you know.


211
00:21:43.193 --> 00:21:45.437
They keep me busy enough.

212
00:21:56.758 --> 00:21:58.484
What?

213
00:22:00.107 --> 00:22:02.074
What is it?

214
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.322
You remember
when we were wee,


215
00:22:08.356 --> 00:22:10.462
you and Michael had
a pretend wedding here?


216
00:22:12.257 --> 00:22:14.707
You had a tablecloth
on your head.


217
00:22:17.296 --> 00:22:20.265
And Michael made
me the best man.


218
00:22:22.922 --> 00:22:25.511
I think he made
you the priest too.


219
00:22:34.348 --> 00:22:37.109
Do you ever feel
like he's still here?


220
00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:40.492
Like he might come back?

221
00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:47.188
All the time.

222
00:23:14.595 --> 00:23:16.459
Michael.

223
00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:22.741
Got you, Michael.

224
00:25:22.792 --> 00:25:25.450
Hey, Aaron.
What's happening?


225
00:25:26.554 --> 00:25:28.694
What the fuck
are you wearing, man?


226
00:25:28.729 --> 00:25:29.971
Try it on.

227
00:25:30.006 --> 00:25:32.422
Yeah, try it on,
go on, go on.


228
00:25:52.097 --> 00:25:53.754
Michael!

229
00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:03.867
Were you out last night?

230
00:26:06.974 --> 00:26:08.596
No.

231
00:26:09.873 --> 00:26:12.807
One of the girls at work
said she saw you.


232
00:26:14.395 --> 00:26:16.466
I wasn't.

233
00:26:27.028 --> 00:26:28.754
BOY: How he can walk about,

234
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:31.723
and people have seen him,
like nothing's happened.


235
00:26:31.757 --> 00:26:33.587
He shouldn't be here.

236
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:35.623
He shouldn't be back here.
Simple as that.


237
00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.536
AARON: She loved you more than
all the beauty in the world.


238
00:26:53.607 --> 00:26:56.506
She was born laughing
in an angel's bath.


239
00:27:00.648 --> 00:27:03.410
They say once, her father
hit her mum so hard,


240
00:27:03.444 --> 00:27:06.378
she didn't
talk for a year.


241
00:27:11.659 --> 00:27:14.559
She's the only one
who'll believe me.


242
00:27:16.526 --> 00:27:19.391
She's the only one
who can help.


243
00:27:27.606 --> 00:27:30.851
I was wondering if there
was maybe a job for Aaron,


244
00:27:30.885 --> 00:27:32.784
just for a wee while.

245
00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:34.924
I've enough of a job keeping you
lot on the now, you know that.


246
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.449
Well, can he not
just come in while I'm here,


247
00:27:42.483 --> 00:27:44.658
just to help out?

248
00:27:44.692 --> 00:27:47.419
I don't think it's the
right place for him now.


249
00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:54.184
Do you think
anyone will hear?


250
00:27:54.219 --> 00:27:56.428
Just do it.

251
00:27:59.604 --> 00:28:01.847
Come on. Hurry up.
Come on.


252
00:28:03.228 --> 00:28:05.610
Fuck.
It's really loud.


253
00:28:45.166 --> 00:28:48.515
AARON: Do you think...

254
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:51.276
if you believe
anything enough...


255
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.623
it'll come true?

256
00:28:55.314 --> 00:28:57.558
JANE: Of course.

257
00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:01.148
AARON: I think if you believe
anything enough,


258
00:29:01.182 --> 00:29:04.738
it will come true,
if you just believe.


259
00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:11.641
Would you wait on him?

260
00:29:13.332 --> 00:29:15.507
JANE: I'd wait forever.

261
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:20.132
AARON: Do you think we'll
ever see him again?


262
00:29:25.206 --> 00:29:27.001
JANE: I know we will.

263
00:29:56.237 --> 00:29:58.550
Michael!

264
00:30:13.116 --> 00:30:15.705
FRANK: I know you feel
sorry for him,


265
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.845
but it's not your
job to look after him.


266
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.713
I swear sometimes you're
too nice for your own good.


267
00:30:26.302 --> 00:30:31.756
But you need to start
looking after yourself,
okay?


268
00:30:34.137 --> 00:30:36.864
All right?

269
00:30:40.281 --> 00:30:42.007
All right.

270
00:30:57.367 --> 00:30:59.024
Michael.

271
00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:05.686
Michael!

272
00:31:13.314 --> 00:31:15.040
Michael!

273
00:31:17.422 --> 00:31:19.631
Michael.

274
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:24.912
Michael!

275
00:31:30.918 --> 00:31:32.195
Michael!

276
00:31:35.716 --> 00:31:37.649
Where are you?

277
00:31:42.171 --> 00:31:44.069
Michael!

278
00:32:08.749 --> 00:32:11.096
You're gonna be
all right, mate, okay?


279
00:32:16.377 --> 00:32:18.138
You hear me?

280
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.004
I'm just needing
to go out.


281
00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:28.493
Is he all right?

282
00:32:28.527 --> 00:32:30.978
Sorry, darling.
He's not moving.


283
00:32:31.013 --> 00:32:32.842
He's gonna freeze
sitting there like that.


284
00:32:32.877 --> 00:32:36.121
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.


285
00:32:37.226 --> 00:32:38.848
Are you all right?

286
00:32:41.402 --> 00:32:43.094
Come on.

287
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.786
Let's get you home, eh?

288
00:32:45.821 --> 00:32:48.340
Come on, now.

289
00:32:52.897 --> 00:32:55.278
It's all right.
MAN: There he goes.

290
00:32:58.005 --> 00:33:01.181
MAN: Fucking Jonah!
You should have
never come back.


291
00:33:09.948 --> 00:33:12.019
Lift your leg.

292
00:33:28.104 --> 00:33:30.382
It's all right
to miss him, you know.


293
00:33:32.522 --> 00:33:34.352
We all miss him.

294
00:33:36.319 --> 00:33:39.529
But it's just the two of us
and we're needing to try


295
00:33:39.564 --> 00:33:43.326
and make sure we're okay,
all right?


296
00:33:48.504 --> 00:33:51.231
If Michael was here,
things would be all right.


297
00:33:54.544 --> 00:33:56.823
What?

298
00:33:59.135 --> 00:34:01.828
If Michael was here,
things would be all right.


299
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.872
Your brother's
not coming back.


300
00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:20.363
No matter how much
we wish things were
different...


301
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:24.954
he's not coming back.

302
00:34:29.338 --> 00:34:30.891
All right?

303
00:34:36.586 --> 00:34:38.347
Look at me.

304
00:34:41.108 --> 00:34:42.213
Aaron.

305
00:34:44.663 --> 00:34:46.182
Look at me.

306
00:34:53.396 --> 00:34:54.846
Right?

307
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:28.190
CATHY: One day, the devil in
the ocean cursed the town


308
00:35:28.224 --> 00:35:30.502
and all the people in it.

309
00:35:32.194 --> 00:35:34.299
It took all the fish,

310
00:35:34.334 --> 00:35:37.302
and all the little children
in its big, dirty belly.


311
00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:43.964
And everyone was scared
and everyone was sad.


312
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:49.176
And it looked like only
darkness would remain.


313
00:35:56.459 --> 00:35:58.323
AARON: I remember
when we were young...


314
00:36:00.049 --> 00:36:02.155
and full of love.

315
00:36:03.466 --> 00:36:05.537
All we needed
was each other.


316
00:36:07.988 --> 00:36:09.990
Heaven was everywhere.

317
00:36:11.509 --> 00:36:14.961
Mama's heart was strong
and we were never scared.


318
00:36:17.204 --> 00:36:19.310
We promised
we'd always be together.


319
00:36:22.002 --> 00:36:24.211
Anything seemed possible.

320
00:37:42.082 --> 00:37:43.601
Sh. It's okay.

321
00:37:43.635 --> 00:37:46.535
Everything's
gonna be okay, I promise.


322
00:37:48.157 --> 00:37:49.538
CATHY: And the light
under the water


323
00:37:49.572 --> 00:37:52.196
would lead them
to those lost to the devil,


324
00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.338
'cause they knew only
if the beast was caught


325
00:37:56.372 --> 00:38:00.445
would the curse leave and
people would be safe again.


326
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:10.076
Nobody would ever get scared
or sad or ever be alone.


327
00:38:12.802 --> 00:38:15.460
Everyone would
live forever.


328
00:38:17.738 --> 00:38:21.294
And everything would
go back to how it was.


329
00:38:29.198 --> 00:38:31.200
AARON: I remember
what happened.


330
00:38:33.409 --> 00:38:36.067
I remember what
happened that night.


331
00:38:39.381 --> 00:38:43.109
The devil in the sea
took you in its dirty belly.


332
00:38:44.903 --> 00:38:47.285
It's to blame for all.

333
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.189
I'll cut you
from its belly.


334
00:38:54.223 --> 00:38:56.501
I will cut you
out of the devil.


335
00:38:59.642 --> 00:39:02.576
Only then will we be
together again.


336
00:39:05.441 --> 00:39:08.651
Only then will heaven
return to Earth.


337
00:40:03.982 --> 00:40:08.228
Didn't think I'd ever
be back in here again.


338
00:40:09.954 --> 00:40:13.164
Think this is the cleanest
I've ever seen it.


339
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:18.618
You all right?

340
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.172
Yeah.

341
00:40:27.247 --> 00:40:28.628
Right, that's it.What?

342
00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:32.287
Get your hands down.

343
00:40:32.321 --> 00:40:34.289
Get off. Get off.

344
00:40:36.014 --> 00:40:38.293
Did Michael ever speak
to you about me?


345
00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:47.267
Don't know.

346
00:40:48.372 --> 00:40:50.408
What kind of
things did he say?


347
00:40:53.653 --> 00:40:55.379
I don't know.

348
00:40:57.898 --> 00:41:02.317
Just that you
were the best.


349
00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:04.629
The best?

350
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.637
Do you think he thought
I was beautiful?


351
00:41:16.296 --> 00:41:17.539
Yeah.

352
00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:22.233
Say it.

353
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:31.242
He thought you
were beautiful.


354
00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.318
No, you say it.

355
00:41:42.391 --> 00:41:44.324
Like he would.

356
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.422
I think you're beautiful.

357
00:42:27.367 --> 00:42:29.300
Do you still miss me?

358
00:42:33.994 --> 00:42:37.722
Yeah. A lot.

359
00:42:43.141 --> 00:42:45.489
Say you miss me.

360
00:42:53.393 --> 00:42:55.326
I really miss you.

361
00:43:01.574 --> 00:43:03.645
Do you still love me?

362
00:43:16.623 --> 00:43:18.970
Of course
I still love you.


363
00:43:21.179 --> 00:43:22.767
I will always love you.

364
00:43:31.914 --> 00:43:34.883
And you never need to be
worried or scared or anything,


365
00:43:34.917 --> 00:43:38.680
'cause we'll be
all right.


366
00:43:42.511 --> 00:43:44.582
Everything will
be all right.


367
00:44:45.229 --> 00:44:47.093
You all right?

368
00:44:47.127 --> 00:44:48.715
I'm just waiting on Jane.

369
00:44:52.995 --> 00:44:55.584
She doesn't want to see
you right now, man.


370
00:44:58.518 --> 00:45:00.555
She says she thinks
it's best


371
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:02.246
that you don't see
each other for a while.


372
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.076
She just needs to sort herself
out, you know what I mean?


373
00:45:09.529 --> 00:45:11.738
She wouldn't say that.

374
00:45:13.533 --> 00:45:15.949
That's just
what you're saying.


375
00:45:15.984 --> 00:45:19.884
And how would you know
what she would say
or wouldn't say?


376
00:45:26.615 --> 00:45:28.755
I know
she's scared of you.


377
00:45:34.243 --> 00:45:35.935
Yeah.

378
00:45:38.558 --> 00:45:40.664
You know everything, eh?

379
00:45:45.634 --> 00:45:47.567
Do you know that...

380
00:45:48.706 --> 00:45:52.158
she sees you as
a fucking embarrassment?


381
00:45:52.192 --> 00:45:55.920
She can't stand
being around you.
Did you know that?


382
00:45:59.337 --> 00:46:01.892
She's going to help
me find Michael.


383
00:46:03.203 --> 00:46:04.550
You what?

384
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:09.278
She's going to help
me find my brother.


385
00:46:09.313 --> 00:46:11.833
Fucking hell, man.

386
00:46:11.867 --> 00:46:14.283
You're a piece of work,
aren't you?


387
00:46:14.318 --> 00:46:15.906
I know you're
out there, but


388
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.805
you are wired to the fucking
moon, big lad, aren't you?


389
00:46:20.876 --> 00:46:24.293
You see, you forget
I knew your brother,


390
00:46:24.328 --> 00:46:27.711
and I hate
to say this,


391
00:46:27.745 --> 00:46:30.058
but he wasn't everything
you thought he was.


392
00:46:31.611 --> 00:46:34.165
Aye, he knew his place
better than you did.


393
00:46:36.823 --> 00:46:39.826
But he was a wee
fucking fanny as well.


394
00:46:51.251 --> 00:46:52.977
You are...

395
00:46:55.635 --> 00:46:59.743
What am I
Tell me, what am I?


396
00:47:02.193 --> 00:47:03.747
A dick.

397
00:47:10.926 --> 00:47:14.378
If I see you around this house
again, you creepy little cunt,


398
00:47:14.412 --> 00:47:15.897
I'll fucking
kill you myself.


399
00:47:15.931 --> 00:47:17.623
Now stay away
from my daughter,


400
00:47:17.657 --> 00:47:19.625
and stay away from
my fucking house,


401
00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:22.766
or I swear to God
I will fucking kill you.


402
00:47:23.939 --> 00:47:27.598
You get it?
Now fuck off!


403
00:47:37.056 --> 00:47:39.127
Jane!

404
00:47:39.161 --> 00:47:41.923
Jane? Jane.

405
00:47:41.957 --> 00:47:43.752
What is it?It's all right.

406
00:47:43.787 --> 00:47:44.926
Just come here.

407
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.859
Come with me.Are you all right?

408
00:47:46.893 --> 00:47:48.861
What you doing back here?
Do you not listen to people?


409
00:47:48.895 --> 00:47:50.725
What the fuck
are you doing?


410
00:47:50.759 --> 00:47:52.658
Hard man come round
to my fucking house, huh?


411
00:47:53.969 --> 00:47:55.902
Dad, get off him!
Leave him!


412
00:47:55.937 --> 00:47:57.421
Dad, get off!Frank, get off.

413
00:47:57.455 --> 00:48:00.735
Get off him! Dad! Get...

414
00:48:00.769 --> 00:48:02.702
Fucking clear off
and get him out of my house.


415
00:48:02.737 --> 00:48:05.429
It's all right, it's all right.
He didn't hurt me.


416
00:48:05.463 --> 00:48:07.431
Fucking hurt you?

417
00:48:07.465 --> 00:48:08.881
That is enough!
Now, Frank...


418
00:48:08.915 --> 00:48:10.710
Get your hands off me!

419
00:48:11.987 --> 00:48:14.058
Me and you are gonna
talk when you get back.


420
00:48:20.202 --> 00:48:21.963
Look, I just don't think
seeing each other


421
00:48:21.997 --> 00:48:24.690
is such a good idea
right now, you know?


422
00:48:27.727 --> 00:48:29.177
Don't say that.

423
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.422
I know you're
different from the rest.


424
00:48:33.457 --> 00:48:34.976
I see that.I'm not.

425
00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.943
You are.

426
00:48:46.021 --> 00:48:48.127
What would you say
if I brought him back?


427
00:49:02.382 --> 00:49:04.488
Aaron, I'm sorry,
I've got to go home.


428
00:49:04.522 --> 00:49:06.386
No, please, don't.

429
00:49:06.421 --> 00:49:10.356
Jane, please, don't go.
Please. Please.


430
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.981
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't find him on my own.


431
00:49:15.016 --> 00:49:16.742
Aaron, I'm sorry,
I've got to go. Aaron.


432
00:49:16.776 --> 00:49:19.123
Jane!Get off, Aaron!

433
00:49:19.158 --> 00:49:20.469
Jane!

434
00:49:20.504 --> 00:49:22.506
Just don't leave me.

435
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.095
Look what you've
made me do.


436
00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:26.372
Get off! Get off!

437
00:49:26.406 --> 00:49:27.891
Jane.

438
00:49:30.997 --> 00:49:32.723
Jane, I'm sorry.

439
00:50:25.327 --> 00:50:27.847
AARON: If you were here,
you and Mum would be fine.


440
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:34.198
I think she could
get over me.


441
00:50:37.926 --> 00:50:40.204
But she can't
get over you.


442
00:51:04.884 --> 00:51:07.956
I'll cut you out.

443
00:51:07.991 --> 00:51:10.821
I will cut you
out of the devil.


444
00:51:12.961 --> 00:51:14.963
Right, next up
we've got Cathy.


445
00:51:16.654 --> 00:51:17.932
I didn't even
put my name down.


446
00:51:17.966 --> 00:51:18.933
No.Come on.

447
00:51:18.967 --> 00:51:20.106
On you go, Cathy.

448
00:51:23.523 --> 00:51:24.628
Come on.

449
00:51:24.662 --> 00:51:28.149
Up you come, darling.

450
00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:35.121

Aaron!

462
00:53:58.161 --> 00:54:01.095
What's happening?

463
00:54:01.129 --> 00:54:03.235
Your brother was
a good guy, eh?


464
00:54:09.517 --> 00:54:11.312
Yeah.

465
00:54:14.522 --> 00:54:17.180
So what actually
happened out there?


466
00:54:21.805 --> 00:54:23.289
Can't remember.

467
00:54:24.808 --> 00:54:26.637
Can't remember anything?

468
00:54:29.813 --> 00:54:32.022
No.

469
00:54:36.302 --> 00:54:41.273
See, some folk
are saying that


470
00:54:41.307 --> 00:54:43.654
you wanted rid
of your brother.


471
00:54:46.243 --> 00:54:48.590
That you didn't
want any witnesses.


472
00:54:50.592 --> 00:54:53.216
And that when
they found you,


473
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:57.220
you were covered in all
the other men's blood.


474
00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:06.470
I wasn't.

475
00:55:08.265 --> 00:55:09.439
No?

476
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:13.063
That's just what
I've heard, man.


477
00:55:32.634 --> 00:55:34.119
I don't want
to fight him, man.


478
00:55:34.153 --> 00:55:36.466
Go on, man.
For fuck's sake.


479
00:55:38.433 --> 00:55:41.126
Fucking hell, man.
Fight back.


480
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.405
Fight fucking back, man.
This is stupid.

481
00:55:44.439 --> 00:55:46.372
Stop being
a fucking pussy, man.


482
00:55:48.236 --> 00:55:50.238
Hit the fucking boy, man.

483
00:55:52.654 --> 00:55:54.518
And he turns round
and fights back.


484
00:55:54.553 --> 00:55:56.762
Get off me, you pedo!

485
00:55:56.796 --> 00:55:58.626
He's rag-dolling him.

486
00:56:12.295 --> 00:56:14.366
All right, man, get up.

487
00:56:16.816 --> 00:56:18.404
Get up.

488
00:56:19.267 --> 00:56:21.235
Get off him.

489
00:56:21.269 --> 00:56:22.546
Get off of him.

490
00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:25.170
Here. Get off of him,
you fucking idiot.


491
00:56:25.204 --> 00:56:26.792
Get fucking off him!

492
00:56:26.826 --> 00:56:29.519
Listen to what I'm
fucking tell you.
Get off the fucking boy.


493
00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:32.177
What the fuck
is wrong with you?


494
00:56:32.211 --> 00:56:33.661
He's half your
fucking size, boy.


495
00:56:33.695 --> 00:56:35.490
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...


496
00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:37.389
Jesus fuck, man.

497
00:56:37.423 --> 00:56:39.943
You want to try
it with me? Go.


498
00:56:39.977 --> 00:56:42.256
You're not so fucking tough
now your brother's
not here, are you?


499
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:45.535
You remember that?
You used to get your brother
to batter fuck out of me.


500
00:56:47.709 --> 00:56:51.506
What a fucking stupid
psychopath bastard, man.


501
00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.270
MICHAEL: Fucking sick of
looking after him.


502
00:56:56.304 --> 00:56:58.203
See the amount
of times that


503
00:56:58.237 --> 00:57:00.895
I've got him out
of near kick


504
00:57:00.929 --> 00:57:03.760
JANE: Don't you think you're
just a little bit harsh
on him sometimes?


505
00:57:03.794 --> 00:57:05.865
MICHAEL: How's it harsh?
How's it harsh?


506
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.972
I don't know how me looking
out for him is harsh.


507
00:57:09.006 --> 00:57:10.456
I don't know how me
stopping him


508
00:57:10.491 --> 00:57:13.425
getting his fucking
head kicked in is harsh.


509
00:57:13.459 --> 00:57:15.289
You're laughing,
you fucking idiot?


510
00:57:15.323 --> 00:57:16.980
Soon none of
this will matter.


511
00:57:17.014 --> 00:57:19.293
Funny, aye?
Funny?


512
00:57:19.327 --> 00:57:20.673
It's coming for us all.

513
00:57:20.708 --> 00:57:23.331
Beat it, you fucking idiot.
Get to fuck.


514
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:53.637
Aaron?

515
00:57:56.019 --> 00:57:57.710
Is that you?

516
00:58:02.922 --> 00:58:04.545
Aaron?

517
00:58:06.409 --> 00:58:09.929
AARON: Don't be scared.
Don't give up.


518
00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:15.728
For now you are with the
devil, but soon the light will come.

519
00:58:15.763 --> 00:58:18.938
I'll get there and I'll
swim down and I'll fight it,


520
00:58:18.973 --> 00:58:21.803
and I'll find you and will
cut you out of its belly.


521
00:58:23.391 --> 00:58:26.049
I'm coming.
I'm coming.


522
00:58:26.083 --> 00:58:31.365
GIRL: It's about a red devil
that sleeps under the water.


523
00:58:31.399 --> 00:58:33.470
When you descend
into the ocean


524
00:58:33.505 --> 00:58:35.369
if you got eaten by it,

525
00:58:35.403 --> 00:58:38.268
you'd have to live
inside its tummy.


526
00:58:41.064 --> 00:58:42.376
Stupid!

527
00:58:44.412 --> 00:58:45.689
Fuck you!

528
00:58:45.724 --> 00:58:47.415
Stupid...

529
00:58:48.554 --> 00:58:50.453
Michael, come here.

530
00:58:50.487 --> 00:58:52.696
Punch him. Punch him or
I'm gonna punch you.


531
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:57.391
He's always been
so fucking soft,


532
00:58:57.425 --> 00:58:59.082
so scared of everything.

533
00:58:59.116 --> 00:59:02.499
I see that there's a lot
of hard boys about here.


534
00:59:02.534 --> 00:59:03.604
I don't feel like
he doesn't fit in.


535
00:59:03.638 --> 00:59:04.881
I know he doesn't fit in.

536
00:59:04.915 --> 00:59:06.538
Say, "I love my brother.
He's the best."


537
00:59:06.572 --> 00:59:08.816
Never.Say it.

538
00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:11.543
MICHAEL: It's like he floats
about in some wee cloud and...


539
00:59:13.579 --> 00:59:16.548
It's like
he's never grown up.


540
00:59:35.394 --> 00:59:37.396
I will find you.

541
00:59:43.644 --> 00:59:48.373
One little boy who lost
everyone he really loved.


542
00:59:48.407 --> 00:59:51.652
He went out to the water
to find the monster.


543
01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:05.528
Mum.

544
01:00:13.846 --> 01:00:15.745
Mum.

545
01:00:41.667 --> 01:00:45.913
AARON:

546
01:01:59.227 --> 01:02:00.746
Come on.

547
01:02:02.748 --> 01:02:03.991
Come on.

548
01:02:05.268 --> 01:02:06.890
Come on.

549
01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.114
Come on.

550
01:02:47.137 --> 01:02:49.554
DR. FORBES: I really can't see
any other option now,


551
01:02:49.588 --> 01:02:52.557
I'm afraid.

552
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:54.697
We have everything
he needs here.


553
01:02:56.802 --> 01:02:58.666
CATHY: He's all I have.

554
01:02:59.667 --> 01:03:01.773
He's all I have left.

555
01:03:09.297 --> 01:03:11.541
Make sure you're ready.

556
01:03:13.716 --> 01:03:15.821
'Cause it's coming
for us now.


557
01:03:17.616 --> 01:03:19.722
I can't stop it.

558
01:03:21.689 --> 01:03:24.105
I can't get him
back on my own.


559
01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.936
I've tried. I can't
get them back on my own.


560
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.662
Come on, now.

561
01:03:28.696 --> 01:03:29.663
I can't...

562
01:03:29.697 --> 01:03:31.561
You're okay. Just...

563
01:03:38.395 --> 01:03:39.983
You're okay.

564
01:03:42.779 --> 01:03:45.851
I just miss my brother.We know.

565
01:03:47.266 --> 01:03:49.096
I miss my brother.

566
01:03:50.649 --> 01:03:52.582
You're doing fine.

567
01:03:53.652 --> 01:03:54.895
I'm sorry.

568
01:04:02.627 --> 01:04:04.214
You're doing fine.
Come on.


569
01:04:06.078 --> 01:04:07.252
I just miss my brother.

570
01:04:07.286 --> 01:04:09.875
I know.
Come on.


571
01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.091
99 elephant,

572
01:04:19.126 --> 01:04:21.680
100 elephant.

573
01:04:28.825 --> 01:04:30.240
YOUNG AARON: Michael.

574
01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.765
Michael.

575
01:04:49.846 --> 01:04:52.090
Are you in here, Michael?

576
01:05:09.935 --> 01:05:12.455
Michael, where are you?

577
01:05:12.489 --> 01:05:14.975
You're not here. Michael.

578
01:05:16.459 --> 01:05:20.083
Michael
Michael?


579
01:05:20.118 --> 01:05:21.429
Aaron.

580
01:05:21.464 --> 01:05:24.329
Aaron, stop. Stop it.
What are you doing? Aaron.


581
01:05:24.363 --> 01:05:28.402
Aaron, stop. Stop it.
What are you doing? Aaron.


582
01:05:28.436 --> 01:05:30.266
It's not fair!

583
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.854
It's all right!
It's all right.


584
01:05:31.888 --> 01:05:33.787
It's okay.
He's not there.


585
01:05:33.821 --> 01:05:35.685
Where is Michael?

586
01:05:38.032 --> 01:05:41.311
I just think it's maybe for
the best for a wee while, eh?


587
01:05:42.485 --> 01:05:44.176
Just till you're better.

588
01:05:48.387 --> 01:05:50.182
They can help you there.

589
01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:57.880
I'm just needing to know
that no matter what happens,


590
01:05:57.914 --> 01:06:01.987
you'll be all right.
Okay?


591
01:06:03.989 --> 01:06:05.957
I promise things
will get better.


592
01:06:07.855 --> 01:06:09.270
I promise.

593
01:06:13.999 --> 01:06:16.830
Remember you said

594
01:06:16.864 --> 01:06:20.005
if we stayed together,
everything would be alright?


595
01:06:24.423 --> 01:06:26.149
You said that.

596
01:06:27.944 --> 01:06:30.119
You said that all
we needed was each other.


597
01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.018
I know I did.

598
01:06:38.023 --> 01:06:40.785
But I'm not gonna be here
forever to look after you.


599
01:06:43.891 --> 01:06:46.929
I don't know how
to help you anymore.


600
01:07:09.296 --> 01:07:11.125
MAN: My mother used
to tell me...


601
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.886
AARON: I might do
something really bad.


602
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.888
MAN 1: When my father
went to sea,


603
01:07:14.922 --> 01:07:17.442
there used to be a big
red fish following him.


604
01:07:17.476 --> 01:07:19.893
MAN 2: Didn't think of anyone
else except himself.


605
01:07:19.927 --> 01:07:21.480
His brother was
probably screaming.


606
01:07:21.515 --> 01:07:23.482
MAN 3: It was all put
down to the devil.


607
01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:26.106
MAN 1: And he said that was
the devil of the sea.


608
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.108
AARON: I just want you
to give me a sign.


609
01:08:23.646 --> 01:08:25.372
Michael!

610
01:08:28.685 --> 01:08:30.273
Michael!

611
01:08:34.001 --> 01:08:35.623
Do you ever feel odd

612
01:08:35.658 --> 01:08:38.109
like just being
with us all the time?


613
01:08:38.143 --> 01:08:40.283
I don't mean it in a bad way,
but don't you?


614
01:09:06.585 --> 01:09:08.139
AARON: The devil's
going to take


615
01:09:08.173 --> 01:09:11.176
all the bad boys
and girls.


616
01:09:13.523 --> 01:09:18.321
Like it took my brother
and changed his heart.


617
01:09:18.356 --> 01:09:20.323
Fucking move.
Fucking move.


618
01:09:20.358 --> 01:09:22.084
Fuck you, man.No, fuck you.
Fuck off.


619
01:09:22.118 --> 01:09:23.982
No, you fucking
sit over there.


620
01:09:24.017 --> 01:09:25.363
Don't sit on me.

621
01:09:25.397 --> 01:09:27.020
Tell him to sit wi' you.
Michael, calm down.

622
01:09:27.054 --> 01:09:28.331
Fucking move.Don't fucking hit me.

623
01:09:28.366 --> 01:09:30.368
MICHAEL: He's a fucking
embarrassment.


624
01:09:30.402 --> 01:09:32.025
He embarrasses me.

625
01:09:32.059 --> 01:09:33.681
How do you think that
makes me feel, right?


626
01:09:33.716 --> 01:09:35.476
I'm embarrassed
of my brother.


627
01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:39.204
They don't like him here.

628
01:09:39.239 --> 01:09:41.172
They don't like him here,
that's the difference.


629
01:09:41.206 --> 01:09:43.243
I know it's coming.

630
01:09:43.277 --> 01:09:45.176
It's coming for all of you
and it's coming for me.


631
01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:48.213
And I'm the only
one who's ready.


632
01:09:50.733 --> 01:09:53.736
AARON: Unless it's stopped,
it will wipe everyone out.


633
01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:58.741
Everything will disappear.
I'm the only one who knows.


634
01:09:58.775 --> 01:10:00.985
Only then will we be
together again.


635
01:10:01.019 --> 01:10:03.056
It's coming
for every one of you.


636
01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:05.990
Only then will heaven
return to Earth.


637
01:10:07.232 --> 01:10:08.578
What the fuck's that?

638
01:10:09.786 --> 01:10:11.409
What one of youse
was that?


639
01:10:11.443 --> 01:10:13.204
You know it was you.

640
01:10:13.238 --> 01:10:15.378
You're sitting watching me.
It wasn't fucking me.


641
01:10:15.413 --> 01:10:16.966
Fucking hell, man.

642
01:10:19.141 --> 01:10:21.626
Hey!
Come on out!


643
01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.730
Come on out!

644
01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:24.215
Jesus Christ, man.

645
01:10:24.249 --> 01:10:26.976
Who's that?
Show yourself!


646
01:10:27.804 --> 01:10:28.771
Hello!

647
01:10:28.805 --> 01:10:31.049
Did you see anybody?

648
01:10:34.811 --> 01:10:37.469
Hello!
Show yourself!


649
01:10:44.062 --> 01:10:45.788
Whoa!
Get somebody!


650
01:10:45.822 --> 01:10:48.308
Get off him!Get somebody!

651
01:10:52.622 --> 01:10:54.521
AARON: I remember
when we were little,


652
01:10:54.555 --> 01:10:57.075
we'd pretend like we were fish
swimming in the ocean.


653
01:10:58.352 --> 01:11:00.699
We'd go down together,

654
01:11:00.734 --> 01:11:02.391
seeing who could stay
under the longest.


655
01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.601
Help! Help!

656
01:11:05.635 --> 01:11:08.086
Tryin' to find a light
to lead us to heaven.


657
01:11:17.095 --> 01:11:20.064
Shit. Shit.

658
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:24.620
AARON: All the time knowing

659
01:11:24.654 --> 01:11:27.450
if we'd been bad,
the devil would take us.


660
01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:31.144
Swim!

661
01:11:35.872 --> 01:11:38.151
Aaron. Aaron.

662
01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:51.060
It's all right.
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.


663
01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.718
Stay with me.

664
01:11:53.752 --> 01:11:55.858
Stay with me.
Stay with me.


665
01:11:55.892 --> 01:11:58.343
Oh, God.

666
01:12:01.243 --> 01:12:02.485
It's coming, Billy.

667
01:12:04.211 --> 01:12:05.557
Stop it, Billy, it's coming!

668
01:12:05.592 --> 01:12:07.214
It's coming!
I won't let it get you!


669
01:12:08.698 --> 01:12:11.115
It's coming. I'm not gonna
let it hurt you, Billy.


670
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:13.324
Now, you see.
You stay right here.


671
01:12:13.358 --> 01:12:15.326
It's coming.
It's coming.


672
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.190
It's coming.
It's coming.


673
01:12:18.398 --> 01:12:19.502
Hey!

674
01:12:20.883 --> 01:12:21.849
Over here!

675
01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:24.369
Help!

676
01:12:27.786 --> 01:12:31.756
I wouldn't have hurt you.
I wouldn't have hurt you, Billy.


677
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:34.172
Billy.
Swim to the boat.


678
01:12:46.874 --> 01:12:48.221
That's it.
Good, son.


679
01:12:48.255 --> 01:12:50.223
That's it.
You're safe now.


680
01:12:50.257 --> 01:12:52.570
Michael, please.
Please, help me!


681
01:12:52.604 --> 01:12:54.158
I'm sorry!

682
01:13:07.826 --> 01:13:10.139
Let me through.
Let me through!


683
01:13:13.418 --> 01:13:14.557
What happened?Oh, God.

684
01:13:14.592 --> 01:13:15.765
Oh, God.

685
01:13:20.977 --> 01:13:24.153
I'm coming.
Let him down!


686
01:13:25.327 --> 01:13:27.950
I've got you, baby.
I've got you.


687
01:13:27.984 --> 01:13:31.781
It's okay, baby.
Mummy's got you.
It's okay.


688
01:13:31.816 --> 01:13:34.336
It's all right, baby.
It's all right.


689
01:13:40.238 --> 01:13:42.482
It's okay, son.
What the hell has he done?

690
01:13:55.357 --> 01:13:57.359
You're a fucking
disgrace!


691
01:13:57.393 --> 01:13:58.843
You should have
never come back here!


692
01:13:58.877 --> 01:13:59.947
Leave him alone!

693
01:13:59.982 --> 01:14:01.225
You're a bastard.

694
01:14:01.259 --> 01:14:03.330
I hope he fucking dies!

695
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.195
Fucking leave him there!

696
01:14:07.023 --> 01:14:09.371
I don't.
I wanna stay me.


697
01:14:22.763 --> 01:14:24.696
AARON: There'll be
nothing left.


698
01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:26.560
The devil is inside everyone.
Everyone will disappear.


699
01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.700
The devil is coming
for you all.


700
01:15:11.295 --> 01:15:15.782
We're lucky the police are happy
for us to take it from here.


701
01:15:15.816 --> 01:15:19.441
I mean, obviously we'd prefer
if he came in on his own.


702
01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:25.274
But if not, then we'd have
to arrange another way
to have him picked up.


703
01:15:26.413 --> 01:15:28.553
We really don't want that.

704
01:15:31.107 --> 01:15:34.904
We just need to
look at tomorrow
as a fresh start for you.


705
01:15:36.975 --> 01:15:38.701
All right?

706
01:15:41.808 --> 01:15:43.982
Yeah.

707
01:15:44.017 --> 01:15:47.331
Now, obviously
they'll go through
everything with you there.


708
01:15:47.365 --> 01:15:48.642
But if there's anything

709
01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:51.576
that either one of you
wanna ask me just now...


710
01:15:57.513 --> 01:16:01.068
Will Mum still be able
to come with me?


711
01:16:01.103 --> 01:16:03.795
She can come
with you tomorrow,


712
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:08.352
but it is best that
you're apart for
a while, okay?


713
01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.459
Yeah.

714
01:16:21.882 --> 01:16:23.815
You okay?

715
01:16:40.038 --> 01:16:41.833
Are you all right?

716
01:16:49.945 --> 01:16:52.499
I was just trying
to do something good.


717
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:54.915
You know?

718
01:16:56.192 --> 01:16:57.539
I know.

719
01:17:07.514 --> 01:17:09.965
Look, no matter
what happens...


720
01:17:15.004 --> 01:17:17.524
...try not to let
anybody put you down...


721
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.840
...or tell you that you
should be more like them.


722
01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.501
Promise me that
you won't let them


723
01:17:28.535 --> 01:17:31.020
change the person
that you really are.


724
01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:36.509
Because they're just scared.

725
01:17:43.481 --> 01:17:45.414
We're all just scared.

726
01:18:37.742 --> 01:18:39.951
You needing anything else?

727
01:18:51.653 --> 01:18:53.517
I remember
when you were little,


728
01:18:53.551 --> 01:18:54.966
if we were going
away somewhere,


729
01:18:55.001 --> 01:18:57.659
you'd wanna take
everything with you.


730
01:18:59.626 --> 01:19:02.077
Clothes that didn't
fit you anymore or


731
01:19:02.111 --> 01:19:05.667
broken toys that you
hadn't played with for years.


732
01:19:07.807 --> 01:19:10.741
Remember if we got scared,

733
01:19:10.775 --> 01:19:13.744
you'd tell us the story
of the monster?


734
01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:26.135
Would you tell it just now?

735
01:19:30.346 --> 01:19:32.970
I can't really remember it.

736
01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:37.595
Go on.I can't remember it.

737
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.347
One day...

738
01:20:05.381 --> 01:20:09.040
the devil in the ocean
cursed the town.


739
01:20:09.075 --> 01:20:10.870
It took all the fish

740
01:20:10.904 --> 01:20:14.632
and all the little children
into its big, dirty belly.


741
01:20:16.185 --> 01:20:19.568
And everyone was scared
and everyone was sad.


742
01:20:22.778 --> 01:20:24.677
And they knew

743
01:20:24.711 --> 01:20:26.886
that only if the devil
was caught


744
01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.061
would things go back
to the way they were before.


745
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.860
Then what happened?

746
01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:43.661
One little boy...

747
01:20:45.663 --> 01:20:48.735
who'd lost everyone
he really loved...


748
01:20:50.254 --> 01:20:54.120
went out to the water
to find the monster.


749
01:20:54.154 --> 01:20:59.228
He went so far
under the water that
he turned into a fish.


750
01:20:59.263 --> 01:21:04.924
And he swam all day and all
night looking for his family.


751
01:21:10.412 --> 01:21:12.759
Then one day...

752
01:21:12.794 --> 01:21:14.727
after searching
the ocean


753
01:21:14.761 --> 01:21:17.833
so long he was ready
to give up...


754
01:21:19.801 --> 01:21:21.872
he saw the big monster

755
01:21:21.906 --> 01:21:25.669
sleeping at the bottom
of the ocean,


756
01:21:25.703 --> 01:21:28.810
and he swam right
into its mouth...


757
01:21:28.844 --> 01:21:32.710
and up into its big belly.

758
01:21:34.436 --> 01:21:36.680
And in there,

759
01:21:36.714 --> 01:21:39.648
he found all the fish,

760
01:21:39.683 --> 01:21:44.826
all the little children,
and everyone he'd ever loved.


761
01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:49.693
And then everything
was okay again?


762
01:21:53.869 --> 01:21:55.802
He set them all free...

763
01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:03.845
and the devil
was gone forever.


764
01:22:05.501 --> 01:22:08.919
The curse left the town,

765
01:22:08.953 --> 01:22:11.473
nobody got scared anymore,

766
01:22:11.507 --> 01:22:14.200
nobody got sad or ill...

767
01:22:14.234 --> 01:22:18.963
and all the little boys
and girls would live forever.


768
01:22:21.759 --> 01:22:25.211
Everything went back
to the way it was.


769
01:22:32.218 --> 01:22:33.875
I'm sorry, Mum.

770
01:22:35.221 --> 01:22:36.947
It's all right, son.

771
01:22:37.913 --> 01:22:40.019
Your mummy loves you, okay?

772
01:22:45.783 --> 01:22:47.336
It's okay.

773
01:24:17.875 --> 01:24:20.602
AARON: I remember
when we were little,


774
01:24:20.636 --> 01:24:23.363
we'd pretend
to be fish,


775
01:24:23.398 --> 01:24:26.056
swimming deep
down in the ocean,


776
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:29.128
trying to find heaven,

777
01:24:29.162 --> 01:24:31.337
looking for the lights
to take us there.


778
01:25:31.949 --> 01:25:34.262
We all changed, though.

779
01:25:36.954 --> 01:25:39.232
We forgot
what was important.


780
01:25:41.407 --> 01:25:43.305
We all forgot
how to love...


781
01:25:45.652 --> 01:25:47.240
how to dream.

782
01:25:51.451 --> 01:25:55.041
We need to go back
to how things were before.


783
01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.460
We need to go back.

784
01:26:37.773 --> 01:26:39.189
Where are you going?

785
01:26:39.223 --> 01:26:41.985
They've found him.

786
01:26:42.019 --> 01:26:44.090
They've found him.

787
01:26:48.784 --> 01:26:50.131
Cathy!

788
01:26:50.165 --> 01:26:51.960
Cathy, come back!

789
01:26:53.237 --> 01:26:55.170
They've found him.
