00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.207
I LOVE YOU

2
00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:18.386
4th OF JULY CROAKER FESTIVAL

3
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:33.735
Let's welcome back
our six finalists to the stage.


4
00:04:35.237 --> 00:04:38.990
They're pretty as can be,
aren't they?


5
00:04:39.157 --> 00:04:44.162
You worked hard. Your parents
worked hard. We're proud of you.


6
00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:57.384
She was born for this.

7
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:04.140
- Her breasts are so... ample.
- She does exercises to pump 'em up.


8
00:05:04.307 --> 00:05:10.230
Guys, I'm on sexist overload
as it is. Kill the commentary.


9
00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:14.818
"In the spirit of Mother Teresa,
what will be your contribution -


10
00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:19.447
- to your community
and the world at large?"


11
00:05:19.614 --> 00:05:26.913
At summer's end, I plan to become
a serious actress in New York City.


12
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.212
By entertaining the world through
art, I shall serve my country.


13
00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:41.428
Did you feed her this shit?

14
00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:46.933
Work it. Babe!
They're eating it up.


15
00:05:52.022 --> 00:05:59.279
And this year's Croaker Queen is:
Miss Helen Shivers.


16
00:06:05.744 --> 00:06:08.955
That's my girl!

17
00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:16.087
That's my girlfriend!

18
00:06:52.165 --> 00:06:55.585
- How's my hair?
- Hurricane-proof.


19
00:06:55.752 --> 00:07:00.298
It's all about hair. Don't forget it
when you become a big lawyer.


20
00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:05.428
Professional women think it's all
about brains, and ignore the "do".


21
00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:09.015
The "do" is vital. Got it.

22
00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:14.980
- Are you riding with me?
- No. Tell Mom I'll be home late.


23
00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:21.778
- Is Miss Croaker gonna get sautÃ©ed?
- A twit with a wit.


24
00:07:25.282 --> 00:07:31.788
- Julie. A shooter on the house.
- I can't get past the slime.


25
00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:36.376
How about I take you out
before you leave town?


26
00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:44.050
I don't think so. Max.

27
00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:48.638
We've been friends since forever.
You can't leave without a farewell.


28
00:07:50.182 --> 00:07:53.643
A toast... to us.

29
00:07:54.352 --> 00:07:59.858
To our last summer of immature.
Adolescent decadence.


30
00:08:00.942 --> 00:08:06.615
- Somebody's buzzed.
- Chum bait. Take a hike.


31
00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:12.954
- Easy, easy!
- Barry, they're just friends.


32
00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:17.501
Come on. This is tired.

33
00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:24.716
- I'm just taking care of your girl.
- Thanks, buddy. Let's blow.


34
00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:30.055
Let's beam down to Dawson's Beach.
A little joyride.


35
00:08:35.185 --> 00:08:38.230
Bye.

36
00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:54.412
They're making out
when they hear over the radio -


37
00:08:54.579 --> 00:09:00.627
- that a killer with a hook for a
hand escaped from the insane asylum.


38
00:09:00.794 --> 00:09:07.634
- You're telling it wrong.
- Shut up. The girl gets all scared.


39
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:12.556
She wants to go home.
The boy gets pissed and peels out.


40
00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:17.435
No, the boy goes for help
and the girl stays in the car.


41
00:09:17.602 --> 00:09:24.442
- She hears a scratching sound...
- It's not a scratch, it's a drip.


42
00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:29.948
No, the guy's been hung from a tree.
His feet are scratching the roof.


43
00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:36.288
No, he's been decapitated,
and the blood's dripping on the car.


44
00:09:36.454 --> 00:09:41.126
No, he wasn't decapitated,
he was gutted with a hook.


45
00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:48.300
- That's the way I heard it.
- You're all wrong.


46
00:09:48.466 --> 00:09:54.764
They get to the girl's house and
find a bloody hook in the car door.


47
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.519
That's the original story.
That's the way it really happened.


48
00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:03.523
None of it really happened.
It's a bullshit story.


49
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:09.988
- No. It's not. It's true.
- I don't think so, Ray.


50
00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:14.618
It's a fictional story to warn girls
of the dangers of premarital sex.


51
00:10:14.784 --> 00:10:23.126
You know how terrified I am of
your I.Q., but it's an urban legend.


52
00:10:23.293 --> 00:10:29.132
And they all originate from
some sort of real-life incident.


53
00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:49.319
By that time I'll be finishing my
two-year deal on "Guiding Light", -


54
00:10:49.486 --> 00:10:55.992
- coinciding with your first year
as quarterback for the Steelers.


55
00:10:56.159 --> 00:11:02.082
Then we can elope to Europe
or the Caymans, -


56
00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:06.670
- where I'll let you impregnate me
with the first of three children. -


57
00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:11.007
- before you head off to rehab.

58
00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:15.971
Then we can live happily...
blah. Blah. Blah.


59
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.185
Ray? Where did you go?

60
00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:26.606
I'm gonna hook you!

61
00:11:27.482 --> 00:11:31.653
- Do you really believe that crap?
- It's true.


62
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.783
The hook is really a phallic symbol.
Ultimately castrated.


63
00:11:38.076 --> 00:11:41.121
I'm gonna miss you.

64
00:11:41.288 --> 00:11:45.917
You can always ditch Boston
and come to New York with me.


65
00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:51.298
We can't all sit in coffee-houses
and ramble on our laptops.


66
00:11:51.464 --> 00:11:57.137
- Nobody gets me the way you do.
- I understand your pain.


67
00:11:57.304 --> 00:12:00.265
I hate this.

68
00:12:00.432 --> 00:12:06.479
You're gonna fall for a head-shaven,
body-piercing philosophy student.


69
00:12:06.646 --> 00:12:12.819
- That sounds attractive.
- I'll never see you again.


70
00:12:12.986 --> 00:12:19.659
High-school relationships are more
successful than any other kind.


71
00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:24.247
Cite your source.

72
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.262
Are you sure?

73
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.999
- Give me the keys.
- Nobody drives my car but me.


74
00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:13.004
I know, baby, but the Croaker Queen
has to get home now.


75
00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:17.467
- Hey, you two.
- Give me my fucking keys.


76
00:13:17.634 --> 00:13:22.472
Come ride in the back with me.
I'll let you do things to me.


77
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:27.352
- Nobody drives my car but me.
- Get in the car.


78
00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:44.828
You can't drive for shit.

79
00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:49.541
Can you say "alcoholic"?

80
00:13:54.588 --> 00:13:58.633
What the hell is this crap?

81
00:14:15.692 --> 00:14:17.861
What's wrong with you?

82
00:14:19.154 --> 00:14:21.573
Watch out!

83
00:14:29.206 --> 00:14:32.542
- What was that?
- Is everybody okay?


84
00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:37.547
- I think it was an animal.
- You're bleeding.


85
00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:43.053
- It's not mine.
- It must have been a dog.


86
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.973
Jesus Christ, my fucking car!

87
00:14:51.436 --> 00:14:56.066
- Can't you see where you're going?
- It came out of nowhere.


88
00:14:56.233 --> 00:15:00.403
- A dog couldn't have done that.
- A deer could.


89
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:05.158
- My dad's gonna freak on my ass.
- It was an accident.


90
00:15:05.325 --> 00:15:10.288
- If it was a deer. Where is it?
- Maybe it ran off.


91
00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:15.168
- I hope we didn't kill it.
- Oh, my God...


92
00:15:22.926 --> 00:15:26.179
- No way.
- I thought...


93
00:15:26.346 --> 00:15:30.600
- I didn't see it.
- There's no way.


94
00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:33.770
This isn't happening.

95
00:15:37.232 --> 00:15:40.777
Check that side.

96
00:15:50.412 --> 00:15:55.000
I couldn't see it.
I swear!


97
00:15:55.167 --> 00:16:01.131
<i>- Is he dead?
- Check his pulse. You rammed him!</i>


98
00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:26.448
I think he's dead.

99
00:16:29.201 --> 00:16:35.373
- Who is he?
- His face is all messed up.


100
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.879
- What was he doing out here?
- We've got to get an ambulance.


101
00:16:41.046 --> 00:16:43.965
What's your hurry?

102
00:16:44.132 --> 00:16:48.512
- The guy's dead.
- You're not a doctor.


103
00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:52.849
Use your brain, Julie.
If we call the police, we're fucked.


104
00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:56.728
- It was an accident.
- Let's think about this.


105
00:16:56.895 --> 00:17:02.692
Think about what? He crossed
the road in the middle of the night.


106
00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:08.406
- You weren't drinking or speeding.
- They won't believe I was driving.


107
00:17:08.573 --> 00:17:13.995
- It's my car. They'll nail my ass.
- That's not true.


108
00:17:14.162 --> 00:17:17.791
I'm drunk as shit. I'm fucked!

109
00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:21.294
We'll call the police
and tell the truth.


110
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:25.632
It's manslaughter.

111
00:17:26.466 --> 00:17:31.012
- We're gonna fry no matter what.
- Then we leave now.


112
00:17:31.179 --> 00:17:33.849
Are you crazy?

113
00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:38.353
- The grille's busted and bloody.
- We can clean it up.


114
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:45.110
- We're going to the police!
- We don't have time for your shit!


115
00:17:45.277 --> 00:17:50.198
Let's try to stay calm.

116
00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:57.038
<i>If there's some of the car on him.
You're looking at a hit-and-run!</i>


117
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:02.127
- Then we dump the body.
- You've lost it.


118
00:18:02.294 --> 00:18:06.715
- Let's pretend we were never here.
- We'll dump him in the water.


119
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.137
When they find him,
the evidence will be washed away.


120
00:18:12.304 --> 00:18:16.099
If they found him at all.

121
00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:22.772
Maybe the undertow could carry him
out to sea.


122
00:18:22.939 --> 00:18:26.193
I won't be any part of it.

123
00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:29.654
I'm scared. Julie.
I'm not like the rest of you.


124
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:36.161
I don't have the family or money
to get me out of this. Please.


125
00:18:36.328 --> 00:18:44.336
This is your future, Julie. Think
about college. Your scholarship.


126
00:18:44.503 --> 00:18:50.634
The guy's already dead. If we go
to the police, we're dead too.


127
00:18:58.934 --> 00:19:02.771
- What do we do?
- Help me.


128
00:19:08.777 --> 00:19:11.780
They're slowing down.

129
00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:14.866
- Who is it?
- It's Max.


130
00:19:15.033 --> 00:19:18.995
Get rid of him.

131
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.713
- Have you got car trouble?
- Actually...


132
00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:34.553
Barry had too much to drink. We
don't want upchuck in the new car.


133
00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:39.266
- It doesn't look so new anymore.
- Yeah. Don't drink and drive.


134
00:19:39.432 --> 00:19:42.102
Daddy's gonna be mad.

135
00:19:45.772 --> 00:19:50.527
- What can I do for you, Max?
- Wipe that grin off your face.


136
00:19:54.823 --> 00:19:59.661
Okay, Max, will do.
Have a good night.


137
00:20:00.954 --> 00:20:06.168
- You got that rich boy act down.
- We'll be seeing you.


138
00:20:09.588 --> 00:20:13.091
Take care. Julie.

139
00:21:00.764 --> 00:21:04.434
Even if his body washes ashore, -

140
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:09.022
- he'll be eaten by crabs
and small fish.


141
00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:12.901
Maybe we'll get lucky with a shark.

142
00:21:13.985 --> 00:21:17.489
Take him to the side.

143
00:21:20.659 --> 00:21:24.079
Put him down.

144
00:21:29.793 --> 00:21:33.797
- Let's do it.
- Wait.


145
00:21:33.964 --> 00:21:38.593
- Should we find out who he is?
- Why?


146
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.056
- Just to know.
- I don't want to know.


147
00:21:43.223 --> 00:21:48.103
Let's just pretend he's an escaped
lunatic with a hook. Ray, help me.


148
00:21:51.773 --> 00:21:58.196
- I don't think I can.
- Barry, it's not too late.


149
00:21:58.363 --> 00:22:04.202
- You, just shut up!
- Christ. I'll do it.


150
00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:10.500
Get him off me!

151
00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:15.839
My crown!
He's got my crown!


152
00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:47.579
Over here!

153
00:23:02.511 --> 00:23:06.139
- Let's get out of here.
- We're going home now.


154
00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:14.439
Never, under any circumstances,
speak about this again.


155
00:23:14.606 --> 00:23:20.111
It's now merely
a future therapy bill. Agreed?


156
00:23:22.614 --> 00:23:27.953
- I'll never mention it again.
- We'll make a pact.


157
00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:32.082
We take this to our grave.

158
00:23:32.916 --> 00:23:35.710
Julie?

159
00:23:37.295 --> 00:23:41.883
- Don't nod! You fucking say it!
- Yeah, okay.


160
00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:46.763
- "We take this to our grave."
- Let her go.


161
00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:53.103
- You fucking say it.
- We take this to the grave.


162
00:24:01.486 --> 00:24:05.156
It'll be okay.

163
00:24:29.639 --> 00:24:32.809
ONE YEAR LATER

164
00:24:48.992 --> 00:24:51.578
It's time to go.

165
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:59.377
Move your tired, ugly ass.
We're late.


166
00:24:59.544 --> 00:25:02.464
I changed my mind.

167
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:07.677
<i>Get your white-as-death corpse
in the car.</i>


168
00:25:11.306 --> 00:25:14.601
Come on!

169
00:25:14.768 --> 00:25:19.689
You're going home for the summer
to get a tan on your pale tail.


170
00:25:21.858 --> 00:25:24.069
Let's go.

171
00:25:47.509 --> 00:25:52.222
Remember. Sun and fun.

172
00:25:58.228 --> 00:26:01.898
Julie? Welcome home. Dear.

173
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:09.656
I missed you.

174
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.662
How's the snapper?

175
00:26:17.414 --> 00:26:21.877
I really wanted monkfish,
but it's been a bad season.


176
00:26:25.589 --> 00:26:29.092
- Are you on drugs?
- What?


177
00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:32.512
I just wanted an honest reaction.

178
00:26:33.513 --> 00:26:38.643
No, Mom. No drugs.

179
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:44.608
Then what is wrong?
You look like death.


180
00:26:45.358 --> 00:26:48.445
I've had a rough year.

181
00:27:10.383 --> 00:27:12.469
CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT

182
00:27:13.887 --> 00:27:20.143
You got some mail.
Your report card came last week.


183
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.314
I know it looks bad.
But the summer session went well.


184
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:30.487
- It's also your last chance.
- It's not that serious.


185
00:27:30.654 --> 00:27:33.615
What happened to my daughter?

186
00:27:33.782 --> 00:27:39.079
You went away,
and you don't call or visit.


187
00:27:39.246 --> 00:27:43.333
Your father must be turning over
in his grave.


188
00:27:59.182 --> 00:28:02.185
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER!


189
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:17.075
Who sent this? There's
no postmark or return address.


190
00:28:17.242 --> 00:28:21.746
- Why? What does it say?
- Nothing.


191
00:29:49.292 --> 00:29:55.131
Guys, easy...
It's called glass. It breaks.


192
00:29:58.176 --> 00:30:01.012
Good morning.

193
00:30:08.186 --> 00:30:12.357
Well, look what the cat drug in.

194
00:30:12.524 --> 00:30:18.446
Elsa. Hi. I need to talk to Helen.
Can you give me her New York number?


195
00:30:18.613 --> 00:30:22.909
- Her New York number?
- Yeah. I need to talk to her.


196
00:30:23.076 --> 00:30:29.791
Helen doesn't have a New York
number. Try Women's Fragrances.


197
00:30:33.587 --> 00:30:37.048
Frightening, isn't it?

198
00:30:37.215 --> 00:30:40.802
Julie.

199
00:30:43.013 --> 00:30:47.100
- When did you get home?
- Yesterday.


200
00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:52.647
- It's good to see you.
- What happened to New York?


201
00:30:52.814 --> 00:30:57.235
I went for a while.
It didn't really work out.


202
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.161
Somebody sent this to me.

203
00:31:06.328 --> 00:31:10.582
- Somebody knows.
- How?


204
00:31:10.749 --> 00:31:15.712
- I don't know.
- We were so careful.


205
00:31:15.879 --> 00:31:20.675
What if somebody else
was there that night?


206
00:31:20.842 --> 00:31:24.930
- Who? It's been a year.
- I don't know.


207
00:31:27.265 --> 00:31:29.976
Has Barry seen this?

208
00:31:31.853 --> 00:31:36.316
<i>- Do you ever see Barry at school?
- It's a big campus. He is back?</i>


209
00:31:37.275 --> 00:31:42.614
- I saw his car at the gym.
- Did you guys break up?


210
00:31:45.659 --> 00:31:49.204
What are you two doing here?

211
00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:56.044
Hi, Barry.

212
00:32:01.842 --> 00:32:07.764
"I know what you did last summer."
What a crock of shit.


213
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:14.604
- We need help.
- I'll say, you two look like shit.


214
00:32:14.771 --> 00:32:17.190
You're a prick.

215
00:32:17.357 --> 00:32:23.238
- We can't just ignore it.
- How do you know it's related?


216
00:32:23.405 --> 00:32:27.284
- You did a lot last summer.
- Only one murder comes to mind.


217
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.328
You shut the hell up!

218
00:32:33.999 --> 00:32:38.753
- We didn't murder anyone.
- He was still alive.


219
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.257
He was in the middle of the road.

220
00:32:42.424 --> 00:32:46.219
- His name was David Egan.
- Who?


221
00:32:46.386 --> 00:32:52.809
David Egan. He was found
three weeks after we...


222
00:32:52.976 --> 00:32:59.816
His body was caught in a shrimp net.
It was in the paper.


223
00:32:59.983 --> 00:33:04.571
I think the police called it
an accidental drowning.


224
00:33:04.738 --> 00:33:09.075
But he died because of us.
That's certain.


225
00:33:12.204 --> 00:33:18.502
What about Ray? Have you shown
the letter to him? What does he say?


226
00:33:18.668 --> 00:33:23.715
We broke up last summer. Last
I heard, he was working up north.


227
00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:33.642
Let's suppose someone was there.
Why send a letter one year later?


228
00:33:33.808 --> 00:33:37.896
It's probably some crack
fucking around.


229
00:33:40.357 --> 00:33:44.110
Max.

230
00:33:44.277 --> 00:33:48.198
- Max, you think?
- Who else? He was there.


231
00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:58.416
You two wait here.
I know what I'm doing.


232
00:34:05.048 --> 00:34:10.387
Go figure. I was just wondering
what happened to that Barry Cox.


233
00:34:10.554 --> 00:34:17.686
Hey, Max. Can we talk a second,
in private?


234
00:34:17.853 --> 00:34:21.898
This isn't private enough for you?

235
00:34:27.737 --> 00:34:29.823
What?

236
00:34:31.658 --> 00:34:34.077
We got your letter.

237
00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:38.248
- Don't fuck with me. You saw us.
- What the fuck are you on?


238
00:34:39.583 --> 00:34:44.462
I'll say this once. I'll kill you.
I have no problem with that.


239
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:47.883
- Get off of me!
- Understand?


240
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:05.775
Motherfucker.
Don't you test me.


241
00:35:05.942 --> 00:35:09.029
I'll call the cops on your ass.

242
00:35:09.196 --> 00:35:15.577
- Did he admit to the letter?
- He won't bother you anymore.


243
00:35:15.744 --> 00:35:19.998
I scared the shit out of him.

244
00:35:21.249 --> 00:35:24.336
Well. I'll be damned.

245
00:35:31.092 --> 00:35:33.637
So Ray's a fisherman.

246
00:35:33.803 --> 00:35:39.142
Yeah, almost a year now.
I work on that one over there.


247
00:35:39.309 --> 00:35:41.520
That's nice.

248
00:35:41.686 --> 00:35:46.483
Have a nice life, guys.
I'm out of here.


249
00:35:49.194 --> 00:35:52.155
Have you got a minute?

250
00:35:52.322 --> 00:35:59.329
I've got to get back to work.
Call me, we can get together.


251
00:36:08.129 --> 00:36:10.382
We need to talk.

252
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.595
- And you think Max sent it?
- Barry does.


253
00:36:15.762 --> 00:36:23.103
He's probably just screwing around.
He doesn't have much else to do.


254
00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:31.236
- So... how's school?
- So, you're a fisherman.


255
00:36:31.403 --> 00:36:35.699
Prophecy fulfilled.
I've become my father.


256
00:36:35.866 --> 00:36:41.329
- I didn't think you knew your dad.
- All I know is he worked the boats.


257
00:36:43.123 --> 00:36:48.420
I know you hold me responsible
for what happened last summer.


258
00:36:48.587 --> 00:36:55.969
No, I'm responsible for
my own actions. I don't blame you.


259
00:36:57.429 --> 00:37:02.726
But I don't want to know you either.

260
00:39:05.974 --> 00:39:09.102
Hello?

261
00:39:37.964 --> 00:39:41.259
Hello?

262
00:39:50.644 --> 00:39:53.313
I KNOW

263
00:40:30.183 --> 00:40:33.103
My fucking jacket!

264
00:40:35.647 --> 00:40:39.276
Hank, is anybody else here?

265
00:40:39.442 --> 00:40:42.863
Just you and me.

266
00:40:47.576 --> 00:40:50.412
You fucker!

267
00:40:59.754 --> 00:41:02.799
Max, you're fucking dead.

268
00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.482
Help me!

269
00:42:00.649 --> 00:42:05.654
Help me! Somebody!

270
00:42:11.743 --> 00:42:15.497
What do you want?

271
00:42:22.504 --> 00:42:28.468
I'm sorry.
I swear. We didn't mean it.


272
00:42:31.721 --> 00:42:35.308
One moment please, Officer.

273
00:42:43.233 --> 00:42:48.280
- Julie...
- What happened?


274
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.368
No. For the fortieth time.
I couldn't see his face.


275
00:42:53.535 --> 00:42:57.539
Somebody tried to kill you.
We have to go to the police.


276
00:42:57.706 --> 00:43:03.003
If he wanted me dead. He could
have done it. He's fucking with us.


277
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:06.339
- Who is?
- Some guy in a slicker.


278
00:43:06.506 --> 00:43:09.968
That narrows it down.
This being a fishing village.


279
00:43:10.135 --> 00:43:15.640
Since you bring it up...
You have a slicker.


280
00:43:17.767 --> 00:43:22.647
- You're not gonna throw this on me.
- This isn't getting us anywhere.


281
00:43:26.776 --> 00:43:30.071
Maybe we should come clean.

282
00:43:30.238 --> 00:43:34.701
No. We made a pact,
and we're gonna keep it.


283
00:43:34.868 --> 00:43:39.289
That's insane. Look at us.
The secret's killing us.


284
00:43:39.456 --> 00:43:42.209
We're not going to the police.

285
00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:47.214
We can put an end to it, and
salvage a small fraction of a life.


286
00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:54.971
It was murder. Julie.
Your words. Remember? Murder.


287
00:43:56.765 --> 00:44:01.853
- We find this guy and fix him up.
- Like last night?


288
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:07.609
He's right. This guy won't go to the
police. We'll find him, talk to him.


289
00:44:09.778 --> 00:44:12.614
How do we find him?

290
00:44:12.781 --> 00:44:17.911
It has to be a friend or family
member of... What was his name?


291
00:44:21.581 --> 00:44:27.254
- David Egan.
- Right. David Egan.


292
00:44:29.381 --> 00:44:32.634
It could still be Max.

293
00:44:32.801 --> 00:44:37.931
- Then find him. Prove Barry wrong.
- I just want for you and me...


294
00:44:38.098 --> 00:44:43.186
Listen to me. Get something.
There is no "you and me".


295
00:44:54.072 --> 00:44:59.327
I can access the local library
and pull up all we need to know.


296
00:44:59.494 --> 00:45:02.122
Egan... David.

297
00:45:04.916 --> 00:45:09.921
- All these articles are about him?
- Yeah. Or at least mention him.


298
00:45:11.923 --> 00:45:15.343
Wait. July 5th, two years ago.
What's this?


299
00:45:16.178 --> 00:45:21.892
"Susie Willis drowned, trapped in
a car near Dawson's Beach."


300
00:45:22.058 --> 00:45:26.313
- "The driver, Egan, was unharmed."
- I remember that wreck.


301
00:45:26.479 --> 00:45:31.067
Susie was engaged to David.

302
00:45:31.234 --> 00:45:35.363
Her name was tattooed on his arm.
I saw it.


303
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:41.703
"Survived by his mother, Claire, and
sister, Melissa, of Maribel County."


304
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:45.957
They live in the sticks.
What do you think?


305
00:45:46.124 --> 00:45:48.752
What have we got to lose?

306
00:45:54.049 --> 00:45:57.344
Turn right...
Back there.


307
00:46:09.648 --> 00:46:15.403
Do we just say, "We killed your son
and we were nearby, so..."


308
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.697
We play it by ear.

309
00:46:17.864 --> 00:46:22.577
Angela Lansbury always had a plan.

310
00:46:32.379 --> 00:46:36.091
What if they recognize us?
They could shoot us.


311
00:46:36.258 --> 00:46:39.761
They could've done that already.

312
00:46:39.928 --> 00:46:43.390
Jodie Foster tried this.
A serial killer opened the door.


313
00:46:57.737 --> 00:47:01.116
Well, it was a good try.

314
00:47:12.294 --> 00:47:15.755
Adding "breaking and entering"
to our crimes?


315
00:47:15.922 --> 00:47:19.843
Can I help you?

316
00:47:22.053 --> 00:47:27.517
Hi. Our car stalled down the road.
Can we use your phone?


317
00:47:37.152 --> 00:47:41.615
- The phone's over there.
- Thanks.


318
00:47:41.781 --> 00:47:46.745
Jodie.
Will you call Triple-A?


319
00:47:47.787 --> 00:47:51.917
You got it... Angela.

320
00:48:08.183 --> 00:48:12.562
My name is Missy Egan.
Are you girls from Maribel?


321
00:48:12.729 --> 00:48:16.316
- No, Southport.
- I went to Southport High.


322
00:48:16.483 --> 00:48:21.655
- You looked familiar. What year?
- Class of '88.


323
00:48:21.822 --> 00:48:28.328
Your name, "Egan", sounds familiar.
Did you have a brother?


324
00:48:28.495 --> 00:48:31.873
I did, but he was younger than me.
David.


325
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.127
- What class was he?
- '92. But he died last July.


326
00:48:36.294 --> 00:48:40.882
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.


327
00:48:41.049 --> 00:48:45.554
Do you live alone?

328
00:48:46.513 --> 00:48:49.266
Yeah. I do.

329
00:48:49.432 --> 00:48:54.604
My daddy died a long time ago
and my mother's in a home.


330
00:48:54.771 --> 00:48:59.067
She didn't take too well
to what happened to David.


331
00:48:59.234 --> 00:49:03.780
Things haven't been the same
since he died.


332
00:49:07.742 --> 00:49:10.662
They're on their way.

333
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:15.292
I could make you guys a cup of tea
while you're waiting.


334
00:49:15.458 --> 00:49:19.504
- Thanks.
- That's nice of you.


335
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:39.774
I think I remember David.
He had a friend. What was his name?


336
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:44.362
Didn't he hang out with this guy...?
What was his name?


337
00:49:44.529 --> 00:49:49.409
I didn't know too many
of David's friends.


338
00:49:51.786 --> 00:49:54.998
There was one guy...

339
00:49:55.165 --> 00:50:03.215
He stopped by not too long after
David's death, to pay his respects.


340
00:50:03.381 --> 00:50:09.221
He was a really nice guy.
He was cute and smart and...


341
00:50:10.347 --> 00:50:16.269
We were sweet on each other for
a minute or so. But it didn't work.


342
00:50:16.436 --> 00:50:21.399
He never said it. But I think
it hurt him to be around me.


343
00:50:23.985 --> 00:50:28.573
- Where is this old friend now?
- Oh. I don't know.


344
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:32.118
- Do you remember his name?
- Billy.


345
00:50:32.285 --> 00:50:36.540
- Did he have a last name?
- Blue. Billy Blue.


346
00:50:37.499 --> 00:50:44.047
- We should wait back at the car.
- Don't be ridiculous. Stay.


347
00:50:44.214 --> 00:50:48.885
- I don't want to miss Triple-A.
- We appreciate the phone.


348
00:50:49.052 --> 00:50:53.306
Any time. I don't get
too many knocks on my door nowadays.


349
00:50:53.473 --> 00:50:58.019
- Are you okay?
- I wigged out. I'm sorry.


350
00:50:59.521 --> 00:51:04.901
Being in his house
and seeing his sister...


351
00:51:05.652 --> 00:51:11.575
- God, do you see what we've done?
- It was an accident.


352
00:51:13.827 --> 00:51:18.081
We killed a man. Then ruined
the lives of everyone he knew.


353
00:51:18.248 --> 00:51:23.628
We're not that powerful.
You're giving us too much credit.


354
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:32.596
- You forgot your cigarettes.
- Thank you.


355
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:40.854
- I see you got the car started.
- Yeah, it started right up.


356
00:51:41.021 --> 00:51:44.608
Funny how that happens.

357
00:52:02.459 --> 00:52:08.256
- So what now?
- Now we try and find Billy Blue.


358
00:52:13.386 --> 00:52:17.265
Maybe he wanted to die.

359
00:52:17.432 --> 00:52:21.102
- What?
- David Egan.


360
00:52:21.269 --> 00:52:26.107
His girlfriend died on the same
road, July 4th, one year earlier.


361
00:52:26.274 --> 00:52:31.363
Maybe he was sitting in the road,
waiting for us to hit him.


362
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:36.034
Yeah, if that will help you
sleep at night.


363
00:52:37.327 --> 00:52:42.290
What happened between us?
We used to be best friends.


364
00:52:43.625 --> 00:52:46.503
We used to be a lot of things.

365
00:52:47.546 --> 00:52:50.674
I miss you.

366
00:53:31.506 --> 00:53:33.884
Hey, Dad.

367
00:55:48.101 --> 00:55:52.731
Is the washed-up has-been
having a moment?


368
00:55:54.608 --> 00:55:57.235
What do you want?

369
00:55:57.402 --> 00:56:01.740
We're doing inventory tomorrow.
I need you there by 10.


370
00:56:01.907 --> 00:56:07.162
I can't. I'm in the parade tomorrow.

371
00:56:07.329 --> 00:56:13.251
Dad put me in charge of the store,
and I want you there by 10.


372
00:56:13.418 --> 00:56:17.839
The outgoing queen
has to ride in the parade.


373
00:56:18.006 --> 00:56:21.718
It's tradition.
There's nothing I can do about it.


374
00:56:23.136 --> 00:56:28.058
You and your hair...
It's so pathetic.


375
00:56:28.225 --> 00:56:33.647
- You can leave now.
- So very pathetic.


376
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:55.437
SOON

377
00:58:04.154 --> 00:58:09.117
What?
Oh, my God...


378
00:59:24.025 --> 00:59:26.736
Max...

379
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:53.847
- Are you sure he was dead?
- I saw him... with these crabs.


380
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:58.226
You do it.

381
01:00:09.404 --> 01:00:14.868
He was there. And he was
wearing your jacket, Barry.


382
01:00:15.035 --> 01:00:20.582
- Did the crabs carry him away?
- I believe you, Julie.


383
01:00:20.749 --> 01:00:24.878
- He took the body.
- Why would he do that?


384
01:00:25.045 --> 01:00:30.926
Why did he try to run you over,
and make coleslaw on Helen's head?


385
01:00:31.092 --> 01:00:35.931
- Let's go back to the house.
- Where's your jacket, Barry?


386
01:00:36.097 --> 01:00:43.271
Don't you see? He's got us.
We can't go to the police now.


387
01:00:43.438 --> 01:00:48.485
He's watching us and waiting.
What are you waiting for?


388
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:53.365
What are you waiting for?

389
01:00:58.286 --> 01:01:00.372
What are you doing here?

390
01:01:00.539 --> 01:01:04.042
- I've been looking for you guys.
- You're gonna die.


391
01:01:05.335 --> 01:01:09.089
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.


392
01:01:09.256 --> 01:01:13.176
- You're fucking lying!
- Leave him alone. Get a grip.


393
01:01:13.343 --> 01:01:19.349
- Wake up, Julie. He's behind this.
- He's after me. Too.


394
01:01:21.268 --> 01:01:24.396
I got a letter.

395
01:01:24.563 --> 01:01:29.109
A letter? I got run over,
Helen gets her hair chopped off, -


396
01:01:29.276 --> 01:01:35.157
- Julie gets a body in a trunk, and
you get a letter. That's balanced.


397
01:01:35.323 --> 01:01:40.370
- You killed Max and took my jacket.
- Max is dead?


398
01:01:40.537 --> 01:01:47.043
You always wanted to be our friend,
but were too jealous to handle it.


399
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:50.380
Fuck you.

400
01:01:50.547 --> 01:01:55.051
We have to stick together.
Help each other.


401
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:06.188
So if it's not fisherboy here,
who is it?


402
01:02:06.354 --> 01:02:11.860
- We think his name is Billy Blue.
- How do you know that?


403
01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:16.364
- David had a friend by that name.
- He's probably a school friend.


404
01:02:16.531 --> 01:02:20.660
According to his sister,
that would make him class of '92.


405
01:02:20.827 --> 01:02:25.207
Elsa was class of '92. Maybe
there's something in her yearbook.


406
01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:29.669
It's hard to believe that's the guy.

407
01:02:29.836 --> 01:02:32.506
His face isn't splattered
on the road.


408
01:02:34.257 --> 01:02:41.556
- Maybe Blue's not his real name.
- He could have lied to Missy.


409
01:02:41.723 --> 01:02:45.769
- If we bring the book to Missy...
- She could point him out.


410
01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:49.606
I'm not going anywhere.

411
01:02:50.899 --> 01:02:54.528
High school mugshots...

412
01:02:55.695 --> 01:03:00.408
- I'll go. You've got that parade.
- Forget it.


413
01:03:00.575 --> 01:03:04.287
- You have to, in case he shows up.
- I don't want him to!


414
01:03:04.454 --> 01:03:08.583
This could be our chance.
We could catch him.


415
01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:14.589
I'll go to Missy's. Barry, you go
with Helen. If he shows up...


416
01:03:14.756 --> 01:03:17.259
I'll pound his ass.

417
01:03:17.425 --> 01:03:21.221
- You sound like vigilantes.
- It's July 4th, Ray.


418
01:03:21.388 --> 01:03:26.268
Whatever he has planned is gonna
happen today, unless we stop him.


419
01:03:26.434 --> 01:03:32.524
Don't you see? It's that moment
where we have to make a decision.


420
01:03:33.316 --> 01:03:38.864
- Let's make the right one.
- I'll do what's smart, not right.


421
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:42.659
Then let's go.
Leave town. Disappear.


422
01:03:42.826 --> 01:03:46.454
<i>I have disappeared.
Now I want my life back.</i>


423
01:03:49.875 --> 01:03:54.212
We have to face this.
What's it gonna be, Ray?


424
01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:05.283
Barry.

425
01:05:05.951 --> 01:05:09.579
Over there!

426
01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:39.818
Where the hell is he?

427
01:06:08.638 --> 01:06:12.017
Missy?

428
01:07:12.118 --> 01:07:16.206
Please.
Missy...


429
01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:22.170
Do you remember me
from the other day? The car trouble?


430
01:07:22.337 --> 01:07:24.464
What are you doing here?

431
01:08:04.004 --> 01:08:07.716
Please. We need to talk.

432
01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:12.095
I need to find
your brother's friend. Billy Blue.


433
01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:17.392
- Can you look through the yearbook?
- What's this all about?


434
01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:23.815
It has to do with your brother
and last July 4th.


435
01:08:23.982 --> 01:08:29.613
- What about it?
- What happened wasn't an accident.


436
01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:33.909
- I know.
- You know what?


437
01:08:34.075 --> 01:08:36.912
He killed himself.

438
01:08:38.497 --> 01:08:42.876
He went up there to die
where Susie died.


439
01:08:43.043 --> 01:08:47.506
The whole town blamed him
for her death.


440
01:08:47.672 --> 01:08:53.303
- So he blamed himself.
- How do you know it was suicide?


441
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:56.056
He left a note.

442
01:08:57.265 --> 01:09:03.438
I hid it from the insurance company.
They don't pay if it's suicide.


443
01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:12.489
That don't much matter anymore,
because the money's been spent.


444
01:09:12.656 --> 01:09:14.783
I WILL NEVER FORGET
LAST SUMMER


445
01:09:16.493 --> 01:09:20.789
This isn't a suicide note.
It's a death threat.


446
01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.294
- What are you talking about?
- Your brother didn't kill himself.


447
01:09:26.461 --> 01:09:31.341
I saw him. I was there and
whoever sent this was there too.


448
01:09:31.508 --> 01:09:35.887
- Where did you see him?
- We hit him. It was an accident.


449
01:09:36.596 --> 01:09:41.059
- My brother drowned.
- "Susie" was tattooed on his arm.


450
01:09:41.226 --> 01:09:45.814
He doesn't have a tattoo.
You didn't see anything. Get out!


451
01:09:48.733 --> 01:09:52.487
Get out of my house.

452
01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:02.664
Oh, my God...

453
01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:06.585
It wasn't your brother.

454
01:10:27.481 --> 01:10:34.988
- I'll be up in the balcony.
- He had a big, huge hook.


455
01:10:37.073 --> 01:10:42.662
Everything's going to be all right.
I won't let anything happen to you.


456
01:10:45.373 --> 01:10:47.709
Nicely done, ladies.

457
01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:52.589
Now, let's meet last year's winner:
Miss Helen Shivers.


458
01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:13.944
As we continue our pageant,
we move into the talent competition.


459
01:11:52.315 --> 01:11:55.360
Oh. Jesus.

460
01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.205
Barry!

461
01:12:12.419 --> 01:12:15.505
Somebody help him!

462
01:12:29.561 --> 01:12:32.230
Excuse me.

463
01:12:32.397 --> 01:12:37.277
- What's the problem?
- He's gonna kill him!


464
01:12:37.444 --> 01:12:41.031
- Up in the balcony.
- Everybody stay calm.


465
01:12:41.198 --> 01:12:44.659
Get off of me!

466
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.711
Stay behind me.

467
01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:09.184
Nobody's up here. This is not
my idea of a funny joke.


468
01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:14.105
The fisherman was here.
He killed Barry.


469
01:13:14.272 --> 01:13:19.194
There's nobody up here.
Let's go back downstairs.


470
01:13:24.241 --> 01:13:27.077
Watch your step.

471
01:13:27.244 --> 01:13:32.249
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, false alarm.
We'll resume in a few minutes.</i>


472
01:13:37.337 --> 01:13:42.551
I'm gonna take you home.
Your parents are worried about you.


473
01:13:42.717 --> 01:13:46.429
You have to believe me.

474
01:13:47.347 --> 01:13:50.809
Let me take you home.

475
01:13:53.728 --> 01:13:59.860
Excuse me.
We'll be needing this.


476
01:14:06.825 --> 01:14:09.369
Come on.

477
01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:14.082
So then he killed him
with a fish-hook.


478
01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:18.128
Did he use the same hook
to cut your hair off?


479
01:14:18.295 --> 01:14:22.966
No. He used a scissors. Asshole.

480
01:14:23.133 --> 01:14:26.845
I know I sound delusional.
But it's true.


481
01:14:27.012 --> 01:14:33.477
I heard the version with a mental
patient with a hook for a hand.


482
01:14:39.733 --> 01:14:43.695
We'll have to take the alley.

483
01:14:55.165 --> 01:14:59.586
Look.
You little shit-stick reject...


484
01:14:59.753 --> 01:15:04.132
There's been a murder. And
you'll fry in hell if you ignore it.


485
01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:09.304
I'll contact Barry's parents,
and we'll put out a search for him.


486
01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:14.184
He was probably
just playing a prank on you.


487
01:15:16.561 --> 01:15:23.235
Oh, Jesus. I'm just gonna see
if this fella needs help.


488
01:15:35.705 --> 01:15:38.083
It's him...

489
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:41.169
What's the trouble?

490
01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:45.215
That's him! Behind you!

491
01:15:45.382 --> 01:15:47.759
Behind you!

492
01:16:35.056 --> 01:16:38.435
"Susie Willis killed.
Trapped in car."


493
01:16:38.602 --> 01:16:43.398
"Survived by her father Benjamin,
a local fisherman."


494
01:17:04.711 --> 01:17:07.297
Elsa...

495
01:17:07.464 --> 01:17:12.385
Elsa!
Open the door!


496
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:20.602
Elsa, open the door!
Jesus Christ, hurry!


497
01:17:24.397 --> 01:17:28.860
What are you doing? Elsa!

498
01:17:29.027 --> 01:17:33.782
Jesus Christ, hurry!
Open the door!


499
01:17:35.534 --> 01:17:38.578
I'm coming.

500
01:17:42.123 --> 01:17:46.294
- The Broad Street entrance is open.
- I'm being attacked.


501
01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:49.005
You're what?

502
01:17:49.172 --> 01:17:55.053
Lock the other door.
I'll call the police. Do what I say!


503
01:18:46.104 --> 01:18:49.191
Elsa...

504
01:18:59.242 --> 01:19:02.245
Elsa?

505
01:19:04.289 --> 01:19:08.210
Elsa, where are you?

506
01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:05.780
Ray.

507
01:23:09.826 --> 01:23:12.412
Ray!

508
01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:22.047
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't David Egan we killed.


509
01:23:22.214 --> 01:23:24.382
It was Susie's father. Ben Willis.

510
01:23:24.549 --> 01:23:29.971
- But they found David's body.
- I think Willis killed David.


511
01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:36.937
- Then we killed Willis?
- But what if he didn't die?


512
01:23:38.605 --> 01:23:41.566
This is crazy.

513
01:23:41.733 --> 01:23:44.528
Come aboard.

514
01:23:44.694 --> 01:23:48.865
- We have to find Helen and Barry.
- We will.


515
01:24:02.295 --> 01:24:04.798
You...

516
01:24:05.757 --> 01:24:08.218
It's you.

517
01:24:08.385 --> 01:24:11.930
Billy Blue.
You went to Missy's.


518
01:24:12.097 --> 01:24:17.519
- You're the friend. The fisherman.
- I can explain. Julie, wait!


519
01:24:25.569 --> 01:24:28.738
- Wait.
- Stop it!


520
01:24:32.951 --> 01:24:37.080
- Please, help me.
- Easy, child.


521
01:24:37.247 --> 01:24:40.959
I need to call the police.

522
01:24:41.126 --> 01:24:44.921
On the boat! Hurry!

523
01:25:32.761 --> 01:25:36.181
Are you in some kind of trouble?

524
01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:41.478
Yes. I'm in a lot of trouble.

525
01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:50.403
That's a shame.
Being it's the 4th of July and all.


526
01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:56.076
Kids like you should be out
having fun. Drinking, partying, -


527
01:25:56.243 --> 01:26:01.581
- running people over, getting away
with murder, things like that.


528
01:26:04.167 --> 01:26:07.128
You...

529
01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:12.676
- Ben Willis.
- Good. You did your homework, too.


530
01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:54.820
Welcome aboard, Ray.

531
01:29:53.355 --> 01:29:57.484
Open the door, Julie.
You've got no place to hide.


532
01:32:10.075 --> 01:32:13.161
Come on. Julie.

533
01:32:25.423 --> 01:32:30.720
- Happy 4th of July, Julie.
- Please, it was an accident.


534
01:32:30.887 --> 01:32:35.851
When you leave a man for dead,
make sure he's really dead.


535
01:33:27.486 --> 01:33:32.407
We never killed anyone.
This whole year was for...


536
01:33:32.574 --> 01:33:37.787
The guilt was killing me.
I had to know who he was.


537
01:33:37.954 --> 01:33:40.665
That's why I went to see Missy.

538
01:33:40.832 --> 01:33:46.213
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but I wanted you back.


539
01:33:46.379 --> 01:33:50.675
I couldn't lose you again.

540
01:33:50.842 --> 01:33:56.765
I love you, Julie.
No one gets me the way you do.


541
01:33:57.808 --> 01:34:01.645
I understand your pain.

542
01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:14.241
Do you have any idea
why this man would want you dead?


543
01:34:15.033 --> 01:34:17.369
None.

544
01:34:17.536 --> 01:34:20.747
Here it comes.

545
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:36.763
Well, don't worry.

546
01:34:36.930 --> 01:34:42.227
The body will turn up.
They usually do.


547
01:34:50.402 --> 01:34:52.529
ONE YEAR LATER

548
01:34:52.696 --> 01:34:57.159
I made the dean's list.
Thank you very much.


549
01:34:57.325 --> 01:35:02.164
I miss you too, but I'll see you in
a couple of weeks. I love New York.


550
01:35:03.081 --> 01:35:08.003
Of course I love you more.
You know that.


551
01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:10.922
But I've got to take a shower.

552
01:35:11.089 --> 01:35:15.177
- Julie, you got some mail.
- Thanks. Deb.


553
01:35:18.054 --> 01:35:20.432
A towel.

554
01:35:20.599 --> 01:35:26.646
Don't start with me.
You can ravage me in two weeks.


555
01:35:26.813 --> 01:35:30.525
I love you too. Bye.

556
01:35:59.888 --> 01:36:02.390
POOL PARTY
THIS SATURDAY AT NOON


557
01:36:21.034 --> 01:36:27.833
I STILL KNOW
