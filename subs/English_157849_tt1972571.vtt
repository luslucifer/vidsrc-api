1
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.677
Yes.

2
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.153
I picked him up from the
airport this afternoon.


3
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.009
I know.

4
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.794
You know what I need?

5
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.729
Are you afraid, my friends?

6
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.231
Of us?

7
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.316
Of Islam?

8
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.489
People are suffering
throughout the Muslim world.


9
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.517
In Palestine, Afghanistan, Baghdad.

10
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.152
But do I believe terrorism

11
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.079
is the justifiable consequence
of this suffering?


12
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.609
No.

13
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.512
Violence against the innocent
is not the way of Allah.


14
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.369
My charities are set
up around the world


15
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.769
to stamp out poverty, as well
as promote religious tolerance


16
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.317
and understanding.

17
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.209
We rely on your generous
support to continue our work.


18
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.041
Thank you.

19
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.196
Yes, Maxi.

20
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.559
- Maxi? What have you got?
- Yeah?


21
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.889
Around 11:00 a.m.
police received a report


22
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.837
about a suspicious figure
in the central train station.


23
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.569
They were sent this image
taken from a mobile phone.


24
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.889
The quality's not great but
good enough to make a match.


25
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.880
Karpov, Issa.

26
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.995
Chechen, 26.

27
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.169
Classified as an escaped
militant jihadist.


28
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.369
- Hmm.
- Potentially violent.


29
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.609
Approach with caution.

30
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.089
Pull that down.

31
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.249
Security footage has him
returning to the station


32
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.569
five times during the day.

33
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.689
Do we know that guy?

34
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.129
Not yet. Working on it.

35
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.234
- Ah. Give me the hands.
- Uh..huh.


36
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.191
Some sort of note?

37
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.916
Currency maybe.

38
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.569
That's our last sight of him.

39
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.129
Who else knows he's out there?

40
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.889
The cops haven't made a connection.

41
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.609
Mmm. And upstairs?

42
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.049
Mmm..mmm, doesn't look like it.

43
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.729
If not yet they will soon.

44
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.609
Karl, Rasheed,
start with the mosques,


45
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.809
homeless shelters,
don't break anything.


46
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.120
Niki, try the railway station.

47
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.529
Find out who the hell
that scrawny bastard is.


48
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.609
Mmm..hmm.

49
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.271
Great.

50
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.156
Thank you.

51
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.360
Issa Karpov.

52
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.553
A Muslim first name and
a Russian last name.


53
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.769
What does that tell us?

54
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.489
That the boy is confused.

55
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.719
And no patronymic.

56
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.278
Is he the son of nobody?

57
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.329
Issa... Jesus no less.

58
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.152
Maybe he's the son of God
and he's come to save us.


59
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.116
Save me.

60
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.117
Doner plate.

61
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.151
Coffee, black.

62
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.209
Coffee, black.

63
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.569
- One euro.
- Cheers.


64
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.609
Salam.

65
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.441
Thank you.

66
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.957
Hmm.

67
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.809
Hello.

68
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.369
That scrawny bastard,
they call him the Admiral.


69
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.009
He's drinking at Silbersack Bar.

70
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.169
- I think you know the place?
- Ah.


71
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.479
Better than I should.

72
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.877
I'm looking at the receipts
from Abdullah's trip to Dubai.


73
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.009
Why make a four hour
layover, in Cyprus,


74
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.037
on your way back from
Dubai, to Frankfurt?


75
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.329
When you can fly direct?

76
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.449
I don't know, Günther. Air miles?

77
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.312
With my luck that's
probably all it is.


78
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.289
Oh, "Seven Friends".

79
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.929
Is that all you have, Günther?

80
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.529
Oh, I wish.

81
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.929
It's a shipping company
based in Cyprus.


82
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.649
Okay, I'll check it.

83
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.675
All right. Bye-bye.

84
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.190
Admiral.

85
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.996
Hmm.

86
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.150
Admiral.

87
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.929
Herr Dinkelmann.

88
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.034
Missing persons.

89
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.880
Strange boy.

90
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.529
Nervous.

91
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.036
He asked me to find someone for him.

92
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.081
A banker.

93
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.154
And this banker,

94
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.474
did he have a name?

95
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.915
You don't want it?

96
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.036
Brue.

97
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.609
Monsieur Tommy Brue.

98
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.271
Brue.

99
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.209
Word is Mohr is on to something.

100
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.409
His boys are hitting the streets.

101
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.116
Günther?

102
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.209
They found Karpov.

103
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.791
Hmm.

104
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.240
Ah, good.

105
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.070
Keep him walking.

106
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.489
Karpov, the Russian, he's ours.

107
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.594
Am I to understand you've found him?

108
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.849
I remind you that your license
to operate in Hamburg


109
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.569
is contingent on your
co-operation with my office.


110
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.515
I am co-operating, Dieter.

111
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:35.009
I want this kid to talk to
whoever he was told to talk to,


112
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.329
pray wherever he was told to pray,

113
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.609
sleep wherever he was told to sleep.

114
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.240
I don't want anybody else getting
close to him before we do.


115
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.476
And if this kid lets off a bomb?

116
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.751
It's in your hands, Günther.

117
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.169
Thank Christ it's not in yours

118
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.609
- because if it was you'd fuck it up.
- Mmm..hmm.


119
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.129
Then I want it in writing,
your signature on the letter,


120
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.049
because when the bomb
goes off in Hamburg


121
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.169
I want you there to see
the blood on the streets.


122
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.037
Have you ever seen
blood on the streets?


123
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.396
Clown.

124
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.809
Melik. We have a guest.

125
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.041
This is Issa, from Chechnya.

126
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.729
That's the kind of face I make.

127
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.049
Weddings.

128
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.889
Every time I attend one, I see another
good woman going to the wall.


129
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.358
Well, what about the man?

130
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.369
The man is the wall.

131
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.031
Oh.

132
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.929
The apartment belongs
to a Leyla Oktay.


133
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.876
Turkish national, 
German resident.

134
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.036
A widow.

135
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.049
One son, Melik.

136
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.489
Oh, Michael.

137
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.880
They have a citizenship
application pending.


138
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.249
Michael.

139
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.889
You've upset Dieter Mohr.

140
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.329
Really?

141
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.649
It probably has something to do

142
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.881
with the terrorists you're allowing
to walk the streets of Hamburg.


143
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.169
We're on a wait and see approach.

144
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.796
And what are we seeing?

145
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.609
Enough to keep waiting.

146
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.112
Don't underestimate Mohr.

147
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.639
He's got a lot of
friends here in Berlin.


148
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.809
Why don't you give him the Chechen?

149
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.329
Let him shine while you
stay focused on Abdullah.


150
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.569
I think he's moving the money
to a shipping company.


151
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.889
Are you sure?

152
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.119
Not yet, but close.

153
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.129
I need more time.

154
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.649
I'll do what I can, Günther,
but watch your back.


155
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.049
Word is the Americans
are taking an interest.


156
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.439
Thanks for the warning.

157
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.637
Whoo..hoo! Whoo!

158
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.601
Americans.

159
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.280
Günther Bachmann?

160
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.355
Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.

161
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.769
I know you by reputation, of course.

162
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.034
That can't be good.

163
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.049
Men with good reputations
usually aren't much use to me.


164
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.154
What about women?

165
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.689
This is my colleague Irna Frey.

166
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:15.769
- Hello.
- Hello.


167
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.591
She sails and spies.

168
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.715
I don't sail.

169
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.929
Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.

170
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.089
What are you doing here?

171
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.638
Me? I am just an observer.

172
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.649
I have been observed
by Americans before.


173
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.278
It usually doesn't end well.

174
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.209
From what I'm hearing,
we're not the ones


175
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.839
you need to be worrying about.

176
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.329
Good morning, everyone.

177
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.310
Herr Mohr has compiled a report.

178
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.689
Our investigations confirm

179
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.329
that Issa Karpov

180
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:55.313
is a member of a militant Salafi
group of Chechen jihadists.


181
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.329
Karpov was arrested
soon after the capture


182
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.849
of the group's leader
earlier this year.


183
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.956
Where did this information come from?

184
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.231
We have excellent resources inside
the Russian state security system.


185
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.489
After 24 hours of questioning,
Karpov confessed


186
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.169
to taking part in attacks
on gas pipelines,


187
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.449
transport, infrastructure,
police stations.


188
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.609
After 24 hours of Russian questioning

189
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.129
any one of us would
admit to anything.


190
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.609
Are you contesting this report?

191
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.441
No. Yes.

192
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.489
Maybe.

193
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.849
We've not yet had the
benefit of reading it.


194
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.689
The report concludes that the
terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg


195
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:42.849
seeking to make contact with
Islamist cells operating in the city.


196
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.049
They hide among us.

197
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.729
- Really?
- Yes.


198
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.049
Karpov is a wanted man.

199
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.489
If you have knowledge
of his whereabouts,


200
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.689
you are obliged to follow due
process under the constitution.


201
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.715
You mean arresting him?

202
00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:01.753
Issa Karpov is indeed seeking
to make contact in Hamburg,


203
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.449
with a banker.

204
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.249
We've had no briefing on this.

205
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.729
Well, if you were doing your job,
you wouldn't need one.


206
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.769
We're not policemen.

207
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.849
We're spies. Issa Karpov
may be of value to us.


208
00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.649
All I'm asking for is more time.

209
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.009
Our unit was set up to develop
intelligence resources


210
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.990
inside Germany's Islamic community.

211
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.834
- That's why we're here.
- Oh.


212
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.609
And I thought you were here
because you fucked up in Beirut


213
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.689
and your friend Michael
Axelrod had no idea...


214
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.329
This banker, do we know
what Karpov wants from him?


215
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.929
Not yet and if we
move against him now,


216
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.114
the chances are we never will.

217
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.249
I think he knows what
he's doing, Otto.


218
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.752
Maybe you should let
him get on with it.


219
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.209
You have 72 hours to bring

220
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.649
this matter to a resolution,

221
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:56.280
if not, we will, with or
without your co-operation.


222
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.600
- Okay?
- Okay.


223
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:08.649
Where should we go?

224
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.511
Meet at the place on the corner?

225
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.756
Okay.

226
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.969
Uh, I'll catch up with you later.

227
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.472
Okay, we'll see you there.

228
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.471
Melik?

229
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.914
Did we have an appointment?

230
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.649
Annabel Richter, Mama.

231
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.289
Hello, Leyla. How are you?

232
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.409
Welcome to our house, Frau Annabel.

233
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.089
Nice to see you again.

234
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.409
Come in. Come in please.

235
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.116
Thank you.

236
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:57.312
The boy is good, Frau Annabel.
Do you understand?


237
00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.093
If he has done something wrong,
it's because he had no...


238
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.329
Hello, Issa.

239
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.009
Uh, my name is Annabel Richter.

240
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.569
I am a lawyer.

241
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.358
I work with an organization
called Sanctuary North.


242
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.875
- Mmm, please?
- Okay.


243
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.598
Are you seeking asylum in Germany?

244
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.555
I make coffee.

245
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.369
There has to be a reason.

246
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.529
Either you cannot return
to your country of origin


247
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.889
because your life would be in danger

248
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.569
or you have been tortured.

249
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.151
Yes.

250
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.129
Yes, what?

251
00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.439
I have been tortured.

252
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.551
Forgive me, but this is my job.

253
00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:00.089
I want to believe you, but people
make this claim all the time.


254
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.921
I have to...

255
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.449
Who did this to you?

256
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.031
Roosskie.

257
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.471
I cannot help you unless
you are honest with me.


258
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.129
It's only a matter of time before the
German authorities will find you.


259
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.289
It's better for your case
if you go to them first.


260
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.270
- We can make a formal...
- I will never, never go back to Russia.


261
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.516
Please?

262
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.678
You will contact this man.

263
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.114
He will help me.

264
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.640
Mr. Thomas Brue.

265
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.089
Colonel Grigori Borisovich Karpov,

266
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.797
stationed in Chechnya, 1986.

267
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.399
He was involved with organized crime.

268
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.238
Big time. Drugs for arms.
White slave traffic.


269
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.649
You name it he was in to it.

270
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.675
Karpov died two years ago.

271
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.314
- And?
- He had a son.


272
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.649
Ivan.

273
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.039
Born, 1986 in Chechnya.

274
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.320
Mother unknown.

275
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.510
Good.

276
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.000
Fraulein Richter?

277
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.274
Please follow me.

278
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.790
Please.

279
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.529
What exactly is Sanctuary North?

280
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:12.889
I'm a lawyer.

281
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.889
Our clients are people who
have left their place of birth.


282
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.369
They are effectively stateless.

283
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.395
They are often traumatized.

284
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.569
What is it you want, Miss Richter?

285
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.117
A donation?

286
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.569
I'm sorry.

287
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.913
That was insensitive.

288
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.791
I'm here on behalf of a client.

289
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.512
His name is Issa Karpov.

290
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.809
Is the name known to you?

291
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.129
Karpov?

292
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:47.677
Mmm..mmm. No.

293
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.161
He is in possession of a letter
written by your father to his.


294
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.641
It makes reference
to a Mr. Lipizzaner,


295
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.249
as in the Spanish horses which are
born black but gradually turn white.


296
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.649
Yes.

297
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.915
This is a process I'm guessing
your bank is familiar with?


298
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.917
The letter contains a number.

299
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.129
Does it fit?

300
00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.609
Does it fit what?

301
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.489
Is the number an account
reference in use at this bank?


302
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:29.152
I'm afraid my bank doesn't broadcast the
manner in which it does its business.


303
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.278
I'm sure that suits
your clients very well.


304
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:37.889
But if this number does pertain
to an account held at this bank,


305
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.712
it would have been established
quite some time ago.


306
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.960
I will need to check our records.

307
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.969
Once I have done
so I will call you.

308
00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.209
When?

309
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.489
My client's situation in Hamburg
is extremely sensitive Mr. Brue.


310
00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.276
I'm sure.

311
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.835
He trusts you.

312
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:04.000
As, judging by the contents of
the letter, his father trusted yours.


313
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.190
Big boy.

314
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.831
Six...

315
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.390
Ah.

316
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.191
3448.

317
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.833
"Grigori Borisovich Karpov".

318
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.449
Sorry.

319
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.794
That's all right. 
I've given up.

320
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.798
Yeah? Good luck with that.

321
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.677
Yes?

322
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.276
Okay.

323
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.169
The Atlantic.

324
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.274
I'll be there.

325
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.278
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


326
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.969
Have something to drink?

327
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.729
Uh, glass of wine?

328
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.969
Uh, still water please.

329
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.313
Still water. Of course.

330
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.878
You frequent the Atlantic?

331
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.809
Uh...

332
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.960
Not your scene?

333
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:10.155
You said your client's situation
was sensitive, hence the hurry.


334
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.889
I can confirm that the
reference number you supplied


335
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.837
does pertain to an account
held at Brue Freres Bank.


336
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.037
Then he intends to make a claim.

337
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.761
Then tell him to bring
a large suitcase.


338
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.759
Of course he will need
to establish his identity.


339
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:35.929
My client entered the country
in difficult circumstances.


340
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.209
He has the letter.

341
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.889
- I will need to see it.
- Of course.


342
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.969
And in addition, he will need to
provide a certain instrument.


343
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.049
Which is?

344
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.129
I'm afraid I can't say,

345
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.529
but if your client is legitimate

346
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.289
he will know what I am talking about.

347
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.031
And if he has this instrument?

348
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.596
I see no difficulty in proceeding.

349
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.079
She's coming out.

350
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.849
Attractive.

351
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.761
Not my type.

352
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.609
What is your type, Günther?

353
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.192
You are, Irna. 
You know that.

354
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.633
Johannes
-Brahms
-Platz.

355
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.115
Hello, Tommy.

356
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.237
And you are?

357
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.759
My name is Bachmann.

358
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.278
I head an anti-terror unit

359
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:33.474
not many people know
about and even less like.


360
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.080
Let's walk.

361
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:17.849
Hamburg is one of the great
ports of the world, Tommy.


362
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.329
For centuries it opened its arms

363
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.039
to every foreigner who
washed up on its shores.


364
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.209
Now, since 9/11,

365
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.449
in the eyes of every dark-skinned man

366
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.049
we see someone who wants to kill us.

367
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.279
Problem is some of them do,

368
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:38.801
but the question is whether
Issa Karpov is one of them.


369
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.515
The lawyer.

370
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:44.809
Lawyer?

371
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.880
Annabel Richter.

372
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.401
The one you met at the hotel.
The one you'd like to fuck.


373
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.840
What? Not true?

374
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.449
You're too old for her,
Tommy. We both are.


375
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.329
See her, love her,
but you'll never get her,


376
00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.209
not even with all that black money

377
00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.489
you've got tucked away
in your bank vaults.


378
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:06.249
As far as I am aware,
Miss Richter represents


379
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:11.489
a client with a legitimate
financial interest with my bank.


380
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.449
Your bank does business
with the Russians, right?


381
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.089
It did. In my father's time.

382
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.591
Mafia?

383
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.794
Military mainly.

384
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.089
What's to stop me

385
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.639
from just walking away from this?

386
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.609
Whatever this is.

387
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:36.398
How about we start with
a full audit of your books?


388
00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:42.280
But your father wasn't
just a banker, Tommy.


389
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.729
He was a laundryman.

390
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:44.769
You're threatening me?

391
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.476
Just sympathizing.

392
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.632
You've been left to
clean up the mess.


393
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.871
We have a job to do, Tommy.

394
00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:12.569
You're going to help me do it.

395
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.729
Do what exactly?

396
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.689
Save Annabel Richter, for a start.

397
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.521
From what?

398
00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.319
From all of it.

399
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:57.769
Hmm. I wasn't expecting you.

400
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.089
No?

401
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.513
Who were you expecting?

402
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.236
Bad day?

403
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.720
A few surprises.

404
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.358
Enjoy your scotch, Tommy.

405
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.754
And try not to fall over
on your way to bed.


406
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.637
Issa, it is somebody for you.

407
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.169
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


408
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.249
Thank you for coming.

409
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.369
Of course.

410
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:22.671
Issa.

411
00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.150
This is Mr. Brue.

412
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.430
Morning.

413
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.470
Perhaps you could
show him the letter.


414
00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.759
"My dear Karpov,"

415
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.689
"as discussed,
please accept this letter"


416
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.889
"as assurance from
one friend to another,"


417
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:49.009
"that in the unfortunate
circumstance of your death"


418
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.729
"I should be pleased to
acquaint your own dear son,"


419
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.649
"Ivan Grigorevich Karpov,"

420
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:58.199
"with our friend Mr. Lipizzaner."

421
00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.089
"He need only present this letter,"

422
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.129
"together with the
necessary instrument"


423
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:05.474
"currently in your
possession for me to act."


424
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.089
"In case of my own death,"

425
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:13.754
"my son Thomas will fulfill
my promise to you."


426
00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:18.209
Forgive me. It's correct
signature of your father?


427
00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:19.871
It is.

428
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:24.329
Should I address you
then as Issa or Ivan?


429
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.649
Issa.

430
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.801
It's my Muslim name and I like.

431
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:31.831
But not the one your father gave you?

432
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.359
My mother was Chechen.

433
00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.409
I wish, sir, with your help,

434
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.329
to make an honorable life in Hamburg.

435
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.129
Very good,

436
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:45.874
but first, you understand there
are certain questions of fact.


437
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.672
I bring your attention to the
matter of the instrument.


438
00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:01.557
May I ask how you came to
be in possession of this?


439
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.438
It was given to me by
my father's lawyer.


440
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:09.040
So it seems I am being asked

441
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:12.649
to fulfill one father's
promise to another.


442
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.517
It's true. Karpov was my father.

443
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.314
You weren't close?

444
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.112
My father was a murderer.

445
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.209
He has Chechen blood on his hands.

446
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.680
And yet you seem willing
enough to take his money?


447
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.760
I understand you came
here from Turkey,


448
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.600
by an informal route, shall we say?

449
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:45.157
May I ask, what you
were doing in Turkey?


450
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.920
I was in prison.

451
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.600
And before that?

452
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.074
I was in prison in Russia.

453
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.809
- Why?
- You don't need to answer that, Issa.


454
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.209
Why not?

455
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.569
Because it is immaterial.

456
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.072
To what, Fraulein Richter?

457
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.249
Your client...

458
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.434
He's your client, too, Mr. Brue.

459
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.929
Your client lays claim

460
00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.609
to his father's account,

461
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:14.009
yet he has no passport,

462
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.769
cannot prove his identity.

463
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:19.114
He has the key and the letter,
what more do you want?


464
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:46.713
We couldn't hear
everything so well, Tommy.


465
00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:50.569
So exactly how much are we talking about?

466
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.649
I can't tell you.

467
00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.231
Not exactly.

468
00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.153
A ballpark figure?

469
00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:01.449
10,000, 100,000, 500,000?

470
00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:03.998
We're talking

471
00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.677
upwards of 10 million euro.

472
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.996
At least.

473
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.889
- Coffee.
- Yes, sir.


474
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.676
- Black.
- Right away.


475
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.929
I wasn't sure you'd come.

476
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.194
I want to make one thing clear.

477
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.676
I don't owe you anything.

478
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.318
What happened in Beirut?

479
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.249
You know what happened in Beirut.

480
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.639
My networks were blown.

481
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.878
So Hamburg is a punishment?

482
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.715
Depends on whether you like Hamburg.

483
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.271
Unless that's what you
want people to think?


484
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.409
Take some of the heat
off you so you can


485
00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.889
get on with the real game.

486
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.329
Which is?

487
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.594
Dr. Faisal Abdullah.

488
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.875
Come on, Günther, we probably
know as much about him as you do.


489
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.752
What do you know, Martha?

490
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.529
We know you've been
watching him for months,


491
00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.761
and we know you're under
pressure to get results.


492
00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:23.409
And we know that the man moves money

493
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:24.729
through a network of Muslim charities

494
00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.234
and every time he does,
some of it goes missing.


495
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.329
Dr. Faisal Abdullah is everything

496
00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.929
we want him to be
and a little bit more.


497
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:39.639
He's tolerant, enlightened,
engaged with the West.


498
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.958
But every good man has a
little bit of bad, doesn't he?


499
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.849
And in Abdullah's case,

500
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.397
that little bit

501
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:55.476
just might kill you.

502
00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:00.089
You know all that, how come he's
still walking the streets of Hamburg


503
00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.089
and not rotting in some
cell in Guantanamo?


504
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.729
Because we think, we don't know.

505
00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:09.801
The money leaves and we
don't know where it goes.


506
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.969
Anyways, on German soil he's got
the protection of German law.


507
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:16.449
That hasn't stopped you before.

508
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:18.329
We don't do that anymore.

509
00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:20.249
You want us to do it, then.

510
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.869
I'm more interested in knowing
why you haven't done it already?


511
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.592
Please work with us
on this one, Günther.


512
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:30.960
I don't trust you.

513
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.474
Old habits die hard.

514
00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:38.477
That's what I'm worried about.

515
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.318
I was talking about yours.

516
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:45.969
Have a nice day.

517
00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:47.471
You too.

518
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.514
I got your text.

519
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.477
I...

520
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.358
I can't do this anymore.

521
00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:23.321
Someone's going to find out.
I can feel it.


522
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.475
I'm frightened.

523
00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.929
They are looking at me.

524
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.875
All of them.

525
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.679
I'm done. It's over.

526
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.556
I am not your spy. 
I am a student.

527
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.809
You cannot make me do this.

528
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.836
I never made you do anything, Jamal.

529
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.279
And I never will.

530
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.520
You know that.

531
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.234
When we first met,

532
00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.472
you remember what we talked about?

533
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:08.234
You remember that?

534
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.151
Family, the future.

535
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:17.233
Most of us don't get
to choose, but you did.


536
00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.752
You made the right choice.

537
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.835
It's not easy.

538
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.558
But there's no going back,

539
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.400
for any of us.

540
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.318
We can't undo what's done.

541
00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.801
Look at me.

542
00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.729
Look at me.

543
00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.561
Come here.

544
00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:02.273
You're my ears, Jamal,
and my eyes. I need you.


545
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.193
You're important to me.

546
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.951
Good.

547
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.355
- Hello?
- Tommy?


548
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:50.631
Yes.

549
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:54.120
You need to give Issa
Karpov what he wants.


550
00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:15.874
Uh, Miss Richter?

551
00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.729
Can we talk?

552
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.881
Perhaps we could go for a tea?

553
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.834
What do you want?

554
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.369
I've reconsidered
your client's position.


555
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:34.794
My bank is prepared
to honor his claim.


556
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.838
Why have you changed your mind?

557
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.958
Perhaps you convinced me.

558
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:46.640
I thought you'd be pleased.

559
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.236
Okay.

560
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.677
I'll be in touch.

561
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.476
Annabel?

562
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.639
We should take care.

563
00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:06.876
All of us.

564
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:39.169
It is our religious
obligation to give.


565
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.129
This is the holy practice of Zakat,

566
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.359
one of the five pillars of Islam.

567
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:48.009
Through our adherence
to this practice of charity,


568
00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:50.049
we are drawn nearer to God.

569
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.279
Günther, the banker called.
He did it.


570
00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:54.111
Good.

571
00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.515
Issa! Issa!

572
00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:00.009
Wake up.

573
00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:05.520
Where will you take him?

574
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.397
It's better if you don't know.

575
00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.289
We have to go.

576
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:14.033
It's not safe to stay here.
For you or for them.


577
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.049
There are clothes in here.

578
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.558
There's also some
scissors and a razor.


579
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.394
Issa, they know what you look like.

580
00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.076
Come on, Issa.

581
00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.037
They're moving.

582
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.234
Where are we going?

583
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:53.729
My brother Florien has an
apartment that's being renovated.


584
00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:56.995
He's arranged for them
to stop work for a week.


585
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:13.672
Where's the next station?

586
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.271
Okay.

587
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:28.234
We get out at the next stop.

588
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:31.556
We have to find another taxi, okay?

589
00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:00.609
Hey.

590
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:02.919
You're blocking the street!

591
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.556
Hey.

592
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.471
Oh, fuck!

593
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:06.951
Hello?

594
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:10.671
Hello?

595
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.489
Against the wall!

596
00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.009
Check the other rooms!

597
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:18.089
Ow! Stop!

598
00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.649
Bedroom clear.

599
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:39.751
We're nearly there.

600
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.194
I wish to talk to Mr. Brue.

601
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:30.152
I spoke with him earlier tonight.

602
00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.169
Issa, he says the bank
will honor your claim.


603
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.638
I do not want the money.

604
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:39.409
What?

605
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:42.754
Father's money is bad money.

606
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.114
But without it you have nothing.

607
00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.191
I have God.

608
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.119
I brought you some food.

609
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.640
There's a sleeping bag
and some more clothes.


610
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:12.599
I'll be back first thing in the morning.

611
00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:18.954
It is not a prison.

612
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:36.161
This was the best you could do, huh?

613
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.755
I am a cave dweller.

614
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:42.117
I'll leave the rooms
with a view to you.


615
00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.478
You let Mohr off the leash?

616
00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:51.952
He doesn't need me to give
him a reason to piss you off.


617
00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.831
You've lost Karpov, haven't you?

618
00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:03.717
I need the lawyer to move freely.

619
00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:09.249
I don't have that kind
of influence, Günther.


620
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:12.929
We both know you have all the
influence you choose to have.


621
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:16.169
Look, if you want me to help you
on your way, you've got to tell me.


622
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:18.320
Tell me which way you're heading.

623
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:25.710
Last month a cargo ship left Cyprus.

624
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:31.400
It was carrying 1,000 tons of
donated grain bound for Djibouti.


625
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:36.400
It stopped to re-fuel on
the south coast of Yemen.


626
00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:41.751
When it reached its destination
there were 900 tons left.


627
00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:44.997
At the same time 100 tons of grain

628
00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:48.912
mysteriously hit the open
market in the Yemen.


629
00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:53.729
The money from its sale was
used to buy rocket launchers


630
00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:55.994
for Islamist militants.

631
00:59:56.210 --> 01:00:00.874
I think the shipping company
is an al-Qaeda front.


632
01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:04.209
I think that's where
the missing funds


633
01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.553
from Abdullah's charities are going.

634
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:09.713
You think, or you know?

635
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.249
Come on, Günther. Share.

636
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.878
Abdullah's not the bad guy.

637
01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:19.038
He's our way to the bad guy.

638
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:22.769
A man supplies money that buys
weapons that kills Americans


639
01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:24.169
and you're telling me he's a pal?

640
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.369
So maybe he's not waving the
flag of freedom and democracy


641
01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:28.929
as enthusiastically as you'd like.

642
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:30.409
Okay.

643
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:31.929
- But he sees his people...
- Spare the lecture.


644
01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.729
He sees his people being fucked
over from here to eternity.


645
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:35.849
I've heard that before, so...

646
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:40.929
Maybe a little bit of him
wants to return the favor,


647
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:44.649
but it's that little bit
that makes him so valuable.


648
01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.151
Don't you see?

649
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:49.849
Okay. I understand. But that's
not what my people would say.


650
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:53.049
What would your people say?
Take him out? Kill him?


651
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:54.689
And then what have you got?

652
01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:58.209
A great big fucking hole,
and who's going to fill it?


653
01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:00.997
Nobody knows. You least of all.

654
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:05.129
So we all start looking again,

655
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:07.394
and tap-tapping around in the dark.

656
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:15.009
You want to own Abdullah,
is that what you want?


657
01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:18.514
A man with your reputation
and your resources.


658
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:21.837
How are you going to do that?

659
01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:26.121
Karpov has access to money.

660
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:29.969
That may be of interest to Abdullah.

661
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:31.689
And the lawyer?

662
01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:33.289
He trusts her.

663
01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:43.921
It's okay.

664
01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.515
It's okay?

665
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:55.556
Dance.

666
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.489
- Trying to impress me, Günther?
- No.


667
01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:03.449
Listen, I'll put Mohr
back on the leash,


668
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.679
but now you owe me.

669
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.609
Hey, Annabel.

670
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:08.397
Good to see you. How's Ursula?

671
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:10.809
No, no.

672
01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.636
Let go. Let go of me!

673
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:28.997
Yes?

674
01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.089
Okay?

675
01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:12.274
- Yeah. Good.
- Yeah.


676
01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.876
- Rasheed?
- Mmm..hmm?


677
01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:22.809
You can't do this. I'm a lawyer.

678
01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:23.929
This is criminal.

679
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:25.955
Sit the fuck down.

680
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.196
Lawyer?

681
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:31.351
You're a fucking social
worker for terrorists.


682
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:34.178
Cigarette?

683
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.991
That's right, you've given up.

684
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.395
Is that it?

685
01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:50.193
Is that all the fight
you're going to give me?


686
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:53.841
Pacifist.

687
01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:00.154
We know about you.

688
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:06.409
Left-wing lawyer.

689
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:08.369
Wealthy family.

690
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:10.520
Father's a judge.

691
01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:15.035
Everything you do says
"fuck you" to him.


692
01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:23.718
Is that the best you can do?

693
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:26.475
Can I go now?

694
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.270
Go where?

695
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:35.110
Go where?

696
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:42.529
Hmm?

697
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:46.512
Back to your self-righteous
friends at Sanctuary North?


698
01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:52.312
But no one's going to saw
off their heads, are they?


699
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:57.249
Nobody's going to blow up their kids

700
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.289
because you're on a beach in Bali

701
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:02.919
or riding a train to school
in Madrid or London.


702
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:05.009
How fucking dare you?

703
01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:06.369
How fucking dare me?

704
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:10.272
Tell me I've broken
every rule in the book?


705
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:14.954
That I've trampled on the
essence of the constitution?


706
01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.592
You want to spout that crap?

707
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:25.111
Yes?

708
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:28.998
Do you know where you are?

709
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:31.849
No, you don't.

710
01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:34.671
This is the real world, Annabel.

711
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:41.474
We are fighting against the radical
off cuts of a nation called Islam.


712
01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:43.609
You've crossed the line.

713
01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:46.112
You're on their side now.

714
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.849
Hello.

715
01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:44.040
I don't care what you do to me.

716
01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:47.714
But you're not the one we're
talking about, are you, dear?


717
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:53.038
Issa must be worried sick.

718
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.398
Wherever you've hidden him,

719
01:07:56.970 --> 01:08:00.713
he's probably wondering if
you're ever coming back.


720
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.756
I hope he doesn't
do anything foolish.


721
01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:12.840
Come, sit with me.

722
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:16.550
Come on.

723
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:22.049
There are people out there
who want to arrest him.


724
01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:24.449
You know that of course.

725
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:28.318
We're concerned that they
will find him before we do.


726
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:31.994
There is a difference
between them and us.


727
01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:36.119
They want to hurt him.

728
01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:39.719
We want to help him.

729
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:46.569
You see, Annabel,
we're not your enemy.


730
01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:48.834
We're your solution.

731
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.591
Good.

732
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.231
You know what my guys told me?

733
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.276
When they pulled you off the street?

734
01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:01.198
You didn't put up a fight.

735
01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.795
Not really.

736
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.609
You struggled a bit.

737
01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:07.874
Screamed a little, but

738
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.753
you let them take you.

739
01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:19.919
It's almost as if you
wanted it to happen.


740
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:25.849
You needed someone to
take it out of your hands


741
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:29.274
because you are out of
your depth, Annabel.


742
01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:35.240
You know you can't save him,

743
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:37.914
not on your own.

744
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:45.872
Your choice is between us

745
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.675
and nobody.

746
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.873
The clock is ticking.

747
01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:00.194
You know they'll find him,
and when they do,


748
01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:04.569
he'll be on the first
plane back to Russia,


749
01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.277
unless the Americans want him

750
01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:11.153
and then we won't know
where he is and nor will he.


751
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.718
He doesn't want the money.

752
01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:18.438
He just doesn't want it.

753
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:24.280
Half radical, half

754
01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:26.649
rich kid.

755
01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:29.756
Half Russian, half Chechen.

756
01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:33.596
Loves his mother, hates his father.

757
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:38.195
You and I both know Issa Karpov
has no idea what he wants.


758
01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:41.809
There is something else

759
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:44.597
you and I both know, don't we?

760
01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:50.591
We both know he's innocent.

761
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.119
So what do you want?

762
01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:15.519
I want to help him.

763
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.676
Issa?

764
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.369
Issa, I'm sorry.

765
01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:58.360
I had a dream.

766
01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:02.911
They took you. 
They tortured you.

767
01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:13.561
And what happened?

768
01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:18.634
Did I tell them where you were?

769
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:20.169
No.

770
01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:22.209
You are stronger than I was.

771
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:24.599
You tell them nothing.

772
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.769
Go and put on something warm.

773
01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:31.272
I want to show you something outside.

774
01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:24.031
Okay.

775
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:31.831
Right.

776
01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:36.921
Look at him.

777
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:40.115
He's safe.

778
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:44.369
There's a bed for you here.

779
01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:46.489
It's better that you don't go home.

780
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:49.118
Herr Mohr and his boys
are still out looking for you.


781
01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:55.769
Are you trying to get me drunk?

782
01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:57.396
Yes.

783
01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:00.434
How's Karpov?

784
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:02.515
Getting there.

785
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:05.075
And the lawyer?

786
01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:12.875
I already got you all
the time I can get.


787
01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:18.755
Beirut was our mistake.

788
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:22.274
One of our agents

789
01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:26.877
blew your network and I know
you shared. We messed up.


790
01:17:28.450 --> 01:17:31.556
Just thought you needed to know that.

791
01:17:32.650 --> 01:17:35.357
We make that kind of mistake.

792
01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:41.129
I can understand why
you don't trust us.


793
01:17:41.130 --> 01:17:44.634
Your agents and contacts
were compromised.


794
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:49.809
Men who trusted you died,

795
01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:52.631
and that stays with you always.

796
01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:56.674
And all that damage

797
01:17:57.690 --> 01:17:59.794
we leave behind.

798
01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:09.360
All those lives,

799
01:18:11.170 --> 01:18:13.559
all those empty rooms,

800
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:16.951
what would they have been for?

801
01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:21.276
You ever ask yourself that question?

802
01:18:23.010 --> 01:18:24.841
Why we do what we do?

803
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:27.849
Mmm..hmm, sometimes.

804
01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:29.969
But I always come back
to the same answer.


805
01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:31.995
And what is it?

806
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:35.757
Make the world a safer place.

807
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:39.511
Isn't that enough?

808
01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:09.035
- Mmm..mmm.
- Mmm...


809
01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:11.597
Move your queen.

810
01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:15.209
Just because you're Russian,

811
01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:19.032
doesn't mean you're a better
chess player than me.


812
01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:22.081
I'm Chechen.

813
01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:26.517
Okay, so you're good at chess.

814
01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:30.395
Tell me something
else about yourself.


815
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.231
You said your mother is Chechen?

816
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.391
She's dead.

817
01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:42.675
I'm sorry.

818
01:19:44.410 --> 01:19:46.719
My father raped her.

819
01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:50.409
She died when I was born.

820
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:56.875
She was 15.

821
01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.161
It was my mother's.

822
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:13.680
It's beautiful.

823
01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:14.275
You must go.

824
01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:43.235
You can push him a bit more.

825
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:46.752
Try to get him emotional.

826
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:51.394
If it happens naturally,
lose your temper.


827
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:58.729
But he doesn't want the money.

828
01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:00.391
I know.

829
01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:04.074
But he wants you.

830
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:31.089
Günther?

831
01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:32.809
You should take care.

832
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:35.517
Maybe we're pushing too hard.

833
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:39.078
Don't go soft on me, Irna.

834
01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:41.433
There's no room for that on this one.

835
01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:45.238
Tell me one where there was.

836
01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:09.796
Morning.

837
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:29.317
Seventy people died in a
market in Baghdad yesterday.


838
01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:41.310
Insha Allah.

839
01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.115
God's will?

840
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:52.809
Or just a man who was arrogant
enough to kill in his name?


841
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:54.436
She's good.

842
01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:58.990
Leyla and Melik have been arrested.

843
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:01.529
They may be deported,

844
01:24:01.530 --> 01:24:03.369
because they were kind to you,

845
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.872
because they invited
you in to their home.


846
01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:09.289
Explain it to me, Issa!

847
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:11.201
God's will?

848
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:13.409
Explain to me why that man who killed

849
01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:15.369
those women and children in Baghdad

850
01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:17.369
is any different from
your own father?


851
01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:19.089
I came to Hamburg
to make a new life.

852
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:22.849
No. You came to Hamburg
to find Mr. Tommy Brue.


853
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:24.689
You came to claim
your father's money.


854
01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:28.080
I told you, I
do not want his money.

855
01:24:28.650 --> 01:24:30.276
Hmm.

856
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:42.715
Forgive me.

857
01:24:58.890 --> 01:25:00.471
Maybe

858
01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:06.997
there's a way to leave
your past behind, Issa.


859
01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:13.089
- Take your father's money...
- Take your father's money,


860
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:17.276
- and turn it into something good.
- ...and turn it into something good.


861
01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:51.319
Your goat is tethered.

862
01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:26.529
It's just an ordinary pen.

863
01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:30.751
Looks like a pen, writes like
a pen and listens like a pen.


864
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:33.449
Take it apart, it's still a pen.

865
01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:35.440
Are you clear?

866
01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:37.169
- Are you clear?
- Mmm..hmm.


867
01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:39.689
You are acting on behalf of
a wealthy Muslim client.


868
01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:40.769
We've been over this.

869
01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:42.169
You are acting on behalf
of a wealthy Muslim...


870
01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:43.369
Several times.

871
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:45.369
...who has come in to a
considerable inheritance


872
01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:47.649
and the source of the
money is questionable.


873
01:26:47.650 --> 01:26:48.929
He seeks to distribute these funds

874
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:50.129
in a spiritually correct manner.

875
01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:52.314
For Christ's sake!

876
01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:56.191
I'm not doing this for you.

877
01:26:56.770 --> 01:26:59.034
Whatever it takes, Tommy.

878
01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:58.311
Hello.

879
01:28:00.010 --> 01:28:01.716
Put your arms up.

880
01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:07.637
Bag?

881
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:22.169
Hi.

882
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:25.409
- Hi.
- Hello.


883
01:28:25.410 --> 01:28:26.489
- Mr. Brue?
- Yes.


884
01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:27.609
- Welcome.
- Thank you.


885
01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:28.689
I'm Jamal.

886
01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:30.089
My father is expecting you.

887
01:28:30.090 --> 01:28:31.889
- Can you take off your shoes?
- Of course.


888
01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:34.119
I'll take care of the coat.

889
01:28:40.930 --> 01:28:42.449
Mr. Brue.

890
01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.714
- Mr. Brue.
- An honor.


891
01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:51.289
You have met my son Jamal?

892
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:54.714
Yes, and, uh, another
at the door, I believe.


893
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:57.281
Please sit.

894
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.716
Please.

895
01:29:07.450 --> 01:29:09.169
As explained to you,

896
01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:12.409
my client's situation
in Germany is delicate.


897
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:15.390
These are the details of his offer.

898
01:29:17.170 --> 01:29:19.569
As you can see,
there are specific requests


899
01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:21.889
for some money to
be sent to Chechnya.


900
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:24.677
Hospitals and schools.

901
01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:28.849
Perhaps this is a joke?

902
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:31.751
You have added a zero to test me.

903
01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:34.519
The figure is correct.

904
01:29:51.370 --> 01:29:54.316
Where did this money come from?

905
01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:56.289
It has come to him

906
01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:58.872
in the form of an inheritance.

907
01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:02.369
My client has come to
regard it as unclean


908
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:05.129
and seeks your guidance
in disposing of it


909
01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:07.553
in a manner befitting your religion.

910
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:15.809
You're an honorable man,
I believe that.


911
01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:19.359
But tell me, why should I trust you?

912
01:30:19.530 --> 01:30:21.889
We must trust each other surely.

913
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:25.329
I am willing,
under my client's instruction,


914
01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:27.529
to arrange for significant funds

915
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:29.395
to be transferred to you.

916
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:32.209
You are known as a religious man.

917
01:30:32.210 --> 01:30:34.009
A trusted man.

918
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:37.689
I accept you will direct this money

919
01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:40.033
to the purpose he intends.

920
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:41.991
Why this urgency?

921
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:46.596
My client's legal status
in Germany is insecure.


922
01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:50.234
I would recommend you
accept this gift now,


923
01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:53.649
because he may not be in a position

924
01:30:53.650 --> 01:30:55.390
to offer it much longer.

925
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:56.275
Mr. Brue.

926
01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:06.196
- Here.
- Thanks.


927
01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:12.039
Doctor, this way, please.

928
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:25.009
Dr. Abdullah, may I introduce

929
01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:27.169
your benefactor, Issa Karpov,

930
01:32:27.170 --> 01:32:30.674
and his lawyer, Miss Richter.

931
01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:36.929
I wish to speak with Issa alone.

932
01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:38.729
Of course.

933
01:32:38.730 --> 01:32:40.675
Miss Richter?

934
01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.916
Please tell me,

935
01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:52.489
why you have decided

936
01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:54.879
to make this generous gift?

937
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:57.832
Are you under duress?

938
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:59.169
No.

939
01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:00.569
Look at me.

940
01:33:00.570 --> 01:33:03.277
It is unclean money, sir.

941
01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:09.609
It belongs to a man who
has done great evil.


942
01:33:10.770 --> 01:33:12.601
My father.

943
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:15.832
I wish to be free of him.

944
01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:19.049
Whose sins do you renounce

945
01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:20.729
by making this gift?

946
01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:23.232
The sins of my father.

947
01:33:23.610 --> 01:33:25.794
And your own sins?

948
01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:34.072
I believe you feel lost,

949
01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:36.719
without God or love.

950
01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:40.911
You must choose the path of Allah.

951
01:33:41.210 --> 01:33:45.795
Only then will you be truly
free of this burden.


952
01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:04.489
I am satisfied, Mr. Brue,
that his offer is genuine.


953
01:34:04.490 --> 01:34:06.321
Wonderful.

954
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:13.689
This is a list of charities,
with their banking details,


955
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:15.430
for your verification.

956
01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:17.550
Please.

957
01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:33.520
It seems in order.

958
01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:38.316
I will await further instruction.

959
01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:00.889
Michael.

960
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:03.040
Welcome to Berlin.

961
01:35:04.450 --> 01:35:06.809
Everyone got my report?

962
01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:08.471
Yes.

963
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:11.169
You need to concentrate on Burgdorf,

964
01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:13.274
Ministry of the Interior.

965
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:15.769
The final decision will be his.

966
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:19.969
I'm going to need passports
for Karpov and the Turks.


967
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:21.329
We don't do passports.

968
01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:22.729
He gave the lawyer his word.

969
01:35:22.730 --> 01:35:26.871
I did, and this time I want
it to mean something.


970
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:55.400
It's up there.

971
01:36:14.170 --> 01:36:15.889
We've checked every
name on the charity list.


972
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:18.074
They're all clean.

973
01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:23.433
Herr Bachmann, please.

974
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:29.471
You're looking at me, at us,

975
01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:31.929
but we don't exist,

976
01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:34.353
not legally, not officially,

977
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:39.289
because German intelligence
needs a job to be done


978
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:41.609
that German law won't let it do,

979
01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:46.001
so me and my people we stay small.

980
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:48.249
We stay on the streets.

981
01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:50.559
We make the weather.

982
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.957
Our sources don't come
to us, we find them.


983
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:58.640
Uh, we become their friends.

984
01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:01.529
Their brothers, their fathers,

985
01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:04.158
their lovers, if we have to.

986
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:07.729
When they're ours, and only then,

987
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:10.369
we direct them at bigger targets.

988
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:13.449
It takes a minnow to
catch a barracuda.


989
01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:15.449
A barracuda to catch a shark.

990
01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:17.369
I don't fish, Herr Bachmann.

991
01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:18.969
It's a metaphor, Erhardt.

992
01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:20.289
Just a metaphor.

993
01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:22.689
We take our time.

994
01:37:22.690 --> 01:37:25.158
We watch. We wait.

995
01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:28.049
We see what Allah provides.

996
01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:31.049
Uh, well, this time
Allah has provided


997
01:37:31.050 --> 01:37:34.599
Issa Karpov and his
ill-gotten millions.


998
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:40.129
As you can see from the
report my team has compiled,


999
01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:46.329
Dr. Abdullah has provided an
extensive list of his favorite charities


1000
01:37:46.330 --> 01:37:49.515
to be the recipients
of those millions.


1001
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:53.833
Each one of those charities
has been CIA cleared.


1002
01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:56.689
It is my belief he will replace

1003
01:37:56.690 --> 01:37:59.670
one of the names on
this list with another.


1004
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:03.329
Seven Friends Navigation Company.

1005
01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:07.169
What kind of proof can you show us?

1006
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:09.209
Proof is what we're looking for.

1007
01:38:09.210 --> 01:38:11.553
If this Abdullah,

1008
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:16.636
if this barracuda, if I've
understood the metaphor,


1009
01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:19.009
takes the bait,

1010
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:22.320
with what leverage will you
secure his cooperation?


1011
01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:25.089
On the negative, uh,

1012
01:38:25.090 --> 01:38:27.911
threat of prosecution, prison,

1013
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:32.209
uh, public humiliation,
discrediting of his charities,


1014
01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:35.329
um, deportation of
his wife and children.


1015
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:38.515
I choose the positive.

1016
01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:44.358
Amnesty, citizenship, for which he
has applied half a dozen times.


1017
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:48.040
Now we are offering citizenship
to financiers of terror?


1018
01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:51.874
You are all familiar with
the operational plan?


1019
01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:55.889
We have three hours to apprehend
Abdullah and make him ours


1020
01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:58.929
and get him back home
before anyone notices.


1021
01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:00.849
And if he does not comply?

1022
01:39:00.850 --> 01:39:01.969
Then he's yours.

1023
01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:04.369
Do with him whatever you need to do.

1024
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:06.649
And Issa Karpov?

1025
01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:08.289
He's to be left alone.

1026
01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:11.329
In my eyes it's unacceptable.

1027
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:13.969
Find someone else to
parade before the cameras.


1028
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:15.569
That was agreed.

1029
01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:17.569
He has our protection.

1030
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:20.516
Martha, what is the
American perspective?


1031
01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:24.049
Maybe if you could define for us

1032
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:27.793
what you think the long-term
objective would be.


1033
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:31.039
What are we trying to achieve?

1034
01:39:34.450 --> 01:39:36.679
To make the world a safer place.

1035
01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:43.954
Isn't that enough?

1036
01:39:54.970 --> 01:39:56.801
Mr. Brue?

1037
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:59.440
Tomorrow morning.

1038
01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:02.317
Thank you for letting me know.

1039
01:40:15.730 --> 01:40:17.800
How are you feeling?

1040
01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:19.671
Good.

1041
01:40:22.210 --> 01:40:25.953
You drop him at the bank
and then you disappear.


1042
01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:29.240
Do you understand?

1043
01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:33.837
You are forcing me to
betray my own father.


1044
01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:38.359
You are not betraying him.
You are saving him.


1045
01:40:38.890 --> 01:40:40.880
That is an act of love.

1046
01:42:57.690 --> 01:43:00.192
He's been granted asylum.

1047
01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:04.118
It was the best I could do.

1048
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:14.875
I gave you Issa.

1049
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:17.998
Issa gives you Abdullah.

1050
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:19.916
What's next?

1051
01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:22.169
What will you do to him?

1052
01:43:22.170 --> 01:43:23.249
To Abdullah?

1053
01:43:23.250 --> 01:43:24.797
Yes.

1054
01:43:26.010 --> 01:43:27.875
Nothing bad.

1055
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:29.591
I promise.

1056
01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:03.711
Look.

1057
01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:07.314
What does this mean?

1058
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:11.520
It means you can stay.

1059
01:44:33.210 --> 01:44:35.712
I have something for you.

1060
01:45:35.490 --> 01:45:37.958
- Doctor.
- Hello, Mr. Brue.


1061
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:29.009
This confirms the receipt of funds

1062
01:46:29.010 --> 01:46:30.969
from Mr. Karpov

1063
01:46:30.970 --> 01:46:34.849
in to your new account
we've set up here.


1064
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:40.356
These are the charities you
specified with their bank details.


1065
01:46:43.210 --> 01:46:47.840
Each of the transfers is logged in
to our system and is ready to go.


1066
01:46:48.210 --> 01:46:49.289
Oh.

1067
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:52.555
Would you please
check all the details?


1068
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:55.209
The name of the account holders

1069
01:46:55.210 --> 01:46:57.449
and the money assigned
to each recipient


1070
01:46:57.450 --> 01:47:01.272
and then authorize each
one with your signature.


1071
01:47:54.690 --> 01:47:56.769
I would like to make a substitute.

1072
01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:59.238
I need to change a name.

1073
01:47:59.330 --> 01:48:01.849
Seven Friends Navigation Company?

1074
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:02.969
Yes.

1075
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:05.289
It is a shipping company,

1076
01:48:05.290 --> 01:48:08.270
but one whose business is charity.

1077
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:11.569
We can have all
the aid in the world

1078
01:48:11.570 --> 01:48:16.120
but it's worthless unless you can
get it to the people who need it.


1079
01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:17.449
Mmm..hmm.

1080
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:18.997
Yes.

1081
01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:21.917
All right.

1082
01:48:47.970 --> 01:48:51.121
Your final signature.

1083
01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:53.711
Ah!

1084
01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:25.289
Thank you very much.

1085
01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:27.121
Excuse me.

1086
01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:58.079
Unfortunately my son is delayed.

1087
01:49:58.410 --> 01:50:00.689
Allow us to call you a taxi.

1088
01:50:00.690 --> 01:50:02.919
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.


1089
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:04.431
Right.

1090
01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:16.751
Yes.

1091
01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:19.798
Taxi for Brue Freres.

1092
01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:05.315
A pleasure.

1093
01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:10.521
As-salam.

1094
01:51:15.130 --> 01:51:17.314
My direction, Blankenese.

1095
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:28.249
Ahhh!

1096
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:29.990
Stay back!

1097
01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:32.711
Wait.

1098
01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:35.049
Stop! What are you doing?

1099
01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:36.790
- Wait.
- No!


1100
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:39.449
No.

1101
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:41.129
Issa!

1102
01:51:41.130 --> 01:51:42.369
- What's going on?
- No!


1103
01:51:42.370 --> 01:51:43.996
No!

1104
01:51:44.010 --> 01:51:45.249
Stand up.

1105
01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:46.831
No!

1106
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:51.116
No!

1107
01:51:51.170 --> 01:51:52.649
Issa, no!

1108
01:51:52.650 --> 01:51:54.889
Stop it! No!

1109
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:56.529
No, Issa!

1110
01:52:24.930 --> 01:52:26.689
Fuck!

1111
01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:35.369
Fuck!

1112
01:55:53.050 --> 01:55:55.550
