1
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.552
Jesus!

2
00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:19.749
Asshole!

3
00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:21.757
Man, did you see that?

4
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.921
I mean, he pulled right
out in front of me.


5
00:03:24.863 --> 00:03:27.559
Took my eyes off the road for
a second, but I mean, come on.


6
00:03:29.468 --> 00:03:31.095
Maybe it's time we take a little break.

7
00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:33.074
Yeah.

8
00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.539
Pull over the next chance we get.

9
00:04:15.947 --> 00:04:16.675
Nice car.

10
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.112
Thanks.

11
00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:24.016
You got your air... CD...

12
00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:26.853
Leather.

13
00:04:30.862 --> 00:04:33.126
Looks to me like you sprung
for the whole nine yards.


14
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:34.994
Yeah. I guess so.

15
00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:38.739
But err... 'spose that rig
of yours there is what you...


16
00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.739
really need out here, huh?

17
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.603
Why would you want
a piece of shit like that...


18
00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:44.816
when you got a ride like this?!

19
00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:53.350
What a man needs out
here is a C.B. Radio.

20
00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:55.914
Yeah, is that right?

21
00:04:57.014 --> 00:05:00.559
'Course if you use a C.B.
you gotta have a handle.


22
00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.500
I'm thinking, for you...

23
00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:03.824
'Shit For Brains'.

24
00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:05.800
Tell me something, do you
even care that you...


25
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.751
damn near killed us
back there, boy?!


26
00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:10.262
I didn't really, even,
see you, ok? I mean...


27
00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:11.303
you kinda pulled
out in fronta me...


28
00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:12.511
Like hell I did!

29
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:13.737
I saw what happened!

30
00:05:13.838 --> 00:05:14.862
Let's just forget this, ok?

31
00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:18.079
I mean... I'm sorry it
ever happened.


32
00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:20.079
I don't want any
trouble... I mean...


33
00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:23.441
No, I'll bet you don't.

34
00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:28.279
Howdy, Ma'am.

35
00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.018
Oughta be more careful
who you ride with.


36
00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:34.420
- What was <i>that</i> all about?
- Nothing.


37
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.993
Guy in the truck.

38
00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:38.062
Thinks I tried to hit him!

39
00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:44.840
Come on, Honey, let's go.

40
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.924
Do you want me to drive?

41
00:05:45.924 --> 00:05:47.932
No l.. later. Just... get in.

42
00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:51.905
How 'bout if I promise not
to sidewipe anyone?


43
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:53.279
Just get in!

44
00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.868
I'm kidding!

45
00:06:20.905 --> 00:06:23.712
You getting ready for
the Grand Prix?


46
00:06:27.812 --> 00:06:28.369
What'd you get?

47
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.708
Oh, junk food fiesta.

48
00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:32.947
Let's see...

49
00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:34.946
Sno Balls.

50
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:37.845
Yoo Hoo.

51
00:06:38.723 --> 00:06:39.655
And Moon Pies.

52
00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:42.725
Can you believe they still
make this stuff?


53
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:46.139
Kidding? It's probably gourmet
cuisine around here!


54
00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:58.343
Ha, ha, ha. This is crazy,
look at this...


55
00:06:58.343 --> 00:07:03.149
It says, 'if you win this mail-in contest'...

56
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.853
'you can choose between
ninety-thousand dollars'...


57
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.593
'or, ninety-thousand donuts'.

58
00:07:14.693 --> 00:07:18.263
What would you <i>do</i> with
ninety-thousand donuts?


59
00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:21.134
I don't know... sell them
for thirty cents each...


60
00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:23.234
and pay off this car.

61
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.132
No kidding.

62
00:07:28.006 --> 00:07:30.236
Ninety-thousand dollars!

63
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.868
That'd solve some problems.

64
00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:39.947
What the hell's?

65
00:07:40.518 --> 00:07:41.314
What did you do?

66
00:07:41.453 --> 00:07:42.613
Oh, nothing... I...

67
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.320
Hang on, I can't steer.

68
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.775
Unbelieveable!

69
00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:37.364
Perfect.

70
00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:38.838
Outta range?

71
00:08:41.412 --> 00:08:43.918
Well, so much for taking
the scenic route.


72
00:08:47.018 --> 00:08:49.454
Well, looks like the baffle
gasket's burned out.


73
00:08:49.454 --> 00:08:50.113
What?

74
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:53.024
Yeah, It's connected to the
err... connecting rod.


75
00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:55.217
Oh God... shut up!

76
00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:58.952
Oh man, can you believe this?

77
00:08:59.898 --> 00:09:03.068
This could be the worst decision
you've ever made.


78
00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.794
- What are you doing?
- No, just listen... I mean...


79
00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:07.562
We're changing jobs.

80
00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:08.473
- Yeah?
- Right.


81
00:09:08.473 --> 00:09:11.177
Our finances are...
pretty well fucked, and...


82
00:09:11.277 --> 00:09:12.277
Yeah.

83
00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:14.345
And we are, out in the
middle of nowhere, so...


84
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:17.648
Yeah, I'd say this <i>is</i> the worst
decision you've ever...


85
00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:19.939
Get out of here, you're bugging me.

86
00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:21.843
Okay, sweetie.

87
00:09:22.253 --> 00:09:24.483
Good luck, 'cos I'm going to California.

88
00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:26.958
No problem, just leave
me the Moon Pies.


89
00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.123
- Ah, Jeff?
- And the donuts.


90
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.160
No, no, there's a car.

91
00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.230
Oh Christ, not these guys.

92
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.277
Assholes.

93
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.451
Jeff...

94
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.234
What the hell is...

95
00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.871
- Mmm... what's he doing?
- I don't know.


96
00:10:27.285 --> 00:10:28.980
Ahh, this... this isn't good.

97
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.418
Hey! Ho!

98
00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:02.281
Hi. Folks alright?

99
00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:05.249
Fine. Our... car broke down.

100
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.254
Yeah... saw that.

101
00:11:06.858 --> 00:11:08.659
You want me to give you a hand
pushing it off the road?


102
00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:09.253
Thanks for the help.

103
00:11:09.394 --> 00:11:11.361
- Honey, you wanna steer?
- Yeah.


104
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:14.968
Right, ok.

105
00:11:17.068 --> 00:11:20.231
Massachusetts plates.
You folks on vacation?


106
00:11:21.005 --> 00:11:22.529
No... we're moving.

107
00:11:23.074 --> 00:11:24.769
Oh yeah? Whereabouts?

108
00:11:25.276 --> 00:11:26.470
Ahh, San Diego.

109
00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:30.809
Listen, you think we could
could use your C.B.?


110
00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:32.684
Radio a tow truck to help us?

111
00:11:32.784 --> 00:11:33.820
I wish I could, mister...

112
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.222
but I blew a fuse on that
thing this morning...


113
00:11:35.322 --> 00:11:38.250
I'm waiting 'til I get down to the
truckstop at I40 to get it fixed.


114
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.118
How far is that?

115
00:11:39.118 --> 00:11:40.922
About 60 miles.

116
00:11:40.922 --> 00:11:42.751
Oh... well...

117
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:44.384
just driving along
and she quit on me.


118
00:11:44.484 --> 00:11:47.591
Oh dear. Oil... belts...
battery's working.


119
00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:50.305
You know, used to be you
could give these things...


120
00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:51.872
a kick and a holler and
they'd start right up.


121
00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:54.172
Now they got computers.
and chips, and, shh...


122
00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:55.831
It is a new car.

123
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.442
You know, that could be it.

124
00:11:57.542 --> 00:11:58.600
You been riding this
thing pretty hard?


125
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.248
'Cos they tend to overheat
when they're new.


126
00:12:04.148 --> 00:12:06.986
Well, yeah, I admit
a little, but I...


127
00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:09.711
Tell you what.

128
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:11.751
I can give you a
ride to Belle's...


129
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:13.258
little diner about five miles
down the road.


130
00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:14.120
They got a payphone.

131
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.228
You call a tow truck, they just
come in and haul you out.


132
00:12:17.228 --> 00:12:18.256
Ahh...

133
00:12:19.356 --> 00:12:19.950
you know...

134
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.467
that's really nice of
you to offer.


135
00:12:21.567 --> 00:12:22.067
But I think you got it.

136
00:12:22.067 --> 00:12:25.036
I think we'll just... let her cool
off a little bit and...


137
00:12:25.136 --> 00:12:27.372
Thanks a lot, we really
appreciate it.


138
00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:29.087
I wish you luck getting
it started.


139
00:12:29.107 --> 00:12:30.930
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.


140
00:12:31.749 --> 00:12:33.270
- Honey.
- Ahh, I think he's right.


141
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.780
I think it's probably
just overheated.


142
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.117
Right, but what if
it's not, I mean...


143
00:12:37.217 --> 00:12:39.117
we don't wanna be
stuck out here do we?


144
00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:41.746
No, but I... just give it
it some time.


145
00:12:41.846 --> 00:12:43.790
Let it cool off.
We'll be alright.


146
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.662
Getting... pretty toasty
out here...


147
00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:50.862
you sure you wanna
blow this ride?


148
00:12:50.862 --> 00:12:52.729
No, but...

149
00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:56.234
don't know if I wanna leave
the car alone either.


150
00:12:56.334 --> 00:12:59.573
Ok... what if I take the ride,
call a tow truck, and...


151
00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:01.573
order a nice, cold, iced tea?

152
00:13:01.673 --> 00:13:02.751
Mmm hmm.

153
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:05.109
And I stay here with
a nice hot car.


154
00:13:05.109 --> 00:13:05.840
Right.

155
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.671
Right.

156
00:13:10.348 --> 00:13:11.449
Sure you're alright?

157
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:13.313
No, I'll be fine, Honey.

158
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.944
Hello! Excuse me!

159
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.992
Care if I take you
up on that ride?


160
00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.320
Sure. Step on up.

161
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.950
Sure your husband doesn't
wanna come with us...


162
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.250
there's plenty of room in the back?

163
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.526
No, no, he's gonna stay
the car. But thank you.


164
00:13:30.588 --> 00:13:32.166
Ok... good luck.

165
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.759
What the... hell?!

166
00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:54.057
Ha!

167
00:14:59.157 --> 00:15:00.647
Tow truck, my ass!

168
00:15:44.202 --> 00:15:47.363
Excuse me. I was supposed
to meet my wife here.


169
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.409
Err, she's dark-haired,
about... five-five...


170
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:55.513
wearing like a... a white
Benetton sweater.


171
00:15:55.613 --> 00:15:56.547
White what?

172
00:15:56.547 --> 00:15:57.411
Err, Benetton sweater.

173
00:15:58.649 --> 00:15:59.240
Hank!

174
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.107
Your order's up.

175
00:16:01.452 --> 00:16:03.421
Look I'm pretty busy here,
people come and go.


176
00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:05.334
Well... this was within
the last half-hour.


177
00:16:05.334 --> 00:16:05.975
Excuse me.

178
00:16:06.075 --> 00:16:08.259
She... she might have
been with a trucker.


179
00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:08.816
Trucker?

180
00:16:08.916 --> 00:16:10.098
Yeah, a guy wearing
a baseball cap.


181
00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:11.998
Err... driving a big
eighteen-wheeler.


182
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:14.962
Doesn't ring a bell.

183
00:16:17.068 --> 00:16:17.591
You sure?

184
00:16:20.238 --> 00:16:21.839
Hey, the man here's
looking for his wife.


185
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:25.042
Dark hair... got a white,
button-on sweater.


186
00:16:25.142 --> 00:16:26.706
Travelling with a guy
with a baseball cap.


187
00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:28.609
Has anybody here seen 'em?

188
00:16:32.516 --> 00:16:36.323
Looks like she got away
from you, Cowboy.


189
00:16:39.423 --> 00:16:41.761
You err... you think maybe she
could have left a message...


190
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:44.261
with one of your other
other employees? Or...


191
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:45.550
I don't see how that's possible.

192
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.366
You see, I'm the only
one that works here.


193
00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.466
Well...

194
00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:53.571
is there another
another Belle's Diner?


195
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:57.105
No siree. Definitely not! Ha ha.

196
00:17:38.316 --> 00:17:38.820
Excuse me.

197
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.477
She and I must have got
our signals crossed here.


198
00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:42.751
How far is the next town?

199
00:17:43.788 --> 00:17:45.686
'Bout twenny miles.

200
00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:47.388
Could you do me a favour?

201
00:17:47.758 --> 00:17:49.627
If my wife comes in,
her name's Amy...


202
00:17:49.727 --> 00:17:51.031
would you just, tell
here I was here...


203
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:52.131
and tell her to stay put...

204
00:17:52.131 --> 00:17:54.331
'til I get back, and not move?

205
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:56.027
Could you do that, please?

206
00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:59.192
- Yeah, Okay.
- Thanks.


207
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.804
Hey! Pull over!

208
00:19:07.904 --> 00:19:09.680
Pull over!

209
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.906
I don't believe it.

210
00:19:21.685 --> 00:19:22.208
Jesus!

211
00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:33.153
Christ!

212
00:19:56.253 --> 00:19:57.151
Hey, man...

213
00:20:00.057 --> 00:20:01.459
The hell you doing, buddy?

214
00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:03.518
I was trying to get you to
pull over. Didn't you see me?!


215
00:20:03.618 --> 00:20:04.729
Yeah!

216
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:05.591
Well?

217
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.855
Err... never mind. Listen, I, I, I...
I'm looking for my wife.


218
00:20:08.855 --> 00:20:09.667
What?

219
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:10.895
My wife. Where is she?

220
00:20:11.802 --> 00:20:14.238
How should I know
where your wife is?


221
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:15.749
I'm the guy with the Jeep.

222
00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:17.305
You gave my wife a ride.

223
00:20:17.305 --> 00:20:18.943
You were supposed to drop
her off at Belle's Diner.


224
00:20:18.943 --> 00:20:19.850
Not me, sorry.

225
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.611
Wait a minute...
what you mean 'sorry'?


226
00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:23.442
This was like a half an hour
ago, for Christ's sake.


227
00:20:23.442 --> 00:20:25.216
You don't remember?!

228
00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:26.285
Look, I don't know how
to tell you this...


229
00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:29.522
but I've never seen you
before in my life.


230
00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:32.250
What are you doing?

231
00:20:35.426 --> 00:20:36.324
Amy!

232
00:20:40.024 --> 00:20:41.567
Amy, are you in there?!

233
00:20:43.667 --> 00:20:45.965
Look, mister, I don't
know what you want...


234
00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:48.349
I want my wife back,
is what I <i>want</i>!


235
00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:50.449
Now what have you done...

236
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:56.349
Hey!

237
00:20:58.449 --> 00:21:00.986
Officer! Officer, I need
you help here.


238
00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:03.850
- What's the problem?
- I don't know...


239
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.055
I think this guy's done
something with my wife.


240
00:21:06.055 --> 00:21:07.892
Alright. Calm down, sir.
Tell me what's going on.


241
00:21:07.992 --> 00:21:09.326
I don't know what the
hell's going on.


242
00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:11.864
Last I saw her, she
was with this guy...


243
00:21:11.964 --> 00:21:12.964
in his truck.

244
00:21:13.964 --> 00:21:15.422
Now he's saying he's
never seen her.


245
00:21:15.522 --> 00:21:17.601
Officer... I don't know what
he's talking about.


246
00:21:17.701 --> 00:21:18.701
Don't lie. You son-of-a-bitch!

247
00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:19.749
Alright, alright, calm down.

248
00:21:19.749 --> 00:21:21.749
Alright, now tell me exactly
what happened, sir.


249
00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:22.873
Ok. Alright.

250
00:21:24.775 --> 00:21:25.742
Our car broke down.

251
00:21:26.677 --> 00:21:28.975
Now he stopped, offered to help...

252
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.748
took my wife to a pay phone
but she... she never showed up.


253
00:21:33.484 --> 00:21:36.053
Sir, what do you have
to say about this?


254
00:21:36.153 --> 00:21:37.120
Officer, I don't know.

255
00:21:37.821 --> 00:21:41.052
I'm driving along... this
fella runs me off the road...


256
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:42.419
starts hollering about his wife.

257
00:21:42.626 --> 00:21:44.998
I swear, I've never seen
him before in my life.


258
00:21:46.098 --> 00:21:47.598
And you didn't give
his wife a ride?


259
00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:49.723
- No, sir.
- He's lying!


260
00:21:53.804 --> 00:21:56.163
Sir, would it be alright with
you if I search your truck?


261
00:21:56.163 --> 00:21:57.268
Hell, yes. Go ahead.

262
00:21:58.075 --> 00:22:00.845
Name's Barr, by the way.
Red Barr.


263
00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.104
All my, err, permits
are current.


264
00:22:02.104 --> 00:22:03.313
You can see 'em, they're
right up in there.


265
00:22:03.313 --> 00:22:04.313
That won't be necessary.

266
00:22:04.313 --> 00:22:06.477
Just stand back behind
the line, both of you.


267
00:22:45.177 --> 00:22:47.350
I need to see your license
and registration, please.


268
00:23:11.148 --> 00:23:11.944
Those yours?

269
00:23:13.044 --> 00:23:14.451
Yeah.

270
00:23:14.551 --> 00:23:16.818
It's my, err, personal stuff.
You wanna take a look?


271
00:23:22.459 --> 00:23:27.298
No... no, I think we're
pretty much done here.


272
00:23:27.398 --> 00:23:28.255
You're free to go.

273
00:23:28.255 --> 00:23:30.232
Wait a minute, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a second... that's it?


274
00:23:30.232 --> 00:23:32.060
You're not gonna question
him anymore?


275
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.465
Sir, I've searched the truck.

276
00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:35.751
There's no evidence of
suspicious activity here.


277
00:23:35.751 --> 00:23:37.341
- No sign of a struggle.
- What?


278
00:23:37.341 --> 00:23:38.441
Look, I don't mean
to butt in, but...


279
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:40.177
maybe you confused my truck
with somebody elses.


280
00:23:40.277 --> 00:23:41.638
Go to hell you son-of-a-bitch!
Let me see that...


281
00:23:41.638 --> 00:23:46.073
Hey! Now hold on a second.
You wanna get arrested?


282
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.315
Now, the man's got a point here.

283
00:23:48.318 --> 00:23:51.810
This is a very plain looking truck.
A lot of trucks look just like it.


284
00:23:52.856 --> 00:23:55.060
Now maybe you did
get 'em mixed up.


285
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:56.751
Hey!

286
00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:57.974
You stay put.

287
00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:10.938
Mr. Taylor?

288
00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:18.120
Come on.

289
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.152
It was him.

290
00:24:24.988 --> 00:24:26.285
It was <i>this</i> truck.

291
00:24:26.356 --> 00:24:27.789
Uh-huh, I can see that.

292
00:24:28.192 --> 00:24:29.955
Did you get a license plate
number on that truck?


293
00:24:30.055 --> 00:24:32.296
What? No!

294
00:24:32.396 --> 00:24:33.865
How about the information
on that door panel...


295
00:24:33.965 --> 00:24:34.865
you recall any of that?

296
00:24:34.865 --> 00:24:38.304
I wasn't paying attention.
Come on, Officer.


297
00:24:40.404 --> 00:24:41.965
Mr. Taylor, did you err...

298
00:24:42.065 --> 00:24:45.276
by any chance have a beef
with your wife today?


299
00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:48.646
What has <i>that</i> got to do
with <i>anything</i>?!


300
00:24:48.746 --> 00:24:49.746
Well, for starters, maybe...

301
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.011
is there a possibility
she could have left you?


302
00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:55.717
I don't... I don't  believe this.

303
00:24:56.587 --> 00:24:58.384
My wife did <i>not</i> leave me!

304
00:24:58.856 --> 00:25:00.427
Mr Taylor, I've seen it a
hundred times...


305
00:25:00.427 --> 00:25:01.751
you put two people in
a car long enough...


306
00:25:01.751 --> 00:25:03.227
they're gonna go at it.

307
00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:04.962
Lovers, married couples,
gay guys.


308
00:25:04.962 --> 00:25:06.932
Hell, I've seen men dump their
women on the side of the road...


309
00:25:06.932 --> 00:25:08.332
and vice versa.

310
00:25:08.332 --> 00:25:09.390
Officer, err...

311
00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:12.374
I'd really like to stay
and help but, err...


312
00:25:12.474 --> 00:25:14.374
I got a long haul to Fresno.

313
00:25:14.474 --> 00:25:17.474
I understand, go ahead,
'preciate your cooperation.


314
00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:20.511
This is insane.
Officer, please.


315
00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:22.854
I've got his information, alright.
If I need to find him later...


316
00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:24.954
I know where to look.

317
00:25:26.054 --> 00:25:27.254
Sir.

318
00:25:30.954 --> 00:25:32.682
Much obliged.

319
00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.524
And ahh...

320
00:25:35.624 --> 00:25:39.688
Look, it's no hard feelings.
I really do hope you find your wife.


321
00:25:40.388 --> 00:25:41.704
Thanks.

322
00:25:47.304 --> 00:25:49.536
Mr. Taylor, you wanna
come with me.


323
00:26:19.636 --> 00:26:21.331
Sir, I  believe you that
your wife's missing.


324
00:26:21.672 --> 00:26:22.751
Alright, now maybe
you got confused...


325
00:26:22.751 --> 00:26:24.444
about what kind of
truck she got into...


326
00:26:24.544 --> 00:26:25.244
and maybe you didn't.

327
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.244
Point is, I'm trying to help.

328
00:26:27.344 --> 00:26:29.646
The town of Brackett's thirty-one
miles back that way.


329
00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:32.316
My deputy's name is Len Carver.
He's a good man.


330
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:34.088
He'll help you fill out all the
necessary forms...


331
00:26:34.088 --> 00:26:36.749
if you wanna report
your wife missing. Right?


332
00:26:37.788 --> 00:26:39.188
Sheriff, this is dispatch...

333
00:26:39.188 --> 00:26:41.188
Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of
her trailer again.


334
00:26:41.188 --> 00:26:42.717
Can you help her?

335
00:26:42.817 --> 00:26:45.156
Ten Four, dispatch. Tell her
I'm on my way.


336
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:46.153
Will do.

337
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.488
Mr. Taylor, do yourself
a favour.


338
00:26:51.168 --> 00:26:52.135
Go see my deputy.

339
00:27:20.235 --> 00:27:22.499
This a recent picture?

340
00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:23.964
It's a... couple months old.

341
00:27:24.668 --> 00:27:26.930
She still wear her hair like this?

342
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.675
Yeah.

343
00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:36.113
Well... we'll certainly do
our best, Mr Taylor.


344
00:27:36.213 --> 00:27:38.217
You know there's over a hundred
thousand people go missing...


345
00:27:38.317 --> 00:27:40.317
in this country, every year.

346
00:27:40.317 --> 00:27:42.512
Runaways, deadbeat dads...

347
00:27:42.653 --> 00:27:45.823
dropouts. Folks hiding
from the IRS.


348
00:27:45.923 --> 00:27:48.016
All vanishing without a trace.

349
00:27:48.425 --> 00:27:50.163
We get these kind of
pictures all the time...


350
00:27:50.263 --> 00:27:52.263
from all over the place.

351
00:27:53.263 --> 00:27:55.933
I'm not saying that your
wife is one of 'em.


352
00:27:56.033 --> 00:27:56.931
I sure hope not.

353
00:27:57.401 --> 00:27:58.701
But...

354
00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:00.083
unless there's been a
ransom demand...


355
00:28:00.083 --> 00:28:01.751
or evidence of forced
abduction...


356
00:28:01.751 --> 00:28:03.877
believe me, the FBI won't
even look at your case...


357
00:28:03.877 --> 00:28:07.177
until it's been
twenty-four hours.


358
00:28:07.177 --> 00:28:11.223
Nevertheless, we will certainly
keep our eyes peeled.


359
00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:20.187
Mr. Taylor.

360
00:28:21.758 --> 00:28:23.055
Why don't you go back to Belle's?

361
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.897
Get a cup of coffee.
Wait for your wife.


362
00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:30.334
If anything comes up,
I'll contact you first thing.


363
00:28:30.434 --> 00:28:31.298
How's that sound?

364
00:28:33.398 --> 00:28:34.295
Yeah.

365
00:28:58.395 --> 00:28:59.327
Did my wife come in?

366
00:29:01.498 --> 00:29:02.328
Didn't see her.

367
00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:05.749
You didn't see her, or
she didn't come in?


368
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.450
Look, like I told you
the last time...


369
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.650
maybe she was in,
maybe she wasn't.


370
00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:12.250
All I'm saying is that
I didn't see her.


371
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:23.021
It ain't none of my
business, mister, but...


372
00:29:23.121 --> 00:29:26.645
I's you... I'd check
the ladies' room.


373
00:29:41.204 --> 00:29:41.932
Amy?

374
00:29:44.032 --> 00:29:45.643
Amy!

375
00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:48.749
I'll be right with you, cowboy.

376
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.321
I wanna see your order slips.

377
00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:37.217
What?

378
00:30:37.527 --> 00:30:39.730
You write down the names.
I wanna see 'em.


379
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.924
Are you nuts? I don't have
to show you jack-shit!


380
00:30:44.534 --> 00:30:48.940
If my wife came in here... then
her name's in that pile.


381
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.132
You calling me a liar?

382
00:30:53.343 --> 00:30:54.742
Let me see these fucking slips!

383
00:31:02.842 --> 00:31:05.485
Mister. I had just about
enough of you.


384
00:31:35.585 --> 00:31:36.119
Operator.

385
00:31:36.219 --> 00:31:37.751
Operator... give me
the Sheriff's office.


386
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:39.091
One moment, please.

387
00:31:40.191 --> 00:31:41.091
Come on!

388
00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:42.749
My name's Billy.

389
00:31:45.061 --> 00:31:47.549
You the fella looking for his wife?

390
00:31:49.129 --> 00:31:49.838
Yes!

391
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:52.838
Yeah, how'd you know?

392
00:31:52.938 --> 00:31:54.700
Did you see her?

393
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.940
You seen her?

394
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.842
Please, if you know
something, tell me!


395
00:31:58.942 --> 00:32:01.645
Well, I, I, I, seen
her... maybe.


396
00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:02.712
Where? When?

397
00:32:03.813 --> 00:32:06.008
Inside, a little while ago.

398
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.081
She came in on a truck.

399
00:32:09.181 --> 00:32:10.020
Right.

400
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.781
- A big semi.
- Then what?


401
00:32:13.089 --> 00:32:17.117
Well... then she left, on...

402
00:32:17.217 --> 00:32:18.562
on another truck.

403
00:32:18.662 --> 00:32:19.993
Another... with who?

404
00:32:21.566 --> 00:32:24.193
Oh... some men.

405
00:32:24.968 --> 00:32:27.537
Oh they think I'm a
dummy, but I ain't.


406
00:32:27.637 --> 00:32:29.906
I'm gonna get my trucker's
license one day.


407
00:32:29.932 --> 00:32:31.931
This is very important...

408
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:34.379
Did you see where
they took my wife?


409
00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:35.379
Uh-huh.

410
00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:40.283
Route Seven, North.
Up by the river.


411
00:32:40.283 --> 00:32:42.250
By the river? Where?

412
00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:50.727
Oh, they don't tell me
that kind of thing.


413
00:32:50.827 --> 00:32:52.692
Who doesn't? The bartender?

414
00:32:53.496 --> 00:32:54.463
The men in the truck?

415
00:32:55.899 --> 00:32:58.068
Oh, I, I ain't talking
to you no more.


416
00:32:58.068 --> 00:32:59.068
Wait a minute...

417
00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:01.107
You need to come with
me to the police.


418
00:33:01.107 --> 00:33:03.307
You tell them what you saw,
they can help me.


419
00:33:04.307 --> 00:33:05.831
Well now, you the dummy.

420
00:33:06.643 --> 00:33:08.445
What's that supposed
to mean?


421
00:33:08.545 --> 00:33:10.318
Well don't you get it?

422
00:33:10.418 --> 00:33:13.418
Police is the one's in on it.

423
00:33:29.766 --> 00:33:32.028
Come on. Work, godammit it.

424
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.947
Hello? Yeah, Steve?
This is Jeffrey Taylor...


425
00:33:42.947 --> 00:33:43.947
you remember...

426
00:33:44.047 --> 00:33:44.947
right.

427
00:33:44.947 --> 00:33:46.574
Don't put me on hold, please.

428
00:33:46.749 --> 00:33:47.808
Listen, I need a favour.

429
00:33:48.885 --> 00:33:52.422
I gotta talk to that friend
of yours at the FBI.


430
00:33:52.522 --> 00:33:55.525
Right. Ah, It's about Amy.

431
00:33:55.639 --> 00:33:56.893
Now something's
happening...


432
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:58.036
Amy, yeah I think
she's been...


433
00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.236
she's missing.
I think she's...


434
00:34:00.336 --> 00:34:02.036
Hello? Fuck!

435
00:34:05.136 --> 00:34:06.036
Yeah?

436
00:34:06.136 --> 00:34:09.539
Steve? Yeah. No.
No don't call me back!


437
00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:12.539
Don't... Steve! Steve!

438
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.701
Shit!

439
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.701
What the...?!

440
00:34:37.801 --> 00:34:40.160
- Get out of the car now!
- Oh shit!


441
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.160
Damn, son-of-a-bitch!

442
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.160
Arrgh!

443
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.160
Son-of-a-bitch!

444
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.124
What do you want?

445
00:36:29.846 --> 00:36:30.744
He's getting away!

446
00:38:36.673 --> 00:38:38.163
What the hell is going on?

447
00:38:38.675 --> 00:38:40.074
Got away. Went down the river.

448
00:39:17.513 --> 00:39:20.277
Yeah... we're pulling it out now.

449
00:39:21.884 --> 00:39:23.751
Careful. Don't let it come loose.

450
00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:25.411
I got it.

451
00:39:27.724 --> 00:39:30.150
This is what happens when you
get one, without the other.


452
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.893
Stop worrying.

453
00:39:30.893 --> 00:39:32.762
How the hell we gonna explain
this to Warren?


454
00:39:32.762 --> 00:39:34.490
I ain't gonna explain it.

455
00:39:40.403 --> 00:39:43.250
Hey. You all right?

456
00:39:56.052 --> 00:39:58.751
Now, according to your wife...

457
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.150
you got a good pile of cash sitting
in your bank account at home.


458
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:02.401
Is that true?

459
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:04.694
What? Th... there's
some, yeah.


460
00:40:04.794 --> 00:40:07.630
Mmm, well, 'some' just
don't cut it.


461
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.969
She gave us an exact
dollar amount.


462
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:12.469
Now, I want that same
figure from you.


463
00:40:12.549 --> 00:40:13.751
Wha... what do you...

464
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:16.835
I don't... it's different accounts.

465
00:40:17.473 --> 00:40:18.770
Balance fluctuates, I don't...

466
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:20.101
Fluctuates my ass.

467
00:40:20.576 --> 00:40:24.152
If some hotshot fuck like you
ain't watching his bottom line...


468
00:40:24.252 --> 00:40:26.152
it'd be the <i>first</i> time in history!

469
00:40:29.252 --> 00:40:30.514
What do you think, Earl?

470
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.881
What I think is we been lied to.

471
00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:35.053
He ain't no goddamn donut king!

472
00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:37.723
The slut was lying to save her ass.

473
00:40:37.861 --> 00:40:38.855
Piece of shit.

474
00:40:38.955 --> 00:40:40.351
- Jesus! No!
- I'm gonna do 'im.


475
00:40:40.405 --> 00:40:41.757
Ninety-thousand!

476
00:40:43.466 --> 00:40:45.558
Ninety-thousand dollars.

477
00:40:52.008 --> 00:40:54.631
Now you crawl your
ass outta there.


478
00:41:14.731 --> 00:41:18.134
You're a tough man
get hold of, Jeffrey.


479
00:41:18.234 --> 00:41:19.030
What do you want?

480
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:23.100
Huh... it's not what <i>I</i> want,
it's what <i>you</i> want.


481
00:41:23.873 --> 00:41:26.137
How bad do you want it?
'Cos it is gonna cost ya.


482
00:41:27.243 --> 00:41:28.642
Can't show it to you right now...

483
00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:31.948
It's about five-five, a hundred
and fifteen pounds.


484
00:41:32.048 --> 00:41:34.016
Three or four of that just pure tit.

485
00:41:34.984 --> 00:41:37.509
Nice curly brown hair
upstairs and down.


486
00:41:39.424 --> 00:41:40.186
Interested?

487
00:41:41.593 --> 00:41:43.686
Why?

488
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:45.928
What does... why, why us?

489
00:41:47.028 --> 00:41:47.942
Huh.

490
00:41:48.042 --> 00:41:49.339
Bring him up here.

491
00:41:59.712 --> 00:42:01.680
Town of Brackett, Jeff.

492
00:42:02.415 --> 00:42:05.620
Two-bit shit-hole in the
middle of nowhere.


493
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.655
See that bank down there?

494
00:42:10.823 --> 00:42:11.790
Few mintues you're
gonna walk in...


495
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.350
tell the manager you
want an express wire...


496
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.156
in the amount of ninety
thousand dollars...


497
00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:17.156
from your bank account
in Boston.


498
00:42:17.157 --> 00:42:18.864
Cash.

499
00:42:21.964 --> 00:42:23.431
How do I know she's still alive?

500
00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:25.739
- Arrrgh!
- Shut up!


501
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:31.305
Come on, Jeff.

502
00:42:31.374 --> 00:42:32.841
Need you to pay attention.

503
00:42:37.547 --> 00:42:41.785
Now you see that building with the
flagpole coming out the top of it?


504
00:42:41.885 --> 00:42:42.785
Yeah.

505
00:42:42.885 --> 00:42:44.479
That's the sheriff's station.

506
00:42:45.054 --> 00:42:46.450
There's exactly two cops
in this town...


507
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.754
one of them's pulling
desk duty right now...


508
00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:50.259
the other one's on patrol
in the foothills.


509
00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:51.749
A minute ago, Billy here...

510
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:54.627
called in an accident on
the l-40 connector.


511
00:42:56.632 --> 00:42:58.749
See? There he goes.

512
00:43:01.304 --> 00:43:02.550
It's gonna take about
twenty minutes...


513
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.042
for that cracker to get
out to the connector...


514
00:43:04.142 --> 00:43:06.042
another ten minutes to
see there's no accident...


515
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:07.400
another twenty minutes
to get back in.


516
00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:08.437
That's fifty minutes.

517
00:43:08.537 --> 00:43:10.286
That is exactly the amount
of time you have...


518
00:43:10.386 --> 00:43:12.186
to get me my money.

519
00:43:17.286 --> 00:43:19.350
And before you get any
half-baked ideas...


520
00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.890
about calling in the Cavalry...

521
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.751
just remember we're gonna
be watching you...


522
00:43:22.752 --> 00:43:24.160
every step of the way.

523
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.797
And we're gonna be listening
on those scanners.


524
00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:29.728
And if we see anything unusual...

525
00:43:30.132 --> 00:43:31.759
an unmarked car, a plane,

526
00:43:31.934 --> 00:43:35.772
one human being who
even smells like a cop...


527
00:43:35.872 --> 00:43:39.175
well you can just keep your
fucking money, Jeff.


528
00:43:39.275 --> 00:43:42.709
And I'll send you pieces of her
from time to time.


529
00:43:45.615 --> 00:43:46.343
Billy.

530
00:43:47.783 --> 00:43:48.647
Give him the jacket.

531
00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:54.749
Well go on. Put it on, Jeff.

532
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:58.263
Can't go into a bank looking
like that, now can you?


533
00:44:00.363 --> 00:44:01.550
We don't have to do this...

534
00:44:01.575 --> 00:44:05.134
because I can get you that
money. I swear to God.


535
00:44:05.134 --> 00:44:08.659
Promise you'll Just let
my wife go, please!


536
00:44:09.238 --> 00:44:10.466
Forty-nine minutes, Jeff.

537
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.330
Time to get the show
on the road.


538
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:11.634
Here's my... driver's license,
credit card. If you need it.


539
00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:13.636
Account number for
my bank in Boston.


540
00:45:13.736 --> 00:45:15.050
How long's this gonna take?

541
00:45:15.238 --> 00:45:18.820
- Erm, eh. Are you, erm... all right?
- Yeah, I am. Fine.


542
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.310
Look I only got five-thousand
dollars in that account, and erm...


543
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.250
how much can you advance
me on my... my credit card?


544
00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.250
Oh... now. Excuse me?

545
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.748
Credit card. It's got six
thousand loan limit...


546
00:45:26.749 --> 00:45:28.584
can you advance me the
whole six-thousand?


547
00:45:28.584 --> 00:45:30.677
No... I, sorry, I can't.

548
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.725
The, err... limit for
non-customers...


549
00:45:32.825 --> 00:45:35.726
is five-hundred dollars a day.

550
00:45:36.826 --> 00:45:40.797
Sir... are you <i>sure</i>
you're alright?


551
00:45:41.897 --> 00:45:43.693
Yeah, I'm fine.

552
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.056
Just...  transfer the
money. Ok?


553
00:46:07.156 --> 00:46:08.248
I'm gonna tell you something.

554
00:46:11.827 --> 00:46:13.158
What I'm about to tell you...

555
00:46:15.931 --> 00:46:19.039
you can't call anyone.
Do you understand?


556
00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:21.039
Yes...?

557
00:46:23.139 --> 00:46:26.631
Whatever happens, just...
just keep writing on that pad.


558
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.739
Please, now. Just
keep writing.


559
00:46:33.516 --> 00:46:34.850
They're probably watching
me right now, they...


560
00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:37.486
they've got voice
scanners and...


561
00:46:37.486 --> 00:46:41.025
the whole town's under
surveillance.


562
00:46:43.125 --> 00:46:44.922
If I don't walk out of here...

563
00:46:46.022 --> 00:46:46.797
with...

564
00:46:47.897 --> 00:46:50.255
'Scuse me. You the manager?

565
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.458
Yes, I am.

566
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:54.837
Lady back there said I should
see you 'bout a car loan.


567
00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:56.063
Certainly, erm...

568
00:46:56.739 --> 00:46:59.798
If, err, you would just, err,
take a seat...


569
00:47:11.898 --> 00:47:13.798
Yes?

570
00:47:22.898 --> 00:47:24.336
Just err...

571
00:47:24.436 --> 00:47:26.238
f...f... forget it...
I, I ,I had a...


572
00:47:26.338 --> 00:47:27.338
car accident, you know.

573
00:47:27.438 --> 00:47:29.138
Minor... an acci... just...

574
00:47:29.238 --> 00:47:31.262
I'm just, kinda...

575
00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.800
How long's this gonna take?

576
00:47:34.543 --> 00:47:36.104
It'll, erm...

577
00:47:36.204 --> 00:47:39.158
well it's... going to take
a few minutes.


578
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:56.530
Yeah, I um, I'm calling regarding
account number 98258103.


579
00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.992
A Jeffrey Taylor.

580
00:48:02.092 --> 00:48:03.173
Uh-huh.

581
00:48:04.273 --> 00:48:07.097
Well, he'd like to... liquidate
his account, and err...


582
00:48:10.197 --> 00:48:12.097
that's right, the <i>full</i> transfer.

583
00:48:28.197 --> 00:48:28.788
Shit!

584
00:50:38.994 --> 00:50:39.722
It's me.

585
00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:43.154
No shit. I can see that.
How much you got?


586
00:50:48.237 --> 00:50:51.073
The whole thing.
Ninety-thousand.


587
00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:51.867
That's good.

588
00:50:52.508 --> 00:50:53.450
Now I want you to turn left...

589
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:54.751
start walking toward
the main road...


590
00:50:54.752 --> 00:50:56.250
and get in the first
car that stops.


591
00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:57.814
You get that?

592
00:50:58.914 --> 00:51:00.211
When do I see my wife?

593
00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:04.325
Soon enough, Jeff.
Just start walking.


594
00:52:16.425 --> 00:52:18.749
Just throw the money right
up here on the seat.


595
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.762
No.

596
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:22.697
First you tell me where she is.

597
00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:23.976
Wrong, asshole...

598
00:52:24.076 --> 00:52:26.102
first you give me the money
and then you find out.


599
00:52:27.202 --> 00:52:29.099
'Less you want me just to
shoot your ass dead...


600
00:52:29.099 --> 00:52:31.892
right here on the side
of the highway?


601
00:52:49.892 --> 00:52:50.756
Turn around.

602
00:52:53.429 --> 00:52:54.123
Do it!

603
00:53:01.236 --> 00:53:02.726
Put your hands behind you.

604
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.751
Step toward the truck.

605
00:53:17.386 --> 00:53:19.955
Now get up in the truck.
On your knees.


606
00:53:20.055 --> 00:53:21.987
Get in here, goddammit!

607
00:53:40.676 --> 00:53:43.281
I gave you the money.
Now let her go.


608
00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:46.281
Ha, ha, ha.

609
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:48.027
- The the hell do I...
- Shut up!


610
00:53:57.127 --> 00:53:58.027
Yup.

611
00:53:59.127 --> 00:54:00.059
Yeah, it's a done deal.

612
00:54:01.129 --> 00:54:01.925
I'm heading in.

613
00:54:03.025 --> 00:54:04.573
Yeah, I got you.

614
00:54:11.673 --> 00:54:13.944
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker yet.


615
00:54:16.044 --> 00:54:18.012
Think we just picked you
out of the clear blue?


616
00:54:19.047 --> 00:54:20.105
Shiny new car.

617
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:22.717
Massachusetts plates.

618
00:54:23.218 --> 00:54:25.277
Probably be a week before
anybody even misses you.


619
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:30.592
Should have got that bumper
sticker that goes with that car:


620
00:54:30.692 --> 00:54:33.887
'Rich Assholes Looking For Trouble'.

621
00:54:47.987 --> 00:54:49.445
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

622
00:54:49.545 --> 00:54:50.982
Sure wish I'd been there.

623
00:54:51.082 --> 00:54:52.250
See the look on your face...

624
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.916
when your car seized
up on you.


625
00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:56.284
Maybe next time you'll learn...

626
00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:59.410
don't leave your hood open
when you go in the store.


627
00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:18.844
The hell is that?!

628
00:55:21.944 --> 00:55:23.951
These ain't nothing but
goddamn singles!


629
00:55:24.051 --> 00:55:25.951
Lying son-of-a...

630
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:13.951
Shit!

631
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:26.951
Hey!

632
00:56:27.051 --> 00:56:28.951
Whaddya doing in there?!

633
00:56:33.051 --> 00:56:33.951
Hey!

634
00:56:36.051 --> 00:56:36.881
Where is she?!

635
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:38.987
Fuck you!

636
00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:40.079
No... fuck you!

637
00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:44.628
You like that?
How 'bout this?


638
00:56:46.728 --> 00:56:48.161
- Where is she?
- I don't know.


639
00:56:49.498 --> 00:56:50.465
The fuck you don't know.

640
00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:56.332
Stop... stop.

641
00:56:57.406 --> 00:56:59.374
What's that? You want
me to stop?


642
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:00.398
You really want me to stop?

643
00:57:00.498 --> 00:57:03.675
'Cos I'll bet this baby stops
on a fucking dime!


644
00:57:17.959 --> 00:57:18.926
What the hell?!

645
00:57:27.536 --> 00:57:28.195
Where is she?!

646
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:29.437
She's with Billy.

647
00:57:29.705 --> 00:57:30.194
Where?

648
00:57:30.272 --> 00:57:32.200
I dunno they're driving
around somewhere.


649
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.263
Bullshit!

650
00:57:34.443 --> 00:57:37.412
I'm in pursuit of a
black, Ford F150 pickup truck.


651
00:57:37.813 --> 00:57:39.144
Contact the State Police.

652
00:57:39.347 --> 00:57:41.751
We're headed northbound.
Highway 31.


653
00:57:41.751 --> 00:57:44.119
I need backup.
Repeat, backup.


654
00:57:44.119 --> 00:57:45.579
Where were you taking
the money?


655
00:57:45.679 --> 00:57:46.755
To the truck stop.

656
00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:48.250
Where, exactly? Where?!

657
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:51.160
On the main highway.
The Texaco.


658
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.160
Son-of-a-bitch!

659
00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.751
Officer! Officer, you gotta help
me, my wife's been kidnapped!


660
00:57:59.751 --> 00:58:01.885
- Drop the gun!
- Woah, woah, wait. I... you got it!


661
00:58:01.985 --> 00:58:02.364
Get down!

662
00:58:02.466 --> 00:58:03.650
I know where
she is.


663
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:04.550
She...

664
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.436
Get down on the ground!

665
00:58:05.536 --> 00:58:07.549
- Do it!
- Alright, I'm down.


666
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:08.649
Listen to me.

667
00:58:08.905 --> 00:58:09.633
He's in on it.

668
00:58:09.733 --> 00:58:11.668
He's with the trucker.
They kidnapped my wife.


669
00:58:11.768 --> 00:58:13.751
There's four of 'em. Th... they
all work together.


670
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:15.513
They got her right now
at a truck stop, at Texaco.


671
00:58:15.613 --> 00:58:16.513
Face down!

672
00:58:16.613 --> 00:58:17.477
Shut up!

673
00:58:19.082 --> 00:58:20.342
You in the pickup,
you alright?


674
00:58:20.342 --> 00:58:22.150
(Oh... please... you have
to believe me...)


675
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:23.450
(why else would I be out
here in the middle of...)


676
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:24.578
Yes, sir, I'm okay.

677
00:58:24.678 --> 00:58:26.250
Can you get out?

678
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.492
Yes I can, Sir. Please
don't shoot me.


679
00:58:28.592 --> 00:58:29.600
There's a bag with
money in there...


680
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.850
and I swear to God it's
right in there...


681
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:33.265
Face down, spread-eagle
and shut up!


682
00:58:34.749 --> 00:58:37.229
Get out, damn it!

683
00:58:37.367 --> 00:58:39.469
Godammit, listen to
what I'm telling you!


684
00:58:39.569 --> 00:58:40.900
Shut the <i>fuck</i> up!

685
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:42.249
Arrgh!

686
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:54.509
Hey, shit-for-brains.

687
00:58:54.609 --> 00:58:55.773
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...

688
00:59:16.873 --> 00:59:18.143
Shots fired.

689
00:59:20.243 --> 00:59:21.210
Officer down.

690
00:59:27.117 --> 00:59:28.243
Suspect identified.

691
00:59:32.255 --> 00:59:34.294
Sheriff? This is State
Police dispatch.


692
00:59:34.394 --> 00:59:35.394
What is your twenty?

693
00:59:37.394 --> 00:59:39.396
Get an ambulance,
he's been shot.


694
00:59:39.496 --> 00:59:41.190
Who is this?

695
00:59:41.498 --> 00:59:42.360
Sheriff, can you respond?

696
00:59:42.399 --> 00:59:44.229
They're coming.

697
00:59:48.772 --> 00:59:51.244
Sheriff, hang on. We're
bringing you an ambulance.


698
00:59:54.344 --> 00:59:56.350
All units! All units!
Officer down!


699
00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:57.761
Repeat, Officer down!

700
00:59:57.861 --> 00:59:59.761
I repeat...

701
01:00:04.861 --> 01:00:05.761
Sheriff?

702
01:01:17.861 --> 01:01:19.350
Look, I don't know dammit, he
was supposed to be here...


703
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:21.550
a half an hour ago.

704
01:01:21.698 --> 01:01:23.200
And I heard a report on
the police band...


705
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.535
about a cop down.

706
01:01:25.535 --> 01:01:27.806
I'm leaving. I can't... there's too
much heat around here.


707
01:01:27.906 --> 01:01:29.706
So, stay off the airwaves...

708
01:01:29.806 --> 01:01:31.784
get his wife and meet
me at the barn.


709
01:01:31.884 --> 01:01:34.984
I don't <i>care</i> if you have
to drive all night!


710
01:05:34.884 --> 01:05:35.908
Daddy, you're home!

711
01:05:36.086 --> 01:05:39.110
- Hey... Deke! Miss me?
- Yeah.


712
01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:40.512
Deke, get back to bed.

713
01:05:40.957 --> 01:05:42.991
Warren, I thought you were
coming back next week.


714
01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:45.695
Yeah, well I finished early.
And now I'm home.


715
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:48.164
Al and Billy are coming over
in a little while too.


716
01:05:48.264 --> 01:05:51.201
But it's six in the morning. Can't
they come some other time?


717
01:05:51.301 --> 01:05:52.749
Look, we got some
stuff to do, Ok?


718
01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:54.600
It's gonna take a
couple a hours.


719
01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.573
Why don't you go in
and make breakfast?


720
01:05:56.673 --> 01:05:57.367
Hey, Deke!

721
01:05:57.467 --> 01:05:58.475
Yeah?

722
01:05:58.575 --> 01:05:59.735
Wanna open the barn
for your Dad?


723
01:05:59.835 --> 01:06:00.876
Ok.

724
01:06:32.976 --> 01:06:35.645
He-he-hey, Dekey.
Hey, thanks.


725
01:06:35.745 --> 01:06:37.350
Hey, I got something for you.

726
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.549
Ready? Mmm?

727
01:06:39.649 --> 01:06:40.749
Here you go, Son.

728
01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:42.709
Look at that.

729
01:06:42.709 --> 01:06:44.519
- Cool!
- Cool.


730
01:06:44.519 --> 01:06:47.590
Ha, ha. A real Swiss
Army knife.


731
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:48.749
Good boy.

732
01:07:31.734 --> 01:07:32.359
Deke?

733
01:07:34.237 --> 01:07:35.363
Deke, you back there?

734
01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.990
If I never see another
couple from Massachusetts...


735
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:35.558
it'll be too soon.

736
01:09:35.658 --> 01:09:37.751
- Yeah.
- Ok, ok, we gotta a lota work to do.


737
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.395
First off, you got any
word on Earl?


738
01:09:39.495 --> 01:09:40.223
Not a thing.

739
01:09:40.563 --> 01:09:41.188
Me neither.

740
01:09:41.288 --> 01:09:41.850
Fuck!

741
01:09:42.698 --> 01:09:44.247
Ok, we gotta get this
stuff off the truck.


742
01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:45.447
Now, anything...

743
01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:48.447
that can trace us back to
that fuck, we get rid of.


744
01:09:48.447 --> 01:09:50.547
Anything, Billy. You got that?

745
01:09:57.647 --> 01:09:58.550
You know, none of this
would've happened...


746
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:59.751
if you'd gotten that jerk...

747
01:09:59.751 --> 01:10:01.108
the same time as his wife.

748
01:10:01.651 --> 01:10:03.850
Wouldn't get in the
fucking truck.


749
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.350
I suppose you'd just
pick up a gun...


750
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.857
chase him out into
the desert?


751
01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:07.757
Fucking idiot!

752
01:10:07.857 --> 01:10:08.915
Look, I'm just saying...

753
01:10:09.225 --> 01:10:10.200
you should have gotten
rid of 'em...


754
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.528
just like that couple in Ohio.

755
01:10:11.628 --> 01:10:12.350
Nice 'n clean.

756
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:14.433
So we stay out of the area
for a couple of months.


757
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:16.250
Big deal!

758
01:10:17.533 --> 01:10:19.869
- Al!
- Yeah?


759
01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:20.697
Come on.

760
01:10:26.143 --> 01:10:28.735
Alright, honey. 
Time to get up.

761
01:10:30.213 --> 01:10:33.647
- Let's go! Come on, come on!
- Come on, move it!


762
01:10:33.683 --> 01:10:34.411
Get up!

763
01:10:36.853 --> 01:10:37.615
Dead?

764
01:10:39.388 --> 01:10:42.016
Must have died from the
exhaust, or... suicide!


765
01:10:43.092 --> 01:10:45.859
Couldn't be any cleaner
than that now, could ya?


766
01:10:46.762 --> 01:10:49.410
Get that plastic man, we'll bury
her out back before sun-up.


767
01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:50.950
Alright, come on, let's go.

768
01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:55.150
- Got it?
- Yeah.


769
01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:02.751
- Jesus!
- Goddamn!


770
01:11:03.412 --> 01:11:04.749
Scared me to <i>death!</i>

771
01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:09.150
Let me do her, Red.
I'll cut her head off, right now.


772
01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:10.553
Warren, you in there?

773
01:11:10.553 --> 01:11:12.450
Shh, it's my wife. Come on.

774
01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:14.378
Cover her up, quick.
Put her in the freezer.


775
01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:15.378
Warren?

776
01:11:15.478 --> 01:11:17.478
- Warren!
- Be right there, Arleen.


777
01:11:34.478 --> 01:11:37.002
Hey... she's a feisty one, ain't she?

778
01:11:40.102 --> 01:11:42.594
That's right, lady!
You just keep it up.


779
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:53.329
Alright, don't give
me any trouble.


780
01:11:53.429 --> 01:11:56.332
Godammit! Cut your
fucking squirming!


781
01:11:56.432 --> 01:11:59.135
Aww, come on, baby. It's not
as bad as it sounds.


782
01:11:59.235 --> 01:12:01.602
Take take you about ten minutes
to suck all that air out.


783
01:12:01.702 --> 01:12:02.813
Probably won't even feel it!

784
01:12:02.913 --> 01:12:03.813
Ha, ha, ha.

785
01:12:10.913 --> 01:12:12.854
Come on, fellas.
Come on.


786
01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.854
Breakfast's burning, dude.

787
01:12:17.954 --> 01:12:19.801
- Let's go eat!
- Glad to.


788
01:12:30.901 --> 01:12:32.833
- Well.
- Hey, Mrs. C.


789
01:12:32.868 --> 01:12:35.504
Finally. Are you coming
to breakfast?


790
01:12:35.504 --> 01:12:36.334
I've been calling you.

791
01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:38.336
Yeah, we sure could use
some of them pancakes.


792
01:13:11.436 --> 01:13:13.850
Hey Billy... now come
in the house!


793
01:15:05.749 --> 01:15:06.994
So what happens?

794
01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:09.751
This rooster. Must've
been huge.


795
01:15:09.751 --> 01:15:11.600
They must've weighed
about ten pounds.


796
01:15:12.094 --> 01:15:15.672
He starts reaching out...
to the highway patrolman.


797
01:15:15.772 --> 01:15:16.672
Yeah.

798
01:15:16.772 --> 01:15:18.772
Reaches way out
from the...


799
01:15:22.772 --> 01:15:23.602
Give me the key.

800
01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:26.564
Mister...

801
01:15:26.675 --> 01:15:29.078
Don't 'mister' me you
son-of-a-bitch!


802
01:15:29.178 --> 01:15:32.204
My wife is locked up in a hole
in your fucking barn!


803
01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:34.419
And if you don't give
me the key...


804
01:15:34.519 --> 01:15:36.619
I'm gonna blow your
<i>fucking head off!</i>


805
01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:37.543
Warren, what's going on?

806
01:15:37.751 --> 01:15:39.822
I don't know, Honey.
Just stay calm.


807
01:15:39.822 --> 01:15:42.150
Your husband's a murderer and a
kidnapper, what's going on.


808
01:15:42.150 --> 01:15:44.393
Now give me the fucking key!

809
01:15:44.493 --> 01:15:45.323
Freeze, Mister.

810
01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:54.140
You don't wanna do that, kid.

811
01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.040
Put the gun down.

812
01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.140
Don't listen to him, Deke.

813
01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.144
You just keep that gun
right on him.


814
01:16:02.244 --> 01:16:04.914
My daddy keeps his rifle
loaded all the time.


815
01:16:05.014 --> 01:16:07.850
He showed me in case I need to
protect Mommy when he's away.


816
01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:09.618
I understand that and I'm
not going to hurt your mom.


817
01:16:09.718 --> 01:16:10.616
He's lying, Deke.

818
01:16:12.254 --> 01:16:13.221
Now, go on, Son.

819
01:16:15.124 --> 01:16:16.523
Squeeze that trigger, go on.

820
01:16:17.827 --> 01:16:18.987
Don't listen to him, kid.

821
01:16:19.261 --> 01:16:20.057
Go on, Deke.

822
01:16:20.196 --> 01:16:21.931
Don't listen to him.
He's wrong.


823
01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:23.767
Do what I tell you to do.
Squeeze that trigger now.


824
01:16:23.867 --> 01:16:24.867
Come on!

825
01:16:24.867 --> 01:16:27.939
Put it down, Deke.
Nothing's gonna happen.


826
01:16:30.039 --> 01:16:30.471
Do it!

827
01:16:32.571 --> 01:16:33.811
Arrgh! Goddamn!

828
01:16:35.911 --> 01:16:36.878
<i>Don't</i> move.

829
01:16:40.082 --> 01:16:40.980
Nobody move!

830
01:16:42.751 --> 01:16:43.752
Get down here, kid.

831
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:46.991
- Get over here... get by your mom.
- Come here, Honey.


832
01:16:47.091 --> 01:16:48.891
It's alright.

833
01:16:48.991 --> 01:16:49.788
Get over there.

834
01:16:49.888 --> 01:16:51.962
Get over there!

835
01:16:53.062 --> 01:16:53.687
Shit!

836
01:16:56.787 --> 01:16:58.835
Alright.

837
01:16:59.935 --> 01:17:01.571
Everybody stick together
and get out that door!


838
01:17:01.749 --> 01:17:03.195
Right now! Move it!

839
01:17:03.295 --> 01:17:05.441
- Go! Get outta here! Move it!
- Come on, Honey. Let's go.


840
01:17:05.441 --> 01:17:08.773
Turn around! <i>Turn a-round!</i>

841
01:17:13.983 --> 01:17:14.540
Open it!

842
01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.150
Get down there,
open that freezer up.


843
01:17:32.568 --> 01:17:34.399
Warren... what is this?

844
01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:37.294
Just pull the chain, Arleen.

845
01:17:43.412 --> 01:17:43.935
Open it!

846
01:17:50.419 --> 01:17:53.183
You'd better pray... she's alive.

847
01:17:57.283 --> 01:17:58.762
Ohh!

848
01:17:59.862 --> 01:18:00.453
Amy.

849
01:18:02.064 --> 01:18:02.749
Jeff.

850
01:18:05.701 --> 01:18:08.137
You made it, baby.
Come on.


851
01:18:08.237 --> 01:18:09.204
Get away from me!

852
01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:13.015
Come on, honey.
Come on up.


853
01:18:13.115 --> 01:18:14.015
Come on, honey.

854
01:18:16.115 --> 01:18:17.015
It's alright.

855
01:18:20.115 --> 01:18:22.718
Alright, you son-of-a-bitch.
Get down there!


856
01:18:22.818 --> 01:18:23.842
All of you. Get down there!

857
01:18:25.942 --> 01:18:26.761
It's ok.

858
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:32.350
Ok, it's alright.

859
01:18:32.861 --> 01:18:34.431
You <i>better</i> remember
this, fella...


860
01:18:34.531 --> 01:18:36.657
- 'Cos no matter where you go...
- You... <i>FUCK!!</i>


861
01:18:36.757 --> 01:18:38.177
Uggh!

862
01:18:46.277 --> 01:18:47.177
Jeff!

863
01:18:48.277 --> 01:18:50.006
It's alright. It's alright.

864
01:18:50.546 --> 01:18:52.750
Now listen to me.
Amy, listen to me.


865
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:53.750
Honey, listen to me.

866
01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:56.749
There's one more still
out there, you understand?


867
01:18:58.687 --> 01:19:01.169
Now we have to get
out of here, fast!


868
01:19:14.269 --> 01:19:14.826
Shit!

869
01:19:26.949 --> 01:19:29.353
Can you make it to that
pickup truck?


870
01:19:30.453 --> 01:19:31.353
Ok.

871
01:19:31.453 --> 01:19:32.353
Come on.

872
01:19:54.453 --> 01:19:57.453
Ok. Ok, come on.

873
01:19:57.553 --> 01:19:59.168
- Help!
- Billy!


874
01:19:59.168 --> 01:20:00.168
Billy?!

875
01:20:00.749 --> 01:20:01.600
Hang on!

876
01:20:09.268 --> 01:20:11.968
- We gotta find those keys.
- Ok.


877
01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:20.831
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Taylor.
This is an emergency.


878
01:20:20.931 --> 01:20:22.704
Listen to me, I need
the police.


879
01:20:22.704 --> 01:20:25.641
Someone's trying to kill me and
my wife. Do you understand?


880
01:20:25.741 --> 01:20:28.233
I don't know the address.
We're on a farm.


881
01:20:29.144 --> 01:20:31.575
Just... start tracing
this call, right now!


882
01:20:32.981 --> 01:20:34.470
Got 'em!

883
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:40.364
- Jeff!
- Get away!


884
01:20:48.749 --> 01:20:49.089
Come on.

885
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:51.502
Come on!

886
01:20:53.602 --> 01:20:54.466
Give me the keys!

887
01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:03.749
Jeff!

888
01:21:06.849 --> 01:21:07.440
Come on!

889
01:21:09.585 --> 01:21:10.176
Go!!

890
01:21:28.804 --> 01:21:30.361
Do you see him?

891
01:21:30.706 --> 01:21:32.331
- Do you see him?!
- No!


892
01:21:44.753 --> 01:21:46.700
- Are you alright?
- Yes!


893
01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.800
- Look out!
- Damn!


894
01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.749
Want some? Come on!

895
01:22:03.696 --> 01:22:04.164
Damn!

896
01:22:23.751 --> 01:22:25.164
Shit!

897
01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:27.950
I can't... oh...

898
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:29.696
- Watch out!
- Hang on!


899
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:39.951
Fuck!

900
01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:44.951
Crazy bastard!

901
01:22:46.051 --> 01:22:48.951
Fucker... you're gonna die!

902
01:22:57.051 --> 01:22:57.951
Oh God!

903
01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:12.951
Jeff!

904
01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:23.676
Shit!

905
01:23:24.776 --> 01:23:26.676
I'm out.

906
01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:45.250
Jesus!

907
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:46.676
Oh, Jeff!

908
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:52.853
Jesus!

909
01:23:52.953 --> 01:23:55.953
No! No! Arrgh!

910
01:23:59.053 --> 01:24:00.053
Stop!

911
01:24:08.153 --> 01:24:09.153
Don't. Jeff!

912
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:17.693
- No, I can't get out!
- Gotta get outta here!


913
01:24:17.793 --> 01:24:18.850
I can't get out!

914
01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:19.550
Oh!

915
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:20.693
Oh, I can't get out!

916
01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:46.693
Arrgh, my leg!

917
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:54.693
Arrrgh!!

918
01:24:54.793 --> 01:24:55.850
No!

919
01:26:46.793 --> 01:26:48.693
Jeff.

920
01:26:51.793 --> 01:26:52.316
Don't move.

921
01:26:52.961 --> 01:26:53.518
Don't move.

922
01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:06.939
Gonna get you out now.

923
01:27:09.211 --> 01:27:11.984
Come here. Come on.
Come on. Alright.


924
01:27:12.084 --> 01:27:13.984
We're gonna do this.

925
01:27:16.084 --> 01:27:18.346
Pull! Pull!

926
01:27:18.346 --> 01:27:19.480
Watch it, come on!

01:27:19.821 --> 01:27:20.480
Pull!

Come on!

929
01:27:29.731 --> 01:27:31.751
- You alright?
- Yeah.
