So, you were walking in circles?

358

No. I tied a scarf
around the tree.

And when I came back around,
it was gone.

on the trees.

you were in some strange

would be hard for you.

Honestly, I don't really know.

495
00:39:44.028 --> 00:39:45.828
But I have some thoughts.

496
00:39:58.008 --> 00:40:00.477
You see here?

497
00:40:00.577 --> 00:40:02.746
This is your original space.

498
00:40:02.845 --> 00:40:06.450
And you think of the walls,
the squares,


499
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.653
like a ripple in time.

500
00:40:09.753 --> 00:40:13.190
Now these areas
are where the spaces meet.


501
00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.060
Now the place that we met,
we call that the nucleus.


502
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.128
That's where the ripples
are held together.


503
00:40:18.228 --> 00:40:21.465
Once you cross over,
you're in another space


504
00:40:21.565 --> 00:40:24.101
with another version of you.

505
00:40:24.201 --> 00:40:27.204
The paradox is that
we can't coexist in a space


506
00:40:27.304 --> 00:40:30.374
that's already occupied
by another version of ourselves.


507
00:40:30.474 --> 00:40:31.809
None of this makes sense.

508
00:40:31.908 --> 00:40:33.711
We have multiple worlds,

509
00:40:33.811 --> 00:40:35.878
and yet we can move
between the worlds,


510
00:40:35.979 --> 00:40:38.248
but we're stuck.

511
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:39.483
For now.

512
00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:43.554
I haven't worked out the whole
time loop thing yet.


513
00:40:46.623 --> 00:40:48.325

514
00:40:49.993 --> 00:40:52.429
Well, it's kind of my job.

516

dark matter, cosmic rays,


517
00:40:58.502 --> 00:41:00.270

518
00:41:03.807 --> 00:41:05.509
I gotta ask.

519
00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:07.611
What am I like in your world?

520
00:41:11.448 --> 00:41:12.983

521
00:41:14.017 --> 00:41:15.986

-Hmm.

523

It's honest work.

528
00:41:47.718 --> 00:41:49.119
What?

529
00:41:49.219 --> 00:41:53.457
I just,
I always used to tell my Alex


530
00:41:53.557 --> 00:41:57.261
that he should work
a little harder for his PhD.


531
00:41:58.729 --> 00:42:02.199
Oh, and he would have spent
too much time away from you.


532
00:42:04.001 --> 00:42:06.303
I think he made
the right choice.

Everything I could have asked
for in a life.


536
00:42:24.254 --> 00:42:28.158
When my Vanessa left me, we, uh,

537
00:42:28.258 --> 00:42:31.061
we never got back on track.

538
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:33.230
The loss of Obe was just.

539
00:42:35.265 --> 00:42:37.734
Don't say his name. Please.

540
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.239
She couldn't say
his name either.


541
00:42:43.106 --> 00:42:45.309
Thought it would just,
you know, help her move on,


542
00:42:45.409 --> 00:42:46.577
but,

543
00:42:47.911 --> 00:42:50.514
just took a deeper dive
into depression.


544
00:42:52.883 --> 00:42:55.085
Came out here to get away
from it all.


545
00:42:56.186 --> 00:43:01.124
Then she started seeing
strange things, that, uh,


546
00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:05.062
there are people like her
walking around.


547
00:43:07.898 --> 00:43:10.200
You know, I always held on
to the hope


548
00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.404
that I'd see her again one day,
but every time I did,


549
00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:20.677
you all had pieces of her,
but you weren't my Vanessa.


550
00:43:24.781 --> 00:43:26.450
I'm not giving up, though.

551
00:43:27.317 --> 00:43:29.486
Not giving up till I find her.

552
00:43:31.655 --> 00:43:35.325
I have one more question.

553
00:43:36.126 --> 00:43:37.561
DIVORCED ALEX:
Yeah?


554
00:43:41.231 --> 00:43:43.400
Is there a chance he's alive?

555
00:43:45.335 --> 00:43:48.105
I searched for him, too.

556
00:43:49.406 --> 00:43:50.507
Every space I've been to,

557
00:43:50.607 --> 00:43:54.344
he's either dead
or he never existed.


558
00:43:55.612 --> 00:43:58.081
Maybe you haven't looked
hard enough.


559
00:44:04.388 --> 00:44:08.191
You know, I may be able
to get you back


560

It's a long shot,

562
00:44:11.695 --> 00:44:15.632
but I've never had anyone else
to test my theory.


563
00:44:16.567 --> 00:44:17.768
What is it?

564
00:44:19.269 --> 00:44:21.271
Fishing wire.

565
00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:23.307

567
00:44:27.377 --> 00:44:28.679
and I take the other end

568
00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:31.916
into the forest with me,
hopefully when I return,


569
00:44:32.016 --> 00:44:34.651
I can get back
to the exact same spot


570
00:44:34.751 --> 00:44:36.286
that I left.

571
00:44:36.386 --> 00:44:39.057
I think I could help us find

some more wire.

01:20:29.272 --> 01:20:32.442
My mom used to say that,
dead bird meant


987
01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:35.445
the closing of one chapter
in your life


988
01:20:35.545 --> 01:20:37.748
and the beginning of a new one.

989
01:20:37.848 --> 01:20:39.683
Maybe this is a sign.

990
01:20:42.285 --> 01:20:43.687
Yeah?

991
01:20:45.288 --> 01:20:46.656
Of what?

01:20:48.792 --> 01:20:54.664
(♪)

993
01:20:54.765 --> 01:20:56.800
A new beginning.

994
01:21:16.319 --> 01:21:18.789
Hey, you hungry?

995
01:21:18.889 --> 01:21:20.390
Mm-hmm.

996
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:21.424
Go on make me some food then.

997
01:21:21.525 --> 01:21:23.560
I'm playing. I'm playing.

998
01:21:25.328 --> 01:21:26.630
Hey.

999
01:21:28.565 --> 01:21:30.467
Don't stay out here too long.

1000
01:21:30.567 --> 01:21:32.003
You know I love you, right?

1001
01:21:34.805 --> 01:21:37.574
Yeah. I... I do.

1002
01:21:38.642 --> 01:21:40.744
And you can tell me anything?

1003
01:21:44.148 --> 01:21:45.649
I know.

1004
01:21:48.286 --> 01:21:50.121
Okay.

1005
01:21:50.221 --> 01:21:52.522
I tried to wake you
when we got back.


1006
01:21:52.622 --> 01:21:56.027
Yeah, I was really tired.

1007
01:21:57.028 --> 01:21:58.328
How long was I out?

1008
01:21:58.428 --> 01:22:00.630
You slept for 13 hours.

1009
01:22:02.099 --> 01:22:04.734
Vanessa, you're finally up.

1010
01:22:04.835 --> 01:22:05.970
Hey.

1011
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:07.571
I thought we were going
to have to call 9-1-1.


1012
01:22:07.671 --> 01:22:08.738
You sleep like a rock.

You good?


1015
01:22:11.441 --> 01:22:13.844
Yeah. Better than good.

1016
01:22:14.845 --> 01:22:16.346
How's your hand?

1017
01:22:18.648 --> 01:22:20.584
It's not as bad as we thought.

1018
01:22:27.657 --> 01:22:28.758
-You want to go for a hike?
-No.


1019
01:22:28.859 --> 01:22:30.827
No.

1020
01:22:30.928 --> 01:22:34.265
No, just want to relax.

1021
01:22:34.364 --> 01:22:35.799
All right.

1022
01:22:35.899 --> 01:22:38.568
After that maybe we can get
a little quality alone time.


1023
01:22:38.668 --> 01:22:39.937
Oh, God. Come on, man.

-I'm going to get breakfast.
-What? It's fine.

Come on, man. Stop! (LAUGHS)

1026
01:22:43.673 --> 01:22:45.609
I don't need to know all that.

1027
01:22:49.679 --> 01:22:52.649
I'm going to go get dressed.

1028
01:22:54.818 --> 01:22:57.587
Let me go help this fool
in the kitchen.


1029
