goofing around.

Three weeks later,


53
00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.603
I was conceived in the
back of that Plymouth.

I was thinking a lot

Well, I'm kind of like
Spock in that episode


96
00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:15.581
where he tells the replicants

97

that everything he
says is a lie.


98
00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.919

you say is a lie,

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:44.563
- What's that?

163
00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:45.439
- Tennessee.

164
00:07:46.774 --> 00:07:48.525
I'm just whoever I
pretend to be.


165
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.528
You ever feel like that?

166
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.530
Like all you are is the
person you were pretending


167
00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:54.615
to be in high school?

168
00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:56.283
- Uh,

169
00:07:57.534 --> 00:07:58.368
no.

170
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.330
But don't worry, you
are somebody.


171
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:04.124
If you'd stop pretending,
it'll come out all by itself.


172
00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:06.919
- Do you want to get married?

173
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.795
- No.

174
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.133
- I don't want to be an actor.

175
00:08:13.175 --> 00:08:14.968
It's a little disappointing
when your best quality


176
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.720
is pretending to be
someone else.


177
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.058
I want to be somebody specific,
you know?


178
00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.478
I was born in Texas.

179
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.939
But I left there when
I was eight.


180
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.816
And sometimes, I think
if I had just stayed,


181
00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:32.236
I could be a regular person,
you know?


182
00:08:32.276 --> 00:08:34.154
Billy, the lumber guy,
or whatever.


183
00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:36.990
Instead of running around
with my head cut off.


184
00:08:37.032 --> 00:08:38.242
- Why'd you leave Texas?

185
00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.160
- My mom had wanderlust.

186
00:08:42.078 --> 00:08:43.163
- What about your dad?

187
00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:45.457
- I don't really know him.

188
00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.254
- Don't smoke that.

189
00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:51.130
- Why not?

190
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:54.758
- Because I'm thinking
about kissing you.


191
00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:56.802
- Okay.

192
00:08:57.928 --> 00:08:59.388
Good to know.

193
00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:00.347
It's good to know.

194
00:09:04.101 --> 00:09:06.812
- [Sarah] So you're gonna
be a big movie star, huh?


195
00:09:06.854 --> 00:09:08.647
- [William] Yeah,
it's my destiny.


196
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.693
- [Sarah] (laughs) God,
you're unbelievable.


197
00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:14.486
- [William] I try to be.

198
00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:16.613
Born yesterday, but I
stayed up all night.


199
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:19.908
- This is my door.

200
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:23.245
- You live here?

201
00:09:24.538 --> 00:09:25.914
- [Sarah] Yeah.

202
00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:27.332
- No shit, really?

203
00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:32.171
- That's my window.
(Sarah laughs)


204
00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:34.673
My window looks out on
your front door.


205
00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:39.052
- Well, I just got to
New York City tonight.


206
00:09:39.094 --> 00:09:40.137
I'm staying with a friend.

207
00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.513
- Come here, come here,
come here.


208
00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:42.931
Do me a favor, stand right here.

209
00:09:42.973 --> 00:09:43.807
- Okay.

210
00:09:44.725 --> 00:09:45.726
- Right there, just like that.

211
00:09:45.767 --> 00:09:46.560
- Why?

212
00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:47.477
- That's good, one second.

213
00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:49.771
- I feel weird.

214
00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.274
(laughs) What am I doing here?

215
00:09:55.736 --> 00:09:57.613
What?

216
00:09:57.654 --> 00:09:59.656
(mellow music)

217
00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:02.951
(Sarah laughs)

218
00:10:02.993 --> 00:10:05.662
(mellow music)

219
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.734
- [William Voiceover] Looking
out at what was now her door,


220
00:10:35.776 --> 00:10:38.904
I had the profound feeling
that my life had changed.


221
00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:41.949
And I was right,

222
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.243
not in the way I had thought.

223
00:10:44.284 --> 00:10:47.454
I hadn't met the woman
I was to grow gray with.


224
00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:50.916
I was 20 years old, and
by the time I was 21,


225
00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.502
I'd be heartbroken.

226
00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:57.339
(mellow music)

227
00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:12.062
- [Sarah] Hi.

228
00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.188
- [William] Nice to see you.

229
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.356
What's your name again?

230
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.067
- You don't remember my name?

231
00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:17.943
- I'm kidding.

232
00:11:20.195 --> 00:11:21.697
- Oh my God, did I do that?

233
00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:22.572
- [William] Yeah.

234
00:11:23.907 --> 00:11:24.992
- Are you mad?

235
00:11:25.993 --> 00:11:27.452
- No.

236
00:11:27.494 --> 00:11:28.996
- Do you do that all the time?

237
00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:31.957
- [William] Do what?

238
00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:34.626
- Kiss girls.

239
00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:35.919
- Hey Sarah, we're gonna
start in about


240
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:37.421
10 minutes, alright?

241
00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:44.386
Is she okay?

242
00:11:44.428 --> 00:11:46.263
- I think something's
wrong with her microphone.


243
00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.724
- [Dave] I'll get it.

244
00:11:48.765 --> 00:11:50.267
- [William] Hey Sarah?

245
00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:53.186
That dude said he'd take care
of the microphone business.


246
00:11:55.772 --> 00:11:57.190
What?
- Come here.


247
00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:00.485
I'm behaving ridiculously.

248
00:12:00.527 --> 00:12:01.737
- [William] Yeah, you are.

249
00:12:01.778 --> 00:12:03.113
- [Sarah] I'm sorry
about the hickey thing.


250
00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:04.489
- [William] It's A-okay.

251
00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:06.325
- [Sarah] Hmm.

252
00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:11.371
(heavy breathing)
(kissing)


253
00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:16.793
I should go now.

254
00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.253
- [William] Okay.

255
00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:20.922
Good luck.

256
00:12:20.964 --> 00:12:22.007
- Okay.

257
00:12:22.049 --> 00:12:23.091
- [William] Just pretend
you're someone else.


258
00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:24.676
- What?

259
00:12:24.718 --> 00:12:26.678
- Think of your favorite singer,

260
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.139
and just start out by
pretending to be her.


261
00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:31.641
The rest'll come easy,
and it'll secretly be you.


262
00:12:34.102 --> 00:12:35.395
- Can I borrow your jacket?

263
00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:38.440
- Uh.

264
00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:45.822
- Come on buddy, take
off your jacket.


265
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:49.618
Come on, it's hot as
hell in here, man.


266
00:12:54.623 --> 00:12:56.416
Come on buddy, take
off your jacket.


267
00:12:58.543 --> 00:13:01.296
Now listen to me, William,
your mother and you


268
00:13:01.338 --> 00:13:02.297
are moving away.

269
00:13:03.423 --> 00:13:04.758
And I can't come after you.

270
00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:06.468
I can't,

271
00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:09.554
because I can't.

272
00:13:09.596 --> 00:13:11.306
You know I'm going to try
to get some money together


273
00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:13.809
and visit you as much as I can,

274
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.853
but it won't be as often
as I want, all right?


275
00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:24.403
But it's killing me, all right?

276
00:13:24.444 --> 00:13:27.948
I mean, it's, it's
really killing me.


277
00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:31.368
And I want you to
remember one thing.


278
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.994
(train whistle blows)

279
00:13:33.036 --> 00:13:33.870
Can you hear me?

280
00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:39.292
Just remember one thing.

281
00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:42.712
I am not the one leaving Texas,
all right?


282
00:13:44.172 --> 00:13:45.340
Will you remember that?

283
00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:52.931
Come on, take off your jacket.

284
00:13:54.307 --> 00:13:56.893
(mellow music)

285
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.985
♪ Some time when we
meet up yonder ♪


286
00:14:06.987 --> 00:14:11.992

(applause)

291
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.306
- That's my jacket.

292
00:14:37.767 --> 00:14:38.852
You know what I'm gonna do?

293
00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:41.188
I'm gonna buy a car, an
old silver one


294
00:14:41.229 --> 00:14:45.567
with a big dashboard, and
drive you down to Nashville.


295
00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:47.235
Take you to the Grand Ole Opry,

296
00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:49.738
and make you a big
motherfucking star.


297
00:14:50.572 --> 00:14:52.324
- Can I sing Johnny Cash?

298
00:14:52.365 --> 00:14:53.283
- Are you kidding?

299
00:14:55.076 --> 00:14:56.453
Why don't you move in with me?

300
00:14:57.621 --> 00:14:59.623
- I came to New York to
be on my own.


301
00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:00.999
- I'll move out.

302
00:15:02.209 --> 00:15:03.043
Sorry.

303
00:15:05.962 --> 00:15:07.672
- I found my own place.

304
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:12.969
But I'll stay with you until
my lease starts, if you want.


305
00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:14.429
- I want.

306
00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:16.097
Yeah, it'll be good.

307
00:15:17.557 --> 00:15:19.768
- But I won't have sex with you.

308
00:15:19.809 --> 00:15:20.644
- Why not?

309
00:15:22.229 --> 00:15:24.564
- Because I have a
scar right here.


310
00:15:24.606 --> 00:15:25.774
- That's okay.

311
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:27.859
I got lots of scars.

312
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.447
- Okay, then I'll sleep over.

313
00:15:35.116 --> 00:15:36.576
- [William] But you
won't have sex with me.


314
00:15:36.618 --> 00:15:37.661
- [Sarah] I'll have sex with you

315
00:15:37.702 --> 00:15:39.704
when I have my own apartment.

316
00:15:39.746 --> 00:15:41.414
- [William] So it's kind
of like an audition?


317
00:15:41.456 --> 00:15:42.707
- [Sarah] Yeah.

318
00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:46.002
- [William] I hope I
get a callback.


319
00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:48.630
(Sarah laughs)

320
00:15:52.092 --> 00:15:54.469
- [William Voiceover] It
was Wednesday when we met,


321
00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:57.389
Saturday when I asked
her to move in,


322
00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.809
and by Sunday there were
flowers in my apartment,


323
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.519
and hummus in my refrigerator.

324
00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:05.647
I don't remember waking
up that Sunday.


325
00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:07.983
I don't think I ever slept.

326
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.194
I just sat there thinking,

327
00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.112
God damn,

328
00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:16.866
this must be what
praying is like.


329
00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:19.911
(slow guitar music)

330
00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:27.335
(Sarah singing in
foreign language)


331
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:37.345
- [William] All right, ma'am,
where would you like this?


332
00:16:38.763 --> 00:16:43.393
- Yay.

333
00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.312
(squeals)

334
00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:46.354
You really got that part?

335
00:16:46.396 --> 00:16:48.398
- I really did.

336
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.191
- You're really gonna
be in a movie.


337
00:16:50.233 --> 00:16:51.318
That's awesome.

338
00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:53.778
- Yeah, we leave for
Mexico in a month.


339
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.739
That's where we're shootin' it.

340
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.782
- Oh cool, Mexico.

341
00:16:57.824 --> 00:16:59.409
That sounds like fun.

342
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:00.827
You know what we should do?

343
00:17:02.078 --> 00:17:03.788
We should paint.

344
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.332
- [William] Aren't you sleepy?

345
00:17:05.373 --> 00:17:06.916
- [Sarah] No, I think
we should paint.


346
00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.293
- [William] Alright.

347
00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:11.254
(woman singing in
foreign language)


348
00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:13.840
- Well, what do you want to do?

349
00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:16.843
- You know what I want to do.

350
00:17:16.884 --> 00:17:18.762
But painting's okay.

351
00:17:18.803 --> 00:17:23.224
(woman singing in
foreign language)


352
00:17:24.225 --> 00:17:25.768
What's your shirt say?

353
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:26.645
- Oh.

354
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.981
I love to fuck.

355
00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:35.737
(woman singing in
foreign language)


356
00:17:40.116 --> 00:17:41.368
Does that make you feel tough?

357
00:17:41.409 --> 00:17:42.744
- It does.

358
00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:46.414
- Well, you better get
serious about your painting,


359
00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:48.166
because we're not gonna
go to bed tonight


360
00:17:48.208 --> 00:17:51.044
'til this whole
apartment is blue.


361
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.130
You're the type of boy
who gets girls pregnant.


362
00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:55.548
Do you know that?

363
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.593
- Yeah, my mother used
to say that all the time.


364
00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:06.518
- [Sarah] You should think
of me as very fragile.


365
00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:09.270
I just didn't want to be
feeling this way right now.


366
00:18:09.312 --> 00:18:10.605
- [William] How do you feel?

367
00:18:11.564 --> 00:18:13.608
- [Sarah] Don't play dumb.

368
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.901
I'm here to be on my own.

369
00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:20.156
I'll probably just run
away and leave you crushed.


370
00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:23.493
- [William] Nah, you
can't hurt me.


371
00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:24.869
That's the problem.

372
00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:27.622
You just got to stick
around and hear the jokes.


373
00:18:27.664 --> 00:18:28.707
- [Sarah] Oh brother.

374
00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:33.086
(mellow music)

375
00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:39.634
(Sarah sings in
foreign language)


376
00:18:51.354 --> 00:18:52.814
- [William] Do you know
how dumb I feel?


377
00:18:52.856 --> 00:18:54.649
- [Sarah] What do you mean?

378
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:57.193
- [William] When you're
thinking about sex like 24 hours


379
00:18:57.235 --> 00:19:01.114
a day, it significantly
deteriorates your intelligence.


380
00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:02.824
(fake cries)

381
00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:03.700
- [Sarah] You know what?

382
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.954
We should have done it
that first night.


383
00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:10.665
That first night we kissed,
I wanted to sleep with you.


384
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.460
You're just giving me
too much time to think.


385
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.295
- I didn't think it was
gonna be a one shot deal.


386
00:19:15.336 --> 00:19:16.212
- Oh, come on.

387
00:19:18.298 --> 00:19:19.632
- When's it gonna get ugly?

388
00:19:21.009 --> 00:19:22.427
When's it gonna get abusive?

389
00:19:24.804 --> 00:19:26.264
- I don't know, but
it always does.


390
00:19:27.182 --> 00:19:28.641
- What kind of shit do you
think we'll say


391
00:19:28.683 --> 00:19:30.435
about each other
after we break up?


392
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:32.771
- Frigid bitch.

393
00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:35.315
- All he thinks
about is himself.


394
00:19:36.399 --> 00:19:38.485
- She's really still
just a child.


395
00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:39.611
- He doesn't ever listen.

396
00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:42.322
- Oh, she's completely
without talent.


397
00:19:42.363 --> 00:19:44.115
- Oh, he calls himself an actor?

398
00:19:44.157 --> 00:19:47.410
What a phoney.
(Sarah laughs)


399
00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:49.204
Isn't it strange that'll happen?

400
00:19:50.997 --> 00:19:52.373
I'll come in here one night,

401
00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:56.920
"Listen, we got to talk".

402
00:19:58.505 --> 00:19:59.547
- What is it?

403
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:01.049
- It's just I've been
thinking and--


404
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.966
- And what?

405
00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:04.385
- I just need a little
space is all.


406
00:20:04.427 --> 00:20:05.720
- Space for what?

407
00:20:05.762 --> 00:20:08.348
- Look, don't make this
any harder than it is.


408
00:20:08.389 --> 00:20:10.350
I don't make you happy,
you don't make me happy.


409
00:20:10.391 --> 00:20:12.685
- Yes, yes, you do.

410
00:20:12.727 --> 00:20:14.813
We can work this out,
I love you.


411
00:20:15.772 --> 00:20:16.981
You're seeing someone else.

412
00:20:17.023 --> 00:20:18.191
- No, don't say that, it
doesn't matter.


413
00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:19.442
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter.


414
00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:20.318
- Who is it?

415
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.528
- See, I can't even talk to you.

416
00:20:21.569 --> 00:20:22.654
- Who is it, who is it?

417
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.199
I always knew you didn't
care about me.


418
00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:28.076
You just needed
someone to talk at.


419
00:20:29.202 --> 00:20:31.496
I could have been any girl.

420
00:20:31.538 --> 00:20:34.499
- Now, don't go feeling
sorry for yourself.


421
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:36.709
The point is, it's over.

422
00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:40.338
It was fun, but I'm just not
boyfriend material, you know?


423
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:43.591
- Okay.

424
00:20:43.633 --> 00:20:45.844
I think we have to
stop now because,


425
00:20:45.885 --> 00:20:48.096
oh my God, I'm so stupid.

426
00:20:48.137 --> 00:20:49.639
I'm so stupid.

427
00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.808
I can't do this with you.

428
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.559
- We were joking.

429
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.476
- [Sarah] I can't do that.

430
00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:54.519
- It was a dumb game.

431
00:20:54.561 --> 00:20:55.895
- [Sarah] I don't what
a boyfriend right now.


432
00:20:55.937 --> 00:20:56.896
- Don't start having some
self-fulfilling


433
00:20:56.938 --> 00:20:58.314
prophecy that I'm
gonna hurt you.


434
00:20:58.356 --> 00:20:59.941
- [Sarah] I promised myself
I wasn't gonna do this.


435
00:21:01.442 --> 00:21:04.237
- Listen, if you could be
inside my body when I see you,


436
00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:06.489
or touch you, or think
that I might see you


437
00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:08.908
or touch you, you would
stop crying and slap me,


438
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.828
because I'm either crazy
about you, or I'm going crazy.


439
00:21:14.122 --> 00:21:15.498
- You are crazy.
- Oh yeah?


440
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.374
- Yeah.

441
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.377
- Well, if you don't say,
"I'm gonna to get over


442
00:21:19.419 --> 00:21:22.255
"my stupid hang-ups and
fall desperately in love",


443
00:21:23.464 --> 00:21:24.924
I'm gonna jump off this bed.

444
00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:26.009
- [Sarah] I'm not
gonna say that.


445
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:26.634
- Say it!

446
00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:29.888
- [Sarah] I don't have
any stupid hang-ups.


447
00:21:29.929 --> 00:21:31.973
- Oh, you better say it!

448
00:21:32.015 --> 00:21:33.892
- You know what, just,
just stop.


449
00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:36.102
- Ah. (grunts)

450
00:21:36.144 --> 00:21:37.061
Ah!

451
00:21:37.103 --> 00:21:38.605
- Are you okay?

452
00:21:38.646 --> 00:21:41.107
- (grunts) Say you're falling
desperately in love with me,


453
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:43.192
and I'll come back to life.

454
00:21:43.234 --> 00:21:44.444
- No.

455
00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:46.237
(William grunts)

456
00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:48.197
What do you even mean by love?

457
00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:49.866
- I'm dying.

458
00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:51.200
- You're not dying.

459
00:21:51.242 --> 00:21:53.202
- Say you desperately want
to kiss me passionately,


460
00:21:53.244 --> 00:21:54.579
and I'll come back to life.

461
00:21:58.416 --> 00:21:59.125
- Ah.

462
00:22:00.418 --> 00:22:04.088
I desperately want to
kiss you passionately.


463
00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:08.009
(laughs)

464
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:09.677
- A tragedy narrowly averted.

465
00:22:11.304 --> 00:22:12.972
- [Sarah] Come here.

466
00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:18.102
- [William Voiceover] I
knew what was happening.


467
00:22:18.144 --> 00:22:19.354
And it was nice,

468
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.732
but it wasn't what I wanted.

469
00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:25.109
(upbeat music)

470
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:28.905
- Yo Kilroy, you big boxing
bastard, get over here.


471
00:22:30.323 --> 00:22:32.867
- [Older Man] I remember
winning that, spring of '79.


472
00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:35.244
- I wasn't born yet.

473
00:22:35.286 --> 00:22:36.579
- Look, I'm not saying
you look bad.


474
00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:39.248
I'm just saying, I wish
you were wearing a dress.


475
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.459
I personally find you more
attractive in a dress.


476
00:22:41.501 --> 00:22:43.336
I'm not saying that to
be mean, but you asked.


477
00:22:43.378 --> 00:22:45.088
And yes, I wish you
were in a dress.


478
00:22:45.129 --> 00:22:46.798
- I felt like wearing
jeans tonight.


479
00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:48.049
- [Decker] So wear jeans.

480
00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:49.801
- [Kim] Do you want me
to go home and change?


481
00:22:49.842 --> 00:22:51.886
- [Decker] Would I prefer that,
yes.


482
00:22:51.928 --> 00:22:53.513
- You are such a shit.

483
00:22:54.847 --> 00:22:57.141
I can't believe you're
friends with him.


484
00:22:58.851 --> 00:23:00.353
- Hey man, you went out
with her first.


485
00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:02.188
- (laughs) Hey, this is Sarah.

486
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.065
- Oh hey, good to meet you.

487
00:23:04.107 --> 00:23:05.441
Don't judge me too quickly.

488
00:23:05.483 --> 00:23:07.110
My mother killed herself
when I was 12,


489
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:09.612
so I have a lot of
issues with women


490
00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.489
that I'm still trying
to work out.


491
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:13.449
But I also have some
positive attributes,


492
00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:15.952
unfortunately, none of which
will be revealed this evening


493
00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:17.787
because I am
extremely inebriated.


494
00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:18.871
- Alright, man.

495
00:23:18.913 --> 00:23:20.331
- Did your mother
really kill herself?


496
00:23:20.373 --> 00:23:22.417
- She was exactly like
Sylvia Plath,


497
00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:23.543
without the publishing contract.

498
00:23:23.584 --> 00:23:24.460
- All right.

499
00:23:24.502 --> 00:23:26.129
- I'm trying to make you laugh.

500
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.964
Alright, man, I got to
show you something.


501
00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:29.132
- Alright, it's alright.

502
00:23:29.173 --> 00:23:31.467
- What the hell are
we all doing?


503
00:23:31.509 --> 00:23:34.345
Why is nobody setting
themselves on fire?


504
00:23:34.387 --> 00:23:37.306
I would set myself on
fire, except you know,


505
00:23:37.348 --> 00:23:41.102
I don't think alleged President
George Bush deserves it.


506
00:23:41.144 --> 00:23:42.311
I don't think he deserves
my whole body.


507
00:23:42.353 --> 00:23:45.023
I think he deserves
one singed ball.


508
00:23:46.566 --> 00:23:50.028
- [Older Man] "Sagebush
Trail", 1933, you ever seen it?


509
00:23:50.069 --> 00:23:51.863
- [Drunk Man] Come on, kiss her.

510
00:23:52.655 --> 00:23:54.157
- [Older Man] I was
actually there when he died.


511
00:23:54.198 --> 00:23:55.450
- [Blonde Woman] You were there?

512
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:58.369
- Yeah, yeah, I'll
never forget it.


513
00:23:58.411 --> 00:23:59.829
Me and my buddy Danny,
we had just come


514
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:01.289
from a baseball game.

515
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.874
We're standing in line
at McDonald's,


516
00:24:02.915 --> 00:24:04.834
and there was this old guy,

517
00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:06.502
like right in line in
front of us.


518
00:24:06.544 --> 00:24:10.465
This old man, he was just
crying, just sobbing.


519
00:24:10.506 --> 00:24:14.135
I looked over at him, and
I said, "You okay, Mister?"


520
00:24:14.177 --> 00:24:16.471
He looked back at me, with
tears, and he was like,


521
00:24:16.512 --> 00:24:18.514
"Didn't you hear?

522
00:24:18.556 --> 00:24:19.974
"John Wayne died today."

523
00:24:20.808 --> 00:24:21.809
- [Blonde Woman] Yeah?

524
00:24:21.851 --> 00:24:23.686
- John Wayne had died.

525
00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:25.980
It wasn't some numbnut, it
was John Wayne.


526
00:24:26.022 --> 00:24:27.899
- Well, I'm a vegetarian.

527
00:24:29.192 --> 00:24:30.943
- [Older Man] Actually,
I'm thinking about


528
00:24:30.985 --> 00:24:31.986
being a vegetarian.

529
00:24:32.028 --> 00:24:33.696
- I'm Samantha.
- Hi.


530
00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:36.574
- So, are you
William's girlfriend?


531
00:24:36.616 --> 00:24:38.951
- Um, I guess.

532
00:24:38.993 --> 00:24:40.411
I mean, we're just friends.

533
00:24:40.453 --> 00:24:41.329
- [Samantha] Cool.

534
00:24:42.121 --> 00:24:43.122
Where are you from?

535
00:24:43.164 --> 00:24:45.500
Your accent is just
so beguiling.


536
00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:46.501
- Thank you.

537
00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:49.170
Did you guys used to go out?

538
00:24:49.212 --> 00:24:51.380
- Oh yeah we did, but
it was ages ago.


539
00:24:51.422 --> 00:24:53.049
- Yeah, hmm.
- We're just friends now.


540
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:54.050
So what do you do?

541
00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:55.968
I'm in college, I go
to Columbia.


542
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.095
- Good.

543
00:24:57.136 --> 00:24:58.930
I want to be a singer.

544
00:24:58.971 --> 00:24:59.889
- Nice.
- Nice, yeah.


545
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.224
- Yeah.

546
00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:04.018
- But I guess as far as
a job, I'm babysitting.


547
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.646
- Oh, that's great,
like a nanny.


548
00:25:06.687 --> 00:25:07.480
- Hey!
- Hi!


549
00:25:07.522 --> 00:25:08.439
- Hey.
- Hello.


550
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:09.148
- What's up?

551
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.149
- Good, hi, how are you?

552
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:12.568
- I'm sorry.
- I'm good, one sec!


553
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.362
- I'm gonna take off.

554
00:25:14.403 --> 00:25:15.488
- What?

555
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.406
- Dave is playing downtown.

556
00:25:17.448 --> 00:25:18.491
- So?

557
00:25:18.533 --> 00:25:20.451
- I should really go
and see his show.


558
00:25:20.493 --> 00:25:21.744
- What, the guy with the teeth?

559
00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:23.287
- This could be a job.

560
00:25:23.329 --> 00:25:24.872
That's what I'm in
New York to do.


561
00:25:24.914 --> 00:25:25.915
You don't need me here.

562
00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:27.208
- All right, well,
I'll go with you.


563
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.835
- No, no, no, you stay
here with your friends,


564
00:25:28.876 --> 00:25:29.710
and do your reading.

565
00:25:29.752 --> 00:25:30.628
- No, I'll go with you.

566
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.963
- No, no, no, no, you stay here.

567
00:25:32.004 --> 00:25:32.713
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

568
00:25:32.755 --> 00:25:33.631
- No.
- No, no, no.


569
00:25:33.673 --> 00:25:35.174
I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

570
00:25:35.216 --> 00:25:36.050

who wanted to tell the

who brought the girl to
a party where it seemed

- I don't like to

- Well, let's get out
of here then.


595

- I don't want to leave.

- Christ, what the fuck do
you want to do?

00:26:48.497 --> 00:26:50.833
- Is this where it
turns abusive?


598
00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:51.959
- God damn!

599
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:55.338
- [Man At Bar] Bro, what
are you, drunk?

I don't want to tell
you to fuck off.


603
00:27:05.848 --> 00:27:09.936
I don't, but since I met you,
I can't operate in the world.


604
00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:11.896
All I think about is
if you like me,


605
00:27:11.938 --> 00:27:13.898
and I know how lame that sounds.

606
00:27:15.191 --> 00:27:17.026
If you want me to leave
you alone, I will.


607
00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:18.402
I really will.

608
00:27:18.444 --> 00:27:20.655
It's just sometimes you
meet somebody,


609
00:27:20.696 --> 00:27:21.781
and you know whatever
you did before,


610

nothing could've been too
bad or too wrong

to this person.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.631

616
00:27:38.673 --> 00:27:39.674
- No, you aren't that person,

617
00:27:39.715 --> 00:27:41.467
or no you don't want
me to go away?

You're so, so special.

piece of cake to be with.


639
00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:38.649
- What's that mean?

640
00:28:38.691 --> 00:28:40.109
- Well, you're pretty skittish,
you know.


641
00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:42.903
You just don't come off as
the kind of guy to count on.


642
00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:44.322
Does she get you off at least?

643
00:28:44.363 --> 00:28:45.531
You know, take care of business?

644
00:28:45.573 --> 00:28:47.033
A blowjob or something?

645
00:28:47.074 --> 00:28:48.284
(heavy breathing)

646
00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:49.618
- [William] I don't
want any more blowjobs.


647
00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.370
- [Decker] You know, some
day, I'm gonna remind you


648
00:28:51.412 --> 00:28:53.789
of that comment, and you're
gonna be deeply ashamed.


649
00:28:53.831 --> 00:28:55.166
- [William] I have to
stop seeing this girl.


650
00:28:55.207 --> 00:28:55.666
- [Decker] Why?

651
00:28:55.708 --> 00:28:56.751
- [William] Because I
can't tell you,


652
00:28:56.792 --> 00:28:57.877
man, I'm scared out of my mind.

653
00:28:57.918 --> 00:28:59.128
- [Sarah] Stop.

654
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.339
- [William] My hands are
shaking all the time.


655
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.841
- Smart girls are tough,
they're a pain in the ass.


656
00:29:03.883 --> 00:29:06.552
- There's a difference
between someone who's smart,


657
00:29:06.594 --> 00:29:07.887
and someone who
doesn't like you.


658
00:29:07.928 --> 00:29:09.138
- [Decker] I will tell
you one thing.


659
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.681
there's a difference
between a smart girl


660
00:29:10.723 --> 00:29:12.058
and a girl who doesn't
like blowjobs.


661
00:29:12.099 --> 00:29:13.726
- You know, sometimes, I
think that if I could get


662
00:29:13.768 --> 00:29:16.062
her to like me, then everything
I don't like about myself


663
00:29:16.103 --> 00:29:17.897
would just disappear.

664
00:29:17.938 --> 00:29:20.232
She wants me to go out to
Connecticut to visit her mom.


665
00:29:20.274 --> 00:29:21.359
You think I should go?

666
00:29:22.318 --> 00:29:24.195
- Of course you're gonna go.

667
00:29:24.236 --> 00:29:25.780
- What do you mean?

668
00:29:25.821 --> 00:29:28.449
- Well, you're crazy about this
girl, you've got no options.

thank thee for this food


673
00:29:50.721 --> 00:29:52.515
and all the many blessings.

674
00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:56.602
Bless them to our use,
and us to thy service.


675
00:29:56.644 --> 00:30:00.356
And make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.


676
00:30:01.565 --> 00:30:03.234
- Amen.

677
00:30:03.275 --> 00:30:04.110
- Amen.

678
00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:09.281
(sighs)

679
00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:16.205
- So, Sarah tells me you're
an actor, is that right?


680
00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:17.873
- Oh, yeah, I guess.

681
00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:21.335
- I hope you're not too vain.

682
00:30:21.377 --> 00:30:22.461
- Mom, you don't
know any actors.


683
00:30:22.503 --> 00:30:23.963
- Yes, I do.

684
00:30:24.004 --> 00:30:27.842
I've met a few actors, and
they're all ludicrously vain.


685
00:30:28.926 --> 00:30:30.469
- This is really good food.

686
00:30:30.511 --> 00:30:31.679
- Yeah Mom, it's real good.

687
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.972
- Mm.

688
00:30:33.013 --> 00:30:34.515
- [Mrs. Garcia] How's
everything in New York?


689
00:30:35.808 --> 00:30:37.017
- Everything's great.

690
00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:38.894
- Yeah, it's wonderful.

691
00:30:38.936 --> 00:30:40.813
- Sarah has big dreams.

692
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.276
Did she tell you she wants
to be a singer?


693
00:30:45.317 --> 00:30:47.528
- I've actually seen her sing.

694
00:30:48.571 --> 00:30:50.739
- But, did you hear her?

695
00:30:50.781 --> 00:30:51.615
- Mom.

696
00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:57.955
- Did she tell you that
I worked my whole life


697
00:30:57.997 --> 00:31:01.417
as a secretary, saving money
for her to go to college?


698
00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:07.506
Did she tell you I was
valedictorian of my high school?


699
00:31:07.548 --> 00:31:08.507
- No.

700
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:10.342
- But I didn't
attend university.


701
00:31:10.384 --> 00:31:13.012
Sarah's father didn't
deem it important


702
00:31:13.053 --> 00:31:15.848
that either one of us
go to college.


703
00:31:16.891 --> 00:31:18.684
But she loves him.

704
00:31:18.726 --> 00:31:19.518
Don't you, Sarah?

705
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.145
Don't you love your daddy?

706
00:31:22.438 --> 00:31:23.105
- Hmm.

707
00:31:24.607 --> 00:31:27.610
- Well, I suppose she has
told you all about him, right?


708
00:31:29.403 --> 00:31:32.239
- We haven't talked much
about stuff like that.


709
00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:33.115
Excuse me.

710
00:31:34.992 --> 00:31:37.203
- She's not much of a talker,
is she?


711
00:31:38.829 --> 00:31:43.459
(Sarah sighs)
(laughter)


712
00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:46.295
Oh, don't get in a mood
now, Sarah, please.


713
00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:48.422
Sarah, I'm not being bad, am I?

714
00:31:48.464 --> 00:31:49.673
- No.
- No.


715
00:31:49.715 --> 00:31:53.260
I'm just giving your
young gentleman here


716
00:31:53.302 --> 00:31:55.596
a little information about us,
right?


717
00:31:57.223 --> 00:32:00.100
Putting your daughter through
college all by yourself,


718
00:32:00.142 --> 00:32:03.479
it is something to be
proud of, don't you think?


719
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:04.355
- Yes, ma'am.

720
00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:08.067
- I love you, I love her.
- Mm hmm.


721
00:32:08.108 --> 00:32:08.651
- Right?

722
00:32:09.818 --> 00:32:12.112
She's beautiful, she's a
beautiful girl.


723
00:32:12.154 --> 00:32:12.988
- Very beautiful.

724
00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:16.909
- You can't trust love.

725
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.706
William, let me give you a
little piece of sage advice.


726
00:32:24.124 --> 00:32:27.962
Friendship, true friendship,
is all you can trust.


727
00:32:28.003 --> 00:32:29.255
You'll see.

728
00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:30.506
Do you know what it is?

729
00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:34.677
I always believed in
being of use.


730
00:32:34.718 --> 00:32:36.470
I would ask myself,

731
00:32:36.512 --> 00:32:41.475
"How can I be of the most use?"

732
00:32:41.517 --> 00:32:45.938
Because William, it is in that
way that God speaks to us.


733
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.692
But Sarah, she doesn't
think about that.


734
00:32:49.733 --> 00:32:51.193
She wants to be special.

735
00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:53.153
- Mom, I don't want
to be special.


736
00:32:53.195 --> 00:32:54.613
I like to sing.

737
00:32:54.655 --> 00:32:56.282
The world needs singers,
doesn't it?


738
00:32:56.323 --> 00:32:57.366
- No, your mother doesn't.

739
00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:59.243
- Well.
- There you go.


740
00:32:59.285 --> 00:33:01.870
Your mother doesn't
need any singers at all.


741
00:33:01.912 --> 00:33:03.372
- Yeah, hm. (laughs)

742
00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:06.709
- And, excuse me, New York
has more than its share.


743
00:33:08.043 --> 00:33:09.461
- Mom, you're drunk.

744
00:33:09.503 --> 00:33:11.922
- No, I'm not drunk.

745
00:33:11.964 --> 00:33:13.173
I am your mother.

746
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.554
I have many faults,

747
00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:21.056
the worst of which is not

748
00:33:21.098 --> 00:33:23.892
how painfully I miss
my daughter.


749
00:33:25.102 --> 00:33:27.438
But I'll be able to
stand before God,


750
00:33:27.479 --> 00:33:29.481
and I'm a little
worried about you.


751
00:33:29.523 --> 00:33:31.734
(Sarah speaks in
foreign language)


752
00:33:31.775 --> 00:33:33.402
What about you, William?

753
00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.571
Will you be able to
stand before God?


754
00:33:38.741 --> 00:33:39.867
- Well, Mrs. Garcia,

755
00:33:40.743 --> 00:33:41.869
to tell you the truth,

756
00:33:43.662 --> 00:33:47.833
it's my opinion that I
have stood before God


757
00:33:47.875 --> 00:33:50.127
since the moment I met
your daughter.


758
00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:54.298
- Oh my.

759
00:33:56.091 --> 00:34:00.638
Sarah, we have a bullshit
artist sit at the table.


760
00:34:03.557 --> 00:34:06.935
Honey, I just don't what
you to get hurt again.


761
00:34:08.812 --> 00:34:10.564
(Sarah speaks in
foreign language)


762
00:34:10.606 --> 00:34:13.942
Well, he looks like David.

763
00:34:13.984 --> 00:34:14.818
- Shh.

764
00:34:15.819 --> 00:34:17.738
(speaks in foreign language)

765
00:34:17.779 --> 00:34:19.531
- [Mrs. Garcia]
Smells like David.


766
00:34:19.573 --> 00:34:22.326
(Sarah speaks in
foreign language)


767
00:34:22.368 --> 00:34:25.453
You know, he smells like
something I don't like.


768
00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:29.333
- I'm done.

769
00:34:36.131 --> 00:34:39.343
(light instrumental music)

770
00:34:39.385 --> 00:34:40.469
You shut her up.

771
00:34:41.636 --> 00:34:42.763
I'm sorry about that business.

772
00:34:42.805 --> 00:34:44.348
She only does it
when she drinks.


773
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:45.516
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


774
00:34:46.433 --> 00:34:47.350
- Mm, well?

775
00:34:49.937 --> 00:34:51.437
- What, you're doing great.

776
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.731
- I am?
- Yeah!


777
00:34:55.901 --> 00:34:57.361
- Hey, wait.

778
00:34:57.403 --> 00:34:58.654
- What?

779
00:34:58.696 --> 00:34:59.530
- Who's David?

780
00:35:04.284 --> 00:35:05.119
- No one.

781
00:35:06.245 --> 00:35:07.788
- He's your old boyfriend?

782
00:35:10.874 --> 00:35:12.501
- Let's not talk about him,
okay?


783
00:35:15.003 --> 00:35:18.298
- You know, some day, Sarah,
you're gonna


784
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.550
have to talk to me.

785
00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:23.971
(light instrumental music)

786
00:35:24.012 --> 00:35:26.098
- What do you mean, you
saw God in me?


787
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:30.853
- I don't know.

788
00:35:31.854 --> 00:35:33.522
Can I smoke a cigarette?

789
00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:34.398
- Sure.

790
00:35:35.441 --> 00:35:38.819
(light instrumental music)

791
00:35:38.861 --> 00:35:40.446
Don't be mad, okay?

792
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.625
David and I went out for
the two and a half years


793
00:35:53.667 --> 00:35:55.335
that I was at college.

794
00:35:55.377 --> 00:35:56.920
We lived together.

795
00:35:56.962 --> 00:35:58.714
After a while he said
he couldn't fall asleep


796
00:35:58.756 --> 00:35:59.673
in the same bed with me.

797
00:35:59.715 --> 00:36:01.300
I don't know why, so...

798
00:36:02.217 --> 00:36:04.094
I started sleeping on the couch.

799
00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:09.475
It's so embarrassing.

800
00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:15.981
One night, I heard this noise.

801
00:36:16.023 --> 00:36:17.274
So, I walk into our room.

802
00:36:21.278 --> 00:36:23.864
And he had snuck another
girl up the fire escape,


803
00:36:23.906 --> 00:36:26.325
and was having sex with
her in my bed.


804
00:36:29.703 --> 00:36:32.873
The worst part about it
is that I was so,


805
00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:36.710
I don't know, like
crazy about him


806
00:36:38.337 --> 00:36:39.713
that I didn't break up with him,

807
00:36:39.755 --> 00:36:41.757
or, I wouldn't let him
break up with me.


808
00:36:45.385 --> 00:36:48.555
And then, I dropped out of
college to try to end it, and...


809
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:51.850
That's why my mom is so mad.

810
00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:58.774
But the point is...

811
00:37:01.944 --> 00:37:04.863
I'm not so tough or interesting
as you seem to think I am.


812
00:37:07.366 --> 00:37:08.659
I'm just more of a dork.

813
00:37:14.623 --> 00:37:15.457
- Hey.

814
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.920
You should come to
Mexico with me.


815
00:37:21.964 --> 00:37:23.507
- I'm afraid of that.

816
00:37:23.549 --> 00:37:25.843
- They've given me a
first class ticket.


817
00:37:25.884 --> 00:37:28.303
I bet I could trade it
in for two coach ones.


818
00:37:30.055 --> 00:37:31.473
- [Sarah] I'm afraid to fly.

819
00:37:32.558 --> 00:37:33.976
- You're bullshitting me.

820
00:37:35.185 --> 00:37:36.603
Come on, you should come.

821
00:37:39.731 --> 00:37:40.732
- You have to work.

822
00:37:42.234 --> 00:37:44.653
I don't want to talk anymore.

823
00:37:49.283 --> 00:37:50.534
I want to fool around.

824
00:37:50.576 --> 00:37:51.410
- Good.

825
00:37:53.745 --> 00:37:55.956
- Do you have a condom?

826
00:37:55.998 --> 00:37:56.832
- No.

827
00:37:57.708 --> 00:38:00.043
- Then we can't do it.

828
00:38:00.085 --> 00:38:00.919
- Oh God.

829
00:38:03.755 --> 00:38:05.424
- Do you want to get
me pregnant?


830
00:38:06.633 --> 00:38:07.467
- [William] Yes.

831
00:38:09.136 --> 00:38:10.012
- Don't say that.

832
00:38:11.597 --> 00:38:13.015
- [William] Okay.

833
00:38:14.308 --> 00:38:16.768
(light instrumental music)

834
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.896
(Sarah sighs)

835
00:38:18.937 --> 00:38:21.398
- Don't you find it odd
when you're a kid?


836
00:38:22.941 --> 00:38:24.693
Everyone in the whole
world tells you


837
00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:26.028
to follow your dreams.

838
00:38:28.447 --> 00:38:29.865
And when you get older,
they act all offended


839
00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:31.408
if you even try.

840
00:38:32.868 --> 00:38:36.413
(light instrumental music)

841
00:38:41.209 --> 00:38:45.631
(women shouting in
foreign language)


842
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.972
I'll go to Mexico with you
if you still want me to.


843
00:38:54.014 --> 00:38:56.099
But we need to leave
a week early,


844
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:59.102
and then I'll come back home
before you start work okay?


845
00:38:59.144 --> 00:39:01.188
- Okay.

846
00:39:01.229 --> 00:39:02.314
- Good night.

847
00:39:04.816 --> 00:39:05.651
- Good night.

848
00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.321
- [William Voiceover] Mexico...

849
00:39:10.697 --> 00:39:12.532
Is where it all went down.

850
00:39:13.659 --> 00:39:16.244
(mellow music)

851
00:39:18.205 --> 00:39:20.290
- [Sarah] I think we
should have sex.


852
00:39:20.332 --> 00:39:21.667
- [William] Right now?

853
00:39:21.708 --> 00:39:24.711
- Yes, but I have to ask
you some questions first.


854
00:39:24.753 --> 00:39:26.171
- [William] Okay, shoot.

855
00:39:27.297 --> 00:39:28.632
- [Sarah] Do you have
any diseases?


856
00:39:28.674 --> 00:39:29.758
- Nope.

857
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.677
- [Sarah] Have you ever
been baptized?


858
00:39:31.718 --> 00:39:32.552
- No.

859
00:39:35.055 --> 00:39:36.098
Do I fail the test?

860
00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:40.686
Why are you so scared
to have sex?


861
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.695
- I think if we have sex,

862
00:39:53.198 --> 00:39:54.574
I'll fall in love with you.

863
00:40:00.163 --> 00:40:02.165
I'm not much of a lover.

864
00:40:07.504 --> 00:40:08.338
William.

865
00:40:15.512 --> 00:40:16.847
I want to fuck you.

866
00:40:25.439 --> 00:40:26.523
Turn off the light.

867
00:40:51.006 --> 00:40:51.840
Stop!

868
00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:53.550
Get a condom on.

869
00:40:54.509 --> 00:40:56.261
There's some in my purse.

870
00:40:56.303 --> 00:40:57.429
- [William] Where's your purse?

871
00:40:57.471 --> 00:40:59.347
- [Sarah] In the bathroom.

872
00:40:59.389 --> 00:41:00.807
- [William] Okay.

873
00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:24.372
Okay.

874
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.503
(groaning)

875
00:41:32.506 --> 00:41:34.674
Oh Jesus, I'm too nervous.

876
00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:39.262
- [Sarah] What?

877
00:41:39.304 --> 00:41:41.640
- [William] I'm too nervous.

878
00:41:44.684 --> 00:41:45.560
Okay, come here.

879
00:41:53.902 --> 00:41:58.907
Fuck!

880
00:42:00.158 --> 00:42:01.368
- [Sarah] What?

881
00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:02.953
- [William] Nothing.

882
00:42:02.994 --> 00:42:03.829
Fuck!

883
00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:06.373
Let's just go to sleep, alright?

884
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.091
- [Sarah] What is it?

885
00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.760
You don't want to do it?

886
00:42:18.802 --> 00:42:23.390
- [William] Yeah, I do, I
just can't right now, is all.


887
00:42:31.231 --> 00:42:32.732
- [Sarah] Why not?

888
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.031
Why not?

889
00:42:40.073 --> 00:42:42.909
- [William] Look, Sarah,
can we just go to sleep?


890
00:42:49.499 --> 00:42:50.667
- [Sarah] What's wrong?

891
00:42:52.252 --> 00:42:54.296
- [William] Can I lift
your veil now?


892
00:42:54.337 --> 00:42:56.131
- [Sarah] If you will be gentle,
ooh!


893
00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:58.008
- [William] What's the matter?

894
00:42:58.049 --> 00:42:59.176
- [Sarah] You're not
being gentle.


895
00:42:59.217 --> 00:43:00.552
- [William] Are you kidding?

896
00:43:00.594 --> 00:43:03.263
- [Sarah] No, I don't like
it when you're like that.


897
00:43:03.305 --> 00:43:04.347
- [William] Like what?

898
00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:07.350
- [Sarah] Cynical and sarcastic.

899
00:43:07.392 --> 00:43:09.060
- [William] I am sincere.

900
00:43:09.102 --> 00:43:10.270
- I am sincere.

901
00:43:14.316 --> 00:43:17.777
(heavy breathing)

902
00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:20.030
Are you wearing protection?

903
00:43:20.071 --> 00:43:20.906
- No.

904
00:43:21.948 --> 00:43:23.241
- It's alright.

905
00:43:23.283 --> 00:43:24.868
Come on, it's fine.

906
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:28.496
(upbeat music)

907
00:43:30.832 --> 00:43:34.294
(grunting)
(heavy breathing)


908
00:43:34.336 --> 00:43:35.962
(speaks in foreign language)

909
00:43:36.004 --> 00:43:37.839
Cynical and sarcastic.

910
00:43:38.673 --> 00:43:40.467
- [William] I am sincere.

911
00:43:40.508 --> 00:43:42.510
- [Sarah] If I would believe
that you believe you are,


912
00:43:42.552 --> 00:43:43.553
for a while.

913
00:43:43.595 --> 00:43:45.138
- Everything's for a while.

914
00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.808
For a while is the stuff
that dreams are made of...


915
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:49.684
Baby.

916
00:43:51.019 --> 00:43:52.771
I am sincere.

917
00:43:52.812 --> 00:43:54.231
- [Sarah] I am sincere.

918
00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:55.941
- [William] I am sincere.

919
00:43:55.982 --> 00:43:57.817
- [Sarah] I am sincere.

920
00:43:57.859 --> 00:43:59.694
- [William] Take two, okay.

921
00:43:59.736 --> 00:44:00.570
Action.

922
00:44:01.988 --> 00:44:05.116
(Sarah grunting)

923
00:44:05.158 --> 00:44:06.284
Can I lift your veil now?

924
00:44:06.326 --> 00:44:08.203
- If you will be gentle, ooh!

925
00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:09.037
- What's the matter?

926
00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.121
(Sarah laughs)

927
00:44:10.163 --> 00:44:11.581
- [Sarah] You're not
being gentle.


928
00:44:11.623 --> 00:44:12.749
- How was I being?

929
00:44:12.791 --> 00:44:13.750
- [Sarah] Rough.

930
00:44:13.792 --> 00:44:14.459
- Are you kidding?

931
00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:15.543
- [Sarah] No.

932
00:44:15.585 --> 00:44:16.962
I don't like it when
you're like that.


933
00:44:17.003 --> 00:44:17.837
- Like what?

934
00:44:17.879 --> 00:44:19.339
- [Sarah] Cynical and sarcastic.

935
00:44:19.381 --> 00:44:20.840
- I am sincere.

936
00:44:20.882 --> 00:44:22.384
- [Sarah] I would believe
that you believe you are


937
00:44:22.425 --> 00:44:23.385
for a while.

938
00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:26.012
- Everything's for a while.

939
00:44:26.054 --> 00:44:29.683
For a while is the stuff that
dreams are made of, baby.


940
00:44:29.724 --> 00:44:31.977
- [Both] I am sincere.

941
00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:34.562
(both laughing and kissing)

942
00:44:34.604 --> 00:44:37.107
- [William Voiceover] We
weren't good tourists.


943
00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:39.609
In our room, the scent of
sex was thick.


944
00:44:40.777 --> 00:44:42.821
I never wanted to take
a shower again.


945
00:44:43.697 --> 00:44:46.491
My hands, my arms, my face,

946
00:44:46.533 --> 00:44:47.909
all smelled of Sarah.

947
00:44:49.077 --> 00:44:51.121
We would mess around all
day till it hurt.


948
00:44:52.664 --> 00:44:55.834
It was hard to tell if she
was kissing me or touching me.


949
00:44:55.875 --> 00:44:58.753
Every part of her body
was as wet as her mouth.


950
00:45:00.088 --> 00:45:02.424
Sarah wasn't sexy the way
other people are sexy.


951
00:45:03.842 --> 00:45:06.720
Her body wasn't tight or
taut or anything like that.


952
00:45:08.346 --> 00:45:11.641
She was funny, the way watching
people fall asleep on buses


953
00:45:11.683 --> 00:45:13.643
with their heads
continually dropping


954
00:45:13.685 --> 00:45:15.895
and then jerking back up,
is funny.


955
00:45:17.689 --> 00:45:22.736
She was human, the most
human person I had ever met,


956
00:45:22.777 --> 00:45:24.612
and that was sexy.

957
00:45:24.654 --> 00:45:26.031
- [Sarah] Are you awake?

958
00:45:26.072 --> 00:45:27.782
- [William] Uh huh.

959
00:45:27.824 --> 00:45:29.701
- [Sarah] I remember
one afternoon,


960
00:45:29.743 --> 00:45:31.745
I came home from school
and my mom told me


961
00:45:31.786 --> 00:45:33.038
my father had left us.

962
00:45:33.913 --> 00:45:34.706
I didn't believe her.

963
00:45:34.748 --> 00:45:36.958
I thought it was a game,

964
00:45:38.877 --> 00:45:40.337
like hide and seek.

965
00:45:43.798 --> 00:45:45.342
So I looked all over the house.

966
00:45:48.595 --> 00:45:49.429
Closets,

967
00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:52.223
under beds,

968
00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:55.310
I looked everywhere.

969
00:45:56.895 --> 00:46:00.899
- Where'd he go?

970
00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.068
- He went to a rehabilitation
center in Albany,


971
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:04.277
and never came back.

972
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.531
But he wrote me once a month,

973
00:46:08.573 --> 00:46:11.409
from the day he left 'til
I went away to college.


974
00:46:13.953 --> 00:46:17.540
Once I was away from
home, he'd come visit me.


975
00:46:20.418 --> 00:46:22.629
He just never wanted
to see my mother again.


976
00:46:25.632 --> 00:46:28.343
His letters were my
favorite part growing up.


977
00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:30.178
Always came in these dark
blue envelopes,


978
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.263
and I'd keep them in a
box under my bed.


979
00:46:32.305 --> 00:46:34.265
I loved that they were blue,

980
00:46:34.307 --> 00:46:36.101
because when he lived with us,

981
00:46:36.142 --> 00:46:39.020
he'd come home always
wearing his blue work shirt.


982
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.148
And I'd sit on the back
of the couch,


983
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.441
and I'll scratch his back.

984
00:46:44.776 --> 00:46:47.070
I'll scratch for as long
as my mom would let me.


985
00:46:48.947 --> 00:46:50.365
When I went to bed at night,

986
00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:52.033
my fingers would be
stained blue.


987
00:46:53.493 --> 00:46:54.786
- [William] And you liked that?

988
00:46:56.704 --> 00:46:57.539
- Yeah,

989
00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.374
I did.

990
00:47:01.793 --> 00:47:03.503
Do you ever miss your father?

991
00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:05.964
- No, never.

992
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:11.010
(light instrumental music)

993
00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:14.180
- You see me?

994
00:47:19.394 --> 00:47:21.604
Would you like me to
scratch your back?


995
00:47:29.154 --> 00:47:31.239
(laughs)

996
00:47:33.158 --> 00:47:34.826
- Stand up and go to
the bathroom.


997
00:47:35.827 --> 00:47:36.661
- Why?

998
00:47:41.958 --> 00:47:42.792
- Just do it.

999
00:47:46.171 --> 00:47:48.923
(romantic music)

1000
00:48:11.613 --> 00:48:13.823
- [William Voiceover] I wanted
to tell her I loved her.


1001
00:48:13.865 --> 00:48:15.283
I loved everything about her.

1002
00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:15.950
(groaning)
- Oh, God.


1003
00:48:15.992 --> 00:48:17.202
I loved the way she
made me feel,


1004
00:48:17.243 --> 00:48:18.828
even when that was miserable.

1005
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:20.580
I loved the way she
bought a dress,


1006
00:48:20.622 --> 00:48:22.499
the way she made love
in bathrooms,


1007
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.125
the way she ate chocolate.

1008
00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:27.670
I loved her mother, her drunk
blue letter writing father.


1009
00:48:27.712 --> 00:48:30.173
I loved every thought
she ever had.


1010
00:48:32.759 --> 00:48:33.259
- [Sarah] Papi.

1011
00:48:33.301 --> 00:48:34.552
Are you okay?

1012
00:48:34.594 --> 00:48:36.971
- [William] I just needed
to get some fresh air.


1013
00:48:37.013 --> 00:48:39.766
- Well, go get us some beer,
maybe some OJ for the morning.


1014
00:48:39.807 --> 00:48:40.934
- [William] Yeah, good.

1015
00:48:53.571 --> 00:48:54.614
- [Sarah] What is it?

1016
00:48:54.656 --> 00:48:56.741
- I don't know, I got
this weird flash


1017
00:48:56.783 --> 00:48:58.326
of nervousness all of a sudden.

1018
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:05.583
- I love you.

1019
00:49:05.625 --> 00:49:07.043
- I love you, too.

1020
00:49:07.085 --> 00:49:11.005
(groaning and kissing)

1021
00:49:11.047 --> 00:49:13.091
- Go get us some beer, okay?

1022
00:49:13.132 --> 00:49:14.050
- Okay, I'm on it.

1023
00:49:18.137 --> 00:49:19.722
- Don't forget the OJ!

1024
00:49:19.764 --> 00:49:20.723
- No problema.

1025
00:49:23.101 --> 00:49:23.935
- Bye.

1026
00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:27.939
- [William Voiceover]
I ran through the city.


1027
00:49:27.981 --> 00:49:30.400
I wasn't looking for a
place to buy beer.


1028
00:49:30.441 --> 00:49:31.276
I just ran.

1029
00:49:32.193 --> 00:49:34.779
(upbeat music)

1030
00:49:43.037 --> 00:49:47.292
(people speaking
foreign language)


1031
00:49:52.505 --> 00:49:56.509
(people screaming and laughing)

1032
00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:02.307
(coughing)

1033
00:50:02.348 --> 00:50:03.516
- No!
- Yes!


1034
00:50:03.558 --> 00:50:05.268
- You don't understand.

1035
00:50:14.152 --> 00:50:15.361
- I thought you're not
supposed to drink


1036
00:50:15.403 --> 00:50:16.863
the water down here.

1037
00:50:16.904 --> 00:50:18.906
- But it's in a bottle.

1038
00:50:18.948 --> 00:50:19.741
- But it's--

1039
00:50:19.782 --> 00:50:20.992
- No, it's in a bottle.

1040
00:50:21.034 --> 00:50:22.285
- Alright.

1041
00:50:22.327 --> 00:50:24.037
- (laughs) Tourista.

1042
00:50:24.078 --> 00:50:26.122
(laughs)

1043
00:50:26.164 --> 00:50:28.791
(upbeat music)

1044
00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:47.060
(women speaking in
foreign language)


1045
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.395
- What?

1046
00:51:31.688 --> 00:51:32.522
- Well...

1047
00:51:34.148 --> 00:51:36.693
Carmen Maria said it's
possible to get married,


1048
00:51:36.734 --> 00:51:38.236
if you really want to do that.

1049
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:40.405
- Today?

1050
00:51:42.448 --> 00:51:44.701
- If you don't want to do
it, it's not a big deal.


1051
00:51:44.742 --> 00:51:46.494
- No, I didn't say I
didn't want to do it.


1052
00:51:47.412 --> 00:51:49.580
I just said, "Today?"

1053
00:51:49.622 --> 00:51:51.332
- Look, I don't know.

1054
00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:53.668
I'm just not sure if I
can be away from you.


1055
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.128
And how many times in a
person's life


1056
00:51:55.169 --> 00:51:56.087
are you gonna fall in love?

1057
00:51:56.129 --> 00:51:58.464
I mean... (sighs)

1058
00:51:58.506 --> 00:51:59.340
I'd love to marry you.

1059
00:52:00.508 --> 00:52:03.386
I figure, as long as we
maintain a sense of ourselves


1060
00:52:03.428 --> 00:52:06.139
as individuals, and
not become some sloppy,


1061
00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.141
clingy couple whose lives
revolve around each other,


1062
00:52:08.182 --> 00:52:11.227
then, it might be better
if we did get married.


1063
00:52:11.269 --> 00:52:12.895
Then, if something goes
wrong, or goes weird,


1064
00:52:12.937 --> 00:52:15.606
which, you know, it
most likely will,


1065
00:52:15.648 --> 00:52:17.275
we'd have to figure it out,

1066
00:52:17.316 --> 00:52:19.152
and one of us couldn't
just run away.


1067
00:52:20.236 --> 00:52:21.654
- [William] Do you want
to have a kid?


1068
00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.491
- [Sarah] Yeah, but
not right away.


1069
00:52:25.533 --> 00:52:27.160
- [William] No, not right
away, of course not.


1070
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:28.411
- [Sarah] No.

1071
00:52:28.453 --> 00:52:30.079
So, what do you think,
am I crazy?


1072
00:52:30.997 --> 00:52:32.165
- [William] Let's do it.

1073
00:52:33.332 --> 00:52:34.167
- [Sarah] Really?

1074
00:52:34.208 --> 00:52:35.376
- I want to do it.

1075
00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:37.795
- I mean, you have to be sure.

1076
00:52:38.838 --> 00:52:40.548
If we do this, we'll
be mentioned


1077
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.508
in each other's
obituaries, no matter what.


1078
00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:44.260
- Let's get married.

1079
00:52:44.302 --> 00:52:46.387
Let's be individuals,
let's have kids.


1080
00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:47.388
- Yeah, not right away.

1081
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.057
- Not right away.

1082
00:52:50.099 --> 00:52:52.059
But, fuck it, man.
(Sarah laughs)


1083
00:52:52.101 --> 00:52:53.186
Let's do it.

1084
00:52:53.227 --> 00:52:54.395
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1085
00:52:55.646 --> 00:52:57.607
(kissing and laughing)

1086
00:52:57.648 --> 00:53:00.234
- I don't understand
why you say that.


1087
00:53:00.276 --> 00:53:02.111
Well because it's my life.

1088
00:53:02.153 --> 00:53:02.987
Yes.

1089
00:53:04.614 --> 00:53:05.448
Mom.

1090
00:53:08.117 --> 00:53:10.703
I know it's fast but
it's what we want, Mom.


1091
00:53:13.331 --> 00:53:14.207
William.

1092
00:53:14.248 --> 00:53:15.833
William, come here.

1093
00:53:17.335 --> 00:53:19.378
Do you mind talking to her?

1094
00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.838
Just talk to her.

1095
00:53:22.799 --> 00:53:24.133
- Hello, Mrs. Garcia.

1096
00:53:24.175 --> 00:53:26.093
- [Mrs. Garcia] So you
what to marry my daughter.


1097
00:53:26.135 --> 00:53:27.178
- That's right ma'am, I do.

1098
00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.304
- [Mrs. Garcia] Stop
calling me ma'am.


1099
00:53:28.346 --> 00:53:30.556
You sound insincere.

1100
00:53:30.598 --> 00:53:31.432
- Fair enough.

1101
00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:33.017
- [Mrs. Garcia] Is she pregnant?

1102
00:53:33.059 --> 00:53:34.310
- No, she's not pregnant.

1103
00:53:34.352 --> 00:53:36.479
- [Mrs. Garcia] I didn't
have Sarah till I was 30.


1104
00:53:36.521 --> 00:53:38.481
That myth about a young mother

1105
00:53:38.523 --> 00:53:41.067
having pretty babies isn't true.

1106
00:53:41.108 --> 00:53:42.652
- Yep, I understand.

1107
00:53:42.693 --> 00:53:45.655
- [Mrs. Garcia] Now listen
to me very carefully.


1108
00:53:45.696 --> 00:53:46.823
- Okay.

1109
00:53:46.864 --> 00:53:48.533
- [Mrs. Garcia] You are a
complete idiot.


1110
00:53:48.574 --> 00:53:52.328
You are both exceedingly
lacking in intelligence.


1111
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:53.079
Am I being clear?

1112
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.622
- Yes, I think you are.

1113
00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:57.208
- [Mrs. Garcia] Since it doesn't
look like I can do anything


1114
00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:01.128
to change your mind, I only
can hope you prove me wrong.


1115
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:02.296
- I hope so, too.

1116
00:54:02.338 --> 00:54:04.590
- [Mrs. Garcia] Now give
me back to Sarah.


1117
00:54:04.632 --> 00:54:05.716
- Okay.

1118
00:54:05.758 --> 00:54:06.592
Bye, Mrs. Garcia.

1119
00:54:07.468 --> 00:54:08.761
- Hi Mom.

1120
00:54:08.803 --> 00:54:10.805
- [Mrs. Garcia] Sarah...

1121
00:54:15.935 --> 00:54:20.940
- Okay.

1122
00:54:24.902 --> 00:54:28.739
Yes, I understand.

1123
00:54:28.781 --> 00:54:29.615
Okay.

1124
00:54:31.158 --> 00:54:32.159
I love you too, Mom.

1125
00:54:33.494 --> 00:54:34.328
Bye.

1126
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.706
- Hey, what'd she say?

1127
00:54:38.082 --> 00:54:39.625
- I can't get married.

1128
00:54:39.667 --> 00:54:42.295
- What'd she say?

1129
00:54:42.336 --> 00:54:46.632
- She said that it
was a good idea.


1130
00:54:46.674 --> 00:54:48.593
That you'll be good for me.

1131
00:54:48.634 --> 00:54:50.344
That I'll never make
it on my own.


1132
00:54:51.929 --> 00:54:55.308
She was actually very
surprised because


1133
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:57.602
she didn't think that
you liked me that much.


1134
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.354
Huh.

1135
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.109
I'm sorry, William, I was
just being ridiculous.

- No, I can't go anywhere.

1139
00:55:08.863 --> 00:55:09.655
- Come here.

1140
00:55:09.697 --> 00:55:10.823
- I'm not gonna get married.

1141
00:55:10.865 --> 00:55:12.241
- I know.
- Okay.


1142
00:55:12.283 --> 00:55:13.284
- Two seconds.

1143
00:55:13.326 --> 00:55:15.036
Just follow me, come on.

1144
00:55:15.077 --> 00:55:17.288

1145

Where are we going?

1146

different flight.


1240
01:01:29.034 --> 01:01:29.868
- Why?

1241

- Sure.

1243
01:01:38.794 --> 01:01:40.796
- Okay, there's these two monks.

1244
01:01:40.838 --> 01:01:43.173
A monsignor guy, and a
regular monk guy,


1245
01:01:43.215 --> 01:01:44.508
and they're fishing.

1246
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:47.428
And the regular monk
catches this humongous fish.


1247
01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:50.889
He goes, "Wow, that is one
heck of a son of a bitch",


1248
01:01:50.931 --> 01:01:52.433
and the monsignor guy says,

1249
01:01:52.474 --> 01:01:54.268
"My son, watch your language".

1250
01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.270
And the other one says,
"No, Father, I'm sorry,


1251
01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:59.189
"but that's the name of
the fish, son of a bitch."


1252
01:01:59.231 --> 01:02:01.191
"Oh", goes the monsignor.

1253
01:02:01.233 --> 01:02:03.444
So that night they're
initiating some new monk,


1254
01:02:03.485 --> 01:02:05.279
and they decided to
serve the fish.


1255
01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.905
They all sat down
eating this fish


1256
01:02:06.947 --> 01:02:08.741
and the regular monk goes,

1257
01:02:08.782 --> 01:02:11.285
"Boy, this son of a bitch
is really good".


1258
01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.619
And the monsignor guy says,

1259
01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:14.997
"Yeah, I've never had son
of a bitch this good".


1260
01:02:15.039 --> 01:02:16.665
And he turns to the new
recruit and says,


1261
01:02:16.707 --> 01:02:18.042
"How do you like the fish?"

1262
01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:19.376
And the new guy says,

1263
01:02:19.418 --> 01:02:20.878
"Hey, I'm not much for fish,

1264
01:02:20.919 --> 01:02:24.089
"but I'm sure gonna enjoy
working with you fuckin' guys".


1265

- [Sarah] Are you sure
you can come?


1278
01:04:07.359 --> 01:04:08.986
- [William] Yeah,
it's no problem.


1279
01:04:09.027 --> 01:04:10.821
- [Sarah] We'll only be
gone for a couple of days,


1280
01:04:10.863 --> 01:04:14.074
and I'm kind of worried with
the two shows we're playing,


1281
01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:15.576
I might be kind of busy.

1282
01:04:15.617 --> 01:04:18.370
- Well, maybe it's a better
idea if I didn't come then.


1283
01:04:20.038 --> 01:04:21.665
- Are you sure?

1284
01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:23.834
- [William] Yeah, it seems
like you need a little space.


1285
01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:26.295
And I got some things I
could probably take are of.


1286
01:04:26.336 --> 01:04:27.754
- Okay!

1287
01:04:27.796 --> 01:04:28.839
I think you're right.

1288
01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.258
- What do you mean?

1289
01:04:32.843 --> 01:04:35.387
- Well, you just said you
have some things


1290
01:04:35.429 --> 01:04:36.722
to take care of, right?

1291
01:04:36.763 --> 01:04:39.099
- Yeah, but you know
that's a fuckin' lie.


1292
01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.102
All I do is go to the movies.

1293
01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:45.939
I've been to 13 movies
in three days.


1294
01:04:47.733 --> 01:04:50.027
I mean, you don't want me
to come, right?


1295
01:04:50.068 --> 01:04:50.903
- Ah.

1296
01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.031
I don't know, I mean...

1297
01:04:54.072 --> 01:04:56.033
(sighs) I don't know.

1298
01:04:56.074 --> 01:04:58.118
It's just, you don't seem
to do anything


1299
01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.287
except sit around and
wait for me.


1300
01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:02.998
You know that's not the
couple we wanted to be.


1301
01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:03.874
- I do?

1302
01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:07.377
- Look, while you were gone,

1303
01:05:07.419 --> 01:05:08.795
I mean, I don't want to belittle

1304
01:05:08.837 --> 01:05:10.506
the time we spent in Mexico,

1305
01:05:10.547 --> 01:05:13.008
but it wasn't very realistic.

1306
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:14.343
And all I did while
you were away


1307
01:05:14.384 --> 01:05:17.596
was sit around a wait for
you and think about you.


1308
01:05:17.638 --> 01:05:20.849
And, I can't do that.

1309
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:23.519
I've done that before, and
I know that sounds, ugh.


1310
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.354
Sometimes, you take that away.

1311
01:05:25.395 --> 01:05:26.772
- I take that away?

1312
01:05:27.814 --> 01:05:29.233
Take what away?

1313
01:05:29.274 --> 01:05:31.568
- I came to New York to
be on my own.


1314
01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.070
I'm just happy that I was able

1315
01:05:33.111 --> 01:05:34.821
to feel the way you
made me feel.


1316
01:05:35.906 --> 01:05:37.699
I didn't think it was possible.

1317
01:05:39.493 --> 01:05:41.453
- Good, you look like
you're feeling better.


1318
01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.126
So, what's going on here?

1319
01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:52.506
- Ah. (sighs)

1320
01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.049
- Are you breaking up with me?

1321
01:05:56.927 --> 01:05:59.555
- I just think we need
a little more space.


1322
01:05:59.596 --> 01:06:00.639
- Space?

1323
01:06:02.015 --> 01:06:03.100
Can't you think of
something a little


1324
01:06:03.141 --> 01:06:04.434
more original than that?

1325
01:06:05.811 --> 01:06:07.771
- I'm just trying to be honest.

1326
01:06:07.813 --> 01:06:10.649
- Well, then, you're a
pretty boring person if like,


1327
01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:14.069
catchphrases from breakup 101
are your idea of the truth.


1328
01:06:21.285 --> 01:06:23.120
- I like you so much.

1329
01:06:23.161 --> 01:06:24.580
- Oh great, you like me.

1330
01:06:26.123 --> 01:06:27.457
So I don't have to
feel bad then.


1331
01:06:27.499 --> 01:06:28.333
That's super.

1332
01:06:30.877 --> 01:06:31.878
I'm a sweet guy.

1333

with for a week or so but,

1335
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.221
not somebody to see like
on a day to day basis.


1336
01:06:46.476 --> 01:06:48.020
Why are you doing this?

1337
01:06:51.064 --> 01:06:51.898
- William.

1338
01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:55.485
You're gonna be fine.

1339
01:06:56.695 --> 01:06:57.821
- Oh fuck you!

1340
01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:04.703
You're a spoiled, selfish,
cold coward.


1341
01:07:05.704 --> 01:07:07.247
I've told people to fuck off,

1342
01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.750
and I know how
important you feel.


1343

that you suck!

- [William Voiceover] The
morning Sarah returned


1351
01:07:38.987 --> 01:07:41.865
from Boston, I was
singing a different tune.


1352
01:07:41.907 --> 01:07:44.868
It went something like,
I'm sorry.


1353
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:47.329
- Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

1354
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.582
Or, I'm gonna huff and puff,

1355
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.710
and blow your little house down.

1356
01:07:54.961 --> 01:07:57.047
Ooh! (howling)

1357
01:07:57.089 --> 01:07:58.340
- [Sarah] Stop.

1358
01:08:02.928 --> 01:08:04.846
- Thanks a lot, guys.

1359
01:08:04.888 --> 01:08:06.223
I appreciate it.

1360
01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.937
(door shuts)

1361
01:08:15.899 --> 01:08:17.316
Oh, come on.

1362
01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.443
How do you like my outfit?

1363
01:08:18.485 --> 01:08:19.610
It's my "I'm sorry" outfit.

1364
01:08:19.653 --> 01:08:20.861
- Look, I have to go to work.

1365
01:08:20.904 --> 01:08:22.405
- I know, can I walk with you?

1366
01:08:23.448 --> 01:08:24.574
Are you Native American?

1367
01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:26.118
- [Sarah] What?

1368
01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:26.868
- Nothing.

1369
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:27.785
Okay, so here's the deal.

1370
01:08:27.828 --> 01:08:28.954
I'm going to do the talking,
alright?


1371
01:08:28.994 --> 01:08:30.914
Because I have some
things to say,


1372
01:08:30.956 --> 01:08:34.251
and because you don't look
particularly talkative.


1373
01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:35.836
Not that you don't look
good, because you do,


1374
01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:38.880
that's why I asked the thing
about being Native American.


1375
01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.923
Anyway, I'll start the talking,

1376
01:08:40.966 --> 01:08:43.260
and if you want to jump in,
just say,


1377
01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:44.343
"Hey, I got something to say".

1378
01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:46.262
And five'll get you 10
then I'll say,


1379
01:08:46.303 --> 01:08:47.431
"Go right ahead".

1380
01:08:49.182 --> 01:08:50.851
Okay, I know what
you're thinking,


1381
01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:52.686
"God, this guy is such a creep.

1382
01:08:52.727 --> 01:08:55.105
"Two days ago, he says
all kinds of nasty things,


1383
01:08:55.146 --> 01:08:57.106
"and leaves my apartment
in a huff, and now,


1384
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:59.776
"he wakes me up in a tuxedo,
howling at my window,


1385
01:08:59.818 --> 01:09:01.069
"and expects me to
think it's funny."


1386
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:05.574
Well, let me tell you, missy,
you are absolutely right.


1387
01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:07.743
I don't even like myself.

1388
01:09:10.704 --> 01:09:12.914
So what, the suit
gets no comment?


1389
01:09:12.956 --> 01:09:14.124
"Why are you wearing that?"

1390
01:09:14.166 --> 01:09:15.584
"Oh, you're so zany."

1391
01:09:15.624 --> 01:09:18.336
Or maybe, "I can't believe
you're such a cuckoo-head."


1392
01:09:19.378 --> 01:09:20.881
Nothing, huh?

1393
01:09:20.922 --> 01:09:22.632
You're just gonna keep walking.

1394
01:09:22.673 --> 01:09:23.592
Okay, that's cool.

1395
01:09:26.136 --> 01:09:27.428
You want to know why I wore it?

1396
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.849
An attempt to make movies
more realistic.


1397
01:09:30.891 --> 01:09:32.476
I like to embrace the cliche.

1398
01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:37.021
Hey, this is A material.

1399
01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:40.441
Okay, I'm sorry.

1400
01:09:40.484 --> 01:09:43.528
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I fucked up.


1401
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:44.654
I got upset.

1402
01:09:44.695 --> 01:09:46.615
You just switched gears on me,
you know.


1403
01:09:46.655 --> 01:09:47.949
You got to admit that.

1404
01:09:49.242 --> 01:09:50.910
Look, I know you're
getting a little scared


1405
01:09:50.952 --> 01:09:53.704
that maybe we went too far,
too fast, and that's cool.


1406
01:09:53.747 --> 01:09:55.081
It's just you got to
give me a minute


1407
01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:57.292
to get the idea, you know?

1408
01:09:58.543 --> 01:10:00.504
I don't know how to
love you right.


1409
01:10:00.545 --> 01:10:02.589
You gotta let me know.

1410
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.257
See, this is the way I see it,

1411
01:10:04.299 --> 01:10:06.676
if the attempt is all, then
I can promise you everything.


1412
01:10:06.718 --> 01:10:09.262

a boyfriend.

1430
01:10:59.145 --> 01:11:01.731
- Are you gonna be
singing anytime soon?


1431
01:11:02.732 --> 01:11:05.235
- [Sarah] Um, no.

1432
01:11:05.277 --> 01:11:07.612
Listen, I should go to bed.

1433
01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:08.530
- Yeah, of course.

1434
01:11:08.572 --> 01:11:10.740
I'll talk to you later, then.

1435
01:11:10.782 --> 01:11:11.825
- [Sarah] Sleep well.

1436
01:11:12.784 --> 01:11:14.536
- Okay, yeah, you too.

1437
01:11:14.578 --> 01:11:16.496
- [Sarah] Goodbye William.

1438
01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:17.330
- Bye.

1439
01:11:18.373 --> 01:11:19.624
- [William Voiceover]
I held onto the phone


1440
01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:21.418
like it was a piece of her.

1441
01:11:21.459 --> 01:11:23.086
Everything was
disintegrating so quickly.


1442
01:11:24.504 --> 01:11:27.549
I knew I was the dopey guy
standing out in the cold,


1443
01:11:27.591 --> 01:11:29.718
staring up at a warm window.

1444
01:11:29.759 --> 01:11:31.511
Hell, I wished it would rain.

1445
01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:33.638
It's just so hard to
miss someone


1446
01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.640
who only lives eight
blocks away.


1447
01:11:37.058 --> 01:11:38.810
- [Jesse] At a certain point
William, your father not


1448
01:11:38.852 --> 01:11:42.063
calling you on your birthday
becomes your problem, not his.


1449
01:11:42.105 --> 01:11:43.607
- I didn't expect him to call.

1450
01:11:43.648 --> 01:11:46.818
- [Jesse] He loves you very
much, I'm sure of this.


1451
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.695
- Why are we talking about him?

1452
01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:51.031
- [Jesse] I just think
it's too painful for him


1453
01:11:51.072 --> 01:11:52.866
to remain in contact with you.

1454
01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:55.952
- Why are you giving this to me?

1455
01:11:55.994 --> 01:11:56.995
Who brought him up?

1456
01:11:58.705 --> 01:11:59.623
- I'm sorry.

1457
01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:04.669
- [William] Why do you
think she doesn't like me?


1458
01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:05.545
- Who?

1459
01:12:06.463 --> 01:12:07.714
What, that girl?

1460
01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.591
Because there's something
wrong with her.


1461
01:12:09.633 --> 01:12:10.634
- No, Mom.

1462
01:12:10.675 --> 01:12:13.011
There's something wrong with me.

1463
01:12:13.053 --> 01:12:14.471
What do you think it is?

1464
01:12:14.512 --> 01:12:17.349
- You respect people more
when they don't respect you.


1465
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:19.392
That, and you didn't
go to college.


1466
01:12:19.434 --> 01:12:20.936
Those are your only two flaws.

1467
01:12:25.148 --> 01:12:28.944
Do you want to hear
about my new boyfriend?


1468
01:12:30.111 --> 01:12:32.489
I suppose that doesn't
interest you.


1469
01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:33.365
He's very funny.

1470
01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:36.242
His name is Harris.

1471
01:12:38.453 --> 01:12:40.622
I think you'll be
astonished at how many times


1472
01:12:40.664 --> 01:12:41.623
you fall in love.

1473
01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:45.627
- I just...

1474
01:12:47.253 --> 01:12:51.299
I just don't seem to have
the first idea


1475
01:12:51.341 --> 01:12:54.511
about how men are
supposed to behave.


1476
01:12:54.552 --> 01:12:58.264
It seems like I don't
have certain qualities


1477
01:12:58.306 --> 01:12:59.683
that I should, you know?

1478
01:12:59.724 --> 01:13:02.602
I mean, I'm sure most men
don't sit around


1479
01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:05.814
getting all chatty
with their moms.


1480
01:13:05.855 --> 01:13:08.108
You know what I'm saying?

1481
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:09.359
What are other men like?

1482
01:13:10.735 --> 01:13:11.611
Are they like me?

1483
01:13:14.197 --> 01:13:15.031
- I don't know.

1484
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:19.077
- Hey, how come I'm
not baptized?


1485
01:13:21.079 --> 01:13:23.164
Weren't you the least
bit concerned


1486
01:13:23.206 --> 01:13:24.874
with the state of my soul?

1487
01:13:24.916 --> 01:13:26.251
- Oh...

1488
01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:28.336
Listen, William,
there was nothing


1489
01:13:28.378 --> 01:13:30.755
anybody at the Fort Worth
First Methodist could do


1490
01:13:30.797 --> 01:13:32.132
for the state of your soul.

1491
01:13:33.466 --> 01:13:35.093
- [William] Oh, forget
it, it's not important.


1492
01:13:35.135 --> 01:13:36.219
- Look, listen to me.

1493
01:13:40.056 --> 01:13:41.891
You've been ignoring me
since you were 15,


1494
01:13:43.226 --> 01:13:46.730
and I was thinking that a
good birthday resolution


1495
01:13:46.771 --> 01:13:49.566
might be to change your
attitude about your poor old Ma.


1496
01:13:51.484 --> 01:13:53.194
Don't be so moody.

1497
01:13:54.654 --> 01:13:57.574
A lot of bad shit is
gonna happen to you.


1498
01:13:57.615 --> 01:13:59.367
People are not gonna
love you back.


1499
01:13:59.409 --> 01:14:01.244
And if you're serious
about becoming an artist,


1500
01:14:01.286 --> 01:14:02.328
that's the first thing
you should learn.


1501
01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:05.915
And listen, you're gonna die,
okay?


1502
01:14:05.957 --> 01:14:08.251
Relatively soon, okay?

1503
01:14:08.293 --> 01:14:11.296
So, that being said, you
have nothing to worry about.


1504
01:14:11.337 --> 01:14:13.423
No matter what happens
in this life,


1505
01:14:13.465 --> 01:14:16.968
you have two options,
only two options.


1506
01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:20.263
You can handle things
well and be happy,


1507
01:14:20.305 --> 01:14:22.223
or you can handle them
poorly and be miserable.


1508
01:14:22.265 --> 01:14:23.099
It's up to you.

1509
01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:28.730
Look William, I'm disappointed.

1510
01:14:30.315 --> 01:14:33.276
I didn't escape Fort Worth
to sell college textbooks


1511
01:14:33.318 --> 01:14:35.320
in Trenton, New Jersey,
that was not my goal.


1512
01:14:36.863 --> 01:14:39.532
I thought my life was gonna
be so much more interesting


1513
01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:42.285
than it's turned out, but what
am I gonna do about it, huh?


1514
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.376
The root of depression is
being too self-involved,


1515
01:14:50.418 --> 01:14:53.630
and the cure is to read.

1516
01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:56.883
Okay?

1517
01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.927
So, read some books.

1518
01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:01.679
Don't take yourself
so seriously.


1519
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:05.266
Exercise, take that gorgeous,
sexy body outside and move it.


1520
01:15:05.308 --> 01:15:07.435
Here, and open your present.

1521
01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:25.245
You gotta lose those
cowboy boots, William.


1522
01:15:25.286 --> 01:15:27.288
I worked too hard to get
us out of Texas


1523
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:29.207
for you to go around in
those things.

(machine beeps)

1530
01:15:59.654 --> 01:16:01.739
- [Sarah] Hi William,
Happy Birthday.


1531
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:05.243
I know your birthday is today
and I have some presents.


1532
01:16:05.285 --> 01:16:07.912
Today has been a really
bad day for me.


1533
01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:09.414
If you have some time,
maybe you could come by


1534
01:16:09.455 --> 01:16:12.125
tonight or tomorrow or--
(phone beeps)


1535
01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:15.044
- [William] Hey, yeah,
that'd be great.


1536
01:16:15.086 --> 01:16:16.963
No, I can come by right
now actually.


1537
01:16:17.797 --> 01:16:20.466
(knock on door)

1538
01:16:23.219 --> 01:16:23.970
- [Sarah] Hi.

1539
01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:24.846
- Hey.

1540
01:16:24.888 --> 01:16:27.056
- [Sarah] Oh, close your eyes.

1541
01:16:27.098 --> 01:16:29.142
I have to finish wrapping.

1542
01:16:32.687 --> 01:16:33.897
- Can I open my eyes now?

1543
01:16:33.938 --> 01:16:34.772
- [Sarah] Yeah.

1544
01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:42.697
Do you want a beer?

1545
01:16:42.739 --> 01:16:44.115
- Uh, sure.

1546
01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:52.123
- [Sarah] You can put on
some music, if you like.


1547
01:16:52.165 --> 01:16:52.999
- Okay.

1548
01:17:01.841 --> 01:17:03.760
- [Sarah] How was your day?

1549
01:17:03.801 --> 01:17:04.636
- Oh, fine.

1550
01:17:06.638 --> 01:17:07.889
How was your day?

1551
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:08.723
- [Sarah] Crazy.

1552
01:17:09.766 --> 01:17:11.643
I've been
ridiculously busy lately.


1553
01:17:11.684 --> 01:17:12.518
- Yeah?

1554
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:17.315
So, what are these?

1555
01:17:17.357 --> 01:17:18.191
- Presents.

1556
01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:20.902
- Okay.

1557
01:17:22.195 --> 01:17:23.488
I guess I should open them, huh?

1558
01:17:23.529 --> 01:17:24.364
- Yeah.

1559
01:17:31.162 --> 01:17:32.580
They're for candles.

1560
01:17:32.622 --> 01:17:33.456
- Cool.

1561
01:17:34.666 --> 01:17:35.500
- Look at this.

1562
01:17:41.756 --> 01:17:42.632
- You did this?

1563
01:17:42.674 --> 01:17:43.508
- Yeah.

1564
01:17:46.469 --> 01:17:47.303
- Wow!

1565
01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.312
Why did you give this to me?

1566
01:17:57.563 --> 01:17:58.773
- I thought you'd like it.

1567
01:17:58.815 --> 01:18:00.441
- [William] I do.

1568
01:18:00.483 --> 01:18:01.276
- Good.

1569
01:18:01.317 --> 01:18:02.151
- It's beautiful.

1570
01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:14.789
Do you want to keep seeing me?

1571
01:18:15.623 --> 01:18:18.126
(Sarah sighs)

1572
01:18:20.044 --> 01:18:22.130
- I don't think that
now is the right time.


1573
01:18:22.171 --> 01:18:24.173
- Then, why did you
give it to me?


1574
01:18:24.215 --> 01:18:25.133
- What do you mean?

1575
01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:28.344
- What am I supposed to do
with it, hang it on my wall?


1576
01:18:29.387 --> 01:18:30.596
- I don't know, I
thought you just--


1577
01:18:30.638 --> 01:18:32.432
- You think I want to
hang a picture on my wall


1578
01:18:32.473 --> 01:18:35.101
to remind me of a girl who
doesn't want to see me anymore?


1579
01:18:37.812 --> 01:18:41.149
- Look, I warned you that I
didn't think I could do this.


1580
01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:41.733
- Yeah.

1581
01:18:43.026 --> 01:18:47.405
You also made me promise
to force you to kiss me.


1582
01:18:47.447 --> 01:18:48.865
- You can't do that.

1583
01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.451
I came to New York to
be on my own.


1584
01:18:51.492 --> 01:18:53.870
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I
know the story.


1585
01:18:53.911 --> 01:18:54.954
- I'm just trying to be honest.

1586
01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.497
- [William] Well, I wish
you'd lie a little it.


1587
01:18:56.539 --> 01:18:57.582
- Oh, you want me to lie?

1588
01:18:57.623 --> 01:19:00.335
- No, I want you to fuckin'
appear.


1589
01:19:00.376 --> 01:19:01.919
We're apart for four
stupid weeks,


1590
01:19:01.961 --> 01:19:03.254
and I come back to this?

1591
01:19:03.296 --> 01:19:05.423
- Listen, if you really
care about me, you need--


1592
01:19:05.465 --> 01:19:06.299
- What did I do?

1593
01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:07.800
I didn't do anything wrong.

1594
01:19:07.842 --> 01:19:10.261
- If you really care about
me, you need to take the time


1595
01:19:10.303 --> 01:19:11.304
to understand me.

1596
01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:12.221
- Oh, this is my fault?

1597
01:19:12.263 --> 01:19:13.139
- [Sarah] It's no one's fault.

1598
01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:14.599
- Oh, well, that's debatable.

1599
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.101
- Look, I told you, this was
gonna be really difficult.


1600
01:19:17.143 --> 01:19:19.520
- Would you shut up with
the corny fuckin' lines?


1601
01:19:19.562 --> 01:19:20.480
You don't like me anymore.

1602
01:19:21.689 --> 01:19:24.650
I was amusing for a minute,
and now I should go away,


1603
01:19:24.692 --> 01:19:26.778
and hang your fucking
picture on the wall!


1604
01:19:30.114 --> 01:19:31.741
I mean, what am I
supposed to do here, huh?


1605
01:19:32.867 --> 01:19:33.951
You know, I've done
what you're doing.


1606
01:19:33.993 --> 01:19:35.870
I've said the shit that
you're saying,


1607
01:19:35.912 --> 01:19:37.080
and I know it's a lie.

1608
01:19:37.121 --> 01:19:38.581
- It's not a lie.
- It's a fucking lie.


1609
01:19:38.623 --> 01:19:39.749
- Well, maybe you lie to people,

1610
01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:41.084
but I am trying to be honest.

1611
01:19:41.125 --> 01:19:42.919
- [William] Ugh, would you
please stop saying that?


1612
01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.878
- Say what?

1613
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.837
- [William] Honest!

1614
01:19:44.879 --> 01:19:47.465
- Look, you don't love me.

1615
01:19:47.507 --> 01:19:48.716
I could be any girl.

1616
01:19:50.009 --> 01:19:51.928
I care about you and
you made me very happy,


1617
01:19:51.969 --> 01:19:55.223
but I can't hear myself think
when you're in the room.


1618
01:19:55.264 --> 01:19:57.975
Everything is a big game
of pretend with you.


1619
01:19:58.017 --> 01:19:59.352
Let's pretend to get married,

1620
01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.104
let's pretend I'm gonna be
a country star,


1621
01:20:01.145 --> 01:20:02.480
just pretend you're
someone else, remember?


1622
01:20:02.522 --> 01:20:04.065
- No, I--
- No!


1623
01:20:04.107 --> 01:20:05.733
Nothing is casual with you.

1624
01:20:05.775 --> 01:20:07.443
Everything is a fuckin'
big deal.


1625
01:20:07.485 --> 01:20:08.694
- No!

1626
01:20:08.736 --> 01:20:10.154
No, no, no, no, no!

1627
01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:11.197
Only you.

1628
01:20:12.281 --> 01:20:14.033
Only you're a big deal.
- Stop it!


1629
01:20:16.035 --> 01:20:18.496
- Okay, I'm handling this
pretty badly, aren't I?


1630
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:24.043
Listen, I'm a great guy,
you love me.


1631
01:20:24.085 --> 01:20:24.919
Look at me.

1632
01:20:26.504 --> 01:20:27.880
Would you please look at me?

1633
01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:30.800
I'm right here, look at me.

1634
01:20:33.594 --> 01:20:34.846
It's my birthday.

1635
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.765
- What, what?

1636
01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:44.439
- Okay, I'll go.

1637
01:20:48.401 --> 01:20:49.235
I'm sorry.

1638
01:20:50.403 --> 01:20:51.320
I'm really sorry.

1639
01:20:51.362 --> 01:20:52.947
I want to make this easy on you.

1640
01:20:55.158 --> 01:20:57.785
I don't want to be
pathetic, I really don't.


1641
01:21:05.042 --> 01:21:08.129
But do you think you
could lie to me a little?


1642
01:21:08.171 --> 01:21:09.505
Or, have me sleep
here next to you,


1643
01:21:09.547 --> 01:21:13.217
something just to make
this a little bit easier?


1644
01:21:13.259 --> 01:21:14.969
- I cannot do that.

1645
01:21:15.011 --> 01:21:16.429
- Yes, you can.

1646
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:17.263
God!

1647
01:21:19.348 --> 01:21:22.268
I feel like you're playing
some sick practical joke on me.


1648
01:21:24.395 --> 01:21:25.563
- I'm sorry you feel like that.

1649
01:21:26.564 --> 01:21:28.691
- Would you please talk
to me like a person?


1650
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.238
- Look, what you're going
through has happened to me


1651
01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.490
before, and once I got through
it,


1652
01:21:36.532 --> 01:21:38.826
I was grateful because
I was so much stronger.


1653
01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:52.340
- Strong?

1654
01:21:55.468 --> 01:21:57.011
I am fucking strong.

1655
01:22:14.028 --> 01:22:15.446
Where did you go?

1656
01:22:30.628 --> 01:22:32.129
- What a fucking bitch.

1657
01:22:33.798 --> 01:22:36.425
She didn't seem like
your type anyway.


1658
01:22:36.467 --> 01:22:38.469
- [William] You think
anybody who isn't like you


1659
01:22:38.511 --> 01:22:39.845
isn't my type.

1660
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:42.306
- That's not true.

1661
01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.059
She just seemed a
little crunchy.


1662
01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:48.980
I heard she wouldn't fuck you.

1663
01:22:49.021 --> 01:22:50.940
- [William] That's not true,
we had sex.


1664
01:22:52.441 --> 01:22:54.860
- Yeah, I didn't believe
it when I heard it.


1665
01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:58.906
I mean, I couldn't imagine,

1666
01:22:58.948 --> 01:23:00.741
you not fucking anybody.

1667
01:23:03.077 --> 01:23:05.621
- [William] She wouldn't
sleep with me for a while.


1668
01:23:05.663 --> 01:23:06.455
- Why not?

1669
01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:09.667
She have some kinda hang-up?

1670
01:23:11.168 --> 01:23:12.795
I think I was there,
but it was hard because,


1671
01:23:12.837 --> 01:23:15.339
I mean I was walking and
talking, 'cause,


1672
01:23:15.381 --> 01:23:16.591
okay, so here's what happened.

1673
01:23:16.632 --> 01:23:19.719
It was on pre-school,
and we went to this park


1674
01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.096
where I grew up, and I was
wearing this very special vest


1675
01:23:22.138 --> 01:23:23.764
that my grandmother had
just made for me.


1676
01:23:23.806 --> 01:23:25.308
It had like a little purple
unicorn on the pocket.


1677
01:23:25.349 --> 01:23:26.851
It was the very first time
that I wore it.


1678
01:23:26.892 --> 01:23:29.645
And my very first memory
is of feeding the ducks


1679
01:23:29.687 --> 01:23:31.355
that are in the pond, in
the Woodland Lake Pond


1680
01:23:31.397 --> 01:23:32.523
in Kalispell, Montana.

1681
01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:39.071
So, this Sarah girl,

1682
01:23:40.364 --> 01:23:41.657
she doesn't love you back.

1683
01:23:43.784 --> 01:23:44.619
- No.

1684
01:23:49.498 --> 01:23:50.333

01:24:21.947 --> 01:24:23.491
- [William] I don't have a bed.

1691
01:24:23.532 --> 01:24:25.868
- (laughs) Why?

1692
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:29.038
- Because I hucked it
out the window.


1693

- What?

1694
01:24:31.916 --> 01:24:34.168

01:25:30.057 --> 01:25:31.100
- I'm not doing too well,

1704

and I don't think you
want to be here.

fuck alone, okay!

1720
01:26:36.123 --> 01:26:38.209

she is envious,


1721
01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:41.670
her vestal livery is but
sick and green,

and none but fools do wear it!

1723

I didn't go out with a bang.


1731
01:27:06.779 --> 01:27:07.655
You can't say that!

1732
01:27:07.696 --> 01:27:09.073
- [Man In Building] Shut up!

this is not how to do it.

I'm scared to leave
my apartment.


1737
01:27:17.957 --> 01:27:19.124

I didn't mean to scare you.

1741
01:27:25.339 --> 01:27:29.844
I just wanted to say goodbye
with the best words I know.


1742
01:27:29.885 --> 01:27:32.179
- [Sarah] Yeah, well, goodbye.

1743
01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:35.850
(dial tone)

1744
01:27:37.101 --> 01:27:39.937
(phone beeps off)

1745
01:27:58.831 --> 01:27:59.665
- Fuck!

1746
01:28:03.502 --> 01:28:04.336
Shit.

1747
01:28:08.299 --> 01:28:09.133
Fuck!

1748
01:28:10.092 --> 01:28:11.051
- Come on, William.

1749
01:28:11.093 --> 01:28:12.511
William! Come on, come on!

1750
01:28:13.804 --> 01:28:15.848
Alright now, the Cowboys
play on Sunday, alright?


1751
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:19.101
I do not want you to miss
it, this is our year.


1752
01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.897
Don't get sad, okay?

1753
01:28:22.938 --> 01:28:24.064
When you're 13, I'll
ask your mother


1754
01:28:24.106 --> 01:28:25.357
if you can come live with me.

1755
01:28:25.399 --> 01:28:27.359
Come on, come on, you'd
like that, wouldn't you?


1756
01:28:27.401 --> 01:28:30.696
Alright now, listen to
me, we love you, okay.


1757
01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:32.865
- Hey kiddo, I packed a
few snacks in your bag.


1758
01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.950
I think you're gonna like 'em.

1759
01:28:34.992 --> 01:28:37.578
- Alright, listen to me now.

1760
01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.748
Never stray too far from
Texas in your heart.


1761
01:28:46.086 --> 01:28:47.296
- [William Voiceover]
That was the last time


1762
01:28:47.338 --> 01:28:48.297
I ever saw my dad.

1763
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.342
I thought about calling
him and telling him


1764
01:28:51.383 --> 01:28:55.179
I had never strayed too
far from Texas in my heart,


1765
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.556
and what a crock of shit
that advice was.


1766
01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:03.270
- I'm glad you decided
to show up, William,


1767
01:29:03.312 --> 01:29:05.147
but I need you to get
your act together.


1768
01:29:06.273 --> 01:29:09.610
Take a shower, change
your clothes.


1769
01:29:09.652 --> 01:29:11.236
I'm making an early
Christmas dinner for Harris


1770
01:29:11.278 --> 01:29:12.780
and his mom tonight.

1771
01:29:12.821 --> 01:29:14.990
Harris and I are going
to Hawaii for Christmas,


1772
01:29:15.032 --> 01:29:16.867
so you'll have to get
along without me.


1773
01:29:16.909 --> 01:29:19.036
I'm sure you'll miss
me terribly.


1774
01:29:19.078 --> 01:29:20.871
- [William] Who's Harris?

1775
01:29:20.913 --> 01:29:22.247
- [Jesse] He's my boyfriend,
William.


1776
01:29:22.289 --> 01:29:23.082
I told you that.

1777
01:29:23.123 --> 01:29:24.458
- He's living with you now?

1778
01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:27.753
- I've told you all this.

1779
01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:30.965
(phone rings on line)

1780
01:29:34.093 --> 01:29:36.303
- [Sarah On Machine] Hi
it's me, leave a message.


1781
01:29:36.345 --> 01:29:37.388
(machine beeps)

1782
01:29:37.429 --> 01:29:39.390
- [William] Hey listen, it's me,
William.


1783
01:29:39.431 --> 01:29:42.101
Are you there?

1784
01:29:42.142 --> 01:29:43.310
Are you there?

1785
01:29:45.145 --> 01:29:47.272
Okay, sorry for calling.

1786
01:29:47.314 --> 01:29:50.651
Just give me a call when
you get a chance.


1787
01:29:51.527 --> 01:29:52.361
Merry Christmas.

1788
01:29:54.571 --> 01:29:56.949
(phone beeps off)
(dial tone on line)


1789
01:29:56.991 --> 01:30:01.453
(phone dials numbers)
(phone rings on line)


1790
01:30:01.495 --> 01:30:03.580
- [Sarah] Hi, it's me,
leave a message.


1791
01:30:03.622 --> 01:30:05.499
- Hey, sorry for leaving
you another message.


1792
01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:07.793
I just wanted to tell you
that I know you might not


1793
01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:10.129
want to talk to me,
and if that's the case,


1794
01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:11.130
don't worry about it.

1795
01:30:12.214 --> 01:30:14.299
We'll talk when the
time is right.


1796
01:30:14.341 --> 01:30:15.384
All right, see you.

1797
01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:20.848
(phone beeps off)
(dial tone)


1798
01:30:20.889 --> 01:30:25.060
(phone dials numbers)
(phone rings on line)


1799
01:30:26.186 --> 01:30:27.771
- [Sarah] Hi, it's me.
Leave a message.


1800
01:30:27.813 --> 01:30:29.648
(machine beeps)

1801
01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:30.899
- Listen, it's me again.

1802
01:30:30.941 --> 01:30:33.027
This is pretty absurd, huh?

1803
01:30:33.068 --> 01:30:35.863
I just know that you're
not gonna call me back,


1804
01:30:35.904 --> 01:30:36.488
and you should.

1805
01:30:37.656 --> 01:30:40.451
I mean, I'd like you to,
that'd be nice.


1806
01:30:40.492 --> 01:30:42.703
Not that you give a rat's
ass about being nice,


1807
01:30:42.745 --> 01:30:43.996
because I know you don't.

1808
01:30:44.997 --> 01:30:46.498
It's just that I went
out with this other girl


1809
01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.125
a couple of nights ago.

1810
01:30:48.167 --> 01:30:50.794
Samantha, remember her?

1811
01:30:50.836 --> 01:30:52.838
I mean, I know you don't
like her because


1812
01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.382
she doesn't spout out a lot
of intellectual bullshit,


1813
01:30:55.424 --> 01:30:57.634
but she's real smart.

1814
01:30:59.094 --> 01:31:01.138
You shouldn't think that
just because a girl's pretty,


1815
01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:03.348
she's not smart, because
that's not the case.


1816
01:31:04.433 --> 01:31:05.809
I don't know, it
always seemed to me


1817
01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:08.437
like you had a lot of
hang-ups about shit like that.


1818
01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:13.192
Maybe it's just that
you try to be, like, all


1819
01:31:13.233 --> 01:31:15.277
extra smart because
you're not that pretty.


1820
01:31:16.528 --> 01:31:18.739
But you shouldn't do
that because you know,


1821
01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:19.865
I think you're pretty.

1822
01:31:21.575 --> 01:31:24.745
Not that you're, like,
fantastically interested


1823
01:31:24.787 --> 01:31:27.706
in receiving emotional
advice from me or anything,


1824
01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:32.503
but Samantha is definitely
an attractive woman,


1825
01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:34.046
and she's smart.

1826
01:31:35.255 --> 01:31:36.465
And, we had a good time.

1827
01:31:38.175 --> 01:31:40.219
It gave me some distance on us,
you know?


1828
01:31:41.303 --> 01:31:42.513
It made me miss you less.

1829
01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:46.683
Not like I'm some crazy
maniac missing you


1830
01:31:46.725 --> 01:31:49.019
or something, so don't get
all freaked out


1831
01:31:49.061 --> 01:31:49.895
and call the cops.

1832
01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:53.649
Just call me back, okay?

1833
01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.193
That'd be cool, you know?

1834
01:31:57.486 --> 01:31:59.613
I mean, I'm aware I'm
not first on your list


1835
01:31:59.655 --> 01:32:03.200
of people to please
right now, but... (sighs)


1836
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:06.995
Just give me a call.

1837
01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.666
I really need to talk
to somebody.


1838
01:32:14.503 --> 01:32:16.463
You know what I was
thinking the other day?


1839
01:32:16.505 --> 01:32:18.298
Remember how you used to
walk on the curb,


1840
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:19.591
and have me walk on the street,

1841
01:32:19.633 --> 01:32:22.094
so that we could be
the same height?


1842
01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:24.346
Yeah, well, that's
really fucked up.


1843
01:32:24.388 --> 01:32:25.639
You shouldn't do that.

1844
01:32:25.681 --> 01:32:28.684
I'm taller than you, and
you should just face it.


1845
01:32:31.436 --> 01:32:32.646
Yeah, well...

1846
01:32:34.106 --> 01:32:35.482
Listen, I don't want to
hang up right now,


1847
01:32:35.524 --> 01:32:36.817
because I know as soon as I do,

1848
01:32:36.859 --> 01:32:37.985
I'm gonna feel like
a real moron.


1849
01:32:38.026 --> 01:32:39.945
So could you just
please call me back?


1850
01:32:41.572 --> 01:32:43.407
Otherwise I'll
probably kill myself.


1851
01:32:45.492 --> 01:32:47.661
I'm not going to kill myself.

1852
01:32:47.703 --> 01:32:51.498
You know, you really have no
sense of humor whatsoever.


1853
01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.375
That always drove me
crazy about you.


1854
01:32:56.712 --> 01:32:58.172
All right.

1855
01:32:58.213 --> 01:32:59.673
Call me back, okay?

1856
01:33:03.886 --> 01:33:05.220
I'm gonna hang up now.

1857
01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.015
Bye.

1858
01:33:09.516 --> 01:33:13.228
(phone beeps off)
(dial tone)


1859
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:16.565
(phone dials numbers)
(phone rings on line)


1860
01:33:16.607 --> 01:33:18.233
- [Sarah] William, you
have to stop calling.


1861
01:33:18.275 --> 01:33:19.401
- Hey.

1862
01:33:19.443 --> 01:33:21.445
I thought you were
probably at your mom's


1863
01:33:21.486 --> 01:33:22.905
for Christmas or something.

1864
01:33:22.946 --> 01:33:24.990
- [Sarah] Christmas is
still a week away.


1865
01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:29.494
- Yeah, yep, hmm, I remember.

1866
01:33:29.536 --> 01:33:32.623
I just wanted to call you back,

1867
01:33:32.664 --> 01:33:34.583
and tell you I was
sorry for calling.


1868
01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.585
- [Sarah] You sound exhausted.

1869
01:33:36.627 --> 01:33:38.587
Why don't you get some rest?

1870
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:39.838
- Because I can't sleep.

1871
01:33:41.298 --> 01:33:45.177
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot recently,


1872
01:33:46.178 --> 01:33:47.763
more like non-stop.

1873
01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:50.474
- [Sarah] I appreciate
you thinking about me,


1874
01:33:50.515 --> 01:33:53.894
but we shouldn't talk
now, not for a long time.


1875
01:33:53.936 --> 01:33:55.354
- Yeah, I think you're right.

1876
01:33:57.773 --> 01:34:01.026
Or else, maybe I just want
to agree on something.


1877
01:34:01.068 --> 01:34:02.277
- [Sarah] Let's agree on that,
okay?


1878
01:34:02.319 --> 01:34:03.528
Goodbye.

1879
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:05.906
(dial tone)

1880
01:34:07.574 --> 01:34:10.327
(William grunts)

1881
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:14.623
- [Samantha] All this time,
I thought that secretly,


1882
01:34:14.665 --> 01:34:16.333
you were a good person.

1883
01:34:16.375 --> 01:34:18.001
But you're not.

1884
01:34:18.043 --> 01:34:20.254
- [Priest] And enjoy the
spirit of generosity.


1885
01:34:20.295 --> 01:34:22.172
The Peace of the Lord
be with you.


1886
01:34:22.214 --> 01:34:23.882
- And also be with you.

1887
01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:25.759
- [Priest] I'd like to invite
you to open your hearts


1888
01:34:25.801 --> 01:34:28.595
and shake hands with
the people around you.


1889
01:34:28.637 --> 01:34:30.222
- Merry Christmas.

1890
01:34:31.807 --> 01:34:33.642
What is it with you?

1891
01:34:34.601 --> 01:34:37.104
- Oh let's see, 
I can't sleep.

1892
01:34:37.145 --> 01:34:40.274
I go to the bathroom
about 15 times an hour.


1893
01:34:40.315 --> 01:34:42.651
I wake up to a voice
inside my head


1894
01:34:42.693 --> 01:34:45.654
that calls myself a faggot
with every throbbing


1895
01:34:45.696 --> 01:34:47.447
of my pulse.

1896
01:34:47.489 --> 01:34:49.992
I haven't seen my father
since I was eight.


1897
01:34:50.033 --> 01:34:52.494
And I'm 21 years old now,
and I feel like I should


1898
01:34:52.536 --> 01:34:54.246
have my shit together,
but all I feel is


1899
01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:55.289
everything coming apart.

1900
01:34:56.456 --> 01:34:59.793
And for about three
minutes I believed


1901
01:34:59.835 --> 01:35:02.796
in destiny and that, you know,
I had one.


1902
01:35:02.838 --> 01:35:03.714
But now, I'm...

1903
01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:07.926
I don't know, adrift.

1904
01:35:09.177 --> 01:35:10.846
I got no connection to anything.

1905
01:35:10.887 --> 01:35:14.474
Not people, not me, not you,
not family,


1906
01:35:14.516 --> 01:35:16.852
not the past, not the
future, not anything.

for us to drive around like
this, but your father...


1918
01:35:57.225 --> 01:35:59.895
Your Daddy is what people
like to call "a project".


1919
01:36:01.646 --> 01:36:04.733
He wants to make me very small,
and fit me in his pocket.

get a lot of good presents?

I want your daddy to
stop being such a bully.

You don't bully women,
William, it's not nice.

1933
01:36:46.024 --> 01:36:46.817

1934
01:36:46.858 --> 01:36:47.651
Hey, hey!

You hear me, you stay
in this car.


1938
01:36:52.364 --> 01:36:54.116
Now, I told you not to be here!

1939

Hey buddy.

1943

This is from Santa.

1944

- All right.
Just, hey!


1945
01:37:03.667 --> 01:37:05.335

with your father

because of the way he
told a joke.

2012
01:40:21.156 --> 01:40:22.198
- Could I bum one of those?

2013

- [William] Yeah.

2014
01:40:23.533 --> 01:40:26.328

- Mm, okay.

2018
01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:37.589
- Yeah well, you said
that day that,


2019
01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:40.091

come live with you.

- Yeah.

2022
01:40:45.221 --> 01:40:47.891

birthday's come and gone,


2023
01:40:47.932 --> 01:40:49.851
and you never even called me.

2024

2027
01:41:00.111 --> 01:41:02.781
- Well, apology not accepted,
you know what I mean?


2028

you were little

when we would...

2032
01:41:12.957 --> 01:41:15.543
You know, and your mother,
she...


2033
01:41:17.128 --> 01:41:22.133
Well, you know, and then, I
got remarried and... (laughs)

about something else?


2036
01:41:27.055 --> 01:41:27.889
- Yeah.

2037
01:41:29.849 --> 01:41:32.268
- I fell in love with this girl,

2038
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:33.603
but she broke up with me.

2039
01:41:33.645 --> 01:41:34.479
- [Vince] Yeah?

2040
01:41:36.022 --> 01:41:37.649
- She kind of broke my heart,
I think.


2041
01:41:38.483 --> 01:41:40.527
- [Vince] That'll happen.

2042
01:41:40.568 --> 01:41:42.070
- That happen to you?

2043
01:41:42.112 --> 01:41:44.614
- [Vince] Sure, sure, I guess.

2044
01:41:44.656 --> 01:41:46.157
- Did my mom break your heart?

2045
01:41:48.201 --> 01:41:49.828
- [Vince] I don't know.

2046
01:41:49.869 --> 01:41:52.122
I don't know, that was a
long time ago.


2047
01:41:52.163 --> 01:41:54.791
- Well, you got over it, huh?

2048
01:41:54.833 --> 01:41:55.667
- Yes.

2049
01:41:56.668 --> 01:41:58.878
- Well, good for you.

2050
01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.631
I just feel like I might
not get over it, you know?


2051
01:42:01.673 --> 01:42:03.758
Like maybe I'm too
sensitive or something.

01:42:05.218 --> 01:42:06.928
- Well, maybe you won't.

2053
01:42:06.970 --> 01:42:08.012
You know what I mean?

2054
01:42:09.305 --> 01:42:12.058
You'll move on, but, if
it hurt real bad,


2055
01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:16.104
then it'll scar, or, like a
bone fracture, or something.


2056
01:42:16.146 --> 01:42:17.814
You know, it'll ache
when it rains.


2057
01:42:17.856 --> 01:42:20.108
- Sounds like some
real deep advice,


2058
01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:22.152
coming from a guy who
bailed on his son.


2059
01:42:24.195 --> 01:42:25.238
- I'm just doing my best here.

2060
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.115
- Well it's not very good,
your best.


2061
01:42:27.157 --> 01:42:28.241
- No, no, it's not.

2062
01:42:30.702 --> 01:42:31.661
- I was in a movie.

2063
01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:33.747
I bet you didn't know that.

2064
01:42:33.788 --> 01:42:35.123
- No, a movie?

2065
01:42:35.165 --> 01:42:38.793
- Yeah, I'm gonna be a big
fat fuckin' movie star.


2066
01:42:38.835 --> 01:42:40.920
And people are gonna ask
you if you're related to me,


2067
01:42:40.962 --> 01:42:42.172
and you're gonna have to say,

2068
01:42:42.213 --> 01:42:45.008
"Yep, he's my son that
I never see".


2069
01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:47.969
- Well, that would be great.

2070
01:42:48.011 --> 01:42:49.262
- Why are you being so...

2071
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:52.056
I don't know.

2072
01:42:52.098 --> 01:42:54.350
- [Vince] How do you
want me to be?


2073
01:42:54.392 --> 01:42:55.477
- I don't know.

2074
01:42:55.518 --> 01:42:57.395
I wanted you to call me,
that's all.


2075
01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:58.229
- I'm sorry.

2076
01:42:58.271 --> 01:43:00.398
You know, I thought...

2077
01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.567
I thought it would be
better for you.


2078
01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:04.694
- God damn, it is bitch cold.

2079
01:43:05.904 --> 01:43:07.447
I thought it was supposed
to be hot in Texas.


2080
01:43:07.489 --> 01:43:08.698
- [Vince] Yeah, it's the
Hottest State.


2081
01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:09.699
- What?

2082
01:43:09.741 --> 01:43:11.075
- Fort Worth is the
Hottest State I know.


2083
01:43:11.117 --> 01:43:12.744
My dad lives there,
my grandma too,


2084
01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:14.537
most every grandparent
except a few.


2085
01:43:14.579 --> 01:43:15.371
I like it there.

2086
01:43:15.413 --> 01:43:16.456
Boy, is it hot.

2087
01:43:18.208 --> 01:43:19.000
- [William] What's that?

2088
01:43:20.001 --> 01:43:22.170
- It's a poem you wrote
when you were a kid.


2089
01:43:23.046 --> 01:43:24.547
- Oh yeah?

2090
01:43:24.589 --> 01:43:27.509
Does that make you feel better
that you remember some poem?


2091
01:43:30.553 --> 01:43:31.596
- No, it doesn't.

2092
01:43:34.098 --> 01:43:36.392
- I loved you so much,
and then...


2093
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:41.815
Hey, what have I got to
do to get this girl back?


2094
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:45.527
- [Vince] You can't will
anybody to do anything.


2095
01:43:45.568 --> 01:43:47.278
- What do I have to do?

2096
01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.822
- What was her name?

2097
01:43:48.863 --> 01:43:49.781
- [William] Sarah.

2098
01:43:51.866 --> 01:43:53.034
- Did she ever love you?

2099
01:43:55.745 --> 01:43:57.372
- I don't know.

2100
01:43:57.413 --> 01:43:58.206
I think so.

2101
01:44:01.543 --> 01:44:04.045
- Don't do anything.

2102
01:44:04.087 --> 01:44:05.672
Just be cool, you know?

2103
01:44:06.756 --> 01:44:08.716
Just wait, she'll call you.

2104
01:44:08.758 --> 01:44:09.551
- [William] She won't.

2105
01:44:09.592 --> 01:44:10.385
- Yes, she will.

2106
01:44:10.426 --> 01:44:11.261
- [William] No, she won't.

2107
01:44:11.302 --> 01:44:12.554
- Well then, fuck her, you know?

2108
01:44:12.595 --> 01:44:15.014
People who give up on
love aren't worth loving.


2109
01:44:15.056 --> 01:44:16.391
- What's that say about you?

2110
01:44:17.517 --> 01:44:19.853
- I don't know what it
says about me.


2111
01:44:19.894 --> 01:44:21.479
But, seeing you here today

2112
01:44:22.772 --> 01:44:24.941
says a hell of a lot about you.

2113
01:44:24.983 --> 01:44:28.653
(light instrumental music)

2114
01:44:58.057 --> 01:44:59.684
- [Dave] Do you what
to do it the same key?


2115
01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:00.560
- [Sarah] Sure.

2116
01:45:00.602 --> 01:45:01.769
- [Dave] Okay.

2117
01:45:16.451 --> 01:45:17.285
- Hi.

2118
01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.454
- Hi.

2119
01:45:22.206 --> 01:45:24.083
- Um, do you want to sit down?

2120
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.294
- Sure.

2121
01:45:27.962 --> 01:45:30.006
- [Sarah] We've been
away for a little while,


2122
01:45:30.048 --> 01:45:33.468
doing some tour of some
Canadian universities.


2123
01:45:33.509 --> 01:45:36.804
And I don't know, I thought
it might be a good idea


2124
01:45:36.846 --> 01:45:38.139
if we said, "Hello".

2125
01:45:39.057 --> 01:45:39.891
- It might be.

2126
01:45:41.434 --> 01:45:43.144
- [Sarah] How are you?

2127
01:45:43.186 --> 01:45:44.020
- You know...

2128
01:45:44.854 --> 01:45:45.688
Fine.

2129
01:45:47.148 --> 01:45:48.149
Good.

2130
01:45:48.191 --> 01:45:49.025
How about you?

2131
01:45:50.735 --> 01:45:53.363
- Like a cat, always nervous.

2132
01:45:53.404 --> 01:45:54.405
- [William] Don't worry.

2133
01:45:54.447 --> 01:45:55.490
I'm not gonna break anything.

2134
01:45:55.531 --> 01:45:58.159
- No, about performing.

2135
01:45:58.201 --> 01:46:00.954
My mom is coming tonight,
and she's so ridiculous.


2136
01:46:02.997 --> 01:46:04.624
- Sounds like a big night.

2137
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:06.793
- Yeah.

2138
01:46:11.714 --> 01:46:13.007
I just want to tell you that

2139
01:46:14.342 --> 01:46:18.137
the week I spent with you
in Mexico was probably


2140
01:46:18.179 --> 01:46:21.891
the best six days of my
whole life, and...


2141
01:46:23.267 --> 01:46:25.269
I'm sorry it all didn't
go down the perfect way.


2142
01:46:26.771 --> 01:46:29.440
But when I think about the
time we spent together now,


2143
01:46:30.608 --> 01:46:31.484
I am grateful,

2144
01:46:33.152 --> 01:46:34.320
for what it did for me.

2145
01:46:37.907 --> 01:46:38.950
I don't know, I...

2146
01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:43.705
I just think that
you're too intense.


2147
01:46:44.539 --> 01:46:45.623
(William laughs)

2148
01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:48.876
You are, I mean, you're
very intense.


2149
01:46:50.878 --> 01:46:52.255
- You think I'm intense?

2150
01:46:52.296 --> 01:46:53.089
- [Sarah] Yeah.

2151
01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:53.965
- Really?

2152
01:46:55.299 --> 01:46:56.134
I thought...

2153
01:46:57.677 --> 01:47:00.013
I don't know what I
thought, but something bad.


2154
01:47:01.639 --> 01:47:02.849
Intense sounds good.

2155
01:47:04.183 --> 01:47:05.435
I'm glad it was you.

2156
01:47:05.476 --> 01:47:08.271
If somebody's gonna
break your heart,


2157
01:47:09.439 --> 01:47:11.816
you want it to be, you know,

2158
01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:13.609
somebody like you.

2159
01:47:17.363 --> 01:47:19.449
- You've always had a
very deluded sense


2160
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:21.034
of how interesting I am.

2161
01:47:22.076 --> 01:47:23.661
- Yeah, well, I like you.

2162
01:47:25.329 --> 01:47:26.456
- And I didn't break your heart.

2163
01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:30.126
Your heart was broken long
before you ever met me.


2164
01:47:31.252 --> 01:47:33.796
- Oh, give yourself a
little credit.


2165
01:47:33.838 --> 01:47:34.922
- [Dave] Check, check.

2166
01:47:34.964 --> 01:47:35.798
- Whatever.

2167
01:47:40.136 --> 01:47:41.846
How's the movie business?

2168
01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:43.222
- [William] It's good.

2169
01:47:43.264 --> 01:47:44.098
I'm...

2170
01:47:45.266 --> 01:47:47.393
Starting a new one this summer.

2171
01:47:47.435 --> 01:47:48.269
- Oh wow, cool.

2172
01:47:49.437 --> 01:47:51.522
- [Dave] Hey Sarah, you
want to try one?


2173
01:47:51.564 --> 01:47:53.024
- Sure.

2174
01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:54.859
Are you gonna stick
around for the show?


2175
01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:56.194
- Yeah sure, I'll be around.

2176
01:47:56.235 --> 01:47:57.070
- Okay.

2177
01:48:11.417 --> 01:48:12.418
- My heart is gold.

2178
01:48:13.419 --> 01:48:15.296
What will you give me for it?

2179

(car engine starts)

2200
01:50:01.235 --> 01:50:02.612
- [William Voiceover] I
remember as a kid,


2201
01:50:02.653 --> 01:50:05.948
I used to walk down the
street 20 or so paces behind


2202
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:09.202
my mother, so that people
would think I was an orphan.


2203
01:50:10.453 --> 01:50:11.746
I wanted to believe it myself.

2204
01:50:13.122 --> 01:50:15.875
Not because I wished my
parents dead or anything.


2205
01:50:17.251 --> 01:50:19.712
But more because
orphans were tough.


2206
01:50:20.838 --> 01:50:22.340
They could handle anything.

2207
01:50:24.342 --> 01:50:27.303
And because I wanted to be
free from this emotional


2208
01:50:27.345 --> 01:50:30.056
chain reaction that
seemed to be sparking off


2209
01:50:30.097 --> 01:50:33.226
like a string of firecrackers
since the day I was born.
