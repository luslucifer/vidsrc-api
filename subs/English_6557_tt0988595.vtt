<i>Mozart found his calling at age five...</i>

2
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.351
<i>composing his first minuet.</i>

00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:02.284
<i>Picasso discovered
his talent for painting...</i>


4

- Oh. Thanks.</i>

00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:06.691
<i>- Oh!
- Tiger Woods swung his first club...</i>


6
00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:08.784
<i>well before
his second birthday.</i>


7
00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:14.294
<i>Me? I was eight when I discovered
my purpose in life.</i>


8
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.701
<i>I was at the St. Thomas Church next to the
Hyatt Regency in Weehawken, New Jersey.</i>

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.171
<i>It was my cousin Lisa's
wedding.</i>


10
00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.472
Here, Dad. Let me.

11
00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:27.376
<i>It was our first big
family event since Mom died...</i>


12
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:30.473
<i>and Dad was not in great shape.</i>

13
00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:34.020
Daddy, can you take me to the girls' room?
I have to go pee.


14
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.224
Uh, come on, Tess.
Let's go.


15
00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:53.228
Shit! Oh, shit!

16
00:01:55.342 --> 00:01:58.778
<i>- Oh,Janey, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. We have cable.</i>


17
00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:02.748
What'll I do?
What the f--


18
00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.579
The heck am I gonna do?

19
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:15.260
Thank you so much, sweetie.
You saved the day.


20
00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:18.889
Janey, get my train.

21
00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:25.832
<i>And that was the moment.
That's when I fell in love with weddings.</i>


22
00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.931
<i>I knew that I had helped someone
on the most important day of their life.</i>


23
00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:33.445
<i>And I couldn't wait
for my own special day.</i>


24
00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:38.280
<i>Oh,Jane, that's stunning.
It really is. It's the perfect dress.</i>


25
00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:41.320
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful.


26
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:45.016
Really? You really think so?

27
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.787
It's amazing,
like it was made for you.


28
00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:51.227
- It's for you. It's the bride.
- Oh, great.


29
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:53.231
Thank you. Hi, Suzanne.

30
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.494
-Jane, is it ready?
- Yeah. They just finished hemming it.


31
00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:57.570
- It fits?
- I know. Thank God we're the same size.


32
00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:00.071
- Are you coming now?
- I'm gonna have it over to you in just a minute.


33
00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:02.573
- Don't worry about anything. This is your day.
- Thanks,Jane.


34
00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:14.950
Come on.
Get that out of here.


35
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.927
There you are! 
You look great.

36
00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:23.019
- Thanks!
- Okay. Let's go. Come on.


37
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.089
Oh. Here.

38
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.067
- What's this?
- I brought you a shawl, Visine, Tylenol...


39
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.161
- a pair of my earrings.
- Ooh.


40
00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:36.504
- About your hair--
- What? The bitch said, "Up." It's up.


41
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.771
Okay. I'll fix it
inside.


42
00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.938
What's all this stuff?

43
00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:43.710
Let's just hurry.

44
00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:46.945
Aren't the dresses great?
The best thing about them is...


45
00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:49.955
-you can shorten them and wear them again.
- Definitely. So true.


46
00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:52.491
Give me a smile.

47
00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:55.891
<i>Okay. Excuse me.
On the right-</i>


48
00:03:55.996 --> 00:03:59.193
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union...


49
00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.790
<i>of Suzanne and Greg.</i>

50
00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:03.733
<i>This is a time
of great joy...</i>


51
00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:06.362
<i>as we honor two people
who have come together...</i>


52
00:04:06.473 --> 00:04:08.634
<i>to be joined
in holy matrimony.</i>


53
00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:11.711
- Oh, wow.
- Sorry.


54
00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:15.248
Taxi!

55
00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.682
Great.

56
00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:22.243
Thanks. 31 Water Street.
Brooklyn.


57
00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:25.223
<i>Okay. I will give you
$300 flat...</i>


58
00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.293
- for the whole night on one condition--
- Yeah.


59
00:04:27.394 --> 00:04:29.589
You don't look in the rear view mirror
or I deduct.


60
00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:31.664
- Deal? Great.
- Yeah.


61
00:04:36.803 --> 00:04:38.703
What are you doing?

62
00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:40.932
Hey. You just cost yourself

63
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:44.408
I-
- No one's looking.

64
00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:52.777
I'll be right back.

65
00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.858
<i>Thank God you're here. 
I'm freakin' out.</i>

66
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.086
- I forgot my thingy.
- Oh! Um--


67
00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:04.129
I brought extra.
No worries.


68
00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:07.065
- Perfect.
- Thank you.


69
00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:09.226
- Hi!
- Hi!


70
00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:13.568
Are these dresses great? And the best thing
is you could shorten it and wear it again.


71
00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:15.573
That is definitely so true.

72
00:05:15.675 --> 00:05:19.839
<i>We gather here today
to join in holy matrimony...</i>


73
00:05:19.946 --> 00:05:24.144
- Shari Rabinowitz--
- And Prakash Maharasti...


74
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:26.617
known to his friends
as "Woody."


75
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.659
<i>Shari and Prakash are so happy
that so many of you are here today-</i>


76
00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.592
What are you doing?
Get in the car! Come on!


77
00:05:35.695 --> 00:05:37.663
Go! Go! Go!

78
00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:39.459
- You in?
- Yeah.


79
00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:49.664
Hey! Hey!
You are down to 260.


80
00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:52.267
Are you sure you wanna
keep this up?


81
00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.973
- No!
- Okay, then.


82
00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:59.312
Okay. Which one do you want?
The brunet or the blond?


83
00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.410
<i>I kinda want the blond.
I'm not gonna lie.</i>


84
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.580
Casey, can't you keep it
in your pants for one wedding?


85
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.318
Are you kidding? The only reason to wear
this monstrous dress...


86
00:06:06.426 --> 00:06:10.123
is so some drunken groomsman
can rip it to shreds with his teeth.


87
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.258
What time is it now? Well, I'm just gonna be
about two more hours, so--


88
00:06:15.368 --> 00:06:17.427
I'll call you back.

89
00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:25.945
Holy--

90
00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:29.805
Whoo!

91
00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:31.543
Whoo!

92
00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:37.854
Whoo! Whoo!

93
00:06:42.062 --> 00:06:46.158
<i>#Lovely is the feeling now #</i>

94
00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:49.963
Hey! Wrong shoes!
Wait a minute. Wrong shoes.


95
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.129
Ziggy! What?

96
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.199
<i># Temperature's rising now #</i>

97
00:06:56.309 --> 00:07:00.143
<i>- Ha!
- #Power #</i>


98
00:07:00.247 --> 00:07:02.511
Oh! Geez!

99
00:07:02.616 --> 00:07:05.483
<i>Jane, I'm so hungry. 
Did you eat anything?</i>

100
00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:07.644
- Oh, yeah.
- It looks gorgeous. I haven't eaten anything.


101
00:07:07.754 --> 00:07:10.746
And let me give you some advice,
do not drink Moet on an empty stomach.


102
00:07:10.857 --> 00:07:12.757
<i>I'll tell ya. Whoa. 
Fall right off.</i>

103
00:07:17.898 --> 00:07:21.197
- Did you meet my grandma?
- Yeah. She was great. I really enjoyed her.


104
00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:23.394
- I think she's having fun.
- Oh, yeah. Lots.


105
00:07:23.503 --> 00:07:26.233
<i>#Don't stop
till you get enough #</i>


106
00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.069
<i>- #Keep on with the force #
- Whoo-hoo!</i>


107
00:07:29.175 --> 00:07:32.235
<i>- #Don't stop till you get enough #
- #Keep on, baby #</i>


108
00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:36.577
<i>#Don't stop till you get enough ##</i>

109
00:07:36.683 --> 00:07:40.517
-Jane, what is that thing on your forehead?
- Oh.


110
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.111
I'd like to take a moment
to give a special thank-you to a girl...


111
00:07:43.223 --> 00:07:45.919
<i>who's really gone
above and beyond.</i>


112
00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:49.689
The girl who not only hosted my shower
and helped me design the invitation--


113
00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:53.926
<i>She went with me to the caterer,
the florist, the wedding cake bakery-</i>


114
00:07:54.034 --> 00:07:57.492
And to eight bridal stores...

115
00:07:57.604 --> 00:07:59.970
where she helped me cling
to my self-esteem--


116
00:08:00.073 --> 00:08:02.132
As I tried on dress
after dress.


117
00:08:02.242 --> 00:08:04.710
So thanks,Jane!

118
00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:09.477
Thanks,Jane.

119
00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:12.279
Okay! Everybody ready?

120
00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:34.804
Is she all right?

121
00:08:37.344 --> 00:08:39.335
Is she all right?

122
00:08:42.115 --> 00:08:44.675
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.Just take it easy.


123
00:08:44.784 --> 00:08:47.344
You don't wanna move around too much.
Okay. This is a serious injury.


124
00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:50.685
I need you to give me some ice.
You, give me a bottle of 100-proof liquor...


125
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.621
and something
she can bite on-- stat!


126
00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:56.162
All right. She's fine,
folks.


127
00:08:56.262 --> 00:08:58.628
Just a little bump
on the head. Carry on.


128
00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:00.791
You a doctor?

129
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.358
No, but Tweedledee and "Tweedledrunk"
were bugging me, so--


130
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:07.201
- Okay. Do you know your name?
-Jane.


131
00:09:07.307 --> 00:09:09.502
Jane. I'm Kevin.

132
00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:12.976
Hmm. Thank you
for helping me.


133
00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:14.979
- Sure. Got it?
- Uh-huh.


134
00:09:15.081 --> 00:09:16.981
- Okay. You're good?
- I'm fine.


135
00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:20.575
All right.

136
00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:24.179
Whoa, whoa. Okay.
Why don't we get you a cab?


137
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.157
All right. Nice and easy.
Let's walk.


138
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.094
<i># That I'm irresponsibly mad #</i>

139
00:09:31.197 --> 00:09:33.427
<i>#For you ##</i>

140
00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:41.373
I loved your thong,
by the way.


141
00:09:41.474 --> 00:09:44.136
You buzzed past me earlier.
I saw you changing gowns.


142
00:09:44.244 --> 00:09:46.644
<i>You were in two weddings
in one night, weren't you?</i>


143
00:09:46.746 --> 00:09:50.307
- That's a little upsetting, don't you think?
- They're both good friends...


144
00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:53.853
and their weddings happened to be on
the same night, so what was I supposed to do?


145
00:09:53.953 --> 00:09:56.387
Oh, no. That's not the upsetting part.
How do you stand it?


146
00:09:56.489 --> 00:09:58.980
- I mean, isn't one wedding bad enough?
- I love weddings. I always have.


147
00:09:59.092 --> 00:10:00.582
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>


148
00:10:00.694 --> 00:10:03.925
Which part, the forced merriment,
horrible music or bad food?


149
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.329
Actually, it's meeting
upbeat people like yourself.


150
00:10:07.434 --> 00:10:11.564
Love is patient. Love is kind.
Love means slowly losing your mind.


151
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:13.639
- What is it you do again?
- I'm a writer.


152
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.640
Right.

153
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:20.602
<i>- This is my building.
- I got it.</i>


154
00:10:20.714 --> 00:10:22.614
- No. I got it.
- Sure?


155
00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:24.877
Yeah.

156
00:10:24.984 --> 00:10:28.351
All right, sweetie. A hundred and forty.
You know what you did.


157
00:10:28.455 --> 00:10:31.219
Hey! What's-- No.
He's gonna be right back. Hold on.


158
00:10:31.324 --> 00:10:34.350
Don't you think it's a whole lot of ritual
for something that--


159
00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:37.624
Let's face it-- It's got about a 50-50 shot
of making it out of the gate.


160
00:10:37.731 --> 00:10:39.858
How very refreshing.
A man who doesn't believe in marriage.


161
00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:42.434
- I'm just trying to point out
the hypocrisy of the spectacle.
- Oh.


162
00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:44.526
That's so noble of you.
Do you also go around...


163
00:10:44.637 --> 00:10:46.537
telling small children
that Santa Claus doesn't exist?


164
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.539
'Cause someone needs
to blow that shit wide open.


165
00:10:48.641 --> 00:10:52.077
So you admit that believing in marriage
is kind of like believing in Santa Claus.


166
00:10:52.178 --> 00:10:54.408
No. I--

167
00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:58.682
I don't know why I'm arguing
this with a perfect stranger.


168
00:10:58.785 --> 00:11:01.549
But, yes, marriage, like everything good
and important, isn't easy.


169
00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:04.384
Cynicism, on the other hand,
always is.


170
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:07.255
- It was very interesting meeting you.
- Bye.


171
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.590
Yeah.

172
00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:11.721
You gonna be in more
weddings next weekend?


173
00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:14.163
<i>- I have to go.
- How many have you been in, by the way?</i>


174
00:11:14.267 --> 00:11:17.100
<i>- Just, like, ballpark.
- Good night.</i>


175
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:27.909
<i>- Hey, you know what? Could you--
- Yeah?</i>


176
00:11:28.014 --> 00:11:30.812
<i>- Forget it.
- Yup.</i>


177
00:12:14.294 --> 00:12:17.354
Okay.

178
00:12:24.137 --> 00:12:28.665
Death. Destruction.
Wedding vows. Yea.


179
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.801
Come to mama.

180
00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:39.043
Oh.

181
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.198
<i>Jeter hit a walk-off
in the ninth. Did you see it?</i>


182
00:12:57.303 --> 00:12:59.328
Uh, no. I work
Saturday nights, remember?


183
00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:02.408
- Here. From the happy couple.
- Oh, that's right.


184
00:13:02.508 --> 00:13:06.808
You were eating coconut cake
and doing the Electric Slide.


185
00:13:06.913 --> 00:13:08.904
- So how'd it go?
- Oh, let's see.


186
00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:11.506
The bride wore a gown that sparkled
like the groom's eyes...


187
00:13:11.618 --> 00:13:14.917
as he saw her approaching
through a shower of rose petals.


188
00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:17.251
And you're not
getting laid?


189
00:13:17.357 --> 00:13:19.621
Commitments is the gold standard
of wedding announcements.


190
00:13:19.726 --> 00:13:22.490
Every girl on the planet rips open that page,
first thing Sunday.


191
00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:24.790
Brides kill to get in there.

192
00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:27.924
Do you have any idea
what you can be doin'?


193
00:13:28.034 --> 00:13:30.229
- You mean to women who are
about to get married?
- Yeah.


194
00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:32.236
They won't call you.
They won't bother you.


195
00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:35.239
They will pretend they never even met you.
You can't beat that.


196
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.605
Well, it's not gonna
matter much longer anyway.


197
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.077
- You're looking at my ticket
out of the taffeta ghetto.
- Keep on dreaming.


198
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.207
- Uh, go away.
- Yes. Okay.


199
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.453
What? I wasn't gonna come
to work in my bridesmaid dress.


200
00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:55.823
Two-day walk of shame outfit.
Elegant.


201
00:13:58.598 --> 00:14:00.828
What happened to you
the other night?


202
00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:03.562
You were barely there,
and then you disappeared.


203
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.400
- You meet someone?
- Come on. No.


204
00:14:06.506 --> 00:14:08.474
Oh. Ridiculous question.

205
00:14:10.843 --> 00:14:12.811
- Good morning, Gina.
- Hi.


206
00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:16.609
- You haven't seen my Filofax
anywhere, have you?
- No.


207
00:14:16.716 --> 00:14:18.741
No. Okay.
I'll go look for it.


208
00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:22.685
- Did you get those catalog pages in for George?
- No.


209
00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:25.314
Okay. No worries.
I'll get them from production.


210
00:14:26.693 --> 00:14:28.593
Attagirl.
Show her who's boss.


211
00:14:28.695 --> 00:14:31.129
- I'm not her boss.
- You're the boss's assistant.


212
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.199
Same diff. What's the good of your job
if you can't abuse the power?


213
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.291
- Casey, go to Accounting.
- Now you're bossy.


214
00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:45.102
Where the hell
did I put that thing?


215
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.009
That is a great idea for the front page
of the section.


216
00:14:48.114 --> 00:14:50.639
Oh, come on, Doyle. How many times
have I heard this from you?


217
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.718
<i>- I'm telling you, Maureen. It's a great idea.
- Really?</i>


218
00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:57.153
As great as your last great idea, an expose
on price-fixing at wedding bakeries?


219
00:14:57.256 --> 00:14:59.952
Yes! Yes! They're ripping people off.
Flour costs pennies per ounce.


220
00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:02.425
That's an 8000/0 markup.
It's outrageous.


221
00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:04.689
Yes, it is.
Also, no one cares.


222
00:15:04.797 --> 00:15:07.891
What about the piece I wanted to do on
the exploitation of workers in lace factories?


223
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:09.901
- That is a killer piece.
- Oh, right.


224
00:15:10.003 --> 00:15:12.471
That's what people really wanna
read about in the Style section.


225
00:15:12.572 --> 00:15:16.633
<i>Kevin, this section practically
pays for the entire paper.</i>


226
00:15:16.743 --> 00:15:20.008
Our advertisers want fun, upbeat,
colorful human-interest stories...


227
00:15:20.113 --> 00:15:22.911
- opposite their products.
- So that's what we're about now? Making money?


228
00:15:23.016 --> 00:15:25.746
- Get out.
- All right. Listen. That was not right.


229
00:15:25.852 --> 00:15:27.911
I get it. But this one is.
Look, this woman...


230
00:15:28.021 --> 00:15:30.114
- has been in seven weddings--
- So?


231
00:15:30.223 --> 00:15:33.989
This year. She was in two
on Saturday alone.


232
00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:36.254
But it won't just be about her.

233
00:15:36.362 --> 00:15:39.388
<i>It'll be an incisive look at how the wedding
industry has transformed something...</i>


234
00:15:39.499 --> 00:15:43.765
that should be an important rite
of passage into nothing more
than a corporate revenue stream.


235
00:15:45.638 --> 00:15:49.039
In a fun, upbeat, you know,
cheerful way.


236
00:15:49.142 --> 00:15:51.667
Look, Maureen, I am dying
back there in Commitments.


237
00:15:51.778 --> 00:15:54.872
If I have to write another sentence about
baby's breath, I'm gonna shoot myself.


238
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:56.949
This is a real story.
This is what I wanna do.


239
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.712
I need you covering weddings.
That's what you're good at.


240
00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:01.787
And that's what
I need you to do.


241
00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:04.516
If you don't start giving me feature stories,
I'm gonna have to quit.


242
00:16:04.624 --> 00:16:09.061
One chance. If I don't like it, you go back
to Commitments for the rest of your life...


243
00:16:09.162 --> 00:16:11.926
with a big smile on that ridiculously
handsome face of yours.


244
00:16:12.031 --> 00:16:14.864
Deal.

245
00:16:15.968 --> 00:16:18.766
- You think he'll like these?
- Yes, I do.


246
00:16:18.871 --> 00:16:22.864
<i>I think those photos for the fall catalog will
cause George to take you into his office...</i>


247
00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:26.809
- and make sweet love to you for hours and hours.
- Shh! Casey.


248
00:16:26.913 --> 00:16:30.610
Tell me that crazy crush is the reason you
work as hard as you do, 'cause it's upsetting.


249
00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:33.844
-Just like my job. Okay?
- No. You just think that one day...


250
00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:37.286
George is gonna wake up and realize
that he is madly in love with you...


251
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.154
- and he's gonna make some
spectacular gesture of love--
- Flowers for Jane Nichols.


252
00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:42.819
Yeah. That's me.
Thank you.


253
00:16:44.497 --> 00:16:47.933
That's great. I spent two days in bed
with a guy, and you get flowers.


254
00:16:48.034 --> 00:16:50.093
- Nice.
- There's no note.


255
00:16:51.938 --> 00:16:55.430
Oh,Jane. You don't seriously think
they're from your dream guy, do you?


256
00:16:55.541 --> 00:16:58.635
Gina, can you take these
to my desk for me?


257
00:16:58.744 --> 00:17:00.109
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you.


258
00:17:00.213 --> 00:17:02.511
Would you please stop
saying that? Nobody knows.


259
00:17:02.615 --> 00:17:04.640
Everybody knows,Jane,
except George.


260
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.184
It's true.

261
00:17:07.286 --> 00:17:11.655
Gatsby! Hi, buddy. Hi!

262
00:17:11.757 --> 00:17:14.624
Whoa! Come on, Gatsby.
No slobbering on the ladies.


263
00:17:14.727 --> 00:17:16.820
Hi.

264
00:17:18.264 --> 00:17:22.200
- How was it?
- It was phenomenal. Up and back...


265
00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:24.565
in 10 hours--
our best time yet.


266
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.695
Isn't that, like, the eighth time
you climbed Mount Whitney?


267
00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:29.934
- How do you remember that stuff,Jane?
- I don't know.


268
00:17:30.042 --> 00:17:33.534
- So we just got these in. What do you think?
- I think they're too corporate.


269
00:17:33.646 --> 00:17:36.274
<i>That's what I was thinking. They don't
have enough of a feel of being-</i>


270
00:17:36.382 --> 00:17:38.612
Outdoors. Right. I mean,
there's no adventure.


271
00:17:38.718 --> 00:17:41.209
There's no danger. Plus, everyone
looks way too put together.


272
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.550
Yeah. Like models. Got it.
I will talk to Marketing.


273
00:17:43.656 --> 00:17:45.556
See? That's why I keep
you around,Jane.


274
00:17:45.658 --> 00:17:47.956
I mean, who else could finish my sentences?

275
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.960
Your design meeting
is at 11:00.


276
00:17:50.062 --> 00:17:53.031
And the 92nd Street Y called to confirm
that you'll be attending their benefit.


277
00:17:53.132 --> 00:17:55.100
- You wanna go?
- Do I have to make a speech?


278
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:58.329
Just a few words about ecologically
responsible business practices.


279
00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:00.405
Something light and fun.
You in?


280
00:18:00.506 --> 00:18:02.497
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.
Put it on the calendar...


281
00:18:02.608 --> 00:18:04.906
but I'm probably gonna need
to dig up a date for that, huh?


282
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:07.707
- Yeah. Probably.
- At least that's the one thing in my life...


283
00:18:07.813 --> 00:18:10.714
-you don't have to take care of for me, right?
- Yeah.


284
00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:15.981
Oh, my... God!

285
00:18:16.088 --> 00:18:18.147
<i>- Leave me alone.
- Jane!</i>


286
00:18:18.257 --> 00:18:21.158
- Yeah?
- Did you put that breakfast burrito on my desk?


287
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.160
I just thought
you might be hungry.


288
00:18:23.262 --> 00:18:25.355
That's why I love ya.

289
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.430
I love you too.

290
00:18:29.535 --> 00:18:32.732
Oh! Yeah.

291
00:18:32.838 --> 00:18:34.863
Yeah. You're right.
I needed that.


292
00:18:38.844 --> 00:18:41.745
<i>Okay, everybody. I hope to see you all
at my engagement party tonight.</i>


293
00:18:41.847 --> 00:18:44.907
<i>And,Jane, thanks again
for arranging everything.</i>


294
00:18:45.017 --> 00:18:47.247
No problem.

295
00:18:48.621 --> 00:18:51.920
Do you wanna come over
to my place before the party?


296
00:18:52.024 --> 00:18:53.992
Some of the guys from Shipping
are coming...


297
00:18:54.093 --> 00:18:56.960
- and they're bringing tequila and bubble wrap.
- Fun!


298
00:18:57.063 --> 00:18:59.258
I can't. I gotta pick up
Tess from the airport.


299
00:18:59.365 --> 00:19:03.802
God! Wouldn't it be great if there was
a service that you could hire to do that?


300
00:19:03.903 --> 00:19:07.930
Like yellow cars or shiny
black sedans--


301
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.031
I want to pick her up.
She's my baby sister.


302
00:19:10.142 --> 00:19:12.110
Plus, she needs
my help, so--


303
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:16.739
- See ya.
- Wouldn't wanna be ya.


304
00:19:25.825 --> 00:19:28.055
Hi!

305
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.596
Yea!

306
00:19:31.697 --> 00:19:33.756
Hey! When did you start
traveling so lightly?


307
00:19:33.866 --> 00:19:36.630
Oh.

308
00:19:36.736 --> 00:19:38.670
I always meet the nicest
people on planes.


309
00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:41.672
Hmm. Come on.
Parked in P-9.


310
00:19:44.944 --> 00:19:47.970
Rudolfo said he wanted to come back
to New York with me, of course...


311
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.105
but I told him that
I needed space, you know?


312
00:19:50.216 --> 00:19:53.208
<i>Spazio, Rudolfo!
Spazio.</i>


313
00:19:53.319 --> 00:19:57.551
Oh! This is so tiny
and cute. I love it.


314
00:19:59.992 --> 00:20:02.051
Ah. Feels so good
to be home.


315
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:04.356
Six months away
feels like forever.


316
00:20:08.267 --> 00:20:10.735
<i>Mom was my age,you know?</i>

317
00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:14.328
<i>- Almost to the day.
- Yeah.</i>


318
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.408
It was the perfect wedding--

319
00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:20.411
The Boathouse, the big band,
ceremony at sunset.


320
00:20:20.513 --> 00:20:22.481
Except that dress.

321
00:20:22.581 --> 00:20:25.516
<i>I mean, the synthetic lace
and the inverted box pleats.</i>


322
00:20:25.618 --> 00:20:27.813
I think it was perfect.

323
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.515
- Well, they really did love each other.
- Yeah.


324
00:20:31.624 --> 00:20:34.457
<i>What are these?
Wedding announcements?</i>


325
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.721
I'm-- No. They're just--
I was--


326
00:20:36.829 --> 00:20:38.797
Excuse me. I was going
to recycle them.


327
00:20:38.898 --> 00:20:41.264
Well, excuse me.
Into what? Wallpaper?


328
00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:43.733
It's just this one guy.

329
00:20:43.836 --> 00:20:47.272
Malcolm Doyle-- I only keep his.
He writes the best ones.


330
00:20:47.373 --> 00:20:51.002
I just-- I love the stories--
The crazy proposals...


331
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.578
<i>the engagements.</i>

332
00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:57.672
Yeah. Never mind. It's not really your thing.
So, um, how long you stayin'?


333
00:20:57.783 --> 00:21:02.982
Um, a week or two 'cause the fall fashion
shows are done, so I don't have much work.


334
00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:07.048
Speaking of work. I am meeting up with some
people from the office tonight for a party.


335
00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:11.061
<i>- You wanna come?
- Actually, I'm having drinks
with some friends from Milan.</i>


336
00:21:11.163 --> 00:21:13.131
All right. So, let me
get this straight.


337
00:21:13.232 --> 00:21:15.928
You would rather go have drinks
with Italian models...


338
00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:18.401
than come to my awesome
work party?


339
00:21:18.504 --> 00:21:20.904
- Weird, huh?
- Yeah.


340
00:21:21.006 --> 00:21:22.906
- But I'll try to make it.
- Well, thanks.


341
00:21:23.008 --> 00:21:25.602
Grey Goose is in the freezer.
Red Bull's on top of the 'fridge.


342
00:21:25.711 --> 00:21:28.441
<i>-In the cupboard there are--
- Strawberry Pop Tarts.Jinx!</i>


343
00:21:28.547 --> 00:21:30.674
<i>I said it first. 
I beat you.</i>

344
00:21:35.955 --> 00:21:38.924
<i>- St. Marks and A.
- You got it.</i>


345
00:21:42.128 --> 00:21:44.494
<i>- Hi, Gina.
- Hey, George.</i>


346
00:21:44.597 --> 00:21:46.565
<i>- Great party.
- Thanks for comin'.</i>


347
00:21:48.667 --> 00:21:52.763
<i>- You got them champagne glasses
and a bottle of Cristal.
- Good.</i>


348
00:21:52.872 --> 00:21:55.898
All right. Any way she's gonna believe
that it actually came from me?


349
00:21:56.008 --> 00:21:59.000
- Maybe. I wrapped it like a car ran over it.
- Nice. Nice touch.


350
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:01.705
Ah, look. I'm gonna go to the bar,
get a couple of drinks.


351
00:22:01.814 --> 00:22:04.009
You guys need anything.
A little liquid courage?


352
00:22:04.116 --> 00:22:06.243
Maybe some hair of the dog for you?

353
00:22:06.352 --> 00:22:09.412
I'm good. Thanks.

354
00:22:09.522 --> 00:22:14.755
He asks if you want a drink,
you smile and you say, "Vodka soda."


355
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.591
If you already have a drink, you down it. Then
there's some flirting, some interoffice sex...


356
00:22:18.697 --> 00:22:22.155
an accidental pregnancy,
a shotgun wedding and a life of bliss.


357
00:22:22.268 --> 00:22:24.668
<i>How many times do we
have to go over this?</i>


358
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.068
<i>- I don't want him
to think I'm irresponsible.
- Hey, guys.</i>


359
00:22:27.173 --> 00:22:29.232
Yeah. That's what guys want,
responsible. Mmm!


360
00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:31.969
You're wrong. George appreciates
me for the way I am.


361
00:22:32.077 --> 00:22:34.568
What good is it being
appreciated if no one is naked?


362
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.080
<i>Hey,Jane. Look.
By the way...</i>


363
00:22:37.183 --> 00:22:40.346
did you get that thing
I left on your desk this morning?


364
00:22:40.453 --> 00:22:44.287
- O-On my desk?
- Yeah. Was that okay?


365
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.121
- Okay? It was great.
- Okay. Good. Good.


366
00:22:48.227 --> 00:22:51.924
'Cause, you know, we haven't really
had that kind of relationship before...


367
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:55.159
so I just wanted to make sure
you were okay with it.


368
00:22:55.267 --> 00:22:57.997
<i>- George!
- All right. Excuse me.</i>


369
00:22:59.638 --> 00:23:03.506
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
He gave me flowers. He gave me flowers.


370
00:23:03.609 --> 00:23:05.907
Okay. Stop it. This is real life.
This is not a fantasy.


371
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:07.979
You have to go over there
and tell him how you feel.


372
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.777
Okay. It's now or never,
so-- so now.


373
00:23:11.884 --> 00:23:14.682
- Now, now. Go. Now!
- Yeah.


374
00:23:25.231 --> 00:23:28.564
<i>Whoo!</i>

375
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.355
-Jane.
- Sorry.


376
00:23:51.457 --> 00:23:56.724
George, this is my sister, Tess. Tess, this is
my George-- No! I didn't mean it like that.


377
00:23:56.829 --> 00:23:58.990
Jane is my assistant.
Kind of like my right hand.


378
00:23:59.098 --> 00:24:01.498
Lucky her.

379
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.431
Yeah.

380
00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:06.096
It's kind of like whatever I need,
she takes care of.


381
00:24:06.205 --> 00:24:09.197
As if I don't take enough
advantage of her already...


382
00:24:09.308 --> 00:24:12.402
I even dropped my dry cleaning
slip off on her desk today.


383
00:24:12.511 --> 00:24:15.344
Your dry cleaning slip.

384
00:24:15.447 --> 00:24:18.541
- It was an emergency, so--
- Of course.


385
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:20.619
Good fluff-and-fold
is no joking matter.


386
00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:23.745
Yeah. Especially when you're
down to your last pair of socks.


387
00:24:23.856 --> 00:24:26.051
Right.

388
00:24:28.661 --> 00:24:31.357
- You wanna get a drink?
- Mm-hmm.


389
00:24:31.463 --> 00:24:33.363
Came to have a drink
with my sister.


390
00:24:33.465 --> 00:24:35.729
<i>Janey?</i>

391
00:24:36.969 --> 00:24:39.301
Hi. How are ya?

392
00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:42.169
Were the flowers too much?

393
00:24:42.274 --> 00:24:44.799
- They're from you.
- Uh-huh.


394
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.107
You sent them.
The angry marriage-hater.


395
00:24:48.213 --> 00:24:51.341
Oh, that's--That's such...
good news.


396
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.941
Good news. Hey, Kev,
can you hold this for one sec?


397
00:24:54.053 --> 00:24:57.147
- Uh, sure.
- Thanks.


398
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.885
Motherf--

399
00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:10.091
<i>Why? Why?</i>

400
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:15.831
Oh.

401
00:25:15.941 --> 00:25:18.603
I'm so sorry.

402
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:22.738
Congratulations.

403
00:25:22.848 --> 00:25:24.816
Fifty. Wow. That's--

404
00:25:32.524 --> 00:25:35.322
I'm sorry.
You were saying.


405
00:25:35.427 --> 00:25:38.954
Uh, I just asked
if you'd got my flowers.


406
00:25:39.064 --> 00:25:42.295
Oh, and I have
something for you.


407
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:44.426
<i>I wanted to give you-</i>

408
00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:47.471
- Here you are.
- Oh, my God. Thank God.


409
00:25:47.573 --> 00:25:50.667
Yeah. You left it in the cab.
It was either the engagement party tonight...


410
00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:53.210
or Thursday's bikini wax,
so-- I thought that--


411
00:25:53.312 --> 00:25:56.145
- You read it?
- Yeah. Well, no. I tried to read it.


412
00:25:56.248 --> 00:25:59.979
It was very hard. All your little notes
in the little cramped handwriting.


413
00:26:00.085 --> 00:26:03.816
It's very Unabomber. You know, they do have
these Space Age computer date books now...


414
00:26:03.922 --> 00:26:05.913
- that take care of everything for you.
- Oh, yes.


415
00:26:06.025 --> 00:26:09.188
- I don't need to be taken care of. Thank you.
- Uh, have a drink with me.


416
00:26:09.294 --> 00:26:11.728
- Yeah?
- Uh, you know--


417
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.163
<i>Thank you for bringing back
my Filofax. That was very nice.</i>


418
00:26:15.267 --> 00:26:18.703
It's a drink. It's not a week in Oahu.
Come on. It'll take the edge off.


419
00:26:18.804 --> 00:26:20.704
Come on.Just one drink.

420
00:26:20.806 --> 00:26:23.969
I'm sorry. I'm really not
gonna be very much...


421
00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:26.044
fun tonight.

422
00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:29.945
Got it. Totally got it. So maybe
I'll bump into you on Thursday.


423
00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:32.017
Maybe not. I'll see
you around.


424
00:26:34.553 --> 00:26:36.817
Who was that? And where
can I get one?


425
00:26:36.922 --> 00:26:38.890
Is he coming back?

426
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:41.551
That's freakin' insane. 
I could never do that.

427
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.560
- No, no.
- You didn't eat it?


428
00:26:46.365 --> 00:26:49.493
Oh, my God.
I didn't even see it. I promise.


429
00:26:49.601 --> 00:26:53.731
It's late. You must be exhausted.
Let's--You wanna--


430
00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:57.707
- Let's go dancing.
- What? No. I don't-- George, you don't wanna--


431
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.040
Yeah. No. I'll go.
Okay.


432
00:27:00.145 --> 00:27:03.114
- Yeah, but I gotta warn you.
I'm a terrible dancer.
- Come on.


433
00:27:03.215 --> 00:27:05.911
No. It's true. In fact, on several occasions,
they've had to call the paramedics.


434
00:27:06.018 --> 00:27:09.419
- You wanna come too,Jane?
- Um--


435
00:27:10.322 --> 00:27:13.382
No, no. You guys go.

436
00:27:13.492 --> 00:27:16.689
- Have a good time.
- Okay. Let's go.


437
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.913
Go to sleep,Jane.

438
00:27:46.024 --> 00:27:49.619
Go to sleep.

439
00:27:54.733 --> 00:27:58.567
<i># Well, sometimes
I go out by myself #</i>


440
00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.629
<i>#And I look across
the water #</i>


441
00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:07.410
<i>#And I think of all the things
what you're doin'#</i>


442
00:28:07.513 --> 00:28:11.074
<i>#And in my head
I paint a picture #</i>


443
00:28:12.951 --> 00:28:15.078
<i># 'Cause since I come home #</i>

444
00:28:15.187 --> 00:28:17.678
<i># Well, my body's been
a mess #</i>


445
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.815
<i>#And I miss your tender hair #</i>

446
00:28:19.925 --> 00:28:22.519
<i>#And the way
you like to dress #</i>


447
00:28:22.628 --> 00:28:24.994
<i>#Oh, won't you come on over #</i>

448
00:28:25.097 --> 00:28:29.158
<i>#Stop making a fool
out of me #</i>


449
00:28:29.268 --> 00:28:34.137
<i># Why don't you come on over,
Valerie ##</i>


450
00:28:34.239 --> 00:28:36.935
Oh, hi, Tess.
How was your date? Nice? What?


451
00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:39.203
You talked about me
the whole time?


452
00:28:39.311 --> 00:28:41.802
Don't feel bad. I'm a really important
part of his life.


453
00:28:41.914 --> 00:28:44.644
We spend every hour,
every day together.


454
00:28:46.952 --> 00:28:49.716
<i>- Hey! Still up?
- Hi.</i>


455
00:28:49.822 --> 00:28:54.191
<i>Yeah. Yeah,just doin' a little bit of cleaning.
Harnessing my chi.</i>


456
00:28:54.293 --> 00:28:57.888
Janey, I had...

457
00:28:57.996 --> 00:29:00.521
the best night ever.

458
00:29:00.632 --> 00:29:03.226
<i>Oh, that's right!
I totally forgot you went out.</i>


459
00:29:03.335 --> 00:29:05.633
- Ow!
- Is that weird for you?


460
00:29:05.737 --> 00:29:09.400
What? Weird? Why would it be weird?
He's my boss. I don't care. Whatever.


461
00:29:09.508 --> 00:29:12.306
- Okay. Great. 'Cause we're
having lunch tomorrow.
- That's so great!


462
00:29:12.411 --> 00:29:15.380
<i>Yeah. I think so too.
Except not quite at that decibel.</i>


463
00:29:17.349 --> 00:29:20.443
So tell me about George.

464
00:29:20.552 --> 00:29:23.749
Oh. Well. I--

465
00:29:25.591 --> 00:29:27.559
Uh, he, uh--

466
00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:31.652
Well, he dropped
out of college...


467
00:29:31.763 --> 00:29:35.062
<i>and then climbed
every major peak in the world.</i>


468
00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:37.135
And then he started Urban Everest
from his apartment...


469
00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:40.967
and turned it into one of the most eco-friendly
philanthropic businesses in the world--


470
00:29:41.073 --> 00:29:43.041
all before he was 30.

471
00:29:43.141 --> 00:29:45.041
- Wow.
- Yeah.


472
00:29:45.143 --> 00:29:48.010
And that's just his resume.
He is an unbelievable boss.
Everybody loves him. Everybody.


473
00:29:48.113 --> 00:29:50.707
And he loves his dog, Gatsby,
more than anyone.


474
00:29:50.816 --> 00:29:52.943
He doesn't eat red meat,
which is kinda cool.


475
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:56.782
And he would rather spend
all his time outside than anywhere else.


476
00:29:56.889 --> 00:29:59.289
My God.
He sounds amazing.


477
00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.054
Yeah. Yeah, but he has flaws.
He does.


478
00:30:04.162 --> 00:30:06.062
He is flawed.

479
00:30:06.164 --> 00:30:10.692
- What do you mean?
- Well, he hates cashews...


480
00:30:10.802 --> 00:30:12.770
which is weird.

481
00:30:12.871 --> 00:30:15.931
And sometimes he doesn't
wear socks with sneakers.


482
00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:18.236
I just think that's gross.

483
00:30:18.343 --> 00:30:21.403
Jane.Jane, those aren't
exactly deal-breakers.


484
00:30:21.513 --> 00:30:24.744
Deal. Wh
-What deal?

485
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.650
I mean, nothing happened
between the two of you tonight, did it?


486
00:30:28.754 --> 00:30:31.314
- Did it?
- Well.


487
00:30:31.423 --> 00:30:35.382
<i>Oh. I got ya. Nice.</i>

488
00:30:35.494 --> 00:30:37.689
Mmm. Fun.

489
00:30:37.796 --> 00:30:40.162
Sounds fun.

490
00:30:45.103 --> 00:30:48.630
- Dad?
- Oh, hey, sweetie.


491
00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.765
<i>How are you? Oh,
you didn't have to--</i>


492
00:30:50.876 --> 00:30:55.245
Tessie! Oh! Oh!

493
00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:57.781
- Hi.
- Look at you.


494
00:30:57.883 --> 00:31:01.819
Oh, Dad. This place
looks exactly the same.


495
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.820
Now that's not fair.

496
00:31:03.922 --> 00:31:07.915
I got a brand-new awning. I just stripped
and re-varnished all the woodwork. Look.


497
00:31:08.026 --> 00:31:10.324
- New cash register. Digital.
- Oh.


498
00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:12.989
Wow, Dad. I'm sorry.
I don't know how I missed all these...


499
00:31:13.098 --> 00:31:14.998
remarkable improvements.

500
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.660
<i>Give me that. 
Let's go upstairs.</i>

501
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:20.461
<i>There we go.</i>

502
00:31:20.572 --> 00:31:22.802
<i>Dad, aren't we a little
old for these?</i>


503
00:31:22.908 --> 00:31:25.138
- No.
- Good, 'cause I love 'em!


504
00:31:25.243 --> 00:31:28.303
So, Tess, how long you here for?

505
00:31:30.148 --> 00:31:32.116
One to two weeks, right?
That's what you said.


506
00:31:32.217 --> 00:31:36.313
Um, actually, it just depends
on how a few things pan out.


507
00:31:36.421 --> 00:31:39.322
What things?

508
00:31:39.424 --> 00:31:42.518
What
-What
-What few things? What's--

509
00:31:46.398 --> 00:31:49.993
<i>- Hello? Hi!
- Let me guess.</i>


510
00:31:50.102 --> 00:31:52.229
<i>Some new guy is chasing
after her?</i>


511
00:31:52.337 --> 00:31:56.501
I wouldn't call it
"chasing."


512
00:31:57.609 --> 00:32:00.544
<i>- Oh, George. I would love to.
-Jane?</i>


513
00:32:00.645 --> 00:32:02.840
- What?
- You okay?


514
00:32:02.948 --> 00:32:06.509
Yeah! Oh, yeah. Great.
Fine. Everything's fine.


515
00:32:09.354 --> 00:32:13.051
<i>Of course.</i>

516
00:32:16.128 --> 00:32:18.028
I gotta stop.

517
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.170
She's gonna call me.
I guarantee it.


518
00:32:27.272 --> 00:32:30.264
- I got a way of making
the ladies reach out to me.
- Oh, yeah. How?


519
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.109
Oh, God.

520
00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:40.283
Whoo! Ah. "Yello."

521
00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:43.013
You ripped a week out of my planner.
Are you insane?


522
00:32:43.121 --> 00:32:46.955
It's a little experiment. See how you do
without every second of your life mapped out.


523
00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:49.254
By the way,
your life is insane.


524
00:32:49.361 --> 00:32:51.522
What do you do besides
work and help people get married?


525
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.098
You know what? I don't see how
that's any of your business.


526
00:32:54.199 --> 00:32:56.099
How do you afford
these weddings?


527
00:32:56.201 --> 00:32:58.726
I mean, the dresses, the airfares,
the wine of the month clubs?


528
00:32:58.837 --> 00:33:00.862
Hey, people love that gift.
And I'm a frequent member.


529
00:33:00.972 --> 00:33:03.702
So sometimes they throw in
a free gewurztraminer.


530
00:33:03.809 --> 00:33:06.505
Wow. That is terribly sad.
I'm sorry about that.


531
00:33:06.611 --> 00:33:08.476
Ah. Well, look. I wanna
make it up to you.


532
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.640
Okay? How about a new date book
or maybe just a date?


533
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.809
Uh, yeah. Sure.
Let me just pencil you in.


534
00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:17.047
Except, hey! You already did.
Every Saturday for the rest of the year.


535
00:33:17.155 --> 00:33:20.454
You know what? Can you please, please
find someone else to be creepy with?


536
00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:23.357
Nope. Tell you what. Anytime
you wanna hang out with somebody...


537
00:33:23.462 --> 00:33:26.295
who doesn't need you to take them
to a fitting or a cake-tasting...


538
00:33:26.398 --> 00:33:28.889
or a coed mojito and burrito rehearsal dinner,
just give me a call.


539
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.094
Yeah. Okay.

540
00:33:32.204 --> 00:33:34.570
Oh, God.

541
00:33:36.708 --> 00:33:39.108
- Hey!
- Hey!


542
00:33:39.211 --> 00:33:41.304
- Are we getting too old for hugs?
- No.


543
00:33:41.413 --> 00:33:43.381
Thank you.

544
00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:45.450
<i>There he is.</i>

545
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.144
<i>- Pedro. How's it goin'?
- Hey, what's up?</i>


546
00:33:48.253 --> 00:33:52.713
- So Pedro is my, uh--
- I'm his little brother.


547
00:33:52.824 --> 00:33:55.793
From the Big Brother
Program at the Y.


548
00:33:55.894 --> 00:33:59.762
- Oh.
- Pedro, Tess happens to be Jane's sister.


549
00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:03.426
<i>- Oh.
- Hola, Pedro.</i>


550
00:34:04.903 --> 00:34:08.930
Yeah. Um, look,Jane,
Tess and I...


551
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.338
<i>are gonna take Pedro to his baseball game
if you wanna join us.</i>


552
00:34:11.443 --> 00:34:13.843
I can't. I've got so much work to do.
I should stay here.


553
00:34:13.945 --> 00:34:16.175
Are you kidding me,Jane?
Look, your boss is a jerk anyhow.


554
00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:19.148
- Let's go. I don't wanna have to fire you.
- Okay.


555
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:22.186
<i>All right?
All right. Let's go.</i>


556
00:34:26.057 --> 00:34:28.218
- Hey. How you doin'?
- All right.


557
00:34:28.326 --> 00:34:31.295
Let me get three Diet Pepsis,
three fries and--


558
00:34:31.396 --> 00:34:33.830
- Chili dog. You want a chili dog?
- Uh, no.


559
00:34:33.932 --> 00:34:37.834
- Not unless it's a tofu dog with meatless chili.
- I'm sorry. What?


560
00:34:37.936 --> 00:34:40.700
- You're a vegetarian?
- Uh-huh. It's recent.


561
00:34:40.805 --> 00:34:43.740
- Oh, is it?
- You know, 'cause I'm a vegetarian too.


562
00:34:43.842 --> 00:34:46.333
- Oh.
- I used to be a vegan,
but it was too much of a hassle.


563
00:34:46.444 --> 00:34:49.709
Oh, God. I know. I mean, even being
a vegetarian is a challenge.


564
00:34:49.814 --> 00:34:53.716
I mean, every time I go hiking, I have
to bring my homemade "to furky jerky."


565
00:34:53.818 --> 00:34:56.480
You go hiking?
I mean, no offense...


566
00:34:56.588 --> 00:34:59.648
but you hardly seem like the kind of girl
that hits the trails--


567
00:34:59.758 --> 00:35:01.749
Especially
in those shoes.


568
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.023
Don't be silly. The best "to furky"
is made by publicists in kitten heels.


569
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.826
I can see how you would think that,
but I actually love...


570
00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:09.833
all that outdoorsy
type of stuff--


571
00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:13.701
You know, hiking and biking
and climbing up things.


572
00:35:13.805 --> 00:35:19.505
But, to tell you the truth, I haven't been
hiking since--Well, since my dog died.


573
00:35:19.611 --> 00:35:22.205
See Jane and I had this
dog growing up, Tory.


574
00:35:22.314 --> 00:35:24.214
I just-
- I loved him.

575
00:35:24.316 --> 00:35:29.549
He would just go on nature hikes
and climbing adventures.


576
00:35:29.654 --> 00:35:33.886
Not a day goes by that I don't think about
that bag of fleas.


577
00:35:33.992 --> 00:35:36.893
Good ol' Tory.

578
00:35:36.995 --> 00:35:40.089
Jane, how come you never
mentioned Tory?


579
00:35:40.198 --> 00:35:44.635
<i>I don't know. I must have
repressed the memory of Toby.</i>


580
00:35:46.304 --> 00:35:51.071
Yeah. His name was "Toby," but I called him
"Tory" because I had a lisp.


581
00:35:51.176 --> 00:35:54.373
A lisp that turned
your "B's" to "R's"?


582
00:35:54.479 --> 00:35:56.413
You know what?
When I was a kid, I had a stutter.


583
00:35:56.514 --> 00:35:58.482
No way!

584
00:35:58.583 --> 00:36:01.711
- We have more things
in common than I thought.
- Yeah, me too.


585
00:36:06.591 --> 00:36:09.458
I'm gonna go out and shag
some flies with Pedro.


586
00:36:09.561 --> 00:36:13.156
Ooh! I'm jealous. 
It sounds fun.

587
00:36:14.566 --> 00:36:16.466
- What are "shagging flies"?
- What are you doing?


588
00:36:16.568 --> 00:36:19.162
- What?
- You hate dogs and tofu and being outside.


589
00:36:19.271 --> 00:36:23.207
No. I like yachts. I like flowers.
I like, you know, tanning.


590
00:36:23.308 --> 00:36:26.141
- I mean, it's not exactly the same--
- And you hated Toby.


591
00:36:26.244 --> 00:36:29.270
You hated him. The only animals you ever
cared about are dead ones with sleeves.


592
00:36:29.381 --> 00:36:33.374
You're just saying all this stuff
because George is so... attractive.


593
00:36:33.485 --> 00:36:36.477
- Or some people think he is.
- I did not hate that dog.


594
00:36:36.588 --> 00:36:38.488
I just hated it
when he slobbered on me.


595
00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:43.186
And I could like soy milk
and hiking if I tried it. Maybe.


596
00:36:44.963 --> 00:36:47.955
Hey, Tess. What do you say
you come out here. Let's see that arm.


597
00:36:48.066 --> 00:36:51.467
Ooh. Fun. Are we gonna shag now?

598
00:36:54.639 --> 00:36:57.199
- Ever done this before?
- No. I don't know how to do this.


599
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:58.936
- Here you go.
- Okay. Like that?


600
00:36:59.044 --> 00:37:01.638
Put this arm down there. All right?
Hold that elbow up.


601
00:37:01.746 --> 00:37:04.544
<i>- Okay.
- All right. Hold it there.</i>


602
00:37:04.649 --> 00:37:06.617
Hi.

603
00:37:06.718 --> 00:37:09.881
Thank you.
Thank you.


604
00:37:13.825 --> 00:37:16.953
<i>- Oh.
- #I'm in like with you #</i>


605
00:37:17.062 --> 00:37:18.962
- "Love, George."
- Ah.


606
00:37:19.064 --> 00:37:22.556
<i>#Not in love with you
quite yet #</i>


607

608
00:37:25.503 --> 00:37:27.528
Oh, that's terrific.

609

614
00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:47.323
Wouldn't that be great?

615
00:37:53.865 --> 00:37:56.197
<i># 'Cause I might need

616

<i>#Mmm,yeah #</i>

624
00:38:24.062 --> 00:38:28.123
You know that in sign language,
this means "I love you."


625
00:38:28.233 --> 00:38:32.761
<i>- #But I haven't fallen in quite yet #

626

634
00:38:56.227 --> 00:38:58.923
- Which one sucks less?
- This one.


635
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.488
- Good. Maybe, uh, would you mind again?
- Nope.


636
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.068
- Thank you.
- I do it for my dad all the time.


637
00:39:07.405 --> 00:39:09.805
You okay? You seem
a little bit nervous.


638
00:39:09.908 --> 00:39:13.571
Yeah. No. I'm cool.

639
00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.108
- How's it look?
- Great.


640
00:39:19.217 --> 00:39:21.344

- Thank you.


641
00:40:02.994 --> 00:40:06.122
Oh, hey. Guys, guys! Hold it.
She's not the one. She's not the one.


642
00:40:06.231 --> 00:40:11.225
<i>Hey.Jane.</i>

643
00:40:11.336 --> 00:40:16.069
I'm so sorry. I should've called,
but you forgot your wallet.


644
00:40:16.174 --> 00:40:19.803
Oh. Well, thanks.

645
00:40:19.911 --> 00:40:22.243
Sorry I'm late.

646
00:40:22.347 --> 00:40:25.976
Hey, guys. Now, now.

647
00:40:26.084 --> 00:40:30.418
Jane, what's going on?

648
00:40:33.558 --> 00:40:35.685
Come here, boy.

649
00:40:35.793 --> 00:40:37.920
Golly. Here you go.

650
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.535
- Oh!
- Hey, Tess.


651
00:40:45.637 --> 00:40:47.764
- Sorry.
- Um--


652
00:40:47.872 --> 00:40:50.500
Will you do me a favor?
Sit down a second.


653
00:40:50.608 --> 00:40:53.406
Okay.

654
00:40:56.014 --> 00:41:01.884
<i>So, Tess. My parents met playing hopscotch
when they were, like, eight years old...</i>


655
00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:04.580
<i>and they were married
for 42 years.</i>


656
00:41:04.689 --> 00:41:09.126
And I've been waiting my whole life
to feel the way my dad felt about my mom.


657
00:41:09.227 --> 00:41:12.560
<i>And maybe I've been too busy
trying to make something of myself...</i>


658
00:41:12.664 --> 00:41:15.030
<i>- but, I think I...
- Oh!</i>


659
00:41:15.133 --> 00:41:17.192
<i>missed some
of those moments.</i>


660
00:41:17.302 --> 00:41:19.293
<i>- But, Tess, the second that I saw you...
- Okay.</i>


661
00:41:19.404 --> 00:41:22.601
<i>I knew that we could
be great together.</i>


662
00:41:22.707 --> 00:41:25.301
So, um--

663
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.436
Tess, will you marry me?

664
00:41:28.546 --> 00:41:31.982
Yes, of course I will.

665
00:41:32.083 --> 00:41:34.916
George.

666
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.124
So, wait. Does this mean
that you're moving back here?


667
00:41:45.229 --> 00:41:47.993
Yup.

668
00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:51.000
Whoa. Well, I-- I don't know what to say.
You give Jane a job...


669
00:41:51.102 --> 00:41:53.832
<i>then you get Tessie
to move back home.</i>


670
00:41:53.938 --> 00:41:56.702
George, you're my hero.
I mean it.


671
00:41:56.808 --> 00:42:00.141
Oh, thank you. You have a couple
of pretty great girls here.


672
00:42:01.613 --> 00:42:04.411
Wait.Just a second. I wanna get somethin'.
Don't go anywhere.


673
00:42:06.584 --> 00:42:09.348
<i>Who isn't?</i>

674
00:42:09.454 --> 00:42:11.581
<i>I'm so excited
that we did this today.</i>


675
00:42:11.689 --> 00:42:14.817
<i>- He's so happy.
- Tess.</i>


676
00:42:14.926 --> 00:42:18.259
Daddy!

677
00:42:18.363 --> 00:42:21.958
- Your mother would've wanted you to have it.
- Daddy, thank you!


678
00:42:22.066 --> 00:42:24.000
<i>Okay.</i>

679
00:42:24.102 --> 00:42:27.594
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay.</i>


680
00:42:27.705 --> 00:42:30.868
-Jane, you don't mind, right?
- No. No.


681
00:42:30.975 --> 00:42:35.036
- You can have it after me.
- No. That's good. It's right.
Mom would've wanted that.


682
00:42:35.146 --> 00:42:37.580
- Yeah. Mom would've wanted that.
- That's my Jane.


683
00:42:37.682 --> 00:42:39.741
Okay. Yeah.
That's right.


684
00:42:39.851 --> 00:42:43.514
It was my mother's.

685
00:42:43.621 --> 00:42:46.522
- Isn't that amazing?
- That's beautiful.


686
00:42:46.624 --> 00:42:50.287
Dad, I don't even know
what to say.


687
00:42:51.896 --> 00:42:54.990
<i>Uh, so I'm just trying to figure out why
you decided to meet with me.</i>


688
00:42:55.099 --> 00:42:57.067
You've been ducking me
and then, all of a sudden--


689
00:42:57.168 --> 00:42:59.693
My little sister's
getting married.


690
00:42:59.804 --> 00:43:01.897
- Ah, before you.
- That's not what I'm upset about.


691
00:43:02.006 --> 00:43:03.837
Then what are you
upset about?


692
00:43:03.941 --> 00:43:07.604
You don't know Tess.
She's gonna want me to do everything.


693
00:43:07.712 --> 00:43:09.646
I'm not gonna just be
her maid of honor.


694
00:43:09.747 --> 00:43:12.477
I'm gonna be taking care
of everything.


695
00:43:12.583 --> 00:43:14.881
- So why don't you just say, "No"?
- What?


696
00:43:14.986 --> 00:43:17.352
Say, "No."

697
00:43:17.455 --> 00:43:21.414
- You have said, "No," to people before?
- Yes. Of course.


698
00:43:21.526 --> 00:43:25.553
Many, many times.
In this situation, never. Not once.


699
00:43:25.663 --> 00:43:28.291
Ah, but you want
to say, "No."


700
00:43:28.399 --> 00:43:30.560
But I can't.
It's my sister.


701
00:43:30.668 --> 00:43:33.330
But you can say, "No."
Because it's your sister--


702
00:43:33.438 --> 00:43:36.236
All right. You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna practice.


703
00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.774
All right? We're gonna practice saying, "No."
You think I'm kidding?


704
00:43:38.876 --> 00:43:41.208
Turn around. We're gonna play this game.
Come on. Humor me.


705
00:43:41.312 --> 00:43:43.837
All right.Jane,
give me 50 bucks.


706
00:43:43.948 --> 00:43:47.349
- No!
-Jane, it's 50 bucks. I'll pay you back.


707
00:43:47.452 --> 00:43:51.047
No.

708
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.023
Jane, I need you...

709
00:43:55.126 --> 00:43:57.117
to give me 50 bucks.

710
00:43:59.097 --> 00:44:01.895
No?

711
00:44:01.999 --> 00:44:04.160
Eh, not bad.

712
00:44:04.268 --> 00:44:06.498
- Can I have your drink?
- Sure.


713
00:44:06.604 --> 00:44:08.504
No!

714
00:44:08.606 --> 00:44:12.167
- Oh, no.
- You were doing so well.


715
00:44:12.276 --> 00:44:14.540
- That's terrible.
- Mm-hmm.


716
00:44:14.712 --> 00:44:17.943
<i>- So you went by the flower shop
and ordered the favors?
- Yup.</i>


717
00:44:18.049 --> 00:44:19.949
- Uh-huh.
- What about the invitation mock-ups?


718
00:44:20.051 --> 00:44:22.042
- Done.
- This is so much fun!


719
00:44:24.155 --> 00:44:26.521
Did I tell you I asked Julie
to be one of the bridesmaids?


720
00:44:26.624 --> 00:44:29.525
- Who?
- Cousin Julie. Second cousin twice removed.


721
00:44:31.362 --> 00:44:33.523
- What about Mimi? Cousin Mimi?
- Oh, no way.


722
00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:37.226
She's so pregnant. It'll just throw
off the aesthetics.


723
00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:39.701
I'm sorry. I know
you don't love Julie.


724
00:44:39.804 --> 00:44:42.295
What's not to love about
a woman who asked me if I chaired...


725
00:44:42.406 --> 00:44:45.239
the Itty Bitty Titty Committee
all through my teen years?


726
00:44:45.343 --> 00:44:49.780
Just don't listen to her. Your boobs came
in eventually. They just missed high school.


727
00:44:49.881 --> 00:44:52.349
As for the third bridesmaid,
I want you to ask your friend...


728
00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.441
- that really rude one.
- Casey?


729
00:44:54.552 --> 00:44:56.986
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- My Casey?


730
00:44:57.088 --> 00:44:59.352
She's really pretty.
She can pull off the strapless.


731
00:44:59.457 --> 00:45:02.483
I don't have that many girlfriends.
For some reason, girls just don't like me.


732
00:45:02.593 --> 00:45:04.993
I don't know why.

733
00:45:05.096 --> 00:45:07.758
Okay. Fine. I know why.
Will you just ask her?


734
00:45:10.802 --> 00:45:12.770
Sure. Of course.

735
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:16.033
So I was also thinking we could
do a slide show for the rehearsal dinner.


736
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.473
You know, put pictures of George
and I together and say funny things.


737
00:45:19.577 --> 00:45:22.842
- Okay.
- Oh, and guess what.
That writer you obsess about...


738
00:45:22.947 --> 00:45:25.780
<i>he wants to do a whole Commitments
column on us in the Journal.</i>


739
00:45:25.883 --> 00:45:27.817
He called me.
Can you believe it?


740
00:45:27.919 --> 00:45:29.910
At this point,
I absolutely can.


741
00:45:30.021 --> 00:45:33.320
Listen, um, I've been thinking a lot about
what you said, and I think you're right.


742
00:45:33.424 --> 00:45:37.258
I think it would be so special if I did
a wedding just like Mom and Dad's.


743
00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:41.161
-Just like?
- You know, especially since
I'm wearing Mom's dress.


744
00:45:41.265 --> 00:45:44.029
So, ta-da!

745
00:45:44.135 --> 00:45:47.571
<i>- The Boathouse?
- Uh-huh.</i>


746
00:45:47.672 --> 00:45:51.073
At first, when I called, they said they had
no availability for 18 months.


747
00:45:51.175 --> 00:45:54.076
But then the ninth time I called,
they said they had a cancellation.


748
00:45:54.178 --> 00:45:56.874
Apparently the bride slept
with the groom's father and brother...


749
00:45:56.981 --> 00:45:59.074
and sister
and all these people.


750
00:45:59.183 --> 00:46:02.311
So, obviously, it got canceled
and they were all devastated.


751
00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.388
But which means...

752
00:46:04.488 --> 00:46:06.649
we're getting married
in three weeks.


753
00:46:06.757 --> 00:46:08.748
Three weeks?

754
00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.522
Uh-huh. Oh,Jane. I know
you can pull it together quickly.


755
00:46:11.629 --> 00:46:14.325
And I didn't wanna wait
that long anyway, so--


756
00:46:19.537 --> 00:46:21.505
Uh, you could be a little
excited for me.


757
00:46:21.606 --> 00:46:25.906
No, I am. I am.
It's just--


758
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.945
It's just that you wanted to get married
at The Boathouse in Mom's dress too.


759
00:46:29.046 --> 00:46:32.413
I know.

760
00:46:32.516 --> 00:46:35.644
No, I just-- I didn't know that
that's what you wanted...


761
00:46:35.753 --> 00:46:38.517
but if it is, then I just want
you to be happy.


762
00:46:38.623 --> 00:46:40.750
- You know that.
- Great!


763
00:46:40.858 --> 00:46:43.258
Okay. Now can we talk about
more important stuff?


764
00:46:43.361 --> 00:46:47.229
Come on. I really don't like the linens,
and I think we need to rent new ones...


765
00:46:47.331 --> 00:46:50.232
because they do not go with the color
scheme that I picked out.


766
00:46:50.334 --> 00:46:52.768
That selfish whore.

767
00:46:53.838 --> 00:46:55.897
<i>- Namaste.
- Namaste.</i>


768
00:46:56.007 --> 00:46:57.907
I can't believe it.
I cannot believe it.


769
00:46:58.009 --> 00:47:01.035
There is no man that won't fall for her.
Even a do-gooder like George.


770
00:47:01.145 --> 00:47:05.809
<i>Men just become hypnotized by her voodoo
and they lose their minds.</i>


771
00:47:05.917 --> 00:47:09.409
You can't plan your sister's
wedding to the man you love. It's sick.


772
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.647
To be fair, she didn't
know how I felt about him.


773
00:47:11.756 --> 00:47:14.384
And nor should she--
He's my boss.


774
00:47:14.492 --> 00:47:17.859
I'm just gonna have to get over it.
I don't really have a choice.


775
00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:19.930
And neither do you.

776
00:47:20.031 --> 00:47:21.555
She wants you to be
a bridesmaid.


777
00:47:21.666 --> 00:47:24.066
You are shitting me.

778
00:47:24.168 --> 00:47:25.726
- Hello?
- Please.


779
00:47:25.836 --> 00:47:28.771
No. No, I won't do it,
on principle.


780
00:47:28.873 --> 00:47:32.775
I say, "No," on principle.
No. You can count me out.


781
00:47:32.877 --> 00:47:35.971
Please. Please don't
leave me alone in this.


782
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.173
- Please, please, please.
- Fine. Fine.


783
00:47:38.282 --> 00:47:41.581
Because it's you. But if she crosses me,
I'm gonna kick her ass.


784
00:47:41.686 --> 00:47:44.917
And then I will kick your ass.
Then I'm gonna have a couple drinks--


785
00:47:47.792 --> 00:47:51.956
There's no sign
that says, "No talking."


786
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.833
<i>Three weeks?
It cannot be done.</i>


787
00:47:59.937 --> 00:48:03.373
<i>- It is not enough time for one of my creations!
- Okay, um...</i>


788
00:48:03.474 --> 00:48:07.467
Antoine, remember when I
brought you the Schecters...


789
00:48:07.578 --> 00:48:10.775
and they commissioned that six-tiered,
heart-shaped masterpiece?


790
00:48:10.881 --> 00:48:13.543
Then, of course,
the tower of edible gifts...


791
00:48:13.651 --> 00:48:15.642
for the Schifman-Guardino
outdoor fiesta.


792
00:48:15.753 --> 00:48:18.779
You can do anything,
and we both know it.


793
00:48:18.889 --> 00:48:21.790
You're gonna do the cake,
and you're gonna do it in three weeks...


794
00:48:21.892 --> 00:48:24.360
- and I would like a discount, please.
- Three weeks?


795
00:48:24.462 --> 00:48:27.056
- It pleases me.
- Delightful.


796
00:48:27.164 --> 00:48:30.156
<i>We have a cake.</i>

797
00:48:31.736 --> 00:48:34.705
- What are you doing here?
- Hi. I'm Malcolm Doyle.


798
00:48:34.805 --> 00:48:38.673
- What?
- Oh, yes. I didn't wanna
believe it till you were here.


799
00:48:38.776 --> 00:48:41.836
<i>- Um, this is my fiance, George.
- Hi. Congratulations...</i>


800
00:48:41.946 --> 00:48:44.574
<i>- to the both of you.
- Thank you.</i>


801
00:48:44.682 --> 00:48:46.741
Oh. Babe, I gotta
take this. All right?


802
00:48:46.851 --> 00:48:48.876
<i>- Okay.
- If there's a cake emergency...</i>


803
00:48:48.986 --> 00:48:51.147
I'm right over here.

804
00:48:51.255 --> 00:48:52.916
Oh, and this is Jane,
my sister.


805
00:48:53.024 --> 00:48:55.584
She's obsessed with your stories.

806
00:48:55.693 --> 00:48:58.423
- She keeps them, but pretends
she doesn't, but she does.
- Okay.


807
00:48:58.529 --> 00:49:00.827
<i>She's your number one fan.</i>

808
00:49:00.931 --> 00:49:02.831
Not in a creepy way though.

809
00:49:02.933 --> 00:49:06.994
- Right.
- You said your name was "Kevin."


810
00:49:07.104 --> 00:49:09.595
As in "Kevin."

811
00:49:09.707 --> 00:49:12.767
Well, I use "Malcolm" for the byline
so I don't get stalked by crazy brides.


812
00:49:12.877 --> 00:49:15.641
- So how did you meet George?
- You're an asshole.


813
00:49:15.746 --> 00:49:18.180
-Jane.
- What? I'm sorry. He said his name was "Kevin."


814
00:49:18.282 --> 00:49:21.410
- I'm just-- I'm a little bit confused.
- Wait.


815
00:49:21.519 --> 00:49:26.081
- You guys know each other?
- Well, we both work the wedding circuit, so--


816
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.126
Can you just give us one second?
I'm just gonna-- over-- for one second...


817
00:49:30.227 --> 00:49:32.195
talk to-- talk about you.

818
00:49:32.296 --> 00:49:35.129
Antoine.

819
00:49:35.232 --> 00:49:37.132
You lied to me.

820
00:49:37.234 --> 00:49:40.032
No. I told you I was a writer.
I didn't tell you what I wrote.


821
00:49:40.137 --> 00:49:44.801
But-- But you write
the most beautiful things.


822
00:49:44.909 --> 00:49:47.742
Do you actually believe in love
and marriage and pretend to be a cynic...


823
00:49:47.845 --> 00:49:52.145
or are you a cynic who knows how to spin
romantic crap for girls like me?


824
00:49:52.249 --> 00:49:56.151
I didn't follow that at all. But I think
the second one, the spinning crap one.


825
00:49:56.253 --> 00:50:01.418
Oh, my God. I feel like I found out my favorite
love song was written about a sandwich.


826
00:50:01.525 --> 00:50:04.983
<i>Um, can I steal you away
to tell you about George and me?</i>


827
00:50:05.096 --> 00:50:07.087
Of course. Of course.
That's why I'm here.


828
00:50:32.857 --> 00:50:35.724
What? Tess is not here.

829
00:50:35.826 --> 00:50:39.489
- I'm here to see you.
- Why?


830
00:50:39.597 --> 00:50:43.033
<i>Come on. I have to talk
to all of the friends and family.</i>


831
00:50:43.134 --> 00:50:46.467
<i>It'll take five minutes.
Please?</i>


832
00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:50.028
For George and Tess?

833
00:50:50.141 --> 00:50:52.041
Well, okay.

834
00:50:53.144 --> 00:50:56.011
Thank you.

835
00:50:56.113 --> 00:50:58.604
- May I come in?
-Just ask me what you wanna ask me.


836
00:50:58.716 --> 00:51:02.015
- Or would you prefer to lie some more?
- I didn't lie to you.


837
00:51:02.119 --> 00:51:04.144
I don't know why
you keep saying that.


838
00:51:04.255 --> 00:51:06.917
- I may have left out a couple of things.
- Can we just get this over with?


839
00:51:07.024 --> 00:51:10.824
The maid of honor
is a peculiar young woman.


840
00:51:10.928 --> 00:51:14.989
So tell me how you feel
about Tess's whirlwind romance.


841
00:51:15.099 --> 00:51:17.067
I couldn't be happier.
She's my kid sister.


842
00:51:17.168 --> 00:51:19.363
I taught her how to tell time,
how to ride a bike...


843
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.370
how to steam flounder
in the dishwasher.


844
00:51:21.472 --> 00:51:25.067
I mean, I practically raised her--
Oh, please, don't print that.


845
00:51:25.176 --> 00:51:28.407
That would kill my father.

846
00:51:28.512 --> 00:51:30.980
Wait. What are those?

847
00:51:32.082 --> 00:51:34.642
Nothing.

848
00:51:34.752 --> 00:51:36.652
- Are those--
- No!


849
00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:43.319
- Are they bridesmaid dresses?
- This is none of your business.


850
00:51:43.427 --> 00:51:46.794
Oh! Good God.

851
00:51:46.897 --> 00:51:49.730
What? You kept them all?
You have a whole closet full. Why?


852
00:51:49.833 --> 00:51:52.495
I have a lot of friends
and I like to keep them.


853
00:51:52.603 --> 00:51:55.197
Right. Well, that makes
complete sense...


854
00:51:55.306 --> 00:51:57.866
- because they're beautiful.
- Some are not that bad.


855
00:51:57.975 --> 00:52:00.375
"Not that bad"? I'd like to see one of them
that's not that bad.


856
00:52:00.477 --> 00:52:02.411
Fine.

857
00:52:02.513 --> 00:52:05.311
Um, well--
Not that one.


858
00:52:05.416 --> 00:52:09.216
This one--
This one is really--


859
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.288
Horrible. Right?
Was the word you're looking for.


860
00:52:11.388 --> 00:52:13.447
What color is this? Vomit?

861
00:52:13.557 --> 00:52:15.684
No, it's like a-- It's an "olivey" green.
It's very in.


862
00:52:15.793 --> 00:52:17.693
I'm telling you,
it looks great on.


863
00:52:17.795 --> 00:52:20.992
Uh, no. I'm telling you
that this is an instrument of torture...


864
00:52:21.098 --> 00:52:23.362
inflicted on you by a bride
who wants you to look ugly.


865
00:52:23.467 --> 00:52:26.402
No.Jenna picked it
because it looks good on everybody.


866
00:52:26.503 --> 00:52:29.768
Slightly delusional and will believe
anything anyone tells her.


867
00:52:29.873 --> 00:52:33.138
That is not true and I'm going
to show you you are wrong.


868
00:52:46.257 --> 00:52:48.157
See?

869
00:52:48.259 --> 00:52:52.719
It's not so bad.
This sash is really very flat--


870
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:55.424
Okay. You are totally right
about the dress. It is not that bad.


871
00:52:55.532 --> 00:52:57.500
But, come on.
The color? Please.


872
00:52:57.601 --> 00:53:02.095
Well, it's your flash.
I think it's blowing it out weird...


873
00:53:02.206 --> 00:53:04.333
and if it were just a normal--
Okay, it's not very good.


874
00:53:04.441 --> 00:53:07.069
You kind of look
like a shiny mermaid.


875
00:53:09.213 --> 00:53:12.512
You should be flattered. She didn't want
to stand next to a tall, beautiful woman...


876
00:53:12.616 --> 00:53:14.880
and have you actually
looking decent.


877
00:53:14.985 --> 00:53:19.354
It's really not the worst one.

878
00:53:19.456 --> 00:53:21.617
<i>If I had to pick one--
I got a good one.</i>


879
00:53:25.696 --> 00:53:28.460
- This is my favorite.
- Oh, my God.


880
00:53:28.565 --> 00:53:30.533
- What the hell is that?
- Theme wedding.


881
00:53:30.634 --> 00:53:34.536
What was the theme, "humiliation"? God!

882
00:53:34.638 --> 00:53:37.698
<i>- No, people do not have
Gone With The Wind weddings.
- I have been to three.</i>


883
00:53:37.808 --> 00:53:40.504
<i>- Let's do it.
- All right.</i>


884
00:53:40.611 --> 00:53:42.602
<i>- Y'all say, "Diddly-dee."
- Diddly-dee.</i>


885
00:53:42.713 --> 00:53:44.544
<i>Oh!</i>

886
00:53:46.583 --> 00:53:49.051
I feel sick. All right. What else you got?
Show me some more.


887
00:53:50.287 --> 00:53:53.484
Okay. Okay.

888
00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.058
- You have to show me Benihana.
- Give it.


889
00:53:59.063 --> 00:54:01.054
<i># You ain't got the crime
'Cause she ain't got #</i>


890
00:54:01.165 --> 00:54:04.066
<i>#Nothing' on you #</i>

891
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:09.432
<i>Aha!</i>

892
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.531
Very pretty.
Do you feel pretty?


893
00:54:11.642 --> 00:54:14.805
<i>Adorable.</i>

894
00:54:15.779 --> 00:54:18.714
Every bride loves
her accessories.


895
00:54:18.816 --> 00:54:22.013
Men wore dresses. 
Women wore suits.

896
00:54:27.624 --> 00:54:30.923
Whoa!

897
00:54:35.499 --> 00:54:36.989
<i>- Kevin?
- Yup.</i>


898
00:54:37.101 --> 00:54:39.228
Oh!

899
00:54:39.336 --> 00:54:41.236
Um--

900
00:54:41.338 --> 00:54:43.499
What was the theme here?

901
00:54:43.607 --> 00:54:45.837
L.A. Wedding.

902
00:54:45.943 --> 00:54:49.037
<i># You gotta party
If you're feeling hearty #</i>


903
00:54:49.146 --> 00:54:52.377
<i>#She's in love now #</i>

904
00:54:59.656 --> 00:55:02.955
<i># Would you rather see #</i>

905
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.258
<i># That you know
Yeah #</i>


906
00:55:07.364 --> 00:55:10.026
<i>#Come on #</i>

907
00:55:22.246 --> 00:55:25.306
Twenty-seven dresses.
You gotta be kidding me.


908
00:55:25.416 --> 00:55:28.613
I don't get it. All right. You--
You do the thing, you have the dress.


909
00:55:28.719 --> 00:55:31.119
Just throw it out.
That's a huge closet.


910
00:55:31.221 --> 00:55:33.314
You live in New York.
You cannot be eating up space like that.


911
00:55:33.424 --> 00:55:36.621
Strange as it sounds, I've had some
really good times in those dresses.


912
00:55:36.727 --> 00:55:38.752
- Weird as that may be.
- I don't believe you.


913
00:55:38.862 --> 00:55:41.262
<i>I don't care if somebody wants me
to wear a funny dress.</i>


914
00:55:41.365 --> 00:55:44.061
- It's their day, not mine.
- God bless you.


915
00:55:44.168 --> 00:55:46.728
<i>And if supporting them
when they get married means...</i>


916
00:55:46.837 --> 00:55:49.135
snowshoeing to a mountaintop
in the Alps or...


917
00:55:49.239 --> 00:55:52.936
<i>- helping to caulk a fountain
for some swans, then-
- You actually did that?</i>


918
00:55:53.043 --> 00:55:56.911
Oh, I'm a really,
very good caulker.


919
00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:02.476
Likes caulk.

920
00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:04.645
All right.
But come on. Seriously.


921
00:56:04.755 --> 00:56:07.349
I mean, how much time do you spend
doing this for other people?


922
00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:09.483
What about--What about you?
You don't have any needs?


923
00:56:09.593 --> 00:56:11.993
No, I don't.
I'm Jesus.


924
00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:18.258
Someday-- God knows when--
But someday...


925
00:56:18.368 --> 00:56:20.268
it'll be my day.

926
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.066
<i>And then all those people
will be there for me. So--</i>


927
00:56:23.173 --> 00:56:25.334
<i>That is if I ever--</i>

928
00:56:25.442 --> 00:56:27.740
Sorry.

929
00:56:33.951 --> 00:56:35.851
You don't get it.

930
00:56:35.953 --> 00:56:37.887
<i>That's fine.
Why would you?</i>


931
00:57:06.984 --> 00:57:09.282
Hey. I need
your registry list.


932
00:57:09.386 --> 00:57:11.820
I thought you were
gonna wait downstairs.


933
00:57:15.492 --> 00:57:17.483
What is that?

934
00:57:17.594 --> 00:57:20.062
- George is in Telluride. Who's in here?
- No one.


935
00:57:20.163 --> 00:57:21.425
- Let's talk in the hall.
- Tess.


936
00:57:21.532 --> 00:57:24.023
Jane--

937
00:57:24.134 --> 00:57:26.193
He was looking for
a part-time job.


938
00:57:26.303 --> 00:57:29.204
He's...
cleaning the apartment.


939
00:57:29.306 --> 00:57:31.240
<i>- # Oh, boy #
- Look, don't tell George.</i>


940
00:57:31.341 --> 00:57:33.241
<i>It's Pedro
and my little secret, okay?</i>


941
00:57:33.343 --> 00:57:36.506
<i>#I don't really know
what I'm doing ##</i>


942
00:57:36.613 --> 00:57:38.274
Kevin!

943
00:57:38.382 --> 00:57:41.010
That bridesmaid story--
what do you have so far?


944
00:57:41.118 --> 00:57:43.882
Uh, it's a little rough.
I'm still workin' on it.


945
00:57:43.987 --> 00:57:45.955
- I want to see it.
- I'm not even--


946
00:57:46.056 --> 00:57:51.358
<i>- Right now. E-mail it.
- It's not-I'm not
finished with it. It's not done.</i>


947
00:57:59.336 --> 00:58:01.566
<i>Can you go away, please?
I did not invite you.</i>


948
00:58:01.672 --> 00:58:06.200
Well, luckily Tess did. When I cover
a wedding, I gotta see every aspect.


949
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:08.938
You know, your sister wants so many
presents from so many stores...


950
00:58:09.046 --> 00:58:11.276
that she physically cannot register
for them all herself.


951
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:14.282
She's pressed for time. 
It's a short engagement.

952
00:58:14.384 --> 00:58:16.443
Good God.
Another one?


953
00:58:16.553 --> 00:58:18.453
To you, it's just
another casserole dish.


954
00:58:18.555 --> 00:58:21.149
To Tess, it's the pot she's gonna
cook my mother's Christmas roast in.


955
00:58:21.258 --> 00:58:23.726
Oh, Tess cooks?

956
00:58:23.827 --> 00:58:26.193
All right. Well, I'm gonna cook it.
But Tess will be there...


957
00:58:26.296 --> 00:58:28.196
with George.

958
00:58:28.298 --> 00:58:30.323
- And this isn't just another "vahze."
- Vase.


959
00:58:30.434 --> 00:58:33.028
This is the "vahze"
that Tess will get out...


960
00:58:33.136 --> 00:58:36.867
when George brings home flowers,
just because he felt like it.


961
00:58:36.974 --> 00:58:39.169
I see. And this--

962
00:58:39.276 --> 00:58:44.077
this is the rooster-shaped umbrella holder
that will hold all of George's umbrellas.


963
00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:46.672
Fine. Be a jerk.

964
00:58:46.783 --> 00:58:49.752
All I'm saying
is that this isn't just stuff.


965
00:58:49.853 --> 00:58:52.083
<i>- These are the things
that make up a life together.
- No.</i>


966
00:58:52.189 --> 00:58:55.920
This is the useless crap that the

967
00:58:56.026 --> 00:58:58.790
has convinced us all that we have
to have or we won't be happy.


968
00:58:58.895 --> 00:59:02.194
<i>You know what I think?
I think that all your statistics and theories...</i>


969
00:59:02.299 --> 00:59:04.324
are just
a smoke screen.


970
00:59:04.434 --> 00:59:07.835
- Oh, really? For what?
- Your little secret--whatever it is.


971
00:59:07.938 --> 00:59:10.839
Your parents got divorced.
You haven't found the right girl.


972
00:59:10.941 --> 00:59:13.205
- You're afraid you never will.
- Mm-hmm.


973
00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:15.210
And I think
you love weddings so much...


974
00:59:15.312 --> 00:59:19.146
because you'd rather focus on other people's
Kodak moments than make memories of your own.


975
00:59:19.249 --> 00:59:22.650
You're right. Know why? Because weddings are
the perfect place to forget about being single.


976
00:59:22.753 --> 00:59:25.278
I think you want a wedding--
not a marriage, a wedding.


977
00:59:25.389 --> 00:59:27.983
What is your problem?

978
00:59:28.091 --> 00:59:31.219
Did you have your own fancy wedding
and your wife left you or something?


979
00:59:32.462 --> 00:59:34.694
Bingo.

980
00:59:34.798 --> 00:59:36.698
What?

981
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.700
With my roommate from college,
by the way.


982
00:59:38.802 --> 00:59:40.861
So I think you get
an extra bingo for that.


983
00:59:42.939 --> 00:59:45.965
Oh, shit.
Kevin, I'm--


984
00:59:46.076 --> 00:59:48.544
I'm so sorry. It was just--
It was a guess.


985
00:59:48.645 --> 00:59:50.545
<i>It was a good one.</i>

986
00:59:50.647 --> 00:59:53.480
For someone who has
no insight whatsoever into herself...


987
00:59:53.583 --> 00:59:55.483
you nailed me
right on the head.


988
00:59:57.254 --> 01:00:00.052
Want to find the ugliest stuff in the store
and register Tess for it?


989
01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.260
Let's do it.

990
01:00:15.472 --> 01:00:17.372
Wow.

991
01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:20.102
<i>- I told you I was not done with it yet.
- No, it's good.</i>


992
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.405
I meant,
"Wow, it's actually decent."


993
01:00:22.512 --> 01:00:25.208
<i>I have to admit,
I was shocked...</i>


994
01:00:25.315 --> 01:00:29.081
<i>but, uh, it's smart
and, uh, biting...</i>


995
01:00:29.186 --> 01:00:31.086
and actually entertaining
as hell.


996
01:00:31.188 --> 01:00:34.180
<i>- Well, thank you.
- You really nailed this girl.</i>


997
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:38.125
<i>We're running it Sunday,
front page of the section.</i>


998
01:00:38.228 --> 01:00:41.561
Um, here is where you jump up
and down with gratitude.


999
01:00:41.665 --> 01:00:44.725
Oh-- No, no, no, no.
I just--


1000
01:00:44.835 --> 01:00:47.633
I just don't think it's perfect yet.
I really want to get this right.


1001
01:00:47.738 --> 01:00:50.571
- We should just hold it a week.
- Wait. You've been begging me for months...


1002
01:00:50.674 --> 01:00:53.871
and now you want me to hold the story
so you can move some commas around?


1003
01:00:53.977 --> 01:00:57.037
I don't know. Now that I'm in it, she's more
than just this perpetual bridesmaid.


1004
01:00:57.147 --> 01:01:00.275
You know, I don't know. There's--
There's a lot more to her than that.


1005
01:01:00.383 --> 01:01:02.681
<i>Huh. If I didn't know you
any better...</i>


1006
01:01:02.786 --> 01:01:05.448
I would say that you'd
developed a little crush.


1007
01:01:05.555 --> 01:01:08.319
Very funny. Look, I know
I can make it better.


1008
01:01:08.425 --> 01:01:11.883
- It's good the way it is.
- Will you just give me a week? Just a week.


1009
01:01:11.995 --> 01:01:14.896
Fine. Get out.

1010
01:01:20.637 --> 01:01:23.504
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.


1011
01:01:23.607 --> 01:01:26.405
Oh, it's no problem.
I'm happy to help.


1012
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:29.377
And I have more experience eating
than Tess does, so you're in good hands.


1013
01:01:29.479 --> 01:01:32.971
Now, we've planned your wedding dinner
to your exact specifications.


1014
01:01:41.825 --> 01:01:44.089
-Jane's phone.
- Tess?


1015
01:01:44.194 --> 01:01:47.322
- Hey, it's Kevin.
- Hey! How is the article coming?


1016
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:50.831
Uh, I think it's gonna be a great piece.
I think you'll be very happy.


1017
01:01:50.934 --> 01:01:54.370
- I can't wait.
- Hey, listen. Any chance you know where Jane is?


1018
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:58.237
Yeah, you know, the thing that I like
about Tess is there's no bullshit.


1019
01:01:58.341 --> 01:02:01.037
You know,
she's not afraid to be herself.


1020
01:02:02.979 --> 01:02:06.608
George, about Tess--
There's something that I want to say.


1021
01:02:06.716 --> 01:02:10.447
- Um--
- What?


1022
01:02:13.323 --> 01:02:16.690
I'm just so happy for you,
that you found what you were looking for.


1023
01:02:16.793 --> 01:02:19.853
All right.
So what's your favorite part...


1024
01:02:19.963 --> 01:02:21.294
of a wedding?

1025
01:02:21.398 --> 01:02:23.423
Oh, that's easy.

1026
01:02:23.533 --> 01:02:26.093
You know when the music starts
and the bride makes her big entrance...


1027
01:02:26.203 --> 01:02:27.670
and everybody turns
to look at her?


1028
01:02:27.771 --> 01:02:30.535
That's when I look at the groom.
'Cause his face says it all.


1029
01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.871
You know,
the pure love there.


1030
01:02:33.977 --> 01:02:36.070
That's why I go.

1031
01:02:36.179 --> 01:02:39.046
<i>Okay. So when you get married
and you make your entrance...</i>


1032
01:02:39.149 --> 01:02:41.049
I have full permission
to look at the groom?


1033
01:02:41.151 --> 01:02:46.384
Yes. Please do. Please make sure the poor
sucker is still standing there.


1034
01:02:46.489 --> 01:02:49.947
<i>Are you kidding me?
Some guy would be lucky to have you.</i>


1035
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:53.928
<i>And the way that you attacked that
tomatillo before-- Who could resist that?</i>


1036
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:56.157
Very sexy.

1037
01:03:03.173 --> 01:03:05.334
<i>Doyle?</i>

1038
01:03:08.178 --> 01:03:10.078
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>


1039
01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:13.874
What are you doing here?

1040
01:03:13.984 --> 01:03:17.249
Are you guys picking out
the wedding meal?


1041
01:03:17.354 --> 01:03:21.256
- Where's Tess?
- She's... getting her hair done.


1042
01:03:22.359 --> 01:03:24.452
- I'm just helping out.
- Mm-hmm.


1043
01:03:24.561 --> 01:03:27.496
We're heading up to Rhinebeck to pick out
some linens from an antique store.


1044
01:03:27.597 --> 01:03:30.395
<i>Yeah, we really should go, because Tess
and I have dinner with my parents.</i>


1045
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.958
- Well, why don't I just go with you?
- What? No. No. That's okay.


1046
01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:37.767
Um, I can get you back on time.
I got my dad's Volvo, and that thing books.


1047
01:03:37.874 --> 01:03:39.865
All right, look. I really don't mind.
It's totally fine.


1048
01:03:39.976 --> 01:03:42.706
I got a couple more questions
to ask you anyway for the article.


1049
01:03:42.812 --> 01:03:45.406
Which I'd be happy to answer,
by phone or e-mail.


1050
01:03:45.515 --> 01:03:47.779
<i>If you wouldn't mind,
that would be a great help.</i>


1051
01:03:47.884 --> 01:03:50.114
I don't mind at all.
I insist.


1052
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:58.650
It was like a lightbulb. The second I saw you
mooning at him over polenta.


1053
01:03:58.762 --> 01:04:00.787
Of course you're upset.
You're planning your sister's wedding...


1054
01:04:00.897 --> 01:04:02.797
to the man
that you're in love with.


1055
01:04:02.899 --> 01:04:05.197
You're stuck in this
creepy little love triangle...


1056
01:04:05.302 --> 01:04:08.499
and all the while, you're about
one monogrammed party favor away
from blowing your brains out.


1057
01:04:08.605 --> 01:04:10.436
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

1058
01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:13.509
Oh, come on. Course you can't tell him
because you're Nice Jane, you're Sweet Jane.


1059
01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:15.635
You don't know
what you're talking about, okay?


1060
01:04:15.745 --> 01:04:19.841
<i>He's my boss. She's my sister.
I am thrilled to be planning
their wedding-- tickled even.</i>


1061
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:22.680
Like I have been for every wedding
that I've been a part of.


1062
01:04:22.786 --> 01:04:25.687
But you can't understand that
because you're--


1063
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:28.519
you're mean...
and dark and cynical.


1064
01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:31.025
And, well, that's your problem,
pal, not mine.


1065
01:04:31.127 --> 01:04:32.594
<i>- "Pal"? "Pal"?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.</i>


1066
01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:35.597
"Hey, pal. Pal." This is bad.
You're calling me "pal."


1067
01:04:35.699 --> 01:04:37.599
<i>Oh, will you just be quiet?</i>

1068
01:04:39.402 --> 01:04:42.337
Look, I get it. You're mad.
I just ruined the whole afternoon...


1069
01:04:42.439 --> 01:04:44.600
of you pining over somebody
that you'll never, ever have.


1070
01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:47.108
Stop it!
Just stop.


1071
01:04:48.778 --> 01:04:51.838
Okay. Would you slow down just a little bit
so I can read this sign?


1072
01:04:53.283 --> 01:04:55.774
Okay. My Spidey vision's
not working so good.


1073
01:04:55.885 --> 01:04:59.116
- Do you think you could
slow down just a little bit?
- Would you leave me alone!


1074
01:05:01.624 --> 01:05:03.956
Seriously. Crazy Lady,
we're gonna hydroplane. Slow down.


1075
01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.789
Come on.
We are not gonna hydroplane.


1076
01:05:05.895 --> 01:05:07.920
Whoa!

1077
01:05:08.031 --> 01:05:10.727
Whoa! We're hydroplaning.
We're hydroplaning!


1078
01:05:14.337 --> 01:05:17.033
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!


1079
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.370
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!


1080
01:05:24.814 --> 01:05:27.078
Don't say anything.

1081
01:05:42.932 --> 01:05:44.832
- You got anything?
- No.


1082
01:05:49.606 --> 01:05:52.439
- Uh--
- I said don't! Nothing.


1083
01:06:07.524 --> 01:06:10.084
Excuse me.
Uh, your pay phone's dead.


1084
01:06:10.193 --> 01:06:12.855
<i>Nice work. You're like one of those guys
on C.S.I.</i>


1085
01:06:14.197 --> 01:06:16.495
Uh, any chance
we could use your phone?


1086
01:06:16.599 --> 01:06:18.590
Could I get a scotch,
three fingers, no ice, please?


1087
01:06:18.701 --> 01:06:20.965
<i>- What are you doing?
- Well, it's late...</i>


1088
01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:25.064
we're not getting a tow,
and we're in East Deliverance, New York.


1089
01:06:25.175 --> 01:06:27.075
I'm gonna have a drink.

1090
01:06:29.379 --> 01:06:31.279
Come on. There's nobody
you can help right now.


1091
01:06:31.381 --> 01:06:34.976
Why don't you just sit down,
relax, have a drink? It's been a long day.


1092
01:06:35.085 --> 01:06:36.882
Here you go.

1093
01:06:38.755 --> 01:06:40.655
Fine.

1094
01:06:41.858 --> 01:06:44.452
Just one!

1095
01:06:45.662 --> 01:06:49.393
- Ah!
- Okay. February 12, 2006.


1096
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.595
The Keller wedding. You wrote a column
that moved me to tears.


1097
01:06:54.704 --> 01:06:57.298
It was downright, flat-out the most beautiful
thing I have ever read.


1098
01:06:57.407 --> 01:06:59.500
- Oh-- I don't remember it.
- How can you not remember that?


1099
01:06:59.609 --> 01:07:01.509
- I don't remember it.
- How can you not?


1100
01:07:01.611 --> 01:07:04.739
It was the anniversary of the father's death.
The brother flew home from Afghanistan.


1101
01:07:04.848 --> 01:07:07.282
- You cannot fake emotion like that.
- Oh, yes, you can.


1102
01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:10.819
- A good writer can.
- You're not that good.


1103
01:07:11.921 --> 01:07:14.822
Nice!

1104
01:07:17.327 --> 01:07:19.989
There's gotta be one thing
about weddings that you like.


1105
01:07:22.165 --> 01:07:24.065
- Open bar.
- No.


1106
01:07:25.768 --> 01:07:28.100
All right.

1107
01:07:28.204 --> 01:07:32.368
So when the bride comes in
and she makes her giant, grand entrance--


1108
01:07:32.475 --> 01:07:35.035
I like to glance back at the poor bastard
getting married.


1109
01:07:36.146 --> 01:07:38.137
'Cause even though
I think he's an idiot...


1110
01:07:38.248 --> 01:07:42.275
for willingly entering into the last
legal form of slavery...


1111
01:07:44.387 --> 01:07:46.287
he always looks
really, really happy.


1112
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.325
And, for some reason, I--

1113
01:07:50.426 --> 01:07:53.327
What the hell are you
looking at me like that for?


1114
01:07:53.429 --> 01:07:55.897
- Are you shitting me right now?
- What?


1115
01:07:55.999 --> 01:07:58.729
<i>That's my favorite part.</i>

1116
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.970
Oh, my God.
We have something in common.


1117
01:08:04.941 --> 01:08:07.739
Yes. Well, statistically
that was bound to happen.


1118
01:08:07.844 --> 01:08:10.438
Uh-huh. I think you should just admit
that you're a big softy.


1119
01:08:10.547 --> 01:08:13.744
That this whole cynical thing
is just an act so that you can seem...


1120
01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:16.717
wounded and mysterious
and sexy.


1121
01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:19.754
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that last one?
- What?


1122
01:08:19.856 --> 01:08:21.756
- Did you say sexy?
- What?


1123
01:08:21.858 --> 01:08:24.349
- Do you think I'm sexy?
- No.


1124
01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.519
- It's okay if you do. You think I'm sexy?
- I don't.


1125
01:08:26.629 --> 01:08:29.427
<i>No. I think you think you're sexy.
That's the point I'm making.</i>


1126
01:08:29.532 --> 01:08:32.262
<i>- You think I think I'm sexy?
- Yes.</i>


1127
01:08:36.172 --> 01:08:39.164
- Great song.
- I love this song.


1128
01:08:39.275 --> 01:08:42.711
# Hey, kids shake
it loose-- a lemon #

1129
01:08:42.812 --> 01:08:46.373
# Gotta make a feather #

1130
01:08:46.482 --> 01:08:49.747
- Those are not the words.
- Those are exactly the words.


1131
01:08:49.852 --> 01:08:52.514
Sorry, lyric police.
What are the words?


1132
01:08:52.622 --> 01:08:55.591
#You're gonna hear
a handsome music #


1133
01:08:55.692 --> 01:08:58.024
# So the walrus sounds #

1134
01:08:58.127 --> 01:09:00.027
"Walrus sounds"?

1135
01:09:00.129 --> 01:09:03.690
- # Say, Penny's no longer in a cement jet #
- You're scaring me.


1136
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.428
# Ooh, but you're so
laced down #


1137
01:09:06.536 --> 01:09:10.597
# Buh, buh, buh, buh
Bennie and the Jets #


1138
01:09:10.707 --> 01:09:13.699
# Ooh, in the wind
and the waterfall #


1139
01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:17.075
# Oh, baby,
she's a "revocaine" #


1140
01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.740
- # She's got electric boobs #
- Boobs?


1141
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:23.478
- #And mohair shoes #
- #You know I read it in a magazine #


1142
01:09:23.586 --> 01:09:25.486
# Oh-ho #

1143
01:09:25.588 --> 01:09:30.321
<i>- I love this song.
- #B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets #</i>


1144
01:09:35.498 --> 01:09:39.093
<i>#She's got electric boots a mohair suit #</i>

1145
01:09:39.202 --> 01:09:41.966

01:10:04.127 --> 01:10:07.153
These guys are rockin'!

1153
01:10:09.432 --> 01:10:11.332
That was cool!

1154
01:10:18.908 --> 01:10:20.876
Whoa!

1155
01:10:23.313 --> 01:10:25.213
I cried like a baby
at the Keller wedding.


1156
01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:35.923
Mmm.

1157
01:10:40.263 --> 01:10:42.163
Mmm.

1158
01:11:07.357 --> 01:11:09.257
Morning, sunshine.

1159
01:11:09.359 --> 01:11:11.657
- Hi.
- Here you go.


1160
01:11:11.761 --> 01:11:14.924
- Thank you. Mmm.
- Tow truck's on its way.


1161
01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:16.999
Okay.

1162
01:11:19.202 --> 01:11:22.000
I just want you to know--
Well, you know, I never do this.


1163
01:11:22.105 --> 01:11:26.007
- Oh, I know.
- No, really. Never. I never do this.


1164
01:11:26.109 --> 01:11:28.976
Really, I know. Last night, you kept saying it,
over and over again.


1165
01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:31.444
"I never do this. I never do this.
I never do this.


1166
01:11:31.547 --> 01:11:33.845
- I never do this. I never--"
- Okay.


1167
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:36.510
I just wanted you to know.

1168
01:11:39.956 --> 01:11:43.289
Ah.

1169
01:11:43.393 --> 01:11:46.590
<i>- No.
- No, I do. It's true.</i>


1170
01:11:46.696 --> 01:11:48.596
- Here's your order.
- Thank you.


1171
01:11:48.698 --> 01:11:50.928
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.


1172
01:11:51.033 --> 01:11:53.866
H
-H
-Hey! It's "Bennie and the Jets."

1173
01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:57.133
Re--
# B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets #


1174
01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.208
<i>#Bennie ##</i>

1175
01:11:59.308 --> 01:12:02.937
- You guys-- Oh. That was awesome.
- Oh, thanks.


1176
01:12:03.045 --> 01:12:07.106
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Okay.


1177
01:12:07.216 --> 01:12:10.242
Oh, my God. I sang "Bennie and the Jets"
last night, didn't I?


1178
01:12:10.353 --> 01:12:12.719
Mm-hmm.
Very loudly.


1179
01:12:12.822 --> 01:12:14.813
And, might I say,
you were a little pitchy.


1180
01:12:14.924 --> 01:12:16.915
- I'm sorry. Me? What about you?
- Yes.


1181
01:12:17.026 --> 01:12:19.426
- You hit notes only dogs can hear.
- What?


1182
01:12:19.529 --> 01:12:24.523
- Truly. Truly high-pitched.
- No. I was in key, a-at least though, right?


1183
01:12:24.634 --> 01:12:27.501
My God.
You're that girl.


1184
01:12:27.603 --> 01:12:29.264
Yeah, I'm Bennie.
He's the Jets.


1185
01:12:29.372 --> 01:12:32.341
Hey, it's the girl
from the paper.


1186
01:12:32.442 --> 01:12:34.103
What paper?

1187
01:12:35.778 --> 01:12:37.803
Shit.

1188
01:12:37.914 --> 01:12:40.974
<i>"Always, Always, Always
a Bridesmaid by Malcolm Doyle"?</i>


1189
01:12:41.851 --> 01:12:44.251
What is this?

1190
01:12:44.353 --> 01:12:46.617
Jane--

1191
01:12:46.722 --> 01:12:49.190
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Let me--</i>


1192
01:12:49.292 --> 01:12:51.487
<i>- Let me explain.
- Oh, my God.</i>


1193
01:12:51.594 --> 01:12:52.925
Jane--

1194
01:12:56.032 --> 01:12:57.932
Jane!

1195
01:12:58.034 --> 01:13:00.298
Look, I told my editor
not to run it.


1196
01:13:00.403 --> 01:13:02.303
Nobody reads
that section anyway.


1197
01:13:02.405 --> 01:13:04.737
<i>Come on.
Will you please just-</i>


1198
01:13:22.458 --> 01:13:24.653
What the hell happened?
You said you were gonna hold it.


1199
01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.024
Well, you don't
make those decisions. I do.


1200
01:13:27.129 --> 01:13:31.463
Oh, God. I didn't even get a chance to tell her
it was running. She was ambushed.


1201
01:13:31.567 --> 01:13:33.501
Hey, I gave you

1202
01:13:33.603 --> 01:13:36.595
The only thing you should be saying to me
right now is "I love you."


1203
01:13:46.349 --> 01:13:49.841
<i>- Oh! How could you let this happen to me?
- What?</i>


1204
01:13:49.952 --> 01:13:53.615
"If Jane is the prototypical,
accommodating bridesmaid...


1205
01:13:53.723 --> 01:13:58.387
"then her sister, Tess, is cast as the overbearing,
overindulged bride-to-be...


1206
01:13:58.494 --> 01:14:02.089
"who at any moment, one worries,
might start stomping around Manhattan...


1207
01:14:02.198 --> 01:14:05.531
breathing fire and swatting planes
from the sky."


1208
01:14:05.635 --> 01:14:08.229
I had no idea he was writing
an article about me.


1209
01:14:08.337 --> 01:14:12.774
<i>You? He called me "Bridezilla"
in the New York Frickin' Journal!</i>


1210
01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:16.709
I could tear him apart, I swear.
I could tear him apart limb from limb.


1211
01:14:19.882 --> 01:14:22.180
- What?
- Can I speak to Jane, please?


1212
01:14:22.285 --> 01:14:26.847
The only person that you're
gonna be speaking to is my attorney!


1213
01:14:26.956 --> 01:14:29.516
And I don't even have an attorney,
but I'm sure gonna get one!


1214
01:14:29.625 --> 01:14:32.355
Asshole!

1215
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:36.730
I gotta get outta here.

1216
01:14:36.832 --> 01:14:39.528
Oh, but you better alert
Traffic Control...


1217
01:14:39.635 --> 01:14:41.535
because Bridezilla's
on the loose!


1218
01:14:53.115 --> 01:14:55.174
Kevin-
- Kevin--

1219
01:14:55.284 --> 01:14:58.685
Kevin, stop calling me!

1220
01:15:04.994 --> 01:15:09.158
Before you say anything,
can you just not say anything?


1221
01:15:10.933 --> 01:15:12.924
I don't understand.

1222
01:15:13.035 --> 01:15:15.401
To what are you referring?

1223
01:15:16.472 --> 01:15:18.463
<i>Oh, come on.
It's no big deal.</i>


1224
01:15:18.574 --> 01:15:21.907
It's just an article...
on the front page of the section...


1225
01:15:22.011 --> 01:15:24.502
<i>with a million pictures
of you on it.</i>


1226
01:15:24.614 --> 01:15:27.174
<i>- Who's upset?
- Jane.</i>


1227
01:15:35.925 --> 01:15:38.985
Let me just explain.
I had no idea what he was writing.


1228
01:15:39.095 --> 01:15:42.656
- I would--
-Jane, the guy was a jerk.
Okay? He took advantage of you.


1229
01:15:42.765 --> 01:15:46.064
- Don't worry about it.
- I know. I just-- I feel
like I should've seen it coming.


1230
01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:49.433
- I'm so sorry.
- Would you please stop apologizing?


1231
01:15:49.538 --> 01:15:53.531
The only reason I called you in here was
to make sure that you're okay.


1232
01:15:54.677 --> 01:15:58.636
Oh.
Well, I've been better.


1233
01:16:00.049 --> 01:16:02.779
I'm just trying
to get through it.


1234
01:16:02.885 --> 01:16:04.819
Look. I wouldn't
worry about it, all right?


1235
01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.515
- Does anybody read that section anyhow?
- No.


1236
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:16.790
<i>So after we hem it, 
I wouldn't--</i>

1237
01:16:16.899 --> 01:16:19.231
<i>-Jane, is that you?
- Yep.</i>


1238
01:16:19.335 --> 01:16:21.667
- We'll talk about it after. Hi.
- Hi.


1239
01:16:21.771 --> 01:16:23.295
- Hi, Sue.
- Hi.


1240
01:16:23.406 --> 01:16:26.398
So, listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the article fiasco...


1241
01:16:26.509 --> 01:16:28.409
and I've decided
to forgive you.


1242
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:30.536
- Mmm.
- You're just very trusting...


1243
01:16:30.646 --> 01:16:32.773
- and it's not your fault, I guess.
- Mm-kay.


1244
01:16:32.882 --> 01:16:34.816
That's very big of you, Tess.
Thank you.


1245
01:16:34.917 --> 01:16:37.317
Wait. Are you
checking me off your list?


1246
01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.218
Um, about the slide show,
I know exactly what I want you to say.


1247
01:16:40.322 --> 01:16:43.723
So I wrote out a script. And Dad says
that you have all the family photos.


1248
01:16:43.826 --> 01:16:46.021
- Yep. Mm-hmm.
- So I'm gonna send you George's as well.


1249
01:16:46.128 --> 01:16:51.031
Um, here. Please say this
and only this.


1250
01:16:51.133 --> 01:16:54.728
- 'Cause we don't want to be embarrassed again.
- Okay. You got it.


1251
01:16:54.837 --> 01:16:56.896
Here it is.

1252
01:16:57.006 --> 01:16:59.566
- Step in.
- Okay.


1253
01:16:59.675 --> 01:17:01.575
- Yep.
- There you go.


1254
01:17:03.279 --> 01:17:06.248
<i>- It's beautiful.
- You might have to unbutton that back.</i>


1255
01:17:06.348 --> 01:17:09.181
- One second.
- Okay.


1256
01:17:10.786 --> 01:17:13.755
Perfect.
So what do you think?


1257
01:17:15.558 --> 01:17:17.583
I-- I thought
you were wearing Mom's dress.


1258
01:17:17.693 --> 01:17:21.527
It is Mom's dress.
Well, parts of it.


1259
01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:26.397
<i>It was just so old-fashioned,you know?
So we could just use a few pieces here and there.</i>


1260
01:17:26.502 --> 01:17:28.697
- Parts?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.


1261
01:17:28.804 --> 01:17:31.204
Like this,
and the lace.


1262
01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.714
You cut up
Mom's wedding dress?


1263
01:17:39.815 --> 01:17:42.477
Well, technically Mary
-Ella did.

1264
01:17:44.086 --> 01:17:45.951
But don't worry.
We saved you the rest.


1265
01:17:46.055 --> 01:17:48.546
<i>And, I mean,
if you want,you can wear this...</i>


1266
01:17:48.657 --> 01:17:52.423
<i>as long as a silhouette's
still in fashion.</i>


1267
01:17:52.528 --> 01:17:56.055
<i>Mary-Ella, I think just the bottom
needs to be hemmed a little bit.</i>


1268
01:17:56.165 --> 01:17:58.429
No. No, no, no, no.

1269
01:17:58.534 --> 01:18:01.162
No!

1270
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:03.966
Okay, fine.
You don't have to wear it.


1271
01:18:04.073 --> 01:18:06.633
God, you don't care. You don't care
about anyone but yourself, do you?


1272
01:18:06.742 --> 01:18:10.075
I have made excuses for you because Mom
died when you were little. But enough is enough!


1273
01:18:10.179 --> 01:18:13.114
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


1274
01:18:13.215 --> 01:18:15.775
I can't undo what you've just done.
But I won't let you hurt George.


1275
01:18:15.885 --> 01:18:19.252
He thinks he knows the truth about you,
but all he knows are the lies you've told him.


1276
01:18:19.355 --> 01:18:22.188
You even had Pedro
keep a secret from George.


1277
01:18:22.291 --> 01:18:24.282
You tell him the truth
right now!


1278
01:18:24.393 --> 01:18:27.521
He is not one of your Eurotrash boyfriends,
Tess. He is a good person.


1279
01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:30.292
And you cannot start a relationship
based on lies.


1280
01:18:30.399 --> 01:18:34.665
Oh, really,Jane? And you know this
because of all your successful relationships?


1281
01:18:36.205 --> 01:18:38.264
You tell him the truth,
or I will.


1282
01:18:38.374 --> 01:18:42.276
No, you won't. You wouldn't hurt a fly.
And you definitely wouldn't hurt me.


1283
01:18:42.378 --> 01:18:45.040
- I'm your sister.
- That was yesterday.


1284
01:18:45.147 --> 01:18:48.605
Today you're just some bitch who broke my
heart and cut up my mother's wedding dress.


1285
01:18:50.286 --> 01:18:52.345
Well, it wouldn't have
fit you anyway.


1286
01:19:12.474 --> 01:19:15.034
Oh,Jane.
You look wonderful.


1287
01:19:15.144 --> 01:19:17.044
Good for you.

1288
01:19:17.146 --> 01:19:21.515
Oh, honey, it must be so hard to watch
your younger sister get married before you.


1289
01:19:21.617 --> 01:19:23.983
Yes. Yes, it is.

1290
01:19:24.086 --> 01:19:27.453
But then I remember that I still get to have
hot hate sex with random strangers...


1291
01:19:27.556 --> 01:19:30.081
and I feel so much better.

1292
01:19:30.192 --> 01:19:32.092
Enjoy the party.

1293
01:19:34.563 --> 01:19:37.396
Whoo! You clean up good.
I might even be into you.


1294
01:19:37.499 --> 01:19:41.435
- Okay. It's on the desktop
under "Tess and George."
- Okay.


1295
01:19:41.537 --> 01:19:43.437
- You okay?
- Yep.


1296
01:19:44.807 --> 01:19:47.901
That's not water.
Okay.


1297
01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:49.910
Okay.

1298
01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:55.243
<i>Hi.</i>

1299
01:19:55.351 --> 01:19:58.411
-Jane, thank you so much for
doing all this. It's great.
- Sure.


1300
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.545
- Hors d'oeuvre?
- Yeah. Oh, look. Pigs in a blanket.


1301
01:20:00.656 --> 01:20:06.094
- Want one, Tess?
- No. I don't eat that stuff,Jane.


1302
01:20:09.465 --> 01:20:11.933
Right.
That's right. Got it.


1303
01:20:16.906 --> 01:20:19.739
Well, I'm gonna go
do the slide show.


1304
01:20:19.842 --> 01:20:21.867
-Jane.
- Mmm?


1305
01:20:23.345 --> 01:20:25.438
You're only gonna
say what I wrote, right?


1306
01:20:25.547 --> 01:20:29.039
Of course. The perfect bridesmaid
always does what she's asked.


1307
01:20:38.594 --> 01:20:40.585
Not getting cold feet, are you?

1308
01:20:40.696 --> 01:20:42.823
- What was that?
- With this one? Never.


1309
01:20:45.301 --> 01:20:47.394
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

1310
01:20:47.503 --> 01:20:49.403
<i>In case you haven't
already read...</i>


1311
01:20:49.505 --> 01:20:52.235
I have been to
my fair share of weddings.


1312
01:20:55.077 --> 01:20:57.307
<i>So, to start things off...</i>

1313
01:20:57.413 --> 01:21:00.314
I thought you should all know the truth
about Tess and George.


1314
01:21:07.122 --> 01:21:10.922
<i>"Tess and George
are a perfect couple.</i>


1315
01:21:11.026 --> 01:21:13.221
"No, a divine couple.

1316
01:21:13.329 --> 01:21:15.627
"A couple whose love
is the stuff of myths.


1317
01:21:15.731 --> 01:21:18.291
"Their compatibility
is so exact...


1318
01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.530
"that it can only be described
as having been designed by the gods.


1319
01:21:22.638 --> 01:21:25.937
<i>Since a picture is worth a thousand words...</i>

1320
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:28.976
I put together a slide show
so you can all see for yourselves.


1321
01:21:32.381 --> 01:21:38.149
<i>"From the very beginning, Tess and George
were destined for each other.</i>


1322
01:21:42.458 --> 01:21:45.950
<i>"George and Tess have always shared a love
of God's furry creatures.</i>


1323
01:21:49.598 --> 01:21:54.729
<i>"As they grew up, they both shared the same
level of dedication and commitment...</i>


1324
01:21:54.837 --> 01:21:58.238
"to their education.

1325
01:22:01.176 --> 01:22:04.668
<i>- Nice.
- "And civic responsibility.</i>


1326
01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:07.806
<i>- #So happy together #
- Oh, my.</i>


1327
01:22:10.319 --> 01:22:12.879
<i>"He was interested
in international affairs.</i>


1328
01:22:14.623 --> 01:22:16.022
"And so was she.

1329
01:22:16.125 --> 01:22:19.060
<i>Whoa.</i>

1330
01:22:19.161 --> 01:22:23.222
<i>"And today, Tess and George
still share the same values.</i>


1331

<i>#Me and you
and you and me #</i>


1332
01:22:28.437 --> 01:22:31.736
<i>"Their love is based
on a deep understanding...</i>


1333
01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.209

the other person really is.</i>

<i>#Bah, bah, bah, bah #</i>

1336
01:22:47.022 --> 01:22:50.583
<i>"The love of
two true soul mates...</i>


1337
01:22:50.692 --> 01:22:53.160
"Tess and George.

1338
01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:02.393
<i>So here's to the most perfect couple
brought together by destiny.</i>


1339
01:23:02.504 --> 01:23:04.665
I'm so proud of you, Baby Sister.

1340
01:23:05.707 --> 01:23:08.972
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

1341
01:23:09.078 --> 01:23:11.911
All right.
Well, that was--


1342
01:23:12.014 --> 01:23:15.541
<i>Yeah. So, um...</i>

1343
01:23:15.651 --> 01:23:20.145
to keep the merriment going,
um, George's "little brother" Pedro...


1344
01:23:20.255 --> 01:23:21.984
<i>wanted to say
a few words.</i>


1345
01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:24.082
<i>Pedro.</i>

1346
01:23:24.193 --> 01:23:27.162
So, safe to say you're not a vegetarian.

1347
01:23:27.262 --> 01:23:30.754
George, that was taken
a really long time ago.


1348
01:23:30.866 --> 01:23:33.664
Why exactly were you wearing
your engagement ring then?


1349
01:23:33.769 --> 01:23:35.669
<i>Thank you.</i>

1350
01:23:35.771 --> 01:23:37.602
As all you know,
George is my big brother.


1351
01:23:37.706 --> 01:23:40.266
But he's more than that.

1352
01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:42.275
<i>He's my best friend.</i>

1353
01:23:42.377 --> 01:23:46.814
<i>And now George has Tess, who's-
who's really-really, really cool...</i>


1354
01:23:46.915 --> 01:23:50.578
'cause she's gonna help me start
my own cleaning business.


1355
01:23:50.686 --> 01:23:53.780
<i>Oh. Tess told me
not to tell you, George.</i>


1356
01:23:53.889 --> 01:23:55.982
<i>But I'm so excited.</i>

1357
01:23:56.091 --> 01:23:58.286
<i>So I'm only doing
George's place right now.</i>


1358
01:23:58.393 --> 01:24:01.920
<i>But if anyone is in the market for
a really good cleaning service...</i>


1359
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:04.658
please see me
in the lobby.


1360
01:24:04.766 --> 01:24:06.825
Thank you.

1361
01:24:06.935 --> 01:24:09.995
- That's great.
- No, it's-- it's not. George.


1362
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.534
<i>George, wait, please.
Let me explain.</i>


1363
01:24:17.646 --> 01:24:19.876
So what happened?

1364
01:24:21.783 --> 01:24:25.651
<i>- He needed to know the truth.
- You could've told him face-to-face.</i>


1365
01:24:25.754 --> 01:24:29.281
I mean, I know that my moral compass
doesn't exactly point due north...


1366
01:24:29.391 --> 01:24:33.725
but if I say something's wrong,
something's wrong.


1367
01:24:36.031 --> 01:24:38.966
You're the one who is always telling me
to stand up for myself.


1368
01:24:39.067 --> 01:24:41.661
<i>Yeah. But that's
not what you did.</i>


1369
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:44.864
What you did was unleash 20 years
of repressed feelings in one night.


1370
01:24:44.973 --> 01:24:46.873
It was entertaining--
don't get me wrong--


1371
01:24:46.975 --> 01:24:50.638
<i>but if it was the right thing to do,
you'd feel better right now.</i>


1372
01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.148
Do you feel better
right now?


1373
01:24:56.818 --> 01:25:00.185
The wedding's off.
I hope you're happy.


1374
01:25:29.351 --> 01:25:31.376
Oh, God. What?

1375
01:25:31.486 --> 01:25:33.386
Why are you here?

1376
01:25:33.488 --> 01:25:36.013
- You wouldn't return my phone calls.
- What do you want?


1377
01:25:36.124 --> 01:25:38.354
You want another picture
for your paper?


1378
01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:42.954
-Jane, I'm sorry. Believe me.
- Please. You used me to get ahead in your career.


1379
01:25:43.065 --> 01:25:45.431
Be a man and admit it.
Or-- Or don't.


1380
01:25:45.534 --> 01:25:48.901
But please, please don't pretend
that you give a shit.


1381
01:25:49.004 --> 01:25:51.734
- Will you just please let me explain?
- No, it doesn't matter.


1382
01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.334
I just destroyed my life,
and I didn't need your help to do it.


1383
01:25:56.445 --> 01:25:58.811
Great! Finally.

1384
01:25:58.914 --> 01:26:02.077
I saw what you did in there.
And you know what? I thought it was amazing.


1385
01:26:02.184 --> 01:26:05.415
Was it absolutely, certifiably nuts?
Yes, it was. But you did something,Jane.


1386
01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.853
<i>- For the first time,you were not
just the perfect bridesmaid.
- Stop.Just please.</i>


1387
01:26:08.957 --> 01:26:12.586
I'm not doing this with you again. I don't even
know why I'm standing here talking to you.


1388
01:26:12.694 --> 01:26:15.595
You know what? Let me tell you. Look.
Come here. Listen to me.


1389
01:26:15.697 --> 01:26:19.064
Do you want to know the real
reason why I came here tonight?


1390
01:26:19.167 --> 01:26:21.192
Because I knew this was
gonna be hard for you.


1391
01:26:21.303 --> 01:26:25.467
And for the first time in a really long time,
I wanted to be there for somebody. Yeah.


1392
01:26:25.574 --> 01:26:28.975
All right. I messed up.
I did. I'm sorry.


1393
01:26:29.077 --> 01:26:31.477
And I'm gonna turn around,
I'm gonna walk away. I'm gonna vanish.


1394
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:34.549
You'll never see me again,
I promise.


1395
01:26:34.650 --> 01:26:37.744
But I want you to know
that I think you deserve--


1396
01:26:37.853 --> 01:26:41.152
I think you deserve more
than what you've settled for.


1397
01:26:41.256 --> 01:26:45.590
I do. I think you deserve to be
taken care of for a change.


1398
01:26:45.694 --> 01:26:47.787
I-
- I believe that.

1399
01:26:58.473 --> 01:27:00.373
Ah.

1400
01:27:00.475 --> 01:27:03.171
I forgot to give you this.

1401
01:27:03.278 --> 01:27:06.145
<i>It's a gift...</i>

1402
01:27:06.248 --> 01:27:09.843
so you don't have to carry around that
crazy Filofax from 1987.


1403
01:27:09.951 --> 01:27:13.682
This will take care of all
the stuff you need to do.


1404
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:16.883
Perfect for starting over.

1405
01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:26.296
Okay. Will you take it, please,
so I don't feel like such a jerk?


1406
01:27:47.489 --> 01:27:52.426
<i>#Don't let your mind

1410
01:28:18.186 --> 01:28:20.746
The story got
a phenomenal response.


1411
01:28:20.856 --> 01:28:23.984
- Looks like you got yourself
bumped from Commitments.


1412
01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.726
That's great.

1413
01:28:27.829 --> 01:28:30.320
Kevin, be happy.

1414
01:28:30.432 --> 01:28:32.957
You got what you wanted, right?

you two are sisters.</i>


1418

- I'm telling you, she doesn't want to talk.


1419
01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:55.187
No, no. She loves you.
Everything is gonna be fine.


1420
01:28:55.290 --> 01:28:57.554
- Okay. If you just--
- Dad?


1421
01:29:01.963 --> 01:29:03.931
What the hell
is she doing here?


1422
01:29:04.032 --> 01:29:06.091
Tess, this is
between you and her.


1423
01:29:06.201 --> 01:29:08.101
I'm out of this.

1424
01:29:08.203 --> 01:29:12.799
You know, Flo, have you seen the new
weed whackers we've got out front?


1425
01:29:12.908 --> 01:29:15.775
<i>The latest model.</i>

1426
01:29:19.915 --> 01:29:22.611
I feel terrible.

1427
01:29:22.717 --> 01:29:26.084
<i>- I'm so sorry for what happened--
- Sorry?</i>


1428
01:29:26.188 --> 01:29:29.385
You humiliated me in front
of every single person that I know...


1429
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:31.459
and you think
you could just say sorry?


1430
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.996
<i>- I-I know. But--
- Jane,you were always jealous of me.</i>


1431
01:29:35.096 --> 01:29:38.293
- What?
- Always! My clothes! My boyfriends!


1432
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.267
- Stop it!
- You've just been waiting
for the chance to tear me down.


1433
01:29:41.369 --> 01:29:42.802
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is!


1434
01:29:42.904 --> 01:29:46.635
- Ow!
- And you took the one thing
that was finally working out.


1435
01:29:46.741 --> 01:29:48.641
Oh, please!
This is so typical, Tess.


1436
01:29:48.743 --> 01:29:52.110
You're not taking any responsibility
for the fact that you lied to George.


1437
01:29:52.214 --> 01:29:54.114
You manipulated him.
Put down the bug spray.


1438
01:29:54.216 --> 01:29:57.276
Put down the bug spray, Tess!

1439
01:29:57.385 --> 01:30:00.013
Did you even love him?
Or was it just convenient?


1440
01:30:00.121 --> 01:30:03.352
Oh, please,Jane.
Get off your high horse.


1441
01:30:03.458 --> 01:30:05.392
<i>Just admit it.
You resent me...</i>


1442
01:30:05.494 --> 01:30:07.962
because you're the one who
always had to braid my hair...


1443
01:30:08.063 --> 01:30:11.897
and make my Halloween outfits
and go shopping for my prom dress.


1444
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.696
- No, I have never resented any of that.
- Yes, you have.


1445
01:30:14.803 --> 01:30:17.636
- You always thought that my life was so easy.
- It was!


1446
01:30:17.739 --> 01:30:20.037
It is! You have never
had a care in the world.


1447
01:30:20.141 --> 01:30:23.235
You're beautiful
and fun and charming.


1448
01:30:23.345 --> 01:30:25.870
- Your life is perfect.
- Perfect? Are you crazy?


1449
01:30:25.981 --> 01:30:27.881
You have no idea.

1450
01:30:27.983 --> 01:30:30.975
You want to know the real reason
why I decided to stay in New York?


1451
01:30:31.086 --> 01:30:33.987
I got fired from my job.

1452
01:30:34.089 --> 01:30:35.989
And to top it off,
Rudolfo dumped me.


1453
01:30:36.091 --> 01:30:39.117
He dumped me.

1454
01:30:39.227 --> 01:30:42.219
And then George came along,
and he was nice to me.


1455
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:44.821
And he treated me well,
you know?


1456
01:30:44.933 --> 01:30:49.336
And I just wanted to be
someone that he wanted.


1457
01:30:49.437 --> 01:30:51.905
<i>I was trying to be someone
who deserved him...</i>


1458
01:30:52.007 --> 01:30:55.340
someone he could respect.

1459
01:30:55.443 --> 01:30:58.105
I was trying to be you.

1460
01:30:59.814 --> 01:31:01.839
Why?

1461
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:04.919
Why would you want to be me
when you get to be you?


1462
01:31:07.556 --> 01:31:11.754
<i>- This is a mess.
- I know.</i>


1463
01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:15.227
Jane, you've been trying to take care of me
ever since Mom died.


1464
01:31:15.330 --> 01:31:18.094
- I had to.
- No, you didn't have to.


1465
01:31:19.534 --> 01:31:22.264
- But-- But if I don't then--
- But if you don't...


1466
01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:26.602
then you'll just be my sister,
which is what it should be.


1467
01:31:26.708 --> 01:31:29.643
Maybe when I was young
you needed to help me out. But now?


1468
01:31:29.744 --> 01:31:31.735
You gotta stop
taking care of me...


1469
01:31:31.846 --> 01:31:34.246
of everybody.

1470
01:32:25.567 --> 01:32:27.592
Hello? Hi.

1471
01:32:29.104 --> 01:32:31.038
Yeah.

1472
01:32:31.139 --> 01:32:33.039
Yeah. It's no problem.
No, of course.


1473
01:32:33.141 --> 01:32:36.269
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Okay. Okay, bye.


1474
01:32:50.125 --> 01:32:52.389
Wow.

1475
01:32:52.494 --> 01:32:55.327
You look--
You look great.


1476
01:32:56.931 --> 01:33:00.799
So I guess you did need to find me a date
for this benefit after all.


1477
01:33:00.902 --> 01:33:02.836
I guess so.

1478
01:33:02.937 --> 01:33:05.565
George, before we go anywhere,
I just want to apologize for last night.


1479
01:33:05.674 --> 01:33:07.574
I shouldn't have done
what I did.


1480
01:33:07.676 --> 01:33:09.769
Look, you did me a favor.

1481
01:33:09.878 --> 01:33:12.904
All right, it's not your fault I was about
to marry someone I barely knew.


1482
01:33:13.014 --> 01:33:15.608
<i>I mean, what the hell
was I thinking, right?</i>


1483
01:33:17.652 --> 01:33:21.349
- So what do you say we forget the whole thing?
- Okay. If you're sure.


1484
01:33:21.456 --> 01:33:24.687
I'm sure. Now, I hate to ask you
for another favor...


1485
01:33:24.793 --> 01:33:28.024
but I need to print up my speech for tonight,
and I cannot find the file.


1486
01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:30.427
Oh, yeah.
I can get it.


1487
01:33:30.532 --> 01:33:34.263
Jane, I am so thankful
that I could call you tonight.


1488
01:33:34.369 --> 01:33:38.066
I can always count on you.
You never say no.


1489
01:33:38.173 --> 01:33:40.607
Which I love.

1490
01:33:42.444 --> 01:33:44.674
What?

1491
01:33:44.779 --> 01:33:47.771
Well, I-
- I just meant--

1492
01:33:47.882 --> 01:33:49.782
I'm sorry. Did I--
Did I say something wrong?


1493
01:33:52.587 --> 01:33:55.112
Oh, God.

1494
01:33:55.223 --> 01:33:57.953
George, I quit.

1495
01:33:58.059 --> 01:33:59.959
Yeah.

1496
01:34:00.061 --> 01:34:02.529
<i>- I quit.
- What do you mean, you quit?</i>


1497
01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:05.793
When I came here after college, I was
blown away by this company and by you.


1498
01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:09.529
And I got so caught up in the job
that I never bothered to get my own life.


1499
01:34:09.637 --> 01:34:11.537
I think I got
too comfortable to leave.


1500
01:34:11.639 --> 01:34:15.632
Then I had to be here every day to see you
because I was so madly in love with you.


1501
01:34:17.979 --> 01:34:19.879
Yeah.
Horrible.


1502
01:34:19.981 --> 01:34:22.882
Crazy-- Crazy crush.
Crazy.


1503
01:34:24.786 --> 01:34:26.811
But you'll be fine,
George.


1504
01:34:26.921 --> 01:34:29.151
You will. You'll get somebody
in this position...


1505
01:34:29.257 --> 01:34:33.626
who will stay for two years max,
because that's what's acceptable
and appropriate for this--


1506
01:34:45.173 --> 01:34:47.073
I-- I'm sorry.
Really sorry.


1507
01:34:47.175 --> 01:34:50.838
- I don't know. It just
kind of, like, all of a sudden.
- No. It's okay.


1508
01:34:50.945 --> 01:34:54.005
I've always wanted to know
what that would feel like.


1509
01:34:54.115 --> 01:34:56.913
And?

1510
01:34:57.018 --> 01:34:59.578
- Nothin'. I didn't feel a thing.
- Ouch.


1511
01:34:59.687 --> 01:35:02.212
That hurts.

1512
01:35:02.323 --> 01:35:05.156
- May-Maybe we can give it another try. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.


1513
01:35:12.634 --> 01:35:14.659
Nope.
Not even a blip. You?


1514
01:35:14.769 --> 01:35:18.136
Mmm. If I'm being honest,
not really.


1515
01:35:18.239 --> 01:35:21.299
Yeah. That's not what it's
supposed to feel like.


1516
01:35:21.409 --> 01:35:23.400
When you're with the person
you're meant to be with...


1517
01:35:23.511 --> 01:35:25.502
<i>it should feel like--</i>

1518
01:35:25.613 --> 01:35:27.581
Wait. What is that?

1519
01:35:34.122 --> 01:35:36.056
I gotta go.

1520
01:35:39.661 --> 01:35:42.653
<i>How many sick days do you think we
can really take without getting in trouble?</i>


1521
01:35:42.764 --> 01:35:47.360
If we took four in a row, we could take a whole
week off and go down to, like, Cancun.


1522
01:35:47.468 --> 01:35:49.368
Excuse me.
Hello?


1523
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:52.405
Do you know where Kev--
um, Malcolm-- Malcolm Doyle is?


1524
01:35:52.507 --> 01:35:54.407
Yeah. He's covering
his last wedding.


1525
01:35:54.509 --> 01:35:57.342
H-Hey. You're the girl from the article.
You're famous.


1526
01:35:57.445 --> 01:35:59.504
Yeah.

1527
01:35:59.614 --> 01:36:01.514
Taxi?

1528
01:36:09.424 --> 01:36:11.688
Pier 17.

1529
01:36:12.861 --> 01:36:14.761
Oh, my God.

1530
01:36:14.863 --> 01:36:17.229
<i>Only got one dress tonight, Ziggy.
So just go.</i>


1531
01:36:17.332 --> 01:36:20.597
<i>- Oh, come on! Oh, c-- Oh.
- Just go!</i>


1532
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:32.006
- Good luck!
- Thanks, Ziggy.


1533
01:36:32.113 --> 01:36:34.206
- Where's the wedding? Okay.
- Straight down to the end.


1534
01:36:38.152 --> 01:36:40.143
Oh, good. Well, I got it.
Thank you very much.


1535
01:36:40.255 --> 01:36:42.155
- Mm-hmm. You're welcome.
- Appreciate it.


1536
01:36:46.127 --> 01:36:48.459
<i>Hey, pull it back!</i>

1537
01:36:48.563 --> 01:36:50.224
All clear!

1538
01:37:03.077 --> 01:37:05.011
Huh.

1539
01:37:09.717 --> 01:37:11.617
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.


1540
01:37:11.719 --> 01:37:14.552
<i>- You okay?
- I'm fine. Really.</i>


1541
01:37:14.656 --> 01:37:16.556
It's all good.

1542
01:37:24.032 --> 01:37:27.331
Oh, my God. No way!
No freaking way!


1543
01:37:27.435 --> 01:37:29.596
You're the girl
from the article.


1544
01:37:29.704 --> 01:37:31.604
What--What are you
doing here?


1545
01:37:31.706 --> 01:37:34.766
Um, well--
Okay.


1546
01:37:34.876 --> 01:37:38.073
Long story short.
There's this guy.


1547
01:37:38.179 --> 01:37:41.410
- Oh! Okay. Tell me more. Tell me more.
- Um--


1548
01:37:43.284 --> 01:37:45.184
<i>Kevin?</i>

1549
01:37:45.286 --> 01:37:49.484
<i>Kevin Doyle?</i>

1550
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:51.490
Oh, my God.

1551
01:37:51.592 --> 01:37:53.287
There he is.
There he is.


1552
01:37:53.394 --> 01:37:55.692
<i>Um- hi.</i>

1553
01:37:55.797 --> 01:37:58.994
<i>Uh-
Um-</i>


1554
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.034
- Come on. You can do it. Say it.
- Okay.


1555
01:38:01.135 --> 01:38:04.298
Uh, I just wanted to say...

1556
01:38:04.405 --> 01:38:06.805
that you were right about me,
about all of it.


1557
01:38:06.908 --> 01:38:10.309
I just didn't want to hear it,
especially not from you.


1558
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:12.311
<i>Uh-
Um-</i>


1559
01:38:13.614 --> 01:38:15.514
Can we get
a follow spot?


1560
01:38:17.251 --> 01:38:20.186
<i>Ah.
There you are.</i>


1561
01:38:20.288 --> 01:38:22.188
<i>Um, okay.</i>

1562
01:38:22.290 --> 01:38:25.691
Uh, Kevin, I've been waiting my whole life
for the right guy to come along...


1563
01:38:25.793 --> 01:38:28.023
and then you showed up.

1564
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:30.290
And you are nothing like
the man I imagined.


1565
01:38:30.398 --> 01:38:32.662
You're cynical...

1566
01:38:32.767 --> 01:38:36.567
and cranky
and impossible.


1567
01:38:36.671 --> 01:38:40.107
<i>But the truth is,
fighting with you...</i>


1568
01:38:40.208 --> 01:38:42.301
<i>is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.</i>


1569
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:46.642
And I think there's a very good chance
that I'm falling in love with you.


1570
01:38:49.584 --> 01:38:54.214
So... that's it.

1571
01:38:54.322 --> 01:38:58.315
That's all I had to say.
So... I'll go now.


1572
01:39:02.196 --> 01:39:04.096
Excuse me. Sorry.

1573
01:39:08.169 --> 01:39:10.262
Yeah.

1574
01:39:10.371 --> 01:39:13.397
Kevin, I just really, um--

1575
01:39:18.446 --> 01:39:21.108
Get over here.

1576
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:38.656
<i>#I wonder why it is #</i>

1577

1582
01:40:01.789 --> 01:40:04.849
So-- Tell me, what do you think
makes this wedding special?


1583
01:40:04.959 --> 01:40:08.690
<i>- Who are you?
- I write the Commitments column for the Journal.</i>


1584
01:40:08.796 --> 01:40:11.390

- It's an open bar.

<i>- Maybe I'll buy you a drink.
- Yes!</i>


1586
01:40:14.569 --> 01:40:17.094
- Hi.
- Thank you.


1587
01:40:19.407 --> 01:40:21.341
God, look at
how hot Tess looks.


1588
01:40:22.443 --> 01:40:25.469
<i>Think she'd go for me?
I am a year older.</i>


1589
01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:29.038
I don't know. I'll put in the good word
for you, big guy. All right?


1590
01:40:31.586 --> 01:40:33.781
- Hello.
- Hi.


1591
01:40:33.888 --> 01:40:37.517
Um, I'm the maid of honor.

1592
01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:40.924
I, um, live in Williamsburg
with a roommate...


1593
01:40:41.028 --> 01:40:44.987
and I just started designing my own line
of deeply fabulous handbags.


1594
01:40:45.099 --> 01:40:48.432
And I'm completely broke.
But that's okay.


1595
01:40:48.536 --> 01:40:53.473
I eat a hamburger a day,
and my idea of a pet is a rock.


1596
01:40:54.575 --> 01:40:57.203
- Well, it's very nice to meet you.
- Tess.


1597
01:40:57.311 --> 01:41:00.280
Tess. Got it.

1598
01:41:00.381 --> 01:41:03.145
Well, wait until you see the bride.
She looks gorgeous.


1599
01:41:06.888 --> 01:41:09.186
Ready?

1600
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:11.190
Everything's perfect.

1601
01:41:11.292 --> 01:41:14.591
And this dress-- the best thing is I can
shorten it and wear it again.


1602
01:41:14.695 --> 01:41:16.595
Definitely. So true.

1603
01:41:16.697 --> 01:41:18.961
All right.

1604
01:41:19.066 --> 01:41:21.728
- Okay.
- Okay.


1605
01:41:21.836 --> 01:41:24.031
Okay. Ready?

1606
01:41:24.138 --> 01:41:26.038
Yes.

1607
01:41:52.433 --> 01:41:56.062
<i>That day, I woke up
and put on my 28th dress.</i>


1608
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:59.230
<i>I went to a wedding where no one asked me
to hold the bouquet...</i>


1609
01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:03.674
<i>fold a place card or hold their dress
while they peed.</i>


1610
01:42:03.778 --> 01:42:06.576
<i>Everything was perfect.
And I didn't care...</i>


1611
01:42:06.681 --> 01:42:10.117
<i>because right then,
the only thing that mattered...</i>


1612
01:42:10.218 --> 01:42:13.847
<i>was the person waiting for me
at the end of the aisle.</i>


1613
01:42:13.955 --> 01:42:16.719
<i>And he was looking at me
the way I'd always hoped.</i>


1614
01:42:32.206 --> 01:42:34.367
So is this moment
everything you hoped for?


1615
01:42:36.077 --> 01:42:37.544
No.

1616
01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.413
It's more.
It's much more.


1617
01:42:44.051 --> 01:42:46.952
<i>Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...</i>


1618
01:42:47.054 --> 01:42:51.684
to join Jane Nichols and Kevin Doyle
in holy matrimony.


1619
01:42:51.792 --> 01:42:56.491
Marriage is a cause for celebration.

1620
01:42:56.597 --> 01:42:59.031
<i>It turns out I
was right about one thing.</i>

1621
01:43:00.635 --> 01:43:02.535
<i>I knew they'd all
be there for me someday.</i>


1622
01:43:02.637 --> 01:43:04.832
<i>#Now I really see Love #</i>

1623
01:43:07.441 --> 01:43:10.638
<i>#Has fallen on me #</i>

1624
01:43:10.745 --> 01:43:14.545
<i>#Oh, what tender love
you bring #</i>


1625
01:43:14.649 --> 01:43:18.244
<i>- #Love #
- #No, it's not a game #</i>


1626
01:43:18.352 --> 01:43:20.820
<i>#Has fallen on me #</i>

1627
01:43:20.921 --> 01:43:25.358
<i>#Oh, what tender love
you bring #</i>


1628
01:43:25.459 --> 01:43:27.723
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.


1629
01:43:27.828 --> 01:43:29.728
You may kiss the bride.

1630
01:43:31.332 --> 01:43:33.232
<i>#Hey #</i>

1631
01:43:33.334 --> 01:43:36.565
<i># What tender love
you bring #</i>


1632
01:43:36.671 --> 01:43:38.662
<i>#I fell in love with you #</i>

1633
01:43:38.773 --> 01:43:41.503
<i>#Fell in love with you #</i>

1634
01:43:41.609 --> 01:43:43.509
<i>#One day in September #</i>

1635
01:43:43.611 --> 01:43:46.978

1636

1642
01:44:08.936 --> 01:44:11.871
<i>#Love is a burning inside #</i>

1643
01:44:11.972 --> 01:44:14.600
<i>#I've never had
this feeling before, no #</i>


1644
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:18.577
<i>#All I know is that it won't
let me be myself #</i>


1645
01:44:18.679 --> 01:44:20.579
<i>#Hey #</i>

1646
01:44:20.681 --> 01:44:22.945
<i>#Is this really love #</i>

1647
01:44:23.050 --> 01:44:26.383
<i>#Oh, maybe that's the reason
I feel so good #</i>


1648
01:44:26.487 --> 01:44:28.387

1652
01:44:43.904 --> 01:44:49.274
<i>#Oh, was it way back
in September #</i>


1653
01:44:50.678 --> 01:44:55.911
<i># When you held me
in your arms #</i>


1654
01:44:56.016 --> 01:45:01.454

that you're the one for me #</i>


1655
