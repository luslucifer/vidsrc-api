00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:56.090
<i>this week's
all-new episode of.</i>


2
00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:59.210
<i>The crime annex follows the
mysterious disappearance.</i>


3
00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:00.366
<i>Of a young mother.</i>

4
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.655
<i>That rocks a
tight-knit community,</i>


5
00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:04.905
<i>Leaving them only
with questions.</i>


6
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.410
<i>But that was the last
time anyone would see.</i>


7
00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:12.353
<i>Tina Alvarez alive.</i>

8
00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:16.116
<i>In next week's episode, we'll
explore all the suspects.</i>


9
00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:18.710
<i>The police never considered.</i>

10
00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:29.946
<i>you can't avoid me
forever, Ashley.</i>


11
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:31.306
<i>If you don't call me back...</i>

12
00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.870
<i>Just please call me.</i>

13
00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:36.269
<i>I know we can fix this.</i>

14
00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:40.860
<i>tina's mother could
no longer stay silent.</i>


15
00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:42.659
<i>She knew the danger
her daughter was in.</i>


16
00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:45.773
<i>Even if Tina could
not yet recognize it.</i>


17
00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:47.221
<i>The signs were all there.</i>

18
00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.135
<i>The abusive situation.
The controlling behavior.</i>


19
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.885
<i>The nightmare voice mails.</i>

20
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.037
But Tina couldn't hear
her mother's warnings.


21
00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:56.673
<i>Despite all the signs,
Tina took him back.</i>


22
00:03:56.708 --> 00:04:00.735
<i>She had no idea the danger she
was letting back into her life.</i>


23
00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:03.647
<i>Or that he would
escalate in his tactics.</i>


24
00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:05.907
<i>Rick had started monitoring
tina's movements,</i>


25
00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:09.076
<i>Her every appointment,
every tiny errand.</i>


26
00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:10.804
<i>In the aftermath,
police discovered.</i>


27
00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.101
<i>That he even installed
spyware on her phone.</i>


28
00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:16.934
<i>There was no escaping
his watchful eye.</i>


29
00:04:17.012 --> 00:04:18.289
<i>All leading to one moment.</i>

30
00:04:18.313 --> 00:04:19.907
<i>When the authorities
arrived at tina's apartment.</i>


31
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:23.594
<i>The door was unlocked and
there was no sign of Tina.</i>


32
00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:27.415
<i>That was the last time anyone
would see Tina Alvarez alive.</i>


33
00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.323
<i>In next week's episode, we'll
explore all the suspects.</i>


34
00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:33.034
<i>The police never considered.</i>

35
00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:55.682
- Hi.
- hi.


36
00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:57.217
Ready for therapy?

37
00:04:57.293 --> 00:04:59.144
Yes, absolutely.

38
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.550
How are you doin'?

39
00:05:02.574 --> 00:05:03.574
I'm fine.

40
00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:06.226
He's been calling, but
I haven't answered.


41
00:05:06.302 --> 00:05:07.611
Good.

42
00:05:11.091 --> 00:05:12.332
I had another nightmare.

43
00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:13.728
That he broke into
the house last night.


44
00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:17.204
You need to stop listening to
true crime podcasts before bed.


45
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:20.147
But it's just getting good!

46
00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:22.408
What is happening with
the divorce lawyers?


47
00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:23.710
Any progress?

48
00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:27.380
Are you dragging
your feet on purpose?


49
00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:28.431
No.

50
00:05:28.508 --> 00:05:31.325
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it like that.


51
00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:34.095
It's just a lot all at once.

52
00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:38.577
God, lily, I swear, every
time I try to think about it,


53
00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:40.251
I just start procrastinating,

54
00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:42.815
Like a kid who can't
get their homework done.


55
00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.166
But in the meantime,
I've listened to.


56
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.316
Every true crime podcast
that's out there, so...


57
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:49.419
Have you listened
to <i>unsolved files</i>?


58
00:05:49.454 --> 00:05:51.037
No, I don't think so.

59
00:05:51.114 --> 00:05:53.907
Ah, you know what I think?

60
00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:55.759
I always know what you think.

61
00:05:55.794 --> 00:05:59.962
You always hyperfixate
on something.


62
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.355
Ever since I've known you,

63
00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:04.684
You take everything and
turn it into some...


64
00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:06.503
Giant project that consumes you.

65
00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:09.030
Do you remember study abroad?

66
00:06:09.107 --> 00:06:10.709
I thought that was
dead and buried!


67
00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:12.192
You promised!

68
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.937
And you know what your
latest project is?


69
00:06:23.972 --> 00:06:27.515
serial killers?

70
00:06:27.592 --> 00:06:28.592
Yes.

71
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.640
But it's because you'd rather
focus on something else.


72
00:06:32.664 --> 00:06:36.416
Than getting Paul out
of your life for good.


73
00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:38.159
I know. You're right.

74
00:06:39.537 --> 00:06:41.132
If you have time to
obsess over murders.


75
00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:43.156
That have already been solved.

76
00:06:43.232 --> 00:06:45.669
I have time to talk
to a divorce lawyer.


77
00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:47.460
yeah.

78
00:06:48.397 --> 00:06:49.512
All right.

79
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.799
But my caseload is gonna suffer
from this, I'm just sayin'.


80
00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:09.441
<i>Ashley, I know you're home!</i>

81
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:17.523
Come on, ash, talk to me.

82
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.350
I told you that I
didn't want you here.


83
00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:21.096
I've been trying to talk
to you for three days.


84
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.345
I got your message.

85
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.820
You're gonna keep
ignoring me, then?


86
00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:25.165
I'm not ignoring you, Paul.

87
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.769
I just... you can't
force me to talk to you.


88
00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:28.937
And you can't keep me
out of my own home.


89
00:07:33.541 --> 00:07:35.342
I wanna talk, that's all.

90
00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:37.177
She's not at your beck and call.

91
00:07:37.212 --> 00:07:38.614
Stay out of this!

92
00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:39.929
No.

93
00:07:41.474 --> 00:07:42.515
Ash, come on.

94
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.517
It's my house too.

95
00:07:46.145 --> 00:07:48.705
Please, just let me come
inside for a minute.


96
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.180
You have no idea
how hard it's been.


97
00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:52.800
I'm staying in this
total dump of a rental.


98
00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:57.079
I need to get more
clothes, and...


99
00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.074
I miss you.

100
00:08:03.054 --> 00:08:05.808
Paul, I'm asking you to leave
or I'm calling the police.


101
00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:08.875
- Don't say that.
- I'm serious. Go.


102
00:08:11.396 --> 00:08:14.247
I'll go, but I want us
to sit and talk, though.


103
00:08:14.323 --> 00:08:16.432
Soon.

104
00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.987
Promise me that?

105
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:20.428
Then talk to the lawyer.

106
00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:26.092
hell yeah.

107
00:08:26.169 --> 00:08:27.769
That felt good.

108
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.965
<i>the following is a
story from a past life.</i>


109
00:09:06.042 --> 00:09:07.374
<i>Based in truth,</i>

110
00:09:07.452 --> 00:09:11.153
<i>Slightly adjusted for
the sake of the innocent.</i>


111
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.984
<i>I'm David Bryant, and
this is unsolved files.</i>


112
00:09:19.814 --> 00:09:23.783
<i>Mary is alone.</i>

113
00:09:25.153 --> 00:09:27.806
<i>Today, she's at a party,</i>

114
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.325
<i>Surrounded by loved ones.</i>

115
00:09:30.349 --> 00:09:35.355
<i>Popular among her peers,
attractive, smart.</i>


116
00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:37.130
<i>The envy of many.</i>

117
00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:42.404
<i>But in her suffering,
she's alone.</i>


118
00:09:42.428 --> 00:09:44.949
<i>Only he knows the
truth of her pain.</i>


119
00:09:44.973 --> 00:09:48.892
<i>Because he is the reason for it.</i>

120
00:09:49.811 --> 00:09:54.772
<i>On this day, Mary is among
many who care for her,</i>


121
00:09:54.849 --> 00:09:57.669
<i>And she is utterly alone.</i>

122
00:09:57.693 --> 00:10:00.505
<i>She had put a happy
front on for so long,</i>


123
00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:04.290
<i>Giving the impression that
their marriage was a fairy tale.</i>


124
00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:07.860
<i>No one would believe that he
was capable of inflicting.</i>


125
00:10:08.013 --> 00:10:11.105
<i>The horrors on her
that she endured.</i>


126
00:10:11.182 --> 00:10:15.635
<i>But no matter how perfect
an act she performed...</i>


127
00:10:15.711 --> 00:10:18.479
<i>She could never
be perfect enough.</i>


128
00:10:18.556 --> 00:10:21.040
<i>"not him," they all said.</i>

129
00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:23.543
<i>No one could believe it.</i>

130
00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:25.528
<i>Not in this town.</i>

131
00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:28.714
<i>Not in this community.</i>

132
00:10:28.749 --> 00:10:32.352
<i>How could one of their
own be a monster?</i>


133
00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:36.416
<i>Mary is gone now.</i>

134
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.688
<i>A little boy no
longer has his mother.</i>


135
00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:44.697
<i>Her parents forced to
bury their daughter.</i>


136
00:10:44.732 --> 00:10:47.534
<i>And rick walks around free.</i>

137
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:48.885
Damn.

138
00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:52.550
<i>perhaps burdened by the
truth of what happened,</i>


139
00:10:52.574 --> 00:10:54.249
<i>But free.</i>

140
00:10:56.436 --> 00:11:01.297
<i>Ten years on and the case
remains officially...</i>


141
00:11:01.332 --> 00:11:03.341
<i>Unsolved.</i>

142
00:11:06.304 --> 00:11:09.088
<i>David Bryant, former
federal investigator.</i>


143
00:11:09.165 --> 00:11:12.200
<i>And criminal profiler
turned author.</i>


144
00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:13.662
<i>And now podcaster.</i>

145
00:11:13.686 --> 00:11:17.833
<i>Unsolved files is a fresh take
on the genre of true crime.</i>


146
00:11:17.857 --> 00:11:20.752
What made you leave
investigative work behind.


147
00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:22.284
For podcasting?

148
00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:25.679
Well, nothing haunts
an investigator more.


149
00:11:25.757 --> 00:11:27.757
Than the ones that got away.

150
00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:29.472
<i>I mean, sometimes you
know what happened,</i>


151
00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:32.361
<i>You know who's responsible.</i>

152
00:11:32.438 --> 00:11:36.449
<i>But you don't have the
proof to put them away.</i>


153
00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:41.254
<i>That's... Torture, in a sense.</i>

154
00:11:56.997 --> 00:11:57.997
Hi, marianne.

155
00:11:58.064 --> 00:12:00.208
<i>hi, David. Are you ready?</i>

156
00:12:00.232 --> 00:12:01.474
Ready as I'll ever be.

157
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.028
<i>listen, the publisher called.</i>

158
00:12:03.052 --> 00:12:04.160
Uh-huh.

159
00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:05.472
<i>they wanna add another date.</i>

160
00:12:05.496 --> 00:12:08.889
They wanna add another
speaking engagement?


161
00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:10.218
<i>that's right.</i>

162
00:12:10.242 --> 00:12:12.735
Uh, yeah, let me
just check my diary.


163
00:12:12.812 --> 00:12:14.115
<i>it'll be for next week.</i>

164
00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:15.788
<i>They'll take care of everything.</i>

165
00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.917
<i>Can you make it?</i>

166
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:21.294
Yeah, yeah, I can make it work.

167
00:12:21.329 --> 00:12:23.023
<i>great, and Carl will
pick you up tonight.</i>


168
00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:25.131
Understood, Carl will
pick me up at 6:00 pm.


169
00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:26.932
<i>thank you.</i>

170
00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:29.493
Thank you for
organizing the tour.


171
00:12:29.571 --> 00:12:31.081
<i>have a great night tonight.</i>

172
00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:32.021
Okay.

173
00:12:32.098 --> 00:12:33.022
<i>bye.</i>

174
00:12:33.099 --> 00:12:35.099
Bye bye.

175
00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:49.763
I saw the worst of the worst.

176
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:54.786
And, uh... It changes
you in subtle ways.


177
00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:59.040
<i>Some not so subtle.</i>

178
00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:25.853
Hey, what's up?

179
00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:27.576
You are not gonna believe this.

180
00:13:27.653 --> 00:13:30.298
David Bryant is doing a
book signing this Friday.


181
00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:31.247
Who?

182
00:13:31.323 --> 00:13:32.381
David Bryant!

183
00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:34.083
The host of the
<i>unsolved files</i> podcast.


184
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.804
You recommended him to me?

185
00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:37.086
He's written a book.

186
00:13:37.163 --> 00:13:38.571
I don't know, could
be interesting.


187
00:13:38.647 --> 00:13:41.557
Hey, whatever gets you out
of that house, I'm down.


188
00:13:41.592 --> 00:13:42.892
Okay, I'll buy tickets.

189
00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:44.210
And I'll pick you up.

190
00:13:44.245 --> 00:13:45.753
It's a date.

191
00:13:51.928 --> 00:13:55.722
<i>with the podcast,
with these stories,</i>


192
00:13:55.757 --> 00:13:57.159
<i>I get to point the finger.</i>

193
00:13:57.183 --> 00:14:00.342
<i>I get to solve the crime.</i>

194
00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.807
<i>And there's always justice.</i>

195
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:05.339
so how do you
choose what's next?


196
00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:06.932
Well, it's pretty
simple, really.


197
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:10.436
I'm just... I'm looking
for a good story.


198
00:14:10.513 --> 00:14:14.623
With some sort of
vindication for the victims.


199
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.704
And it's usually about people
who never saw it coming.


200
00:15:09.497 --> 00:15:11.664
Hey, I'm walkin' out
the door right now.


201
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.801
<i>don't hate me.
I'm stuck at work.</i>


202
00:15:14.836 --> 00:15:15.851
Okay, no worries.

203
00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:16.903
If you can make it, great.

204
00:15:16.938 --> 00:15:18.854
And if not, you can owe me.

205
00:15:18.931 --> 00:15:20.080
<i>have fun.</i>

206
00:15:20.158 --> 00:15:21.390
Okay, thanks.

207
00:15:49.553 --> 00:15:50.353
Ashley!

208
00:15:50.388 --> 00:15:52.613
So glad to see that
your phone works.


209
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.023
Where's the car?

210
00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:55.949
It's good to hear from you too.

211
00:15:56.027 --> 00:15:59.178
I was worried about you when
I couldn't get a response.


212
00:15:59.213 --> 00:16:00.913
- Paul?
- What's wrong?


213
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.215
That's my car. I make
the payments on it.


214
00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.852
Yeah, but we're both on
the service agreement.


215
00:16:05.887 --> 00:16:07.531
I noticed the brakes were
sounding a little rough.


216
00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:10.857
The last time we rode in it, so
I had it towed to the dealer.


217
00:16:10.892 --> 00:16:12.852
Figured since you were off
in seclusion somewhere,


218
00:16:12.877 --> 00:16:14.910
You weren't gonna need it.

219
00:16:14.987 --> 00:16:15.661
Paul?

220
00:16:15.738 --> 00:16:18.239
I want the car back tomorrow.

221
00:16:18.316 --> 00:16:20.749
I'm already running
late. You screwed me!


222
00:16:20.826 --> 00:16:21.534
Where you goin'?

223
00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:22.785
Big date!

224
00:16:23.788 --> 00:16:25.154
What?

225
00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:36.883
Twenty minutes?

226
00:16:45.927 --> 00:16:48.519
He was so interesting
and just so...


227
00:16:50.648 --> 00:16:55.234
Well, yes, I mean, it's all
too common, unfortunately.


228
00:16:55.269 --> 00:17:00.272
I seem to have an endless
supply of cases to choose from.


229
00:17:00.425 --> 00:17:01.457
Wow.

230
00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:04.518
David, hi, I am
your biggest fan.


231
00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:09.916
I have listened to every
episode of <i>unsolved files.</i>


232
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:12.526
I find them so...

233
00:17:12.603 --> 00:17:14.356
Entertaining!

234
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.438
Thank you.

235
00:17:15.473 --> 00:17:18.858
It's not really
entertainment, though, is it?


236
00:17:18.893 --> 00:17:22.619
These are real people
with real traumas.


237
00:17:22.697 --> 00:17:28.300
And you have immense empathy
for the victims in your story.


238
00:17:28.377 --> 00:17:30.080
You see them.

239
00:17:30.104 --> 00:17:33.213
That kind of recognition
can help a lot of people.


240
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.791
Through some dark times.

241
00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:39.195
That's what I like about
the podcast, anyway.


242
00:17:39.305 --> 00:17:41.230
I like empathy.

243
00:17:41.307 --> 00:17:42.531
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

244
00:17:42.566 --> 00:17:45.634
No, no, no, no. That's right.

245
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:49.563
We should never forget that
these stories have real victims.


246
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.062
At the heart of every one.

247
00:17:54.086 --> 00:17:56.486
Thank you, everyone,
for coming out.


248
00:17:56.564 --> 00:17:57.732
Thank you.

249
00:17:57.756 --> 00:17:59.999
Thank you, David, so much.

250
00:18:02.186 --> 00:18:04.072
Um...

251
00:18:04.096 --> 00:18:05.154
David Bryant.

252
00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:06.166
I know.

253
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.099
Were you at the, the talk?

254
00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:10.309
Unfortunately I missed it.

255
00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:12.210
Um, my friend, she was
supposed to drive us,


256
00:18:12.363 --> 00:18:15.690
But she got caught up at
work, and then my car got...


257
00:18:16.984 --> 00:18:18.662
I just got here.

258
00:18:18.686 --> 00:18:20.836
But I brought a
copy of your book,


259
00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:23.030
And, um, I'd love
for you to sign it.


260
00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:27.434
I don't have a pen.

261
00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:29.161
I'm starving, you know?

262
00:18:29.196 --> 00:18:31.680
And there's a great place
right around the corner.


263
00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:34.608
And I'm sure they have pens.

264
00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:37.611
If you'd like to join me.

265
00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:41.340
And if that's too forward, I'd
be happy to just go in and...


266
00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:44.112
No, that would be great.

267
00:18:44.136 --> 00:18:47.013
I would love to.

268
00:18:49.383 --> 00:18:51.124
What? What is it?

269
00:18:51.202 --> 00:18:53.960
Nothing, you just...

270
00:18:54.038 --> 00:18:55.957
You remind me of someone.

271
00:19:12.706 --> 00:19:14.373
thank you so much.

272
00:19:14.408 --> 00:19:16.892
I don't know.

273
00:19:17.002 --> 00:19:19.712
I guess we rushed into things.

274
00:19:19.747 --> 00:19:22.398
In the beginning,
everything seemed perfect.


275
00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:24.825
It started with little things.

276
00:19:24.902 --> 00:19:28.512
Questioning me every time
I was going somewhere or...


277
00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:35.001
Then questions became
interrogations.


278
00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:36.929
He started tracking my phone.

279
00:19:37.005 --> 00:19:41.192
And asking me why I was
at the store at 2:00 pm.


280
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.157
It just got really, like,
controlling, constricting.


281
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.295
I didn't even really realize
it was happening, and so...


282
00:19:53.372 --> 00:19:54.747
It's a slow process,

283
00:19:54.857 --> 00:19:59.435
So you can't put up boundaries
to protect yourself.


284
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.470
You know, it's weird.

285
00:20:00.605 --> 00:20:03.024
I spend all my time
listening to these podcasts.


286
00:20:03.048 --> 00:20:04.957
And reading about women
who ignored the signs.


287
00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:08.029
Until it was really too late.

288
00:20:08.053 --> 00:20:11.931
It's common for men to make it
seem like it's the woman's fault.


289
00:20:11.966 --> 00:20:15.375
And... Society doesn't help.

290
00:20:15.486 --> 00:20:18.104
But these men are
in total control.


291
00:20:18.139 --> 00:20:23.308
They are the ones who we
should hold responsible.


292
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:26.645
So what made you leave?

293
00:20:26.722 --> 00:20:29.723
He got violent.

294
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.800
Well, I'm not trying
to frighten you,


295
00:20:31.835 --> 00:20:33.560
But once they become violent,

296
00:20:33.638 --> 00:20:38.893
That's usually no going
back to calm reasoning.


297
00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:41.977
He agreed to move out on a
temporary basis last month,


298
00:20:42.012 --> 00:20:44.830
But he's been begging
me to come back.


299
00:20:44.907 --> 00:20:48.158
did you get a
restraining order?


300
00:20:48.236 --> 00:20:51.303
It's often good to
establish a paper trail.


301
00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:52.671
With this kind of thing.

302
00:20:52.748 --> 00:20:56.744
I'm sorry, I'm not... I'm not
in law enforcement anymore.


303
00:20:56.768 --> 00:20:59.828
It's a hard habit to break.

304
00:20:59.863 --> 00:21:01.249
This is your life.

305
00:21:01.273 --> 00:21:02.917
No, it's okay.

306
00:21:02.941 --> 00:21:03.918
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:03.942 --> 00:21:05.587
I didn't mean to make
this a therapy session.


308
00:21:05.611 --> 00:21:07.686
And I'm not looking
for any advice,


309
00:21:07.763 --> 00:21:10.931
But I do appreciate
your insight.


310
00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:12.760
It's just nice to
talk to somebody.


311
00:21:12.784 --> 00:21:15.435
Who doesn't have a
dog in the fight.


312
00:21:15.513 --> 00:21:16.871
Anytime.

313
00:21:19.717 --> 00:21:21.517
So, what's next for the podcast?

314
00:21:21.552 --> 00:21:23.202
Any big plans for season two?

315
00:21:23.278 --> 00:21:26.338
Um, yeah, I got
one or two ideas,


316
00:21:26.373 --> 00:21:28.448
Nothing too solid.

317
00:21:28.526 --> 00:21:29.616
You can tell me.

318
00:21:29.694 --> 00:21:32.280
I'm not gonna go blabbing
on the internet, I swear.


319
00:21:32.304 --> 00:21:34.880
No, no, no, it's not
that, it's just...


320
00:21:34.957 --> 00:21:39.045
I, uh... I think I'm ready
to just take a break.


321
00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:41.220
From everything right now.

322
00:21:41.296 --> 00:21:43.124
I mean, the speaking
tour is keeping me busy,


323
00:21:43.148 --> 00:21:48.410
And my agent keeps
booking new dates.


324
00:21:48.487 --> 00:21:52.715
Maybe I'll find some
inspiration on the road.


325
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.900
Sniff out some good stories.

326
00:21:54.977 --> 00:21:55.917
Yeah.

327
00:21:55.994 --> 00:21:57.143
Sounds so fun.

328
00:21:57.221 --> 00:21:58.806
yeah, yeah, it is.

329
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.147
But... It's work, though.

330
00:22:01.225 --> 00:22:04.076
I would gladly trade
places with you.


331
00:22:04.152 --> 00:22:05.260
What do you do?

332
00:22:05.337 --> 00:22:06.212
Consulting.

333
00:22:06.321 --> 00:22:08.597
Yeah, I help businesses
reduce their energy costs.


334
00:22:08.674 --> 00:22:10.151
And be more eco friendly.

335
00:22:10.175 --> 00:22:11.433
- mm.
- Yeah, it's fun.


336
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.386
It's, uh, remote, so I get
to make my own schedule,


337
00:22:14.421 --> 00:22:17.497
And I really like that part.

338
00:22:17.575 --> 00:22:19.575
So you're untethered, then?

339
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:20.662
Hm?

340
00:22:20.686 --> 00:22:22.895
You said you felt stuck
before, but you're not.


341
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.763
You could do whatever you want.

342
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.509
You could go
anywhere, change jobs.


343
00:22:29.587 --> 00:22:32.596
There's nothing holding
you to the ground.


344
00:22:32.673 --> 00:22:34.256
Maybe I'll start a podcast.

345
00:22:34.366 --> 00:22:35.440
you should.

346
00:22:35.517 --> 00:22:37.276
yeah right.

347
00:22:37.352 --> 00:22:40.079
I'll help you.

348
00:22:40.114 --> 00:22:41.630
Really?

349
00:22:41.707 --> 00:22:42.606
hm.

350
00:22:42.683 --> 00:22:44.199
You can come by the studio.

351
00:22:44.276 --> 00:22:47.302
I want to show you
how I make an episode.


352
00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:49.104
Are you serious?

353
00:22:49.139 --> 00:22:50.472
Oh my god, I would love to.

354
00:22:53.477 --> 00:22:54.443
That was lovely.

355
00:22:54.478 --> 00:22:55.201
Thank you.

356
00:22:55.279 --> 00:22:57.946
I really needed a night out.

357
00:22:57.981 --> 00:22:59.782
My pleasure.

358
00:22:59.817 --> 00:23:03.302
Aren't you, uh,
forgetting something?


359
00:23:03.378 --> 00:23:04.970
What's that?

360
00:23:05.047 --> 00:23:07.815
Oh, you had a pen
the whole time!


361
00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:19.084
I'd, uh, love to do this again.

362
00:23:19.161 --> 00:23:21.553
Soon.

363
00:23:21.588 --> 00:23:23.229
Well, if you're
gonna give me a peek.


364
00:23:23.307 --> 00:23:24.506
Behind the podcast curtain,

365
00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:28.735
We'll have to see each other
fairly often, won't we?


366
00:23:28.813 --> 00:23:30.495
I'd like that.

367
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.511
My rideshare's here.

368
00:23:40.808 --> 00:23:42.099
Bye.

369
00:25:11.523 --> 00:25:12.564
Hey.

370
00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:15.067
You are not gonna believe this.

371
00:26:28.375 --> 00:26:32.978
This is a story... Of revenge.

372
00:26:55.503 --> 00:26:58.253
Hey, beautiful! 
How's it going?

373
00:27:30.387 --> 00:27:31.477
Why, hello.

374
00:27:31.555 --> 00:27:34.890
<i>Is this celebrated podcaster
and author David Bryant?</i>


375
00:27:34.925 --> 00:27:35.757
It is.

376
00:27:35.834 --> 00:27:37.175
And what do I owe the pleasure?

377
00:27:37.252 --> 00:27:40.314
<i>well, I was thinking about
our chat the other night,</i>


378
00:27:40.338 --> 00:27:42.488
And I was wondering if
you'd like to come by.


379
00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:44.675
And see the studio sometime.

380
00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:48.920
Oh my god, I would love to.

381
00:27:48.997 --> 00:27:50.255
How about now?

382
00:27:51.508 --> 00:27:52.824
What?

383
00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:54.100
<i>are you serious?</i>

384
00:27:54.178 --> 00:27:56.330
Almost always.

385
00:27:56.354 --> 00:27:58.914
Well, I was thinking of taking
the rest of the afternoon off.


386
00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:00.006
Where are ya now?

387
00:28:00.084 --> 00:28:01.335
Downtown.

388
00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:03.101
Oh! I'm, uh, in the area.

389
00:28:03.178 --> 00:28:05.270
I could come pick you up.

390
00:28:05.347 --> 00:28:07.573
Okay. Yeah, that would be great.

391
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.796
This is Ashley huff,
amateur sleuth,


392
00:28:14.873 --> 00:28:17.099
Very amateur.

393
00:28:17.134 --> 00:28:22.254
Um, not quite sure what to say?

394
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:25.799
This is a lot harder
than it looks.


395
00:28:28.278 --> 00:28:30.364
Okay.

396
00:28:35.152 --> 00:28:37.961
Some families seem
to have it all.


397
00:28:38.038 --> 00:28:40.355
The house, the cars,

398
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:45.493
The exotic vacations,
the country clubs.


399
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.708
But money and things
aren't enough for people.


400
00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:51.499
Some seek much more.

401
00:28:51.576 --> 00:28:52.784
Power.

402
00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:54.335
Influence.

403
00:28:54.412 --> 00:28:56.374
Respect.

404
00:28:56.398 --> 00:28:59.157
And the family that
we're looking at tonight.


405
00:28:59.234 --> 00:29:00.809
Had everything.

406
00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:06.347
But under the shiny veneer
of their family crest,


407
00:29:06.424 --> 00:29:08.233
A darkness festered.

408
00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:09.434
yes.

409
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:12.763
A legal dynasty
that had it all...


410
00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:15.641
Power, control.

411
00:29:15.676 --> 00:29:19.080
But they would have to
do whatever it takes.


412
00:29:19.104 --> 00:29:21.337
To maintain it.

413
00:29:21.415 --> 00:29:24.023
Murder, mayhem, and...

414
00:29:24.101 --> 00:29:24.942
The murdaughs.

415
00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:27.519
yeah.

416
00:29:27.595 --> 00:29:29.321
That was good.

417
00:29:29.356 --> 00:29:31.356
You have a knack.

418
00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:32.265
Please delete that.

419
00:29:32.342 --> 00:29:35.210
No! That was awesome.

420
00:29:36.847 --> 00:29:38.863
So do you do all
your work in here?


421
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.615
Uh, yeah, yeah.

422
00:29:40.692 --> 00:29:45.272
Research, writing,
recording, soup to nuts.


423
00:29:45.296 --> 00:29:48.607
Yeah, it's not the fbi
field office, but...


424
00:29:48.642 --> 00:29:51.278
This is where I'd rather be.

425
00:29:51.302 --> 00:29:52.844
Do you ever miss it?

426
00:29:52.879 --> 00:29:54.287
Sometimes.

427
00:29:54.364 --> 00:29:59.184
The thrill of
hunting and catching.


428
00:29:59.219 --> 00:30:02.389
Actually evil people.

429
00:30:02.413 --> 00:30:05.626
But, uh...

430
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.226
It consumed me.

431
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:11.880
That's why I play
pretend, so I can...


432
00:30:11.915 --> 00:30:15.719
I can satisfy that
compulsion without...


433
00:30:15.743 --> 00:30:19.154
Being consumed.

434
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.957
Where do you think that
compulsion comes from?


435
00:30:21.992 --> 00:30:25.744
Were you, like, a crusader
in kindergarten for justice.


436
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.339
And made sure they
shared their crayons?


437
00:30:33.469 --> 00:30:36.471
I didn't mean to
make light of it.


438
00:30:59.129 --> 00:31:00.662
Maddie fulton.

439
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.582
We went to school together.

440
00:31:06.603 --> 00:31:08.336
What happened to her?

441
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:10.672
Mm...

442
00:31:12.117 --> 00:31:13.675
We were classmates.

443
00:31:15.554 --> 00:31:16.720
You don't have to tell me.

444
00:31:16.797 --> 00:31:18.399
No, no, no, I...

445
00:31:18.423 --> 00:31:20.784
Yeah, I'm sorry.

446
00:31:20.808 --> 00:31:21.816
Yeah, you asked,

447
00:31:21.893 --> 00:31:23.785
And I'm finally ready
to talk about her.


448
00:31:24.212 --> 00:31:28.774
Uh, we went out, and
um, not for long.


449
00:31:28.809 --> 00:31:30.711
High school sweethearts.

450
00:31:30.735 --> 00:31:32.694
Not too serious, though.

451
00:31:34.247 --> 00:31:36.782
After graduation, I
went off to school.


452
00:31:36.817 --> 00:31:38.316
And she stayed in town.

453
00:31:38.393 --> 00:31:42.120
I remember I came back for
summer break, and, um...


454
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.825
Truth is, I couldn't
stop thinking about her,


455
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:51.398
So, I, I reached out
just to see if maybe.


456
00:31:51.422 --> 00:31:53.340
She felt the same way.

457
00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:58.053
Anyway, she was
dating someone else,


458
00:31:58.088 --> 00:32:00.931
Uh, James houser.

459
00:32:01.007 --> 00:32:03.992
Was a little bit older.

460
00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:05.768
Was from a rich family.

461
00:32:06.104 --> 00:32:08.313
He had a lot of what I didn't.

462
00:32:09.266 --> 00:32:11.502
So when it was clear
that she was into him,


463
00:32:11.526 --> 00:32:13.763
I went back to school.

464
00:32:13.787 --> 00:32:16.674
And one day I got
this call from her.


465
00:32:16.698 --> 00:32:18.373
She was crying.

466
00:32:18.449 --> 00:32:23.511
He had hit her
during an argument.


467
00:32:23.546 --> 00:32:26.606
I was so furious.

468
00:32:26.683 --> 00:32:28.716
And I was also a
thousand miles away.


469
00:32:28.793 --> 00:32:30.437
So I told her she should leave.

470
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:34.706
And just wait for
me to come home.


471
00:32:34.782 --> 00:32:37.050
But that wasn't what
she wanted to hear.


472
00:32:39.045 --> 00:32:42.197
Then one day she...

473
00:32:42.232 --> 00:32:44.957
Told me that she
had forgiven him.


474
00:32:45.035 --> 00:32:48.539
That it had all been
kind of an exaggeration.


475
00:32:48.563 --> 00:32:50.230
And it was okay and...

476
00:32:53.827 --> 00:32:55.560
That while she
appreciated my concern,


477
00:32:55.637 --> 00:32:59.800
She didn't feel comfortable
or think it was appropriate.


478
00:32:59.824 --> 00:33:02.803
For us to keep in touch.

479
00:33:02.827 --> 00:33:04.077
Oh.

480
00:33:05.289 --> 00:33:09.916
then I got the call that
every loved one dreads.


481
00:33:12.562 --> 00:33:17.348
She had been murdered,

482
00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:21.077
Beaten, and...

483
00:33:21.154 --> 00:33:24.239
Left in a field near...

484
00:33:24.274 --> 00:33:25.515
Her house.

485
00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:29.561
I know he did it.

486
00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:35.233
But the police didn't
have anything on him.


487
00:33:35.943 --> 00:33:38.945
His daddy bought him
these really good lawyers.


488
00:33:46.046 --> 00:33:50.040
I wanted to do something,
and I just, I couldn't.


489
00:33:52.285 --> 00:33:57.214
I was just helpless to help her.

490
00:33:58.366 --> 00:34:03.035
So after school, I swore
that I was gonna...


491
00:34:03.113 --> 00:34:07.891
Either nail him or
kill him myself.


492
00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.371
Um...

493
00:34:10.395 --> 00:34:12.520
He left the country
and went to England.


494
00:34:13.898 --> 00:34:16.316
He died of cancer
a few years ago.


495
00:34:18.603 --> 00:34:22.132
Oh David, I'm sorry.

496
00:34:22.156 --> 00:34:23.698
That's in the past now.

497
00:34:26.245 --> 00:34:28.787
He never had to answer
for what he did to her.


498
00:34:36.754 --> 00:34:38.338
He got away with it.

499
00:34:42.836 --> 00:34:44.469
You never did an
episode about it.


500
00:34:44.504 --> 00:34:49.007
No, I thought about doing
one after he, uh, died,


501
00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:51.518
Just to sort of put
it behind me, but...


502
00:35:00.111 --> 00:35:01.403
I understand.

503
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.956
You know, David,
there was nothing.


504
00:35:05.032 --> 00:35:08.793
- That you could've done.
- I know.


505
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.030
I've beaten myself
up a lot for it.


506
00:35:12.766 --> 00:35:18.019
And eventually I,
I forgave myself.


507
00:35:18.054 --> 00:35:21.039
I... thank you for saying that.

508
00:35:21.115 --> 00:35:25.476
This is why you can't be
too careful about your ex.


509
00:35:25.553 --> 00:35:31.382
You can never underestimate it,

510
00:35:31.459 --> 00:35:36.980
Never brush things off again.

511
00:35:39.409 --> 00:35:42.360
You understand?

512
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.529
I do.

513
00:35:47.534 --> 00:35:49.951
I should take you home.

514
00:36:00.505 --> 00:36:03.317
Thank you for the ride.

515
00:36:03.341 --> 00:36:06.417
I'm sorry that I
unloaded all that.


516
00:36:06.494 --> 00:36:12.106
I haven't shared that
with anyone in...


517
00:36:12.183 --> 00:36:14.392
- Many years.
- No, it's, it's okay.


518
00:36:14.427 --> 00:36:16.777
I'm glad you told me.

519
00:36:16.854 --> 00:36:20.339
I guess part of me
just hopes that.


520
00:36:20.417 --> 00:36:24.285
These stories that I
tell can help others.


521
00:36:24.362 --> 00:36:26.237
Avoid the same fate.

522
00:36:30.518 --> 00:36:33.703
Especially the people
that, that I care about.


523
00:39:17.293 --> 00:39:18.952
David?

524
00:39:34.277 --> 00:39:36.135
David?

525
00:39:58.134 --> 00:39:59.284
Hey.

526
00:39:59.319 --> 00:40:01.119
Sorry, I didn't wanna wake you.

527
00:40:01.228 --> 00:40:03.223
Mm, thanks.

528
00:40:03.247 --> 00:40:04.914
Back to bed.

529
00:40:17.019 --> 00:40:20.921
Well, I had a really,
really nice night.


530
00:40:20.956 --> 00:40:21.789
Yeah.

531
00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:24.859
Best that I've had
in a long time.


532
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:28.646
I'm just glad I
didn't scare you away.


533
00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:31.515
No, not even a little.

534
00:40:31.592 --> 00:40:33.170
Good.

535
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.996
What?

536
00:40:46.215 --> 00:40:49.383
I haven't felt
like this for a...


537
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.271
For a long time.

538
00:40:51.295 --> 00:40:54.464
Neither have I.

539
00:41:01.288 --> 00:41:02.347
Okay.

540
00:41:03.224 --> 00:41:05.483
I'll call you.

541
00:41:05.518 --> 00:41:06.893
You better.

542
00:41:16.396 --> 00:41:19.989
Ashley can't remember the
last time she felt happy.


543
00:41:21.167 --> 00:41:25.547
Though she appears free...

544
00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:27.330
She is a prisoner.

545
00:41:28.149 --> 00:41:33.480
And Paul, the man she
thought she loved,


546
00:41:33.504 --> 00:41:34.962
Is her warden.

547
00:41:43.272 --> 00:41:47.758
Beautiful, intelligent,
full of life,


548
00:41:47.835 --> 00:41:50.094
All she knows is torment...

549
00:41:50.129 --> 00:41:55.958
A torment that has
become so... Familiar,


550
00:41:56.035 --> 00:41:59.105
That she doesn't
even recognize it.


551
00:41:59.129 --> 00:42:03.290
<i>Constant surveillance,
endless rules.</i>


552
00:42:03.325 --> 00:42:05.209
<i>She can no longer breathe,</i>

553
00:42:05.244 --> 00:42:09.414
<i>But she has learned
to live without air.</i>


554
00:42:09.449 --> 00:42:12.250
<i>She is trapped.</i>

555
00:42:12.285 --> 00:42:14.602
<i>"he's a coward," she
told her friends.</i>


556
00:42:14.637 --> 00:42:17.922
<i>"he won't try anything now."</i>

557
00:42:17.957 --> 00:42:20.775
<i>And the next time she got home,</i>

558
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:26.055
<i>She would learn that she
wasn't safe anywhere.</i>


559
00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:30.217
<i>She had humiliated him,</i>

560
00:42:30.252 --> 00:42:33.996
<i>But her punishment
was yet to come.</i>


561
00:42:34.073 --> 00:42:38.634
<i>Today was just about
sending a message.</i>


562
00:42:46.243 --> 00:42:48.555
<i>he's just, he's different.</i>

563
00:42:48.579 --> 00:42:52.475
He's sensitive and
kind, but not...


564
00:42:52.499 --> 00:42:55.000
Not the kind of guy
that has your car towed.


565
00:42:55.111 --> 00:42:58.337
No, that was a pain to get back.

566
00:42:58.414 --> 00:43:02.216
- No, he's...
- he's hot, intelligent.


567
00:43:02.251 --> 00:43:04.902
Fights crime, is
famous. I get it.


568
00:43:04.937 --> 00:43:06.656
You've landed your
perfect rebound guy.


569
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.990
No, he's not a rebound guy.

570
00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:12.084
He's... More than that.

571
00:43:12.161 --> 00:43:14.345
Are you falling for him?

572
00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:18.084
No, I'm not falling for him.

573
00:43:18.108 --> 00:43:20.425
Just be careful, okay?

574
00:43:20.503 --> 00:43:23.423
<i>In messy situations like
the one that you're in,</i>


575
00:43:23.447 --> 00:43:25.022
<i>It's easy to latch on.</i>

576
00:43:25.099 --> 00:43:27.266
Because something's new and fun.

577
00:43:29.545 --> 00:43:30.878
I know the difference.

578
00:43:30.955 --> 00:43:33.516
This is not that.

579
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.033
Look, Paul and I
were so by the book.


580
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.453
<i>Okay, dating, wedding,
house in the suburbs.</i>


581
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.239
From the outside, it looked
like a perfect marriage,


582
00:43:42.317 --> 00:43:46.310
But... You know how
that turned out.


583
00:43:46.387 --> 00:43:49.958
But with David, I have no
idea where this is going.


584
00:43:49.982 --> 00:43:53.184
I'm embracing the
excitement and the unknown.


585
00:43:53.294 --> 00:43:57.655
Don't be upset, but you tend
to get excited about things.


586
00:43:57.731 --> 00:44:00.858
And jump in with both
feet, and it's sweet.


587
00:44:00.893 --> 00:44:04.578
Your podcast, your
painting last year,


588
00:44:04.655 --> 00:44:08.382
Your knitting that one winter.

589
00:44:08.417 --> 00:44:09.545
I mean, you get where I'm going.

590
00:44:09.569 --> 00:44:10.868
Yes.

591
00:44:10.903 --> 00:44:13.478
He's not my latest
project, okay?


592
00:44:13.556 --> 00:44:16.407
I'm happy and that's enough.

593
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:52.994
Whoa!

594
00:44:53.796 --> 00:44:56.447
This is incredible.

595
00:44:56.523 --> 00:44:58.394
How long have you lived here?

596
00:44:58.418 --> 00:45:01.785
Uh, several years now.

597
00:45:01.862 --> 00:45:05.256
Just, uh... Wait until
you see the bedroom.


598
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.100
<i>so when are you
seeing him again?</i>


599
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.303
- Hi!
- Hey there.


600
00:45:25.327 --> 00:45:27.820
Did I catch you at a bad time?

601
00:45:29.756 --> 00:45:32.724
I'm just finishing up a
project. Just give me a second.


602
00:45:32.802 --> 00:45:34.220
<i>I can give you a call back.</i>

603
00:45:34.244 --> 00:45:38.313
Uh, no. There. 
That's better.

604
00:45:38.391 --> 00:45:42.493
I was just wondering when
I'm gonna see you again.


605
00:45:42.569 --> 00:45:44.311
What about now?

606
00:45:44.346 --> 00:45:45.824
Oh, I'm, I'm out
with lily right now,


607
00:45:45.848 --> 00:45:48.682
But, um, I was thinking
about cooking you dinner.


608
00:45:48.759 --> 00:45:49.984
<i>a home-cooked meal,</i>

609
00:45:50.019 --> 00:45:51.652
How can I say no?

610
00:45:51.762 --> 00:45:52.911
<i>a date.</i>

611
00:45:52.989 --> 00:45:54.764
<i>How about 8:00 pm?</i>

612
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.248
Sounds perfect.

613
00:45:56.325 --> 00:45:58.225
Okay, see you then.

614
00:47:13.102 --> 00:47:15.052
Paul...

615
00:47:48.287 --> 00:47:51.149
I told you to stay
away from the house.


616
00:47:51.173 --> 00:47:51.858
I have.

617
00:47:51.882 --> 00:47:52.951
I know you were here, Paul.

618
00:47:52.975 --> 00:47:53.941
I found your sunglasses.

619
00:47:53.976 --> 00:47:55.420
I have, like, 20
pairs of sunglasses.


620
00:47:55.444 --> 00:47:56.772
What the hell are
you talking about?


621
00:47:56.796 --> 00:47:58.290
Of course some of
them would be there.


622
00:47:58.314 --> 00:48:00.016
<i>well, I didn't put them
in the bedroom, Paul.</i>


623
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.932
Look, I've given
you a lot of leeway,


624
00:48:01.967 --> 00:48:03.762
And I don't wanna have to
get the police involved,


625
00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:05.781
But I'm gonna have to if
you keep pulling this crap.


626
00:48:05.805 --> 00:48:06.805
The police?

627
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.290
Because you think I'm
coming to my own house?


628
00:48:09.325 --> 00:48:12.234
I want you to stay away from me.

629
00:48:12.311 --> 00:48:13.711
You've lost it, ash.

630
00:48:13.746 --> 00:48:15.131
I don't know what
you think happened,


631
00:48:15.155 --> 00:48:16.308
What you're making
up in your head,


632
00:48:16.332 --> 00:48:17.550
What you're telling our friends?

633
00:48:17.574 --> 00:48:19.633
<i>I didn't make anything up.</i>

634
00:48:19.668 --> 00:48:21.971
<i>Just... Leave me alone.</i>

635
00:48:21.995 --> 00:48:23.821
<i>gladly.</i>

636
00:48:36.335 --> 00:48:38.018
Hello?

637
00:48:38.095 --> 00:48:39.970
Yes, I would like to
file a restraining order.


638
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.689
I have to turn it
in with the court.


639
00:48:42.766 --> 00:48:45.161
He said that it may
take a few weeks.


640
00:48:45.185 --> 00:48:46.835
That's normal.

641
00:48:46.913 --> 00:48:50.514
Just starting the process
is an immense help.


642
00:48:50.591 --> 00:48:53.367
Like I said,
documentation, paper trail,


643
00:48:53.443 --> 00:48:58.072
It's the only way to get the
legal system to work for ya.


644
00:49:00.359 --> 00:49:02.109
At least now he'll
stay away from me.


645
00:49:02.186 --> 00:49:06.363
You can't rely just
on a piece of paper.


646
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.083
He's not gonna do
anything. He's a coward.


647
00:49:09.118 --> 00:49:13.278
Sometimes the most...

648
00:49:13.356 --> 00:49:15.840
Frightened, tiny men.

649
00:49:15.875 --> 00:49:19.951
Are the most dangerous.

650
00:49:20.029 --> 00:49:23.264
And you cannot stop
being vigilant.


651
00:49:26.293 --> 00:49:28.627
So much for a
home-cooked meal, right?


652
00:49:28.704 --> 00:49:30.962
Leave it to Paul
to ruin our night.


653
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.691
You can owe me.

654
00:49:33.726 --> 00:49:35.192
Yeah.

655
00:49:36.303 --> 00:49:39.137
You seem exhausted.

656
00:49:39.215 --> 00:49:43.250
Yeah, it's been a long day.

657
00:49:43.327 --> 00:49:44.621
I don't think I could
stay in the house.


658
00:49:44.645 --> 00:49:48.458
And not wonder if he
is gonna come back.


659
00:49:48.482 --> 00:49:50.982
Wanna stay here?
No expectations.


660
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.826
You can have the bedroom.
I got work to do.


661
00:49:52.903 --> 00:49:57.080
I can crash in
the, the guestroom.


662
00:49:57.157 --> 00:49:59.133
You're safe here.

663
00:50:03.923 --> 00:50:05.222
Yeah.

664
00:50:05.257 --> 00:50:07.224
Yeah, okay.

665
00:50:38.357 --> 00:50:39.623
Thanks.

666
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.634
And, uh, this.

667
00:50:43.979 --> 00:50:45.779
What's this?

668
00:50:45.814 --> 00:50:47.514
that'll help you sleep.

669
00:50:48.834 --> 00:50:51.543
I'm gonna be in the studio
getting some work done.


670
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.104
If you need anything,
you just let me know.


671
00:50:54.139 --> 00:50:56.868
But get some rest.

672
00:50:56.892 --> 00:50:58.984
I will. Thank you.

673
00:51:05.734 --> 00:51:08.935
With the disturbance
at the house,


674
00:51:09.013 --> 00:51:12.814
The warning signs were mounting.

675
00:51:12.892 --> 00:51:15.984
But she was defiant.

676
00:51:16.062 --> 00:51:19.229
"he's a coward," she
told her friends.


677
00:51:19.264 --> 00:51:21.966
"he wouldn't try anything now."

678
00:51:22.001 --> 00:51:27.671
<i>Whether she believed that
or not was hard to tell.</i>


679
00:51:27.748 --> 00:51:30.607
<i>But what was for sure is that.</i>

680
00:51:30.684 --> 00:51:34.912
<i>The threat of the restraining
order wouldn't deter him.</i>


681
00:51:34.947 --> 00:51:38.115
<i>And the next time she got home,</i>

682
00:51:38.191 --> 00:51:43.854
<i>She would find she wasn't
safe there anymore.</i>


683
00:52:14.294 --> 00:52:17.721
Paul slipped inside.

684
00:52:17.798 --> 00:52:20.374
He crossed this threshold
thousands of times,


685
00:52:20.484 --> 00:52:24.227
And now he felt like a thief,

686
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.633
Slipping in undetected,

687
00:52:27.657 --> 00:52:32.536
His heart rate rising with
the fear of being caught.


688
00:52:36.316 --> 00:52:39.092
He walked into the kitchen...

689
00:52:39.169 --> 00:52:42.629
His kitchen, he told himself.

690
00:52:44.733 --> 00:52:47.551
He'd spent so much time in here.

691
00:52:47.586 --> 00:52:51.513
Laughing, crying, fighting.

692
00:52:52.408 --> 00:52:55.275
It seemed so empty now,

693
00:52:55.352 --> 00:52:59.165
Knowing that he
wasn't wanted here.


694
00:52:59.189 --> 00:53:02.816
It was almost unbearable.

695
00:53:15.614 --> 00:53:19.852
He thought of all the things
that he wanted to do to her.


696
00:53:19.876 --> 00:53:22.920
He loved her with
his entire being,


697
00:53:22.955 --> 00:53:27.049
But he knew he had to punish
her for her rejection.


698
00:53:27.701 --> 00:53:28.592
She hadn't just hurt him.

699
00:53:28.627 --> 00:53:32.304
She had humiliated him.

700
00:53:33.432 --> 00:53:35.849
That punishment was
yet to come, though.


701
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:40.312
Today was just about.

702
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.109
Sending a message.

703
00:53:48.797 --> 00:53:51.532
Hi... Sleepy.

704
00:53:56.079 --> 00:53:57.830
Hi.

705
00:54:02.235 --> 00:54:03.729
Oh my god.

706
00:54:03.753 --> 00:54:05.069
I should get going.

707
00:54:05.147 --> 00:54:06.663
Are you sure?

708
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.148
Yeah, I'm fine.

709
00:54:08.183 --> 00:54:11.835
Just not used to
sleeping pills, I guess.


710
00:54:11.912 --> 00:54:15.575
Mm, you've been through a lot,

711
00:54:15.599 --> 00:54:17.975
And I think you should stay.

712
00:54:18.827 --> 00:54:22.312
No, no, no, that's sweet, but...

713
00:54:22.347 --> 00:54:24.923
I have a lot of work that
I've been putting off.


714
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.335
Okay, but it's not safe for
you to stay there anymore.


715
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:30.070
I'm not saying you
have to stay here,


716
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.032
But maybe... Do you
have a friend to call?


717
00:54:34.677 --> 00:54:36.994
Okay, yeah, I'll call lily.

718
00:54:37.663 --> 00:54:40.099
I should go with you.

719
00:54:40.123 --> 00:54:41.181
No, it's okay.

720
00:54:41.216 --> 00:54:43.183
I can handle it myself.

721
00:54:43.218 --> 00:54:44.168
Of course.

722
00:54:44.203 --> 00:54:50.123
Just... Be on the alert, okay?

723
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.612
Promise me.

724
00:54:52.636 --> 00:54:54.344
Okay, I will.

725
00:54:58.642 --> 00:55:02.830
Hey, Susan, I'm so sorry
for the late reply.


726
00:55:02.854 --> 00:55:04.365
Yeah, no, I can talk
to one of our vendors.


727
00:55:04.389 --> 00:55:08.775
About putting a charging
station in the garage.


728
00:55:11.864 --> 00:55:13.163
Yes.

729
00:55:13.239 --> 00:55:15.974
No, it's not gonna be a problem.

730
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:17.034
Yeah, we can...

731
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:21.254
Uh, Susan, I'm sorry, can
I give you a call back?


732
00:55:21.331 --> 00:55:22.789
Yeah, no, I will. Thanks.

733
00:55:26.178 --> 00:55:27.544
Paul?

734
00:55:38.106 --> 00:55:39.598
Paul?

735
00:56:22.959 --> 00:56:23.895
when's the last time.

736
00:56:23.919 --> 00:56:26.069
You saw your husband in person?

737
00:56:26.104 --> 00:56:27.253
Ma'am?

738
00:56:27.331 --> 00:56:29.139
Oh, um, last week.

739
00:56:29.215 --> 00:56:31.308
And where did this
meeting occur?


740
00:56:31.384 --> 00:56:32.384
Here.

741
00:56:32.461 --> 00:56:34.828
He tried to get
inside to talk to me.


742
00:56:34.904 --> 00:56:37.889
I was here with my friend.
Her name is lily rollins.


743
00:56:37.966 --> 00:56:39.552
He had tried calling
a couple times,


744
00:56:39.576 --> 00:56:42.619
But I guess he got fed up
and decided to come over.


745
00:56:42.654 --> 00:56:46.308
Did he try to force his way in?

746
00:56:46.332 --> 00:56:47.993
He was trying to get
back together with me,


747
00:56:48.017 --> 00:56:49.492
But I turned him down.

748
00:56:49.569 --> 00:56:51.689
Did he threaten you in any way?

749
00:56:51.713 --> 00:56:56.258
No, he was playing
nice... for him, anyway.


750
00:56:57.336 --> 00:56:58.696
Are you all right?

751
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.578
Yeah.

752
00:57:00.656 --> 00:57:01.838
This is lily.

753
00:57:01.915 --> 00:57:03.356
What are y'all still doing here?

754
00:57:03.433 --> 00:57:04.577
Go get him.

755
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:06.520
I'll be glad to take a statement
from you as well, ma'am.


756
00:57:06.544 --> 00:57:07.989
Just let me finish up
with ms. Huff here.


757
00:57:08.013 --> 00:57:10.814
It's okay, lil, I'm
telling them everything.


758
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:13.859
Does anybody else have a key to
your home besides your husband?


759
00:57:15.687 --> 00:57:18.096
Okay, that narrows thing down.

760
00:57:18.173 --> 00:57:20.115
But this feels different.

761
00:57:22.627 --> 00:57:25.473
Like, he's always
been controlling.


762
00:57:25.497 --> 00:57:28.551
But what's the point
of terrorizing me?


763
00:57:28.575 --> 00:57:30.412
If he thinks this is gonna
get us back together,


764
00:57:30.436 --> 00:57:33.230
He's completely delusional.

765
00:57:33.254 --> 00:57:38.191
Well, he was never the
sharpest crayon in the box.


766
00:57:38.226 --> 00:57:39.226
Yeah.

767
00:57:39.302 --> 00:57:41.238
If anything, this is your sign.

768
00:57:41.262 --> 00:57:45.284
That you need to get
rid of him for good.


769
00:57:45.308 --> 00:57:47.100
Yeah, I know.

770
00:57:53.383 --> 00:57:54.608
That's the police.

771
00:57:55.143 --> 00:57:57.027
- Hello?
<i>- ms. Huff?</i>


772
00:57:57.062 --> 00:57:58.336
Yes, this is she.

773
00:57:58.413 --> 00:58:00.380
<i>we spoke to Paul.
He has an alibi.</i>


774
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.467
What?

775
00:58:01.491 --> 00:58:02.785
<i>and a woman confirmed it.</i>

776
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:05.062
No, that's not possible.
He was here, I know it.


777
00:58:05.086 --> 00:58:06.305
<i>sorry, ma'am, but...</i>

778
00:58:06.329 --> 00:58:07.490
so you're not
gonna do anything?


779
00:58:07.514 --> 00:58:09.723
<i>there's nothing we can do.</i>

780
00:58:09.758 --> 00:58:11.408
No, I understand.

781
00:58:11.484 --> 00:58:12.751
Okay, thanks.

782
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:14.944
Bad news?

783
00:58:15.022 --> 00:58:16.315
they said he has an alibi.

784
00:58:16.339 --> 00:58:18.317
And a witness to back it up.

785
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:19.399
Who?

786
00:58:19.434 --> 00:58:20.884
Some woman.

787
00:58:20.919 --> 00:58:22.068
Oh.

788
00:58:22.103 --> 00:58:24.148
so not only is he tormenting
me in my own home,


789
00:58:24.172 --> 00:58:25.764
But he's seeing other women too.

790
00:58:29.143 --> 00:58:30.535
okay, okay, okay, okay.

791
00:58:30.612 --> 00:58:32.579
Just breathe. It's
gonna be okay.


792
00:58:32.614 --> 00:58:35.532
- It's gonna be okay...
- none of this is okay, lily!


793
00:58:35.608 --> 00:58:38.170
Okay, uh, I'm gonna
clean this up.


794
00:58:38.194 --> 00:58:40.195
Just breathe.

795
00:58:54.953 --> 00:58:56.420
Ash?

796
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:03.218
- What is that?
- Shh.


797
00:59:49.916 --> 00:59:51.975
It has to have been Paul.

798
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:53.894
No, paul's not smart
enough to bug me.


799
00:59:53.929 --> 00:59:56.313
And what would be
the point, anyway?


800
00:59:56.348 --> 00:59:58.164
David?

801
00:59:58.199 --> 01:00:02.443
When you were together
the other night,


802
01:00:02.521 --> 01:00:04.654
Were you with him
the entire time?


803
01:00:04.689 --> 01:00:06.167
Well, there was a
moment when I woke up.


804
01:00:06.191 --> 01:00:08.992
And he wasn't in bed,
but it's not possible.


805
01:00:09.102 --> 01:00:11.861
And you were with
him last night.


806
01:00:11.938 --> 01:00:13.830
The whole night?

807
01:00:13.865 --> 01:00:15.832
No.

808
01:00:15.867 --> 01:00:20.295
He was working while I slept.

809
01:00:21.023 --> 01:00:23.275
What if he's behind all of this?

810
01:00:23.299 --> 01:00:24.508
The knife and the break-ins?

811
01:00:24.543 --> 01:00:27.560
- But why would he?
- I don't know.


812
01:00:27.637 --> 01:00:28.637
I don't know, but...

813
01:00:28.697 --> 01:00:29.841
Every time that
something has happened,


814
01:00:29.865 --> 01:00:31.214
I've gone to him for help.

815
01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:34.734
Using your fear of Paul...

816
01:00:34.811 --> 01:00:37.940
As manipulation to get
you falling for him?


817
01:00:37.964 --> 01:00:39.297
Yeah. And who do I know.

818
01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:41.741
That has access to lots
of recording equipment?


819
01:00:41.818 --> 01:00:44.361
Paul could've
ordered them online.


820
01:00:44.396 --> 01:00:45.946
But you're right.

821
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:48.915
I'm not gonna do it again, lily.

822
01:00:48.992 --> 01:00:51.067
- Do what?
- Ignore the signs.


823
01:00:51.144 --> 01:00:54.454
My gut is telling me that
something else is going on here.


824
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.037
Hey, David.

825
01:01:11.114 --> 01:01:13.350
Are you okay?

826
01:01:13.374 --> 01:01:14.182
I'm fine.

827
01:01:14.259 --> 01:01:15.829
I just spent the whole
day with the police.


828
01:01:15.853 --> 01:01:19.164
Trying to convince
them it was Paul again.


829
01:01:19.188 --> 01:01:21.417
Did they arrest him yet?

830
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:23.700
No, he has an alibi.

831
01:01:23.776 --> 01:01:26.338
Unbelievable.

832
01:01:26.362 --> 01:01:29.180
Well, remember what
we talked about.


833
01:01:29.257 --> 01:01:32.759
Stay vigilant. Right.

834
01:01:32.794 --> 01:01:35.264
- Do you want me to come over?
- No.


835
01:01:35.288 --> 01:01:38.098
Um, truth is, I don't really
feel safe here anymore.


836
01:01:38.133 --> 01:01:41.134
Paul's kinda taken
that away from me.


837
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:42.777
You can come here.

838
01:01:42.854 --> 01:01:45.613
Stay as long as you like.

839
01:01:45.691 --> 01:01:48.425
I'll keep you safe.

840
01:01:51.046 --> 01:01:52.879
Ashley?

841
01:01:52.914 --> 01:01:54.063
Okay.

842
01:01:54.098 --> 01:01:55.075
I'll see you soon.

843
01:01:55.099 --> 01:01:56.683
I'll be waiting.

844
01:02:00.146 --> 01:02:02.314
What are you gonna do?

845
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.909
I guess I'm that girl now.

846
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.335
What girl?

847
01:02:16.412 --> 01:02:18.515
The girl in every story
who doesn't see it coming


848
01:02:18.539 --> 01:02:19.915
'til it's too late.

849
01:02:21.993 --> 01:02:25.462
I knew that he was
abusive and controlling.


850
01:02:26.164 --> 01:02:29.182
But I thought that
if I played nice,


851
01:02:29.258 --> 01:02:32.176
It'd make the process easier.

852
01:02:32.254 --> 01:02:36.306
I thought that we could be
adults about the separation.


853
01:02:37.476 --> 01:02:40.393
I feel so stupid.

854
01:02:41.163 --> 01:02:42.979
You're not stupid.

855
01:02:45.016 --> 01:02:48.818
It's like he knows when
I coming and going,


856
01:02:48.853 --> 01:02:50.670
Like he's monitoring me somehow.

857
01:02:50.705 --> 01:02:53.156
He doesn't seem that clever.

858
01:02:53.191 --> 01:02:55.441
But...

859
01:02:55.476 --> 01:02:57.577
Anything's possible.

860
01:03:03.335 --> 01:03:06.519
So what do you think it was?

861
01:03:06.554 --> 01:03:07.862
What?

862
01:03:07.939 --> 01:03:13.760
I mean, what
attracted you to Paul?


863
01:03:15.013 --> 01:03:18.014
Was it the danger at first?

864
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:20.100
Like a moth to a flame?

865
01:03:21.811 --> 01:03:25.254
It sounds like you already
have a theory, so...


866
01:03:25.331 --> 01:03:27.065
I'd like your perspective.

867
01:03:32.897 --> 01:03:34.930
Well, he definitely
wasn't boring.


868
01:03:35.008 --> 01:03:37.250
When we first started dating.

869
01:03:37.285 --> 01:03:40.620
He was different from all
the people I'd grown up with.


870
01:03:40.655 --> 01:03:43.397
Was a little rough
around the edges,


871
01:03:43.475 --> 01:03:46.001
But he never got
violent until...


872
01:03:53.367 --> 01:03:55.796
Sorry if I
interrupted your work.


873
01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.829
I feel like I run over here
every time I have a problem.


874
01:03:58.907 --> 01:04:02.308
Hey, I like having you here.

875
01:04:04.504 --> 01:04:07.439
And I've got something that
I think will cheer you up.


876
01:04:10.252 --> 01:04:11.842
What is it?

877
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.528
I started a new episode.

878
01:04:14.606 --> 01:04:16.239
That's great.

879
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:17.801
What's it about?

880
01:04:17.825 --> 01:04:19.887
Really early stages right now.

881
01:04:19.911 --> 01:04:21.460
I'm just gathering background.

882
01:04:21.537 --> 01:04:25.615
And trying to understand
how these events unfolded.


883
01:04:25.691 --> 01:04:27.917
The way they did.

884
01:04:27.952 --> 01:04:29.635
Just boring research stuff.

885
01:04:29.712 --> 01:04:32.822
I mean, come on, you
can't give me a hint?


886
01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:35.808
It's a surprise.

887
01:04:35.843 --> 01:04:39.198
Think you're gonna
like it a lot.


888
01:04:39.222 --> 01:04:40.680
Trust me.

889
01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:46.043
But I do have
something very special.


890
01:04:46.121 --> 01:04:49.689
That you can be the first
person to listen to.


891
01:05:22.357 --> 01:05:23.909
What is this?

892
01:05:23.933 --> 01:05:26.476
New theme music.

893
01:05:26.511 --> 01:05:29.362
You like it?

894
01:05:29.438 --> 01:05:30.897
Spooky.

895
01:05:36.354 --> 01:05:39.174
Is the new podcast about her?

896
01:05:39.198 --> 01:05:40.289
Hm?

897
01:05:40.442 --> 01:05:41.932
Maddie fulton.

898
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.677
Is that the surprise?

899
01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:46.287
Nope.

900
01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:51.668
I'm not ready to broach
that subject yet.


901
01:05:54.297 --> 01:05:58.336
Come on, I'll, uh, fix
you something to eat.


902
01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.385
You look famished.

903
01:06:03.949 --> 01:06:07.233
Oh, it's lily! Do you mind?

904
01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:09.561
Tell her I'm taking
great care of you.


905
01:06:51.413 --> 01:06:56.115
<i>Ashley couldn't remember he
last time she felt happy.</i>


906
01:06:56.192 --> 01:07:00.511
<i>Though she appears
free, she is a prisoner.</i>


907
01:07:00.588 --> 01:07:05.510
<i>And Paul, the man she
thought she loved,</i>


908
01:07:05.534 --> 01:07:07.626
<i>Is her warden.</i>

<i>Beautiful, intelligent,
and full of life,</i>


910
01:07:12.116 --> 01:07:15.710
<i>All she knows is torment.</i>

911
01:07:40.445 --> 01:07:44.814
<i>torment that has
become so familiar,</i>


912
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.300
<i>She doesn't even recognize it.</i>

913
01:07:47.335 --> 01:07:51.537
<i>She would learn that she
wasn't safe anywhere.</i>


914
01:07:51.572 --> 01:07:55.141
<i>But her punishment
was yet to come.</i>


915
01:07:55.176 --> 01:08:00.171
<i>Today was just about
sending a message.</i>


916
01:08:47.344 --> 01:08:49.453
Oh, you scared me.

917
01:08:49.531 --> 01:08:51.564
What are you doing?

918
01:08:52.033 --> 01:08:53.883
I'm sorry, I just... I
wanted to hear it again.


919
01:08:53.959 --> 01:08:56.719
And your computer
was open, so...


920
01:08:56.796 --> 01:08:58.354
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have done that.


921
01:08:58.389 --> 01:09:01.441
It's okay. I'm glad you like it.

922
01:09:03.803 --> 01:09:05.803
That's very effective.

923
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.213
Haunting.

924
01:09:07.248 --> 01:09:09.282
It'll go great with
the new episodes.


925
01:09:14.088 --> 01:09:15.056
I should go home.

926
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.407
I don't know that that's wise.

927
01:09:18.484 --> 01:09:20.984
I can't crash here indefinitely.

928
01:09:21.062 --> 01:09:24.397
It's not a problem.

929
01:09:24.432 --> 01:09:26.765
No. It's my house.

930
01:09:26.842 --> 01:09:29.302
I'm not gonna let him
scare me out of it.


931
01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:32.605
Ashley.

932
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.908
Stay vigilant, I know.

933
01:09:35.943 --> 01:09:37.162
I already got the
divorce lawyer.


934
01:09:37.186 --> 01:09:39.512
And he filed the
restraining order.


935
01:09:39.588 --> 01:09:41.614
I'm fighting back.

936
01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.157
Okay.

937
01:09:53.261 --> 01:09:54.577
Thank you.

938
01:09:54.612 --> 01:09:58.539
I feel better that someone I
trust is looking out for me.


939
01:10:05.289 --> 01:10:07.131

01:11:46.982 --> 01:11:47.890
<i>speaking?</i>

964
01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:50.693
Hi, uh, my name is Ashley huff.

965
01:11:50.728 --> 01:11:52.047
I live in los Angeles.

966
01:11:52.071 --> 01:11:53.921
If you're making
cold calls, ma'am,


967
01:11:53.998 --> 01:11:56.915
I suggest you work on your
delivery just a little bit.


968
01:11:56.992 --> 01:11:58.433
No, I'm not a salesperson, sir.

969
01:11:58.511 --> 01:12:02.705
Um, I was hoping to talk to you
about a case that you worked on.


970
01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:05.232
I've been retired
a long time, ma'am.


971
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:06.659
I understand.

972
01:12:06.735 --> 01:12:10.737
This is about mad die
fulton and David Bryant?


973
01:12:14.843 --> 01:12:17.936
<i>mr. Wyler?</i>

974
01:12:18.013 --> 01:12:18.937
Who are you?

975
01:12:19.014 --> 01:12:20.163
I know David.

976
01:12:20.241 --> 01:12:22.725
And I was hoping to talk to you
about what happened back then.


977
01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.001
With mad die.

978
01:12:24.078 --> 01:12:27.112
How well do you
know David Bryant?


979
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:28.667
Not very well.

980
01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:29.765
He's an acquaintance.

981
01:12:29.842 --> 01:12:32.001
<i>well, the less you're
acquainted with him,</i>


982
01:12:32.036 --> 01:12:33.338
<i>The better off you'll be.</i>

983
01:12:33.362 --> 01:12:35.037
<i>I'd break contact
with him immediately.</i>


984
01:12:35.114 --> 01:12:37.273
- Why is that?
- He's a murderer.


985
01:12:37.349 --> 01:12:40.517
<i>Knows how to play the
role, I'll give him that.</i>


986
01:12:40.595 --> 01:12:42.105
<i>Big boy scout.</i>

987
01:12:42.129 --> 01:12:44.780
Federal investigator.

988
01:12:44.857 --> 01:12:48.186
He'll do everything to convince
the people that he's a good guy.


989
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.194
But he's not. He
killed that girl.


990
01:12:51.272 --> 01:12:53.191
<i>And he got away with it.</i>

991
01:12:53.215 --> 01:12:54.364
Maddie fulton?

992
01:12:54.475 --> 01:12:56.700
<i>drove cross country
to take her life.</i>


993
01:12:56.778 --> 01:12:58.961
<i>Couldn't prove
it, but he did it.</i>


994
01:12:58.996 --> 01:13:00.899
I guess that makes
him smarter than me,


995
01:13:00.923 --> 01:13:02.473
But I wasn't fooled.

996
01:13:04.969 --> 01:13:07.620
Why are you askin' about
this? What's goin' on?


997
01:13:07.655 --> 01:13:10.380
I think that I'm next.

998
01:13:10.491 --> 01:13:12.817
Where are you exactly?

999
01:13:16.822 --> 01:13:18.497
Excuse me?

1000
01:13:18.574 --> 01:13:19.782
Yeah?

1001
01:13:19.817 --> 01:13:22.000
Uh, is this your car?

1002
01:13:22.077 --> 01:13:22.985
What's it to you?

1003
01:13:23.062 --> 01:13:25.496
Oh, I'm sorry, man,
I think I nicked it.


1004
01:13:25.573 --> 01:13:27.290
When I was parking here.

1005
01:13:28.676 --> 01:13:30.501
I'll fix it.

1006
01:13:32.355 --> 01:13:34.130
I don't see anything.

1007
01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:54.208
Hello.

1008
01:13:54.285 --> 01:13:55.300
Patrick wyler.

1009
01:13:55.378 --> 01:13:56.763
Are you Ashley?

1010
01:13:56.787 --> 01:13:58.757
No, she's inside.
I'm her friend lily.


1011
01:13:58.781 --> 01:14:01.073
Hi, lily. Want to lead the way?

1012
01:14:04.453 --> 01:14:04.994
Pat.

1013
01:14:05.104 --> 01:14:06.329
Thank you so much for coming.

1014
01:14:06.364 --> 01:14:07.705
Of course.

1015
01:14:12.119 --> 01:14:16.339
So, tell me your story.

1016
01:15:07.249 --> 01:15:10.829
So he's running his own
true crime podcast now?


1017
01:15:10.853 --> 01:15:14.082
unbelievable.

1018
01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:17.233
Yeah, and it's
incredibly popular.


1019
01:15:17.268 --> 01:15:18.442
Huh.

1020
01:15:20.104 --> 01:15:22.405
So why didn't you
call the police?


1021
01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.622
I did.

1022
01:15:23.699 --> 01:15:25.268
And they already thought I
was making everything up.


1023
01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:27.626
When I told them that my
husband was stalking me.


1024
01:15:27.703 --> 01:15:29.186
They're not gonna believe this.

1025
01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:31.855
Yeah, right, they show
up after it's too late.


1026
01:15:31.933 --> 01:15:33.249
yeah.

1027
01:16:13.808 --> 01:16:15.958
All right, this is
what we're gonna do.


1028
01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:18.401
We're gonna head down to
the precinct together.


1029
01:16:18.479 --> 01:16:19.628
Between what you found.

1030
01:16:19.663 --> 01:16:22.298
And what I already
know about David,


1031
01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:24.633
We might have enough
to prove intent.


1032
01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:28.353
And he was obviously
planning something nefarious.


1033
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:30.080
With regards to you.

1034
01:16:30.157 --> 01:16:31.081
You're lucky.

1035
01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:33.559
Did you guys make copies
of these recordings?


1036
01:16:34.453 --> 01:16:36.453
No.

1037
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:38.764
I should've thought
about that. I'm sorry.


1038
01:16:38.841 --> 01:16:41.258
I can try and go
back to his place.


1039
01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:44.369
You have chutzpah,
kid. I respect that.


1040
01:16:44.446 --> 01:16:48.540
But no, no, you already put
yourself in harm's way enough.


1041
01:16:48.617 --> 01:16:49.541
Once they get the warrant,

1042
01:16:49.618 --> 01:16:52.177
They'll be able to
pull this stuff.


1043
01:16:52.212 --> 01:16:54.446
Not bad for a rookie.

1044
01:16:54.523 --> 01:16:57.107
What do you say we
get out of here, hm?


1045
01:16:57.184 --> 01:16:59.460
- Let's go get him.
- Yeah.


1046
01:17:00.504 --> 01:17:02.254
Let's finally put
an end to this.


1047
01:17:10.873 --> 01:17:13.874
Lily! David! Please!

1048
01:17:13.951 --> 01:17:14.975
don't.

1049
01:17:18.405 --> 01:17:20.189
How poetic.

1050
01:17:20.858 --> 01:17:22.558
Just let them go.

1051
01:17:22.634 --> 01:17:23.978
I can't.

1052
01:17:24.002 --> 01:17:25.802
She's integral to the story.

1053
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:31.400
And wyler here makes
this so much better.


1054
01:17:31.476 --> 01:17:33.235
Did you call him?

1055
01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:37.873
I'm not mad.

1056
01:17:37.908 --> 01:17:39.644
It was the right move.

1057
01:17:39.668 --> 01:17:41.393
I knew you were smart.

1058
01:17:41.428 --> 01:17:44.983
You know I don't wanna use this.

1059
01:17:45.007 --> 01:17:48.050
So let's just do
this the easy way.


1060
01:17:48.085 --> 01:17:49.468
Okay?

1061
01:17:51.105 --> 01:17:53.271
It's time to end...

1062
01:18:10.124 --> 01:18:12.608
Shh, just stay calm.

1063
01:18:12.684 --> 01:18:13.993
Not gonna hurt you.

1064
01:18:24.204 --> 01:18:26.589
- Ashley...
- shh! Quiet.


1065
01:18:26.624 --> 01:18:29.508
We don't want any accidents.

1066
01:18:35.466 --> 01:18:37.702
Okay.

1067
01:18:37.726 --> 01:18:39.876
We're ready.

1068
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.795
after years of escalation,

1069
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:54.307
Violence, and mental anguish,

1070
01:18:54.385 --> 01:18:58.804
Paul is served with
a restraining order.


1071
01:18:58.914 --> 01:19:03.976
But he finds his way into one
last showdown with Ashley.


1072
01:19:04.011 --> 01:19:08.230
They are mere feet
from one another.


1073
01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:12.343
All has led to this moment.

1074
01:19:13.353 --> 01:19:14.405
What's going on?

1075
01:19:14.429 --> 01:19:16.321
He wants you to kill me.

1076
01:19:16.356 --> 01:19:19.141
Like he killed mad die fulton.

1077
01:19:19.176 --> 01:19:21.185
I did kill mad die.

1078
01:19:22.863 --> 01:19:28.091
And I've thought about it
every hour of every day.


1079
01:19:28.169 --> 01:19:30.093
Of my life since then.

1080
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:36.171
I haven't slept without
waking to her face.


1081
01:19:36.284 --> 01:19:38.744
And I could never
forgive myself.


1082
01:19:40.698 --> 01:19:44.349
No matter how many
cases I closed,


1083
01:19:44.384 --> 01:19:47.211
No matter how many
people I put away.


1084
01:19:49.707 --> 01:19:51.924
And then I met you.

1085
01:19:53.969 --> 01:19:57.212
And I knew that I had...

1086
01:19:57.289 --> 01:19:58.681
To protect you.

1087
01:20:00.718 --> 01:20:02.351
For her.

1088
01:20:06.557 --> 01:20:09.274
Her story ended in tragedy.

1089
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:14.905
But yours can end in triumph.

1090
01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:19.493
I don't want him to kill you.

1091
01:20:20.645 --> 01:20:24.665
I want you to kill him.

1092
01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:31.505
Finish the story for me, Ashley.

1093
01:20:34.409 --> 01:20:37.336
Forced to the brink,

1094
01:20:37.371 --> 01:20:40.222
Ashley has no other recourse.

1095
01:20:41.441 --> 01:20:47.271
She has to strike him
down to free herself!


1096
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:56.071
You have to take
revenge, Ashley.


1097
01:20:56.957 --> 01:20:59.408
She has to kill him.

1098
01:21:00.678 --> 01:21:02.202
No, I can't.

1099
01:21:04.114 --> 01:21:06.765
The story needs
an ending, Ashley.


1100
01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.686
And you need to give it to us.

1101
01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:11.920
- I won't.
- yes, you will!


1102
01:21:13.774 --> 01:21:16.275
And then what, hm?

1103
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:18.310
Happily ever after
from a jail cell?


1104
01:21:18.386 --> 01:21:21.263
You're gonna tell the whole
world how I murdered him?


1105
01:21:21.298 --> 01:21:23.265
Not quite.

1106
01:21:24.802 --> 01:21:28.020
Every good story needs a twist.

1107
01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:34.492
And every true story
needs a little...


1108
01:21:34.569 --> 01:21:37.905
Creative license.

1109
01:21:42.486 --> 01:21:44.495
Lily?

1110
01:21:46.231 --> 01:21:50.125
The vengeful best friend.

1111
01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.177
Will do what she must.

1112
01:21:52.254 --> 01:21:54.404
To save her friend.

1113
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:57.466
From the big, bad villain...

1114
01:21:57.501 --> 01:22:01.353
From her abuser and the deed.

1115
01:22:01.746 --> 01:22:04.356
Yes, she will
sacrifice her life.


1116
01:22:04.432 --> 01:22:07.692
In the process of
saving her best friend.


1117
01:22:07.769 --> 01:22:11.858
It'll be our
greatest season yet!


1118
01:22:11.882 --> 01:22:13.232
no.

1119
01:22:15.443 --> 01:22:17.319
This is for every woman,

1120
01:22:17.429 --> 01:22:19.423
Every victim,

1121
01:22:19.447 --> 01:22:21.240
Who never had a chance.

1122
01:22:23.602 --> 01:22:26.378
And then you and I
can be together...


1123
01:22:26.454 --> 01:22:27.770
Maddie,

1124
01:22:27.848 --> 01:22:30.415
Like we were always
supposed to be.


1125
01:22:37.524 --> 01:22:39.466
It's okay.

1126
01:22:40.136 --> 01:22:41.802
You can do it.

1127
01:22:43.364 --> 01:22:45.305
wait, wait, wait,
wait, Ashley.


1128
01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:51.547
I'm right here with you.

1129
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:54.125
no, no, no, no no,
please, please.


1130
01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:57.151
Ashley, look at me!

1131
01:22:58.696 --> 01:22:59.987
I'm sorry.

1132
01:23:06.203 --> 01:23:08.453
Ashley...

1133
01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:16.879
Ashley, look out!

1134
01:23:18.899 --> 01:23:20.716
Sorry, mad die.

1135
01:23:22.102 --> 01:23:24.238
I didn't want it
to end this way.


1136
01:23:24.262 --> 01:23:26.296
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

1137
01:23:26.373 --> 01:23:27.723
Ashley!

1138
01:23:47.869 --> 01:23:51.515
You know, I didn't set out
to be the focus of a story.


1139
01:23:51.539 --> 01:23:54.708
This is all still very
uncomfortable for me.


1140
01:23:57.771 --> 01:23:59.938
I get the fascination.

1141
01:23:59.973 --> 01:24:03.050
I was a big fan of
all this stuff too.


1142
01:24:04.035 --> 01:24:07.763
But when it happens to you,

1143
01:24:07.798 --> 01:24:10.966
It definitely changes
your perspective.


1144
01:24:11.042 --> 01:24:13.151
How so?

1145
01:24:13.228 --> 01:24:15.287
All the stuff like true crime,

1146
01:24:15.322 --> 01:24:17.989
You know, the
documentaries, the books,


1147
01:24:18.066 --> 01:24:20.717
The podcasts of course...

1148
01:24:20.794 --> 01:24:24.613
When you become the
subject being discussed,


1149
01:24:24.648 --> 01:24:26.976
<i>You become a public figure.</i>

1150
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.226
<i>And there's this certain
kind of, like, celebrity.</i>


1151
01:24:30.304 --> 01:24:32.487
<i>Or spectacle to it.</i>

1152
01:24:32.564 --> 01:24:34.984
<i>And then people
consume this stuff.</i>


1153
01:24:35.008 --> 01:24:36.419
<i>Without really thinking about.</i>

1154
01:24:36.443 --> 01:24:39.485
<i>The real world consequences
of the people involved.</i>


1155
01:24:39.563 --> 01:24:43.915
<i>And it's not something
that any of us asked for.</i>


1156
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:46.904
And coming from the
other side of it,


1157
01:24:46.928 --> 01:24:49.912
I guess you could say...

1158
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:53.225
I can't really enjoy these
things the same way anymore.


1159
01:24:55.162 --> 01:24:56.919
You know, we're just people...

1160
01:24:56.997 --> 01:25:00.148
People who had terrible
things happen to us.


1161
01:25:00.183 --> 01:25:02.901
We didn't choose our roles.

1162
01:25:02.936 --> 01:25:07.990
And then we become defined by
these horrible experiences.


1163
01:25:08.025 --> 01:25:12.411
And after everything happened,
that became truly clear to me.


1164
01:25:13.621 --> 01:25:17.015
You know, some outlets
painted me as this hero.


1165
01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:18.941
Who took on evil and won.

1166
01:25:19.019 --> 01:25:23.855
And then others painted me as
this helpless, victimized woman.


1167
01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:27.778
Who barely escaped
by the grace of god.


1168
01:25:27.802 --> 01:25:31.229
But the truth is, is that
I'm neither, you know?


1169
01:25:31.306 --> 01:25:32.897
I'm just Ashley.

1170
01:25:32.974 --> 01:25:34.933
That's an interesting
perspective.


1171
01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960
Ashley, I wanna
thank you so much.


1172
01:25:38.038 --> 01:25:39.796
For joining us today.

1173
01:25:39.873 --> 01:25:42.740
I have one question left.

1174
01:25:42.817 --> 01:25:45.060
How do you feel about David now?

1175
01:25:45.136 --> 01:25:50.032
I mean, he's turned you into
the main character of his story.


1176
01:25:51.084 --> 01:25:53.643
You must hate him.

1177
01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.479
I don't hate David.

1178
01:25:56.557 --> 01:25:59.207
You know, he was sick.

1179
01:25:59.242 --> 01:26:01.209
I hate the things that he did.

1180
01:26:03.246 --> 01:26:05.230
But the truth is, is that
I don't spend much time.


1181
01:26:05.265 --> 01:26:07.174
Thinking about that anymore.

1182
01:26:08.385 --> 01:26:11.236
You know, I think
about his victims.


1183
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:14.973
I think about mad die and
her family, and even Paul.


1184
01:26:17.852 --> 01:26:22.166
And I choose now
to devote my time.


1185
01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:24.900
To work towards helping
and healing those of us.


1186
01:26:24.935 --> 01:26:28.195
Who've been through
traumatic events.
