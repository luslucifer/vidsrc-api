1
00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:17.413
Tonight, we uncover
a heavy stream of reports


2
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.449
of a disease outbreak
more deadly than cancer.


3
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:25.054
Common symptoms include
large blisters on the skin


4
00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:26.555
from sun exposure.

5
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.295
News reports confirm
the recent discovery


6
00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:34.997
that blood donation facilities

7
00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:36.565
have knowingly
been distributing blood


8
00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.734
to these so-called vampires
around the world.


9
00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.202
...only now discovered
the aggressiveness


10
00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:42.037
of this new mutated disease.

11
00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.273
Doctors are baffled
at the sheer number of people


12
00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:46.108
affected by this disease

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.744
and how it's been hidden
for so long, up until now.


14
00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:50.713
This is a result
of deficiencies


15
00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:53.115
of active enzymes
in the liver and skin.


16
00:00:53.117 --> 00:00:57.219
It was first discovered
by King George III of England


17
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:01.123
in 1811, when he was diagnosed
with this disease.


18
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.525
After several rumored attacks,
a person claiming to be


19
00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:05.294
one of the vampire
sectional leaders


20
00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.329
has come forward
to make an official statement


21
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:09.732
and address
the public's concerns.


22
00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:12.267
This is simply
a disease that we are


23
00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:14.203
that we are suffering from.

24
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:17.172
We are, uh, we are not monsters.

25
00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:19.675
We are simply people
trying to survive.


26
00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:22.311
<i>What about the news reports
of vampires using</i>


27
00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:24.079
<i>blood-donation facilities?</i>

28
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:26.315
Well, I'd like
to make a point about that.


29
00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:29.785
The-the-the people
who have donated blood


30
00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:32.488
have done so
on a voluntary basis.


31
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.025
No one was forced to give blood

32
00:01:36.027 --> 00:01:38.627
at these
participating facilities.


33
00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:42.097
<i>Is there anything else you'd
like to tell our audience?</i>


34
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.099
Uh...

35
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:47.503
W- we have feelings
just like anybody else.


36
00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:49.371
We, uh...

37
00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:51.507
We just want
to co-exist in peace.


38
00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.676
We don't wanna hurt anyone
in any way, shape or form.


39
00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:59.415
And we sincerely hope that
people feel that way about us.


40
00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:16.698
<i>- It's, this is on.
- ...get this gig.</i>


41
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.635
<i>- Sure you wanna...
- Yeah. Okay.</i>


42
00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:22.771
Hi. Uh, I
-I'm Benny. This is...

43
00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:25.207
This is my first time
out in the field.


44
00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.509
I thought it'd be great
to document my experience


45
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:32.247
because I'm gonna be joining
that team in there.


46
00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.550
<i>That's Mike.
That dude's a legend.</i>


47
00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:37.386
<i>He's one of the biggest names
as far as documentarians go.</i>


48
00:02:37.388 --> 00:02:39.221
<i>He actually uncovered
the evidence that linked</i>


49
00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:41.523
<i>the blood donation facilities
to all the vampires.</i>


50
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:44.726
I swear to God, there is
something seriously wrong.


51
00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:47.229
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not kidding.


52
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:49.832
<i>There's Carrie.
She's pretty hot, isn't she?</i>


53
00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.534
<i>She's been Mike's
right-hand man, uh, woman</i>


54
00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:53.802
<i>since the beginning.</i>

55
00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:56.371
Not everyone can be
as slop as you.


56
00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.740
<i>Oh, and that's Aaron.
He's my sister's husband.</i>


57
00:02:58.742 --> 00:03:00.476
<i>He sort of runs the station.</i>

58
00:03:00.478 --> 00:03:01.877
<i>Think he's about to announce</i>

59
00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.413
<i>that I'm gonna be joining
the team.</i>


60
00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:06.548
Okay. So...

61
00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:10.552
We just got the go ahead

62
00:03:10.554 --> 00:03:12.588
to film
that supposed vampire family.


63
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.289
Alright! I knew it.

64
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.325
I'm sure
they're just a bunch of nuts


65
00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:18.160
but it'll be good
for the ratings.


66
00:03:18.162 --> 00:03:20.395
I figured they were
gonna give it to us


67
00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:21.663
when we broke the story.

68
00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:24.166
Now, we gotta go over
a few things.


69
00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:27.136
- Okay.
- One...


70
00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:30.472
They only want three people
in the house.


71
00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:33.308
Hold on a second, Aaron,
you know we have a crew


72
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.745
of ten, uh, seven, minimum
to be able to do the job.


73
00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:39.481
You're gonna have three
this time. That's all they want.


74
00:03:39.483 --> 00:03:42.551
That's the way they want it,
that's the way it's gonna be.


75
00:03:42.553 --> 00:03:45.354
Fine. Uh, do you want
to give Evan a call?


76
00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:46.788
I mean,
he's good at multitasking.


77
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.158
Probably call Don.
He's probably available.


78
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.325
- He just finished...
- Uh...


79
00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:52.895
- You're taking Benny.
- Benny?


80
00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:54.796
As-as in your-your
brother-in-law?


81
00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:56.331
As in my brother-in-law.

82
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.734
Uh, Aaron, he doesn't have
the proper experience


83
00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:00.269
to be on this crew.

84
00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:02.237
He'll be fine.

85
00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.273
I'm sick and tired
of my wife breaking


86
00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:06.708
my balls I don't give this kid
enough to do.


87
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.943
I'm sure you can appreciate

88
00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:09.411
the importance of me being...

89
00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:11.680
He'll be fine.
Benny, get in here!


90
00:04:11.682 --> 00:04:13.715
And turn
that goddamn camera off!


91
00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:15.851
<i>Oh, shit. Coming.</i>

92
00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.690
You'll be working
with Mike and Carrie


93
00:04:21.692 --> 00:04:23.225
on that vampire story.

94
00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:26.295
<i>- Is that camera off?
- Oh, yeah. It-it's off.</i>


95
00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:27.963
I'm gonna go over this with you.

96
00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:32.734
While you're in the house

97
00:04:32.736 --> 00:04:34.770
you may not bring with you...

98
00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:39.608
any crosses, rosary beads...

99
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:43.946
holy water, steaks...

100
00:04:43.948 --> 00:04:45.647
This is ridiculous.

101
00:04:46.916 --> 00:04:48.584
Look, this is what they want.

102
00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:51.220
Well, how do we know
they're not gonna infect us


103
00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:52.354
or kill us?

104
00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:55.657
They're not gonna infect
or kill you.


105
00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.926
Now, this is all coming
from the sect leader.


106
00:04:57.928 --> 00:04:59.561
Well, what is a sect leader?

107
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.631
The sectional leader.

108
00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:04.967
He's the one
that arranged all this.


109
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.904
They want you
to go there tonight.


110
00:05:08.906 --> 00:05:11.974
While you're in the house,
I want you to report to me.


111
00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:14.309
Aye-aye, captain.

112
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:15.944
- Any other questions?
- Oh, uh...


113
00:05:15.946 --> 00:05:17.512
Oh, shuck.

114
00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:19.348
Do we have permission
to stake them


115
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.751
in the heart
if they vamp out on us?


116
00:05:22.753 --> 00:05:25.988
Mike, you're in charge here.

117
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.757
So you fuck up, you know what.

118
00:05:30.827 --> 00:05:32.394
Thanks, Aaron.

119
00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:34.563
- You're in trouble.
- I'm not in trouble.


120
00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:35.998
I wish I had that recorded

121
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.633
so I could play it back.

122
00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:39.968
<i>Actually I, 
I did record it.</i>

123
00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:43.338
- Really?
- That...


124
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.773
<i>Yeah. I
-I thought it'd be...</i>

125
00:05:44.775 --> 00:05:46.808
That's good.
Can you shut the camera off?


126
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.443
I thought you'd do that.

127
00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:56.051
I never stop rollin'... bitch.

128
00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:58.287
<i>Benny, quit jerkin' off!</i>

129
00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.321
Alright.

130
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:03.425
She's a little cranky right now

131
00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:05.460
<i>since Carrie and him,
you know...</i>


132
00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:07.963
You understand how expensive
a Lavalier mic is?


133
00:06:07.965 --> 00:06:09.798
<i>Today's our first day
of production.</i>


134
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.433
<i>We just got
the official word</i>


135
00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:13.035
<i>that we've been granted
exclusive access...</i>


136
00:06:13.037 --> 00:06:16.071
Benny. Benny,
pay attention. Okay?


137
00:06:16.073 --> 00:06:17.506
These batteries are charged,
right?


138
00:06:17.508 --> 00:06:19.007
<i>- Uh...
- Did you...</i>


139
00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.843
Did you charge the other ones
like I asked you to?


140
00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:23.478
<i>Uh, yeah.
They're almost ready.</i>


141
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.946
- This should be filmed.
- Alright, Carrie...


142
00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:26.982
Can you take notes?
We're gonna take inventory.


143
00:06:26.984 --> 00:06:29.084
Yeah.

144
00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:31.520
Come on, Benny, let's do this.
Call it out.


145
00:06:31.522 --> 00:06:33.655
<i>Alright,
we have two main DSLRs.</i>


146
00:06:35.358 --> 00:06:37.726
<i>- Okay, there's one.
- Two DSLRs.</i>


147
00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:40.529
- Battery is in here.
- Alright.


148
00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:41.863
- Keep it goin'.
- What else?


149
00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:44.466
<i>And then we got
two of these handhelds.</i>


150
00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:47.402
- You've the case for this?
- No, you have the case for...


151
00:06:47.404 --> 00:06:49.438
Benny, you're gonna
get the case for this.


152
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.073
Come on, I don't have all day.

153
00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:53.041
<i>We've three of these
hidden IP cameras</i>


154
00:06:53.043 --> 00:06:55.477
<i>capable of transmitting
their signal to a phone app.</i>


155
00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.979
Check these things out.
These are bad-ass, huh?


156
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:01.116
Mm-hmm. What else?

157
00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:05.454
<i>Uh, we also have this Hi8.</i>

158
00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:06.688
<i>- Hi8.
- Okay...</i>


159
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.523
Why are you bringing
a Hi8 along?


160
00:07:08.525 --> 00:07:10.025
<i>For night vision.</i>

161
00:07:10.027 --> 00:07:12.461
<i>I thought
it'd be cool to have and stuff.</i>


162
00:07:12.463 --> 00:07:15.030
Yeah, that's gonna come in
real handy, Benny.


163
00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:19.434
Oh, uh, and last but not least

164
00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:21.937
<i>we have two of these
wireless HD micro cameras.</i>


165
00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:24.806
<i>They're the size
of a shirt button.</i>


166
00:07:24.808 --> 00:07:27.042
Can I get one
to spy on my roommate?


167
00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:28.677
You wanna spy on your roommate?

168
00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:29.911
- Yeah, I'm positive.
- We could've...


169
00:07:29.913 --> 00:07:32.114
- Oh, my God, please.
- What?


170
00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:34.149
It's not like
I haven't seen it before.


171
00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:35.584
Oh, my God!

172
00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:37.652
- Uh, alright, Benny...
- Is that it?


173
00:07:37.654 --> 00:07:39.488
Okay, it's really cute
that you're filming


174
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.523
but can you stop?
I mean, I don't...


175
00:07:41.525 --> 00:07:44.526
Or why are you filming?
I don't even understand.


176
00:07:44.528 --> 00:07:46.161
<i>Well, I'm also documenting
the journey.</i>


177
00:07:46.163 --> 00:07:48.830
<i>You know,
so we can get everything.</i>


178
00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:53.602
That's good. Why don't you cut
and help us load up the gear?


179
00:07:53.604 --> 00:07:56.138
Start by getting the case
for this handheld.


180
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.606
- Please...
- Really?


181
00:07:57.608 --> 00:07:59.040
- Yeah.
- Why don't you shut up?


182
00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:00.675
- Right.
- Did you finish the inventory?


183
00:08:00.677 --> 00:08:01.977
I can't read your handwriting.

184
00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:04.045
Benny,
the case for this handheld.


185
00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:06.181
Let's load up the truck.
Come on.


186
00:08:10.787 --> 00:08:13.789
Do you remember what I said
when we first started dating?


187
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:15.690
<i>They are still at it.</i>

188
00:08:15.692 --> 00:08:17.192
What are you talking about?

189
00:08:17.194 --> 00:08:19.027
You honestly don't remember
what I said?


190
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:21.463
No, I don't remember.
That was five years ago.


191
00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:23.899
It's nice to know
that I had such little meaning...


192
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.934
- Oh, my God, fucking, drop it.
- Fine.


193
00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:28.103
Wait here.

194
00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:32.841
<i>- W-where's he going?
- Beats me.</i>


195
00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:38.146
<i>What the hell?
Is he running into that church?</i>


196
00:08:38.148 --> 00:08:39.948
No, he's coming back now.

197
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.118
<i>Sounds like you two had
some issues to work out?</i>


198
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.554
Yeah, sorry about that,
he's good at his job


199
00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:47.689
but he could be
an arrogant prick sometimes.


200
00:08:51.527 --> 00:08:54.496
<i>- Holy water.
- Is that what you were doing?</i>


201
00:08:54.498 --> 00:08:56.498
Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.133
<i>Thought Aaron said
we weren't supposed...</i>


203
00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:00.168
You know what,
Aaron's not the one there


204
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.003
riskin' his neck, is he?

205
00:09:03.072 --> 00:09:04.706
So fuck him!

206
00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:14.015
Fuck. I'm kinda freaked out.

207
00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:16.985
Wow! This looks straight
out of a horror movie.


208
00:09:16.987 --> 00:09:21.556
I guess they have a flair
for the theatrics, don't they?


209
00:09:21.558 --> 00:09:23.592
Maybe one of us should grab
the gear...


210
00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:25.760
<i>Hello.</i>

211
00:09:25.762 --> 00:09:28.530
<i>Hi. You guys
are the camera crew, right?</i>


212
00:09:28.532 --> 00:09:31.700
<i>- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah, that's the wrong house.</i>


213
00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:34.636
<i>That was abandoned.
We live over here.</i>


214
00:09:34.638 --> 00:09:36.905
<i>You honestly thought
we lived there?</i>


215
00:09:36.907 --> 00:09:38.807
No, uh, our station manager

216
00:09:38.809 --> 00:09:41.643
just must've given us
the wrong address.


217
00:09:41.645 --> 00:09:44.145
Fuck, if that's
not embarrassing.


218
00:09:44.147 --> 00:09:46.781
Alright, remember,
uh, nice and polite.


219
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.954
- Hi, I'm Mike.
- Hi. Hi, Mike.


220
00:09:52.956 --> 00:09:54.256
I'll be conducting
the interviews.


221
00:09:54.258 --> 00:09:56.224
Elleanor.
But you can call me Elle.


222
00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:58.059
Elle, lemme
introduce you to the crew.


223
00:09:58.061 --> 00:09:59.294
This is Carrie,
running sound.


224
00:09:59.296 --> 00:10:00.929
- Hi, Carrie.
- Nice to meet you.


225
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:02.564
And behind the lens,
that's Benny.


226
00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:03.865
He's operating the camera.

227
00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:05.667
<i>- Hi, Benny.
- Hi.</i>


228
00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:09.271
I guess I'll have to get used
to having a camera around.


229
00:10:09.273 --> 00:10:12.541
Um, okay.
Everyone, please, come inside.


230
00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:21.917
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.


231
00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:24.920
The camera crew
from the news station is here.


232
00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:27.756
Oh, can you get a shot
of that mirror, please? Benny.


233
00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:30.792
<i>- Copy that.
- The mirror? Where?</i>


234
00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.827
Oh, I see.

235
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:34.696
No, we're not as, uh, mystical

236
00:10:34.698 --> 00:10:37.699
as Hollywood
has made us up to be.


237
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:41.736
I'm glad that you're here
to dispel that image.


238
00:10:41.738 --> 00:10:44.573
I'm gonna get started on dinner,
leave you guys to it.


239
00:10:44.575 --> 00:10:46.308
- Okay.
- Where's Blake and Selvin?


240
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.844
I just saw Blake. I think Selvin
is off hiding in the basement.


241
00:10:49.846 --> 00:10:51.680
Okay, so who do we have here?

242
00:10:51.682 --> 00:10:53.715
- Oh, I'm Mike.
- How are you doing, Mike?


243
00:10:53.717 --> 00:10:54.816
- I'm Andrew.
- Hi. Carrie.


244
00:10:54.818 --> 00:10:56.051
- Carrie.
- Nice to meet you.


245
00:10:56.053 --> 00:10:58.320
- This is Benny.
- Hi, Benny.


246
00:10:58.322 --> 00:11:01.856
- Thanks for havin' us.
- My pleasure.


247
00:11:01.858 --> 00:11:03.058
- Well, this is...
- Blake.


248
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.693
Blake, this is the camera crew

249
00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:05.927
that I told you about.

250
00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:08.630
Oh! Hey-hey. I'm Blake.

251
00:11:08.632 --> 00:11:10.365
I'm really excited
to have you guys.


252
00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:12.801
Yeah, Blake, you should show 'em
to their rooms


253
00:11:12.803 --> 00:11:15.604
let 'em get settled, we'll have
some supper or somethin'.


254
00:11:15.606 --> 00:11:18.340
What kind of supper
did you have in mind?


255
00:11:18.342 --> 00:11:20.976
Supper. Food. Um...

256
00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:22.978
Another...
Oh...


257
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.813
You don't have anything
to worry about.


258
00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.648
We've been dining with humans
for years.


259
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.916
- Oh.
- And on them.


260
00:11:30.953 --> 00:11:33.955
- He's kidding.
- I'm kidding. Just kidding.


261
00:11:33.957 --> 00:11:35.824
Maybe, we're...
Is that working?


262
00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:37.325
- Yeah.
- Could we just start over?


263
00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.160
Well, we can just erase
that part.


264
00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:40.962
- Erase it. Thanks. Okay.
- Yeah.


265
00:11:40.964 --> 00:11:42.197
Yeah. We'll erase that part.

266
00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:43.798
Upstairs.

267
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.200
Okay. Come on.

268
00:11:45.202 --> 00:11:48.036
Uh, actually, is it,
is it possible to pull our truck


269
00:11:48.038 --> 00:11:50.305
into the driveway
to unload our equipment?


270
00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:51.973
Sure. That's why you're here.

271
00:11:51.975 --> 00:11:53.041
- Great.
- Great.


272
00:11:53.043 --> 00:11:54.676
Alright, we'll back in a minute.

273
00:11:54.678 --> 00:11:57.045
- Benny, put down the camera.
- Thanks.


274
00:11:57.047 --> 00:11:58.079
Benny!

275
00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:01.683
Alright. Right this way.

276
00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:03.752
<i>- I'm on camera, right?
- Yep, we got you.</i>


277
00:12:03.754 --> 00:12:06.721
Okay, cool, this is
my good side, so you can get...


278
00:12:06.723 --> 00:12:09.724
This place is pretty amazing.
How long have you lived here?


279
00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:11.359
Yeah, 12 years, you know?

280
00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:13.895
But, uh, I'm really excited
to have you guys.


281
00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:16.398
I mean, I personally insisted
that you guys come.


282
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.433
Yeah. I've always wanted
to be on TV.


283
00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:20.035
Why's that?

284
00:12:20.037 --> 00:12:22.070
You know, we stayed out
of the limelight


285
00:12:22.072 --> 00:12:24.439
all these years because,
you know, whatever...


286
00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:27.709
The cat's out of the bag now,
so this is my chance


287
00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:30.245
to be famous, so...
I'm gonna show you guys around.


288
00:12:30.247 --> 00:12:31.880
Gonna show you the inside scoop.

289
00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:33.348
Okay. Sounds great. Thanks.

290
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.850
You guys let me know
if you need anything


291
00:12:35.852 --> 00:12:37.719
anything at all, okay?

292
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:40.889
- Where's that stair going?
- Oh, yeah. Right, right here.


293
00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:45.193
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, once you guys in here...


294
00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:46.828
This is where he wants you.

295
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.997
So just, you know, get settled

296
00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:51.366
and, uh, when you guys are ready

297
00:12:51.368 --> 00:12:53.401
come downstairs,
we got some delish food, okay?


298
00:12:53.403 --> 00:12:54.969
<i>Awesome. Sounds good.</i>

299
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:57.005
This is gonna be
in the documentary, right?


300
00:12:57.007 --> 00:12:58.773
- Yeah, I mean, you know...
- Okay.


301
00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:00.175
- Come on back down.
- Okay.


302
00:13:01.977 --> 00:13:03.812
Carrie, looks like
you and I can...


303
00:13:03.814 --> 00:13:05.213
I'm gonna take the single

304
00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:07.882
and you and Benny
are gonna share the queen.


305
00:13:09.952 --> 00:13:12.487
Great.

306
00:13:12.489 --> 00:13:15.323
<i>Here, put this on. They won't
know you're recording 'em.</i>


307
00:13:17.827 --> 00:13:20.028
<i>Do you need some help
putting it on?</i>


308
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.229
Can you help me?

309
00:13:22.998 --> 00:13:25.033
Just put it right
in that button hole.


310
00:13:28.738 --> 00:13:31.239
<i>- Is it hidden enough?
- Lemme check the camera feed.</i>


311
00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:34.509
<i>Pretty good.</i>

312
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:39.347
Uh, seems like
the signal's weak or something.


313
00:13:39.349 --> 00:13:41.416
We don't time
to fix it right now.


314
00:13:41.418 --> 00:13:43.251
Just make my micro-cam
the B cam


315
00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:45.520
and use the A. Let's go.

316
00:13:46.422 --> 00:13:47.455
Okay.

317
00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:51.059
<i>- Well, the music they blocked...
- Shit.</i>


318
00:13:59.368 --> 00:14:03.037
Ah, hello, good evening.
Come, sit. Eat.


319
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.074
- Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.


320
00:14:06.076 --> 00:14:07.509
Thanks.

321
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:15.917
<i>- You are welcome to sit as well.
- Oh. Thanks. I'll stand.</i>


322
00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:18.987
It's his job
to operate the camera, so...


323
00:14:18.989 --> 00:14:20.488
Oh, I see.

324
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.525
Uh, uh, well,
so wh-what do you two do?


325
00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:27.428
Oh, um, I run sound,
I operate equipment.


326
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.265
- Take notes. Stuff like that.
- Uh-huh. And you, Mike?


327
00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:31.966
I conduct the interviews.

328
00:14:31.968 --> 00:14:34.135
You know,
ask questions, keep it goin'.


329
00:14:34.137 --> 00:14:36.938
So you're, like,
the face of the documentary?


330
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.406
You could say that,
but ultimately


331
00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:40.008
the story's about you.

332
00:14:41.577 --> 00:14:43.044
Righteous, man.

333
00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:45.847
That's Blake.
And this is Selvin.


334
00:14:45.849 --> 00:14:49.250
Selvin is a... is a quiet one
in the family.


335
00:14:49.252 --> 00:14:50.885
You know, he's a little shy

336
00:14:50.887 --> 00:14:52.921
but once he knows you,
he'll warm up.


337
00:14:52.923 --> 00:14:54.155
- Alright.
- Here you go.


338
00:14:54.157 --> 00:14:56.057
- Oh, thank you.
- Selvin, sit down.


339
00:14:56.059 --> 00:14:58.359
Oh. Um, what is it?

340
00:14:59.829 --> 00:15:01.596
Oh, that's a, uh, ham steak.

341
00:15:01.598 --> 00:15:03.031
That's from a pig.

342
00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:06.100
Of course. I'm sorry, I...

343
00:15:06.102 --> 00:15:08.036
- I...
- Give us a little credit.


344
00:15:08.038 --> 00:15:09.604
We've been entertaining
for centuries.


345
00:15:09.606 --> 00:15:12.240
We do know
how to make you guys a meal.


346
00:15:12.242 --> 00:15:13.942
Sorry if Carrie offended you.

347
00:15:13.944 --> 00:15:16.010
Hm, it's quite alright.

348
00:15:16.012 --> 00:15:18.146
Um, are you gonna be eating?

349
00:15:18.148 --> 00:15:19.347
<i>- Um...
- Uh, yeah.</i>


350
00:15:19.349 --> 00:15:22.150
No, no, no.
He'll-he'll eat later.


351
00:15:23.085 --> 00:15:25.420
Um, what about you guys?

352
00:15:25.422 --> 00:15:28.089
<i>- Oh, uh...
- Are you eating?</i>


353
00:15:28.091 --> 00:15:29.357
Us, as you know, we're...

354
00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:30.992
Our diet consists of something

355
00:15:30.994 --> 00:15:32.894
a little bit different.

356
00:15:32.896 --> 00:15:35.129
It's kind of a,
kind of a liquid diet.


357
00:15:35.131 --> 00:15:37.232
Oh, so that's blood?

358
00:15:37.234 --> 00:15:39.567
It's blood
from the Czech Republic.


359
00:15:42.204 --> 00:15:45.373
So you guys
don't hunt humans for food?


360
00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:49.310
Hm. Goodness, no.

361
00:15:49.312 --> 00:15:52.647
That would be like, you hunted
that pig for your supper.


362
00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:56.517
- Well, there are actually some...
- Blake, you're interrupting.


363
00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:58.620
It's all automated now.

364
00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:03.057
We live our lives
pretty much just like you


365
00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:06.561
except our diet's
a little different.


366
00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:09.030
Yes, and one could say
it's even kinder


367
00:16:09.032 --> 00:16:12.533
because we accept
blood donations.


368
00:16:12.535 --> 00:16:15.470
So there isn't any killing
of any people anymore.


369
00:16:15.472 --> 00:16:18.006
So you don't bite people
on the necks?


370
00:16:20.377 --> 00:16:23.978
Uh, please,
by all means, begin eating.


371
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.415
To answer your question, no, we
do not bite people on the necks.


372
00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:29.183
Not at all.

373
00:16:29.185 --> 00:16:33.588
Um... there's no need.

374
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.623
As you are aware,
blood is donated freely


375
00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:38.192
from numerous sources
around the world.


376
00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:40.228
Wow, this food is really good.

377
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.297
Elle's a good cook, isn't she?

378
00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:44.432
I've had many years
to perfect it.


379
00:16:44.434 --> 00:16:46.567
Exactly how many years
would that be?


380
00:16:46.569 --> 00:16:48.236
If you're trying to figure out

381
00:16:48.238 --> 00:16:51.072
how old I am, let me remind you,
it's considered rude


382
00:16:51.074 --> 00:16:53.341
to ask a woman's age,
regardless of species.


383
00:16:54.243 --> 00:16:55.510
Point taken.

384
00:16:55.512 --> 00:16:57.345
Alrighty then,
as guests in the house


385
00:16:57.347 --> 00:17:00.415
I've to run a few rules
by you, if you don't mind.


386
00:17:00.417 --> 00:17:01.449
Okay.

387
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:04.619
First, um...

388
00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:07.055
there can't be any filming
of our, uh, rituals


389
00:17:07.057 --> 00:17:09.958
our ceremonies.

390
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.527
Well, in order for us
to completely capture


391
00:17:12.529 --> 00:17:14.028
your lifestyle,
we've to have...


392
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.163
No, no, no.

393
00:17:15.165 --> 00:17:17.532
No cameras, no filming...

394
00:17:17.534 --> 00:17:19.000
of ceremonies.

395
00:17:19.002 --> 00:17:20.435
Okay.

396
00:17:20.437 --> 00:17:22.270
Second of all,
we can't allow you


397
00:17:22.272 --> 00:17:23.972
to go down into the basement.

398
00:17:23.974 --> 00:17:26.040
You can freely run around
in the house


399
00:17:26.042 --> 00:17:28.476
but the basement is off limits.

400
00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:31.479
There's a lot of old heirlooms
down there that, uh


401
00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:34.115
we don't wanna see
anything happen to...


402
00:17:34.117 --> 00:17:35.516
- That understood?
- Absolutely.


403
00:17:35.518 --> 00:17:38.019
Understood. We understand.

404
00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:39.654
And finally, um

405
00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:43.558
you can't, uh, disturb us during
the day when we're sleeping.


406
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.728
Yep. It's absolutely essential
that we rest during those hours


407
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.363
so that
we can function properly.


408
00:17:48.365 --> 00:17:52.667
- It's essential.
- With no exceptions.


409
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:55.570
Okay, well,
as guests of your house


410
00:17:55.572 --> 00:17:57.705
we will follow
all of your rules.


411
00:17:58.707 --> 00:18:00.308
Alrighty then.

412
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.344
So after we eat, what do we do?

413
00:18:06.248 --> 00:18:08.349
Okay, just be careful
not to hit it.


414
00:18:12.087 --> 00:18:15.089
- Is it on properly?
- Yeah, just try not to hit it.


415
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:17.058
- Okay.
- I think we're good.


416
00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:22.230
- Fire away, Mike.
- Great.


417
00:18:22.232 --> 00:18:24.065
Um, could you please start

418
00:18:24.067 --> 00:18:26.401
by stating your name
for the camera?


419
00:18:26.403 --> 00:18:29.704
Uh, my name is Andrew Pritchard.

420
00:18:29.706 --> 00:18:32.774
And what do you do for a living?

421
00:18:32.776 --> 00:18:34.509
Uh, venture.

422
00:18:34.511 --> 00:18:36.611
Uh, I'm sorry,
could you please state it


423
00:18:36.613 --> 00:18:39.080
as a, "I work as..."

424
00:18:39.082 --> 00:18:43.184
Oh, I work
as a venture capitalist.


425
00:18:43.186 --> 00:18:44.752
From the outside perspective

426
00:18:44.754 --> 00:18:48.256
you seem like
an ordinary, ambitious guy.


427
00:18:48.258 --> 00:18:50.224
Sometimes I get a little lazy.

428
00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:52.560
But let's get
to the heart of the matter.


429
00:18:52.562 --> 00:18:56.164
You are a vampire?

430
00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:59.734
What defines me as being a
vampire is that I need albumen.


431
00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:02.670
That's a protein plasma
that's found in blood.


432
00:19:02.672 --> 00:19:05.840
That's my food. That's what
keeps me functioning.


433
00:19:05.842 --> 00:19:07.708
Do you have fangs?

434
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.179
Do I look like I have fangs?

435
00:19:11.181 --> 00:19:15.683
Well, what happens
if you touch a cross?


436
00:19:15.685 --> 00:19:17.718
Oh, I start to get
a tingling feeling


437
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.221
that I can't control it.

438
00:19:20.223 --> 00:19:23.591
No, nothing.
Nothing happens in particular.


439
00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:26.194
Would a stake to the heart
kill you?


440
00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:29.764
Well, wouldn't
a stake to the heart kill you?


441
00:19:29.766 --> 00:19:31.466
<i>What about holy water?</i>

442
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:34.135
Nope.

443
00:19:35.137 --> 00:19:36.804
Sunlight?

444
00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:39.207
Sunlight,
sunlight is a different matter.


445
00:19:39.209 --> 00:19:41.142
Yes, uh,
due to our genetic makeup


446
00:19:41.144 --> 00:19:42.810
we suffer
from exposure to sunlight


447
00:19:42.812 --> 00:19:47.115
because we have a condition
known as cutaneous porphyria


448
00:19:47.117 --> 00:19:50.218
which is where, if we are
exposed to direct sunlight


449
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.423
our skin blisters and burns.

450
00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:58.659
So you're saying that
every myth about vampires


451
00:19:58.661 --> 00:20:01.329
can be explained medically?

452
00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:05.299
Modern science can explain
all of our medical conditions.


453
00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:08.836
And if you go back in time
when people thought to be crazed


454
00:20:08.838 --> 00:20:12.907
or out of their minds, lunatic,
for example...


455
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:18.813
uh, they were characterized
as being possessed by the devil.


456
00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:22.783
- We don't believe that today.
- How old are you, Andrew?


457
00:20:22.785 --> 00:20:26.187
I'm 147 years old.

458
00:20:26.189 --> 00:20:28.456
How is this possible?

459
00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:32.426
Well, the blood that we require
regenerates our cells.


460
00:20:32.428 --> 00:20:34.862
But can you explain, uh, uh

461
00:20:34.864 --> 00:20:37.532
how it-it's possible for your...

462
00:20:37.534 --> 00:20:41.469
Uh, we-we should just move on
from that one.


463
00:20:41.471 --> 00:20:42.803
We, well, um...

464
00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:45.773
<i>- I mean, is it possi...
- Just move on.</i>


465
00:20:45.775 --> 00:20:47.608
Okay.

466
00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.912
Oh, you know, I got a meeting
that that I've got to keep.


467
00:20:50.914 --> 00:20:53.748
I've got to make a living
like you said, right?


468
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.751
So maybe
we could come back to that


469
00:20:56.753 --> 00:20:58.853
at a future time.

470
00:21:03.358 --> 00:21:04.659
Sorry.

471
00:21:06.728 --> 00:21:09.230
Uh-uh, okay,
wh-wh-wh-what just happened?


472
00:21:12.234 --> 00:21:14.569
Right. I'm so excited.
How's my hair?


473
00:21:14.571 --> 00:21:17.205
Can you try not to move
while I'm doing this?


474
00:21:17.207 --> 00:21:19.340
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

475
00:21:19.342 --> 00:21:23.211
<i>- Uh, uh, Benny, right? Oh. Cool.
- Yeah.</i>


476
00:21:23.213 --> 00:21:26.280
<i>- Hey, uh, how close are you?
- Uh, it's about till here.</i>


477
00:21:26.282 --> 00:21:28.583
Okay. So I could move around
a little bit?


478
00:21:28.585 --> 00:21:30.651
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay. I think we're good.</i>


479
00:21:30.653 --> 00:21:31.886
Okay.

480
00:21:31.888 --> 00:21:34.288
Alright, uh, are you ready?

481
00:21:38.227 --> 00:21:39.694
I was born ready.

482
00:21:41.363 --> 00:21:42.630
Okay, can you please start

483
00:21:42.632 --> 00:21:45.533
by stating your name
for the camera?


484
00:21:45.535 --> 00:21:47.468
Uh...

485
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.772
I'm Blake Theodore Slosser I.

486
00:21:51.774 --> 00:21:54.642
And can you state your age
for the camera?


487
00:21:54.644 --> 00:21:57.845
I'm 111 years old, bro.

488
00:21:57.847 --> 00:22:00.314
Tell me about yourself.

489
00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:04.018
Well, uh, I like living in the
fast lane. You know what I mean?


490
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.822
I, uh, feel like, as a vampire,
you know, I can, um


491
00:22:07.824 --> 00:22:09.624
I can live the party lifestyle

492
00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:13.594
without any of the consequences
humans would have.


493
00:22:13.596 --> 00:22:17.031
Well, how long have you been
living your life like this?


494
00:22:17.033 --> 00:22:20.334
Well, probably, ever since I
turned, I think, late 20s.


495
00:22:20.336 --> 00:22:22.370
You see, I-I came
from a poor family.


496
00:22:22.372 --> 00:22:25.640
Didn't have a lot of money,
so I used to make a habit


497
00:22:25.642 --> 00:22:28.476
of stealing food and
one day it caught up to me.


498
00:22:28.478 --> 00:22:30.411
They threw me in jail.

499
00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:33.581
You know,
they sentenced me to hard labor


500
00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:36.384
from a child into adulthood.

501
00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:38.653
I mean, it was miserable.

502
00:22:38.655 --> 00:22:40.488
I didn't get to feel like

503
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.024
what it was like to be free,
to-to have fun.


504
00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:47.295
Uh, and top of it all,
there was this warden who...


505
00:22:47.297 --> 00:22:48.896
He really didn't like me.

506
00:22:48.898 --> 00:22:52.867
So he literally punished me
every chance he got.


507
00:22:52.869 --> 00:22:56.470
I mean, one day
he beat me so bad...


508
00:22:56.472 --> 00:22:58.572
I mean, I was on my death bed.

509
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:02.710
That was the day
that I met Andrew


510
00:23:02.712 --> 00:23:06.480
and that was the day he made me
an offer that I couldn't refuse.


511
00:23:07.716 --> 00:23:09.884
What was the first thing
that you did


512
00:23:09.886 --> 00:23:12.853
when you became a vampire?

513
00:23:12.855 --> 00:23:15.489
Mike, that's a good question.

514
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:18.025
First thing I did was I opened

515
00:23:18.027 --> 00:23:21.429
a can of good, old-fashion
whoop-ass on that warden.


516
00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:23.864
I'm talking about,
I ripped him from limb to limb.


517
00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:26.734
He was begging, begging in ways
I never even imagined possible.


518
00:23:26.736 --> 00:23:28.469
Sweet revenge!

519
00:23:30.872 --> 00:23:32.740
Oh, man.

520
00:23:32.742 --> 00:23:36.510
I was dancin' on his heart,
it was still beatin'.


521
00:23:36.512 --> 00:23:40.414
Refused to even drink his blood.
Such a bastard!


522
00:23:40.416 --> 00:23:44.385
Um, and did you tell
your family?


523
00:23:44.387 --> 00:23:46.854
Uh, I just came here

524
00:23:46.856 --> 00:23:49.757
and, like, this is my family,
you know?


525
00:23:51.626 --> 00:23:53.594
It sounds like quite the life.

526
00:23:55.397 --> 00:23:57.598
Oh, shit, it is now!

527
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.836
Have you ever killed anyone
that you've never met?


528
00:24:01.838 --> 00:24:03.671
Oh, yeah.
Lots of times, I-I...


529
00:24:12.414 --> 00:24:16.650
But you know, um,
not so much anymore.


530
00:24:16.652 --> 00:24:20.621
I see. Uh, do you miss it?

531
00:24:20.623 --> 00:24:22.590
Well, yeah.
I mean, I miss it...


532
00:24:26.762 --> 00:24:31.165
But you know, we... we evolve.

533
00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:32.733
And shit like that.

534
00:24:37.005 --> 00:24:39.540
Well, uh, thank you.

535
00:24:43.879 --> 00:24:45.413
We're done?

536
00:24:45.415 --> 00:24:47.081
<i>Look, we'll do some more later</i>

537
00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:49.583
<i>but that's it for now.</i>

538
00:24:49.585 --> 00:24:53.888
Okay. Well... how do I look?

539
00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.123
<i>- Good.
- Yeah. Cool.</i>


540
00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:58.058
N- no,
you're not listening to me.


541
00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.529
Can't you stop that interview?
How am I supposed to do my job?


542
00:25:01.531 --> 00:25:02.763
That's the whole point, right?

543
00:25:02.765 --> 00:25:04.064
We're here to interview them

544
00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:05.499
then they stop it short?

545
00:25:05.501 --> 00:25:07.501
<i>Yeah, I don't...</i>

546
00:25:07.503 --> 00:25:09.036
<i>- Where, where's Carrie?
- Uh...</i>


547
00:25:09.038 --> 00:25:10.638
Is she in the bathroom?

548
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.606
<i>- What?
- Benny, put...</i>


549
00:25:12.608 --> 00:25:14.475
Okay,
put the fucking camera down.


550
00:25:14.477 --> 00:25:16.210
We're waiting for, um

551
00:25:16.212 --> 00:25:18.746
the-the, that weird,
that weird...


552
00:25:18.748 --> 00:25:20.548
<i>- That weird, what, Selvin...
- Yeah.</i>


553
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.917
I don't know.
Put, put the camera down, Benny.


554
00:25:31.693 --> 00:25:33.627
- Ah! What the fuck?
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!


555
00:25:33.629 --> 00:25:35.696
Oh, Selvin. Sorry.

556
00:25:35.698 --> 00:25:39.500
He's not quite used
to this stuff.


557
00:25:39.502 --> 00:25:42.169
- Should we do this another time?
- No, he needs a minute.


558
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:44.472
Okay, just remember
what we talked about.


559
00:25:50.145 --> 00:25:51.545
Okay.

560
00:25:52.113 --> 00:25:55.115
Okay. Okay.

561
00:25:55.117 --> 00:25:56.951
He's ready.

562
00:25:56.953 --> 00:25:59.119
<i>Okay. Good.</i>

563
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.594
We're good.

564
00:26:09.764 --> 00:26:11.866
Okay.

565
00:26:11.868 --> 00:26:14.935
Could you please state your name
for the camera?


566
00:26:17.706 --> 00:26:21.809
Marten Selvin Trask.

567
00:26:23.812 --> 00:26:25.779
<i>- Marten...
- Now it's Selvin.</i>


568
00:26:27.048 --> 00:26:28.582
Selvin...

569
00:26:29.918 --> 00:26:31.719
can you tell us your age?

570
00:26:34.556 --> 00:26:36.123
<i>Go ahead.</i>

571
00:26:38.293 --> 00:26:40.528
Can you tell us
what you do remember?


572
00:26:43.899 --> 00:26:45.032
Darkness.

573
00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:50.671
<i>- Infinite black darkness!
- Hold! Okay! O-okay! Okay!</i>


574
00:26:50.673 --> 00:26:54.108
Whoa! Alright. Okay. Just...

575
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.912
<i>- Could you just turn that off?
- Okay. It's off.</i>


576
00:26:57.914 --> 00:26:59.947
Okay. Okay.

577
00:26:59.949 --> 00:27:02.182
<i>Okay, obviously,
we need to get some air.</i>


578
00:27:02.184 --> 00:27:04.818
This isn't gonna work.
We're gonna take a break.


579
00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.555
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

580
00:27:13.094 --> 00:27:15.930
Sorry, but, uh, you know

581
00:27:15.932 --> 00:27:19.800
Selvin, he was, he was trapped
in a concrete dungeon for years


582
00:27:19.802 --> 00:27:23.070
and, uh, he wasn't, like,
exposed to any, like


583
00:27:23.072 --> 00:27:25.306
light or interaction,
so he went a little mad


584
00:27:25.308 --> 00:27:28.342
but, uh, he's getting better,
it's a process.


585
00:27:28.344 --> 00:27:31.345
Well, how did he survive
while he was trapped?


586
00:27:31.347 --> 00:27:33.847
The dude mainly fed on rats.

587
00:27:33.849 --> 00:27:35.883
That's terrible.
That's disgusting.


588
00:27:35.885 --> 00:27:38.786
- How long was he down there?
- Over 30 years.


589
00:27:38.788 --> 00:27:41.088
<i>- Holy cow! Thirty years?
- That's what he said, Benny.</i>


590
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.923
Yeah, that's what I said,
but imagine


591
00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:44.358
what that'd do
to your mind.


592
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.794
Like, he was this close
to becoming a dweller.


593
00:27:46.796 --> 00:27:48.362
- I'm sorry, dweller?
- Yeah.


594
00:27:48.364 --> 00:27:51.131
Uh, a, a dweller, it's when, um

595
00:27:51.133 --> 00:27:53.200
a vampire doesn't get
enough blood


596
00:27:53.202 --> 00:27:56.670
they go absolutely mad
and turn into rabid animals.


597
00:27:56.672 --> 00:27:59.106
How did he end up there
in the first place?


598
00:27:59.108 --> 00:28:01.342
Uh, some villagers
chased him there and some shit.


599
00:28:01.344 --> 00:28:03.777
I don't really remember,
but what I do know


600
00:28:03.779 --> 00:28:05.613
is when he got loose,
he single-handedly


601
00:28:05.615 --> 00:28:08.248
went to that village
and tore the shit out of it.


602
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.650
He fuckin' killed everyone.

603
00:28:09.652 --> 00:28:11.752
But, listen,
you guys cannot tell Andrew


604
00:28:11.754 --> 00:28:14.822
that I told you any of this
shit. I'll get in trouble.


605
00:28:14.824 --> 00:28:15.856
- Cool?
- Yeah.


606
00:28:15.858 --> 00:28:17.157
- Yeah.
- Pinky swear?


607
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.893
Yeah.

608
00:28:19.895 --> 00:28:22.296
That's some old-school shit
that we used to do.


609
00:28:22.298 --> 00:28:25.666
Okay, um, can you please start
by stating your name


610
00:28:25.668 --> 00:28:27.401
for the camera?

611
00:28:27.403 --> 00:28:31.238
My name is Elleanor Theona Gray.

612
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.874
And can you state your age,
please?


613
00:28:33.876 --> 00:28:36.377
I've told you I don't wish
to discuss that topic.


614
00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:41.081
Okay. Did Andrew infect you?

615
00:28:41.083 --> 00:28:44.251
Yes, he drained my blood
and infected me with his own


616
00:28:44.253 --> 00:28:46.887
but not for the reasons
that you might think.


617
00:28:46.889 --> 00:28:49.156
I contracted
a severe case of polio.


618
00:28:49.158 --> 00:28:51.392
I was dying
when Andrew gave me the choice


619
00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:53.994
to live or die, so I chose life.

620
00:28:53.996 --> 00:28:55.796
Through vampirism?

621
00:28:55.798 --> 00:28:58.766
Did you know what you were being
offered at the time?


622
00:28:58.768 --> 00:29:00.434
Please understand.

623
00:29:00.436 --> 00:29:03.170
I had a sickly mother
who needed my help.


624
00:29:03.172 --> 00:29:05.406
I didn't want to leave her.

625
00:29:05.408 --> 00:29:08.742
Andrew gave me the greatest gift
that anybody ever could.


626
00:29:08.744 --> 00:29:12.413
So we fell in love
and I married him.


627
00:29:12.415 --> 00:29:14.682
So after you became a vampire

628
00:29:14.684 --> 00:29:16.950
your, your feelings,
they never changed?


629
00:29:16.952 --> 00:29:19.219
No, the misconception
that we turn


630
00:29:19.221 --> 00:29:23.257
into mindless, bloodthirsty
beasts is ridiculous.


631
00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:26.093
My family means as much to me
now as it did


632
00:29:26.095 --> 00:29:27.861
before I was changed.

633
00:29:27.863 --> 00:29:31.365
We need blood, it's what
our bodies require to survive.


634
00:29:31.367 --> 00:29:34.868
It is a small price to pay
for what we get to experience.


635
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.270
And what is that?

636
00:29:36.272 --> 00:29:39.106
We never
have to see ourselves age.


637
00:29:39.108 --> 00:29:43.777
We can watch life and time go by
as coaches change.


638
00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:45.846
And what are the down sides?

639
00:29:45.848 --> 00:29:47.848
Watching those that you love
age ungracefully


640
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.017
and die around you.

641
00:29:50.019 --> 00:29:53.120
I'd say
that's the hardest part for me.


642
00:29:53.122 --> 00:29:55.355
<i>Can you imagine
being trapped for 30 years?</i>


643
00:29:55.357 --> 00:29:58.158
<i>- In complete darkness?
- I know, it's crazy.</i>


644
00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.228
Can you put down that camera
and help us with the gear?


645
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.864
I tell you, that guy
scared the shit outta me.


646
00:30:06.768 --> 00:30:08.435
What? What was it?

647
00:30:08.437 --> 00:30:10.838
I just saw something outside.

648
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.473
<i>- Are you sure?
- I saw it too.</i>


649
00:30:12.475 --> 00:30:14.074
Yes.

650
00:30:25.086 --> 00:30:26.420
There's nothing there now.

651
00:30:29.224 --> 00:30:31.825
I don't know
if I feel like sleeping now.


652
00:30:31.827 --> 00:30:34.528
Hey, listen, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.


653
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.864
- Alright?
- Okay. Nice try.


654
00:30:48.543 --> 00:30:51.044
<i>- Selvin! Selvin!
- Yeah?</i>


655
00:30:51.046 --> 00:30:52.846
<i>Get your ass out here.</i>

656
00:30:54.048 --> 00:30:55.849
What are you doing?

657
00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.055
<i>- What the fuck was that?
- Ah.</i>


658
00:31:02.057 --> 00:31:04.324
<i>Okay, that was
seriously creepy.</i>


659
00:31:04.326 --> 00:31:06.360
What just happened?

660
00:31:06.362 --> 00:31:08.295
<i>You were asleep the whole time?</i>

661
00:31:08.297 --> 00:31:10.130
Yeah, I woke up because I felt

662
00:31:10.132 --> 00:31:11.999
my life was in danger
or something.


663
00:31:12.001 --> 00:31:13.834
<i>That's not far from the truth.</i>

664
00:31:13.836 --> 00:31:16.336
<i>- Shut up, Benny.
- What?</i>


665
00:31:16.338 --> 00:31:19.339
Hey, was this thing running
the whole time?


666
00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:20.874
<i>Yeah.</i>

667
00:31:20.876 --> 00:31:23.310
Oh, good. That means we can...

668
00:31:23.312 --> 00:31:25.813
<i>It is now officially day two.</i>

669
00:31:25.815 --> 00:31:28.816
<i>And this morning
was a little awkward.</i>


670
00:31:28.818 --> 00:31:30.117
God, what time is it?

671
00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:33.220
Hm. It's, um, 7:30.

672
00:31:33.222 --> 00:31:36.290
I'd be sleeping if you guys
didn't tell me about last night.


673
00:31:36.292 --> 00:31:38.959
<i>- It scared the shit outta me.
- It was freaky.</i>


674
00:31:38.961 --> 00:31:40.861
<i>Everyone seems to be asleep
now, though.</i>


675
00:31:40.863 --> 00:31:44.398
Why don't you put that down
and grab yourself a bowl?


676
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.300
<i>I'm good.
I never eat breakfast.</i>


677
00:31:46.302 --> 00:31:48.936
You're gonna bitch to me
I didn't let you eat.


678
00:31:48.938 --> 00:31:51.205
Are you seriously filming us
when we're eating cereal?


679
00:31:51.207 --> 00:31:53.440
<i>Yeah. You never know
what you're gonna get.</i>


680
00:31:53.442 --> 00:31:55.342
<i>Think of what we caught
last night.</i>


681
00:31:55.344 --> 00:31:57.845
Hm, that reminds me...

682
00:31:57.847 --> 00:31:59.246
First order of business today

683
00:31:59.248 --> 00:32:01.281
I wanna set up cameras
around the house.


684
00:32:01.283 --> 00:32:04.251
- You think Andrew'll be cool?
- Andrew's not gonna know.


685
00:32:04.253 --> 00:32:06.486
You're gonna patch those in
through your phone app.


686
00:32:06.488 --> 00:32:09.323
Also, I wanna try to get down
to that, uh...


687
00:32:09.325 --> 00:32:13.126
<i>- Oh. Carrie, are you okay?
- Hey, hey.</i>


688
00:32:13.128 --> 00:32:15.362
- Lean your head back.
- It's just a nosebleed.


689
00:32:15.364 --> 00:32:17.598
Can you put that down,
help for a second?


690
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.032
<i>- Yeah. Sorry.
- Do you wanna...</i>


691
00:32:19.034 --> 00:32:20.400
<i>Um, is the bag...</i>

692
00:32:20.402 --> 00:32:22.369
<i>Shall I get the bag
from upstairs?</i>


693
00:32:24.439 --> 00:32:27.441
Alright, uh,
all the cameras are set.


694
00:32:27.443 --> 00:32:29.276
Go and check,
see if they're working.


695
00:32:29.278 --> 00:32:32.279
<i>Yeah. Checking. 
Yeah, man.</i>

696
00:32:32.281 --> 00:32:35.015
<i>Cameras one, two and three
are all set.</i>


697
00:32:36.118 --> 00:32:38.085
One second.

698
00:32:38.087 --> 00:32:39.586
Hey, Aaron, what's up?

699
00:32:41.189 --> 00:32:43.924
Yeah, yeah,
I can, I can do that right now.


700
00:32:43.926 --> 00:32:46.193
Okay, bye.

701
00:32:46.195 --> 00:32:48.528
Uh, Aaron wants to do
a video call, so...


702
00:32:53.369 --> 00:32:57.104
You were supposed to touch base
earlier. What's going on?


703
00:32:57.106 --> 00:32:59.406
Um, yeah,
I was just about to call you.


704
00:32:59.408 --> 00:33:01.375
- Where's Carrie?
- She's not feeling well.


705
00:33:01.377 --> 00:33:03.610
- So she's resting.
- How's everything else going?


706
00:33:05.346 --> 00:33:08.081
Well, at first,
they seemed kind of ordinary.


707
00:33:08.083 --> 00:33:09.650
You haven't seen
anything strange?


708
00:33:12.186 --> 00:33:15.289
I'm still not completely sold
on the whole vampire thing.


709
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:17.157
Yeah,
that's what I thought at first


710
00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:20.427
but now we've seen
a couple of strange things.


711
00:33:20.429 --> 00:33:23.263
One of the family members
came into our room this morning


712
00:33:23.265 --> 00:33:26.533
and he was sniffing Carrie.

713
00:33:26.535 --> 00:33:28.435
Sniffing Carrie?

714
00:33:30.705 --> 00:33:32.472
That doesn't mean he's a vampire

715
00:33:32.474 --> 00:33:34.308
that just means he's a pervert!

716
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.943
I'm not ready to leave yet.

717
00:33:35.945 --> 00:33:37.711
I think
there's something off about...


718
00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:40.113
Benny, why the hell
are you filming this?


719
00:33:40.115 --> 00:33:43.083
Just try and make an effort

720
00:33:43.085 --> 00:33:46.053
to come up with
something newsworthy, please.


721
00:33:46.055 --> 00:33:47.587
- Will do.
- Thank you.


722
00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:51.658
Bye.

723
00:33:53.461 --> 00:33:56.096
<i>So what do you think?</i>

724
00:33:56.098 --> 00:33:59.232
Well, for starters I-I think
we should be sleeping during


725
00:33:59.234 --> 00:34:02.536
the daytime so that we can be
awake at night when they are.


726
00:34:02.538 --> 00:34:04.204
<i>Considering what happened
this morning</i>


727
00:34:04.206 --> 00:34:06.039
<i>and the fact
we got little sleep.</i>


728
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:07.541
<i>- I'm going back to bed.
- Yeah.</i>


729
00:34:07.543 --> 00:34:10.043
Hey, guys. Ho!

730
00:34:10.045 --> 00:34:12.412
I scared the shit outta him.
Did you see?


731
00:34:12.414 --> 00:34:15.682
No, it just felt like you were
supposed to be, well, you know?


732
00:34:15.684 --> 00:34:17.517
Oh, because it's daytime?
No, no, no.


733
00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.987
I built up a resistance
to indirect sunlight


734
00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.222
but I did hear
what the bossman was talking.


735
00:34:22.224 --> 00:34:24.057
Sounds like
he's skeptical of us, huh?


736
00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:26.293
I think it's difficult
for Aaron because he's not...


737
00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:29.363
Okay, no, no, no, cool, 'cause
I wanna show you guys somethin'.


738
00:34:29.365 --> 00:34:31.431
Come over here. Come on.

739
00:34:31.433 --> 00:34:33.567
Okay. Now are you ready?

740
00:34:33.569 --> 00:34:36.503
'Cause this is gonna
blow your mind, okay?


741
00:34:36.505 --> 00:34:38.271
<i>- This thing's recording?
- Yeah. It's on.</i>


742
00:34:38.273 --> 00:34:41.375
Come here, come here.
Focus on my arm. Okay?


743
00:34:41.377 --> 00:34:43.410
Alright. Here goes nothin'.

744
00:34:45.246 --> 00:34:48.081
Oh! Whoo-hoo!

745
00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:49.316
<i>Gettin' it. 
Gettin' it.</i>

746
00:34:49.318 --> 00:34:50.550
Oh.

747
00:34:52.387 --> 00:34:55.655
Check that out.
Oh, crispy fried arm.


748
00:34:55.657 --> 00:34:57.290
Go ahead and touch it, bossman.

749
00:34:59.293 --> 00:35:01.261
- Oh!
- It's cold.


750
00:35:01.263 --> 00:35:02.796
Yeah, it's kinda trip, huh?

751
00:35:02.798 --> 00:35:05.032
Uh, did you get that?
You wanna try?


752
00:35:05.034 --> 00:35:07.067
<i>- I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay, but you got it.</i>


753
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:08.535
<i>- You got it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>


754
00:35:08.537 --> 00:35:10.604
Okay. Cool.

755
00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:12.773
Cool, well, um...
What do you guys think?


756
00:35:12.775 --> 00:35:15.642
You wanna do another interview?
'Cause we got this now.


757
00:35:15.644 --> 00:35:19.413
Ah, w-we'll do a second round
throughout the week, so...


758
00:35:19.415 --> 00:35:21.248
Okay, but you know,
everybody's asleep now.


759
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.417
I mean,
we can totally pop one off.


760
00:35:23.419 --> 00:35:26.119
Yeah, um, we-we have to properly
set up the equipment


761
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:27.421
script out some more questions

762
00:35:27.423 --> 00:35:29.356
so we're kinda not ready.

763
00:35:29.358 --> 00:35:32.059
Okay. Well, then, um...

764
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:33.693
I'll go get me some shut-eye.

765
00:35:33.695 --> 00:35:36.063
- Okay?
- Alright, sleep well.


766
00:35:36.065 --> 00:35:37.297
What do you guys think?

767
00:35:37.299 --> 00:35:38.498
You think this-this footage

768
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.133
is interesting enough
for your bossman?


769
00:35:40.135 --> 00:35:42.569
I don't want you guys
to leave yet, you know?


770
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:45.172
Ah, absolutely.

771
00:35:45.174 --> 00:35:47.207
- You're sure?
- Yeah.


772
00:35:47.209 --> 00:35:49.776
Alright. Cool, cool.

773
00:35:49.778 --> 00:35:51.344
Well, uh, I'm out.

774
00:35:51.346 --> 00:35:53.346
<i>Have a good one.</i>

775
00:35:54.749 --> 00:35:56.550
Peace out.

776
00:35:59.654 --> 00:36:01.288
Oh, my God! You believe that?

777
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.323
<i>This footage
is gonna be amazing.</i>


778
00:36:03.325 --> 00:36:04.658
You better have captured that.

779
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.526
<i>Trust me, I got it.</i>

780
00:36:06.528 --> 00:36:09.529
<i>What was he doing up anyway?</i>

781
00:36:09.531 --> 00:36:11.364
I don't know,
we know they're awake


782
00:36:11.366 --> 00:36:13.100
at night and during the day.

783
00:36:15.403 --> 00:36:18.238
<i>Guys, wake up.
It's almost 6:00.</i>


784
00:36:20.541 --> 00:36:23.443
Ah... Shit.
We slept a long fuckin' time.


785
00:36:23.445 --> 00:36:26.179
Benny, uh, why didn't you
get us up earlier?


786
00:36:26.181 --> 00:36:27.781
<i>Man, I dozed off.</i>

787
00:36:27.783 --> 00:36:30.183
Can't you do anything right?

788
00:36:30.185 --> 00:36:31.318
Carrie.

789
00:36:32.653 --> 00:36:34.688
Carrie, come on,
it's time to get up.


790
00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.858
Um, I don't feel good.

791
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.327
<i>Mike, what's wrong with her?</i>

792
00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:42.696
How the hell should I know?

793
00:36:42.698 --> 00:36:44.531
Hey, what's going on?

794
00:36:46.435 --> 00:36:48.735
<i>Dude, look at her.
She's all pale.</i>


795
00:36:48.737 --> 00:36:50.337
Yeah, she felt really cold.

796
00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:52.439
<i>Mike, check her neck
for bite marks.</i>


797
00:36:56.911 --> 00:37:00.614
No, no, there's nothing. Benny.

798
00:37:00.616 --> 00:37:04.284
Hey. Hey, how are you feelin'?

799
00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:06.620
Not fucking good, Mike.

800
00:37:06.622 --> 00:37:09.756
<i>Maybe I can find
some aspirin downstairs.</i>


801
00:37:09.758 --> 00:37:11.658
Yeah, look, uh,
I'm coming with you


802
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.895
so that you won't give her
anything else fucked up.


803
00:37:14.897 --> 00:37:17.330
<i>You know,
I can do some things right.</i>


804
00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:32.712
You wanna put down that camera

805
00:37:32.714 --> 00:37:34.748
and help me look for medicine
for Carrie?


806
00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:38.618
<i>- Good evening.
- Ah.</i>


807
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.453
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.


808
00:37:40.455 --> 00:37:43.490
No, it's just fright.
You just took us by surprise.


809
00:37:43.492 --> 00:37:45.959
<i>- Evening, Benny.
- Hi, Elle.</i>


810
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:47.627
Anything I can help you find?

811
00:37:47.629 --> 00:37:49.863
We're just trying
to find some aspirin for Carrie.


812
00:37:49.865 --> 00:37:52.799
- She's not feeling so well.
- Oh, sorry to hear.


813
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:54.634
Uh, let me see what we have.

814
00:37:57.271 --> 00:37:58.972
<i>- Good evening, fellas.
- Good evening.</i>


815
00:37:58.974 --> 00:38:01.908
Andrew dear, Mike says
Carrie isn't feeling so good.


816
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:03.543
- No, no.
- Ah.


817
00:38:03.545 --> 00:38:05.612
Do you know
if we have any aspirin?


818
00:38:05.614 --> 00:38:07.847
I don't know.
Look in the medicine cabinet.


819
00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:10.717
Mm-hmm. Oh!

820
00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:13.320
- Not much use for it.
- Here we are.


821
00:38:13.322 --> 00:38:15.755
Oh, here it is. Thank you.

822
00:38:15.757 --> 00:38:18.258
She finds everything.

823
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.559
Did you guys sleep well?

824
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:21.828
Actually, yeah, we slept fine.

825
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.830
- Glad to hear.
- You know, I can't...


826
00:38:23.832 --> 00:38:25.532
I've got to tell you that

827
00:38:25.534 --> 00:38:28.902
we are expecting, uh,
additional guests later tonight.


828
00:38:28.904 --> 00:38:31.671
Oh, I-I didn't know that
anyone else was, was coming.


829
00:38:31.673 --> 00:38:34.808
Yeah, it's our sectional leader.

830
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.409
He's paying us a visit.

831
00:38:36.411 --> 00:38:38.845
It's actually considered
quite an honor.


832
00:38:38.847 --> 00:38:41.281
I'd ask you
to be on your best behavior.


833
00:38:41.283 --> 00:38:43.250
Yeah, yeah, of course.

834
00:38:43.252 --> 00:38:45.952
And he'd also, he'd like to
contribute to the documentary.


835
00:38:45.954 --> 00:38:47.587
Oh. Well, great.

836
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:50.590
I- I'm sure we'll get
some, some great footage.


837
00:38:50.592 --> 00:38:54.027
I- I should probably get this up
to Carrie, so thank you.


838
00:38:54.029 --> 00:38:55.528
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh.


839
00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.364
Dinner'll be ready
in half an hour.


840
00:38:57.366 --> 00:38:59.566
<i>- Cool. Thanks.
- Great, we-we'll see you then.</i>


841
00:38:59.568 --> 00:39:01.034
Thank you...

842
00:39:03.704 --> 00:39:06.706
Benny, if you don't shut
that camera off right now...


843
00:39:06.708 --> 00:39:10.410
<i>Mike, someone's at the door.</i>

844
00:39:10.412 --> 00:39:12.846
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.


845
00:39:12.848 --> 00:39:15.482
So Andrew wanted me to let you
know Samuel's here.


846
00:39:15.484 --> 00:39:17.717
Oh, uh, we'll be right down.

847
00:39:17.719 --> 00:39:19.953
- Okay.
- Cool.


848
00:39:20.755 --> 00:39:21.955
Okay.

849
00:39:26.494 --> 00:39:28.395
<i>- Alright, let's go do this.
- Wait.</i>


850
00:39:28.397 --> 00:39:30.997
<i>You have your micro cam on?</i>

851
00:39:30.999 --> 00:39:32.599
Yup. All set.

852
00:39:40.441 --> 00:39:44.411
Gentlemen, this is Samuel.

853
00:39:44.413 --> 00:39:47.347
Our sectional group leader.

854
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:49.516
The one I told you
was coming tonight.


855
00:39:49.518 --> 00:39:51.584
Sam. Nice to meet you.
I'm Mike.


856
00:39:51.586 --> 00:39:52.886
Samuel, please.

857
00:39:52.888 --> 00:39:55.522
Yes, of course, uh, Samuel.
I'm sorry.


858
00:39:55.524 --> 00:39:57.557
So you're the one
that broke the story


859
00:39:57.559 --> 00:39:59.693
about the blood donation
facilities?


860
00:39:59.695 --> 00:40:03.596
Yes, I happened to,
to stumble upon that.


861
00:40:03.598 --> 00:40:07.667
I see. Well, you should know.
I requested you personally.


862
00:40:07.669 --> 00:40:10.970
I wanted to see if you are
as good as your reputation.


863
00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:12.972
Oh, I guess we'll find out.

864
00:40:12.974 --> 00:40:15.575
Oh, this is Benny.
He's operating the camera.


865
00:40:15.577 --> 00:40:16.976
<i>- Benny.
- Hi there.</i>


866
00:40:16.978 --> 00:40:20.413
Come on, gentlemen.
We're gonna leave you ladies.


867
00:40:20.415 --> 00:40:23.683
We have to pre, continue to
prepare for tonight's ceremony.


868
00:40:23.685 --> 00:40:27.687
- Samuel.
- Thank you, Andrew.


869
00:40:27.689 --> 00:40:30.390
Um, this is my daughter,
Rebecca.


870
00:40:30.392 --> 00:40:33.493
Oh, Rebecca. Nice to meet you.

871
00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:34.794
Come.

872
00:40:34.796 --> 00:40:36.596
<i>Hi. Nice to meet you.</i>

873
00:40:36.598 --> 00:40:40.400
And this is my other daughter,
Sybil.


874
00:40:40.402 --> 00:40:43.636
Sybil, it's a pleasure
to meet you, as well.


875
00:40:43.638 --> 00:40:44.871
How dare you address me?

876
00:40:44.873 --> 00:40:47.807
- You're nothing more than prey.
- Sybil.


877
00:40:47.809 --> 00:40:50.477
We feed on pitiful bloodsacks
like you. Nothing more.


878
00:41:04.125 --> 00:41:05.925
I apologize
for my daughter's behavior.


879
00:41:05.927 --> 00:41:08.995
She is still adjusting
to the changing times.


880
00:41:08.997 --> 00:41:10.764
Yeah, it's okay.

881
00:41:12.533 --> 00:41:14.901
You know... kids.

882
00:41:20.908 --> 00:41:25.545
Can you tell us a brief history
about yourself?


883
00:41:25.547 --> 00:41:28.882
Okay, I, uh...

884
00:41:28.884 --> 00:41:30.950
I was raised in England

885
00:41:30.952 --> 00:41:34.821
and I came over to the States
in the early 17th century.


886
00:41:34.823 --> 00:41:36.556
How did you become a vampire?

887
00:41:38.659 --> 00:41:41.594
Direct into the point, I see.

888
00:41:41.596 --> 00:41:44.564
I was turned by an elder.

889
00:41:44.566 --> 00:41:47.000
If an elder were to die

890
00:41:47.002 --> 00:41:49.502
would you be affected by that?

891
00:41:51.439 --> 00:41:53.640
Well, since we're all connected

892
00:41:53.642 --> 00:41:58.011
um, we would feel
tremendous physical pain. Yes.


893
00:41:58.013 --> 00:42:01.514
- Would you change back?
- No.


894
00:42:01.516 --> 00:42:05.218
No, no, once the virus is in
your bloodstream, it's there.


895
00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.454
There's no way to get rid of it.

896
00:42:09.657 --> 00:42:12.058
Do you know
how vampirism came to be?


897
00:42:14.628 --> 00:42:18.565
That's like asking
how fish came to be.


898
00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:20.533
When I discovered
that blood-donation facilities


899
00:42:20.535 --> 00:42:22.569
were supplying vampires
with their sustenance


900
00:42:22.571 --> 00:42:26.206
it seemed that you had adapted
to new ways.


901
00:42:26.208 --> 00:42:30.176
We have adapted to modern times
and technologies.


902
00:42:30.178 --> 00:42:33.112
It's not typical for us to, uh

903
00:42:33.114 --> 00:42:36.015
go on killing people anymore.

904
00:42:36.017 --> 00:42:37.584
But you used to kill.

905
00:42:39.854 --> 00:42:42.856
Yes, and that was, uh,
unfortunately


906
00:42:42.858 --> 00:42:45.758
part of our history.

907
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.628
How... did you kill?

908
00:42:50.865 --> 00:42:53.700
Whichever was the quickest way
to draw the blood.


909
00:42:53.702 --> 00:42:56.202
Being human,
you wouldn't know about that.


910
00:42:56.204 --> 00:43:00.173
The pain and the hunger
when we have a need to feed.


911
00:43:00.175 --> 00:43:02.041
That's, uh...

912
00:43:03.777 --> 00:43:06.112
It's as if nothing else matters.

913
00:43:06.114 --> 00:43:08.681
It sounds like an addiction.

914
00:43:08.683 --> 00:43:11.684
Hm, of the worst kind.

915
00:43:11.686 --> 00:43:14.220
But as I stated earlier,
we've evolved.


916
00:43:14.222 --> 00:43:17.257
We, uh, we've learned,
over the centuries


917
00:43:17.259 --> 00:43:19.292
to control these urges.

918
00:43:22.796 --> 00:43:25.698
We don't have any hatred
of humans.


919
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.601
We're trying to help society
by doing it a service.


920
00:43:30.004 --> 00:43:32.105
How so?

921
00:43:32.107 --> 00:43:35.808
I think it's better if
I show you rather than explain


922
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.044
but you're gonna need
to turn the cameras off.


923
00:43:42.883 --> 00:43:45.184
Listen, if you wanna see...

924
00:43:45.186 --> 00:43:47.287
you're gonna need
to turn them off.


925
00:43:56.864 --> 00:43:59.132
Well, go ahead.

926
00:43:59.134 --> 00:44:01.100
Alright, shut 'em down.

927
00:44:01.102 --> 00:44:03.036
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna fuck you guys.</i>

928
00:44:08.843 --> 00:44:11.778
Ah! No, let go!

929
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.012
This way, gentleman.

930
00:44:13.014 --> 00:44:16.115
Michael. Benny.

931
00:44:16.117 --> 00:44:17.584
You two stand over there.

932
00:44:19.688 --> 00:44:20.920
<i>Wait.</i>

933
00:44:22.222 --> 00:44:25.925
O- okay, um...
What's going on?


934
00:44:25.927 --> 00:44:27.360
Relax, Michael.

935
00:44:27.362 --> 00:44:28.928
Are you gonna kill her?

936
00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.797
We're sacrificing her.

937
00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:32.231
But then you said
you're domesticated


938
00:44:32.233 --> 00:44:33.900
and that you don't kill anymore.

939
00:44:33.902 --> 00:44:37.704
We are domesticated.
She, however, is not.


940
00:44:37.706 --> 00:44:40.840
Well, tonight
we are going to celebrate


941
00:44:40.842 --> 00:44:43.676
our origins in the old way.

942
00:44:43.678 --> 00:44:45.144
We do this ritual yearly

943
00:44:45.146 --> 00:44:48.147
so we don't have to go out
and kill every night.


944
00:44:48.149 --> 00:44:50.283
<i>But how does this help society?</i>

945
00:44:50.285 --> 00:44:52.352
Before you start to pity her
too much


946
00:44:52.354 --> 00:44:54.387
you should know
that she is a prostitute


947
00:44:54.389 --> 00:44:56.623
and infected with HIV

948
00:44:56.625 --> 00:44:58.791
who's been
knowingly infecting others


949
00:44:58.793 --> 00:45:00.760
while satiating the drug use.

950
00:45:00.762 --> 00:45:02.729
- That's not true!
- Shh!


951
00:45:02.731 --> 00:45:04.197
Please don't let them kill me!

952
00:45:04.199 --> 00:45:06.232
We're very selective
about who we choose


953
00:45:06.234 --> 00:45:08.368
to participate
in our ceremonies.


954
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.070
No families or children.

955
00:45:11.072 --> 00:45:12.705
She'll be dead within a year

956
00:45:12.707 --> 00:45:14.641
if left on the streets,
cold, hungry


957
00:45:14.643 --> 00:45:16.142
sick and, uh...

958
00:45:16.144 --> 00:45:17.644
It's an ancient ritual

959
00:45:17.646 --> 00:45:20.813
and no humans
have ever witnessed this before.


960
00:45:20.815 --> 00:45:22.649
Why don't you want us
filming it?


961
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:24.884
But we don't think
that the general public's ready


962
00:45:24.886 --> 00:45:28.721
to watch this
particular ceremony, Michael.


963
00:45:28.723 --> 00:45:30.356
Well, shall we begin?

964
00:45:30.358 --> 00:45:33.126
My dear,
would you do the honors?


965
00:45:33.128 --> 00:45:35.294
No! No! No!

966
00:45:35.296 --> 00:45:36.663
<i>- Ah!
- Holy shit!</i>


967
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.869
Why are you just watching?
Please, help me!


968
00:45:42.871 --> 00:45:45.171
Andrew.

969
00:45:45.173 --> 00:45:47.874
No, no! Ah!

970
00:45:52.046 --> 00:45:54.013
<i>It will be over soon.</i>

971
00:45:54.015 --> 00:45:56.249
Shh!

972
00:45:56.251 --> 00:45:59.318
<i>Shouldn't we use a tranquilizer
to help her with the pain?</i>


973
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.688
No, foreign chemical
in her bloodstream


974
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.790
will ruin the ceremony.

975
00:46:03.792 --> 00:46:07.093
- Please, everyone, join in.
- No! No!


976
00:46:07.095 --> 00:46:10.163
No! No! Ah!

977
00:46:14.234 --> 00:46:16.469
Oh, my God! Ah!

978
00:46:21.375 --> 00:46:23.943
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

979
00:46:23.945 --> 00:46:27.447
Please! I beg you.

980
00:46:27.449 --> 00:46:29.415
Just do something.

981
00:46:30.484 --> 00:46:32.485
<i>- Please!
- Mike!</i>


982
00:46:32.487 --> 00:46:36.189
<i>Mike, we have to, we gotta go.
We can't film this.</i>


983
00:46:43.497 --> 00:46:47.133
Oh. Congratulations.

984
00:46:47.135 --> 00:46:49.302
For another fine ceremony.

985
00:46:51.171 --> 00:46:53.439
This may seem monstrous to you

986
00:46:53.441 --> 00:46:55.208
but trust me

987
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.844
we do this to help society

988
00:46:57.846 --> 00:47:00.480
by removing the unwanted.

989
00:47:04.251 --> 00:47:07.286
Right.

990
00:47:07.288 --> 00:47:10.757
<i>Why the fuck didn't we do
anything to help that girl?</i>


991
00:47:10.759 --> 00:47:12.391
What do you think
we could've done?


992
00:47:12.393 --> 00:47:14.360
<i>We could've done something!
Anything!</i>


993
00:47:14.362 --> 00:47:16.462
<i>We're just as guilty
as those people!</i>


994
00:47:18.332 --> 00:47:20.233
This is the problem
dealing with inexperienced...


995
00:47:20.235 --> 00:47:22.135
<i>Oh, don't give me
that bullshit, man!</i>


996
00:47:22.137 --> 00:47:23.970
<i>We just watched a girl
get murdered</i>


997
00:47:23.972 --> 00:47:26.105
<i>while we sat around
and watched!</i>


998
00:47:26.107 --> 00:47:28.141
Would you shut up,
think for a second?


999
00:47:28.143 --> 00:47:29.442
What'd you think
would've happened


1000
00:47:29.444 --> 00:47:30.910
if we tried to interfere?

1001
00:47:30.912 --> 00:47:32.545
You think
they would've let us live?


1002
00:47:32.547 --> 00:47:34.781
<i>So you're saying
there's nothing we can do.</i>


1003
00:47:34.783 --> 00:47:36.015
<i>We're gonna watch them kill.</i>

1004
00:47:36.017 --> 00:47:38.484
We are doing something.

1005
00:47:38.486 --> 00:47:41.020
We're letting people know
what's going on here.


1006
00:47:41.022 --> 00:47:43.122
<i>So why aren't we
getting out of here?</i>


1007
00:47:43.124 --> 00:47:46.292
<i>- What about our safety?
- Don't you get it?</i>


1008
00:47:46.294 --> 00:47:49.929
We're gonna let people know
what these things really are.


1009
00:47:49.931 --> 00:47:51.497
I mean, yeah, look.

1010
00:47:51.499 --> 00:47:54.267
Fine, okay, we couldn't save one

1011
00:47:54.269 --> 00:47:56.302
we're gonna save more
in the long run.


1012
00:47:56.304 --> 00:47:58.337
What good's it gonna do
if you're dead


1013
00:47:58.339 --> 00:48:00.139
you can't tell anyone?

1014
00:48:00.141 --> 00:48:01.440
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

1015
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:07.346
<i>Do you believe what
they were saying about her?</i>


1016
00:48:07.348 --> 00:48:10.283
I don't, I don't know.

1017
00:48:10.285 --> 00:48:11.584
But it's dark.

1018
00:48:15.155 --> 00:48:17.390
The only thing
that matters now is, is


1019
00:48:17.392 --> 00:48:20.393
I've to make sure
the three of us get home safely.


1020
00:48:20.395 --> 00:48:22.461
<i>- Okay?
- Is she doing any better?</i>


1021
00:48:22.463 --> 00:48:26.165
How the fuck should I know? I
mean, does she look any better?


1022
00:48:33.407 --> 00:48:34.607
<i>What?</i>

1023
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:36.909
<i>Are those Samuel's daughters?</i>

1024
00:48:36.911 --> 00:48:38.911
<i>Hey, Mike. Check this out.</i>

1025
00:48:38.913 --> 00:48:40.546
<i>- Wait, what? What is it?
- Shh, shh...</i>


1026
00:48:40.548 --> 00:48:42.315
<i>Down there at the pool.</i>

1027
00:48:46.353 --> 00:48:48.221
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1028
00:48:48.223 --> 00:48:50.623
<i>Aren't they supposed
to be sisters?</i>


1029
00:48:50.625 --> 00:48:52.124
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

1030
00:48:55.629 --> 00:48:58.531
This whole friggin' family
is weird.


1031
00:49:12.613 --> 00:49:15.514
- Hey, guys. Bad time?
- No.


1032
00:49:17.517 --> 00:49:20.586
So did the little ritual
freak you guys out or what?


1033
00:49:20.588 --> 00:49:23.256
No, not really.

1034
00:49:23.258 --> 00:49:26.659
<i>- How about you, Benny?
- No. No bother at all.</i>


1035
00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:28.594
Cool, man. Cool.

1036
00:49:28.596 --> 00:49:31.664
So everybody's downstairs,
started figuring


1037
00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:34.166
maybe you guys wanna come
with Selvin and I


1038
00:49:34.168 --> 00:49:35.601
to document the night and stuff.

1039
00:49:35.603 --> 00:49:38.070
- You game?
- Sure. Why not?


1040
00:49:38.072 --> 00:49:41.374
- What do you think, Benny?
- Sure.


1041
00:49:41.376 --> 00:49:44.644
Awesome! Oh, man,
this is gonna be so much fun.


1042
00:49:44.646 --> 00:49:46.646
But we can't tell Andrew.

1043
00:49:46.648 --> 00:49:48.681
Okay? We've to keep it
behind his backs.


1044
00:49:48.683 --> 00:49:50.683
They're busy downstairs
with Samuel whatever


1045
00:49:50.685 --> 00:49:53.085
let's sneak out
the back quietly.


1046
00:49:53.087 --> 00:49:55.121
Man, this is gonna be
so much fun.


1047
00:49:55.123 --> 00:49:57.523
You're gonna get so much
kick-ass footage. Trust me.


1048
00:49:57.525 --> 00:50:01.193
Trust me. Just...
You can trust me.


1049
00:50:01.195 --> 00:50:02.962
Alright, let's rock and roll.

1050
00:50:02.964 --> 00:50:05.264
Oh!

1051
00:50:05.266 --> 00:50:08.200
- How's your girl doing?
- Ah, she's better, I think.


1052
00:50:11.171 --> 00:50:12.638
Right on.

1053
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.473
Selvin, get your ass in here.

1054
00:50:18.412 --> 00:50:20.646
Ah, we're ready to go, so...

1055
00:50:20.648 --> 00:50:22.415
- Let's go.
- Ho!


1056
00:50:22.417 --> 00:50:24.283
- We're not going that way.
- We're not?


1057
00:50:24.285 --> 00:50:27.086
- No.
- Wait. What's going on?


1058
00:50:27.088 --> 00:50:29.221
Grab Benny. I got Mike.

1059
00:50:29.223 --> 00:50:32.525
Ah!

1060
00:50:32.527 --> 00:50:34.260
Oh, no!

1061
00:50:36.563 --> 00:50:38.698
I was just fucking with you.

1062
00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.167
You thought we could fly?

1063
00:50:41.169 --> 00:50:43.569
You've seen too many movies,
Mikey.


1064
00:50:43.571 --> 00:50:46.038
Come on, we're gonna take
the back staircase.


1065
00:50:55.216 --> 00:50:57.316
Oh! You, did you...

1066
00:50:57.318 --> 00:50:59.652
Did you wet?
You should've seen your face.


1067
00:50:59.654 --> 00:51:01.520
Alright, listen, listen.
The lights burn out.


1068
00:51:01.522 --> 00:51:03.522
So make sure
you watch your step.


1069
00:51:12.566 --> 00:51:14.767
Shh!

1070
00:51:14.769 --> 00:51:17.603
- Quiet.
- Hey, Benny, watch your step.


1071
00:51:17.605 --> 00:51:19.772
<i>Oh! Oh, geez...</i>

1072
00:51:22.409 --> 00:51:24.076
Quick. Quick.

1073
00:51:31.051 --> 00:51:32.451
Come on. Come on.

1074
00:51:40.227 --> 00:51:41.494
Let's go!

1075
00:51:45.365 --> 00:51:47.566
So that girl
that was sacrificed today


1076
00:51:47.568 --> 00:51:50.169
was she actually sick?

1077
00:51:50.171 --> 00:51:53.072
Fuck, no. No, no, we found her
on the street tonight.


1078
00:51:53.074 --> 00:51:55.374
<i>- True story.
- I knew it.</i>


1079
00:51:55.376 --> 00:51:59.412
- So why weren't you there?
- Oh!


1080
00:51:59.414 --> 00:52:02.581
Listen, those guys
and the whole domesticated...


1081
00:52:02.583 --> 00:52:05.284
Andrew trying to be domestic,
fuck that. Losing his edge.


1082
00:52:05.286 --> 00:52:08.054
So you're saying that you
wanna continue killing, then?


1083
00:52:08.056 --> 00:52:11.323
Listen, what I'm saying is,
no offence


1084
00:52:11.325 --> 00:52:13.793
but I want humans to fear us

1085
00:52:13.795 --> 00:52:17.296
because if they fear us,
then they respect us.


1086
00:52:18.365 --> 00:52:19.598
Come on!

1087
00:52:24.104 --> 00:52:26.138
This is so much fun.

1088
00:52:28.608 --> 00:52:31.077
Hey, hey, come on,
get down, get down.


1089
00:52:31.079 --> 00:52:32.778
- See the house with the light?
- Yeah.


1090
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.281
- That's where we're going.
- Okay. Why?


1091
00:52:35.283 --> 00:52:37.750
Ah, well, it's a little bit
out of the way


1092
00:52:37.752 --> 00:52:39.819
and a bunch of stoners
live there.


1093
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:42.354
Oh, Selvin likes
one of the guys, too. So...


1094
00:52:42.356 --> 00:52:44.323
But why are we here?

1095
00:52:44.325 --> 00:52:46.192
Well, you wanna see how we live?

1096
00:52:46.194 --> 00:52:48.828
That's what I'm trying to show
you. Keep the camera rolling.


1097
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:51.097
Footage's gonna be amazing.
Come on. Come on.


1098
00:52:55.535 --> 00:52:57.403
Sneak around the back. Come on.

1099
00:53:02.576 --> 00:53:06.278
Okay, it's gonna be good. Shh!

1100
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.480
Go, go, go...

1101
00:53:11.184 --> 00:53:13.586
Make sure to keep the camera
on me, okay?


1102
00:53:13.588 --> 00:53:15.187
Follow closely.

1103
00:53:19.526 --> 00:53:21.327
Uh, but...

1104
00:53:21.329 --> 00:53:24.530
Okay. Make sure to keep
the camera on both of us.


1105
00:53:24.532 --> 00:53:26.599
<i>Uh, got it.</i>

1106
00:53:26.601 --> 00:53:28.134
<i>- Alright.
- Okay.</i>


1107
00:53:28.136 --> 00:53:29.435
It's showtime.

1108
00:53:46.153 --> 00:53:47.186
Got it.

1109
00:53:57.364 --> 00:53:58.564
<i>Yo!</i>

1110
00:54:00.233 --> 00:54:02.168
Let's grab some beers.

1111
00:54:07.641 --> 00:54:09.942
<i>- What are we doing?
- Shit, man!</i>


1112
00:54:13.647 --> 00:54:16.282
<i>- Benny! Benny!
- What?</i>


1113
00:54:16.284 --> 00:54:18.584
<i>- What?
- Oh, look.</i>


1114
00:54:18.586 --> 00:54:21.387
Okay. Now the rest
of the pinheads.


1115
00:54:21.389 --> 00:54:23.489
Stay behind us. Come on.

1116
00:54:36.771 --> 00:54:39.405
Excuse me, germs,
if I may please


1117
00:54:39.407 --> 00:54:41.307
have your undivided attention.

1118
00:54:41.309 --> 00:54:42.775
Oh!

1119
00:54:42.777 --> 00:54:44.643
You got ten seconds to get out

1120
00:54:44.645 --> 00:54:46.679
before I knock
the fuck out of you.


1121
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:48.280
Excuse me, you're interrupting!

1122
00:54:48.282 --> 00:54:52.384
Hey, Glen, go get
my fucking gun off the dresser.


1123
00:54:52.386 --> 00:54:55.621
Fucking now! Go!

1124
00:54:55.623 --> 00:54:58.257
Ooh, tough guy.
It's gonna be good.


1125
00:54:58.259 --> 00:55:00.826
Oh! He's got a knife.
You wanna stab...


1126
00:55:00.828 --> 00:55:03.996
You wanna stab me?
Okay, go ahead. Come on. Do it.


1127
00:55:03.998 --> 00:55:05.831
- Oh!
- Come on.


1128
00:55:05.833 --> 00:55:08.767
Did you just stab me?

1129
00:55:08.769 --> 00:55:11.503
You're gettin' this?
Is that, is that your best shot?


1130
00:55:11.505 --> 00:55:14.707
Come on, motherfucker! Come on!

1131
00:55:14.709 --> 00:55:17.876
I'm choking.
You wanna see something scary?


1132
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:26.652
<i>- Oh! Oh!
- That had to hurt.</i>


1133
00:55:27.354 --> 00:55:29.488
Hey!

1134
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:33.025
Get the fuck away from him.

1135
00:55:33.027 --> 00:55:35.527
I'm, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1136
00:55:35.529 --> 00:55:36.996
That's not gonna happen.

1137
00:55:38.733 --> 00:55:39.965
Did you just shoot me?

1138
00:55:42.303 --> 00:55:43.669
Get him! Get him!

1139
00:55:43.671 --> 00:55:45.271
One!

1140
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.607
<i>Two!</i>

1141
00:55:52.879 --> 00:55:54.913
I never get to make a wish!

1142
00:55:54.915 --> 00:55:57.383
Oh, Benny, you wanna see
what it looks like?


1143
00:55:57.385 --> 00:55:59.985
Blake, kill him, just do it
so he doesn't suffer.


1144
00:55:59.987 --> 00:56:03.822
I mean, his body is in shock.
He doesn't feel anything.


1145
00:56:03.824 --> 00:56:05.891
See? Oh, hey, you know what?

1146
00:56:05.893 --> 00:56:07.726
You wanna interview me
during the process?


1147
00:56:07.728 --> 00:56:09.395
Come here, come here, Benny.

1148
00:56:09.397 --> 00:56:11.330
Yes. Okay, wait.
Can you see everything?


1149
00:56:11.332 --> 00:56:12.865
<i>- Uh-huh.
- Okay, good.</i>


1150
00:56:12.867 --> 00:56:14.700
Ask me some questions.

1151
00:56:14.702 --> 00:56:16.935
Uh...

1152
00:56:16.937 --> 00:56:20.706
What-what goes through your mind
when you're killing people?


1153
00:56:20.708 --> 00:56:22.775
Pure adrenalin rush, man.

1154
00:56:22.777 --> 00:56:24.843
Hey, Selvin,
what are you feeling?


1155
00:56:27.981 --> 00:56:29.848
It feels nice.

1156
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.784
"It feels nice." There you go.

1157
00:56:31.786 --> 00:56:34.920
Uh, anything-anything else?

1158
00:56:34.922 --> 00:56:36.355
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1159
00:56:36.357 --> 00:56:39.892
One more question, okay?
Go ahead.


1160
00:56:39.894 --> 00:56:43.662
Why do you kill since blood
is readily available to you?


1161
00:56:43.664 --> 00:56:45.998
Ooh, that's a good question.

1162
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.535
Um, the hunt.
Yes, we really enjoy the hunt.


1163
00:56:49.537 --> 00:56:51.370
That's the part that's human,
you know?


1164
00:56:51.372 --> 00:56:53.706
We don't want our food
just given to us


1165
00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:56.075
like we're a bunch
of caged animals, you know?


1166
00:57:10.824 --> 00:57:14.026
- Alright, we're here. Come on.
- Ah...


1167
00:57:14.028 --> 00:57:17.029
Oh! Tonight was fun, right?
It's good.


1168
00:57:17.031 --> 00:57:21.567
Hey, but you know, you gotta
keep this between us. Okay?


1169
00:57:21.569 --> 00:57:24.770
Everyone is gonna find out
when we release the footage.


1170
00:57:27.774 --> 00:57:28.807
Oh.

1171
00:57:30.377 --> 00:57:33.512
Good. I hope it shocks
the shit out of 'em.


1172
00:57:33.514 --> 00:57:37.449
I mean, fuck Andrew and his
politically correct bullshit.


1173
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:40.419
I had a lot of fun.
Come on, let's go.


1174
00:57:42.756 --> 00:57:44.790
Selvin, come on.

1175
00:57:54.768 --> 00:57:56.635
<i>So we got the footage.</i>

1176
00:57:56.637 --> 00:57:58.504
<i>Why the hell
aren't we leaving yet?</i>


1177
00:57:58.506 --> 00:58:00.606
<i>How much more
do we have to get...</i>


1178
00:58:00.608 --> 00:58:02.908
What's going on over there?
Zoom in.


1179
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:04.743
<i>Fine.</i>

1180
00:58:04.745 --> 00:58:07.813
<i>Samuel and Elleanor.</i>

1181
00:58:07.815 --> 00:58:11.016
<i>Good talking, Mike. Glad
our lives means so much to you.</i>


1182
00:58:11.018 --> 00:58:14.019
<i>Wait. Where is Andrew?</i>

1183
00:58:14.021 --> 00:58:16.889
<i>And you're totally ignoring me.</i>

1184
00:58:18.425 --> 00:58:19.892
Well, turn on the audio.

1185
00:58:22.996 --> 00:58:26.498
I'll never forget you and you'll
be a part of me forever


1186
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.435
but it's best
if I stay with Andrew.


1187
00:58:29.437 --> 00:58:31.804
I worry about you, so...

1188
00:58:31.806 --> 00:58:33.906
And I don't believe
that Andrew could provide


1189
00:58:33.908 --> 00:58:35.941
the protection that you need.

1190
00:58:35.943 --> 00:58:38.444
And I don't trust
this film crew.


1191
00:58:38.446 --> 00:58:40.746
You worry too much, Samuel.

1192
00:58:40.748 --> 00:58:42.681
I've it under control
and you forget


1193
00:58:42.683 --> 00:58:44.950
how long I've been
looking after myself.


1194
00:58:47.053 --> 00:58:49.521
I can't let any harm
come your way.


1195
00:58:52.225 --> 00:58:55.194
I will always be yours.

1196
00:58:55.196 --> 00:58:57.563
You were always
such a romantic.


1197
00:59:00.066 --> 00:59:02.067
Goodnight, dear Samuel.

1198
00:59:04.804 --> 00:59:06.038
Goodnight, my dear.

1199
00:59:14.647 --> 00:59:17.950
<i>Seems like some sort of
a love triangle or something.</i>


1200
00:59:17.952 --> 00:59:19.751
Yeah, I guess.

1201
00:59:19.753 --> 00:59:22.254
Um, let's see what's going on
on the other cameras.


1202
00:59:27.093 --> 00:59:28.927
Blake, what the hell
were you thinking?


1203
00:59:28.929 --> 00:59:31.797
I don't see
what the big deal is.


1204
00:59:31.799 --> 00:59:33.932
I mean, everybody needs to know
we're vampires.


1205
00:59:33.934 --> 00:59:35.901
No, they don't know!

1206
00:59:35.903 --> 00:59:38.837
They do not know!

1207
00:59:38.839 --> 00:59:41.173
And you have to sabotage
our plan to make...


1208
00:59:41.175 --> 00:59:44.076
What? What? What?
That we're all domesticated?


1209
00:59:44.078 --> 00:59:46.512
This was to take us home
for the holidays?


1210
00:59:46.514 --> 00:59:48.981
Come on.
They're just food to us, man.


1211
00:59:48.983 --> 00:59:52.818
I mean, I'm sick of this whole
masquerade we're ordinary folks.


1212
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.653
It's not cutting it for me,
Andrew.


1213
00:59:54.655 --> 00:59:56.688
How are we supposed
to easily overtake them


1214
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:59.157
if they know we're their
enemies? You need to think.


1215
00:59:59.159 --> 01:00:01.960
You have just taken away
our advantage!


1216
01:00:01.962 --> 01:00:05.931
Okay. Okay.
So then what do you wanna do?


1217
01:00:05.933 --> 01:00:08.200
You know exactly
what you need to do now.


1218
01:00:10.003 --> 01:00:11.236
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1219
01:00:12.105 --> 01:00:14.206
<i>What do we do?</i>

1220
01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:15.741
We're getting out of here.

1221
01:00:15.743 --> 01:00:17.209
<i>- Now.
- It's about fucking time.</i>


1222
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:19.044
<i>I know
you like to get footage...</i>


1223
01:00:25.218 --> 01:00:26.652
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

1224
01:00:26.654 --> 01:00:29.187
Um, we've prepared
a late dinner for you.


1225
01:00:29.189 --> 01:00:32.157
Oh, well,
we're not hungry, so thank...


1226
01:00:32.159 --> 01:00:34.793
Andrew would actually
like to have a word with you.


1227
01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:37.262
And he's requested that
you don't bring any cameras.


1228
01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:42.267
Okay. Uh, we'll be right down.

1229
01:00:42.269 --> 01:00:44.736
Good.
We'll be expecting you shortly.


1230
01:00:46.906 --> 01:00:48.774
<i>We can't go down there, Mike.</i>

1231
01:00:48.776 --> 01:00:50.208
If we don't go down there

1232
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.044
they're gonna know
we're on to them.


1233
01:00:52.046 --> 01:00:53.579
<i>If we do, we're dead.</i>

1234
01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:56.248
Just film this
on your microcam, alright?


1235
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.916
Put this camera down.

1236
01:00:59.152 --> 01:01:02.721
Okay. Try to be
as relaxed as possible.


1237
01:01:02.723 --> 01:01:04.890
Okay, we can't act scared

1238
01:01:04.892 --> 01:01:07.192
or act like
we know something's up.


1239
01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:19.037
Ah. There they are.

1240
01:01:19.039 --> 01:01:23.308
- Come in. Sit.
- Thank you.


1241
01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:24.743
Benny, you must feel naked

1242
01:01:24.745 --> 01:01:26.378
without a camera
around your neck.


1243
01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.313
<i>It does feel
a little strange.</i>


1244
01:01:28.315 --> 01:01:30.048
<i>Yeah, almost like I'm naked.</i>

1245
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:32.050
Wow, all this food.

1246
01:01:32.952 --> 01:01:34.653
What's the occasion?

1247
01:01:34.655 --> 01:01:36.088
Well, you, of course.

1248
01:01:37.724 --> 01:01:38.924
Please dig in.

1249
01:01:40.827 --> 01:01:42.828
So...

1250
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.796
you've been with us a while.

1251
01:01:44.798 --> 01:01:48.033
- Got enough footage?
- Uh...


1252
01:01:48.035 --> 01:01:50.402
Yeah, I think
we got a decent amount.


1253
01:01:50.404 --> 01:01:53.872
Um, you know,
as filmmakers, we...


1254
01:01:53.874 --> 01:01:56.375
we always try to get
as much footage as possible


1255
01:01:56.377 --> 01:01:59.044
you know, just so
we have more to cut with.


1256
01:01:59.046 --> 01:02:00.078
Mm.

1257
01:02:02.215 --> 01:02:05.417
So did that, uh

1258
01:02:05.419 --> 01:02:07.386
ceremonial ritual of ours, uh

1259
01:02:07.388 --> 01:02:09.421
did you find that disturbing?

1260
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.157
I've seen worse.

1261
01:02:12.159 --> 01:02:14.860
I visited the tribes in Africa

1262
01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:17.229
that practiced cannibalism.

1263
01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:19.865
So I've gotten very used
to seeing rituals


1264
01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:21.800
of different cultures.

1265
01:02:21.802 --> 01:02:23.368
I'm sure you have.

1266
01:02:24.337 --> 01:02:25.937
So what do you think?

1267
01:02:26.839 --> 01:02:29.107
I'm sorry? Uh, about what?

1268
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:30.776
What do you think of us?

1269
01:02:32.178 --> 01:02:34.279
Um, I think you're...

1270
01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:36.181
very similar to us.

1271
01:02:37.283 --> 01:02:39.685
Really? That's an improvement.

1272
01:02:39.687 --> 01:02:40.952
In what way?

1273
01:02:41.988 --> 01:02:43.722
Well, th-the two of you.

1274
01:02:43.724 --> 01:02:47.359
For instance,
your relationship seems...


1275
01:02:48.394 --> 01:02:50.162
just like any other couple.

1276
01:02:50.797 --> 01:02:53.165
I see.

1277
01:02:53.167 --> 01:02:56.334
And how do you think you'll
portray us in the documentary?


1278
01:02:56.336 --> 01:02:59.738
Uh, well, I have to take a look
at the footage first


1279
01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.041
and cut it together, but I think
you'll find it to your liking.


1280
01:03:03.043 --> 01:03:04.443
And does that footage include

1281
01:03:04.445 --> 01:03:07.946
uh, what you shot
with Selvin and Blake?


1282
01:03:09.115 --> 01:03:11.783
I
- I, we, when we got invited

1283
01:03:11.785 --> 01:03:14.052
to, uh, join them
earlier this evening


1284
01:03:14.054 --> 01:03:16.888
we had no idea
what they had in store for us.


1285
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:18.924
I've already spoken to Blake.

1286
01:03:18.926 --> 01:03:21.793
Blake knows that he will be
severely punished.


1287
01:03:21.795 --> 01:03:24.963
I mean, how would you think
that footage will make us look?


1288
01:03:24.965 --> 01:03:27.733
Well, if it's that important
to you, um


1289
01:03:27.735 --> 01:03:29.768
we could just give you
the storage cartridge


1290
01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:30.936
that we used tonight.

1291
01:03:30.938 --> 01:03:32.137
Mm-hmm.

1292
01:03:33.773 --> 01:03:37.008
I mean, uh,
you know, I could just


1293
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:40.378
go and find out which ones
we used and give them to you.


1294
01:03:42.915 --> 01:03:46.351
Benny, uh, can you help me find
which cards were used tonight?


1295
01:03:46.353 --> 01:03:48.320
<i>- Yeah.
- We-we'll be right back.</i>


1296
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:52.758
We'll be right here.

1297
01:03:56.763 --> 01:03:58.463
<i>Mike, what are you doing?</i>

1298
01:03:58.465 --> 01:04:00.966
<i>We're not gonna give them
those cards, are we?</i>


1299
01:04:02.902 --> 01:04:04.369
Of course not.

1300
01:04:04.371 --> 01:04:06.805
They would have killed us
right then and there.


1301
01:04:11.778 --> 01:04:14.012
Holy water.
We're getting out of here now.


1302
01:04:14.014 --> 01:04:16.047
<i>They said holy water
doesn't affect them.</i>


1303
01:04:16.049 --> 01:04:18.283
Yeah, well,
I don't believe a word they say.


1304
01:04:18.285 --> 01:04:20.352
<i>Dude, bullets won't work.</i>

1305
01:04:20.354 --> 01:04:22.187
They do
when they're dipped in silver.


1306
01:04:22.189 --> 01:04:23.822
<i>Since when do you have time?</i>

1307
01:04:23.824 --> 01:04:25.257
I told you, I come prepared.

1308
01:04:25.259 --> 01:04:27.192
Here, put this on.

1309
01:04:27.194 --> 01:04:28.493
<i>Any stakes?</i>

1310
01:04:28.495 --> 01:04:31.563
No, but I do have these.

1311
01:04:31.565 --> 01:04:33.031
<i>Where did you find them?</i>

1312
01:04:33.033 --> 01:04:34.866
You can get anything
on the Internet.


1313
01:04:34.868 --> 01:04:37.869
Hey, uh, check the cameras
and tell me where they're at.


1314
01:04:39.572 --> 01:04:41.072
<i>Mike, they look anxious.</i>

1315
01:04:41.074 --> 01:04:42.874
<i>They're gonna catch on.</i>

1316
01:04:42.876 --> 01:04:45.277
Oh, shit, we gotta go now.

1317
01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:48.113
Carrie, come on,
you gotta wake up.


1318
01:04:48.115 --> 01:04:50.882
- No, I'm too tired.
- Oh, come on.


1319
01:04:50.884 --> 01:04:52.951
Hey, get the CF cards,
the hard drive


1320
01:04:52.953 --> 01:04:54.953
but leave everything else.

1321
01:04:54.955 --> 01:04:57.522
<i>- I'm grabbing the Hi8, too.
- Well, what-what for?</i>


1322
01:04:57.524 --> 01:05:00.358
<i>It's the one with night vision.
We might need it.</i>


1323
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.093
<i>Fine, whatever.</i>

1324
01:05:02.095 --> 01:05:05.931
<i>Carrie, Carrie,
you gotta get up.</i>


1325
01:05:05.933 --> 01:05:08.934
<i>- Hey, I-I got it all.
- Just put it in my backpack.</i>


1326
01:05:08.936 --> 01:05:12.904
<i>- Alright.
- Carrie, wake up. Carrie.</i>


1327
01:05:12.906 --> 01:05:16.875
<i>I'm gonna check
where they're at.</i>


1328
01:05:16.877 --> 01:05:19.177
<i>Mike, they're getting up.
We gotta go now.</i>


1329
01:05:19.179 --> 01:05:20.912
- Carrie, wake up!
- Oh.


1330
01:05:20.914 --> 01:05:22.347
- We gotta go right now.
- Okay.


1331
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:24.182
Come on, get up, get up.

1332
01:05:26.118 --> 01:05:29.087
<i>Holy shit, dude.
Look at her back!</i>


1333
01:05:29.089 --> 01:05:32.357
Uh, s-stay still, okay?
Uh, lemme see.


1334
01:05:32.359 --> 01:05:33.625
What's that?

1335
01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:36.628
- Oh, fuck!
- What? Is it bad?


1336
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:40.365
<i>Um, no, it's not that bad.</i>

1337
01:05:40.367 --> 01:05:44.169
<i>Listen, uh, can-can you walk?</i>

1338
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:46.271
- Yeah, 'cause we gotta go.
- Okay.


1339
01:05:46.273 --> 01:05:48.106
Okay, come on.

1340
01:05:48.108 --> 01:05:49.474
<i>Mike, they're gone.</i>

1341
01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:53.445
- Here, put this on.
- Okay.


1342
01:05:55.982 --> 01:05:58.250
Come on, come on, come on.

1343
01:05:58.252 --> 01:05:59.584
Here, take this.

1344
01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.121
<i>They're right at the door.</i>

1345
01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.495
Where'd they go?

1346
01:06:10.497 --> 01:06:13.164
<i>I don't, I don't know,
the-they're gone.</i>


1347
01:06:21.007 --> 01:06:22.474
<i>- Leaving us so soon?
- Fuck you.</i>


1348
01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:24.509
We don't plan on being
your next meal.


1349
01:06:24.511 --> 01:06:26.344
Well, now the cat's out of bag

1350
01:06:26.346 --> 01:06:28.613
I might as well show you
our true nature


1351
01:06:28.615 --> 01:06:31.016
so that you wouldn't be
too disappointed.


1352
01:06:31.018 --> 01:06:32.484
Hey, get the fuck back!

1353
01:06:33.653 --> 01:06:35.687
We were never gonna let you go.

1354
01:06:36.989 --> 01:06:38.056
Never.

1355
01:06:42.028 --> 01:06:44.095
Come on, come on, let's go.

1356
01:06:44.097 --> 01:06:45.363
Let's go, let's go!

1357
01:06:48.234 --> 01:06:51.036
Hey! Whoa, guys...

1358
01:06:52.338 --> 01:06:54.039
You think
you're going somewhere, huh?


1359
01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:55.674
- Huh?
- You have to let us go.


1360
01:06:55.676 --> 01:06:57.709
How's anyone gonna see
the footage we shot?


1361
01:06:57.711 --> 01:07:00.545
I don't need you for that.
I can deliver it myself.


1362
01:07:00.547 --> 01:07:04.950
Whoa! Look at you, bossman.
You wanna play, huh? Come on!


1363
01:07:04.952 --> 01:07:07.152
<i>- Mike!
- Whoa! Hoo! Hoo!</i>


1364
01:07:07.154 --> 01:07:09.254
Another knife. Okay, dear.

1365
01:07:09.256 --> 01:07:11.089
Think something's gonna happen?
Nothing's gonna happen.


1366
01:07:11.091 --> 01:07:12.991
Go ahead. Stick it in me, okay?

1367
01:07:12.993 --> 01:07:15.627
Don't look at him, look at me!
Stick it in me.


1368
01:07:15.629 --> 01:07:17.462
Nothing's gonna happen.
Here's my heart.


1369
01:07:17.464 --> 01:07:20.265
There you go, right there.
Okay, one, two...


1370
01:07:22.202 --> 01:07:23.535
<i>It's silver, asshole!</i>

1371
01:07:23.537 --> 01:07:25.570
Shit! Oh! Ah!

1372
01:07:37.283 --> 01:07:38.416
Come on, come on.

1373
01:07:38.418 --> 01:07:40.251
<i>- We gotta go.
- It's locked.</i>


1374
01:07:40.253 --> 01:07:42.487
<i>You won't get
out of the front door.</i>


1375
01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:45.657
It's sealed. You'll pay
for what you did to Blake.


1376
01:07:47.059 --> 01:07:49.094
<i>- Let's go out the back!
- Let's go.</i>


1377
01:07:49.096 --> 01:07:50.128
This way!

1378
01:07:52.665 --> 01:07:53.765
Stay back!

1379
01:07:56.268 --> 01:07:57.435
Dessert.

1380
01:08:00.539 --> 01:08:02.574
Keep moving. This way, this way.

1381
01:08:02.576 --> 01:08:04.576
Nowhere else to go.

1382
01:08:04.578 --> 01:08:07.479
Down here! Go, go, go!

1383
01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:09.481
<i>Michael, let's go up the line.</i>

1384
01:08:16.055 --> 01:08:17.589
<i>- Watch your step.
- Oh.</i>


1385
01:08:17.591 --> 01:08:20.291
- You know, I got it.
- Smells so bad in here.


1386
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:28.133
<i>- Get that light out of my eyes.
- Sorry.</i>


1387
01:08:31.103 --> 01:08:33.705
<i>- Whoa, what's this?
- Benny, quit...</i>


1388
01:08:33.707 --> 01:08:36.174
<i>- Guys, look at this.
- Quit fucking around, alright?</i>


1389
01:08:36.176 --> 01:08:38.777
<i>- They could be down any second.
- Looks just like Elle.</i>


1390
01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:40.311
<i>Probably some old painting.</i>

1391
01:08:40.313 --> 01:08:41.546
<i>Guys, look at it.</i>

1392
01:08:41.548 --> 01:08:43.481
<i>I
- I
-I
-I
-I think she's...</i>

1393
01:08:43.483 --> 01:08:44.682
We gotta move.

1394
01:08:51.624 --> 01:08:54.459
<i>Yeah, how do we know
there's a way out from...</i>


1395
01:08:54.461 --> 01:08:57.095
Well, it's better than
going back up there, isn't it?


1396
01:08:57.097 --> 01:08:58.730
Why aren't they following us?

1397
01:08:58.732 --> 01:09:00.498
<i>Shit, that's a good question.</i>

1398
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.401
Probably 'cause they think
we're gonna die down here.


1399
01:09:03.403 --> 01:09:05.737
<i>- Reassuring as always, asshole.
- Oh!</i>


1400
01:09:05.739 --> 01:09:08.073
You know,
you didn't have to come along.


1401
01:09:08.075 --> 01:09:10.108
- Please don't remind me.
- Then why did you?


1402
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:12.677
- You really wanna do this now?
- Yeah, I do.


1403
01:09:12.679 --> 01:09:16.414
Because I wanted to see
if you were gonna change.


1404
01:09:16.416 --> 01:09:18.383
Oh, what?
You want me all nice?


1405
01:09:18.385 --> 01:09:20.452
No, I want you
to fucking grow up.


1406
01:09:20.454 --> 01:09:22.187
Stop taking credit
for everything good


1407
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:25.256
and laying the blame for
everything bad on everyone else!


1408
01:09:27.393 --> 01:09:28.793
<i>Oh, Carrie, you alright?</i>

1409
01:09:28.795 --> 01:09:30.228
Hey, I'm sorry.

1410
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:32.330
I just need to rest
for a second.


1411
01:09:35.234 --> 01:09:36.734
Oh, fuck! Jesus!

1412
01:09:36.736 --> 01:09:39.370
<i>- Holy shit!
- Did you guys see that?</i>


1413
01:09:39.372 --> 01:09:40.772
No, we're fucking blind, Benny.

1414
01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:42.807
Why do you give me a hard time?

1415
01:09:42.809 --> 01:09:46.678
<i>- I don't give you a hard time.
- Yes, you have, from day one.</i>


1416
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.148
<i>I get you don't like me,
you don't want me on your team.</i>


1417
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:51.583
Haven't I earned the right to...

1418
01:09:51.585 --> 01:09:52.851
I've been to the most

1419
01:09:52.853 --> 01:09:54.652
dangerous places
in the world, right?


1420
01:09:54.654 --> 01:09:57.689
Where the fuck have you been?
You haven't earned shit.


1421
01:09:57.691 --> 01:09:59.424
<i>Carrie's right.
You're an asshole.</i>


1422
01:09:59.426 --> 01:10:02.327
Oh, my God. Guys, now's
not the fucking time, okay?


1423
01:10:05.598 --> 01:10:07.832
<i>This basement
seems to go on and on.</i>


1424
01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:10.401
And there's bodies everywhere.

1425
01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:14.472
Here, let's move this dresser.

1426
01:10:17.477 --> 01:10:19.210
Benny!

1427
01:10:19.212 --> 01:10:21.279
- Damn it.
- Thanks for the fucking help.


1428
01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:23.448
<i>I- I don't like
the looks of this.</i>


1429
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:26.618
Yeah, but it could be a way out.

1430
01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.520
- Carrie, let me go first.
- No.


1431
01:10:47.506 --> 01:10:48.606
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1432
01:10:48.608 --> 01:10:50.241
It smells even worse in here.

1433
01:10:50.243 --> 01:10:51.910
Oh, God, I can't even take it.

1434
01:11:02.321 --> 01:11:04.689
- Oh, fuck.
- I'm gonna be sick.


1435
01:11:06.525 --> 01:11:08.793
They've been lying to us.

1436
01:11:08.795 --> 01:11:12.430
<i>They're collecting bodies
down here.</i>


1437
01:11:12.432 --> 01:11:14.632
<i>There must be dozens of these.</i>

1438
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:19.304
<i>Oh, shit, what was that?</i>

1439
01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:23.975
I didn't like the sound
of that at all.


1440
01:11:23.977 --> 01:11:25.977
<i>Wait. Where's Carrie?</i>

1441
01:11:30.717 --> 01:11:32.483
<i>Carrie!</i>

1442
01:11:32.485 --> 01:11:33.952
<i>Mike, we gotta go!</i>

1443
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:37.555
Don't just stand there! Help me!

1444
01:11:37.557 --> 01:11:41.593
<i>- Take that, you fuckers!
- She looks bad.</i>


1445
01:11:41.595 --> 01:11:44.963
- How many times she's been bit?
- I don't know. Carrie?


1446
01:11:44.965 --> 01:11:46.497
Carrie, wake up.

1447
01:11:48.534 --> 01:11:51.336
<i>Is she gonna be okay?</i>

1448
01:11:51.338 --> 01:11:53.938
Uh, don't shine that light
in my eyes, Benny.


1449
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.009
Don't go to sleep, Carrie.
Here, have some water.


1450
01:12:00.747 --> 01:12:02.347
Okay, let me see.

1451
01:12:02.349 --> 01:12:04.249
<i>Shit!
What's wrong with her, Mike?</i>


1452
01:12:04.251 --> 01:12:06.751
<i>- I don't know.
- What did they do to me?</i>


1453
01:12:06.753 --> 01:12:08.353
<i>- You've become infected.
- Shit!</i>


1454
01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:10.021
<i>They're all around!
What do we do?</i>


1455
01:12:10.023 --> 01:12:12.557
- Well, I don't know!
- I'll-I'll draw them away.


1456
01:12:12.559 --> 01:12:15.660
- No!
- I'm dead anyways.


1457
01:12:15.662 --> 01:12:18.429
Remember what you said.
I'm doing this for a purpose.


1458
01:12:19.866 --> 01:12:21.266
<i>- Carrie!
- Shit!</i>


1459
01:12:21.268 --> 01:12:22.867
Get the lights outta here,
Benny!


1460
01:12:22.869 --> 01:12:24.335
<i>Get the knives!</i>

1461
01:12:25.537 --> 01:12:26.971
Go, go, go, go, go!

1462
01:12:35.314 --> 01:12:36.714
<i>Jesus, where'd it go?</i>

1463
01:12:37.816 --> 01:12:39.917
Go, go, back to...

1464
01:12:43.922 --> 01:12:45.023
<i>Mike!</i>

1465
01:12:46.425 --> 01:12:48.760
<i>- Come on.
- The dresser.</i>


1466
01:12:48.762 --> 01:12:50.495
<i>We gotta go, we gotta...</i>

1467
01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:56.934
<i>- What do we do?
- Come on.</i>


1468
01:13:03.475 --> 01:13:04.942
<i>Wait!</i>

1469
01:13:10.016 --> 01:13:11.749
<i>Oh, no. Oh, shit. Dude.</i>

1470
01:13:11.751 --> 01:13:13.818
Turn your light off.

1471
01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:17.488
<i>- I've my night-vision camera.
- Here, take this holy water.</i>


1472
01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:20.425
Here, grab my gun.

1473
01:13:30.436 --> 01:13:33.004
What do you see?

1474
01:13:33.006 --> 01:13:34.639
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

1475
01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:37.542
<i>Behind you!</i>

1476
01:13:42.415 --> 01:13:44.482
<i>- No. Shit!
- Where's the gun?</i>


1477
01:13:44.484 --> 01:13:47.785
<i>Here! Shoot him in the heart!</i>

1478
01:13:47.787 --> 01:13:49.053
<i>Shoot him!</i>

1479
01:13:55.895 --> 01:13:57.995
Take that, you ugly bastard!

1480
01:14:00.032 --> 01:14:02.800
<i>I always thought
that silver was for werewolves.</i>


1481
01:14:02.802 --> 01:14:05.903
<i>Glad that a few of the myths
had some truth to them.</i>


1482
01:14:05.905 --> 01:14:08.840
Yeah, well, myths had to come
from something.


1483
01:14:08.842 --> 01:14:12.410
I read somewhere that
silver works on vampires, too.


1484
01:14:12.412 --> 01:14:16.514
Hey, check your phone app.
Do you see anyone in the house?


1485
01:14:16.516 --> 01:14:20.051
<i>Nobody around. It's 6:15.
Should be daylight soon.</i>


1486
01:14:20.053 --> 01:14:22.787
<i>- Fine, stay close.
- Yeah.</i>


1487
01:14:33.532 --> 01:14:35.133
There's the back door. Let's go.

1488
01:14:35.135 --> 01:14:37.402
<i>Are you leaving again?</i>

1489
01:14:37.404 --> 01:14:39.837
After we've shown you
all our dirty, little secrets.


1490
01:14:39.839 --> 01:14:41.873
Yeah, we've seen all the people
you've killed.


1491
01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:43.508
You're hiding behind a facade.

1492
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:46.577
Facade? Yours is the facade.

1493
01:14:46.579 --> 01:14:48.012
You've been pretending
the entire time


1494
01:14:48.014 --> 01:14:49.680
you've been with us.

1495
01:14:49.682 --> 01:14:51.449
Stay the fuck back.

1496
01:14:51.451 --> 01:14:53.551
Guns! Guns, honey.

1497
01:14:53.553 --> 01:14:54.986
Guns have been used against us

1498
01:14:54.988 --> 01:14:56.954
for hundreds of years
to no avail.


1499
01:14:58.725 --> 01:15:00.558
Yeah, but this is loaded
with silver.


1500
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.993
<i>- Really?
- Fuckin' shoot him!</i>


1501
01:15:17.576 --> 01:15:20.545
Now! Where is your friend,
Carrie?


1502
01:15:20.547 --> 01:15:23.181
- Did she get lost down below?
- Is she in the tunnels?


1503
01:15:23.183 --> 01:15:26.017
Because if she is,
you'll never see her again!


1504
01:15:26.019 --> 01:15:28.619
Revive him. Revive him.

1505
01:15:28.621 --> 01:15:32.190
If he wants to film something,
he can film his friend's demise.


1506
01:15:32.192 --> 01:15:33.658
Have some water, Benny.

1507
01:15:37.497 --> 01:15:39.530
<i>It's holy water, bitch!</i>

1508
01:15:56.114 --> 01:15:57.849
Yes, I'll explain.

1509
01:15:57.851 --> 01:16:00.618
We're in
a bit of a standoff here.


1510
01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:03.821
Now, you let her go
and I will let you both live.


1511
01:16:03.823 --> 01:16:05.857
Don't do it, Benny,
they'll kill us both!


1512
01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:07.925
Always the wrong assumptions.

1513
01:16:07.927 --> 01:16:10.261
You bloodsacks
are so predictable.


1514
01:16:10.263 --> 01:16:12.497
<i>I know more
than you think, man.</i>


1515
01:16:12.499 --> 01:16:13.865
By all means, enlighten us.

1516
01:16:13.867 --> 01:16:15.900
<i>I know that Elleanor's
one of the elders.</i>


1517
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:19.637
Ah! Oh, no.

1518
01:16:21.773 --> 01:16:22.840
Get off of me!

1519
01:16:27.013 --> 01:16:30.081
Go, go, go! Benny! Let's go!

1520
01:16:37.589 --> 01:16:40.024
<i>- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming.</i>


1521
01:16:40.026 --> 01:16:41.759
How did you know?

1522
01:16:41.761 --> 01:16:45.229
<i>- I saw the painting.
- That's why Andrew let go of me.</i>


1523
01:16:45.231 --> 01:16:48.766
<i>Samuel said they'd all be in
pain if an elder were killed.</i>


1524
01:16:51.771 --> 01:16:55.072
<i>Holy shit! We made it!</i>

1525
01:16:55.074 --> 01:16:56.908
<i>Tell me you have
your fucking keys!</i>


1526
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:58.809
Yeah, I got 'em right here.

1527
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:02.079
- So you got all that on camera?
- Yeah, it's still rolling, man.


1528
01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:03.915
<i>- We got everything.
- You know something, Benny?</i>


1529
01:17:03.917 --> 01:17:05.616
<i>What's that?</i>

1530
01:17:05.618 --> 01:17:07.685
You're welcome on my crew
anytime.


1531
01:17:08.654 --> 01:17:11.122
God. You hear that?

1532
01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:14.258
I'm welcome anytime.

1533
01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.027
Good evening. I'm Paul Linn.

1534
01:17:16.029 --> 01:17:17.962
Tonight we have
sectional leader, Samuel


1535
01:17:17.964 --> 01:17:19.730
who joins us live via satellite

1536
01:17:19.732 --> 01:17:21.766
to discuss
the recent vampire debates.


1537
01:17:21.768 --> 01:17:24.168
Samuel, thanks for joining us.

1538
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:27.171
My pleasure, Paul.
Great to be here.


1539
01:17:27.173 --> 01:17:30.241
What is it you wanna tell us
about the rumors of violence


1540
01:17:30.243 --> 01:17:32.743
done by so-called vampires?

1541
01:17:32.745 --> 01:17:34.712
This is pure ignorance.

1542
01:17:34.714 --> 01:17:36.113
None of our kind

1543
01:17:36.115 --> 01:17:38.916
want to use violence
against humans as an option.


1544
01:17:38.918 --> 01:17:41.319
None of us. We find it
ridiculous and insulting


1545
01:17:41.321 --> 01:17:42.787
What about the spreading rumors

1546
01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:44.789
of a missing news crew
from KMMBR


1547
01:17:44.791 --> 01:17:47.825
that was sent in to interview
a vampire family


1548
01:17:47.827 --> 01:17:50.027
that you arranged?

1549
01:17:50.029 --> 01:17:53.130
Paul,
that is blatantly ridiculous.


1550
01:17:53.132 --> 01:17:55.800
If that happened,
where is the proof?


1551
01:17:55.802 --> 01:17:57.234
There isn't any proof.

1552
01:17:57.236 --> 01:18:00.671
- I never, ever...
- But, Samuel...


1553
01:18:00.673 --> 01:18:02.306
And the sheer audacity

1554
01:18:02.308 --> 01:18:04.709
that-that-that
we're somehow responsible


1555
01:18:04.711 --> 01:18:07.111
for the disappearance
of a news crew, it's...


1556
01:18:07.113 --> 01:18:09.146
I- I'll tell you what?
I find this...


1557
01:18:09.148 --> 01:18:11.649
Personally, I find this
extremely insulting.


1558
01:18:11.651 --> 01:18:14.952
Well, we have someone
who disagrees with you on this.


1559
01:18:14.954 --> 01:18:17.388
We have live, via satellite,
Mr. Aaron Stafford


1560
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:20.024
who is
the KMMBR station manager.


1561
01:18:20.026 --> 01:18:22.893
Aaron, thanks for joining us.
Would you care to comment?


1562
01:18:22.895 --> 01:18:24.362
bastard.

1563
01:18:24.364 --> 01:18:27.665
Excuse me, I, I'm not sure
what kind of a smear campaign


1564
01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:30.134
you're tryin' to run here,
but, uh, I don't believe


1565
01:18:30.136 --> 01:18:32.837
you and I have ever met.

1566
01:18:32.839 --> 01:18:35.172
We received a tape from Aaron
this morning.


1567
01:18:35.174 --> 01:18:37.008
Let's play some of that footage.

1568
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.076
But, folks,
what you're about to see


1569
01:18:39.078 --> 01:18:40.778
is extremely graphic.

1570
01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:44.048
Viewer discretion
is strongly advised.


1571
01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:46.984
- Go now.
- It's quite an ancient ritual.


1572
01:18:46.986 --> 01:18:49.420
You're the first humans
we've ever allowed to see this.


1573
01:18:49.422 --> 01:18:51.656
Then why don't you want us
filming it?


1574
01:18:51.658 --> 01:18:54.091
I don't think the public
in general's ready to witness


1575
01:18:54.093 --> 01:18:56.894
this particular ceremony.
Do you?


1576
01:18:56.896 --> 01:18:58.796
Well, shall we begin?

1577
01:18:58.798 --> 01:19:00.831
My dear,
why don't you do the honors?


1578
01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:03.801
- Thank you.
- No, please, no!


1579
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:16.180
I never get to make a wish.

1580
01:19:16.182 --> 01:19:20.151
Hey, Benny, you wanna see
what it, see what it looks like?


1581
01:19:20.153 --> 01:19:22.019
I'm welcome anytime.

1582
01:19:24.123 --> 01:19:26.057
Ah! Mornin', boys.

1583
01:19:26.059 --> 01:19:28.726
How about that close-up?

1584
01:19:28.728 --> 01:19:32.029
After tonight, the whole world
will see this footage.


1585
01:19:35.701 --> 01:19:37.968
And they will find you...

1586
01:19:39.438 --> 01:19:44.241
and they'll take your
miserable, blood-sucking body


1587
01:19:44.243 --> 01:19:47.311
and they'll rip you apart.

1588
01:19:47.313 --> 01:19:49.213
<i>What about that, Samuel?</i>

1589
01:19:49.215 --> 01:19:51.015
Care to comment to our viewers?

1590
01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:04.495
Just keep the camera rolling.
The footage is gonna be amazing.


1591
01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:11.368
I never stop rolling... bitch.

1592
01:20:14.873 --> 01:20:17.742
We don't wanna hurt anyone
in any way, shape or form.


1593
01:20:21.813 --> 01:20:24.014
Were you filming earlier
when we were arguing?


1594
01:20:24.016 --> 01:20:25.349
<i>Of course not.</i>

1595
01:20:30.155 --> 01:20:31.455
Is that camera off?

1596
01:20:31.457 --> 01:20:33.023
<i>Oh, yeah, i-it's off.</i>

1597
01:20:37.262 --> 01:20:40.798
I guess I'll have to get used
to having a camera around.


1598
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.899
Good.

1599
01:20:45.403 --> 01:20:47.204
<i>- How do I look?
- Good.</i>


1600
01:20:47.206 --> 01:20:48.839
Yeah? Cool.

1601
01:20:53.278 --> 01:20:55.246
Do I look like I have fangs?

1602
01:20:55.248 --> 01:20:56.514
Go, go!

1603
01:21:03.221 --> 01:21:04.421
Peace out.
