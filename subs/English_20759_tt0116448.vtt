1
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.520
<i>So they manifest jealousy and envy</i>

2
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.958
We are halfway through the sixth round
of this heavyweight title fight,


3
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.247
- and unofficially I got the champ ahead.
- Why wouldn't you?


4
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.279
He's giving a one-way beating.
He is administrating a licking to this kid.


5
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.319
It's called the "sweet science", this
sport of boxing. It is a carnival of carnage.


6
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.322
This is the vineyard of the fistic arts

7
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.608
and the grapes of pugilism are being
stomped into a ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pulp.


8
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.603
- Get outta the way.
- Uh... An arena ve-ver-very...


9
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.639
Why don't you move your fucking crew
out the way? You're fucking up my view.


10
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.359
And the groundlings very much aroused,
as they should be.


11
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.363
But this is not a boxing arena.
It's the Globe Theatre. It's the Old Vic.


12
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.079
These people aren't watching
a heavyweight title fight, but <i>King Lear.</i>


13
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.126
Hey, hey! Motherfucker, is you deaf?

14
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.842
Shit, man, I didn't pay no $1500
for both these seats...


15
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.879
- to see no fucking <i>King Lear!</i> What's wrong?
- My brother, I'm a man of peace.


16
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.848
- My bro...? Oh, hell, no!

17
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.685
I can't let no white motherfucker call me
brother. Besides, my brother is dead.


18
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.806
All right. Cut. New deal.

19
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.565
Moving on quickly. Here we go.
Proceed. Proceed quickly.


20
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.404
There's three of you and one of me,
and you're running like roaches.


21
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.966
Punch or get out.

22
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.688
Hit him. Hit him. Hit him.

23
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.078
- Go to your corner.

24
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.081
Three, four,

25
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.365
five, six,

26
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.247
seven, eight,

27
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.321
nine, ten.

28
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.526
He's out.

29
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.962
The Lord God Jehovah is a mighty God.
Am I right?


30
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.610
A mighty God.

31
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.646
Champ. Champ.

32
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.925
You're a beautiful human being.

33
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.685
Come on over, baby.
Ferdie wants to talk to you.


34
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.238
Was that as easy
a fight as it looked?

35
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.527
Of course it was.
I'm the greatest fighter in the world.


36
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.569
- Even in China. Nobody can beat me.
- Are you mad at something?


37
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.485
I'm a little upset with myself, because I had
an image of him falling on a right hand,


38
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.721
but I hit him so hard with the left
that his jaw shattered.


39
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.801
When I came with the right
he was on the ground.


40
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.883
Glory be to God. All praises to Allah.
God bless America.


41
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.609
This is a great
champion and a great man.

42
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.045
If I could have
the fighter back a minute?

43
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.759
It makes a difference to you how he falls?
With a left or a right?


44
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.205
Definitely. I'm an artist out there and...

45
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.602
It's like I painted a picture of the Mona Lisa
and forgot to put the breast on.


46
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.239
The champ <i>is</i> an artist,
and he's the greatest showman on the planet.


47
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.164
And the greatest fighter. No man can beat
this man at this point in his life,


48
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.128
and I want you to know,
Marvin Shabazz, wherever you are,


49
00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.887
watch the things you say, cos we hear.
There's a space on his wall for your head,


50
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.882
along with the other heads
he already has on his wall.


51
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.007
- Let me borrow...
- We're calling the taxidermist now.


52
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.684
Let me get the fighter back.
Did this guy hurt you?


53
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.319
Not at all. He hit me one time,
to wake me up, because I was bored.


54
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.401
- Bored?
- That's right.


55
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.606
It was like fighting my little sister.

56
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.366
OK, ladies and gentlemen of the press,
I am now proud to present to you


57
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:29.969
the undisputed and still undefeated
heavyweight champion of the world,


58
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.962
James "The Grim Reaper" Roper.

59
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.280
- This is a press conference. Sit down.
- Shut up, mofo.


60
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.486
Sit down. It's a press conference.

61
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.286
- I wanna say, "All praise to Allah. "
- <i>Allah akbar,</i> Champ!


62
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.759
Send some love out to my dear, and
a special shout-out to the Reverend Sultan,


63
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.159
cos without him I wouldn't even be around.

64
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.401
- Who do you plan to fight next?
- Uh, well...


65
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.368
That's the reverend's job.
He sets 'em up, I knock 'em out.


66
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:09.400
Bullshit. I'm the No. 1 contender, and
I'm tired of you motherfuckers ducking me.


67
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.005
We ain't ducking you, man.
You're just so black we can't find you.


68
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.046
Fuck you.

69
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.442
Marvin Shabazz, you're a great fighter.
And you will get your title shot.


70
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.929
Oh-oh. No, no.

71
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.968
See, what we want is a guarantee -
that's right -


72
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.248
that my man, Marvin Shabazz Flex O'Neil...
Marvin, will you?


73
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.561
Boy, that boy's good.
I'm saying everybody knows he's good.


74
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.440
We're just asking the Reverend Sultan
to give us a shot at the title. Can you just...


75
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.328
- Stop running like a B-I-itch.
- B-I-itch?


76
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.605
- It's bi-atch.
- Where the fuck you from?


77
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.727
Listen. Why don't you get some Ambi,
brighten your ass up,


78
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.608
stop looking like a oil spill?
Then we talk business.


79
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.128
I'll tell you what, honk. I'll stick my dick so far
up your fucking ass I impale your tonsils.


80
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.565
- Oh, that's a pretty picture.
- Shut up.


81
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.084
- All right.
- Fake-ass black man.


82
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.889
- Is this what you want?
- You don't deserve it.


83
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.245
- I'll spank you with it.
- Spank him, Champ!


84
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.165
- I'll spank you with it. Come here.
- Spank me. You ain't hurting.


85
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.004
You wanna drive a Rolls-Royce,
but you don't wanna beat the champ.


86
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.285
Till you beat me, 
I am the champ.

87
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.483
- Thanks.
- How's everybody?


88
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.929
Hey, baby. How's everything? Hey.
Everybody enjoy yourself, all right?


89
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.640
- How was the house, Peter?
- We gave away 4,000 seats to charity.


90
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.167
Fred, we keep putting up fights like this,
I'm gonna have to sell the fucking hotel.


91
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.367
- You get the pay-per-view pick-up?
- I understand that...


92
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.600
- Artemus!
- Yeah. OK.


93
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.681
Yes. Yeah.

94
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.807
- Bad news.
- How bad?


95
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.599
Pay-per-view was down 50 per cent
on the last heavyweight title fight.


96
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.842
- 75 per cent from the previous one.
- Yeah, we lost our ass.


97
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.248
But we got a $10 million guarantee
to pay the champ.


98
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:07.848
Well, I just un-guaranteed it. Buy him
another fucking Rolls-Royce. Buy him two.


99
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.206
- He's got six already.
- Well, now he's got eight.


100
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.888
- Here he is.
- Showtime, boys.


101
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.165
Who's in the house?

102
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.164
The heavyweight champion of the world!

103
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.406
- I love you.
- Not like I love you.


104
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.162
- No, I love you.
- I love you.


105
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.529
- You my brother.
- You're my nigger if your turban gets bigger.


106
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.322
- I love you.
- Wait a minute. That's the third "I love you".


107
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.049
- Am I getting jerked again?
- You my brother.


108
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.248
- I know that, but am I getting fucked again?
- I love you.


109
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.925
- Artemus, am I getting jerked?
- He's your brother.


110
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.881
Sol.

111
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.961
- He loves you.
- I love you.


112
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.086
- Forget this, man!
- Champ. Champ.


113
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.049
No, Reverend. This is the payday.
This is the day we've been waiting for.


114
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.202
- You're my brother.
- I got your brother hanging low.


115
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.566
I had 38 fights for you and won 'em all.
What I got to show for it?


116
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.210
- Six Rolls-Royces?
- Wait. You got eight.


117
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.963
No, I got a guaranteed contract
for $10 million.


118
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.281
- Have you read it?
- I don't need to read it. I'll sue your ass.


119
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.043
- Sue his ass, Champ.
- For everything.


120
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.325
- Sue me.
- Sue him.


121
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.045
- I love you.
- This is bullshit, man. Stop saying that!


122
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.088
- All right? Yo, Irv!
- I'll be back.


123
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.479
What up, kid?

124
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.561
Ooh!

125
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.005
- Wardell.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Excuse me.


126
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.889
Let me help you up.

127
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.484
Let me fix your hat. All right.

128
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.839
Can you forgive me as I forgive you?

129
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.320
- What am I forgiving you for now, man?
- For being human.


130
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.526
For being flawed.

131
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.487
I hurt. I bleed.

132
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.448
No, Rev. I hurt. I bleed.

133
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.442
And I want my goddamn money.

134
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.328
Now!

135
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.485
Sweetheart, could you...

136
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.441
Sit.

137
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.439
There better be some money
under this couch.


138
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.998
All right, everybody, you heard him.

139
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.686
- The champ wants his money.
- That's what he said.


140
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.729
Artemus. We will pay the champ
what we're obligated to pay him.


141
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.166
Sell my house, sell
my cars, sell these rings,

142
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.764
disband my company, fire the employees,

143
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.002
and file Chapter 11, and we'll settle
with the champ for - what?


144
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.843
15 cents on the dollar?

145
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.246
Do it.

146
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.963
Champ.

147
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:08.285
You would let this man, the only father figure
you've ever had, destroy himself for you?


148
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.442
- You bet your yarmulke.
- Well, consider it done.


149
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.603
No. No, Fred, please.
Now, you're just a little upset.


150
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:21.322
Of course I'm upset.
I'm upset, because I know what's wrong.


151
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.128
Peter.

152
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.963
- You know what's wrong?
- No.


153
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.484
- Artemus?
- No.


154
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.367
- Sol?
- No.


155
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.601
- How about you, Champ?
- I don't know nothing any more.


156
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.844
There's a reason everyone has lost interest in
the heavyweight championship of the world.


157
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.319
And it's very simple.

158
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.725
People are tired of paying good money

159
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.768
to watch niggers beat up niggers.

160
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.889
I need a white heavyweight contender
worse than white America needs one.


161
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.282
Come on. White? Heavyweight?
Man, the two words don't even go together.


162
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.123
That's like saying "black unity".

163
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.201
Hey, look, man, cut the bullshit.
I want Shabazz.


164
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.202
Shut up, boy! You work for me.

165
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:12.121
And if you do shut up,
and you do work for me,


166
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.089
you'll make more money
than you've ever dreamed of.


167
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.809
You'll make $40 million.

168
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.002
If I'm making 40,
look how much you're gonna make.


169
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.127
- I am.
- Hey, look, Rev.


170
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.520
Nobody gonna buy the idea
of a white contender.


171
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.640
It ain't about race. 
It's about boxing.

172
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.648
- Sit down.
- I just stood up.


173
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.160
What's the highest-grossing fight
in the history of boxing?


174
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.684
- Uh, Tyson-Gibbons.
- Ali-Frazier.


175
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.001
- Hagler-Leonard.
- No, Hagler-Hearns.


176
00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.206
No, no, no, no, no,

177
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.440
no, no, no, no!

178
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.082
The highest-grossing fight
in the history of boxing...


179
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.526
Is Cooney versus Holmes.

180
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.206
- Can you tell me why, James?
- Yeah. Cos Cooney was a white boy.


181
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.168
And his jab couldn't break wind.

182
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.047
If there ain't a white
guy out there for you,

183
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.042
I'm gonna create you one.

184
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.006
<i>Fred Sultan.</i>

185
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.766
<i>You and I are gonna take a close look</i>
<i>at this boxing promoter,</i>


186
00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.286
<i>this exploiter, embezzler,</i>

187
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.567
<i>charlatan and demagogue.</i>

188
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.770
<i>By the time our journey is over,</i>
<i>I'm gonna expose him for what he really is:</i>


189
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.205
<i>The devil incarnate.</i>

190
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.839
<i>The real story begins in 1953 in Atlanta,</i>

191
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.888
<i>when a young man</i>
<i>by the name of Fred Johnson,</i>


192
00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.006
<i>who had been a child evangelist</i>

193
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.719
<i>and who'd been caught running</i>
<i>a pyramid scam on his parishioners,</i>


194
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:08.885
<i>was arrested and convicted for assault. He</i>
<i>nearly stomped a man to death, very brutally.</i>


195
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.883
<i>What army is this? All right, all right.</i>
<i>Enough. Not again. Not again.</i>


196
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.849
- <i>Get this on camera.</i>
- <i>Don't you touch him again.</i>


197
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.764
- Yes. Rolling.
- I've got here Marvin Shabazz,


198
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.410
the man next in
line to fight James Roper.

199
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.449
Well, that's how it should be.
But I got a bad feeling about this one.


200
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.968
And if Sultan doesn't give us a shot at the title
and he tries to duck us, we will sue him.


201
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.281
That's right.
And I will support these men, honorable...


202
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.045
I'll take it, baby.
These are honorable men, very... uh, yes.


203
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.884
We are honorable men,
but I've worked too hard for this.


204
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.360
I am the No. 1 contender.
I'm tired of James the poodle -


205
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.408
"Grim Reaper", whatever
he calls himself - ducking me.


206
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.403
I'm tired of him driving around
in eight Rolls-Royces. He's fought nobody.


207
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.163
- I'm still in a Brougham.
- Exactly.


208
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.447
- A what?
- Uh, a Brougham.


209
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.169
He drives a Brougham.

210
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.128
- What's a Brougham?
- It's maroon.


211
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.050
Well, actually it's not maroon. What it is...

212
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.769
It's merlot. And it's a Brougham.

213
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.647
Cut.

214
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.925
- Have we cut?
- Yeah.


215
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.968
- What's a merlot Brougham?
- It's an old car, right?


216
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.042
You guys don't know
what a merlot Brougham is?


217
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.724
I thought it was a breakfast cereal, myself.

218
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.722
- It's a Cadillac.
- Oh.


219
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.528
- A Braham?
- A Brougham.


220
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.966
- A Brougham. I got it.
- Not Braham. A Brougham.


221
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.883
- Rolling. Let's pick up.
- And again.


222
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:42.044
Action. The merlot Brougham.
It's a fine car, but nothing like a Rolls-Royce.


223
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.123
And you guys are plenty peeved.

224
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.486
Yeah. I don't care about the cars.
I just wanna fight.


225
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.562
That's all. Like my daddy say -
you out there, James?


226
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.245
The poodle, pussy, whatever your name is?
"If you a man, be a man. "


227
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.083
Step up. Fight me. 
You ain't fought nobody.

228
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.445
Your daddy said...

229
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.647
What? Is he talking about the poodle...?

230
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.245
No, no, no, no, no. It's just a fact.
You growing up in the 'hood.


231
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.686
You become a man. You wanna start
acting like a man, you be a man.


232
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.809
Just like my father had told me
that when the green grass starts growing


233
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.484
on the other side,
somebody gotta cut the lawn.


234
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.721
You know, my father said once,
"When you... when you, uh...


235
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.324
laugh, and the whole world laughs with you,

236
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.766
cry, and I'll give you something
to cry about, you bastard. "


237
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.728
And you know what that's done to me?

238
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.688
Uh-uh, I'm, uh... I'm not sure.

239
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.207
- You're a little camera-shy, aren't you?
- Sometimes, but I'm getting the hang of it.


240
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:39.928
Yeah.

241
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.487
This the guy
at the top of your list, Julio?


242
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.880
He's at the top of my punching bag list.
Look at this shit.


243
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.289
Fuck.

244
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.407
- Oh!
- There he goes.


245
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.929
That's my assistant.
I could introduce you.


246
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.798
- Julio, come on.
- Looks like two moons over Miami.


247
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.279
Come on. Let's go.

248
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.479
I like this guy. Squeaky-clean, shit-don't-
stink, Mouseketeer-looking motherfucker.


249
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.643
- Yeah. Pat Boone in boxing gloves.
- You know, John Wayne is his uncle.


250
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.485
- Watch him get Mouseketeer ears.
- Don't look like John Wayne now.


251
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.600
- Next.
- Come on. Get the next one on.


252
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.568
- This guy's hair!
- Tarzan.


253
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:39.440
- He's part of the space programme.
- This guy's good. Swarthy, mysterious,


254
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.283
strong-jawed, sexy... 
Women might like it.

255
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.999
- They'll eat it up.
- He's a Suave Bola guy.


256
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.078
- Try to towel off.
- Next.


257
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:57.200
- <i>There in South Africa, the...</i>
- South Africa, Julio? South Africa?


258
00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.009
- Good for you.
- Oh, I felt that.


259
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.208
- Dolph Lundgren.
- I like this guy.


260
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.407
- I was at this fight. Two months ago.
- Yeah? What happened?


261
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.209
- Watch.
- <i>Rocky VI.</i>


262
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.247
Oh!

263
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.762
- Oh, my God.
- That guy had to have his jaw rewired.


264
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.443
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.


265
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.968
My God. It's a shame political power in this
country's not determined in a boxing ring.


266
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.360
If it was, we'd learn how to fight.

267
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.760
- See? I told you...
- You told me shit, Julio!


268
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.169
Ahem.

269
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.038
- I have an idea.
- Hey. Shut the fuck up and run the tapes.


270
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.406
Oh, you're gonna clown me?
You can run this shit yourself.


271
00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

272
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.641
He apologizes.

273
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.998
Speak, please. Come on.

274
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.718
I was simply trying to say...

275
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.166
The champ.
He's never lost as a professional. Right?


276
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.923
- Yeah. Newsflash.
- What gave it away? His record?


277
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.161
But... he's lost as an amateur. Right?

278
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.083
- So what?
- Yeah, so what? BFD.


279
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.448
- So, who beat him?
- Who cares? He was an amateur.


280
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:23.081
- Amateurs don't count, honey.
- Are you high? Are you on something?


281
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:28.119
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Shut the fuck up.
Don't you realize what she's saying?


282
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.486
Ten years ago,
who beat Roper as an amateur?


283
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.840
His mother.

284
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.765
Who?

285
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.410
Terry Conklin.

286
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.766
Sweetheart, you are smarter
than all these clowns put together.


287
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.644
- Terry who?
- You work for me now.


288
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:59.599
- Hey, wait a minute. She works for me.
- Julio, she works for me.


289
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.568
OK. Fine. You got her.

290
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.086
- Welcome, sweetheart.
- Check the "sweetheart" shit at the door.


291
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.764
- Ooh.
- She works for you now.


292
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.886
Excuse me, Ms Bambi.

293
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.245
And you get a 10 per cent raise.

294
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.719
- Now, where were we?
- Terry Conklin.


295
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.883
Terry Conklin. From Cleveland.
Golden Gloves champion.


296
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.998
Good left hook, great overhand right.
Undefeated as an amateur.


297
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.606
Discovered God, or drugs, or pussy.
Some such thing...


298
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:33.286
Man.
Look at how they live. Let's get down.


299
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.283
...Marciano for inner fucking peace.
- Jeez, what a dumb fuck he was.


300
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.362
- Unbelievable.
- You wanna find his Brady-Bunch ass?


301
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.441
I'll call Bert Sugar.

302
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.120
You ain't fucking me no more.

303
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.122
Disperse, bitches, will you?

304
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.964
Marvin.

305
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:53.847
Marvin, chill.

306
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.525
See, this is what happens
when you're living lavish, sipping wine,


307
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.523
then we come in Nino-Brown-style.
Yeah, yeah. That's what it's about.


308
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:07.162
Then the next thing you know, we got guns
on you, and what you got? What you got?


309
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.889
You got a... a whole, uh...

310
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.724
whole bunch of guns w-w-with lasers on 'em,
and we don't have any of those.


311
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.246
But, I mean, you know,
does violence really solve anything?


312
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.128
We came over because
you hadn't answered our calls,


313
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.519
and we thought
maybe something was wrong.


314
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.488
We just wanted to let you know
we got your back.


315
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.529
And, uh... you know,
you haven't offered us a shot at the title,


316
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:35.649
and it's just a rumor, but people talk
about you trying to duck my man...


317
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.166
Marvin, I'm giving you the title shot.

318
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.720
As a matter of fact,
we were just discussing the details.


319
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.278
Yeah. There's some legal... Hello.

320
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.124
There's some legal shit we have to
work out before we make you an offer.


321
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.159
We're just trying to get
all of our ducks in a row.


322
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.003
Yeah. It's a duck thing.

323
00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.365
Oh, oh. OK. Duck thing.

324
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.601
- So you are giving us a shot at the title.
- You have my word.


325
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.124
Excuse me, but your word don't mean shit.

326
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.919
Yeah, I mean, your word is rather doo-doo.

327
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.923
Uh... we're looking for something tangible.

328
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.401
Fuck tangible. Give me something real.
I want something real. That's what I want.


329
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.927
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Just, you know... calm down, will you?


330
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.161
We're gonna get everything together.
We come in peace, man.


331
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.289
You know, we're small-time.
We just want a shot. That's all we asking for.


332
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.168
Whoo!

333
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.122
I'd like to give you a sign of good faith.
While I get my ducks in a row.


334
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:42.125
- Fuck is all this duck shit, you...
- Chill with all these dots.


335
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.204
We're trying to, you know, negotiate.
Let me do business.


336
00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.885
Are you still driving that, um...
maroon Brougham?


337
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.562
Yeah.

338
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.359
I don't mean to correct you
in front of your people, but it's merlot.


339
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.362
- Oh, sorry. Merlot.
- Yeah.


340
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:03.602
I'd like to give you a brand-new
merlot Brougham. As a sign of good faith.


341
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.885
Cos you're my brother, and I love you.

342
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.689
Cool. Cool. That's...
that sounds, you know...


343
00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:14.128
- No, I'm tired of merlot.
- Yeah, he's right. I can't stand another merlot.


344
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.567
Well, baby, you know,
there's this sweet, gold...


345
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.483
- Oh, kind of a muscatel.
- Go on, sister.


346
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.482
All right. Yeah. 
Hey, that's fine. Muscatel.

347
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.845
- Artemus?
- Yeah.


348
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.128
Order a brand-new,
muscatel Royale Brougham,


349
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.929
fully loaded, with, uh...

350
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.729
a petite syrah interior.

351
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:41.008
- Have it delivered to Mr. Shabazz at once.
- Got it.


352
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.924
Thanks, man. I... You know, that's...
you know, that really means a lot.


353
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.202
I would take it that
a fully loaded muscatel Brougham,


354
00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.761
with a syrah-serials and petite
and everything like that,


355
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.684
is a good-faith down
payment on a title fight.

356
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.245
My brothers.

357
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.959
Hey, I'm glad we could, you know,
straighten this out. Is this rayon?


358
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.565
This is nice.
Whole thing got my blood pressure up, bro.


359
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.687
Thank you. All right, man.
Come on. Hug him, man.


360
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.085
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.


361
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.644
We're about to be champs, baby!

362
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.609
My daddy said, "Don't pull your shit out
if you ain't ready to use it. "


363
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.762
- Shut up!
- Bitch.


364
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.761
I gotta change.

365
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.526
<i>Sultan, I got him.</i>

366
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.809
<i>Terry Conklin is still living in Cleveland.</i>
<i>He's in a band called Massive Head Wound.</i>


367
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:58.964
<i>Uh-huh. Yeah. For the kids.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm booking the flight now.</i>


368
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.809
- This guy's a putz.
- No, he's got something.


369
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.768
- You like him, Bambi?
- I think he's gorgeous.


370
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.125
- Say what?
- For a white boy.


371
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:52.362
- Right.
- I think we found our man.


372
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.808
Terry.

373
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.121
Terry, this is Suzette.

374
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.044
Wonderful music, Terry. Wonderful.

375
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.598
I feel that you're my brother.

376
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.522
- I'm your anti-brother.
- My anti-brother!


377
00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:38.400
- I like that.
- You know, actually, you're a poet.


378
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.845
Well, an anti-poet.

379
00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.326
Terry?

380
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.521
All right. Come on,
hit the bricks. Get out.

381
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.568
You know, it... it feels like...

382
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.720
- ooh, like anti-music.
- Terry.


383
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.638
This is Angel.

384
00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.441
Cool.

385
00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.961
I worship you.

386
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:08.760
Worship... is a Judaeo
-Christian concept.

387
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.239
- I'm a Buddhist.
- No shit.


388
00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.610
Sol, heads up.

389
00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.603
Terry. May I call you Terry?

390
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.126
What you call me is
of no concern to me.

391
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.523
Good. Cos I'm gonna call your ass
"the great white hope".


392
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.922
Excuse me. Terry, I'm trying to make you
a business proposition here.


393
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.803
- I give my money to the homeless.
- Good.


394
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.519
Then if you take me up on my proposition
and return to the ring,


395
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:57.320
I guarantee that you will personally
wipe out homelessness in America.


396
00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.847
- What did you say?
- I want you to return to the ring.


397
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.082
- I don't fight any more.
- But you're the only man


398
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.445
to ever beat the heavyweight champion.

399
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.088
A very long time ago.

400
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:25.439
You can still kick his ass.
He's still susceptible to an overhand right.


401
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.760
I did cold-cock that sucker, didn't I?

402
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.762
Oh, you nailed him! 
You rocked his ass.

403
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.362
Think about it.
This could be the fight of the century.


404
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:38.762
- The fight of the century.
- Hundred years. You.


405
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:43.366
Mm-hm. Yeah. Right, right, right.
Until the next fight of the century. Right?


406
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.920
- Get the fuck outta my chair.
- You're a shrewd man.


407
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.844
Well, if not for yourself, Terry,
do it for the tired, the poor,


408
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:54.764
the teeming masses yearning to breathe free.

409
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.841
- How much do I get?
- $10 million.


410
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.962
And I hire you the best managers
and trainers in the business.


411
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.245
$10 million?

412
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:15.002
- You really think I could take him?
- He's scared shitless of you.


413
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.923
And think of the homeless.

414
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.804
Julio.

415
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.245
Well. You found Terry Conklin, huh?

416
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.127
- Yup.
- Congratulations.


417
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:39.920
Well, now I want the WBI to rank him
in the top ten so I can give him a title shot.


418
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:45.880
Reverend, over the years I have bent
and greased and stretched the rules for you.


419
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:50.600
- I consider myself an artist in this regard.
- You are an artist, Julio.


420
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:55.161
Yes, but even I cannot rank a fighter
who has never had a professional fight!


421
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.844
What'll it take for
you to make this happen?

422
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.524
- I can't do it.
- Money? Sex?


423
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.078
Drugs? Power?

424
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.886
Yeah. Power.

425
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.848
That's what. Yeah. Power.

426
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.404
- Yeah.
- You're fired.


427
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.321
OK. Money, sex and drugs.

428
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.641
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am proud to announce


429
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.403
that 60 days from today,

430
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.800
on March 17, St Patrick's Day,

431
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.643
James "The Grim Reaper" Roper

432
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.005
will defend his heavyweight title

433
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.844
against the No. 8- Ranked
heavyweight contender,


434
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:41.845
according to
the newly released WBI ranking -


435
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:46.560
"Irish" Terry Conklin.

436
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:54.121
- I'm not Irish.
- It's boxing. It just means you're white. Open.


437
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.998
- There he is. There he is.
- "Irish" Terry Conklin.


438
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:04.040
It's a goddamn disgrace. This kid can't fight.
You've sullied the great name of boxing.


439
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.724
Oh, ye of little faith.

440
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.362
This man has been catapulted
into the rankings


441
00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:16.400
by the honorable, estimable, incorruptible
president of World Boxing International,


442
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.084
Mr. Julio Escobar.

443
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.320
And for very good reason.

444
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.765
Name one.

445
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:30.486
- You forget he was an undefeated amateur...
- That's right.


446
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.721
...who knocked out Roper
in the Golden Gloves Championship.


447
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.883
- Knocked him through the ropes.
- I was 17, man. I'd kill Howdy Doody now.


448
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:42.839
Nigger, sit your motherfucking ass down.
I'm trying to...


449
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.807
I think Terry has a few words
he wants to say. Terry, come on.


450
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.722
I would like to start off
by saying thank you to the champ


451
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.519
for giving me this chance to...

452
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.362
Wow, man. Wow.

453
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.246
You're... you're a great champ.

454
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.844
And after I'm done
kicking the champ's butt,


455
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:11.606
I'm gonna donate all of my moneys
to eradicating the homelessness situations,


456
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:16.241
and also the poverty situations
will be eradicated,


457
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.242
in America, and as well as
the United States, forever.


458
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.606
- Thank you very much
and God bless you all.

459
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.921
Got my vote
for Sportsman of the Year already.


460
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:31.524
- Who is this Irish duper?
- Who bought this? Who bought this?


461
00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.845
Who is that? Who is this?

462
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:42.245
- Who do you think will see this debacle?
- It'll be the biggest payday in sports history.


463
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:47.484
- Sultan, the kid's not even a professional.
- Bert, the kid's not even 100 per cent Irish.


464
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:52.405
But how many of you gave Foreman a chance
against Moore? Or Douglas against Tyson?


465
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:56.005
Julio Escobar's a whore on your payroll.

466
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:59.162
- What did you say?
- Keep it legal.


467
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.560
- Did you hear that?
- That's a libelous and racist statement,


468
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.847
- just because Escobar's of Latin descent.
- That's right.


469
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.161
Are you saying something about
brown-skinned people?


470
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:12.447
Do you hate Jews and Negroes as well?

471
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.725
- I am a Jew.
- Then you're an Uncle Tom!


472
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.563
Jews can't be Uncle Toms.

473
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.567
- Sure we can.
- It's a sign of self-loathing.


474
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:27.007
- But you're still my brother.
- I'm not your brother.


475
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.766
Peace.

476
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.842
- Son of a bitch.
- Let's keep it that way.


477
00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.007
Johnny.

478
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.963
Terry?

479
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:47.601
This is the legendary Johnny Windsor.
He's managed many, many of the greats.


480
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.363
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Terry.


481
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:56.241
Eight weeks with me, and you're not only
gonna be a lean, mean killing machine,


482
00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.005
you're gonna be ready for a commission
in the Waffen-SS.


483
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.878
Hate, son, hate! 
The great motivator. Hate.

484
00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:08.168
You're gonna hate Roper, you'll hate me,
you're gonna hate the fucking world.


485
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.083
I hate no man.

486
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.962
Well, do it for the homeless, Terry.

487
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.083
Get changed. We'll start.

488
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.286
Good luck, kid.

489
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.929
Look. All you gotta
do is make him credible.

490
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.729
I can make him credible...
till he gets in the ring.


491
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:32.439
- When the bell rings, he's dog meat.
- Dog meat.


492
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.920
<i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> say I should be arrested.

493
00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.968
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> says the fight's a joke.

494
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.599
<i>Ring Magazine</i> says the fight is a fraud!

495
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.000
Why are they saying these things?

496
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:52.040
- Cos it's the truth.
- The truth needs to be shaped and framed.


497
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.280
Your fucking job!

498
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:59.287
I cannot make caviar out of fish eggs!

499
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.760
Uh, excuse me, Fred. Uh, listen, we...
Hi, Sol. Tough day for you, huh?


500
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.365
We need to get these contracts to Conklin
before he gets a lawyer.


501
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:14.365
I'll hire Conklin's lawyer.
How are the contracts?


502
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.487
I had 'em reviewed by my staff.
Nobody understands anything.


503
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:18.559
Good.

504
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.359
Any interpretation
would lead to endless litigation.


505
00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:27.046
They're vague, indecipherable
and, best of all, they're written in stone.


506
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.121
- I love you.
- Don't you start that.


507
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:33.282
Excuse me. I opened this on accident.
It's yours.


508
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.760
- But you might wanna take a look at it.
- What is this?


509
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.881
Where'd it come from?

510
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.758
Mitchell Kane.
He says he has a lot more of them.


511
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.000
A lot more?

512
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.846
What does he want?

513
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.048
He says he wants a private meeting.
No cameras, no third parties,


514
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.327
just, uh, <i>"mano a mano"</i>
is how he put it.

515
00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.163
<i>"Mano a mano"?</i>

516
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.810
- My dick wants to laugh.
- What is it?


517
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.609
Pictures of nothing, Sol.

518
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.765
You know what? 
I don't need this shit.

519
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.080
I'll be at the pool.

520
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:18.963
I'll finish up these, uh...
these contracts for you.


521
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.883
Arrange a private meeting with Mr. Kane.

522
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.960
Yes, sir.

523
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:40.883
Action. Although our cameras aren't allowed
inside the offices of Rev Fred Sultan,


524
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:46.522
let them record, in the happenchance
that I don't come out alive,


525
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:52.130
that this envelope contains
enough evidence to destroy this man forever.


526
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.525
When I return, if I return,

527
00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.081
the spotlight of truth
will have peered into the depths of evil -


528
00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:05.160
into the soul, if one exists,

529
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.844
of one Fred Sultan.

530
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.808
Kill the camera.

531
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.040
He's ready to see you.

532
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.318
Wish me well.

533
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.241
Cut.

534
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.728
I'll be OK. It's OK.

535
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.725
- I'm really proud of you.
- I'm proud of you.


536
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.166
We'll be here.

537
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.806
Mr. Kane.

538
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.040
Rev Sultan. Here we are.

539
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.325
Yes. <i>Mano a mano.</i>

540
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.886
That's right. Uh, 
I got a lot of pictures.

541
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.528
Uh...

542
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.879
- Uh, Wardell?
- What?


543
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.484
Oh. Um...

544
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.808
I've made many copies of these.

545
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:32.204
So what do you want?

546
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.679
I want to destroy you.

547
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:40.968
I want an exclusive interview,

548
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:47.205
where you'll have to finally answer some of
the tough questions. You're a bad guy, man.


549
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:51.841
You're... you're bad. Even Wardell's
disgusted. But I'm not gonna kiss your feet.


550
00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:55.320
You're a fake, a bully.
I don't like what you do to Girl Scouts.


551
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.607
- That was pretty funny, huh?
- I like you. You have a goal.


552
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:05.084
And you have the balls to reach that goal.
You have a blind, stupid belief in yourself.


553
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:11.166
- Flattery is not gonna work. My course is...
- Oh, no, no, no. I wanna offer you a job.


554
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:16.609
I heard they're gonna do <i>Cops: The Musical.</i>
That could be unreal.


555
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.158
Well, they did it with the...

556
00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.161
Well?

557
00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:31.121
- You OK, boss?
- Never more lucid. Turn on the camera.


558
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.648
Thank you. Thank you, Artie.

559
00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.569
Some said that this upcoming title fight
is built around racism.


560
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:47.678
But is it racism that electrifies people
across the globe?


561
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.648
Or is it a pride in your tribe?

562
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.247
The dimly remembered throb
of drums in the night,


563
00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:56.480
or the white hoarfrost of an early morn

564
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.642
against the gleaming,
sinuous muscle of the jungle night.


565
00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:04.565
You can't do this to me.
I've been Sultan's publicist for 20 years.


566
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.925
Boss says you're gone, you're outta here.

567
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.649
I'll sue you so fast,
you won't know what hit you.


568
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.846
Man, shut up.

569
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.083
Hey.

570
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.479
I got you guys this job!

571
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.561
He's right.

572
00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.523
You better watch your back!

573
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.803
Mitchell, have you sold out?

574
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.767
I'm taking the road less traveled by.

575
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.763
And what happened to,
um, "crusading for the truth"?


576
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:44.128
What is the truth, after all?
History, they say, is written by the winners.


577
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.805
Fuck you, you whore. I quit.

578
00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:49.528
Oh... Vivian.

579
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.999
We can win a Pulitzer.

580
00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.562
- Will you come on?
- Watch this.


581
00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.441
One, please.

582
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.566
Sultan sucks!

583
00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.489
<i>Happy birthday, Mrs. 
Ned Ashton.</i>

584
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:15.926
<i>From me. The other Mrs. 
Ned Ashton.</i>

585
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.319
- What?
- Ooh, snap.


586
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.249
Damn.

587
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.685
Yo, Grim, man.

588
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.479
Hey, check this out, G.
Yo. This is a gift from Sultan.


589
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.959
From Sultan, bro. Damn.

590
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:40.283
- It's your fault, man.
- Well, I'm sorry, man.


591
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:44.249
- You all right, Champ?
- Let me see the ring.


592
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.158
- Damn!
- Damn!


593
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.684
You done came up, Champ.

594
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:58.318
- Wow, that's bigger than the last one, bro.
- No question.


595
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.519
Oh, damn.

596
00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.161
I done got this.

597
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.120
That was a good try, though.
You know I got that one!


598
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.644
I was mad quick, right?

599
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:24.249
- That was bigger than the last one.
- Yo, bro. Let me see that.


600
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.565
- All right, man.
- Kick it in.


601
00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:32.960
Shut up, Irv. Damn. 
Here you go, bro.

602
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.565
- That look nice on you.
- It look all right?


603
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:45.086
It look nice on you.
You done came up like 7 Up, baby.


604
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:47.638
Yeah, it look nice on you, man.

605
00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.849
Real nice on the champ.

606
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.841
Man.

607
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:56.922
- I didn't want it anyway.
- You know you wanted it.


608
00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.001
Shut up.

609
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:06.605
You gotta stop eating this stuff...
and do some roadwork.


610
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.729
Man, I could beat Conklin
and my meat at the same time.


611
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:16.328
- But you got to be in some kinda shape.
- Oh, I'm in shape. I'm round.


612
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:23.040
Mike Tyson was round when he fought Buster
Douglas. Buster KO'd him. You know why?


613
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:28.488
- Cos Tyson wasn't ready to fight.
- Don't worry. When the bell ring, I'm in there.


614
00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.448
<i>Hey, Mr. Chump. I mean, Mr. Champ.</i>

615
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.203
<i>I'd like to reintroduce
you to an old friend.</i>

616
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.406
<i>Mr. Overhand Right.</i>

617
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:14.808
<i>Say, Mr. Roper. When you wake up</i>
<i>in the hospital, realize your belt's gone,</i>


618
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:19.008
<i>come over to my house.</i>
<i>I'll let you try it on sometime, fat boy.</i>


619
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.443
I like this kid.

620
00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:24.079
<i>Hey, Conklin. Ooh! 
There it is.</i>

621
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.486
The Nevada Boxing and Gaming Commission
is pleased to announce


622
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:39.043
the results of the encephalograms performed
on the two contestants in this proposed bout.


623
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:45.080
James Roper's encephalogram
shows no cortical lesions whatsoever.


624
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:50.642
And Mr. Conklin's also shows no, uh...
no significant brain damage.


625
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.367
This bout can proceed as scheduled.

626
00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:03.482
- What's "no significant brain damage"?
- We've not seen Roper in weeks. Why?


627
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:09.042
- He ain't here because he's ducking me.
- He'll be knocked naked from the waist down.


628
00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.724
He wants to continue fighting punks like this.

629
00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.927
It's fixed. If he fights him
he's gonna be crippled and crazy.


630
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.080
Tell him about the deal, will you?

631
00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.684
Why don't you piss off, you fuckin' monkey?

632
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.364
Hey, Mr. French. 
I will bust a cap in your ass.

633
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.487
You? You stunted little dwarf.
Let me fucking get you...


634
00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:29.848
- What do you wanna do? Come on.
- Sit your fat Pavarotti ass out the way.


635
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:35.243
Not me. Him, you silly bastard.

636
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.400
- Terry.
- What's the problem?


637
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:40.800
I ain't got no problem. You do.
I'm gonna whup your white...


638
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:44.041
- You'll have to wait in line for that.
- Fuck waiting in line.


639
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.564
- What's up?
- I'm not gonna scare off.


640
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.767
Tranquillize yourself, will you?

641
00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.604
Look at you. You're scared.
You don't want no part of this, do you?


642
00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:58.047
Go back where you came from
before I rip your fuckin' heart out.


643
00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.769
What you got, Rev? Shit.

644
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:04.047
Supposed to have a fighter here.
You got no one. You got nothing.


645
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.769
Oh, Jesus. Oh.

646
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.168
You ain't shaking, baby.
You're still in. You're in it.


647
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.447
I'm coming back
and I'm gonna get rid of everybody.


648
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:24.201
"One Punch" Terry Conklin, folks.
"One Punch" Terry.


649
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.921
- Fast hands for a white boy.
- We just sold 50,000 tickets.


650
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.604
Now, that's entertainment.

651
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.323
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize

652
00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:40.129
for the behavior of Marvin Shabazz
and his manager.


653
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.678
But if Mr. Shabazz
just shows a little patience,

654
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:46.445
I'm sure Rev Sultan will give him
a title shot at the appropriate time.


655
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.521
Oh, absolutely.

656
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:52.888
We're here to talk about
Roper and Terry Conklin.


657
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.206
Thank you. Thank you. That's right. May I?

658
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:05.239
We have here 100,000 cards and letters,

659
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.480
all for Terry Conklin.

660
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:12.089
Let's pick one out here, can we?
Let's get one of these. Any one at all.


661
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.641
Let's take this one here.
Here I've got, uh... Let's, uh...


662
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.206
Let's see what we got here.

663
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.485
This one is from...

664
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.967
Gosh. It's from a boy named Joey
who's in a wheelchair.


665
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:28.405
Hm. Wheelchair.

666
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:32.244
He says... he says,
"If you become champ, Terry,


667
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:37.802
I'll believe anything is possible,
even walking again. Love, Joey. "


668
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:46.163
I'll tell you, in the cynical age
that we live in, it's, uh...


669
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:52.519
it's rare indeed when someone or something
becomes so transcendent,


670
00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.965
as... as Terry and this fight have become.

671
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.799
Kane.

672
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.760
Kane.

673
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.399
What are you doing?
What are you hiding for?


674
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.560
Enjoying your job?

675
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.447
Don't...

676
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:24.521
I'm sorr...

677
00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.920
I don't know how to tell you this,
but you, um...


678
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:33.922
You smell. You stink a little bit.

679
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:37.923
Well, they took away my suite.
After 20 years, like that.


680
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:42.283
- You gotta protect yourself.
- Uh-huh. You know, I'm not...


681
00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.838
Listen, please. Listen.

682
00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:49.399
The Sultan is ripe for a fall.
Do you understand?


683
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:53.244
Everybody in the organization
is fed up with him. It's not just me.


684
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.242
We've been waiting
for a new leader to emerge. It's you.


685
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.446
I see. So I'm the, uh...

686
00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:03.126
You take over his organization
and you get me my job back.


687
00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:06.125
God sent you.

688
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.568
Are you OK? Where are you going?

689
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.403
Going to take a sponge bath.

690
00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:20.009
- Take it... take it easy.
- I will.


691
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:23.560
Hey, Siegfried. 
Who's that behind... Who?

692
00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:26.879
Come on. That isn't funny.

693
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:50.128
I'm not Irish. 
I'm not Irish.

694
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:32.124
You're a stallion.
You're a fucking stallion.


695
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:34.921
Terry Conklin.

696
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.521
Stay down, boy.

697
00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:04.206
Told you to stay down.

698
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:10.765
- How do you like Las Vegas, Terry?
- What's that?


699
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.318
How does it compare to Cleveland?

700
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:18.200
Cleveland's a real city full of real people
not concerned with bourgeois attitudes,


701
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:24.729
concerted sexism, racism, religiousism
or any of the other -isms that Vegas is about.


702
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:28.120
Las Vegas is one of the most
exploitive places I've seen in my life.


703
00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:32.488
Particularly towards women. I've never
been to a city more exploitive to women.


704
00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:36.643
It makes me sick and
I can't wait to go home.

705
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:40.200
But wasn't that you
on the cover of <i>Playboy</i> magazine?


706
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.565
What's that?

707
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.483
Yeah, that was me, but
let me say two things.

708
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:48.960
One - I hated it.
And two - that's not what I'm about.


709
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:52.686
- How's Champ looking?
- Good. Did you see him out there?


710
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.648
- Uh, no. We can't get in to...
- Was a great workout.


711
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.205
<i>You should've seen the workout today.</i>
<i>He's looking excellent.</i>


712
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:21.125
<i>So, um... what about all</i>
<i>these reports of all this room service?</i>


713
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:27.649
<i>Ten gallons of ice cream, a carton of</i>
<i>gummy bears, all the pork skins in Vegas?</i>


714
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:30.608
<i>Champ has an entourage.</i>
<i>He feeds 'em.</i>


715
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.329
<i>He's not eating any of this stuff?</i>

716
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:39.042
<i>Even if he were not in perfect</i>
<i>condition, he's still a professional fighter.</i>


717
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:42.839
<i>He's got savvy.</i>
<i>He knows how to breathe in a ring.</i>


718
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:47.722
Is racism driving this fight?
I don't think so.


719
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:50.365
$2 on "Irish" Terry.

720
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:59.646
Are we exploiting a history of divisive racial
struggle in this country? I don't think so.


721
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:02.684
Two bucks on the clean-cut white boy.

722
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:06.001
Please. Thank you.

723
00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:09.366
To play the piano,
you need the black keys...

724
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:11.725
And the white keys.

725
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:15.769
Doing a rock opera for homeless
about the situation in Cleveland.


726
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:19.479
I think it's applicable universally
to the homeless


727
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:22.482
in this situation
in any major American market.


728
00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:27.724
For example, South Dakota
there's a homelessness situation.


729
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:32.838
Conklin's been getting a lot of publicity
about his donations to the homeless.


730
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:36.286
- That's his thing.
- You're not known for your acts of charity.


731
00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:40.727
Ain't nobody's business
what I do with my money.


732
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:45.281
We've found that you've given large
donations of money to a number of places.


733
00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:50.444
AIDS organizations, multiple sclerosis.
You visit children's hospitals in every town.


734
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:54.205
I'm about to donate to the "Remove My Foot
From Your Ass" Foundation.


735
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:57.202
I tell you,
I don't want to talk about this. It's over.


736
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:59.485
You're quite a rock'n'roller.

737
00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:02.084
I still am quite a rock'n'roller.
Thanks for that.


738
00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.126
Without further objections,

739
00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:09.762
I would like to sing my song,
that I've just been working on, to Mr. Roper.


740
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:11.966
- Would that be all right?
- Yeah.


741
00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:14.848
It's called "Mr. Roper, Mr. Roper".

742
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:44.648
"Mr. Roper, Mr. Roper".

743
00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:52.520
You just wanna blow this fight, don't you?

744
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:58.088
Just chill. My blackness'll beat that kid.

745
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.121
Mr. Roper.

746
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:30.727
- He looks good. He looks good.
- Yeah. Looks is what counts, isn't it?


747
00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:34.564
Hey, hey. Now... you know,
if he wins, have you thought about...


748
00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.641
Wins?

749
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:40.487
Oh, man. Yeah.

750
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:45.041
If he wins, what are your plans after that?
Have you thought about that?


751
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:48.440
Like, are you happy
with your deal with Sultan?


752
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.441
Happy?

753
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:54.000
I'd sooner be turked by a syphilitic bear.

754
00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:57.286
T... Tur...

755
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:59.326
Turked? What is turked?

756
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.480
Rectally relieved.

757
00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:04.042
Oh, jeez.

758
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:10.569
So, what? After... after this fight you'd
consider signing with another promoter or...?


759
00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:14.279
Or a smart younger man such as yourself?

760
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:17.925
I don't like to
toot my own horn, but...

761
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:21.207
- Is that what you're saying?
- Well...


762
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:23.767
Terry.

763
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.525
Terry! Get over here.

764
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:35.167
- What's up, Johnny?
- We may have found a great white hope.


765
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:39.762
- He wants to promote you.
- Who? You?


766
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.806
Yeah, maybe so.

767
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.802
- What about Mr. Sultan?
- Uh...


768
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:48.519
Mr. Sultan. You know...
Not so good for you guys.


769
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.886
He's... he's...
He'll get what he needs.


770
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:55.804
Let me ask you a question.
Do you covet racism?


771
00:58:55.890 --> 00:59:00.088
- Do I covet racism? How do you mean?
- Are you a racist person?


772
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:05.164
- No, I'm not.
- I am fed up with the racism in this business.


773
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.969
- Johnny?
- Too much of it.


774
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:11.008
No, really, I believe that.

775
00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:12.887
Wow.

776
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:16.609
Wow. Gosh.

777
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.645
Could I have a hug?

778
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:21.721
Sure. Sure.

779
00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:24.759
Whoa!

780
00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:28.249
Introducing...

781
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:33.085
the most popular heavyweight
since Muhammad Ali...


782
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:36.207
"Irish" Terry Conklin.

783
01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:07.280
The challenger... The challenger weighs in
at official 202Â¼ pounds.


784
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:19.844
- I would just like to say that I love you all.
- We love you, man!


785
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:24.287
I truly do. And tomorrow marks
the beginning of my personal quest


786
01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.726
for the eradication of
the homelessness situation in America.


787
01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:31.325
I am a fighter of destiny
and I'm going to shock the world.


788
01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:33.878
God bless America!

789
01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:39.648
Terry! Terry! Terry!

790
01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.005
- You hear that?
- That shit don't faze me.


791
01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:49.240
And now...

792
01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:57.010
introducing the undefeated, undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world...


793
01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:00.719
James "The Grim Reaper" Roper.

794
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:31.409
He looks like shit.

795
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:34.721
Roper looks at least 220.
He's been eating chitlins.


796
01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:38.485
The champion weighs an official...

797
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.038
238 pounds.

798
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:46.328
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

799
01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:51.404
The champ... The champ has a few words
he wants to say to y'all.


800
01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:55.408
Yeah. I just want to
say that after 38 fights,

801
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.924
38 wins by knockout,

802
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:01.047
this is all the love you show me?

803
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:05.567
Well, the rest of you can kiss my big,
black, bloated, Rolls-Royce-driving ass.


804
01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:07.845
Gimme my robe.

805
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:24.687
I wanna thank you all
for coming out here today,


806
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:27.648
and I want you to
ask yourself the question -

807
01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.961
is it hope? Or is it hype?

808
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.087
We'll find out the answer tomorrow night.

809
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:37.207
See you at the MGM Grand. Thank you.

810
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.006
I love this outfit. 
Is that a unitard?

811
01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:03.399
Mitchell. Great news.

812
01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:07.881
The gate went over 110 million today.
By fight time tomorrow, it should be 125.


813
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:11.121
Ooh. I bow to you. 
I sit at your feet.

814
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:14.282
This has been a brilliant partnership.

815
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:17.442
I hope it's the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.


816
01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:20.124
The beginning...

817
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:24.601
- Hey, baby, you feeling all right?
- Oh. Baby, listen, I'm, uh...


818
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:30.242
I'm concerned that the champ is maybe
too far gone to beat this Conklin kid.


819
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:35.040
No fucking way the champ loses this fight.
He's gonna kill this kid.


820
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:39.089
- He's got that tummy.
- You're starting to believe your own bullshit.


821
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:42.207
Relax. Fight's a lock.

822
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:46.203
You would know.
You're the paisley Pooh-Bah.


823
01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:50.601
Look.

824
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:56.528
Champ and I have our little disagreements.
Hell, my whole organization does.


825
01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:01.047
Bottom line: He loves me, they love me,

826
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.008
and I love him, and I love them.

827
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:08.284
You know what else?

828
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:10.361
What's that?

829
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:18.164
I love you.

830
01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:27.086
Very clever. Gotta get one of those.

831
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:29.206
You're my brother.

832
01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:31.884
From the brother of brothers.

833
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:52.687
There is no excitement like
a much-anticipated heavyweight title fight.


834
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:58.163
And the fervor charts go off the wall
when the challenger is...


835
01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:02.084
- White. There, I've said it. White.
- I'm glad you said it, Stu.


836
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:24.327
Roper is a jungle animal. He wants to do
unspeakable things to your mother and sister.


837
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:29.928
Johnny. You do not have to whip me
into a racist frenzy to beat this man.


838
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.968
- We all know you're a racist bastard.
- Me, a racist?


839
01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:35.848
- You're a pig.
- I'm not a racist. I'm an Englishman.


840
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:40.401
The fairest people on the planet.
If I was a racist, I wouldn't be training you.


841
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:44.199
You stupid muck-shoveling Mick.
Now, what we got here, then, Paddy? Eh?


842
01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:46.850
White gloves.

843
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:49.398
- You disgust me.
- Mm.


844
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:52.402
No, Terry, no. 
That's a good idea.

845
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.765
You should do it. Nice touch.

846
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.159
Wait a second.

847
01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:02.839
- Let... let me tell you something.
- Come on, boys, out now.


848
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:09.849
You think this is all just a big joke, right?
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.


849
01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:14.765
You think the public's just fallen in love
with me because of the color of my skin?


850
01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:17.489
Huh. Yeah...

851
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:22.282
Because I'm fresh and good-looking?

852
01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:26.280
Shame on you.

853
01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:30.727
I am more than hope.
And I'm a hell of a lot more than hype.


854
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.200
I'm a young man in fantastic shape

855
01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.850
with a devastating overhand right

856
01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:39.603
that is going to shock the world.

857
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:44.485
Don't you forget, 
I never lost a fight.

858
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:47.490
Attaboy, Terry! 
You kick his black ass.

859
01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.358
It is the ass
of a human being, man!

860
01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:54.005
A human being.

861
01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:57.048
That is the ass
that I'm gonna kick tonight.

862
01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:00.122
- I love you, Terry.
- I love you, too.


863
01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:03.566
<i>Is that a circus entrance?</i>
<i>A fighter coming in, or a clown?</i>


864
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:08.849
- <i>The guy thinks this is a rock concert.</i>
- <i>Maybe we're in the wrong place and it is.</i>


865
01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:38.364
<i>None of the experts give this kid</i>
<i>a chance. Yet can 100 million fans be wrong?</i>


866
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:42.284
If Conklin had started earlier in his career,
would he be the champion?


867
01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:48.366
If Roper had fought somebody as good as
Conklin, would he be the champion today?


868
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:53.198
As we watch
the challenger dance in the ring,


869
01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.680
it's obvious the champion
is delaying his entrance to the arena.


870
01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:01.685
I'm just thinking. Is he trying psychologically
to toy with the mind of the challenger?


871
01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:06.603
Will y'all back off?
I'm trying to watch the show.


872
01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:10.603
- <i>You're under arrest.</i>
- <i>You gonna have to take me!</i>


873
01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:20.198
Cut that junk off and get rid of that cigarette.
You got a fight out there.


874
01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:23.965
Man, this is <i>Dolemite.</i>
My inspiration tape, OK?


875
01:09:33.570 --> 01:09:38.086
I'm trying to tell you, this is
the No. 1 contender here. Recognize, will you?


876
01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:41.162
I'm saying we up in here
and he needs to be in the ring.


877
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:45.368
- Hey, hey, Shabazz. How are you doing?
- You gonna talk to me like you know me?


878
01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:49.329
You disrespect me cos you threw
a sucker punch? I'll show your white ass.


879
01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:53.198
Why don't you go home
and learn to speak English, you bastard?


880
01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.487
El, man, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you.


881
01:09:56.570 --> 01:10:00.199
Come here. No, no. Look at me.
I'm right here. Look this way. Come on.


882
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:05.125
- Come on, man. You got work to do.
- Wait till after the love scene.


883
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:23.160
The champion has still not come in.
Conklin seems bewildered.


884
01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:28.119
He just keeps circling around. He could get
tired. Stu, could there be anything wrong?


885
01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:32.328
I'll tell you what it is, Johnny.
The boy is scared of me. He's scared of me.


886
01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:36.085
That's a possibility.
But, just in case, don't get him mad, eh?


887
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:39.207
I'm telling you what. 
He's scared of me.

888
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:40.518
Roper?

889
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.680
Hey, Roper, you scared of me?

890
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:45.079
Huh, boy? Roper.

891
01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.569
Oh, yeah, he's scared of me.

892
01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:50.199
I said, Roper's scared of me!
He's scared of me.


893
01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:52.724
Come on, now. Come on, Roper.

894
01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:56.086
Come and kick some butt with me.
Come and catch the bumblebee.


895
01:10:56.170 --> 01:11:01.198
Kiss the donkey, son. Kiss the mule.
I'm gonna make him kiss the donkey, ref.


896
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:04.327
He gonna kiss the donkey.
He gonna smooch with the donkey.


897
01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:06.446
I'm gonna bust him up. Bust him up.

898
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:10.000
Time for the comeuppance, yes.
Time for the comeuppance, yeah!


899
01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:13.844
<i>You rat-soup-eating honky motherfucker!</i>

900
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.321
OK.

901
01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.641
Now I'm mad.

902
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:27.967
Irv!

903
01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:34.879
May the Lord bless you.
May the Spirit guide you.


904
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:40.124
And may the heavens rain down
their bounty upon you. May the...


905
01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:42.849
Nigger, grow up.

906
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:14.682
All right, baby. Big payday. Go for it.

907
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:19.002
Let's see your glove, Champ.
Looks good to me.


908
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:34.530
Hey, Bambi.
Don't distract the champ with that.


909
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:38.364
Vincent, how are you doing, baby?
You seen Jules? How's everything?


910
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:41.362
Good to see you.
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch. Sit here.


911
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:45.125
Julio, get up, get up.
Come on, come on, come on. Sit.


912
01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:47.929
- Best seat in the house right here.
- There we go.


913
01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:51.639
As Roper finally enters the ring,
you know, it's hard to imagine


914
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:55.405
how a popular champion could become
so unpopular in such a short time.


915
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:59.119
The other story is the 20 pounds
this guy's carrying. How can he come in?


916
01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:02.919
Look at the belly hanging over his trunks.
That's a disgrace.


917
01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:05.319
The guy never met
a meal he didn't like.

918
01:14:05.410 --> 01:14:09.244
This is where the action is. Seeing
as how these are the last few moments


919
01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:12.367
of the Sultanic era of boxing.

920
01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:14.839
What the fuck are you talking about?

921
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.444
The new heavyweight champ of the world,

922
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:20.602
Terry Conklin, has signed with me.

923
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:26.325
- We'll see about that shit.
- Yes, we will.


924
01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:31.846
All right, guys. I gave you instructions
in the dressing room. Is there any questions?


925
01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:34.444
- Yes, sir. I have one question.
- What?


926
01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:38.523
Well, I was just, uh...
I was just wondering up there to Mr. Roper.


927
01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:43.889
What do you think it's gonna feel like
to lose to an amateur, chump?


928
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:48.168
Shut up and let your fists do the talking.
Shake hands and good luck.


929
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.003
Good luck, fat boy.

930
01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:56.965
- Am I that fat?
- Nah. Just a whole lot of man.


931
01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:03.967
Terry, listen to me. Do this for the white race.
You may be Irish, but they're almost white.


932
01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:09.602
Johnny, I'm ignoring your racism.
This one's for the homeless.


933
01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:12.523
All right. Now, use your head.
Have a good fight.


934
01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:16.649
The tension is building, and it feels
like we're going to have a meltdown.


935
01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:20.245
And here we go for the heavyweight
championship of the world.


936
01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:22.560
Time.

937
01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:55.680
Here we go. Here we
go. Do the work, Champ.

938
01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:58.962
Do it.

939
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.566
No holding.

940
01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:12.403
Watch your head.
Watch your head. Punch and get out.


941
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:15.243
- Get outta there. Punch him.
- I'm playing with him.


942
01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:19.164
- Turn him loose and fight.
- I've got him right where I want him.


943
01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:25.681
Come on, fat boy.

944
01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:29.240
Watch that overhand right.

945
01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:55.730
Champ's pissed off now.

946
01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:00.606
- Look out.
- Look at this. Look at this.


947
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:27.402
Oh, yes! Yes!

948
01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:29.799
You nailed him.

949
01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:34.684
Terry, get up!

950
01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:42.523
He's out.

951
01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:56.646
And it's over. It is over.

952
01:17:56.730 --> 01:17:59.449
Man, this wasn't a fight,
this was an execution.


953
01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:03.887
That's it? What the hell
is this microwave-fight bullshit?


954
01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:06.723
That's what we talking about.

955
01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.801
All right!

956
01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:14.918
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


957
01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:18.806
- We reap what we sow.
- We reap what we sow. Yes, Mitch. Yes.


958
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:21.643
Yes, we do.

959
01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.039
"We reap what we sow. "

960
01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:28.442
Guess that's kinda like,
"Close cover before striking. "


961
01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:31.169
Sit down, mate. Sit down.
It's fine. It's fine.


962
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:33.764
- How are you doing?
- Where's my mintage?


963
01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:36.410
He's on Queer Street. Listen.

964
01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:39.721
If anybody talks to you
or starts talking rematch...


965
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:44.520
No rematch. No rematch. I'm going back
to Cleveland, gonna play rock'n'roll, man.


966
01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:48.842
That's right. Listen, the best thing to do
with this crowd is just to walk away.


967
01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:51.160
See you around. Good.

968
01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:54.208
Now, take it easy.
Come on. Take it easy.

969
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:56.645
You know what you need in rock'n'roll?

970
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.925
Management.

971
01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:01.763
I just had a... just had a...

972
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:04.000
You're woozy. You're woozy. Um...

973
01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:06.968
I wanted to put a bee in your bonnet.
We'll talk later.


974
01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:09.689
- Getting up.
- All right, man.


975
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:13.604
- Hey. You knocked him cold. I love it!
- Way to kick that ass!


976
01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:17.444
- Get Champ some peanut-butter ice cream.
- Spread it all over the girls.


977
01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:20.727
- Champion-rolla!
- Who are you?


978
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:23.119
Peter Prince.

979
01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:27.283
- I own the place.
- I know who you are, man.


980
01:19:27.370 --> 01:19:28.359
Oh, my bad.

981
01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:30.009
How'd we do?

982
01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:35.483
Pay-per-view, through the roof. $132 million
gate. That's a lot of fucking money.


983
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:40.439
- We haven't even counted the gate here yet.
- Wait till we box up the videos.


984
01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:44.443
- We weren't gonna pay Conklin.
- That's what I'm saying.


985
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:48.159
Hold up, Sultan. We need to talk.
We had a deal. You need to respect that.


986
01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:51.162
And what's up with that outfit?
You Ali Baba Jackson?


987
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:54.640
- Oh, not this nigger.
- Eh, eh, eh, eh. Easy, frosty man.


988
01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:59.042
Ruk'n, I'm tired of you and the grinch
that stole blackness stealing my glory.


989
01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:01.928
Nobody's stealing your glory.
You're a disgrace.


990
01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:06.208
He look like a half-sucked Milk Dud, I swear.
Boy, you're sorry. What you wanna do?


991
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:08.804
Isaac Hayes said he want his head back.
What's up?


992
01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:13.042
- It's good publicity for the next fight.
- No, Rev. Every time I have a moment,


993
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:15.849
- they come to ruin it.
- Stop talking and step to me.


994
01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:18.842
- You've fought nobody. Step to me.
- This shit stop now.


995
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:21.683
- Come over here. What do you want?
- You.


996
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:26.002
- I'm $132 million strong.
- Why you act like you wanna do something?


997
01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:29.685
Didn't I tell you you're gonna get the shot?
Didn't I tell you that?


998
01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:33.763
Man, hey, look, nobody's putting your...
You ain't my daddy. Are you?


999
01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:38.082
My nerves is bad anyway.
If I can get this motherfucker out...


1000
01:20:39.970 --> 01:20:42.359
It's a gun. He's got a gun. 
He's got a gun.

1001
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:45.647
That's what I'm saying.
I'll do a walk-by up in here.


1002
01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:49.086
- Who the champ now?
- You the champ. I'm running with you.


1003
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:55.086
My nerves is bad, I've been on medication,
and I just want some respect. Will you?


1004
01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:03.682
I've never seen a championship fight
after a championship fight. Incredible.


1005
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:09.766
- There's a second fight going on right now.
- God! Don't give away what we can sell.


1006
01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:23.570
Damn.

1007
01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:26.039
You all right, Champ?

1008
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:33.565
That's all you got for me? Huh?
Who's the champ? Who's the champ?


1009
01:21:33.650 --> 01:21:36.642
I am. Next time I'll break
my foot off in your ass.


1010
01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:41.440
You have just seen a preview
of the marvelous fight to come


1011
01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:47.719
between "Malevolent" Marvin Shabazz
and James "The Grim Reaper" Roper.


1012
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:50.449
This is the beauty of America.

1013
01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:53.761
May the best man win. I love it!

1014
01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:56.239
And I love you.
