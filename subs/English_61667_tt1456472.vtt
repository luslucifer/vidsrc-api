1
00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:39.703
Just a moment!

2
00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:02.642
Here's the Archbishop of Palermo
Saverio Cincotta.


3
00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.103
This is his third Conclave.

4
00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:08.023
Cardinal Masao Takada...

5
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.151
archivist and librarian
of the Holy Roman Church.


6
00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:15.155
We can see Sidi Kamara,
followed by Koma Mbosou.


7
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.659
As you know the African continent
has never... Here's Ricardo Aguilar.


8
00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:22.788
Who could be
the first South American Pope.


9
00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:26.041
And the cardinal from Sri Lanka,
Don Somasiry.


10
00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:30.879
We'll try approaching
Cardinal Massucci for a word.


11
00:04:30.922 --> 00:04:34.424
Cardinal, could we have a statement?

12
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.428
Obviously they can't
answer our questions.


13
00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:44.059
And now, we can see
the Syrian Patriarch of Antioch...


14
00:04:44.143 --> 00:04:48.438
Simon Al Shuriani, Prefect of the
Congregation of Eastern Churches.


15
00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:50.816
Here's who we're all waiting for:

16
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.444
The Vatican spokesman,
Marcin Rajski is approaching us...


17
00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.823
- maybe to ask us.
- Thank you very much.


18
00:04:57.907 --> 00:05:01.785
- We must ask you to leave now.
- He asks us to leave...


19
00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:03.703
but thanks the press.

20
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.582
- Maybe a long shot of the Sistine Chapel.
- No, thank you.


21
00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:11.795
He thanks us very much...

22
00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:16.341
but our work ends here.
We can't get that shot.


23
00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:19.344
Here, we know them all,
Cardinal Dean Gregori...


24
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.972
the favored of the Conclave.

25
00:05:22.098 --> 00:05:26.852
As of this moment
the 108 cardinal electors...


26
00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:30.981
will be isolated from
the rest of the world.


27
00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:23.492
Gregori, what do we do?

28
00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:26.411
- Has the power failed?
- What else could it be?


29
00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:30.499
- Please, stay calm.
- Any candles?


30
00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:34.794
- They're not allowed. - Why?
- They ruin the frescoes.


31
00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.797
Do they know outside
that we're in darkness?


32
00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:41.051
Of course they do...

33
00:06:41.177 --> 00:06:44.804
and they're already fixing it.

34
00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:49.559
- Who's that? What happened?
- It's Cardinal Brummer.


35
00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:51.561
I fell.

36
00:06:51.687 --> 00:06:55.190
It's nothing, I'm already getting up.

37
00:06:55.274 --> 00:06:56.942
- Are you alright?
- Yes, thank you.


38
00:06:57.068 --> 00:06:59.069
- Is everything alright?
- I said: Yes!


39
00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:00.904
Are you okay, Brummer?

40
00:07:00.947 --> 00:07:04.324
- I didn't hurt myself.
- Your back, ankle?


41
00:07:04.408 --> 00:07:08.453
- I'm not hurt at all!
- Are you sure?


42
00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.081
Please, try not to move around.

43
00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.919
Let's return to our seats.

44
00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:19.839
Pick things up...

45
00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:38.376
Not me, Lord, not me!

46
00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:45.175
Not me, Lord, don't choose me!

47
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.511
I'm not up to it.

48
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.016
Not me, Lord, please.

49
00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:54.934
Not me.

50
00:08:55.061 --> 00:08:57.937
Not me, Lord, please.

51
00:08:58.064 --> 00:09:00.940
Not me, Lord.

52
00:09:11.452 --> 00:09:13.953
No, I said no!

53
00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:41.314
Gregori.

54
00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:43.233
Bikila.

55
00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:46.236
Aguilar.

56
00:09:48.114 --> 00:09:48.658
Gregori.

57
00:09:57.248 --> 00:10:00.500
- Where does Gregori stand?
- 13.


58
00:10:00.584 --> 00:10:02.627
Gregori 18, Bikila 11.

59
00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:05.839
- Bikila.
- Gregori 21.


60
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:08.883
- Aguilar 18.
- Gregori and Bikila 15.


61
00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:10.760
Bikila.

62
00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:16.349
- Aguilar.
- Just a moment!


63
00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:18.143
Gregori.

64
00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:19.644
Lucci.

65
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.398
The smoke's black,
the Pope still hasn't been elected.


66
00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:25.984
The smoke is white!

67
00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:29.028
The thousands of faithful here
in St. Peter's Square...


68
00:10:29.113 --> 00:10:32.365
joyfully applaud the news.

69
00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:35.785
But the bells aren't ringing.

70
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.873
Maybe the smoke only looked white.

71
00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:43.001
I can hear my colleagues
saying the smoke is black.


72
00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:47.130
The smoke, actually...

73
00:10:47.882 --> 00:10:51.009
Yes, the smoke is black.

74
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:53.303
Yes, it's black, nothing doing.

75
00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:57.182
The smoke will last a while
because, as well as the ballots...


76
00:10:57.308 --> 00:11:01.186
their personal notes
will be burned too.


77
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.148
Nothing regarding the Conclave
can filter through to the outside.


78
00:11:08.194 --> 00:11:10.153
Aguilar.

79
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:13.573
Gregori.

80
00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:15.450
Lucci.

81
00:11:17.953 --> 00:11:19.287
Bikila.

82
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.457
Another black smoke signal.

83
00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:26.711
The cardinals in the Conclave still
haven't managed to elect a Pope.


84
00:11:26.796 --> 00:11:29.923
A second vote will be cast
this afternoon.


85
00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:34.719
We don't know if the favorites are
still Gregori, Aguilar and Bikila.


86
00:12:06.752 --> 00:12:07.364
Melville.

87
00:12:34.864 --> 00:12:36.489
Aguilar.

88
00:12:37.408 --> 00:12:38.020
Melville.

89
00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:46.749
Cevasco.

90
00:12:47.918 --> 00:12:48.530
Melville.

91
00:12:53.757 --> 00:12:55.758
Aguilar.

92
00:12:56.927 --> 00:12:57.539
Melville.

93
00:13:22.453 --> 00:13:23.953
Aguilar.

94
00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:27.832
Melville.

95
00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:02.742
Do you accept your canonical election
as Supreme Pontiff.


96
00:14:10.709 --> 00:14:15.588
Do you accept your canonical election
as Supreme Pontiff?


97
00:14:39.905 --> 00:14:40.405
Yes.

98
00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:57.315
- Holiness...
- What are you doing?


99
00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:04.363
- What happens now?
- You can just give a blessing...


100
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:11.245
or, as our deceased
beloved Pope did the first time...


101
00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:15.333
address the faithful with a speech.

102
00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:33.518
Dear brothers and sisters...

103
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:03.422
Nuntio vobis gaudium magnum,
habemus Papam!


104
00:17:10.806 --> 00:17:14.809
Eminentissimum ac reverendissimum...

105
00:17:48.093 --> 00:17:50.052
Help me.

106
00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:54.849
I can't do this.

107
00:17:56.852 --> 00:17:59.103
I can't do this!

108
00:19:56.722 --> 00:20:02.059
Holy Father...

109
00:20:02.978 --> 00:20:05.479
you mustn't worry.

110
00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:09.984
By bestowing this charge, God also
gives you help to accomplish it...


111
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:15.489
and the strength to sustain the
weight of this great responsibility.


112
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.619
Would you like something hot?
Herbal tea?


113
00:20:23.248 --> 00:20:26.459
You could retire to your apartments...

114
00:20:26.501 --> 00:20:29.962
and when you're ready,
I'll take you to the balcony.


115
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:34.383
No.

116
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.603
The Conclave has indeed
elected the Holy Father...


117
00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:50.024
who, aware
of this great responsibility...


118
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.153
feels the need to retire in prayer.

119
00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:58.783
This unusual gesture
is also an act of humility...


120
00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:03.245
which we are sure
you will want to respect.


121
00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:05.039
Please.

122
00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:10.628
I believe I express the sentiments
of my colleagues worldwide.


123
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.048
We respect His Holiness' will...

124
00:21:14.132 --> 00:21:18.177
all we ask is his name. Only that!

125
00:21:18.261 --> 00:21:20.429
Tell us if it's one of these 8.

126
00:21:20.514 --> 00:21:23.307
Aguilar? Gregori?

127
00:21:23.433 --> 00:21:27.144
- Bikila? - We believe...
- Todorov?


128
00:21:27.187 --> 00:21:30.272
We believe within a few hours...

129
00:21:30.315 --> 00:21:35.277
the Pontiff will introduce himself
to the faithful from the balcony.


130
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.696
At that point you also will meet him...

131
00:21:37.823 --> 00:21:42.410
and we will celebrate
the new Pontificate together.


132
00:21:42.452 --> 00:21:44.203
Thank you.

133
00:23:32.437 --> 00:23:35.022
- Do you feel any pain?
- No.


134
00:23:39.569 --> 00:23:42.071
- Headache?
- Yes... no.


135
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.165
How is your blood pressure usually?

136
00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:02.466
- Good.
- I was sure.


137
00:24:03.468 --> 00:24:05.844
I was sure.

138
00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:12.851
- Good morning!
- Good morning!


139
00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:14.979
Good day!

140
00:24:15.063 --> 00:24:17.064
Good morning!

141
00:24:18.191 --> 00:24:22.611
We're going to Borgo Pio
for breakfast.


142
00:24:25.448 --> 00:24:26.991
What?

143
00:24:27.117 --> 00:24:34.456
There's a place where they make
delicious cream-filled doughnuts.


144
00:24:34.499 --> 00:24:38.836
Then I'd like to take them
to the Quirinale Museum.


145
00:24:38.878 --> 00:24:42.006
There's a wonderful
Caravaggio exhibit.


146
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.758
I don't think you can.

147
00:24:44.884 --> 00:24:48.762
Why not? Our task is done.

148
00:24:48.847 --> 00:24:54.143
How could you think
of leaving the Vatican at this time?


149
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:58.897
The Holy Father will recover very soon
and we must be at his side!


150
00:24:58.982 --> 00:25:02.484
Yes, but we won't go far.

151
00:25:02.527 --> 00:25:07.281
We'll take our cell phones,
so you can contact us at any time.


152
00:25:07.407 --> 00:25:10.534
I'd like to remind you
of John Paul the First's precedent...


153
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.662
who, after his election and
appearance on the balcony...


154
00:25:13.788 --> 00:25:16.540
made us stay an extra day.

155
00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:18.375
Here it is.

156
00:25:18.418 --> 00:25:20.169
Alright, if it's only for a day...

157
00:25:20.295 --> 00:25:23.631
No cardinal shall have
contact with the outside...


158
00:25:23.673 --> 00:25:26.800
until the election is over...

159
00:25:26.926 --> 00:25:29.428
and publicly announced.

160
00:25:33.683 --> 00:25:37.144
Could I at least get a cappuccino?
Not too hot!


161
00:25:38.813 --> 00:25:43.025
- What will we have?
- Orange juice.


162
00:25:44.903 --> 00:25:47.446
A cappuccino, very little froth.

163
00:26:05.048 --> 00:26:09.093
The Holy Father
has been seen by a physician...


164
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:12.596
who said
he's in good physical condition.


165
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:14.973
But the Holy Father isn't improving.

166
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.561
Given the gravity of the situation...

167
00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:21.814
the cardinals
said they're in favor of...


168
00:26:21.856 --> 00:26:24.358
Professor Brezzi,
may I present Cardinal Gregori.


169
00:26:24.484 --> 00:26:28.570
I know you, your picture
was in the papers.


170
00:26:28.613 --> 00:26:30.614
He was the front-runner, right?

171
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:36.370
The cardinals are in favor
of trying psychoanalysis...


172
00:26:36.496 --> 00:26:41.250
despite the natural skepticism you can
well imagine. - Yes, I can imagine.


173
00:26:41.334 --> 00:26:47.131
I think it's unnecessary to remind you...

174
00:26:47.215 --> 00:26:52.720
- the concepts of soul and subconscious cannot possibly co-exist.
- Okay, we'll see.


175
00:26:52.762 --> 00:26:56.849
What's his name?
I don't recognize him.


176
00:26:56.891 --> 00:26:59.643
Who did you elect? 
What's his name?

177
00:26:59.728 --> 00:27:03.522
- Call him Holiness.
- It's a little too much!


178
00:27:03.648 --> 00:27:09.528
In a therapeutic situation,
a name can give life...


179
00:27:09.654 --> 00:27:11.488
to the relationship...

180
00:27:11.531 --> 00:27:15.409
Okay, it doesn't matter,
we cannot know his name.


181
00:27:15.493 --> 00:27:18.036
I'm off, I'll leave the two of you.

182
00:27:18.163 --> 00:27:21.790
- Where can the Pope and I meet?
- Here.


183
00:27:23.668 --> 00:27:26.170
Good morning.

184
00:27:26.254 --> 00:27:30.549
- How do you feel?
- I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.


185
00:27:30.675 --> 00:27:33.260
Don't worry.

186
00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:35.304
Fine, we'll begin now.

187
00:27:35.388 --> 00:27:38.056
Thank you all!

188
00:27:46.024 --> 00:27:48.192
Right...

189
00:27:48.318 --> 00:27:49.943
well...

190
00:27:52.155 --> 00:27:55.449
All that's happened recently...

191
00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:58.327
your election and everything...

192
00:27:58.453 --> 00:28:01.830
we'll lay it aside for the moment.

193
00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:07.044
I'd like us to begin with retracing...

194
00:28:07.086 --> 00:28:09.922
reliving your emotions...

195
00:28:09.964 --> 00:28:12.090
Wait.

196
00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:18.222
- I suppose I can't ask...
- Absolutely not.


197
00:28:18.306 --> 00:28:21.308
I was sure that anything about sex.

198
00:28:21.351 --> 00:28:23.435
A mention of his mother?

199
00:28:23.478 --> 00:28:27.981
Right now, it might reawaken
distant episodes, memories.


200
00:28:28.066 --> 00:28:30.108
- Exactly.
- Exactly?


201
00:28:30.193 --> 00:28:31.485
No.

202
00:28:31.611 --> 00:28:36.698
And what about facing unfulfilled
fantasies and desires?


203
00:28:36.741 --> 00:28:38.367
- No.
- No.


204
00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:40.953
Something regarding his childhood?

205
00:28:40.995 --> 00:28:43.121
With great discretion.

206
00:28:43.248 --> 00:28:45.249
With great discretion, fine.

207
00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:48.877
- Dreams, yes, though.
- It depends on the dreams.


208
00:28:49.003 --> 00:28:53.382
- However, no... it's best not to.
- Best not to...


209
00:28:53.466 --> 00:28:55.717
Perfect, thank you.

210
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.386
Perfect.

211
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.513
Change of program!

212
00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:05.519
We'll start with
all that's happened recently.


213
00:29:05.603 --> 00:29:08.605
I just can't go on.

214
00:29:08.648 --> 00:29:12.025
Have you ever felt like this before?

215
00:29:13.236 --> 00:29:15.153
I don't know.

216
00:29:15.238 --> 00:29:17.906
I don't think so, but I don't know.

217
00:29:25.623 --> 00:29:27.791
Listen...

218
00:29:29.127 --> 00:29:32.296
- Any problems with your faith?
- No.


219
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.798
- You're sure?
- Yes.


220
00:29:34.883 --> 00:29:37.426
God sees abilities in me
I don't have.


221
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.179
Where are these abilities?

222
00:29:41.264 --> 00:29:43.891
I look for them and find nothing.

223
00:29:43.933 --> 00:29:47.811
You've been chosen,
let's say, by God...


224
00:29:47.896 --> 00:29:50.522
for your qualities...

225
00:29:50.565 --> 00:29:52.149
for your goodness.

226
00:29:52.191 --> 00:29:55.152
So how can you possibly suddenly...

227
00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:58.071
Was the doctor asked
if he's a believer?


228
00:29:58.156 --> 00:29:59.907
No one asked.

229
00:29:59.949 --> 00:30:01.950
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.


230
00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:05.203
- Not good.
- But I'm afraid that's how it is.


231
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.664
Anyway, let's go on.

232
00:30:07.707 --> 00:30:13.462
Excuse me, you can stay
it's fine, but in silence please!


233
00:30:13.588 --> 00:30:15.797
Your spokesman...

234
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.178
Your spokesman told me
that while they all waited for you...


235
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.973
- to go onto the balcony...
- Know what happened to me?


236
00:30:25.099 --> 00:30:30.354
- As they were coming towards me, some singing...
- Yes.


237
00:30:30.438 --> 00:30:33.231
Some crying...

238
00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:36.193
We were all very emotional.

239
00:30:36.235 --> 00:30:41.239
Little by little,
they began disappearing.


240
00:30:41.324 --> 00:30:43.617
They began disappearing?

241
00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:45.744
No...

242
00:30:45.828 --> 00:30:49.998
all the people I once knew
were suddenly gone.


243
00:30:50.083 --> 00:30:52.125
Everything vanished.

244
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.378
I can't remember anything.

245
00:31:03.388 --> 00:31:07.140
- Do you want to be Pope?
- I'm already Pope.


246
00:31:08.476 --> 00:31:10.769
It was decided by the cardinals.

247
00:31:11.729 --> 00:31:13.855
It was decided by God.

248
00:31:15.775 --> 00:31:18.735
Was this meeting of ours useful?

249
00:31:18.778 --> 00:31:19.903
I don't know.

250
00:31:19.988 --> 00:31:23.657
You see, Pope,
with all these people around...


251
00:31:23.783 --> 00:31:26.410
looking at me...

252
00:31:26.494 --> 00:31:28.787
checking me, I just can't work.

253
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:33.291
Maybe a colleague
who doesn't know he's the Pope...


254
00:31:33.376 --> 00:31:38.130
could meet him away from here.

255
00:31:38.172 --> 00:31:41.925
We must do something right away.

256
00:31:42.051 --> 00:31:44.052
That's why we came to you.

257
00:31:44.178 --> 00:31:47.431
- Because you're the best.
- A curse!


258
00:31:47.557 --> 00:31:49.933
Everyone always says:

259
00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:51.309
"You're the best".

260
00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:55.647
My wife, also a psychoanalyst,
always said:


261
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.191
"Darling, you're the best".

262
00:31:58.276 --> 00:32:02.571
But she left me,
she couldn't stand the comparison.


263
00:32:02.697 --> 00:32:05.282
- Is your wife good?
- The best after me.


264
00:32:05.324 --> 00:32:09.786
She's prepared, sensitive...

265
00:32:09.829 --> 00:32:14.791
but she's obsessed
with parental deficit. - Interesting.


266
00:32:14.834 --> 00:32:17.586
She tells everyone,
really everyone...


267
00:32:17.712 --> 00:32:22.215
when we all were small children,
infants...


268
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.801
when we were just a few...

269
00:32:24.844 --> 00:32:29.931
when we were just a few months old,
something happened...


270
00:32:29.974 --> 00:32:34.352
that we have to deal with
for the rest of our lives.


271
00:32:34.437 --> 00:32:38.982
So the fear of being abandoned...

272
00:32:39.067 --> 00:32:43.737
and the fear that something
might happen to us...


273
00:32:43.863 --> 00:32:46.323
- Where are we?
- It's your room.


274
00:32:46.365 --> 00:32:51.203
- My room?
- I'm here if you need anything.


275
00:32:51.245 --> 00:32:53.705
You'll be quite comfortable.

276
00:32:53.748 --> 00:32:57.125
Now I see!

277
00:32:57.251 --> 00:33:01.505
Don't worry, we're sworn to secrecy.

278
00:33:01.589 --> 00:33:03.882
You don't think I'd go around...

279
00:33:03.966 --> 00:33:08.512
If you'd like to phone home.

280
00:33:08.596 --> 00:33:12.265
I'll stay here, listen,
and then I'll take your phone.


281
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.519
No, my kids are in school now.
I have to call them this evening.


282
00:33:15.603 --> 00:33:17.229
Talk to them!

283
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:23.235
- Why take my phone?
- It's forbidden to communicate with the outside.


284
00:33:23.277 --> 00:33:25.237
I'm sorry.

285
00:33:27.031 --> 00:33:31.993
Meet with the cardinals,
those you're closest to...


286
00:33:32.036 --> 00:33:35.997
and start thinking of
a new Secretary of State...


287
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.292
or perhaps reconfirm
the previous one.


288
00:33:39.377 --> 00:33:42.504
Or, if you're up to it...

289
00:33:42.547 --> 00:33:46.633
you could go out on the balcony...

290
00:33:46.676 --> 00:33:50.554
to say hello to the faithful,
or just give a blessing.


291
00:33:52.014 --> 00:33:56.059
I didn't follow a word you said.

292
00:33:58.146 --> 00:33:59.896
Help me.

293
00:34:01.566 --> 00:34:03.942
I can't do this!

294
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.448
Rajski, what's
the reaction of the faithful?


295
00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:14.661
How are they taking this uncertainty,
what do they know.


296
00:34:14.704 --> 00:34:20.417
No one knows anything, but we
can't keep it secret much longer.


297
00:34:20.459 --> 00:34:25.589
All together we can convince
His Holiness to go out on the balcony.


298
00:34:25.715 --> 00:34:29.676
Locked up in here,
maybe you don't realize.


299
00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:32.304
This is a very big deal!

300
00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:38.935
Don't do that.

301
00:34:38.978 --> 00:34:42.105
That attitude doesn't help.

302
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.692
You see, we don't know what to do.

303
00:34:45.735 --> 00:34:49.988
No one ever thought
anything like this could happen.


304
00:35:04.879 --> 00:35:07.130
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


305
00:35:12.887 --> 00:35:14.888
Good evening.

306
00:35:36.035 --> 00:35:38.036
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


307
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.874
Come in.

308
00:35:42.917 --> 00:35:44.292
Good evening.

309
00:35:44.377 --> 00:35:46.419
Good evening, how are you?

310
00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:48.296
Fine.

311
00:35:48.381 --> 00:35:50.674
- Good night.
- Good night.


312
00:36:01.394 --> 00:36:03.812
We can't do this!

313
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.692
Mom, help!

314
00:36:09.944 --> 00:36:12.821
Mommy, help!

315
00:36:13.572 --> 00:36:15.782
No!

316
00:36:40.933 --> 00:36:44.853
No! Why?

317
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.492
We can't do this!

318
00:37:00.494 --> 00:37:02.120
No!

319
00:37:05.875 --> 00:37:07.876
- Good night.
- Good night.


320
00:38:23.702 --> 00:38:28.331
Two are positioned
on the Bingo Hall on this square...


321
00:38:28.416 --> 00:38:32.085
another three
on the roof of the Eden Theater.


322
00:38:32.211 --> 00:38:35.296
If we go through Piazza Adriana...

323
00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:40.552
one of you substitutes
the newsagent...


324
00:38:40.594 --> 00:38:43.096
two dress as traffic cops...

325
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.225
and we'll put another eight
on the Castel Sant'Angelo walkway.


326
00:38:48.102 --> 00:38:52.730
For security reasons, the route
will be decided at the last minute.


327
00:38:52.815 --> 00:38:55.066
I remind you that the cardinals...

328
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:59.612
We'd rather the cardinals know
nothing about this operation.


329
00:38:59.697 --> 00:39:02.615
However, we'll be back
within a couple of hours...


330
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.077
and all this
will never have happened.


331
00:39:07.496 --> 00:39:09.497
Hello, how's it going?

332
00:39:10.374 --> 00:39:13.334
Rajski, I wrote it all here.

333
00:39:13.377 --> 00:39:17.964
The first eleven patients
must be contacted immediately...


334
00:39:18.007 --> 00:39:21.092
we had appointments
for today or tomorrow.


335
00:39:21.135 --> 00:39:24.262
- Please, tell them gently.
- Don't worry.


336
00:39:24.388 --> 00:39:27.390
I haven't missed a day in six years.

337
00:39:27.516 --> 00:39:32.020
Tell them I'm sick
and it will take...


338
00:39:35.524 --> 00:39:37.650
How long will I be sick?

339
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.938
That never opened again...

340
00:40:15.064 --> 00:40:17.440
leaving the world holding its breath.

341
00:40:17.566 --> 00:40:24.155
The faithful sang and prayed
in the square all night...


342
00:40:24.198 --> 00:40:27.033
I saw someone moving
behind the drapes.


343
00:40:27.076 --> 00:40:28.826
I'm sure it was two cardinals.

344
00:40:28.953 --> 00:40:31.579
I feel something will soon happen.

345
00:40:31.664 --> 00:40:33.456
You just heard a nun talking.

346
00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:38.711
These rumors still haven't
been denied by the Holy See.


347
00:40:39.713 --> 00:40:45.051
Meantime we're receiving statements
from Heads of State worldwide.


348
00:40:45.094 --> 00:40:48.179
"We feel great anxiety",
said Sarkozy.


349
00:40:48.222 --> 00:40:52.100
"But the entire Catholic world trusts
the Vatican to find a rapid solution".


350
00:40:52.184 --> 00:40:56.479
- It's shameful.
- The President of Brazil is flying to Italy...


351
00:40:56.564 --> 00:41:00.358
to be close to the Holy See.

352
00:41:24.008 --> 00:41:26.342
Second floor, apartment 3.

353
00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:32.890
So, you've always lived alone?

354
00:41:33.892 --> 00:41:38.021
- Why do you ask?
- It will help me get to know you.


355
00:41:38.105 --> 00:41:41.899
You say you're not married,
you have no children.


356
00:41:41.984 --> 00:41:45.403
- Any important ties of affection?
- No.


357
00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:48.781
Has this been a problem for you?

358
00:41:50.034 --> 00:41:53.620
I don't know,
that's how my life has been.


359
00:41:55.914 --> 00:42:00.251
I can't do anything anymore,
I'm always tired.


360
00:42:00.294 --> 00:42:02.795
Have you talked to anyone
about this difficulty?


361
00:42:02.921 --> 00:42:04.881
No one.

362
00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:07.925
But everyone knows by now.

363
00:42:08.052 --> 00:42:09.761
I can't do this.

364
00:42:11.889 --> 00:42:14.515
But the others
have great trust in me.


365
00:42:14.558 --> 00:42:18.686
- The others?
- I'd like to do so much.


366
00:42:20.314 --> 00:42:22.565
So many things need to be changed.

367
00:42:22.691 --> 00:42:25.193
I'd like...

368
00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.657
- So, you work.
- Yes, but... no.


369
00:42:30.699 --> 00:42:32.158
What do you do?

370
00:42:33.202 --> 00:42:35.203
- What do I do?
- Yes.


371
00:42:41.418 --> 00:42:44.212
- I'm an actor.
- An actor!


372
00:42:44.338 --> 00:42:46.339
Nice!

373
00:42:46.465 --> 00:42:48.591
- But an actor...
- Theater.


374
00:42:49.176 --> 00:42:52.428
I've always loved it.

375
00:42:53.681 --> 00:42:55.598
The tours...

376
00:42:55.724 --> 00:42:58.851
traveling from one city to another...

377
00:42:58.977 --> 00:43:00.561
the rehearsals...

378
00:43:00.604 --> 00:43:05.358
the opening nights,
when you read the reviews together.


379
00:43:06.068 --> 00:43:07.735
Nice.

380
00:43:08.696 --> 00:43:11.364
But now I'm tired.

381
00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:17.620
How did it go?

382
00:43:20.249 --> 00:43:24.377
I think it will take
three sessions a week.


383
00:43:24.461 --> 00:43:29.465
- For how many weeks?
- I'd say a couple of years.


384
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.760
That's a lot.

385
00:43:33.762 --> 00:43:35.596
I know.

386
00:43:38.016 --> 00:43:40.351
I need to walk a little.

387
00:44:23.187 --> 00:44:25.521
No! No!

388
00:44:46.335 --> 00:44:48.836
A sustained heaviness.

389
00:44:48.921 --> 00:44:51.964
My head's too full,
but I don't know what of.


390
00:44:53.467 --> 00:44:58.596
It's like a kind of
psychological sinusitis.


391
00:44:59.848 --> 00:45:03.100
Is this what you call depression?

392
00:45:03.185 --> 00:45:06.103
It happened to me so suddenly.

393
00:45:06.188 --> 00:45:08.105
Faster!

394
00:45:10.984 --> 00:45:13.069
What have we done...

395
00:45:15.739 --> 00:45:17.865
What have you done!

396
00:45:24.456 --> 00:45:28.251
Perhaps you suffered
because your mother...


397
00:45:28.335 --> 00:45:31.754
when you were a small child...

398
00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:34.715
paid more attention to someone else.

399
00:45:34.758 --> 00:45:37.260
You know what we call that?

400
00:45:37.344 --> 00:45:39.011
Parental deficit.

401
00:45:39.137 --> 00:45:41.347
- What?
- What should I remember.


402
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.140
Yes.

403
00:46:28.061 --> 00:46:30.771
What should I remember?

404
00:46:30.814 --> 00:46:34.191
My first three months,
my first three years...


405
00:46:35.402 --> 00:46:37.403
I don't remember a thing.

406
00:46:37.446 --> 00:46:37.946
Sir!

407
00:46:44.578 --> 00:46:46.787
Are you sick?

408
00:46:49.416 --> 00:46:51.292
Do you need help?

409
00:46:54.838 --> 00:46:57.840
- A little water?
- Yes.


410
00:47:04.181 --> 00:47:06.849
How are you feeling? Any better.

411
00:47:06.934 --> 00:47:09.477
Better, thank you.

412
00:47:09.603 --> 00:47:12.355
If you wait, I'm through in an hour.

413
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:16.108
- I'll take you to a bus stop.
- There's no need, really,


414
00:47:16.193 --> 00:47:18.736
I'm fine now.

415
00:47:18.862 --> 00:47:23.449
- You're still very pale.
- I said I'm fine now!


416
00:47:23.492 --> 00:47:26.243
Didn't you hear me?

417
00:47:26.328 --> 00:47:29.455
- If you want...
- Stop, I'm fine, I told you!


418
00:48:32.811 --> 00:48:34.812
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


419
00:48:34.896 --> 00:48:37.940
- Excuse me, do you have...
- The bathroom's out of order.


420
00:48:40.652 --> 00:48:42.069
Pardon me.

421
00:48:44.573 --> 00:48:48.576
- May I make a phone call?
- The phone's only for work.


422
00:48:53.665 --> 00:48:55.416
Sir?

423
00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.712
- You can use mine.
- Very kind of you.


424
00:49:00.714 --> 00:49:05.468
- Thank you.
- It's a short call.


425
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.861
- Hello?
- I'm Melville.


426
00:49:23.987 --> 00:49:26.697
Holiness! How are you?

427
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.617
Tell me where you are,
we'll come immediately.


428
00:49:29.743 --> 00:49:31.994
- No.
- Where are you?


429
00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:34.580
I don't know.

430
00:49:35.248 --> 00:49:38.751
- Are you all right?
- I feel better.


431
00:49:38.835 --> 00:49:42.630
- We're worried about you, you should come back!
- Be patient.


432
00:49:42.714 --> 00:49:44.882
I need time.

433
00:49:45.008 --> 00:49:48.761
I have to remember
a lot of things about my life...


434
00:49:48.845 --> 00:49:51.472
- things I've forgotten.
- Please...


435
00:49:51.515 --> 00:49:56.268
Do it for me, I made such a fuck...
an unforgivable mistake!


436
00:49:56.394 --> 00:49:59.396
Help me please, come back.

437
00:49:59.523 --> 00:50:01.982
Not now.

438
00:50:02.025 --> 00:50:04.151
I'll call you soon.

439
00:50:05.904 --> 00:50:09.156
- I'm not sure I can do it...
- Don't worry.


440
00:50:09.282 --> 00:50:13.160
It's very simple but rather important.

441
00:50:13.286 --> 00:50:16.664
Stop here please.

442
00:50:20.043 --> 00:50:21.919
Here.

443
00:50:22.045 --> 00:50:25.673
Move these drapes
in the morning, very early...


444
00:50:27.551 --> 00:50:32.680
so they'll all see
the Holy Father is in his apartments.


445
00:50:32.806 --> 00:50:36.308
Do it a couple of times a day...

446
00:50:36.393 --> 00:50:39.019
and once before going to bed.

447
00:50:39.062 --> 00:50:42.439
But be careful,
all they must see is a shadow.


448
00:50:42.524 --> 00:50:44.692
Remove your beret, of course.

449
00:50:44.818 --> 00:50:47.945
- Can I turn on the TV?
- Yes, occasionally.


450
00:50:48.071 --> 00:50:53.826
Remove your doublet too.
I'll have them bring you something white.


451
00:50:54.828 --> 00:50:56.662
Good night.

452
00:51:08.466 --> 00:51:12.803
"For my days vanish like smoke..."

453
00:51:12.846 --> 00:51:16.724
".. my bones burn like glowing embers."

454
00:51:16.808 --> 00:51:19.852
"Hear how these Bible passages..."

455
00:51:19.978 --> 00:51:24.565
"..seem to echo
the situation of the Holy Father."


456
00:51:24.608 --> 00:51:29.445
"My heart is blighted
and withered like grass."


457
00:51:29.487 --> 00:51:33.824
"I forget to eat my food."

458
00:51:40.373 --> 00:51:43.083
"Fear and trembling come upon me..."

459
00:51:43.126 --> 00:51:46.337
"..and anguish overwhelms me".

460
00:51:46.838 --> 00:51:52.134
In the Bible, the only book
you put in my room...


461
00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.470
I might add...

462
00:51:54.512 --> 00:51:58.015
in the Bible,
it talks about depression.


463
00:51:58.099 --> 00:52:01.602
Yes, but this cannot
concern the Holy Father.


464
00:52:01.645 --> 00:52:06.273
It is you, due to your temperament
and professional bias...


465
00:52:06.399 --> 00:52:08.108
who sees depression everywhere.

466
00:52:08.151 --> 00:52:13.405
But in this book
are all the symptoms of depression:


467
00:52:13.531 --> 00:52:17.910
Feelings of guilt, weight loss,
suicidal thoughts.


468
00:52:18.036 --> 00:52:19.912
"I feel better".

469
00:52:21.289 --> 00:52:26.919
The Holy Father just told me
these exact words:


470
00:52:27.045 --> 00:52:29.046
"I feel better".

471
00:52:29.172 --> 00:52:32.758
He had a good day, he prayed...

472
00:52:32.801 --> 00:52:36.637
he had something to eat
in his apartments...


473
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.807
and his mood seemed encouraging.

474
00:52:44.187 --> 00:52:47.314
You're pleased
the Holy Father feels better?


475
00:52:49.818 --> 00:52:52.695
- Australian cardinals, good evening.
- Good evening.


476
00:52:52.779 --> 00:52:56.198
- How's the jet lag?
- Much better, thank you.


477
00:52:56.283 --> 00:52:59.076
- What is it?
- "Living with the Etruscans".


478
00:52:59.202 --> 00:53:02.913
- Is it worth a visit?
- It's a beautiful outing.


479
00:53:02.956 --> 00:53:05.833
I've never been there
but it's beautiful.


480
00:53:05.959 --> 00:53:08.335
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


481
00:53:09.337 --> 00:53:12.214
Everything we need is
here in the Vatican, right?


482
00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:17.845
The famous service station
where gas costs less...


483
00:53:17.929 --> 00:53:19.847
shops...

484
00:53:19.973 --> 00:53:21.849
Gym facilities.

485
00:53:21.933 --> 00:53:25.978
- Gym facilities?
- Sure. - Just great.


486
00:53:26.104 --> 00:53:32.484
The pharmacy with medicines
you can't find in Rome.


487
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.486
Well, well...

488
00:54:03.266 --> 00:54:08.395
We who are fortunate
to think we understand things...


489
00:54:10.774 --> 00:54:16.153
but recently it's been hard for
the Church to understand things.


490
00:54:21.159 --> 00:54:24.286
The beginning of Peter's mission...

491
00:54:24.412 --> 00:54:26.789
in the history of salvation...

492
00:54:28.124 --> 00:54:31.418
in the history of God's people...

493
00:54:31.544 --> 00:54:34.505
Why?

494
00:54:34.547 --> 00:54:37.174
What's changed?

495
00:54:39.177 --> 00:54:41.762
I can't live without you.

496
00:54:45.683 --> 00:54:48.644
We've often been afraid...

497
00:54:50.563 --> 00:54:53.065
to admit our faults.

498
00:54:55.318 --> 00:54:58.153
Yes, I'm talking to myself.

499
00:55:00.657 --> 00:55:04.076
I'm looking for the words
for a speech I have to make...


500
00:55:04.202 --> 00:55:08.163
before a crowd of people.

501
00:55:08.206 --> 00:55:10.541
I'm a little worried.

502
00:55:16.339 --> 00:55:21.677
If I take my usual sleeping pill
before bedtime...


503
00:55:21.719 --> 00:55:25.055
when I wake up at 3,
I take this other one?


504
00:55:25.098 --> 00:55:31.437
- No! - Why?
- These medicines don't go together.


505
00:55:31.813 --> 00:55:33.605
Sleeping pills.

506
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:37.234
This is the family of tranquilizers.

507
00:55:37.318 --> 00:55:40.696
These are mood stabilizers...

508
00:55:42.615 --> 00:55:46.618
This is a major tranquilizer.
This is strong!


509
00:55:46.703 --> 00:55:48.370
Who takes this?

510
00:55:50.373 --> 00:55:53.208
- Who takes this?
- I don't know.


511
00:56:00.758 --> 00:56:04.761
Anyway, if you take a sleeping pill...

512
00:56:04.846 --> 00:56:08.265
it should have a short half-life.

513
00:56:08.391 --> 00:56:13.228
O'Neill, let's say you wake up
tomorrow wanting to do sports.


514
00:56:13.271 --> 00:56:16.023
- I don't do sports!
- Follow me on this.


515
00:56:16.149 --> 00:56:21.612
If you do sports tomorrow,
you'll still be fuzzy from this...


516
00:56:21.654 --> 00:56:24.907
- Good evening to all.
- How is he?


517
00:56:24.991 --> 00:56:28.660
Better, his appetite's back.
His Holiness ate everything.


518
00:56:28.745 --> 00:56:33.790
Two types of prosciutto,
all the vegetables.


519
00:56:33.875 --> 00:56:36.251
He devoured the fruit...

520
00:56:36.294 --> 00:56:39.171
and even had a small dessert.

521
00:56:39.297 --> 00:56:44.009
Now he's resting in his apartments.

522
00:57:18.169 --> 00:57:20.087
Like it?

523
00:57:20.213 --> 00:57:22.798
I have a parental deficit.

524
00:57:26.094 --> 00:57:27.970
But I don't know what it is.

525
00:57:41.568 --> 00:57:43.485
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


526
00:57:44.362 --> 00:57:48.699
Excuse me, could I have a room?

527
00:57:48.741 --> 00:57:51.743
- How many nights?
- I don't know.


528
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.082
- For tonight?
- Yes. Special rates?


529
00:57:57.125 --> 00:57:58.875
No.

530
00:58:05.383 --> 00:58:07.759
- Poor man.
- Why?


531
00:58:07.844 --> 00:58:09.886
They say he's dead.

532
00:58:09.971 --> 00:58:12.889
Now they'll elect another,
but without letting on.


533
00:58:14.392 --> 00:58:17.978
- They said it on TV?
- They can't...


534
00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:19.521
but it's obvious.

535
00:58:24.402 --> 00:58:28.280
The Holy Father
is in his rooms, in prayer.


536
00:58:28.364 --> 00:58:30.115
But the moment
we've been waiting for...


537
00:58:37.874 --> 00:58:41.668
Nuntio vobis gaudium magnum...

538
00:59:16.162 --> 00:59:18.205
The Pope!

539
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:21.291
Brummer!

540
00:59:26.339 --> 00:59:28.423
The Pope!

541
00:59:28.925 --> 00:59:31.551
What is happening?

542
00:59:31.594 --> 00:59:35.430
- The Pope!
- He feels better.


543
01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:22.644
Nina, coming from backstage:
"It's clear we can't continue".


544
01:00:22.729 --> 01:00:24.896
"I can leave, goodbye."

545
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:28.650
She kisses Arkadina
and Polina Andryevna...


546
01:00:30.486 --> 01:00:33.780
- Please, excuse us.
- "May I introduce Boris Alexeyevich."


547
01:00:33.906 --> 01:00:38.869
Nina, confounded:
"A great joy, I've read your books."


548
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:41.788
Arkadina, sitting Nina beside her:

549
01:00:41.914 --> 01:00:45.292
"Don't be confounded, dear,
he's a celebrity."


550
01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:49.421
"But he's a simple man,
and is himself confounded."


551
01:00:49.547 --> 01:00:51.673
Dorn, irritated:

552
01:00:51.758 --> 01:00:54.050
"Jakov, my brother, raise the curtain."

553
01:00:54.177 --> 01:00:59.139
"When I was young I wanted to be
a scholar, but didn't become one!"


554
01:00:59.182 --> 01:01:03.185
"I wanted to be an orator, but my
speaking would make you nauseous!"


555
01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:06.646
"I wanted to marry but didn't!"

556
01:01:06.689 --> 01:01:08.148
"I wanted to live in the city."

557
01:01:08.191 --> 01:01:11.067
"I wanted to live in the city..."

558
01:01:11.194 --> 01:01:15.071
".. but I end my life living
in the country. And that's it."


559
01:01:16.657 --> 01:01:21.703
"To express dissatisfaction
with life at sixty-two, is petty."


560
01:01:21.788 --> 01:01:23.663
"How obstinate!"

561
01:01:23.706 --> 01:01:27.459
- "Can't you see I want to live?"
- "That's frivolity."


562
01:01:27.585 --> 01:01:31.463
"The laws of Nature dictate
that every life must end."


563
01:01:31.547 --> 01:01:35.342
"You reason as a satiated man.
You are satiated..."


564
01:01:35.468 --> 01:01:38.094
"..so you're uninterested in life."

565
01:01:38.221 --> 01:01:40.972
Medvedenko: "Let's go home, Masha!"

566
01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:44.100
- "Let's go home, Masha."
- Masha:"Go by yourself."


567
01:01:44.185 --> 01:01:48.230
- "Go by yourself".
- Medvedenco: Your father won't give me horses."


568
01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:51.483
- "Your father won't give me horses."
- Stop, why repeat my lines?


569
01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:53.819
- My sister...
- You have no sister!


570
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:57.739
- It's not true.
- My sister played Chekhov for many years.


571
01:01:57.865 --> 01:02:00.492
I know it by heart.

572
01:02:00.576 --> 01:02:02.619
- "The Seagull".
- Masha.


573
01:02:02.745 --> 01:02:04.955
Masha, confidently:

574
01:02:06.624 --> 01:02:09.000
"He will, ask him for them."

575
01:02:09.085 --> 01:02:11.253
"He will."

576
01:02:11.337 --> 01:02:14.631
"Father, will you let
my husband have a horse?"


577
01:02:14.757 --> 01:02:17.384
Shamrayev: "Not possible!"

578
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:19.261
Not possible!

579
01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:22.973
Medvedenco: "I'll walk home."

580
01:02:23.975 --> 01:02:26.518
And at last, he exits.

581
01:02:27.395 --> 01:02:29.521
We'll see you soon.

582
01:05:10.016 --> 01:05:14.686
You had three points,
plus one, is four.


583
01:05:14.812 --> 01:05:17.814
- We made just one point?
- Yes!


584
01:05:17.898 --> 01:05:21.067
You had to take
5 and 4 with 9!

585
01:05:21.193 --> 01:05:24.571
- With a 7 on the table?
- You don't know how to play.


586
01:05:24.655 --> 01:05:27.907
You should have left the 7
and called "spariglio".


587
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:31.286
- But we made a point.
- And they got two points...


588
01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:34.789
with the last trick.

589
01:05:34.832 --> 01:05:37.167
When it's not your hand,
you must call "spariglio".


590
01:05:37.209 --> 01:05:42.088
- You're always distracted!
- No, I'm focused.


591
01:05:42.214 --> 01:05:45.967
- No, it's no way to play!
- I'm very sorry.


592
01:05:46.052 --> 01:05:48.094
It's the second time we've lost.

593
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.723
- Whose deal is it?
- Excuse me, I can't take anymore.


594
01:05:51.807 --> 01:05:56.352
- You're offended?
- No, I have a headache.


595
01:05:56.479 --> 01:06:01.733
- Would you like to play?
- I don't know what they think.


596
01:06:01.817 --> 01:06:07.238
- Know what "spariglio" is?
- I've been told lots of times.


597
01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:12.118
I think I understand,
but I can't follow this technique.


598
01:06:12.244 --> 01:06:15.371
Let me play my own way.

599
01:06:17.124 --> 01:06:19.876
"Evgenij, which of us
looks younger?"


600
01:06:20.002 --> 01:06:22.879
- "You, of course."
- "You see! And why?"


601
01:06:22.963 --> 01:06:26.633
- "Because I work, I feel..."
- Because I work, I feel.


602
01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:31.346
You're always in the same place,
you don't live.


603
01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:35.266
"I have a rule:
Never look to the future."


604
01:06:35.392 --> 01:06:37.519
"I never think about old age or death."

605
01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:41.397
"I feel like I
was born so long ago..."

606
01:06:41.482 --> 01:06:45.527
- "I drag my life like an endless train".
- Excuse me.


607
01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.279
"Often I've no desire to live."

608
01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:51.658
Here Dorn should come in.

609
01:06:51.784 --> 01:06:56.746
- Did you visit Dario? How is he?
- The doctors say it's not serious.


610
01:06:56.789 --> 01:07:01.292
- But he won't make the opening night.
- Pardon...


611
01:07:01.377 --> 01:07:03.795
That's it? Did you call Baldineti?

612
01:07:03.879 --> 01:07:08.800
Yes, but he's on tour,
Guerrini's not here or Zagoni...


613
01:07:08.884 --> 01:07:12.637
and not even that tall guy
with a moustache, De Biasio.


614
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:17.433
- What'll we do about Dorn?
- I can give the lines.


615
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:23.064
I've given it some thought, I guess
I'll just have to do it myself.


616
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:28.444
- Oh, great.
- Just for the first few days!


617
01:07:29.947 --> 01:07:33.032
I really miss my wife.

618
01:07:33.075 --> 01:07:38.079
A period of being apart gives you
the chance to measure the value of love.


619
01:07:38.205 --> 01:07:42.667
- What do you know?
- No, guys, I miss her...


620
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:46.296
meaning, we're separated.

621
01:07:46.338 --> 01:07:49.591
She's a psychoanalyst too.

622
01:07:49.675 --> 01:07:55.346
She left me because I'm the best
and it bothered her.


623
01:07:55.431 --> 01:08:01.227
She's good too, but she's
obsessed with parental deficit.


624
01:08:01.312 --> 01:08:03.605
Interesting!

625
01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:06.482
But these are formulas.

626
01:08:06.567 --> 01:08:08.568
I could simplify and say...

627
01:08:08.611 --> 01:08:13.239
the Holy Father
feels vulnerable at the moment...


628
01:08:13.324 --> 01:08:17.118
but at the same time,
narcissistically exceptional!


629
01:08:17.203 --> 01:08:20.747
- How dare you?
- I mean the man...


630
01:08:20.873 --> 01:08:22.874
- not the Pope.
- They're the same thing!


631
01:08:22.958 --> 01:08:25.251
I'm not so sure... Queen.

632
01:08:25.336 --> 01:08:27.462
Does your wife have a new life?

633
01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:30.840
Yes, she's been with a guy
for a few years.


634
01:08:30.883 --> 01:08:36.095
He's a good person, but she can't
bring herself to tell our kids.


635
01:08:36.138 --> 01:08:38.640
He's a psychoanalyst too.

636
01:08:38.724 --> 01:08:41.392
All these psychoanalysts!
Is there such a need?


637
01:08:41.477 --> 01:08:45.146
But I have a good relationship
with my wife.


638
01:08:45.272 --> 01:08:48.524
- I'm glad. - Yes.
- I'm glad too.


639
01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:50.610
Point!

640
01:08:50.653 --> 01:08:54.280
I confused them with my chatter.

641
01:08:54.406 --> 01:08:59.410
Actually, the Conclave
is still technically operative.


642
01:08:59.495 --> 01:09:03.122
Yes, we all heard
the spokesman for the Holy See...


643
01:09:03.165 --> 01:09:08.795
but I don't think he reassured
the hundreds of millions of faithful.


644
01:09:08.921 --> 01:09:12.799
Might we say this is
an unexpected event?


645
01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:16.761
You know I used to eat here
with Salvo Randone?


646
01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:18.429
Do you know who he was?

647
01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:23.893
He's the one who, with Gassman,
would do Othello one evening...


648
01:09:23.936 --> 01:09:26.062
and lago the next, they'd swap parts.

649
01:09:26.146 --> 01:09:29.440
We need to be patient.

650
01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:34.028
Haven't you formed an opinion
about what might have happened?


651
01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:39.200
I don't think there's
a mystery behind all this.


652
01:09:39.326 --> 01:09:43.955
A search for serenity, in silence,
before approaching the waiting world...


653
01:09:44.081 --> 01:09:47.834
- is a Pontiff's prerogative.
- It's not nonsense:


654
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.337
Wine and tobacco
deprive the personality.


655
01:09:51.422 --> 01:09:54.048
Loving without hope.

656
01:09:54.091 --> 01:09:56.217
Entire years waiting for something...

657
01:09:56.302 --> 01:10:01.597
Last night I went into the garden
to see if our old theater was still there.


658
01:10:01.724 --> 01:10:05.059
- And it was there.
- It's dark in the garden.


659
01:10:05.102 --> 01:10:08.855
They should tear down that theater.

660
01:10:08.939 --> 01:10:12.859
It is there, bare.

661
01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:15.611
After a good cigar or some vodka...

662
01:10:26.123 --> 01:10:30.626
Let's remember that the Pope
is the Lord's first servant.


663
01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:36.841
- But he's also the last.
- The first, but also the last.


664
01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:39.010
So, the first and also the last.

665
01:10:39.094 --> 01:10:41.512
This leads us, as a consequence?

666
01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:46.225
As a consequence this leads us...

667
01:10:50.856 --> 01:10:53.775
- This leads us...
- This leads us?


668
01:10:54.777 --> 01:10:57.278
No, I'm improvising!

669
01:10:57.363 --> 01:11:00.281
The truth is I'm totally confused.

670
01:11:00.407 --> 01:11:04.243
I ask the viewers' forgiveness.

671
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.288
Forgiveness from all of you.

672
01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.793
- Sorry.
- No, no problem!


673
01:11:11.877 --> 01:11:14.670
I remind you, formally,
the Conclave still isn't over...


674
01:11:14.755 --> 01:11:18.132
- I know.
- The cardinals are still isolated...


675
01:11:18.175 --> 01:11:21.386
far from the glare of the media.

676
01:11:21.428 --> 01:11:25.932
Europe, I haven't decided
if you're in two or three teams.


677
01:11:26.058 --> 01:11:29.769
North America, Asia, 
South America...

678
01:11:29.812 --> 01:11:32.688
Oceania, Swiss Guards...

679
01:11:32.773 --> 01:11:38.653
No! The tournament's unbalanced
with the Swiss Guards!


680
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.283
- You like winning, right?
- Yes.


681
01:11:44.326 --> 01:11:48.579
You're right,
no team of Swiss Guards...


682
01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:52.333
but I can't remember your name,
Cardinal.- Pescardona.


683
01:11:52.459 --> 01:11:55.837
During the Conclave...

684
01:11:55.921 --> 01:11:59.924
the bookmakers,
especially the English...


685
01:11:59.967 --> 01:12:02.343
have odds for all of you.

686
01:12:02.428 --> 01:12:04.470
Let's see Pescardona...

687
01:12:04.596 --> 01:12:07.473
Pescardona, Pescar...

688
01:12:11.228 --> 01:12:15.314
- You were given 7 to 1!
- What's that? Good?


689
01:12:15.357 --> 01:12:17.608
It sure is!

690
01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:20.862
The Holy Father was given
just 90 to 1.


691
01:12:20.946 --> 01:12:23.573
- That's wonderful!
- You don't understand.


692
01:12:23.615 --> 01:12:25.616
I'll explain.

693
01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:31.122
If you'd bet 10 Euros on him,
you'd have won 900.


694
01:12:31.206 --> 01:12:36.252
- Not bad?
- Then there's Cruz 72.


695
01:12:36.336 --> 01:12:39.630
Gregori well, the favored.

696
01:12:39.715 --> 01:12:43.384
- Here he is! - Good evening.
- We were talking about you.


697
01:12:43.469 --> 01:12:45.511
You were given 3 to 1.

698
01:12:45.637 --> 01:12:49.098
Was he disappointed
not to be elected?


699
01:12:49.141 --> 01:12:51.100
No one here is disappointed.

700
01:12:51.143 --> 01:12:54.979
- Lucky you!
- Brummer, what were my odds?


701
01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.898
Brummer you say?

702
01:12:57.024 --> 01:12:58.774
Brummer...

703
01:12:58.901 --> 01:12:59.984
Brummer.

704
01:13:01.904 --> 01:13:07.033
If you all agree,
I'll choose the teams' captains...


705
01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:09.243
from the bookmakers' favorites.

706
01:13:09.286 --> 01:13:12.497
The captains can be Aguilar...

707
01:13:12.539 --> 01:13:16.417
Aguilar, Cincotta, Stenton, Bikila...

708
01:13:16.502 --> 01:13:19.045
You didn't give my number!

709
01:13:19.129 --> 01:13:24.300
If I didn't, there's a reason!
What do you think?


710
01:13:26.929 --> 01:13:28.888
Your number's not here.

711
01:13:28.931 --> 01:13:31.432
Your number doesn't exist.

712
01:13:31.558 --> 01:13:34.810
Since you insist:
You were given no odds at all!


713
01:13:34.895 --> 01:13:39.023
You weren't considered!

714
01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:40.816
You insisted, happy now?

715
01:13:40.943 --> 01:13:43.569
- No.
- I'd say not!


716
01:13:43.695 --> 01:13:45.321
But you insisted!

717
01:13:46.949 --> 01:13:51.827
Flatten these corners, all the way.

718
01:13:51.954 --> 01:13:54.705
To the side...

719
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:59.210
it has to be flattened right
to the end or we'll get hurt.


720
01:13:59.336 --> 01:14:01.587
Go, like that... come back!

721
01:14:01.672 --> 01:14:03.798
There's a hollow here.

722
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.592
Go back...

723
01:14:06.677 --> 01:14:11.097
Now this part here.

724
01:14:13.809 --> 01:14:18.479
You have to flatten it,
one, two, three times...


725
01:14:18.564 --> 01:14:25.361
if not, when we jump
we could get hurt.


726
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:37.456
Like that, overhand.

727
01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:41.502
Overhand.

728
01:14:43.088 --> 01:14:45.214
Next in line.

729
01:14:47.759 --> 01:14:49.135
Next.

730
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.764
- The Korean way. - What's it like?
- Underhand with a spin.


731
01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:01.647
Okay, no spin there...

732
01:15:01.732 --> 01:15:07.278
In the first heat is: North America,
Asia, Europe A, Eastern Europe.


733
01:15:07.362 --> 01:15:11.782
Why can't we have
an all-Italian team?


734
01:15:11.908 --> 01:15:16.245
No, you Italians play
either on the Europe A team...


735
01:15:16.288 --> 01:15:18.539
or on the Europe B.

736
01:15:18.624 --> 01:15:24.420
Please, don't spoil the grid,
I worked on it all night.


737
01:15:24.504 --> 01:15:29.050
Or I'll leave and you can do
the tournament by yourselves!


738
01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:34.055
Why don't we play Prison Dodgeball?

739
01:15:35.182 --> 01:15:37.558
- What?
- Prison Dodgeball.


740
01:15:37.643 --> 01:15:40.144
- Prison Dodgeball?
- Yes.


741
01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:45.816
Cardinal, it hasn't been played
in 50 years!


742
01:15:45.901 --> 01:15:50.696
In the second heat is:
South America, Africa...


743
01:15:50.822 --> 01:15:55.951
- Europa B e Oceania.
- But there are just three of us!


744
01:15:56.036 --> 01:16:00.289
Oceania is just three? Too bad!

745
01:16:00.332 --> 01:16:04.085
That means
you get experience this time...


746
01:16:04.169 --> 01:16:09.465
then, if you're good to
the faithful in the coming years.


747
01:16:09.591 --> 01:16:11.717
There will be more of you at
the next Conclave, 4, 5, 6...


748
01:16:11.843 --> 01:16:15.846
Do you see why it's better
to do a round-robin tournament...


749
01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:19.100
and not a direct elimination?

750
01:16:19.184 --> 01:16:23.604
- Professor, we don't understand.
- I can tell.


751
01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:26.857
But it's okay, just don't get mad.

752
01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:28.484
I won't get mad.

753
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:34.115
And with more games we give the Holy
Father more time to get back on his feet.


754
01:16:34.199 --> 01:16:37.743
Never underestimate the support...

755
01:16:37.828 --> 01:16:42.957
he receives in feeling
surrounded by this energy...


756
01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:45.376
this fighting spirit.

757
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:53.259
I'd even tend towards
a double round-robin tournament.


758
01:16:53.385 --> 01:16:55.886
Double round-robin, no!

759
01:16:56.012 --> 01:16:57.638
We'd die!

760
01:16:58.974 --> 01:17:01.100
Come on, Giulio!

761
01:17:01.643 --> 01:17:03.394
It's true!

762
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.397
Mommy knows him, it's okay.

763
01:17:07.482 --> 01:17:11.277
I thought about it, it's true,
I've never really felt well.


764
01:17:12.529 --> 01:17:16.907
But I've done many things in my life.

765
01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:20.035
- Yes.
- I've even done some good.


766
01:17:22.748 --> 01:17:26.500
Why can't I do anything anymore?

767
01:17:26.543 --> 01:17:30.921
Can we talk later?
I'm taking the kids to school.


768
01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:34.675
Talk to you later.

769
01:17:36.136 --> 01:17:38.179
Yes, me too.

770
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:41.432
Was that your boyfriend?

771
01:17:42.642 --> 01:17:46.187
No way!
It was Leonardo, my colleague.


772
01:17:46.271 --> 01:17:50.441
- Giulio told me you have a boyfriend.
- Not true, I didn't tell you anything.


773
01:17:50.567 --> 01:17:52.526
You're an idiot!

774
01:17:52.569 --> 01:17:55.571
- You say it every night, I can't stand it!
- Mouth!


775
01:17:55.655 --> 01:17:58.574
Your classmates say so too:
You're a big mouth!


776
01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.410
- You're stupid!
- Stop it!


777
01:18:01.453 --> 01:18:03.913
Or I'll drop you right here!

778
01:18:03.955 --> 01:18:05.206
You're a stinky girl!

779
01:18:08.543 --> 01:18:10.586
Bird-brain!

780
01:18:10.712 --> 01:18:12.963
That's enough!

781
01:18:13.048 --> 01:18:16.717
- Creep! - But he...
- Enough.


782
01:18:16.802 --> 01:18:19.303
I want no more.

783
01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:25.726
- Did you hit girls when you were little?
- Sure.


784
01:18:25.852 --> 01:18:28.229
See?

785
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.112
This black dragon,
with trees covered in lava.


786
01:18:37.197 --> 01:18:40.991
Here's the two-headed dragon phase...

787
01:18:41.076 --> 01:18:43.869
like he was divided.

788
01:18:43.995 --> 01:18:47.498
The two volcanoes:
One good and one bad.


789
01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:53.254
- This is him in the dragon's jaws.
- That's nice!


790
01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:56.006
- It's monstrous!
- No, look.


791
01:18:56.132 --> 01:19:00.594
Do you think he knows
Carlo and I have problems?


792
01:19:00.637 --> 01:19:04.265
What do you think,
should I leave my husband?


793
01:19:04.349 --> 01:19:06.600
Please, pay no attention to me.

794
01:19:06.643 --> 01:19:10.896
I'm not sitting here,
I'm in my apartments.


795
01:19:11.022 --> 01:19:13.023
Yes.

796
01:19:13.775 --> 01:19:17.653
- It's not true I'm an actor.
- No?


797
01:19:17.779 --> 01:19:22.533
I wanted to be, but I didn't
make it into the Academy.


798
01:19:24.035 --> 01:19:27.913
- I failed the audition.
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.


799
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.668
They were right, 
I was no good.

800
01:19:33.795 --> 01:19:37.047
But they took my sister.

801
01:19:39.926 --> 01:19:44.138
See, very strong,
he gets four points.


802
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.932
That was a wide-angle shot.

803
01:19:47.017 --> 01:19:50.311
He's trying to shoot...

804
01:19:50.937 --> 01:19:53.647
Point for South America!

805
01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:58.694
Point for Europe B!

806
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:10.205
We're not the casual,
senseless product of evolution.


807
01:20:10.332 --> 01:20:16.837
- Point for Africa!
- We're each the fruit of a thought of God.


808
01:20:16.963 --> 01:20:18.797
No, Gregori.

809
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:24.470
That's the terrible
beauty of Darwinism.


810
01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:28.223
Terrible: No sense in life.

811
01:20:28.308 --> 01:20:30.726
No consolation.

812
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:34.313
Point for Europe B.
Europe B 10...


813
01:20:34.356 --> 01:20:36.315
Oceania 0.

814
01:20:36.358 --> 01:20:40.819
This other one is more exciting
because it's more competitive.


815
01:20:40.862 --> 01:20:42.988
South America to serve.

816
01:20:43.114 --> 01:20:47.117
Africa 
- South America: 8 - 6.

817
01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.081
Oceania 0...

818
01:20:52.123 --> 01:20:54.249
Europe B 11.

819
01:20:55.126 --> 01:20:57.378
Point for South America!

820
01:20:58.588 --> 01:21:00.881
South America to serve.

821
01:21:05.971 --> 01:21:08.389
Point for Europe B. Oceania!

822
01:21:16.356 --> 01:21:18.524
The Holy Father!

823
01:21:39.546 --> 01:21:44.049
Too bad, it was such
an interesting case for me!


824
01:21:46.678 --> 01:21:50.431
But now I know who he is,
I can't do anything for him.


825
01:21:52.058 --> 01:21:54.018
Who knows how he feels?

826
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:58.939
Let's get back to it!

827
01:21:59.899 --> 01:22:03.193
Europe B and
South America to serve.


828
01:22:52.494 --> 01:22:54.620
Point for Africa!

829
01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.662
Ball!

830
01:23:37.539 --> 01:23:39.039
Serve!

831
01:23:41.668 --> 01:23:44.128
Change!

832
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.798
- Change!
- Change.


833
01:23:47.924 --> 01:23:50.801
Ribeck, Schindler, you seem tired.

834
01:23:50.885 --> 01:23:54.012
Scipioni and Bollati, you're in!

835
01:23:54.055 --> 01:23:56.640
- Me? No...
- Yes.


836
01:23:56.683 --> 01:23:58.183
I don't feel like it.

837
01:24:00.019 --> 01:24:01.687
Cardinal Cruz, again!

838
01:24:01.813 --> 01:24:03.438
Time out!

839
01:24:03.565 --> 01:24:06.942
I've told you when you are there...

840
01:24:07.026 --> 01:24:10.445
raise your hands!

841
01:24:12.198 --> 01:24:15.033
- I can't do it.
- Of course you can!


842
01:24:15.076 --> 01:24:17.953
Serve.

843
01:24:18.037 --> 01:24:22.541
- Europe B and Africa to serve.
- We can win!


844
01:24:23.668 --> 01:24:25.169
Concentrate.

845
01:24:25.211 --> 01:24:29.464
- Anyway you're lucky, you won't go to Hell.
- Good news.


846
01:24:29.549 --> 01:24:31.675
Point for South America!

847
01:24:31.718 --> 01:24:34.845
No one will, Hell is deserted.

848
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.725
Point.

849
01:24:42.353 --> 01:24:45.105
A comeback! A comeback!

850
01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:47.733
Point for Oceania!

851
01:24:47.817 --> 01:24:51.570
Europe B: 16. Oceania: 1.

852
01:26:02.058 --> 01:26:05.185
Let us welcome the word
that God gives us today.


853
01:26:05.311 --> 01:26:09.189
His words are for those of us...

854
01:26:09.315 --> 01:26:14.695
who carry in our hearts
desires, dreams, plans...


855
01:26:14.821 --> 01:26:17.030
but also worries...

856
01:26:17.073 --> 01:26:18.782
problems and fears...

857
01:26:18.825 --> 01:26:24.830
of all the things, maybe
what frightens us are these new times...


858
01:26:24.956 --> 01:26:28.709
the unprecedented situation,
the waiting...


859
01:26:28.835 --> 01:26:32.087
the length of which is unknown...

860
01:26:32.171 --> 01:26:36.091
but which asks us for a new heart...

861
01:26:36.175 --> 01:26:39.970
a new answer which God himself
suggests in these words:


862
01:26:40.096 --> 01:26:46.310
Humility, the wisdom
to recognize that we need God.


863
01:26:47.103 --> 01:26:50.981
We need His forgiveness,
His patience.


864
01:26:51.107 --> 01:26:54.985
We need to show our wounds to Him...

865
01:26:55.111 --> 01:26:57.863
because He is the only one
who can heal them.


866
01:27:10.376 --> 01:27:14.129
Holy Father,
we're behind in everything.


867
01:27:14.255 --> 01:27:19.009
You haven't yet indicated
the start of the new Pontificate.


868
01:27:19.093 --> 01:27:22.262
We understand how you feel...

869
01:27:22.347 --> 01:27:26.475
but you remember,
how, in years past...


870
01:27:26.517 --> 01:27:31.021
our beloved Pontiff
even when he was seriously ill...


871
01:27:31.105 --> 01:27:35.609
continued his pastoral commitment.

872
01:27:35.651 --> 01:27:39.654
Of course, we can't allow
more time to pass.


873
01:27:39.781 --> 01:27:43.033
In fact, I brought you
several sketches...


874
01:27:43.159 --> 01:27:47.287
for the Pontificate coat of arms.

875
01:27:47.413 --> 01:27:49.664
Here they are.

876
01:27:51.918 --> 01:27:54.503
Do any appeal to you?

877
01:27:56.672 --> 01:27:59.383
- This one.
- This one? - No, this one.


878
01:28:00.927 --> 01:28:04.554
It's simple, I think it's right.

879
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.765
- Are you sure?
- No.


880
01:28:13.898 --> 01:28:18.068
Holiness, you were right.

881
01:28:18.194 --> 01:28:21.321
You had to reflect, be by yourself...

882
01:28:21.447 --> 01:28:26.701
but now I beg you,
do an act of obedience to the Lord.


883
01:28:26.828 --> 01:28:29.204
Come back to us.

884
01:28:30.581 --> 01:28:33.792
A billion people are waiting for you.

885
01:28:36.087 --> 01:28:38.797
Can't we make me vanish?

886
01:28:40.216 --> 01:28:41.716
I disappear.

887
01:28:43.344 --> 01:28:46.847
All this never happened,
no one has ever seen me.


888
01:28:46.973 --> 01:28:49.975
No one will ever see me again,
I promise you.


889
01:28:51.727 --> 01:28:54.563
Let me go away, please.

890
01:29:15.376 --> 01:29:19.713
Guys, you must be kidding!

891
01:29:19.755 --> 01:29:23.091
Stop, you can't do this to me.

892
01:29:23.134 --> 01:29:27.721
We have to play the two semifinals!
Then the winners...


893
01:29:30.266 --> 01:29:32.392
The Holy Father is watching us.

894
01:29:32.477 --> 01:29:36.480
It's not right to leave him
without a winning team.


895
01:29:36.522 --> 01:29:38.523
It's not right!

896
01:29:38.649 --> 01:29:42.736
Pescardona, are you saying
it was all useless?


897
01:29:44.655 --> 01:29:49.534
South America is in the semifinals,
you're the tournament's revelation!


898
01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:52.412
You're in the semifinals.

899
01:29:52.497 --> 01:29:57.042
- Let's play this semifinal!
- Professor, there's no more time.


900
01:29:57.168 --> 01:29:59.419
Why?

901
01:30:09.305 --> 01:30:11.389
Good morning.

902
01:30:11.432 --> 01:30:15.310
Thank you for responding
to my invitation...


903
01:30:15.436 --> 01:30:20.565
but the situation
has become very serious.


904
01:30:23.444 --> 01:30:25.820
I can no longer be silent.

905
01:30:25.947 --> 01:30:28.448
No doubt I made a mistake...

906
01:30:29.784 --> 01:30:34.663
and I take full responsibility
for what I've done.


907
01:30:35.665 --> 01:30:41.711
I tried, for the good of all,
to resolve a very difficult situation.


908
01:30:42.922 --> 01:30:46.800
But in so doing, 
I lied to you.

909
01:30:51.097 --> 01:30:54.724
The Pope hasn't been here with us
for three days.


910
01:30:55.935 --> 01:30:57.852
He has gone.

911
01:31:02.692 --> 01:31:05.318
I know where he is.

912
01:31:07.113 --> 01:31:09.239
I ask you to forgive me.

913
01:31:09.365 --> 01:31:12.617
It's my fault so much time
has passed.


914
01:31:14.203 --> 01:31:21.334
The moment has come for all of you
to make a decision.


915
01:31:21.377 --> 01:31:24.004
Forgive me once again.

916
01:31:33.514 --> 01:31:38.268
Is anyone against this proposal?

917
01:31:45.776 --> 01:31:47.485
Thank you.

918
01:31:47.528 --> 01:31:48.737
In favor?

919
01:32:05.254 --> 01:32:06.671
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


920
01:32:11.385 --> 01:32:13.011
Thank you.

921
01:32:13.054 --> 01:32:16.806
Food poisoning, really nothing.

922
01:32:16.932 --> 01:32:20.935
Food poisoning, a negligible episode.

923
01:32:21.062 --> 01:32:25.148
- What did they put in that omelet?
- I don't know. - Food poisoning.


924
01:32:25.191 --> 01:32:27.817
- Nothing serious.
- Thanks. - Thank you.


925
01:32:46.962 --> 01:32:51.424
- Why do you wear black all the time?
- I'm in mourning for my life.


926
01:32:51.467 --> 01:32:54.844
- I'm unhappy.
- Why? You're healthy.


927
01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:58.973
Your father, although
he's not rich, is quite well off.


928
01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.935
I'm more miserable than you.

929
01:33:01.977 --> 01:33:04.354
I'm paid 23 rubles a month...

930
01:33:07.108 --> 01:33:11.486
I'm paid 23 rubles a month
and they take pension deductions.


931
01:33:11.612 --> 01:33:13.697
Still I don't wear mourning.

932
01:33:14.615 --> 01:33:17.117
Quiet!

933
01:33:17.952 --> 01:33:19.744
Money doesn't matter.

934
01:33:26.961 --> 01:33:30.630
Even a poor man can be happy.

935
01:33:30.756 --> 01:33:33.633
Yes, in theory, but not in reality.

936
01:33:33.759 --> 01:33:35.969
But not in reality.

937
01:33:36.971 --> 01:33:41.516
There's me, my mother,
my two sisters, my little brother...


938
01:33:41.642 --> 01:33:44.227
and 23 rubles...

939
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:47.021
23 rubles in all.

940
01:33:47.106 --> 01:33:50.150
We need to eat and drink!

941
01:33:50.276 --> 01:33:53.027
And tea?

942
01:33:53.154 --> 01:33:55.405
And tea...

943
01:33:57.658 --> 01:34:00.410
And sugar? And tobacco?

944
01:34:01.787 --> 01:34:03.621
Tobacco!

945
01:34:23.058 --> 01:34:24.893
- Now me?
- No!


946
01:34:24.935 --> 01:34:28.062
Treplyov, listening:
I hear footsteps.


947
01:34:28.147 --> 01:34:30.690
Enter the uncle, 
Treplyov embraces.

948
01:34:30.775 --> 01:34:33.526
"I cannot live without Nina."

949
01:34:33.569 --> 01:34:35.820
"I am madly happy!"

950
01:34:35.946 --> 01:34:39.908
He runs to meet Nina who enters.
Then with passion:


951
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:43.578
"My enchantress, my dream!"

952
01:34:43.704 --> 01:34:46.831
"I'm not late, am I?"

953
01:34:46.957 --> 01:34:50.293
Treplyov, kissing her hands:
"No, no..."


954
01:34:50.336 --> 01:34:53.963
Nina: "I've been in a fever all day."

955
01:34:54.048 --> 01:34:58.718
"I was afraid my father, but then..."

956
01:34:58.844 --> 01:35:01.596
".. he and my stepmother went out..."

957
01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.724
"..then I urged my horse!"

958
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:09.229
She squeezes Sorin's hands:

959
01:35:09.313 --> 01:35:11.856
"I'm so glad! So glad!"

960
01:38:18.919 --> 01:38:21.421
In these days...

961
01:38:24.174 --> 01:38:27.677
In these days
you must have asked yourselves...


962
01:38:27.803 --> 01:38:32.181
why doesn't our Pope
come to say hello?


963
01:38:33.058 --> 01:38:37.437
He mustn't worry
if the Lord chose him...


964
01:38:37.521 --> 01:38:40.148
He couldn't have made a mistake.

965
01:38:44.194 --> 01:38:46.654
Yes, I was chosen...

966
01:38:47.823 --> 01:38:50.324
but this...

967
01:38:50.409 --> 01:38:54.662
instead of giving me
strength and consciousness...


968
01:38:54.705 --> 01:38:58.458
it crushes me, confuses me.

969
01:39:03.464 --> 01:39:07.592
In this moment the Church needs
a guide who has the strength...


970
01:39:07.676 --> 01:39:12.096
to bring great changes...

971
01:39:12.222 --> 01:39:15.224
who seeks an encounter with all...

972
01:39:20.105 --> 01:39:24.984
who has, for all,
love and understanding.


973
01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:39.373
I ask the Lord's forgiveness
for what I am about to do.


974
01:39:39.458 --> 01:39:42.585
I don't know if
He will be able to forgive me.


975
01:39:45.881 --> 01:39:50.843
But I must speak to Him
and to you with sincerity.


976
01:39:53.514 --> 01:39:56.641
In these days I've thought
very much about you...


977
01:39:56.767 --> 01:40:01.145
and I realize I am not able...

978
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:05.149
to bear the role entrusted to me.

979
01:40:13.659 --> 01:40:17.912
I feel I am among those
who cannot lead...


980
01:40:17.996 --> 01:40:21.999
but who must be led.

981
01:40:25.754 --> 01:40:29.298
In this moment I can only say:

982
01:40:29.383 --> 01:40:31.759
Pray for me.

983
01:40:33.303 --> 01:40:37.807
The guide that you need
is not me.


984
01:40:39.309 --> 01:40:41.894
I can't be the one.
