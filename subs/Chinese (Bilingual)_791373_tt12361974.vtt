This is the first time it's gone quiet since the crack appeared.


146
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.930
也许它又继续沉睡
Maybe it's going back to sleep.


147
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.730
邪恶永不沉睡

148

只会伺机而待

有什么要来了

156

161
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.550
召集军团
Gather the legions!


162
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.640
跟她去
Go with her!


163
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.930
你必须封住山洞

用生命守护它

你救不了她

177

你救不了任何人

178
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.200
伟大的黑暗即将降临

179
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.330
亚马逊女战士

189
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.300
人类不会知道它的意义
Men won't know what it means.


190
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:51.510
人类不会知道
Men won't.


191
00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.680

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.920
很好
That's good.


196
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.070

找到另外两个

199
00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.000
一旦找到它们 就能形成三位一体

200
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.910
这个世界将加入其他世界

201
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.840
他会很高兴

202
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.920
再次看到我的价值

203
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.100
有酒类专卖店那小鬼的消息吗

可能有
Possibly.


205
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.640
"可能有"
"Possibly."


206
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.390
每听一次这句话
If I had a dollar for every "possibly."


207
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.190
就会让我更受不了你
Yeah, it would make you even more insufferable.


208
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.860
脸部辨识可能找到匹配
Facial scan might have got a hit on him,


209
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.860
搞消失的那小子

中城的巴里·艾伦先生

也许又是误判 你得给我多点时间
Might be another false positive, you'll have to give me a little time


212
00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.670
-才能确认 -我们没有时间了

韦恩少爷

214
00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.800
你一直在拼命地创建这个团队
you've been working as if there's no tomorrow to build this team


215
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:54.800
但却找不到任何队友
of people you can't even find.


216
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.090
我找到一个 是两个 包括戴安娜
I found one. I found two, including Diana.


217
00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.220
就因为莱克斯·卢瑟说 地球会受到攻击
Just because Lex Luthor says the planet's in danger of attack?


218
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.390
这跟莱克斯·卢瑟无关
This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor.


219
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.770
这跟他有关
It has to do with him.


220
00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.360
我在他的坟上向他承诺
I made a promise to him on his grave.


221
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.360
我花了很多时间试图造成分裂
I spent a lot of time trying to divide us.


222

现在必须团结一心才能拯救地球
I need to bring us together and make this right.


223
00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.700
卢瑟的警告已经过了一段时间
Well, it's been some time since Luthor's warning.


224
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:22.080
没有攻击 没有野蛮人冲进大门
No attacks. No barbarians at the gate.


225
00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.960
也许这些野蛮人不走大门
Maybe these barbarians don't use a gate.


226
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.500
也许他们已经来了
Maybe they're already here.


227

如昔日一般熊熊燃烧

241
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.820
让她看到历史曙光出现之前的黑暗

242
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.910

247
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.030
你每次都这么说
That's all you ever tell us.


248
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.160
没办法 我的生活很无趣
What can I do? I'm not that exciting.


249
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.790
你一走出去就好像消失一样
You might as well disappear when you walk out of here.


250
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:19.670
又来了
Again?


251
00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.710
-什么事 -又怎么了

当地居民和政府当局都感到诧异
This has baffled locals and government authorities alike


260

For example,


286
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:05.860
超人飞船
the Superman ship.


287
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.080
昨晚有八个人没离开实验室
Eight people never signed out of the lab last night, Doctor.


288
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:20.500
清洁工 警卫和几名研究科学家
Cleaning staff, guards, a few of your research scientists.


289
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:21.870
他们被绑架了
They were abducted.


290
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.250
你确定
Are you sure?


291
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.960
有位目击证人 他逃过一劫
Witness saw it all. He escaped.


292
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.260
他正在隔离区协助绘制嫌犯肖像画
He's here in quarantine now, working on an ID sketch.


293
00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.600
知道那会是谁或是什么东西吗
Any idea who or what that might be?


294
00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.790
母盒在这里不安全
The box isn't safe here.


295
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:03.750
维克多
Victor,


296
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.210
他们闯进实验室找它
they came looking for it at the lab.


297
00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.800
有些人被某种怪物抓走
People were taken by some kind of monster or something.


298
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.510
你对怪物很了解…
You know a lot about monsters,


299
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.550
对吧
don't you?


300
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.060
尤其是怎么制造它们
Especially how to make 'em.


301
00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.290
求救…求救…
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!


302
00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.170
船身受损 我快沉下去了
My hull is breached. I'm going down.


303
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:42.470
求救
Mayday!


304
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.720
有人吗
Is there anybody out there?


305
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.390
威士忌
Whiskey.


306
00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.060
下次叫他要敬畏暴风雨
Tell him to respect the storm next time.


307
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:48.240
他请客
It's on him.


308
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.560
本应是国王的男人
King who would be man.


309
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.890
人类父亲和海洋女王的儿子
Son of a human father and Queen of the Seas.


310
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:24.520
我浪费了多少时间
All the time I've wasted


311
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:27.730
试图遵守我向你母亲做的承诺
trying to keep the promise I made to your mother.


312
00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.070
说完了吗 老头
Are you finished, old man?


313
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.700
虽然你居无定所
You never sleep in the same place twice,


314
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.620
但还是一直回来这里
yet you keep coming back here.


315
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.540
我喜欢这里 很安静
I like it. It's quiet.


316
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.500
这是你继承的王国
It's your inheritance.


317
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.790
你应当是亚特兰蒂斯国王
You're the rightful king of Atlantis.


318
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.040
我们的同胞受苦受难
Our people suffer.


319
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:49.170
你的同胞
Your people.


320
00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:52.880
一个卑鄙残忍 迷信无知的种族
A brutal, petty, superstitious race.


321
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:54.260
地表有什么不同吗
Is the surface any different?


322
00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.390
没人说我是地表之王
Nobody calls me King of the Surface.


323
00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.180
你想要什么 维科
What do you want, Vulko?


324
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:03.640
要塞附近的守卫不断消失不见
Guards near the stronghold have been disappearing.


325
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.230
来自天上的掠夺者
Snatchers from above.


326
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.610
去跟欧姆国王说啊
Talk to King Orm.


327
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.190
-你弟弟 -表弟
-Your brother? -Half-brother.


328
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.360
他想煽动和陆地人类的战争
He's trying to fan the flames of war with the surface.


329
00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.150
他说谎
He lies.


330
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.620
掠夺者来自黑暗之境 他们在寻找它
The snatchers have come from the dark place. They're looking for it.


331
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:22.790
我们守护的母盒并不安全
The Mother Box our people guard is not safe.


332
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:27.790
前往亚特兰蒂斯要塞 保护母盒
Go to the stronghold of Atlantis. Protect the box.


333
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:30.000
时候到了
The time has come.


334
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.130
把你母亲的三叉戟拿去
Take up your mother's trident.


335
00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:48.980
你不能永远弃世界而不顾 亚瑟
You can't turn your back on the world forever, Arthur.


336
00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.990
不管是地表或海底
Above or below.


337
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.680
狄萨德
DeSaad.


338
00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:27.810
狄萨德 我呼叫你
DeSaad! I call to thee.


339
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:41.030
荒原狼 你开始征服这世界了吗
Steppenwolf, have you begun the conquest?


340
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.540
这个世界是分裂的
This world is divided.


341
00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:46.830
他们是原始物种
They are a primitive species.


342
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.330
未进化并与彼此战争
Unevolved and at war with one another.


343
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.340
歧见太深无法团结一心
Too separate to be one.


344
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.760
必须像其他的世界一样 剥夺他们的自由意志
Their free will must be ripped from them, like the other worlds.


345
00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.050
并以服膺他的光荣信念…
Given absolution in one glorious belief,


346
00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.930
获得赦免
to serve him.


347
00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.640
母盒呢
The Mother Boxes?


348
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.140
我找到其中一个
I have found one of the three.


349
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.770
苏醒后呼唤我的那一个
The one that woke and called to me.


350
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.440
另外两个仍然沉睡
The other two still sleep,


351
00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:17.440
但天启魔感应到它们
but the parademons feel their presence.


352
00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:19.070
它们飞来飞去
They fly,


353
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.820
到处搜索 并抓走带有母盒气味的囚犯
they search, they take prisoners who carry the scent,


354
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:27.910
我则以他之名创建一座要塞
while I build a stronghold in the name of his glory.


355
00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.330
很好
Yes.


356
00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.090
强大的荒原狼
Mighty Steppenwolf,


357
00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:39.970
你本来可以与伟大的他平起平坐
who might have sat here by the side of the great one.


358
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:46.470
但却因自大而被放逐
But undone by his self-pride.


359
00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.020
狄萨德
DeSaad...


360
00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.480
我跪倒在你面前
I fall before you.


361
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:55.020
让我向他求情
Let me make a plea to him


362
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.110
当我以他之名夺下这世界
that I may come home


363
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.070
能否请他让我回家
after I take this world in his name.


364
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.660
你背叛了他
You betrayed him.


365
00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:05.580
你自己的家人
Your own family.


366
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.950
我看到我犯的错误
I saw my mistake.


367
00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.710
我屠杀企图争夺他王位的人
I slaughtered those who sought his throne.


368
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:16.000
你还欠他五万个世界
You still owe the great one 50,000 more worlds.


369
00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:18.920
当你还清了债
He will hear your plea


370
00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.630
他就会聆听你的恳求
when you pay your debt.


371
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:27.600
母盒将被寻获并合而为一
The Mother Boxes will be found and united.


372
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.680
这里没有保护者
No protectors here.


373
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:34.270
没有绿光战警 没有氪星人
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.


374
00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:38.070
这世界将会像其他的一样沦陷
This world will fall, like all the others.


375
00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:40.860
为了达克赛德
For Darkseid.


376
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.280
为了达克赛德
For Darkseid.


377
00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:11.140
我花了几百万元安装保全系统
You know, I paid millions of dollars for this building's security.


378
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.600
钱花得很值得
You got your money's worth.


379
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.480
我几乎花了一分钟才解除
Took me almost a minute to disable it.


380
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.360
你好
Hi there.


381
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:21.030
新玩具
A new toy?


382
00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.110
原型军队运输机
Prototype troop carrier.


383
00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:29.450
我曾相识的一个人会很想开开看
I once knew a man who would have loved to fly it.


384
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.040
韦恩航天最顶尖的人才 都无法让它飞起来
The best minds at Wayne Aerospace couldn't make it fly.


385
00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.710
但是你能
But you can?


386
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:37.540
我别无选择
I have no choice.


387
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:40.460
我需要更远的航程和更大的货舱
I need more range and I need more cargo.


388
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:42.210
我认为一场攻击即将来袭
I think there's an attack coming.


389
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.380
你错了 布鲁斯
Not coming, Bruce.


390
00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.140
它已经来袭了
It's already here.


391
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:52.470
据我所知 他们来自另一个宇宙
From what I've learned, they are things from another universe.


392
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.980
为一个黑暗力量效忠
They serve a dark power.


393
00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.850
一个古老的力量
An old power.


394
00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.440
他们想要什么
What do they want?


395
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.610
入侵地球 征服世界
To invade. To conquer.


396
01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:06.990
他们很久以前曾经来过
They came here once before, long ago.


397
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.540
一支庞大的舰队出现在天空
A great armada appeared in the sky,


398
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:17.330
消灭所有胆敢反抗的势力
laying waste to all who opposed it.


399
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.590
入侵者的首领是达克赛德
The leader of the invaders was a being called Darkseid.


400
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:26.010
这名字在每个宇宙都受到诅咒和畏惧
A name cursed and feared in every universe.


401
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.720
地球的守护者 和达克赛德展开一场大战
Darkseid was met in battle by Earth's defenders.


402
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.390
旧神族 人类
The old gods, men...


403
01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:37.100
被迫迁至海底之前的亚特兰蒂斯族
Atlanteans before their descent into the sea...


404
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.400
遭背叛及被困禁之前的亚马逊族
Amazons before their betrayal and enslavement


405
01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:45.940
以及来自星空的守护者
and guardians from the stars.


406
01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.700
他们的历史教导他们 不能相信彼此
Their histories had taught them not to trust each other,


407
01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:52.030
不能奢望创建联盟
not to hope for an alliance.


408
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.200
而是各自奋战
To fight apart.


409
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.960
当达克赛德在地球发动战争
As Darkseid waged war on Earth,


410
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:47.550
他发现一个秘密
he found a secret there.


411
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:51.470
隐藏在无垠太空的一股力量
A power hidden in the infinity of space.


412
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.140
他召唤暗黑秘士
He called forth mystics


413
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.430
他们崇拜并控制三个物体
who worshipped and controlled three objects...


414
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.640
母盒
the Mother Boxes.


415
01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.390
等等
Wait, wait, wait.


416
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560
"母盒"
"Mother Boxes"?


417
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:03.270
坚不可摧 活生生的机器
Indestructible living machines,


418
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:08.900
使用先进无比的科技打造 看起来简直就像巫术
made from a science so advanced, it looks like sorcery.


419
01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:11.700
若要征服世界 三个母盒必须同步化
To conquer, three boxes have to synchronize


420
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.120
合而为一后形成三位一体
and join together into The Unity.


421
01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.330
三位一体以烈火净化星球
The Unity cleanses a planet with fire,


422
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.080
将它转换成另一个敌人世界
transforming it into a copy of the enemy's world.


423
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:25.750
幸存者都成为达克赛德的仆役
All who live become servants of Darkseid.


424
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.840
活着 但毫无生机
Alive but drained of life.


425
01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:30.380
天启魔
Parademons.


426
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:33.680
亚马逊女战士
-Amazons!


427
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.270
冲啊
With me!


428
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.090
但在三位一体同步化之前
But before The Unity could synchronize,


429
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.640
地球的守护者组成统一阵线展开反击
the defenders of Earth attacked and fought as one.


430
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.220
亚马逊人和亚特兰蒂斯人并肩作战
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.


431
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:24.900
宙斯及他儿子阿瑞斯 和来自星空的守护者联手出击
Zeus and his son Ares alongside the guardians from the sky.


432
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:30.570
一群黄金时代英雄为了捍卫地球 同心协力捍卫了地球的生命
A golden Age of Heroes fighting together to defend life on Earth.


433
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:30.020
他们做到其他世界做不到的事
They did what no world had ever done.


434
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:32.360
将敌人送回星空
Sent the enemies back into the stars.


435
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.150
三个母盒从未合而为一
The three Mother Boxes never synchronized.


436
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.910
也从未形成三位一体
-The Unity never came to pass.


437
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:44.280
但在敌人撤退之时
But, in their retreat,


438
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:48.040
母盒被留在地球
the boxes were left behind on Earth.


439
01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:51.920
它们的力量变弱 就像失去主人的恶犬
They grew weak. Dogs without masters


440
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.340
开始沉睡
falling asleep,


441
01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.970
等待他们的回归
awaiting their return.


442
01:05:58.130 --> 01:06:00.470
母盒从敌人的视野中消失
Fading from the view of the enemy,


443
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.800
隐匿在一兆个世界之中
anonymous among a trillion worlds.


444
01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.870
地球的守护者立下誓言
The defenders of Earth made a vow.


445
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.490
人类 亚特兰蒂斯族及亚马逊族
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.


446
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.540
根据他们文化的惯例及仪式
Each would enshrine and guard one of the three sleeping Mother Boxes


447
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:35.210
各自封存并守卫 其中一个沉睡的母盒
according to the rites and rituals of their culture


448
01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.840
以防母盒日后再次苏醒 向天启星发出信号
in case a box should ever wake again to call out to the planet Apokolips


449
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:41.760
呼唤敌人回来并企图征服
to return and conquer


450
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:45.720
达克赛德唯一落败而逃的世界
the only world Darkseid had ever lost.


451
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:04.340
有什么唤醒了我的族人守卫的母盒
Something woke the box my people guard.


452
01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:07.090
它向暗黑之处呼唤
It called out to the dark place...


453
01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.680
引来达克赛德手下的一名征服者
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.


454
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.470
敌人已经来袭
The enemy is here.


455
01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.640
如果是真的 他在哪里
If he's here, where is he?


456
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:16.900
他会到处寻找另外两个母盒
He'll be searching for the other two boxes.


457
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.020
得到三个母盒并准备好之前 他仍在藏匿
Hiding until he has all three. Until he's ready.


458
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:24.030
我们必须准备迎敌 你 我和其他人
Then we have to be ready. You, me, the others.


459
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.610
他们说英雄时代不会再来临
They said the Age of Heroes would never come again.


460
01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.030
会来的
No, it will.


461
01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:31.080
必须的
It has to.


462
01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:36.330
其他人 他们在哪里
The others. Where are they?


463
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.680
第三章

464
01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.680
挚爱的母亲，挚爱的儿子

中城

467
01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:57.600
前方减速

468
01:08:58.350 --> 01:09:01.020
我迟到了吗 我大迟到了
Am I late? No, I'm so late. I'm very late.


469
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.190
中城狗狗托儿所

470
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.480
你好啊 小家伙
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.


471
01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.150
不行
-Oh. No.


472
01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.820
好吧 晚点见
Okay, bye. Okay.


473
01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.620
真是拍谢
-I'm so sorry.


474
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:12.280
我迟到了
I'm late.


475
01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:18.830
-你是… -我…
-Are you, uh... -I'm...


476
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.250
抱歉我大迟到了 不是故意的
I'm so sorry I'm so late. I didn't mean to be so late.


477
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.920
我是我 我来了 很抱歉迟到了
I'm me and I'm here and I'm so sorry I'm late.


478
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.260
因为公车没来 后来来了
Essentially, the bus didn't come, then the bus did come,


479
01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.720
不过有个阿婆一直在找硬币
but then there was this old woman counting change for the fare,


480
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.010
五分 一分 五分 一分
like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny.


481
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.930
真是够了 让阿婆上车吧
Like, jeez Louise, let this woman on the bus.


482
01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:32.100
她都107岁了
She's 107 years old,


483
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.930
不会再活多久了

拜托
Come on.


488
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:47.070
那是法文来着
From the French, of course.


489
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.280
"履历"是过去分词…
"Resume," I believe, is a past participle of...


490
01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.200
这可不妙
Uh, wow. That's no good.


491
01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.870
我的口袋有什么 "有只吃纸的怪物"
It's like, what lives in my pocket, right? "Paper monster hungry." Uh...


492
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.840

你说你有遛狗的经验

496
01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.780
天啊 希望大家都没事
Oh, gosh, I hope everyone's okay.

瞧 照顾狗狗遇到事情 我一定会随身携带肉类零食
See, in times of crisis, for dog work, I always bring a meat snack.


498
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.080
能让狗狗安静下来
'Cause it makes them feel calm.


499
01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.120
你永远不知道会发生什么事
'Cause you never know what's going to happen in this city.


500
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:27.000
我是说 天啊

是不是星期一开工吗

502
01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.710
你一定靠近过母盒
You have been near a Mother Box.


503
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.920
身上有它的气味
The scent is on you.


504
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.750
它在哪里
Where is it?


505
01:14:16.170 --> 01:14:19.050
亚特兰蒂斯族的儿女绝不会告诉你
No son or daughter of Atlantis will ever tell you.


506
01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:37.480
我们的族人看守了母盒数千年
Our people have guarded the Mother Box for thousands of years.


507
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:46.290
我不会背叛自己的族人
I will never betray my own people.


508
01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.340
你已经背叛了
You already have.


509
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.900
这是在地球最深的海沟拍到的
This was taken in the deepest trench on Earth.


510
01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:05.570
他一定是亚特兰蒂斯人

能够呼吸海水

我跟他说话时他呼吸空气
He was breathing air when I talked to him.


513
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:10.660
那他就是混血儿
Mixed-blood, then.


514
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:12.700
他说他会和我们一起作战
He said he'll fight with us?


515
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:14.210
或多或少吧
More or less.


516

或多还是或少
More more or more less?


517

大概是或少吧

亚特兰蒂斯人很难搞

我的族人曾和他们打仗
My people went to war with them once.


521
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:30.100
我不确定我们能相信他
I'm not sure we can trust him.


522
01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:31.310
戴安娜 如果我们要合作
Diana, if we're gonna do this,


523
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:33.810
你就得打开心房 接受我们不能…
you're gonna need to be open to more things that we didn't...

他只是不会表达 但是…

斯通博士 很遗憾

维克多 你不必窝在这里

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.160
你不必给我第二次机会 但是要给自己再一次机会
you don't have to give me a second chance, but give yourself one.


579
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.250
如果你不想看着我
If you can't stand looking at me,

那就试着听我说

你现在的能力 维克多

超强力量只是冰山一角
Your physical strength is just the tip of the iceberg.


583
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:30.420
你拥有无穷潜力

584
01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:05.370
在一和零的数位世界 你是绝对的霸主

从电厂电网到电信设备

每个人的生活都受到

590
01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:21.380
复杂的数位网络操控支配
and dominated by complex digital networks


591
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:25.640
你却能轻而易举掌控它

592
01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:40.490
全世界的命运掌握在你手中
The fate of the world will literally rest in your hands.


593
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:53.330
你只要动个念头 就能发射所有的核弹
Its entire nuclear arsenal, you could launch with a thought.


594
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:07.300
全球复杂的金融体系
The world's monetary systems and its complex interactions


595
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:11.930
对你来说就像玩具一样能轻易玩弄
will seem as easy to manipulate for you as a child's plaything.

问题是…不 挑战是…
The question... No, the challenge


597
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.060
不去这么做

598
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:55.810
不去滥用这能力
It will be not doing.


599
01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:57.980
不去监视每个人

600
01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.320
这个重责大任的沉重负担
It is the burden of this responsibility


601
01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.780
将塑造你成为什么样的人

602
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:38.480
许个愿
Now, make a wish.


603

你好 外婆
Hi, Grandma!


606
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.170
余额不足

607
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:45.090
恭喜

612
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:01.730
维克多
Victor...


613
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.730
这是我身为一名科学家 做出来的推断
Victor, these are the words and deductions of a scientist.


614
01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.070
也是我一直以来跟你说话的方式
That's how I've been speaking to you.


615
01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:11.780
现在…
Now,


616
01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.830
让我说出内心话 不是身为一个科学家
let me speak to you from my heart, not as a scientist,


617
01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:19.580
而是身为一个父亲
as a father.


618
01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:35.050
喂
Hey.


619
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:37.850

620
01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.660
因为你没有发挥潜力

621
01:27:57.330 --> 01:28:00.370
一直在原地打转
holding yourself back.


622
01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.710
你打三份没出路的工
You're going in circles, man. Holding down three dead-end jobs,


623
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:05.500
还要打第四份工 你哪来的时间
going on four. Where do you even find the time?


624
01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:06.790
我会挪出时间
I make the time.


625
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.090
-只要再打一份工 -巴里
-I just need one more gig... -Barry.


626
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:09.880
-就能自己付学费 -你不能
...then I'm gonna pay for my own tuition. You can't.

01:28:10.050 --> 01:28:12.760
-我说到做到 -别再折磨自己了
Like I always said I would. You cannot keep doing this to yourself.

我不想再谈这件事
Okay. I really don't wanna talk about this again.

拜托 我们有十分钟

为了什么
For what?


633
01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:23.440
那还用问 我正在跟我爸讲话
Huh, let's see. As I talk to my father,


634
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.400
他因为杀死我妈坐牢 其实是被冤枉的
who's still in prison for the murder of my mother, which he didn't commit.


635
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.520
我怎么会对刑事司法感兴趣
Yeah, how did I get interested in criminal justice?


636
01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:30.230
我不记得了
I can't remember.


637
01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.320

我注定要选择走这条路 爸
This path has clearly chosen me, Dad.

我也要你别再来看我
And I want you to stop coming to see me.


644
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:07.900
我拖累了你的人生
I am a drag on your life.


645

你知道对我来说怎样才是最好吗

我儿子不白白浪费生命
My son not wasting his life.

I can't sit here and watch you run in place in Central City


653

哪儿都不能去的老头子
who's not going anywhere.


655

-爸 并不是这样 -时间到了
-Dad, that's not true. -It's time.

01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:18.690
太好了
Great. Great.


698
01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:20.980
我能留着吗
Can I keep this?


699
01:33:21.610 --> 01:33:25.200
那就像是一层三次元现实 似乎能够操控时空
It's like this layer of dimensional reality, and it seems to manipulate space-time.


700
01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.570
我称之为神速力
I call it the Speed Force.


701
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:28.570
害我燃烧大量的卡路里
Causes me to burn a tremendous amount of calories


702
01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.370
所以我是零食的黑洞
so I am just a black hole of snacks.


703
01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.370
我是"零"洞
I am a snack hole.


704
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:37.080
这个特殊战斗团队有几个人
How many people are on this special fight team?


705
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:39.170
-三个 包括你 -三个
-Three, including you. -Three?


706
01:33:39.330 --> 01:33:41.210
对抗什么
Against what?


707
01:33:42.090 --> 01:33:43.550
上飞机再告诉你
I'll tell you on the plane.


708
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:45.380
飞机
Plane?


709
01:33:46.050 --> 01:33:47.800
你的超能力是什么来着
What are your superpowers again?


710
01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:49.680
我超有钱
I'm rich.


711
01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.580
普林斯小姐 让我来
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.


712
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.750
没关系 我自己来
No, that's okay. I can do it myself.


713
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.420
你想要喝吗
Would you like to have some?


714
01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:20.880
不 谢了
Uh, no, thank you.


715
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:24.250
你得先倒水进去
If you put the water in first.


716
01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.970
-当然了 -才不会把茶叶烫熟
-Of course. -So we don't scald the tea.


717
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:32.430
-很好 -太好了
-Yes. -Great.


718
01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.560
茶叶应该够多了
No, that's probably enough tea.


719
01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.100
好吧
All right.


720
01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:38.730
你确定不来一杯
Are you sure you don't wanna have some?


721
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:42.150
不 谢了 你得再让茶叶浸泡一下
I won't, thank you. And then leave it to mash.


722
01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:45.690
我会的 一定会
I will. I will, definitely will.


723
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:48.200
你在打造什么
Uh... What are you working on?


724
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.700
这是一只手套
It's a gauntlet


725
01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.910
布满高分子太阳能奈米电池

726
01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.290
来 让我秀给你看
-Wow. -Here, let me show you.


727
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:59.790
这是从氪星侦察舰上借来的
We borrowed this from the Kryptonian scout ship.


728
01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:02.830
也许你应该…
Oh, maybe you should, uh...


729
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.460
-挪过去一点 谢谢 -没问题

捕捉并消散能量的手套

这是韦恩少爷的点子
It's Master Wayne's idea.


735
01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:26.480
也许你也应该打造一条套索
Maybe you should work on a lasso, too?


736
01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:28.400
当然是黑色的罗
-In black, of course. -Oh.


737

好吧 维克多斯通

搜寻维克多·斯通

739
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:57.470
有点不对劲
Something is not working.


740
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.400
在这里见面 现在

741
01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.700
看来你有个约会 普林斯小姐
Looks like you have a date, Miss Prince.


742
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.840
你为什么找我 戴安娜
Why are you looking for me, Diana?


743
01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:13.260
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.


744
01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.760
我知道的远远超乎你想像
I know more than you can possibly imagine.


745
01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:18.510
那也许你已经知道我需要你的帮助
Then maybe you already know I need your help.


746
01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.180
全世界都需要
The world does.


747
01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.270
去他的全世界
Fuck the world.


748
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:27.270
你很显然经历了很多
You've obviously been through a great deal.


749
01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:31.020
我完全无法想像
I can't begin to imagine what.


750
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:35.110
但不管你发生什么事 现在都拥有超能力
But whatever happened to you, you have gifts now.


751
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.070
超能力
Gifts?


752
01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.410
这看起来像是超能力吗
What part of this looks like a gift to you?


753
01:37:39.570 --> 01:37:40.740
我们需要你 维克多
We need you, Victor.


754
01:37:41.410 --> 01:37:43.000
也许你也需要我们
And maybe you need us.


755
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.830
我不需要任何人
I don't need anyone.


756
01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.080
不再需要了
Not anymore.


757
01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:50.750
我以前也一直这么告诉自己
I told myself the same for a long time.


758
01:37:57.590 --> 01:38:00.300
我曾经失去一个深爱的人
I lost someone I loved once.


759
01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:07.980
把自己封闭起来
I shut myself off from everyone.


760
01:38:09.610 --> 01:38:12.320
但我得学会再次敞开心房
But I had to learn to open back up again.


761
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:18.450
老实说 我仍在努力中
The truth is, I'm still working on it.


762
01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:21.830
既然你要求见我
And if you asked to meet me...


763
01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:25.450
你也在努力
you're working on it, too.

You were right about the metal sample from the Superman ship.

这是地球上最火热的东西
You're looking at the hottest thing on Earth.


773
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:10.730
跟我对毕业舞会舞伴说的话一样
Exact words I said to my prom date.


774
01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.640
但她还是甩了我
She dumped me anyway.


775
01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:14.020
是啊
Yeah.

You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

不
No...


780
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:32.460
我不这么认为
I don't.


781
01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.370
维克多
Oh, Victor.


782
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:28.430

还真是个圣人
What a saint.


829
01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.700
你胆敢讽刺亚特兰娜女王
You dare speak of Queen Atlanna that way?


830
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:51.500
你的女王把我丢在我父亲家门口
Your queen left me on my father's doorstep


831
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:53.250
从此把我忘得一干二净

你母亲是为了救你才离开

834
01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.840
她也付出惨痛代价
What it cost her.


835
01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:06.260
但你现在不是脆弱的小孩
But you're not a defenseless child now.


836
01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:10.270
那本是她的责任
It would have been her responsibility


837
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:13.600
跟着那怪物到陆地 然后阻止他
to follow that monster to the surface and stop him.


838
01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:15.270
现在
Now,


839
01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.900
是你的责任
it's yours.


840
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:23.710
太好了
Yes.


841
01:50:46.650 --> 01:50:48.030
荒原狼
Steppenwolf,


842
01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.120
告诉我你知道了什么
tell me what you've learned.


843
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.910
找到两个苏醒的母盒
Two boxes found and awake.


844
01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:56.040
结合两个母盒的力量
With the combined power of the two Mother Boxes,


845
01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:59.210
我完成了要塞的防御系统
I've been able to finish the stronghold's defenses.


846
01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:01.790
第三个母盒在哪里
Where is the third Mother Box?


847
01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:06.090
天启魔感应到它 正在寻找它
The parademons sense its presence and search for the third.


848
01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:07.260
它们抓来了囚犯
They have taken prisoners


849
01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.510
他们带有它的气味
who carry its scent.


850
01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:11.300
去吧
Go.


851
01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.060
去审问囚犯
Interrogate the prisoners.


852
01:51:14.850 --> 01:51:16.730
找到第三个母盒
Find the third.


853
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:20.440
他们会乖乖告诉我
They will tell me what they know,


854
01:51:21.690 --> 01:51:24.190
不然我就来硬的
or I will rip it from them.


855
01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:35.080
第四章

856
01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:35.080
“改造机器”

857
01:52:07.530 --> 01:52:09.110
你们有多少人
How many of you are there?


858
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:11.070
还不够多
Not enough.


859
01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.410
哥谭市各地有数十名目击者
Dozens of witnesses all over Gotham.


860
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:18.290
他们的描述符合大都会绑架案的嫌犯
Description matches the suspect in the Metropolis abductions.


861
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:19.910
天启魔
Parademons.


862
01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:21.790
好吧
Okay.


863
01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.290
天启魔一定闻到母盒的气味
The demons must have caught the scent of a Mother Box.


864
01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:25.540
在实验室的那个
At the lab.


865
01:52:25.710 --> 01:52:28.050
它们把人抓走 拷问母盒下落
They carried people away to find out what they know.


866
01:52:28.210 --> 01:52:29.920
-那八个人可能还活着 -九个人
So the eight may still be alive. Nine.


867
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:34.970
星辰实验室的主任今晚被绑走
The head of STARLABS was taken tonight.


868
01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:42.730
好吧 另一个科学家
Wow, okay. So, another scientist.


869
01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:44.190
我们要怎么找到他
So, how do we find him?


870
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:46.020
附近一定有它们的巢穴
There must be a nest nearby.


871
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:50.280
我在大都会和哥谭市地图上做记号
I plotted all the sightings in Metropolis, Gotham.


872
01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.570
看不出任何模式
No discernable pattern I can see.


873
01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:54.030
地图上的路线没有交集
The lines on the map don't converge.


874
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.530
在陆地上没有
On land.


875
01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:58.290
这是在两座城市之间的史崔克岛
These lead back to Stryker's Island, between the two cities.


876
01:52:58.450 --> 01:53:00.870
这些是通风口 全都通往1929年
These are air vents. They all lead down to the tunnel


877
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.420
废弃的大都会工程隧道
to a Metropolis project that was abandoned in '29.


878
01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:05.170
巢穴可能在那里
The nest could be there.


879
01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:07.880
他要跟我们一起去吗
Uh, is he coming with us now,


880
01:53:08.050 --> 01:53:09.380
因为你的车子坐不下
because we're not all gonna fit in your car.


881
01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.340
我有更大的玩意儿
I have something bigger.


882
01:53:12.670 --> 01:53:14.300
你真的觉得…
Do you really think that...


883
01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:19.180
他们就这样闪人了吗
Oh, wow, they just... They really just vanish, huh?


884
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:21.730
太没礼貌了
Oh. That's rude.


885
01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:00.260
星辰实验室

886
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:02.520
很接近了
We're close.


887
01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:04.690
敌人的气味
The scent of the enemy.


888
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:06.560
虚无
Of absence.


889
01:54:07.150 --> 01:54:08.690
黑暗
Darkness.


890
01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.400
死亡
Death.


891
01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:13.070
-我们在哪里 阿尔弗雷德 -史崔克岛
Where are we, Alfred? Stryker's Island.


892
01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:17.780
你们应该就在隧道通风塔的正下方
You should be directly under the venting tower for the tunnel.


893
01:54:18.370 --> 01:54:21.790
往左看 应该有一道阶梯通往机械室
Now look to your left, you'll see a staircase to the machine room.


894
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:24.540
红外线热影像显示有一群人
Thermal scan shows a cluster of people there.


895
01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:25.620
就是那里
That's it.


896
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
走吧
Let's go.


897
01:54:41.010 --> 01:54:41.850
好吧
Right.


898
01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.930
有任何计划吗
Is there... Is there a plan?


899
01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:46.770
你们两个
Either of you?


900
01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:48.100
别单打独斗
Don't engage alone.


901
01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:50.150
我们要联手出击
We do this together.


902
01:54:59.110 --> 01:55:00.950
我听说过你
I heard about you.


903
01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:03.910
没想到你是真的
Didn't think you were real.


904
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:05.910
有用的时候我就是真的
I'm real when it's useful.


905
01:55:16.170 --> 01:55:20.300
我受够了你们的沉默 快告诉我 母盒在哪里
I grow tired of your silence. Now tell me, where is the Mother Box?


906
01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:29.310
求求你 我们有家人
Please. We have families.


907
01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:31.560
那你们就有弱点
Then you have weakness.


908
01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:33.190
荒原狼
Steppenwolf.


909
01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.530
好吧 我猜…那就是坏蛋
Okay, I'm guessing that's the bad guy.


910
01:55:37.690 --> 01:55:38.740
猜对了
Good guess.


911
01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.740
我现在真的超想念超人
I'm really, really missing Superman right now.


912
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:45.080
绕到另一边
Circle to the other side.


913
01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.250
把它们团团围住展开突袭
We'll surround them and surprise him.


914
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:53.380
你接近过一个母盒
You have been near a Mother Box.


915
01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.550
身上有它的气味
The scent is on you.


916
01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:57.170
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.


917
01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:59.170
-它在哪里 -放过他
-Where is it? -Leave him alone!


918
01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:01.590
他不知道
He... He doesn't know.


919
01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:06.970
等等 求求你
Wait, please, please!


920
01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:15.270
你也带着气味 但是更强烈
You carry the scent, too. But stronger.


921
01:56:15.650 --> 01:56:17.780
我死也不会告诉你
I will die before I tell you.


922
01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.780
不告诉我就会死
You'll die if you don't.


923
01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:21.200
不
No!


924
01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:31.580
维克多

925
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:33.040
杀了他们
Kill them both.


926
01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:38.670
亚马逊女战士
Ah, Amazon.


927
01:56:39.090 --> 01:56:41.590
但不像你的姐妹
But not like your sisters.


928
01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.010
你更强大
Stronger.


929
01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.580
亚马逊女战士
Amazon.


930
01:57:18.630 --> 01:57:20.010
住手
Hold!


931
01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:22.590
这一个是我的
This one will be mine.


932
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:26.970
我不属于任何人
I belong to no one.


933
01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:43.030
大伙儿 这不是联手出击
Guys, this is not together.


934
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.200
把这些人救出去
Help get those people out of here.


935
01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:53.040
我会让这些怪物跟着我
I'll make sure these things follow me.


936
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:04.880
大伙儿 快啊
Everybody, move!


937
01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:15.140
再快一点
A little quicker.


938
01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:18.900
-没事吧 -没事

这里
This way.


941
01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:02.270
能量正在消散
The energy is dissipating.


942
01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:03.940
我的手套很有用
My gauntlet worked!


943
01:59:05.190 --> 01:59:07.490
晚点再庆祝 阿尔弗雷德 我需要夜蝠战机
Celebrate later, Alfred. I need the Nightcrawler.


944
01:59:07.650 --> 01:59:09.280
我以为你不会开口
Thought you'd never ask.


945
01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:11.990
马上赶去 启动遥控模式
Crawler's on the way. Initiating remote mode.


946
01:59:42.150 --> 01:59:43.150
谢了 阿尔弗雷德
Thank you, Alfred.


947
01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.730
不客气
Don't mention it.


948
02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:08.420
惨了
No!


949
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:17.890
他们安全了 回去隧道
They're safe. Get back to the tunnel.

952
02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.200
系统全面故障

955
02:02:12.670 --> 02:02:16.180
你身上流着旧神族的血液
You have the blood of the old gods in you.


956

957
02:02:33.490 --> 02:02:35.110
我不确定你会来
Wasn't sure you'd come.


958
02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:37.450
你是我父亲
You're my father.


959
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:41.950
快去吧

我认识你吗

963
02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.010
我们在哪里的下面
What are we under, right now?


964
02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.050
哥谭港
Gotham Harbor.


965
02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:02.050
那是谁
Who is that?

让我看

970
02:07:26.650 --> 02:07:28.280
它在这里
It is here.


971
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:31.990
在这个世界
On this world.


972
02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:08.860
你可能感染了外星微生物 必须接受隔离
Sir, you're gonna be in quarantine for possible alien microbes.


973
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:10.700
美国政府的规定要求…
U.S. government protocols require that...


974
02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:13.660
我知道规定 是我写的
I know the requirements. I wrote them.


975
02:08:18.210 --> 02:08:19.540
它召唤了他
It called to him.


976
02:08:19.710 --> 02:08:21.250
母盒
The Mother Box.


977
02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:22.790
他抢走的那个
The one he already has.


978
02:08:23.130 --> 02:08:26.170
他有两个了 他从亚特兰蒂斯抢走母盒
He has two. He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.


979
02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:28.630
现在只需要人类遗失的母盒
All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.


980
02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:29.970
他可能已经拿到手了
If he doesn't already have it.


981
02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:35.060
他没有拿到手
He doesn't have it.


982
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:39.430
在我这里
I do.


983
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:52.070
你完成征服行动了吗
Have you finished the conquest?


984
02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.490
还没有 狄萨德
Not yet, DeSaad.


985
02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:55.910
那你为何召唤我
Then why do you summon me?


986
02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.740
我带来消息
I bring news.


987
02:08:57.910 --> 02:09:00.830
强大的达克赛德登上王位之前
Before mighty Darkseid came to the throne,


988
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.500
他在全宇宙搜寻终极武器
he searched the universe for the ultimate weapon.


989
02:09:06.130 --> 02:09:08.300
反生命方程序
The Anti-Life Equation.


990
02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:13.140
掌控多重宇宙中 所有生命与自由意志的关键
The key to controlling all life and all will throughout the multiverse.


991
02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:16.310
他发现它被藏在一个原始星球上 但在他还没…
He found it hidden on a primitive planet, but before...


992
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:19.350
大家都知道你背叛了他
The story of the defiance is well-known.


993
02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.020
我找到了那个原始星球
I have found the primitive planet.


994
02:09:22.190 --> 02:09:24.230
胆敢反击的世界
The world that fought back.


995
02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.270
就是地球
It is Earth.


996
02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.650
反生命方程序被刻在…
The Anti-Life Equation is carved


997
02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:32.700
这个世界的地表
into the surface of this very world.


998
02:09:36.370 --> 02:09:37.780
你确定
Are you certain?


999
02:09:37.950 --> 02:09:38.990
我看到了
I have seen it.


1000
02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:42.580
我亲眼看到了
I have looked with my own eyes.


1001
02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:27.500
主人
My lord.


1002
02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:32.590
荒原狼
Oh, Steppenwolf.


1003
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:36.340
主人 我只是你谦卑的仆人
My lord, I am but your humble servant.


1004
02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:40.180
你真的找到它了
Can it be true that you have found it?


1005
02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:42.520
是的 霸主
I have, great one.


1006
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:46.230
失落的世界就是地球
The lost world is Earth.


1007
02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:49.400
反生命方程序就在这里
Anti-Life is here.


1008
02:10:50.730 --> 02:10:54.070
你若想寻求救赎 那就找到第三个母盒
If it is redemption you seek, find the third box,


1009
02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:57.200
合而为一形成三位一体 当这世界化为焦土
synchronize The Unity, and when this world is scorched,


1010
02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:00.580
我就会来拿我的大奖
I will come for my great prize.


1011
02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:03.750
你会来地球
You will come to Earth?


1012
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:09.040
我已经把十万个世界化为尘土
I have turned 100,000 worlds to dust


1013
02:11:09.210 --> 02:11:10.710
寻找反生命方程序
looking for Anti-Life.


1014
02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:14.090
寻找抢走我荣耀之人
Looking for those who robbed me of my glory.


1015
02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:20.010
我将踏着他们的骨骸 沐浴在反生命方程序的荣光中
I will stride across their bones and bask in the glow of Anti-Life.


1016
02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:22.890
所有的生命
And all of existence


1017
02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:26.560
都将是我的
shall be mine.


1018
02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:33.860
一定会的 主人
It shall be so, my master.


1019
02:11:38.070 --> 02:11:39.740
酷爆了
So cool.


1020
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:42.450
从外面看 这只是一栋废弃建筑物
From the outside, it looks like this building was abandoned.


1021
02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:47.960
它想要飞行
It wants to fly.


1022
02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:51.040
你和机器说话
You talk to machines?


1023
02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:53.340
我和人工智能说话
I speak to intelligence.


1024
02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:56.380
这个说她因为软体问题不能飞
This one's saying she can't fly because of a software issue,


1025
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:58.510
不过我很快就能修好
but I could fix it with a little time.


1026
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:10.480
我的数据流中有个黑点
There's a dark spot in my data stream.


1027
02:12:10.810 --> 02:12:13.070
我能感应到另外两个母盒
I could feel the other two boxes.


1028
02:12:13.230 --> 02:12:15.070
我知道它们苏醒了
I know they're awake,


1029
02:12:15.230 --> 02:12:16.740
但是看不见它们在哪里
but I can't see where they are.


1030
02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:18.900
知道敌方基地在哪里才能攻击
Well, we can't attack unless we know where the base is.


1031
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:21.320
就算我们知道
Even if we knew,


1032
02:12:21.490 --> 02:12:24.330
也没有比荒原狼更强大的生物
I've never seen a being as strong as Steppenwolf.


1033
02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:27.910
也许有一个
Maybe one.


1034
02:12:28.290 --> 02:12:29.670
超人
Hmm, Superman.


1035
02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:34.630
只要第三个母盒在沉睡 他们就看不到它 只能感应到它
As long as the third box is asleep, they can't see it, only sense it.


1036
02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.840
我们得不断移动才不会被发现
We need to keep moving so they can't catch up.


1037
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:40.180
不 这只是延缓失败的策略 不是获胜的战略
No. That's just a strategy to lose more slowly, not to win.


1038
02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:42.800
难道火焰喷射器不流行了吗
Remind me, are flamethrowers not a thing?


1039
02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:44.760
为何不直接烧毁它
Why don't we just destroy it?


1040
02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:47.020
烈火也无法摧毁母盒
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.


1041
02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:48.930
它们是一种未知的物质
They're an unknown form of matter.


1042
02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:52.560
喜欢热能 会吸收它 保存在它们的核心
Oh, they love heat. They absorb it, hold it in their cores.


1043
02:12:52.730 --> 02:12:54.860
你很了解这些盒子嘛
Well, you know a lot about these boxes.


1044
02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:56.690
非常可疑
Makes you think.


1045
02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:58.570
你在哪里找到母盒
Where'd you find the box, Victor?


1046
02:12:59.530 --> 02:13:00.950
你在怀疑我吗
Are you trying to say something?


1047
02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:02.740
我就是怀疑你
Oh, I'm saying it.


1048
02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:05.200
我们怎么知道你不是他们的奸细
How do we know you're not working for them?


1049
02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:08.750
说来话长
It's a long story.


1050
02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.120
你赶着要去哪儿吗
You got somewhere else to be?


1051
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:22.340
纳粹在二战结束前找到母盒
The Nazis found the box at the end of the Second World War,


1052
02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:25.550
它被埋在一座义大利修道院底下
buried under an Italian monastery.


1053
02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:28.100
被送去给希特勒的路上 遭到盟军拦截
The Allies intercepted it on its way to Hitler.


1054
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:30.480
1944年被带回了美国
They brought it back to the States in '44.


1055
02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:34.610
6-1-9-8-2号未知物件
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.


1056
02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:38.940
它被丢在五角大厦档案室七十年
It collected dust in the Pentagon archives for 70 years


1057
02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:42.700
直到国防部开始研究超人飞船
till DoD began to study the Superman ship.


1058
02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:47.740
星辰实验室的一位研究员 发现超人飞船和…
A researcher at STARLABS made a connection between the ship...


1059
02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:50.580
6-1-9-8-2号物件有关联
and 6-1-9-8-2.


1060
02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:54.290
他了解到它们都是外星科技
He understood they were both alien technologies.


1061
02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.540
不同的文明
Different civilizations,


1062
02:13:57.130 --> 02:13:59.250
类似的属性
similar properties.


1063
02:14:00.590 --> 02:14:03.340
虽然母盒已经沉睡了几千年
And though the box had slept for thousands of years,


1064
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:06.850
那位研究员想出 一个可以唤醒它的理论
the researcher formulated a theory on how to awaken it.


1065
02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:09.220
也真的唤醒了它
And so did.


1066
02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:12.520
后来…
Then...


1067
02:14:14.650 --> 02:14:16.560
我出了车祸 本来应该死去
I had an accident that should've killed me.


1068
02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:21.110
但是出于绝望或是疯狂
But in an act of desperation or madness,


1069
02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:23.610
那位研究员驾驭了母盒的力量
the researcher harnessed the power of the Mother Box.


1070
02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:41.880
释放了一种他无法…
He unleashed an alien technology


1071
02:14:42.050 --> 02:14:44.720
完全理解的外星科技
he didn't fully understand.


1072
02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:47.260
他利用那股力量让我活下来
He used that power to keep me alive.


1073
02:14:50.850 --> 02:14:52.430
活着…
Alive...


1074
02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:54.940
但变成了这样
but turned into this.


1075
02:14:57.730 --> 02:15:00.020
母盒继续沉睡
The box went back to sleep


1076
02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:02.610
他也没有物归原处
and he never returned it.


1077
02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:07.280
那位研究员就是塞拉斯·斯通
That researcher was Silas Stone.


1078
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:10.660
我的父亲
My father.


1079
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:15.620
等等
Wait,


1080
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:19.170
你父亲用一个母盒救了你一命
your father saved your life with one of these things?


1081
02:15:19.330 --> 02:15:21.550
它们不是变态杀人机器吗
Aren't they psycho murder machines?


1082
02:15:21.710 --> 02:15:24.090
它们是改造机器
They're change machines.


1083
02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:26.930
母盒没有救人或杀人…
The boxes don't think in terms of healing or killing,


1084
02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:29.430
活着或死亡的概念
alive or dead.


1085
02:15:29.590 --> 02:15:31.850
它们按照主人的意愿重新排列物质
They rearrange matter at the will of their masters,


1086
02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:33.600
使其再生 恢复原状
regenerate, reinstate.


1087
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:35.180
恢复原状
Reinstate?


1088
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:38.770
母盒拥有恢复粒子相互作用的力量
A box has the power to reinstate anterior particle relationships.


1089
02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:42.020
你是说任何物质的粒子 都不能被创造或毁灭
So, you mean in the way that particles of matter can't be created or destroyed,


1090
02:15:42.190 --> 02:15:44.190
它们的相互作用只会转变
their relations just transform.


1091
02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:47.110
烧掉一栋房子 粒子仍然存在
Burn down a house, the particles still exist.


1092
02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.740
房子的粒子变成灰烬的粒子
Particles of house become particles of smoke.


1093
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:53.950
任何人只要有火柴 都能把一栋房子化成灰烬
Anybody with a match can turn a house to smoke.


1094
02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.750
但是一个母盒
But a Mother Box...


1095
02:15:57.910 --> 02:16:00.130
能够把灰烬变回一栋房子
...turns smoke back into a house.


1096
02:16:06.130 --> 02:16:08.630
我知道我们都在想同样的事
I know we're all thinking the same thing right now.


1097
02:16:10.090 --> 02:16:12.600
谁要说我才不说
Who's gonna say it? I'm not gonna say it.


1098
02:16:39.870 --> 02:16:40.960
谁啊
Who is it?


1099
02:16:41.670 --> 02:16:42.880
玛莎
Martha.


1100
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:06.230
我去了星球日报 终于拿回克拉克的东西
I went to the Daily Planet to finally pick up Clark's things.


1101
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:11.030
不知道为什么 现在无处可放
I don't know why, nowhere to put them now.


1102
02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:15.450
我失去了农场
I lost the farm.


1103
02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:19.200
我迟缴房贷好一阵子了
I'd been behind on the payments for a while.


1104
02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:24.460
老实说 那房子我一个人住太大了
Truth is, the house is too big for me to live in by myself anyway.


1105
02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.800
你知道我随时都欢迎你来住
Well, you know you're welcome to stay here any time


1106
02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:29.920
只要你需要的话
for as long as you need.


1107
02:17:31.130 --> 02:17:33.760
谢谢你 露易丝 你真好心
Thank you, Lois. That's very kind.


1108
02:17:35.430 --> 02:17:37.510
但我找到一个小地方 我一个人住刚好
But I've found a little place that suits me just fine,


1109
02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:39.140
就在餐馆旁边
right by the diner.


1110
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:41.140
我不是来求助的
I'm not here for help.


1111
02:17:42.310 --> 02:17:44.190
我来是因为…
I'm here because


1112
02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:47.440
我见到派瑞先生 他跟我说…
when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that


1113
02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:51.820
克拉克死后你就没去上班了
you haven't been to work since Clark died.


1114
02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:58.240
我办不到
I can't.


1115
02:18:05.130 --> 02:18:07.460
全世界都在哀悼
The whole world is mourning.


1116
02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:11.510
为了一个象征悲伤
Grieving over a symbol.


1117
02:18:11.670 --> 02:18:15.470
我走到哪儿都看到那个"S"
Everywhere I go, everywhere I look, I see that "S."


1118
02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:18.600
也听到人们在说什么
I hear what people say.


1119
02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:20.600
好像他们都认识他
They talk like they knew him.


1120
02:18:21.810 --> 02:18:24.060
但是他们不认识克拉克
But they didn't know Clark.


1121
02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:27.940
我不能拦住他们
And I can't stop them


1122
02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:29.480
看着他们跟他们说
and look at them


1123
02:18:29.650 --> 02:18:32.400
我为我儿子感到多么骄傲
and tell them how proud I am of my son.


1124
02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:36.910
只有你知道
You're the only one who knows.


1125
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:39.490
也只有你能体会
Who feels what I do.


1126
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:43.790
悲伤加上秘密的负担
Burdened by a secret on top of grief.


1127
02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:50.250
我大老远跑来是因为我想…
I came all this way because I wanted...


1128
02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:52.420
因为我想来见你
because I wanted to see you.


1129
02:18:53.670 --> 02:18:55.630
告诉你
Tell you...


1130
02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:57.640
我能体会
I understand.


1131
02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:00.640
我…
I...


1132
02:19:01.930 --> 02:19:05.480
永远都不会像爱你儿子那样爱任何人
will never love anybody the way that I love your son.


1133
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:11.230
我也很想念他
And I just miss him.


1134
02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:14.610
我好想他啊
I miss him so much.


1135
02:19:21.330 --> 02:19:23.000
我也是 亲爱的
So do I, sweetheart.


1136
02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:32.460
玛莎 你有任何需要我都会帮忙
Martha, you know if there's anything you need, I'm here.


1137
02:19:36.050 --> 02:19:38.640
你可以帮我一个忙 亲爱的
There is something you can do for me, honey.


1138
02:19:41.050 --> 02:19:43.310
继续过活吧
Come back to the living.


1139
02:20:23.310 --> 02:20:26.140
这世界也需要你 露易丝
The world needs you, too, Lois.


1140
02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:31.100
他人都死了
The dead are dead.


1141
02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:33.190
母盒让维克多死而复生
The box brought Victor back.


1142
02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:34.900
维克多并没有死
Victor wasn't dead.


1143
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:36.820
生命不是一就是零
Life is either one or zero.


1144
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:39.910
不是生就是死 不能两者都是
It's to be or not to be. Not both.


1145
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:41.740
你能操作母盒吗 维克多
Can you operate this box, Victor?


1146
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:42.780
当然了
Of course.


1147
02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:45.620
但我们不够了解氪星生物学
But we don't know enough about Kryptonian biology.


1148
02:20:45.790 --> 02:20:47.620
谁知道会发生什么事
There's no telling what's gonna happen.


1149
02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:51.080
好吧 不过…
--Okay, but...


1150
02:20:51.250 --> 02:20:54.880
我们总得试试 对吧 我们得试试看
I mean, we have to try. Don't we? We have to try.


1151
02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:56.590
还有什么好顾忌的
What do we have to lose?


1152
02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:59.300
必须唤醒母盒才能尝试
We cannot try unless we activate the box.


1153
02:20:59.470 --> 02:21:00.930
它一旦苏醒
As soon as it wakes up...


1154
02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:03.470
敌人就会看到 然后闯进来
...the enemy sees it, comes,


1155
02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:06.180
完成三位一体 世界末日来临
activates The Unity. The end.


1156
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:08.730
我们会把整个地球…
So, what we have to lose is the entire planet


1157
02:21:08.890 --> 02:21:10.730
拱手让给想灭绝人类的外星人 这真是好消息
to a bunch of genocidal aliens. That's good to know.


1158
02:21:10.890 --> 02:21:13.520
就算超人能回来
Even if Superman could return,


1159
02:21:13.690 --> 02:21:15.570
谁敢说他就能打败他们
who's to say that he could defeat them?


1160
02:21:15.730 --> 02:21:17.610
母盒这么说
The Mother Box did.


1161
02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:21.150
维克多的父亲 一年多前启动一个母盒
Victor's father activated a Mother Box


1162
02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:23.070
当时超人还活着
more than a year ago when Superman was still alive.


1163
02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:26.660
它没召唤荒原狼 没有母盒召唤他 直到…
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf. None of the boxes did. Not until...


1164
02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:28.910
直到超人死后
Not until Superman died.


1165
02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:31.500
直到超人死后
Not until Superman died.


1166
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:34.210
-因为他们怕他 -没错
It's like they were afraid of him? Yes,


1167
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:36.590
他们怕他
they were afraid of him.


1168
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:41.300
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.


1169
02:21:42.970 --> 02:21:46.720
这团队有六个人 不是五个人 没有他就没有我们
There are six, not five. There is no us without him.


1170
02:21:56.780 --> 02:22:01.920
第五章

1171
02:21:58.310 --> 02:22:01.920
国王人马

1172
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:05.070
又完成了一项遗愿清单任务
Cross this one off the bucket list.


1173
02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:09.040
把超人从坟墓里挖出来 搞定
Exhume Superman from the grave. Check.


1174
02:22:09.450 --> 02:22:10.910
克拉克·乔瑟夫·肯特

1175
02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:13.500
你知道我们能在一奈秒内搞定 对吧
You know we could do this in a nanosecond, right?


1176
02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:15.580
没错
We could.


1177
02:22:23.130 --> 02:22:24.760
他是我的偶像
He was my hero.


1178
02:22:27.390 --> 02:22:28.600
好吧
All right.


1179
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:35.270
亚马逊人和亚特兰蒂斯人并肩作战
An Amazon working with an Atlantean.


1180
02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:36.690
半亚特兰蒂斯人
Half-Atlantean.


1181
02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:41.320
我们的族人有几千年没说过话了
How many thousands of years since our people spoke?


1182
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:44.860
不知道 我和我的族人不亲
I don't know. I'm not exactly close to mine.


1183
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:48.780
我跟亚马逊人一样讨厌亚特兰蒂斯人
I hate Atlanteans as much as you Amazons do.


1184
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:50.990
互相仇恨真的很没必要
Hate is useless.


1185
02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:55.460
是啊
Yep.


1186
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:58.340
不 谢了
No, thank you.


1187
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:05.840
我父亲告诉我亚特兰蒂斯有句老话
You know, my father told me there's a saying in Atlantis...


1188
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:09.890
"只要从黑暗中拿回什么
"None are taken back from the darkness.


1189
02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:12.680
"-就一定要… -就一定要付出代价"
"Not without...Not without giving one up in return."


1190
02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:16.520
我们也会这么说
We say the same thing.


1191
02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:20.480
真没想到
How about that?


1192
02:23:20.980 --> 02:23:22.860
神奇女侠
Wonder Woman.


1193
02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:28.200
你觉得怎样 她会不会喜欢一个小鲜肉
What do you think, man? You think she'd ever go for a younger guy?


1194
02:23:28.570 --> 02:23:31.160
她都五千岁了 巴里
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.


1195
02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:34.870
每个男人都是小鲜肉
Every guy's a younger guy.


1196
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:37.710
天啊
Jesus.


1197
02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:41.170
真是的
Oh, Christ.


1198
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:46.130
该死
-Oh, bloody...


1199
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:48.510
运气怎么样
Any luck?


1200
02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:49.760
如果你说的"运气"是指…
If by "luck" you mean


1201
02:23:49.930 --> 02:23:53.020
"今天能不能让它飞起来的运气"
"chance in hell we'll get it flying today,"


1202
02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:55.180
那就没有
then, no. No luck.


1203
02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.600
没关系
It's okay.


1204
02:23:57.770 --> 02:23:59.480
无所谓 我们只要把尸体
It doesn't matter. We're just gonna take the body


1205
02:23:59.650 --> 02:24:01.900
放进氪星飞船 它基本上是一台有机电脑
to the Kryptonian ship. It's basically an organic computer.


1206
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:04.070
可以直接和母盒讲话
It can talk directly to the Mother Box.


1207
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:06.700
什么 就像它跟莱克斯·卢瑟讲话
What? The way it talked to Lex Luthor?


1208
02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:07.900
差不多吧
Something like that.


1209
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:11.910
还会出什么差错
Huh. What could possibly go wrong?


1210
02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:20.040
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne...


1211
02:24:22.130 --> 02:24:23.340
你成功了
you did it!


1212
02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:27.010
你组成了团队 一起打这场仗
You put the team together to fight this war.


1213
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:29.510
你实现了承诺
You've fulfilled your promise.


1214
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:34.010
但是想让超人死而复生 我是说…
But to try to do that... I mean...


1215
02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:36.480
你的罪恶感超过了理性
your guilt's overcome your reason.


1216
02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:39.810
再多的国王人马都办不到
Not all the king's horses nor all the king's men...


1217
02:24:39.980 --> 02:24:43.070
阿尔弗雷德 我这次完全凭靠信念
Alfred, for once, I'm operating strictly on faith,


1218
02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:45.070
而不是理性
not on reason.


1219
02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:50.070
但如果你开始玩弄这个母盒
But if you start playing with this little box of tricks,


1220
02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:52.320
可能会是一切的终结
I mean, it could be the end of everything.


1221
02:24:52.490 --> 02:24:54.370
你怎么知道你的团队够强大
How do you know your team's strong enough?


1222
02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.960
制伏不了冲过来的公牛
If you can't bring down the charging bull,


1223
02:24:58.120 --> 02:24:59.830
就不要挥舞红色披风
then don't wave the red cape at it.


1224
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.580
是这个红色披风就可以
You do when it's this red cape.


1225
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:03.920
红色披风会冲回去
This red cape charges back.


1226
02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:19.810
好吧
Okay.


1227
02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:29.150
你是对的 斯通博士 检验报告是阴性
You were right, Dr. Stone. The tests came back negative.


1228
02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:30.950
大家都没事 包括你在内
Everyone's clear, including you.


1229
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:33.700
但为了安全起见 我们扫遍了整间实验室
Just to be on the safe side, we swept the entire facility.


1230
02:25:33.870 --> 02:25:35.620
谢谢你 汤玛斯 所以我可以走了吗
Well, thank you, Thomas. That means I'm free to go?


1231
02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:36.620
当然了
Absolutely.


1232
02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:41.920
-谢了 -大家听好
-Thanks. -Listen up, everyone.


1233
02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.540
你们都没事了 收拾你们的东西
You're all clear. So, gather your things.


1234
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:46.250
如果需要更多医疗照顾…
If you need more medical attention...


1235
02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:50.090
亚瑟 我问你 哪个比较低调 选项"A"
Arthur, yes, your opinion. Less preposterous. Option "A"?


1236
02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:51.510
-绝对不是"A" -好吧
-Definitely not "A." -Okay.


1237
02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:54.800
或是…"B"
Or... "B"?


1238
02:25:56.430 --> 02:25:57.680
我再看看选项"Ａ"
Let me see "A" again?


1239
02:26:03.310 --> 02:26:06.440
好了 该换装了
Right. We should get dressed.


1240
02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:10.530
我一直都穿着
I'm always dressed.


1241
02:26:37.850 --> 02:26:38.680
识别证
ID?


1242
02:26:38.930 --> 02:26:40.100
识别证
ID.


1243
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:44.390
遵命
Aye, aye.


1244
02:26:46.730 --> 02:26:47.940
"遵命"
"Aye, aye"?


1245

星辰实验室人事档案

1246
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:05.620
卫斯理·罗伊
宪兵 允许通行


1247
02:27:11.170 --> 02:27:12.510
可以了
Okay.


1248
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:14.760
"可以" 可以了
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!


1249
02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:22.810
博士
Doc!


1250
02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:24.180
他们放你出来了
They let you out of quarantine.


1251
02:27:24.350 --> 02:27:25.640
是啊 他们终于肯听我讲道理
Yeah, I finally got them to listen to reason.


1252
02:27:25.810 --> 02:27:28.060
现在让我们看看电子激光
Now, let's take a look and see what progress we've made


1253
02:27:28.230 --> 02:27:29.230
有什么进展
with the electron-laser.


1254
02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:31.730
我们有了真正的进展 让我给你看
We've made some real progress. Let me show you.


1255
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:49.330
维克多 清空这地方
Victor, clear this place out.


1256
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:50.920
没问题
Done.


1257
02:27:55.130 --> 02:27:57.260
红色警戒 受到污染
Code Red. Contamination breach.


1258
02:27:56.660 --> 02:27:58.590
生化威胁

1259
02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:01.220
全体人员立刻疏散
All personnel evacuate immediately.


1260
02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:03.430
生化威胁红色警戒
Bio red five.


1261
02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:05.980
感应器侦测到外星微生物
The sensor's picking up a microbe of alien origin.


1262
02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:08.770
外星微生物不可能
A microbe of alien origin? That doesn't make any sense.


1263
02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:09.940
一定是虚惊一场
It's gotta be a false alarm.


1264
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:12.480
各位 关闭实验室 尽快离开
All right, people, shut it down. Let's go.


1265
02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:13.690
-刚刚才扫过一遍 -走吧
-Ryan, we just had it swept. -We have to go, Doc.


1266
02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:16.030
-一定有人误触警报 -走吧 博士
Think about it. It's gotta be a false alarm. -Let's go, Doc.


1267
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:17.780
-想想看 -全员撤离
-Think about it. Full base evacuation! Everyone out!


1268
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:20.200
听好 等等 该死
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!


1269
02:28:20.370 --> 02:28:23.120
保持冷静 前往最近出口
Remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit.


1270
02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:31.290
注意 全体人员
Attention, all personnel.


1271
02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:34.250
快点 大家都出去 快点
Go! Go! Everybody out! Come on! Move!


1272
02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:36.050
快走 快啊
Move! Come on! Go, go!


1273
02:28:36.210 --> 02:28:37.720
大家都出去 快点
Everybody out! Go!


1274
02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:58.080
生化威胁

1275
02:28:58.080 --> 02:28:58.650
安全

1276
02:28:58.740 --> 02:28:59.740
搞定
Yes!


1277
02:28:59.910 --> 02:29:00.740
搞定了
Gotcha!


1278
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:03.780
这是塞拉斯·斯通博士 收到吗
Post Commander, this is Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?


1279
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:06.410
-请说 -这是假警报
-Go ahead, Dr. Stone. -This is a false alarm.


1280
02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:09.750
有人骇入系统 我们得…
Someone has hacked into the system. We must alert...


1281
02:29:19.090 --> 02:29:20.510
维克多
Victor.


1282
02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:24.430
斯通博士 你在吗 我没收到
Dr. Stone, you there? I don't copy.


1283
02:29:25.470 --> 02:29:26.470
我搞错了
I was mistaken.


1284
02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:27.850
警报是真的
The alarm's legit.


1285
02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:29.600
大家都出去 任何人 我重复
Everybody out. And nobody, I repeat,


1286
02:29:29.770 --> 02:29:32.520
没有我的允许 任何人都不准回来
nobody comes back inside without my say-so.


1287
02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:33.940
收到了
Roger that, sir.


1288
02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:45.620
大家都出来
Get the civilians out!


1289
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:46.950
快点 快点
Let's go! Let's go!


1290
02:29:51.370 --> 02:29:52.750
-大家都安全出来了 -应该吧
-Everybody got out okay? -I think so.


1291
02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:53.750
-每一个人 -对
-Everybody? -Yes.


1292
02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:28.330
这里
This way.


1293
02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:40.880
它知道他来了
It knows he's here.


1294
02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:44.050
超紧张的
Ooh, that's intense.


1295
02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:50.390
太惊人了
This is amazing.


1296
02:30:51.220 --> 02:30:52.430
太疯狂了
This is crazy.


1297
02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:54.480
什么 现在才说疯狂
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?


1298
02:30:54.650 --> 02:30:57.020
你们这群疯子最好知道自己在干嘛
You two lunatics better know what you're doing.


1299
02:32:04.380 --> 02:32:08.390
露易丝·莱恩
星球日报记者


1300
02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:16.180
验孕棒

1301
02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.840
系统即将上线
Systems coming online.


1302
02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:32.010
欢迎 维克多 您想接手掌控吗
Welcome, Victor. Would you like to assume command?


1303
02:33:32.180 --> 02:33:33.010
我进去了
I'm in.


1304
02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:44.650
这艘飞船说母盒有敌意
The ship says the Mother Box is hostile.


1305
02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:46.480
我可以取消安全协定
I can override the security protocols,


1306
02:33:46.650 --> 02:33:48.280
但是没时间修复卢瑟对主电容器
but there's no time to repair all the electrical damage


1307
02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:50.740
造成的所有的电力损害
that Luthor's power surges caused to the primary capacitors.


1308
02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:52.070
说白话
English.


1309
02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:54.280
电流不够 无法唤醒母盒
There's not enough charge to wake the box.


1310
02:33:55.240 --> 02:33:56.660
我可能有办法
I might be able to do it.


1311
02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:00.910
我也许可以启动它
I mean, I might be able to jump-start it.


1312
02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:02.120
我不喜欢打破这规则
I don't like to break this rule,


1313
02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:04.210
但是当我接近光速 我…
but when I approach the speed of light, I...


1314
02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:05.880
听着 时间会发生疯狂的事
Look, crazy things happen to time,


1315
02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:08.630
但要是我成功了 就能制造巨大的电力
but if I do it, I create massive electrical power.


1316
02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:10.550
我可以往回跑 只要距离够远
I could backtrack, if I can get enough distance,


1317
02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:12.880
就能传导大量电流
I can conduct a significant electrical current.


1318
02:34:13.050 --> 02:34:15.390
也许可以唤醒母盒 如果…
I might be able to wake the box, if that's...


1319
02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:17.390
还是要这么做的话
still what we want?


1320
02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:18.970
没错 开始吧
It is. Do it.


1321
02:34:23.810 --> 02:34:25.020
你好 莱恩小姐
Hey, Miss Lane.


1322
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:26.020
早安
Morning.


1323
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:27.440
我以为你不会来了
I didn't think you were coming.


1324
02:34:28.730 --> 02:34:30.070
最后一次
One last time.


1325
02:34:32.610 --> 02:34:34.200
封锁线 请勿跨越

1326
02:34:47.210 --> 02:34:50.590
我看到发动机 这一定是终点线
I see engines, so this must be the end of the line. So I'm...


1327
02:34:51.090 --> 02:34:52.170
我就位了
I'm in position.


1328
02:34:55.050 --> 02:34:57.140
准备开始投放程序
Ready to initiate drop sequence.


1329
02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:59.220
母盒准备好了
The Mother Box is ready.


1330
02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:20.580
这艘飞船在求我不要唤醒母盒
The ship's begging me not to wake the box.


1331
02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:22.540
-这是无法逆转的程序 -它很害怕
This action is irreversible. It's afraid.


1332
02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:23.790
它知道荒原狼会来找它
It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.


1333
02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:25.710
我们知道了 继续吧
We know that already. Continue.


1334
02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:28.500
我强烈建议不要启动
I strongly advise against activation.


1335
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:30.210
巴里 我要开始倒数了
Barry, I'm initiating the countdown.


1336
02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:32.090
这是无法逆转的程序
This action is irreversible.


1337
02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:33.300
-五 -五
-Five... -Five...


1338
02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:34.220
五
-Five...


1339
02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:35.510
-天启星有敌意 -馊主意
-Apokoliptian technology is hostile. -This is a bad idea.


1340
02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:36.640
并不是 继续吧
No, it isn't. Keep going.


1341
02:35:36.930 --> 02:35:37.760
四
Four...


1342
02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:39.100
-四 -四
-Four... -Four...


1343
02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:40.970
-我强烈建议不要启动 -我们得立刻中止
I strongly advise against activation. -We need to abort, now.


1344
02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:42.100
快动手
-Just do it.


1345
02:35:42.430 --> 02:35:43.430
-三 -三

1348
02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:48.520
-二 -这是无法逆转的程序
-Two... -This course is irreversible.


1349
02:35:48.810 --> 02:35:49.770
-一 -一
-One. -One.


1350
02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:53.610
-一 -这是无法逆转的程序
One. This action is irreversible.


1351
02:37:14.030 --> 02:37:17.990
正义联盟

1352
02:37:22.530 --> 02:37:24.120
-维克多 -不
-Victor? -No.


1353
02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:25.990
上
Go?


1354
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:59.760
未来已经在现在扎根
The future has taken root in the present.


1355
02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:01.340
快趴下
-Get down!


1356
02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:22.460
你若在寻找他的纪念碑 看看你周围

1357
02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:46.990
他活过来了
He's back.


1358
02:41:14.010 --> 02:41:16.730
不太对劲 他在扫描我们
Something's wrong. He's scanning us.


1359
02:41:18.850 --> 02:41:20.270
什么
What?


1360
02:41:35.450 --> 02:41:36.290
维克多
Victor?


1361
02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:38.580
维克多
Victor?


1362
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:42.420
-该死 -你在干嘛
-Shit. -What are you doing?


1363
02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:44.420
是我的自动防御系统
It's my auto-defense system.


1364
02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:45.630
它感应到危险
It senses danger.


1365
02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:46.960
维克多 住手
Victor, no! Victor!


1366
02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:48.970
-我无法控制 -住手
-I can't control it. -Don't!


1367
02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:02.560
卡尔·艾尔 不要
Kal-El, no!


1368
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:12.910
他头脑不清楚 不知道自己是谁
He's confused. He doesn't know who he is.


1369
02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:22.710
亚瑟 我们得制伏他
Arthur, we need to restrain him.


1370
02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:56.910
卡尔·艾尔 最后的氪星之子
Kal-El, the last Son of Krypton...


1371
02:42:57.990 --> 02:43:00.200
回想你是谁
remember who you are.


1372
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:03.250
告诉我你是谁
Tell me who you...


1373
02:44:38.050 --> 02:44:38.890
快逃
Let's go!


1374
02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:49.940
你最好闪边
You should probably move.


1375
02:44:53.230 --> 02:44:54.230
-没事吗 -没事
-You all right? -Yeah.


1376
02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:56.860
起来 去找掩护 快去
Get up. Take cover back there. Go.


1377
02:45:49.290 --> 02:45:51.330
别逼我这么做
Please don't make me do this.


1378
02:46:24.030 --> 02:46:25.160
克拉克
Clark.


1379
02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:27.410
克拉克 不
Clark, no.


1380
02:46:39.010 --> 02:46:39.970
克拉克

No.


1382
02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:44.140
这世界需要你
This world needs you.


1383
02:46:49.430 --> 02:46:50.350
克拉克
Clark.

02:46:50.730 --> 02:46:51.980
克拉克
Clark.


1385
02:46:52.310 --> 02:46:54.100
别开枪
Whoa! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!


1386
02:46:55.690 --> 02:46:56.820
克拉克
Clark.


1387
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:01.570
求求你
Please.


1388
02:47:35.810 --> 02:47:36.940
求求你
Please.


1389
02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:49.330
求求你
Please.


1390
02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:51.870
走吧
Just go.


1391
02:47:52.330 --> 02:47:53.330
没错
Yeah.


1392
02:47:54.210 --> 02:47:55.500
我们走吧
Let's go.


1393
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:30.410
真是拍谢
I'm so sorry.


1394
02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:40.540
找掩护
Take cover!


1395
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:43.210
-他来了 -母盒
-He's coming. -The Mother Box.


1396
02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:44.420
它在哪里
Where is it?


1397
02:48:55.140 --> 02:48:56.350
快点
Come on.


1398
02:48:57.270 --> 02:48:58.560
快点
Come on.


1399
02:49:24.090 --> 02:49:27.130
注意 实验室受到入侵
Attention, security breach detected.


1400
02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:29.890
第四区 第三层
Sector Four, Level Three.


1401
02:49:30.050 --> 02:49:32.850
立刻执行封锁程序
Implement lockdown procedures immediately.


1402
02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:03.000
把母盒给我
Give me the Mother Box.


1403
02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:17.600
不 不
No, no, no.


1404
02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:21.850
爸 等等 不要
Dad, wait! Don't!


1405
02:51:02.190 --> 02:51:05.060
末日即将开始
So begins the end.


1406
02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:12.110
维克多
Victor?


1407
02:51:14.660 --> 02:51:17.780
维克多 你没事吧 站起来
Vic... Whoa, Victor. Are you okay, man? Come on.


1408
02:51:23.790 --> 02:51:24.960
维克多
Victor?


1409
02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:27.540
他死了
He's dead.


1410
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:28.710
什么
What?


1411
02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:31.010
我父亲
My father.


1412
02:51:32.470 --> 02:51:35.430
我没能救他 我没办法
I didn't save him. I couldn't.


1413
02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:37.510
天啊
Oh, my God.


1414
02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:46.520
他父亲是因我们而死
His father's dead 'cause of us.


1415
02:51:46.690 --> 02:51:48.150
我就说唤醒母盒是个馊主意
I told you waking that box was a bad idea.


1416
02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:49.900
这不是个馊主意
It wasn't a bad idea.


1417
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:52.400
我们需要超人 现在仍然需要
We needed Superman. We still do.


1418
02:51:52.570 --> 02:51:54.860
不管是什么回来了 那不是超人
Well, whatever returned, it isn't Superman.


1419
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:58.030
也许是他的躯体和超能力 但那不是他
His body and powers, maybe. But it ain't him.


1420
02:51:58.200 --> 02:51:59.830
那是他
It is him.


1421
02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:02.120
他认得露易丝·莱恩
He recognized Lois Lane.


1422
02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:04.410
-谁 -他挚爱的女人
-Who? -The woman he loves.


1423
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:06.790
-他记得她 -才怪
-He remembers her. -Nah.


1424
02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:09.090
他会去找她是因为她不怕他
He went to her 'cause she wasn't afraid of him.


1425
02:52:09.250 --> 02:52:10.670
这叫做直觉 戴安娜
It's called instinct, Diana.


1426
02:52:18.100 --> 02:52:19.930
等等 荒原狼去了哪儿
Wait, where did Steppenwolf go?


1427
02:52:20.100 --> 02:52:23.430
他回去基地组装三个母盒
He's gone back to his base to assemble the three boxes.


1428
02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:25.690
我们不知道他的基地在哪里 或是还要多久…
And we don't know where his base is. -Or how long until...


1429
02:52:25.850 --> 02:52:26.690
几个小时
-Hours.


1430
02:52:26.850 --> 02:52:28.520
盒子一旦同步 形成三位一体
The boxes synchronize, Unity forms,


1431
02:52:28.690 --> 02:52:30.940
我们不能及时阻止他 地球就完了
we don't get there in time to stop it, the planet dies.


1432
02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:33.530
这不像你
This is not your...


1433
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:37.570
他早就知道
He knew.


1434
02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:39.450
他早就知道了
He knew, he knew, he knew.


1435
02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:41.030
他不是想要摧毁那个母盒
He wasn't trying to destroy the box...


1436
02:52:41.450 --> 02:52:43.370
而是想要让它过热
he was trying to superheat it.


1437
02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:46.210
让核心变成核反应炉以外 地球上最热的东西
He made the core the hottest thing on Earth outside of a nuclear reactor.


1438
02:52:46.370 --> 02:52:48.420
-那么热的东西一定会… -热源影像系统
Now, anything that hot would have to...Blink off the charts


1439
02:52:48.580 --> 02:52:50.790
一定会破表
on a thermal imaging system.


1440
02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:54.340
你父亲为了标记母盒牺牲自己
Your father sacrificed himself to mark that box.


1441
02:52:54.510 --> 02:52:56.380
我们得回我的实验室使用卫星
We have to get back to my lab and use the satellite


1442
02:52:56.550 --> 02:52:58.550
扫描地球哪里有热异常
to scan the Earth for thermal anomalies.


1443
02:52:58.720 --> 02:52:59.850
我已经在扫描了
I'm already on it.


1444
02:53:00.010 --> 02:53:02.010
什么 你有一颗卫星
I'm sorry. You have a satellite?


1445
02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:03.140
我有六颗
I have six.


1446
02:53:03.810 --> 02:53:04.730
是喔
Right.


1447
02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:08.520
咱们去找那个混帐东西
Let's go find the son of a bitch.


1448
02:53:14.320 --> 02:53:19.610
第六章

1449
02:53:16.060 --> 02:53:19.610
“更黑暗的东西”

1450
02:53:29.410 --> 02:53:32.920
法拍屋出售

1451
02:53:33.090 --> 02:53:35.170
你把我带来这里
You brought us here.


1452
02:53:35.340 --> 02:53:36.510
你记得
You remembered.


1453
02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:39.050
这是我的家
This is home.


1454
02:53:40.970 --> 02:53:42.180
你说话了
You spoke.


1455
02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:48.100
我之前没有吗
Did I not before?


1456
02:54:22.090 --> 02:54:24.640
你母亲迟缴了房贷
Your mother got behind on the payments.


1457
02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:28.140
没有告诉任何人
She never told anyone.


1458
02:54:29.810 --> 02:54:31.560
我不明白
I don't understand.


1459
02:54:34.650 --> 02:54:37.070
她的自尊心很强 克拉克
She's a proud woman, Clark.


1460
02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:41.570
穿上去
Here.


1461
02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:58.170
她很喜欢这里
She loved it here.


1462
02:55:08.970 --> 02:55:10.600
我也是
So did I.


1463
02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:14.020
我也是
So did I.


1464
02:55:41.130 --> 02:55:42.760
这太酷了
This is awesome.


1465
02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:44.430
我带了一些朋友来
Brought some friends.


1466
02:55:50.970 --> 02:55:53.560
天啊 太棒了
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!


1467
02:55:53.730 --> 02:55:56.230
大伙儿 这是阿尔弗雷德 我替他工作
Everyone, this is Alfred. I work for him.


1468
02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:58.610
-阿尔弗雷德 -你好 女士
-Alfred. -Good day, ma'am.


1469
02:56:05.070 --> 02:56:06.950
这里真的很酷 阿尔弗雷德
It's badass, Alfred.


1470
02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:12.160
我去泡茶
Well, I'll put on the tea.


1471
02:56:12.330 --> 02:56:13.330
太好了
Great.


1472
02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:15.330
不知道哪里有这么多杯子
I don't know where we're gonna find the cups.


1473
02:56:18.250 --> 02:56:21.090
那就是母盒 就在那里
There's the Mother Box, right there.


1474
02:56:21.250 --> 02:56:23.050
显示可见光谱
Go to visible spectrum.


1475
02:56:25.930 --> 02:56:26.760
普扎诺夫
Pozharnov.


1476
02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:30.180
离莫斯科不远的鬼城
Ghost city not far from Moscow.


1477
02:56:30.350 --> 02:56:33.020
三十年前发生核事故后被废弃
It's been abandoned since the nuclear accident there 30 years ago.


1478
02:56:33.180 --> 02:56:34.390
就连军队也不进去
Not even the army goes in.


1479
02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:35.850
是啊 辐射性一定强到
Right, it's probably so radioactive


1480
02:56:36.020 --> 02:56:38.190
你的脖子会长出另一只脚
that you grow an extra foot outta your neck.


1481
02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:39.190
不再是这样了
Not anymore.


1482
02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:41.530
他收集了辐射 用来创建他的基地
He's harvested the radiation to build his base.


1483
02:56:41.690 --> 02:56:42.530
放大
Zoom.


1484
02:56:46.530 --> 02:56:47.910
他到底在盖什么
What the hell is he building?


1485
02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:49.320
三位一体在里面
The Unity's in there.


1486
02:56:49.490 --> 02:56:50.910
我们要从上面进攻
We'll attack from above.


1487
02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:53.660
炸药无法分开母盒
Explosives won't separate the boxes,


1488
02:56:53.830 --> 02:56:55.660
只会强化它们的联系
only strengthen their bond.


1489
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:56.960
什么 我们不能炸掉它
What? So we can't blow it up?


1490
02:56:57.120 --> 02:56:58.580
不能从外面
Not from the outside.


1491
02:57:00.170 --> 02:57:02.550
我想插入合而为一的母盒
I want to plug into The Unity, one-on-one.


1492
02:57:03.260 --> 02:57:04.670
和它融为一体
Fuse with it.


1493
02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:07.380
从内部削弱它的连结 就能够再把它拆成三个
Weaken its bond from the inside so we can break it back into three.


1494
02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:09.760
不行 你不知道你会面对什么
No, you don't know what you'd be up against.


1495
02:57:09.930 --> 02:57:13.470
你得一个人融入三位一体
You'd have to stream into The Unity by yourself.


1496
02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:15.980
这三个母盒结合起来足以毁天灭地
These boxes together are world destroyers.


1497
02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:17.560
它们存在了十亿年
A billion years old.


1498
02:57:17.730 --> 02:57:19.860
绝对会钻进你脑袋 找到你的弱点
They'll get inside you and find your weaknesses


1499
02:57:20.020 --> 02:57:22.190
和你的恐惧 并用来摧毁你
and your fears, and use them to destroy you.


1500
02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:24.360
只要让我进去 替我争取时间
Just get me in and get me time.


1501
02:57:24.610 --> 02:57:25.780
你可能会死 维克多
You could die, Victor.


1502
02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:28.240
我不这样做 我们都会死
If I don't, we all die. Period.


1503
02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:34.750
我失去了一切
I got nothing left.


1504
02:57:40.130 --> 02:57:42.090
你不是要我使用这些超能力吗
You wanted me to use these gifts, right?


1505
02:57:45.170 --> 02:57:46.670
我就要这么做
That's what I'm gonna do.


1506
02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:48.720
好吧 所以…
Okay. So...


1507
02:57:49.430 --> 02:57:52.680
维克多想和末日母盒 合而为一拯救世界
if Victor wants to try to save the world by fusing with the doom boxes,


1508
02:57:52.890 --> 02:57:55.060
那就让他这么做吧
I say we put him in the doom boxes.


1509
02:57:55.390 --> 02:57:58.190
但要让他这么做就得攻击基地
But getting him in means attacking that base.


1510
02:57:58.350 --> 02:58:00.560
深入地狱向魔鬼与他的军团…
Fighting the devil and his army


1511
02:58:00.730 --> 02:58:01.770
正式开战
in hell.


1512
02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:04.190
这家伙在他摧毁的星球上
I mean, this guy's probably fought


1513
02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:08.320
大概打过成千上万个超级英雄 对吧
hundreds of thousands of other superbeings on the other planets he's destroyed, right?


1514
02:58:08.490 --> 02:58:09.990
我们得假设他都赢了
And we have to assume he's won.


1515
02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:13.280
我才不管他在多少个地狱 打过多少恶魔
I don't care how many demons he's fought in how many hells...


1516
02:58:13.450 --> 02:58:16.950
他没打过我们 团结一致的我们
he's never fought us. Not us united.


1517
02:59:07.420 --> 02:59:09.050
我猜你说"愿意"
Take that as a "yes."


1518
02:59:09.670 --> 02:59:10.510
什么
What?


1519
02:59:13.970 --> 02:59:15.220
那只婚戒
The ring.


1520
02:59:18.930 --> 02:59:20.480
你真的回来了
You're really back.


1521
02:59:53.970 --> 02:59:56.180
我得到第二次机会
I have a second chance, Lo.


1522
02:59:58.470 --> 03:00:00.930
绝对不会白白浪费
And I am not gonna waste it.


1523
03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:00.370
真的是你吗
Are you really you?


1524
03:01:00.530 --> 03:01:02.240
真的是我 妈
I'm really me, Ma.


1525
03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:22.310
听好 妈
Listen, Ma.


1526
03:01:23.890 --> 03:01:25.930
他们让我回来一定有原因
They wanted me back for a reason.


1527
03:01:27.690 --> 03:01:29.230
我得知道为什么
I need to find out why.


1528
03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:50.790
维克多怎么样
How's Victor doing?


1529
03:01:55.170 --> 03:01:57.920
你也知道 他想独处一下
You know, wanted to be by himself.


1530
03:01:59.510 --> 03:02:02.680
我们要求一个刚失去父亲的孩子…
We're asking a kid who just lost his father


1531
03:02:02.850 --> 03:02:05.640
对抗全宇宙最强大的机器
to go up against the most powerful machines in the universe.


1532
03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:08.980
这不公平
It's not fair.


1533
03:02:10.730 --> 03:02:12.360
我以为你不在乎
I thought you didn't care?


1534
03:02:13.770 --> 03:02:15.280
我从来没这么说过
I never said that.


1535
03:02:28.210 --> 03:02:29.620
怎么了
What is it?


1536
03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:38.550
我做过一个梦 不晓得 几乎就像一种预感
I had a dream, like, I don't know, almost like a premonition.


1537
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:42.300
那是世界末日
It was the end of the world


1538
03:02:42.470 --> 03:02:45.310
巴里·艾伦就在这里
and Barry Allen was right here


1539
03:02:45.470 --> 03:02:49.350
他跟我说 "露易丝·莱恩才是关键"
and he said to me, "Lois Lane is the key."


1540
03:02:52.020 --> 03:02:55.230
对超人来说…她是
She is... to Superman.


1541
03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:57.900
每个人都有心爱的人
Every heart has one.


1542
03:02:58.530 --> 03:03:00.400
我想不只是这样
I think it's something more.


1543
03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:03.160
这是更黑暗的东西
Something darker.


1544
03:03:07.330 --> 03:03:08.330
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne.


1545
03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:10.000
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne!


1546
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:12.500
你得来看看
You need to see this.


1547
03:03:35.770 --> 03:03:37.480
你修好了
You fixed it.


1548
03:03:37.650 --> 03:03:39.360
它想要飞行
It wanted to fly.


1549
03:03:40.610 --> 03:03:41.950
飞行是它的本能
Flight is its nature.


1550
03:03:42.110 --> 03:03:43.410
也是你的
Yours, too.


1551
03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:52.160
他会来的 阿尔弗雷德 我知道
He'll be here, Alfred, I know it.


1552
03:03:52.330 --> 03:03:53.960
你为何这么肯定
What makes you so sure?


1553
03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:57.290
信念 阿尔弗雷德 信念
Faith, Alfred. Faith.


1554
03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:20.980
终于
At last.


1555
03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:25.530
准备迎接他的到来
Prepare for his arrival.


1556
03:04:27.370 --> 03:04:31.500
我即将得到救赎
My redemption is nigh.


1557
03:04:39.380 --> 03:04:40.840
合而为一
Unite.


1558
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:48.510
同步化
Synchronize.


1559
03:05:32.850 --> 03:05:35.770
卫星显示他打造了一个防御圆顶
The satellites revealed he's created a defensive dome.


1560
03:05:35.930 --> 03:05:37.100
这是个设计缺陷
It's a design flaw.


1561
03:05:37.270 --> 03:05:39.520
把塔台射倒 圆顶就会崩垮
Take out the tower, the dome will fall.


1562
03:05:39.690 --> 03:05:41.690
敌人不会料到我们正面攻击
The enemy never anticipated a frontal assault.


1563
03:05:41.860 --> 03:05:45.360
是啊 因为他没想到 有人会这么疯狂
Right, probably 'cause he didn't think anyone would be that nuts.


1564
03:05:46.360 --> 03:05:47.650
布鲁斯是对的
Bruce is right.


1565
03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:49.410
我们必须摧毁防御圆顶
We've got to destroy the defensive dome


1566
03:05:49.570 --> 03:05:51.870
在它们同步化之前找到母盒
so we can reach The Unity before it synchronizes.


1567
03:05:52.030 --> 03:05:53.740
要是圆顶没被摧毁呢
What if the dome's not destroyed?


1568
03:05:53.910 --> 03:05:54.910
它一定会被摧毁
It'll be destroyed.


1569
03:05:55.080 --> 03:05:56.710
维克多一旦融入三位一体
Once Victor is linked with The Unity


1570
03:05:57.210 --> 03:06:00.460
有巴里的协助 他就能突破母盒的防御
with Barry's help, he'll break through The Unity's defenses.


1571
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:02.090
提醒我 我该怎么做
Remind me, how's that again?


1572
03:06:02.250 --> 03:06:03.880
用爱的力量
Uh, with the power of love.


1573
03:06:04.050 --> 03:06:06.670
-巴里 -我得造成能量大爆发
-Barry. -With a catastrophic energy surge.


1574
03:06:06.840 --> 03:06:07.840
很好
Good.


1575
03:06:08.010 --> 03:06:09.890
你得比以前跑得更快
You'll have to run faster than you've ever attempted


1576
03:06:10.050 --> 03:06:12.600
才能产生这么大的电流
to generate a charge of that size.


1577
03:06:12.760 --> 03:06:14.770
然后直接碰触维克多的身体
And then you make physical contact with Victor.


1578
03:06:15.100 --> 03:06:17.980
那股能量应该能让他进入母盒
That force should propel him inside The Unity.


1579
03:06:18.140 --> 03:06:20.020
维克多 之后就靠你了
And, Victor, it's all up to you.


1580
03:06:20.190 --> 03:06:22.940
在它同步化之前把它扯开
Take it apart from the inside before it synchronizes.


1581
03:06:24.520 --> 03:06:26.650
我们终于有了计划
Whew. We actually finally have a plan.


1582
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:28.900
我们有了计划
We have a plan.


1583
03:06:44.250 --> 03:06:46.300
艾尔之家的标记代表希望
The symbol of the house of El means hope.


1584
03:06:46.460 --> 03:06:48.630
这希望包含了一个基本的信念
Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief


1585
03:06:48.800 --> 03:06:52.510
那就是每个人都有行善的潜力
in the potential of every person to be a force for good.


1586
03:06:52.680 --> 03:06:53.510
克拉克
Clark...


1587
03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:54.970
那就是你能带给他们的
That's what you can bring them.


1588
03:06:55.140 --> 03:06:57.100
你被送来这里是有原因的
...you were sent here for a reason.


1589
03:06:57.270 --> 03:07:01.140
你将给地球的人类 一个努力达到的理想
You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards.


1590
03:07:01.810 --> 03:07:03.650
就算你必须穷尽一生
And even if it takes you the rest of your life,


1591
03:07:03.810 --> 03:07:07.570
也得尽全力找到你来这里的原因
you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is.


1592
03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:10.360
他们会犯错 也会失败
They will stumble, they will fall.


1593
03:07:10.530 --> 03:07:11.860
但你必须做出选择
You're gonna have to make a choice.


1594
03:07:12.660 --> 03:07:15.080
他们将与你一起迎向阳光
They will join you in the sun, Kal.


1595
03:07:15.240 --> 03:07:19.200
你必须选择是否要 骄傲地站在全人类面前
A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not.


1596
03:07:19.370 --> 03:07:22.540
你将帮助他们完成奇迹
You will help them accomplish wonders.


1597
03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:44.190
氪星所有的希望和梦想 都寄托在你身上
All the hopes and dreams of Krypton live in you now.


1598
03:07:44.350 --> 03:07:46.610
我真为你感到骄傲 儿子
I'm so proud of you, son.


1599
03:07:47.940 --> 03:07:49.990
你母亲和我都很爱你
Your mother and I loved you.


1600
03:07:50.650 --> 03:07:54.200
你母亲和我都知道你会改变世界
Your mother and I knew you would change the world.


1601
03:07:55.490 --> 03:07:57.330
你的心受到考验
Your heart was tested.


1602
03:07:58.620 --> 03:08:00.580
我知道这很难 克拉克
I know it's been hard, Clark.


1603
03:08:01.330 --> 03:08:04.250
但你给了他们的世界一个希望
But you gave hope to their world.


1604
03:08:04.420 --> 03:08:07.090
你必须让他们看到你是谁
You need to show them who you are.


1605
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:09.500
爱他们吧 卡尔·艾尔
Love them, Kal.


1606
03:08:10.130 --> 03:08:12.260
就像我们爱你一样
The way we loved you.


1607
03:08:14.720 --> 03:08:15.840
飞吧 儿子
Fly, son.


1608
03:08:16.890 --> 03:08:18.100
是时候了
It's time.


1609
03:09:21.870 --> 03:09:25.000
我要把塔台射倒 破坏力场圆顶
I'm gonna take out that tower and knock down that shield dome.


1610
03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:26.290
不管你们看到什么
Whatever you see,


1611
03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:29.580
都要按照计划
stick to the plan.


1612
03:09:31.460 --> 03:09:33.380
这就是我把你们聚在一起的原因
It's why I brought you together.


1613
03:10:13.460 --> 03:10:15.210
布鲁斯 撤退 你不会成功的
Bruce, pull back. You're not gonna make it.


1614
03:10:19.010 --> 03:10:21.050
只要敲大声一点
Just have to knock a little louder.


1615
03:10:46.040 --> 03:10:47.620
杀了他
Kill him!


1616
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:50.540
快去捍卫三位一体
Get to the carriage. Defend The Unity.


1617
03:10:55.840 --> 03:10:56.760
惨了
Oh, shit.


1618
03:11:17.070 --> 03:11:17.990
塔台倒了
The tower's down.


1619
03:11:19.610 --> 03:11:21.030
收到吗
Do you read me?


1620
03:11:21.660 --> 03:11:22.780
收到了
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.


1621
03:11:23.870 --> 03:11:25.240
你没事吗
Are you okay?


1622
03:11:26.490 --> 03:11:29.080
布鲁斯
Bruce? Bruce?


1623
03:11:29.370 --> 03:11:30.250
快去反应炉
Get to the reactor.


1624
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:32.920
我会尽量把这些怪物引开来
I'll lure as many of these monsters away from you as I can.


1625
03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:33.920
那是什么意思
-What does that mean?


1626
03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:38.920
别担心我 快去找到母盒
Don't worry about me. Get to The Unity.


1627
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:42.760
它们来了
They're here.


1628
03:11:43.140 --> 03:11:44.050
布鲁斯
Bruce?


1629
03:11:46.970 --> 03:11:48.270
失去讯号
Comm went dead.


1630
03:11:49.980 --> 03:11:51.230
上吧
Let's go.


1631
03:12:30.140 --> 03:12:31.980
跟我来呀 你们这群臭虫
Come on, follow me, you damn insects.


1632
03:13:51.930 --> 03:13:53.100
严重受损
Critical damage.


1633
03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:34.350
你真的发疯了
You really are outta your mind.


1634
03:15:01.250 --> 03:15:02.380
不客气
You're welcome.


1635
03:15:02.540 --> 03:15:03.840
厉害 兄弟
My man.


1636
03:16:36.930 --> 03:16:38.560
放心 我们能搞定
Yeah, we got this.


1637
03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:40.100
你去做该做的事
You go do your thing.


1638
03:17:35.900 --> 03:17:37.410
我猜你就是阿尔弗雷德
I'm assuming you're Alfred.


1639
03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:40.580
肯特少爷
Master Kent.


1640
03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:44.120
他说你会来
He said you'd come.


1641
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:49.250
希望你没有来得太晚
Now, let's hope you're not too late.


1642
03:18:00.100 --> 03:18:01.180
喂
-Hey!


1643
03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:11.820
记得我吗
Remember me?


1644
03:18:14.360 --> 03:18:15.780
第二回合
Round two?


1645
03:18:16.490 --> 03:18:17.650
好啊
Hell yeah.


1646
03:18:39.180 --> 03:18:40.550
上吧
Shall we?


1647
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:43.810
告诉我 亚马逊女战士
Tell me, Amazon,


1648
03:18:43.970 --> 03:18:47.270
你为何抛弃自己的姐妹
why did you abandon your own sisters


1649
03:18:48.190 --> 03:18:50.600
跑来跟这些卑微的生物
only to cast your lot with these creatures


1650
03:18:50.770 --> 03:18:54.070
混在一起
clinging to their puny lives?


1651
03:18:54.270 --> 03:18:57.110
你没能赶去保护她们被我屠杀
You weren't there to protect them from me.


1652
03:18:57.360 --> 03:18:59.570
可悲的是 你本来可以的
And, sadly, you could have.


1653
03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:42.070
巴里 我就位了
Barry, I'm in position.


1654
03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:03.550
好 我来产生电流
Okay. I built the charge.


1655
03:20:04.180 --> 03:20:05.260
你来倒数
You call it.


1656
03:20:06.430 --> 03:20:07.680
等我倒数到一
Barry, on one.


1657
03:20:08.350 --> 03:20:10.310
三 二…
Three, two...


1658
03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:14.860
放开我
Get the hell off me!


1659
03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:16.690
维克多
Victor!


1660
03:20:52.770 --> 03:20:54.310
维克多

你自愿免费干掉蝙蝠侠
Now, you volunteered to destroy the bat free of charge.


1801
03:42:44.540 --> 03:42:46.040
为什么这么好心
Why the pro bono work?


1802
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:47.870
这是私人恩怨
It's personal.


1803
03:42:48.540 --> 03:42:51.340
让我猜 以眼还眼
Ah, let me guess, an eye for an eye?


1804
03:42:53.420 --> 03:42:55.130
你说你有我要的东西
You said you had something I'd want?


1805
03:42:55.300 --> 03:42:56.720
你最好别浪费我的时间
You'd better not be wasting my time.


1806
03:42:57.130 --> 03:43:00.800
我哪敢惹你呀 威尔森先生
Ooh. And endure your wrath, Mr. Wilson?


1807
03:43:00.970 --> 03:43:04.560
我有更重要的事要做 所以得好好活着
No, I wouldn't think of it. Uh, I have too much to live for. And more important things to do.


1808
03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:08.980
但如果你想找到蝙蝠侠
But if you want the Batman,


1809
03:43:09.150 --> 03:43:12.230
有件事可以帮你大忙
here is something that can help you.


1810
03:43:13.570 --> 03:43:17.700
他的名字是布鲁斯·韦恩
His name is Bruce Wayne.


1811
03:43:21.780 --> 03:43:23.330
现在想一想
Hmm. On second thought,


1812
03:43:25.660 --> 03:43:27.580
这件事的确值得庆祝
we do have something to celebrate.


1813
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:30.130
好样的
Good boy.


1814
03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:35.650
安全
Clear.


1815
03:44:41.150 --> 03:44:42.660
还有多远
How much further?


1816
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:45.120
就快到了
We're almost there.


1817
03:44:47.370 --> 03:44:48.910
我们得快点
Well, we need to hurry.


1818
03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:50.580
不能在外面待太久
We can't be out in the open much longer.


1819
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:52.370
他会来找我们
He'll come for us.


1820
03:44:55.340 --> 03:44:56.960
让他来
Let him come.


1821
03:44:57.460 --> 03:44:59.090
让那个混蛋来吧
Let the bastard come.


1822
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:04.340
他杀了亚瑟 我要一刀捅死他
I'll stab this through his heart for what he did to Arthur.


1823
03:45:05.140 --> 03:45:07.060
我要让他付出代价
I want to make him pay.


1824
03:45:08.770 --> 03:45:11.060
我知道你的感受 湄拉
I understand how you feel, Mera.


1825
03:45:11.560 --> 03:45:14.060
你一点都不知道
You have no idea how I feel.


1826
03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:18.690
但我们得按照计划才有机会成功
But we have to stick to the plan to have any chance to make this right.


1827
03:45:26.620 --> 03:45:30.040
你曾经爱过谁
Who have you ever loved?


1828
03:45:44.180 --> 03:45:47.350
你错了 小美人鱼
Au contraire, my little fish stick.


1829
03:45:51.100 --> 03:45:54.520
他很了解失去挚爱的感受
He knows exactly what it's like to lose someone he loves.


1830
03:45:56.480 --> 03:45:58.730
就像是…
You know, like, uh,


1831
03:46:00.070 --> 03:46:01.440
一个父亲
a father,


1832
03:46:02.900 --> 03:46:04.240
和一个母亲
like a mother.


1833
03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:08.280
你说下一句话前最好小心一点
Be very careful with the next thing you say.


1834
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:11.950
或是一个养子
Like an adopted son.


1835
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:17.330
对不对…
Isn't that right,


1836
03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:20.340
蝙蝠侠
Batman?


1837
03:46:23.590 --> 03:46:26.800
也许那只臭美人鱼是对的
Maybe, in a way, that smelly old flounder is right.


1838
03:46:28.640 --> 03:46:32.930
你对死亡麻木之前 还有多少人会死在你怀里
Because how many can die in your arms before you grow numb to death?


1839
03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:36.400
你说话一点都不小心
That's not very careful.


1840
03:46:37.650 --> 03:46:40.770
你还要看着多少死人的眼睛
And how many dead eyes can you look into


1841
03:46:41.480 --> 03:46:43.860
才会彻底心死
before you die inside yourself?


1842
03:46:44.400 --> 03:46:48.070
我已经心死了很久
I've been dead inside a long time,


1843
03:46:48.240 --> 03:46:50.160
但就连我也有忍耐极限
but even I have a limit.


1844
03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:52.040
你敢跨过那极限 我发誓会…
And if you cross that line, I swear to God, I will...


1845
03:46:52.200 --> 03:46:54.500
你会怎样 布鲁斯杀了我
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?


1846
03:46:55.210 --> 03:46:57.000
你不会杀我
You won't kill me.


1847
03:46:57.870 --> 03:46:59.840
我是你最好的朋友
I'm your best friend.


1848
03:47:00.340 --> 03:47:04.380
而且 谁会摸你的蛋蛋
Besides, who's gonna give you a reach-around?


1849
03:47:06.380 --> 03:47:07.760
反正呢
Anyway,


1850
03:47:09.050 --> 03:47:10.600
你需要我
you need me.


1851
03:47:11.640 --> 03:47:13.140
你…
You


1852
03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:19.310
让她死以后造成的这个世界 需要我帮你恢复原状
need me to help you undo this world you created by letting her die.


1853
03:47:21.900 --> 03:47:23.150
可怜的露易丝
Poor Lois.


1854
03:47:23.940 --> 03:47:26.740
她受尽了折磨
How she suffered so!


1855
03:47:32.620 --> 03:47:34.080
我常常在想
I often wonder


1856
03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:39.170
你在多少个平行时空毁灭世界 老实说…
how many alternate timelines do you destroy the world because...


1857
03:47:40.330 --> 03:47:44.500
都是因为你没种让自己死
frankly, you don't have the cojones to die yourself.


1858
03:47:49.090 --> 03:47:52.890
所以我还是一样比你更成熟
So, as usual, I'll be the bigger man.


1859
03:47:56.730 --> 03:47:58.190
停战吧
A truce,


1860
03:47:59.020 --> 03:48:00.310
布鲁斯
Bruce.


1861
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:07.150
只要你有这张牌 我们就停战
As long as you have this card, a truce.


1862
03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:13.410
但你只要把它撕成一半 我就很乐意跟你谈谈
But all you have to do is tear it in half and I'm happy to discuss with you


1863
03:48:13.580 --> 03:48:16.580
你为什么要派那个神奇小子
in any way you like, why you sent the Boy Wonder


1864
03:48:18.330 --> 03:48:20.170
去做一个男人的工作
to do a man's job?


1865
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:25.380
真的很好笑
You know, it's funny


1866
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:28.590
你竟然敢说有多少人死在我怀里
that you would talk about people who died in my arms


1867
03:48:28.760 --> 03:48:30.470
当我把哈莉·奎茵抱在怀里
because when I held Harley Quinn


1868
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:33.100
她满身是血 奄奄一息时
and she was bleeding and dying,


1869
03:48:33.260 --> 03:48:36.810
她用最后一口气哀求我
she begged me with her last breath


1870
03:48:36.970 --> 03:48:39.230
当我杀你的时候
that when I killed you,


1871
03:48:39.390 --> 03:48:42.810
别搞错 我一定会他妈的杀了你
and make no mistake, I will fucking kill you...


1872
03:48:42.980 --> 03:48:44.820
她要我慢慢来
that I'd do it slow.


1873
03:48:46.020 --> 03:48:47.990
我会信守这个承诺
I'm gonna honor that promise.


1874
03:49:19.770 --> 03:49:21.350
你真会演戏
Oh. You're good.


1875
03:49:25.650 --> 03:49:27.230
差点就唬住我了
You almost had me.


1876
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:47.790
我们要躲在哪里
Where are we holing up?


1877
03:49:47.960 --> 03:49:50.210
他永远不会料到的地方
Somewhere he'll never suspect.


1878
03:49:50.670 --> 03:49:53.590
还是觉得带着他是个好主意吗
Still think it was a good idea bringing him along?


1879
03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:56.220
你觉得呢
-what do you think?


1880
03:50:02.310 --> 03:50:03.310
他找到我们了
He's found us.


1881
03:51:32.480 --> 03:51:33.940
我能帮你吗
Can I help you?


1882
03:51:35.320 --> 03:51:38.820
你一定知道达克赛德不会放过地球
I'm sure you know Darkseid is not finished with Earth.


1883
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:41.990
反生命方程序就在这里
The Anti-Life Equation is here somewhere.


1884
03:51:42.160 --> 03:51:44.950
我们得赶在他之前找到它
We have to find it before he does.


1885
03:51:45.120 --> 03:51:46.830
决战时刻即将到来
There's a war coming.


1886
03:51:47.120 --> 03:51:48.870
我是来帮忙的
And I'm here to help.


1887
03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:51.290
抱歉 你是哪位
I'm sorry, who are you again?


1888
03:51:51.460 --> 03:51:56.550
我有很多名字和很多形体 就像你一样…
I've gone by many names and taken many forms. And like you,


1889
03:51:57.170 --> 03:51:59.800
我发现自己要对这世界负责
I've realized I have a stake in this world


1890
03:51:59.970 --> 03:52:02.430
我也该为它而战了
and it's time I started fighting for it.


1891
03:52:05.970 --> 03:52:08.100
我们是需要帮助
Well, we could definitely use the help.


1892
03:52:08.310 --> 03:52:11.520
所以很高兴你来了
So, glad you're here.


1893
03:52:12.770 --> 03:52:14.940
我没想过会看到地球的守护者
You know, I never thought I'd see the defenders of Earth


1894
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:17.280
会团结一致 并肩作战
united and fighting as one.


1895
03:52:18.280 --> 03:52:20.660
没有你就不会发生 布鲁斯
It wouldn't have happened without you, Bruce.


1896
03:52:22.120 --> 03:52:24.490
你父母会为你感到骄傲
Your mother and father would be proud.


1897
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:27.040
希望如此
I hope so.


1898
03:52:33.090 --> 03:52:36.050
我会保持联系
Well, I'll be in touch.


1899
03:52:37.090 --> 03:52:41.130
对了 有些人叫我…
Oh, and some have called me


1900
03:52:41.300 --> 03:52:43.600
火星猎人
the Martian Manhunter.


1901
03:52:51.310 --> 03:52:53.650
我猜我会再见到你
I guess I'll see you around.


1902
03:53:24.090 --> 03:53:30.190
献给秋
