00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:57.495
I'm turning
Barbecue City


159
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.790
over to you.

160
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.625
Excuse me?

161
00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:04.293
What?

162
00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:06.087
Don't shit me.

163
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.255
I'm serious!

164
00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:10.258
Oh, my God, Joe!
I just got goose bumps!


165
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.635
Yes.
I got goose bumps all over!


166
00:08:12.718 --> 00:08:14.318
I don't know what to say, man!
Thank you!


167
00:08:14.553 --> 00:08:17.390
No, thank you, son.

168
00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:20.351
Whatchu talkin' bout, Joe?
(LAUGHING)


169
00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:22.853
You better come here,
Mr. Drummond.


170
00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:25.940
All yours, Teddy.

171
00:08:27.483 --> 00:08:28.901
What do you think?
Oh...


172
00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:30.486
It's amazing.

173
00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:31.570
Really?
Yeah.


174
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:33.781
But as your unofficial
financial adviser,


175
00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:37.285
I'm obligated to tell you that this
ring is way out of your budget.


176
00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:38.536
Relax.

177
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:40.413
Lisa's cool as hell.
She knows who you are.


178
00:08:40.496 --> 00:08:42.415
Lisa does not
know who I am.


179
00:08:42.498 --> 00:08:45.209
Lisa knows that I'm a
successful barbecue salesman.


180
00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:47.670
Marvin knows that Teddy's
a high school dropout


181
00:08:47.753 --> 00:08:49.088
who's living paycheck
to paycheck


182
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:51.149
'cause I'm with a woman that's
way above my weight class.


183
00:08:51.173 --> 00:08:54.010
Your life is built on
a financial house of cards.


184
00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:55.886
Stop it.
The Porsche, the duplex.


185
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.346
What are you
trying to prove?


186
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.474
Plus, every single time we go out,
she offers to pay for the check.


187
00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:02.286
The day that I let her
put down her plastic


188
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.477
is the day
that I lose her.


189
00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:05.539
And you know that. I don't
know why I was so nervous.


190
00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:06.564
It's come together.

191
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:07.815
Hey.
Hi.


192
00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:08.899
Lisa.

193
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:10.276
Hi.

194
00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:13.362
Dude, Lisa's the best thing
that ever happened to me.


195
00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:15.323
I don't wanna
mess this one up, man.


196
00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:16.699
(ALL LAUGHING)

197
00:09:16.782 --> 00:09:17.950
I told them.
He did.


198
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:20.328
He actually said that.
MARVIN: Ooh!


199
00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:21.912
Some dessert.
That looks amazing.


200
00:09:22.163 --> 00:09:23.456
Wow. Thank you.
Wow.


201
00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:26.417
Chef Clemont also said that
there will be no check.


202
00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:28.669
This is all on him.

203
00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:29.879
Wow.

204
00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:31.005
I knew he would try this.

205
00:09:31.088 --> 00:09:33.758
You know what? Tell him I appreciate
it, but I insist on paying.


206
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:35.343
Okay.
Okay, well, just wait.


207
00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:37.094
Well, hold on
now, honey.


208
00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:39.740
Honey, you don't want to offend him.
You're his guest, right?


209
00:09:39.764 --> 00:09:41.366
Trust me, you never take
a free meal from a client.


210
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.659
That way, you don't
owe them anything.


211
00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:43.683
That's true.

212
00:09:43.768 --> 00:09:45.608
Thank you, Lisa. Appreciate it.
LISA: You know.


213
00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:47.855
Whenever you're ready.
LISA: Thank you.


214
00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:50.917
You know what then, baby?
If that's the case, then let me...


215
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:54.111
No. Baby, this is my thing.
There's, like, eight of us. I got it.


216
00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:55.988
You can probably
write it off, right? Yes.


217
00:09:56.238 --> 00:09:58.574
I didn't think about that.
It is a business expense. Okay.


218
00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.785
Come on.
MAYA: Wait, wait. Hold up, Lis.


219
00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.162
It is a business
expense, but, Lis,


220
00:10:03.245 --> 00:10:05.331
it's clear that Teddy
really wants to treat.


221
00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:09.126
We're out here celebrating you.
Let him.


222
00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:12.088
Right, Teddy?

223
00:10:12.922 --> 00:10:14.757
Yes.
Wow.


224
00:10:14.924 --> 00:10:16.008
Yes.

225
00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:18.719
Why aren't we closer?
'Cause you get me.


226
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:20.262
I have it. I got it.

227
00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:21.597
I love you.
Love you back.


228
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:23.933
Black love.
TEDDY: Okay.


229
00:10:24.308 --> 00:10:25.851
Oh, shit.

230
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.687
All right, Marvin. Hit me.
Thank you.


231
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:30.749
It's so good. LISA: One of my
favorite things that he does.


232
00:10:30.773 --> 00:10:32.959
That caramel tart, he's known for it.
TEDDY: (EXHALES) All right.


233
00:10:32.983 --> 00:10:36.070
Oh, I gotta get in that.
Definitely gonna try that.


234
00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:38.072
Mmm-mmm.
MAYA: So amazing.


235
00:10:38.155 --> 00:10:39.800
LISA: Aren't these beautiful?
He did these just for us.


236
00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:41.802
MAYA: Did he?
LISA: Yeah. You should try this caramel.


237
00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:44.036
I'm gonna take a little bit of it.
Get in there.


238
00:10:44.453 --> 00:10:46.122
Take me through.
Lisa, take me through.


239
00:10:46.205 --> 00:10:48.082
So this is a chair.
Straight up, it's a chair.


240
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.625
I know that much.

241
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.061
Give me the <i>Behind the
Music</i> about the chair.


242
00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:52.437
Pretend I'm on VH1
or something like that.


243
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.398
Well, actually, these chairs
have a very interesting story.


244
00:10:54.422 --> 00:10:57.007
They're from Denmark. Found them
in a warehouse. MARVIN: Whoa...


245
00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:00.428
Mid-century, modern,
kind of rounded.


246
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.906
MARVIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know it's blue and stuff like that.


247
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.324
LISA: I didn't know you were so
into chairs. (GROANS SOFTLY)


248
00:11:04.348 --> 00:11:05.391
You would not believe.

249
00:11:05.474 --> 00:11:07.285
I'll go home, I'll look at my chair,
I get turned on in a second.


250
00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:08.829
It's just a weird fetish of mine.
LISA: You would love these.


251
00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:11.164
Because I don't know if you noticed
the cerulean kind of undertone


252
00:11:11.188 --> 00:11:14.400
of the wallpaper, but we kind of
wanted to tie it all together


253
00:11:14.483 --> 00:11:16.777
to kind of offset the harder,
more straighter lines.


254
00:11:17.528 --> 00:11:18.946
What is that?

255
00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:21.740
Oh, my God.

256
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.742
Oh, my God!

257
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:25.202
(SPOON CLATTERING)

258
00:11:25.286 --> 00:11:26.662
No, no, no!

259
00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:28.557
LISA: What? Is there a problem
with the dessert, sir?


260
00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:30.124
I think that's pubic hair
in the cake.


261
00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:31.643
MARVIN: Oh, my God.
LISA: Oh, my gosh.


262
00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:33.586
Is this pubic hair
in my damn dessert?


263
00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:34.837
May I?

264
00:11:36.422 --> 00:11:38.215
I'm sorry, what?
May I please take it?


265
00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:39.779
Literally, I'm telling you
what it is.


266
00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:40.926
Uh...

267
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.226
This is way too many pubes.

268
00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:51.270
What does that mean?

269
00:11:51.353 --> 00:11:53.731
I mean, one is too many pubes.
If you could tell the chef.


270
00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.667
Thank you. Thank you for
taking care of this for us.


271
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:57.234
I believe you planted these.

272
00:11:58.444 --> 00:11:59.671
No, no, no.
What did you just say?


273
00:11:59.695 --> 00:12:01.780
MARVIN: Stop. I got this.
Now, that's insane of you.


274
00:12:01.864 --> 00:12:04.658
I've known this man my entire life.
He's not a pube planter, sir.


275
00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:06.118
No, no, stop, Marv. Stop.

276
00:12:06.202 --> 00:12:07.369
Maybe you planted them.

277
00:12:07.453 --> 00:12:08.746
What?
Boom.


278
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:10.098
I risked my life
coming to this country


279
00:12:10.122 --> 00:12:12.416
so I can plant pubes on some
random guy's cheesecake?


280
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.860
I don't know
what you're into, man.


281
00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:16.879
And I have a flash of news for you, guy.
I manscape down here.


282
00:12:16.962 --> 00:12:20.257
Okay. That's my woman,
and that's too much information.


283
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:24.345
And these are the pubes of
an African-American guy.


284
00:12:24.428 --> 00:12:26.388
MARVIN: Oh, shit.
What? That's racist, man.


285
00:12:26.472 --> 00:12:28.265
It's descriptive.

286
00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:29.892
Descriptive, my ass.
That's racist.


287
00:12:29.975 --> 00:12:32.603
Luis. That's what they are.
Afro-pubes.


288
00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.831
Friends, friends, what is happening?
What is happening?


289
00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:35.981
Pubes and racism.

290
00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:37.107
TEDDY: Chef Clemont...

291
00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:38.984
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

292
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.671
(IN ENGLISH) All right? I go to
take a bite of my cheesecake,


293
00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:43.989
there's what appears to be
pubic hair in my cake.


294
00:12:44.073 --> 00:12:47.618
That he planted with his
African-American short and curly pubes.


295
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:50.305
Say African-American again,
and I'mma get dark and curly in your ass!


296
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:52.289
I will say it again!
Say it again!


297
00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:54.267
LUIS: You want to dance?
'Cause I'll boogie-woogie.


298
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:56.669
Please, everyone calm down.
I am mortified by this.


299
00:12:56.752 --> 00:12:58.170
I am so sorry, everyone.

300
00:12:58.837 --> 00:12:59.964
The meal is on me.

301
00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:01.927
No. This is what he wants.
Thank you, thank you.


302
00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:03.401
Luis, I need to speak
to you in the kitchen. (SLAMS SPOON)


303
00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:04.468
Go in the kitchen, man.

304
00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:05.678
You're going to die.

305
00:13:06.136 --> 00:13:07.572
Luis, I need to speak to you
in the kitchen.


306
00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:09.306
You messed with the wrong guy.

307
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.808
Luis, right now.

YOUNG TEDDY: <i>Stewart,
what is your problem with me?</i>


461
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.938
My problem
with you, Teddy,


462
00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:34.208
is that students like you bring down
the reputation of this high school.

(MOCKING)

464
00:19:35.442 --> 00:19:37.402
You may have everybody else
at this school fooled,


465
00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:38.921
but I know you're actually
covering up


466
00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:40.965
for the fact that you're
really just not that smart.


467
00:19:40.989 --> 00:19:43.867
In fact, you might be the
dumbest student at this school.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

I am the

470
00:19:57.464 --> 00:19:59.758
I don't know the first thing
about teaching biology.

STEWART: Oh, for God's sakes!

472
00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:06.014
What part of "There is no musical
program" do you not understand, Trish?


473
00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:09.309
Nobody's getting into Ivy League
schools on a bassoon scholarship.

YOUNG TEDDY: <i>You know,
I'm not book smart.</i>


476
00:20:11.603 --> 00:20:14.815
Stewart's smarter than me.
But you know what I'm not?


477
00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:16.650
I'm not a freak
of nature, Stew.


478
00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:17.818
Uh-oh, Stew.

479
00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:19.319
Don't do this, Teddy.

480
00:20:19.403 --> 00:20:21.196
Hey, quick question,
everybody.


481
00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:23.949
Has anybody here ever seen
Stewart with his shirt off?


482
00:20:24.032 --> 00:20:26.201
It's a birthmark!
It's a birthmark!


483
00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:28.012
If it's a birthmark,
let us see it right now.


484
00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:30.497
Prove it! You all wanna
see my birthmark?


485
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.581
Come on, I'm dying!

486
00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:32.874

You got a pig's butthole
on your chest, man.

00:20:39.923 --> 00:20:42.008
There's no hole in it,
so how could it be a butthole?

We had good times,
didn't we?

I laugh at how much
we laughed.

(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

498
00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:12.205
So, how long you been
the principal, man?


499
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:13.457
Going on two years.

500
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.541
Wow.
Yeah.


501
00:21:14.624 --> 00:21:19.629
Wasn't easy, but cleaned this place
up using my brain and my bat.


502
00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:21.524
As opposed to when
we went to high school,


503
00:21:21.548 --> 00:21:24.217
now if you have a D average,
you're out.


504
00:21:24.301 --> 00:21:25.635
Can you do that?

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:27.387
I can do whatever
I want, Teddy.

This my house.

507
00:21:31.433 --> 00:21:32.744
I'm sorry.
What was the last part?


508
00:21:32.768 --> 00:21:33.935
I said look around you.

509
00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:39.566
This is my house.

510
00:21:42.944 --> 00:21:44.714
Excuse me for asking, but are
you doing a black voice?


511
00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:46.865
No. No. Not a black voice.

512
00:21:46.948 --> 00:21:48.742
You sure?
I don't hear color.

Mmm. What brings you back
to Piedmont, Mr. Walker?

from an amazing job in sales

to a job in finance.

516
00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:58.502
And the only thing that's really
holding up this transition


517
00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:01.213
is me not having my GED.

518
00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:03.089
So, I don't know,
I was thinking


519
00:22:03.173 --> 00:22:05.300
maybe I could get you to cross
some T's, dot some I's.

never change, huh, Teddy?

I wish I could. I really do.

527
00:22:22.943 --> 00:22:24.945
But you would have to go
to night school


528
00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:26.947
to learn how to pass
the GED test


529
00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:30.158
and unfortunately, we don't
offer night school here.

Why did you add AP Calculus
to my class load?


550
00:23:29.509 --> 00:23:32.012
Knowing good and well I already
have five units to teach

plus night school.
It's too much!

the night school teacher?

Wait. Hold up!

558
00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:47.962
Stewart, why did you just tell me that
you don't have night school here?


559
00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:49.154
Why would you say that?

560
00:23:49.237 --> 00:23:52.657
I said that because Teddy and
I went to school together.


561
00:23:52.741 --> 00:23:55.702
He is quite frankly
a terrible student


562
00:23:55.785 --> 00:23:57.746
and I did not want that
element in here.

That was a poor
choice of words.

I just mean, I need you
to show me the respect

that you would
show your boss.

You did the black
voice thing with him?


576

It's not a black voice.
In actuality, not a black voice.

No, you do a black voice.

You don't remember when
you was in that meeting?

You was like, "We gonna get it lit
up in here. This meeting lit."


580
00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:32.739
It was very lit.

581
00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:34.592
You did it at
the staff meeting,


582
00:24:34.616 --> 00:24:36.368
when you were like,
"I keep it 100."


583
00:24:36.451 --> 00:24:37.827
When have I never
kept it 100?

Calculus to my class load.

here's a textbook.

No, I didn't think that.

Go to the library then.

we got married after he knocked
me up, then we had two more kids.

I'm so psyched.


761
00:32:38.432 --> 00:32:39.559
Cool!

762
00:32:39.642 --> 00:32:42.687
Look at you, all cute,
making America great again.


763
00:32:43.104 --> 00:32:44.147
Bitch.

764
00:32:45.189 --> 00:32:46.816
So what's your
story, guy?


765
00:32:47.024 --> 00:32:51.112
My name is Luis Flores.
I had a great job as a waiter.


766
00:32:51.195 --> 00:32:53.072
A lot of money in tips

767
00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:55.825
until I was fired
without cause.


768
00:32:56.409 --> 00:32:57.535
No reason at all.

769
00:32:57.618 --> 00:32:58.870
Fired.

770
00:33:01.038 --> 00:33:03.749
I don't know why.
I have no idea why he's lookin' at me.


771
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:05.251
It's fine.

772
00:33:05.334 --> 00:33:08.004
It's just a sign that it's time
for me to do something different.


773
00:33:08.462 --> 00:33:10.715
You see, I came to this
country from Mexico


774
00:33:10.798 --> 00:33:12.693
to fulfill my dream of
being a singer-songwriter.


775
00:33:12.717 --> 00:33:14.302
Oh, like Julio Iglesias?

776
00:33:14.385 --> 00:33:16.888
No, not like Julio Iglesias.

777
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.514
He sucks.

778
00:33:19.473 --> 00:33:23.102
More like Justin Bieber
or Justin Timberlake.


779
00:33:23.186 --> 00:33:24.353
Or T
-Pain.

780
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:25.980
(LAUGHING)

781
00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:27.690
MILA: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

782
00:33:27.773 --> 00:33:30.693
Aren't you a little old
to be a pop star now?


783
00:33:30.776 --> 00:33:32.320
Aren't you a little
young to die?


784
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.323
That's what's up.

785
00:33:36.324 --> 00:33:39.911
But now I'm going to become
a dental hygienist.


786
00:33:40.828 --> 00:33:42.121
'Cause I have great teeth.

787
00:33:43.331 --> 00:33:44.790
So I think I'd be a natural.

788
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:48.169
A what?
Dental hygienist.


789
00:33:49.879 --> 00:33:51.047
Maybe you should see one.

790
00:33:51.714 --> 00:33:54.467
'Cause you know what?
Pretty stinky, guys.


791
00:33:54.884 --> 00:33:56.928
All right! Hey, everybody,
I'm Mackenzie.


792
00:33:57.637 --> 00:33:58.679
They call me Big Mac.

793
00:33:58.804 --> 00:34:00.431
Oh. We love McDonald's.

794
00:34:01.182 --> 00:34:03.976
What?
McDonald's?


795
00:34:04.435 --> 00:34:05.436
I'm sorry, what?

796
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.521
From the burger joint,
Mickey D's?


797
00:34:08.814 --> 00:34:10.316
Ronald McDonald's?

798
00:34:11.651 --> 00:34:14.278
Two all-beef patties,
special sauce, lettuce, cheese


799
00:34:14.612 --> 00:34:16.405
on a sesame seed bun?
Hmm...


800
00:34:16.906 --> 00:34:18.115
Never heard of it?

801
00:34:19.075 --> 00:34:20.451
Uh...

802
00:34:21.911 --> 00:34:24.789
Ooh.
It's gonna be a long semester.


803
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:26.582
Go on.

804
00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:31.254
Well, anyway, my knees and
my back are really jacked up


805
00:34:31.337 --> 00:34:33.923
from working at He-Man
Movers for 30 years.


806
00:34:34.006 --> 00:34:36.759
So I decided to get my GED

807
00:34:36.842 --> 00:34:39.095
so that I could move up
to a management position.


808
00:34:39.178 --> 00:34:40.429
Get off the truck.

809
00:34:40.513 --> 00:34:44.600
And my son, we call him Little Mac,
he has decided to drop out of school.


810
00:34:44.684 --> 00:34:45.935
So I made
a deal with him.


811
00:34:46.018 --> 00:34:48.980
I get my GED,
he gets his diploma.


812
00:34:50.314 --> 00:34:52.066
Little reverse psychology!

813
00:34:52.817 --> 00:34:53.859
All right.

814
00:34:54.443 --> 00:34:55.695
And what's your name?

815
00:34:55.778 --> 00:34:57.154
<i>Hey, yo, what up? 
I'm Bobby.</i>

816
00:34:57.238 --> 00:34:58.990
That's what
I'm talking about.


817
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.784
That's Illuminati!
That's what I'm saying!


818
00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:03.661
See, the nigga here,
but he ain't here!


819
00:35:03.744 --> 00:35:07.123
It's like they watchin' you and
you think you watchin' them!


820
00:35:07.206 --> 00:35:09.834
That's what they do!
So you got Bobby Digital.


821
00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:11.711
He here, but he not.

822
00:35:11.794 --> 00:35:14.171
That's Tupac Coachella.
You know what I'm saying?


823
00:35:15.047 --> 00:35:16.841
You see? Y'all don't...

824
00:35:16.924 --> 00:35:18.301
All right.

825
00:35:18.384 --> 00:35:20.344
That probably ain't even
a real nigga. Hey.


826
00:35:20.428 --> 00:35:22.555
Are you on crack? It's Skype.

827
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:28.185
(SCOFFS) Ooh, boy, it's hard to be woke.
It's hard to be woke.


828
00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:31.564
What is "woke"?

829
00:35:31.647 --> 00:35:34.400
Okay, well,
welcome, everyone.


830
00:35:34.483 --> 00:35:36.110
Really nice, we've all met.

831
00:35:36.193 --> 00:35:38.988
We didn't meet everyone.

832
00:35:39.071 --> 00:35:40.156
I didn't...
Teddy.


833
00:35:40.614 --> 00:35:45.286
Earlier, you said, unlike these folks,
you're not a night school type of person.


834
00:35:46.412 --> 00:35:48.331
So I didn't think you cared.

835
00:35:48.414 --> 00:35:50.124
LUIS: Is that right?

836
00:35:51.417 --> 00:35:53.210
You didn't hear it right,

837
00:35:53.294 --> 00:35:56.213
'cause I would never say that
about people that I don't know.


838
00:35:56.297 --> 00:35:58.007
You know what?
This is a perfect segue.


839
00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.926
I'll just follow your lead,
and I'll stand up.


840
00:36:01.135 --> 00:36:02.762
I am Teddy Walker.

841
00:36:02.845 --> 00:36:04.889
A little fun fact about me,
I actually went here.


842
00:36:05.514 --> 00:36:07.475
Oh.
I'm also newly engaged.


843
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.268
His fiancée is
out of his league.


844
00:36:09.352 --> 00:36:10.478
I'm sorry, what?

845
00:36:10.561 --> 00:36:14.523
Nothing. You're doing great. I said,
"Keep going. Everybody loves you."


846
00:36:14.982 --> 00:36:17.360
How does your fiancée feel about
you being in night school?


847
00:36:17.443 --> 00:36:18.569
She good!

848
00:36:19.779 --> 00:36:20.780
She loves it!

849
00:36:21.405 --> 00:36:22.782
He ain't told her shit.

850
00:36:22.865 --> 00:36:24.033
TEDDY: She loves it!

851
00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:26.994
I noticed that your voice just
went up a whole octave.


852
00:36:27.536 --> 00:36:30.664
Now, from my studies of
psychology in grad school,


853
00:36:30.748 --> 00:36:33.292
I know that that means
that you're bullshitting.


854
00:36:33.376 --> 00:36:34.585
Ain't no bullshit in me.

855
00:36:35.753 --> 00:36:37.856
I tell you what, if you're lying
with her, don't lie to her.


856
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.006
But I don't lie.

857
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.549
<i>Sound like
some bullshit to me.</i>


858
00:36:40.674 --> 00:36:43.010
Everyone sees right through you.
Okay, how about we...


859
00:36:43.094 --> 00:36:45.388
If we go by your theory,
about the voice thing...


860
00:36:45.471 --> 00:36:47.181
I think that we're all
gettin' off track.


861
00:36:47.264 --> 00:36:48.265
He's lied four times.

862
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:50.643
<i>This boy definitely lying.</i>
I am not.


863
00:36:50.726 --> 00:36:53.729
You can't outsmart Mother Nature.
And that's what a woman is.


864
00:36:53.813 --> 00:36:55.439
Brother.
Especially a black woman.


865
00:36:55.523 --> 00:36:56.816
That's correct.

866
00:36:56.899 --> 00:36:58.168
Girls are smart, dude.
MAC: Is she pretty?


867
00:36:58.192 --> 00:36:59.860
God damn it.
Like, literally, damn it.


868
00:36:59.985 --> 00:37:01.797
Even if he didn't tell her, so what?
Okay, here's the thing...


869
00:37:01.821 --> 00:37:04.573
I told Randy that he was the first
guy I slept with. Not true.


870
00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:06.283
I'm trying
to introduce myself...


871
00:37:06.367 --> 00:37:07.910
You don't respect your queen,

872
00:37:07.993 --> 00:37:09.471
'cause if you did, that bitch
would know where you at.


873
00:37:09.495 --> 00:37:12.373
TEDDY: Okay. Teddy. Don't lie
to your queen.


874
00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:13.457
Okay, guys.

875
00:37:13.541 --> 00:37:14.810
If you're busting off
in her guts like that,


876
00:37:14.834 --> 00:37:16.074
she might be
carrying your seed.


877
00:37:16.127 --> 00:37:17.354
I feel like this
conversation's...


878
00:37:17.378 --> 00:37:18.939
So you ain't just lyin' to her.
You lyin' to your child.


879
00:37:18.963 --> 00:37:20.005
Shit!

880
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:22.109
If it's your bottom bitch,
she know you stupid, fam.


881
00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:23.235
All I'm sayin', fam...
Forget it.


882
00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:24.301
Okay!

883
00:37:24.385 --> 00:37:26.679
How your fiancée don't know
where you at? It's after dark.


884
00:37:26.762 --> 00:37:28.639
This ain't Halloween, fam.
I'm done.


885
00:37:29.014 --> 00:37:31.392
My sister know
where I'm at. Okay?


886
00:37:31.475 --> 00:37:33.436
And she live all the way
in Arkansas.


887
00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:35.646
Okay, here's the deal, class.

888
00:37:36.564 --> 00:37:40.401
You will be given homework every
night, just like regular high school.


889
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.279
(GROANS)
And now, a pop quiz


890
00:37:43.362 --> 00:37:46.782
just so I can get a better
idea of where you all are.


891
00:37:46.907 --> 00:37:48.909
Wait, we got a test
on the first day?


892
00:37:49.076 --> 00:37:53.247
Teddy, it's a pop quiz.
Okay? Look here, folks.


893
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:56.584
I am here to teach
if you're here to learn.


894
00:37:56.667 --> 00:38:00.337
Otherwise, you can get
outta my class right now.


895
00:38:01.005 --> 00:38:02.298
That's what's up.

896
00:38:02.715 --> 00:38:04.508
Welcome to night school.

897
00:38:07.595 --> 00:38:08.679
There you go.

898
00:38:08.762 --> 00:38:11.682
It was terrible,
man! Terrible!


899
00:38:11.765 --> 00:38:14.310
Like, she's not like the teachers
that we had back in the day.


900
00:38:14.393 --> 00:38:16.353
<i>What?</i>
This woman is a brick wall.


901
00:38:16.437 --> 00:38:17.813
And I can't work her.

902
00:38:17.897 --> 00:38:20.065
I can't work a brick wall.

903
00:38:20.232 --> 00:38:21.275
What are you doing?

904
00:38:21.442 --> 00:38:23.242
I'm working out.
I'm trying to shed some lb's.


905
00:38:23.277 --> 00:38:25.529
<i>I wanna feel fit.</i>
Why am I even asking?


906
00:38:25.613 --> 00:38:27.740
<i>In the meantime, please
stop paying for everything</i>


907
00:38:27.823 --> 00:38:29.992
<i>and you have
to get a temp job.</i>


908
00:38:30.493 --> 00:38:32.953
You don't think I've been
looking for a job?


909
00:38:33.037 --> 00:38:35.039
<i>What are you, crazy?
I'm on a treadmill!</i>


910
00:38:35.122 --> 00:38:36.624
The jobs that I want,

911
00:38:36.707 --> 00:38:39.460
they are not going to give
to a high school dropout.


912
00:38:39.543 --> 00:38:42.713
<i>Well, you can't keep lying to Lisa.

Thank you.

That's fine with me.

1072
00:45:30.454 --> 00:45:33.582
Okay, so if we're gonna do this,
let's do it step by step.


1073
00:45:33.665 --> 00:45:34.865
Let's make sure
we do it right.

let's get rid of this line.

Because it's written sloppy.

1076

So let's get that baby neat.
Eight!

Right?
Huh.


1078
00:45:43.592 --> 00:45:46.136
We got these three sides.
Got a, b, c. Split that.


1079

That's there.

Because that's
what confuses you.


1082
00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:53.935
And then,

1083
00:45:54.936 --> 00:45:56.563
you're realizing what it is.
Eight!


1084
00:45:56.647 --> 00:45:57.898
The answer's five.

1085
00:45:58.732 --> 00:46:03.153
It's five. Easy. Okay, you're
looking at five squared.


1086
00:46:03.236 --> 00:46:06.406
Me up here, I don't have time.
I don't have time.


1087
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.116
Why do I even
waste my time?


1088
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.927
I don't got time to waste my
time on the Pythagorean theorem.


1089
00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:11.119
It's simple.

impressive, Teddy.

00:57:52.445 --> 00:57:53.922
Right, right.
We can email you directly.


1362
00:57:53.946 --> 00:57:55.299
STEWART: Thank you.
WOMAN: That would be great.


1363
00:57:55.323 --> 00:57:57.593
Send out that email tonight, okay?
Thanks so much. Okay. Bye!


1364
00:57:57.617 --> 00:57:59.619
Drive home safe.
Oh, hey!


1365
00:58:00.536 --> 00:58:01.579
Hi.

1366
00:58:01.662 --> 00:58:03.581
Thank you for that great,
wonderful meeting.


1367
00:58:03.664 --> 00:58:05.083
I'm sorry,
do I know you?


1368
00:58:05.166 --> 00:58:07.043
I was in there.
Remember?


1369
00:58:07.752 --> 00:58:10.213
Yes, yes, yes.
Hi. Mrs. Howerton.


1370
00:58:10.296 --> 00:58:12.048
Mrs. Howerton.
Yes, of course.


1371
00:58:12.131 --> 00:58:14.467
No, you brought up
several compelling issues.


1372
00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:15.635
I sure did.

1373
00:58:15.718 --> 00:58:16.987
STEWART: Well, what can
I help you with?


1374
00:58:17.011 --> 00:58:19.263
She sucks at this. Hurry!
I'm almost there.


1375
00:58:19.347 --> 00:58:22.308
So my child gets an assignment
about the solar system,


1376
00:58:22.392 --> 00:58:23.893
and it's to make
a diorama.


1377
00:58:23.976 --> 00:58:25.579
And he doesn't know how
to make a diorama.


1378
00:58:25.603 --> 00:58:27.456
I'm the one with the hot glue
gun in the middle of the night.


1379
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.707
It's 11:00 p.m.
I mean, don't get me wrong.


1380
00:58:28.731 --> 00:58:30.125
We're blessed to go to
school here, but I'm...


1381
00:58:30.149 --> 00:58:31.251
STEWART: I'm sorry,
I have to go.


1382
00:58:31.275 --> 00:58:32.693
Okay? Call my office.
Hurry up!


1383
00:58:32.819 --> 00:58:34.296
THERESA: I will. I'm going, I'm going.
Calm down.


1384
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.863
Come on, Mila!

1385
00:58:35.947 --> 00:58:38.866
You've made some great points, but
I have to go now. Good night.


1386
00:58:39.909 --> 00:58:41.119
Wait a minute!

1387
00:58:41.202 --> 00:58:42.995
Thank you. I have to go.
I really have to go.


1388
00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:44.580
Wait! No! Wait, wait, wait!
What?


1389
00:58:44.664 --> 00:58:45.748
(GROANS)
(GASPS)


1390
00:58:45.832 --> 00:58:48.042
Are you okay?
I feel faint.


1391
00:58:48.126 --> 00:58:49.326
Well, let's get you
some water.


1392
00:58:49.919 --> 00:58:52.672
Thanks for catching me.
Of course. Are you all right?


1393
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:57.426
Are you having a seizure?

1394
00:58:59.929 --> 00:59:01.472
Do you have something
in your teeth?


1395
00:59:01.556 --> 00:59:03.057
I wish I had you in my teeth.

1396
00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:06.644
No, no, no, no. Okay. No. I didn't
realize that's what this was.


1397
00:59:06.727 --> 00:59:08.354
No, thank you. Ma'am.
Gentle touching!


1398
00:59:08.437 --> 00:59:10.707
I am the principal of your child's school.
I have to walk away now.


1399
00:59:10.731 --> 00:59:11.792
I am in a loveless
marriage. Please.


1400
00:59:11.816 --> 00:59:13.025
I am not
participating in this!


1401
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:14.586
You don't have to participate.
Too unprofessional.


1402
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:17.029
I'll do all the work.
I'll do it all. No, I'm...


1403
00:59:17.155 --> 00:59:19.365
If you just look me in the eyes...
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!


1404
00:59:19.448 --> 00:59:20.533
Not appropriate, okay?

1405
00:59:20.616 --> 00:59:22.702
Okay. Here it is.
If this is what you want.


1406
00:59:22.785 --> 00:59:23.929
This is what
it's about with you.


1407
00:59:23.953 --> 00:59:25.413
No, no, no, no!
I am not looking.


1408
00:59:25.496 --> 00:59:28.082
Crack it open like a walnut.
Thank you. No, thank you.


1409
00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:30.418
Crack that nut like a walnut.
Thank you. No, thank you.


1410
00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:33.504
Crack that nut open!
Thank you. No, thank you.


1411
00:59:33.588 --> 00:59:36.257
Do what men do with women's asses.
Oh, man!


1412
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.734
Just tap it!
I can't stand here for this, okay?


1413
00:59:37.758 --> 00:59:39.302
Give it a rat-tat-tap!
Good night!


1414
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:42.013
(PANTING)

1415
00:59:42.263 --> 00:59:43.598
Oh, that was so hard.

1416
00:59:44.182 --> 00:59:45.892
She wanted you so bad.

1417
00:59:46.809 --> 00:59:48.227
But you can't go there.

1418
00:59:49.103 --> 00:59:51.147
Principals have principles.

1419
00:59:51.772 --> 00:59:53.107
(GRUNTS)

1420
00:59:53.191 --> 00:59:56.861
Oh, but you know Stewie would've
tore that ass up though! (CHUCKLES)


1421
00:59:57.904 --> 00:59:59.447
Not a black voice.

1422
01:00:10.666 --> 01:00:11.834
(TYPING)

1423
01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:42.531
(SNEEZES)

1424
01:00:43.908 --> 01:00:44.992
Hello?

1425
01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:46.786
Hello?

1426
01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:48.454
Somebody in here?

1427
01:00:54.794 --> 01:00:55.795
I have a bat

1428
01:00:56.629 --> 01:00:58.047
and I'm not afraid to use it.

1429
01:00:59.257 --> 01:01:02.718
If there is someone in here,
you are trespassing


1430
01:01:03.803 --> 01:01:05.763
and I am well within
my rights


1431
01:01:06.847 --> 01:01:08.391
to defend myself.

1432
01:01:09.225 --> 01:01:13.479
So come on out,
and I won't bash your head.


1433
01:01:14.897 --> 01:01:16.649
MAN: Help!

1434
01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:18.693
Anybody out there?

1435
01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:20.152
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

1436
01:01:21.862 --> 01:01:24.824
Get me out of here! Hey!

1437
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.909
Whoa!

1438
01:01:27.034 --> 01:01:28.369
Okay.
What the hell, Mac?


1439
01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:30.788
That was close.
TEDDY: You're damn right it was, Mac.


1440
01:01:30.871 --> 01:01:32.039
I wonder why.

1441
01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:33.708
Yeah. It's 'cause I sneezed.

1442
01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:35.126
I know what you did.

1443
01:01:35.209 --> 01:01:37.169
What?
I got it.


1444
01:01:39.922 --> 01:01:42.383
I really tried.
I even did the butt stuff.


1445
01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:44.135
I told you
don't do the butt stuff.


1446
01:01:44.218 --> 01:01:45.362
I don't know, fam.
It might have worked.


1447
01:01:45.386 --> 01:01:47.626
It looked like he might've
sauced his drawers, real talk.


1448
01:01:48.014 --> 01:01:49.765
He what?
He was turned on.


1449
01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:52.226
Really?
Shit, I was, too.


1450
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:53.394
Hey!

1451
01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:54.478
Thanks, Jaylen.

1452
01:01:54.562 --> 01:01:56.402
You've got that little
eco-friendly vibe going.


1453
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.815
What's "eco-friendly"?

1454
01:01:57.898 --> 01:01:59.150
Very little waist.

1455
01:01:59.442 --> 01:02:01.193
Oh, I thought
you meant her bush.


1456
01:02:01.277 --> 01:02:03.612
No. Oh, you know what?
I'm with that.


1457
01:02:03.696 --> 01:02:05.239
Hey, now!

1458
01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:06.782
Okay, Jaylen, Jaylen!

1459
01:02:06.866 --> 01:02:08.159
We gotta go, y'all. Let's go.

1460
01:02:08.242 --> 01:02:09.618
Yeah, let's go.
Come on. Come on.


1461
01:02:09.702 --> 01:02:10.703
TEDDY: Shit.

1462
01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:17.626
MAN: Who's out there?
(POUNDING ON DOOR)


1463
01:02:17.793 --> 01:02:19.754
Somebody help me, please.

1464
01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:23.758
What happened?

1465
01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:24.842
I don't know.

1466
01:02:24.925 --> 01:02:27.321
Someone grabbed me from behind
and threw me in the slop sink.


1467
01:02:27.345 --> 01:02:29.388
Game face, Lonnie.

1468
01:02:30.806 --> 01:02:31.891
We're on lockdown.

1469
01:02:31.974 --> 01:02:34.226
MAC: (LAUGHING) Yeah!

1470
01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:36.070
JAYLEN: That'll get him. Hey!
(ALARM BLARING)


1471
01:02:36.103 --> 01:02:37.897
Oh, shit!
Go, go, go!


1472
01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:39.398
JAYLEN: Shit!

1473
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.985
MAC: What are we...
Hey! Shit!


1474
01:02:43.986 --> 01:02:47.448
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, shit just
got real, man, what do we do?


1475
01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.617
<i>I mean, I don't know,
just don't get shot, bro.</i>


1476
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.969
What do you mean,
"Don't get shot"?


1477
01:02:50.993 --> 01:02:53.245
Bobby, you supposed to be
a hardened criminal, man.


1478
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:54.747
That can't be your advice.

1479
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:56.470
What the hell'd you
go to jail for, Bobby?


1480
01:02:56.665 --> 01:02:59.835
<i>I rob a Whole Foods, bro.
I rob a Whole Foods.</i>


1481
01:02:59.919 --> 01:03:03.631
That's your crime? You went to
jail for stealin' the $15 lettuce?


1482
01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:06.884
<i>No, bro, you sleepin'.
I move some coke or some dope in the day,</i>


1483
01:03:06.967 --> 01:03:10.179
<i>but my kale game, my kale game...</i>
No!


1484
01:03:10.262 --> 01:03:11.847
<i>Now, that's mink!</i>

<i>Grass-fed beef, you don't know
nothin' about no free-range chicken.</i>

Thug life.

1487
01:03:16.102 --> 01:03:17.353
Wait, Jaylen.
Calm down, Jaylen.


1488
01:03:17.436 --> 01:03:18.997
<i>And I had all the farmer
markets smashed.</i> No! No!


1489
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:21.607
You don't get to explain!
You don't get to explain, Bob!


1490
01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.234
All right, y'all.

1491
01:03:23.317 --> 01:03:26.070

There is no escape.</i>

I can't believe we're gonna
die over a GED practice test!


1494
01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:34.703
It's not even a real test!
Listen.


1495
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:36.539
I just did this
to get out of the house.


1496
01:03:36.705 --> 01:03:37.945
I thought this was
gonna be fun.


1497
01:03:37.998 --> 01:03:40.143
You know, we're gonna break in...
Just shut up! Just shut up!


1498
01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:41.460
Shut up!

1499
01:03:41.544 --> 01:03:42.962
Goddamn!

1500
01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:45.548
Been talking about your kids
and everything all day!


1501
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:47.258
This ain't the time.

1502
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:48.717
Now, y'all pull it together.

1503
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:49.927
We are fine.

1504
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:51.178
We are okay.

1505
01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:52.888
The roof. Let's hit the roof.

1506
01:03:52.972 --> 01:03:55.409
Okay, when I went to school here,
that's how we got out of school,


1507
01:03:55.433 --> 01:03:57.685
and then we would jump onto
the elementary school roof.


1508
01:03:57.768 --> 01:03:58.768
Come on!

1509
01:03:59.979 --> 01:04:00.980

TEDDY: Take that 15 feet,

01:04:29.925 --> 01:04:31.760
minus the three
feet that you can jump.

What are you
talking about?


1530
01:04:33.262 --> 01:04:35.431
All we gotta do is use
the Pythagorean theorem.

Nobody was listening in class.
Nobody knows how to do that!

No, wait, wait, wait.

1533
01:04:39.435 --> 01:04:41.121
Carrie said in order to use
the Pythagorean theorem,


1534
01:04:41.145 --> 01:04:42.688
you have to know
the hypotenuse.


1535
01:04:42.771 --> 01:04:45.024
All we gotta do
is hypotenuse it.


1536
01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:47.026
A-squared plus b-squared
equals c-squared.


1537
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:48.486
If you know two sides,

1538
01:04:48.569 --> 01:04:51.339
that will help you figure out the
third, so it's roughly six feet across.


1539
01:04:51.363 --> 01:04:54.325
So 15-squared is 225
divided by 6-squared.


1540
01:04:54.408 --> 01:04:55.802
Hypotenuse it!

Ma'am.

1667
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:47.761
<i>I said I don't want the pie.</i>
Okay. Ma'am.


1668
01:09:47.785 --> 01:09:48.786
She don't want the pie.

1669
01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:49.995
Take the pie off.

1670
01:09:50.162 --> 01:09:52.456
<i>I said I ain't gettin' the pie.</i>
Pull up!


1671
01:09:52.539 --> 01:09:53.939
<i>You heard me?</i>
Pull up to the window!


1672
01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:55.667
<i>All right.</i>
When she pull up,


1673
01:09:55.834 --> 01:09:57.954
tell me, 'cause I'mma come
punch the baby in the face.


1674
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.255
God don't see everything.
Just let me know.


1675
01:10:00.422 --> 01:10:02.841
Hey, talk to me, man.
How you doing?


1676
01:10:03.926 --> 01:10:05.803
You know, I thought
it was the Woodbridge punks


1677
01:10:05.886 --> 01:10:07.280
that broke into
the school, but now,


1678
01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:08.514
it all makes sense.

1679
01:10:09.264 --> 01:10:11.517
I found this

1680
01:10:11.683 --> 01:10:13.143
at the scene
of the crime.


1681
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.397
So what'd you do?
Break into my computer?


1682
01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:18.982
Steal the midterm?

1683
01:10:19.066 --> 01:10:21.318
Being a little paranoid,
aren't we, Stew? Am I?


1684
01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:23.588
Stewart, that's a plastic bag
with a chicken wrapper in it


1685
01:10:23.612 --> 01:10:25.089
with the word
"evidence" written on it,


1686
01:10:25.113 --> 01:10:26.740
which is probably
in your handwriting.


1687
01:10:27.866 --> 01:10:29.952
It's not exactly a smoking gun,
Stew.


1688
01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:31.787
It's just
a coincidence, right?


1689
01:10:31.954 --> 01:10:32.955
Probably.

1690
01:10:33.413 --> 01:10:35.207
If you stole that test,

1691
01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:36.792
I will find out, Teddy.

1692
01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.753
I'm an honest man trying
to make an honest living.


1693
01:10:39.837 --> 01:10:42.297
Teddy Walker does not cheat.

1694
01:10:42.756 --> 01:10:44.049
You cheated.

1695
01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:48.595
Every last one of you cheated.

1696
01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:51.598
Uh... Whoa.

1697
01:10:51.807 --> 01:10:54.101
Carrie, those are very
strong accusations.


1698
01:10:54.309 --> 01:10:56.311
For real. Like, what?

1699
01:10:56.395 --> 01:10:57.563
I'm offended.

1700
01:10:57.855 --> 01:10:59.857
Well, I'll take
note of that, Teddy.


1701
01:11:00.232 --> 01:11:01.775
Which one of you
wanna own up to it?


1702
01:11:02.109 --> 01:11:03.527
I'm offended, too.

1703
01:11:04.444 --> 01:11:06.321
Bobby. You a criminal.

1704
01:11:06.405 --> 01:11:08.485
You obviously not good at it.
That's why you in jail.


1705
01:11:08.532 --> 01:11:10.367
Did you orchestrate
this whole thing?


1706
01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:13.412
<i>I mean, why you gonna pick
on me and profile me?</i>


1707
01:11:13.495 --> 01:11:15.455
<i>I'm the only one
locked up here.</i>


1708
01:11:15.622 --> 01:11:17.541
<i>So if I'm locked up in here,</i>

1709
01:11:17.624 --> 01:11:20.377
<i>how can I be out there
stealing the test, Miss Carrie?</i>


1710
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.712
CARRIE: Wait a minute!
(SIGHS)


1711
01:11:21.795 --> 01:11:22.963
Y'all stole the test?

1712
01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:24.882
I'm not sayin' nothin'.
I don't know nothin'.


1713
01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:26.425
I don't know shit.

1714
01:11:26.592 --> 01:11:29.261
'Cause I never said nothin' about
anybody stealing the test.


1715
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.597
I'm about to get to the truth.

1716
01:11:31.763 --> 01:11:33.557
Who stole the test?

1717
01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:35.434
Mac,

1718
01:11:36.101 --> 01:11:38.812
you wanna explain to me
how you got a perfect score?


1719
01:11:38.896 --> 01:11:40.147
Here's the thing.
All right?


1720
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:43.066
I know I didn't get
a perfect score.


1721
01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:44.484
Because I missed
a few on purpose.


1722

Fudge!

1723
01:11:47.863 --> 01:11:49.197
Thank you!

1724
01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:50.616
<i>You's a snitch, Mac!</i>

1725
01:11:50.699 --> 01:11:52.242
Snitches are bitches.

1726
01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.453
I don't like cheaters.

1727
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:58.624
And I hate that I am teaching
a room full of cheaters!


1728
01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:00.959
I don't like men that cheat.

1729
01:12:01.043 --> 01:12:02.628
I don't like women that cheat.

1730
01:12:02.711 --> 01:12:03.980
I don't even
deal with politicians.


1731
01:12:04.004 --> 01:12:05.881
You know why?
'Cause they all cheaters.


1732
01:12:05.964 --> 01:12:07.382
I don't even eat Cheetos.

1733
01:12:07.466 --> 01:12:09.384
You know why?
'Cause it sound like "cheaters."


1734
01:12:09.468 --> 01:12:11.929
Plus that Cheeto dust'll
give you that Trump color.


1735
01:12:12.179 --> 01:12:13.180
Yeah.

1736
01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:15.849
It's hard to get that Cheeto
dust off your hands.


1737
01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:17.559
It'll mess up your jabos.

1738
01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.436
You know,
I liked you at first.


1739
01:12:20.145 --> 01:12:22.705
I'm done with all of y'all.
All of y'all can get up out my class.


1740
01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:24.066
I'm done with y'all.
What?


1741
01:12:24.232 --> 01:12:25.793
Okay, Carrie, let me...
I wanna say something.


1742
01:12:25.817 --> 01:12:28.046
If I don't get my GED, he's
gonna drop out of high school.


1743
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:30.280
If I don't get my GED,
I'm going to prison.


1744
01:12:30.364 --> 01:12:31.615
<i>I need this GED!</i>

1745

You need to keep your booty closed.
That's what you need to do. You in jail.


1746
01:12:34.409 --> 01:12:35.827
No, I need this GED.

We can't live
on Randy's salary.


1748
01:12:37.496 --> 01:12:39.623
Please don't make me go home.
I hate my kids.


1749
01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:42.668
But I love being a mom.

1750
01:12:43.001 --> 01:12:45.337
I'm blessed. So blessed.

I wanna do

at the Best Western.

'Cause you know what that is,
right?


1758
01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.476
That's just gonna
be used condoms.

Ain't that where you met
your bottom bitch at?

You know Trina?

Mmm-hmm.

1763
01:13:07.901 --> 01:13:09.403
She got a fat ass, too.

1764
01:13:10.112 --> 01:13:12.531
You know what? All of you got
little sob stories


1765
01:13:12.614 --> 01:13:14.199
but y'all should've thought
about that


1766
01:13:14.282 --> 01:13:15.867
before you went
and stole the test.

up out my class.

You shouldn't be
mad at none of them.

I mean, yeah,
they looked at the answers,


1779

but they wouldn't have if I
hadn't had put it on their lap.


1780
01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:51.153
I take responsibility for it
all. I was the mastermind.

outside-of-the-box thinker.


1819
01:15:19.783 --> 01:15:21.201
That's just who I am.

1820
01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:24.121
I think that if students are
excited about their environment,


1821
01:15:24.204 --> 01:15:25.831
they'll be excited
about learning.


1822
01:15:26.081 --> 01:15:28.542
That makes total sense.
I know I would.


1823
01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:30.043
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1824
01:15:30.127 --> 01:15:32.671
If you're interested, I'd love to
give you a tour of the school.


1825
01:15:32.754 --> 01:15:33.964
You could come
by any day,


1826
01:15:34.047 --> 01:15:36.049
or, you know, you could even
come after school.


1827
01:15:36.133 --> 01:15:38.552
We have several night
programs as well.


1828
01:15:40.595 --> 01:15:41.972
Hey.
Hey.


1829
01:15:43.974 --> 01:15:47.102
CARRIE: Okay, show me what you got.
Show me what you got.


1830
01:15:47.269 --> 01:15:49.104
What you got for me? Come on.

1831
01:15:50.105 --> 01:15:51.106
What you got?

1832
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:53.608
You killin' me!
You won!


1833
01:15:53.775 --> 01:15:54.860
Congratulations.

1834
01:15:54.943 --> 01:15:56.444
I'm proud of you, boo.

1835
01:15:56.528 --> 01:15:59.614
Now, it's not cool that you beat
your teacher at Texas hold 'em


1836
01:15:59.698 --> 01:16:02.909
but I like the way you nailed down
the calculations on the pot odds.


1837
01:16:03.076 --> 01:16:05.245
So I'mma let this slide.

1838
01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:06.913
Now, remember
what I said.


1839
01:16:07.164 --> 01:16:08.331
There are no shortcuts.

1840
01:16:08.498 --> 01:16:10.000
You gotta work
your butt off.


1841
01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:12.043
Okay? Give me
some love.


1842
01:16:13.378 --> 01:16:14.629
I'm so proud of you.

1843
01:16:14.713 --> 01:16:16.089
Go on and have
a good day now.


1844
01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:18.300
Maybe one day
I'll take you to Vegas.


1845
01:16:25.473 --> 01:16:26.641
That was cool.

1846
01:16:28.435 --> 01:16:29.936
You know...

1847
01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.248
This used to be the Special Ed
classroom when I went here.


1848
01:16:32.272 --> 01:16:33.732
It still is.

1849
01:16:34.399 --> 01:16:35.609
You teach Special Ed?

1850
01:16:36.484 --> 01:16:38.862
Special Ed is one
of my sections.


1851
01:16:39.779 --> 01:16:41.615
It's one of my
favorites, actually.


1852
01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:47.579
You know, that kid reminds
me a lot of myself.


1853
01:16:48.163 --> 01:16:50.290
I couldn't do math for shit
when I was in school.


1854
01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:53.019
Difference is I didn't have
a teacher like you


1855
01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:54.645
that was willing to
stay behind to help me.


1856
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:56.463
I know what
you're doin', Teddy.


1857
01:16:56.546 --> 01:16:57.631
And I admit,

1858
01:16:57.714 --> 01:17:01.051
it was very cool of you to take
the fall for your classmates.


1859
01:17:02.344 --> 01:17:03.595
But you're a hustler.

1860
01:17:04.137 --> 01:17:06.348
Tryin' to skate by
without doing the work.


1861
01:17:06.514 --> 01:17:08.016
You should know
you can't hustle me.


1862
01:17:08.308 --> 01:17:09.392
I do.

1863
01:17:09.476 --> 01:17:11.770
Okay? I do know that.

1864
01:17:11.853 --> 01:17:13.688
And I promise you, I'm done.

1865
01:17:13.855 --> 01:17:15.440
I'm not hustling no more.

1866
01:17:15.857 --> 01:17:18.401
Night school is about
second chances.


1867
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.529
And if I don't get this second chance,
then it's over for me.


1868
01:17:21.905 --> 01:17:24.074
Night school
is all that I have.


1869
01:17:24.616 --> 01:17:25.617
(SIGHS)

1870
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.994
Please.

1871
01:17:28.912 --> 01:17:30.580
I'll consider it
on one condition.


1872
01:17:31.039 --> 01:17:32.249
Whatever it is.

1873
01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.084
We get you tested.

1874
01:17:34.668 --> 01:17:36.628
For STDs?
That's not an issue.


1875
01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.214
I don't mind that.
I mean...


1876
01:17:39.297 --> 01:17:40.590
God damn it.

1877
01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:44.219
There was one time where the condom popped
'cause I put my balls inside the...


1878
01:17:44.302 --> 01:17:46.429
No, you idiot.

1879
01:17:46.805 --> 01:17:48.473
For learning disabilities.

1880
01:17:50.141 --> 01:17:53.144
Nobody cares about your
escapades with your bitches.


1881
01:17:54.479 --> 01:17:56.606
TEDDY: So what are
the test results, Carrie?


1882
01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:59.025
Teddy, the issue is...

1883
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.445
You're clinically dumb.

1884
01:18:05.824 --> 01:18:07.033
I knew it.

1885
01:18:08.326 --> 01:18:10.537
I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it was a mistake.


1886
01:18:10.912 --> 01:18:12.872
Boy, I'm sorry.
I'm just messin' with you.


1887
01:18:12.956 --> 01:18:14.708
Come on, Carrie.
Look, look.


1888
01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:18.211
My suspicions were right, and you,
my friend, are dyslexic.


1889
01:18:19.087 --> 01:18:20.130
Okay.

1890
01:18:20.547 --> 01:18:22.590
Okay, so that just means
I'm having problems


1891
01:18:22.674 --> 01:18:23.943
with my reading and my writing,
right?


1892
01:18:23.967 --> 01:18:26.678
Yep. But you also have
dyscalculia.


1893
01:18:26.761 --> 01:18:28.841
Dyscalculia? I don't even
know how to pronounce that.


1894
01:18:29.055 --> 01:18:31.933
Basically, it's like dyslexia,
but with math.


1895
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.478
That's what I got.

1896
01:18:35.937 --> 01:18:38.565
I knew it! Now that you say it,
it makes sense.


1897
01:18:38.815 --> 01:18:40.918
If you take me to a restaurant and
you say, "Teddy, leave the tip,"


1898
01:18:40.942 --> 01:18:42.444
I'm all over the place.

1899
01:18:42.527 --> 01:18:44.154
That's exactly what it is.
We did it!


1900
01:18:44.237 --> 01:18:45.363
We're not done.

1901
01:18:45.447 --> 01:18:47.824
You also have
a processing disorder.


1902
01:18:47.907 --> 01:18:50.160
I got a touch
of prostate cancer?


1903
01:18:50.243 --> 01:18:51.619
She didn't touch
my ass one time.


1904
01:18:51.703 --> 01:18:54.330
I said
"processing disorder."


1905
01:18:54.497 --> 01:18:56.583
Carrie, if you're not
gonna help me,


1906
01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:57.959
then we're wasting our time.

1907
01:18:58.043 --> 01:19:00.045
Explain to me
what this stuff is.


1908
01:19:00.128 --> 01:19:02.714
If I got a processing...
Oh, my God.


1909
01:19:04.758 --> 01:19:06.092
I'm not processing it.

1910
01:19:08.053 --> 01:19:09.888
I didn't process
none of that shit.


1911
01:19:09.971 --> 01:19:14.726
You are just one big, beautiful mixed
drink of learning disabilities.


1912
01:19:14.809 --> 01:19:16.144
So I'm not dumb?

1913
01:19:16.227 --> 01:19:18.271
Boy, I was just playin'
when I said that earlier.


1914
01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:21.107
No good teacher would ever
call their students dumb.


1915
01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:22.609
Okay.

1916
01:19:23.026 --> 01:19:24.736
So how do we fix it?
Let's talk solution.


1917
01:19:24.819 --> 01:19:26.488
Well, there's no cure
for what you have.


1918
01:19:26.571 --> 01:19:28.156
Oh, my God!

1919
01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:30.909
I got learning herpes?

1920
01:19:30.992 --> 01:19:32.035
Boy!

1921
01:19:32.118 --> 01:19:33.453
Oh, shit!

1922
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:36.039
There is no such thing
as learning herpes.


1923
01:19:36.122 --> 01:19:37.415
I'm blistering up.

1924
01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.501
It's 'cause
I'm tryin' to think.


1925
01:19:39.584 --> 01:19:41.294
Hey, Teddy!

1926
01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:42.545
TEDDY: Big Mac.

1927
01:19:43.421 --> 01:19:44.690
LUIS: Ringleader.
THERESA: Oh, my gosh!


1928
01:19:44.714 --> 01:19:45.799
Teddy, you're here!

1929
01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:47.675
<i>Hey, Teddy!
What's up, man?</i>


1930
01:19:47.759 --> 01:19:49.469
Teaching the
conventional way


1931
01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:51.554
just isn't gonna
get it done for Teddy.


1932
01:19:51.638 --> 01:19:53.306
So we're gonna mix it up.

1933
01:19:54.015 --> 01:19:55.308
They out here
getting it in.


1934
01:19:56.226 --> 01:19:57.620
What's going on, Carrie?
Why you in here?


1935
01:19:57.644 --> 01:19:59.479
Why you in the ring?
What's going on?


1936
01:19:59.604 --> 01:20:02.690
Teddy, your difficulties are focus-related.
Uh-huh.


1937
01:20:02.774 --> 01:20:05.151
My goal is to remove
that mind chatter


1938
01:20:05.235 --> 01:20:08.363
so you can achieve properly
unencumbered neural pathways.


1939
01:20:08.446 --> 01:20:09.948
And this isn't a ring.

1940
01:20:10.031 --> 01:20:11.282
It's a hexagon.

1941
01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:14.119
Oh, it is. Yeah.

1942
01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:15.846
Why are you taking
your shoes off?


1943
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:16.913
Is this somebody's carpet?

1944
01:20:16.996 --> 01:20:19.249
Teddy, what's the square
root of 81?


1945
01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:20.917
What?

1946
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.043
Ow!

1947
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:24.671
Shit!

1948
01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:25.964
What's the square
root of 81?


1949
01:20:26.047 --> 01:20:27.090
I don't know!

1950
01:20:27.173 --> 01:20:28.258
What you doing?

1951
01:20:28.967 --> 01:20:30.277
Carrie!
What's the square root of 81?


1952
01:20:30.301 --> 01:20:31.386
You breaking my arm!

1953
01:20:31.469 --> 01:20:32.947
Come on, we're clearing
those neural pathways.


1954
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:34.013
No!
Stop it!


1955
01:20:34.097 --> 01:20:35.348
Hey! What you doing?

1956
01:20:35.723 --> 01:20:37.058
Focus!

1957
01:20:37.142 --> 01:20:39.018
Square root! Focus!

1958
01:20:39.185 --> 01:20:41.437
I don't know! Oh, God!
(BONES CRACK)


1959
01:20:43.106 --> 01:20:45.817
Concentrate. Teddy,
concentrate.


1960
01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.443
Come on, Teddy. Come on.

1961
01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.783
How you feelin' today, Teddy?

1962
01:20:53.867 --> 01:20:56.286
I'm feeling
fine, Carrie,


1963
01:20:56.369 --> 01:20:59.247
but I ain't feelin' this
Mr. Miyagi shit. Okay?


1964
01:20:59.414 --> 01:21:00.790
What's the capital of Belgium?

1965
01:21:01.249 --> 01:21:02.292
Uh...

1966
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:03.710
Waffles?

1967
01:21:03.793 --> 01:21:05.086
What?
Run!


1968
01:21:05.879 --> 01:21:07.338
Don't you run from me!

1969
01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:08.464
Don't! He's so little!

1970
01:21:09.174 --> 01:21:11.301
Jesus! What is the
capital of Belgium?


1971
01:21:11.384 --> 01:21:13.261
I haven't eaten

01:27:38.312 --> 01:27:39.814
That's my woman!

2128
01:27:40.273 --> 01:27:41.941
TEDDY: That's not for
kids, Theresa!


2129
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:43.484
JAYLEN: Go, T!

<i>Take me down, no way</i>

2142
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.492
Wait, sweetheart,
who's watching the kids?


2143
01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:35.036
I got it covered.

2144
01:28:35.661 --> 01:28:38.331
<i>She said, "I wanna be
a flight attendant."</i>


2145
01:28:38.497 --> 01:28:39.540
<i>You see?</i>

2146
01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:42.701
<i>"I wanna go from place to place.

<i>Is y'all little bitches
listening?</i>


2148
01:28:50.217 --> 01:28:52.219
You know, Carrie,
you are incredible.


2149
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:54.055
I'm serious.

2150
01:28:54.221 --> 01:28:56.941
There's never been a teacher that
believed in me the way that you do.


2151
01:28:56.974 --> 01:28:58.726
Teddy, what can I say?

2152
01:28:58.893 --> 01:29:02.063
You've grown so much in such
a short period of time.


2153
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:05.024
And if you keep up with all the
stuff that we've been doing,


2154
01:29:05.191 --> 01:29:06.901
you are well on your way.

2155
01:29:07.902 --> 01:29:09.278
I'm just...

2156
01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:11.489
I'm really,
really proud of you.


2157
01:29:18.204 --> 01:29:19.622
You know, Carrie,

2158
01:29:20.998 --> 01:29:23.125
these past few weeks
have been amazing.


2159
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:27.546
I mean, our chemistry,
it goes without saying, it's strong.


2160
01:29:27.713 --> 01:29:29.632
I sense it.
I know you do, too.


2161
01:29:29.715 --> 01:29:32.677
But as magical as these moments
that we've been having may be...


2162
01:29:32.843 --> 01:29:34.095
Fool, I'm gay.

2163
01:29:34.178 --> 01:29:35.638
I'm not tryin' to play.

2164
01:29:35.721 --> 01:29:37.161
Now, I'm not sayin'
I ain't no freak.


2165
01:29:37.223 --> 01:29:38.391
'Cause I'd drop it
off on you.


2166
01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:39.684
I'm a lesbian.

2167
01:29:39.767 --> 01:29:42.561
If you wanna pursue acting,
you can.


2168
01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:43.896
No, I'm gay.

2169
01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:45.582
Say that again. It sound like
you said you're gay.


2170
01:29:45.606 --> 01:29:46.857
I'm gay.

2171
01:29:46.941 --> 01:29:48.567
I like women.

2172
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:50.695
Are you sure?

2173
01:29:50.778 --> 01:29:52.005
Because I'm getting
a whole different vibe.


2174
01:29:52.029 --> 01:29:53.389
LISA: Oh, hell no!
I'm pretty sure.


2175
01:29:53.489 --> 01:29:54.699
Oh, God.

2176
01:29:57.118 --> 01:29:58.202
Teddy?

2177
01:29:58.744 --> 01:30:01.372
Is the one on the left
your type?


2178
01:30:01.455 --> 01:30:03.916
Uh-uh. The one in the tight dress is.
Shit, that's mine.


2179
01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:07.044
Hey!

2180
01:30:07.211 --> 01:30:08.337
There they go.

2181
01:30:08.838 --> 01:30:10.381
What are you doin' here?

2182
01:30:11.132 --> 01:30:12.174
Huh?

2183
01:30:12.258 --> 01:30:14.135
What are you doing
at a high school prom?


2184
01:30:15.553 --> 01:30:17.054
What are you
doin' here, babe?


2185
01:30:17.138 --> 01:30:18.222
Why you here?

2186
01:30:19.306 --> 01:30:22.309
Principal Patowsky is interested
in us redesigning the school


2187
01:30:22.476 --> 01:30:24.236
so he asked us to stop by...
Oh, he did, huh?


2188
01:30:24.395 --> 01:30:25.438
Yeah.

2189
01:30:25.604 --> 01:30:27.273
Well played, Stewart.

2190
01:30:27.982 --> 01:30:29.442
You two know each other?

2191
01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:31.360
Ask Stewart.

2192
01:30:31.819 --> 01:30:33.446
Yes, we went to
high school together.


2193
01:30:33.612 --> 01:30:35.614
I think I mentioned that
at our first meeting.


2194
01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:36.782
No.

2195
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.868
No, you didn't.

2196
01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:42.204
Teddy, I am so confused.

2197
01:30:42.288 --> 01:30:43.664
Why are you here?

2198
01:30:43.748 --> 01:30:44.915
And who is she?

2199
01:30:44.999 --> 01:30:46.751
I can explain.
It ain't what it look like.


2200
01:30:46.834 --> 01:30:48.669
I'm in here with
a bunch of kids,


2201
01:30:48.753 --> 01:30:50.212
dressed in street clothes,

2202
01:30:50.379 --> 01:30:52.099
then remember I blew out
the barbecue shack.


2203
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.009
Fire took me out
of that thing.


2204
01:30:55.384 --> 01:30:57.678
And now my
windshield was...


2205
01:30:57.845 --> 01:30:59.472
What's got me messed
up about the car...


2206
01:30:59.555 --> 01:31:01.098
My brakes ain't workin'

2207
01:31:01.265 --> 01:31:02.892
'cause I backed
into this...


2208
01:31:02.975 --> 01:31:04.143
She gay!

2209
01:31:05.227 --> 01:31:06.854
She ain't even
interested in me.


2210
01:31:07.313 --> 01:31:08.314
So...

2211
01:31:09.607 --> 01:31:11.317
God damn it. Lisa.

2212
01:31:11.484 --> 01:31:12.651
Not now. Not now.
Wait.


2213
01:31:12.735 --> 01:31:13.819
Lisa!

2214
01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.907
Okay, Lisa. Lisa, Lisa.

2215
01:31:18.282 --> 01:31:19.950
Lisa, can you
listen, please?


2216
01:31:20.034 --> 01:31:22.161
Lisa, please, just listen!
What?


2217
01:31:22.578 --> 01:31:23.954
What are you
gonna say, Teddy?


2218
01:31:26.165 --> 01:31:27.958
I'm a high school dropout.

2219
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:30.753
Okay? That woman in there,
Carrie,


2220
01:31:30.836 --> 01:31:32.546
that's my night
school teacher.


2221
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.357
That's what I've been doin'
all these evenings.


2222
01:31:34.381 --> 01:31:36.175
I've been studying to get my GED

2223
01:31:36.342 --> 01:31:38.219
so that I can get
a job at Marvin's.


2224
01:31:39.178 --> 01:31:40.846
So you don't work there now?

2225
01:31:42.807 --> 01:31:44.350
I don't work there yet.

2226
01:31:45.267 --> 01:31:48.854
Right now, I work at a fast food
restaurant called Christian Chicken


2227
01:31:48.938 --> 01:31:51.023
where the chicken is Christian
for some reason.


2228
01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:54.819
Wait, Lisa, let me just say
this before you judge him.


2229
01:31:54.902 --> 01:31:56.320
It ain't that
average chicken.


2230
01:31:56.445 --> 01:31:57.696
It's not the
same fast food


2231
01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:59.925
that you be gettin' from these
other little hood spots.


2232
01:31:59.949 --> 01:32:02.284
It's got the flavor. I don't
know if they use a needle,


2233
01:32:02.368 --> 01:32:04.248
but they get the flavor in deep.
Jaylen, Jaylen!


2234
01:32:05.037 --> 01:32:06.372
How do you know my name?

2235
01:32:06.455 --> 01:32:08.433
My nigga be talking about you
in the class all the time.


2236
01:32:08.457 --> 01:32:10.668
He said you was bad. I didn't
know you was that bad.


2237
01:32:10.751 --> 01:32:11.961
We're Teddy's
classmates.


2238
01:32:12.044 --> 01:32:14.046
I'm Theresa.
That's Jaylen, Mila,


2239
01:32:14.129 --> 01:32:15.673
Mackenzie, and Luis.
Hey.


2240
01:32:16.257 --> 01:32:17.341
You remember me?

2241
01:32:17.424 --> 01:32:20.135
I was actually the waiter
at the restaurant


2242
01:32:20.219 --> 01:32:22.221
when Teddy pulled
all of his pubes


2243
01:32:22.304 --> 01:32:24.723
and he put 'em in the cheesecake
to get out of paying.


2244
01:32:25.224 --> 01:32:27.017
Now, we're best friends.

2245
01:32:28.352 --> 01:32:29.478
(SCOFFS)

2246
01:32:29.562 --> 01:32:31.397
Thank you for your honesty.

2247
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.441
Honesty.

2248
01:32:35.067 --> 01:32:36.443
I know

2249
01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:39.446
that this is
a lot to take in.


2250
01:32:39.613 --> 01:32:40.614
Really?

2251
01:32:41.031 --> 01:32:42.867
But if you let me explain...
No.


2252
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:44.618
If you let me explain...
No, Teddy.


2253
01:32:44.702 --> 01:32:45.995
I'm done with
your explanations.


2254
01:32:47.746 --> 01:32:49.456
You lied to me
about everything.


2255
01:32:50.749 --> 01:32:51.876
Why?

2256
01:32:52.501 --> 01:32:53.711
To impress me?

2257
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:55.880
Teddy, I make my own money.

2258
01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:58.024
You think I care about
what kind of car you drive


2259
01:32:58.048 --> 01:32:59.592
or what kind of watch
you have on?


2260
01:33:00.843 --> 01:33:02.136
That's not me.

2261
01:33:02.928 --> 01:33:05.055
If you think that,
then you don't know me.


2262
01:33:05.222 --> 01:33:06.390
That's not true.

2263
01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.760
If you don't know me, then
you couldn't truly love me.


2264
01:33:08.934 --> 01:33:10.311
That's not true, Lisa.

2265
01:33:13.522 --> 01:33:15.274
Don't come back
to the apartment tonight.


2266
01:33:19.069 --> 01:33:21.629
I don't know, maybe you could stay
with your night school friend.


2267
01:33:24.408 --> 01:33:26.076
Maybe she has
some use for this.


2268
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:29.455
It's probably
fake, right?


2269
01:33:34.084 --> 01:33:36.378
MAYA: Lisa! Lisa... Lisa!

2270
01:33:47.348 --> 01:33:50.100
GLADYS: I cut the crust off.
Just how you like it.


2271
01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.519
Thanks, Ma.

2272
01:33:53.062 --> 01:33:56.649
You're not seriously skipping
that GED test, are you?


2273
01:33:56.857 --> 01:33:57.858
Yeah.

2274
01:33:58.525 --> 01:34:00.694
I mean, I was doing
all that stuff for Lisa.


2275
01:34:01.153 --> 01:34:02.833
If she's not around,
then what's the point?


2276
01:34:02.863 --> 01:34:05.449
My poor baby,
I feel terrible.


2277
01:34:06.283 --> 01:34:08.285
Oh, Gladys, now stop
coddling this boy.


2278
01:34:09.328 --> 01:34:11.747
You know, Theodore,
you're a grown-ass man.


2279
01:34:12.247 --> 01:34:13.707
You need to get
your shit together.


2280
01:34:13.832 --> 01:34:14.959
I know, Dad.

2281
01:34:15.042 --> 01:34:19.505
I mean, you say you got
dyslexia, dyscoglia...


2282
01:34:20.172 --> 01:34:22.341
Dyscalculia.
However you say it.


2283
01:34:22.675 --> 01:34:24.468
The issue is,
you're dishonest.


2284
01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:26.845
I don't blame that girl
for dumping you.


2285
01:34:26.929 --> 01:34:29.056
Now, Gerald,
that is enough.


2286
01:34:32.142 --> 01:34:33.182
You know, maybe you right.

2287
01:34:34.103 --> 01:34:35.145
Maybe I do deserve it.

2288
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:36.313
Ya think?

2289
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:38.816
I was being sarcastic.

2290
01:34:39.817 --> 01:34:41.735
I'll get your bed
ready, baby.


2291
01:34:41.819 --> 01:34:43.028
Would you like a tuck-in?

2292
01:34:43.112 --> 01:34:44.279
Yes, please.

2293
01:34:46.532 --> 01:34:48.200
Thank you, Mom.
Anything for you, darling.


2294
01:34:54.206 --> 01:34:55.499
I failed.

2295
01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.503
I failed as a father.

2296
01:35:00.754 --> 01:35:02.464
A tuck-in?

2297
01:35:05.134 --> 01:35:07.195
(WHISPERS) Oh, my gosh.
Why'd he come on the bus like that?


2298
01:35:07.219 --> 01:35:09.012
I don't know.
He ain't got no friends.


2299
01:35:09.722 --> 01:35:11.223
That's what I think.

2300
01:35:14.143 --> 01:35:15.394
What's the problem?

2301
01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.605
Christian Chicken!

2302
01:35:18.772 --> 01:35:20.399
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

2303
01:35:20.482 --> 01:35:22.484
Honk once if you love chicken!

2304
01:35:22.568 --> 01:35:24.987
Honk twice
if you love the Lord.


2305
01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.574
Come and get your chicken
if you ready to start winning.


2306
01:35:29.366 --> 01:35:31.201
Hey! Sellout!

2307
01:35:31.618 --> 01:35:33.704
What?
You a sellout, man.


2308
01:35:33.787 --> 01:35:35.181
Brother, I'm just tryin'
to make a honest livin'.


2309
01:35:35.205 --> 01:35:36.457
Why don't you
get off my back?


2310
01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.250
Go get a job
at the post office then!


2311
01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:40.213
Get your ass up out of here.
What? Say it again.


2312
01:35:40.252 --> 01:35:42.337
Come on, man!
Go ahead with that.


2313
01:35:42.421 --> 01:35:43.547
Stay woke, bro.

2314
01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:46.216
Yeah, well, I see you ate the
chicken, you son of a bitch.


2315
01:35:49.011 --> 01:35:51.263
So this is what
it's come to, huh?


2316
01:35:53.974 --> 01:35:55.684
You got some nerve, man.

2317
01:35:56.143 --> 01:35:57.686
Teddy, look...

2318
01:35:59.021 --> 01:36:01.815
I came here to apologize.

2319
01:36:02.357 --> 01:36:03.859
I'm on my break.

2320
01:36:04.026 --> 01:36:06.004
I ain't got time for this.
Teddy, please, just listen.


2321
01:36:06.028 --> 01:36:07.547
I don't wanna hear nothin'
you got to say, man.


2322
01:36:07.571 --> 01:36:08.673
No. Please,
just listen to me.


2323
01:36:08.697 --> 01:36:09.758
I don't have nothin'
to say to you!


2324
01:36:09.782 --> 01:36:11.825
I have something to say to you, okay?
What? What?


2325
01:36:11.909 --> 01:36:14.369
Give me 30 seconds, okay?

2326
01:36:14.536 --> 01:36:17.664
Listen, when we were in high school,
you had everything that I wanted.


2327
01:36:17.748 --> 01:36:19.208
You got 28 seconds left.

2328
01:36:19.291 --> 01:36:20.542
I had grades.
That's all I had.


2329
01:36:20.626 --> 01:36:24.129
You had sports,
friends, girls.


2330
01:36:24.213 --> 01:36:25.923
I sucked at all that.

2331
01:36:26.006 --> 01:36:28.091
I was 27 when I got
my first hand job.


2332
01:36:28.634 --> 01:36:32.012
You're at one, but before I walk
away, I wanna tell you that's sad.


2333
01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:34.431
That's my point. I don't care!
Why you telling me?


2334
01:36:34.515 --> 01:36:36.995
My point is, I was a late bloomer,
and I was desperate and sad.


2335
01:36:37.059 --> 01:36:38.143
And I blamed you.

2336
01:36:38.977 --> 01:36:41.897
And the other night,
when I got my revenge,


2337
01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:43.398
it felt awful.

2338
01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:48.111
I got into education to make a difference
in people's lives, not to ruin them.


2339
01:36:49.279 --> 01:36:50.489
Also,

2340
01:36:50.656 --> 01:36:54.368
I told Stewart here I'd beat his ass
if he didn't come and apologize.


2341
01:36:54.451 --> 01:36:57.412
That is true. That was a part of
it. A small part.


2342
01:36:57.496 --> 01:36:58.872
Okay, you know
what, guys?


2343
01:36:58.956 --> 01:37:02.543
I appreciate the whole "after
school special" moment.


2344
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:04.837
But understand
that I am okay.


2345
01:37:05.003 --> 01:37:07.464
I am where I'm supposed to be.
All right?


2346
01:37:07.548 --> 01:37:10.342
Your destiny is to work at a fast
food joint next to a strip club?


2347
01:37:10.425 --> 01:37:11.677
Yes. All right?

2348
01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.929
If I stand in the right spot
in this parking lot,


2349
01:37:14.012 --> 01:37:17.349
I can smell cocoa butter and
fried chicken at the same time.


2350
01:37:17.641 --> 01:37:19.786
And I don't know about you guys,
but that's a win for me.


2351
01:37:19.810 --> 01:37:22.271
Teddy, listen to me.
Ain't no "Teddy, listen."


2352
01:37:22.396 --> 01:37:23.939
You know I wasn't
gonna pass that test,


2353
01:37:24.022 --> 01:37:26.900
so don't sit here and act like it
was gonna be a different story.


2354
01:37:26.984 --> 01:37:29.796
And don't act like you don't wanna be
able to finally say that I'm dumb.


2355
01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:30.863
No, you're not.

2356
01:37:30.946 --> 01:37:32.906
You can finally say it, Stew.
Say it!


2357
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:34.283
Teddy.

2358
01:37:35.409 --> 01:37:37.452
You are a lot of things.

2359
01:37:37.619 --> 01:37:40.163
A hustler, a liar.

2360
01:37:40.497 --> 01:37:41.665
You're very short.

2361
01:37:41.832 --> 01:37:43.041
Mad loud, too.

2362
01:37:43.125 --> 01:37:44.251
Mmm-hmm.

2363
01:37:44.418 --> 01:37:46.587
But you are not dumb!

2364
01:37:47.004 --> 01:37:49.882
Now, this suit you got
on is dumb as hell.


2365
01:37:50.048 --> 01:37:52.175
I rebuke you! Rebuke!

2366
01:37:52.342 --> 01:37:54.386
I rebuke you!
I'm going to work.


2367
01:37:54.511 --> 01:37:55.822
Now, let me go get...
Give me this thing.


2368
01:37:55.846 --> 01:37:57.282
What you doing, Carrie?
Take this off right now.


2369
01:37:57.306 --> 01:37:59.033
Take this suit off,
and you gonna take this test!


2370
01:37:59.057 --> 01:38:00.058
No, no, no.

2371
01:38:00.142 --> 01:38:01.494
No, let's use our words.
You gonna take this test!


2372
01:38:01.518 --> 01:38:02.662
All right, come here.
You know what?


2373
01:38:02.686 --> 01:38:03.872
What you doin'?
She has a belt!


2374
01:38:03.896 --> 01:38:04.980
She's got a belt!

2375
01:38:05.063 --> 01:38:06.481
Take this suit off,

2376
01:38:06.565 --> 01:38:07.834
and you gonna take that test!
Guys, guys, guys!


2377
01:38:07.858 --> 01:38:08.918
We need to keep our hands to ourselves.
You stop!


2378
01:38:08.942 --> 01:38:10.003
You stop!
Get off me! Dang it!


2379
01:38:10.027 --> 01:38:11.337
This gonna hurt me more
than it's gonna hurt you!


2380
01:38:11.361 --> 01:38:13.530
Oh, God! I can't be
a part of this.


2381
01:38:13.614 --> 01:38:15.866
You're breaking the skin!
Tear your ass up.


2382
01:38:16.074 --> 01:38:17.492
Okay, this seems
like a black thing.


2383
01:38:17.576 --> 01:38:19.161
So I'm just gonna
order us some food.


2384
01:38:19.244 --> 01:38:20.370
All right!
Now, listen to me!


2385
01:38:20.454 --> 01:38:21.598
All right!
Are you listening to me?


2386
01:38:21.622 --> 01:38:22.664
Yes!

2387
01:38:22.748 --> 01:38:24.124
Now, you have
worked too hard


2388
01:38:24.207 --> 01:38:27.294
to be running around here
in a damn holy chicken suit.


2389
01:38:27.586 --> 01:38:29.046
Okay?
Yes.


2390
01:38:29.212 --> 01:38:31.214
Now, either you
get in the car


2391
01:38:31.632 --> 01:38:33.592
and you take that test,

2392
01:38:33.884 --> 01:38:36.887
or I continue to
tenderize your ass.


2393
01:38:37.054 --> 01:38:38.472
Your choice.

2394
01:38:42.684 --> 01:38:45.020
Are you ready?
Good luck, guys.


2395
01:38:45.812 --> 01:38:47.397
Yeah.
I'm back.


2396
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:49.191
Hey, Carrie.

2397
01:38:57.282 --> 01:38:58.951
MAC: Teddy!
MILA: Teddy's back!


2398

What's up, Ted?</i>


2399
01:39:00.953 --> 01:39:03.163
THERESA: Hey, Teddy!
MAC: Teddy! Teddy!


2400
01:39:03.288 --> 01:39:04.373
Yes!

2401
01:39:05.207 --> 01:39:07.542
What up, king?
Come on, man!


2402
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.628
Let's do this.

2403
01:39:09.711 --> 01:39:11.129
LUIS: A hero returns.

2404
01:39:14.174 --> 01:39:16.301
CARRIE: Okay, we're complete.

2405
01:39:16.468 --> 01:39:20.514
So let's turn on those
computers and ace this thing!


2406
01:39:20.597 --> 01:39:21.640
Go!

2407
01:39:23.225 --> 01:39:24.935
Okay, robot.

2408
01:39:25.435 --> 01:39:27.771
You bowing down
to a god today.


2409
01:39:32.651 --> 01:39:34.277
Good luck, everybody.

2410
01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:38.907
(GRUNTING)

2411
01:39:54.089 --> 01:39:55.632
Come on, Teddy.

2412
01:40:01.722 --> 01:40:02.848
CARRIE: <i>Focus.</i>

2413

<i>Concentrate. Get rid of that
mind chatter.</i>


2414
01:40:07.019 --> 01:40:08.353
Come on, focus!

2415
01:40:08.437 --> 01:40:10.355
Focus!
Oh, God!


2416
01:40:10.439 --> 01:40:12.524
Focus. You better
get it right!


2417
01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:14.401
Focus! Focus!

2418
01:40:42.054 --> 01:40:43.055
Yeah!

2419
01:40:45.057 --> 01:40:46.183
Shh.

2420
01:40:49.853 --> 01:40:52.481
Okay, everybody, calm
down. All right?


2421
01:40:52.564 --> 01:40:54.608
The results will be in
online in just a minute.


2422
01:40:54.691 --> 01:40:56.777
If you get over 145,
you pass.


2423
01:40:56.943 --> 01:40:58.070
TEDDY: She's right.

2424
01:40:58.153 --> 01:41:00.131
All right, you do the hard work,
you get rewarded for it.


2425
01:41:00.155 --> 01:41:01.382
No need to panic.
(DEVICE CHIMES)


2426
01:41:01.406 --> 01:41:03.116
Hey, hey, hey!
The results just came in.


2427
01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.826
Oh, shit!
MAC: Oh, my gosh!


2428
01:41:05.744 --> 01:41:07.871
I passed! I got a 146!

2429
01:41:08.038 --> 01:41:10.207
146, Mac! Yeah!

2430
01:41:10.373 --> 01:41:11.625
Way to go.
MAC: Yes, yes!


2431
01:41:11.708 --> 01:41:13.043
Management,
here I come, baby!


2432

I'm Teddy Walker,
and I'm a liar.

For years, I've been pretending
to be somebody else.

Somebody that I'm not.

2542
01:45:57.369 --> 01:45:59.788
My reason for doing that is
because I was ashamed.

Ashamed that I didn't learn
like my classmates.

went into learning in school.

never had you."

"Oh, God, if I could get that one back."
I remember you said that.

was said out of love
