00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:57.495
I'm turning
Barbecue City


159
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.790
over to you.

160
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.625
Excuse me?

161
00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:04.293
What?

162
00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:06.087
Don't shit me.

163
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.255
I'm serious!

164
00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:10.258
Oh, my God, Joe!
I just got goose bumps!


165
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.635
Yes.
I got goose bumps all over!


166
00:08:12.718 --> 00:08:14.318
I don't know what to say, man!
Thank you!


167
00:08:14.553 --> 00:08:17.390
No, thank you, son.

168
00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:20.351
Whatchu talkin' bout, Joe?
(LAUGHING)


169
00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:22.853
You better come here,
Mr. Drummond.


170
00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:25.940
All yours, Teddy.

171
00:08:27.483 --> 00:08:28.901
What do you think?
Oh...


172
00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:30.486
It's amazing.

173
00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:31.570
Really?
Yeah.


174
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:33.781
But as your unofficial
financial adviser,


175
00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:37.285
I'm obligated to tell you that this
ring is way out of your budget.


176
00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:38.536
Relax.

177
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:40.413
Lisa's cool as hell.
She knows who you are.


178
00:08:40.496 --> 00:08:42.415
Lisa does not
know who I am.


179
00:08:42.498 --> 00:08:45.209
Lisa knows that I'm a
successful barbecue salesman.


180
00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:47.670
Marvin knows that Teddy's
a high school dropout


181
00:08:47.753 --> 00:08:49.088
who's living paycheck
to paycheck


182
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:51.149
'cause I'm with a woman that's
way above my weight class.


183
00:08:51.173 --> 00:08:54.010
Your life is built on
a financial house of cards.


184
00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:55.886
Stop it.
The Porsche, the duplex.


185
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.346
What are you
trying to prove?


186
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.474
Plus, every single time we go out,
she offers to pay for the check.


187
00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:02.286
The day that I let her
put down her plastic


188
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.477
is the day
that I lose her.


189
00:09:03.686 --> 00:09:05.539
And you know that. I don't
know why I was so nervous.


190
00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:06.564
It's come together.

191
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:07.815
Hey.
Hi.


192
00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:08.899
Lisa.

193
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:10.276
Hi.

194
00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:13.362
Dude, Lisa's the best thing
that ever happened to me.


195
00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:15.323
I don't wanna
mess this one up, man.


196
00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:16.699
(ALL LAUGHING)

197
00:09:16.782 --> 00:09:17.950
I told them.
He did.


198
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:20.328
He actually said that.
MARVIN: Ooh!


199
00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:21.912
Some dessert.
That looks amazing.


200
00:09:22.163 --> 00:09:23.456
Wow. Thank you.
Wow.


201
00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:26.417
Chef Clemont also said that
there will be no check.


202
00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:28.669
This is all on him.

203
00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:29.879
Wow.

204
00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:31.005
I knew he would try this.

205
00:09:31.088 --> 00:09:33.758
You know what? Tell him I appreciate
it, but I insist on paying.


206
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:35.343
Okay.
Okay, well, just wait.


207
00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:37.094
Well, hold on
now, honey.


208
00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:39.740
Honey, you don't want to offend him.
You're his guest, right?


209
00:09:39.764 --> 00:09:41.366
Trust me, you never take
a free meal from a client.


210
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.659
That way, you don't
owe them anything.


211
00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:43.683
That's true.

212
00:09:43.768 --> 00:09:45.608
Thank you, Lisa. Appreciate it.
LISA: You know.


213
00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:47.855
Whenever you're ready.
LISA: Thank you.


214
00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:50.917
You know what then, baby?
If that's the case, then let me...


215
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:54.111
No. Baby, this is my thing.
There's, like, eight of us. I got it.


216
00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:55.988
You can probably
write it off, right? Yes.


217
00:09:56.238 --> 00:09:58.574
I didn't think about that.
It is a business expense. Okay.


218
00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.785
Come on.
MAYA: Wait, wait. Hold up, Lis.


219
00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.162
It is a business
expense, but, Lis,


220
00:10:03.245 --> 00:10:05.331
it's clear that Teddy
really wants to treat.


221
00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:09.126
We're out here celebrating you.
Let him.


222
00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:12.088
Right, Teddy?

223
00:10:12.922 --> 00:10:14.757
Yes.
Wow.


224
00:10:14.924 --> 00:10:16.008
Yes.

225
00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:18.719
Why aren't we closer?
'Cause you get me.


226
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:20.262
I have it. I got it.

227
00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:21.597
I love you.
Love you back.


228
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:23.933
Black love.
TEDDY: Okay.


229
00:10:24.308 --> 00:10:25.851
Oh, shit.

230
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.687
All right, Marvin. Hit me.
Thank you.


231
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:30.749
It's so good. LISA: One of my
favorite things that he does.


232
00:10:30.773 --> 00:10:32.959
That caramel tart, he's known for it.
TEDDY: (EXHALES) All right.


233
00:10:32.983 --> 00:10:36.070
Oh, I gotta get in that.
Definitely gonna try that.


234
00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:38.072
Mmm-mmm.
MAYA: So amazing.


235
00:10:38.155 --> 00:10:39.800
LISA: Aren't these beautiful?
He did these just for us.


236
00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:41.802
MAYA: Did he?
LISA: Yeah. You should try this caramel.


237
00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:44.036
I'm gonna take a little bit of it.
Get in there.


238
00:10:44.453 --> 00:10:46.122
Take me through.
Lisa, take me through.


239
00:10:46.205 --> 00:10:48.082
So this is a chair.
Straight up, it's a chair.


240
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.625
I know that much.

241
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.061
Give me the <i>Behind the
Music</i> about the chair.


242
00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:52.437
Pretend I'm on VH1
or something like that.


243
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.398
Well, actually, these chairs
have a very interesting story.


244
00:10:54.422 --> 00:10:57.007
They're from Denmark. Found them
in a warehouse. MARVIN: Whoa...


245
00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:00.428
Mid-century, modern,
kind of rounded.


246
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.906
MARVIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know it's blue and stuff like that.


247
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.324
LISA: I didn't know you were so
into chairs. (GROANS SOFTLY)


248
00:11:04.348 --> 00:11:05.391
You would not believe.

249
00:11:05.474 --> 00:11:07.285
I'll go home, I'll look at my chair,
I get turned on in a second.


250
00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:08.829
It's just a weird fetish of mine.
LISA: You would love these.


251
00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:11.164
Because I don't know if you noticed
the cerulean kind of undertone


252
00:11:11.188 --> 00:11:14.400
of the wallpaper, but we kind of
wanted to tie it all together


253
00:11:14.483 --> 00:11:16.777
to kind of offset the harder,
more straighter lines.


254
00:11:17.528 --> 00:11:18.946
What is that?

255
00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:21.740
Oh, my God.

256
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.742
Oh, my God!

257
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:25.202
(SPOON CLATTERING)

258
00:11:25.286 --> 00:11:26.662
No, no, no!

259
00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:28.557
LISA: What? Is there a problem
with the dessert, sir?


260
00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:30.124
I think that's pubic hair
in the cake.


261
00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:31.643
MARVIN: Oh, my God.
LISA: Oh, my gosh.


262
00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:33.586
Is this pubic hair
in my damn dessert?


263
00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:34.837
May I?

264
00:11:36.422 --> 00:11:38.215
I'm sorry, what?
May I please take it?


265
00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:39.779
Literally, I'm telling you
what it is.


266
00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:40.926
Uh...

267
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.226
This is way too many pubes.

268
00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:51.270
What does that mean?

269
00:11:51.353 --> 00:11:53.731
I mean, one is too many pubes.
If you could tell the chef.


270
00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.667
Thank you. Thank you for
taking care of this for us.


271
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:57.234
I believe you planted these.

272
00:11:58.444 --> 00:11:59.671
No, no, no.
What did you just say?


273
00:11:59.695 --> 00:12:01.780
MARVIN: Stop. I got this.
Now, that's insane of you.


274
00:12:01.864 --> 00:12:04.658
I've known this man my entire life.
He's not a pube planter, sir.


275
00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:06.118
No, no, stop, Marv. Stop.

276
00:12:06.202 --> 00:12:07.369
Maybe you planted them.

277
00:12:07.453 --> 00:12:08.746
What?
Boom.


278
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:10.098
I risked my life
coming to this country


279
00:12:10.122 --> 00:12:12.416
so I can plant pubes on some
random guy's cheesecake?


280
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.860
I don't know
what you're into, man.


281
00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:16.879
And I have a flash of news for you, guy.
I manscape down here.


282
00:12:16.962 --> 00:12:20.257
Okay. That's my woman,
and that's too much information.


283
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:24.345
And these are the pubes of
an African-American guy.


284
00:12:24.428 --> 00:12:26.388
MARVIN: Oh, shit.
What? That's racist, man.


285
00:12:26.472 --> 00:12:28.265
It's descriptive.

286
00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:29.892
Descriptive, my ass.
That's racist.


287
00:12:29.975 --> 00:12:32.603
Luis. That's what they are.
Afro-pubes.


288
00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.831
Friends, friends, what is happening?
What is happening?


289
00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:35.981
Pubes and racism.

290
00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:37.107
TEDDY: Chef Clemont...

291
00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:38.984
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

292
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.671
(IN ENGLISH) All right? I go to
take a bite of my cheesecake,


293
00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:43.989
there's what appears to be
pubic hair in my cake.


294
00:12:44.073 --> 00:12:47.618
That he planted with his
African-American short and curly pubes.


295
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:50.305
Say African-American again,
and I'mma get dark and curly in your ass!


296
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:52.289
I will say it again!
Say it again!


297
00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:54.267
LUIS: You want to dance?
'Cause I'll boogie-woogie.


298
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:56.669
Please, everyone calm down.
I am mortified by this.


299
00:12:56.752 --> 00:12:58.170
I am so sorry, everyone.

300
00:12:58.837 --> 00:12:59.964
The meal is on me.

301
00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:01.927
No. This is what he wants.
Thank you, thank you.


302
00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:03.401
Luis, I need to speak
to you in the kitchen. (SLAMS SPOON)


303
00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:04.468
Go in the kitchen, man.

304
00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:05.678
You're going to die.

305
00:13:06.136 --> 00:13:07.572
Luis, I need to speak to you
in the kitchen.


306
00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:09.306
You messed with the wrong guy.

307
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.808
Luis, right now.

did we, Teddy?</i>

YOUNG TEDDY: <i>Stewart,
what is your problem with me?</i>

My problem
with you, Teddy,


462
00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:34.208
is that students like you bring down
the reputation of this high school.

(MOCKING)

464
00:19:35.442 --> 00:19:37.402
You may have everybody else
at this school fooled,


465
00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:38.921
but I know you're actually
covering up


466
00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:40.965
for the fact that you're
really just not that smart.


467
00:19:40.989 --> 00:19:43.867
In fact, you might be the
dumbest student at this school.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

I don't know the first thing
about teaching biology.

STEWART: Oh, for God's sakes!

472
00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:06.014
What part of "There is no musical
program" do you not understand, Trish?


473
00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:09.309
Nobody's getting into Ivy League
schools on a bassoon scholarship.

I'm not book smart.</i>


476
00:20:11.603 --> 00:20:14.815
Stewart's smarter than me.
But you know what I'm not?


477
00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:16.650
I'm not a freak
of nature, Stew.


478
00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:17.818
Uh-oh, Stew.

479
00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:19.319
Don't do this, Teddy.

480

Hey, quick question,
everybody.


481

Has anybody here ever seen
Stewart with his shirt off?

It's a birthmark!
It's a birthmark!

If it's a birthmark,
let us see it right now.


484
00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:30.497
Prove it! You all wanna
see my birthmark?

You got a pig's butthole
on your chest, man.

There's no hole in it,
so how could it be a butthole?

didn't we?

we laughed.

(LAUGHING AWKWARDLY)

498
00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:12.205
So, how long you been
the principal, man?


499
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:13.457

Wow.
Yeah.

Wasn't easy, but cleaned this place
up using my brain and my bat.


502
00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:21.524
As opposed to when
we went to high school,


503
00:21:21.548 --> 00:21:24.217
now if you have a D average,
you're out.


504

Can you do that?

I can do whatever
I want, Teddy.

This my house.

507
00:21:31.433 --> 00:21:32.744
I'm sorry.
What was the last part?


508
00:21:32.768 --> 00:21:33.935
I said look around you.

This is my house.

Excuse me for asking, but are
you doing a black voice?


511
00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:46.865
No. No. Not a black voice.

You sure?
I don't hear color.

Mmm. What brings you back
to Piedmont, Mr. Walker?

to a job in finance.

516
00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:58.502
And the only thing that's really
holding up this transition


517
00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:01.213
is me not having my GED.

518
00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:03.089
So, I don't know,
I was thinking


519
00:22:03.173 --> 00:22:05.300
maybe I could get you to cross
some T's, dot some I's.

I wish I could. I really do.

527
00:22:22.943 --> 00:22:24.945
But you would have to go
to night school


528
00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:26.947
to learn how to pass
the GED test


529
00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:30.158
and unfortunately, we don't
offer night school here.

Why did you add AP Calculus
to my class load?

00:23:29.509 --> 00:23:32.012
Knowing good and well I already
have five units to teach

It's too much!

the night school teacher?

Wait. Hold up!

00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:47.962
Stewart, why did you just tell me that
you don't have night school here?


559
00:23:47.986 --> 00:23:49.154
Why would you say that?

560
00:23:49.237 --> 00:23:52.657
I said that because Teddy and
I went to school together.


561
00:23:52.741 --> 00:23:55.702
He is quite frankly
a terrible student


562
00:23:55.785 --> 00:23:57.746
and I did not want that
element in here.

That was a poor
choice of words.

I just mean, I need you
to show me the respect

that you would
show your boss.

It's not a black voice.
In actuality, not a black voice.

No, you do a black voice.

you was in that meeting?

You was like, "We gonna get it lit
up in here. This meeting lit."

00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:32.739
It was very lit.

581
00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:34.592
You did it at
the staff meeting,


582
00:24:34.616 --> 00:24:36.368
when you were like,
"I keep it 100."


583
00:24:36.451 --> 00:24:37.827
When have I never
kept it 100?

Calculus to my class load.

here's a textbook.

No, I didn't think that.

Go to the library then.

we got married after he knocked
me up, then we had two more kids.

00:32:36.139 --> 00:32:38.349
So here I am.
I'm so psyched.


761
00:32:38.432 --> 00:32:39.559
Cool!

762
00:32:39.642 --> 00:32:42.687
Look at you, all cute,
making America great again.


763
00:32:43.104 --> 00:32:44.147
Bitch.

764
00:32:45.189 --> 00:32:46.816
So what's your
story, guy?


765
00:32:47.024 --> 00:32:51.112
My name is Luis Flores.
I had a great job as a waiter.


766
00:32:51.195 --> 00:32:53.072
A lot of money in tips

767
00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:55.825
until I was fired
without cause.


768
00:32:56.409 --> 00:32:57.535
No reason at all.

769
00:32:57.618 --> 00:32:58.870
Fired.

770
00:33:01.038 --> 00:33:03.749
I don't know why.
I have no idea why he's lookin' at me.


771
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:05.251
It's fine.

772
00:33:05.334 --> 00:33:08.004
It's just a sign that it's time
for me to do something different.


773
00:33:08.462 --> 00:33:10.715
You see, I came to this
country from Mexico


774
00:33:10.798 --> 00:33:12.693
to fulfill my dream of
being a singer-songwriter.


775
00:33:12.717 --> 00:33:14.302
Oh, like Julio Iglesias?

776
00:33:14.385 --> 00:33:16.888
No, not like Julio Iglesias.

777
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.514
He sucks.

778
00:33:19.473 --> 00:33:23.102
More like Justin Bieber
or Justin Timberlake.


779
00:33:23.186 --> 00:33:24.353
Or T
-Pain.

780
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:25.980
(LAUGHING)

781
00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:27.690
MILA: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

782
00:33:27.773 --> 00:33:30.693
Aren't you a little old
to be a pop star now?


783
00:33:30.776 --> 00:33:32.320
Aren't you a little
young to die?


784
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.323
That's what's up.

785
00:33:36.324 --> 00:33:39.911
But now I'm going to become
a dental hygienist.


786
00:33:40.828 --> 00:33:42.121
'Cause I have great teeth.

787
00:33:43.331 --> 00:33:44.790
So I think I'd be a natural.

788
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:48.169
A what?
Dental hygienist.


789
00:33:49.879 --> 00:33:51.047
Maybe you should see one.

790
00:33:51.714 --> 00:33:54.467
'Cause you know what?
Pretty stinky, guys.


791
00:33:54.884 --> 00:33:56.928
All right! Hey, everybody,
I'm Mackenzie.


792
00:33:57.637 --> 00:33:58.679
They call me Big Mac.

793
00:33:58.804 --> 00:34:00.431
Oh. We love McDonald's.

794
00:34:01.182 --> 00:34:03.976
What?
McDonald's?


795
00:34:04.435 --> 00:34:05.436
I'm sorry, what?

796
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.521
From the burger joint,
Mickey D's?


797
00:34:08.814 --> 00:34:10.316
Ronald McDonald's?

798
00:34:11.651 --> 00:34:14.278
Two all-beef patties,
special sauce, lettuce, cheese


799
00:34:14.612 --> 00:34:16.405
on a sesame seed bun?
Hmm...


800
00:34:16.906 --> 00:34:18.115
Never heard of it?

801
00:34:19.075 --> 00:34:20.451
Uh...

802
00:34:21.911 --> 00:34:24.789
Ooh.
It's gonna be a long semester.


803
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:26.582
Go on.

804
00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:31.254
Well, anyway, my knees and
my back are really jacked up


805
00:34:31.337 --> 00:34:33.923
from working at He-Man
Movers for 30 years.


806
00:34:34.006 --> 00:34:36.759
So I decided to get my GED

807
00:34:36.842 --> 00:34:39.095
so that I could move up
to a management position.


808
00:34:39.178 --> 00:34:40.429
Get off the truck.

809
00:34:40.513 --> 00:34:44.600
And my son, we call him Little Mac,
he has decided to drop out of school.


810
00:34:44.684 --> 00:34:45.935
So I made
a deal with him.


811
00:34:46.018 --> 00:34:48.980
I get my GED,
he gets his diploma.


812
00:34:50.314 --> 00:34:52.066
Little reverse psychology!

813
00:34:52.817 --> 00:34:53.859
All right.

814
00:34:54.443 --> 00:34:55.695
And what's your name?

815
00:34:55.778 --> 00:34:57.154
<i>Hey, yo, what up? 
I'm Bobby.</i>

816
00:34:57.238 --> 00:34:58.990
That's what
I'm talking about.


817
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.784
That's Illuminati!
That's what I'm saying!


818
00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:03.661
See, the nigga here,
but he ain't here!


819
00:35:03.744 --> 00:35:07.123
It's like they watchin' you and
you think you watchin' them!


820
00:35:07.206 --> 00:35:09.834
That's what they do!
So you got Bobby Digital.


821
00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:11.711
He here, but he not.

822
00:35:11.794 --> 00:35:14.171
That's Tupac Coachella.
You know what I'm saying?


823
00:35:15.047 --> 00:35:16.841
You see? Y'all don't...

824
00:35:16.924 --> 00:35:18.301
All right.

825
00:35:18.384 --> 00:35:20.344
That probably ain't even
a real nigga. Hey.


826
00:35:20.428 --> 00:35:22.555
Are you on crack? It's Skype.

827
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:28.185
(SCOFFS) Ooh, boy, it's hard to be woke.
It's hard to be woke.


828
00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:31.564
What is "woke"?

829
00:35:31.647 --> 00:35:34.400
Okay, well,
welcome, everyone.


830
00:35:34.483 --> 00:35:36.110
Really nice, we've all met.

831
00:35:36.193 --> 00:35:38.988
We didn't meet everyone.

832
00:35:39.071 --> 00:35:40.156
I didn't...
Teddy.


833
00:35:40.614 --> 00:35:45.286
Earlier, you said, unlike these folks,
you're not a night school type of person.


834
00:35:46.412 --> 00:35:48.331
So I didn't think you cared.

835
00:35:48.414 --> 00:35:50.124
LUIS: Is that right?

836
00:35:51.417 --> 00:35:53.210
You didn't hear it right,

837
00:35:53.294 --> 00:35:56.213
'cause I would never say that
about people that I don't know.


838
00:35:56.297 --> 00:35:58.007
You know what?
This is a perfect segue.


839
00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.926
I'll just follow your lead,
and I'll stand up.


840
00:36:01.135 --> 00:36:02.762
I am Teddy Walker.

841
00:36:02.845 --> 00:36:04.889
A little fun fact about me,
I actually went here.


842
00:36:05.514 --> 00:36:07.475
Oh.
I'm also newly engaged.


843
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.268
His fianc√©e is
out of his league.


844
00:36:09.352 --> 00:36:10.478
I'm sorry, what?

845
00:36:10.561 --> 00:36:14.523
Nothing. You're doing great. I said,
"Keep going. Everybody loves you."


846
00:36:14.982 --> 00:36:17.360
How does your fianc√©e feel about
you being in night school?


847
00:36:17.443 --> 00:36:18.569
She good!

848
00:36:19.779 --> 00:36:20.780
She loves it!

849
00:36:21.405 --> 00:36:22.782
He ain't told her shit.

850
00:36:22.865 --> 00:36:24.033
TEDDY: She loves it!

851
00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:26.994
I noticed that your voice just
went up a whole octave.


852
00:36:27.536 --> 00:36:30.664
Now, from my studies of
psychology in grad school,


853
00:36:30.748 --> 00:36:33.292
I know that that means
that you're bullshitting.


854
00:36:33.376 --> 00:36:34.585
Ain't no bullshit in me.

855
00:36:35.753 --> 00:36:37.856
I tell you what, if you're lying
with her, don't lie to her.


856
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.006
But I don't lie.

857
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.549
<i>Sound like
some bullshit to me.</i>


858
00:36:40.674 --> 00:36:43.010
Everyone sees right through you.
Okay, how about we...


859
00:36:43.094 --> 00:36:45.388
If we go by your theory,
about the voice thing...


860
00:36:45.471 --> 00:36:47.181
I think that we're all
gettin' off track.


861
00:36:47.264 --> 00:36:48.265
He's lied four times.

862
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:50.643
<i>This boy definitely lying.</i>
I am not.


863
00:36:50.726 --> 00:36:53.729
You can't outsmart Mother Nature.
And that's what a woman is.


864
00:36:53.813 --> 00:36:55.439
Brother.
Especially a black woman.


865
00:36:55.523 --> 00:36:56.816
That's correct.

866
00:36:56.899 --> 00:36:58.168
Girls are smart, dude.
MAC: Is she pretty?


867
00:36:58.192 --> 00:36:59.860
God damn it.
Like, literally, damn it.


868
00:36:59.985 --> 00:37:01.797
Even if he didn't tell her, so what?
Okay, here's the thing...


869
00:37:01.821 --> 00:37:04.573
I told Randy that he was the first
guy I slept with. Not true.


870
00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:06.283
I'm trying
to introduce myself...


871
00:37:06.367 --> 00:37:07.910
You don't respect your queen,

872
00:37:07.993 --> 00:37:09.471
'cause if you did, that bitch
would know where you at.


873
00:37:09.495 --> 00:37:12.373
TEDDY: Okay. Teddy. Don't lie
to your queen.


874
00:37:12.456 --> 00:37:13.457
Okay, guys.

875
00:37:13.541 --> 00:37:14.810
If you're busting off
in her guts like that,


876
00:37:14.834 --> 00:37:16.074
she might be
carrying your seed.


877
00:37:16.127 --> 00:37:17.354
I feel like this
conversation's...


878
00:37:17.378 --> 00:37:18.939
So you ain't just lyin' to her.
You lyin' to your child.


879
00:37:18.963 --> 00:37:20.005
Shit!

880
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:22.109
If it's your bottom bitch,
she know you stupid, fam.


881
00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:23.235
All I'm sayin', fam...
Forget it.


882
00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:24.301
Okay!

883
00:37:24.385 --> 00:37:26.679
How your fianc√©e don't know
where you at? It's after dark.


884
00:37:26.762 --> 00:37:28.639
This ain't Halloween, fam.
I'm done.


885
00:37:29.014 --> 00:37:31.392
My sister know
where I'm at. Okay?


886
00:37:31.475 --> 00:37:33.436
And she live all the way
in Arkansas.


887
00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:35.646
Okay, here's the deal, class.

888
00:37:36.564 --> 00:37:40.401
You will be given homework every
night, just like regular high school.


889
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.279
(GROANS)
And now, a pop quiz


890
00:37:43.362 --> 00:37:46.782
just so I can get a better
idea of where you all are.


891
00:37:46.907 --> 00:37:48.909
Wait, we got a test
on the first day?


892
00:37:49.076 --> 00:37:53.247
Teddy, it's a pop quiz.
Okay? Look here, folks.


893
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:56.584
I am here to teach
if you're here to learn.


894
00:37:56.667 --> 00:38:00.337
Otherwise, you can get
outta my class right now.


895
00:38:01.005 --> 00:38:02.298
That's what's up.

896
00:38:02.715 --> 00:38:04.508
Welcome to night school.

897
00:38:07.595 --> 00:38:08.679
There you go.

898
00:38:08.762 --> 00:38:11.682
It was terrible,
man! Terrible!


899
00:38:11.765 --> 00:38:14.310
Like, she's not like the teachers
that we had back in the day.


900
00:38:14.393 --> 00:38:16.353
<i>What?</i>
This woman is a brick wall.


901
00:38:16.437 --> 00:38:17.813
And I can't work her.

902
00:38:17.897 --> 00:38:20.065
I can't work a brick wall.

903
00:38:20.232 --> 00:38:21.275
What are you doing?

904
00:38:21.442 --> 00:38:23.242
I'm working out.
I'm trying to shed some lb's.


905
00:38:23.277 --> 00:38:25.529
<i>I wanna feel fit.</i>
Why am I even asking?


906
00:38:25.613 --> 00:38:27.740
<i>In the meantime, please
stop paying for everything</i>


907
00:38:27.823 --> 00:38:29.992
<i>and you have
to get a temp job.</i>


908
00:38:30.493 --> 00:38:32.953
You don't think I've been
looking for a job?


909
00:38:33.037 --> 00:38:35.039
<i>What are you, crazy?
I'm on a treadmill!</i>


910
00:38:35.122 --> 00:38:36.624
The jobs that I want,

911
00:38:36.707 --> 00:38:39.460
they are not going to give
to a high school dropout.

I'd like to get back to learning.

Thank you.

for a minute, if that's okay.

solving the problem.

That's fine with me.

1072
00:45:30.454 --> 00:45:33.582
Okay, so if we're gonna do this,
let's do it step by step.


1073
00:45:33.665 --> 00:45:34.865
Let's make sure
we do it right.

First things first,
let's get rid of this line.

Because it's written sloppy.

1076

So let's get that baby neat.
Eight!


1077

Right?
Huh.


1078
00:45:43.592 --> 00:45:46.136
We got these three sides.
Got a, b, c. Split that.


1079
00:45:46.219 --> 00:45:48.555
That's there.
Take these twos away.

Because that's
what confuses you.


1082
00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:53.935
And then,

1083
00:45:54.936 --> 00:45:56.563
you're realizing what it is.
Eight!


1084
00:45:56.647 --> 00:45:57.898
The answer's five.

1085
00:45:58.732 --> 00:46:03.153
It's five. Easy. Okay, you're
looking at five squared.


1086
00:46:03.236 --> 00:46:06.406
Me up here, I don't have time.
I don't have time.


1087
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.116
Why do I even
waste my time?


1088
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.927
I don't got time to waste my
time on the Pythagorean theorem.


1089
00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:11.119
It's simple.

impressive, Teddy.

00:57:51.277 --> 00:57:52.362
Send it to me
first, please.


1361
00:57:52.445 --> 00:57:53.922
Right, right.
We can email you directly.


1362
00:57:53.946 --> 00:57:55.299
STEWART: Thank you.
WOMAN: That would be great.


1363
00:57:55.323 --> 00:57:57.593
Send out that email tonight, okay?
Thanks so much. Okay. Bye!


1364
00:57:57.617 --> 00:57:59.619
Drive home safe.
Oh, hey!


1365
00:58:00.536 --> 00:58:01.579
Hi.

1366
00:58:01.662 --> 00:58:03.581
Thank you for that great,
wonderful meeting.


1367
00:58:03.664 --> 00:58:05.083
I'm sorry,
do I know you?


1368
00:58:05.166 --> 00:58:07.043
I was in there.
Remember?


1369
00:58:07.752 --> 00:58:10.213
Yes, yes, yes.
Hi. Mrs. Howerton.


1370
00:58:10.296 --> 00:58:12.048
Mrs. Howerton.
Yes, of course.


1371
00:58:12.131 --> 00:58:14.467
No, you brought up
several compelling issues.


1372
00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:15.635
I sure did.

1373
00:58:15.718 --> 00:58:16.987
STEWART: Well, what can
I help you with?


1374
00:58:17.011 --> 00:58:19.263
She sucks at this. Hurry!
I'm almost there.


1375
00:58:19.347 --> 00:58:22.308
So my child gets an assignment
about the solar system,


1376
00:58:22.392 --> 00:58:23.893
and it's to make
a diorama.


1377
00:58:23.976 --> 00:58:25.579
And he doesn't know how
to make a diorama.


1378
00:58:25.603 --> 00:58:27.456
I'm the one with the hot glue
gun in the middle of the night.


1379
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.707
It's 11:00 p.m.
I mean, don't get me wrong.


1380
00:58:28.731 --> 00:58:30.125
We're blessed to go to
school here, but I'm...


1381
00:58:30.149 --> 00:58:31.251
STEWART: I'm sorry,
I have to go.


1382
00:58:31.275 --> 00:58:32.693
Okay? Call my office.
Hurry up!


1383
00:58:32.819 --> 00:58:34.296
THERESA: I will. I'm going, I'm going.
Calm down.


1384
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.863
Come on, Mila!

1385
00:58:35.947 --> 00:58:38.866
You've made some great points, but
I have to go now. Good night.


1386
00:58:39.909 --> 00:58:41.119
Wait a minute!

1387
00:58:41.202 --> 00:58:42.995
Thank you. I have to go.
I really have to go.


1388
00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:44.580
Wait! No! Wait, wait, wait!
What?


1389
00:58:44.664 --> 00:58:45.748
(GROANS)
(GASPS)


1390
00:58:45.832 --> 00:58:48.042
Are you okay?
I feel faint.


1391
00:58:48.126 --> 00:58:49.326
Well, let's get you
some water.


1392
00:58:49.919 --> 00:58:52.672
Thanks for catching me.
Of course. Are you all right?


1393
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:57.426
Are you having a seizure?

1394
00:58:59.929 --> 00:59:01.472
Do you have something
in your teeth?


1395
00:59:01.556 --> 00:59:03.057
I wish I had you in my teeth.

1396
00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:06.644
No, no, no, no. Okay. No. I didn't
realize that's what this was.


1397
00:59:06.727 --> 00:59:08.354
No, thank you. Ma'am.
Gentle touching!


1398
00:59:08.437 --> 00:59:10.707
I am the principal of your child's school.
I have to walk away now.


1399
00:59:10.731 --> 00:59:11.792
I am in a loveless
marriage. Please.


1400
00:59:11.816 --> 00:59:13.025
I am not
participating in this!


1401
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:14.586
You don't have to participate.
Too unprofessional.


1402
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:17.029
I'll do all the work.
I'll do it all. No, I'm...


1403
00:59:17.155 --> 00:59:19.365
If you just look me in the eyes...
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!


1404
00:59:19.448 --> 00:59:20.533
Not appropriate, okay?

1405
00:59:20.616 --> 00:59:22.702
Okay. Here it is.
If this is what you want.


1406
00:59:22.785 --> 00:59:23.929
This is what
it's about with you.


1407
00:59:23.953 --> 00:59:25.413
No, no, no, no!
I am not looking.


1408
00:59:25.496 --> 00:59:28.082
Crack it open like a walnut.
Thank you. No, thank you.


1409
00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:30.418
Crack that nut like a walnut.
Thank you. No, thank you.


1410
00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:33.504
Crack that nut open!
Thank you. No, thank you.


1411
00:59:33.588 --> 00:59:36.257
Do what men do with women's asses.
Oh, man!


1412
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.734
Just tap it!
I can't stand here for this, okay?


1413
00:59:37.758 --> 00:59:39.302
Give it a rat-tat-tap!
Good night!


1414
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:42.013
(PANTING)

1415
00:59:42.263 --> 00:59:43.598
Oh, that was so hard.

1416
00:59:44.182 --> 00:59:45.892
She wanted you so bad.

1417
00:59:46.809 --> 00:59:48.227
But you can't go there.

1418
00:59:49.103 --> 00:59:51.147
Principals have principles.

1419
00:59:51.772 --> 00:59:53.107
(GRUNTS)

1420
00:59:53.191 --> 00:59:56.861
Oh, but you know Stewie would've
tore that ass up though! (CHUCKLES)


1421
00:59:57.904 --> 00:59:59.447
Not a black voice.

1422
01:00:10.666 --> 01:00:11.834
(TYPING)

1423
01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:42.531
(SNEEZES)

1424
01:00:43.908 --> 01:00:44.992
Hello?

1425
01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:46.786
Hello?

1426
01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:48.454
Somebody in here?

1427
01:00:54.794 --> 01:00:55.795
I have a bat

1428
01:00:56.629 --> 01:00:58.047
and I'm not afraid to use it.

1429
01:00:59.257 --> 01:01:02.718
If there is someone in here,
you are trespassing


1430
01:01:03.803 --> 01:01:05.763
and I am well within
my rights


1431
01:01:06.847 --> 01:01:08.391
to defend myself.

1432
01:01:09.225 --> 01:01:13.479
So come on out,
and I won't bash your head.


1433
01:01:14.897 --> 01:01:16.649
MAN: Help!

1434
01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:18.693
Anybody out there?

1435
01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:20.152
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

1436
01:01:21.862 --> 01:01:24.824
Get me out of here! Hey!

1437
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.909
Whoa!

1438
01:01:27.034 --> 01:01:28.369
Okay.
What the hell, Mac?


1439
01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:30.788
That was close.
TEDDY: You're damn right it was, Mac.


1440
01:01:30.871 --> 01:01:32.039
I wonder why.

1441
01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:33.708
Yeah. It's 'cause I sneezed.

1442
01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:35.126
I know what you did.

1443
01:01:35.209 --> 01:01:37.169
What?
I got it.


1444
01:01:39.922 --> 01:01:42.383
I really tried.
I even did the butt stuff.


1445
01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:44.135
I told you
don't do the butt stuff.


1446
01:01:44.218 --> 01:01:45.362
I don't know, fam.
It might have worked.


1447
01:01:45.386 --> 01:01:47.626
It looked like he might've
sauced his drawers, real talk.


1448
01:01:48.014 --> 01:01:49.765
He what?
He was turned on.


1449
01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:52.226
Really?
Shit, I was, too.


1450
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:53.394
Hey!

1451
01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:54.478
Thanks, Jaylen.

1452
01:01:54.562 --> 01:01:56.402
You've got that little
eco-friendly vibe going.


1453
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.815
What's "eco-friendly"?

1454
01:01:57.898 --> 01:01:59.150
Very little waist.

1455
01:01:59.442 --> 01:02:01.193
Oh, I thought
you meant her bush.


1456
01:02:01.277 --> 01:02:03.612
No. Oh, you know what?
I'm with that.


1457
01:02:03.696 --> 01:02:05.239
Hey, now!

1458
01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:06.782
Okay, Jaylen, Jaylen!

1459
01:02:06.866 --> 01:02:08.159
We gotta go, y'all. Let's go.

1460
01:02:08.242 --> 01:02:09.618
Yeah, let's go.
Come on. Come on.


1461
01:02:09.702 --> 01:02:10.703
TEDDY: Shit.

1462
01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:17.626
MAN: Who's out there?
(POUNDING ON DOOR)


1463
01:02:17.793 --> 01:02:19.754
Somebody help me, please.

1464
01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:23.758
What happened?

1465
01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:24.842
I don't know.

1466
01:02:24.925 --> 01:02:27.321
Someone grabbed me from behind
and threw me in the slop sink.


1467
01:02:27.345 --> 01:02:29.388
Game face, Lonnie.

1468
01:02:30.806 --> 01:02:31.891
We're on lockdown.

1469
01:02:31.974 --> 01:02:34.226
MAC: (LAUGHING) Yeah!

1470
01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:36.070
JAYLEN: That'll get him. Hey!
(ALARM BLARING)


1471
01:02:36.103 --> 01:02:37.897
Oh, shit!
Go, go, go!


1472
01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:39.398
JAYLEN: Shit!

1473
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.985
MAC: What are we...
Hey! Shit!


1474
01:02:43.986 --> 01:02:47.448
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, shit just
got real, man, what do we do?


1475
01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.617
<i>I mean, I don't know,
just don't get shot, bro.</i>


1476
01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.969
What do you mean,
"Don't get shot"?


1477
01:02:50.993 --> 01:02:53.245
Bobby, you supposed to be
a hardened criminal, man.


1478
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:54.747
That can't be your advice.

1479
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:56.470
What the hell'd you
go to jail for, Bobby?


1480
01:02:56.665 --> 01:02:59.835
<i>I rob a Whole Foods, bro.
I rob a Whole Foods.</i>


1481
01:02:59.919 --> 01:03:03.631
That's your crime? You went to
jail for stealin' the $15 lettuce?


1482
01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:06.884
<i>No, bro, you sleepin'.
I move some coke or some dope in the day,</i>


1483
01:03:06.967 --> 01:03:10.179
<i>but my kale game, my kale game...</i>
No!


1484
01:03:10.262 --> 01:03:11.847
<i>Now, that's mink!</i>

1485
01:03:11.931 --> 01:03:14.850
<i>Grass-fed beef, you don't know
nothin' about no free-range chicken.</i>

Thug life.

1487
01:03:16.102 --> 01:03:17.353
Wait, Jaylen.
Calm down, Jaylen.


1488
01:03:17.436 --> 01:03:18.997
<i>And I had all the farmer
markets smashed.</i> No! No!


1489
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:21.607
You don't get to explain!
You don't get to explain, Bob!


1490
01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.234
All right, y'all.

1491
01:03:23.317 --> 01:03:26.070
STEWART: (OVER PA) <i>Attention, intruders.
This is Principal Patowsky.</i>

<i>The exit doors are locked down.
There is no escape.</i>


1493
01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:33.202
I can't believe we're gonna
die over a GED practice test!


1494
01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:34.703
It's not even a real test!
Listen.


1495
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:36.539
I just did this
to get out of the house.


1496
01:03:36.705 --> 01:03:37.945
I thought this was
gonna be fun.


1497
01:03:37.998 --> 01:03:40.143
You know, we're gonna break in...
Just shut up! Just shut up!


1498
01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:41.460
Shut up!

1499
01:03:41.544 --> 01:03:42.962
Goddamn!

1500
01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:45.548
Been talking about your kids
and everything all day!


1501
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:47.258
This ain't the time.

1502
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:48.717
Now, y'all pull it together.

1503
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:49.927
We are fine.

1504
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:51.178
We are okay.

1505
01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:52.888
The roof. Let's hit the roof.

1506
01:03:52.972 --> 01:03:55.409
Okay, when I went to school here,
that's how we got out of school,


1507
01:03:55.433 --> 01:03:57.685
and then we would jump onto
the elementary school roof.


1508
01:03:57.768 --> 01:03:58.768

TEDDY: Take that 15 feet,

01:04:29.925 --> 01:04:31.760
minus the three
feet that you can jump.

What are you
talking about?


1530
01:04:33.262 --> 01:04:35.431
All we gotta do is use
the Pythagorean theorem.


1531
01:04:35.514 --> 01:04:37.975
Nobody was listening in class.
Nobody knows how to do that!

No, wait, wait, wait.

1533
01:04:39.435 --> 01:04:41.121
Carrie said in order to use
the Pythagorean theorem,


1534
01:04:41.145 --> 01:04:42.688
you have to know
the hypotenuse.


1535
01:04:42.771 --> 01:04:45.024
All we gotta do
is hypotenuse it.


1536
01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:47.026
A-squared plus b-squared
equals c-squared.


1537
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:48.486
If you know two sides,

1538
01:04:48.569 --> 01:04:51.339
that will help you figure out the
third, so it's roughly six feet across.


1539
01:04:51.363 --> 01:04:54.325
So 15-squared is 225
divided by 6-squared.


1540
01:04:54.408 --> 01:04:55.802
Hypotenuse it!

<i>Hello?</i>


1666
01:09:45.157 --> 01:09:46.158
Ma'am.

1667
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:47.761
<i>I said I don't want the pie.</i>
Okay. Ma'am.


1668
01:09:47.785 --> 01:09:48.786
She don't want the pie.

1669
01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:49.995
Take the pie off.

1670
01:09:50.162 --> 01:09:52.456
<i>I said I ain't gettin' the pie.</i>
Pull up!


1671
01:09:52.539 --> 01:09:53.939
<i>You heard me?</i>
Pull up to the window!


1672
01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:55.667
<i>All right.</i>
When she pull up,


1673
01:09:55.834 --> 01:09:57.954
tell me, 'cause I'mma come
punch the baby in the face.


1674
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.255
God don't see everything.
Just let me know.


1675
01:10:00.422 --> 01:10:02.841
Hey, talk to me, man.
How you doing?


1676
01:10:03.926 --> 01:10:05.803
You know, I thought
it was the Woodbridge punks


1677
01:10:05.886 --> 01:10:07.280
that broke into
the school, but now,


1678
01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:08.514
it all makes sense.

1679
01:10:09.264 --> 01:10:11.517
I found this

1680
01:10:11.683 --> 01:10:13.143
at the scene
of the crime.


1681
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.397
So what'd you do?
Break into my computer?


1682
01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:18.982
Steal the midterm?

1683
01:10:19.066 --> 01:10:21.318
Being a little paranoid,
aren't we, Stew? Am I?


1684
01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:23.588
Stewart, that's a plastic bag
with a chicken wrapper in it


1685
01:10:23.612 --> 01:10:25.089
with the word
"evidence" written on it,


1686
01:10:25.113 --> 01:10:26.740
which is probably
in your handwriting.


1687
01:10:27.866 --> 01:10:29.952
It's not exactly a smoking gun,
Stew.


1688
01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:31.787
It's just
a coincidence, right?


1689
01:10:31.954 --> 01:10:32.955
Probably.

1690
01:10:33.413 --> 01:10:35.207
If you stole that test,

1691
01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:36.792
I will find out, Teddy.

1692
01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.753
I'm an honest man trying
to make an honest living.


1693
01:10:39.837 --> 01:10:42.297
Teddy Walker does not cheat.

1694
01:10:42.756 --> 01:10:44.049
You cheated.

1695
01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:48.595
Every last one of you cheated.

1696
01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:51.598
Uh... Whoa.

1697
01:10:51.807 --> 01:10:54.101
Carrie, those are very
strong accusations.


1698
01:10:54.309 --> 01:10:56.311
For real. Like, what?

1699
01:10:56.395 --> 01:10:57.563
I'm offended.

1700
01:10:57.855 --> 01:10:59.857
Well, I'll take
note of that, Teddy.


1701
01:11:00.232 --> 01:11:01.775
Which one of you
wanna own up to it?


1702
01:11:02.109 --> 01:11:03.527
I'm offended, too.

1703
01:11:04.444 --> 01:11:06.321
Bobby. You a criminal.

1704
01:11:06.405 --> 01:11:08.485
You obviously not good at it.
That's why you in jail.


1705
01:11:08.532 --> 01:11:10.367
Did you orchestrate
this whole thing?


1706
01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:13.412
<i>I mean, why you gonna pick
on me and profile me?</i>


1707
01:11:13.495 --> 01:11:15.455
<i>I'm the only one
locked up here.</i>


1708
01:11:15.622 --> 01:11:17.541
<i>So if I'm locked up in here,</i>

1709
01:11:17.624 --> 01:11:20.377
<i>how can I be out there
stealing the test, Miss Carrie?</i>


1710
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.712
CARRIE: Wait a minute!
(SIGHS)


1711
01:11:21.795 --> 01:11:22.963
Y'all stole the test?

1712
01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:24.882
I'm not sayin' nothin'.
I don't know nothin'.


1713
01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:26.425
I don't know shit.

1714
01:11:26.592 --> 01:11:29.261
'Cause I never said nothin' about
anybody stealing the test.


1715
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.597
I'm about to get to the truth.

1716
01:11:31.763 --> 01:11:33.557
Who stole the test?

1717
01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:35.434
Mac,

1718
01:11:36.101 --> 01:11:38.812
you wanna explain to me
how you got a perfect score?


1719
01:11:38.896 --> 01:11:40.147
Here's the thing.
All right?


1720
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:43.066
I know I didn't get
a perfect score.


1721
01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:44.484
Because I missed
a few on purpose.


1722
01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:45.652
Fudge!

1723
01:11:47.863 --> 01:11:49.197
Thank you!

1724
01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:50.616
<i>You's a snitch, Mac!</i>

1725
01:11:50.699 --> 01:11:52.242
Snitches are bitches.

1726
01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.453
I don't like cheaters.

1727
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:58.624
And I hate that I am teaching
a room full of cheaters!


1728
01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:00.959
I don't like men that cheat.

1729
01:12:01.043 --> 01:12:02.628
I don't like women that cheat.

1730
01:12:02.711 --> 01:12:03.980
I don't even
deal with politicians.


1731
01:12:04.004 --> 01:12:05.881
You know why?
'Cause they all cheaters.


1732
01:12:05.964 --> 01:12:07.382
I don't even eat Cheetos.

1733
01:12:07.466 --> 01:12:09.384
You know why?
'Cause it sound like "cheaters."


1734
01:12:09.468 --> 01:12:11.929
Plus that Cheeto dust'll
give you that Trump color.


1735
01:12:12.179 --> 01:12:13.180
Yeah.

1736
01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:15.849
It's hard to get that Cheeto
dust off your hands.


1737
01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:17.559
It'll mess up your jabos.

1738
01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.436
You know,
I liked you at first.


1739
01:12:20.145 --> 01:12:22.705
I'm done with all of y'all.
All of y'all can get up out my class.


1740
01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:24.066
I'm done with y'all.
What?


1741
01:12:24.232 --> 01:12:25.793
Okay, Carrie, let me...
I wanna say something.


1742
01:12:25.817 --> 01:12:28.046
If I don't get my GED, he's
gonna drop out of high school.


1743
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:30.280
If I don't get my GED,
I'm going to prison.


1744
01:12:30.364 --> 01:12:31.615
<i>I need this GED!</i>

1745
01:12:31.698 --> 01:12:34.385
You need to keep your booty closed.
That's what you need to do. You in jail.


1746
01:12:34.409 --> 01:12:35.827
No, I need this GED.

1747
01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:37.412
We can't live
on Randy's salary.


1748
01:12:37.496 --> 01:12:39.623
Please don't make me go home.
I hate my kids.


1749
01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:42.668
But I love being a mom.

1750
01:12:43.001 --> 01:12:45.337
I'm blessed. So blessed.

LUIS: Carrie, please.

1752
01:12:47.214 --> 01:12:50.592
I cannot live a lifetime of driving
around drunks in a Corolla.

JAYLEN: Look, the last thing
I wanna do


1754
01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:54.096
is be cleaning the rooms
at the Best Western.

Especially them
short stay rooms.


1757

'Cause you know what that is,
right?


1758
01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.476
That's just gonna
be used condoms.

Soiled sheets.

1760

Ain't that where you met
your bottom bitch at?


1761
01:13:05.273 --> 01:13:06.316
You know Trina?

1762
01:13:06.566 --> 01:13:07.818
Mmm-hmm.

1763
01:13:07.901 --> 01:13:09.403
She got a fat ass, too.

1764
01:13:10.112 --> 01:13:12.531
You know what? All of you got
little sob stories


1765
01:13:12.614 --> 01:13:14.199
but y'all should've thought
about that


1766
01:13:14.282 --> 01:13:15.867
before you went
and stole the test.


1767
01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:19.955
Just get the hell
up out my class.

something about Jay.

It was me.

You shouldn't be
mad at none of them.


1778
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:44.914
I mean, yeah,
they looked at the answers,


1779
01:13:44.938 --> 01:13:47.258
but they wouldn't have if I
hadn't had put it on their lap.


1780
01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:51.153
I take responsibility for it
all. I was the mastermind.

01:13:51.236 --> 01:13:53.321
I orchestrated the whole thing.
It was all me.

I appreciate your honesty.

what's right, Carrie.

stuff that you would listen to it.

1818
01:15:16.738 --> 01:15:19.699
STEWART: Well, I am an
outside-of-the-box thinker.


1819
01:15:19.783 --> 01:15:21.201
That's just who I am.

1820
01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:24.121
I think that if students are
excited about their environment,


1821
01:15:24.204 --> 01:15:25.831
they'll be excited
about learning.


1822
01:15:26.081 --> 01:15:28.542
That makes total sense.
I know I would.


1823
01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:30.043
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1824
01:15:30.127 --> 01:15:32.671
If you're interested, I'd love to
give you a tour of the school.


1825
01:15:32.754 --> 01:15:33.964
You could come
by any day,


1826
01:15:34.047 --> 01:15:36.049
or, you know, you could even
come after school.


1827
01:15:36.133 --> 01:15:38.552
We have several night
programs as well.


1828
01:15:40.595 --> 01:15:41.972
Hey.
Hey.


1829
01:15:43.974 --> 01:15:47.102
CARRIE: Okay, show me what you got.
Show me what you got.


1830
01:15:47.269 --> 01:15:49.104
What you got for me? Come on.

1831
01:15:50.105 --> 01:15:51.106
What you got?

1832
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:53.608
You killin' me!
You won!


1833
01:15:53.775 --> 01:15:54.860
Congratulations.

1834
01:15:54.943 --> 01:15:56.444
I'm proud of you, boo.

1835
01:15:56.528 --> 01:15:59.614
Now, it's not cool that you beat
your teacher at Texas hold 'em


1836
01:15:59.698 --> 01:16:02.909
but I like the way you nailed down
the calculations on the pot odds.


1837
01:16:03.076 --> 01:16:05.245
So I'mma let this slide.

1838
01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:06.913
Now, remember
what I said.


1839
01:16:07.164 --> 01:16:08.331
There are no shortcuts.

1840
01:16:08.498 --> 01:16:10.000
You gotta work
your butt off.


1841
01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:12.043
Okay? Give me
some love.


1842
01:16:13.378 --> 01:16:14.629
I'm so proud of you.

1843
01:16:14.713 --> 01:16:16.089
Go on and have
a good day now.


1844
01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:18.300
Maybe one day
I'll take you to Vegas.


1845
01:16:25.473 --> 01:16:26.641
That was cool.

1846
01:16:28.435 --> 01:16:29.936
You know...

1847
01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.248
This used to be the Special Ed
classroom when I went here.


1848
01:16:32.272 --> 01:16:33.732
It still is.

1849
01:16:34.399 --> 01:16:35.609
You teach Special Ed?

1850
01:16:36.484 --> 01:16:38.862
Special Ed is one
of my sections.


1851
01:16:39.779 --> 01:16:41.615
It's one of my
favorites, actually.


1852
01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:47.579
You know, that kid reminds
me a lot of myself.


1853
01:16:48.163 --> 01:16:50.290
I couldn't do math for shit
when I was in school.


1854
01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:53.019
Difference is I didn't have
a teacher like you


1855
01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:54.645
that was willing to
stay behind to help me.


1856
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:56.463
I know what
you're doin', Teddy.


1857
01:16:56.546 --> 01:16:57.631
And I admit,

1858
01:16:57.714 --> 01:17:01.051
it was very cool of you to take
the fall for your classmates.


1859
01:17:02.344 --> 01:17:03.595
But you're a hustler.

1860
01:17:04.137 --> 01:17:06.348
Tryin' to skate by
without doing the work.


1861
01:17:06.514 --> 01:17:08.016
You should know
you can't hustle me.


1862
01:17:08.308 --> 01:17:09.392
I do.

1863
01:17:09.476 --> 01:17:11.770
Okay? I do know that.

1864
01:17:11.853 --> 01:17:13.688
And I promise you, I'm done.

1865
01:17:13.855 --> 01:17:15.440
I'm not hustling no more.

1866
01:17:15.857 --> 01:17:18.401
Night school is about
second chances.


1867
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.529
And if I don't get this second chance,
then it's over for me.


1868
01:17:21.905 --> 01:17:24.074
Night school
is all that I have.


1869
01:17:24.616 --> 01:17:25.617
(SIGHS)

1870
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.994
Please.

1871
01:17:28.912 --> 01:17:30.580
I'll consider it
on one condition.


1872
01:17:31.039 --> 01:17:32.249
Whatever it is.

1873
01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.084
We get you tested.

1874
01:17:34.668 --> 01:17:36.628
For STDs?
That's not an issue.


1875
01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.214
I don't mind that.
I mean...


1876
01:17:39.297 --> 01:17:40.590
God damn it.

1877
01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:44.219
There was one time where the condom popped
'cause I put my balls inside the...


1878
01:17:44.302 --> 01:17:46.429
No, you idiot.

1879
01:17:46.805 --> 01:17:48.473
For learning disabilities.

1880
01:17:50.141 --> 01:17:53.144
Nobody cares about your
escapades with your bitches.


1881
01:17:54.479 --> 01:17:56.606
TEDDY: So what are
the test results, Carrie?


1882
01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:59.025
Teddy, the issue is...

1883
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.445
You're clinically dumb.

1884
01:18:05.824 --> 01:18:07.033
I knew it.

1885
01:18:08.326 --> 01:18:10.537
I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it was a mistake.


1886
01:18:10.912 --> 01:18:12.872
Boy, I'm sorry.
I'm just messin' with you.


1887
01:18:12.956 --> 01:18:14.708
Come on, Carrie.
Look, look.


1888
01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:18.211
My suspicions were right, and you,
my friend, are dyslexic.


1889
01:18:19.087 --> 01:18:20.130
Okay.

1890
01:18:20.547 --> 01:18:22.590
Okay, so that just means
I'm having problems


1891
01:18:22.674 --> 01:18:23.943
with my reading and my writing,
right?


1892
01:18:23.967 --> 01:18:26.678
Yep. But you also have
dyscalculia.


1893
01:18:26.761 --> 01:18:28.841
Dyscalculia? I don't even
know how to pronounce that.


1894
01:18:29.055 --> 01:18:31.933
Basically, it's like dyslexia,
but with math.


1895
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.478
That's what I got.

1896
01:18:35.937 --> 01:18:38.565
I knew it! Now that you say it,
it makes sense.


1897
01:18:38.815 --> 01:18:40.918
If you take me to a restaurant and
you say, "Teddy, leave the tip,"


1898
01:18:40.942 --> 01:18:42.444
I'm all over the place.

1899
01:18:42.527 --> 01:18:44.154
That's exactly what it is.
We did it!


1900
01:18:44.237 --> 01:18:45.363
We're not done.

1901
01:18:45.447 --> 01:18:47.824
You also have
a processing disorder.


1902
01:18:47.907 --> 01:18:50.160
I got a touch
of prostate cancer?


1903
01:18:50.243 --> 01:18:51.619
She didn't touch
my ass one time.


1904
01:18:51.703 --> 01:18:54.330
I said
"processing disorder."


1905
01:18:54.497 --> 01:18:56.583
Carrie, if you're not
gonna help me,


1906
01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:57.959
then we're wasting our time.

1907
01:18:58.043 --> 01:19:00.045
Explain to me
what this stuff is.


1908
01:19:00.128 --> 01:19:02.714
If I got a processing...
Oh, my God.


1909
01:19:04.758 --> 01:19:06.092
I'm not processing it.

1910
01:19:08.053 --> 01:19:09.888
I didn't process
none of that shit.


1911
01:19:09.971 --> 01:19:14.726
You are just one big, beautiful mixed
drink of learning disabilities.


1912
01:19:14.809 --> 01:19:16.144
So I'm not dumb?

1913
01:19:16.227 --> 01:19:18.271
Boy, I was just playin'
when I said that earlier.


1914
01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:21.107
No good teacher would ever
call their students dumb.


1915
01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:22.609
Okay.

1916
01:19:23.026 --> 01:19:24.736
So how do we fix it?
Let's talk solution.


1917
01:19:24.819 --> 01:19:26.488
Well, there's no cure
for what you have.


1918
01:19:26.571 --> 01:19:28.156
Oh, my God!

1919
01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:30.909
I got learning herpes?

1920
01:19:30.992 --> 01:19:32.035
Boy!

1921
01:19:32.118 --> 01:19:33.453
Oh, shit!

1922
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:36.039
There is no such thing
as learning herpes.


1923
01:19:36.122 --> 01:19:37.415
I'm blistering up.

1924
01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.501
It's 'cause
I'm tryin' to think.


1925
01:19:39.584 --> 01:19:41.294
Hey, Teddy!

1926
01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:42.545
TEDDY: Big Mac.

1927
01:19:43.421 --> 01:19:44.690
LUIS: Ringleader.
THERESA: Oh, my gosh!


1928
01:19:44.714 --> 01:19:45.799
Teddy, you're here!

1929
01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:47.675
<i>Hey, Teddy!
What's up, man?</i>


1930
01:19:47.759 --> 01:19:49.469
Teaching the
conventional way


1931
01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:51.554
just isn't gonna
get it done for Teddy.


1932
01:19:51.638 --> 01:19:53.306
So we're gonna mix it up.

1933
01:19:54.015 --> 01:19:55.308
They out here
getting it in.


1934
01:19:56.226 --> 01:19:57.620
What's going on, Carrie?
Why you in here?


1935
01:19:57.644 --> 01:19:59.479
Why you in the ring?
What's going on?


1936
01:19:59.604 --> 01:20:02.690
Teddy, your difficulties are focus-related.
Uh-huh.


1937
01:20:02.774 --> 01:20:05.151
My goal is to remove
that mind chatter


1938
01:20:05.235 --> 01:20:08.363
so you can achieve properly
unencumbered neural pathways.


1939
01:20:08.446 --> 01:20:09.948
And this isn't a ring.

1940
01:20:10.031 --> 01:20:11.282
It's a hexagon.

1941
01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:14.119
Oh, it is. Yeah.

1942
01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:15.846
Why are you taking
your shoes off?


1943
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:16.913
Is this somebody's carpet?

1944
01:20:16.996 --> 01:20:19.249
Teddy, what's the square
root of 81?


1945
01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:20.917
What?

1946
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.043
Ow!

1947
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:24.671
Shit!

1948
01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:25.964
What's the square
root of 81?


1949
01:20:26.047 --> 01:20:27.090
I don't know!

1950
01:20:27.173 --> 01:20:28.258
What you doing?

1951
01:20:28.967 --> 01:20:30.277
Carrie!
What's the square root of 81?


1952
01:20:30.301 --> 01:20:31.386
You breaking my arm!

1953
01:20:31.469 --> 01:20:32.947
Come on, we're clearing
those neural pathways.


1954
01:20:32.971 --> 01:20:34.013
No!
Stop it!


1955
01:20:34.097 --> 01:20:35.348
Hey! What you doing?

1956
01:20:35.723 --> 01:20:37.058
Focus!

1957
01:20:37.142 --> 01:20:39.018
Square root! Focus!

1958
01:20:39.185 --> 01:20:41.437
I don't know! Oh, God!
(BONES CRACK)


1959
01:20:43.106 --> 01:20:45.817
Concentrate. Teddy,
concentrate.


1960
01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.443
Come on, Teddy. Come on.

1961
01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.783
How you feelin' today, Teddy?

1962
01:20:53.867 --> 01:20:56.286
I'm feeling
fine, Carrie,


1963
01:20:56.369 --> 01:20:59.247
but I ain't feelin' this
Mr. Miyagi shit. Okay?


1964
01:20:59.414 --> 01:21:00.790
What's the capital of Belgium?

1965
01:21:01.249 --> 01:21:02.292
Uh...

1966
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:03.710
Waffles?

1967
01:21:03.793 --> 01:21:05.086
What?
Run!


1968
01:21:05.879 --> 01:21:07.338
Don't you run from me!

1969
01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:08.464
Don't! He's so little!

1970
01:21:09.174 --> 01:21:11.301
Jesus! What is the
capital of Belgium?


1971
01:21:11.384 --> 01:21:13.261
I haven't eaten

01:27:38.312 --> 01:27:39.814
That's my woman!

2128
01:27:40.273 --> 01:27:41.941
TEDDY: That's not for
kids, Theresa!


2129
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:43.484
JAYLEN: Go, T!

<i>No matter what it takes You know
I'm always gonna keep fighting</i>


2135
01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.137
<i>I'm fighting</i>

2136
01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:15.308
<i>I'm never gonna
let the dream go</i>

<i>No desert, no snake gonna

<i>Take me down, no way</i>

2142
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.492
Wait, sweetheart,
who's watching the kids?


2143
01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:35.036
I got it covered.

2144
01:28:35.661 --> 01:28:38.331
<i>She said, "I wanna be
a flight attendant."</i>


2145
01:28:38.497 --> 01:28:39.540
<i>You see?</i>

2146
01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:42.701
<i>"I wanna go from place to place.
It'd be like going..."</i>


2147
01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:47.465
<i>Is y'all little bitches
listening?</i>


2148
01:28:50.217 --> 01:28:52.219
You know, Carrie,
you are incredible.


2149
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:54.055
I'm serious.

2150
01:28:54.221 --> 01:28:56.941
There's never been a teacher that
believed in me the way that you do.


2151
01:28:56.974 --> 01:28:58.726
Teddy, what can I say?

2152
01:28:58.893 --> 01:29:02.063
You've grown so much in such
a short period of time.


2153
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:05.024
And if you keep up with all the
stuff that we've been doing,


2154
01:29:05.191 --> 01:29:06.901
you are well on your way.

2155
01:29:07.902 --> 01:29:09.278
I'm just...

2156
01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:11.489
I'm really,
really proud of you.


2157
01:29:18.204 --> 01:29:19.622
You know, Carrie,

2158
01:29:20.998 --> 01:29:23.125
these past few weeks
have been amazing.


2159
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:27.546
I mean, our chemistry,
it goes without saying, it's strong.


2160
01:29:27.713 --> 01:29:29.632
I sense it.
I know you do, too.


2161
01:29:29.715 --> 01:29:32.677
But as magical as these moments
that we've been having may be...


2162
01:29:32.843 --> 01:29:34.095
Fool, I'm gay.

2163
01:29:34.178 --> 01:29:35.638
I'm not tryin' to play.

2164
01:29:35.721 --> 01:29:37.161
Now, I'm not sayin'
I ain't no freak.


2165
01:29:37.223 --> 01:29:38.391
'Cause I'd drop it
off on you.


2166
01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:39.684
I'm a lesbian.

2167
01:29:39.767 --> 01:29:42.561
If you wanna pursue acting,
you can.


2168
01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:43.896
No, I'm gay.

2169
01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:45.582
Say that again. It sound like
you said you're gay.


2170
01:29:45.606 --> 01:29:46.857
I'm gay.

2171
01:29:46.941 --> 01:29:48.567
I like women.

2172
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:50.695
Are you sure?

2173
01:29:50.778 --> 01:29:52.005
Because I'm getting
a whole different vibe.


2174
01:29:52.029 --> 01:29:53.389
LISA: Oh, hell no!
I'm pretty sure.


2175
01:29:53.489 --> 01:29:54.699
Oh, God.

2176
01:29:57.118 --> 01:29:58.202
Teddy?

2177
01:29:58.744 --> 01:30:01.372
Is the one on the left
your type?


2178
01:30:01.455 --> 01:30:03.916
Uh-uh. The one in the tight dress is.
Shit, that's mine.


2179
01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:07.044
Hey!

2180
01:30:07.211 --> 01:30:08.337
There they go.

2181
01:30:08.838 --> 01:30:10.381
What are you doin' here?

2182
01:30:11.132 --> 01:30:12.174
Huh?

2183
01:30:12.258 --> 01:30:14.135
What are you doing
at a high school prom?


2184
01:30:15.553 --> 01:30:17.054
What are you
doin' here, babe?


2185
01:30:17.138 --> 01:30:18.222
Why you here?

2186
01:30:19.306 --> 01:30:22.309
Principal Patowsky is interested
in us redesigning the school


2187
01:30:22.476 --> 01:30:24.236
so he asked us to stop by...
Oh, he did, huh?


2188
01:30:24.395 --> 01:30:25.438
Yeah.

2189
01:30:25.604 --> 01:30:27.273
Well played, Stewart.

2190
01:30:27.982 --> 01:30:29.442
You two know each other?

2191
01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:31.360
Ask Stewart.

2192
01:30:31.819 --> 01:30:33.446
Yes, we went to
high school together.


2193
01:30:33.612 --> 01:30:35.614
I think I mentioned that
at our first meeting.


2194
01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:36.782
No.

2195
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.868
No, you didn't.

2196
01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:42.204
Teddy, I am so confused.

2197
01:30:42.288 --> 01:30:43.664
Why are you here?

2198
01:30:43.748 --> 01:30:44.915
And who is she?

2199
01:30:44.999 --> 01:30:46.751
I can explain.
It ain't what it look like.


2200
01:30:46.834 --> 01:30:48.669
I'm in here with
a bunch of kids,


2201
01:30:48.753 --> 01:30:50.212
dressed in street clothes,

2202
01:30:50.379 --> 01:30:52.099
then remember I blew out
the barbecue shack.


2203
01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.009
Fire took me out
of that thing.


2204
01:30:55.384 --> 01:30:57.678
And now my
windshield was...


2205
01:30:57.845 --> 01:30:59.472
What's got me messed
up about the car...


2206
01:30:59.555 --> 01:31:01.098
My brakes ain't workin'

2207
01:31:01.265 --> 01:31:02.892
'cause I backed
into this...


2208
01:31:02.975 --> 01:31:04.143
She gay!

2209
01:31:05.227 --> 01:31:06.854
She ain't even
interested in me.


2210
01:31:07.313 --> 01:31:08.314
So...

2211
01:31:09.607 --> 01:31:11.317
God damn it. Lisa.

2212
01:31:11.484 --> 01:31:12.651
Not now. Not now.
Wait.


2213
01:31:12.735 --> 01:31:13.819
Lisa!

2214
01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.907
Okay, Lisa. Lisa, Lisa.

2215
01:31:18.282 --> 01:31:19.950
Lisa, can you
listen, please?


2216
01:31:20.034 --> 01:31:22.161
Lisa, please, just listen!
What?


2217
01:31:22.578 --> 01:31:23.954
What are you
gonna say, Teddy?


2218
01:31:26.165 --> 01:31:27.958
I'm a high school dropout.

2219
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:30.753
Okay? That woman in there,
Carrie,


2220
01:31:30.836 --> 01:31:32.546
that's my night
school teacher.


2221
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.357
That's what I've been doin'
all these evenings.


2222
01:31:34.381 --> 01:31:36.175
I've been studying to get my GED

2223
01:31:36.342 --> 01:31:38.219
so that I can get
a job at Marvin's.


2224
01:31:39.178 --> 01:31:40.846
So you don't work there now?

2225
01:31:42.807 --> 01:31:44.350
I don't work there yet.

2226
01:31:45.267 --> 01:31:48.854
Right now, I work at a fast food
restaurant called Christian Chicken


2227
01:31:48.938 --> 01:31:51.023
where the chicken is Christian
for some reason.


2228
01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:54.819
Wait, Lisa, let me just say
this before you judge him.


2229
01:31:54.902 --> 01:31:56.320
It ain't that
average chicken.


2230
01:31:56.445 --> 01:31:57.696
It's not the
same fast food


2231
01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:59.925
that you be gettin' from these
other little hood spots.


2232
01:31:59.949 --> 01:32:02.284
It's got the flavor. I don't
know if they use a needle,


2233
01:32:02.368 --> 01:32:04.248
but they get the flavor in deep.
Jaylen, Jaylen!


2234
01:32:05.037 --> 01:32:06.372
How do you know my name?

2235
01:32:06.455 --> 01:32:08.433
My nigga be talking about you
in the class all the time.


2236
01:32:08.457 --> 01:32:10.668
He said you was bad. I didn't
know you was that bad.


2237
01:32:10.751 --> 01:32:11.961
We're Teddy's
classmates.


2238
01:32:12.044 --> 01:32:14.046
I'm Theresa.
That's Jaylen, Mila,


2239
01:32:14.129 --> 01:32:15.673
Mackenzie, and Luis.
Hey.


2240
01:32:16.257 --> 01:32:17.341
You remember me?

2241
01:32:17.424 --> 01:32:20.135
I was actually the waiter
at the restaurant


2242
01:32:20.219 --> 01:32:22.221
when Teddy pulled
all of his pubes


2243
01:32:22.304 --> 01:32:24.723
and he put 'em in the cheesecake
to get out of paying.


2244
01:32:25.224 --> 01:32:27.017
Now, we're best friends.

2245
01:32:28.352 --> 01:32:29.478
(SCOFFS)

2246
01:32:29.562 --> 01:32:31.397
Thank you for your honesty.

2247
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.441
Honesty.

2248
01:32:35.067 --> 01:32:36.443
I know

2249
01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:39.446
that this is
a lot to take in.


2250
01:32:39.613 --> 01:32:40.614
Really?

2251
01:32:41.031 --> 01:32:42.867
But if you let me explain...
No.


2252
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:44.618
If you let me explain...
No, Teddy.


2253
01:32:44.702 --> 01:32:45.995
I'm done with
your explanations.


2254
01:32:47.746 --> 01:32:49.456
You lied to me
about everything.


2255
01:32:50.749 --> 01:32:51.876
Why?

2256
01:32:52.501 --> 01:32:53.711
To impress me?

2257
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:55.880
Teddy, I make my own money.

2258
01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:58.024
You think I care about
what kind of car you drive


2259
01:32:58.048 --> 01:32:59.592
or what kind of watch
you have on?


2260
01:33:00.843 --> 01:33:02.136
That's not me.

2261
01:33:02.928 --> 01:33:05.055
If you think that,
then you don't know me.


2262
01:33:05.222 --> 01:33:06.390
That's not true.

2263
01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.760
If you don't know me, then
you couldn't truly love me.


2264
01:33:08.934 --> 01:33:10.311
That's not true, Lisa.

2265
01:33:13.522 --> 01:33:15.274
Don't come back
to the apartment tonight.


2266
01:33:19.069 --> 01:33:21.629
I don't know, maybe you could stay
with your night school friend.


2267
01:33:24.408 --> 01:33:26.076
Maybe she has
some use for this.


2268
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:29.455
It's probably
fake, right?


2269
01:33:34.084 --> 01:33:36.378
MAYA: Lisa! Lisa... Lisa!

2270
01:33:47.348 --> 01:33:50.100
GLADYS: I cut the crust off.
Just how you like it.


2271
01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.519
Thanks, Ma.

2272
01:33:53.062 --> 01:33:56.649
You're not seriously skipping
that GED test, are you?


2273
01:33:56.857 --> 01:33:57.858
Yeah.

2274
01:33:58.525 --> 01:34:00.694
I mean, I was doing
all that stuff for Lisa.


2275
01:34:01.153 --> 01:34:02.833
If she's not around,
then what's the point?


2276
01:34:02.863 --> 01:34:05.449
My poor baby,
I feel terrible.


2277
01:34:06.283 --> 01:34:08.285
Oh, Gladys, now stop
coddling this boy.


2278
01:34:09.328 --> 01:34:11.747
You know, Theodore,
you're a grown-ass man.


2279
01:34:12.247 --> 01:34:13.707
You need to get
your shit together.


2280
01:34:13.832 --> 01:34:14.959
I know, Dad.

2281
01:34:15.042 --> 01:34:19.505
I mean, you say you got
dyslexia, dyscoglia...


2282
01:34:20.172 --> 01:34:22.341
Dyscalculia.
However you say it.


2283
01:34:22.675 --> 01:34:24.468
The issue is,
you're dishonest.


2284
01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:26.845
I don't blame that girl
for dumping you.


2285
01:34:26.929 --> 01:34:29.056
Now, Gerald,
that is enough.


2286
01:34:32.142 --> 01:34:33.182
You know, maybe you right.

2287
01:34:34.103 --> 01:34:35.145
Maybe I do deserve it.

2288
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:36.313
Ya think?

2289
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:38.816
I was being sarcastic.

2290
01:34:39.817 --> 01:34:41.735
I'll get your bed
ready, baby.


2291
01:34:41.819 --> 01:34:43.028
Would you like a tuck-in?

2292
01:34:43.112 --> 01:34:44.279
Yes, please.

2293
01:34:46.532 --> 01:34:48.200
Thank you, Mom.
Anything for you, darling.


2294
01:34:54.206 --> 01:34:55.499
I failed.

2295
01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.503
I failed as a father.

2296
01:35:00.754 --> 01:35:02.464
A tuck-in?

2297
01:35:05.134 --> 01:35:07.195
(WHISPERS) Oh, my gosh.
Why'd he come on the bus like that?


2298
01:35:07.219 --> 01:35:09.012
I don't know.
He ain't got no friends.


2299
01:35:09.722 --> 01:35:11.223
That's what I think.

2300
01:35:14.143 --> 01:35:15.394
What's the problem?

2301
01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.605
Christian Chicken!

2302
01:35:18.772 --> 01:35:20.399
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

2303
01:35:20.482 --> 01:35:22.484
Honk once if you love chicken!

2304
01:35:22.568 --> 01:35:24.987
Honk twice
if you love the Lord.


2305
01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.574
Come and get your chicken
if you ready to start winning.


2306
01:35:29.366 --> 01:35:31.201
Hey! Sellout!

2307
01:35:31.618 --> 01:35:33.704
What?
You a sellout, man.


2308
01:35:33.787 --> 01:35:35.181
Brother, I'm just tryin'
to make a honest livin'.


2309
01:35:35.205 --> 01:35:36.457
Why don't you
get off my back?


2310
01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.250
Go get a job
at the post office then!


2311
01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:40.213
Get your ass up out of here.
What? Say it again.


2312
01:35:40.252 --> 01:35:42.337
Come on, man!
Go ahead with that.


2313
01:35:42.421 --> 01:35:43.547
Stay woke, bro.

2314
01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:46.216
Yeah, well, I see you ate the
chicken, you son of a bitch.


2315
01:35:49.011 --> 01:35:51.263
So this is what
it's come to, huh?


2316
01:35:53.974 --> 01:35:55.684
You got some nerve, man.

2317
01:35:56.143 --> 01:35:57.686
Teddy, look...

2318
01:35:59.021 --> 01:36:01.815
I came here to apologize.

2319
01:36:02.357 --> 01:36:03.859
I'm on my break.

2320
01:36:04.026 --> 01:36:06.004
I ain't got time for this.
Teddy, please, just listen.


2321
01:36:06.028 --> 01:36:07.547
I don't wanna hear nothin'
you got to say, man.


2322
01:36:07.571 --> 01:36:08.673
No. Please,
just listen to me.


2323
01:36:08.697 --> 01:36:09.758
I don't have nothin'
to say to you!


2324
01:36:09.782 --> 01:36:11.825
I have something to say to you, okay?
What? What?


2325
01:36:11.909 --> 01:36:14.369
Give me 30 seconds, okay?

2326
01:36:14.536 --> 01:36:17.664
Listen, when we were in high school,
you had everything that I wanted.


2327
01:36:17.748 --> 01:36:19.208
You got 28 seconds left.

2328
01:36:19.291 --> 01:36:20.542
I had grades.
That's all I had.


2329
01:36:20.626 --> 01:36:24.129
You had sports,
friends, girls.


2330
01:36:24.213 --> 01:36:25.923
I sucked at all that.

2331
01:36:26.006 --> 01:36:28.091
I was 27 when I got
my first hand job.


2332
01:36:28.634 --> 01:36:32.012
You're at one, but before I walk
away, I wanna tell you that's sad.


2333
01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:34.431
That's my point. I don't care!
Why you telling me?


2334
01:36:34.515 --> 01:36:36.995
My point is, I was a late bloomer,
and I was desperate and sad.


2335
01:36:37.059 --> 01:36:38.143
And I blamed you.

2336
01:36:38.977 --> 01:36:41.897
And the other night,
when I got my revenge,


2337
01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:43.398
it felt awful.

2338
01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:48.111
I got into education to make a difference
in people's lives, not to ruin them.


2339
01:36:49.279 --> 01:36:50.489
Also,

2340
01:36:50.656 --> 01:36:54.368
I told Stewart here I'd beat his ass
if he didn't come and apologize.


2341
01:36:54.451 --> 01:36:57.412
That is true. That was a part of
it. A small part.


2342
01:36:57.496 --> 01:36:58.872
Okay, you know
what, guys?


2343
01:36:58.956 --> 01:37:02.543
I appreciate the whole "after
school special" moment.


2344
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:04.837
But understand
that I am okay.


2345
01:37:05.003 --> 01:37:07.464
I am where I'm supposed to be.
All right?


2346
01:37:07.548 --> 01:37:10.342
Your destiny is to work at a fast
food joint next to a strip club?


2347
01:37:10.425 --> 01:37:11.677
Yes. All right?

2348
01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.929
If I stand in the right spot
in this parking lot,


2349
01:37:14.012 --> 01:37:17.349
I can smell cocoa butter and
fried chicken at the same time.


2350
01:37:17.641 --> 01:37:19.786
And I don't know about you guys,
but that's a win for me.


2351
01:37:19.810 --> 01:37:22.271
Teddy, listen to me.
Ain't no "Teddy, listen."


2352
01:37:22.396 --> 01:37:23.939
You know I wasn't
gonna pass that test,


2353
01:37:24.022 --> 01:37:26.900
so don't sit here and act like it
was gonna be a different story.


2354
01:37:26.984 --> 01:37:29.796
And don't act like you don't wanna be
able to finally say that I'm dumb.


2355
01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:30.863
No, you're not.

2356
01:37:30.946 --> 01:37:32.906
You can finally say it, Stew.
Say it!


2357
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:34.283
Teddy.

2358
01:37:35.409 --> 01:37:37.452
You are a lot of things.

2359
01:37:37.619 --> 01:37:40.163
A hustler, a liar.

2360
01:37:40.497 --> 01:37:41.665
You're very short.

2361
01:37:41.832 --> 01:37:43.041
Mad loud, too.

2362
01:37:43.125 --> 01:37:44.251
Mmm-hmm.

2363
01:37:44.418 --> 01:37:46.587
But you are not dumb!

2364
01:37:47.004 --> 01:37:49.882
Now, this suit you got
on is dumb as hell.


2365
01:37:50.048 --> 01:37:52.175
I rebuke you! Rebuke!

2366
01:37:52.342 --> 01:37:54.386
I rebuke you!
I'm going to work.


2367
01:37:54.511 --> 01:37:55.822
Now, let me go get...
Give me this thing.


2368
01:37:55.846 --> 01:37:57.282
What you doing, Carrie?
Take this off right now.


2369
01:37:57.306 --> 01:37:59.033
Take this suit off,
and you gonna take this test!


2370
01:37:59.057 --> 01:38:00.058
No, no, no.

2371
01:38:00.142 --> 01:38:01.494
No, let's use our words.
You gonna take this test!


2372
01:38:01.518 --> 01:38:02.662
All right, come here.
You know what?


2373
01:38:02.686 --> 01:38:03.872
What you doin'?
She has a belt!


2374
01:38:03.896 --> 01:38:04.980
She's got a belt!

2375
01:38:05.063 --> 01:38:06.481
Take this suit off,

2376
01:38:06.565 --> 01:38:07.834
and you gonna take that test!
Guys, guys, guys!


2377
01:38:07.858 --> 01:38:08.918
We need to keep our hands to ourselves.
You stop!


2378
01:38:08.942 --> 01:38:10.003
You stop!
Get off me! Dang it!


2379
01:38:10.027 --> 01:38:11.337
This gonna hurt me more
than it's gonna hurt you!


2380
01:38:11.361 --> 01:38:13.530
Oh, God! I can't be
a part of this.


2381
01:38:13.614 --> 01:38:15.866
You're breaking the skin!
Tear your ass up.


2382
01:38:16.074 --> 01:38:17.492
Okay, this seems
like a black thing.


2383
01:38:17.576 --> 01:38:19.161
So I'm just gonna
order us some food.


2384
01:38:19.244 --> 01:38:20.370
All right!
Now, listen to me!


2385
01:38:20.454 --> 01:38:21.598
All right!
Are you listening to me?


2386
01:38:21.622 --> 01:38:22.664
Yes!

2387
01:38:22.748 --> 01:38:24.124
Now, you have
worked too hard


2388
01:38:24.207 --> 01:38:27.294
to be running around here
in a damn holy chicken suit.


2389
01:38:27.586 --> 01:38:29.046
Okay?
Yes.


2390
01:38:29.212 --> 01:38:31.214
Now, either you
get in the car


2391
01:38:31.632 --> 01:38:33.592
and you take that test,

2392
01:38:33.884 --> 01:38:36.887
or I continue to
tenderize your ass.


2393
01:38:37.054 --> 01:38:38.472
Your choice.

2394
01:38:42.684 --> 01:38:45.020
Are you ready?
Good luck, guys.


2395
01:38:45.812 --> 01:38:47.397
Yeah.
I'm back.


2396
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:49.191
Hey, Carrie.

2397
01:38:57.282 --> 01:38:58.951
MAC: Teddy!
MILA: Teddy's back!


2398

What's up, Ted?</i>


2399
01:39:00.953 --> 01:39:03.163
THERESA: Hey, Teddy!
MAC: Teddy! Teddy!


2400
01:39:03.288 --> 01:39:04.373
Yes!

2401
01:39:05.207 --> 01:39:07.542
What up, king?
Come on, man!


2402
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.628
Let's do this.

2403
01:39:09.711 --> 01:39:11.129
LUIS: A hero returns.

2404
01:39:14.174 --> 01:39:16.301
CARRIE: Okay, we're complete.

2405
01:39:16.468 --> 01:39:20.514
So let's turn on those
computers and ace this thing!


2406
01:39:20.597 --> 01:39:21.640
Go!

2407
01:39:23.225 --> 01:39:24.935
Okay, robot.

2408
01:39:25.435 --> 01:39:27.771
You bowing down
to a god today.


2409
01:39:32.651 --> 01:39:34.277
Good luck, everybody.

2410
01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:38.907
(GRUNTING)

2411
01:39:54.089 --> 01:39:55.632
Come on, Teddy.

2412
01:40:01.722 --> 01:40:02.848
CARRIE: <i>Focus.</i>

2413

<i>Concentrate. Get rid of that
mind chatter.</i>


2414
01:40:07.019 --> 01:40:08.353
Come on, focus!

2415
01:40:08.437 --> 01:40:10.355
Focus!
Oh, God!


2416
01:40:10.439 --> 01:40:12.524
Focus. You better
get it right!


2417
01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:14.401
Focus! Focus!

2418
01:40:42.054 --> 01:40:43.055
Yeah!

2419
01:40:45.057 --> 01:40:46.183
Shh.

2420
01:40:49.853 --> 01:40:52.481
Okay, everybody, calm
down. All right?


2421
01:40:52.564 --> 01:40:54.608
The results will be in
online in just a minute.


2422
01:40:54.691 --> 01:40:56.777
If you get over 145,
you pass.


2423
01:40:56.943 --> 01:40:58.070
TEDDY: She's right.

2424
01:40:58.153 --> 01:41:00.131
All right, you do the hard work,
you get rewarded for it.


2425
01:41:00.155 --> 01:41:01.382
No need to panic.
(DEVICE CHIMES)


2426
01:41:01.406 --> 01:41:03.116
Hey, hey, hey!
The results just came in.


2427
01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.826
Oh, shit!
MAC: Oh, my gosh!


2428
01:41:05.744 --> 01:41:07.871
I passed! I got a 146!

2429
01:41:08.038 --> 01:41:10.207
146, Mac! Yeah!

2430
01:41:10.373 --> 01:41:11.625
Way to go.
MAC: Yes, yes!


2431
01:41:11.708 --> 01:41:13.043
Management,
here I come, baby!


2432

I'm Teddy Walker,
and I'm a liar.

For years, I've been pretending
to be somebody else.

Somebody that I'm not.

2542
01:45:57.369 --> 01:45:59.788
My reason for doing that is
because I was ashamed.

Ashamed that I didn't learn
like my classmates.

went into learning in school.

never had you."

"Oh, God, if I could get that one back."
I remember you said that.

was said out of love
