1
00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:10.443
I'm gonna tell you some story.

2
00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:12.983
When I was on Manus Island, the people

3
00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:15.163
call me 'Lion' Farhad.

4
00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:18.503
And I don't know why they call me

5
00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:20.923
maybe I was tough and really strong.

6
00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:26.363
from Jakarta to Christmas Island

7
00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:29.463
We were like 65 people

8
00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:31.623
with families, some kids.

9
00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:34.023
Everyone is sleeping, someone vomiting

10
00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.223
in the edge of the

11
00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:38.322
fisher boat.

12
00:01:39.523 --> 00:01:41.523
Big wave came

13
00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:44.322
half of my body was under the ocean.

14
00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:48.223
I could see there is a rope.

15
00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:49.943
And I hold it.

16
00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.042
I grabbed it and no one knew.

17
00:01:55.523 --> 00:01:58.203
I survived from that time

18
00:01:58.723 --> 00:02:01.083
and I came back, said wow

19
00:02:02.203 --> 00:02:04.323
So I will be alive.

20
00:02:07.963 --> 00:02:09.823
There was something inside

21
00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:13.123
and I believe that one
day I will be free.

22
00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:17.703
I didn't know they're gonna exile us

23
00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:20.563
to Manus and Nauru for six years.

24
00:02:21.763 --> 00:02:23.763
I was there for six years.

25
00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:26.383
And then they transferred me

26
00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:28.483
to Australia for medical help.

27
00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:34.323
Still I am suffering from the
pain and what happened to me

28
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:38.323
but I am a still strong, 
I am still the lion.

29
00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:45.203
My life was the size of a room

30
00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:47.563
for years and years.

31
00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:51.703
I think it was a miracle

32
00:02:51.803 --> 00:02:53.803
that I survived.

33
00:02:54.523 --> 00:02:57.423
All those years that I was in detention

34
00:02:57.523 --> 00:02:59.763
was like a nightmare.

35
00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:04.483
Torture after torture.

36
00:03:07.283 --> 00:03:09.823
I didn't want to get angry.

37
00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.523
I wanted to be kind to myself.

38
00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:16.923
I decided to keep my smile.

39
00:03:17.803 --> 00:03:20.403
And I wanted to be a person

40
00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:24.763
for people who don't have voice.

41
00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:29.843
I learned to be patient.

42
00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:34.423
I learned to become friends with music,

43
00:03:34.523 --> 00:03:36.523
with painting.

44
00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:41.903
When I got my freedom

45
00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:44.523
I felt I have a new sense.

46
00:03:45.883 --> 00:03:48.503
I felt that I
have a pair of wings

47
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.603
and I'm gonna fly.

48
00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:28.663
We will decide

49
00:04:28.763 --> 00:04:31.503
who comes to this country and the circumstances

50
00:04:31.603 --> 00:04:33.603
in which they come.

51
00:04:35.803 --> 00:04:39.983
After rescuing more than 400 muslim asylum seekers,

52
00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.663
no one could have predicted the

53
00:04:41.763 --> 00:04:43.763
dramatic sea change ahead.

54
00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:55.863
From now on, any
asylum seeker who arrives in

55
00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.903
Australia by boat will have
no chance of being settled in

56
00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:00.863
Australia as refugees.

57
00:05:00.963 --> 00:05:02.143
The boats, the boats

58
00:05:02.243 --> 00:05:05.083
will be stopped.

59
00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:09.983
You have been brought to
this place here because you

60
00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:13.483
have sought to illegally enter Australia, by boat.

61
00:05:14.843 --> 00:05:17.583
Persons transferred to regional processing centers

62
00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.903
will not be settled
in this country and the

63
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.423
position of this government will not change.

64
00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:26.363
Are you saying that unaccompanied
minors would be better off

65
00:05:26.683 --> 00:05:28.683
in detention?

66
00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:32.223
The Australian government forbids journalists

67
00:05:32.323 --> 00:05:35.363
from filming or interviewing detainees at its camps.

68
00:05:37.323 --> 00:05:40.023
This policy has been incredibly dehumanising.

69
00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:42.303
It's like this is a horrible human

70
00:05:42.403 --> 00:05:44.442
experiment that has no end.

71
00:05:45.683 --> 00:05:48.743
The Guardian newspaper has
been leaked more than 2,000

72
00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:52.103
incident reports from Australia's Nauru detention camp.

73
00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.583
The sexual assault of
young children, the physical assault

74
00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:56.703
of young children, the deleterious impact

75
00:05:56.803 --> 00:05:59.503
of detention on children,

76
00:05:59.603 --> 00:06:02.023
suicide attempts by children, self-harm attempts

77
00:06:02.123 --> 00:06:04.123
and we've seen that continue.

78
00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:45.343
We have been denied

79
00:06:45.442 --> 00:06:48.223
our basic needs, water and food and electricity.

80
00:06:48.323 --> 00:06:51.363
That does not mean that
we are going to surrender.

81
00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:54.942
We have been in this place
for four and a half years

82
00:06:55.043 --> 00:06:57.563
and we have not committed in any crime.

83
00:06:57.963 --> 00:07:00.743
We are asking the international community

84
00:07:00.843 --> 00:07:02.823
to rescue us from this disaster.

85
00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.183
We have been struggling with

86
00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:06.223
starvation.

87
00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:08.423
I would like to say

88
00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:11.063
and send this clear message to the government.

89
00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:13.543
We only want freedom in

90
00:07:13.643 --> 00:07:16.403
a safe country and
it is a clear message.

91
00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:18.303
What do we want?!

92
00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:19.223
Freedom!

93
00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:22.503
Nobody should ever doubt the resolve of

94
00:07:22.603 --> 00:07:25.923
this government to keep our borders secure.

95
00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:30.943
They won't be

96
00:07:31.043 --> 00:07:32.783
you know, numerate or literate

97
00:07:32.883 --> 00:07:35.123
in their own language, let alone English.

98
00:07:39.683 --> 00:07:42.863
Until now there has
been a long lengthy delay,

99
00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:46.263
there has been almost obsessive legal intervention

100
00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:48.863
to try and stop
people who are ill from

101
00:07:48.963 --> 00:07:50.663
being transferred over to Australia

102
00:07:50.763 --> 00:07:52.763
for the care that they need.

103
00:07:53.683 --> 00:07:54.863
This is going to be able

104
00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:58.063
to get spivs and rapists

105
00:07:58.163 --> 00:08:00.383
and murderers onto our shores.

106
00:08:00.483 --> 00:08:02.263
The bill says serious crimes

107
00:08:02.363 --> 00:08:03.983
would preclude that, that's wrong what you said,

108
00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:04.783
you admit that?

109
00:08:04.883 --> 00:08:06.623
What Labor says and what Labor...

110
00:08:06.723 --> 00:08:09.183
What the bill says. 
I'm sorry, you've got to be factual

111
00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:10.503
when you make the case.

112
00:08:10.603 --> 00:08:12.983
I will do everything in my power to

113
00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:16.143
ensure that these suggested changes that

114
00:08:16.243 --> 00:08:18.983
would undermine our border protection laws never see

115
00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:20.143
the light of day.

116
00:08:20.243 --> 00:08:22.223
You're suggesting that they're almost,
all of them are ill.

117
00:08:22.323 --> 00:08:25.183
The bottom line is Barry,
we're not prepared to weaken

118
00:08:25.283 --> 00:08:26.423
border protection like Labor is

119
00:08:26.523 --> 00:08:27.903
That's not the point,
can you explain to me

120
00:08:28.003 --> 00:08:30.783
how it is, that it's got
to the point where almost all of

121
00:08:30.883 --> 00:08:31.703
them are ill?

122
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.263
The point is Barry, we've stopped the boats.

123
00:08:34.362 --> 00:08:36.263
Because of temporary protection visas

124
00:08:36.362 --> 00:08:37.323
That's not an answer to that question

125
00:08:37.323 --> 00:08:39.223
because of... offshore...

126
00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:41.323
because of boat turn backs...

127
00:09:09.963 --> 00:09:13.163
Hello Craig, I'm walking in the corridor

128
00:09:14.323 --> 00:09:16.343
in the Park prison.

129
00:09:16.443 --> 00:09:19.243
It's a very proud moment of my life

130
00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:22.383
today, I'm gonna share with you.

131
00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:25.223
I'm gonna be free very soon

132
00:09:25.323 --> 00:09:28.323
I'm very excited and I just

133
00:09:29.163 --> 00:09:31.883
wanted to tell you that,
thank you very much for

134
00:09:33.243 --> 00:09:34.863
all your amazing support

135
00:09:34.963 --> 00:09:37.843
and thanks, all of you people.

136
00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:47.783
I cannot believe it

137
00:09:47.883 --> 00:09:49.023
I cannot.. yeah

138
00:09:49.123 --> 00:09:51.683
this morning I call you, 
I'm going to be free.

139
00:09:52.563 --> 00:09:54.563
Finally.

140
00:10:01.723 --> 00:10:03.463
My name is Farhad Bandesh

141
00:10:03.563 --> 00:10:05.703
I'm a Kurdish refugee.

142
00:10:05.803 --> 00:10:09.183
Seven and half years of my life

143
00:10:09.283 --> 00:10:12.223
I lost it for no reason.

144
00:10:12.323 --> 00:10:14.603
Fortunately with lots of

145
00:10:15.523 --> 00:10:18.263
support from Australian people,

146
00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:20.523
I got my freedom on my birthday.

147
00:10:39.323 --> 00:10:41.403
My name is Mostafa Azimitabar.

148
00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:46.283
I am 34 years old. 
I am a Kurdish refugee

149
00:10:46.643 --> 00:10:48.723
I was imprisoned,

150
00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:53.483
more than 2,700 days by the Australian government.

151
00:10:53.883 --> 00:10:57.203
This is the second
week in my life that

152
00:10:57.603 --> 00:11:00.543
I feel freedom.

153
00:11:00.643 --> 00:11:03.743
I haven't had freedom before in my life.

154
00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:05.943
So happy to see you out and free

155
00:11:06.043 --> 00:11:08.703
and with trees and grass and everything

156
00:11:08.803 --> 00:11:10.303
and Farhad as well,

157
00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.403
you look so well.

158
00:11:28.203 --> 00:11:31.343
So that was the
last song that you released.

159
00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:33.443
What was the name of it?

160
00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.423
How amazing...

161
00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:42.463
I remember the first time
I saw Moz was in

162
00:11:42.563 --> 00:11:44.563
Foxtrot, but

163
00:11:44.963 --> 00:11:47.183
we didn't know each other and I didn't

164
00:11:47.283 --> 00:11:50.503
try to connect it to him. But

165
00:11:50.603 --> 00:11:53.483
when I saw him playing guitar

166
00:11:54.163 --> 00:11:55.423
and

167
00:11:55.523 --> 00:11:58.983
thought wow, this guy is a musician.

168
00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:02.323
We become friends in Oscar compound.

169
00:12:04.243 --> 00:12:07.143
Yeah, I remember the first
time when I met Farhad,

170
00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:11.223
and he was drawing something and I really

171
00:12:11.323 --> 00:12:13.423
liked his painting

172
00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:15.523
and I started talking.

173
00:12:16.843 --> 00:12:18.843
And we became friends.

174
00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:22.123
I grew up in war.

175
00:13:23.243 --> 00:13:25.523
Even the first day when I was born

176
00:13:25.883 --> 00:13:28.363
the hail of bombs bombarded my city.

177
00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:31.803
It was the melody of my childhood.

178
00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:41.123
When I was child, we had really

179
00:13:42.283 --> 00:13:44.183
bad time because

180
00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:47.023
that time I was born in war

181
00:13:47.123 --> 00:13:50.203
I grow up with the
bombs, the sounds of the

182
00:13:50.683 --> 00:13:52.783
screaming of the people.

183
00:13:52.883 --> 00:13:55.583
We just run from the war.

184
00:13:55.683 --> 00:13:58.683
We went to the mountains,
we went to the forest.

185
00:13:59.483 --> 00:14:01.483
We were in tents,

186
00:14:02.283 --> 00:14:04.383
like thousand people

187
00:14:04.483 --> 00:14:07.463
they left from the city to get safety.

188
00:14:07.563 --> 00:14:12.423
We spend lots of time
without water, without bread or food,

189
00:14:12.523 --> 00:14:13.463
and I remember

190
00:14:13.563 --> 00:14:15.863
when the wind trembled the

191
00:14:15.963 --> 00:14:19.423
tree, oak tree, the sounds of dry oak

192
00:14:19.523 --> 00:14:22.843
from last year, that was kind of music.

193
00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:03.443
I saw the government

194
00:15:04.283 --> 00:15:07.183
are using a crane for hanging

195
00:15:07.283 --> 00:15:09.263
up people.

196
00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:11.063
They were not moving

197
00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:13.663
and I thought that they are dolls,

198
00:15:13.763 --> 00:15:15.543
and I asked

199
00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:19.243
the people who were
around me and they said

200
00:15:19.803 --> 00:15:21.543
that they are human beings and I said,

201
00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:23.343
but they are not moving and they said,

202
00:15:23.443 --> 00:15:25.443
because they are dead.

203
00:15:36.283 --> 00:15:37.303
Everything is dead

204
00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:39.503
the chickens, the birds,

205
00:15:39.603 --> 00:15:42.703
the, my mother

206
00:15:42.803 --> 00:15:45.663
and my father, with the
birds, with the chicken, with

207
00:15:45.763 --> 00:15:47.763
all of them dead.

208
00:15:49.523 --> 00:15:52.143
My family and I

209
00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.863
got traumatised because of the war.

210
00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:57.143
I lost my brother,

211
00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:59.663
he was killed when he was 15.

212
00:15:59.763 --> 00:16:00.743
I still hear the

213
00:16:00.843 --> 00:16:04.703
sound of crying of families

214
00:16:04.803 --> 00:16:07.783
and people because of losing their

215
00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:11.323
children and the members of their families.

216
00:16:13.843 --> 00:16:18.323
I learnt to be friends with my pain.

217
00:16:20.923 --> 00:16:23.043
They massacred us,

218
00:16:23.443 --> 00:16:24.983
they tortured us,

219
00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:27.103
they bombed at us.

220
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:30.363
They lined hundreds of Kurdish people in line

221
00:16:30.883 --> 00:16:35.083
and they didn't care how old they were,

222
00:16:35.683 --> 00:16:38.323
five years old boy, 10 years

223
00:16:38.763 --> 00:16:41.743
women, children, one by one they

224
00:16:41.843 --> 00:16:44.923
shoot and kill them

225
00:16:47.763 --> 00:16:50.043
There is no rights for people

226
00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:53.163
in the land that I grew up.

227
00:17:11.123 --> 00:17:13.783
I really knew that
if I wanted to go

228
00:17:13.883 --> 00:17:15.883
to Australia by boat,

229
00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:18.403
it's like 50%

230
00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:21.703
I can be alive, 50% I can be

231
00:17:21.803 --> 00:17:23.703
a dead person.

232
00:17:23.803 --> 00:17:26.743
But still I felt I have chance

233
00:17:26.843 --> 00:17:30.703
to be alive, because if I got deported

234
00:17:30.803 --> 00:17:32.623
definitely I would be in prison

235
00:17:32.723 --> 00:17:33.743
or killed

236
00:17:33.843 --> 00:17:35.743
in my homeland.

237
00:17:35.843 --> 00:17:37.843
I didn't know how to swim,

238
00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:41.403
I just try to be alive.

239
00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:48.703
I thought 27 years of torture was

240
00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:50.703
finished and I was supposed to

241
00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.043
start new life,

242
00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:55.783
but the Australian government

243
00:17:55.883 --> 00:17:58.403
started new life for me

244
00:17:59.403 --> 00:18:03.462
and make the horrible situation worse

245
00:18:03.563 --> 00:18:05.683
than the place that I grew up.

246
00:18:13.483 --> 00:18:16.183
When they exiled me
to Manus, the first day

247
00:18:16.283 --> 00:18:19.443
I remembered, we were kept in one room.

248
00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:23.763
120 people from different countries,

249
00:18:24.683 --> 00:18:26.623
different culture.

250
00:18:26.723 --> 00:18:28.723
Everything was dirty,

251
00:18:29.323 --> 00:18:31.323
the spiders

252
00:18:31.763 --> 00:18:33.703
painted the ceiling

253
00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:35.623
with cobwebs.

254
00:18:35.723 --> 00:18:37.723
120 people

255
00:18:38.603 --> 00:18:40.603
close to each other

256
00:18:40.923 --> 00:18:42.923
beside, shoulder by shoulder.

257
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.243
There was no space for breathing.

258
00:18:49.283 --> 00:18:51.303
It was a narrow

259
00:18:51.403 --> 00:18:55.483
way between the beds that the officers

260
00:18:57.283 --> 00:19:00.183
were walking among us.

261
00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:04.423
They called our numbers, KNS-88.

262
00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:06.523
It was my number.

263
00:19:11.403 --> 00:19:13.963
Many times, officers came to the rooms

264
00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:17.763
They smashed everything, they step on our belongings,

265
00:19:18.843 --> 00:19:20.843
they threw out everything

266
00:19:22.323 --> 00:19:24.323
A couple of times, they found

267
00:19:25.443 --> 00:19:29.283
phones, and then it would be very

268
00:19:30.523 --> 00:19:32.863
difficult time for us that

269
00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.303
they wanted to

270
00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:37.023
bully us that this is
a crime, you are not allowed

271
00:19:37.123 --> 00:19:39.123
to have phones.

272
00:19:44.203 --> 00:19:46.223
I had huge insomnia

273
00:19:46.323 --> 00:19:47.983
when I was on Manus.

274
00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.703
I couldn't sleep at all,

275
00:19:49.803 --> 00:19:51.863
sometimes two hours a day,

276
00:19:51.963 --> 00:19:54.523
sometimes three hours a day,

277
00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:56.983
was my sleeping

278
00:19:57.083 --> 00:20:00.203
and every day I had nightmares.

279
00:20:00.883 --> 00:20:04.603
Nightmares were a part of detention.

280
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:09.223
We went to the mess to eat

281
00:20:09.323 --> 00:20:11.503
lunch and dinner or breakfast.

282
00:20:11.603 --> 00:20:14.723
500 people in small space

283
00:20:17.163 --> 00:20:19.303
wanna eat something.

284
00:20:19.403 --> 00:20:22.463
It's very hot, it's 45 degrees.

285
00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:25.743
Why do we have
to be in this line

286
00:20:25.843 --> 00:20:27.743
for hours and hours?

287
00:20:27.843 --> 00:20:32.183
The last 100 refugees who were

288
00:20:32.283 --> 00:20:34.563
on the line couldn't get anything.

289
00:20:35.523 --> 00:20:39.323
This situation made us so unwell.

290
00:20:41.123 --> 00:20:44.643
I could hear the
complaining of refugees every day.

291
00:20:45.443 --> 00:20:48.003
Some of them have a stomachache, headaches,

292
00:20:48.883 --> 00:20:52.183
kidney pain, lots of different pains

293
00:20:52.283 --> 00:20:55.603
and the only solution for us was

294
00:20:56.203 --> 00:20:58.443
drinking water and Panadol.

295
00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:02.063
I went to

296
00:21:02.163 --> 00:21:04.023
see a nurse

297
00:21:04.123 --> 00:21:05.183
and

298
00:21:05.283 --> 00:21:07.063
she told me that have you thought about

299
00:21:07.163 --> 00:21:09.163
going back to your country?

300
00:21:09.803 --> 00:21:12.363
And I said that
I have a stomach ache.

301
00:21:13.683 --> 00:21:15.683
I need you to help me.

302
00:21:17.603 --> 00:21:21.383
And she said that, 
I prescribe Panadol.

303
00:21:21.483 --> 00:21:23.583
Whenever I heard about Panadol,

304
00:21:23.683 --> 00:21:25.903
I thought that they are just

305
00:21:26.003 --> 00:21:28.003
making fun of us.

306
00:21:28.883 --> 00:21:30.183
They wanted

307
00:21:30.283 --> 00:21:33.763
to continue this torture in order to

308
00:21:35.483 --> 00:21:37.483
target our resistance

309
00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:42.483
and we give up and
we get back to our countries.

310
00:21:45.563 --> 00:21:47.563
The sadness will remain

311
00:21:48.243 --> 00:21:50.303
in Australia,

312
00:21:50.403 --> 00:21:51.623
they cannot

313
00:21:51.723 --> 00:21:52.903
clear

314
00:21:53.003 --> 00:21:53.903
this sadness,

315
00:21:54.003 --> 00:21:56.963
it is a part of this society now.

316
00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:13.983
The most difficult part in detention was

317
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:17.643
the time that the government left us alone

318
00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:20.023
behind the fences

319
00:22:20.123 --> 00:22:22.123
without any

320
00:22:22.483 --> 00:22:25.883
food, water, security, power, nothing.

321
00:22:27.123 --> 00:22:29.583
A couple of hours ago, 
PNG police with

322
00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:33.223
(inaudible) officers came inside
the compound and threw out

323
00:22:33.323 --> 00:22:35.323
our remaining water.

324
00:22:39.043 --> 00:22:41.803
PNG immigration and PNG police,

325
00:22:42.563 --> 00:22:45.423
and the Navy, they demolished everything.

326
00:22:45.523 --> 00:22:48.863
They are hitting us, they beat us,

327
00:22:48.963 --> 00:22:51.543
so now they want to kill us,

328
00:22:51.643 --> 00:22:56.283
we don't know what
to do, we need help.

329
00:22:57.003 --> 00:22:59.423
After 24 days,

330
00:22:59.523 --> 00:23:02.483
a group of like, a cattle of robots

331
00:23:03.203 --> 00:23:05.503
came to the detention

332
00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:08.263
and they wanted to

333
00:23:08.363 --> 00:23:11.183
move us to another place by force.

334
00:23:11.283 --> 00:23:13.143
We were sitting

335
00:23:13.243 --> 00:23:14.303
on the ground

336
00:23:14.403 --> 00:23:16.563
like the way that
I am talking with you,

337
00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:17.983
very peaceful,

338
00:23:18.083 --> 00:23:20.083
we didn't say any words.

339
00:23:20.963 --> 00:23:23.363
They started stoning at us,

340
00:23:23.923 --> 00:23:26.183
they started beating us with

341
00:23:26.283 --> 00:23:27.663
iron bars,

342
00:23:27.763 --> 00:23:30.363
lots of police were around us.

343
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.243
One of the police beat my shoulder

344
00:23:42.803 --> 00:23:44.883
with an iron bar. After

345
00:23:46.443 --> 00:23:48.443
a couple of days, 
I got a stammer.

346
00:23:50.323 --> 00:23:53.863
I still have the stammer

347
00:23:53.963 --> 00:23:57.983
but I know how to control it. It's

348
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.823
very difficult.

349
00:23:59.923 --> 00:24:01.823
I don't know, how can I

350
00:24:01.923 --> 00:24:04.443
forget those memories, it comes to me.

351
00:24:14.843 --> 00:24:17.783
After spending some time
working on a campaign for

352
00:24:17.883 --> 00:24:20.623
another refugee, a young sporting refugee.

353
00:24:20.723 --> 00:24:23.843
I decided to go across
to Port Morseby to meet

354
00:24:24.163 --> 00:24:27.683
many of the men who'd been imprisoned on

355
00:24:28.483 --> 00:24:30.483
Manus Island.

356
00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.523
One of those was Mostafa,

357
00:24:34.323 --> 00:24:36.423
he was emaciated,

358
00:24:36.523 --> 00:24:37.863
he

359
00:24:37.963 --> 00:24:39.783
was constantly coughing.

360
00:24:39.883 --> 00:24:41.783
Why are we torturing this person?

361
00:24:41.883 --> 00:24:43.663
Australia has been told these

362
00:24:43.763 --> 00:24:47.303
things about them and I'm
sitting in front of this young

363
00:24:47.403 --> 00:24:49.103
man who we've ripped eight years of his

364
00:24:49.203 --> 00:24:53.043
life away improperly, and he couldn't be more

365
00:24:53.483 --> 00:24:55.343
lovely, he couldn't be more gentle,

366
00:24:55.443 --> 00:24:57.443
he couldn't be more welcoming.

367
00:24:58.683 --> 00:25:00.863
And I asked him if
he would play his song

368
00:25:00.963 --> 00:25:03.703
and he started to play and sing beautifully

369
00:25:03.803 --> 00:25:06.983
and just as he was coming
to the key line in the chorus,

370
00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:09.083
he broke down coughing.

371
00:25:09.563 --> 00:25:12.383
And you know, this coughing fit

372
00:25:12.483 --> 00:25:15.263
went on forever and I
just sat there, you know

373
00:25:15.363 --> 00:25:18.903
embarrassed thinking, wow, you
know, this guy is physically

374
00:25:19.003 --> 00:25:21.283
just broken.

375
00:25:22.683 --> 00:25:24.763
Music, I

376
00:25:25.363 --> 00:25:27.363
sometimes play.

377
00:25:27.763 --> 00:25:31.143
These days, it's very difficult

378
00:25:31.243 --> 00:25:33.063
because asthma is killing me.

379
00:25:33.163 --> 00:25:36.383
I don't know how I can survive,

380
00:25:36.483 --> 00:25:39.323
sometimes I feel I am not alive.

381
00:26:46.523 --> 00:26:49.143
When they exiled me

382
00:26:49.243 --> 00:26:51.283
and others to Manus Island,

383
00:26:52.643 --> 00:26:54.643
the feeling was really

384
00:26:55.603 --> 00:26:58.823
sad when I saw this

385
00:26:58.923 --> 00:27:01.083
small island, it's a

386
00:27:02.163 --> 00:27:04.103
remote island actually,

387
00:27:04.203 --> 00:27:06.203
so we trapped

388
00:27:06.563 --> 00:27:08.463
forever.

389
00:27:08.563 --> 00:27:11.103
There is only two seasons in Manus Island,

390
00:27:11.203 --> 00:27:13.223
it's hot and wet,

391
00:27:13.323 --> 00:27:15.403
and you get a sweat every day,

392
00:27:15.803 --> 00:27:18.123
every day, every night, you couldn't sleep

393
00:27:18.643 --> 00:27:21.843
your body, your mind is shocked.

394
00:27:27.523 --> 00:27:28.943
Their treatment

395
00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:32.363
of us was degrading.

396
00:27:33.283 --> 00:27:35.743
They humiliated us

397
00:27:35.843 --> 00:27:37.943
every single day for years.

398
00:27:38.043 --> 00:27:40.243
You should go back
to your country, non refugee.

399
00:27:42.923 --> 00:27:46.543
Many of them they come to me and

400
00:27:46.643 --> 00:27:49.763
always I encouraged them: be strong.

401
00:27:50.163 --> 00:27:52.163
There is something inside you,

402
00:27:53.283 --> 00:27:55.283
you need to find it.

403
00:27:59.243 --> 00:28:02.223
From one detention to another detention.

404
00:28:02.323 --> 00:28:03.623
From one country

405
00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:04.823
to another country,

406
00:28:04.923 --> 00:28:07.403
from one prison to another prison

407
00:28:07.843 --> 00:28:08.583
for the government,

408
00:28:08.683 --> 00:28:10.683
we were just human cargo.

409
00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:14.943
I came 2019 to Australia

410
00:28:15.043 --> 00:28:18.283
for medical treatment under Medevac bill.

411
00:28:23.483 --> 00:28:26.443
There wasn't any fresh air, sunshine

412
00:28:28.283 --> 00:28:31.503
For three months I
had to fight for this

413
00:28:31.603 --> 00:28:34.603
basic human right.

414
00:28:35.443 --> 00:28:37.583
Finally they opened the

415
00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:39.683
window this size.

416
00:28:41.563 --> 00:28:44.823
I was kept in
the Mantra and Park prisons

417
00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:47.163
for approximately 15 months.

418
00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:49.983
My life was a room and a

419
00:28:50.083 --> 00:28:51.943
narrow corridor.

420
00:28:52.043 --> 00:28:54.043
23 hours a day I was

421
00:28:54.763 --> 00:28:56.863
locked up in a room.

422
00:28:56.963 --> 00:28:59.303
I got a terrible PTSD

423
00:28:59.403 --> 00:29:01.103
from Manus.

424
00:29:01.203 --> 00:29:03.203
I don't like

425
00:29:04.363 --> 00:29:08.363
any people like police officers,

426
00:29:10.443 --> 00:29:12.663
come and touch my body. The officers

427
00:29:12.763 --> 00:29:15.123
in the Mantra prison and

428
00:29:15.923 --> 00:29:18.823
the park prison, they did pat searched my

429
00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:21.203
body more than 400 times.

430
00:29:21.963 --> 00:29:24.143
Guard: Like we said just
a pat down search mate.

431
00:29:24.243 --> 00:29:26.383
Guard: You understand that no problems?

432
00:29:26.483 --> 00:29:28.563
Well, I just talked with

433
00:29:29.363 --> 00:29:32.463
them that I don't like to
have pat search, but because I

434
00:29:32.563 --> 00:29:34.023
have to visit my friends.

435
00:29:34.123 --> 00:29:36.123
Guard: Yep

436
00:29:36.843 --> 00:29:38.703
Guard: It's part of the
procedure, hop around for me,

437
00:29:38.803 --> 00:29:39.343
I know

438
00:29:39.443 --> 00:29:41.663
no hands sure, but
I will take the video

439
00:29:41.763 --> 00:29:42.443
Guard: Do whatever you want

440
00:29:42.443 --> 00:29:43.263
na.. na.. na

441
00:29:43.363 --> 00:29:44.523
Guard: I tell you what guys, 
I tell you what guys

442
00:29:44.523 --> 00:29:46.603
Guard: We will take him to escort

443
00:29:47.283 --> 00:29:49.063
Guard: We'll take him

444
00:29:49.163 --> 00:29:54.363
Guard: That's fine. 
That's fine, we'll take him.

445
00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.143
Guard: Can you just put
you hands on the wall

446
00:30:14.243 --> 00:30:17.303
Guard: like this, and you
just take one shoe off

447
00:30:17.403 --> 00:30:18.463
Guard: show me the bottom of your feet.

448
00:30:18.563 --> 00:30:20.223
I don't want to take off my shoes

449
00:30:20.323 --> 00:30:21.663
Guard: You don't have to
put your feet on the floor.

450
00:30:21.763 --> 00:30:23.823
Guard: I need to see underneath your feet.

451
00:30:23.923 --> 00:30:25.923
Guard: Just put like this.

452
00:30:26.403 --> 00:30:29.503
They treat us like we are nothing.

453
00:30:29.603 --> 00:30:32.303
Even wild animal has rights,

454
00:30:32.403 --> 00:30:35.123
even criminals has rights,

455
00:30:36.123 --> 00:30:38.123
what about a refugee?

456
00:30:55.083 --> 00:30:57.903
Among all chaotic situation,

457
00:30:58.003 --> 00:31:00.003
lot's of torture

458
00:31:01.403 --> 00:31:03.503
lack of

459
00:31:03.603 --> 00:31:05.603
humanity...

460
00:31:06.883 --> 00:31:09.263
The behavior of officers over there,

461
00:31:09.363 --> 00:31:11.263
those things were horrible.

462
00:31:11.363 --> 00:31:13.603
I just try to find

463
00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:18.083
tranquility for myself.

464
00:31:18.923 --> 00:31:21.763
I try to be kind to myself.

465
00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:24.743
Art helped me

466
00:31:24.843 --> 00:31:26.943
to continue.

467
00:31:27.043 --> 00:31:29.163
Art helped me to be strong.

468
00:31:48.443 --> 00:31:49.223
I didn't want

469
00:31:49.323 --> 00:31:52.763
to escape, I wanted
to fight in this situation.

470
00:31:53.323 --> 00:31:55.323
No, you cannot escape from the

471
00:31:56.043 --> 00:31:59.703
situation when you are there,
but you can be there and

472
00:31:59.803 --> 00:32:01.223
fight.

473
00:32:01.323 --> 00:32:02.103
It's like battle,

474
00:32:02.203 --> 00:32:05.003
always I say, this is a
battle, you need to fight for it.

475
00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:07.763
If you escape. 
It means you want to

476
00:32:08.803 --> 00:32:11.203
cover your eyes, you cannot see it, but

477
00:32:12.723 --> 00:32:15.223
I was carrying the pain with myself and

478
00:32:15.323 --> 00:32:17.423
at the same time,

479
00:32:17.523 --> 00:32:20.363
I fight with my art against this cruelty.

480
00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:29.583
Always, art, music

481
00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:31.143
it's part of my resistance.

482
00:32:31.243 --> 00:32:35.283
Without those I couldn't really survive.

483
00:32:44.443 --> 00:32:46.443
I think painting is

484
00:32:48.203 --> 00:32:51.703
a kind of friend for my soul.

485
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.623
When I was in detention, it took me

486
00:32:54.723 --> 00:32:56.583
to freedom,

487
00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:58.883
it took my soul to freedom.

488
00:33:06.803 --> 00:33:07.703
Imagine for

489
00:33:07.803 --> 00:33:12.843
eight years, every day, immigration, case managers,

490
00:33:13.483 --> 00:33:15.103
security officers,

491
00:33:15.203 --> 00:33:17.203
you cannot come to Australia.

492
00:33:17.763 --> 00:33:20.603
I accepted in my

493
00:33:21.163 --> 00:33:23.163
soul that it's my life,

494
00:33:24.123 --> 00:33:27.403
I know that, outside this place,

495
00:33:28.643 --> 00:33:30.643
people have normal lives

496
00:33:31.323 --> 00:33:33.323
but also

497
00:33:34.123 --> 00:33:37.503
I should understand that, this is my life,

498
00:33:37.603 --> 00:33:38.823
I'm not gonna be free

499
00:33:38.923 --> 00:33:41.683
but also, I don't want to give up.

500
00:33:44.003 --> 00:33:46.003
So every time

501
00:33:47.163 --> 00:33:49.843
I talk to myself, it will be okay.

502
00:33:51.883 --> 00:33:54.023
It's all

503
00:33:54.123 --> 00:33:56.223
nightmares

504
00:33:56.323 --> 00:33:59.223
I don't know when it's gonna be

505
00:33:59.323 --> 00:34:01.883
my day, but one
day will be my day.

506
00:34:04.363 --> 00:34:06.363
And I'll be free.

507
00:35:00.602 --> 00:35:02.602
Wine in Kurdish

508
00:35:03.683 --> 00:35:05.683
culture has a meaning.

509
00:35:06.363 --> 00:35:09.163
I think it's kind of sharing love.

510
00:35:10.043 --> 00:35:13.043
You have a bottle of wine
you want to share with friends,

511
00:35:13.643 --> 00:35:15.883
which means brings everyone together.

512
00:35:16.843 --> 00:35:19.563
And you want to
share the happiness with wine.

513
00:35:24.683 --> 00:35:26.263
In Kurdistan

514
00:35:26.363 --> 00:35:29.543
it's not allowed but many people they

515
00:35:29.643 --> 00:35:32.663
make it from home
and they drink it secretly.

516
00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:35.563
You cannot drink it in public.

517
00:35:36.243 --> 00:35:38.263
I remember when I make wine,

518
00:35:38.363 --> 00:35:39.423
I call my friends...

519
00:35:39.523 --> 00:35:42.163
I have some wine, 
I can share it with you.

520
00:35:55.483 --> 00:35:57.463
It's so exciting.

521
00:35:57.563 --> 00:35:59.563
This is the first

522
00:36:00.563 --> 00:36:03.523
wine I am making

523
00:36:04.843 --> 00:36:06.843
in Australia.

524
00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:13.103
Today we're gonna press

525
00:36:13.203 --> 00:36:15.883
"Time to Fly" shiraz wine

526
00:36:18.323 --> 00:36:20.863
and I just taste it

527
00:36:20.963 --> 00:36:24.863
I'm very happy with it. 
The tannins and

528
00:36:24.963 --> 00:36:29.263
flavour. It's nice and it's

529
00:36:29.363 --> 00:36:31.563
about 70 days now,

530
00:36:33.963 --> 00:36:35.103
the fermentation.

531
00:36:35.203 --> 00:36:37.963
Time to Fly, means...

532
00:36:38.603 --> 00:36:41.303
time to fly! You need to be free

533
00:36:41.403 --> 00:36:44.283
and this design

534
00:36:45.043 --> 00:36:48.723
it's about when I was on Manus Island,

535
00:36:49.883 --> 00:36:52.523
it's gonna be surprise for

536
00:36:53.363 --> 00:36:56.523
first for my family and my friends

537
00:36:58.643 --> 00:37:01.383
and I would love
to share this wine with

538
00:37:01.483 --> 00:37:03.483
Australian people.

539
00:37:07.083 --> 00:37:11.163
In Kurdistan, in Iran side

540
00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.903
you are not allowed even to

541
00:37:15.003 --> 00:37:17.123
write in your language.

542
00:37:18.203 --> 00:37:20.683
And you cannot practice your culture,

543
00:37:21.443 --> 00:37:24.603
and even you cannot talk about your history.

544
00:37:25.803 --> 00:37:29.343
and if you go to a
school, you cannot talk in your language,

545
00:37:29.443 --> 00:37:32.843
not Kurdish. Not your mother tongue,

546
00:37:33.603 --> 00:37:35.683
And we are Indigenous there.

547
00:37:36.563 --> 00:37:38.903
We are the owner of that land

548
00:37:39.003 --> 00:37:42.383
and we cannot raise our flag and say,

549
00:37:42.483 --> 00:37:46.083
we are here for
thousands and thousands of years.

550
00:37:49.803 --> 00:37:50.823
Congratulations!

551
00:37:50.923 --> 00:37:52.583
Thank you, cheers

552
00:37:52.683 --> 00:37:55.923
I hope it's.. it's
a long way to go

553
00:37:56.883 --> 00:38:00.343
before you got to sell it, but

554
00:38:00.443 --> 00:38:02.523
a lot of water's gone under the bridge.

555
00:38:03.163 --> 00:38:07.423
to get here. How do you feel?

556
00:38:07.523 --> 00:38:09.843
Yeah, I feel

557
00:38:10.363 --> 00:38:11.103
so excited.

558
00:38:11.203 --> 00:38:13.203
Imagine how you gonna feel
when it goes to bottle!

559
00:38:14.523 --> 00:38:16.683
I cannot wait.

560
00:38:18.283 --> 00:38:19.783
Then the headaches begin.

561
00:38:19.883 --> 00:38:22.023
The making it's the easy part.

562
00:38:22.123 --> 00:38:24.383
Yeah, actually with

563
00:38:24.483 --> 00:38:26.483
your support.

564
00:38:28.363 --> 00:38:29.903
There are some good people around.

565
00:38:30.003 --> 00:38:32.003
Yeah, always

566
00:38:32.563 --> 00:38:33.703
Thank you.

567
00:38:33.803 --> 00:38:34.943
Well, here's to you.

568
00:38:35.043 --> 00:38:36.223
Thank you. Cheers.

569
00:38:36.323 --> 00:38:37.263
Amazing journey.

570
00:38:37.363 --> 00:38:38.463
Yeah.

571
00:38:38.563 --> 00:38:40.563
Thanks

572
00:39:01.123 --> 00:39:02.423
Good

573
00:39:02.523 --> 00:39:04.983
I'm really happy to see you

574
00:39:05.083 --> 00:39:07.483
you're still strong, I like it

575
00:39:08.883 --> 00:39:11.083
I'm trying bro, 
I'm still trying

576
00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:12.263
Yeah

577
00:39:12.363 --> 00:39:14.443
But it's hard, very hard time

578
00:39:24.003 --> 00:39:26.003
You didn't do anything wrong

579
00:39:26.723 --> 00:39:29.643
You're just looking for safety and your freedom

580
00:39:32.043 --> 00:39:34.043
You are a good man.

581
00:40:11.443 --> 00:40:13.443
I know I understand

582
00:40:37.163 --> 00:40:39.203
That's what we need from you

583
00:40:45.123 --> 00:40:47.123
Thank you buddy

584
00:40:58.563 --> 00:41:00.563
Thank you, be strong

585
00:41:03.323 --> 00:41:05.423
I love you bro

586
00:41:05.523 --> 00:41:07.263
I need you

587
00:41:07.363 --> 00:41:10.123
to have the biggest smile, always

588
00:41:11.243 --> 00:41:13.023
Yes, that's the face

589
00:41:13.123 --> 00:41:15.123
That's the resistance

590
00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:18.403
That's the way you fight for your freedom

591
00:41:20.163 --> 00:41:21.183
Thank you

592
00:41:21.283 --> 00:41:23.463
Thank you

593
00:41:23.563 --> 00:41:24.503
Have a good night

594
00:41:24.603 --> 00:41:26.603
see ya

595
00:41:27.763 --> 00:41:29.183
Love you

596
00:41:29.283 --> 00:41:31.283
see ya

597
00:42:55.723 --> 00:42:59.423
So they're caught in this interminable hell

598
00:42:59.523 --> 00:43:01.623
where all of these things

599
00:43:01.723 --> 00:43:06.623
are set up in order to, to terrorise

600
00:43:06.723 --> 00:43:07.903
them so much that they

601
00:43:08.003 --> 00:43:10.863
basically give up either
on life, or give up

602
00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:13.783
on trying to find refuge.

603
00:43:13.883 --> 00:43:15.063
Just imagine that

604
00:43:15.163 --> 00:43:16.823
from an Australian perspective for a moment.

605
00:43:16.923 --> 00:43:18.463
The most vulnerable people in the world

606
00:43:18.563 --> 00:43:19.983
have to actually flee, have been

607
00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:22.863
proven to have fled persecution, which means

608
00:43:22.963 --> 00:43:25.803
imprisonment, attacks, death.

609
00:43:26.923 --> 00:43:29.103
And we've treated them so badly,

610
00:43:29.203 --> 00:43:32.723
that actually some of them ultimately decide,

611
00:43:34.123 --> 00:43:36.103
I'll just take my chances

612
00:43:36.203 --> 00:43:38.143
with my own government back home,

613
00:43:38.243 --> 00:43:40.243
which means I likely to lose my life

614
00:43:40.883 --> 00:43:44.223
but if I stay here
it's gone anyway. That's the

615
00:43:44.323 --> 00:43:47.243
bargain that we try to strike with them.

616
00:43:49.843 --> 00:43:53.903
The way we treat
the most vulnerable infects all

617
00:43:54.003 --> 00:43:56.423
of our view of who we are

618
00:43:56.523 --> 00:43:58.623
and how we treat each other.

619
00:43:58.723 --> 00:44:01.023
If we were to become,

620
00:44:01.123 --> 00:44:03.243
and should be, a country where we say:

621
00:44:04.123 --> 00:44:06.423
we are going to treat everyone

622
00:44:06.523 --> 00:44:09.023
with basic standards of decency.

623
00:44:09.123 --> 00:44:12.203
When we do that as
a country, everyone is uplifted,

624
00:44:13.123 --> 00:44:16.743
everyone is more hopeful, everyone becomes

625
00:44:16.843 --> 00:44:18.943
more caring, more considerate

626
00:44:19.043 --> 00:44:21.243
and isn't that what
society is supposed to be?

627
00:44:49.523 --> 00:44:51.863
I was in prison more than

628
00:44:51.963 --> 00:44:54.063
2,700 days by the

629
00:44:54.163 --> 00:44:56.983
Australian government but my message

630
00:44:57.083 --> 00:44:59.743
to you wonderful people is love,

631
00:44:59.843 --> 00:45:01.843
and I believe that love

632
00:45:02.683 --> 00:45:05.763
is the answer. 
This is the way that we can

633
00:45:06.243 --> 00:45:08.243
kill the monsters.

634
00:45:13.843 --> 00:45:16.763
I am asking you
to listen to your heart

635
00:45:17.203 --> 00:45:19.383
so that together, we can

636
00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:22.463
create a wave of
change that will tear down

637
00:45:22.563 --> 00:45:25.583
the walls of the Park prison and other

638
00:45:25.683 --> 00:45:28.463
detention centres and free our brothers

639
00:45:28.563 --> 00:45:30.563
and sisters.

640
00:45:38.803 --> 00:45:39.943
Still there

641
00:45:40.043 --> 00:45:42.363
are many behind the fences.

642
00:45:43.563 --> 00:45:45.563
They haven't committed any crime.

643
00:45:45.963 --> 00:45:48.063
It doesn't make sense. 
They should be free.

644
00:45:48.163 --> 00:45:51.183
No children should be behind the fences.

645
00:45:51.283 --> 00:45:53.463
No any women

646
00:45:53.563 --> 00:45:56.463
should be behind their fences. 
They are not criminals.

647
00:45:56.563 --> 00:46:00.383
The government spent billions of dollars

648
00:46:00.483 --> 00:46:02.943
to keep them inside the detention

649
00:46:03.043 --> 00:46:05.743
and separate them from the society and

650
00:46:05.843 --> 00:46:08.303
the government want to show that,

651
00:46:08.403 --> 00:46:11.763
these people are bad, these people are good,

652
00:46:12.843 --> 00:46:16.363
refugees are dangerous, Aboriginal

653
00:46:16.963 --> 00:46:19.363
different, they just want to separate

654
00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:22.183
and create

655
00:46:22.283 --> 00:46:24.523
layer of discrimination.

656
00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:34.183
When people get depressed, when

657
00:46:34.283 --> 00:46:36.143
they want to kill themselves,

658
00:46:36.243 --> 00:46:38.243
when they want to harm themselves,

659
00:46:39.203 --> 00:46:40.863
they think that they are alone.

660
00:46:40.963 --> 00:46:42.743
It's like a responsibility

661
00:46:42.843 --> 00:46:44.843
for everyone that

662
00:46:45.563 --> 00:46:47.683
help vulnerable people

663
00:46:48.203 --> 00:46:49.783
to be strong

664
00:46:49.883 --> 00:46:51.263
and show them that

665
00:46:51.363 --> 00:46:52.783
they are not alone.

666
00:46:52.883 --> 00:46:55.763
You helped me, to

667
00:46:56.723 --> 00:46:59.883
get the voice and and
send it to people in Australia.

668
00:47:01.163 --> 00:47:04.583
You gave me power, 
I felt that this is

669
00:47:04.683 --> 00:47:07.543
something that I have
to keep it for everyone,

670
00:47:07.643 --> 00:47:09.623
it's not for me, it's for everyone.

671
00:47:09.723 --> 00:47:13.603
The more I got tortured from the government,

672
00:47:13.963 --> 00:47:17.123
the more I became
friends with people in Australia.

673
00:47:19.243 --> 00:47:21.223
A big part of

674
00:47:21.323 --> 00:47:24.283
my resilience and the way I got

675
00:47:25.163 --> 00:47:28.323
free is absolutely because of people in Australia.

676
00:47:29.123 --> 00:47:31.123
And now

677
00:47:31.603 --> 00:47:33.923
I have a big family.

678
00:47:48.443 --> 00:47:51.243
It makes me so happy.

679
00:47:52.243 --> 00:47:52.583
Hello!

680
00:47:52.683 --> 00:47:54.263
Oh, it is you

681
00:47:54.363 --> 00:47:56.483
It is, It is, It is.

682
00:47:57.563 --> 00:47:58.223
Oh.

683
00:47:58.323 --> 00:47:59.143
Hello!

684
00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:00.863
This is magic

685
00:48:00.963 --> 00:48:03.923
This is absolute magic

686
00:48:04.843 --> 00:48:06.843
I can't believe it.

687
00:48:08.163 --> 00:48:10.163
Oh my darling,

688
00:48:11.523 --> 00:48:14.483
oh, my precious boys

689
00:48:14.923 --> 00:48:16.743
wonderful

690
00:48:16.843 --> 00:48:19.643
and now I see you free!

691
00:48:24.323 --> 00:48:26.323
I cannot believe it.

692
00:48:26.723 --> 00:48:29.243
You are my first Australian friend.

693
00:48:30.163 --> 00:48:31.983
You are very kind

694
00:48:32.083 --> 00:48:33.223
amazing.

695
00:48:33.323 --> 00:48:35.323
Wonderful.

696
00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:39.343
If you remember my English
was poor on Manus Island.

697
00:48:39.443 --> 00:48:41.343
I asked you to help me with English

698
00:48:41.443 --> 00:48:43.743
I had to rewrite your poems.

699
00:48:43.843 --> 00:48:45.303
Yes

700
00:48:45.403 --> 00:48:46.943
It was all about poetry.

701
00:48:47.043 --> 00:48:49.723
I've got a book here somewhere

702
00:48:50.283 --> 00:48:53.343
here, with

703
00:48:53.443 --> 00:48:56.503
me trying to learn your language.

704
00:48:56.603 --> 00:48:58.503
Wow

705
00:48:58.603 --> 00:48:59.463
Kurdish language

706
00:48:59.563 --> 00:49:02.183
Wow.

707
00:49:02.283 --> 00:49:03.063
Yes, it's

708
00:49:03.163 --> 00:49:04.463
all your poetry's in here,

709
00:49:04.563 --> 00:49:07.223
your very first poems in this little book.

710
00:49:07.323 --> 00:49:10.563
Yes, its the most
extraordinary thing to come across,

711
00:49:11.443 --> 00:49:13.343
these

712
00:49:13.443 --> 00:49:16.083
young men who have been through hell,

713
00:49:17.443 --> 00:49:21.283
suddenly appearing and being real people.

714
00:49:22.563 --> 00:49:26.203
Yes, just beautiful, wonderful thing to

715
00:49:27.403 --> 00:49:29.343
make that connection

716
00:49:29.443 --> 00:49:33.563
Yeah, very deciding thing in life

717
00:49:34.243 --> 00:49:37.023
of what your values
are when something like this

718
00:49:37.123 --> 00:49:39.123
comes and hits you.

719
00:49:40.363 --> 00:49:43.243
You've got to get
in there and do something.

720
00:49:47.763 --> 00:49:49.863
Thank you for all your support

721
00:49:49.963 --> 00:49:52.443
and all your activism for

722
00:49:53.243 --> 00:49:55.143
all of us. Thank you.

723
00:49:55.243 --> 00:49:57.563
Well, you're very, very, very welcome.

724
00:49:59.003 --> 00:50:01.103
You keep collecting my poetry

725
00:50:01.203 --> 00:50:02.903
oh my god

726
00:50:03.003 --> 00:50:05.663
Yeah, I'm honoured to be that person

727
00:50:05.763 --> 00:50:08.263
to publish your poems one day.

728
00:50:08.363 --> 00:50:11.063
Well, if you do it and
I don't do it, that's okay,

729
00:50:11.163 --> 00:50:13.023
I'm just never going to do it myself.

730
00:50:13.123 --> 00:50:15.123
I love your poems, that's why

731
00:50:16.163 --> 00:50:18.963
and of course you are beautiful, kind

732
00:50:19.723 --> 00:50:21.343
and you help me

733
00:50:21.443 --> 00:50:23.443
a lot.

734
00:50:26.363 --> 00:50:28.903
The first poem written by Farhad Bandesh

735
00:50:29.003 --> 00:50:31.003
in 2015.

736
00:50:33.763 --> 00:50:35.903
He wrote it after finding me on Facebook.

737
00:50:36.003 --> 00:50:39.103
All his creative skills came into play

738
00:50:39.203 --> 00:50:42.283
and kept him mentally and spiritually healthy.

739
00:50:45.883 --> 00:50:47.883
"Silence of Nature"

740
00:50:51.483 --> 00:50:53.183
That was a powerful poem you wrote.

741
00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:54.623
Thank you.

742
00:50:54.723 --> 00:50:57.543
Was it the first poem
you ever wrote at all?

743
00:50:57.643 --> 00:51:01.023
Yeah, that's the first, I couldn't

744
00:51:01.123 --> 00:51:03.063
believe it, you said
no, this is a good,

745
00:51:03.163 --> 00:51:04.463
this is a good one.

746
00:51:04.563 --> 00:51:06.683
this is a poem.

747
00:51:07.283 --> 00:51:09.183
Well, do you know the words you said

748
00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:12.243
that struck me most deeply

749
00:51:12.643 --> 00:51:15.423
were the two words, "woven oppression".

750
00:51:15.523 --> 00:51:17.503
Yeah.

751
00:51:17.603 --> 00:51:20.003
That was fantastically original

752
00:51:21.443 --> 00:51:24.663
I'd never seen, oppression woven before,

753
00:51:24.763 --> 00:51:26.663
but it was it was woven through

754
00:51:26.763 --> 00:51:28.183
you all.

755
00:51:28.283 --> 00:51:31.263
Woven into your blood, woven into your

756
00:51:31.363 --> 00:51:32.703
brains,

757
00:51:32.803 --> 00:51:34.803
deliberately.

758
00:51:36.283 --> 00:51:40.383
God that describes what was
done to you all so deeply

759
00:51:40.483 --> 00:51:42.483
and so well.

760
00:51:44.003 --> 00:51:45.263
Yeah.

761
00:51:45.363 --> 00:51:49.383
It was just an extremely important experience

762
00:51:49.483 --> 00:51:51.663
of knowing what

763
00:51:51.763 --> 00:51:54.443
lack of freedom does to a human being.

764
00:51:55.163 --> 00:51:57.283
The utter cruelty of it.

765
00:52:18.003 --> 00:52:20.463
It was today, last year

766
00:52:20.563 --> 00:52:21.943
one year ago.

767
00:52:22.043 --> 00:52:24.403
How is the feeling now, compared to then?

768
00:52:28.803 --> 00:52:30.503
I think

769
00:52:30.603 --> 00:52:32.603
it's perfect

770
00:52:33.443 --> 00:52:35.443
It was like a nightmare

771
00:52:36.883 --> 00:52:38.583
everything is beautiful

772
00:52:38.683 --> 00:52:42.923
I couldn't see any kind of flower or

773
00:52:43.283 --> 00:52:45.143
trees.

774
00:52:45.243 --> 00:52:48.283
Now I can see everything.

775
00:53:11.243 --> 00:53:14.703
The first time I talked with Christina was

776
00:53:14.803 --> 00:53:17.703
a week after the seige

777
00:53:17.803 --> 00:53:21.743
when police attacked us

778
00:53:21.843 --> 00:53:23.543
on Manus

779
00:53:23.643 --> 00:53:25.883
and I had stammer, 
I couldn't talk.

780
00:53:28.363 --> 00:53:30.183
and she introduced herself

781
00:53:30.283 --> 00:53:34.383
my name is Christina ..., 
I am a trauma councillor

782
00:53:34.483 --> 00:53:36.483
I know your story

783
00:53:36.883 --> 00:53:40.623
I heard about what happened
to you and other refugees

784
00:53:40.723 --> 00:53:42.463
I'm here to help you

785
00:53:42.563 --> 00:53:44.503
don't worry I understand

786
00:53:44.603 --> 00:53:47.003
what was

787
00:53:48.683 --> 00:53:51.463
In the past, but you will be ok,

788
00:53:51.563 --> 00:53:53.223
just be patient

789
00:53:53.323 --> 00:53:55.303
and slowly

790
00:53:55.403 --> 00:53:58.683
she talked to me, like a lullaby

791
00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:01.103
I couldn't talk with my family

792
00:54:01.203 --> 00:54:02.183
no friends.

793
00:54:02.283 --> 00:54:03.863
I got very isolated.

794
00:54:03.963 --> 00:54:05.963
It was a huge

795
00:54:08.003 --> 00:54:10.563
trauma, when I talk...

796
00:54:14.083 --> 00:54:16.083
all the time stammer

797
00:54:16.523 --> 00:54:18.663
and she said, don't worry,
you dont need to talk.

798
00:54:18.763 --> 00:54:19.983
You just say yes or no

799
00:54:20.083 --> 00:54:21.823
or you just nod your head.

800
00:54:21.923 --> 00:54:23.983
or you just say mhmm.

801
00:54:24.083 --> 00:54:26.563
and slowly, slowly I got better

802
00:54:26.963 --> 00:54:30.403
and she said, Manus
is not safe for you.

803
00:54:31.163 --> 00:54:33.883
There is a reason
you have to be alive.

804
00:54:34.723 --> 00:54:37.723
Just be proud of yourself and be happy.

805
00:54:38.043 --> 00:54:39.543
You are a survivor Moz.

806
00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.643
You dont die.

807
00:54:45.563 --> 00:54:47.643
I miss her so much.

808
00:54:50.643 --> 00:54:54.283
Moz, dont worry about
me, I'm sorry, I'm just

809
00:54:54.643 --> 00:54:56.903
I've either got pain in my back

810
00:54:57.003 --> 00:55:00.343
or then when I take tablets. 
I feel really drowsy

811
00:55:00.443 --> 00:55:02.443
and I have to lay down.

812
00:55:03.683 --> 00:55:05.923
In 2019 she called me

813
00:55:06.483 --> 00:55:08.463
and she said um,

814
00:55:08.563 --> 00:55:12.803
she's going to be
alive for a few weeks.

815
00:55:13.803 --> 00:55:18.043
Her doctor talked to her and
she said, just a few weeks.

816
00:55:19.083 --> 00:55:21.363
and I didn't know what does that mean.

817
00:55:22.363 --> 00:55:24.643
What does a few weeks mean.

818
00:55:27.643 --> 00:55:29.643
I remember

819
00:55:30.363 --> 00:55:33.723
her daughter Molly called me

820
00:55:34.043 --> 00:55:36.523
and she said mum is ready

821
00:55:38.723 --> 00:55:42.363
and I had a huge stress

822
00:55:43.203 --> 00:55:46.103
and I just grabbed the guitar.

823
00:55:46.203 --> 00:55:48.923
I wrote a song for Christina

824
00:55:51.043 --> 00:55:54.763
and I played it for her

825
00:55:55.403 --> 00:55:58.243
I think, six or seven times.

826
00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:02.563
The last time when
I played it for her

827
00:56:03.323 --> 00:56:05.323
she slept.

828
00:56:12.523 --> 00:56:15.543
What a sad day.

829
00:56:15.643 --> 00:56:18.483
Imagine the best friend

830
00:56:19.443 --> 00:56:24.763
in anyones life, especially me in that situation

831
00:56:27.883 --> 00:56:29.883
but know when I look at

832
00:56:30.603 --> 00:56:34.363
what happened in the past, I think

833
00:56:34.883 --> 00:56:36.883
sometimes

834
00:56:37.643 --> 00:56:40.883
someone comes to our lives

835
00:56:42.523 --> 00:56:46.123
just like an angel.

836
00:56:47.443 --> 00:56:50.383
Yeah, she was definitely an angel

837
00:56:50.483 --> 00:56:52.603
and she saved my life.

838
00:56:57.003 --> 00:56:59.003
Love you to bits

839
00:57:37.523 --> 00:57:40.023
We liked it first, and
then we share it with

840
00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:44.523
other refugees. 
We had many concerts, small concerts

841
00:57:46.843 --> 00:57:48.063
and we played it

842
00:57:48.163 --> 00:57:51.243
a lot, and the people really liked it.

843
00:57:52.403 --> 00:57:56.123
This song took us to
somewhere else from the detention.

844
00:57:57.203 --> 00:58:00.683
There were different nationalities among refugees.

845
00:58:02.083 --> 00:58:05.583
Bengali, Somalian, Sudanese, Iraqi

846
00:58:05.683 --> 00:58:06.983
Kurdish.

847
00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:10.243
Most of the time
when we played music together,

848
00:58:10.963 --> 00:58:13.383
some of them randomly came close to us

849
00:58:13.483 --> 00:58:16.783
and listen to the music and they

850
00:58:16.883 --> 00:58:19.883
clapped and we were happy about it.

851
00:58:43.443 --> 00:58:46.783
This is the beauty
of the art always, eliminates

852
00:58:46.883 --> 00:58:50.863
the borders and makes everyone become united

853
00:58:50.963 --> 00:58:53.463
and there is no any difference.

854
00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:55.683
When you listen to Kurdish music

855
00:58:56.163 --> 00:58:58.103
takes you to somewhere.

856
00:58:58.203 --> 00:59:01.563
When I listen to English, 
Spanish takes me to somewhere

857
00:59:01.923 --> 00:59:04.703
I could feel it inside, it doesn't matter

858
00:59:04.803 --> 00:59:07.623
I don't understand the words, but I understand

859
00:59:07.723 --> 00:59:09.723
the feeling of the music.

860
00:59:10.603 --> 00:59:13.063
That's the beauty of art and music.

861
00:59:13.163 --> 00:59:14.463
Hello?

862
00:59:14.563 --> 00:59:15.623

863
00:59:15.723 --> 00:59:17.723

868
00:59:23.243 --> 00:59:23.823
Hi Nick.

869
00:59:23.923 --> 00:59:24.943
Hello Buddy

870
00:59:25.043 --> 00:59:26.023
Good to see you again.

871
00:59:26.123 --> 00:59:27.903
You too.

872
00:59:28.003 --> 00:59:28.423
Welcome.

873
00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:29.783
Thank you...

874
00:59:29.883 --> 00:59:31.823
Ready to record a song?

875
00:59:31.923 --> 00:59:33.923
Ready to go.

876
01:03:35.923 --> 01:03:38.923
Your version B...

877
01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:06.683
This is one of
the songs, always we sing.

878
01:06:07.843 --> 01:06:08.543
Do you remember?

879
01:06:08.643 --> 01:06:09.103
Yeah

880
01:06:09.203 --> 01:06:12.523
This song it's really

881
01:06:13.923 --> 01:06:15.923
common song in Kurdistan.

882
01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:17.823
It's a beautiful song.

883
01:06:17.923 --> 01:06:19.923
How did it go?

884
01:06:20.483 --> 01:06:21.463
You wanna go?

885
01:06:21.563 --> 01:06:23.563
Ok.

886
01:06:52.363 --> 01:06:54.363
I forgot.
