00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:40.668
This is a story

2
00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:43.804
about two kingdoms

3
00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:46.274
side by side,

4
00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:51.178
but worlds apart.

5
00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:55.983
All along the border

6
00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:59.053
magical flowers grew.

7
00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:04.124
Primroses bloom
between light and shadow.


8
00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:06.928
They are used to
make love potion.


9
00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:12.633
Because after all

10
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.269
everybody deserves
to be loved.


11
00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:29.717
Ooh!

12
00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.224
Whoa!

13
00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:50.838
Okay...

14
00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.977
- Wise men say

15
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.779
- Only fools

16
00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:01.048
- Only fools rush in

17
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:02.316
Oh!

18
00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.787
- But I can't help

19
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.192
- Falling in love with you

20
00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:18.032
- Shall I say

21
00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:21.869
- Would it be
Would it be a sin


22
00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:23.137
Sorry.

23
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.174
- That I can't help

24
00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:30.378
- Falling in love with you -

25
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:36.750
What?

26
00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.387
Primroses.

27
00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:44.058
Oh, no. I didn't mean to.

28
00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:45.392
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

29
00:03:00.207 --> 00:03:02.910
Was she trying to
get a primrose petal?


30
00:03:02.943 --> 00:03:04.244
We better tell him.

31
00:03:04.277 --> 00:03:05.879
He's not gonna be very happy.

32
00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:08.182
Let me handle it.
I'll tell him.


33
00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:08.949
Good idea!

34
00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:32.773
Sire! News from the border!

35
00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:36.143
You tell him.

36
00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:36.143
Huh? Okay.

37
00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:38.112
A fairy flew
into our forest.


38
00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:40.948
What?

39
00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:40.948
And almost took a primrose.

40
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:42.282
A primrose?

41
00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:48.189
I hate this time of year.

42
00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:50.958
Spring.

43
00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:53.427
Send more goblins

44
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.830
to cut down every primrose.

45
00:03:56.863 --> 00:04:00.033
No primroses,
no potion.


46
00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:03.738
No potion,
no love.


47
00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:06.140
Because love

48
00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:10.444
is dangerous.

49
00:04:10.477 --> 00:04:13.447
It weakens, it rots.

50
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.116
It destroys order.

51
00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.553
And without order,
what is left?


52
00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.989
Chaos.

53
00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:23.490
Destroy the primroses!

54
00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:26.827
Or I will destroy you.

55
00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:35.068
Whoa.

56
00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:35.068
Stuff.

57
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.204
Griselda. Ooh!

58
00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:38.872
I need your help.

59
00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:38.872
No.

60
00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:42.509
You know how
your boss, my son,


61
00:04:42.542 --> 00:04:46.547
is making everyone miserable
with his ban on love?


62
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.315
No.

63
00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:53.020
Don't you want to see love
return to the Dark Forest?


64
00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:56.590
No.

65
00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:56.590
But I found him
the perfect...


66
00:04:56.623 --> 00:04:58.292
I told you to stay
out of the light!


67
00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:09.436
Roland! Oh, thank goodness!

68
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.338
Whoa!

69
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:13.073
Aren't you supposed
to be getting ready
for our wedding?


70
00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:15.509
I will. I am!

71
00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:19.246
Oh, wait!
I have something for you!


72
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.982
For me? Why, aren't you
just the sweetest...


73
00:05:22.015 --> 00:05:23.283
Whoa!

74
00:05:23.316 --> 00:05:25.252
Marianne? You're in a plant.

75
00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:27.855
You can't look at me!
I forgot.


76
00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:29.590
Bad luck on our wedding day.

77
00:05:29.623 --> 00:05:32.392
Well, too bad you can't
see me.


78
00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:34.361
My hair is doing
that thing we both love.


79
00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:36.230
Ahh! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.


80
00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:38.098
Were you in the Dark Forest?

81
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:40.567
No! Maybe. Yes.

82
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.636
You could've been killed.

83
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.636
No! Don't look.

84
00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.204
Or worse,
seriously disfigured.


85
00:05:44.237 --> 00:05:46.907
Hey! I can take
care of myself.


86
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.209
That is no place
for a princess.


87
00:05:49.242 --> 00:05:52.346
Oh, yeah? How about
a princess that can do this?


88
00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.281
Marianne,
don't play with...


89
00:05:54.314 --> 00:05:55.916
Wow!

90
00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.184
Who's the big girl?
You got a sword. Yep.


91
00:05:57.217 --> 00:05:58.585
Okay.

92
00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:01.588
Yeah, but I don't
need a sword.


93
00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:03.891
Because when
I rule this kingdom,


94
00:06:03.924 --> 00:06:06.560
I'll go into that Dark Forest
to talk to them.


95
00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:10.230
To make it so, at long last,
we're not scared anymore.


96
00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:11.932
That is so sweet.

97
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:14.167
And then we can all go
anywhere we want


98
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.370
to have fun, to see things,

99
00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:18.605
to have adventures!

100
00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:21.008
I'll be your adventure.

101
00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:23.543
Come on, Marianne,

102
00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:24.511
my future queen.

103
00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:26.914
Aw...

104
00:06:26.947 --> 00:06:28.616
My future king.

105
00:06:26.947 --> 00:06:28.616
Yeah...

106
00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:32.586
King. I'll have an army.
Ooh!


107
00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.621
Yeah. Wait, what?

108
00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.621
Parry. Lunge.

109
00:06:34.654 --> 00:06:36.223
Um...

110
00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:38.992
To protect
the Fairy Kingdom,
and you,


111
00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:40.994
my little buttercup.

112
00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:40.994
Mmm.

113
00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:42.496
Now, go get yourself
all prettified.


114
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:46.934
Today has got to be perfect.

115
00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:49.036
Chipper! Let's ride.

116
00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:53.607
Marianne!

117
00:06:55.008 --> 00:06:56.310
Marianne!

118
00:06:55.008 --> 00:06:56.310
What?

119
00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:58.111
Remember the wedding?

120
00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:58.111
I know.

121
00:06:58.144 --> 00:06:59.346
We have to get ready!

122
00:06:58.144 --> 00:06:59.346
I know.

123
00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.014
What's with your hair?

124
00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.014
I know.

125
00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:02.249
We don't have much time!

126
00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:02.249
I know!

127
00:07:02.282 --> 00:07:03.583
Ugh! What's that?

128
00:07:03.616 --> 00:07:05.519
A boutonniere.

129
00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:07.688
Oh! I forgot to
give this to Roland.


130
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:09.623
You can't
give him that.


131
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:09.623
Why not?

132
00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:11.692
Uh, he's too good-looking?

133
00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:12.593
Yeah.

134
00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:17.564
I'll fix that.

135
00:07:17.597 --> 00:07:19.333
Thanks, sis.

136
00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:20.968
Ew!

137
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:22.703
Dawn!

138
00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:26.206
Do you think
that Roland loves me


139
00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:27.975
as much as I love him?

140
00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:30.444
Oh, Marianne.

141
00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:32.146
How could he not love you?

142
00:07:33.113 --> 00:07:34.648
You're so

143
00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:37.084
totally loveable!

144
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.386
Really?

145
00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.388
I wish you could
see how you look.


146
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.559
- Oh, you're looking
crazy in love


147
00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:48.061
- He's got you
looking crazy in love


148
00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:51.331
- Yeah, you're looking
crazy in love


149
00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:54.401
- Looking so crazy, got you
looking so crazy in love -


150
00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:56.203
It's perfect.

151
00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:56.203
You're welcome.

152
00:07:56.236 --> 00:07:57.704
I wanna give this
to him now!


153
00:07:57.737 --> 00:07:58.538
Isn't it bad luck
if he sees you...


154
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:00.040
- Oh, I

155
00:08:00.073 --> 00:08:02.376
- Can't help

156
00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:06.613
- Falling in love with you

157
00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:08.081
Uh-oh.

158
00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:09.116
- Uh-oh, uh-oh

159
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:11.718
- As the river flows

160
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:14.287
- Surely to the sea

161
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.556
- Darling, so it goes

162
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:18.225
- Some things

163
00:08:18.258 --> 00:08:22.662
- Are meant to be

164
00:08:22.695 --> 00:08:24.664
- Oh, yeah

165
00:08:24.697 --> 00:08:29.469
- Some things are
meant to be


166
00:08:29.502 --> 00:08:32.572
- Take my hand

167
00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:34.341
- Oh, take my hand

168
00:08:34.374 --> 00:08:36.610
- Take my whole life, too

169
00:08:36.643 --> 00:08:38.445
- Take my whole life, too

170
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.817
- For I can't help

171
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.755
- Falling in love with you

172
00:08:48.788 --> 00:08:50.690
- Oh, you're looking
crazy in love


173
00:08:50.723 --> 00:08:51.759
- He's got you
looking crazy in love


174
00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:56.063
- Oh, you're looking
crazy in love


175
00:08:56.096 --> 00:08:58.732
- Looking so crazy, got me
looking so crazy in love


176
00:08:58.765 --> 00:09:00.634
- Oh, you're looking
crazy in love


177
00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:01.601
- He's got you
looking crazy in love


178
00:09:01.634 --> 00:09:03.570
Hey! Marianne!

179
00:09:03.603 --> 00:09:04.371
- Oh, you're looking
crazy in love


180
00:09:07.807 --> 00:09:12.746
- And I can't help it

181
00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:15.415
- No, I can't help it

182
00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:18.418
- I can't help it

183
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:20.220
- And no, I

184
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:20.220
- I

185
00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:22.389
- Can't help

186
00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:22.389
- No, I can't help

187
00:09:22.422 --> 00:09:24.858
- Falling in love

188
00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:27.194
- With you

189
00:09:27.227 --> 00:09:29.129
- So crazy,
crazy in love, yeah


190
00:09:29.162 --> 00:09:31.398
- And no I know I can't help

191
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:32.732
- No, I

192
00:09:32.765 --> 00:09:35.736
- Falling in love -

193
00:09:37.737 --> 00:09:38.572
Roland!

194
00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:02.596
I am so

195
00:10:02.629 --> 00:10:04.298
not getting my army.

196
00:10:16.376 --> 00:10:17.311
Marianne?

197
00:10:19.712 --> 00:10:20.481
Marianne?

198
00:10:22.916 --> 00:10:24.651
Dawn.

199
00:10:24.684 --> 00:10:26.486
What happened?

200
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.521
I...

201
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:29.790
I don't wanna talk about it.

202
00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:32.259
Not even to me?

203
00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:34.628
I can't.

204
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:35.795
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:35.828 --> 00:10:36.863
But wait.

206
00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:38.231
Wait!

207
00:10:38.264 --> 00:10:40.700
Tell Dad

208
00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:42.235
the wedding's off.

209
00:10:42.268 --> 00:10:43.337
The wedding's off?

210
00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:51.845
- What do you get
when you fall in love?


211
00:10:53.713 --> 00:10:57.918
- A guy with a pin
to burst your bubble


212
00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:01.621
- That's what you get

213
00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:04.457
- For all your trouble

214
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.861
- I'll never fall in love

215
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:14.501
- Again

216
00:11:14.534 --> 00:11:18.572
- What do you get
when you kiss a boy?


217
00:11:18.605 --> 00:11:22.342
- You get enough germs
to catch a fever


218
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:25.612
- Then straight away
he'll up and leave you


219
00:11:25.645 --> 00:11:27.747
- I'll

220
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.919
- Never fall in love again

221
00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:38.792
- No,
I'll never fall in love again


222
00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:41.661
- Don't tell me
what it's all about


223
00:11:41.694 --> 00:11:43.763
- All about

224
00:11:43.796 --> 00:11:48.335
- 'Cause I've been there
And I'm glad I'm out


225
00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:51.504
- Out of those chains
Those chains that bind you


226
00:11:51.537 --> 00:11:54.975
- That is why
I'm here to remind you


227
00:11:55.008 --> 00:11:57.477
- Here to remind you

228
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.447
- What do you get
when you give your heart?


229
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.883
- You get it all
broken up and battered


230
00:12:03.916 --> 00:12:06.353
- Yeah, that's what you get

231
00:12:06.386 --> 00:12:08.388
- A heart that's shattered

232
00:12:08.421 --> 00:12:11.959
- I'll never
fall in love again


233
00:12:14.727 --> 00:12:17.297
- No, I'll

234
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.599
- Never fall in love again

235
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:24.271
- No, I'll

236
00:12:24.304 --> 00:12:28.675
- Never fall in love again -

237
00:12:35.815 --> 00:12:36.783
Dawn!

238
00:12:38.318 --> 00:12:39.987
Dawn! Where are you?

239
00:12:41.754 --> 00:12:42.956
Dawn!

240
00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:44.791
The coast is clear.

241
00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:05.645
Shh! She'll hear you.

242
00:13:07.413 --> 00:13:08.782
Whatever happened
that wedding day


243
00:13:08.815 --> 00:13:10.583
must have been really bad.

244
00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:12.619
Yeah, bad.

245
00:13:12.652 --> 00:13:15.088
Because now she's always
hovering, watching, worrying.


246
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:17.490
What's she trying
to protect me from?


247
00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:18.692
You can take care
of yourself.


248
00:13:18.725 --> 00:13:19.959
Yeah. So...

249
00:13:19.992 --> 00:13:21.895
Spring Ball.

250
00:13:19.992 --> 00:13:21.895
Yeah.

251
00:13:21.928 --> 00:13:23.797
My first dance.

252
00:13:21.928 --> 00:13:23.797
Yeah!

253
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.432
What's your plan?

254
00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:27.067
I made it so when
the music starts,


255
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.536
you'll "accidentally"
bump into Hadrian.


256
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.871
Ooh!

257
00:13:31.904 --> 00:13:33.873
Oh! Today is
gonna be so exciting!


258
00:13:33.906 --> 00:13:35.875
Mmm. It already is.

259
00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:37.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

260
00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:37.010
What?

261
00:13:37.043 --> 00:13:38.411
Hadrian?

262
00:13:38.444 --> 00:13:39.846
Yeah, Hadrian.

263
00:13:39.879 --> 00:13:41.548
The guy with the great,
red, wavy hair.


264
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:42.882
No, no, no.

265
00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:44.818
I don't have a crush on him.

266
00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:47.754
I really like Nathan.

267
00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:49.055
Okay. I gotta find Hadrian,

268
00:13:49.088 --> 00:13:50.156
tell Hadrian to
stand in a new place,


269
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:51.558
find Nathan and tell him
to stand in the old place


270
00:13:51.591 --> 00:13:52.759
Hadrian was standing in.

271
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:54.060
What if he doesn't like me?

272
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:54.060
What?

273
00:13:54.093 --> 00:13:56.029
Snap out of it! Listen.

274
00:13:56.062 --> 00:13:57.530
Like I always say...

275
00:13:57.563 --> 00:13:58.865
- Don't worry

276
00:13:58.898 --> 00:13:59.899
Maybe he thinks
I'm too perky.


277
00:13:59.932 --> 00:14:00.934
- About a thing

278
00:14:00.967 --> 00:14:03.470
Or dance funny?

279
00:14:03.503 --> 00:14:05.739
- 'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right


280
00:14:05.772 --> 00:14:07.841
Or my hair is too poufy?

281
00:14:07.874 --> 00:14:10.944
- Don't you worry
About a thing


282
00:14:10.977 --> 00:14:12.612
- About a thing

283
00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:13.913
- Oh, 'cause

284
00:14:13.947 --> 00:14:16.683
- 'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right


285
00:14:16.716 --> 00:14:17.917
All right!

286
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.120
- Woke up this morning

287
00:14:20.153 --> 00:14:23.056
- Smiled at the rising sun

288
00:14:23.089 --> 00:14:25.125
- Three little birds

289
00:14:25.158 --> 00:14:27.961
- Pitch by my doorstep

290
00:14:27.994 --> 00:14:30.563
- Singin' sweet songs

291
00:14:30.596 --> 00:14:33.066
- Of melodies pure and true

292
00:14:33.099 --> 00:14:34.567
- Sayin'

293
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.605
- This is my message to you

294
00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:39.739
- Oh, don't worry

295
00:14:39.772 --> 00:14:41.007
- Don't worry

296
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.175
- About a thing

297
00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:44.844
Sunny.

298
00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:44.844
Dawn, I'm trying to sing.

299
00:14:44.877 --> 00:14:46.513
- 'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right


300
00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:47.981
Sunny.

301
00:14:48.014 --> 00:14:49.449
Yes!

302
00:14:49.482 --> 00:14:50.650
- Don't worry about a thing -

303
00:14:51.918 --> 00:14:53.052
Sunny?

304
00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:54.621
What?

305
00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:54.621
Worry!

306
00:14:56.656 --> 00:14:58.625
No, no, no!

307
00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:01.628
Hey! Watch the ears!

308
00:15:01.661 --> 00:15:02.562
Help!

309
00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:04.464
Help! We've gotta get help!

310
00:15:08.668 --> 00:15:09.836
You're looking at it.

311
00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:16.943
Ahh! Sunny!

312
00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:19.646
Too short to run!

313
00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:22.816
Too young to die!

314
00:15:22.849 --> 00:15:24.584
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:15:24.617 --> 00:15:27.187
Marianne!
Are you crazy?


316
00:15:32.158 --> 00:15:32.959
Sunny, go right!

317
00:15:38.097 --> 00:15:39.632
Sunny, duck!

318
00:15:39.665 --> 00:15:40.500
Okay!

319
00:15:41.634 --> 00:15:43.203
Dawn, some help here.

320
00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:00.954
What am I gonna
do with you?


321
00:16:00.987 --> 00:16:04.524
Sorry.
I didn't know what to do.


322
00:16:04.557 --> 00:16:05.826
Pull your head
out of the clouds!


323
00:16:06.993 --> 00:16:08.228
Clouds full of boys.

324
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:10.930
I can't help it.

325
00:16:10.963 --> 00:16:12.699
You just have no idea
what's going on around you.


326
00:16:15.735 --> 00:16:17.571
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.


327
00:16:20.806 --> 00:16:21.608
Where's Sunny?

328
00:16:31.584 --> 00:16:33.520
You were
in the Dark Forest!


329
00:16:31.584 --> 00:16:33.520
I was?

330
00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:34.921
He was?

331
00:16:34.954 --> 00:16:35.822
Do you want
what happened


332
00:16:35.855 --> 00:16:37.857
to the Sugar Plum Fairy
to happen to you?


333
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:38.858
No!

334
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:38.858
No, no!

335
00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:41.628
Locked away forever

336
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:45.698
because she made
love potion from...


337
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:47.767
Primroses!

338
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.602
We have to get
out of here now!


339
00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:51.905
That place...

340
00:16:53.205 --> 00:16:55.074
Marianne?

341
00:16:55.107 --> 00:16:56.309
Hello?

342
00:16:56.342 --> 00:16:58.177
Marianne!

343
00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.779
We're gonna be late
for the Spring Ball!


344
00:17:00.947 --> 00:17:03.750
You drive me crazy!

345
00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:07.854
We have to get
out of here, now.


346
00:17:07.887 --> 00:17:09.222
I just said that.

347
00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:23.937
So, that's how you react

348
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.305
to a near-death
experience?


349
00:17:26.739 --> 00:17:27.840
Ugh!

350
00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:29.142
What?

351
00:17:29.175 --> 00:17:31.711
You were both
nearly killed.


352
00:17:31.744 --> 00:17:33.746
You make such a big deal
out of everything.


353
00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:36.049
Whoa! I'm a total mess!

354
00:17:36.082 --> 00:17:38.251
We have to get
ready for the ball.


355
00:17:38.284 --> 00:17:40.954
Ha! No, you've gotta
get ready for the ball.


356
00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:43.323
Uh, you're going like that?

357
00:17:43.356 --> 00:17:45.291
Good luck being
asked to dance.


358
00:17:45.324 --> 00:17:46.693
I'm not dancing.

359
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.631
I'm gonna dance
with the most perfect boy.


360
00:17:51.664 --> 00:17:53.866
And who would that be?

361
00:17:53.899 --> 00:17:55.335
Aaron?

362
00:17:53.899 --> 00:17:55.335
No.

363
00:17:55.368 --> 00:17:57.236
Benjamin. Charles.
Darren!


364
00:17:57.269 --> 00:17:58.738
No.

365
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:00.707
Gordon? Herbert?

366
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:00.707
No.

367
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.843
I'm going alphabetical,
if that helps.


368
00:18:05.378 --> 00:18:06.246
Hi.

369
00:18:11.951 --> 00:18:13.620
Smile, my dear. Smile.

370
00:18:16.355 --> 00:18:17.824
A real smile.

371
00:18:17.857 --> 00:18:19.792
This is one of my better ones.

372
00:18:19.825 --> 00:18:21.160
You used to love
the Spring Ball.


373
00:18:21.193 --> 00:18:23.062
Dad, I'm just
too old for this.


374
00:18:23.095 --> 00:18:26.165
I just want to see the happy
Marianne I used to know.


375
00:18:26.198 --> 00:18:29.268
Before the...
The Roland misunderstanding.


376
00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:30.070
I'm happy.

377
00:18:31.003 --> 00:18:32.972
I'm happy.

378
00:18:33.005 --> 00:18:35.174
Well, I hope you're
happy enough to dance
with your father.


379
00:18:35.207 --> 00:18:37.343
Or someone

380
00:18:37.376 --> 00:18:38.645
even better.

381
00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:43.683
- Here I am

382
00:18:43.716 --> 00:18:44.984
Roland!

383
00:18:45.017 --> 00:18:47.920
- On my knees again

384
00:18:47.953 --> 00:18:49.389
Dad!

385
00:18:49.422 --> 00:18:52.025
- I'd do anything

386
00:18:52.058 --> 00:18:53.760
He's so romantic.

387
00:18:53.793 --> 00:18:56.195
- Just to make it right

388
00:18:56.228 --> 00:18:58.197
I'm so onto
that hair thing.


389
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.433
- Say you'll understand

390
00:19:00.466 --> 00:19:01.368
Never!

391
00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:04.437
- I know you can

392
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.938
Oh, no, I can't!

393
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:08.341
- Come on, Marianne

394
00:19:08.374 --> 00:19:12.311
- Come on, Marianne

395
00:19:12.344 --> 00:19:14.681
You cheated on me, remember?

396
00:19:14.714 --> 00:19:17.150
You left me at the altar,
remember?


397
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.823
- No matter what people say

398
00:19:23.856 --> 00:19:24.957
- It didn't happen that way

399
00:19:26.258 --> 00:19:27.060
- She was a passing fling

400
00:19:28.427 --> 00:19:30.129
- And not a permanent thing

401
00:19:30.162 --> 00:19:31.931
Oh, really?

402
00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:34.801
- So I hang my head
Oh, I wish that I was dead


403
00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:36.102
I can help with that.

404
00:19:36.135 --> 00:19:37.203
- Come on, Marianne

405
00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:38.838
Hi. I'm Dawn.

406
00:19:38.871 --> 00:19:40.306
Come on, Marianne.

407
00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:41.207
- Come on...

408
00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:41.207
- Marianne

409
00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:47.213
- Say you can understand

410
00:19:47.246 --> 00:19:49.415
- My Marianne -

411
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.087
Ugh! I'm not your anything.

412
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.789
Hey. One little mistake.

413
00:19:56.822 --> 00:19:58.091
Little?

414
00:19:58.124 --> 00:20:02.729
You got a lot of
nerve walking in here.


415
00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:05.131
- Think you got
the best of me


416
00:20:05.164 --> 00:20:06.866
- Think you had
the last laugh


417
00:20:06.899 --> 00:20:08.034
No.

418
00:20:08.067 --> 00:20:09.969
- Bet you think
that everything


419
00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:11.804
- Good is gone

420
00:20:11.837 --> 00:20:13.906
Hold on there, darling.

421
00:20:13.939 --> 00:20:16.375
- Think you
left me broken down


422
00:20:16.408 --> 00:20:17.744
- Think that I'd come
running back


423
00:20:17.777 --> 00:20:19.345
Well...

424
00:20:19.378 --> 00:20:22.849
- Baby, you don't know me
'cause you're dead wrong


425
00:20:22.882 --> 00:20:24.784
Okay, slow down there,
Marianne.


426
00:20:24.817 --> 00:20:27.854
- What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger


427
00:20:27.887 --> 00:20:28.921
- Stand a little taller

428
00:20:30.222 --> 00:20:32.158
- Doesn't mean I'm lonely

429
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:34.227
- When I'm alone

430
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.462
- What does not kill you
makes a fighter


431
00:20:36.495 --> 00:20:37.897
Whoa! Watch the face!

432
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.031
- Footsteps even lighter

433
00:20:39.064 --> 00:20:41.100
Whoa, whoa.
Come on, I mean, seriously.


434
00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:42.468
- Doesn't mean I'm over
'cause you're gone -


435
00:20:42.501 --> 00:20:44.237
Whoa!

436
00:20:46.906 --> 00:20:48.007
- Here I am

437
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.108
Oh, there you go.

438
00:20:49.141 --> 00:20:50.510
- On my knees again

439
00:20:50.543 --> 00:20:51.678
On your knees again.

440
00:20:51.711 --> 00:20:55.481
- I'll do anything
just to make it right


441
00:20:55.514 --> 00:20:56.783
Yeah, right.

442
00:20:56.816 --> 00:20:57.550
- Say you'll understand

443
00:20:57.583 --> 00:20:58.985
Only too well.

444
00:20:59.018 --> 00:21:00.220
- Oh, I know you can

445
00:21:01.187 --> 00:21:02.455
- Come on, Marianne

446
00:21:02.488 --> 00:21:04.557
- Didn't think
that I'd come back


447
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.793
- I'd come back swinging

448
00:21:08.828 --> 00:21:10.096
Buttercup.

449
00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:11.397
Oops.

450
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.066
Cheater,
cheater, cheater!


451
00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:18.838
- What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger


452
00:21:18.871 --> 00:21:20.072
Back up! Back up! Hey!

453
00:21:20.105 --> 00:21:21.474
- Stand a little taller

454
00:21:21.507 --> 00:21:24.110
- Doesn't mean I'm lonely
when I'm alone


455
00:21:24.143 --> 00:21:26.212
- What doesn't kill you
makes a fighter


456
00:21:26.245 --> 00:21:27.180
- Footsteps even lighter

457
00:21:28.614 --> 00:21:31.551
- Doesn't mean I'm over
'cause you're gone


458
00:21:31.584 --> 00:21:33.886
- What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, stronger


459
00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.388
Don't bruise the jewels!

460
00:21:35.421 --> 00:21:38.257
- Just me, myself and I

461
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.293
- What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger


462
00:21:40.326 --> 00:21:41.961
- Stand a little taller

463
00:21:41.994 --> 00:21:43.129
What are you
trying to say?


464
00:21:43.162 --> 00:21:44.096
- Well, now it's time to say

465
00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:45.932
- Goodbye -

466
00:21:49.368 --> 00:21:51.004
Bye-bye.

467
00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:53.873
Now, that was fun!

468
00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:56.609
Awkward.

469
00:21:56.642 --> 00:21:57.443
Ugh!

470
00:22:01.614 --> 00:22:03.182
Whoa!

471
00:22:03.215 --> 00:22:05.184
Marianne slammed
him pretty good.


472
00:22:05.217 --> 00:22:06.419
Well, so much
for being king.


473
00:22:06.452 --> 00:22:07.420
Ouch!

474
00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:10.156
You think I can't be king?

475
00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:11.490
King Roland!

476
00:22:11.523 --> 00:22:12.258
Well...

477
00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:16.295
Uh, wouldn't he have to
marry Marianne?


478
00:22:16.328 --> 00:22:18.631
Yes, and he will.

479
00:22:18.664 --> 00:22:22.268
All we have to do is
get some of that love potion.


480
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:23.502
You saying I need
a love potion?


481
00:22:23.535 --> 00:22:24.537
No, no, just kidding!

482
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.005
It was just a joke.

483
00:22:26.038 --> 00:22:28.107
We gotta go.
Just kidding, boss!


484
00:22:28.641 --> 00:22:30.142
Okay.

485
00:22:31.543 --> 00:22:34.513
All I gotta do is visualize.

486
00:22:34.546 --> 00:22:37.116
Visualize.

487
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:39.619
The crown,
sitting right on top...


488
00:22:41.287 --> 00:22:42.989
- I wanna dance
with somebody


489
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.660
- I wanna feel
the beat with somebody


490
00:22:47.693 --> 00:22:51.364
- Yeah, I wanna dance

491
00:22:51.397 --> 00:22:52.565
Hi!

492
00:22:52.598 --> 00:22:54.967
- With somebody
who loves me -


493
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.270
You okay?

494
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.270
Who, me?  Okay?

495
00:22:57.303 --> 00:22:59.438
Yes, I am.

496
00:22:59.471 --> 00:23:01.007
No.

497
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.277
Hey, elf.
I know just how you feel.


498
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.279
Yeah. Marianne
slammed you pretty good.


499
00:23:12.584 --> 00:23:15.922
Aw! You got it bad.

500
00:23:15.955 --> 00:23:19.558
I wish there was a way to
make her fall in love with me.


501
00:23:19.591 --> 00:23:20.960
Yeah.

502
00:23:20.993 --> 00:23:22.662
Me, too.

503
00:23:22.695 --> 00:23:24.931
Like, I don't know, maybe
something like a love potion.


504
00:23:24.964 --> 00:23:26.132
Like a love potion!

505
00:23:26.165 --> 00:23:27.466
Great idea!

506
00:23:27.499 --> 00:23:29.669
It is a great idea.

507
00:23:29.702 --> 00:23:32.271
Except only
the Sugar Plum Fairy
can make the potion.


508
00:23:32.304 --> 00:23:34.073
She's locked away
in the Dark Forest


509
00:23:34.106 --> 00:23:35.341
and nobody ever goes
into the Dark Forest!


510
00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:39.011
But I know you can.

511
00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:41.147
But why can't you?

512
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.982
Because I'm big!

513
00:23:43.015 --> 00:23:45.985
My armor, it's too shiny.

514
00:23:46.018 --> 00:23:47.486
I'd be spotted for sure.

515
00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:50.589
If only I was little,
like you.


516
00:23:50.622 --> 00:23:52.158
Uh-huh.

517
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:54.393
And I could blend in.
Like you.


518
00:23:54.426 --> 00:23:56.195
I do blend in.

519
00:23:56.228 --> 00:23:59.098
Oh, it would
have been perfect!


520
00:23:59.131 --> 00:24:02.535
Then we both,
you know, me and you,


521
00:24:02.568 --> 00:24:05.271
both used the love potion.

522
00:24:05.304 --> 00:24:07.173
I'll do it!

523
00:24:05.304 --> 00:24:07.173
You will?

524
00:24:07.206 --> 00:24:09.508
If you stop crying.

525
00:24:09.541 --> 00:24:11.945
What? Oh, I'm much better now.

526
00:24:13.245 --> 00:24:15.648
My plan is perfect!

527
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:17.283
All I gotta do is
find a primrose flower,


528
00:24:17.316 --> 00:24:18.551
get to the castle

529
00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:20.052
where I'll find
the Sugar Plum Fairy.


530
00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:22.254
She'll make her love potion

531
00:24:22.287 --> 00:24:23.756
with all the little
primrose petals that I...


532
00:24:26.492 --> 00:24:28.227
Man, those goblins work fast!

533
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.128
Uh-oh.

534
00:24:30.129 --> 00:24:31.664
Petal, petal, petal.

535
00:24:31.697 --> 00:24:33.432
Think quick, think!

536
00:24:33.465 --> 00:24:34.567
Ah! Duh.

537
00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:37.704
All right.

538
00:24:53.752 --> 00:24:56.722
A small elf
is in the Dark Forest.


539
00:24:56.755 --> 00:24:58.257
A small elf is in
the Dark Forest.


540
00:25:11.804 --> 00:25:13.172
Oh! Got it!

541
00:25:14.673 --> 00:25:16.409
Thang! Thang!

542
00:25:19.078 --> 00:25:20.379
What does it mean?

543
00:25:20.412 --> 00:25:21.414
I'm listening.

544
00:25:23.248 --> 00:25:25.718
News from the mushrooms, sire.

545
00:25:25.751 --> 00:25:27.153
You can tell him.

546
00:25:25.751 --> 00:25:27.153
You tell him.

547
00:25:27.186 --> 00:25:28.187
He likes you.

548
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.422
Really?

549
00:25:29.455 --> 00:25:31.024
Now I'm waiting!

550
00:25:32.624 --> 00:25:37.263
A tall chef is
into shark storage!


551
00:25:37.296 --> 00:25:38.731
What?

552
00:25:38.764 --> 00:25:42.134
Okay, you know how
we sometimes have a shark,


553
00:25:42.167 --> 00:25:44.136
but no place to store it?

554
00:25:44.169 --> 00:25:49.675
Well, a very tall chef
has that very same problem.


555
00:25:49.708 --> 00:25:52.244
Hmm. That doesn't
make any sense.


556
00:25:52.277 --> 00:25:53.346
I'll deal with it!

557
00:25:55.247 --> 00:25:56.582
Ahem.

558
00:25:56.615 --> 00:25:57.450
What?

559
00:25:58.684 --> 00:26:00.252
That was close.

560
00:26:11.263 --> 00:26:13.766
A small elf is in
the Dark Forest!


561
00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:19.738
Well, if he's looking
for trouble,


562
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.743
he's come to the right place.

563
00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:28.481
- Yeah

564
00:26:28.514 --> 00:26:32.485
- If he's looking for trouble

565
00:26:32.518 --> 00:26:36.689
- Just take
a look at this face


566
00:26:40.526 --> 00:26:43.629
- Because I'm evil

567
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.198
Yeah.

568
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:50.603
- My middle name is misery

569
00:26:53.305 --> 00:26:58.177
- Yes, I'm evil

570
00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.415
- So don't you
mess around with me -


571
00:27:08.787 --> 00:27:10.523
- Don't worry

572
00:27:10.556 --> 00:27:13.592
- About a thing

573
00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:16.562
- 'Cause every little
thing is gonna be... -


574
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.366
- Woke up this morning

575
00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:23.936
- I hope I woke up
this morning


576
00:27:23.969 --> 00:27:27.373
- Three goblins

577
00:27:27.406 --> 00:27:32.378
- Sayin' I'm
going to kill you -


578
00:27:33.712 --> 00:27:36.315
Oh! Okay, you got me!

579
00:27:36.348 --> 00:27:37.650
Just kill me now.
Make it quick.


580
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.925
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

581
00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:47.860
Did you tie my...

582
00:27:47.893 --> 00:27:50.229
Who are you?

583
00:27:55.434 --> 00:27:56.302
Hmm.

584
00:28:00.672 --> 00:28:02.208
Okay, look,
you little thing,


585
00:28:02.241 --> 00:28:03.776
I'm a guy who usually
enjoys a good joke,


586
00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:05.878
even at my own expense.

587
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:08.647
But right now, I'm not in
a "ha-ha" frame of mind.


588
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.949
I'm in an "Ah!"
frame of mind.


589
00:28:09.982 --> 00:28:10.917
Ah!

590
00:28:13.018 --> 00:28:18.991
I am on a very
serious mission!


591
00:28:19.024 --> 00:28:20.226
I really gotta find
the Sugar Plum Fairy,


592
00:28:21.627 --> 00:28:22.361
the maker of
the all-powerful love potion,


593
00:28:22.395 --> 00:28:24.330
and you're holding
me back. Ow!


594
00:28:25.564 --> 00:28:26.832
You know where she is?

595
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

596
00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:47.853
What?

597
00:28:47.886 --> 00:28:49.422
Oh. Okay.

598
00:28:50.422 --> 00:28:51.991
Wait a minute.

599
00:28:52.024 --> 00:28:52.925
You ain't gonna
trick me again, are you?


600
00:28:55.494 --> 00:28:57.596
Good. Because I'm an elf,

601
00:28:57.629 --> 00:28:58.931
and we're very
trusting creatures.


602
00:29:01.933 --> 00:29:03.236
So here's me,

603
00:29:04.803 --> 00:29:05.838
trusting you.

604
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.885
Marianne!

605
00:29:19.918 --> 00:29:21.720
Kinda busy.

606
00:29:21.753 --> 00:29:23.589
I deserved that one.

607
00:29:26.525 --> 00:29:28.827
The Elves' Spring Dance
is starting soon.


608
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.297
I want you...

609
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.297
After the last dance?

610
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.898
You kidding me?

611
00:29:32.931 --> 00:29:33.733
Oh, Marianne.

612
00:29:35.467 --> 00:29:38.604
You're...
You're a unique girl.


613
00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:42.708
And Roland
may have a few flaws...


614
00:29:42.741 --> 00:29:44.476
Understatement.

615
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:45.911
But he still loves you.

616
00:29:45.944 --> 00:29:47.413
He loves the crown.

617
00:29:45.944 --> 00:29:47.413
But...

618
00:29:47.446 --> 00:29:49.048
And his hair.

619
00:29:47.446 --> 00:29:49.048
But, but...

620
00:29:49.081 --> 00:29:51.050
Not in that order.

621
00:29:49.081 --> 00:29:51.050
But if not Roland,

622
00:29:51.083 --> 00:29:53.018
then there has to
be someone else!


623
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:54.620
No, there doesn't.

624
00:29:54.653 --> 00:29:55.888
Maybe if you got
out more often.


625
00:29:55.921 --> 00:29:57.990
Let it go, Dad.

626
00:29:58.023 --> 00:30:00.859
You'll be a stronger ruler
with a king at your side.


627
00:30:00.892 --> 00:30:03.362
I'm stronger alone.

628
00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:06.932
I don't want you to be alone.

629
00:30:06.965 --> 00:30:09.935
Dad, I promise

630
00:30:09.968 --> 00:30:13.539
if I find a guy out there
who takes my hand


631
00:30:13.572 --> 00:30:15.541
and looks me in the eye

632
00:30:15.574 --> 00:30:17.343
and I don't
want to hit him...


633
00:30:17.376 --> 00:30:18.577
I'll consider it.

634
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.713
But that guy doesn't exist.

635
00:30:20.746 --> 00:30:24.049
Then go to the dance to
help me keep an eye on that


636
00:30:24.082 --> 00:30:25.985
flirtatious sister of yours.

637
00:30:28.787 --> 00:30:29.822
That's my girl!

638
00:30:46.438 --> 00:30:47.740
Did you find him?

639
00:30:46.438 --> 00:30:47.740
I thought
I heard something.


640
00:30:49.141 --> 00:30:50.976
If you see him, kill him.

641
00:30:53.145 --> 00:30:54.546
I won't fit.

642
00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:00.419
Come on.

643
00:31:02.854 --> 00:31:04.090
She's that scary?

644
00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:23.776
Whoa!

645
00:31:31.783 --> 00:31:33.619
Hello?

646
00:31:37.989 --> 00:31:40.793
Are you the Sugar Plum Fairy?

647
00:31:40.826 --> 00:31:41.927
I expected something more

648
00:31:42.828 --> 00:31:43.562
purple.

649
00:31:45.897 --> 00:31:47.499
Hello?

650
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.003
A primrose?

651
00:31:51.036 --> 00:31:52.838
It is!
I brought it so you can...


652
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:53.839
Nuh-uh.

653
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:53.839
So you can make...

654
00:31:54.973 --> 00:31:56.508
The love potion.

655
00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:57.910
How do you think
I got in here?


656
00:31:57.943 --> 00:32:00.913
Shh! Listen, my name is Sunny.

657
00:32:00.946 --> 00:32:02.181
The Bog King
won't listen to me


658
00:32:02.214 --> 00:32:04.917
about what happened
on that fateful day.


659
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.753
And I've been
locked away for so long.


660
00:32:07.786 --> 00:32:09.721
"That fateful day"?

661
00:32:09.754 --> 00:32:11.957
You were listening!
So I'll do it.


662
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.559
Yes!

663
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.559
If

664
00:32:13.592 --> 00:32:16.929
you promise to set me free!

665
00:32:16.962 --> 00:32:18.630
What?

666
00:32:18.663 --> 00:32:20.499
Shake on it?

667
00:32:18.663 --> 00:32:20.499
Uh...

668
00:32:20.532 --> 00:32:21.200
You can reach in.
I can't reach out.


669
00:32:24.803 --> 00:32:26.772
You should see your face!

670
00:32:26.805 --> 00:32:28.740
Oh, wait. I can show you!

671
00:32:30.275 --> 00:32:32.544
Another good one!
Wanna see?


672
00:32:32.577 --> 00:32:33.012
No, no, no.

673
00:32:32.577 --> 00:32:33.012
Petal.

674
00:32:37.649 --> 00:32:38.717
Plumettes!

675
00:32:39.684 --> 00:32:41.753
Believe you me,

676
00:32:41.786 --> 00:32:44.990
there can be
unforeseen consequences.


677
00:32:45.023 --> 00:32:46.692
Like what?

678
00:32:46.725 --> 00:32:48.027
- Love

679
00:32:49.861 --> 00:32:53.632
- Love is strange

680
00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:54.933
Uh, now's not
the time for a concert.


681
00:32:54.966 --> 00:32:57.669
- Many people

682
00:32:57.702 --> 00:32:59.505
Shh! Whoa!

683
00:32:59.538 --> 00:33:01.907
- Take it for a game

684
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.809
No lookie-loos!

685
00:33:03.842 --> 00:33:06.912
- Once you get it

686
00:33:06.945 --> 00:33:08.046
Ah!

687
00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:09.781
- You're in an awful...

688
00:33:09.814 --> 00:33:11.216
What did I say?

689
00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:12.851
No looking... No... Mmm-mmm.

690
00:33:12.884 --> 00:33:15.855
- 'Cause after you've had it

691
00:33:16.988 --> 00:33:20.259
- You never wanna quit

692
00:33:20.292 --> 00:33:22.661
If you think making
the potion's dangerous,


693
00:33:22.694 --> 00:33:24.630
wait till you use it.

694
00:33:26.565 --> 00:33:31.770
- Love is strange

695
00:33:34.806 --> 00:33:38.878
- Love

696
00:33:42.948 --> 00:33:47.719
- Is strange

697
00:33:47.752 --> 00:33:50.155
Oh! I'm so good,
it scares me so!


698
00:33:56.027 --> 00:33:57.563
Is the elf taken care of?

699
00:33:57.596 --> 00:33:58.730
He's a slippery
little devil.


700
00:33:58.763 --> 00:33:59.565
He's just an elf!

701
00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:02.734
Hi!

702
00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:02.734
Mom, no.

703
00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:05.837
Oh, relax your thorax.
Feast your eyes on...


704
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.039
No.

705
00:34:07.072 --> 00:34:08.640
Maxine's into fungi.

706
00:34:08.673 --> 00:34:10.008
No!

707
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:11.276
Lakeesha's hobby
is killing frogs.


708
00:34:11.309 --> 00:34:12.711
Mom!

709
00:34:12.744 --> 00:34:14.112
All you need
is somebody to...


710
00:34:14.145 --> 00:34:16.148
Don't say it.

711
00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:19.718
What is it with men?
They can't say
that word, lo...


712
00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:20.953
This is what
I get for carrying you


713
00:34:20.986 --> 00:34:22.721
23 months in my womb?

714
00:34:23.622 --> 00:34:24.856
Promise to stop talking?

715
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:25.758
Mmm-hmm.

716
00:34:26.925 --> 00:34:28.894
- Love!

717
00:34:30.028 --> 00:34:33.165
- Once you get it

718
00:34:34.299 --> 00:34:37.703
- You're in an awful fix

719
00:34:37.736 --> 00:34:39.871
Whoops! I almost
forgot the last step!


720
00:34:39.904 --> 00:34:42.274
- But after you've had it

721
00:34:42.307 --> 00:34:44.009
- You never wanna quit

722
00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:45.677
Directions.

723
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.746
Dust the one you love.
Stand in front.


724
00:34:47.779 --> 00:34:49.348
Be the first she sees
when she opens her eyes.


725
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:51.216
Got it.
Dust the first eyes you see,


726
00:34:51.249 --> 00:34:52.651
be in the front,
and stand on the one you love!


727
00:34:52.684 --> 00:34:53.852
Now, pull!

728
00:34:59.891 --> 00:35:01.793
Sunny?

729
00:34:59.891 --> 00:35:01.793
Yeah?

730
00:35:01.826 --> 00:35:03.629
I know what
set me free.


731
00:35:01.826 --> 00:35:03.629
Me.

732
00:35:03.662 --> 00:35:06.965
- Love is strange

733
00:35:09.901 --> 00:35:10.703
Oh!

734
00:35:12.337 --> 00:35:15.273
- Love

735
00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:19.845
- Is strange -

736
00:35:19.878 --> 00:35:21.179
Stop!

737
00:35:23.214 --> 00:35:25.384
Sugar Plum? She can't be.

738
00:35:27.886 --> 00:35:29.221
Now.

739
00:35:29.254 --> 00:35:31.289
Slowly.

740
00:35:31.322 --> 00:35:31.991
I'm free!

741
00:35:33.925 --> 00:35:35.427
Quiet! We're gonna
get caught!


742
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.796
I'm free!

743
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.796
Free?

744
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:38.864
We're still in the dungeon!

745
00:35:38.897 --> 00:35:40.666
Free!

746
00:35:38.897 --> 00:35:40.666
Whoa!

747
00:35:40.699 --> 00:35:42.300
Totally nuts.

748
00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:43.935
I'm free.
Did I mention I'm free?


749
00:35:43.968 --> 00:35:44.903
Quietly.

750
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:47.973
Wait!

751
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:47.973
What? Where?

752
00:35:48.006 --> 00:35:50.175
How did you find me?

753
00:35:48.006 --> 00:35:50.175
An imp.

754
00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:52.244
The imp?
Oh, he wants the potion.


755
00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:54.046
Loves to spread it around

756
00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.280
like goblin dung.

757
00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.280
Ugh!

758
00:35:55.313 --> 00:35:56.782
Hey!

759
00:35:55.313 --> 00:35:56.782
What?

760
00:35:56.815 --> 00:35:58.750
Never let this imp

761
00:35:58.783 --> 00:36:00.819
get that potion!

762
00:36:00.852 --> 00:36:01.420
Okay.

763
00:36:07.258 --> 00:36:08.794
No, no, no.

764
00:36:08.827 --> 00:36:09.995
Thang, sound the alarm.

765
00:36:11.396 --> 00:36:13.031
I'm sorry.

766
00:36:13.064 --> 00:36:14.833
Stuff! Sound the alarm!

767
00:36:19.003 --> 00:36:20.105
Whoa!

768
00:36:20.138 --> 00:36:21.273
I'm free!

769
00:36:20.138 --> 00:36:21.273
No, no!

770
00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:22.741
She's free?

771
00:36:22.774 --> 00:36:24.943
I'm free!

772
00:36:24.976 --> 00:36:27.145
Excuse me, coming through.
Sorry.


773
00:36:27.178 --> 00:36:29.381
All-righty. Excuse me.

774
00:36:29.414 --> 00:36:31.116
Sunny! Hurry!

775
00:36:34.753 --> 00:36:36.188
Oopsie.

776
00:36:36.221 --> 00:36:37.923
Ooh!

777
00:36:36.221 --> 00:36:37.923
Stop that! Shoo! Shoo!

778
00:36:47.832 --> 00:36:49.101
Gotcha!

779
00:36:47.832 --> 00:36:49.101
Yeah!

780
00:36:49.134 --> 00:36:50.502
Huh?

781
00:36:50.535 --> 00:36:52.137
Where did he go?

782
00:36:50.535 --> 00:36:52.137
He disappeared.

783
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.739
Can elves disappear?

784
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.739
If they're magic.

785
00:36:53.772 --> 00:36:55.107
Is he magic?

786
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.875
Well, he disappeared!

787
00:36:56.908 --> 00:36:58.176
Sorry.

788
00:37:00.278 --> 00:37:01.413
This will never happen...

789
00:37:01.446 --> 00:37:02.447
No, no, no!

790
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.849
No!

791
00:37:03.882 --> 00:37:06.118
...again.

792
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:07.819
Sunny!

793
00:37:07.852 --> 00:37:09.521
Oh!

794
00:37:09.554 --> 00:37:11.523
Remember what I told you!

795
00:37:11.556 --> 00:37:12.991
Hey! Get off!

796
00:37:13.024 --> 00:37:14.193
Uh-oh.

797
00:37:15.827 --> 00:37:17.796
I'm sorry,
but I have to do this!


798
00:37:19.164 --> 00:37:20.032
The Plum warned me
about you!


799
00:37:21.533 --> 00:37:25.804
Oh, no.
Are you okay, little guy?


800
00:37:25.837 --> 00:37:27.272
Little guy?

801
00:37:27.305 --> 00:37:28.907
Oh, good. Bye!

802
00:37:34.813 --> 00:37:37.549
What did you do?

803
00:37:37.582 --> 00:37:39.384
Well, the elf asked me
to make the love potion.


804
00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:41.286
But you didn't
have a primrose petal.


805
00:37:41.319 --> 00:37:42.921
And he brought me
a primrose petal.


806
00:37:42.954 --> 00:37:44.456
You made the potion?

807
00:37:44.489 --> 00:37:46.291
Just like I did for you

808
00:37:46.324 --> 00:37:49.795
on that fateful day you never
ever, ever let me talk about.


809
00:37:49.828 --> 00:37:51.296
Where is he?

810
00:37:51.329 --> 00:37:53.532
Halfway to
the Elf Festival by now.


811
00:38:00.371 --> 00:38:03.375
Who wants to go
to a party tonight?


812
00:38:03.408 --> 00:38:04.243
Yeah!

813
00:38:21.192 --> 00:38:22.995
Booties, prepare to be shaken!

814
00:38:25.129 --> 00:38:25.964
Ha-ha!

815
00:38:29.601 --> 00:38:32.270
Okay, she's here.

816
00:38:32.303 --> 00:38:35.040
Tonight, I surely know,
she will love me.


817
00:38:36.241 --> 00:38:37.475
- I say, "Hey!"

818
00:38:37.508 --> 00:38:39.444
- I be gone today

819
00:38:39.477 --> 00:38:42.080
- But I'll be
back around the way


820
00:38:42.113 --> 00:38:44.449
- It seems like
everywhere I go


821
00:38:44.482 --> 00:38:46.518
- The more I see,
the less I know


822
00:38:46.551 --> 00:38:49.254
- But I know one thing

823
00:38:49.287 --> 00:38:51.890
- I love you

824
00:38:51.923 --> 00:38:54.159
- I love you, I love you

825
00:38:54.192 --> 00:38:55.294
- I love you

826
00:38:58.096 --> 00:39:00.298
- Been a lot of places
all around the way


827
00:39:00.331 --> 00:39:02.467
- I've seen a lot of joy
and I've seen a lot of pain


828
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.237
- But I don't want to write
a love song for the world


829
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.006
- I just want to write
a song about
a boy and a girl


830
00:39:08.039 --> 00:39:08.406
- Hear them on the corner
Always calling my name


831
00:39:08.439 --> 00:39:09.975
What?

832
00:39:10.008 --> 00:39:11.143
Hi, sweet thing.
I'm Roland.


833
00:39:11.176 --> 00:39:11.843
- The kids on the corner
playing silly games


834
00:39:11.877 --> 00:39:13.412
What's your name?

835
00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:15.781
- When I saw you
getting down, girl,
I hoped it was you


836
00:39:15.814 --> 00:39:17.349
- And when I looked into
your eyes I knew it was true


837
00:39:17.382 --> 00:39:20.218
- I say, "Hey!"
I be gone today


838
00:39:20.251 --> 00:39:21.453
- But I'll be
back around the way


839
00:39:21.486 --> 00:39:22.954
Ugh!

840
00:39:22.987 --> 00:39:24.356
- Seems like everywhere I go

841
00:39:24.389 --> 00:39:26.224
Dawn, Roland's here,

842
00:39:26.257 --> 00:39:27.893
so I'm leaving!

843
00:39:27.926 --> 00:39:29.094
Marianne!

844
00:39:29.127 --> 00:39:30.328
Ooh! I'm dancing!

845
00:39:31.696 --> 00:39:32.931
Hey, Roland!

846
00:39:32.964 --> 00:39:35.000
I wish I had boys.

847
00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:38.970
Sunny! Psst!
Sunny! Look here!


848
00:39:39.003 --> 00:39:39.638
- I say, "Hey!"
I be gone today


849
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:41.239
Sunny! Not now.

850
00:39:41.272 --> 00:39:43.642
- But I'll be
back around the way


851
00:39:43.675 --> 00:39:46.444
- It seems like
everywhere I go


852
00:39:46.477 --> 00:39:48.246
- The more I see,
the less I know


853
00:39:49.647 --> 00:39:51.149
- But I know one thing

854
00:39:51.182 --> 00:39:53.952
- I love you

855
00:39:53.985 --> 00:39:56.688
- But I know one thing
I love you


856
00:39:56.721 --> 00:39:57.456
I hate this thing!

857
00:39:59.223 --> 00:40:00.158
- I say, "Hey!"
I be gone today


858
00:40:01.526 --> 00:40:04.062
- But I'll be
back around the way


859
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.131
- It seems like
everywhere I go


860
00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:09.100
- The more I see,
the less I know


861
00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:12.537
- But I know one thing
That I love you


862
00:40:14.038 --> 00:40:15.473
- I know!

863
00:40:15.506 --> 00:40:16.608
- I love you, I love you

864
00:40:16.641 --> 00:40:17.576
- I love you -

865
00:40:19.444 --> 00:40:21.646
Ha-ha!

866
00:40:19.444 --> 00:40:21.646
Sunny! No!

867
00:40:24.148 --> 00:40:26.484
This one's too feisty.
Go get the smaller one!


868
00:40:26.517 --> 00:40:27.652
Dawn!

869
00:40:27.685 --> 00:40:30.255
Sunny! Look!

870
00:40:30.288 --> 00:40:31.690
Hi, Sunny!

871
00:40:30.288 --> 00:40:31.690
Dawn!

872
00:40:33.324 --> 00:40:35.126
Hey!

873
00:40:35.159 --> 00:40:37.262
No! Hey!

874
00:40:37.295 --> 00:40:39.597
No!

875
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.599
Love potion? No!

876
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.603
Oh, no! No!

877
00:40:46.437 --> 00:40:47.672
Guards!

878
00:40:47.705 --> 00:40:49.207
Get him!

879
00:40:47.705 --> 00:40:49.207
Got him!

880
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.109
My little girl!

881
00:40:55.146 --> 00:40:56.614
Daddy!

882
00:40:56.647 --> 00:40:57.682
Daddy! Help!

883
00:40:57.715 --> 00:40:58.617
Dawn!

884
00:40:59.717 --> 00:41:00.485
Oh, no!

885
00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:05.690
I'm sorry,
Sugar Plum Fairy.


886
00:41:05.723 --> 00:41:08.627
Where's my potion?

887
00:41:10.762 --> 00:41:14.399
- I've been mistreated

888
00:41:17.268 --> 00:41:20.539
- I've been abused

889
00:41:26.144 --> 00:41:28.279
- I've been trespassed

890
00:41:28.312 --> 00:41:30.215
- And invaded

891
00:41:31.682 --> 00:41:34.519
- And I am not amused

892
00:41:34.552 --> 00:41:36.121
Dawn! No!

893
00:41:40.358 --> 00:41:44.195
- I've been insulted

894
00:41:44.228 --> 00:41:46.498
- Disrespected

895
00:41:47.665 --> 00:41:52.371
- I've been mistreated

896
00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.311
Release my sister,
you scaly-backed cockroach!


897
00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:03.381
Whoa.

898
00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:03.381
Huh?

899
00:42:03.414 --> 00:42:07.685
Return the love potion
by moondown, tough girl.


900
00:42:07.718 --> 00:42:11.322
Or you'll never see
your sister again.


901
00:42:11.355 --> 00:42:13.691
I'll have your
head on a stick!


902
00:42:18.663 --> 00:42:19.664
Take me instead!

903
00:42:20.698 --> 00:42:21.800
I took the love potion!

904
00:42:21.833 --> 00:42:23.168
Sunny!

905
00:42:23.201 --> 00:42:25.103
Then give it back.

906
00:42:25.136 --> 00:42:26.605
I don't have it.

907
00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:29.574
You heard my terms.

908
00:42:29.607 --> 00:42:33.445
By moondown,
or all of you will be next!


909
00:42:33.478 --> 00:42:37.549
- I've been insulted

910
00:42:37.582 --> 00:42:40.718
- Disrespected

911
00:42:40.751 --> 00:42:43.154
- I've been mistreated

912
00:42:48.192 --> 00:42:52.230
- I've been insulted

913
00:42:52.263 --> 00:42:54.399
- Disrespected

914
00:42:57.335 --> 00:43:01.540
- I've been mistreated -

915
00:43:10.448 --> 00:43:11.349
A-ha!

916
00:43:17.522 --> 00:43:19.124
Dad?

917
00:43:19.157 --> 00:43:20.592
I forbid you to fly
into the Dark Forest!


918
00:43:20.625 --> 00:43:22.393
Dad, I let this happen!

919
00:43:22.426 --> 00:43:24.329
I have to get her back.

920
00:43:24.362 --> 00:43:26.832
I have to get her back.
I have to keep you safe.


921
00:43:29.367 --> 00:43:30.535
No need to worry.

922
00:43:30.568 --> 00:43:32.670
I will save the princess!

923
00:43:32.703 --> 00:43:34.472
I was just fighting
a dozen goblins.


924
00:43:34.505 --> 00:43:36.541
Roland! Yes!

925
00:43:34.505 --> 00:43:36.541
Oh, no!

926
00:43:36.574 --> 00:43:38.309
What do you need?

927
00:43:36.574 --> 00:43:38.309
I need an army.

928
00:43:38.342 --> 00:43:39.911
Oh! We can't trust him!

929
00:43:39.944 --> 00:43:41.646
And weapons!

930
00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:42.881
And a trebuchet!

931
00:43:42.914 --> 00:43:44.215
Sunny!

932
00:43:42.914 --> 00:43:44.215
What?

933
00:43:44.248 --> 00:43:45.517
What were...

934
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.851
And a mace.
And a crossbow.


935
00:43:46.884 --> 00:43:48.153
What were you thinking?

936
00:43:48.753 --> 00:43:50.321
I don't know.

937
00:43:50.354 --> 00:43:53.424
What do we do? We have to...

938
00:43:53.457 --> 00:43:56.394
Dawn. She's not strong enough.
She's not going to...


939
00:43:56.427 --> 00:43:57.695
I'll rescue her.

940
00:43:57.728 --> 00:43:59.297
No! No, it's too dangerous.

941
00:44:00.198 --> 00:44:01.366
No, but I can.

942
00:44:01.399 --> 00:44:02.267
No.

943
00:44:03.734 --> 00:44:05.770
I'm the only one who can.

944
00:44:05.803 --> 00:44:07.305
So what do I do?

945
00:44:07.338 --> 00:44:09.674
You get the potion back.

946
00:44:09.707 --> 00:44:11.609
I'll get my sister!

947
00:44:13.244 --> 00:44:15.380
Marianne!

948
00:44:17.882 --> 00:44:21.252
Looks like I gotta
rescue two princesses.


949
00:44:21.285 --> 00:44:22.453
Sunny!

950
00:44:21.285 --> 00:44:22.453
What?

951
00:44:22.486 --> 00:44:25.356
If anything happens
to my daughters,


952
00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:28.193
I'm holding you
personally responsible!


953
00:44:28.226 --> 00:44:29.460
Uh...

954
00:44:29.493 --> 00:44:30.862
This is all your fault!

955
00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:35.266
You nearly got
everyone killed!


956
00:44:35.299 --> 00:44:36.301
Yeah!

957
00:44:36.334 --> 00:44:38.336
I know. I know.

958
00:44:38.369 --> 00:44:39.571
But look.

959
00:44:39.604 --> 00:44:42.207
Dawn, now,
she's my best friend.


960
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.509
But she's our princess!

961
00:44:44.542 --> 00:44:46.511
Now, together we must...
No, no, no.


962
00:44:46.544 --> 00:44:49.447
Together we will rescue Dawn

963
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.848
from the cruel grasp
of the Dark Forest.


964
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:51.950
Who's with me?

965
00:44:58.522 --> 00:44:59.925
No volunteers?

966
00:45:00.758 --> 00:45:01.660
Pare!

967
00:45:03.794 --> 00:45:04.896
Thanks, man!

968
00:45:04.929 --> 00:45:05.764
Um...

969
00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:09.301
Uh-oh.

970
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:21.546
Bring me

971
00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:24.282
the prisoner.

972
00:45:27.752 --> 00:45:29.320
I get to rip
her wings off!


973
00:45:29.353 --> 00:45:30.622
I want
the wishbone.


974
00:45:30.655 --> 00:45:32.023
No eating!

975
00:45:33.591 --> 00:45:34.926
Brutus.

976
00:45:35.493 --> 00:45:36.561
Oh!

977
00:45:46.604 --> 00:45:48.940
So, what do we have here?

978
00:45:51.442 --> 00:45:54.946
- Sugar pie, honey bunch

979
00:45:55.713 --> 00:45:57.048
What?

980
00:45:57.081 --> 00:46:01.986
- You know that I love you

981
00:46:02.019 --> 00:46:03.421
- I can't help myself

982
00:46:04.789 --> 00:46:06.357
Huh?

983
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.329
- I love you
and nobody else -


984
00:46:14.565 --> 00:46:16.668
- But I'm evil

985
00:46:18.469 --> 00:46:22.641
- My middle name is misery

986
00:46:24.709 --> 00:46:27.679
- Yes, I'm evil

987
00:46:27.712 --> 00:46:30.915
- So don't you
mess around with me -


988
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.085
Oh, silly.

989
00:46:34.118 --> 00:46:35.853
- Sugar pie, honey bunch

990
00:46:35.886 --> 00:46:37.088
Stop that!

991
00:46:37.121 --> 00:46:39.857
- You know that I love you

992
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.092
And stop that!

993
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:42.794
- I can't help myself

994
00:46:42.827 --> 00:46:46.798
I'm a sucker
for sweet, pretty singing.


995
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:48.599
Shut it off! Shut it off!

996
00:46:51.635 --> 00:46:53.404
- When I call your name

997
00:46:53.437 --> 00:46:55.573
- Boy, it starts a flame

998
00:46:55.606 --> 00:46:57.108
- Burning in my heart
Tearing it apart


999
00:46:57.141 --> 00:46:59.477
The potion.
The potion!


1000
00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:00.945
We should have
taken the feisty one!


1001
00:47:00.978 --> 00:47:03.414
Get the Sugar Plum!

1002
00:47:03.447 --> 00:47:04.949
What's he talking about?

1003
00:47:04.982 --> 00:47:06.518
I can't hear
over that singing!


1004
00:47:07.585 --> 00:47:09.687
Uh-uh.

1005
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.757
- Ooh, I can't help myself

1006
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:16.661
- I love you
and nobody else


1007
00:47:16.694 --> 00:47:19.364
- No, I can't help myself -

1008
00:47:19.397 --> 00:47:20.832
Take her!

1009
00:47:20.865 --> 00:47:23.067
And lock this
crazy creature
in the dungeon!


1010
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.802
She is crazy

1011
00:47:24.835 --> 00:47:26.671
in love with you!

1012
00:47:26.704 --> 00:47:28.840
Do I hear wedding bells?

1013
00:47:28.873 --> 00:47:29.774
- Sugar pie, honey bunch

1014
00:47:29.807 --> 00:47:31.576
I hate princesses.

1015
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:33.444
- You know that
I love you -


1016
00:47:35.513 --> 00:47:39.484
Careful! She's our bait.

1017
00:47:35.513 --> 00:47:39.484
Oh, well...

1018
00:47:39.517 --> 00:47:42.387
If I have to look
under every rock,


1019
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.690
I won't let you
die sad and alone.


1020
00:47:45.723 --> 00:47:48.993
Bring me Sugar Plum!

1021
00:48:03.474 --> 00:48:06.111
- There's no way

1022
00:48:07.745 --> 00:48:10.715
- I'm gonna sit this one out

1023
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:16.454
- I gotta take a chance now

1024
00:48:16.487 --> 00:48:19.124
- Not be a prisoner of doubt

1025
00:48:20.891 --> 00:48:23.061
- I'm comin' -

1026
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:28.666
Whoa!

1027
00:48:29.233 --> 00:48:30.001
Ugh!

1028
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.035
Whoo!

1029
00:49:04.068 --> 00:49:06.971
Well, you wanted adventure,

1030
00:49:07.004 --> 00:49:09.774
and now you got it.

1031
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:27.792
You ready?

1032
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:27.792
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:49:27.825 --> 00:49:30.028
Take the other side!
Wait for my signal!


1034
00:49:33.797 --> 00:49:34.666
Now!

1035
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.819
Ahh! Mmm-mmm.

1036
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.819
Huh?

1037
00:49:54.852 --> 00:49:56.120
No, he didn't. Huh?

1038
00:49:54.852 --> 00:49:56.120
Oh, that's nasty.

1039
00:50:00.624 --> 00:50:03.928
Oh, man. At least
it can't get any worse.


1040
00:50:03.961 --> 00:50:05.029
It just did.

1041
00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:10.701
Oh! So, your eye seems
to be healing pretty good.


1042
00:50:17.942 --> 00:50:19.711
Uh! Okay. Stop that!

1043
00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:25.850
Aw!

1044
00:50:25.883 --> 00:50:27.051
Crazy little thing.

1045
00:50:25.883 --> 00:50:27.051
He's kind of cute.

1046
00:50:28.686 --> 00:50:29.854
Hey!

1047
00:50:29.887 --> 00:50:32.657
I think she likes us!

1048
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.691
Come back here!

1049
00:50:36.827 --> 00:50:40.665
- No, I can't
forget this evening


1050
00:50:40.698 --> 00:50:43.868
- Or your face
as you were leaving


1051
00:50:45.002 --> 00:50:46.637
Oh, don't let

1052
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.173
her sunny sweetness
flamflumble you.


1053
00:50:49.206 --> 00:50:51.008
Not your type.

1054
00:50:51.041 --> 00:50:54.846
Now, I've found someone
who is positively
perfect for you.


1055
00:50:56.213 --> 00:50:57.915
Not now, Mother.

1056
00:50:57.948 --> 00:50:59.350
- Yes, it shows -

1057
00:50:59.383 --> 00:51:00.918
Eh! I'm not giving up!

1058
00:51:02.186 --> 00:51:03.654
Finally.

1059
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.592
Griselda.

1060
00:51:07.625 --> 00:51:09.327
Plum.

1061
00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.995
It's so amusing
how you keep trying.


1062
00:51:11.028 --> 00:51:12.930
Hmm, you're one to talk,

1063
00:51:12.963 --> 00:51:16.067
with your magic
recipe for failure!


1064
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.036
Well, the recipe's
working now! Isn't it?


1065
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:20.237
Oh, it works.

1066
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.173
I need the antidote!

1067
00:51:22.206 --> 00:51:24.208
Oh, it works? Pah!

1068
00:51:24.241 --> 00:51:25.743
Then explain what
happened to this one.


1069
00:51:27.378 --> 00:51:30.214
Oh, you have
your father's smile!


1070
00:51:30.247 --> 00:51:33.184
Wait. I know this song!
Cover up!


1071
00:51:33.217 --> 00:51:37.388
- I can't live
if living is without you


1072
00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:39.123
Give me the antidote!

1073
00:51:39.156 --> 00:51:42.360
And what will you do
if I refuse? Lock me away?


1074
00:51:42.393 --> 00:51:43.894
- I can't live -

1075
00:51:45.129 --> 00:51:47.298
I can't live!

1076
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:50.267
Everybody, be quiet!

1077
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.702
Kill me!

1078
00:51:51.735 --> 00:51:52.837
I'll do it myself!

1079
00:52:01.345 --> 00:52:03.381
Ooh!

1080
00:52:03.414 --> 00:52:06.817
If you don't keep
your mouth shut,


1081
00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.754
I'm going to rip
your wings off,


1082
00:52:09.787 --> 00:52:12.657
my pretty little
fairy princess!


1083
00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:13.858
Ha-ha! Flirt!

1084
00:52:14.892 --> 00:52:16.827
What is that?

1085
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.329
I made it special for you.

1086
00:52:18.362 --> 00:52:20.731
For me?

1087
00:52:20.764 --> 00:52:22.366
It looks good on you.

1088
00:52:22.399 --> 00:52:24.335
Uh, I don't...

1089
00:52:24.368 --> 00:52:26.204
I hope you like it.

1090
00:52:24.368 --> 00:52:26.204
This isn't...

1091
00:52:28.372 --> 00:52:31.275
Well, um, thank you.

1092
00:52:31.308 --> 00:52:32.777
It's, uh...

1093
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:34.178
It's lovely.

1094
00:52:34.211 --> 00:52:35.780
- Sugar pie, honey bunch

1095
00:52:35.813 --> 00:52:37.114
No, no, no!

1096
00:52:37.147 --> 00:52:38.683
- You know that I love you

1097
00:52:38.716 --> 00:52:40.718
What you're feeling
is the potion, you know!


1098
00:52:40.751 --> 00:52:41.952
- I can't help myself

1099
00:52:41.985 --> 00:52:43.254
No, I suppose you don't.

1100
00:52:43.287 --> 00:52:44.321
- I love you
and nobody else -


1101
00:52:44.354 --> 00:52:45.423
Please, stop!

1102
00:52:50.227 --> 00:52:52.396
You must be tired
from all that singing.


1103
00:52:52.429 --> 00:52:54.331
I could sing forever.

1104
00:52:56.333 --> 00:52:58.836
Why don't you
take a wee nap?


1105
00:53:00.738 --> 00:53:01.873
I promise I won't go far.

1106
00:53:03.974 --> 00:53:04.842
Wait!

1107
00:53:07.377 --> 00:53:09.346
Please tell me your name.

1108
00:53:09.379 --> 00:53:12.383
I am the Bog King!

1109
00:53:12.416 --> 00:53:15.453
My Boggy-woggy
Kingy-wingy!


1110
00:53:15.486 --> 00:53:17.388
"Bog King!"

1111
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:18.989
Boggy Kingy-wingy.

1112
00:53:19.022 --> 00:53:20.224
"King!"

1113
00:53:19.022 --> 00:53:20.224
Kingy-wingy.

1114
00:53:20.257 --> 00:53:21.826
"King!"

1115
00:53:20.257 --> 00:53:21.826
Good night,

1116
00:53:21.859 --> 00:53:23.060
sweet Boggy-woggy.

1117
00:53:26.497 --> 00:53:27.398
Good night.

1118
00:53:31.535 --> 00:53:33.204
News, your majesty!

1119
00:53:33.237 --> 00:53:35.372
Quiet!
She's asleep.


1120
00:53:35.405 --> 00:53:38.710
Sorry. There's reports
of lots of creatures being


1121
00:53:39.476 --> 00:53:40.211
love-dusted!

1122
00:53:42.946 --> 00:53:44.082
Bring them...

1123
00:53:45.516 --> 00:53:47.184
Bring them in.

1124
00:53:47.217 --> 00:53:50.722
Bring them all in here.

1125
00:53:58.428 --> 00:53:59.497
Ah!

1126
00:54:01.431 --> 00:54:02.467
Oh!

1127
00:54:04.568 --> 00:54:06.104
There you are!

1128
00:54:14.478 --> 00:54:16.213
You go that way.
I'm going this way!


1129
00:54:16.246 --> 00:54:17.381
Yeah.

1130
00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:20.951
Whoo!

1131
00:54:28.192 --> 00:54:29.026
Ha-ha!

1132
00:54:37.901 --> 00:54:39.436
Hey, you!

1133
00:54:37.901 --> 00:54:39.436
Hmm?

1134
00:54:39.469 --> 00:54:41.338
No, no, no.
Not you, Lizzie.


1135
00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:43.073
That little thing inside.

1136
00:54:43.106 --> 00:54:44.542
We caught you
fair and square!


1137
00:54:44.575 --> 00:54:45.443
Hand it over!

1138
00:54:46.443 --> 00:54:48.012
Hmm...

1139
00:54:48.045 --> 00:54:49.947
Oh, yeah, sure.
Go ahead and think.


1140
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.016
I'll just wait for you at
the other end of the lizard.


1141
00:54:55.519 --> 00:54:56.987
Thanks!

1142
00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.022
Spit.

1143
00:54:59.556 --> 00:55:02.593
- This thing called love

1144
00:55:02.626 --> 00:55:04.128
- I just can't handle it

1145
00:55:04.161 --> 00:55:05.896
Who's a good girl?

1146
00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:06.864
- This thing called love

1147
00:55:06.897 --> 00:55:07.998
You're a good girl!

1148
00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:09.300
Don't you feel special?

1149
00:55:09.333 --> 00:55:10.234
- I must get around to it

1150
00:55:11.602 --> 00:55:14.138
- I ain't ready

1151
00:55:14.171 --> 00:55:16.207
- Crazy little thing
called love -


1152
00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:24.181
Okay!
Let's go fetch Dawn.


1153
00:55:24.214 --> 00:55:25.516
Who's a good girl?

1154
00:55:29.319 --> 00:55:33.090
In such dark as this,
we must be ever vigilant.


1155
00:55:33.123 --> 00:55:33.991
Clear!

1156
00:55:34.024 --> 00:55:35.626
Clear!

1157
00:55:35.659 --> 00:55:37.895
Clearing is exactly
what we're gonna do
to this foul forest.


1158
00:55:37.928 --> 00:55:39.496
We're gonna...

1159
00:55:37.928 --> 00:55:39.496
Get ya!

1160
00:55:39.529 --> 00:55:42.233
Stealthily,
we shall sneak up on...


1161
00:55:44.134 --> 00:55:47.037
Who would live in this?

1162
00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:48.138
Wipe that off, will you?

1163
00:55:49.573 --> 00:55:51.876
And, lo,
a creature with no face.


1164
00:55:51.909 --> 00:55:53.143
It's looking at me.

1165
00:55:53.176 --> 00:55:54.078
I don't think
that's possible.


1166
00:55:54.111 --> 00:55:55.312
Good point!

1167
00:55:55.345 --> 00:55:58.649
Watch for grotesqueries
at every corner.


1168
00:55:58.682 --> 00:56:02.052
Imagine the most
unimaginable danger.


1169
00:56:04.388 --> 00:56:05.056
That's probably nothing.

1170
00:56:08.025 --> 00:56:10.194
Whoo-hoo!

1171
00:56:13.297 --> 00:56:14.665
Hey, Roland!

1172
00:56:14.698 --> 00:56:16.667
Thank you!

1173
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.269
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.


1174
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.269
Wait, wait!

1175
00:56:18.302 --> 00:56:20.604
How did you get that to...

1176
00:56:20.637 --> 00:56:22.139
She fell in love
with me!


1177
00:56:22.172 --> 00:56:24.074
Me, too!

1178
00:56:24.107 --> 00:56:26.210
Is that wrong?

1179
00:56:26.243 --> 00:56:28.245
I got the love potion.

1180
00:56:29.479 --> 00:56:32.416
Wow! Yeah, wow!

1181
00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:35.286
You must really
need that potion.


1182
00:56:35.319 --> 00:56:37.454
Wait! I got it for...

1183
00:56:37.487 --> 00:56:41.158
Dawn! You got it
for Princess Dawn.
Winky-winky.


1184
00:56:42.526 --> 00:56:46.363
And well done,
for a little guy.


1185
00:56:46.396 --> 00:56:49.233
Squish!

1186
00:56:49.266 --> 00:56:52.002
I got it... I got it...

1187
00:56:52.035 --> 00:56:54.204
I got it for Dawn.

1188
00:56:54.237 --> 00:56:56.106
I better take that

1189
00:56:56.139 --> 00:56:57.541
to keep it safe.

1190
00:56:58.642 --> 00:57:01.011
Thank you, tiny rabbit!

1191
00:57:01.044 --> 00:57:01.946
Whoa!

1192
00:57:03.747 --> 00:57:05.950
It's almost moondown.

1193
00:57:05.983 --> 00:57:08.052
Hold on, Dawn. I'm coming!

1194
00:57:08.085 --> 00:57:10.021
Okay, okay!
Yes! I love her!


1195
00:57:11.054 --> 00:57:12.656
You know! Ha-ha-ha!

1196
00:57:12.689 --> 00:57:14.091
Come on, Lizzie! Let's go!

1197
00:57:15.659 --> 00:57:16.594
Halt!

1198
00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:21.499
March!

1199
00:57:23.767 --> 00:57:25.569
I lead!

1200
00:57:25.602 --> 00:57:26.637
Okay! Okay.

1201
00:57:30.374 --> 00:57:32.576
We're gonna get ya!

1202
00:57:32.609 --> 00:57:34.278
Help me!

1203
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:48.192
Help!

1204
00:57:49.626 --> 00:57:51.528
Mushrooms in love!

1205
00:57:56.033 --> 00:57:57.634
Ooh! Kiss me. Quick!

1206
00:57:57.667 --> 00:58:00.037
No smooching!

1207
00:58:01.138 --> 00:58:02.039
Ugh.

1208
00:58:08.645 --> 00:58:10.347
Shush him.

1209
00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.348
You shush him!

1210
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:12.649
You're closer.

1211
00:58:12.682 --> 00:58:14.184
You're right. Shush!

1212
00:58:15.752 --> 00:58:20.090
So, why don't you go
and get some sleep?


1213
00:58:20.123 --> 00:58:21.258
What were
you thinking?


1214
00:58:21.291 --> 00:58:23.027
Don't hate me.

1215
00:58:21.291 --> 00:58:23.027
Too late.

1216
00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.561
And leave me alone.

1217
00:58:24.594 --> 00:58:26.196
Nice button-ere.

1218
00:58:27.798 --> 00:58:30.467
Not "button-ere."
"Boutonniere."


1219
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:31.802
No,
it's not "boutonniere."


1220
00:58:31.835 --> 00:58:33.537
It's "button-ere."

1221
00:58:31.835 --> 00:58:33.537
It's "boutonniere."

1222
00:58:34.504 --> 00:58:35.473
Okay.

1223
00:58:40.644 --> 00:58:41.712
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1224
00:58:41.745 --> 00:58:44.681
Release my sister.

1225
00:58:44.714 --> 00:58:47.785
Oh, no!
Not another princess!


1226
00:58:47.818 --> 00:58:50.721
Well, at least
you're not singing.


1227
00:58:50.754 --> 00:58:53.257
- I'm coming
straight on for you


1228
00:58:54.524 --> 00:58:57.694
- I've made up my mind

1229
00:58:57.727 --> 00:58:59.296
Taking a little break?

1230
00:58:59.329 --> 00:59:01.498
- I'm feeling strong now

1231
00:59:01.531 --> 00:59:03.534
- Now I'm coming through

1232
00:59:01.531 --> 00:59:03.534
Well...

1233
00:59:03.567 --> 00:59:04.535
Need any help, sire?

1234
00:59:04.568 --> 00:59:05.536
No.

1235
00:59:11.875 --> 00:59:15.712
- I'm coming
straight on for you


1236
00:59:15.745 --> 00:59:17.681
- Yeah! Straight on for you

1237
00:59:17.714 --> 00:59:19.783
Impressive!

1238
00:59:19.816 --> 00:59:22.486
- I'm coming
straight on for you -


1239
00:59:26.723 --> 00:59:28.059
Uh-oh.

1240
00:59:32.729 --> 00:59:34.798
- Rock-a-bye, fairy
Away in your cell


1241
00:59:34.831 --> 00:59:36.534
- Scream your head off
But no one can tell -


1242
00:59:38.702 --> 00:59:40.671
Had enough?

1243
00:59:40.704 --> 00:59:42.573
I could
do this all day.


1244
00:59:44.174 --> 00:59:47.344
But now, give me
the potion!


1245
00:59:47.377 --> 00:59:51.782
The almighty Bog King
needs a magic love potion.


1246
00:59:51.815 --> 00:59:54.885
I don't need it!
I want to eradicate it!


1247
00:59:54.918 --> 00:59:56.754
Well, eradicate this!

1248
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.559
Ask him.
He'll appreciate it.


1249
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.559
Okay. Need any help?

1250
01:00:02.592 --> 01:00:03.394
No!

1251
01:00:07.664 --> 01:00:09.633
Look at you!

1252
01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:10.534
Whoa!

1253
01:00:15.872 --> 01:00:16.640
Not bad.

1254
01:00:18.508 --> 01:00:19.209
Looks like
you need help.


1255
01:00:19.242 --> 01:00:20.111
No!

1256
01:00:21.444 --> 01:00:22.313
Ha!

1257
01:00:23.246 --> 01:00:24.381
Ha-ha!

1258
01:00:24.414 --> 01:00:25.582
Ah-ha!

1259
01:00:26.783 --> 01:00:29.153
So, is that all you got?

1260
01:00:29.186 --> 01:00:31.122
- Now I know

1261
01:00:33.423 --> 01:00:36.460
- How to play my hand

1262
01:00:36.493 --> 01:00:38.462
Well, I'm ready for you!

1263
01:00:38.495 --> 01:00:43.534
- What the winner don't know,
the gambler understands


1264
01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:45.769
What does that even mean?

1265
01:00:45.802 --> 01:00:48.372
- No!
You don't stand a chance


1266
01:00:48.405 --> 01:00:51.842
- You don't stand a chance

1267
01:00:53.743 --> 01:00:56.280
- I'm coming
straight on for you


1268
01:00:56.313 --> 01:00:57.848
Ooh!

1269
01:00:56.313 --> 01:00:57.848
Ah!

1270
01:00:57.881 --> 01:01:00.217
You fight well,
for a fairy.


1271
01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:01.885
Wish I could say
the same for you!


1272
01:01:01.918 --> 01:01:03.520
What do you mean?

1273
01:01:03.553 --> 01:01:05.890
I don't know.
I was expecting more.


1274
01:01:08.425 --> 01:01:09.894
- Straight on for you

1275
01:01:11.962 --> 01:01:13.730
- Straight on for you

1276
01:01:13.763 --> 01:01:15.732
- Straight on for you

1277
01:01:15.765 --> 01:01:16.667
- Straight on for you -

1278
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.635
Oh.

1279
01:01:30.313 --> 01:01:31.381
Go ahead.

1280
01:01:31.414 --> 01:01:32.950
Kill me,

1281
01:01:32.983 --> 01:01:34.552
but you won't
get your sister.


1282
01:01:36.953 --> 01:01:37.755
Need any help?

1283
01:01:39.022 --> 01:01:40.457
No!

1284
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.426
- Wise men say

1285
01:01:45.262 --> 01:01:46.330
- Only fools rush in

1286
01:01:47.631 --> 01:01:49.333
The beast has awoken.

1287
01:01:49.366 --> 01:01:50.767
Oh, no.

1288
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.536
What did she
fall in love with?


1289
01:01:52.569 --> 01:01:54.572
Would you care to see?

1290
01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.212
- Falling in love with you

1291
01:02:01.911 --> 01:02:03.947
Finally.

1292
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:07.351
- Like a river flows

1293
01:02:07.384 --> 01:02:09.286
See what happens

1294
01:02:09.319 --> 01:02:12.389
when love is
loosed upon the world?


1295
01:02:12.422 --> 01:02:15.926
- Fools rush in

1296
01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:21.265
- Would it be a sin? -

1297
01:02:21.298 --> 01:02:22.533
Ew.

1298
01:02:25.302 --> 01:02:26.970
Tell them to be quiet.

1299
01:02:25.302 --> 01:02:26.970
You tell them.

1300
01:02:27.003 --> 01:02:28.805
Your voice cuts through
better than mine.


1301
01:02:28.838 --> 01:02:31.908
That's true. Quiet!
Everybody be quiet!


1302
01:02:31.941 --> 01:02:33.777
Be quiet! Be quiet!

1303
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.847
Quiet!

1304
01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.549
Quiet! Quiet!

1305
01:02:39.582 --> 01:02:41.318
Sorry.

1306
01:02:41.351 --> 01:02:43.920
I hope you've got
a strong stomach.


1307
01:02:43.953 --> 01:02:45.322
- Sugar pie, honey bunch

1308
01:02:48.525 --> 01:02:50.027
- You know that I love... -

1309
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.628
You?

1310
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.628
Yes.

1311
01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:53.764
Antidote?

1312
01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:53.764
Working on it.

1313
01:02:53.797 --> 01:02:55.299
I know she's a girl
who falls in love with
every guy she sees,


1314
01:02:56.666 --> 01:02:57.701
but this is ridiculous!

1315
01:02:57.734 --> 01:02:58.502
I, um...

1316
01:03:00.103 --> 01:03:02.439
Sire! I forgot
to mention,


1317
01:03:02.472 --> 01:03:04.541
you forgot your
weapon upstairs.


1318
01:03:04.574 --> 01:03:06.677
But I found
your boutonniere!


1319
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:07.978
Hi.

1320
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:07.978
You know,

1321
01:03:08.011 --> 01:03:10.747
I really enjoyed our fight,

1322
01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.517
but I'll be taking
my sister home now.


1323
01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:14.518
Oh, no,
you're not!


1324
01:03:15.518 --> 01:03:16.520
Dawn!

1325
01:03:17.587 --> 01:03:18.522
Boggy-bear!

1326
01:03:18.555 --> 01:03:19.423
"Bog King!"

1327
01:03:21.891 --> 01:03:24.628
Let's go back
to our cell. Shall we?


1328
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:26.830
Anything for you,
Boggy-woggy.


1329
01:03:26.863 --> 01:03:28.432
Uh, "Bog."

1330
01:03:28.465 --> 01:03:29.866
Don't listen to him!

1331
01:03:29.899 --> 01:03:31.835
You are not
the boss of me!


1332
01:03:31.868 --> 01:03:33.670
And don't even think
about stealing my Boggy!


1333
01:03:33.703 --> 01:03:34.571
"Bog!"

1334
01:03:36.906 --> 01:03:40.477
She stays here until
I get the potion back.


1335
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:43.580
Forget the potion.
Get the antidote, now!


1336
01:03:43.613 --> 01:03:45.716
Well, maybe
you should ask her.


1337
01:03:45.749 --> 01:03:47.584
"Her"? Who?

1338
01:03:47.617 --> 01:03:49.853
The Sugar Plum Fairy.

1339
01:03:49.886 --> 01:03:51.388
Ooh! Welcome!

1340
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:52.789
Give me the antidote.

1341
01:03:52.822 --> 01:03:54.524
If you let me talk
about that fateful...


1342
01:03:54.557 --> 01:03:56.493
No!

1343
01:03:54.557 --> 01:03:56.493
Then, no.

1344
01:03:56.526 --> 01:03:59.963
Please! I love my sister.
I need that antidote.


1345
01:03:59.996 --> 01:04:00.931
Okay! I'll just need
a few things.


1346
01:04:00.964 --> 01:04:02.899
What?

1347
01:04:02.932 --> 01:04:05.068
An eye of newt,
a golden lute,
a loom and a flute.


1348
01:04:05.101 --> 01:04:06.737
Get those things.

1349
01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:07.671
And green beans,

1350
01:04:07.704 --> 01:04:08.939
a nail file, a tangelo...

1351
01:04:08.972 --> 01:04:11.141
Hey, will it really work?

1352
01:04:11.174 --> 01:04:13.643
Eh, who knows?

1353
01:04:13.676 --> 01:04:15.479
And you are?

1354
01:04:13.676 --> 01:04:15.479
My mother.

1355
01:04:15.512 --> 01:04:16.347
Griselda.

1356
01:04:18.014 --> 01:04:19.916
Don't
you have a comb?


1357
01:04:21.951 --> 01:04:25.021
It's drafty down here.
Come upstairs.
There's snacks.


1358
01:04:25.054 --> 01:04:27.691
Well...

1359
01:04:27.724 --> 01:04:31.461
- I got a feeling

1360
01:04:31.494 --> 01:04:34.064
It's the best I could do
on such short notice.


1361
01:04:34.097 --> 01:04:37.034
- That tonight's
gonna be a good night


1362
01:04:39.569 --> 01:04:42.172
- That tonight's
gonna be a good night


1363
01:04:42.205 --> 01:04:43.907
You two behave.

1364
01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.809
Toodle-oo!

1365
01:04:45.842 --> 01:04:47.177
- That tonight's
gonna be a good...


1366
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.978
Stop.

1367
01:04:49.712 --> 01:04:53.150
- ...night! Yeah -

1368
01:04:53.183 --> 01:04:54.851
Go see if
the antidote's ready.


1369
01:04:54.884 --> 01:04:56.486
Roger, B.K.

1370
01:04:56.519 --> 01:04:57.587
And here's
your boutonniere.


1371
01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.822
Quickly!

1372
01:04:58.855 --> 01:05:00.791
You sang pretty good.

1373
01:05:00.824 --> 01:05:02.159
You should see me dance.

1374
01:05:00.824 --> 01:05:02.159
I'd love to.

1375
01:05:02.192 --> 01:05:03.427
Why would she...

1376
01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.462
Oh.

1377
01:05:06.062 --> 01:05:07.931
Oh!

1378
01:05:07.964 --> 01:05:10.167
Who likes this?

1379
01:05:07.964 --> 01:05:10.167
Not me!

1380
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.768
I hate it!

1381
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.768
I hate it more!

1382
01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:12.803
Oh, yeah?

1383
01:05:13.636 --> 01:05:15.105
They're all fools!

1384
01:05:15.138 --> 01:05:16.873
Rushing in.

1385
01:05:16.906 --> 01:05:18.775
They can't help it!

1386
01:05:18.808 --> 01:05:19.910
They're in chains...

1387
01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.712
That bind you!

1388
01:05:22.745 --> 01:05:23.880
It's nothing but...

1389
01:05:23.913 --> 01:05:25.816
Trouble!

1390
01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:28.051
It's like their middle name
is misery.


1391
01:05:29.552 --> 01:05:30.854
Well...

1392
01:05:30.887 --> 01:05:32.923
What's the point?

1393
01:05:32.956 --> 01:05:34.057
Bursting bubbles!

1394
01:05:36.926 --> 01:05:38.429
That's what they get.

1395
01:05:36.926 --> 01:05:38.429
Lies

1396
01:05:39.262 --> 01:05:40.130
and more lies!

1397
01:05:42.565 --> 01:05:43.834
Pain!

1398
01:05:44.834 --> 01:05:46.136
Sorrows!

1399
01:05:47.504 --> 01:05:48.839
Wait!

1400
01:05:48.872 --> 01:05:51.842
I, uh, actually
like this one.


1401
01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:54.044
Oh! Why?

1402
01:05:54.077 --> 01:05:56.613
I... I don't know.

1403
01:05:56.646 --> 01:05:58.215
Well, it's...

1404
01:05:59.582 --> 01:06:00.784
It's

1405
01:06:01.651 --> 01:06:03.487
lovely.

1406
01:06:04.954 --> 01:06:06.890
I don't wanna
be carrying this.


1407
01:06:06.923 --> 01:06:08.792
Antidote's ready, sire.

1408
01:06:08.825 --> 01:06:10.727
Well? Where is it?

1409
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.828
It's a riddle!

1410
01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:13.630
A riddle?

1411
01:06:13.663 --> 01:06:15.665
What about all that
stuff you asked for?


1412
01:06:15.698 --> 01:06:17.734
Well, you know, in prison,
it's hard to shop!


1413
01:06:17.767 --> 01:06:19.903
Would you like to
hear the riddle, or not?


1414
01:06:19.936 --> 01:06:21.004
No!

1415
01:06:19.936 --> 01:06:21.004
Yes!

1416
01:06:21.037 --> 01:06:22.772
Then listen carefully.

1417
01:06:24.274 --> 01:06:26.009
The antidote

1418
01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:28.979
is the one thing
more powerful
than the potion.


1419
01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:34.985
Did she say "antidote"
or "anecdote"?


1420
01:06:36.052 --> 01:06:39.055
I hate riddles!

1421
01:06:44.027 --> 01:06:46.029
The moon
is sinking fast.


1422
01:06:46.062 --> 01:06:48.798
Can we go
maybe a lot faster?


1423
01:06:48.831 --> 01:06:50.700
Halt!

1424
01:06:48.831 --> 01:06:50.700
What?

1425
01:06:50.733 --> 01:06:52.002
Oh, wow!

1426
01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.276
Did you see that?

1427
01:06:59.309 --> 01:07:03.813
I believe that is
the ugliest creature
I have ever seen!


1428
01:07:05.114 --> 01:07:07.284
And it was naked!

1429
01:07:12.255 --> 01:07:15.058
An army approaches.

1430
01:07:26.002 --> 01:07:27.905
Got it! Yes!

1431
01:07:29.372 --> 01:07:30.574
What was that again?

1432
01:07:32.642 --> 01:07:34.878
Something more powerful...

1433
01:07:34.911 --> 01:07:36.212
...than the potion.

1434
01:07:36.245 --> 01:07:37.314
That's what I said.

1435
01:07:37.347 --> 01:07:40.216
Sire! News from
the mushrooms!


1436
01:07:40.249 --> 01:07:42.619
An arm skis on roaches.

1437
01:07:45.888 --> 01:07:46.923
Carry on!

1438
01:07:46.956 --> 01:07:48.058
How'd you do?

1439
01:07:48.091 --> 01:07:49.659
I nailed it!

1440
01:07:49.692 --> 01:07:50.927
Something more power...

1441
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.295
I'm bored!
I'll just tell you.


1442
01:07:52.328 --> 01:07:53.597
Great!

1443
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:54.831
If you set me free.

1444
01:07:54.864 --> 01:07:55.999
No!

1445
01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:58.702
Okay.

1446
01:07:58.735 --> 01:08:00.170
Yeah!

1447
01:08:00.203 --> 01:08:04.007
Then I will reveal
the antidote with a story.


1448
01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.642
What? No!

1449
01:08:05.675 --> 01:08:07.611
One fateful day,

1450
01:08:07.644 --> 01:08:09.012
when the Bog King
was young and impetuous,


1451
01:08:11.347 --> 01:08:14.284
he fell in love with
a sweet young thing.


1452
01:08:14.317 --> 01:08:16.186
Ew!

1453
01:08:16.219 --> 01:08:19.956
She was the most
beautiful creature
I ever saw.


1454
01:08:19.989 --> 01:08:21.024
Seriously?

1455
01:08:21.057 --> 01:08:22.258
Hmm.

1456
01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:24.694
He was so in love.

1457
01:08:24.727 --> 01:08:26.730
But Bog, he had no patience.

1458
01:08:26.763 --> 01:08:28.264
That's enough!

1459
01:08:28.297 --> 01:08:30.900
So, he came to me
for my love potion.


1460
01:08:30.933 --> 01:08:33.236
I tried to tell him
how it worked.


1461
01:08:35.004 --> 01:08:37.907
But he dusted the sweet,
unsuspecting creature.


1462
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:40.043
Plum, I beg you.

1463
01:08:40.076 --> 01:08:43.880
As she was gazing into
the eyes of a lovesick Bog...


1464
01:08:51.821 --> 01:08:53.023
Even with a love potion,

1465
01:08:55.758 --> 01:08:57.628
I'm too hideous to love.

1466
01:08:58.795 --> 01:09:00.230
You're not hideous.

1467
01:09:02.365 --> 01:09:04.267
Hideous,
not hideous, whatever!


1468
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.670
But that's not why
the potion didn't work.


1469
01:09:07.336 --> 01:09:08.905
What?

1470
01:09:08.938 --> 01:09:13.209
She was already in love
with someone else!


1471
01:09:13.242 --> 01:09:16.179
So, the one thing
more powerful
than the potion


1472
01:09:16.212 --> 01:09:17.947
is real love?

1473
01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.849
Bingo!

1474
01:09:19.982 --> 01:09:21.017
That took forever!

1475
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:22.819
Why didn't you tell me?

1476
01:09:22.852 --> 01:09:25.989
You shut me away,
and you shut me up!


1477
01:09:26.022 --> 01:09:27.957
And Griselda
blames me for the


1478
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:30.326
no-love-in-the
-Dark
-Forest!

1479
01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:31.895
Teaching moment.

1480
01:09:31.928 --> 01:09:33.664
There are
no shortcuts to love.


1481
01:09:35.264 --> 01:09:37.267
Just saying.

1482
01:09:35.264 --> 01:09:37.267
Stuff, take it away.

1483
01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.436
Okay, B.K. Here.

1484
01:09:39.469 --> 01:09:41.037
Wait, wait, wait!

1485
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.804
Wait a minute!

1486
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.309
This antidote
won't help Dawn.


1487
01:09:46.342 --> 01:09:47.744
She's never been

1488
01:09:47.777 --> 01:09:50.447
in love with anybody.

1489
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.317
I shouldn't have
used the potion
on that poor, sweet...


1490
01:09:55.451 --> 01:09:57.287
Nothing would have been...

1491
01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.221
Real.

1492
01:09:59.522 --> 01:10:01.725
Well...

1493
01:10:01.758 --> 01:10:05.395
I know all about
getting your heart broken.


1494
01:10:05.428 --> 01:10:08.364
I almost married someone
who didn't love me.


1495
01:10:08.397 --> 01:10:09.799
Why?

1496
01:10:09.832 --> 01:10:11.067
He was so good-looking.

1497
01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.736
Oh.

1498
01:10:12.769 --> 01:10:15.905
Maybe I couldn't
bear to see


1499
01:10:15.938 --> 01:10:19.909
that he really was
a shallow, power-hungry,


1500
01:10:19.942 --> 01:10:22.746
cheating, chattering,
pig son of a...


1501
01:10:22.779 --> 01:10:23.246
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1502
01:10:25.481 --> 01:10:30.019
Inside, I knew he
didn't want me to be...


1503
01:10:30.052 --> 01:10:31.088
You?

1504
01:10:31.988 --> 01:10:33.123
Yeah.

1505
01:10:33.156 --> 01:10:34.324
But you are

1506
01:10:35.958 --> 01:10:37.093
different.

1507
01:10:37.126 --> 01:10:38.862
I've been told.

1508
01:10:38.895 --> 01:10:40.196
That's what I like!

1509
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:42.031
I mean, uh...

1510
01:10:42.064 --> 01:10:42.999
Well, you know.

1511
01:10:44.467 --> 01:10:48.805
So, now I keep
my guard up.


1512
01:10:44.467 --> 01:10:48.805
Me, too.

1513
01:10:48.838 --> 01:10:52.375
And most important,
I never...


1514
01:10:52.408 --> 01:10:53.877
Trust anybody!

1515
01:11:00.449 --> 01:11:02.152
Come on.

1516
01:11:02.185 --> 01:11:03.987
Let's go
stretch our wings.


1517
01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.388
Good idea! Good idea. Yes.

1518
01:11:07.557 --> 01:11:09.092
Here.

1519
01:11:09.125 --> 01:11:10.894
Thank you.

1520
01:11:28.511 --> 01:11:31.381
Hmm, maybe you should
rethink this entrance.


1521
01:11:32.949 --> 01:11:36.953
Try thinking of this
as an adventure!


1522
01:11:38.955 --> 01:11:39.890
Nice goblin.

1523
01:11:46.462 --> 01:11:48.364
Hey, how about we go back?

1524
01:11:48.397 --> 01:11:49.899
Why?

1525
01:11:49.932 --> 01:11:52.202
The moonlight
is perfect right now.


1526
01:12:00.576 --> 01:12:01.812
Come on,

1527
01:12:03.012 --> 01:12:03.847
"tough girl."

1528
01:12:04.647 --> 01:12:05.415
Uh...

1529
01:12:22.999 --> 01:12:26.603
- You're waking meadows

1530
01:12:26.636 --> 01:12:30.106
- In my mind

1531
01:12:30.139 --> 01:12:33.476
- Making waves
across my time


1532
01:12:35.177 --> 01:12:38.048
- Oh, no
Oh, no


1533
01:12:40.216 --> 01:12:45.288
- I got a strange magic

1534
01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:50.493
- Oh, what a strange magic

1535
01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:50.493
- Strange magic

1536
01:12:50.526 --> 01:12:54.597
- Oh, it's a strange magic

1537
01:12:50.526 --> 01:12:54.597
- Strange magic

1538
01:12:56.198 --> 01:13:00.403
- Got a strange magic

1539
01:13:05.174 --> 01:13:09.545
- You're sailing
softly through the sun


1540
01:13:09.578 --> 01:13:12.415
- Softly through the sun

1541
01:13:12.448 --> 01:13:16.920
- Of a land I've always known

1542
01:13:16.953 --> 01:13:18.254
- You fly

1543
01:13:18.287 --> 01:13:19.489
- You fly

1544
01:13:19.522 --> 01:13:20.657
- So high

1545
01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:22.358
- So high

1546
01:13:22.391 --> 01:13:26.696
- I get a strange magic

1547
01:13:22.391 --> 01:13:26.696
- Strange magic

1548
01:13:26.729 --> 01:13:30.400
- Oh, what a strange magic

1549
01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:36.339
- Oh, it's a strange magic

1550
01:13:38.007 --> 01:13:42.279
- Got a strange magic

1551
01:13:45.381 --> 01:13:46.983
- Oh, I

1552
01:13:47.016 --> 01:13:47.651
- Oh, I

1553
01:13:49.151 --> 01:13:50.553
- Never gonna be

1554
01:13:50.586 --> 01:13:52.522
- Never gonna
be the same again


1555
01:13:52.555 --> 01:13:54.457
- Never gonna
be the same again


1556
01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:57.460
- Now I've seen
the way it's got to end


1557
01:13:57.493 --> 01:13:58.594
- Got to end

1558
01:13:58.627 --> 01:14:00.129
- Sweet dreams

1559
01:14:00.162 --> 01:14:01.064
- Sweet dreams

1560
01:14:01.097 --> 01:14:02.332
- Sweet dreams

1561
01:14:02.365 --> 01:14:04.000
- Sweet dreams

1562
01:14:04.033 --> 01:14:07.103
- Got a strange magic

1563
01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:13.977
- Oh, what a strange magic

1564
01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:18.381
- Oh, it's a strange magic

1565
01:14:19.582 --> 01:14:24.687
- Got a strange magic

1566
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.291
- Got a strange magic

1567
01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.627
- It's magic

1568
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.729
- It's magic

1569
01:14:32.762 --> 01:14:34.697
- It's magic

1570
01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:35.698
It's magic.

1571
01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:36.700
- It's magic

1572
01:14:37.533 --> 01:14:38.534
- It's magic -

1573
01:14:38.567 --> 01:14:40.003
It's...

1574
01:14:43.572 --> 01:14:45.241
Oh...

1575
01:14:49.779 --> 01:14:51.614
You...

1576
01:14:51.647 --> 01:14:54.317
You played me!

1577
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:55.785
"Played you"?
I don't under...


1578
01:14:55.818 --> 01:14:56.753
Oh, no.

1579
01:14:57.586 --> 01:14:59.255
Oh, no, no, no.

1580
01:15:00.423 --> 01:15:02.392
Halt!

1581
01:15:02.425 --> 01:15:05.228
Disgusting creatures,
I come in peace.


1582
01:15:06.328 --> 01:15:08.364
I must get this
love potion


1583
01:15:08.397 --> 01:15:10.733
to your Bog King

1584
01:15:10.766 --> 01:15:12.735
by moondown.

1585
01:15:12.768 --> 01:15:16.639
I will need only three men.
My army will wait here.


1586
01:15:16.672 --> 01:15:18.074
Sandy.

1587
01:15:16.672 --> 01:15:18.074
It's Sunny.

1588
01:15:18.107 --> 01:15:18.808
You're in charge.

1589
01:15:18.107 --> 01:15:18.808
Me?

1590
01:15:18.841 --> 01:15:20.043
Look fierce.

1591
01:15:20.076 --> 01:15:21.277
Uh...

1592
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:22.345
Fiercer!

1593
01:15:27.483 --> 01:15:28.818
Wait!

1594
01:15:28.851 --> 01:15:30.353
I won't be a fool again!

1595
01:15:30.386 --> 01:15:31.621
I didn't know!

1596
01:15:31.654 --> 01:15:33.222
I wouldn't follow me

1597
01:15:33.255 --> 01:15:34.324
if I were you, Princess.

1598
01:15:35.658 --> 01:15:38.194
You won't want to
see what I do to them.


1599
01:15:39.662 --> 01:15:41.731
I won't let that happen.

1600
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.268
Ugh!

1601
01:15:45.301 --> 01:15:47.070
I am so stupid!

1602
01:15:51.407 --> 01:15:54.277
Execute plan on
my code word, "Go."


1603
01:15:57.413 --> 01:16:01.551
What kind of
odious throne is this?


1604
01:16:01.584 --> 01:16:03.386
Do something!

1605
01:16:01.584 --> 01:16:03.386
Uh...

1606
01:16:04.854 --> 01:16:06.289
Hold it, whoa, whoa,
hold it, hold it.


1607
01:16:06.322 --> 01:16:09.292
I'm here to give you this.

1608
01:16:09.325 --> 01:16:11.561
That is,
once you've given me...


1609
01:16:11.594 --> 01:16:13.696
Get the princess.

1610
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:16.699
You mean
the princess-es...


1611
01:16:16.732 --> 01:16:18.301
Roland! What are you...

1612
01:16:18.334 --> 01:16:19.469
Restrain her!

1613
01:16:18.334 --> 01:16:19.469
No!

1614
01:16:19.502 --> 01:16:21.237
Oh! Hey!

1615
01:16:22.671 --> 01:16:23.506
He brought you
the potion!


1616
01:16:23.539 --> 01:16:25.508
Yes. And an army!

1617
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:27.210
Well...

1618
01:16:27.243 --> 01:16:29.812
You got me to
leave my castle.
Clever girl.


1619
01:16:29.845 --> 01:16:31.814
But wasn't that your idea?

1620
01:16:31.847 --> 01:16:33.850
It was your idea!

1621
01:16:33.883 --> 01:16:35.885
And foolishly, 
I trusted you.

1622
01:16:35.918 --> 01:16:38.321
Wait a minute. Are you...

1623
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:43.759
Are you actually
having a lovers' tiff
right now?


1624
01:16:43.792 --> 01:16:46.429
That is so disgusting!
It's interesting
but disgust...


1625
01:16:46.462 --> 01:16:48.431
Roland, you are such a...

1626
01:16:48.464 --> 01:16:51.234
Hero, to rescue you from...
What did you call him?


1627
01:16:51.267 --> 01:16:53.870
A scaly-backed cockroach.

1628
01:16:55.771 --> 01:16:57.406
Is that the guy?

1629
01:16:57.439 --> 01:16:58.341
Ugh.

1630
01:17:01.911 --> 01:17:03.913
Hey, Pare, I can't
stand it anymore.


1631
01:17:03.946 --> 01:17:05.315
I have to go find her.
You're in charge.


1632
01:17:08.851 --> 01:17:10.453
Uh...

1633
01:17:10.486 --> 01:17:11.888
What's going on?

1634
01:17:11.921 --> 01:17:13.589
Whoa!

1635
01:17:13.622 --> 01:17:15.892
Dawn! Are you down here?

1636
01:17:15.925 --> 01:17:17.693
- Hey, Sunny!
- You didn't listen!


1637
01:17:17.726 --> 01:17:20.163
What? Oh!

1638
01:17:20.196 --> 01:17:22.165
I said, "Stand in front!
Be the first she sees
when she..."


1639
01:17:22.198 --> 01:17:23.799
Please tell me
where Dawn is.


1640
01:17:23.832 --> 01:17:26.335
Okay, okay, I'll show you,

1641
01:17:26.368 --> 01:17:29.772
if you let us all out.

1642
01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.743
Which would be so sweet,
since this is all your fault!


1643
01:17:34.577 --> 01:17:35.345
Okay.

1644
01:17:38.781 --> 01:17:40.583
Yay!

1645
01:17:40.616 --> 01:17:42.685
My Boggy-woggy
Kingy-wingy.


1646
01:17:42.718 --> 01:17:45.254
Oh... I wish
I didn't see that.


1647
01:17:45.287 --> 01:17:45.855
This isn't...

1648
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:49.292
I didn't mean for

1649
01:17:50.526 --> 01:17:53.263
any of this to happen.

1650
01:17:54.496 --> 01:17:56.399
Of course, uh,

1651
01:17:56.432 --> 01:17:58.568
I will be taking
both princesses.


1652
01:17:58.601 --> 01:17:59.969
That wasn't the deal.

1653
01:18:02.404 --> 01:18:04.174
No!

1654
01:18:11.513 --> 01:18:12.715
Deal's off.

1655
01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.291
Ugh. I wanted a wedding,
now I'm getting a funeral.


1656
01:18:26.495 --> 01:18:27.863
You leave my Boggy alone!

1657
01:18:27.896 --> 01:18:29.665
Hey! Oh!

1658
01:18:27.896 --> 01:18:29.665
"Bog."

1659
01:18:29.698 --> 01:18:31.834
What were you thinking?
A beast like you


1660
01:18:31.867 --> 01:18:34.904
falling for a beauty
like Marianne.


1661
01:18:37.573 --> 01:18:38.908
Who's the beast?

1662
01:18:40.342 --> 01:18:41.944
Stay out of it!

1663
01:18:41.977 --> 01:18:43.646
Hey! I can take
care of myself!


1664
01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:45.514
Two against one?

1665
01:18:45.547 --> 01:18:46.649
Not fair.

1666
01:18:46.682 --> 01:18:48.618
Roland! What are you...

1667
01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.256
Ah...

1668
01:18:53.289 --> 01:18:54.724
Let her go!

1669
01:18:54.757 --> 01:18:56.326
You're forcing me
to change my plan.


1670
01:18:57.493 --> 01:18:58.928
So,

1671
01:18:58.961 --> 01:19:02.031
sadly, now's the time
for me to


1672
01:19:02.064 --> 01:19:02.865
go!

1673
01:19:07.836 --> 01:19:08.838
Come on! We gotta hurry!

1674
01:19:08.871 --> 01:19:09.639
Oh, no.

1675
01:19:13.042 --> 01:19:15.011
Boy, oh boy, oh boy!

1676
01:19:17.613 --> 01:19:19.315
Keep it moving!

1677
01:19:19.348 --> 01:19:20.516
Especially you, Turtle!

1678
01:19:32.528 --> 01:19:33.997
What is happening?

1679
01:19:45.874 --> 01:19:46.442
No!

1680
01:19:45.874 --> 01:19:46.442
Marianne!

1681
01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:56.352
I have to find
your sister.


1682
01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:56.352
Okay.

1683
01:19:56.385 --> 01:19:58.087
And my mother.

1684
01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.623
My life is flashing
before my eyes.


1685
01:20:00.656 --> 01:20:02.792
Hey, I used to be hot.

1686
01:20:02.825 --> 01:20:04.093
You?

1687
01:20:04.126 --> 01:20:05.394
No time for chitchat.

1688
01:20:11.934 --> 01:20:12.735
Dawn!

1689
01:20:13.802 --> 01:20:14.403
Dawn!

1690
01:20:17.072 --> 01:20:17.740
Let go!

1691
01:20:18.841 --> 01:20:20.109
Sweetheart!

1692
01:20:20.142 --> 01:20:21.444
I'm gonna skewer your...

1693
01:20:21.477 --> 01:20:24.480
You will marry me!

1694
01:20:43.766 --> 01:20:45.368
Marianne!

1695
01:20:45.401 --> 01:20:46.636
Marianne!

1696
01:20:47.903 --> 01:20:49.138
We have to go.

1697
01:20:55.177 --> 01:20:57.380
Dawn! I'm coming!

1698
01:20:57.413 --> 01:20:58.481
Marianne! Get back!

1699
01:21:07.823 --> 01:21:09.091
Go!

1700
01:21:09.124 --> 01:21:10.659
Wait! Wait!

1701
01:21:16.832 --> 01:21:17.967
Bog!

1702
01:21:37.553 --> 01:21:38.788
My son.

1703
01:21:43.559 --> 01:21:44.794
Dawn!

1704
01:21:44.827 --> 01:21:45.628
Dawn!

1705
01:21:46.895 --> 01:21:47.764
You're all right.

1706
01:21:48.864 --> 01:21:50.099
You're really all right.

1707
01:21:50.132 --> 01:21:51.467
You're all right.

1708
01:21:56.071 --> 01:21:59.776
- Don't worry
About a thing


1709
01:22:01.777 --> 01:22:03.946
- 'Cause every little thing

1710
01:22:03.979 --> 01:22:06.715
- Gonna be all right

1711
01:22:06.748 --> 01:22:09.819
- Don't worry
About a thing -


1712
01:22:09.852 --> 01:22:11.654
Sunny?

1713
01:22:11.687 --> 01:22:13.088
- 'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be... -


1714
01:22:13.121 --> 01:22:15.024
Sunny.

1715
01:22:15.057 --> 01:22:16.125
I love you.

1716
01:22:18.627 --> 01:22:19.495
Me?

1717
01:22:20.562 --> 01:22:21.531
You.

1718
01:22:23.632 --> 01:22:25.234
Mmm.

1719
01:22:36.011 --> 01:22:37.146
Are you

1720
01:22:38.514 --> 01:22:39.115
back?

1721
01:22:40.048 --> 01:22:42.184
Yeah.

1722
01:22:42.217 --> 01:22:44.921
But I don't know how.

1723
01:22:51.827 --> 01:22:52.962
I know.

1724
01:23:04.206 --> 01:23:05.675
I'm sorry.

1725
01:23:11.747 --> 01:23:13.115
Yahoo!

1726
01:23:11.747 --> 01:23:13.115
He's alive!

1727
01:23:25.227 --> 01:23:26.062
Bog!

1728
01:23:32.067 --> 01:23:33.869
My precious boy!

1729
01:23:33.902 --> 01:23:35.638
Ow!

1730
01:23:35.671 --> 01:23:38.541
Out of the way.
Move! Move!


1731
01:23:38.574 --> 01:23:39.942
King coming through.

1732
01:23:41.643 --> 01:23:41.944
Whoo-hoo!

1733
01:23:44.813 --> 01:23:46.949
No!

1734
01:23:44.813 --> 01:23:46.949
Marianne!

1735
01:23:46.982 --> 01:23:48.183
No! No, no, no!

1736
01:23:48.216 --> 01:23:50.586
Patience.

1737
01:23:50.619 --> 01:23:52.154
Ugh!

1738
01:23:53.622 --> 01:23:54.624
Here we go.

1739
01:23:56.091 --> 01:23:59.662
- Sugar pie, honey bunch

1740
01:23:59.695 --> 01:24:01.730
What?

1741
01:23:59.695 --> 01:24:01.730
Marianne?

1742
01:24:01.763 --> 01:24:04.934
- You know that I love you

1743
01:24:04.967 --> 01:24:06.735
That's what I wanna hear.

1744
01:24:06.768 --> 01:24:10.739
- I can't help myself

1745
01:24:10.772 --> 01:24:11.974
Of course not,
babycakes.


1746
01:24:12.007 --> 01:24:14.577
- I love... -

1747
01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:16.145
Whoa!

1748
01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:24.787
Ooh! It didn't work.

1749
01:24:25.821 --> 01:24:27.823
I wonder why.

1750
01:24:27.856 --> 01:24:28.757
Gosh, is that great!

1751
01:24:29.925 --> 01:24:31.760
I like that smell.

1752
01:24:31.793 --> 01:24:33.729
Aftershave?

1753
01:24:31.793 --> 01:24:33.729
No.

1754
01:24:33.762 --> 01:24:35.831
Is that cologne?

1755
01:24:33.762 --> 01:24:35.831
No.

1756
01:24:35.864 --> 01:24:38.767
Well, boys, I've learned
a valuable lesson.


1757
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.236
Never judge something
or someone


1758
01:24:41.269 --> 01:24:43.639
by how it or he or she

1759
01:24:44.139 --> 01:24:46.041
looks.

1760
01:24:46.074 --> 01:24:47.677
An elf!

1761
01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:53.716
Wait. Body lotion?

1762
01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:53.716
No.

1763
01:24:53.749 --> 01:24:54.817
Cold cream?

1764
01:24:53.749 --> 01:24:54.817
No.

1765
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:57.620
Ah! Got it! Deodorant.

1766
01:24:57.653 --> 01:24:58.721
It's perfume.

1767
01:24:58.754 --> 01:25:01.156
Nah. Are you a girl?

1768
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:03.025
Isn't it obvious?

1769
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:03.025
Huh?

1770
01:25:04.026 --> 01:25:06.128
It's kind of subtle.

1771
01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:08.697
Are you okay?

1772
01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:10.366
I'm fine. Um...

1773
01:25:10.399 --> 01:25:13.969
Wings, shoulders, head,
all good.


1774
01:25:14.002 --> 01:25:16.305
You?

1775
01:25:14.002 --> 01:25:16.305
I'm good, too.

1776
01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.009
I just wanted to say,

1777
01:25:22.878 --> 01:25:25.915
I'll never see this place
the same way ever again.


1778
01:25:26.715 --> 01:25:27.650
Yeah.

1779
01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:29.785
Here.

1780
01:25:29.818 --> 01:25:31.320
It's hideous, but...

1781
01:25:32.387 --> 01:25:33.255
Yeah.

1782
01:25:34.089 --> 01:25:35.858
Then, um...

1783
01:25:35.891 --> 01:25:37.926
Bye!

1784
01:25:37.959 --> 01:25:39.695
Whoa!

1785
01:25:39.728 --> 01:25:41.730
I didn't mean
to sound so cute.


1786
01:25:41.763 --> 01:25:45.267
Cute actually works for you.

1787
01:25:47.769 --> 01:25:50.205
You know...

1788
01:25:47.769 --> 01:25:50.205
Yes?

1789
01:25:50.238 --> 01:25:52.642
Feel free to visit
whenever you like.


1790
01:25:53.241 --> 01:25:55.244
Oh. Okay.

1791
01:25:55.277 --> 01:25:57.012
Please don't sing!

1792
01:25:57.045 --> 01:25:58.814
You know what, Bog?

1793
01:25:57.045 --> 01:25:58.814
"Boggy."

1794
01:25:58.847 --> 01:26:00.916
It's never going
to work between us.


1795
01:26:00.949 --> 01:26:03.719
Well...

1796
01:26:00.949 --> 01:26:03.719
Shh! It's not you,
it's me.


1797
01:26:03.752 --> 01:26:05.721
No problem.

1798
01:26:03.752 --> 01:26:05.721
Yeah. No problem at all.

1799
01:26:05.754 --> 01:26:08.390
Marianne, a word.

1800
01:26:08.423 --> 01:26:11.994
I smell romance.

1801
01:26:12.027 --> 01:26:15.364
I hate that you always
hover and watch and worry!


1802
01:26:15.397 --> 01:26:17.099
I'm sorry?

1803
01:26:17.132 --> 01:26:20.369
But I love that you
came to this forest


1804
01:26:22.104 --> 01:26:24.140
to save me.

1805
01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.776
So, now,
I get to lecture you.


1806
01:26:27.809 --> 01:26:30.012
Huh?

1807
01:26:30.045 --> 01:26:34.149
- I know
something about love


1808
01:26:34.182 --> 01:26:37.486
- You've gotta want it bad

1809
01:26:37.519 --> 01:26:41.356
- If that guy's
got into your blood


1810
01:26:41.389 --> 01:26:43.392
- Go out and get him

1811
01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.896
- If you want him to be

1812
01:26:47.929 --> 01:26:51.867
- The very part of you

1813
01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.471
- That makes you
wanna breathe


1814
01:26:55.504 --> 01:26:59.341
- Here's the thing to do

1815
01:26:59.374 --> 01:27:01.910
- Tell him that
you're never gonna leave him


1816
01:27:01.943 --> 01:27:03.111
Tell him.

1817
01:27:03.144 --> 01:27:06.248
- Tell him that
you're always gonna love him


1818
01:27:06.281 --> 01:27:07.950
- Tell him

1819
01:27:06.281 --> 01:27:07.950
- Tell him!

1820
01:27:07.983 --> 01:27:09.351
- Tell him!

1821
01:27:09.384 --> 01:27:11.153
My dear,
we need to have a talk.


1822
01:27:11.186 --> 01:27:12.955
Tell her how you feel.

1823
01:27:14.356 --> 01:27:18.160
- Tell her right now

1824
01:27:21.396 --> 01:27:24.833
- We know
something about love


1825
01:27:24.866 --> 01:27:27.436
- You've gotta show it and

1826
01:27:27.469 --> 01:27:30.072
- Make him see
the moon up above


1827
01:27:30.105 --> 01:27:32.040
- Reach out and get it

1828
01:27:32.073 --> 01:27:34.843
- If you want him to

1829
01:27:34.876 --> 01:27:37.279
- Make your heart sing out

1830
01:27:37.312 --> 01:27:39.481
- If you want her to

1831
01:27:39.514 --> 01:27:42.151
- Only think of you

1832
01:27:42.184 --> 01:27:44.887
- Tell him that
you're never gonna leave him


1833
01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.222
- Tell him that
you're always gonna love him


1834
01:27:47.255 --> 01:27:48.957
- Tell him, tell him
Tell him


1835
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:51.059
- Tell him right now

1836
01:27:51.092 --> 01:27:52.861
- Tell her right now

1837
01:27:52.894 --> 01:27:55.330
- Tell him that
you're never gonna leave him


1838
01:27:55.363 --> 01:27:57.299
- Tell her that
you're always gonna love her


1839
01:27:57.332 --> 01:27:58.300
- Tell her, tell her

1840
01:27:58.333 --> 01:28:00.035
- Tell her

1841
01:28:00.068 --> 01:28:02.871
Not that I'm nagging,
but...


1842
01:28:02.904 --> 01:28:07.009
- Tell her right now

1843
01:28:02.904 --> 01:28:07.009
- Tell him right now

1844
01:28:09.477 --> 01:28:12.181
Well, um, I...

1845
01:28:12.214 --> 01:28:17.820
- Right now -

1846
01:28:20.222 --> 01:28:21.490
Now!

1847
01:28:21.523 --> 01:28:23.192
Okay, okay.

1848
01:28:23.225 --> 01:28:25.194
Deep, deep

1849
01:28:25.227 --> 01:28:28.096
relaxing breaths.

1850
01:28:29.497 --> 01:28:34.303
- Wise men say

1851
01:28:34.336 --> 01:28:38.073
- Only fools rush in

1852
01:28:40.008 --> 01:28:42.812
- But I can't help

1853
01:28:43.345 --> 01:28:45.547
- Falling in...

1854
01:28:47.282 --> 01:28:51.620
- Falling in love with... -

1855
01:28:53.088 --> 01:28:55.991
Maybe I should
take it from here.


1856
01:29:02.931 --> 01:29:07.202
- Wild thing

1857
01:29:07.235 --> 01:29:08.937
- You make my heart sing

1858
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:09.905
Oh!

1859
01:29:11.573 --> 01:29:13.409
- You make everything

1860
01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:20.015
- Groovy

1861
01:29:20.949 --> 01:29:24.086
- Oh, wild thing

1862
01:29:25.287 --> 01:29:27.556
- You make my heart sing

1863
01:29:27.589 --> 01:29:30.125

01:29:33.561 --> 01:29:38.367
- Groovy

1866
01:29:41.336 --> 01:29:45.274
- Wild thing,
I think I love you!


1867
01:29:45.307 --> 01:29:49.511
- But I wanna know for sure

1868
01:29:49.544 --> 01:29:52.348
- Come on, hold me tight

1869
01:29:54.716 --> 01:29:57.586
- I love you

1870
01:30:05.126 --> 01:30:05.995
Uh-oh!

1871
01:30:10.398 --> 01:30:12.601
- You make me want to sing

1872
01:30:12.634 --> 01:30:15.637
- You make my heart

1873
01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:19.207
- You sing my song
You make my heart


1874
01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:24.146
- You make my
You make my


1875

1876
01:30:40.662 --> 01:30:43.432
- Love

1877
01:30:43.465 --> 01:30:47.069
- Love is strange

1878
01:30:47.102 --> 01:30:50.973
- A lot of people

1879
01:30:51.006 --> 01:30:53.575
- Take it for a game

1880
01:30:55.143 --> 01:30:57.646
- Once you get it

1881
01:30:58.613 --> 01:31:01.216
- You're in an awful fix

1882
01:31:02.517 --> 01:31:05.254
- 'Cause after you've had it

1883
01:31:06.421 --> 01:31:08.691
- You never wanna quit

1884
01:31:12.327 --> 01:31:18.367
- Love is strange

1885
01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:24.139
- Love

1886
01:31:26.174 --> 01:31:29.378
- Is strange

1887
01:31:29.411 --> 01:31:33.448
- Oh, many people

1888
01:31:33.481 --> 01:31:36.218
- They don't understand

1889
01:31:37.385 --> 01:31:41.223
- They think loving

1890
01:31:41.256 --> 01:31:44.059
- Is money in the hand

1891
01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:49.231
- 'Cause sweet loving, hmm

1892
01:31:49.264 --> 01:31:51.500
- Is better than a kiss

1893
01:31:53.068 --> 01:31:56.538
- And when you leave

1894
01:31:56.571 --> 01:31:59.441
- Those kisses you will miss

1895
01:32:01.676 --> 01:32:07.483
- Love is strange

1896
01:32:09.784 --> 01:32:15.190
- Love

1897
01:32:16.658 --> 01:32:22.197
- Is strange

1898
01:32:29.537 --> 01:32:31.407
- Uh-uh -

1899
01:32:35.477 --> 01:32:38.080
It's far-out.

1900
01:32:38.113 --> 01:32:39.548
It's groovy.

1901
01:32:41.349 --> 01:32:43.385
Ah, it's so happening.

1902
01:32:44.285 --> 01:32:45.754
It's a weird trip, man.

1903
01:32:47.889 --> 01:32:48.723
Roland?

1904
01:32:48.756 --> 01:32:49.758
Roland!

1905
01:32:55.563 --> 01:32:57.365
Ignore them, sweetie.

1906
01:32:57.398 --> 01:32:59.601
Beauty is in
the eye of the beholder.


1907
01:33:02.804 --> 01:33:03.806
Oh, I think I got
one of your antennae.


1908
01:33:15.316 --> 01:33:16.618
- Don't worry

1909
01:33:17.352 --> 01:33:19.221
- About a thing

1910
01:33:19.254 --> 01:33:20.889
Hmm.

1911
01:33:20.922 --> 01:33:25.360
- 'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right


1912
01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:27.229

All right.

01:33:36.271 --> 01:33:38.640
- Woke up this morning

1919
01:33:38.673 --> 01:33:41.176
- Smiled at the rising sun

1920
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:43.478
- Three little birds

1921
01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:46.248
- Pitch by my doorstep

1922
01:33:46.281 --> 01:33:48.917

Huh?

1979
01:39:04.031 --> 01:39:05.634
Nailed it again.
