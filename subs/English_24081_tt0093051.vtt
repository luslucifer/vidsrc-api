00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:09.437
WHAT WAS THAT?

157
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.178
THAT WAS A TENANT.
HE WON'T VACATE.


158
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.616
MY GOD. YOU
HAVEN'T HAD HIM
GUILLOTINED YET?


159
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.139
[LAUGHTER]

160
00:09:16.183 --> 00:09:18.881
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I GUESS I WAS A LITTLE
BIT OVERZEALOUS.


161
00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:19.752
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

162
00:09:19.795 --> 00:09:21.536
NOT AT ALL.
WE ENJOYED IT--


163
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.626
PARTICULARLY
THE PART ABOUT
ZORRO'S HATBAND.


164
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.543
THAT'S A VERY
ORIGINAL TERM
IN JURISPRUDENCE.


165
00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:31.372
IT'S NEGOTIATION
AS ART FORM.


166
00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:32.373
I'M VERY SORRY.

167
00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:34.288
IT WAS VERY
INDUSTRIOUS.


168
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:36.507
ALL RIGHT,
CAKE FOR EVERYONE,


169
00:09:36.551 --> 00:09:38.161
AND NOSES BACK
IN YOUR BRIEFS.


170
00:09:38.205 --> 00:09:39.467
YOU'LL FORGIVE
THE EXPRESSION.


171
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.557
AND THANK YOU ALL
VERY MUCH.


172
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.906
SIR.

173
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.125
Man: ALL RIGHT,
WHO'S THE HUNGRIEST
PERSON HERE?


174
00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.605
Different man: CINDY.
SHE CARRIED THE CAKE.


175
00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:48.476
YOU SLICK SON OF A BITCH.

176
00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:49.477
ZORRO'S HATBAND?

177
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.870
IT JUST CAME TO ME.

178
00:09:50.913 --> 00:09:52.523
ROBERTA'S NOSTRILS
ACTUALLY FLARED.
I SWEAR TO GOD.


179
00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:54.743
DESPERATION
IS MY MIDDLE NAME.


180
00:09:54.787 --> 00:09:56.223
Man: WEATHERS!

181
00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:57.703
COME ON.

182
00:09:58.573 --> 00:09:59.661
WEATHERS, DAMN IT!

183
00:09:59.705 --> 00:10:00.793
YOU WANT ME?

184
00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:01.489
THE TORKENSON TRIAL
IS ON FOR TOMORROW.


185
00:10:01.532 --> 00:10:02.359
WHY WASN'T I NOTIFIED?

186
00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:03.317
I SENT YOU A MEMO
LAST WEEK.


187
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.318
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
I NEVER GOT IT.


188
00:10:04.361 --> 00:10:05.624
SIR, DID YOU CHECK
YOUR BOX?


189
00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:06.712
OF COURSE I CHECKED
MY BOX.


190
00:10:06.755 --> 00:10:08.017
YOU DIDN'T SEND IT
TO ME, THAT'S WHAT.


191
00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:08.844
SIR, I DID.

192
00:10:08.888 --> 00:10:10.411
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

193
00:10:10.454 --> 00:10:11.455
ALL RIGHT, FIND IT.

194
00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:12.848
I KNOW I SENT IT.
IT HAS TO BE HERE.


195
00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:13.806
YOU NEVER SENT IT.

196
00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:15.111
WHAT ABOUT THESE FILES
OVER HERE?


197
00:10:15.155 --> 00:10:16.635
KEEP YOUR NOSE
OUT OF THAT.
THAT'S ANOTHER CASE.


198
00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:18.027
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THAT 50 TIMES.


199
00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:19.202
MAYBE IT'S ALL
MIXED UP ON THAT STUFF
ON YOUR DESK.


200
00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:20.377
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S MIXED UP.


201
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:23.250
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ADMIT YOU NEVER SENT IT?


202
00:10:23.293 --> 00:10:25.426
WHAT'S THIS?

203
00:10:25.469 --> 00:10:30.126
HERE IT IS. SEE?
DATED JUNE 12--LAST WEEK.


204
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.998
HOW DID THAT
GET DOWN THERE?


205
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:34.565
TRIAL JUNE 19.

206
00:10:36.698 --> 00:10:39.788
NO CONTINUANCE.
WE'RE SCREWED,
TOTALLY SCREWED.


207
00:10:39.832 --> 00:10:41.007
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

208
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.486
THE TORKENSON TRIAL
IS ON FOR TOMORROW.


209
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.532
THERE'S NO CONTINUANCE,
AND I'VE NEVER
SEEN THE FILES.


210
00:10:44.575 --> 00:10:46.055
I CAN TRY IT.WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

211
00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:47.753
YOU CAN TRY IT?

212
00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:49.668
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

213
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:53.062
OUR CLIENT PUNCHED SOMEONE,
AND HE'S BEING SUED


214
00:10:53.106 --> 00:10:53.976
FOR $50,000.

215
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.456
I KNOW THE CASE.
I CAN TRY IT.


216
00:10:55.499 --> 00:10:57.719
IT'S A PIMPLE.
LET HIM TRY IT.


217
00:10:57.763 --> 00:10:59.199
WHAT CHOICE
DO WE HAVE?


218
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.723
OUR CLIENT IS
THE PRESIDENT OF A BANK.


219
00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:02.724
I CAN DO IT.

220
00:11:02.768 --> 00:11:03.638
HE CAN DO IT.

221
00:11:03.682 --> 00:11:06.423
PHIL, BE SERIOUS.
HE'S A KID.


222
00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.469
GO WITH HIM
AND HOLD HIS HAND.


223
00:11:08.512 --> 00:11:09.731
YOU CAN DO IT.

224
00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:10.732
YES, SIR.

225
00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:11.733
GOOD BOY.

226
00:11:11.777 --> 00:11:12.603
GOOD GOD.

227
00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:14.518
THANK YOU, SIR.

228
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.478
GOOD LUCK.

229
00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:24.659
HA HA HAH!

230
00:11:24.703 --> 00:11:27.749
YOU DIDN'T.
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.


231
00:11:27.793 --> 00:11:29.446
OK, I DIDN'T.

232
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.665
YOU DID.

233
00:11:30.709 --> 00:11:32.362
YOU STONEWALLED DUNCAN
ON HIS OWN COURT DATE.


234
00:11:32.406 --> 00:11:34.582
ROBIN, YOU'RE EITHER
GONNA WIND UP
ON THE SUPREME COURT


235
00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:36.453
OR IN SAN QUENTIN.

236
00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:39.718
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT.


237
00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:42.938
MAYBE I
SHOULDN'T HAVE.


238
00:11:43.852 --> 00:11:46.072
IT WAS UNETHICAL,
WASN'T IT?


239
00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:46.986
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

240
00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:47.987
ROBIN, YOU'RE
KIDDING, RIGHT?


241
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.249
YOU HEARD AMES.
IT'S A PIMPLE.


242
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.818
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
THINK OF IT MYSELF.


243
00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:55.777
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S A GREAT CASE.


244
00:11:55.821 --> 00:11:58.780
I GOT A GREAT GAME PLAN,
AND I CAN'T LOSE.


245
00:11:58.824 --> 00:12:00.651
I'M GONNA CALL JO ANN.

246
00:12:00.695 --> 00:12:02.697
[LAUGHTER]

247
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:03.785
[CHURCH BELLS RINGING]

248
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:06.179
ARE YOU GUYS
JUMPING AGAIN?


249
00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:07.615
ARE YOU?

250
00:12:07.658 --> 00:12:10.096
HI, SWEETHEART.

251
00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:11.401
MRS. JAMISON,
WOULD YOU TAKE


252
00:12:11.445 --> 00:12:12.576
THE KIDS FOR
A FEW MINUTES?


253
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.190
I'D APPRECIATE IT.
SILLY, ISN'T HE?
SILLY.


254
00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:18.191
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
SOME OF THESE KIDS


255
00:12:18.234 --> 00:12:20.280
COULDN'T TALK
WHEN WE GOT THEM.


256
00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:22.064
AND THEY'RE CLOSING
THIS PROGRAM DOWN.


257
00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:25.676
MORE OF THE RIGHT WING'S
WAR AGAINST WASTEFUL
SOCIAL PROGRAMMING.


258
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.766
SOMETIMES I THINK YOU'D
LIKE TO GIVE UP THE ACTING


259
00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:28.810
AND DO THIS STUFF
FULL TIME.


260
00:12:28.854 --> 00:12:30.594
NO. I CAN ONLY HAVE
MY HEART BROKEN


261
00:12:30.638 --> 00:12:31.813
A FEW HOURS A DAY.

262
00:12:31.857 --> 00:12:33.467
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.


263
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.294
WHAT?

264
00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.905
IT'S FOR YOUR
COLLECTION.


265
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:38.820
Robin: IT'S A
NEW DON WRIGHT.


266
00:12:38.864 --> 00:12:40.430
MM
-HMM.

267
00:12:40.474 --> 00:12:41.388
HA HA HA!

268
00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:42.302
YOU LIKE IT?

269
00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.957
OH, YEAH.
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL.


270
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.742
OH, MAN.

271
00:12:47.786 --> 00:12:48.830
DUNCAN.
YUP.


272
00:12:48.874 --> 00:12:49.831
YOU HAPPY?

273
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:50.614
OH, YEAH.

274
00:12:50.658 --> 00:12:52.094
I'M GONNA
GET IT FRAMED.


275
00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.835
SO TELL ME ALL ABOUT
THE CASE.


276
00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:55.010
CAN'T. I DON'T WANT
TO BE LATE


277
00:12:55.054 --> 00:12:56.577
FOR MY FIRST MEETING
WITH MY FIRST CLIENT.


278
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.230
OK.

279
00:12:57.273 --> 00:12:58.840
YOUR PLACE OR MINE?

280
00:12:58.884 --> 00:13:01.756
MINE. THERE'S A SLIGHT
PROBLEM WITH YOUR BED.


281
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.585
WELL, YOUR SIDE
OF THE BED.


282
00:13:04.628 --> 00:13:05.847
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY BED?


283
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:07.762
YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GONNA LET YOU
GET AWAY


284
00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:08.719
WITH THIS MORNING,
DID YOU?


285
00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:09.808
I WAS JUST
FOLLOWING ORDERS.


286
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:10.896
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
HITLER'S BOYS SAID.


287
00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:13.333
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY SIDE OF THE BED?


288
00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:17.424
I, UH, KIND OF TARRED
AND FEATHERED IT.


289
00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:18.947
YOU TARRED AND
FEATHERED MY BED?


290
00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:20.427
WITH HONEY
AND SALTINES.


291
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.863
YOU'RE SICK. YOU'RE SICK.

292
00:13:21.907 --> 00:13:23.256
I'LL UNDO IT.
I PROMISE.


293
00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:27.042
NOW THAT YOU'RE
A LITIGATOR,
YOU GET A BREAK.


294
00:13:28.522 --> 00:13:30.219
I LOVE YOU.

295
00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:32.395
I'LL SEE YOU.

296
00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:35.224
I GET TO PACE
UP AND DOWN


297
00:13:35.268 --> 00:13:39.881
AND WAVE MY ARMS
AND POUND ON TABLES.


298
00:13:39.925 --> 00:13:41.100
ROBIN?

299
00:13:41.143 --> 00:13:42.623
Robin: OK, WE DON'T
HAVE VERY MUCH TIME,


300
00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:44.843
SO LET'S GO OVER
YOUR TESTIMONY AND
DISCUSS YOUR DEFENSE.


301
00:13:44.886 --> 00:13:47.584
THERE'S NO DEFENSE,
AND I STRUCK THE MAN.


302
00:13:47.628 --> 00:13:48.542
EXCUSE ME?

303
00:13:48.585 --> 00:13:50.718
IT'S A LOSER.
JUST DRAG IT OUT.


304
00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:52.589
UH, I'M NOT SURE
THAT I FOLLOW.


305
00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:54.983
WELL, I WANT AT LEAST
A 3-DAY TRIAL,
RUN UP HIS FEES.


306
00:13:55.027 --> 00:13:57.594
HE MAY GET 50,
BUT I WANT IT
TO COST HIM 20.


307
00:13:57.638 --> 00:13:59.640
3 DAYS?
IT'S A ONE-DAY CASE.


308
00:13:59.683 --> 00:14:02.338
JUST STRETCH IT OUT.
THAT'S ALL I ASK.


309
00:14:02.382 --> 00:14:05.037
SIR, SHOULDN'T WE
TRY TO WIN?


310

00:40:14.822 --> 00:40:16.258
TO HAVE YOU AS A PARTNER.

928
00:40:16.302 --> 00:40:17.651
I APPRECIATE THAT,
ROBERTA,


929
00:40:17.695 --> 00:40:19.305
AND I HOPE THAT
I CAN LIVE UP TO
YOUR EXPECTATION.


930
00:40:19.348 --> 00:40:21.481
I PALPITATE
AT THE THOUGHT.


931
00:40:21.525 --> 00:40:23.962
THANK YOU. UM,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME NOW,


932
00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.267
I HAVE TO MEET
THE DECORATOR.


933
00:40:25.311 --> 00:40:27.792
HE'S HERE
ABOUT THE NEW OFFICE.


934
00:40:34.668 --> 00:40:37.454
All: ♪ FOR HE'S
A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪


935
00:40:37.497 --> 00:40:39.456

938
00:40:44.939 --> 00:40:46.898
THANK GOD HE'S DEAD.

939
00:40:46.941 --> 00:40:48.116
WHO?

940
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.509
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES,
WHO FOUNDED THIS FIRM.


941
00:40:49.553 --> 00:40:51.337
ROBERTA, HE'S
BEEN DEAD 50 YEARS.


942
00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.252
THE LONGER,
THE BETTER.


943
00:40:53.295 --> 00:40:55.297
LET'S NOT GET
CARRIED AWAY.


944
00:40:55.341 --> 00:40:57.952
HE'S A PARTNER NOW,
AND THAT'S THAT.


945
00:40:57.996 --> 00:40:59.737
STORMY WEATHERS.

946
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.523
COULDN'T WE AT LEAST
PUT AN ASTERISK
BESIDE HIS NAME?


947
00:41:03.567 --> 00:41:05.482
Roberta: YOU HAVE
A GREAT DEAL TO ANSWER FOR.


948
00:41:05.525 --> 00:41:06.874
Duncan: MY DEAR,
A GREAT LITIGATOR


949
00:41:06.918 --> 00:41:08.485
IS NEVER WITHOUT
AN ANSWER.


950
00:41:08.528 --> 00:41:12.401
MS. JENSEN,
BRING IT IN, PLEASE.


951
00:41:20.758 --> 00:41:23.369
AND THIS IS?

952
00:41:23.412 --> 00:41:24.588
THE BENOIT CASE.

953
00:41:24.631 --> 00:41:25.719
THE BENOIT CASE?

954
00:41:25.763 --> 00:41:28.113
WE DECIDED TO TURN DOWN
THE BENOIT CASE.


955
00:41:28.156 --> 00:41:30.550
Duncan: OH, YES,
WE DID. WHY?


956
00:41:30.594 --> 00:41:33.118
UNWINNABLE.
THE MAN WAS CAUGHT


957
00:41:33.161 --> 00:41:34.206
WITH THE MURDER
WEAPON


958
00:41:34.249 --> 00:41:35.599
AND THE VICTIM'S
BLOOD-STAINED CLOTHES


959
00:41:35.642 --> 00:41:37.470
UNDER THE SEAT
OF HIS CAR.


960
00:41:37.514 --> 00:41:41.474
EXACTLY. UNWINNABLE.

961
00:41:41.518 --> 00:41:44.390
DIABOLICAL.

962
00:41:44.433 --> 00:41:45.565
IT STINKS.

963
00:41:45.609 --> 00:41:47.524
YES, IT DOES.

964
00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:48.655
AND NOT ONLY THAT,

965
00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:50.527
BUT AT THE PROSPECT
OF BEING REPRESENTED


966
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.529
BY THE INCENDIARY
MR. WEATHERS,


967
00:41:52.572 --> 00:41:54.922
PROFESSOR BENOIT
WAS EASILY INDUCED


968
00:41:54.966 --> 00:41:59.405
TO PLUNKING DOWN
A RETAINER
OF $75,000.


969
00:41:59.448 --> 00:42:02.800
CRAIG, HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
HOW CYNICAL THIS IS?


970
00:42:02.843 --> 00:42:06.412
WHAT ABOUT OUR OBLIGATION
TO THE CLIENT?


971
00:42:06.455 --> 00:42:07.674
OH, YES.

972
00:42:07.718 --> 00:42:10.068
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'VE TAKEN A BIT
MORE CREDIT


973
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:11.417
THAN I DESERVE.

974
00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.986
BENOIT WANTS HIM.
HE DOESN'T WANT
ANYBODY ELSE.


975
00:42:15.029 --> 00:42:18.337
YOU TOLD HIM THE BOY
IS ONE YEAR OUT
OF LAW SCHOOL


976
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.599
WITH ONE TRIAL?

977
00:42:19.643 --> 00:42:22.646
ALL RIGHT. IF THE LITTLE
WEASEL STARTS TO SINK,


978
00:42:22.689 --> 00:42:24.517
I'LL BAIL HIM OUT.

979
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:27.433
WELL, I STILL
DON'T LIKE IT.


980
00:42:27.476 --> 00:42:28.913
WHAT NONE OF YOU
WANTS TO ADMIT


981
00:42:28.956 --> 00:42:31.437
IS THAT THE KID
IS GOOD.


982
00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.180
WE'LL SEE.

983
00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:37.399
YOU KNOW
THE BENOIT CASE?


984
00:42:37.443 --> 00:42:38.313
THE B.U. DOCTOR?

985
00:42:38.357 --> 00:42:39.619
I AM DEFENDING HIM!

986
00:42:39.663 --> 00:42:40.402
WHAT?

987
00:42:40.446 --> 00:42:41.447
YOU HEARD IT. ME.

988
00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:42.361
WHY?

989
00:42:42.404 --> 00:42:44.102
THE BASTARDS
ARE SETTING ME UP!


990
00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:45.407
IT'S A COMPLETE NO
-WIN.

991
00:42:45.451 --> 00:42:46.757
BUT IT'S A GREAT CHANCE.
YOU SHOULD BE THRILLED.


992
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.454
THRILLED? THERE COULD BE
A DEATH PENALTY.


993
00:42:48.497 --> 00:42:49.586
NOT FOR THE LAWYER.

994
00:42:49.629 --> 00:42:51.500
OH, FUNNY. MAYBE
I CAN GET HIM TO CONFESS


995
00:42:51.544 --> 00:42:52.850
OR PLEAD GUILTY.

996
00:42:52.893 --> 00:42:54.634
Steve: NOW, WOULDN'T
THAT BE SOMEWHAT
IN VIOLATION


997
00:42:54.678 --> 00:42:56.462
OF HIS MANDATE
AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY?


998
00:42:56.505 --> 00:42:58.638
SO WHAT?

999
00:42:58.682 --> 00:43:00.074
JESUS.

1000
00:43:00.118 --> 00:43:03.251
WHY YOU?

1001
00:43:03.295 --> 00:43:06.559
HOW STRANGE
YOU SHOULD ASK THAT.


1002
00:43:07.299 --> 00:43:09.562
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO YOU, MR. WEATHERS.


1003
00:43:09.606 --> 00:43:13.522
THROUGH THE VICISSITUDES
OF WHOLLY GRATUITOUS
GENETIC ACCIDENTS,


1004
00:43:13.566 --> 00:43:17.614
I WAS VISITED WITH
EXTREMELY HIGH INTELLIGENCE.


1005
00:43:17.657 --> 00:43:22.096
I WAS FURTHER BLESSED,
OR BURDENED, AS IT WERE,


1006
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.533
WITH CERTAIN PHYSICAL TRAITS
THAT WOULD SUGGEST,


1007
00:43:24.577 --> 00:43:28.189
SHALL WE SAY, GOOD BREEDING.

1008
00:43:28.233 --> 00:43:34.761
NOW, IN THIS PROLETARIAN
STEW WHICH TODAY WE
LAUGHINGLY CALL SOCIETY,


1009
00:43:34.805 --> 00:43:39.157
THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE NOT
ALWAYS ADVANTAGEOUS.


1010
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.640
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARE THE CURRENT MESSIAH
OF THE BLUE COLLAR,


1011
00:43:43.683 --> 00:43:50.168
THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE,
A SORT OF PISSED-OFF
ABE LINCOLN.


1012
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:54.128
MY STORY, WHICH
BY THE WAY IS TRUE,


1013
00:43:54.172 --> 00:43:56.348
WILL BE BETTER SERVED
IF YOU TELL IT.


1014
00:43:56.391 --> 00:43:59.699
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE
THAT I'M A CREATION
OF THE MEDIA.


1015
00:43:59.743 --> 00:44:01.701
I'VE ONLY TRIED ONE CASE
IN MY ENTIRE CAREER,


1016
00:44:01.745 --> 00:44:04.878
AND A MURDER CASE IS
A VERY COMPLEX BEAST.


1017
00:44:04.922 --> 00:44:07.011
MODESTY IS A BANAL
AND SELF-SERVING DEVICE.


1018
00:44:07.054 --> 00:44:08.403
IT REALLY DOESN'T
BECOME YOU.


1019
00:44:08.447 --> 00:44:11.929
AND DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
I HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR IT.


1020
00:44:11.972 --> 00:44:14.279
SAY WHAT YOU MEAN.

1021
00:44:14.322 --> 00:44:17.108
THIS CASE CAN'T BE WON.

1022
00:44:17.151 --> 00:44:18.849
I SAID WHAT I MEANT.

1023
00:44:18.892 --> 00:44:20.677
I DON'T HAVE
THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE


1024
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.330
NEEDED TO RECOGNIZE
THE TRAPS AND TRICKS


1025
00:44:22.374 --> 00:44:24.332
THAT CAN SWAY A VERDICT
EITHER WAY.


1026
00:44:24.376 --> 00:44:27.118
SCOTT MURRAY IS ACTING
FOR THE PROSECUTION.


1027
00:44:27.161 --> 00:44:28.728
I'M NOT BEING MODEST
WHEN I SAY THAT


1028
00:44:28.772 --> 00:44:31.775
I MAY BE IN
OVER MY HEAD.


1029
00:44:33.254 --> 00:44:34.560
NONSENSE.

1030
00:44:34.603 --> 00:44:36.475
I WAS THERE.

1031
00:44:36.518 --> 00:44:38.651
IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

1032
00:44:38.695 --> 00:44:39.696
Robin: THERE?

1033
00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:43.743
COME, COME, COME.
DON'T BE SO SLOW.


1034
00:44:43.787 --> 00:44:45.571
THE TORKENSON CASE.

1035
00:44:45.614 --> 00:44:47.355
YES.

1036
00:44:47.616 --> 00:44:49.575
YOU WERE REMARKABLY
INTUITIVE.


1037
00:44:49.618 --> 00:44:51.011
THAT WAS A SIMPLE
ASSAULT CASE.


1038
00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.621
IF YOU ANALYZE IT
UNEMOTIONALLY,


1039
00:44:52.665 --> 00:44:54.319
THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE
ASSAULT CASE


1040
00:44:54.362 --> 00:44:56.756
WITH SOMEWHAT MORE
DIRE RESULTS.


1041
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.801
IF YOU EQUATE
A BLOODY NOSE


1042
00:44:57.844 --> 00:44:59.759
WITH A HAMMER CLAW
THROUGH THE BRAIN.


1043
00:44:59.803 --> 00:45:03.328
A MATTER OF DEGREE ONLY,
MR. WEATHERS.


1044
00:45:03.371 --> 00:45:05.156
YOU HAVE THE GIFT.

1045
00:45:05.199 --> 00:45:08.942
IT WAS UNCANNY HOW
YOU ANTICIPATED
EVERY MOVE,


1046
00:45:08.986 --> 00:45:12.990
TURNED EVERY SUBTLETY
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.


1047
00:45:13.033 --> 00:45:15.688
BUT MOST IMPORTANT
OF ALL,


1048
00:45:15.732 --> 00:45:17.777
THEY LIKED YOU.

1049
00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:19.126
YOU HAVE THE COMMON TOUCH.

1050
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.172
THEY WANTED YOU TO WIN,
AND THEY WERE LOOKING


1051
00:45:21.215 --> 00:45:23.435
FOR ANY REASON
TO GIVE YOU THAT WIN.


1052
00:45:23.478 --> 00:45:26.003
WELL, THAT IS
WHAT I NEED.


1053
00:45:26.046 --> 00:45:28.396
THAT IS WHAT
I HAVE PAID FOR.


1054
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:34.054
AND ACCORDING
TO YOUR SUPERIORS,
THAT IS WHAT I WILL GET.


1055
00:45:35.795 --> 00:45:37.318
OH, WHAT
A SWEETHEART--


1056
00:45:37.362 --> 00:45:39.364
SORT OF A CROSS
BETWEEN CHARLES MANSON


1057
00:45:39.407 --> 00:45:40.582
AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY.

1058
00:45:40.626 --> 00:45:42.236
MY GOD. I CAN HEAR
MY OPENING
STATEMENT NOW.


1059
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.412
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I KNOW MY CLIENT
HAD A MOTIVE,


1060
00:45:44.456 --> 00:45:46.980
HAD OPPORTUNITY,
WAS CAUGHT WITH
THE MURDER WEAPON


1061
00:45:47.024 --> 00:45:48.460
AND THE VICTIM'S
BLOOD-STAINED CLOTHES


1062
00:45:48.503 --> 00:45:51.811
AND IS A SUPERIOR,
OBNOXIOUS,
ELITIST SWINE


1063
00:45:51.855 --> 00:45:53.073
WHO MAKES YOU
WANT TO THROW UP,


1064
00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:55.859
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO OVERLOOK ALL THAT.


1065
00:45:55.902 --> 00:45:57.730
OH, NOW, DON'T
UNDERESTIMATE
YOURSELF.


1066
00:45:57.774 --> 00:45:59.819
I MEAN, BASED ON
YOUR WORK ON
THE TORKENSON TRIAL,


1067
00:45:59.863 --> 00:46:02.256
I'D SAY BENOIT'S
LIFE IS IN
GOOD HANDS.


1068
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.477
LET'S GO. WE GOT TO
GET BACK TO WORK.


1069
00:46:21.058 --> 00:46:22.929
JO ANN?

1070
00:46:27.891 --> 00:46:29.718
JO ANN?

1071
00:46:38.902 --> 00:46:41.556
JO ANN?

1072
00:46:47.214 --> 00:46:50.130
I'M IN A BIT
OF TROUBLE.


1073
00:46:52.524 --> 00:46:54.439
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU.


1074
00:46:54.482 --> 00:46:58.443
THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING
YOU WHILE YOU'RE ASLEEP.


1075
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.927
YOU KNOW HOW I GOT
THE TRIAL,


1076
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.886
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW

1077
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:13.675
IS THAT COWENS AND I

EXAGGERATE WHAT WE DID.

BRIBE THE JUDGE

OR RIG THE TRIAL,

00:56:12.605 --> 00:56:14.041
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1228
00:56:14.085 --> 00:56:16.392
I THINK THIS IS
A REVOLUTIONARY
THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUE


1229
00:56:16.435 --> 00:56:17.654
THAT WE'VE
DEVELOPED HERE.


1230
00:56:17.697 --> 00:56:20.091
I MEAN, THIS KIND
OF COUNSELING
AIN'T CHEAP.


1231
00:56:20.134 --> 00:56:22.833
ALL RIGHT.

1232
00:56:22.876 --> 00:56:24.225
GIVE ME
A QUARTER'S WORTH.


1233
00:56:24.269 --> 00:56:25.575
A QUARTER'S WORTH?

1234
00:56:25.618 --> 00:56:27.620
WELL, YEAH.
DON'T I GET SOME KIND
OF A DISCOUNT?


1235
00:56:27.664 --> 00:56:28.839
YEAH. FOR
A QUARTER'S WORTH,


1236
00:56:28.882 --> 00:56:32.146
MY ADVICE IS
YOU SHOULD JUMP.


1237
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:35.367
WELL, WHAT DID YOU
WANT FOR A QUARTER?


1238
00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:38.979
I WANTED YOU TO TELL ME
I'M RIGHT.


1239
00:56:39.023 --> 00:56:42.113
CAN'T DO THAT.

1240
00:56:42.156 --> 00:56:45.290
I CAN TELL YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU.


1241
00:56:45.333 --> 00:56:48.336
I CAN TELL YOU
THAT I UNDERSTAND.


1242
00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.948
I CAN TELL YOU THAT
YOU'RE ONE OF A KIND


1243
00:56:50.991 --> 00:56:54.038
AND THAT YOU GOT
A GOOD HEART,


1244
00:56:54.081 --> 00:56:57.302
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.


1245
00:56:57.345 --> 00:56:58.259
YOU THINK I'M WRONG?

1246
00:56:58.303 --> 00:57:01.219
OF COURSE YOU WERE
WRONG, ROBIN.


1247
00:57:01.262 --> 00:57:03.569
DON'T COME TO ME
FOR ABSOLUTION,
ALL RIGHT?


1248
00:57:03.613 --> 00:57:05.441
I'M NOT YOUR MOTHER
OR A PRIEST.


1249
00:57:05.484 --> 00:57:07.138
I'M YOUR LOVER.

1250
00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:09.488
I MEAN, YOU'D HAVE
TO COME UP JUST
SHORT OF MURDER


1251
00:57:09.532 --> 00:57:11.925
FOR ME NOT TO
SUPPORT YOU,


1252
00:57:11.969 --> 00:57:15.363
BUT YOU CAN'T ASK ME
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.


1253
00:57:16.277 --> 00:57:18.497
JUST GO OUT THERE
AND BE A GOOD GUY.


1254
00:57:18.541 --> 00:57:22.501
IT'S ALL THAT
I CAN TELL YOU.


1255
00:57:22.545 --> 00:57:25.504
FAIR?

1256
00:57:25.548 --> 00:57:27.506
FAIR.

1257
00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:29.856
WE GONNA TAKE
THE CASE?


1258
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.468
YES.

1259
00:57:32.511 --> 00:57:33.512
IS HE GUILTY?

1260
00:57:33.556 --> 00:57:34.382
HE SAYS NOT.

1261
00:57:34.426 --> 00:57:35.514
THEY ALL SAY NOT.

1262
00:57:35.558 --> 00:57:37.647
THAT'S WHY THEY ALL
HAVE TO BE DEFENDED.


1263
00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.126
THAT'S JUSTICE.

1264
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:41.128
YEAH. WITH ALL
THE JUSTICE THERE IS
IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM,


1265
00:57:41.172 --> 00:57:43.522
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
PLAY SPIN
THE BOTTLE.


1266
00:57:43.566 --> 00:57:46.525
WHOEVER IT POINTS TO
WINS.


1267
00:57:46.569 --> 00:57:49.397
HA HA HA! SORRY.

1268
00:57:49.441 --> 00:57:50.790
OHH!

1269
00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.357
[COUGHS]

1270
00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.403
THAT'S GREAT.
YOU'VE JUST INVALIDATED
MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE.


1271
00:57:55.447 --> 00:57:56.622
I THINK I'LL JUMP.

1272
00:57:56.666 --> 00:57:59.407
NO. THERE'S
A CELTICS GAME
TOMORROW NIGHT.


1273
00:57:59.451 --> 00:58:00.670
LOOK. ALL I'M
SAYING IS,


1274
00:58:00.713 --> 00:58:02.976
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL
THAT WE'VE GOT.


1275
00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:05.544
I JUST--I JUST
FEEL LIKE WE
SHOULD BE GIVING


1276
00:58:05.588 --> 00:58:07.024
SOME OF IT BACK,

1277
00:58:07.067 --> 00:58:09.330
AND I'M NOT SAYING
THAT WE SHOULD BE
SAINTS OR MARTYRS.


1278
00:58:09.374 --> 00:58:10.549
I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO LAND SOMEWHERE


1279
00:58:10.593 --> 00:58:14.945
BETWEEN
MOTHER TERESA
AND IMELDA MARCOS.


1280
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:18.644
SORRY.

1281
00:58:18.688 --> 00:58:19.732
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.


1282
00:58:19.776 --> 00:58:23.127
WE'LL BE THE FIRST
YUPPIE MISSIONARIES


1283
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.303
WITH ALL THE SHOES
WE CAN EAT.


1284
00:58:25.346 --> 00:58:27.914
QUEER. I KNOW.
IT'S QUEER.
IT'S REALLY DUMB.


1285
00:58:27.958 --> 00:58:31.091
I LOVE YOU,
YOU KNOW?


1286
00:58:33.311 --> 00:58:34.704
I KNOW.

1287
00:58:36.923 --> 00:58:39.143
IT KEEPS ME GOING.

1288
00:58:45.366 --> 00:58:46.890
CANDY MEAD,
BENOIT'S FORMER MISTRESS.


1289
00:58:46.933 --> 00:58:49.283
CAN'T FIND HER.
SHE'S MARRIED
AND RELOCATED.


1290
00:58:49.327 --> 00:58:50.284
YOU'VE GOT TO
FIND HER.


1291
00:58:50.328 --> 00:58:51.590
WE CAN'T ALLOW
THE JURY TO BELIEVE


1292
00:58:51.634 --> 00:58:52.896
FOR A FRACTION
OF A SECOND


1293
00:58:52.939 --> 00:58:53.897
THAT BENOIT'S CAPABLE
OF THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE.


1294
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.898
IF HE EVER HIT
THIS CANDY MEAD,


1295
00:58:54.941 --> 00:58:56.595
THAT'S IT,
WE'RE THROUGH.


1296
00:58:56.639 --> 00:58:57.814
PUT ANOTHER DETECTIVE
ON IT.


1297
00:58:57.857 --> 00:58:58.815
ALL RIGHT.

1298
00:58:58.858 --> 00:58:59.772
NOW DID YOU TALK
TO BENOIT'S WIFE?


1299
00:58:59.816 --> 00:59:00.904
GAVE HER
THE WHOLE LITANY--


1300
00:59:00.947 --> 00:59:02.079
SMILE,
HOLD HIS HAND,
BE UNDERSTANDING.


1301
00:59:02.122 --> 00:59:04.037
SHE'S ACTUALLY
VERY SUPPORTIVE
OF HIM.


1302
00:59:04.081 --> 00:59:05.299
AND HOW WAS BENOIT?

1303
00:59:05.343 --> 00:59:07.214
IT WAS ONE
OF HIS GOOD DAYS--
WARM, CHARMING.


1304
00:59:07.258 --> 00:59:08.520
YOU COULD ACTUALLY
PUT HIM ON THE STAND


1305
00:59:08.564 --> 00:59:09.869
IF HE SHOWED
THIS SIDE
OF HIMSELF.


1306
00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:11.131
YEAH? THE GUY'S
A CHAMELEON.


1307
00:59:11.175 --> 00:59:13.481
I CANNOT GET
A FIX ON HIM.


1308
00:59:13.525 --> 00:59:16.528
[TARZAN YELL]

1309
00:59:18.051 --> 00:59:19.923
DO I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?

1310
00:59:19.966 --> 00:59:21.751
Robin: SIT DOWN.

1311
00:59:21.794 --> 00:59:23.013
I FOUND HIM.
WHO?


1312
00:59:23.056 --> 00:59:25.581
A PATHOLOGIST,
DR. C.R. PECKHAM.


1313
00:59:25.624 --> 00:59:26.886
NOW HE'S WILLING
TO STATE


1314
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.758
THAT BASED
ON THE BLOOD SAMPLE
FROM HER JACKET


1315
00:59:28.801 --> 00:59:30.586
THAT LIZA WILLIAMS
DIED MORE THAN A WEEK


1316
00:59:30.629 --> 00:59:31.761
AFTER SHE WAS SEEN
WITH BENOIT.


1317
00:59:31.804 --> 00:59:33.589
THAT IS GREAT!
PECKHAM'S ONE
OF THE BEST.


1318
00:59:33.632 --> 00:59:35.503
HE'S GONNA BE GOOD
ON THE STAND, TOO.


1319
00:59:35.547 --> 00:59:37.027
HE'S FIRM, FEISTY,
SENSE OF HUMOR.


1320
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.507
THAT BLOWS MURRAY'S
PATHOLOGIST RIGHT
OUT OF THE WATER.


1321
00:59:39.551 --> 00:59:42.510
NOW ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS KEEP MURRAY
FROM PAINTING BENOIT


1322
00:59:42.554 --> 00:59:44.469
AS A VIOLENT WOMANIZER.

1323
00:59:44.512 --> 00:59:45.513
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE MISSED?


1324
00:59:45.557 --> 00:59:46.427
I DON'T SEE HOW.

1325
00:59:46.471 --> 00:59:47.472
WE'VE EMPANELLED
A GOOD JURY.


1326
00:59:47.515 --> 00:59:49.517
WE'VE BEEN OVER
EVERYTHING 10 TIMES.


1327
00:59:49.561 --> 00:59:50.823
I THINK WE'RE READY.

1328
00:59:50.867 --> 00:59:53.434
WE'RE READY.
WE'RE READY.


1329
00:59:53.478 --> 00:59:55.480
WE'RE READY.

1330
00:59:59.484 --> 01:00:01.007
Man: ALL RISE!

1331
01:00:01.051 --> 01:00:01.878
ALL RISE.

1332
01:00:01.921 --> 01:00:03.793
HEAR YE, HEAR YE,
HEAR YE.


1333
01:00:03.836 --> 01:00:05.751
LIONS AND TIGERS
AND BEARS, OH, MY.


1334
01:00:05.795 --> 01:00:08.058
ALL YE WHO HAVE BUSINESS
BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT


1335
01:00:08.101 --> 01:00:09.407
IN AND OF THE COUNTY
OF SUFFOLK


1336
01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.149
IN THE COMMONWEALTH
OF MASSACHUSETTS
DRAW NEAR.


1337
01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:15.021
GIVE YOUR ATTENTION,
AND YOU SHALL BE HEARD.


1338
01:00:15.065 --> 01:00:16.544
BE SEATED.

1339
01:00:18.242 --> 01:00:20.679
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO,


1340
01:00:20.723 --> 01:00:22.594
SO LET'S GET TO IT.

1341
01:00:22.638 --> 01:00:24.857
MR. MURRAY,
MR. WEATHERS,


1342
01:00:24.901 --> 01:00:27.947
WE HAD REASONABLE DECORUM
IN THE PRETRIAL HEARINGS.


1343
01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:29.688
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THAT CONTINUE.


1344
01:00:29.732 --> 01:00:32.648
BRING THE JURY
IN, PLEASE.


1345
01:00:38.654 --> 01:00:41.961
IS THE COMMONWEALTH
READY TO OPEN?


1346
01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.180
WE ARE, YOUR HONOR.

1347
01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:45.617
AND THE DEFENDANT'S
COUNSEL, ARE YOU READY?


1348
01:00:45.661 --> 01:00:46.662
YES, YOUR HONOR.

1349
01:00:46.705 --> 01:00:50.361
VERY WELL.
MR. MURRAY, PROCEED.


1350
01:00:56.672 --> 01:00:58.674
GOOD MORNING.GOOD MORNING.

1351
01:00:58.717 --> 01:00:59.631
HOW ARE YOU?

1352
01:00:59.675 --> 01:01:01.546
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,


1353
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:04.331
LET ME BEGIN
BY SAYING I'M SORRY.


1354
01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:08.596
I'M SORRY BECAUSE WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO DO
IS NOT VERY KIND.


1355
01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.686
I'M GOING TO TAKE

1356
01:01:10.729 --> 01:01:14.733
MOST OF YOU LEADING
GOOD, HAPPY LIVES
WITH LOVELY FAMILIES.


1357
01:01:14.777 --> 01:01:21.653
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU LIVE
THROUGH THE ULTIMATE
SIN OF MAN--MURDER.


1358
01:01:21.697 --> 01:01:28.355
YOU SEE, IT'S MY JOB
TO MAKE YOU FEEL THE HORROR
LITTLE LISA WILLIAMS FACED.


1359
01:01:28.399 --> 01:01:30.749
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
TO CLOSE YOUR EYES


1360
01:01:30.793 --> 01:01:33.534
AND HEAR THE SICK SOUND
OF CRUSHING BONE


1361
01:01:33.578 --> 01:01:35.667
AS THE DEFENDANT
REPEATEDLY BLUDGEONED


1362
01:01:35.711 --> 01:01:37.800
A HELPLESS 22
-YEAR
-OLD GIRL.

1363
01:01:37.843 --> 01:01:43.762
IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE YOU
HEAR THE HOLLOW CRACKLE
OF A BASHED SKULL


1364
01:01:43.806 --> 01:01:51.204
AS THE DEFENDANT BEAT
AND BEAT AND BEAT HIS PREY.


1365
01:01:51.248 --> 01:01:54.164
YOU'LL ALMOST BE ABLE TO SEE
THE SPATTERING OF BLOOD


1366
01:01:54.207 --> 01:01:56.122
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
ALL OVER THE DEFENDANT


1367
01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:59.822
WHEN HE FINISHED
THIS ACT OF TERROR.


1368
01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.130
I'M SORRY.

1369
01:02:04.174 --> 01:02:08.221
BUT IT'S MY JOB
TO TELL YOU HOW LIFE ENDED.


1370
01:02:08.265 --> 01:02:12.225
IT'S YOUR JOB TO DECIDE
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.


1371
01:02:19.842 --> 01:02:23.193
MR. WEATHERS,
DO YOU CARE TO OPEN?


1372
01:02:23.236 --> 01:02:25.151
YES, YOUR HONOR.

1373
01:02:31.636 --> 01:02:35.814
EVIDENCE.
MM-HMM.


1374
01:02:35.858 --> 01:02:38.164
THAT'S TAGGED,
YOU KNOW.


1375
01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:40.601

01:09:59.866 --> 01:10:01.216
JO ANN, THIS IS GREAT.

1526
01:10:01.259 --> 01:10:03.870
I LOVE IT.

1527
01:10:03.914 --> 01:10:05.307
COME HERE.

1528
01:10:09.224 --> 01:10:11.269
I THINK IT PUTS
THE WHOLE THING
INTO PERSPECTIVE,


1529
01:10:11.313 --> 01:10:12.966
DON'T YOU?

1530
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:17.449
YEAH. WELL, IT DOES
SUM UP THE WAY I'VE
BEEN HANDLING THIS CASE.


1531
01:10:17.493 --> 01:10:20.191
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
WRONG, DON'T YOU?


1532
01:10:20.235 --> 01:10:21.497
WHAT?

1533
01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:24.543
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT I CAME HERE
TODAY LOOKING


1534
01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.632
FOR STORMY WEATHERS?

1535
01:10:26.676 --> 01:10:30.201
EVERYBODY
IS LOOKING
FOR STORMY WEATHERS.


1536
01:10:30.245 --> 01:10:31.855
I FAKED MY WAY
INTO A MURDER TRIAL,


1537
01:10:31.898 --> 01:10:34.292
ONLY THIS TIME
I DON'T HAVE A BLUEPRINT.


1538
01:10:34.336 --> 01:10:35.728
ROBIN, YOU'VE
GOT TO LOOK


1539
01:10:35.772 --> 01:10:37.991
AT THE TORKENSON
CASE OBJECTIVELY.


1540
01:10:38.035 --> 01:10:41.995
OK. YOU WON
BECAUSE YOU USED
YOUR IMAGINATION.


1541
01:10:42.039 --> 01:10:46.217
YOU JUST
DISGUISED IT AS
STORMY WEATHERS.


1542
01:10:46.261 --> 01:10:48.306
YOU CAME UP WITH
THE ASS DEFENSE,


1543
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:49.960
YOU SEIZED
ON WILBY'S JOURNAL


1544
01:10:50.003 --> 01:10:51.744
AND TURNED IT INTO
A CREDIBILITY ISSUE,


1545
01:10:51.788 --> 01:10:55.182
YOU INVENTED THE WHOLE
SUSIE WALKER DEFENSE.


1546
01:10:55.226 --> 01:10:57.663
YOU WERE THINKING
ON YOUR FEET.


1547
01:10:57.707 --> 01:10:59.665
THAT'S WHAT WON IT
FOR YOU.


1548
01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:04.148
YOU WERE
STORMY WEATHERS.


1549
01:11:04.191 --> 01:11:06.411
THAT'S QUITE
AN ANALYSIS.


1550
01:11:06.455 --> 01:11:09.196
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S ACCURATE,


1551
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.677
BUT IT'S ASTUTE.

1552
01:11:11.721 --> 01:11:14.332
ACTUALLY, I HAD
SOME COUNSELING.


1553
01:11:14.376 --> 01:11:16.334
OH. FROM WHO?

1554
01:11:16.378 --> 01:11:17.204
MATT COWENS.

1555
01:11:17.248 --> 01:11:18.467
YOU WENT TO SEE
COWENS?


1556
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:20.338
NO. HE CAME TO
SEE ME.


1557
01:11:20.382 --> 01:11:21.948
I MEAN, HE COULDN'T
COME SEE YOU.


1558
01:11:21.992 --> 01:11:25.169
THAT WOULD BE
UNETHICAL.


1559
01:11:25.212 --> 01:11:28.215
HE THOUGHT THAT
YOU WOULD FIND
THAT IRONIC,


1560
01:11:28.259 --> 01:11:30.261
BUT HE MEANT IT.

1561
01:11:30.305 --> 01:11:32.785
HE'S CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.
YEAH.


1562
01:11:32.829 --> 01:11:34.352
HE'S ALSO ANNOYED.

1563
01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:38.313
HE SAYS THAT BENOIT
ENTRUSTED HIS LIFE
TO STORMY WEATHERS,


1564
01:11:38.356 --> 01:11:40.358
HE PAID
FOR STORMY WEATHERS,


1565
01:11:40.402 --> 01:11:45.232
AND HE SUGGESTS
THAT YOU GIVE HIM
STORMY WEATHERS.


1566
01:11:45.276 --> 01:11:46.408
GOOD GRIEF.

1567
01:11:46.451 --> 01:11:48.235
HE SAYS IT
DOESN'T MATTER.


1568
01:11:48.279 --> 01:11:52.327
THEY'RE GONNA KICK
YOUR BUTT ANYWAY.


1569
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:53.371
HE SAID THAT?

1570
01:11:53.415 --> 01:11:55.373
HE SAID IT.

1571
01:11:55.417 --> 01:11:58.898
THEY THINK THEY CAN
HANDLE STORMY WEATHERS?


1572
01:12:02.337 --> 01:12:05.470
WELL, UM,
HOW ABOUT YOU?


1573
01:12:05.514 --> 01:12:07.385
WHAT'S THE NEWS,
GOOD AND BAD?


1574
01:12:07.429 --> 01:12:10.170
STARTED REHEARSALS
FOR THE REVERE
WHARF THEATER.


1575
01:12:10.214 --> 01:12:12.825
THAT'S BAD.
THAT'S GOOD.


1576
01:12:12.869 --> 01:12:14.305
IT'S A GOOD PART.
YEAH?


1577
01:12:14.349 --> 01:12:15.480
DO THEY HAVE
SEATS NOW?


1578
01:12:15.524 --> 01:12:16.873
YES. LITTLE ONES.

1579
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:21.486
UM, THE SUNSHINE
SCHOOL CLOSES IN
A COUPLE OF DAYS.


1580
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:24.402
THAT'S BAD.
THAT'S BAD.


1581
01:12:24.446 --> 01:12:26.361
GET STARTED ON IT
RIGHT AWAY.


1582
01:12:26.404 --> 01:12:27.405
ROBIN, THIS IS
A LOT OF WORK.


1583
01:12:27.449 --> 01:12:28.406
WE CAN'T START
A NEW CASE RIGHT NOW.


1584
01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:29.668
NO. IT'S NOT A CASE.
IT'S A MOTION.


1585
01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.278
GET LEAVITT
TO WRITE IT.
HE OWES ME A FAVOR.


1586
01:12:31.322 --> 01:12:33.498
LISTEN. I WANT TO
FILE IT TWO DAYS.


1587
01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:34.760
GO. THANKS.

1588
01:12:34.804 --> 01:12:36.675
MR. WEATHERS,
YOUR FIRST WITNESS, PLEASE.


1589
01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.416
UH, YES, YOUR HONOR.
THE DEFENSE CALLS


1590
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.680
DR. CHARLES PECKHAM
TO THE STAND.


1591
01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:42.812
THIS IS THE SAME
DR. CH--


1592
01:12:42.855 --> 01:12:44.117
YES, YOUR HONOR.
THE VERY SAME DOCTOR


1593
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:46.250
THAT MR. MURRAY
ATTEMPTED TO
DISCREDIT EARLIER


1594
01:12:46.293 --> 01:12:48.295
IN THE TRIAL.

1595
01:12:49.906 --> 01:12:51.386
DOCTOR.

1596
01:12:53.997 --> 01:12:56.608
Judge: I REMIND YOU, DOCTOR,
YOU'RE STILL UNDER OATH.


1597
01:12:56.652 --> 01:12:57.957
Peckham:
YES, YOUR HONOR.


1598
01:12:58.001 --> 01:13:01.526
NOW, DOCTOR,
MR. MURRAY DISMISSED
YOU AS AN EXPERT


1599
01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:04.311
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
SPECIALIZE IN
POLYMER CHEMISTRY,


1600
01:13:04.355 --> 01:13:05.661
IS THAT RIGHT?

1601
01:13:05.704 --> 01:13:06.792
YES.

1602
01:13:06.836 --> 01:13:09.404
FINE. COULD YOU
KINDLY TELL
THE COURT


1603
01:13:09.447 --> 01:13:12.319
HOW MUCH YAK MANURE
IS DEPOSITED
ANNUALLY


1604
01:13:12.363 --> 01:13:13.582
ON THE PLAINS
OF RAPSHU?


1605
01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:15.279
WHAT? I OBJECT.

1606
01:13:15.322 --> 01:13:17.890
THIS IS GOING
SOMEPLACE, COUNSELOR?


1607
01:13:17.934 --> 01:13:18.978
YES, YOUR HONOR.

1608
01:13:19.022 --> 01:13:20.806
WILL YOU TRY AND GET
THERE IN A HURRY?


1609
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:22.112
DOCTOR?

1610
01:13:22.155 --> 01:13:25.245
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT AN EXPERT
IN YAK MANURE.


1611
01:13:25.289 --> 01:13:27.160
FINE. COULD YOU
TELL US, THEN,


1612
01:13:27.204 --> 01:13:29.424
THE AMOUNT
OF BAT GUANO
ACCUMULATED MONTHLY


1613
01:13:29.467 --> 01:13:32.383
BY THE FLAPPED-WING
CHILEAN FRUIT BAT?


1614
01:13:32.427 --> 01:13:33.428
I OBJECT!

1615
01:13:33.471 --> 01:13:34.559
WHAT DOES
BAT GUANO
AND YAK MANURE


1616
01:13:34.603 --> 01:13:35.908
HAVE TO DO
WITH THIS CASE?


1617
01:13:35.952 --> 01:13:37.301
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT HAS TO DO
WITH THIS CASE!


1618
01:13:37.344 --> 01:13:40.130
IT HAS AS MUCH TO DO
WITH IT AS POLYMER CHEMISTRY.


1619
01:13:40.173 --> 01:13:43.655
EXACTLY NOTHING.
IT IS ALL A LOT OF CRAP!


1620
01:13:43.699 --> 01:13:44.787
BECAUSE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,


1621
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:47.006
THIS CASE IS NOT
ABOUT POLYMER CHEMISTRY.


1622
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:48.617
IT IS ABOUT MURDER
AND BLOOD,


1623
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.793
AND THIS GENTLEMAN HERE
HAS STUDIED BLOOD
AND BLOOD SAMPLES


1624
01:13:50.836 --> 01:13:52.403
FOR THE PAST 18 YEARS.

1625
01:13:52.447 --> 01:13:54.013
HE STUDIED
THE VICTIM'S BLOOD


1626
01:13:54.057 --> 01:13:55.450
AND THE BLOOD
-STAINED JACKET,

1627
01:13:55.493 --> 01:13:57.408
AND HE KNOWS DAMN WELL
WHAT THOSE BLOOD STAINS REVEAL!


1628
01:13:57.452 --> 01:13:59.541
AND AS FOR MR. MURRAY'S
LITTLE FORAY


1629

INTO POLYMER CHEMISTRY

WELL, YOUR HONOR,
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT WAS.


1632
01:14:06.678 --> 01:14:09.507
THAT WAS A LOT
OF YAK MANURE.

Robin: AND YOU
CONCLUDED,
LIEUTENANT SOSHA,


1637
01:14:18.908 --> 01:14:20.300
THAT SINCE
THE MURDER WEAPON


1638
01:14:20.344 --> 01:14:21.693
AND THE BLOOD-STAINED
CLOTHES WERE FOUND
IN HIS CAR,


1639
01:14:21.737 --> 01:14:24.435
THE MURDER MUST
HAVE BEEN COMMITTED
BY DR. BENOIT.


1640
01:14:24.479 --> 01:14:26.655
WELL, THAT WAS
STRONG EVIDENCE, YES.


1641
01:14:26.698 --> 01:14:29.440
BUT YOU DIDN'T FIND
ANY FINGERPRINTS,
DID YOU?


1642
01:14:29.484 --> 01:14:31.007
NO.

1643
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.443
AND DOES IT SEEM STRANGE

1644
01:14:32.487 --> 01:14:33.531
THAT SOMEONE WOULD
BE SO CAREFUL


1645
01:14:33.575 --> 01:14:35.446
TO WIPE AWAY
EVERY SINGLE
FINGERPRINT


1646
01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:37.230
AND THEN LEAVE
THE MURDER WEAPON
IN HIS CAR


1647
01:14:37.274 --> 01:14:38.536
FOR SOMEONE
TO FIND?


1648
01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.060
WELL, IT'S
A LITTLE UNUSUAL.


1649
01:14:41.104 --> 01:14:42.975
UNUSUAL?

1650
01:14:43.019 --> 01:14:44.890
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
THAT SOMEONE ELSE


1651
01:14:44.934 --> 01:14:46.892
PUT THOSE ITEMS
UNDER THE DEFENDANT'S
CAR SEAT?


1652
01:14:46.936 --> 01:14:50.766
IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT WHY DIDN'T HE
CALL THE POLICE?


1653
01:14:50.809 --> 01:14:52.463
NO. HE KNEW THE STUFF
WAS IN THE CAR.


1654
01:14:52.507 --> 01:14:53.551
IT WAS RIGHT
UNDER HIM.


1655
01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:55.684
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
HE DIDN'T KNOW?


1656
01:14:55.727 --> 01:14:58.338
HE WAS SITTING
RIGHT OVER IT,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.


1657
01:14:58.382 --> 01:15:02.081
SO IT WOULD BE
RIDICULOUS FOR HIM
TO HAVE NOT KNOWN?


1658
01:15:02.125 --> 01:15:03.561
ABSOLUTELY.

1659
01:15:03.605 --> 01:15:04.780
THEN IT WOULD BE
RIDICULOUS


1660
01:15:04.823 --> 01:15:06.390
FOR SOMEONE
NOT TO KNOW THAT
HE WAS SITTING


1661
01:15:06.433 --> 01:15:08.566

01:15:23.059 --> 01:15:24.147

HE NEVER LAID

SKULL OUT


1826
01:24:15.156 --> 01:24:16.766
OF PRIMITIVE
PASSION.


1827
01:24:16.809 --> 01:24:19.682
I MEAN, THE KIND
OF MEASURED,
DISPASSIONATE ACTION


1828
01:24:19.725 --> 01:24:24.121
THAT COMES
FROM ABSOLUTE
CLARITY OF MIND,


1829
01:24:24.165 --> 01:24:29.170
TRANSCENDS
RATIONAL THOUGHT.


1830
01:24:29.213 --> 01:24:31.128
THE KIND OF ACTION
THAT SPRINGS


1831
01:24:31.172 --> 01:24:32.956
FROM ABSOLUTE
NECESSITY,


1832
01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:37.178
UNCLOUDED
BY THE RESTRAINTS
OF CONSCIENCE,


1833
01:24:37.221 --> 01:24:40.094
MERCY, PITY.

1834
01:24:42.008 --> 01:24:45.316
THE KIND OF ACTION
THAT ALLOWS ONE TO TAKE


1835
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.406
A COMMON, ORDINARY HAMMER
AND WITH CLINICAL PRECISION


1836
01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:53.977
SPLIT A SKULL SO CLEANLY
THAT THE CRANIUM CRACKS
RIGHT THROUGH THE MEDULLA,


1837
01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:57.546
ALLOWING THE CLAW
OF THE HAMMER TO BE USED


1838
01:24:57.589 --> 01:25:00.810
TO PRY BACK
THE SKULL CLEANLY,


1839
01:25:00.853 --> 01:25:07.860
EXPOSING THE BRAIN
WHILE THE SUBJECT
REMAINS ALIVE,


1840
01:25:07.904 --> 01:25:12.169
EVEN AWARE.

1841
01:25:12.213 --> 01:25:17.914
SUCH A MAN IS
TO BE ENVIED,
REVERED,


1842
01:25:17.957 --> 01:25:19.307
AND MUCH FEARED.

1843
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:25.400
NEVER PARALYZED
BY IMPOTENCE OF WILL.


1844
01:25:30.187 --> 01:25:34.104
LUTHER MOSES MAY WELL
HAVE ENCOUNTERED
SUCH A MAN,


1845
01:25:34.148 --> 01:25:36.193
AND LIZA WILLIAMS,

1846
01:25:36.237 --> 01:25:42.591
AND LIZA WILLIAMS' MOTHER
MUST FEAR SUCH A MAN.


1847
01:25:42.634 --> 01:25:47.683
EVEN YOU MAY ENCOUNTER
SUCH A MAN SOMEDAY.


1848
01:25:53.254 --> 01:25:59.738
DO NOT INVOLVE YOURSELF
IN BETRAYAL, MR. WEATHERS.


1849
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:09.008
BUT IF YOU IMAGINE
THAT I AM SUCH A MAN...


1850
01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:14.188
THEN YOUR JUDGMENT
IS CLOUDED INDEED.


1851
01:26:14.231 --> 01:26:15.798
OH. I MERELY
TELL YOU THIS
SO THAT YOU KNOW


1852
01:26:15.841 --> 01:26:19.236
THE SORT OF MAN
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.


1853
01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.891
I AM A PROFESSOR
OF ENGLISH
LITERATURE.


1854
01:26:21.934 --> 01:26:24.589
IN SHORT,
A SOMEWHAT
DISAGREEABLE


1855
01:26:24.633 --> 01:26:27.592
BUT BENIGN
ENGLISH TEACHER,


1856
01:26:27.636 --> 01:26:32.641
A PERCEPTIVE
BUT INNOCENT MAN.


1857
01:26:32.684 --> 01:26:35.252
SO DO LET'S GET ON
WITH IT, GENTLEMEN.


1858
01:26:35.296 --> 01:26:37.254
GOOD DAY TO YOU ALL.

1859
01:26:46.307 --> 01:26:47.917
OH, MY GOD.

1860
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.745
THAT WAS QUITE
A SHOW.


1861
01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:52.095
SHOW? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?


1862
01:26:52.138 --> 01:26:53.966
HE RIPPED HER SKULL OPEN.

1863
01:26:54.010 --> 01:26:55.316
GOD KNOWS WHAT HE DID
TO MOSES,


1864
01:26:55.359 --> 01:26:56.882
AND GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S
GONNA DO TO LIZA'S MOTHER.


1865
01:26:56.926 --> 01:26:57.927
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.

1866
01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:59.711
ROBIN, I THINK HE
WANTS A MISTRIAL.


1867
01:26:59.755 --> 01:27:02.148
THE ACQUITTAL RATIO
GOES UP DRAMATICALLY
IN SECOND TRIALS.


1868
01:27:02.192 --> 01:27:04.281
YOU KNOW THAT.
HE KNOWS THAT.


1869
01:27:04.325 --> 01:27:07.066
NOW YOU HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO BASIS
WHATSOEVER


1870
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.980
FOR WITHDRAWAL.

1871
01:27:08.024 --> 01:27:08.981
HE ADMITTED NOTHING.

1872
01:27:09.025 --> 01:27:10.418
HE THREATENED
MRS. WILLIAMS' LIFE.


1873
01:27:10.461 --> 01:27:12.115
LISTEN. WE'RE
REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE COURT.


1874
01:27:12.158 --> 01:27:13.377
WE'RE OBLIGATED
TO REVEAL THAT.


1875
01:27:13.421 --> 01:27:15.510
IT WAS A HYPOTHETICAL
STATEMENT,


1876
01:27:15.553 --> 01:27:17.120
A VEILED THREAT
AT BEST.


1877
01:27:17.163 --> 01:27:18.295
MAYBE HE WANTS
TO BE GUILTY.


1878
01:27:18.339 --> 01:27:19.340
I MEAN, IT HAPPENS.

1879
01:27:19.383 --> 01:27:21.037
ALL THIS
IMPLIED VIOLENCE


1880
01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.300
IS CONTRADICTORY
TO HIS ESTABLISHED
BEHAVIOR.


1881
01:27:23.344 --> 01:27:25.041
THAT'S
THE WEAK LINK
FOR THE PROSECUTION.


1882
01:27:25.084 --> 01:27:27.826
THE GUY HASN'T SHOWN
THE SLIGHTEST
TENDENCY TO VIOLENCE.


1883
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:31.482
THE TRUTH IS,
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE TRUTH IS,


1884
01:27:31.526 --> 01:27:35.181
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS.


1885
01:27:35.225 --> 01:27:37.793
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?


1886
01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:39.925
I'M GOING HOME.

1887
01:27:43.581 --> 01:27:46.236
THIS ISN'T FUN
ANYMORE.


1888
01:27:47.368 --> 01:27:51.981
I'M SORRY, ROBIN,
BUT THEORIES DON'T MEAN
THAT MUCH TO ME.


1889
01:27:52.024 --> 01:27:55.376
I JUST KEEP SEEING
THAT POOR WOMAN.


1890
01:27:55.419 --> 01:27:57.203
GOD. YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD ME ALL THAT.


1891
01:27:57.247 --> 01:28:00.337
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE.


1892
01:28:00.381 --> 01:28:02.208
YEAH. YOU SHOULD HAVE.

1893
01:28:02.252 --> 01:28:04.298
WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE HIM
PLEAD INSANITY?


1894
01:28:04.341 --> 01:28:05.951
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

1895
01:28:05.995 --> 01:28:09.868
I MEAN, ANYONE WHO
CAN EVEN THINK
OF SUCH A THING.


1896
01:28:09.912 --> 01:28:11.783
I CAN'T MAKE HIM
DO ANYTHING.


1897
01:28:11.827 --> 01:28:14.656
I CAN EITHER
DEFEND HIM
OR WITHDRAW


1898
01:28:14.699 --> 01:28:17.267
AND PROBABLY BE
DISBARRED.


1899
01:28:17.311 --> 01:28:20.357
THEN BE DISBARRED.

1900
01:28:20.401 --> 01:28:21.706
I'D RATHER SEE YOU
BE DISBARRED


1901
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:26.232
THAN HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH LETTING
THIS MAN GO.


1902
01:28:26.276 --> 01:28:28.974
IS THAT REALLY WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO?


1903
01:28:29.018 --> 01:28:32.238
NO. WHAT GOOD
WILL THAT DO?


1904
01:28:32.282 --> 01:28:33.979
THERE WILL ONLY BE
A MISTRIAL,


1905
01:28:34.023 --> 01:28:36.373
AND HE'LL PROBABLY
GET OFF ANYWAY.


1906
01:28:36.417 --> 01:28:39.115
THEY MAY FIND HIM
GUILTY.


1907
01:28:39.158 --> 01:28:41.987
IT'S STILL VERY CLOSE.

1908
01:28:42.031 --> 01:28:44.555
AND HE MAY BE INNOCENT.

1909
01:28:44.599 --> 01:28:46.122
YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1910
01:28:46.165 --> 01:28:47.297
NO.

1911
01:28:47.341 --> 01:28:50.213
Man: JO ANN, CHARLIE'S
GETTING REALLY HOT.


1912
01:28:50.256 --> 01:28:51.127
COME ON!

1913
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:54.957
I'M COMING.
TWO MINUTES, OK?


1914
01:28:57.829 --> 01:28:58.526
I GOT TO GO.

1915
01:28:58.569 --> 01:29:01.267
I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

1916
01:29:01.311 --> 01:29:04.967
I DON'T THINK SO.

1917
01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:07.404
I THINK I--I JUST
GOT TO LET YOU DO


1918
01:29:07.448 --> 01:29:10.407
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

1919
01:29:10.451 --> 01:29:14.585
I CAN'T HELP,
AND I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THAT.


1920
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:17.066
IT SOUNDS SERIOUS.

1921
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:18.197
IT'S NOT.

1922
01:29:18.241 --> 01:29:23.725
I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S NOT SERIOUS
FOR US.


1923
01:29:23.768 --> 01:29:25.988
I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN IT'S ALL OVER.


1924
01:29:26.031 --> 01:29:27.903
MEANING YOU'RE NOT
COMING TOMORROW.


1925
01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:33.038
NO. I DON'T
THINK SO.


1926
01:29:33.082 --> 01:29:35.432
JUST PROMISE ME
ONE THING--


1927
01:29:35.476 --> 01:29:38.653
THAT YOU'LL TRY
YOUR BEST TO LET
THE TRUTH COME OUT.


1928
01:29:38.696 --> 01:29:43.658
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT, ISN'T IT?


1929
01:29:43.701 --> 01:29:47.444
IN FAIRY TALES.

1930
01:29:47.488 --> 01:29:50.447
SO MAKE THIS ONE
COME TRUE.


1931
01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:52.493
YOU CAN DO IT.

1932
01:29:54.538 --> 01:29:57.193
YOU'RE STORMY WEATHERS.

1933
01:29:58.324 --> 01:30:00.414
I'LL SEE YOU.

1934
01:30:11.076 --> 01:30:13.470
[FOOTSTEPS]

1935
01:30:13.514 --> 01:30:16.168
YEAH. HERE YOU GO,
MR. WEATHERS.


1936
01:30:16.212 --> 01:30:18.301
DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.


1937
01:30:18.344 --> 01:30:19.128
THANK YOU, SIR.

1938
01:30:19.171 --> 01:30:25.439
HEH HEH.
HEH HEH HEH!


1939
01:30:25.482 --> 01:30:29.051
NYEEEHHHH.

1940
01:30:29.094 --> 01:30:34.491
NYEEEHHHH!

1941
01:30:34.535 --> 01:30:35.884
THE VIBRATOR.

1942
01:30:35.927 --> 01:30:37.494
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

1943
01:30:37.538 --> 01:30:38.408
HA HA HA!

1944
01:30:38.452 --> 01:30:40.018
I'LL TELL YOU,
MR. WEATHERS.


1945
01:30:40.062 --> 01:30:41.150
YOU ARE GOOD.

1946
01:30:41.193 --> 01:30:42.804
YOU KNOW, I BEEN
HERE NEARLY

1947
01:30:42.847 --> 01:30:45.415
YOU'RE
THE SLIPPERIEST ONE
I EVER SEEN.


1948
01:30:45.459 --> 01:30:49.463
I MEAN, RABBITS,
MISSING BODIES,
YAK SHIT. HA!


1949
01:30:49.506 --> 01:30:50.420
YOU'RE GONNA
GET THIS GUY OFF,


1950
01:30:50.464 --> 01:30:51.682
I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW.


1951
01:30:51.726 --> 01:30:53.118
YOU GOT THIS JURY
SNOWED.


1952
01:30:53.162 --> 01:30:57.296
WELL, I'M OUT
OF HERE.
I'LL SEE YOU.


1953
01:31:01.475 --> 01:31:03.781
OH, GOD.

1954
01:31:31.287 --> 01:31:33.550
MR. WEATHERS!

1955
01:31:37.598 --> 01:31:40.992
YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

1956
01:31:43.473 --> 01:31:45.910
I'M GONNA GO
WASH UP.


1957
01:31:45.954 --> 01:31:48.173
YOU TURNED GRUEL
INTO CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.


1958
01:31:48.217 --> 01:31:49.566
YOU SHOULD BE
EXULTANT.


1959
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:50.872
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

1960
01:31:50.915 --> 01:31:56.181
I THINK I'M ABOUT
TO GET A PSYCHOTIC
ACQUITTED.


1961
01:31:56.225 --> 01:31:59.663
GO CLEAN UP
AND COME
TO MY OFFICE.


1962
01:31:59.707 --> 01:32:01.230
YES, MA'AM.

1963
01:32:01.273 --> 01:32:04.146
YOU'RE AS NAIVE
AS THE DAY YOU
WALKED IN HERE.


1964
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:06.148
THEY'RE ALMOST
ALWAYS GUILTY.


1965
01:32:06.191 --> 01:32:09.064
BUT ALMOST ALWAYS
CONVICTED.


1966
01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:10.587
BENOIT MAY WALK.

1967
01:32:10.631 --> 01:32:12.589
SO YOU'VE DONE
A GOOD JOB.


1968
01:32:12.633 --> 01:32:13.590
YOU'VE UPHELD
YOUR OATH.


1969
01:32:13.634 --> 01:32:16.550
I KNOW. THE CODE
OF LEGAL ETHICS SAY


1970
01:32:16.593 --> 01:32:18.029
THAT I MUST DO
EVERYTHING I CAN


1971
01:32:18.073 --> 01:32:20.075
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES
OF THE LAW


1972
01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:22.338
TO GET AN ACQUITTAL.

1973
01:32:22.381 --> 01:32:23.731
AND THE DILEMMA IS?

1974
01:32:23.774 --> 01:32:26.472
MY SENSE OF RIGHT
AND WRONG SAY

01:47:11.487 --> 01:47:14.577
YOU'D REALLY HAVE
LET THAT MAN
WALK THE STREET?


2281
01:47:14.621 --> 01:47:16.797
I'M A LAWYER!

2282
01:47:18.102 --> 01:47:19.147
ROBIN, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.


2283
01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:22.237
ANYTHING ELSE
WOULD HAVE BEEN
WRONG.


2284
01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.630
I HOPE SO.

2285
01:47:23.673 --> 01:47:25.588
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
AS MY LAWYER,
YOU UNDERSTAND.


2286
01:47:25.632 --> 01:47:29.157
HA HA HA!

2287
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:31.420
HMM.

2288
01:47:52.963 --> 01:47:55.444
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

2289
01:47:55.488 --> 01:47:59.274
I DON'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.


2290
01:47:59.796 --> 01:48:03.887
WE'RE SUING
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.


2291
01:48:03.931 --> 01:48:05.541
WELL, IT'S A CLASS ACTION
ON BEHALF OF BRIGITTE


2292
01:48:05.585 --> 01:48:09.284
AND ALL THE KIDS
AT THE SUNSHINE SCHOOL.


2293
01:48:09.327 --> 01:48:10.938
THEY GOT RIGHTS.

2294
01:48:10.981 --> 01:48:12.505
BUT THE PRESIDENT...

2295
01:48:12.548 --> 01:48:14.724
AND THE U.S. CONGRESS.

2296
01:48:14.768 --> 01:48:17.292
I DON'T MESS AROUND.

2297
01:48:18.075 --> 01:48:20.121
I'M GONNA CRY.

2298
01:48:20.164 --> 01:48:21.252
YOU ARE CRYING.

2299
01:48:21.296 --> 01:48:23.428
NO, I'M NOT.

2300
01:48:23.472 --> 01:48:25.779
LOOK. YOU SAID
YOU NEEDED A GOOD LAWYER.


2301
01:48:25.822 --> 01:48:30.435
WELL, YOU GOT
AN EX-HOTSHOT
CRIMINAL ATTORNEY,


2302
01:48:30.479 --> 01:48:34.309
FRESH OUT OF
THE LIMELIGHT.


2303
01:48:35.615 --> 01:48:37.355
ROBIN...

2304
01:48:37.399 --> 01:48:39.532
YEAH, I KNOW.

2305
01:48:39.575 --> 01:48:41.664
I'M A HELL OF A GUY.
