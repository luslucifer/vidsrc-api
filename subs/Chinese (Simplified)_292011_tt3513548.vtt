I didn't mean to be rude. I wasn't raised like that.


24
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.720
你每句话都要以"我"这个字开头吗?

33
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.040
里面有胶带和一盒新笔

34
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.770
我发现您的东西不够了

我猜你喜欢吃

40
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.270
因为我看到你垃圾桶里有它的包装袋

49
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.730

先生 因为我想保护人民安全

72
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.500
-嗯哼?  - 你用单手打过没?
- Yeah? - You ever do it with one hand?


73
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.770
布莱恩特先生?

74
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.340

When you get your badge and I can see that day's coming,


99
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.390

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.050
"你是想让我用一只脚平衡啤酒瓶吗?"
"You want me to balance a tricking beer on my foot?"


112
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.250

God, you dumbass.


113

Wait.


115
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.620

116
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.920
是那个保安
It's that rent-a-cop.


117
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.990
妈的
Shit.


118
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.930

Open the door.


119
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.770
有何事 警官?

120
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.440
有人投诉噪音 所以来看看怎么回事
I heard a little noise complaint. Thought I'd come take a look around.


121
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.550
你得先有搜查令
You're gonna need a search warrant first.


122
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.550
小鬼 把你的手拿开
Son, you're gonna have to take your hands off me.


123
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.840
我只是随便看看
I'm just taking a little look-see.


124
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.710
首先 你根本就不是一个真警察
You're not even a real cop, first of all,


125
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.240
而且你没有搜查令 无权查房
and you're not allowed to search a room without a warrant.


126
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.650
-小鬼!  - 我们付租金的
- Boy! - We pay rent. We pay rent.


127
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.820
这是我们的住所 懂吗
It's like we live here, man.


128
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.050
这是我的工作
Boy, this is my job.


129
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.860
你必须得让我做我的工作
I'm gonna have to have you let me do my job.


130
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.730
-但这是我们的房间  -没错
- And this is our room. - Yeah.


131
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.320
你懂不懂什么叫非法搜查和查封
Are you aware of the notion of unlawful search and seizure?


132
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.960
混蛋 你可不能就这么大摇大摆走进来
Asshole, you're not supposed to just walk in here.


133
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.830
你继续说 考验我
Keep pushing me. Keep testing me.


134
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.630
-到时候有你好看  -是吗？
- See if you like where it gets you. - Yeah?


135
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.430
你没事吧?
You all right?


136
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.880
新生入学周我怎么说的?
What did I say freshman orientation week?


137
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.780
我说“校园里禁止喝酒”
I said, "No drinking on my campus.“


138
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.180
我不知道为啥没人让我注意到你之前的履历
I don't know why no one called my attention to your file before.


139
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.590
你看看 都是对你的投诉
I mean, all these complaints about you.


140
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.660
殴打学生
Physically assaulting a student.


141
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.030
还有 你真的在高速上把人拦截下吗?
And have you really been pulling people over on the highway?


142
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.430
呃 是的 先生 我有过
Um, yes, sir, I have.


143
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.440
我认为如果你在路上做酒精测试
I figured that if you do the drunk tests on the road,


144
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.570
校园里就不会发生事端
trouble never gets to the campus.


145
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.940
我们无权管辖高速公路
We don't have any jurisdiction on the highway.


146
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.380
我知道
And I realize that,


147
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.910
先生 但是我坚守法律与秩序
but I believe in law and order, sir.


148
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.180
-这是一国之本  - 嗯
- You can't have a country without it - Mmm.


149
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.720
你被哈伯沙姆县治安办公室开除了
And you were dismissed from the Habersham County Sheriffs Office.


150
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.820
“我不想在校园里出现违法乱纪的事”
"I don't want any Mickey-Mousing on these grounds."


151
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.530
这难道不是你说过的话?
Isn't that what you said?


152
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.160
我什么时候说过?
When did I say that?


153
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.790
我想你是在去年校庆日上说的
You said it at Founders' Day last year, I believe.


154
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.840
你正在喝酒 我朝你走过去
You were by the punch bowl. I walked up to you,


155
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.670
然后你和我说 额...
and you said to me, uh...


156
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.740
好吧 我打断了你
Well, I had interrupted you.


157
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.500
对此我向您道歉 我向您介绍了自己
I apologized, I introduced myself


158
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.310
然后我说 我将会是你雇佣过的最好的校园保安
and I said I was gonna be the greatest campus security guard you ever had.


159
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.580
然后你说 “不错
And you said, "That's good.


160
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.580
我可不想在这个校园里看到任何违法乱纪的事儿 ”
I don't want any Mickey-Mousing on this campus.


161
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.890
我想我应该还把它写下来了
I think I mighfve even wrote it down.


162
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.920
大部分事情我都会记录
I write down most things.


163
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.570
我会记下重点 应该在…
Try to keep the important one, and I believe…


164
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.410
在这 “我不想在这个校园里看到任何违法乱纪的事儿” 
Oh yes, sir. “I don’t wanna any Micky-Mousing on this ground.”


165
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.010
这话是你说的 我只是秉公照办
Those are your words, sir, so… I took it seriously.


166
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.380
所以我想问问 你要如何处置宿舍的那些学生
And my question for you is, what about these kids in the dormitory?


167
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.550
喝酒等违纪行为 你要作何打算
Drink and all that. What are you gonna do about that?


168
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.810
要对他们进行严惩吗
We’re just going to let them slam?


169
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.710
你是主动辞职 还是我来开除你？
Do you wanna resign? Or would it be better if I fired you?


170
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.350
我被叫进办公室 还以为会有好事呢
So, I’m going into this guy’s office, and I think he’s bringing me into this.


171
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.210
我还以为他要嘉奖我或者给我升职
He’s gonna… you know, give me some commendation or promotion or something.


172
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.160
没想到他叫我去就是为了开除我
Don’t know to found out he brought me in there to fire me.


173
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.110
你敢信？
Can you believe that?


174
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.860
那本来就是个烂工作
Well, it’s a shit job anyway .


175
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.110
只有一群校园小鬼
college brats.


176
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.360
那么你接下来几个月又要在别处做安保工作？
So, you’ll just gonna be somewhere do security work next couple months?


177
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.710
我很尽职尽责的 只是那群孩子很难对付
I worked hard at that job. Those kids are just ran and won.


178
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.910
奥运会快到了 兄弟 你可以去保卫世界
Olympics is coming, brother. You can police the whole damn world.


179
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.010
庆典将在世纪公园举行
Celebration is at the Centennial Park.


180
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.810
这破城市终于有点重头戏了
Something finally happens in this stupid city.


181
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.520
我还要去听肯尼·罗杰斯的演唱会
and I get a fucking Kenny Rogers concert.


182
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.930
这就不错啦 还可能是马术呢
It could be worse. Could be equestrian.


183
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.130
-我得去隆胸了 -隆胸在这儿可没啥用
- I'm getting my tits done. - I don't see how that applies here.


184
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.610
明年这个时候 我们就都得在电视上抢工作了
This time next year, we're all gonna be scrambling for jobs on TV.


185
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.240
隆到D杯你觉得怎么样？
What do you think, D cup?


186
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.170
我会想你的 凯西 但我不觉得他们也会
I'd miss you, Kathy, but I don't think they would.


187
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.650
各位女士 我很抱歉我报道的混蛋杀人犯们
Ladies, I'm sorry my hot-ass murders


188
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.880
让你们写的那些无聊的屁话下了头版
keep knocking your boring bullshit off the front page.


189
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.850
我太抱歉了
I'm so sorry.


190
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.050
你想喝一杯吗
You wanna get a drink?


191
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.420
不了 我会拖你后腿的
I'd just slow you down.


192
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.050
随你便
Suit yourself.


193
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.490
行吧 如果你觉得这样最好的话
Yeah, if you think that's the best thing.


194

199
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.180
我们的墨粉和复印纸都没了
We're out of toner and copy paper.


200
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.860

201
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.150

There's a sale at the mall. It's 10% off


205
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.730

No, it's gonna be wonderful for CNN,


210
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.410
对可口可乐公司和有停车位的人来说 都是好事儿
Coca-Cola, and anybody with a parking lot.


211
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.990

如果我在奥运会这个工作表现的好 说不定又能当上警察
I do this Olympics gig well, maybe someone might make me a cop again.


214
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.870

Hey, I might not move out until after you've had your surgery.

We got plenty of time to tend to that after the games are over.


221
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.380

224

The opening of the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta,


239
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.780

On a warm summer's eve On a train bound for nowhere

无聊侵袭 他开始讲话
The boredom overtook us And he began to speak

当你赌完的时候

真是个噩梦
Fucking nightmare.


268
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.600
知道哪儿有什么违法犯罪的事儿吗？
Isn't there anything crime-y going on anywhere?


269
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.040
我上哪儿知道去？我在这儿
How would I know? I'm here.


270
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.210
天啊

271
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.810
想跳舞吗？
You wanna dance?


272
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.150
我倒是想 但我正在上班
I'd love to, but I am on duty.

Oh, fuck duty. Come on.


274

没事儿的
Might as well.


275
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.580
打扰了 女士
Excuse me, ma'am.


276

-你需要水吗？ -嗯？

277
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.130
唔 水 今晚很热
Uh, water. It's a warm night


278
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.560
你就在这儿把水给出去吗？
Are you just giving them away?


279
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.030
是啊 我把水放在这里给警察们喝
Yeah, I keep them in here for police officers,


280
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.160
或者给怀孕的女士
or when I see a pregnant woman,


281
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.000
-是啊
-Yeah.


282
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.870
-祝你有个愉快的晚上  -你也是

283
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.230
好的
All right.


284
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:22.410
你得知道 什么时候坚持 什么时候放弃
You got to know when to hold 'em Know when to fold 'em


285
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.750
什么时候一走了之 什么时候逃之夭夭
Know when to walk away And know when to run


286
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.020
借过 抱歉
Excuse me, sorry.


287
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.490
这些运动员们都在抱怨
You got all these athletes complaining about


288
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.360
交通不好让他们迟到
getting to the venues late on account of the traffic.


289
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.860
但警察呢？我们不也哪儿都去不了吗
But what about the cops? We can't get anywhere, either.


290
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.560
昨晚我都想鸣笛了
I had half a mind to run my siren last night


291
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.800
就为了去趟超市
just to get to the supermarket.


292
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.340
-是啊 -太他妈挤了
- Mmm-hmm. - So damn crowded.


293
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.000
城市规划太差劲了
It's just poor planning by the city.


294
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.940
没一个人知道交通规划应该怎么办
There ain't a one of them jake-legs got a damn clue about traffic patterns.


295
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.500
-是啊 -你怎么想 理查德？
- Yeah. - What do you think, Richard?


296
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.080
觉不觉得市政府里全是没用的废物？
Think the city's a bunch of jake-legs?


297
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.180
我不知道 我觉得 你也知道
I don't know. I think, you know,


298
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.220
想要调节好这一切很难
it's hard coordinating all this and MARTA and all that


299
00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.840
我很高兴我不用做这个
I'm glad I don't have to do it.


300
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:00.940
得了吧
Come on.


301
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.610
怎么了？
What?


302
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.920
很难的 做这些后勤工作
It's tough, doing all the logistics


303
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.980
还得确保一切都井井有条
and getting everything right.


304
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.090
看见那个梳马尾辫的男的了吗？
You see that guy over there with the ponytail?


305
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.330
你不觉得他的背包可疑吗？
Does his backpack look funny to you?


306
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.910
怎么可疑？
Funny how?


307
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.230
我现在看不见他了 我一会回来 各位
Now, I'm losing him now. I'll be back, guys.


308
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.520
打扰一下 先生？
Excuse me, sir?


309
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.900
嘿 哥们儿 来罐可乐

312
00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:01.170

313
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.180
棒！
Yes!


314
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.100
天啊
Jesus Christ.


315
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.870
你忘记转身了
You forgot the turn.


316
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.750
-行啦 这么严肃干嘛啊 兄弟？ -这他妈什么啊？
- come on, why so grim, big guy? - What the fuck is this?


317
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.320
-因为我觉得无聊 这很无聊 -我们都无聊
- Because I'm bored. It's boring. - We're all bored.


318
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.980
他们可不无聊
These guys aren't bored.


319
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.380
这舞蹈可真不是开玩笑啊 哈？
This dance is a real thing, huh?


320
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.190
我只是觉得我这样的人应该做比这更好的事儿 知道吗？
I just feel like I was made for something better, you know, than this?


321
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.960
是吗 你觉得我不是？
Yeah, you think I wasn't?


322
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.520
为了有更多时间去思考
To have a little more time to reflect


323
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.670
我现在在写一本书 不是关于我自己的
I'm writing a book right now, not about myself...


324
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.180
天啊 他的确挺帅的
My, my, he sure is handsome.


325
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.690
你确定不要三明治或者其它东西？
You sure you don't want a sandwich or anything?


326
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.230
不 妈妈 我觉得肚子不太舒服
No, Mama, I'm not feeling well. It's my stomach.


327
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.020
是吃什么吃坏了么？
Something you ate?


328
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.830
是吧 我猜是
Yeah, I guess so.


329
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.260
我一整个早晨都在厕所
I was in the bathroom all morning


330
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.300
你为什么要吃垃圾快餐食品？
Why you eat that fast food junk?


331
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.340
怎么了 理查德？
What is wrong, Richard?


332
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.650
我只是看着这个地方觉得
I just look around this place and I just think


333
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.780
这个世界欠你一个更好的  妈妈
the world owes you better than this, Mama.


334
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.560
这个世界欠咱们俩的
Shoot, the world owes us both.


335
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.390
但我们的生活就是这样
This is what we got


336

这可能是件好事
This could be a good thing.


346
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.730
这怎么能是件好事呢？
How's this a good thing?


347

我们可以带你去跳水馆
We could bring you out to the diving venue.


348
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.800
让你“放”出一首国歌
We could have you fart the national anthem,


349
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.670
别让我现在笑
Do not make me laugh right now.


350
00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.940
你怎么不跟别人换班?然后回家

The police, they're not gonna ask you as nicely.

他们一看到酒鬼和混乱
They see the drunk and disorderly,

棒
Nice.


396
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.030
谁留下的这个怪东西？

It's heavy.


399
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.230
我觉得我们应该把它拿走

借过
Excuse me.


402
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.540
同志们 我看到一群酒鬼用酒瓶子砸塔
Hey, guys. We got some drunk guys breaking bottles against the tower.


403
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.910
他们不听我的
They're not listening to me.


404
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.640
可能他们会听你们的
Maybe they'll listen to you.


405
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.640
人们尊重警察
People respect the badge.


406
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.980
我觉得我们应该把它带到蓝调之屋
I think we should take it down to the House of Blues


407
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.280
看看能卖多少钱
and see how much we can get for it


408
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.320
好主意
That's a clutch idea.


409
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.790
嘿！离开这！快走！离它远点
Hey! Get away from there. Go on! Get off it.


410
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.320
你们在干什么？
What you all doing?


411
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.550
快走 离开这！
Go on, get outta here!


412
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.090
-嘿 各位 问问... -快走 回家找妈妈去
- Hey, you guys. See if... - Go on. Run home to Mommy.


413
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.600
嘿 问问他们有没有在椅子下面落一个包
Hey, see if they left a backpack under my bench.


414
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.930
亚特兰大911
Atlanta 911.


415
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.930
你能听到么？
Can you understand me?


416
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.000
可以 请讲
Yes, Go ahead.


417
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.610
你们违抗自卫队的命令
You defy the order of the militia


418
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.510
什么？
What?


419
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.180
我又接到了一个奇怪的电话
I got another weird one.


420
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.740
这不是他们的 理查德
Well, it ain't theirs, Richard.


421
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.180
我不喜欢这东西
I don't like this.


422
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:48.220
我们发现了一个可疑包裹 我们最好上报
We got ourselves a suspicious package. We better call it in.


423
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.190
可能只是某个醉鬼把它落在这了
Probably just somebody run off drunk and forgot they left it.


424
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.390
我仍然觉得我们该上报
I still think we ought to call it in.


425
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.230
把它带到失物招领处吧 理查德
Just take it to lost and found, Richard.


426
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.130
我们是不是该先看看里面有什么？
Shouldn't we unzip it, and see what's inside first?


427
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.260
不不 你不能碰它
No, no, you don't wanna touch that.


428
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.030
你得遵守规则
You got to follow protocol.


429
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.110
这个混蛋非得把它落在你的长椅下 是不是？
Son of a bitch had to get left under your bench, didn't it?


430
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.610
我们发现一个无人认领的背包 请求帮助-
We need assistance on an unclaimed bag-


431
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.150
一个可疑的背包

432
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.980
一个在四区的可疑背包
A suspicious package over at section four.


433
00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.590
我们还应该围一个环形边界
We ought to set up some kind of a perimeter, too.


434
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.680
-让人们后退  -环形边界？
- Just back away. - Perimeter?


435
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.020
理查德 你疯了么？
Richard, you crazy?


436
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.360
你知道么？我现在宁可疯了也不想出错
You know what? I would rather be crazy than wrong right now.


437
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.860
该死的 理查德 这只是一包啤酒
Shit, Richard. It's just full of beer.


438
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.330

441
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.770
同志们 楼下有情况

442
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.280
我们得带你们离开这
We're gonna have to get you outta here.


443
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.510
什么情况？
What kind of situation?


444
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.510
我们正在观察塔前的一个可疑包裹
Well, we're looking at a suspicious package in front of the tower.


445
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.810
已通知执法机关 他们正在现场
Law enforcement is aware and they're on the scene.


446
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.750
如果警察告诉我们得离开 我们就走
Well, if the cops tell us we gotta go, we'll go.


447
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.260
乐队在舞台中间 我们不能直接喊停
The band's in the middle of a set. We can't just shut down.


448
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.810

伙计们
Hey, guys.


451
00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.360
我们发现塔前有一个炸弹
We got a bomb scare in front of the tower.


452
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.530
你们应该知道
You should be aware of that.


453
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.570
华盛顿一直有炸弹威胁 但从来都没出过事儿
We get bomb threats all the time in DC. They're never anything.


454
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.400

458

459
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.010

All right, I'm gonna go find a lighter. I'll be back.


466
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.030
抽烟会要了你的命的
Those'll kill ya.


467
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.040
怎么死不是死啊

西尔弗 里面还有11个人

577
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.890
A队 发生一起爆炸
A Team, there was an explosion.


578
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.760
派尽可能多的救护车过来

你上司同意了

我得告诉你 有一大批人帮着疏散人员
I gotta tell ya, there were a whole bunch of folks clearing people out.


611
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.930
警方 医护人员 不止是我
Police personnel, medics. It wasn't just me.

619
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.020
并在其爆炸前疏散群众的安保人员

I was a person that did the job that I was supposed to do.


624

我刚好在对的时间和对的地点

并且运用了我在训练中学到的东西
and used my training in the way I was taught

The real heroes are the paramedics and the firemen,


627

所有把自己置于炸弹

628
00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.770
和不愿移动的人们之间的警员们
between the bomb and the people that were refusing to move


629
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.370
因为他们承受了绝大多数的弹片
because they took most of the shrapnel themselves.


630
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.610
做的好 雷达

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.150
我都需要一个秘书了
I need a secretary.


670
00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.480
是的 我想我也需要一个秘书
Yeah, I think I might need a secretary, too.


671
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.610
有个从纽约来的人还问我想不想出书
Some guy from New York just asked me if I wanna write a book.


672
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.420
得了别开玩笑啦
You don't mean it


673
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.120
不 我没有开玩笑
No, I'm not kidding you.


674
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.730
他们告诉我 显然...
They tell me, apparently...


675
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.090
噢 天啊
Oh, Lord.


676
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.030
显然 他们找到了完全符合书中形象的人
Apparently, they got somebody who they think up all the stuff in the book,


677
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.190
他们把东西打印出来然后问你
they type it out and then they just ask you,


678
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.100
“是或否,” "真或假," "它真的发生了吗？" 然后他们付钱给你
"yes or no," "true or false,“ "did it happen?" Then they pay you.


679
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.500
这么做是为了挣钱
You do that for money.


680
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.270
噢 天啊 你就像个摇滚明星
Oh, my God, you're a rock star.


681
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.610
连汤姆·布罗考都在说你的事儿
Tom Brokaw was even talking about you.


682
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.670
我现在都不会思考了
I can't even think right now.


683
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.980
你还好吗？你一直都没睡
Are you all right? You've been up for so long.


684
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.380
-噢 天啊 太糟糕了 -妈妈 抱歉 我都没有拥抱你
- Oh, my God, it was so horrible. - Mama, I'm sorry. I didn't even hug you.


685
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:38.220
-这太糟糕了 糟糕 -我知道 我就在现场
- It was so awful. Awful. - I know, I was there.


686
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.120
噢 天呐
Oh, my God.


687
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.490
谢天谢地你没在那
Be thankful that you weren't there.


688
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.430
-你本打算去那儿的  -我知道
- You could have been there. - I know.


689
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.230
-我控制不了 -是啊
- I couldn't have handled that. - No.


690
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.460
两天前你去那儿看肯尼·罗杰斯
You were there two nights ago for Kenny Rogers.


691
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:49.700
幸好你昨晚没在那儿
Can you imagine if you were there last night?


692
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.600
我知道 我知道 坐下吧 先坐下
I know. I know. Sit down. Sit down.


693
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.400
你一定很饿 我去给你弄点吃的
You must be really hungry. I'm gonna give you some food.


694
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.610
噢 上帝啊
Oh, my goodness.


695
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.170
噢 妈妈 我跟你说...
Oh, Mama, I'm telling you what...


696
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.640
现场一片混乱 妈妈
It was complete chaos, Mama.


697
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.610
一想到我原本可能请病假
And to think I could've called in sick.


698
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.810
还记得我昨天有多难受吗
Think about how I was feeling yesterday.


699
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.010
-我知道 -我原本可能请病假的
- I know. - I could've called in sick.


700
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.390
我知道
I know.


701
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.460
-然后会发生什么？ -噢 天啊
- Then what? - Oh, my Lord.


702
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.050
肖恩
Shaw.


703
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.860
-不 我得挂了 -你还好吗？
- No, I gotta go. - Doing okay?


704
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:20.660
不
No.


705
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.110
那枚炸弹在我眼皮底下爆炸了
That bomb went off on my watch.


706
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.870
那是我负责的公园
That's my fucking park.


707
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.810
我们没有足够的警卫监管 是我们的责任
We didn't have enough eyeballs there. That's on us.


708
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.470
让我们抓住那个狗娘养的 好吗？
Let's just catch the son of a bitch, yeah?


709
00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.010
好的
Yeah.


710
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.470
我需要你到哈伯沙姆县去
I need you to get out to Habersham County.


711
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.140
这是前副警长的背景
Background on a former sheriffs deputy.


712
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.880
也许和爆炸有关
Might have some connection to the bombing.


713
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.380
是谁？
Who is it?


714
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.710
那个保安
The security guard.


715
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.490
嘿 理查德！
Hey, Richard!


716
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.840
嘿 干得好 伙计
Hey, way to go, man.


717
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.340
我们都为你感到骄傲
You made us all real proud.


718
00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:07.400
谢谢你
Thank you.


719
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.620
克莱尔博士 谢谢你联系联邦调查局
Dr. Cleere, we wanna thank you for contacting the FBI


720
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:19.060
提出你对理查德·朱维尔的怀疑
regarding your suspicions about Richard Jewell.


721
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.850
我想说清楚 我没有指控他任何事
I want to be clear, I haven't accused him of anything.


722
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.390
我们完全理解
We completely understand.


723
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.000
我只是...
I just...


724
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.770
我看到他获得的关注了
I see the attention he's getting.


725
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.430
这是他在这一直寻求的那种关注
It's the kind of attention he was always seeking here.


726
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.440
骚扰学生 在高速公路拦车
Harassing students, pulling people over on the highway.


727
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.480
都是疯狂的行为
Just crazy behavior.


728
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.740
我想如果我的疑虑无误
And I decided if my fears were correct,


729
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:44.050
如果他不是人们所认为的英雄
if he actually wasn't the hero they're making him out to be,


730
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.190
而我有与事实相关的信息
and I had information pertinent to the fact,


731
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.580
却没能公诸于众
which I failed to bring to light,


732
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.390
这可能会危及生命
it could jeopardize lives.


733
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.160
好吧 克莱尔博士 你打电话给我们是对的
Well, Dr. Cleere, you did the right thing in calling us.


734
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.320
请放心 我们会跟进这条线索的
We will, rest assured, follow up on this.


735
00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.130
你介意我们带走这个文件夹吗？
Do you mind if we take this folder with us?


736
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.030
没问题
Please.


737
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.290
我们将复印一份 然后把原件还给你
We'll make a copy and get you the original back.


738
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.590
为什么该死的ACOG要重新开放那个公园？
Why is the goddamn ACOG reopening that park?


739
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.170
我们什么都没查着！
We don't have shit!


740
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.800
好了 我想知道更多关于朱维尔的事
Okay, I wanna hear more about Jewell.


741
00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.110
帕特里克？
Patrick?


742
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:15.810
没问题
All right.


743
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.280
好吧 当我看到朱维尔这个案子
Well, when I look at Jewell,


744
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.250
我就想到了84年洛杉矶奥运会上的炸弹恐慌案
I think about the bomb scare at the LA Olympics in '84.


745
00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.820
把袋子留在公交车上的和发现它的是同一个警察
A bag left on a bus by the same cop who then discovered it


746
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.350
还有今年夏天爱达荷州的火灾
And the fires in Idaho this summer


747
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.330
是一名想要得到扑灭大火荣誉的消防员纵的火
started by a firefighter who wanted the credit for putting them out.


748
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.430
这是一种犯罪侧写
A profile emerges here.


749
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.600
虚假英雄
The false hero.


750
00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.100
在采访中 朱维尔对爆炸事件的描述含糊不清
In interviews, Jewell's account of the bombing seems vague


751
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.280
他在讨论受害者的时候看起来很不自在
and he looks uncomfortable discussing the victims.


752
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.280
我还发现他在电视上提到
I also found that his mentioning on TV


753
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:50.310
说他想回到执法部门 这有点不合时宜
that he wanted to get back into law enforcement a bit inappropriate.


754
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.380
这有很多问题
There's a lot here that's troubli


755
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.940
肖恩探员了解的一切信息
And everything that Agent Shaw has learned about him


756
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.490
都同步在这个档案里了
syncs up with this profile.


757
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.990
你也是这么想的吗 汤姆？
You agree with that, Tom?


758
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.990
是的 长官 我是
Yes, sir, I do.


759
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.360
我们需要监视他
Let's put eyes on him.


760
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.570
-沃森  -怎么了？
- Watson? - Yeah?


761
00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.400
-沃森  -在
- Watson? -Yeah.


762
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.010
一号线有电话找你
you have called on line one.


763
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.010
是不是比尔盖茨问我是否需要一百万美元
is it Bill Gates randomly wondering if I need a million dollars so that's an affirmative


764
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.740
如果是的话 答案肯定的
If so, that's an affirmative.


765
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.010
是理查德·朱维尔
It's Richard Jewell.


766
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.580
那个大英雄理查德·朱维尔？
"Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell?


767
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.710
就是大英雄理查德·朱维尔 他在一号线
"Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell, line one.


768
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:35.720
你好？
Hello?


769
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.690
布莱恩特先生
Mr. Bryant


770
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.360
嘿 抱歉打扰你
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.


771
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.830
我刚从信息中心拿到你的号码
I just got your number from Information.


772
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.100
希望你还记得我
I hope you remember me.


773
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.000
雷达 叫我沃森 你现在可是全国的英雄
Radar, you can call me Watson. You're a national hero now.


774
00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.370
很高兴你打电话来 我们已经没有士力架了
I'm glad you called. We're running out of Snickers,


775
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.710
谢谢你 先生 你还好吗？家里怎么样？
Thank you, sir. How are you? How's your family?


776
00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.370
我们都很好 是的 是的
we're all fine, yeah, yeah.


777
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.920
我看你已经不玩儿电子游戏了
I see you've moved up from video games.


778
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.610
是的 对 不是有意为之 但我想是的
Yep. Yeah, I didn't mean to, but I guess I did.


779
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.420
干得好 那是件值得骄傲的事情 我能为你做点什么吗？
Good job. That's a prideful thing. What can I... What can I do you for?


780
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.060
先生 我打电话给你
Sir, I was calling you


781
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.630
因为我想知道 你办过出书协议的合同吗？
because I wanted to know, have you ever done a book deal?


782
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.530
什么 额...为什么问这个？
What, uh... Why?


783
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.400
因为这个爆炸事件 来了一些纽约的家伙
With this whole bomb thing, I got these New York guys


784
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.200
他们想让我写本书
who are asking me to write a book


785
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:22.710
但我对那一无所知
and I don't really know anything about that.


786
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.370
所以我想打给你 也许你能帮我
So I thought maybe I could call you, you might be able to help me.


787
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.640
当然 听起来和我的专长有点扯不上边
Sure, Sounds a little far-fetched,


788
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.250
但是合同就是合同 但 是的 我们可以谈谈
but contracts are contracts, but, yeah, we could talk.


789
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.550
所以 你不在美国小企业管理局工作了吗？
So, are you not the US Small Business Admin anymore?


790
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.090
因为我最开始试过给那打电话
'Cause I tried there first


791
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.620
没有 我不干了
No, I moved on.


792
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.020
噢 怎么会这样？
Oh. How come?


793
00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.820
换种生活方式而已
Lifestyle decision.


794
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.890
你的电话号码是多少?
What's your phone number?


795
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.490
我的电话号码是404…
My phone number is 404...


796
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:47.400
404...

797
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.760
-194… -194…
- 194... - 194...


798
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.230
-8188  -8188
- 8188. - 8188.


799
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.810
好的  对了  你先不要签任何东西
All right, well, you just don't sign anything


800
00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.440
直到我先看到它  我们就从这儿开始谈
until I see it first. We'll start there.


801
00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:58.670
好的  先生
Yes, sir.


802
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.940
好的  我不会在任何纸上签字的  我会等你看过
Yeah, I won't put a pen to the page. I'll wait on it.


803
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.270
嘿  谢谢你  先生  多谢你抽出时间帮我
Hey, and thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.


804
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.440
客气什么
You got it


805
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.750
好的 再见
All right, bye.


806
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.150
-保持联系  -好的 先生
- Stay in touch. - Yes, sir.


807
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.790
-好的  -再见
- Okay. - Bye.


808
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.260
不 别这样
No, no.


809
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.990
别这么兴奋
Don't get too excited.


810
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:22.830
-别这样 -不
- No. - Yes.


811
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.400
不  冷静下来  亲爱的
No. Simmer down there, hot sauce.


812
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.130
比尔·米勒
Well, Bill Miller.


813
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.710
很高兴见到你  好久没见面了
It's nice to see you. It's been a while.


814
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.350
很高兴见到你 波比
It's nice to see you, Bobi.


815
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.540
我们的英雄在哪？
Where's the hero?


816
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.940
哦  他在家  快请进
Oh, he's in here. Come on in.


817
00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.260
你觉得炸药量有多少？
What kind of charge you figure it was?


818
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.160
嗯…
Mmm.


819
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.860
我不确定那家伙用的是什么样的炸药
I'm not sure what kind of explosive the guy used.


820
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.830
它可能是黑火药  火柴头里的强力氧化剂
It could have been black powder, match heads,


821
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.460
也许是一些包裹着图钉的氯酸盐之类的
maybe some kind of chlorate packed with nails.


822
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:04.200
你知道吗  有意思的是 那包炸弹本应向外喷射爆炸  对吗？
You know, the funny thing is the package was supposed to blow out, right?


823
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.680
所以  当那些酒鬼  就那些孩子把背包踢翻
So, when those drunks, those kids knocked it over,


824
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:09.640
他们救了不少人
they saved a bunch of lives.


825
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.550
因为炸弹本该向人群中爆炸 达到最大伤亡
Because it was supposed to blow out into a crowd for maximum casualties.


826
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.380
但是当孩子们把它踢倒 它就向上爆炸了
But when they knocked it on its back, it blew upward.


827
00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.750
大部分炸药炸向了天空
Most of the ordnance going up into the sky.


828
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:22.160
它是向“上”炸的
It blew up.


829
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.920
所以  总之  你应该找的是某种电池
So, all in all, what you're looking at is some kind of battery,


830
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.430
加上某种计时器  像一个简易的表
and some kind of timing device, like a simple clock.


831
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.070
也许像我手上带的这种腕表
Maybe a wristwatch like I'm wearing.


832
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.600
这取决布置炸弹的人有怎样的技术水平
Depends how high-tech the guy got.


833
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.430
有一些人  特别是一些退役军人
Some of these guys, especially if they're ex-military


834
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.840
或者一些大学的天才
or they're some kind of whiz out of some university,


835
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:44.070
他们就会用不同炸药进行组合的策略
they're gonna use a combination of different bomb tactics.


836
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.910
其他人就会按照这个做 就像是菜谱一样
Other people are following it like a recipe.


837
00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.020
-为了研究炸药他们可能会炸掉一根手指 -是的
- They're probably losing a finger to it - Yeah.


838
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:54.680
但是也要取决于你讨论的罪犯是谁和制作炸药的是谁
But depends on who you're talking about and who's making the bomb.


839
00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.920
嗯…
Well...


840
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.530
我很高兴了解你对这件事的看法
I like getting your opinion on it,


841
00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.900
我也确信你对它研究了很多
and I'm sure you've studied it quite a bit.


842
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.760
-谁又知道呢？ -是啊
- Who knows? - Mmm-hmm.


843
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.900
对于那些布置炸弹的人  事情也是如此啊
That's the thing, too, about these bombers.


844
00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.700
放炸弹的可能就是你或我
It could have been you or me.


845
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.130
他们那些人  有一些看起来就像普通人
These guys, some of them, look like regular people.


846
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.780
他们中很多都是如此
Lot of them do.


847
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.440
没错
Yeah.


848
00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.170
你们压力一定很大吧
Must be a lot of pressure on you guys.


849
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.140
和平常差不多
No more so than usual.


850
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.970
当然  不过是又一起… 谢谢你
Sure, just another... Thank you.


851
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:51.770
不过是奥运期间美国碰到的又一起平常的致命炸弹袭击
Just your average deadly bombing on US soil during the Olympics.


852
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.180
没什么大不了的
No big deal.


853
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.990
不知道  你们媒体肯定感受到了这件事的热度  对吗？
I don't know, you guys must be feeling the heat, too, huh?


854
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:57.890
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.


855
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.350
美国有线电视网一定会尽全力报道这件事
CNN is going wall-to-wall with this.


856
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.090
这就是我们为什么来这
Is that why we get this


857
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.420
的原因？
outfit?


858
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.830
所以  给我点儿能报道的消息
So, then give me something I can print.


859
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.100
凯西 你知道我不能这样做
Kathy, you know I can't do that.


860
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.640
没关系  我已经知道你们在调查某人
That's all right. I already know the Bureau's looking into somebody.


861
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.440
很好  是什么让你这么想？
Yeah, what makes you think that?


862
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.300
是朋友
Friends.


863
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.500
-朋友? -线人
- Friends? - Sources.


864
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.700
线人?
Sources?


865
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:23.950
你们调查的到底是谁？
Who is it?


866
00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.880
凯西 如果你不能从他们嘴里套到消息
Well, Kathy, if you couldn't fuck it out of them,


867
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.050
你凭什么认为从我这儿能套到
what makes you think you're gonna fuck it outta me?


868
00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.460
你知道什么让我烦恼吗  凯茜 那就是人们不了解
You know what bothers me, Kathy, is that people don't understand


869
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.430
我们需要花多大的功夫在这样的案子里
how much work goes into making a case like this.


870
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.660
那简直是不眠不休
It's effort 24/7.


871
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.260
嗯
Hmm.


872
00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.030
你说得对
You're right


873
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:49.800
要不要和我说说？
Why don't you educate me?


874
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.570
我不会让别人把它搞砸的
I will not have this screwed up.


875
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.040
外面已经发生过一次屠杀了
That was a massacre out there.


876
00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.580
没有更多的人被杀简直是奇迹
It's a miracle more people weren't killed.


877
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:59.050
我绝不会报道
I would never go to print


878
00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.850
如果没有来自第二方的证实
without independent corroboration from a second source.


879
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.980
而且那会让我们进入一个十分不同的阶段
And that would put us in a very different zone.


880
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.660
你懂的
As you know.


881
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.090
真的?
Really?


882
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.220
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.


883
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:15.260
是什么样的阶段？
What kind of zone?


884
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.440
你要自己去发现
You have to find out


885
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.410
我们在调察那个保安  朱维尔
We're looking at the security guard, Jewell.


886
00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:39.450
-真的? -是的
- No shit? - No shit.


887
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.950
一定要调查发现炸弹的人
You always look at the guy who found the bomb,


888
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.960
就像你一定要调查发现尸体的人
just like you always look at the guy who found the body.


889
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.830
而且这个人  他有不良记录
But this guy, he's got a bad past.


890
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:52.670
符合英雄-放置炸弹者的犯罪侧写
Fits the profile of the hero-bomber to a T.


891
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.440
就是那个和他妈住在一起的胖混球  当然了
That fat fuck who lives with his mother. Of course.


892
00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:00.210
我怎么没想到这点  我是说 这真是太棒了
How did I miss that? I mean, that is amazing.


893
00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.050
哇
Ooh.


894
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.480
你很棒
You are good.


895
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.050
你非常棒
You're very good.


896
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.480
是吗
Yeah.


897
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:08.550
但这就意味着时间紧迫了
This kind of puts a clock on things, though.


898
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.450
你想要找个房间或者干脆上我的车?
You wanna get a room or just go to my car?


899
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:15.120
春宵一刻
This is happening.


900
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.420
春宵一刻
This is happening.


901
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.220
让我们赶紧离开这里
Let's get the fuck outta here.


902
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.290
-好的 -很好
- Okay. - Yeah.


903
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.740
宝贝  我需要你帮我做点儿修饰文字的事
Sugar, I need you to do one of those better word things you do.


904
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.610
你是说帮你改写文章?
You mean rewrite you?


905
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.480
是的  你知道我的文笔不好  不过这一次的报道比较特殊
Yeah, you know I write like a brick, and this one is kind of special.


906
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.450
是什么？
What is it?


907
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:43.250
哦 小事 就是 呃
Oh, nothing. It's just that the, uh,


908
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:48.450
FBI认为理查德.朱维尔是放炸弹的人 正在调查他
the FBI is looking at Richard Jewell as the bomber.


909
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.230
现在你有时间帮我了吗？
Do you have time for me now?


910
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.290
-我的时间任你支配 -很好 那我们开始工作吧
- I got all the time you need. - All right, let's work.


911
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.460
把所有事都告诉我
Tell me everything.


912
00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.490
你去哪？
Where you going?


913
00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.800
去拿我的笔记
To get my notes.


914

“最先警告警察在世纪奥林匹克公园

目前是联邦调查局的调查目标

理查德.朱维尔  33岁  前执法机关人员
Richard Jewell, 33, a former law enforcement officer


919
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.520
符合独行炸弹客的犯罪侧写
fits the profile of the lone bomber.


920
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.360
这份侧写大致为失意的白人男子
This profile generally includes a frustrated white man


921
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.360
退休警员  或退伍军人

922
00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.830

or police wannabe who seeks to become a hero.


923
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.340
随着爆炸的发生
Jewell has become a celebrity in the wake of the bombing,

朱维尔成为名人 并将登上今日秀”

FBI知道你有这些消息吗?

926
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.040
哦  是的  我的线人说每个人都知道了

CNN有了
CNN has it.


929
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.710

Got a guy at GBI says the same thing. Bureau's looking at Jewell.


930
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.340
那为什么没有任何人报导这件事？

989
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.760
-朱维尔先生... 联邦调查局来这里做什么?
- Mr. Jewell... - Why are the FBI here?


990
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.920
朱维尔先生 他们对你说了什么?

联邦调查局正在调查你吗?
Are the FBI investigating you?


996
00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:36.040

997
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:37.840
也包括你们所有人
That includes all of you, too.

他们有没有告诉你不能离开市区?

1000
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:43.220
朱维尔先生 你被捕了吗?
Mr. Jewell, are you under arrest?


1001
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:44.550
你可以随意走动吗?

- Who are you working with? - What happened out there?


1004
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.190
如今人们认为你是头号嫌疑犯
What do you think of the appearance that


1005
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.260
你如何看待这种现象?
people are saying that you are now the prime suspect?


1006
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:52.830
这是怎么回事 理查德?
What's going on, Richard?


1007
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.830
我不是嫌疑犯
I'm not a suspect.


1008
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.390
你为什么跟联邦调查局谈话？
Why are you talking to the FBI?


1009
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:57.970
朱维尔先生 联邦调查局找你做什么?
Mr. Jewell, what does the FBI want with you?


1010
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.440
能不能再给我们透露点信息?
Can you give us any more information?


1011
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.550
不好意思 那些媒体的人一直跟着我
Sorry, I think I got some media following me.


1012
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.610
不 那都是我们的人 我们的人
No. Those are our guys, bud. Those are our guys.


1013
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:59.260
“理查德·朱维尔 33岁 之前在执法部门工作”
"Richard Jewell, 33, a former law enforcement officer,"


1014
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:03.430
文章说 “符合独行炸弹客的犯罪侧写
the story goes on to say, "fits the profile of the lone bomber.


1015
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.000
这份侧写大致为失意的白人男子
This profile generally includes a frustrated white man


1016
00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.910
退休警员 或当过兵
who is a former police officer, member of the military,


1017
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.870
或者想要从警的人 此人一心想成为英雄
or police wannabe who seeks to become a hero.


1018
00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.940
第一个在世纪奥林匹克公园发现管状炸弹
The security guard who first alerted police to the pipe bomb


1019
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.950
并报告警方的保安
that exploded in Centennial Olympic Park,"


1020
00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:23.110
所以 直到出现明显的异常前
So, up until it obviously went sideways,


1021
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:26.090
那天晚上一切正常 对吗?
everything pretty normal about that evening, right?


1022
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:29.360
是的 我觉得就是一个普通的夜晚
No, it was a regular night from what I could tell.


1023
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:31.060
所有人都玩得很开心
Everyone was having a great time.


1024
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.690
就像在庆祝
It was like a celebration.


1025
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:35.030
是的 毫无...

1026
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:36.970
是的 你玩的很开心

1027
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.590
我也玩得很开心 是一段快乐时光
I was having fun. It was a good time.


1028
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.500
但是有几个家伙
But there was some guys


1029
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:43.000
带着啤酒罐或者之类的东西？
with beer cans or something like that?


1030
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.410
塔楼后面的家伙
Guys behind the tower.


1031
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.240
他们在干嘛? 他们在扔...
What were they doing there? They were throwing...


1032
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:47.940
-啤酒瓶 - 啤酒瓶 是的

1033
00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:50.810
他们在打闹 嬉戏
They were horsing around, fooling.


1034
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.180
我打断了他们 跟他们讲了一下 他们就离开了
I broke it up and I gave them atalking-to, and they left Yep.


1035
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:56.850
就在塔楼后面吗?
And that was behind the tower?


1036
00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:58.250
-是的 长官 - 好的
- Yes, sir. - Right


1037
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.090
然后你又回到塔楼附近
then you came back around the tower


1038
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.680
在那里你看见了被丢弃的包？
and that's where you saw the package unattended?


1039
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:04.490
-是的 长官 -没错
-Yes, sir. - Right


1040
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.970
你看到有人从长椅边离开吗?
And did you see anyone walking away from the bench?


1041
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.130
没有 长官 如果看到 我会跟着他的
No, sir. I would've tailed them if I did.


1042
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.470
好的
Yeah.


1043
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.810
所以 你也不知道是谁把包放在这里的?
So, you have no idea who might have put that package there?


1044
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.200
是的 长官
No, sir.


1045
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.910
但不管是谁干的 我觉得他们都该被处死
But whoever did, I think they ought to fry.


1046
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.470
是的 我们也这么认为 理查德
Yeah. We think so, too, Richard.


1047
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:24.850
必须的
Absolutely.


1048
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:28.340
听好了 我们打算这么做
So, here's what we're gonna do.


1049
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:30.580
为了做到尽量真实
We're trying to be as authentic as possible


1050
00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.750
这其中包括你是如何对待嫌疑人的
and part of that has to do with how you treat a suspect.


1051
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:34.720
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.


1052
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.920
好吗?所以 我们接下来要假装
All right? So, what we're gonna is we're gonna pretend


1053
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.430
把你带入到这个场景中
that we actually brought you in, in that regard.


1054
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.430
-可以吗？ - 这...
- Right? - That...


1055
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.060
我们向你宣读米兰达警告 你同意放弃这项权利
And we read you your Miranda rights and you've agreed to waive them.


1056
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.600
-事实上 你可以签一份表格 - 是的 为什么你不...
- In fact, we have a form you can si - Yeah. Why don't you..


1057
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:46.830
这就再好不过了
This'll be good.


1058
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:48.260
这样看上去就真实了
Just so it looks real.


1059

你得真的把名签上
You actually have to physically sign the paper.

1081
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.640
我们要装作什么都没有发生过
We're gonna pretend like none of that ever happened.


1082

把它拿出来 扔掉
Get her out there and we'll throw it away.


1087
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.520
现在我们要做的是

Richard, what did the FBI say to you? Just tell us.


1190
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:59.900
我们要联系上韦恩·斯科特有点困难
We are having some trouble connecting to Wayne Scott


1191
01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.340
我们希望稍后能从他那里得到更多信息
We hope to have more from him later.


1192
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:03.870
他可以给我们提供交通状况的信息 
He can update us about the traffic situation,


1193
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.500
同时自从世纪公园……
also since Centennial Park is...


1194
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.700
他们现在全都跟着我
They're all after me now.


1195
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.270
……他可能是我们目前唯一看到公园的人
...he may be our only view of the park for a while.


1196
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:10.940
所以我们会回过头再看 现在我们要把它还给
So we will checking back. Right now we're gonna throw it back to


1197
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.610
NBC新闻和汤姆·布罗考
NBC News and Tom Brokaw.


1198
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.080
据推测 FBI
The speculation is that the FBI


1199
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.280
即将用他们的说法“立案”
is close to "making the case," in their language.


1200
01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.620
他们很可能有充分证据马上逮捕他 
They probably have enough to arrest him right now,


1201
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.350
可能有充分理由起诉他 
probably enough to prosecute him,


1202
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.520
但你总想要有足够的证据来判他有罪
but you always wanna have enough to convict him as well.


1203
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.000
这个案子仍有许多漏洞
There are still some holes in this case.


1204
01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.690
为什么汤姆·布罗考这么说你？
Why did Tom Brokaw say that about you?


1205
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.660
那就是汤姆·布罗考
That was Tom Brokaw


1206
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:31.630
与世纪公园爆炸案的最新进展
with the latest update on the Centennial Park bombing.


1207
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.800
我们回来时……
When we come back...


1208
01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.370
我不知道
I don't know.


1209
01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.460
-嘿 这是谁？-我不认识
- Hey, who's this? - I don't know.


1210
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.720
我不认识这个男的是谁 跟我来 我们去采访他
I don't know who this guy is. Come with me. Let's get him.


1211
01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:59.360
先生？先生？先生？您是哪位 先生？是理查德的朋友吗？
Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Who are you, sir? Are you Richard's friend?

Who are you here to see? Who are you here to see?


1213
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:02.690
您是理查德的一个朋友吗？
Are you a friend of Richard's?


1214
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:03.890
-为什么您会在这儿？-您是哪位？

我是理查德的一个朋友
I'm a friend of Richard's.


1216
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:10.670
您能告诉我们一些内幕消息吗？您有帮他安装那个炸弹吗？
Can you give us some insight? Did you help him set that bomb?


1217
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.670
您叫什么？告诉我们一点什么吧？
What's your name? Tell us anything at all.


1218
01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.710
您是家属吗？
Are you a family member?


1219
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.500
我是理查德的一个朋友

1220
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.690
嘿

1221
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:29.150
-嘿  -外面真是一团糟

1222
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:32.720
你拿到欠我的100美元没？
You got that $100 you owe me?


1223
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:36.060
哦！您一定是妈妈了
Oh! You must be Mom.


1224
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:37.570
您好吗？我是沃森

1225
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.760
我很抱歉这个世界陷入了疯狂
I'm so sorry the world has gone insane.


1226
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.100
哦 吵死人了
Oh, that's annoying.


1227
01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:44.730
我们把电话拿走 好吗？
Let's get rid of that, shall we?


1228
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.330
呃……
Uh...


1229
01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.210
有点像在你耳里钻孔
It's kind of like a drill in your ear.


1230
01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.010
接下来 你只需要和我谈谈
For the next little while, the only person you need to talk to is me.


1231
01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.520
他得保持沉默
He does not open his mouth again


1232
01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:56.780
就算有警察出现 或是FBI探员

我生来就是要尊重权威 先生
I was raised to respect authority, sir.


1236
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.630
小伙子 权威就在窗外想要生吞活剥了你
Son, authority's what's outside that window looking to eat you alive.


1237
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.960

喔
Oh.


1243
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:26.050
是的 第三者 然后他们可以
Yeah, third party, then they can


1244
01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.480
-反对我们说的所有事情  -没事
- compel anything we say. - No.


1245

很高兴认识你 恕我冒昧 波比 谢谢
Very nice to meet you. Sorry to be rude, Bobi. Thanks.

异教组织呢
Religious cult?


1253
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:56.050
除非成为一名浸礼会教友属于异教徒
Not unless being a Baptist is a religious cult.


1254
01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:57.300
美国步枪协会

你跟3K党成员一起出去玩过吗
You ever hung out with any Ku Klux Klan members?


1257

If I did, it wouldn't have been on purpose.


1258
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:09.490
关于出书 你联系过其他律师吗
You contacted any other lawyers about this book deal?


1259

没有 只联系了你
No. You're the only one.


1260
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.590
理查德 这是死罪
Richard, this is capital crime here.


1261

要判死刑的
This is death penalty.


1262

我可以帮助你 但首先我要知道真相
I can help you, but only if I know the truth.


1263

1264
01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.770
没有
No.


1265
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.670
你是在问我有没有做这事？
Are you asking if I did it?


1266
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:32.650
我问你有没有参与世纪公园爆炸案 是的
I'm asking you if you had any part of the Centennial bombing, yes.


1267
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.850
所以 你与这件事有没有关
So, if you had anything to do with this,


1268
01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:38.380
有没有参与
had any part in this...


1269
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.650
我
I did...


1270
01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.030
我没有在世纪公园放炸弹
I did not plant that bomb in Centennial Park


1271
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.190
我误以为你是知道的
and I made the mistake of assuming you knew that.


1272
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:54.400
是 好吧 让我们把这些混蛋打的屁滚尿流
All right, well, let's beat the hell out of these bastards.


1273

你和理查德·朱维尔是什么关系
What is your relationship with Richard Jewell?


1276
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.450
我想如果不调查理查德·朱维尔
I think the FBI would be derelict


1277
01:08:19.530 --> 01:08:21.690
联邦调查局就会失职
not to investigate Richard Jewell.


1278
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:23.100
他们只是在做他们该做的工作
They're just doing their jobs.


1279
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:24.530
你什么时候再与他碰面

No, they're just doing their job.


1281
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.100

They're just making sure no rock is unturned.


1282

你会再与他碰面吗
Are you gonna meet with him again soon?

Possibly.


1290
01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:53.760
偷上车不算侵宅 对吗 布莱恩特先生
Not quite real estate law, is it, Mr. Bryant?


1291
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.530
哇哦 我的天
Whoa! Jesus Christ!


1292
01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:57.740
你是何方神圣
Who the hell are you?


1293
01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.630
我可以成为你最好的朋友
I could be the best friend you'll ever have.

Have you secured an actual defense attorney for Richard yet?


1298
01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.070
无可奉告
No comment


1299
01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.410
-从我车上下去  -瞧瞧 无可奉告帮不了我
- Get out of the car. - See, "no comment" doesn't help me,


1300
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.950
也就意味着我帮不了你
whi means I can't help you.


1301
01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:19.090
这就是你想做的吗 你想帮我
Is that what you wanna do? You want to help me?

Watson, I don't get the sense you grasp the tank that's about to roll over you.


1303

我们现在在谈美国政府

1304
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:25.550

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:49.680
滚下车
Get out of my car!


1319
01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.290
真受够了
I'm sick of this shit.


1320
01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.080
你知道到哪里可以找到我
You know where to find me.


1321
01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.200
-是的 别担心  -我从来没有上过电视
Yeah. Don't worry. - Never been on TV before.


1322
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.530
没事的
You'll be fine.


1323
01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.460
朱维尔先生的律师 布莱恩特先生
Mr. Jewell's attorney, Mr. Bryant.


1324
01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.630
-谢谢你能来  -你太客气了
Thanks for coming in. - You're welcome.


1325
01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:12.900
政府那边怎么说
What are the authorities telling you about


1326
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.500
-他们怀疑你的当事人吗  -嗯 没什么
their suspicions about your client? - Uh, nothing.


1327
01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:17.100
没有深层次沟通
No communication whatsoever?


1328
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.910
他们对我说的话就是他们不会去抓他
All they've said to me is that they're not going to arrest him.


1329
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.380
这就是他们昨天告诉我的
That's what they told me yesterday.


1330
01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:23.650
你信吗
You believe that?


1331
01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.710
不信
No.


1332
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:26.380
你觉得他们会去抓他
You think they are going to arrest him?


1333
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:29.450
我认为不管他们抓不抓都不会告诉我
I don't think they'd tell me whether they were or they weren't That's all.


1334
01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:32.760
你认为联邦调查局对你的当事人跟踪调查
What do you think of the manner in which the FBI has treated your client


1335
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.130
-会是什么态度  -我想不管是谁
pursuing this investigation? - I think whoever the bum was


1336
01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.260
泄露了理查德·朱维尔是调查重点的信息
that leaked that Richard Jewell was the focus of this investigation,


1337
01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.570
他都应该受到严厉的起诉
he deserves to be prosecuted or dealt with in some serious way.


1338
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.200
我认为这个调查
I don't think that this investigation


1339
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:49.110
应该秘密进行 不该暴露
should be conducted under world spotlight, if you will, like this.


1340
01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.450
关于这个小屋被搜查的事 你的当事人跟你说了什么吗
What's your client told you about this cabin that's being searched today?


1341
01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.110
据我了解 那是他原来的住处
It's his former residence, as I understand it.


1342
01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:55.480
你应该知道一些事情
You need to understand something


1343
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:59.790
从这事发生的第二天起 为了这件事
I have barely had the time to take a breath in this case


1344
01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.690
我连喘气的时间都没有
since it started the other night.


1345
01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.720
我们就开始跟媒体和联邦调查局周旋
We have been reacting to the media, to the FBI,


1346
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.590
屁股都没落凳子
and I have not sat down


1347
01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:11.900
一直忙着对整件事做深入调查
and conducted an in-depth interview about all these things


1348
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:13.340
那些是你们想知道的事
that y'all are asking me about.


1349
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.960
那么为什么你这么相信他是无辜的呢
Then why are you so convinced of his innocence?


1350
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.440
因为我认识理查德有段时间了
Because I've known Richard for a while.


1351
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:18.500
我看着他的眼睛 问他这个问题
I've looked him in the eye and I've asked him the question.


1352
01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.410
但是你也承认你都不知道他有个小屋
But you've admitted to me you didn't even know he had a cabin.


1353
01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.810
你不知道这些事 不知道他之前被捕
You didn't know about this... this prior arrest.


1354
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.610
你不知道他曾经犯罪
You didn't know about the prior misdemeanors.


1355
01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.650
关于他的从前 有太多事情你不知道
There's a whole lot of priors you didn't know about.


1356
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:30.190
我没有对理查德的过去做系统调查
I have not conducted a thorough investigation into Richard's history.


1357
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:31.290
不 我可以理解这一切
No, I understand all that.


1358
01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.750
我猜到了 我之所以问你的是考虑到你还没有做调查
I guess what I'm asking you is considering that you haven't done that


1359
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.790
考虑到有些事情你还不知道
and considering there are things that you didn't know,


1360
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.190
你为什么如此确信他是无辜的
why are you so convinced of his innocence?


1361
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.290
因为我相信他
Because I believe him.


1362
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.350
平白无故
Plain and simple?


1363
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:40.900
是的 没有理由
Yeah. That's right


1364
01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:44.400
我对很多人很多事都不了解
I don't know a whole lot of things about a whole lot of people that I know.


1365
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:48.300
我没有理查德的警方记录 你可能有 但我…
I don't have Richard's police records. You may. I don't...


1366
01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:52.470
我只是在一些事情上没有跟上节奏 仅此而已
I have not gotten up to speed on some things. That's all.


1367
01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.670
但只是因为我不知道这些事
But just because I don't know these things


1368
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:56.910
并不意味着我没有觉察到
doesn't mean that I don't have a feel


1369
01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.140
理查德与这起事件有关
for where I think Richard is in this case.


1370
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.290
你记得哈伯沙姆治安部门
Were you aware that the Habersham Sheriffs Department


1371
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.790
要他去寻求心理咨询吗
had asked him to seek psychological counseling?


1372
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.350
我也不知道
I don't know that either.


1373
01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:09.650
但是我知道很多人都应该看心理医生
But I know a lot of people who ought to have psychological counseling.


1374
01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:11.860
沃森·布莱恩特 非常感谢
Watson Bryant, thank you very much.


1375

First of all, we wanna reassure the public that


1378
01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.510
让他们相信尽管发生了昨天的悲剧 亚特兰大仍然是个安全的地方
Atlanta is a safe place in spite of the tragedy of last evening.


1379
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:24.940
你好
Hello?


1380
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:28.100
你因为假扮警察被捕过吗
Were you arrested for impersonating an officer?


1381
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:30.580
是的 有一次
Yeah, once.


1382
01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.240
-那情况很复杂  -那是……
- It was complicated. - It was...


1383
01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.140
你打算告诉我吗
Were you planning on telling me?


1384
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:37.480
是的 当然 我只是
Yeah, of course. I just...


1385
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:40.590
昨天有点受惊吓 我忘记告诉你了
In all the hoopla yesterday, I guess I just forgot.


1386
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.920
我的天啊
Jesus Christ! What the...


1387
01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:44.990
还有别的事情忘记说了吗
Was there anything else that you forgot?


1388
01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.100
因为我刚刚在今日秀上表现的笨手笨脚
'Cause I just had my ass handed to me on the fucking Today Show!


1389
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:50.570
拜你所赐
Thanks a lot


1390

现在计时多少
What are we clocking?

He has the lead, Michael Johnson is closing on the finish!

Michael Johnson running for gold! And it's Olympic history!


1404
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.950

就是用这儿的公用电话打的 
From the pay phone that was right here.

我们也知道理查德在公园里 
We also know that Richard was inside the park

一分钟 所以他不可能做到
One minute. So he couldn't have done it.

一个来回？ 那也不可能

他们只是来寻查
They're just gonna look around.


1425

这屋子里你有枪吗？

是啊 当然 去拿出来 
Yeah, of course you do. Go get them.


1428
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:57.660
把它们放到你床上 放在眼皮下 不要有任何隐藏
Lay them on your bed so we can see them. We don't want any surprises.


1429
01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.690
他们要来多少人
How many of them are coming in here?


1430
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:03.000

要来几个
There... There's a couple.


1432
01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.870
他们能脱鞋进屋吗？
Can they leave their shoes outside the door?


1433
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:14.400
好 我可以问问他们 波比 我不知道他们是否愿意 
Well, I could ask them, Bobi. I don't know if they would oblige.


1434
01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.410
哦 上帝啊！
Oh, God.


1435
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:22.890

Oh, good Lord.


1436

嗯...
Um...


1437
01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:32.220
你在期待丧尸入侵吗？
Were you expecting a zombie invasion or something?


1438
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:36.630
不 我不期待丧尸 我期待鹿 我打猎 
No, I wasn't expecting zombies. I expect deer. I hunt.


1439
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.930
你打猎？好吧 
You hunt? Okay.


1440

雷达 我向你解释一些事情吧 
Radar, let me explain something to you.


1441
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.540
你现在唯一的罪
All you're guilty of right now


1442
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:45.270
就是让人以为你是安置炸弹的嫌疑人
is looking like the kind of guy who might set off a bomb.


1443
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:50.110
你的所有加固犯罪形象的举动都会把我们逼上绝路
But everything you do that promotes that image is gonna hang us.


1444
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:52.880
抱歉 用词不当
Sorry. Poor choice of words.


1445
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:57.690
外面那些豺狼想把你当成案板上的肉 
Those jackals out there, they want your ass on a chopping block.


1446
01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.810
所以还有任何古怪
I just... Is there anything else odd or quirky


1447
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:04.790
或稀奇的事还有待我发现吗
or fucking weird that I'm gonna discover today?


1448
01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.490
是 有点
Yeah, kind


1449
01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.260
我好几年没有交税了 
I haven't paid my taxes in about a couple years.


1450
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:16.170
情况越来越好了 
This gets better and better.


1451
01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:20.800
枪 枪 枪 我讨厌枪 
Guns, guns, guns. I hate guns.


1452
01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:23.350
每次理查德去打猎 我都说 
Every time Richard goes hunting, I say,


1453
01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:26.180
你不准把死斑比拖进这里来 
"Don't you dare drag a dead Bambi in here.


1454
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.110
我不吃斑比肉 
I don't wanna eat Bambi."


1455
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.110
但你知道什么吗？
But you know what?


1456
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:34.220
理查德 当他是哈伯沙姆县治安官的副手时
Richard, when he was deputy with the Habersham County Sheriffs,


1457
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:37.620
他在射击测试中得了98分 
he got 98 out of 100 on his shooting test.


1458
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:40.790
太棒了 嗯-嗯 
It was awesome. Mmm-hmm.


1459
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:44.460
了不起 
That's great.


1460
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:47.170
好吧 
-Okay.


1461
01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.600
你不要说话 我来说 重复
You don't talk. I talk. Say it.


1462
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:51.310
我不说话 
I don't talk.


1463
01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:54.940
但我要这些家伙知道这点 
But I want those guys to know that


1464
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:57.280
我也是执法人员 就像他们一样 
I'm law enforcement, too. Just like them.


1465
01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.050
听着 就是这点
See, right there?


1466
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.480
你说话了 我们要避免这样 好吗
That's talking. That's what we don't want, okay?


1467
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:10.490
你挑了一个好律师 理查德 
You picked the right lawyer, Richard.


1468
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.830
都准备好了吗
We all set?


1469
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.700
-是的 -好吧 我们走 快点 
- Yeah. - All right, let's go. Come on.

Yeah, so, you guys go ahead and take everything.


1477
01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:41.750
拿毯子也好 想拿啥拿啥 我也是执法人员 我能理解
Take the carpet, whatever you need. I'm law enforcement, too, so I get it


1478
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:43.620
只要明白你拿的东西
Just know that whatever you take,


1479
01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:45.890
都能证明我的清白
it's just gonna prove that I didn't do anything.


1480
01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.230
是 我们以前做过这个 
Yeah, we've done this before.

你将成为法律顾问 布莱恩特先生？
You'll be counsel, Mr. Bryant?


1482
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.230
计划如此 是的 
That's the plan, yeah.


1483
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.730
好的 如果你要留下 你得戴上这些
All right, if you're gonna stay here, you're gonna have to put these on.


1484
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:57.570
好 我们走吧 手套和脚套

1485
01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.540

1486
01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.740
你听到了 要戴脚套和手套

1487
01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.140

Watson, they're taking my Tupperware.

你读过那本书吗？
You ever read that book?


1494
01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:59.400
那里面有很多关于警察程序的内容 
Got a lot in it about police procedure.


1495
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:03.070
很好的一本书 有点争议 
It's a good one. It's kind of controversial.


1496
01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:09.010
这是一本好书 
It's a good book.


1497

1500
01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:24.920
你知道吗 其实如果你们在外面等着
You know what? Actually, it might be easier


1501
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.620
我们工作会更容易一些
if you guys just waited outside while we did our jobs.


1502
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.320
-好主意 我们出去吧  -谢谢！
- Good idea Yeah, let's do that - Thank you.


1503
01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.430
我们出去 理查德 让我们离开这鬼地方 
Let's do that, Richard. Let's get the hell out of here.


1504
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.630
谢谢配合

1505
01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.800
约翰逊 罗萨里奥 有发现吗
Johnson, Rosario, anything?


1506
01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.310
我们之前怎么说的
What was the agreement?


1507
01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.820
我不说话
That I wouldn't talk.


1508
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.050
是 那你怎么做的
Yeah, whafd you do?


1509
01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:50.880
我说话了
I talked.


1510
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.650
他们没安好心 你懂吗？你知道的 对吗？
They wanna fry you. You understand that? You know that, right?


1511
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:59.760
这里每个人都没安好心
Everyone here wants to fry you.


1512
01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.890
你就是一块培根肉 
You're a little piece of bacon.


1513
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:06.300
好吧 聊点轻松的 
Well, on a lighter note,


1514
01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:10.800
你从来没有告诉过我你跳槽的公司名字 
you never did tell me the name of the firm you moved to and whatnot


1515
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.070
我自己开的公司 
I opened my own.


1516
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.630
什么使你做那样的事情？
What made you do something like that?


1517
01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.780
公司意味着合伙人 合伙人认为他们可以告诉你是谁 
Firms mean partners, and partners think they can tell you who to be.


1518
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:20.640
我不太在乎别人对我的要求 
I don't care much for being dictated to.


1519
01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.580
嘿！你没有权利 
Hey! You have no right


1520
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:24.310
-给老娘回来  -妈妈 怎么了
- Come back here. - Mama, what's wrong?


1521
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:26.580
他们搜查了我的内衣裤
They went through my underthings.


1522
01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.190
他们想让我们受多少侮辱？
How much indignity do they want us to take?


1523
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:31.890
好吧 波比 嘿 等等 伙计们 不好意思 
All right, Bobi. Hey, hold on, fellas. Excuse me.


1524
01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:34.350
妈妈 嘿...
Mama, hey...


1525
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.890
波比 对不起 伙计们 
Bobi. Excuse me, fellas.


1526
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:38.030
波比 
Bobi.


1527
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.500
-打扰一下 -他们从你这里拿走了什么？
- Excuse me. - What did they take from you?


1528
01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:41.000
请退后 请退后
Hold on now. Hold on.


1529
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.500
波比 让我来
Bobi, let me take care of it for you.


1530
01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.200
交给我好吗
Can I take care of it for you?


1531
01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:48.040
我去拿 抱歉
gonna go get them. Excuse me.


1532
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.410
你有什么可以跟我们分享？
What can you share with us?


1533
01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.350
显然他们找到了一些非常危险的连裤袜 
They found some really dangerous pantyhose, apparently.


1534
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.780
-是的 
-Yeah.


1535
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:57.110
理查德 
Richard.


1536
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:59.280
过来一下 我想跟你谈谈
Come here for a sec. I want to talk to you.


1537
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:02.530
-快点进来  -好的 警官
- Come on inside. - Yes, sir.


1538
01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:04.090
我能帮什么？
What can I help with?


1539
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.960
只要进来一下 一会儿 
Just come on inside. Just for a second.


1540
01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:09.990
他们从房子里搜出了什么
What did they pull out of the house?


1541
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:11.360
是他做的吗 沃森
Did he do it, Watson?


1542
01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:14.530
不 他没有 理查德·朱维尔是无辜的 他是英雄 
No, he did not. Richard Jewell is an innocent man. He's a hero.


1543
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:16.630
如果他是无辜的 那为什么联邦调查局在这里？
If he's innocent, then why is the FBI here?


1544
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.800
我们欢迎联邦调查局 我们很高兴他们在这里 
We welcome the FBI. We're glad they're here.


1545
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:23.510
不 你没有 
No, you don't.


1546
01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.650
你知道这是假的  凯西
You know that's not true, Kathy.


1547
01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.590
我能看看这些盒子吗？
Can I see those boxes, please?


1548
01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.490
好 我们接下来要做这些事
All right, here's what we're gonna do.


1549
01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:36.920
我把手机给你
I'm gonna hand you this phone,


1550
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:39.090
等手机接通后
and when I do, you're gonna wait till the beep


1551
01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.990
你就说
and then you're gonna say into it,


1552
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.230
“世纪公园有一颗炸弹 你有30分钟”
"There's a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes."


1553
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:45.300
我...呃...
I'm, uh...


1554
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.800
抱歉 为什么
I'm sorry, Why?


1555
01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:50.740
我们需要一个声音样本 你说几遍
We need a voice exemplar. Like you to say it a few times.


1556
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:52.970
“世纪公园有一颗炸弹 你有30分钟”
"There's a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes."


1557
01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.910
这可能是证明你清白的唯一方法
It might be the only way to clear your name.


1558
01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.140
我的确想帮你们  我也是个执法者
I do wanna help y'all. I'm law enforcement, too.


1559
01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.810
好吧  那你肯定知道这是有迹可循的吧？
Well, yeah. Then you should know how evidentiary this is, right?


1560
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:06.460
所以  说“世纪公园有一颗炸弹 你有30分钟”
So, "There's a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes."


1561
01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.350
"30分钟"  好吧
"30 minutes." Okay.


1562
01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:14.090
-响铃之后？  -对
- After the beep? - Yeah.


1563
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:19.330
世纪公园有一颗炸弹 你有30分钟
There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes.


1564
01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.260
好  再来一遍  大点声
Okay, one more time. Just a little louder.


1565
01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.810
世纪公园有一颗炸弹 你有30分钟
There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes.


1566
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.340

Okay, that's great. Can you do it one more time?


1567
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:32.510
要不再多说几遍吧  连着说
Maybe let's do a series. We'll do a couple in a row.


1568
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.080

There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes.


1572
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:53.330
世纪公园有一颗炸弹 你有30分钟

There is a bomb in Centennial Park.


1574
01:22:56.170 --> 01:22:58.300
你他妈开玩笑呢？不  不  你别跟他说话
Are you fucking kidding me? No, no, you don't talk to him.


1575
01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:59.400
他们说这是标准流程
It's standard procedure, they said.


1576
01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.840
狗屁  该死
No, hell it is.


1577
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.380
-俄罗斯  -布莱恩特先生  听着
- In Russia. - Mr. Bryant, listen.


1578
01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.310
你的当事人是自愿的
Your client volunteered this.


1579
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:07.010
胡扯  谁知道你们有没有资格
bullshit. Maybe you can do this. Maybe you can't.


1580
01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.680
今天不行  走吧  理查德
You're not doing it today. Let's go, Richard.

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.080
-我们走  -我答应他们了
- Let's go. - I told them I'm doing it


1582
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:11.590
他们没准能证明我的清白
if it helps clear my name.


1583
01:23:11.690 --> 01:23:13.920
-我们走！今天不行  -你的当事人同意了
- Let's go! Not today. - Your client agreed to this.


1584
01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:16.020
我要起诉你这个混...
I'm gonna sue your ass...


1585
01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:17.360
-故意剥夺他的...  -好吧
- for intentional violation... - Okay.


1586
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:19.190
-宪法权利  -好吧
- ...of his constitutional rights. - Okay.


1587
01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.230
我什么都不管了  你们就是一帮混蛋
I'm having all this shit excluded. You guys are full of shit


1588
01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:23.590
走吧
Let's go.


1589
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.990
我们能搞定
We got it.


1590
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.380
噢  天
Oh, God.


1591
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.980
晚安
Have a good night.


1592
01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.890
他们为什么连吸尘器都要拿走
What do they want with the vacuum cleaner?


1593
01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.450
好了  这里完事了
All right We're done here.


1594
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.590
理查德？
Richard?


1595
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:06.240
我没事  嗯  没事
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.


1596
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:07.380
怎么了？
What's wrong?


1597
01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.600
你进去吧
Let's get you inside.


1598
01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.070
大卫  你能给她拿点儿喝的么？
Dave, can you get her something to drink?


1599
01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.050
-拿点儿水？  -好的  没问题
- Maybe some water? - Yeah. Sure.


1600
01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.750
怎么了
What's going on?


1601
01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.960
没事
It's nothing.


1602
01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:25.550
我挺好
I'm fine.


1603
01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.250
他们把我的特百惠杯子都拿走了
They took all my Tupperware.


1604
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:49.650
他们要我那些杯子干什么？
What would they need with my Tupperware?


1605
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:53.620
炸弹袭击者用杯子装的钉子
The bomber used Tupperware to hold the nails.


1606
01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:55.120
拿走也是正常的
That's standard.


1607
01:24:57.530 --> 01:25:00.260
好吧  这跟你有什么关系？
Well, what does that have to do with you?


1608
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:03.990
他们还拿了我照顾孩子的带子  还有迪士尼电影
And they took my babysitting tapes. My Disney movies.


1609
01:25:04.170 --> 01:25:07.300
嗯  我认为他们想看看
Yeah, I think they did that because they wanted to see


1610
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:09.800
我们是不是碰巧录到了什么
if we mighfve recorded something on the tapes


1611
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:11.740
比如政治言论之类的
like a political statement or something.


1612
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:16.280
你为什么要替这些人说话？
Why do you keep defending these people?


1613
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:18.710
我没有  我就解释解释
I'm not defending. I'm just explaining.


1614
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.410
够了  闭嘴！
Well, stop it!


1615
01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.190
-嘿 她来了 嘿  -嗨
- Hey, there she is. Hey. - Hi.

This is, uh... This is Nadya She is, uh...


1618
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.730
她告诉我要做什么
She tells me what to do.


1619
01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.730
来  我来拿  你可真好
Here. Let me take that. That's very nice of you.


1620
01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.000
我想你们也许想吃晚餐
I thought you might want some dinner.


1621
01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:42.370
你真好
Bless your heart.


1622
01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:44.870
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you. - Of course.


1623
01:25:45.710 --> 01:25:48.010
嗨 我是理查德
Hi, I'm... I'm Richard.


1624
01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:50.410
我怎么跟你说的  理查德？
What did I tell you about talking, Rich?


1625
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:51.340
噢
Oh.


1626
01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:54.410
噢 天 好吧  看来我再也不能说话了
Oh, God, yeah. I guess I can't talk anymore.


1627
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.230
出来吧 理查德 你躲得了初一 躲不过十五
Come on, Richard, you can't hide anymore.


1628
01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.500
-理查德  一个问题  就一个  -是你做的吗？
- Richard, one question. That's all. - Did you do it?


1629
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.100
理查德  你造了多少炸弹？
Richard, how many bombs have you made?


1630
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:27.250
联邦调查局从你家拿了什么  理查德？
What did the FBI take out of your house, Richard?


1631
01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.470
好的
Yeah.


1632
01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:27.770
手榴弹？
Hand grenade?


1633
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.150
-你要个手榴弹做什么？  -对  它是空的
- What do you got a hand grenade for? - Yeah, it's hollowed out


1634
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:34.480
只是个镇纸  我在军备品店买的
It's a paperweight. I bought it from a military surplus store.


1635
01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:36.310
-好吧  -没有杀伤力
- Yeah. - But it's nothi


1636
01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.550
天啊  你当然是买的
Christ, of course you did.


1637
01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:41.620
长椅上的木片？
Piece of the bench?


1638
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:45.130
...碎片  这是做什么用的？  那是什么？
Splintered piece of... What does that mean? What is that?


1639
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.500
对  我从犯罪现场拿了一块长椅碎片
Yeah, I took a small piece of the bench from the crime scene.


1640
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.930
-从发生爆炸的地方？  -这是纪念品  留念
- From where the bomb was? - It's a souvenir. A memento.


1641
01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.630
你为什么这么做？
What'd you do that for?


1642
01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:58.570
我觉得我做得很好  那晚值得纪念
I think it was a pretty memorable night where I did something pretty great.


1643
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:02.100
所以  我觉得那块碎片值得保存
So, I thought maybe that was worth holding on to.


1644
01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.040
哇  好吧
Wow. Okay.


1645
01:28:04.810 --> 01:28:05.750
很好
Nice.


1646
01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.150
-嘿  -嘿
- Hey. - Hey.


1647
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:20.130
他们想要你的头发  还有掌纹
They want your hair now, and your palm prints.


1648
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:23.190
真是好时候
Good times.


1649
01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.460
进来
Come in.


1650
01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:34.240
拔了25根  采集25根

1651
01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:35.970
我告诉你  你也许有权利这么做
I tell you, you might have a warrant for this,


1652
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:38.340
但你要是这么对我  先打赢我吧
but if you were to do this to me, you'd have to fight me.


1653
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.250
你得打屎我才行
You'd have to beat the shit out of me!


1654
01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.720
你真不像律师啊  顾问
Not very lawyerly of you, counselor.


1655
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:44.780
是  好吧...
Yeah, well...


1656
01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:47.590
咱们能在我妈回家前搞定吗？
Can we just get this over with before my mama comes back?


1657
01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.420
我不想让她看见
I'd like her not to see this.


1658
01:28:56.770 --> 01:28:58.260
告诉我 理查德
Tell me, Richard,


1659
01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.530
你还为你是执法人而骄傲吗？
you still proud to be law enforcement?


1660
01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:05.970
你知道吗 要是我工作再努力些
You know what? Maybe if I did my job a little better,


1661
01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.210
把群众疏散得足够远
and got people far enough away,


1662
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.010
那我现在就不用坐在这里了
then I wouldn't be sitting here right now.


1663
01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:15.640
是啊  他真是个魔鬼  小伙子  你们想办法吧
Yeah, he's a real monster. Boy, you guys nailed it.


1664
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:20.410
你们有计算过现场到公共电话的时间距离吗
Have you dummies done the math yet on the call from the pay phone?


1665
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.150
嘿 你听着 去他妈的公共电话 行不
Hey, listen, fuck the pay phone! Okay?


1666
01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:25.720
我的委托人是那晚公园里的人
My clients were the people in the park that night


1667
01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.530
他们不该被炸得脑浆遍地
that didn't deserve to get their fucking heads blown off.


1668
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:31.130
你知道  我的确对你们的遭遇很遗憾
You know, I actually feel sorry for you guys.


1669
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.400
等真正的投弹手故伎重施
When the real bomber does it again,


1670
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:35.400
人们质疑“联邦调查局”在哪的时候
and the country asks, "Where was the FBI?"


1671
01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:38.240
你们会说“我们正忙着采集理查德·朱维尔的头发样本”
You're gonna say, "We were busy getting hair samples from Richard Jewell."


1672
01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.600
-我弄完了  -全都好了？真棒
- I'm done here. - All set? Great


1673
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:41.980
哦  挺好
Oh, good.


1674
01:29:42.150 --> 01:29:45.120
那个  理查德  非常感谢你的专业配合
Well, Richard, thank you very much for your professional consideration.


1675
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.770
你知道  警察不为难警察
You know, cop to cop.


1676
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.380
”我们是联邦调查局“
"We're the FBI."


1677
01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.620
我看着你警察不为难警察呢  就在这
I got your cop to cop. Right here.


1678
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:52.910
-呵呵  -门在那
- Uh-huh. - There's the door.


1679
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:54.390
找到了 谢谢
Found it Thank you.


1680
01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.660
理查德  我们对待这些蠢蛋
Richard, we need to be a little less


1681
01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:05.430
要少操心  多正义
solicitous and a little more righteous with these assjacks.


1682
01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.270
我说 只是头发 会长回来的  没事
I mean, it's just hairs. They'll grow back. It's fine.


1683
01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.640
你说什么？
Whafd you say?


1684
01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.670
不过是头发  会长出来的
They're just hairs. They'll grow back.


1685
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.500
不过是头发  嘿！
They're just hair. Hey!


1686
01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.680
这破事怎么没让你像我一样气急败坏
Why doesn't this shit make you as angry as it makes me?


1687
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:22.150
我生气啊
I am angry.


1688
01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.050
你耍我吧
You could have fooled me.


1689
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.490
你生气？
You're angry?


1690
01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.820
我当然生气
'Course I am.


1691
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:32.930
我不知道用“生气”足不足以形容我的感受
I don't know if "angry" is even a big enough word for how I feel.


1692
01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:36.660
-拜托  -那就别像个擦鞋垫一样
- Come on. - Then stop being such a doormat.


1693
01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.460
别再老帮他们说话
Stop trying to be their best friend.


1694
01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.030
你知道  他们在外边笑话你呢
You know, they're making fun of you out there.


1695
01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.630
-你知道他们怎么说你的吗？  -我知道！
- You know what they're calling you? - I know that!


1696
01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.730
我明白他说"警察不为难警察"是什么意思 
I know what it means when he says "cop to cop."


1697
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:46.440
他不是真的说“警察不为难警察” 
He doesn't mean cop to cop.


1698
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:48.910
-他觉得我是面团宝宝  -是吗 我差点就信了
- He thinks I'm the Pillsbury Doughboy. - Do you? Could have fooled me.


1699
01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:50.640
我还以为你们要订婚了 
I thought you guys were gonna get engaged.


1700
01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:54.710
嘿！理查德！现在去吃块饼干吧 
Hey! Richard! You go for a cookie right now,


1701
01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.380
我要把你的双手剁下来塞进你屁股里！
I'm gonna chop off your hands and shove them up your ass!


1702
01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.620
那就吃块饼干呀 混蛋 
Try eating a cookie then, fucker.


1703
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.960
你为啥要成为我的代理律师？
Why'd you wanna represent me and be my lawyer?


1704
01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:07.220
嘿 你好像需要帮助 
Hey, you looked like you needed some help.


1705
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:11.370
你好像需要通过出书事务挣点钱 
You look like you might've needed money from a book deal.


1706
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:12.870
呃 我想问你 你为啥选择我呢？
Well, let me ask you, why'd you pick me?


1707
01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:15.300
电话簿里有许多律师 为啥你偏偏选择我？
There's a lot of lawyers in the phone book. Whafd you pick me for?


1708
01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:17.170
我选你是因为你是唯一
I picked you because you were the only one


1709
01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.000
在“美国小商业管理局”工作的律师 
at the US Small Business Admin bureau


1710
01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.410
而且你没有把我当成一个五岁小孩 没有叫我
who didn't treat me like a five-year-old, and call me,


1711
01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.770
“零食狂” 也没有叫我“死胖子”
"bag of snacks" and "blimp,"


1712
01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:26.010
“米其林怪”以及“面团宝宝”
"Michelin Man/1 and "Pillsbury Doughboy."


1713
01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.540
只有你把我当成一个人 
You're the only one who treated me like a human being!


1714
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:34.520
但现在你吼了我 要求我变成一个我不会成为的人 
And now you're just yelling at me, telling me to be somebody that I'm not!


1715
01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:36.390
我不知道要怎样成为这样一个人 
I don't know how to be that guy!


1716
01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.450
你就是这样一个人！我是我自己！
You're that guy! I'm me!


1717
01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:49.200
怎么了
What?


1718
01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.270
我不知道你说啥 
I don't know what you're talking about.


1719
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:01.810
我们办公室和这屋子被监听了

1720
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:05.320
噢 天呐 
Oh, my Lord.


1721
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.220
他们怎么可以做这种事？
How can they do that?


1722
01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:12.690
很简单 因为你很好糊弄
easy because you don't matter.


1723
01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.030
这就是为什么 
That's how come.


1724
01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:31.710
我们必须离开
We need to go!


1725
01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:35.050
走啊！
Move!


1726
01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:40.320
你们必须离开
You guys gotta


1727
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:48.300
我们要撤了 
We need to evacuate!


1728
01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.920
达奇斯先生
Mr. Dutchess.


1729
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:49.520
有空吗
You got a minute?


1730
01:33:50.890 --> 01:33:52.050
我来付
I got that.

1732
01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:55.460
-我能先把东西吃完吗？-不行 
- Can I finish my food? - Nope.


1733
01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.030
呃 好吧 
Mmm. That's good.


1734
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:05.710
他们已经认为
They've decided that since


1735
01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:08.370
既然你不可能亲自打911电话
you can't have placed the 911 call yourself


1736
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:10.910
那你一定有个同伙 
that you must've had a partner.


1737
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:15.580
他们觉得你的同伙一定是你的男朋友 
They think your partner must be your homosexual boyfriend,


1738
01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.620
他们觉得那个人可能就是我 
which they decided is probably me.


1739
01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:21.450
啥？
What?


1740
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.930
他们让我带窃听装置
They asked me to wear a wire.


1741
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:29.060
我告诉他们我不需要 我说你曾是一个英雄 
I told them to shove it. I said you were a hero.


1742
01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:30.900
而他们说 “好吧 要是他真的是个英雄 
And they said, "Well, if he really is a hero,


1743
01:34:30.970 --> 01:34:33.230
那么他就不需要紧张兮兮 你也不需要 ”
then he's got nothing to worry about and neither do you."


1744
01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:38.260
他们还说 呃 你的一个GBI伙计
They also told me that, uh, one of your GBI buddies


1745
01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.870
就是他来看你的时候 你给做了面条的那个伙计
you know, the one you made lasagna for when he came over...


1746
01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:41.970
我知道 米勒嘛 
Yeah, Miller.


1747
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:43.170
对 
Yeah.


1748
01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:44.570
是的 
Yeah.


1749
01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:46.810
他也带了窃听装置
He was wearing a wire, too.


1750
01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:49.550
他对你揪着不放
He's got a lot on you.


1751
01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:57.680
还有个事儿 
There's, one other thing.


1752
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.930
他们还问我有没有试过土质铁管炸弹
They asked me if I'd ever had any experience with pipe bombs


1753
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.930
我必须告诉他们事实 
and I had to tell them the truth.


1754
01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.830
你知道 这种小炸弹 
You know, the little ones.


1755
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:12.310
我们以前把它丢进地鼠洞里 那时我还是个住在维吉尼亚州西部的小孩
We used to drop them down gopher holes when I was a kid in West Virginia


1756
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.530
大卫…天呐 
David... Lord.


1757
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.640
我告诉他们这件事在我认识理查德以前已经过去好几年了 
I told them this was years before I even met Richard.


1758
01:35:17.710 --> 01:35:20.080
我告诉他们好多次了 
I told them a couple times.


1759
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.310
然而…
Still...


1760
01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:25.120
对不起 
I'm sorry.


1761
01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:32.450
没关系

1762
01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.130
好吧
Yep.


1763
01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.190

1764
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:43.140
我做过…

1765
01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.040
嘿 关…

1766
01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:51.340
天呐！你在干啥？
Come on! What are you doing?


1767
01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.450
我们不能看炸弹爆炸的电影
We can't be watching movies with bombs and explosions


1768
01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.150
因为此时他们在监听 
when they're listening.


1769
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:01.150
拜托…

I'm... I'm trying to do the right thing.


1772
01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.870
对吗？
Right?


1773
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:18.940
各位…他们难道没有监听吗？
Guys... Are they not listening?


1774
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:30.280
嘿 妈妈 对不起

我不知道怎样保护你不受这些人的伤害 
I don't know how to protect you from these people.


1790
01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.670
嘿 你知道吗 你不需要保护我 
Hey, you know... You know what? You don't have to protect me.


1791
01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.110
我才是负责保护的人 我才是

Yeah, she's had about three days to be proud of her son


1799
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:03.340
然后他们就夺走了她的骄傲

1800

对 这样做是不对的

你是来自首的吗
Are you here to turn yourself in?


1807
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.300
不知道为啥我们不能把这种事留给FBI来做 
Don't see why we can't just let the FBI do this.


1808
01:38:56.770 --> 01:38:58.860
你能信任他们所作出的结果吗？
You trust them with the results?

你状态很好 别紧张

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.310
这就是藏在幕后的感觉吗？
Is this what it's like behind the curtain?


1836
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:18.440
-理查德.朱维尔  -你好 
- Richard Jewell here. - Hello.


1837
01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:20.910
我们就快要求撤回报道了 
We're just about to go demand a retraction.


1838
01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:22.680
然后去吃汉堡包 你要不要一起？
Then we're gonna go get a hamburger. You wanna come?


1839
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:24.310
-是这样吗  -是啊 
- Is that right? - Yeah.


1840
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:27.120
这就像评分最高的科幻片 
This is, like, top-rate science fiction.


1841
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:29.280
《炸弹嫌疑人希望引人注目》
"Bomb suspect sought limelight."


1842
01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:32.190
你在开玩笑吗？你他妈算老几啊？
Are you kidding me? Who the hell do you think you are?


1843
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.330
布莱恩特先生 我做的就是报道事实 
Mr. Bryant, what I do is I report the facts.


1844
01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.450
-你误导公众 这是你做的  -我报道事实 
- You lead the public, is what you do. - I report the facts.


1845
01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:38.630
-事实？-对 报道事实是我的工作 
- The facts? - That's right That's what I do.


1846
01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.260
-你这个无知 傲慢 充满野心的…  -啥？啥？
- You ignorant, arrogant, ambitious... - Excuse me? Excuse me?


1847
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:44.100
这工作你怎么弄来的
How did you get this job?


1848
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:46.200
-我怎么弄来的工作？  -对啊
- How'd I get this job? - Yeah.


1849
01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.400
布莱恩特先生 如果你有问题 你可以去找联邦调查局处理
Mr. Bryant, if you have an issue, you can take it up with the FBI


1850
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:49.840
-去调查你的当事人  -哦 得了吧
- for investigating your client. - Oh, bullshit.


1851
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.280
这和我无关 不是吗
It has nothing to do with me. All right?


1852
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:53.910
我做的就是听到事实 再报道出来
What I do is, I hear the facts, I report them.


1853
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.880
-这是我的职责  -这些事实吗 那真相呢
- That is my responsibility. - The facts? What about the truth?


1854
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:58.220
我的原则是事实至上
My guiding principle is to report the facts.


1855
01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.480
什么见鬼的原则
What fucking principles?


1856
01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.550
对我来说原则这种东西是不顶用的
This isn't a principle standing next to me.


1857
01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:04.390
去你妈的原则 这个男的名字是理查德·朱维尔
Fuck your principle. This man's name is Richard Jewell.


1858
01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:06.660
-他是个英雄 他救了好多人 -你可真是满嘴跑火车
- He's a hero. He saved lives. - You're unbelievable


1859
01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.890
-到这来胡闹  -难道我是个骗子吗
- just coming in here. - I'm unbelievable?


1860
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.130
你知道你酿下多大的错吗
Do you have any idea what kind of wildfire you started?


1861
01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.370
你毁了他的生活
You've ruined this man's life.


1862
01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.800
-你或许应该向他道歉  -听着……
- Maybe you owe him an apology. - Listen...


1863
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:16.900
怎么样
How about that?


1864
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:20.310
-朱维尔先生  -你知道 你说啥
- Mr. Jewell... - You know, you are a... What?


1865
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:23.210
我说对于您和您母亲的遭遇我很同情
I said I'm sorry for what you and your mother have gone through.


1866
01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.040
你简直是垃圾记者中的战斗机
You are a miserable excuse for a journalist.


1867
01:41:26.150 --> 01:41:27.240
你就是个寄生虫
You're a parasite.


1868
01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.880
为了卖报 你啥都做得出来 你知道吗？
Anything to sell a goddamn paper, you know that?


1869
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:33.080
那你咋还不上医院呢
Why don't you go chase another ambulance?


1870
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:34.850
去你的
Kiss my ass.


1871
01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:39.990
他快不受控了
He's out of order.


1872
01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.120
都回去工作 这里没什么好看的
Vail can go back to work. There's nothing really to watch here.


1873
01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.000
继续忙你们的
You can just keep doing your jobs.


1874
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.480
不是他做的
He didn't do it.


1875
01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.820
哦 靠
Oh, fuck.


1876
01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:43.950
你特么真不要脸
You got a lot of fucking nerve sitting here.


1877
01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:45.650
朱维尔不可能打电话
Jewell couldn't have made the call.


1878
01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:47.790
时间距离不对
The math is wrong.


1879
01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:49.560
我去走了一遍
I covered the distance from the site to the phones.


1880
01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:52.030
他不可能及时来回
There's no way he would have made it in time.


1881
01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.400
是的 我们知道
Yeah, we know.


1882
01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:56.900
你们知道？
You know?


1883
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:59.170
他有帮凶
He had an accomplice.


1884
01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.130
帮凶？
An accomplice?


1885
01:43:01.210 --> 01:43:02.470
是啊 为什么不呢
Sure. Why not?


1886
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.840
那关于炸弹的档案呢
What about the lone bomber profile?


1887
01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.180
警察？帮凶？
The wannabe cop? With an accomplice?


1888
01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:11.580
首先 档案只是一个出发点
Well, first of all, profiles are always just a jumping-off point.


1889
01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:15.120
如果你记得的话 俄克拉荷马城就有两名投弹者
Oklahoma City had two bombers, if you remember.


1890
01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.060
所以 到底是谁干了这件事？究竟是谁呢
Okay, so who did it? Who is it?


1891
01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.960
好像你上次害了我之后我还会告诉你似的
Like I'm gonna tell you after the way you burned me.


1892
01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:24.460
好吧 我就只写针对朱维尔的案件进展开始舒缓
Fine. I'll just write that the case against Jewell is starting to weaken.


1893
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:27.160
证据不足等等 看情况说吧
Bad facts, et cetera. See how that goes.


1894
01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.860
你知道吗？我不确定你是从哪里想到这个主意的
You know what? I'm not sure where you get this idea


1895
01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:33.710
我为你想出来的 或者是我们一起
that I work for you, or that we work together.


1896
01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:36.980
我甚至都不知道为什么我要和你说话
I don't even know why I'm fucking talking to you.


1897
01:43:37.050 --> 01:43:39.570
我知道为什么 因为我们彼此相互依存
I know why. And you need me just as much as I need you.


1898
01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.380
你知道的 甜心
You know what, sweetheart?


1899
01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:44.780
我一点都不需要你
I don't need you a goddamn bit.


1900
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:58.030
再来一杯 谢谢
Can I have one more, please?


1901
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.730
在我身旁的是波比·朱维尔
Next to me is Bobi Jewell,


1902
01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:06.640
理查德·朱维尔的母亲
mother of Richard Jewell.


1903
01:44:08.010 --> 01:44:10.240
造化弄人
By some savage twist of fate,


1904
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:14.910
理查德·朱维尔被错误无理地指控犯有谋杀和故意伤害罪 
Richard Jewell has been wrongfully and falsely accused of murder and mayhem.


1905
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:20.920
她儿子的控告方是最有权势的两股力量
Her son's accusers are two of the most powerful forces in the world today.


1906
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:25.850
美国政府和美国媒体
The United States government and the media.


1907
01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:29.600
过去的四周里 这些可怖的势力勾结
For the past four weeks, these horrific forces have combined


1908
01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:33.290
令她处在水深火热之中
to make her daily existence a living hell.


1909
01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:38.430
就在我说话之时 他们还在继续压榨她
As I speak, they continue to crush the very life out of her


1910
01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.170
压榨她唯一的儿子
and her only son.


1911
01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.340
下面我将介绍芭芭拉·朱维尔
I introduce Barbara Jewell,


1912
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:46.950
世纪公园爆炸案的第113名受害者
the 113th victim of the Centennial bombing.


1913
01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:59.720
我的名字是芭芭拉·朱维尔
My name is Barbara Jewell.


1914
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.190
我受雇于当地一家保险公司 担任索赔协调员
I am employed as a claims coordinator with a local insurance agency


1915
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:07.790
我在那里工作了13年了
and I have worked there for 13 years.


1916
01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.470
大约在四周之前
Approximately four weeks ago,


1917
01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.540
超过100个人受伤
over 100 people were injured


1918
01:45:14.710 --> 01:45:16.740
两人死亡
and two people lost their lives


1919
01:45:18.110 --> 01:45:21.570
这是奥林匹克公园爆炸案的惨剧
as a result of the Olympic Park bombing.


1920
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:26.220
我非常担心那些受害者和他们的家庭
My heart goes out to these victims and their families.


1921
01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.420
我感到筋疲力尽
I am so very drained.


1922
01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:38.370
我向天祈祷 希望大家不会再遇此磨难
I hope and pray to God that nobody ever has to go through this again.


1923
01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.800
我想你们没有人
I do not think any of you can even


1924
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:44.600
能想象我们生活的现状
begin to imagine what our lives are like.


1925
01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.730
媒体把我儿子描绘成
The media has portrayed my son


1926
01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:53.810
一个犯罪分子
as the person who has committed this crime.


1927
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:58.910
他们窥探我们的隐私
They have taken all privacy from us.


1928
01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.480
打破了我们生活的宁静
They have taken all peace.


1929
01:46:03.130 --> 01:46:07.120
他们窥探记录我们的一切
They watch and photograph everything we do.


1930
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:10.020
就像这媒体
Like the media,


1931
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:14.460
联邦调查局盯着他的一举一动
the FBI follows his every move


1932
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.630
不断监视着我们家
and watches my home constantly.


1933
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:20.570
这是为什么
And why?


1934
01:46:21.710 --> 01:46:23.110
我的儿子
My son...


1935
01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:35.950
我的儿子是无辜的
My son is innocent.


1936
01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:41.590
理查德不是在奥林匹克公园放炸弹的人
Richard is not the Olympic Park bomber.


1937
01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:45.530
理查德不是凶手
Richard is not a murderer.


1938
01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:48.970
他救了人命
He saved people's lives.


1939
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:56.440
总统先生 请听听我的心声 帮帮我吧
Please hear me, Mr. President, and help me.


1940
01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:00.410
你有能力来结束这场噩梦
You have the power to end this nightmare.


1941
01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:03.580
我的儿子是个英雄
My son is a hero.


1942
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:08.050
我想联邦调查局直到现在才明白这件事
I think the FBI knows that by now.


1943
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:13.660
如果他们不再控诉我的儿子
If they do not intend to charge my son,


1944
01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.820
请告诉我们
please tell us.


1945
01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:18.960
请大声告诉世界
Please tell the world.


1946
01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.700
总统先生...
Mr. President...


1947
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:32.410
请还我儿子的清白
Please clear my son’s name.


1948
01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.040
你做的很棒
You did good.


1949
01:48:03.150 --> 01:48:04.240
理查德
Richard.


1950
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.680
妈妈
Oh, Mama.


1951
01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.980
非常感谢你做的这些
Oh, thank you for doing that.


1952
01:48:18.590 --> 01:48:20.120
噢 对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.


1953
01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.730
抱歉 对不起我哭了
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I cried.


1954
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.590
我并不想哭的
I didn't mean to cry.


1955
01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:27.900
不 真的很不错 真的很棒
No, you did real good. You did better than good.


1956
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.230
你准备好了吗
You ready?


1957
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:33.500
让他们瞧瞧你是谁
Let's go show them who you are.


1958
01:48:35.010 --> 01:48:36.000
我的天哪
Oh, God.


1959
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:38.610
万幸总算是结束了
I'm so glad that's over.


1960
01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:39.940
你做的不错
You did good.


1961
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:52.450
行了
All right.


1962
01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.040
先生们 请坐
Gentlemen, please have a seat.


1963
01:49:38.210 --> 01:49:39.400
我们马上就来
We'll be right with you.


1964
01:49:49.650 --> 01:49:51.090
行吧 我告诉你怎么弄
All right, let me tell you how it's gonna go.


1965
01:49:51.150 --> 01:49:54.490
他们会要求先见我 定一些规则
They're gonna ask to see me first, set the ground rules.


1966
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:57.580
我想确保他们知道我不是同性恋
I wanna make sure they know I'm not gay.


1967
01:49:59.730 --> 01:50:02.790
理查德 我认为我们要更重要的事儿要说
Richard, I think we got bigger fish to fry,


1968
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:05.660
但是你仍有机会告诉他们这个
but you'll get the chance to tell them that.


1969
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:07.200
我确定
I'm sure.


1970
01:50:09.570 --> 01:50:10.900
肖恩探员
Agent Shaw.


1971
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.080
你敢不敢去看他有没有士力架
Dare you to see if he's got any Snickers.


1972
01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:27.010
有点饿了
Kind of hungry.


1973
01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:30.890
你知道基本规则是什么吧 雷达
You know what a 1001 is, Radar?


1974
01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.020
是的先生 对联邦探员撒谎
Yes, sir. It's lying to a federal agent


1975
01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:36.160
这是重罪
It's a felony.


1976
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:38.960
如果你谎话连篇
You say anything in there that isn't true,


1977
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:41.560
他们不用证明你是个炸弹手就可以把你关进监狱
they can put you in jail without ever proving you're a bomber.


1978
01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:42.470
嗨
Hey.


1979
01:50:43.710 --> 01:50:46.110
不知道说什么就保持沉默
You don't know what to say, you say nothing.


1980
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:49.300
你要求五分钟的休息时间 来和我商量一下
You ask for a five-minute break, you consult with me.


1981
01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.410
你不能即兴发挥
You do not improvise.


1982
01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:52.610
明白了吗
You got that?


1983
01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.070
明白
Yes, sir.


1984
01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:57.710
所以 如果你不知道说什么 你该怎么做
So if you don't know what to say, what do you do?


1985
01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.450
-我就啥也不说  -没错
- I don't say a damn thi - That's right


1986
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.550
布莱恩特先生
Mr. Bryant?


1987
01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:22.430
需要帮忙吗？
Can I help you?


1988
01:51:22.610 --> 01:51:25.080
我只是随便看看
I was taking a look.


1989
01:51:31.290 --> 01:51:33.050
你们准备怎么办？
How do you guys wanna handle this?


1990
01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.780
我们提问 你们回答
We're gonna ask you some questions, and you're gonna give us some answers.


1991
01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:39.050
这怎么样
How's that sound?


1992
01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.450
好的
Okay.


1993
01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.430
听起来不错
Sounds good.


1994
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:45.560
我去叫他来
I'll go get him.


1995
01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.870
嗨 你准备好了吗
Hey, you ready, boyo?


1996
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:49.900
是的
Yeah.


1997
01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.200
应该好了
I think so. Yeah.


1998
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:52.370
不 你要完全准备好
No, I mean ready.


1999
01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:55.710
你们不是探员和犯人的关系进行谈话 而是警察对警察
Look at these guys not as suspect to agent, but as cop to cop.


2000
01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:57.940
别过分尊重他们
Don't give them any more deference than they're due.


2001
01:51:58.050 --> 01:52:00.520
-也别总叫他们“警官”  -好
- And don't keep calling them "sir." - Yeah, well,


2002
01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.710
但他们可是美国政府啊
they're still the United States government.


2003
01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:04.510
不 他们可不是美国政府
No, they aren't the United States government


2004
01:52:04.590 --> 01:52:06.950
他们只是三个为美国政府工作的混蛋
They're just three pricks who work for the United States government


2005
01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.110
明白这区别吗？
You understand the difference?


2006
01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:11.590
这个房间里没人能比得上你
Nobody in that room is a better man than you.


2007
01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:12.920
明白吗？
You understand?


2008
01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:14.620
来吧
Come on.


2009
01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:16.230
你会没事的
You'll be fine.


2010
01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:23.300
就这儿 坐这儿
That's it Sit right there.


2011
01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:24.760
这儿？
Right here?


2012
01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:25.830
对
Yeah.


2013
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:37.250
感谢你配合我们调查
Thank you for joining us.


2014
01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:40.080
朱维尔先生 我们有一些问题想问你
Uh, Mr. Jewell, we've got a few questions


2015
01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.090
是关于1996年7月27日发生的事
regarding the events of July 27th, 1996,


2016
01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:44.590
你可能知道
as you probably know.


2017
01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:47.630
具体来说就是世纪公园发生的爆炸案
Specifically the bombing in Centennial Park.


2018
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.690
朱维尔先生 你是否
Mr. Jewell, you ever find yourself


2019
01:52:56.870 --> 01:53:01.540
登陆过一个名为糖果宝贝的糖果乐园的网站
accessing an Internet site called Candyman's Candyland


2020
01:53:01.710 --> 01:53:05.540
浏览过无政府主义者食谱的内容？
regarding the contents of The Anarchist Cookbook?


2021
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:07.850
不 我没有
No, I have not.


2022
01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.540
但你确实接受过处理爆炸物的警务训练对吗？
But you do have police training in handling explosives?


2023
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:13.580
已问已答 不得追问
Asked and answered.


2024
01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:16.010
你有收集世纪公园建筑上的
Did you ever collect any pieces of pipe


2025
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.720
任何碎片吗？
from the construction of Centennial Park?


2026
01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.590
不 我没有
No, I did not.


2027
01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:25.900
你有跟在公园的任何人说过
Do you remember telling anybody at the park,


2028
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:29.330
“快给我拍张照吧 因为我马上就要出名了”这句话吗？
"Take my picture now, because pretty soon I'm gonna be famous"?


2029
01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:31.000
没有
No, sir.


2030
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:32.330
真的吗？
Really?


2031
01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.040
你确定吗？
You sure about that?


2032
01:53:35.010 --> 01:53:36.500
百分百确定

2033
01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.770
那么你有说过
How about, did you say,


2034
01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:42.840
“我正在去亚特兰大的路上 外面肯定会一团糟”这句话吗？
"I'm on my way to Atlanta It's gonna be a mess out there"?


2035
01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:46.210
我是指交通堵塞
I was referring to the traffic jams.


2036
01:53:47.690 --> 01:53:49.020
朱维尔先生
Mr. Jewell,


2037
01:53:49.290 --> 01:53:53.350
为什么你特别要求要在声光塔舞台那儿站岗？
why specifically did you want to be stationed at that sound and light tower?


2038
01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:57.030
我只是喜欢听音乐
I just liked listening to the music


2039
01:53:57.770 --> 01:54:00.100
而且 在前一天晚上 我带我妈妈去了
and, the night before, I got to bring my mama down.


2040
01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:03.330
我们想听肯尼.罗杰斯表演
We got to listen to Kenny Rogers.


2041
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:06.100
她很喜欢 歌很棒
She liked that. That was nice.


2042
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:10.810
而且我还有个很老套的理由
And I guess I also get a nice vantage point


2043
01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:13.580
我想看美女
to take a look at all the pretty girls.


2044
01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:16.910
我不是同性恋
I am not a homosexual.


2045
01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.120
大卫.达奇斯也不是
And neither is David Dutchess.


2046
01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.950
所以你和大卫.达奇斯不是一对儿？
So you and David Dutchess are not lovers?


2047
01:54:23.290 --> 01:54:24.350
已问已答 不得追问
Asked and answered.


2048
01:54:26.130 --> 01:54:28.030
朱维尔先生 你说过
Mr. Jewell, you said before


2049
01:54:28.230 --> 01:54:30.630
在你从舞台到声光塔
that in your comings and goings back and forth


2050
01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.390
来来回回的过程中
from the stage to the tower


2051
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:36.200
你记不清具体时间了 对吗？
that you couldn't get an exact fix on the time. Is that correct?


2052
01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.180
对 但当你想上厕所的时候
Yes, but when you have the runs,


2053
01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.340
我也确实上了 抱歉
which I did, excuse me,


2054
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:46.670
你不会去注意时间
you're not thinking about what time it is.


2055
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:48.980
你只是想
You're just trying to


2056
01:54:50.190 --> 01:54:52.710
横冲直撞到厕所 知道吗？
crab-walk to a bathroom, you know?


2057
01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:55.750
所以你不记得
So you don't remember the exact time


2058
01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.260
你看见醉鬼们往塔上扔瓶子的具体时间？
that you saw the drunks throwing the beer cans against the tower?


2059
01:54:59.430 --> 01:55:00.330
对吗？
Right?


2060
01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:02.560
没错
No.


2061
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.660
你不记得第一次看见背包的具体时间？
You don't remember the exact time you first saw the backpack?


2062
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:07.730
没错
That's correct.


2063
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:10.340
你以前见过那样的背包吗 朱维尔先生？
You ever seen a backpack like that before, Mr. Jewell?


2064
01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:13.100
我应该见过
Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah.


2065
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.840
你见过那个背包吗 朱维尔先生？
You ever see that specific backpack before, Mr. Jewell?


2066
01:55:16.110 --> 01:55:17.080
已问已答 不得追问
Asked and answered.


2067
01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:18.110
我们能往下进行吗？
Can we move on?


2068
01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.470
朱维尔先生...
Mr. Jewell...


2069
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:24.010
你有和大卫.达奇斯或其他同谋
Did you conspire with David Dutchess or anybody else


2070
01:55:24.190 --> 01:55:27.250
在世纪公园放置炸弹吗？
to plant a bomb in Centennial Park?


2071
01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:41.190
没有
No.


2072
01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:44.960
那你是怎么知道在塔的另一头
Then how the fuck did you know to be on the other side of that AT&T tower


2073
01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.170
是可以躲避爆炸攻击的？
where you knew you'd be protected from the blast?


2074
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:50.280
一颗炸弹正好就在你站岗的地方爆炸
A bomb went off right where you were stationed.


2075
01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.410
搞得一片混乱 人们倒在地上
Chaos erupts. Bodies hit the ground.


2076
01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.350
警察被炸飞 妈的 我就是其中一个
Cops go flying. Hell, I was one of them.


2077
01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:56.980
你却毫发无伤
You come out without a goddamn scratch.


2078
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:58.640
这是怎么回事儿 理查德？
How does that happen, Richard?


2079
01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:09.020
我能问你们一个问题吗？
Can I ask all you fellas a question?


2080
01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:11.120
天啊 什么问题？
Jesus. What?


2081
01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:17.330
你要指控我犯了什么罪吗？
Do you have any kind of case against me?


2082
01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:20.800
我是指证据
I mean evidence.


2083
01:56:21.010 --> 01:56:26.310
就像是 在我妈妈的特百惠里发现了任何蛛丝马迹？
Like, any traces of anything on my mama's Tupperware?


2084
01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:31.950
或在她的公寓里发现了任何制造炸弹的材料？
Or did you find any bomb-making materials in her apartment?


2085
01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.320
你有发现任何  -嘿 嘿 嘿
did you find some- - Hey, hey. Hey.


2086
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:35.980
理查德 我们不需要主动-
Richard, we don't need to volunteer-


2087
01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:38.420
如果我还要回答其他的 我必须先把这些话说了
I'm gonna say this if I'm gonna say anything.


2088
01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:43.900
我走进来 看到你们窗户上的圆形图案
I walk in here and I look at the circle decal on your windows there,


2089
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.430
然后我就想...
and I'm thinking...


2090
01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:49.760
我曾经以为联邦执法部门
I... I used to think that federal law enforcement


2091
01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.830
是一个人渴求的最高使命了吧
was just about the highest calling a person could aspire to.


2092
01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:57.210
但我不确定现在是否还这么想 你知道吗？
And I'm not sure I think that anymore, you know?


2093
01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:58.680
特别是这一切发生之后
Not after all this.


2094
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:03.610
那天晚上我只是尽了职责
I did my job that night,


2095
01:57:03.690 --> 01:57:06.620
也因此让一些人幸免遇难
and some people are alive because of that.


2096
01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:10.550
你觉得下次安保人员
Do you think that the next time some security guard


2097
01:57:10.630 --> 01:57:12.390
再看到可疑包裹时
sees a suspicious package,


2098
01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:15.060
他或她还会上报吗？
that he or she's gonna call it in?


2099
01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.090
我不觉得
I doubt it.


2100
01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:20.290
你知道吗？因为他们会看着它然后想
You know? 'Cause they're gonna look at that and they're gonna think,


2101
01:57:20.770 --> 01:57:23.290
“我可不想成为下一个理查德.朱维尔...
"I don't wanna be another Richard Jewell...


2102
01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:25.100
所以我还是赶紧跑吧”
So I'm just gonna run."


2103
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:29.780
这怎么能保人安全呢
How's that make anybody any safer?


2104
01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.650
你们可以继续咬着我不放
Y'all can keep following me around some more


2105
01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:36.880
做你们现在做的 我能忍受
doing what you're doing. I can stand it.


2106
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:40.480
但是我知道 你们在我身上浪费的每一秒
But I just know that every second you spend on me


2107
01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:43.020
本可以花在寻找真正的凶手上
is time that you're not spending on the real guy who did it,


2108
01:57:43.090 --> 01:57:44.680
就像沃森说的...
and it's like Watson said...


2109
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:49.020
要是他...
What happens when he...


2110
01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:54.030
要是他又作案了该怎么办？
What happens when he does it again?


2111
01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:08.550
所以 你有任何证据来指控我吗？
So, do you have anything you wanna charge me with?


2112
01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.750
你有证据吗？
Can you?


2113
01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:27.590
好吧...
Well...


2114
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.770
我觉得我们该走了
I think it's time to go.


2115
01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.230
怎么样？
How'd he do?


2116
01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:04.640
他表现的好极了
He did great.


2117
01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:08.670

太好了
Go on.


2120
01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:23.110

这是个好的开始
Well, this is a good start.

2133

布莱恩特先生 让我把话说清楚

Is it really over or is this just another one of their things?
