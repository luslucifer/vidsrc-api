1
00:01:24.427 --> 00:01:26.258
Look at us.

2
00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:29.122
Running around,

3
00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:33.759
always rushed, always late.

4
00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:38.334
I guess that's why they call it
the human race.


5
00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:42.703
What we crave most in this world
is connection.


6
00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:46.014
And for some people,
it happens at first sight.


7
00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.242
It's when you know, you know.

8
00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.551
It's fate working its magic.

9
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.222
And that's great for them.

10
00:01:56.693 --> 00:01:59.025
They get to live in a pop song.

11
00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:01.490
Ride the express train.

12
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.792
But that's not the way it really works.

13
00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:15.368
For the rest of us,
it's a bit less romantic.


14
00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:18.810
It's complicated and it's messy.

15
00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:22.816
It's about horrible timing
and fumbled opportunities


16
00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:27.548
and not being able to say
what you need to say


17
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.885
when you need to say it.

18
00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:33.590
At least, that's the
way it was for me.

19
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:39.361
Taxi. Taxi driver. 
Taxi, taxi, taxi, taxi.

20
00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:42.960
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.


21
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.909
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.


22
00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:50.069
Fat, pedaling--
Fat, pedaling, hooker-looking bitch.


23
00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:53.580
Pig-faced--
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.


24
00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.479
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.

25
00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.217
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.


26
00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:03.848
I got a pig-faced--
Pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama.


27
00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:07.451
I've got a pig-faced, gimpy, limping mama
limping on by.


28
00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:10.327
Pig-faced-
- I've got a pig-faced--

29
00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:13.060
Man-boy. Little man-boy.
Beady-eyed little man-boy.


30
00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:15.899
Beady-eyed little--
Beady-eyed little man-boy.


31
00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.065
I see a beady-eyed little man-boy.

32
00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.507
Beady-eyed-
- Beady-eyed little man-boy.

33
00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:25.478
I see a beady-eyed--
Beady-eyed little man-boy looking at me.


34
00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:28.812
I got a beady-eyed little man-boy.
Beady-eyed little man-boy.


35
00:03:28.952 --> 00:03:31.284
Beady-eyed little man-boy
looking at me.


36
00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.249
I'm sorry about that.
You did say that was true.


37
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.392
Sorry.

38
00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:58.045
You are not
a beady-eyed little man-child.


39
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.445
"Boy," he distinctly said, okay?
And that's worse.


40
00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:03.518
And I am, I'm like a--
I'm a beady-eyed-looking little man-boy


41
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.280
that shouldn't be wearing sweater vests.

42
00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:07.412
He was mentally ill,
standing on a street corner.


43
00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:09.718
Kassie, exactly.
He had no reason to be polite, okay?


44
00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.521
It was like a Tourette's-style
truth-serum affliction this guy had,


45
00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:14.186
and I was caught in the cross hairs.

46
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.355
- I can't believe this stuff bothers you.
- It does.


47
00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:18.831
Now, I have some big news.
I wanna show you something.


48
00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:20.902
First I wanna show you something.
Check this out.


49
00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:22.664
- Look at that.
- What? What is that?


50
00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:25.299
I seem to have a growth.

51
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:27.909
Oh, my God, is that your scrotum?

52
00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:31.172
- It's not a sunset.
- Ugh. You're exhausting.


53
00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:33.509
My health exhausts you?

54
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.483
- Fine, we'll deal with my death later.
- My turn.


55
00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:37.677
- See this?
- Yeah.


56
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.721
That's the dollar in yen.
I bought in a week ago.


57
00:04:40.857 --> 00:04:44.486
- Good for you. Now look at it like this.
- Yeah, sideways.


58
00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:47.596
If someone you knew owned this stock
what advice would you give them?


59
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:51.057
I don't know, Kassie. I gotta look
at fundamentals, you know, P/E ratios.


60
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.033
- Simple, simple. Hold or sell?
- You gotta sell that, it's going down.


61
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.262
Exactly.

62
00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:58.465
This, Wally, this is what a woman's fertility
looks like after a certain age.


63
00:04:58.608 --> 00:04:59.666
So?

64
00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:02.107
So I would like you
to be the first to know


65
00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.007
I'm having a baby.

66
00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:09.749
- You're pregnant?
- No, not yet. But I'm working on it.


67
00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:13.447
Went to the doctor, she said all my levels
were really great, considering.


68
00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.616
And, uh, she said that my cervical mucus
is gorgeous, by the way.


69
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.318
- Thanks for that.
- And, uh...


70
00:05:19.462 --> 00:05:21.555
Then she started giving me this lecture
about my age,


71
00:05:21.698 --> 00:05:24.223
and I was really starting to hear her
about timing and why wait?


72
00:05:25.568 --> 00:05:28.093
And, you know, I started--

73
00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:30.637
Would you please stop having sex
with food?


74
00:05:31.407 --> 00:05:33.204
Sorry, you know I don't know
when I do it.


75
00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:35.436
And then I thought to myself,
"I can do this."


76
00:05:35.578 --> 00:05:38.479
I've got a, you know,
killer new job at the network,


77
00:05:38.614 --> 00:05:40.275
and I don't need a
man to have a baby.

78
00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:42.748
Technically speaking, you do.
Where's all this coming from?


79
00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:43.943
Is this about Paul?

80
00:05:44.087 --> 00:05:48.023
Why don't you chalk it up as another of
your disastrous flameouts and move on?


81
00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:50.057
This has absolutely nothing to do
with Paul.


82
00:05:50.193 --> 00:05:52.320
- I think it does.
- And thank you for bringing it up.


83
00:05:52.462 --> 00:05:54.487
All I'm saying is
don't kick that can down the road.


84
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.758
You need to look at your relationships
instead of biting off the next step.


85
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.629
- Deal with the one before.
- You know what?


86
00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:02.829
I'm just tired of thinking about
how this is supposed to go, all right?


87
00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:04.599
I'm just ready to do it now.

88
00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:06.732
- Really?
- Life is in session.


89
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.803
- Is that from an infomercial?
- No.


90
00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:11.004
- Really?
- Yes.


91
00:06:11.147 --> 00:06:12.375
- Did you buy the DvD?
- One.


92
00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:15.313
But it really was something
that resonated with me.


93
00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:18.318
Wally, I don't--
You know what? I'm gonna do this.


94
00:06:18.454 --> 00:06:24.222
I want to have a kid,
and I am in the market for some...


95
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.021
...semen.

96
00:06:26.562 --> 00:06:28.029
And...

97
00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:31.459
And?

98
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.100
I need you to help me find some.

99
00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.947
So, what, are you gonna, like,
use a service?


100
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:47.345
You gonna read résumés?
You know, all that stuff is crap.


101
00:06:47.483 --> 00:06:48.916
I heard about this woman in Queens,

102
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:51.485
she thought she was buying the sperm
of an Ivy League athlete,


103
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:53.145
turned out it came
from a homeless guy.


104
00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:54.950
Oh, you did not hear that.

105
00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:57.553
Kid turned out homeless.
She tried to sue and she lost.


106
00:06:57.693 --> 00:06:59.786
You just made all of that up.

107
00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:01.897
- Did I?
- Why are you even on this train?


108
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:04.761
Because we're not nearly done talking
about this.


109
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:06.493
Wally, you're a vortex.

110
00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:09.935
I have four interviews this week,
one of which I'm prepared for, okay?


111
00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:13.166
Listen. Now, what's wrong with my sperm,
by the way?


112
00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:18.972
- With your sperm?
- It works.


113
00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:20.810
Nothing.

114
00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:24.543
- I'm sure you have killer sperm.
- You're damn right.


115
00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:27.815
But, you know, we're best friends.
Isn't that weird? That'd be weird.


116
00:07:27.957 --> 00:07:29.686
- It is weird, you're right.
- That's weird.


117
00:07:29.826 --> 00:07:31.885
- You know what else? How do I put this?
- Careful.


118
00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:34.588
- You're a little neurotic, you know?
- I see.


119
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.221
- Little self-absorbed and pessimistic.
- I got it.


120
00:07:37.366 --> 00:07:39.425
And I'm not pessimistic, sorry,
I'm a realist.


121
00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:41.503
- Big difference.
- Wally, this is not about you.


122
00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:43.537
And whether you can deal with this
or not--


123
00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:45.300
- Excuse me.
- Please don't say it.


124
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:47.568
--life's in session.

125
00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:53.714
She wouldn't know good
sperm if it slapped her in the face. Ugh.


126
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.442
What does she take you for, a eunuch?

127
00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:57.746
- You're jealous. It's perfectly normal.
- No, I'm not.


128
00:07:57.887 --> 00:08:00.412
This is bigtime primal stuff
you're dealing with, jungle stuff,


129
00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:02.046
and you have every right to be upset.

130
00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:04.785
She put you in the friend zone
six years ago, brother.


131
00:08:04.927 --> 00:08:06.417
That's a cold and inhospitable place

132
00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:08.291
where your manhood
is an endangered species.


133
00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.229
And now we're talking about your seed
getting devalued by her.


134
00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:14.302
Hey, so that we're clear,
she did not put me in the friend zone.


135
00:08:14.437 --> 00:08:16.462
We put each other in the friend zone.
It was mutual.


136
00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:17.868
Let's be honest with ourselves.

137
00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:19.372
You had your window with Kassie,

138
00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:21.534
and you went all Wally on her
and you doomed it.


139
00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:24.043
I went what?
Hey, what is that even supposed to mean?


140
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.614
You shared too much too soon.
Quickest way to kill a romance.


141
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:29.013
You gotta hide the crazy
at least through the appetizers.


142
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:30.846
I see. So just so that I'm clear,

143
00:08:30.987 --> 00:08:33.512
which one of your three failed marriages
taught you that lesson?


144
00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:35.419
All three,
in their special and various ways.


145
00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:38.789
Exactly, so, okay,
I appreciate the kind advice, but I'm fine.


146
00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:39.986
- Are you? Are you?
- Yeah.


147
00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:43.360
Because I still don't know why the hell
you e-mailed me a picture of your armpit.


148
00:08:43.499 --> 00:08:46.696
I told you that I thought I had a growth.
And was it an armpit?


149
00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:48.929
Oh, golly, I hope so.

150
00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:55.978
- She's really ambitious, huh?
- I didn't think she was interested.


151
00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:58.603
Please tell me you didn't invite Wally.

152
00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:02.616
- Of course I did.
- Is he bringing that Internet girl?


153
00:09:02.752 --> 00:09:04.982
- No, she broke up with him.
- Shocker.


154
00:09:05.121 --> 00:09:08.454
Do you know I've had orgasms
that last longer than his relationships?


155
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:11.082
Would you stop? Sorry.

156
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.020
Okay, here are your talking points,
minister.


157
00:09:14.163 --> 00:09:17.360
Listen, I know that Wally
can be a bit blunt,


158
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.162
but at least he tells it like it is,
you know what I mean?


159
00:09:20.303 --> 00:09:23.534
It's like when things get too intimate,
he gets-- He walls up.


160
00:09:23.673 --> 00:09:28.076
But nobody-- There's nobody I trust more.
I mean, he always has my back.


161
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.438
Yeah, I get it, Kass.

162
00:09:29.579 --> 00:09:33.208
He's your BFF, he's a really good guy.
Totally undatable.


163
00:09:33.349 --> 00:09:36.375
Nobody is totally undatable. Come on.

164
00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:39.784
I mean, there's gotta be somebody
out there for him.


165
00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:43.352
Done.

166
00:09:44.193 --> 00:09:46.718
- Places.
- I hope this party doesn't suck.


167
00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:50.425
- Yup.
- All right.


168
00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:52.796
- You should have gotten Debbie a gift.
- Oh, come on.


169
00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:55.062
It's her 30th birthday.
She's really vulnerable.


170
00:09:55.204 --> 00:09:57.968
Pretending it's actually her 30th
is gonna be my gift to that old bag.


171
00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:00.468
Hey, so here's where I'm at.

172
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.044
So I want a donor that I can meet,
you know?


173
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:04.874
I want someone
whose eyes I can look into.


174
00:10:05.014 --> 00:10:07.278
I wanna be able to, you know,
shake his hand.


175
00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:09.907
And you can't do that
at a sperm bank, right?


176
00:10:10.052 --> 00:10:13.613
I also want it fresh, you know?
I don't really-- I don't think I want it frozen.


177
00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:16.384
- Who wants frozen?
- Frozen's so refreshing, though.


178
00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:19.487
What kind of qualities
would you be shopping for?


179
00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:23.030
Uh, sense of humor is most important.

180
00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:27.061
Why do women always say that sense of
humor is always the most important thing?


181
00:10:27.203 --> 00:10:28.727
We all know that that's a lie.

182
00:10:29.605 --> 00:10:33.439
- Okay, so then height.
- No.


183
00:10:33.576 --> 00:10:37.512
But, you know, funny height.
Funny height.


184
00:10:52.028 --> 00:10:54.553
Come on, Wally Mars,
aren't you gonna dance with me?


185
00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:57.359
No, I'm not, birthday girl.

186
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.197
- I'm not really feeling it tonight, you know?
- You are such a buzzkill.


187
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.798
I don't wanna break your flow.

188
00:11:02.938 --> 00:11:05.065
You were doing a great job
of killing it over there.


189
00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:08.404
You dressed up for my party.
That's so nice.


190
00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:10.375
- You're welcome.
- Stripes.


191
00:11:12.448 --> 00:11:15.008
Okay, who's dancing with me?

192
00:11:16.018 --> 00:11:17.417
Just perfect. Ha, ha.

193
00:11:19.588 --> 00:11:22.386
Sounds good. It's a funny horror film?

194
00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:24.993
Well, it's a horror film meets, uh...

195
00:11:25.127 --> 00:11:28.585
Well, they haven't really made
an honest kickboxing film yet.


196
00:11:29.265 --> 00:11:30.596
That's so true.

197
00:11:30.733 --> 00:11:33.861
I hadn't thought about that,
but you're absolutely right.


198
00:11:34.003 --> 00:11:37.063
- That's--
- Hi. I'm bored. Let's get a kebab.


199
00:11:37.206 --> 00:11:41.870
Wally, this is Declan.
He's a, uh, writer-slash-director.


200
00:11:42.011 --> 00:11:43.842
- Hey, double threat.
- Hey, Wally.


201
00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:46.277
- This is one of my oldest friends.
- That's right.


202
00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.610
- He's an equities analyst. Ha, ha.
- Analyst.


203
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:50.776
- Seriously, come with me.
- I think I'm gonna stay.


204
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.978
- I don't think so.
- What?


205
00:11:52.121 --> 00:11:55.056
Hey, Wally, you, uh,
got any great stock tips for me?


206
00:11:55.191 --> 00:11:57.853
Oh, Declan, they're all, you know,
they're all going straight up.


207
00:11:57.993 --> 00:12:00.518
You want some free advice?
Go on margin, go strong, go long.


208
00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:02.062
- Let's do it.
- Go strong, go long?


209
00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:03.256
- That's right.
- Really?


210
00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:04.923
- Yup.
- You always tell me to get out.


211
00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:07.900
- Changed my mind. Let's go, one second.
- Short and fast.


212
00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:10.405
Oh, boy, you see that?
You just got finger-gunned.


213
00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:12.439
I heard it.

214
00:12:12.742 --> 00:12:13.542
- Come on. Please?
- Oh, God, what?


215
00:12:13.542 --> 00:12:16.477
- Come on. Please?
- Oh, God, what?


216
00:12:16.612 --> 00:12:19.342
- He's married.
- Divorced.


217
00:12:19.482 --> 00:12:21.609
- Then he's lying.
- How do you know that?


218
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:24.049
There's a tan line on his finger
where his ring should be.


219
00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:25.244
What?

220
00:12:25.387 --> 00:12:27.412
You're not thinking of this guy
as a donor, are you?


221
00:12:27.556 --> 00:12:30.889
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know. I still might do it.


222
00:12:31.026 --> 00:12:33.859
What are you talking about?
Wait a sec, are you out of your mind?


223
00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:36.362
You're gonna let Captain Douche
be the father of your child?


224
00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:38.524
- That just locks it up for you?
- I don't know yet.


225
00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:39.998
All right.

226
00:12:41.403 --> 00:12:44.668
- I'll tell you what, you're on your own.
- Oh, yeah, okay.


227
00:12:53.582 --> 00:12:55.243
Okay.

228
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:00.818
Wally.

229
00:13:01.557 --> 00:13:03.855
Wally. Wally!

230
00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:06.953
Wally!

231
00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:12.831
Declan, Declan, hey.

232
00:13:12.968 --> 00:13:14.629
Kassie left.

233
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.761
- What?
- Yeah, Kassie had to go.


234
00:13:16.906 --> 00:13:18.134
Where?

235
00:13:18.274 --> 00:13:20.105
She had to go
to her dealer's house, okay?


236
00:13:20.242 --> 00:13:22.767
This guy's a little bit of a paranoid,
so she went by herself.


237
00:13:22.912 --> 00:13:24.470
She's gone to go pick up some drugs.

238
00:13:24.613 --> 00:13:27.844
Some ecstasy, bro,
and some viagra, all right?


239
00:13:27.983 --> 00:13:29.974
And she digs you.

240
00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.883
- Ha, ha. She digs me.
- You bet your ass she digs you. It's on.


241
00:13:33.022 --> 00:13:36.014
It's on like "Donkey Kong," is actually
what she wanted me to say to you.


242
00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:39.616
Now, this is the address of the love shack,
and you gotta go right now.


243
00:13:39.762 --> 00:13:43.926
Go, seriously.
Establish a safe word too, okay?


244
00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:48.395
Wally! Come on.

245
00:13:48.737 --> 00:13:51.501
I cannot--
You sent him to Washington Heights?


246
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.608
Yeah, Harlem's too gentrified.
I had to go higher.


247
00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:56.643
Wasn't even gonna go through with it.
It was just an idea.


248
00:13:56.779 --> 00:13:59.179
You know, I wanted to let it breathe.

249
00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:01.579
God, what's wrong--?
Why have you been so weird lately?


250
00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:03.116
- I haven't.
- Yeah, you have.


251
00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:05.413
- I don't think you should do it, you know.
- What?


252
00:14:05.554 --> 00:14:07.317
- The whole baby thing, all right?
- Stop it.


253
00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:09.583
- It's not right, it's not natural.
- Wally, stop.


254
00:14:09.725 --> 00:14:12.956
What if you meet someone tomorrow,
all right?


255
00:14:13.095 --> 00:14:14.255
Or like six months from now.

256
00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:17.991
You guys fall in love,
and by the time you realize it, it's too late.


257
00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:20.328
Why is this so
hard for you to accept?

258
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.337
Look, I'm not going to wait around

259
00:14:22.471 --> 00:14:25.338
for some version of this
that might never happen, okay?


260
00:14:25.474 --> 00:14:27.203
Look, this wasn't my plan either.

261
00:14:27.343 --> 00:14:29.311
I didn't grow up in Minnesota
dreaming of the day


262
00:14:29.445 --> 00:14:32.972
that I was gonna put an ad out
for a sperm donor on Craigslist.


263
00:14:33.115 --> 00:14:36.278
But I'm here and it's happening
and it's scary, and I can't count on you?


264
00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.479
I can't ask for your support without you
just spewing out constant judgments?


265
00:14:40.956 --> 00:14:42.821
You're supposed to be my friend.

266
00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.518
Well, yeah.

267
00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:55.363
I think we should take some time.

268
00:14:55.504 --> 00:14:57.369
I think we need a timeout.

269
00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.371
Already learning
how to speak Mommy, huh?


270
00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:06.641
Wow. Taxi.

271
00:15:08.083 --> 00:15:09.482
See you later.

272
00:15:15.524 --> 00:15:19.051
I'm not just your friend.
Debbie Epstein's your friend.


273
00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:27.727
Look at you. Somebody chasing you?

274
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.834
- Dude.
- Yup.


275
00:15:32.074 --> 00:15:35.100
- Let me guess, Kassie issues?
- No, no, there's no issue.


276
00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:36.905
We haven't seen each other for a week.

277
00:15:37.046 --> 00:15:38.809
- She says we're on a timeout.
- Timeout?


278
00:15:38.948 --> 00:15:40.540
- Yeah.
- Timeout?


279
00:15:40.683 --> 00:15:43.208
What are you, 6?
You didn't share your animal crackers?


280
00:15:43.352 --> 00:15:44.649
Grown-ups don't go on timeouts.

281
00:15:44.787 --> 00:15:47.051
Grown-ups have sex
with their lady friends, Mars.


282
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:51.285
Okay, you're eating a chocolate bar
on two.


283
00:15:51.427 --> 00:15:54.521
It's not on two. It's certainly not on two.
And I needed just a little energy.


284
00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:56.358
- And I'm in the fat-burning zone.
- Right.


285
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.160
You're burning muscle.
This is how you burn fat.


286
00:17:07.136 --> 00:17:10.401
- Aloha. Ha, ha.
- Hi. Oh, ha, ha.


287
00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:12.370
So sweet.

288
00:17:14.043 --> 00:17:16.910
Can I just do it then?
You're busy. Okay?


289
00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:21.449
Well, this is confusing.
One more of these. I got it.


290
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.347
Cool if I did this by myself?
Picking up on your eyes.


291
00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:26.920
- Hey, Wally, want me to top off?
- Hi. No, thanks, I'm good.


292
00:17:27.056 --> 00:17:28.284
- Some bubbly?
- No, thank you.


293
00:17:28.424 --> 00:17:30.153
I'm gonna stick
with the hard stuff tonight.


294
00:17:30.292 --> 00:17:32.692
Hey, so who does this?
A party for insemination?


295
00:17:32.828 --> 00:17:36.457
- Is there even a doctor here, Debbie?
- Yes, Dr. Orensen.


296
00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:41.598
That guy?
Does he, like, practice out of a camper?


297
00:17:41.737 --> 00:17:43.329
He's progressive.

298
00:17:43.705 --> 00:17:47.197
This whole night was my idea.
It's how everybody's doing it these days.


299
00:17:47.342 --> 00:17:50.436
And Kassie's gonna go in the other room,
we're all gonna leave,


300
00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:54.777
and she's gonna, like,
do the deed with this big baster.


301
00:17:55.217 --> 00:17:57.685
Shouldn't that be cleaned
or something?


302
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.220
- Why is it up here?
- I'm messing with you.


303
00:18:00.355 --> 00:18:02.220
- Oh.
- Ha, ha. Wally, you're so funny.


304
00:18:02.357 --> 00:18:03.847
Debbie, knock that off.

305
00:18:03.992 --> 00:18:05.323
She's gonna use a medical device.

306
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:07.429
But, you know,
it's basically the same thing.


307
00:18:07.563 --> 00:18:09.224
- It goes in and out.
- Mm-hm.


308
00:18:09.832 --> 00:18:11.493
Charming.

309
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:15.069
Wally, what is wrong with you?
You have, like, this negative--


310
00:18:15.204 --> 00:18:18.298
All these negative ions
that pop off like fleas.


311
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.841
- Here, try this, it'll make you less anxious.
- What's this?


312
00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:24.309
I stole them from my mother.

313
00:18:24.847 --> 00:18:26.678
They're herbal.

314
00:18:27.349 --> 00:18:30.147
But they might as well
be pharmaceutical.


315
00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:34.346
- If I take one, will you walk away?
- I should change the guacamole.


316
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.857
You know when it goes from green
to brown, like, ugh, that putrid--?


317
00:18:37.993 --> 00:18:40.257
Kind of like your sweater.

318
00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:42.420
- Debbie.
- All right.


319
00:19:07.723 --> 00:19:09.691
Unbelievable.

320
00:19:15.297 --> 00:19:17.128
Come on.

321
00:19:19.368 --> 00:19:22.166
This is a strange one, huh?

322
00:19:22.304 --> 00:19:24.966
- Only Kassie would do it like this.
- Yeah?


323
00:19:25.107 --> 00:19:27.268
- I don't know her that well.
- No?


324
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:30.105
- Can I get you a drink?
- Uh, yes, you sure can.


325
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.471
Thanks, bartender. I'm Wally.

326
00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:36.482
Roland. I'm the, uh, donor.

327
00:19:38.654 --> 00:19:40.451
Yeah.

328
00:19:40.589 --> 00:19:41.920
- Roland, the donor.
- Yeah.


329
00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:46.460
I am-- I am Wally, the best friend.
Kassie's best friend.


330
00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:50.053
Oh. That's okay.

331
00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.193
Great.

332
00:19:52.334 --> 00:19:54.962
- Hi.
- Ahem. Hi.


333
00:19:57.239 --> 00:19:59.264
I feel like the prized hog.

334
00:20:02.444 --> 00:20:06.744
Bet you're used to that, huh?
Hey, let me ask you a question. Um...


335
00:20:06.882 --> 00:20:08.406
Uh, why are you doing this?

336
00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:11.618
We could use the money.

337
00:20:12.054 --> 00:20:14.454
- We?
- Yeah, my wife and I.


338
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.184
Yeah, she's right over there.

339
00:20:18.126 --> 00:20:20.526
- Wow, she's beautiful.
- Yeah, thank you.


340
00:20:20.662 --> 00:20:22.289
Mm-hm, she's the...

341
00:20:22.431 --> 00:20:25.298
She's the light of my life. She is, uh--
She's my soul mate.


342
00:20:25.434 --> 00:20:28.426
Oh, man. Is she--? I'll bet--
Is she the wind under your wings?


343
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.628
- Yeah.
- Right, I get it.


344
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.535
Yeah. Yeah, so it gets a little tough
on a teacher's salary.


345
00:20:32.674 --> 00:20:34.335
I'm an assistant professor at Columbia.

346
00:20:34.476 --> 00:20:36.967
I teach a course
on feminist literary tradition.


347
00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:38.238
- Is that right?
- Yeah.


348
00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.938
Okay.

349
00:20:41.383 --> 00:20:44.216
- It's game time. You ready?
- Uh, okay.


350
00:20:44.353 --> 00:20:48.050
Pick out a nice room,
put everything, well, you know.


351
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.125
Duty calls. Good talking to you, Wally.

352
00:20:53.195 --> 00:20:54.628
Isn't he great?

353
00:20:54.763 --> 00:20:58.358
- Make way. It's happening, people.
- All right, all right. No pressure.


354
00:21:13.582 --> 00:21:14.981
Hi.

355
00:21:15.117 --> 00:21:17.483
I just met your viking.

356
00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:21.384
- Gorgeous, isn't he?
- Yeah, delicious.


357
00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:29.191
What's going on in here?

358
00:21:30.132 --> 00:21:32.191
- Truth?
- Mm-hm.


359
00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.393
I'm freaking out.

360
00:21:34.803 --> 00:21:41.072
I really thought that throwing a party
would, you know, make it fun, but it's...


361
00:21:41.877 --> 00:21:44.641
It's just really depressing.

362
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.280
Come on.

363
00:21:48.116 --> 00:21:50.107
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

364
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.222
I think that you wanna have a child,
and I think that that's natural.


365
00:21:58.827 --> 00:22:00.852
You're not nuts.

366
00:22:02.764 --> 00:22:04.698
You're okay.

367
00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:08.233
Thank you.

368
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.894
- Oh, Wally, thank you.
- All right.


369
00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:11.835
- You get it, don't you?
- I get it.


370
00:22:11.973 --> 00:22:14.237
- You get it.
- Yeah.


371
00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:27.787
Okay, where's my crown? Oh.

372
00:22:30.292 --> 00:22:33.227
Okay. I'm gonna be fine.

373
00:22:33.362 --> 00:22:35.455
I'm just a little emotional.

374
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:38.059
Crown looks fantastic.

375
00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:41.195
Bye.

376
00:22:48.443 --> 00:22:51.207
Let's do a toast. 
Okay, you guys.

377
00:22:52.981 --> 00:22:54.642
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.


378
00:22:54.783 --> 00:23:00.278
Before we get down
to the nitty-gritty and kick you all out,


379
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:03.948
I just wanted to make a toast
to our donor, Roland.


380
00:23:05.293 --> 00:23:06.487
- Yeah!
- Yeah!


381
00:23:06.628 --> 00:23:08.493
Roland, where are you?
The man of our night.


382
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.497
Right there. There he is. Roland.

383
00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:15.862
- How'd it go in there?
- Uh...


384
00:23:16.405 --> 00:23:17.667
Debbie.

385
00:23:17.806 --> 00:23:24.678
I also wanna make a toast to our Kassie,
why we're all here.


386
00:23:24.813 --> 00:23:27.646
You're an inspiration to all of us.

387
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:29.808
You are taking the bull by the horns.

388
00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:34.445
You're venus,
and we're doing it, you know?


389
00:23:34.589 --> 00:23:36.819
So to Kassie.

390
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.825
It's amazing.
We're doing it for ourselves.


391
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:41.223
Yeah, Kassie!

392
00:23:43.432 --> 00:23:46.595
Oh, my God, you-
- You're kidding.

393
00:23:46.735 --> 00:23:50.728
I didn't even plan this. 
This is cosmic.

394
00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:54.433
Hey, Wally.

395
00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.804
Come here, come here.

396
00:24:11.793 --> 00:24:13.988
Yes, I'm in here.

397
00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:18.190
- Maybe use the other bathroom.
- All right.


398
00:24:46.962 --> 00:24:49.328
Pff, Kassie.

399
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:26.189
Oh. Yeah.

400
00:25:36.077 --> 00:25:38.341
- Somebody in there?
- I'm in here.


401
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.311
Okay, sorry.

402
00:27:29.557 --> 00:27:32.424
- Hey.
- Ah. Hey, my head. Please.


403
00:27:32.994 --> 00:27:35.326
You're fired. You're falling apart.

404
00:27:35.463 --> 00:27:38.762
- What the hell was that last night?
- What are you talking about?


405
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.200
Showing up at my place
at 3 in the morning completely drunk?


406
00:27:43.338 --> 00:27:47.331
- Plastered? What is that?
- Whoa, whoa, what?


407
00:27:47.776 --> 00:27:49.368
I was at your place last night?

408
00:27:49.511 --> 00:27:53.242
Yes, and talking some scary
mumbiddy-jumbiddy.


409
00:27:53.381 --> 00:27:55.440
I had nightmares after that, man.

410
00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:57.881
What--? What was I saying?

411
00:27:58.019 --> 00:28:03.651
Oh, I don't know, some wild mutterings
about risky trade,


412
00:28:03.792 --> 00:28:08.923
vikings, and, I don't know,
the music of it was foul and sinister.


413
00:28:09.064 --> 00:28:10.964
Gave me the willies,
gave me the heebie-jeebies.


414
00:28:11.099 --> 00:28:13.158
very dark, really. very disturbing.

415
00:28:13.301 --> 00:28:16.464
I loaded you into a car service pretty quick.
Forty bucks, my treat.


416
00:28:17.372 --> 00:28:19.772
- Leonard, I don't remember any of that.
- What?


417
00:28:21.276 --> 00:28:22.334
How can you not--?

418
00:28:22.477 --> 00:28:25.810
You don't recall at one point, uh,
barking out the name Diane Sawyer?


419
00:28:25.947 --> 00:28:29.610
"Diane Sawyer!"
You don't remember that? At all?


420
00:28:29.751 --> 00:28:31.275
Diane Sawyer
from Good Morning America?


421
00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:34.445
Yeah. By the way, she's always been
quite comely, hasn't she?


422
00:28:34.589 --> 00:28:36.955
Creamy complexion. Mm.

423
00:28:37.092 --> 00:28:39.583
I think she was
a Miss, uh, Something-or-Other.


424
00:28:40.028 --> 00:28:44.522
I went to Kassie's party,
and after that, uh...


425
00:28:45.734 --> 00:28:47.998
I guess I must have blacked out.

426
00:28:48.703 --> 00:28:51.035
- Blacked out?
- Yeah.


427
00:28:51.172 --> 00:28:53.606
Well, you threw up in my hallway
like a college girl.


428
00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:57.940
You seriously don't remember any of it?

429
00:28:58.313 --> 00:29:00.372
No, zero.

430
00:29:00.515 --> 00:29:02.176
Well, I'm telling you, you need help.

431
00:29:05.086 --> 00:29:06.144
So nice, so nice.

432
00:29:10.658 --> 00:29:13.286
Diane Sawyer?

433
00:29:15.163 --> 00:29:15.730
For murder, though it have no tongue,
will speak with most miraculous organ.


434
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:21.464
For murder, though it have no tongue,
will speak with most miraculous organ.


435
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.331
The play's the thing

436
00:29:24.706 --> 00:29:29.234
Wherein I'll catch the conscience
of the King.


437
00:29:36.017 --> 00:29:37.882
Ugh. Do we have
to see the second half?

438
00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:39.987
- Come on, it gets better.
- Do you promise?


439
00:29:41.422 --> 00:29:44.414
I'm not even making a joke.
I mean, it's really unbelievable in there.


440
00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:46.891
I mean, what is this guy
trying to prove, Kassie?


441
00:29:47.028 --> 00:29:49.087
Oh, please.
I thought it was extremely powerful.


442
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.527
- Thank you.
- It's not powerful.


443
00:29:50.665 --> 00:29:52.565
It's like introducing a new character,
you know?


444
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:59.902
A very small, unsettling, uh,
character that, um, you know, frankly--


445
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:01.167
I'm pregnant.

446
00:30:02.777 --> 00:30:05.371
--that is gonna make the king less inclined
to hear this guy out.


447
00:30:05.513 --> 00:30:08.141
I mean, he's not wearing any pants.
It's unnecessary.


448
00:30:08.283 --> 00:30:10.217
Did you hear what I just said?

449
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.044
Yeah.

450
00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:19.185
She went on to tell me

451
00:30:19.327 --> 00:30:21.022
that she was moving back home
to Minnesota.


452
00:30:21.162 --> 00:30:23.687
New York City is no
place to raise a child.

453
00:30:24.265 --> 00:30:28.702
Something about a better place
to raise a kid and loving grandparents.


454
00:30:30.972 --> 00:30:32.997
It ruined the second act for me,
which was a bummer


455
00:30:33.141 --> 00:30:35.871
because the naked guy
ended up killing a bunch of people


456
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.500
and the play got pretty good.

457
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:42.915
Two weeks later, Kassie left.

458
00:30:43.051 --> 00:30:45.781
She got a little choked up
as the moving trucks pulled away,


459
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:49.815
probably sensing what a gigantic mistake
she was making with her life.


460
00:30:51.459 --> 00:30:54.826
She bought me an Airedale terrier,
who I love.


461
00:30:54.963 --> 00:30:58.023
I had to have my floors redone
after one month.


462
00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.596
What do people see in dogs?
They're worse than babies.


463
00:31:04.239 --> 00:31:06.332
We promised to stay in touch,
but who are we kidding?


464
00:31:06.474 --> 00:31:09.966
She was a single mom,
and I lived in New York.


465
00:31:10.678 --> 00:31:15.377
There were Christmas cards and e-mails
but not much else.


466
00:31:48.416 --> 00:31:51.283
And after seven years,

467
00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:53.944
two failed relationships,

468
00:31:54.088 --> 00:31:58.957
one stock-market crash,
and numerous blind dates,


469
00:31:59.093 --> 00:32:00.856
there I was,

470
00:32:00.995 --> 00:32:03.190
right where Kassie left me.

471
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:06.425
You know, when my friend told me
you were still single, I couldn't believe it.


472
00:32:06.567 --> 00:32:07.625
Yep, well...

473
00:32:07.769 --> 00:32:10.738
So you gonna try to take me off the market
on the first date, Pauline?


474
00:32:11.739 --> 00:32:14.674
Yes, I am thinking a June wedding.

475
00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:16.709
And then we'll move out
to the suburbs, huh?


476
00:32:17.345 --> 00:32:21.372
- Okay. Um, New Jersey?
- Great. Easy commute.


477
00:32:21.516 --> 00:32:24.917
Course, I have to work a ton
to afford that second house.


478
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.380
Although that could end up
just being an excuse.


479
00:32:28.523 --> 00:32:30.582
I might just be hiding from, you know,

480
00:32:30.725 --> 00:32:35.924
the ever-growing tedium
of New Jersey drudgery.


481
00:32:37.465 --> 00:32:40.025
Which will then create
some sort of resentment in you.


482
00:32:40.168 --> 00:32:43.001
But you seem like the kind of person
that would internalize that, right?


483
00:32:43.137 --> 00:32:45.105
But, you know, you would act out

484
00:32:45.239 --> 00:32:47.901
in some sort
of self-destructive manner later.


485
00:32:48.042 --> 00:32:49.566
That's me.

486
00:32:49.711 --> 00:32:52.077
And I'm the kind of person
that would blame myself for that


487
00:32:52.213 --> 00:32:54.943
and probably end up
scheduling even more work out of town


488
00:32:55.083 --> 00:32:56.778
to deal with the guilt.

489
00:32:57.485 --> 00:32:59.180
Once I'm out of town,
I'm stuck in a hotel,


490
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.185
I gotta masturbate incessantly
to the Internet,


491
00:33:01.322 --> 00:33:05.884
and you're probably back home
with some afternoon drinking problem.


492
00:33:06.027 --> 00:33:08.655
And I'm gonna end up
a pathetic 50-year-old bachelor


493
00:33:08.796 --> 00:33:12.095
wearing 300-dollar jeans
at a turnpike nightclub,


494
00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:14.793
speaking to women
I should not be speaking to


495
00:33:14.936 --> 00:33:15.994
because they're too young.

496
00:33:20.575 --> 00:33:22.770
Or it could all work out great.

497
00:33:25.913 --> 00:33:30.543
Absolutely unbelievable.
What was I thinking?


498
00:33:30.685 --> 00:33:35.918
Just shut up and smile.
No good ever comes from you talking.


499
00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:38.685
You have one unheard message.

500
00:33:38.826 --> 00:33:40.726
Hey, Wally, it's Kassie.

501
00:33:40.862 --> 00:33:43.524
Guess what.
We are moving back to New York.


502
00:33:43.664 --> 00:33:47.760
I got an amazing offer from ABC,
and I found a great school for Sebastian.


503
00:33:47.902 --> 00:33:49.995
He's already practicing his accent.

504
00:33:50.138 --> 00:33:54.734
Now, call me. This is very exciting.
Okay, bye.


505
00:34:02.617 --> 00:34:05.984
Yeah, well, listen,
I was thinking that, uh, after dinner,


506
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.180
maybe we should go by that, uh, wine bar
that we love to hate.


507
00:34:09.323 --> 00:34:12.019
You know, I think that cheesy old maître d'
that always hit on you,


508
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.958
- I think he's still alive.
- Oh, God, how old is he?


509
00:34:15.096 --> 00:34:16.495
A hundred and fifteen by now.

510
00:34:17.832 --> 00:34:20.528
Actually, Sebastian prefers
only hard alcohol.


511
00:34:21.035 --> 00:34:23.265
Sebastian, huh?

512
00:34:23.404 --> 00:34:26.840
- Not just gonna be you and me?
- What, you don't wanna see him?


513
00:34:26.974 --> 00:34:28.066
Come on. And you know what?

514
00:34:28.209 --> 00:34:30.700
You should actually get him something,
like a little gift.


515
00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:33.673
- Nothing big.
- A small gift, nothing big, huh?


516
00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:37.342
Okay, well, I'll get him, um...

517
00:34:37.485 --> 00:34:39.419
I'll get him...
How about I get him a basketball?


518
00:34:39.554 --> 00:34:41.715
Actually, you know, he's not that athletic.

519
00:34:43.724 --> 00:34:46.716
- Well, then what should I get him?
- He collects picture frames.


520
00:34:46.861 --> 00:34:50.353
- Picture frames?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's weird, I know.


521
00:34:50.498 --> 00:34:54.025
- And he doesn't put pictures in them.
- Uh, wow.


522
00:34:54.168 --> 00:34:55.635
That is very unusual, Kassie.

523
00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.704
- Debbie's here. She says hi.
- Does she?


524
00:34:57.839 --> 00:34:59.431
She's helping me unpack.

525
00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:02.134
Oh, she made a dreamcatcher.

526
00:35:02.276 --> 00:35:04.506
It's just-- I don't know.
We'll see, we'll just...


527
00:35:04.645 --> 00:35:09.048
So listen, um,
I will see you tonight, okay?


528
00:35:09.183 --> 00:35:13.449
Oh, yeah, Wally,
thank you for rejecting my friend request.


529
00:35:13.588 --> 00:35:14.646
Did you get that?

530
00:35:14.789 --> 00:35:17.451
You can tell Debbie
that it was all part of my master plan


531
00:35:17.592 --> 00:35:19.253
to get her completely out of my life.

532
00:35:19.727 --> 00:35:21.854
Right. I cannot tell her that.

533
00:35:21.996 --> 00:35:23.793
- Yeah, all right.
- Okay, see you later.


534
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:25.023
Okay.

535
00:35:50.391 --> 00:35:52.825
Hi, I'm looking for
a young lady that, uh--

536
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.394
Oh, got it, right there.

537
00:36:03.804 --> 00:36:05.897
Pardon me, miss?

538
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:07.940
Wow.

539
00:36:08.075 --> 00:36:09.838
Hi.

540
00:36:11.612 --> 00:36:13.443
- You look great.
- Look at you.


541
00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:17.377
Who took over dressing you?

542
00:36:17.518 --> 00:36:21.648
- Nobody. What are you talking about?
- Come on. I like it.


543
00:36:21.789 --> 00:36:23.950
- How's Sebastian? Where is he?
- Oh, he's over there.


544
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:25.581
But listen, if he's a little strange,

545
00:36:25.726 --> 00:36:28.923
it's just he's having some
adjustment issues to the move, so...


546
00:36:29.063 --> 00:36:30.758
But he's watching the fish.

547
00:36:33.968 --> 00:36:38.268
- I think he's gonna be just fine.
- Matthew, come on, it's time to go.


548
00:36:54.689 --> 00:36:56.919
I think I have cyclothymic disorder.

549
00:36:57.391 --> 00:36:59.859
I looked right at the shark
and felt nothing.


550
00:36:59.994 --> 00:37:03.430
Honey, I don't know what that is,
but I'm sure you don't have it.


551
00:37:03.564 --> 00:37:06.624
Sweetie, this is Uncle Wally. Say hi.

552
00:37:06.767 --> 00:37:09.497
- Hi.
- Hi, Sebastian.


553
00:37:09.637 --> 00:37:13.129
emotional ups and downs,

554
00:37:13.274 --> 00:37:18.371
hyperactivity, loss of interest
and/or pleasure, lack of sexual drive.


555
00:37:18.512 --> 00:37:21.379
Okay, was I not clear about WebMD?

556
00:37:21.515 --> 00:37:24.211
Sebastian, now, look,
Wally has a gift for you.


557
00:37:24.352 --> 00:37:28.049
- Let's see what he got you.
- Yes, I do. Take a look at this.


558
00:37:29.323 --> 00:37:34.283
That's so sweet, 
Wally, very sweet.

559
00:37:34.428 --> 00:37:36.157
Oh, wow.

560
00:37:41.135 --> 00:37:43.160
It's a Lunt Silver Edition.

561
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:49.935
- Where's the picture?
- What picture?


562
00:37:50.077 --> 00:37:54.138
The one that comes with the frame.
It's the most important part.


563
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.015
- What?
- This frame's used.


564
00:38:01.455 --> 00:38:02.513
Say thank you.

565
00:38:03.324 --> 00:38:04.985
- Thanks.
- You got it.


566
00:38:05.126 --> 00:38:08.493
Look at this. Okay, guys.
Here's a big surprise.


567
00:38:08.629 --> 00:38:10.893
I called ahead on the phone,
I pre-ordered this.


568
00:38:11.032 --> 00:38:14.798
Are you ready for the best duck
in the whole wide world? Huh?


569
00:38:14.935 --> 00:38:18.268
- I can't eat duck.
- What do you mean, you can't eat duck?


570
00:38:18.406 --> 00:38:21.842
Wally, do you know what they do to ducks
at the waterfowl farms?


571
00:38:21.976 --> 00:38:25.537
No, no, sweetie, I think that's veal.
You're thinking of veal.


572
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.877
No, I read about the ducks too.

573
00:38:29.016 --> 00:38:31.883
They force-feed the ducks

574
00:38:32.019 --> 00:38:34.317
through a plastic tube
they drill into their throats.


575
00:38:34.455 --> 00:38:37.253
I called on the phone, 
I pre-ordered this.

576
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:39.655
The ducks get this liver disease
called hepatic lipidosis


577
00:38:39.794 --> 00:38:40.920
and they can't walk.

578
00:38:41.362 --> 00:38:45.856
Nature's in crisis,
and there's only one mammal to blame.


579
00:38:48.135 --> 00:38:49.625
What's going on here?
What do you got?


580
00:38:50.604 --> 00:38:51.935
He's stubborn.

581
00:38:53.007 --> 00:38:54.133
Hey, guess what.

582
00:38:54.275 --> 00:38:55.765
This cost me $84,

583
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.435
and it's gonna be about
the best culinary treat you've ever had.


584
00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:00.103
I won't do it, Uncle Wally.

585
00:39:00.247 --> 00:39:02.943
- And I'll hate you if you do.
- Okay, let's not--


586
00:39:03.084 --> 00:39:06.485
We don't say "hate," sweetie.
We don't say "hate."


587
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:08.782
Okay?

588
00:39:09.557 --> 00:39:13.323
- We can have rice with soy sauce.
- Great, rice with soy sauce.


589
00:39:13.761 --> 00:39:17.891
That's a great compromise.
Uncle Wally loves rice.


590
00:39:18.466 --> 00:39:19.728
He likes you.

591
00:39:20.134 --> 00:39:23.433
- You're kidding, right?
- No, that's like for him, it is.


592
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:25.095
Hey, listen, will you do me a favor?

593
00:39:25.239 --> 00:39:27.434
Would you watch him
for a couple hours this weekend?


594
00:39:27.575 --> 00:39:29.236
- I don't think--
- No, it is, here.


595
00:39:29.377 --> 00:39:32.676
See, I have to go to a parent, um,
orientation thing at his school.


596
00:39:32.813 --> 00:39:34.804
It would really help me out.

597
00:39:34.949 --> 00:39:37.782
I also think it would be good for you guys
to spend some time together,


598
00:39:37.918 --> 00:39:39.943
you know, a little get-to-know-me time.

599
00:39:41.088 --> 00:39:42.521
Hi, excuse me.

600
00:39:42.656 --> 00:39:46.854
Hi, could I get a soda
on the rocks, uh, for myself


601
00:39:46.994 --> 00:39:48.962
and, uh, some steamed vegetables?

602
00:39:58.606 --> 00:40:00.801
- Sorry about that, Wally.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.


603
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:02.431
I'll expense it, okay?

604
00:40:02.576 --> 00:40:05.841
And I'll, uh, just cut it up
and put it in my cereal.


605
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.006
- It's better than bananas.
- Ooh, that sounds delicious.


606
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.118
The neck is sort of, you know,
shaped like banana,


607
00:40:11.252 --> 00:40:12.776
so it'll slice up nice.

608
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.015
Honey, stay close.

609
00:40:15.156 --> 00:40:17.784
- Isn't he great?
- Oh, my gosh.


610
00:40:17.925 --> 00:40:20.689
- He thinks I'm a lesbian.
- What?


611
00:40:20.828 --> 00:40:25.822
I guess the only mothers he knows
with seed guys for fathers are lesbians.


612
00:40:25.966 --> 00:40:27.456
Mom.

613
00:40:27.935 --> 00:40:30.403
- Can I go in?
- No, sweetie, we've gotta get home.


614
00:40:31.038 --> 00:40:32.596
He's so smart and willful,

615
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:36.301
and he considers everything,
and it's just never boring.


616
00:40:36.444 --> 00:40:40.244
- He went in.
- I know, he does that.


617
00:40:45.052 --> 00:40:46.986
What's a-
- What's a seed guy?

618
00:40:47.121 --> 00:40:50.750
Uh, that's his-
- Part of his birth story.

619
00:40:51.358 --> 00:40:52.689
This should be good.

620
00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:56.422
It's the story I've been telling him
about how he got here.


621
00:40:57.031 --> 00:41:00.125
I told him that Mommy
didn't have a husband


622
00:41:00.267 --> 00:41:05.034
but wanted you so very, very much
that she couldn't wait another day.


623
00:41:05.539 --> 00:41:09.498
And so she went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,


624
00:41:09.643 --> 00:41:13.101
"If you go out into the world
and you look very, very hard,


625
00:41:13.547 --> 00:41:18.575
you'll find a very special person who,
if you ask very nicely,


626
00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:20.084
will give you seeds,"

627
00:41:20.855 --> 00:41:23.119
so that I can
plant you in my tummy.

628
00:41:23.257 --> 00:41:24.884
Got it.

629
00:41:25.426 --> 00:41:27.724
But I-
- You know, I've read all the books

630
00:41:27.862 --> 00:41:30.353
about how you're supposed to talk
about this stuff,


631
00:41:30.498 --> 00:41:34.559
and until it happens,
nothing can prepare you for the day


632
00:41:34.702 --> 00:41:36.431
when your kid comes home crying
after school


633
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.869
because some lard-ass
called him a science experiment.


634
00:41:47.214 --> 00:41:49.375
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

635
00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.118
Thank you.

636
00:42:02.363 --> 00:42:05.992
- Who was that?
- A text. Text from Roland.


637
00:42:07.468 --> 00:42:11.734
- Who's Roland?
- The seed guy. The donor.


638
00:42:13.607 --> 00:42:17.566
- You still talk to him?
- Yeah. Well, I called him when I got back.


639
00:42:17.711 --> 00:42:18.769
Why? What for?

640
00:42:18.913 --> 00:42:21.814
Well, there's a reason I didn't want
the donor to be anonymous.


641
00:42:21.949 --> 00:42:24.349
You know, so that when Sebastian
started asking questions,


642
00:42:24.485 --> 00:42:26.214
I would have answers.

643
00:42:26.353 --> 00:42:28.753
And I'd like to
get to know this guy.

644
00:42:28.889 --> 00:42:31.084
You know,
someday I think I'd like them to meet.


645
00:42:31.225 --> 00:42:33.455
Okay, what's Mrs. Roland gonna think
about all of this?


646
00:42:33.594 --> 00:42:37.189
There isn't a Mrs. Roland.
They got a divorce.


647
00:42:41.502 --> 00:42:45.939
So I'm very sorry
to hear about your divorce, by the way.


648
00:42:46.073 --> 00:42:48.541
Oh. Thank you.

649
00:42:48.676 --> 00:42:50.473
Don't worry, it's, uh...

650
00:42:50.611 --> 00:42:52.977
I won't get into how the marriage ended.

651
00:42:53.113 --> 00:42:56.879
I don't wanna bore you with the details
of how she cheated on me.


652
00:42:57.017 --> 00:42:59.383
- Oh.
- Let's just say it's gonna be a long time


653
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.388
before I can trust anyone
involved in the instruction of Pilates.


654
00:43:03.524 --> 00:43:06.152
We'll just leave it at that.

655
00:43:06.794 --> 00:43:09.024
Yeah, okay, fair enough.

656
00:43:11.699 --> 00:43:16.966
So listen, you're under no obligation
to do anything.


657
00:43:17.104 --> 00:43:19.538
And I know that you didn't expect
to do anything


658
00:43:19.673 --> 00:43:22.335
other than, um, you know, donating.

659
00:43:22.476 --> 00:43:26.276
Uh, which you did so wonderfully,
by the way.


660
00:43:26.413 --> 00:43:28.108
- I don't mean that to sound like--
- Kass.


661
00:43:28.248 --> 00:43:30.682
You know what I meant.
I just meant for future, down the road,


662
00:43:30.818 --> 00:43:32.445
- if he starts to ask questions--
- Kass.


663
00:43:32.586 --> 00:43:33.985
Mm-hm?

664
00:43:34.588 --> 00:43:36.579
I was honored to receive your call.

665
00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:38.516
Really?

666
00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:44.029
I always wondered about this, you know,
him and you and how it turned out.


667
00:43:44.164 --> 00:43:45.256
I mean, you know--

668
00:43:45.399 --> 00:43:48.232
Roland, would you like to see
a picture of him?


669
00:43:49.236 --> 00:43:51.898
- I would love that.
- Would you?


670
00:43:53.173 --> 00:43:55.937
- Ready?
- Let me see.


671
00:43:56.076 --> 00:43:57.441
Oh.

672
00:43:58.545 --> 00:43:59.603
He's beautiful.

673
00:44:00.781 --> 00:44:01.839
Isn't he?

674
00:44:02.249 --> 00:44:05.548
I gotta say, Kass,

675
00:44:05.686 --> 00:44:09.782
I see a lot more
of me in him than you.

676
00:44:11.525 --> 00:44:12.583
Wow.

677
00:44:12.726 --> 00:44:16.355
Hey, I didn't get to say this
to you back then, but I really respect you.


678
00:44:17.064 --> 00:44:20.261
Your choice,
in doing this the way that you did.


679
00:44:20.934 --> 00:44:22.834
It took a lot of guts.

680
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:27.703
It was courageous,
and I simply don't see that out there.


681
00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:33.307
- What?
- No, nothing. It's just...


682
00:44:35.015 --> 00:44:38.041
That's a really kind thing to say.

683
00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:40.609
Well, it's true.

684
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:47.458
Well, this went...
This went a lot better than I expected.


685
00:44:47.594 --> 00:44:48.788
Yeah, for me too.

686
00:44:49.563 --> 00:44:51.121
Yeah.

687
00:44:54.668 --> 00:44:56.295
- Coffee hot?
- Yes.


688
00:45:05.279 --> 00:45:08.646
I've always found penguins
a bit of a mystery.


689
00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:11.818
I think puppets are a mystery.

690
00:45:17.825 --> 00:45:21.192
- I'm having a birthday party.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you enjoy that.


691
00:45:21.328 --> 00:45:22.386
There's gonna come a time

692
00:45:22.529 --> 00:45:25.054
when you're not gonna want people
to know it's your birthday.


693
00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:28.600
Why wouldn't anyone want people to know
about their birthday?


694
00:45:29.369 --> 00:45:31.735
Because getting old sucks.

695
00:45:31.872 --> 00:45:33.840
Most people don't accomplish
what they'd hoped to,


696
00:45:33.974 --> 00:45:37.000
and they realize
that they're most likely not going to.


697
00:45:37.144 --> 00:45:39.135
They end up living these quiet lives
of denial,


698
00:45:39.279 --> 00:45:41.440
and, you know,
brushing birthdays under the rug


699
00:45:41.582 --> 00:45:44.142
just becomes a big part of that.

700
00:45:47.121 --> 00:45:51.285
Do you ever get scared
that you could have Parkinson's disease?


701
00:45:52.526 --> 00:45:55.461
Not specifically Parkinson's,
but I'm not gonna lie,


702
00:45:55.596 --> 00:45:57.564
I've had my bouts with hypochondria.

703
00:45:58.632 --> 00:45:59.690
What's that?

704
00:45:59.833 --> 00:46:03.234
That's thinking that you have diseases
that you don't really have.


705
00:46:04.538 --> 00:46:07.473
Oh, my God, I have that.

706
00:46:10.577 --> 00:46:12.545
Do you wanna tell me
about your new school?


707
00:46:12.946 --> 00:46:14.573
Why?

708
00:46:15.616 --> 00:46:18.483
Because you're a kid,
there's nothing else to talk about.


709
00:46:18.619 --> 00:46:20.712
Well...

710
00:46:21.255 --> 00:46:24.053
I don't wanna talk about it.

711
00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.657
What's his name?

712
00:46:30.697 --> 00:46:32.187
Aaron O'Connor.

713
00:46:33.967 --> 00:46:35.264
Aaron O'Connor.

714
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:40.506
- How'd you know?
- Because I've been there.


715
00:46:40.874 --> 00:46:44.605
- You went to P.S. 66?
- No, the proverbial there.


716
00:46:44.745 --> 00:46:47.839
You know you're gonna have to stand up
to him sooner or later, right?


717
00:46:48.282 --> 00:46:50.113
I don't want to.

718
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.013
Well, then he's probably
gonna kick your ass.


719
00:46:52.152 --> 00:46:54.143
You all right with that?

720
00:46:54.288 --> 00:46:58.349
But he's bigger than me
and he knows karate.


721
00:46:58.492 --> 00:47:02.087
Oh, he's a karate guy.
Well, then just, uh...


722
00:47:02.229 --> 00:47:06.222
Tell you what.
What you do is you act crazy.


723
00:47:06.366 --> 00:47:09.028
- What?
- Yeah, you act crazy, all right?


724
00:47:09.169 --> 00:47:10.500
No one messes with the crazy guy.

725
00:47:10.637 --> 00:47:13.367
You just look at him
like you just don't give a fu--


726
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:15.668
Funyun.

727
00:47:15.809 --> 00:47:19.677
- Like a don't give a Funyun?
- That's right, like you don't give a Funyun.


728
00:47:19.813 --> 00:47:21.804
Like you don't care
what happens to you, okay?


729
00:47:21.949 --> 00:47:23.541
Just like you're insane.

730
00:47:23.951 --> 00:47:26.579
Crazy people are wild cards,
they're very unpredictable.


731
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.553
You never know what they're gonna do.
It makes people very scared.


732
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:32.181
It scares even Aaron O' Connor.

733
00:47:32.793 --> 00:47:35.353
- Okay?
- Okay.


734
00:47:45.706 --> 00:47:46.832
He looks just like you.

735
00:47:48.175 --> 00:47:50.006
He's not my son.

736
00:47:52.646 --> 00:47:57.583
- How old is he?
- Uh, I think he's 5. Five, I think.


737
00:47:58.785 --> 00:48:00.343
Well...

738
00:48:00.854 --> 00:48:02.754
He's a little you.

739
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:18.961
It's really cool.

740
00:48:20.507 --> 00:48:23.374
Hi. Come here.

741
00:48:24.344 --> 00:48:27.939
Hey. Hi.

742
00:48:28.081 --> 00:48:30.481
- We went to the zoo, and it was really fun.
- Really?


743
00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:34.018
Oh, my gosh,
that sounds like so much fun.


744
00:48:34.154 --> 00:48:35.712
Wally showed me the whole park.

745
00:48:36.423 --> 00:48:38.220
Mm.

746
00:48:39.026 --> 00:48:40.687
- Would you grab my bag?
- Yeah.


747
00:48:40.827 --> 00:48:43.853
Okay, tell me more about it.
What else did you see?


748
00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:49.961
So here's what we got.

749
00:48:50.103 --> 00:48:55.837
If you go with the cowboys again,
that means that in your dreams,


750
00:48:55.976 --> 00:48:58.410
you're gonna travel
to the plains of Colorado


751
00:48:58.545 --> 00:49:01.412
and you're gonna herd cattle.

752
00:49:01.548 --> 00:49:03.243
But I don't wanna kill any Indians.

753
00:49:03.583 --> 00:49:06.313
Well, you don't have to kill
any Indians, honey.


754
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.756
- What about if I go with the astronauts?
- Okay.


755
00:49:10.891 --> 00:49:13.553
If you go with the astronauts,

756
00:49:13.694 --> 00:49:16.094
that means you're gonna travel
to the moon,


757
00:49:16.229 --> 00:49:20.427
and you'll be driving on the moon
in one of those really cool buggies


758
00:49:20.567 --> 00:49:22.660
that has a flag
coming out of the back.

759
00:49:22.803 --> 00:49:24.930
I think I'll go with the astronauts.

760
00:49:25.072 --> 00:49:28.235
Good choice. Let's get you in bed.

761
00:49:28.375 --> 00:49:30.605
Oh, my Lord, to the moon we go.

762
00:49:30.744 --> 00:49:34.942
We're gonna have to decide who's gonna
be sleeping with Sebastian tonight.


763
00:49:35.082 --> 00:49:38.017
- Hmm.
- Duck or unfortunate chicken?


764
00:49:38.852 --> 00:49:40.752
- Dead chicken.
- Dead chicken?


765
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.353
Oh, poor dead chicken.

766
00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.855
God, he's exhausted.

767
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.490
What did you do to him?

768
00:49:54.634 --> 00:49:56.727
Did you finally get him to pass out?

769
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:59.964
Yup, I did. What are you looking at?

770
00:50:00.374 --> 00:50:04.777
Looking at some really weird pictures
for some reason you keep.


771
00:50:04.911 --> 00:50:07.311
Like this one.
That was not a great choice.


772
00:50:07.447 --> 00:50:08.641
Are you kid--?

773
00:50:08.782 --> 00:50:11.649
- Fabulous choice. What do you mean?
- Not really.


774
00:50:11.785 --> 00:50:15.778
And how odd
that you were the only one not in costume.


775
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:17.548
So not like you.

776
00:50:17.691 --> 00:50:20.125
If I had bunny ears like that,
I would've worn them.


777
00:50:21.094 --> 00:50:24.325
- That was our second date, right?
- Yes, I think you're right.


778
00:50:24.464 --> 00:50:29.094
And didn't you make us dance
to C+C Music Factory this whole party?


779
00:50:29.236 --> 00:50:31.796
- I think you did.
- I do believe I did make us do that.


780
00:50:31.938 --> 00:50:33.906
Yeah. They were like your favorite band
back then.


781
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:37.340
- You were, like, a C+C super fan.
- That's right, I was.


782
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.644
And you kissed me
at this party, I think.

783
00:50:43.283 --> 00:50:47.947
I didn't kiss-- I was in character.
I was a Playboy Bunny.


784
00:50:48.088 --> 00:50:49.646
- Please.
- Big kiss.


785
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:53.521
Do you remember
that you disappeared on me that night?


786
00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.294
You were supposed to take me home.

787
00:50:58.265 --> 00:51:00.233
Heading for the hills
when things get too intense?


788
00:51:00.367 --> 00:51:01.834
That doesn't sound like me.

789
00:51:08.708 --> 00:51:12.075
Wasn't this the trip that I was supposed
to go on that I didn't go on?


790
00:51:12.212 --> 00:51:14.578
Wasn't it your third, um...?

791
00:51:20.754 --> 00:51:24.656
Mom, I think I wanna herd cattle.

792
00:51:25.759 --> 00:51:26.885
Okay.

793
00:51:27.427 --> 00:51:29.054
I'm gonna...

794
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.388
I'm going to--

795
00:51:31.531 --> 00:51:33.260
- I gotta go get into my p.j.'s too.
- Okay.


796
00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.924
I'll call you in the morning.

797
00:51:48.181 --> 00:51:52.049
And the most inventive
are video open houses right now.


798
00:52:07.467 --> 00:52:09.799
- Hello?
- Hey, Leonard, Wally here.


799
00:52:09.936 --> 00:52:12.063
Listen, I'm freaking out a little bit.

800
00:52:12.205 --> 00:52:14.765
Yeah. Yeah, no. 
Put it in my mouth.

801
00:52:14.908 --> 00:52:17.103
- Hello?
- Hello? Yes? Wait a second.


802
00:52:17.244 --> 00:52:18.871
Are you eating?
Want me to call you back?


803
00:52:19.012 --> 00:52:21.810
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Tell me what you're freaking out about.


804
00:52:21.948 --> 00:52:26.385
Well, you know, I just--
I think that, um, I--


805
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.115
That somehow-- Hey.
Okay, stay with me here.


806
00:52:30.257 --> 00:52:33.158
I've been hanging out with Sebastian a lot
over the last couple of weeks,


807
00:52:33.293 --> 00:52:37.787
and there's these similarities
and coincidences that--


808
00:52:37.931 --> 00:52:40.923
I mean, I gotta run this stuff by Kassie.
She's, uh--


809
00:52:41.067 --> 00:52:43.934
- What's the matter?
- Here comes the crazy. Somehow...


810
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:47.403
- Yes?
- It's like this kid is mine.


811
00:52:47.541 --> 00:52:51.705
- Like he's more me than the Viking.
- The kid might be yours?


812
00:52:51.845 --> 00:52:53.836
Viking?

813
00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.177
I don't know why, vaguely,
what you're saying...


814
00:52:57.317 --> 00:53:00.377
Hmm. Hmm.

815
00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:03.011
Where are you now?
Come over here, why don't you?


816
00:53:03.156 --> 00:53:04.316
- Hang on.
- What?


817
00:53:04.457 --> 00:53:07.290
- Why wouldn't you tell me that before?
- Because-- Don't get mad at me.


818
00:53:07.427 --> 00:53:09.657
Because you never needed my help
before this.


819
00:53:09.796 --> 00:53:12.731
I'm giving you everything I have.
You know, this was seven years ago.


820
00:53:12.866 --> 00:53:15.027
You were so drunk
and you were talking gibberish,


821
00:53:15.168 --> 00:53:18.763
and I didn't know that, uh,
"trading Diane Sawyer to the vikings"


822
00:53:18.905 --> 00:53:20.463
meant anything to anybody.

823
00:53:20.607 --> 00:53:25.044
- How--? What does that mean?
- What does it mean? What--?


824
00:53:25.178 --> 00:53:28.614
Roland is the viking, the viking is Roland.
Don't you see what that means?


825
00:53:28.748 --> 00:53:29.806
Who is Roland?

826
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:31.975
Kassie's donor is Roland.
Roland's the viking.


827
00:53:32.118 --> 00:53:34.143
He's the donor.
I'm sorry if I didn't tell you that.


828
00:53:34.287 --> 00:53:35.413
Okay, well, okay.

829
00:53:35.555 --> 00:53:39.457
So, what you're saying
is that, um, he is the donor,


830
00:53:39.593 --> 00:53:41.356
and there was a trade made.

831
00:53:41.494 --> 00:53:43.860
- Yup.
- Okay, uh, what kind of trade?


832
00:53:43.997 --> 00:53:46.329
- Who--? For who? Who?
- Oh, my God, holy shit.


833
00:53:46.466 --> 00:53:50.766
I mean, you don't think that I could have--?
That I...?


834
00:53:50.904 --> 00:53:52.997
You're what? You're what?
Help me out here.


835
00:53:53.139 --> 00:54:00.011
That I could have traded
the viking's ingredient for my...


836
00:54:02.616 --> 00:54:04.880
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

837
00:54:05.018 --> 00:54:08.749
Wow. How would that have even
occurred? Was there...?


838
00:54:08.888 --> 00:54:12.187
I'm trying to picture it.
Was there access to, uh, his ingredients?


839
00:54:12.325 --> 00:54:13.952
- I don't even know...
- Was there access?


840
00:54:14.094 --> 00:54:15.959
I mean, I don't know, I...

841
00:54:18.765 --> 00:54:20.426
Uh-oh.

842
00:54:21.668 --> 00:54:24.569
Oh, jeez.
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.


843
00:54:28.808 --> 00:54:32.642
- Yeah, I think that there was access.
- Really?


844
00:54:33.013 --> 00:54:36.380
- Is it starting to come back?
- Yeah, there was access. Oh, my God.


845
00:54:36.516 --> 00:54:40.282
- I don't like the way this is going.
- Oh, my God, I got...


846
00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.651
I think I got Sawyer in the bathroom,
I think.


847
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:46.816
Because Kassie knows Diane Sawyer
and invited her somehow?


848
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.326
Oh, my God.

849
00:54:51.564 --> 00:54:53.361
I switched it.

850
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.994
I-- Oh, that's-- My God.
You switched? Really?


851
00:54:58.138 --> 00:55:00.868
I hijacked Kassie's pregnancy?

852
00:55:01.708 --> 00:55:05.200
Oh, that's ill-advised.

853
00:55:05.378 --> 00:55:08.370
How do I not remember that?

854
00:55:08.515 --> 00:55:12.246
Well, because you were horribly drunk,
you're a--


855
00:55:12.385 --> 00:55:14.012
You repress everything.

856
00:55:14.154 --> 00:55:16.714
You know, I've told you
about hungry dogs in the cellar.


857
00:55:16.856 --> 00:55:18.881
If you don't feed them,
you don't acknowledge them,


858
00:55:19.025 --> 00:55:22.085
at some point they're gonna get out
somehow and do something unsavory.


859
00:55:22.228 --> 00:55:25.493
- Exhibit A.
- My God, am I a horrible person?


860
00:55:25.632 --> 00:55:28.260
- No, no, no.
- Oh, Leonard, I gotta go tell her.


861
00:55:28.401 --> 00:55:32.235
Oh, no, no, no.
Telling Kassie? Oh, that's-- Ay.


862
00:55:32.372 --> 00:55:34.863
Well, yes, but that's so challenging,
so delicate.


863
00:55:35.008 --> 00:55:36.475
It's the right thing to do, Leonard.

864
00:55:36.609 --> 00:55:39.009
Yeah, maybe,
but don't you wanna talk to a lawyer first?


865
00:55:39.145 --> 00:55:41.045
- There are--
- Huh? No, no. No lawyer.


866
00:55:41.181 --> 00:55:44.309
- I gotta go tell her.
- Yeah, okay, but before you go, though...


867
00:55:44.684 --> 00:55:48.950
- Okay.
- Um, if this is true, gee, what great news.


868
00:55:49.089 --> 00:55:53.287
- Congratulations, you're a father.
- That's not helpful.


869
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.394
Hi, Wally.

870
00:56:04.938 --> 00:56:07.805
Hey, buddy. What are you doing awake?

871
00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:09.431
Insomnia.

872
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:12.774
- Where's your mom?
- In her bath.


873
00:56:12.912 --> 00:56:15.244
Mom, Wally's here!

874
00:56:15.382 --> 00:56:17.077
Uh, okay.

875
00:56:18.418 --> 00:56:19.749
You can use them any--

876
00:56:19.886 --> 00:56:21.979
- McKay--
- ...money back--


877
00:56:22.455 --> 00:56:24.753
- ...maxed out--
- ...or fun.


878
00:56:24.891 --> 00:56:26.119
- ...until we--
- ...brand-new--


879
00:56:26.259 --> 00:56:27.590
- Visit your loc--
- ...cheetahs--


880
00:56:27.727 --> 00:56:29.422
- Fight for--
- The cent--


881
00:56:29.562 --> 00:56:32.030
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Watching Tv.


882
00:56:32.165 --> 00:56:33.496
No, you're not, actually,

883
00:56:33.633 --> 00:56:36.033
you're just incessantly switching
those channels.


884
00:56:36.169 --> 00:56:37.932
No, I'm watching all the shows at once.

885
00:56:38.071 --> 00:56:39.470
- Guess what.
- Three big cats.


886
00:56:39.606 --> 00:56:40.800
- Hey, listen.
- Hey.


887
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.567
We're gonna have to
do this better, okay?


888
00:56:42.709 --> 00:56:45.610
Because we're gonna be
in each other's lives for a very long time.


889
00:56:45.745 --> 00:56:48.771
Why are we gonna be in each other's lives
for a long time?


890
00:56:49.649 --> 00:56:52.641
Because, um, you know, I'm, uh...

891
00:56:52.786 --> 00:56:54.811
I'm your-
- I'm friends with your mother.

892
00:56:55.388 --> 00:56:58.221
Well, that doesn't mean
you're friends with me.


893
00:56:58.358 --> 00:56:59.586
- So give me the clicker.
- No.


894
00:56:59.726 --> 00:57:00.784
- No.
- Yes.


895
00:57:00.927 --> 00:57:01.985
- No.
- Yes.


896
00:57:02.128 --> 00:57:03.186
- No.
- Yes.


897
00:57:03.329 --> 00:57:05.160
- No, Sebastian. No.
- Yes. Yes.


898
00:57:05.298 --> 00:57:06.697
- Wally.
- Yes?


899
00:57:07.901 --> 00:57:11.132
- What are you doing?
- I need to talk to you.


900
00:57:11.738 --> 00:57:13.296
Okay.

901
00:57:15.208 --> 00:57:16.869
Outside.

902
00:57:17.677 --> 00:57:19.269
Outs...?

903
00:57:19.946 --> 00:57:21.538
I'll be right outside.

904
00:57:22.482 --> 00:57:23.915
- That is quite--
- It's that easy.


905
00:57:25.552 --> 00:57:29.488
- All the way outside?
- I think it's better. Just-- Almost there.


906
00:57:29.923 --> 00:57:31.413
Um...

907
00:57:31.858 --> 00:57:34.918
So, uh, listen, I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just--


908
00:57:35.061 --> 00:57:36.961
I'm gonna start, um...

909
00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:39.828
You're the most important person
in my life.


910
00:57:39.966 --> 00:57:41.490
- Yeah.
- Um...


911
00:57:42.836 --> 00:57:44.667
It's difficult.

912
00:57:45.605 --> 00:57:47.937
It's like the hardest thing
I've ever had to say to anyone,


913
00:57:48.074 --> 00:57:51.703
okay, because you know
that I would do anything for you, Kassie.


914
00:57:52.812 --> 00:57:55.940
We've known each other
for such a long time,


915
00:57:56.082 --> 00:57:58.209
so the last thing I wanna do
is lose you, okay,


916
00:57:58.351 --> 00:58:01.616
but just, some things have to be said,
you know,


917
00:58:01.754 --> 00:58:04.882
even if they're uncomfortable--

918
00:58:05.024 --> 00:58:07.515
Stop, Wally.

919
00:58:08.461 --> 00:58:10.019
I think I know what you're gonna say.

920
00:58:10.163 --> 00:58:12.961
- I don't think you know.
- Wally.


921
00:58:13.433 --> 00:58:15.560
Since I've been back...

922
00:58:15.702 --> 00:58:20.469
And we have known each other
for such a long time.


923
00:58:20.874 --> 00:58:23.240
Clearly, we missed each other.

924
00:58:23.376 --> 00:58:26.106
I would be lying if
I said I didn't realize

925
00:58:26.246 --> 00:58:31.445
that there was a definite, you know,
energy between us.


926
00:58:32.018 --> 00:58:35.954
I mean, sometimes--
You know, sometimes I feel it too.


927
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:38.782
- Energy?
- Yeah.


928
00:58:38.925 --> 00:58:42.520
I mean,
that's what you're trying to tell me.


929
00:58:43.129 --> 00:58:48.396
That you have feelings for me.

930
00:58:50.303 --> 00:58:51.861
Right?

931
00:58:52.272 --> 00:58:54.763
Not exactly, but...

932
00:59:00.046 --> 00:59:03.209
Oh, my-
- Oh, my God.

933
00:59:04.384 --> 00:59:05.908
What?

934
00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:08.583
I'm-
- You know what?

935
00:59:09.622 --> 00:59:14.855
I-- No, no. I'm just really--
It's complicated, Wally. I'm like:


936
00:59:15.628 --> 00:59:18.188
Just work,
and I'm sort of in this Roland thing,


937
00:59:18.331 --> 00:59:19.423
so I'm not, you know...

938
00:59:19.566 --> 00:59:21.932
- Huh?
- I-- I'm sorry. Ha, ha.


939
00:59:22.068 --> 00:59:23.399
- What?
- I don't-- You know what?


940
00:59:23.536 --> 00:59:26.699
Let's just say good night.
Let's "good night" it.


941
00:59:26.839 --> 00:59:31.173
And, um, again, I'm sorry, and I just--
You get it.


942
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:32.938
You get it.

943
00:59:33.079 --> 00:59:34.603
Ouch.

944
00:59:38.284 --> 00:59:39.842
Great.

945
00:59:42.121 --> 00:59:45.750
- Sebastian, please open the door.
- No.


946
00:59:45.892 --> 00:59:48.190
- Roland thing?
- Oh, such a-- Not a good time.


947
00:59:48.328 --> 00:59:49.522
Not a good time.

948
00:59:49.963 --> 00:59:51.954
- Sebastian.
- What Roland thing?


949
00:59:53.833 --> 00:59:56.131
We've just been spending
some time together.


950
00:59:57.337 --> 00:59:59.897
Is it like dating?

951
01:00:00.406 --> 01:00:03.307
- I-- Yeah, I guess. I...
- Has he met Sebastian?


952
01:00:03.443 --> 01:00:04.569
Shh.

953
01:00:04.711 --> 01:00:06.474
- Does Sebastian know--?
- No.


954
01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.413
I've set specific rules.

955
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:12.518
Sebastian just doesn't like
when I'm with anybody.


956
01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.176
That's why he's doing this. Sebastian.

957
01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.452
- Where did Roland take you?
- A reading.


958
01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:19.490
- Like a book reading?
- Would you please?


959
01:00:19.626 --> 01:00:21.753
- What was the reading about?
- It was about a kayak.


960
01:00:21.894 --> 01:00:23.088
- A kayak?
- Sebastian!


961
01:00:23.229 --> 01:00:25.390
- Sounds like a great date.
- Open this door right now.


962
01:00:25.531 --> 01:00:27.522
Open it yourself.

963
01:00:28.201 --> 01:00:31.932
- What?
- You both are driving me crazy.


964
01:00:37.243 --> 01:00:38.938
She's mad.

965
01:00:45.385 --> 01:00:47.876
She's got a boyfriend.

966
01:00:48.988 --> 01:00:51.081
A few dates don't make a boyfriend.

967
01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.182
I'm 6, by the way.

968
01:00:55.294 --> 01:00:58.354
- What's that?
- You told the lady on the bus I was 5.


969
01:00:58.498 --> 01:01:02.559
I'm not, I'm 6. 
My birthday's soon.

970
01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:08.303
Are you still going
to come to my party?

971
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.978
Yeah, Sebastian, 
I'm gonna be there.

972
01:01:27.493 --> 01:01:28.551
Are you ready?

973
01:01:28.695 --> 01:01:30.822
- Don't worry, I got you.
- Feels good, huh?


974
01:01:30.963 --> 01:01:33.591
Yeah, so go get your
sneakers on and go climb that wall.


975
01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:35.166
- It should be fun.
- Hey.


976
01:01:35.301 --> 01:01:36.393
Let's go, sweetheart.

977
01:01:36.536 --> 01:01:38.197
- Hi.
- Hey.


978
01:01:38.337 --> 01:01:39.395
- How are you?
- Good.


979
01:01:41.107 --> 01:01:45.271
Um, can we talk about the other night?
Uh, I haven't been able to sleep.


980
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:46.742
The energy thing.

981
01:01:46.879 --> 01:01:48.471
Wally, can we please just forget that?

982
01:01:48.614 --> 01:01:52.607
I definitely think it's worth talking about
because it's certainly something that--


983
01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.185
- Hi.
- Now, that's a party.


984
01:01:55.722 --> 01:01:57.485
Who says a small wall
can't be invigorating?


985
01:01:57.623 --> 01:01:58.681
I don't know.

986
01:01:59.392 --> 01:02:01.257
- I was just--
- Wally, do you remember Roland?


987
01:02:01.627 --> 01:02:03.959
- Baba ganoush.
- Baba ganoush?


988
01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:06.292
You had baba ganoush
all over your shirt.


989
01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:08.992
Kassie's party a few years back.
You were hysterical. Ha, ha.


990
01:02:09.602 --> 01:02:12.127
Yeah. What a memory.

991
01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.761
- Thank you.
- Hey, where's Sebastian?


992
01:02:13.906 --> 01:02:16.704
- I wanna give him this gift.
- He's right over there.


993
01:02:16.843 --> 01:02:19.209
- Put it on. Seriously.
- No.


994
01:02:19.879 --> 01:02:22.006
- Let me take that for you.
- That's okay, I got this.


995
01:02:22.148 --> 01:02:24.616
No, come on,
I'll put it with the rest of the other gifts.


996
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:26.343
- Okay, you got it now.
- Great.


997
01:02:27.086 --> 01:02:30.283
- All right, gifts ahoy.
- Roland's here.


998
01:02:30.423 --> 01:02:32.050
- Yeah. So--
- And in charge of the gifts.


999
01:02:32.191 --> 01:02:34.455
- And what have you got on today?
- What?


1000
01:02:34.594 --> 01:02:36.186
- It's a rock-climbing outfit.
- Is it?


1001
01:02:36.329 --> 01:02:38.593
Yeah, Roland got it for me
because it was--


1002
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:40.460
Listen, come on, be nice.

1003
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.296
Pretty aerodynamic.
Lot of wind up there?


1004
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.829
- Can you--? Never mind.
- Fantastic, okay.


1005
01:02:45.972 --> 01:02:48.202
- I don't wanna climb the wall.
- What?


1006
01:02:48.341 --> 01:02:52.801
- No, but I promise you it's gonna be fun.
- I don't think so.


1007
01:02:52.945 --> 01:02:55.470
Sebastian, the whole reason
we're having your party here


1008
01:02:55.615 --> 01:02:57.606
is to climb the wall.

1009
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.980
We don't want the wall to go to waste,
now, do we?


1010
01:03:00.953 --> 01:03:02.284
You feeling it?

1011
01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:05.549
So where did Sebastian
really wanna throw his party?


1012
01:03:05.691 --> 01:03:07.318
A kill shelter.

1013
01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:09.052
A kill shelter?

1014
01:03:09.195 --> 01:03:12.631
It's like a last-stop dog shelter before they,
you know.


1015
01:03:12.765 --> 01:03:15.859
Anyway, and he thought
it would compel people to save dogs, but--


1016
01:03:16.002 --> 01:03:17.799
- Smart.
- But this is good for him, you know?


1017
01:03:17.937 --> 01:03:20.770
- Because it gets him active and athletic.
- It's too high! No!


1018
01:03:20.907 --> 01:03:22.602
- I get it.
- What is he doing?


1019
01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:26.402
- Get me down!
- Sebastian, that's too high.


1020
01:03:26.546 --> 01:03:27.672
- Mom!
- He's up too high.


1021
01:03:27.814 --> 01:03:30.009
Just let go of the wall, man,
the harness will hold you.


1022
01:03:30.149 --> 01:03:31.707
Just do what he says and let go.

1023
01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:36.083
- What if it breaks?
- The most important thing is to have fun.


1024
01:03:36.455 --> 01:03:38.355
- Yes.
- I don't want to.


1025
01:03:38.491 --> 01:03:41.790
Sebastian, you're gonna be okay, pal.
Just count to three and let go.


1026
01:03:41.928 --> 01:03:43.293
I'm scared.

1027
01:03:44.831 --> 01:03:46.458
I got this.

1028
01:03:46.599 --> 01:03:48.624
I'm coming, buddy. All right.

1029
01:03:48.768 --> 01:03:52.260
- It's not Everest, chief, relax.
- I got it, guys.


1030
01:03:52.405 --> 01:03:53.929
- Yeah.
- Get away from me.


1031
01:03:54.073 --> 01:03:55.131
I'm gonna get you.

1032
01:03:55.274 --> 01:03:56.571
- No.
- I'll take you down, okay?


1033
01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:58.438
- Stop.
- I'm gonna help you.


1034
01:03:58.578 --> 01:04:01.775
- I got him.
- Let go of me, you big monkey.


1035
01:04:01.914 --> 01:04:03.438
Let me go.

1036
01:04:04.784 --> 01:04:05.842
- Stop.
- Hold on.


1037
01:04:05.985 --> 01:04:10.012
I hate that stupid wall.
And this is the worst birthday party ever.


1038
01:04:11.123 --> 01:04:14.923
- Mommy, I don't wanna be here.
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Are you okay?


1039
01:04:15.428 --> 01:04:17.123
You're fine.

1040
01:04:17.263 --> 01:04:20.494
You're all right. You're okay. I'm sorry.

1041
01:04:23.102 --> 01:04:24.592
It's okay. All right, don't worry.

1042
01:04:24.737 --> 01:04:27.137
Come on, honey, let's go--
Let's go wash you up.


1043
01:04:32.645 --> 01:04:37.139
Boy, that was an unfortunate one for you,
but he'll be all right, you know?


1044
01:04:37.283 --> 01:04:38.773
Yeah.

1045
01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.545
Yeah.

1046
01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.011
Hey, I don't know you very well.

1047
01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:45.623
What do you say we get a drink
after this?


1048
01:04:46.893 --> 01:04:49.418
- Um...
- All right.


1049
01:04:53.566 --> 01:04:54.367
Oh, it's just the most beautiful place
on Earth.


1050
01:04:54.367 --> 01:04:56.665
Oh, it's just the most beautiful place
on Earth.


1051
01:04:56.802 --> 01:05:00.101
- Have you ever been to Michigan, Wally?
- I went to Detroit for a meeting.


1052
01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:02.264
Oh.
I'm talking about the upper peninsula.


1053
01:05:02.408 --> 01:05:04.342
I've got a little cabin there
on Neebish Island.


1054
01:05:04.477 --> 01:05:06.707
Been in the family for 30 years.

1055
01:05:06.846 --> 01:05:10.145
I'm thinking of taking Kassie there.
I know it's early, but I'm really feeling it.


1056
01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:12.717
I mean, what do you think?
You want another beer?


1057
01:05:13.085 --> 01:05:14.279
No, no, no, thank you.

1058
01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.014
- You sure?
- Yeah, and I do have to go.


1059
01:05:17.156 --> 01:05:21.320
Uh, you know, hey, listen,
I'm so happy, uh, that we did this.


1060
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.984
The kid hates me, Wally.

1061
01:05:24.664 --> 01:05:29.465
No, no, no.
No, I don't think, uh, Sebastian hates you.


1062
01:05:29.602 --> 01:05:32.196
No, no, he does.
He's told me a couple times.


1063
01:05:32.538 --> 01:05:34.335
Oh, well, um...

1064
01:05:35.074 --> 01:05:38.305
It's just, oh, man, he's got some, uh...

1065
01:05:39.478 --> 01:05:41.673
- Rough edges?
- Yeah, that's it, yeah. I mean, he's...


1066
01:05:41.814 --> 01:05:45.648
He worries a lot, he questions everything.
He's really...


1067
01:05:45.785 --> 01:05:47.980
- Neurotic?
- Yes, that's the word.


1068
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.917
So, what's the problem?

1069
01:05:51.157 --> 01:05:53.489
Well, I don't really relate to that.

1070
01:05:53.626 --> 01:05:54.957
Well...

1071
01:05:57.863 --> 01:06:01.594
Neurotic is simply an intense form
of introspection, okay?


1072
01:06:01.734 --> 01:06:03.565
So you're basically calling him
introspective,


1073
01:06:03.703 --> 01:06:05.671
and being introspective is good, okay?

1074
01:06:05.805 --> 01:06:09.263
It's walking around with an opinion,
with a point of view,


1075
01:06:09.408 --> 01:06:12.502
- with some sort of nice kind of direction.
- Yeah, yeah. You've got it too.


1076
01:06:12.645 --> 01:06:15.205
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, those rough edges.


1077
01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:17.282
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's beautiful.


1078
01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:20.785
Thanks. Hey, what's not beautiful to you?
You know?


1079
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.584
See? You did it again.
That's it, you got that focus.


1080
01:06:25.725 --> 01:06:29.718
But that's how we're alike, Wally,
we're both determined.


1081
01:06:29.862 --> 01:06:33.889
Sebastian may be, uh,
resistant to me now, but I'll get through.


1082
01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:37.093
Life throws you curveballs,
that's for sure, right?


1083
01:06:37.236 --> 01:06:39.568
I mean, a few months ago,
I was planning on having children


1084
01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:41.935
with a woman
who I'm pretty sure I'll never see again.


1085
01:06:43.075 --> 01:06:44.542
A few months ago?

1086
01:06:44.677 --> 01:06:46.076
- Yep.
- That's it, huh?


1087
01:06:46.212 --> 01:06:49.648
And now I'm crazy about a woman
who paid me for my sperm.


1088
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.411
How about that curveball?

1089
01:06:52.852 --> 01:06:54.285
Bam!

1090
01:06:54.954 --> 01:06:58.481
Sebastian's gonna get through this.
We're gonna lick this thing.


1091
01:06:58.624 --> 01:07:02.822
He doesn't need to have this dark cloud
hanging over his head.


1092
01:07:02.962 --> 01:07:04.589
What do you think,
you want another beer?


1093
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.823
Oh, the guy was just--
He just would not stop.


1094
01:07:06.966 --> 01:07:08.661
He just kept going
and talking and talking.


1095
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.929
You know, he thinks that it's his kid.
He thinks that he's my best friend.


1096
01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:15.507
Wants me to give him advice on how
to be a better father to my son, you know?


1097
01:07:15.641 --> 01:07:17.438
It's just like a nightmare.
He's e-mailing me.


1098
01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:20.306
He's smiling at me all the time.
He's hitting me with the big teeth.


1099
01:07:20.446 --> 01:07:22.710
- Wants me to go fly-fishing with him.
- Yeah, and why--?


1100
01:07:22.848 --> 01:07:24.315
I don't understand. 
Why are we here?

1101
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:27.419
Because I gotta exchange this frame.
Sebastian wants one from the new line.


1102
01:07:27.553 --> 01:07:30.681
- It's a sterling-silver 5-by-7.
- Oh, I see.


1103
01:07:30.823 --> 01:07:33.485
Well, that's so nice that
you're taking an interest in his hobbies,


1104
01:07:33.626 --> 01:07:36.424
but, um, listen,
I think the first order of business


1105
01:07:36.562 --> 01:07:38.530
is for you to take care of this thing
with Kassie.


1106
01:07:38.664 --> 01:07:40.325
Why are we waiting? Why the wait?

1107
01:07:40.466 --> 01:07:42.832
Please, I know that, all right?
I've been trying to do that.


1108
01:07:42.968 --> 01:07:45.664
- But everything is all turned around now.
- Turned around?


1109
01:07:46.472 --> 01:07:49.168
I'm turned around.

1110
01:07:49.308 --> 01:07:52.505
That night,
she said she thought we had energy.


1111
01:07:52.645 --> 01:07:55.705
Ooh. That's a new twist.
Never heard that before.


1112
01:07:55.848 --> 01:07:56.906
It was very weird though.

1113
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:59.074
Her mouth is saying
she's spending time with Roland,


1114
01:07:59.218 --> 01:08:00.947
but her eyes are screaming, "Save me!"

1115
01:08:01.087 --> 01:08:03.715
Ah. So go with that. 
Go with the eyes.

1116
01:08:03.856 --> 01:08:07.724
And now I think
that I have feelings for her.


1117
01:08:08.761 --> 01:08:12.458
Really? You think so?
It's only been, uh, 13 years.


1118
01:08:12.932 --> 01:08:15.298
Please, I know you've been saying that
for a very long time.


1119
01:08:15.434 --> 01:08:17.902
- Now I'm finally saying it.
- Well, this is all good news.


1120
01:08:18.037 --> 01:08:20.369
That's just-- You're in love
with the mother of your child.


1121
01:08:20.506 --> 01:08:21.996
Meanwhile, she's falling for Roland.

1122
01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:24.974
And I know that I could save all of this
by just telling her the truth,


1123
01:08:25.111 --> 01:08:27.978
but if I do that, 
I lose everything, right?

1124
01:08:29.381 --> 01:08:31.281
And if you don't?

1125
01:08:31.784 --> 01:08:34.912
Then I'll never be more
than Uncle Wally.


1126
01:08:36.122 --> 01:08:37.248
That's no good.

1127
01:08:37.389 --> 01:08:39.152
- Hi, excuse me.
- Yes?


1128
01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:42.055
This is old, this is new.
I'd like this instead of this.


1129
01:08:42.194 --> 01:08:43.252
- Yes?
- Okay.


1130
01:08:52.404 --> 01:08:54.372
Clearly, the assets in that fund were not--

1131
01:08:55.708 --> 01:08:56.868
Hang on.

1132
01:08:57.009 --> 01:08:59.443
I gotta take this. 
Sorry, hold on.

1133
01:09:00.079 --> 01:09:01.410
- Hello?
- Wally?


1134
01:09:01.547 --> 01:09:03.708
- Hi.
- Oh, thank God you picked up. Okay.


1135
01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:08.752
- I'm in Michigan, and, um--
- Oh, at, uh, Camp Roland, huh?


1136
01:09:08.888 --> 01:09:12.551
Uh, yes, Wally, I'm with Roland.
He's got a cabin up here.


1137
01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:14.488
Been in the family for 30 years.

1138
01:09:14.627 --> 01:09:17.425
Yeah, yeah, it has been.
How do you know that?


1139
01:09:17.563 --> 01:09:21.021
- He told me.
- I didn't know that you guys, uh, spoke.


1140
01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:23.601
- Yeah, we're very, very close.
- Oh. Um...


1141
01:09:25.771 --> 01:09:28.569
- What was that buzzing noise?
- I have to feed the phone.


1142
01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:32.268
- They don't have cell service up there?
- Well, apparently not on this island.


1143
01:09:32.411 --> 01:09:36.472
So, Wally, Sebastian wanted to go
and spend the weekend with Liam.


1144
01:09:36.615 --> 01:09:39.584
And since he's been having some trouble
making friends, I let him do it.


1145
01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:44.655
But then Liam's mom called me
and told me that Sebastian has lice.


1146
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:47.759
- Lice?
- Calm down, Wally, it's lice.


1147
01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:49.326
I did not say leprosy, okay?

1148
01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:53.397
Would you please not Wally this
into a situation worse than it already is?


1149
01:09:53.532 --> 01:09:55.591
Hang on,
did you just use my name as a verb?


1150
01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:58.567
Yeah, yeah, I did. 
I do that sometimes.

1151
01:09:58.704 --> 01:10:01.104
Listen, Wally,
can you please, please help me out?


1152
01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.732
I trust you, and you're the only person
currently in New York City


1153
01:10:04.877 --> 01:10:06.276
that he can stand.

1154
01:10:06.412 --> 01:10:08.437
I've been beating myself up
about this entire thing.


1155
01:10:08.581 --> 01:10:10.845
I have a--
I'm out the first flight tomorrow.


1156
01:10:10.983 --> 01:10:12.917
There's no flights tonight, so I really--

1157
01:10:13.052 --> 01:10:14.781
- You know, I'm--
- Okay, all right. Enough.


1158
01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.081
I pick him up,
I take him to the emergency room?


1159
01:10:17.223 --> 01:10:19.248
You don't take him
to the emergency room. It's lice.


1160
01:10:19.391 --> 01:10:22.883
Okay, so your place
and just plant him in front of the Tv?


1161
01:10:23.028 --> 01:10:25.223
- What do you want from me?
- Yeah, that would be great.


1162
01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:28.527
But there's a couple more things that
you're gonna have to do before that, okay?


1163
01:10:28.667 --> 01:10:31.329
Do you, um...? 
Do you have a pen?

1164
01:10:40.646 --> 01:10:43.046
All right, don't move, 
I'll be right back.

1165
01:10:53.025 --> 01:10:55.516
After you've picked up
Sebastian, stop at Duane Reade.


1166
01:10:55.661 --> 01:10:56.992
There's one on our corner.

1167
01:10:57.129 --> 01:11:02.590
Buy a box of heavy-duty garbage bags,
shower caps, and the lice medicine.


1168
01:11:02.735 --> 01:11:04.703
The doctor already called in
a prescription.


1169
01:11:04.837 --> 01:11:06.270
Here we go, Aisle 10. Where is it?

1170
01:11:06.405 --> 01:11:09.101
There we go, there's the Tide,
where's the trash bags?


1171
01:11:09.241 --> 01:11:11.402
- Trash bags are right there.
- There we go.


1172
01:11:11.543 --> 01:11:13.943
Yellow drawstring. Boom.

1173
01:11:14.079 --> 01:11:15.478
When you get to my place,

1174
01:11:16.081 --> 01:11:19.073
stuff all of his clothes in a trash bag
while he gets in the tub.


1175
01:11:19.218 --> 01:11:22.016
Here we go. All right, arms up, arms up.
There we go.


1176
01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:25.317
And now I'll get you to sit down over here.
We're gonna take off your pants.


1177
01:11:25.457 --> 01:11:30.224
Okay, real good, there we go.
And now let's get in the bathroom.


1178
01:11:32.097 --> 01:11:35.225
Make sure he keeps the stuff
on his head for only ten minutes.


1179
01:11:35.367 --> 01:11:39.326
And whatever you do,
don't get it in his eyes.


1180
01:11:39.471 --> 01:11:40.529
And while he's doing that,

1181
01:11:40.673 --> 01:11:43.335
you can strip both beds of pillowcases,
comforters and sheets.


1182
01:11:43.475 --> 01:11:46.672
All right, we just gotta get
these few little things in here, please.


1183
01:11:46.812 --> 01:11:50.805
And let me get this.
And I'll see you in a minute, okay?


1184
01:11:50.949 --> 01:11:53.713
And then bag up all of
the throw pillows and stuffed animals.


1185
01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:58.755
Make sure those bags are shut airtight
so those lice will suffocate.


1186
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:01.587
And throw everything in the wash
at the hottest temperature.


1187
01:12:01.727 --> 01:12:03.194
Pass me the detergent, please.

1188
01:12:03.329 --> 01:12:05.889
This is not
enough steps. Can we add some more?


1189
01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:08.158
Please just let me shave his head
and be done with it.


1190
01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.097
- Wally.
- Okay, okay.


1191
01:12:10.235 --> 01:12:14.899
But whatever you do, Wally,
try not to make a big deal out of it.


1192
01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:18.138
And make sure to follow the instructions
and wash his hair.


1193
01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:25.608
Everything okay? You all right?
Are you doing okay?


1194
01:12:27.553 --> 01:12:31.114
Oh, and just one more thing,
and it's sort of the worst part.


1195
01:12:33.292 --> 01:12:35.556
There's this little comb.

1196
01:12:35.694 --> 01:12:39.095
Oh, my God, this cannot be happening.

1197
01:12:39.732 --> 01:12:40.790
- What?
- No, no, no.


1198
01:12:40.933 --> 01:12:44.892
Just keep looking that way, pal.
Nothing's going on. Everything's good.


1199
01:12:48.774 --> 01:12:52.471
Are they everywhere?
Are they climbing all over my head?


1200
01:12:52.611 --> 01:12:53.976
Huh? No, they're fine.

1201
01:12:54.113 --> 01:12:57.412
They're absolute-- You're fine.
Everything's okay.


1202
01:12:57.549 --> 01:12:58.675
Are you gonna throw up?

1203
01:12:58.817 --> 01:13:01.513
No, I'm not gonna throw up.
I'm busy killing lice.


1204
01:13:02.121 --> 01:13:05.921
- Did you find some?
- I think so.


1205
01:13:06.492 --> 01:13:08.221
I got them.

1206
01:13:13.399 --> 01:13:16.493
All right, hot out of the dryer.

1207
01:13:16.635 --> 01:13:20.503
I think we are now officially deliced.

1208
01:13:20.639 --> 01:13:23.472
Or "-loused," right? "Deloused"?

1209
01:13:23.609 --> 01:13:26.339
Whatever it is,
we're down to DEFCON 1.


1210
01:13:26.712 --> 01:13:30.614
Or is it 5?
Can never figure out which way that goes.


1211
01:13:30.749 --> 01:13:32.307
All right, good night.

1212
01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:37.311
Sweet dreams, okay?

1213
01:13:38.924 --> 01:13:40.949
This is your collection, right? Huh?

1214
01:13:45.097 --> 01:13:47.998
Why don't you wanna use any
of these frames?


1215
01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:51.363
Why does everyone ask me that?

1216
01:13:53.005 --> 01:13:55.940
Because, you know,
people like to put their own pictures


1217
01:13:56.074 --> 01:13:57.905
inside their frames.

1218
01:13:59.445 --> 01:14:01.640
But they already have pictures in them.

1219
01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.805
That's true,
but you don't know any of these people.


1220
01:14:03.949 --> 01:14:05.382
Sure I do.

1221
01:14:05.884 --> 01:14:10.878
See, like these people.
This is the Owen family.


1222
01:14:11.023 --> 01:14:15.323
That's Mr. and Mrs. Owen,
and those are their two kids.


1223
01:14:16.261 --> 01:14:18.593
He studies volcanoes,

1224
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:25.659
and Mrs. Owen used to work for a place
that sells heart medicines for pets.


1225
01:14:26.371 --> 01:14:27.929
Mm-hm.

1226
01:14:28.373 --> 01:14:30.500
Well, that's funny,
because Mr. and Mrs. Owen


1227
01:14:30.642 --> 01:14:33.042
look like third-rate
stock-photography models to me.


1228
01:14:34.813 --> 01:14:36.337
That's my grandfather.

1229
01:14:39.818 --> 01:14:41.718
- Which one, right here?
- Yeah.


1230
01:14:41.854 --> 01:14:43.583
This guy?

1231
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:46.958
He's my father's dad.

1232
01:14:47.726 --> 01:14:49.387
He owns a boat.

1233
01:14:49.528 --> 01:14:53.521
He takes it out every day
to go fishing for sharks.


1234
01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:56.327
And he knows a lot.

1235
01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:01.901
Did you know
that sharks don't have bones?


1236
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.474
No, but I do now.

1237
01:15:06.411 --> 01:15:08.106
That's my Uncle Rick.

1238
01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:11.112
He's my father's younger brother.

1239
01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:13.980
- This guy here?
- Yeah.


1240
01:15:15.954 --> 01:15:19.082
He got me an iPod for my birthday.

1241
01:15:19.591 --> 01:15:25.359
But I think he stole it from somebody
because it already had music on it.


1242
01:15:29.434 --> 01:15:31.664
What's your dad's family like?

1243
01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:35.472
I don't know. I never met them.

1244
01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:37.572
Why not?

1245
01:15:38.744 --> 01:15:41.042
My father left when I was...

1246
01:15:41.213 --> 01:15:43.613
When I was pretty young.

1247
01:16:12.678 --> 01:16:14.873
You can keep it.

1248
01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:29.457
Sweet dreams.

1249
01:16:38.236 --> 01:16:40.431
See, now, I think you put
too much flour in that, right?


1250
01:16:40.572 --> 01:16:43.473
What you've got there is like a--
It's more like a paste, right?


1251
01:16:43.609 --> 01:16:45.474
I mean, we could spackle these walls
with that.


1252
01:16:45.611 --> 01:16:47.875
I think you need to put
a little bit more water in that.


1253
01:16:48.013 --> 01:16:49.071
- All right?
- Okay.


1254
01:16:49.214 --> 01:16:51.079
Let's think of something else
for the pancakes.


1255
01:16:52.417 --> 01:16:53.714
What about, um, chocolate chips?

1256
01:16:53.852 --> 01:16:56.616
Your mom got any of those?
Or what about peanut butter?


1257
01:16:56.755 --> 01:16:58.120
- Maybe.
- Or cheese.


1258
01:16:58.256 --> 01:16:59.951
Let's go the other way with it, right?

1259
01:17:00.092 --> 01:17:02.390
Let's make it a little bit more
of a lunch pancake, right?


1260
01:17:02.527 --> 01:17:05.894
- Why not? You like cheese?
- Let's put lice in the batter.


1261
01:17:06.331 --> 01:17:09.926
What is so funny to you
about the concept of eating your lice?


1262
01:17:10.068 --> 01:17:12.866
- I don't know, it's just funny.
- Are you looking for texture?


1263
01:17:13.005 --> 01:17:15.974
If we burn them, you get a little crunch.
Keep your lice out of it.


1264
01:17:16.108 --> 01:17:18.008
- Hi, hey.
- Hello.


1265
01:17:18.143 --> 01:17:21.840
- Mommy, I wanna show you the dead lice.
- Come here, let me see that.


1266
01:17:22.247 --> 01:17:23.680
- Come here.
- You're home.


1267
01:17:23.815 --> 01:17:25.578
What do you have in that jar? Lice?

1268
01:17:25.717 --> 01:17:26.911
- Lice.
- Are you kidding me?


1269
01:17:27.052 --> 01:17:30.954
- Wally hunted them and killed them all.
- Let me see. I'm so sorry I wasn't here.


1270
01:17:31.089 --> 01:17:33.421
- Is it all out?
- Yeah.


1271
01:17:33.925 --> 01:17:34.983
- Oh, I love you.
- Me too.


1272
01:17:35.127 --> 01:17:37.652
I'm gonna take the dead lice
to watch Tv.


1273
01:17:37.796 --> 01:17:38.956
That's a cute look.

1274
01:17:39.798 --> 01:17:41.857
Oh, this is, um...

1275
01:17:42.434 --> 01:17:45.130
I was starting to feel itchy,
so I used a little bit of the shampoo.


1276
01:17:45.537 --> 01:17:47.129
You don't have lice.

1277
01:17:47.873 --> 01:17:51.809
- Uh, I could. I could actually have lice.
- You don't have lice.


1278
01:17:51.943 --> 01:17:55.709
And I really thank you.
I appreciate you taking care of all this.


1279
01:17:55.847 --> 01:17:58.247
- Thanks for taking care of him.
- Yeah, you're welcome.


1280
01:17:58.383 --> 01:18:00.943
- How was that weekend?
- It was good.


1281
01:18:01.086 --> 01:18:05.216
It was good. It was really beautiful.
It's quiet, it's on the lake and...


1282
01:18:05.357 --> 01:18:07.791
You know,
his grandfather actually built the cabin


1283
01:18:07.926 --> 01:18:10.019
from logs that they milled
on the property, and so...


1284
01:18:13.065 --> 01:18:17.126
And we're gonna go, I think,
in like two weeks, take Sebastian.


1285
01:18:19.037 --> 01:18:20.732
Really? That's--

1286
01:18:20.872 --> 01:18:22.965
- It's getting serious, huh?
- Yeah.


1287
01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:28.906
We're actually, um,
thinking about moving in together.


1288
01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:33.641
That's...

1289
01:18:33.785 --> 01:18:36.413
I mean, you know, Kassie, I...

1290
01:18:36.555 --> 01:18:38.989
- That's a mistake. I think that this guy...
- No, don't.


1291
01:18:39.124 --> 01:18:40.591
--is a mistake.

1292
01:18:40.726 --> 01:18:42.626
Don't do this. 
Don't ruin this for me.

1293
01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:43.955
- Hang on.
- No.


1294
01:18:44.096 --> 01:18:45.620
Kassie.

1295
01:18:46.164 --> 01:18:49.031
Come on, look, he started the year
married to someone else.


1296
01:18:49.167 --> 01:18:51.567
Look, he's obviously going
through some kind of crap,


1297
01:18:51.703 --> 01:18:53.000
and maybe he doesn't realize it,

1298
01:18:53.138 --> 01:18:56.266
but it looks like he might be using you
and Sebastian to cushion the blow.


1299
01:18:56.408 --> 01:19:00.868
You know that I actually thought
for a brief second that you changed?


1300
01:19:01.012 --> 01:19:02.240
But you haven't.

1301
01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:06.146
I'm trying to move forward with my life,
and you are exactly the same.


1302
01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:08.684
The truth is, I'm actually happy.

1303
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.618
- Are you?
- Yes.


1304
01:19:12.324 --> 01:19:17.125
Roland is a really good guy, all right?
He's supp-- You know what?


1305
01:19:17.262 --> 01:19:19.560
Just because you've never taken a risk
in your entire life


1306
01:19:19.698 --> 01:19:21.359
doesn't mean
you have to rip apart mine.


1307
01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:25.493
At least I'm trying to let somebody in.

1308
01:19:25.637 --> 01:19:27.662
You should try it sometime.

1309
01:19:27.806 --> 01:19:33.108
I mean, unless you have something else
that you would like to say to me.


1310
01:19:34.713 --> 01:19:35.975
Wally?

1311
01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:39.750
Really? Got nothing for me, huh?

1312
01:19:41.286 --> 01:19:45.154
- Nothing?
- Ooh. Do I smell flapjacks?


1313
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:49.158
Hey, Wally,
thanks for being on lice patrol, man.


1314
01:19:49.294 --> 01:19:52.161
You gotta try some of this beer
Grandma made.


1315
01:21:06.738 --> 01:21:08.638
Sebastian, what's going on?
What happened?


1316
01:21:08.773 --> 01:21:12.300
I was at Ethan's birthday party
and I did what you told me to.


1317
01:21:12.811 --> 01:21:15.075
Aaron O'Connor was there.

1318
01:21:15.213 --> 01:21:17.738
I stood up to him and acted crazy.

1319
01:21:22.954 --> 01:21:24.888
Look at your face.

1320
01:21:25.023 --> 01:21:27.491
He punched me
and then threw me into a puddle


1321
01:21:27.626 --> 01:21:29.355
and then hit me again.

1322
01:21:29.494 --> 01:21:31.052
Come here.

1323
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:35.522
- He didn't care that I was crazy.
- Shh. It's okay.


1324
01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:38.636
It didn't work, I tried.

1325
01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:41.330
Where was this? 
Where was the party?

1326
01:21:41.473 --> 01:21:44.442
- At the park.
- Which park?


1327
01:21:44.576 --> 01:21:48.512
- East End.
- East End Park?


1328
01:21:48.647 --> 01:21:51.172
That's like 20 blocks away from here.

1329
01:21:52.183 --> 01:21:54.151
Um, I'm gonna call your mom
to come get you.


1330
01:21:54.286 --> 01:21:57.119
No, Wally, you have to take me home.

1331
01:22:00.292 --> 01:22:02.726
Take me home, Wally.

1332
01:22:04.462 --> 01:22:06.987
Sebastian, why did you come here?

1333
01:22:08.433 --> 01:22:11.630
Because I thought you'd be proud of me.

1334
01:22:19.444 --> 01:22:22.538
Oh, my God, honey,
what happened to you?


1335
01:22:22.681 --> 01:22:25.878
- I got into a fight.
- Sweetie, oh, my God.


1336
01:22:26.017 --> 01:22:28.212
- Why didn't Donna call me?
- It's actually my fault.


1337
01:22:28.353 --> 01:22:32.016
I told him to do something really stupid
a while back, and he listened to me.


1338
01:22:32.157 --> 01:22:35.092
But he's fine.
He came over to my place and--


1339
01:22:35.226 --> 01:22:37.421
He came to you?

1340
01:22:38.129 --> 01:22:40.256
- Yeah, and--
- I thought I heard the doorbell.


1341
01:22:40.398 --> 01:22:43.731
- Oh, what's going on?
- Oh, Roland's family is in town.


1342
01:22:43.868 --> 01:22:45.233
We're just having a little brunch.

1343
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:47.099
- Hey, Wally.
- Who beat the kid?


1344
01:22:48.139 --> 01:22:50.471
- Come on, let's go.
- Sweetie, come here.


1345
01:22:50.608 --> 01:22:52.576
Oh, my God, you're covered in dirt.

1346
01:22:52.711 --> 01:22:54.804
Come on, honey,
let's go get cleaned up.


1347
01:22:54.946 --> 01:22:56.937
We'll fix you up.

1348
01:22:58.683 --> 01:23:00.548
Let's go in the kitchen.

1349
01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:02.880
Somebody punched you?

1350
01:23:03.021 --> 01:23:04.511
- Hey, Wally.
- Yeah?


1351
01:23:04.656 --> 01:23:05.714
What happened?

1352
01:23:05.857 --> 01:23:08.121
- He got in a fight with another kid.
- Oh, that's awful.


1353
01:23:08.259 --> 01:23:10.489
- Yeah.
- You know, but it'll make him stronger.


1354
01:23:10.628 --> 01:23:14.655
I took a few lumps when I was a kid,
usually at the hands of my older brothers.


1355
01:23:14.799 --> 01:23:16.790
- Who are here. You gotta meet them.
- Okay.


1356
01:23:16.935 --> 01:23:18.994
Oh, wait, hold on.

1357
01:23:21.506 --> 01:23:23.235
Check it out.

1358
01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:25.342
Right?

1359
01:23:27.846 --> 01:23:30.644
Stick around. It's gonna get good.

1360
01:23:34.185 --> 01:23:36.050
I'm sorry, Roland.

1361
01:23:39.357 --> 01:23:41.120
For what?

1362
01:23:41.259 --> 01:23:43.159
- Doesn't feel that bad, huh?
- No.


1363
01:23:43.294 --> 01:23:44.522
- Hey.
- Not really?


1364
01:23:44.662 --> 01:23:46.926
- I'm okay.
- I really do need to talk to you.


1365
01:23:47.532 --> 01:23:48.726
Act crazy, Wally?

1366
01:23:48.867 --> 01:23:51.665
Remind me to never to ask you for advice
when I'm being bullied.


1367
01:23:51.803 --> 01:23:54.738
What do you want from me, Debbie?
I'm an idiot. Kassie, this cannot wait.


1368
01:23:55.807 --> 01:23:57.331
- Debbie--?
- I got it, and I'm sorry.


1369
01:23:57.475 --> 01:23:58.533
I will be right back.

1370
01:23:58.676 --> 01:24:01.236
- It was just talk.
- Thanks.


1371
01:24:05.183 --> 01:24:07.447
What got into him?

1372
01:24:08.153 --> 01:24:10.314
You wanna try these peas?

1373
01:24:10.722 --> 01:24:13.088
All right, Wally, what is it?

1374
01:24:13.224 --> 01:24:14.748
I, uh...

1375
01:24:14.893 --> 01:24:18.294
There she is.
Hey, Kass, Wally, come on in.


1376
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:20.421
Yeah, come on in, take a seat.

1377
01:24:20.565 --> 01:24:22.123
- Listen, hang on one second.
- I can't.


1378
01:24:22.267 --> 01:24:25.634
Kass, come on in. You too, Wally.

1379
01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:27.965
- Okay.
- Come on, take a seat.


1380
01:24:28.106 --> 01:24:29.266
Everybody listen up.

1381
01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:30.832
Hush, hush.

1382
01:24:32.877 --> 01:24:34.504
Got a little something to say. Everybody.

1383
01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:37.172
All right.

1384
01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:40.909
A few months ago,

1385
01:24:41.419 --> 01:24:44.980
and I'm not gonna lie,
I was, uh, in a dark place.


1386
01:24:45.857 --> 01:24:48.792
- Um, I was in a world of pain.
- Kassie. Kassie.


1387
01:24:48.927 --> 01:24:50.554
I really have to talk to you.

1388
01:24:50.695 --> 01:24:52.424
- My wife, ex-wife...
- Stop.


1389
01:24:52.564 --> 01:24:57.365
--had left me for reasons
that I don't need to get into now.


1390
01:24:57.502 --> 01:24:59.629
Over here, right now.

1391
01:24:59.771 --> 01:25:02.035
- And then...
- It's gotta be now. Trust me this is real.


1392
01:25:02.173 --> 01:25:03.640
- ...one day...
- Cut it out.


1393
01:25:03.775 --> 01:25:04.867
--the heavens opened,

1394
01:25:06.177 --> 01:25:11.046
and the sweet voice of an angel
is on my phone machine.


1395
01:25:12.884 --> 01:25:17.218
And I am happy to say
to you all that I love,


1396
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:21.022
that my life is whole again.

1397
01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:23.389
Today Sebastian
scared the hell out of me.


1398
01:25:23.528 --> 01:25:25.689
Wally, take a seat,
I'm about to get to the good stuff.


1399
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:28.628
Roland, I'm sorry, you're a really good guy.
I hate to do this to you.


1400
01:25:28.766 --> 01:25:30.859
- Hate to do what?
- Throw this curveball.


1401
01:25:31.603 --> 01:25:35.664
When Sebastian needed someone today,
Kassie, he came to me.


1402
01:25:35.807 --> 01:25:40.210
You know, he needed me.
And I need him.


1403
01:25:40.778 --> 01:25:42.541
All right,
what are you talking about, Wally?


1404
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.478
I'm talking about something
I haven't been able to say before, Kassie.


1405
01:25:45.617 --> 01:25:47.209
I, uh...

1406
01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.317
I hijacked your pregnancy.

1407
01:25:55.393 --> 01:25:57.452
I'm the seed guy.

1408
01:26:03.768 --> 01:26:05.099
What?

1409
01:26:05.236 --> 01:26:11.800
I replaced, uh, Roland's offering
with mine that night,


1410
01:26:11.943 --> 01:26:13.137
your party.

1411
01:26:13.278 --> 01:26:14.905
Um...

1412
01:26:17.348 --> 01:26:19.976
Sebastian's my son.

1413
01:26:20.818 --> 01:26:25.881
I know it was a reckless and careless
and terrible thing to do,


1414
01:26:26.024 --> 01:26:27.514
but, I mean, I panicked, you know.

1415
01:26:27.659 --> 01:26:30.184
I'm not like you, you know.

1416
01:26:30.328 --> 01:26:33.354
You're not afraid of anything.
I'm afraid of everything.


1417
01:26:33.498 --> 01:26:35.363
I can't even take risks, you know,
you said it.


1418
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:38.060
But nothing scares you, Kassie,
and I love that about you.


1419
01:26:39.671 --> 01:26:42.469
I mean, you're gonna hate me
the rest of your life,


1420
01:26:42.607 --> 01:26:45.440
and you're never gonna forgive me,
and I don't expect you to forgive me.


1421
01:26:45.577 --> 01:26:49.104
It just-
- It breaks my heart, it kills me,

1422
01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:52.683
because he's changed me.

1423
01:26:53.017 --> 01:26:56.418
You've changed me, and, um...

1424
01:26:59.724 --> 01:27:01.316
...I love you.

1425
01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.858
I couldn't say that before,
but I'm saying it right now.


1426
01:27:18.509 --> 01:27:21.171
And I'm also saying I'm sorry.

1427
01:27:21.312 --> 01:27:23.610
I'm really sorry.

1428
01:27:30.255 --> 01:27:32.189
Good we got that dirt off.

1429
01:27:36.127 --> 01:27:38.061
Don't ever speak to us again.

1430
01:27:45.737 --> 01:27:47.136
What did I miss?

1431
01:27:55.413 --> 01:27:58.109
Sorry about your proposal, Roland.

1432
01:27:58.249 --> 01:28:00.183
His what?

1433
01:28:01.719 --> 01:28:03.744
Oh, my God.

1434
01:28:14.866 --> 01:28:16.959
I am proud of you.

1435
01:28:57.008 --> 01:29:01.206
- Wally, it's 4 a.m.
- I did it.


1436
01:29:01.346 --> 01:29:03.405
I did the right thing, Leonard.

1437
01:29:03.881 --> 01:29:07.009
- Come on in.
- I faced my fear, I told her.


1438
01:29:07.151 --> 01:29:10.712
That's good, Wally. 
That's real good.

1439
01:29:10.855 --> 01:29:14.689
But I lost her. 
And Sebastian.

1440
01:29:16.594 --> 01:29:18.960
You did the right thing.
I'm proud of you, Wally.


1441
01:29:19.731 --> 01:29:22.393
- It sucks.
- But it'll get better.


1442
01:29:22.533 --> 01:29:26.936
You know,
I'm drinking booze from a deli.


1443
01:29:29.874 --> 01:29:32.069
You should go home, Wally.

1444
01:29:34.712 --> 01:29:36.976
They are my home, Leonard.

1445
01:31:21.419 --> 01:31:25.879
So I've thought about it, and, uh,

1446
01:31:26.023 --> 01:31:30.221
you can't just disappear
from Sebastian's life.


1447
01:31:30.361 --> 01:31:32.124
So...

1448
01:31:32.263 --> 01:31:33.525
You know, he's your son.

1449
01:31:35.933 --> 01:31:39.596
And of course you can see him.

1450
01:31:39.737 --> 01:31:41.932
But it's gonna be on my terms.

1451
01:31:46.143 --> 01:31:47.906
How's he doing?

1452
01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.440
He misses you.

1453
01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:54.279
- I miss him.
- A lot.


1454
01:31:54.418 --> 01:31:57.615
Is he--?
How's he getting along with Roland, okay?


1455
01:31:58.322 --> 01:31:59.914
Yeah.

1456
01:32:01.225 --> 01:32:02.692
I, uh...

1457
01:32:03.561 --> 01:32:05.756
I couldn't go through with that.

1458
01:32:08.866 --> 01:32:11.300
- What happened? What do you mean?
- I don't know.


1459
01:32:14.372 --> 01:32:16.431
He's affectionate.

1460
01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:19.109
Likes me to try new things.

1461
01:32:19.944 --> 01:32:22.538
He doesn't turn into a psycho
when he drinks.


1462
01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.979
He doesn't moan when he eats.

1463
01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:31.684
I turned him down because he's not you.

1464
01:32:48.973 --> 01:32:50.201
Will you marry me?

1465
01:32:52.376 --> 01:32:54.344
Probably.

1466
01:33:17.335 --> 01:33:19.098
Look at us.

1467
01:33:20.404 --> 01:33:22.065
Running around,

1468
01:33:22.206 --> 01:33:26.233
always rushed, always late.

1469
01:33:27.011 --> 01:33:29.741
Guess that's why they call it
the human race.


1470
01:33:31.916 --> 01:33:37.877
But sometimes it slows down just enough
for all the pieces to fall into place.


1471
01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:42.885
Fate works its magic.

1472
01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:47.263
And you're connected.

1473
01:33:48.766 --> 01:33:51.166
- Oh. Hi.
- You smell that?


1474
01:33:51.302 --> 01:33:53.668
- What is that?
- That's charcoal, lighter fluid,


1475
01:33:53.804 --> 01:33:55.032
and my burnt arm hairs.

1476
01:33:55.172 --> 01:33:56.833
- Is that working for you at all?
- Oh.


1477
01:33:58.542 --> 01:34:00.567
Shame there are all these children
around.


1478
01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:01.769
I don't mind an audience.

1479
01:34:01.912 --> 01:34:03.436
- You don't?
- No, they'll seem like my team.


1480
01:34:03.581 --> 01:34:07.483
Oh, God, no. Honey, here, ice cream.
Take this out there, but be careful.


1481
01:34:07.618 --> 01:34:10.678
One of these children has a milk allergy,
and I have no clue which one it is.


1482
01:34:10.821 --> 01:34:12.379
It might be the little blond one there.

1483
01:34:12.523 --> 01:34:14.218
- Just go with a sorbet or something?
- No.


1484
01:34:14.358 --> 01:34:16.053
- You sure?
- No, no.


1485
01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:49.092
- Yeah, Sebastian!
- Whoo!


1486
01:34:49.226 --> 01:34:51.421
Yeah, Sebastian!

1487
01:34:52.096 --> 01:34:53.825
Yeah, yeah.

1488
01:34:53.964 --> 01:34:56.091
- Nice.
- How about that?


1489
01:34:56.233 --> 01:35:01.432
Now, this year, Sebastian has decided
to dedicate his birthday to Doug.


1490
01:35:01.572 --> 01:35:02.630
And Doug is a--

1491
01:35:02.773 --> 01:35:07.710
He's just a wonderful, uh, playful,
three-legged dog,


1492
01:35:07.845 --> 01:35:11.679
and, um, he's in
need of a home, so...

1493
01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:13.743
And?

1494
01:35:15.352 --> 01:35:18.810
And, um, well, Doug is, uh--

1495
01:35:18.956 --> 01:35:22.483
He's next in line at the kill shelter
to be put down.


1496
01:35:22.626 --> 01:35:25.151
Oh, that would be
a horrible way to go.

1497
01:35:25.563 --> 01:35:28.623
- But not dead yet. very much alive.
- That's so good. Positive thinking.


1498
01:35:28.766 --> 01:35:30.028
- Happy puppy.
- And, yeah.


1499
01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:33.136
Let's go ahead and blow out the candles.
Get some of that cake in our face.


1500
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:36.831
I'm not blowing out anything
until someone takes Doug.


1501
01:35:38.142 --> 01:35:39.905
Okay.

1502
01:35:40.044 --> 01:35:41.739
Well, I'll take him.

1503
01:35:41.879 --> 01:35:43.471
- Debbie Epstein.
- Thank you.


1504
01:35:43.614 --> 01:35:44.672
Debbie Epstein.

1505
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:48.346
I can handle him.
He's only got three legs. That's...


1506
01:35:48.486 --> 01:35:50.010
All right.

1507
01:35:50.554 --> 01:35:54.615
- Surprising.
- Okay, make a wish, baby. Come on.


1508
01:35:55.292 --> 01:35:56.691
- Harder.
- There you go.


1509
01:35:56.827 --> 01:35:58.055
Really well done. One more.

1510
01:35:58.195 --> 01:35:59.594
- Here I come.
- Yes.


1511
01:36:00.931 --> 01:36:03.126
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Sebastian.


1512
01:36:03.267 --> 01:36:05.030
I love you, baby, sweet cheeks.

1513
01:36:05.169 --> 01:36:08.696
Every once in a while,
amid all the randomness,


1514
01:36:09.273 --> 01:36:13.767
something unexpected happens,
and it pushes us all forward.


1515
01:36:14.111 --> 01:36:18.605
And the truth is,
what I'm starting to think,


1516
01:36:18.749 --> 01:36:21.377
what I'm starting to feel,

1517
01:36:23.587 --> 01:36:27.182
is that maybe the human race

1518
01:36:28.392 --> 01:36:31.225
isn't a race at all.
