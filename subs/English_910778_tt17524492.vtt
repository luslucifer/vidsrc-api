3
00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:17.611
Okay, on the count of three,
say "lobster!"


4
00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.069
One, two, three--

5
00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:21.570
Lobster!

6
00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:26.278
-Aw.
-But that made me hungry.


7
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:27.444
And we are in Maine--

8
00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:28.695
Do you guys want
to get some lobster?


9
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.528
Yeah, sounds good to me.

10
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:34.194
There is supposed to be a place
around here that's really good--


11
00:00:34.278 --> 00:00:35.570
-I knew you would know.
-...On the next block.


12
00:00:35.653 --> 00:00:36.945
Yes!

13
00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:38.403
-Great.
-Let's go.


14
00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:39.736
Do you guys realize

15
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.611
this is our first get-together
since Italy?


16
00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:43.945
Oh, we really can't count that
as a "get-together."


17
00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:45.361
It was Emma's wedding.

18
00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.903
Oh, technically,
that was still a get-together--


19
00:00:46.987 --> 00:00:49.069
There just wasn't any antiquing.

20
00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:50.319
Well, I made up for that
this time.


21
00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:51.736
Yeah, no kidding!
We did so good, but...


22
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.027
Eh, "but..."

23
00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:55.444
It's not as good
as San Francisco,


24
00:00:55.528 --> 00:00:56.736
is that what
you were about to say?


25
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.027
No. That's it.

26
00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:58.778
Because we found the veil
in San Francisco?


27
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:01.027
Well, you know...

28
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.319
I know you both feel
connection to the veil


29
00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:05.945
because you think

30
00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:07.027
it brought you together
with your significant others.


31
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:08.736
-Well--
-But Finn and I were together


32
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.653
before we found the veil.

33
00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.069
Yeah, speaking of Finn,

34
00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:14.570
you haven't mentioned him much
this weekend.


35
00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:16.111
Is everything okay?

36
00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:17.778
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

37
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:20.278
In fact, he has a job audition

38
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.987
for the Los Angeles Symphony.

39
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.486
Oh. That's a detail
you managed to skip.


40
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.403
I don't really like
thinking about it.


41
00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.820
What happens
if he gets this job?


42
00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:31.486
He's hoping that
I'll move out there with him.


43
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.945
Well, what are you hoping?

44
00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.778
I want him to get the job,
you know?


45
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.194
I mean, it's what he wants,
it's what he deserves.


46
00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:39.820
Yeah.

47
00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:42.111
But moving to Los Angeles
is not exactly what I want.


48
00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:44.403
Well, if ever there was
a quintessential New Yorker,


49
00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:45.361
it's you.

50
00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:49.111
And seriously, what would
the Yankees do without me?


51
00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:50.444
I mean, I really worry
about that.


52
00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:51.820
Okay, I'm just saying,

53
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.319
since you are the one
to have the veil next,


54
00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:56.861
and you never know
what might happen,


55
00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:58.486
you might just want
to make sure it's ready,


56
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.570
you know, just in case.

57
00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.361
Your faith in the veil is...

58
00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:02.528
Inspiring?

59
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:03.695
I was gonna say scary.

60
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.403
-Can we go with sweet?
-Thank you.


61
00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:08.236
I think she's right.

62
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.986
I think you-- you should just
get it fixed.


63
00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.319
It had that little snag in it
when I gave it to you.


64
00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:14.403
All right.
I will take it in.


65
00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:16.069
Okay.

66
00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:17.278
But it's not like I'm gonna
need it anytime too soon.


67
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:19.069
Yes, that is exactly
what I said--


68
00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:20.444
Right before I met Paolo.

69
00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:24.486
Oh! Look! Lobster!

70
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.528
Of course.

71
00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.361
Leland! Good morning.

72
00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:43.820
Ah, good morning.
How was your weekend?


73
00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:44.903
Wonderful.

74
00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:46.403
On the last day, I found

75
00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:49.695
the most incredible

76
00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:51.653
Impressive.

77
00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:53.027
And I think
you're going to be impressed


78
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:54.361
with a document
that's coming in tomorrow.


79
00:02:54.444 --> 00:02:55.403
What is it?

80
00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:56.236
It's a surprise.

81
00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.528
But I will say

82
00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:58.778
it means a lotto me,

83
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.236
as I suspect it will
for you, too.


84
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.736
Well, I'm dying of suspense,
wondering what it is.


85
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.152
Well, I'm sure you have

86
00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:06.944
more pressing things
to get on with, mm?


87
00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:08.152
Yes, I'm still working on
the guest list for the party.


88
00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:09.319
It's hard to narrow down.

89
00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:11.069
I'll leave it
in your capable hands.


90
00:03:11.152 --> 00:03:13.236
Thank you.

91
00:03:16.403 --> 00:03:17.736
-Good morning.
-Morning.


92
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.069
What do we have here?

93
00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:20.194
Uh-huh.

94
00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:22.194
Beautiful.

95
00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:23.444
Aren't they?

96
00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:24.736
Yes, spectacular.

97
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.611
You know, these are gonna
be at the auction


98
00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:26.486
and they're not that expensive.

99
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.778
As tempting as that sounds,

100
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:31.778
I spent the weekend antiquing
with Avery and Emma.


101
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.027
So you'll be
brown-bagging it all week?


102
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:33.902
'Fraid so.

103
00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:35.069
Ah.

104
00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:36.778
Oh! I almost forgot.

105
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.152
They just dropped off
the invitations.


106
00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:40.860
Oh, fantastic.
Yeah, I need to get those out.


107
00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:42.570
Yeah.

108
00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:44.194
-Oh, it looks so nice.
-Yeah, they're nice, right?


109
00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:45.444
Great.

110
00:03:45.528 --> 00:03:47.236
You bringing Finn?

111
00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.653
If he's in town.

112
00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:50.820
I guess
that's a 50/50 proposition.


113
00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:53.069
Always is.

114
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.361
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:02.444 --> 00:04:04.319
I know this is all
a little bit rushed.


116
00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:06.986
And you have to get
to the airport.


117
00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.653
I have a little time
before my flight,


118
00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:09.570
and I thought
we should probably...


119
00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:12.819
...talk about this whole
L.A. thing in person.


120
00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:15.570
It did happen all of a sudden,
didn't it?


121
00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:17.069
It did.

122
00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:18.111
But, you know,
if I get this job,


123
00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:19.361
it means that

124
00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:20.736
I wouldn't have to move
into your place,


125
00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.236
and whatever place
that we find in L.A.,


126
00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.444
that would be... ours.

127
00:04:24.528 --> 00:04:27.152
You know,
this place was hard to find.


128
00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:29.278
Ten blocks from my job,
two blocks from the park.


129
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:30.278
Think of it this way--

130
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:31.860
If I get the job,

131
00:04:31.944 --> 00:04:33.902
we won't have to suffer
through another New York winter.


132
00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:35.986
-"Suffer"?
-Yeah.


133
00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.403
Please. It's not that bad.

134
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.194
And I like the snow.

135
00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:41.444
A little sunshine
would be nice.


136
00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:43.194
But I still have to audition.

137
00:04:43.278 --> 00:04:45.194
This is the L.A. Symphony.

138
00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:46.736
This is Principal Trumpet,

139
00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.403
and there is gonna be
a lot of competition.


140
00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:51.319
They would be lucky
to have you.


141
00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:53.695
Thanks.

142
00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:58.902
Would I still have you, though?

143
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:02.860
I know I'm asking you
to give up a lot.


144
00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:09.486
And you're asking me to live
in all that sunshine...


145
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.069
-
-Just think how I'd get burned!


146
00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:13.403
Come on,
you look great in red.


147
00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:18.653
But there is the possibility
that I won't even get the job,


148
00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:19.902
-so...
-Oh, come on.


149
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.319
You're gonna get it.

150
00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:23.069
You're that good.

151
00:05:23.152 --> 00:05:25.319
I guess we'll find out
in a couple of days.


152
00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:28.236
Yeah.

153
00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.695
And you know, I just think
we should talk about it


154
00:05:30.777 --> 00:05:32.860
some other time,
when we have more time.


155
00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:34.819
I mean, you-- You have to go!
I hate how you're always--


156
00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:36.403
-Yeah. I know, I know.
-...Late for the airport.


157
00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:38.319
I should get going.

158
00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.528
Okay.

159
00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:47.486
Good luck.

160
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.777
I really mean it.

161
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.194
I know you do.

162
00:05:58.944 --> 00:06:00.069
Okay.

163
00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:01.403
Knock 'em dead!

164
00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.695
All right!

165
00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:14.194
-Oh, hey, Stanley--
-Hey.


166
00:06:14.278 --> 00:06:16.528
Did the appraisal come in
on the George Washington letter?


167
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:17.902
Oh, you're on the money,
as usual.


168
00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:20.361
Well, I've worked for Leland
for ten years,


169
00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:21.361
I should be good at this
by now.


170
00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:22.860
Yeah, well,

171
00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:24.152
after a few more years,
you'll be the new Leland.


172
00:06:24.236 --> 00:06:25.735
Whoa! Easy on
the promotion, there.


173
00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.111
I'm happy where I am.

174
00:06:27.194 --> 00:06:28.986
Well, I won't be happy
if you move to L.A.


175
00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:30.735
Aw, 'cause you'd miss me?

176
00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.653
Yeah, no,
but I'd miss the drama.


177
00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:34.278
You're very entertaining.

178
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:35.278
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.


179
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.902
It's Finn.
The audition must be over.


180
00:06:40.403 --> 00:06:42.069
Well, are you gonna
answer it, or...?


181
00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.611
I...

182
00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:44.653
Okay.

183
00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:45.570
Yeah, yeah. Go.

184
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:51.319
Finn, hi! How did it go?

185
00:06:51.403 --> 00:06:52.986
Better than I could've
possibly imagined.


186
00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.653
They offered me the job
on the spot.


187
00:06:54.735 --> 00:06:57.111
Wow! That's incredible.

188
00:06:57.194 --> 00:06:58.777
Yeah, I keep pinching myself,

189
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.944
but, I mean,
this seems to be real.


190
00:07:02.027 --> 00:07:03.694
Hey, listen, I'm gonna spend
an extra couple of days


191
00:07:03.777 --> 00:07:04.735
down here with my family

192
00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:06.236
before I head back.

193
00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.069
They're so excited.

194
00:07:08.152 --> 00:07:10.278
Of course they are.
They must be thrilled.


195
00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:12.528
Send them my best.

196
00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:14.319
I'm really happy for you, Finn.
Congratulations.


197
00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:16.735
Thanks.

198
00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.069
'Kay, well, there's good news
and bad news.


199
00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:21.944
He got the job.

200
00:07:22.027 --> 00:07:23.152
Is that the good news
or the bad news?


201
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.570
I don't know.

202
00:07:28.528 --> 00:07:30.860
My family is so excited
about having me local again.


203
00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:33.027
I'm sure they are.

204
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:33.902
My brother even took me
house-hunting.


205
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:40.111
Look, I know
this all happened really fast,


206
00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:43.278
but you understand I had
to take this opportunity, right?


207
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:45.652
Yes, of course, I understand.

208
00:07:45.735 --> 00:07:46.986
But you have to understand

209
00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:48.610
you're not the only one
who loves their job.


210
00:07:48.694 --> 00:07:50.528
Right?

211
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.777
Well... there are
auction houses in Los Angeles.


212
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.694
They're not the Metropolitan.

213
00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:00.194
I love New York.

214
00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.236
It's... It's who I am.

215
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.735
Yeah.

216
00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:11.528
And I would never
want to change that.


217
00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:17.902
Okay, so what are we saying?

218
00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:21.610
Urn...

219
00:08:21.694 --> 00:08:25.152
maybe this is...

220
00:08:25.236 --> 00:08:26.569
more than just geography,

221
00:08:26.652 --> 00:08:30.236
maybe it's about
who we both are...


222
00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.902
what we want.

223
00:08:33.735 --> 00:08:36.902
And that maybe we want...

224
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:39.944
...different things.

225
00:08:40.027 --> 00:08:41.236
Yeah, I think so.

226
00:08:42.777 --> 00:08:45.528
Yeah.

227
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.152
Look, I know
I have some things here, uh...


228
00:08:50.944 --> 00:08:52.319
I was just getting
used to having them around.


229
00:08:57.735 --> 00:08:59.652
The only thing
I'm gonna miss about New York


230
00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:00.819
is you.

231
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.735
I'm gonna miss you, too.

232
00:09:12.194 --> 00:09:13.403
Hey, come here.

233
00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:16.569
Come on, come here.

234
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:35.278
Hi, Avery.

235
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:36.819
I did some research

236
00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:38.777
and I found the perfect guy
to repair the veil.


237
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.111
He's a master tailor
and he's Italian.


238
00:09:41.194 --> 00:09:42.694
He only sees people
by appointment,


239
00:09:42.777 --> 00:09:44.069
but I did manage
to get you one.


240
00:09:44.152 --> 00:09:45.569
Well, you're not gonna need
that appointment,


241
00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:46.777
because Finn and I
broke up.


242
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.361
What?

243
00:09:48.444 --> 00:09:50.152
You know, we should
get Emma on the phone.


244
00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:52.278
Oh, wait, we can't.
She's teaching.


245
00:09:52.361 --> 00:09:54.194
Tracy, what happened?

246
00:09:54.278 --> 00:09:55.527
He got the job in L.A.

247
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.652
and I wasn't willing
to uproot my life.


248
00:09:57.735 --> 00:09:58.902
I'm sorry.

249
00:09:58.986 --> 00:09:59.902
Yeah, it's okay.

250
00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:02.152
And I'm surprised...

251
00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:03.902
I mean, especially
since you have the veil.


252
00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:05.444
Listen, Avery,

253
00:10:05.527 --> 00:10:07.319
I don't want to burst
your bubble about that veil,


254
00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:10.944
but I hung it up in my closet
and then my relationship ended.


255
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.610
Maybe Finn
just wasn't your soul mate.


256
00:10:12.694 --> 00:10:14.319
I don't think
we have to go there.


257
00:10:14.403 --> 00:10:15.735
Do you mind still getting
the veil fixed?


258
00:10:15.819 --> 00:10:17.735
Yeah, you know. Just in case.

259
00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:19.902
See? That's right.
Hang on to that. "Just in case."


260
00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.278
Avery, I'm kidding.

261
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:22.610
Well, I'm not.

262
00:10:22.694 --> 00:10:24.361
Your appointment
is Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.


263
00:10:24.444 --> 00:10:25.485
I'll text you the address.

264
00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:28.027
Got it.

265
00:10:34.403 --> 00:10:36.278
Hi, Stanley.
Will you please let Leland know


266
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:38.443
that I'm running
a little bit behind?


267
00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:39.610
Yeah, I have one stop to make

268
00:10:39.694 --> 00:10:41.194
and then
I'll be on my way in.


269
00:10:44.152 --> 00:10:45.694
Ah, so you're a Giants fan,
huh?


270
00:10:45.777 --> 00:10:46.694
Oh, yeah, forever.

271
00:10:46.777 --> 00:10:48.152
You're not?

272
00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:49.361
Not really.

273
00:10:49.443 --> 00:10:50.860
You like the Jets?

274
00:10:50.944 --> 00:10:52.236
I do.

275
00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:53.694
Yeah.

276
00:10:53.777 --> 00:10:55.278
I think Zach Wilson's got
a great future with them


277
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.694
as a quarterback-- boom!

278
00:10:56.777 --> 00:10:58.236
Maybe, but the Jets
aren't the Giants.


279
00:10:58.319 --> 00:10:59.443
Never will be.

280
00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:01.069
Yeah. Exactly.

281
00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:03.485
Oh, come on, Luigi.

282
00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:04.610
You're still gonna pin my pants,
though, right?


283
00:11:04.694 --> 00:11:06.111
Oh, excuse me.

284
00:11:06.194 --> 00:11:08.443
Hi. Sorry. I'm Tracy Goodwyn.

285
00:11:08.527 --> 00:11:10.319
I'm the 9:00 appointment,
I'm so sorry that I'm late,


286
00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:12.443
but the subway
broke down at Lex,


287
00:11:12.527 --> 00:11:14.361
so I had to run all the way
across to 5th and 53rd,


288
00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:16.027
and I grabbed it there--

289
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:17.319
I mean, I almost missed it,
but I didn't, so here I am.


290
00:11:17.402 --> 00:11:18.902
Sorry. This gentleman
was a little early


291
00:11:18.986 --> 00:11:20.610
for his appointment,

292
00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:23.194
so I'm afraid
you'll have to wait.


293
00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:24.860
Hey. I'm the 9:30.

294
00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:27.069
I'm only 17 minutes late
for my appointment,


295
00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:29.152
and he's, like, what,

296
00:11:29.236 --> 00:11:30.735
so he's had three minutes
of my time already.


297
00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:32.361
I'll tell you what--
we'll just split the difference,


298
00:11:32.443 --> 00:11:33.986
because it's only gonna take me
two minutes to explain to you


299
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.694
what I need to have done.

300
00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.443
You lost me.

301
00:11:36.527 --> 00:11:38.278
Just like the Giants are gonna
lose to the Jets this year.


302
00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:40.443
The Jets
will never beat them!


303
00:11:40.527 --> 00:11:42.860
The Giants
are just a better team.


304
00:11:42.944 --> 00:11:44.860
Well, we can agree to disagree
on that one.


305
00:11:44.944 --> 00:11:46.443
Tell us, signorina.
What do you think?


306
00:11:46.527 --> 00:11:48.694
I'm with you.
Giants all the way.


307
00:11:50.027 --> 00:11:51.236
Your pants will have to wait.

308
00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:52.819
Ah, I see how it is.

309
00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:54.735
Now, then...
what have you brought me?


310
00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:59.152
Oh, uh, this is a wedding veil
that has a snag in it.


311
00:12:01.944 --> 00:12:03.402
It's right, uh... there.

312
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.278
The workmanship is exquisite.

313
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.443
Gotta be Italian.

314
00:12:09.527 --> 00:12:11.069
You're right, it's from Burano.
Late-19th century.


315
00:12:11.152 --> 00:12:13.069
A piece this beautiful

316
00:12:13.152 --> 00:12:14.443
must've been in your family
for a very long time.


317
00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:16.111
Unfortunately, not my family.

318
00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.027
It belonged
to the Contessa de Marco.


319
00:12:18.111 --> 00:12:21.236
She wore it in a portrait
by Claudio Amici.


320
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.777
That's quite a pedigree.

321
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.694
Oh, sounds
a little made up to me.


322
00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:28.278
Did you just say
that I made up that story?


323
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.735
Well, not necessarily.

324
00:12:29.819 --> 00:12:31.902
You know, maybe somebody else
did along the way.


325
00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:34.485
Actually, this veil has
a very storied history.


326
00:12:35.694 --> 00:12:36.944
If you say so.

327
00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:39.069
-
-Excuse me.


328
00:12:46.986 --> 00:12:48.944
It is a very beautiful veil.

329
00:12:49.027 --> 00:12:50.360
I'm glad you approve.

330
00:12:51.318 --> 00:12:52.360
Nice tux.

331
00:12:52.443 --> 00:12:53.527
Thank you.

332
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.527
So, when is the wedding?

333
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.610
Oh, there's not--
not a wedding.


334
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:58.777
And yet you have a veil.

335
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.152
It's not my--

336
00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:01.443
Well, I mean, I guess
a third of it is mine.


337
00:13:01.527 --> 00:13:02.652
Sort of.

338
00:13:02.735 --> 00:13:04.694
Oh, uh...
what, this third?


339
00:13:04.777 --> 00:13:06.986
No, the third
that doesn't believe in it.


340
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:09.360
See, there's, like, a legend
about the veil,


341
00:13:09.443 --> 00:13:10.569
that it...

342
00:13:10.652 --> 00:13:12.236
never mind.

343
00:13:12.318 --> 00:13:13.735
Ahem. When is your wedding?

344
00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:15.069
Oh, I'm not getting married.

345
00:13:15.152 --> 00:13:16.777
And yet you're in a tuxedo.

346
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.944
I am the best man.

347
00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:20.902
If you say so.

348
00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:23.652
I can have this ready for you
next Tuesday.


349
00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:25.735
Great. Thank you so much.

350
00:13:25.819 --> 00:13:27.735
I left my pins back there.
Be right with you.


351
00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:28.777
Grazie.

352
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.069
Also?

353
00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:32.236
Go, Dolphins.

354
00:13:32.318 --> 00:13:34.069
Dolph-- Luigi!
Dolphins? Come on.


355
00:13:34.152 --> 00:13:36.027
I can't believe it!

356
00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:38.777
Oliver's father
was a client and friend.


357
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.443
He's brought us
a very special document.


358
00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:43.194
It's a piece
I inherited from him,


359
00:13:43.277 --> 00:13:45.027
but, unlike my father,
I'm not a collector.


360
00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:47.735
This is Emma Lazarus's
handwritten first draft...


361
00:13:49.152 --> 00:13:50.111
...of The New Colossus.

362
00:13:51.944 --> 00:13:54.819
I mean, I knew
there was an earlier draft.


363
00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:56.527
I never thought
it would come up for auction.


364
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.652
"Give me your tired,

365
00:13:58.735 --> 00:14:01.569
your poor, your huddled masses,
yearning to breathe free..."


366
00:14:02.902 --> 00:14:04.819
We see it
on the Statue of Liberty,


367
00:14:04.902 --> 00:14:06.152
but to see it
in her own hand...


368
00:14:06.235 --> 00:14:08.111
Her poem made
such a profound effect


369
00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:10.235
on so many immigrant families.

370
00:14:10.318 --> 00:14:11.902
My own included.

371
00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:14.235
We'll send you a contract
this afternoon, Oliver.


372
00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:15.485
Sounds good.

373
00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:16.902
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Thank you both.


374
00:14:16.986 --> 00:14:18.402
Leland.

375
00:14:18.485 --> 00:14:19.944
A lot of collectors
will be interested in that,


376
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.777
especially Carter Wainwright.

377
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.318
He's been looking for a piece
of Americana just like that.


378
00:14:24.402 --> 00:14:25.902
And my fear
is he'll stick it in a vault


379
00:14:25.986 --> 00:14:27.027
and no one will ever see it.

380
00:14:27.111 --> 00:14:28.402
That is exactly
what he's going to do.


381
00:14:28.485 --> 00:14:30.402
But, you know what,

382
00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:32.735
I could probably
reach out to some museums,


383
00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:33.986
maybe get someone

384
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:35.694
to agree to pay
the appraisal price?


385
00:14:35.777 --> 00:14:37.402
I'm not sure
Oliver would agree with that.


386
00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:39.652
But I have your permission
to ask him, right?


387
00:14:39.735 --> 00:14:40.902
-Well--
-I'LL take that as a yes!


388
00:14:40.986 --> 00:14:42.735
Ah.

389
00:14:42.819 --> 00:14:45.485
Go ahead. Go ahead!

390
00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:47.360
Oh! Mr. Wykoff!

391
00:14:47.443 --> 00:14:50.193
Sorry, Mr. Wykoff,
just one second, please!


392
00:14:50.277 --> 00:14:51.443
Yes. Is there a problem?

393
00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:53.111
-I have a proposal for you.
-Okay.


394
00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:54.569
So, what I was thinking was...

395
00:14:57.152 --> 00:14:58.111
Here you go.

396
00:14:58.193 --> 00:15:00.069
Thank you, honey.

397
00:15:00.152 --> 00:15:01.069
How was the wedding?

398
00:15:01.152 --> 00:15:02.860
Oh, it was amazing.

399
00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.235
I don't think I've ever seen
Bobby look so happy.


400
00:15:05.318 --> 00:15:07.569
-Oh!
-Did it give you any ideas?


401
00:15:07.652 --> 00:15:09.777
What, about the new restaurant?

402
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.986
You know
that's not what I mean.


403
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:12.069
Yeah, I know
that's not what you mean,


404
00:15:12.152 --> 00:15:14.610
which is why I'm not answering.

405
00:15:14.694 --> 00:15:17.027
Thank you so much for helping
with the dinner prep.


406
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:19.151
Well, it turns out
we really didn't need to.


407
00:15:19.235 --> 00:15:20.735
Carly's got
everything under control.


408
00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:22.902
Okay, it may
seem like that now,


409
00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.569
but once Nick opens
his new restaurant,


410
00:15:25.652 --> 00:15:27.527
I may need to call on
you and Nonna a lot.


411
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:28.860
I think I'm gonna agree
with Mom on this one.


412
00:15:28.944 --> 00:15:30.694
You're gonna do just fine.

413
00:15:30.777 --> 00:15:32.318
-
-But you might need us.


414
00:15:32.402 --> 00:15:33.944
I'm still not convinced

415
00:15:34.027 --> 00:15:36.610
your idea of mixing Italian
and Asian food together


416
00:15:36.694 --> 00:15:37.777
is gonna work.

417
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.527
It's called fusion.
Nonna, "fusion."


418
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.610
All I know is, it's not
authentically Italian.


419
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.485
Okay, it may not be traditional,

420
00:15:46.569 --> 00:15:48.111
but it is awfully good.

421
00:15:48.193 --> 00:15:49.986
You hear that?
You hear that?


422
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:51.610
Motto bene.

423
00:15:51.694 --> 00:15:53.527
"Molto bene." Ohh...

424
00:15:59.652 --> 00:16:02.443
Mom. Lunch is here.

425
00:16:02.527 --> 00:16:04.735
So, how are you doing?

426
00:16:04.819 --> 00:16:06.402
Oh, you know.

427
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.527
I miss Finn.

428
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.151
Yeah.

429
00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:14.819
But, um, well, I am happy
that I'm still a New Yorker


430
00:16:14.902 --> 00:16:16.277
and don't have to get
on an airplane


431
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.735
to share lunch with my mother.

432
00:16:17.819 --> 00:16:20.402
Aww.

433
00:16:20.485 --> 00:16:23.277
And Zabar's pastrami
would be hard to replace.


434
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.443
A hundred percent.

435
00:16:24.527 --> 00:16:26.777
You know, honey,

436
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.944
when your dad and I
got divorced,


437
00:16:29.027 --> 00:16:31.485
it took me a while
to get my bearings.


438
00:16:31.569 --> 00:16:33.402
Mom, you were married
for 15 years.


439
00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:34.485
Yeah.

440
00:16:34.569 --> 00:16:35.986
Finn and I were together
for two,


441
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:37.986
and if you count
all his touring,


442
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:40.735
we were only together
for a year and a half.


443
00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:42.735
And that's
my longest relationship.


444
00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:45.902
Well, all relationships
have their complications,


445
00:16:45.986 --> 00:16:48.694
but you can't let our divorce
influence your relationship.


446
00:16:48.777 --> 00:16:49.694
That's not what I'm doing.

447
00:16:52.986 --> 00:16:55.193
Is this all new?

448
00:16:55.277 --> 00:16:57.735
They're by a new artist
I'm featuring from Taos.


449
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.235
I really like it.

450
00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:02.151
Yeah.

451
00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:04.443
Now, getting back to you.

452
00:17:04.527 --> 00:17:06.318
Have you thought about
what's next?


453
00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:08.277
I have the party coming up
that I'm planning.


454
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.235
I have to get
the auction together,


455
00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:12.318
and I have to find a museum
that's willing to buy


456
00:17:12.402 --> 00:17:13.235
the Lazarus poem.

457
00:17:13.318 --> 00:17:14.944
I'm busy!

458
00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:18.068
Well, just make sure you leave
some time for yourself.


459
00:17:19.694 --> 00:17:21.902
I have decided to buy
one of those mini trampolines.


460
00:17:21.986 --> 00:17:24.360
Okay...

461
00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:26.944
Stanley says
they're great for destressing,


462
00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:28.318
and they're highly recommended

463
00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:31.485
for high-stress, high-achieving,
busy New Yorkers.


464
00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:33.402
Sounds like
it's right up your alley.


465
00:17:35.485 --> 00:17:37.277
I get the pickle.

466
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.193
-You take it.
-


467
00:17:39.277 --> 00:17:41.151
I think the Lazarus poem

468
00:17:41.235 --> 00:17:43.777
would be perfect
for your special collections.


469
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.569
I know that museums have been
struggling for funding,


470
00:17:46.652 --> 00:17:47.902
and to have an important,

471
00:17:47.986 --> 00:17:49.902
and special, timely piece
like this


472
00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.402
could really--

473
00:17:51.485 --> 00:17:52.610
No, of course.

474
00:17:52.694 --> 00:17:53.944
I understand.

475
00:17:54.026 --> 00:17:55.694
Well, I appreciate your time.

476
00:17:57.151 --> 00:17:59.986
Oh, no. This is gonna be
harder than I thought.


477
00:18:00.068 --> 00:18:00.819
I have good news, bad news.

478
00:18:00.902 --> 00:18:02.569
Hit me.

479
00:18:02.652 --> 00:18:04.151
The bad news is the caterers
that we wanted for the party


480
00:18:04.235 --> 00:18:05.569
just bowed out.

481
00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:07.110
So, for those keeping score,

482
00:18:07.193 --> 00:18:09.277
we can no longer count on
caterers or trumpet players.


483
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.694
Correct, but the good news is,

484
00:18:11.777 --> 00:18:13.735
I have a solution.

485
00:18:17.944 --> 00:18:19.735
-Twirl?
-


486
00:18:19.819 --> 00:18:21.443
-Let's get your coat.
-Okay.


487
00:18:21.527 --> 00:18:22.735
Oh! My phone.

488
00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:24.652
Phone. Grab your phone. Coat.
Adventure!


489
00:18:29.235 --> 00:18:30.610
Everything is so delicious!

490
00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:31.985
Really, though.

491
00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:33.569
The only problem is,
how do we narrow it down?


492
00:18:33.652 --> 00:18:35.235
I don't know, because this
was as good as the carbonara,


493
00:18:35.318 --> 00:18:37.068
which was as good
as the risotto.


494
00:18:37.151 --> 00:18:38.860
-Exactly. I don't know.
-How do we choose?


495
00:18:38.944 --> 00:18:40.151
We have to save
some room for dessert,


496
00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:41.860
because I hear the cannolis
are incredible.


497
00:18:41.944 --> 00:18:44.110
We have to get these people
to cater the party.


498
00:18:44.193 --> 00:18:45.652
See, I knew
you were gonna say that,


499
00:18:45.735 --> 00:18:47.193
so I asked the waiter
if we could talk to the owner.


500
00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:48.902
What if
I hadn't liked the food?


501
00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:49.694
I hadn't gotten there--

502
00:18:49.777 --> 00:18:51.318
But the food is fantastic.

503
00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:56.318
-Tuxedo.
-Wedding veil.


504
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.985
-Is this some sort of code?
-You're the owner?


505
00:19:00.068 --> 00:19:01.110
I am.
The owner and the chef.


506
00:19:01.193 --> 00:19:02.277
Nick Serchio.

507
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.110
Tracy Goodwyn.

508
00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:04.485
And I'm Stanley.

509
00:19:04.569 --> 00:19:05.819
But I'm guessing,
by this greeting,


510
00:19:05.902 --> 00:19:07.193
you two have already met.

511
00:19:08.193 --> 00:19:09.235
Yes, we have.

512
00:19:09.318 --> 00:19:10.318
Yeah, very briefly.

513
00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:11.819
Mm-hmm.

514
00:19:11.902 --> 00:19:14.402
So I understand
you wanted to see me?


515
00:19:14.485 --> 00:19:15.819
Oh, yeah, but that was before
I knew you were you.


516
00:19:15.902 --> 00:19:17.443
Now that we've got
that out of the way...


517
00:19:17.527 --> 00:19:19.110
uh, what'd you want
to see me about?


518
00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:20.402
About the food.

519
00:19:20.485 --> 00:19:23.110
|-|-- we wanted
to compliment you


520
00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:24.443
on how delicious
all of this food is.


521
00:19:24.527 --> 00:19:26.402
-It's very good.
-Thank you.


522
00:19:26.485 --> 00:19:29.443
Yes, and-and we wanted to see
if you could cater a party


523
00:19:29.527 --> 00:19:30.527
at our auction house
on the 17th--


524
00:19:31.694 --> 00:19:34.151
Catering... the 17th?
Uh...


525
00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:35.901
Well, I would have to check
with my sister.


526
00:19:35.985 --> 00:19:37.402
Um, I work with her,

527
00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:39.652
so I'll go do that.

528
00:19:39.735 --> 00:19:41.527
Okay,
yeah, yeah, check with her.


529
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.735
In the meantime, we should
probably order some dessert.


530
00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:45.068
'Kay. I'll send somebody over.

531
00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:46.694
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.


532
00:19:46.777 --> 00:19:47.860
Yeah, fantastic. I hear
the cannolis are really the...


533
00:19:47.943 --> 00:19:49.068
What's going on with you?

534
00:19:49.151 --> 00:19:51.360
Nothing. Nothing at all.

535
00:19:51.443 --> 00:19:53.026
I just realized
that this place is so busy


536
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.235
they probably won't
be able to fit us in.


537
00:19:55.318 --> 00:19:56.527
Well, let's hope they will.

538
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.652
I'm definitely
not doing that job.


539
00:19:58.735 --> 00:19:59.777
What is wrong with you?

540
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.235
What are you talking about?
Nothing.


541
00:20:01.318 --> 00:20:02.777
Just“

542
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.777
Just it feels like she'd be
a very difficult client.


543
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.193
You've had
difficult clients before.


544
00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:09.859
Just think of the exposure
a party like this would give us,


545
00:20:09.943 --> 00:20:12.610
especially since we are about
to open a new restaurant!


546
00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:14.402
You're just like Mom.

547
00:20:16.151 --> 00:20:17.277
And what's with

548
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.485
the wedding veil
and the tuxedo thing?


549
00:20:18.569 --> 00:20:20.819
-It's a long story.
-How long?


550
00:20:20.901 --> 00:20:22.610
-Not that kind of time.
-A|| right.


551
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.985
So... Looks like I will be
available to cater.


552
00:20:29.068 --> 00:20:31.235
Oh. Great.

553
00:20:33.277 --> 00:20:35.360
Good. Yeah. Fantastic.

554
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.235
Why am I the only one
who's excited about this?


555
00:20:45.527 --> 00:20:47.485
I'll get the door for you,
all right?


556
00:20:47.569 --> 00:20:48.652
-A|| right. Thank you.
-You're welcome.


557
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.943
We've gotten so many RSVPs
for the party


558
00:20:53.026 --> 00:20:54.652
and I just sent out
the invitations.


559
00:20:54.735 --> 00:20:57.818
Our little party's turning out
to be quite the social event.


560
00:20:57.901 --> 00:20:59.569
Yeah. I have to talk
to the florist,


561
00:20:59.652 --> 00:21:01.527
I have to confirm
with the valet.


562
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.735
Oh, I have to get ex...
some extra displays--


563
00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:05.652
You know what? I have to get
those earrings to the catalogue


564
00:21:05.735 --> 00:21:07.943
before the catalog
goes to the printer.


565
00:21:08.026 --> 00:21:09.318
The sapphire earrings
that I like?


566
00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:10.569
-Yeah.
-What's the provenance on those?


567
00:21:10.652 --> 00:21:12.068
Because I feel like
I've seen them before.


568
00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:13.735
No provenance. Estate jewelry.
Actually, you know what?


569
00:21:13.818 --> 00:21:14.735
I'm gonna go
to the printers now.


570
00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:16.026
I'll see you later.

571
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.110
What? No, no, no!
You can't go anywhere!


572
00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:17.901
We have an appointment
with the caterer


573
00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.193
to go over the menu.

574
00:21:19.277 --> 00:21:20.859
Oh, right!
Well, can't you go without me?


575
00:21:20.943 --> 00:21:22.193
You can have
some alone time with Tuxedo.


576
00:21:22.277 --> 00:21:23.485
I don't want alone time!

577
00:21:23.569 --> 00:21:24.652
I think he's gonna
be hard to work with,


578
00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:25.985
and I don't need
that kinda stress!


579
00:21:26.068 --> 00:21:27.901
The trampoline would help.
Did it come yet?


580
00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:29.943
-Yes.
-And?


581
00:21:30.026 --> 00:21:31.777
I haven't taken it
out of the box.


582
00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.151
So, the way it works is,

583
00:21:33.235 --> 00:21:34.443
you actually have to take it
out of the box,


584
00:21:34.527 --> 00:21:36.443
and then you hit it.

585
00:21:36.527 --> 00:21:38.610
Okay, so say "hi" to Tuxedo
for me!


586
00:21:42.443 --> 00:21:44.402
-Oh...
-


587
00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:46.735
Swivel or no swivel?

588
00:21:46.818 --> 00:21:48.485
How much does it cost?

589
00:21:48.569 --> 00:21:50.277
Well, this new catering gig
will pay for the swivel stools.


590
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.360
That's one way
of looking at it.


591
00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:52.569
Oh, come on, Nick.

592
00:21:52.652 --> 00:21:54.026
This party
is exactly what we need.


593
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.776
The auction house
is on the Upper West Side,


594
00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:58.068
and that is exactly the type
of clientele we want to attract.


595
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.694
You're right.

596
00:22:00.776 --> 00:22:02.818
I guess I'll just focus
on what's important--


597
00:22:02.901 --> 00:22:04.110
The food
and getting the restaurant open.


598
00:22:04.193 --> 00:22:06.235
And choosing
the right bar stools.


599
00:22:08.235 --> 00:22:09.610
-You're having way too much fun.
-Yep.


600
00:22:09.694 --> 00:22:11.068
Fine. The swivel.

601
00:22:11.151 --> 00:22:12.318
Yes!

602
00:22:12.402 --> 00:22:13.068
Just 'cause
you're making me dizzy.


603
00:22:13.151 --> 00:22:14.402
Right? Cool.

604
00:22:14.485 --> 00:22:16.360
Usually, we don't
make a big deal


605
00:22:16.443 --> 00:22:17.818
out of auction previews,

606
00:22:17.901 --> 00:22:20.193
but we're combining it
with our 25th anniversary.


607
00:22:20.277 --> 00:22:22.943
25? Wow. B-But you haven't
been there that long.


608
00:22:23.026 --> 00:22:24.443
No. I've been there ten years.

609
00:22:24.527 --> 00:22:25.901
I started off as an assistant,

610
00:22:25.985 --> 00:22:28.610
and now I am the Director
of Books and Documents.


611
00:22:28.694 --> 00:22:31.193
Ooh. "Director
of Books and Documents."


612
00:22:31.277 --> 00:22:32.360
That is a fancy title.

613
00:22:32.443 --> 00:22:33.527
It is not "fancy".

614
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.235
And I didn't make it up.

615
00:22:35.318 --> 00:22:36.985
Ah. Touche.

616
00:22:37.068 --> 00:22:39.151
Uh, I owe you an apology.

617
00:22:39.235 --> 00:22:40.859
I was a little bit out of line
the other day.


618
00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:42.318
Thank you.

619
00:22:42.402 --> 00:22:43.527
Me too.

620
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.694
Nah!

621
00:22:45.943 --> 00:22:46.901
-
-Oh, um...


622
00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:48.026
Excuse me. Sorry.

623
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.485
Okay.

624
00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:52.652
So the Morgan Library
turned me down.


625
00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:53.818
How do you get turned down
by a library?


626
00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:55.485
Too many overdue books?

627
00:22:55.569 --> 00:22:57.151
No.

628
00:22:57.235 --> 00:22:59.026
I'm trying to have
a historical document


629
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.569
placed in a museum.

630
00:23:01.652 --> 00:23:03.068
Which one?
I'm a pretty big history buff.


631
00:23:03.151 --> 00:23:05.693
It's an early draft of a poem
by Emma Lazarus.


632
00:23:05.776 --> 00:23:07.652
The one that's on
the Statue of Liberty?


633
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:09.818
"Give me your tired,
your poor


634
00:23:09.901 --> 00:23:10.985
your huddled masses--"
That one?


635
00:23:11.068 --> 00:23:13.110
Wow. Okay,
I underestimated you.


636
00:23:13.193 --> 00:23:14.734
Good for you.

637
00:23:14.818 --> 00:23:16.193
No, I know it,

638
00:23:16.277 --> 00:23:17.901
because my grandmother
immigrated here from Italy


639
00:23:17.985 --> 00:23:19.318
when she was a child,

640
00:23:19.402 --> 00:23:20.527
and the Statue of Liberty
is one of the very first


641
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.443
things she saw
when she came to America.


642
00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:24.859
It's one of the most important
days of her entire life.


643
00:23:24.943 --> 00:23:26.569
It's stories like that
that make me realize


644
00:23:26.652 --> 00:23:29.151
just how important
this is that I'm trying to do.


645
00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:30.235
You want stories?

646
00:23:30.318 --> 00:23:32.193
My nonna's got some stories.

647
00:23:34.026 --> 00:23:34.776
Let's focus
on the menu here, huh?


648
00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:36.235
Okay.

649
00:23:36.318 --> 00:23:37.818
I've thrown a couple new things
at you here.


650
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:40.235
I'm opening a restaurant
called Tesoro Mio,


651
00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:43.527
and it's
an Asian-Italian fusion...


652
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.818
That's really interesting,
and different--


653
00:23:45.901 --> 00:23:47.943
Something I strive for.

654
00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.943
Yeah, me too.

655
00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:51.569
So, check this out...

656
00:23:53.943 --> 00:23:56.569
-Oh!
-Fantastic.


657
00:23:56.651 --> 00:23:58.402
Yeah, look at that.

658
00:24:00.193 --> 00:24:01.818
So? What do you think?

659
00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:05.569
It's a very nice sign.

660
00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:07.818
I thought so, too.
It's a good start, right?


661
00:24:07.901 --> 00:24:09.193
Let's go inside. I want
to show you the rest of it.


662
00:24:09.277 --> 00:24:11.734
Okay, now, you gotta use
your imagination.


663
00:24:11.818 --> 00:24:13.651
Wait until you see the kitchen.

664
00:24:13.734 --> 00:24:14.985
It does everything
but make the sauce.


665
00:24:15.068 --> 00:24:16.569
When we started Da Nonna,

666
00:24:16.651 --> 00:24:17.901
my mother and I
had to make sauce


667
00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:19.402
in a tiny, little apartment.

668
00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:21.110
Ma.

669
00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:23.485
I think the place
is very nice


670
00:24:23.569 --> 00:24:25.235
and I think
Nick is onto something here.


671
00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:28.026
You know, he got a lot
of very important investors


672
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.360
based on his menu
and his cooking.


673
00:24:30.443 --> 00:24:31.527
Eh?

674
00:24:31.609 --> 00:24:32.734
What do you think?

675
00:24:32.818 --> 00:24:34.068
We were just saying

676
00:24:34.151 --> 00:24:35.443
how impressed we are
with the place, honey.


677
00:24:35.527 --> 00:24:37.235
Oh, thanks, Ma.

678
00:24:37.318 --> 00:24:39.235
And proud.
Of both of you.


679
00:24:39.318 --> 00:24:42.068
But are you sure you will be
finished with everything


680
00:24:42.151 --> 00:24:43.485
by the opening?

681
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:45.110
Yeah, we've got, like,
a month, right?


682
00:24:45.193 --> 00:24:46.609
Uh, which reminds me--

683
00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:47.859
I need some artwork
for the walls.


684
00:24:47.943 --> 00:24:50.277
We got plenty of family photos
you could have!


685
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.360
Well, that's, um,
very sweet, Nonna,


686
00:24:52.443 --> 00:24:53.734
but we're going for

687
00:24:53.818 --> 00:24:55.693
a little bit different vibe here
than Da Nonna,


688
00:24:55.776 --> 00:24:57.901
but I'll keep it in mind, huh?
Grazie.


689
00:24:57.985 --> 00:24:59.402
Espresso?

690
00:25:01.527 --> 00:25:03.277
Leland?
I have some good news.


691
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.235
I called every museum
I could think of, as you know,


692
00:25:05.318 --> 00:25:06.943
with no luck.

693
00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:09.151
But I just had a meeting with
the New York History Museum,


694
00:25:09.235 --> 00:25:11.734
and they want to make
the Lazarus poem


695
00:25:11.818 --> 00:25:13.151
part of their permanent exhibit.

696
00:25:13.235 --> 00:25:14.568
Well, that is
wonderful news, Tracy.


697
00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:15.985
Congratulations.

698
00:25:16.068 --> 00:25:19.360
There is a catch.

699
00:25:19.443 --> 00:25:21.110
They can only afford
half the purchase price.


700
00:25:21.193 --> 00:25:22.943
Which means
you have to find someone


701
00:25:23.026 --> 00:25:24.110
who can cover the other half,

702
00:25:24.193 --> 00:25:25.609
and is also willing
to donate it.


703
00:25:25.693 --> 00:25:27.985
Guess it's only
half the money, right?


704
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:30.443
Unfortunately, it doesn't
make it half as easy.


705
00:25:30.527 --> 00:25:32.734
Indeed. Well...

706
00:25:32.818 --> 00:25:35.068
back to work.

707
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:36.443
You can do it.

708
00:25:36.527 --> 00:25:38.568
Yeah. Of course.
No, I understand.


709
00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:40.235
But thank you for your time.

710
00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:45.485
What's wrong?

711
00:25:45.568 --> 00:25:47.651
I'm just about through
my donor list


712
00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:49.110
and I haven't found anyone.

713
00:25:49.193 --> 00:25:50.443
I'm getting nowhere fast

714
00:25:50.526 --> 00:25:51.943
and I am running out of time.

715
00:25:52.026 --> 00:25:53.110
You want to come out with me,

716
00:25:53.193 --> 00:25:54.568
have a drink,
cry on my shoulder?


717
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:56.943
I don't have time to cry
because I'm not giving up.


718
00:25:57.026 --> 00:25:59.151
Maybe I'll just
jump on my trampoline.


719
00:25:59.235 --> 00:26:00.651
You finally took it
out of the box?


720
00:26:00.734 --> 00:26:03.318
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.


721
00:26:03.402 --> 00:26:06.360
Okay, well, I'll be out.
Happy jumping!


722
00:26:06.443 --> 00:26:09.235
I'll be at the restaurant.

723
00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:17.485
Hello.

724
00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:19.318
It's, uh, Nick Serchio,
from Da Nonna's.


725
00:26:19.402 --> 00:26:21.734
Yeah. Hi. I...

726
00:26:21.818 --> 00:26:23.235
I know who you are.

727
00:26:23.318 --> 00:26:24.776
Is everything okay?

728
00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:26.360
You sound like you're
a little bit out of breath.


729
00:26:26.443 --> 00:26:30.277
No. I mean,
I was just a little up and down.


730
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.026
I was jumping on a trampoline.

731
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.859
That's all.

732
00:26:33.943 --> 00:26:35.985
Well, I didn't know
the circus was in town.


733
00:26:36.068 --> 00:26:38.609
I didn't know
chefs were funny.


734
00:26:38.693 --> 00:26:40.068
Well, we have our moments.
Thanks.


735
00:26:40.151 --> 00:26:41.818
A little kitchen humor?

736
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:43.651
What, you don't have
auction house humor?


737
00:26:43.734 --> 00:26:46.901
No. No, no.
All that art and antiquity?


738
00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:48.901
It's very serious.
Sacred, in fact.


739
00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:50.318
Well, sorry. I didn't know.

740
00:26:50.402 --> 00:26:51.693
Stanley is the funny one.

741
00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.360
The sidekick, right?

742
00:26:53.443 --> 00:26:54.235
The guy that I met
at the restaurant with you?


743
00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:56.068
I'm Abbott to his Costello.

744
00:26:56.151 --> 00:26:57.651
Hey. Who's on first?

745
00:26:57.734 --> 00:27:00.651
What's on second.

746
00:27:00.734 --> 00:27:02.068
I didn't know
you'd know that routine.


747
00:27:02.151 --> 00:27:03.901
I'm surprised you do.

748
00:27:03.985 --> 00:27:05.318
People aren't always
who you think they are.


749
00:27:05.402 --> 00:27:06.985
Well, I think
you're still the chef


750
00:27:07.068 --> 00:27:08.110
that's going to be
catering our party.


751
00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:09.901
I am.

752
00:27:09.985 --> 00:27:11.235
That's actually why I called--
I've narrowed it down


753
00:27:11.318 --> 00:27:12.193
to a few recipes
I want you to try.


754
00:27:12.277 --> 00:27:14.693
-When?
-How is Thursday morning?


755
00:27:14.776 --> 00:27:17.235
Yeah, that-- Yeah,
that should be fine for me.


756
00:27:17.318 --> 00:27:19.151
All right.

757
00:27:19.235 --> 00:27:19.901
You're sure you're not bouncing
on the trampoline that morning?


758
00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:21.734
Well, if I am,

759
00:27:21.818 --> 00:27:24.277
it's, uh, you know,
just to build up an appetite.


760
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.277
All right. I'll see you then.

761
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.734
Great.

762
00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:32.943
And here we have

763
00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:36.402
a little shitake mushroom
and umami ravioli.


764
00:27:36.484 --> 00:27:37.859
Wow.

765
00:27:37.943 --> 00:27:39.442
Smells good.

766
00:27:39.526 --> 00:27:41.318
Ah, it's one of my favorites.

767
00:27:41.402 --> 00:27:42.734
You know, I noticed
all the memorabilia


768
00:27:42.818 --> 00:27:43.985
you have back there.

769
00:27:44.068 --> 00:27:45.110
Wow, you weren't kidding
when you said


770
00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:47.318
you were
a major New York history buff.


771
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:48.609
Oh, yeah.

772
00:27:48.693 --> 00:27:50.235
It all started
when my nonna gave me


773
00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:51.734
this little replica
of the Statue of Liberty.


774
00:27:51.818 --> 00:27:53.609
Mm?

775
00:27:53.693 --> 00:27:55.734
-Well?
-Wow.


776
00:27:55.818 --> 00:27:58.026
Wow!

777
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.526
If all your food
tastes like this,


778
00:27:59.609 --> 00:28:01.568
I'm never getting a reservation
at Tesoro Mio.


779
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:03.401
Oh, you know, I may know
somebody that knows somebody


780
00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:04.526
that can get you in.

781
00:28:06.068 --> 00:28:07.693
Oh, this is my sister, Carly.
Carly, Tracy.


782
00:28:07.776 --> 00:28:08.776
'Hi!

783
00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:10.568
Hi. Nice to meet you.

784
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:12.818
Same here. We are very excited
to be catering your event.


785
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:14.484
Oh, well, if the food
is this good,


786
00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:16.068
the crowd is gonna be
really happy.


787
00:28:16.151 --> 00:28:17.818
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying
Nick's new menu,


788
00:28:17.901 --> 00:28:19.193
but I should get these
into the kitchen.


789
00:28:19.277 --> 00:28:20.526
It was lovely to meet you.

790
00:28:20.609 --> 00:28:23.401
See ya. Carly's the eldest
of my three sisters.


791
00:28:23.484 --> 00:28:24.985
Where are the other two?
Locked in the kitchen?


792
00:28:25.068 --> 00:28:26.734
Yes. And we threw away the key.

793
00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:29.442
No, uh, they're in Italy,
actually.


794
00:28:29.526 --> 00:28:31.818
Giuliana is doing some research
for a new cookbook,


795
00:28:31.901 --> 00:28:34.359
and my sister, Monica,
is on a farm,


796
00:28:34.442 --> 00:28:36.110
learning how to make
her own olive oil.


797
00:28:36.193 --> 00:28:37.693
Wow. You have
quite a family.


798
00:28:37.776 --> 00:28:39.609
Yeah, I got pretty lucky
in that department.


799
00:28:39.693 --> 00:28:41.277
How about you?

800
00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:43.068
Oh, I'm an only child,

801
00:28:43.151 --> 00:28:45.026
and my parents are divorced,

802
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.401
and, uh, I just had a break-up
myself, recently.


803
00:28:47.484 --> 00:28:48.776
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

804
00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:50.026
-Mm.
-Uh, divorce?


805
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.277
No, no, we never made it
down the aisle.


806
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:54.235
But you still have
the wedding veil.


807
00:28:54.318 --> 00:28:56.401
Only by default.

808
00:28:56.484 --> 00:28:57.609
Yeah, but wasn't there

809
00:28:57.693 --> 00:28:59.609
some sort of legend
attached to it?


810
00:28:59.693 --> 00:29:00.609
It's silly.
The legend is,


811
00:29:00.693 --> 00:29:02.318
whoever has possession
of the veil


812
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:03.818
is going to fall in love.

813
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:06.151
That's not silly at all.
That's totally legit.


814
00:29:06.235 --> 00:29:07.609
Totally!
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.


815
00:29:07.693 --> 00:29:08.734
Totally legit.

816
00:29:08.818 --> 00:29:09.901
Um...

817
00:29:09.985 --> 00:29:11.943
why don't we have some dessert?

818
00:29:12.026 --> 00:29:13.235
What's this one called again?

819
00:29:13.317 --> 00:29:14.359
"Sfogliatella. "

820
00:29:14.442 --> 00:29:15.401
How do you say it?

821
00:29:15.484 --> 00:29:16.526
Sif-foge-lia...

822
00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:17.526
Sof-fog-lee-at
-Ella.

823
00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:18.776
"Sfogliatella. "

824
00:29:18.859 --> 00:29:20.359
-
-I can't put it all together.


825
00:29:20.442 --> 00:29:22.110
I know I like it,
but I just can't say it.


826
00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:23.359
That's all that matters.

827
00:29:23.442 --> 00:29:24.359
-I'd like to have this
on the menu, too.


828
00:29:24.442 --> 00:29:25.776
-A|| right, done.
-And the cannolis.


829
00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:26.693
Cannolis are on every menu.
Come on.


830
00:29:26.776 --> 00:29:28.693
Perfect! I love it.

831
00:29:28.776 --> 00:29:30.193
That doesn't look so hard.

832
00:29:30.277 --> 00:29:31.110
You want to try filling
one of these?


833
00:29:31.193 --> 00:29:32.442
Seems easy, right?

834
00:29:32.526 --> 00:29:33.818
Grab that chocolate
right there--


835
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:35.277
Grab it by the top,
otherwise it all comes out.


836
00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.943
Oh, yeah, you don't want that.

837
00:29:37.026 --> 00:29:38.151
-A|| right, and just a--
-Oh!


838
00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:39.609
'
-sorry!


839
00:29:39.693 --> 00:29:41.110
I didn't mean to sp--

840
00:29:41.193 --> 00:29:42.943
Not so-
- Not so much filling.

841
00:29:43.026 --> 00:29:44.484
Here, let's get that off.
-Wait, can I taste it first?


842
00:29:44.568 --> 00:29:45.734
Yes.

843
00:29:45.818 --> 00:29:47.359
-Mm!
-That's good, right?


844
00:29:47.442 --> 00:29:48.277
That's really good!

845
00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:50.026
Mm. So delicious.

846
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.609
That's a lot of chocolate.

847
00:29:51.693 --> 00:29:54.068
Okay, so, we've got
the cannolis,


848
00:29:54.151 --> 00:29:55.568
we've got the "s fogliatella. "

849
00:29:56.693 --> 00:29:57.943
Um, other than that...

850
00:29:58.026 --> 00:29:59.442
everything else good
with the menu?


851
00:29:59.526 --> 00:30:01.151
I really think
the menu's perfect.


852
00:30:01.235 --> 00:30:03.818
I'm really happy to check that
off my to-do list.


853
00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:10.193
Um... I... have to get going.

854
00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:12.651
You going to work?

855
00:30:12.734 --> 00:30:14.651
No, no. I took the morning
off from work,


856
00:30:14.734 --> 00:30:15.901
because I'm buying a new rug

857
00:30:15.985 --> 00:30:17.484
and maybe even
a new coffee table


858
00:30:17.568 --> 00:30:18.859
and some new art.

859
00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:20.943
Ooh. Redecorating?

860
00:30:21.026 --> 00:30:22.651
Didn't start out that way,
but then the break-up--


861
00:30:22.734 --> 00:30:25.068
I guess I just wanted
something new.


862
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:27.776
Is that this building
that we're in right now?


863
00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:29.734
This, right here,
is the very first day


864
00:30:29.818 --> 00:30:30.526
that Da Nonna's was opened.

865
00:30:30.609 --> 00:30:31.776
Wow.

866
00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:33.317
That's
my great-great grandmother,


867
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:34.276
great-grandfather,
in the hat right there--


868
00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:35.776
look at that hat!

869
00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:38.401
And that's my grandmother, Gia.

870
00:30:38.484 --> 00:30:41.276
The one who gave you
the miniature Statue of Liberty?


871
00:30:41.359 --> 00:30:42.901
-That's the one.
-That's really cool.


872
00:30:44.818 --> 00:30:48.068
Uh, are you still looking
for a buyer for the poem?


873
00:30:48.151 --> 00:30:49.401
I haven't found anyone yet.

874
00:30:49.484 --> 00:30:51.484
It dawned on me earlier

875
00:30:51.568 --> 00:30:52.943
that one of the investors
in Tesoro Mio


876
00:30:53.026 --> 00:30:54.317
is also a very big collector.

877
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:56.442
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.


878
00:30:56.526 --> 00:30:57.818
Do you think
he might be interested?


879
00:30:57.901 --> 00:31:00.110
Yeah, I mean, we can call him
and find out.


880
00:31:00.193 --> 00:31:01.276
Here, let me help you with that.

881
00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:02.818
Oh, thank you.

882
00:31:02.901 --> 00:31:04.526
You would be willing
to call him for me?


883
00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:06.068
Of course!

884
00:31:06.151 --> 00:31:08.026
To save a very important piece
of New York history?


885
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.151
I can't promise anything.

886
00:31:10.234 --> 00:31:11.651
No! I mean, of course not.

887
00:31:11.734 --> 00:31:12.901
I'm not expecting anything,

888
00:31:12.985 --> 00:31:14.317
but thank you.

889
00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:15.609
Also, if you need help
lugging stuff around,


890
00:31:15.693 --> 00:31:16.818
I've got an SUV.

891
00:31:16.901 --> 00:31:18.068
I could help you.

892
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.192
Ohh...

893
00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:28.484
Okay.

894
00:31:28.568 --> 00:31:30.859
Oh. What floor are we on?

895
00:31:30.943 --> 00:31:31.818
Uh, the top floor.

896
00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:33.734
I mean--

897
00:31:33.818 --> 00:31:35.026
There's an elevator!

898
00:31:36.776 --> 00:31:38.151
I wouldn't do that to you!

899
00:31:38.234 --> 00:31:39.901
You taught me to make cannolis
this morning.


900
00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:41.526
I thought
I was in for a workout.


901
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.026
Where do you want this thing?

902
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.317
Yeah.
Right here in the middle.


903
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.776
All right.

904
00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:48.609
Oh. Nice place.

905
00:31:48.693 --> 00:31:49.734
Thanks. I like it.

906
00:31:49.818 --> 00:31:51.985
All right. One, two, three--

907
00:31:53.985 --> 00:31:56.317
Perfect. Hey, can I get you
something to drink?


908
00:31:56.401 --> 00:31:58.192
Yeah, water would be great.

909
00:31:58.276 --> 00:31:59.192
Perfect.

910
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.276
Um... so are you
collecting rugs?


911
00:32:05.359 --> 00:32:07.234
No, Why?

912
00:32:07.317 --> 00:32:09.234
'Cause you got, like,

913
00:32:09.317 --> 00:32:10.818
That.

914
00:32:10.901 --> 00:32:12.943
Well...

915
00:32:13.026 --> 00:32:15.026
sometimes, you think
something's gonna work


916
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.401
and then it doesn't.

917
00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:18.568
Mm. You have to just move on.

918
00:32:18.651 --> 00:32:19.693
Are we still
talking about rugs?


919
00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:22.442
No.

920
00:32:22.526 --> 00:32:24.693
Now we're talking about my ex.

921
00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.901
Finn was going to move in
with me,


922
00:32:26.985 --> 00:32:30.484
and, um, so we started shopping
for stuff for my place,


923
00:32:30.568 --> 00:32:33.068
you know, for both of us,

924
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.651
and he picked out this rug...

925
00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:37.317
...and I gave in.

926
00:32:37.401 --> 00:32:38.651
Well, at least we know
you're willing to compromise.


927
00:32:38.734 --> 00:32:40.317
Right.

928
00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:42.943
Just not all the way to L.A.

929
00:32:43.026 --> 00:32:44.109
That's where he moved.

930
00:32:44.192 --> 00:32:45.943
Well, I don't
know you very well,


931
00:32:46.026 --> 00:32:47.150
but I can't really see you
breaking up with New York.


932
00:32:55.526 --> 00:32:57.776
Hey, this is great.
I love this artwork right here.


933
00:32:57.859 --> 00:32:59.068
That's from
my mom's art gallery.


934
00:32:59.150 --> 00:32:59.985
Your mom has an art gallery?

935
00:33:00.068 --> 00:33:01.818
Mm-hmm.

936
00:33:01.901 --> 00:33:04.568
I just so happen to be looking
for some artwork for Tesoro Mio.


937
00:33:04.651 --> 00:33:07.484
Unless she's charging
Warhol prices, and then...


938
00:33:07.568 --> 00:33:09.442
I know someone
who knows someone


939
00:33:09.526 --> 00:33:11.068
who might be able
to get you a deal.


940
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.359
Sounds interesting.
And cryptic.


941
00:33:14.693 --> 00:33:16.068
So what's the verdict?

942
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.901
Just doesn't work, does it?

943
00:33:17.985 --> 00:33:19.276
Bah!

944
00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:20.818
Two thumbs down!

945
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:22.234
How's it getting
back downstairs, though?


946
00:33:23.526 --> 00:33:24.401
Oh, good afternoon.

947
00:33:24.484 --> 00:33:25.651
Wait, didn't you get my text

948
00:33:25.734 --> 00:33:27.442
saying I wasn't coming in
until later?


949
00:33:27.526 --> 00:33:28.776
I did.

950
00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:31.026
What, were you just
up late working?


951
00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:33.609
Yeah. I was, um, you know,
just going over


952
00:33:33.693 --> 00:33:35.067
all the paperwork for the party,

953
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.109
making sure that the vendors
had their contracts


954
00:33:37.192 --> 00:33:38.276
and everything.

955
00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:39.442
Mm. Everything's set.
What--


956
00:33:39.526 --> 00:33:41.859
Is that the catalog?

957
00:33:41.943 --> 00:33:43.317
It is.
How does it look?


958
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:45.192
Terrific.
I noticed at that back


959
00:33:45.276 --> 00:33:47.401
that you put a thank-you
to Tesoro Mio there.


960
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.109
Of course I did.

961
00:33:49.192 --> 00:33:50.985
You know,
they're catering the party


962
00:33:51.067 --> 00:33:53.067
and they need
the publicity.


963
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:53.776
Wow.
That's awfully nice of you.


964
00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:55.150
I'm a nice person.

965
00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:57.901
Most of the time.

966
00:33:57.985 --> 00:33:59.609
I'm just making an observation.

967
00:33:59.693 --> 00:34:01.985
Sounds more like
an exaggeration, to me.


968
00:34:02.067 --> 00:34:03.484
Look, don't get me wrong.
I like Tuxedo.


969
00:34:03.568 --> 00:34:04.568
He's charming, he can cook,

970
00:34:04.651 --> 00:34:06.568
he can keep up with you.

971
00:34:06.651 --> 00:34:08.067
What does that even mean?
You keep up with me.


972
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.276
All I'm saying is

973
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.776
that Finn, you know,
he was nice...


974
00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:12.818
really talented,

975
00:34:12.901 --> 00:34:14.568
but he was always
a few steps behind you.


976
00:34:14.651 --> 00:34:16.734
You need somebody who's more
of a speed-walker...


977
00:34:16.818 --> 00:34:18.234
like Tuxedo.

978
00:34:18.317 --> 00:34:19.943
First of all,
Tuxedo is just--


979
00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:21.150
Nick--

980
00:34:21.234 --> 00:34:22.401
-"Nick."
- "Nick."


981
00:34:22.484 --> 00:34:24.442
-Nick.
-Nick...


982
00:34:24.526 --> 00:34:25.693
is just
a business acquaintance, okay?


983
00:34:25.776 --> 00:34:26.693
He's sor--

984
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:31.150
It's him.

985
00:34:31.234 --> 00:34:32.526
Well, he's probably just
calling about business stuff.


986
00:34:35.276 --> 00:34:36.568
Hello?

987
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:38.234
I've got good news.

988
00:34:38.317 --> 00:34:40.150
So my investor said
he's willing to meet with you.


989
00:34:40.234 --> 00:34:41.859
Really? Wow.

990
00:34:41.943 --> 00:34:42.901
Yeah, he's got a house
out on Long Island,


991
00:34:42.985 --> 00:34:43.943
out by the beach.

992
00:34:44.025 --> 00:34:45.109
He wanted us
to come by on Sunday.


993
00:34:45.192 --> 00:34:46.734
Sunday's perfect.

994
00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.192
Why don't I pick you up
around...


995
00:34:48.276 --> 00:34:49.693
tch, I don't know, nine?

996
00:34:49.776 --> 00:34:51.442
Nine. Okay. Great.

997
00:34:51.526 --> 00:34:52.901
Ah, thank you so much.

998
00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.484
These look great.

999
00:34:55.568 --> 00:34:57.442
Tuxedo found a potential buyer
for the poem.


1000
00:34:57.526 --> 00:34:59.317
Just a business acquaintance,
huh?


1001
00:34:59.401 --> 00:35:00.901
He's just a stand-up guy.

1002
00:35:00.984 --> 00:35:03.150
Nick. Nick is just
a stand-up guy--


1003
00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:05.276
Would you stop
getting ideas? Please.


1004
00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:07.526
No, no. No. I mean,
I can't help it, it's in my DNA.


1005
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:10.109
I'll try to have no ideas.

1006
00:35:10.192 --> 00:35:11.818
Oh, look-- me
not having any ideas


1007
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:13.526
about you and Tuxedo...

1008
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:15.359
walking down a beach.

1009
00:35:15.442 --> 00:35:16.776
I need my own office.

1010
00:35:16.859 --> 00:35:18.651
Seriously,
|-| can't live like this.


1011
00:35:18.734 --> 00:35:19.651
"Nick."

1012
00:35:21.317 --> 00:35:23.943
Whoa-- oh! Okay.

1013
00:35:28.067 --> 00:35:29.067
Oh!

1014
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.317
-Hello.
-Hey!


1015
00:35:30.401 --> 00:35:32.192
Just checking in on you.

1016
00:35:32.276 --> 00:35:33.818
Well, don't worry.

1017
00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:36.401
It's been three weeks
and I am still standing.


1018
00:35:36.484 --> 00:35:37.484
What are you doing?

1019
00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:40.609
Why do I see paint cans
behind you?


1020
00:35:40.693 --> 00:35:41.776
I'm making some changes,
you know?


1021
00:35:41.859 --> 00:35:43.276
Out with the old,
in with the new?


1022
00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:45.442
Maybe something blue?

1023
00:35:45.526 --> 00:35:46.901
Wait, you didn't get rid of
that cute little table


1024
00:35:46.984 --> 00:35:48.984
you bought on our Vermont
weekend, did you?


1025
00:35:49.067 --> 00:35:50.734
Wasn't it
right next to your couch?


1026
00:35:50.818 --> 00:35:52.317
Yes! You have a good memory.
It was right there.


1027
00:35:52.401 --> 00:35:54.693
But now I've put it
in the bedroom.


1028
00:35:54.776 --> 00:35:56.401
Looks like you're making
some changes, too.


1029
00:35:56.484 --> 00:35:59.484
Yes. I, uh...

1030
00:35:59.568 --> 00:36:01.317
I'm just getting
started on the packing.


1031
00:36:01.401 --> 00:36:03.734
Paolo and I are moving
to our new place soon.


1032
00:36:03.818 --> 00:36:05.984
Oh. Well, I can't wait
to see it.


1033
00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:07.526
-
-Is that what time it is?


1034
00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:10.025
I have to go, I'm so sorry,
but Nick is picking me up.


1035
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.942
We're gonna go meet Bruce.

1036
00:36:11.025 --> 00:36:12.276
Who's Nick?

1037
00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:13.526
I don't have time to explain!

1038
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:16.651
Okay. Coat... scarf.

1039
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:20.484
I just got off
the phone with Tracy--


1040
00:36:20.568 --> 00:36:21.693
How is she doing?

1041
00:36:21.776 --> 00:36:23.067
She's redecorating.

1042
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.776
Oh, no. Do you remember
her last break-up?


1043
00:36:26.859 --> 00:36:28.734
I know. I even saw paint cans
in her living room.


1044
00:36:28.818 --> 00:36:30.401
I just hope we can get there

1045
00:36:30.484 --> 00:36:32.109
before she paints her walls
a color she's gonna regret.


1046
00:36:32.192 --> 00:36:33.693
What's your schedule like
this week?


1047
00:36:45.025 --> 00:36:46.484
-Good morning.
-Hey, good morning.


1048
00:36:46.568 --> 00:36:48.025
So, slight change of plans.

1049
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:49.276
-Oh--
-No, no, no. Don't worry.


1050
00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:50.609
We're still gonna go meet Bruce,

1051
00:36:50.693 --> 00:36:52.359
we're just not
going to his house.


1052
00:36:52.442 --> 00:36:54.192
Oh, okay.
Well, that sounds fine, right?


1053
00:36:54.276 --> 00:36:56.067
-Yeah.
-Okay. Thank you.


1054
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.526
Oh, what's this?

1055
00:36:58.609 --> 00:37:00.359
Ah, it's a little surprise
for the road.


1056
00:37:00.442 --> 00:37:01.401
-Okay.
-Some cannolis...


1057
00:37:02.568 --> 00:37:04.192
Cannolis for breakfast?

1058
00:37:04.276 --> 00:37:06.317
I love it.

1059
00:37:10.818 --> 00:37:12.025
So just keep in mind,

1060
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:14.317
you'd only be paying
half the asking price.


1061
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:16.651
The museum
will match the other half.


1062
00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:17.734
They're looking forward

1063
00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:19.192
to displaying the poem
full-time.


1064
00:37:19.276 --> 00:37:20.693
Bruce.

1065
00:37:20.776 --> 00:37:23.317
These words meant so much
to so many immigrants,


1066
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:25.192
including my grandmother.

1067
00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:27.526
Well, I really admire
what you're trying to do,


1068
00:37:27.609 --> 00:37:29.776
but I collect to invest...

1069
00:37:29.858 --> 00:37:32.067
and I resell
when the market's right.


1070
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.776
Oh, come on, Bruce.

1071
00:37:33.858 --> 00:37:37.734
What about considering this
a charitable donation?


1072
00:37:37.817 --> 00:37:39.276
I've already exceeded
my donations for the year.


1073
00:37:40.734 --> 00:37:42.150
Look, I'm very sorry,
but I'm a businessman.


1074
00:37:42.234 --> 00:37:43.651
I'm not a philanthropist.

1075
00:37:43.734 --> 00:37:44.817
Of course.

1076
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.984
I'm sure
you'll find the right person.


1077
00:37:46.067 --> 00:37:47.734
You have someone in mind?

1078
00:37:47.817 --> 00:37:50.401
I don't, but you two
should definitely keep at it.


1079
00:37:50.484 --> 00:37:51.817
You're pretty good together.

1080
00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:57.484
I am interested

1081
00:37:57.568 --> 00:37:59.568
in this George Washington
letter, though,


1082
00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:01.984
so maybe your trip out here
wasn't for nothing.


1083
00:38:02.067 --> 00:38:05.359
Hey, I mean, we knew
it was a long shot, right?


1084
00:38:05.442 --> 00:38:07.234
Yeah, long shots are always
worth a try, though.


1085
00:38:07.317 --> 00:38:08.568
-I should know.
-Meaning?


1086
00:38:08.651 --> 00:38:09.693
Well, my grandmother thinks

1087
00:38:09.776 --> 00:38:11.192
my new restaurant
is a total long shot.


1088
00:38:11.276 --> 00:38:12.568
- What?
-Yeah.


1089
00:38:12.651 --> 00:38:13.775
Why?

1090
00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.276
Ah, she's old-school.

1091
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:17.526
She doesn't understand
the idea of anybody wanting


1092
00:38:17.609 --> 00:38:19.858
to blend Italian cooking
with any other kind of cuisine.


1093
00:38:19.942 --> 00:38:21.526
Well, come on,
"old-school" doesn't mean


1094
00:38:21.609 --> 00:38:23.234
that she might not
come around.


1095
00:38:23.317 --> 00:38:24.734
Yeah, right.

1096
00:38:24.817 --> 00:38:27.734
There's old-school,
then there's Italian old-school.


1097
00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:29.942
-Got it.
-Yeah.


1098
00:38:30.025 --> 00:38:32.109
Well, what made you decide
to go with fusion anyway?


1099
00:38:32.192 --> 00:38:33.609
Uh, ex-fiancée.

1100
00:38:33.693 --> 00:38:35.109
-"Ex"?
-Ex.


1101
00:38:35.192 --> 00:38:36.609
I've been there.

1102
00:38:36.693 --> 00:38:38.067
Yeah, we were together
four years.


1103
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.401
She's a chef also,
Asian cuisine.


1104
00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.858
And we decided to blend
our lives together,


1105
00:38:42.942 --> 00:38:45.401
uh, we also wanted to blend
our food passions together,


1106
00:38:45.484 --> 00:38:47.775
and boom-- "Tesoro Mio."

1107
00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:49.942
Well, it does sound delicious.

1108
00:38:50.025 --> 00:38:53.150
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1109
00:38:53.234 --> 00:38:55.775
But, uh, I'm moving on
with her blessing.


1110
00:38:55.858 --> 00:38:57.317
So things ended well?

1111
00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.651
Yeah. Yeah, especially for her.

1112
00:38:59.733 --> 00:39:01.858
She's now married
to a Brazilian chef,


1113
00:39:01.942 --> 00:39:03.900
and they have
two restaurants in Rio.


1114
00:39:03.984 --> 00:39:05.234
- Oh. Great.
-Mm-hmm.


1115
00:39:05.317 --> 00:39:07.150
And what about you?

1116
00:39:07.234 --> 00:39:10.150
Ah, taking a little...
a little break.


1117
00:39:10.234 --> 00:39:11.484
You know,
focusing on the new restaurant.


1118
00:39:11.568 --> 00:39:13.442
Mm-hmm.

1119
00:39:13.526 --> 00:39:15.025
You know, my best friend, Avery,
always says


1120
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:16.942
that everything happens
for a reason.


1121
00:39:17.025 --> 00:39:18.276
-Mm.
-I don't know.


1122
00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:19.568
Maybe I'm starting
to believe her.


1123
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.568
Speaking of--

1124
00:39:22.651 --> 00:39:24.150
Sorry things didn't work out
so well with Bruce.


1125
00:39:24.234 --> 00:39:26.150
You know what?
We gave it our best shot, right?


1126
00:39:26.234 --> 00:39:27.568
-That, we did.
-Yeah.


1127
00:39:29.276 --> 00:39:30.401
So, Trace,

1128
00:39:30.484 --> 00:39:31.942
what's the attire
for this party?


1129
00:39:32.025 --> 00:39:34.526
{Tracy] The usual-- upscale
New York cocktail party.


1130
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:36.109
Ah.

1131
00:39:36.192 --> 00:39:39.276
So, in other words,
a little black dress?


1132
00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:41.401
Or...

1133
00:39:41.484 --> 00:39:43.401
Whoa.

1134
00:39:43.484 --> 00:39:45.775
That is your dress.

1135
00:39:45.858 --> 00:39:47.025
I don't know.

1136
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:48.442
You think?

1137
00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:49.858
|-| don't know.

1138
00:39:49.942 --> 00:39:51.900
What about this one?
This one's sort of more...


1139
00:39:51.984 --> 00:39:53.317
I don't know.

1140
00:39:53.401 --> 00:39:56.858
This one's a little more...

1141
00:39:56.942 --> 00:39:59.942
Trace, I've never seen you

1142
00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:02.067
so in doubt
about a dress before,


1143
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.109
especially one that looks
like it was made for you.


1144
00:40:04.192 --> 00:40:05.359
What's going on?

1145
00:40:05.442 --> 00:40:06.733
Nothing!

1146
00:40:06.817 --> 00:40:08.733
It's 'cause I'm not sure
which one is right.


1147
00:40:08.817 --> 00:40:10.817
For what?

1148
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.067
Or should I say,
for who?


1149
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.775
Have you met someone?

1150
00:40:14.858 --> 00:40:16.317
Sort of.

1151
00:40:16.401 --> 00:40:17.609
But I don't know!
I mean, maybe it's something.


1152
00:40:17.692 --> 00:40:19.234
Or maybe it's nothing!

1153
00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:21.067
Or maybe I'm just not ready
to be in a relationship yet.


1154
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.609
You know?

1155
00:40:22.692 --> 00:40:24.150
Well, it's given you pause
about buying a new dress,


1156
00:40:24.234 --> 00:40:25.526
so maybe it is something.

1157
00:40:26.984 --> 00:40:30.150
Either way,
you have to buy that dress.


1158
00:40:30.234 --> 00:40:32.067
Thanks, Mom.

1159
00:40:33.984 --> 00:40:35.900
You want to grab
an early dinner after this?


1160
00:40:35.984 --> 00:40:37.359
Oh, Mom, I would love to,

1161
00:40:37.442 --> 00:40:39.442
but Avery and Emma
are coming into town tonight.


1162
00:40:39.526 --> 00:40:40.650
Ah, what's the occasion?

1163
00:40:40.733 --> 00:40:41.817
No occasion,

1164
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.733
they're just
being good friends.


1165
00:40:43.817 --> 00:40:44.984
Mm.

1166
00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:46.192
You know you guys
didn't have to come.


1167
00:40:46.276 --> 00:40:47.442
Yes, we did,

1168
00:40:47.526 --> 00:40:49.109
given the state
of your apartment.


1169
00:40:49.192 --> 00:40:53.025
I know how it seems,
but I'm fine, really.


1170
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:54.817
We were just
a little worried about you.


1171
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.650
Especially when
I saw all those paint cans--


1172
00:40:56.733 --> 00:40:58.401
It just reminded me of the time

1173
00:40:58.484 --> 00:41:00.150
you painted
your apartment purple, and--


1174
00:41:00.234 --> 00:41:02.317
Okay, okay. It was lilac!

1175
00:41:02.401 --> 00:41:04.317
-It was bad.
-It was


1176
00:41:04.401 --> 00:41:05.775
These paint cans have
a very pretty light green


1177
00:41:05.858 --> 00:41:06.817
-in them.
-Oh!


1178
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.858
I think it's gonna be great,

1179
00:41:07.942 --> 00:41:09.109
and since you're here,

1180
00:41:09.192 --> 00:41:11.192
maybe you two could
help me paint.


1181
00:41:11.276 --> 00:41:13.025
If that's what you want to do,
of course, we'll do that.


1182
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:14.775
-You are the sweetest.
-Avery!


1183
00:41:14.858 --> 00:41:16.317
But I love you.

1184
00:41:16.401 --> 00:41:18.484
You're the nicest person
I know, seriously.


1185
00:41:18.568 --> 00:41:20.608
Okay, where are
we going to dinner?


1186
00:41:20.692 --> 00:41:22.942
Oh, I discovered
this new Italian place,


1187
00:41:23.025 --> 00:41:24.234
and I thought we could,
you know, just check it out.


1188
00:41:24.317 --> 00:41:25.234
Okay.

1189
00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:28.442
Well, look who it is!

1190
00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:29.817
Oh, you're becoming a regular.

1191
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.817
These are my friends,
Emma and Avery.


1192
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.317
-Hi.
-Hi.


1193
00:41:33.401 --> 00:41:34.276
The other two-thirds
of the veil?


1194
00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:35.401
Nice to meet you.

1195
00:41:35.484 --> 00:41:36.900
Oh! You know about the veil?

1196
00:41:36.984 --> 00:41:38.317
Well, he was at Luigi's

1197
00:41:38.401 --> 00:41:39.984
when I had to take it in
to get repaired.


1198
00:41:40.067 --> 00:41:42.317
Oh. You didn't tell us that.

1199
00:41:42.401 --> 00:41:46.192
This is Nick
and he is a very talented chef.


1200
00:41:46.276 --> 00:41:47.692
Meh...

1201
00:41:47.775 --> 00:41:49.150
Is this the same Nick
who took you Long Island?


1202
00:41:49.234 --> 00:41:50.442
Well, unfortunately,

1203
00:41:50.526 --> 00:41:53.025
that turned out to be a bust,
but yes.


1204
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:56.192
But I did
get to see the Oheka Castle--


1205
00:41:56.276 --> 00:42:00.025
One of the architects
who also designed Central Park.


1206
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:01.775
I can't believe
you never know about that.


1207
00:42:01.858 --> 00:42:03.484
Tracy knows New York
better than I do.


1208
00:42:03.567 --> 00:42:05.484
But that is my favorite part
about the city,


1209
00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:06.817
that there's always something
new to discover.


1210
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.025
Always.

1211
00:42:13.775 --> 00:42:15.317
Oh!

1212
00:42:15.401 --> 00:42:16.608
Hey, thank you.

1213
00:42:16.692 --> 00:42:18.900
I hope you don't mind.
I took the liberty.


1214
00:42:18.984 --> 00:42:19.817
-Oh!
-She does not mind,


1215
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.526
and neither do we!
Thank you.


1216
00:42:22.817 --> 00:42:23.984
I could tell you the specials,

1217
00:42:24.067 --> 00:42:26.234
or you could just
put yourselves in my hands.


1218
00:42:26.317 --> 00:42:28.442
Oh, no, we-- we will
put ourselves in your hands.


1219
00:42:28.525 --> 00:42:29.900
Okay.

1220
00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:32.234
All right. Perfect.
I'll be right back.


1221
00:42:32.317 --> 00:42:33.317
I didn't mean it like that.

1222
00:42:33.401 --> 00:42:34.317
We didn't say anything.

1223
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.525
No. What do you--
What do you...


1224
00:42:35.608 --> 00:42:36.692
Nothing.

1225
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.359
Cheers.

1226
00:42:39.442 --> 00:42:40.442
I don't know what
you're talking about.


1227
00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:42.025
Aw, thank you.

1228
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:45.775
Scusami, cameriere.
Vorremmo ordinare il dessert.


1229
00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:50.067
What a find this place is.

1230
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.650
I mean, not to mention Nick.

1231
00:42:54.442 --> 00:42:56.234
What? I was talking
about his cooking.


1232
00:42:56.317 --> 00:42:57.858
Uh-huh.

1233
00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.359
I just ordered us
some dessert.


1234
00:42:59.442 --> 00:43:02.442
Yes. I noticed you were
practicing your Italian.


1235
00:43:02.525 --> 00:43:04.109
I was trying.
Every chance I get.


1236
00:43:04.192 --> 00:43:06.025
Paolo's trying to improve
his English,


1237
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:07.984
so we're not speaking Italian
too much at home right now.


1238
00:43:08.067 --> 00:43:09.359
So when are you
going back to Italy?


1239
00:43:09.442 --> 00:43:11.650
Probably the start
of spring semester?


1240
00:43:11.733 --> 00:43:13.025
It's just not official yet.

1241
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:14.608
And then you'll continue
tracing the veil?


1242
00:43:16.442 --> 00:43:17.650
-That's the plan. Yeah.
-Okay.


1243
00:43:17.733 --> 00:43:19.109
I'm still wondering
how it got to the States.


1244
00:43:19.192 --> 00:43:20.858
-And so am I.
-So is Avery.


1245
00:43:28.692 --> 00:43:29.401
Why do they think
it's my birthday!


1246
00:43:29.483 --> 00:43:31.067
Just smile and eat cake.

1247
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.192
I guess my Italian's
not as good as I thought!


1248
00:43:33.276 --> 00:43:34.317
It's okay, Em,
at least you know


1249
00:43:34.401 --> 00:43:35.359
how to order three forks.

1250
00:43:36.942 --> 00:43:38.858
Stop it. Thank you.

1251
00:43:42.234 --> 00:43:44.067
It's exactly what I ordered.
Thank you.


1252
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.359
This is amazing.

1253
00:43:45.442 --> 00:43:47.650
Let me cut that
into some smaller pieces.


1254
00:43:47.733 --> 00:43:48.567
-We'll take care of it.
-Thank you!


1255
00:43:50.608 --> 00:43:52.775
Thank you, Nick.
Everything was wonderful.


1256
00:43:52.858 --> 00:43:54.234
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1257
00:43:54.317 --> 00:43:57.608
So, if you find yourselves
in New York on the 30th,


1258
00:43:57.692 --> 00:43:59.608
I'm doing the grand opening
of our new restaurant,


1259
00:43:59.692 --> 00:44:01.025
and I would love
for you all to come.


1260
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:02.817
Oh, that's so nice of you.

1261
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.441
I think Tracy will probably have
to represent the three of us.


1262
00:44:05.525 --> 00:44:06.733
Well, I won't say no to that.

1263
00:44:06.817 --> 00:44:08.150
That's good to hear.

1264
00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:14.192
Okay, I should probably
get back to the kitchen.


1265
00:44:14.276 --> 00:44:16.234
Is there anything else
I can get for you ladies?


1266
00:44:16.317 --> 00:44:17.567
No, everything was perfect.

1267
00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.401
It really was.

1268
00:44:19.483 --> 00:44:21.525
All right. Wonderful.
Very nice to meet both of you.


1269
00:44:21.608 --> 00:44:23.483
You too.

1270
00:44:28.942 --> 00:44:30.234
What?

1271
00:44:30.317 --> 00:44:32.276
-Nothing.
-Nothing.


1272
00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:33.900
Stop looking at me like that.

1273
00:44:33.984 --> 00:44:34.900
The cheesecake's really good.

1274
00:44:34.984 --> 00:44:35.900
Really good.

1275
00:44:35.984 --> 00:44:37.234
It is good.

1276
00:44:44.733 --> 00:44:47.025
I just can't believe that Nick
wouldn't let us pay for dinner.


1277
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:48.942
He is quite a guy.

1278
00:44:49.025 --> 00:44:51.276
No! Do not go all Avery on me.

1279
00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:52.317
I'm just saying,

1280
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.650
it's obvious he likes you,

1281
00:44:53.733 --> 00:44:56.109
and from what I can tell,
he is a keeper.


1282
00:44:56.192 --> 00:44:57.733
-Definitely a keeper.
-Not you, too!


1283
00:44:57.817 --> 00:44:58.900
But you have to admit,
come on,


1284
00:44:58.984 --> 00:45:00.817
this is the veil
working its magic.


1285
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.900
Really?
Are we back to that?


1286
00:45:02.984 --> 00:45:04.942
Yes! But, Tracy, the veil
can only do so much.


1287
00:45:05.025 --> 00:45:06.359
You do have to meet it half-way.

1288
00:45:06.441 --> 00:45:09.276
I am not asking the veil
to do anything.


1289
00:45:09.358 --> 00:45:11.025
I think what we're saying is,

1290
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:13.858
you just really need to think
about what it is that you want.


1291
00:45:13.942 --> 00:45:15.067
You know, actually,
what I want right now


1292
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.900
is some space.

1293
00:45:17.234 --> 00:45:20.317
So I'm-- I'm just
gonna say goodnight.


1294
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.817
Tracy, I didn't--

1295
00:45:24.984 --> 00:45:26.276
Wow.

1296
00:45:26.358 --> 00:45:27.234
She's really good
with that whistle.


1297
00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.567
I think
it's a New York thing.


1298
00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:35.025
Hi.

1299
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:36.817
Wow. This is great.

1300
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.234
-Welcome.
-Thank you.


1301
00:45:38.317 --> 00:45:39.692
You know,
I am a native New Yorker,


1302
00:45:39.775 --> 00:45:40.775
and this is the first time

1303
00:45:40.858 --> 00:45:42.234
I've ever been
to an auction house.


1304
00:45:42.317 --> 00:45:45.109
No, actually,
I can't even imagine that.


1305
00:45:45.192 --> 00:45:46.276
Can I show you around a little?

1306
00:45:46.358 --> 00:45:48.358
-Absolutely.
-Okay.


1307
00:45:48.441 --> 00:45:50.192
So how'd you get into
all this?


1308
00:45:50.276 --> 00:45:53.150
I always loved history,
ever since I was little.


1309
00:45:53.234 --> 00:45:55.400
I didn't even want to go
to summer camp,


1310
00:45:55.483 --> 00:45:58.984
I just wanted to visit every
historical site in the city.


1311
00:45:59.067 --> 00:46:02.234
That sounds so nerdy
when I say it out loud.


1312
00:46:02.316 --> 00:46:05.316
Not at all.
Bet you give one heck of a tour.


1313
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.192
Oh, yeah. All the way
from the Bronx to the Bowery.


1314
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.650
So, what do you think?

1315
00:46:12.733 --> 00:46:14.984
Well, I mean, it's a lot,

1316
00:46:15.067 --> 00:46:16.358
and I think it would be

1317
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.900
a great place
to come and work every day.


1318
00:46:17.984 --> 00:46:19.234
You know, you've got

1319
00:46:19.316 --> 00:46:22.775
all of this amazing history
coming through.


1320
00:46:22.858 --> 00:46:24.608
Oh, there's just
so much history


1321
00:46:24.692 --> 00:46:25.900
and beautiful art,

1322
00:46:25.984 --> 00:46:27.525
and amazing jewelry.

1323
00:46:27.608 --> 00:46:28.942
It...

1324
00:46:29.025 --> 00:46:30.817
It's everything.

1325
00:46:34.067 --> 00:46:36.400
But you're here to see
the kitchen, aren't you?


1326
00:46:36.483 --> 00:46:37.525
-Uh, yeah.
-I'll show you


1327
00:46:37.608 --> 00:46:39.150
where you're gonna set up.

1328
00:46:40.608 --> 00:46:42.733
So I think you have
everything we need here,


1329
00:46:42.817 --> 00:46:43.817
except for a couple things,

1330
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.109
which I can bring
from the restaurant.


1331
00:46:45.192 --> 00:46:46.733
-Yeah, and I'll make a list.
-Perfect.


1332
00:46:46.817 --> 00:46:49.275
Um... and I gotta tell you,

1333
00:46:49.358 --> 00:46:51.316
seeing all
this fantastic art here


1334
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.900
has reminded me

1335
00:46:52.984 --> 00:46:55.900
that I need to fill up the walls
at my new restaurant.


1336
00:46:55.984 --> 00:46:58.358
So if your offer to go see
your mom's gallery


1337
00:46:58.441 --> 00:46:59.400
is still on the table...

1338
00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:00.858
Absolutely.

1339
00:47:00.942 --> 00:47:02.483
Professionally speaking,

1340
00:47:02.567 --> 00:47:05.358
I should probably
see your new restaurant first.


1341
00:47:05.441 --> 00:47:07.608
Hmm. Yeah, you might be
on to something there.


1342
00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:09.858
Yeah.

1343
00:47:09.942 --> 00:47:12.109
Why don't you come by
today after work?


1344
00:47:12.192 --> 00:47:13.942
Sure. Sure. I'm free.
I would love to.


1345
00:47:14.025 --> 00:47:15.192
Okay.

1346
00:47:15.275 --> 00:47:16.733
-See you there.
-Okay.


1347
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.650
Wow. This is a great space.

1348
00:47:21.733 --> 00:47:23.817
So have you thought about
what kind of art?


1349
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.067
Well, I like paintings.

1350
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.150
Right. That's a little vague.

1351
00:47:28.233 --> 00:47:30.358
I like paintings of landscapes,
you know?


1352
00:47:30.441 --> 00:47:32.400
And when you look at them,
you kind of want to go there,


1353
00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:33.942
type of landscapes.

1354
00:47:34.025 --> 00:47:36.233
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.


1355
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.192
Okay, well, any other thoughts?

1356
00:47:39.275 --> 00:47:40.733
No.

1357
00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:43.441
Just nothing that makes you
lose your appetite.


1358
00:47:43.525 --> 00:47:46.025
Right! Good call.

1359
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:48.608
Uh, you know,
art is subjective, right?


1360
00:47:48.692 --> 00:47:51.067
I get that, and that's
really why I need your help.


1361
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.525
Like, I am very confident
with my calamari,


1362
00:47:54.608 --> 00:47:57.567
but I have no idea what to put
on the walls, you know?


1363
00:47:58.984 --> 00:48:00.441
Have you thought about
fine art photography?


1364
00:48:00.525 --> 00:48:01.942
Yes, and that is a great idea,

1365
00:48:02.025 --> 00:48:03.567
but if I put
a photo on these walls


1366
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.191
that is not of my family,

1367
00:48:05.275 --> 00:48:07.358
my grandmother, she is never
gonna let me live it down.


1368
00:48:07.441 --> 00:48:09.025
Well, I don't know
if I can help you with that,


1369
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:10.191
-but--
-


1370
00:48:10.275 --> 00:48:13.025
Oh, um, that was just Luigi
texting me


1371
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:14.650
to remind me that I need
to pick up the veil.


1372
00:48:14.733 --> 00:48:16.233
I thought
you picked that up already?


1373
00:48:16.316 --> 00:48:18.109
No. No, I haven't
had a chance yet.


1374
00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:19.400
It's no rush.

1375
00:48:19.483 --> 00:48:21.650
I thought
your friends needed it?


1376
00:48:21.733 --> 00:48:24.567
They-- no. They, uh,
are already married.


1377
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.109
In fact, they both wore the veil
at their weddings.


1378
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.817
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.


1379
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.567
Hmm. So that means you're
the only one of your friends


1380
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:31.817
that's still single?

1381
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.942
Yep, but I'm not
complaining about it.


1382
00:48:35.025 --> 00:48:36.316
No, I totally get it.

1383
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.692
I'm not complaining about being

1384
00:48:37.775 --> 00:48:39.650
the only one of my friends
who's still single,


1385
00:48:39.733 --> 00:48:42.191
but if you ask my nonna
and my mother...


1386
00:48:42.275 --> 00:48:43.984
ooh!

1387
00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:45.733
I think I should
just pick up the veil


1388
00:48:45.817 --> 00:48:47.400
and stop making a thing
out of it, you know?


1389
00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.900
Hey, Avery,
can you hold on a second,


1390
00:48:52.984 --> 00:48:53.984
so I can get Emma on, too?

1391
00:48:54.067 --> 00:48:55.191
Great.

1392
00:48:59.775 --> 00:49:02.233
Okay, now that you're both
here, I, urn...


1393
00:49:02.316 --> 00:49:03.942
I want to apologize.

1394
00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:05.858
We're sorry, too.

1395
00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:08.567
Yeah, we realized we came on
a little strong about Nick.


1396
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.275
And the veil.

1397
00:49:10.358 --> 00:49:11.900
We just want you
to find the right person.


1398
00:49:11.984 --> 00:49:13.817
Whoever it is.

1399
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.149
Ohh! I can't stand it
when we fight.


1400
00:49:16.233 --> 00:49:18.149
Wait a second. I don't
remember us ever being


1401
00:49:18.233 --> 00:49:20.067
in a big blow-out fight before.

1402
00:49:20.149 --> 00:49:21.858
That's not true.

1403
00:49:21.942 --> 00:49:22.984
Remember when we were
studying for finals


1404
00:49:23.067 --> 00:49:25.149
and we accused the others

1405
00:49:25.233 --> 00:49:26.567
of eating the last
chocolate-chip cookie?


1406
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.108
Yeah, that's 'cause you did.

1407
00:49:28.191 --> 00:49:30.525
-
-I totally forgot about that.


1408
00:49:30.608 --> 00:49:32.817
In our defense,
we were super-sleep-deprived.


1409
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.025
I was so tired!

1410
00:49:35.775 --> 00:49:38.650
So... are we good?

1411
00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:40.358
Aw, you don't even have to ask.

1412
00:49:40.441 --> 00:49:41.858
'Course we're good.

1413
00:49:41.942 --> 00:49:43.608
I love you, girls.

1414
00:49:43.692 --> 00:49:47.525
All right. Avery, you first.
Tell me about your day.


1415
00:49:52.067 --> 00:49:54.358
Oh, that's interesting.

1416
00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:56.608
It's a bit intense.

1417
00:49:56.692 --> 00:49:57.942
Well, clearly,

1418
00:49:58.025 --> 00:49:59.525
you haven't tried
my spicy ramen arrabbiata.


1419
00:50:01.025 --> 00:50:02.900
Oh, I love that.

1420
00:50:04.316 --> 00:50:05.858
For the restaurant?

1421
00:50:05.942 --> 00:50:07.817
No. It's for my apartment.

1422
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.525
It's gonna go perfect
with my new rug.


1423
00:50:09.608 --> 00:50:11.108
Which one?

1424
00:50:11.191 --> 00:50:12.316
As I recall, you have quite
the collection going on.


1425
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.483
I'll narrow it down, okay?

1426
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.650
Find anything you like?

1427
00:50:18.733 --> 00:50:21.025
Uh, I don't think so. Sorry.

1428
00:50:21.108 --> 00:50:22.358
Oh, don't be sorry.

1429
00:50:22.441 --> 00:50:23.567
I've got some new pieces
coming in a few days...


1430
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:24.942
Hmm.

1431
00:50:25.025 --> 00:50:26.108
...If you'd like to come back.

1432
00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:27.567
Well, let me check
with my designer.


1433
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:29.942
Would you like to come back
in a couple days?


1434
00:50:30.025 --> 00:50:31.984
I think we can make that work.

1435
00:50:32.066 --> 00:50:34.066
You don't mind
being stuck with me again?


1436
00:50:34.149 --> 00:50:36.525
You're not so bad
to be stuck with.


1437
00:50:36.608 --> 00:50:38.149
Did you hear that?

1438
00:50:47.316 --> 00:50:49.567
May I have a moment?

1439
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:50.650
Yes. Yes, of course, Leland.

1440
00:50:52.692 --> 00:50:55.441
Tracy, I know how hard
you've worked on the party,


1441
00:50:55.525 --> 00:50:56.984
and I just wanted to say
thank you


1442
00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:58.900
for making it so special.

1443
00:50:58.984 --> 00:51:00.858
Well, I am honored.

1444
00:51:00.942 --> 00:51:03.984
I mean, Metropolitan is like
a second home to me,


1445
00:51:04.066 --> 00:51:06.984
so I really wanted this party
to be perfect.


1446
00:51:07.066 --> 00:51:08.692
Well, the place wouldn't
be the same without you.


1447
00:51:08.775 --> 00:51:09.608
Am I going somewhere?

1448
00:51:09.692 --> 00:51:10.608
Not if I can help it.

1449
00:51:10.692 --> 00:51:11.984
Are you going somewhere?

1450
00:51:12.066 --> 00:51:14.650
Well, I have to retire,
eventually,


1451
00:51:14.733 --> 00:51:17.567
and I was hoping I could
leave it in capable hands.


1452
00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.066
Maybe those hands
might be yours.


1453
00:51:20.692 --> 00:51:22.733
Shall we go over
and join our guests?


1454
00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:29.817
Good news, bad news?

1455
00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.400
Good news.

1456
00:51:31.483 --> 00:51:33.358
The good news is you look
fantastic. Love the dress.


1457
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:34.900
Thank you.

1458
00:51:34.983 --> 00:51:36.817
There's no bad news.

1459
00:51:42.858 --> 00:51:45.191
Hey, are you okay handling
things on your own for a while?


1460
00:51:47.066 --> 00:51:49.733
Yeah, take as long as you want.

1461
00:51:49.817 --> 00:51:50.817
What?

1462
00:51:53.775 --> 00:51:55.983
You got your eyes on something
a little special over here?


1463
00:51:56.066 --> 00:51:58.358
Oh, uh, I'm just
appreciating the earrings.


1464
00:51:58.441 --> 00:51:59.817
Which? These, uh,
blue ones right here?


1465
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.608
Mm-hmm. They're sapphires.

1466
00:52:01.692 --> 00:52:02.817
There's just
something about them.


1467
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.692
Wow. Those are beautiful.

1468
00:52:05.775 --> 00:52:07.191
Have you heard the big buzz
of the party?


1469
00:52:07.275 --> 00:52:08.441
-No.
-Everyone's raving


1470
00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:09.608
about your food.

1471
00:52:09.692 --> 00:52:10.983
-What? Wow!
-Mm-hmm.


1472
00:52:11.066 --> 00:52:13.358
Wow. That is, uh,
that is music to my ears.


1473
00:52:13.441 --> 00:52:15.400
Well, I have to thank you,

1474
00:52:15.483 --> 00:52:17.733
because this party
is really important to me.


1475
00:52:17.817 --> 00:52:19.692
Of course. Of course.

1476
00:52:19.775 --> 00:52:23.108
And it was a pleasure
to, you know, watch you


1477
00:52:23.191 --> 00:52:24.733
and kind of get a glimpse
into your world.


1478
00:52:24.817 --> 00:52:26.149
So thank you.

1479
00:52:26.233 --> 00:52:28.066
Have you had a chance
to see the Lazarus poem?


1480
00:52:28.149 --> 00:52:29.066
No, I haven't.

1481
00:52:29.149 --> 00:52:30.066
Can you come see it now?

1482
00:52:30.149 --> 00:52:30.983
Are you kidding me?
Absolutely.


1483
00:52:31.066 --> 00:52:31.817
-Okay.
-Yeah.


1484
00:52:34.316 --> 00:52:37.358
Wow. Look at that.
That is special.


1485
00:52:37.441 --> 00:52:38.692
Yeah.

1486
00:52:38.775 --> 00:52:40.483
To see this poem
in her actual handwriting?


1487
00:52:40.567 --> 00:52:42.400
-I know.
-Wow.


1488
00:52:42.483 --> 00:52:44.233
Now I understand why
you've been fighting so hard.


1489
00:52:44.316 --> 00:52:45.608
And mostly failing.

1490
00:52:45.692 --> 00:52:47.149
But that's okay.
I am not giving up.


1491
00:52:47.233 --> 00:52:48.400
I am not throwing in the towel.

1492
00:52:53.483 --> 00:52:54.441
Who is that guy?

1493
00:52:54.525 --> 00:52:55.941
Carter Wainwright.

1494
00:52:56.024 --> 00:52:57.483
He has a vast collection

1495
00:52:57.567 --> 00:52:59.983
of incredibly important
historical artifacts


1496
00:53:00.066 --> 00:53:01.191
and he keeps them all
locked in a vault.


1497
00:53:03.858 --> 00:53:05.775
I hate the idea
of a guy like that


1498
00:53:05.858 --> 00:53:07.191
getting his hands
on the poem.


1499
00:53:07.275 --> 00:53:08.858
It deserves to be seen

1500
00:53:08.941 --> 00:53:10.400
by the immigrants
that it was written for.


1501
00:53:11.692 --> 00:53:13.817
Nick! That's it.

1502
00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:16.149
You just gave me
a great idea.


1503
00:53:17.191 --> 00:53:18.483
So, remember,

1504
00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:19.983
in our conversation
at the party, you said,


1505
00:53:20.066 --> 00:53:22.817
how much that poem meant
to immigrants, right?


1506
00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:24.191
-Yeah.
-I should find someone


1507
00:53:24.275 --> 00:53:25.525
who it means something to,

1508
00:53:25.608 --> 00:53:28.066
you know,
someone who lived it.


1509
00:53:28.149 --> 00:53:30.733
Yeah, someone who emigrated
to the U.S. themselves.


1510
00:53:30.817 --> 00:53:32.275
Yes! Exactly.

1511
00:53:32.358 --> 00:53:34.358
So I researched
all day and all night


1512
00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:36.899
and I finally found
the perfect person.


1513
00:53:36.983 --> 00:53:38.233
Rangan Narula.

1514
00:53:38.316 --> 00:53:39.275
The tech guy?

1515
00:53:39.358 --> 00:53:41.316
Exactly. He came from nothing

1516
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.316
and he went the distance.

1517
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.899
Yeah, I'm not doing that again.

1518
00:53:45.983 --> 00:53:48.692
He is an incredibly inspiring
rags-to-riches story.


1519
00:53:48.775 --> 00:53:51.149
And he lives in Manhattan.

1520
00:53:51.233 --> 00:53:52.857
No way.
So, you called him?


1521
00:53:52.941 --> 00:53:54.857
Well, it's Sunday,
so his office is closed.


1522
00:53:54.941 --> 00:53:57.567
I emailed him
and all five of his assistants.


1523
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:58.483
Well, there you go.

1524
00:54:02.733 --> 00:54:04.525
Thank you.

1525
00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.483
This is it. This is the one.

1526
00:54:11.567 --> 00:54:13.191
You sure?

1527
00:54:13.275 --> 00:54:16.024
Yes, I am sure, it's perfect.
It fits right in.


1528
00:54:16.108 --> 00:54:17.608
Well, I guess you do
have to try a few out


1529
00:54:17.692 --> 00:54:19.775
before you find
the right one.


1530
00:54:19.857 --> 00:54:21.941
Are you still talking
about rugs?


1531
00:54:22.024 --> 00:54:23.692
Ahh... maybe.

1532
00:54:23.775 --> 00:54:25.024
Maybe not.

1533
00:54:25.108 --> 00:54:26.358
'Kay, well, I'm still
talking about rugs,


1534
00:54:26.441 --> 00:54:28.483
so don't confuse me.

1535
00:54:28.567 --> 00:54:30.149
Well, I guess
you'll figure it out.


1536
00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:31.899
Eventually.

1537
00:54:33.275 --> 00:54:35.275
-What?
-Nothing.


1538
00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:38.941
Morning, sunshine.
What's going on?


1539
00:54:39.024 --> 00:54:40.692
-Why don't you tell me?
-What?


1540
00:54:40.775 --> 00:54:42.733
You got a call
from Rangan Narula's office.


1541
00:54:42.816 --> 00:54:44.650
What's that all about?

1542
00:55:00.483 --> 00:55:01.733
Ms. Goodwyn?

1543
00:55:01.816 --> 00:55:04.108
Oh, yes. Hi.

1544
00:55:04.191 --> 00:55:05.774
-I'm ready.
-I am so sorry.


1545
00:55:05.857 --> 00:55:07.816
Mr. Narula has to reschedule
his appointment with you.


1546
00:55:07.899 --> 00:55:09.233
He was called away
on urgent business.


1547
00:55:09.316 --> 00:55:10.899
Perhaps next month sometime?

1548
00:55:10.983 --> 00:55:12.857
No. Next month is too late.

1549
00:55:12.941 --> 00:55:15.525
Apologies.

1550
00:55:24.608 --> 00:55:25.692
Hi.

1551
00:55:25.774 --> 00:55:26.816
How did it go with Narula?

1552
00:55:26.899 --> 00:55:27.774
Oh...

1553
00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.692
he had to go out of town

1554
00:55:29.774 --> 00:55:31.108
and he's not gonna be able
to reschedule the meeting


1555
00:55:31.191 --> 00:55:32.525
until after the auction.

1556
00:55:32.608 --> 00:55:34.774
Oh, that's a bummer.
I'm sorry.


1557
00:55:34.857 --> 00:55:37.316
But hey, you pushed to get
one meeting with him.


1558
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.608
Chances are,
you push to get another one,


1559
00:55:38.692 --> 00:55:39.983
you can get one
before the auction.


1560
00:55:40.066 --> 00:55:41.441
Yeah, I guess.
It's just that


1561
00:55:41.525 --> 00:55:44.441
Pushy Tracy is a little tired
from being so pushy.


1562
00:55:44.525 --> 00:55:45.774
Sounds like you need
a little cheering up,


1563
00:55:45.857 --> 00:55:47.316
and I could use a break.

1564
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.358
I guess I just thought
you never slowed down.


1565
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:52.149
Juggling two restaurants,
even temporarily,


1566
00:55:52.233 --> 00:55:54.066
is a lot more difficult
than I thought.


1567
00:55:55.525 --> 00:55:56.567
So this is
a no-work night, then.


1568
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:57.774
Mm-hmm.

1569
00:55:57.857 --> 00:55:59.233
No talking about food
or auctions.


1570
00:55:59.316 --> 00:56:00.899
Those are some strict rules.

1571
00:56:00.983 --> 00:56:03.024
I guess we're gonna find out
if our jobs define us.


1572
00:56:03.108 --> 00:56:05.816
Yeah, we could talk about
how your re-decorating is going,


1573
00:56:05.899 --> 00:56:07.525
or your rug-collecting.

1574
00:56:09.108 --> 00:56:12.233
Okay, that whole situation
is winding down, okay?


1575
00:56:12.316 --> 00:56:14.400
But we have to figure out
another subject to discuss.


1576
00:56:14.483 --> 00:56:15.941
Oh, I know.

1577
00:56:16.024 --> 00:56:18.191
How about places in New York
that we haven't visited?


1578
00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:20.233
In fact, I'll bet
you've never been to see


1579
00:56:20.316 --> 00:56:22.233
the last remaining piece
of the Ziegfeld Theatre.


1580
00:56:23.691 --> 00:56:25.441
What?
Where has that been hiding?


1581
00:56:25.525 --> 00:56:27.483
That's a secret.
I'm not tellin' you.


1582
00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:28.567
-What?
-I'll show it to you, though.


1583
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:29.774
-If you want to go.
-Okay.


1584
00:56:29.857 --> 00:56:31.732
Or... we could get
another piece of pizza.


1585
00:56:31.816 --> 00:56:33.691
Ooh... uh--

1586
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.024
I don't know.
This is really good pizza.


1587
00:56:37.108 --> 00:56:38.567
-Mm-hmm.
-But...


1588
00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:39.608
I want to go see the theater.

1589
00:56:39.691 --> 00:56:40.732
Aww...

1590
00:56:40.816 --> 00:56:41.857
All right, fine.

1591
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.441
Okay, so, I think we ended
in a tie, right?


1592
00:56:46.525 --> 00:56:49.108
Because we both stuck
to the rules the whole time.


1593
00:56:49.191 --> 00:56:51.066
But you almost blew it

1594
00:56:51.149 --> 00:56:53.108
when you first saw
that Ziegfeld statue.


1595
00:56:53.191 --> 00:56:54.358
You weren't supposed
to notice that?


1596
00:56:54.441 --> 00:56:56.358
-I notice everything.
-Well, I can't help it!


1597
00:56:56.441 --> 00:56:58.191
Ohh, now that it's over,
I have to tell you,


1598
00:56:58.275 --> 00:57:00.275
ooh, that statue would kill
at auction.


1599
00:57:00.358 --> 00:57:01.691
Should we go back and get it?

1600
00:57:07.774 --> 00:57:10.024
Thank you so much
for such a nice evening.


1601
00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:10.899
I had a great time.

1602
00:57:10.983 --> 00:57:12.649
Yeah, me too.

1603
00:57:12.732 --> 00:57:15.441
Let me know if you need
any more rugs carried up.


1604
00:57:15.525 --> 00:57:18.108
No, I think I'm good,
'cause that one's a keeper.


1605
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:19.400
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
We'll see about that.


1606
00:57:20.941 --> 00:57:22.024
Goodnight.

1607
00:57:22.108 --> 00:57:23.691
Goodnight!

1608
00:57:37.358 --> 00:57:39.525
Hey! How are you?

1609
00:57:39.607 --> 00:57:40.774
I think I'm in love.

1610
00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:43.275
Tracy! That's wonderful.

1611
00:57:43.358 --> 00:57:44.816
It's the perfect fit.

1612
00:57:44.899 --> 00:57:46.774
That's so hard to find.

1613
00:57:46.857 --> 00:57:48.816
Tell me about it.
I searched high and low.


1614
00:57:48.899 --> 00:57:50.483
That's what it takes sometimes.

1615
00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:52.108
I'm just so glad
the search is over...


1616
00:57:52.191 --> 00:57:54.567
and that I got
such a bargain.


1617
00:57:54.649 --> 00:57:55.774
Nick?

1618
00:57:55.857 --> 00:57:57.816
No, I'm talking about
my new rug.


1619
00:57:57.899 --> 00:57:59.233
I thought
we were talking about Nick.


1620
00:57:59.316 --> 00:58:00.732
You can't ask me to choose

1621
00:58:00.816 --> 00:58:01.649
between Nick
and my new rug.


1622
00:58:01.732 --> 00:58:02.774
Okay-

1623
00:58:02.857 --> 00:58:04.732
What about you and Nick?

1624
00:58:04.816 --> 00:58:06.316
I haven't decided
about that yet.


1625
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.857
You're interested, right?

1626
00:58:07.941 --> 00:58:09.149
Yes.

1627
00:58:09.233 --> 00:58:10.525
That's something.

1628
00:58:10.607 --> 00:58:12.316
-I'm just not sure what yet--
-


1629
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.732
Oh, I have to get
back to the office.


1630
00:58:13.816 --> 00:58:14.857
All right.

1631
00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:15.732
I'll talk to you soon.

1632
00:58:15.816 --> 00:58:17.691
Love you.

1633
00:58:17.774 --> 00:58:19.108
She's in love with her rug?

1634
00:58:19.191 --> 00:58:20.275
Yeah.

1635
00:58:20.358 --> 00:58:21.566
But your instincts were right.

1636
00:58:21.649 --> 00:58:23.774
She's been spending
more time with Nick.


1637
00:58:23.857 --> 00:58:25.649
That's the veil
working its magic.


1638
00:58:25.732 --> 00:58:27.275
I wouldn't mention that
to Tracy.


1639
00:58:27.358 --> 00:58:28.983
Oh, right, no. 
Of course not.

1640
00:58:29.066 --> 00:58:30.316
But I'm just telling you,

1641
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.233
I cannot wait to see her
in that wedding veil.


1642
00:58:32.316 --> 00:58:34.316
I know, but I wouldn't
mention that, either.


1643
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.816
'Course not. Okay, bye.

1644
00:58:37.774 --> 00:58:39.941
That is definitely a piece
of Broadway history.


1645
00:58:40.024 --> 00:58:42.483
I'll have to check out
this Ziegfeld statue for myself.


1646
00:58:42.566 --> 00:58:43.607
I have other photos.
You can scroll back.


1647
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:44.983
Okay
- Oh, yeah!

1648
00:58:45.066 --> 00:58:46.066
Oh--

1649
00:58:46.149 --> 00:58:47.358
That's from Avery's wedding.

1650
00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:48.983
Oh! That's a cute picture.

1651
00:58:49.066 --> 00:58:51.066
We took that in the gallery
at the Stan bridge Museum.


1652
00:58:51.149 --> 00:58:52.024
Oh, this infamous painting--

1653
00:58:52.108 --> 00:58:53.066
-
-Oh...


1654
00:58:53.149 --> 00:58:55.191
Tuxedo texting.

1655
00:58:55.275 --> 00:58:56.607
-Let me text him back. Uh...
-No. No, no, no, no!


1656
00:58:56.691 --> 00:58:57.566
Do not text him.
Give it to me!


1657
00:58:57.649 --> 00:58:58.774
No...

1658
00:58:58.857 --> 00:59:00.275
Oh, he's just
asking me to lunch.


1659
00:59:00.358 --> 00:59:01.483
Oh, that's fun.
Where will you go?


1660
00:59:01.566 --> 00:59:03.941
I don't know.
I'm gonna let him decide.


1661
00:59:04.024 --> 00:59:05.566
-I'll just...
-Okay, yeah.


1662
00:59:05.649 --> 00:59:08.066
That's cool. See. Uh...
"I raise you, your move." Yeah?


1663
00:59:08.149 --> 00:59:09.149
What about...

1664
00:59:09.233 --> 00:59:10.607
Well, go somewhere new.

1665
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:12.524
Okay. Okay, okay. Yeah.
That's what he wrote back!


1666
00:59:12.607 --> 00:59:13.607
-He said "somewhere new"?
-Yes.


1667
00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:15.066
Pickin' up
what you're puttin' down!


1668
00:59:15.149 --> 00:59:16.233
-Wow.
-Let's go.


1669
00:59:16.316 --> 00:59:17.316
You two are in sync.

1670
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.649
So we do this every month.

1671
00:59:18.732 --> 00:59:19.899
It was my nonna's idea.

1672
00:59:19.983 --> 00:59:22.233
She loves giving back, so...

1673
00:59:22.316 --> 00:59:25.149
Oh. I like her even more.

1674
00:59:25.233 --> 00:59:27.649
Welcome to our little
family tradition.


1675
00:59:27.732 --> 00:59:29.400
This is awesome. I would love
to help out, if I can.


1676
00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:30.358
You don't have to.

1677
00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:32.857
I want to.

1678
00:59:32.941 --> 00:59:34.275
You know, I bussed tables
when I was in college.


1679
00:59:34.358 --> 00:59:35.316
I can get four plates
on one arm.


1680
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.400
Wow, that's a lot of plates.

1681
00:59:36.483 --> 00:59:38.149
-
-Mama.


1682
00:59:38.233 --> 00:59:39.649
Sorry to interrupt.
This is Isabella.


1683
00:59:39.732 --> 00:59:41.483
-Tracy.

1684
00:59:41.566 --> 00:59:43.191
It's a pleasure
to meet you, honey.


1685
00:59:43.275 --> 00:59:44.108
It's really nice
to meet you, too.


1686
00:59:44.191 --> 00:59:45.233
This is my nonna, Gia.

1687
00:59:45.316 --> 00:59:46.983
Oh, I've heard
so much about you.


1688
00:59:47.066 --> 00:59:48.316
And I've heard about you.

1689
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.149
Nick says

1690
00:59:50.233 --> 00:59:53.400
you're trying to put the poem
Emma Lazarus wrote in a museum


1691
00:59:53.482 --> 00:59:54.649
for everyone to see.

1692
00:59:54.732 --> 00:59:56.441
Well, I am hoping
to make that happen.


1693
00:59:56.524 --> 00:59:57.857
And Tracy wants to help out,

1694
00:59:57.941 --> 00:59:58.732
she wants to help serve.

1695
00:59:58.816 --> 01:00:00.607
I'll get you an apron!

1696
01:00:00.691 --> 01:00:01.732
Oh, thank you.

1697
01:00:01.816 --> 01:00:03.233
-Oh--
-Don't make me laugh.


1698
01:00:03.316 --> 01:00:04.566
You can use your other hand!

1699
01:00:04.649 --> 01:00:06.108
-No, no. It's a point of pride.
-A|| right.


1700
01:00:06.191 --> 01:00:07.691
Don't.
Don't say anything.


1701
01:00:07.774 --> 01:00:09.732
She's not Italian.

1702
01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.316
Here I come. Okay.

1703
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.607
That's for you.

1704
01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:15.983
And that's for you, sir.

1705
01:00:16.066 --> 01:00:18.066
Yeah, but, Ma,
she seems to really like


1706
01:00:18.149 --> 01:00:21.233
one particular Italian
we both love, so...


1707
01:00:21.316 --> 01:00:23.649
Nice! Whoo!

1708
01:00:24.857 --> 01:00:26.275
Thank you.
Best tip I ever got.


1709
01:00:26.358 --> 01:00:28.941
And he looks very happy.

1710
01:00:29.024 --> 01:00:30.857
And that's all
that really matters, right?


1711
01:00:30.941 --> 01:00:32.440
Yeah.

1712
01:00:32.524 --> 01:00:33.857
You know what,

1713
01:00:33.941 --> 01:00:35.482
Nick, I just want
to say thank you


1714
01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:37.233
for including me here today.

1715
01:00:37.316 --> 01:00:38.857
I had a great time.

1716
01:00:38.941 --> 01:00:41.566
I had a great time watching you
juggle all those plates.


1717
01:00:41.649 --> 01:00:42.816
Yeah, it's good to know

1718
01:00:42.899 --> 01:00:44.275
I still have a skill
I can fall back on.


1719
01:00:44.358 --> 01:00:45.691
I'm sure you've got
more than one.


1720
01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:50.400
I know it's not like
being a professional chef,


1721
01:00:50.482 --> 01:00:51.816
but I was a short-order cook.

1722
01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:53.400
Seriously?

1723
01:00:53.482 --> 01:00:55.149
Yeah, seriously. Why
are you looking so surprised?


1724
01:00:55.233 --> 01:00:57.316
What can I say?
You're full of surprises.


1725
01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.566
You're welcome to come over
for dinner tonight.


1726
01:00:58.649 --> 01:01:00.607
I'd like to prove it to you.

1727
01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:02.941
Huh. I do have the night off.

1728
01:01:03.024 --> 01:01:04.691
Are you sure?
Most people are afraid


1729
01:01:04.774 --> 01:01:06.566
to have a chef
over to their house for dinner,


1730
01:01:06.649 --> 01:01:07.941
they're afraid their cooking
is not gonna measure up.


1731
01:01:08.024 --> 01:01:09.399
Well, I'm not afraid.

1732
01:01:09.482 --> 01:01:10.358
I like a challenge.

1733
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.233
Game on.

1734
01:01:17.983 --> 01:01:19.191
-
-Come on, in, Nick.


1735
01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.440
Door's open.

1736
01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.358
So, I wasn't sure
what you were cooking tonight,


1737
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.566
so I brought
a little rosso e bianco.


1738
01:01:26.649 --> 01:01:28.233
Thank you so much. Perfect.

1739
01:01:28.316 --> 01:01:30.482
Mm. It smells good.

1740
01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:32.233
It's not Italian,
but it smells good.


1741
01:01:32.316 --> 01:01:33.774
Well, I thought we could have
something different.


1742
01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.524
Went with an American classic.

1743
01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:36.649
Sloppy Joes.

1744
01:01:36.732 --> 01:01:38.482
-Sloppy Joes?
-Comfort food.


1745
01:01:38.566 --> 01:01:40.066
Oh, that's why
I didn't recognize it.


1746
01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:41.649
You've had it before, right?

1747
01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:42.691
No, I have not.

1748
01:01:42.774 --> 01:01:44.149
How is that even possible?

1749
01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.482
Hey, I'm Italian.

1750
01:01:45.566 --> 01:01:48.649
You know? We do
the meat-ah-ball-ah sub-ah.


1751
01:01:48.732 --> 01:01:51.275
You need to know
that I survived on this recipe


1752
01:01:51.357 --> 01:01:52.440
when I was in college,

1753
01:01:52.524 --> 01:01:54.899
so I like to think

1754
01:01:54.983 --> 01:01:56.566
that I perfected it.

1755
01:02:01.066 --> 01:02:02.024
Mm-hmm.

1756
01:02:03.774 --> 01:02:05.149
Very good.

1757
01:02:05.233 --> 01:02:06.482
Mm. Mwah.

1758
01:02:06.566 --> 01:02:07.607
But it needs something?

1759
01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.191
What? No. No, no, no.

1760
01:02:09.275 --> 01:02:10.566
|-| am the guest tonight,
you are the cook,


1761
01:02:10.649 --> 01:02:11.816
so whatever you think.

1762
01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:13.816
Right, but you're
a professional chef.


1763
01:02:13.899 --> 01:02:15.275
You would know.

1764
01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:16.983
|-| can take it,
I can handle the truth.


1765
01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.233
Okay. Maybe
it could use a little cumin.


1766
01:02:19.316 --> 01:02:21.899
Cumin? Okay. Cumin.

1767
01:02:23.275 --> 01:02:24.399
Urn...

1768
01:02:24.482 --> 01:02:25.691
Okay, garlic powder...

1769
01:02:25.774 --> 01:02:27.316
Wow, you've got
a lot of seasonings there.


1770
01:02:27.399 --> 01:02:28.899
Let me check--
I'm gonna reach over here.


1771
01:02:31.774 --> 01:02:33.607
Okay, what's... Oh!

1772
01:02:35.399 --> 01:02:36.566
There we go.

1773
01:02:36.649 --> 01:02:37.899
Yeah, you found it.

1774
01:02:37.983 --> 01:02:39.399
I found it. You mind? Yeah?

1775
01:02:39.482 --> 01:02:41.524
Oh, no. Please.
Here. Go ahead.


1776
01:02:41.607 --> 01:02:42.857
All right.

1777
01:02:45.649 --> 01:02:46.732
Okay.

1778
01:02:48.941 --> 01:02:50.482
We mix this up a little...

1779
01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:51.691
see that wrist movement
back there?


1780
01:02:51.774 --> 01:02:53.066
There's a flair to it.

1781
01:02:53.149 --> 01:02:54.774
This is just cooking.

1782
01:02:54.857 --> 01:02:57.233
Bring your tastebuds over here.

1783
01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.649
I don't want to get this
on your pretty dress,


1784
01:02:58.732 --> 01:02:59.399
-so, careful.
-'Kay.


1785
01:03:04.315 --> 01:03:06.233
That's amazing! Oh, my gosh.

1786
01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:08.482
It's so much better.

1787
01:03:08.566 --> 01:03:10.233
You'd think
I do this for a living.


1788
01:03:10.315 --> 01:03:11.732
Yeah! Well, dinner is ready.

1789
01:03:11.816 --> 01:03:12.774
You know, sometimes,
it's just the simplest things


1790
01:03:12.857 --> 01:03:13.691
that surprise you.

1791
01:03:13.774 --> 01:03:14.691
Yeah.

1792
01:03:14.774 --> 01:03:16.274
Okay.

1793
01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:17.857
I will set the table.

1794
01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:19.691
Oh. Oh, thank you.

1795
01:03:19.774 --> 01:03:22.440
Yeah, you can just
move my stuff anywhere.


1796
01:03:22.524 --> 01:03:24.233
What,
are you researching Narula?


1797
01:03:24.315 --> 01:03:26.191
I want to get to him

1798
01:03:26.274 --> 01:03:28.899
without having to wait
for another meeting.


1799
01:03:28.983 --> 01:03:30.732
I've just been doing
a lot of research on him.


1800
01:03:30.816 --> 01:03:31.983
I even found out

1801
01:03:32.066 --> 01:03:34.024
what neighborhood he's from
in Queens,


1802
01:03:34.108 --> 01:03:36.024
and where he eats breakfast
there every Sunday.


1803
01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:37.857
Wow.

1804
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:40.857
So which wine should I open--
the red or the white with this?


1805
01:03:40.941 --> 01:03:42.816
Mm, good question.

1806
01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:44.191
You know,
we're doing sloppy Joes,


1807
01:03:44.274 --> 01:03:45.774
so maybe
I have a better option.


1808
01:03:45.857 --> 01:03:46.732
Beer.

1809
01:03:47.983 --> 01:03:49.108
Are you reading my mind?

1810
01:03:50.482 --> 01:03:52.649
Great minds think alike.

1811
01:03:52.732 --> 01:03:54.899
Cheers.

1812
01:03:56.357 --> 01:03:58.607
Oh, this is it.

1813
01:03:58.691 --> 01:04:00.732
Oh, there he is,
he's in that back booth.


1814
01:04:00.816 --> 01:04:01.941
Oh, yeah.

1815
01:04:02.024 --> 01:04:04.440
Okay. Uh, you got this, okay?

1816
01:04:04.524 --> 01:04:05.732
Don't forget to breathe.

1817
01:04:07.066 --> 01:04:08.191
-All right. Let's go.
-Okay.


1818
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.857
Well, here goes nothing.

1819
01:04:11.941 --> 01:04:13.691
Go get 'em, tiger.

1820
01:04:18.149 --> 01:04:19.524
Mr. Narula?

1821
01:04:19.607 --> 01:04:21.149
-Yes?
-I am is Tracy Goodwyn,


1822
01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:23.524
I work at
the Metropolitan Auction House.


1823
01:04:23.607 --> 01:04:26.774
We were meant to have
a meeting last week


1824
01:04:26.857 --> 01:04:28.066
and you were unable to attend.

1825
01:04:28.149 --> 01:04:30.191
Anyway, I'm really sorry
for intruding like this.


1826
01:04:30.274 --> 01:04:32.024
It's not the kind of thing
I usually do.


1827
01:04:32.108 --> 01:04:34.857
I usually eat my breakfast
alone without interruptions.


1828
01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:36.607
I know. Yeah. I read that.

1829
01:04:36.691 --> 01:04:38.274
I'm sorry... about this,

1830
01:04:38.357 --> 01:04:40.399
but I really need
a moment of your time.


1831
01:04:40.482 --> 01:04:41.524
My eggs are getting cold.

1832
01:04:42.941 --> 01:04:45.024
Of course. Right. Sorry.

1833
01:04:45.108 --> 01:04:46.774
That's the third time
you're apologizing.


1834
01:04:46.857 --> 01:04:48.274
Are you done?

1835
01:04:48.357 --> 01:04:50.607
Apologizing?
Yes, actually.


1836
01:04:50.691 --> 01:04:51.857
Pretty sure I am.

1837
01:04:53.691 --> 01:04:56.274
Then let me apologize to you
for canceling our meeting.


1838
01:04:56.357 --> 01:04:58.232
Please, sit down,

1839
01:04:58.315 --> 01:05:01.066
so I can at least eat my food
while it's still warm.


1840
01:05:01.149 --> 01:05:03.691
Great. Okay.

1841
01:05:03.774 --> 01:05:06.066
Ah! Yes.

1842
01:05:08.482 --> 01:05:09.983
-Well?
-Yeah, uh...


1843
01:05:10.066 --> 01:05:11.232
I think it went really well.

1844
01:05:11.315 --> 01:05:13.649
He said that he wasn't sure yet,

1845
01:05:13.732 --> 01:05:15.315
but he told me
to write up a proposal


1846
01:05:15.399 --> 01:05:16.190
and he said he would
show it to his lawyers.


1847
01:05:16.274 --> 01:05:17.482
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

1848
01:05:17.566 --> 01:05:19.274
I did express urgency to him,
you know,


1849
01:05:19.357 --> 01:05:21.357
that the auction
was only a few days away.


1850
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.983
What do you have to do?
Just write a proposal, right?


1851
01:05:23.066 --> 01:05:25.440
Only the best proposal
of my entire life.


1852
01:05:25.524 --> 01:05:26.983
You got this!

1853
01:05:27.066 --> 01:05:28.649
Let's go back to Da Nonna,
I'll cook you breakfast,


1854
01:05:28.732 --> 01:05:29.774
and you can write
this amazing proposal.


1855
01:05:29.857 --> 01:05:31.066
No, |-| probably--

1856
01:05:31.148 --> 01:05:32.399
Well...

1857
01:05:32.482 --> 01:05:34.190
there gonna be cannolis?

1858
01:05:34.274 --> 01:05:35.857
Of course! Cannolis, yes.
You earned it. Come on.


1859
01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:36.941
Okay.

1860
01:05:37.024 --> 01:05:38.066
-Just one.
-Yes. Maybe five.


1861
01:05:45.482 --> 01:05:46.524
What was that?

1862
01:05:46.607 --> 01:05:48.232
Those are
the sapphire earrings.


1863
01:05:48.315 --> 01:05:50.566
Someone put
a pre-emptive offer on 'em.


1864
01:05:50.649 --> 01:05:51.482
I never got to try them on.

1865
01:05:51.566 --> 01:05:53.108
Yeah. Okay--

1866
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:54.732
-Can we go over the checklist?
-Yeah.


1867
01:05:54.816 --> 01:05:58.024
Only thing that's left to do
is tag the auction items.


1868
01:05:58.108 --> 01:05:59.315
Okay, but don't tag
the Lazarus poem just yet.


1869
01:05:59.399 --> 01:06:00.482
Still nothing from Narula?

1870
01:06:00.566 --> 01:06:01.816
No.

1871
01:06:01.899 --> 01:06:04.274
But I think it's just him
and his lawyers


1872
01:06:04.357 --> 01:06:05.983
going over all the paperwork.
It's complicated, you know?


1873
01:06:06.066 --> 01:06:07.274
It's not just a purchase,

1874
01:06:07.357 --> 01:06:09.357
it's a purchase,
and then a donation.


1875
01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.774
Right.

1876
01:06:10.857 --> 01:06:12.899
Okay, well,
should we go to lunch?


1877
01:06:12.983 --> 01:06:15.066
I have to work through it
because I'm leaving early


1878
01:06:15.148 --> 01:06:16.440
to meet Nick
at my mom's gallery.


1879
01:06:16.524 --> 01:06:18.024
You two are becoming
quite a regular thing.


1880
01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:18.941
Should I be jealous?

1881
01:06:19.024 --> 01:06:20.607
Of course not.

1882
01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:22.649
You'll always be
my work husband.


1883
01:06:22.732 --> 01:06:23.941
-Mwah!
-I'll take it.


1884
01:06:24.024 --> 01:06:25.732
The new paintings
I want to show you


1885
01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:26.774
are right over here.

1886
01:06:26.857 --> 01:06:29.566
Ah, fantastic.

1887
01:06:29.649 --> 01:06:31.732
More of what
we were looking for.


1888
01:06:31.816 --> 01:06:32.983
Good.

1889
01:06:33.066 --> 01:06:34.107
See, this reminds me
of Verona.


1890
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.816
That's where my grandmother
was born.


1891
01:06:35.899 --> 01:06:36.607
Ah.

1892
01:06:36.732 --> 01:06:39.274
That makes sense.
The painter's Italian.


1893
01:06:39.357 --> 01:06:42.566
Hmm. I don't think it's quite
what we're looking for,


1894
01:06:42.649 --> 01:06:43.816
for Tesoro Mio.

1895
01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:44.774
What-
- What do you think?

1896
01:06:44.857 --> 01:06:45.774
Probably not.

1897
01:06:45.857 --> 01:06:48.107
Okay.

1898
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:50.357
Let me see.
What else do we have?


1899
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.524
This speaks to me.

1900
01:06:52.607 --> 01:06:54.691
Reminds me of that day
down by the water.


1901
01:06:54.774 --> 01:06:55.941
Yeah.

1902
01:06:56.024 --> 01:06:57.148
I know what you mean.

1903
01:06:58.774 --> 01:07:00.524
The day we were at the water,
it was very cold.


1904
01:07:00.607 --> 01:07:02.357
Well, maybe
it was cold this day, too,


1905
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.440
and the artist decided to paint
blue skies instead of clouds.


1906
01:07:05.524 --> 01:07:07.065
I hadn't realized
you were an optimist.


1907
01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.232
It's one of
my better qualities.


1908
01:07:10.566 --> 01:07:11.566
You have a few.

1909
01:07:13.357 --> 01:07:15.607
I see you found one you like.

1910
01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:17.941
It's called "Cielo Blu".

1911
01:07:18.024 --> 01:07:20.732
Mm. "Blue Sky." Weird.

1912
01:07:22.357 --> 01:07:23.649
The artist is Italian.

1913
01:07:23.732 --> 01:07:25.023
So's the guy buying it.

1914
01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:26.065
Sold!

1915
01:07:38.691 --> 01:07:40.023
You did good.

1916
01:07:40.107 --> 01:07:42.232
In fact, the whole restaurant
looks good.


1917
01:07:42.315 --> 01:07:45.399
Ah, well, thanks to you.
You had a lot to do with it.


1918
01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.566
I'm not just talking about
picking out the bars tools.


1919
01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:50.732
Ah, it's gonna be so weird
running my own kitchen


1920
01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.440
when you move over here.

1921
01:07:52.524 --> 01:07:53.899
You know something? I think
we're both gonna be just fine.


1922
01:07:53.983 --> 01:07:55.649
Where did you find it?

1923
01:07:55.732 --> 01:07:58.315
That? Uh...
from the Sarah Goodwyn Gallery.


1924
01:07:58.399 --> 01:08:00.566
As in... Tracy Goodwyn?

1925
01:08:00.649 --> 01:08:03.440
Yes. That's her mother.

1926
01:08:03.524 --> 01:08:05.482
Then I wouldn't say
I'm the only one


1927
01:08:05.566 --> 01:08:06.649
around here
who's been helpful.


1928
01:08:06.732 --> 01:08:08.399
Huh.

1929
01:08:08.482 --> 01:08:10.148
Have you asked her out yet,
on a real date?


1930
01:08:10.232 --> 01:08:11.982
Yeah, does pizza count?

1931
01:08:12.065 --> 01:08:13.232
Yeah, if you're in college.

1932
01:08:14.649 --> 01:08:17.232
Thank you, Oh, wise sage.

1933
01:08:21.315 --> 01:08:22.440
They have me on hold again.

1934
01:08:22.524 --> 01:08:23.524
Well, what'd they say?

1935
01:08:23.607 --> 01:08:25.232
Just that
they can't find Narula


1936
01:08:25.315 --> 01:08:26.816
so they're gonna try
to track down his lawyer.


1937
01:08:27.982 --> 01:08:29.148
When?

1938
01:08:29.232 --> 01:08:30.816
Okay, okay.

1939
01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:32.524
But please just make sure

1940
01:08:32.607 --> 01:08:34.691
that he knows that the auction's
meant to start any moment.


1941
01:08:34.774 --> 01:08:36.065
Thank you.

1942
01:08:37.566 --> 01:08:39.148
Anything?

1943
01:08:39.232 --> 01:08:41.232
I can't wait any longer.
I have to start.


1944
01:08:43.524 --> 01:08:45.774
-Good morning, everyone!
- Sorry.


1945
01:08:45.857 --> 01:08:47.566
Thank you for coming.

1946
01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:50.566
We've got some very nice items

01:08:53.482 --> 01:08:55.440
Bidding begins at $220,000.

1950
01:08:55.524 --> 01:08:56.857

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.857

And 375 on the phone.

Do I hear 400?
Last chance.


1957
01:09:08.315 --> 01:09:10.399
All right, then.
It is...


1958
01:09:10.482 --> 01:09:11.857
sold!

1959
01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.566
For $375,000
to the bidder on the phone.


1960
01:09:15.857 --> 01:09:17.357
Well, we're moving along now.

1961
01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.940
Our next item,
lot number 844,


1962
01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:22.107
is a handwritten draft
of the poem


1963
01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:23.399
by Emma Lazarus,

1964
01:09:23.482 --> 01:09:24.732
"The New Colossus."

1965
01:09:24.816 --> 01:09:26.566
-Written in 1883...
-


1966
01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:27.816
...this early draft
of the poem


1967
01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:30.274
was engraved
on the Statue of Liberty.


1968
01:09:30.357 --> 01:09:31.732
Ahem.

1969
01:09:31.816 --> 01:09:32.566
EXCUSE me a moment.

1970
01:09:36.732 --> 01:09:38.399
I've just been informed

1971
01:09:38.482 --> 01:09:40.857
that this item has, in fact,
been withdrawn,


1972
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.107
so we shall move straightaway
onto our next one,


1973
01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:46.232
lot number 845.

1974
01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:47.357
It is a first edition...

1975
01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:50.274
Here you go.
You did it!


1976
01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:51.399
Oh, We did it.

1977
01:09:51.482 --> 01:09:52.898
Okay,I'll buy that.

1978
01:09:52.982 --> 01:09:54.399
Cheers.

1979
01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:56.357
If I may,

1980
01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.190
I would like to thank
each and every one of you


1981
01:09:58.274 --> 01:10:01.482
for making today's auction
an amazing success,


1982
01:10:01.566 --> 01:10:02.940
and I especially want
to thank Tracy,


1983
01:10:03.023 --> 01:10:04.440
who went out on a limb

1984
01:10:04.524 --> 01:10:06.315
to save a very important part
of American history.


1985
01:10:06.399 --> 01:10:07.940
Cheers!

1986
01:10:08.023 --> 01:10:09.566
- Cheers!
-Thank you.


1987
01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.190
That was definitely
a day to remember.


1988
01:10:14.274 --> 01:10:16.190
Oh, best day ever.

1989
01:10:16.274 --> 01:10:19.065
And the look
on Carter Wainwright's face--


1990
01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:20.940
-So good!
-...When Leland just


1991
01:10:21.023 --> 01:10:22.898
pulled the poem
away from him! Oh!


1992
01:10:22.982 --> 01:10:26.190
That alone was worth
at least a million dollars.


1993
01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:27.649
Oh, and I am so glad

1994
01:10:27.732 --> 01:10:29.107
that you were there
to share it with me.


1995
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.357
-Oh!
-Me too.


1996
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.816
I wouldn't have missed it
for anything.


1997
01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.856
Ah, well, uh... here we are.

1998
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:42.856
Thanks again.

1999
01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:43.982
Thank you.

2000
01:11:04.607 --> 01:11:05.982
I'm sorry.

2001
01:11:06.065 --> 01:11:08.649
We just got caught up
in the moment, you know?


2002
01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:11.774
Well, it's a moment
I was hoping would happen.


2003
01:11:11.856 --> 01:11:13.815
I just wasn't sure
you felt the same.


2004
01:11:15.357 --> 01:11:18.399
I'm not sure I'm ready
to feel that way.


2005
01:11:19.649 --> 01:11:21.232
I get it.

2006
01:11:21.315 --> 01:11:22.566
We can take it slow.

2007
01:11:22.649 --> 01:11:23.732
Slow feels...

2008
01:11:23.815 --> 01:11:25.274
too fast

2009
01:11:25.357 --> 01:11:28.148
for me, right now.

2010
01:11:28.232 --> 01:11:29.607
I'm sorry.

2011
01:11:29.691 --> 01:11:31.232
Have I been misreading things?

2012
01:11:31.315 --> 01:11:34.399
No. It's me.

2013
01:11:34.482 --> 01:11:39.232
|-| think I've been
sending you mixed messages.


2014
01:11:39.315 --> 01:11:41.148
Or maybe I've just
been reading them wrong.


2015
01:11:41.232 --> 01:11:42.440
Now, if you're not ready,
you're not ready.


2016
01:11:42.524 --> 01:11:43.524
I totally understand.

2017
01:11:43.607 --> 01:11:45.649
I'm sorry.

2018
01:11:45.732 --> 01:11:47.148
Don't be.

2019
01:11:47.232 --> 01:11:48.773
You're being honest with me,

2020
01:11:48.856 --> 01:11:50.898
and that is totally admirable
and I appreciate it.


2021
01:11:53.524 --> 01:11:56.148
Maybe we should just, uh,
call it a night?


2022
01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:01.065
Thank you.

2023
01:12:03.107 --> 01:12:04.898
Thank you.

2024
01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.691
This is a good home for it.

2025
01:12:35.773 --> 01:12:37.607
I think Emma Lazarus
would feel the same way.


2026
01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:39.482
Thank you so much, Mr. Narula.

2027
01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:42.898
It's a pleasure.

2028
01:12:45.107 --> 01:12:46.856
Congratulations, Tracy.
-Leland, thank you.


2029
01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:47.815
Thank you.

2030
01:12:49.731 --> 01:12:51.524
I still can't believe
it's here.


2031
01:12:51.607 --> 01:12:53.731
Stanley.
Mwah. We did it together.


2032
01:12:53.815 --> 01:12:54.940
-No, no, no.
-We made it happen.


2033
01:12:55.023 --> 01:12:56.315
-This was all you.
-It was a team.


2034
01:12:56.399 --> 01:12:57.524
It was a team. Okay.
I'll see you later.


2035
01:12:59.566 --> 01:13:00.399
-Mom!
-All finished?


2036
01:13:00.482 --> 01:13:02.023
Thank you for waiting.

2037
01:13:02.107 --> 01:13:03.566
Oh, honey.

2038
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:06.190
I am so proud
of all that you've done here.


2039
01:13:06.274 --> 01:13:07.357
Thank you so much.

2040
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.607
I'm a little surprised

2041
01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:10.107
you wanted
to have dinner with me tonight.


2042
01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.690
-What?
-I would've thought


2043
01:13:11.773 --> 01:13:14.690
you'd want to celebrate
this special moment with Nick.


2044
01:13:14.773 --> 01:13:19.274
No. Well, things just got
a little complicated.


2045
01:13:19.357 --> 01:13:22.649
Ah. Sounds like
a romantic complication.


2046
01:13:24.856 --> 01:13:28.566
Honey, I'm your mom, remember?

2047
01:13:28.649 --> 01:13:30.566
I'd have to be blind not to see

2048
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:32.856
there was something
going on with you two.


2049
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:35.399
The truth is,
I'm the one who was blind.


2050
01:13:35.482 --> 01:13:37.648
I didn't realize how close
Nick and I had gotten


2051
01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:39.982
until he told me how he felt,
and I...


2052
01:13:40.065 --> 01:13:41.107
and I got scared.

2053
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:42.566
Scared of what?

2054
01:13:42.648 --> 01:13:44.315
Scared of...

2055
01:13:44.399 --> 01:13:45.856
...how I feel about him.

2056
01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.566
Oh, honey.

2057
01:13:48.648 --> 01:13:50.815
Nick is a "forever"
kind of guy,


2058
01:13:50.898 --> 01:13:53.856
and you can't confuse that
with Finn,


2059
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.898
or even your father and I.

2060
01:13:55.982 --> 01:13:57.856
All these years,
I've watched


2061
01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:01.232
as you let our divorce
color your relationships,


2062
01:14:01.315 --> 01:14:03.274
and the fact of the matter is,

2063
01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:05.731
your dad and I just weren't
right for each other.


2064
01:14:07.274 --> 01:14:09.399
But you and Nick are.

2065
01:14:14.107 --> 01:14:16.232
Yeah.

2066
01:14:20.815 --> 01:14:21.898
Hello?

2067
01:14:21.982 --> 01:14:23.606
-Hi.
-Are you okay?


2068
01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:25.274
Did Stanley call you?

2069
01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:26.357
We promised
we wouldn't say.


2070
01:14:27.606 --> 01:14:30.107
So you know
about Nick and me?


2071
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:31.232
And since
you're on your trampoline,


2072
01:14:31.315 --> 01:14:32.940
I'm guessing you're not okay.

2073
01:14:33.023 --> 01:14:34.566
Trampolines are great
for stress.


2074
01:14:34.648 --> 01:14:36.982
Your problem isn't stress,
it's matters of the heart.


2075
01:14:37.065 --> 01:14:39.107
So you should probably
get off the trampoline


2076
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:40.773
and get over
to Nick's restaurant.


2077
01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:42.482
It's the 30th.
His opening.


2078
01:14:42.566 --> 01:14:44.815
I don't think
that I am welcome there.


2079
01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:46.440
That didn't stop you
with Rangan Narula.


2080
01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:47.357
Get over there!

2081
01:14:51.357 --> 01:14:52.357
Ladies.

2082
01:15:03.856 --> 01:15:05.023
Hi...

2083
01:15:05.107 --> 01:15:07.565
Hi.

2084
01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:10.190
|-|-| was hoping

2085
01:15:10.274 --> 01:15:12.315
that the shitake mushroom
ravioli would...


2086
01:15:12.399 --> 01:15:14.982
be on the menu tonight.

2087
01:15:15.065 --> 01:15:17.524
Hoping that's not the reason
that you came by.


2088
01:15:17.606 --> 01:15:20.982
No. The man who made it
is why I'm here.


2089
01:15:21.065 --> 01:15:23.856
Well, hate to break it to you,
but technically,


2090
01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.648
my nonna made it tonight.
She tried it,


2091
01:15:25.731 --> 01:15:27.274
and then when she did,
she went all in,


2092
01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:28.357
but I get where you're going.

2093
01:15:32.606 --> 01:15:33.898
I should've come up
with a better opening line.


2094
01:15:35.232 --> 01:15:36.940
No, you're doing just fine.

2095
01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:39.898
Good, 'cause...

2096
01:15:39.982 --> 01:15:41.898
that's my best material.

2097
01:15:43.315 --> 01:15:45.606
So I'm sorry.

2098
01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:47.773
And the--
And the truth is...


2099
01:15:47.856 --> 01:15:48.982
the truth is,

2100
01:15:49.065 --> 01:15:51.523
you're not misreading anything.

2101
01:15:53.565 --> 01:15:56.648
So what you're saying is
that if I was to kiss you,


2102
01:15:56.731 --> 01:15:57.690
you won't push me away?

2103
01:15:59.399 --> 01:16:02.565
Well, it better be
a good kiss.


2104
01:16:02.648 --> 01:16:04.856
But what constitutes
a good kiss?


2105
01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.232
Who cares
if she's not Italian?


2106
01:16:19.523 --> 01:16:21.399
That was a great kiss.

2107
01:16:25.357 --> 01:16:26.565
They make a wonderful couple!

2108
01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.232
Eh?

2109
01:16:39.023 --> 01:16:40.898
You look so beautiful.

2110
01:16:40.982 --> 01:16:42.148
Oh, thank you.

2111
01:16:42.232 --> 01:16:43.690
Have you heard from Emma?

2112
01:16:43.773 --> 01:16:45.190
Yes, she landed.
She's on her way right now.


2113
01:16:45.274 --> 01:16:46.815
Okay. Okay, great.

2114
01:16:46.898 --> 01:16:47.690
Look at
our beautiful bride.


2115
01:16:47.773 --> 01:16:48.606
-Bellissima!
-Aw!


2116
01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:50.357
Oh, thank you.

2117
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.773
Did Tracy tell you

2118
01:16:51.856 --> 01:16:53.523
that's the same veil
that was worn


2119
01:16:53.606 --> 01:16:56.107
by a contessa
in a 19th-century painting?


2120
01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.274
She told us all about
the painting


2121
01:16:57.357 --> 01:16:58.773
and the veil
and the legend.


2122
01:16:58.856 --> 01:17:02.065
Seems like it's coming true
for all three of you.


2123
01:17:02.148 --> 01:17:03.065
-
-Hi!


2124
01:17:03.148 --> 01:17:04.440
Yay!

2125
01:17:04.523 --> 01:17:05.565
Sorry I'm so late!

2126
01:17:05.648 --> 01:17:07.065
After my flight got canceled,

2127
01:17:07.148 --> 01:17:08.232
we were able
to find another one,


2128
01:17:08.315 --> 01:17:09.399
but then there was
only one seat,


2129
01:17:09.481 --> 01:17:12.731
so Paolo
is on the next flight out.


2130
01:17:12.815 --> 01:17:14.439
You look so stunning. Oh!

2131
01:17:14.523 --> 01:17:16.399
I have so much to tell you both.

2132
01:17:16.481 --> 01:17:18.315
-Okay, but you--
-Hi!


2133
01:17:18.399 --> 01:17:19.940
But you need to take
a very deep breath.


2134
01:17:20.023 --> 01:17:21.065
-
-And you need to get dressed.


2135
01:17:21.148 --> 01:17:23.648
Okay. So.

2136
01:17:23.731 --> 01:17:26.606
I managed to track down
how the veil got to America.


2137
01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:28.481
It took me a while,
but I was able


2138
01:17:28.565 --> 01:17:29.690
to get in touch Hilda--

2139
01:17:29.773 --> 01:17:30.523
She's the woman
We bought the veil from.


2140
01:17:30.606 --> 01:17:31.982
Okay.

2141
01:17:32.065 --> 01:17:33.357
She was able to find
her mother's bill of sale


2142
01:17:33.439 --> 01:17:34.315
for the veil
and some jewelry--


2143
01:17:34.399 --> 01:17:35.856
She bought it in New York

2144
01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.690
in 1948,

2145
01:17:37.773 --> 01:17:39.940
and you are never gonna guess
who she bought it from.


2146
01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:41.357
Angela Diconcini.

2147
01:17:41.439 --> 01:17:42.606
What?

2148
01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:43.648
-Yeah.
-That's Arianna's granddaughter.


2149
01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:45.940
Angela Diconcini
was my mother.


2150
01:17:46.023 --> 01:17:47.232
What?

2151
01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:51.690
Not when it comes to our veil,
it isn't.


2152
01:17:51.773 --> 01:17:52.606
No, no. Wait a second.

2153
01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:53.982
So you're saying

2154
01:17:54.065 --> 01:17:55.065
Angela was your mother?
Claudia's daughter?


2155
01:17:55.148 --> 01:17:56.065
Yes!

2156
01:17:57.398 --> 01:17:58.940
I've gotta get dressed.

2157
01:17:59.023 --> 01:18:00.398
Do you know
why she sold the veil?


2158
01:18:00.481 --> 01:18:03.731
Well, |-| know my mother
sold some family heirlooms


2159
01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:04.815
when we got to America,

2160
01:18:04.898 --> 01:18:06.690
for money
to open our restaurant--


2161
01:18:06.773 --> 01:18:07.856
Yeah.

2162
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.315
...But, until today,

2163
01:18:09.398 --> 01:18:12.023
I had no idea
what those heirlooms were.


2164
01:18:12.107 --> 01:18:15.065
Can someone please explain
what this all means?


2165
01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:17.232
What I think it means
is that Nick's family


2166
01:18:17.315 --> 01:18:19.398
are direct descendants
of Arianna and Amici.


2167
01:18:19.481 --> 01:18:20.940
Oh!

2168
01:18:21.023 --> 01:18:22.856
And that Paolo
has even more cousins!


2169
01:18:24.357 --> 01:18:25.731
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2170
01:18:25.815 --> 01:18:28.357
Now, I get that this Arianna
was in the painting,


2171
01:18:28.439 --> 01:18:30.731
but how exactly
is she related to us?


2172
01:18:30.815 --> 01:18:31.773
I got this.

2173
01:18:31.856 --> 01:18:32.940
And I got her.

2174
01:18:33.023 --> 01:18:34.982
Okay, so, Arianna and Amici--

2175
01:18:35.065 --> 01:18:37.690
Amici was the artist
who painted the portrait--


2176
01:18:37.773 --> 01:18:39.107
They fell in love,

2177
01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:41.315
and they had
a baby named Claudia,


2178
01:18:41.398 --> 01:18:44.523
but she was adopted
by Arianna's chambermaid,


2179
01:18:44.606 --> 01:18:45.773
Carmela.

2180
01:18:45.856 --> 01:18:48.606
Carmela was
my great-grandmother!


2181
01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.731
At least,
I thought so before today.


2182
01:18:50.815 --> 01:18:52.565
Which also means...

2183
01:18:52.648 --> 01:18:55.356
you two are cousins,
by marriage.


2184
01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:56.523
Oh!

2185
01:18:56.606 --> 01:18:57.815
And I'm so jealous!

2186
01:18:57.898 --> 01:18:59.274
No, no, no.

2187
01:18:59.356 --> 01:19:00.439
No, we're all three
still sisters.


2188
01:19:00.523 --> 01:19:02.148
Yes, yes, forever!

2189
01:19:02.232 --> 01:19:03.731
We should take our seats.

2190
01:19:03.815 --> 01:19:05.023
Come on, Mom.

2191
01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.232
See you out there.

2192
01:19:06.315 --> 01:19:07.856
Bye.

2193
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.648
Thank you.

2194
01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:15.898
It's your turn, Tracy.

2195
01:19:15.982 --> 01:19:17.898
Are you nervous?

2196
01:19:17.982 --> 01:19:19.314
No.

2197
01:19:19.398 --> 01:19:21.940
I'm not
'cause you both are by my side.


2198
01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:24.232
We have been through
quite a lot together,


2199
01:19:24.314 --> 01:19:25.356
haven't we?

2200
01:19:25.439 --> 01:19:26.606
We certainly have.

2201
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:28.065
Good and bad...

2202
01:19:28.148 --> 01:19:29.523
mostly good.

2203
01:19:29.606 --> 01:19:31.148
Ups and downs...
but mostly ups.


2204
01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:35.648
And no matter where we are...

2205
01:19:35.731 --> 01:19:38.023
we are always there
for each other.


2206
01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.856
Okay.

2207
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:41.898
Let's get you married!

2208
01:19:41.982 --> 01:19:43.648
That's a good idea.

2209
01:19:46.606 --> 01:19:47.398
Okay.

2210
01:19:51.148 --> 01:19:52.731
Well...

2211
01:19:52.815 --> 01:19:54.439
if you're gonna
make me admit it,


2212
01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:56.773
I am very glad
that we bought the veil.


2213
01:19:56.856 --> 01:19:59.731
Because you finally
believe in the legend?


2214
01:19:59.815 --> 01:20:02.232
No.
Because it matches my dress.


2215
01:20:02.314 --> 01:20:04.023
-
-You're impossible.


2216
01:20:33.648 --> 01:20:34.856
You look beautiful.

2217
01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:36.731
You look handsome.

2218
01:20:36.815 --> 01:20:38.815
So I got you
a little something.


2219
01:20:38.898 --> 01:20:39.856
-What?
-A little wedding gift.


2220
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.273
Oh...

2221
01:20:42.606 --> 01:20:44.773
Nick!

2222
01:20:44.856 --> 01:20:46.648
You were the anonymous buyer
at the auction house?


2223
01:20:46.731 --> 01:20:48.107
As soon as I saw these,

2224
01:20:48.190 --> 01:20:49.148
I knew that
they were meant for you.


2225
01:20:49.231 --> 01:20:51.898
They are perfect.
I love them.


2226
01:20:51.982 --> 01:20:53.565
I hope so.

2227
01:20:55.314 --> 01:20:57.898
And now I think I remember
where I've seen these before.


2228
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.023
Thank you.

2229
01:21:02.815 --> 01:21:05.148
I have never
seen Tracy happier.


2230
01:21:05.231 --> 01:21:07.481
That's because she found
what we have.


2231
01:21:07.565 --> 01:21:09.273
You're becoming
as romantic as I am.


2232
01:21:15.815 --> 01:21:17.314
Wow.

2233
01:21:17.398 --> 01:21:19.606
Hilda's bill of sale
included sapphire earrings?


2234
01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:22.273
These have to be the earrings
from Arianna's portrait.


2235
01:21:22.356 --> 01:21:24.523
I see the painting
every single day in the museum.


2236
01:21:24.606 --> 01:21:27.898
I can positively tell you
those are her earrings.


2237
01:21:27.982 --> 01:21:29.481
That's amazing.

2238
01:21:29.565 --> 01:21:30.898
Does you believe
in the legend now?


2239
01:21:32.815 --> 01:21:33.856
I don't know.

2240
01:21:36.773 --> 01:21:39.815
I do feel that Arianna's spirit
is looking out for us.


2241
01:21:39.898 --> 01:21:41.065
Can you just say
you believe in the veil?


2242
01:21:41.148 --> 01:21:41.856
'Cause I can't take it anymore.

2243
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:45.107
It's a definite "maybe".

2244
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:46.023
I'll take it!

2245
01:21:48.398 --> 01:21:50.314
But, ladies, we do have
one thing left to do.


2246
01:21:50.398 --> 01:21:51.398
What? Toss the bouquet?

2247
01:21:51.481 --> 01:21:52.940
None of us needs it anymore.

2248
01:21:53.023 --> 01:21:55.565
No. Actually, I was, um,
thinking about something else.


2249
01:21:55.648 --> 01:21:57.606
Congratulations.

2250
01:21:57.690 --> 01:21:58.690
You are now officially

2251
01:21:58.773 --> 01:22:00.023
a member of
the Wedding Veil Club.


2252
01:22:01.565 --> 01:22:03.231
You don't believe
in that legend, do you?


2253
01:22:03.314 --> 01:22:05.231
Yeah. I'm married to Avery.

2254
01:22:06.731 --> 01:22:08.856
-What, you don't believe in it?
-Oh...


2255
01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:12.231
Tracy did have the veil
with her when we met, but, uh...


2256
01:22:12.314 --> 01:22:13.398
I don't know,
maybe there's something to it.


2257
01:22:13.481 --> 01:22:14.523
Yeah.

2258
01:22:16.982 --> 01:22:18.356
We all agreed

2259
01:22:18.439 --> 01:22:21.147
that we wanted to return
this veil to your family.


2260
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:26.023
Oh...

2261
01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.565
Thank you.

2262
01:22:27.648 --> 01:22:31.189
So... it comes back
from my mother, Angela, to me...


2263
01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:36.565
...and from me to my daughter
and granddaughters.


2264
01:22:36.648 --> 01:22:37.898
Oh!

2265
01:22:37.982 --> 01:22:39.731
Thank you, Mom.

2266
01:22:42.565 --> 01:22:45.356
Well, if the legend
is really true,


2267
01:22:45.439 --> 01:22:48.189
then we'll all be dancing
at three more weddings.


2268
01:22:50.147 --> 01:22:51.523
Oh...

2269
01:22:55.314 --> 01:22:57.231
Ladies. Hey, hey.

2270
01:22:57.314 --> 01:22:58.565
I was just thinking.

2271
01:22:58.648 --> 01:23:00.273
We never talked about
where we want to go


2272
01:23:00.356 --> 01:23:01.856
on our spring reunion weekend.

2273
01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:04.690
What about going back
to San Francisco?


2274
01:23:04.773 --> 01:23:06.731
Full circle. It's perfect!

2275
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.147
I love that.

2276
01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:10.273
We can see what other treasures
we can find.


2277
01:23:10.356 --> 01:23:12.606
We don't need
any more treasures.


2278
01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:13.731
You know what?
You're right.


2279
01:23:13.815 --> 01:23:15.565
We have each other.

2280
01:23:16.982 --> 01:23:18.898
-To us.
-To us.


2281
01:23:20.106 --> 01:23:22.189
To us.
