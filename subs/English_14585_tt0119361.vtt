1
00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:07.740
So how do you feel?

2
00:02:07.808 --> 00:02:09.605
- It's okay.
- Yeah?


3
00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:12.578
- It's all right. Hurts a little.
- Where did she get you?


4
00:02:12.647 --> 00:02:14.080
Right here.

5
00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:16.644
There's no blood.

6
00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:19.242
- There's not a mark or anything.
- Still feel it.


7
00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:20.786
Sure.

8
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.090
- This is the point I made earlier.
- What?


9
00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.390
The '90s. Can't even afford to blink.
I miss too much.


10
00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:30.453
It's no big deal.

11
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:33.796
Howard, a woman hit you,
tagged you upside the head.


12
00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:36.029
- What'd you say to her?
- Nothing.


13
00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:39.368
- You said nothing.
- Asked her the time.


14
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.307
"What time is it?"
or "You got the time?"


15
00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:43.968
There's a crucial difference.

16
00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:46.775
I asked her what time it was.
You know, Mountain, Central.


17
00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:49.907
- You got a watch.
- I'm not kidding.


18
00:02:50.017 --> 00:02:55.284
You're telling me about some unprovoked
assault? That is uncalled-for.


19
00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:57.790
- Did she give you the time at least?
- No.


20
00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:02.558
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- Chad, it's not important.


21
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.258
Okay, well, we're doomed then.
Seriously.


22
00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:08.391
As a race.

23
00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.563
Men like us, guys who care about
the workplace, their women...


24
00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.698
We're doomed
if this is how they treat us.


25
00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:16.971
- What do you mean?
- We're sitting in a courtesy lounge...


26
00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:21.481
time passing us by, completely
at the whim of those bastards upstairs.


27
00:03:21.582 --> 00:03:24.551
- And now this.
- Ow. Yeah.


28
00:03:24.618 --> 00:03:27.553
Life is for the taking, is it not?

29
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.787
We're ten years out of university.
That's all... just ten.


30
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.522
I got a crop of these young dudes
after my desk.


31
00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:39.532
Taking jobs as production assistants.
The title didn't exist two years ago.


32
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.366
Just to hang out in the coffee room.
Vultures waiting for me to tire out.


33
00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:48.374
I get low numbers two months in a row?
They're gonna feed on my insides.


34
00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:50.774
- I'm no fool, okay?
- Of course not.


35
00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:00.583
- You guys okay?
- Looks like it.


36
00:04:00.654 --> 00:04:04.317
- No. Serious.
- It's kind of funny actually.


37
00:04:04.392 --> 00:04:06.326
Yeah? Don't doubt it.

38
00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:08.021
Big guy. Played ball, I hear.

39
00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:10.825
Probably bought everybody lunch
on Wednesday.


40
00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:12.991
Yeah, he did.

41
00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:16.935
That's all well and wonderful, and funny
stories about his girl in the sack?


42
00:04:17.004 --> 00:04:18.938
I bet he spins a good one.

43
00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:22.737
A year from now, he'll be asking you
to toss around ideas...


44
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.744
with some of the junior staff...

45
00:04:24.812 --> 00:04:29.715
and "Would you leave me the cruller?
It's the only doughnut I like".


46
00:04:29.817 --> 00:04:31.546
I'm telling you now.
Be careful.


47
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.824
What are you working on?

48
00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:40.292
Checking how "project director"
will look on your letterhead?


49
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.296
- Be nice.
- Forget it. I'm kidding you.


50
00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.967
- Watch this guy's ass.
- Sure.


51
00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:51.937
He's new and funny and a hell
of a shortstop, Fourth of July picnic...


52
00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:53.871
till the company
has a slight recession...


53
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:57.240
and he's bandying your name around
as somebody for the Phoenix office.


54
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:01.441
He's off collecting another wood-grained
plaque: "employee of the month".


55
00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:03.949
Right. I'll be careful.

56
00:05:04.018 --> 00:05:06.612
I'm telling you.
Watch your back.


57
00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:11.623
I've been seeing this girl
almost a year.


58
00:05:11.692 --> 00:05:15.719
What am I talking about? You met her.
That seafood joint maybe six months ago.


59
00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:18.424
- That little brunette? Melody?
- Melanie. Right.


60
00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.592
She was very cute, as I remember.

61
00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:24.195
Yeah. Took her home.
Met the folks.


62
00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:27.240
- Even gave her a ring one weekend.
- Seriously?


63
00:05:27.308 --> 00:05:30.471
- Yeah, I really liked her.
- Sounds like it.


64
00:05:30.544 --> 00:05:34.002
But then she starts
the "gotta see other people" setup...


65
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:36.345
and that whole routine.

66
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.385
Suddenly I'm parked in front
of her house 4:00 in the morning...


67
00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:41.444
going to work,
circles under my eyes.


68
00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:46.990
Call her three times before she calls me
back once. The phone-fade-out thing.


69
00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:50.053
Finally I say,
"This is not needed in my life".


70
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.963
Somebody rejects me,
you know, a woman?


71
00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:55.501
It drives me... Ah!
I hate it.


72
00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.799
- Yeah?
- Seems like everything...


73
00:05:57.872 --> 00:06:00.340
you know, work, these women...

74
00:06:00.407 --> 00:06:02.739
feel like they're
getting out of balance, don't they?


75
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.643
Yeah, they really do, Howard.

76
00:06:06.614 --> 00:06:08.775
We ought to do something about it.

77
00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:14.618
You know why I'm still chipper,
big grin on my face, Howie?


78
00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:16.121
Why is that?

79
00:06:19.326 --> 00:06:22.124
Because I realized something.

80
00:06:22.196 --> 00:06:25.097
I figured this out about a month ago.

81
00:06:25.165 --> 00:06:29.124
I came home, and Suzanne
had just packed up the joint.


82
00:06:29.203 --> 00:06:31.137
Yeah. She'd just gone.

83
00:06:32.406 --> 00:06:34.670
Really? You never...

84
00:06:34.742 --> 00:06:39.236
Left me a futon
and my poster of "American Gigolo".


85
00:06:39.313 --> 00:06:41.247
Bitch even took the frame off it.

86
00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:45.542
I'm standing there, no note...

87
00:06:45.653 --> 00:06:49.885
not a "thanks for four years of a roof
over my bleached-blonde head"...nothing.


88
00:06:49.957 --> 00:06:52.892
You know?
And it comes to me... the truth.


89
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.623
I do not give a shit,
not about anybody.


90
00:06:56.697 --> 00:06:59.723
A family member, a job, none of it.

91
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.392
I couldn't care less.

92
00:07:02.937 --> 00:07:04.370
Geez.

93
00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.097
- Don't get me wrong. We're pals.
- Same college.


94
00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:12.805
Exactly, and that means something.
But these other folks...


95
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.475
You know, jump on while
the going's good? No, that will not do.


96
00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:21.521
People. Goddamn Suzanne's probably
in Arizona riding dune buggies...


97
00:07:21.622 --> 00:07:23.556
not a care on this Earth.

98
00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:27.452
God, it makes me want
to fuck somebody up good.


99
00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:29.120
Sure. Geez.

100
00:07:30.698 --> 00:07:33.462
You know, if we were living in India...

101
00:07:33.534 --> 00:07:36.799
you could have burned your fiancĂ©e
on a pyre in the village square...


102
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.135
for even hinting at what she did to you,
to this day.


103
00:07:40.207 --> 00:07:41.868
I hear you.

104
00:07:43.544 --> 00:07:47.378
Circle the date on this one, big guy.
We keep playing along...


105
00:07:47.448 --> 00:07:51.942
with this "pick up the check,"
"can't a girl change her mind" crap...


106
00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:55.419
and we can't even tell a joke
in the workplace?


107
00:07:55.522 --> 00:07:58.457
There's going to be hell to pay
down the line, no doubt about it.


108
00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:02.560
We need to put our foot down.

109
00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:10.294
Never lose control.

110
00:08:11.472 --> 00:08:13.064
That's the key, Howard.

111
00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:17.643
That is the total key
to the universe.


112
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.913
Trust me.

113
00:08:23.517 --> 00:08:25.951
- Come on.
- I don't know.


114
00:08:29.056 --> 00:08:31.490
Do we look like frat boys to you?

115
00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:33.150
We need Scotch.

116
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.363
Listen.

117
00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:43.562
We're in town for six weeks, right?
I'm just talking, so jump in.


118
00:08:43.637 --> 00:08:47.368
This is perfect, what with
the breakup thing you got going too.


119
00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:50.376
Say we were to find some gal...

120
00:08:50.444 --> 00:08:54.278
and I know we got a shit load
of stuff to do...


121
00:08:54.348 --> 00:08:58.580
but I'm just saying, for the sake
of argument, we stumble onto something.


122
00:08:59.753 --> 00:09:03.416
This person's vulnerable as hell.

123
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.325
You know, young thing, wallflower type
or whatever. Disfigured in some way.


124
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.293
Some woman who is pretty sure
that life...


125
00:09:13.367 --> 00:09:17.963
and I mean a full, healthy sexual life,
romance, stuff like that...


126
00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:19.972
is lost to her forever.

127
00:09:30.718 --> 00:09:32.151
God bless you.

128
00:09:33.987 --> 00:09:36.251
Anyhow, we take a girl of that type...

129
00:09:36.323 --> 00:09:41.590
some corn-fed bitch who'd mess her pants
if you sharpen a pencil for her...


130
00:09:41.662 --> 00:09:43.596
and we both hit her.

131
00:09:44.565 --> 00:09:48.296
Small talk, a dinner date, flowers.

132
00:09:48.368 --> 00:09:51.462
No pushing it the first night out,
but it's like...


133
00:09:51.538 --> 00:09:55.599
taking her out, you know,
to see an ice show.


134
00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:57.371
Something like that.

135
00:09:57.444 --> 00:10:01.107
We just do it, you and me,
upping the ante all the time.


136
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:03.672
Suddenly, she's got two men.
She's calling her mom.


137
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:05.548
She's wearing makeup again.

138
00:10:05.652 --> 00:10:07.586
On we play,
and on and on.


139
00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:09.986
Then one day...

140
00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:13.823
out goes the rug
and us pulling it hard, and Jill...


141
00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:15.987
she just comes tumbling after.

142
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:19.258
Whoa.

143
00:10:20.067 --> 00:10:24.731
Hour later, we're on a flight back to
civilization like nothing ever happened.


144
00:10:24.805 --> 00:10:27.933
Trust me. She'll be reaching
for the sleeping pills within a week...


145
00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:31.341
and we will laugh about this
till we are very old men.


146
00:10:32.613 --> 00:10:34.205
What do you think?

147
00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:37.944
- Well, it's...
- Is that not ideal?


148
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:40.986
Restore a little dignity to our lives?

149
00:10:41.054 --> 00:10:45.047
The beauty is, for the next month
and a half, we can play ourselves off...


150
00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:47.093
as whoever we want to be.

151
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:49.527
Right. I mean, it sounds...

152
00:10:49.596 --> 00:10:52.064
I don't want to shock you.
It's just a thought.


153
00:10:52.132 --> 00:10:54.657
It's the same crap we played in school,
only better...


154
00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:59.104
because we get a payback on this messy
relationship shit we're dealing with.


155
00:10:59.173 --> 00:11:00.731
Think about it.

156
00:11:00.808 --> 00:11:04.073
No, right. I mean, it's funny.
It is.


157
00:11:04.144 --> 00:11:06.635
It's just way out there.

158
00:11:06.713 --> 00:11:09.477
Sure, and that's why
it's so perfect.


159
00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:12.074
This is all virgin territory.

160
00:11:12.186 --> 00:11:14.279
No matter what happens after it...

161
00:11:14.388 --> 00:11:17.551
jumped over for promotions,
wife runs off with some biochemist...


162
00:11:17.624 --> 00:11:19.251
who knows what...

163
00:11:19.326 --> 00:11:22.056
but we would always have this thing
to fall back on.


164
00:11:22.129 --> 00:11:26.828
We could always say, "Yeah, fine,
but they never got me like we got her".


165
00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:30.269
I think it would be refreshing...

166
00:11:30.337 --> 00:11:33.534
and very therapeutic
coming off the women we just have.


167
00:11:36.844 --> 00:11:41.781
Well, just for instance,
who would it be?


168
00:11:45.385 --> 00:11:46.818
No idea.

169
00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:53.217
She's out there... I know it...
just waiting for us to find her.


170
00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:01.634
What'd she say?

171
00:12:01.702 --> 00:12:04.830
"I don't trust anything that
bleeds for a week and doesn't die".


172
00:12:10.644 --> 00:12:12.077
So you in?

173
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.405
Oh, shit, man.

174
00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:17.449
Yeah, I'm in.

175
00:12:17.517 --> 00:12:19.508
All right. Then let's do it.

176
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.782
Let's hurt somebody.

177
00:12:44.811 --> 00:12:46.642
Hi. How are you?

178
00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:48.681
Listen. Excuse me.

179
00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:53.109
Jesus, what do I look like,
the sandwich guy? Excuse me.


180
00:12:55.355 --> 00:12:58.756
Must be the headphones. How do you work
with music? That would drive me batty.


181
00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:01.460
Anyway, I have this.

182
00:13:01.528 --> 00:13:05.624
Somebody pointed you out, said
you were good, and I need it by 2:00.


183
00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:10.636
If I'm not carrying this in my hand,

184
00:13:10.704 --> 00:13:13.605
I'll be sitting next to you tomorrow
borrowing your Wite-Out...


185
00:13:13.674 --> 00:13:16.802
and I don't type,
so, think you can do it?


186
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.446
Listen.
Throw a cover sheet on it.


187
00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:29.522
Grab one of those company folders
and shove it in the...


188
00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:31.022
Excuse me.

189
00:13:34.861 --> 00:13:37.386
What the hell?
Did I roll in something?


190
00:13:40.067 --> 00:13:43.400
No.
That's not it at all.


191
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.233
No, it's not.

192
00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:50.709
That's not the point I'm making.
No, it isn't. Don't tell me it is.


193
00:13:50.777 --> 00:13:54.838
I'm here, I'm talking with you right now
and I'm telling you no, so it's not.


194
00:13:57.684 --> 00:14:00.653
We're not getting anywhere here,
because it's not...


195
00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:04.623
and I'm not going to keep saying that
because I'm not.


196
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.390
This is a company line, I'm at work
and we're going in circles here.


197
00:14:12.632 --> 00:14:15.726
I suggest you talk directly with her.

198
00:14:15.802 --> 00:14:18.930
Mom, I said no.

199
00:14:20.107 --> 00:14:23.907
I don't care if she's been calling.
Doesn't mean I want to call her back.


200
00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:25.569
No, it doesn't.

201
00:14:27.781 --> 00:14:32.275
Tell her to stop bothering you, give me
a 25-cent call she wants to chat so bad.


202
00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:36.956
No, I can't call her.
Then I'd have to talk to her.


203
00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:41.426
Why do you think I don't want her new
number? So I don't have to be the one...


204
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.922
No, Mom. I...

205
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:50.661
She said that?

206
00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:54.373
Really. That bitch.

207
00:14:55.342 --> 00:14:58.004
No, I didn't say that.
I mean, I didn't...


208
00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:00.908
mean it.

209
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:03.313
All right. I'm sorry.
I know it's...


210
00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:06.443
Look, I gotta go.

211
00:15:06.553 --> 00:15:09.579
We won't be needing your help.
Thank you.


212
00:15:12.192 --> 00:15:14.922
Sales reps.
Aggressive little pricks.


213
00:15:26.506 --> 00:15:29.168
- Hey. John, right?
- Yeah. How's it going?


214
00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:30.675
- Fine.
- Good.


215
00:15:30.744 --> 00:15:35.340
- How are the digs upstairs?
- Shitty. I don't even have a desk.


216
00:15:35.415 --> 00:15:37.383
Got these fucking painters
wandering around.


217
00:15:37.451 --> 00:15:42.388
At least you've got a window. They had
a problem with the A.C. two weeks ago.


218
00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:44.822
Let's just say it's a touch rustic.

219
00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:48.987
Anyway, listen. What is the story
on that girl you sent me to?


220
00:15:49.062 --> 00:15:51.656
She's acting like I got shit
smeared on my tie.


221
00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:54.791
Sorry. I should have said something.
She's always like that.


222
00:15:54.868 --> 00:15:57.803
It's annoying as hell. Can't hold
a conversation for two minutes.


223
00:15:57.871 --> 00:16:01.363
What kind of feminist twaddle is that?
Who does she think she is, some goddess?


224
00:16:03.343 --> 00:16:04.776
Deaf.

225
00:16:09.549 --> 00:16:11.949
You're shitting me.

226
00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:13.576
What about the headphones?

227
00:16:13.687 --> 00:16:16.212
I don't know. Self-conscious, I guess.

228
00:16:16.323 --> 00:16:19.554
She pretty much keeps to herself,
times I see her.


229
00:16:20.393 --> 00:16:21.826
No shit.

230
00:16:22.762 --> 00:16:24.195
Thanks.

231
00:16:57.864 --> 00:16:59.297
Do I lie?

232
00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:02.130
What do you have to use
to get her attention, a dog whistle?


233
00:17:02.202 --> 00:17:05.433
No, reads lips. Nice girl.

234
00:17:05.505 --> 00:17:09.566
She's been here three weeks.
Placed by one of those agencies.


235
00:17:09.643 --> 00:17:11.235
Types 95 a minute.

236
00:17:11.311 --> 00:17:13.404
Super. She speak at all?

237
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.072
I've never heard her.

238
00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:19.351
I think she's got one of those voices.

239
00:17:19.419 --> 00:17:21.080
- You know, like...
- Like a dolphin.


240
00:17:24.357 --> 00:17:27.224
Like having a Sunday chat with Flipper.
That's what you're telling me?


241
00:17:27.294 --> 00:17:29.421
Something like that.

242
00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:31.464
Man, what a piece of work.

243
00:17:31.531 --> 00:17:33.795
She's kind of pretty though.

244
00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:35.732
Anyway...

245
00:17:35.802 --> 00:17:37.565
Anyway, thanks.

246
00:17:37.637 --> 00:17:39.867
See you later.

247
00:17:47.214 --> 00:17:48.806
This is great.

248
00:17:51.518 --> 00:17:55.010
About this morning. I was very rude.
I didn't even introduce myself.


249
00:17:55.121 --> 00:17:57.248
I'm Chad Piercewell.

250
00:17:57.324 --> 00:18:01.090
It's nice to meet you.
You're new here, aren't you?


251
00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:04.062
Don't be embarrassed.
We're all new sometime, right?


252
00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:07.931
That's a lovely blouse.

253
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.065
It's John Merrick. It's the only thing
I can think of the whole time.


254
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.665
I'm sitting across
from the fucking Elephant Man.


255
00:18:18.678 --> 00:18:21.010
She's attractive, though, right?

256
00:18:21.081 --> 00:18:23.641
Yeah, I guess.
I would say yeah.


257
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.617
- Tall?
- Kind of average...


258
00:18:26.686 --> 00:18:28.677
but you should see her going at it...

259
00:18:28.788 --> 00:18:31.279
working to put
the simplest sounds together.


260
00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:36.454
A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y is like
the Holy Grail to this poor wretch.


261
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:38.121
After about 15 minutes...

262
00:18:38.198 --> 00:18:41.133
I can't watch any more saliva
form in the corner of her mouth...


263
00:18:41.201 --> 00:18:43.499
or I'm gonna lose my taco salad.

264
00:18:45.038 --> 00:18:49.407
- But was she nice? I mean...
- Nice? Yeah.


265
00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:52.639
- Sweet, giving, all those things.
- That's good.


266
00:18:52.712 --> 00:18:55.909
One of the kindest people I've ever had
spray spit in my face.


267
00:19:00.954 --> 00:19:03.422
- Are you re-grouting in there?
- I'm coming.


268
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.048
Jesus.

269
00:19:05.158 --> 00:19:07.786
So, tell me. What else?

270
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:12.423
I get her entire family history jotted
down on a series of bar napkins...


271
00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:14.797
because finally,
I asked her to stop talking...


272
00:19:14.868 --> 00:19:16.961
because it would be easier to write.

273
00:19:17.037 --> 00:19:20.803
So now I'm reading these things
all night, playing 20 Questions.


274
00:19:20.874 --> 00:19:24.207
Family lived in Germany,
the air force.


275
00:19:24.277 --> 00:19:27.303
She lost her hearing
at eight or something like that.


276
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.372
She's got some sister
doing fieldwork, a Ph.D.


277
00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:35.086
I saw her picture.
Big horsey-looking bitch.


278
00:19:36.222 --> 00:19:38.520
Ask to see it
if you get the chance.

279
00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:41.986
Anyway, on and on. 
It was endless.

280
00:19:42.062 --> 00:19:44.394
Dinner?

281
00:19:44.464 --> 00:19:48.560
Yeah, we ate. Guess who doesn't reach
for her purse when the check comes.


282
00:19:49.869 --> 00:19:51.803
- Movie?
- No. Work night.


283
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:53.805
Besides, I'm starting out easy.

284
00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:57.101
- Kiss at the door?
- Naturally.


285
00:19:57.177 --> 00:19:59.111
- Nice.
- Just a peck.


286
00:20:00.647 --> 00:20:05.084
She's not bad-looking,
but you should see that mouth working...


287
00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:08.211
see those little bubbles
forming and popping.


288
00:20:08.321 --> 00:20:11.313
That's all it takes.
A kiss on the cheek was plenty.


289
00:20:14.027 --> 00:20:15.961
She is perfect for this.

290
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:19.294
- Yeah?
- Better than I expected.


291
00:20:19.366 --> 00:20:23.496
Wow. Hey, don't mean to check up on you
or anything...


292
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.197
but did you finish those files?

293
00:20:25.271 --> 00:20:28.206
They're on your desk.
Once you sign them, we're out of here.


294
00:20:28.274 --> 00:20:29.707
Great. Thanks.

295
00:20:33.413 --> 00:20:35.506
- I'm coming!
- Jesus.


296
00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:42.446
You're not pussing out on this, are you?

297
00:20:42.555 --> 00:20:44.489
No, I just don't know if she's...

298
00:20:44.557 --> 00:20:47.082
Good, because I'm not doing this
to find a mate, right?


299
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.424
- I thought we were in this together.
- We are.


300
00:20:49.496 --> 00:20:52.226
Okay then. It's not fun
unless we're both in on it.


301
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.568
Okay, I'll go down there
next week or something. I don't know.


302
00:20:57.637 --> 00:20:59.628
All right, give it a week.

303
00:20:59.706 --> 00:21:03.938
Look. This is not some broken-wing
blue jay we're talking about.


304
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.605
Catch her in a few of those
big, fat lies you like so much.


305
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.944
See how you feel about her then, okay?

306
00:21:12.385 --> 00:21:14.444
You guys doing anything this weekend?

307
00:21:14.554 --> 00:21:18.320
Yeah. Thought I'd take her
to a production of "The Miracle Worker".


308
00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:23.392
- What is that, a movie?
- Forget it.


309
00:21:23.463 --> 00:21:26.398
Are you coming out of there,
or should I have your calls forwarded?


310
00:21:26.466 --> 00:21:29.458
I'm coming. Oh, shit.

311
00:21:29.536 --> 00:21:31.128
I got it. Hurry up.

312
00:21:37.777 --> 00:21:39.210
Here you go.

313
00:21:44.551 --> 00:21:46.883
You think anyone's still at the office?

314
00:21:46.953 --> 00:21:48.386
Definitely.

315
00:21:51.591 --> 00:21:54.458
What's the difference between
a golf ball and a G-spot?


316
00:21:54.527 --> 00:21:55.960
I don't know.

317
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:59.123
I'll spend 20 minutes
looking for a golf ball.


318
00:21:59.199 --> 00:22:01.997
That's good. Yeah.

319
00:22:02.068 --> 00:22:05.037
- A guy downstairs told me that.
- Yeah, that's funny.


320
00:22:05.104 --> 00:22:07.868
I have to get these out
before it's too late.


321
00:22:07.941 --> 00:22:10.409
At least they could give us
some office equipment.


322
00:22:10.477 --> 00:22:13.002
No shit.
We're like Lewis and Clark up here.


323
00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:15.206
I'll buzz them,
let them know it's coming.


324
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:16.714
Thanks.

325
00:22:47.146 --> 00:22:50.138
Hello. I'm calling for Christine.
My name is Chad.


326
00:22:51.518 --> 00:22:53.008
Oh, you have?

327
00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:56.154
Well, thank you.

328
00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.724
No, I wouldn't think of it.

329
00:23:01.294 --> 00:23:05.287
No, ma'am. Just tell her everybody
is really sorry that she's down.


330
00:23:06.566 --> 00:23:09.729
I guess the flu's been
going through this place for weeks now.


331
00:23:16.476 --> 00:23:18.444
I hope she's up and around soon.

332
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:26.785
Did she get the flowers?

333
00:23:28.054 --> 00:23:29.487
Terrific.

334
00:23:31.524 --> 00:23:34.652
No, I just took up a little collection.
It's no big deal.


335
00:23:35.595 --> 00:23:37.028
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:23:40.533 --> 00:23:44.469
No, I'd rather not wake her.
Just tell her that I called?


337
00:23:47.774 --> 00:23:49.366
Okay, thanks again.

338
00:23:51.344 --> 00:23:53.039
I will. You too.

339
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.313
Okay, bye.

340
00:24:11.731 --> 00:24:16.691
All I mean is, I think everything's
a business, whatever you go into.


341
00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:21.172
Your typing there or my opportunity
directing this project.


342
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.708
Doesn't matter.
Every walk of life's an industry...


343
00:24:23.776 --> 00:24:25.710
from child care right on up.

344
00:24:25.778 --> 00:24:28.679
We need to take advantage
of the situation, right?


345
00:24:28.748 --> 00:24:30.841
That's what I think anyway.

346
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.909
You know, turn the situation
to our own advantage.


347
00:24:35.021 --> 00:24:38.388
So, on a personal level,
that's what I'm doing here.


348
00:24:38.458 --> 00:24:41.894
I was walking by, saw you,
figured, "What the hell," you know?


349
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:46.330
You probably have a boyfriend,
but you gotta take your chance, right?


350
00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:48.699
And who knows?

351
00:24:48.768 --> 00:24:51.737
It might turn out to be
mutually advantageous.


352
00:24:53.206 --> 00:24:56.903
So, that's really just
a long-winded way of saying...


353
00:24:56.976 --> 00:24:59.001
I'd like to go out sometime.

354
00:24:59.078 --> 00:25:01.103
Maybe get a drink?

355
00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:04.681
My name's Howard, by the way.

356
00:25:04.784 --> 00:25:07.218
I'm free this weekend.

357
00:25:10.089 --> 00:25:13.058
Hi. Howard, I need
to see you for a second.


358
00:25:14.327 --> 00:25:16.591
I'll be back in a minute.

359
00:25:17.497 --> 00:25:20.057
- What are you doing?
- That's not her.


360
00:25:20.133 --> 00:25:22.727
- What?
- That's not Christine.


361
00:25:22.802 --> 00:25:25.930
- You said the fourth room.
- She's not there. Come on.


362
00:25:26.005 --> 00:25:27.836
Let's go!

363
00:25:27.907 --> 00:25:30.671
- But I asked her out.
- Fuck her. Let's get a sandwich.


364
00:25:30.743 --> 00:25:32.176
Come on!

365
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.417
I got out of there
as fast as I could.

366
00:25:40.486 --> 00:25:44.684
As soon as I turned 18, I bolted,
far as I could get.


367
00:25:47.026 --> 00:25:50.484
My brothers...
I got two older brothers...


368
00:25:50.563 --> 00:25:54.499
they both got their union card
the day after graduation.


369
00:25:54.567 --> 00:25:56.159
Not me.

370
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.004
My dad couldn't see it.

371
00:25:59.072 --> 00:26:02.599
Thought it was the greatest thing.
Chrysler plant, Teamsters, all the rest.


372
00:26:02.675 --> 00:26:04.438
Couldn't get enough.

373
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.276
The whole Norman Rockwell thing.
Church, family, both parents...


374
00:26:08.347 --> 00:26:10.941
little place in the suburbs,
and you're in heaven, right?


375
00:26:12.752 --> 00:26:15.744
I was ready to apply to college
in ninth grade.


376
00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:20.751
They still think I'm crazy,
living in the city.


377
00:26:20.827 --> 00:26:23.955
Seriously. I just didn't want
any part of that.


378
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:28.524
So, comes this baseball scholarship.

379
00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:31.729
Yeah. Blew out my arm sophomore year.

380
00:26:32.872 --> 00:26:36.330
That's when I nabbed
the business degree.


381
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:39.936
Got into the biz,
and I like it.


382
00:26:41.314 --> 00:26:42.906
No big deal.

383
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.184
That's me, in a nutshell.

384
00:26:49.589 --> 00:26:52.490
So tell me about yourself.

385
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.151
Are you seeing anyone?

386
00:26:58.765 --> 00:27:00.790
Nobody?

387
00:27:03.603 --> 00:27:06.731
Just say it.
You speak fine.


388
00:27:07.673 --> 00:27:10.164
Really. It's okay.

389
00:27:18.518 --> 00:27:22.818
Well, I've lived in this town
for a few years now.


390
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.850
My family moved around a lot
when I was young.


391
00:27:30.263 --> 00:27:32.754
My father was in the military.

392
00:27:34.433 --> 00:27:39.166
He died of cancer, so we moved here...

393
00:27:39.238 --> 00:27:41.263
my mother and I.

394
00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:44.308
Her hometown.

395
00:27:46.646 --> 00:27:50.104
My sister lives in Seattle.

396
00:27:50.216 --> 00:27:52.150
She goes to school in Seattle.

397
00:27:56.923 --> 00:28:01.223
I don't know what else
you want to know about.


398
00:28:03.462 --> 00:28:06.226
A sister, huh? That's great.

399
00:28:08.668 --> 00:28:10.659
Do you have any pictures?

400
00:28:19.078 --> 00:28:20.670
I hate this guy.

401
00:28:21.414 --> 00:28:23.939
I hate that guy too.

402
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.109
He's a little bastard.
You ever met him?


403
00:28:26.219 --> 00:28:28.153
- No.
- Lucky you.


404
00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:31.990
Oh, I hate that dude right there.

405
00:28:33.526 --> 00:28:36.859
Craig or Greg?
One of those from Pittsburgh.


406
00:28:36.929 --> 00:28:38.521
He sucks dick.

407
00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.603
How's it going?

408
00:28:45.671 --> 00:28:48.435
- Good. I haven't seen you since...
- New Jersey, that one seminar.


409
00:28:48.507 --> 00:28:52.603
I heard they set you up here, so I...
Boy, this is nice.


410
00:28:52.678 --> 00:28:55.340
Yeah, you believe this shit?
When did they ship you out here?


411
00:28:55.414 --> 00:28:57.678
Ten days ago.
Training on the new DATCOM system.


412
00:28:57.783 --> 00:29:00.877
- Oh, great.
- I know her. Look at that face.


413
00:29:00.987 --> 00:29:02.716
- Cunt?
- Oh, yeah.


414
00:29:02.788 --> 00:29:05.416
Yeah, looks it.
Anyway...


415
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:08.790
You guys are here to finish
that Computech thing, right?


416
00:29:08.861 --> 00:29:11.159
- Yep. In and out, six weeks.
- Must be nice.


417
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.996
That guy you're with. What's his story?
I can't get a read on him yet.


418
00:29:15.067 --> 00:29:19.003
He's cool. It's just
his first time in charge, so, you know.


419
00:29:19.071 --> 00:29:21.335
- Seems okay.
- Yeah, it's no big deal.


420
00:29:21.407 --> 00:29:24.899
You guys take in
any of our nightlife yet?


421
00:29:24.977 --> 00:29:27.241
Yeah, we ate at Arby's yesterday.

422
00:29:28.481 --> 00:29:30.745
- Oh, man.
- What?


423
00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:35.378
I despise that dude. Sales rep from
Indiana? Major fucker. You remember him.


424
00:29:35.488 --> 00:29:38.286
Yeah. Laurence.
He was up there too.


425
00:29:38.357 --> 00:29:40.291
Exactly. Laurence.

426
00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:43.851
Now he is a new breed of fuck.

427
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.694
Like a special strain of fucker.

428
00:29:46.766 --> 00:29:48.825
I hate that prissy cocksucker.

429
00:29:48.901 --> 00:29:52.234
No kidding. You guys cover your ass
if he comes up here.


430
00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:53.772
Literally.

431
00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:56.205
- I gotta go. Catch you guys later.
- Good to see you.


432
00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:57.708
You too.

433
00:29:58.978 --> 00:30:00.775
- You like that guy?
- Him?


434
00:30:00.846 --> 00:30:03.406
- Yeah.
- You kidding me? I hate that prick.


435
00:30:26.272 --> 00:30:29.605
All right. So, break time's over.

436
00:30:29.675 --> 00:30:31.939
You're all fired.

437
00:30:32.011 --> 00:30:35.469
Kidding. It's good to have you guys
up from downstairs. Appreciate the help.


438
00:30:35.548 --> 00:30:40.008
Sorry about the conditions they got us
in here, repairing the water damage.


439
00:30:40.086 --> 00:30:42.554
Chad calls it...
You all met Chad, right?


440
00:30:42.655 --> 00:30:44.623
He calls it our Jonestown office.

441
00:30:45.992 --> 00:30:49.291
- It was funny when he said it.
- That's because I said "Jamestown".


442
00:30:49.362 --> 00:30:54.231
Right. Jamestown. So, anyway, this is
the biggest floor they could give us...


443
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.360
what with the computers
and everything we'll need.


444
00:30:57.436 --> 00:31:01.736
So we'll make do. Right. Let's see.
What's the best way to do this?


445
00:31:01.807 --> 00:31:04.537
Let's break into two teams.
We'll go one, two, one...


446
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.273
I thought you wanted to do
the projection thing.


447
00:31:08.347 --> 00:31:11.316
Right. Who's got those graphs?

448
00:31:12.852 --> 00:31:14.877
Let's take a look at them.

449
00:31:14.987 --> 00:31:17.046
- It's not serious.
- Yeah?


450
00:31:17.156 --> 00:31:20.592
- Nah, just seeing her, you know.
- Right.


451
00:31:20.693 --> 00:31:23.423
- Took her to lunch a couple of times.
- Yeah.


452
00:31:23.496 --> 00:31:26.431
I see your pal down at her desk
every other day.


453
00:31:26.499 --> 00:31:30.401
Heard he went to the movies with her.
Come on. Something's going on.


454
00:31:30.469 --> 00:31:33.836
What? It's mostly work.
She does some typing for us.


455
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.204
We both took her out.
It's no big deal.


456
00:31:37.276 --> 00:31:39.073
- Sure.
- It's not.


457
00:31:39.145 --> 00:31:41.978
- All right. It's not my business.
- Right.


458
00:31:44.216 --> 00:31:48.016
Listen. I know it probably... But
I'm telling you the truth. It's nothing.


459
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:51.280
- Just a coincidence.
- Okay.


460
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.951
- She's a nice girl.
- Hey, my hat's off to you.


461
00:31:55.027 --> 00:31:56.995
Bigger man than I am.

462
00:31:58.864 --> 00:32:01.662
You don't think she's cute?

463
00:32:01.734 --> 00:32:04.328
- Yeah.
- Serious. Got a nice figure.


464
00:32:04.403 --> 00:32:06.371
- Absolutely.
- But?


465
00:32:08.007 --> 00:32:11.135
You wouldn't be caught dead with her,
right?


466
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.340
In a company like this,
with these guys around?


467
00:32:15.414 --> 00:32:16.938
No fucking way.

468
00:32:42.575 --> 00:32:44.236
Hello? Yes, hi.

469
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.244
Is Christine home yet?

470
00:32:47.346 --> 00:32:51.043
No. Fine. I see.
No, no message.


471
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:54.249
Is this one of those phones?

472
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.952
I mean, is there a readout for her?
How does that...


473
00:33:00.025 --> 00:33:02.493
I'm sorry. Obviously, it doesn't matter.
I'm talking with you.


474
00:33:02.561 --> 00:33:05.496
I could just tell you, couldn't I?
I'm just curious.


475
00:33:07.066 --> 00:33:10.467
Oh, it is one. Okay. Thanks.
Well, just tell her...


476
00:33:13.973 --> 00:33:18.569
Sorry. It's sort of an office thing.
Someone retiring.


477
00:33:18.644 --> 00:33:20.339
I don't even know who.

478
00:33:20.412 --> 00:33:23.870
Can you hold on a sec?
I'll be right back.


479
00:33:25.117 --> 00:33:27.244
Hello? What?

480
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.279
No, I checked those myself
before I had them sent out.


481
00:33:32.391 --> 00:33:35.155
It was a nice suggestion,
coming out here.


482
00:33:35.227 --> 00:33:37.388
I didn't even know this was up here.

483
00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:44.697
Thanks for showing me this, Christine.

484
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.203
You're welcome.

485
00:33:51.844 --> 00:33:55.837
And you got me out of going to some
guy's farewell party. I appreciate it.


486
00:34:00.719 --> 00:34:04.587
Just check around and call me back.
I'm sure they're there.


487
00:34:05.558 --> 00:34:07.549
Just check around. Okay.

488
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:12.922
Hello? I'm sorry.

489
00:34:12.998 --> 00:34:17.367
Anyway, I tried to catch her before
she left, and I couldn't find her.


490
00:34:17.436 --> 00:34:20.303
No, it's no big deal.
No, it's...


491
00:34:23.676 --> 00:34:25.610
Well, it's nice to talk with you.

492
00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:30.138
No, my name's Howard.

493
00:34:30.249 --> 00:34:32.513
That's all right.

494
00:34:32.618 --> 00:34:35.712
I just wanted to touch base
on a couple of office things.


495
00:34:35.821 --> 00:34:37.288
No big deal.

496
00:34:38.824 --> 00:34:40.416
No, no message.

497
00:34:42.194 --> 00:34:43.627
That's fine.

498
00:34:45.064 --> 00:34:46.497
Good night.

499
00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:53.336
So do you...

500
00:34:53.405 --> 00:34:55.532
I don't mean to embarrass you, but...

501
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.841
Forget it.

502
00:34:59.912 --> 00:35:02.437
No, it's okay. Really.

503
00:35:05.184 --> 00:35:09.211
I was thinking about the drive-in
you took me to last week.


504
00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:11.255
- You know, the movie?
- Yes.


505
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.794
When I pulled in,
I put the speaker on my side.


506
00:35:18.864 --> 00:35:21.128
I assumed you wouldn't need it
because of...


507
00:35:22.801 --> 00:35:24.735
- Am I making any sense?
- Yes.


508
00:35:24.803 --> 00:35:27.294
- No, I'm not. I sound like an idiot.
- No.


509
00:35:29.675 --> 00:35:33.805
- Should I have put the thing on...
- No, it was fine.


510
00:35:33.879 --> 00:35:35.312
You sure?

511
00:35:37.082 --> 00:35:40.916
So how do you...
Do you feel the sound or...


512
00:35:43.055 --> 00:35:44.989
Forget it. I'm sorry.

513
00:35:45.057 --> 00:35:48.185
No. People are curious.
It's okay.


514
00:35:49.194 --> 00:35:52.288
I've seen most of the movies on TV.

515
00:35:52.364 --> 00:35:54.662
I read their lips.

516
00:35:54.733 --> 00:35:57.702
It helps that their mouths
are 50 feet tall.


517
00:36:04.076 --> 00:36:05.509
That's terrific.

518
00:36:06.612 --> 00:36:08.603
I'm sorry for asking.

519
00:36:09.682 --> 00:36:11.115
It's okay.

520
00:36:39.345 --> 00:36:42.143
- Try and get corned beef in this place.
- Right.


521
00:36:43.215 --> 00:36:46.946
Can't stay long. Everyone else
ordered in. Stuff's piling up up there.


522
00:36:47.052 --> 00:36:48.644
- You guys busy?
- God, yeah.


523
00:36:48.754 --> 00:36:52.087
- I was working on the presentation.
- You're not going to believe this.


524
00:36:52.157 --> 00:36:54.489
- You know that new dude?
- Which?


525
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.326
That guy, Mr. MBA, back home.
He screwed up already, big time.


526
00:36:58.397 --> 00:37:01.161
- Watch him. I told you.
- Right?


527
00:37:01.233 --> 00:37:05.067
All that material you faxed to him
last week? Suddenly, he can't find it.


528
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:08.064
- You're kidding me.
- Nope.


529
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.234
- Found like two pages or something.
- Oh, shit.


530
00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.245
I put the receive notice
on the clipboard. You can check.


531
00:37:14.313 --> 00:37:17.043
I know you did.
Can you hand me a napkin?


532
00:37:17.149 --> 00:37:20.277
- Just makes us look bad.
- He's the one who screwed up.


533
00:37:20.386 --> 00:37:24.117
He didn't notice at first.
Now he's tearing up the office.


534
00:37:24.189 --> 00:37:26.123
- Serves him right.
- Yeah, but I'm the one...


535
00:37:26.191 --> 00:37:28.716
with my thing hanging out my pants
come Monday morning.


536
00:37:28.794 --> 00:37:31.729
Hard copy's still on my desk,
everyone asking why.


537
00:37:32.831 --> 00:37:35.095
I should have "next-dayed" a disk.

538
00:37:35.167 --> 00:37:39.160
- I did suggest that.
- I know. My fault.


539
00:37:41.006 --> 00:37:45.067
We'll get it out today. No big deal,
just not what I planned.


540
00:37:49.014 --> 00:37:50.447
So.

541
00:37:51.216 --> 00:37:52.706
How's Christine?

542
00:37:52.818 --> 00:37:54.342
- She's good.
- Yeah?


543
00:37:54.453 --> 00:37:56.387
Oh, yeah. You?

544
00:37:56.455 --> 00:37:58.889
Fine. Sent her flowers.

545
00:38:00.592 --> 00:38:03.584
Yeah?
That's funny. Me too.


546
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.595
I'm not picking out china patterns
or looking for our dream cottage...


547
00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:10.692
but it's good.

548
00:38:11.837 --> 00:38:14.328
It's a lot of fun, actually.

549
00:38:14.406 --> 00:38:15.998
I think so too.

550
00:38:19.178 --> 00:38:21.646
So you're liking her better then.

551
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:24.539
I don't know. Better?

552
00:38:26.452 --> 00:38:29.478
I'm not sure.
It's just that every so often...


553
00:38:29.588 --> 00:38:32.318
I'll look over there and think...

554
00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:35.519
"You know, I could almost
see myself with this person".


555
00:38:35.594 --> 00:38:40.531
I mean, not when she's talking. Then you
just want to slip down a side street...


556
00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:45.059
hope no one heard her swallowing
her tongue trying to get a sentence out.


557
00:38:45.137 --> 00:38:48.368
But a couple of times...
Maybe it's this look she gives me...


558
00:38:50.576 --> 00:38:54.910
or this feeling shoots up the nerve
endings as she touches my arm.


559
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.572
Just squeezes it.

560
00:38:58.417 --> 00:39:01.181
I mean, we're sharing a Slurpee,
for God's sake.


561
00:39:01.286 --> 00:39:05.052
I don't know.
I look at her, moments like that...


562
00:39:05.123 --> 00:39:09.787
and I can see, you know,
kids and Volvo in the garage...


563
00:39:09.862 --> 00:39:11.955
all that crap in-between.

564
00:39:13.899 --> 00:39:17.528
- She's definitely got something.
- Serious? I mean, that's...


565
00:39:17.603 --> 00:39:20.868
I don't mean exactly that,
but, hell, I don't know.


566
00:39:20.939 --> 00:39:23.908
You've been out with her.
You get that at all?


567
00:39:23.976 --> 00:39:25.568
Just every so often.

568
00:39:26.645 --> 00:39:29.079
- You?
- Sure, kind of.


569
00:39:33.385 --> 00:39:35.182
Really?

570
00:39:35.254 --> 00:39:40.191
Well, I mean, yeah.
She's kind of nice, you know?


571
00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:41.692
I know.

572
00:39:42.961 --> 00:39:44.895
It's an odd twist, all considered.

573
00:39:44.963 --> 00:39:46.726
That's true.

574
00:39:46.798 --> 00:39:48.891
Yeah, just see how it goes, I guess.

575
00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:50.901
Yeah.

576
00:39:50.969 --> 00:39:54.405
It's a serpentine road
we travel this life.


577
00:39:54.473 --> 00:39:56.907
- See where it takes us.
- Okay.


578
00:40:00.379 --> 00:40:03.542
- Sandwich any good?
- It's okay.


579
00:40:03.615 --> 00:40:05.708
They kind of screw you on the meat.

580
00:40:06.985 --> 00:40:08.543
Yep, they sure do.

581
00:40:18.196 --> 00:40:21.256
I thought you said this friend of yours
was a good guy.


582
00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:24.131
- He is.
- Then why is he sending me to Bozeman?


583
00:40:24.202 --> 00:40:25.635
Montana?

584
00:40:25.704 --> 00:40:28.901
Fourth of July weekend
and I'm going to Big Sky Country.


585
00:40:28.974 --> 00:40:31.704
Some convention he wants me
to coordinate the booth for.


586
00:40:31.777 --> 00:40:33.210
Ouch.

587
00:40:33.278 --> 00:40:36.042
- This really stinks. I had plans.
- So tell him.


588
00:40:36.114 --> 00:40:38.674
I already e-mailed him.
He sent me back that.


589
00:40:38.784 --> 00:40:41.275
Some high nova, system-best crap. Shit!

590
00:40:41.386 --> 00:40:44.184
What can I tell you? 
Power corrupts.

591
00:40:44.256 --> 00:40:47.953
The real injustice here
is if I could throw a curveball...


592
00:40:48.026 --> 00:40:50.017
you know, a really good one...

593
00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:54.191
just that, nothing else, no education,
nothing... none of this would matter.


594
00:40:54.266 --> 00:40:58.293
Play in the big leagues for ten years,
retire to Oahu.


595
00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.304
Yeah? Life sucks, huh?

596
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.473
Listen.

597
00:41:06.211 --> 00:41:07.644
Have fun.

598
00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:15.415
Hey. Sorry.

599
00:41:15.487 --> 00:41:18.183
I got held up
just as I was leaving.

600
00:41:18.256 --> 00:41:23.193
We missed a deadline. I had to ream out
a couple of guys who were responsible.


601
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:26.196
Sorry. "Ream"?

602
00:41:26.264 --> 00:41:28.494
"Ream" ...chew out.

603
00:41:30.202 --> 00:41:32.136
Yell.

604
00:41:32.204 --> 00:41:36.800
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. It all worked out.


605
00:41:36.875 --> 00:41:40.777
- Anyway...
- No, I meant for the men.


606
00:41:40.846 --> 00:41:45.806
I'm sorry they made a mistake.
I know your project is very important.


607
00:41:45.884 --> 00:41:48.444
They must have felt terrible.

608
00:41:48.553 --> 00:41:51.021
Yeah. I mean no.

609
00:41:51.089 --> 00:41:53.023
It was no big deal.

610
00:41:53.125 --> 00:41:57.824
I just explained the error to them...

611
00:41:57.896 --> 00:42:00.922
but it held me up a bit.

612
00:42:01.967 --> 00:42:04.094
Oh, that's okay.

613
00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:05.602
Thanks.

614
00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:11.800
This is nice.

615
00:42:13.945 --> 00:42:16.175
Hey. This is really nice.

616
00:42:16.248 --> 00:42:19.877
I mean for a place like this...
a city this size.


617
00:42:19.985 --> 00:42:24.388
Yes. I like it a lot.
It's so quiet.


618
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:27.824
Right.

619
00:42:29.628 --> 00:42:31.061
So that must...

620
00:42:32.964 --> 00:42:36.422
- Look. I'm sorry.
- About what?


621
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:38.833
What I did just then.

622
00:42:38.904 --> 00:42:42.362
Coming in with
the "I'm so busy" crap.


623
00:42:43.275 --> 00:42:45.607
So you're not busy?

624
00:42:45.677 --> 00:42:48.908
Well, no. I mean, yes, I am,
but I wasn't.


625
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.610
I... I made that up.

626
00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:55.653
About disciplining those two guys?

627
00:42:55.721 --> 00:42:59.350
I just made that up
instead of telling the truth.


628
00:42:59.424 --> 00:43:01.756
I ran back to the hotel
to change my shirt.


629
00:43:01.827 --> 00:43:04.625
I wanted to look good,
so I was late.


630
00:43:06.932 --> 00:43:10.959
- That's okay.
- No, it's not all right.


631
00:43:12.504 --> 00:43:15.701
I get so used to saying
what I think people want to hear...


632
00:43:15.774 --> 00:43:19.540
I forget they might
just want the truth sometimes.


633
00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:23.103
- So I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Really.


634
00:43:24.216 --> 00:43:27.481
- Forgive me?
- Of course.


635
00:43:27.586 --> 00:43:31.522
Just remember:
I can't hear you when you're lying.


636
00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:34.615
Sure.

637
00:43:34.726 --> 00:43:37.752
- Send a note.
- Oh, right.


638
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.594
- That's good advice. Thank you.
- You're welcome.


639
00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:50.271
- You look good.
- No.


640
00:43:50.342 --> 00:43:51.969
Oh, you're blushing.

641
00:43:53.578 --> 00:43:56.672
I'm glad you made it, late or not.

642
00:43:59.351 --> 00:44:04.414
Oh, look.
They are so beautiful, aren't they?


643
00:44:04.523 --> 00:44:05.956
Yeah.

644
00:44:19.337 --> 00:44:24.206
Okay, because we'd like a table
facing the water. That's what we want.


645
00:44:24.276 --> 00:44:28.576
I see it in the brochure you sent.
That's what we'd really like.


646
00:44:30.415 --> 00:44:32.007
Thanks.

647
00:44:32.117 --> 00:44:34.108
Oh. I had an idea.

648
00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:39.521
If we download the vertical commands,
I think we can bypass...


649
00:44:39.591 --> 00:44:42.719
You know what? Have them hold on
ten minutes. I'll be down to explain it.


650
00:44:43.795 --> 00:44:45.524
I'm sorry.

651
00:44:45.597 --> 00:44:48.259
We're thinking of getting in
an early dinner.


652
00:44:48.333 --> 00:44:50.961
3:30, 4:00, something like that.
Whatever you've got.


653
00:44:52.037 --> 00:44:54.301
I need those Tuesday.

654
00:44:54.372 --> 00:44:59.674
No, the reservations are for the fourth.
Can you hold on?


655
00:44:59.744 --> 00:45:03.441
Instructions on the product.
Okay. I gotta take this.


656
00:45:06.117 --> 00:45:07.550
Excuse me.

657
00:45:10.255 --> 00:45:13.816
I know it's just a lake,
but the view this time of year...


658
00:45:13.892 --> 00:45:16.190
it's pretty stunning, isn't it?

659
00:45:19.764 --> 00:45:23.791
That's fine. You have my card number,
right? You can send me confirmation?


660
00:45:23.869 --> 00:45:28.033
I gotta go. Okay, thanks.

661
00:45:28.106 --> 00:45:32.440
Hey. It looks like we can go up
a week from Saturday.


662
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.535
I mean, if you still want to.

663
00:45:34.613 --> 00:45:38.777
I asked around. It's supposed to be one
of the nicest restaurants in the area.


664
00:45:40.318 --> 00:45:43.845
Well, yes, probably.

665
00:45:44.789 --> 00:45:47.656
I just have to check...

666
00:45:47.726 --> 00:45:49.318
I think so.

667
00:45:50.528 --> 00:45:52.257
I should get back.

668
00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:57.267
Hey, do you want to grab some lunch?
I mean, only if you want to.


669
00:45:57.335 --> 00:46:00.395
There's a couple of things
I'd like to talk to you about.


670
00:46:00.472 --> 00:46:04.169
Well, could we do
it later in the week?

671
00:46:04.242 --> 00:46:08.576
Today's bad. Lots of reports due.
End of the month, you know.


672
00:46:08.647 --> 00:46:11.741
Sure. No, just taking a shot, you know.

673
00:46:15.487 --> 00:46:18.047
That's a beautiful dress.

674
00:46:19.824 --> 00:46:22.292
You look good.

675
00:46:25.764 --> 00:46:27.197
Thank you.

676
00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:31.794
I mean, that's a nice style for you.

677
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:36.603
Probably sounds goofy coming from a guy
like me, but I can tell these things.


678
00:46:36.675 --> 00:46:38.267
I really can.

679
00:46:51.523 --> 00:46:53.548
You look good.

680
00:47:02.801 --> 00:47:05.565
- Everything okay?
- Yes.


681
00:47:05.637 --> 00:47:09.334
This place has great barbecue,
supposedly. Some of the best in town.


682
00:47:09.407 --> 00:47:10.840
Yes, it does.

683
00:47:23.388 --> 00:47:25.356
Hey, look.

684
00:47:25.457 --> 00:47:29.393
The reason I wanted to have lunch is
I wanted to speak to you about us.


685
00:47:29.461 --> 00:47:31.395
I just want to talk, you know?

686
00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:38.702
I need to say this,
get everything out in the open.


687
00:47:43.775 --> 00:47:46.141
I hate this part of dating.
It's always hard...


688
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:49.476
when you start to feel something
for a person...


689
00:47:49.547 --> 00:47:52.345
begin to feel like
taking that next step.


690
00:47:53.551 --> 00:47:55.849
You see what I'm trying to say?

691
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.854
- My cards are on the table.
- Yes.


692
00:48:00.291 --> 00:48:02.521
You are so beautiful.

693
00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:13.963
I have to face this.
My job ends here in a few weeks, and...


694
00:48:14.939 --> 00:48:18.500
I want you to know that whatever you do
is all right with me.


695
00:48:18.576 --> 00:48:20.703
I don't care
about your dating other guys...


696
00:48:20.779 --> 00:48:24.010
and if we're apart for a while or...

697
00:48:27.252 --> 00:48:29.584
Well, I just want you to know that...

698
00:48:31.456 --> 00:48:34.857
whatever happens, I trust you.

699
00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.753
Okay?

700
00:48:39.064 --> 00:48:41.259
Oh, boy, this is really hard.

701
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.103
I like you.

702
00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:52.301
There, I said it. It's out.
I'll eat better now.


703
00:48:52.377 --> 00:48:54.038
It's true.

704
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.273
I look at you, and I see...

705
00:48:59.417 --> 00:49:01.442
good, nice, kind.

706
00:49:02.987 --> 00:49:05.512
I am very happy with you...

707
00:49:05.623 --> 00:49:09.650
and I want our relationship...

708
00:49:09.727 --> 00:49:11.661
You feel this could be
a relationship...


709
00:49:11.729 --> 00:49:13.162
right?

710
00:49:15.934 --> 00:49:19.563
I want to nurture it
and just see us blossom.


711
00:49:26.811 --> 00:49:28.938
That's what I wanted to say, so...

712
00:49:30.782 --> 00:49:35.048
let's just enjoy this, and I'm really
in the mood for some ribs.


713
00:49:44.062 --> 00:49:45.495
How are you?

714
00:49:46.965 --> 00:49:49.593
Chris, you know Howard at all?

715
00:49:49.667 --> 00:49:52.158
I've seen her around. Hi.

716
00:49:52.237 --> 00:49:55.035
Howard's in charge
of the project I work on.


717
00:49:57.876 --> 00:50:01.073
- Christine's a secretary on three.
- Oh, is that right?


718
00:50:01.146 --> 00:50:03.080
Yeah. This is hilarious.

719
00:50:03.148 --> 00:50:08.484
Suddenly I see you everywhere.
I mean, you know how this is, Christine.


720
00:50:08.553 --> 00:50:11.647
Howard and I have the same alma mater.

721
00:50:11.756 --> 00:50:14.156
He graduates a semester ahead of me,
and now he's my boss.


722
00:50:14.225 --> 00:50:17.422
- Just on this one project.
- Come on now.


723
00:50:17.495 --> 00:50:20.794
Don't be modest. They picked you
over me or anybody else. You're it.


724
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.492
- You got time to sit?
- No, I can't.


725
00:50:26.938 --> 00:50:29.839
I gotta get upstairs.
Lot of reports due.


726
00:50:29.908 --> 00:50:32.342
End of the month, you know.

727
00:50:34.078 --> 00:50:35.670
That's too bad.

728
00:50:39.684 --> 00:50:41.117
Oh, shoot.

729
00:50:42.754 --> 00:50:46.417
I gotta take this. I'm sorry.
Excuse me? I'll be right back.


730
00:50:51.729 --> 00:50:53.128
I'm so sorry.

731
00:50:54.832 --> 00:50:56.766
It's okay.

732
00:50:56.834 --> 00:50:59.735
You must really like this place.

733
00:51:00.638 --> 00:51:04.301
No. He had already made plans.

734
00:51:04.375 --> 00:51:05.967
It's no big deal.

735
00:51:07.412 --> 00:51:08.845
I should...

736
00:51:11.516 --> 00:51:15.509
Forgive me. I still...

737
00:51:16.421 --> 00:51:17.854
It's okay.

738
00:51:28.199 --> 00:51:30.633
Where'd Howard go?

739
00:51:30.702 --> 00:51:32.636
He said he had to go.

740
00:51:33.972 --> 00:51:38.204
Do you two...
I mean, you work together.


741
00:51:38.276 --> 00:51:42.508
Yeah. I do most of the marketing.
Howard coordinates all the divisions.


742
00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:46.812
You knew that, right? There's six of us
brought in from all over for this thing.


743
00:51:46.918 --> 00:51:52.190
No. So many people come and go,
I didn't know.


744
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:54.351
It's no big deal.
You do now.


745
00:51:55.293 --> 00:51:57.659
He's a nice guy though.

746
00:51:57.729 --> 00:52:02.325
He's a hell of a guy,
a truly decent person, I think.


747
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.561
Seriously, you should
talk to him sometime.


748
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:08.737
Yeah. I always liked Howard.

749
00:52:08.806 --> 00:52:11.900
Anyway, you want to get an appetizer?
That be all right?


750
00:52:11.976 --> 00:52:14.069
I'm so hungry, 
I could eat forever.

751
00:52:22.954 --> 00:52:25.616
That break room down there
is an absolute cesspool.


752
00:52:26.491 --> 00:52:28.550
Coming out of there...

753
00:52:28.626 --> 00:52:30.560
you were already in the restroom...

754
00:52:30.628 --> 00:52:34.997
I see three interns slinking around
like it's summer camp or a food fight.


755
00:52:35.066 --> 00:52:38.866
It pisses me off.
Then they drag their shit upstairs too.


756
00:52:38.936 --> 00:52:40.904
Yeah. I'll say something to them.

757
00:52:40.972 --> 00:52:43.873
God, it's a great view up here.
How did you find this place?


758
00:52:45.009 --> 00:52:47.739
What's-her-name. Christine.

759
00:52:47.812 --> 00:52:50.975
Juvenile fuckers,
leaving a place looking like that.


760
00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:53.950
Working in a company of men,
and they still want their mommies...


761
00:52:54.018 --> 00:52:56.145
wiping their bottoms
every time they go potty.


762
00:52:56.254 --> 00:52:59.246
- We've got two trash cans down there.
- Exactly.


763
00:52:59.357 --> 00:53:02.121
Boy, that makes me want to...
I don't know.


764
00:53:02.193 --> 00:53:04.923
- When did you two come up here?
- We ought to set an example.


765
00:53:06.264 --> 00:53:10.496
Yeah, you're right.
Ah, I got too much to do as it is.


766
00:53:11.936 --> 00:53:16.202
I know that. I'm saying in theory,
something should be done.


767
00:53:16.274 --> 00:53:19.209
Back home, the place
would not look like that...


768
00:53:19.277 --> 00:53:21.768
and they should be taught that.

769
00:53:26.818 --> 00:53:29.753
- I'm just venting. It's no big deal.
- Sure.


770
00:53:31.522 --> 00:53:34.252
- So, how things going?
- Okay. I'm busy.


771
00:53:34.325 --> 00:53:36.657
- Yeah?
- Yeah, customers, you know.


772
00:53:36.728 --> 00:53:40.687
- I'm hitting my deadlines, though.
- Hey, appreciate that.


773
00:53:40.765 --> 00:53:44.667
Love to have this whole thing in place
by the holiday.


774
00:53:44.736 --> 00:53:50.265
I know this is last-minute, but maybe
you could fly back over the break...


775
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:52.935
deliver the stuff,
make the presentation.


776
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:57.379
I mean, if it's all right.
They want to know what we've been doing.


777
00:53:57.482 --> 00:54:02.249
- I thought you were set to go back.
- I was, but I got stuff piling up.


778
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.254
Like what? It's the weekend.

779
00:54:04.322 --> 00:54:05.755
Well, things.

780
00:54:05.823 --> 00:54:08.587
Why don't you send John?
He's up to speed on it.


781
00:54:08.659 --> 00:54:13.596
I was going to, but he doesn't know
the city or the players back there.


782
00:54:13.664 --> 00:54:18.601
I think you could sell the changes
we implemented in the package.


783
00:54:18.669 --> 00:54:21.263
I mean, if you're okay with that.

784
00:54:22.974 --> 00:54:24.908
- If you're not...
- Sure. I'm salary.


785
00:54:24.976 --> 00:54:29.106
There are no holidays. Leave it
on your desk. I'll get it Friday.


786
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.411
Terrific. I'll keep an eye on things
on this end.


787
00:54:32.517 --> 00:54:36.510
We'll get together on Monday,
review it all. Appreciate it.


788
00:54:36.621 --> 00:54:40.614
I was thinking about taking Christine
to a ball game or something. Fireworks.


789
00:54:40.725 --> 00:54:43.853
- A town like this must eat that up.
- Yeah. Sorry about that.


790
00:54:43.928 --> 00:54:46.488
You know, work comes first.

791
00:54:46.564 --> 00:54:49.032
You think of something, okay?
Keep the heat on.


792
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:53.628
- I'll try. I'll probably be swamped.
- Yeah, with things.


793
00:54:53.704 --> 00:54:56.832
Whatever. We still got a little while
before the big finale.


794
00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:03.278
Listen, about lunch last week.
I had no idea that you made plans.


795
00:55:03.347 --> 00:55:05.611
- You did, right? That look on your face.
- No problem.


796
00:55:05.716 --> 00:55:08.344
- Seriously. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.


797
00:55:08.453 --> 00:55:11.889
She hadn't told you about it, though,
had she?


798
00:55:11.956 --> 00:55:13.583
I didn't think so.

799
00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:19.029
We should be careful, though,
now that she's seen us.


800
00:55:19.096 --> 00:55:23.396
You know what I mean?
Maybe one of us should pull back.


801
00:55:24.502 --> 00:55:26.094
Yeah, maybe so.

802
00:55:27.371 --> 00:55:29.532
- Who should it be?
- Oh, whoever.


803
00:55:29.607 --> 00:55:33.543
I just don't want to be too obvious.

804
00:55:33.611 --> 00:55:35.545
Absolutely. Or get caught.

805
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:39.777
Things okay, though?
You're not second-guessing or anything.


806
00:55:39.884 --> 00:55:41.852
- No, no, no. I'm still...
- Good.


807
00:55:44.322 --> 00:55:46.756
- You?
- Yeah.


808
00:55:50.461 --> 00:55:53.328
You ever hear from
that one girl of yours again?


809
00:55:53.397 --> 00:55:55.160
- Oh, yeah.
- No kidding.


810
00:55:55.233 --> 00:55:58.828
- Yep. Calling my mom.
- Ouch.


811
00:55:58.903 --> 00:56:03.101
And I'm getting these messages
on my machine. Nobody says anything.


812
00:56:03.174 --> 00:56:06.837
She doesn't have the decency
to call me direct. It pisses me off.


813
00:56:06.911 --> 00:56:09.345
- Give 'em a chance, buy her a ring...
- That bitch.


814
00:56:09.413 --> 00:56:11.608
Back they come,
too late, huh?


815
00:56:12.917 --> 00:56:14.851
Calling my mother? I mean...

816
00:56:16.354 --> 00:56:18.652
I see where you
got a message last week.

817
00:56:18.723 --> 00:56:20.657
- What?
- From Suzanne.


818
00:56:21.726 --> 00:56:24.058
Oh, yeah. You believe that?

819
00:56:24.128 --> 00:56:26.858
I wasn't snooping.
I saw it on your terminal.


820
00:56:26.931 --> 00:56:30.958
She never called back again.
See, that's what I'm talking about.


821
00:56:31.035 --> 00:56:33.799
- I know.
- You start to feel sorry for someone...


822
00:56:33.871 --> 00:56:35.463
like Christine...

823
00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.475
and then they come back
and kick you in the teeth.


824
00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.802
Women. Nice ones,
the most frigid of the race.


825
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.179
It doesn't matter in the end.
Inside, they're all the same.


826
00:56:46.284 --> 00:56:51.221
Meat and gristle and hatred.
Just simmering.


827
00:56:51.289 --> 00:56:55.350
I, for one, have had it
with their shit. You know what I mean?


828
00:56:55.426 --> 00:56:58.827
Makes me just want to...
Something.


829
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:01.564
Sure.

830
00:57:20.318 --> 00:57:22.252
I like seeing you away from work.

831
00:57:23.487 --> 00:57:25.421
I've never done that before.

832
00:57:28.192 --> 00:57:29.955
I like your room.

833
00:57:30.928 --> 00:57:32.327
You do, huh?

834
00:57:38.869 --> 00:57:41.770
God, I am just so taken with you.
I just...


835
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:46.075
I am taken with you.

836
00:57:47.311 --> 00:57:50.337
I'm done.
I probably sound pretty stupid.


837
00:57:50.414 --> 00:57:52.439
You sound wonderful to me.

838
00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:07.622
You're so fragile.

839
00:58:09.867 --> 00:58:12.461
I can't ever imagine
not having you here.


840
00:58:13.704 --> 00:58:15.797
You feel so perfect in my arms.

841
00:58:22.046 --> 00:58:24.981
I can't believe
I'm not going to be here for the Fourth.


842
00:58:25.082 --> 00:58:28.108
- I really wanted to.
- I know.


843
00:58:28.219 --> 00:58:31.677
You have to work.
It's not your fault.


844
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:33.723
Yeah. It still stinks.

845
00:58:44.101 --> 00:58:46.035
We should go back to work.

846
00:58:51.308 --> 00:58:53.173
- Chad.
- What?


847
00:58:55.346 --> 00:58:56.745
Do you love me?

848
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:02.747
- I'm sorry.
- No.


849
00:59:04.221 --> 00:59:05.654
What?

850
00:59:07.725 --> 00:59:10.626
I think I love you,
and I just want...


851
00:59:13.998 --> 00:59:16.489
Yes, I do.

852
00:59:29.547 --> 00:59:34.211
No, I don't want an estimate.
I want to sell the thing.


853
00:59:34.318 --> 00:59:36.582
Just want to get it cleaned.

854
00:59:36.654 --> 00:59:39.384
Maybe you could look at that back post.
Feels loose.


855
00:59:43.327 --> 00:59:45.488
I mean, I know it is.

856
00:59:45.563 --> 00:59:48.589
Ended up practically ripping it
off a girl's finger.


857
00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:50.930
She didn't want it the first time.

858
00:59:51.001 --> 00:59:53.936
A few weeks later, I couldn't get her
to give it back.


859
00:59:54.004 --> 00:59:56.905
"Just want to try it on".

860
00:59:56.974 --> 00:59:59.909
Ended up wrestling
on her floor one night...


861
00:59:59.977 --> 01:00:02.775
me, pulling her hand,
she, screaming.


862
01:00:02.847 --> 01:00:05.111
Neighbors at the door.
What a mess.


863
01:00:08.185 --> 01:00:11.484
That's why it's bent a little.

864
01:00:11.555 --> 01:00:15.491
Plus I've been carrying it
in my wallet for about four months.


865
01:00:15.559 --> 01:00:19.256
So just polish it up,
make sure it's all okay.


866
01:00:20.664 --> 01:00:22.655
I'm gonna take a look at your china.

867
01:00:34.311 --> 01:00:37.246
It's a disgrace.
That's what it is.


868
01:00:37.314 --> 01:00:39.111
I know.

869
01:00:39.216 --> 01:00:42.652
- You guys are privileged. You see that?
- Sure.


870
01:00:42.753 --> 01:00:47.622
Not "Sure," and you give me the finger,
you get halfway down the hall.


871
01:00:47.691 --> 01:00:50.922
I want you to know it because
it's true, not because some dude...


872
01:00:50.995 --> 01:00:53.293
this time me, but it could be anybody...

873
01:00:53.364 --> 01:00:56.162
because some man says that it's right.

874
01:00:56.233 --> 01:00:59.896
I could have just blown this off.
I got a flight to catch tomorrow.


875
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.939
Let you figure out life
all on your little lonesome.


876
01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:07.239
I think I would have been doing you
a disservice. I really do.


877
01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:11.247
I'm not bullshitting you here.
Cherish this.


878
01:01:11.315 --> 01:01:15.308
Look, you boys are sitting
in the driver's seat.


879
01:01:15.419 --> 01:01:19.617
You can make whatever you want to happen
happen. You're in with this company.


880
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:22.420
But you're screwing around,
chasing each other in the break room...


881
01:01:22.493 --> 01:01:24.757
hanging out with a bunch of guys
from Shipping.


882
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:26.262
Where's your head?

883
01:01:28.432 --> 01:01:33.233
- Offering you a chance. Keith, right?
- Yeah. "Keif".


884
01:01:33.304 --> 01:01:35.397
- "Keith" or "Keif"?
- "Keif".


885
01:01:35.472 --> 01:01:37.565
- Which?
- Keith.


886
01:01:38.776 --> 01:01:40.710
Well, you ought to know.

887
01:01:42.513 --> 01:01:46.381
Yeah. Howard will be back
in about an hour. I'll take them.


888
01:01:46.483 --> 01:01:48.417
- Yeah.
- Thanks.


889
01:02:02.433 --> 01:02:06.563
I'm giving you the opportunity to hang
with the money people. Don't blow it.


890
01:02:06.637 --> 01:02:10.698
Sometimes I look at you guys...
interns we're given on a project.


891
01:02:10.774 --> 01:02:15.177
I'll wonder to myself,
"He got the balls for this?"


892
01:02:15.246 --> 01:02:17.407
Right? I can't help but think it.

893
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:19.415
- I do.
- Yeah?


894
01:02:19.516 --> 01:02:22.110
Yes. "Ax" anybody.

895
01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:29.392
Let me give you a professional tip.

896
01:02:30.427 --> 01:02:33.157
The word is "ask".

897
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:34.663
Okay?

898
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:42.763
You want a job like mine, one day,
sitting back and part of the show?


899
01:02:44.508 --> 01:02:46.976
The ring is dangling right there.

900
01:02:47.044 --> 01:02:51.344
You've come this far.
You just gotta grab it.


901
01:02:51.448 --> 01:02:54.383
But you need the big brass ones
for the task.


902
01:02:56.987 --> 01:02:59.046
Now you say that you've got them.

903
01:03:00.324 --> 01:03:03.487
- Yeah.
- Enough to handle this pressure cooker?


904
01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.563
Fine.

905
01:03:13.604 --> 01:03:15.265
Let's see them.

906
01:03:16.507 --> 01:03:18.839
Your clankers.
Let's see what you've got.


907
01:03:20.344 --> 01:03:22.278
- I don't...
- I'm not a homo...


908
01:03:22.346 --> 01:03:24.871
gonna leap across the table at you.

909
01:03:24.982 --> 01:03:27.951
I just want to make sure
you got what it takes.


910
01:03:28.052 --> 01:03:31.818
They asked me to recommend somebody
for the management trainee program.


911
01:03:33.123 --> 01:03:35.216
So you decide.

912
01:03:35.292 --> 01:03:37.021
Wait.

913
01:03:37.094 --> 01:03:42.031
Show me your balls.

914
01:03:42.099 --> 01:03:43.726
- I don't...
- Listen.


915
01:03:45.336 --> 01:03:49.363
You got a pair the kind that men carry
around, you wear them on your sleeve.


916
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.465
That's what business is about:

917
01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:54.909
who's sporting the nastiest sack
of venom and who is willing to use it.


918
01:03:56.046 --> 01:03:58.014
Don't be embarrassed.

919
01:04:26.243 --> 01:04:27.835
All right. Great.

920
01:04:29.079 --> 01:04:30.512
You feel okay?

921
01:04:31.715 --> 01:04:33.649
Good.

922
01:04:33.717 --> 01:04:37.653
Get me a cup of coffee before you
take off, all right? Black's fine.


923
01:04:45.062 --> 01:04:49.123
Hey. I was thinking later
we'd go for a walk by the lake.


924
01:04:49.199 --> 01:04:51.997
Supposed to be great fireworks later.

925
01:04:53.404 --> 01:04:55.395
Is everything okay?

926
01:04:55.472 --> 01:04:59.533
- Yes.
- This place? The meal? It's okay?


927
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:01.043
- Sure.
- Good.


928
01:05:02.346 --> 01:05:05.144
- I wanted to tell you...
- Howard...


929
01:05:05.249 --> 01:05:07.717
Maybe this isn't the perfect time...

930
01:05:07.785 --> 01:05:10.879
but I care about you, Christine.

931
01:05:10.988 --> 01:05:15.687
I want you to know
I like you a lot.


932
01:05:15.759 --> 01:05:18.728
- I need...
- I just don't want to lose you.


933
01:05:19.763 --> 01:05:22.755
I know we'd give up certain freedoms...

934
01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:26.064
and distance would be a problem, but...

935
01:05:26.136 --> 01:05:27.694
- No, wait.
- I could get a transfer.


936
01:05:27.771 --> 01:05:29.363
I just need you.

937
01:05:30.441 --> 01:05:32.534
I've come to realize that, and...

938
01:05:34.144 --> 01:05:35.577
I'm telling you.

939
01:05:36.547 --> 01:05:38.777
I need you.

940
01:05:40.084 --> 01:05:41.813
I taught myself that.

941
01:05:54.998 --> 01:05:56.932
Please, listen to me.

942
01:05:59.236 --> 01:06:02.364
I've let this go too far.

943
01:06:02.439 --> 01:06:04.873
- Too far?
- Yes.


944
01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:08.401
I should have told you before, but...

945
01:06:10.747 --> 01:06:13.773
I love someone else.

946
01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:16.752
I'm sorry?

947
01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:19.118
I made a mistake.

948
01:06:19.189 --> 01:06:21.214
I mean, I like you. I do.

949
01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:25.187
And you made all these plans.

950
01:06:25.262 --> 01:06:27.560
I didn't want you to feel that...

951
01:06:32.002 --> 01:06:34.994
But it was wrong
for me to come here.

952
01:06:35.906 --> 01:06:37.498
No. I mean, no.

953
01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:41.977
This is our trip. We worked this out.
It's not just me.


954
01:06:42.045 --> 01:06:46.379
We've been dating. We've been going out.
What are you talking...


955
01:06:46.483 --> 01:06:50.180
It's the man
you saw me with at lunch.


956
01:06:51.288 --> 01:06:54.655
Chad. Your friend from school.

957
01:06:56.226 --> 01:06:57.659
Chad and I...

958
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:02.264
That's who I love.

959
01:07:18.715 --> 01:07:21.206
I know it's a surprise...

960
01:07:21.318 --> 01:07:22.842
for me too.

961
01:07:23.954 --> 01:07:26.582
- Chad.
- Yes.


962
01:07:28.292 --> 01:07:31.022
- He likes you a lot.
- Yeah?


963
01:07:31.094 --> 01:07:33.722
- Yes, he does.
- Uh-huh.


964
01:07:35.866 --> 01:07:37.766
I'm sorry.

965
01:07:37.834 --> 01:07:40.234
- Right.
- No, I am.


966
01:07:40.304 --> 01:07:41.965
- Sure.
- Howard.


967
01:07:42.039 --> 01:07:44.872
Okay, you're sorry.
Terrific.


968
01:07:51.982 --> 01:07:53.472
I didn't mean...

969
01:07:56.587 --> 01:08:00.045
- It's all my fault.
- No.


970
01:08:00.157 --> 01:08:03.024
I shouldn't have dated both of you.

971
01:08:06.263 --> 01:08:08.993
You both should have known about this.

972
01:08:14.771 --> 01:08:16.204
When...

973
01:08:17.441 --> 01:08:20.467
you don't date for a while...

974
01:08:22.613 --> 01:08:24.046
you wonder...

975
01:08:25.482 --> 01:08:28.212
if you're attractive...

976
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.649
or interesting to someone.

977
01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:40.089
You let things get out of hand
first chance you get.


978
01:08:40.163 --> 01:08:42.631
That's what I did.

979
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.434
I see.

980
01:08:48.272 --> 01:08:50.240
It's just...

981
01:08:50.307 --> 01:08:52.775
when I saw you at lunch that day...

982
01:08:52.843 --> 01:08:56.836
and you were saying things
like "friends"...


983
01:08:56.913 --> 01:08:58.904
and you went to school together...

984
01:08:59.016 --> 01:09:00.711
I couldn't believe it.

985
01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:03.251
I had no idea
that the two of you...

986
01:09:05.922 --> 01:09:07.651
It was fate.

987
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:14.790
I didn't want to hurt anybody,
and I'm so sorry.


988
01:09:19.336 --> 01:09:23.500
It was a lot of fun. Really.

989
01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:28.005
This is...

990
01:09:32.049 --> 01:09:35.678
Let's get out of here.
Just get your stuff together.


991
01:09:35.786 --> 01:09:37.219
I'll...

992
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:42.324
I'll pay the check.

993
01:09:43.927 --> 01:09:45.417
I'm sorry.

994
01:09:47.531 --> 01:09:48.964
Yeah.

995
01:10:11.221 --> 01:10:13.416
- What's wrong?
- I can't...


996
01:10:14.524 --> 01:10:16.458
- What?
- We did.


997
01:10:18.295 --> 01:10:20.229
- What?
- We did know.


998
01:10:21.798 --> 01:10:24.232
I don't know what you're talking about.

999
01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:27.361
You went out with me, dated me,
had fun with me...


1000
01:10:27.437 --> 01:10:29.371
but you went to bed with him.

1001
01:10:30.374 --> 01:10:33.172
Don't say anything.
I can tell.


1002
01:10:33.243 --> 01:10:35.677
I'm sitting here,
some asshole who cares about you...


1003
01:10:35.746 --> 01:10:37.680
and you're in love with him.

1004
01:10:39.015 --> 01:10:41.245
- Please don't...
- Are you so desperate...


1005
01:10:41.351 --> 01:10:44.718
you can't see a
yard in front of you?

1006
01:10:44.788 --> 01:10:47.484
Chad? He doesn't like you.

1007
01:10:47.557 --> 01:10:49.787
He loathes you.

1008
01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.886
He detests you
and your pathetic retard voice.


1009
01:10:52.963 --> 01:10:54.897
That's what he calls it.

1010
01:10:58.268 --> 01:11:01.396
Christine, you bought that shit?

1011
01:11:01.471 --> 01:11:05.874
See each other at parties?
He's my friend, okay?


1012
01:11:05.942 --> 01:11:07.967
We hang out back home.

1013
01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:11.306
You better wake up.
You were used.


1014
01:11:12.849 --> 01:11:14.783
It's a game.

1015
01:11:14.851 --> 01:11:18.787
To Chad, it was a game,
and he found you "so perfect," he said.


1016
01:11:18.855 --> 01:11:22.018
"She's deaf". That was the thing.
Not love you.


1017
01:11:22.092 --> 01:11:25.823
Not flowers
and the feelings I have for you inside.


1018
01:11:25.896 --> 01:11:29.832
No, it was meant to be a sport...
fun to watch you fall apart.


1019
01:11:32.068 --> 01:11:34.002
- I'm telling you...
- Stop it!


1020
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.095
Christine, I...

1021
01:11:36.173 --> 01:11:39.836
We did this thing,
and I am so sorry...

1022
01:11:40.911 --> 01:11:43.937
but I can't change it because it's true.

1023
01:11:44.014 --> 01:11:46.346
No! Chad would never do that!

1024
01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:48.384
Why are you trusting him?

1025
01:11:48.452 --> 01:11:51.683
Look at me.
What did I ever do to you?


1026
01:11:51.755 --> 01:11:54.553
Kindness, courtesy.

1027
01:11:54.624 --> 01:11:58.958
What is the matter with you?
Can't you see I'm the good guy?


1028
01:11:59.029 --> 01:12:01.759
I'm the good person here.

1029
01:12:03.099 --> 01:12:06.694
I can't alter what we've done,
and I'm a fuck...


1030
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:09.898
and a bastard and everything else
on your list, but I'm here.


1031
01:12:11.241 --> 01:12:13.471
I'm here, and I'm telling you...

1032
01:12:14.377 --> 01:12:15.810
I love you.

1033
01:12:19.683 --> 01:12:21.617
Here. Please.

1034
01:12:22.986 --> 01:12:24.419
It's for you.

1035
01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:25.921
Here.

1036
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:30.851
Please? Just take this.

1037
01:12:30.927 --> 01:12:32.360
It's for you.

1038
01:12:34.264 --> 01:12:37.529
It's not a game to me anymore.

1039
01:12:38.969 --> 01:12:40.402
Take it.

1040
01:12:42.172 --> 01:12:45.699
Please, just take it.
Come on.


1041
01:12:50.847 --> 01:12:53.475
Get away from me! No!

1042
01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:56.984
You are fucking handicapped!

1043
01:12:58.455 --> 01:13:01.424
You think you can choose?
Men falling at your feet?


1044
01:13:05.295 --> 01:13:08.264
You want to call Chad?

1045
01:13:08.331 --> 01:13:09.923
Give him a ring?

1046
01:13:11.167 --> 01:13:14.034
Ask him about our little contest,
why don't you?


1047
01:13:23.513 --> 01:13:26.107
Fine! I'm lying!
Don't believe me!


1048
01:13:26.983 --> 01:13:28.416
Go to him!

1049
01:13:28.485 --> 01:13:31.420
Go ahead! Curl up
in a little bundle on his lap.


1050
01:13:31.488 --> 01:13:33.752
Suck on his sour tongue.
I don't...


1051
01:13:37.661 --> 01:13:39.595
I hope you're very happy.

1052
01:14:09.993 --> 01:14:12.120
- What's up?
- Nothing.


1053
01:14:12.195 --> 01:14:14.561
Just a little out of joint, that's all.

1054
01:14:14.631 --> 01:14:17.099
I didn't make it in yesterday,
but you heard what happened, right?


1055
01:14:17.167 --> 01:14:20.933
Part of it. I had like ten messages
on my voice mail when I got in.


1056
01:14:21.004 --> 01:14:24.269
Yeah, and I tried your beeper too.
I couldn't find you.


1057
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:28.141
Yeah, I must have turned it off.
So what happened?


1058
01:14:29.312 --> 01:14:33.715
Oh, nothing. Just had about a dozen guys
standing there holiday weekend...


1059
01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:36.285
and four pages are so light,
I can't read them.


1060
01:14:36.353 --> 01:14:39.254
- What?
- Not even the access codes.


1061
01:14:39.322 --> 01:14:43.258
The old man's looking like I personally
fucked up his T shot on 18.


1062
01:14:43.326 --> 01:14:44.258
Great.

1063
01:14:44.327 --> 01:14:45.919
He was not pleased.

1064
01:14:47.564 --> 01:14:51.000
- And?
- I got hold of the guy from downstairs.


1065
01:14:51.067 --> 01:14:52.591
I had him drive in.

1066
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:56.730
He dug around and found enough to get
into the system. I bullshitted the rest.


1067
01:14:56.806 --> 01:14:58.774
I covered us for now, but...

1068
01:14:58.842 --> 01:15:00.776
I checked those copies myself.

1069
01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:03.813
All I know is I took
what you left for me.


1070
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.905
I opened the envelope
right in front of him.


1071
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:09.612
I'm sure I did. Shit!

1072
01:15:10.887 --> 01:15:13.822
They want me back
for a meeting on Thursday.


1073
01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:16.085
- I'm sure it's cool.
- Yeah. No big deal.


1074
01:15:16.159 --> 01:15:19.856
So you fucked up their Sunday brunch.
How bad can that be?


1075
01:15:19.929 --> 01:15:22.056
We're out of here next Wednesday anyhow.

1076
01:15:22.132 --> 01:15:24.965
Right. Well, Friday for me, but...

1077
01:15:25.035 --> 01:15:26.969
It just looks...

1078
01:15:28.405 --> 01:15:30.066
I'll see you.

1079
01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.303
How about you? Good weekend?
I mean, considering?


1080
01:15:33.376 --> 01:15:35.537
- Well, fine.
- Did you see Christine?


1081
01:15:35.612 --> 01:15:37.739
- Uh-huh.
- Really? What did you guys do?


1082
01:15:37.814 --> 01:15:40.715
Just drive, dinner.
You know.


1083
01:15:40.817 --> 01:15:43.479
A drive? That's nice.

1084
01:15:43.586 --> 01:15:46.612
Quaint. A little "Magnificent Ambersons"
thing going on?


1085
01:15:46.723 --> 01:15:49.089
Yeah. Whatever.

1086
01:15:49.159 --> 01:15:53.493
There's nothing like a drive
when you need some time to yourselves.


1087
01:15:55.899 --> 01:15:57.833
I'll see you later, okay?

1088
01:15:58.568 --> 01:16:00.468
Yeah. Sorry.

1089
01:16:02.539 --> 01:16:05.838
I just don't like
what's going on here, that's all.


1090
01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:07.900
Been with the company six years.

1091
01:16:08.945 --> 01:16:12.073
Not gonna take me off a job
without some sort of fight.


1092
01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:15.444
Give me a courtesy call at least,
you know?


1093
01:16:17.654 --> 01:16:21.249
Couple little glitches
and I'm suddenly on customer support?


1094
01:16:23.059 --> 01:16:25.653
That is bullshit, okay?

1095
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:28.493
I don't care if Chad has more
background in software.


1096
01:16:28.565 --> 01:16:31.659
They should have thought of that
before they...


1097
01:16:31.735 --> 01:16:34.033
I get a demotion, blink of an eye...

1098
01:16:34.104 --> 01:16:35.969
Someone's gonna answer for that.
Right?


1099
01:16:36.039 --> 01:16:37.904
What are you talking about?

1100
01:16:38.975 --> 01:16:42.035
Nothing. I'm just babbling.

1101
01:16:42.112 --> 01:16:45.013
Geez. I'm glad it's not like that
around here.


1102
01:16:45.081 --> 01:16:47.413
No kidding.

1103
01:16:47.517 --> 01:16:52.011
Turn my back, go away for the weekend
and the earth does a nosedive on me.


1104
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.984
I mean, work, my old girlfriend...

1105
01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.188
Now that's a story in itself.

1106
01:17:00.263 --> 01:17:04.131
She won't speak to me,
but she's calling my parents.


1107
01:17:05.468 --> 01:17:08.096
I mean... God! Everything.

1108
01:17:09.606 --> 01:17:12.200
What the hell has happened to me here?

1109
01:17:15.011 --> 01:17:18.469
I used to be like this adjusted person.

1110
01:17:37.767 --> 01:17:40.395
I don't...

1111
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.438
No? It's okay.

1112
01:17:43.506 --> 01:17:47.067
No. I don't mean that. I need...

1113
01:17:47.143 --> 01:17:48.838
What?

1114
01:17:48.912 --> 01:17:51.278
I'm sorry
I haven't been able to see you.


1115
01:17:51.347 --> 01:17:55.283
It's just that we're
finishing things up, and it's been busy.


1116
01:17:55.385 --> 01:17:57.910
I did want to.
I left a message with your mom.


1117
01:17:58.021 --> 01:18:01.286
- I know...
- What?


1118
01:18:01.357 --> 01:18:03.052
Come here.

1119
01:18:05.929 --> 01:18:07.794
Look.

1120
01:18:07.864 --> 01:18:10.492
We are going to see each other again.

1121
01:18:11.568 --> 01:18:13.502
I promise you.

1122
01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:20.642
I know this is hard.

1123
01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:25.241
Do you love me?

1124
01:18:25.315 --> 01:18:28.182
Yes. Just like yesterday.

1125
01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:33.084
Do you really love me?

1126
01:18:36.092 --> 01:18:38.026
Of course.

1127
01:18:55.144 --> 01:18:57.169
What's the matter?
You're quiet all night.


1128
01:18:59.048 --> 01:19:01.539
- I know.
- What?


1129
01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.083
No, seriously. What?
Have I done something?


1130
01:19:07.156 --> 01:19:09.147
I know what's going on.

1131
01:19:11.661 --> 01:19:13.094
What?

1132
01:19:16.065 --> 01:19:17.999
I don't know what...

1133
01:19:21.004 --> 01:19:23.234
You mean Howard?

1134
01:19:23.306 --> 01:19:28.141
You and Howard, right? You went out
with him a few times when I was gone.


1135
01:19:28.211 --> 01:19:30.179
- Yes.
- He told me about your trip.


1136
01:19:30.246 --> 01:19:33.238
I drove him to the airport,
and he told me.


1137
01:19:33.316 --> 01:19:36.444
I was gonna say something,
but, I mean...


1138
01:19:36.552 --> 01:19:40.249
Listen. It doesn't matter. We talked
about seeing other people, right?


1139
01:19:40.323 --> 01:19:44.851
- Yes, but, I know...
- I told you it's okay. I still...


1140
01:19:44.928 --> 01:19:47.954
I just figured you were embarrassed.
That's why you didn't say something.


1141
01:19:48.031 --> 01:19:50.090
No! About what you're doing.

1142
01:19:52.969 --> 01:19:55.802
You're confusing me.
I don't know what you're talking about.


1143
01:19:55.872 --> 01:19:59.035
What the two of you
are doing to me.


1144
01:19:59.108 --> 01:20:01.599
- Howard told me.
- Christine...


1145
01:20:01.678 --> 01:20:04.943
Look. This is silly,
because I don't know. Okay?


1146
01:20:05.014 --> 01:20:06.606
The game.

1147
01:20:11.054 --> 01:20:14.387
You two were playing a game on me,
right?


1148
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:20.761
Are you playing a game with me?

1149
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:24.165
Please tell me.

1150
01:20:29.872 --> 01:20:31.806
Howard told you, huh?

1151
01:20:34.377 --> 01:20:36.311
Well, well.

1152
01:20:38.548 --> 01:20:41.574
All right. Don't say anything
for a second. Let me explain.


1153
01:20:42.819 --> 01:20:44.787
It... Shit!

1154
01:20:44.854 --> 01:20:47.846
Christine, it...
It wasn't a game.


1155
01:20:47.957 --> 01:20:51.222
We both noticed you, and we...

1156
01:20:52.228 --> 01:20:54.162
Please try... Understand this.

1157
01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:57.597
It turned into sort of a contest
because we both wanted to...


1158
01:21:08.745 --> 01:21:11.908
I was gonna let you down easy,
but I can't keep a straight face...


1159
01:21:11.981 --> 01:21:15.280
so fuck it.

1160
01:21:15.385 --> 01:21:17.819
Surprise.

1161
01:21:20.623 --> 01:21:22.557
So how does it feel?

1162
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.955
I mean right now.

1163
01:21:26.029 --> 01:21:29.521
This instant. How do you feel inside,
knowing what you know?


1164
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:33.093
Tell me.

1165
01:21:53.156 --> 01:21:54.714
That's all?

1166
01:21:56.626 --> 01:21:58.753
It only hurts that much?

1167
01:22:02.065 --> 01:22:04.556
Well, I guess I can go then.

1168
01:22:04.634 --> 01:22:06.568
The deed's done.

1169
01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:07.353
- Who is it?
- It's me.


1170
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:22.088
What's going on? 
It's almost 1:00.

1171
01:24:22.158 --> 01:24:24.456
- At my home.
- Yeah. Sorry.


1172
01:24:25.695 --> 01:24:27.629
Couldn't sleep.

1173
01:24:30.433 --> 01:24:31.627
Nice.

1174
01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:38.033
It's a little smaller
than your last place.


1175
01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:41.008
Yeah, but it's a great old building.
Plus the park.


1176
01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:44.569
- Right. Yeah. It's terrific.
- Still doing a little touch-up.


1177
01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:52.183
Looks like you got a new frame there
for "Gigolo".


1178
01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:54.347
Right?

1179
01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:56.357
It looks good.

1180
01:24:57.226 --> 01:25:02.289
It's almost got...
and I mean this the right way...


1181
01:25:02.365 --> 01:25:03.957
a woman's touch.

1182
01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:07.194
Thank you, Howard.

1183
01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:08.736
Sure.

1184
01:25:11.574 --> 01:25:13.508
So what is it?

1185
01:25:16.245 --> 01:25:18.304
I don't know. I mean...

1186
01:25:21.484 --> 01:25:22.746
Shit!

1187
01:25:23.886 --> 01:25:27.879
The last couple of days,
I'm getting maybe three hours a night.


1188
01:25:27.957 --> 01:25:30.084
I cannot eat.

1189
01:25:30.159 --> 01:25:32.753
Couldn't hold down rice pudding.
Yesterday, I bought some at lunch.


1190
01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:34.420
Threw it up 30 minutes later.

1191
01:25:34.497 --> 01:25:36.692
- Fascinating.
- I'm just illustrating my point.


1192
01:25:38.034 --> 01:25:40.366
I'm sick, Chad. 
I'm dying here.

1193
01:25:40.436 --> 01:25:42.836
I mean, this whole... Fuck!

1194
01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:45.703
I know! It puts me in a shitty position
too. I didn't ask for this thing.


1195
01:25:45.775 --> 01:25:48.175
And then they move you downstairs
with that new dude.


1196
01:25:48.244 --> 01:25:50.542
I mean, goddamn.

1197
01:25:50.613 --> 01:25:53.275
- I told you to watch out.
- No, Chad...


1198
01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:55.408
Want that corner office?
I can say something...


1199
01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.508
Look!

1200
01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.251
It's Christine.

1201
01:26:02.792 --> 01:26:06.785
I'm here. Gotta talk, because of her.

1202
01:26:17.039 --> 01:26:18.734
- You did it, right?
- Did what?


1203
01:26:18.808 --> 01:26:21.504
- Told her.
- Yeah. It just sort of...


1204
01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.079
Kind of caught me off guard, you know?

1205
01:26:26.148 --> 01:26:28.139
Might of said something
to me first.


1206
01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:34.517
I thought it was an unwritten that we'd
keep the mechanics of it to ourselves.


1207
01:26:36.559 --> 01:26:38.493
So she said
that you told her everything.


1208
01:26:38.561 --> 01:26:40.461
- Yes.
- And?


1209
01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:43.327
- Come on, Chad.
- What, Howard?


1210
01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:45.593
I'm just curious.
I think I'm allowed that.


1211
01:26:48.337 --> 01:26:50.635
So how did it feel?

1212
01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:53.808
Lousy, okay?

1213
01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.505
- Jesus. She just fell apart.
- You told her that I...


1214
01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:01.710
Yes, I told her, and I'm watching this...
God! I can't believe it!


1215
01:27:01.784 --> 01:27:05.584
- Man, I wish I'd been there.
- I've never done anything like that.


1216
01:27:06.655 --> 01:27:09.624
I did it short. 
Over in a second.

1217
01:27:10.759 --> 01:27:13.159
Left her sobbing in the hotel room.

1218
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:15.163
Then I walked over to Pizza Hut.

1219
01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:18.590
It was your hotel room actually.

1220
01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:21.431
What?

1221
01:27:21.504 --> 01:27:25.873
See, I knew you'd be late wrapping stuff
up, so I took the liberty.


1222
01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:29.104
I got a maid
to open up, and I...

1223
01:27:29.178 --> 01:27:32.204
Well, I did the same thing
when I first fucked her.


1224
01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:36.179
I thought that you might find her there,
so...


1225
01:27:36.252 --> 01:27:38.914
- Chad.
- What?


1226
01:27:38.988 --> 01:27:42.082
I'm trying to tell you
I'm in love with her.


1227
01:27:42.158 --> 01:27:44.092
Jesus Christ!

1228
01:27:48.063 --> 01:27:50.657
I mean, you know...
It's a game and all.


1229
01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:54.634
It's funny. First to agree with you,
but shit!


1230
01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:02.576
What?

1231
01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:39.776
- When did she get here?
- What do you mean?


1232
01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:42.043
What do you mean, what do I mean?
That's Suzanne, right?


1233
01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:46.747
She's sleeping in the middle
of your king-size. So what the hell?


1234
01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:49.552
I mean, when did she crawl back?

1235
01:28:50.593 --> 01:28:52.527
This is what? Friday?

1236
01:28:53.596 --> 01:28:55.530
- Yeah.
- So, Friday. Three days...


1237
01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:58.394
- Never.
- Huh?


1238
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.934
She never left, Howie.

1239
01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:03.938
You're getting all weepy on me here,
and I gotta get some sleep.


1240
01:29:04.006 --> 01:29:07.908
We're gonna go to the beach in the
morning, so, let you in on the truth.


1241
01:29:08.978 --> 01:29:11.003
She never left.

1242
01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.708
She's always been right there.

1243
01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:16.080
But I...

1244
01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:18.085
Well, then...

1245
01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:21.684
Then why?

1246
01:29:22.758 --> 01:29:24.692
Why, Chad?

1247
01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:27.695
Because I could.

1248
01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:33.100
Oh, my God.

1249
01:29:36.672 --> 01:29:39.300
So how does it feel, Howie?

1250
01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:41.639
How does it feel
to really hurt someone?


1251
01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.644
Oh, my God.

1252
01:29:56.025 --> 01:29:57.959
See you Monday.

1253
01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:32.059
Time is it?

1254
01:30:34.563 --> 01:30:36.497
It's around 1:00.

1255
01:30:40.069 --> 01:30:42.003
Not tired?

1256
01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.874
No. I was just finishing up a program.

1257
01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:54.980
You smell nice.

1258
01:30:56.385 --> 01:30:57.818
Thanks.

1259
01:31:05.027 --> 01:31:07.791
Did I hear somebody come over?

1260
01:31:07.863 --> 01:31:09.797
- I thought I did.
- No.


1261
01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.134
I was just talking to myself.

1262
01:31:14.403 --> 01:31:16.371
Really?

1263
01:31:16.472 --> 01:31:19.407
Yeah. I was working on
my presentation earlier, that's all.


1264
01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:25.379
You know me, right?

1265
01:31:29.218 --> 01:31:30.810
Sure do.

1266
01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:33.286
I get working.

1267
01:31:33.355 --> 01:31:35.585
Then I can sound like
practically anybody.


1268
01:33:24.333 --> 01:33:26.233
Listen.

1269
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.618
Listen to me!
