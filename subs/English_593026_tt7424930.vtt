00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:19.537
Hi, there.

14
00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.572
- Is the test subject prepared?
- Yes, Doctor.


15
00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:29.677
- Is the serum ready?
- Ready.


16
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:42.688
De-evolution Test 103.

17
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.827
<i>I have modified the serum slightly in
hopes of awakening its dinosaur DNA.</i>

00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:52.300
[low growl]

19
00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:03.545
Begin low-level radiation.

[snarls]

23
00:04:16.926 --> 00:04:18.094
Shut it down.

Keep recording!
Keep recording!

[roaring]

28
00:04:33.242 --> 00:04:34.710
Get the tranquilizer gun!

29
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:52.362
[snarling]

30
00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:54.932
Hit it again!

31
00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:05.041
I thought that
you were done for.


32
00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:08.244
Yes. Did you hear that roar?

33
00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:09.948
I'm getting so very close.

34
00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.351
Just missing a little...
something.


35
00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:18.255
Hmm. Take tissue samples
of every organ.


36
00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:20.423
Cryo-freeze the body
afterwards,


37
00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:22.025
I may need
some more samples later.


38
00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.130
Mm-hm.

39
00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.203
[door closes]

40
00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:43.142
[woman] And for example, some people
incorrectly believe that the T-Rex


41
00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:46.847
and the saber-toothed tiger
were alive during the same era.


42
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:50.014
We have Hollywood
to thank for that.


43
00:06:50.016 --> 00:06:51.918
[all laughing]

44
00:06:57.023 --> 00:07:03.030
Dinosaurs roamed the Earth between

45
00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:06.198
until mass extinction
wiped them all out.


46
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.570
Many scientists believe that an
asteroid slammed into the Earth


47
00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:14.106
causing earthquakes,
volcanoes, forest fires,


48
00:07:14.108 --> 00:07:16.378
and tsunamis
all around the world.


49
00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:19.780
Yes? You have a question?

50
00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:21.816
You said
they all became extinct?


51
00:07:22.084 --> 00:07:23.283
That is correct.

52
00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:25.352
But aren't there animals
alive today


53
00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:27.588
who were relatives
of the large dinosaurs?


54
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.057
Birds, for example?

55
00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:33.161
Great question.
And once again, you are correct.


56
00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:35.828
Many current species
alive today,


57
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.199
including birds,
snakes, and frogs


58
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.271
are distant relatives to the
dinosaur, just to name a few.


59
00:07:42.904 --> 00:07:45.538
Is it possible then that
a large dinosaur like this


60
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.175
could be out there somewhere,
just waiting to be rediscovered?


61
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.478
[laughs]

62
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.546
Dork. There he goes again.

63
00:07:52.548 --> 00:07:54.417
- "Ooh, dinosaurs."
- [all laugh]


64
00:07:56.985 --> 00:08:00.221
Don't listen to him.
He wishes he could have your brains.


65
00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:03.159
Okay, everyone, just...
Manners.


66
00:08:05.962 --> 00:08:09.198
That would be the find of the
century, but, sadly, no.


67
00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:12.334
The biggest relatives
alive today to the dinosaur


68
00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:14.904
are the alligators
and the crocodiles.


69
00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:17.272
Now, if you all
will follow me this way,


70
00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:19.908
we're going to look
at the theropods.


71
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.577
The theropods
are two-legged predators...


72
00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:24.914
[continues indistinctly]

73
00:08:41.098 --> 00:08:43.666
Pentaceratops were herbivores,
and we all know


74
00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:46.902
- herbivores don't eat any...
- [all] Meat!


75
00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:50.408
He looks like he hasn't eaten
anything in at least 65 million years.


76
00:08:50.608 --> 00:08:52.444
- [kids groan]
- Okay, that's...


77
00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:55.478
- Where's Chris?
- I thought he was right here.


78
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.482
He's probably off in his
own world or something.


79
00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:00.383
You know how much strange and
unusual things make him lose time.


80
00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:02.452
We need to find him
before he gets into trouble.


81
00:09:02.454 --> 00:09:05.288
And if you'll come with me this
way, I'll show you a species


82
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.026
that was discovered
not too far from here.


83
00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:35.187
- Jeez! You scared me.
- We've been looking for you.


84
00:09:35.654 --> 00:09:37.321
Where did everybody go?

85
00:09:37.323 --> 00:09:39.022
The group moved on
a while ago.


86
00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:41.026
Lucky for you,
Mr. Brown hasn't noticed yet.


87
00:09:42.294 --> 00:09:44.361
We better catch up.

88
00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:46.296
I don't know about you two,
but I don't want detention again.


89
00:09:46.298 --> 00:09:48.134
No kidding.
My parents will kill me.


90
00:09:52.406 --> 00:09:56.141
And that's why archaeologists take
an immense amount of time and care


91
00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:58.545
when removing artifacts
from where they're located.


92
00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.446
It's very interesting.
Wouldn't you agree, Chris?


93
00:10:02.448 --> 00:10:04.982
Uh, yes, Mr. Brown.
Very fascinating.


94
00:10:04.984 --> 00:10:06.386
Yes, she is.

95
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.021
It is.

96
00:10:09.823 --> 00:10:11.656
And if you'll follow me
this way,


97
00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:13.193
I'll show you
another exhibit.


98
00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:21.634
Let's go! I gotta be on time.
Addie, Cole, Karlin. Uh...


99
00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:24.337
Single file, please!
Just... Just get on.


100
00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:27.573
[mumbles] Karlin...
You know what, here is your cell phone.


101
00:10:27.575 --> 00:10:29.375
Do not make me take it away
from you again.


102
00:10:29.377 --> 00:10:32.478
Good, you found your backpack.
And Alexander found his shoes.


103
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.449
Why'd you take your shoes off,
anyway? Okay!


104
00:10:35.183 --> 00:10:36.715
We got 18. Here we go... Oh!

105
00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:38.752
And John, and Carrie,
and Chris.


106
00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:40.553
Good of you
not to wander off this time.


107
00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:42.223
- Yes, sir, Mr. Brown.
- All right.


108
00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:44.658
[sighs] That's everybody.

109
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.562
Okay. All right.
Let me sit down, let me sit down.


110
00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:49.597
[whirring]

111
00:10:50.798 --> 00:10:52.233
[beeping]

112
00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:56.003
Oh! Blast it all!
What am I doing wrong?


113
00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:02.644
The alligator has been
processed and stored.


114
00:11:03.378 --> 00:11:04.544
Here's the sample
you requested.


115
00:11:04.546 --> 00:11:06.111
Thank you.

116
00:11:06.113 --> 00:11:08.215
If we don't show
some significant results soon,


117
00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:09.685
I will lose my funding.

118
00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:13.753
I mean, come on, there's not even
any visible mitochondrial structure


119
00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:15.355
in the last sample
you gave me.


120
00:11:15.357 --> 00:11:17.660
I'm working with a bunch
of amateur nitwits here!


121
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:20.360
Anything else, Doctor?

122
00:11:20.362 --> 00:11:21.664
No, no, no,
you're free to go.


123
00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:25.000
Oh! One more thing.

124
00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:28.636
If you put
that mayonnaise stuff


125
00:11:28.638 --> 00:11:31.007
instead of mustard
on my next sandwich...


126
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:33.209
you're fired.

127
00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:40.080
I thought
we were dead for sure.


128
00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:42.617
Yeah. Chris, my mom will
think you're a bad influence.


129
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:46.254
Sorry, guys. It's just, there's so
much that's unknown in the universe,


130
00:11:46.256 --> 00:11:47.321
let alone the world.

131
00:11:47.323 --> 00:11:49.058
It's kind of mind-boggling.

132
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.260
I love you
for your uniqueness, but...


133
00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:54.765
You better keep your mind on
your school studies for now.


134
00:12:03.507 --> 00:12:05.274
Hey, come on.
I got homework.


135
00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:06.176
You two go ahead.

136
00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:08.277
- What?
- I'll see you tomorrow.


137
00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:09.678
I want to check
this place out.


138
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.747
Don't be too long.

139
00:12:11.749 --> 00:12:13.582
You don't want your mom to send
out the army looking for you.


140
00:12:13.584 --> 00:12:15.119
[laughs]

141
00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:56.796
[dings]

142
00:12:58.598 --> 00:13:00.333
Sorry. You startled me.

143
00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.435
Toy store is down the street.

144
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.270
I was never much into toys,

145
00:13:06.272 --> 00:13:09.141
unless it was to take them
apart and see how they worked.


146
00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:11.476
Ah.

147
00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:15.581
A young mind
seeking knowledge.


148
00:13:16.247 --> 00:13:18.417
The world
is full of knowledge.


149
00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:20.386
And magic.

150
00:13:22.388 --> 00:13:23.589
Okay.

151
00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:28.728
So what can I do
for you, young sir?


152
00:13:29.362 --> 00:13:31.297
What are you
looking for today?


153
00:13:31.698 --> 00:13:36.436
I'm always on the lookout for
something different, unusual.


154
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.704
Unusual?

155
00:13:38.905 --> 00:13:42.643
[chuckles] Most boys your age
find girls to be unusual.


156
00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:46.346
Mmm.

157
00:13:49.817 --> 00:13:52.486
This is a mummified cat.

158
00:13:53.353 --> 00:13:56.891
Cats were so important
to Egyptian culture


159
00:13:57.392 --> 00:14:00.394
that many of them
were mummified after death.


160
00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:03.561
I studied Egypt.

161
00:14:03.563 --> 00:14:08.635
In 1888, a farmer found a tomb
containing over 80,000 mummified cats.


162
00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:17.845
The object inside of this
is over 100 million years old.


163
00:14:23.284 --> 00:14:26.855
Oh. It's a spider.
I have one of these with a mosquito in it.


164
00:14:28.656 --> 00:14:30.759
These aren't
just paperweights!


165
00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:33.562
They are echoes
of the past,


166
00:14:34.463 --> 00:14:36.799
living and breathing creatures

167
00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:40.467
that walked the Earth
millennia before you were born!


168
00:14:40.469 --> 00:14:43.572
They're right in front of you,
trying to tell you their story.


169
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.573
They did their talking
years ago.


170
00:14:46.575 --> 00:14:48.276
All you have to do is listen.

171
00:14:56.618 --> 00:14:59.955
I guess I have nothing
that you want.


172
00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:03.290
- But...
- You're not ready for what I have.


173
00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:04.827
I'm ready for anything.

174
00:15:07.463 --> 00:15:12.401
What exactly
are you looking for?


175
00:15:13.603 --> 00:15:17.373
When I said that I wanted
something unusual, I meant...


176
00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:20.543
I want something
that I've never seen before.


177
00:15:22.345 --> 00:15:26.382
I want something
that nobody's ever seen before.


178
00:15:26.851 --> 00:15:27.785
Hmm.

179
00:15:38.862 --> 00:15:42.532
I know
you're in here somewhere.


180
00:15:43.767 --> 00:15:46.336
Where are you? Ah!

181
00:15:48.706 --> 00:15:49.774
[groans]

182
00:15:50.406 --> 00:15:51.642
Wrong box.

183
00:15:54.845 --> 00:15:55.880
Ah.

184
00:15:58.816 --> 00:16:00.751
[creaks]

185
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.922
There you are.

186
00:16:14.966 --> 00:16:17.769
It's time, my friend.

187
00:16:20.907 --> 00:16:22.074
Here it is.

188
00:16:23.707 --> 00:16:26.645
This is what you need.

189
00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:34.719
What's so special about this?
It's just a box.


190
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.489
And it doesn't even open.

191
00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.589
You have to earn it.

192
00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:42.061
Once you've proven
that you're worthy,


193
00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:46.566
then and only then,
will you be able to open it.


194
00:16:47.499 --> 00:16:48.701
Hmm.

195
00:16:50.403 --> 00:16:51.669
How much do you want for it?

196
00:16:51.671 --> 00:16:53.704
I don't want money for it.

197
00:16:53.706 --> 00:16:59.710
I only require that you promise
to take great care of it.


198
00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:00.713
Can you do that?

199
00:17:01.447 --> 00:17:03.116
Yes. I promise.

200
00:17:10.624 --> 00:17:12.692
Thank you. I promise.

201
00:18:01.042 --> 00:18:02.509
How was the museum?

202
00:18:03.111 --> 00:18:04.210
It was okay.

203
00:18:04.212 --> 00:18:06.080
Chris, this room is the pits!

204
00:18:07.015 --> 00:18:09.651
You know what they say,
smart people are messy.


205
00:18:10.485 --> 00:18:11.184
Who said that?

206
00:18:11.186 --> 00:18:12.587
Other smart people.

207
00:18:13.721 --> 00:18:16.656
[chuckles] Well, I'm not their
mother, so I don't care what they do.


208
00:18:16.658 --> 00:18:18.426
Thanks, Mom.
I can get the rest.


209
00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:21.228
Dinner will be ready
shortly.


210
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.530
I'll be down soon.

211
00:18:50.025 --> 00:18:51.127
An egg?

212
00:19:03.239 --> 00:19:05.106
<i>When hatching a chicken egg,</i>

213
00:19:05.108 --> 00:19:08.243
<i>the egg always
must be kept warm.</i>


214
00:19:08.245 --> 00:19:14.151
<i>The hen only leaves the egg
to get food or water.</i>


215
00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:32.135
[mother] Chris, dinner's ready!

216
00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.038
Coming!

217
00:19:55.927 --> 00:19:58.196
- Whoa. Slow down, champ.
- Sorry.


218
00:19:58.764 --> 00:19:59.798
Who wants dessert?

219
00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.967
- Yes, please.
- None for me, thank you.


220
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.067
What? When do you pass
on apple pie?


221
00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:05.904
I have a lot of homework,
Mom.


222
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.175
Homework?

223
00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:13.811
Never seen a kid
so excited to do homework.


224
00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:14.847
[chuckles]

225
00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:17.114
Must get that
from your side of family.


226
00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:18.818
Mmm...

227
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.754
[laughs]

228
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.870
I'll have to warm you up again soon.
I hope you're worth it.

No! Stop! What are you doing?

233
00:21:47.309 --> 00:21:49.145
No! Oh, my gosh.

234
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.720
Whoa.

235
00:22:00.722 --> 00:22:02.021
- [mother] Is everything okay up there?
- Yeah!


236
00:22:02.023 --> 00:22:04.360
I just read something
very... interesting.


237
00:22:13.969 --> 00:22:15.371
I won't hurt you, little guy.

238
00:22:16.138 --> 00:22:19.072
Come on.
You don't have to be afraid.

[squeaks]

240

Come out.

241
00:22:31.888 --> 00:22:33.156
I'm not a bad guy.

242
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.125
I promised
to take care of you.

My name is Chris.

00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:52.709
You are amazing.

246
00:22:54.244 --> 00:22:56.112
[laughs]

247
00:22:59.417 --> 00:23:02.353
John and Carrie are going to
freak out when they see you.


248
00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:08.059
Don't eat my homework!

249
00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:09.994
I need this!

250
00:23:12.296 --> 00:23:13.798
Still hungry, huh?

251
00:23:15.534 --> 00:23:16.834
I'll be right back.

252
00:23:18.537 --> 00:23:19.737
[door opens]

253
00:23:29.448 --> 00:23:30.949
Changed your mind
about dessert?


254
00:23:31.316 --> 00:23:34.050
Yeah. Just taking a break
from my homework.

Uh, I must have left my...

00:23:52.505 --> 00:23:54.906
- window open.
- Hey!


263
00:23:55.375 --> 00:23:56.507
Yeah?

264
00:23:56.509 --> 00:23:57.976
Aren't you
forgetting something?


265

Have you gotten bigger?

- Albert.

Hey! Where are you going?

[knocking on door]

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:13.051
What's going on in there?

280
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:15.223
[Chris] Nothing.
I was just reading.


281
00:25:15.956 --> 00:25:18.193
Well, finish up.
It's time to go to bed.


282
00:25:18.926 --> 00:25:20.195
You have school
in the morning.

Okay, Mom. I will.

That's my mom.

She takes care of me, and...

288

I'll take care of you.

00:25:37.313 --> 00:25:39.482
Albert,
we better settle down.


291
00:25:39.715 --> 00:25:42.318
We wouldn't want Mom to come
back in here and see you.

Shh.

303
00:26:42.915 --> 00:26:45.116
You'll have to be quiet.
I don't want anyone to take you away.


304
00:26:51.322 --> 00:26:53.122
Hope you didn't
get home late again.


305
00:26:53.124 --> 00:26:55.024
No.

306
00:26:55.026 --> 00:26:56.727
Did you finish the math homework?
I don't think I did it right.

00:26:57.195 --> 00:26:58.529
Uh... Whoa.

308
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.099
What is that thing?

00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:05.201
Shh.

310
00:27:05.203 --> 00:27:06.304
It's a dinosaur.

311
00:27:06.605 --> 00:27:08.272
It's so cute!

312
00:27:10.107 --> 00:27:12.742
Does it have a name?
What's its name? Can I pet it?


313
00:27:12.744 --> 00:27:16.648
His name is Albert.
And yes, you can pet him.

Aw.

00:27:23.255 --> 00:27:24.421
Where did he come from?

316
00:27:24.423 --> 00:27:26.459
The shop I went into
after school.


317
00:27:26.693 --> 00:27:29.660
The owner gave me a box and
told me to take care of it.


318
00:27:29.662 --> 00:27:33.032
All I know is that there was
an egg in it and it hatched.


319
00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:35.400
He seems to be growing
quickly, too.


320
00:27:36.134 --> 00:27:38.036
He just gave you a dinosaur?

321
00:27:38.537 --> 00:27:39.404
Yeah.

[chuckles]

324
00:27:45.445 --> 00:27:46.646
He won't hurt you.

325
00:27:47.547 --> 00:27:48.781
You need to tell
your mom and dad.


326
00:27:49.182 --> 00:27:51.417
No way.
They wouldn't understand.


327
00:27:51.718 --> 00:27:54.621
Albert chose me.
He's my responsibility.


328
00:27:56.289 --> 00:27:57.758
[John] So what are you
going to do?


329
00:27:59.225 --> 00:28:01.560
I'm going back to the shop to talk
to the old man who gave him to me.


330
00:28:01.562 --> 00:28:02.828
What about school?

331
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.262
I'm not going today.

332
00:28:04.264 --> 00:28:05.597
You're going
to get in trouble.


333
00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:07.468
Just tell them
I'm sick or something!


334
00:28:24.718 --> 00:28:26.119
[doorbell dings]

335
00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:35.797
I don't get it.

336
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.498
Well, hello there.
May I help you?


337
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.334
Um, yes.
I was in here yesterday.


338
00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:45.538
I need to talk to the old man
who gave me the box.


339
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.274
An old man? [laughs]

340
00:28:48.276 --> 00:28:50.278
Honey, I don't know
what you're talking about.


341
00:28:50.912 --> 00:28:53.348
Are you sure
you're in the right place?


342
00:28:53.883 --> 00:28:55.148
Yes!

343
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.484
Uh, well...

344
00:28:56.686 --> 00:29:00.088
This is my shop and I'm the
only one who works here.


345
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:04.460
But there was an old man.
I stood right here.


346
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.660
There!
That picture, that's him!


347
00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:08.896
I need to talk to him.
It's important.


348
00:29:08.898 --> 00:29:10.266
Oh, honey.

349
00:29:11.232 --> 00:29:12.734
This is my husband.

350
00:29:13.535 --> 00:29:15.236
We opened this shop
together.


351
00:29:15.805 --> 00:29:17.205
But he died.

352
00:29:17.439 --> 00:29:19.807
Uh, more than
five years ago.


353
00:29:19.809 --> 00:29:21.174
What?

354
00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:23.713
But I was with him here
yesterday.


355
00:29:24.447 --> 00:29:25.781
Oh, my darling.

356
00:29:26.582 --> 00:29:28.551
I think
you must have dreamt it.


357
00:29:29.552 --> 00:29:30.919
I'm sorry
for bothering you.


358
00:29:30.921 --> 00:29:32.355
Oh, honey, it's all right.

359
00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:37.959
Carrie is right.
I might be losing my mind.


360
00:29:37.961 --> 00:29:40.129
[Albert chitters]

361
00:29:47.571 --> 00:29:49.406
Don't worry, Albert.
I know where to go.


362
00:30:10.727 --> 00:30:13.196
Oh, you can't just go inside.

363
00:30:14.999 --> 00:30:18.233
Oh, I have to keep track
of all the students


364
00:30:18.235 --> 00:30:21.504
Mr. Brown is bringing
through here, in the museum,


365
00:30:21.506 --> 00:30:23.406
on field trips this week.

366
00:30:23.408 --> 00:30:24.909
[chitters]

367
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.245
- Uh, did you say something?
- [coughs]


368
00:30:29.247 --> 00:30:31.915
Sorry. Did you say
Mr. Brown was here?


369
00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:34.350
Oh, they've already gone in.

370
00:30:34.352 --> 00:30:36.620
Last one off the bus?
You better catch up.


371
00:30:36.622 --> 00:30:38.289
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.


372
00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:44.628
We can thank Hollywood
for that.


373
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.297
[kids laughing]

374
00:30:49.267 --> 00:30:54.905
Dinosaurs roamed the Earth between

375
00:30:54.907 --> 00:30:57.409
until mass extinction
wiped them all out.


376
00:30:57.776 --> 00:30:59.445
Many scientists believe...

377
00:31:32.512 --> 00:31:33.547
Enjoy.

378
00:31:37.317 --> 00:31:39.018
Nice day, Dr. Jost.

379
00:31:40.987 --> 00:31:44.388
Are there school children here today?
I saw a bus outside.


380
00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:48.326
Yes, the local science teacher is
bringing them every day this week.


381
00:31:48.328 --> 00:31:49.795
Oh, goodie for me.

382
00:31:49.797 --> 00:31:52.664
I hear that Dr. Roberts
has a new specimen for you.


383
00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:54.433
I think
you'll really like it.


384
00:31:54.435 --> 00:31:56.537
I hope so.
I only collect the best.


385
00:31:56.937 --> 00:31:59.607
He's waiting
in his office for you.


386
00:32:00.074 --> 00:32:01.976
I hope it jumps up
and bites you.


387
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.379
Oh. Hello! And welcome.

388
00:32:13.354 --> 00:32:15.590
[softly] Albert!
Get back here!


389
00:32:18.927 --> 00:32:20.894
Hey, look how real
this one looks.


390
00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:22.895
Whoa, no kidding!

391
00:32:22.897 --> 00:32:24.097
- Take my picture.
- Yeah!


392
00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:25.000
Excuse us.

393
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.034
Say "Triceratops."

394
00:32:28.036 --> 00:32:29.938
- Triceratops.
- [camera clicks]


395
00:32:33.408 --> 00:32:34.442
What was that?

396
00:32:37.813 --> 00:32:38.747
Morning, Mr. Jost.

397
00:32:40.116 --> 00:32:41.716
[clears throat] Ms. Carter.

398
00:32:43.152 --> 00:32:46.655
I did not spend 14 years

399
00:32:47.123 --> 00:32:49.990
at some of the most prestigious
universities in Europe,


400
00:32:49.992 --> 00:32:52.059
earning three
doctorate degrees,


401
00:32:52.061 --> 00:32:56.530
making me singularly the most highly
qualified scientist in my field,


402
00:32:56.532 --> 00:32:58.968
simply for you
to call me "Mister".


403
00:32:59.802 --> 00:33:01.604
It's Dr. Jost.

404
00:33:02.505 --> 00:33:04.806
Do you understand,
Ms. Carter?


405
00:33:04.808 --> 00:33:06.810
Yes. Sorry, Doctor.

406
00:33:07.644 --> 00:33:11.981
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

407
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.586
- [clears throat]
- [chuckles]


408
00:33:16.786 --> 00:33:18.686
- Dr. Jost.
- Dr. Roberts.


409
00:33:18.688 --> 00:33:20.721
How's your research going?

410
00:33:20.723 --> 00:33:24.059
Oh, fine, fine. I think I'm on the
verge of a significant breakthrough.


411
00:33:24.061 --> 00:33:25.994
Wonderful, wonderful.

412
00:33:25.996 --> 00:33:28.597
Well, I hope we have something
that can aid in your research.


413
00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:31.568
We really appreciate you
buying our extra specimens.


414
00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:35.437
The museum can always use
the additional money.


415
00:33:35.439 --> 00:33:37.441
Well I... I do what I can.

416
00:33:37.975 --> 00:33:40.977
So what do you have
for me today?


417
00:33:40.979 --> 00:33:44.883
I have a few items
you might be interested in.


418
00:33:45.216 --> 00:33:47.884
I already have multiples
of each of these.


419
00:33:47.886 --> 00:33:50.486
These are just
gift store trinkets.


420
00:33:50.488 --> 00:33:52.690
These will not aid
in my research.


421
00:33:53.157 --> 00:33:58.961
What I'm looking for is a frozen
dinosaur or an un-petrified egg.


422
00:33:58.963 --> 00:34:01.496
Something from which I can get
some good tissue samples


423
00:34:01.498 --> 00:34:03.101
or some viable DNA.

424
00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:07.036
If that's ever found,
it would be worth a small fortune.


425
00:34:07.038 --> 00:34:10.940
And I'm willing to pay it.
It's that important to me.


426
00:34:10.942 --> 00:34:14.844
You've never really explained
what you're doing at your lab.


427
00:34:14.846 --> 00:34:18.514
I've never really explained to
anyone what I'm doing in my lab.


428
00:34:18.516 --> 00:34:20.516
It's top secret.

429
00:34:20.518 --> 00:34:23.720
And besides, most people aren't
intelligent enough to understand it.


430
00:34:23.722 --> 00:34:27.157
You'll let me in on it
someday, I hope?


431
00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:30.060
Once I do my breakthrough,
it will be in all the scientific journals.


432
00:34:30.062 --> 00:34:32.562
There will be a media frenzy.

433
00:34:32.564 --> 00:34:34.700
Guess I'll just
have to wait till then.


434
00:34:35.135 --> 00:34:36.635
You won't be disappointed.

435
00:34:37.636 --> 00:34:40.071
Well, good day, Dr. Roberts.

436
00:34:40.073 --> 00:34:42.876
Call me when you have
something... useful.


437
00:34:52.017 --> 00:34:53.953
[softly]
Albert, get back here.


438
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:57.123
Albert.

439
00:34:58.858 --> 00:35:01.560
[woman] Look at these.
Pretty scary, huh?


440
00:35:03.229 --> 00:35:04.929
Mommy, look.
A real dinosaur.


441
00:35:04.931 --> 00:35:05.964
[woman] Uh-huh.

442
00:35:05.966 --> 00:35:07.167
[shushing]

[recorded snarling]

444
00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:23.516
Bye-bye, dinosaur!

445
00:35:23.784 --> 00:35:26.620
Bye-bye, dinosaur. Come on.
Let's go get some lunch.

- [chitters]
- [all gasp]


447
00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:42.136
Excuse me.

448
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.618
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here.


449
00:35:58.586 --> 00:36:00.255
Is that
a new robotic dinosaur?


450
00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:02.691
I just work here.

451
00:36:27.283 --> 00:36:28.817
[squeals]

452
00:36:50.773 --> 00:36:51.808
Come on, Albert.

453
00:36:52.675 --> 00:36:54.344
It's okay. Come on.

454
00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:03.654
Albert! No!

455
00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:10.092
All right, everyone...
Please, stop, stop, stop.


456
00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:12.394
Please, stop right out here.
Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay.


457
00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.396
Let me get
right here in front.


458
00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:17.899
Okay, all eyes on me! Now we've
seen some interesting things inside.


459
00:37:17.901 --> 00:37:20.435
Now, we'll explore
the gardens outside.


460
00:37:20.437 --> 00:37:21.970
I will remind you all
while we're out here,


461
00:37:21.972 --> 00:37:23.972
no running,
no pushing, no shoving.


462
00:37:23.974 --> 00:37:24.875
Please do not...

463
00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.211
act like that guy.

464
00:37:28.213 --> 00:37:29.945
Do not forget who you are.
All right?


465
00:37:29.947 --> 00:37:31.180
We'll meet for lunch
in 30 minutes.


466
00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.850
Does everyone have
a sack lunch?


467
00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:36.888
Somebody have an extra?
Somebody left mine on bus.


468
00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:27.140
[snarls]

469
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:44.392
I got you.

470
00:38:45.126 --> 00:38:46.126
You're safe.

471
00:38:58.905 --> 00:39:01.241
Hello. What's in that bag?

472
00:39:03.277 --> 00:39:04.443
Nothing.

473
00:39:04.445 --> 00:39:06.347
Oh, just let me take
a little look.


474
00:39:20.161 --> 00:39:21.961
[dialing]

475
00:39:21.963 --> 00:39:23.996
[line ringing]

476
00:39:23.998 --> 00:39:25.334
Have Site B up and running.

477
00:39:26.134 --> 00:39:27.302
I may be onto something.

478
00:39:34.175 --> 00:39:36.844
- [faint thudding]
- [groans]


479
00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:38.279
Man, Albert.

00:39:41.383 --> 00:39:43.751
With all this running around,
you must be hungry.

I know I am.

00:39:48.824 --> 00:39:50.859
Hold on.
I'll get us something to eat.

I don't know what to feed you.

I don't know what kind
of dinosaur you are.

Nah.

00:41:14.211 --> 00:41:15.511
I'm sorry.

492
00:41:15.513 --> 00:41:17.114
He's never acted
like this before.

I... I don't know
what's got into him.

No, don't touch it.
Just be glad it wasn't the salsa.


510

- Dude, I'm really in a rush.
- Dude, I used to skate.

What kind of wheels
are those?

- Yeah!

Oh, no!

All right, now, sir, you know it's
illegal to fire a gun in town, right?


526
00:44:53.171 --> 00:44:54.573
That thing tried to kill me!

527
00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.608
It's dangerous.

528
00:44:56.842 --> 00:44:58.308
All right.
Well, just relax, okay?


529
00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.176
We're gonna take it
down to the station.


530
00:45:00.178 --> 00:45:01.379
We'll find out what it is
and where it came from, okay?


531
00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:02.582
Just take it easy.

What the heck do you think
this thing is?

I don't know.

534
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:10.420
Looks like
a giant lizard to me.


535
00:45:10.422 --> 00:45:11.590
A giant lizard?

536
00:45:13.258 --> 00:45:14.159
Yeah.

537
00:45:14.994 --> 00:45:16.294
It probably escaped
from the zoo.


538
00:45:17.195 --> 00:45:18.698
I bet they don't even
know it's gone.


539
00:45:19.564 --> 00:45:20.800
I'm gonna call Dr. Jost.

540
00:45:21.333 --> 00:45:23.469
He's the big reptile
expert around here.


541
00:45:25.371 --> 00:45:26.706
I'll ask him
if it's poisonous.

Dr. Jost? Captain Williams.

Yeah, we found this thing I
think you might be interested in.

- A lizard.

Really?

Are you positive?

547
00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.695
No! No, no,
I'm sure it's harmless.

Yes, we're on our way.

at the museum.

I'm here for
a school research project.

Uh. yeah.

All right.

You take care.
Good luck on your project.


566
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.777
Breaks my heart to see a
creature such as that in a cage.

Sorry, what?

568
00:47:13.282 --> 00:47:14.383
The big fella.

569
00:47:14.784 --> 00:47:17.352
He should not be in a cage.

570
00:47:17.754 --> 00:47:19.354
Have we met before?

571
00:47:20.924 --> 00:47:23.693
- Do I know you?
- I don't believe so.


572
00:47:24.294 --> 00:47:26.963
I can't imagine how our paths
would have crossed.

Blend in.

575
00:47:31.902 --> 00:47:33.937
You just look like a man
I've recently met.


576
00:47:35.004 --> 00:47:38.673
Um, never mind.
I'm just confused right now.


577
00:47:38.675 --> 00:47:41.678
Ah. That's all right.
I get that way myself sometimes.


578
00:47:42.812 --> 00:47:45.882
The... big fella in there,
he's a friend of yours?


579
00:47:46.716 --> 00:47:50.020
Yeah. He ran away
and got caught.


580
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.355
The city is no place
for someone like that.


581
00:47:54.357 --> 00:47:56.326
He needs space.

582
00:47:56.527 --> 00:48:00.263
You should take him
outta here.


583
00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:05.834
I imagine he would love to
roam free in the woods, or...


584
00:48:05.836 --> 00:48:08.940
Or run in open fields
where there's no people.


585
00:48:09.573 --> 00:48:10.742
Where he could be safe.

586
00:48:11.609 --> 00:48:14.345
He needs to be free.

587
00:48:16.548 --> 00:48:17.947
- That's it!
- Yeah.


588
00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:20.418
- Thanks.
- So, what are you gonna do now?


589
00:48:23.053 --> 00:48:23.954
I don't know.

590
00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:35.498
Has that thing
always been that huge?


591
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.068
[woman] I've never seen
anything like it.


592
00:48:38.136 --> 00:48:40.470
When's Dr. Jost getting here?

593
00:48:40.472 --> 00:48:41.473
I don't know.

594
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.373
I just want it out of here.

Come on, come on, come on.
I'm a busy man.


600
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.936
- How can I help you, sir?
- I can't believe it!


601
00:49:10.502 --> 00:49:12.805
Yeah. That's one big lizard.

602
00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:15.007
Yes. Lizard.

603
00:49:15.875 --> 00:49:17.675
My name is Dr. Jost.

I specialize in rare creatures
such as these.


605
00:49:20.012 --> 00:49:22.680
I was contacted by your
superior, Captain Williams,


606
00:49:22.682 --> 00:49:24.884
to come and retrieve
our missing lizard.


607
00:49:26.086 --> 00:49:28.654
Don't do anything stupid.
Just wait.


608
00:49:29.056 --> 00:49:30.922
Dr. Jost,
I am so glad to see you.


609
00:49:30.924 --> 00:49:32.791
I can't wait to get
this thing out of here.

thank you for your cooperation.

It's a good thing
you called me.

00:50:58.248 --> 00:50:59.646
What do you mean?

619
00:50:59.648 --> 00:51:01.483
A creature like this,
anything could happen. Thank you, Captain.


620
00:51:01.952 --> 00:51:03.519
Let me know
if you need anything else.


621
00:51:03.887 --> 00:51:04.788
Okay, let's go.

622
00:51:06.022 --> 00:51:07.057
What do I do?

623
00:51:09.192 --> 00:51:10.527
I'm going to help him.

624
00:51:26.577 --> 00:51:28.479
We need to get
your friend back, kid.


625
00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:29.880
How?

626
00:51:34.218 --> 00:51:35.717
I know where
they're taking him.


627
00:51:35.719 --> 00:51:36.853
Seriously?

628
00:51:37.121 --> 00:51:38.089
Mmm.

629
00:51:39.256 --> 00:51:40.757
I won't let you down, Albert.

630
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:47.098
[Dr. Jost] So is everything
up and running?


631
00:51:48.299 --> 00:51:49.266
Good.

632
00:51:50.534 --> 00:51:53.004
Tell everyone I have a big
surprise for them when we arrive.


633
00:51:53.971 --> 00:51:54.972
Yes.

634
00:51:55.573 --> 00:51:58.210
Oh, and I need extra guards
patrolling the area.


635
00:51:59.744 --> 00:52:00.644
Thank you.

636
00:52:02.714 --> 00:52:05.181
Doctor, are you worried about
that kid snooping around?


637
00:52:05.183 --> 00:52:06.852
I'm not worried
about anything.


638
00:52:07.819 --> 00:52:11.623
We may never have another
chance like this. Besides...


639
00:52:12.225 --> 00:52:14.191
What can he do?

00:52:14.193 --> 00:52:15.861
He doesn't know where we're
going or how to get there.


641
00:52:16.195 --> 00:52:17.230
What can he do?

642
00:52:18.364 --> 00:52:21.297
- I don't know. Tell someone...
- Who's he going to tell?


643
00:52:21.299 --> 00:52:23.068
His parents? The police?

644
00:52:24.535 --> 00:52:27.272
No one's going to believe there's a
living, breathing dinosaur around.


645
00:52:27.939 --> 00:52:30.809
There's nothing
he can do to me now.


646
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:35.747
You hear me?
You're on your own now.


647
00:52:36.182 --> 00:52:37.816
You belong to me.

648
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:41.821
And with your help,
I shall make many, many more.


649
00:52:45.324 --> 00:52:49.662
You're going to make me very wealthy
and famous, my prehistoric friend.


650
00:52:51.898 --> 00:52:53.933
Shame you won't be
alive to see it.


651
00:52:56.904 --> 00:53:00.606
- Where are they taking him?
- Out, into the forest.


652
00:53:01.008 --> 00:53:03.277
They have a facility there
and a lab.


653
00:53:03.977 --> 00:53:05.079
In the forest?

654
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.215
How are we going to get
all the way out there?


655
00:53:09.816 --> 00:53:13.153
I can't ride my board that far.
It will take till tomorrow.


656
00:53:13.686 --> 00:53:15.055
By then it would be too late.

657
00:53:15.721 --> 00:53:16.988
Don't worry.
We'll get you there.


658
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:18.824
- Come on.
- But how?


659
00:53:18.826 --> 00:53:20.694
I'll show you. Don't worry!

660
00:53:21.361 --> 00:53:22.696
Is this your house?

661
00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:28.102
What...

662
00:53:28.902 --> 00:53:29.837
Hey!

663
00:53:31.839 --> 00:53:32.739
Wait!

664
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:38.079
[engine powers on]

665
00:53:42.317 --> 00:53:43.218
Whoa!

666
00:53:51.826 --> 00:53:52.827
What do you think?

667
00:53:53.195 --> 00:53:56.664
This is awesome!

668
00:53:57.698 --> 00:54:00.201
As you can see,
I like to recycle.


669
00:54:00.702 --> 00:54:02.201
Is this thing street-legal?

670
00:54:02.203 --> 00:54:04.270
Of course it is.

671
00:54:04.272 --> 00:54:05.974
It's got everything required to
be on the street. It's got...


672
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:08.943
headlights and blinkers and...

673
00:54:09.445 --> 00:54:12.079
Taillights, and a license
plate, and a horn.


674
00:54:12.081 --> 00:54:13.280
[horn toots]

675
00:54:13.282 --> 00:54:14.884
We are good to go.

676
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:17.219
What about a license
to drive?


677
00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:31.268
[laughs]

678
00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:32.969
What?

679
00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:36.206
The flash startled me.

680
00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.942
Ah. Here.
Put this on and get in.


681
00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:40.110
Let's go.

682
00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.918
[chuckles]

683
00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:51.687
I hope this time works
better than last time.


684
00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.723
This time?
What happened last time?


685
00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:59.729
Let's just say this thing used to
look a little nicer than it does now.


686
00:55:05.936 --> 00:55:07.804
[both laughing]

687
00:55:11.108 --> 00:55:13.444
- This is so cool!
- It is!


688
00:55:15.313 --> 00:55:16.981
How do you know
where you're going?


689
00:55:17.949 --> 00:55:19.116
Ah.

690
00:55:26.158 --> 00:55:27.992
Whoa! Keep your eyes
on the road.


691
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.760
I can't see. I...

692
00:55:30.229 --> 00:55:33.864
I can't see with it like that.
Hold on! Let me see...


693
00:55:35.433 --> 00:55:37.301
[nervous chuckle]

694
00:55:38.102 --> 00:55:39.036
Now what?

695
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:40.803
We'll do it
the old-fashioned way.


696
00:55:40.805 --> 00:55:43.375
We'll navigate
by the stars and the moon!


697
00:55:44.443 --> 00:55:45.977
It's daytime!

698
00:55:48.981 --> 00:55:50.349
Everybody's a critic.

699
00:56:04.863 --> 00:56:05.764
Chris?

700
00:56:11.604 --> 00:56:13.072
I must be working too hard.

701
00:56:14.207 --> 00:56:15.275
I'm seeing things.

702
00:56:15.842 --> 00:56:16.907
[honking]

703
00:56:16.909 --> 00:56:18.911
Okay. Sorry. Sorry.

704
00:56:23.148 --> 00:56:25.118
- That was my dad!
- That's nice.


705
00:56:25.618 --> 00:56:28.921
No! I'll be grounded
until I'm 30 if he saw me.


706
00:56:29.355 --> 00:56:31.055
You should stay home
with your parents


707
00:56:31.057 --> 00:56:32.925
as long as you can,
that's what I always say.


708
00:56:36.162 --> 00:56:37.397
Next stop, Albert!

709
00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.593
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?


710
00:57:07.595 --> 00:57:10.130
Gather 'round, gather 'round.

711
00:57:12.433 --> 00:57:15.537
I have made the discovery
of a lifetime.


712
00:57:16.904 --> 00:57:20.342
Instead of studying history,
we are making it.


713
00:57:21.476 --> 00:57:24.079
Now, every good team
needs a great leader.


714
00:57:24.679 --> 00:57:27.282
In this case... Me.
[clears throat]


715
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:30.116
Today, every scientist
will know my name


716
00:57:30.118 --> 00:57:32.954
and give the acknowledgment
and recognition that I...


717
00:57:34.055 --> 00:57:35.924
that we deserve.

718
00:57:37.025 --> 00:57:39.027
Without further ado,
I give you...


719
00:57:39.928 --> 00:57:41.630
a living dinosaur.

720
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.079
[whines]

721
00:58:03.552 --> 00:58:06.353
Well, yes, yes, yes. I know.

722
00:58:06.355 --> 00:58:08.322
It's very impressive.

723
00:58:08.324 --> 00:58:10.493
But come on,
we have important research to do!


724
00:58:18.702 --> 00:58:19.935
[brakes screech]

725
00:58:22.272 --> 00:58:23.273
Which way now?

726
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:27.043
You said you knew
where they were taking Albert.


727
00:58:33.116 --> 00:58:34.050
This way.

728
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.095
[laughs]

729
00:58:45.462 --> 00:58:46.528
Hold on.

730
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.365
Uh-huh.

731
00:58:48.699 --> 00:58:50.098
[powering up]

[screams]

733
00:58:57.275 --> 00:59:01.143
Slow down!

734
00:59:01.145 --> 00:59:02.613
Good idea!

735
00:59:04.482 --> 00:59:05.483
[powers down]

736
00:59:08.687 --> 00:59:09.588
[both scream]

737
00:59:13.759 --> 00:59:15.661
- That was close!
- Too close!


738
00:59:20.032 --> 00:59:22.065
I got good news
and bad news.


739
00:59:22.067 --> 00:59:23.700
Uh-huh.

740
00:59:23.702 --> 00:59:25.404
The good news is we're
making really good time!


741
00:59:26.371 --> 00:59:28.104
[groans]

742
00:59:28.106 --> 00:59:30.242
- What's the bad news?
- We don't have any brakes!


743
00:59:30.442 --> 00:59:31.478
What?

744
00:59:32.544 --> 00:59:33.612
[screams]

745
00:59:35.146 --> 00:59:36.613
Don't you have
an emergency brake?


746
00:59:36.615 --> 00:59:38.584
Yeah, it's here somewhere.

747
00:59:39.084 --> 00:59:42.654
- Like a lever?
- No, it's more like an anchor.


748
00:59:44.389 --> 00:59:45.290
Look!

749
00:59:46.225 --> 00:59:47.092
Here it is!

750
00:59:47.594 --> 00:59:49.127
Great! [chuckles]

751
00:59:49.461 --> 00:59:50.530
Hold on!

[clanking]

753
00:59:58.404 --> 01:00:00.240
You didn't tie it down?

754
01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.309
[groans] I knew
I forgot something!


755
01:00:04.177 --> 01:00:07.313
If I only had my tools,
I could fix the brakes!


756
01:00:08.448 --> 01:00:09.517
Oh!

757
01:00:11.084 --> 01:00:12.317
Ah! Here!

758
01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:14.288
Thank you.
I'll be right back.


759
01:00:15.456 --> 01:00:18.092

John and Carrie
will never believe this!


764
01:00:36.377 --> 01:00:37.678
I think that went
pretty well...


765
01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:41.649
considering it's only the
second time I've ever driven.


766
01:00:43.785 --> 01:00:44.686
What?

767
01:00:52.661 --> 01:00:55.130
[indistinct chatter]

[machinery beeping]

- Who are those people?
- Shh.

01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:26.361
- How are we going to get in?
- Leave it to me.


771
01:01:27.697 --> 01:01:29.832
I still have a few tricks
up my sleeve.


772
01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:33.235
How will I know when to go?

773
01:01:33.703 --> 01:01:34.604
You'll know.

774
01:01:35.738 --> 01:01:36.639
Stay here.

775
01:01:47.584 --> 01:01:49.252
You're not supposed
to be here.


776

[coughs]

777
01:02:26.557 --> 01:02:27.859
I didn't disappear, did I?

778
01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:56.521
Hey, hey, fellas.
Take it easy. Come on.

Careful with
the clothing here.

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:03.660
- We can't have this!
- You're right.


782
01:03:03.662 --> 01:03:05.931
It took me years
to refine this look.


783
01:03:06.899 --> 01:03:07.800
Get rid of him.

784
01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:09.401
- But...
- [Dr. Jost] Go on.

Oh, no.

787
01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.500
Albert's gotta be
here somewhere.

[Albert chitters]

I'm glad to see you, too.

793
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.905
We gotta get you
out of here.

- [grunts]
- Shh.


795
01:05:58.208 --> 01:05:59.474
Not so loud.

796
01:05:59.476 --> 01:06:00.611
They might hear you.

01:06:03.181 --> 01:06:04.648
Hey, you aren't
going anywhere.

What the...

01:06:13.057 --> 01:06:14.125
That's how it's done.

Come on, boy,
don't just stand there!

01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:18.930
Albert's locked up.

804
01:06:27.206 --> 01:06:29.440
Time for
an old-school getaway.


805
01:06:33.478 --> 01:06:35.045
[laughs]

806
01:06:35.047 --> 01:06:37.983
I don't know how you got away,
but your luck just ran out.


807
01:06:39.018 --> 01:06:39.985
Lock everyone up!

808
01:06:40.719 --> 01:06:43.656
You can't do that!
I'm just a kid!


809
01:06:44.156 --> 01:06:46.025
I make the rules here.

810
01:06:46.758 --> 01:06:48.060
Do as I say, lock them up!

811
01:06:53.565 --> 01:06:54.600
Run!

812
01:06:58.971 --> 01:07:00.472
[roars]

813
01:07:09.215 --> 01:07:10.884
There's no need
to feel threatened.


814
01:07:12.819 --> 01:07:16.790
There's no reason to be scared of a
bum, a kid and his pet.


815
01:07:18.525 --> 01:07:19.726
[growls]

[whimpers]

819
01:07:34.174 --> 01:07:35.742
No! No, no, no!

01:07:38.279 --> 01:07:40.114
[roars]

821
01:07:56.298 --> 01:07:58.065
Get back here, you cowards!

822
01:08:02.837 --> 01:08:05.007
Get after them!
We can't let them get away!


823
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.101
This way.

824
01:09:10.973 --> 01:09:12.809
- I think we can lose them in here.
- Okay.


825
01:09:20.217 --> 01:09:21.919
[roars]

826
01:09:25.155 --> 01:09:26.056
That way.

827
01:09:34.098 --> 01:09:34.998
This way.

828
01:09:40.138 --> 01:09:41.039
Albert!

829
01:09:41.705 --> 01:09:43.108
[snarls]

830
01:09:45.076 --> 01:09:46.177
Albert!

831
01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:49.013
Albert!

832
01:09:49.747 --> 01:09:50.648
Albert.

833
01:10:02.794 --> 01:10:04.060
Okay, let's split up.

834
01:10:04.062 --> 01:10:05.697
You two, that way.
You, with me.


835
01:10:10.168 --> 01:10:11.301
[whines]

836
01:10:11.303 --> 01:10:14.406
Hey, hey.
It's okay, it's okay.


837
01:10:15.207 --> 01:10:16.909
Come on. Follow me.

838
01:10:22.748 --> 01:10:23.816
Come on.

839
01:10:31.857 --> 01:10:32.858
Don't know.

840
01:10:34.494 --> 01:10:35.728
Come on out, kid!

841
01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:39.399
We know you're here somewhere.

842
01:10:41.401 --> 01:10:43.803
Come on out and you won't get
hurt, I promise.


843
01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:46.406
All we want is the dinosaur.

844
01:10:49.008 --> 01:10:49.909
Hey.

845
01:10:53.846 --> 01:10:55.681
Think about it, kid.
You could be rich.


846
01:10:56.516 --> 01:10:59.853
You and your family will never
have to worry about money again.


847
01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.389
We'll take good care
of Albert. I promise.


848
01:11:21.142 --> 01:11:22.210
What do you say, kid?

849
01:11:24.145 --> 01:11:25.780
I'll take good care of Albert.

850
01:11:27.114 --> 01:11:28.983
Just as soon as
I take care of you.


851
01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:52.740
[gasps]

852
01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:46.263
- They're catching up.
- Over here.


853
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.549
[raspy breathing]

854
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:06.217
Shh.

855
01:13:07.152 --> 01:13:08.617
I thought I heard something.

856
01:13:08.619 --> 01:13:09.953
Shh.

857
01:13:30.241 --> 01:13:31.309
I think they're gone.

858
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:33.178
They went that way.

859
01:13:33.545 --> 01:13:35.013
Then let's go that way.

860
01:13:44.055 --> 01:13:45.890
Stop, stop, stop.

861
01:13:46.592 --> 01:13:48.060
We're going the wrong way.

862
01:13:57.102 --> 01:13:58.002
Which way?

863
01:13:59.372 --> 01:14:00.406
We need to split up.

864
01:14:02.073 --> 01:14:04.310
- We'll head off this way.
- That's not what I mean.


865
01:14:05.177 --> 01:14:06.911
You and I need
to go back to the city.


866
01:14:07.513 --> 01:14:09.582
Albert needs to go that way.

867
01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:12.918
No, I'm not letting him go.

868
01:14:13.152 --> 01:14:17.489
Chris, Dr. Jost will find him
if he stays with you.


869
01:14:17.491 --> 01:14:19.326
You understand that,
don't you?


870
01:14:20.427 --> 01:14:22.895
- He's my responsibility.
- You're right.


871
01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:26.431
But the only way to keep
him safe is to let him go.


872
01:14:26.433 --> 01:14:28.368
[whimpers]

873
01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:35.208
You're right.

874
01:14:43.117 --> 01:14:44.484
I don't want
to see you get hurt.


875
01:14:45.552 --> 01:14:46.520
You have to go.

876
01:14:49.089 --> 01:14:51.191
Go. Go to the forest.

877
01:14:52.325 --> 01:14:53.226
Go!

878
01:14:55.195 --> 01:14:57.964
Go! I don't want
to see you anymore.


879
01:15:08.543 --> 01:15:10.545
[Albert howls]

880
01:15:11.713 --> 01:15:12.980
Albert.

881
01:15:17.653 --> 01:15:18.554
I love you.

882
01:15:26.628 --> 01:15:27.629
Take care.

883
01:15:33.735 --> 01:15:34.736
He'll be all right.

884
01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:40.975
[clattering]

885
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:42.311
Let's go!

886
01:15:51.688 --> 01:15:53.188
[coughs]

887
01:16:16.347 --> 01:16:18.415
- I think we lost them.
- Now what?


888
01:16:18.849 --> 01:16:20.615
Now we get you home.

889
01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:21.784
[gun cocks]

890
01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:34.262
Told you we'd get you.

891
01:16:34.264 --> 01:16:36.132
- [grunts]
- Hold him.


892
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.370
And don't let him get away this time.
You think you can do that?


893
01:16:44.174 --> 01:16:47.175
- Where is Albert?
- Leave us alone.


894
01:16:47.177 --> 01:16:49.111
- Let us go!
- Tired of messing with you, kid.


895
01:16:49.113 --> 01:16:50.580
- Where's the dinosaur?
- Stop it!


896
01:16:50.582 --> 01:16:53.416
- Gone! Albert's gone!
- Where is he? Tell me!


897
01:16:53.418 --> 01:16:54.786
Take your hands off him!

898
01:16:55.787 --> 01:16:57.155
Where is he?

899
01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:00.356
Somewhere safe.

[siren chirps]

901
01:17:01.359 --> 01:17:03.261
Doctor! We need to leave.

902
01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:05.630
This is not over!

903
01:17:11.803 --> 01:17:12.704
Come on.

904
01:17:14.639 --> 01:17:16.775
- [whistling]
- [siren wails]


905
01:17:17.509 --> 01:17:18.543
Follow my lead.

906
01:17:26.284 --> 01:17:27.618
You two need help?

907
01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.789
No. No, sir.
I think we're good now.


908
01:17:30.556 --> 01:17:33.158
We were just taking a stroll
through the forest.


909
01:17:33.893 --> 01:17:38.464
Yeah, my... uncle and I just
got a little turned around.


910
01:17:38.898 --> 01:17:41.100
You never know
what you might see out here.


911
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.935
- You need a ride?
- No. No.


912
01:17:43.937 --> 01:17:47.473
No, I wouldn't want to stink
up the inside of your car.


913
01:17:48.307 --> 01:17:49.674
You don't smell that bad.

914
01:17:49.676 --> 01:17:51.277
I wasn't talking about me.

915
01:17:51.812 --> 01:17:53.345
Well, where are y'all headed?

916
01:17:53.347 --> 01:17:55.213
The city.

917
01:17:55.215 --> 01:17:57.583
Well, just keep going,
and this road will take you downtown.


918
01:17:58.618 --> 01:18:00.887
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thanks.


919
01:18:44.966 --> 01:18:46.299
You did good.

920
01:18:47.402 --> 01:18:50.203
- Thanks for the help.
- I was just tagging along.


921
01:18:53.941 --> 01:18:55.410
Will I ever see him again?

922
01:18:56.377 --> 01:18:57.278
Maybe.

923
01:19:00.281 --> 01:19:01.182
Probably.

924
01:19:04.787 --> 01:19:06.287
I'm sure you will.

925
01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.728
You run on now.

926
01:19:14.296 --> 01:19:16.331
I'm just going to
sit here for a while.


927
01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:18.534
Besides...

928
01:19:19.334 --> 01:19:20.970
you got school tomorrow,
remember?


929
01:19:21.938 --> 01:19:24.273
Oh, yeah. School.

930
01:19:25.274 --> 01:19:26.208
I almost forgot.

931
01:19:29.345 --> 01:19:30.613
Thanks again for the help.

932
01:19:35.317 --> 01:19:37.919
Chris! Where have you
been all day?


933
01:19:37.921 --> 01:19:39.887
- Where's Albert?
- Where is the dinosaur?


934
01:19:39.889 --> 01:19:41.789
- What happened?
- Albert's gone.


935
01:19:41.791 --> 01:19:42.959
Gone? Where is he?

936
01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:46.396
- He had to leave.
- What do you mean, he had to leave?


937
01:19:46.663 --> 01:19:47.964
My new friend right here...

938
01:19:48.832 --> 01:19:51.468
helped me get Albert
to safety.


939
01:19:51.735 --> 01:19:54.504
- Dude, there's no one there.
- He was right here.


940
01:19:55.572 --> 01:19:57.540
I... I never got his name.

941
01:19:58.675 --> 01:20:01.411
Sorry.
We didn't see anyone.


942
01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:05.547
Meet me at my house.

943
01:20:05.549 --> 01:20:07.916
I'll catch up with you
and tell you everything.


944
01:20:07.918 --> 01:20:08.986
I'll be right behind.

945
01:20:09.653 --> 01:20:11.455
- Don't take too long.
- I won't.


946
01:20:29.907 --> 01:20:30.941
You okay?

947
01:20:31.442 --> 01:20:32.674
Yeah.

948
01:20:32.676 --> 01:20:33.577
Perfect.

949
01:20:34.345 --> 01:20:35.379
You two go ahead.

950
01:20:37.015 --> 01:20:39.416
See you later.
Can't wait to hear all about it.


951
01:21:10.816 --> 01:21:11.817
Be safe, Albert.
