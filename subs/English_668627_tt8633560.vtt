Hey, baby, wake up.

- So Ashley,
tell us about this.


43
00:03:33.414 --> 00:03:35.112
You were in the parking lot

44
00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:37.070
in broad daylight
at the grocery store,


45
00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:39.203
and you get kidnapped,
and then you're held


46
00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:40.813
for several days
against your will


47
00:03:40.856 --> 00:03:42.423
out in this old barn.

48
00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:44.338
What is going
through your mind


49
00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:45.905
while you're in captivity?

50
00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:48.603
- I just told myself
that I would survive


51
00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:50.605
and that there was no way
I was giving my life


52
00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:52.390
or my power over to this man.

53
00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.348
- Wow, that's amazing.

54
00:03:54.392 --> 00:03:56.089
Now, I understand part
of this survival story


55
00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:58.004
is connected
to a guitar pick?


56
00:03:58.048 --> 00:03:59.875
- Yes. I had a guitar pick
in my pocket


57
00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.573
because I was taking
guitar lessons at the time.


58
00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.096
- I love the guitar.

59
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.793
- And I waited for
an opportunity


60
00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:07.231
for Andy to nod off,
and when he did,


61
00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:08.754
I used the pick
to cut through the ropes


62
00:04:08.797 --> 00:04:10.277
that he had tied
my hands and feet with,


63
00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:12.671
and then
I just ran like hell.


64
00:04:12.714 --> 00:04:14.542
- Wow, and I see you actually
brought the guitar.


65
00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.501
- Yeah, do you want to--
do you want to hear a song?


66
00:04:16.544 --> 00:04:18.329
- No. No, no, no, no,

67
00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:20.505
but I want to thank you
so much for coming,


68
00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:22.811
and I hope you'll come back
with that guitar and the pick.


69
00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:25.292
- Oh, crap.
- ...and tell us--


70
00:04:27.207 --> 00:04:30.776
- And welcome back.
This is DJ Coyote Carl.


71
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.214
On KRPP,
spinning on the nines,


72
00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:35.389
bringing you
all of today's hits


73
00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:36.999
and the freshest of sounds

74
00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:39.524
that your Midwestern
ears can handle.


75
00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:40.916
- Nice.

76
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.831
- You throw like a girl.

77
00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.268
- What do you mean,
throw like a girl?


78
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:45.486
That was a swish.

79
00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:48.315
- Bathsheba,
we talked about this.


80
00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:50.100
Mind your manners.

81
00:04:50.143 --> 00:04:52.232
- Not so bad yourself,
Bathsheba.


82
00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:54.887
- Want to play
cornhole toss, Susan?


83
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.107
- I'm super busy right now,
Laney.


84
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.847
I don't have time
to toss anything,


85
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:01.111
but your bird is pretty.

86
00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:03.939
- Hey, Susan, you want
to hear a joke?


87
00:05:03.983 --> 00:05:05.332
- No, Leon, I
-I don't.

88
00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:07.073
I can't, I'm--

89
00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:08.814
I'm late for work.

90
00:05:08.857 --> 00:05:09.989
- Oh, where are
you working now?


91
00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:12.905
- Hmm?
Uh, at a florist.


92
00:05:12.948 --> 00:05:14.559
Kind of all-around, you know,

93
00:05:14.602 --> 00:05:17.779
party planning
and doing mergers,


94
00:05:17.823 --> 00:05:20.608
you know, things like that.

95
00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:23.133
I like your black--
I mean your bike.


96
00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:25.874
I know that that's a bike,

97
00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:28.268
and I know that
you are a black person.


98
00:05:28.312 --> 00:05:31.750
Um, I should bounce.
I'm gonna bounce.


99

- Hey, it's Cameron.

104
00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:53.337
- What do you want, a medal?

105
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.990

- Don't worry about it.

- Did you get Mom
a birthday present?


107
00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:58.124
- Not yet.

108
00:05:58.168 --> 00:05:59.212
- Well, her birthday
is on Monday.


109

What are you gonna get her?

110
00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:02.563

my name on your gift?


111
00:06:02.607 --> 00:06:03.956
- No.
- Why not?

113

on your gift


114
00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:08.352
like you did last year
with the comforter set?


115
00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:09.788
- I don't want to do it
this year.


116
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:10.832
- Why not?

117
00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:12.269
- Just get her
a fucking present.


118
00:06:12.312 --> 00:06:14.096
She'd really appreciate
something from you.


119
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.447
- Like she'd care.
- Oh, you two are impossible.


120
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.318
She wants those stackable
bowls in different colors.


121
00:06:18.362 --> 00:06:19.798
Get her those.
- Where do you even get--


122
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:21.365
- Figure it out.

123
00:06:21.408 --> 00:06:23.062
I've got seven EKGs to run
in the next 60 minutes,


124
00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:24.759
which is mathematically
impossible.


125
00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:27.632
- Yeah, well, I have eight.
- Eight what?


126
00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:29.068
- Don't worry about it.

- ♪ But I left you long ago

129
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.295
- Look at those.

130
00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:40.732
- What am I looking at?

131
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.299
- Those cowboy boots.

132
00:06:42.342 --> 00:06:44.301
Don't you love
those cowboy boots?


133
00:06:44.344 --> 00:06:47.652
- Oh, yeah,
those are good boots.


134
00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:50.698
- I just feel like if I had
a pair of cowboy boots,


135
00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:53.962
I'd be like--I don't know,
I'd be like, "Yes," you know?


136
00:06:54.006 --> 00:06:55.399
Everything--

137
00:06:55.442 --> 00:06:57.531
- Well, that's
'cause boots like that,


138
00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:00.186
you can dress them up,
super fancy.


139
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.492
You can dress them down,
super caj.


140
00:07:01.535 --> 00:07:02.710
That's the magic.

141
00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:04.625
- Exactly.
- Right?


142
00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.453
- How much do you think
they cost?


143
00:07:06.497 --> 00:07:08.499
- I don't know, those are,
like, $100, maybe more.


144
00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:09.848
- Hey, ladies.

145
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:11.458
- Hey.

146
00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:12.894
What's with the duct tape?

147
00:07:12.938 --> 00:07:14.940
- Ah, it's kinesiology tape.

148
00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:17.595
I busted up my shoulder
doing a keg toss in college,


149
00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:20.206
but it was for charity, so it's
kind of a badge of honor.


150
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.950
You almost done with that?

151
00:07:24.993 --> 00:07:26.473
- Yeah.
Did you want some?


152
00:07:26.517 --> 00:07:28.910
- Ah. The bike.

153
00:07:28.954 --> 00:07:32.566
- Oh, yeah, I'm just--

154
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:36.875
Oh.

155
00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:39.356
Ugh.
Whew, that was intense.


156
00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.401
- You got a good final burn
in there, huh?


157
00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:43.447
- Yeah, thanks.
Well, good luck.


158
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.318
- Sweet, thanks.

159
00:07:45.362 --> 00:07:48.408
- Hey, I think he likes you.

160
00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:50.889
- The duct tape guy?
- Yeah.


161
00:07:50.932 --> 00:07:53.239
- He doesn't even know my name.
- Did you see him wink at you?


162
00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:54.545
- He totally winked.

163
00:07:54.588 --> 00:07:55.894
- Corrin, he was blinking.

164
00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:27.360
Mm.

165
00:08:30.363 --> 00:08:34.889
- Ahhh!

166
00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:36.587
What the fuck, Mom?

167
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.153
- You scared the shit
out of me!


168
00:08:38.197 --> 00:08:39.546
- Your scream could
break glass!


169
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.332
I mean, who walks
into somebody's house


170
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:44.203
and just starts eating chips?

171
00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:46.510
- It's my house too.
I grew up here, remember?


172
00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:48.163
- Would you get
the humidifier down


173
00:08:48.207 --> 00:08:50.122
from the hallway closet for me?

174
00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:53.386
- Why can't you do it yourself?
- 'Cause I'm 66 and fucked.


175
00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:56.650
- Okay, can I have
some money, then?


176
00:08:56.694 --> 00:08:59.131
- For getting
the humidifier down?


177
00:09:00.175 --> 00:09:02.743
- No, rent is due
on the first,


178
00:09:02.787 --> 00:09:05.224
and my unemployment check
doesn't come until the eighth.


179
00:09:05.267 --> 00:09:07.269
- Of course.

180
00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:09.141
Oh, that's the same look
your father gave me


181
00:09:09.184 --> 00:09:11.099
right before he left us
for that lady dentist.


182
00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:12.753
Then he went and died,

183
00:09:12.797 --> 00:09:14.581
as if that was supposed
to make up for it.


184
00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:16.931
- Ugh, here we go.
- You know what's funny?


185
00:09:16.975 --> 00:09:18.977
- You're the one who made
the dentist appointment?


186
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.588
- Well, what else was
I supposed to do?


187
00:09:21.632 --> 00:09:24.199
His breath was so bad,
it was like he had an asshole


188
00:09:24.243 --> 00:09:26.288
where his mouth
was supposed to be.


189
00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.334
If I'd been willing
to kiss a little ass,


190
00:09:28.378 --> 00:09:31.424
he'd probably still be around.

191
00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:32.817
Oh, did I tell you
what Meredith said?


192
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.514
- Who's Meredith?

193
00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:37.299
- The woman who cuts
the chicken at the Jewel-Osco.


194
00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.567
You need to shave
your legs, Susan.


195
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.048
She heard me say that my son
was a physician's assistant.


196
00:09:47.092 --> 00:09:49.311
- Who were you
telling that to?


197
00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.835
- Oh, I don't know,
someone else in line.


198
00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:53.359
- Wait, what?
Someone in line?


199
00:09:53.403 --> 00:09:55.753
So you just tell people
you're standing next to in line


200
00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.711
that your son Cameron's
a physician's assistant?


201
00:09:57.755 --> 00:09:58.886
- I don't remember.

202
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.714
Anyway, Meredith said,

203
00:10:00.758 --> 00:10:02.673
"If he's a physician's
assistant,


204
00:10:02.716 --> 00:10:04.718
"he must be a genius
because physicians assistants


205
00:10:04.762 --> 00:10:06.590
"are even better
than doctors these days


206
00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:09.941
'cause they can't get sued
for malpractice."


207
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.422
- I'm pretty sure he's just
too stupid to be a doctor.


208
00:10:14.728 --> 00:10:16.991
Cameron says...

209
00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:18.558
that the reason
I still have this cough


210
00:10:18.602 --> 00:10:20.734
is 'cause it's
too dry in here.


211
00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:27.611
She asked me
about my daughter.


212
00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:29.569
- Who did?
- Meredith.


213
00:10:29.613 --> 00:10:31.136
- Who?

214
00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:33.181
- I told her
you just lost your job.


215
00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:35.619
- Who?
- You did.


216
00:10:35.662 --> 00:10:37.577
- Did what?
- You lost your job.


217
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:39.840
- What?
- You lost your job!


218
00:10:39.884 --> 00:10:41.712
- 'Cause the flower company
went out of business!


219
00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:44.149
- Cameron just sent me flowers
from there two weeks ago.


220
00:10:44.192 --> 00:10:46.499
- Well, my department
went out of business.


221
00:10:46.543 --> 00:10:49.328
- I thought you were
in delivery!


222
00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:53.027
- I was in, uh, rose nutrition.
Where's your purse?


223
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:55.203
- On the kitchen table.

224
00:10:59.512 --> 00:11:02.297
I expect you pay me back
this time!


225
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:04.256
Oh.

226
00:11:07.607 --> 00:11:09.566
Why'd you turn
the humidifier off?


227
00:11:09.609 --> 00:11:11.568
- The yelling was
making me nauseous.


228
00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:13.004
I'll plug it back in
when I leave.


229
00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:14.571
- Uh-huh.

230
00:11:17.574 --> 00:11:19.532
There you go.

231
00:11:19.576 --> 00:11:21.839
Your father could never
keep a job either.


232
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.233
You want some tea?

233
00:11:25.277 --> 00:11:27.409
- I'll see you for
your birthday on Monday.


234
00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:31.152
- You know,
if it was up to me,


235
00:11:31.196 --> 00:11:33.285
I wouldn't celebrate
my birthday,


236
00:11:33.328 --> 00:11:36.506
but Cameron says it's
important to celebrate me.


237
00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:38.072
- Bye, Mom.
- What?


238
00:12:13.543 --> 00:12:14.848
- ♪ Hey

239
00:12:18.373 --> 00:12:20.158
- Attention,
Kmart shoppers,


240
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:23.161
have you tried
our online shopping?


241
00:12:23.204 --> 00:12:25.729
If your shopping list won't
fit into your to-do list...


242
00:12:25.772 --> 00:12:27.426
- Hey, Susan.

243
00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:30.429
- Hey, Velvet.
You look tired.


244
00:12:30.472 --> 00:12:32.605
- I was in Cancun
on my annual girls' trip


245
00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:34.694
with a few
of my old sorority sisters.


246
00:12:34.738 --> 00:12:36.304
- That's why you're
so tan and tired.


247
00:12:36.348 --> 00:12:38.089
- It was a blast,

248
00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.830
and they just made me employee
of the month yesterday,


249
00:12:39.873 --> 00:12:41.440
so I'm getting a lot of calls.

250
00:12:41.483 --> 00:12:43.181
- Yeah, um,
I'm employee of the month


251
00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:44.530
at the flower shop
I work at, so...


252
00:12:44.574 --> 00:12:46.706
- And I got a $50 bonus.

253
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.142
- I get free tulips for a year.

254
00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:49.404
- Awesome.
I love tulips.


255
00:12:49.448 --> 00:12:50.710
It's mine
and my boyfriend's flower.


256
00:12:50.754 --> 00:12:51.798
We say it means love
without pressure.


257
00:12:51.842 --> 00:12:54.235
- Awesome.

258
00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:55.889
My phone's blowing up, so...

259
00:12:55.933 --> 00:12:57.238
- Yeah, I should probably
check mine.


260
00:12:57.282 --> 00:12:59.284
I'm waiting for a call
from Jackie Minns.


261
00:12:59.327 --> 00:13:01.025
- Jackie Minns who lived
across the street from you?


262
00:13:01.068 --> 00:13:02.983
You're still friends with her?
- She colors my hair.


263
00:13:03.027 --> 00:13:05.072
- Cool.

264
00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:06.552
I think I'll take them.

265
00:13:06.596 --> 00:13:09.250
- What?
- The boots.


266
00:13:09.294 --> 00:13:12.123
- These?
You should.


267
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.907
Boots make your legs
look super long.


268
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:16.127
They're not cheap.
- 104, right?


269
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.260
Plus 5.77% tax,
brings the total to 110 even.


270
00:13:19.304 --> 00:13:21.132
- Maybe.

271
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.700
Scooters are usually reserved
for disabled customers.


272
00:13:23.743 --> 00:13:26.616
- I know, it's not like I was
riding it around or anything.


273
00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:30.010
- So these--these aren't
your stackable bowls?


274
00:13:31.446 --> 00:13:32.926
- Nope.
- Cool.


275
00:13:34.754 --> 00:13:36.495
What size are you?

276
00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:39.367
- I'm a nine.
- I'm an eight.


277
00:13:54.992 --> 00:13:56.558
- Andy--

278
00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.299
- Boil your own
damn potatoes then.


279
00:13:58.343 --> 00:13:59.910
Nah, nah, nah,
I'm out of here.


280
00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:01.520
Make your own damn potatoes.

281
00:15:10.197 --> 00:15:12.069
- Cameron.

282
00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:13.766
Who is Mommy's
favorite little boy?


283
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.029
- Guys, guys, guys.
- Susan--


284
00:15:16.073 --> 00:15:17.552
- Susan come here.
Mary--


285
00:15:17.596 --> 00:15:19.337
- Got one.
- Don't stop taping.


286
00:15:20.947 --> 00:15:23.776
What is pi, Susan?
- Dad!


287
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.909
- What is pi?

288
00:15:25.952 --> 00:15:27.998
- Pi is the ratio
of a circle's circumference


289
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:29.564
to its diameter.

290
00:15:29.608 --> 00:15:31.218
Regardless of the size
of the circle,


291
00:15:31.262 --> 00:15:34.918
pi's always the same
number, 3.141592653589.


292
00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:37.790
- Mary, did you get that?
- I got it.


293
00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:40.314
I sure don't know
where you get your brains.


294
00:15:40.358 --> 00:15:42.795
- Oh, I hope
there's a job out there


295
00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:45.885
for a flute blower
who can dance.


296
00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:49.802
- Look, Mommy.
I'm drawing a rainbow.


297
00:16:01.683 --> 00:16:04.208
- "Your beauty should not come
from outward adornments,


298
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:07.820
"such as braided hair or
gold jewelry or fine clothes,


299
00:16:07.864 --> 00:16:10.214
"but from the inner disposition
of your heart,


300
00:16:10.257 --> 00:16:13.260
"the unfading beauty
of a gentle and quiet spirit,


301
00:16:13.304 --> 00:16:14.914
which is precious
in God's sight."


302
00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.177
Peter 3:3-4.

303
00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:19.832
- Yay.
- Yay!


304
00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:22.574
- Yes, love that.
- Happy birthday, Grandma.


305
00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:26.883
- Oh, my goodness.
I wonder what this could be.


306
00:16:26.926 --> 00:16:31.104
- We made it from a book.
- Oh, will you look at that?


307
00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:33.411
- It's a paper hedgehog.

308
00:16:33.454 --> 00:16:35.456
- And those
are fashion drawings.


309
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.852
- Oh.
Oh, how gorgeous.


310
00:16:39.896 --> 00:16:43.813
Will you make me a dress
like that to wear to church?


311
00:16:43.856 --> 00:16:47.207
- You're so talented, Jenika.
- You are too, Aunt Susan.


312
00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:49.296
- For two weeks she got
her homework done early


313
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.037
so she could finish
her presents for Grandma.


314
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:53.300
- That is so sweet.

315
00:16:53.344 --> 00:16:55.825
- Can I get you some more cake,
Mary, or some orange juice?


316
00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:57.870
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?


317
00:16:57.914 --> 00:16:59.741
Are you feeling okay?
You want me to rub your back?


318
00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:00.917
- She's fine, Wendy.

319
00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:03.876
Here, Mom.
- Oh.


320
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.575
- Open my gift, okay?
- Oh, look at that.


321
00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:11.014
Another art project.

322
00:17:11.057 --> 00:17:12.450
Look.

323
00:17:12.493 --> 00:17:14.278
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.


324
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:15.845
You know, if you're not gonna
give me a grandbaby,


325
00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:17.411
I think this is
the next best thing,


326
00:17:17.455 --> 00:17:20.632
one of these art projects.

327
00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:22.852
- All right, one more gift.

328
00:17:26.072 --> 00:17:28.683
So this is from
the three of us.


329
00:17:28.727 --> 00:17:30.424
- I decorated the envelope.

330
00:17:30.468 --> 00:17:32.209
- Jenika decorated
the envelope.


331
00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:33.950
- We wanted to do something
extra special


332
00:17:33.993 --> 00:17:35.821
for you this year, Mom.

333
00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:37.388
- Why, 'cause I'm so old?

334
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:40.391
- Oh, it is a privilege
to age, Mary.


335
00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:41.740
- She doesn't
like it that hard.


336
00:17:41.783 --> 00:17:44.612
- So we're all
going on a trip.


337
00:17:44.656 --> 00:17:47.702
- What? Toronto?
- Niagara Falls.


338
00:17:47.746 --> 00:17:49.400
- We're taking you
to Niagara Falls.


339
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:51.532
- Ohh!

340
00:17:53.317 --> 00:17:55.710
Leave it to Cameron.

341
00:17:55.754 --> 00:17:57.756
- Niagara Falls is
on my vision board.


342
00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:59.453
- You know, the deaf woman
at Walgreens,


343
00:17:59.497 --> 00:18:00.846
she says you can't
even look at the falls


344
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.282
without getting soaked.

345
00:18:02.326 --> 00:18:03.936
You have to wear raincoats.

346
00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.895
- That's right.
We saw that on the website.


347
00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:08.985
- I did an oral report on
the falls in the third grade.


348
00:18:09.028 --> 00:18:10.900
Yeah, I bet you didn't know
that the first person


349
00:18:10.943 --> 00:18:12.684
to go over the falls
in a barrel


350
00:18:12.727 --> 00:18:16.035
was 63-year-old schoolteacher
Annie Edson Taylor,


351
00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:18.037
and despite myths
to the contrary,


352
00:18:18.081 --> 00:18:19.952
it does not freeze
in the winter.


353
00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:22.781
- I do know that.
- Yeah?


354
00:18:22.824 --> 00:18:24.696
- Hmm.

355
00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.698
You're not going.

356
00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:30.876
- You said--

357
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.792
you said we're all
going on a trip.


358
00:18:33.835 --> 00:18:36.621
- All of us, not you.

359
00:18:36.664 --> 00:18:38.579
- You know, I'm going back
to Weight Watchers


360
00:18:38.623 --> 00:18:41.495
because I just saw on the news
that a woman was suing Delta


361
00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:44.324
'cause her fat got stuck
between two seats.


362
00:18:44.368 --> 00:18:46.065
- Nonsense, Mary.

363
00:18:46.109 --> 00:18:48.807
You're in terrific shape
for a woman your age.


364
00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.114
- Can't Aunt Susan
come too, Daddy?


365
00:18:51.157 --> 00:18:52.637
- No, we're not gonna
take Susan.


366
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.509
- Not this time, honey.
- Ugh!


367
00:18:55.553 --> 00:18:56.989
- I don't know
what's going on right now.


368
00:18:57.033 --> 00:18:58.730
- I'm not financing you.

369
00:18:58.773 --> 00:19:00.514
If you can pay
for your own airline ticket


370
00:19:00.558 --> 00:19:02.125
and buy a hotel room,

371
00:19:02.168 --> 00:19:03.517
then yeah,
you can come with us.


372
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:04.954
- That's everything.

373
00:19:04.997 --> 00:19:07.695
Then I'm just paying
for my own trip.


374
00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:10.437
- That's right.
That's how it works.


375
00:19:10.481 --> 00:19:12.396
- Mom, can I
borrow some money?


376
00:19:12.439 --> 00:19:14.267
- No, she's not giving you
any more money,


377
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:15.312
and you're not putting
your name


378
00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.009
on any more of my gifts,

379
00:19:17.053 --> 00:19:18.706
and none of us are giving you
any more free rides.


380
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.099
- This is Mom's birthday,
and you're ruining it.


381
00:19:20.143 --> 00:19:21.796
Why are you doing this?

382
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.363
- Yeah, it's Mom's birthday.

383
00:19:23.407 --> 00:19:25.235
Stop asking her for money.

384
00:19:25.278 --> 00:19:27.454
- What I think Cameron
is trying to say, Susan, is--


385
00:19:27.498 --> 00:19:29.587
and don't take
this personally,


386
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.851
but we've all worked
pretty hard for what we have,


387
00:19:32.894 --> 00:19:35.810
and I think what Cameron
is feeling


388
00:19:35.854 --> 00:19:38.509
is it's time
to end this pattern.


389
00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:41.120
- Nobody talks like that,
Wendy.


390
00:19:41.164 --> 00:19:42.252
Mom.

391
00:19:42.295 --> 00:19:43.383
- Mom.
- Mom.


392
00:19:43.427 --> 00:19:45.211
- Mom, tell her.
- Mom.


393
00:19:45.255 --> 00:19:47.431
- We talked about this.

394
00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:50.390
- You need to get a job, Susan.

395
00:19:50.434 --> 00:19:52.044
You need to get a job.

396
00:19:52.088 --> 00:19:54.655
- I had a job
at the flower shop,


397
00:19:54.699 --> 00:19:56.179
but it went out of business.

398
00:19:56.222 --> 00:19:58.007
- We were just there.
It's still open.


399
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.486
- My department went
out of business.


400
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.748
- Jenika, go get your iPad.

401
00:20:00.792 --> 00:20:02.098
- What about your job
at the carpet store?


402
00:20:02.141 --> 00:20:03.925
- It was dangerous.

403
00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:06.580
- What? How?
- Don't worry about it.


404
00:20:06.624 --> 00:20:08.974
- Okay, and the movie theater?

405
00:20:09.018 --> 00:20:10.541
- If you have a point, Cameron,

406
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:12.369
you better think long and hard
about making it.


407
00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:14.936
- I thought you were going
back to school online.


408
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.548
I thought that was
such a positive move.


409
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:19.767
- I was. I am.

410
00:20:19.811 --> 00:20:22.118
I--

411
00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:24.120
I've forgotten my password.

412
00:20:24.163 --> 00:20:26.861
- I can help you, Aunt Susan.
I'm good at computers.


413
00:20:26.905 --> 00:20:29.081
- Thanks, Jensy.
I--I would really like that.


414
00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.778
- Well, you're gonna have
to figure something out


415
00:20:30.822 --> 00:20:32.041
'cause Mom's
not gonna be around


416
00:20:32.084 --> 00:20:33.259
to take care
of you forever.


417
00:20:33.303 --> 00:20:34.565
You should be taking care
of her by now,


418
00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:35.783
not the other way around.

419
00:20:35.827 --> 00:20:36.915
- She doesn't need
taking care of.


420
00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.395
- Oh, yeah?

421
00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:40.049
Her blood pressure's
through the roof,


422
00:20:40.092 --> 00:20:41.572
she eats like shit,
she's still smoking,


423
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.008
and both Pop-Pop and Nan
died of heart attacks


424
00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:44.836
before they turned 70.

425
00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:46.359
Why do you think we're taking
her to Niagara Falls?


426
00:20:46.403 --> 00:20:47.578
We're trying to do
something special for her


427
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.796
while there's still time.

428
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.320
- Is Grandma gonna die?

429
00:20:50.363 --> 00:20:52.365
- Not today, honey.

430
00:20:52.409 --> 00:20:55.020
- I'm gonna
clean these plates.


431
00:20:55.064 --> 00:20:56.761
Don't want to leave
a dirty house


432
00:20:56.804 --> 00:20:58.415
in case I don't wake up
in the morning.


433
00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:00.678
- Mommy, I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't call me Mommy!


434
00:21:00.721 --> 00:21:02.201
- We'll help you, Mary.

435
00:21:02.245 --> 00:21:03.855
He didn't mean that
like it sounded.


436
00:21:03.898 --> 00:21:05.204
Jenika, come on,
let's go help Grandma


437
00:21:05.248 --> 00:21:07.032
clean up in the kitchen.

438
00:21:07.076 --> 00:21:08.773
- Fucking--
- Fucking moron.


439
00:21:11.254 --> 00:21:13.169
Fuck you.

440
00:21:29.185 --> 00:21:31.535
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you guys, that's too fast.


441
00:21:31.578 --> 00:21:33.928
Andy, Kyle, listen.
You never listen.


442
00:21:33.972 --> 00:21:36.279
Jesus, I'm gonna barf.
Stop it.


443
00:21:36.322 --> 00:21:38.803
Go find your sister
and push her on the thing.


444
00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:41.545
Sorry.
- It's okay.


445
00:21:43.199 --> 00:21:48.291
Sometimes I wish my family died
in a house fire, you know?


446
00:21:48.334 --> 00:21:51.424
Over Christmas,
caused by a short


447
00:21:51.468 --> 00:21:54.253
in a strand of lights
on the Christmas tree.


448
00:21:54.297 --> 00:21:56.168
- Yeah, but they don't make
those kind of lights anymore.


449
00:21:56.212 --> 00:21:57.648
- And they all died
of smoke inhalation.


450
00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:00.172
- It's not safe.
- Except for me, you know?


451
00:22:00.216 --> 00:22:02.783
I toddled out of the house
with a Barbie doll in my hand


452
00:22:02.827 --> 00:22:05.264
and a ponytail
on top of my head.


453
00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:08.398
I was a Christmas miracle,

454
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:09.964
and then everyone
in the country


455
00:22:10.008 --> 00:22:12.097
put money in a fund
for poor baby Susan.


456
00:22:12.141 --> 00:22:14.404
Wouldn't that be great?
- Yeah.


457
00:22:14.447 --> 00:22:16.232
- You know, if people asked
what I did for a living,


458
00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:18.103
I would just point
to my scars, you know,


459
00:22:18.147 --> 00:22:19.322
and just say,
"This is what I do."


460
00:22:19.365 --> 00:22:20.845
"Oh."

461
00:22:20.888 --> 00:22:22.368
- Then we could have
written a song.


462
00:22:22.412 --> 00:22:24.327
We could have called it
"Baby Susan," right?


463
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.459
- "Baby Susan."
- We could sell it on iTunes.


464
00:22:26.503 --> 00:22:28.069
- Why don't we have
a record deal?


465
00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.767
It's like, you turn on the TV,
it's like, "American Idol,"


466
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.464
it's like, "The Voice,"

467
00:22:31.508 --> 00:22:32.683
it's just like they're
giving away record deals.


468
00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:34.337
- Well, wait a sec,

469
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.555
'cause I was listening
to the radio today.


470
00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:37.296
- Coyote Carl?
- Yeah.


471
00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.561
both: I'd love to give
that DJ a BJ.


472
00:22:41.605 --> 00:22:43.694
- I would love that.
- Oh, my God.


473
00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:46.218
- Anyway, he said that there
was this talent show coming up


474
00:22:46.262 --> 00:22:48.220
and some kind of contest.

475
00:22:48.264 --> 00:22:50.701
- Are you effing serious?
- Yeah.


476
00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:52.790
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I am telling you.


477
00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:54.052
- This could change my life.

478
00:22:54.095 --> 00:22:55.836
We could win a lot of money,
I bet.


479
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.056
I need money so badly,
Corrin, like, yesterday.


480
00:22:58.099 --> 00:22:59.971
- You know, I saw at the DMV
that they were hiring


481
00:23:00.014 --> 00:23:01.755
a labor relations manager.

482
00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:03.061
Why don't you apply
for that job?


483
00:23:03.104 --> 00:23:04.410
- Really?
Does--


484
00:23:04.454 --> 00:23:05.933
- Oh, you probably need to know
what that is.


485
00:23:05.977 --> 00:23:07.718
I don't know what it is.

486
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:09.937
You probably also need
a clean driving record.


487
00:23:09.981 --> 00:23:12.070
- My car is cleaner
than my driving record.


488
00:23:13.941 --> 00:23:15.769
- I'll take you.
I mean, I'll take you


489
00:23:15.813 --> 00:23:17.858
to sign up and to apply
and to find out what it is.


490
00:23:17.902 --> 00:23:19.469
- No, that's okay.
- You wanna?


491
00:23:19.512 --> 00:23:22.036
- No, I'm just gonna keep
spinning for a while.


492
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.083
- Where's Vivi?
Boys, where is Vivi?


493
00:23:25.126 --> 00:23:26.606
Vivi?

494
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.391
Oh, there you are.
What do you have?


495
00:23:28.434 --> 00:23:30.001
- A stick.
- Oh, thanks, honey.


496
00:23:30.044 --> 00:23:31.655
That means
she has to go make.


497
00:23:31.698 --> 00:23:33.570
- Make what?
- She has to make number two.


498
00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:35.267
I never should have
taken her out of diapers.


499
00:23:45.277 --> 00:23:47.410
- Hello?
- Susan, it's Doug.


500
00:23:47.453 --> 00:23:49.325
- Hey, Doug.

501
00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:51.718
Listen, I dropped off rent
a few days ago.


502
00:23:51.762 --> 00:23:53.677
Don't say I didn't
'cause I did.


503
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.897
- Yeah, uh, $50 short
plus a $15 late fee.


504
00:23:56.941 --> 00:23:59.552
- What?
Oh, my God.


505
00:23:59.596 --> 00:24:02.773
Oh. Somebody must have
taken $50 out of the envelope.


506
00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:05.384
- $65, actually,

507
00:24:05.428 --> 00:24:07.299
- Well, I'm telling you
somebody stole--


508
00:24:09.258 --> 00:24:11.564
What the fart?

509
00:24:11.608 --> 00:24:12.957
What--

510
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.307
What the--

511
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:16.961
what is wrong with you?

512
00:24:17.004 --> 00:24:18.223
- Shoot, sorry.

513
00:24:18.267 --> 00:24:19.616
- Can you not see me
in that monster truck?


514
00:24:19.659 --> 00:24:20.747
- Sorry. Sorry.
It's my fault.


515
00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:22.401
- I don't have time
for an accident.


516
00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:25.361
- I'm so sorry, I am not--

517
00:24:25.404 --> 00:24:27.101
Susan from the gym.

518
00:24:27.145 --> 00:24:28.755
- How did--

519
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:30.714
- Look, I'm Phil, by the way.

520
00:24:30.757 --> 00:24:32.890
- Phil.
I mean, I'm not Phil.


521
00:24:32.933 --> 00:24:34.718
My name's Susan.

522
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:35.849
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

523
00:24:35.893 --> 00:24:37.590
I, uh-
-I got distracted

524
00:24:37.634 --> 00:24:40.071
like an idiot,
and next thing I know,


525
00:24:40.114 --> 00:24:41.638
I'm banging
into the back of you.


526
00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:43.509
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

527
00:24:43.553 --> 00:24:47.644
I was just heading
to a job interview at my job.


528
00:24:47.687 --> 00:24:50.342
I'm interviewing someone else
for another job


529
00:24:50.386 --> 00:24:53.345
at the place that I work at.

530
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:55.434
- Are you sure you're okay?

531
00:24:55.478 --> 00:24:57.828
- Oh, yeah,
I'm just a little shaken up,


532
00:24:57.871 --> 00:24:59.395
but I'm okay.

533
00:24:59.438 --> 00:25:02.223
- I love your "blouze."

534
00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:04.008
- Oh, "thankz."

535
00:25:04.051 --> 00:25:05.749
I love your "shoez."

536
00:25:05.792 --> 00:25:08.752
- Mm. "Thankzzz."

537
00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:13.278
All right,
let's see what we got here.


538
00:25:13.322 --> 00:25:15.759
Um, that's not too bad, right?

539
00:25:15.802 --> 00:25:19.023
- Yeah, just a little denty.

540
00:25:19.066 --> 00:25:20.503
- I'd hate to get
insurance involved.


541
00:25:20.546 --> 00:25:22.461
It'd take forever.

542
00:25:22.505 --> 00:25:24.202
- Who's got that kind of time?
- Too much paperwork.


543
00:25:24.245 --> 00:25:25.638
- For sure, for sure.
- Ends up being


544
00:25:25.682 --> 00:25:27.379
more complicated
than it needs to be.


545
00:25:27.423 --> 00:25:29.381
- I don't even have it.
- I'll tell you what.


546
00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:31.557
Can I, uh, grab your phone,
and I'll put my number in it?


547
00:25:31.601 --> 00:25:33.385
- Sure.

548
00:25:33.429 --> 00:25:35.648
- Okay, and then why
don't you get an estimate,


549
00:25:35.692 --> 00:25:39.086
and you can just text me,
and I could, I don't know,


550
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.175
pop over to your place
and bring a check,


551
00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:43.830
or I can just send it
in the mail, either.


552
00:25:43.874 --> 00:25:46.267
- Sure.
You send it or pop over.


553
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.052
It's up to you.

554
00:25:48.095 --> 00:25:51.098
- Great.
So I will send or pop.


555
00:25:51.142 --> 00:25:53.144
- Great.

556
00:25:53.187 --> 00:25:56.060
- Oh, and please,
will you take this


557
00:25:56.103 --> 00:25:58.584
and get a massage to work
that kink out of your neck?


558
00:25:58.628 --> 00:26:00.412
- It is a little kinky.

559
00:26:00.456 --> 00:26:02.066
- Hmm.

560
00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:03.676
You're funny.

561
00:26:05.548 --> 00:26:07.463
- You're nice
to say I'm funny.


562
00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:10.161
- Oh, well, you're nice to say
I'm nice to say you're funny.


563
00:26:10.204 --> 00:26:12.206
That's funny.

564
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.687
- Well, I am
both sorry and happy


565
00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:16.210
that I bumped into you, Susan.

566
00:26:16.254 --> 00:26:18.212
- Likewise.

567
00:26:18.256 --> 00:26:19.866
Oh, uh--

568
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.955
- Yep.
Here you go.


569
00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:23.348
- Thank you.
- All right.


570
00:26:23.392 --> 00:26:26.220
- Text me.
- Maybe I will.


571
00:26:33.402 --> 00:26:35.534
both: ♪ When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff ♪


572
00:26:35.578 --> 00:26:37.667
♪ Then I'm so strung out

579
00:26:51.898 --> 00:26:53.683
I'm the--
- Oh, what happened?


580
00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:55.815
What happened?

581
00:26:55.859 --> 00:26:57.948
- I said "I'm the one."
Is it "You're the one?"


582
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.340
- Oh, you're just thinking
about him, aren't you?


583
00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:00.603
- I am.

584
00:27:00.646 --> 00:27:02.387
I am thinking
about him, Corrin.


585
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:04.258
Can I borrow your Spanx
for tonight?


586
00:27:04.302 --> 00:27:06.217
- No, the boys made
eye masks out of them.


587
00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.610
- Oh, I just--

588
00:27:07.653 --> 00:27:09.873
I want to look
sucked in for my date.


589
00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:11.744
- Are you sure it's a date?

590
00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:15.966
- Corrin.
- What?


591
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.837
- He's bringing money
over to my place.


592
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:19.796
I mean, that doesn't seem
like a date to you?


593
00:27:19.839 --> 00:27:21.841
- Well, no.

594
00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:24.801
- I mean, he could have
met me at the gym,


595
00:27:24.844 --> 00:27:27.804
or he could have mailed it,
but he offered to come over.


596
00:27:27.847 --> 00:27:29.980
I mean, this is huge.

597
00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:31.503
- I don't know.
It could be huge.


598
00:27:31.547 --> 00:27:33.200
- Ah, this is, like,
bigger than huge.


599
00:27:33.244 --> 00:27:34.985
It's gigantic.

600
00:27:35.028 --> 00:27:37.117
- Mm, maybe, maybe, maybe,
Susan, maybe.


601
00:27:37.161 --> 00:27:39.424
- I mean--I mean,
it's, like, life-changing.


602
00:27:39.468 --> 00:27:41.731
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Get the invitations ready!


603
00:27:41.774 --> 00:27:44.821
- Yeah, it's just--
Don't mail them.


604
00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:47.301
- I mean, Corrin,
this could be


605
00:27:47.345 --> 00:27:49.739
what I've been
waiting for, you know?


606
00:27:49.782 --> 00:27:54.483
A partner, someone to take
care of me for a change.


607
00:27:54.526 --> 00:27:56.746
- Nancy, give it back.
- I don't know.


608
00:27:56.789 --> 00:28:02.403
Maybe--maybe we're all born
not whole but halves,


609
00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:04.362
and we spend our whole lives

610
00:28:04.405 --> 00:28:08.018
searching for our other half,
you know?


611
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:10.716
And only then does
everything become easy.


612
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.241
Only then do we realize,
you know, our full potential.


613
00:28:14.285 --> 00:28:17.897
- Give it back! Give it back!
- Oh, my God.


614
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:20.552
Shit, how long
has that been in there?


615
00:28:21.814 --> 00:28:23.729
- In your dreams,
dick breath!


616
00:28:23.773 --> 00:28:25.818
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
slow it down, slow it down.


617
00:28:25.862 --> 00:28:28.212
- Corrin, whose turn is it
to put her to bed?


618
00:28:28.255 --> 00:28:29.343
- Yours.

619
00:28:29.387 --> 00:28:30.997
- I will move all the shit

620
00:28:31.041 --> 00:28:33.217
from the porch up to the attic
if you will do it.


621
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.088
- I'll give you a blowjob
if you'll do it.


622
00:28:35.132 --> 00:28:36.481
- I'm too tired for a blowjob.

623
00:28:36.525 --> 00:28:37.917
- All right,
just give her to me.


624
00:28:37.961 --> 00:28:39.919
- Hi, Tom.

625
00:28:39.963 --> 00:28:42.443
- Why do you look so happy?
- Don't worry about it.


626
00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:44.228
It's none of your beeswax.

627
00:28:44.271 --> 00:28:46.099
Anyway, I should
probably get going.


628
00:28:46.143 --> 00:28:48.798
Good night, Vivi.
- Good night, Susie.


629
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:51.409
Here's a blowjob.

630
00:28:51.452 --> 00:28:52.584
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm--


631
00:28:52.628 --> 00:28:53.803
- That's your fault.

632
00:29:05.858 --> 00:29:07.120
- It's open.

633
00:29:10.254 --> 00:29:12.212
- Where--

634
00:29:12.256 --> 00:29:16.216
- Oh, hey, drawn in
by my musical stylings?


635
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.568
- Leon, listen,
I love music, okay?


636
00:29:19.611 --> 00:29:22.614
Literally, it's my life, but--

637
00:29:22.658 --> 00:29:25.312
- Oh, well,
what's your favorite, jazz?


638
00:29:25.356 --> 00:29:27.837
- No, n--

639
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.404
- Oh, you're a country girl.

640
00:29:32.929 --> 00:29:34.583
- No.

641
00:29:34.626 --> 00:29:35.932
- Well, maybe you're
feeling the blues.


642
00:29:38.848 --> 00:29:41.851
- Look, Leon, it's just
I have a friend


643
00:29:41.894 --> 00:29:43.200
coming over tonight, okay?

644
00:29:43.243 --> 00:29:44.854
And I'm a little nervous,

645
00:29:44.897 --> 00:29:49.510
and your piano playing
is making me dizzy.


646
00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:54.428
- Oh, all right.
Um, yeah, band's on a break.


647
00:29:54.472 --> 00:29:57.170
- Mm-hmm, band's on a break.
Okay.


648
00:29:57.214 --> 00:29:58.563
- You want to hear a joke?

649
00:30:00.609 --> 00:30:02.567
- No, I do not.

650
00:30:02.611 --> 00:30:05.657
- All right.
Have fun with your friend.


651
00:30:05.701 --> 00:30:09.661
- Oh, actually, um,
can I ask a favor?


652
00:30:09.705 --> 00:30:13.970
My nails are wet, and I need
to take my rollers out.


653
00:30:14.013 --> 00:30:18.322
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much, yeah.


654
00:30:18.365 --> 00:30:20.498
Start on the left there,
mm-hmm.


655
00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:22.456
Just pull 'em out.
- Like this?


656
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.722
- Yeah, just like--just like
they're made to be pulled.


657
00:30:26.765 --> 00:30:29.812
Just--oh, ow, ow, yeah.

658
00:30:29.855 --> 00:30:32.379
- It hurts?

659
00:30:32.423 --> 00:30:34.773
- Yeah, well,
it doesn't feel good.


660
00:30:34.817 --> 00:30:36.906
- It looks great. Wow.
- Yeah. Oh.


661
00:30:40.561 --> 00:30:44.261
- Uh, I'm coming.

662
00:30:44.304 --> 00:30:48.569
- ♪ Oh, oh yeah

663
00:30:53.487 --> 00:30:57.361
♪ Distance in between
you and me ♪


664
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.193
- Wow.
Those are some boots.


665
00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:04.977
- Mm, thanks.

666
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:06.718
Hi.

667
00:31:06.762 --> 00:31:08.415
- Not many people
can pull those off.


668
00:31:08.459 --> 00:31:11.592
- Oh. I got these
quite a while ago, yeah.


669
00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:14.552
- Sorry to, uh--
I brought your check.


670
00:31:14.595 --> 00:31:17.163
$420, right?

671
00:31:17.207 --> 00:31:18.730
- Yep, that is correct.

672
00:31:18.774 --> 00:31:21.733
At least that's what
Bumper Stickler said.


673
00:31:21.777 --> 00:31:23.953
Although they won't be able
to fix it for a little while


674
00:31:23.996 --> 00:31:25.694
because they're so jammed up.

675
00:31:25.737 --> 00:31:27.913
- Hmm.
- It's bumper season, I guess.


676
00:31:31.525 --> 00:31:33.745
Anyway, nice of you
to come here.


677
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:35.051
- Oh, no, no, come on.

678
00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:36.835
It's on--it's on
my way home, so...


679
00:31:36.879 --> 00:31:38.924
- Uh, great.
- Well, I should--


680
00:31:38.968 --> 00:31:40.230
- Oh, no,
you came all this way.


681
00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:41.884
At least I could feed you.

682
00:31:41.927 --> 00:31:43.929
I just made dinner,
and when I hungry cook,


683
00:31:43.973 --> 00:31:46.279
I make way too much food.

684
00:31:46.323 --> 00:31:48.151
- Oh, I don't--I don't want
to impose on your--


685
00:31:48.194 --> 00:31:49.979
- Not an imposition.

686
00:31:50.022 --> 00:31:52.111
If it was an imposition,
I'd say, "It's an imposition,"


687
00:31:52.155 --> 00:31:53.504
but I didn't say that, did I?

688
00:31:53.547 --> 00:31:55.506
- No, you didn't.

689
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:59.249
Well, then I--I guess
I am a little hungry.


690
00:32:00.816 --> 00:32:02.165
- And then the ladder gave out,

691
00:32:02.208 --> 00:32:03.819
and I thought to myself,

692
00:32:03.862 --> 00:32:05.777
"This is it, Phil.
This is where you die."


693
00:32:05.821 --> 00:32:07.736
- What?

694
00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:09.520
- And you'll never guess
where I landed.


695
00:32:09.563 --> 00:32:11.652
- What?
Well, just tell me.


696
00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:13.350
- No, I said guess.
Guess.


697
00:32:13.393 --> 00:32:15.831
- I--a puddle?
- Mm-mm.


698
00:32:15.874 --> 00:32:18.921
- A thicket?
- Mm.


699
00:32:18.964 --> 00:32:20.574
- I don't know,
a plate of cookies?


700
00:32:20.618 --> 00:32:22.663
Where?
- My brother.


701
00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:24.535
I landed on my brother.

702
00:32:24.578 --> 00:32:27.103
- Oh, my God.
Did you kill him?


703
00:32:27.146 --> 00:32:30.976
- No, believe it or not,
tiny scratch on his elbow.


704
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.457
- Well, that sure was lucky.

705
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.242
If I fell on my brother,
I'd want it to hurt.


706
00:32:37.853 --> 00:32:39.637
- Families can be rough, huh?

707
00:32:41.639 --> 00:32:45.164
So do you really
heart quilting?


708
00:32:45.208 --> 00:32:46.731
- Hmm?

709
00:32:46.775 --> 00:32:48.994
- The bumper sticker
on your car.


710
00:32:49.038 --> 00:32:52.302
- Oh, that was on the car
when my mom bought it.


711
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.651
- Hmm.

712
00:32:53.694 --> 00:32:56.480
- And then
I bought it from her


713
00:32:56.523 --> 00:33:00.571
'cause I had money--have--
I had and have money.


714
00:33:00.614 --> 00:33:03.879
- So you don't quilt?
- No, I collage.


715
00:33:03.922 --> 00:33:05.750
- I'm sorry?
You went to college?


716
00:33:05.794 --> 00:33:07.796
- No, I do collages.

717
00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:09.145
- Collage?
- Yeah, like this.


718
00:33:09.188 --> 00:33:12.583
- Oh.
Wait, Susan, you did this?


719
00:33:12.626 --> 00:33:14.585
- That's all me, yeah.

720
00:33:14.628 --> 00:33:16.717
- It's amazing.
- Thank you.


721
00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:19.242
I also do little collages
for burnt children.


722
00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:21.113
- Burnt children?

723
00:33:21.157 --> 00:33:24.769
- In the burn ward
at the hospital?


724
00:33:24.813 --> 00:33:27.990
- Oh.
Susan, you're amazing.


725
00:33:28.033 --> 00:33:30.557
- Thank you.

726
00:33:30.601 --> 00:33:31.994
Oh-oh.

727
00:33:32.037 --> 00:33:35.606
- I'm so sorry.

728
00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:39.218
I--I guess I ate too much.
It was all so delicious.


729
00:33:39.262 --> 00:33:42.874
- Hey, hey, do not apologize
for being adorable,


730
00:33:42.918 --> 00:33:45.485
and you're an amazing cook.

731
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:47.009
- Thank you.

732
00:33:47.052 --> 00:33:50.055
- Susan, can I
ask you something?


733
00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:51.840
- Anything.

734
00:33:51.883 --> 00:33:54.146
- Do you like to jump?

735
00:33:55.278 --> 00:33:56.235
- Do I?

736
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.850
I mean, do I?

737
00:34:01.893 --> 00:34:05.027
Where are you taking me?
Is this a haunted house?


738
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.942
- Just be patient.
You'll see.


739
00:34:06.985 --> 00:34:09.161
Now stand right there.
I'm gonna turn the light on.


740
00:34:09.205 --> 00:34:11.076
I don't want you to trip
and hurt yourself.


741
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.861
- Okay, I'm a statue.

742
00:34:15.602 --> 00:34:17.082
What?

743
00:34:17.126 --> 00:34:20.303
Wow.
You work here?


744
00:34:20.346 --> 00:34:23.959
- Oh, I own it.

745
00:34:24.002 --> 00:34:25.656
- You're an owner?

746
00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:27.701
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.


747
00:34:27.745 --> 00:34:30.400
This night is unfolding
like a dream collage.


748
00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:33.055
So how much does it cost
to come here?


749
00:34:33.098 --> 00:34:35.144
- $15 for adults,
$12 for children.


750
00:34:35.187 --> 00:34:37.059
- So it's $54
for a family of four.


751
00:34:37.102 --> 00:34:39.278
If they come eight times
a year, that's $432.


752
00:34:39.322 --> 00:34:44.457
- Wow, she does math, collages,
and helps burnt children?


753
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:47.678
You are a triple threat,
Susan O'Connell.


754
00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:49.462
You are something amazing.

755
00:34:49.506 --> 00:34:52.988
Hey, you ready
to get high?


756
00:36:00.881 --> 00:36:02.405
Fucking moron.

757
00:36:03.754 --> 00:36:07.279
- Susan?
Are you okay?


758
00:36:07.323 --> 00:36:09.238
- I am.

759
00:36:15.853 --> 00:36:18.987
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.


760
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:31.042
- I'm gonna--
I'm gonna wait outside.


761
00:36:31.086 --> 00:36:33.827
- Wait, I think I'm done.
I'm done.


762
00:36:38.136 --> 00:36:39.877
Do you want to get on top?

763
00:36:41.226 --> 00:36:43.272
- No, thank you.

- Those look lovely.
- Oh, thanks.


777
00:37:41.417 --> 00:37:43.071
So sleepy, huh?
- So sleepy.


778
00:37:43.114 --> 00:37:44.811
- What are you gonna
wear with it?


779
00:37:44.855 --> 00:37:46.987
- Let me pick something out
and I will surprise you.


780
00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:48.989
- ...redefine
nonstop shopping.


781
00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:50.817
You can shop...

782
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:57.346
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, hey, Velvet.


783
00:37:57.389 --> 00:37:59.783
What's wrong?
You look scared.


784
00:37:59.826 --> 00:38:02.177
- No, no.

785
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.049
I'm just, uh, swamped.

786
00:38:05.093 --> 00:38:08.574
You know, they made me manager,
so what are you gonna do?


787
00:38:08.618 --> 00:38:12.491
- Cool, cool, cool.

788
00:38:12.535 --> 00:38:15.494
That's my boyfriend,
so what are you gonna do?


789
00:38:15.538 --> 00:38:19.803
- Yeah, I really am manager.

790
00:38:19.846 --> 00:38:23.111
- Yeah, that really
is my boyfriend, so...


791
00:38:23.154 --> 00:38:24.547
- Is he?

792
00:38:30.379 --> 00:38:33.338
- We're practically engaged,
and I'm probably pregnant.


793
00:38:33.382 --> 00:38:36.124
- Just seems, you know,
kinda sudden for you


794
00:38:36.167 --> 00:38:37.734
to have a serious boyfriend.

795
00:38:37.777 --> 00:38:39.997
I mean, how well
do you know him?


796
00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.260
- Oh, my God.

797
00:38:44.262 --> 00:38:47.004
Are you jealous,
Velvet Swensen?


798
00:38:47.047 --> 00:38:48.875
- I am definitely not.

799
00:38:49.746 --> 00:38:50.703
You know what?
Forget it.


800
00:38:50.747 --> 00:38:52.314
You know,
I've got too much to do.


801
00:38:52.357 --> 00:38:55.099
I'm responsible
for every employee you see


802
00:38:55.143 --> 00:38:56.405
and the ones you don't.

803
00:38:58.581 --> 00:39:01.279
- Oh, 'cause your life is
so much more important.


804
00:39:01.323 --> 00:39:03.934
"Oh, I'm Velvet.
I was first to get my period.


805
00:39:03.977 --> 00:39:06.154
"Oh, I got a job
at Baskin-Robbins


806
00:39:06.197 --> 00:39:07.851
"even though they said
they weren't hiring.


807
00:39:07.894 --> 00:39:10.506
Oh, I go to Cancun
with my sorority girls."


808
00:39:10.549 --> 00:39:12.725
- Did you get that jacket here?
- Yes, I did.


809
00:39:12.769 --> 00:39:15.511
- Yeah, we were trying
to get rid of those.


810
00:39:15.554 --> 00:39:17.817
Staff meeting in five.

811
00:39:20.168 --> 00:39:21.604
- Phil, let's go.

812
00:39:21.647 --> 00:39:24.041
Hold my hand.
It's important.


813
00:39:24.084 --> 00:39:27.740
- Look, I got these
sweet Fourth of July trunks.


814
00:39:27.784 --> 00:39:30.265
- Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh, thank you.


815
00:39:40.188 --> 00:39:42.886
Excuse me.
This is my boyfriend.


816
00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:46.716
- Whew.

817
00:39:46.759 --> 00:39:47.978
Oh, you got
your pinwheel, babe?


818
00:39:48.021 --> 00:39:50.415
- I do.
- Okay.


819
00:39:50.459 --> 00:39:52.200
Ah, turtle,

820
00:39:52.243 --> 00:39:54.202
looks like somebody's been
straightening up.


821
00:39:54.245 --> 00:39:55.986
- I moved a couple things.

822
00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:00.991
I had a great day.
- Me too.


823
00:40:01.034 --> 00:40:05.517
- In fact, I've had
a great month.


824
00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:07.302
- Me too.

825
00:40:07.345 --> 00:40:08.607
- Argh!

826
00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:11.958
- So...
- So?


827
00:40:13.308 --> 00:40:15.745
- You want to watch a show
and rub my feet?


828
00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:18.400
- More than you know.

829
00:40:18.443 --> 00:40:20.663
My God, that would be hot.

830
00:40:20.706 --> 00:40:23.100
- But no.
I gotta go to work.


831
00:40:23.143 --> 00:40:25.145
I got to supervise
the cleaning crew,


832
00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:27.626
got a couple of complaints that
the trampolines are sticky,


833
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.062
but I'll be thinking about you.

834
00:40:29.106 --> 00:40:30.412
- Mm.

835
00:40:30.455 --> 00:40:32.892
- As I clean up
that stickiness.


836
00:40:32.936 --> 00:40:34.807
Oh, I almost for--you okay?

837
00:40:34.851 --> 00:40:36.244
- Yes.
- Sorry.


838
00:40:36.287 --> 00:40:38.333
I almost forgot.

839
00:40:38.376 --> 00:40:42.293
I got you a little something
when you weren't looking.


840
00:40:42.337 --> 00:40:45.992
- Something else?

841
00:40:46.036 --> 00:40:48.299
What the potato salad
has gotten into you,


842
00:40:48.343 --> 00:40:50.345
Phil, the owner?

843
00:40:50.388 --> 00:40:52.260
- You got into me.

844
00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:56.873
- I love it.

845
00:40:56.916 --> 00:40:58.875
It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.


846
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:02.444
- What does it mean?

847
00:41:02.487 --> 00:41:04.968
- Well...eh.

848
00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:08.928
It means whatever
you want it to mean.


849
00:41:10.582 --> 00:41:13.063
- Do you want to meet
my family?


850
00:41:13.106 --> 00:41:15.108
I mean, I understand
if it's rushed,


851
00:41:15.152 --> 00:41:18.286
or if your own family is dead,

852
00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:22.202
so families make you nervous
or sad or something,


853
00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:24.944
but it's my niece's
First Communion this Sunday.


854
00:41:24.988 --> 00:41:28.165
I don't even know
if you're a church person.


855
00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:31.342
Me, I just go
for the music, myself.


856
00:41:31.386 --> 00:41:34.345
Then next week we're supposed
to go on a family trip


857
00:41:34.389 --> 00:41:36.869
to Niagara Falls,

858
00:41:36.913 --> 00:41:38.480
but I don't know if I'm going

859
00:41:38.523 --> 00:41:41.700
because I don't have the funds
right now just because--


860
00:41:41.744 --> 00:41:44.355
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, turtle,

861
00:41:44.399 --> 00:41:48.098
if you need anything,
money, anything, you just ask.


862
00:41:49.404 --> 00:41:51.493
- Really?
- Yeah.


863
00:41:51.536 --> 00:41:53.408
We'll talk about it
at the confession.


864
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:56.933
- Communion.
- Perfect. Mm.


865
00:41:56.976 --> 00:41:59.849
And by the way, I am, uh--

866
00:41:59.892 --> 00:42:02.242
I'm pro-family.
- Oh, really?


867
00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:04.462
- Yeah.

868
00:42:04.506 --> 00:42:07.073
I love families.

869
00:42:07.117 --> 00:42:09.293
'Sup?

870
00:42:37.539 --> 00:42:40.150
- Hello?
- I'm in the kitchen.


871
00:42:40.193 --> 00:42:42.021
Come in here.

872
00:42:44.023 --> 00:42:45.851
Guess what.

873
00:42:45.895 --> 00:42:47.897
- Is it about me or you?

874
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.333
- Remember I told you
about that talent show


875
00:42:49.377 --> 00:42:51.117
I heard on KRPP?
- Yes.


876
00:42:51.161 --> 00:42:53.076
- Okay, so I was listening
to my fantasy lover,


877
00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:55.295
DJ Coyote Carl,
on the radio this morning.


878
00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.428
Long story short--
- Short story long.


879
00:42:57.472 --> 00:42:59.865
- That talent show
is this week,


880
00:42:59.909 --> 00:43:02.302
and guess who got us a spot.

881
00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:04.870
- Are you fucking kidding me?

882
00:43:04.914 --> 00:43:07.395
- And the first 25 callers

883
00:43:07.438 --> 00:43:10.049
get to perform
at the grand reopening


884
00:43:10.093 --> 00:43:12.443
of that used car dealership
over on Bayard.


885
00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:14.010
- The one that used to be
a gas station?


886
00:43:14.053 --> 00:43:15.446
- Yes, so I called.

887
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.448
- What number were you?
- 22!


888
00:43:17.492 --> 00:43:19.668
- No, I wanted to guess!
- Well, we're 22.


889
00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:21.147
- Well, why don't you
have a shirt on?


890
00:43:21.191 --> 00:43:22.758
- Oh, I gave it to Andy.

891
00:43:22.801 --> 00:43:24.673
There were skulls on it,
so he made a cape.


892
00:43:24.716 --> 00:43:26.762
- Andy, I want
to see your cape!


893
00:43:26.805 --> 00:43:29.025
- And get this,
everyone who performs


894
00:43:29.068 --> 00:43:32.332
gets a $200 gift certificate
to the Jewel-Osco.


895
00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:34.030
- That's, like, a dream.

896
00:43:34.073 --> 00:43:35.858
I'm so sick
of spending money on food.


897
00:43:35.901 --> 00:43:37.512
- Listen to this,
the winner,


898
00:43:37.555 --> 00:43:42.473
the grand prize,
gets to open for the Fat Sams


899
00:43:42.517 --> 00:43:46.390
on their tour for two months,
Susie Bird.


900
00:43:46.434 --> 00:43:48.740
How about that?
Right?


901
00:43:48.784 --> 00:43:49.828
- Oh.

902
00:43:49.872 --> 00:43:51.395
- Oh, but we need to come up

903
00:43:51.439 --> 00:43:53.266
with a name for the band
by the end of the day.


904
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.573
- This is huge.
- Hey, honey.


905
00:43:55.617 --> 00:43:57.706
Vivi wants
another slice of pizza.


906
00:43:57.749 --> 00:44:00.535
- Are we out of pizza?
- No.


907
00:44:00.578 --> 00:44:04.495
- So go in there, open the box,
put your hand in,


908
00:44:04.539 --> 00:44:06.932
take out a slice,
and give it to her.


909
00:44:06.976 --> 00:44:09.848
- Okay, honey, thank you.
I can do that.


910
00:44:09.892 --> 00:44:11.589
- Hey, Tom, we need
a name for our band.


911
00:44:11.633 --> 00:44:13.156
We're trying to think
of a name.


912
00:44:13.199 --> 00:44:16.333
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."


913
00:44:16.376 --> 00:44:18.378
- We need something clever
that says, like,


914
00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:20.511
ladies who play the ukulele
and the flute.


915
00:44:20.555 --> 00:44:24.646
- How about
Ukulady and the Tramp?


916
00:44:24.689 --> 00:44:26.517
- Why don't you go rest
your mouth, okay?


917
00:44:26.561 --> 00:44:28.084
- I kinda like
Ukulady and the Tramp.


918
00:44:28.127 --> 00:44:29.520
- I know, I do too.

919
00:44:29.564 --> 00:44:31.348
I just don't want
to give it to him.

moving in together soon,

988

really his fault.

- Hi.

- Have you guys seen Blair?

997
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.584
- Actually, I think I saw her
flirting with the bartender.


998
00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:46.195
- Classic.
- But that was a while ago.


999
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:48.588
- Typical.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What does everyone
have against Blair?


1001
00:47:50.286 --> 00:47:51.809
I thought you were
all friends.


1002
00:47:51.853 --> 00:47:53.376
- Not anymore,
'cause she never thinks


1003
00:47:53.419 --> 00:47:55.378
before she opens
her big mouth.


1004
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:57.336
She also talks like a robot.

1005
00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.427
She also chews way too loud,
like a farm animal.


1006
00:48:01.471 --> 00:48:03.603
- That is harsh.

1007

- Oh, hey, will you
bring me that rosé?


1008
00:48:05.562 --> 00:48:07.259
- Oh, and a Basil Hayden's,
while you're at it?


1009
00:48:09.087 --> 00:48:11.611
- You have got
to be kidding me!


1010
00:48:18.183 --> 00:48:20.185
- Nice way to start your day.

1011
00:48:20.229 --> 00:48:22.100
- Look, I work
just up the street,


1012
00:48:22.144 --> 00:48:24.189
and I'm late for a very,
very important presentation,


1013
00:48:24.233 --> 00:48:26.626
so if you could just meet me
there, that would really--


1014
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:27.976
- What?
- In, like, 30 minutes.


1015
00:48:28.019 --> 00:48:29.760
It's gonna be totally fine.

1016

- No, y--


1017
00:48:33.372 --> 00:48:35.723
- Why aren't you
wearing shoes?


1018
00:48:35.766 --> 00:48:37.812
- Grace.

1019
00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:40.466
- This is a big deal, Sylvia.
Congratulations.


1020
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.642
- Wow, um, what an honor
to have been--


1021
00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.383
- Hold on, Hannah and I
still have to go.


1022

going with this?

such an annoying bitch?


1027

- Oh, that's really nice.

1028
00:48:54.089 --> 00:48:56.526
Look, I have no idea

1029
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:58.963
but whatever it is,
I'm sorry, I'll stop.


1030

what you did.


1031
00:49:00.878 --> 00:49:02.271
- No, I don't.
- Oh, yeah?


1032

1033
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:09.800
- Go fish.

1034
00:49:09.844 --> 00:49:12.020

1035
00:49:12.063 --> 00:49:13.891
Check this out.

1036
00:49:16.067 --> 00:49:18.156

1038

1039
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:23.901
Okay, sorry.

1040
00:49:23.945 --> 00:49:25.947

1041
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.687
-You have any threes?

1042
00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:31.735
- I mean, what--
what did happen to your legs?


1043
00:49:31.779 --> 00:49:35.173

1044

- Go fish.


1045

That's--that's sad.


1046
00:49:42.137 --> 00:49:45.183
Anyway, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna bounce.


1047

1048
00:49:50.406 --> 00:49:52.582
- You are a cheater.

1049
00:50:11.906 --> 00:50:14.169
- Yay, you made it.
- Sorry, Jensy.


1050
00:50:14.212 --> 00:50:17.302
I can't stay.
Just grabbing some eats to go.


1051
00:50:17.346 --> 00:50:19.827
- You even sound
like your father.


1052
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.265
You need to wear a slip, Susan.
- I'm with them.


1053
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:43.938
Excuse me.

1054
00:50:43.981 --> 00:50:45.983
I'm looking for Phil,
the owner.


1055
00:50:46.027 --> 00:50:48.681
- Uh, yeah, he should
be around here somewhere.


1056
00:50:48.725 --> 00:50:51.859
Uh, there he is.

1057
00:50:51.902 --> 00:50:55.253
Over by the foam pit
with his wife and kids.


1058
00:50:57.952 --> 00:51:00.824
Great guy.
Great dad too.


1059
00:51:02.608 --> 00:51:05.133
Uh, ma'am, you dropped
your bag or your purse.


1060
00:51:05.176 --> 00:51:07.135
Oh, that's your purse.

1061
00:51:36.512 --> 00:51:38.775
- ♪ All the kids
in the marketplace say ♪


1062
00:51:38.818 --> 00:51:41.125
both: ♪ Way-oh, way-oh

1063
00:51:41.169 --> 00:51:45.477
♪ Way-oh, way-oh

1064
00:51:55.923 --> 00:52:00.492
- Susan, maybe
it wasn't his wife.


1065
00:52:00.536 --> 00:52:03.582
- But the tall, weird kid
said it was his wife.


1066
00:52:03.626 --> 00:52:05.541
- It was probably his wife.

1067
00:52:07.935 --> 00:52:10.850
- I don't know, Corrin,
she was pregnant,


1068
00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:13.114
and she had that
pregnant glow, you know?


1069
00:52:13.157 --> 00:52:16.073
And she looked so happy.
- Aww.


1070
00:52:16.117 --> 00:52:18.989
- Like a woman on one
of my dream collages.


1071
00:52:19.033 --> 00:52:22.253
- Well, but her husband's
cheating on her.


1072
00:52:22.297 --> 00:52:24.821
- Yeah,
but she doesn't know that,


1073
00:52:24.864 --> 00:52:26.823
and what you don't know
doesn't count.


1074
00:52:30.827 --> 00:52:32.785
I don't count, you know?

1075
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:35.658
- Of course you count.
Come on.


1076
00:52:35.701 --> 00:52:37.486
- In my mind, Corrin,
we were--


1077
00:52:37.529 --> 00:52:38.704
we were already married,
you know?


1078
00:52:38.748 --> 00:52:40.315
- Yeah.

1079
00:52:40.358 --> 00:52:42.491
- And, um, raising kids
of our own, you know?


1080
00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:44.972
They were--they were sweet
and small like Phil,


1081
00:52:45.015 --> 00:52:46.930
but, you know,
they had hair and everything.


1082
00:52:46.974 --> 00:52:48.801
- Listen to me.
Look at me.


1083
00:52:48.845 --> 00:52:50.368
You can still have kids,

1084
00:52:50.412 --> 00:52:52.501
just not with Phil,
but you can--listen.


1085
00:52:52.544 --> 00:52:54.329
You can have them
with somebody else.


1086
00:52:54.372 --> 00:52:56.461
You can even have them
by yourself.


1087
00:52:56.505 --> 00:52:58.072
- When you say his name,
it's like you literally


1088
00:52:58.115 --> 00:53:00.074
took razor blades
and you cut my face.


1089
00:53:00.117 --> 00:53:01.379
- Sorry.
But you know what?


1090
00:53:01.423 --> 00:53:03.294
Heartache is great for music.

1091
00:53:03.338 --> 00:53:05.035
So why don't you
take these feelings


1092
00:53:05.079 --> 00:53:07.995
you're having
of loneliness and sadness


1093
00:53:08.038 --> 00:53:10.258
and channel it for the show?

1094
00:53:10.301 --> 00:53:12.042
- Yeah.
- For the show, the show.


1095
00:53:12.086 --> 00:53:13.261
- Okay, yeah, I am.
- All right?


1096
00:53:13.304 --> 00:53:14.653
- I think it's gonna
be a good show.


1097
00:53:14.697 --> 00:53:15.741
It's gonna be a good show.

1098
00:53:15.785 --> 00:53:17.352
- You're gonna be fine.

1099
00:53:17.395 --> 00:53:18.483
- Yeah,
we're gonna be great.


1100
00:53:18.527 --> 00:53:20.050
- Yeah.
- I should probably go.


1101
00:53:20.094 --> 00:53:21.704
- Okay.
You should go home and rest.


1102
00:53:21.747 --> 00:53:23.488
Don't think about Phil!
- Ow, my face.


1103
00:53:23.532 --> 00:53:24.837
- Sorry.

1104
00:53:24.881 --> 00:53:27.231
- Hey, Susan, this is Doug.

1105
00:53:27.275 --> 00:53:30.365
I got your IOU
and this collection


1106
00:53:30.408 --> 00:53:32.932
of magazine clippings
pasted together


1107
00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:35.109
on a piece of paper.

1108
00:53:35.152 --> 00:53:37.676
They're very nice, but they
do not your rent make. Plea--


1109
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.591
- Susan, it's your mother.

1110
00:53:39.635 --> 00:53:41.767
We need to be at the airport
at 1:00 tomorrow.


1111
00:53:41.811 --> 00:53:43.856
Cameron wants us
to just take a cab,


1112
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.597
but I don't want him throwing
his hard-earned money away


1113
00:53:45.641 --> 00:53:47.164
when you're
not doing anything.


1114
00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.094
- So what are you looking
to get for this today?


1115
00:54:04.138 --> 00:54:07.402
- Uh, two--

1116
00:54:07.445 --> 00:54:09.360
$20,000?

1117
00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:15.671
- The diamonds are moissanite.
I'll give you 250.


1118
00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:17.455
Take it or leave it.

1119
00:54:17.499 --> 00:54:20.937
- It's fine.

1120
00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.592
How much is this?

1121
00:54:23.635 --> 00:54:26.377
- $5.
- I want this too.


1122
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:28.945
- Okay.
- But I want it for free.


1123
00:54:31.817 --> 00:54:33.080
- Okay.

1124
00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.391
- A little more weight
towards the--


1125
00:54:40.435 --> 00:54:41.784
- I'm going to pull it out
and then--


1126
00:54:44.917 --> 00:54:47.094
- What's with the suitcases?

1127
00:54:47.137 --> 00:54:50.053
- I'm coming with you
to Niagara Falls,


1128
00:54:50.097 --> 00:54:52.055
which means I can't drive us,

1129
00:54:52.099 --> 00:54:54.666
so I guess we're gonna
have to take a taxi.


1130
00:54:56.973 --> 00:55:00.063
- How'd you pay for a ticket?
- Don't worry about it.


1131
00:55:00.107 --> 00:55:01.630
It's just a one-way ticket,

1132
00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:03.632
but I'll figure out
how to get back.


1133
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:05.373
Who knows,
maybe I'll even stay


1134
00:55:05.416 --> 00:55:09.203
and make a life for myself
there under the falls.


1135
00:55:09.246 --> 00:55:13.163
- Do you have a passport?
- What?


1136
00:55:13.207 --> 00:55:16.166
- Canada's another country.
You need a passport.


1137
00:55:17.646 --> 00:55:19.169
- How long does it take to--

1138
00:55:19.213 --> 00:55:20.649
- It took us over a month
to get ours


1139
00:55:20.692 --> 00:55:22.651
because the system
is so overwhelmed.


1140
00:55:27.786 --> 00:55:29.962
- I brought
an empty shampoo bottle,


1141
00:55:30.006 --> 00:55:32.313
and it said on the website
of the hotel


1142
00:55:32.356 --> 00:55:34.663
that you could win
a free return trip next year.


1143
00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:36.578
- Wait, what's that about
a shampoo bottle?


1144
00:55:36.621 --> 00:55:38.232
- Yeah, I guess people take
some of the water


1145
00:55:38.275 --> 00:55:39.885
back home
with them from the falls.


1146
00:55:39.929 --> 00:55:41.931
- Oh, I didn't know that.

1147
00:55:41.974 --> 00:55:43.498
- And I think I read
on the website


1148
00:55:43.541 --> 00:55:45.282
that the hotel
has a free dessert


1149
00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:48.938
and happy hour
from 5:00 to 7:00 every night.


1150
00:55:48.981 --> 00:55:50.679
- Stop! Get out!

1151
00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:53.943
Get the hell out of my car!
Get out!


1152
00:55:53.986 --> 00:55:55.553
- Ooh!
- Thanks.


1153
00:55:55.597 --> 00:55:57.207
Uh, get out on Daddy's side.
Just go by--


1154
00:55:57.251 --> 00:55:59.035
- Great, Susan, great.
Real nice.


1155
00:55:59.078 --> 00:56:01.211
Cursing in front
of my fucking grandbaby.


1156
00:56:01.255 --> 00:56:03.126
- I got this one, Cameron.
- I just don't understand you.


1157
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.606
Like you got a screw loose.

1158
00:56:04.649 --> 00:56:07.522
Do you have
a screw loose, Susan?


1159
00:56:07.565 --> 00:56:10.481
- This is not your car.
It's Mom's--hey, hey!


1160
00:56:10.525 --> 00:56:13.441
Hey!

1161
00:56:16.095 --> 00:56:19.229
- That's my bag.
- Sorry, Mom, I'm sorry.


1162

00:57:56.195 --> 00:57:58.676
- Are you okay?

1178
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.461
- I've been better.

1179
00:58:00.504 --> 00:58:01.984
- Well, you're gonna be great
after the show.


1180
00:58:02.027 --> 00:58:04.421
You know why?
'Cause music heals you,


1181
00:58:04.465 --> 00:58:07.206
and that is why I have been up
since 3:00 in the morning,


1182
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:08.686
'cause I'm so excited.

1183
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:10.340
- Mm-hmm.

1184
00:58:10.384 --> 00:58:11.820
- I just feel like
my whole life


1185
00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:13.474
is about arriving
at this point, you know?


1186
00:58:13.517 --> 00:58:16.564
Yeah, me too.

1187
00:58:16.607 --> 00:58:18.392
- What are we gonna wear?

1188
00:58:18.435 --> 00:58:20.350
- I don't know. I'll probably
wear my jean jacket.


1189
00:58:20.394 --> 00:58:22.265
- Oh, that's a great idea.
Maybe I'll wear mine.


1190
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:23.658
I mean, we have to match,
right?


1191
00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:26.138
Like Destiny's Child?

1192
00:58:26.182 --> 00:58:28.010
Okay, so the show
starts at 7:00.


1193
00:58:28.053 --> 00:58:29.751
Why don't you meet me there
at 5:00,


1194
00:58:29.794 --> 00:58:31.361
and we can have
a bratwurst or something,


1195
00:58:31.405 --> 00:58:33.102
and then we'll just run it
a bunch of times?


1196
00:58:33.145 --> 00:58:34.364
- Okay.
- That sound good?


1197
00:58:34.408 --> 00:58:36.671
I'll see you soon?

1198
00:58:36.714 --> 00:58:39.064
- Was I always like this?

1199
00:58:39.108 --> 00:58:40.675
- Like what?
What are you talking about?


1200
00:58:43.808 --> 00:58:45.506
- Never mind.

1201
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:47.725
- Okay, I'll see you there.
I'm so excited.


1202
00:59:50.527 --> 00:59:52.747
- You'll have to go ask Mommy.
Come on, come on, Kyle.


1203
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:54.879
- What?
- They're hungry.


1204
00:59:54.923 --> 00:59:56.620
- Well, okay, there's,
like, 5,000 food tables.


1205
00:59:56.664 --> 00:59:58.361
Go get them
a fried stick of something.


1206
00:59:58.405 --> 01:00:02.147
- Well, do you have money?
- I gave you, like, $12.


1207
01:00:02.191 --> 01:00:03.932
- It's in the car.
- I'm rehearsing.


1208
01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.412
Can you see
that I am rehearsing?


1209
01:00:05.455 --> 01:00:07.457
- You're not doing anything.
- I am.


1210
01:00:07.501 --> 01:00:09.459
I've been going over beats in
my head and rhythm and stuff.


1211
01:00:09.503 --> 01:00:11.592
Besides, this is backstage,
and it's talent only.


1212
01:00:11.635 --> 01:00:13.507
I don't think you guys
are allowed.


1213
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:16.248
- What are you talking about?
There's no backstage.


1214
01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:19.007
- The mailbox is full

1215
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.530
and cannot accept
any messages at this time.


1216
01:01:20.574 --> 01:01:22.445
Good-bye.

1217
01:01:22.489 --> 01:01:25.274
- All right, number 22.
Huh?


1218
01:01:25.317 --> 01:01:26.667
Looking for number 22?

1219
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:29.147
- Oh, my God.
That's me over here.


1220
01:01:29.191 --> 01:01:30.584
Hi.
You're Coyote Carl.


1221
01:01:30.627 --> 01:01:32.107
- I am.
- Wow.


1222
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:33.891
I can't believe
I'm meeting you in person.


1223
01:01:33.935 --> 01:01:35.893
I mean, I listen to you
on the radio every single day.


1224
01:01:35.937 --> 01:01:37.765
Well, that's how I knew
about this whole thing,


1225
01:01:37.808 --> 01:01:39.549
and I've even seen you
on TV once or twice,


1226
01:01:39.593 --> 01:01:42.247
but this is--
wow, this is great.


1227
01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:44.032
- Yeah, I love me those
string instruments.


1228
01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.250
- Oh, yeah.

1229
01:01:45.294 --> 01:01:46.643
- I dated a banjo player
back in college.


1230
01:01:46.687 --> 01:01:48.210
- Oh, yeah?

1231
01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:50.081
- Whew, did she teach me
how to pluck.


1232
01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:52.388
If you know what I mean.
- I know what you mean, yeah.


1233
01:01:52.431 --> 01:01:55.086
- All right, number 22?
- Yeah.


1234
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.567
- Ukulady and the Tramp?
- Well, I'm the Ukulady,


1235
01:01:57.611 --> 01:02:00.570
and the Tramp's not here yet,
but she'll--she'll be here.


1236
01:02:00.614 --> 01:02:02.616
- All right, well,
she better not take too long


1237
01:02:02.659 --> 01:02:04.531
'cause we got three
more acts ahead of you.


1238
01:02:04.574 --> 01:02:05.575
All right, good luck,
little strummer girl.


1239
01:02:05.619 --> 01:02:08.491
- Thanks.

1240
01:02:08.535 --> 01:02:10.624
Hey, Coyote, sorry.

1241
01:02:24.463 --> 01:02:27.118
- Hey, Miss, we're gonna need
you to come down from there.


1242
01:02:27.162 --> 01:02:28.555
- Ah.

- And that was the Daddies.

1245
01:02:36.911 --> 01:02:39.087
My daddy couldn't carry a tune
to save his life,


1246
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.610
but boy, did he teach me
how to whittle.


1247
01:02:40.654 --> 01:02:42.307
That's right.

1248
01:02:42.351 --> 01:02:43.657
How about some more
Farmingville talent?


1249
01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.919
What do you guys say?

1250
01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:46.747
That's right.

1251

- No, no, I'll do it.
- All right.


1254
01:02:54.015 --> 01:02:55.799
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together


1255
01:02:55.843 --> 01:02:59.237
for our last act of the night,
Ukulady and no Tramp.

01:03:04.852 --> 01:03:07.681
- The bracelet is
just magnificent.

- I mean, it's just breath--

- The authorities' suspicions

approached the scene.

near Route 53

1264
01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:20.607
turned out to be
an intoxicated woman


1265
01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:23.479
vandalizing private property
with graffiti.


1266
01:03:23.522 --> 01:03:24.567
The woman
remains uncooperative


1267
01:03:24.611 --> 01:03:26.090
with local law enforcement,

1268
01:03:26.134 --> 01:03:29.528

- Hello?

1337
01:10:23.725 --> 01:10:26.554
- Hi, Tom.
Is Corrin there?


1338
01:10:26.597 --> 01:10:28.991
- She doesn't want
to talk to you.


1339
01:10:29.035 --> 01:10:31.080
- Come--come on, Tom.
I know--


1340
01:11:04.418 --> 01:11:08.117
I know I missed the show,
but I got detained,


1341
01:11:08.161 --> 01:11:10.424
and when I say that,
I literally mean detained,


1342
01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:14.080
arraigned and detained
for spray-painting Phil's face.


1343
01:11:14.123 --> 01:11:16.995
- Do you have any idea how
embarrassed I was last night?


1344
01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:18.823
- How embarrassed you were?

1345
01:11:18.867 --> 01:11:21.913
Corrin, 700 firefighters
saw up my skirt.


1346
01:11:21.957 --> 01:11:23.567
- You know what?
I don't care.


1347
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:25.178
It doesn't even matter,
all right, Susan?


1348
01:11:25.221 --> 01:11:26.875
I don't even know
what you're talking about.


1349
01:11:26.918 --> 01:11:28.964
What you did to me
last night was inexcusable,


1350
01:11:29.007 --> 01:11:30.400
and I'm tired of it.

1351
01:11:30.444 --> 01:11:31.749
I'm tired of taking care
of you.


1352
01:11:31.793 --> 01:11:33.969
I'm tired of worrying
about you.


1353
01:11:34.012 --> 01:11:36.493
Everything you do
is always about you,


1354
01:11:36.537 --> 01:11:39.279
and I'm done, and I'm done
with your crazy stories.


1355
01:11:39.322 --> 01:11:41.150
- Corrin, but I'm ready
to get my shit together


1356
01:11:41.194 --> 01:11:42.804
for real this time.

1357
01:11:42.847 --> 01:11:44.719
- I don't believe you, Susan.
It's like--


1358
01:11:44.762 --> 01:11:47.025
It's like you're stuck,
like you're stuck in quicksand.


1359
01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:49.115
- Mom, can we bust this
over your head?


1360
01:11:49.158 --> 01:11:50.942
- No, please get that
out of the house.


1361
01:11:50.986 --> 01:11:52.988
- Move.
- Hey, Tom.


1362
01:11:53.031 --> 01:11:55.904
Um, also,

1363
01:11:55.947 --> 01:11:58.124
I have been temporarily evicted
from my apartment.


1364
01:11:58.167 --> 01:11:59.342
- Oh, Jesus.

1365
01:11:59.386 --> 01:12:00.778
- And I was just wondering--

1366
01:12:00.822 --> 01:12:02.563
I know it's not
a good time to ask


1367
01:12:02.606 --> 01:12:04.782
if I could stay with you guys
for just a couple--


1368
01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:14.183
- When it rains, it pours,
dick breath.


1369
01:12:14.227 --> 01:12:16.533
- Boys, that wasn't funny.

1370
01:12:16.577 --> 01:12:18.405
- Sorry.
- Good shot.


1371
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:34.029
- Leon?

1372
01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:19.379
- Oh, oh.

1373
01:13:19.422 --> 01:13:21.250
Jesus. Susan.

1374
01:13:21.294 --> 01:13:23.731
Jesus Christ, you scared
the shit out of me.


1375
01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:26.212
- Sorry, not sorry.
What do you want, Doug?


1376
01:13:26.255 --> 01:13:28.170
- What are you doing
in Leon's apartment?


1377
01:13:28.214 --> 01:13:31.608
- I'm staying here for a while.
It's none of your business.


1378
01:13:31.652 --> 01:13:34.045
I mean, what are you doing
in your apartment?


1379
01:13:34.089 --> 01:13:36.178
- What?
- Nothing.


1380
01:13:36.222 --> 01:13:39.355
- This is highly irregular.
- You're highly irregular.


1381
01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:41.096
You kicked me
out of my apartment.


1382
01:13:41.139 --> 01:13:43.533
- Well, you didn't
give me much choice.


1383
01:13:43.577 --> 01:13:45.274
- I didn't have choices.

1384
01:13:45.318 --> 01:13:47.276
Instead I found all my stuff
on the lawn.


1385
01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.712
- What'd you expect me to do?

1386
01:13:48.756 --> 01:13:51.541
I gave you, like,
nine warnings.


1387
01:13:51.585 --> 01:13:54.196
- What do you want, Doug?

1388
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.286
-  I just found Leon's
keys outside on the lawn.


1389
01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:59.375
They want me to bring over
some of his stuff.


1390
01:13:59.419 --> 01:14:01.377
Turns out
I'm his emergency contact,


1391
01:14:01.421 --> 01:14:04.902
if you can believe it,
which is also highly irregular.


1392
01:14:04.946 --> 01:14:07.818
- Emergency contact for what?

1393
01:14:07.862 --> 01:14:12.040
- Susan, are you--
Leon's in the hospital.


1394
01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:15.173
He collapsed
in the courtyard this morning.


1395
01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:17.437
Laney found him,
had to call 911.


1396
01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.395
How do you not know
about that?


1397
01:14:21.136 --> 01:14:24.095
Susan?
Susan?


1398
01:14:24.139 --> 01:14:25.836
Everything okay in there?

1399
01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.273
You've been in there
quite a while,


1400
01:14:27.316 --> 01:14:29.362
which is highly irregular.

1401
01:14:29.405 --> 01:14:31.973
I should probably get over to
the hospital before too long.


1402
01:14:32.016 --> 01:14:34.454
Uh, I think
they're expecting someone.


1403
01:14:40.024 --> 01:14:41.025
- Hi.

1404
01:14:43.158 --> 01:14:45.334
- Hey.

1405
01:14:45.378 --> 01:14:47.815
- I would have come sooner,
but I didn't know.


1406
01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.948
- That's okay.
- I have your keys.


1407
01:14:50.992 --> 01:14:53.603
They were on the lawn.
- Thanks.


1408
01:14:53.647 --> 01:14:56.693
- I also drove your van here
because the police have my car.


1409
01:14:56.737 --> 01:15:00.349
- Oh. Okay.

1410
01:15:00.393 --> 01:15:03.265
- I also squared away your rent
for the month with Doug.


1411
01:15:03.309 --> 01:15:04.745
- You did?

1412
01:15:06.094 --> 01:15:08.314
- No, I didn't.

1413
01:15:08.357 --> 01:15:10.185
I don't know why I said that.

1414
01:15:10.228 --> 01:15:12.230
It's a lie.

1415
01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:13.797
I lie a lot.

1416
01:15:16.017 --> 01:15:18.324
- Sorry for putting you
in the hospital.


1417
01:15:18.367 --> 01:15:21.936
- It's not your fault.
It's my diabetes.


1418
01:15:21.979 --> 01:15:25.592
Probably should have had
a hit of the OJ before we...


1419
01:15:27.463 --> 01:15:30.423
- You have polio and diabetes?

1420
01:15:30.466 --> 01:15:32.555
God can be such a hater
sometimes.


1421
01:15:35.384 --> 01:15:37.430
- I brought you a few things.

1422
01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.521
- Ooh, Cassie.

1423
01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.873
Thank you.

1424
01:15:48.702 --> 01:15:52.053
- Hey, I'm in the mood
for a good joke.


1425
01:15:52.096 --> 01:15:54.142
Do you know
any good jokes, Leon?


1426
01:15:54.185 --> 01:15:58.929
- Well, I might be able
to come up with something.


1427
01:15:58.973 --> 01:16:00.801
Ah.

1428
01:16:00.844 --> 01:16:03.369
Do you know
why your butt crack


1429
01:16:03.412 --> 01:16:06.546
goes like this
and not like this?


1430
01:16:06.589 --> 01:16:08.417
- Why?

1431
01:16:08.461 --> 01:16:10.463
- 'Cause if it went like this

1432
01:16:10.506 --> 01:16:13.161
and you fell down the stairs,
you'd go...


1433
01:16:20.995 --> 01:16:23.432
- Tell me another one.

1434
01:16:23.476 --> 01:16:24.825
- Susan?

1435
01:16:27.523 --> 01:16:29.830
- Oh, good, you're back.

1436
01:16:29.873 --> 01:16:31.309
- What are you doing here?

1437
01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:32.876
- Visiting a friend.

1438
01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.704
Don't worry.
This is my little brother.


1439
01:16:34.748 --> 01:16:37.577
- Get out.
Your brother's my doctor?


1440
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.492
- Physician's assistant.

1441
01:16:41.276 --> 01:16:43.670
- Well, I have some
good news for you, Leon.


1442
01:16:43.713 --> 01:16:45.411
You're gonna get to go home
to that building soon


1443
01:16:45.454 --> 01:16:46.890
'cause we're letting you
out of here today.


1444
01:16:46.934 --> 01:16:48.544
- Oh, goody.

1445
01:16:48.588 --> 01:16:50.154
- Just promise me to be
a little better


1446
01:16:50.198 --> 01:16:52.505
about staying on top
of your blood sugar, okay?


1447
01:16:52.548 --> 01:16:54.724
And do you have anybody
who can check in on you?


1448
01:16:54.768 --> 01:16:57.335
- Yes, he does.
- Anybody responsible?


1449
01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:58.946
- Yes.
- Who?


1450
01:17:03.603 --> 01:17:05.126
- Can I see you
in the hallway, please?


1451
01:17:08.042 --> 01:17:09.870
- If you could just take
a quick look through these,


1452
01:17:09.913 --> 01:17:11.611
get your John Hancock,
we should be all set, yeah?


1453
01:17:15.571 --> 01:17:17.486
- What is your problem?
- I know what you're up to.


1454
01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:18.792
- Oh, yeah?
What am I up to?


1455
01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:20.315
- You're gonna try
to befriend him.


1456
01:17:20.358 --> 01:17:21.751
- Well, I already am
his friend, so check.


1457
01:17:21.795 --> 01:17:23.100
- Then you're gonna
figure out a way


1458
01:17:23.144 --> 01:17:24.798
to mooch off this poor guy

1459
01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:27.061
just like you do with
everyone else in your life.


1460
01:17:27.104 --> 01:17:29.193
Jesus, Susan, what the hell?

1461
01:17:29.237 --> 01:17:30.804
This is where I work,
for Christ's sake.


1462
01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:32.327
- Has it ever
occurred to you


1463
01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:33.850
that I might actually
care about him?


1464
01:17:33.894 --> 01:17:36.026
- Ha! That's the funniest thing
I've ever heard.


1465
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:37.375
You don't care
about anyone but yourself.


1466
01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.465
You never have.

1467
01:17:39.508 --> 01:17:41.162
- You know what?
You are never not an asshole.


1468
01:17:41.205 --> 01:17:43.381
- You know it's true.

1469
01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:44.948
Oh, that's nice.
Walk away.


1470
01:17:44.992 --> 01:17:46.950
Like father, like daughter,
I guess.


1471
01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:52.869
- You know what?

1472
01:17:52.913 --> 01:17:55.350
I never blamed Dad for leaving
like you and Mom always did.


1473
01:17:55.393 --> 01:17:57.831
You know why? Because it was
smart for him to leave.


1474
01:17:57.874 --> 01:17:59.528
I would have left, too,
if I wound up


1475
01:17:59.572 --> 01:18:01.791
with a fucking retarded family
like this one!


1476
01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:08.798
- It's meatloaf day
in the cafeteria.


1477
01:18:08.842 --> 01:18:10.931
Your retarded family
called to tell you about it,


1478
01:18:10.974 --> 01:18:13.324
but it went to voicemail.

1479
01:18:15.413 --> 01:18:18.547
All right, loaf time.
It's okay, sweetie.


1480
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:21.071
- Everything all right?

1481
01:18:24.727 --> 01:18:26.468
- Everything's fine.

1482
01:19:06.726 --> 01:19:08.989
- Hey.
- Hey, dude.


1483
01:19:09.032 --> 01:19:10.947
What are you doing out here?

1484
01:19:10.991 --> 01:19:13.036
- I know they can be
a little retarded.


1485
01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.951
Sometimes I wanna leave too.

1486
01:19:16.649 --> 01:19:18.607
- Don't ever do that.
They love you.


1487
01:19:18.651 --> 01:19:20.435
- They love you too.

1488
01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:33.753
- Don't say retarded.

1489
01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.636
- Jenika, don't skip
in the hospital.


1490
01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.811
Oh, hi, Susan.

1491
01:19:54.338 --> 01:19:56.340
- I'm sorry for what
I said back there.


1492
01:19:58.516 --> 01:20:00.606
But I'm not gonna say
I didn't mean it


1493
01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:03.347
because I kinda did mean it.

1494
01:20:03.391 --> 01:20:06.263
I'm happy y'all had
a fun vacation.


1495
01:20:06.307 --> 01:20:09.136
Y'all worked hard for it
and deserve it.


1496
01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:12.182
Mom, I'm sorry you picked
a favorite child


1497
01:20:12.226 --> 01:20:15.577
and that he turned out to be
a stuck-up piece of shit.


1498
01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:17.884
I'm sorry you never told me
I was awesome when I was a kid


1499
01:20:17.927 --> 01:20:19.668
even though
it would have been a lie.


1500
01:20:19.712 --> 01:20:22.192
I'm sorry you had to raise
two children on your own


1501
01:20:22.236 --> 01:20:24.412
because you married
a "selfish asshole,"


1502
01:20:24.455 --> 01:20:26.501
and I'm sorry you think
I can be a little bit


1503
01:20:26.544 --> 01:20:31.245
like him sometimes,
but the truth is...


1504
01:20:31.288 --> 01:20:33.464
I think I'm probably
a little more like you.


1505
01:20:37.164 --> 01:20:38.382
It's something I'm working on.

1506
01:20:40.907 --> 01:20:42.299
Enjoy your family meal.

1507
01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:53.093
- At least she didn't
ask for money.


1508
01:20:53.136 --> 01:20:54.964
Good lord.

1509
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.842
- You okay?

1510
01:21:05.845 --> 01:21:07.237
- Yeah.

1511
01:21:09.762 --> 01:21:11.502
Are you okay?

1512
01:21:11.546 --> 01:21:13.330
- Oh, me?
I'm good.


1513
01:21:13.374 --> 01:21:15.681
I could probably use a soda
or something


1514
01:21:15.724 --> 01:21:17.683
to get my sugar back up,

1515
01:21:17.726 --> 01:21:20.294
but I can wait till we get back
to the house for that.

- What's happening right now?

1534
01:21:58.288 --> 01:21:59.507
Phil!

1535
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:01.378
- ♪ I never felt so good

1536
01:22:01.422 --> 01:22:02.728
♪ I never felt so good

1537
01:22:02.771 --> 01:22:04.338
- You gotta pay for those.

1538
01:22:04.381 --> 01:22:06.253
- ♪ I never felt so good

1539
01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:08.211
♪ I never felt so good

1540
01:22:08.255 --> 01:22:09.647
- Well, that was weird.

1541
01:22:16.611 --> 01:22:19.048
Mmm! Nice!

1542
01:22:20.746 --> 01:22:22.617
- No, a sandwich is fine.

1543
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:31.321
What is this?

1544
01:22:31.365 --> 01:22:34.716
- VIP passes and gift
certificates to Jumpaline


1545
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.544
for you and the kids.

1546
01:22:36.587 --> 01:22:38.328
- Oh. Thanks.

1547
01:22:38.372 --> 01:22:40.896
- Um, let me know if
you want to hang sometime


1548
01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.291
or, um, you know,
if we still have a band.


1549
01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:46.772
- I don't want to go to bed!
I want a movie!


1550
01:22:46.815 --> 01:22:48.774
- The boys just made a planter
out of my ukulele,


1551
01:22:48.817 --> 01:22:51.341
so I can't even play it.

1552
01:22:51.385 --> 01:22:53.256
- Really?
Well, what did they plant?


1553
01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.954
- They said cherry pits.

1554
01:22:54.997 --> 01:22:56.999
I actually think
it might be marijuana.


1555
01:22:57.043 --> 01:22:59.959
I don't know, guess
we'll have to wait and see.


1556
01:23:00.002 --> 01:23:02.091
- Corrin, I'm losing it!
I can feel myself losing it!


1557
01:23:02.135 --> 01:23:03.571
- Okay.

1558
01:23:03.614 --> 01:23:04.964
I've gotta go
put the oops baby down,


1559
01:23:05.007 --> 01:23:06.095
so thanks for the tickets.

1560
01:23:06.139 --> 01:23:07.967
- I can do it if you want.

1561
01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:09.664
- Mommy!

1562
01:23:09.707 --> 01:23:11.100
- You want to do spider check?
- Yeah.


1563
01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:17.759
- Fine, okay.

1564
01:23:17.803 --> 01:23:20.980
Come on.
- No!


1565
01:23:21.023 --> 01:23:23.678
- Did you get a haircut?
- Yeah, last week.


1566
01:23:23.721 --> 01:23:25.158
- Yeah, it looks cute.
It's short.


1567
01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:27.029
- Yeah?
- I can see your ears.


1568
01:23:27.073 --> 01:23:28.683
- Oh, thanks, honey.

1569
01:23:28.726 --> 01:23:32.600
- I like your ears.
- Oh, good.


1570
01:23:32.643 --> 01:23:35.124
- You wanna get high?
- I do.


1571
01:23:35.168 --> 01:23:36.996
Do you have any?
- I do.


1572
01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:42.262
- No spiders in there.

1573
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:48.746
- Oh, no spiders
in there either.


1574
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.487
- Susan, look under the desk.

1575
01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:57.190
Kyle has her head.

1576
01:23:57.233 --> 01:23:59.279
- Well, don't ever lose
your head over a man.


1577
01:24:01.498 --> 01:24:04.153
- What's this?

1578
01:24:04.197 --> 01:24:07.113
It's a tickle spider, ooh!

1579
01:24:07.156 --> 01:24:09.898
- Susan!

1580
01:24:12.379 --> 01:24:13.946
- Uh-huh.

1581
01:24:16.078 --> 01:24:18.167
- I'm also very creative,

1582
01:24:18.211 --> 01:24:22.302
and I can do percentages
in my head.


1583
01:24:22.345 --> 01:24:24.434
- Is there anything else
Kmart should know about you


1584
01:24:24.478 --> 01:24:25.958
before we conclude
this interview?


1585
01:24:29.962 --> 01:24:32.007
All right then.

1586
01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:36.620
- Just...

1587
01:24:39.232 --> 01:24:43.279
Just that I've always
been jealous of you


1588
01:24:43.323 --> 01:24:46.935
because your life always
seemed so perfect, you know?


1589
01:24:46.979 --> 01:24:50.199
You always seem so happy,

1590
01:24:50.243 --> 01:24:52.810
and you're so pretty,

1591
01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.769
and in high school

1592
01:24:54.812 --> 01:24:57.424
you were in that commercial
for Mattress Giant.


1593
01:24:57.467 --> 01:25:00.601
- You saw that?
- Yeah.


1594
01:25:00.644 --> 01:25:03.821
It was always on during
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer."


1595
01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.649
- I love that show.
- I know, me too.


1596
01:25:11.917 --> 01:25:13.962
Are those flowers
from your boyfriend?


1597
01:25:14.006 --> 01:25:16.356
- Yeah.

1598
01:25:16.399 --> 01:25:18.140
- You're so lucky.

1599
01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:24.233
- They're actually
from my mom.


1600
01:25:24.277 --> 01:25:26.540
My boyfriend broke up
with me, so...


1601
01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:29.064
- Oh, I'm s--

1602
01:25:29.108 --> 01:25:31.066
When?
- A year and a half ago.


1603
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:33.460
He was addicted to some girl
on a porn website, you know?


1604
01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.462
Whatever.

1605
01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:37.507
- What a bastard.

1606
01:25:37.551 --> 01:25:39.205
- I see you left
the box unchecked for


1607
01:25:39.248 --> 01:25:41.511
"Have you ever been
convicted of a crime?"


1608
01:25:41.555 --> 01:25:44.819
- Yes, I, as of now,

1609
01:25:44.862 --> 01:25:46.995
technically never have been
convicted of a crime.


1610
01:25:47.039 --> 01:25:49.911
However, I do have
an upcoming court date.


1611
01:25:49.955 --> 01:25:52.000
- That's okay, Susan.
I know all about it.


1612
01:25:52.044 --> 01:25:55.090
- You do?
- I saw you on the news.


1613
01:25:55.134 --> 01:25:57.223
- I was on the news?

1614
01:26:01.662 --> 01:26:03.185
I posted your bail.

1615
01:26:07.015 --> 01:26:09.539
- Why?
- I don't know.


1616
01:26:11.324 --> 01:26:14.153
Look, Phil Conklin's
a slimy little dick.


1617
01:26:14.196 --> 01:26:17.286
I'm sure he had it coming.
- You know Phil?


1618
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:19.114
- I made the mistake
of going on one date with him


1619
01:26:19.158 --> 01:26:20.594
when I was rebounding.

1620
01:26:20.637 --> 01:26:21.987
I should have known
he was no good


1621
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:23.597
when he "accidentally"
hit my car.


1622
01:26:25.599 --> 01:26:27.427
- Motherfucker.

1623
01:26:29.733 --> 01:26:33.346
Uh, well, I'll--
I'll pay you back.


1624
01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:35.087
- Money well spent.

1625
01:26:39.395 --> 01:26:41.049
- Thank you.

1626
01:26:41.093 --> 01:26:45.140
- Thank you for showing
interest in Kmart.


1627
01:26:45.184 --> 01:26:48.013
- Mm-hmm.

1628
01:26:48.056 --> 01:26:50.319
- You'll be hearing from us
in a couple of days.


1629
01:26:56.108 --> 01:26:58.197
- Hey, baby, wake up.
Hey, baby, wake up.


1630
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.721
Hey, baby, wake up.
