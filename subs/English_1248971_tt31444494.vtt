00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.942
- Cover 2.
- Cover 2.

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:44.942
[all] Ready! Break!

6
00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:48.108
Shawn, do not
screw this up for me.


7
00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.442
- Yeah.
- [man 1] Orlando strong.


8
00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:52.067
[man 1] Orlando strong!
Orlando strong!


9
00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:53.483
Wrong motto.

10
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.567
- Left side.
- Easy.


11
00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:57.608
Cover left! Cover left!

12
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.400
Left deep, deep, go!

13
00:01:00.358 --> 00:01:02.233
No, it's Oklahoma!
Go Okkie!


14
00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:05.025
Go Okkie!
Go Okkie! Okkie!


15
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.900
- Okkie!
- Okkie, Okkie!


16
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.108
Let's go!

17
00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:12.025
[grunting]

18
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:19.983
Right off, boy.
That's it!


19
00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:23.692
- Nice job.
- Let's go.


20
00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:29.900
Two hundred pound male, signs
of smoke inhalation, weak pulse.


21
00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:31.025
I'm getting him out now!

22
00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:32.942
[grunting]

23
00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:40.067
[panting and grunting]

24
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.650
- Charging the line!
- [woman 1] Charged!


25
00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:58.150
- Nice.
- [clapping]


26
00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:00.692
Woo-hoo!

27
00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:06.400
- Shawn?
- Yeah.


28
00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:07.733
Let's talk.

29
00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:11.418
[man 1] Hey, not a bad day, man,
not a bad day.


30
00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:12.608
[man 2] Thanks guys.

31
00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:17.192
So... why do you wanna be
on this team?


32
00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:19.983
[laughs] To compete, sir.

33
00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:21.733
I've-I've wanted
to play for Westmorland


34
00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.317
since I was throwing peewee.

35
00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.233
I mean, I-I need to get better,
but any time I'm on that field,


36
00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:28.442
I just, I feel like my best.

37
00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.275
Well said. I've been watching
you this season.


38
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.317
You have an eye for ball
and attention


39
00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:34.751
for detail
and that gives you an edge.


40
00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.067
Well, I-I watch a lot of film
of pro games


41
00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:38.525
and I study their plays.

42
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.525
And that's exactly
the kind of discipline


43
00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:42.942
that makes you
a strong fit for the team.


44
00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:45.567
- You feel ready for this season?
- Yes, sir.


45
00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:48.525
Good, because you're gonna be
starting next week.


46
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.275
[laughs]
Oh, I...


47
00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:52.858
[Shawn] I don't know
what to say.


48
00:02:52.942 --> 00:02:54.775
Thank you, coach, thank you!

49
00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:56.358
You keep honing those instincts

50
00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.067
and don't let me down.

51
00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.900
Yes, sir, I won't.

52
00:03:00.108 --> 00:03:01.525
Thanks, coach.

53
00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:08.358
[Woodley] Yo, Martins.

54
00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:09.793
You went against my call
out there.


55
00:03:09.817 --> 00:03:11.858
Uh, I know, uh...

56
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:15.275
I just, I saw what was
happening, and I had to act.


57
00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:17.567
Hm. Well, look now that you're
starting


58
00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:19.400
we got to figure out
clear signals.


59
00:03:19.483 --> 00:03:20.942
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

60
00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.233
I-I'm pumped
to get a closer look at


61
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.817
all of you guys work.

62
00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:26.942
Okay.

63
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.751
Hey, there's big blowout
at Jenkins place tonight.


64
00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:35.650
[Woodley] His parents are
out of town.


65
00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:38.400
Pre-gamer at my place.

66
00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:41.942
I-I gotta a couple things
happening...


67
00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:44.483
but, yeah, yeah, 
I'll be there.

68
00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:45.709
[Woodley] Only if you can
make time in your


69
00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:48.192
oh-so-busy schedule,
that'd be great.


70
00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:50.983
And no JVs'.

71
00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:52.192
Don't bring any.

72
00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.817
Cool, yeah, yeah, cool.

73
00:03:55.942 --> 00:03:56.942
Cool.

74
00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:02.733
Dismissed, Martins.
What are you doing?


75
00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:07.358
["I'm in it" playing]

76
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400
Hey, Shawn?

77
00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:28.233
[Lucinda] Shawn?

78
00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:35.567
[laughs]

79
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.084
Um, some would say
that's child abuse.


80
00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:40.275
Oh please. It's the only way to
get your attention.


81
00:04:40.358 --> 00:04:41.650
Are those for me?

82
00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:43.233
- You're so sweet.
- Get out of here!


83
00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:44.817
And wash those grubby hands.

84
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.501
Cara and Lauren are coming over
here for Fat Friday.


85
00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:48.067
But Cara's cooking, right?

86
00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.817
Rude. But, yes.

87
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.567
- How was practice?
- Three tackles for a loss.


88
00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:54.400
- Not bad.
- It's better than not bad!


89
00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:57.233
I'd like to see you take on
a 175 pound bag of meat.


90
00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:58.817
Been there, done that.

91
00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:01.400
- Oh, gross.
- For work!


92
00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:03.400
God, get your mind
out of the gutter.


93
00:05:03.525 --> 00:05:06.275
["I'm in it" playing]

94
00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:11.567
That was so good.

95
00:05:11.608 --> 00:05:13.150
Can we do Fat Friday
every night?


96
00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.567
You know, you may be bigger
than both my ex-husbands,


97
00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:16.709
but you eat
like a three year old.


98
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.567
- Aww, thanks, Cara.
- Mom?


99
00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:20.107
What? Shawn's fine with it!

100
00:05:20.108 --> 00:05:21.567
I used to change
this boy's diapers.


101
00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:23.150
- Ew.
- Ew, I didn't need to know that.


102
00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:24.400
Oh, look at them fuss!

103
00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:25.442
Shall we pull out
their bath photos?


104
00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:27.067
- Mom!
- [Lucinda] What?


105
00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:29.293
I'm glad you came by the salon.
I don't know how you are playing


106
00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:30.626
football with all that hair
in your face.


107
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.525
Well, I like it like that, so...

108
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.025
It barely fit under your helmet.

109
00:05:33.108 --> 00:05:34.942
Oh, has someone been
watching me practice?


110
00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:37.400
Uh, it's hard to avoid
when the band faces the field.


111
00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:39.942
- [Lucinda] Oh.
- Hey, hey, hey!


112
00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:42.650
Okay. Okay, hey, enough.

113
00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:44.001
I think it's time for
a Thorn and Rose?


114
00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:45.858
- [Lucinda] Yes!
- Mom, no. That's so forced.


115
00:05:45.942 --> 00:05:48.001
- Please. We're too old for that.
- It's called sharing, sweetie.


116
00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:49.650
Watch your tongue. I am not old.

117
00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:52.358
- Um, I'll go first.
- Okay.


118
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.942
Okay, so, um, my thorn

119
00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:58.567
would be losing my top score
in Halo, because that sucks.


120
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.692
- Oh, God, who am I raising?
- [Cara laughs]


121
00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:02.483
But my rose...

122
00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.525
is making first string.

123
00:06:04.608 --> 00:06:06.900
- What? What?
- [Cara] Oh, what?


124
00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:08.900
You're looking at
Westmoreland's newest starter.


125
00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:11.150
And you waited
this long to tell me?


126
00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:13.209
As somebody that doesn't speak
football, I need a translator.


127
00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:15.775
Uh, translation,
Shawn is a big shot.


128
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.733
- [Cara] Oh.
- What it actually means...


129
00:06:17.817 --> 00:06:19.733
is that I'll get to
start the game,


130
00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:21.942
which means more competitive
play, more attention


131
00:06:22.108 --> 00:06:23.817
at practice,
and I'll get better faster.


132
00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:25.942
- I'm so proud of you.
- If I don't mess things up.


133
00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:27.442
- So...
- You won't.


134
00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:28.900
- Cheers.
- Way to go, sweetie.


135
00:06:28.983 --> 00:06:31.400
- Cheers.
- [clinking]


136
00:06:31.483 --> 00:06:34.275
I was, uh, also invited
to a seniors party tonight.


137
00:06:34.442 --> 00:06:36.692
- [Cara] A seniors party.
- Ew.


138
00:06:36.817 --> 00:06:38.400
- What?
- No.


139
00:06:38.483 --> 00:06:40.983
I'm sorry, what was that?
You want to come?


140
00:06:41.108 --> 00:06:42.668
Uh, how do you know
I'm not already coming?


141
00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:44.650
Okay, so who's the big shot now?
Stop.


142
00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:47.692
Hey, no roughhousing
at the table! Hey!


143
00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:49.067
[Lucinda] Stop.

144
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.775
- He started it.
- It was her.


145
00:06:50.858 --> 00:06:52.400
Shut up.

146
00:06:52.483 --> 00:06:53.563
[Lauren] He's hitting hard.

147
00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:55.442
- I know.
- You're ridiculous.


148
00:06:58.567 --> 00:06:59.567
You guys are terrible.

149
00:06:59.692 --> 00:07:01.733
- Hey.
- Oh, this is good.


150
00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:04.358
Yo, Martin's the new
starting man.


151
00:07:04.442 --> 00:07:05.733
- There he is.
- Hey, JV.


152
00:07:05.817 --> 00:07:08.817
You want to show up
to my house, empty-handed?


153
00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:12.400
- Oh, I, I didn't.
- I'm kidding. Relax, man. Relax.


154
00:07:12.442 --> 00:07:15.233
Tyler, here's your bottle.
Open wide, Martin.


155
00:07:15.317 --> 00:07:17.858
Don't stop drinking until
Mason here calls the plays.

with targets?

Do you know that girl?

No. Yeah. I

go to our school?

Yeah, man. They all do.

180

[Shawn] This is

Hey, I slammed
that one last week.

[Tyler] Whatever,
I've filled that.

[Mason] No, you haven't, bro.
[Tyler] Have too.


186
00:08:22.858 --> 00:08:24.733
- Woodley, go to her page.
- Guys, look.


187
00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:26.192
Focus, okay?

188
00:08:26.317 --> 00:08:27.774
We're here
for tonight's targets.


189

know about this?

- Come on. Look.


193
00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:39.067
You know, Shawnee,
I'm kind of letting you in


194
00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:41.733
on something special here.
You know what I mean?


195
00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:44.442
So don't go blabbing your hole
to everybody at school.


196
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:47.233
It'd be fantastic, if you
keep this between us


197
00:08:47.317 --> 00:08:49.025
and the other hunters,
all right?


198
00:08:49.108 --> 00:08:50.775
The other hunters?

199
00:08:50.942 --> 00:08:53.358
Yeah, man.
Guys from the other schools.

Fresh targets just dropped.

205
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.501
[Woodley] Hey, these girls are
gonna be at the party tonight,


206
00:09:06.525 --> 00:09:08.317
so first we review,

207
00:09:08.442 --> 00:09:09.525
then we hunt.

208
00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:12.025
What do you mean, hunt?

209
00:09:12.108 --> 00:09:13.942
The name of the game is
nudes, all right?


210
00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:16.900
Now, you can acquire them
by any means necessary.


211
00:09:16.942 --> 00:09:19.483
And you post them on site
if you want access to


212
00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:21.775
everyone else's stock.

213
00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:23.942
So it's like a porn library.

215
00:09:25.317 --> 00:09:27.900
No, man.
Dude, this is so much more.


216
00:09:27.983 --> 00:09:30.608
Look, this, this is personal,
all right?


217
00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:32.855
I mean, you can do trades,
sometimes there's bounties


218
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.733
for specific chicks,
whatever you want.


219
00:09:34.817 --> 00:09:36.733
I mean, I myself,

220
00:09:36.817 --> 00:09:38.067
I like a lady in uniform.

- Yes, he is. Yes, he is.

Everybody's flavor is welcome.

223
00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:45.983
So then any guy can
just log on and comment?


224
00:09:46.108 --> 00:09:48.067
Martin, do you think
we're idiots, man?


225
00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:50.567
- No. No. I just...
- Yeah, you just thought?

No, you're not thinking, man.

brought you down here if I


234
00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:13.567
didn't think you'd hack it.

235

I'll tell you what.
Lay low tonight. Okay?

I'm a prince.

to wear that thing?

About a month or so.

Okay. Um, well, I do think maybe
we should take a break.

- Okay.
- Just keep things really casual.

Yeah, no, we were. I...

00:30:57.233 --> 00:30:58.942
- I mean, yeah.
- Yeah.


628
00:30:59.067 --> 00:31:00.900
- So you're our in, man.
- Yeah.


629
00:31:00.983 --> 00:31:02.233
[Tyler] Yeah, bro.

630
00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:04.858
[chuckles] I, I guess.

631
00:31:04.983 --> 00:31:06.168
[Woodley] Martins, listen to me.

632
00:31:06.192 --> 00:31:08.233
The training wheels?
They're gone.


633
00:31:08.317 --> 00:31:09.941
- Take 'em off.
- [Woodley] All right.


634
00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:12.858
You're gonna take the lead on
this one. Unless...


635
00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.900
you don't think you got
what it takes.


636
00:31:19.275 --> 00:31:21.608
[scoffs] O-of course, yeah.

637
00:31:21.692 --> 00:31:23.650
Ah, he's got it. He's got it.

638
00:31:23.775 --> 00:31:26.942
My man Martins, what did I say?
He always delivers.


639
00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:29.900
His knee may be busted
but the rest of him works...


640
00:31:29.983 --> 00:31:30.983
just fine.

641
00:31:31.025 --> 00:31:32.192
It's working good.

642
00:31:32.275 --> 00:31:34.192
[all laughing]

643
00:31:34.275 --> 00:31:35.475
He's out of control, this guy.

644
00:31:37.192 --> 00:31:38.567
[Tyler] Legend.
[Woodley] No, man.


645
00:31:38.692 --> 00:31:40.942
Undefeated on the field,
in life...


646
00:31:41.025 --> 00:31:42.858
- [whistles] On HNTD.
- On HNTD.


647
00:31:42.983 --> 00:31:44.608
[Woodley laughs] Come on, man.

648
00:31:44.692 --> 00:31:46.983
We're undefeated everywhere.

649
00:31:51.858 --> 00:31:53.607
[Lucinda] We've always
reconnected by joking around


650
00:31:53.608 --> 00:31:54.968
but lately he's just been
so sulky.


651
00:31:55.067 --> 00:31:57.400
Oh, well, you're his mom.
It's kind of his birth right.


652
00:31:57.525 --> 00:31:58.834
I think that girl
broke up with him.


653
00:31:58.858 --> 00:32:00.442
- Oh, poor Shawn.
- Yeah. Did Lauren say


654
00:32:00.525 --> 00:32:02.192
- anything about it?
- No, not to me


655
00:32:02.275 --> 00:32:03.501
What's the point of our kids
being friends


656
00:32:03.525 --> 00:32:04.233
if we can't siphon off

657
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.858
information from both sides?

658
00:32:05.942 --> 00:32:07.400
[laughs] Tell me about it.

659
00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.251
When they were tiny,
we had that con down pat.


660
00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:11.817
It's the only way I ever found
Shawn's third grade report card.


661
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.275
Oh, yeah. Remember?

662
00:32:13.358 --> 00:32:15.567
He hid at my house. So sneaky.

663
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.692
Oh, that was basically
his home in those days.


664
00:32:17.817 --> 00:32:19.067
Yeah.

665
00:32:19.108 --> 00:32:21.108
God, you watched him for
so many of my overnights.


666
00:32:21.233 --> 00:32:22.483
- Yeah.
- I'd offer my firstborn


667
00:32:22.567 --> 00:32:24.251
in repayment,
but he's a moody piece of work.


668
00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:26.358
Hey, get over it.
They're teenagers.


669
00:32:26.483 --> 00:32:29.400
They will grow out of it.
That's why we drink.


670
00:32:29.567 --> 00:32:31.400
- Mm-hmm.
- [laughs]


671
00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:33.668
Yeah, but Lauren actually
opens up to you about her stuff.


672
00:32:33.692 --> 00:32:36.358
Yeah, she's also iced me
out many, many times.


673
00:32:36.483 --> 00:32:38.233
- Just keep at it with him.
- I will.


674
00:32:38.275 --> 00:32:41.150
But when he doesn't talk to me,
I end up feeling so stupid.


675
00:32:41.233 --> 00:32:42.459
And then I go into
a shame spiral,


676
00:32:42.483 --> 00:32:44.083
and I wonder if things
would be different


677
00:32:44.108 --> 00:32:45.209
if his dad was around, you know,

678
00:32:45.233 --> 00:32:46.733
to talk to him about...

679
00:32:46.817 --> 00:32:50.400
sex, porn, stuff with girls.
I-I'm in over my head.


680
00:32:50.525 --> 00:32:52.733
Hey, hey, Luz,
this is not a failure.


681
00:32:52.817 --> 00:32:54.733
This is normal.

682
00:32:54.858 --> 00:32:58.733
You're doing the best you can,
and Shawn, he's a great kid.


683
00:32:58.817 --> 00:33:00.067
You did good.

684
00:33:00.192 --> 00:33:03.150
You are an amazing
single mom, and...


685
00:33:03.275 --> 00:33:06.233
If I was hanging off a cliff,
I'd want you holding the rope.


686
00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:09.108
- Does that work out?
- [laughs]


687
00:33:09.275 --> 00:33:10.942
Because I know
that you'd go over


688
00:33:11.025 --> 00:33:12.317
before you ever let me fall.

689
00:33:12.442 --> 00:33:14.275
You're that committed
to the people you love.


690
00:33:14.358 --> 00:33:16.941
- Thank you.
- Anytime.


691
00:33:16.942 --> 00:33:18.858
Now, let me deal
with these split ends,


692
00:33:18.942 --> 00:33:21.400
because, wow, it's like you
go through fire for a living.


693
00:33:21.483 --> 00:33:23.317
[laughing]

694
00:33:23.442 --> 00:33:25.067
So, we're on route
to a call today,


695
00:33:25.275 --> 00:33:27.543
and I keep hearing this strange
noise behind the fire truck...


696
00:33:27.567 --> 00:33:29.317
- Can I grab that salsa?
- Yeah.


697
00:33:29.442 --> 00:33:31.442
Turns out our pump operator
didn't secure the hose,


698
00:33:31.567 --> 00:33:33.942
and we dragged it,
like, half a block.


699
00:33:34.025 --> 00:33:36.733
So, now the crew's
nicknamed him the Streaker.


700
00:33:36.817 --> 00:33:38.358
Why?

701
00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:41.358
Because he drove down
main street with his hose out.


702
00:33:41.442 --> 00:33:43.525
[all laughing]

703
00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:47.233
Hey, what if I joined band?

704
00:33:47.317 --> 00:33:49.942
- [Lucinda] What?
- What?


705
00:33:50.025 --> 00:33:51.858
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.


706
00:33:51.983 --> 00:33:53.983
Um, but you don't play
an instrument.


707
00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:57.275
- I play guitar.
- Oh, okay, so you're mocking me.


708
00:33:57.442 --> 00:34:00.150
No, absolutely not.
I am genuinely interested.


709
00:34:00.275 --> 00:34:02.317
Okay, well, I hate to
break it to you,


710
00:34:02.442 --> 00:34:05.233
but we actually do march,
like, with your knees.


711
00:34:05.358 --> 00:34:07.275
- Be nice.
- Right.


712
00:34:07.358 --> 00:34:10.275
Okay, then what if I
come to your parties?


713
00:34:10.442 --> 00:34:12.067
What kind of parties
are you expecting?


714
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.084
I don't know if I can say
that in front of the moms.


715
00:34:14.108 --> 00:34:15.607
- Ooh.
- Hey, yes, you can. Yes.


716
00:34:15.608 --> 00:34:17.248
Lauren tells me all
about her social life.


717
00:34:17.317 --> 00:34:18.525
- Oh.
- Oh, do I? [laughs]


718
00:34:18.608 --> 00:34:22.317
Well, in that case,
I expect tons of baking


719
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.775
and instrumental renditions
of Taylor Swift.


720
00:34:24.942 --> 00:34:27.025
- [Lucinda] Shawn?
- You really got us figured out.


721
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.316
[Shawn] Oh, come on.

722
00:34:28.317 --> 00:34:30.858
Okay, what's the
angle here, Shawn?


723
00:34:30.983 --> 00:34:33.567
There's no angle.
I'm just, uh...


724
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.358
I wanna do something
that's not sitting on a bench.


725
00:34:36.442 --> 00:34:38.692
Well, that makes a lot of sense,
hon, and I think


726
00:34:38.817 --> 00:34:40.043
it's sweet you wanna join band.

727
00:34:40.067 --> 00:34:41.108
- Yeah.
- You see.


728
00:34:41.192 --> 00:34:42.858
No, please don't encourage him.

729
00:34:42.942 --> 00:34:45.302
I think it's sweet, especially
because he can't play guitar.


730
00:34:45.358 --> 00:34:46.626
- So I think it's sweet.
- Whatever.


731
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.317
[Lucinda]
You cannot play guitar.


732
00:34:48.442 --> 00:34:50.442
[Cara] That's just
what we're gonna do.


733
00:34:50.608 --> 00:34:52.692
So you see the pic
I posted of the tuba player?


734
00:34:52.817 --> 00:34:54.900
Yeah, the one with the tattoos?

735
00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:57.900
I did. Mind-blown.

736
00:34:57.942 --> 00:34:59.567
Hey, check it out.
I got St. Francis


737
00:34:59.733 --> 00:35:01.567
to refine the
rules of the challenge.


738
00:35:01.608 --> 00:35:04.275
I'm gonna make things a bit
more, uh, interesting.


739
00:35:04.358 --> 00:35:06.067
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


740
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.525
Moving to a point-based system.

741
00:35:07.608 --> 00:35:09.567
The harder the chick,
the higher the score.


742
00:35:09.692 --> 00:35:11.567
- Who's ranking?
- All the guys in HNTD


743
00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:12.900
are gonna rank each pic.

744
00:35:13.067 --> 00:35:15.400
Top score next Friday
takes the game.


745
00:35:15.483 --> 00:35:18.900
- Ready to go?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, one-one sec.


746
00:35:19.067 --> 00:35:20.483
Hey. I'm Woodley.

747
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.358
Uh, I know who you are.

748
00:35:23.483 --> 00:35:25.733
- And you are?
- Lauren.


749
00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:28.233
Lauren. I can't believe
we haven't officially met yet.


750
00:35:28.275 --> 00:35:29.475
How do you two know each other?

751
00:35:29.525 --> 00:35:32.900
Um, neighbors.
Our moms hang out.


752
00:35:33.025 --> 00:35:34.525
That's cute.

753
00:35:34.608 --> 00:35:37.442
- You play the drums?
- Yeah, I do.


754
00:35:37.608 --> 00:35:39.251
Well, listen, on behalf of
the entire football team,


755
00:35:39.275 --> 00:35:40.733
I gotta tell you, thank you

756
00:35:40.775 --> 00:35:43.400
for getting the crowd pumped up
every night like you do.


757
00:35:43.483 --> 00:35:44.900
Between you and me,
I think the band


758
00:35:45.067 --> 00:35:47.150
does a better job
than the cheerleaders.


759
00:35:48.233 --> 00:35:50.067
Okay. Thanks.

760
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.192
Um, I'm gonna hit up my locker,
but I'll meet you at the car.


761
00:35:53.275 --> 00:35:54.525
You got it.

762
00:35:58.733 --> 00:36:03.233
Dude, she is hiding some hot
goods underneath that band fit.


763
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.025
Dream on, dude.
She's not that type.


764
00:36:05.108 --> 00:36:06.900
That's what makes it
so much more fun.


765
00:36:06.942 --> 00:36:10.650
Martins, that right there,
that's a trophy hunt.


766
00:36:10.733 --> 00:36:13.692
- Nah, man. Definitely not.
- What are you...


767
00:36:13.775 --> 00:36:15.400
Oh, I see what's going on.

768
00:36:15.442 --> 00:36:17.400
Wanna keep your hot friend
all to yourself?


769
00:36:17.567 --> 00:36:19.567
I have news for you, Martins.

770
00:36:19.692 --> 00:36:21.483
I'm putting a target
on that ass.


771
00:36:21.608 --> 00:36:23.567
- Man, don't.
- Look, if you don't wanna hunt


772
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.817
her, someone else will, right?

773
00:36:26.733 --> 00:36:28.108
Come on, pal.

774
00:36:28.275 --> 00:36:31.150
Don't you wanna see
your team go to glory, huh?


775
00:36:31.233 --> 00:36:34.650
Relax. It's just a game, eh?

776
00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:36.150
She'll never know.

777
00:36:39.442 --> 00:36:40.442
Woo!

778
00:36:41.567 --> 00:36:42.567
[Woodley] Gabby!

779
00:36:52.442 --> 00:36:53.817
- Thanks.
- Yeah.


780
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.483
So, I don't know
what's going on,


781
00:36:55.567 --> 00:36:57.442
but all my friends
are getting action.


782
00:36:57.525 --> 00:36:59.150
Aw, feeling left out?

783
00:36:59.233 --> 00:37:00.953
No, I just think it's funny,
you know, like,


784
00:37:01.108 --> 00:37:03.567
all of a sudden, band girls are
the hot center of attention,


785
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.692
and, like, football bros
are buzzing around.


786
00:37:05.817 --> 00:37:07.418
Yeah, maybe they all
watched "American Pie."


787
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:11.275
No, Woodley is way too busy
watching himself in the mirror.


788
00:37:11.442 --> 00:37:13.442
Yeah, you're not wrong.

789
00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:15.900
How's it going with those guys?

790
00:37:15.942 --> 00:37:17.942
- Woodley and them?
- Yeah.


791
00:37:18.025 --> 00:37:19.233
Them.

792
00:37:19.358 --> 00:37:20.567
It's fine.

793
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.317
But since your knee got
messed up,


794
00:37:22.442 --> 00:37:23.733
they still been cool with you?

795
00:37:24.608 --> 00:37:25.858
Yeah, actually.

796
00:37:27.108 --> 00:37:28.692
Especially Woodley.

797
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.900
I mean, yeah, I'm still

798
00:37:31.025 --> 00:37:32.733
on the sidelines looking in,

799
00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:36.525
but... I get to party
with them after practice,


800
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.067
so at least that's something.

801
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.733
I'd lose my mind watching
the band play without me.


802
00:37:40.817 --> 00:37:42.543
No, please don't.
You're already crazy enough.


803
00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:43.733
"Ha-ha!"

804
00:37:43.942 --> 00:37:46.067
Just want to be out there
with them, you know?


805
00:37:46.233 --> 00:37:47.608
Yeah, I get that.

806
00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:50.775
Hey, what if I drive us home?

807
00:37:50.858 --> 00:37:52.483
Won't your,
like, knee freeze up?


808
00:37:52.608 --> 00:37:54.692
- Only one way to find out.
- Okay.


809
00:37:55.358 --> 00:37:56.358
[chuckles]

810
00:37:58.317 --> 00:37:59.733
- Don't tell my mom.
- Um...


811
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.860
As long as you don't,
Lucinda would kill me first.


812
00:38:01.942 --> 00:38:03.317
She probably would.

813
00:38:06.483 --> 00:38:07.483
What?

814
00:38:09.275 --> 00:38:11.275
Take my crutch.

815
00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:13.775
Now, you're just milking it
for all it's worth.


816
00:38:17.108 --> 00:38:19.817
When are you introducing me to
these hot band friends of yours?


817
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.442
Oh, my God. Don't make me
hit you with this.


818
00:38:22.525 --> 00:38:24.192
- Oh, no.
- Stop.


819
00:38:24.942 --> 00:38:27.650
[hip-hop music playing]

820
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400
Hey, Shawn.

821
00:38:40.608 --> 00:38:42.233
Shawn?

822
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.817
- What?
- You hungry?


823
00:38:43.942 --> 00:38:46.358
Uh, no. I microwaved
a burrito earlier.


824
00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:49.400
Okay, then.

825
00:38:49.525 --> 00:38:50.900
[sighs]

826
00:38:50.942 --> 00:38:52.567
What are you working on?

827
00:38:52.733 --> 00:38:55.067
- Huh?
- What is that?


828
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.817
It's, uh, a playlist for Lauren.

829
00:38:57.942 --> 00:38:59.358
Oh, can I listen?

830
00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:02.567
I mean, you wouldn't like it.

831
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.567
It's what you call
headache music.


832
00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.150
[laughs] Right.

833
00:39:06.233 --> 00:39:08.733
I guess I can be real ass
about your music, huh?


834
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.400
It's whatever. I mean, I don't
listen to Madonna,


835
00:39:11.442 --> 00:39:12.983
so I guess we're even.

836
00:39:18.275 --> 00:39:21.067
You know you could talk to me
about anything, right?


837
00:39:23.775 --> 00:39:25.275
Yeah. I know.

838
00:39:27.858 --> 00:39:30.983
- I, I gotta finish this, so...
- Yeah. Of course.


839
00:39:32.942 --> 00:39:35.022
Well, let me know if you
change your mind about food.


840
00:39:47.983 --> 00:39:49.733
[dog barking in distance]

841
00:40:00.775 --> 00:40:02.900
[knocking]

842
00:40:09.692 --> 00:40:11.400
And to what do I
owe the pleasure?


843
00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:13.817
- You weren't answering my texts.
- I was in the shower.


844
00:40:13.942 --> 00:40:15.483
You know
I like to go to bed fresh.


845
00:40:15.608 --> 00:40:17.150
- You're weird.
- [Lauren laughs]


846
00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:19.692
Did you see the playlist I sent?

847
00:40:19.775 --> 00:40:21.775
- You made me a mix?
- I did.


848
00:40:21.858 --> 00:40:23.650
- Do you have your phone?
- No.


849
00:40:23.733 --> 00:40:26.067
Uh, here. Look at mine.

850
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.150
Oh, my...

851
00:40:28.983 --> 00:40:31.733
And, uh, don't be
a music snob about it.


852
00:40:31.817 --> 00:40:33.775
There's more top 40
than you're used to,


853
00:40:33.858 --> 00:40:35.192
but it's what I've been
listening


854
00:40:35.275 --> 00:40:36.692
to while doing my rehab
exercises.


855
00:40:36.775 --> 00:40:39.442
And some of the songs
made me think of you.


856
00:40:41.817 --> 00:40:43.733
That was a very
self-conscious answer.


857
00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:45.483
- Shut up.
- I'm kidding.


858
00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:46.733
I'm sure I'll love it.

859
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.192
- Good.
- I'm gonna go listen to it now.


860
00:40:49.275 --> 00:40:50.275
Okay.

861
00:40:51.733 --> 00:40:52.817
Huh?

862
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.733
- Uh...
- Uh...


863
00:40:57.775 --> 00:40:58.942
Sorry. I...

864
00:40:59.942 --> 00:41:01.233
I thought, uh...

865
00:41:01.317 --> 00:41:02.733
No.

866
00:41:02.858 --> 00:41:04.942
- Sorry. No, no, no. I...
- Yeah, uh, yeah, uh...


867
00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:06.733
- It's fine.
- Sorry. No, no, no. I...


868
00:41:06.858 --> 00:41:09.317
- I don't... I-I...
- No, it-t's fine.


869
00:41:09.442 --> 00:41:11.084
- Like I don't, it's okay, but...
- Forget it.


870
00:41:11.108 --> 00:41:13.858
- I-I just, I don't feel...
- It's fine. Forget it. Uh...


871
00:41:13.983 --> 00:41:15.483
Just, uh, forget it.

872
00:41:19.858 --> 00:41:20.983
Shawn, um...

873
00:41:25.442 --> 00:41:26.442
your phone.

[indistinct chatter]

875
00:41:54.775 --> 00:41:56.608
Hey, where are
we going for lunch?


876
00:41:57.942 --> 00:41:59.483
Hey, you guys heading to lunch?

877
00:41:59.608 --> 00:42:02.400
Uh, food sucks today, man.
We're going to the plaza.


878
00:42:02.483 --> 00:42:04.233
Smart. Can I catch a ride?

879
00:42:04.317 --> 00:42:05.400
[sighs]

880
00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:07.108
Car's full.

881
00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:08.567
Hey, Shawnee, listen.

882
00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:12.692
If I don't see the one
I'm hunting soon,


883
00:42:12.817 --> 00:42:14.942
I'm sending Mason
to do your job.


884
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.150
Okay?

885
00:42:17.233 --> 00:42:18.941
That makes sense, all right.

886
00:42:18.942 --> 00:42:20.025
All right.

887
00:42:21.108 --> 00:42:24.233
Hey, Martins,
enjoy lunch today, man.


888
00:42:24.317 --> 00:42:26.108
- It's gonna be a good one.
- See ya.

- [knocking on door]
- [Lucinda] Shawn, I'm home.

00:45:15.067 --> 00:45:16.150
I'm sleeping.

[Lucinda] Okay, goodnight, then.

Chill, chill, chill, chill.

You guys want
the whole school to know?

Martins, I gotta say,
I'm proud of you.

For a second there,
thought you were all talk.

our prize, huh?

there's a party on Friday.

North Collegiate.
Gotta rub it in.

Tell me you're coming.
I, I have my surgery that day.

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:00.626
I'm gonna be messed up
on painkillers.


918
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.150
North is a stoner school.
Those girls will love it.

I mean, Shawn,
this band bitch is fire.


920
00:47:06.817 --> 00:47:09.275
What instrument do you have to
play to get a booty like that?

- Am I right, guys?
- [all exclaiming]


922
00:47:10.942 --> 00:47:12.942
- Are you kidding me.
- Lauren plays the drums.


923
00:47:13.067 --> 00:47:13.900
Right, Shawn?

924
00:47:14.025 --> 00:47:15.025

with a little rhythm, you know.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.817
Just a little nauseous.

934
00:47:43.942 --> 00:47:45.459
Well, they said
the anesthesia will be out


935
00:47:45.483 --> 00:47:46.858
of your system by tomorrow.

936

Come on, show me what you got.

937
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.358
[Shawn groaning]

938
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.067
[groaning]

939
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.775
You got it. You got it.
That's good, good, good, good.


940
00:48:02.858 --> 00:48:05.442
[Shawn breathing heavily]

941
00:48:09.775 --> 00:48:11.025
Happy?

942
00:48:11.108 --> 00:48:12.733
- Happy?
- Yes.


943
00:48:12.858 --> 00:48:14.775
Now take another step.
You're doing great.


944
00:48:20.983 --> 00:48:23.025
[knocking on door]

945
00:48:24.108 --> 00:48:25.358
- Hey.
- Hey.


946
00:48:25.442 --> 00:48:27.108
Um, my mom said
Shawn's going back today,


947
00:48:27.192 --> 00:48:30.150
but, uh, he never texted
me back about the ride sitch.


948
00:48:30.275 --> 00:48:32.400
Oh, I think he thought
you had band.


949
00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:34.817
Hey, mom, have you seen
my wallet?


950
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.525
It's literally
right in front of you.


951
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.400
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one with eyeballs.


952
00:48:39.567 --> 00:48:41.817
Um, since you're here, do you
mind driving both of you?


953
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.650
Sure. Yeah.

954
00:48:44.733 --> 00:48:46.483
[keys clinking]

955
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.650
Thanks.

956
00:48:52.775 --> 00:48:53.817
[Shawn groans]

957
00:48:58.442 --> 00:48:59.900
How'd the surgery go?

958
00:49:00.983 --> 00:49:02.317
It was good.

959
00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.150
Sorry I didn't text you back.

960
00:49:06.233 --> 00:49:08.067
My knee is extra stiff
in the morning,


961
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.400
I just... I didn't wanna
hold you up.


962
00:49:10.567 --> 00:49:13.317
Okay, no sweat. Um...

963
00:49:13.442 --> 00:49:15.692
I don't want things
to be weird between us.


964
00:49:15.775 --> 00:49:17.233
Me neither.

965
00:49:17.317 --> 00:49:18.876
Yeah, but you've kind of
been avoiding me since


966
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.567
the whole porch incident.
So do you wanna talk about it?


967
00:49:26.483 --> 00:49:27.942
What's there to say?

968
00:49:28.108 --> 00:49:29.959
I don't know. That it was
like, a misunderstanding.


969
00:49:29.983 --> 00:49:32.858
That you're sorry and
we'll get over it.


970
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.317
You turned me down.

971
00:49:36.442 --> 00:49:38.358
- Are you blaming me?
- No, I'm just saying...


972
00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:40.067
I was the one who
put myself out there.


973
00:49:40.108 --> 00:49:42.228
And I was the one who was
completely thrown off guard.


974
00:49:42.275 --> 00:49:43.483
Well, whose fault was that?

975
00:49:45.275 --> 00:49:48.400
- You were giving vibes.
- No, I was not.


976
00:49:48.525 --> 00:49:50.525
Shawn, you're like
my best friend.


977
00:49:59.192 --> 00:50:00.692
We'll get over this, right?

978
00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:03.942
Right?

979
00:50:06.275 --> 00:50:07.442
Shawn?

980
00:50:11.567 --> 00:50:13.358
[keys clinking]

981
00:50:14.775 --> 00:50:15.983
[sighs]

982
00:50:22.108 --> 00:50:24.233
[all chattering]

983
00:50:24.275 --> 00:50:25.650
[whistle trilling]

984
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:34.483
[man 1] All right, let's go!

985
00:50:36.608 --> 00:50:39.067
[band girl 1] So sore, right?
[band girl 2] I don't mind.


986
00:50:39.192 --> 00:50:40.900
- Yeah.
- [man 1] Come on. Come on.


987
00:50:40.983 --> 00:50:43.233
- You know, just because...
- It wasn't right.


988
00:50:43.317 --> 00:50:44.400
Yeah.

989
00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:46.442
Dude, look.

990
00:50:46.525 --> 00:50:48.733
[laughter]

991
00:50:48.817 --> 00:50:49.942
Dude, it's her.

992
00:50:54.442 --> 00:50:55.608
What's goin' on?

993
00:50:56.692 --> 00:50:58.317
What are you guys looking at?

994
00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.483
Nothing.

995
00:51:00.108 --> 00:51:01.317
Yeah, I know...

996
00:51:01.442 --> 00:51:03.567
- Why are you watching me?
- We're not.


997
00:51:03.733 --> 00:51:06.400
- [Lauren chuckles]
- Seriously, it's nothing.


998
00:51:06.483 --> 00:51:08.442
[Lauren laughs]
Come on, tell me.


999
00:51:09.275 --> 00:51:11.483
We-we're just fans.

1000
00:51:12.483 --> 00:51:15.067
[Lauren] Of my drumming?

1001
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:16.483
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1002
00:51:16.608 --> 00:51:18.858
- [guys laughing]
- Okay, what's going on?


1003
00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.692
[Simon] I told you,
it's nothing.


1004
00:51:21.817 --> 00:51:22.817
Hey, don't.

1005
00:51:24.942 --> 00:51:26.192
Oh, my God.

1006
00:51:27.942 --> 00:51:28.942
[gasps]

1007
00:51:29.025 --> 00:51:30.317
[indistinct chattering]

1008
00:51:30.442 --> 00:51:32.858
[band girl 1] It's so gross.

1009
00:51:32.983 --> 00:51:34.067
Run, run, run.

1010
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:35.858
- Girls!
- Fight!


1011
00:51:35.942 --> 00:51:37.400
Hey, what's up?

1012
00:51:37.567 --> 00:51:38.733
[Shawn sighs]

1013
00:51:41.608 --> 00:51:42.942
[Lauren] God!

1014
00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:45.442
[indistinct chattering]

1015
00:51:45.567 --> 00:51:47.025
[Lauren] I have no idea.

1016
00:51:47.108 --> 00:51:48.418
I don't, I don't,
I don't know anything.


1017
00:51:48.442 --> 00:51:50.483
- How dare they?
- Are you serious?


1018
00:51:51.483 --> 00:51:53.358
What's all the racket, Shawn?

1019
00:51:53.442 --> 00:51:55.817
[all clamoring]

1020
00:51:56.817 --> 00:51:58.525
I think they know about HNTD.

1021
00:52:01.733 --> 00:52:03.275
This is disgusting.

1022
00:52:03.358 --> 00:52:06.025
[indistinct chatter]

1023
00:52:13.442 --> 00:52:15.066
I know, Car. It's-it's beyond...

1024
00:52:15.067 --> 00:52:16.067
[door opens]

1025
00:52:16.817 --> 00:52:19.650
Yes, of course.
Whatever you and Lauren need.


1026
00:52:19.733 --> 00:52:21.418
Every step of the way
Shawn and I are there.


1027
00:52:21.442 --> 00:52:23.192
[Cara] Great.
Could you find me someone?


1028
00:52:23.275 --> 00:52:24.650
If anything somebody else, that

1029
00:52:24.733 --> 00:52:26.567
we can maybe contact,
if you know anybody...


1030
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:28.334
I have a friend on the force,
I could give him a call.


1031
00:52:28.358 --> 00:52:30.483
[Cara] That's great.

1032
00:52:30.608 --> 00:52:31.775
[Lucinda] Mm-hmm.

1033
00:52:31.942 --> 00:52:33.608
[Cara] I don't know what to do.

1034
00:52:33.692 --> 00:52:35.358
Yeah. Be there soon.

1035
00:52:35.442 --> 00:52:37.192
- [sighs]
- What, was that Cara?


1036
00:52:37.275 --> 00:52:38.275
What-what'd she say?

1037
00:52:38.317 --> 00:52:39.397
We're going over to install

1038
00:52:39.442 --> 00:52:41.192
security cameras
outside the house.


1039
00:52:41.317 --> 00:52:42.876
- [Shawn] Why cameras?
- They think the creep who took


1040
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.358
those photos did it from outside
Lauren's window.


1041
00:52:45.442 --> 00:52:47.150
I hate that they feel unsafe.

1042
00:52:47.233 --> 00:52:48.608
Yeah, me too.

1043
00:52:52.192 --> 00:52:53.858
Did you know about this site?

1044
00:52:53.942 --> 00:52:54.942
No.

1045
00:52:55.067 --> 00:52:56.650
Well, apparently some
of your team did


1046
00:52:56.775 --> 00:52:59.015
and I don't want you hanging out
with those boys anymore.


1047
00:52:59.233 --> 00:53:00.275
Okay.

1048
00:53:01.275 --> 00:53:02.900
[relief sighs]

1049
00:53:02.983 --> 00:53:05.275
I thought that was gonna be
more of a fight. Thank you.


1050
00:53:06.275 --> 00:53:07.275
Thank you.

1051
00:53:10.692 --> 00:53:14.567
When I find out who did this,
I'm gonna totally lose it.


1052
00:53:17.942 --> 00:53:19.608
Let's go be security guards.

1053
00:53:20.567 --> 00:53:21.817
[sighs]

1054
00:53:24.275 --> 00:53:26.317
[Coach Briggs] I know this
is a big game today


1055
00:53:26.442 --> 00:53:29.108
and we wanna give
West Durham their due.


1056
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.817
But since recent events
have come to light...


1057
00:53:33.942 --> 00:53:35.233
[smacks lips]

1058
00:53:35.317 --> 00:53:37.692
I've taken pause.

1059
00:53:37.775 --> 00:53:40.775
This team and this program
has always had integrity.


1060
00:53:42.733 --> 00:53:44.400
Violence like this...

1061
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:46.817
it goes against
the whole community.


1062
00:53:46.942 --> 00:53:49.733
And so, out of respect for
the young women affected...


1063
00:53:51.775 --> 00:53:54.567
we've decided that the starters
are gonna sit this one out.


1064
00:53:54.733 --> 00:53:56.233
- What?!
- [player 1] That's not fair.


1065
00:53:56.358 --> 00:53:57.626
[player 2] Come on, man,
that's not fair. Like how...


1066
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:59.900
It's done!

1067
00:53:59.942 --> 00:54:02.567
[Coach Briggs] And it is
the least we can do.


1068
00:54:02.775 --> 00:54:05.525
The least we can do.

1069
00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:08.067
Until the information
we have is clear.


1070
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.150
Coach, please.

1071
00:54:11.275 --> 00:54:12.941
Scouts are coming today.

1072
00:54:12.942 --> 00:54:15.858
It's been a disappointing day
for all of us.


1073
00:54:17.108 --> 00:54:18.608
That's not fair.

1074
00:54:20.358 --> 00:54:21.733
[player 1] This sucks, man.

1075
00:54:23.567 --> 00:54:24.918
[Coach Briggs]
Second stringers, you're up.


1076
00:54:24.942 --> 00:54:26.275
Dammit!

1077
00:54:27.567 --> 00:54:29.567
My old man, he's gonna kill me.

1078
00:54:29.608 --> 00:54:32.567
- [player] Mine too.
- It'll be okay, man.


1079
00:54:32.608 --> 00:54:35.400
Maybe for you, Mason.
Not for me!


1080
00:54:35.525 --> 00:54:38.775
[Woodley] If this messes up my
college plans, my life is over!


1081
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:43.192
[thuds]

1082
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.650
[door opens]

1083
00:54:49.317 --> 00:54:50.317
[door slams shut]

1084
00:54:54.442 --> 00:54:55.442
[door closes]

1085
00:54:55.608 --> 00:54:57.858
[Cara] Hey, honey, we're back.

1086
00:55:00.817 --> 00:55:02.108
[Cara sighs]

1087
00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:04.858
What did they say?

1088
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.192
They suspended the boy who
showed you the site.


1089
00:55:10.275 --> 00:55:12.733
He didn't exactly show me.
I caught him.


1090
00:55:12.858 --> 00:55:15.233
- What else?
- Um...


1091
00:55:15.317 --> 00:55:20.233
They, uh, adjusted, the players
for their last football game...


1092
00:55:20.358 --> 00:55:23.025
And there's talk of pulling
the team from the playoffs.


1093
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.900
Okay. And?

1094
00:55:27.025 --> 00:55:28.275
[Cara] And that's it for now.

1095
00:55:29.942 --> 00:55:30.608
What?!

1096
00:55:30.775 --> 00:55:32.067
We know this is unacceptable,

1097
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:33.418
and we are livid
with your princi...


1098
00:55:33.442 --> 00:55:34.900
No one is really being punished?

1099
00:55:34.942 --> 00:55:37.025
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- Why aren't they doing anything?


1100
00:55:37.108 --> 00:55:39.108
Apparently there are other
schools involved,


1101
00:55:39.192 --> 00:55:41.483
but because the photos
weren't taken on school...


1102
00:55:41.567 --> 00:55:44.817
- That shouldn't matter, mom!
- I know, I know, I know.


1103
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.025
And I promise this is not
the end of it.


1104
00:55:47.192 --> 00:55:48.567
I've called the police,
and we will


1105
00:55:48.608 --> 00:55:49.876
make sure that there's an
investigation...


1106
00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.525
No, but, mom, it's school that
matters!


1107
00:55:51.608 --> 00:55:53.192
This is not okay, okay?

1108
00:55:53.275 --> 00:55:55.567
They're just leaving us girls
to deal with it while


1109
00:55:55.733 --> 00:55:57.233
Woodley Jones
goes to gym class?!


1110
00:55:57.275 --> 00:55:59.751
- Is that who you think did this?
- Of course that's who did this!


1111
00:55:59.775 --> 00:56:01.733
Him and all his crew
were swarming


1112
00:56:01.817 --> 00:56:03.317
the band girls
for the last two weeks.


1113
00:56:03.442 --> 00:56:05.608
It doesn't take a detective to
figure that out!


1114
00:56:05.692 --> 00:56:07.733
We told the school!
We told them!


1115
00:56:07.858 --> 00:56:10.025
- I know, I know, I know.
- [Lauren sobbing]


1116
00:56:10.108 --> 00:56:11.608
[Cara] It's not fair. I know.

1117
00:56:11.775 --> 00:56:14.233
It's so, so incredibly not fair.

1118
00:56:14.275 --> 00:56:16.317
[Lauren sobbing]

1119
00:56:17.942 --> 00:56:20.692
Did Shawn say anything about
his team mates?


1120
00:56:20.817 --> 00:56:22.817
Anything that could help us
with the investigation?


1121
00:56:22.858 --> 00:56:24.584
Not really. Just that
he didn't know about the site.


1122
00:56:24.608 --> 00:56:25.834
I'll ask him again then, though.

1123
00:56:25.858 --> 00:56:27.067
[Lauren sniffles]

1124
00:56:27.192 --> 00:56:28.192
I'm sorry.

1125
00:56:31.025 --> 00:56:32.400
[Lauren] It's not fair.

1126
00:56:40.233 --> 00:56:41.275
[phone buzz]

1127
00:56:51.483 --> 00:56:52.817
[door squeaks open]

1128
00:57:00.525 --> 00:57:01.942
[mouse clicks]

1129
00:57:02.067 --> 00:57:03.067
Ugh.

1130
00:57:04.067 --> 00:57:05.067
[sighs]

1131
00:57:07.942 --> 00:57:09.483
[mouse clicks]

1132
00:57:09.567 --> 00:57:11.400
[gasps] Oh, no. No.

1133
00:57:15.983 --> 00:57:18.442
[keyboard keys clicking]

1134
00:57:21.275 --> 00:57:22.400
[sighs]

1135
00:57:30.442 --> 00:57:32.150
[Lucinda] Come on.

1136
00:57:32.275 --> 00:57:33.275
[clicks lips]

1137
00:57:45.567 --> 00:57:47.108
Oh, my God.

1138
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.358
[sighs]

1139
00:58:24.775 --> 00:58:27.483
[mixer whirring]

1140
00:58:31.858 --> 00:58:33.858
Hey, can I, can I steal
a little of that?


1141
00:58:35.108 --> 00:58:36.108
Yeah.

1142
00:58:36.608 --> 00:58:37.650
[Shawn] Thanks.

1143
00:58:39.233 --> 00:58:41.482
I didn't know you had
a shift last night.


1144
00:58:41.483 --> 00:58:44.233
I didn't.
I just went to bed early.


1145
00:58:44.275 --> 00:58:45.275
Oh.

1146
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:53.442
Hey, can I take the car today?

1147
00:58:53.525 --> 00:58:55.165
I wanna drive in with
Lauren and make sure


1148
00:58:55.192 --> 00:58:56.483
she gets set up okay.

1149
00:58:58.442 --> 00:59:00.942
[water running]

1150
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.067
Mom.

1151
00:59:04.192 --> 00:59:05.900
Yeah. Take the car. Um...

1152
00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:08.067
Come straight home
tonight, okay?


1153
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.525
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, okay, sure.


1154
00:59:12.108 --> 00:59:14.567
[water running]

1155
00:59:28.025 --> 00:59:29.067
[water stops]

1156
00:59:49.442 --> 00:59:50.483
[car door closes]

1157
00:59:56.442 --> 00:59:57.608
It'll be okay.

1158
00:59:59.733 --> 01:00:02.150
You know, they say this
kinda thing builds character.


1159
01:00:04.358 --> 01:00:07.108
Guys like that don't believe
girls have character.


1160
01:00:07.233 --> 01:00:08.918
Since when do you care about
guys like that?


1161
01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:11.483
I don't. I just feel
really uncomfortable.


1162
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:20.232
Look, you are so much better...

1163
01:00:20.233 --> 01:00:22.942
than any jerk who looked
at that site, trust me.


1164
01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:26.192
You out shine them in every way.

1165
01:00:26.275 --> 01:00:30.233
And one day in the future,
this will all be behind us.


1166
01:00:40.608 --> 01:00:41.775
It'll be okay.

1167
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.483
You got this.

1168
01:00:51.192 --> 01:00:54.150
[sighs deeply]

1169
01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:57.733
[school bell ringing]

1170
01:01:04.442 --> 01:01:05.442
Shawn?

1171
01:01:06.775 --> 01:01:09.233
Hey. How's Lauren doing?

1172
01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:12.692
Uh...

1173
01:01:14.858 --> 01:01:16.900
She's upset.

1174
01:01:16.983 --> 01:01:19.233
But she's here.

1175
01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:21.376
It's pretty messed up you
let that happen to your friend.


1176
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.025
- What do you mean? I...
- Cut the crap.


1177
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.030
I know you posted
that photo of me on that site.


1178
01:01:26.108 --> 01:01:29.150
You think I wouldn't
recognize the photo? I took it.


1179
01:01:29.275 --> 01:01:30.915
Look, you lost your virginity
to me, and...


1180
01:01:30.942 --> 01:01:32.983
- That was...
- Shut up!


1181
01:01:33.067 --> 01:01:35.400
You lost your virginity to me
and not that there's anything


1182
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.925
wrong with that, but I respected
your privacy and I didn't go


1183
01:01:38.067 --> 01:01:39.567
blabbing it to anybody else.

1184
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:44.317
Okay, uh...
Yeah, that's, that's true.


1185
01:01:44.442 --> 01:01:49.233
Look, I'm sorry if you're salty
because we ended or whatever,


1186
01:01:49.358 --> 01:01:52.025
but this was a pretty spiteful
revenge.


1187
01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.733
I didn't think you
were that pathetic.


1188
01:01:55.275 --> 01:01:58.150
You didn't tell anyone
it was me, did you?


1189
01:01:58.317 --> 01:02:00.358
Wow. [laughs] Wow!

1190
01:02:00.442 --> 01:02:02.692
That's the first thing
that pops into your brain?


1191
01:02:02.775 --> 01:02:05.233
Oh, my God. I thought at
the very least you'd apologize.


1192
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.084
You know what,
you really should tell Lauren.


1193
01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:09.317
- Hey, don't...
- Don't touch me!


1194
01:02:10.608 --> 01:02:11.608
You're gross.

1195
01:02:23.275 --> 01:02:24.317
[knocking on door]

1196
01:02:30.817 --> 01:02:32.692
- Hi.
- Hey. Can we talk?


1197
01:02:32.775 --> 01:02:34.209
- I need to tell you something.
- You know...


1198
01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:36.024
The detective just got here,
actually.


1199
01:02:36.025 --> 01:02:37.567
- Oh.
- In fact, I'd appreciate


1200
01:02:37.733 --> 01:02:39.567
a second set of ears
if you got the time.


1201
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:42.525
The stress of it all, just my
attention's going in and out.


1202
01:02:42.608 --> 01:02:43.983
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- Yeah.


1203
01:02:44.067 --> 01:02:45.608
- Happy to help.
- Okay, I'm just...


1204
01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.543
[Detective Zeke] The good news
is we set up a tip line


1205
01:02:49.567 --> 01:02:52.650
for more information, but in
terms of the explicit photos,


1206
01:02:52.733 --> 01:02:54.900
we can't remove 'em
from the site.


1207
01:02:55.067 --> 01:02:56.567
I don't understand.

1208
01:02:56.733 --> 01:02:58.168
[Zeke] The server
holding these pictures


1209
01:02:58.192 --> 01:02:59.817
are offshore,
so although the images


1210
01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.400
were taken here, we're not in

1211
01:03:01.525 --> 01:03:02.858
the jurisdiction to remove 'em.

1212
01:03:03.858 --> 01:03:05.317
That's so stupid.

1213
01:03:05.442 --> 01:03:06.400
[Zeke] Welcome to the law.

1214
01:03:06.442 --> 01:03:07.900
It's frustrating, I know.

1215
01:03:07.942 --> 01:03:09.334
[Lucinda] I saw cops out
surveying the neighborhood.


1216
01:03:09.358 --> 01:03:11.483
- Anything there?
- [Zeke] Not much.


1217
01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:13.251
[Zeke] You must live in a
pretty trusting community


1218
01:03:13.275 --> 01:03:15.233
because very few people
have cameras.


1219
01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.317
And the footage we did get
led us nowhere.


1220
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.233
[Zeke] Just
dog walkers and cars.


1221
01:03:21.108 --> 01:03:22.628
Well, what about the users
on the site?


1222
01:03:22.692 --> 01:03:24.567
[Cara] Can't you
at least arrest them?


1223
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:28.150
[Zeke] Individual users
know to employ IP blockers.


1224
01:03:28.275 --> 01:03:30.233
The one thing I can tell you
is that the site


1225
01:03:30.358 --> 01:03:32.733
had widespread viewing,
especially locally.


1226
01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.442
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

1227
01:03:34.608 --> 01:03:36.567
I don't know how you
feel about silver linings,


1228
01:03:36.692 --> 01:03:39.942
but the site's gain in
popularity is what exposed it.


1229
01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:42.150
You tell that to
my traumatized daughter.


1230
01:03:42.233 --> 01:03:44.942
[Cara] She is afraid to shower.

1231
01:03:45.025 --> 01:03:46.567
[Zeke] I'm sorry
we can't do more.


1232
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:50.192
Can you at least do something
then, about the online chatter?


1233
01:03:51.942 --> 01:03:53.062
[Zeke] What's the situation?

1234
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.192
Mostly anonymous posts blaming,

1235
01:03:55.275 --> 01:03:57.233
telling these girls
that it's their fault.


1236
01:03:57.317 --> 01:03:58.650
Then we have the sympathizers,

1237
01:03:58.733 --> 01:04:00.317
commiserating
with the football team.


1238
01:04:00.442 --> 01:04:02.084
[Zeke] Well, you could bring
Lauren in to file


1239
01:04:02.108 --> 01:04:04.150
an online harassment report.

1240
01:04:04.233 --> 01:04:06.317
But it's hard to lay charges,

1241
01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:09.275
especially when the posts
are anonymous.


1242
01:04:09.442 --> 01:04:12.358
So we're just living
in the court of public opinion?


1243
01:04:12.442 --> 01:04:14.900
It's awful, I know.
It's an epidemic of...


1244
01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:17.150
So you can't do anything else?

1245
01:04:17.275 --> 01:04:19.442
[Zeke] Not unless
we get the actual phone


1246
01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:21.733
or a computer with the photos.

1247
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.400
But if you got those or found
out who took them, then what?


1248
01:04:25.525 --> 01:04:28.233
Then the culprit would be
charged with voyeurism,


1249
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.067
as well as possession
and distribution


1250
01:04:30.108 --> 01:04:31.775
of child pornography.

1251
01:04:32.817 --> 01:04:34.150
Child pornography?

1252
01:04:34.275 --> 01:04:36.107
Yeah, and depending
on the trial,


1253
01:04:36.108 --> 01:04:37.817
they'll likely do time.

1254
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.317
This kind of charge carries
a stigma.


1255
01:04:40.442 --> 01:04:42.483
[Zeke] It'll stay
on their record for life.


1256
01:04:53.983 --> 01:04:56.900
[indistinct chatter]

1257
01:05:08.775 --> 01:05:10.400
Leave room for me
in that shower tonight.


1258
01:05:10.483 --> 01:05:12.567
I'll make sure
to save it next time.


1259
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:13.817
Screw you!

1260
01:05:13.942 --> 01:05:16.400
[all laughing]

1261
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.192
[boy 1] Look at her.

1262
01:05:22.275 --> 01:05:24.025
Hey, looking good, Lauren.

1263
01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:26.858
Watch it, slut.

1264
01:05:26.942 --> 01:05:29.400
[distorted laughing]

1265
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.567
Hey! Hey! Back off, vultures.

1266
01:05:33.733 --> 01:05:35.525
[Lauren sobbing]

1267
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:36.942
It's okay.

1268
01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:49.442
- [door closes]
- [Shawn] Hey, mom, I'm home.


1269
01:05:51.692 --> 01:05:52.692
Mom?

1270
01:05:55.775 --> 01:05:57.775
Mom?

1271
01:05:57.942 --> 01:05:59.334
Mom, what are you doing
with my hard drive?


1272
01:05:59.358 --> 01:06:01.233
- I know what you did.
- I-I-I can explain it.


1273
01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:03.150
- I doubt it.
- I was trying to protect her.


1274
01:06:03.275 --> 01:06:05.192
I'm sorry,
I-is that your defense?


1275
01:06:05.275 --> 01:06:06.983
I-I-if I, if I didn't do it,
t-t-they, they


1276
01:06:07.108 --> 01:06:09.084
would have taken the photos
in a worse way, I mean,


1277
01:06:09.108 --> 01:06:11.233
you don't understand these guys,

1278
01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:14.650
they're, they're,
they're, they're... I was.


1279
01:06:14.733 --> 01:06:17.067
- I was trying to help.
- Shawn, that is delusional.


1280
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:18.942
- [Shawn] But...
- It's delusional!


1281
01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:20.567
I know. I know. I just...

1282
01:06:20.733 --> 01:06:22.418
[Lucinda] Do you realize if the
police catch you with this,


1283
01:06:22.442 --> 01:06:25.525
you will serve time for
child pornography.


1284
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:27.358
- What? No, I...
- And you thought your knee


1285
01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:29.067
was gonna jeopardize
your future.


1286
01:06:29.108 --> 01:06:32.108
[Lucinda] Oh, Shawn, you
will have a criminal record!


1287
01:06:32.275 --> 01:06:33.501
Your life will never
be the same!


1288
01:06:33.525 --> 01:06:35.400
Oh, God, Oh, my God,
I'm so stupid.


1289
01:06:35.483 --> 01:06:37.400
- I'm so stupid!
- [Lucinda] Stop it!


1290
01:06:38.942 --> 01:06:40.900
Okay, I can't feel
sorry for you right now.


1291
01:06:40.983 --> 01:06:44.066
[Shawn] Oh, mom.
I-I-I can't, mom. I...


1292
01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:46.358
[breathing heavily]

1293
01:06:46.483 --> 01:06:49.442
Mom, mom, please,
l-listen to me, mom.


1294
01:06:49.567 --> 01:06:51.108
We have to destroy this.

1295
01:06:51.233 --> 01:06:53.400
[laughs] I don't know.

1296
01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:56.025
I mean, this is just as bad.

1297
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:58.350
[Shawn] But th-there are
no other options. What, what...


1298
01:06:58.442 --> 01:07:01.108
Please, mom,
I'm really scared right now.


1299
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:04.358
[sighs]

1300
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.150
Please.

1301
01:07:34.525 --> 01:07:36.192
[knocking on door]

1302
01:07:38.108 --> 01:07:39.483
[Cara] Coming.

1303
01:07:43.608 --> 01:07:47.108
Hey, um, does Lauren
need a ride to school today?


1304
01:07:47.275 --> 01:07:48.733
She wasn't answering my texts.

1305
01:07:48.858 --> 01:07:51.358
Oh, sweetie, I don't think
she's going in today.


1306
01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:54.567
- Uh, is she okay?
- She's upset.


1307
01:07:54.692 --> 01:07:56.942
School's doing nothing.
The cops aren't either.


1308
01:07:57.067 --> 01:07:59.387
No one really has any answers,
and everything, it's just...


1309
01:08:00.192 --> 01:08:01.567
out of our control.

1310
01:08:03.067 --> 01:08:05.025
No one will remember this.

1311
01:08:05.108 --> 01:08:07.192
Lauren will.

1312
01:08:07.275 --> 01:08:10.067
Thanks for stopping by.
I'll tell her that you did.


1313
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.192
- Okay.
- Okay.


1314
01:08:12.942 --> 01:08:14.108
[door closes]

1315

[indistinct chatter]

1316
01:08:23.275 --> 01:08:24.733
You got it.

1317
01:08:26.275 --> 01:08:27.555
- All right.
- [man 1] Come on now.


1318
01:08:31.442 --> 01:08:33.150
Hey, Martins, man,
your phone busted...


1319
01:08:33.233 --> 01:08:36.108
- Piss off, man!
- Hey, don't come for me, pal.


1320
01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:38.608
This is on you. Huh?

1321
01:08:38.775 --> 01:08:41.066
You can't even keep
your whore in line.


1322
01:08:41.067 --> 01:08:43.733
- I said, piss off!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


1323
01:08:43.858 --> 01:08:45.817
Don't talk to me ever again.

1324
01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:58.358
You know you're nothing,
Martins.


1325
01:08:58.442 --> 01:09:00.650
You're done. You hear me?
You're nothing!


1326
01:09:00.733 --> 01:09:03.317
You know what, he's right.
You are nothing.


1327
01:09:03.442 --> 01:09:05.650
In fact, you're all scum.

1328
01:09:07.025 --> 01:09:08.567
Yo. Who's that?

1329
01:09:12.317 --> 01:09:14.067
- All right.
- I know where you are.


1330
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.418
- I got you.
- [woman 1] You always say that.


1331
01:09:15.442 --> 01:09:17.275
I will win this time.

1332
01:09:17.358 --> 01:09:18.817
I think you cheat.

Please respond to

1335
01:09:22.775 --> 01:09:24.567
[Lucinda] Let's go.
Move! Move! Move!


1336
01:09:24.733 --> 01:09:25.834
[announcer] Please
provide updates


1337
01:09:25.858 --> 01:09:27.108
on your ETA and status upon...

[Lucinda] What is it?

1344
01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:48.900
[Cara] Thank God it's you.

1345
01:09:49.025 --> 01:09:50.567
She-she's in
the upstairs bathroom.


1346
01:09:50.608 --> 01:09:52.128
- What's going on?
- She's not answering.


1347
01:09:52.233 --> 01:09:53.567
She won't answer.

1348
01:09:55.067 --> 01:09:56.358
Go.

1349
01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.067
Lauren. Lauren. Step back.

1350
01:09:59.192 --> 01:10:01.900
Lauren, if you're near
the door, move away.

[crying] Lauren.

1354
01:10:10.192 --> 01:10:12.900
Look for the pill bottle.
We need to know what she took.


1355
01:10:12.983 --> 01:10:16.442
[Lucinda] Step. Step. Step.

1356
01:10:16.608 --> 01:10:17.775
Last step.

1357
01:10:17.858 --> 01:10:20.567
[indistinct chatter]

[grunting]

1359
01:10:24.608 --> 01:10:26.317
- [Cara] It's okay, baby.
- Come on.


1360
01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:28.983
Mom? Mom?

1361
01:10:29.108 --> 01:10:31.692
- Go home and wait for me there.
- [Cara] Luce, where do I go?


1362
01:10:31.817 --> 01:10:33.668
[Lucinda] Get in the front.
I'm gonna get in the back.


1363
01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:34.692
[Cara] All right.

1364

[tapping]

[door opens]

1366
01:11:01.233 --> 01:11:02.817
Is she gonna be okay?

1367
01:11:06.442 --> 01:11:09.275
She's in stable condition.
They pumped her stomach.


1368
01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.150
[sighs]

1369
01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:17.900
- This is all my fault.
- Yeah, it is.


1370
01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:21.001
[Lucinda] You know, you're
supposed to play football


1371
01:11:21.025 --> 01:11:25.650
for discipline, teamwork,
love of the game.


1372
01:11:26.692 --> 01:11:28.650
[chuckles] Not to hurt people.

1373
01:11:32.275 --> 01:11:33.858
- I know.
- [softly] Yeah.


1374
01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:38.942
You know, I tried to model
strength and integrity.


1375
01:11:39.025 --> 01:11:40.817
[Lucinda] I know I'm
not perfect, but I tried


1376
01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.858
to give you
what your dad couldn't.


1377
01:11:45.692 --> 01:11:48.858
I just, I wanted you to
grow up to be a good man.


1378
01:11:59.775 --> 01:12:01.275
Am I a bad mom?

1379
01:12:03.108 --> 01:12:04.108
What?

1380
01:12:06.233 --> 01:12:07.275
Am I?

1381
01:12:08.442 --> 01:12:09.983
This isn't on you.

1382
01:12:10.067 --> 01:12:12.400
[Lucinda] 'Cause you must
have known this was wrong.


1383
01:12:14.983 --> 01:12:16.775
[inhales] Yeah, but...

1384
01:12:19.608 --> 01:12:21.692
[tearing up]
People liked me more.


1385
01:12:21.817 --> 01:12:24.067
Yeah? What people?

1386
01:12:24.108 --> 01:12:26.775
Those monsters you call friends?

1387
01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.775
Lauren is your friend.

1388
01:12:28.858 --> 01:12:30.858
She has been there for you
through everything,


1389
01:12:30.983 --> 01:12:33.358
and you betray her for them?

1390
01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:37.650
[laughs] Those photos...

1391
01:12:37.775 --> 01:12:40.858
What kind of a person does that?

1392
01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:46.150
[scoffs]

1393
01:12:48.442 --> 01:12:50.067
- I wanna go to the police.
- No!


1394
01:12:50.108 --> 01:12:52.067
- [Lucinda] Absolutely not!
- So, so, so, so, what?


1395
01:12:52.233 --> 01:12:53.584
We're just supposed to pretend
like everything's fine?


1396
01:12:53.608 --> 01:12:55.233
No, none of this is fine!

1397
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.543
You think I would have dumped
that stuff if I thought there


1398
01:12:57.567 --> 01:12:59.858
was another way,
but here we are.


1399
01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:02.025
So don't make it worse.

1400
01:13:02.108 --> 01:13:04.650
So what do you want me to do?
What, what am I supposed to do?


1401
01:13:04.733 --> 01:13:05.817
Just stop.

1402
01:13:07.233 --> 01:13:09.168
[Lucinda] This isn't something
you could just fix.


1403
01:13:09.192 --> 01:13:11.483
This is a lot bigger than that.

1404
01:13:12.525 --> 01:13:14.400
[Shawn sighs]

1405
01:13:16.775 --> 01:13:18.983
[Lucinda] Look, we're tired.
Okay?


1406
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:21.858
This has been a very long,
very stressful day,


1407
01:13:21.983 --> 01:13:25.358
so we are gonna pause
on this conversation. Okay?


1408
01:13:29.192 --> 01:13:30.233
[softly] Okay.

1409
01:13:30.317 --> 01:13:31.858
[Lucinda] We'll talk
in the morning.


1410
01:13:31.942 --> 01:13:34.275
Promise me...

1411
01:13:34.358 --> 01:13:36.317
you will not do
anything until then.


1412
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:39.233
[Lucinda] Promise me, Shawn.

1413
01:13:42.442 --> 01:13:43.775
I promise.

1414
01:13:47.733 --> 01:13:48.775
Good.

1415
01:13:51.858 --> 01:13:53.400
Now get to bed.

1416
01:13:54.192 --> 01:13:55.525
[Shawn sniffles]

1417
01:13:55.608 --> 01:13:57.942
[Shawn breathing shakily]

1418
01:14:37.692 --> 01:14:39.358
[car engine starting]

1419
01:14:41.275 --> 01:14:42.275
Shawn?

1420
01:14:51.483 --> 01:14:52.525
Shawn.

1421
01:14:53.275 --> 01:14:54.275
Shawn.

1422
01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:56.525
No, Shawn.

1423
01:15:00.067 --> 01:15:03.358
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car! Shawn.


1424
01:15:03.442 --> 01:15:04.983
[slams] Dammit!

1425
01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.400
[Lucinda] Shawn!

1426
01:15:23.775 --> 01:15:24.858
Shawn!

1427
01:16:01.442 --> 01:16:03.900
[groaning]

1428
01:16:18.567 --> 01:16:19.650
Can I help you?

1429
01:16:22.192 --> 01:16:22.983
Yes.

1430
01:16:23.067 --> 01:16:24.400
- [Lucinda] Hey.
- Can I help you?


1431
01:16:24.567 --> 01:16:26.192
Has a boy been by
in the last 20 minutes?


1432
01:16:26.317 --> 01:16:27.525
Tall, 16.

1433
01:16:34.733 --> 01:16:37.067
[indistinct chatter in the back]

1434
01:16:39.442 --> 01:16:40.442
[phone buzz]

1435
01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:54.692
[grunting]

1436
01:17:17.983 --> 01:17:19.650
[office telephone ringing]

1437
01:17:23.942 --> 01:17:24.983
[door closes]

1438
01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.192
[Shawn] Hey.

1439
01:17:36.275 --> 01:17:37.775
Is it okay that I'm here?

1440
01:17:40.442 --> 01:17:41.483
Yeah.

1441
01:17:58.567 --> 01:18:00.108
How you feeling?

1442
01:18:02.733 --> 01:18:03.817
[weakly] Stupid.

1443
01:18:03.942 --> 01:18:05.025
[chuckles]

1444
01:18:05.608 --> 01:18:06.608
Don't.

1445
01:18:08.192 --> 01:18:09.567
It's not your fault.

1446
01:18:10.817 --> 01:18:12.317
None of this has been
your fault.


1447
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.108
Those pills didn't take
themselves, so...


1448
01:18:21.233 --> 01:18:23.775
Uh, hey, um...

1449
01:18:25.275 --> 01:18:27.317
- I wanted to say...
- No, you don't.


1450
01:18:27.442 --> 01:18:29.192
You don't have to say anything.

1451
01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:33.317
[softly] It's okay.

1452
01:18:34.275 --> 01:18:35.317
[Lauren sniffles]

1453
01:18:37.942 --> 01:18:39.358
[voice breaking]
Lauren, it was me.


1454
01:18:42.608 --> 01:18:43.733
What was you?

1455
01:18:46.983 --> 01:18:48.733
[tearing]
I took the photos of you.


1456
01:18:51.567 --> 01:18:52.733
I posted them.

1457
01:18:56.442 --> 01:18:59.733
It was so stupid. I
-I just...

1458
01:18:59.858 --> 01:19:01.108
[softly] No.

1459
01:19:02.942 --> 01:19:04.400
No.

1460
01:19:04.608 --> 01:19:07.983
I would... if there was a way
to take it back, I-I-I would.


1461
01:19:08.108 --> 01:19:10.900
[Shawn sobbing]
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.


1462
01:19:10.983 --> 01:19:13.692
[Lauren breathing heavily]

1463
01:19:22.567 --> 01:19:23.983
- Hey.
- Hey. What's wrong?


1464
01:19:24.108 --> 01:19:25.983
- Is, uh, Shawn here?
- Uh, I don't know.


1465
01:19:26.108 --> 01:19:27.775
He-he might be in with Lauren.

1466
01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.358
What-what's going on here?

1467
01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:45.150
I'm so sorry.

1468
01:19:52.108 --> 01:19:53.233
No.

1469
01:19:55.233 --> 01:19:56.275
[Cara] No.

1470
01:19:58.733 --> 01:19:59.900
It was you?

1471
01:20:07.567 --> 01:20:08.692
Did you know?

1472
01:20:10.108 --> 01:20:11.317
I, um...

1473
01:20:12.442 --> 01:20:14.233
Not at first, but then, yes.

1474
01:20:14.317 --> 01:20:16.567
[Lucinda] And-and I was
gonna tell you.


1475
01:20:16.692 --> 01:20:17.692
But, um...

1476
01:20:18.817 --> 01:20:20.900
I mean, the charges...

1477
01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.567
they would have changed his life
and I didn't want him


1478
01:20:23.692 --> 01:20:25.442
to get hurt too and I didn't
realize how bad


1479
01:20:25.525 --> 01:20:28.400
it was gonna get.
I am so, so sorry, Lauren.


1480
01:20:28.567 --> 01:20:31.275
- Don't talk to her.
- We're gonna figure this out.


1481
01:20:31.442 --> 01:20:34.483
- Get out!
- [Lucinda] Cara. Please...


1482
01:20:34.608 --> 01:20:37.567
You were there alongside me
at all those meetings,


1483
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:39.525
fighting to know who, who, who.

1484
01:20:41.108 --> 01:20:42.567
Meanwhile your kid
is the pervert.


1485
01:20:42.608 --> 01:20:44.067
I'll
-I'll
-I'll go to the police.

1486
01:20:44.192 --> 01:20:45.733
- I-I-I'll sign a confession.
- Shawn.


1487
01:20:45.817 --> 01:20:47.317
I-I just want this
to be right again.


1488
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.650
It's not good enough.

1489
01:20:48.733 --> 01:20:50.317
[sobbing]
Tell me what I can do.


1490
01:20:50.442 --> 01:20:52.608
I'll-I'll do anything
to make this better.


1491
01:20:52.733 --> 01:20:53.858
Why'd you do it?

1492
01:20:59.483 --> 01:21:02.400
I... I don't, I don't know.

1493
01:21:04.233 --> 01:21:06.942
[Shawn inhales] At first,
I-I-I thought I needed


1494
01:21:07.067 --> 01:21:10.983
to do it to be something,
or so I didn't lose something.


1495
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:15.942
It finally felt like I belonged
and everything just stopped.


1496
01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:22.692
I thought I needed to prove
myself, and I-I know that sounds


1497
01:21:22.817 --> 01:21:23.983
stupid now, but...

1498
01:21:25.525 --> 01:21:28.442
Lauren, you're my best friend.

1499
01:21:28.567 --> 01:21:32.983
And I messed this all up
and I'm just really sorry.


1500
01:21:37.358 --> 01:21:38.567
You should leave.

1501
01:21:40.233 --> 01:21:41.317
[Cara] Go!

1502
01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:45.942
[Shawn sniffles]

1503
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.942
[Lauren crying]

1504
01:22:00.358 --> 01:22:01.400
[Lauren] Wait.

1505
01:22:04.275 --> 01:22:05.858
- We won't go to the police.
- Lauren...


1506
01:22:05.942 --> 01:22:08.067
[Lauren] No!

1507
01:22:08.192 --> 01:22:10.608
I don't want anyone else's
life ruined.


1508
01:22:11.733 --> 01:22:12.733
Thank you.

1509
01:22:13.817 --> 01:22:15.025
[Lauren] Don't thank me.

1510
01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:17.942
This isn't for either of you.

1511
01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:20.442
[sighs]

1512
01:22:23.442 --> 01:22:24.817
We're not friends.

1513
01:22:33.733 --> 01:22:36.067
[Shawn sobbing]

1514
01:22:52.817 --> 01:22:55.400
[footsteps]

1515
01:23:02.858 --> 01:23:04.567
[birds chirping]

1516
01:23:06.233 --> 01:23:07.608
Looks like the knee's healing.

1517
01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:10.733
Yeah.

1518
01:23:10.858 --> 01:23:12.900
Little by little.

1519
01:23:12.983 --> 01:23:15.483
It should be good as new
by the, the summer.


1520
01:23:17.108 --> 01:23:18.483
- Good.
- So, um...


1521
01:23:19.525 --> 01:23:21.900
I was thinking, uh...

1522
01:23:21.942 --> 01:23:24.025
maybe I would try out
again next season.


1523
01:23:25.483 --> 01:23:27.567
I like you, Shawn.

1524
01:23:27.733 --> 01:23:30.108
But I'm very aware
of what went down this year.


1525
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.817
Yeah, I know.

1526
01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:35.542
The seniors didn't get
their scholarships


1527
01:23:35.608 --> 01:23:37.108
or their college picks.

1528
01:23:37.233 --> 01:23:39.733
There's repercussions
to our actions.


1529
01:23:39.858 --> 01:23:42.233
Woodley and the other seniors
on the team will be facing


1530
01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.025
very different choices now.

1531
01:23:45.567 --> 01:23:49.108
My aim is to build a,
a fresh team, a new culture.


1532
01:23:51.358 --> 01:23:53.483
Yeah, that's fair.

1533
01:23:53.608 --> 01:23:56.150
It's not that I don't think
you're a talented athlete...


1534
01:23:56.233 --> 01:23:59.400
it's just I wonder about
the time you need for yourself.


1535
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.067
Let's keep talking.

1536
01:24:07.192 --> 01:24:08.983
- Thanks, Coach.
- Yeah.


1537
01:24:15.275 --> 01:24:17.067
- Yeah.
- Okay, yeah, at 7:00.


1538
01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:21.150
[indistinct chatter]

1539
01:24:35.817 --> 01:24:38.650
Hey, uh, thanks for coming.

1540
01:24:38.775 --> 01:24:41.317
I assume you all know why we're
here, but just in case,


1541
01:24:41.442 --> 01:24:44.108
you're looking for the knitting
group, that is down the hall.


1542
01:24:44.233 --> 01:24:45.692
[all chuckles]

1543
01:24:45.817 --> 01:24:47.483
Um...

1544
01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.275
This is an advocacy group
to empower


1545
01:24:50.358 --> 01:24:52.525
parents and schools to do more

1546
01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:55.067
about online safety
and harassment.


1547
01:24:55.192 --> 01:24:57.942
I'm sure we'll create
an awful acronym for it.


1548
01:24:58.025 --> 01:24:59.525
But, uh...

1549
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.567
it's important stuff.

1550
01:25:01.608 --> 01:25:02.733
[door opens]

1551
01:25:02.858 --> 01:25:04.900
[footsteps]

1552
01:25:05.025 --> 01:25:07.483
- [clicks lips] Um...
- [door closes]


1553
01:25:07.608 --> 01:25:09.525
I came to this issue
from a personal place.


1554
01:25:09.608 --> 01:25:12.733
I've struggled
as a mother of a son, knowing


1555
01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:15.317
how to help him navigate
the influences out there,


1556
01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.733
many of which
are out of my control.


1557
01:25:19.983 --> 01:25:22.483
These choices our kids make
