1
00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:07.480
<i>You're lucky, you know.</i>

2
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:10.775
<i>I rarely allow anyone into my flat.</i>

3
00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:15.113
<i>I know...</i>

4
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.115
<i>Humble digs.</i>

5
00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:20.118
<i>Not exactly what you'd call
a "panty peeler."</i>


6
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.081
Do you know what I mean?

7
00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:28.585
But it suits me just fine.

8
00:01:29.628 --> 00:01:33.131
To be honest, I rarely spend a night
in my own bed anyway.


9
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:36.927
You see, here's my theory.

10
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.930
For most women,
if a guy's a good provider


11
00:01:40.013 --> 00:01:41.598
and generally a nice chap

12
00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:44.726
six-pack abs
really aren't a deal-breaker.


13
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.980
On the flip side, however,
even though the PC boyfriend


14
00:01:48.063 --> 00:01:49.440
sat next to you with his arm

15
00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:51.024
slung around your shoulder
will deny it...


16
00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:56.155
and he will deny it,
for us boys, it's all about "FBB."


17
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:03.162
Face. Boobs. Bum.

18
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.873
I'm just being honest.

19
00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:10.085
It's been said that clothes
speak the international language.


20
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.672
And I have to admit,
I'm a bit of a fashion whore.


21
00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:15.549
Unfortunately, today I've got work

22
00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.427
and I have to tone it down
a little bit, but that's all right.


23
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:21.597
Gucci. End-of-summer sale.
Very understated.


24
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.225
And I can easily spice it up with...

25
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.938
What? No.
I know what you're thinking.


26
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:31.357
If you ooze masculinity,
like some of us do


27
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.359
you have no reason to fear pink.

28
00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:34.610
Smashing.

29
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.990
Now, in the cologne department,
most men overdo it.


30
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.202
Americans practically spray it on
with a crop duster.


31
00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:47.832
My rule, nothing above the neck

32
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.376
though I do like a little splash
on "Big Ben."


33
00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:54.005
You never know
where the day may take you.


34
00:02:57.258 --> 00:02:58.384
Almost forgot.

35
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.346
New word for the day.

36
00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:05.266
<i>Ostentatious...</i>

37
00:03:05.642 --> 00:03:08.728
<i>The attempt to attract attention
to oneself.</i>


38
00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:12.190
Who? Me?

39
00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:17.779
Oh, blimey. I'm so rude.
I haven't introduced myself.


40
00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:18.947
- I'm...
- Alfie?


41
00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:22.367
There you go. Alfie.

42
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.164
Are you the little elf that left
these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?


43
00:03:28.248 --> 00:03:32.085
No... You must have a secret admirer,
Mrs. Schnitman.


44
00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:36.548
You are such a doll, Alfie.
But I'm supposed to be on a diet.


45
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:38.300
- On a diet?
- A diet.


46
00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:39.551
- You?
- Yeah.


47
00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:43.847
Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu,
but you should know by now


48
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.474
that a full-figured girl
like yourself


49
00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.768
- is every guy's secret fantasy.
- Stop it.


50
00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.563
So she's a tub of lard.
The ship's already sailed


51
00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:54.191
so why not make her feel good
about herself, right?


52
00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:56.026
- Lu?
- Yes, angel?


53
00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.361
I'm working the night spot
at the moment


54
00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:59.237
and my apartment is a horror show

55
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:02.282
so I'm sorry if I keep you up
with the dustbusting at 2am.


56
00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:04.826
Don't you worry.
I'll give it a quick straighten.


57
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.912
No... you don't need to that.

58
00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:10.541
Nonsense.
I like doing things for you, Alfie.


59
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:13.877
I'm a blessed man
having you in my life.


60
00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:18.841
- Thank you.
- Keys are in the usual spot.


61
00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:27.599
<i>Now, back home,
you're always hearing tales</i>


62
00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:29.435
<i>about some bloke
migrating to the States</i>


63
00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:31.729
<i>and winding up with buckets of money.</i>

64
00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:35.691
<i>So not long ago, I packed up
my bucket and headed west.</i>


65
00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:39.612
Now, I must admit,
I had a second motive.


66
00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.408
I'd always been told that the most
beautiful women in the world...


67
00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.995
resided in Manhattan.

68
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.289
And when it comes to shagging birds

69
00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.166
It's all about one thing...

70
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.837
Location...

71
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.673
<i>God, I love this city.</i>

72
00:04:58.756 --> 00:04:59.966
All right, girls.

73
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:01.884
<i>I mean, just look around.</i>

74
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:06.764
<i>I mean, every one of them
unique, special, like snowflakes.</i>


75
00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:11.936
And with such a plethora...

76
00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:16.023
Calendar word meaning "abundance,"
of gorgeousness and diversity


77
00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:20.028
well, how could a man ever choose
to settle down with just one?


78
00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:25.158
I myself subscribe more
to the European philosophy of life.


79
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.036
My priorities leaning
towards wine, women...


80
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.288
well, actually, that's about it.

81
00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.874
Wine and women.

82
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.880
Although, women and women
is always a fun option.


83
00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:47.097
So... to live life to the fullest

84
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:51.893
I require only enough
to cover my modest expenses.


85
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:56.231
I've no desire to be
the richest stiff in the cemetery.


86
00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.744
I think this might just be
my favorite position.


87
00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.581
I know it was President Kennedy's.

88
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.251
He was such a great leader.

89
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.254
Of course, JFK used
the old "bad back" excuse


90
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.380
but if you ask me

91
00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:24.092
he knew it gave you maximum pleasure
with minimum exertion.


92
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.511
What is it about
the back of a limo?

93
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.310
Obligatory cuddling.

94
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.773
Thousand one, thousand two...

95
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:42.820
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking.
I've got a ten o'clock pickup.


96
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.242
You better hurry up.
You don't want to keep her waiting.


97
00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:56.250
Quite the number, isn't she?

98
00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:02.840
Yet, she tells me her old man
hasn't shagged her in six months.


99
00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.134
Six months.

100
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.720
I mean, thank God
there are gentlemen like me around


101
00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.305
to pick up the slack.

102
00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.684
Just look at her.
Legs like a racehorse.


103
00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:17.563
Perfect yoga bum.
I give her my highest grade...


104
00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:19.940
A-minus.

105
00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:32.870
Where did we tell the old man
we were going tonight?


106
00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.330
A movie.

107
00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:36.207
Treasure, please, no...

108
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.543
Stop messing about.
You'll ruin my presets.


109
00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:40.837
Sorry.

110
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.213
What movie?

111
00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:44.507
I don't know. What's the difference?

112
00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:48.261
The difference is,
the more detail you give


113
00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:50.096
the less interested he'll be.

114
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:51.597
It wouldn't matter what I said.

115
00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:54.058
It would never occur to Phil
that another man


116
00:07:54.142 --> 00:07:55.351
would ever look twice at me.

117
00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:57.895
Dor, darling,
you fishing for a compliment?


118
00:07:58.354 --> 00:07:59.522
No.

119
00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:00.648
You should know by now

120
00:08:00.732 --> 00:08:03.026
they only come from me
when least expected.


121
00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:07.780
Now, come and have a mint
so Phil doesn't smell


122
00:08:07.864 --> 00:08:08.948
the Alfie on your breath.

123
00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:10.658
I don't care if he does.

124
00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:14.621
There's one thing
that puts me off marriage.


125
00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:15.914
It's married women.

126
00:08:17.082 --> 00:08:18.166
Dorie doesn't know it yet

127
00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:21.086
but you won't be seeing
much more of her.


128
00:08:22.337 --> 00:08:24.714
I've got that
all-too-familiar feeling.


129
00:08:25.173 --> 00:08:26.341
Sooner or later

130
00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:29.844
she'll be wanting a little bit more
than I'm able to give.


131
00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:33.473
Wouldn't it be great
if I was going home with you tonight


132
00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:35.433
instead of Phil the Pill?

133
00:08:36.768 --> 00:08:37.811
<i>Yeah.</i>

134
00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:41.565
<i>It's definitely time
to stage a disappearing act.</i>


135
00:08:45.152 --> 00:08:48.739
So next Tuesday,
same time, same place?


136
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.659
I'm sorry, love, it's Fashion Week.
I'm booked double shifts.


137
00:08:54.453 --> 00:08:56.371
I'll call you
the instant things let up.


138
00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:57.581
Okay.

139
00:08:58.206 --> 00:09:01.376
In the meantime, I left you
a little souvenir to remember me by.


140
00:09:06.381 --> 00:09:07.466
Oh, Dor?

141
00:09:10.052 --> 00:09:13.722
Your derrière looks really rather
ravishing from this vantage point.


142
00:09:17.142 --> 00:09:18.227
See?

143
00:09:19.353 --> 00:09:22.564
A compliment when least expected.

144
00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:32.741
What can I say?
Happy as a pup with two tails.


145
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.119
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.


146
00:09:35.202 --> 00:09:37.621
And I think I've done old Phil
a bit of a favor too.


147
00:09:38.747 --> 00:09:40.541
Of course,
he'd be the last to see it.


148
00:09:43.586 --> 00:09:46.505
Never expect any thanks in this life.

149
00:09:47.214 --> 00:09:48.507
You know what I mean?

150
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:50.426
So, Tuesday...

151
00:09:53.471 --> 00:09:54.805
10.03pm.

152
00:09:55.723 --> 00:10:00.686
Do I drag myself home
to a cold flat, empty fridge


153
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.273
or nip across town for a hot bath

154
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:07.777
warm body, breakfast in bed?

155
00:10:11.114 --> 00:10:13.241
Decisions...

156
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:25.962
<i>Yeah, I think I'll pay a visit
to my semi-regular</i>


157
00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:28.172
<i>quasi, sort of girlfriend.</i>

158
00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:31.718
<i>My sweet Julie.</i>

159
00:10:38.308 --> 00:10:40.769
Let me guess.
Unexpected last-minute fare.


160
00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:43.646
Yeah. She had me going
up and down for hours.


161
00:10:44.064 --> 00:10:46.983
That supposed to be funny?
Because it is so very...


162
00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:49.569
not.

163
00:10:51.196 --> 00:10:52.405
Hey!

164
00:10:53.657 --> 00:10:54.991
I'm not kidding, Alfie!

165
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:57.911
I'm not kidding.
I hate you sometimes.


166
00:10:58.036 --> 00:11:00.247
You have a very ostentatious way
of showing it.


167
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.581
Yeah, I sure do.

168
00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:06.920
No, darling. Can we hit pause?

169
00:11:07.003 --> 00:11:08.880
I just need a second to unwind.

170
00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:12.759
I nicked half a bottle of Stoli
from the limo.


171
00:11:12.843 --> 00:11:14.511
How do you want yours, on the rocks?

172
00:11:14.594 --> 00:11:17.514
I just want my usual, Alfie.
Straight up.


173
00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:19.057
No, I'm so totally knackered.

174
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:20.809
I'll make it up to you
in the morning.


175
00:11:20.892 --> 00:11:23.020
Cross my heart.

176
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.399
But tonight,
all I'm good for is a bite to eat


177
00:11:27.482 --> 00:11:29.943
hot bath, and a nice long sleep.

178
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.710
You know,
this isn't a Holiday Inn, Alfie.


179
00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:49.171
What's that again?

180
00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:52.508
Where were you tonight? Really?

181
00:11:53.342 --> 00:11:56.011
You've got to open a restaurant.
That's seriously delicious.


182
00:11:56.095 --> 00:11:58.305
Thanks, Alfie. 
It's just chili.

183
00:12:00.057 --> 00:12:01.225
Hey.

184
00:12:02.476 --> 00:12:04.353
A little eye contact, please.

185
00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:08.691
We have something here

186
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:14.697
or am I just a glorified booty call?

187
00:12:15.197 --> 00:12:16.407
Hey.

188
00:12:19.577 --> 00:12:20.620
Hey.

189
00:12:23.998 --> 00:12:25.625
Here's what she's really saying.

190
00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:30.505
She wants me to commit.
Translation? Become "domestified."


191
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:35.092
Now, it doesn't do to become
dependent on anybody in this life.


192
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.016
Change your nature,
you're a dead man.


193
00:12:44.602 --> 00:12:45.978
Chili, please.

194
00:12:51.943 --> 00:12:54.571
Don't get me wrong. 
She's adorable.

195
00:12:55.238 --> 00:12:58.032
Cute? Absolutely.
But is it ever enough?


196
00:13:00.952 --> 00:13:04.038
I told you how we men are.
We want showstoppers.


197
00:13:04.622 --> 00:13:07.250
And the problem is,
Julie hasn't got enough


198
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:09.252
of the superficial things
that really matter.


199
00:13:13.423 --> 00:13:16.384
- I don't deserve you.
- Yeah, that's probably true.


200
00:13:18.094 --> 00:13:19.763
Too bad I love you.

201
00:13:22.682 --> 00:13:23.892
Thanks, babe.

202
00:13:24.768 --> 00:13:26.061
- Alfie...
- What?


203
00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:27.187
Alfie.

204
00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:34.277
You're giving me the "Thanks, babe."
You're giving me the "Thanks, baby."


205
00:13:34.402 --> 00:13:36.947
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!


206
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.824
- I know how you feel!
- Wait a minute.


207
00:13:38.907 --> 00:13:40.409
- You're gonna wake up...
- Max.


208
00:13:42.494 --> 00:13:44.496
Hey, little man. 
Did we wake you up?

209
00:13:44.997 --> 00:13:46.039
Yes.

210
00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:52.629
Now, lads, learn from my mistake.

211
00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:56.341
Never get involved with a single mum.

212
00:13:56.717 --> 00:14:00.846
See, they come with accessories,
some of which can be...


213
00:14:02.556 --> 00:14:05.434
unfortunately, irresistible.

214
00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:27.915
Sights like that make you realize
we all have an expiration date.


215
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.628
And women do have a shorter
shelf life than men, don't they?


216
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:35.423
I think that's what Julie
was banging on about yesterday.


217
00:14:38.092 --> 00:14:40.886
<i>Elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.</i>

218
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.390
This is where I make
my reasonably honest living.


219
00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:48.769
Standards of elegance has taken
quite a pounding, wouldn't you say?


220
00:14:49.228 --> 00:14:52.273
I know. Believe me,
it's merely a stepping stone.


221
00:14:53.232 --> 00:14:56.235
Currently parked on one of those
stepping stones is my best mate


222
00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:59.238
and future business partner, Marlon.

223
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.411
Black. Like Lonette's skin...

224
00:15:07.622 --> 00:15:09.791
which I will never again touch.

225
00:15:12.794 --> 00:15:15.588
I'm afraid you're not meeting my man
on top form.


226
00:15:17.507 --> 00:15:19.342
See, Marlon's got a problem.

227
00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:32.647
<i>It's called Lonette.</i>

228
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.192
<i>And very recently, it dumped him.</i>

229
00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:38.319
<i>Oh, dear.
Come on, what was it this time?</i>


230
00:15:39.696 --> 00:15:42.741
Three-a.m. begging, at her front
door.


231
00:15:42.824 --> 00:15:45.702
- Level of inebriation?
- Vomiting.


232
00:15:46.202 --> 00:15:47.579
Right. So let me get this straight.

233
00:15:47.662 --> 00:15:50.165
You were at her front door,

234
00:15:50.248 --> 00:15:51.416
begging and vomiting?

235
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:55.670
And what, she wasn't charmed by that?

236
00:15:57.797 --> 00:15:58.924
Alfie?

237
00:15:59.174 --> 00:16:01.760
Why is there no Stoli
in car number two?


238
00:16:03.178 --> 00:16:04.346
I've no idea.

239
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.849
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.

240
00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.769
That little chap's name is Wing.

241
00:16:10.852 --> 00:16:14.272
My boss and owner
of this tragic enterprise.


242
00:16:14.356 --> 00:16:17.109
- Wipe that car good.
- Owner, that is, till me and Marlon


243
00:16:17.192 --> 00:16:19.987
swing a loan and buy it out
from underneath his scrawny...


244
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.155
Hello. You miss bird shit.

245
00:16:25.993 --> 00:16:27.119
Wing.

246
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.454
He's barking mad.

247
00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:32.207
Check out the way he talks
to the little woman.


248
00:16:34.918 --> 00:16:37.880
She's given him her best years,
cooked his chop suey


249
00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:40.007
helped with the business,
and I bet at one time


250
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.009
he couldn't wait
to rip off her kimono.


251
00:16:42.384 --> 00:16:43.469
And now look at him.

252
00:16:47.514 --> 00:16:50.476
And I'm supposed to respect
the institution of marriage?


253
00:16:55.272 --> 00:16:56.774
That's a great figure, man.

254
00:16:56.857 --> 00:17:01.070
We swing that loan, cash your IRA,
I hock my Vespa...


255
00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:05.157
We're gonna take Wing by surprise
with an offer like this.


256
00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:14.583
I could've predicted this.

257
00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:17.670
See, Marlon and Lonette
have reached that critical 18-month


258
00:17:17.753 --> 00:17:20.047
"Where are we going, what are we
doing, what's happening here"


259
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:23.384
crisis point that rears
its ugly head in every relationship.


260
00:17:23.926 --> 00:17:26.888
Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.

261
00:17:26.971 --> 00:17:29.390
Marlon wanted another 18 months

262
00:17:29.474 --> 00:17:32.351
to make sure nothing better
was coming his way.


263
00:17:32.435 --> 00:17:34.437
I fucked up egregiously.

264
00:17:34.812 --> 00:17:36.814
I see you're making the most
of that birthday calendar.


265
00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:40.777
By the time he realized
he'd made a mistake


266
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.070
and he wanted her back...

267
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.864
it was too late.

268
00:17:44.948 --> 00:17:46.783
Hey, stranger.

269
00:17:48.451 --> 00:17:49.577
Hey.

270
00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:57.418
Carol.

271
00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:00.630
- Carol. Hi, Carol.
- Hi.


272
00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:03.007
Hi. You look wonderful.

273
00:18:07.637 --> 00:18:09.806
So, Carol,
well, it's nice to see you again.


274
00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:10.932
You be well.

275
00:18:19.774 --> 00:18:20.859
What's up with that?

276
00:18:21.276 --> 00:18:24.488
Put it this way, the show closed
after one performance only.


277
00:18:25.113 --> 00:18:26.698
- Do I even wanna know why?
- No.


278
00:18:26.781 --> 00:18:29.367
Come on, it would be
less than discreet to tell you why.


279
00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:34.414
Hair on the arms. Seriously.

280
00:18:34.498 --> 00:18:35.624
Long, thick...

281
00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:38.126
What are you talking about?
You don't have hair on your arms?


282
00:18:40.212 --> 00:18:41.713
You're looking very lovely tonight.

283
00:18:41.797 --> 00:18:42.923
Thank you.

284
00:18:51.223 --> 00:18:54.309
Dude, the iron door
has slammed shut, man.


285
00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:00.023
Classic, isn't it?

286
00:19:00.482 --> 00:19:03.235
Now that he can't have her,
he thinks he can't live without her.


287
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.155
Some people are funny.

288
00:19:08.157 --> 00:19:10.659
<i>Marlon's predicament got me
thinking about my own situation.</i>


289
00:19:14.413 --> 00:19:17.666
<i>Maybe it was time
to stoke the home fires.</i>


290
00:19:21.545 --> 00:19:24.423
Anybody in the mood
for a little Alfie, straight up?


291
00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:26.675
This isn't a good time, Alfie.

292
00:19:27.426 --> 00:19:28.803
Got a lot on my mind.

293
00:19:29.261 --> 00:19:32.640
Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate
when that happens.


294
00:19:33.682 --> 00:19:35.059
Open up, baby.

295
00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:38.229
You look seriously beautiful.

296
00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:41.899
- Not tonight, Alfred.
- What's the matter? Tell me.


297
00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:43.109
- I don't... I'm just...
- What?


298
00:19:43.192 --> 00:19:45.236
Well, I guess I'm just...

299
00:19:46.195 --> 00:19:48.823
I'm just... seeing red.

300
00:20:05.048 --> 00:20:06.758
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.

301
00:20:07.175 --> 00:20:09.594
Come on, haven't you?
You've tortured him long enough.


302
00:20:09.927 --> 00:20:11.804
Alfie, he should've thought
about all that


303
00:20:11.888 --> 00:20:14.682
before he was screwing around
with that ex-girlfriend of his.


304
00:20:15.058 --> 00:20:17.435
Those fake-ass, five-dollar titties.

305
00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:20.230
- Those are fake?
- Hello?


306
00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:23.733
I'm devastated. 
They've got, like...

307
00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:27.612
Alfie, you're supposed to be
consoling my devastation, remember?


308
00:20:27.695 --> 00:20:30.990
Yeah, I am.
Look, he came back, didn't he?


309
00:20:31.074 --> 00:20:33.451
Begging, crawling on his knees,
vomiting...


310
00:20:33.535 --> 00:20:36.746
I don't care.
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy.


311
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.499
I don't forgive
and I definitely do not forget.


312
00:20:39.582 --> 00:20:42.043
- Is okay if I leave now, miss?
<i>- Sí,</i> Felix.


313
00:20:42.127 --> 00:20:44.045
And hit the lights
on your way out, <i>por favor.</i>


314
00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.218
I better go.

315
00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:53.138
It's really coming down out there.

316
00:20:53.972 --> 00:20:55.015
Yeah.

317
00:20:56.725 --> 00:20:58.185
And I'm wearing suede.

318
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.938
You're telling the truth.
That's brilliant.


319
00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:07.736
Okay. I got one.
I never swam in the Pacific Ocean.


320
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.365
- Me neither.
- Oh, shit. Okay.


321
00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:15.244
Okay.

322
00:21:15.327 --> 00:21:18.664
I've never seen a James Bond movie.

323
00:21:20.415 --> 00:21:22.376
You're joking.
Not even a Sean Connery?


324
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.711
You serious?

325
00:21:24.962 --> 00:21:29.049
Wow, I don't know
if that's magic or tragic.


326
00:21:30.843 --> 00:21:32.553
Okay. Five ball. My go.

327
00:21:33.387 --> 00:21:37.516
- I've never made my own bed.
- Oh, bullshit.


328
00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:39.226
No, I repeat,
I've never made my own bed.


329
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:41.478
Well, what kind of mama you got?

330
00:21:43.022 --> 00:21:44.231
That's a good question.

331
00:21:51.447 --> 00:21:53.073
Let's see. All right.

332
00:21:53.824 --> 00:21:55.910
- I got something for you.
- All right.


333
00:21:57.536 --> 00:21:58.996
I've never had sex...

334
00:21:59.955 --> 00:22:02.458
I've never had sex
with two people in one night.


335
00:22:04.251 --> 00:22:05.795
Six-five, your favor.

336
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:07.880
Gotcha.

337
00:22:11.217 --> 00:22:13.261
So, Alfie, what's the most
you've had in one night?


338
00:22:18.558 --> 00:22:20.226
We've stopped playing the game,
haven't we?


339
00:22:24.647 --> 00:22:28.276
Am I wrong, or is there a little
innocent flirting going on here?


340
00:22:41.748 --> 00:22:45.084
<i>Driftin' on a memory</i>

341
00:22:46.586 --> 00:22:51.007
<i>Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you</i>


342
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.179
<i>Loving you</i>

343
00:23:06.064 --> 00:23:07.816
See, if I had that kind of talent...

344
00:23:08.608 --> 00:23:10.860
<i>And a song...</i>

345
00:23:10.944 --> 00:23:12.320
Go on, finish your sentence.

346
00:23:12.404 --> 00:23:17.492
If I had that kind of talent,
and I looked like you...


347
00:23:17.993 --> 00:23:19.536
<i>And a song...</i>

348
00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:21.496
...I would be strutting my stuff...

349
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.457
- Oh, yeah?
- ...on a stage.


350
00:23:45.103 --> 00:23:48.440
<i>Trust me, what happens next
was the furthest thing from my mind</i>


351
00:23:48.524 --> 00:23:50.025
<i>when I dropped by tonight.</i>

352
00:23:52.027 --> 00:23:56.573
<i>But then I thought to myself,
"You know what?</i>


353
00:23:57.449 --> 00:24:00.160
<i>If this will help her
get past her anger towards Marlon</i>


354
00:24:00.244 --> 00:24:03.956
<i>I owe it to both of them,
as a friend, right?</i>


355
00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:05.749
<i>To do whatever I can to help."</i>

356
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.341
<i>I find that, lately</i>

357
00:24:15.593 --> 00:24:17.344
<i>even lying to myself comes easily.</i>

358
00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.104
<i>The next morning</i>

359
00:25:08.187 --> 00:25:10.106
<i>and I can't get last night
out of my mind.</i>


360
00:25:10.189 --> 00:25:11.649
<i>So, Alfie,
what's the most you've had...</i>


361
00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:15.945
<i>Try desperately to focus
on something else, anything else.</i>


362
00:25:16.404 --> 00:25:20.158
<i>Anything to get my mind off
my best friend's incredibly hot</i>


363
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:23.578
<i>best-ass-I've-ever-seen-in-my-life
girlfriend.</i>


364
00:25:25.872 --> 00:25:27.082
Alfie.

365
00:25:27.374 --> 00:25:31.086
- Alfie...
- Shall I pretend I can't hear him?


366
00:25:31.795 --> 00:25:33.004
Dude.

367
00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:37.092
- Hey!
- Too late...


368
00:25:37.175 --> 00:25:40.303
- Dude, would you slow down?
- Hey, Marly, what's up?


369
00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:42.264
"Marly"?

370
00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:44.266
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you.

371
00:25:44.349 --> 00:25:45.725
You know what,
you ain't going nowhere


372
00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:47.435
till you tell me
what went down last night.


373
00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:50.021
- Down last night?
- Dude, don't mess with me.


374
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.857
What happened with Lonette?

375
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.235
Have you ever heard the word "knock"?

376
00:25:56.069 --> 00:25:59.031
- What went down?
- What? Nothing happened.


377
00:25:59.114 --> 00:26:02.034
- We had a few shots.
- Missus give me silent treatment.


378
00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:05.495
Little she know, not hearing
constant "blah, blah, blah"


379
00:26:05.579 --> 00:26:06.622
is gift from heaven.

380
00:26:06.705 --> 00:26:08.332
You keep it up.
Keep it up, mate, it'll work.


381
00:26:08.415 --> 00:26:09.833
Alfie, what happened?

382
00:26:12.794 --> 00:26:14.963
Fuck a duck, man. Look, I...

383
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:18.717
- I drank a lot last night.
- Drunk.


384
00:26:19.802 --> 00:26:21.762
Well, I...

385
00:26:23.597 --> 00:26:25.808
I really... I don't remember.

386
00:26:25.891 --> 00:26:28.727
- Dude, you did something to her.
- No.


387
00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:30.979
Yeah, you did.
Because she shows up at my house


388
00:26:31.063 --> 00:26:33.357
at four in the morning,
saying that she wanted me back.


389
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.568
She even said that
if I needed more time


390
00:26:36.652 --> 00:26:38.153
that she understood completely.

391
00:26:39.697 --> 00:26:41.115
How fucking crazy.

392
00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:45.369
Chalk one up for the blokes.

393
00:26:45.703 --> 00:26:48.164
Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.

394
00:26:48.581 --> 00:26:50.749
Which means he's off scot-free,
and so am I.


395
00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:53.711
This is a bloody miracle.
That's fantastic. Fantastic.


396
00:26:53.794 --> 00:26:55.379
Come on, what did you say to her?
Come on.


397
00:26:55.463 --> 00:26:57.757
- Look... It's all good.
- Come on, what did you say?


398
00:27:00.259 --> 00:27:01.719
I asked her to marry me.

399
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.143
You know you're my best man, right?

400
00:27:11.187 --> 00:27:12.730
<i>Moral of the story?</i>

401
00:27:13.439 --> 00:27:15.691
<i>No good deed goes unpunished.</i>

402
00:28:12.707 --> 00:28:14.251
<i>New word for the day?</i>

403
00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:18.630
<i>Resilience.</i>

404
00:28:18.713 --> 00:28:22.884
<i>The ability to readily recover
after disappointment or loss.</i>


405
00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.514
Capacity to spring back.

406
00:28:28.432 --> 00:28:30.726
<i>Understand,
it's not about replacing Julie.</i>


407
00:28:31.768 --> 00:28:33.478
<i>I just wanna get back
to the simple life.</i>


408
00:28:34.313 --> 00:28:36.231
<i>Women who mean nothing to me.</i>

409
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:42.696
<i>So I've struck up a friendship
with a nightclub hostess called Uta.</i>


410
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.573
Hello, Uta.

411
00:28:59.296 --> 00:29:01.715
Now, as a heat-seeking bachelor

412
00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:03.801
I have to live
by some very simple rules.


413
00:29:03.884 --> 00:29:09.098
Alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy,
which is probably best summed up


414
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:12.560
by the only advice
my father ever gave me.


415
00:29:12.643 --> 00:29:16.230
He said, "Son, whenever you meet
a beautiful woman...


416
00:29:18.566 --> 00:29:21.777
just remember, somewhere there's
a bloke who's sick of shagging her."


417
00:29:22.737 --> 00:29:25.114
- Can I help you, man?
- G and T, please.


418
00:29:25.573 --> 00:29:29.118
Explain to me what everyone sees
in that Eurotrash.


419
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.641
I think it's incredibly unfair
that it's acceptable for men


420
00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:53.476
to be sexually experimental,
than with a woman


421
00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:54.936
if she wants to try something...

422
00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:58.231
a kiss or a threesome.

423
00:29:58.314 --> 00:30:01.025
You know, that they'd be judged.
I wouldn't judge them.


424
00:30:01.109 --> 00:30:02.860
And I think if you two
were to kiss, I would...


425
00:30:02.944 --> 00:30:07.991
I would just see it
as a thing of beauty.


426
00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:13.288
<i>Although I'm living every guy's
Rat Pack fantasy</i>


427
00:30:13.371 --> 00:30:15.457
<i>something feels a bit off.</i>

428
00:30:15.957 --> 00:30:17.959
<i>And throwing myself back
into the old lifestyle</i>


429
00:30:18.042 --> 00:30:20.462
<i>isn't going quite as smoothly
as I'd hoped.</i>


430
00:30:20.545 --> 00:30:22.881
Sorry. I'm sorry.

431
00:30:24.507 --> 00:30:26.009
You carry on without me.

432
00:30:27.344 --> 00:30:29.179
Oh, my loves, I...

433
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:32.557
I don't know what happened.
This is so unlike me.


434
00:30:34.017 --> 00:30:36.519
Yeah, you... you two just...

435
00:30:44.653 --> 00:30:47.114
<i>I used to think there was nothing
worse than death.</i>


436
00:30:50.534 --> 00:30:52.577
<i>Then, from out of nowhere...</i>

437
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:56.915
the unthinkable.

438
00:30:59.126 --> 00:31:02.004
Now, I really don't get
what everyone sees in you.


439
00:31:06.717 --> 00:31:09.553
It just keeps on happening
and happening.


440
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.640
Or more accurately,
not happening and not happening.


441
00:31:15.809 --> 00:31:19.271
This never happens, Uta.
Honestly, never.


442
00:31:22.566 --> 00:31:23.776
Honestly.

443
00:31:24.651 --> 00:31:26.320
Not the word around town.

444
00:31:28.656 --> 00:31:29.823
"Peewee."

445
00:31:35.663 --> 00:31:37.122
- Mr. Elkins?
- Yes.


446
00:31:37.206 --> 00:31:38.290
Miranda Kulp.

447
00:31:40.417 --> 00:31:41.710
Miranda.

448
00:31:42.253 --> 00:31:45.089
The penis doctor is a he
with a little bit of she thrown in.


449
00:31:45.172 --> 00:31:48.509
So I understand you're experiencing
some erectile dysfunction.


450
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.180
I am experiencing a little...
a little bit of...


451
00:31:53.264 --> 00:31:54.306
What you just said.

452
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.767
Not to worry.
That's my area of expertise.


453
00:31:57.643 --> 00:32:02.106
So have you been under any unusual
emotional stress lately, Mr. Elkins?


454
00:32:02.189 --> 00:32:05.776
Stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.

455
00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:11.491
Well, unless you count...
that recent chat I had with Julie.


456
00:32:12.158 --> 00:32:13.785
I can't see you anymore, Alfie.

457
00:32:15.787 --> 00:32:18.081
- Why? You angry?
- No, I'm really not angry.


458
00:32:18.164 --> 00:32:21.501
Just, you know,
we want different things.


459
00:32:22.835 --> 00:32:25.797
And I can't have you traipsing
in and out of Max's life.


460
00:32:30.969 --> 00:32:32.971
You've changed your hair,
haven't you?


461
00:32:34.013 --> 00:32:35.265
- You have, haven't you?
- Yeah.


462
00:32:35.348 --> 00:32:36.683
No, you have.
You've changed your hairdo.


463
00:32:36.766 --> 00:32:39.352
You cut it? It looks gorgeous.

464
00:32:39.936 --> 00:32:41.437
- Thanks.
- How come...


465
00:32:43.356 --> 00:32:44.899
How come you never...
had it like that


466
00:32:44.983 --> 00:32:46.359
when... we were together?

467
00:32:46.443 --> 00:32:47.861
I really gotta go.

468
00:32:52.073 --> 00:32:55.827
Well, I guess you need these back.

469
00:32:58.997 --> 00:33:00.248
Thank you.

470
00:33:05.003 --> 00:33:06.087
Alfie?

471
00:33:07.422 --> 00:33:08.715
You gonna be okay?

472
00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:12.260
Yeah. No worries. 
I'm always okay.

473
00:33:18.266 --> 00:33:21.770
All righty, let's take a gander
at that penis of yours.


474
00:33:29.987 --> 00:33:31.113
I see.

475
00:33:36.326 --> 00:33:38.203
- Hello.
- Well.


476
00:33:38.787 --> 00:33:41.623
- It seems we have lift-off.
- It seems we do.


477
00:33:41.707 --> 00:33:42.791
<i>Wunderschön.</i>

478
00:33:43.709 --> 00:33:45.002
What a relief.

479
00:33:45.878 --> 00:33:47.379
Well, I mean,
if he can give me a stiffy


480
00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:49.006
I should have no problem
keeping it up


481
00:33:49.089 --> 00:33:51.675
for the target demographic,
shouldn't I?


482
00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:54.678
Well, there doesn't appear to be
anything physiologically wrong.


483
00:33:54.762 --> 00:33:56.388
- No.
- So, in short


484
00:33:56.472 --> 00:33:59.808
we can be fairly certain your problem
was simply stress-related.


485
00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:02.311
Translation, Julie-related.

486
00:34:02.394 --> 00:34:04.772
Like I always say,
if they don't get you one way


487
00:34:05.147 --> 00:34:06.524
they'll get you another.

488
00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:09.109
However...

489
00:34:10.528 --> 00:34:14.365
I did feel something a little kooky.

490
00:34:15.157 --> 00:34:16.283
Kooky?

491
00:34:16.367 --> 00:34:19.120
There is nothing to get upset about,
Mr. Elkins.


492
00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:23.207
I thought I felt a lump...

493
00:34:25.293 --> 00:34:26.585
on your penis.

494
00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:29.297
But with any luck,
it will be nothing.


495
00:34:31.924 --> 00:34:34.802
The words "lump" and "penis"
in the same sentence.


496
00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:37.388
There's something
you don't hear every day.


497
00:34:39.098 --> 00:34:43.311
<i>And so young Alfred
got an early Yuletide gift.</i>


498
00:34:45.104 --> 00:34:47.023
A penis biopsy.

499
00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:49.275
I get my test results
in three days...


500
00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:52.278
Well, five.
Five counting the weekend.


501
00:34:52.362 --> 00:34:54.572
Oh, Lord...

502
00:34:54.781 --> 00:34:57.283
How am I gonna stop myself
going completely bonkers?


503
00:34:57.742 --> 00:35:00.870
I'll be fine...

504
00:35:01.704 --> 00:35:03.122
I'm a young man.

505
00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:07.877
Shift focus, Alfie. Shift...

506
00:35:08.419 --> 00:35:10.463
Let's go, kids. Let's go.

507
00:35:18.346 --> 00:35:20.849
Move along, children.
Look straight ahead.


508
00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:24.227
Come on. Do not look at the man.
Look straight ahead.


509
00:35:24.311 --> 00:35:27.731
In the meantime,
perhaps I'm safer hobbling on home.


510
00:35:44.539 --> 00:35:46.124
Alfie, dear, what's wrong?

511
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:48.794
- You look like death warmed over.
- No, I've just...


512
00:35:48.877 --> 00:35:51.213
I've got a bit of a football injury,
that's all, Mrs. Schnitman.


513
00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:52.798
- Hello, Mrs. Liberman.
- Hello.


514
00:35:52.881 --> 00:35:54.383
You two look lovely. 
Where you going?

515
00:35:54.466 --> 00:35:56.510
- Shopping. You need anything?
- I'm fine.


516
00:36:00.055 --> 00:36:01.098
Hello.

517
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.267
Can I talk to you for a minute?

518
00:36:04.268 --> 00:36:05.853
Ladies, this is my friend Lonette.

519
00:36:05.936 --> 00:36:10.107
She's lovely. Good for you,
dating an African-American.


520
00:36:10.566 --> 00:36:11.692
Yeah.

521
00:36:13.485 --> 00:36:14.528
Hey.

522
00:36:14.862 --> 00:36:17.448
Hey, girl. I missed you.

523
00:36:17.823 --> 00:36:21.493
Don't mind us. We're not here.
You kids keep talking.


524
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.538
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you, Mrs. Liberman.


525
00:36:24.622 --> 00:36:26.040
Shop till you drop, girls.

526
00:36:29.168 --> 00:36:30.544
So how... have you been?

527
00:36:32.963 --> 00:36:34.298
I'm pregnant.

528
00:36:36.592 --> 00:36:38.469
<i>It seems to me</i>

529
00:36:38.552 --> 00:36:40.304
<i>the problems
you worry yourself sick about</i>


530
00:36:40.387 --> 00:36:41.972
<i>never seem to materialize.</i>

531
00:36:42.598 --> 00:36:44.558
<i>It's the ones that catch
you unexpectedly</i>


532
00:36:45.017 --> 00:36:48.104
<i>on a Wednesday afternoon
that knock you sideways.</i>


533
00:36:50.564 --> 00:36:52.566
<i>I offered
to face the music with her...</i>


534
00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:54.944
<i>but she wanted to go it alone.</i>

535
00:37:13.421 --> 00:37:15.131
<i>We both knew
that if the baby was born</i>


536
00:37:15.214 --> 00:37:17.091
<i>with any white-boy features</i>

537
00:37:17.759 --> 00:37:19.594
<i>it would mean the end
of Lonette and Marlon.</i>


538
00:37:21.095 --> 00:37:23.765
Not to mention,
your host for this evening.


539
00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:29.896
<i>But standing in the cold,
I find myself having regrets.</i>


540
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:32.065
<i>Thinking thoughts like</i>

541
00:37:32.565 --> 00:37:37.278
<i>"Here's another kid you'll never get
a chance to know. Your own."</i>


542
00:37:56.256 --> 00:37:57.507
Didn't take long.

543
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.018
Bloody hell, you're freezing.

544
00:38:11.605 --> 00:38:12.689
How do you feel?

545
00:38:13.815 --> 00:38:14.858
Empty.

546
00:38:29.331 --> 00:38:30.457
That night in the bar

547
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:32.209
I thought I was getting something
for nothing.


548
00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:36.797
Doesn't seem to have worked out
that way, does it?


549
00:38:48.308 --> 00:38:50.561
<i>Good morning, Dr. 
Kulp's office...</i>

550
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.398
<i>Oh, man. If everything turns out okay</i>

551
00:38:54.481 --> 00:38:57.651
<i>maybe this little brush
with mortality is a sign.</i>


552
00:38:58.527 --> 00:39:02.323
<i>I should think about making
some changes.</i>


553
00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.533
Possibly.

554
00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.661
- Next week.
- Excuse me. Did I just...


555
00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:10.039
Did you just look at me?
Did I just notice you turn away?


556
00:39:10.122 --> 00:39:12.333
Look, if you know the results
to my tests


557
00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.542
and they're telling you...

558
00:39:13.626 --> 00:39:15.711
- Mr. Elkins.
- Please...


559
00:39:15.795 --> 00:39:16.837
- Mr. Elkins.
- Yes.


560
00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:20.216
For the millionth time, sit down.

561
00:39:21.133 --> 00:39:26.430
Mr. Belson, I have a cancellation
on Tuesday at 11.30.


562
00:39:26.514 --> 00:39:27.557
I'm gonna be fine.

563
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.433
Would you like me
to slot you in, then?


564
00:39:29.892 --> 00:39:32.395
- I just feel it.
- Thank you. Goodbye.


565
00:39:40.903 --> 00:39:43.573
I'll just be a minute. Or ten.

566
00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:47.285
- It's all right. Take your time.
- I don't have a choice.


567
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.871
I used to pee. Now, I trickle.

568
00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:53.082
- I'm Joe. What's your name?
- Alfie.


569
00:39:54.834 --> 00:39:56.377
So how you doing, Alfie?

570
00:39:57.545 --> 00:40:00.548
- Hanging in. You?
- Shitty.


571
00:40:02.884 --> 00:40:05.053
Yeah, me too...

572
00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:09.516
- I like the bolo tie.
- Thanks. I have a collection.


573
00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:15.563
You know, when you're old,
you learn to be patient.


574
00:40:16.731 --> 00:40:19.192
Yeah. Used to be
I never had time for nothing.


575
00:40:19.275 --> 00:40:20.402
Go...

576
00:40:20.485 --> 00:40:22.404
- I know that feeling.
- Yeah.


577
00:40:22.737 --> 00:40:25.031
My wife was always hawking me
to take a little vacation.


578
00:40:25.115 --> 00:40:26.741
Hawaii. Reno.

579
00:40:27.576 --> 00:40:29.703
I always said,
"Next year, Evie, next year.


580
00:40:29.786 --> 00:40:31.580
I got too much on my platter."

581
00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:34.708
I always thought I'd have more time.

582
00:40:35.417 --> 00:40:36.585
Then one Sunday night

583
00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:39.337
she takes the pot roast
out of the oven.


584
00:40:39.421 --> 00:40:42.549
Yells, "Soup's on,"
and slumps to the kitchen floor.


585
00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:44.718
Just like that.

586
00:40:45.594 --> 00:40:47.054
Dead as disco.

587
00:40:47.512 --> 00:40:49.097
Jesus, I'm sorry.

588
00:40:50.223 --> 00:40:51.975
I tried picking up the pieces.

589
00:40:52.893 --> 00:40:55.562
Even went to Waikiki alone
on the eight-day cruise package


590
00:40:55.646 --> 00:40:57.314
she was always yakking about.

591
00:40:58.899 --> 00:41:00.609
Couldn't get Evie out of my mind.

592
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.615
There's two things
I learned in life, kid.


593
00:41:07.366 --> 00:41:09.118
You find someone to love

594
00:41:09.827 --> 00:41:12.079
and live every day
as though it were your last.


595
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.003
She's all yours, Alfie. Enjoy.

596
00:41:27.845 --> 00:41:29.221
You all right, son?

597
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.057
Yeah. I hope so.

598
00:41:36.187 --> 00:41:39.440
Look, if you ever get bored
or feel like schmoozing...


599
00:41:41.025 --> 00:41:42.234
give me a holler.

600
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:47.156
- You'll never call.
- Maybe I will.


601
00:41:47.782 --> 00:41:48.866
All right, good.

602
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.660
We'll go to a bar together,
hit on some chicks.


603
00:41:50.743 --> 00:41:53.287
Damn right. Thanks, Joe.

604
00:41:56.874 --> 00:41:58.000
Hey.

605
00:42:00.545 --> 00:42:02.088
I'm... sorry about Evie.

606
00:42:05.383 --> 00:42:06.509
We...

607
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.178
we weren't all that fond
of each other...


608
00:42:10.096 --> 00:42:13.641
but we were... very close.

609
00:42:15.018 --> 00:42:16.352
If you know what I mean.

610
00:42:18.354 --> 00:42:19.647
I think I do.

611
00:42:46.132 --> 00:42:48.510
I've been thinking a lot lately
about God and death.


612
00:42:49.844 --> 00:42:52.889
And how, if what they taught me
in Bible class is true


613
00:42:52.973 --> 00:42:54.266
I'm really in for it.

614
00:42:57.936 --> 00:43:00.564
But I won't be partying with Lucifer
any time soon


615
00:43:00.772 --> 00:43:02.983
because my test results
were negative.


616
00:43:03.066 --> 00:43:05.610
I'm gonna live...

617
00:43:12.034 --> 00:43:14.453
I ruined my Prada lace-ups
and I don't care.


618
00:43:18.582 --> 00:43:22.336
Don't think I've forgotten my oath
to completely change my life


619
00:43:22.711 --> 00:43:24.046
because I haven't.

620
00:43:54.076 --> 00:43:56.245
Carrot-apple
with a dash of wheatgrass.


621
00:43:57.121 --> 00:43:58.289
Yep.

622
00:43:59.331 --> 00:44:02.334
Health is now priority number one.

623
00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:06.839
Business plan moves
onto the fast track.


624
00:44:08.716 --> 00:44:09.800
If you say so...

625
00:44:09.884 --> 00:44:12.553
Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...

626
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:18.643
No, I definitely don't want to talk.
Okay, hold on, what else have I got?


627
00:44:20.269 --> 00:44:23.064
Okay, yeah.

628
00:44:24.398 --> 00:44:26.150
All right, if we must,
we must, but...


629
00:44:27.985 --> 00:44:30.279
New slate. New beginning.

630
00:44:52.093 --> 00:44:53.887
- What's your name, driver?
- Alfie, sir.


631
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.013
Wait here, Alfie.

632
00:44:55.096 --> 00:44:57.182
Do you know how long
you're gonna be, roughly?


633
00:44:57.557 --> 00:44:58.892
You got someplace to go?

634
00:44:58.975 --> 00:45:01.186
No, I was just gonna nip off
and get a cup of tea.


635
00:45:01.269 --> 00:45:02.729
Look, why don't you just stay put?

636
00:45:30.924 --> 00:45:32.092
Yea or nay?

637
00:45:34.511 --> 00:45:37.014
A definite "yea," I think.

638
00:45:37.347 --> 00:45:40.684
Really. Stunning.
Wouldn't you say so, sir?


639
00:45:40.768 --> 00:45:43.437
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you
to wait by the car?


640
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.440
I reckoned I should help the lady
with her packages.


641
00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:47.692
Definite yea?

642
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:51.946
I think.

643
00:45:52.405 --> 00:45:54.907
With one minor...

644
00:45:55.575 --> 00:45:57.035
- May I?
- You may.


645
00:45:57.327 --> 00:45:58.494
Adjustment.

646
00:46:06.461 --> 00:46:08.422
Bullfighter. Another lifetime.

647
00:46:08.505 --> 00:46:09.673
Don't ask.

648
00:46:13.927 --> 00:46:15.220
Fifty, if she's a day.

649
00:46:15.637 --> 00:46:19.475
But don't they say 50 is the new 40,
and is she not living proof?


650
00:46:19.558 --> 00:46:22.353
I mean, have a look.
Beautifully preserved.


651
00:46:23.938 --> 00:46:25.773
And cleavage like the Holland Tunnel.

652
00:46:28.234 --> 00:46:29.861
- Better?
- Much.


653
00:46:30.486 --> 00:46:32.947
You are so right to trust Chanel.

654
00:46:33.031 --> 00:46:35.658
A pair of hot-pink stilettos,
and you're good to go.


655
00:46:37.118 --> 00:46:39.496
- Well, aren't you Mr. Full Service?
- We try.


656
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:44.918
He's getting a little pissy,
isn't he?


657
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:46.503
It's fine. It's good for him.

658
00:46:46.878 --> 00:46:48.130
Is your husband a lot older than you?

659
00:46:48.213 --> 00:46:49.673
He's not my husband.

660
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.968
He's wearing a wedding ring.

661
00:46:53.385 --> 00:46:56.472
Well, I never said he wasn't
somebody else's husband.


662
00:47:08.609 --> 00:47:09.944
- Grab the stuff from the trunk?
- You got it.


663
00:47:10.028 --> 00:47:11.112
Cheers.

664
00:47:17.952 --> 00:47:20.664
Ma'am, if you require my services
in the future.


665
00:47:22.791 --> 00:47:25.919
Happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.

666
00:47:28.255 --> 00:47:32.217
<i>Now that, my friends,
is a real woman.</i>


667
00:47:32.676 --> 00:47:35.679
<i>Smart and sexy and...</i>

668
00:47:36.222 --> 00:47:38.641
You noticed the little flirt
going on between us?


669
00:47:43.813 --> 00:47:47.025
Makes me think, if a woman like that

670
00:47:47.108 --> 00:47:50.987
of that caliber, should take notice
of a bloke like me, then...


671
00:47:52.322 --> 00:47:53.573
perhaps...

672
00:47:54.949 --> 00:47:57.744
Perhaps, I'm selling myself
a bit short.


673
00:47:59.287 --> 00:48:03.000
<i>In a flash,
I have my New Year's resolution.</i>


674
00:48:04.918 --> 00:48:06.211
<i>Aim higher.</i>

675
00:48:17.723 --> 00:48:20.810
Catastrophic. Doomed.

676
00:48:21.352 --> 00:48:24.522
Desolate. Cataclysmic.

677
00:48:24.897 --> 00:48:27.025
Bought him a word-of-the-day
calendar for Christmas.


678
00:48:27.734 --> 00:48:29.027
Big mistake.

679
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.363
Holiday season,
busiest time of the year.


680
00:48:31.446 --> 00:48:33.073
I try to run a business.

681
00:48:33.156 --> 00:48:37.786
- What's the problem, Mr. Wing?
- Your soul brother. He quit.


682
00:48:44.209 --> 00:48:47.338
<i>In the letter Marlon left me,
he called me his best friend...</i>


683
00:48:48.422 --> 00:48:51.926
<i>but apologized for bailing
on our business scheme.</i>


684
00:48:52.009 --> 00:48:55.054
<i>He said his whole thing now
was to make Lonette happy.</i>


685
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.764
<i>They decided</i>

686
00:48:56.847 --> 00:48:58.933
<i>on the spur of the moment,
to move upstate</i>


687
00:48:59.892 --> 00:49:02.228
<i>and I had a standing invite
to drop by any time.</i>


688
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:08.026
<i>Somehow Lonette convinced Marlon
it would be too painful</i>


689
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:10.070
<i>to say our goodbyes in person.</i>

690
00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:12.322
<i>And to make matters worse</i>

691
00:49:12.572 --> 00:49:15.701
<i>it all dovetails into the second
loneliest night of the year</i>


692
00:49:19.329 --> 00:49:20.873
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

693
00:49:23.375 --> 00:49:27.379
<i>A night that brings on
all those familiar festive feelings</i>


694
00:49:27.463 --> 00:49:32.426
<i>of hopelessness, anguish, despair.</i>

695
00:49:33.552 --> 00:49:36.222
<i>Not a great time to be flying solo.</i>

696
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:41.269
That's why I'm of the belief
couples should never split up


697
00:49:41.352 --> 00:49:43.813
between Thanksgiving and January 2nd.

698
00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.733
Always have a relationship
to see you through the holidays.


699
00:49:46.816 --> 00:49:48.026
Always.

700
00:49:48.526 --> 00:49:50.779
The downside, of course, being gifts.

701
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:59.121
Personally, I've always suspected
that everyone else


702
00:49:59.204 --> 00:50:01.790
is having a far merrier Christmas
than I am.


703
00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:05.127
Not that I've ever actually
had a Christmas.


704
00:50:06.754 --> 00:50:08.506
That's a whole other Dickens story.

705
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:09.674
Taxi.

706
00:50:10.383 --> 00:50:11.759
Taxi!

707
00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.010
Excuse me.

708
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:16.973
I'm sorry, mate

709
00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:19.058
it's against the law
for me to carry any more than...


710
00:50:27.609 --> 00:50:29.069
<i>Thank the Lord.</i>

711
00:50:31.279 --> 00:50:32.948
<i>A Christmas miracle.</i>

712
00:50:37.578 --> 00:50:38.787
All right, hop in.

713
00:50:40.331 --> 00:50:41.582
Thanks for saving us.

714
00:50:41.874 --> 00:50:44.376
- I was freezing my little tush off.
- No worries.


715
00:50:44.668 --> 00:50:47.046
You know, it's gonna be...
it's pretty full back there.


716
00:50:47.129 --> 00:50:51.259
- Why don't you...
- Good idea. Why don't I?


717
00:50:53.344 --> 00:50:55.221
Hey, watch the champagne.

718
00:50:59.559 --> 00:51:00.769
All in.

719
00:51:11.029 --> 00:51:12.489
They don't get out much.

720
00:51:12.573 --> 00:51:15.159
You wanna watch out, you guys.

721
00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:18.162
You'll end up with a lump of coal
in your stocking.


722
00:51:18.787 --> 00:51:22.583
You're English. 
I love English.

723
00:51:22.958 --> 00:51:24.835
- What's your name?
- Alfie.


724
00:51:33.094 --> 00:51:35.847
You wanna abuse
a little substance, Alfie?


725
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:37.766
No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

726
00:51:39.142 --> 00:51:41.311
All right. One hit.

727
00:51:56.577 --> 00:51:58.829
<i>- Merry Christmastime
- Merry Christmastime</i>


728
00:52:13.094 --> 00:52:16.640
There's an expression the Yanks use,
"Go with the flow."


729
00:52:18.892 --> 00:52:21.353
So, yeah, I got a dose
of the holiday blues.


730
00:52:21.436 --> 00:52:25.440
But when a girl
of this mind-blowing caliber


731
00:52:25.524 --> 00:52:26.775
invites you to a party

732
00:52:26.859 --> 00:52:29.903
it's time to get going
and start flowing.


733
00:52:33.574 --> 00:52:35.326
Maybe it's the late hour.

734
00:52:38.412 --> 00:52:40.331
Maybe it's the heavily spiked eggnog.

735
00:52:42.375 --> 00:52:44.043
I don't see why...

736
00:52:44.585 --> 00:52:47.046
<i>Maybe it was simply
a mutual desperate desire</i>


737
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.800
<i>to have ourselves
a merry little Christmas.</i>


738
00:52:50.884 --> 00:52:52.177
<i>Whatever the reason</i>

739
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.387
<i>hooking up has never gone
more swimmingly</i>


740
00:52:54.846 --> 00:53:00.143
<i>and I find myself saying something
highly out of character.</i>


741
00:53:00.394 --> 00:53:03.897
I'm renovating my apartment
on the Upper West Side.


742
00:53:05.941 --> 00:53:07.526
But, say, you could...

743
00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:12.782
crash at my sublet, if you want.

744
00:53:14.367 --> 00:53:15.785
See you through the holidays.

745
00:53:17.912 --> 00:53:19.413
That sounds inviting.

746
00:53:27.297 --> 00:53:31.509
<i>And so it came to pass,
that after all those years</i>


747
00:53:31.593 --> 00:53:35.806
<i>little Alfred finally got
what he wanted for Christmas.</i>


748
00:53:47.985 --> 00:53:50.321
<i>The 12 days of Christmas
were flying by</i>


749
00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:53.074
<i>at a surrealistic pace.</i>

750
00:53:54.825 --> 00:53:56.953
<i>Yeah, it's been quite the ride.</i>

751
00:54:01.874 --> 00:54:04.252
<i>The package was irresistible.</i>

752
00:54:04.961 --> 00:54:09.090
<i>A showstopper with
a new-school brand of sexiness.</i>


753
00:54:10.634 --> 00:54:13.387
<i>Who wouldn't get off on the way
she makes heads turn?</i>


754
00:54:14.388 --> 00:54:16.348
<i>Plus, we have so much in common.</i>

755
00:54:18.809 --> 00:54:19.935
<i>She's sweet</i>

756
00:54:20.769 --> 00:54:24.690
<i>and fun, original, exciting,
full of surprises.</i>


757
00:54:25.816 --> 00:54:28.903
<i>And did I mention,
she makes a cracking good bed?</i>


758
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.574
<i>I began to wonder</i>

759
00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:35.827
<i>could this be the one...</i>

760
00:54:38.621 --> 00:54:40.582
<i>who finally holds my attention?</i>

761
00:54:40.665 --> 00:54:42.792
- Three, two, one!
- Three, two, one!


762
00:54:42.876 --> 00:54:46.046
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!


763
00:54:58.851 --> 00:55:02.354
<i>In every doomed relationship,
there comes what I like to call</i>


764
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:06.859
<i>the "uh-oh moment."</i>

765
00:55:07.443 --> 00:55:08.986
When a certain little
something happens


766
00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:11.364
and you know you've just witnessed
the beginning of the end.


767
00:55:12.865 --> 00:55:14.701
And suddenly,
you stop and you think...


768
00:55:15.493 --> 00:55:18.621
"Uh-oh, iceberg ahead."

769
00:55:20.415 --> 00:55:21.583
Yeah.

770
00:55:21.666 --> 00:55:24.169
<i>With Nikki,
that was the first of many...</i>


771
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.047
<i>"uh-oh moments."</i>

772
00:55:27.881 --> 00:55:30.175
<i>It began with petty arguments.</i>

773
00:55:32.261 --> 00:55:35.806
<i>Followed by random bouts
of melancholia.</i>


774
00:55:37.016 --> 00:55:40.936
<i>Major highs and manic lows.</i>

775
00:55:41.562 --> 00:55:44.231
<i>This girl never knows
when she's had one too many.</i>


776
00:55:45.191 --> 00:55:49.987
<i>And there had been constant displays
of erratic, reckless behavior.</i>


777
00:55:50.238 --> 00:55:53.908
<i>And thank you, no.
No, I did not have insurance.</i>


778
00:55:56.369 --> 00:56:01.541
<i>But whenever I begin to feel
there's little reason to go on</i>


779
00:56:01.625 --> 00:56:06.046
<i>I'm reminded that we still have one
very major thing in common.</i>


780
00:56:07.172 --> 00:56:14.680
<i>If only she didn't insist on smoking
before, after and during.</i>


781
00:56:18.893 --> 00:56:21.145
What time are you gonna
be home, honey?


782
00:56:21.729 --> 00:56:24.649
Hear that? "What time are you
gonna be home, honey?"


783
00:56:25.983 --> 00:56:28.486
That's dangerously close
to wife-speak to me.


784
00:56:28.569 --> 00:56:31.489
Because I'm making something
really special for din-din.


785
00:56:32.282 --> 00:56:33.450
"Din-din"?

786
00:56:33.992 --> 00:56:35.285
I'll call later.

787
00:56:36.494 --> 00:56:40.499
Listen, are you sure you don't think
that color's a little bit intense?


788
00:56:41.792 --> 00:56:45.754
I think you're a little bit intense.

789
00:56:45.837 --> 00:56:48.215
Careful, because you've got paint
all over your hands.


790
00:56:49.216 --> 00:56:50.426
I mean...

791
00:56:50.509 --> 00:56:54.096
Plus, you're wearing my favorite
shirt to paint the house in, Nik.


792
00:56:54.388 --> 00:56:55.514
Don't...

793
00:56:58.225 --> 00:56:59.518
Sorry, baby.

794
00:57:03.439 --> 00:57:06.150
I gotta run. No, 
I've gotta run.

795
00:57:06.526 --> 00:57:10.363
I bet that I can make it
worth your while to stay.


796
00:57:11.823 --> 00:57:13.116
I'm sure you can.

797
00:57:13.199 --> 00:57:14.909
But you know what?
I've got that meeting.


798
00:57:15.327 --> 00:57:17.162
- Haven't I?
- Yeah.


799
00:57:25.546 --> 00:57:27.256
You know you're in trouble
when a sight like that


800
00:57:27.339 --> 00:57:28.799
can't keep you planted.

801
00:57:30.843 --> 00:57:34.138
When I was a boy
at St. Alban's Secondary School


802
00:57:34.221 --> 00:57:36.807
the school took us
on this cultural trip


803
00:57:37.266 --> 00:57:38.976
to observe art at one of the...

804
00:57:39.268 --> 00:57:41.521
One of those big famous
London museums.


805
00:57:42.438 --> 00:57:43.773
Anyway, when I was there

806
00:57:43.856 --> 00:57:47.110
I came across this statue
of a Greek goddess in marble.


807
00:57:47.527 --> 00:57:50.321
Aphrodi... Aphrodite,
something like that.


808
00:57:51.239 --> 00:57:52.741
Beautiful, she was.

809
00:57:54.868 --> 00:57:57.829
Perfect female form.

810
00:57:58.163 --> 00:58:01.166
Chiseled features. Exquisite.

811
00:58:03.377 --> 00:58:05.379
I stood in awe of her.

812
00:58:05.879 --> 00:58:07.506
Finally, the teacher
calls us all over


813
00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:08.799
and I'm walking past it

814
00:58:08.883 --> 00:58:13.220
and on the way, I notice,
in the side of this Greek goddess


815
00:58:13.304 --> 00:58:16.891
all these cracks, chips,
imperfections.


816
00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:19.394
Ruined her for me.

817
00:58:22.939 --> 00:58:24.566
Well, that's Nikki.

818
00:58:26.234 --> 00:58:28.361
A beautiful sculpture...

819
00:58:28.987 --> 00:58:30.363
damaged...

820
00:58:30.906 --> 00:58:33.200
in a way you don't notice
till you get too close.


821
00:58:43.794 --> 00:58:45.796
I lost the signal for a second there.

822
00:58:48.382 --> 00:58:49.842
But, I don't know.

823
00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.678
It's just a lot of personal stuff
going on.


824
00:58:53.262 --> 00:58:54.514
You know what I mean?

825
00:58:59.727 --> 00:59:01.396
- I know.
- Welcome, Mr. Alfie.


826
00:59:01.479 --> 00:59:02.522
Good to see you, Elvis.

827
00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.315
Look, I hope you don't mind me
rambling on.


828
00:59:04.399 --> 00:59:06.610
- Enjoy your evening, sir.
- Thank you.


829
00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:13.325
As you can see,
the lad's moving up in the world.


830
00:59:17.412 --> 00:59:22.001
It's just that I've got this friend
who's, let's say


831
00:59:22.793 --> 00:59:24.336
outstayed his welcome.

832
00:59:27.631 --> 00:59:28.841
Absolutely right.

833
00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:32.053
It's a lot tougher getting them out
than getting them in. I like that.


834
00:59:33.221 --> 00:59:35.932
You'll never guess
who I'm dropping in on now.


835
00:59:36.015 --> 00:59:37.934
I wouldn't have believed it myself
a couple of weeks ago.


836
00:59:38.017 --> 00:59:39.602
Why don't you just try being honest

837
00:59:39.686 --> 00:59:44.065
and tell your friend that the hotel
is under new management


838
00:59:44.149 --> 00:59:47.319
and that they have to vacate
the premises? You know what I mean.


839
00:59:48.445 --> 00:59:53.617
That kimono does wonders
for your décolletage.


840
00:59:54.535 --> 00:59:57.538
- Big word.
- Big décolletage.


841
01:00:08.591 --> 01:00:09.675
Why don't we have a drink

842
01:00:09.759 --> 01:00:11.511
and you can tell me
the rest of your troubles?


843
01:00:11.803 --> 01:00:15.098
Instead of me listening to hers.
That's a change.


844
01:00:16.307 --> 01:00:19.602
You know, for someone so very young,
you're terribly wise.


845
01:00:22.063 --> 01:00:23.273
Secret admirer?

846
01:00:24.858 --> 01:00:26.109
One of many.

847
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:31.156
You would never think of bringing
a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?


848
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.868
- It would only encourage them.
- I'm gonna make us that drink.


849
01:00:35.661 --> 01:00:37.204
What's your poison, sweetheart?

850
01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:41.208
I'll have a spot of whiskey, please.
Midleton Rare, if you've got it.


851
01:00:41.667 --> 01:00:43.878
I like dropping a fancy brand name
in now and again


852
01:00:43.961 --> 01:00:45.796
let her know she ain't
the only one been around.


853
01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.925
Why not make this
an absinthe afternoon?


854
01:00:50.176 --> 01:00:51.302
Brilliant.

855
01:00:53.346 --> 01:00:57.017
- No idea what she's talking about.
- You've had absinthe?


856
01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.061
Not recently, no.
Remind me, what is it again?


857
01:01:00.145 --> 01:01:01.438
"The Green Fairy."

858
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:05.025
The French impressionists'
liquid drug of choice.


859
01:01:05.817 --> 01:01:09.238
And I got you some of those little
egg thingies you like so much.


860
01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.291
I mention I like something once,
next thing I know


861
01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.335
I get it on a silver platter.

862
01:01:35.223 --> 01:01:36.725
Perfect, huh?

863
01:01:37.183 --> 01:01:39.352
Kind of pad I plan
to earn myself one day.


864
01:01:39.644 --> 01:01:42.773
Understated elegance
with just a touch of the trendy.


865
01:01:45.067 --> 01:01:46.944
She's a regular fashionista.

866
01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:49.655
You don't have to tell this one
which slingbacks go


867
01:01:49.738 --> 01:01:50.990
with which frock.

868
01:01:52.032 --> 01:01:54.201
Owns her own cosmetics company.

869
01:01:54.368 --> 01:01:56.537
Empire, actually.

870
01:01:57.038 --> 01:01:59.248
Started out doing facials
in a fancy salon.


871
01:01:59.332 --> 01:02:02.293
Took a handful of mud,
mixed it with a dash of papaya


872
01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.128
put it on the market, and bingo!

873
01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:06.339
All this.

874
01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:09.050
This stuff is so illegal.

875
01:02:10.635 --> 01:02:13.305
I smuggled a whole batch of it
back from Prague


876
01:02:13.388 --> 01:02:15.640
in Listerine bottles.

877
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.190
I checked out your business plan.

878
01:02:27.903 --> 01:02:29.822
- And?
- I'm impressed.


879
01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:33.117
- You seem surprised.
- Not at all.


880
01:02:33.325 --> 01:02:37.205
Because underneath all that bravado
beats the heart of a guy


881
01:02:37.288 --> 01:02:38.790
who's a lot smarter
than he thinks he is


882
01:02:38.873 --> 01:02:42.961
but not nearly as cocky as he'd like
everybody else to believe.


883
01:02:49.175 --> 01:02:50.552
What are we...

884
01:02:51.219 --> 01:02:54.264
what exactly are we basing this on?

885
01:02:55.766 --> 01:02:58.852
This insight into my personality?

886
01:03:04.525 --> 01:03:06.277
That it takes one to know one.

887
01:03:24.504 --> 01:03:25.672
What?

888
01:03:27.716 --> 01:03:28.842
I was just wondering

889
01:03:28.925 --> 01:03:30.802
if there's a clever
little tattoo artist out there


890
01:03:30.886 --> 01:03:34.264
who could change
"Pablo" into "Alfie."


891
01:03:40.688 --> 01:03:42.690
<i>Here's to clever
little tattoo artists.</i>


892
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:56.412
Jesus.

893
01:04:02.085 --> 01:04:04.212
It made me feel all warm going down.

894
01:04:05.213 --> 01:04:06.464
That's my job.

895
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.851
You know what they say.

896
01:04:20.062 --> 01:04:21.438
What do they say?

897
01:04:25.026 --> 01:04:27.737
"Absinthe makes
the heart grow fonder."


898
01:04:34.285 --> 01:04:35.787
Oh, great.

899
01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:43.336
Check this out.

900
01:04:48.383 --> 01:04:50.344
Have a look at
the size of this tub.

901
01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.388
She's had two husbands, both croaked

902
01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:55.891
and I have a feeling
this was the scene of the crime.


903
01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:58.644
Come on, baby, let's get wet.

904
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.571
If she keeps this up

905
01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.448
we're gonna be updating
that tattoo of hers


906
01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:12.242
a lot sooner than she thinks.

907
01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.255
<i>Remember how little Alfred
finally got</i>


908
01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:26.924
<i>what he wanted for Christmas?</i>

909
01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:31.595
Be careful what you wish for.

910
01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.026
<i>There's something else.</i>

911
01:05:54.369 --> 01:05:55.537
Hey.

912
01:05:57.956 --> 01:05:59.207
Dozed off?

913
01:06:01.543 --> 01:06:02.669
Yeah.

914
01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:06.507
I tried waiting up for you.

915
01:06:09.051 --> 01:06:10.594
God. Your meeting ran late?

916
01:06:10.678 --> 01:06:14.390
Very. I'm knackered. And wet.

917
01:06:16.684 --> 01:06:17.810
But...

918
01:06:19.186 --> 01:06:23.441
I do want us to have
a little chat, Nikki.


919
01:06:26.486 --> 01:06:27.612
Okay.

920
01:06:28.488 --> 01:06:29.572
Sure.

921
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:32.993
Why don't we talk
over a midnight snack?


922
01:06:33.618 --> 01:06:37.164
I made roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding.


923
01:06:37.831 --> 01:06:40.167
That was your favorite
as a young lad, right?


924
01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:44.213
And check the place out,
if you please.


925
01:06:45.756 --> 01:06:48.175
Your little girl
worked her fanny off.


926
01:06:48.258 --> 01:06:49.927
I noticed. It looks brilliant.

927
01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.596
Really smashing.

928
01:06:54.265 --> 01:06:56.100
- So, Nik...
- Alfie, I've been thinking.


929
01:06:58.561 --> 01:07:00.980
Will you look at these cute
little potatoes?


930
01:07:05.652 --> 01:07:09.906
Okay. I know I have been
a real handful lately.


931
01:07:11.533 --> 01:07:15.078
I don't know, I think it has to do
a lot with me feeling displaced...


932
01:07:17.122 --> 01:07:19.207
and not totally trusting.

933
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.003
Sweetie, cutting to the chase.

934
01:07:24.254 --> 01:07:27.258
I am gonna do better.

935
01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:29.844
I promise.

936
01:07:30.594 --> 01:07:34.140
I am gonna take my medication
religiously from now on.


937
01:07:34.223 --> 01:07:35.349
And everything...

938
01:07:35.808 --> 01:07:38.394
everything is gonna be easy
and breezy.


939
01:07:38.478 --> 01:07:40.063
Sound good? Honey?

940
01:07:41.105 --> 01:07:43.858
So come and sit. 
A feast awaits.

941
01:07:45.402 --> 01:07:46.861
I already ate, Nik.

942
01:07:48.655 --> 01:07:52.200
Of course.
No worries, we'll have leftovers.


943
01:07:52.451 --> 01:07:55.829
I can whip up a little
corned beef hash for brunch.


944
01:08:04.296 --> 01:08:05.714
What's the matter, Alfie?

945
01:08:06.841 --> 01:08:08.634
Nothing. I just...

946
01:08:11.095 --> 01:08:12.972
I've got a lot on my mind and...

947
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.892
- I'm feeling a bit...
- What?


948
01:08:18.102 --> 01:08:21.231
Cold? Distant? Remote? What?

949
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:25.277
Nik, this is a complete drag.

950
01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:29.614
Everything happened so quickly.

951
01:08:31.533 --> 01:08:32.868
I'm not the best
at this sort of thing.


952
01:08:32.951 --> 01:08:34.286
What sort of thing?

953
01:08:37.456 --> 01:08:41.418
I don't know exactly how to say it.

954
01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:44.046
Sure you do, Alfie.

955
01:08:47.133 --> 01:08:49.969
You've had plenty of experience
dumping girls.


956
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:09.197
Don't worry.

957
01:09:10.782 --> 01:09:12.159
I'm already gone.

958
01:10:11.304 --> 01:10:12.597
<i>Strange.</i>

959
01:10:13.765 --> 01:10:15.934
<i>But even when you know
it has to end...</i>


960
01:10:17.227 --> 01:10:18.854
<i>when it finally does...</i>

961
01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:22.858
<i>you always get
that inevitable twinge...</i>


962
01:10:24.359 --> 01:10:25.944
<i>"Have I done the right thing?"</i>

963
01:10:36.247 --> 01:10:37.373
I must admit...

964
01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:40.960
I do miss the companionship.

965
01:10:44.839 --> 01:10:47.592
Nikki was a showstopper.

966
01:10:50.094 --> 01:10:53.556
But as me ugly old Aunt Gladys
used to say


967
01:10:56.226 --> 01:10:57.686
"Looks aren't everything."

968
01:10:57.769 --> 01:10:59.688
I used to think that was
a load of bollocks, but...


969
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:02.274
just lately I've been thinking...

970
01:11:04.234 --> 01:11:06.028
maybe the old bat had something.

971
01:11:48.906 --> 01:11:49.949
Julie?

972
01:11:51.951 --> 01:11:53.285
Alfie, hi.

973
01:11:53.953 --> 01:11:54.996
What a surprise.

974
01:11:55.872 --> 01:11:58.291
God, I haven't seen you since...

975
01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:00.126
Yeah.

976
01:12:00.668 --> 01:12:03.046
You look... you look amazing.

977
01:12:03.129 --> 01:12:05.089
Thanks. You too. 
You look good too.

978
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.093
Yeah. I'm getting over a cold.

979
01:12:09.344 --> 01:12:12.097
- But you're okay otherwise?
- I'm fine. I'm always fine.


980
01:12:12.472 --> 01:12:13.515
Yeah.

981
01:12:16.184 --> 01:12:17.686
It's good to see you.

982
01:12:19.104 --> 01:12:20.189
And you.

983
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:28.114
Hey, you know, I was...

984
01:12:30.658 --> 01:12:32.660
I'm sorry about what happened
between us.


985
01:12:34.328 --> 01:12:36.914
And I'm sorry how it all ended up.

986
01:12:36.998 --> 01:12:39.250
It wasn't... it wasn't good.

987
01:12:44.339 --> 01:12:49.010
I felt bad about not seeing Max
and about not seeing you.


988
01:12:53.682 --> 01:12:56.310
- It's water under the bridge.
- Good.


989
01:12:59.772 --> 01:13:00.981
You know...

990
01:13:02.775 --> 01:13:03.943
I'm wondering.

991
01:13:09.323 --> 01:13:10.533
Maybe we...

992
01:13:11.659 --> 01:13:13.619
You know I can never
promise anything.


993
01:13:15.747 --> 01:13:19.584
But if you want, if you like,
maybe we could see each other again.


994
01:13:20.126 --> 01:13:21.961
It would be okay by me.

995
01:13:22.045 --> 01:13:25.090
It would be more than okay,
it would be... it would be great.


996
01:13:25.173 --> 01:13:27.509
- Alfie, I...
- Yeah?


997
01:13:28.969 --> 01:13:30.262
This is Adam.

998
01:13:34.057 --> 01:13:35.225
Hey, how are you?

999
01:13:36.602 --> 01:13:38.437
- Hey, how you doing, Adam?
- Pretty good.


1000
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.897
- Adam.
- Yeah.


1001
01:13:46.529 --> 01:13:48.156
It was great running into you.

1002
01:13:50.742 --> 01:13:52.035
You look fantastic.

1003
01:13:52.285 --> 01:13:53.494
Thanks.

1004
01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.084
What time is it? 
I've gotta go.

1005
01:14:00.377 --> 01:14:02.712
I'm late for a meeting.
Nice to meet you, Adam.


1006
01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:14.975
Julie?

1007
01:14:17.394 --> 01:14:18.479
How's Max?

1008
01:14:19.271 --> 01:14:20.398
Really good.

1009
01:14:21.148 --> 01:14:24.068
- Will you say hi?
- Sure.


1010
01:14:25.278 --> 01:14:26.362
Or not.

1011
01:14:28.156 --> 01:14:29.282
Be well.

1012
01:15:16.915 --> 01:15:17.999
Hello.

1013
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:22.421
Hello.

1014
01:15:28.344 --> 01:15:29.678
Mrs. Wing, is everything...

1015
01:15:31.138 --> 01:15:32.181
Wing.

1016
01:15:35.393 --> 01:15:36.477
Why are you crying?

1017
01:15:37.395 --> 01:15:39.188
I'm not crying. Get out.

1018
01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:42.984
- You sure?
- I'm fine. Get out, Alfie.


1019
01:15:43.067 --> 01:15:46.529
I'm sorry. I just... I wanted to see
if I could borrow a car.


1020
01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:48.865
She leave me.

1021
01:15:49.908 --> 01:15:51.034
Sorry?

1022
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.497
- Blossom leave me.
- Blossom?


1023
01:15:56.998 --> 01:15:58.375
Is that your wife's name, Blossom?

1024
01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:02.880
What I do wrong, Alfie? Love her?

1025
01:16:04.923 --> 01:16:06.258
Hey, look, mate.

1026
01:16:07.092 --> 01:16:09.970
Come on, you can win her back.
Woo her.


1027
01:16:10.054 --> 01:16:13.724
Send flowers and chocolates.
Write a poem.


1028
01:16:14.684 --> 01:16:15.893
That what you do?

1029
01:16:15.977 --> 01:16:17.436
Well, actually, no,
I've never done that


1030
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.356
but it... may be a way to go.

1031
01:16:22.483 --> 01:16:24.611
What rhyme with Blossom?

1032
01:16:26.154 --> 01:16:29.866
I would try... "awesome."

1033
01:16:34.913 --> 01:16:35.998
Okay.

1034
01:17:35.101 --> 01:17:36.686
You never cease to amaze.

1035
01:17:38.146 --> 01:17:39.189
Hey.

1036
01:17:41.066 --> 01:17:42.400
Great to see you too, Lon.

1037
01:17:44.736 --> 01:17:46.154
I guess I should have rung.

1038
01:17:47.072 --> 01:17:48.240
Hey, Sam.

1039
01:17:48.323 --> 01:17:49.491
Well, that would have been a plan.

1040
01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:53.620
Well, you know, I'm sorry,
it was just...


1041
01:17:55.622 --> 01:17:56.832
It's nice.

1042
01:18:06.384 --> 01:18:08.553
Look, Lonette...

1043
01:18:11.097 --> 01:18:13.725
This is so uncomfortable, I know.

1044
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:15.685
- Because...
- You don't have to whisper.


1045
01:18:16.102 --> 01:18:17.604
Marlon's not here.

1046
01:18:24.778 --> 01:18:26.279
I really miss you both.

1047
01:18:26.655 --> 01:18:28.573
And I just wondered, maybe...

1048
01:18:30.242 --> 01:18:32.327
Maybe me and you
could put it all behind us


1049
01:18:32.536 --> 01:18:36.457
pretend like it never happened,
and then move forward, you know?


1050
01:18:37.583 --> 01:18:38.709
I just...

1051
01:18:40.461 --> 01:18:42.296
You know, Alfie...

1052
01:18:43.923 --> 01:18:45.925
dropping by wasn't a good idea.

1053
01:18:54.225 --> 01:18:56.227
You two didn't have a baby.

1054
01:18:59.272 --> 01:19:00.732
You did have a baby.

1055
01:19:02.317 --> 01:19:04.945
No, you were right the first time.

1056
01:19:33.892 --> 01:19:36.061
<i>Thinking back to that day
at the clinic</i>


1057
01:19:36.144 --> 01:19:39.564
<i>I remember trying to look
in Lon's eyes to see</i>


1058
01:19:39.648 --> 01:19:42.192
<i>if I could even begin to understand
what she was going through</i>


1059
01:19:43.235 --> 01:19:45.737
<i>and how she wouldn't look at me.</i>

1060
01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:47.990
<i>And I think I knew then.</i>

1061
01:19:49.158 --> 01:19:51.118
<i>I just didn't want
to admit it to myself.</i>


1062
01:19:54.163 --> 01:19:55.456
<i>So classically...</i>

1063
01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.127
<i>I said nothing.</i>

1064
01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:06.593
I knew there was a good chance
the baby could be Marlon's.


1065
01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.015
At least, I hoped.

1066
01:20:14.726 --> 01:20:16.102
This is a lot...

1067
01:20:19.272 --> 01:20:20.607
for me too, Lon.

1068
01:20:50.263 --> 01:20:51.556
Marlon stayed.

1069
01:20:52.724 --> 01:20:53.892
For now.

1070
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:04.737
Is there anything I can do?

1071
01:21:07.156 --> 01:21:08.908
What are you gonna do, Alfie?

1072
01:21:51.619 --> 01:21:52.662
Hey.

1073
01:21:58.835 --> 01:22:01.379
You know, I never...

1074
01:22:03.214 --> 01:22:05.383
- I never meant...
- You never mean to hurt anybody.


1075
01:22:10.889 --> 01:22:12.140
But you do, Alfie.

1076
01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:46.656
<i>I felt I needed
a friend to talk to.</i>

1077
01:23:47.407 --> 01:23:50.493
<i>Problem was,
they were suddenly in short supply.</i>


1078
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.913
And I don't... I don't remember
being in the car.


1079
01:23:53.997 --> 01:23:55.832
I just... I was stopped.

1080
01:23:56.791 --> 01:23:58.126
And I'm crying.

1081
01:23:58.627 --> 01:24:01.838
- Crying for the little one?
- I don't know exactly.


1082
01:24:04.091 --> 01:24:05.259
Maybe for him.

1083
01:24:07.553 --> 01:24:09.054
Mostly, I think, for me.

1084
01:24:11.807 --> 01:24:13.100
And Marlon.

1085
01:24:15.394 --> 01:24:18.105
I never had anybody look at me
quite like that before.


1086
01:24:21.192 --> 01:24:24.570
And believe me,
I've had some looks that could kill.


1087
01:24:27.824 --> 01:24:32.328
He stood by Lonette.
I could've never, ever...


1088
01:24:32.787 --> 01:24:35.498
You don't know what you'll do
till you really love someone.


1089
01:24:39.544 --> 01:24:40.754
Well, now what?

1090
01:24:42.422 --> 01:24:44.925
You gonna shoehorn yourself
into the situation?


1091
01:24:45.008 --> 01:24:46.135
No.

1092
01:24:46.552 --> 01:24:50.222
You did the only thing you could do.
You behaved like a gentleman.


1093
01:24:50.598 --> 01:24:52.433
I've never been accused
of that before.


1094
01:24:52.933 --> 01:24:54.602
Don't get all choked up.

1095
01:24:55.102 --> 01:24:57.146
You also behaved like a scheming,
backstabbing


1096
01:24:57.230 --> 01:25:00.358
so-low-you-can-look-up-
a-snake's-asshole son of a bitch.


1097
01:25:00.817 --> 01:25:03.778
Next time, think before unzipping.

1098
01:25:06.447 --> 01:25:09.284
It's all right. 
You screwed up.

1099
01:25:10.201 --> 01:25:11.620
So, what are you gonna do?

1100
01:25:12.829 --> 01:25:14.164
Run to the bridge?

1101
01:25:15.957 --> 01:25:17.250
The question is...

1102
01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.673
what's gonna happen
with the rest of your life?


1103
01:25:50.952 --> 01:25:53.747
I'd be lying if I didn't admit
the events of the past few weeks


1104
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:55.582
have knocked me for
a bit of a loop.

1105
01:26:03.549 --> 01:26:05.217
All right...

1106
01:26:16.854 --> 01:26:18.064
Hello, mate.

1107
01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.441
And what can we do
for you this evening?


1108
01:26:20.525 --> 01:26:22.026
- How much are one of those?
- Five-fifty.


1109
01:26:22.402 --> 01:26:25.113
And you'll need to put them
in water immediately.


1110
01:26:25.196 --> 01:26:26.489
Right, I'll have that.

1111
01:26:32.454 --> 01:26:33.872
Second thought.

1112
01:26:34.206 --> 01:26:36.708
Actually, this is...
this is sort of a special thing.


1113
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:39.878
- What's the occasion?
- Say again?


1114
01:26:39.962 --> 01:26:41.297
Proposal?

1115
01:26:41.881 --> 01:26:43.757
No...

1116
01:26:45.885 --> 01:26:51.349
Well, I do want to extend an offer
to maybe have a go at it for a bit


1117
01:26:51.432 --> 01:26:53.434
give us a spin, that kind of thing.

1118
01:26:53.518 --> 01:26:56.145
I get it. Commitment issues.

1119
01:26:57.814 --> 01:27:00.900
Tell me what she, or he, is like

1120
01:27:01.401 --> 01:27:03.361
and we'll find the appropriate bloom.

1121
01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:05.989
Well, she is...

1122
01:27:10.494 --> 01:27:13.747
You know what, she's adventurous.

1123
01:27:16.083 --> 01:27:19.461
<i>- Frivole.</i>
- And very sexy.


1124
01:27:21.505 --> 01:27:23.382
I'm thinking Dolce Vita.

1125
01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:27.637
A little mischievous.
You know, cheeky?


1126
01:27:27.970 --> 01:27:34.143
Avalanche, with a touch of <i>mi amore.</i>

1127
01:27:35.812 --> 01:27:38.356
And then under it all, she's just...

1128
01:27:39.607 --> 01:27:42.694
She's just kind of... sweet.

1129
01:28:08.179 --> 01:28:09.263
Liz?

1130
01:28:09.889 --> 01:28:11.099
Hello?

1131
01:28:11.432 --> 01:28:12.600
It's me, my love.

1132
01:28:15.145 --> 01:28:16.187
- Hey.
- Hey.


1133
01:28:16.271 --> 01:28:17.522
I didn't expect to see you tonight.

1134
01:28:17.606 --> 01:28:19.316
I thought you were working.

1135
01:28:19.399 --> 01:28:22.319
I had a cancellation,
so I took the night off.


1136
01:28:22.402 --> 01:28:24.363
Listen, I thought we should
get up early


1137
01:28:24.446 --> 01:28:25.906
get out of the city,
go to the country


1138
01:28:25.989 --> 01:28:28.909
and see if we can stay at
that B and B you're always on about.


1139
01:28:28.992 --> 01:28:30.244
Honey, I'd love to, but I can't.

1140
01:28:30.327 --> 01:28:32.121
I have an investors' breakfast
in the morning.


1141
01:28:32.204 --> 01:28:33.998
- How about on the weekend?
- Brilliant.


1142
01:28:34.081 --> 01:28:35.291
- Yeah.
- Better.


1143
01:28:35.666 --> 01:28:37.251
All right. I thought you may...

1144
01:28:39.086 --> 01:28:41.255
Oh, my God.

1145
01:28:42.799 --> 01:28:45.301
No. Alfie.

1146
01:28:46.177 --> 01:28:49.180
- What a sweet gesture.
- Milady.


1147
01:28:50.974 --> 01:28:52.809
They're not out
of some plastic bucket.


1148
01:28:52.892 --> 01:28:55.145
- No.
- I handpicked, like, every bud.


1149
01:28:55.228 --> 01:28:56.771
I can see that.

1150
01:28:56.855 --> 01:28:59.900
And apparently, I have a bit
of a flair for flower arranging.


1151
01:29:00.734 --> 01:29:02.069
I'm impressed.

1152
01:29:03.362 --> 01:29:06.365
- Talk about being blown away.
- Good. Mission accomplished.


1153
01:29:08.951 --> 01:29:10.452
I like surprising you.

1154
01:29:12.454 --> 01:29:14.373
Well, you certainly have done that.

1155
01:29:16.167 --> 01:29:17.418
All right, then.

1156
01:29:17.793 --> 01:29:20.379
Well, you're up early, so I'm off.

1157
01:29:20.463 --> 01:29:22.131
Okay. Well, I'm gonna see you
tomorrow night? All right?


1158
01:29:22.215 --> 01:29:23.257
Yeah.

1159
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.678
When we speak, there's some things...

1160
01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.723
well, some thing
I really wanna talk to you about.


1161
01:29:30.015 --> 01:29:31.224
What, honey?

1162
01:29:32.183 --> 01:29:34.352
I'm gonna wait
for the exact perfect moment


1163
01:29:34.603 --> 01:29:36.897
and that's all I'll say.

1164
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:40.567
I'll ring you in the morning.

1165
01:29:41.068 --> 01:29:43.028
And, Alfie,
thank you for the flowers. Really.


1166
01:29:43.112 --> 01:29:44.697
- They made my evening.
- Really?


1167
01:29:47.533 --> 01:29:50.995
In that case, maybe I'll stay.

1168
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.251
I don't...

1169
01:29:59.837 --> 01:30:01.422
No, it's not a good idea.

1170
01:30:07.178 --> 01:30:09.014
There's a guy in there, isn't there?

1171
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:14.519
God...

1172
01:30:23.487 --> 01:30:24.572
Go.

1173
01:30:29.994 --> 01:30:31.329
Don't do this.

1174
01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:37.960
What's he got?

1175
01:30:40.046 --> 01:30:41.172
Better than me?

1176
01:30:41.464 --> 01:30:42.549
Alfie, please.

1177
01:30:42.632 --> 01:30:44.759
Tell me. Please?

1178
01:30:47.971 --> 01:30:51.016
Really, I would like to know.
What's he got? Tell me.


1179
01:30:52.434 --> 01:30:55.395
I want to know what he's got.
Please tell me.


1180
01:30:56.772 --> 01:30:58.440
Come on...

1181
01:30:59.024 --> 01:31:02.319
Come on, just tell me.
Just tell me, come on.


1182
01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:06.407
What's he got better than me?

1183
01:31:16.542 --> 01:31:18.127
He's younger than you.

1184
01:31:46.782 --> 01:31:48.284
<i>"He's younger than you."</i>

1185
01:31:50.995 --> 01:31:53.456
<i>I've gotta admit,
I didn't see it coming.</i>


1186
01:31:56.084 --> 01:31:57.919
<i>She caught me off-guard, all right.</i>

1187
01:32:00.797 --> 01:32:03.675
You couldn't tell, though, could you?

1188
01:32:06.845 --> 01:32:08.305
As you've learned by now

1189
01:32:08.388 --> 01:32:11.809
I'm rather skilled
at hiding my feelings.


1190
01:32:17.022 --> 01:32:20.901
You see, the thing with feelings
is they have this quiet way


1191
01:32:20.985 --> 01:32:23.070
of sneaking up on you
when you least expect it.


1192
01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.492
You know what I mean?

1193
01:32:28.701 --> 01:32:29.786
Yeah.

1194
01:32:31.829 --> 01:32:33.122
Like with Liz.

1195
01:32:34.165 --> 01:32:37.377
Who would've thought,
of all the women I've known...


1196
01:32:40.589 --> 01:32:43.508
the one I let my guard down with
delivers the knockout punch.


1197
01:32:47.304 --> 01:32:48.347
Ironic.

1198
01:32:51.642 --> 01:32:53.060
Calendar word.

1199
01:33:02.195 --> 01:33:03.362
Dorie.

1200
01:33:07.909 --> 01:33:09.619
- Hi.
- Hello, Alfie.


1201
01:33:12.914 --> 01:33:16.418
- I haven't seen you in ages.
- Maybe because you stopped calling.


1202
01:33:17.961 --> 01:33:20.881
I know.
Things were getting a bit too...


1203
01:33:20.964 --> 01:33:23.592
Don't bother explaining.
I'm way past needing excuses.


1204
01:33:23.842 --> 01:33:24.968
All right.

1205
01:33:25.886 --> 01:33:27.930
No, you know what? 
I want to explain.

1206
01:33:28.013 --> 01:33:30.224
What? You had your fill of me?

1207
01:33:30.516 --> 01:33:33.727
Someone cuter came along?
I don't need to hear it, Alfie.


1208
01:33:33.811 --> 01:33:34.895
- Look, Dorie...
- Really.


1209
01:33:34.979 --> 01:33:36.147
Look, Dorie...

1210
01:33:39.442 --> 01:33:41.068
What happens with me is...

1211
01:33:42.153 --> 01:33:45.698
I don't know, I get...
when it gets too...


1212
01:33:45.782 --> 01:33:50.120
not close, but something like that,
I start to feel...


1213
01:33:51.413 --> 01:33:54.875
not stifled, not trapped

1214
01:33:54.958 --> 01:33:57.919
but something like that.

1215
01:33:58.003 --> 01:33:59.838
And I... and...

1216
01:34:01.965 --> 01:34:03.634
You know? You know what I mean?

1217
01:34:07.846 --> 01:34:09.974
Did that make...
did that make any sense?


1218
01:34:11.934 --> 01:34:14.937
I think it has to make sense to you
more than me at this point.


1219
01:34:18.191 --> 01:34:19.442
Yeah, fair enough.

1220
01:34:20.234 --> 01:34:22.362
I need to go.
He'll be waiting for me.


1221
01:34:23.404 --> 01:34:24.531
Dorie.

1222
01:34:30.495 --> 01:34:31.705
I'm sorry.

1223
01:34:48.472 --> 01:34:49.724
Good luck, Alfie.

1224
01:35:06.992 --> 01:35:08.743
I warned them all from the beginning.

1225
01:35:09.536 --> 01:35:12.247
I always said something
along the lines of


1226
01:35:13.498 --> 01:35:15.584
"I must advise you

1227
01:35:15.667 --> 01:35:19.338
I am stamped
with an invisible warning.


1228
01:35:20.172 --> 01:35:23.676
I will not commit.
I will never marry."


1229
01:35:31.517 --> 01:35:32.560
Despite my best efforts

1230
01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:34.729
I'm beginning to feel
some small cracks


1231
01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:39.526
in my faux finish.

1232
01:35:42.195 --> 01:35:45.031
<i>You know, when I look back
on my little life</i>


1233
01:35:45.574 --> 01:35:47.200
<i>and all the women I've known...</i>

1234
01:35:49.953 --> 01:35:51.705
<i>I can't help but think about...</i>

1235
01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:56.627
<i>all that they've done for me.</i>

1236
01:35:58.504 --> 01:36:00.214
<i>And how little I've done for them.</i>

1237
01:36:01.382 --> 01:36:03.968
<i>How they looked after me,
cared for me...</i>


1238
01:36:05.636 --> 01:36:08.222
<i>and I repaid them
by never returning the favor.</i>


1239
01:36:11.601 --> 01:36:12.769
Yeah.

1240
01:36:13.519 --> 01:36:15.688
I used to think I had
the best end of the deal.


1241
01:36:21.319 --> 01:36:22.654
What have I got?

1242
01:36:23.655 --> 01:36:24.698
Really?

1243
01:36:26.867 --> 01:36:31.455
Some money in my pocket.
Some nice threads.


1244
01:36:31.538 --> 01:36:35.125
Fancy car at my disposal.
And I'm single.


1245
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:37.711
Yeah.

1246
01:36:39.213 --> 01:36:41.966
Unattached. Free as a bird.

1247
01:36:45.386 --> 01:36:47.138
I don't depend on nobody.

1248
01:36:48.014 --> 01:36:49.640
Nobody depends on me.

1249
01:36:51.267 --> 01:36:52.644
My life's my own.

1250
01:36:59.776 --> 01:37:01.486
But I don't have peace of mind.

1251
01:37:09.536 --> 01:37:11.455
And if you don't have that,
you've got nothing.


1252
01:37:15.459 --> 01:37:16.585
So...

1253
01:37:18.546 --> 01:37:21.382
So, what's the answer?
That's what I keep asking myself.


1254
01:37:26.971 --> 01:37:28.431
What's it all about?

1255
01:37:31.309 --> 01:37:32.393
You know what I mean?

1256
01:37:34.504 --> 01:37:42.846
