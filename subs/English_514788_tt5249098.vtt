I am from Tennessee.


15
00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:06.697
For a lot of Southern families,

16
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.396
it's really big that girls
get married or have a family.

[Julie Atlas Muz]
Everyone can do it.


23
00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.047
Everyone can perform burlesque
if they really want to.


24
00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:21.919
You need to get a costume,
you need to get a gimmick,


25
00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:24.399
and you need to get up onstage
and have the balls to do it.

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.017
[cheers and applause]

27
00:03:34.453 --> 00:03:40.502
I was asked, I believe,
in 1996 or 1997,


28
00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:42.461
by Catherine Hourihan,

29
00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:44.332
she said, "Will you do
a burlesque number for me?"


30
00:03:44.376 --> 00:03:46.247
And I had no idea
what it was.


31
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:48.075
She said,
"It's a short dance


32
00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.035
that either begins or ends naked
to music."


33
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:55.300
You know, at that time
you could fit


34
00:03:55.343 --> 00:03:57.650
all of the burlesque performers
in New York City in two cabs.


35
00:03:57.694 --> 00:03:59.957
I remember when it was still
just like me,


36
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.960
Scotty the Blue Bunny,
Dirty Martini,


37
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:05.876
Velocity Chyaldd, Tigger,

38
00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.704
and World Famous Bob,
and just like a handful


39
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:11.055
of the first wave
of what we considered to be


40
00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:14.972
the initial waves of
the burlesque revival movement
in New York City.


41
00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:18.410
Experimental artists that were
just absolutely whack-a-doodle


42
00:04:18.453 --> 00:04:22.719
and inspiring and think outside
any concept of any shape.

43
00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.416
Think outside the triangle.

44
00:04:26.723 --> 00:04:28.289
When I started doing burlesque,

45
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:30.727
nobody knew what the word
"burlesque" was.


46
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.599
I didn't even care what
the word "burlesque" meant.


47
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:36.428
But then it sort of like
snowballed.


48
00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:40.693
You know, there's that
second wave


49
00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:45.611
Then there's the third wave.
Then there's the fourth wave.


50
00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:49.267
And then Christina Aguilera
and Cher.


51
00:04:50.877 --> 00:04:52.531
And then there's
the seventh wave.


52
00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:56.491
Burlesque is an evolving term,

53
00:04:56.535 --> 00:05:01.453
which includes an aesthetic
of sparkles and eyelashes


54
00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:05.152
and high heels
and fancy dresses and nudity.


55
00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:07.720
And femininity.

56
00:05:07.764 --> 00:05:10.070
And comedy.

57
00:05:10.114 --> 00:05:12.333
It's also now becoming
more and more a lifestyle.


58
00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:19.514
But burlesque has always been,
and I believe will always be,


59
00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:22.474
the lowest of the low
entertainment.


60
00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:26.217
Because, really,
who are we?


61
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.523
Just some stripper
from New York City.


62
00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:30.569
[laughs]

63
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.101
I always knew
I wanted to live here.


64
00:05:41.145 --> 00:05:43.321
Even when I was young
and had no concept


65
00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:46.106
of what it really meant.

66
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.241
I felt really weird
where I was from.


67
00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:51.677
I don't know,
it just never felt like


68
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:53.679
the right fit back there.

69
00:05:57.204 --> 00:06:02.340
My mother always said I was an
old woman born in a tiny body.


70
00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:07.780
And from the very beginning,
a smartass who talked too much,

71
00:06:07.824 --> 00:06:12.567
and just a little too wise

72
00:06:12.611 --> 00:06:14.961
for such a small person.

73
00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:18.051
And she has great stories
of where I would,


74
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.923
even as a 7-year-old,

75
00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:21.838
just be breaking the balls
of all of her friends.


76
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.232
And she said, you would
make them feel bad about themselves.

77
00:06:25.276 --> 00:06:28.888
My mother was
a construction worker.


78
00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:31.804
Sometimes for fun she would
take me on site with her,


79
00:06:31.848 --> 00:06:34.241
and I always liked that time
with her.


80
00:06:34.285 --> 00:06:38.332
Now she is a motorcycle
mechanic.


81
00:06:38.376 --> 00:06:42.293
My father is a contractor
and does like electric work


82
00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:45.296
and stuff like that, but I
did not grow up with him.

83
00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.167
He left when I was a baby.

84
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:48.995
But we've always had a good,
friendly relationship.


85
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.477
He knows what I do.
He doesn't care.


86
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.349
When you're in a family
where your mom is a biker,


87
00:06:55.393 --> 00:06:59.092

for about six years.

92

I've got it good.

93
00:07:12.802 --> 00:07:15.108
I live in New York
and I'm able


94
00:07:15.152 --> 00:07:16.718
to maybe sometimes
barely scrape by,


95
00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:18.895

to support myself.

a sloppy person,

have like a sexy connotation.

We had these suitcases
just full of random clothes.

And then we just
put them on.

Before I got into burlesque,


150
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.713
I was really on this very deep
Jewish journey.


151
00:10:48.756 --> 00:10:52.760
I got my master's
in Jewish Education.


152
00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:55.328
In graduate school I felt very,
very out of place.


153
00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:58.027
It was very stifling
and conservative for me.


154
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.421
I didn't kind of fit
the typical mold


155
00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:06.296

exposed to it more and more.

clipboard and he says,

"Mel, you have to stop
masturbating."


327
00:21:26.524 --> 00:21:29.570

to stop masturbating?

I mean, that's ridiculous."

[James Habacker]
When I first opened
the Slipper Room downtown,


334
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.373
it was very much
an artistic center.


335
00:21:49.416 --> 00:21:51.897
You know, a lot of small
experimental theaters


336
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:54.508
run by people who were
interested in art,


337
00:21:54.552 --> 00:21:56.859
and supporting the arts.

338
00:21:56.902 --> 00:21:58.208
They're all gone now.

339
00:21:58.251 --> 00:21:59.688
We're the last
of the theaters


340
00:21:59.731 --> 00:22:01.690
on the Lower East Side.

341
00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:04.954
I think that New York
is much more money-oriented


342
00:22:04.997 --> 00:22:06.999
than it is arts-oriented.

343
00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:08.958
One of the things, I think,
that makes the Slipper Room


344
00:22:09.001 --> 00:22:11.221
kind of unique is that
it is run by people


345
00:22:11.264 --> 00:22:14.659
who are in it as an art project
first and foremost.


346
00:22:14.703 --> 00:22:17.401
One of the things
that really cemented it


347
00:22:17.444 --> 00:22:19.490
as the Slipper Room style

348
00:22:19.533 --> 00:22:21.405
was that you have a host
who's a comedian


349
00:22:21.448 --> 00:22:23.363
who's playing a character,

350
00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:26.584
you know who's doing like
an old-style variety show,


351
00:22:26.627 --> 00:22:28.499
like the kind of thing
you might have seen,


352
00:22:28.542 --> 00:22:31.284

on 1950s television.

355
00:22:39.075 --> 00:22:40.685
We book variety shows,

356
00:22:40.729 --> 00:22:42.469
and I consider the burlesque
side of it


357
00:22:42.513 --> 00:22:44.733
to be strip tease.

358
00:22:44.776 --> 00:22:47.300
And not just
any strip tease.


359
00:22:47.344 --> 00:22:49.999
There's a distinction
between the stripper


360
00:22:50.042 --> 00:22:51.522
and the burlesque dancer.

361
00:22:53.306 --> 00:22:56.657
Burlesque itself as an
art form is, you know,

362
00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:58.703
hundreds of years older
than strip tease.


363
00:22:58.747 --> 00:23:00.792
And it's political parody.

364
00:23:00.836 --> 00:23:06.232
It's holding a mirror up
to our society and saying,


365
00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:08.757
look how ridiculous this is.

366
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.457
It forces people to think
about how repressed their lives are.

367
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.026
We get a lot of really square
people come in here,


368
00:23:17.069 --> 00:23:18.810
and they see these people
who are on stage


369
00:23:18.854 --> 00:23:21.204
who are completely free.

370
00:23:21.247 --> 00:23:23.815
And it's in a direct line
from you know, Warhol's Factory.


371
00:23:23.859 --> 00:23:27.036
Like what, you know, came out
of New York in the '60s.


372
00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:31.257
There are still a fair amount
of people who come to New York


373
00:23:31.301 --> 00:23:32.911
because they're attracted
to that.


374
00:23:34.043 --> 00:23:35.871
'Cause they know about that.

375

then they have a home.

about networking

where they announce

But it's actually
an opportunity

I was looking
through a magazine

the more enchanted I was
with her story,

to make it highbrow,


770
00:45:35.058 --> 00:45:36.146
or trying to make it

771
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.148
only for people with money,

772
00:45:38.192 --> 00:45:40.890
or only for people who want
to look at skinny people,

or one body type.

00:45:43.327 --> 00:45:45.286
And the people that are
kind of buying into that,

00:45:45.329 --> 00:45:49.116
it's not coming from a place
of soul or heart.

Today, I signed a contract


780
00:46:10.224 --> 00:46:13.140
to perform in Atlantic City
this summer.


781
00:46:13.183 --> 00:46:16.360
I'm going to be doing shows
once a week


782
00:46:16.404 --> 00:46:18.188
at the Borgata Casino.

783
00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:24.151
I never thought that I
would be in this situation:

784
00:46:24.194 --> 00:46:29.504
more work than I need, and
being in demand as a performer.

785
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.203
It's like a dream come true,

786
00:46:33.247 --> 00:46:34.900
except that I never actually
had this dream,


787
00:46:34.944 --> 00:46:37.425
because I didn't know
that it was a possibility.


788
00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:42.647
Even a couple years ago,
I would say


789
00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:44.432
I'm not going to be performing
all the time.


790
00:46:44.475 --> 00:46:47.261
I'm just going to be performing for fun.

791
00:46:49.698 --> 00:46:51.526
But now I'm performing
all the time,


792
00:46:51.569 --> 00:46:54.311
and I travel, and...

793
00:46:56.444 --> 00:46:57.880
the casino
really spoils me.

[Minnie]
Quite frankly,


796
00:47:02.537 --> 00:47:05.192
burlesque does not
pay the bills,


797
00:47:05.235 --> 00:47:07.150
and my rent
is really expensive.


798
00:47:07.194 --> 00:47:10.588
And so I, um...

799
00:47:11.937 --> 00:47:14.244
I need to figure
something else out


800

in terms of my income.

As the New York Burlesque
Festival was coming up,


853
00:51:44.775 --> 00:51:48.213
I was so nervous
for this act.


854

I was all stressed out
about it because I was like,

is this going to work,

For me, I'm not that quick
to make a new act.

sometimes it's just like
the inspiration

to do that
just isn't there.

So now you have to start
asking yourself, you know,


874
00:53:02.723 --> 00:53:06.291
"What am I getting out of this? What are they getting
out of this?"

when they don't feel confident.

You know, it's hard.

Especially when you're a naked
lady on stage, you know,

00:53:26.181 --> 00:53:28.618
there's a lot of things
going through your head.


879
00:53:28.662 --> 00:53:30.272
Am I pretty enough?

880
00:53:30.315 --> 00:53:33.014
Is my body good enough?
And all that crap.


881
00:53:45.026 --> 00:53:46.593
But once you're onstage,

882
00:53:46.636 --> 00:53:50.118
your job is to entertain
your audience.


883

As the years go by,

00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:27.590
I wish I also had something
else that I could do.


889
00:54:27.634 --> 00:54:30.811
There's only so far I think
I can go with this,


890
00:54:30.854 --> 00:54:32.769
but I don't, at this point
in my life,


891
00:54:32.813 --> 00:54:35.337
really have that many
other options.

I went to school
for theater.

Might as well shoot yourself
in the foot.

That's actually why
I moved here to New York.


895
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.478
I wanted to be
a part of that.


896
00:54:50.657 --> 00:54:52.702
I just wasn't cut out
for the hustle of it.


897
00:54:52.746 --> 00:54:55.749
The cutthroat nature of it,
it just wasn't for me.


898
00:55:00.449 --> 00:55:02.407
And then there's the guilt
that goes with it,


899
00:55:02.451 --> 00:55:04.453
because you move here and
everybody back home is going,

"So, what are you doing now?"

901
00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.500
And it's like,
I'm waiting tables.

You feel like a big fucking
loser and a disappointment.

All the things your mom
ever said to you,

00:55:16.683 --> 00:55:18.859
like, this is a pipe dream.

with yourself?

Right now I'm going through a
lot of transitions in my life.


907
00:55:38.269 --> 00:55:43.840
I was diagnosed
with seronegative arthritis,


908
00:55:43.884 --> 00:55:46.800
which is a version of rheumatoid
arthritis, in 2000.


909
00:55:57.811 --> 00:55:59.290
I was in remission
for 10 years,


910
00:55:59.334 --> 00:56:00.901
and then it came back.

911
00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.557
It's very complex.

912
00:56:05.601 --> 00:56:09.518
Like I look healthy
and I look like, good.


913
00:56:09.561 --> 00:56:15.002
But I don't always feel good
and I'm not fully healthy.

run through our new number

My body was so bad,


918
00:56:42.159 --> 00:56:45.510
it was so--
I could barely move.


919
00:56:45.554 --> 00:56:49.210
My range of motion and
my flexibility is very limited,

920
00:56:49.253 --> 00:56:53.867
because my knees are in so much
pain and they're so stiff.


921
00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:59.089
For shows, usually
adrenaline kicks in,


922
00:56:59.133 --> 00:57:00.787
but that's not healthy
to live on adrenaline,


923
00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:02.745
and to perform
on adrenaline.


924
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:05.095
If we could just play
Scott's intro,


925
00:57:05.139 --> 00:57:08.577
and then we'll play
your opening number, okay?


926
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.622
[man singing scales]

927
00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:12.407
[Darlinda]
I see the changes in Minnie.


928
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:14.801
She has some days
that are really hard,


929
00:57:14.844 --> 00:57:17.151
and it can be
really frustrating for me,


930
00:57:17.194 --> 00:57:19.370
because it's like, oh, well,
we can't go down on the floor,


931
00:57:19.414 --> 00:57:21.982
you know, or we can't do this
or we can't do this.


932
00:57:22.025 --> 00:57:24.854
You know, sometimes I feel like,
how are we gonna get any better


933
00:57:24.898 --> 00:57:27.378
if you can't do
this thing?


934
00:57:27.422 --> 00:57:31.121
[woman] We have another
East Village legend.


935
00:57:31.165 --> 00:57:36.431
She is considered the one-woman riot of burlesque.

936
00:57:36.474 --> 00:57:38.868
Let's give it up
for Minnie Tonka.


937
00:57:38.912 --> 00:57:42.132
Minnie Tonka!

-[audience cheers]

939
00:57:51.272 --> 00:57:58.322
[Minnie]
I've been so selective in what
energy I'm going to put out.


940
00:57:58.627 --> 00:58:01.108
But at the same time
it's been this balance.


941
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:03.327
Like, oh, I don't want people
to forget about me, you know?


942
00:58:03.371 --> 00:58:06.287
So it's like,
I have to keep this persona


943
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:08.419
of, like, Minnie Tonka,
whoo-hoo!


944
00:58:08.463 --> 00:58:10.944
[audience cheering]

945
00:58:16.645 --> 00:58:19.300
It's been this massive,

946
00:58:19.343 --> 00:58:23.739
just emotional and physical
journey and change.


947
00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:28.396
I think my perspective
on everything


948
00:58:28.439 --> 00:58:30.789
is changing right now.

949

And welcome to the 12th annual
New York Burlesque Festival.

[all cheer]

954
00:59:15.704 --> 00:59:19.708
He's thinking, is it a man or
a woman, is it a man or a woman?


955
00:59:19.751 --> 00:59:21.797
Sir, the answer is no.

956
00:59:22.841 --> 00:59:24.234
[laughter]

957
00:59:24.278 --> 00:59:26.671
[Jen Gapay]
It's been going great.


958
00:59:26.715 --> 00:59:28.195
We're on Day 3 today.

959
00:59:28.238 --> 00:59:30.197
We are at the
Saturday Spectacular


960
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.155
in B.B. King's
in Times Square.


961
00:59:32.199 --> 00:59:37.117
This is kind of our
crème de la crme of performers.


962
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.989
Murray Hill hosts tonight.

963
00:59:40.033 --> 00:59:42.513
And then we feature
basically the best in burlesque


964
00:59:42.557 --> 00:59:44.211
from around the world.

965
00:59:49.999 --> 00:59:51.566
This is for all the ladies

966
00:59:51.609 --> 00:59:54.743
who think living
in New York City is glamorous.


967
00:59:59.878 --> 01:00:02.229
I got really sick.

968
01:00:02.272 --> 01:00:04.144
Like I had a panic attack
just before.


969
01:00:04.187 --> 01:00:06.015
[car horn honks]

970
01:00:06.059 --> 01:00:08.017
This might be something
that the audience might not


971
01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:10.802
like it or get it.

972
01:00:10.846 --> 01:00:12.848
If an act is weird,
sometimes if people


973
01:00:12.891 --> 01:00:14.458
are uncomfortable
or if it's weird-looking,


974
01:00:14.502 --> 01:00:16.852
if people are uncomfortable
they'll laugh.


975
01:00:16.895 --> 01:00:20.421
I was afraid, like, if one
person started laughing,


976
01:00:20.464 --> 01:00:22.684
that I would fall
into that thing


977
01:00:22.727 --> 01:00:25.556
of treating it
like a joke.


978
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.602
But I didn't want
to make fun of myself.


979
01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:29.952
-[audience applauds]
-[Murray] Ladies and gentlemen,


980
01:00:29.996 --> 01:00:33.869
our next performer, she's doing
a brand-new number.


981
01:00:33.912 --> 01:00:36.132
That's right, and if you
don't know burlesque,


982
01:00:36.176 --> 01:00:38.656
know that no one ever says that
or does that.


983
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.398
She's doing
a brand-new number.

[audience cheers]

985
01:00:45.054 --> 01:00:46.664
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's not Monday,


986
01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:48.884
it's not Tuesday,
it's not Wednesday,


987
01:00:48.927 --> 01:00:50.233
it's not Thursday.

01:00:50.277 --> 01:00:54.107
Right now it's Gal Friday!

[Gal Friday]
When I was up there,


992
01:02:05.134 --> 01:02:07.702
everything just
sort of clicked.


993
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.315
And then it just all
came out of me,


994
01:02:12.359 --> 01:02:14.883
and it was such a great,
honest moment.


995
01:02:32.944 --> 01:02:34.685
And I was throwing
my all into it.


996
01:02:34.729 --> 01:02:37.210
It was that thing of, like,

997
01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:41.214
feeling, like,
sexually repressed.


998
01:02:45.827 --> 01:02:48.221
Until the hood came off.

999
01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.571
And then it was just
like an orgasm.

everybody: Gal Friday!


1002

[Gal Friday]
After the New York
Burlesque Festival,


1003
01:03:43.014 --> 01:03:46.104
I was surprised at how much
it ripped from me.


1004
01:03:46.148 --> 01:03:49.151
Everything I wanted it to be
kind of exploded out.


1005
01:03:50.848 --> 01:03:53.503
You know, like, it was just
enough out of my comfort zone,

1006
01:03:53.547 --> 01:03:56.637
but still had aspects
of who I am as a performer.


1007
01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:01.250
Like, I just performed it,
and it felt really good,


1008
01:04:01.294 --> 01:04:06.124
and it felt real,
and it felt from the heart.


1009
01:04:06.168 --> 01:04:09.258
And I think it's a rare thing
to hit on something


1010
01:04:09.302 --> 01:04:13.262
that felt really honest,
but also felt right.


1011

[inaudible]

1012
01:05:04.139 --> 01:05:08.709
I'm feeling really excited,
and nervous and, you know,


1013
01:05:08.752 --> 01:05:11.929
it's like, the pressure's on,
you know?

interviewed.

-[woman laughs]
-[Darlinda] Hi.


1019
01:05:20.024 --> 01:05:22.592
My God, you look
beautiful.


1020
01:05:22.636 --> 01:05:25.029
Oh, my God,
she's not joking.


1021
01:05:25.073 --> 01:05:27.728
No, you're... yeah.

1022
01:05:27.771 --> 01:05:31.906
[interviewer]
When did you find out Darlinda
was a burlesque performer?


1023
01:05:31.949 --> 01:05:33.386
Well, at birth.

1024
01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.388
[laughs]

1025
01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.912
The day she was born,

1026
01:05:37.955 --> 01:05:39.914
I was in the hospital room,
okay?


1027
01:05:39.957 --> 01:05:41.611
And she must have been
three hours old,


1028
01:05:41.655 --> 01:05:43.221
and she had
eye contact.


1029
01:05:43.265 --> 01:05:45.049
And I have witnesses.

1030
01:05:45.093 --> 01:05:48.357
Fifteen people came
to visit me that day.


1031
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:53.275
And she literally looked around
the room in everybody's eyes,


1032
01:05:53.319 --> 01:05:55.582
and they remember
that day.


1033
01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:57.671
It was very freaky, yes.

1034
01:05:57.714 --> 01:06:00.108
So she had stage presence
at birth.

What are your feelings
about the Schlep Sisters?


1037

They're funny.

1038
01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.724
But they're also--
they're very--


1039
01:06:07.768 --> 01:06:09.552
they're cute in a way.

1040
01:06:09.596 --> 01:06:11.293
They're adorable.

1041
01:06:11.337 --> 01:06:12.642
[interviewer]
Do you have any jitters


1042
01:06:12.686 --> 01:06:14.644
about them going on
in competitions?


1043
01:06:14.688 --> 01:06:16.124
They'll win.

1044
01:06:16.167 --> 01:06:17.908
[laughs]
They'll win.


1045
01:06:17.952 --> 01:06:19.257
You heard it here.

1046
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:20.998
Yeah!

[indistinct chatter]

1048
01:06:31.052 --> 01:06:33.750
I got this for, like,
$9 from China on eBay.


1049
01:06:33.794 --> 01:06:36.536
And with-- plus shipping,
it was like 14 bucks.


1050
01:06:36.579 --> 01:06:37.667
Is this hot or what?

1051
01:06:37.711 --> 01:06:39.669
[man]
It's amazing.


1052
01:06:39.713 --> 01:06:41.671
[Minnie]
So anyway, you guys--


1053
01:06:41.715 --> 01:06:44.065
you need to take a photo
of me in the hallway.


1054
01:06:45.196 --> 01:06:47.068
How are you feeling?

1055
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:49.200
[Hinda] Well, obviously,
I'm filled with pride.


1056
01:06:49.244 --> 01:06:50.550
Oh, I want to cry.

1057
01:06:50.593 --> 01:06:53.466
Well, every time
I see you perform,


1058
01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.816
it brings me back
to that moment


1059
01:06:55.859 --> 01:06:58.819
when you were figure skating
the very first time


1060
01:06:58.862 --> 01:07:00.473
and you competed,
you were like four years old.


1061
01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:03.476
When I see you out there
bringing joy to everybody


1062
01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:07.480
and joy to yourself,
there is such pride.


1063
01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.960
So I want you to know that.

1064
01:07:10.004 --> 01:07:13.834
We're just, like, really, really
grateful and really excited.


1065
01:07:15.009 --> 01:07:18.142
You know, just, like,
being here


1066
01:07:18.186 --> 01:07:20.406
is so much more

1067
01:07:20.449 --> 01:07:22.843
than just getting
the opportunity to compete.


1068
01:07:22.886 --> 01:07:24.148
I just feel like it's, you know,

1069
01:07:24.192 --> 01:07:25.628
this validation
from the universe


1070
01:07:25.672 --> 01:07:29.545
that, like, you know,
I'm healing.


1071
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:31.329
And the stage
is really slippery,


1072
01:07:31.373 --> 01:07:34.158
so I'm nervous about that!

1073
01:07:34.202 --> 01:07:36.465
-I'm so sorry you told me that.
-Yeah, I know.

01:07:36.509 --> 01:07:37.858
-[laughs]
-You're going to flip.


1075

I messaged him first


1229
01:18:19.673 --> 01:18:22.893
-on OkCupid.
-[man] Yeah.


1230
01:18:22.937 --> 01:18:24.547
I saw that he liked the movie
Pooty Tang.


1231
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:25.853
Oh, you likePooty Tang.

1232
01:18:25.896 --> 01:18:27.855
If you liked
The Last Dragon,


1233
01:18:27.898 --> 01:18:29.683
I might pop out a kid
right now.


1234
01:18:29.726 --> 01:18:31.554
And of course I loved
The Last Dragon.


1235
01:18:31.598 --> 01:18:33.600
And he's like, "I saw it in
the theater like three times."


1236
01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:35.167
[both laugh]

1237
01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:38.561
And I was, like, wet as fuck,
so it was on.


1238
01:18:38.605 --> 01:18:40.824
[laughs]

1239
01:18:40.868 --> 01:18:45.046
I said, "I work at night,
I'm a performer."


1240
01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:46.352
When I mentioned I did
burlesque, he was like,


1241
01:18:46.395 --> 01:18:48.310
"Oh, that's what
I actually figured."


1242
01:18:48.354 --> 01:18:50.399
Do you know how hard it is
to find a normal picture,


1243
01:18:50.443 --> 01:18:55.012
when all your pictures of you
titties and, like, eyebrows.


1244
01:18:55.056 --> 01:18:56.884
It was so hard for me
to find a picture


1245
01:18:56.927 --> 01:18:59.495
where I didn't have eyebrows,
like, thickly drawn on,


1246
01:18:59.539 --> 01:19:03.108
you know, and four inches
of makeup.


1247
01:19:05.022 --> 01:19:07.112
I was like, oh, I work a lot
at the Slipper Room,


1248
01:19:07.155 --> 01:19:09.070
which he had been to.

1249
01:19:09.114 --> 01:19:12.073
To me I was like, what is
a better way to show someone


1250
01:19:12.117 --> 01:19:16.121
what I do than to be, like,
this is my house.


1251
01:19:16.164 --> 01:19:17.687
[emcee]
It's Friday night.


1252
01:19:17.731 --> 01:19:19.385
It's gals' night.

1253
01:19:19.428 --> 01:19:22.953
Please come up close.
Make good friends with her.


1254
01:19:22.997 --> 01:19:24.694
I went with a friend of mine
to see her perform


1255
01:19:24.738 --> 01:19:26.131
at the Slipper Room.

1256
01:19:28.394 --> 01:19:31.614
And I got butt naked.
Matt puts his dick on my head.


1257
01:19:31.658 --> 01:19:33.834
And then I sat on his face.
[laughs]


1258
01:19:33.877 --> 01:19:36.184
-[Sebastian]
Then we went to IHOP.
-[Gal Friday] Oh, yeah.


1259
01:19:36.228 --> 01:19:39.187
Then we went to IHOP at,
like, 4:00 in the morning.


1260
01:19:40.188 --> 01:19:42.843
It was romance.

1261
01:19:42.886 --> 01:19:44.627
It was definitely like
the most interesting date


1262
01:19:44.671 --> 01:19:46.934
I had had in
a very long time.


1263
01:19:55.682 --> 01:19:57.640
[Gal Friday]
During the first date,


1264
01:19:57.684 --> 01:20:00.426
we had like long periods
of not talking.


1265
01:20:00.469 --> 01:20:03.037
But it didn't feel like I was
searching out for things to say.


1266
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.127
It was just like, oh, now we're
having a moment of silence.


1267
01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:09.435
It's just like, I can be me.

1268
01:20:12.177 --> 01:20:15.223
You know, it's nice that
I don't have to be on.


1269
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.792
I don't always
have to be Gal Friday.


1270
01:20:43.512 --> 01:20:46.472
[interviewer]
Where do you see yourself
as a burlesque performer


1271
01:20:46.515 --> 01:20:50.911
as you continue
on this journey?


1272
01:20:50.954 --> 01:20:54.784
[Hazel]
With burlesque becoming
so much more mainstream,


1273
01:20:54.828 --> 01:20:58.701
you get a lot of shows
of sparkly women in costumes


1274
01:20:58.745 --> 01:21:01.965
and not a lot of substance
behind it.


1275
01:21:02.009 --> 01:21:05.273
And I'm one of those girls
in the sparkly costumes.


1276
01:21:06.622 --> 01:21:08.494
I'm a little
pretty princess.


1277
01:21:08.537 --> 01:21:11.192
And that's what I like to put
onstage, because that's me.


1278
01:21:11.236 --> 01:21:14.761
And the thing is, it has to be
part of your personality,


1279
01:21:14.804 --> 01:21:17.503
what you put onstage.

1280
01:21:17.546 --> 01:21:20.941
When I get to do burlesque,
I can be sexy,


1281
01:21:20.984 --> 01:21:22.551
I can be stupid.

1282
01:21:22.595 --> 01:21:28.035
I can be gorgeous,
or ugly, or funny.


1283
01:21:29.036 --> 01:21:30.864
I can do anything I want

1284
01:21:30.907 --> 01:21:32.648
when I get out
onstage.


1285
01:21:32.692 --> 01:21:35.738
And that's kind of magical.

1286
01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:41.657
[Minnie]
I made the decision
to change my life,


1287
01:21:41.701 --> 01:21:47.359
focus on me, to put myself
and my healing first.


1288
01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:50.187
But I didn't know what to do,

1289
01:21:50.231 --> 01:21:53.974
so I ended up getting this
awesome part-time job.


1290
01:21:54.017 --> 01:21:56.977
Just administration work
for a synagogue.


1291
01:22:02.374 --> 01:22:05.725
[emcee]
Let's get this horah started


1292
01:22:05.768 --> 01:22:08.467
with the Schlep Sisters!

1293
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:10.556
[cheers and applause]

1294
01:22:13.254 --> 01:22:15.082
[Darlinda]
This partnership,
the Schlep Sisters,


1295
01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:17.302
is like the longest
partnership that I've ever had.


1296
01:22:17.345 --> 01:22:20.653
[Minnie]
To quote Viva La Fever,
burlesque legend,


1297
01:22:20.696 --> 01:22:22.742
"Congratulations on your
first 10 years."


1298
01:22:22.785 --> 01:22:25.222
And that was super inspiring
when she said that.


1299
01:22:25.266 --> 01:22:26.789
We didn't even
look at it that way.


1300
01:22:26.833 --> 01:22:28.748
We were like,
our first 10 years.


1301
01:22:28.791 --> 01:22:30.576
-Yeah.
-Wow.


1302
01:22:57.037 --> 01:22:58.865
[Gal Friday]
Know what I think
we're gonna need?


1303
01:22:58.908 --> 01:23:00.780
-[Sebastian] What?
-Is even more coffee.


1304
01:23:00.823 --> 01:23:02.303
[Sebastian]
More coffee?


1305
01:23:02.347 --> 01:23:04.131
The espresso.
I'm burning through it.


1306
01:23:04.174 --> 01:23:06.002
[Sebastian]
Okay, I will pick some up.


1307
01:23:06.046 --> 01:23:08.440
-Thank you.
-I'm taking the rent also.


1308
01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:09.789
Oh, thanks.

1309
01:23:09.832 --> 01:23:11.094
Love you.

1310
01:23:11.138 --> 01:23:13.009
[Sebastian]
Bye, I love you.


1311
01:23:18.406 --> 01:23:20.147
Tits, check.

1312
01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:21.757
Legs, check.

1313
01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:24.804
Vagina, check.

1314
01:23:38.992 --> 01:23:42.992
