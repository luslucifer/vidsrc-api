[Jim Carrey] You’re tuned to Dawn FM

384
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:36.261
The middle of
nowhere on your dial


385
00:30:36.302 --> 00:30:40.098
So sit back and unpack

386
00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:42.725
You may be here awhile

387
00:30:42.766 --> 00:30:46.062
Now that all future plans
have been postponed


388
00:30:46.103 --> 00:30:47.688
And it’s time to look back

389
00:30:47.729 --> 00:30:49.357
on the things you
thought you owned


390
00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:50.816
Do you remember them well?

391
00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:54.445
Were you high
or just stoned?


392
00:30:54.486 --> 00:30:57.866
And how many grudges did
you take to your grave?


393
00:30:57.907 --> 00:31:01.160
When you weren’t liked or
followed, how did you behave?


394
00:31:01.201 --> 00:31:04.664
Was it often a dissonant
chord you were strumming?


395
00:31:04.706 --> 00:31:09.418
Were you ever in tune with
the song life was humming?


396
00:31:09.459 --> 00:31:12.546
If pain’s living on
when your body’s long gone


397
00:31:12.589 --> 00:31:15.632
And your phantom regret
hasn’t let it go yet


398
00:31:15.675 --> 00:31:19.137
You may not have died
in the way that you must


399
00:31:19.178 --> 00:31:22.681
All specters are haunted
by their own lack of trust


400
00:31:22.724 --> 00:31:25.767
When you’re all out of time,
there’s nothing but space


401
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:27.603
No hunting, no gathering

402
00:31:27.645 --> 00:31:29.479
No nations, no race

403
00:31:29.522 --> 00:31:33.275
And Heaven is closer than
those tears on your face


404
00:31:33.318 --> 00:31:35.736
When the purple rain falls

405
00:31:35.777 --> 00:31:38.031
We are all bathed
in it’s grace


406
00:31:41.158 --> 00:31:44.411
Heaven’s for those
who let go of regret


407
00:31:44.454 --> 00:31:49.249
And you have to wait here
when you’re not all there yet


408
00:31:49.292 --> 00:31:52.587
But you could be there
by the end of this song


409
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:55.631
Where The Weeknd’s so good
and he plays all week long


410
00:31:55.672 --> 00:31:58.760
Bang a gong, get it on

411
00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:06.184
And if your broken heart’s heavy
when you step on the scale


412
00:32:06.226 --> 00:32:09.520
You’ll be lighter than air
when they pull back the veil


413
00:32:09.562 --> 00:32:12.982
Consider the flowers,
they don’t try to look right


414
00:32:13.024 --> 00:32:16.360
They just open their petals
and turn to the light


415
00:32:17.486 --> 00:32:19.697
Are you listening real close?

416
00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:22.242
Heaven’s not that, it’s this

417
00:32:22.283 --> 00:32:24.076
It’s the depth of this moment

418
00:32:24.118 --> 00:32:26.829
You don’t reach for bliss

419
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.207
God knows life is chaos

420
00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:32.960
But He made one thing true

421
00:32:33.002 --> 00:32:35.045
You gotta unwind your mind

422
00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:37.090
Train your soul to align

423
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.968
And dance til you find
that divine boogaloo


424
00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:46.556
In other words

425
00:32:50.561 --> 00:32:54.940
You gotta be Heaven,
to see Heaven


426
00:32:56.859 --> 00:33:00.112
May peace be with you
