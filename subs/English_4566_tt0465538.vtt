1
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.989
Michael.

2
00:00:21.098 --> 00:00:24.155
Dear Michael. Of course it's you.
Who else could they send?


3
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.154
Who else could be trusted?

4
00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.951
And I know it's a long way
and you're ready to go to work.


5
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.518
All I'm saying is just wait,
just please hear me out.


6
00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:35.194
Because this is not an episode,
relapse, fuckup.


7
00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:37.791
I'm begging you, Michael,
I'm begging you.


8
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.918
Try to make believe
this is not just madness...


9
00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:43.625
because this is not
just madness.


10
00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:46.922
Two weeks ago,
I came out of the building, okay?


11
00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:49.190
I'm running across 6th Avenue,
there's a car waiting.


12
00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:53.525
I got exactly 38 minutes to get
to the airport, and I'm dictating.


13
00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.923
There's this panicked associate
sprinting along beside me...


14
00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:58.390
scribbling in a notepad,
and suddenly she starts screaming...


15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.918
And I realize we're standing
in the middle of the street...


16
00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:05.793
the light's changed and there's this
wall of traffic, speeding towards us.


17
00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:07.421
And I freeze, I can't move.

18
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:10.648
And I'm suddenly consumed
with the overwhelming sensation...


19
00:01:10.668 --> 00:01:12.256
that I'm covered
with some sort of film.


20
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:17.391
And it's in my hair, in my face.
It's like a glaze, like a coating.


21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.157
And at first I thought:
"Oh, my God, I know what this is".


22
00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:23.045
This is some sort of amniotic,
embryonic fluid.


23
00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:27.081
I'm drenched in afterbirth,
the chrysalis. I've been reborn".


24
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.327
But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...


25
00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:35.123
this poor woman screaming, and I'm
thinking "No, this is not rebirth".


26
00:01:35.363 --> 00:01:39.059
This is some kind
of giddy illusion of renewal...


27
00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:41.726
that happens in the final
moment before death".


28
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:45.153
And then, I realize, "No, no,
this is completely wrong"...


29
00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:47.650
because I looked back
at the building...


30
00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:51.386
and I had the most stunning
moment of clarity.


31
00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:53.254
I realized, Michael...

32
00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:57.360
that I had emerged, not through
the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...


33
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.727
not through the portals
of our vast and powertul law firm...


34
00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:04.123
but from the asshole
of an organism...


35
00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:09.258
whose sole function
is to excrete the poison...


36
00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:12.285
the ammo, the defoliant
necessary for other larger...


37
00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:15.751
more powertul organisms to destroy
the miracle of humanity.


38
00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:20.417
And that I had been coated
in this patina of shit...


39
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.564
for the best part of my life.

40
00:02:22.824 --> 00:02:24.752
And the stench of it, and the stain
of it, would in all likelihood...


41
00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:26.750
take the rest of my life to undo.

42
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.816
I took a deep, cleansing
breath and I set that notion aside.


43
00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:31.525
I tabled it.

44
00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:36.690
I said to myself: "As clear as this may
be, as potent a feeling as this is...


45
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.097
as true a thing as I believe that I
have witnessed today, I must wait.


46
00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.663
It must stand the test of time".

47
00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.320
And, Michael, the time is now.

48
00:02:49.257 --> 00:02:52.024
I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already told you.


49
00:02:52.224 --> 00:02:55.061
Tell me about U/North, Barry.
They're your clients.


50
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:59.187
Why you're settling a six-year-old
case on the fly at midnight?


51
00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:01.455
'Cause I'm writing this story
whether you like it or not.


52
00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:03.723
What does that exactly mean?

53
00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:05.421
Give me something I can print.

54
00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:14.282
We found 97.

55
00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:24.681
I've got that cunt from the
Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.


56
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:26.319
She will not go away.

57
00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:31.994
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

58
00:03:32.164 --> 00:03:35.061
Hi, Marty. It's Bridget Klein.
We're going with a story tomorrow...


59
00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:37.528
about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?


60
00:03:38.827 --> 00:03:42.083
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...


61
00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:43.822
pending and unresolved.

62
00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:46.789
Till such time as our client
has their day in court...


63
00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.346
or the plaintiffs come to their senses
and drop the suit...


64
00:03:49.356 --> 00:03:50.585
I'll have nothing
of value to tell you.


65
00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:54.950
You're closing the U/North case,
you're settling.


66
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.647
You're up there right now with like

67
00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:01.524
You deadline was 20 minutes ago.

68
00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.581
You're fishing for a story or trying
to get out of writing a retraction...


69
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:06.489
In either case,
I wish you the best of luck.


70
00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:09.985
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

71
00:04:59.624 --> 00:05:00.354
I'll see the turn.

72
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:07.646
Check.

73
00:05:10.294 --> 00:05:10.753
Check.

74
00:05:11.822 --> 00:05:12.381
Check.

75
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.119
Half the pot. 200.

76
00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:16.287
$200 to go.

77
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:29.214
You don't remember me?

78
00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.151
We playd together a couple times.

79
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.646
That lamp place on Bower.
That guy's showroom?


80
00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:40.283
- The Galaxy.
- That's it.


81
00:05:40.723 --> 00:05:42.551
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?


82
00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.387
My old partner bid that job,
the plumbing.


83
00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:50.183
- You don't remember me?
- I remember you.


84
00:05:51.162 --> 00:05:52.421
'Cause I lost a lot
of weight since then.


85
00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.348
You bought some hair, too.

86
00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.416
With your money.

87
00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:00.682
What happened with the bar?

88
00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:03.290
You just had to be a rock star.

89
00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.685
I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the TV on.


90
00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:09.413
That was a good location.

91
00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:12.520
That's what my partner
kept telling me.


92
00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:21.551
Good to see you again.

93
00:06:55.586 --> 00:06:56.076
Hello?

94
00:06:56.555 --> 00:06:57.684
- Michael.
- Walter.


95
00:06:57.954 --> 00:07:01.440
Thank God, there you are.
Look, I got a situation.


96
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.646
A big problem. A client of mine, he
just called, he hit a guy with his car.


97
00:07:05.656 --> 00:07:07.454
He thinks he did.
He thinks he hit him.


98
00:07:07.524 --> 00:07:08.253
Just now?

99
00:07:08.253 --> 00:07:11.091
Yes, ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.


100
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.188
He's home now.
He's there waiting.


101
00:07:13.858 --> 00:07:14.317
Where?

102
00:07:14.927 --> 00:07:18.913
Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.


103
00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:20.011
Is he drunk?

104
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:22.849
No, no. It's the first thing
I asked him. He's sober.


105
00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:24.577
Tell him to stay off the phone.

106
00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:27.314
All right. But you're on it?
I mean, you can get up there?


107
00:07:27.324 --> 00:07:29.482
Because this guy
he's a huge client, Michael.


108
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:31.620
This is half my book,
this guy, okay?


109
00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:33.688
I'm walking to the car right now.

110
00:07:33.757 --> 00:07:37.054
Okay. Let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.


111
00:07:37.184 --> 00:07:40.950
Let me know you're on the way and I'll
get right back to you with the details.


112
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.139
All right. I'll be in the car.

113
00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:38.781
What they did, you see,
they changed the grade there.


114
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:40.449
They widened the street.

115
00:08:40.689 --> 00:08:43.576
I'm sure somebody told them
that was an improvement.


116
00:08:43.586 --> 00:08:48.521
But now, when it rains
and when there is fog...


117
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:52.457
and with this new angle...

118
00:08:52.457 --> 00:08:54.375
these sodium lamps,
it's blinding.


119
00:08:54.385 --> 00:08:56.373
That corner right there.
It is just blinding.


120
00:08:56.653 --> 00:08:58.002
Well, they're gonna have
to work that out.


121
00:08:58.022 --> 00:09:00.679
Yeah. And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.


122
00:09:00.689 --> 00:09:05.384
How many times have we
talked about that corner? Dell?


123
00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:07.882
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.


124
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.356
The circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?


125
00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:16.643
What interests me is finding the
strongest possible criminal attorney...


126
00:09:16.653 --> 00:09:18.211
that can be here
in the next 15 minutes.


127
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.408
Well, that sounds ominous.

128
00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:24.075
We have some good relationships
up here in Westchester.


129
00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:27.042
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?


130
00:09:27.522 --> 00:09:29.450
- Not the kind you need.
- What kind is that?


131
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.489
A trial lawyer.

132
00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:33.515
Somebody who can see this all the way
through. That's not what I do.


133
00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:36.882
Okay. I think we're gonna have
to pull Walter back in on this.


134
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:40.219
I wanna get Walter back on the phone.
I wanna get him back into the mix.


135
00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:44.145
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.


136
00:09:44.354 --> 00:09:48.220
We don't have time for Walter. Your
options here are gonna get very smaller.


137
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.378
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!


138
00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:52.007
I'm suggesting that you go local.

139
00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:54.614
And I'm telling you that there are some
people up here that I like for this.


140
00:09:54.624 --> 00:09:58.140
Great. That's it? That's what
you got for me? Unbelieveble!


141
00:09:59.489 --> 00:10:01.477
I have been a client
at Kenner & Bach for 12 years!


142
00:10:01.487 --> 00:10:03.575
Do you think that I have paid
that retainer every month...


143
00:10:03.655 --> 00:10:05.483
so I can get a place
at the back of the line?


144
00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:08.949
You left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...


145
00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:11.417
six miles from the State
Police barracks.


146
00:10:11.617 --> 00:10:13.844
Believe me, if there's a line,
you're right up front.


147
00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:16.821
I can get a lawyer any time I want to,
I don't need you for that.


148
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:20.907
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!


149
00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:22.645
I don't know what Walter promised you,
but I can tell you this.


150
00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:27.780
A miracle worker. That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.


151
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.048
"Hang tight.
I'm a sending you a miracle worker".


152
00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:31.536
- He misspoke.
- About what?


153
00:10:31.556 --> 00:10:34.314
About the fact that
you're the firm's fixer?


154
00:10:34.323 --> 00:10:35.083
Elliot.

155
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:39.248
The guy was running
in the street!


156
00:10:39.718 --> 00:10:44.413
You take that, you add the fog,
the lamps, the angle.


157
00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:49.278
Why is he doing running in the middle
of the street at midnight?


158
00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:50.617
Answer me!

159
00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:06.581
What if someone
had stolen the car?


160
00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:11.546
Happens all the time.

161
00:11:12.085 --> 00:11:15.851
Cops like hit and runs. The work
them hard, they clear them fast.


162
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.348
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.


163
00:11:19.348 --> 00:11:23.284
Tomorrow, they're going to be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...


164
00:11:23.284 --> 00:11:24.842
hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

165
00:11:25.721 --> 00:11:26.710
And the guy you hit?

166
00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:30.746
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.


167
00:11:33.983 --> 00:11:35.072
There's no play here.

168
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.448
There's no champagne room.

169
00:11:38.888 --> 00:11:41.006
I'm a janitor.
I'm not a miracle worker.


170
00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:43.773
The math on this is simple.

171
00:11:44.022 --> 00:11:46.480
The smaller the mess,
the easier it is for me to clean up.


172
00:11:48.388 --> 00:11:52.284
That's the police, isn't it?

173
00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:53.173
No.

174
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:55.751
They don't call.

175
00:12:01.285 --> 00:12:01.844
Hello.

176
00:12:03.782 --> 00:12:05.011
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

177
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.569
I'm sorry to wake you up.

178
00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:10.845
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

179
00:12:12.613 --> 00:12:13.413
You got a pen?

180
00:15:47.075 --> 00:15:49.303
FOUR DAYS EARLIER

181
00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:57.614
Mom, where's my cards?

182
00:16:03.378 --> 00:16:04.577
Where's my cards?

183
00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:20.741
Is my other deck in here?

184
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:21.570
Did you eat?

185
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:24.107
Dad's down there waiting already.

186
00:16:24.277 --> 00:16:25.706
There were cards in our bathroom.

187
00:16:26.475 --> 00:16:27.773
Yes, I had a waffle.

188
00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:30.241
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.


189
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.799
It's a miracle.

190
00:16:36.075 --> 00:16:36.944
Gloves?

191
00:16:44.476 --> 00:16:45.066
Henry!

192
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:50.770
Come on!

193
00:16:53.647 --> 00:16:54.476
Get in.

194
00:16:57.114 --> 00:16:57.703
Got it?

195
00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:06.834
No one's even sure exactly
where they are...


196
00:17:06.844 --> 00:17:09.541
because there's no borders
of landmarks or anything.


197
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.947
And the town?
It's not even a town really.


198
00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:16.444
It just is this camp where all these
people have gathered to hide.


199
00:17:16.674 --> 00:17:17.233
Right.

200
00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:20.939
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.


201
00:17:21.449 --> 00:17:24.276
All these people that are hiding
in the woods and trying to stay alive.


202
00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:26.004
This is where they all came.

203
00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:29.840
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...


204
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.238
Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.


205
00:17:32.308 --> 00:17:34.466
There's like

206
00:17:34.545 --> 00:17:35.335
Okay.

207
00:17:35.874 --> 00:17:37.672
And nobody has any alliances.

208
00:17:37.912 --> 00:17:40.539
You can't even say who
you are because, you don't know...


209
00:17:41.209 --> 00:17:42.737
maybe the person
you're talking to...


210
00:17:43.047 --> 00:17:45.604
maybe they're like your
mortal enemy in the wars.


211
00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:48.761
So it's just completely like
everybody for themselves.


212
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:49.870
Sounds familiar.

213
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.376
It's really good. I'm serious.
You should really read it.


214
00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:56.173
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.


215
00:17:56.573 --> 00:17:59.100
- How much you wanna bet?
- I don't know. How much you got?


216
00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:02.697
- You got your bus pass?
- It's in my locker.


217
00:18:02.877 --> 00:18:04.934
You're not even gonna
look at it, are you?


218
00:18:05.874 --> 00:18:07.242
- The book?
- Yes.


219
00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:08.701
Bring it on Saturday and I'll...

220
00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:12.137
I did already! I left in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.


221
00:18:12.377 --> 00:18:13.036
Okay.

222
00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:15.614
Well, here we go.

223
00:18:16.143 --> 00:18:18.631
Go! Teach these people something.

224
00:18:23.076 --> 00:18:24.704
- See you later, Dad!
- Yeah, kiddo.


225
00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:28.171
Thanks.

226
00:18:35.413 --> 00:18:39.070
Lot number 52, lot of assorted
mixing bowls, assorted sizes.


227
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.437
30 dollars to start.

228
00:18:41.447 --> 00:18:45.373
You can get me to 40 and I got. And 50
now. I have 60 dollars back there.


229
00:18:45.443 --> 00:18:47.431
60 dollars. Get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars here.


230
00:18:47.441 --> 00:18:50.068
70 dollars. I have now 70 dollars.
I have 80 dollars there.


231
00:18:50.078 --> 00:18:52.766
80 dollars, this gentleman here.

232
00:18:52.776 --> 00:18:55.903
90 dollars. Give me the 100?
I have 100 dollars now.


233
00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:08.939
He says you're
still gonna be short.


234
00:19:12.106 --> 00:19:12.835
How short?

235
00:19:13.644 --> 00:19:16.901
$60.000 plus the points,
$75.000.


236
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.008
- That's liquor and everything?
- What'd you think it was gonna be?


237
00:19:20.408 --> 00:19:23.774
I don't know. Less. $30, $20.

238
00:19:23.844 --> 00:19:26.931
He took $1.500
on a refrigerator I paid $4.000.


239
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.569
Make a bid.

240
00:19:31.277 --> 00:19:33.434
Are you telling me
you don't have the $75.000?


241
00:19:33.774 --> 00:19:35.173
Just lying around, no.

242
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.597
We both know it's your brother
I should be talking to.


243
00:19:40.607 --> 00:19:41.236
Forget that.

244
00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:45.532
Michael, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.


245
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:49.408
But Timmy's name stays
in the book till we're clear.


246
00:19:50.007 --> 00:19:54.333
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.


247
00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:56.771
He's upstate.
His wife took him back.


248
00:19:56.771 --> 00:19:57.799
I don't know where he is.

249
00:19:58.179 --> 00:19:59.468
He's got to have something.

250
00:20:00.537 --> 00:20:01.935
Yeah, he's got
the two kids with her.


251
00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:06.011
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing
waitress that he knocked up.


252
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.568
He's got four Michelin Radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.


253
00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:12.564
Make an offer.

254
00:20:16.071 --> 00:20:19.238
I had a wife who was a drunk.
It was a beautiful girl. Young girl.


255
00:20:20.606 --> 00:20:24.732
But live like that? Even they do
a program, she did once, two years.


256
00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:26.330
And then they slip. Forget it.

257
00:20:27.339 --> 00:20:28.898
It's like you're strapped
to a bomb.


258
00:20:30.746 --> 00:20:32.174
What's my timeframe here?

259
00:20:33.743 --> 00:20:34.432
I don't know.

260
00:20:35.441 --> 00:20:36.570
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

261
00:20:39.207 --> 00:20:39.767
I'll ask.

262
00:21:08.078 --> 00:21:09.626
- Hey, Michael.
- Morning, Carl.


263
00:21:18.437 --> 00:21:21.964
I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.


264
00:21:21.974 --> 00:21:24.032
You have to let me know how
brave he wants to be.


265
00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:26.130
I'm not sure how brave
he can be right now.


266
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.967
We just got a confirmation hearing
scheduled for end of the month.


267
00:21:28.977 --> 00:21:30.066
Any chance she knows that?

268
00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:34.171
Well, it was in the paper. Maybe
she got someone to read it to her.


269
00:21:34.611 --> 00:21:37.838
She called his wife yesterday.
This is a total nightmare!


270
00:21:38.337 --> 00:21:40.735
My guess is she's gonna want
to hang onto the condo.


271
00:21:40.745 --> 00:21:41.903
Come on, that's insane!

272
00:21:42.243 --> 00:21:44.860
What can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.


273
00:21:45.809 --> 00:21:46.858
It's just unbelievable.

274
00:21:47.138 --> 00:21:50.405
Find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.


275
00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:52.363
Or you can tell him
to call me directly.


276
00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:54.001
I hear you. Let me get into it.

277
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:55.270
Thanks.

278
00:21:56.509 --> 00:21:57.767
Where are we with Marty?

279
00:21:58.836 --> 00:21:59.825
We left word!

280
00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:02.502
Hold on. How old is the kid?

281
00:22:02.502 --> 00:22:04.840
He's not a kid. He's 22.

282
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.668
- This is Miami?
- Nope, Key Biscayne.


283
00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:07.867
They charged him.

284
00:22:08.606 --> 00:22:11.094
Reckless endangerment.
My client...


285
00:22:12.043 --> 00:22:16.798
Really what they want' a reality
check on the attorney down there.


286
00:22:18.037 --> 00:22:19.865
Wayne said you have
some connections there?


287
00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:21.363
- Yeah, let me get a pen.
- Thank you.


288
00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:25.869
Now if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.


289
00:22:26.038 --> 00:22:27.337
Even with the appointment?

290
00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:30.134
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.


291
00:22:30.134 --> 00:22:33.501
Unless they get a call from a district
supervisor, then nobody moves.


292
00:22:33.501 --> 00:22:36.498
- But your guy can do that?
- He's a former Commissioner.


293
00:22:36.768 --> 00:22:39.864
And none of this comes back to me, ok?
'Cause that doesn't do any good.


294
00:22:39.874 --> 00:22:41.633
No, look, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.


295
00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:43.900
- Can you hang on a minute?
- Yeah, sure.


296
00:22:46.568 --> 00:22:47.467
Are we merging?

297
00:22:48.875 --> 00:22:50.394
Marty Bach's in London.

298
00:22:50.743 --> 00:22:53.600
First they said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building...


299
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.538
so I called back up,
I know you want this meeting.


300
00:22:55.808 --> 00:22:58.495
She tells me the truth.
He's really in London.


301
00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:02.272
Are we merging?
That's what everyone's saying.


302
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:04.369
All these Brits
that this time it's real.


303
00:23:04.739 --> 00:23:05.708
Like I would know.

304
00:23:07.107 --> 00:23:07.866
I don't know.

305
00:23:08.275 --> 00:23:11.762
But even if we are, even if they merged,
it wouldn't affect us, right?


306
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:13.830
Your phone's ringing.

307
00:23:15.438 --> 00:23:15.958
Evan?

308
00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:20.233
Here's what I'll do.

309
00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:22.861
Let me give him a call and set up
a meeting for next week.


310
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.398
I'll walk her in,
I'll make the introduction.


311
00:23:26.367 --> 00:23:29.824
At the moment, U/North currently
has 70.000 employees...


312
00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:32.501
in 62 countries
around the world...


313
00:23:34.609 --> 00:23:35.628
around the planet.

314
00:23:37.576 --> 00:23:40.473
Operating in 62 countries
around the planet.


315
00:23:41.901 --> 00:23:46.267
At work in more than 60 countries
around the globe.


316
00:23:49.533 --> 00:23:52.401
We have, right now, we have...

317
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:55.957
At U/North right now,
we've got 75.000 employees...


318
00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:58.934
in over 60 countries
around the planet.


319
00:23:58.934 --> 00:24:02.370
We are a very successful
and highly diversified company.


320
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.768
So you can imagine the volume...

321
00:24:04.838 --> 00:24:06.756
and the variety of legal issues
we have to deal with is...


322
00:24:06.766 --> 00:24:07.625
overwhelming.

323
00:24:07.635 --> 00:24:08.364
It just enormous.

324
00:24:11.341 --> 00:24:16.526
So, you can imagine
the volume of legal issues.


325
00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:19.423
It's quite substantial.

326
00:24:20.302 --> 00:24:22.030
And as General Counsel,
what I do...


327
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.698
what our in-house
department does...


328
00:24:25.167 --> 00:24:30.432
is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...


329
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:32.260
to determine the jurisdiction...

330
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.597
and to outsource our business...

331
00:24:35.866 --> 00:24:39.063
to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.


332
00:24:39.632 --> 00:24:42.300
So, with all that pressure
and workload...


333
00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:44.967
how do you keep a balance
between work and life?


334
00:24:45.806 --> 00:24:46.665
Balance?

335
00:24:49.802 --> 00:24:52.929
I think that's,
that's something that...


336
00:24:53.199 --> 00:24:55.796
you search
for your whole life, isn't it?


337
00:24:56.665 --> 00:24:58.893
It's a shifting balance, really.

338
00:24:58.903 --> 00:25:03.128
It's, you know, you try to...

339
00:25:03.138 --> 00:25:05.866
When you really are enjoying
what it is you do...


340
00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:07.834
who needs balance?

341
00:25:09.632 --> 00:25:11.999
There's your balance.
There's your balance.


342
00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:15.496
When you're really enjoying what
it is you do' there's your balance.


343
00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:17.634
When Don asked me to take...

344
00:25:17.833 --> 00:25:21.290
When Don Jeffries brought...
Don Jeffries brought me.


345
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.927
Don Jeffries brought me
in here 12 years ago...


346
00:25:24.407 --> 00:25:26.834
trusted me, mentored me.

347
00:25:27.574 --> 00:25:29.661
Welcomed me
into the U/North family.


348
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.564
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never really dreamt...


349
00:25:36.564 --> 00:25:38.592
that I would have the opportunity
to move into his position.


350
00:25:39.102 --> 00:25:40.860
But, is it challenging?

351
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:41.689
Yes.

352
00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:47.863
I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.


353
00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:53.267
But you realize you've been taught
to be ready, and you take the helm.


354
00:25:53.797 --> 00:25:57.663
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...


355
00:25:57.663 --> 00:25:59.191
you're in the wrong place.

356
00:25:59.401 --> 00:26:00.860
It's your department...

357
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.066
your capacity to make
tough decisions in real time...


358
00:26:05.665 --> 00:26:07.223
We're in the middle
of an interview.


359
00:26:07.703 --> 00:26:09.191
They said it was urgent.

360
00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:12.628
Jesus!

361
00:26:13.966 --> 00:26:15.265
Oh, for Chrissake!

362
00:26:16.763 --> 00:26:18.102
You're saying he did this in...

363
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:20.160
Oh, my God.

364
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:20.759
Barry.

365
00:26:22.098 --> 00:26:22.797
Hang on.

366
00:26:23.696 --> 00:26:27.862
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.


367
00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:31.628
Oh, Michael...

368
00:26:32.368 --> 00:26:35.764
I took a deep, cleansing breath
and set that notion aside. I tabled it.


369
00:26:35.764 --> 00:26:41.099
I said to myself:
"As clear as this may be...


370
00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:44.655
as potent as I believe I have
witnessed today, it must wait.


371
00:26:45.204 --> 00:26:48.102
It must stand the test of time".

372
00:26:48.102 --> 00:26:50.859
And Michael, the time is now.

373
00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:54.625
This moment, today, here,
this room, this air...


374
00:26:54.705 --> 00:26:58.691
and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.


375
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.369
There's a reason.

376
00:27:01.338 --> 00:27:03.096
A reason it's you, Michael.

377
00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:07.762
Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.


378
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:11.668
Nurse Michael, the secret hero,
the keeper of the hidden sins.


379
00:27:11.668 --> 00:27:14.155
Tell me you can see that,
for God's sake.


380
00:27:14.465 --> 00:27:19.430
But, I mean, yeah, yeah.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.


381
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.266
It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.


382
00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:26.293
It was obvious, and therapeutically,
it was completely useless...


383
00:27:26.303 --> 00:27:30.319
because, I swear to you, I could
stand here and tear off my skin...


384
00:27:30.498 --> 00:27:34.324
and I could not get down
to where this thing is living!


385
00:27:34.564 --> 00:27:38.500
Six years, Michael, Six years,
I've absorbed this poison.


386
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.156
400 depositions, a hundred motions,
five changes of venue...


387
00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:44.824
85.000 documents in discovery!

388
00:27:45.203 --> 00:27:49.129
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?


389
00:27:49.329 --> 00:27:53.905
I've spent 12º% of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!


390
00:27:53.895 --> 00:27:55.193
We had an agreement, Arthur.

391
00:27:55.203 --> 00:27:59.289
One night, I look up
and there's Marty in my office.


392
00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:00.388
He's got some champagne.

393
00:28:00.738 --> 00:28:05.493
He tells me we just hit 30.000 hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.


394
00:28:05.802 --> 00:28:09.359
So, an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse Chelsea...


395
00:28:09.369 --> 00:28:12.955
with two Lithuaniana redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.


396
00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:16.651
I'm laying there and I'm trying
not to come and I wanna...


397
00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:19.289
make it last,
so I start doing the math.


398
00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:22.855
I think: "30,000 hours, what is that?"
That's 24 times 30.


399
00:28:22.865 --> 00:28:28.559
That's 720 hours in a month,

400
00:28:28.569 --> 00:28:30.297
- Arthur!
- No, wait, wait!


401
00:28:30.297 --> 00:28:33.524
Because it's years! It's lives!

402
00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:36.521
And the numbers are making me
dizzy and, you know...


403
00:28:36.531 --> 00:28:39.618
now instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, I can't stop.


404
00:28:39.628 --> 00:28:41.996
Is this me?

405
00:28:41.996 --> 00:28:46.401
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep, and eat...


406
00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:51.126
and defend this one horrific
chain of carcinogenic molecules?


407
00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.154
Is that my destiny?
Is that my fate?


408
00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:56.031
- Listen, you promised me.
- Is that it, Michael?


409
00:28:56.031 --> 00:28:59.428
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?


410
00:28:59.428 --> 00:29:01.655
Is that the correct answer
to the multiple choice of me?


411
00:29:01.735 --> 00:29:05.032
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine, but you call me first.


412
00:29:05.102 --> 00:29:06.960
- That was our agreement!
- Sue me!


413
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.089
We okay in there?

414
00:29:09.368 --> 00:29:09.827
We're fine.

415
00:29:11.136 --> 00:29:11.895
We're fine.

416
00:29:15.501 --> 00:29:16.900
They killed them, Michael.

417
00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:20.127
Those small farms,
the family farms.


418
00:29:21.236 --> 00:29:23.393
Did you meet Anna?

419
00:29:24.103 --> 00:29:24.752
No.

420
00:29:24.832 --> 00:29:28.129
You gotta see her, you gotta talk
to her. She's a miracle.


421
00:29:28.129 --> 00:29:29.827
She's God's
perfect little creature.


422
00:29:30.596 --> 00:29:33.893
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 12 percent of my life...


423
00:29:33.963 --> 00:29:38.058
destroying perfect Anna, her dead
parents and her dying brother.


424
00:29:38.068 --> 00:29:39.417
When was the last time
you took one of these?


425
00:29:39.427 --> 00:29:42.524
No, I'm not losing this.
Everything is now finally significant.


426
00:29:42.534 --> 00:29:45.151
The world is a beautiful and radiant
place. I'm not trading that for this.


427
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:47.029
If it's real, the pill won't kill it.

428
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:48.688
I have blood on my hands!

429
00:29:48.698 --> 00:29:51.285
You are the senior litigating partner
of one of the largest...


430
00:29:51.295 --> 00:29:54.282
most respected law firms
in the world. You are a legend.


431
00:29:54.302 --> 00:29:56.560
- I'm an accomplice!
- You're a maniac-depressive.


432
00:29:57.399 --> 00:29:59.557
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

433
00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.523
Let's get out of Milwaukee
and we'll talk about it.


434
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:09.526
We can back from the hospital
and everybody was crying...


435
00:30:10.066 --> 00:30:13.822
and we were in shock,
but we still, we had to milk.


436
00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:15.550
The cows won't wait, will they?

437
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.618
No.

438
00:30:18.497 --> 00:30:20.425
And when you went to the barn?

439
00:30:21.095 --> 00:30:23.692
We found the note.
My sister found it.


440
00:30:23.862 --> 00:30:24.661
From your mother?

441
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:25.650
Yes.

442
00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:27.798
Could you read it for us, please?

443
00:30:29.026 --> 00:30:31.464
Just read the third paragraph,
just the highlighted section there.


444
00:30:33.462 --> 00:30:36.829
"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy
or any of the people down at the..."


445
00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:38.787
Anna.

446
00:30:40.265 --> 00:30:41.284
It's all right, Anna, go on.

447
00:30:41.933 --> 00:30:43.851
- I'm just...
- Excuse me.


448
00:30:43.861 --> 00:30:45.260
- Anna, they're...
- What's he doing?


449
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.327
Excuse me. She...
No, this is testimony.


450
00:30:48.327 --> 00:30:49.855
Excuse me, I have an objection.

451
00:30:50.165 --> 00:30:53.182
You can be a witness here.
You can be a witness.


452
00:30:53.192 --> 00:30:54.680
I am not a witness to this...

453
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.888
Anna, I love you.

454
00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:03.322
And I'm sitting here,
and I'm listening to you and I swear...


455
00:31:03.332 --> 00:31:07.517
that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.


456
00:31:09.925 --> 00:31:13.122
This strange conference
table moment.


457
00:31:13.132 --> 00:31:17.697
- This is my offering!
- I want this on the record!


458
00:31:17.697 --> 00:31:19.215
How do you turn it off?

459
00:31:19.225 --> 00:31:22.592
This is my offering. My clothes
are my offering. This is my shame.


460
00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:26.358
My credentials! I'm ashamed!

461
00:31:26.558 --> 00:31:30.014
And I love you
and I swear to God...


462
00:31:37.727 --> 00:31:38.486
I guess that's it.

463
00:31:46.428 --> 00:31:47.357
When do we get Don?

464
00:31:48.266 --> 00:31:50.494
She said to try back
in half an hour.


465
00:31:51.063 --> 00:31:52.921
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?


466
00:31:55.199 --> 00:31:57.057
- Closed four minutes ago.
- Shit.


467
00:31:59.325 --> 00:32:01.522
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.


468
00:32:01.662 --> 00:32:03.320
Todd, could I get
that coffee now?


469
00:32:06.198 --> 00:32:09.454
Who is this guy they sent
from New York? I never heard of him.


470
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.490
Michael Raymond Clayton.

471
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:18.225
Born September 9, 1959, Saint Joseph
Hospital, Bronx, New York.


472
00:32:18.925 --> 00:32:22.121
Father is NYPD patrolman
Raymond Xavier Clayton.


473
00:32:22.491 --> 00:32:24.759
Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.

474
00:32:25.098 --> 00:32:29.893
Graduates Washingtonville Central
High School, New York, in 1977.


475
00:32:30.493 --> 00:32:34.189
Graduates Saint John's University,

476
00:32:35.697 --> 00:32:39.424
82 through 86, he's ADA with the Queens
District Attorney's office.


477
00:32:40.263 --> 00:32:44.888
And 1986, he's with the Joint Manhattan
Queens Organized Crime Task Force.


478
00:32:45.527 --> 00:32:48.085
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.


479
00:32:49.164 --> 00:32:50.023
So, he's a partner?

480
00:32:51.531 --> 00:32:53.549
No. He's listed
as Special Counsel.


481
00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:55.997
Says he specializes
in wills and trusts.


482
00:32:56.826 --> 00:32:59.383
He goes from criminal prosecution
to wills and trusts?


483
00:32:59.393 --> 00:33:01.521
He's been there 17 years,
he's not a partner?


484
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.257
This is the guy they send?
Who is this guy?


485
00:33:20.392 --> 00:33:21.621
- Hi.
- Close the door.


486
00:33:23.089 --> 00:33:27.285
All right. So, none of you
had any ideal he was coming?


487
00:33:27.694 --> 00:33:29.493
To Milwaukee?
For a deposition?


488
00:33:29.493 --> 00:33:31.221
We thought there was some
kind of settlement in the works.


489
00:33:31.231 --> 00:33:32.989
We thought it had
something to do with that.


490
00:33:33.359 --> 00:33:37.884
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.


491
00:33:38.164 --> 00:33:41.221
He's supposed to take his medication,
he's fallen behind on that.


492
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:44.188
He's back on the mend. He's
gonna be fine in three or four days.


493
00:33:44.258 --> 00:33:49.093
I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.


494
00:33:49.322 --> 00:33:51.850
This is not a piece of information
that you wanna be out in front of.


495
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.187
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.


496
00:33:56.795 --> 00:33:57.414
All right.

497
00:33:59.023 --> 00:34:02.889
We're stuck here overnight. I'm gonna
take him home tomorrow if I can.


498
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:05.376
Who's in charge
of the deposition schedule?


499
00:34:05.396 --> 00:34:06.984
- I am.
- Where do we stand with that?


500
00:34:06.994 --> 00:34:09.052
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.


501
00:34:09.062 --> 00:34:11.510
You keep doing what you
were planning on doing.


502
00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:15.116
The other side wants to talk about it,
they can call N.Y. I need his briefcase.


503
00:34:15.126 --> 00:34:17.094
Arthur's? I don't...
I didn't see it.


504
00:34:17.464 --> 00:34:18.483
He said it was in the room.

505
00:34:19.092 --> 00:34:20.720
It might be the stuff
Jody grabbed.


506
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:21.749
Find it.

507
00:34:28.822 --> 00:34:32.419
So, all these people start
having these dreams, okay?


508
00:34:32.928 --> 00:34:37.413
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for like Navajos and stuff?


509
00:34:37.893 --> 00:34:40.051
Yeah. I think so. Like a...

510
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.718
like a special dream.

511
00:34:43.327 --> 00:34:47.343
Except this is like a whole bunch
of people having the same dream.


512
00:34:47.863 --> 00:34:51.120
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.


513
00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:52.888
They don't know why or anything.

514
00:34:53.327 --> 00:34:55.555
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.


515
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:58.652
That they've been summoned.

516
00:34:59.461 --> 00:35:00.390
That's the chapter.

517
00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.417
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest".


518
00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:04.716
That's the title.

519
00:35:05.255 --> 00:35:09.990
But do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?


520
00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:13.087
No. That's what's so cool.

521
00:35:13.457 --> 00:35:14.885
They all think it's just them.

522
00:35:15.225 --> 00:35:19.321
That maybe they're like going crazy,
so they don't wanna admit it.


523
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.578
Yeah, but they're not crazy,
are they?


524
00:35:22.028 --> 00:35:25.085
No, It's real.
It's really happening.


525
00:35:25.894 --> 00:35:28.751
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

526
00:35:30.729 --> 00:35:34.555
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...


527
00:35:34.555 --> 00:35:36.783
to hear it?

528
00:35:37.392 --> 00:35:39.450
Yeah, but later they will.

529
00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.688
So, if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.


530
00:35:43.856 --> 00:35:45.414
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?


531
00:35:46.123 --> 00:35:47.752
I called my dad.
It's a friend of his.


532
00:35:47.922 --> 00:35:50.819
- Who?
- Mr. Edens. You don't know him.


533
00:35:51.328 --> 00:35:53.186
- Hello?
- Henry, it's ater eleven.


534
00:35:54.055 --> 00:35:55.524
I gotta get off now.

535
00:35:55.624 --> 00:36:00.319
No, wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.


536
00:36:00.759 --> 00:36:02.657
The book is "Realm and Conquest".

537
00:36:03.326 --> 00:36:04.984
"Realm and Conquest".

538
00:36:05.194 --> 00:36:06.712
It's Book One with the red cover.

539
00:36:06.922 --> 00:36:07.821
Henry, give me the phone.

540
00:36:08.421 --> 00:36:10.788
I gotta go.
Tell my dad I called. Okay?


541
00:36:11.957 --> 00:36:15.683
Yeah. Thank, thank,
thank you, Henry, thank.


542
00:36:20.488 --> 00:36:23.645
"Realm and Conquest". Thank.

543
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:49.349
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

544
00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:51.587
- You're late.
- I know. Sorry.


545
00:36:51.587 --> 00:36:53.355
It was a little more
complicated than we thought.


546
00:36:53.355 --> 00:36:55.313
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.


547
00:36:55.323 --> 00:36:57.451
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.


548
00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.118
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.


549
00:37:00.688 --> 00:37:04.913
Once he gets back on his regular
medication, it's just a matter of time.


550
00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:08.579
- Have you seen the v-deo? The tape?
- I heard about it.


551
00:37:08.989 --> 00:37:10.617
What happened after is worse.

552
00:37:11.626 --> 00:37:15.093
This is in the parking lot.
People running for their cars.


553
00:37:15.093 --> 00:37:17.081
He's there in his socks,
nothing else.


554
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.716
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I will not
sit with this sickness any longer.


555
00:37:21.726 --> 00:37:24.124
I cannot aid
this sickness any longer".


556
00:37:24.723 --> 00:37:25.782
What does this mean?

557
00:37:26.891 --> 00:37:27.790
I'm not sure.

558
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:30.987
You've been with him
the whole evening. What's he saying?


559
00:37:30.987 --> 00:37:34.713
This is totally unacceptable.

560
00:37:34.953 --> 00:37:37.850
This is a three billion
dollar class action lawsuit.


561
00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:39.918
In the morning,
I have to call my board.


562
00:37:40.087 --> 00:37:42.477
I have to tell them
that the architect of


563
00:37:42.478 --> 00:37:44.952
our entire defense
has been arrested...


564
00:37:44.952 --> 00:37:49.348
for running naked in a snowstorm chasing
the plaintiffs through a parking lot.


565
00:37:49.418 --> 00:37:50.247
I understand.

566
00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:54.383
What sickness
is he talking about?


567
00:37:54.523 --> 00:37:56.651
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.


568
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.139
Frostbite.

569
00:37:58.888 --> 00:38:00.017
You think this is funny?

570
00:38:00.357 --> 00:38:02.874
His wife was sick
and she died last year.


571
00:38:02.884 --> 00:38:06.610
His daughter doesn't talk to him. He's
all alone. All he does is your case.


572
00:38:07.789 --> 00:38:10.257
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.


573
00:38:10.726 --> 00:38:13.214
And you're somehow
the authority on this?


574
00:38:13.923 --> 00:38:16.350
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.


575
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:18.878
I helped bring him home,
I watched him get better. That's it.


576
00:38:19.158 --> 00:38:23.783
Come on! You didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...


577
00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:24.982
you hired him
because he's a killer.


578
00:38:24.992 --> 00:38:28.478
And because he's brilliant and because
he's crazy enough to grind away...


579
00:38:28.488 --> 00:38:31.245
on a case like this
for six years without a break.


580
00:38:31.255 --> 00:38:32.744
We pay for his time.

581
00:38:32.754 --> 00:38:34.052
I thought you wanted
an explanation.


582
00:38:34.752 --> 00:38:36.650
In the morning,
I'm calling Marty Bach...


583
00:38:37.789 --> 00:38:39.847
but then you know that.
Thank you, Michael.


584
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.776
He was mostly just quiet.

585
00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:51.684
I heard him moving around, I gave him
another pill about 15 minutes ago.


586
00:38:51.854 --> 00:38:54.012
- He took it?
- A deal's a deal, right?


587
00:38:54.751 --> 00:38:55.810
A super job, Elston.

588
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.746
You get to NY, you need tickets
to the game, you let me know.


589
00:39:00.316 --> 00:39:01.375
I'll do that for sure.

590
00:39:22.383 --> 00:39:23.152
Did you see her?

591
00:39:24.121 --> 00:39:25.710
- Who?
- Anna.


592
00:39:27.048 --> 00:39:27.678
No.

593
00:39:29.456 --> 00:39:32.253
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.


594
00:39:33.991 --> 00:39:34.880
Well, we need her.

595
00:39:37.388 --> 00:39:41.374
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.


596
00:39:43.182 --> 00:39:45.779
Well, if anybody can explain it
to them, it's you, Arthur.


597
00:39:48.487 --> 00:39:49.645
No, they're lost.

598
00:39:50.854 --> 00:39:53.581
- They have what they want.
- Let it go, man.


599
00:39:54.021 --> 00:39:55.110
This what you wanted?

600
00:39:57.557 --> 00:39:58.446
To be a janitor?

601
00:39:59.455 --> 00:40:01.973
Live like this? All this?

602
00:40:03.282 --> 00:40:04.151
Do what you do?

603
00:40:05.889 --> 00:40:06.978
It can't be.

604
00:40:10.184 --> 00:40:12.412
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.


605
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:15.779
That's how it feels.

606
00:40:17.217 --> 00:40:21.243
Well, I know that
we've been summoned.


607
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:24.540
Get some sleep.

608
00:40:41.423 --> 00:40:42.012
Hello.

609
00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:45.748
Hi, I'm looking for Vern.

610
00:40:47.357 --> 00:40:48.336
You have a number?

611
00:40:48.815 --> 00:40:52.112
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said that I could call at any time.


612
00:40:52.122 --> 00:40:53.380
No, the account number.

613
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.476
The code? I do. I have it right here.
One moment.


614
00:41:00.313 --> 00:41:01.512
Excuse me one moment.

615
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:05.888
It's right here. 12
-BKR-6.

616
00:41:06.517 --> 00:41:07.916
12
-BKR-6.

617
00:41:09.814 --> 00:41:11.152
Am I speaking with Vern?

618
00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:14.039
It's Mr. Verne.

619
00:41:14.489 --> 00:41:16.847
Mr. Verne, I'm sorry,
it's so late.


620
00:41:17.886 --> 00:41:19.444
Don said that I could...

621
00:41:21.722 --> 00:41:23.620
I'm not exactly sure
how this works.


622
00:41:24.149 --> 00:41:26.677
- Do you have email at your current?
- I do.


623
00:41:27.516 --> 00:41:29.074
- Are you alone?
- I am.


624
00:41:29.484 --> 00:41:33.919
Okay, I'm gonna upload you a little
encryption package we like to use.


625
00:41:33.919 --> 00:41:36.437
It's pretty self-explanatory.

626
00:41:38.055 --> 00:41:41.042
You're gonna have to give me a minute
to get to my desk. Okay? Hold on.


627
00:41:41.052 --> 00:41:41.981
Okay. Thank you.

628
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.437
UNITED-NORTHFIELD, CULCITATE-INTERNAL
RESEARCH MEMORANDUM 229


629
00:41:55.447 --> 00:41:58.404
THE RELEASE OF THESE
MARKETING OF CULCITATE


630
00:41:58.414 --> 00:42:01.281
ARE AT RISK
FOR HUMAN TISSUE DAMAGE


631
00:42:01.281 --> 00:42:04.148
IT IS TASTELESS, COLORLESS,
POTENTIALLY LETHAL EXPOSURE


632
00:42:07.315 --> 00:42:08.474
What I was wondering is...

633
00:42:09.313 --> 00:42:12.610
I have an option on the lease
for six more years...


634
00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:16.436
and I was wondering if there's
any way that I could lay that off.


635
00:42:16.915 --> 00:42:18.114
Is the lease worth anything?

636
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.878
89 hundred a month. It's...

637
00:42:25.147 --> 00:42:26.735
The fixtures are gone,
but there's the bar...


638
00:42:29.682 --> 00:42:31.840
there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.


639
00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:35.147
But there's a...

640
00:42:40.312 --> 00:42:42.869
Yeah, I understand.
No, I understand.


641
00:42:45.147 --> 00:42:46.635
Okay, right. Thanks.

642
00:42:47.914 --> 00:42:48.783
Right, thanks.

643
00:42:59.682 --> 00:43:00.541
Come on, Arthur!

644
00:43:03.918 --> 00:43:04.577
Arthur!

645
00:43:06.815 --> 00:43:07.804
Arthur, open the door.

646
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.778
Arthur, open the door!

647
00:43:16.145 --> 00:43:17.673
Arthur, open the goddamned door!

648
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:20.471
Arthur, open...

649
00:43:21.879 --> 00:43:23.078
Open the fucking door!

650
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:30.940
Arthur!

651
00:43:32.648 --> 00:43:34.376
Goddamn it, Arthur!
Open the fucking...


652
00:43:45.615 --> 00:43:46.304
Arthur?

653
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:51.109
MAKE BELIEVE
IT'S NOT JUST MADNESS


654
00:43:58.312 --> 00:43:59.841
- Mr. Verne, hey!
- Hey, Danny.


655
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:01.978
You guys are early.
I was just pulling the other bags.


656
00:44:02.448 --> 00:44:05.275
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.


657
00:44:05.585 --> 00:44:06.514
- You ready?
- Yep.


658
00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:12.977
For Christ's sake.

659
00:44:14.016 --> 00:44:15.315
Don Jeffries signed this?

660
00:44:16.214 --> 00:44:17.732
That's really his signature?

661
00:44:18.911 --> 00:44:19.850
Where's the original?

662
00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:23.037
We had a warehouse
fire years ago.


663
00:44:23.047 --> 00:44:25.245
We lost a number of documents.

664
00:44:32.248 --> 00:44:34.375
What the hell is this doing
in Arthur's bag?


665
00:44:35.884 --> 00:44:37.173
I don't know, Marty.

666
00:44:37.182 --> 00:44:40.439
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.


667
00:44:46.243 --> 00:44:47.342
What are we looking for?

668
00:44:47.882 --> 00:44:51.278
If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.


669
00:44:53.446 --> 00:44:55.144
What a mess this is.

670
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.739
I want all this...

671
00:45:01.747 --> 00:45:04.874
everything here, I want it all
packed up and sent up to the house.


672
00:45:07.182 --> 00:45:08.201
Any luck, Michael?

673
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.907
He booked a limo
from Newark Airport at three...


674
00:45:12.217 --> 00:45:13.635
got out at West Fourth Street...

675
00:45:13.645 --> 00:45:15.473
tipped the driver a hundred
bucks and walked away.


676
00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:17.441
- Did you try his apartment?
- He moved.


677
00:45:17.451 --> 00:45:18.001
I know.

678
00:45:18.311 --> 00:45:20.748
It's a loft, there's no doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.


679
00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:23.545
- I called. I got the machine.
- So, basically, he could be anywhere.


680
00:45:23.545 --> 00:45:26.942
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.


681
00:45:26.942 --> 00:45:29.439
- Where's his daughter?
- I don't know. Spain, India.


682
00:45:29.909 --> 00:45:32.276
Mars!
She's crazier than he'll ever be.


683
00:45:32.916 --> 00:45:37.211
Barry's taking over on U/North. We got
a lot of groveling to do with them.


684
00:45:37.211 --> 00:45:39.339
You didn't exactly charm
Karen Crowder, you know?


685
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:40.108
I was punting.

686
00:45:40.648 --> 00:45:43.405
You gotta saddle up here,
and get things under control.


687
00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:44.274
Saddle up?

688
00:45:44.484 --> 00:45:47.771
He needs to be under a doctor's care
immediately. He needs to be admitted.


689
00:45:47.781 --> 00:45:49.838
- Where?
- Does that really matter?


690
00:45:50.208 --> 00:45:53.335
Michael, U/North needs
to know he's under control.


691
00:45:53.345 --> 00:45:56.741
He's in a facility. They've been
shook up. They need to be reassured.


692
00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:58.969
- It's just not gonna be that easy.
- Why the hell not?


693
00:45:59.179 --> 00:46:03.115
Because the laws in the state of NY are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.


694
00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:04.773
Did you see this fucking tape?

695
00:46:04.883 --> 00:46:07.241
I'm not arguing with you.
I'm telling you how it is.


696
00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:10.897
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.


697
00:46:11.317 --> 00:46:14.783
Let's find out who knows the most
about psychiatric commitment statutes?


698
00:46:14.783 --> 00:46:16.871
I can tell you that right now.
It's Arthur.


699
00:46:29.208 --> 00:46:30.737
I'm at the door.
We're good to go.


700
00:46:32.345 --> 00:46:35.372
Roger that. Let's keep
a radio check every five, okay?


701
00:46:36.281 --> 00:46:37.770
Every five minutes, copy that.

702
00:47:01.046 --> 00:47:02.235
REALM + CONQUEST
BOOK ONE


703
00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:16.600
Hello, you've
reached Arthur's machine.


704
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.008
If you wish to leave a message,
please do so after the tone.


705
00:47:21.275 --> 00:47:22.434
Arthur, pick up the phone.

706
00:47:23.773 --> 00:47:27.839
Arthur, pick up the phone
and talk to me.


707
00:47:29.877 --> 00:47:31.964
No? Not gonna do it?

708
00:47:33.673 --> 00:47:36.610
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.


709
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:40.136
Someday you and I are gonna laugh
about it, but you gotta call me back.


710
00:47:40.446 --> 00:47:42.704
You gotta call me
back soon, Arthur.


711
00:47:43.543 --> 00:47:44.342
I'll tell you what.

712
00:47:45.511 --> 00:47:48.637
Because you said it yourself,
part of this is definitely madness...


713
00:47:48.647 --> 00:47:51.005
and there's a chemical part to this,
and you know it and I know it.


714
00:47:51.515 --> 00:47:53.672
But if you're willing
to start with that...


715
00:47:53.672 --> 00:47:56.669
then I'm more than willing
to meet you halfway and say that...


716
00:47:56.939 --> 00:48:00.675
this situation sucks. This case sucks.
U/North' sucks.


717
00:48:00.675 --> 00:48:03.333
We can start with that.
You hear me?


718
00:48:03.342 --> 00:48:05.171
I'm saying that you're right
about what we are.


719
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.937
You're crazy. I'm saying that your
behavior is out of control...


720
00:48:09.177 --> 00:48:10.645
but I'm telling you you're right.

721
00:48:10.815 --> 00:48:13.542
You called it.
We're janitors, I get you.


722
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:18.197
But we came to this, Arthur.

723
00:48:19.446 --> 00:48:21.704
We made decisions.
It didn't happen overnight.


724
00:48:22.513 --> 00:48:26.599
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"Game over. I'm into miracles".


725
00:48:27.778 --> 00:48:28.896
Arthur, come on!

726
00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:33.062
Pick up the phone
and talk to me!


727
00:48:33.072 --> 00:48:35.200
Because whatever else the hell
you think is so important...


728
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.907
you better let me help you with this
because I'm telling you straight up...


729
00:48:37.907 --> 00:48:42.812
janitor to janitor, I don't see anybody
else with a broom on the horizon.


730
00:48:42.972 --> 00:48:45.200
It's me, buddy. I'm the...

731
00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:49.106
Mailbox is full.
Your message cannot be recorded.


732
00:49:50.004 --> 00:49:50.533
Hello?

733
00:49:50.943 --> 00:49:52.571
Hello. Is Anna there?

734
00:49:52.871 --> 00:49:53.500
Hang on.

735
00:49:57.646 --> 00:49:58.265
Anna!

736
00:50:01.372 --> 00:50:02.271
Where is she? Anna!

737
00:50:05.408 --> 00:50:05.998
Anna!

738
00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:09.844
Anna, you've got a phone call!

739
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.769
Where is she? Anna!

740
00:50:27.006 --> 00:50:27.735
Hello?

741
00:50:28.505 --> 00:50:30.203
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

742
00:50:31.342 --> 00:50:32.700
Did you get some sleep?

743
00:50:33.709 --> 00:50:34.439
I guess.

744
00:50:34.778 --> 00:50:36.397
Did you think about what we said?

745
00:50:37.645 --> 00:50:38.195
Yeah.

746
00:50:38.205 --> 00:50:40.193
You didn't tell anybody,
did you?


747
00:50:40.273 --> 00:50:44.868
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.


748
00:50:45.038 --> 00:50:47.435
Yeah, because
I meant what I said.


749
00:50:47.675 --> 00:50:50.362
I know, I know. It's just...

750
00:50:51.541 --> 00:50:54.568
there's like 450 people
in this lawsuit.


751
00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:57.625
Why are you choosing me?

752
00:50:59.543 --> 00:51:01.511
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

753
00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.259
That's for sure.

754
00:51:03.609 --> 00:51:05.667
I mean, does it really matter?

755
00:51:06.176 --> 00:51:09.073
I mean, isn't it what we wait for?
To meet someone?


756
00:51:10.172 --> 00:51:11.431
And they're like a lens.

757
00:51:11.441 --> 00:51:14.238
And suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...


758
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:17.325
and nothing can
ever be the same again.


759
00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:18.564
Who you talking to?

760
00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:22.000
It's for me, okay?
I get calls, too.


761
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:23.169
That guy?

762
00:51:24.138 --> 00:51:27.265
Same guy. Same guy.

763
00:51:28.274 --> 00:51:29.033
Sorry.

764
00:51:30.771 --> 00:51:34.228
No. That's okay. My mother
used to listen to my calls.


765
00:51:34.607 --> 00:51:37.075
She can't believe I can do
anything on my own.


766
00:51:37.844 --> 00:51:39.003
Well, that'll change.

767
00:51:40.002 --> 00:51:40.971
I guess.

768
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:45.536
But see, that's something
we can show her.


769
00:51:45.536 --> 00:51:47.164
That you can do something.

770
00:51:47.174 --> 00:51:49.972
That we could do that
together if you want.


771
00:51:50.042 --> 00:51:53.198
I mean that I can
help you do that.


772
00:51:54.537 --> 00:51:56.195
I can get you twelve by Monday.

773
00:51:57.504 --> 00:51:58.833
Twelve's weak. 
Twelve looks bad.

774
00:51:59.542 --> 00:52:00.401
How do you figure that?

775
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:04.737
They look at 75, they look at you,
they're wondering what the problem is.


776
00:52:04.737 --> 00:52:07.064
Now you say twelve. That's just
gonna make people nervous.


777
00:52:07.074 --> 00:52:10.231
Gabe, this was the day before. Give me
some time to get my ducks in order here.


778
00:52:10.241 --> 00:52:11.030
What's the car worth?

779
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.997
It's lease. It's the firm's.

780
00:52:14.337 --> 00:52:18.363
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.


781
00:52:18.373 --> 00:52:20.361
I can't. I did that
three months ago.


782
00:52:21.709 --> 00:52:22.928
Are you back at the tables?

783
00:52:23.408 --> 00:52:26.494
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on!


784
00:52:29.701 --> 00:52:30.640
I hope you're kidding.

785
00:52:31.969 --> 00:52:35.835
If he finds out you're playing cards
with his money, there's no dialogue.


786
00:52:37.573 --> 00:52:38.762
Do everyone a favor.

787
00:52:39.871 --> 00:52:43.307
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.


788
00:52:44.836 --> 00:52:45.825
You got a week.

789
00:52:47.873 --> 00:52:49.961
- Hey, Michael. How are you?
- Hi, Cindy. I'm good.


790
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:54.136
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?


791
00:52:54.136 --> 00:52:56.594
I am trying to get him out
of here in 15 minutes.


792
00:52:56.604 --> 00:52:58.901
- Is he upstairs?
- Yes, he's taken over the living room.


793
00:52:58.901 --> 00:53:00.889
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.


794
00:53:01.908 --> 00:53:05.065
Soroyo, keep an eye on these kids,
make sure they're downstairs.


795
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.789
Marty?

796
00:53:24.136 --> 00:53:26.833
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.


797
00:53:27.742 --> 00:53:29.730
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this.


798
00:53:30.639 --> 00:53:32.657
He's building a case
against U/North.


799
00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:34.225
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.
- Let him?


800
00:53:34.835 --> 00:53:36.094
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

801
00:53:36.773 --> 00:53:38.961
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.


802
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.126
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.


803
00:53:43.236 --> 00:53:46.203
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.


804
00:53:47.102 --> 00:53:49.130
I've been trying him all morning.
Can't even leave a message.


805
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.689
He's got the whole
machine jammed up.


806
00:53:50.709 --> 00:53:52.727
- Is that his briefcase?
- Yes.


807
00:53:54.205 --> 00:53:55.963
- Why?
- Because we've been looking for it.


808
00:53:56.133 --> 00:53:59.799
I don't know. It came up here with
all the other stuff from his office.


809
00:53:59.799 --> 00:54:02.427
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.


810
00:54:04.435 --> 00:54:05.424
Listen, Marty...

811
00:54:07.372 --> 00:54:08.461
I'm in a bind here.

812
00:54:11.008 --> 00:54:13.525
I need a loan.
I need 80 grand.


813
00:54:14.874 --> 00:54:17.461
- I thought you were done with all that.
- It's nothing like that.


814
00:54:17.471 --> 00:54:19.489
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.


815
00:54:20.338 --> 00:54:21.307
Eighty thousand.

816
00:54:22.167 --> 00:54:23.435
I'm sorry to jump you like this...

817
00:54:23.435 --> 00:54:25.733
but I've been trying to get a meeting
alone with you for the last two weeks.


818
00:54:27.341 --> 00:54:29.669
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.


819
00:54:31.068 --> 00:54:32.626
There's nothing final
on the merger.


820
00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:35.363
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.


821
00:54:35.803 --> 00:54:38.720
Once you're out then it's me and
Barry with a room full of strangers...


822
00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.498
and I'm trying to explain
what the hell it is I do.


823
00:54:40.638 --> 00:54:43.934
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.


824
00:54:43.934 --> 00:54:45.693
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

825
00:54:45.703 --> 00:54:48.660
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years
and I got no equity.


826
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:50.228
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

827
00:54:50.298 --> 00:54:53.355
- No one forced you to buy a bar.
- I only opened it...


828
00:54:53.365 --> 00:54:55.363
so that I'd have something else,
I'd have a way out.


829
00:54:55.373 --> 00:54:57.291
I had no idea
you were so unhappy.


830
00:54:57.301 --> 00:55:00.498
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?


831
00:55:00.637 --> 00:55:03.435
- Hom many times?
- You think that's so special?


832
00:55:03.435 --> 00:55:06.262
- I was good at it.
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.


833
00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:09.498
At this, what you do,
you're great.


834
00:55:10.298 --> 00:55:14.703
For Christ's sake, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.


835
00:55:14.903 --> 00:55:17.270
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.


836
00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:22.096
And if it's nostalgia, "Boy, you should
have seen me when I was a DA in Queens".


837
00:55:22.106 --> 00:55:25.003
Let me give you a serious piece
of advice: Leave it there.


838
00:55:25.732 --> 00:55:28.629
God forbid you're not as good as you
remember, 'cause I've seen that happen.


839
00:55:30.807 --> 00:55:32.565
But I didn't come here
for advice, did I?


840
00:55:33.834 --> 00:55:37.270
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?


841
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.289
I never said that!

842
00:55:38.299 --> 00:55:39.388
No? Maybe you should have.

843
00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:46.031
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but is cancer, or something...


844
00:55:46.131 --> 00:55:47.859
we don't get it reined in
and cleaned up soon.


845
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:50.157
Everything's vulnerable.
Everything.


846
00:55:51.665 --> 00:55:53.933
- What are you telling me?
- That I'm counting on you.


847
00:55:55.402 --> 00:55:59.098
I'm telling you that by this time next
week, Arthur will be under control...


848
00:55:59.098 --> 00:56:03.124
and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.


849
00:56:03.134 --> 00:56:04.193
Jesus, Marty!

850
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:08.099
When did you get
so fucking delicate?


851
00:56:09.497 --> 00:56:10.197
I'm late.

852
00:56:50.635 --> 00:56:53.622
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?


853
00:56:53.702 --> 00:56:55.061
It's not that kind of a problem.

854
00:56:57.169 --> 00:56:59.726
- How much longer are we doing this?
- I don't know.


855
00:57:11.764 --> 00:57:15.130
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.


856
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:17.888
- Thank you very much.
- Okay. You're welcome.


857
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:28.956
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?


858
00:57:29.596 --> 00:57:31.793
- What?
- I wanna go home.


859
00:57:32.633 --> 00:57:33.562
Come on, Henry!

860
00:57:38.167 --> 00:57:38.856
Hold up!

861
00:57:41.563 --> 00:57:43.152
Stay in the car. 
Lock the door.

862
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:47.687
Arthur! Arthur!

863
00:57:48.267 --> 00:57:48.856
Wait up!

864
00:57:50.534 --> 00:57:52.962
Michael.
Jeez. You scared me!


865
00:57:55.399 --> 00:57:58.027
- Making a delivery?
- No, no.


866
00:57:58.966 --> 00:58:01.164
Very funny.
No, nothing like that.


867
00:58:01.433 --> 00:58:05.659
Here, take one, please.
Really, it's still warm.


868
00:58:05.669 --> 00:58:06.998
It's the best bread
I ever tasted.


869
00:58:11.163 --> 00:58:12.192
So, welcome home.

870
00:58:13.501 --> 00:58:16.927
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

871
00:58:16.927 --> 00:58:19.295
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.


872
00:58:19.595 --> 00:58:20.754
But you're feeling better now?

873
00:58:20.764 --> 00:58:23.820
- Much better, definitely.
- Just not enough to call me back.


874
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:27.996
Well, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...


875
00:58:28.096 --> 00:58:30.793
before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.


876
00:58:31.762 --> 00:58:32.751
And how's that going?

877
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:35.159
It's very good. I just...

878
00:58:36.228 --> 00:58:40.463
I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise.


879
00:58:40.463 --> 00:58:42.991
That's my goal.

880
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:46.517
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.


881
00:58:46.727 --> 00:58:50.893
No, you're wrong. What makes this feel
good is that I don't know where it goes.


882
00:58:52.701 --> 00:58:55.528
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?


883
00:58:56.098 --> 00:58:59.394
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?


884
00:59:00.833 --> 00:59:03.700
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.


885
00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:07.226
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.


886
00:59:07.965 --> 00:59:11.452
You need help.
Before this goes too far.


887
00:59:11.931 --> 00:59:12.950
You got great cards here.

888
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.087
If you keep your clothes on, you can do
pretty much any goddamn thing you want.


889
00:59:16.267 --> 00:59:19.594
You want out, you're out;
you wanna bake bread, go with God.


890
00:59:20.193 --> 00:59:22.820
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...


891
00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:24.589
and you've got your arms
wrapped around it.


892
00:59:24.599 --> 00:59:26.457
Well, I said I was sorry.

893
00:59:26.966 --> 00:59:28.315
You thought the hotel
was overwhelming?


894
00:59:28.335 --> 00:59:31.022
You keep pissing on this case and
they're gonna cut you off at the knees.


895
00:59:31.032 --> 00:59:32.589
I don't know what
you're talking about.


896
00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:35.067
I'm out there covering for you.
I'm telling them everything's fine.


897
00:59:35.068 --> 00:59:38.463
You're fine. Everything is gonna
be fine. Everybody is cool.


898
00:59:38.464 --> 00:59:41.731
I'm out there running this "price of
genius" story to anybody who'll listen.


899
00:59:41.731 --> 00:59:43.725
I wake up this morning
and I hear that


900
00:59:43.726 --> 00:59:48.333
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin
and you're messing with documents.


901
00:59:48.334 --> 00:59:49.079
How can you know that?

902
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.292
They're gonna take
everything from you.


903
00:59:50.362 --> 00:59:53.889
Your partnership, your equity,
they're gonna pull your license.


904
00:59:53.899 --> 00:59:56.586
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me. Are you denying it?


905
00:59:56.596 --> 00:59:57.495
How does he know?

906
00:59:57.565 --> 00:59:59.553
I don't know
and I don't give a shit!


907
01:00:04.528 --> 01:00:06.496
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur!


908
01:00:06.566 --> 01:00:08.294
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!


909
01:00:08.364 --> 01:00:09.593
Because you're walking
through a parking lot...


910
01:00:09.663 --> 01:00:13.189
you're chasing a girl through a parking
lot with your dick hanging out.


911
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.956
You think she didn't get off the phone
with you and speed-dial her attorney?


912
01:00:15.966 --> 01:00:18.054
No. She wouldn't do that.

913
01:00:18.064 --> 01:00:20.991
Really? You think that your judgment
is state of the art right now?


914
01:00:23.059 --> 01:00:27.355
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.


915
01:00:27.365 --> 01:00:28.144
I'll find somebody
to help you think this through.


916
01:00:28.164 --> 01:00:34.857
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.


917
01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:42.859
Michael, I have great affection
for you. Your life is interesting...


918
01:00:42.859 --> 01:00:44.987
but you're a bagman,
not an attorney.


919
01:00:45.696 --> 01:00:46.955
If your intention was
to have me committed...


920
01:00:46.965 --> 01:00:49.647
you should have kept
me in Wisconsin,


921
01:00:49.648 --> 01:00:51.900
where the arrest
report, the videotape...


922
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:56.155
and eyewitness of my behavior
would have jurisdictional relevance.


923
01:00:56.595 --> 01:00:58.823
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.


924
01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:02.089
And the single
determining criterion...


925
01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:04.557
for involuntary
incarceration is danger.


926
01:01:04.866 --> 01:01:07.384
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others.


927
01:01:08.393 --> 01:01:10.920
You think you got
the horses for that?


928
01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:14.227
Well, good luck and God bless,
but tell you this.


929
01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:18.423
The last place you want
to see me is in court.


930
01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:21.350
I'm not your enemy.

931
01:01:22.558 --> 01:01:23.617
Then who are you?

932
01:01:37.333 --> 01:01:38.492
We find the seed.

933
01:01:43.227 --> 01:01:44.556
We shape the soil.

934
01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:49.721
We speed the harvest.

935
01:01:52.598 --> 01:01:53.787
We feed the planet.

936
01:02:06.224 --> 01:02:07.453
We find the seed.

937
01:02:11.998 --> 01:02:13.486
We shape the soil.

938
01:02:17.492 --> 01:02:18.861
We speed the harvest.

939
01:02:21.558 --> 01:02:22.587
We feed the planet.

940
01:02:40.859 --> 01:02:41.947
What the hell is he doing?

941
01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:07.152
You've reached the voicemail of Arthur
Edens, at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.


942
01:03:07.422 --> 01:03:09.090
Please leave your message
after the tone.


943
01:03:11.427 --> 01:03:14.914
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?


944
01:03:15.194 --> 01:03:18.450
'Cause this is the moment you've been
waiting for. A special piece of paper.


945
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:22.087
So, let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...


946
01:03:22.396 --> 01:03:28.190
for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum Number 229.


947
01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:31.257
June 19th, 1991.

948
01:03:31.727 --> 01:03:32.856
"Conclusion.

949
01:03:33.455 --> 01:03:35.913
The unanticipated market
growth for Culcitate...


950
01:03:35.923 --> 01:03:37.861
by small farms
in colder climates...


951
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:41.387
demands immediate
cost-benefit analysis".


952
01:03:42.356 --> 01:03:44.484
Would you guys
like a little bit of legal advice?


953
01:03:44.923 --> 01:03:47.351
Never let a scientist
use the words...


954
01:03:47.361 --> 01:03:51.487
"unanticipated" e "immediate"
in the same sentence.


955
01:03:52.026 --> 01:03:53.884
Okay? Okay.

956
01:03:54.094 --> 01:03:56.651
"In-house field studies
have indicated...


957
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:58.679
that small short-reason farms...

958
01:03:58.689 --> 01:04:01.287
dependent on well water
for human consumption...


959
01:04:01.357 --> 01:04:05.552
are at risk for toxic particulate
concentrations at levels...


960
01:04:05.562 --> 01:04:09.688
significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage".


961
01:04:09.828 --> 01:04:12.275
Well, this is a long way
of saying that...


962
01:04:12.295 --> 01:04:15.352
you don't even have to leave your
house to be killed by our product.


963
01:04:15.722 --> 01:04:17.750
We'll pipe it
into your kitchen sink.


964
01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:20.487
- "Culcitate's great market advantage...
- Give me the phone.


965
01:04:20.497 --> 01:04:23.784
That it is tasteless, colorless
and does not precipitate...


966
01:04:24.463 --> 01:04:27.220
has the potential
to mask and intensify...


967
01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:30.157
these potentially
lethal exposures".


968
01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:31.356
Now, I love this.

969
01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:33.784
Not only is this a great product...

970
01:04:34.123 --> 01:04:37.450
it is a superb cancer
delivery system.


971
01:04:37.929 --> 01:04:40.357
"Chemical modifications
of the Culcitate product...


972
01:04:40.657 --> 01:04:44.613
the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...


973
01:04:45.122 --> 01:04:50.057
would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.


974
01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:55.322
These costs, while assumed to be
significant, were not summarized here".


975
01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.290
Which, loosely translated, means.

976
01:04:57.290 --> 01:05:01.345
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this and I'm an asshole in a lab.


977
01:05:01.555 --> 01:05:04.652
So could someone else
please make the decision?"


978
01:05:05.122 --> 01:05:09.317
"Clearly, the release of these
internal research documents...


979
01:05:09.387 --> 01:05:12.015
would compromise the effective
marketing of Culcitate...


980
01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:15.451
and must be kept
within the protective confines...


981
01:05:15.591 --> 01:05:18.918
of United-Northfield's
trade secret language".


982
01:05:20.356 --> 01:05:24.122
You don't need me to tell
you what that means.


983
01:05:24.891 --> 01:05:25.880
Good-bye.

984
01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.715
- It seemed to warrant my coming to.
- Yes.


985
01:05:34.522 --> 01:05:36.150
You have contain this.

986
01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:38.348
Contain?

987
01:05:39.057 --> 01:05:39.686
Right.

988
01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:41.714
Well, that's my question:

989
01:05:43.353 --> 01:05:47.149
What are the options
that we're looking at?


990
01:05:47.888 --> 01:05:48.877
Along those lines.

991
01:05:50.026 --> 01:05:52.144
You're talking about
the paper, the data?


992
01:05:53.792 --> 01:05:57.159
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.


993
01:05:57.888 --> 01:06:00.016
I mean something
I'm not thinking of?


994
01:06:00.855 --> 01:06:02.413
We deal in absolutes.

995
01:06:02.953 --> 01:06:05.150
Okay. I understand that. I do.

996
01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.348
The material, the papers...

997
01:06:07.358 --> 01:06:11.154
I'm not a lawyer.
We do what we can.


998
01:06:11.824 --> 01:06:12.843
Well, the other way?

999
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.789
Is the other way.

1000
01:06:21.324 --> 01:06:22.842
Maybe you wanna
bring Don in on this.


1001
01:06:22.852 --> 01:06:26.758
No. This is nothing to do
with Don. He's busy.


1002
01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:35.520
Do you think it's doable?

1003
01:06:37.887 --> 01:06:40.754
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.


1004
01:06:41.254 --> 01:06:44.420
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess.


1005
01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.050
Okay.

1006
01:06:49.825 --> 01:06:53.251
Is that "Okay, you understand"
or "Okay, proceed?"


1007
01:06:56.788 --> 01:06:58.846
Are you one? Are you two?

1008
01:06:58.856 --> 01:07:02.952
Are you three? Are you four?
Are you five? Are you six?


1009
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:05.919
Are you seven? Are you eight?
Are you nine?


1010
01:07:05.919 --> 01:07:07.547
Come on. Come on.
Come on, I said.


1011
01:07:08.886 --> 01:07:09.755
Come on.

1012
01:07:10.384 --> 01:07:12.112
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1013
01:07:12.891 --> 01:07:14.580
If I get what I wish for,
it'll kill me!


1014
01:07:15.719 --> 01:07:17.447
You're a maniac. Unbelievable!

1015
01:07:18.286 --> 01:07:19.725
Give me a hand, Eddie.

1016
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:23.651
All right, Eddie.

1017
01:07:24.919 --> 01:07:28.406
Now I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.


1018
01:07:29.824 --> 01:07:31.183
You have time for cake?

1019
01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:33.750
Yeah, I'll take one to go.

1020
01:07:34.719 --> 01:07:35.618
You going in?

1021
01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:38.945
- I'm late already.
- Shit.


1022
01:07:39.624 --> 01:07:40.813
You're not both running out?

1023
01:07:41.093 --> 01:07:42.252
I got a situation.

1024
01:07:42.721 --> 01:07:44.449
- You can't hang?
- You're going in.


1025
01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:46.617
- Yeah, I got a shift.
- So do I.


1026
01:07:48.215 --> 01:07:50.513
Come on, man?
You haven't been up here in months.


1027
01:07:50.723 --> 01:07:53.450
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.


1028
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.418
Good. You can drive him home.

1029
01:07:56.387 --> 01:07:57.286
Just stay for an hour.

1030
01:07:58.285 --> 01:07:59.584
The girls did all this stuff.

1031
01:08:01.022 --> 01:08:02.141
He'll be asleep by then.

1032
01:08:06.317 --> 01:08:07.516
Timmy's been calling me.

1033
01:08:12.391 --> 01:08:13.480
He's afraid to talk to you.

1034
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:14.479
He should be.

1035
01:08:15.188 --> 01:08:17.486
- It closed out bad, right?
- Is that what he told you?


1036
01:08:17.925 --> 01:08:19.284
The kids are freaking out.

1037
01:08:20.593 --> 01:08:21.851
The in-laws are freaking out.

1038
01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:25.118
Pammy can't stop crying long
enough to start freaking out.


1039
01:08:25.118 --> 01:08:29.154
- She took him back.
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?


1040
01:08:29.154 --> 01:08:31.881
No, fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?


1041
01:08:32.221 --> 01:08:34.279
I sold everything but the walls
and we're still short.


1042
01:08:34.289 --> 01:08:37.415
So don't talk to me about Pammy
and the kids. I've got my hands full.


1043
01:08:37.955 --> 01:08:41.152
If it was you,
he'd be in traction.


1044
01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:44.019
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1045
01:08:46.117 --> 01:08:49.173
- He's sick. It's a sickness.
- There's a fresh perspective!


1046
01:08:49.183 --> 01:08:52.450
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.


1047
01:08:54.488 --> 01:08:55.747
Is that pointed at me?

1048
01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:01.511
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?


1049
01:09:01.521 --> 01:09:03.749
I haven't bet on a game
in over a year.


1050
01:09:03.918 --> 01:09:05.946
I haven't been in a card
room in ten months.


1051
01:09:06.616 --> 01:09:10.212
I gambled on the bar,
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.


1052
01:09:10.222 --> 01:09:11.411
That was my big play, all right?

1053
01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:14.408
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.


1054
01:09:15.786 --> 01:09:17.714
Okay, okay.

1055
01:09:19.353 --> 01:09:20.541
Cool down, I hear you.

1056
01:09:26.356 --> 01:09:27.544
I'd be pissed off, too.

1057
01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:35.506
Just hang for an hour.

1058
01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:38.553
- Okay?
- Yeah.


1059
01:10:13.288 --> 01:10:15.076
Ready? And lift!

1060
01:10:15.655 --> 01:10:17.174
Ready and go.

1061
01:10:41.919 --> 01:10:42.608
Wipe.

1062
01:10:52.418 --> 01:10:53.387
You better hit it.

1063
01:11:27.722 --> 01:11:28.271
Ready!

1064
01:12:03.545 --> 01:12:06.542
Okay, I found it.
That's his number.


1065
01:12:06.852 --> 01:12:08.940
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.


1066
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.938
If I can.
As soon as I get a chance.


1067
01:12:10.948 --> 01:12:14.434
They're just running us
in circles with this. I can pull...


1068
01:12:14.454 --> 01:12:15.903
Let him go. He's got a date.

1069
01:12:15.913 --> 01:12:17.881
I've got a date
with a maniac attorney.


1070
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:20.938
- Take a night off, Mickey.
- You look tired.


1071
01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:22.946
- I'm okay. See you soon.
- Be good.


1072
01:12:23.545 --> 01:12:24.814
All right. Bye.

1073
01:12:25.483 --> 01:12:26.212
Bye, Pop.

1074
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.709
- Uncle Timmy, hey!
- How you doing, Henry?


1075
01:12:40.078 --> 01:12:41.137
Henry, get in the car.

1076
01:12:44.254 --> 01:12:45.233
Good to see you, Hen.

1077
01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.677
- What do you want?
- I've been sober eight days now.


1078
01:12:51.447 --> 01:12:54.503
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.


1079
01:12:55.512 --> 01:12:56.452
In front of the kid?

1080
01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:59.708
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.


1081
01:13:01.546 --> 01:13:04.204
I don't know how to make it right.
It's all I think about.


1082
01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:07.370
What do I do?
I don't know what to do.


1083
01:13:09.248 --> 01:13:10.947
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1084
01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:19.009
- Is he crying?
- I don't know.


1085
01:13:20.018 --> 01:13:21.536
Because of drugs, right?

1086
01:13:21.546 --> 01:13:22.945
That and everything else.

1087
01:13:55.282 --> 01:13:56.041
What?

1088
01:13:58.818 --> 01:13:59.807
Your Uncle Timmy...

1089
01:14:01.016 --> 01:14:05.881
and I mean this, on his best day,
was never as tough as you.


1090
01:14:07.549 --> 01:14:10.806
I'm not talking about
crying or the drugs or anything.


1091
01:14:10.816 --> 01:14:13.613
I'm talking about in his heart,
you understand me?


1092
01:14:14.952 --> 01:14:18.398
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss.


1093
01:14:18.748 --> 01:14:20.975
And I know you love him,
and I know why.


1094
01:14:21.245 --> 01:14:22.734
But when you see him like that...

1095
01:14:23.313 --> 01:14:26.010
you don't have to worry, because
that's not how it's gonna be for you.


1096
01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:27.978
You're not gonna be one of these
people that goes through life...


1097
01:14:28.418 --> 01:14:31.315
wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.


1098
01:14:32.813 --> 01:14:34.282
I know that. I know it.

1099
01:14:35.481 --> 01:14:35.970
Okay?

1100
01:14:40.815 --> 01:14:44.242
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.


1101
01:14:47.418 --> 01:14:49.317
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.


1102
01:14:51.744 --> 01:14:52.443
Okay?

1103
01:15:17.648 --> 01:15:21.174
The neighbors came by. They're
renovating the loft downstairs.


1104
01:15:21.614 --> 01:15:25.570
They had water flooding
from his bathroom down to their place.


1105
01:15:26.748 --> 01:15:31.474
His front door, fire escape, he had
everything locked up pretty good.


1106
01:15:32.243 --> 01:15:35.969
It took our guys ten minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.


1107
01:15:37.577 --> 01:15:39.675
There's pills all over the place.

1108
01:15:41.383 --> 01:15:45.609
Just the scene alone
is pretty definitive for suicide.


1109
01:15:47.078 --> 01:15:48.966
Then I spoke to some
of your partners...


1110
01:15:48.976 --> 01:15:52.202
who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so.


1111
01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:58.306
- Is there a note?
- No. They looked.


1112
01:15:59.215 --> 01:16:02.872
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.


1113
01:16:04.949 --> 01:16:05.968
Can I get in there?

1114
01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:09.135
His place? Not now.
It's sealed.


1115
01:16:10.114 --> 01:16:14.340
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.


1116
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:17.637
I guess she's off in Europe,
but she's got to come in.


1117
01:16:18.216 --> 01:16:21.043
Or the M.E.'s got to come back
with a toxicology report.


1118
01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:24.639
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's got to stay like that.


1119
01:16:25.578 --> 01:16:26.138
Sorry.

1120
01:16:28.915 --> 01:16:29.574
Sure.

1121
01:16:36.747 --> 01:16:37.476
Okay.

1122
01:16:41.912 --> 01:16:46.467
I know your brother. My wife
works the 190 out in Queens.


1123
01:16:48.215 --> 01:16:49.194
I'll tell him hello.

1124
01:16:50.113 --> 01:16:51.632
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.


1125
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.880
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1126
01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.038
Sorry for your loss.

1127
01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:15.068
Michael.

1128
01:17:15.707 --> 01:17:16.147
Jeff.

1129
01:17:16.806 --> 01:17:17.865
This is tough.

1130
01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:19.364
Yeah. He in here?

1131
01:17:31.811 --> 01:17:33.569
Dumb son-of-a-bitch!

1132
01:17:34.448 --> 01:17:35.427
What a thing.

1133
01:17:36.546 --> 01:17:37.835
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, all right.


1134
01:17:39.973 --> 01:17:42.600
I didn't even get
a chance to talk to him.


1135
01:17:43.639 --> 01:17:46.696
That crazy goddam bastard!

1136
01:17:47.675 --> 01:17:49.903
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?


1137
01:17:50.882 --> 01:17:53.339
Marty? I got to set this up.

1138
01:17:53.809 --> 01:17:54.368
Go, go.

1139
01:17:55.477 --> 01:17:56.446
You okay?

1140
01:17:57.815 --> 01:17:58.903
Yeah, I'm fine.

1141
01:18:00.682 --> 01:18:02.040
Come on,
let's get you a drink.


1142
01:18:05.607 --> 01:18:09.972
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?


1143
01:18:09.972 --> 01:18:11.241
Not a chance!

1144
01:18:11.341 --> 01:18:13.329
I just couldn't get
through to him, I couldn't.


1145
01:18:13.339 --> 01:18:16.336
What? You scared him to death?
Come on, the man was a bull.


1146
01:18:16.845 --> 01:18:17.724
Never happened.

1147
01:18:17.744 --> 01:18:19.432
Why does he fold, then?
Why does he?


1148
01:18:22.509 --> 01:18:23.938
It's got to be an accident.

1149
01:18:24.477 --> 01:18:25.866
No. Arthur without a note?

1150
01:18:25.876 --> 01:18:29.203
He couldn't take a piss without leaving
a memo. It has to be an accident.


1151
01:18:29.213 --> 01:18:31.270
I don't get that. I don't
understand that either, though.


1152
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:33.668
One minute he's pumped up,
he's gonna take on the whole world...


1153
01:18:33.678 --> 01:18:36.975
and then twelve hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?


1154
01:18:37.244 --> 01:18:38.034
Why?

1155
01:18:40.211 --> 01:18:43.838
Because people fucking
incomprehensible. Why?


1156
01:18:47.544 --> 01:18:50.631
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1157
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.139
Good years.

1158
01:18:54.707 --> 01:18:57.933
And what I feel right now,
if I'm honest?


1159
01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.538
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1160
01:19:05.176 --> 01:19:06.005
You can say it.

1161
01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:10.600
We caught a lucky break.

1162
01:19:14.277 --> 01:19:15.835
We did, didn't we?

1163
01:19:21.309 --> 01:19:23.897
Marty?
We need to get up to the office.


1164
01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:25.895
They accepted?

1165
01:19:25.905 --> 01:19:29.072
In princ-ple. Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.


1166
01:19:29.771 --> 01:19:32.298
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're a little short on sympathy.


1167
01:19:32.308 --> 01:19:34.236
A U/North is settling?

1168
01:19:34.546 --> 01:19:37.972
They see a window. They wanna try.
What are we gonna do?


1169
01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.007
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.


1170
01:19:46.674 --> 01:19:47.703
It's what we got.

1171
01:19:49.411 --> 01:19:51.469
- You need a ride?
- No, thanks.


1172
01:20:26.173 --> 01:20:28.301
Hello. I'm looking
for Anna Kysersun.


1173
01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:29.740
Who is this?

1174
01:20:30.139 --> 01:20:33.836
Michael Clayton, attorney in New York.
I got your number from Arthur.


1175
01:20:33.836 --> 01:20:35.104
You have got some nerve!

1176
01:20:36.073 --> 01:20:36.833
Excuse me?

1177
01:20:36.942 --> 01:20:40.199
You get her all the way out to New York
City and then leave her at the airport?


1178
01:20:41.338 --> 01:20:45.933
This is a girl who's never been
farther away home than Milwaukee.


1179
01:20:45.943 --> 01:20:48.001
- Wait a minute.
- No, you wait.


1180
01:20:48.141 --> 01:20:52.706
She's coming home tomorrow. And if you
call here again, I'm warning you...


1181
01:20:52.706 --> 01:20:54.674
Are you telling me
she's in New York right now?


1182
01:20:55.244 --> 01:20:57.172
This is a young girl,
do you hear me?


1183
01:20:57.312 --> 01:20:59.300
She's in the city right now?

1184
01:20:59.609 --> 01:21:01.437
What kind of people are you?

1185
01:21:01.777 --> 01:21:04.834
All right, you just stay
on the phone one a second.


1186
01:21:41.107 --> 01:21:41.666
Anna?

1187
01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:45.493
My name's Michael Clayton,
I'm a friend of Arthur's.


1188
01:21:46.342 --> 01:21:48.699
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.


1189
01:21:50.807 --> 01:21:52.036
Please, open the door.

1190
01:22:03.944 --> 01:22:04.833
What are you thinking?

1191
01:22:06.501 --> 01:22:08.130
I don't know.
I'll watch the door.


1192
01:22:08.909 --> 01:22:10.997
You check his car.
Let's get some details.


1193
01:22:14.473 --> 01:22:17.060
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.


1194
01:22:19.808 --> 01:22:22.775
Just that when I got there,
he would pick me up...


1195
01:22:23.804 --> 01:22:25.502
and show me, and I would see...

1196
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:29.468
that is was something
that would win the whole case.


1197
01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.193
Even this morning...

1198
01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:36.061
I mean, I thought:

1199
01:22:38.369 --> 01:22:43.274
"If I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, I'll know.


1200
01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:47.499
You're stupid,
and you can go home now".


1201
01:22:50.906 --> 01:22:55.202
But it was there and he paid,
like 800 dollars...


1202
01:22:56.001 --> 01:22:57.699
for a first-class ticket.

1203
01:22:58.708 --> 01:22:59.467
And I just...

1204
01:23:03.973 --> 01:23:05.331
I got on the plane.

1205
01:23:08.738 --> 01:23:09.827
I believe him.

1206
01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:19.667
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?


1207
01:23:20.975 --> 01:23:24.901
Let's say that he knew that you told
somebody else about all of this...


1208
01:23:24.971 --> 01:23:28.228
and, I don't know, in some crazy
way, he was disappointed by that?


1209
01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.794
- But I didn't.
- You must have told somebody else.


1210
01:23:32.633 --> 01:23:33.333
No.

1211
01:23:35.341 --> 01:23:36.629
He made me promise.

1212
01:23:39.037 --> 01:23:42.693
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?


1213
01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:45.231
No.

1214
01:23:50.875 --> 01:23:53.103
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1215
01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:00.235
190 PRECINT

1216
01:24:06.339 --> 01:24:08.467
- You talking about this?
- Let me see.


1217
01:24:10.934 --> 01:24:12.303
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.


1218
01:24:13.432 --> 01:24:16.429
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.


1219
01:24:16.499 --> 01:24:18.127
Nobody's gonna know
where it came from.


1220
01:24:20.105 --> 01:24:22.593
- Are you that jammed up?
- What are you talking about?


1221
01:24:22.603 --> 01:24:25.629
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?


1222
01:24:25.639 --> 01:24:27.428
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal".


1223
01:24:28.007 --> 01:24:28.986
You really wanna know?

1224
01:25:46.797 --> 01:25:48.355
This just gets better and better.

1225
01:25:50.873 --> 01:25:51.852
What are we doing?

1226
01:27:36.695 --> 01:27:40.931
BESTYPES COPIES - BINDING C.O.D.
LESS 10º% DEPOSIT


1227
01:27:54.267 --> 01:27:56.255
Freeze! Right there, asshole!

1228
01:27:56.994 --> 01:27:57.823
Don't move!

1229
01:27:58.233 --> 01:27:59.991
It's all right, I'm a friend.

1230
01:28:00.301 --> 01:28:02.858
Get your hands up!
Get your hands up, now!


1231
01:28:03.228 --> 01:28:05.256
- What's in your hand?
- It's a book.


1232
01:28:05.266 --> 01:28:07.523
Drop it! Drop it, now!

1233
01:28:08.433 --> 01:28:10.450
Turn around. Slowly.

1234
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:11.330
All right. Okay.

1235
01:28:12.099 --> 01:28:13.557
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.


1236
01:28:13.567 --> 01:28:15.555
- I said who else is here?
- Nobody's here!


1237
01:28:16.634 --> 01:28:17.363
Check in there.

1238
01:28:18.562 --> 01:28:21.429
You move,
I'll take your head off.


1239
01:28:51.599 --> 01:28:54.466
Now I owe this scumbag
and his wife...


1240
01:28:54.466 --> 01:28:57.862
who's a piece of shit in my unit,
I owe them both my balls for this.


1241
01:28:57.862 --> 01:29:00.559
- I'm sorry.
- "Nobody's gonna know it's me".


1242
01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:03.486
You know what happens they don't bury
this, that I gave you this thing?


1243
01:29:03.496 --> 01:29:04.485
I know it's bad.

1244
01:29:05.594 --> 01:29:07.862
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.


1245
01:29:07.862 --> 01:29:10.190
- You made your point.
- It's not a point, Mickey!


1246
01:29:10.529 --> 01:29:13.087
- Who called 911?
- What?


1247
01:29:13.666 --> 01:29:16.463
The building was empty.
I wasn't there very long.


1248
01:29:16.693 --> 01:29:19.120
Who called it in? Does that make
sense to you, this happening like?


1249
01:29:19.130 --> 01:29:20.149
This is never happened.

1250
01:29:22.197 --> 01:29:24.055
You got all these cops
thinking you're a lawyer...


1251
01:29:24.495 --> 01:29:26.263
and you got all these lawyers
thinking you're some kind of cop.


1252
01:29:26.263 --> 01:29:29.130
You got everybody fooled,
don't you? Everybody but you.


1253
01:29:30.529 --> 01:29:31.997
You know exactly what you are.

1254
01:29:46.193 --> 01:29:50.888
We tried calling you like six times.
But your machine must be busted.


1255
01:29:51.967 --> 01:29:53.456
We gave it our best shot.

1256
01:29:53.795 --> 01:29:57.691
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock.


1257
01:29:57.701 --> 01:29:59.220
So we did the other
thousand in blue.


1258
01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:08.990
U/NORTH, CULCITATE,
INTERNAL MEMORANDUM 229


1259
01:30:20.898 --> 01:30:21.917
Is everything all right?

1260
01:30:22.666 --> 01:30:23.725
It's fine, yeah.

1261
01:30:24.494 --> 01:30:27.591
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there...


1262
01:30:27.601 --> 01:30:30.118
Do me a favor,
hang on to them.


1263
01:30:30.668 --> 01:30:33.085
I'll come back and pick
everything up next week, okay?


1264
01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:35.253
Seriously? Thanks, man.

1265
01:31:02.525 --> 01:31:04.923
Don! You go ahead.
I'll catch up to you.


1266
01:31:06.391 --> 01:31:06.921
What?

1267
01:31:14.992 --> 01:31:16.461
Do you know Michael Clayton?

1268
01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:18.259
Yeah, why?

1269
01:31:18.529 --> 01:31:19.788
We have a situation.

1270
01:31:40.866 --> 01:31:42.984
- Did they find you?
- Who?


1271
01:31:42.994 --> 01:31:44.722
Marty. I don't think
they've gone in yet.


1272
01:31:53.563 --> 01:31:54.053
Marty.

1273
01:31:55.461 --> 01:31:58.418
There's way too much going
on for your phone to be off.


1274
01:31:58.428 --> 01:32:00.286
- I need a minute.
- We're late now, so.


1275
01:32:00.296 --> 01:32:01.815
We never got to finish last night.

1276
01:32:02.194 --> 01:32:04.652
What did you do, close the place?
You look like hell.


1277
01:32:04.662 --> 01:32:07.089
- I left right after you left.
- Lf you say so...


1278
01:32:08.228 --> 01:32:10.486
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.


1279
01:32:10.496 --> 01:32:13.223
Jean! I need the thing...
the envelope.


1280
01:32:14.432 --> 01:32:17.359
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.


1281
01:32:17.559 --> 01:32:20.955
I put Bob Nast and Kim.
Probably a mistake.


1282
01:32:20.965 --> 01:32:23.882
They're gonna try a memorial
service by the end of the week.


1283
01:32:23.892 --> 01:32:26.380
I told them to call you
if they need any help, okay?


1284
01:32:27.029 --> 01:32:28.927
No, no. The other one,
the other one.


1285
01:32:30.426 --> 01:32:32.294
So we cut you
a check this morning.


1286
01:32:33.023 --> 01:32:35.620
There's some strings attached.
And Barry...


1287
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:39.357
there's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.


1288
01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:45.760
What if Arthur
was on to something?


1289
01:32:46.889 --> 01:32:48.357
What do you mean?
On to what?


1290
01:32:48.727 --> 01:32:51.354
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?


1291
01:32:51.864 --> 01:32:54.151
That we're on the wrong side?

1292
01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:56.719
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.


1293
01:32:56.729 --> 01:32:59.456
This is news!
This case reeked from day one.


1294
01:32:59.796 --> 01:33:01.954
15 years in, I got to tell you
how we pay the rent?


1295
01:33:02.163 --> 01:33:04.681
But what would they do?
What would they do if he went public?


1296
01:33:04.691 --> 01:33:07.917
What would they do?
They're doing it.


1297
01:33:08.197 --> 01:33:10.785
We don't straighten this settlement
out in the next 24 hours...


1298
01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:12.952
they're gonna withhold
nine million dollars in fees.


1299
01:33:12.962 --> 01:33:16.259
They'll pull out the video of Arthur
doing his flashdance in Milwaukee.


1300
01:33:16.389 --> 01:33:18.187
They're gonna sue us
for legal malpractice.


1301
01:33:18.357 --> 01:33:21.793
Except they won't win 'cause
the merger with London will be dead...


1302
01:33:21.793 --> 01:33:23.721
and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.


1303
01:33:25.290 --> 01:33:26.189
That's $80,000.

1304
01:33:27.428 --> 01:33:28.686
We're calling it a bonus.

1305
01:33:30.125 --> 01:33:33.921
You got a three-year contract.
That's assuming this all works out.


1306
01:33:34.091 --> 01:33:35.220
You're doing this now?

1307
01:33:37.897 --> 01:33:40.254
I agreed to this.
But there's rules now.


1308
01:33:40.354 --> 01:33:43.022
You want the contract, you're signing
a confidentiality agreement.


1309
01:33:43.022 --> 01:33:45.489
It's gonna be bulletproof
and it's gonna be retroactive.


1310
01:33:45.789 --> 01:33:49.125
But with everything
you know about this place...


1311
01:33:49.125 --> 01:33:51.183
and the clients here
and the people who work here...


1312
01:33:51.493 --> 01:33:54.250
it makes it a little weird when you
come in adn ask for $80 grand.


1313
01:33:54.989 --> 01:33:57.787
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come directly to you.


1314
01:33:57.797 --> 01:34:00.384
And it wouldn't be for $80 grand.
Is this him, or is this you?


1315
01:34:00.394 --> 01:34:03.291
- Lf I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.


1316
01:34:03.291 --> 01:34:04.110
So there you go.

1317
01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:06.088
Enough, okay?

1318
01:34:07.127 --> 01:34:09.525
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1319
01:34:09.754 --> 01:34:12.222
And you're on the record.
Everybody happy?


1320
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:15.918
- Don Jeffries is here.
- We're on the way.


1321
01:34:16.987 --> 01:34:20.723
Call Bob Nast. Just see if they
need help with this thing.


1322
01:34:24.729 --> 01:34:25.448
You're welcome!

1323
01:35:18.954 --> 01:35:20.982
You said $12, this is $75.

1324
01:35:21.322 --> 01:35:23.290
Don't get too excited.
You want a drink?


1325
01:35:23.389 --> 01:35:24.978
No. I'm working.

1326
01:35:28.224 --> 01:35:31.052
So, we're square, then.
No bad blood.


1327
01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:33.379
Just doing your job.

1328
01:35:33.589 --> 01:35:34.218
That's right.

1329
01:35:36.286 --> 01:35:37.115
Take it easy, Gabe.

1330
01:35:38.924 --> 01:35:39.483
Michael.

1331
01:35:52.090 --> 01:35:52.580
Check.

1332
01:35:55.257 --> 01:35:55.876
Check.

1333
01:35:56.955 --> 01:35:57.425
Check.

1334
01:35:57.924 --> 01:35:59.323
Half the pot. $200.

1335
01:35:59.593 --> 01:36:00.522
Two hundred to go.

1336
01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:39.412
So what happened with the bar?

1337
01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:42.159
You just had to be a rock star.

1338
01:37:04.926 --> 01:37:07.044
What are you doing?
You just got here.


1339
01:37:07.953 --> 01:37:09.781
Guy plays nine hands,
walk away.


1340
01:37:09.951 --> 01:37:14.117
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?


1341
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:50.609
Get out.

1342
01:37:52.388 --> 01:37:53.407
Get out of the car now.

1343
01:37:56.254 --> 01:37:56.743
Walter?

1344
01:37:56.753 --> 01:37:59.580
Michael.
Thank God you're there.


1345
01:38:03.956 --> 01:38:04.785
You have eight...

1346
01:38:06.723 --> 01:38:08.781
six... five...

1347
01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.908
four... three...

1348
01:38:12.217 --> 01:38:13.376
Get out of the car.

1349
01:38:17.222 --> 01:38:18.411
Tell him to stay off the phone.

1350
01:38:18.921 --> 01:38:20.319
Yeah, but you're on it, right?

1351
01:38:20.859 --> 01:38:21.688
Am I clean?

1352
01:38:22.287 --> 01:38:23.416
Just keep walking.

1353
01:38:23.955 --> 01:38:25.424
You copy? Am I clean?

1354
01:38:26.253 --> 01:38:28.551
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.


1355
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:33.516
Just to let him know you're on the way,
Then I'll get back to you with details.


1356
01:38:33.516 --> 01:38:35.783
- Just give me like two minutes.
- All right. I'll be in the car.


1357
01:38:39.719 --> 01:38:42.477
I didn't finish.
It's in, but I don't know.


1358
01:39:11.117 --> 01:39:12.146
It's loose.

1359
01:39:12.816 --> 01:39:14.614
I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but...


1360
01:39:16.252 --> 01:39:17.621
Let's find a way
to boost the signal.


1361
01:39:25.982 --> 01:39:28.819
- I don't know what Walter promisd you.
- A miracle worker!


1362
01:39:29.519 --> 01:39:33.355
Walter on the phone,

1363
01:39:33.355 --> 01:39:34.813
"Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker".


1364
01:39:34.883 --> 01:39:37.151
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?


1365
01:39:37.151 --> 01:39:39.179
About the fact that you're the firm's
fixer? Or that you're any good at it?


1366
01:39:45.752 --> 01:39:47.650
We're up. Just got a signal.

1367
01:40:11.686 --> 01:40:13.174
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?


1368
01:40:13.784 --> 01:40:14.982
Maybe he's lost.

1369
01:40:15.881 --> 01:40:17.370
- Wait a minute.
- That's him.


1370
01:40:20.657 --> 01:40:21.586
He was alone, right?

1371
01:40:22.155 --> 01:40:23.813
- Yeah, I think so.
- Call it, yes or no?


1372
01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:28.269
We got to turn around.

1373
01:40:59.147 --> 01:40:59.807
Talk to me.

1374
01:41:00.716 --> 01:41:01.945
Now it's strobing.

1375
01:41:03.053 --> 01:41:05.041
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.


1376
01:41:21.185 --> 01:41:22.414
Now he turned.
Somehow he turned.


1377
01:41:22.554 --> 01:41:23.043
Where?

1378
01:41:23.113 --> 01:41:26.520
- He took a left.
- I don't have a left.


1379
01:41:37.618 --> 01:41:38.238
East. He's southeast.

1380
01:41:38.248 --> 01:41:40.076
- So we missed it?
- Or the grid is wrong.


1381
01:41:40.345 --> 01:41:41.115
All right, hang on.

1382
01:41:51.784 --> 01:41:53.582
We got to go back to one.

1383
01:41:53.582 --> 01:41:54.841
Where's our one?

1384
01:41:54.851 --> 01:41:56.409
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.


1385
01:42:04.551 --> 01:42:07.348
It says we're closing. We're green,
but that's west. It cant' be west.


1386
01:42:07.348 --> 01:42:08.647
Is the signal or the grid?

1387
01:42:08.647 --> 01:42:10.705
- Both. It's just keeps dropping out.
- Damn it!


1388
01:43:02.512 --> 01:43:03.311
Give me the cell.

1389
01:43:06.578 --> 01:43:07.477
Our signal's good.

1390
01:44:46.176 --> 01:44:46.835
What?

1391
01:44:49.942 --> 01:44:50.841
Thanks, Mickey.

1392
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:52.899
Just get me out of here.

1393
01:45:01.411 --> 01:45:05.077
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon. I think Thursday at the latest.


1394
01:45:05.077 --> 01:45:08.014
We should have someone from the equity
group there. McDonnell, maybe.


1395
01:45:09.712 --> 01:45:10.371
Did you hear?

1396
01:45:10.711 --> 01:45:13.149
- They closed U/North.
- No, Michael Clayton.


1397
01:45:13.478 --> 01:45:14.068
What?

1398
01:45:14.647 --> 01:45:17.474
Car bomb. Upstate.
This morning. He was killed.


1399
01:45:19.043 --> 01:45:19.632
What?

1400
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:22.599
Holy shit!

1401
01:45:37.544 --> 01:45:42.609
It has been and it remains
the U/North position...


1402
01:45:42.948 --> 01:45:46.375
that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.


1403
01:45:46.744 --> 01:45:53.667
And reinforced by the plaintiffs
demand for settlement...


1404
01:45:53.877 --> 01:45:58.243
in excess
of three billion dollars.


1405
01:45:59.012 --> 01:46:01.310
The reason that
we are all here today is...


1406
01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:06.444
that several key elements
in the case have changed.


1407
01:46:07.413 --> 01:46:11.639
You all have a tentative
proposal packet...


1408
01:46:12.378 --> 01:46:16.105
which outlines the details,
but the bottom lines is this...


1409
01:46:16.744 --> 01:46:19.601
over the past several months
we had gotten word...


1410
01:46:19.611 --> 01:46:21.599
that the plaintiffs
were growing impatient...


1411
01:46:22.148 --> 01:46:26.943
and were in the process of revising
their settlement numbers.


1412
01:46:27.483 --> 01:46:30.570
We also learned
that the plaintiffs attorneys...


1413
01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:33.307
fees were capped at 32º...

1414
01:46:33.307 --> 01:46:35.105
up to $400 million dollars.

1415
01:46:35.715 --> 01:46:39.041
Above which,
their fees dropped to 24%.


1416
01:46:40.210 --> 01:46:44.935
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...


1417
01:46:45.115 --> 01:46:46.044
in the middle there.

1418
01:46:47.073 --> 01:46:47.842
Finally...

1419
01:46:49.041 --> 01:46:53.277
our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...


1420
01:46:53.706 --> 01:46:55.335
and that the tax benefit...

1421
01:46:55.345 --> 01:46:58.401
provided that we bring the settlement
in under 600 million...


1422
01:46:58.611 --> 01:47:00.010
and within this fiscal year...

1423
01:47:01.139 --> 01:47:06.833
that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.


1424
01:47:07.812 --> 01:47:12.247
The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...


1425
01:47:12.477 --> 01:47:16.743
the strongest possible position for
our company, under the circumstances.


1426
01:47:17.142 --> 01:47:18.541
And, as Chief Counsel...

1427
01:47:18.811 --> 01:47:21.638
it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.


1428
01:47:23.706 --> 01:47:27.202
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.


1429
01:47:27.312 --> 01:47:28.900
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1430
01:47:32.207 --> 01:47:32.836
Well...

1431
01:47:56.073 --> 01:47:56.972
How'd it go in there?

1432
01:48:00.838 --> 01:48:02.037
Pretty freaky?

1433
01:48:03.575 --> 01:48:05.873
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.


1434
01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.437
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1435
01:48:13.745 --> 01:48:17.541
You got one of these? It's a great
memo. It's an oldie but a goodie.


1436
01:48:20.748 --> 01:48:22.196
I got your heart racing, don't I?

1437
01:48:22.206 --> 01:48:24.194
I don't know what the hell
it is you think you're doing.


1438
01:48:24.214 --> 01:48:25.433
What do you think I'm doing?

1439
01:48:25.912 --> 01:48:27.171
The suit's over. 
We have a deal.

1440
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.368
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.


1441
01:48:30.877 --> 01:48:34.743
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.


1442
01:48:34.843 --> 01:48:36.741
I didn't realize you'd
signed all those checks.


1443
01:48:37.171 --> 01:48:39.898
That's a drag. I got much of these
things. What am I gonna do with them?


1444
01:48:40.208 --> 01:48:41.367
I'm calling Marty.

1445
01:48:41.377 --> 01:48:44.703
Good, do it.
That's a great place to start.


1446
01:48:44.713 --> 01:48:47.370
Let's find out who told him
that Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.


1447
01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:49.698
Let's find out
who tapped those phones.


1448
01:48:49.708 --> 01:48:53.604
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...


1449
01:48:53.674 --> 01:48:57.071
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.


1450
01:48:57.071 --> 01:48:57.860
I know you killed him.

1451
01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.898
It's a cut-and-dried case
of attorney-client privilege.


1452
01:48:59.908 --> 01:49:02.675
That's just not the way
to go here, Karen.


1453
01:49:03.404 --> 01:49:06.101
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?


1454
01:49:06.871 --> 01:49:08.069
This conversation is over.

1455
01:49:08.139 --> 01:49:11.766
I'm not the guy that you kill,
I'm the guy that you buy!


1456
01:49:11.776 --> 01:49:14.333
Are you so blind you
don't even see what I am?


1457
01:49:14.473 --> 01:49:17.640
I'm the easiest part of your whole
problem and you're gonna kill me?


1458
01:49:18.379 --> 01:49:20.467
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman...


1459
01:49:20.706 --> 01:49:24.972
I do everything from shoplifting
housewives to bent congressmen.


1460
01:49:24.972 --> 01:49:26.101
And you're gonna kill me?

1461
01:49:27.839 --> 01:49:30.167
What do you need, Karen?
Lay it on me!


1462
01:49:31.046 --> 01:49:34.133
You want a carry permit or a heads-up
on an insider trading subpoena?


1463
01:49:34.512 --> 01:49:38.438
I sold out Arthur for 80000 and a three
year contract and you're gonna kill me?


1464
01:49:40.137 --> 01:49:41.126
What do you want?

1465
01:49:41.505 --> 01:49:42.534
What do I want?

1466
01:49:43.204 --> 01:49:44.302
I want more.

1467
01:49:45.541 --> 01:49:46.300
I want out.

1468
01:49:47.279 --> 01:49:50.136
And with this, 
I want everything.

1469
01:49:52.144 --> 01:49:53.074
Is there a number?

1470
01:49:53.143 --> 01:49:54.132
Ten is a number.

1471
01:49:54.912 --> 01:49:56.370
Ten? Ten what?

1472
01:49:59.237 --> 01:50:00.176
Ten million?

1473
01:50:00.935 --> 01:50:04.432
Where do you think I'm gonna
get ten million dollars?


1474
01:50:04.742 --> 01:50:06.040
You know what's great about this?

1475
01:50:06.869 --> 01:50:08.967
Did you read it all the way to the end?
You see who signed it?


1476
01:50:09.776 --> 01:50:12.104
Let's go into that ballroom
and ask Don Jeffries...


1477
01:50:12.104 --> 01:50:13.872
if he wants to pass
the hat for a worthy cause.


1478
01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:18.997
This would have to be
a longer conversation...


1479
01:50:19.007 --> 01:50:21.165
and it would have to take
place somewhere else.


1480
01:50:21.175 --> 01:50:22.194
Where? My car?

1481
01:50:24.801 --> 01:50:25.570
All right.

1482
01:50:26.539 --> 01:50:28.937
I'm gonna make it easy.
Let's make it five.


1483
01:50:29.906 --> 01:50:31.494
Five and I'll forget
about Arthur.


1484
01:50:33.972 --> 01:50:38.667
Five is easier. Yeah, five is something
that we could talk about.


1485
01:50:39.077 --> 01:50:43.162
Good. And then the other five
is to forget about the 468 people...


1486
01:50:43.172 --> 01:50:45.041
that you knocked off
with your weed killer!


1487
01:50:45.370 --> 01:50:47.568
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don.


1488
01:50:47.578 --> 01:50:49.666
Do I look like I'm negotiating?

1489
01:50:50.505 --> 01:50:51.034
Karen?

1490
01:50:52.673 --> 01:50:54.331
- One second.
- Everything okay?


1491
01:50:56.009 --> 01:50:56.469
Yes.

1492
01:50:57.678 --> 01:51:01.764
Ten million dollars. Bank of my
choosing. Offshore. Immediately!


1493
01:51:01.873 --> 01:51:02.773
- Yes.
- Say it!

We're detectives with NY. Come with us

You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

You guys cover
every exit in the back.

Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?


1516
