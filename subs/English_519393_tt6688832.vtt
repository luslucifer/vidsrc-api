2
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.718
In my little heimat,

3
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.180
one can sense similar feelings
to being on an island,


4
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.220
safety, a sense of
security, real or fictional,


5
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.818
and of remoteness.

6
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.838
And the conviction, so pleasing,

7
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.128
that the people who are not
lucky enough to live there


8
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.840
are indeed totally unfortunate.

9
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.568
In my little

10
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.300
the days of Tramuntana
have a magical glare,


11
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.318
the wind swirls possessed out of the earth

12
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.648
and takes the sea away.

13
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.370
The gusts of wind roll
violently against the horizon.


14
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.500
It is a shiny jewel of chaos.

15
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.238
When it comes from the south,

16
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.560
the air becomes extremely humid.

17
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.518
While the wind turns the
leaves of the olive trees


18
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.098
to cover the mountains in a silver glaze,

19
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.020
the clouds appear misty gray.

20
00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.470
The sky seems to
be smelling the wet land,

21
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.460
the sea turns dark, and the thunder howls,

22
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.390
the falling rain announces
abundance, a greenery on earth.


23
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.068
The wind of imagination
swells the sails of thought


24
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.700
and cuts through the water
like the bow of a ship,


25
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.640
as if the present penetrated the future,

26
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.870
leaving behind a trace of anxiety.

27
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.510
What happened to our lives?

28
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.050
None of us had the slightest
premonition of our tragedy.


29
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.290
It was there all the time
and we were unable to see it


30
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.330
while life was so joyfully beautiful.

31
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.320
And now, there is nothing else to tell.

32
00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:17.783
We are very upset.

33
00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:20.118
Mr. Dalí never loved anyone.

34
00:05:21.094 --> 00:05:22.877
Please accept our condolences.

35
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.852
Miss, she is here!

36
00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:41.190
- Ah, hola.
- Hello, Miss Maggie.


37
00:05:41.192 --> 00:05:43.109
Good morning, Arturo.

38
00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.615
Anna Maria.

39
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:47.608
Anna Maria!

40
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.220
I just saw Caminada and his wife.

41
00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:53.139
Arturo is very upset.

42
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.028
The notary just showed them the will.

43
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.030
40 years of faithful
service, he isn't even named.


44
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.198
How are you feeling?

45
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.551
Oh, the leg is better.

46
00:06:07.553 --> 00:06:09.488
But I don't get out of this chair.

47
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.068
Anna Maria.

48
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.558
I never go out.

49
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.620
But it's not good not to go outside.

50
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.218
Where is Josefina?

51
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.918
In bed with fever in Barcelona.

52
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.978
She phones every day.

53
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.228
Well, give her my love.

54
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.258
She's a great woman.

55
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.408
I hope she comes back soon.

56
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.830
Cadaqués is like a drug.

57
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.908
Once you get used to it,

58
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.058
it is impossible to
stay away for too long.


59
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.648
It is a magnetic force
that attracts everyone.


60
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.238
How bizarre.

61
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.930
I came to say how very
sorry I am about Salvador.


62
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.508
Thanks.

63
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.128
You didn't need to come all this way.

64
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.638
John wanted to come,
but he caught a cold.

65
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.768
He's in a hotel in Barcelona.

66
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.248
I rented a car.

67
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.970
Intrepid as ever.

68
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.698
We have lunch here.

69
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.563
Unless I can make you go out.

70
00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.722
Emilia's bought the fish.

71
00:07:10.724 --> 00:07:12.697
I wanted to see you

72
00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:16.198
to talk and laugh like the old days.

73
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.938
Cambridge.

74
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.620
My brother has been buried under
the dome of his own museum.


75
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.570
His last great masterpiece.

76
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.298
Well, they said he spent his last years

77
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.178
preparing his immortality.

78
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.013
Oh, what a man.

79
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.480
Well, it's all over now.

80
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.480
When I think, half our lives
not talking to each other.


81
00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:47.308
Anna Maria.

82
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.768
You have John.

83
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.048
Me...

84
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.935
You have Emilia, and all her family.

85
00:07:53.937 --> 00:07:56.258
And you've had a very full life,

86
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.328
and written some wonderful books.

87
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.210
There was a very high price to pay.

88
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.450
We were all at fault.

89
00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:08.820
Well, perhaps if you had
been a little more flexible.


90
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.018
I don't disagree with you.

91
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.420
We Dalis have stubborn
personalities, the women too.


92
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.808
Like the strong wind.

93
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.890
You're all affected by the Tramuntana.

94
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.758
Franco helped Salvador

95
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.608
to convert the theater of our childhood

96
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.180
into a mecca of contemporary art.

97
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.948
When it opened,

98
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.758
people saw that a lot
of his art was missing.


99
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.280
His last genius invention was overrated.

100
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.380
But it has ended
up being a gold mine.

101
00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:49.658
The Marquess of Dali and Pubol

102
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.290
finally decided to be buried there.

103
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.920
Even though Salvador was so ill,

104
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.100
he wanted to be a
spectator at his own end.


105
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.910
He said "When I die, I
will be totally cured."


106
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.838
Things are never what they seem

107
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.333
but rather the total opposite.

108
00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:14.928
Emília, the diary.

109
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.930
I described everything I saw and heard.

110
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.188
Like in your books.

111
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.658
I've kept them all, though.

112
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.493
Aw.

113
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.868
I wrote about my family,
about people I met,


114
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.630
conversations and anecdotes
that I found amusing.


115
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.848
I never kept it hidden,

116
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.270
and sometimes my brother wrote in it.

117
00:09:41.302 --> 00:09:43.608
But that was long
time ago, before we even met.


118
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.443
Oh yes.

119
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.430
When he was little, Salvador
was such a charming boy.


120
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.640
spoiled but innocent, full of life.

121
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.770
With those piercing eyes
and that old man's smile.


122
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.280
This helps me remember.

123
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.848
May I offer you a drink?

124
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.560
- Emilia...
- No, no, no, gracias.


125
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.850
Figueres was a bright, extrovert town.

126
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.398
Cultured, great intellectual curiosity,

127
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.658
not provincial in the slightest.

128
00:10:31.192 --> 00:10:34.353
Watch how the dancers

129
00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:35.188
count and divide the Sardana steps.

130
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:38.929
These are republicans.

131
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:41.014
The author never ceased
joking about the Borbouns.


132
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:41.849
Great!

133
00:10:43.056 --> 00:10:45.261
In Figueres we have always the best.

134
00:10:45.263 --> 00:10:46.300
Isn't it, Mr. Dalí?

135
00:10:46.302 --> 00:10:47.135
Of course, Mr. Mayor!

136
00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:51.333
You have to learn how to outline

137
00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:53.676
the geometry of music.

138
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.977
Thanks to the Catalan goverment,

139
00:10:56.979 --> 00:10:59.002
all villages have police,

140
00:10:59.004 --> 00:11:02.050
schools, libraries, telephone...

141
00:11:02.052 --> 00:11:03.652
And the road to Cadaqués!

142
00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:06.224
Sure.

143
00:11:06.226 --> 00:11:07.674
And the harbours and technological

144
00:11:07.676 --> 00:11:09.976
teachings for the industry.

145
00:11:20.577 --> 00:11:25.516
Cadaqués was paradise for us
during the summer holidays.


146
00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:29.468
We spent all winter
longing for this light,


147
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.303
these rocks, this sea.

148
00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:36.979
A paradise that's always been with you.

149
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.074
I haven't left it in 50 years.

150
00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:47.076
We settled here for the whole
summer, after the solstice.


151
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.113
When the sea was calm, we
could see our reflections


152
00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:53.520
crystal clear in the water.

153
00:11:56.905 --> 00:12:00.889
Take a good look at the stars.

154
00:12:00.891 --> 00:12:02.289
Do you see the Great Bear?

155
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.408
And the Great Plough?

156
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.241
Look in the middle,

157
00:12:05.243 --> 00:12:06.399
that's the Little Dipper.

158
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:07.234
Ursa Minor.

159
00:12:08.886 --> 00:12:09.717
Hey...

160
00:12:09.719 --> 00:12:11.852
Always look at the sky.

161
00:12:13.302 --> 00:12:15.185
You will know where you are.

162
00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.865
Which ones are from Figueres?

163
00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:41.891
Didn't you leave those so beautiful?

164
00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:49.374
Salvador was my idol.

165
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.743
I was an only child, but I understand.

166
00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:59.127
He was crazy for
cinema when he was little.


167
00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:00.083
All his whole life.

168
00:13:00.085 --> 00:13:01.502
We all were then.

169
00:13:03.037 --> 00:13:05.433
So many projects, so few panned out.

170
00:13:05.435 --> 00:13:10.384
Even though he was so
determined, stubborn as a mule.


171
00:13:10.386 --> 00:13:13.053
He was non-stop, always drawing.

172
00:13:15.697 --> 00:13:18.721
He never missed a day of school.

173
00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:22.118
He had an innate gift for painting.

174
00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:35.508
Good day, Mr. Dalí!

175
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.677
Just working, Mr. Mayor!

176
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.578
One of them is a fake.

177
00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:46.819
This one.

178
00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:51.438
Well done, son!

179
00:13:52.786 --> 00:13:53.617
It is very difficult
to spot it at once.

180
00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.350
The boy has a big future!

181
00:14:04.662 --> 00:14:08.436
At 17, Salvador was
already a star in Figueres.


182
00:14:08.438 --> 00:14:11.177
Father gave him everything.

183
00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:13.382
Salvador always wanted the best paint,

184
00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:16.779
the best canvas, sable brushes.

185
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:19.241
He was very spoiled.

186
00:14:19.243 --> 00:14:20.243
Protected.

187
00:14:21.114 --> 00:14:23.941
We recognized his talent very early on.

188
00:14:23.943 --> 00:14:28.943
Father helped him to exhibit,
the press was very generous.


189
00:14:29.224 --> 00:14:31.455
The Town Hall commissioned
him to make a float


190
00:14:31.457 --> 00:14:33.583
for the Three Kings parade.

191
00:14:33.585 --> 00:14:35.783
His mind was very active.

192
00:14:35.785 --> 00:14:39.952
And so full of joy, oh.

193
00:14:42.384 --> 00:14:44.823
Do you want something, Miss?

194
00:14:44.825 --> 00:14:46.266
No, thanks.

195
00:14:47.203 --> 00:14:48.036
Oh Maggie.

196
00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:55.462
Such times, Maggie.

197
00:14:57.819 --> 00:15:01.152
Salvador so generous, loved by everyone.

198
00:15:07.418 --> 00:15:09.816
And not the slightest notion
of the value of money.


199
00:15:09.818 --> 00:15:11.730
It's hard to believe that, isn't it?

200
00:15:11.732 --> 00:15:14.156
Gala and all those vultures around him

201
00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:16.241
took care of the dollars.

202
00:15:17.326 --> 00:15:20.326
None of us had
any idea of the drama

203
00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:24.126
that was welling up in our family.

204
00:15:24.974 --> 00:15:28.724
You didn't know or
you didn't want to know.


205
00:15:29.706 --> 00:15:31.789
Sometimes it's difficult.

206
00:15:32.837 --> 00:15:33.795
Our mother.

207
00:15:37.095 --> 00:15:37.926
The boy has made a great float

208
00:15:37.928 --> 00:15:39.428
for the cavalcade.

209
00:15:40.859 --> 00:15:43.442
At home, he was always the boy.

210
00:15:45.339 --> 00:15:48.253
Everybody is totally amazed.

211
00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:50.672
In 1921, tragedy embraced us.

212
00:15:57.367 --> 00:16:00.174
When he finished high
school, Father decided


213
00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:04.604
Salvador would study at San
Fernando Academy in Madrid.


214
00:16:04.606 --> 00:16:06.154
If you want to be a painter

215
00:16:06.156 --> 00:16:06.989
there's no need to dress up like that.

216
00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:09.695
He is an artist, father!

217
00:16:09.697 --> 00:16:11.278
In July, neither woman nor snail.

218
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.930
In August, neither woman nor wine.

219
00:16:15.856 --> 00:16:19.435
That was where one qualified
to be a drawing teacher,


220
00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:23.119
a way of being
able to earn a living.

221
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:27.538
And so, the three of us,
Father, Salvador, and myself


222
00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:30.264
set off for Madrid.

223
00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:33.668
Look, all of us in black.

224
00:16:35.237 --> 00:16:37.367
Salvador so dressed up.

225
00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:39.426
What style.

226
00:16:39.428 --> 00:16:44.258
He couldn't, even if he'd
wanted to, go unnoticed.


227
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.260
A genius, egocentric, but
I admired him so much.


228
00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:51.973
What sideburns.

229
00:16:53.249 --> 00:16:56.494
Looks like something
out the '60s.


230
00:16:56.496 --> 00:16:58.724
Now, don't stop talking.

231
00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.625
I like to take photos.

232
00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:02.474
Everyone laughed at us.

233
00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:06.234
You have no idea how embarrassed I was.

234
00:17:06.236 --> 00:17:09.550
Madrid, just such small
provincial mentality.


235
00:17:09.552 --> 00:17:11.321
And when we arrived, we looked as though

236
00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:15.050
we had walked out of an
American gangster movie.


237
00:17:15.052 --> 00:17:17.421
I was afraid people were
going to throw rocks at us.


238
00:17:18.728 --> 00:17:19.699
That's an exaggeration.

239
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:20.778
No, it's true.

240
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.164
Father always said you couldn't
go anywhere with Salvador.


241
00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:27.070
He passed the exam into the Academy,

242
00:17:27.072 --> 00:17:30.822
and he went to live in
the Student Residency.


243
00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:36.994
The much acclaimed Madrid Residency.

244
00:17:36.996 --> 00:17:39.778
He became a star immediately.

245
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.704
Are you sure I can't get
you something to drink?


246
00:17:44.623 --> 00:17:46.787
I feel very lonely but my drawings

247
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:48.380
are very well received.

248
00:17:48.382 --> 00:17:49.696
Pepin Bello showed them

249
00:17:49.698 --> 00:17:52.138
to our companions at the Residency.

250
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.988
I wouldn't have even dared

251
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.369
to take them out of my room.

252
00:17:55.371 --> 00:17:56.936
I have set myself a goal,

253
00:17:56.938 --> 00:17:57.771
I have a very clear idea.

254
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:00.884
My aesthetic ideal.

255
00:18:00.886 --> 00:18:02.867
is to make a painting composed

256
00:18:02.869 --> 00:18:05.103
of both ancient and modern,

257
00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:06.511
merging the art of masters

258
00:18:06.513 --> 00:18:08.272
of Impressionism

259
00:18:08.274 --> 00:18:09.763
and keep the drawing and security

260
00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:11.554
of the ancients,

261
00:18:11.556 --> 00:18:12.962
taking from the moderns

262
00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:14.784
colour and light.

263
00:18:14.786 --> 00:18:16.584
The structure of Cézanne

264
00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:18.578
and Michelangelo.

265
00:18:21.405 --> 00:18:23.344
At 'The Poplar Hill',

266
00:18:23.346 --> 00:18:25.057
as this place is known,

267
00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:27.223
there is an amazing atmosphere,

268
00:18:27.225 --> 00:18:29.265
people from all over Spain.

269
00:18:29.267 --> 00:18:30.823
The majority are liberal,

270
00:18:30.825 --> 00:18:34.031
progressive and anti-monarchy.

271
00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:35.147
That pleases me greatly."

272
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:37.398
But what about the Federalists?

273
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.815
Does he talk about Federalism?

274
00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:40.351
I don't see it.

275
00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:41.542
Or Catalanism?

276
00:18:41.544 --> 00:18:42.936
That neither.

277
00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:45.905
Madrid, Madrid.

278
00:18:45.907 --> 00:18:47.313
Very progressive but...

279
00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:49.172
There's an Andalucian organizing

280
00:18:49.174 --> 00:18:51.676
tremendous poetic competitions,

281
00:18:51.678 --> 00:18:52.509
who also recites, sings

282
00:18:52.511 --> 00:18:55.469
and plays the guitar and piano.

283
00:18:55.471 --> 00:18:58.543
His name is Federico García Lorca

284
00:18:58.545 --> 00:19:00.959
and he is very talented.

285
00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:01.792
There are also some

286
00:19:01.794 --> 00:19:03.462
studying science...

287
00:19:03.464 --> 00:19:05.470
It's like Oxford or Cambridge

288
00:19:05.472 --> 00:19:06.715
but in Madrid!

289
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.438
What a boy...

290
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.724
Look what he says, grandmother!

291
00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:14.209
Sideburns is dead!

292
00:19:17.084 --> 00:19:18.715
He has changed a lot.

293
00:19:18.717 --> 00:19:21.474
Stopping making a fool of himself.

294
00:19:21.476 --> 00:19:22.717
That's an improvement!

295
00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:36.686
And soon there were two beloved
ones missing from our home.


296
00:19:39.273 --> 00:19:42.752
It was not long, and it
was my mother's wish,


297
00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:47.004
before my father married
Aunt Catalina, her sister,


298
00:19:48.047 --> 00:19:50.630
our second dear mother forever.

299
00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:58.018
Luckily, Salvador came
home early that summer.


300
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.937
He was a comfort to me.

301
00:20:02.013 --> 00:20:03.558
Believe me!

302
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.853
The residency...

303
00:20:05.855 --> 00:20:06.878
There is no need

304
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.597
for so much affectation.

305
00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:11.438
We notaries are serious people.

306
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.762
All right, so the residency...

307
00:20:16.597 --> 00:20:18.841
is a totally separate world,

308
00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:23.258
a window to universal culture.

309
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.798
There are magnificent people.

310
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.025
You were very lucky to get in.

311
00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:29.783
Falla, Valle Inclán, 
Ortega y Gasset,

312
00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:30.834
Ors all come there often...

313
00:20:30.836 --> 00:20:32.619
What about San Fernando?

314
00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:33.769
And Unamuno or Machado.

315
00:20:33.771 --> 00:20:35.467
And foreigners.

316
00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:38.009
I've even met Madame Curie.

317
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:39.844
And San Fernando?

318
00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:41.536
San Fernando is a refuge

319
00:20:41.538 --> 00:20:43.560
of conservatives.

320
00:20:43.562 --> 00:20:44.801
They understand nothing

321
00:20:44.803 --> 00:20:45.812
about modern art.

322
00:20:46.881 --> 00:20:50.079
A bunch of putrefying fuddy-duddies.

323
00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:51.839
Fuck, don't say it again!

324
00:20:53.393 --> 00:20:55.208
With Federico we laugh a lot

325
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.162
together...

326
00:20:56.164 --> 00:20:57.820
Why don't you invite him?

327
00:20:57.822 --> 00:20:59.055
He'd like Cadaqués.

328
00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:02.022
That is for sure. 
And Buñuel too.

329
00:21:02.024 --> 00:21:03.352
The one with bad temper?

330
00:21:03.354 --> 00:21:04.743
He studies entomology

331
00:21:04.745 --> 00:21:06.520
and is a great athlete.

332
00:21:06.522 --> 00:21:08.537
He spends all day in the gymnasium.

333
00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:09.930
Or practising the high jump...

334
00:21:09.932 --> 00:21:11.098
Pole vaulting!

335
00:21:12.603 --> 00:21:14.301
He wants to make films?

336
00:21:14.303 --> 00:21:16.192
Yes but he also likes having fun.

337
00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:17.705
A lot.

338
00:21:17.707 --> 00:21:19.063
And surprising people,

339
00:21:19.065 --> 00:21:20.840
and hypnotising.

340
00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:24.751
Sometimes he dresses up

341
00:21:24.753 --> 00:21:25.584
as a beggar...

342
00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:26.419
Come on!

343
00:21:28.195 --> 00:21:29.359
He often goes out

344
00:21:29.361 --> 00:21:31.145
pretending to be poor.

345
00:21:31.147 --> 00:21:32.829
A country town man

346
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:34.492
certainly with lots of money.

347
00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:36.402
I get on much better with Lorca.

348
00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:40.237
He's more genuine.

349
00:21:40.239 --> 00:21:42.058
Bring him here.

350
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.683
He is always writing.

351
00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:46.135
Poetry, and above all theatre.

352
00:21:47.352 --> 00:21:48.709
He is in Granada with his family.

353
00:21:58.695 --> 00:22:03.478
I am the man-of-the-rocks!

354
00:22:29.783 --> 00:22:33.783
Just here, looking at the
brightness of our sea.


355
00:22:36.695 --> 00:22:39.945
I spent countless hours without moving,

356
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.624
in the pose he'd asked me to take,

357
00:22:45.626 --> 00:22:48.668
gazing into the middle distance.

358
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.337
Oh, my dear, you were the
model for his greatest work.


359
00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:56.942
Who else can possibly say that?

360
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.030
Nature in its purest state!

361
00:23:18.032 --> 00:23:19.834
Long live Cadaqués!

362
00:23:19.836 --> 00:23:22.440
Long live Cap de Creus!

363
00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:24.254
Long live Freedom!

364
00:23:24.256 --> 00:23:28.639
Long live the artists' full air!

365
00:23:53.591 --> 00:23:55.132
When are you leaving?

366
00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.935
Summer will soon be over.

367
00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:07.477
I was in his world.

368
00:24:10.325 --> 00:24:12.908
I felt I shared his experience.

369
00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:17.869
That's what you told me in Cambridge.

370
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.104
And 1923, the winter of the great upset.

371
00:24:25.106 --> 00:24:27.371
Oh God, when he was
expelled from the Academy.


372
00:24:27.373 --> 00:24:28.955
Precisely.

373
00:24:28.957 --> 00:24:30.707
Oh, such a scandal.

374
00:24:31.616 --> 00:24:35.502
Salvador had become very
popular in artistic circles


375
00:24:35.504 --> 00:24:40.337
in Madrid, his work was
magnificent, and very appreciated.


376
00:24:42.404 --> 00:24:44.652
At home, we couldn't
understand what had happened.


377
00:24:44.654 --> 00:24:45.487
Hmm.

378
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.405
Outraged by the results of the exams,

379
00:24:50.407 --> 00:24:53.034
some of us left the hall

380
00:24:53.036 --> 00:24:54.341
before the President finished

381
00:24:54.343 --> 00:24:56.181
his ridiculous speech.

382
00:24:56.183 --> 00:24:58.214
The spark that set off the uproar

383
00:24:58.216 --> 00:25:00.791
amongst a group of students in the street.

384
00:25:02.242 --> 00:25:04.531
We stopped the trams.

385
00:25:04.533 --> 00:25:07.807
The police came to break us up.

386
00:25:07.809 --> 00:25:09.531
All the students took part

387
00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:10.767
in the uprising.

388
00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:12.683
They falsely accused me

389
00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:14.502
of being the instigator.

390
00:25:17.218 --> 00:25:19.623
I denied, they wanted me to betray

391
00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:21.055
my companions

392
00:25:21.057 --> 00:25:23.818
but this I would never do so!

393
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.919
We were expelled from the academy

394
00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:27.759
just for expressing an opinion!

395
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:29.461
Is that so important?

396
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.144
Let them wait,

397
00:25:32.146 --> 00:25:34.014
this has just begun.

398
00:25:34.016 --> 00:25:36.307
We protested in front of the Ministry.

399
00:25:36.309 --> 00:25:39.223
That bunch of old farts

400
00:25:39.225 --> 00:25:41.912
at San Fernando are terrified.

401
00:25:41.914 --> 00:25:44.678
They will get a right inspection

402
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.938
and we'll see who wins.

403
00:25:48.365 --> 00:25:50.073
This son of mine is nuts!

404
00:25:52.348 --> 00:25:55.037
I've signed up at the Free Academy.

405
00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:59.254
I will paint nudes and whatever I want.

406
00:25:59.256 --> 00:26:01.420
I have done some amazing portraits,

407
00:26:01.422 --> 00:26:04.405
the first ones are of Lorca and Buñuel.

408
00:26:04.407 --> 00:26:06.290
I am getting a lot of requests...

409
00:26:08.496 --> 00:26:09.603
I can't leave the notary

410
00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:11.091
with such work.

411
00:26:11.093 --> 00:26:12.366
Someone has to go to Madrid

412
00:26:12.368 --> 00:26:14.011
to put an end to this nonsense.

413
00:26:14.013 --> 00:26:15.936
If you want and if it is necessary.

414
00:26:15.938 --> 00:26:17.969
You may start packing.

415
00:26:17.971 --> 00:26:19.060
I will call whoever to know

416
00:26:19.062 --> 00:26:20.587
whom you have to speak to.

417
00:26:20.589 --> 00:26:22.203
He doesn't realise that he's doing.

418
00:26:22.205 --> 00:26:23.780
He is threatening his future.

419
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.127
Thank you, Emilia.

420
00:26:31.129 --> 00:26:34.522
I'll send them all from London.

421
00:26:34.524 --> 00:26:37.642
Aunt Catalina went straight to Madrid,

422
00:26:37.644 --> 00:26:39.802
and soon she was able to reassure us.

423
00:26:39.804 --> 00:26:44.466
She wrote that Salvador's
work was highly valued


424
00:26:44.468 --> 00:26:46.632
by people of sound judgment

425
00:26:46.634 --> 00:26:50.216
and that they understood
his actions.


426
00:26:50.218 --> 00:26:51.146
Oh.

427
00:26:51.148 --> 00:26:53.028
Would you like to have a rest?

428
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:53.863
No, no.

429
00:26:54.922 --> 00:26:56.243
No, I swallowed something.

430
00:26:56.245 --> 00:26:57.452
It went down the wrong way.

431
00:26:57.454 --> 00:26:59.315
No, I'm fine.

432
00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:01.691
Catalina cheered us up

433
00:27:01.693 --> 00:27:04.923
when she said that
Salvador had become famous


434
00:27:04.925 --> 00:27:09.925
for standing up to the
ultra-conservatives of San Fernando.


435
00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:14.540
We went on a trip to Toledo.

436
00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:16.740
You should have seen him prostrate

437
00:27:16.742 --> 00:27:19.876
in front of one of Greco's paintings.

438
00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:23.084
He just doesn't stop doing

439
00:27:23.086 --> 00:27:25.159
his own thing!

440
00:27:27.084 --> 00:27:27.921
Father!

441
00:27:27.923 --> 00:27:29.984
Bad things, out of the womb!

442
00:27:29.986 --> 00:27:31.534
Piss clear, shit strong

443
00:27:31.536 --> 00:27:33.611
and do not fear death.

444
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.751
They came back to Cadaques together.

445
00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:52.793
He was always shut away, painting.

446
00:27:52.795 --> 00:27:56.045
He painted without stopping, endlessly.

447
00:27:57.347 --> 00:27:59.041
He didn't even come out to eat?

448
00:27:59.043 --> 00:28:00.995
We didn't dare disturb him.

449
00:28:00.997 --> 00:28:02.106
Are you hungry?

450
00:28:02.108 --> 00:28:04.673
It's early, we're in Catalonia.

451
00:28:04.675 --> 00:28:07.521
Fish only takes a moment to cook.

452
00:28:07.523 --> 00:28:11.590
That winter, he was
reinstated in San Fernando.


453
00:28:11.592 --> 00:28:12.423
I was happy.

454
00:28:12.425 --> 00:28:14.675
He had to repeat
the year, not so bad.

455
00:28:14.677 --> 00:28:17.176
Well, at least that saved the situation.

456
00:28:17.178 --> 00:28:20.761
- And then in '25?
- '25 was a wonderful year.


457
00:28:23.055 --> 00:28:25.368
The year you met Federico.

458
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.870
The great Lorca.

459
00:28:29.158 --> 00:28:29.991
Oh.

460
00:28:31.027 --> 00:28:32.027
What a fish.

461
00:28:45.222 --> 00:28:46.053
My family are waiting for us

462
00:28:46.055 --> 00:28:47.712
in the village.

463
00:28:47.714 --> 00:28:49.130
They have gone to open up the house.

464
00:28:50.202 --> 00:28:51.343
It's been shut up all winter.

465
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.579
Is it further?

466
00:28:54.581 --> 00:28:56.339
Half an hour.

467
00:28:57.812 --> 00:28:59.745
The road is new.

468
00:28:59.747 --> 00:29:00.715
What?

469
00:29:00.717 --> 00:29:02.491
The road is new.

470
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:05.986
Until recently you came by trap.

471
00:29:05.988 --> 00:29:07.110
Or on a mule.

472
00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:09.196
Six hours if a bandit didn't attack you.

473
00:29:11.493 --> 00:29:12.841
Many people from Cadaqués

474
00:29:12.843 --> 00:29:14.218
traded with Italy,

475
00:29:15.968 --> 00:29:17.714
Havana or Boston,

476
00:29:17.716 --> 00:29:19.557
and never set foot in Figueres.

477
00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:21.451
Sailing by sea was much easier.

478
00:29:22.864 --> 00:29:24.866
It seems like a folk tale.

479
00:29:24.868 --> 00:29:26.993
The phylloxera ruined everything.

480
00:29:26.995 --> 00:29:28.069
Phylloxera?

481
00:29:28.071 --> 00:29:29.285
A plague arrived from France.

482
00:29:29.287 --> 00:29:31.502
It destroyed all the vinyards.

483
00:29:31.504 --> 00:29:32.879
That was all farmland.

484
00:29:35.487 --> 00:29:36.685
The phylloxera brought ruin.

485
00:29:36.687 --> 00:29:37.839
Half the village emigrated.

486
00:29:37.841 --> 00:29:38.772
Where?

487
00:29:38.774 --> 00:29:41.041
To Cuba or where they could.

488
00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:46.900
In Cadaqués life is very hard.

489
00:29:46.902 --> 00:29:48.651
There is nothing there.

490
00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:51.413
For me it is a paradise.

491
00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:54.207
Even Leonardo couldn't have drawn better.

492
00:29:56.849 --> 00:29:59.497
My friend Federico. 
I told you about him.

493
00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:01.011
He is very republican.

494
00:30:01.013 --> 00:30:02.912
The famous Federico!

495
00:30:02.914 --> 00:30:04.819
It is about time we met you.

496
00:30:04.821 --> 00:30:06.104
Welcome!

497
00:30:07.655 --> 00:30:09.236
A great pleasure, Mr. Dalí.

498
00:30:09.238 --> 00:30:10.973
I hope the weather will be good.

499
00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:12.406
The tramuntana might start blowing.

500
00:30:12.408 --> 00:30:14.050
Not too much, a little.

501
00:30:14.052 --> 00:30:15.625
It's the wind from the North.

502
00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:17.259
Don't bother him, auntie.

503
00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:18.717
Don't worry about your luggage,

504
00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:20.844
the servant will take it to your room.

505
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:23.904
I hope you've got a good appetite.

506
00:30:28.468 --> 00:30:31.704
I shall never forget that day.

507
00:30:31.706 --> 00:30:34.539
We laughed so much during the meal

508
00:30:35.526 --> 00:30:38.573
that by the pudding, we were old friends,

509
00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:40.528
as if we had always known
each other all our lives.


510
00:30:45.976 --> 00:30:49.018
As we were arriving I don't know...

511
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.984
the Empordà fascinated me,

512
00:30:52.986 --> 00:30:54.544
it is so beautiful...

513
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:56.851
It reminds me the fields in my Granada.

514
00:30:56.853 --> 00:30:58.234
I knew you would like it,

515
00:30:58.236 --> 00:31:00.042
but you haven't seen anything yet.

516
00:31:00.044 --> 00:31:01.508
You're missing Empuries,

517
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.193
the Greek colony and Girona.

518
00:31:05.844 --> 00:31:07.975
The trembling plain

519
00:31:07.977 --> 00:31:09.819
under a delirium of blue mist.

520
00:31:10.944 --> 00:31:11.775
And your curls

521
00:31:11.777 --> 00:31:13.729
like the Archangel Gabriel.

522
00:31:19.842 --> 00:31:21.448
Now you are going to meet

523
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.856
some real angels.

524
00:31:22.858 --> 00:31:26.589
A sacred public secret.

525
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:27.422
What?

526
00:31:27.424 --> 00:31:28.257
Surprise.

527
00:31:29.383 --> 00:31:31.321
Cover your eyes with your hands.

528
00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:33.648
That is an order.

529
00:31:35.251 --> 00:31:36.799
Let me take you there,

530
00:31:36.801 --> 00:31:38.167
that way you can't cheat.

531
00:31:58.766 --> 00:31:59.597
So?

532
00:31:59.599 --> 00:32:01.266
What do you think?

533
00:32:02.523 --> 00:32:04.131
Beautiful.

534
00:32:05.052 --> 00:32:06.700
Isn't it?

535
00:32:06.702 --> 00:32:08.133
A relic.

536
00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:10.379
Outstanding, but a relic.

537
00:32:10.381 --> 00:32:12.546
Like most ancient art,

538
00:32:12.548 --> 00:32:14.363
four holier-than-thous....

539
00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:15.198
It's fascinating, Salvador.

540
00:32:16.547 --> 00:32:18.519
The Easter Mass must be amazing.

541
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:21.737
I didn't bring you to waste your time.

542
00:32:22.803 --> 00:32:24.059
You don't know how magical

543
00:32:24.061 --> 00:32:25.075
Catholic rites are.

544
00:32:25.077 --> 00:32:25.908
I am only interested

545
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.883
in the mystical part of the sacrifice.

546
00:32:27.885 --> 00:32:29.226
Very well, Salvador.

547
00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.812
My friend, you are a Christian storm

548
00:32:32.814 --> 00:32:36.556
in need of my paganism.

549
00:32:38.346 --> 00:32:39.179
Hmm.

550
00:32:40.749 --> 00:32:44.622
He painted endless
portraits of me at that time.


551
00:32:44.624 --> 00:32:49.048
Studies of my hair falling
over my bare shoulders.


552
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.800
He painted patiently, tirelessly.

553
00:32:53.261 --> 00:32:56.844
I never got bored with
being still, silent.


554
00:32:58.844 --> 00:33:00.392
It is like a landscape

555
00:33:00.394 --> 00:33:02.278
from the Holy Land.

556
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.246
Eternal and current, almost perfect.

557
00:33:06.324 --> 00:33:07.613
These olive trees

558
00:33:07.615 --> 00:33:08.731
give me a sense of well-being.

559
00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:11.830
They are a return to nature,

560
00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:14.764
construction and the architecture

561
00:33:14.766 --> 00:33:16.164
of the landscape.

562
00:33:16.166 --> 00:33:17.641
Cézanne's great ambition.

563
00:33:18.807 --> 00:33:21.998
I don't want anything else.

564
00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:24.764
Olive trees of Cadaqués.

565
00:33:24.766 --> 00:33:25.958
How marvellous!

566
00:33:27.236 --> 00:33:29.144
Baroque body and grey soul.

567
00:33:33.564 --> 00:33:36.538
The lizard is crying.

568
00:33:38.264 --> 00:33:41.517
The she-lizard is crying.

569
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.608
The lizard and the she-lizard

570
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.871
with little white aprons.

571
00:33:45.873 --> 00:33:47.179
They have lost by accident

572
00:33:47.181 --> 00:33:48.581
their wedding ring.

573
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.252
Oh, their little ring of lead!

574
00:33:53.806 --> 00:33:55.381
Oh, their little leaded ring!

575
00:33:58.213 --> 00:34:00.177
A big sky without people

576
00:34:00.179 --> 00:34:02.704
rides the birds in its globe.

577
00:34:05.132 --> 00:34:07.132
Ole, Federiquito, ole.

578
00:34:09.279 --> 00:34:13.862
I close my eyes and I can
see him in the olive grove.


579
00:34:16.627 --> 00:34:18.110
You were...

580
00:34:18.112 --> 00:34:19.653
I was happy.

581
00:34:19.655 --> 00:34:21.083
Why don't we go for a stroll?

582
00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:23.002
I don't want to see people.

583
00:34:23.004 --> 00:34:26.570
Anna Maria, just to stretch your legs.

584
00:34:30.092 --> 00:34:32.016
You have a car.

585
00:34:32.018 --> 00:34:36.268
I go through life either
in first class or third,


586
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.758
but never in second.

587
00:35:13.354 --> 00:35:14.185
They look nice here.

588
00:35:14.187 --> 00:35:17.437
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh Anna Maria.


589
00:35:18.898 --> 00:35:22.815
See you soon, father!

590
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.845
Stop it, Maggie.

591
00:35:29.847 --> 00:35:33.817
John is going to love these.

592
00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:36.852
I'll send copies to Josefina as well.

593
00:35:36.854 --> 00:35:40.604
Salvador painted this,
over and over again.


594
00:35:42.535 --> 00:35:45.035
My brother was a born painter,

595
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.345
just as Lorca was a born poet.

596
00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:51.992
It was their destiny.

Bravo.

614
00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.583
- Bravo.
- Bravo.


615
00:36:43.585 --> 00:36:44.446
Bravo.

616
00:36:44.448 --> 00:36:46.980
In the music of dawn

617
00:36:46.982 --> 00:36:49.775
my burdened heart

618
00:36:49.777 --> 00:36:51.758
aches from its loves

619
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.851
and dreams of distances.

620
00:36:55.174 --> 00:36:57.372
Dawn's light brings

621
00:36:57.374 --> 00:36:59.472
seedbeds of longings

622
00:36:59.474 --> 00:37:01.530
and the eyeless sadness

623
00:37:01.532 --> 00:37:04.542
of the core of my soul...

624
00:37:04.544 --> 00:37:07.499
What would I do in these fields

625
00:37:07.501 --> 00:37:09.634
collecting nests and twigs,

626
00:37:10.534 --> 00:37:12.540
surrounded by the aurore

627
00:37:12.542 --> 00:37:14.760
and the soul filled by night!

628
00:37:14.762 --> 00:37:17.451
What would I do
if I had your eyes

629
00:37:17.453 --> 00:37:18.896
dead to the clear light

630
00:37:18.898 --> 00:37:21.862
and if my flesh
did not have to feel

631
00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:24.547
the heat of your gaze!

632
00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:36.385
His poems are unforgettable.

633
00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:42.538
He was a mischievous,
helpless, and fragile creature.


634
00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:46.693
Anna Maria.

635
00:41:03.978 --> 00:41:06.998
Isn't Tudela where the Club Med is?

636
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.833
Yes, an desecration.

637
00:41:11.216 --> 00:41:13.383
What a disaster.

638
00:41:13.385 --> 00:41:15.287
It must have been so beautiful.

639
00:41:18.985 --> 00:41:23.985
You know, I have no idea
what they talked about together


640
00:41:24.351 --> 00:41:25.434
all the time.

641
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.760
I don't even know if Salvador
had the faintest idea


642
00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:35.524
that these ancient rocks

643
00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:38.859
would continue to inhabit his paintings,

644
00:41:40.392 --> 00:41:43.277
even his most innovative work.

645
00:41:43.279 --> 00:41:45.678
Well, perhaps they
spoke of other things.


646
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.180
Federico was elegance
personified, such eyes, voice.


647
00:41:51.336 --> 00:41:54.899
- He obviously captivated you.
- All of us.


648
00:41:54.901 --> 00:41:59.901
Salvador and Federico, so
different, but getting on so well.


649
00:42:00.336 --> 00:42:03.045
They were more than friends,
they were like brothers.


650
00:42:03.047 --> 00:42:06.168
They loved each other so much.

651
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.755
Perhaps one more than the other.

652
00:42:09.757 --> 00:42:11.761
Well, in a few years,

653
00:42:11.763 --> 00:42:15.596
it became apparent that
the love was a mirage.


654
00:42:17.231 --> 00:42:19.950
I have the keys to this house.

655
00:42:19.952 --> 00:42:22.948
Let's go in, wait till
you see the terrace.


656
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:24.432
What does that mean?

657
00:42:24.434 --> 00:42:26.767
Um, enough, I have enough.

658
00:42:28.465 --> 00:42:30.499
That's a double meaning.

659
00:43:27.175 --> 00:43:29.201
Look what became of the shack.

660
00:43:29.203 --> 00:43:31.334
The house of the eggs.

661
00:43:31.336 --> 00:43:34.634
Ever since he went to Pubol,

662
00:43:34.636 --> 00:43:37.053
God knows what's left inside.

663
00:43:37.995 --> 00:43:39.558
What do you mean?

664
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.065
A certain someone

665
00:43:41.067 --> 00:43:44.900
took absolutely everything
he wanted to Paris.


666
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.473
But wasn't
anybody to control this?


667
00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:56.891
It was a way to swell the
coffers of the black market.


668
00:43:56.893 --> 00:44:00.257
Cadaques lives up to its
reputation for smuggling


669
00:44:00.259 --> 00:44:01.943
and double dealing.

670
00:44:01.945 --> 00:44:05.351
One day flocks of people
will be coming here in coaches.


671
00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:10.366
When Salvador heard of Lorca's murder,

672
00:44:14.562 --> 00:44:16.562
do you know what he did?

673
00:44:18.596 --> 00:44:20.096
He shouted, "Ole."

674
00:44:21.524 --> 00:44:24.714
- Oh good lord.
- It was disgusting.


675
00:44:24.716 --> 00:44:27.716
And then he tried to justify himself

676
00:44:29.036 --> 00:44:32.869
saying that it was a typical Spanish term

677
00:44:32.871 --> 00:44:36.371
that people used to scream at bullfighters

678
00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.415
after a brilliant pass.

679
00:44:39.417 --> 00:44:42.507
In other words, Lorca, with
his obsession with death,


680
00:44:42.509 --> 00:44:44.676
had fulfilled his destiny.

681
00:44:46.189 --> 00:44:49.272
Oh, my lord, what a dreadful thing.

682
00:45:56.195 --> 00:45:57.767
Sardines.

683
00:45:57.769 --> 00:46:00.186
Oh lord, why was he so cruel?

684
00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.024
I'm sorry to say so,

685
00:46:04.026 --> 00:46:08.276
but certain things even a
genius can't be forgiven.


686
00:46:09.878 --> 00:46:12.045
Well, he was who he was.

687
00:46:14.762 --> 00:46:18.512
He even revealed that
it was public knowledge


688
00:46:19.516 --> 00:46:22.462
that Federico was in love with him.

689
00:46:22.464 --> 00:46:23.638
He did?

690
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.794
Oh, my lord.

691
00:46:24.796 --> 00:46:27.710
He said Federico had even tried

692
00:46:27.712 --> 00:46:32.379
to have relations with him,
but because he wasn't queer,


693
00:46:35.554 --> 00:46:39.386
it hurt too much and they didn't continue.

694
00:46:39.388 --> 00:46:41.901
It didn't work, technically.

695
00:46:41.903 --> 00:46:45.313
Well, he could say
some very harsh things.


696
00:46:45.315 --> 00:46:49.000
His megalomania always
urged on, of course, by Gala,


697
00:46:49.002 --> 00:46:52.745
who took pleasure in
complicating everything.


698
00:46:52.747 --> 00:46:54.330
She was unbearable.

699
00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:00.363
Well, if I were in a charitable
mood, which I never am,


700
00:47:00.365 --> 00:47:01.904
I would say she was a monster.

701
00:47:03.149 --> 00:47:06.316
She told Pitxot it was because of me

702
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.504
they threw stones at her in the street.

703
00:47:10.506 --> 00:47:12.589
How could she say that?

704
00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:15.224
Did they really?

705
00:47:15.226 --> 00:47:20.006
Well, some stones may
occasionally have been thrown.


706
00:47:20.008 --> 00:47:21.508
Small town gossip.

707
00:47:22.441 --> 00:47:25.068
Your brother could be very amusing.

708
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.987
Oh, I don't deny that,
extremely amusing, ha.


709
00:47:34.422 --> 00:47:37.589
Ooh, it's getting cold, let's go home.

710
00:47:39.838 --> 00:47:42.171
Good bye, house of delirium.

711
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:31.107
Bravo, bravo, bravo, Federiquito.

712
00:51:56.222 --> 00:52:00.911
And that evening, the first
reading of Mariana Pineda


713
00:52:00.913 --> 00:52:03.641
took place in our house

714
00:54:43.597 --> 00:54:46.179
Oh!

715
00:54:46.181 --> 00:54:47.014
Oh!

716
00:54:48.072 --> 00:54:48.905
Oh.

717
00:55:28.746 --> 00:55:31.526
Were you really in love with Federico?

718
00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:33.361
Well, perhaps I was.

719
00:55:37.085 --> 00:55:39.223
I was very young.

720
00:55:39.225 --> 00:55:41.774
Was it possible for anyone

721
00:55:41.776 --> 00:55:44.672
to be indifferent to Federico's charm?

722
00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:48.226
My father gathered some
friends together in Figueres


723
00:55:48.228 --> 00:55:51.068
for a second reading of Mariana Pineda.

724
00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.550
On the eve of his departure,
we gave a banquet for him,


725
00:55:53.552 --> 00:55:56.310
and my father paid for
the sardana dancing.


726
00:55:56.312 --> 00:55:57.498
Sardanas?

727
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.333
Oh, how lovely of him.

728
00:57:41.515 --> 00:57:45.165
Our Andalusian friend
sealed his friendship


729
00:57:45.167 --> 00:57:48.610
with the Catalans, a deep relationship

730
00:57:48.612 --> 00:57:51.331
with the best of our intelligentsia.

731
00:59:10.206 --> 00:59:13.716
Father was delighted to
collect all the articles


732
00:59:13.718 --> 00:59:16.168
about my brother, but he was concerned.

733
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:20.955
He knew that Salvador was
skipping classes at San Fernando.


734
00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:23.775
Well, he'd written about it in his book.

735
00:59:23.777 --> 00:59:25.688
It was very amusing.

736
00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:29.107
Salvador made a very Trojan horse entry

737
00:59:30.532 --> 00:59:32.652
into the art world.

738
00:59:32.654 --> 00:59:35.735
He was planting the
seeds for his legend.


739
00:59:35.737 --> 00:59:37.747
He was very cunning.

740
00:59:37.749 --> 00:59:39.690
As cunning as could be.

741
00:59:39.692 --> 00:59:40.525
Hmm.

742
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.985
Salvador had Barcelona at his feet,

743
01:00:43.987 --> 01:00:47.628
but he could think of nothing but Paris.

744
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:50.830
He really wanted to see the Louvre.

745
01:00:50.832 --> 01:00:53.819
It's the mecca for young painters.

746
01:00:53.821 --> 01:00:58.196
So father paid for the trip,
a short, four or five days,


747
01:00:58.198 --> 01:01:02.198
on condition that Catalina
and I went with him.


748
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.450
Bunuel met us at the Gare d'Austerlitz.

749
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:10.998
So that was where you met him?

750
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.555
Bunuel took us to the
cafes in Montmartre,


751
01:01:14.557 --> 01:01:17.140
Le Dome, Le Select, La Rotonde.

752
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:21.799
Amazing, overflowing
with interesting people.


753
01:01:25.706 --> 01:01:29.243
Paris, City of Light.

754
01:01:29.245 --> 01:01:33.218
Bunuel took Salvador to meet Picasso,

755
01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:37.014
who hardly paid him any attention at all.

756
01:01:37.016 --> 01:01:40.115
And he was very sorry to
miss Miro, who was away.


757
01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:42.064
- Bad luck.
- Oh, more than that.


758
01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:44.507
Miro was the only one

759
01:01:44.509 --> 01:01:47.646
who was already in the Surrealist group.

760
01:01:47.648 --> 01:01:52.634
And that was what Salvador
talked about most with Bunuel.


761
01:01:52.636 --> 01:01:57.131
And then, we made a quick
trip to Brussels and Bruges.


762
01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:00.558
He really wanted to see the Vermeer,

763
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.560
the greatest painter who ever lived.

764
01:02:07.212 --> 01:02:09.795
Ooh, it was an exhausting trip.

765
01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:13.084
That was some four days.

766
01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:18.913
Lorca and I wrote to each
other endlessly, lovely things.


767
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.448
He even dedicated a song to me.

768
01:03:23.982 --> 01:03:28.547
All he could think about was
shutting himself away to paint


769
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:29.966
here in Cadaques.

770
01:03:31.397 --> 01:03:35.136
I, the girl at the window, had become...

771
01:03:35.138 --> 01:03:38.141
An emerging Empordian Venus.

772
01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:46.602
Federico stayed in Granada that summer.

773
01:03:46.604 --> 01:03:48.385
He wrote to us both.

774
01:03:48.387 --> 01:03:50.488
He dreamt of joining us.

775
01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:52.990
He sent the Ode to my brother.

776
01:04:31.675 --> 01:04:35.291
There was an explosion of life inside him

777
01:04:35.293 --> 01:04:38.599
that never ceased to amaze me.

778
01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:43.434
He was never satisfied, convinced
that his sense of beauty


779
01:04:44.606 --> 01:04:48.606
was much greater than his
ability to project it.


780
01:07:23.905 --> 01:07:28.322
Margarita Xirgu, great lady,
had very good instincts.


781
01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:33.743
But her production was
not completely understood.


782
01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:40.565
It didn't quite capture
the spirit of the play.


783
01:07:40.567 --> 01:07:43.302
You don't have to remind me.

784
01:07:43.304 --> 01:07:45.342
I have a memory like an elephant.

785
01:07:45.344 --> 01:07:48.283
In fact, elephants often consult me.

786
01:07:48.285 --> 01:07:53.203
Some people were extremely
enthusiastic, not many.


787
01:07:53.205 --> 01:07:55.292
Theater is very difficult.

788
01:07:55.294 --> 01:07:57.049
You have to be patient.

789
01:07:57.051 --> 01:08:01.182
Federico had established
himself with the Catalans.


790
01:08:01.184 --> 01:08:03.999
But only as a poet and a playwright.

791
01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:06.799
I mean, his drawings were magnificent.

792
01:08:06.801 --> 01:08:11.218
In this country you can
be one thing and that's it.


793
01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.708
Salvador's paintings at this time

794
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:17.877
were the reflection of a healthy soul.

795
01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:24.805
They were bright, classical,
before he was tainted


796
01:08:26.962 --> 01:08:30.295
with the breath of doctrinal surrealism.

797
01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:34.807
Overseas dealers started to arrive,

798
01:08:34.809 --> 01:08:38.327
and Bread Basket was acquired
by the museum in Pittsburgh.


799
01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:39.496
Now it's taps.

800
01:08:40.489 --> 01:08:41.792
Taps?

801
01:08:41.794 --> 01:08:43.402
Oh, how delicious.

802
01:08:43.404 --> 01:08:45.904
But, I'm sorry, 
I'm on a diet.

803
01:08:47.053 --> 01:08:50.720
Oh, but we bought
them especially for you.


804
01:08:52.547 --> 01:08:54.053
Take them for John.

805
01:08:54.055 --> 01:08:56.739
John will be delighted.

806
01:08:56.741 --> 01:09:00.202
I'm only sorry I didn't
bring anything for Josefina.


807
01:09:00.204 --> 01:09:01.804
Don't worry, she'll understand.

808
01:09:01.806 --> 01:09:04.488
I'm glad she is such a good companion,

809
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.117
and such a clever woman.

810
01:09:07.119 --> 01:09:09.133
And you have John.

811
01:09:09.135 --> 01:09:10.468
Different lives.

812
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.663
Yes, yes, I have John.

813
01:09:14.665 --> 01:09:18.389
Our lives have taken
us on different paths.


814
01:09:18.391 --> 01:09:22.808
The summer of '27 was the
happiest time of my life.


815
01:12:45.905 --> 01:12:46.738
Federico!

816
01:16:40.959 --> 01:16:42.458
Merci, Emilia.

817
01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:45.627
Poor Federico, so taken with Salvador.

818
01:16:48.556 --> 01:16:51.289
I should have foreseen what happened.

819
01:16:51.291 --> 01:16:55.124
I just didn't understand
how it was with them.


820
01:16:57.161 --> 01:16:59.712
But that was quite normal.

821
01:16:59.714 --> 01:17:02.464
You were too young, too innocent.

822
01:17:04.116 --> 01:17:08.733
And women look at things
from a different perspective.


823
01:17:08.735 --> 01:17:10.645
That's true, my dear.

824
01:17:10.647 --> 01:17:12.519
Well, whether that was nonsense or not,

825
01:17:12.521 --> 01:17:14.963
he certainly cultivated the legend.

826
01:17:14.965 --> 01:17:16.842
King of marketing himself,

827
01:17:16.844 --> 01:17:19.011
of knowing how to control things.

828
01:17:19.013 --> 01:17:23.430
And Gala controlling
everything, such a cold woman.


829
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:28.951
Do you know, Salvador even put it about

830
01:17:31.118 --> 01:17:35.201
that my father was
responsible for his impotence.


831
01:17:36.206 --> 01:17:38.702
How could that be?

832
01:17:38.704 --> 01:17:41.871
He accused him of having allowed him

833
01:17:43.048 --> 01:17:48.048
to read a book about venereal
disease when he was a child,


834
01:17:48.461 --> 01:17:50.967
and this had left him
with a lifelong hatred


835
01:17:50.969 --> 01:17:52.891
of female genitalia.

836
01:17:52.893 --> 01:17:55.476
That's impossible to believe.

837
01:18:48.082 --> 01:18:50.665
Regino, Federico, my brother.

838
01:23:15.301 --> 01:23:18.634
Ole!

839
01:24:09.015 --> 01:24:12.015
Salvador had a gift for seduction.

840
01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.793
But the truth is

841
01:24:17.129 --> 01:24:21.129
he was concerned only
with his work, his career.


842
01:24:22.035 --> 01:24:26.368
- He wanted to go far.
- And by God he certainly did.


843
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:30.100
None of us could had the slightest notion

844
01:24:30.102 --> 01:24:34.078
that Federico would never
set foot in our house again.


845
01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.830
He became more and more famous.

846
01:24:36.832 --> 01:24:40.081
Yerma, Dona Rosita, 
Blood Wedding,

847
01:24:40.083 --> 01:24:42.742
The House of Bernarda Alba,
always Margarita Xirgu.


848
01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.827
It was a meteoric career.

849
01:24:45.775 --> 01:24:48.582
Perhaps it was his stardom

850
01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:51.907
that distanced him from your brother.

851
01:24:51.909 --> 01:24:54.826
Salvador always went his own way.

852
01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:58.539
And now in his mind, he had
already created another world,


853
01:24:58.541 --> 01:25:00.541
the world of surrealism.

854
01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.056
It took him to the
zenith of his profession.


855
01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:09.225
And led him to break with
all of us who loved him.


856
01:25:10.383 --> 01:25:12.013
Do you mind if I have a cigarette?

857
01:25:12.015 --> 01:25:13.980
Oh, Maggie, Maggie.

858
01:25:13.982 --> 01:25:16.532
- Just one.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.


859
01:26:51.277 --> 01:26:53.738
Federico did not deserve that.

860
01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.935
I don't know why Salvador went so far.

861
01:26:56.937 --> 01:27:00.034
'Cause I'm afraid there
was rivalry between them.


862
01:27:00.036 --> 01:27:01.475
At his next exhibition,

863
01:27:01.477 --> 01:27:05.757
people were scandalized by
two of Salvador's paintings.


864
01:27:05.759 --> 01:27:08.241
The aggressively phallic finger

865
01:27:08.243 --> 01:27:12.164
and the hand of The Great
Masturbator were unacceptable.


866
01:27:12.166 --> 01:27:13.137
That would have shocked

867
01:27:13.139 --> 01:27:16.823
the conservative hypocritical
minds in London as well.


868
01:27:16.825 --> 01:27:20.575
He took any opportunity
to promote himself.


869
01:27:22.327 --> 01:27:26.160
But he was making great
advances as an artist.


870
01:27:29.023 --> 01:27:30.977
Leaps and bounds.

871
01:29:38.137 --> 01:29:40.775
Bunuel came from Paris in January.

872
01:29:40.777 --> 01:29:44.071
He came to finish a film
script with my brother.


873
01:29:44.073 --> 01:29:48.073
Two extraordinary men,
crazy about the cinema.


874
01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:50.419
What a couple.

875
01:29:50.421 --> 01:29:52.885
But in Paris, behind his back,

876
01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:56.252
Bunuel was criticizing Salvador.

877
01:29:56.254 --> 01:29:57.356
That's because he believed

878
01:29:57.358 --> 01:30:01.604
your brother was a greater
genius and that bothered him.


879
01:30:01.606 --> 01:30:03.847
Hold still, don't move.

880
01:30:03.849 --> 01:30:05.328
Oh, that was perfect.

881
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:07.488
That's perfect.

882
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:09.823
And also, he couldn't bear

883
01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:14.592
that Salvador was so close to Federico.

884
01:30:14.594 --> 01:30:18.078
But he needed my brother's talent.

885
01:33:00.473 --> 01:33:02.383
They wanted to conquer the world,

886
01:33:02.385 --> 01:33:06.666
and with a short that
lasted under 20 minutes,


887
01:33:06.668 --> 01:33:08.311
they managed it.

888
01:33:08.313 --> 01:33:11.205
They knew exactly
what they were going to do.


889
01:33:11.207 --> 01:33:13.242
Yes, and Bunuel was very clever.

890
01:33:13.244 --> 01:33:16.925
He promoted it very well and
the creme de la creme in Paris


891
01:33:16.927 --> 01:33:21.177
made it into a myth, the
masterpiece of surrealism.


892
01:33:22.139 --> 01:33:23.056
17 minutes.

893
01:33:24.985 --> 01:33:27.215
That was
their genius, Anna Maria.


894
01:33:27.217 --> 01:33:29.994
The film shoot
was due to start in April,


895
01:33:29.996 --> 01:33:32.298
and Salvador was already in Paris

896
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.286
absolutely determined to be in the film.

897
01:33:35.288 --> 01:33:38.539
That admirable quality
for never missing a trick.


898
01:33:38.541 --> 01:33:41.653
Joan Miro opened the doors for him

899
01:33:41.655 --> 01:33:44.155
into the most refined society.

900
01:33:45.392 --> 01:33:47.143
He told him to buy a tuxedo

901
01:33:47.145 --> 01:33:51.557
because in Paris it is
important to dress smartly.


902
01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:54.627
Was between the world wars.

903
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.879
Miro was such a nice man.

904
01:33:58.709 --> 01:34:02.730
Your brother never wrote
a nice word about Miro.


905
01:34:02.732 --> 01:34:05.285
Salvador liked to make people think

906
01:34:05.287 --> 01:34:09.928
that when he was a child, he
would hide his private parts


907
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:13.793
between his thighs so
as to look like a girl.


908
01:34:13.795 --> 01:34:15.494
That was in his book.

909
01:34:15.496 --> 01:34:18.579
Cadaques didn't offer any luxuries.

910
01:34:20.477 --> 01:34:21.988
It wouldn't be what it is today

911
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:24.503
without Salvador's magical ability

912
01:34:24.505 --> 01:34:29.159
to attract the glitterati
from all over the world.


913
01:34:29.161 --> 01:34:30.634
He was a magnet.

914
01:34:30.636 --> 01:34:34.303
Salvador met Gala out
there on this beach.


915
01:39:50.645 --> 01:39:52.395
That is what he said.

916
01:39:53.285 --> 01:39:56.817
Very theatrical, hard to believe,

917
01:39:56.819 --> 01:39:59.732
like a second-rate Greek tragedy.

918
01:39:59.734 --> 01:40:01.401
Gala abducted him.

919
01:40:03.278 --> 01:40:05.528
Our world slowly collapsed.

920
01:40:06.728 --> 01:40:08.696
While theirs rose up.

921
01:40:08.698 --> 01:40:10.508
Well, they went to Paris.

922
01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:13.353
Gala sent Eluard and Cecile to hell.

923
01:40:13.355 --> 01:40:17.311
Gala and my brother were
inseparable for nearly 40 years.


924
01:40:17.313 --> 01:40:21.396
Yet in the end, she went
crazy with her lovers,


925
01:40:22.521 --> 01:40:25.354
and used Pubol for her dalliances.

926
01:40:28.294 --> 01:40:33.294
The exhibition at Goemans'
gallery in '29 was very good.


927
01:40:33.622 --> 01:40:36.534
Breton approved the paintings,

928
01:40:36.536 --> 01:40:38.921
but the critics did not receive them

929
01:40:38.923 --> 01:40:41.740
as well as they had hoped.

930
01:40:41.742 --> 01:40:46.025
And that is when he said
that outrageous thing.


931
01:40:54.139 --> 01:40:55.639
The famous spit.

932
01:40:56.909 --> 01:40:59.861
He wanted to project this
image of the great surrealist


933
01:40:59.863 --> 01:41:03.925
with no respect for anything or anyone,

934
01:41:03.927 --> 01:41:07.204
not even the portrait of his mother.

935
01:41:07.206 --> 01:41:10.684
And he did that with The Sacred Heart.

936
01:41:10.686 --> 01:41:15.019
I Spit With Pleasure on
the Portrait of my Mother.


937
01:41:18.733 --> 01:41:22.400
And that is the end of
my father's notebook.


938
01:42:30.468 --> 01:42:32.801
And then, Father said to me,

939
01:42:33.861 --> 01:42:37.423
"You, Anna Maria, are going to England.

940
01:42:37.425 --> 01:42:39.989
"You will study at Cambridge.

941
01:42:39.991 --> 01:42:42.555
"They are more civilized there."

942
01:42:42.557 --> 01:42:46.731
And disciplined, my dear,
much more disciplined.


943
01:42:46.733 --> 01:42:48.555
We had such a good time.

944
01:42:48.557 --> 01:42:51.546
Oh, life is amazing.

945
01:42:57.705 --> 01:43:01.288
His first
exile lasted five years.


946
01:43:05.592 --> 01:43:06.860
Who made the peace?

947
01:43:06.862 --> 01:43:09.236
Uncle Rafael managed it,

948
01:43:09.238 --> 01:43:13.333
but our house never enjoyed
that wonderful atmosphere again.


949
01:43:13.335 --> 01:43:16.594
Everything has a beginning and an end.

950
01:43:16.596 --> 01:43:19.309
Bunuel came back to
film some of the scenes


951
01:43:19.311 --> 01:43:21.410
for L'Age d'Or at Cap de Creus,

952
01:43:21.412 --> 01:43:25.297
which infuriated my father even more.

953
01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:26.568
They were called all sorts of things,

954
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:29.749
Bolsheviks, pornographers, blasphemers.

955
01:43:29.751 --> 01:43:32.197
Not even Paris could
accept such an attack


956
01:43:32.199 --> 01:43:34.165
on bourgeois values.

957
01:43:34.167 --> 01:43:37.864
The youth of French
Action wrecked the cinema,


958
01:43:37.866 --> 01:43:42.156
throwing ink at the screen,
setting off tear gas shooting,


959
01:43:42.158 --> 01:43:44.080
beating up the spectators.

960
01:43:44.082 --> 01:43:46.091
A real political riot.

961
01:43:46.093 --> 01:43:49.189
It was the perfect excuse
for the chief of police


962
01:43:49.191 --> 01:43:52.175
to ban the film and confiscate the prints.

963
01:43:52.177 --> 01:43:56.790
It would be half a century
before L'Age d'Or was seen again.


964
01:43:56.792 --> 01:44:00.406
But Dali and Bunuel
were catapulted to fame.


965
01:44:00.408 --> 01:44:01.712
Precisely.

966
01:44:01.714 --> 01:44:04.547
Meeting you was such a help to me.

967
01:44:05.442 --> 01:44:07.229
I remember it so well.

968
01:44:07.231 --> 01:44:09.829
And it was while I was away

969
01:44:09.831 --> 01:44:14.117
that Salvador bought the
shack in Port Lligat.


970
01:44:14.119 --> 01:44:15.462
You couldn't get there by car.

971
01:44:15.464 --> 01:44:18.653
They had to transport
everything by donkey.


972
01:44:18.655 --> 01:44:21.114
But nothing could stop Salvador.

973
01:44:21.116 --> 01:44:23.980
He was becoming increasingly famous.

974
01:44:23.982 --> 01:44:27.114
He wanted to make Port Lligat
the center of the universe.


975
01:44:28.072 --> 01:44:29.919
His enchanted garden.

976
01:44:29.921 --> 01:44:33.004
Oh, to me it was the witch's house.

977
01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:37.445
And then, it was the Republic.

978
01:44:37.447 --> 01:44:39.604
Federico came back from America.

979
01:44:39.606 --> 01:44:43.374
He had become an extremely
important author,


980
01:44:43.376 --> 01:44:46.075
and he was very politically involved,

981
01:44:46.077 --> 01:44:50.099
much admired as the symbol
of the new Spanish Republic.


982
01:44:50.101 --> 01:44:54.434
Was so appalling when the
Francoists executed him.


983
01:44:56.638 --> 01:45:00.471
I only saw him once
again, in December 1935.


984
01:48:00.982 --> 01:48:02.216
I wasn't there.

985
01:48:02.218 --> 01:48:04.079
I arrived when the shouting was all over

986
01:48:04.081 --> 01:48:07.008
and my father had given in.

987
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:11.260
So much crying made it seem
like a cheap melodrama.


988
01:48:14.283 --> 01:48:17.033
In the last 15 years of his life,

989
01:48:18.311 --> 01:48:20.561
my father made eight wills.

990
01:48:22.683 --> 01:48:27.606
Every time Salvador made some
outrage, he drew up a new one.


991
01:48:27.608 --> 01:48:29.129
Salvador told everyone

992
01:48:29.131 --> 01:48:32.290
that the family kept
a lot of his artwork.

993
01:48:32.292 --> 01:48:34.516
No, no, no, that was later,

994
01:48:34.518 --> 01:48:37.435
when he was outraged about my book.

995
01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:39.687
No.

996
01:48:39.689 --> 01:48:43.439
Salvador closed the
doors of his world to us.


997
01:48:46.323 --> 01:48:50.221
He or Gala, it makes no
difference to me who.


998
01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:52.381
Can't take any more
photographs in this light.


999
01:48:52.383 --> 01:48:55.966
I have spent 40 years
without my brother.


1000
01:48:59.881 --> 01:49:02.616
Things went amazingly well for him.

1001
01:49:02.618 --> 01:49:05.787
You went through many hard times.

1002
01:49:05.789 --> 01:49:08.872
The Civil War broke out, many died.

1003
01:49:11.837 --> 01:49:14.504
I don't know why I was arrested.

1004
01:49:16.702 --> 01:49:19.785
A Francoist spy, me, it's ridiculous.

1005
01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:24.603
We were all terrified of the Anarchists.

1006
01:49:24.605 --> 01:49:27.526
They had already killed
the village schoolmaster,


1007
01:49:27.528 --> 01:49:30.275
a good man who'd not been
involved in anything.


1008
01:49:58.389 --> 01:50:01.319
It was like hell in Barcelona.

1009
01:50:01.321 --> 01:50:03.654
Two weeks of being tortured,

1010
01:50:04.918 --> 01:50:08.457
you have no any idea what it's like.

1011
01:50:08.459 --> 01:50:11.792
I shouted day and night like a madwoman.

1012
01:50:12.853 --> 01:50:17.270
It was lucky a friend managed
to get me out of there.


1013
01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:25.365
He took me to my Uncle
Rafael's house in Barcelona.


1014
01:50:26.475 --> 01:50:27.975
I owe him my life.

1015
01:50:30.412 --> 01:50:32.829
When I arrived, I had amnesia

1016
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:37.448
and I was unable to control my sphincter.

1017
01:50:39.556 --> 01:50:40.973
I was nearly mad.

1018
01:50:43.209 --> 01:50:45.792
It took me years to get better.

1019
01:50:48.453 --> 01:50:50.203
I was never the same.

1020
01:50:52.221 --> 01:50:55.206
The war changed all of us.

1021
01:50:55.208 --> 01:50:57.220
When it began, 
Salvador was in London,

1022
01:50:57.222 --> 01:50:59.805
at a dinner in the Savoy Hotel.

1023
01:51:01.355 --> 01:51:04.591
He stayed away for three years.

1024
01:51:04.593 --> 01:51:07.600
He certainly was in
the papers a good deal.


1025
01:51:07.602 --> 01:51:10.185
He went to Mussolini's Italy.

1026
01:51:12.850 --> 01:51:14.796
He showed his true colors.

1027
01:51:14.798 --> 01:51:17.465
He was very criticized in Paris.

1028
01:51:18.543 --> 01:51:21.916
It was as though he had no ideology.

1029
01:51:21.918 --> 01:51:23.418
He was Dalinian.

1030
01:51:24.349 --> 01:51:27.805
He got no convictions about anything.

1031
01:51:27.807 --> 01:51:31.384
None.

1032
01:51:31.386 --> 01:51:34.770
He prepared his arrival
in New York very well.


1033
01:51:34.772 --> 01:51:38.262
He seduced the journalists
with his portrait of Gala,


1034
01:51:38.264 --> 01:51:43.094
I have brought
the portrait of my wife.


1035
01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:46.263
The one with the ribs on the shoulder.

1036
01:51:48.569 --> 01:51:53.235
It didn't matter
if they were raw or fried.


1037
01:51:53.237 --> 01:51:55.276
It was a very big thing.

1038
01:51:55.278 --> 01:51:58.980
I was very proud of my friend's brother.

1039
01:51:58.982 --> 01:52:01.982
I've still have the Time magazine.

1040
01:52:06.254 --> 01:52:10.844
Surrealism would not have
captured such attention


1041
01:52:10.846 --> 01:52:14.938
if it were not for an
attractive 32-year-old Catalan


1042
01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:18.039
with a soft voice and
a well-groomed mustache


1043
01:52:18.041 --> 01:52:20.415
like a movie actor.

1044
01:52:20.417 --> 01:52:23.027
How clever of you to have kept everything.

1045
01:52:23.029 --> 01:52:26.655
He was having more and more arguments

1046
01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:30.282
with the Surrealists
and with the Communists.


1047
01:52:30.284 --> 01:52:34.387
In Dali's madness, there is
all the wisdom of Broadway.


1048
01:52:35.845 --> 01:52:39.514
He has a gift for publicity
which would make any press agent


1049
01:52:39.516 --> 01:52:42.408
representing a circus die of envy.

1050
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:46.304
He learned a lot in New York.

1051
01:52:47.670 --> 01:52:49.022
New York was his El Dorado.

1052
01:52:49.024 --> 01:52:52.357
He even compared Manhattan with Egypt.

1053
01:52:53.406 --> 01:52:57.073
He saw the skyscrapers
as inverted pyramids.


1054
01:52:58.946 --> 01:53:00.835
And it was the only place

1055
01:53:00.837 --> 01:53:04.595
where he could sign contracts constantly.

1056
01:53:05.942 --> 01:53:09.319
Gala crossed borders with suitcases

1057
01:53:09.321 --> 01:53:12.818
full of bundles of 100-dollar bills.

1058
01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:16.565
They didn't dare stop her
as she was Madame Dali.


1059
01:53:16.567 --> 01:53:17.644
But they got into trouble

1060
01:53:17.646 --> 01:53:20.647
with the American tax
authorities, didn't they?


1061
01:53:20.649 --> 01:53:23.631
Yes, a criminal investigation,
it was very serious.


1062
01:53:23.633 --> 01:53:27.491
Gala was more like
a member of the mafia

1063
01:53:27.493 --> 01:53:30.947
than the wife of the most
fashionable painter in the world.


1064
01:53:30.949 --> 01:53:33.227
She had three passions:

1065
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:37.396
luxury, young men with
sculpted bodies, and money.


1066
01:53:39.675 --> 01:53:42.258
My brother admired her greed,

1067
01:53:44.334 --> 01:53:47.704
the strength of her determination,

1068
01:53:47.706 --> 01:53:50.206
and her terrifying black eyes.

1069
01:53:52.025 --> 01:53:54.045
It's a good description.

1070
01:53:54.047 --> 01:53:55.302
Well, I'm right, am I not?

1071
01:53:55.304 --> 01:53:57.827
Believe me, I'm restraining myself.

1072
01:53:57.829 --> 01:54:00.706
Picasso said, as far as he was concerned,

1073
01:54:00.708 --> 01:54:04.688
Dali no longer existed.

1074
01:54:04.690 --> 01:54:09.690
Salvador knew who was going
to win the Spanish Civil War.


1075
01:54:09.846 --> 01:54:12.129
He knew what he should do.

1076
01:54:12.131 --> 01:54:13.795
Go to Hollywood.

1077
01:54:13.797 --> 01:54:15.942
So many projects.

1078
01:54:15.944 --> 01:54:18.272
None of them got made.

1079
01:54:18.274 --> 01:54:20.886
He did some drawings for Disney.

1080
01:54:20.888 --> 01:54:23.549
Who came to Cadaques,

1081
01:54:23.551 --> 01:54:27.912
and Salvador greeted with
jasmine behind his ears.


1082
01:54:27.914 --> 01:54:32.747
He did just 15 seconds for
Disney and then he was fired.


1083
01:54:35.282 --> 01:54:36.113
How typical.

1084
01:54:36.115 --> 01:54:37.410
And then he added

1085
01:54:37.412 --> 01:54:41.292
that Disney had a secret
stash of erotic objects


1086
01:54:41.294 --> 01:54:43.461
and pornographic drawings.

1087
01:54:44.827 --> 01:54:48.326
He designed the dream sequence
of Spellbound for Hitchcock,


1088
01:54:48.328 --> 01:54:50.852
but neither of them
was very happy with it.


1089
01:54:50.854 --> 01:54:54.053
Is it true that Freud told him

1090
01:54:54.055 --> 01:54:57.380
he had psychological problems?

1091
01:54:57.382 --> 01:55:00.153
Well, Salvador showed him

1092
01:55:00.155 --> 01:55:03.254
his painting of the myth of Narcissus.

1093
01:55:03.256 --> 01:55:04.879
Do you know what Freud said?

1094
01:55:04.881 --> 01:55:05.826
No.

1095
01:55:05.828 --> 01:55:08.661
"This boy seems to be a fanatic.

1096
01:55:09.855 --> 01:55:11.782
"If they are all like him,

1097
01:55:11.784 --> 01:55:14.666
"I am not surprised they
have a Civil War in Spain."


1098
01:55:17.474 --> 01:55:21.474
But that only inflated
Salvador's ego even more.


1099
01:55:22.554 --> 01:55:26.221
In Secret Life,
Salvador took his revenge.


1100
01:55:27.737 --> 01:55:31.693
He showed the great
master of psychoanalysis


1101
01:55:31.695 --> 01:55:33.920
with the skull of a snail

1102
01:55:33.922 --> 01:55:36.847
and a brain that had to be
extracted with a needle.


1103
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:43.032
He was crazy about snails.

1104
01:55:43.034 --> 01:55:45.830
When the Civil War began,

1105
01:55:45.832 --> 01:55:50.332
I wrote to him and I asked
him if I could go to Paris,


1106
01:55:51.396 --> 01:55:53.927
if he could help me get a job,

1107
01:55:53.929 --> 01:55:56.596
I spoke both French and English.

1108
01:55:59.585 --> 01:56:00.835
Um, he refused.

1109
01:56:04.992 --> 01:56:09.325
So, I stayed here and, well,
you know what happened.


1110
01:56:14.481 --> 01:56:17.814
It took me a long
time to get over that.

1111
01:56:19.519 --> 01:56:22.936
Well, it would seem to me, you haven't.

1112
01:56:29.281 --> 01:56:32.864
Perhaps, some things
are hard to forgive.


1113
01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:40.769
We didn't see him again until 1940.

1114
01:56:40.771 --> 01:56:42.854
We were all other people.

1115
01:58:27.006 --> 01:58:30.730
It was eight years before
he set foot in Europe.


1116
01:58:30.732 --> 01:58:32.134
We knew what he was up to

1117
01:58:32.136 --> 01:58:35.141
because he sent us the American cuttings.

1118
01:58:35.143 --> 01:58:38.702
In Spain, hardly anything got published.

1119
01:58:38.704 --> 01:58:41.621
They were years of total isolation.

1120
01:58:43.271 --> 01:58:45.688
Dali goes fast and furious.

1121
01:58:49.439 --> 01:58:54.347
One of the youngest, richest
painters in the world.


1122
01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:05.841
Clark Gable, Bob Hope,
Bing Crosby, Ginger Rogers.


1123
01:59:48.849 --> 01:59:52.226
Eight years of frenetic activity.

1124
01:59:52.228 --> 01:59:53.943
I don't know where he found the time.

1125
01:59:53.945 --> 01:59:55.778
He was at every event.

1126
01:59:56.784 --> 01:59:58.348
His golden years.

1127
01:59:58.350 --> 02:00:00.483
Even in London we knew about him.

1128
02:00:00.485 --> 02:00:03.580
And he was busy writing Secret Life,

1129
02:00:03.582 --> 02:00:07.285
he wanted it to be a
huge commercial success.


1130
02:00:07.287 --> 02:00:10.143
Well, I was fascinated by
it, so were many of my friends.


1131
02:00:10.145 --> 02:00:14.509
He was a master
practitioner of exaggeration.


1132
02:00:14.511 --> 02:00:16.928
Yes, extremely imaginative.

1133
02:00:17.949 --> 02:00:22.097
He asked me to provide
photos of our childhood.


1134
02:01:07.961 --> 02:01:10.961
Secret Life created huge excitement.

1135
02:01:11.961 --> 02:01:14.118
It sold very well in America.

1136
02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:15.424
Oh, in London as well.

1137
02:01:15.426 --> 02:01:18.027
When he was writing
it, I had written to him


1138
02:01:18.029 --> 02:01:21.031
to ask him if I could
translate it into Spanish.


1139
02:01:21.033 --> 02:01:22.672
I didn't know.

1140
02:01:22.674 --> 02:01:25.323
His reply should have
warned me of what was to come.


1141
02:01:25.325 --> 02:01:27.408
He wrote, don't be angry.

1142
02:01:29.012 --> 02:01:34.012
Halley's Comet hit you on
the head when you were four.


1143
02:01:42.136 --> 02:01:47.136
I spent a lot of time making
notes about so much distortion.


1144
02:01:57.567 --> 02:02:02.067
Not even his lack of respect
for our mother was in it.


1145
02:02:02.965 --> 02:02:05.886
That was when I
had the idea of explaining

1146
02:02:05.888 --> 02:02:08.888
what our lives had really been like.

1147
02:02:12.441 --> 02:02:13.774
Cats and dogs?

1148
02:02:14.715 --> 02:02:18.272
It's raining cats and dogs in Barcelona.

1149
02:02:18.274 --> 02:02:21.025
No, here it's good, don't
worry it won't last.


1150
02:02:21.027 --> 02:02:23.790
Listen, I may be a little bit late.

1151
02:02:23.792 --> 02:02:25.459
No, no, have dinner.

1152
02:02:26.802 --> 02:02:29.772
You know I am a careful driver.

1153
02:02:29.774 --> 02:02:30.857
Lots of love.

1154
02:02:38.397 --> 02:02:40.147
He's such a good man.

1155
02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.240
After all, we've both been
fortunate in different ways.


1156
02:02:46.613 --> 02:02:47.530
- Hmm.
- Hm.


1157
02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:52.353
I can stay a
little longer but not much.

1158
02:02:53.258 --> 02:02:54.089
Would you like an omelet?

1159
02:02:54.091 --> 02:02:56.190
No, no, no, I never have dinner.

1160
02:02:56.192 --> 02:03:01.029
I'll have something when
I get back to the hotel.


1161
02:03:01.031 --> 02:03:04.364
An honorable attempt at self-portrait.

1162
02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:07.910
Truth and lies.

1163
02:03:09.222 --> 02:03:12.460
He orchestrated them very
cleverly, he was very sharp.


1164
02:03:12.462 --> 02:03:16.765
The intrauterine
consciousness was an original.


1165
02:03:16.767 --> 02:03:19.491
A heavenly place, like paradise.

1166
02:03:19.493 --> 02:03:23.326
But with the color of
hell, red like flames,


1167
02:03:25.788 --> 02:03:27.955
but soft, hot, and sticky,

1168
02:03:29.007 --> 02:03:33.239
from where I could already see fried eggs.

1169
02:03:33.241 --> 02:03:35.724
Well, it enthralled me.

1170
02:03:35.726 --> 02:03:38.541
- John was not so convinced.
- Aw.


1171
02:03:38.543 --> 02:03:42.721
He explains it all in
a way that portrays him


1172
02:03:42.723 --> 02:03:44.603
in the best light.

1173
02:03:44.605 --> 02:03:48.384
Not a word about his rampant Marxism.

1174
02:03:48.386 --> 02:03:51.412
He doesn't acknowledge Breton.

1175
02:03:51.414 --> 02:03:55.289
He says he is the father of Surrealism,

1176
02:03:55.291 --> 02:03:57.897
and then, he undermines it.

1177
02:03:57.899 --> 02:04:00.742
He blames Communist Bunuel

1178
02:04:00.744 --> 02:04:03.524
for the anti-clericalism of L'Age d'Or.

1179
02:04:03.526 --> 02:04:05.108
Oh, poor man.

1180
02:04:05.110 --> 02:04:07.213
That was why Bunuel
was expelled from MoMA


1181
02:04:07.215 --> 02:04:08.192
and went to Mexico.

1182
02:04:08.194 --> 02:04:09.980
He never forgave my brother.

1183
02:04:09.982 --> 02:04:11.210
I am not surprised.

1184
02:04:11.212 --> 02:04:12.230
There was very bad blood.

1185
02:04:12.232 --> 02:04:16.045
Salvador wanted to flatter
America, the promised land.


1186
02:04:16.047 --> 02:04:19.130
Selling was of the utmost importance.

1187
02:04:20.086 --> 02:04:24.086
He made sycophantic
portraits of helpful people,


1188
02:04:29.027 --> 02:04:31.728
- pieces of jewelry.
- And commercials


1189
02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:35.239
- of cars, of chocolates.
- Everything.


1190
02:04:35.241 --> 02:04:37.258
The amount of money he
amassed was unbelievable.


1191
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.805
His fame, not at all.

1192
02:04:38.807 --> 02:04:40.954
He knew the way to survive.

1193
02:04:40.956 --> 02:04:43.456
It's a good and readable book.

1194
02:04:44.335 --> 02:04:46.418
A little long but well written.

1195
02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:51.337
It's a good story written by
a cunning and brilliant man.


1196
02:04:53.425 --> 02:04:55.758
To distract curious fools.

1197
02:04:57.147 --> 02:05:00.937
Now I will have a glass
of your sweet liquor.


1198
02:05:02.266 --> 02:05:05.653
Cadaques's
prodigal son felt homesick


1199
02:05:05.655 --> 02:05:08.072
for the fishermen and their nets.

1200
02:05:08.074 --> 02:05:10.824
He couldn't stay away any longer.

1201
02:05:12.207 --> 02:05:17.207
But the building work at the
shack was not quite finished.


1202
02:05:17.241 --> 02:05:20.491
I spent a few difficult days with Gala.

1203
02:05:21.611 --> 02:05:23.415
I couldn't forgive her

1204
02:05:23.417 --> 02:05:27.029
for the unhappiness
she brought our family.


1205
02:05:27.031 --> 02:05:29.509
You were already
preparing your book,


1206
02:05:29.511 --> 02:05:32.889
and you didn't tell
Salvador anything about it.


1207
02:05:32.891 --> 02:05:36.224
I only wanted to set matters straight.

1208
02:05:37.681 --> 02:05:40.681
I put on a
good face and kept quiet.

1209
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:13.509
Our last family photograph.

1210
02:07:13.511 --> 02:07:15.511
He was working non-stop.

1211
02:07:17.817 --> 02:07:20.468
He did the sets for Don Juan Tenorio,

1212
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:23.433
a great success in Madrid.

1213
02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:28.106
Peter Brook came to Port
Lligat to pick up the designs


1214
02:07:28.108 --> 02:07:31.887
for the Salome of Strauss in London.

1215
02:07:31.889 --> 02:07:34.389
I saw it together with John.

1216
02:07:35.477 --> 02:07:38.969
It was canceled after six performances.

1217
02:07:38.971 --> 02:07:40.295
Oh.

1218
02:07:40.297 --> 02:07:43.948
They had a great success in
Rome with As You Like It,


1219
02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:45.982
directed by Visconti.

1220
02:07:45.984 --> 02:07:47.807
I didn't know.

1221
02:07:47.809 --> 02:07:49.441
All the BBC talked about

1222
02:07:49.443 --> 02:07:52.443
was how he was received by Pius XII.

1223
02:08:48.254 --> 02:08:49.921
Oh, hello, Joanne.

1224
02:08:51.421 --> 02:08:52.963
I'm sorry I'm late.

1225
02:08:52.965 --> 02:08:54.089
Hello, darling.

1226
02:08:54.091 --> 02:08:55.174
Mwah, mwah.

1227
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:57.794
What a performance.

1228
02:08:57.796 --> 02:09:00.708
Oh yes, he almost suffocated himself

1229
02:09:00.710 --> 02:09:01.954
in that wretched helmet.

1230
02:09:01.956 --> 02:09:03.951
You know, it was bolted on.

1231
02:09:03.953 --> 02:09:06.346
That's why I believe in destiny.

1232
02:09:06.348 --> 02:09:08.679
You'll be credited for
saving him so many times.


1233
02:09:09.681 --> 02:09:11.106
Any news from that mad house?

1234
02:09:11.108 --> 02:09:15.840
Hmm, I left Gala sitting in
her egg-shaped yellow room,


1235
02:09:15.842 --> 02:09:19.546
as usual surrounded by with
dozens of piles of $100 bills,


1236
02:09:19.548 --> 02:09:23.407
counting and recounting
them three or four times.


1237
02:09:24.242 --> 02:09:25.342
- Cheers, darling.
- Cheers, dear.


1238
02:09:28.398 --> 02:09:29.231
Mm.

1239
02:09:30.676 --> 02:09:33.715
She is Madame Dali, of course.

1240
02:09:33.717 --> 02:09:37.634
And Salvador, a
self-proclaimed masochist, huh.


1241
02:09:38.637 --> 02:09:41.759
Dali and I have proved
to be a formidable duo.


1242
02:09:41.761 --> 02:09:44.327
He entertains, 
I'm the straight man.

1243
02:09:44.329 --> 02:09:47.967
He is the hustler, 
I'm the troubleshooter.

1244
02:09:47.969 --> 02:09:51.555
And he's the creative one,
and I produce the dotted line.


1245
02:09:53.029 --> 02:09:55.150
We are a relentless team

1246
02:09:55.152 --> 02:09:58.949
with investors laughing as they
dig deep into their pockets.


1247
02:09:58.951 --> 02:10:01.577
Well, he is Catalan, you're Irish.

1248
02:10:01.579 --> 02:10:05.636
He's the great painter,
and you're the ex-army man.


1249
02:10:05.638 --> 02:10:08.471
He thrives on change and theatrics

1250
02:10:10.290 --> 02:10:13.483
while you, you prefer routine and order.

1251
02:10:13.485 --> 02:10:16.337
I soon understood what he wanted.

1252
02:10:16.339 --> 02:10:18.089
"Projects, Capitaine.

1253
02:10:19.137 --> 02:10:24.030
"Big or small, find Dali
new projects, new campaigns,


1254
02:10:24.032 --> 02:10:28.720
"new investors, new
reporters and photographers.


1255
02:10:28.722 --> 02:10:31.673
"Make Dali even more great."

1256
02:10:31.675 --> 02:10:32.949
Hey, and what happened in Rome

1257
02:10:32.951 --> 02:10:37.338
with The Christ of
Saint John of the Cross?


1258
02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:40.214
- What, with Pius XII?
- Why, the fascist.


1259
02:10:40.216 --> 02:10:41.654
Nothing, really.

1260
02:10:41.656 --> 02:10:44.382
A scandal, nothing out of the ordinary.

1261
02:10:45.217 --> 02:10:48.845
Dali was very impressed,
like a child would be,


1262
02:10:48.847 --> 02:10:50.860
as we passed the Swiss Guards.

1263
02:10:50.862 --> 02:10:53.978
Oh, dressed in their
puffy multi-colored outfits


1264
02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:56.401
designed by Michelangelo.

1265
02:10:56.403 --> 02:11:00.080
Well, I noticed a light layer
of sweat upon his forehead


1266
02:11:00.082 --> 02:11:03.513
as he knelt and kissed the pontiff's ring.

1267
02:11:03.515 --> 02:11:05.682
Now, the pope spoke of art

1268
02:11:07.093 --> 02:11:11.094
while Dali expressed his
desire to find grace.


1269
02:11:11.096 --> 02:11:12.090
Grace?

1270
02:11:12.092 --> 02:11:13.135
And what else?

1271
02:11:13.137 --> 02:11:14.700
Nothing about the painting?

1272
02:11:14.702 --> 02:11:15.533
Nope.

1273
02:11:15.535 --> 02:11:18.520
And as he skipped down
the corridor afterwards,


1274
02:11:18.522 --> 02:11:22.964
he said, "The best day, the
best day of Dali's life."


1275
02:11:22.966 --> 02:11:25.283
No, that was rather sweet.

1276
02:11:25.285 --> 02:11:27.801
The next morning, he called me.

1277
02:11:27.803 --> 02:11:29.589
"Dali is very upset."

1278
02:11:29.591 --> 02:11:31.905
So, I went to the Grand Hotel.

1279
02:11:34.964 --> 02:11:38.315
And I found him
in the lobby nearly crying

1280
02:11:38.317 --> 02:11:41.889
reading a copy of Corriere della Sera.

1281
02:11:41.891 --> 02:11:43.312
"There is no mention, hmm?

1282
02:11:43.314 --> 02:11:45.451
"What pope did you take Dali to see?"

1283
02:11:45.453 --> 02:11:49.088
Oh, not being in the
press made Dali furious.


1284
02:11:49.090 --> 02:11:51.811
"So, the pope was the real one?"

1285
02:11:51.813 --> 02:11:55.356
Of course he's
the real one, Pope Pius XII.


1286
02:11:55.358 --> 02:11:56.794
What kind of a Catholic are you?

1287
02:11:56.796 --> 02:11:58.931
Huh, that's a good question.

1288
02:11:58.933 --> 02:12:02.259
Now wait, "Not a practicing one,

1289
02:12:02.261 --> 02:12:04.790
"but I'm always waiting for an angel

1290
02:12:04.792 --> 02:12:05.826
"to tap me on the shoulder."

1291
02:12:10.411 --> 02:12:15.244
Now I was for a few days
with la signorina Lollobrigida.


1292
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:17.642
Aw.

1293
02:12:17.644 --> 02:12:19.727
Oh, they were so great.

1294
02:12:19.729 --> 02:12:21.136
What a fabulous time

1295
02:12:21.138 --> 02:12:23.091
- we had in Rome, hmm?
- Oh yes, oh yes.


1296
02:12:23.093 --> 02:12:25.549
- I missed them.
- Ah yes.


1297
02:12:25.551 --> 02:12:29.051
Vivian, and Myrna, and Cotten, and Trevor.

1298
02:12:31.157 --> 02:12:35.324
Oh, I forgot, Alida Valli,
she misses you so much.


1299
02:12:38.206 --> 02:12:39.748
And Roland Petit too.

1300
02:12:41.731 --> 02:12:44.278
Breton got fed up with him.

1301
02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:48.054
His anagram Avida Dollars

1302
02:12:48.056 --> 02:12:51.478
stayed with him all
the rest of his life.

1303
02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:54.120
He didn't take it as an insult.

1304
02:12:54.122 --> 02:12:56.955
He said every morning before work,

1305
02:12:58.266 --> 02:13:02.659
he liked to see a tasty
cheque on his breakfast tray.


1306
02:13:02.661 --> 02:13:06.586
Like King Midas, he
turned everything to gold.


1307
02:13:06.588 --> 02:13:08.569
My brother could be very witty.

1308
02:13:08.571 --> 02:13:13.321
He said living on the easternmost
point of the peninsula,


1309
02:13:14.764 --> 02:13:16.707
when he woke in the morning,

1310
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:20.665
he was the first
person to see the sun,

1311
02:13:20.667 --> 02:13:23.834
even before the beloved Generalissimo.

1312
02:13:24.923 --> 02:13:26.742
What a privilege.

1313
02:13:26.744 --> 02:13:29.812
He also said, "In the 21st century,

1314
02:13:29.814 --> 02:13:34.135
"when children ask, who is
Franco, people would say,


1315
02:13:34.137 --> 02:13:37.637
"oh, a dictator who lived in Dali's time."

1316
02:13:38.537 --> 02:13:39.454
Charming.

1317
02:13:40.306 --> 02:13:44.973
All that mattered to him
was that he was talked about.


1318
02:13:46.336 --> 02:13:50.586
He only lost his temper
once, when he read my book.


1319
02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:55.634
It took him by surprise in New York.

1320
02:13:55.636 --> 02:13:59.359
Other people could criticize
him and he would just laugh.


1321
02:13:59.361 --> 02:14:01.679
But not his sister.

1322
02:14:01.681 --> 02:14:04.848
And Gala made it worse, Gala Eluard,

1323
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:09.830
or rather, Elena Ivanovna Diakonova.

1324
02:14:12.199 --> 02:14:15.265
You hold her responsible
for rather a lot.


1325
02:14:15.267 --> 02:14:17.100
May God forgive her.

1326
02:14:18.045 --> 02:14:21.216
You still seem very bitter.

1327
02:14:21.218 --> 02:14:24.885
No, I was bitter, but
that's all over now.


1328
02:14:29.195 --> 02:14:31.945
You are still here, Anna Maria.

1329
02:14:33.173 --> 02:14:35.278
You should take better care of yourself.

1330
02:14:36.748 --> 02:14:40.914
My father drew up
the last of his wills.

1331
02:14:40.916 --> 02:14:43.666
He was to die within four months.

1332
02:15:24.918 --> 02:15:28.085
His last wishes left Salvador nothing.

1333
02:15:29.241 --> 02:15:30.866
That was what converted

1334
02:15:30.868 --> 02:15:34.618
the contempt Gala had
always shown into hate.


1335
02:15:37.424 --> 02:15:41.924
I was very upset and wasn't
able to go to the funeral.


1336
02:15:42.838 --> 02:15:45.421
Salvador didn't show up either.

1337
02:17:07.135 --> 02:17:10.494
The dictator's regime was delighted.

1338
02:17:10.496 --> 02:17:14.535
Salvador needed to be
forgiven for his past.


1339
02:17:14.537 --> 02:17:17.365
My brother's obsession with the nobility

1340
02:17:17.367 --> 02:17:19.617
went to ridiculous lengths.

1341
02:17:20.553 --> 02:17:23.819
He appeared regularly on
the Spanish news reels,


1342
02:17:23.821 --> 02:17:26.160
pure Francoist propaganda.

1343
02:17:26.162 --> 02:17:29.051
What a show.

1344
02:17:29.053 --> 02:17:30.553
I was so fed up.

1345
02:17:32.371 --> 02:17:35.782
We were no longer seeing each other.

1346
02:17:35.784 --> 02:17:39.012
I was tormented by our quarrel.

1347
02:17:39.014 --> 02:17:42.181
His sick obsession with four paintings

1348
02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:46.163
that had been left in our home.

1349
02:17:47.066 --> 02:17:50.504
I was very lucky,
Josefina always helped me.


1350
02:17:50.506 --> 02:17:54.089
After two years, Salvador
agreed to a deal,


1351
02:17:56.317 --> 02:17:58.940
but when it came to signing the papers,

1352
02:17:58.942 --> 02:18:02.192
he tore them up and evicted the notary.

1353
02:18:56.826 --> 02:19:00.409
It's a story
about crazy people.


1354
02:25:53.284 --> 02:25:55.186
Oh.

1355
02:25:55.188 --> 02:25:56.021
Oh.

1356
02:26:06.256 --> 02:26:07.989
Cadaques proudly welcomed

1357
02:26:07.991 --> 02:26:11.586
the great paranoiac of the Mediterranean.

1358
02:26:11.588 --> 02:26:12.419
Of course.

1359
02:26:12.421 --> 02:26:16.865
And the hardest working
painter who ever lived.


1360
02:26:16.867 --> 02:26:20.471
Spring, summer, autumn,
painting from dawn to dusk


1361
02:26:20.473 --> 02:26:21.801
in Port Lligat.

1362
02:26:21.803 --> 02:26:25.328
And in winter, in Paris and New York.

1363
02:26:25.330 --> 02:26:29.152
And his playtime was a
fun and witty variety show


1364
02:26:29.154 --> 02:26:30.975
crammed with sycophants.

1365
02:26:30.977 --> 02:26:33.727
Yes, I am the divine Dali, Da-li.

1366
02:26:36.474 --> 02:26:40.911
Well, the media was his
playing field, wasn't it?


1367
02:26:40.913 --> 02:26:43.548
Captain Moore was in charge
of everything then, wasn't he?


1368
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:47.545
He was the most honest
of all his secretaries,


1369
02:26:47.547 --> 02:26:50.058
and the one who made him rich.

1370
02:27:00.087 --> 02:27:02.270
What did he have for
breakfast today?


1371
02:27:02.272 --> 02:27:03.637
Horse?

1372
02:27:03.639 --> 02:27:05.723
He's in flying form.

1373
02:27:05.725 --> 02:27:07.781
He's like a little boy.

1374
02:27:07.783 --> 02:27:10.615
Or like a puppet.

1375
02:27:23.742 --> 02:27:26.930
Hmm, the savage and divine Dali.

1376
02:27:26.932 --> 02:27:29.606
Very savage.

1377
02:27:29.608 --> 02:27:33.177
Very savage indeed.

1378
02:28:09.792 --> 02:28:10.625
Ole!

1379
02:28:13.708 --> 02:28:14.541
Da-li!

1380
02:28:21.963 --> 02:28:23.713
The anguish of death.

1381
02:28:25.558 --> 02:28:29.999
No one single moment in the
capricious and eccentric life


1382
02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:34.751
of divine Dali, no one single
moment of death disappears.


1383
02:28:37.212 --> 02:28:40.491
Death is all time present
in my precious life,


1384
02:28:40.493 --> 02:28:44.160
and this is the reason
of my most obsession,


1385
02:28:45.482 --> 02:28:47.399
the modern hibernation.

1386
02:28:52.729 --> 02:28:54.629
Four.

1387
02:28:54.631 --> 02:28:55.464
Five.

1388
02:28:56.976 --> 02:28:57.809
Six.

1389
02:29:13.564 --> 02:29:14.395
Gracias.

1390
02:29:19.392 --> 02:29:22.475
I was hurt by his cowardice.

1391
02:29:23.844 --> 02:29:27.556
Because of Gala, 
I couldn't see him.

1392
02:29:27.558 --> 02:29:30.308
But in the end, 
I got used to it.

1393
02:29:32.457 --> 02:29:35.730
Joan Vehi often showed us photographs.

1394
02:29:35.732 --> 02:29:39.548
It was a consolation for many years.

1395
02:29:53.431 --> 02:29:57.109
At the Boia, Pere
made us laugh a lot.

1396
02:29:57.111 --> 02:30:01.618
He kept us up to date with
all the goings-on in the town.


1397
02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:05.199
Often, Emilia's daughter
would come and collect me,


1398
02:30:05.201 --> 02:30:07.868
and we would head home together.

1399
02:30:19.083 --> 02:30:23.583
My friends didn't abandon
me, and I made my own world.


1400
02:30:24.776 --> 02:30:26.609
Those were good years.

1401
02:30:28.047 --> 02:30:31.714
- We visited four summers.
- Oh, John loved it.


1402
02:30:33.372 --> 02:30:35.991
Josefina was doing up her house

1403
02:30:35.993 --> 02:30:38.410
and came to spend the summer.

1404
02:30:46.463 --> 02:30:48.902
There are two Cadaqueses,

1405
02:30:48.904 --> 02:30:53.571
the real one and the one you
see reflected in the water.


1406
02:30:55.691 --> 02:30:58.524
And which one attracts you most?

1407
02:30:59.604 --> 02:31:03.354
Both, one couldn't
exist without the other.


1408
02:31:07.144 --> 02:31:10.727
Salvador went from one
excess to the other.


1409
02:31:14.488 --> 02:31:19.488
He loved to sign thousands of
blank sheets for lithographs.


1410
02:31:20.195 --> 02:31:23.112
You don't know how much it hurt me.

1411
02:31:25.552 --> 02:31:27.969
I've known you a long time.

1412
02:31:28.896 --> 02:31:31.948
Gala had managed to persuade Salvador

1413
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:34.212
to buy Pubol for her.

1414
02:31:34.214 --> 02:31:36.214
She sucked up the money.

1415
02:31:38.428 --> 02:31:41.511
Her lovers worked out very expensive.

1416
02:31:42.862 --> 02:31:47.362
An artist without ethics
tends to corrupt the world.


1417
02:31:48.964 --> 02:31:52.429
And more if he
is surrounded by a gang

1418
02:31:52.431 --> 02:31:56.492
whose only thought is to
make themselves millionaires.


1419
02:31:56.494 --> 02:32:00.143
Well, in the tabloids,
Gala came off the worst.


1420
02:32:00.145 --> 02:32:04.395
Half tigress, half martyr,
half mother, half lover,


1421
02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:09.679
and half banker, with no friends.

1422
02:32:09.681 --> 02:32:11.598
Ooh, what a reputation.

1423
02:32:13.215 --> 02:32:15.132
But he is still Dali,

1424
02:32:17.978 --> 02:32:22.395
one of the greatest figures
in 20th century painting.


1425
02:32:24.328 --> 02:32:27.078
The art was greater than the man.

1426
02:32:31.499 --> 02:32:35.166
Do you remember that
summer, 15 years ago?


1427
02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:48.224
Isn't that your brother?

1428
02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:12.303
I love walking, especially
when I'm entertained


1429
02:33:12.305 --> 02:33:15.806
by characters who annoy me.

1430
02:33:15.808 --> 02:33:18.744
They take advantage of his generosity.

1431
02:33:18.746 --> 02:33:22.167
They keep him company, Josefina.

1432
02:33:37.608 --> 02:33:38.891
Can't see Gala.

1433
02:33:38.893 --> 02:33:42.605
No, she's in Pubol, going
crazy with her lovers.


1434
02:33:42.607 --> 02:33:46.039
The transsexuality of Amanda
and the androgyny of Carlos


1435
02:33:46.041 --> 02:33:50.715
seem to be the utmost
erotic expression for him.


1436
02:33:50.717 --> 02:33:54.815
The dream of the
confusion between the sexes.


1437
02:33:54.817 --> 02:33:59.241
He talks a lot about the Greek
ideal, the hermaphrodite.


1438
02:34:22.411 --> 02:34:23.244
Mwah!

1439
02:34:36.210 --> 02:34:38.384
And they don't hide anything.

1440
02:34:38.386 --> 02:34:41.731
"Balls," said the queen. "If
I had them, I'd be king."


1441
02:34:41.733 --> 02:34:44.468
Everybody says they
both are very good people.


1442
02:34:44.470 --> 02:34:46.247
Amanda is extremely clever.

1443
02:34:48.662 --> 02:34:50.745
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!

1444
02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:56.690
God forgive me, what would Father say?

1445
02:34:56.692 --> 02:34:59.590
He's been parading Amanda
around for years now


1446
02:34:59.592 --> 02:35:01.978
as if she were his new love.

1447
02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:05.755
A hook for everything
that is said about him.


1448
02:35:05.757 --> 02:35:08.094
But Gala can't stand her,

1449
02:35:08.096 --> 02:35:11.453
and has said goodbye
to Port Lligat forever.


1450
02:36:08.856 --> 02:36:10.204
Baby!

1451
02:36:10.206 --> 02:36:11.732
Baby, come back to me!

1452
02:36:37.268 --> 02:36:39.272
Salvador could only go to Pubol

1453
02:36:39.274 --> 02:36:43.107
if Gala condescended to
invite him in writing.


1454
02:36:45.027 --> 02:36:46.620
For 10 years,

1455
02:36:46.622 --> 02:36:50.539
Pubol was a refuge for
her senile debaucheries.


1456
02:36:52.430 --> 02:36:55.427
Of course, Jeff Fenholt.

1457
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:58.118
I saw him once in the theater.

1458
02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:01.786
He was good-looking, but a mediocre actor.

1459
02:37:01.788 --> 02:37:05.656
Gala was in love with
Jeff like a teenager.


1460
02:37:05.658 --> 02:37:08.325
She was 57 years older than him.

1461
02:37:10.825 --> 02:37:13.059
Was his youth that excited her.

1462
02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:15.811
And his life, music, and drugs.

1463
02:37:17.696 --> 02:37:21.687
But that love was no an
obstacle to her promiscuity.


1464
02:37:21.689 --> 02:37:24.239
Gala was quite something.

1465
02:37:24.241 --> 02:37:25.658
What a character.

1466
02:37:26.698 --> 02:37:30.139
Gala bought Jeff a house on Long Island

1467
02:37:30.141 --> 02:37:33.127
for a million and half dollars.

1468
02:37:33.129 --> 02:37:36.212
Gala was Salvador's amulet, his icon.

1469
02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:42.983
He really believed she was the only one

1470
02:37:42.985 --> 02:37:44.855
who could protected him.

1471
02:37:44.857 --> 02:37:45.774
From who?

1472
02:37:47.356 --> 02:37:48.939
Perhaps everyone.

1473
02:37:52.344 --> 02:37:53.336
I never told you this,

1474
02:37:53.338 --> 02:37:56.255
but I saw Gala once eight years ago

1475
02:37:58.395 --> 02:38:02.332
in the lobby of the St.
Regis Hotel in New York.


1476
02:38:02.334 --> 02:38:05.659
John asked me to go with
him on a business trip.


1477
02:38:05.661 --> 02:38:08.190
We have a lot of friends there.

1478
02:38:08.192 --> 02:38:11.408
We were in the lobby
about to go out to dinner,


1479
02:38:11.410 --> 02:38:14.631
when the elevator door opened.

1480
02:38:14.633 --> 02:38:17.033
She was being taken to hospital.

1481
02:38:17.035 --> 02:38:18.985
They had had a fierce argument,

1482
02:38:18.987 --> 02:38:21.570
and Salvador had beaten her up.

1483
02:38:22.833 --> 02:38:25.375
I hardly recognized her.

1484
02:38:25.377 --> 02:38:29.119
He was sobbing, scared
to death in his room,


1485
02:38:29.121 --> 02:38:33.479
interrogated by the police, or
that's what the rumors said.


1486
02:38:33.481 --> 02:38:38.481
I have no idea why she was
brought out in front of everyone.


1487
02:38:40.694 --> 02:38:43.277
Oh, my god, the gold bullion.

1488
02:38:44.319 --> 02:38:49.319
Gala passed away in Port
Lligat, and Salvador's clique


1489
02:38:49.351 --> 02:38:53.124
decided to move the
body in secret to Pubol.


1490
02:38:53.126 --> 02:38:56.834
It was where she wanted to be buried.

1491
02:38:56.836 --> 02:38:58.705
Salvador became deeply depressed.

1492
02:38:58.707 --> 02:39:00.448
He moved to Pubol,

1493
02:39:00.450 --> 02:39:04.200
clinging to Gala's grave
buried in the crypt.


1494
02:39:05.342 --> 02:39:08.670
He was suffering from attacks of paranoia.

1495
02:39:08.672 --> 02:39:11.922
He was in the
final stages of his life.

1496
02:39:12.757 --> 02:39:17.174
I asked to see him, but
he didn't want that.


1497
02:39:17.176 --> 02:39:19.676
"Not my family, they hate me."

1498
02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:23.969
He had a serious accident,

1499
02:39:23.971 --> 02:39:28.319
and was taken to the
Pilar Clinic in Barcelona.


1500
02:39:28.321 --> 02:39:30.071
He called me to come.

1501
02:39:31.373 --> 02:39:33.869
I didn't know what to expect.

1502
02:39:33.871 --> 02:39:37.371
I would prefer to have avoided that visit.

1503
02:39:39.604 --> 02:39:43.396
The burns were affecting 18% of his body

1504
02:39:43.398 --> 02:39:46.201
and he only weighed 40 kilos.

1505
02:39:46.203 --> 02:39:50.370
He looked so pitiful with
that nasal-gastric drip.


1506
02:39:52.674 --> 02:39:56.757
We hadn't seen each other
for more than 30 years.


1507
02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:31.625
He got them to take him
to the Galatea Tower


1508
02:40:31.627 --> 02:40:34.066
at his museum in Figueres,

1509
02:40:34.068 --> 02:40:37.401
to Daliland, not to Cadaques, not Pubol.

1510
02:40:40.059 --> 02:40:43.749
He wanted to be
laid to rest in glory,

1511
02:40:43.751 --> 02:40:46.751
but totally on his own, like an owl.

1512
02:40:49.351 --> 02:40:52.666
The king had made him marquess
in perpetuity, as usual,


1513
02:40:52.668 --> 02:40:55.335
but after a year, 
Salvador asked

1514
02:40:56.376 --> 02:40:58.847
that the it should be made personal

1515
02:40:58.849 --> 02:41:01.771
and for his lifetime only.

1516
02:41:01.773 --> 02:41:05.190
The title of marquess would end with him.

1517
02:41:06.411 --> 02:41:09.532
Unheard of, unprecedented.

1518
02:41:09.534 --> 02:41:10.914
In the tabloid press,

1519
02:41:10.916 --> 02:41:13.984
it was reported that he had
been very well embalmed,


1520
02:41:13.986 --> 02:41:17.047
that he could last for 200 years.

1521
02:41:17.049 --> 02:41:19.656
The press in Madrid celebrated.

1522
02:41:19.658 --> 02:41:22.325
Dali has disinherited Catalonia.

1523
02:41:23.812 --> 02:41:27.208
Even in England, that
was considered a betrayal.


1524
02:41:27.210 --> 02:41:30.481
The Catalan President said,
"We know that we were tricked,


1525
02:41:30.483 --> 02:41:33.779
"but we do not
know who was behind it."

1526
02:41:33.781 --> 02:41:38.499
The whole lot for the Spanish
state, nothing for Catalonia.


1527
02:41:38.501 --> 02:41:40.464
Why did he do it?

1528
02:41:40.466 --> 02:41:45.466
Today you've explained to
me that you have come through.


1529
02:41:45.668 --> 02:41:47.794
Do you not realize?

1530
02:41:47.796 --> 02:41:49.379
What do you mean?

1531
02:41:50.519 --> 02:41:53.544
Do you remember what we
were taught at Cambridge?


1532
02:41:53.546 --> 02:41:56.674
Secret of life is to be yourself?

1533
02:41:56.676 --> 02:42:00.189
In this wild, beautiful landscape,

1534
02:42:00.191 --> 02:42:02.799
with all that you have suffered,

1535
02:42:02.801 --> 02:42:05.066
you have defended your world

1536
02:42:05.068 --> 02:42:09.002
despite all the blunders
your brother made.


1537
02:42:09.004 --> 02:42:10.751
I don't know.

1538
02:42:10.753 --> 02:42:12.718
You don't know?

1539
02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:14.553
Look how it has ended.

1540
02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:17.000
You have survived.

1541
02:42:18.521 --> 02:42:20.685
You have been yourself.

1542
02:42:20.687 --> 02:42:24.854
You have been true to
yourself, and that's enough.


1543
02:42:27.085 --> 02:42:27.916
From my family,

1544
02:42:27.918 --> 02:42:31.642
only my cousin Montserrat
went to the funeral.


1545
02:42:31.644 --> 02:42:33.061
I was ill in bed.

1546
02:42:34.257 --> 02:42:38.886
I had a Mass said for him.

1547
02:42:45.771 --> 02:42:48.619
Anna Maria, I will be back next summer.

1548
02:42:48.621 --> 02:42:50.226
John has promised.

1549
02:42:50.228 --> 02:42:52.925
I will spend three weeks here.

1550
02:42:52.927 --> 02:42:56.726
Who knows if I will still be here.

1551
02:42:56.728 --> 02:42:59.286
You have to get through the mourning.

1552
02:42:59.288 --> 02:43:01.524
Now you must take care of yourself.

1553
02:43:01.526 --> 02:43:03.109
You have good help.

1554
02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:04.873
Ciao.

1555
02:43:07.869 --> 02:43:09.202
Gracias, Emilia.

1556
02:43:10.308 --> 02:43:11.141
Ciao.

1557
02:43:15.593 --> 02:43:18.466
Come to London for a few days.

1558
02:43:18.468 --> 02:43:20.744
You need a change of scene.

1559
02:43:20.746 --> 02:43:22.663
We'll have a good time.

1560
02:43:25.542 --> 02:43:27.542
See you soon, Miss Dali.

1561
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:49.003
Merci, Emilia.

1562
02:43:54.947 --> 02:43:56.847
Is there a
telephone in the lobby?


1563
02:43:56.849 --> 02:43:59.180
I don't want to disturb my husband,

1564
02:43:59.182 --> 02:44:01.562
he may already be asleep.

1565
02:44:05.989 --> 02:44:06.820
Emilia.

1566
02:44:18.848 --> 02:44:19.681
Oh.

1567
02:44:26.846 --> 02:44:28.449
Maggie.

1568
02:44:28.451 --> 02:44:30.177
Hello, Maggie.

1569
02:44:30.179 --> 02:44:32.790
It's 11:00, I'm in Barcelona.

1570
02:44:32.792 --> 02:44:34.951
I didn't want you to worry.

1571
02:44:34.953 --> 02:44:38.453
You made in two
hours, you are a wonder.

1572
02:44:40.863 --> 02:44:43.030
I was so happy to see you.

1573
02:44:43.904 --> 02:44:44.737
Me too.

1574
02:44:45.775 --> 02:44:47.691
Rest, Anna Maria.

1575
02:44:47.693 --> 02:44:49.514
I'll see you soon.

1576
02:44:49.516 --> 02:44:50.692
Goodnight.

1577
02:44:50.694 --> 02:44:52.656
Bye, Anna Maria.

1578
02:44:52.658 --> 02:44:54.158
Goodbye, Maggie.

1579
02:45:14.962 --> 02:45:18.724
The wind of imagination
swells the sails of thought


1580
02:45:18.726 --> 02:45:22.395
and cuts through the water
like the bow of a ship,


1581
02:45:22.397 --> 02:45:26.424
just as if the present
penetrated the future


1582
02:45:26.426 --> 02:45:29.259
leaving behind a trace of anxiety.

1583
02:45:43.959 --> 02:45:46.209
What happened to our lives?

1584
02:45:47.253 --> 02:45:50.170
They just passed by, and that's it.

1585
02:45:52.632 --> 02:45:57.241
None of us had the slightest
premonition of our tragedy.


1586
02:45:57.243 --> 02:46:01.826
It was there all the time
and we were unable to see it.


1587
02:46:04.028 --> 02:46:08.195
Despite all the odds, life
was joyfully beautiful.


1588
02:46:11.301 --> 02:46:14.218
Now, there is nothing else to tell.

1589
02:46:26.225 --> 02:46:31.225
