00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.223
I know we haven't
been together that long,


2
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.644
but these last ten months have
just been the happiest of my life.


3
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.982
You're not only the person I love,
you're also my best friend,


4
00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:36.694
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.


5
00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:40.656
Will you marry me?

6
00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:42.950
Yes.

7
00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:45.578
Seriously.
Do you think that sounds good?


8
00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:47.830
– No!
– Really?


9
00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:51.083
– 'Cause I think that kinda sums up…
– No!


10
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.210
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

11
00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:56.547
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.


12
00:02:56.714 --> 00:02:58.883
Well, thanks for listening.
I really appreciate it.


13
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.554
You've got a real
gentle touch there, doctor.


14
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:05.848
She won't be able to say no.

15
00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:10.186
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.


16
00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.191
– Good luck, Greg.
– Thanks, Kim.


17
00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:16.358
Good luck, buddy.

18
00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:25.910
OK, it's time
for our problem of the week.


19
00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:28.746
I want you to pick out your problem,

20
00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.582
a problem that's been
bothering you all week,


21
00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.960
with your eyes still closed…

22
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.506
…I want you to picture that problem
in your mind.


23
00:03:38.672 --> 00:03:41.258
Pretend that it's right there
in front of you.


24
00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:43.677
Not only are you my best friend,

25
00:03:43.844 --> 00:03:46.931
but you're also the person I
wanna spend the rest of my life with.


26
00:03:48.057 --> 00:03:51.894
I love you.
Will you… marry me?


27
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:56.732
Now I want you to scare your
problems away. I want you to say, «boo.»


28
00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.943
Boo.

29
00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.403
– Boo!
– Boo!


30
00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.366
All right, you guys are great.

31
00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:08.702
Very good. I will see you guys
after lunch, all right?


32
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:11.455
Hey, Pam, isn't that
your special friend outside?


33
00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:15.251
Yeah, I think so.

34
00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:17.294
Why don't you go talk to him?

35
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.047
– You think I should?
– Yeah.


36
00:04:23.884 --> 00:04:24.885
Come here.

37
00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:29.807
– Hi, sweetie.
– How you doin'?


38
00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:32.309
– What's going on?
– I just was in the neighborhood.


39
00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:34.937
Got off work early. Thought maybe
you wanted to get a bite to eat.


40
00:04:35.104 --> 00:04:37.940
Oh, that's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.


41
00:04:39.024 --> 00:04:41.569
Oh, shoot, I forgot to change my shoes.

42
00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:44.863
You don't have to change. I can't
resist a man in nurse's shoes.


43
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.241
I know, but I got sneakers
in my backpack.


44
00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:50.369
– It'll just take a second.
– OK.


45
00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:52.913
Honey…

46
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.499
– Pam, I love you.
– Yeah?


47
00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.961
I love you, too.
Come on, sweetie.


48
00:04:59.128 --> 00:05:02.339
I got a half hour before I have to be
back, so you wanna go have lunch?


49
00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:07.595
– What are you doing?
– Nothing.


50
00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:10.139
I just love you so much.

51
00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:14.184
These last ten months have been
the happiest of my life.


52
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:18.397
Yeah, they've been amazing.
What's going on?


53
00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:22.943
Nothing. I just…
I just feel like we're so close.


54
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.822
You're my best friend, and you're
also the woman that I love, and…


55
00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:29.366
Are you OK, sweetie?
You're acting so weird.


56
00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:31.118
I'm fine.
I just got a crick in my neck.


57
00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:34.163
I was doing CPR on a 300 pound
crack addict this morning.


58
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.873
Want me to massage your neck
or something?


59
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.541
– No, no, no, I'm fine, I'm good.
– A back rub? Are you sure?


60
00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:39.627
Your kids, they're trying
to tell you something.


61
00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:42.129
– What? Hold on.
– Look!


62
00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:44.965
– Oh, it's my sister. Hello? Hi!
<i>– I'm engaged!</i>


63
00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:47.259
<i>Bob and I are getting married
in two weeks!</i>


64
00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:50.012
You're engaged! That's wonderful.
Congratulations!


65
00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:54.558
Oh, my God, you're getting married
in two weeks. That's a little soon.


66
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:58.729
Wow, Mom and Dad really don't know
Bob very well. Dad was OK with this?


67
00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:02.191
<i>– Well, Bob asked Dad.</i>
– Wow, that was very thoughtful of him.


68
00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:04.777
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.


69
00:06:05.861 --> 00:06:07.279
Yeah.

70
00:06:07.446 --> 00:06:11.408
I'm just here with Greg. He's gonna
take me out for lunch. He's OK.


71
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:14.078
OK, yeah, I know you gotta go.
All right. I love you.


72
00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:15.788
OK, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

73
00:06:16.413 --> 00:06:18.791
So what's going on? What?
Debbie's marrying that guy?


74
00:06:18.957 --> 00:06:23.253
Yeah, in two weeks. Dr. Bob of Denver.
Isn't that great?


75
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.216
Yeah, yeah, that's… Didn't they
just meet like a few months ago?


76
00:06:27.383 --> 00:06:29.593
Well, yeah, but, you know,
he asked her, and she said yes.


77
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.845
He asked my dad. He said yes.
Then he asked Debbie.


78
00:06:32.012 --> 00:06:35.766
Yeah, I overheard that. So, what,
like he had to ask his permission?


79
00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:37.935
No, no, he didn't have to.

80
00:06:38.102 --> 00:06:41.313
Bob understood that Dad appreciates
that kind of thing, you know?


81
00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:44.900
Anyway, Deb said
that Dad's crazy about him.


82
00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:48.237
Evidently, Bob bought him
the perfect gift that won him over.


83
00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:51.115
– You know?
– Really? A gift?


84
00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:54.493
Are you sure it's OK to X-ray this?

85
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.787
Yeah, it's not gonna mutate or anything.

86
00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:03.127
– Sir, that's not gonna fit.
– Wait. Hang on a second.


87
00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:06.714
The bag's too big, guy.
You gotta check it.


88
00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:09.550
Over here.

89
00:07:09.717 --> 00:07:11.802
– Raise your arms, sir.
– Look.


90
00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.430
I've got an engagement ring
for my girlfriend in the bag.


91
00:07:14.596 --> 00:07:17.558
I can't really open it here.
Don't you think I can just carry it on?


92
00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:19.852
Hey, pal, if it ain't
fittin' through the frame,


93
00:07:20.018 --> 00:07:22.396
you ain't carryin' it on the plane.

94
00:07:22.563 --> 00:07:26.066
– 531. New York La Guardia. Check it.
– Wait, wait!


95
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:28.026
– Excuse me!
– Don't worry, pal.


96
00:07:28.193 --> 00:07:30.320
It'll be waitin' for you
on the other side.


97
00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:37.828
<i>Welcome to New York's
La Guardia Airport.</i>


98
00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:49.006
Excuse me. Hi.

99
00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:51.925
You lost my bag, and there's
a two-carat diamond ring inside it.


100
00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:54.011
I didn't lose your anything, sir.

101
00:07:54.178 --> 00:07:58.015
But put your local address on this form,
and we'll ship it when it surfaces.


102
00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:00.642
What if it doesn't? Am I supposed
to spend the entire weekend


103
00:08:00.809 --> 00:08:02.519
with just the clothes on my back?

104
00:08:06.565 --> 00:08:09.359
It's a great gift. I just thought
you were gonna get them champagne.


105
00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:12.362
I think your dad is gonna be
very psyched about this gift.


106
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:14.531
Well, don't forget he's retired, though.

107
00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:18.202
The guy was in the rare-flower business.
I think he still maintains an interest.


108
00:08:18.368 --> 00:08:21.413
You make it sound like
they're really hard to please.


109
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.706
No, not at all!

110
00:08:22.873 --> 00:08:25.417
He's the sweetest man
in the whole world. Just relax!


111
00:08:25.584 --> 00:08:29.546
– He's gonna love you. I promise.
– As much as he loves Dr. Bob?


112
00:08:29.713 --> 00:08:33.175
Take it easy on the sarcasm.
Humor is entirely wasted on my parents.


113
00:08:33.342 --> 00:08:35.677
What, are they Amish?

114
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:41.141
OK, no jokes.

115
00:08:43.894 --> 00:08:45.562
– What are you doing?
– What?


116
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:48.857
I told you my dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.


117
00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:50.484
OK, all right,
I'll leave 'em in the car.


118
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.611
No, no, no, no, he'll check there.

119
00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:54.863
– Oh, gosh.
– What…


120
00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:00.160
Yeah, the roof is
probably a better idea.


121
00:09:00.327 --> 00:09:02.079
Hey. Oh, and…

122
00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:04.873
…we're not living together.

123
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.918
– I thought you said you told him.
– Well…


124
00:09:09.336 --> 00:09:12.172
– Hi, Daddy! Hi!
– Sweet pea!


125
00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:16.134
– I missed you so much, Pamcake.
– I missed you too, Flapjack.


126
00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:23.225
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!


127
00:09:24.101 --> 00:09:26.895
Short stack, short stack, coming up.

128
00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:30.774
Where's my «wittle» girl?

129
00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:35.112
– Mommy! Mom!
– You look so beautiful.


130
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:37.698
So do you. Look at you.

131
00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:40.033
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.


132
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.327
Hi, Greg.
I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.


133
00:09:42.494 --> 00:09:43.453
Great to finally meet you.

134
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.206
– Good meeting you.
– And I'm Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay.


135
00:09:46.373 --> 00:09:49.668
Oh…

136
00:09:52.254 --> 00:09:53.797
What are you driving there, a Ford?

137
00:09:54.798 --> 00:09:56.800
Oh, yeah, it's a Taurus.

138
00:09:56.967 --> 00:10:00.721
We were gonna get a mid-size, but I
figure, hey, we pull down decent bucks.


139
00:10:00.887 --> 00:10:04.308
Might as well go all out,
pop for the full-size.


140
00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:07.269
Sure. Interesting color. You pick it?

141
00:10:07.436 --> 00:10:10.147
Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why?

142
00:10:10.314 --> 00:10:13.817
Well, they say geniuses pick green.

143
00:10:13.984 --> 00:10:17.779
– But you didn't pick it.
– Jack!


144
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:22.659
Oh, yucky. What smells
of old sour milk?


145
00:10:22.826 --> 00:10:25.704
– Poor Greg got spit up on by a baby.
– He didn't.


146
00:10:25.871 --> 00:10:29.291
He did, Ma, at the lost luggage
counter. The airline lost his bag.


147
00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:31.001
They didn't!

148
00:10:31.168 --> 00:10:32.628
– Yeah.
– Yeah, they did.


149
00:10:32.794 --> 00:10:35.047
– What about you, honey?
– Oh, no. I carried on.


150
00:10:35.213 --> 00:10:36.840
That's my girl.

151
00:10:39.092 --> 00:10:40.177
It'll turn up, I'm sure.

152
00:10:40.344 --> 00:10:44.348
And anyway, Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask.


153
00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:48.268
– That's right. <i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>
– Oh, thanks, Jack. You too.


154
00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:50.729
Yeah.

155
00:10:52.814 --> 00:10:55.734
– Hey, Mom, the house looks great.
– Really? Oh, good.


156
00:10:55.901 --> 00:10:59.029
– We spruced up for the wedding.
– This is so nice.


157
00:10:59.196 --> 00:11:02.366
– We like it.
– Beautiful.


158
00:11:02.532 --> 00:11:06.703
Oh, now, Greg, you have
a very unique last name.


159
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.458
We were curious,
how do you pronounce it?


160
00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:14.044
Oh, just like it's spelled.

161
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:16.755
F
-O
-C
-K
-E
-R.

162
00:11:18.423 --> 00:11:22.469
– Focker.
– Focker.


163
00:11:25.973 --> 00:11:28.642
– Oh, I'll get it, honey.
– Oh, thanks, Mom.


164
00:11:30.352 --> 00:11:32.979
– There he is. There's our little guy.
– Jinxy, come here, boy.


165
00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:36.983
Come here, baby. Come to Daddy, Jinxy.
Come on. Come on, Jinxy.


166
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.236
– Come here. Come to Daddy.
– Jinxy!


167
00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:42.239
Come on.
Taught him that in one week.


168
00:11:42.406 --> 00:11:46.743
This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.
Jinxy, say hello to Greg.


169
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.161
– Wave to Greg.
– Hello, Jinx.


170
00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:51.331
Attaboy.
That took me another week.


171
00:11:51.498 --> 00:11:54.251
– Oh, my gosh.
– Pam, I didn't know you had a cat.


172
00:11:54.418 --> 00:11:56.503
I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.


173
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.672
Your daddy's found
his new best friend.


174
00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:02.592
You won't believe it.
He even taught him to use the potty.


175
00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:05.595
– He did? Dad, that's kinda weird.
– What's so weird about it?


176
00:12:05.762 --> 00:12:07.597
Now we don't have to smell kitty litter.

177
00:12:07.764 --> 00:12:08.807
– That's right.
– Right?


178
00:12:08.974 --> 00:12:12.060
That's incredible. How did you
teach the cat to use the toilet?


179
00:12:12.227 --> 00:12:13.478
Oh, that was easy, Greg.

180
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.189
I just designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet,


181
00:12:16.356 --> 00:12:18.859
and then once he got used to it,
I took it away.


182
00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:21.361
– Yeah, makes sense.
– I don't think he likes it.


183
00:12:21.528 --> 00:12:24.781
I mean, every chance he gets,
he tries to dig, squat and bury.


184
00:12:24.948 --> 00:12:27.451
I had to move
all my potted plants off the floor.


185
00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:31.163
Plus, you got another guy around
the house to leave the seat up.


186
00:12:32.873 --> 00:12:35.959
He can't lift the seat, Greg.

187
00:12:36.126 --> 00:12:38.295
He lacks the strength
and the opposable thumbs.


188
00:12:38.462 --> 00:12:42.632
Ah, right. Opposable…
I didn't think about that.


189
00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:43.884
Jinx is strictly a house cat.

190
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:46.678
Can't let him outside because
he lacks outdoor survival skills.


191
00:12:46.845 --> 00:12:48.805
One of those things,
isn't it, sweetheart?


192
00:12:48.972 --> 00:12:52.809
I don't think Greg will be playing
with Jinxy too much. He hates cats.


193
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.813
Pam, I don't hate cats.

194
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.816
I don't hate cats. I just happen
to be more of a dog lover.


195
00:12:59.983 --> 00:13:02.027
– Yeah, yeah.
– I am too.


196
00:13:02.194 --> 00:13:03.737
Well, that's OK
if you hate cats, Greg.


197
00:13:03.904 --> 00:13:07.240
No! I don't.
I don't hate cats at all.


198
00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:11.578
That's OK. Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.


199
00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:14.581
I… I'm being honest.
Really? Like what?


200
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.086
Honey, why don't we let
the kids freshen up, huh?


201
00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:20.670
Greg, you come with me.

202
00:13:20.837 --> 00:13:23.673
We'll get you something to wear
from Jack's closet, OK?


203
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.176
– OK.
– Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey.


204
00:13:26.343 --> 00:13:29.805
– Yeah?
– I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart.


205
00:13:30.847 --> 00:13:32.140
Me too, Daddy.

206
00:13:34.351 --> 00:13:39.481
Hey, listen, be nice to this one,
OK? I kinda like him.


207
00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:42.859
– OK, I'll try.
– Thank you.


208
00:13:50.992 --> 00:13:53.537
– Shirt fit OK, Greg?
– Oh, fantastic. Thanks, Jack.


209
00:13:53.703 --> 00:13:55.580
Good. Tom Collins coming up.

210
00:13:55.747 --> 00:13:58.208
You know, I wish you hadn't
told your parents I hate cats.


211
00:13:58.375 --> 00:13:59.626
But you do hate cats.

212
00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:01.795
You didn't have to tell them
right when we met.


213
00:14:01.962 --> 00:14:03.797
I know. I'm sorry.
It just kinda slipped out.


214
00:14:03.964 --> 00:14:08.552
Get your red-hot pu-pus.
My goodness, what is that?


215
00:14:08.718 --> 00:14:13.974
Oh, that's just a little something
from me. Go ahead. Open it up.


216
00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:17.686
Look, honey,
Greg brought us a present.


217
00:14:17.894 --> 00:14:19.771
Oh, isn't that nice?

218
00:14:25.402 --> 00:14:29.406
Oh, look at this. It's a flowerpot
with the dirt in it.


219
00:14:30.782 --> 00:14:34.744
Actually, the real gift
is what's planted in the soil.


220
00:14:34.911 --> 00:14:38.331
The bulb of a Jerusalem tulip.

221
00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:45.630
Which I was told is one of the rarest
and most beautiful flowers in existence.


222
00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:50.010
Oh, right, right, the Jerusalem…

223
00:14:50.177 --> 00:14:53.638
…from the <i>jerusales tulipesias</i>
genus. Yes, yes.


224
00:14:54.764 --> 00:14:58.894
Anyway, yeah, the guy said
with regular watering,


225
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.520
it should bloom in about
six months, so…


226
00:15:00.687 --> 00:15:03.356
Oh, we'll look forward to that, Greg.

227
00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:14.868
So, Greg, how's your job?

228
00:15:15.035 --> 00:15:18.496
Good, Pam. Thanks for asking.

229
00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:22.375
I… I recently
got transferred to triage.


230
00:15:22.542 --> 00:15:24.377
Oh, is that better than a nurse?

231
00:15:24.544 --> 00:15:27.547
No, Mom, triage is
a unit of the E.R.

232
00:15:27.714 --> 00:15:29.841
– It's where all the top nurses work.
– Well…


233
00:15:30.008 --> 00:15:32.135
No, they do.

234
00:15:33.762 --> 00:15:35.764
Not many men in your profession,
though, are there, Greg?


235
00:15:37.474 --> 00:15:40.477
No, Jack, not traditionally.

236
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.608
Oh, Pam, honey, did you know that
your father started his own business?


237
00:15:46.775 --> 00:15:50.153
– Really? Dad, that's great.
– Oh, wow!


238
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.572
Yes, I thought with
my knowledge and experience,


239
00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:54.574
why should I allow
retirement to stop me?


240
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:57.243
– I really admire that.
– Yeah.


241
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.996
So what is it?
What's the new venture?


242
00:16:00.163 --> 00:16:04.542
Let me ask you a question, Greg.
Let's just say you have kids


243
00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:08.546
and you wanna get out of the house,
spend a night on the town. You know?


244
00:16:08.713 --> 00:16:11.258
So you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.


245
00:16:11.424 --> 00:16:14.177
References, work experience…
it all checks out fine.


246
00:16:14.344 --> 00:16:17.347
But then how do you
really know for certain


247
00:16:17.514 --> 00:16:20.684
that your loved ones are safe
with this stranger?


248
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.521
I mean, can you ever really trust
another human being, Greg?


249
00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:31.736
– Sure, I think so.
– No, the answer is you cannot.


250
00:16:33.697 --> 00:16:38.159
Let me show you something.
Take a look at this, Greg.


251
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.373
What's this look like to you?

252
00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:46.293
This looks like a teddy bear.

253
00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:49.671
Smile, you're on «nanny camera.»

254
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.341
Oh, yeah, yeah! I've seen
these things advertised on TV.


255
00:16:53.508 --> 00:16:56.052
Oh, no, not like this, you haven't.
Take a look.


256
00:16:57.512 --> 00:17:01.391
Oh, my gosh. Hi!
Where's the other camera?


257
00:17:01.558 --> 00:17:04.227
Right here in this decorative artifact.

258
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.564
– Wow, that's great.
– Our cameras are motion-activated,


259
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:10.150
so they begin taping as soon
as they sense any movement.


260
00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:14.404
We can hide 'em in anything. Mirrors,
lamps, televisions, you name it.


261
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:16.656
So no matter where you go…

262
00:17:17.657 --> 00:17:19.909
…we'll be watching you.

263
00:17:22.537 --> 00:17:25.081
So, Jack, couldn't this maybe
be construed as illegal?


264
00:17:25.248 --> 00:17:26.666
You know, invasion of privacy?

265
00:17:28.293 --> 00:17:31.254
Trust me, Greg, when you start
having little Fockers running around,


266
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:33.548
you'll understand the need
for this level of protection.


267
00:17:39.763 --> 00:17:41.014
Impressive, isn't it?

268
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:42.182
Quite.

269
00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:47.395
– Oh, I'll get that.
– I'll get it. Honey, I'll get it.


270
00:17:47.604 --> 00:17:49.481
OK.

271
00:17:50.774 --> 00:17:53.151
Any problem with the documents?

272
00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:56.946
OK. I'll meet you at the Oyster Bay
drugstore in about 20 minutes.


273
00:17:57.113 --> 00:17:59.616
Now you gotta be more careful
when you call here.


274
00:17:59.783 --> 00:18:02.160
If anybody else answers,
just use a Southern accent


275
00:18:02.327 --> 00:18:04.496
and ask for the vegetarian special, OK?

276
00:18:05.872 --> 00:18:08.124
Wow. All this
and the wedding's on Sunday?


277
00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:12.128
– Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it?
– Nope, wrong number.


278
00:18:12.295 --> 00:18:15.715
We're all out of Collins mix,
so I'm gonna make a run to the store.


279
00:18:15.882 --> 00:18:18.093
That's funny.
I thought I just bought some.


280
00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:21.554
You know how that stuff,
it just goes, so I'll be back in a jiff.


281
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:23.973
Well, why doesn't Greg go with you?

282
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:29.604
Sweetie, you'll need something in case
your suitcase doesn't show up.


283
00:18:29.771 --> 00:18:32.232
– Oh, I'm sure it'll show up.
– Yeah.


284
00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:35.026
You don't wanna take a chance.
You don't have a toothbrush.


285
00:18:35.193 --> 00:18:37.529
– Go on, sweetie.
– Yeah.


286
00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:40.323
OK, unless you want some privacy.

287
00:18:41.282 --> 00:18:46.246
– Why would I need privacy?
– No, I didn't think you would.


288
00:18:46.412 --> 00:18:48.665
– OK, let's head out.
– Oh, good.


289
00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:51.835
Bye.

290
00:18:52.001 --> 00:18:56.131
Have fun, you guys.
Pam, he seems wonderful.


291
00:18:56.297 --> 00:18:59.926
– He is. We have the best time together.
– Good.


292
00:19:00.093 --> 00:19:01.761
Now, have you two been…?

293
00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:05.515
– Mother!
– Thinking about anything permanent.


294
00:19:05.682 --> 00:19:09.102
Oh, I don't know. I mean,
we haven't really discussed it,


295
00:19:09.269 --> 00:19:12.063
but I definitely
have a feeling this is it.


296
00:19:13.189 --> 00:19:16.025
Dad seems to like him.
Don't you think?


297
00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:18.194
Absolutely.

298
00:19:23.533 --> 00:19:25.535
– Big day, Saturday.
– This car…


299
00:19:25.702 --> 00:19:28.997
Yes. This car is…

300
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.626
You got… What do you use?
Unleaded? Regular unleaded?


301
00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:35.253
Premium.

302
00:19:40.216 --> 00:19:44.679
Hey, you know, Jack, now that
we have a second to talk,


303
00:19:44.846 --> 00:19:48.224
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.


304
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:50.351
I know that we haven't
been together that long,


305
00:19:50.518 --> 00:19:54.731
but the time that we have spent
together has been really incredible.


306
00:19:54.898 --> 00:19:56.482
Greg, how come you don't like cats?

307
00:19:59.861 --> 00:20:04.866
I don't not like cats.
I just… I just prefer dogs.


308
00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:08.369
I mean, I'm just more
of a dog kind of, you know…


309
00:20:09.037 --> 00:20:14.250
Come home, wagging their little tails,
happy to see you kind of…


310
00:20:14.417 --> 00:20:19.088
You need that assurance, do you? You
prefer an emotionally shallow animal?


311
00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:21.090
I…

312
00:20:21.257 --> 00:20:23.551
You see, Greg,
when you yell at a dog,


313
00:20:23.718 --> 00:20:26.054
his tail will go between his legs
and cover his genitals,


314
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:27.680
his ears will go down.

315
00:20:27.847 --> 00:20:31.017
A dog is very easy to break, but cats
make you work for their affection.


316
00:20:31.184 --> 00:20:32.894
They don't sell out the way dogs do.

317
00:20:41.778 --> 00:20:43.446
You like Peter, 
Paul and Mary?

318
00:20:46.199 --> 00:20:49.536
Yes, I do. I'm a big fan.

319
00:20:56.292 --> 00:21:00.505
– Great song.
– Yeah, one of my favorites.


320
00:21:00.672 --> 00:21:03.758
Who would've thought it wasn't
really about a dragon, huh?


321
00:21:05.468 --> 00:21:07.053
What do you mean?

322
00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:11.140
You know, the whole drug thing.

323
00:21:12.892 --> 00:21:14.978
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?


324
00:21:17.438 --> 00:21:20.650
Some people think that…

325
00:21:21.776 --> 00:21:24.153
…to «Puff the Magic Dragon»
means to…


326
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.738
They're really…

327
00:21:27.824 --> 00:21:30.535
To smoke… to smoke…

328
00:21:30.702 --> 00:21:33.663
A marijuana cigarette.

329
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:37.500
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.


330
00:21:38.668 --> 00:21:40.628
Right.

331
00:21:44.132 --> 00:21:46.509
– Are you a pothead, Focker?
– No! No.


332
00:21:46.676 --> 00:21:50.847
What? No, no, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm, I'm not… I…


333
00:21:51.014 --> 00:21:53.516
I pass on grass all the time.

334
00:21:53.683 --> 00:21:55.685
– I mean, not all the time.
– Yes or no, Greg?


335
00:21:55.852 --> 00:21:57.228
No. Yes. No.

336
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.697
Look, Greg, I'll meet you back
out front in about 12 to 15 minutes.


337
00:22:07.864 --> 00:22:09.824
OK.

338
00:22:28.551 --> 00:22:31.054
– Hey. Hi.
– Hey. How you doing? Hey.


339
00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.598
Do you have any of those
nicotine patches?


340
00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:37.018
No. We have the gum.

341
00:22:39.646 --> 00:22:42.231
– Great.
– You chew it.


342
00:22:42.398 --> 00:22:45.735
Thank you. Yes, OK. And what's your
most expensive bottle of champagne?


343
00:22:45.902 --> 00:22:49.030
Mumm's. It's on sale for 13.95.

344
00:22:49.197 --> 00:22:51.074
Really? That's it?
You don't have, like,


345
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.910
a nice, like, 80 or $100 bottle
of something?


346
00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:57.872
You can get
a whole bunch of Mumm's.


347
00:23:32.615 --> 00:23:35.034
– Focker.
– Hey, Jack. Ready to go?


348
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:39.330
I've been ready, yeah.
They ran out of Collins mix.


349
00:23:40.957 --> 00:23:44.961
– You been waiting here long?
– No, I was just reading up about…


350
00:23:47.296 --> 00:23:50.591
– …pumps.
– Pumps?


351
00:23:50.758 --> 00:23:54.137
Yes. Breast pumps.

352
00:23:55.972 --> 00:23:58.766
I grew up on a farm.

353
00:24:05.064 --> 00:24:07.150
Get your hot buns, hot patooties.

354
00:24:07.316 --> 00:24:09.986
Wow, Dina,
everything looks fabulous.


355
00:24:10.153 --> 00:24:13.489
It's such a treat for me to have
a home-cooked meal like this.


356
00:24:13.656 --> 00:24:15.992
Dinner at my house usually consisted
of everybody in the kitchen


357
00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:17.994
fighting over containers
of Chinese food.


358
00:24:18.161 --> 00:24:21.914
You poor thing. What, there
wasn't enough food to go around?


359
00:24:22.081 --> 00:24:26.294
No, there was. We just never really
sat down like a family like this.


360
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.256
Greg, would you like to say grace?

361
00:24:31.632 --> 00:24:34.177
Oh, well, Greg's Jewish, Dad.
You know that.


362
00:24:34.343 --> 00:24:37.096
You're telling me Jews
don't pray, honey?


363
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:41.893
– Unless you have some objection.
– No, no, no, no, I'd love to.


364
00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:43.978
Pam, come on, it's not like
I'm a rabbi or something.


365
00:24:44.145 --> 00:24:47.523
I've said grace at many a dinner table.

366
00:24:53.112 --> 00:24:54.197
Let's…

367
00:24:56.532 --> 00:24:57.867
OK.

368
00:25:00.828 --> 00:25:04.373
O dear God…

369
00:25:06.542 --> 00:25:08.127
…thank you.

370
00:25:09.712 --> 00:25:14.050
You are such a good God to us,
a kind and gentle…


371
00:25:14.217 --> 00:25:19.680
…and accommodating God.

372
00:25:19.847 --> 00:25:25.019
And we thank you, O sweet,
sweet Lord of hosts…


373
00:25:25.186 --> 00:25:27.063
…for the…

374
00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:32.235
…smorgasbord you have so aptly

375
00:25:32.401 --> 00:25:35.404
lain at our table this day…

376
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:39.367
…and each day… by day.

377
00:25:41.702 --> 00:25:44.163
Day by day by day.

378
00:25:45.581 --> 00:25:51.045
O dear Lord, three things we pray.

379
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.757
To love Thee more dearly,

380
00:25:54.924 --> 00:25:59.387
to see Thee more clearly,

381
00:25:59.554 --> 00:26:02.932
to follow Thee more nearly…

382
00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:07.103
…day by day… by day.

383
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.771
– Amen.
– Amen.


384
00:26:08.938 --> 00:26:11.440
Oh, Greg, that was lovely.

385
00:26:11.607 --> 00:26:15.361
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting, too.


386
00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:26.789
Oh, that's a… That's a lovely vase.
That's great.


387
00:26:26.956 --> 00:26:30.710
Let me guess, Jack. Is that
one of your secret cameras, too?


388
00:26:34.005 --> 00:26:38.718
Greg, Greg. That's an urn which holds
the remains of Jack's mother.


389
00:26:39.885 --> 00:26:43.472
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

390
00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:45.558
That's all right.
You didn't know, Greg.


391
00:26:45.725 --> 00:26:48.811
– I'm…
– That's our gran-gran.


392
00:26:48.978 --> 00:26:53.316
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.


393
00:26:53.482 --> 00:26:55.818
Love you, Ma. Miss you.

394
00:26:55.985 --> 00:26:57.695
Miss you every day.

395
00:26:58.863 --> 00:27:01.115
Oh, honey, why don't you
read Greg your poem?


396
00:27:01.282 --> 00:27:03.326
Oh, no, he doesn't want to hear that.

397
00:27:03.492 --> 00:27:05.328
What? No! What-what-what poem?

398
00:27:05.494 --> 00:27:08.164
You see, when Jack had to retire

399
00:27:08.331 --> 00:27:10.833
– for health reasons…
– That's a bunch of malarky. I'm fine.


400
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.836
The doctor thought it would be
therapeutic if he


401
00:27:14.003 --> 00:27:16.297
sort of expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.


402
00:27:16.464 --> 00:27:20.509
Honey, you wrote the most beautiful
poem about your mother.


403
00:27:20.676 --> 00:27:22.511
Please, we really wanna hear it.

404
00:27:22.678 --> 00:27:25.181
– Poem, poem.
– Please!


405
00:27:25.348 --> 00:27:29.185
Oh, all right.
It's a work in progress.


406
00:27:29.352 --> 00:27:31.646
I'm still not happy with it.

407
00:27:31.812 --> 00:27:34.023
As soon as it's ready,

408
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.985
then I am going to glaze it
onto a plate


409
00:27:38.152 --> 00:27:40.196
– and put it next to the urn.
– Nice.


410
00:27:40.363 --> 00:27:42.156
It's very special.

411
00:27:42.323 --> 00:27:46.535
<i>My Mother</i> by Jack Byrnes.

412
00:27:48.371 --> 00:27:51.040
«You gave me life, you gave me milk

413
00:27:51.207 --> 00:27:53.334
You gave me courage

414
00:27:53.501 --> 00:27:59.298
Your name was Angela
the angel from heaven


415
00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:03.469
But you were also an angel of God
and he needed you too


416
00:28:03.636 --> 00:28:06.847
Selfishly I tried to keep you here

417
00:28:07.014 --> 00:28:09.558
While the cancer ate away your organs

418
00:28:09.725 --> 00:28:11.894
Like an unstoppable rebel force.

419
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:17.733
But I couldn't save you
and I shall see your face…


420
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.029
Nevermore, nevermore

421
00:28:22.196 --> 00:28:24.907
Nevermore…

422
00:28:25.074 --> 00:28:29.245
Until we meet… in heaven»

423
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.915
Daddy, that's beautiful.

424
00:28:33.082 --> 00:28:36.085
– It always gets me.
– Amazing. So…


425
00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:40.840
So much love, yet also
so much information.


426
00:28:42.383 --> 00:28:44.343
It takes a lot out of him.

427
00:28:46.262 --> 00:28:50.349
– Greg, would you like some yams?
– Thank you. Oh, yeah.


428
00:28:50.516 --> 00:28:53.686
You must've had vegetables fresher
than that, growing up on a farm, Greg.


429
00:28:53.853 --> 00:28:57.440
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

430
00:28:57.606 --> 00:28:59.525
He told me he
grew up on a farm.

431
00:29:02.445 --> 00:29:05.656
– Do they have many farms in Detroit?
– No, Dina, no, not a lot.


432
00:29:05.865 --> 00:29:07.700
In fact, Jack, 
I should clarify this.

433
00:29:07.867 --> 00:29:11.954
I didn't actually grow up…
on a farm per se.


434
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:15.583
The house we grew up in
was originally erected


435
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.794
in the early Dutch farm, 
Colonial style.

436
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:22.548
So that, plus we
had a lot of pets…

437
00:29:25.468 --> 00:29:28.345
– Which one did you milk then?
– Dad!


438
00:29:28.512 --> 00:29:33.768
– Honey, he said he pumped milk.
– What have you ever milked?


439
00:29:36.103 --> 00:29:38.272
A cat.

440
00:29:38.439 --> 00:29:41.275
A cat?

441
00:29:41.442 --> 00:29:42.818
I milked a cat once.

442
00:29:42.985 --> 00:29:46.655
– You wanna hear a story?
– Sure.


443
00:29:46.822 --> 00:29:52.328
My sister had a cat, and the cat
birthed a litter of kittens.


444
00:29:52.495 --> 00:29:55.414
Must've been 30 of them,
and there was this one little runt…


445
00:29:55.581 --> 00:29:58.667
this little sweet little…
little-engine-that-could runt


446
00:29:58.834 --> 00:30:02.463
who wanted to get up there and couldn't
really get access to the… to the…


447
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.092
…to the… to the… to the teat.

448
00:30:06.258 --> 00:30:07.968
Teat?

449
00:30:08.135 --> 00:30:09.970
– Dad.
– What have you.


450
00:30:10.137 --> 00:30:15.518
I went in and just simply,
you know, just…


451
00:30:19.104 --> 00:30:22.024
…into a little saucer,

452
00:30:22.191 --> 00:30:26.987
then took the saucer and fed it
to Geppetto… that's what I named him.


453
00:30:27.154 --> 00:30:29.865
I had… I had no idea
you could milk a cat.


454
00:30:30.032 --> 00:30:32.368
Oh, yeah, you can milk
anything with nipples.


455
00:30:35.538 --> 00:30:37.873
I have nipples, Greg.
Could you milk me?


456
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.876
OK, could we change
the subject perhaps?


457
00:30:42.711 --> 00:30:44.505
– Champagne, champagne.
– Yes.


458
00:30:44.672 --> 00:30:46.715
Maybe we could celebrate
with a little bubbly.


459
00:30:46.882 --> 00:30:49.385
That'd be great. Good idea.

460
00:30:58.102 --> 00:31:00.062
«I have nipples. 
Can you milk me?»

461
00:31:00.229 --> 00:31:03.566
Well, in a funny way,
you've already seen Deb's ring.


462
00:31:03.732 --> 00:31:05.860
That's true.

463
00:31:06.026 --> 00:31:07.862
Would anybody care for a bottle

464
00:31:08.028 --> 00:31:11.073
of Oyster Bay Drug and Sundries
finest champagne?


465
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.743
That is so sweet of you, Greg.
Isn't that a nice gesture?


466
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.328
That's very nice.

467
00:31:16.495 --> 00:31:19.039
How could I have seen Debbie's ring?
I haven't been home for months.


468
00:31:19.206 --> 00:31:21.917
Well, when I gave Bob
the OK to propose to Deb,


469
00:31:22.084 --> 00:31:24.086
I put him in
touch with my diamond guy,

470
00:31:24.253 --> 00:31:26.881
and he picked out
the same design Kevin gave you.


471
00:31:29.258 --> 00:31:31.844
– Kevin, your old boyfriend?
– Thanks, Dad.


472
00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:34.263
Well, yeah,
Kevin was Pam's fiance.


473
00:31:41.604 --> 00:31:45.566
Oh, my God. Jinxy, no!

474
00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:47.610
Jinxy, no!

475
00:31:47.776 --> 00:31:49.820
Oh, God.

476
00:31:51.238 --> 00:31:52.072
Shit.

477
00:31:53.782 --> 00:31:57.119
– Greg, sweetie, how you doing?
– Oh, just fine,


478
00:31:57.286 --> 00:32:00.456
considering I desecrated
your grandma's remains,


479
00:32:00.623 --> 00:32:04.668
found out you were engaged and
had your father ask me to milk him.


480
00:32:04.835 --> 00:32:07.046
At least back then he was
still talking to me.


481
00:32:07.254 --> 00:32:09.715
I can't believe you didn't
tell me you were that close.


482
00:32:09.882 --> 00:32:12.801
– Who, Daddy and me?
– No, Kevin and you.


483
00:32:12.968 --> 00:32:14.803
Do we have to know everything
about each other's pasts?


484
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:19.642
You never told me about
your cat-milking days in Motown.


485
00:32:19.808 --> 00:32:21.560
That was a long time ago, Pam.

486
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:23.854
Yeah, OK, well, so was this.

487
00:32:24.021 --> 00:32:29.818
Kevin's and my connection
was more physical than anything else.


488
00:32:29.985 --> 00:32:34.073
Physical? Like what?
Like you worked out together?


489
00:32:34.239 --> 00:32:39.662
No, no, it was nothing, nothing.
It was a stupid sexual thing.


490
00:32:39.828 --> 00:32:41.956
I'm gonna go throw up now.

491
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.793
Greg, listen. Kevin and I
were only engaged for a month


492
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.087
before I realized
that I'd made a mistake, OK?


493
00:32:48.254 --> 00:32:51.048
I… I… I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago,


494
00:32:51.215 --> 00:32:54.677
and I met and fell in love with you,
OK, so can we please drop this?


495
00:32:56.512 --> 00:32:58.847
– OK.
– Good.


496
00:32:59.014 --> 00:33:01.058
I just feel like this is
not going well at all.


497
00:33:01.225 --> 00:33:04.520
– I feel like your dad hates me.
– He doesn't hate you, sweetie.


498
00:33:04.687 --> 00:33:07.398
Come on. Just give him
a chance, all right?


499
00:33:07.564 --> 00:33:09.400
Maybe he's nervous too, huh?

500
00:33:09.566 --> 00:33:13.988
I thought he would love my gift,
you know, being this big flower guy,


501
00:33:14.154 --> 00:33:17.366
but it's like he didn't even show
the slightest bit of interest.


502
00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:21.370
Listen to me. Forget the gift.

503
00:33:21.537 --> 00:33:26.041
You are the most adorable, loving,
sweetest man in the whole world,


504
00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:28.544
and I love you.

505
00:33:28.711 --> 00:33:31.046
And very soon my parents
are gonna see that,


506
00:33:31.213 --> 00:33:35.050
and grow to love you too, OK? OK?

507
00:33:37.678 --> 00:33:40.389
Speaking of growing to love you…

508
00:33:40.556 --> 00:33:42.725
– Honey, it's late. Come on.
– I know it's late.


509
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:45.978
But Mr. Winky is still on Chicago time,

510
00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:49.398
and we both know there's only one way
to make Mr. Winky go away.


511
00:33:49.565 --> 00:33:50.941
Greg?

512
00:33:51.567 --> 00:33:54.737
And there it is.

513
00:33:58.407 --> 00:34:00.492
What's with the robe?

514
00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:04.246
It's Pam's. My pajamas are in
the suitcase with everything else.


515
00:34:04.413 --> 00:34:06.874
Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.

516
00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:08.584
– OK, honey?
– Sure.


517
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:10.419
– You don't have to do that, Dina.
– Oh, no, no.


518
00:34:10.586 --> 00:34:12.254
No, that's fine. We have to.

519
00:34:12.421 --> 00:34:15.090
– Thank you.
– You're welcome.


520
00:34:15.257 --> 00:34:18.635
Look, Greg, I just wanna say, don't
worry about what happened tonight.


521
00:34:19.595 --> 00:34:23.640
Oh, well, thanks, Jack.
Still, I feel horrible. I mean…


522
00:34:24.683 --> 00:34:26.518
Well, it was a horrible thing.

523
00:34:30.064 --> 00:34:34.276
But let's just put all that behind us
and enjoy our weekend together.


524
00:34:35.402 --> 00:34:38.864
– OK. OK.
– Thank you, Daddy.


525
00:34:40.741 --> 00:34:42.284
– Oh, thank you.
– Thanks, Mom.


526
00:34:42.451 --> 00:34:44.119
– These'll do just fine.
– Good night.


527
00:34:44.286 --> 00:34:46.622
Night-night. Why'd you give him
my favorite pair?


528
00:34:46.789 --> 00:34:49.583
– Good night. See you in the morning.
– Good night.


529
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.127
– Have a nice sleep.
– OK, you too.


530
00:34:52.294 --> 00:34:56.965
Oh, no, no, no, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you down in the den.


531
00:34:57.633 --> 00:35:01.970
Oh, OK, 'cause Pam said
I should sleep in Debbie's room.


532
00:35:02.137 --> 00:35:05.265
Well, Debbie'll be
sleeping here tomorrow.


533
00:35:05.432 --> 00:35:07.559
This way, you'll have more privacy,
you'll have your own bathroom.


534
00:35:07.768 --> 00:35:11.313
Just try not to flush the toilet.
It's always a little quirky.


535
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.150
– OK.
– Oh, one more thing.


536
00:35:17.653 --> 00:35:19.738
I'm a realist. I understand
it's the 21st century,


537
00:35:19.905 --> 00:35:23.826
and you've probably had premarital
relations with my daughter.


538
00:35:23.992 --> 00:35:27.496
But under our roof, it's my way
or the Long Island Expressway.


539
00:35:27.663 --> 00:35:30.833
– Is that understood?
– Of course, yeah.


540
00:35:30.999 --> 00:35:34.002
Good. Keep your snake
in its cage for 72 hours.


541
00:35:35.379 --> 00:35:37.214
OK.

542
00:35:41.885 --> 00:35:45.180
<i>Welcome to Atlantic American Airways'
lost luggage department.</i>


543

<i>At Atlantic American Airways, customer
satisfaction always comes first.</i>


544

549
00:36:08.203 --> 00:36:10.205
Sorry.

550
00:36:12.916 --> 00:36:16.712
I don't know what it is, but there's
something about him that's a little off.


551
00:36:16.879 --> 00:36:19.548
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Jack,
you know we've been through this


552
00:36:19.715 --> 00:36:24.595
with every boyfriend Pam has had
since, what, middle school.


553
00:36:24.761 --> 00:36:28.724
I think Greg…
He's a lovely young man.


554
00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:31.894
And, honey, Pam thinks
he might be the one.


555
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.023
She said that?
She said those exact words?


556
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.234
I didn't tape record it, Jack,
but that's the impression.


557
00:36:40.777 --> 00:36:43.489
I just feel sorry, the poor boy
never had a home-cooked meal.


558
00:36:43.655 --> 00:36:47.409
What kind of a family doesn't have time
to sit down for dinner?


559
00:36:47.576 --> 00:36:51.413
– Fugitives.
– Please try to enjoy the weekend.


560
00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.083
– Both our daughters are in love.
– That's what I'm worried about.


561
00:36:59.421 --> 00:37:01.757
– Oh, geez, I just realized something.
– What?


562
00:37:01.924 --> 00:37:04.301
– Pam's middle name.
– Martha.


563
00:37:05.427 --> 00:37:07.262
Oh, no.

564
00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:08.972
Pamela Martha Focker.

565
00:38:09.032 --> 00:38:11.326
«Operation Ko Samui»?

566
00:38:20.836 --> 00:38:22.379
Looking for something, Greg?

567
00:38:24.006 --> 00:38:26.675
Jesus, Jack, you scared me.

568
00:38:26.842 --> 00:38:30.679
I heard a noise, so I came down
to see if everything was OK.


569
00:38:30.846 --> 00:38:32.597
Everything's fine.
I just… I'm sorry.


570
00:38:32.764 --> 00:38:34.558
I saw a light on,
and I kinda stumbled in.


571
00:38:34.725 --> 00:38:37.978
– I didn't realize…
– That's OK. See anything interesting?


572
00:38:38.145 --> 00:38:41.523
No, not at all. I mean, I mean…

573
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:46.153
I mean, this is great, though.
I love this… It's a cozy little nook.


574
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.530
I noticed you were looking
at that when I came in.


575
00:38:50.699 --> 00:38:53.869
– Yeah.
– It's an antique polygraph machine.


576
00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:56.705
Is that what that is?
I've seen these before,


577
00:38:56.872 --> 00:38:58.832
but I never saw one actually up close.

578
00:38:58.999 --> 00:39:00.834
You know what?

579
00:39:02.878 --> 00:39:04.338
Why don't you try that on?

580
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.049
Oh, that's OK.

581
00:39:07.215 --> 00:39:10.177
Oh, come on. We'll have some fun.
I'll show you how it works.


582
00:39:10.344 --> 00:39:12.846
– I… I shouldn't.
– Why should you be afraid?


583
00:39:13.013 --> 00:39:14.890
– You have nothing to hide.
– No, I know.


584
00:39:15.057 --> 00:39:17.893
– So there shouldn't be any problem.
– No, there's no problem.


585
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.605
– So, try it on.
– OK.


586
00:39:21.772 --> 00:39:23.273
I'll help you.

587
00:39:31.573 --> 00:39:33.575
Don't worry. You'll enjoy this.

588
00:39:35.744 --> 00:39:37.996
All right.

589
00:39:39.081 --> 00:39:43.418
Looks complicated. 
Now, these aren't

590
00:39:43.585 --> 00:39:46.254
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.


591
00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:48.924
They can tell fairly easily
if someone's lying or not.


592
00:39:50.467 --> 00:39:52.386
Now I'm gonna ask you some questions,

593
00:39:52.552 --> 00:39:54.763
and all you have to do
is answer «yes» or «no.»


594
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:59.267
– OK.
– All right. Let's give it a whirl.


595
00:40:00.811 --> 00:40:04.481
– Did you fly on an airplane today?
– Yes, I did.


596
00:40:05.774 --> 00:40:08.235
No peeking. Did we eat pot roast

597
00:40:08.402 --> 00:40:11.947
– for dinner tonight?
– Yes.


598
00:40:12.114 --> 00:40:14.032
Was it under-cooked?

599
00:40:17.285 --> 00:40:22.290
No, it was rare.
It was a little rare for my taste.


600
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:26.753
– But I wouldn't…
– I'm just kidding, I'm just…


601
00:40:29.673 --> 00:40:32.426
Relax. Relax.
The needles are jumping.


602
00:40:34.261 --> 00:40:37.764
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?


603
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.063
No.

604
00:40:46.773 --> 00:40:49.818
– I mean, well, I don't…
– Yes or no?


605
00:40:58.869 --> 00:41:02.873
– Hey!
– Hey.


606
00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:08.503
What's the matter? 
You can't sleep?

607
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:11.089
No, no, I'm just going over
some of my answers


608
00:41:11.256 --> 00:41:13.341
from the polygraph test
your dad just gave me.


609
00:41:13.508 --> 00:41:16.136
– Oh, no, he didn't.
– Yeah, he did.


610
00:41:16.303 --> 00:41:18.513
Well, did you lie to him?

611
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.808
No! I mean… Well, he asked me
if we were living together,


612
00:41:21.975 --> 00:41:24.394
– and…
– What'd you tell him?


613
00:41:24.561 --> 00:41:26.480
I… nothing.
Your mother walked in


614
00:41:26.646 --> 00:41:28.690
and yanked the little thingies
off before I had to answer.


615
00:41:29.316 --> 00:41:30.817
This how you'd react if I told you

616
00:41:30.984 --> 00:41:33.028
he shoved bamboo shoots
up my fingernails?


617
00:41:33.195 --> 00:41:37.449
Or does he hook all your boyfriends
up to his little machine?


618
00:41:37.657 --> 00:41:40.785
Well, he doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.


619
00:41:40.994 --> 00:41:42.537
What?

620
00:41:42.704 --> 00:41:45.540
Greg, my father was never
in the rare flower business.


621
00:41:45.707 --> 00:41:48.543
That was just his cover.

622
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.546
He was in the CIA for 34 years.

623
00:41:51.713 --> 00:41:54.633
How could you not tell me this?

624
00:41:54.841 --> 00:41:59.221
I wanted to, honey, but it was strictly
on a «need-to-know» basis.


625
00:42:02.599 --> 00:42:05.727
So, what? He's in the CIA?
He was a spy? He is a spy?


626
00:42:05.894 --> 00:42:08.230
No, he was more like
a psychological profiler.


627
00:42:08.396 --> 00:42:11.441
They used him to interrogate suspected
double agents in the company.


628
00:42:11.608 --> 00:42:13.443
Oh, that's great. Yeah.

629
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.112
I was scared of your dad back
when I thought he was a florist.


630
00:42:16.279 --> 00:42:19.407
It's wonderful to know I've actually got
a CIA spy-hunter on my ass.


631
00:42:19.574 --> 00:42:23.411
Would you stop?
You're doing great, OK?


632
00:42:23.578 --> 00:42:26.581
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.


633
00:42:26.748 --> 00:42:30.752
– It's just weird.
– Oh, I know, but you're doing fine.


634
00:42:30.919 --> 00:42:33.797
I promise.

635
00:42:40.929 --> 00:42:42.973
– No, no!
– What's wrong, sweetie?


636
00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:46.601
I forgot. I'm not supposed
to let the snake out of my cage.


637
00:42:47.769 --> 00:42:49.104
– Your what?
– I told your dad


638
00:42:49.271 --> 00:42:50.605
I wouldn't touch you for 72 hours.

639
00:42:50.772 --> 00:42:53.775
– I'm not in junior high anymore, so…
– No, no, no.


640
00:42:53.942 --> 00:42:56.862
Seriously. I want to try
to respect his rules, OK?


641
00:42:57.028 --> 00:42:59.573
OK. Fine.

642
00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:03.785
Why don't you go ahead and get some
sleep, and I'll see you in the morning.


643
00:43:03.952 --> 00:43:05.328
OK.

644
00:43:16.923 --> 00:43:20.635
– Morning, Greg.
– Good morning.


645
00:43:20.802 --> 00:43:24.806
Pam told me she let you in
on a little secret of mine last night.


646
00:43:25.974 --> 00:43:27.684
Yes, she did.

647
00:43:28.852 --> 00:43:31.521
As long as you can keep your
mouth shut for the rest of your life,


648
00:43:31.688 --> 00:43:34.107
you're in no immediate danger.

649
00:43:35.984 --> 00:43:37.861
I won't tell.

650
00:43:39.029 --> 00:43:40.989
I'm just being humorous.

651
00:43:42.157 --> 00:43:44.034
That was funny.

652
00:43:45.785 --> 00:43:48.830
But the fact is, Greg, with
the knowledge you've been given,


653
00:43:48.997 --> 00:43:52.000
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call


654
00:43:52.167 --> 00:43:55.962
«the Byrnes family circle of trust.»

655
00:43:56.129 --> 00:43:58.923
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me,


656
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:05.013
– and round and round we go.
– OK. Understood.


657
00:44:07.891 --> 00:44:10.685
OK, good. Come on.
Let's go inside and have breakfast.


658
00:44:15.982 --> 00:44:19.653
<i>Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
Where are you</i>


659
00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:22.530
<i>I love you</i>

660
00:44:22.697 --> 00:44:26.201
Jinxy. Jinxy.

661
00:44:26.368 --> 00:44:28.536
Not at the table, honey, please.

662
00:44:28.703 --> 00:44:33.041
– Attaboy!
– Hey, hey, look who's up!


663
00:44:33.208 --> 00:44:34.709
– Hi, sweetie.
– You must be Greg.


664
00:44:34.876 --> 00:44:37.253
– Hello.
– Oh, look, somebody had


665
00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.547
a visit from the hair fairy.

666
00:44:39.714 --> 00:44:43.385
– Oh, yes.
– Nice 'do, nice 'do.


667
00:44:43.551 --> 00:44:45.720
I'll do the intros.
Greg, this is my sister, Debbie.


668
00:44:45.887 --> 00:44:48.348
– Hi. Nice to meet you.
– The bride-to-be. Congratulations.


669
00:44:48.515 --> 00:44:52.394
– And her fiance, Dr. Bob.
– You can call me Bob… M.D.


670
00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:56.272
– These are his parents, Linda Banks…
– Hi. How are you?


671
00:44:56.439 --> 00:44:59.734
…and the world-famous
plastic surgeon, Dr. Larry.


672
00:44:59.901 --> 00:45:02.070
Whoa, now, cut that out.

673
00:45:03.905 --> 00:45:05.782
You know, Greg's
in medicine, too, Larry.


674
00:45:05.949 --> 00:45:08.785
– Oh, really? What field?
– Nursing.


675
00:45:10.537 --> 00:45:13.915
– That's good.
– No, really. What field?


676
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:16.751
Nursing.

677
00:45:20.463 --> 00:45:23.258
Hey, why don't I get you
a chair, Greg?


678
00:45:23.425 --> 00:45:25.802
Thank you. Thanks.

679
00:45:25.969 --> 00:45:28.805
So, you didn't want
to go for the M.D.?


680
00:45:28.972 --> 00:45:32.934
No, I actually thought about becoming a
doctor, but I decided it wasn't for me.


681
00:45:33.101 --> 00:45:34.936
Just as well. Boards are killer.

682
00:45:35.103 --> 00:45:37.772
Actually Greg aced his MCATs.

683
00:45:37.939 --> 00:45:40.108
– You serious?
– No, I did OK.


684
00:45:40.275 --> 00:45:42.444
Oh, he did more than OK. Trust me.

685
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.572
Why did you take the test if you weren't
planning on going to med school?


686
00:45:45.739 --> 00:45:47.699
Well, I wanted to keep my options open,

687
00:45:47.907 --> 00:45:49.826
but in the end,
nursing was a better fit for me.


688
00:45:49.993 --> 00:45:52.787
It gives you the freedom to work
in several different areas of medicine.


689
00:45:52.954 --> 00:45:54.914
Plus, I can focus

690
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:57.417
as opposed to being a doctor where
you have to deal with the bureaucracy.


691
00:45:57.584 --> 00:46:00.253
Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?


692
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.255
Oh, my God!
I thought Deb told you.


693
00:46:02.422 --> 00:46:05.967
Dr. Andy threw out his back.
He can't make the wedding.


694
00:46:06.134 --> 00:46:09.179
Oh, damn. Now I have
to reconfigure the whole procession.


695
00:46:09.345 --> 00:46:14.100
Bob, why doesn't Greg stand in
for Andy, be the usher?


696
00:46:14.267 --> 00:46:17.312
– No, Pam, no.
– That'll be fine.


697
00:46:17.479 --> 00:46:19.439
Bob, Greg'll be your second usher.

698
00:46:19.606 --> 00:46:23.526
– Good.
– Yeah. Yeah, yeah, OK, sure.


699
00:46:23.693 --> 00:46:27.322
Good. Let's all finish up
and get ready to go


700
00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:29.908
because we have a pre-activity
briefing in about 32 minutes.


701
00:46:30.074 --> 00:46:31.075
Thirty-two minutes!

702
00:46:31.284 --> 00:46:34.120
You know what? In that case,
I'd better get upstairs


703
00:46:34.287 --> 00:46:36.998
and pay a little visit
to the shower fairy.


704
00:46:41.211 --> 00:46:43.171
Dina, thank you so much
for breakfast.


705
00:46:47.383 --> 00:46:50.345
– Hey, you OK?
– Why didn't you wake me up?


706
00:46:50.512 --> 00:46:52.305
I thought you'd like to sleep late.

707
00:46:52.472 --> 00:46:54.307
Not when I'm a guest
in somebody's house.


708
00:46:54.474 --> 00:46:56.768
– It's OK. Don't worry about it.
– No, it's not OK.


709
00:46:56.976 --> 00:46:59.938
Tell that to Dr. Torquemada
in there with the grand inquisition.


710
00:47:00.105 --> 00:47:02.524
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come back down.


711
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.902
– Get dressed in what?
– Borrow some more of dad's clothes.


712
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:08.571
– No, I don't… come on.
– Why not, honey?


713
00:47:08.738 --> 00:47:12.408
I just… No, I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.


714
00:47:12.575 --> 00:47:15.370
OK, well, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.


715
00:47:15.537 --> 00:47:17.372
You want me to go wake up
your brother who I never met,


716
00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:19.582
and ask if I could have
some of his clothes?


717
00:47:21.042 --> 00:47:23.044
OK, all right.

718
00:47:23.211 --> 00:47:25.880
– Where's Denny's room?
– Top of the stairs, turn right.


719
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.346
Denny?

720
00:47:37.225 --> 00:47:39.060
Denny?

721
00:47:39.978 --> 00:47:41.396
Denny?

722
00:47:43.314 --> 00:47:45.400
Hello? Hello?

723
00:47:58.955 --> 00:48:01.457
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell you doing in here?


724
00:48:01.624 --> 00:48:03.918
I'm… I'm Greg, Pam's friend.

725
00:48:04.085 --> 00:48:06.129
What? Were you just
sniffing my boxers, dude?


726
00:48:06.296 --> 00:48:10.258
No, dude, no. No, no,
she said I could come up here,


727
00:48:10.425 --> 00:48:12.385
– maybe borrow some clothes from you.
– Do me a favor. Close the door.


728
00:48:12.552 --> 00:48:14.387
– OK.
– Quick.


729
00:48:16.055 --> 00:48:19.601
– Tell anybody I wasn't here?
– No, they think you're asleep.


730
00:48:19.767 --> 00:48:23.271
– Yeah, so, it's all good.
– You scared me.


731
00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.448
Dad keeps you guys under
a pretty close watch, huh?


732
00:48:33.615 --> 00:48:35.408
No, it's not that bad.

733
00:48:35.575 --> 00:48:38.369
Your little Pamcake's got it
a lot worse than I do, you know?


734
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.080
You need some clothes.

735
00:48:41.247 --> 00:48:43.541
Yes, that would be…
That would be great.


736
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.711
– Glad to hook you up. All right?
– Cool.


737
00:48:46.878 --> 00:48:49.839
Like what you done with the crib.

738
00:48:51.716 --> 00:48:55.136
Oh, Lil' Kim. She's phat.

739
00:48:59.933 --> 00:49:01.935
P-h phat.

740
00:49:02.101 --> 00:49:04.020
I think these oughta do it.
Here you go, chief.


741
00:49:04.187 --> 00:49:06.022
– All right!
– Enjoy!


742
00:49:06.189 --> 00:49:08.149
– Thanks a lot, Denny.
– No problem.


743
00:49:08.316 --> 00:49:12.111
Oh, and don't worry about
the little covert op, all right?


744
00:49:12.278 --> 00:49:14.280
– I'll keep it on the lowdown.
– Down low.


745
00:49:14.447 --> 00:49:15.657
No doubt.

746
00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:20.828
People, people, come get
your revised itineraries.


747
00:49:20.995 --> 00:49:25.166
Larry, Linda, Debbie, Bob, honey.

748
00:49:25.333 --> 00:49:29.337
Now, I'm gonna activate the alarm.
It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds.


749
00:49:29.504 --> 00:49:31.547
– I don't think I need a jacket.
– It's cold out, honey.


750
00:49:31.714 --> 00:49:34.842
Hold on. Here, take Denny's jacket.

751
00:49:38.346 --> 00:49:41.307
– Denny, I'm lending Greg your jacket.
– Whatever.


752
00:49:41.474 --> 00:49:44.686
– Let's go.
– Hurry, hurry. We're going to be late.


753
00:49:44.852 --> 00:49:46.604
– Who is ready for the tux shop?
– Oh, fuck…


754
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:59.033
Denny, how's the tux fit?

755
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.078
– Dad…
– What's that?


756
00:50:02.245 --> 00:50:04.831
It's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.


757
00:50:08.251 --> 00:50:11.379
This isn't a sculpture, Denny.
This is a device for smoking marijuana.


758
00:50:12.547 --> 00:50:14.507
Really?

759
00:50:16.175 --> 00:50:19.554
Not mine. It's not.

760
00:50:22.557 --> 00:50:24.350
Oh, hey, Jack. 
How you doing?

761
00:50:27.186 --> 00:50:32.066
– I like the top hat. Complements you.
– Can I talk to you for a minute?


762
00:50:37.196 --> 00:50:39.073
Sit down.

763
00:50:43.244 --> 00:50:46.956
Did I not clearly explain
the circle of trust to you, Greg?


764
00:50:47.999 --> 00:50:49.834
Yeah, I think I got it.

765
00:50:50.001 --> 00:50:52.545
Then is there something
you wanna tell me?


766
00:50:52.712 --> 00:50:55.048
I… I don't think so.

767
00:50:55.214 --> 00:50:58.468
Didn't we have a discussion
yesterday in the car about this?


768
00:50:59.594 --> 00:51:01.763
Oh, yes! You mean… yes!

769
00:51:01.929 --> 00:51:04.015
You mean me and Pam. Yes,
I'd love to talk to you about that.


770
00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:06.476
We're not talking about Pam.
We're talking about you.


771
00:51:06.642 --> 00:51:10.104
See, if I can't trust you,
Greg, then I have no choice,


772
00:51:10.271 --> 00:51:12.106
but to put you right back
outside the circle.


773
00:51:12.273 --> 00:51:15.276
And once you're out, you're out.
There's no coming back.


774
00:51:16.986 --> 00:51:20.281
Well, I would definitely like
to stay inside the circle.


775
00:51:20.448 --> 00:51:22.575
Well, then, tell me the truth.

776
00:51:23.659 --> 00:51:24.660
OK.

777
00:51:29.082 --> 00:51:31.167
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.


778
00:51:32.502 --> 00:51:34.921
All right, now look, Focker,
I'm a patient man.


779
00:51:35.088 --> 00:51:38.466
That's what 19 months in a
Vietnamese prison camp will do to you.


780
00:51:38.633 --> 00:51:42.470
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move.


781
00:51:42.637 --> 00:51:46.891
And if I find that you are trying
to corrupt my firstborn child,


782
00:51:47.058 --> 00:51:48.935
I will bring you down, baby.

783
00:51:49.102 --> 00:51:51.646
I will bring you down to Chinatown.

784
00:52:06.828 --> 00:52:09.455
Where are we? I thought
we were going to Kevin's house.


785
00:52:09.622 --> 00:52:12.959
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.


786
00:52:13.126 --> 00:52:14.544
Wow!

787
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.880
– Oh, this is a crazy house.
– Not bad, huh, Dad?


788
00:52:20.049 --> 00:52:23.678
Maybe he uses marijuana for medicinal
purposes. People do that nowadays.


789
00:52:23.845 --> 00:52:26.431
This kid has been lying to us
from the moment we met him.


790
00:52:26.597 --> 00:52:28.641
Hey, you. Get in some
quality time with the boys?


791
00:52:28.808 --> 00:52:30.726
Yeah, it was fun.

792
00:52:32.019 --> 00:52:34.355
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.


793
00:52:34.522 --> 00:52:38.401
Why would «B.B.Q.
at best man's» be weird?


794
00:52:38.568 --> 00:52:41.696
Oh, my God, Greg.
I was sure I told you.


795
00:52:41.863 --> 00:52:44.574
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.


796
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.703
– Kevin, your ex-fiance?
– Hey! Welcome, everybody.


797
00:52:49.537 --> 00:52:51.038
I don't understand.
How does he know Bob?


798
00:52:55.209 --> 00:52:58.588
Well, they… they went
to lacrosse camp together,


799
00:52:58.754 --> 00:53:01.716
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.


800
00:53:01.883 --> 00:53:03.885
Lacrosse camp?

801
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.054
I was really lucky
I was able to salvage this wood


802
00:53:07.221 --> 00:53:09.432
from an old seamen's chapel
in Nantucket.


803
00:53:10.725 --> 00:53:13.728
– Wow! Kevin, the house is amazing.
– This is where the light comes in.


804
00:53:13.895 --> 00:53:15.730
Maybe you should have
gotten married here.


805
00:53:15.897 --> 00:53:18.941
All right, the sun is out,
the grill is hot and the pool is luke.


806
00:53:19.108 --> 00:53:21.194
If I can interest you
in a swim and a little B.B.Q,


807
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.446
– just follow me.
– All right, Kevo.


808
00:53:23.613 --> 00:53:25.281
– Right on schedule.
– Bring it on.


809
00:53:25.448 --> 00:53:27.450
It must cost a fortune
to heat this place.


810
00:53:27.617 --> 00:53:29.243
Wait till you see
the rest of the house.

811
00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:32.079
OK. This way, everybody, out this way.

812
00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:49.513
– You OK, sweetie?
– Yeah.


813
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.099
I'm really sorry. I don't know
why I thought you knew.


814
00:53:52.266 --> 00:53:54.101
It… It's not a big deal.

815
00:53:54.268 --> 00:53:56.771
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,


816
00:53:56.938 --> 00:54:00.441
I think I can handle an afternoon
with your ex-fiance.


817
00:54:00.608 --> 00:54:02.109
OK. Thank you.

818
00:54:02.276 --> 00:54:06.280
Now, for the floor that you're walking
on, I chose this Bolivian wormwood.


819
00:54:06.447 --> 00:54:09.867
I think it works well in here.
I have the Viking range here,


820
00:54:10.034 --> 00:54:12.954
and the twin sub-z's.
Yeah, they open up right there.


821
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.830
Oh, I get it. Like hidden.

822
00:54:14.997 --> 00:54:17.416
– Yeah, kind of blend in.
– Great.


823
00:54:18.251 --> 00:54:22.129
– Are you a homeowner, Greg?
– No, no, I rent.


824
00:54:23.297 --> 00:54:26.968
So, things are going real, real well
for you at Neuberger, aren't they, Kevo?


825
00:54:27.134 --> 00:54:29.887
Gosh, things have been going
so great lately.


826
00:54:30.054 --> 00:54:33.724
I got in early on some wireless IPOs.
The stuff just skyrocketed from there.


827
00:54:33.891 --> 00:54:34.976
Wow.

828
00:54:35.142 --> 00:54:37.311
What about you, Greg?
What line of work are you in?


829
00:54:37.478 --> 00:54:40.022
– I'm in health care.
– So you know what I'm talking about.


830
00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:42.900
There are a lot of Benjamins
to be made now with biotech stuff.


831
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:45.528
I don't have to tell you that.
How's your portfolio?


832
00:54:47.029 --> 00:54:48.114
I'd say strong…

833
00:54:49.365 --> 00:54:51.742
…to quite strong.

834
00:54:51.909 --> 00:54:53.911
You gotta strike while the iron's hot.

835
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.955
Now's the time.

836
00:54:56.122 --> 00:55:00.334
– Greg's a male nurse.
– That's right. Thank you, Jack.


837
00:55:00.501 --> 00:55:04.839
Well, that's great. That's great
to give something back like that.


838
00:55:05.006 --> 00:55:06.882
I'd love to find time to do
volunteer work.


839
00:55:07.049 --> 00:55:09.593
Just the other day I saw
this golden retriever that…


840
00:55:09.802 --> 00:55:11.721
He had like a gimp,
and he couldn't really…


841
00:55:11.887 --> 00:55:14.348
It made me feel terrible. I wish
there was something I could do.


842
00:55:14.515 --> 00:55:18.060
Yeah, well, I get paid, but also
it feels, you know, good, too.


843
00:55:18.227 --> 00:55:20.396
So it's kind of… everybody wins.

844
00:55:20.563 --> 00:55:23.190
What are you…
You're like a Wall Street trader?


845
00:55:23.357 --> 00:55:24.817
– An investment guy?
– No.


846
00:55:24.984 --> 00:55:28.738
I mean, I don't like to be painted
with that brush. Yes, that's my day job.


847
00:55:30.197 --> 00:55:32.199
We have time?
We got time, don't we, Jack?


848
00:55:32.366 --> 00:55:35.411
I want to show you what I'm really
interested in. Come on. Let's go.


849
00:55:39.874 --> 00:55:42.376
Wow! It looks like somebody
got an «A» in wood shop.


850
00:55:44.587 --> 00:55:48.382
Yeah, it's always been kind of a hobby.
I whittled that out of beech wood.


851
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:50.551
– It's beautiful.
– Yeah.


852
00:55:50.718 --> 00:55:53.346
– What got you into… «carpentering»?
– Carpentry?


853
00:55:54.597 --> 00:55:58.059
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.
He was a carpenter.


854
00:55:58.225 --> 00:56:00.895
I figured if you're gonna
follow in someone's footsteps,


855
00:56:01.062 --> 00:56:02.730
who better than Christ?

856
00:56:07.401 --> 00:56:09.278
Greg's Jewish.

857
00:56:09.737 --> 00:56:11.572
– Are you?
– Yeah.


858
00:56:13.199 --> 00:56:16.243
Well, so was J.C.
Wow. You're in good company.


859
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:18.871
Right.

860
00:56:20.915 --> 00:56:22.750
Well, I'm gonna head to the pool,

861
00:56:22.917 --> 00:56:24.919
but why don't you show
Greg and Pam the gift?


862
00:56:26.587 --> 00:56:28.547
– Wow, he made a gift.
– Greg.


863
00:56:28.714 --> 00:56:31.092
I put a fresh coat of lacquer
on this this morning,


864
00:56:31.258 --> 00:56:33.010
so bear with me with the fumes.

865
00:56:35.096 --> 00:56:38.391
Wow. Kev.

866
00:56:38.557 --> 00:56:41.060
– Isn't that something?
– That's incredible.


867
00:56:41.227 --> 00:56:43.813
– Thank you.
– Roses. Deb's favorite.


868
00:56:43.979 --> 00:56:46.690
– Yes, right.
– The little holes are for candles.


869
00:56:46.857 --> 00:56:49.110
Exactly. And then later,
they'll collect rainfall.


870
00:56:49.276 --> 00:56:52.780
– They make a tiny birdbath.
– That's great.


871
00:56:52.947 --> 00:56:55.991
It's beautiful. What is it?

872
00:56:56.158 --> 00:57:00.705
It's an altar.
Or you might call it a chuppah.


873
00:57:02.748 --> 00:57:05.251
Isn't that sweet? Wow.

874
00:57:05.418 --> 00:57:07.628
I'm gonna take it over
to the Byrneses',


875
00:57:07.795 --> 00:57:10.131
and tomorrow Robert and Debra
will meet beneath it


876
00:57:10.297 --> 00:57:14.051
to become man and wife. And later,
when they purchase a home,


877
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.137
maybe it will grace their garden.

878
00:57:16.303 --> 00:57:20.724
Well, that's my sappy, romantic idea.

879
00:57:23.352 --> 00:57:25.271
Must have taken forever to build.

880
00:57:25.438 --> 00:57:28.023
No, not too bad. 
About 70 hours.

881
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:31.986
Which isn't bad, considering I carved it
all by hand from one piece of wood.


882
00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:38.159
<i>Hey, Kevo. 12:15. Time to start
the barbecue, big guy.</i>


883
00:57:38.325 --> 00:57:41.454
OK, Mr. B.
I better get back to playing host.


884
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:45.124
OK, you guys, grab your suits,
and I'll meet you down at the pool.


885
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:47.126
I'm gonna take a pass on the swimming.

886
00:57:47.293 --> 00:57:48.627
Oh, no, you can't.

887
00:57:48.794 --> 00:57:51.380
I don't even have a suit with me.
The airline lost my bag…


888
00:57:51.547 --> 00:57:54.008
<i>Pamcake, let's go.
Mom's got your suit here.</i>


889
00:57:54.175 --> 00:57:57.178
– Coming, Dad.
– You better get going.


890
00:57:58.721 --> 00:58:01.223
Gosh, she's great.
Congratulations, man.


891
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:06.395
Thank you. And, by the way, she just
had the nicest things to say about you.


892
00:58:07.271 --> 00:58:09.273
– Really?
– Yeah.


893
00:58:11.358 --> 00:58:15.488
Gosh. Yeah, we had
some good times together.


894
00:58:15.654 --> 00:58:18.324
Boy, she is a tomcat.

895
00:58:23.704 --> 00:58:25.706
So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregger.


896
00:58:25.873 --> 00:58:28.751
– I'm not gonna swim.
– I'm not taking no for an answer.


897
00:58:28.918 --> 00:58:33.547
Cold buffet is on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.


898
00:58:33.714 --> 00:58:36.091
Comin' through here.

899
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:51.899
Yeah, that'd be Gre…
Hey, there he is! Get out here.


900
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.237
G-man, we got salmon, we got
swordfish. What's it gonna be?


901
00:58:56.403 --> 00:59:01.909
How 'bout a little of both, K-Dog?
I'm pretty hungry.


902
00:59:02.076 --> 00:59:04.745
I think they call that the munchies.

903
00:59:07.122 --> 00:59:09.375
Let's go. Hit the ball, Kev!
Show 'em what you got!


904
00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:20.678
– Come on, Greg.
– Damn!


905
00:59:20.845 --> 00:59:22.596
– He's got nothing.
– Come on, Greg.


906
00:59:22.763 --> 00:59:25.266
– Service.
– Come on, Greg.


907
00:59:29.103 --> 00:59:30.437
– Nice serve, pal.
– All right.


908
00:59:30.604 --> 00:59:31.814
Bring it on, Jack.

909
00:59:33.023 --> 00:59:37.820
– Set it!
– Oh, Greg! Come on!


910
00:59:37.987 --> 00:59:40.990
– Nice shot, Maverick!
– Sweet setup, Iceman.


911
00:59:41.156 --> 00:59:44.451
– Nice one, nurse.
– Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.


912
00:59:44.618 --> 00:59:46.787
You gotta rush the net on defense.
Don't be afraid of the ball.


913
00:59:46.954 --> 00:59:49.582
– It's Greg.
– Huddle up, team. Huddle up.


914
00:59:49.748 --> 00:59:51.959
Greg, not Glenn.
Greg is afraid of the ball.


915
00:59:52.126 --> 00:59:54.962
– Come on. This is unacceptable.
– He's gotta go for the ball.


916
00:59:55.129 --> 00:59:58.632
– Here's what we gotta do.
– Let's go! We're gettin' cold in here.


917
00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:00.175
We're gettin' creamed, people.

918
01:00:00.342 --> 01:00:02.636
If Florence Nightingale
would play defense.


919
01:00:02.803 --> 01:00:05.681
– Larry, I missed one shot.
– It was a big shot.


920
01:00:05.848 --> 01:00:09.351
Larry, keep floatin' where you are.
Denny, take the deep shots.


921
01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:12.479
Greg, nobody's expecting much out
of you. If I set you up with the ball,


922
01:00:12.646 --> 01:00:14.773
– can you jump up and spike it?
– No.


923
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.278
– I'd have to be pretty high, but yeah.
– I bet you would, Panama Red.


924
01:00:19.445 --> 01:00:21.864
– Everybody, look sharp. Break!
– Let's play some ball.


925
01:00:22.031 --> 01:00:24.617
– All right, here we go.
– Come on!


926
01:00:26.535 --> 01:00:28.287
– Let's go.
– Come on.


927
01:00:28.454 --> 01:00:32.166
– Greg!
– Set!


928
01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:35.502
You gotta spike those, Focker!
You gotta spike those!


929
01:00:35.669 --> 01:00:38.297
– Look how Bob did that. Nice play, Bob.
– Thanks, Jack.


930
01:00:38.464 --> 01:00:41.592
– Fire it up there, Focker!
– Let's do it!


931
01:00:41.759 --> 01:00:44.219
– Way to go, Deb!
– Greg!


932
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:50.351
Honey! God!

933
01:00:55.773 --> 01:00:58.359
– What the hell's the matter with you?
– It's only a game, Focker!


934
01:00:58.525 --> 01:01:00.861
Oh, honey! I'm coming!

935
01:01:01.028 --> 01:01:03.739
Get some ice.

936
01:01:03.906 --> 01:01:07.618
– My eye! Oh, my eye!
– Focker!


937
01:01:07.826 --> 01:01:10.079
God!

938
01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:15.709
– Pam, help your sister, please.
– I'm so sorry, Deb.


939
01:01:15.876 --> 01:01:19.171
Deb, you can totally see Voit
backwards on your forehead.


940
01:01:19.338 --> 01:01:21.715
– Denny, get outta here!
– You the bandleader?


941
01:01:21.882 --> 01:01:24.301
Go over the song selection
with Bob. Bob? Bob!


942
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:27.054
– Yeah, Jack.
– Are you a Mr. Focker?


943
01:01:27.221 --> 01:01:29.890
– Yes.
– OK. Sign here, please.


944
01:01:30.057 --> 01:01:32.309
– Great. Thank you.
– I'm sorry, honey.


945
01:01:41.902 --> 01:01:44.738
Hey, your suitcase. You go through it,
make sure it's all there?


946
01:01:44.905 --> 01:01:47.241
– Yeah, it's fine. What's up?
– Good.


947
01:01:49.576 --> 01:01:51.996
Wanted to make sure you're OK
since hitting the spike


948
01:01:52.162 --> 01:01:53.330
heard 'round the world.

949
01:01:53.497 --> 01:01:56.250
– Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry about that.
– It's OK.


950
01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:59.211
I don't know what got into me, Iceman.

951
01:01:59.378 --> 01:02:00.546
«Iceman»?

952
01:02:00.713 --> 01:02:03.090
I'm sorry. That a special thing
between you and Kevin?


953
01:02:03.257 --> 01:02:05.676
– Oh, Greg, stop it.
– Stop what, Iceman?


954
01:02:05.884 --> 01:02:08.470
<i>Top Gun</i> was a very popular movie
when Kevin and I dated.


955
01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:12.433
– All right? That's it.
– Iceman. I have no problem with that.


956
01:02:12.599 --> 01:02:15.936
Do you want to be Maverick?
Is that what this is all about?


957
01:02:16.103 --> 01:02:21.400
– I can't be Maverick. Kevin's Maverick.
– He used to be, but we can change that.


958
01:02:21.567 --> 01:02:25.446
– Can he be Goose?
– No, because Goose dies in the end.


959
01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:28.115
It's very sad.

960
01:02:30.159 --> 01:02:32.661
– Honey, I don't really…
– Greg, shut up.


961
01:02:32.828 --> 01:02:34.288
OK.

962
01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:49.386
– Dad, you ever think of knocking?
– Not in my own den.


963
01:02:49.553 --> 01:02:53.307
– What are you two doing in here?
– I'd say rounding second base.


964
01:02:55.976 --> 01:02:59.313
– This is Greg's room, Dad.
– We're gonna use it for storage.


965
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.608
Greg will stay in Debbie's room,
and she'll bunk up with you tonight.


966
01:03:02.775 --> 01:03:04.651
Fine. Come on, Greg.

967
01:03:04.818 --> 01:03:06.028
OK. I'll be right up.

968
01:03:06.862 --> 01:03:07.863
I'll meet you upstairs.

969
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:11.450
– Oh, good. They found your suitcase.
– Yeah.


970
01:03:11.617 --> 01:03:15.662
Hey, Jack, I don't quite know
what happened back at the tux shop.


971
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:19.374
If I've given you the wrong impression
regarding Pam in any way, I'm sorry.


972
01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:24.379
OK? I have nothing but the best
intentions with Pam, and I just…


973
01:03:24.546 --> 01:03:27.508
There's something in the suitcase here
that I'm planning on giving her


974
01:03:27.674 --> 01:03:29.802
that I think symbolizes…

975
01:03:32.304 --> 01:03:35.724
…the level of my commitment to her.

976
01:03:35.891 --> 01:03:41.396
And I wouldn't feel right asking her to
wear it without her father's permission.


977
01:03:41.855 --> 01:03:46.026
– Jack?
– Did you flush this toilet?


978
01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:50.447
Maybe. You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.


979
01:03:50.614 --> 01:03:52.574
I saw little Jinxy come in last night,

980
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:55.494
and he took a little squat
and relieved himself.


981
01:03:55.661 --> 01:03:59.289
Jinx knows not to use that toilet,
and even if he did, he'd never flush it.


982
01:03:59.456 --> 01:04:02.376
– What does it matter?
– The matter, Greg, R.N.,


983
01:04:02.543 --> 01:04:04.878
is that when this toilet
is flushed, it runs,


984
01:04:05.045 --> 01:04:08.507
and when you have a septic tank nearly
full and a toilet running all night,


985
01:04:08.674 --> 01:04:10.509
then you could have
a hell of a problem.

986
01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.719
Mr. Byrnes?

987
01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:15.514
This was not part of my job description.

988
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:17.891
Nice stench. You're really
on a roll there, bud.


989
01:04:18.058 --> 01:04:19.893
Bite me, Denny!

990
01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.354
Listen to me. In 20 hours,
I'm having a wedding here,


991
01:04:22.521 --> 01:04:24.356
so I need my cesspool pumped now!

992
01:04:24.523 --> 01:04:27.860
– Not tomorrow. Now!
– Dad, what's going on?


993
01:04:28.026 --> 01:04:31.196
– Oh, my God!
– What's that smell?


994
01:04:31.363 --> 01:04:33.407
That smell, Bob, is our shit.

995
01:04:33.574 --> 01:04:36.410
Focker flushed the toilet in the den,
so the septic tank is overflowing.


996
01:04:36.577 --> 01:04:39.162
Jack, I told you. It wasn't me.
It was Jinx.


997
01:04:39.371 --> 01:04:41.582
Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again!

998
01:04:41.748 --> 01:04:44.585
Jinx cannot flush the toilet.
He's a cat, for chrissakes!


999
01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:47.588
The animal doesn't
even have thumbs, Focker.


1000
01:04:49.256 --> 01:04:51.800
– Hey, look at this!
– Kevo!


1001
01:04:51.967 --> 01:04:54.094
Over by the tree, right?

1002
01:04:57.306 --> 01:04:59.433
No. No, no, no.
Not on the lawn!


1003
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.020
Stay where you are.
Not on the lawn!


1004
01:05:03.228 --> 01:05:05.480
– Kevin, no!
– No, no, no, no!


1005
01:05:10.944 --> 01:05:14.656
– No, no, no!
– What the heck?


1006
01:05:31.924 --> 01:05:34.343
I know that's what I said I wanted,
that's what I wanted.


1007
01:05:34.509 --> 01:05:36.386
It is a black Samsonite suitcase.

1008
01:05:36.595 --> 01:05:38.472
What I'm saying is,
do you think it's possible


1009
01:05:38.639 --> 01:05:40.933
that the Samsonite people,
in some crazy little scheme


1010
01:05:41.099 --> 01:05:43.977
to actually turn a profit,
made more than one?


1011
01:05:44.144 --> 01:05:45.896
<i>– I don't think so.</i>
– Really, you don't?


1012
01:05:46.104 --> 01:05:48.440
<i>I am going to need your
baggage claim number again.</i>


1013
01:05:48.607 --> 01:05:49.608
Jinx, stop.

1014
01:06:37.948 --> 01:06:41.159
– I know I signed for it.
<i>– I'm looking at your signature.</i>


1015
01:06:41.326 --> 01:06:43.453
Do me a favor.
Could I talk to your supervisor?


1016
01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.706
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1017
01:06:45.872 --> 01:06:47.082
– What's your name?
<i>– Joy.</i>


1018
01:06:47.249 --> 01:06:50.877
– Let me talk to your supervisor.
<i>– My supervisor is on a break.</i>


1019
01:06:51.044 --> 01:06:53.547
When he gets back, have him
give me a call right away.


1020
01:06:53.714 --> 01:06:55.549
– It's a very important bag.
<i>– I'm sure it is, sir.</i>


1021
01:07:00.804 --> 01:07:03.557
Jinx.

1022
01:07:03.724 --> 01:07:06.685
Don't ask me what it's for.
I need you to do this thing.


1023
01:07:06.852 --> 01:07:09.521
Please, I'm in a time situation here,
so just do it. I'll hold on.


1024
01:07:09.688 --> 01:07:11.606
<i>– So the name's «Greg Focker»?</i>
– I don't know.


1025
01:07:11.773 --> 01:07:13.400
Greg or Gregory. 
Run both names.

1026
01:07:15.027 --> 01:07:16.778
Jinx.

1027
01:07:16.945 --> 01:07:18.405
Come on. No. Jinx.

1028
01:07:18.572 --> 01:07:19.906
Come here. Jinxy.

1029
01:07:20.073 --> 01:07:23.243
Mew, mew, mew. No. No.

1030
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:25.746
Jinx. Oh, shit.

1031
01:07:25.912 --> 01:07:28.415
Greg didn't ace his med school boards.

1032
01:07:28.582 --> 01:07:30.125
He never even took
the goddamn MCATs.


1033
01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:34.254
Oh, Jack, that's what you
had your sources check out?


1034
01:07:34.421 --> 01:07:36.923
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?


1035
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:39.468
I bet he doesn't even have
a real nursing degree.


1036
01:07:39.634 --> 01:07:41.970
A lot of these hospital workers
are pill poppers


1037
01:07:42.137 --> 01:07:43.889
looking for easy access to ludes.

1038
01:07:44.056 --> 01:07:46.725
We already know that he's been
puffin' the magic dragon.


1039
01:07:46.892 --> 01:07:49.144
I knew the little quack was lying.

1040
01:07:50.604 --> 01:07:54.274
Jinxy. Come here.
Come here, little Jinxy head.


1041
01:08:00.322 --> 01:08:04.117
<i>Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
I won't hurt you</i>


1042
01:08:08.955 --> 01:08:12.709
– The fact is, Greg lied to you.
– He did not lie to me, Dad.


1043
01:08:12.918 --> 01:08:14.795
He lied to you, and I thought
you should know the truth.


1044
01:08:14.961 --> 01:08:17.172
I love you too much
to see you get hurt.


1045
01:08:17.339 --> 01:08:19.800
I don't care what
your information says, Dad.


1046
01:08:19.966 --> 01:08:22.386
Greg took the MCATs. OK?

1047
01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.367
Holy…

1048
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:30.245
Shit!

1049
01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:47.429
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1050
01:09:52.726 --> 01:09:53.894
No!

1051
01:10:01.902 --> 01:10:03.862
Holy…

1052
01:10:04.029 --> 01:10:06.406
– No!
– Oh, my God!


1053
01:10:06.573 --> 01:10:08.575
All right, everybody.
All right, stand back.


1054
01:10:08.742 --> 01:10:10.994
Stay back. Stay back.

1055
01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:15.248
– Watch out. Watch out!
– Oh, Jack! Oh, God!


1056
01:10:18.084 --> 01:10:22.088
We've got a fire! Somebody call 911
right away! Hurry up!


1057
01:10:27.093 --> 01:10:29.846
Jinxy! Jinxy!

1058
01:10:30.013 --> 01:10:33.266
We've checked every yard, every car
on the street. Nobody's seen him.


1059
01:10:33.433 --> 01:10:35.352
He's not up in any
of the trees, Jack.


1060
01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.437
We checked all the bedrooms.
Jinx isn't up here.


1061
01:10:37.604 --> 01:10:40.023
Yeah, none of the neighbors
have seen him either.


1062
01:10:40.232 --> 01:10:43.318
You tried to milk him, didn't you,
you sick son of a bitch!


1063
01:10:43.485 --> 01:10:45.445
Dad, stop it. That's enough.

1064
01:10:45.612 --> 01:10:48.198
– Honey, please calm down.
– How can I calm down


1065
01:10:48.365 --> 01:10:50.200
if we're 15 minutes away
from the wedding rehearsal


1066
01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:51.409
and the ring bearer's missing?

1067
01:10:51.576 --> 01:10:54.579
– What do you mean, «the ring bearer»?
– Your daddy didn't tell you?


1068
01:10:54.746 --> 01:10:57.791
He taught Jinx to walk down
the aisle with this little pillow.


1069
01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.834
Oh, no. No, you didn't, Dad.

1070
01:11:00.001 --> 01:11:01.628
Yeah, yeah. You put
this around the neck,


1071
01:11:01.795 --> 01:11:03.338
and these ribbons are for the rings.

1072
01:11:03.505 --> 01:11:06.633
– That's adorable, Jack.
– Oh, for chrissakes!


1073
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.926
That's great, Dad.

1074
01:11:08.093 --> 01:11:09.678
Yeah, but now we have
to postpone the rehearsal.


1075
01:11:09.844 --> 01:11:12.597
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, you come with your car.


1076
01:11:12.764 --> 01:11:14.975
We're gonna canvass the neighborhood.
Dee, ask O'Boyle to wait.


1077
01:11:15.141 --> 01:11:18.144
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule for the morning.


1078
01:11:18.311 --> 01:11:19.312
– Jack!
– No!


1079
01:11:19.479 --> 01:11:22.023
We cannot cancel the rehearsal
for some stupid cat!


1080
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:26.319
Stupid cat? How could you say that?
That cat's been like a brother to you!


1081
01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:30.824
We're supposed to let him wander the
streets without food, water or toilet?


1082
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:35.120
– Dad, Greg'll find him.
– What?


1083
01:11:35.287 --> 01:11:38.123
– Yeah, what?
– Oh, that's wonderful.


1084
01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:43.586
Fine. Fine. OK. Denny?

1085
01:11:43.795 --> 01:11:45.880
– Denny? Denny? Denny!
– Dad, I'm right here.


1086
01:11:46.047 --> 01:11:48.925
OK. You're gonna fill in
as the ring bearer for now.


1087
01:11:49.092 --> 01:11:51.636
I'm not wearin' that stupid
pillow thing on my head.


1088
01:11:51.803 --> 01:11:54.055
Oh, yes, you damn well will!

1089
01:11:55.557 --> 01:12:00.478
Jinx! Jinx! Here, Jinx.

1090
01:12:00.645 --> 01:12:05.692
You just go and wander the streets
without food, water or toilet? Fucker!


1091
01:12:08.403 --> 01:12:10.280
Actually, you may be in luck.

1092
01:12:10.488 --> 01:12:13.366
They brought in a Himalayan
a little while ago.


1093
01:12:14.659 --> 01:12:15.660
There he is.

1094
01:12:16.953 --> 01:12:18.788
Holy shit, that's Jinx.

1095
01:12:18.955 --> 01:12:21.916
– Jinxy!
– No, let me see that photo again.


1096
01:12:22.083 --> 01:12:24.336
You gotta picture him
without that stupid Santa cap.


1097
01:12:24.502 --> 01:12:28.381
– Come on, Jinxy. Jinxy!
– No.


1098
01:12:28.548 --> 01:12:32.302
You see, in the picture,
your cat has an all-black tail.


1099
01:12:32.469 --> 01:12:35.388
– Yeah.
– And this one has a white tip.


1100
01:12:35.555 --> 01:12:37.974
No, I'm sorry about that, chief.

1101
01:12:40.101 --> 01:12:42.395
– Looks just like him.
– Almost.


1102
01:12:43.563 --> 01:12:45.774
Except for that tail.

1103
01:12:57.243 --> 01:12:58.370
Dearly beloved…

1104
01:13:01.247 --> 01:13:06.920
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here on this beautiful day


1105
01:13:07.087 --> 01:13:09.255
to join Dr. Robert Banks…

1106
01:13:12.467 --> 01:13:17.472
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here on this beautiful day


1107
01:13:17.639 --> 01:13:22.268
to join Dr. Robert Banks and
Debra Byrnes in holy matrimony.


1108
01:13:22.435 --> 01:13:24.771
This is a special day…

1109
01:13:49.254 --> 01:13:51.297
He found him!

1110
01:13:51.464 --> 01:13:54.134
It's him! It's him!

1111
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.137
I gotta see this.

1112
01:13:59.305 --> 01:14:02.517
– Look, Dad, it's Jinx.
– Oh, my little baby!


1113
01:14:02.684 --> 01:14:06.938
– We found you. We found you.
– Greg, thank you so much.


1114
01:14:07.105 --> 01:14:10.024
– Where did you find him?
– Gave us a little scare, huh?


1115
01:14:11.151 --> 01:14:12.944
Jinxy.

1116
01:14:28.626 --> 01:14:31.671
To Greg.

1117
01:14:31.838 --> 01:14:34.883
– Honey, where is Greg, anyway?
– He's in the restroom.


1118
01:14:35.049 --> 01:14:38.887
Yes, I tried there. I've tried
every shelter on the north shore, OK?


1119
01:14:39.053 --> 01:14:43.641
He's a brown-and-black Himalayan
with an all-black tail.


1120
01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:48.646
Mr. Jinx. Yeah, OK.
You go check. I'll call you back.


1121
01:14:50.565 --> 01:14:54.027
– Hey, hey! It's the man of the hour.
– Hey!


1122
01:14:54.194 --> 01:14:57.071
Sorry, folks. Had to pay
a little visit to the urinal fairy.


1123
01:15:02.577 --> 01:15:05.663
Greg, nice work with the cat today.

1124
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:08.541
Thanks, Jack.
I'm just glad I could help out.


1125
01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:11.544
We never did get to finish
that little «convo» back in the den.


1126
01:15:11.711 --> 01:15:14.839
When you have a minute, there is still
something I'd love to talk to you about.


1127
01:15:15.006 --> 01:15:18.092
We'll get right to it as soon
as we get back. You have my word.


1128
01:15:18.259 --> 01:15:20.762
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of trust.


1129
01:15:20.929 --> 01:15:23.932
Guess who's back in the circle of trust.

1130
01:15:49.457 --> 01:15:51.918
Look at Jack!

1131
01:15:53.461 --> 01:15:56.548
Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely.

1132
01:15:56.714 --> 01:15:59.926
Maybe I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?


1133
01:16:00.093 --> 01:16:04.097
Sure. I bet he could whittle a private
little dance floor for the two of you.


1134
01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:06.224
I'm serious.

1135
01:16:06.391 --> 01:16:08.977
I saw some beech wood outside.
He's very handy.


1136
01:16:09.143 --> 01:16:13.606
He's an extremely handy
and crafty craftsman.


1137
01:16:13.773 --> 01:16:15.650
I shouldn't paint him
with that brush, but…


1138
01:16:15.817 --> 01:16:18.319
Come on. Seriously. Seriously.

1139
01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:20.613
Part of you wishes
you ended up with him.


1140
01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.785
Yes, he's very talented,
but it would've never worked out.


1141
01:16:25.952 --> 01:16:27.787
Why not?

1142
01:16:27.954 --> 01:16:30.790
I was never in love with Kevin.

1143
01:16:34.961 --> 01:16:36.462
I'm in love with you.

1144
01:16:38.506 --> 01:16:40.633
– That's a good explanation.
– Think so?


1145
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.427
Thought you'd like that.

1146
01:16:42.594 --> 01:16:44.804
– I do.
– I'm glad.


1147
01:16:46.472 --> 01:16:50.977
No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.
I called you like half an hour ago.


1148
01:16:51.144 --> 01:16:55.857
OK, I already…
I already described it. Airline.


1149
01:16:56.024 --> 01:16:57.984
Messages.

1150
01:16:58.151 --> 01:17:01.946
It's, it's brown…

1151
01:17:03.656 --> 01:17:06.826
…with a little bit of black trim.

1152
01:17:06.993 --> 01:17:08.995
Yes.

1153
01:17:09.162 --> 01:17:11.080
<i>Please enter your four-digit code.</i>

1154
01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:16.669
<i>Jack, hi. It's Hank Macatee
from next door.</i>


1155
01:17:16.836 --> 01:17:20.131
<i>You'll never guess who wandered
over here this afternoon. Mr. Jinx.</i>


1156
01:17:20.298 --> 01:17:23.384
<i>Yeah, he's not wearing his collar,
but I'm sure it's Jinxy.</i>


1157
01:17:23.551 --> 01:17:25.720
<i>Thought you might be worried,
so just give me a jingle</i>


1158
01:17:25.887 --> 01:17:28.640
<i>when you guys get home, and
I'll bring the little rascal over.</i>


1159
01:17:28.806 --> 01:17:31.184
OK, well, if you could
just keep checking, please,


1160
01:17:31.351 --> 01:17:33.394
and I'll call you back later. Thanks.

1161
01:17:34.938 --> 01:17:38.358
– Any luck?
– No, they're still looking.


1162
01:17:38.524 --> 01:17:40.401
Hey, Jack, this is a great party.

1163
01:17:40.568 --> 01:17:44.906
I guess sometimes these things come
together in their own kooky sort of way.


1164
01:17:45.073 --> 01:17:48.034
Yeah, it's kind of like
the way you found Jinxy.


1165
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:51.913
– You found him at that animal shelter?
– Yeah, right.


1166
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.583
– The important thing is he's home now.
– Yes.


1167
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:58.378
Yeah. You know, there's something
about that ball of fur


1168
01:17:58.544 --> 01:18:00.588
that just puts a
big smile on my face.

1169
01:18:00.755 --> 01:18:04.217
Yeah. You haven't seen any
of his latest tricks, have you?


1170
01:18:04.384 --> 01:18:06.386
No.

1171
01:18:06.552 --> 01:18:08.429
Well, when we get back, 
I'll show you.

1172
01:18:08.596 --> 01:18:11.849
We don't have to do it tonight. He's had
a long day. He's probably tired.


1173
01:18:12.016 --> 01:18:14.852
– I wouldn't want to…
– I think he'd like to show you tonight.


1174
01:18:18.272 --> 01:18:20.692
Why don't you give me
the key and let me drive?


1175
01:18:20.858 --> 01:18:22.694
Hey, Larry. You know what?
Why don't I drive?


1176
01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.696
– It's a very expensive car.
– Good idea.


1177
01:18:24.862 --> 01:18:26.781
I've always wanted to test-drive a Benz.

1178
01:18:26.948 --> 01:18:28.950
Be my guest, Focker.

1179
01:18:30.076 --> 01:18:33.955
– Hey, sweetie, what are you doing?
– Larry said I could drive.


1180
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:41.212
– Let's go. Hurry, hurry. All right.
– Bye, guys.


1181
01:18:41.379 --> 01:18:43.089
– See you.
– Thanks for driving.


1182
01:18:46.884 --> 01:18:50.805
– Drives better than your Taurus, Greg?
– Yeah.


1183
01:18:50.972 --> 01:18:53.433
Come on. Get in the car, honey.
Let's go. Hurry up.


1184
01:18:53.599 --> 01:18:55.643
OK, OK.

1185
01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.604
Whoa, nellie!

1186
01:18:58.771 --> 01:19:01.566
Everybody comfortable back there?

1187
01:19:03.609 --> 01:19:06.571
You're a real wild man
at that wheel there.


1188
01:19:08.948 --> 01:19:11.659
You got your seat belts on back there?
Get your seat belts on.


1189
01:19:16.789 --> 01:19:18.791
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

1190
01:19:21.627 --> 01:19:23.671
– You're driving like a maniac!
– Focker, take it easy!


1191
01:19:23.838 --> 01:19:27.133
– Benz drives like a dream, Lar.
– Let's not make it a nightmare, huh?


1192
01:19:30.303 --> 01:19:32.305
Oh, there's Jack.

1193
01:19:34.432 --> 01:19:37.268
Hey, Jackie.

1194
01:19:42.273 --> 01:19:44.984
You wanna play, pops? Let's play.

1195
01:19:48.488 --> 01:19:50.364
OK, now, Greg? Greg?

1196
01:19:50.531 --> 01:19:53.868
Greg, no!

1197
01:19:59.123 --> 01:20:02.835
– Is everything OK, honey?
– Yeah, just trying to make good time.


1198
01:20:04.295 --> 01:20:06.172
What the heck is the matter with you?

1199
01:20:06.339 --> 01:20:08.674
All right. We're gonna be home.
We're gonna get home.


1200
01:20:08.841 --> 01:20:10.468
Very soon, we're gonna get home.

1201
01:20:15.723 --> 01:20:18.226
It's not the Autobahn.
Come on, Greg!


1202
01:20:22.897 --> 01:20:23.898
Jesus!

1203
01:20:24.065 --> 01:20:27.318
– Maybe you should drive after all.
– We're OK.


1204
01:20:33.616 --> 01:20:35.034
All right.

1205
01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:44.377
Oh, no. No, please.

1206
01:20:46.712 --> 01:20:48.631
– Yes!
– Jack just turned.


1207
01:20:48.798 --> 01:20:53.511
You were supposed to make
that left at the light, Focker.


1208
01:20:54.262 --> 01:20:56.305
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1209
01:20:56.472 --> 01:20:58.975
Where does he think he's going?

1210
01:20:59.141 --> 01:21:02.937
– Home, home, home.
– What a wild ride.


1211
01:21:03.104 --> 01:21:05.565
Who gave him the keys?

1212
01:21:05.731 --> 01:21:08.776
– OK, we're out.
– I'm gonna get out on your side, honey.


1213
01:21:08.943 --> 01:21:11.946
– I wonder if he has a license.
– Yeah, a license to kill.


1214
01:21:16.075 --> 01:21:18.578
Come on, everybody.

1215
01:21:18.744 --> 01:21:21.747
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

1216
01:21:21.914 --> 01:21:24.375
You're a lunatic!

1217
01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:26.419
Come on, Linda!

1218
01:21:26.586 --> 01:21:28.045
Hey, hey!

1219
01:21:36.095 --> 01:21:38.931
– What in the world…
– Oh, my…


1220
01:21:39.098 --> 01:21:41.267
Oh, the dress!

1221
01:21:41.434 --> 01:21:43.769
It was the cat! Goddamn you!

1222
01:21:43.936 --> 01:21:45.897
– Dad, Dad… Dad! Dad!
– Jinx, I'm gonna…


1223
01:21:46.063 --> 01:21:47.815
Calm down!

1224
01:21:47.982 --> 01:21:51.611
– Where's the cat?
– Cat got out! Cat got out, Jack!


1225
01:22:00.077 --> 01:22:04.248
You spray-painted his tail to make him
look like Jinxy, didn't you, Focker?


1226
01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:07.126
Greg, what's he talking about?

1227
01:22:07.293 --> 01:22:11.464
Hank Macatee called me a couple of
hours ago and told me he found Jinxy.


1228
01:22:11.631 --> 01:22:13.424
He took his collar
and put it on an impostor.


1229
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:17.303
He spray-painted his tail, then
tried to beat us back here so that


1230
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:20.598
– he could get rid of the evidence.
– Oh, no.


1231
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:25.937
Please tell me that's not true, Greg.

1232
01:22:27.605 --> 01:22:31.150
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find the real Jinx.


1233
01:22:33.819 --> 01:22:36.447
How could you do something like that?

1234
01:22:37.531 --> 01:22:39.951
– I'm sorry.
– What are you going to tell me next?


1235
01:22:40.117 --> 01:22:42.620
That you set Kevin's altar on fire?

1236
01:22:44.914 --> 01:22:46.916
Oh, my God.

1237
01:22:49.168 --> 01:22:52.672
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was chasing Jinx up onto the roof.


1238
01:22:52.838 --> 01:22:56.008
I had a smoke, and I think
I might have lit something that…


1239
01:22:57.843 --> 01:23:02.139
I don't know what happened. He put
so much goddamn lacquer on that thing.


1240
01:23:02.306 --> 01:23:07.561
– It was an accident waiting to happen.
– This is very disappointing, Greg.


1241
01:23:11.315 --> 01:23:14.235
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.


1242
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.239
So you lied to me
about everything, Greg?


1243
01:23:18.406 --> 01:23:21.033
You lied about the cat,
the fire, about the MCATs.


1244
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.370
I didn't lie about the MCATs.
Don't you see what's happening here?


1245
01:23:24.537 --> 01:23:27.873
– Your dad has turned you against me.
– I didn't turn her against you.


1246
01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.542
You did that to yourself.

1247
01:23:31.544 --> 01:23:35.047
Jack, please. You didn't like me
from the second I walked in here.


1248
01:23:35.214 --> 01:23:38.050
I'm a very accepting person, Focker.

1249
01:23:38.217 --> 01:23:41.887
– All I ask for is honesty.
– Oh, honesty?


1250
01:23:43.222 --> 01:23:45.725
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty, Jack?


1251
01:23:45.891 --> 01:23:47.560
OK, let's talk
a little truth and honesty.


1252
01:23:47.727 --> 01:23:52.690
Let's talk a little
«Operation Ko Samui,» Jack.


1253
01:23:52.857 --> 01:23:54.734
What's he talking about, Dad?

1254
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.236
Yeah, that's weird, 'cause
I thought there weren't any secrets


1255
01:23:57.403 --> 01:23:59.488
inside the circle of trust, Jack.

1256
01:23:59.655 --> 01:24:01.574
I don't know what you're talking about.

1257
01:24:01.741 --> 01:24:05.077
You don't? What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?


1258
01:24:05.244 --> 01:24:07.872
Hey, Pam, guess what. 
Daddy's planning

1259
01:24:08.039 --> 01:24:11.250
a little covert operation in Thailand
for the day after the wedding.


1260
01:24:11.417 --> 01:24:13.753
You are?

1261
01:24:13.919 --> 01:24:15.880
Round and round we go, Jack. Hey.

1262
01:24:16.047 --> 01:24:17.923
I bet everybody would love
to hear about your rendezvous


1263
01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:19.884
in the parking lot of
the Oyster Bay Drug and Sundrie.


1264
01:24:20.051 --> 01:24:22.928
You know what I'm talking about.
Where the guy gave you the passports


1265
01:24:23.095 --> 01:24:26.599
and the documents. Or how about
your little phone call in Thai?


1266
01:24:27.099 --> 01:24:29.101
– Jack can't talk Thai.
– Oh, no, Dina.


1267
01:24:29.268 --> 01:24:33.314
Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talk Thai very well.


1268
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.442
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.


1269
01:24:36.609 --> 01:24:39.862
He's still very much in the CIA.

1270
01:24:40.946 --> 01:24:44.116
– Daddy. What…
– He's right.


1271
01:24:44.283 --> 01:24:47.953
He's right. My cover's blown.

1272
01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.458
I am planning a secret operation
the day after the wedding.


1273
01:24:52.625 --> 01:24:54.126
What?

1274
01:24:54.293 --> 01:24:56.962
A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob.

1275
01:24:57.129 --> 01:25:00.007
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!


1276
01:25:00.758 --> 01:25:01.759
What?

1277
01:25:01.926 --> 01:25:04.637
Ko Samui is an island
off the coast of Thailand!


1278
01:25:04.804 --> 01:25:08.349
That guy I was meeting in the parking
lot is Thor Svenson, my travel agent.


1279
01:25:08.516 --> 01:25:10.476
He was giving me their visas.

1280
01:25:13.145 --> 01:25:16.398
Wow, Thailand. Thanks a lot, J.B.
That's something.


1281
01:25:16.565 --> 01:25:18.692
Don't mention it. I just…

1282
01:25:19.652 --> 01:25:21.737
You know, if this nursing thing
doesn't work out, Focker,


1283
01:25:21.904 --> 01:25:24.323
I'd say you definitely have
a career in espionage.


1284
01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:29.787
Thanks, Greg.

1285
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.698
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go to the airport now.


1286
01:26:11.245 --> 01:26:13.330
I guess you're gonna stay here.

1287
01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:19.003
Pam, I…

1288
01:26:51.035 --> 01:26:54.079
– Gaylord M. Focker?
– Gaylord? Gaylord?


1289
01:26:54.246 --> 01:26:56.248
Yeah, that's me.

1290
01:26:57.291 --> 01:26:59.752
– I thought your name was Greg.
– It is.


1291
01:26:59.919 --> 01:27:01.921
– That's not what it says on the form.
– I know.


1292
01:27:02.087 --> 01:27:04.757
It's my legal name. Nobody's called me
by it since third grade.


1293
01:27:07.927 --> 01:27:09.136
Whatever.

1294
01:27:11.263 --> 01:27:14.099
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So your name's Gay Focker?


1295
01:27:20.147 --> 01:27:22.024
– Denny.
– I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just…


1296
01:27:22.191 --> 01:27:23.609
It's not a normal name.

1297
01:27:24.777 --> 01:27:27.655
– Come on. Now look what you've done.
– Oh, Pammy.


1298
01:27:27.821 --> 01:27:30.074
Don't… Don't go away.

1299
01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:06.944
You're in luck. 
There is room.

1300
01:28:14.201 --> 01:28:19.665
And without a Saturday stay-over,
that fare difference will be $1,137.11.


1301
01:28:23.335 --> 01:28:26.839
– Did you want me to book you the seat?
– OK. All right.


1302
01:28:28.007 --> 01:28:30.050
Did you want to check any bags today?

1303
01:29:12.384 --> 01:29:15.137
We should be all right with
only one usher, don't you think?


1304
01:29:16.555 --> 01:29:18.766
I'm not so sure, Jack.

1305
01:29:24.897 --> 01:29:26.899
Thought you might like to see this.

1306
01:29:35.616 --> 01:29:38.744
– How did you get this?
– Oh, I have my sources, too.


1307
01:29:43.165 --> 01:29:47.252
I called Gaylord, aka
Greg's parents in Detroit.


1308
01:29:47.419 --> 01:29:50.631
They saved his SAT scores too,
in case you're interested.


1309
01:29:50.798 --> 01:29:54.635
Oh, honey. It… That doesn't matter
if he did well on some test.


1310
01:29:54.802 --> 01:29:56.804
What does that prove?
Look at this place!


1311
01:29:56.970 --> 01:29:59.765
He almost destroyed the wedding
because he lied!


1312
01:30:01.725 --> 01:30:06.689
I love you, Daddy, but you
can be a real jerk sometimes.


1313
01:30:09.942 --> 01:30:14.154
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough for Pam.


1314
01:30:14.321 --> 01:30:16.615
Who is, Jack?

1315
01:30:16.782 --> 01:30:20.119
Nobody has ever been
good enough for your Pam.


1316
01:30:24.957 --> 01:30:28.085
I mean, do you realize that you
never even warmed up to Kevin


1317
01:30:28.252 --> 01:30:30.212
until she broke up with him?

1318
01:30:30.379 --> 01:30:34.091
Maybe it's time you think about
what Pam wants.


1319
01:30:49.022 --> 01:30:50.315
Greg, it's me.

1320
01:30:51.483 --> 01:30:53.485
I'm sure you're in the air by now,

1321
01:30:53.652 --> 01:30:57.197
so I guess you'll just
get this when you get home.


1322
01:30:59.992 --> 01:31:02.828
Listen, I am so sorry.

1323
01:31:02.995 --> 01:31:07.791
I acted like a complete idiot,
and I hope that you can forgive me.


1324
01:31:09.168 --> 01:31:13.672
I mean, I don't care about
the fire or the cat or…


1325
01:31:15.048 --> 01:31:19.678
I mean, I can't believe you
actually spray-painted a cat.


1326
01:31:19.845 --> 01:31:23.974
That's actually really gross,
but the point is that…


1327
01:31:25.559 --> 01:31:28.520
…that I understand
why you did it, and…


1328
01:31:28.687 --> 01:31:32.191
…and I love you. I want you
to know that I really…


1329
01:31:32.357 --> 01:31:34.526
I really, really love you, and…

1330
01:31:37.696 --> 01:31:42.868
When you get this,
will you please call me? OK. Bye.


1331
01:31:49.124 --> 01:31:51.418
Marty, listen, I need
a commercial flight ID scan.


1332
01:31:51.585 --> 01:31:53.795
Interstate from New York
La Guardia to Chicago.


1333
01:31:53.962 --> 01:31:56.173
Four-hour sweeps,
backwards and forwards.


1334
01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:59.885
Last name: Foxtrot, Oscar,
Charlie, Kilo, Echo, Romeo.


1335
01:32:00.052 --> 01:32:02.554
First name: Golf,
Alpha, Yankee, Lima…


1336
01:32:02.721 --> 01:32:07.434
<i>Gaylord Focker on Atlantic American
flight 27, departs 2:35.</i>


1337
01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:10.395
– 2:35? Twenty-three minutes. Thanks.
<i>– Affirmative.</i>


1338
01:32:11.063 --> 01:32:13.690
– Enjoy your flight.
– Thanks.


1339
01:32:13.857 --> 01:32:15.400
Hello.

1340
01:32:17.903 --> 01:32:20.739
I'm sorry. We're only boarding
rows nine and above right now.


1341
01:32:20.906 --> 01:32:24.660
– You'll have to wait.
– Well, I'm in row eight.


1342
01:32:24.827 --> 01:32:26.870
Please step aside, sir.

1343
01:32:27.037 --> 01:32:29.039
It's just one row.
Don't you think it's OK if I…


1344
01:32:29.206 --> 01:32:31.041
We'll call your row momentarily.

1345
01:32:33.126 --> 01:32:35.254
Step aside, sir.

1346
01:32:59.945 --> 01:33:03.156
Thank you for waiting. We'd like to
continue boarding the aircraft now.


1347
01:33:03.323 --> 01:33:06.285
We're now boarding all rows, please.
All remaining rows.


1348
01:33:13.792 --> 01:33:15.168
Hello.

1349
01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:19.840
Enjoy your flight.

1350
01:33:35.814 --> 01:33:37.816
Excuse me.

1351
01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.320
OK, where's the fire, huh?

1352
01:33:46.283 --> 01:33:48.702
Will you hand me
a pillow over there?


1353
01:33:48.869 --> 01:33:51.496
– You're gonna have to check that.
– I got it.


1354
01:33:51.663 --> 01:33:54.291
– No, I'm sorry. That bag won't fit.
– No, I'm not… hey.


1355
01:33:54.458 --> 01:33:57.169
– I'm not checking my bag, OK?
– There's no need to raise your voice.


1356
01:33:57.336 --> 01:34:00.714
I'm not raising my voice. This would be
raising my voice to you, OK?


1357
01:34:00.881 --> 01:34:02.299
I don't want to check my bag.

1358
01:34:02.466 --> 01:34:05.677
By the way, your airline,
you suck at checking bags.


1359
01:34:05.844 --> 01:34:07.721
Because I already did that once,
and you lost it,


1360
01:34:07.888 --> 01:34:10.015
and then I had everything
screwed up very badly for me.


1361
01:34:10.182 --> 01:34:12.184
– OK?
– I can assure you that your bag


1362
01:34:12.351 --> 01:34:14.186
will be placed safely below deck
with the other luggage.


1363
01:34:14.353 --> 01:34:17.898
Oh, yeah? How do you know my bag will
be safe below with the other luggage?


1364
01:34:18.065 --> 01:34:20.567
Are you physically gonna
take my bag beneath the plane?


1365
01:34:20.734 --> 01:34:23.278
Gonna go with the guys with
the earmuffs and put it in there?


1366
01:34:23.445 --> 01:34:26.490
– No.
– No? OK. Then shut your pie hole


1367
01:34:26.657 --> 01:34:29.576
and listen to me when I say
that I am finished


1368
01:34:29.743 --> 01:34:33.080
with the checking-of-the-bags
conversation!


1369
01:34:33.246 --> 01:34:36.917
Sir, we have a policy on this airline
that if a bag is this large, we…


1370
01:34:37.084 --> 01:34:39.670
Get your grubby little paws
off of my bag, OK?


1371
01:34:39.836 --> 01:34:42.964
Not like I have a bomb in here, it's
not like I want to blow up the plane.


1372
01:34:43.173 --> 01:34:46.385
I wanna stow my bag according
to your safety regulations.


1373
01:34:46.551 --> 01:34:48.595
– Sir, sir…
– If you would take a second


1374
01:34:48.762 --> 01:34:51.765
and take the little sticks out
of your head and clean out your ears,


1375
01:34:51.932 --> 01:34:53.850
maybe you would see that
I'm a person who has feelings,


1376
01:34:54.017 --> 01:34:55.936
and all I have to do
is do what I wanna do!


1377
01:34:56.103 --> 01:34:58.981
All I wanna do is hold onto my bag
and not listen to you!


1378
01:34:59.147 --> 01:35:01.274
The only way that I would
ever let go of my bag


1379
01:35:01.441 --> 01:35:02.943
would be if you came over here now

1380
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:05.278
and tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers.


1381
01:35:05.445 --> 01:35:09.408
OK? If you can get it from my kung fu
grip, then you can come and have it.


1382
01:35:09.574 --> 01:35:11.952
OK? Otherwise, step off, bitch.

1383
01:35:14.079 --> 01:35:16.832
Get off of me! 
Get off of me!

1384
01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.543
– You got him?
– Yeah.


1385
01:35:26.258 --> 01:35:28.468
Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended.


1386
01:35:28.635 --> 01:35:30.429
So tow it.

1387
01:35:30.595 --> 01:35:32.931
I've got a plane full of people saying
you threatened that stewardess.


1388
01:35:33.098 --> 01:35:34.391
I was not threatening her.

1389
01:35:34.558 --> 01:35:36.810
I was trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing.


1390
01:35:36.977 --> 01:35:39.479
You were acting like a maniac,
and you threatened her with a bomb!


1391
01:35:39.646 --> 01:35:41.732
– I said I didn't have a bomb!
– You said «bomb.»


1392
01:35:41.898 --> 01:35:44.651
– I said, «It's not like I have a bomb.»
– You said «bomb» on an airplane.


1393
01:35:44.818 --> 01:35:48.113
– What's wrong with saying «bomb»?
– You can't say «bomb» on an airplane.


1394
01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.284
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
bomb, bomb! You gonna arrest me?


1395
01:35:52.451 --> 01:35:55.287
– You assaulted an airline employee…
– What if I was a bombardier?


1396
01:35:55.454 --> 01:35:57.330
I got enough to put you away
for a few years!


1397
01:35:58.623 --> 01:36:02.085
Norm. Take five.
I got a specialist here.


1398
01:36:03.545 --> 01:36:05.797
Bye, Norm.

1399
01:36:10.469 --> 01:36:13.805
Oh, shit. How'd you get here?

1400
01:36:13.972 --> 01:36:17.976
– I'm everywhere, Focker.
– I didn't do anything, Jack.


1401
01:36:18.143 --> 01:36:19.186
Yeah, I know.

1402
01:36:19.352 --> 01:36:22.105
Well, then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.


1403
01:36:22.272 --> 01:36:25.942
I'm not gonna tell anybody anything
until you answer some questions.


1404
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:28.695
Unless you want to spend the next
years of your life in prison,


1405
01:36:28.862 --> 01:36:30.489
you better goddamn well
tell me the truth.


1406
01:36:30.655 --> 01:36:33.784
No more lies. You understand?
No more lies.


1407
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:35.911
– Did you do this?
– Just answer the questions.


1408
01:36:36.119 --> 01:36:38.246
– Have me taken off that airplane?
– Answer the question.


1409
01:36:38.413 --> 01:36:42.334
– Put your hands over there. That's it.
– You're sick, you know that?


1410
01:36:46.379 --> 01:36:49.341
Is your name Gaylord Focker?
Yes or no?


1411
01:36:49.508 --> 01:36:52.511
– Yes.
– Are you a male nurse?


1412
01:36:52.677 --> 01:36:54.679
– Yes.
– Are you a pothead?


1413
01:36:54.846 --> 01:36:56.723
– No.
– Have you ever smoked pot?


1414
01:36:56.890 --> 01:36:58.725
Yes.

1415
01:36:58.892 --> 01:37:01.728
Did you spray-paint the tail of a cat
to pass him off as Mr. Jinx?


1416
01:37:01.895 --> 01:37:03.522
Yes.

1417
01:37:03.688 --> 01:37:05.732
Because you desperately
were seeking my approval?


1418
01:37:05.899 --> 01:37:08.735
– Yes.
– Because you love my daughter Pam?


1419
01:37:08.902 --> 01:37:11.738
– Yes.
– Do you wanna marry her?


1420
01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.742
Do you want to marry her?

1421
01:37:18.161 --> 01:37:21.748
I did, until I met you.

1422
01:37:22.457 --> 01:37:24.042
What does that mean?

1423
01:37:24.209 --> 01:37:27.504
I love your daughter, Jack.
I love her more than anything.


1424
01:37:28.713 --> 01:37:32.217
But frankly, sir, I'm a little terrified
of being your son-in-law.


1425
01:37:32.384 --> 01:37:35.053
This whole weekend
has given me a lot of doubts


1426
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:37.931
about whether or not I could
even survive in your family.


1427
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.896
I think you've got some serious issues.

1428
01:37:46.231 --> 01:37:49.568
If I lighten up, would you consider
marrying my daughter?


1429
01:37:49.734 --> 01:37:51.736
Would you lighten up a lot?

1430
01:37:52.863 --> 01:37:55.073
– Yeah.
– Yes or no?


1431
01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:56.950
– Yes.
– Would you let me and Pam


1432
01:37:57.117 --> 01:37:59.077
live our lives and
not interfere all the time?


1433
01:37:59.244 --> 01:38:02.080
I promise not to interfere
in your lives all the time.


1434
01:38:02.247 --> 01:38:04.583
Will you stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?


1435
01:38:04.749 --> 01:38:08.378
Could you at least try, maybe,
to consider another profession?


1436
01:38:08.545 --> 01:38:10.255
– Jack, yes or no?
– Ever?


1437
01:38:10.422 --> 01:38:12.924
– No!
– OK, yes.


1438
01:38:13.091 --> 01:38:14.926
Would you let me and Pam
sleep in the same room?


1439
01:38:15.093 --> 01:38:18.930
Don't push it, Focker.
You're in a real mess.


1440
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.435
If you married my daughter,
would you support her


1441
01:38:23.602 --> 01:38:25.604
in the way that she
deserves to be supported?


1442
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:27.105
Yes.

1443
01:38:27.272 --> 01:38:29.441
Would you be
honest and faithful to her?


1444
01:38:29.608 --> 01:38:31.359
Yes.

1445
01:38:31.526 --> 01:38:35.947
Will you devote yourself entirely to her
for the rest of your life?


1446
01:38:36.114 --> 01:38:38.200
Of course.

1447
01:38:39.451 --> 01:38:40.702
Gaylord Focker…

1448
01:38:43.205 --> 01:38:45.207
…will you be my son-in-law?

1449
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:10.982
Greg? I thought you were
going back to Chicago.


1450
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:14.361
Yeah, well, we had
a little plane trouble.


1451
01:39:14.527 --> 01:39:16.488
Plus, your dad caught up
with me at the airport.


1452
01:39:17.530 --> 01:39:21.618
No. Don't worry. It's OK.
We worked out a lot of our issues.


1453
01:39:21.785 --> 01:39:24.829
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?


1454
01:39:24.996 --> 01:39:28.750
Yeah. First he gave me his little
human lie detector thing, but I passed.


1455
01:39:28.917 --> 01:39:30.752
Good.

1456
01:39:30.919 --> 01:39:33.463
Yeah, and…

1457
01:39:34.714 --> 01:39:36.800
…then he proposed.

1458
01:39:40.011 --> 01:39:41.262
Are you feeling all right?

1459
01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:49.604
Listen. This weekend was a nightmare.
I had this whole elaborate plan,


1460
01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:53.692
and then somewhere between
giving your sister a black eye


1461
01:39:53.858 --> 01:39:58.029
and setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.


1462
01:40:00.573 --> 01:40:03.201
I just… I love you.
I love you so much.


1463
01:40:04.703 --> 01:40:06.913
And our world just makes sense
when I'm with you.


1464
01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.790
I think he's about to do it, Jack.

1465
01:40:08.957 --> 01:40:12.168
Come on, honey.
Give 'em some privacy.


1466
01:40:14.087 --> 01:40:17.215
And I think if we can get through

1467
01:40:17.382 --> 01:40:20.844
what we got through in the last 48
hours, we could get through anything.


1468
01:40:22.095 --> 01:40:23.596
I think so, too.

1469
01:40:23.763 --> 01:40:26.433
– And, Greg, I don't…
– Wait. Hang on a second.


1470
01:40:26.599 --> 01:40:28.059
Mr. Jinx?

1471
01:40:34.315 --> 01:40:35.859
Hi, Jinx…

1472
01:40:37.736 --> 01:40:39.571
That's a ring.

1473
01:40:40.739 --> 01:40:44.826
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.


1474
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:49.706
Pam?

1475
01:40:49.873 --> 01:40:52.417
– Will you marry me?
– Yes.


1476
01:40:53.752 --> 01:40:55.754
Yes.

1477
01:40:58.757 --> 01:41:00.258
Yes.

1478
01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.971
Attaboy, Greg!

1479
01:41:05.138 --> 01:41:08.099
That «circle of trust» thing?
That's mine.


1480
01:41:11.227 --> 01:41:14.731
Well, looks like we got
another wedding to plan.


1481
01:41:14.898 --> 01:41:17.609
Yep. Just gotta do one more thing.
What's that?


1482
01:41:17.776 --> 01:41:19.402
Meet his parents.

1483
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:22.113
– Jack…
– Honey, relax.


1484
01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.866
I'm sure they're wonderful,
fascinating people.


1485
01:41:26.159 --> 01:41:27.660
Good night, Jack.

1486
01:41:35.627 --> 01:41:38.963
I mean, they'd have to be, right?
To name their son Gaylord Focker.


1487
01:41:42.717 --> 01:41:44.636
Do you, Debra Byrnes,
take Robert Banks


1488
01:41:44.803 --> 01:41:48.181
– to be your lawfully wedded husband?
– Yes. I mean, I do.


1489
01:41:48.348 --> 01:41:50.975
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1490
01:42:08.618 --> 01:42:11.663
Let's just see if you really can
flush the toilet, Jinxy.


1491
01:42:36.855 --> 01:42:38.731
I knew it.

1492
01:42:38.898 --> 01:42:41.609
<i>Shit!</i>

1493
01:42:41.776 --> 01:42:44.445
– I knew it.
<i>– Damn it!</i>


1494
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:55.415
That's my future son-in-law.
What do you think?


1495
01:42:55.582 --> 01:42:57.584
<i>Hello, Jack.</i>

1496
01:42:58.543 --> 01:43:00.670
<i>Oh, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi.</i>

1497
01:43:00.837 --> 01:43:05.175
<i>What's that, Jack? What?
You're a big, bad CIA man, huh?</i>


1498
01:43:05.341 --> 01:43:08.720
<i>They teach you that in the CIA?
They teach you that?</i>


1499
01:43:08.887 --> 01:43:10.930
<i>Oh, yeah. What's that, Jack?</i>

1500
01:43:11.097 --> 01:43:16.060
<i>What? Yeah, you thought Puff was just
the name of the boy's magical dragon?</i>


1501
01:43:16.227 --> 01:43:18.104
<i>Not too quick on the uptake, huh, Jack?</i>

1502
01:43:18.271 --> 01:43:20.565
<i>Why don't you ask Denny
who's puffin' the magic dragon?</i>


1503
01:43:20.732 --> 01:43:24.944
<i>Not onto that one, huh? Surprising
for a big CIA pulse detector.</i>


1504
01:43:25.612 --> 01:43:28.239
<i>Hey, hey, check my pulse
on this question, Jack.</i>


1505
01:43:28.406 --> 01:43:30.492
<i>Do I think you're a psycho? Yes.</i>

1506
01:43:30.658 --> 01:43:34.537
<i>What? Oh, you like my little gift?</i>

1507
01:43:34.704 --> 01:43:37.248
<i>What? The Jerusalem what?</i>

1508
01:43:37.415 --> 01:43:40.418
<i>What? I can't hear you. Jerusalem
toodle-oo-poosey, poosley-loo?</i>


1509
01:43:40.585 --> 01:43:43.254
<i>What? What? Oh, you don't
know shit about flowers.</i>


1510
01:43:43.421 --> 01:43:45.215
<i>What's that? 
You want me to what?</i>

1511
01:43:45.381 --> 01:43:47.258
<i>You have another question?
Sure. I got one question for you.</i>


1512
01:43:47.425 --> 01:43:49.928
<i>It's… Can you deal with that?</i>

1513
01:47:38.656 --> 01:47:40.120
