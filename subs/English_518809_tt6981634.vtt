00:32:32.295 --> 00:32:35.497
Oh. He said that
the lot closes at 5:30.


498
00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:36.434
That's true.

499
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.466
Props, Charles.

500
00:32:38.468 --> 00:32:39.733
Back at you.

501
00:32:39.735 --> 00:32:41.171
You guys know each other?

502
00:32:42.339 --> 00:32:43.307
Yeah.

503
00:32:46.609 --> 00:32:48.042
Look.

504
00:32:48.044 --> 00:32:51.548
Is there any way possible you can
give me a lift to Shelter Island?


505
00:32:52.582 --> 00:32:53.682
Yeah, I could do that.

506
00:32:53.684 --> 00:32:55.016
Oh, good. Awesome.

507
00:32:55.018 --> 00:32:56.187
Ouch!

508
00:32:56.954 --> 00:32:58.156
[groans]

509
00:32:58.422 --> 00:32:59.221
What?

510
00:32:59.223 --> 00:33:01.591
You detached so abruptly.

511
00:33:03.894 --> 00:33:07.295
So without ceremony
of any kind.


512
00:33:07.297 --> 00:33:08.462
I...

513
00:33:08.464 --> 00:33:09.664
I apologize.

514
00:33:09.666 --> 00:33:10.835
It's all right.

515
00:33:12.034 --> 00:33:13.370
Youth.

516
00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.206
You enjoyed the show?

517
00:33:19.208 --> 00:33:23.078
Yeah. Yeah, man. You were...
You were incredible.


518
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.045
You're like a god.

519
00:33:24.047 --> 00:33:25.116
[exclaims]

520
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.351
I can't catch them.

521
00:33:32.022 --> 00:33:34.655
- You okay?
- Yeah.


522
00:33:34.657 --> 00:33:38.862
Just look at these glowy things
flying around my face.


523
00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:43.801
Kale?

524
00:33:44.835 --> 00:33:45.770
Yeah?

525
00:33:46.802 --> 00:33:48.135
Did you have the punch?

526
00:33:48.137 --> 00:33:49.506
- [brakes screeching]
- [grunts]


527
00:33:49.973 --> 00:33:51.442
Ow! Fuck!

528
00:33:52.376 --> 00:33:54.108
[whispers] It's a fairy.

529
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.743
It's a fairy.

530
00:33:55.745 --> 00:33:56.813
It's not a fairy.

531
00:33:57.813 --> 00:33:59.213
The punch was spiked.

532
00:33:59.215 --> 00:34:01.385
It's a group of fairies.

533
00:34:02.418 --> 00:34:04.385
They're meeting
about something.


534
00:34:04.387 --> 00:34:07.257
No. They're not meeting.

535
00:34:09.426 --> 00:34:11.759
- Kale...
- No, it's what they're doing.


536
00:34:11.761 --> 00:34:13.161
Kale, no. What are you doing?

537
00:34:13.163 --> 00:34:15.130
Kale? Kale, get back on the...

538
00:34:15.132 --> 00:34:17.231
What are you doing?
No, Kale. Stop!


539
00:34:17.233 --> 00:34:19.668
Stop! Stop the car. Stop!

540
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.634
Kale, stop!

541
00:34:20.636 --> 00:34:22.439
Just stop, please, stop!

542
00:34:22.973 --> 00:34:24.141
Shh.

543
00:34:24.974 --> 00:34:26.507
Keep your voice down,

544
00:34:26.509 --> 00:34:29.212
or we won't be able to hear
the fairies' secrets.


545
00:34:30.447 --> 00:34:31.582
Okay.

546
00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:35.753
You're hallucinating.

547
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:40.487
So...

548
00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.224
you're just gonna
give me the keys.


549
00:34:43.226 --> 00:34:46.228
Ow! Ow! What the...

550
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.695
You're a muggle.

551
00:34:47.697 --> 00:34:48.929
A muggle?

552
00:34:48.931 --> 00:34:50.667
Like a Harry Potter muggle?

553
00:34:51.134 --> 00:34:52.436
Hey.

554
00:34:53.502 --> 00:34:54.571
Kale.

555
00:34:55.605 --> 00:34:57.741
Kale, get back
in the car! Kale!


556
00:34:58.775 --> 00:34:59.773
Kale?

557
00:34:59.775 --> 00:35:01.076
Kale, get back in the car.

558
00:35:01.078 --> 00:35:02.710
Kale, where are you going?

559
00:35:02.712 --> 00:35:03.945
Kale, give me the keys.

560
00:35:03.947 --> 00:35:05.183
Give me the keys, Kale.

561
00:35:05.782 --> 00:35:07.418
Kale, no! Kale!

562
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.319
Wonderful.

563
00:35:10.052 --> 00:35:11.255
[Kale whistling]

564
00:35:11.688 --> 00:35:12.654
Kale?

565
00:35:12.656 --> 00:35:15.155
[Kale whispering]
Come here. It's okay.


566
00:35:15.157 --> 00:35:17.192
Shh. I'm friendly.

567
00:35:17.194 --> 00:35:18.396
Kale?

568
00:35:18.828 --> 00:35:20.161
Come here.

569
00:35:20.163 --> 00:35:21.831
[Kale whistling]

570
00:35:34.777 --> 00:35:35.879
Okay, then.

571
00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:46.324
[leaves rustling]

572
00:36:16.752 --> 00:36:18.021
I go this way now.

573
00:36:19.889 --> 00:36:20.891
Okay.

574
00:36:22.759 --> 00:36:23.728
You wanna come?

575
00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:25.329
No.

576
00:36:34.603 --> 00:36:37.274
[instrumental music playing]

577
00:36:40.976 --> 00:36:42.712
[dogs barking]

578
00:36:50.353 --> 00:36:52.290
[bells chiming]

579
00:37:07.304 --> 00:37:09.204
That's a great
painting of you.


580
00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:10.474
It's not me.

581
00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:12.974
[laughs] Right.

582
00:37:12.976 --> 00:37:13.911
Right what?

583
00:37:17.313 --> 00:37:18.346
Okay.

584
00:37:18.348 --> 00:37:21.049
Um, could I use your phone?

585
00:37:21.051 --> 00:37:23.418
Sorry. It's a business line.

586
00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.686
It'll only take a second.

587
00:37:24.688 --> 00:37:27.655
I just...
I need to call a cab.


588
00:37:27.657 --> 00:37:31.525
I can't tie up the business
line with personal calls.


589
00:37:31.527 --> 00:37:35.498
What if I let everyone in here
make personal calls, hmm?


590
00:37:36.799 --> 00:37:38.299
Okay.

591
00:37:38.301 --> 00:37:40.036
Might I use your restroom?

592
00:37:40.703 --> 00:37:41.906
Customers only.

593
00:37:43.607 --> 00:37:45.742
I would like one scoop
of rum and raisin, please.


594
00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:50.114
Plain or sugar?

595
00:37:51.715 --> 00:37:52.683
Cup.

596
00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:01.926
Uh, where do you think
you're going?


597
00:38:02.391 --> 00:38:03.493
Bathroom.

598
00:38:04.427 --> 00:38:05.960
I have to ring you up first.

599
00:38:05.962 --> 00:38:09.699
You want me to wait and go in
the bathroom with my ice cream?


600
00:38:10.534 --> 00:38:14.302
I have to ring you up first.

601
00:38:14.304 --> 00:38:15.473
Fine.

602
00:38:24.014 --> 00:38:25.179
Three seventy-nine.

603
00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:28.248
I just realized that I left
my wallet somewhere, okay?


604
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.817
So you're not gonna buy it?

605
00:38:29.819 --> 00:38:31.121
Well, I guess not.

606
00:38:33.223 --> 00:38:34.521
What am I supposed
to do with this?


607
00:38:34.523 --> 00:38:35.722
It's melting.

608
00:38:35.724 --> 00:38:37.090
Excuse me?

609
00:38:37.092 --> 00:38:38.960
I scooped this for you.

610
00:38:38.962 --> 00:38:40.027
It's yours.

611
00:38:40.029 --> 00:38:42.432
I didn't even touch it.
Just put it back.


612
00:38:43.299 --> 00:38:44.699
Can I just put it back?

613
00:38:44.701 --> 00:38:46.768
- Sure, you can!
- Then who's gonna want it?


614
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.869
That'd be like eating
someone else's chewed gum.


615
00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:52.041
That's nothing like eating
someone else's chewed gum, sir.


616
00:38:55.045 --> 00:38:57.212
Mom!

617
00:38:57.214 --> 00:38:58.648
[woman] What is it, Donny?

618
00:38:59.949 --> 00:39:01.516
He said he wanted
to use the bathroom.


619
00:39:01.518 --> 00:39:03.184
I told him the bathroom
is only for paying customers.


620
00:39:03.186 --> 00:39:05.619
- Okay, slow down.
- But he said he's gonna buy ice cream.


621
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.288
- But then he said he doesn't want it.
- Slow down.


622
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:08.889
But now, it's melting!

623
00:39:08.891 --> 00:39:10.895
- Donny...
- I don't know what to do!


624
00:39:11.328 --> 00:39:12.563
In the freezer.

625
00:39:13.797 --> 00:39:14.999
[exhales]

626
00:39:16.532 --> 00:39:17.998
You say you lost your wallet?

627
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.001
Look, I don't even care
about the ice cream.


628
00:39:21.003 --> 00:39:25.005
I just came in here to try and use
the phone so that I can call a cab,


629
00:39:25.007 --> 00:39:28.409
which is irrelevant now
because I don't have a wallet!


630
00:39:28.411 --> 00:39:30.010
Do you need the freezer too?

631
00:39:30.012 --> 00:39:31.081
No!

632
00:39:31.547 --> 00:39:32.849
I'm fine!

633
00:39:33.949 --> 00:39:37.284
So you wanted an ice cream
to make you happy?


634
00:39:37.286 --> 00:39:40.688
No, I only ordered
the ice cream


635
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.061
because otherwise Donny wouldn't let
me use the customers only bathroom.


636
00:39:46.128 --> 00:39:47.695
Donny, soft liquor.

637
00:39:47.697 --> 00:39:50.664
Now, you let this poor boy
who's had a difficult night


638
00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:52.603
go and use our potty.

639
00:39:54.436 --> 00:39:55.705
Thank you.

640
00:39:56.339 --> 00:39:57.607
[toilet flushing]

641
00:40:04.748 --> 00:40:06.614
Everything come out all right?

642
00:40:06.616 --> 00:40:08.853
From the speed of things,
it was number one.


643
00:40:10.252 --> 00:40:11.318
Yep.

644
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.655
Come join us for a treat.

645
00:40:13.657 --> 00:40:15.856
Uh, no, I'd love to,
but I really gotta go.


646
00:40:15.858 --> 00:40:20.764
I thought Donny told you that our
facilities are for customers only.


647
00:40:21.498 --> 00:40:22.800
Join us.

648
00:40:25.168 --> 00:40:26.103
Great.

649
00:40:28.003 --> 00:40:29.005
Thank you.

650
00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:35.111
Here you go.

651
00:40:37.813 --> 00:40:39.582
Aah.

652
00:40:40.884 --> 00:40:41.985
Aah.

653
00:40:45.154 --> 00:40:46.223
Mmm.

654
00:40:48.023 --> 00:40:49.058
Good, isn't it?

655
00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:51.025
Creamy.

656
00:40:51.027 --> 00:40:52.061
Mm-hmm.

657
00:40:53.163 --> 00:40:54.094
Take another.

658
00:40:54.096 --> 00:40:55.195
You know what?
I got this.


659
00:40:55.197 --> 00:40:56.898
Oh.

660
00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.235
- If you don't mind.
- [chuckles]


661
00:41:01.837 --> 00:41:02.973
Mmm.

662
00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:07.043
You know what?
This was...


663
00:41:07.978 --> 00:41:11.014
Mmm. This was great.

by the beach, my friend.


831
00:51:23.993 --> 00:51:26.927
We're at bay side here,
miles away.


832
00:51:26.929 --> 00:51:29.163
No. No, that's not possible.

833
00:51:29.165 --> 00:51:30.697
The GPS in the car
told me I'm right there.


834
00:51:30.699 --> 00:51:34.034
Ah, these things don't tell you
anything about the real world.


835
00:51:34.036 --> 00:51:36.270
But don't worry.
I've got maps.


836
00:51:36.272 --> 00:51:37.438
[Sandy chuckles]

837
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.871
He's really good at maps.

838
00:51:38.873 --> 00:51:40.039
Come have a seat.

839
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:41.942
Oh, I couldn't.

840
00:51:41.944 --> 00:51:45.212
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
to bother you guys.


841
00:51:45.214 --> 00:51:47.514
Oh, we were already up.

842
00:51:47.516 --> 00:51:49.683
Wow. You guys
stay up late.


843
00:51:49.685 --> 00:51:53.286
We always wake up
with the sunrise.


844
00:51:53.288 --> 00:51:54.554
Wait, it's almost dawn?

845
00:51:54.556 --> 00:51:56.322
No, no, no.
Hours to go.


846
00:51:56.324 --> 00:51:58.826
Uh, sunrise is at 5:47.

847
00:51:58.828 --> 00:52:02.096
We like to make love
before dawn. It's just...


848
00:52:02.098 --> 00:52:03.800
so much better that way.

849
00:52:06.534 --> 00:52:08.237
Mm-hmm.

850
00:52:09.038 --> 00:52:10.771
[hums dramatic tune]

851
00:52:10.773 --> 00:52:12.840
I think I've solved
your problem, Alex.


852
00:52:12.842 --> 00:52:14.311
Come over here.

853
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:16.543
Sorry.

854
00:52:16.545 --> 00:52:19.112
So you said

855
00:52:19.114 --> 00:52:22.715
Well, look at this. The GPS
brought you to 3 Ponds Lane here,


856
00:52:22.717 --> 00:52:26.820
but what you really wanted
is 3 Ponds Road in Townhampton.


857
00:52:26.822 --> 00:52:28.721
There's a 3 Ponds Lane
and a 3 Ponds Road?


858
00:52:28.723 --> 00:52:30.391
Yeah, it could be
quite confusing


859
00:52:30.393 --> 00:52:31.724
if you don't know
where you are around here.


860
00:52:31.726 --> 00:52:33.594
But don't worry.
You just go back on the ferry,


861
00:52:33.596 --> 00:52:37.463
you turn here, you turn
here, and you're all set.


862
00:52:37.465 --> 00:52:39.532
So I'll give you this map.

863
00:52:39.534 --> 00:52:41.534
Oh, no,
I can't take your map.


864
00:52:41.536 --> 00:52:46.005
Hey, please, there's nothing
like a good old paper map


865
00:52:46.007 --> 00:52:47.710
to get you back on track.

866
00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:49.976
Thanks, Dan.

867
00:52:49.978 --> 00:52:51.911
Is this yours?

868
00:52:51.913 --> 00:52:53.746
Oh, uh, yeah.
No, thank you.


869
00:52:53.748 --> 00:52:55.549
That must have fallen
out of my pocket.


870
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:57.817
He sees
Dr. Positano, Dan.


871
00:52:57.819 --> 00:52:58.818
Does he?

872
00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.822
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

873
00:53:00.723 --> 00:53:02.221
Why do you say that?

874
00:53:02.223 --> 00:53:03.190
Do you guys know him?

875
00:53:03.192 --> 00:53:04.324
Oh, of course.

876
00:53:04.326 --> 00:53:07.161
Dr. Rock Positano
is the foot whisperer.


877
00:53:07.163 --> 00:53:08.829
Hey, did you go
to his party?


878
00:53:08.831 --> 00:53:10.663
No. There's a party?

879
00:53:10.665 --> 00:53:12.632
[Dan] Yes, yes.
Saturday night.


880
00:53:12.634 --> 00:53:14.735
All his patients
from around here go.


881
00:53:14.737 --> 00:53:16.273
It's supposed to be
a real gas.


882
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.672
Really?

883
00:53:18.674 --> 00:53:21.108
Yes. Actually,
give me the map.


884
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.443
It's not far
from your beaten path.


885
00:53:23.445 --> 00:53:25.646
It's right here on...

886
00:53:25.648 --> 00:53:28.148
Fresh Pond Road,
right there.


887
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:29.918
I'll draw it
right here for you.


888
00:53:31.654 --> 00:53:32.589
There you go.

889
00:53:35.023 --> 00:53:35.956
Thanks.

890
00:53:35.958 --> 00:53:37.324
Hey, hey. Before you leave,

891
00:53:37.326 --> 00:53:40.259
would you like to see
some pictures of our suns?


892
00:53:40.261 --> 00:53:42.496
- Oh.
- Hmm?


893
00:53:42.498 --> 00:53:44.965
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love that.

894
00:53:44.967 --> 00:53:48.134
- This was Capri.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.


895
00:53:48.136 --> 00:53:52.975
Um, the sun rising
on our 40s.


896
00:53:53.375 --> 00:53:54.576
[Sandy] Hmm.

897
00:53:57.779 --> 00:54:01.383
Sun over the Sahara.
Beautiful.


898
00:54:02.317 --> 00:54:03.686
Beautiful.

- Hi.
- Hey.


901
00:54:31.179 --> 00:54:32.980
I just need
to get back across.


902
00:54:32.982 --> 00:54:34.717
Sure. It'll be $1.

903
00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:37.550
A dollar?

904
00:54:37.552 --> 00:54:39.520
Remember, I was in
the car before?


905

Oh, I remember you.

906
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:45.058
Oh, great. So I already
bought a return trip.


907
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.193
For the car.

No, actually, for me,
in the car.

Where is your receipt?

In the car.

Bingo.

Hey.

Sorry, I don't give
handouts to beggars.

Oh, no, no,
I'm not a beggar.


921
00:55:22.965 --> 00:55:26.333
Is there any way
that I could get in the car


922
00:55:26.335 --> 00:55:27.900
and ride across with you?

923
00:55:27.902 --> 00:55:31.405
No, I don't feel
comfortable with that.


924
00:55:31.407 --> 00:55:33.773
Okay. Why not?

925
00:55:33.775 --> 00:55:37.811
Because how do I know that once
we're in an enclosed space,


926
00:55:37.813 --> 00:55:40.784
your maleness
won't take you over?

Because it won't.

It's a three-minute trip.

and unpredictable.

turned around tonight.

tons before.

Oh, nah. Raphael can't see
very well at night.

And watch
the loose gravel, okay?

Thank you.

964

Yeah, but still, he could have
called you a cab or something.

Nah, I like
getting there myself.


966

And we wouldn't
have met, right?


967
00:58:23.911 --> 00:58:29.416

What?

Did you understand
what was going on?


973
00:58:42.831 --> 00:58:47.000
Well, my dad said it was like
I was in this boat,


974
00:58:47.002 --> 00:58:49.068
and I'd fallen out of it
into the water,


975
00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:51.170
and the boat
was never coming back.

- Rock.
- Thanks.


977
00:58:53.708 --> 00:58:56.576
So he told me I needed
to learn how to swim.


978
00:58:56.578 --> 00:58:59.813
Not having a boat
didn't make me weaker.


979
00:58:59.815 --> 00:59:02.719
I didn't need a boat
to get across the ocean.


980
00:59:05.621 --> 00:59:07.420
Sounds like a great dad.

981
00:59:07.422 --> 00:59:09.091
He was, Alex.

982
00:59:10.458 --> 00:59:12.227
He died when I was six.

983
00:59:14.797 --> 00:59:17.329
Yeah, my dad died
when I was young too.


984
00:59:17.331 --> 00:59:18.734
Was he sick?

No.

986
00:59:21.536 --> 00:59:24.272
No, he was swimming
at the beach.

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:26.808
It was a rip tide.

988

Nothing we could do.
