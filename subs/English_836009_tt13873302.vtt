00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.840
[man 1] Something's out there!

7
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.715
Iver, follow them.

8
00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:42.715
Go see what it is, quickly.
Hand me the lantern.


9
00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.298
It's the captain! It's the captain!

10
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:52.423
Whoa.

11
00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:53.340
Whoa!

[ragged breathing]

13
00:01:58.298 --> 00:02:00.006
Sir, did you find anything?

14
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.673
-Help Jørgensen. His feet are frozen.
-[man 2] Right, come on.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.590
[grunts]

16
00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:08.798
-[man 3] Holm's on his way.
-[man 1] Quick, Unger. Get the water.


17
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.548
[man 2] Jørgensen, lift your head up.

18
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.048
-Unger, hurry up with the water.
-It's coming!


19
00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:17.590
-[man 4] Raise it. Easy.
-[man 1] It's all right. We got you.


20
00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:19.923
-We got you.
-[man 4] Take it easy, Jørgensen.


21
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.840
[man 2] Unger, the water.

22
00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:25.173
-Come on!
-[Unger] It's coming.


23
00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:27.423
[man 4] Hold these.
Take it easy, Jørgensen.


24
00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:29.548
[Jørgensen breathing heavily]

25
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:33.173
-Do you have some whiskey?
-[man 1] Yes. Get the man a drink.


26
00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:36.881
[Unger] Here.

27
00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:40.215
Wait, wait.

28
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.131
[captain] I'll take that.

29
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.506
-[man 2] Ejnar, hold him down.
-[Jørgensen exhales]


30
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.756
[man 1] Jørgensen, breathe.
Keep breathing.


31
00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:52.048
Let's do this.

32
00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.340
[Jørgensen breathing heavily]

33
00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:55.465
[Ejnar] Okay.

34
00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:58.131
[Jørgensen grunts]

35
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.298
-[man 4] Hold him.
-[Ejnar] One, two, three.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.173
All right.

39
00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:27.340
-Thank you.
-Got it?


40
00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:29.715
-[sighs]
-Good. Smells like Christmas.


41
00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:32.215
One, two, three.

42
00:03:32.298 --> 00:03:34.215
-Oh!
-[laughs]


43
00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:35.798
-[Ungar] Who's hungry?
-Everybody.

[crew] Starving.

45
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.423
[Ungar] Here we go, boys.

46
00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:39.631
-Looks great.
-Finally.


47
00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:41.965
[man 1] You've done yourself proud,
sunshine.


48
00:03:42.048 --> 00:03:44.798
-It's about time we found a use for you.
-[laughter]


49
00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:47.340
[Ejnar] Gentlemen,
can I have your attention?


50
00:03:47.423 --> 00:03:49.423
-Party's over.
-[man 2] Quiet, Poulsen.


51
00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:52.423
-I want you all to raise your glasses…
-[crew] Of course.


52
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:53.923
[Ejnar] …to…

53
00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:57.715
to loved ones back home,

54
00:03:58.298 --> 00:03:59.881
to the men who gave their lives

55
00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:02.381
exploring the last unknown parts
of our kingdom.


56
00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:05.006
To the Denmark Expedition.

57
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.298
And to you,

58
00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:09.798
for joining me
in fulfilling their mission.


59
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:10.715
Skål.

60
00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:11.631
Skål.

61
00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:12.590
Halfway there.

62
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.798
[Ejnar] Ah!

63
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:17.506
Our long search
didn't go quite as planned.


64
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.048
-Jørgensen can testify to that.
-[quiet chuckles]


65
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:21.381
As expected,

66
00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:24.423
it was hard to trace any signs
of the vanished expedition.


67
00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:26.215
However,

68
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.548
we found this.

69
00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:31.131
A diary from one of the men.

70
00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:35.715
And a map

71
00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:39.131
that apparently shows the location

72
00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:40.590
of the cairn

73
00:04:40.673 --> 00:04:44.715
where Mylius-Erichsen left
his final records of the unknown land.


74
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.631
What's a cairn?

75
00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:49.631
A cairn's a stack of stones
you can see from far away.


76
00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:52.465
So, therefore,
I'll attempt another journey.


77
00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:53.590
[man 2] What?

78
00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:54.631
[Poulsen] Another?

79
00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:57.923
Well, this time further,
across the ice cap,


80
00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.215
to retrieve the findings they left behind.

81
00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:02.673
We're not going home then?

82
00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:03.923
[sighs]

83
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:05.590
This is why we're here, boys.

84
00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:08.673
Without these findings,
the North of Greenland could be lost,


85
00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:10.048
claimed by the Americans.

86
00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:15.090
Now, Jørgensen is incapacitated,

87
00:05:15.173 --> 00:05:16.590
and I can't do it alone,

88
00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:21.256
which provides one of you lucky boys
with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.


89
00:05:22.423 --> 00:05:24.673
I'll need a volunteer to accompany me.

90
00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:47.423
[dogs barking]

91
00:05:55.548 --> 00:05:57.173
Has anyone volunteered yet?

92
00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:01.090
You're kidding, right?

93
00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:02.756
Jørgensen's feet were wrecked.

94
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.631
[Poulsen] Aren't you next in line, Laub?

95
00:06:04.715 --> 00:06:07.173
Shut up, Poulsen. 
Some of us have family.

96
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.881
Why don't any of you
want to go with him?

97
00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:12.090
You saw the map.

98
00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:15.548
It's like walking from Moscow to Rome
looking for a stack of stones.


99
00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:18.215
[Poulsen] Not to mention
doing it with the captain.


100
00:06:18.298 --> 00:06:19.798
Iver knows him all right.

101
00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:22.840
He knew all about him
before he came aboard, right?


102
00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:24.715
I mean, I've read about him,

103
00:06:25.548 --> 00:06:27.381
but everybody has, haven't they?

104
00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:29.381
[scoffs] Not everyone's a fan,

105
00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:30.756
Iver Iversen.

106
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.673
-Not everyone can read. Right, Unger?
-Try reading this!


107
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.506
[mocking cheers]

108
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.756
[laughter]

109
00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:38.548
[Poulsen] Come on!

110
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:53.715
Captain.

111
00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:55.798
Mm.

112
00:06:56.381 --> 00:06:57.215
I was…

113
00:06:58.715 --> 00:06:59.631
just wondering…

114
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.673
[hesitates]

115
00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:06.173
I don't know
how many volunteers you've had already--


116
00:07:06.256 --> 00:07:07.506
Well, that would be none.

117
00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:10.631
[clears throat] What I'm trying to say is

118
00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:13.090
technically, I'm out of a job.

119
00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:14.006
Mm-hm.

120
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.131
As long as we're parked up here,
the motor won't be needed.


121
00:07:18.298 --> 00:07:21.215
I'd like to come with you,
if you'd allow me.


122
00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:25.631
I'm good with a rifle,
and I'm learning how to drive the dogs.


123
00:07:27.215 --> 00:07:28.881
I'd really like to come, Captain.

124
00:07:35.673 --> 00:07:37.798
I'll keep that in mind.
Thank you, Iversen.


125
00:07:41.506 --> 00:07:42.548
Thank you, Captain.

126
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:54.506
[Laub] Poulsen, hand me those harnesses.

127
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.631
-What's Iversen up to?
-[Iver] Come on.


128
00:07:56.715 --> 00:07:58.923
-Looks like he needs a hand.
-[Iver] Stay there.


129
00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:01.673
Hey! Hey!

130
00:08:02.506 --> 00:08:04.090
All of you stay here, okay?

131
00:08:04.173 --> 00:08:05.465
[dogs yap]

132
00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:07.590
[Iver] Okay.

133
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.298
Hey! Hey!

134
00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:11.215
Hey, stop!

135
00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:12.423
Stay there!

136
00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:14.298
-You talk to him.
-[Iver] Hey!


137
00:08:15.798 --> 00:08:17.506
Here, let me give you a hand.

138
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.298
Iversen, the dogs work for you.

139
00:08:23.423 --> 00:08:24.465
Remember that.

140
00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:26.631
Out on the ice,

141
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:30.756
each dog can pull
a hundred pounds of weight from the start.


142
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.965
Once that hundred pounds has been eaten,

143
00:08:33.465 --> 00:08:37.298
well, that dog
becomes surplus to requirement.


144
00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:40.881
So we shoot the worst dog,

145
00:08:41.548 --> 00:08:42.798
feed it to the others.

146
00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:48.631
So, Iversen, don't become best friends.

147
00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:54.881
You've heard Iversen volunteered.

148
00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:57.590
-[Laub] I have, sir.
-What are your thoughts on him?


149
00:08:58.173 --> 00:08:59.548
-Iversen?
-Yeah.


150
00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:00.965
Uh…

151
00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:02.048
He's a good lad.

152
00:09:02.548 --> 00:09:03.756
-Very brave.
-Mm.


153
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840
Strong character.

154
00:09:04.923 --> 00:09:06.590
Have you seen him with the dogs?

155
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.923
Clearly he needs
to work a bit harder to improve.


156
00:09:12.298 --> 00:09:13.881
But you think he can do it?

157
00:09:14.381 --> 00:09:16.256
I believe so, yes.

158
00:09:20.965 --> 00:09:21.798
That's all.

159
00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:24.215
[record playing]

160
00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:27.215
[Unger] Don't be ridiculous.
Surely that's too heavy.

Well, let me show you something.

By my calculations

I've lost us two
weeks' worth of dog food,

372

I've lost us half our tea
and one can of paraffin.

-It's just a dog, Iversen.

Bringing you with me was always a risk,

arm you with the necessary discipline

Captain,

391
00:26:06.756 --> 00:26:08.506
can I ask you a personal question?

392
00:26:09.006 --> 00:26:09.965
[Ejnar] Go on.

393
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.965
Why do you do this?

394
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.840
Keep doing this,

395
00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:18.798
out here, in places like this?

396
00:26:21.715 --> 00:26:23.131
Pretty much alone,

00:26:23.215 --> 00:26:24.340

Don't you have…

399
00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:32.090
Don't you have someone special
at home waiting for you?

00:26:36.006 --> 00:26:37.173
What we do…

401
00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:41.340
you have to travel light.

402
00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:45.340
You can't have your mind
some 2,000 miles away.


403
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.465
So, why do you do this?

404
00:26:49.548 --> 00:26:52.423
Why does anyone do anything?
Why are you a mechanic?

[chuckles]

406
00:26:53.798 --> 00:26:56.381
It's all I was good at, fixing engines.

407
00:26:56.465 --> 00:26:57.381
Exactly.

408
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:04.756
What did they tell you
back when you joined us in Reykjavik?


409
00:27:06.506 --> 00:27:09.006
Well, I know it's
to do with the Americans

410
00:27:10.006 --> 00:27:11.548
and their claim of some land.

411
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:13.506
But, to be honest, Captain,

412
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.381
I was just excited
to go on a trip to Greenland with you


413
00:27:16.881 --> 00:27:18.506
and join a real expedition.

414
00:27:21.381 --> 00:27:23.465
We're talking unknown land, Iversen.

415
00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:26.048
And the Americans claim

416
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:28.798
that the top of Greenland is
separated by a channel


417
00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:30.340
from the rest of the country,

418
00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.506
but no one's proved it yet.

419
00:27:35.673 --> 00:27:37.006
It's important work.

420
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.923
I see.

421
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.256
Might even make you famous, Iversen.

would be queuing up for me.

Well, don't get ahead of yourself.

425
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.840
First, we have to find the bloody thing.

What's your name?

429

-[Iver] She's sweet looking.
-Hm.

-I call her Miss Affection.
-You named her?

Yeah.

-Miss Affection.
-What sort of name is that?

-[Ejnar] What about this one?
-The small, smiley one?

-She'd laugh at the stupid name.

00:28:44.173 --> 00:28:46.340
Is there one
that catches your eye, Captain?

Uh…

445
00:28:50.298 --> 00:28:53.173
[Ejnar] I rather like this one.
Has she got a name?

Not yet.

447
00:28:56.215 --> 00:28:58.923
[Ejnar] I'm going to call her Naja.

448

Yeah. That's Naja.

449

[Iver] Well, then.

should know of any impediment,

we need to make.

-Captain.
-Yes, Iversen?


491
00:33:40.631 --> 00:33:41.840
Well, speak up, man.

492
00:33:43.256 --> 00:33:44.798
Well, we have no supplies.

493
00:33:48.006 --> 00:33:50.006
Is there a point where perhaps we…

No, Captain. That's--

We have a map. 
We will find it.

We won't find it
by standing around talking.

Yes, but--

on the Alabama by August.

[Iver] I think you're right!

but seeing you smile, Captain,
seeing you laugh…

for the two of us,

I was ready to set sail

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.798
So he took me to the red-light district

657
00:47:09.881 --> 00:47:11.381
to introduce me to women,

658
00:47:12.131 --> 00:47:14.340
make sure I wasn't embarrassed
on my travels.


659
00:47:16.215 --> 00:47:18.131
[chuckles] I just went along with it.

660
00:47:18.756 --> 00:47:21.423
Ended up with this older woman.

661
00:47:24.423 --> 00:47:25.548
I must admit,

662
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.965
she did expand my knowledge greatly.

663
00:47:28.756 --> 00:47:29.590
[chuckles]

664
00:47:30.715 --> 00:47:32.215
When I was 16,

665
00:47:32.298 --> 00:47:34.381
my dad took me to the hospital,

666
00:47:35.965 --> 00:47:38.256
to the venereal-disease ward,

667
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:44.340
to show me the dire consequences
of such behavior.


668
00:47:47.423 --> 00:47:48.756
It was fucking disgusting.

669
00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:51.090
[chuckles softly]

670
00:47:54.215 --> 00:47:55.715
[dog whimpers]

00:48:31.298 --> 00:48:32.131

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:37.256
-[grunts]
-What are you doing?


677
00:48:41.465 --> 00:48:43.923
Captain. Captain, stop. Stop!

678
00:48:44.006 --> 00:48:45.881
What are you doing? Stop.

679
00:48:47.381 --> 00:48:48.423
What are you doing?

680
00:48:50.215 --> 00:48:52.548
We have to travel light
if we're gonna make it.


681
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.840
We'll leave everything
that's not absolutely vital.


682
00:48:57.798 --> 00:48:59.756
There's another 200 miles to the ship.

683
00:50:02.465 --> 00:50:04.465
[panting]

684
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.673
[sighs wearily]

685
00:50:43.715 --> 00:50:44.840
We need to cross here.

686
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.673
What?

687
00:50:55.631 --> 00:50:58.256
-Why can't we go around?
-We won't have time.


688
00:51:00.923 --> 00:51:02.256
We need to build a cairn.

689
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.548
You don't think we
can make it, do you?

690
00:51:08.256 --> 00:51:10.840
If we don't, we lose everything.

691
00:51:17.881 --> 00:51:22.756
[Ejnar] At least if the proof
and our journals are kept here in a cairn,


692
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.215
they can be found.

693
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:36.465
Good.

694
00:51:40.215 --> 00:51:41.048
Iversen.

695
00:51:41.881 --> 00:51:42.798
We can do this.

696
00:51:48.006 --> 00:51:50.381
This is what happened
to Mylius-Erichsen, isn't it?


697
00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.173
Let's go.

698
00:52:29.173 --> 00:52:30.048
[groans]

699
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:32.548
[Ejnar] What is it?

700
00:52:33.215 --> 00:52:34.131
[wearily] Nothing.

701
00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:37.381
I just need to
lie down for a second.

702
00:52:38.215 --> 00:52:40.006
-Get up. Come on.
-[groans]


703
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:43.340
[breathless] Come on. Get up.

704
00:52:43.965 --> 00:52:45.590
-[Iver grunts]
-Get up.


705
00:52:49.548 --> 00:52:50.423
[Iver groans]

00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:52.590

[exclaims]

708
00:53:17.131 --> 00:53:17.965
Look.

709
00:53:18.048 --> 00:53:20.256
[wearily] That's the Alabama!

710
00:53:20.965 --> 00:53:22.590
-We're back!
-We're back!


711
00:53:22.673 --> 00:53:23.631
We're back!

712
00:53:24.256 --> 00:53:25.798
The wayfarers are back!

713
00:53:26.381 --> 00:53:27.965
[Iver] Sound the bell!

714
00:53:28.048 --> 00:53:29.798
-[Ejnar laughs]
-Sound the bell!


715
00:53:33.256 --> 00:53:34.798
[panting]

716
00:53:34.881 --> 00:53:36.090
-It's on land.
-What?


717
00:53:36.173 --> 00:53:38.298
The mast, it's on land.

718
00:53:40.923 --> 00:53:42.131
But where's my ship?

719
00:53:45.006 --> 00:53:45.840
I don't know.

720
00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:10.923
They've built a hut
with parts of the ship.


721
00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:14.923
Hello?

722
00:54:16.756 --> 00:54:17.673
Hello?

723
00:54:18.965 --> 00:54:20.798
-Hello?
-Hello?


724
00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.673
[Iver sobs]

725
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:35.381
No, they've left us! 
They've left us!

726
00:54:36.298 --> 00:54:38.298
No! No!

727
00:54:38.381 --> 00:54:40.881
[desperately] No, no!

728
00:54:44.715 --> 00:54:46.215
You just left?

729
00:54:46.965 --> 00:54:48.298
We had no choice, sir.

730
00:54:48.381 --> 00:54:51.381
The Alabama was wrecked,
crushed by the ice.


731
00:54:51.465 --> 00:54:53.673
We had to leave
when we had the chance.

732
00:54:54.173 --> 00:54:56.465
We left enough food
to last at least a year.


733
00:54:56.548 --> 00:55:00.256
-[official] Let's pray they make it back.
-They want more than prayers.


734
00:55:00.756 --> 00:55:04.673
You're asking the government to fund
another rescue attempt. Is that correct?


735
00:55:05.548 --> 00:55:09.631
Lieutenant Laub, it's not your first visit
to the Arctic, is it?


736
00:55:09.715 --> 00:55:11.298
No, sir. It was my fourth.

737
00:55:11.381 --> 00:55:12.881
And Lieutenant Jørgensen?

738
00:55:12.965 --> 00:55:14.173
My fourth also.

739
00:55:14.673 --> 00:55:17.090
And who is this man, Iver Iversen?

740
00:55:19.965 --> 00:55:21.090
Our mechanic, sir.

741
00:55:23.756 --> 00:55:26.048
His name is not
on the original crew list.

742
00:55:26.131 --> 00:55:29.131
[official] No.
He joined Alabama in Reykjavik.


743
00:55:29.215 --> 00:55:30.090
Mm-hm.

744
00:55:30.173 --> 00:55:34.923
And how come a mechanic
is chosen to accompany Mikkelsen


745
00:55:35.006 --> 00:55:36.631
on the second sled journey?

746
00:55:39.756 --> 00:55:41.340
-[minister] Hm?
-He volunteered.


747
00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:43.715
Volunteered. Hm…

748
00:55:45.256 --> 00:55:47.756
Did he have any experience
as an Arctic explorer?


749
00:55:49.173 --> 00:55:50.048
No, sir.

750
00:55:51.006 --> 00:55:53.548
This was his first time in the Arctic.

751
00:55:53.631 --> 00:55:58.423
So, three dead men the first time around
and now two more on the rescue attempt.


752
00:55:58.506 --> 00:56:00.506
Sir, there's no proof that they're--

753
00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:01.423
[scoffs] Proof!

754
00:56:01.506 --> 00:56:03.256
Nobody brings home any proof.

755
00:56:03.756 --> 00:56:07.173
Now, you two both knew
that the chances of success were minimal.


756
00:56:07.256 --> 00:56:10.298
Even less so
when you allow an inexperienced greenhorn


757
00:56:10.381 --> 00:56:12.631
to volunteer for an early death.

758
00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:19.298
I can't possibly justify more expense
on another fruitless mission.


759
00:56:19.381 --> 00:56:21.965
Minister, nobody wants
to waste government funds.


760
00:56:22.048 --> 00:56:22.881
Sir!

761
00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:26.423
We were rescued by a whaler.

762
00:56:27.006 --> 00:56:29.756
Perhaps if we can put up a reward.

763
00:56:30.381 --> 00:56:31.798
Thank you, Lieutenant.

764
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.340
[wind gusts]

765
00:56:45.673 --> 00:56:47.048
[Ejnar] It's gonna be fine.

766
00:56:49.715 --> 00:56:50.548
Is it?

767
00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.756
A ship will come.

768
00:56:57.465 --> 00:57:00.006
-I can't believe they left us.
-Exactly.


769
00:57:00.798 --> 00:57:01.923
How did they leave us?

770
00:57:02.756 --> 00:57:04.923
They got picked up by a passing ship.

771
00:57:05.006 --> 00:57:06.631
The same will happen to us.

772
00:57:09.423 --> 00:57:10.256
If it doesn't?

773
00:57:11.923 --> 00:57:12.756
It will.

774
00:57:19.256 --> 00:57:20.715
[Iver] They think we're dead.

775
00:57:22.173 --> 00:57:23.840
[Ejnar] No one thinks we're dead.

776
00:57:25.298 --> 00:57:26.840
Late summer next year,

777
00:57:27.673 --> 00:57:28.715
a ship will come.

778

[rain patters]

779
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.340
Do you have the postcard?

780
00:58:14.381 --> 00:58:16.131
Imagine if they could see us now.

[sighs]

782
00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:20.173
Probably best they can't.

[chuckles softly]

784
00:58:31.506 --> 00:58:35.090
What would you do if a girl
suddenly came walking towards us


785
00:58:35.173 --> 00:58:36.381
from across the ice?

786
00:58:38.423 --> 00:58:40.381
[scoffs] Well, that's not gonna happen.

787
00:58:40.881 --> 00:58:42.173
No, but if it did?

788
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.006
[sighs]

789
00:58:46.673 --> 00:58:47.631
But how?

790
00:58:48.673 --> 00:58:49.548
I don't know.

791
00:58:50.965 --> 00:58:52.381
Maybe a hot-air balloon.

792
00:58:55.048 --> 00:58:56.340
Like Salomon Andrée.

793
00:58:58.631 --> 00:59:02.006
-Is that the guy that went missing?
-Yeah. I met him once.


794
00:59:02.881 --> 00:59:04.298
I was 15.

795
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:08.590
I walked all the way
from Copenhagen to Gothenburg to see him.


796
00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:11.798
He was gonna fly his hot-air balloon
to the North Pole.


797
00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.631
I wanted to join his expedition.

798
00:59:14.131 --> 00:59:15.423
-At 15?
-Mm.


799
00:59:16.006 --> 00:59:18.631
[sarcastic] Bet he was thrilled
to meet a 15-year-old you!


800
00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:22.215
He explained to me
that I was too young,

801
00:59:23.006 --> 00:59:27.298
but then he paid for me
to catch the train back to Copenhagen.


802
00:59:30.506 --> 00:59:32.215
I guess, in a way,

803
00:59:32.298 --> 00:59:33.465
he saved my life.

-[Iver] Broken though.
-Too bad.


807
00:59:55.631 --> 00:59:56.631

01:30:42.381 --> 01:30:43.423
I'm sorry, Iver.

1149
01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.923
It never happened.

1150
01:30:47.798 --> 01:30:48.631
Okay?

1151
01:30:56.673 --> 01:30:58.173
How much food do we have left?

1152
01:30:59.256 --> 01:31:00.298
[Iver sighs]

1153
01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.840
Hardly any.

1154
01:31:04.965 --> 01:31:08.590
-Ammunition?
-We had two cartridges.

No.

It's a bear!

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.090
Where's the rifle?

1165
01:31:54.923 --> 01:31:56.506
-It's in the storage hut!
-What?

I don't know.

[muffled footsteps]

-Yeah?
-Yeah.


1178
01:33:27.923 --> 01:33:30.506
One chance. One shot. Don't miss.

[heavy breathing]

Okay. Hey.

[panting]

1184
01:33:42.548 --> 01:33:43.923
[man] Give me your weapon.

1185
01:33:45.965 --> 01:33:46.840
You're safe.

1186
01:33:52.548 --> 01:33:53.590
It's okay.

1187
01:33:54.256 --> 01:33:55.840
You're going home now.

[morse code beeping]

1189
01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:24.465
[Neergaard] What is the single
most important task for an explorer?


1190
01:34:26.131 --> 01:34:30.965
When you travel into unknown lands
to discover new parts of the globe,


1191
01:34:32.215 --> 01:34:36.215
it is to ensure the records
of your discoveries


1192
01:34:36.298 --> 01:34:39.173
are delivered back safe and sound,

1193
01:34:40.215 --> 01:34:42.506
with or without you.

1194
01:34:43.381 --> 01:34:46.090
Otherwise, it is all in vain.

1195
01:34:46.965 --> 01:34:51.923
The blood, sweat and tears
would all be for nothing.


1196
01:34:53.256 --> 01:34:56.798
Unlike the honorable members
of the Danish press,


1197
01:34:56.881 --> 01:35:00.590
we in the Danish government
never doubted for a second


1198
01:35:00.673 --> 01:35:04.340
that Captain Mikkelsen
would return home safe and sound.


1199
01:35:06.215 --> 01:35:12.131
We played our part in ensuring
the safe return of a Danish hero.


1200
01:35:12.215 --> 01:35:14.381
[applause]

1201
01:35:14.465 --> 01:35:15.923
So many people in there.

1202
01:35:16.006 --> 01:35:16.840
Mm.

1203
01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:21.590
You know that ship,

1204
01:35:22.506 --> 01:35:23.465
the Titanic?

1205
01:35:23.548 --> 01:35:24.381
Mm.

1206
01:35:25.923 --> 01:35:27.256
It only went and sunk.

1207
01:35:29.673 --> 01:35:31.631
-You wanted to work on that.
-[chuckles]


1208
01:35:33.756 --> 01:35:34.631
Lucky.

1209
01:35:36.131 --> 01:35:37.590
I've always been lucky, me.

1210
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:39.423
No.

1211
01:35:41.548 --> 01:35:42.631
I'm the lucky one.

1212
01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:47.590
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you.


1213
01:35:47.673 --> 01:35:50.173
[Neergaard] …which leads me to read…

1214
01:35:50.256 --> 01:35:51.256
Thank you, Iver.

1215
01:35:52.673 --> 01:35:57.423
"Based on the findings brought back
by Captain Ejnar Mikkelsen,

Yes.

Thank you.

1231
