1
00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:16.857
Chicago.

2
00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.414
A city so diverse,
yet so divided.


3
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:25.005
Make no mistake,
tradition lives here.


4
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.076
You can feel it in the streets.

5
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.837
But you can't be timid.

6
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:33.427
If you want something,
you gotta go get it.


7
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:35.601
It's as simple as that.

8
00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:39.053
It may be a beautiful
place to visit,


9
00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:42.574
but living here is
completely different.


10
00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:45.370
Chicago can either
make you great,


11
00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:47.958
or it could break you bad.

12
00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:50.444
The outcome is dependent on you

13
00:00:50.478 --> 00:00:52.963
and what block you stay on.

14
00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.725
I'm proud to call
this city my home,


15
00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:57.116
'cause ain't no
other city like it.


16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.383
That's on me.

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.558
This city has created
countless legends


18
00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:05.079
and every day I
fight to become one.


19
00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:07.564
But that dream is
nearly impossible


20
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.809
when the entire
environment is against you.


21
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.743
Death.

22
00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:15.089
Drugs.

23
00:01:15.124 --> 00:01:17.436
Corrupt cops, block boys.

24
00:01:19.024 --> 00:01:22.269
It's not your ideal
place to live.


25
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:25.755
It isn't all bad, though.

26
00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.447
Here in Chicago, we
known for our good food


27
00:01:28.482 --> 00:01:31.554
our cool people, our good vibes.

28
00:01:31.588 --> 00:01:35.005
Our superb summers
and our harsh winters.


29
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.253
You can build strong
character here and thrive.


30
00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:45.119
But you need to keep
your head on the swivel


31
00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:47.604
and watch them corners.

32
00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:48.571
♪ This is my life

33
00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:49.986
♪ This is my life

34
00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.920
♪ This is my life in Chicago

35
00:01:52.953 --> 00:01:54.128
♪ This is my life

36
00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:56.613
Hey, you ever thought
about leaving the hood?


37
00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:00.997
For what?

38
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:02.964
Leave the hood for what, bruh?

39
00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.965
The hood been good to me,

40
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.312
I don't know about you, though.

41
00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:08.107
It's all I know,
for real, for real.


42
00:02:08.142 --> 00:02:09.108
Exactly.

43
00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:10.661
The hood is all you know.

44
00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.802
Don't mean it's
been good to you.


45
00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:14.804
I'm going to school down south.

46
00:02:14.838 --> 00:02:18.325
Good weather, good
food, bad females.


47
00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:20.050
You ugly.

48
00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:21.051
I swear to God.

49
00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:22.812
Come with me, bro. You'll see.

50
00:02:22.846 --> 00:02:26.264
The hood ain't what it's
cracked up to be, bro.


51
00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:28.058
Down south?

52
00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:29.336
Down south.

53
00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:31.993
All right bro.
Yeah?


54
00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:34.064
Nah, chill out.
Yeah?


55
00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.033
Chill out, chill out, look.

56
00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:39.069
I'll tell you what.

57
00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:40.519
I'm a go.
Yeah?


58
00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:44.844
It better have everything
you just said, though,


59
00:02:44.868 --> 00:02:45.869
I promise you, bro.

60
00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:48.734
I'm talkin' 'bout if I
don't see Tyler Perry


61
00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.874
and some fine women
down there, bro,


62
00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:51.806
we got a problem.

63
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:53.532
All right, be a
bet, bro, you with me?


64
00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.396
I'm right back to the block.

65
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:56.501
I'm a be right back.

66
00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:58.848
All right, bro.

67
00:02:58.882 --> 00:02:59.882
Hey, bro.

68
00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.368
I'm trustin'.

69
00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:03.346
All right, I ain't gonna
let you down, bro, trust me.


70
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.061
Be safe.
All right.


71
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.345
Yes, he's here now.

72
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.037
Black hoodie, black pants.

73
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.523
Low cut hair in his early 20s.

74
00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:20.421
I need the police now.

75
00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:22.043
Bro, who is you talkin' to?

76
00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:23.217
I'm talking to the police

77
00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:25.012
and I'm calling for you.

78
00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:27.221
You rob my store last time.

79
00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:28.740
I never forget a face.

80
00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.224
Bro, you are tweakin', fam.

81
00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:31.743
I'm tweakin',
bleakin', nothing.


82
00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:33.445
Why would I come back
in a store that I robbed?


83
00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.056
I don't know why
you would come back


84
00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:36.230
to the same store.

85
00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.380
You say you
callin' the police?


86
00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:38.933
The police are on
their way right now.


87
00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:42.236
Look, here go your
money, I'm out. I'm out.


88
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:43.547
The police are coming.

89
00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.377
Where are you
going? Don't leave!


90
00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:46.827
Come back here!

91
00:03:50.934 --> 00:03:52.246
Hey, hands up.

92
00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:54.179
I said hands up now.

93
00:03:56.492 --> 00:03:59.046
Yo, yo, I didn't do nothing.

94
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.530
Don't try me, boy.

95
00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:02.429
I will blow your head off.

96
00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:03.706
Yo, I didn't do nothing.

97
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.890
What's that in your pocket?

98
00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:05.397
That's my wallet.

99
00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:06.536
Don't lie to me.

100
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:08.573
I can see it sticking
out, you got a gun.


101
00:04:08.607 --> 00:04:10.230
I don't have a gun, okay?

102
00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:11.403
He's armed, I need backup.

103
00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:13.163
I'm not armed, okay, look.

104
00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:28.420
Ted, what the hell was that?

105
00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:29.559
He had his hands up.

106
00:04:29.594 --> 00:04:30.733
And he had no weapon.

107
00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:32.193
Look, in the
report, we'll just say


108
00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:33.436
that he resisted
arrest, all right.


109
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.989
This sort of thing
happens all the time.


110
00:04:35.013 --> 00:04:35.910
It's not even the guy.

111
00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:37.740
That means he was
telling the truth.


112
00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:39.096
Look, you need
to get it together


113
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.432
before backup gets here, man.

114
00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.677
No, I'm not covering
for you on this one.


115
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.127
It looks bad and with the
whole Black Lives Matter thing.


116
00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:47.439
I'm so sick about hearing

117
00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:49.407
all of this Black
Lives Matter shit.


118
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.478
We chased down
four murders today.


119
00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:53.963
Nobody cares or notices

120
00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:55.792
and it won't even
make the news, why?


121
00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:57.622
'Cause one young punk
killed another one


122
00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.624
and they were both black.

123
00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:01.211
But when a fine
upstanding officer


124
00:05:01.246 --> 00:05:03.628
such as myself kills a thug,

125
00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:05.319
who was breaking the law,

126
00:05:05.354 --> 00:05:07.977
who happens to be
black, it's a riot


127
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:11.705
and there's protests and
marches and boycotts.


128
00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.328
Look, if they want their
lives to matter to me,


129
00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:16.812
it's gotta matter to them first.

130
00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:19.368
Now tighten it up
before backup gets here.


131
00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.852
You need to get
your story straight


132
00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:22.232
for this report.

133
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.169
That's some bullshit
and you know it.


134
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.710
Reporting live
from the memorial


135
00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:42.356
of the young man, 
Jacob Jackson,

136
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:45.635
who was tragically gunned
down here yesterday evening.


137
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.912
Now, as you can see here,

138
00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:49.536
many have gathered here
because multiple residents


139
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.814
in the neighborhood
claim to have witnessed


140
00:05:51.848 --> 00:05:54.472
that a police officer
actually shot this young man.


141
00:05:54.506 --> 00:05:56.508
Now the police department
spokesman confirms


142
00:05:56.543 --> 00:05:57.889
that they have credible evidence

143
00:05:57.923 --> 00:06:00.857
that this young man
was a known gang member


144
00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:03.550
and this was a
gang-related murder.


145
00:06:03.584 --> 00:06:05.206
Well, for now, the
community is out


146
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.830
in numbers looking for justice.

147
00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:09.866
In the meantime, we'll
see if that happens.


148
00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:12.766
Coming to you live,

00:13:49.739 --> 00:13:50.844
Thank you.

326
00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:52.166
Hey, look, so I was
thinking, you know,


327
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.987
prom next week and I was
wondering if I could take-


328
00:13:56.022 --> 00:13:57.644
Back up off my girl, man.

329
00:13:57.678 --> 00:13:59.508
Hey, man, chill, bro, chill.

330
00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:02.166
Heard what I said, I
told your ass to back up.


331
00:14:03.857 --> 00:14:05.341
What's going on?

332
00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:08.792
Answer me.

333
00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:11.520
Look, Mr. Ragland, we were

334
00:14:11.554 --> 00:14:14.557
just having friendly
conversation.


335
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.353
Clear the hall.

336
00:14:17.388 --> 00:14:18.182
Go home.

337
00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:21.081
It's the weekend, go home.

338
00:14:21.116 --> 00:14:24.119
Ezekiel, I need to talk to you.

339
00:14:26.707 --> 00:14:29.331
Ya'll doing exactly
what they want y'all to do


340
00:14:29.365 --> 00:14:32.058
to end up exactly where
they want y'all to be.


341
00:14:32.092 --> 00:14:33.922
Dead or in jail.

342
00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.579
Get your asses down this hall.

343
00:14:36.614 --> 00:14:37.936
Now why you pullin'
me over here, man?


344
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.859
I wasn't the only
one over there.


345
00:14:39.893 --> 00:14:42.654
Listen, you're
better than this, man.


346
00:14:43.897 --> 00:14:45.081
Why every time there's a fight

347
00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:49.178
or a scuffle, you're
always in the middle of it?


348
00:14:49.213 --> 00:14:50.559
That's gonna get
you nowhere fast.


349
00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:52.388
You need to shape up.

350
00:14:52.423 --> 00:14:53.423
What?

351
00:14:54.943 --> 00:14:57.083
I choose to work here.

352
00:14:58.118 --> 00:14:59.602
I wanna encourage young men

353
00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:01.063

your full potential


354
00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:03.054
and definitely make sure

355
00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:05.815

anger is not going


356
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.439

357
00:15:15.584 --> 00:15:17.137
Thanks, man.

358
00:15:17.172 --> 00:15:19.933
Have a good weekend.

359
00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:22.832

what I told you.


360
00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:25.870

389
00:16:37.838 --> 00:16:39.678
Hey, Ty, look, man, I
ain't see nothing, I swear.


390
00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:40.324
It's no problem.

What didn't you see?

392
00:16:41.773 --> 00:16:42.773
Nothin'.

393
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:45.995
Don't let me find
out you said something


394
00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:48.539
about this shit you didn't see.

395
00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:50.023
I'll kill you.

396
00:16:50.058 --> 00:16:51.024
You hear me?

397
00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:52.232
It's cool.

398
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:55.925
Get the fuck outta here.

399
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.173
Tyler like
a big brother to me.


400
00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:04.416
He know my whole family.

401
00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:09.041
But the difference
between me and Ty


402
00:17:09.077 --> 00:17:10.319
is that he can catch a body

403
00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:13.425
and do it with a
smile on his face.


404
00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:18.948
He took me in after Jacob
got shot by the cops.


405
00:17:18.982 --> 00:17:20.742
He wanted me to join his gang,

406
00:17:20.778 --> 00:17:22.745
but that wasn't for me.

407
00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:26.714
One thing's for
certain about Ty Lord


408
00:17:26.749 --> 00:17:30.581
is that he ain't really no
one you wanna mess with.


409
00:17:32.548 --> 00:17:34.043
Especially if you catch
him doing something


410
00:17:34.067 --> 00:17:35.551
I just saw him do.

411
00:17:36.242 --> 00:17:39.555

00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:54.285

454
00:18:57.633 --> 00:19:00.015
Especially not in Chicago.

00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:03.329

maybe I'll go off to school

to Morehouse in Atlanta.

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:09.300

458
00:19:09.335 --> 00:19:11.992
My grades weren't all that.

459
00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.718
I ain't had no money.

460
00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:14.799
And I didn't play any sports

461
00:19:14.823 --> 00:19:18.344
so I didn't look for
any scholarships.

463

00:20:05.632 --> 00:20:07.876
in the bathroom, so I
bop out to the alley.


488
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.222
The next thing you know,

489
00:20:09.257 --> 00:20:12.191
I'm in a sticky
situation and, man.


490
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:14.893
Look, look, I'm not tryna
hear about none of this.


491
00:20:14.917 --> 00:20:17.403
You know, you know, Carlos,
little Carlos Garcia?


492
00:20:17.437 --> 00:20:18.783
Yeah, buddy down the street.

493
00:20:18.818 --> 00:20:22.718
He wanna work here and he
willing to take less money


494
00:20:22.753 --> 00:20:24.040
and he gonna work
harder than you.


495
00:20:24.064 --> 00:20:26.066
You need to get your
stuff together, bro.


496
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:30.070
I'm doing you a favor by
letting you work here, Jo.


497
00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:31.071
Man, once I go to college,

498
00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.556
I'm out this bad boy.

499
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.592
Ho, about that college.

500
00:20:34.627 --> 00:20:37.250
I been meaning to talk
to you about that, man.


501
00:20:37.285 --> 00:20:40.115
'Cause I need to give
you a reality check.


502
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:41.403
If you been applying to colleges

503
00:20:41.427 --> 00:20:43.405
for two years, I've been
hearing you for two years,


504
00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:45.914
oh, man, when I go to
college, I'm a get up out.


505
00:20:45.948 --> 00:20:49.538
If you haven't been accepted
to a college by now,


506
00:20:49.573 --> 00:20:52.472
it's because you're
unacceptable.


507
00:20:52.507 --> 00:20:54.923
You can't even keep
this shop going.


508
00:20:54.957 --> 00:20:55.717
These are shoes.

509
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:57.374
You think you could take a test?

510
00:20:57.408 --> 00:20:59.144
What you think you fixin'
to go be, a doctor?


511
00:20:59.168 --> 00:21:00.446
Or a lawyer or something.

512
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.275
You need to get a simple job,

513
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.071
'cause you a simple
minded person.


514
00:21:05.105 --> 00:21:05.899
Okay?

515
00:21:05.934 --> 00:21:08.005
Won't you just
fire me then, bro?


516
00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:09.420
If that's true how you feel,

517
00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:11.111
won't you just fire me then?

518
00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:12.157
You don't want the truth, man.

519
00:21:12.181 --> 00:21:15.081
I do want the truth, tell me.

520
00:21:15.115 --> 00:21:16.116
Look, man.

521
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:20.120
Your pops was like a
big brother to me, man.


522
00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.950
Now when he got locked up,

523
00:21:21.984 --> 00:21:23.814
I told him I'd, you
know, keep you working,


524
00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:26.334
try to keep you out the streets.

525
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:29.337
So, look man, get it together

526
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.477
and like I said,
when I come back


527
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:34.687
this place better be how
it's supposed to be, man.


528
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:36.620
I got business to handle.

529
00:21:36.654 --> 00:21:38.277
I'm a business owner.

530
00:21:38.311 --> 00:21:39.692
Step your game up. Get to work.

531
00:21:39.726 --> 00:21:41.625
All right, all right, Grady.

532
00:21:41.659 --> 00:21:43.040
Have a great day, man.

533
00:21:43.074 --> 00:21:44.697
I will.

Yo, what's up.

574
00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:22.070
I got your check, man,

575
00:23:22.104 --> 00:23:23.071
you a little jumpy, bro.

576
00:23:23.105 --> 00:23:23.796
Here.
Okay.


577
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.901
Thanks bro, I appreciate it.

578
00:23:25.936 --> 00:23:28.076
Relax, man, say no to drugs.

579
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.560
You way too jumpy, bro.

580
00:23:29.595 --> 00:23:32.287
All right, Grady,
man, take it easy, man.


581
00:23:44.851 --> 00:23:46.922
Growing up on the
west side of Chicago,


582
00:23:46.957 --> 00:23:50.443
I ain't really had my parents.

583
00:23:50.478 --> 00:23:52.894
My dad got locked
up for 22 years


584
00:23:52.928 --> 00:23:56.449
and he's still in
there riding the wave.


585
00:23:56.484 --> 00:23:59.866
I know that's a place
I never wanna be.


586
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:03.629
And as far as my mom, Debbie,

587
00:24:06.804 --> 00:24:09.945
man, I don't even
wanna talk about her.


588
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.949
But luckily for me, I
have my grandparents.


589
00:24:15.882 --> 00:24:18.091
They looked out for me.

590
00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:18.816
They cared for me.

591
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:21.509
They kept me off the streets.

592
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.200
And they love me.

593
00:24:33.037 --> 00:24:35.177
They say it's
probably drug related,


594
00:24:35.212 --> 00:24:36.696
but who knows.

595
00:24:36.731 --> 00:24:38.008
We're still getting testimonies

596
00:24:38.042 --> 00:24:40.666
from the witness and it was
three shots in the back.


597
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.184
It might have been
a new recruit.


598
00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:44.359
Three shots in the back.

599
00:24:44.393 --> 00:24:45.671
I'm gonna finish up in a sec,

600
00:24:45.705 --> 00:24:47.258
excuse me a moment.

601
00:24:48.259 --> 00:24:50.227
Sorry, Green, you can't
be here right now.


602
00:24:50.261 --> 00:24:51.608
What is you talkin' about, LT,

603
00:24:51.642 --> 00:24:53.195
what's going on?

604
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.647
Listen, Green, it's
your son right there.


605
00:24:56.682 --> 00:24:58.062
What?
What?


606
00:24:58.753 --> 00:24:59.788
I'm sorry.

607
00:24:59.823 --> 00:25:00.824
Hey, I, goddamn, I.

608
00:25:00.858 --> 00:25:01.825
Detective Green, I know.

609
00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:04.172
You cannot be here right now.

610
00:25:04.206 --> 00:25:05.242
See, that's my son,

611
00:25:05.276 --> 00:25:06.726
I gotta see my son.

612
00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:08.625
I'm sorry. Later.

613
00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:10.212
Don't do this right here, LT.

614
00:25:10.247 --> 00:25:11.041
Later.
LT.


615
00:25:11.075 --> 00:25:12.180
Don't worry.

616
00:25:12.214 --> 00:25:13.699
LT, you serious?

617
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:26.273
I'm sure Ty Lord
had killed more people


618
00:25:26.297 --> 00:25:27.540
in that alley.

619
00:25:27.575 --> 00:25:30.094
I heard the shots
when I ran off.


620
00:25:30.129 --> 00:25:33.373
I knew that was
unfinished business.


621
00:25:34.064 --> 00:25:37.895
I knew I had to deal with
Ty Lord sooner or later,


622
00:25:38.724 --> 00:25:40.933
but to be honest, I
didn't wanna talk to him,


623
00:25:40.967 --> 00:25:42.210
I didn't wanna see him,

624
00:25:42.244 --> 00:25:45.489
I didn't want nothing
to do with him.


625
00:25:46.594 --> 00:25:49.976
But I knew I had to
settle that first.


626
00:25:56.569 --> 00:25:58.537
How Granny doing?

627
00:25:58.571 --> 00:25:59.710
She cool.

628
00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:01.229
Yeah.
Yeah.


629
00:26:02.161 --> 00:26:03.576
She good?

630
00:26:03.611 --> 00:26:04.726
You don't fuck with Granny, man.

631
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.717
She used to always
fuck with niggas,


632
00:26:06.752 --> 00:26:08.029
especially for Halloween, man.

633
00:26:08.063 --> 00:26:10.756
I would trick or
treat on the block.


634
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.078
I knew your granny
was gonna give me


635
00:26:12.102 --> 00:26:13.966
some extra shit.

636
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.900
That's how Granny is.

637
00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:19.419
How your whole family is.

638
00:26:20.282 --> 00:26:23.113
Your whole family
be holding me down.


639
00:26:24.114 --> 00:26:26.288
That's why fuck with y'all, man.

640
00:26:27.117 --> 00:26:30.120
It's hard to find
family out here.


641
00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:33.813
You know, I don't
really got much, man.


642
00:26:34.952 --> 00:26:37.127
I didn't have a granny.

643
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.544
Your granny my granny.

644
00:26:44.997 --> 00:26:47.965
You understand what I'm saying?

645
00:26:51.797 --> 00:26:54.213
I swear that trust is real.

646
00:26:55.973 --> 00:26:57.975
It's real important to me.

647
00:26:59.045 --> 00:27:02.393
I'm happy to have your trust.

648
00:27:06.846 --> 00:27:09.159
What make you say that?

649
00:27:09.815 --> 00:27:10.954
I mean-

650
00:27:10.988 --> 00:27:12.680
Nigga, the only
reason I fuck with you,


651
00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:14.164
only reason I let
you in this shit


652
00:27:14.198 --> 00:27:16.511
is because of your family.

653
00:27:18.133 --> 00:27:20.929
I fuck with y'all, nigga.

654
00:27:20.964 --> 00:27:24.001
That don't mean I fuck with you.

655
00:27:25.658 --> 00:27:27.177
What you mean?

656
00:27:29.697 --> 00:27:34.184
You know, Ty I know you don't
wanna be messed with, man.


657
00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:37.394
Who brought you in this shit?

658
00:27:37.428 --> 00:27:39.189
You did.

659
00:27:56.724 --> 00:27:57.690
Was that you
smoking a cigarette


660
00:27:57.725 --> 00:27:59.692
or was the Tyler?

661
00:27:59.727 --> 00:28:00.693
It wasn't me.

662
00:28:00.728 --> 00:28:02.005
Better not be.

663
00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:03.834
You know your uncle
died of lung cancer.


664
00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:04.835
Yeah, I remember.

665
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.699
And don't hang around Tyler.

666
00:28:06.734 --> 00:28:08.252
I heard he is the
biggest gang banger


667
00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:09.840
on the west side.

668
00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:11.048
Well, we grew up together.

669
00:28:11.083 --> 00:28:12.671
Just because you
grow up with somebody


670
00:28:12.705 --> 00:28:14.880
don't mean you
shouldn't grow apart.


671
00:28:14.914 --> 00:28:15.984
He already got three kids

672
00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:17.848
by three different women,

673
00:28:17.883 --> 00:28:20.540
no job and dropped
out of school.


674
00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:21.921
He may think it's okay now.

675
00:28:21.956 --> 00:28:25.856
But in 10 years, he's
gonna realize his mistakes.


676
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:28.687
I don't want that
to happen to you.


677
00:28:28.721 --> 00:28:29.860
You got a nice job,

678
00:28:29.895 --> 00:28:31.379
going to a good school

679
00:28:31.413 --> 00:28:34.693
and you gonna go on
and go to college.


680
00:28:34.969 --> 00:28:36.556
I'm proud of you.

681
00:28:36.591 --> 00:28:39.249
You already doing better than
you mother and father did


682
00:28:39.283 --> 00:28:40.284
at your age.

683
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.563
Don't mean much,
but it's something.


684
00:28:43.598 --> 00:28:44.944
All you gotta do is good

685
00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:47.222
and good things
will come to you.


686
00:28:47.257 --> 00:28:48.430
Do what's right.

687
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.605
I'm trying.

688
00:28:52.676 --> 00:28:55.196
Speaking of your mother.

689
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.646
They let Debbie out of rehab?

690
00:28:57.681 --> 00:28:59.752
She's out and she wants
to spend some time you.


691
00:28:59.787 --> 00:29:01.074
Aw, man, she ain't
wanna spend time


692
00:29:01.098 --> 00:29:03.583
with me when she was trying
to sell me for crack.


693
00:29:03.618 --> 00:29:05.447
Or when she threw daddy in jail.

694
00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:07.415
She the reason why this
whole family bogus now.


695
00:29:07.449 --> 00:29:09.797
Listen, I understand
the anger you feel,


696
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.075
but she's still your mother.

697
00:29:12.109 --> 00:29:14.077
It's not gonna kill you
to spend one day with her


698
00:29:14.111 --> 00:29:16.631
and it actually might help her.

699
00:29:17.632 --> 00:29:19.910
Granny, I don't wanna see her.

700
00:29:19.945 --> 00:29:21.912
Well, she's gonna
be here in the morning


701
00:29:21.947 --> 00:29:24.639
and you need to be respectful.

702
00:29:24.673 --> 00:29:26.330
Your mother loves you

703
00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:30.507
and how you treat her will
have a big impact on her.


704
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:32.543
All right, yes, ma'am.

705
00:30:02.988 --> 00:30:06.094
Angel, girl, you
walked all way over here?


706
00:30:06.129 --> 00:30:07.130
I came to say thank you.

707
00:30:07.164 --> 00:30:08.545
Thank you for what?

708
00:30:08.579 --> 00:30:10.961
For showing me that
you really wanna be with me.


709
00:30:10.996 --> 00:30:13.999
I mean, I do, shoot,
what's going on.


710
00:30:14.033 --> 00:30:16.553
You killed Tez just so
you could take me on prom?


711
00:30:16.587 --> 00:30:17.968
No, girl, I ain't killed,

712
00:30:18.003 --> 00:30:18.969
I ain't killed nobody.

713
00:30:19.004 --> 00:30:19.970
What you talkin' about?

714
00:30:20.005 --> 00:30:20.937
It's okay, you
don't have to lie.


715
00:30:20.971 --> 00:30:21.972
I know the truth.

716
00:30:22.007 --> 00:30:24.285
Nah, I ain't, I
ain't kill nobody.


717
00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:26.494
Don't be saying nothing
like that about me.


718
00:30:26.528 --> 00:30:28.358
I ain't killed nobody.

719
00:30:30.015 --> 00:30:32.845
It's okay,
you don't have to lie.


720
00:30:36.884 --> 00:30:38.195
Angel!

721
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.852
Angel!

722
00:30:39.887 --> 00:30:40.887
Angel!

723
00:30:48.102 --> 00:30:50.518
You shot me, bruh?

724
00:30:50.552 --> 00:30:51.553
Did you shot me?

725
00:31:06.258 --> 00:31:07.891
It smell so good,
what you got over there?


726
00:31:07.915 --> 00:31:09.054
Well, you need to learn

727
00:31:09.088 --> 00:31:11.780
how to make this so you
can get you a husband.


728
00:31:11.815 --> 00:31:14.335
Ma, ain't no
recipe gonna keep no man.


729
00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:16.026
This oven and this stove

730
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:17.545
is how you keep a man.

731
00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:19.547
Well, I guess that's
how you kept Daddy, huh.


732
00:31:19.581 --> 00:31:21.066
Mm-hmm, got that right, girl.

733
00:31:26.795 --> 00:31:27.795
Son.

734
00:31:28.763 --> 00:31:29.763
I miss you.

735
00:31:31.076 --> 00:31:32.111
I'm so proud of you.

736
00:31:32.146 --> 00:31:33.285
I love you.

737
00:31:35.943 --> 00:31:37.530
Don't you miss your mama?

738
00:31:37.565 --> 00:31:38.911
Yeah.

739
00:31:38.946 --> 00:31:40.257
You hungry?

740
00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:44.468
Nah, Granny, I done
lost my appetite.


741
00:31:49.404 --> 00:31:51.648
I'm not fittin' to
keep kissin' his ass.


742
00:31:51.682 --> 00:31:52.787
You have to be patient.

743
00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:53.926
You can't criticize him.

744
00:31:53.961 --> 00:31:57.033
When you made your
mistakes, he had to cope.


745
00:31:57.067 --> 00:31:58.758
He did everything he
was supposed to do,


746
00:31:58.793 --> 00:31:59.932
even when you weren't there.

747
00:31:59.967 --> 00:32:02.072
But I'm here now.

748
00:32:02.107 --> 00:32:03.739
How long y'all gonna
keep throwin' this shit


749
00:32:03.763 --> 00:32:05.593
in my face, I'm clean.

750
00:32:05.627 --> 00:32:06.939
Instead he come
up here and kiss,


751
00:32:06.974 --> 00:32:08.907
I'm not gonna keep
kissin' his ass.


752
00:32:08.941 --> 00:32:11.944
How long y'all gonna,
I can't do this.


753
00:32:11.979 --> 00:32:13.981
I come home and get
myself clean just


754
00:32:14.015 --> 00:32:15.292
to get treated like an animal

755
00:32:15.327 --> 00:32:17.225
by my own flesh and blood.

756
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.468
Oh, baby, come on now.

757
00:32:18.502 --> 00:32:19.641
No, no, Ma.

758
00:32:19.676 --> 00:32:21.091
We love you.

759
00:32:21.126 --> 00:32:22.575
Everybody calm down.

760
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.749
I am calm.

761
00:32:23.783 --> 00:32:25.682
I get myself together
just to get treated


762
00:32:25.716 --> 00:32:27.477
like I'm the villain.

763
00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.800
I ain't really
know Tez like that.


764
00:32:40.835 --> 00:32:42.802
I just knew him as a
kid who always wanted


765
00:32:42.837 --> 00:32:45.978
to start something in school.

766
00:32:46.013 --> 00:32:47.128
I think it's because his dad

767
00:32:47.152 --> 00:32:49.188
was a cop or a detective.

768
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.985
He used to chat how
his dad ran the world,


769
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.160
or the west side at least.

770
00:32:57.024 --> 00:32:58.991
All I know is
that he was no one

771
00:32:59.026 --> 00:33:01.131
you really wanted to
mess with neither.


772
00:33:01.166 --> 00:33:04.341
If he wanted you
dead, you was dead.


773
00:33:05.032 --> 00:33:06.147
That don't sound
like the detective


774
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:08.587
who's protecting and serving.

775
00:33:14.834 --> 00:33:15.904
Got that last night.

776
00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:17.054
Yeah, look like somebody, bro.

777
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:18.228
About to walk up on some shit.

778
00:33:18.252 --> 00:33:20.840
Shit, just might, just might

779
00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:22.118
up in this motherfucker.

780
00:33:22.152 --> 00:33:23.878
Dude got a vest on.

781
00:33:23.912 --> 00:33:25.190
You seen him?

782
00:33:25.224 --> 00:33:28.227
Going pretty fast out here, man.

783
00:33:28.262 --> 00:33:29.228
Going fast?

784
00:33:29.263 --> 00:33:30.989
Yeah, you was going fast.

785
00:33:31.023 --> 00:33:31.990
Smoky, man.

786
00:33:32.024 --> 00:33:33.646
Hey, how you doing?

787
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:34.889
You seen him?

788
00:33:34.923 --> 00:33:36.649
You ain't seen him.

789
00:33:36.684 --> 00:33:37.684
Nah?

790
00:33:38.203 --> 00:33:40.515
Nah, man, ain't
nobody seen him.


791
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.069
I mighta.

792
00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:44.071
What you mean you mighta?

793
00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:45.531
Give me a dollar
or two or something.


794
00:33:45.555 --> 00:33:46.832
Give me a couple of dollars.

795
00:33:46.866 --> 00:33:48.396
Ain't seen nothing,
ain't heard nothing, man.


796
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.042
You ain't heard nothing.

797
00:33:50.077 --> 00:33:51.078
I mighta seen it?

798
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.112
Where?

799
00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.702
On the streets.

800
00:33:54.736 --> 00:33:55.737
Smoky, oh.

801
00:33:56.738 --> 00:33:58.095
Man, let me have
a couple of dollars.


802
00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.051
You gotta give me something.

803
00:33:59.086 --> 00:34:00.052
Give me something.

804
00:34:00.087 --> 00:34:02.227
You gotta give me something.

805
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:08.440
Look, son, I love you.

806
00:34:08.474 --> 00:34:11.891
I ain't tryna hear
you right now, Deb.


807
00:34:11.926 --> 00:34:14.101
What more do you want from me?

808
00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:15.170
I'm here, I'm clean.

809
00:34:15.205 --> 00:34:16.379
Like what more do you want?

810
00:34:16.413 --> 00:34:18.864
First off, you need to
stop yelling at Granny.


811
00:34:18.898 --> 00:34:21.108
You know she got high
blood pressure, man.


812
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:23.902
Look, all those nights
when I was out there


813
00:34:23.938 --> 00:34:25.043
feigning for another hit,

814
00:34:25.077 --> 00:34:27.079
do you know how that
made me feel knowing


815
00:34:27.114 --> 00:34:28.598
all the pain I put you through.

816
00:34:28.632 --> 00:34:30.772
I mean, I'm clean,
I did this for you.


817
00:34:30.807 --> 00:34:32.567
I'm doing this for y'all.

818
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:34.016
Man, pain?

819
00:34:34.638 --> 00:34:36.536
The pain you felt when
you was out there?


820
00:34:36.571 --> 00:34:38.263
You was trying to
forget about me.


821
00:34:38.297 --> 00:34:39.471
Son, you gotta let that go.

822
00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:41.714
I'm here now, what
more do you want?


823
00:34:41.748 --> 00:34:43.094
No.

824
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.958
I can't do nothin' with you.

825
00:34:46.443 --> 00:34:49.826
I can't do this
with you right now.


826
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.344
I'm your mother.

827
00:35:12.814 --> 00:35:17.647
Damn, it's a real treat
when two playas meet.


828
00:35:17.681 --> 00:35:18.681
Man.

829
00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:20.857
Ooh, wee.

830
00:35:20.891 --> 00:35:22.790
Get this money.

831
00:35:22.824 --> 00:35:26.656
Yeah yeah, I ain't
here for the money, man.


832
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.002
It was a murder.

833
00:35:28.865 --> 00:35:31.109
A boy got shot in an alley.

834
00:35:31.143 --> 00:35:33.283
Know anything about that?

835
00:35:33.318 --> 00:35:35.803
No, don't know
nothing about that, man.


836
00:35:35.837 --> 00:35:38.185
That's not good business.

837
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:39.876
Yeah, it ain't.

838
00:35:40.842 --> 00:35:42.154
How about you?

839
00:35:42.189 --> 00:35:43.707
Y'all know what's up, right?

840
00:35:43.742 --> 00:35:45.640
I don't know
what's up, what's up?


841
00:35:45.675 --> 00:35:46.710
You tell us.

842
00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:48.056
You ain't hear about nothing?

843
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:50.058
I ain't heard nothing.

844
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:53.683
Still know our
agreement, right?


845
00:35:53.717 --> 00:35:56.168
Yeah, I could've locked
you up a long time.


846
00:35:56.203 --> 00:35:57.203
Still can.

847
00:36:00.103 --> 00:36:01.553
Shay, you, too.

848
00:36:02.519 --> 00:36:04.659
I don't know nothing.

849
00:36:05.867 --> 00:36:08.353
So how long you think I need?

850
00:36:08.387 --> 00:36:11.149
Hey, give me
a couple days, man.


851
00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:12.978
Maybe less.

852
00:36:13.012 --> 00:36:14.842
I'll reach out to you.

853
00:36:16.361 --> 00:36:17.327
It's times like these

854
00:36:17.362 --> 00:36:19.916
where I wonder where is God?

855
00:36:21.055 --> 00:36:22.919
Why am I here?

856
00:36:22.953 --> 00:36:24.196
Why my dad in prison?

857
00:36:24.231 --> 00:36:27.303
Why my mom in and out of rehab?

858
00:36:27.337 --> 00:36:30.133
Why can't I get into Morehouse?

859
00:36:31.065 --> 00:36:33.171
But then I remember.

860
00:36:33.205 --> 00:36:35.345
I can't alter my past.

861
00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.210
All I can do is
live in my present


862
00:36:38.245 --> 00:36:40.592
and try to change my future.

863
00:36:40.626 --> 00:36:42.214
That's why it's
good to have people


864
00:36:42.249 --> 00:36:46.805
you can call your homie for
the better things in life.


865
00:36:47.909 --> 00:36:52.569
I guess I get the saying
laugh to keep from crying.

00:37:26.396 --> 00:37:27.432
Loud.

885
00:37:28.191 --> 00:37:29.365
You can't prove it that

886
00:37:29.399 --> 00:37:31.401
I know you gonna get
high with your boy, Dove.


887
00:37:31.436 --> 00:37:33.817
I can't even do it, bro.

888
00:37:35.094 --> 00:37:36.061
Come on, man, roll up.

889
00:37:36.095 --> 00:37:37.959
I got you, I got you.

890
00:37:37.994 --> 00:37:40.030
Hey, what we on tonight?

891
00:37:41.963 --> 00:37:43.102
What?

892
00:37:43.137 --> 00:37:44.587
Have you not been on Facebook?

893
00:37:44.621 --> 00:37:46.174
Instagram? Snapchat?

894
00:37:46.209 --> 00:37:48.453
Come on. Wake up.

895
00:37:48.487 --> 00:37:49.602
I was rushing out the crib

896
00:37:49.626 --> 00:37:50.834
and forgot my phone at home.

897

00:38:08.335 --> 00:38:09.301
It's early.

905
00:38:09.336 --> 00:38:10.336
Exactly.

906
00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:14.168

00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:29.942

00:38:49.686 --> 00:38:51.388
A pair of Mike's for

You have on the Space Jams.

932

They don't come out for
the next three weeks.


933
00:39:07.532 --> 00:39:08.636
Facts, facts, facts.

934
00:39:08.671 --> 00:39:11.812
Well, playas do what they want,

935
00:39:11.846 --> 00:39:13.883
squares do what they can.

936
00:39:13.917 --> 00:39:15.091
Man, please.

937

Hey, but, uh,

942
00:39:28.622 --> 00:39:30.865
What I tell you about
being so thirsty, bro?


943
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.351
For real, but her
girlsie is coming,


944
00:39:33.385 --> 00:39:35.491
so she supposed
to be coming, too.


945
00:39:35.525 --> 00:39:36.768
Cool, cool, cool.

946
00:39:36.802 --> 00:39:40.219
Well, you know, I

948
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:48.055
What?

949
00:39:48.089 --> 00:39:50.437
Look at me eye to eye.

950
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:53.060
You have murdered that blunt.

951
00:39:53.094 --> 00:39:53.888
It's dead.

952
00:39:53.923 --> 00:39:55.373
Deader than Michael Jackson.

953
00:39:55.407 --> 00:39:57.409
Now how am I supposed
to be higher,


954
00:39:57.444 --> 00:39:59.549

00:39:59.584 --> 00:40:00.723
How, talk to me.

00:40:00.757 --> 00:40:04.071
That blunt is, it's a wrap.

957
00:40:04.105 --> 00:40:06.073
It's no coming back.

958
00:40:06.107 --> 00:40:08.420
All right, let me

959
00:40:08.455 --> 00:40:09.421
Let me breathe.

960
00:40:09.456 --> 00:40:12.113
Doctor always say breathe, Chad.

961
00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.426
Let me stop the playing.

962
00:40:14.461 --> 00:40:15.738
I ain't about that.

963
00:40:15.772 --> 00:40:18.326
You should be mad at yourself.

964
00:40:18.361 --> 00:40:20.087
Hey, man, fuck you, anywho,

965
00:40:20.121 --> 00:40:22.089

00:40:27.474 --> 00:40:28.613
What you mean?

970
00:40:28.647 --> 00:40:30.442
Man, I done saw my
mom for the first time


971
00:40:30.477 --> 00:40:31.961
in a long time.

972
00:40:31.995 --> 00:40:34.308
I don't remember the
last time I seen your moms.


973
00:40:34.342 --> 00:40:35.999
Man, 'cause she say in rehab.

974
00:40:36.034 --> 00:40:39.002
Like all my life
she been in rehab.


975
00:40:39.037 --> 00:40:41.280
Damn, like, but
this time, though,


976
00:40:41.315 --> 00:40:43.455
I could tell things
are a little different,


977
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:44.594
like I know she love me,

978
00:40:44.629 --> 00:40:45.768
she care and everything.

979
00:40:45.802 --> 00:40:46.769
My pop was the same way,

980
00:40:46.803 --> 00:40:48.598
in and out of rehab, you know,

981
00:40:48.633 --> 00:40:49.953
then the next
minute he wanna bond


982
00:40:49.979 --> 00:40:54.155
and next thing you
know, my PS4 missing.


983
00:40:54.811 --> 00:40:56.088
Bro, but this different.

984
00:40:56.123 --> 00:40:56.986
This my moms.

985
00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.781
Granny always saying
be nice to people


986
00:40:58.815 --> 00:41:00.127
when people aren't nice to you.

987
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:01.646
You gotta stop,
you gotta stop.


988
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.302
You gotta stop listening
to your grandma.


989
00:41:03.337 --> 00:41:04.269
She too old.

990
00:41:04.303 --> 00:41:05.488
And to keep it a buck with you,

991
00:41:05.512 --> 00:41:07.790
I ain't tryna hear
about your mama issues.


992
00:41:07.824 --> 00:41:09.585
I need you keep
real with me, like,


993
00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:11.310
I been your man

994
00:41:11.345 --> 00:41:12.760
and the streets talking.

995
00:41:12.795 --> 00:41:14.831
Man, I am keeping
it real with you bruh,


996
00:41:14.866 --> 00:41:16.005
I ain't even told nobody.

997
00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:17.006
You the only person that know.

998
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.293
You wanna know the real reason

999
00:41:18.317 --> 00:41:19.640
why this party gonna
be lit at 2 o'clock?


1000
00:41:19.664 --> 00:41:21.020
'Cause it's your
birthday, nigga.


1001
00:41:21.044 --> 00:41:23.978
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, I
done have plenty birthdays,


1002
00:41:24.013 --> 00:41:27.465
20 birthdays before
this to be exact.


1003
00:41:27.499 --> 00:41:29.018
Wait, hold up.

1004
00:41:29.052 --> 00:41:30.053
Your ass 21?

1005
00:41:32.504 --> 00:41:34.713
Boy, you still in high school.

1006
00:41:34.748 --> 00:41:37.682
When you gonna graduate
with your dumb ass, boy,


1007
00:41:37.716 --> 00:41:40.961
you goofy as hell.

1008
00:41:40.995 --> 00:41:43.826
Boy, what, flame, I dare you.

1009
00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:46.553
That's what I thought.

1010
00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:47.668
Stop playin'
with me, for real.


1011
00:41:47.692 --> 00:41:48.841
That's why Angel
don't even wanna talk


1012
00:41:48.865 --> 00:41:50.177
to your lame ass, bro.

1013
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:52.904
Marcus Houston ass lookin',
Mr. Rat Burn lookin' ass.


1014
00:41:52.938 --> 00:41:55.216
Aight, aight, aight.

1015
00:41:55.872 --> 00:41:57.011
What was you sayin' bro?

1016
00:41:57.046 --> 00:41:58.012
The reason this party fittin'

1017
00:41:58.047 --> 00:41:59.738
to be bustin' bro is 'cause you

1018
00:41:59.773 --> 00:42:01.222
and Tez got into it yesterday

1019
00:42:01.257 --> 00:42:03.397
and today he end up dead

1020
00:42:03.431 --> 00:42:05.917
and his homie's dead, too, so

1021
00:42:05.951 --> 00:42:07.401
everybody think you killed him.

1022
00:42:07.435 --> 00:42:08.506
What?
Yeah.


1023
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.853
You a hero.

1024
00:42:10.887 --> 00:42:13.234
Everybody hated Tez, everybody.

1025
00:42:13.269 --> 00:42:15.443
Angel is definitely
fittin' to feed


1026
00:42:15.478 --> 00:42:17.066
you some tonight.

1027
00:42:18.585 --> 00:42:19.665
Tez was straight B,
knowing the like,


1028
00:42:19.689 --> 00:42:23.175
she was some type
of man or something.


1029
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.108
But, it ain't even go
down like that, though.


1030
00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:27.904
Listen, I ain't
saying you did it,


1031
00:42:27.939 --> 00:42:30.769
but don't be so quick
to say you didn't.


1032
00:42:30.804 --> 00:42:32.460
You the man right now.

1033
00:42:32.495 --> 00:42:35.049
Ain't nobody gonna try you.

1034
00:42:35.084 --> 00:42:38.915
When I say nobody,
I mean nobody.


1035
00:42:39.916 --> 00:42:42.125
Well, I guess you
right about that then.


1036
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.334
Hey, but you can't
tell nobody, though.


1037
00:42:45.508 --> 00:42:46.578
I ain't saying nothing.

1038
00:42:46.613 --> 00:42:47.959
I'm taking this to my grave

1039
00:42:47.993 --> 00:42:51.065
on my soul, on my
granddaddy grave.


1040
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.963
Aight.

1041
00:42:51.997 --> 00:42:56.105
But for real, this
dude named Jerry.


1042
00:42:56.139 --> 00:42:56.623
Who Jerry?

1043
00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:57.900
He a GD.

1044
00:42:57.934 --> 00:43:00.937
I'm want his girl and
I need you to kill him.


1045
00:43:00.972 --> 00:43:03.388
Ah, shut your ass
up boy, you steady.


1046
00:43:03.422 --> 00:43:07.323
Wow, my homie is going
who wants some more.


1047
00:43:08.773 --> 00:43:10.257
Hey, you finished, bro?

1048
00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:12.224
Yeah, man, you
crispy right now, man.


1049
00:43:12.259 --> 00:43:13.778
Aight, we gotta
run to the store.


1050
00:43:13.812 --> 00:43:15.089
We cop that blunt.

1051
00:43:15.124 --> 00:43:16.608
Yeah, I got you, we need to,

1052
00:43:16.643 --> 00:43:17.827
you know, ride with me anyway,

1053
00:43:17.851 --> 00:43:19.000
'cause we gotta get some smokes,

1054
00:43:19.024 --> 00:43:21.130
some weed, some liquor.

1055
00:43:29.103 --> 00:43:32.037
Oh, hold on,
that's far enough.


1056
00:43:33.142 --> 00:43:35.351
Detective Green from homicide.

1057
00:43:35.385 --> 00:43:36.524
Homicide?

1058
00:43:36.559 --> 00:43:37.905
You at the wrong
house, Mr. Green.


1059
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.011
Have a blessed day.

1060
00:43:40.045 --> 00:43:42.496
Does Jowann Stevens live here?

1061
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.153
Yes, but he just stepped out.

1062
00:43:44.187 --> 00:43:45.982
What do you want
with my grandson?


1063
00:43:46.017 --> 00:43:47.639
Is he in some kind of trouble?

1064
00:43:47.674 --> 00:43:49.330
Well, it seems a
couple of classmates


1065
00:43:49.365 --> 00:43:51.298
got shot and murdered.

1066
00:43:51.332 --> 00:43:52.931
And they say the
witnesses seen him talking


1067
00:43:52.955 --> 00:43:55.785
to one of the boys in
a physical altercation,


1068
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.038
so I'm just here to talk to him

1069
00:43:57.062 --> 00:43:58.374
if that's okay with you.

1070
00:43:58.408 --> 00:43:59.651
Well, now, Mr. Green.

1071
00:43:59.686 --> 00:44:01.308
Detective Green.

1072
00:44:01.342 --> 00:44:03.137
Okay, Detective.

1073
00:44:03.172 --> 00:44:04.311
My grandson might have been

1074
00:44:04.345 --> 00:44:06.313
in some altercation
with one of those boys,


1075
00:44:06.347 --> 00:44:07.797
but he's no killer.

1076
00:44:07.832 --> 00:44:08.981
Well, I can
understand that, ma'am.


1077
00:44:09.005 --> 00:44:09.972
I didn't say he was a killer.

1078
00:44:10.006 --> 00:44:10.835
Maybe he know something

1079
00:44:10.869 --> 00:44:12.008
or maybe he knows somebody.

1080
00:44:12.043 --> 00:44:14.010
I just wanted to talk
to him, that's all.


1081
00:44:14.045 --> 00:44:15.978
If you see him, can
you give him this card,


1082
00:44:16.012 --> 00:44:18.152
tell him to call me?

1083
00:44:18.187 --> 00:44:19.188
Hmm.

1084
00:44:19.844 --> 00:44:20.672
I appreciate it.

1085
00:44:20.707 --> 00:44:22.501
You have a good day, ma'am.

1086
00:44:27.541 --> 00:44:29.577
Who was that?

1087
00:44:29.612 --> 00:44:31.407
That was a homicide detective.

1088
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:32.304
For what?

1089
00:44:32.339 --> 00:44:33.685
For Jowann.

1090
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.687
No matter how hard we try,

1091
00:44:35.722 --> 00:44:37.044
we just can't seem
to keep these boys


1092
00:44:37.068 --> 00:44:39.001
out the streets
and out of trouble.


1093
00:44:39.035 --> 00:44:40.071
Where are we going wrong?

1094
00:44:40.105 --> 00:44:42.176
It's not us, it's
bigger than us.


1095
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:44.006
All I want my family to do

1096
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.905
is the right thing and to
make something of themselves,


1097
00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.011
but it don't seem
to work like that.


1098
00:44:49.045 --> 00:44:51.945
The devil is always busy.

1099
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.394
God help us.

1100
00:44:53.429 --> 00:44:55.017
Hattie, calm yourself.

1101
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:57.916
Getting worked up ain't
gonna change nothing.


1102
00:44:57.951 --> 00:44:59.642
It's bigger than us.

1103
00:45:09.065 --> 00:45:12.517
With my parents
out of the picture,


1104
00:45:12.551 --> 00:45:16.590
my dad in jail and my
mom just straight crazy,


1105
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:19.120
some would say I was headed

1106
00:45:19.144 --> 00:45:21.595
the same direction as them.

1107
00:45:23.631 --> 00:45:26.427
But I always had
my grandparents.


1108
00:45:28.602 --> 00:45:31.501
My grandparents kept
me clean and straight.


1109
00:45:33.089 --> 00:45:34.677
So I gotta make it.

1110
00:45:36.265 --> 00:45:37.576
Just so I could repay them.

1111
00:46:08.918 --> 00:46:11.576
Yeah, she still digs it.

1112
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.648
We damn near even now,
we can do business.


1113
00:46:14.682 --> 00:46:15.649
Look.

1114
00:46:15.683 --> 00:46:17.271
I just need a little bit,

1115
00:46:17.306 --> 00:46:19.446
just to hold me off for a while.

1116
00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.069
'Cause I need more
than just for today.


1117
00:46:22.104 --> 00:46:24.658
You wanna plan on
seeing me every day, mm?


1118
00:46:24.692 --> 00:46:26.936
I need some for
my friends, too,


1119
00:46:26.971 --> 00:46:28.973
we be all wanna do it together.

1120
00:46:29.007 --> 00:46:30.250
What friends?

1121
00:46:30.284 --> 00:46:31.917
You having a party,
you ain't even invited me,


1122
00:46:31.941 --> 00:46:33.771
yet you want me
to front you some?


1123
00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:35.255
You wild then, ain't you Deb.

1124
00:46:35.289 --> 00:46:38.292
Look, I don't need
you to front me shit.


1125
00:46:38.327 --> 00:46:38.948
I got money.

1126
00:46:38.983 --> 00:46:40.191
I'm just trying to pay you

1127
00:46:40.225 --> 00:46:44.298
what I owe you so we can
get this shit over with.


1128
00:46:44.333 --> 00:46:47.025
I see you, Deb, I see you.

1129
00:46:48.233 --> 00:46:50.166
With the brown sugar.

1130
00:46:51.685 --> 00:46:53.825
Brown sugar, huh?

1131
00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.344
Brown sugar daddy.

1132
00:46:57.001 --> 00:46:58.416
Stay right there.

1133
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:08.184
You know the mayor says

1134
00:47:08.219 --> 00:47:12.050
that Chicago has tripled
the murders this year.


1135
00:47:12.085 --> 00:47:13.155
And Chicago has double

1136
00:47:13.189 --> 00:47:15.743
the murders of New
York, Los Angeles


1137
00:47:15.778 --> 00:47:18.505
and Memphis combined this year.

1138
00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:21.163
Mm-hmm, I heard that
on TV this morning.


1139
00:47:21.197 --> 00:47:22.958
There was this girl
on there talking


1140
00:47:22.992 --> 00:47:23.959
to the anchor.

1141
00:47:23.993 --> 00:47:25.995
She sound so ignorant.

1142
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.032
Why don't we take
education more serious?


1143
00:47:28.066 --> 00:47:31.000
We haven't had a good mayor
since Harold Washington.


1144
00:47:31.035 --> 00:47:32.174
What she should have said

1145
00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:35.004
is there is a war on poor folks.

1146
00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:36.085
Well, at least this mayor

1147
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:37.869
has taken some sort of action.

1148
00:47:37.904 --> 00:47:39.008
Something needs to be done

1149
00:47:39.043 --> 00:47:40.261
with these kids
killing each other.


1150
00:47:40.285 --> 00:47:42.909
The mayor can't
change it, nobody can.


1151
00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:44.186
This the way it's gonna be

1152
00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.566
when you oppress a people

1153
00:47:45.601 --> 00:47:48.190
the moment they exist
in this country.


1154
00:47:48.224 --> 00:47:49.260
It's gonna backfire.

1155
00:47:49.294 --> 00:47:51.365
And it's nothing
nobody can do about it,


1156
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.574
except keep tally
until it's over.


1157
00:47:53.609 --> 00:47:54.921
Cedric, don't say that.

1158
00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:55.991
We can pray.

1159
00:47:56.025 --> 00:47:57.716
Don't be so naive.

1160
00:47:57.751 --> 00:48:00.064
If you had a dog, a puppy,

1161
00:48:00.098 --> 00:48:03.032
and you put that
puppy in a little cage


1162
00:48:03.067 --> 00:48:04.033
and you leave it there until

1163
00:48:04.068 --> 00:48:06.242
it grows up into a big dog

1164
00:48:06.277 --> 00:48:08.935
and you open up the cage door,

1165
00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:11.213
what do you think that
dog's gonna do, huh?


1166
00:48:11.247 --> 00:48:13.905
He's gonna come out
that cage a misfit


1167
00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.089
and that's exactly what happened

1168
00:48:15.113 --> 00:48:16.287
to black folks in America

1169
00:48:16.321 --> 00:48:20.567
after being caged for
hundreds of years, misfit.


1170
00:48:25.848 --> 00:48:27.160
Yeah, hey, uh.

1171
00:48:28.471 --> 00:48:29.783
You're welcome.

1172
00:48:35.962 --> 00:48:38.033
Bro, what are you
doing right now, bro.


1173
00:48:38.067 --> 00:48:39.079
Why are you playing a game?

1174
00:48:39.103 --> 00:48:40.114
I know you see Angel
over there, bro.


1175
00:48:40.138 --> 00:48:41.450
Yeah, I see her, bro.

1176
00:48:41.484 --> 00:48:43.590
So you see her, but why
you ain't next to her, bro?


1177
00:48:43.624 --> 00:48:45.085
Are you trippin' on some
liquor or somethin'.


1178
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:46.431
Say what you want to do,
'cause what you do say,


1179
00:48:46.455 --> 00:48:48.975
what the juice say 'cause
you trippin', you buggin'.


1180
00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:49.941
You cappin' right now.

1181
00:48:49.976 --> 00:48:50.977
No, you cappin', bro.

1182
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:52.171
Hey, bro, you see I'm tryna-

1183
00:48:53.841 --> 00:48:56.568
Take it easy, take it easy.

1184
00:48:56.603 --> 00:48:58.950
Y'all always late.

1185
00:48:58.985 --> 00:49:00.089
You guys late.

1186
00:49:00.124 --> 00:49:01.953
You stop, you stop, you stop.

1187
00:49:01.988 --> 00:49:02.954
This party dead.

1188
00:49:02.989 --> 00:49:04.922
It's fucked.

1189
00:49:04.956 --> 00:49:05.923
What's going on.

1190
00:49:05.957 --> 00:49:06.924
Why you so disrespectful?

1191
00:49:06.958 --> 00:49:08.684
The party, the
party must begin.


1192
00:49:08.718 --> 00:49:10.110
Let me see the cup,
thank you, thank you.


1193
00:49:10.134 --> 00:49:11.066
Yeah, y'all go get
something to drink, bro.


1194
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.274
Y'all get outta here.

1195
00:49:12.308 --> 00:49:13.837
Get out, you'll be fine
or I'll kick you out.


1196
00:49:13.861 --> 00:49:14.828
Hey, get me one, too.

1197
00:49:14.862 --> 00:49:16.142
No, you, what
you need to go do


1198
00:49:16.174 --> 00:49:17.796
is go talk to Angel.

1199
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:18.970
That's what you need to do.

1200
00:49:19.005 --> 00:49:20.465
All right, brother,
let me finish this game.


1201
00:49:20.489 --> 00:49:21.776
You think we
should even be here?


1202
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.940
I mean, it's a lot of guys.

1203
00:49:22.974 --> 00:49:23.975
No, we're good.

1204
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.183
Plus Jowann's here.

1205
00:49:25.218 --> 00:49:26.495
He'll make sure we're safe.

1206
00:49:26.529 --> 00:49:28.186
Bro, what are you
doing right now?


1207
00:49:28.221 --> 00:49:30.119
You don't see Angel over there?

1208
00:49:30.154 --> 00:49:31.189
You're not thinking

1209
00:49:31.224 --> 00:49:33.467
about doing anything
with him, are you?


1210
00:49:33.502 --> 00:49:34.502
Maybe.

1211
00:49:35.366 --> 00:49:36.781
Like what's your problem,

1212
00:49:36.815 --> 00:49:37.609
like why you not over there?

1213
00:49:37.644 --> 00:49:38.862
What you talkin'
about right now?


1214
00:49:38.886 --> 00:49:40.105
What you mean what
I'm talkin' about, bro.


1215
00:49:40.129 --> 00:49:41.889
This is on purpose, you
ain't talking to her.


1216
00:49:41.924 --> 00:49:42.960
You playing a game.

1217
00:49:42.994 --> 00:49:43.822
What's your problem.

1218
00:49:43.857 --> 00:49:45.134
Ain't nobody even here yet.

1219
00:49:45.169 --> 00:49:48.689
Girl, didn't your man
just get shot the other day?


1220
00:49:50.346 --> 00:49:52.003
Everybody think
you a man right now.


1221
00:49:52.038 --> 00:49:53.222
You supposed to take advantage

1222
00:49:53.246 --> 00:49:57.008
having her in my mama
room doing the thang.


1223
00:49:57.043 --> 00:49:58.009
Your mama room?

1224
00:49:58.044 --> 00:49:58.837
Yes, in my mama room.

1225
00:49:58.872 --> 00:50:00.011
You bogus.

1226
00:50:00.046 --> 00:50:02.151
No, you bogus for
not taking advantage.


1227
00:50:02.186 --> 00:50:04.671
Listen, man to man,
put the game away


1228
00:50:04.705 --> 00:50:05.924
and go findin'
your business, bro.


1229
00:50:05.948 --> 00:50:07.028
All right.
You trippin'.


1230
00:50:07.053 --> 00:50:10.539
You still got the,
go do what you do.


1231
00:50:13.887 --> 00:50:15.026
Hey, Angel, how you doing?

1232
00:50:15.061 --> 00:50:16.072
Hey, Jowann.
How you doing?


1233
00:50:16.096 --> 00:50:17.201
Good.

1234
00:50:17.235 --> 00:50:20.204
Angel, I could talk
to you real quick?


1235
00:50:21.067 --> 00:50:21.895
Yes.

1236
00:50:21.929 --> 00:50:22.723
Come on.

1237
00:50:22.758 --> 00:50:24.277
All right, cool.

1238
00:50:26.072 --> 00:50:27.901
Wassup, how you doing?

1239
00:50:27.935 --> 00:50:29.040
I'm doing good.

1240
00:50:29.075 --> 00:50:31.698
You lookin' good,
what you Puerto Rican?


1241
00:50:31.732 --> 00:50:32.595
What you tryna do?

1242
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.563
You tryna get a
drink and some weed?


1243
00:50:34.597 --> 00:50:35.460
You smoke?

1244
00:50:35.495 --> 00:50:36.955
Yeah, let's smoke,
I need something.


1245
00:50:36.979 --> 00:50:38.463
I got you, girl.

1246
00:50:41.708 --> 00:50:43.089
You a virgin?

1247
00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:45.884
Nah, girl, I ain't no virgin.

1248
00:50:45.919 --> 00:50:47.058
Wanna know how I feel?

1249
00:50:47.093 --> 00:50:48.439
Yeah.

1250
00:50:50.924 --> 00:50:51.994
Just relax.

1251
00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:14.153
Jowann!

1252
00:51:15.431 --> 00:51:16.984
Did you just come in me?

1253
00:51:17.019 --> 00:51:18.986
Nah, I don't think so.

1254
00:51:19.021 --> 00:51:20.091
What?

1255
00:51:20.126 --> 00:51:21.368
That's my bad.

1256
00:51:21.403 --> 00:51:22.369
No, that's not cool.

1257
00:51:22.404 --> 00:51:23.957
I, I.

1258
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.960
You better be lucky
my sister got a Plan B.


1259
00:51:26.994 --> 00:51:28.617
That's good news.

1260
00:51:29.273 --> 00:51:30.998
Whatever,
I'll catch you later.


1261
00:51:31.033 --> 00:51:33.449
I'll catch you up in there.

1262
00:51:36.003 --> 00:51:37.003
Ooh.

1263
00:51:39.248 --> 00:51:40.939
That was good.

1264
00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:01.339
I'm good.

1265
00:52:03.962 --> 00:52:05.792
Look, I ain't come
all the way over here


1266
00:52:05.826 --> 00:52:08.967
for you to be all on scrolling
on Facebook and shit.


1267
00:52:09.002 --> 00:52:10.152
Is you gonna serve me or not?

1268
00:52:10.176 --> 00:52:12.143
I'm a paying customer.

1269
00:52:12.178 --> 00:52:14.456
No show Mr. Brody.

1270
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.354
Remember that one?

1271
00:52:16.389 --> 00:52:17.849
Used to come through,
get a good head,


1272
00:52:17.873 --> 00:52:18.598

00:52:18.632 --> 00:52:19.978
and now she got a little bread.

1275
00:52:22.015 --> 00:52:23.154
That's how you feel?

1276
00:52:23.189 --> 00:52:24.811

1279
00:52:30.023 --> 00:52:31.783

1280
00:52:31.818 --> 00:52:33.509
Jowann, my son, Jowann?

1281
00:52:33.544 --> 00:52:35.166
So y'all niggas dumb as hell.

Don't y'all got some shit to do?

00:52:39.653 --> 00:52:40.653
Huh?

What the fuck is y'all on now.

1287
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:46.350
Ain't nobody talkin'

1288
00:52:46.384 --> 00:52:50.043
It's a whole nother Jowann,
somewhere from over here.


1289
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:57.188
That's that gas.

1290
00:52:57.223 --> 00:52:58.431
Try that out.

1291
00:52:59.225 --> 00:53:01.503
I'm a calculate it.

1292
00:53:01.537 --> 00:53:03.367
Take your time
with that, though.


1293
00:53:03.401 --> 00:53:06.024
You hittin' it like it's a pipe.

1294
00:53:11.064 --> 00:53:13.515
It's still too hot for you.

1295
00:53:33.638 --> 00:53:36.227
Come on, I need the hit.

1296
00:53:36.262 --> 00:53:37.539
Take him.

1297
00:53:37.573 --> 00:53:39.610
You could do what you wanna do.

1298
00:53:39.644 --> 00:53:42.129
Take him, I don't want him.

1299
00:53:42.164 --> 00:53:43.234
I don't want him.

1300
00:53:43.269 --> 00:53:45.512
Do what you wanna do.

1301
00:53:45.547 --> 00:53:47.238
I heard about you.

1302
00:53:47.273 --> 00:53:48.929
Them little boys.

1303
00:53:50.103 --> 00:53:51.104
Come on.

1304
00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:54.418
Look at me, I'm clean now.

1305
00:53:55.246 --> 00:53:57.455
Son, don't look like that.

1306
00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:59.595
Give me another chance.

1307
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:02.011
This Bianca.

1308
00:54:02.667 --> 00:54:06.464
Son, don't look like
that, give us a chance.


1309
00:54:06.499 --> 00:54:08.984
We can all be one
big happy family.


1310
00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:12.263
Outback, outback,
what's good with you boy.


1311
00:54:12.298 --> 00:54:14.265
Brother, let me
hold something.


1312
00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.094
Let me hold something.

1313
00:54:16.129 --> 00:54:17.924
Let me hold something.

1314
00:54:17.958 --> 00:54:19.788
Let me hold something.

1315
00:54:20.409 --> 00:54:22.791
See, you can't get no
chick like this, man.


1316
00:54:22.825 --> 00:54:25.276
Studying and
getting good grades.


1317
00:54:25.311 --> 00:54:27.071
You gotta get that paper, man.

1318
00:54:27.105 --> 00:54:28.797
You gotta get it now.

1319
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:30.695
Don't wait till
that diploma come.


1320
00:54:38.703 --> 00:54:41.188
You know why it happened.

1321
00:54:44.468 --> 00:54:46.332
'Cause you ain't game.

1322
00:55:55.228 --> 00:55:56.228
Granny!

1323
00:55:59.922 --> 00:56:00.922
Granny.

1324
00:56:08.759 --> 00:56:11.831
Hey,
Jowann, this your boss, Grady.


1325
00:56:11.865 --> 00:56:14.212
I got you on security
camera throwing


1326
00:56:14.247 --> 00:56:16.525
them shoes in the garbage can

1327
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.700
and taking the bag with you.

1328
00:56:18.734 --> 00:56:21.219
You're fired and
bring them shoes back


1329
00:56:21.254 --> 00:56:23.118
or I'm calling the cops.

1330
00:56:23.152 --> 00:56:25.534
Jowann, it's your granddad.

1331
00:56:25.569 --> 00:56:27.398
Boy, what's the sense
of having a phone


1332
00:56:27.433 --> 00:56:29.780
if you won't answer?

1333
00:56:29.814 --> 00:56:31.437
Your grandmother
fell on the stairs


1334
00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:32.783
and hit her head.

1335
00:56:32.817 --> 00:56:34.509
She hasn't woke up since.

1336
00:56:34.543 --> 00:56:35.958
We at the hospital.

1337
00:56:35.993 --> 00:56:37.650
Room 2209.

1338
00:56:38.236 --> 00:56:40.618
Hurry up and get up here now.

1339
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.590
Man, come on, God.

1340
00:56:48.143 --> 00:56:49.627
Jacob, now Granny.

1341
00:56:50.628 --> 00:56:53.251
Ugh.

1342
00:56:56.116 --> 00:56:57.152
Granny.

1343
00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:07.231
Thank you for your interest
in Morehouse College.


1344
00:57:07.265 --> 00:57:08.922
Sorry to inform you.

1345
00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.340
Wait.

1346
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:18.794
Who qualify for the
pre-freshman program,


1347
00:57:19.485 --> 00:57:21.383
college credit in July.

1348
00:57:22.384 --> 00:57:25.939
Cover letter and a $1,000
check money order deposit.


1349
00:57:38.538 --> 00:57:39.746
Hey, what's up, buddy?

1350
00:57:39.781 --> 00:57:41.645
What's going on with you?
Hey.


1351
00:57:41.679 --> 00:57:42.473
Who is y'all.

1352
00:57:42.508 --> 00:57:43.509
Hey, man.

1353
00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:44.543
Hey.

1354
00:58:01.527 --> 00:58:03.632
Did you kill those boys?

1355
00:58:03.667 --> 00:58:05.979
Look, it wasn't me.

1356
00:58:06.014 --> 00:58:08.465
You gonna make this
hard on yourself, man.


1357
00:58:08.499 --> 00:58:09.707
Did you kill those boys?

1358
00:58:09.742 --> 00:58:11.813
I said it wasn't me.

1359
00:58:19.683 --> 00:58:22.030
I don't think
you understand me.


1360
00:58:22.064 --> 00:58:25.171
I could put you away
for a very long time.


1361
00:58:25.205 --> 00:58:26.068
Hey, man, what up man.

1362
00:58:26.103 --> 00:58:27.656
Hey, man, see you
out here shining.


1363
00:58:27.691 --> 00:58:29.013
Hey, man, you know
what's going on, man.


1364
00:58:29.037 --> 00:58:31.039
I know Ty Lord
don't put us down.


1365
00:58:31.073 --> 00:58:32.040
Oh, what?

1366
00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:33.697
That's why he
sent me out here.


1367
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:35.768
He told me I was, hey.

1368
00:58:38.564 --> 00:58:40.358
Look, even if I did tell you,

1369
00:58:40.393 --> 00:58:41.428
I'm as good as dead.

1370
00:58:41.463 --> 00:58:42.844
But I can help you.

1371
00:58:42.878 --> 00:58:44.362
If you help lead
me to the killer,


1372
00:58:44.397 --> 00:58:46.019
I can get you out of school

1373
00:58:46.054 --> 00:58:48.643
for a few weeks, stay
away for a while.


1374
00:58:48.677 --> 00:58:50.068
I'm a keep you under
the radar, man.


1375
00:58:50.092 --> 00:58:53.544
But only if you help us.

1376
00:58:53.579 --> 00:58:55.028
Ain't that shorty right there.

1377
00:58:55.063 --> 00:58:55.995
Over there.

1378
00:58:56.029 --> 00:58:57.928
Looks like Jowann
trying get tenor, G.


1379
00:58:57.962 --> 00:58:58.860
Is that Jowann?

1380
00:58:58.894 --> 00:58:59.895
Hell, yeah, hey, look

1381
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:00.896
that nigga singin', too.

1382
00:59:00.931 --> 00:59:03.416
That dude over there.

1383
00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:04.244
Hey, call Ty Lord.

1384
00:59:04.279 --> 00:59:05.522
Make that phone call, G.

1385
00:59:05.556 --> 00:59:07.420
You gotta go, though.
Make that call, bro.


1386
00:59:07.454 --> 00:59:08.904
I knew it was y'all.

1387
00:59:08.939 --> 00:59:11.424
Yeah, yeah, this
nigga out here


1388
00:59:11.458 --> 00:59:13.253
with the feds, bro.

1389
00:59:14.565 --> 00:59:16.463
Yeah, right now on the block.

1390
00:59:16.498 --> 00:59:18.234
Look, man, even if I
say anything to y'all,


1391
00:59:18.258 --> 00:59:19.466
I'm as good as dead.

1392
00:59:19.501 --> 00:59:21.710
Then listen to me.

1393
00:59:21.745 --> 00:59:25.611
Ezekiel Green, one of
the kids you killed,


1394
00:59:25.645 --> 00:59:27.164
that was my son,

1395
00:59:28.061 --> 00:59:31.686
so I take this case
very personally,


1396
00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.411
so if you don't help
me find the killer.


1397
00:59:39.279 --> 00:59:40.279
Hello.

1398
00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.768
I got that name for you.

1399
00:59:45.458 --> 00:59:47.943
Man, get him out the car.

1400
00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:55.468
Come on, man.

1401
01:00:10.863 --> 01:00:14.314
Look, Granny,
I'm sorry, this all my fault.


1402
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:17.455
But you the only one
that's keeping me going.


1403
01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.665
And I didn't get into Morehouse,

1404
01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.011
but they got this summer program

1405
01:00:21.045 --> 01:00:22.495
that'll give me the opportunity

1406
01:00:22.529 --> 01:00:24.324
to earn my way in,

1407
01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:27.776
but all the money I saved
for Fleet Club is gone


1408
01:00:27.811 --> 01:00:30.158
and I know Debbie took it.

1409
01:00:40.824 --> 01:00:42.204
Yo, hey, yo!

1410
01:00:43.343 --> 01:00:44.862
Where my money go?

1411
01:00:44.897 --> 01:00:46.312
Don't talk to me like that.

1412
01:00:46.346 --> 01:00:47.382
I'm your mother.
Hey.


1413
01:00:47.416 --> 01:00:48.877
Granny and Granddad
are at the hospital,


1414
01:00:48.901 --> 01:00:50.316
'cause Granny
ain't feeling well.


1415
01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:51.213
It's not my-

1416
01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:52.397
You shouldn't even be here.

1417
01:00:52.421 --> 01:00:53.675
It's not my fault
she not feeling well.


1418
01:00:53.699 --> 01:00:55.193
She the one wanna
keep cooking soul food


1419
01:00:55.217 --> 01:00:58.704
and making baked pies
and cakes and shit.


1420
01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:01.327
Listen, help me find
out where the money at.


1421
01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:02.639
I'll split it with you.

1422
01:01:02.673 --> 01:01:03.812
What?

1423
01:01:03.847 --> 01:01:05.711
Are you that dumb?

1424
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.067
Has the crack and
heroin really tried


1425
01:01:07.091 --> 01:01:10.025
your brain to the point
you stealing from your son?


1426
01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.820
Look, I never stole
nothing from you.


1427
01:01:11.855 --> 01:01:12.970
I'm the reason you even here.

1428
01:01:12.994 --> 01:01:14.996
I was in labor 12 hours pushing

1429
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.170
out that big ass head of yours.

1430
01:01:17.205 --> 01:01:18.827
I hate you!

1431
01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:21.002
I wish you never even existed.

1432
01:01:21.036 --> 01:01:22.382
Everything that's wrong with me

1433
01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:24.108
is because of you.

1434
01:01:26.041 --> 01:01:29.907
Look, son, I know I
wasn't a good mother.


1435
01:01:29.942 --> 01:01:31.426
I know I was a bad mother,

1436
01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.014
but it's a lot going on.

1437
01:01:33.048 --> 01:01:35.188
I'm hearing things
in these streets.


1438
01:01:35.223 --> 01:01:37.018
What you hearing? From who?

1439
01:01:37.052 --> 01:01:39.365
Tyler. Yeah, Tyler.

1440
01:01:39.399 --> 01:01:43.438
He looking for you and
guess what, he got guns.


1441
01:01:44.059 --> 01:01:45.716
Look, I'm leaving
and I'm taking Granny


1442
01:01:45.751 --> 01:01:46.855
and Granddad with me, man,

1443
01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:47.856
so they can get away from all

1444
01:01:47.891 --> 01:01:50.065
this bullshit, especially you.

1445
01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.515
Granny, Granny, what about me?

1446
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:52.999
I'm your mother.

1447
01:01:53.034 --> 01:01:54.863
You are 40 years old.

1448
01:01:54.898 --> 01:01:57.555
Granny already took care
of your responsibility,


1449
01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:58.591
which is me.

1450
01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.594
You sorry, man.

1451
01:02:29.967 --> 01:02:33.108
Somebody told me
you sang, nigga.


1452
01:02:40.978 --> 01:02:43.325
Clear.
Clear.


1453
01:02:45.293 --> 01:02:48.330
My family always
fucked with me.


1454
01:02:50.954 --> 01:02:51.920
But you ain't gonna be the one

1455
01:02:51.955 --> 01:02:54.336
that's gonna fuck me over.

1456
01:02:55.821 --> 01:02:56.960
What you talking about?

1457
01:02:56.994 --> 01:02:59.514
What the fuck you
say to the feds, man?


1458
01:03:01.033 --> 01:03:02.344
Hey, hey.

1459
01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:03.379
Hmm?

1460
01:03:04.139 --> 01:03:06.107
Hey, they pulled me, man.

1461
01:03:06.141 --> 01:03:07.142
Hey, they came to me.

1462
01:03:07.177 --> 01:03:09.317
Hey, come on, man, hey.

1463
01:03:11.215 --> 01:03:15.185
You don't even gotta
do that man, for real.


1464
01:03:22.571 --> 01:03:25.643
I've done did some shit
that I didn't wanna do,


1465
01:03:26.058 --> 01:03:27.818
but there's some shit
that I gotta know.


1466
01:03:27.853 --> 01:03:30.510
You ain't fuckin' with me, bro.

1467
01:03:30.545 --> 01:03:33.030
Hey, I ain't tell them
nothin', man, I swear.


1468
01:03:33.065 --> 01:03:34.100
I put that on everything.

1469
01:03:34.135 --> 01:03:35.999
I ain't say nothing to them.

1470
01:03:39.036 --> 01:03:41.142
The fuck was that?

1471
01:03:46.492 --> 01:03:48.183
I'll be right back.

1472
01:03:50.392 --> 01:03:51.392
Don't move.

1473
01:03:53.533 --> 01:03:55.742
And if you not here
when I get back


1474
01:03:55.777 --> 01:03:57.710
and I have to find you,

1475
01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.058
I'm a kill you, okay.

1476
01:04:07.547 --> 01:04:09.860
Who the fuck is in here?

1477
01:04:09.895 --> 01:04:10.895
Huh?

1478
01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:13.864
Where the fuck are you at

1479
01:04:13.899 --> 01:04:17.040
and what the fuck
do you want, huh?


1480
01:04:18.282 --> 01:04:19.322
'Cause all I got is smoke.

1481
01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.976
Huh?

1482
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:23.011
Where you at?

1483
01:04:24.806 --> 01:04:26.083
Motherfucker.

1484
01:04:38.061 --> 01:04:40.822
Well, well,
well, Tyler Wilcox.


1485
01:04:41.892 --> 01:04:44.343
You know what I'm
here for, right?


1486
01:04:44.377 --> 01:04:46.586
About them boys in the alley.

1487
01:04:47.725 --> 01:04:50.038
Go ahead, lock me up.

1488
01:04:50.073 --> 01:04:52.351
My lawyer a beast, I'll
be out in the morning.


1489
01:04:52.385 --> 01:04:54.698
Nah, this ain't
that type of deal.


1490
01:04:54.732 --> 01:04:55.778
This ain't got nothing to do

1491
01:04:55.802 --> 01:04:57.183
with the boys in blue.

1492
01:04:57.218 --> 01:04:59.945
This one right here,
this is personal.


1493
01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:02.464
I don't know what you heard,

1494
01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:06.296
but one of them kids
you killed was my son.


1495
01:05:08.436 --> 01:05:11.853
Both of y'all got
the game fucked up.


1496
01:05:13.786 --> 01:05:15.926
Fuck you and you son.

1497
01:05:15.961 --> 01:05:17.410
I thought you would say that.

1498
01:05:36.636 --> 01:05:37.948
Shit.

1499
01:05:37.983 --> 01:05:38.949
Yo.

1500
01:05:38.984 --> 01:05:40.157
We gotta go.

1501
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.677
We gotta go, now.

1502
01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:45.887
Green, let's go.

1503
01:06:21.129 --> 01:06:22.027
Who is this?

1504
01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.994
My friend, Frank.

1505
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:26.859
Come and give me a hug first.

1506
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.979
When he leave, come
and get your gift.


1507
01:06:43.013 --> 01:06:45.119
My birthday passed already.

1508
01:06:45.153 --> 01:06:47.190
It's a early gift.

1509
01:06:51.366 --> 01:06:53.748
Hey, who's buddy,
he weird as hell.


1510
01:06:53.782 --> 01:06:54.611
My stepdad.

1511
01:06:54.645 --> 01:06:57.200
Shit, that wasn't
not stepdad hug.


1512
01:06:57.234 --> 01:07:00.306
Look, my family
ain't perfect, okay.


1513
01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:02.032
You judging me now?
No.


1514
01:07:02.067 --> 01:07:03.033
I only brought you here

1515
01:07:03.068 --> 01:07:05.311
because they were
gonna kill you.


1516
01:07:05.346 --> 01:07:07.037
Look, I appreciate that,

1517
01:07:07.072 --> 01:07:08.901
but I don't need you
watching over me,


1518
01:07:08.935 --> 01:07:10.040
protecting me, man.

1519
01:07:10.075 --> 01:07:12.042
I'm cool, I got myself.

1520
01:07:12.077 --> 01:07:13.157
After you left the party,

1521
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:14.365
Tyler and his friends came in,

1522
01:07:14.389 --> 01:07:16.150
they got drunk and
they were talking


1523
01:07:16.184 --> 01:07:18.255
about how you're
gonna turn up dead.


1524
01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:20.199
See, man, this shouldn't
even went down like that


1525
01:07:20.223 --> 01:07:21.155
'cause I ain't tell nobody.

1526
01:07:21.189 --> 01:07:23.364
Like I didn't tell a soul.

1527
01:07:23.398 --> 01:07:25.538
Tell what, what are
you talking about?


1528
01:07:25.573 --> 01:07:28.058
Long story short,
your boy Tez,


1529
01:07:28.093 --> 01:07:30.095
your prom date,
I saw Ty Lord kill him


1530
01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:32.062
and his homies.

1531
01:07:32.097 --> 01:07:33.063
He said he was gonna kill me

1532
01:07:33.098 --> 01:07:34.961
if I told anybody, so.

1533
01:07:34.996 --> 01:07:36.180
Dang, you know
everybody thought


1534
01:07:36.204 --> 01:07:37.378
you killed Tez?

1535
01:07:37.412 --> 01:07:38.551
So I guess you had no choice

1536
01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:39.449
but to snitch.

1537
01:07:39.483 --> 01:07:41.382
Look, I wouldn't
snitch regardless,


1538
01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:43.049
but the cops said they
was gonna put it on me


1539
01:07:43.073 --> 01:07:45.041
if I didn't say nothing.

1540
01:07:45.075 --> 01:07:47.112
So you told and
I don't blame you.


1541
01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.423
It's too many fools out here

1542
01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:50.529
who in jail for something
they did not do.


1543
01:07:50.563 --> 01:07:51.806
My cousin in jail for 30 years

1544
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.428
for something he didn't do.

1545
01:07:53.463 --> 01:07:55.534
So basically you
didn't say anything,


1546
01:07:55.568 --> 01:07:56.983
but the whole hood
looking at you


1547
01:07:57.018 --> 01:07:58.192
like you a snitch.

1548
01:07:58.226 --> 01:08:00.194
So you might as well did tell.

1549
01:08:00.228 --> 01:08:01.436
Basically.

1550
01:08:02.092 --> 01:08:04.060
So that's why
they want you dead?


1551
01:08:04.094 --> 01:08:06.062
That's so lame.

1552
01:08:06.096 --> 01:08:07.487
I hope Tyler done
learned his lesson.


1553
01:08:07.511 --> 01:08:09.237
He always after somebody.

1554
01:08:09.272 --> 01:08:10.135
It's only a matter of time

1555
01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:12.482
before they catch up with you.

1556
01:08:14.587 --> 01:08:16.117
Look, I gotta get
outta there tonight.


1557
01:08:16.141 --> 01:08:17.107
The only reason why I'm here

1558
01:08:17.142 --> 01:08:18.971
is because Granny in a coma.

1559
01:08:19.004 --> 01:08:20.316
And go where?

1560
01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:22.387
Look, I'm going to Atlanta.

1561
01:08:22.423 --> 01:08:24.563
I applied to a couple
of colleges down there.


1562
01:08:24.597 --> 01:08:26.392
Morehouse is one of them.

1563
01:08:26.427 --> 01:08:27.635
CAU was another one.

1564
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:29.119
I mean, I ain't get accepted,

1565
01:08:29.154 --> 01:08:32.743
but, hey, they got this
summer program, though.


1566
01:08:32.778 --> 01:08:34.020
Where you going?

1567
01:08:34.055 --> 01:08:35.953
Are you serious?

1568
01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:37.333
What's that?

1569
01:08:40.199 --> 01:08:41.441
What's this?

1570
01:08:44.686 --> 01:08:45.687
Oh.

1571
01:08:45.722 --> 01:08:47.343
You got accepted?

1572
01:08:48.276 --> 01:08:49.622
Man, that's huge.

1573
01:08:49.656 --> 01:08:51.451
I mean, I ain't get accepted,

1574
01:08:51.485 --> 01:08:53.798
but man, congratulations.

1575
01:08:55.007 --> 01:08:56.628
I mean, it feels good

1576
01:08:56.664 --> 01:08:59.529
to know that I'm smart
enough to get into college,


1577
01:08:59.563 --> 01:09:02.013
but I'm not gonna actually go.

1578
01:09:02.048 --> 01:09:03.429
You know, what's the point?

1579
01:09:03.464 --> 01:09:04.948
I know people with good degrees

1580
01:09:04.982 --> 01:09:05.949
and no jobs.

1581
01:09:05.983 --> 01:09:07.295
I know a man who moving weight

1582
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.985
with a master's degree.

1583
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:10.821
I mean, I much rather
take my chances trying


1584
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:11.989
to get a degree

1585
01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:14.475
then spend another
summer here in Chicago.


1586
01:09:14.509 --> 01:09:15.555
But you don't understand.

1587
01:09:15.579 --> 01:09:17.616
I never left the Chicago area.

1588
01:09:17.650 --> 01:09:20.583
I don't know how to act
if I'm somewhere else.


1589
01:09:21.206 --> 01:09:22.966
I done seen five
people get killed


1590
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:23.829
in one weekend.

1591
01:09:23.863 --> 01:09:26.659
I'm outta here,
I can't stay here.


1592
01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:28.361
The last thing Jacob
told me before he died,


1593
01:09:28.385 --> 01:09:31.285
he said he was gonna go with me,

1594
01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:34.701
so that's why I wanted
you to come with me.


1595
01:09:34.735 --> 01:09:37.739
At least I know somebody
if I'm down there.


1596
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.534
You must think I'm a ho

1597
01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:41.467
because what happened at
that party, don't you?


1598
01:09:41.502 --> 01:09:44.125
Well, I'm not, 
I was just tipsy.

1599
01:09:44.884 --> 01:09:46.196
But I do like you.

1600
01:09:46.231 --> 01:09:47.334
I don't think you no ho

1601
01:09:47.369 --> 01:09:49.164
and I know you probably
think I'm a goof


1602
01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:51.650
because I came quick,

1603
01:09:51.683 --> 01:09:53.754
but the truth is
I want you to come


1604
01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:56.862
to Atlanta with me
because I like you, too.


1605
01:09:56.896 --> 01:09:57.896
I can't.

1606
01:09:59.382 --> 01:10:00.521
I mean, you can.

1607
01:10:00.555 --> 01:10:02.523
If anybody can, you
smart and you pretty.


1608
01:10:02.557 --> 01:10:03.833
You can do anything you want.

1609
01:10:03.869 --> 01:10:06.043
If you stay here,
what you gonna do?


1610
01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:08.217
Get pregnant, get a bogus job,

1611
01:10:08.253 --> 01:10:10.876
get Link card, Section 8?

1612
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.153
What's stopping you.

1613
01:10:13.154 --> 01:10:14.949
It's Frank?

1614
01:10:14.983 --> 01:10:16.985
Frank, what about him?

1615
01:10:17.952 --> 01:10:18.780
Ever since my mom died,

1616
01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:21.576
he took care of
me and my sisters.


1617
01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:23.544
You know, even when
mom and him wasn't


1618
01:10:23.578 --> 01:10:26.892
on good terms, he
still took care of me.


1619
01:10:26.926 --> 01:10:29.515
He would want you to
get an education, too.


1620
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:32.104
You don't understand.

1621
01:10:33.001 --> 01:10:34.255
Why would he
try to stop you from doing


1622
01:10:34.279 --> 01:10:37.282
what's right with your life?

1623
01:10:37.315 --> 01:10:38.421
He isn't.

1624
01:10:39.663 --> 01:10:41.596
Then what is it?

1625
01:10:50.398 --> 01:10:51.951
He touches me.

1626
01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:55.438
Ever since I was a little girl.

1627
01:10:56.197 --> 01:10:58.026
I didn't like it then.

1628
01:10:59.199 --> 01:11:00.926
But I like it now.

1629
01:11:03.411 --> 01:11:05.655
He makes me feel special.

1630
01:11:07.414 --> 01:11:11.419
Look, Angel, that's
none of my business,


1631
01:11:11.454 --> 01:11:14.974
but what he doing to
you, that's wrong.


1632
01:11:16.182 --> 01:11:19.185
That's, you don't deserve that.

1633
01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.567
Angel, you still got company?

1634
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:24.121
Yes, Frank, go away.

1635
01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.159
What, stink ass.

1636
01:11:27.193 --> 01:11:29.955
I gotta get outta
town ASAP, man.


1637
01:11:29.989 --> 01:11:31.691
But you got time, so I
want you to think about it.


1638
01:11:31.715 --> 01:11:33.130
I'm a go down there,
around the 7th,


1639
01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:34.476
I'm a be back.

1640
01:11:34.511 --> 01:11:37.030
I'm a let you know everything
you missing, all right?


1641
01:11:37.065 --> 01:11:38.342
Okay, I'll think about it,

1642
01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:42.070
but you know you don't
have to leave, right?


1643
01:11:43.865 --> 01:11:45.326
Get the police to say
excuse me from school


1644
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:48.801
and I'll come meet
you at the Plug Thug.


1645
01:11:48.836 --> 01:11:50.146
I'll make a few calls then,

1646
01:11:50.182 --> 01:11:51.321
I'll pull some strings.

1647
01:11:51.356 --> 01:11:53.427
But for right now, I
gotta get up outta here.


1648
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:55.048
So, all right then.

1649
01:12:18.866 --> 01:12:20.902
First, I was confused.

1650
01:12:21.903 --> 01:12:22.903
Angry.

1651
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:25.769
I was frustrated.

1652
01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:30.636
But then I realized
I can't change


1653
01:12:30.671 --> 01:12:35.538
the people around me
and that's the struggle.


1654
01:12:36.746 --> 01:12:40.715
Do I leave them and
give up on them?


1655
01:12:43.235 --> 01:12:46.894
All I know is that I
have to focus on myself.


1656
01:12:46.928 --> 01:12:51.277
And maybe all this can
change them for the better.


1657
01:12:53.694 --> 01:12:57.249
It's funny how one
weekend can change


1658
01:12:57.283 --> 01:12:59.251
the course of one life.

1659
01:13:00.597 --> 01:13:02.565
But my path is clear.

1660
01:13:03.773 --> 01:13:04.946
It's clearer than ever,

1661
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:09.295
especially since Ty Lord
told me what he told me.


1662
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.782
I'm a pray for Debbie

1663
01:13:12.815 --> 01:13:14.956
and I really hope
she gets better,


1664
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.926
but what's crazy is Angel.

1665
01:13:20.824 --> 01:13:23.240
I thought she was the one.

1666
01:13:24.069 --> 01:13:27.175
But with the whole
Frank situation,


1667
01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.282
I'm a pray for her, too.

1668
01:13:31.766 --> 01:13:36.081
The person I'm really gonna
miss the most is Granny.


1669
01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:40.016
I'm sorry I have to
leave you like this,


1670
01:13:41.119 --> 01:13:41.914
but if I can make it out

1671
01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:44.952
on the west side of Chicago,

1672
01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:47.333
I'd be the only one that I know

1673
01:13:47.368 --> 01:13:49.094
to have done that.

1674
01:13:50.923 --> 01:13:53.305
So it's bye for now, Chicago.

1675
01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:56.377
You will always be home.

1676
01:13:57.792 --> 01:14:00.173
But I gotta keep it moving

1677
01:14:00.967 --> 01:14:03.971
and take my chances in Atlanta.
