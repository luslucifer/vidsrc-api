00:08:50.573 --> 00:08:52.490
Growing up, we faced some tough times.

152
00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:55.323
Had some tough times with the police.

153
00:08:55.907 --> 00:08:58.990
So I want you to know
that I'm not coming here as an outsider.


154
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.490
I'm here

155
00:09:01.032 --> 00:09:02.198
because I'm one of you.

156
00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:05.240
We all want the same thing.

157
00:09:05.323 --> 00:09:07.532
We all want
a safe neighborhood to grow up.


158
00:09:08.032 --> 00:09:13.282
And, um, clearly…
the Guardians were never the answer.


159
00:09:14.782 --> 00:09:16.157
Well, we've listened.

160
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.615
And we've made changes.

161
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.615
But for the fun part. 
Officer Stillman.

162
00:09:21.698 --> 00:09:23.948
Let's get a round of applause
for Officer Stillman


163
00:09:24.032 --> 00:09:25.448

- [applause]
- Best chef in town, isn't he? [chuckles]


165
00:09:29.282 --> 00:09:32.990
Now I want you to see what happens
when a K9 perceives a threat.


166
00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.282
Go ahead and take that Taser out.

167
00:09:36.657 --> 00:09:39.032
- All right. Point it.
- [K9 beeping]


168
00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:42.115
He's worried, but he doesn't need to be.
You got this. [laughs]

Jeez. Mm, that must have hurt.

172
00:09:49.948 --> 00:09:53.115
But these things are only built to detain.

173
00:09:53.198 --> 00:09:54.907
Okay? Never to harm. Never.

174
00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:57.532
If you encounter one of these dogs,

175
00:09:57.615 --> 00:09:59.948
and you're doing something
you probably shouldn't be doing,


176
00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:02.282
there's no need to be afraid. Stillman.

177
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.657
Just put your hands up.

178
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.740
[beeping and whirring]

179

- And the dog will stand down.


180
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.615
So, once more,

181
00:10:10.698 --> 00:10:12.490
if you just put your hands up…

182
00:10:15.032 --> 00:10:16.240
they won't hurt you.

And a round of applause for Piper.

186
00:10:22.698 --> 00:10:25.615
Feel free to come up,
take a few photos with the kids.

It's criminal what they tax us.

00:11:08.865 --> 00:11:11.115
Well, it's the cost of doing business.
Come on.

I gotta figure out where we're going next.

I think…

I think we head to the border.

[Connor] I don't care about me.

01:01:35.198 --> 01:01:36.999
I'll testify,
I'll do whatever time I have to,

01:01:37.073 --> 01:01:38.740
as long as King goes down

and Pav gets
the protection that she needs.

I can't guarantee that.

nobody's going against him.

My former partner
learned that the hard way.

[man] What about them?

891
01:02:31.865 --> 01:02:33.365
They record what happens.

01:02:33.865 --> 01:02:36.698
I could feel it when the dog came at me.
It's how they learn.

[Garrett] Can we get one of them
from the precinct?

But…

896
01:02:43.948 --> 01:02:46.740
King does keep
his personal unit at his house.


897
01:02:46.823 --> 01:02:48.573
Then why don't we just kill him?

898
01:02:48.657 --> 01:02:50.240
Take the dog.

manage to get the dog,

what then?

How do we get out whatever's on it?

Pav can do it.

No.

Just give me something to transfer it to.

I've got it at the Towers.

909

We can do it there.

I can do this.

Are we early?
You're always making us early.

that maybe we could wait inside?

01:06:05.948 --> 01:06:07.032
I appreciate that.

953
01:06:07.698 --> 01:06:09.198
How can I help you guys?

954
01:06:09.282 --> 01:06:12.282
[Garrett] Uh, well, we just wanted
to dig into your campaign.


955
01:06:13.448 --> 01:06:14.782
My campaign.

956
01:06:14.865 --> 01:06:16.365
For union president.

957
01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.282
[chuckles] What do you wanna know?

958
01:06:19.782 --> 01:06:22.157
- [tense music playing]
- [keypad beeps]


959
01:06:34.865 --> 01:06:38.282
[Garrett] Well, you seem to be doing
very well with the powered community.


960
01:06:39.323 --> 01:06:40.782
What's the trick there?

961
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.073
I just try to treat them
like they're people.


962
01:06:44.157 --> 01:06:45.948
Just like you, me.

963
01:06:46.448 --> 01:06:47.740
Just like you and me.

964
01:06:48.365 --> 01:06:49.365
Yeah.

965
01:06:51.032 --> 01:06:53.115
- [beeps, powering up]
- [gasps]


966
01:06:53.198 --> 01:06:54.698
[whirring]

967
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.282
Sergeant.

968
01:07:02.365 --> 01:07:04.573
<i>I just got an alert from your K9.
What's going on?</i>


969
01:07:05.657 --> 01:07:06.490
<i>Are you there?</i>

970
01:07:06.573 --> 01:07:09.073
[wife] He barely got any support
from the department


971
01:07:09.157 --> 01:07:11.032
after he was attacked by that Pyro.

972
01:07:11.115 --> 01:07:12.782
Something had to change.

973
01:07:13.282 --> 01:07:15.198
[Garrett] That's how you got that scar?

974
01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:17.532
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.
- [cell phone buzzing]


975
01:07:20.323 --> 01:07:23.073
[cell phone continues buzzing]

976
01:07:24.532 --> 01:07:27.032
[wife] I keep telling him
he shouldn't hide it,


977
01:07:27.115 --> 01:07:29.115
especially for the campaign.

978
01:07:29.198 --> 01:07:31.032
Officers respect him for it.

979
01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:32.323
Yes, they do.

980
01:07:32.407 --> 01:07:33.532
We certainly do.

981
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.490
[suspenseful music playing]

982
01:07:36.573 --> 01:07:37.740
No answer.

983
01:07:37.823 --> 01:07:38.823
I'll send a unit.

984
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:45.240
[Pavani] Come on, unlock.

985
01:07:47.282 --> 01:07:48.323
Unlock.

986
01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:52.865
[K9 whirring]

987
01:07:52.948 --> 01:07:54.198
[Stillman] Try his house.

988
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.782
[phones ringing]

989
01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.573
That is probably Emily looking for a ride.

990
01:08:00.657 --> 01:08:01.657
Excuse me.

991
01:08:02.032 --> 01:08:03.282
Where's the bathroom?

992
01:08:03.365 --> 01:08:05.258
- [wife] Oh, just over here.
- [Connor] Thank you.


993
01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:07.532
[phones continue ringing]

994
01:08:09.615 --> 01:08:11.056
[officer] <i>Alpha 13, what's your ETA?</i>

995
01:08:11.115 --> 01:08:14.174
[officer 2] <i>Turning down Rosewood now.</i>
<i>Three minutes from the sergeant's house.</i>


996
01:08:14.198 --> 01:08:15.823
Hey, what the hell's going on?

997
01:08:15.907 --> 01:08:19.323
I can't do it. It's not working.
They keep calling him. They're gonna come.


998
01:08:19.407 --> 01:08:22.032
- We'll get caught. We have to leave.
- Stop. Okay, calm down.


999
01:08:22.115 --> 01:08:24.615
Look at me. You can do this.

1000
01:08:24.698 --> 01:08:26.740
[tense music playing]

1001
01:08:30.282 --> 01:08:32.990
That knife's not gonna do you any good.

1002
01:08:33.948 --> 01:08:36.157
You crossed a line, Garrett.

1003
01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.990
There are rules to this.
You remember that, right?


1004
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.365
Yeah? What'd you think
was gonna happen coming here?


1005
01:08:41.448 --> 01:08:43.740
- What'd I think was gonna happen?
- [King] Yeah.


1006
01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.615
[Garrett] It's probably already happened.

1007
01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:51.865
[grunts]

1008
01:08:55.573 --> 01:08:58.032
[breathing heavily, chuckles]

1009
01:08:58.782 --> 01:09:01.323
- [King grunts]
- [chuckling] I fucking knew it.


1010
01:09:01.407 --> 01:09:02.407
What the fuck?

1011
01:09:03.782 --> 01:09:09.032
Here's the thing about people
like you who hide their powers.


1012
01:09:09.115 --> 01:09:12.740
Eventually, you forget how to use them.

1013
01:09:12.823 --> 01:09:15.740
[whirring]

1014
01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:19.823
Hey, I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

1015
01:09:22.657 --> 01:09:24.282
Just try and make it sleep.

1016
01:09:31.198 --> 01:09:33.115
[Garrett] I don't need to ask you why.

1017
01:09:34.323 --> 01:09:36.573
- I see your house.
- [grunting]


1018
01:09:36.657 --> 01:09:37.948
I see your wife. She's pretty.

1019
01:09:38.657 --> 01:09:39.657
Does she know?

1020
01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:42.073
You gonna tell her?

1021
01:09:42.657 --> 01:09:44.577
- You gonna tell your daughter?
- Don't you dare.


1022
01:09:44.657 --> 01:09:47.865
You gave up your powers
to become one of them.


1023
01:09:48.615 --> 01:09:49.782
[gasps]

1024
01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:52.448
Waste.

1025
01:09:56.615 --> 01:09:57.657
And what about you?

1026
01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:00.823
Man of the people.

1027
01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.698
At least I know when I'm pretending.

1028
01:10:07.282 --> 01:10:09.698
[wife] Hey, he said it was urgent.

1029
01:10:10.198 --> 01:10:11.698
Something about your K9.

1030
01:10:13.157 --> 01:10:14.157
Huh.

1031
01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:18.990
Well, Sergeant, I think
we're gonna do big things together.


1032
01:10:19.073 --> 01:10:21.865
[Garrett groaning]

1033
01:10:22.448 --> 01:10:26.198
[clears throat] I hope your dog's okay.
Thank you very much. It was lovely.


1034
01:10:26.282 --> 01:10:27.740
[wife] Nice meeting you.

1035
01:10:30.157 --> 01:10:31.157
Hey.

1036
01:10:31.573 --> 01:10:34.490
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'll tell you about it over dinner.


1037
01:10:34.573 --> 01:10:35.657
[chuckling] Hey.

1038
01:10:36.157 --> 01:10:37.157
I think you got it.

1039
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.282
[both chuckle]

1040
01:10:38.365 --> 01:10:39.573
I love you. I love you.

1041

[inaudible scream]

1043
01:10:57.615 --> 01:10:59.573
[Garrett]
I can't believe that shit worked.


1044
01:10:59.657 --> 01:11:01.865
- Garrett, you got anything?
- Skies are clear.


1045
01:11:02.365 --> 01:11:04.198
Good. Your guys, they'll be ready?

1046
01:11:04.282 --> 01:11:05.282
Yeah.

1047
01:11:05.615 --> 01:11:07.782
- Garrett.
- Connor, they'll be ready.


1048
01:11:10.157 --> 01:11:12.490
Okay. Pav, what do you see?

1049
01:11:18.032 --> 01:11:19.032
I see everything.

1050
01:11:42.282 --> 01:11:44.841
[officer] <i>Got a hit on your K9.</i>
<i>They just pulled into the Towers.</i>


1051
01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:46.698
How do you wanna play this?
Wanna go in heavy?


1052
01:11:46.782 --> 01:11:48.573
[King] <i>No. Only men on our payroll.</i>

1053
01:11:48.657 --> 01:11:50.240
No Guardians, no lethal force.

1054
01:11:51.365 --> 01:11:52.365
<i>Gear them up.</i>

1055
01:11:52.782 --> 01:11:53.782
Copy. Nonlethals.

1056
01:11:56.532 --> 01:11:57.698
All right, let's move!

1057
01:11:58.198 --> 01:11:59.448
We're gearing up.

1058
01:12:02.032 --> 01:12:04.532
[suspenseful music playing]

1059
01:12:09.448 --> 01:12:10.532
[elevator bell dings]

1060
01:12:36.073 --> 01:12:37.823
[Garrett] Put the dog down, Connor.

1061
01:12:38.323 --> 01:12:40.532
[scoffs] You gotta be kidding me.

1062
01:12:41.907 --> 01:12:43.032
I don't understand.

1063
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:46.240
Where's the computer?

1064
01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:50.948
Fuck you. [grunts]

1065
01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:52.990
[groaning]

1066
01:12:58.657 --> 01:13:01.240
A lot of people
depend on this place, Connor.


1067
01:13:01.323 --> 01:13:02.573
[Connor gasping for air]

1068
01:13:02.657 --> 01:13:04.282
[Garrett] We know what's on the dog.

1069
01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.990
If I control that,

1070
01:13:09.157 --> 01:13:10.698
then I can control King.

1071
01:13:11.948 --> 01:13:14.157
And we can run this place
the way that we wanna run it.


1072
01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.073
[Connor laughs]

1073
01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.997
[Garrett] No more cops
breathing down our neck.


1074
01:13:17.032 --> 01:13:21.948
Oh my God. Do you actually hear the shit
that is coming out of your mouth?


1075
01:13:22.823 --> 01:13:23.823
[sighs]

1076
01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.282
I trusted you!

1077
01:13:34.448 --> 01:13:35.448
I'm sorry.

1078
01:13:36.198 --> 01:13:38.157
This is bigger than your brother.

1079
01:13:39.823 --> 01:13:41.407
Guard that with your life.

1080
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:43.282
[sinister music playing]

1081
01:13:43.365 --> 01:13:47.615
[dispatcher] <i>Pulling up to the Towers now.</i>
<i>Riot control ready and standing by.</i>

[sinister music playing]

1083
01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:57.657
There's a lot of eyes on us, boss.

1084
01:13:58.573 --> 01:13:59.573
Yeah.

1085
01:13:59.907 --> 01:14:02.032
Tell the boys to
keep it tight. No bodies.

1086
01:14:02.573 --> 01:14:04.907
- You know what we're here for.
- Copy that.


1087
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:08.532
All right, everybody on this channel,
listen up. Switch to nonlethals.


1088
01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:11.365
Do not shoot, do not engage.
Stay nonlethal.


1089
01:14:14.407 --> 01:14:15.782
[Garrett] Brought your pet.

1090
01:14:15.865 --> 01:14:17.282
Left the head upstairs.

1091
01:14:17.782 --> 01:14:19.198
Got all the data.

1092
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.198
The important shit.

1093
01:14:23.282 --> 01:14:24.365
It stays up there.

1094
01:14:25.823 --> 01:14:26.907
That so?

1095
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:29.032
Yeah. We know what's on there.

1096
01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:32.615
You know what happens if it comes out.

1097
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.990
- What do you want, Garrett?
- I want a new deal.


1098
01:14:40.115 --> 01:14:42.282
We're gonna cut your share in half.

1099
01:14:43.865 --> 01:14:44.990
Half?

1100
01:14:45.073 --> 01:14:46.157
Half.

1101
01:14:47.323 --> 01:14:48.323
Turn around,

1102
01:14:49.198 --> 01:14:52.073
go high-five your buddies,
get in your fucking clown cars,


1103
01:14:52.157 --> 01:14:53.782
and get the fuck out of here.

1104
01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:55.907
[sinister music continues]

1105
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:57.115
It's my people.

1106
01:14:58.698 --> 01:14:59.782
It's my business.

1107
01:15:00.948 --> 01:15:04.990
And if any of you so much
as look at any of us the wrong way,


1108
01:15:05.073 --> 01:15:07.032
and that includes Connor and Pav,

1109
01:15:08.448 --> 01:15:09.448
all this…

1110
01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.073
