<b>Screamers The Hunting 2009 
- English</b>

2
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:15.206
- Okay. It looks clear.

3
00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:17.250
- Are you sure that's the place?

4
00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:20.336
- Yeah, the old communication bunker
is on that far Ridge.


5
00:01:20.712 --> 00:01:23.256
- The transmitter's there?
- Well, yeah, it should be.


6
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.218
It'll only take us a couple of minutes
to get there.


7
00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:29.220
And it's secure once we're inside.

8
00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:32.974
- No, no. I don't like it.
- You're too paranoid.


9
00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:36.477
Let's go.

10
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:28.947
- Screamers!

11
00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.669
- Get to higher ground.
- I'll cover you!


12
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.090
Aaah!

13
00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:57.559
- Aaah!

14
00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.605
- Jessie!

15
00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:04.982
- Keep going!
- Okay!


16
00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:09.820
- Aaaah!

17
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.077
- Aaah!

18
00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:10.173
- Transmitter enabled.

19
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.802
Distress signal launched.

20
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.136
- Mommy, mommy, what's wrong?

21
00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:55.296
- Reanimation is now complete.

22
00:06:55.463 --> 00:06:57.298
Please proceed to the med lab.

23
00:07:23.074 --> 00:07:25.534
- You know, I'm not feeling so hot.

24
00:07:25.618 --> 00:07:28.203
I think this might be your last chance.

25
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.124
- You must stay very calm
while I check your signs.


26
00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:33.918
Think of your wife.

27
00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:43.260
- Olof, you look really pale.
- Are you okay?


28
00:07:43.344 --> 00:07:47.056
- Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.
- I love space travel.


29
00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:51.727
As did my viking ancestors.
They did it all the time.


30
00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:55.940
- Vikings hibernated for two months.
- No, we traveled for two months.


31
00:07:56.107 --> 00:07:59.068
And then without sleep,
we would fight a campaign


32
00:07:59.194 --> 00:08:01.905
and move on to pillage other lands.

33
00:08:01.946 --> 00:08:06.325
We were ruthless.
We were relentless. Like myself.


34
00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:11.163
We lived better. We died better.
Did you know that...


35
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:12.850
- That viking chieftains...
- Viking chieftains...


36
00:08:12.874 --> 00:08:16.502
were burned in their boats?
Yes, we know, olof.


37
00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:18.754
- Well, it's a tradition.

38
00:08:18.838 --> 00:08:21.799
And if we don't have tradition,
then we're nothing but savages.


39
00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:25.344
- You know, I could be a savage.

40
00:08:26.554 --> 00:08:28.681
- I can give you something for that.

41
00:08:35.313 --> 00:08:36.856
- How did you sleep, lieutenant?

42
00:08:37.023 --> 00:08:39.358
- Cryo sleeps always give me
bad dreams.


43
00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:42.320
- That's too bad. 
I sleep like a baby.

44
00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:47.033
Take a little nap for two months.
Ready to start the mission.


45
00:08:47.117 --> 00:08:50.203
- Excuse me, commander.
- I have to get back to the med lab.


46
00:08:58.503 --> 00:09:02.089
- Bronte, there you are.
- Just in time for your examination.


47
00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:04.092
- Romulo, how's the weapon system
coming'?


48
00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:06.844
- It's looking good, lieutenant.
- Great.


49
00:09:08.054 --> 00:09:10.014
- Hey, morning, sarge.

50
00:09:10.181 --> 00:09:11.599
- Danielli.

51
00:09:14.727 --> 00:09:16.687
- Initiating data module.

52
00:09:17.438 --> 00:09:21.567
Eighty-five years ago,
berynium was discovered on Sirius 6b.


53
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.863
It was thought that this was the answer
to earth's energy shortage,


54
00:09:25.947 --> 00:09:28.324
and a thriving industry quickly
developed.


55
00:09:28.408 --> 00:09:31.577
But in time, the mining company
and their worker-scientists


56
00:09:31.744 --> 00:09:32.745
became bitter enemies,

57
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:35.581
and there was a violent civil war.

58
00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:37.792
The scientists finally got
the upper hand


59
00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:41.295
when they developed the screamer,
a robotic killing machine,


60
00:09:41.462 --> 00:09:45.962
to search out and terminate all human
life, all except those who wore a tab,


61
00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:50.304
an armband device which neutralizes
the sensors of the screamers.


62
00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:52.890
But in time,
the screamers became so numerous


63
00:09:53.057 --> 00:09:56.185
that all human life
was extinguished on Sirius 6b.


64
00:09:56.978 --> 00:10:00.272
It is believed that all screamers
then became inert.


65
00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:03.484
The sole known survivor
from Sirius 6b


66
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:04.943
was colonel Joseph hendrickson,

67
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:07.029
who committed suicide
by blowing up his ship


68
00:10:07.197 --> 00:10:09.908
on re-entry to earth's atmosphere.

69
00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:11.492
This was 13 years ago,

70
00:10:11.659 --> 00:10:13.577
and since then,
there's been no communication


71
00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:16.748
between Sirius 6b and earth.

72
00:10:16.915 --> 00:10:19.375
But then, two months ago,
an emergency sos


73
00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:22.169
was received from the planet.

74
00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:26.173
Your objective is to locate
and rescue any human survivors.


75
00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:29.302
Data module complete.

76
00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:41.688
- All right, as you know, alliance
central has sent us as a rescue team


77
00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:45.150
to try to locate whoever sent that sos
and bring them back home to earth.


78
00:10:45.318 --> 00:10:49.155
Unfortunately, the timeline of our
mission has been shortened considerably.


79
00:10:49.322 --> 00:10:51.240
Danielli.

80
00:10:51.532 --> 00:10:53.867
- In six days,
the planet Sirius 6b will be hit


81
00:10:54.035 --> 00:10:56.537
with the mother of all solar
meteor strikes,


82
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:00.416
a class 10 magellanic storm.

83
00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:04.420
Within 24 hours of the strike,
all life forms will be killed.


84
00:11:04.587 --> 00:11:05.588
And within 48 hours,

85
00:11:05.755 --> 00:11:09.049
Sirius 6b will be nothing
but a galactic slag heap.


86
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:13.845
- So if we don't leave in a week...
- Then we're never leaving.


87
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.598
- Why wasn't this mentioned
in any of the briefings?


88
00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:18.684
- The data wasn't available
two months ago.


89
00:11:18.851 --> 00:11:21.144
- Come on.
- You must have had an idea.


90
00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:23.123
- I knew there might be
a narrow window of opportunity.


91
00:11:23.147 --> 00:11:25.524
- Narrow window?
- Sounds like a suicide mission.


92
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.401
- Not if we act quickly.

93
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.663
- The data indicates the transmission
did originate in this sector.


94
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.748
- Why can't we land directly
on the signal site?


95
00:11:40.915 --> 00:11:44.501
- Now, I wish we could, but there's
so much atmospheric interference here,


96
00:11:44.669 --> 00:11:46.337
we can't pinpoint it.

97
00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:54.606
- One of these days, you're gonna have
to be honest with me, bronte.


98
00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:56.138
- Excuse me?

99
00:11:57.223 --> 00:11:59.308
- About why this mission
is so important to you.


100
00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:02.937
- It's just another job.
- Really?


101
00:12:03.438 --> 00:12:06.083
You have turned down the opportunity
to be commander of your own ship


102
00:12:06.107 --> 00:12:07.983
to volunteer for this assignment.
Why?


103
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.903
- I have my reasons.

104
00:12:11.904 --> 00:12:15.115
Besides, I still have a lot
to learn from you, commander.


105
00:12:17.577 --> 00:12:20.204
- You might be
a very good soldier, lieutenant,


106
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:22.456
but you're a terrible liar.

107
00:12:27.003 --> 00:12:29.213
- Beginning air quality analysis.

108
00:12:34.552 --> 00:12:38.347
Radiation levels on the surface
are within human survivability.


109
00:13:09.045 --> 00:13:11.255
- Until recently,
this planet was a war zone.


110
00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.424
We don't know who or what
is gunning for us,


111
00:13:13.591 --> 00:13:16.885
but the best defense is a good offense.

112
00:13:17.053 --> 00:13:19.680
- Well said, lieutenant. Romulo.

113
00:13:19.847 --> 00:13:23.225
- One crucial piece of survival gear,
this is your tab.


114
00:13:24.268 --> 00:13:27.521
It'll broadcast a signal to the screamers
telling them that you're dead.


115
00:13:28.606 --> 00:13:31.650
If your tab turns red
and the screamer isn't disabled,


116
00:13:31.818 --> 00:13:33.611
you need to modulate the signal.

117
00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:36.071
It'll save your ass, people.

118
00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:38.824
- Screamers?
- I thought they were all decommissioned.


119
00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:41.410
- That was the assumption,
but we don't know for sure.


120
00:13:41.577 --> 00:13:44.496
Now, screamers have been programmed
to kill any living thing,


121
00:13:44.664 --> 00:13:47.184
- and they will do just that unless...
- They think you're dead.


122
00:13:48.084 --> 00:13:52.463
- No, the screamers are manufactured
with a built-in 24-month power supply.


123
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.966
Once that's done, they're scrap metal.
I don't see how it's possible.


124
00:13:56.134 --> 00:13:58.334
- Speculation is that
the later models may have evolved.


125
00:13:58.469 --> 00:14:00.804
- Evolved?
- How does a machine evolve?


126
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.098
- Hope that you
never have to find out.

127
00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:06.352
- You want to stay alive?
- Wear your tabs.


128
00:14:12.567 --> 00:14:14.527
- Check and activate tabs.

129
00:14:16.237 --> 00:14:17.863
- Everybody good?

130
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.616
Let us coordinate timers.

131
00:14:20.783 --> 00:14:23.577
We have six days.
That is a hard window.


132
00:14:23.744 --> 00:14:26.304
If anybody gets separated from
the others, get your ass back here


133
00:14:26.372 --> 00:14:29.625
before the sixth day
because this ship leaves with you


134
00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:31.502
or without you.

135
00:14:31.669 --> 00:14:34.129
On my mark,
let's get in coordination.


136
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.884
Three, two, one. Mark.

137
00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.813
- Welcome to Sirius 6b.

138
00:14:58.988 --> 00:15:02.700
- It's freezing out here.
- I don't know, viking boy.


139
00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:04.636
Looks like you got
the better end of the deal.


140
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.496
- I know.
- Soderquist always stays with his ship.


141
00:15:07.663 --> 00:15:09.081
Hell, it's tradition.

142
00:15:09.248 --> 00:15:11.625
- Just make sure you run a diagnostic
of the main thrusters.


143
00:15:11.792 --> 00:15:14.294
We might have to get out of here
in a hurry.


144
00:15:14.462 --> 00:15:18.716
- Hey. I'll see you in six days, okay?
- Just be safe.


145
00:15:19.675 --> 00:15:22.260
- Six days or not,
don't leave without us.


146
00:15:24.138 --> 00:15:25.180
- Bye.

147
00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:05.596
- We don't have a clue, do we?

148
00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:09.641
- About what?
- Any of this.


149
00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:12.311
Where the transmission was sent from,
where they are.


150
00:16:12.478 --> 00:16:16.978
- Well, whoever sent it,
they're probably looking for us, too.


151
00:16:23.072 --> 00:16:24.114
- Hey!

152
00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:29.203
- What the hell are you doing?
- I saw something.


153
00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:31.997
- I don't see anything.

154
00:16:32.164 --> 00:16:35.876
- Keep it in your pants, cowboy.
- It's a rescue mission.


155
00:16:37.169 --> 00:16:40.964
- Come on. Keep heading down the hill.
- Try not to kill one of us.


156
00:17:09.452 --> 00:17:10.995
- Got a reading from over there.

157
00:17:11.162 --> 00:17:13.038
It's an underground structure
of some kind.


158
00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:18.168
- I'm gonna take a look.

159
00:17:20.004 --> 00:17:21.547
Here, give me the scope.

160
00:17:32.642 --> 00:17:35.403
It looks like some sort of bunker.
I'm gonna go down and check it out.


161
00:17:37.897 --> 00:17:39.940
We're going down the hill
to check out a bunker.


162
00:18:20.106 --> 00:18:21.607
- What's that sound?

163
00:18:23.818 --> 00:18:24.902
- Aaah!

164
00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:26.695
- My hand! It burns!
- Against the wall!


165
00:18:28.155 --> 00:18:29.739
- What happened?
- It burns!


166
00:18:32.952 --> 00:18:37.122
- What is it?
- It's ra6. Radioactive acid.


167
00:18:37.289 --> 00:18:40.208
One of the by-products of mining here
and the reason the war started.


168
00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:42.836
- Acid? I have a neutralizing base.

169
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.491
- Lieutenant, we got a vent up here!

170
00:18:50.594 --> 00:18:52.804
- Okay.
- It could lead to the bunker.


171
00:18:53.806 --> 00:18:55.724
- Keep moving. Keep moving.

172
00:18:56.976 --> 00:18:58.978
- Sergeant, we're coming to you.

173
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.149
- Open it.

174
00:19:19.415 --> 00:19:22.835
- This is promising. It looks like
it's part of a whole complex.


175
00:19:25.671 --> 00:19:27.964
I'm getting a reading from over here.

176
00:19:29.216 --> 00:19:30.467
This way.

177
00:20:01.749 --> 00:20:03.125
This is where they made them.

178
00:20:03.292 --> 00:20:05.502
- Made what?
- The screamers. This is the factory.


179
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:07.754
- Actually, this is where
they made themselves.


180
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.172
- Made themselves?

181
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.801
- Screamer production was fully
automated ever since it began.


182
00:20:12.968 --> 00:20:16.471
No humans have been down here
since production started.


183
00:20:19.058 --> 00:20:21.935
- Morphology is really striking.
- Anybody know who designed these?


184
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.610
- The early varieties are credited
to an engineer named orsow or Barlow,


185
00:20:25.689 --> 00:20:27.899
I can't remember.

186
00:20:28.484 --> 00:20:31.612
The later models were supposed to
have been designed by other screamers.


187
00:20:32.905 --> 00:20:35.574
- These were made by other machines?

188
00:20:35.741 --> 00:20:38.493
It's not possible. These must be
the original designer's work.


189
00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:43.456
- Unlikely. We think he was killed
by a prototype during the early tests.


190
00:20:43.624 --> 00:20:46.084
- They were supposed to be great
scavengers.


191
00:20:46.252 --> 00:20:49.296
Didn't just slice and dice,
but came back to pick up all the pieces.


192
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.010
- That's sick. Why would anyone do that?
- Not anyone, schwartzy.


193
00:20:55.177 --> 00:20:56.178
We're talking machines.

194
00:20:56.345 --> 00:20:59.681
And the reason is simple.
There was a shortage of raw materials.


195
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.101
Pun intended.

196
00:21:02.768 --> 00:21:05.812
- Bones for parts?
- But these are just machines.


197
00:21:07.231 --> 00:21:08.815
Right, bronte?

198
00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:13.320
- So, what, did their batteries
just die out?


199
00:21:13.487 --> 00:21:16.198
- They have this failsafe design
that limits their running time.


200
00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:18.116
- Guys, let's go.

201
00:21:18.284 --> 00:21:21.244
Quit playing around with that thing.
We have to make it back to the medusa.


202
00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:23.371
- What is this?

203
00:21:25.165 --> 00:21:28.334
Commander?
You might want to take a look at this.


204
00:21:41.348 --> 00:21:43.266
Can you believe this?

205
00:21:46.228 --> 00:21:47.646
- This place is massive.

206
00:22:07.791 --> 00:22:09.709
- There's so many of them.

207
00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:14.631
- I had no idea.

208
00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:38.489
- We're not gonna have enough time

209
00:22:38.656 --> 00:22:40.658
to get back to the medusa
before nightfall.


210
00:22:40.824 --> 00:22:43.618
- Okay, we bunk here tonight.
- Great.


211
00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:46.538
Home sweet home.

212
00:22:50.793 --> 00:22:52.669
- Some of the glove melted in there.

213
00:22:53.837 --> 00:22:54.963
- Ah...

214
00:22:58.092 --> 00:22:59.301
- God, what a mess.

215
00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:03.138
- You know, if the screamers really
butchered their creators on Sirius 6b,


216
00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:04.945
just imagine what they'd do
back on earth.


217
00:23:05.015 --> 00:23:06.182
- But those are just stories.

218
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.518
We don't really know
what happened here, do we?


219
00:23:08.686 --> 00:23:11.146
- We have colonel hendrickson's
final transmissions.


220
00:23:11.313 --> 00:23:14.274
- The delusional ravings
of a shell-shocked soldier.


221
00:23:15.693 --> 00:23:18.380
- You know, the cyber-technology alone
would be worth a small fortune.


222
00:23:18.404 --> 00:23:20.906
- "A small fortune"?
- Try "enough to buy a planet."


223
00:23:21.073 --> 00:23:22.115
- It's not gonna happen.

224
00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:23.783
Alliance central has put a total ban

225
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:25.786
on importing any screamer technology
to earth.


226
00:23:26.328 --> 00:23:29.539
- The alliance thinks the screamers
are just a plague waiting to happen.


227
00:25:40.003 --> 00:25:42.005
Charge target.

228
00:26:37.769 --> 00:26:38.769
Connect.

229
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.568
Download all the files.
Everything in the hard drive.


230
00:26:45.527 --> 00:26:48.905
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.


231
00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.896
- Are you back?

232
00:29:02.414 --> 00:29:03.706
Danielli?

233
00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:10.922
Guys?

234
00:29:16.219 --> 00:29:17.553
Gentlemen?

235
00:30:20.784 --> 00:30:23.703
- Looks like one of the larger
berynium mines.


236
00:30:25.747 --> 00:30:27.790
I'm getting a life-form reading
from inside.


237
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.921
- Let's go check it out.

238
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.473
- Get down!
- Take cover!


239
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.433
- Defensive positions!

240
00:30:49.771 --> 00:30:52.565
- Can you see anything up there?
- No, I can't see anything.


241
00:30:53.442 --> 00:30:55.777
- Bronte, I'm blind.
- I need you to be my eyes.


242
00:30:55.944 --> 00:30:57.654
I need numbers and a location.

243
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:06.370
- They've dug in deep, commander.
- Ten to 15 of them.


244
00:31:07.539 --> 00:31:09.999
- I can get them with this.
- Just drop something in close.


245
00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:13.587
Give them a taste of the fire power.
Let them know we mean business here.


246
00:31:18.133 --> 00:31:19.592
- Down!

247
00:31:21.803 --> 00:31:23.638
- I think you got their attention.

248
00:31:24.723 --> 00:31:27.726
- Hello! Can you hear me up there?

249
00:31:29.227 --> 00:31:31.062
- Commander, I see two scouts.

250
00:31:31.229 --> 00:31:34.232
They're both positioned
on the Ridge above you.


251
00:31:35.066 --> 00:31:39.403
- We're from earth! Do you understand?
- We've come to help you!


252
00:31:42.699 --> 00:31:46.911
- "We're from earth!
- We've come to help you!"


253
00:31:48.163 --> 00:31:49.789
Kiss my ass!

254
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:53.167
- Aaah!

255
00:31:53.793 --> 00:31:55.211
- Madden!

256
00:31:55.378 --> 00:31:57.129
- I'll cover you.
- Okay.


257
00:32:09.851 --> 00:32:11.269
- You are not hit!

258
00:32:15.732 --> 00:32:17.817
- You see, Schwartz, you do care.

259
00:32:18.735 --> 00:32:20.486
- How is he?
- He's fine.


260
00:32:23.156 --> 00:32:26.617
- If they sent the sos, they've got
a strange way of asking for help.


261
00:32:26.785 --> 00:32:29.454
- Okay, this is a kill zone here.
- We got to make it downhill.


262
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:31.039
Bronte, you cover!

263
00:32:31.206 --> 00:32:32.874
- Let's move!
- Go, go, go, go, go!


264
00:32:33.583 --> 00:32:34.709
Move, danielli!

265
00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:36.460
Go! Go! Go!

266
00:32:36.628 --> 00:32:39.297
- Bronte. Give me more cover fire.

267
00:32:42.926 --> 00:32:45.929
- Romulo, take point, take point.
- Pull back. Hurry.


268
00:32:46.096 --> 00:32:48.181
- Move it people. 
Hustle, hustle!

269
00:32:54.187 --> 00:32:55.605
- Schwartz!

270
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.399
Schwartz.

271
00:32:59.985 --> 00:33:01.069
- Bronte, look out!

272
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:09.160
- Hannah, let's get out of here!
- Screamers!


273
00:33:09.327 --> 00:33:12.288
- Modulate your tabs!
- Everybody check your tabs!


274
00:33:23.425 --> 00:33:25.385
- Where's my tab? 
I lost my tab!

275
00:33:27.929 --> 00:33:29.430
- Screamers!

276
00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:05.758
- Here. Take mine.
- No, man.


277
00:34:05.925 --> 00:34:07.760
- Take it.
- What are you gonna...


278
00:34:07.927 --> 00:34:09.261
- Take it!

279
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.522
- All right, people, we're moving out.

280
00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:21.249
- Move! Move!
- I'll take forward point.


281
00:34:21.316 --> 00:34:23.943
- Move! Everybody, move now!
- Move!


282
00:34:26.196 --> 00:34:27.780
- Bronte, look out!

283
00:34:29.074 --> 00:34:30.283
- Romulo!

284
00:34:31.284 --> 00:34:32.785
"No!

285
00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:45.215
"Rom?

286
00:34:54.224 --> 00:34:57.018
- Go. Get them out of here.

287
00:34:57.185 --> 00:34:58.811
- No.

288
00:34:58.978 --> 00:35:00.062
Go!

289
00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:13.159
- All right, let's go! Move!

290
00:35:24.421 --> 00:35:25.672
(Gunshon

291
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:27.673
(gunshon

292
00:35:41.104 --> 00:35:42.313
- eat this, you bastards!

293
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:51.489
- This is commander sexton.
- Come in, medusa.


294
00:35:51.656 --> 00:35:53.532
Come in. Soderquist?

295
00:35:53.867 --> 00:35:57.245
Do you hear me, soderquist?
This is commander sexton.


296
00:35:57.954 --> 00:35:59.914
Soderquist! Come in!

297
00:36:02.709 --> 00:36:04.478
I'm not getting any reply.
We're going back to the medusa now.


298
00:36:04.502 --> 00:36:05.604
- Sir, what about the mission?

299
00:36:05.628 --> 00:36:07.690
- I am not risking the lives of any more
of my crew members.


300
00:36:07.714 --> 00:36:11.134
- We're leaving this planet now.
- One of those people sent the sos.


301
00:36:11.301 --> 00:36:12.927
- Those people are homicidal savages.

302
00:36:13.094 --> 00:36:16.680
- We all knew the risks
before volunteering to do this.


303
00:36:16.848 --> 00:36:18.307
I never signed up for this.

304
00:36:18.641 --> 00:36:20.726
- I just gave you a direct order,
lieutenant.


305
00:36:20.935 --> 00:36:23.520
We are going to
the medusa now. So move.

306
00:36:24.564 --> 00:36:25.565
- Yes, sir.

307
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.208
- Soderquist?

308
00:37:28.336 --> 00:37:29.420
Soderquist?

309
00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:40.390
- What the hell happened?
- Bronte, get us out of here.


310
00:37:40.557 --> 00:37:43.768
Danielli, check the systems.
Make sure the ship is secure.


311
00:37:43.935 --> 00:37:45.895
- Schwartz! Schwartz!
- Just give her a second.


312
00:37:46.062 --> 00:37:47.897
- I'm the commander here!

313
00:37:54.529 --> 00:37:56.405
Get soderquist down.

314
00:37:56.573 --> 00:37:58.533
- Commander!

315
00:37:59.284 --> 00:38:00.910
You better get in here.

316
00:38:02.912 --> 00:38:05.472
- Our fuel cells have been drained.
- What are you talking about?


317
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.780
- Drained. Empty.
- We've got enough for basic functions.


318
00:38:08.543 --> 00:38:11.337
- But we're never gonna make it home.
- I think I know why.


319
00:38:14.883 --> 00:38:17.218
- Look at the security log.
- Screamer.


320
00:38:17.385 --> 00:38:19.887
- Oh, my god.
- It's from yesterday.


321
00:38:21.014 --> 00:38:23.433
The screamer is draining the fuel cells.

322
00:38:23.975 --> 00:38:26.394
- It looks just like the one
at the factory.


323
00:38:27.145 --> 00:38:30.148
- I don't have time for your speculation.

324
00:38:30.315 --> 00:38:32.115
We have a situation
that we need to deal with.


325
00:38:32.275 --> 00:38:34.318
We need to find a fuel supply,

326
00:38:34.485 --> 00:38:36.612
a military depot,
a power source, something!


327
00:38:36.779 --> 00:38:39.323
- We have three days, commander.
- Face it, it's impossible.


328
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.783
- Not necessarily. 
We're gonna get help.

329
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:43.888
- What are you talking about?
- Those people at the mines.


330
00:38:43.912 --> 00:38:46.956
- You're gonna trust those lunatics
to help us?


331
00:38:47.123 --> 00:38:49.416
- No, wait. Bronte is right.

332
00:38:49.584 --> 00:38:51.919
They're our only shot.
We have to take the chance.


333
00:39:10.647 --> 00:39:12.190
- This is awful.

334
00:39:13.316 --> 00:39:15.526
- It's the best we could do.

335
00:39:15.693 --> 00:39:18.779
He wanted to be cremated
like his ancestors.


336
00:39:25.954 --> 00:39:28.039
- We move out at daybreak.

337
00:39:28.206 --> 00:39:32.043
Lieutenant, make sure everyone has
their armor and the proper weaponry.


338
00:39:45.431 --> 00:39:46.765
- Let's go.

339
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.272
- She's alone, and definitely the one
who attacked us yesterday.


340
00:40:36.399 --> 00:40:38.901
- Can we outflank her?
- Yes.


341
00:40:39.068 --> 00:40:41.153
- I'll go.
- No. I'll go.


342
00:40:43.406 --> 00:40:46.158
- Madden, grab these and cover her.
- Come on.


343
00:41:25.782 --> 00:41:27.116
- Don't move!

344
00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:30.786
Stay where you are! Don't move.

345
00:41:30.953 --> 00:41:33.038
Stay away from the weapon.

346
00:41:36.334 --> 00:41:37.626
Look out!

347
00:41:47.762 --> 00:41:49.555
- You're gonna kill me now?

348
00:41:49.722 --> 00:41:52.516
- No. I'm here to reason with you.

349
00:41:55.144 --> 00:41:56.770
I'm gonna lower my weapon.

350
00:41:56.938 --> 00:42:00.650
Please do not try anything.

351
00:42:05.363 --> 00:42:07.031
- Why'd you come back?

352
00:42:09.033 --> 00:42:11.160
- Screamers attacked our ship.

353
00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:14.830
- You really are from earth.

354
00:42:14.997 --> 00:42:17.040
- Yes.

355
00:42:17.416 --> 00:42:18.583
- Unreal.

356
00:42:19.627 --> 00:42:21.670
- And I need
to speak to your people.

357
00:42:21.838 --> 00:42:23.256
Please.

358
00:42:26.676 --> 00:42:27.968
- I'll take you.

359
00:42:29.595 --> 00:42:31.430
But then you're on your own.

360
00:42:34.183 --> 00:42:35.309
Follow me.

361
00:43:11.387 --> 00:43:13.055
- And who are you?

362
00:43:14.682 --> 00:43:16.225
- Commander sexton.

363
00:43:16.392 --> 00:43:18.769
Alliance central received an sos
from this planet.


364
00:43:18.936 --> 00:43:22.397
- We were sent to investigate,
render assistance to any survivors.


365
00:43:22.815 --> 00:43:24.483
Bring them back home to earth.

366
00:43:24.775 --> 00:43:27.110
- That's a good story.
- It's not a story.


367
00:43:27.278 --> 00:43:29.078
You can come check out our ship
if you'd like.


368
00:43:29.238 --> 00:43:31.156
- What do you want?

369
00:43:31.365 --> 00:43:33.241
- Screamers got onboard our ship

370
00:43:33.409 --> 00:43:35.828
when we were out looking
for the source of the sos.


371
00:43:35.995 --> 00:43:38.998
They drained our fuel cells.
We need help finding more.


372
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.583
- So you're stranded?
- Worse.


373
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:44.837
In two days, this planet
is going to be hit


374
00:43:45.004 --> 00:43:46.630
with a class 10 magellanic storm.

375
00:43:46.797 --> 00:43:49.424
It's gonna kill
every living organism here.


376
00:43:49.967 --> 00:43:51.927
If you help us find more fuel,

377
00:43:52.094 --> 00:43:54.805
you can come with us,
back to earth.


378
00:43:54.972 --> 00:43:56.556
- And if we don't?

379
00:43:56.724 --> 00:43:59.518
- Then we all die.

380
00:44:01.395 --> 00:44:02.562
- Unreal.

381
00:44:11.864 --> 00:44:13.115
- It sounds like a trap.

382
00:44:13.282 --> 00:44:14.843
- Have you forgotten
that I saved Hannah's life?


383
00:44:14.867 --> 00:44:17.953
- We saw what you did...
- And it means nothing.


384
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.330
Different varieties of screamers
are fighting


385
00:44:20.498 --> 00:44:22.875
and killing each other every day.

386
00:44:23.042 --> 00:44:26.712
As far as we're concerned,
you could be the newest model.


387
00:44:27.588 --> 00:44:29.881
- Me? You think I'm a screamer?

388
00:44:32.009 --> 00:44:34.302
- I'm as human as you are.
- Fine.


389
00:44:36.389 --> 00:44:37.973
Give me your hand.

390
00:44:38.307 --> 00:44:40.517
- Bronte.
- I'm not talking to you.


391
00:44:42.853 --> 00:44:44.646
Give me your hand.

392
00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.031
- Aah!

393
00:44:54.198 --> 00:44:55.824
- Back away now!

394
00:45:07.253 --> 00:45:08.420
- It's real.

395
00:45:09.714 --> 00:45:11.590
It's the only way to tell.

396
00:45:11.757 --> 00:45:13.633
- You actually thought
I could be one of them?


397
00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:15.511
- Anyone can be.

398
00:45:15.678 --> 00:45:17.447
- You know, the screamers are machines.
- We've seen what they look like.


399
00:45:17.471 --> 00:45:18.824
They're made of circuits and servos.

400
00:45:18.848 --> 00:45:21.141
- No. Not the newer models.

401
00:45:23.519 --> 00:45:25.062
- So, how do
we know you're not one?

402
00:45:48.002 --> 00:45:51.046
- Looks like this is your new home,
for now.


403
00:45:57.011 --> 00:46:00.180
- Do you know of any military depots
where we could find fuel cells?


404
00:46:00.389 --> 00:46:02.516
- Never heard of any in these parts.

405
00:46:02.641 --> 00:46:04.684
- Don't worry.
- We'll find you what you need.


406
00:46:04.852 --> 00:46:06.812
- Do you know of some place specific?

407
00:46:06.979 --> 00:46:09.481
- One. But it's too dangerous now.

408
00:46:11.442 --> 00:46:14.361
- How do you survive down here?
- What do you eat?


409
00:46:15.404 --> 00:46:18.156
- We forage. We scrounge a lot.

410
00:46:18.324 --> 00:46:19.760
- We live off
what the land gives us.

411
00:46:19.784 --> 00:46:22.077
- Screamers never sleep.

412
00:46:22.244 --> 00:46:25.080
We have to keep someone on guard
around the clock.


413
00:46:25.664 --> 00:46:27.290
- What happens if they get in?

414
00:46:27.458 --> 00:46:30.169
- We blow the tunnel
with these explosives.


415
00:46:31.212 --> 00:46:32.630
But they're not gonna get in.

416
00:46:32.797 --> 00:46:34.381
- Bronte, Madden, let's go.

417
00:46:35.883 --> 00:46:38.719
- There were about 400 survivors
in the beginning.


418
00:46:38.886 --> 00:46:41.430
The screamers killed off most of us.

419
00:46:41.597 --> 00:46:44.641
- It must be hell living
in fear of the screamers all the time.


420
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:46.477
- You call this living?

421
00:47:16.257 --> 00:47:18.759
- Help us. Please.

422
00:47:27.017 --> 00:47:30.812
- You can't get too close.
- It's electromagnetic.


423
00:47:35.693 --> 00:47:37.486
- Who's done this to you?

424
00:47:39.613 --> 00:47:41.031
Why are you being kept here?

425
00:47:42.783 --> 00:47:44.576
- You don't want to know.

426
00:47:47.788 --> 00:47:50.248
They do things.

427
00:47:52.126 --> 00:47:55.712
They do horrible things to us.

428
00:48:05.222 --> 00:48:07.098
- I'm coming back for you.

429
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.650
- Please!
- Please!


430
00:48:19.778 --> 00:48:21.488
Please!

431
00:48:33.667 --> 00:48:34.668
- Hey-

432
00:48:45.054 --> 00:48:46.764
how's your hand?

433
00:48:47.932 --> 00:48:49.058
- It'll heal.

434
00:48:49.225 --> 00:48:51.268
- That's good. I'm...

435
00:48:53.646 --> 00:48:55.606
sorry about that.

436
00:48:58.776 --> 00:49:00.194
- Where's my team?

437
00:49:26.554 --> 00:49:28.180
- Where in the hell have you been?

438
00:49:28.222 --> 00:49:29.556
- I was worried.

439
00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:33.810
- Listen.
- They're keeping kids in here prisoner.


440
00:49:33.978 --> 00:49:35.104
Three of them.

441
00:49:35.271 --> 00:49:36.814
It's horrible.

442
00:49:36.981 --> 00:49:38.816
There's something really wrong.

443
00:49:38.983 --> 00:49:42.444
Okay, there's some kind
of dissection table.


444
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:44.821
Human bones are scattered everywhere.

445
00:49:44.989 --> 00:49:47.616
- What? No, you don't mean...
- It's not possible.


446
00:49:47.783 --> 00:49:49.576
- No, you remember what
that guy Bryce said.


447
00:49:49.743 --> 00:49:53.580
- "We forage. We scrounge.
- We live off what the land gives us."


448
00:49:55.374 --> 00:49:57.209
- People don't do that.

449
00:49:57.376 --> 00:49:58.460
- Well...

450
00:49:58.627 --> 00:49:59.627
- They don't.

451
00:49:59.712 --> 00:50:02.673
- Well, cannibalism in times of famine,
it happens.


452
00:50:07.261 --> 00:50:09.846
- I wanna see those kids.

453
00:50:10.014 --> 00:50:11.640
- I'm coming with you.

454
00:50:14.143 --> 00:50:16.728
- Schwartz, you and Madden hang tight.

455
00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.941
- Why?

456
00:50:34.496 --> 00:50:36.581
- My god. What is this place?

457
00:50:46.759 --> 00:50:49.595
- Please. Let us go.

458
00:50:57.853 --> 00:50:59.563
- We got to
get them out of here.

459
00:51:00.064 --> 00:51:03.525
- And then what?
- We have to find our own fuel source.


460
00:51:03.692 --> 00:51:06.695
- Look at this place, commander.
- They were lying to us the entire time.


461
00:51:06.862 --> 00:51:07.988
They're never gonna help us.

462
00:51:09.323 --> 00:51:11.783
You saw how he licked her blood
off the knife.


463
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:14.911
- Okay.

464
00:51:15.037 --> 00:51:16.637
Hurry up. Get them down.
We have to move.


465
00:51:21.168 --> 00:51:22.961
- It's like a capacitor.

466
00:51:26.215 --> 00:51:28.008
- Hurry it up.
- Just give us a second.


467
00:51:29.551 --> 00:51:31.191
- We have to cut
the power source somehow.


468
00:51:31.512 --> 00:51:32.971
- Wait. Let's try this.

469
00:51:34.848 --> 00:51:36.182
I have an idea.

470
00:51:38.352 --> 00:51:39.603
The acid.

471
00:51:44.108 --> 00:51:46.294
Don't be afraid. We're gonna get
you guys out of here. Okay?


472
00:51:46.318 --> 00:51:47.986
You're coming with us.
Do you understand?


473
00:51:48.153 --> 00:51:49.654
- We can come with you?

474
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.428
- Wait. Wait.

475
00:52:14.471 --> 00:52:15.472
- Thank you.

476
00:52:15.639 --> 00:52:17.724
- It's okay. You're safe now.

477
00:52:26.775 --> 00:52:27.775
- Danielli!

478
00:52:29.027 --> 00:52:30.027
- Bronte!

479
00:52:34.616 --> 00:52:36.200
- No!
- Danielli!


480
00:52:38.662 --> 00:52:41.289
I don't have a clean shot.
I want you to clear out of the way!


481
00:53:32.925 --> 00:53:36.053
- He loves me, he loves me not.

482
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:40.515
He loves me, he loves me not.

483
00:53:48.398 --> 00:53:52.151
He loves me, he loves me not.

484
00:53:53.278 --> 00:53:56.781
He loves me, he loves me not.

485
00:54:00.953 --> 00:54:02.204
- Stop it.

486
00:54:04.998 --> 00:54:05.999
I said stop it.

487
00:54:06.166 --> 00:54:07.375
- Stop what?

488
00:54:07.543 --> 00:54:10.128
- The noise you're making
with your knife.


489
00:54:12.631 --> 00:54:14.215
- Dwight, look out!

490
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.559
- Hey, behind you!

491
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:37.822
- Guy, look out!

492
00:54:49.334 --> 00:54:50.918
- Who let them out?

493
00:54:51.086 --> 00:54:54.839
- It was me. I'm sorry.
- I had no idea.


494
00:54:57.134 --> 00:54:58.593
- He's still alive!

495
00:55:32.127 --> 00:55:33.628
- Are they machines?

496
00:55:37.007 --> 00:55:39.300
They were all screamers?

497
00:55:39.468 --> 00:55:42.137
- How can this be?
- They're prototypes.


498
00:55:42.304 --> 00:55:43.930
The newest variety.

499
00:55:44.097 --> 00:55:45.932
- Where's danielli?

500
00:55:46.099 --> 00:55:47.475
- They killed him.

501
00:55:49.519 --> 00:55:51.812
- They've gotten in.
- How do we get out of here?


502
00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.064
- Follow me.

503
00:56:00.781 --> 00:56:03.909
- Keep heading up.
- Main entrance, at the top.


504
00:56:04.076 --> 00:56:06.787
- Bronte, cover him
and then meet up with us.


505
00:56:20.676 --> 00:56:22.928
- We're good. Go! Go!

506
00:56:44.908 --> 00:56:46.743
- Unreal.

507
00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:48.745
- We have to keep moving.

508
00:56:48.912 --> 00:56:51.205
- Go!
- It's okay.


509
00:58:19.461 --> 00:58:22.255
- He loves me, he loves me not.

510
00:58:23.298 --> 00:58:26.092
He loves me, he loves me not.

511
00:58:26.635 --> 00:58:28.178
He loves me.

512
00:58:33.266 --> 00:58:34.934
He loves me not.

513
00:58:37.104 --> 00:58:39.397
- I'm sorry I didn't trust you before.

514
00:58:44.402 --> 00:58:48.902
I've had so many people die
around me recently.


515
00:58:50.659 --> 00:58:54.120
My brother went out on patrol
a couple of months ago.


516
00:58:54.287 --> 00:58:55.955
He never came back.

517
00:58:57.666 --> 00:58:59.125
- I'm sorry.

518
00:59:01.169 --> 00:59:02.837
- We were so close, you know.

519
00:59:12.472 --> 00:59:14.682
I've lived here my whole life.

520
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.104
You are the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.


521
00:59:24.985 --> 00:59:26.111
- Lieutenant?

522
00:59:27.821 --> 00:59:29.906
I found another mine
on the other side of the Ridge.


523
00:59:30.073 --> 00:59:31.282
We're gonna set up camp there.

524
00:59:31.449 --> 00:59:33.409
It should give us good cover
for the night.


525
00:59:34.119 --> 00:59:36.788
Let's go. The storm is gonna be here
before we know it.


526
00:59:36.955 --> 00:59:38.039
We're moving out.

527
00:59:49.926 --> 00:59:51.010
Hey-

528
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.638
this is your planet.

529
00:59:53.805 --> 00:59:57.141
Do you have any ideas?
Somewhere we can find fuel cells?


530
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:59.686
- There's a bombed-out
power relay station.


531
01:00:01.062 --> 01:00:03.230
Half a day's walk, maybe.

532
01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:05.650
Might find something there.

533
01:00:06.318 --> 01:00:08.111
- We'll head out in the morning.

534
01:00:48.401 --> 01:00:49.735
- Is it my turn for watch?

535
01:00:49.903 --> 01:00:52.447
- No. Not for another hour.

536
01:00:53.782 --> 01:00:56.910
- So, then, what are you doing?
- You're so stupid.


537
01:00:59.913 --> 01:01:02.457
You don't know anything about him.

538
01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.293
- I don't know anything about you either.

539
01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:08.004
- You're so naive.

540
01:01:11.508 --> 01:01:14.469
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Humans are irrational.


541
01:01:14.636 --> 01:01:19.136
But he... he never does anything
without a reason.


542
01:01:20.475 --> 01:01:22.727
- Hey! Leave her alone.

543
01:01:42.872 --> 01:01:44.373
Are you okay?

544
01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.460
- Yeah.

545
01:01:52.507 --> 01:01:54.258
- Why are you here?

546
01:01:54.426 --> 01:01:56.636
- I volunteered for the mission.
- No.


547
01:01:58.346 --> 01:01:59.847
Tell me the truth.

548
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.197
- Maybe we should be
the ones standing watch.


549
01:02:27.584 --> 01:02:28.751
- Hey-

550
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:30.544
bronte.

551
01:02:33.673 --> 01:02:35.049
Talk to me.

552
01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.305
- Bronte was my mother's name.

553
01:02:41.806 --> 01:02:43.933
My father left before I was born.

554
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.228
I never met him.
His name was Joseph hendrickson.


555
01:02:47.395 --> 01:02:49.397
- Colonel Joseph hendrickson?

556
01:02:50.357 --> 01:02:52.233
- Yeah.

557
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.237
- You got to
know, he's a legend here.

558
01:02:56.404 --> 01:02:59.490
I mean,
I heard stories about him, growing up.


559
01:03:01.242 --> 01:03:04.245
They say he was fearless.

560
01:03:04.412 --> 01:03:08.457
- He never backed down from anyone.
- So, then, how could he commit suicide?


561
01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:10.793
- He killed himself?

562
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.628
- That's the official verdict.

563
01:03:12.796 --> 01:03:15.256
His ship exploded on re-entry to earth.

564
01:03:15.423 --> 01:03:17.341
They say he triggered the explosion.

565
01:03:18.426 --> 01:03:19.760
- There must have been a reason.

566
01:03:19.928 --> 01:03:22.305
- That's what I keep telling myself.

567
01:03:23.473 --> 01:03:24.474
- Hey. Hey.

568
01:03:27.102 --> 01:03:28.978
We are going to survive.

569
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.266
It's right there.

570
01:04:49.976 --> 01:04:52.979
There's an entrance
at the base of the complex.


571
01:04:53.813 --> 01:04:57.733
- Bronte, I'll take point.
- Cover me as we go down.


572
01:04:58.443 --> 01:04:59.777
- Okay. Come on.

573
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.800
- At least there's power down here.
- That's a good sign.


574
01:05:42.612 --> 01:05:44.280
- I saw you last night.

575
01:05:45.073 --> 01:05:47.909
Have you ever noticed he doesn't sleep?

576
01:05:48.076 --> 01:05:50.661
I've never...
I've never seen him sleep.


577
01:05:51.704 --> 01:05:53.789
Tell us why, guy!

578
01:05:53.957 --> 01:05:57.043
- When was the last time you slept?
- Give it a rest.


579
01:05:57.252 --> 01:05:59.504
- You don't sleep 'cause
you don't need to.


580
01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:02.215
- Let me go.
- Machines don't sleep.


581
01:06:02.382 --> 01:06:04.092
- Hannah, put the knife down.

582
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.096
- He's not like us.
- But you don't believe me.


583
01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:10.890
So I'm gonna have to show you.

584
01:06:11.057 --> 01:06:12.535
- No, Hannah,
you don't need to do this.


585
01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:15.770
- Please stop!
- This isn't about me! It's about him.


586
01:06:15.937 --> 01:06:17.563
- Sexton, what do I do?
- Take the shot.


587
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:20.149
- No, no!
- No, please don't!


588
01:06:29.534 --> 01:06:30.868
- Commander?

589
01:06:32.161 --> 01:06:34.621
- You... you've killed me?

590
01:06:40.587 --> 01:06:41.963
Unreal.

591
01:06:42.213 --> 01:06:44.506
- What have you done?
- What have you done?


592
01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:47.718
My god.

593
01:06:47.885 --> 01:06:50.971
It's blood. It's real human blood.
She's dead!


594
01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.933
- You thought she was a screamer.

595
01:06:56.894 --> 01:06:59.354
- She had a knife to your throat.
- Keep moving.


596
01:07:14.704 --> 01:07:16.914
- Schwartzy, we can't stay here.

597
01:07:17.749 --> 01:07:19.375
You can't help her.

598
01:07:23.129 --> 01:07:24.797
- I just need a moment.

599
01:07:58.247 --> 01:07:59.539
- Schwartz!

600
01:08:02.377 --> 01:08:03.795
She's taking too long.

601
01:08:05.463 --> 01:08:07.047
I'm going back.

602
01:08:08.132 --> 01:08:09.424
- Let's go.

603
01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:21.062
- Please, just make it fast.

604
01:08:39.205 --> 01:08:40.247
- Schwartz!

605
01:08:44.043 --> 01:08:45.210
' Go!

606
01:08:49.173 --> 01:08:50.799
- Now, move!
- Run!


607
01:08:50.967 --> 01:08:52.802
- Let's move! You got to both move!

608
01:08:52.969 --> 01:08:54.679
- Run!
- Now!


609
01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.683
- Run!

610
01:08:58.891 --> 01:09:00.100
- Now, move!

611
01:09:03.062 --> 01:09:05.773
- Hey! Come with me, now.
- Move!


612
01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:07.942
- Get out of the way, man!
- Come!


613
01:09:08.192 --> 01:09:09.912
- You wanna die like your friend
back there?


614
01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.613
- Hurry up!
- Get out of the way!


615
01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.616
- Whatever you do, don't stop.
- Come on!


616
01:09:16.826 --> 01:09:17.826
Move it!

617
01:09:17.952 --> 01:09:19.244
- Go! Go! Go!

618
01:09:32.675 --> 01:09:35.260
- Where are you taking us?
- Some place safe.


619
01:09:35.428 --> 01:09:37.763
- What is that thing on your wrist?
- My tab.


620
01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:40.265
It's a hell of a lot better than yours,
isn't it?


621
01:09:57.575 --> 01:10:00.744
Welcome to the station.
I'm Eugene orsow.


622
01:10:04.874 --> 01:10:06.834
I am sorry about your friend.

623
01:10:08.211 --> 01:10:10.421
I've lost a lot of friends
to the screamers.


624
01:10:11.756 --> 01:10:13.507
Where are you all from'?

625
01:10:13.674 --> 01:10:15.467
- Earth.
- You came here from earth?


626
01:10:15.635 --> 01:10:18.846
- We received an sos transmission
from Sirius 6b.


627
01:10:19.013 --> 01:10:20.764
Our mission was put together to come here

628
01:10:20.932 --> 01:10:22.391
to rescue survivors.

629
01:10:22.558 --> 01:10:25.185
- Screamers got onto our ship.
- Drained our fuel cells.


630
01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:28.773
- We have to find replacements.
- Or we'll all be dead.


631
01:10:29.899 --> 01:10:33.819
Within 24 hours, this planet is gonna
get hit with a class 10 magellanic storm.


632
01:10:34.612 --> 01:10:35.821
- Which is why you're here.

633
01:10:35.988 --> 01:10:37.948
'Cause you have no fuel
to return to earth.


634
01:10:38.115 --> 01:10:41.660
Well, you've wasted your time,
because there are no fuel cells here,


635
01:10:41.828 --> 01:10:43.955
or anywhere else in this rotten core.

636
01:10:49.293 --> 01:10:50.836
I've seen you before.

637
01:10:51.003 --> 01:10:53.505
You were with those people in the mines.
How are they doing?


638
01:10:53.673 --> 01:10:55.091
- Not so good.

639
01:10:56.467 --> 01:10:59.803
Screamers got into our settlement.
Killed everyone.


640
01:11:00.513 --> 01:11:01.972
- Everyone but you.

641
01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:06.143
- I was lucky.
- How many were there?


642
01:11:07.728 --> 01:11:08.895
- A lot.

643
01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:14.151
- Then they'll be following you.
- They'll be coming here.


644
01:11:17.738 --> 01:11:21.074
Son of a bitch! 
They're on their way.

645
01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:31.502
The water tastes foul,
but it won't kill you.


646
01:11:36.382 --> 01:11:38.133
- What's your power source?

647
01:11:38.301 --> 01:11:41.971
- It's an old backup power grid
that wasn't bombed during the war.


648
01:11:42.138 --> 01:11:43.778
- You don't have any portable fuel cells?

649
01:11:43.806 --> 01:11:45.015
- I already told you.

650
01:11:45.725 --> 01:11:46.851
No.

651
01:12:01.616 --> 01:12:04.076
- So do you think
we can make it through this?


652
01:12:04.243 --> 01:12:05.744
- I don't know.

653
01:12:07.622 --> 01:12:09.874
There are a hell of
a lot of them coming.

654
01:12:10.041 --> 01:12:12.334
I hope these perimeter defenses hold.

655
01:12:12.501 --> 01:12:14.586
- Have you been attacked
by this many before?


656
01:12:14.754 --> 01:12:16.046
- No.

657
01:12:16.213 --> 01:12:18.548
I haven't seen this many
in a very long time.


658
01:12:18.716 --> 01:12:21.093
- We came across one of the factories
a couple of days ago.


659
01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.263
There were thousands of them in there.
I couldn't believe it.


660
01:12:24.722 --> 01:12:27.367
- Something must have happened
that activated the dormant screamers.


661
01:12:27.391 --> 01:12:29.559
It's the most I've ever seen.

662
01:12:33.981 --> 01:12:36.108
- How soon till they get here?

663
01:12:36.692 --> 01:12:39.236
- Two, maybe three hours.

664
01:13:04.345 --> 01:13:06.138
- I see you've been busy.

665
01:13:10.184 --> 01:13:13.645
These algorithms.
What are they worth back on earth?


666
01:13:16.273 --> 01:13:17.649
- They're unique.

667
01:13:20.861 --> 01:13:23.142
They're light years better than
the best designs on earth.


668
01:13:24.699 --> 01:13:26.450
- So they're a fortune?

669
01:13:27.785 --> 01:13:30.996
- The cross-application possibilities
are limitless.


670
01:13:41.298 --> 01:13:44.009
Progress is very expensive,
lieutenant.


671
01:13:45.302 --> 01:13:47.095
I was gonna cut you in.

672
01:13:52.184 --> 01:13:53.643
- Sorry, commander.

673
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.360
But I'm not for sale.

674
01:14:40.441 --> 01:14:41.608
- How are you?

675
01:14:43.027 --> 01:14:44.069
- Fine.

676
01:14:47.448 --> 01:14:48.866
You designed this?

677
01:14:49.033 --> 01:14:50.159
- Yes, I did.

678
01:14:52.161 --> 01:14:54.246
You look a lot like your father.

679
01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:58.959
- You knew him?
- Yeah.


680
01:14:59.168 --> 01:15:01.003
Joe hendrickson
was one of my best friends.


681
01:15:03.547 --> 01:15:05.423
He told me he wanted
to go back to earth


682
01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:07.884
and see what his daughter Victoria
looked like.


683
01:15:10.721 --> 01:15:12.097
How is Joe?

684
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:14.474
- Dead.

685
01:15:17.019 --> 01:15:20.981
Blew up his own ship on re-entry
to earth. They say it was suicide.


686
01:15:23.109 --> 01:15:26.112
- If Joe killed himself,
I promise you it wasn't suicide.


687
01:15:31.575 --> 01:15:32.784
Well...

688
01:15:35.287 --> 01:15:36.329
- What was he like?

689
01:15:36.497 --> 01:15:39.374
- Well, he was
a very complicated human being.


690
01:15:40.668 --> 01:15:42.628
We had a falling-out.

691
01:15:42.837 --> 01:15:44.213
- Over what?

692
01:15:45.506 --> 01:15:46.632
- Over what?

693
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.931
- The screamers.
- You designed these?


694
01:15:54.098 --> 01:15:55.390
- Invented them.

695
01:15:56.016 --> 01:15:57.517
It's my best work.

696
01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.187
There's only one reason

697
01:16:01.355 --> 01:16:04.733
that Joe hendrickson would blow up
his ship on re-entry.


698
01:16:05.317 --> 01:16:07.527
There must have been screamers
onboard.


699
01:16:10.489 --> 01:16:12.240
Here we go.

700
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:17.955
That's a hell of a lot of toasters.

701
01:16:18.122 --> 01:16:21.291
- How long until they get here?
- We're down to 30 minutes or less.


702
01:16:22.501 --> 01:16:23.668
- What the hell was that?

703
01:16:23.836 --> 01:16:27.589
- That grid gets a little finicky.
- It couldn't happen at a worse time.


704
01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.010
- What a pleasant surprise.
- You said you didn't have any fuel cells.


705
01:17:15.888 --> 01:17:17.931
You don't want us to go back home.

706
01:17:18.098 --> 01:17:19.516
- No, I don't.

707
01:17:36.325 --> 01:17:38.785
- We'll see how well your tab works,
old man.


708
01:17:47.795 --> 01:17:50.798
- What about your friends?
- They're not my friends.


709
01:17:58.889 --> 01:18:00.807
- The screamers are a plague.

710
01:18:01.558 --> 01:18:05.061
If you bring them to earth,
they'll destroy everything.


711
01:18:06.689 --> 01:18:09.191
- Warning. Power drain detected.

712
01:18:09.483 --> 01:18:10.901
- What the hell is that?

713
01:18:11.443 --> 01:18:14.070
- Outer wall breach is imminent.

714
01:18:14.238 --> 01:18:17.074
- You hear that? 
They're coming.

715
01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:19.576
I'm not gonna let you,
not gonna let you.


716
01:18:19.743 --> 01:18:22.912
- Automatic self-destruct system
has been activated.


717
01:18:41.682 --> 01:18:45.310
- Security system failure.
- Inner wall breached.


718
01:18:46.312 --> 01:18:50.733
Station will self-destruct
in t minus three minutes.


719
01:18:57.281 --> 01:18:59.283
- Danielli?
- Hi, lieutenant.


720
01:19:01.827 --> 01:19:03.703
- How are you here?
- You're dead.


721
01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:05.664
- Do I look dead?
- Just hold it, buddy!


722
01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:07.580
- Tell him to put it down.

723
01:19:07.666 --> 01:19:10.251
- Get away from him, madd.
- Step back!


724
01:19:10.419 --> 01:19:12.796
Madd! Get away!

725
01:19:15.549 --> 01:19:16.633
Madd!

726
01:19:24.767 --> 01:19:25.809
Madd!

727
01:19:42.785 --> 01:19:44.745
- We got to go! We got to go!
- Now! Let's go!


728
01:19:44.953 --> 01:19:46.120
- Mack“!

729
01:19:46.288 --> 01:19:50.125
- Station will self-destruct
in t minus two minutes.


730
01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:51.292
- We got to go!

731
01:19:58.133 --> 01:19:59.425
- Danielli?

732
01:20:02.846 --> 01:20:03.846
- Commander?

733
01:20:03.931 --> 01:20:05.766
- This isn't right.

734
01:20:06.642 --> 01:20:08.310
I saw you get killed.

735
01:20:12.564 --> 01:20:14.107
No!

736
01:20:16.652 --> 01:20:17.694
No!

737
01:20:17.861 --> 01:20:19.737
- Guy?
- What?


738
01:20:19.905 --> 01:20:21.698
- I got to go back.

739
01:20:21.865 --> 01:20:22.865
I'm going back.

740
01:20:29.957 --> 01:20:31.041
- Hey!

741
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:46.010
- Station will self-destruct
in t minus one minute.


742
01:20:47.182 --> 01:20:49.809
- Bronte. Bronte.

743
01:20:52.896 --> 01:20:54.105
Take it.

744
01:20:57.526 --> 01:20:58.777
Take it.

745
01:21:03.991 --> 01:21:05.367
- Okay, let's go.

746
01:21:15.586 --> 01:21:16.712
Go!

747
01:21:18.005 --> 01:21:19.256
- Let's go!

748
01:21:20.174 --> 01:21:24.674
- Station will self-destruct
in t minus 30 seconds.


749
01:21:29.308 --> 01:21:30.726
- Go! Go!

750
01:21:50.954 --> 01:21:52.789
- Danielli was different than the others.

751
01:21:52.956 --> 01:21:54.499
- Different how?

752
01:21:54.666 --> 01:21:58.628
- They found a way to integrate
biochemical devices into humans.


753
01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:00.672
- Implants.

754
01:22:02.674 --> 01:22:06.302
If they're using implants,
then the newest varieties are hybrids.


755
01:22:07.721 --> 01:22:08.930
- Hybrids.

756
01:22:09.097 --> 01:22:11.849
- Half-man, half-machine.

757
01:22:17.481 --> 01:22:18.732
- The storm's coming.

758
01:22:18.899 --> 01:22:20.108
Let's go.

759
01:22:35.958 --> 01:22:37.376
There it is.

760
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:44.150
It looks like we've got just enough time
to replace the fuel cells,


761
01:22:44.174 --> 01:22:46.801
get the systems online. Let's go.

762
01:23:06.029 --> 01:23:07.071
- What?

763
01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.427
- Hey, welcome aboard.

764
01:23:28.594 --> 01:23:29.720
- Don't move!

765
01:23:29.886 --> 01:23:33.014
- Now, now, there's no need
for violence.


766
01:23:33.181 --> 01:23:35.016
We all want the same thing.

767
01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.935
- Don't come any closer.

768
01:23:38.812 --> 01:23:40.480
I said don't come any closer!

769
01:23:40.897 --> 01:23:41.939
Stop!

770
01:24:06.798 --> 01:24:09.217
- Now, is that any way to treat
an old friend?


771
01:24:10.469 --> 01:24:12.387
We are still friends, aren't we?

772
01:24:15.307 --> 01:24:17.726
You want to know a little secret?

773
01:24:18.352 --> 01:24:20.604
When this happens,
not all of you dies.


774
01:24:22.356 --> 01:24:25.650
There's still a part of me in here.
The rational part.


775
01:24:26.777 --> 01:24:29.613
The rest is all useless crap anyway.

776
01:24:31.782 --> 01:24:33.822
You know, we could've killed you
easily, lieutenant.


777
01:24:33.909 --> 01:24:36.077
We still can, for that matter.

778
01:24:36.244 --> 01:24:38.996
But we're not going to.
You know why?


779
01:24:40.207 --> 01:24:44.461
Because killing is wasteful.
So join us, lieutenant.


780
01:24:46.546 --> 01:24:49.340
- You want me to be like you?
- It's evolution, baby.


781
01:24:51.051 --> 01:24:55.305
Survival of the fittest.
And we are the fittest.


782
01:24:55.472 --> 01:24:57.098
- He's lying, bronte.

783
01:24:57.891 --> 01:25:00.894
You're only alive because
they need you.


784
01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:03.221
- You can't fly a ship without a pilot.
- That's a lie.


785
01:25:03.355 --> 01:25:06.483
- If they can't start the ship,
they can't get to earth.


786
01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:08.443
And that is all they want.

787
01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:11.738
- It's not about earth.
- It's about evolution.


788
01:25:11.905 --> 01:25:14.198
It's about starting a new race.

789
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:25.752
You know, we adapt pretty quickly.

790
01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:29.172
You're gonna have to try
a little harder than that.


791
01:25:37.681 --> 01:25:38.765
- Adapt to this!

792
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:12.757
Bronte.

793
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:15.009
Make this happen.

794
01:26:19.306 --> 01:26:20.682
Hey, here.

795
01:26:20.849 --> 01:26:21.849
- Got it.

796
01:26:28.148 --> 01:26:29.440
- What the hell is that?

797
01:26:29.608 --> 01:26:31.401
- It's the storm coming.
- We got to hurry.


798
01:26:33.695 --> 01:26:34.821
- We're good?

799
01:26:34.988 --> 01:26:36.656
- Good. Let's get
the hell out of here!

800
01:26:46.082 --> 01:26:47.666
- Emergency takeoff initiated.

801
01:26:56.635 --> 01:26:58.011
- Let's go!

802
01:27:11.608 --> 01:27:14.110
Okay. I'll see you in two months.

803
01:27:47.394 --> 01:27:49.479
- Reanimation is now complete.

804
01:27:55.318 --> 01:27:56.319
- Guy?

805
01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:59.906
Guy?

806
01:28:26.516 --> 01:28:28.476
- Hey.

807
01:28:29.978 --> 01:28:31.938
- Shhh.
- I'm sorry.


808
01:28:32.606 --> 01:28:33.648
I had a bad dream.

809
01:28:36.151 --> 01:28:38.444
- Looks like we're getting close.

810
01:28:43.116 --> 01:28:44.617
- Are you okay?

811
01:28:45.785 --> 01:28:46.785
- No.

812
01:28:48.038 --> 01:28:49.706
I feel nauseous.

813
01:28:50.373 --> 01:28:54.293
- Maybe it was the cryo sleep.

814
01:28:56.087 --> 01:28:57.797
- Yeah, I'm sure it'll pass.

815
01:28:59.591 --> 01:29:02.260
- We've been asleep two months.

816
01:29:03.261 --> 01:29:04.804
And you,

817
01:29:07.057 --> 01:29:08.725
you wake up nauseous?

818
01:29:20.403 --> 01:29:22.279
You're pregnant.

819
01:29:22.447 --> 01:29:23.448
- Yes.

820
01:29:25.450 --> 01:29:26.993
I'm pregnant.

821
01:29:31.331 --> 01:29:33.291
I just don't understand it.

822
01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:36.669
It's only been two months
and it's growing way too fast.


823
01:29:37.879 --> 01:29:41.048
- Whatever's happening,
we'll deal with it together.


824
01:29:44.636 --> 01:29:47.221
- I just can't believe this is happening.

825
01:29:48.264 --> 01:29:49.556
- No, it's okay.

826
01:29:53.395 --> 01:29:54.521
It's okay.

827
01:29:58.525 --> 01:30:00.109
He's our first.

828
01:30:02.237 --> 01:30:04.530
And there won't be anyone like him.

829
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:07.283
Even

830
01:30:12.122 --> 01:30:13.790
- no! No! No! No! No!
