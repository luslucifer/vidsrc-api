THE GIANT PANDA IS THE MOST
FAMOUS ANIMAL IN THE WORLD.

00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:48.703
THE PANDAS LIVE
IN THE FORESTS OF CHINA,


6
00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:51.296
AND BECAUSE THE FORESTS
ARE DISAPPEARING,


7
00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.199
SO IS THE PANDA.

8
00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:55.768
TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER

9

THAN 1,000 PANDAS
LEFT IN THE WORLD,


10
00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.579
BUT THE BIGGEST THREAT
TO THEIR EXTINCTION


11
00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:05.606
IS THAT PEOPLE
JUST DON'T CARE.


12
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:11.391
AND THAT'S WHAT MY DAD
DOES FOR A LIVING.

FIGHTING OFF THE LIONS


14

AND THE POACHERS


15
00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:19.927

JUST LIKE INDIANA JONES,


16
00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:21.697
AND THAT'S WHY
HE'S NOT HERE,


17
00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:24.925
