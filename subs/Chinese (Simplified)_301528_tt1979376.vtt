我很担心邦妮

202
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.750
应该有个玩具陪她去迎新会
A toy should go with her to orientation.


203
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.960
你没听到爸爸说的吗  你会害邦妮惹麻烦的
Didn't you hear Dad? You'll get Bonnie in trouble.


204
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.880
是啊  但幼儿园很不一样
Yeah, but kindergarten is so different.


205
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.460
小孩可能觉得吃不消
It can be too much for a kid.


206
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.770
如果能有个伙伴陪着渡过难关
Having a buddy with them to get through it


207
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.800
会很有帮助的

208
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.880
我记得以前我就会和安迪一起去上学...
I remember with Andy, I would go to school with him...


209
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.910
抱歉  胡迪  我也不想像复读机一样唠叨
I'm sorry, Woody. I hate to sound like a broken record.


210
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.300
但邦妮不是安迪
But Bonnie is not Andy.


211
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.970
对对对  当然了  我明白
No, no, no, of course, I get that.


212
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.460
-但如果你能...  -大家就位
- But if you would just... - Places, everyone!


213
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.310
邦妮
Bonnie?


214
00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.940
你躲在这里做什么
What are you doing back there?


215
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.600
快点  我们必须走了

219
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.910
会很好玩的
You're gonna have so much fun.


220
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.250
好了  你说到哪了  胡迪
All right. Now what was it you were saying, Woody?


221
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.580
胡迪
Woody?


222
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.090

上学的第一天

你们都需要有个地方来放铅笔

不  今天只是迎新会

251
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.750
但你这么勇敢

我们要给你个惊喜

253
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.710
什么惊喜
What is it?


254
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.540
既然还有一周才开学
Since school doesn't start for another week,


255
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.840
那我们就来个自驾游

他们还说我不该跟邦妮去学校
And they said I shouldn't go to school with Bonnie.


259
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.550
幼儿园的情况尽在我们掌控之中  对吧
We got this kindergarten thing under control, eh?


260
00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.050
不敢相信我居然在跟叉勺说话
I can't believe I'm talking to a spork.


261
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.240

胡迪  我有个问题

299
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.070
实际上  不止一个问题

302
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.450
他为什么要去垃圾桶那儿
Why does he want to go to the trash?


303
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.360
-因为他是用垃圾做的  -垃圾
- Because he was made from trash. - Trash!


304
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.490
听着  我知道这有点奇怪
Look, I know this is a little strange, but


305
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.080
-但你们要相信我  -垃圾
- you got to trust me on this. - Trash?


306
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.700
叉叉现在是

307
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.580
邦妮心目中最重要的玩具
most important toy to Bonnie right now.


308
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.500
重要
Important?


309
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.370
他是个叉勺
He's a spork.


310
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.500
是的  没错  我知道  但这个叉勺
Yes. Yeah, I know, but this spork...


311
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.710
这个玩具是邦妮适应
this toy is crucial to Bonnie


312
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.740
幼儿园生活的关键
getting adjusted to kindergarten.


313
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.420
胡迪  你这样是不是太小题大做了
Woody, aren't you being a little dramatic about all this?


314
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.970
我知道大家有点不适应
I know this is new to everybody...


315
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.050
但你们应该明白这个小家伙
but you should see how much


316
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.970
对于邦妮来说意义非凡
this little guy means to Bonnie.


317
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.430
当她开始跟他玩时
When she started playing with him...


318
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.730
她脸上的笑容是有史以来最灿烂的
she had the biggest smile on her face.


319
00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.020
要是你们能看到就好了
I wish you could have seen it.


320
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.230
邦妮当时真的很难过
Bonnie was really upset...


321
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.980
我发誓  她做好叉叉之后
and I swear, once she made Forky...


322
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.340
就完全变了个人
it was a complete transformation.


323
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.780
-胡迪  -稍等  杰西
- Woody? - Just a second, Jessie.


324
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.030
所以我们都要确保他平安无事
So, we all have to make sure nothing happens to him.


325
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.600
他已经有事了
Something happened to him.


326
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.680
要了老命了
Chutes and Ladders!


327
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.790
-垃圾  -不不不
- Trash. - No, no, no! No! No!


328
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.250
你现在是玩具了  叉叉  别这样
You're a toy now, Forky! Come on!


329
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.560
住手  停下
Stop! Stop it!


330
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.370
-不不不  别这样  -垃圾
- No, no, no! Come on! - Trash!


331
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.580
垃圾  垃圾
Trash! Trash!


332
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.670
好吧  我只能一直看着他
Well, I guess I'll just babysit him


333
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.110
直到他习惯这个房间
till he's used to the room.


334
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.330
叉叉
Forky?


335
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.120
你在哪里  叉叉

你在这里
There you are!


337
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.420
我以为我把你弄丢了  小傻瓜
I thought I'd lost you, silly.


338
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.220
不不不
No, no, no.


339

大孩子好可怕
Big girl scary!


340
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.120
我告诉过你  邦妮一点都不可怕
Like I said before, Bonnie's not scary.


341
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.110
她爱你  而且你得...

太阳晒屁股了
Rise and shine!


346

谁想去自驾游
Who wants to go on a road trip?


347

348
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.760
还有叉叉  还有...

349
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.680
叉叉  你在哪里

他还真难对付  胡迪
He's quite a handful, Woody.


356

自驾游路上你需要帮忙吗

也许还有辣椒酱  最后沦为垃圾的

我为什么一定要做玩具
Why do I have to be a toy?


453
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.060
因为你的木棍底下
Because you have Bonnie's name


454
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.850
写着邦妮的名字
written on the bottom of your sticks.


455
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.020
为什么我的木棍底下
Why do I have Bonnie's name


456
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.550
写着邦妮的名字
written on the bottom of my sticks?


457
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.800
因为她...
Because she...


458
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.430
她经常和你一起玩  对不对
Look, she plays with you all the time, right?


459

461
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.200
那个大大白白软软的东西

You.


464
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.080
好了  叉叉
All right, Forky.


465
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.690
你要明白自己现在有多幸运
You have to understand how lucky you are right now.


466
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.340
你是邦妮的玩具

467
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.670
你要和她共创欢乐美好的回忆
You are going to help create happy memories...


468
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.370
她的余生都将对此回味无穷
that will last for the rest of her life.


469
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.450
你说什么
What?


470
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.050
我这是为了邦妮

就算你不喜欢做玩具
Maybe you don't like being one,


474
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.900
你也注定是个玩具
but you are one nonetheless.


475
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.300
也就是说  在安迪需要你的时候...
Which means you are going to be there for Andy when he...


476
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.300
安迪是谁

477

482
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.770
-抱我走  -不要
- Carry me - No.


483
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.900
安迪是谁
Who's Andy?


484
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.860
安迪曾经是我的孩子
Andy was my other kid.


485
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.870
你还有其他孩子
You had another kid?


486
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.300
对啊  对啊
Yeah, yeah.


487
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.790
很长一段时间
For a long time.


488
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.000
一段美好的时光
And it was pretty great.


489
00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.000
我还是他最喜欢的玩具  不瞒你说
I was a favorite toy, actually.


490
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.630
我的职责就是统领全局
Running the room was my job.


491
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.150
让所有的玩具恪尽职守
Keeping all the toys in place...


492
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.340
他觉得安迪的房间是颗星球
So, he thought Andy's room was a planet?


493
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.530
-真是够蠢的  -可不是吗
- That is messed up. - Right!


494
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.400
他登场的时候我就是这么想的
That's exactly what I thought when he first showed up.


495
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.160
是啊  你们不会觉得他很烦人吗
Yeah. I mean, how is that not annoying?


496
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.450
-谢谢支持  -说真的  这也太...
- Thank you! - Seriously, that is the...


497
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.040
看着孩子们渐渐长大
Well, then you watch 'em grow up


498
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.100
然后长大成人
and become a full person.


499
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.360
最终离我们而去
And then they leave.


500
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.110
他们会离开去做你永远见不到的事情
They go off and do things you'll never see.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.100
别误会  你仍然会为他们感到自豪
Don't get me wrong, you still feel good about it.


502
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.810
但终有一日你会发现
But then somehow you find yourself,


503
00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.310
这么多年以来
after all those years...


504
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.760
守在壁橱里  感觉自己...
sitting in a closet just feeling...


505
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:15.640
百无一用
Useless?


506
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.220
对
Yeah.


507
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.180
你的任务已经完成
Your purpose fulfilled?


508
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.890
没错
Exactly.


509
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.560
胡迪  我知道你的问题在哪了
Woody, I know what your problem is.


510
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.280
你知道
You do?


511
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.690
你和我一样
You're just like me.


512
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.200
垃圾一个
Trash!


513
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.120
你到底和垃圾有什么不解之缘
What is it with you and trash?


514
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.540
-很温暖  -恶心
- It's warm. - Ew.


515
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.960
-很温馨  -可能吧
- It's cozy. - I guess.


516
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.920
充满安全感
And safe!


517
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.750
仿佛有人在你耳边轻声说道
Like somebody's whispering in your ear,


518
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.780
"一切都会好起来的"
"Everything's gonna be okay."


519
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.950
叉叉  就是这样
Forky, that's it.


520
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.930
邦妮和你在一起的时候就是这种感觉
That's how Bonnie feels when she's with you.


521
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.660
-是吗  -没错
- She does - Yes!


522
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:47.790
让我想想
Wait a sec.


523
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.140
-你是说她觉得我很温暖  -对
- You mean she thinks I'm warm? - Yep.


524
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.480
-很温馨  -没错
- And cozy - Uh-huh.


525
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.840
有时候还黏糊糊的
And sometimes kinda squishy?


526
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.550
这个嘛  对  没错
Well, that, too. Yes.


527
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.180
我现在懂了
I get it now.


528
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.400
我是邦妮的"垃圾"
I'm Bonnie's trash.


529
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.530
对  等等  你说什么
Yes! Wait, what?


530
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.940
我是邦妮的"垃圾"
I am Bonnie's trash!


531
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.740
不  不  不  不至于
No, no, no, not exactly.


532
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.240
我不在她一定很伤心
She must be feeling awful without me.


533
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.020
胡迪  快走  她需要我
Woody, we got to get going, she needs me!

我们的孩子创造了他
Our kid made him.


588
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.490
孩子  这里的玩具都没有孩子
Kid? Toys around here don't have kids.


589
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.910
你们两个是不是被弄丢了
Are you two lost?


590
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.760
弄丢了  没有  没有
Lost No, no.

我们在找一个被弄丢的玩具
But we are looking for a lost toy.


592

她是小塑像  曾经在展示窗的那盏灯上
She's a figurine. Used to be on that lamp in the window?

Well, okay.


599

602
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.710
我已经很多年没见过宝贝了
I haven't seen Bo in years.


603
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.530
冒昧问一句  你产于哪一年
May I ask, when were you made?


604
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.360
我吗
Me?


605
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.910
我不确定  50年代末
I'm not sure. Late '50s?


606
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.780
我也是
Me, too!


607
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.010
老天  我们会不会是同一家工厂生产的
Gee, I wonder if we were made in the same factory.


608
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.410
那样是不是太了不起了
Wouldn't that be something?


609
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.050
不得不说  你护理得非常棒
I got to say, you are in great condition.


610
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.120
我尽量保持活跃
Well, I try to stay active.


611
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.420
而且你看
And look at that,


612
00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.170
你和我一样有个声匣
you have a voice box like me.


613
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.380
本森  给他看看
Benson, show him.


614
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.260
这就不必了
That's really not necessary.


615
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.100
我叫嘉比嘉比
I'm Gabby Gabby

You need to fix that.


618
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.640
我的录音带是好的
My record works just fine.


619
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.850
是声匣坏了
It's the voice box that's broken.


620
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.400
你的还能用吗
Does yours still work?


621
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.980
我靴子里有条蛇
There's a snake in my boot!


622
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.210
听听这声音  让我看看
Listen to that! Let's see it.


623
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.290
肯定和我是同款
I bet it's the same type.


624
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.360
不用了谢谢  我的缝在体内了
No, thanks, mine's sewn inside.


625
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.450
宝贝在这里吗  我们还得...

Don't worry, we'll take you where no one will see us.


628
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.130
不行  我们不能逗留
Oh, no. We can't stay.


629
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.960
你们当然可以
Yes, you can.


630
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.360
我们该走了
We got to go.


631
00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.180
你还不能离开  你身上有我需要的东西
You can't leave yet. You have what I need.


632
00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.900
就在你身体里面
Right inside there.


633
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.370
第二天就把台灯退回来了
Returned that lamp the next day.


634
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.160
你在开玩笑吗
You're kidding me!


635
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.160
妈妈  我们能去公园了吗
Mom, can we go to the park now?


636
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.190
哈莫妮

Stop him, please.


638
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.250
怎么回事
What's going on?


639

宝贝  我得回到我的孩子身边去

干得好  士兵

游乐场见  牧羊女
Meet you at the playground, Peep.


792
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.620
战斗兵卡尔要闯入彩罐玩偶派对
Combat Carl's got a pinata party to crash.


793
00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.400

All right, move out. Hut! Hut! Hut!


794
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.780
你现在有孩子
So, you're, uh, with a kid?


795
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:49.960
不是安迪吧
It's not Andy, is it?


796
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.960
不是  不是  他去上大学了
No, no, no. He went off to college.


797
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.450
但他把我们给了邦妮
But he gave us to Bonnie.


798
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.930
-你有个小姑娘  -不可能
- You have a little girl. - No way!


799
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.550
对  所以我才在这里

800
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.760
她的一个玩具
Her other toy is trapped


801
00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.260
被困在古董店里了  我得去...
in this antique store, and I have to...


802
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.090
第二机会古董店
Second Chance Antiques?


803
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.430
我们认识那家店
We know that store.


804
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.100
那真好  真棒
That's great. That is great!


805
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.600
你认识那家店的话

806
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.720
-就可以帮我找到他  -没门
- help me find him... - No way.


807
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.900
我们在那家店里浪费了很多年
We wasted years there,


808
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.010
待在架子上  堆积灰尘
just sitting on the shelf, collecting dust.


809
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.300
宝贝  那真糟糕
Bo, that's awful.


810
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.720
但我别无选择
But I don't have a choice.


811
00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.470
我得从嘉比那里救回那件玩具
I have to get that toy from Gabby.


812
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.240
离那个怪胎远点
Steer clear of that weirdo.


813
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.490
如果我是你  我就认命回家去
If I were you, I'd cut my losses and go home.


814
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.700
但邦妮上幼儿园还需要他
But Bonnie needs him to get through kindergarten.


815
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.040
天天都有小孩弄丢玩具  邦妮会克服的
Kids lose toys every day. Bonnie will get over it.


816
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.650
不不
No, no...


817
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.150
邦妮需要他  就像莫莉需要你
You see, Bonnie needs him just like Molly needed you.


818
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.250
不  抱歉  姑娘们
No. Sorry, girls.


819
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.580
莫莉不在这里
Molly's not here.


820
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.970
莫莉  宝贝  我不知道你曾有过孩子
Molly Bo, I didn't know you had a kid.


821
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.330
那是很久之前了
That was a long time ago.


822
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.000
宝贝的孩子很特别
Bo's kid was something special.


823
00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.930
她非常可爱
She was the cutest thing...


824
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.090
但很怕黑
but so afraid of the dark.


825
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.560
那只是成长的一个阶段
It was just a phase.


826
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.100
最开始没有你
You weren't there in the beginning.


827
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.880
听着莫莉每晚哭泣
Hearing Molly cry each night...


828
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.090
每个玩具都为此心碎
it broke every toy's heart.


829
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.600
然后  宝贝来了
And then, Bo came into the room.


830
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.850
只有她的台灯能让莫莉感到安全
Her lamp was the only thing that made Molly feel safe.


831
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.740
妈妈会让她整晚开着宝贝的灯
Mom would let her keep Bo on all night.


832
00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.910
谁猜得出你曾经那么温柔呢
Ha! Who knew you were such a softy?


833
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.160
莫莉会握着
And Molly would fall asleep


834
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.540
宝贝的脚入睡
with her hand resting on Bo's feet.


835
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.900
好了  好了  我知道了
Okay! Okay. I get it.


836
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.910
宝贝  我的孩子真的很需要这个玩具
Bo, my kid really needs this toy.


837
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.450
你能看在旧情的份上帮帮我吗
Will you help me? For old times' sake.


838
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.800
好吧  好吧

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.030
好了  爸爸需要飚几句话
Okay! Daddy's going to use some words.


1052
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.700
不如我们去嘉年华玩吧
How about we go to the carnival?


1053
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.730
或者在镇子上的商店里转转
Or maybe check out some of those shops in town?


1054
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.750
你干什么了
What did you do?


1055
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:13.200
我们哪都去不了了
We're not going anywhere.


1056
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.710
如果你们懂我的意思[尖]
If you get my point.


1057
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.170
-太棒了  -天才
- Brilliant! - That was genius!


1058
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.250
干得漂亮  杰西
Nice work, Jessie!


1059
00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.910
巴斯和胡迪一定已经在回来的路上了
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on their way back right now.


1060
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.040
叉叉在那里吗
Forky is in there?


1061
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:26.750
对
Yeah.


1062
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.170
等等  我有个问题
Now, hold on. I have a question.


1063
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:31.140
邦妮会更喜欢谁  小鸭还是我  说我
Who will Bonnie love more? Ducky or me. Say me.


1064
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.560
-不  说小鸭  小鸭  -小兔  小兔
- No, say Ducky. Ducky. - Bunny. Bunny.


1065
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.850
好了伙计们  胡闹的时间结束了
Okay, guys. Playtime is over.


1066
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.300
你们都要听我指挥
You have to follow my lead.


1067
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.360
我们待在一起  保持安静  听懂了吗
We stay together, we stay quiet. Are we clear?


1068
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.810
懂了  带路吧
Absolutely. Lead the way.


1069
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.010
-逗我呢吧  -过去点
- Are you kidding me. - Move over.


1070
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.550
-你过去点  -别推我了
- You move over. - Quit pushing me.


1071
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:05.210
别闹了
Stop.


1072
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.190
我的老天  这只羊有三个头
Oh, my maker! That sheep has three heads!


1073
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.810
不不不
No, no, no!


1074
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.480
这六只小眼睛看穿了我的灵魂
What all six eyes just looked into my soul.


1075
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.860
要做噩梦了
Gonna have nightmares.


1076
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.660
你的叉叉应该就是被关在那里了
That's most likely where your Forky is being kept.


1077
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.330
好吧  还不算太糟
All right, this isn't so bad.


1078
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.370
只要避免被那些假人看到就行
We just can't be seen by the dummies.


1079
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.750
不光是那些假人
Not just the dummies.


1080
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:29.460
她的橱柜被毫无遮拦的过道环绕
Her cabinet is surrounded by a moat of exposed aisle.


1081
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.590
还有恶龙出没
Where Dragon roams.


1082
00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.050
-猫我们能应付  -不
- We can handle a cat. - No.


1083
00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.170
不是这只
Not this one.


1084
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.060
我们的体内就是那样的吗
Is that how we look on the inside?


1085
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.100
有好多...绒毛
There's so much... fluff.


1086
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.600
那你觉得我们应该怎么过去
So, how do you propose we get up there?


1087
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.890
我们可以直接穿过去
We could go straight across.


1088
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.650
-怎么做  -这要跳好远
- How. - That's quite a jump.


1089
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.980
我们认识最合适的玩具帮手
We know the perfect toy to help.


1090
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:53.020
邦妮  快来看
Bonnie, check it out.


1091
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.110
-看看这些好玩的东西  -邦妮
- Look at all this cool stuff. - Bonnie?


1092
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.700
我们要立刻找到叉叉
We got to get Forky now!


1093
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.650
胡迪  别...
Woody, don't...


1094
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:59.410
-按计划执行  -收到
- Stick to the plan. - 10-4.


1095
00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:00.950
-跟我来  -收到
- Follow me. - Roger that.


1096
00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.040
胡迪只能待在壁橱里  没机会玩耍吗
Woody just sits in the closet? With no playtime?


1097
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.420
对  他自己告诉我的  他没用了
Yeah, he told me himself, he's useless.


1098
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.460
太可怜了
That's awful.


1099
00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.340
头发真好看
Such pretty hair...


1100
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:15.960
你在干什么
What are you doing?


1101
00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:17.050
你得按计划行事
You need to stick to the plan.


1102
00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.800
但那可是邦妮  她就在...
But it's Bonnie. She's right...


1103
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.590
我们能接着去嘉年华吗
Can we go to the carnival, too?


1104
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.300
那儿
There.


1105
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.760
走吧  不要出声
Come on. Stay quiet.


1106
00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:25.770
你最好祈祷那些假人没有...
You better hope the dummies didn't...


1107
00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.180
我的羊
My sheep!


1108
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.810
我怎么说得来着  我带路  你跟着
What did I say? I lead. You follow.


1109
00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.520
宝贝  我十分抱歉
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.


1110
00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:17.650
快告诉我该怎么帮你
Just tell me how to help.


1111
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:18.490
你真的想要帮忙吗
You really wanna help?


1112
00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:21.450
别挡着我的路  我要把羊找回来
Then stay out of my way. I'm getting my sheep back.


1113
00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:22.360
那其他人呢
What about the others?


1114
00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.030
笑笑知道该怎么做
Giggle knows what to do.


1115
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:29.330
-你看  -那就是我们的目标
- Here you go. - That's our objective.


1116
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.870
我们必须拿到那把钥匙
We have to get that key.


1117
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:32.710
这是进入橱柜唯一的办法
It's the only way inside the cabinet.


1118
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:34.170
你没开玩笑吧
You can't be serious.


1119
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.840
我们怎么可能做得到
How are we supposed to do that?


1120
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.750
行吧
Okay.


1121
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.210
你知道吗  交给我们吧
You know what, leave that to us.


1122
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.050
我们很清楚该怎么做
We know exactly what to do.


1123
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.510
你们两个是从哪来的
Where did you two come from?


1124
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.600
钥匙  快给我们  放在哪了
The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they?


1125
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.890
把钥匙给我们  把钥匙给我们
Give us the keys! Give us the keys!


1126
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.980
这个...不能这么办
Well, we're not doing that.


1127
00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.310
对  我也同意  太显眼了
Yeah, yeah, I agree, too visible.


1128
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:54.100
你的观点不错  想个妙一点的
It's a good point. Something more subtle.


1129
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.650
不如就用"大吉大利  今晚吃鸡"
What about "winner, winner, chicken dinner"?


1130
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:56.570
好
Yes.


1131
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.820
钥匙  快给我们  放在哪了
The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they?


1132
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.330
-开玩笑呢吧  -不是吧
- You're kidding. - Really?


1133
00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:08.990
行吧  行吧  你真是
Okay, okay. You just...


1134
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.290
行吧  那个
All right. Well...


1135
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:12.410
不如用那个老方法  "毛绒突袭"
What about the old "Plush Rush"?


1136
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:13.540
就这么办
There you go!


1137
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:29.060
-扯到哪去了  -别打岔
- Where is this going? - Don't interrupt.


1138
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.070
还行  对吧
Okay, right?


1139
00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.320
不可能  不...行
Not gonna happen. N-O.


1140
00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.490
行吧  你到底想不想要钥匙
Okay, do you want the key or not?


1141
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.370
你们到底什么毛病
What is wrong with you?


1142
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:51.160
我们有什么...
What is wrong with...?


1143
00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.580
我们刚刚提了三个绝妙的点子
We just gave you three brilliant ideas.


1144
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.870
拒绝是一回事
It's one thing to say no.


1145
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.620
说出原因又是另一回事
It's another to offer a reason...


1146
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:58.590
我们怎样才能拿到那把钥匙
How do we get that key?


1147
00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.880
没开玩笑吧
You're kidding!


1148
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:07.800
真的吗
Really?


1149
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.050
胡迪回来了
Woody's back?


1150
00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:09.970
胡迪回来了
Woody's back?


1151
00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.930
你确定牧羊女宝贝和他一起来的
And you're sure it's Bo Peep who's with him?


1152
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.810
谢谢你  本森
Thank you, Benson.


1153
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.480
去让其他人准备好
Make sure the others are ready.


1154
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.150
胡迪回来了
Woody's back!


1155
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:21.020
我来了  邦妮
I'm coming, Bonnie!


1156
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.110
邦妮
Bonnie.


1157
00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:25.400
首先  我们要为他的到来做好准备
First, we must prepare for his arrival.


1158
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:25.990
准备
Prepare?


1159
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:27.950
你玩过捉迷藏吗
Have you ever played hide-and-seek?


1160
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:30.450
没有  但是听起来很复杂
No. But it sounds complicated.


1161
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:31.120
很简单
It's easy.


1162
00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.870
-我来教你好吗  -好
- I'll teach you, okay? - Okay.


1163
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:34.620
第一件事就是
The first thing you do is...


1164
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.250
-我们其中一人找地方藏起来  -吓人
- one of us finds a place to hide... - Scary.


1165
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.540
另一个人...
the other one...


1166
00:54:58.940 --> 00:54:59.900
我们在做什么
What are we doing.


1167
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:03.860
你就站在那边别出声
Just stand there and be quiet!


1168
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.780
我来负责讲话
I'll do the talking.


1169
00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:12.950
你好  锡兵
Hi, Tinny!


1170
00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:15.410
我也很高兴见到你
Nice to see you, too.


1171
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:17.750
对  他和我一起的
Yeah, he's with me.


1172
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:19.620
我的朋友  不不不
My friend? No, no, no.


1173
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.170
他是我的随从
He's my accessory.


1174
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.670
-你们好啊  -宝贝
- Hey, guys. - Bo!


1175
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.550
好久不见
Long time no see.


1176
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.300
受不了外面的世界吧
Couldn't take it out there, huh?


1177
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.880
道格  我看到你的半身
Hey, Doug. Saw your better half


1178
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:29.970
躺在店前面了
at the front of the store.


1179
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:32.180
和猫瞎闹  只能挨挠
Yeah, you mess with the cat, you get the claws.


1180
00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.220
宝贝回来了
Bo came back!


1181
00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:34.560
魔力八号球说得对
Magic 8-Ball was right!


1182
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.770
-借过  抱歉  -你怎么在这
- Excuse me. Sorry. - What are you doing here?


1183
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:39.100
这家店应该不提供退货服务吧
I thought the store had no return policy!


1184
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.230
宝贝帮帮我
Bo, help me out.


1185
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:41.650
我需要电池
I need a battery.


1186
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.650
我们得让车队行动起来
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!


1187
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.150
-同意  -帮我  帮我  帮我
- Agreed. - Help, help, help.


1188
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.110
作弊
Cheater.


1189
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.360
你见到公爵了吗
Have you seen Duke?


1190
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.990
他在后面
He's in the back.


1191
00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.750
看看这是谁跳了四十回校车
Look who jumped 40 school buses


1192
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.460
又落回了我的生活里
and landed back into my life.


1193
00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.500
-你好  公爵  -这个牛仔是哪位
- Hi, Duke! - Who's the cowboy?


1194
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.630
公爵  这位是胡迪  胡迪  这位是...
Duke, meet Woody. Woody, meet...


1195
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:08.470
咔嘣公爵  加拿大最出色的特技演员
Duke Caboom. Canada's greatest stuntman.


1196
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:09.970
没错
Oh, yeah!


1197
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.760
他在摆造型
He's posing.


1198
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:15.760
公爵
Duke?


1199
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:17.890
-公爵  我们需要...  -等等  还有一个
- Duke, we need to... - Hold on. One more.


1200
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.640
对了  你怎么回来了  牧羊女
Yeah! What brings you back, Peep?


1201
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.690
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.


1202
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:24.980
嘉比嘉比抓走了他的玩具还有我的羊
Gabby Gabby has his toy and my sheep.


1203
00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.070
不会吧  比利  小羊  怪叫
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?


1204
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:28.610
她们可是我的好姑娘
Those are my girls.


1205
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.110
你怎么和嘉比嘉比搅和到一起了
What were you doing getting tangled up with Gabby Gabby?


1206
00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:31.780
你可是个明白人
You know better.


1207
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.320
对  某些玩具觉得大摇大摆走上过道
Yeah, some toy thought it would be a good idea...


1208
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.620
是个好主意
to wander into the aisle.


1209
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.120
完全讲不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.


1210
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.160
讲不通  对吧
It doesn't, does it?


1211
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.830
所有人都知道最佳路线在橱柜后面
Everybody knows the best route is behind the shelves.


1212
00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:43.500
那本应该是更好的路线  对吧
That would have been a better route, wouldn't it?


1213
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.130
这个玩具听起来就是个彻头彻尾的白痴
This toy sounds like a complete idiot.


1214
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.880
就是
He does!


1215
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:49.050
等等  你就是那个玩具吗
Wait, are you that toy?


1216
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:50.670
计划如下
So, here's the plan.


1217
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:53.380
我们需要跳过过道进入嘉比的橱柜
We need to jump over the aisle to Gabby's cabinet.


1218
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:56.350
-就由你这个玩具来完成  -不行
- And you are the toy to do it. - No.


1219
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.260
-公爵  -不行
- Duke. - Nope.


1220
00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.140
-公爵  -决不
- Duke. - Never.


1221
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:58.850
-公爵  -没门
- Duke. - No way.


1222
00:56:58.850 --> 00:56:59.560
-公爵  -不干
- Duke. - Pass.


1223
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.310
-公爵  -拒绝
- Duke. - Negative.


1224
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.560
-公爵  -反对
- Duke. - Rejected.


1225
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.810
求你了  咔嘣先生  这真的很重要
Please, Mr. Caboom, this is really important.


1226
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:04.810
我的孩子...
My kid...


1227
00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.270
你有孩子
You have a kid?


1228
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.400
公爵  再给我们摆几个造型吧  你觉得怎么样
Hey, Duke, show us some more poses, what do you say?


1229
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.490
-我也有过孩子  -不要啊
- I had a kid. - Oh, no.


1230
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.490
雷加
Rejean.


1231
00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.370
圣诞节后得到我的时候  雷加可开心了
Rejean was so excited when he got me after Christmas.


1232
00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.950
那是我一生中最快乐的节礼日
It was the happiest Boxing Day of my life.


1233
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:23.120
这是咔嘣公爵
That's Duke Caboom,


1234
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.750
骑着酷炫的咔嘣特技摩托
riding the amazing Caboom stunt cycle!


1235
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.040
咔嘣
Caboom!


1236
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.710
我终于准备要做命中注定要做的事了
I was ready to finally do what I was made to do.


1237
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:32.550
咔嘣
Caboom!


1238
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:34.430
但是等雷加意识到
But when Rejean realized I couldn't jump


1239
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:36.510
我不能跳得像广告里的玩具一样远...
as far as the toy in the commercial...


1240
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.430
那是广告  那不是真的
It's a commercial! It's not real!


1241
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:42.060
雷加把我丢弃了
Rejean threw me away!


1242
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.390
这不公平
It's not fair!


1243
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:45.310
为什么  雷加  为什么
Why, Rejean Why?


1244
00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:50.320
好了好了  冷静下来  公爵
Okay, okay. Calm down, Duke.


1245
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.150
那已经是很久以前了
That was a long time ago.


1246
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.360
现在  我们需要独一无二的玩具
Right now, we need the only toy


1247
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.200
只有他能带我们撞进嘉比的橱柜
who can crash us onto Gabby's cabinet.


1248
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:57.910
撞进
Crash?


1249
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:58.740
撞进
Crash?


1250
00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:01.080
随便哪个咔嘣公爵都能着陆
Any Duke Caboom toy can land...


1251
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.160
但只有你可以用独一无二的方式撞车
but you are the only one that can crash the way you do.


1252
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.830
-是吗  -没错
- I am? - Yes!


1253
00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:09.250
忘了雷加  忘了那个广告
Forget Rejean. Forget your commercial.


1254
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:11.630
坦然接受现在的自己
Be the Duke you are right now...


1255
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.220
跳跃撞车的公爵
the one who jumps and crashes!


1256
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:21.970
坦然接受现在的自己
Be who I am right now.


1257
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:25.270
谁是最好运的法裔加拿大佬
Who's the Canuck with all the luck?


1258
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:26.480
咔嘣
Caboom?


1259
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.730
谁是大白北最伟大的人
Who's the greatest of the Great White North?


1260
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:29.480
咔嘣
Caboom!


1261
00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.150
谁是加拿大史上最伟大的冒险家
Who's the most spectacular daredevil Canada has ever seen?


1262
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:34.740
咔嘣公爵
Duke Caboom!


1263
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:36.200
你能做到这个跳跃吗
Can you do the jump?


1264
00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.450
我能做到  加拿大
Yes, I Canada!


1265
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.620
我们找到进去的办法了
We've got our ride.


1266
00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:46.460
咦嗬
Yee-haw!


1267
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:47.540
宝贝
Yo, Bo!


1268
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.540
笑笑  你们做到了
Gigs! You made it!


1269
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:51.170
干得好
Good work!


1270
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.630
你们是怎么拿到的
How'd you get it?


1271
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.840
我们怎样才能拿到那把钥匙
How do we get that key?


1272
00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.140
-很艰难  -非常困难
- It was hard. - Very difficult.


1273
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.720
-我们差点就逃不出来了  -没错
- Barely made it out alive. - Yeah.


1274
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.890
所以  不用谢
So, you're welcome.


1275
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.310
好了  我们开始吧
Okay. Let's do this.


1276
00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.400
我来帮你把这个包起来
Let me wrap that up for you.


1277
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.230
可不想在回家的路上搞坏了
Don't want anything to happen to it on the way home.


1278
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:14.570
很好  有人买东西  会给我们争取点时间
Good. That sale buys us some time.


1279
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:17.820
等一下
Wait for it.


1280
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.450
好了  我们走
All right, let's go!


1281
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.210
<b>电影票</b>

1282
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:52.060
<b>咔嘣公爵</b>

1283
01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.450
那个  你在这里待了多久
So, how long were you in here?


1284
01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:06.330
不知道  几年吧
I don't know. Couple years.


1285
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:09.370
我不想一直待在架子上  等着生活发生变化
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf waiting for my life to happen.


1286
01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:11.250
所以我离开了
So, I left.


1287
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.000
你远比我更会应对丢失的玩具的生活
You've handled this lost toy life better than I could.


1288
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.500
警长
Sheriff.


1289
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:18.420
你这是妄自菲薄
You're selling yourself short.


1290
01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.840
我觉得你这个丢失的玩具做得很好了
I think you'd make a great lost toy.


1291
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.930
<b>月球原子爆米花</b>

1292
01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:25.060
你真的觉得
You really don't think


1293
01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.390
你不会再找一个孩子了吗
you'll ever be in a kid's room again, huh?


1294
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.140
没错
Nope.


1295
01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.680
而现在嘉年华要离开这里了
And now with the carnival traveling through,


1296
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.020
这是我们的机会  搭便车
it's our chance to hop a ride...


1297
01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.400
-离开这个镇子  -你要走
- and leave town. - You're leaving?


1298
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.150
当然了
Sure am.


1299
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.610
你有没有想过出去见见世面
You ever think about getting out there, seeing the world?


1300
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:37.860
没有孩子在身边
Without a kid?


1301
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.570
没有  我这个老玩具没法接受新理念
No. You can't teach this old toy new tricks.


1302
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:43.280
别这么肯定
You'd be surprised.


1303
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:47.990
你是怎么到这家店里来的呢
So, how'd you end up in this store in the first place?


1304
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.500
我在展示窗看到了你的台灯
Well, I saw your lamp in the window...


1305
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.170
我想也许你在里面
and I thought maybe you were inside...


1306
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:56.130
所以我...
and so I, uh...


1307
01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:05.550
看看这个
Will you look at that?


1308
01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.640
这是这家店我唯一喜欢的部分
This is the only part of the store I ever liked.


1309
01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.110
这次跳跃对你和公爵来说可不简单
That's gonna be quite a jump for you and Duke.


1310
01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:23.740
我
For me?


1311
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.950
我没告诉你吗  你要跟他一起去
Didn't I tell you? You're going with him.


1312
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:30.950
是吗
I am?


1313
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:32.660
我们开始咔嘣吧
Let's caboom.


1314
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.540
没事的  公爵是最厉害的
It'll be fine, Duke's the best.


1315
01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.500
是啊  撞车最厉害
Yeah, at crashing.


1316
01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.710
就是现在
And now!


1317
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:44.760
上
Go!


1318
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:55.270
雷加
Rejean.


1319
01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.110
那是广告  那不是真的
It's a commercial. It's not real!


1320
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.900
我做不到  对不起  雷加
I can't do this! I'm sorry, Rejean!


1321
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.570
不  不  不
No, no, no!


1322
01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.700
近来可好  小猫咪
What's new, pussycat?


1323
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:25.260
-叉叉  -姑娘们
- Forky? - Girls?


1324
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.050
叉叉  你在哪
Forky, where are you?


1325
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:29.720
<b>嘉比嘉比
我们做朋友吧</b>


1326
01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:28.760
你是绝对找不到我的
You're never gonna find me.


1327
01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.640
叉叉
Forky?


1328
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:33.220
胡迪  你是怎么找到我的
Woody! How'd you find me?


1329
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:35.230
-宝贝  我找到他了  -你好
- Bo, I found him! - Hi.


1330
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:37.940
等等  叉叉就是把叉子
Wait, it's an actual fork?


1331
01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.690
宝贝  宝贝  宝贝
Bo! Bo! Bo!


1332
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:41.150
巴斯  那些假人不见了
Buzz! The dummies are gone!


1333
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:43.740
什么  他们去哪了
What? Where'd they go?


1334
01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.280
好了  我们可以走了
Okay, we can go now!


1335
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.870
-不行  我得找到我的姑娘们  -你好  胡迪
- No. I need to find my girls. - Hello, Woody.


1336
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.070
你好  宝贝
Hi, Bo.


1337
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.370
-我的羊呢  -对啊
- Where are my sheep - Yeah!


1338
01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:53.040
看  胡迪找到我了
Look! Woody found me!


1339
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.370
抓那只兔子  我这么可爱  我还不能死
Take the bunny! I'm too cute to die!


1340
01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.460
不  不
No, no!


1341
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:00.500
胡迪
Woody!


1342
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.710
我只是想聊聊
I just wanna talk.


1343
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.880
是跟我的声匣聊吧
Yeah, with my voice box!


1344
01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:05.800
拉
Pull!


1345
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.260
你是我最爱的警官
You're my favorite deputy.


1346
01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.640
有人给水池下毒了
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.


1347
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.390
我想加入你们的队伍
I'd like to join your posse.


1348
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.350
举起手来
Reach for the sky!


1349
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.530
姑娘们
Girls!


1350
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:31.370
松嘴
Drop it.


1351
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.200
不要  叉叉
No! No! Forky!


1352
01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.870
-我们得走了  -等等
- We've got to go! - Wait!


1353
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.080
叉叉
Forky!


1354
01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.340
胡迪
Woody!


1355
01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.100
邦妮的背包
Bonnie's backpack?


1356
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:07.280
笑笑
Giggle!


1357
01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.820
别让胡迪离开
Don't let Woody leave!


1358
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:15.030
抓上
Grab on!


1359
01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.290
公爵  带我们离开这里
Duke, get us out of here!


1360
01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.040
好
Oui!


1361
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.920
这边  小猫咪
Here, kitty, kitty!


1362
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.880
等等  我们还没带上叉叉
Wait! We don't have Forky!


1363
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.420
胡迪
Woody!


1364
01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.340
叉叉
Forky!


1365
01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:53.910
大家都没事吧
Is everyone okay?


1366
01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.580
-没事了  -没事了
- It's okay. - It's okay.


1367
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.040
小兔  小兔
Bunny? Bunny!


1368
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:07.710
小兔  不要啊
Bunny! No, no, no, no.


1369
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:11.550
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.


1370
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.510
-小兔  -没事了
- Bunny! - It's gonna be okay.


1371
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:14.390
叉叉还在里面
Forky's still in there.


1372
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.840
如果我们抓紧
If we hurry,


1373
01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:16.260
就可以在他们把他关起来前救他
we can get him before they lock him up.


1374
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.640
你想让我们再回去
You want us to go back in there?


1375
01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.930
我们九死一生才逃出来
We barely got out alive.


1376
01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:20.060
胡迪  我们最好等等
Woody, it's better if we wait.


1377
01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.310
不行  没有时间了  我们很轻易就能回去
No, no, no. There's no time. We can easily get back inside.


1378
01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:22.940
但是我看见了邦妮的...
But I saw Bonnie's...


1379
01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.310
我数了一下  总共只有四个假人
By my count, there were only four dummies.


1380
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:24.650
但是背包...
But the backpack...


1381
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:26.480
他们寡不敌众  所以我们有优势
We outnumber them. So we have the advantage.


1382
01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.440
胡迪  看看我们
Woody, look at us!


1383
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:33.780
没人赞成你  事情结束了  好吗
Nobody is with you. It's over, okay?


1384
01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.450
不  不行  我们在浪费时间  我们能做到的
No. No, no, no. We are wasting time. We can do this.


1385
01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:38.370
-拜托  拉绳布偶  -这不值得
- Come on, Pull-string. - It's not worth it.


1386
01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:39.700
没错  听听她说的
Yeah, yes, listen to her!


1387
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.410
-没有人想这么做  -我想
- Nobody wants this! - I do!


1388
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:42.750
-为什么  -因为
- Why? - Because!


1389
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.500
-为什么  -就是因为
- Why? - Just because!


1390
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.080
到底为什么
Why?


1391
01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.590
因为这是我唯一能做的了
Because it's all I have left to do!


1392
01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.590
除此之外我一无所有
I don't have anything else.


1393
01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.050
所以我们对你来说什么都不是吗
So, the rest of us don't count?


1394
01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.720
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.


1395
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.140
邦妮需要叉叉
Bonnie needs Forky.


1396
01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.520
不  是你需要邦妮
No. You need Bonnie!


1397
01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:03.100
睁大眼睛看看  胡迪
Open your eyes, Woody.


1398
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.100
这世上有那么多孩子
There's plenty of kids out there.


1399
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:08.940
你为什么非要抓住这个不放
It can't be just about the one you're still clinging to.


1400
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.150
这叫忠诚
It's called loyalty.


1401
01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.950
丢失的玩具是不能理解的
Something a lost toy wouldn't understand.


1402
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.450
丢失的玩具不是我
I'm not the one who's lost.


1403
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.210
我们离开这里吧
Let's get out of here.


1404
01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.710
我们得赶紧回到明天早上就要出发的嘉年华
We've got a carnival that leaves in the morning.


1405
01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:29.790
走吧
Come on.


1406
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.130
我们会找到自己的孩子的
We'll find our own kid.


1407
01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:34.170
你真是疯了
You're crazy.


1408
01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.550
宝贝
Bo!


1409
01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:41.720
再见胡迪  祝你回到邦妮身边
Bye, Woody. Good luck with Bonnie.


1410
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.310
胡迪  能做的你都做了
Woody, you did all you could.


1411
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.150
该回家了
Time to go home.


1412
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.690
不
No.


1413
01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.820
-胡迪  -我不会把玩具丢下的  巴斯
- Woody. - I don't leave toys behind, Buzz.


1414
01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:57.820
是的  但是胡迪  事实上...
Yeah, but, Woody, you're actually leaving...


1415
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.030
现在不会  以后也不会
Not now. Not ever.


1416
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.660
然后他把我丢下了
And he left me behind.


1417
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:06.290
现在怎么办  内心的声音
What now, inner voice?


1418
01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.210
任务已完成  返回基地
Mission accomplished. Return to base.


1419
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:10.630
回房车  那胡迪怎么办
Go back to the RV? What about Woody?


1420
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:12.460
我们要回家了  太空游侠
We're going home, space ranger.


1421
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.590
退后  这个星球...
Fall back, this planet...


1422
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:14.710
撤退  有太多...
Retreat! There's too...


1423
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:17.090
快走  该起飞了  离开  后退  跑
Go! Time to fly! Exit the... Back... Run...


1424
01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:18.840
出去  返回星际总部
Get out! Returning to Star Command.


1425
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.220
好  好
Okay. Okay.


1426
01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.850
非常感谢  内心的声音
Thanks a lot, inner voice.


1427
01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:29.560
哈莫妮  亲爱的  帮外婆关门打烊吧
Harmony, honey, help Grandma close up for the night.


1428
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.690
好  然后我们能去嘉年华吗
Okay. Then can we go to the carnival?


1429
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:33.480
可以
Sure.


1430
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:40.530
你好  胡迪
Hello, Woody.


1431
01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.330
我就知道你会回来
I knew you'd be back.


1432
01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:45.870
你不了解我
You don't know me.


1433
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:47.250
我确实了解
But I do.


1434
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:51.380
你被留在壁橱里  感觉自己毫无用处
You were left in the closet, feeling useless...


1435
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.540
怀疑自己还会不会被孩子玩
wondering if you'll ever get played with.


1436
01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:55.590
没有叉叉我是不会走的
I'm not leaving without Forky.


1437
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:58.050
我们能就在一件事上达成共识吗
Can we agree on just one thing?


1438
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:59.170
什么
What?


1439
01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.300
陪伴一个孩子
That being there for a child


1440
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.390
是玩具能做的最高尚的事
is the most noble thing a toy can do.


1441
01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.180
好的
Okay.


1442
01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:12.940
我一拆封就有缺陷
I was defective right out of the box.


1443
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.860
我只能想象你这样是什么感觉
I can only imagine what it must have been like for you.


1444
01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.360
你陪伴安迪那么长时间
All that time you spent with Andy...


1445
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.030
第一次和他一起骑自行车
riding a bike with him for the first time...


1446
01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.080
他膝盖擦伤时安慰他
comforting him when he skinned his knee...


1447
01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.460
骄傲地看他长大
proudly watching him grow up.


1448
01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:35.290
然后你又和邦妮有了第二次机会
And then you got a second chance with Bonnie...


1449
01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:38.590
当她在学校害怕时给她安慰
giving her comfort when she's scared at school...


1450
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:41.430
在她最需要的时候帮助她
helping her when she needs it most.


1451
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:45.350
他们的悲喜你一直陪伴
You've been there through all their ups and downs.


1452
01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.560
拜托
Please.


1453
01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:50.690
跟我说实话
Be honest with me.


1454
01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.150
真的像听起来那么棒吗
Was it as wonderful as it sounds?


1455
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:00.150
是的
It was.


1456
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:07.870
我想要的只是其中一个片段
All I want is a chance for just one of those moments.

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.590
请你离开
Now, please go away.


1595
01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:41.060
你听到了吗
You hear that?


1596
01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.570
有个朋友曾告诉我
A friend once told me...


1597
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:52.030
"这世上有那么多孩子"
"There are plenty of kids out there."


1598
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:56.080
其中一个叫邦妮
And one of them is named Bonnie.


1599
01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:00.600
她现在正在等你
She's waiting for you, right now.


1600
01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.740
只是她还不知道
She just doesn't know it yet.


1601
01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.820
万一你错了呢
What if you're wrong?


1602
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.240
如果你下半生都待在架子上
Well, if you sit on a shelf the rest of your life...


1603
01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.370
你永远也不会知道  不是吗
you'll never find out, will you?


1604
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:18.900
他说得对
He's right.


1605
01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.910
最厉害的玩具教给我的
I learned that from the best.


1606
01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.260
走吧  嘉比

1607

我们带你去找邦妮
Let's get you to Bonnie.


1608
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:37.780
旋转木马
The carousel?


1609
01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.610
没错  就是那个有灯有马的旋转圆盘
Yeah, it's the spinny ride with lights and horses.


1610
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:42.480
胡迪说在那里等他
Woody said to meet him there.


1611
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.280
-你肯定是在开玩笑  -我们怎么做
- You got to be kidding! - How do we do that?


1612
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.190
我们可以...
We could...


1613
01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:46.760
我们不能把爸爸送去坐牢
We are not sending Dad to jail.


1614
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.010
你真没劲
You're no fun.


1615
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:51.090
八百米后左转
Left turn in 0.5 miles.


1616
01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:53.790
等一下  我有个主意
Wait a second. I have an idea.


1617
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:05.800
臭鼬
Skunk!


1618
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:20.320
人太多了  需要换一条路
Too many people. Gonna need an alternate route.


1619
01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.430
我们能及时赶到旋转木马吗
Will we make it to the carousel in time?


1620
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:28.150
我们能行  加拿大
Yes, we Canada!


1621
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.860
什么  怎么了
What? What is it?


1622

什么  右转
What? A right?


1624
01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.420
前方右转
Right turn ahead.


1625
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.200
GPS听起来是不是有点奇怪
Does the GPS sound funny to you?


1626
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.140
亲爱的  没事的  开车吧
Honey, it's fine. Just drive.


1627
01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.670
我觉得挺起来挺奇怪的
I thought it sounded funny.


1628
01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:51.930
接着右转
Another right!


1629
01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:54.450
-右转  -接着右转

Another right, really?


1631
01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:57.040

- We're headin' back. - There's the carousel!


1634
01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.900
你们觉得胡迪能及时赶到吗
Do you think Woody will get there in time?


1635
01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.960
不行  没门  决不  不干  拒绝
Nope. Forget it. Never. No. No way. Declined.


1636
01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.720
-没戏  反对  -公爵  公爵  你能行的
- No dice. Rejected. - Duke, Duke, you got this.


1637
01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.590
这是去旋转木马最快的方法
This is the fastest way to the carousel.


1638
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:12.940
上次你就跳成功了
You made the last jump.


1639
01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.190
但上次是一米二  这次是十二米
Yeah, but that was 4 feet. This is 40!

Exactly! Duke Caboom would never repeat a stunt.

- No. He'd never do that. - No, no, no.

他就是那个玩具  飞跃十二米
He's the toy that went on to crash 40 feet
