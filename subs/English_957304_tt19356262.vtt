1
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.810
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.330
You're free Wednesday.

3
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.750
Listen, it's not even a word.

4
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.090
Not really.

5
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.870
Okay, sure.

6
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.670
Free for dinner Wednesday?

7
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.610
There's a new place near me, Montana's.

8
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.750
It's very good.

9
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.070
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.


10
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.650
No, I have an engagement Wednesday.

11
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.950
Okay, huh.

12
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.050
Wednesday too.

13
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.970
People don't really call them engagements.

14
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.721
Do I tell you how to speak?

15
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.210
Yes.

16
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.550
The fact remains.

17
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.870
The engagement? That's right.

18
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.590
Huh?

19
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.150
Oh, oh my God!

20
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.760
Jesus, Mary Ann, don't call me nerd sex.

21
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.340
Yes, I am going tonight.

22
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.700
Very sex.

23
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.120
Hi, Sukey.

24
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400
Who?

25
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.120
Here? Yes, there.

26
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.160
Oh, no one's here babe.

27
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.300
I was just masturbating.

28
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800
Uh-huh.

29
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.080
Me-me time.

30
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.740
Let me turn the video down.

31
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.850
No.

32
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.390
What?

33
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.750
No.

34
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.350
No what, Carla?

35
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.930
You're not wearing that.

36
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.410
I just came from work.
I came from Toledo. I don't dress like it.


37
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.070
Is Jamie here?

38
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.630
Okay, like, keep the coat on,
take the shirt off underneath.


39
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.110
And pull out my breasts.

40
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.850
I'm not here to puddle my breasts.

41
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.230
Why else would you
leave? To socialize.


42
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.130
Oh, girls!

43
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.690
All I'm here lately is Y2K.

44
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.630
Y2K!

45
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.460
But Jamie does a
nine-shot competition of $19.


46
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:48.940
99 here at Sugar and Spice.

47
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.540
And Jamie is the last one
to put herself in for himself.


48
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.511
So, firstly... You.

49
00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:07.560
It's okay.

50
00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:10.921
Don't put that woman in front
of a crowd like a microphone.


51
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400
She likes to entertain.

52
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.600
She gets this reinforcement.

53
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.860
Do you know when she's fucking?

54
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.220
I don't know that she's seeing anyone.

55
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.580
She's seeing you, of course.

56
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.820
She's a free spirit. I admire her.

57
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.440
Freak.

58
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.270
It's not fair to see you.

59
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.690
I've had it with love.

60
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.870
I know bars and
troubadours are high on it,

61
00:08:02.895 --> 00:08:04.810
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the


62
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:06.650
modern 20 and soon-to-be

63
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.981
Just here, it's with a piece of blood.

64
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:10.776
Just right here is when he gets ya.

65
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.290
Mm-hmm.

66
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.711
I've got your plan, my friend.

67
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:16.026
Gilphum helped me move
my shit out of Sydney tomorrow.


68
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.626
I'm not getting a middle of that.
I have my own problems.


69
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.650
What problems? Internal.

70
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.026
Yes. I don't know
how else to put it.

71
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.730
Problems with what they feel internally.

72
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.251
How can you have internal problems?

73
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.690
You know, giraffe-hole broke dope.

74
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.190
I'm not certain, honey-darling, that you
have ever reached deep inside any orifice


75
00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:37.810
to scoop out your soul

76
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.610
and fling it shamelessly
in a fellow human being


77
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.330
and humiliate yourself

78
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.530
and grubble and weep and feel your ego

79
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:48.470
completely disintegrate,
otherwise known as the Gloria of...


80
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.090
Please tell me about the key.

81
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.510
Now, my plan is...

82
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.830
You come help me back, and then...

83
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.180
I can't even believe you tell.

84
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.410
What? I am too. 
That was my plan.

85
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.550
Where are you going?

86
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.850
Tallahassee, Florida.

87
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.110
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?


88
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.630
They had Ella's sleep, Sarah.

89
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.370
Can't shame them.

90
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.950
Tallahassee is very nice.

91
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.980
It's not glitzy and gross like Miami.

92
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.770
It has live oak and Spanish moss.

93
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.990
Me and Aunt Ella's go to the St.
Mark's Wildlife Preserve.


94
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.510
There's good birding.

95
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.290
Birding?

96
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.290
How have I missed out on this?

97
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.730
It's very pleasant.

98
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.691
So you just came up with
this wild hair in your ass to burr.


99
00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:27.970
I've been happy, and I'm
starting to snap at people at work,


100
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.530
and it's not fair to them.

101
00:09:30.355 --> 00:09:31.610
I'm only impatient with myself.

102
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.890
Well, we can fix that.

103
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.910
We'll have you run around in no time.

104
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.090
That's why we take this
trip together, honey-babe.


105
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.790
We get our shit together, together.

106
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.060
See, I was going to take
some time off, get a drive away,


107
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.290
just go pop up anywhere.

108
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.750
Now, you can come with me, and
we can go to Tallahassee and burr.


109
00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:57.774
<b>Subtitle made by Master_Blaster for https://subscene.com/</b>

110
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.090
Ooh!

111
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.510
Yeah!

112
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.490
What's a drive away?

113
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.970
Pretty well away, Riddle.

114
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.510
You'd live in the car to wherever someone
find that a drive away company wants it


115
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:26.271
if they got one going
near your destination.


116
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.610
I don't know what you'll like, NLS.

117
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:31.410
Are you kidding? A birder?

118
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.510
I don't wear my
great big old straw hat,

119
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.890
and she is going to L
-O
-V
-E. Love me.

120
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.366
You know how parents and social love me.

121
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.390
I think I got charisma.

122
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.110
Oh, Marianne, who's your lo-facious friend?

123
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.830
I just love that chatty little girl,
isn't she something? I'm not sure.


124
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.270
I find no problem here.

125
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.150
This is going to be F
-U
-N
-N fun, girl.

126
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.950
Just come help me move
my stuff out of the cookie store.


127
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.500
Don't worry, she's not
even going to be there.


128
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.230
Oh, God, Jesus! Oh, God!

129
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.010
Don't! What are you doing?

130
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.810
I don't want it anymore!

131
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.510
Who essentially would it be?

132
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.790
Suki, I'm just taking my own stuff.

133
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.350
That was a gift. 
I wanted you to have it.

134
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.510
I don't want it, and we're
not going to both use it.


135
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.850
Suki, it's your little dildo.

136
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.630
Oh, no, no, Noah.

137
00:11:20.235 --> 00:11:22.710
Take that one still. 
I never liked her.

138
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:24.630
She won't stop working!

139
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.140
How can I take the dog, Suki?
I don't have a home.


140
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.530
Remember? You kicked me out.

141
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.730
Take out and take the whole house out.

142
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.970
It's your door, Noah, Susanna.

143
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.690
Curly's Drive-Away, Pennsylvania's
most trusted name in car delivery.


144
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:41.370
Curly speaking.

145
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.350
Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.

146
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.130
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

147
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.356
Yeah, you have something
to write this down.


148
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.490
Yes, I'm writing it down.

149
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:50.490
Right.

150
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:51.290
Tallahassee.

151
00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:52.291
Sorry.

152
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:53.470
Right, got it.

153
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.230
Get in your bus.

154
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.280
We'll be there by
the end of day tomorrow.

155
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.990
By tomorrow? No later.

156
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.890
Uh-huh.

157
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:58.670
Okay.

158
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.070
Over and out.

159
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.430
Can you help us? 
We need a drive-away.

160
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.970
Two hundred and fifty
dollars deposit in the reference.


161
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.030
Revers.

162
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.266
It's what it'll look like
when he breaks his balls.


163
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.810
Don't show up when you're supposed to.

164
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.270
His balls.

165
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.670
Can the reference be a woman?

166
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.050
We don't know a woman.

167
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.190
Okay.

168
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:21.690
What do you want to know?

169
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:22.970
Tallahassee? Tallahassee.

170
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.470
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.


171
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.010
There's Spanish law saying live over here.

172
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.210
Don't call me Curly.

173
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.010
And your name, huh?

174
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.990
My name is Curly.
We just met. It's too familiar.


175
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.310
Have you ever been to Tallahassee?

176
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.690
No, I've got good sense.

177
00:12:42.315 --> 00:12:43.490
Your car is a Dodge Airy's.

178
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.110
Oh.

179
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.170
Okay.

180
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.730
Is that a good car? Not really.

181
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.850
You still know the trips?

182
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.010
There's also a place here in Wellington.

183
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.030
Fantastic, that part. 
The Butterchurn.

184
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.350
And this place, Levi's
Barbecue in Charleston.


185
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.126
Memphis-style barbecue. Really good.

186
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.230
Everyone goes to Tullyburg.

187
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.290
What do you mean?

188
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.910
It's a straight shot to Tallahassee.

189
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.330
Down and across.

190
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.226
Right. Here's the world's largest
Dixie Cup outside of Mission, Georgia.


191
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.230
Direct route. Down and across.

192
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.570
We don't need to see the
world's largest Dixie Cup.


193
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.970
We don't need to enjoy life.

194
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.210
But as long as we're here, the
world's largest Dixie Cup is not life.


195
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.510
It's a straight shot.

196
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:19.270
On the interstate.

197
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.110
Down and across.

198
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.270
Interstate is not life.

199
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.230
It is more than the
world's largest Dixie Cup.


200
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.466
You're the one that went into a bargain.

201
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:24.910
That's nature.

202
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.840
What's a die car? 
That's not nature?

203
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.606
You better Dixie Cup.
You can make an argument.


204
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.416
He said it was a rush job. We're
supposed to have the car there tomorrow.


205
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440
Tomorrow can be a day.

206
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.050
We can't even go to Lincoln.

207
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.370
But he needs a high heels.

208
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.950
Little doctor or a reverend.

209
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.850
Yeah, no, we don't have a
discount for Medi-God, no.


210
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.890
No, not for medical doctors either.

211
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.370
Make every mind which are you.

212
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.690
It doesn't matter. 
We have no discounts.

213
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.150
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.


214
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.290
Thank you for calling Curly's.

215
00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.870
Welcome to Curly's driveway.

216
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.571
Well... We're here.

217
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.030
Okay.

218
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.810
Who are you? The car.

219
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:08.811
The car.

220
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.090
The Dodge Aries.

221
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.490
The Dodge Aries.

222
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.010
What are you, a minor bird?

223
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.530
Curly, I understand that.

224
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.670
You are not the Dodge.

225
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.930
What do you mean?

226
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.410
We're not the Dodge.

227
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.630
What's the big deal?

228
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.930
The car isn't ours.

229
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.710
But it's ours.

230
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.130
And the car is ours.

231
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:38.830
Don't tell Hassey.

232
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.910
Once we get to Tallahassee, it stops
being art and starts being vandalism.


233
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.546
Okay, for sake, Mary, it'll come
off with a little soap and water.


234
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:44.970
It won't.

235
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:45.971
Well, what?

236
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.510
Come off with soap and water.

237
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.850
Well, how do you know? I tried.

238
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.890
Mary, it's art.

239
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.370
Stop saying it's art.

240
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.750
That doesn't end all discussion.

241
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.266
We're going to be driving
through some conservative towns.


242
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.650
The South?

243
00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:58.830
The Bible Belt?

244
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.970
Oh, don't I know it.

245
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.450
Honey, I grew up where the Bible Belt
means the ass crack of the Pecos River.


246
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.810
Fort Worth is nowhere near the Pecos River.

247
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.030
That's Pecos.

248
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.310
Honey, darling.

249
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.750
The car art is just a part
of a larger undertaking.


250
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.350
My project.

251
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.710
What's your project?

252
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.450
Loosening you up so we
can get you late, sure, sweetie.


253
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.830
How long's it been? Wait.

254
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.750
Once?

255
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.630
Oh, my God, Mary, and
don't tell me it's been years.


256
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.770
How many years?

257
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.510
Who was it?

258
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.030
You've had sex since what's
your name, haven't you? Donna.


259
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.450
Yeah, Donna.

260
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.510
Oh, my God.

261
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.890
Oh, my God, Donna?

262
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.070
She wouldn't have forgotten Gornium.

263
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.550
Neither.

264
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.170
That's right.

265
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.830
She just looks like Gornium.

266
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.430
Wait a minute.

267
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.210
You said people of
yours would come in for it.


268
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.690
Yes, I did.

269
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.250
You call with the drop-off in Tallahassee.

270
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.130
And then these broads come in and
say they're ready to go to Tallahassee.


271
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.650
You gave them the car.

272
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.720
You don't know who they were?

273
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.470
I told you their names.

274
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.070
Their names, yes.

275
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.590
The places have come.

276
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.390
They drive the car instead of you.

277
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:22.430
Is that bad?

278
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.370
Bad, if they find the goods.

279
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.446
What's the pigsty? Why don't
you get a girl away? I like clutter.


280
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.410
They didn't have a cellular film.

281
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.610
The girl doesn't work for me.

282
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.270
He asked you a question, dick-enk.

283
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.030
Dick-enk? Flint.

284
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.550
I'm a dick-enk.

285
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.090
Don't antagonize.

286
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.816
We're talking to a book that would cement.

287
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.126
You wouldn't know what
cemented would beat you in the ass.


288
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.150
And you would?

289
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.750
So, there's no way to get in
contact with them? Not per se.


290
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.970
Per se?

291
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:49.910
They left a local number.

292
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.550
Everybody's got to leave a local number.

293
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.090
Someone who's bald is afraid.

294
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.990
Now you've got to do it.

295
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.070
Ah!

296
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.710
Suzanne Shachel now, 2431, with Garnet.

297
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.670
You better hope your
friends deliver that car.


298
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.680
This is great.

299
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.820
This is so slutty.

300
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.180
I don't love this.

301
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.461
Don't they have postcards?

302
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.760
Jamie?

303
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.780
Alright, let's put on our war
paint and the butter turn away.


304
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.280
Jamie, I think I prefer to-

305
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.740
Nope, don't even come with me.

306
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.520
I'll show you how this is done.

307
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:45.990
Hiya.

308
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.670
Do you know where the butter turn is?

309
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.310
That car?

310
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.930
Or do you have like a timeout Wellington?

311
00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.790
I mean, is there one
with gay lesbian lesbians?


312
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.090
You wouldn't have one.

313
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.790
But do you know if there's a newsstand

314
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.490
or a lesbian bookstore?

315
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.250
You know, it's at the
corner or something like that.


316
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.480
Hello? Confidence.

317
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.290
You've got so big of a
comfortable and physical.


318
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.170
It's kind of like meeting
somebody at a now convention


319
00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:23.246
when you're talking about
just making a little picture of me.


320
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.430
Jamie?

321
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.990
I have done this before.

322
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.070
It's just like this.

323
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.590
One message.

324
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.950
You stay in a female body.

325
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.810
Your body.

326
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.110
You're like this.

327
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.290
Not like this.

328
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.110
Let's just make a little picture of me.

329
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.570
I have done this before.

330
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:41.670
I am not a school lawyer.

331
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:43.470
You fuck people that work for Ralph Nade.

332
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.290
Not only.

333
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.510
Only in the last four years.

334
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.570
Three years.

335
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:58.590
What do you feel in
your body? Very much so.


336
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.190
I got you.

337
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.870
Good weeks, good day.

338
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.520
Like you'll do?

339
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.760
Please, please, come hold me, baby.

340
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.720
You seem totally okay.

341
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.960
Are there any other
mediocre ones like you at all?


342
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.480
I didn't say they all
tweedy or curse about fine.


343
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.460
Yeah, but not in
the sense of super fine.

344
00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:26.120
In the sense of fine.

345
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.960
Why are you jousting with me?

346
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.120
I'm not jousting.

347
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.580
I'm asking which of these women
you are not throwing against the wall.


348
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.340
You fuck black ladies, don't worry.

349
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.260
Look, gentlemen.

350
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.416
I'm not a throw-up against the wall and
fuck the daylights out of a kind of person.


351
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.796
Stop trying to make me something I'm not.

352
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.660
I'm just trying to eat
you late, you're sweet.


353
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.820
They sense it.

354
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.760
Whether you want to fuck
them or he's either a spy or not.


355
00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.340
It has to be me.

356
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.860
It has to be done with authenticity.

357
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.120
You mean with a board?

358
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.260
I mean with authenticity.

359
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.880
Authenticity is somebody
that works for her out there.


360
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.516
You don't know what her life was like.

361
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.040
You know nothing about its worth.

362
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.740
Then why didn't the two of you move to Santa
Fe and synchronize her Mitchell cycles?


363
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:03.780
That didn't happen.

364
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:04.860
That's why you're here.

365
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.100
In the back bar, looking
for a cheap, sleazy sex.


366
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.300
No, I'm not.

367
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.180
This is not me.

368
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.500
You're right, I can't do this.

369
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.180
No, Mary.

370
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.520
I'm sorry, honey girl.

371
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.680
I'm saying you can do this.

372
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.380
You can do this.

373
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.380
You can beat you.

374
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.500
I promise, honey girl.

375
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.460
You're best still.

376
00:20:21.461 --> 00:20:24.660
Jamie, I know you're well intentioned,
but this really isn't right for me.


377
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.000
You should stay and
enjoy your night on the town.


378
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.970
Hello.

379
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.510
Good evening.

380
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.990
I'm Amber.

381
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:01.790
Marion.

382
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.930
What'd you read in?

383
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.170
Europeans by Henry James.

384
00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.970
Wow, thick one.

385
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.750
Hello, Marion.

386
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.410
Hello.

387
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.310
So, is this gonna be
a threesome? Nope.


388
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:23.770
No, no.

389
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.330
Oh, okay, rats.

390
00:21:51.280 --> 00:22:01.280
Wow.

391
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:07.870
Bouncy.

392
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.210
How's your book?

393
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:19.550
It's about two free spirits who visit
a repressed family in New England.


394
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:20.290
Ah, hello.

395
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.410
They are all repressed in New England.

396
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.490
That is why we
are going the other way.

397
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.990
Although there was this one chick
I screamed once on her page here.


398
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.350
She got her tongue so far in me, I
swore it was gonna wriggle out my asshole.


399
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:33.790
No, I'm not kidding.

400
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.530
They say that there's advanced
yoga people in India supposedly.


401
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:37.730
You can do that.

402
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.070
Black dots and cunnilingus.

403
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.270
They can even cunniling themselves.

404
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.090
They got pictures of
it in like medical texts.


405
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.650
They got an ass librarian
that'll keep me in stacks.


406
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.870
Who wrote your
book? Henry James.


407
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.150
Henry James.

408
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.110
American writer.

409
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.890
His family, his brother, kid.

410
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.310
Great.

411
00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.890
No, kid.

412
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.110
Hello, who Henry James is.

413
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.850
White and uptight.

414
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.870
I had his read Portrait
of a Lady in School.


415
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.450
Boy, that was a great read.

416
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.870
Somebody dragging the
day-old spaghetti across my tits.


417
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.330
Very absolutely.

418
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.130
His prose is a different thing.

419
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.110
Yeah, put me on the whole book thing.

420
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.250
Henry James is in fact
the reason that I don't read.


421
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.770
Uh-huh.

422
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.510
Several times.

423
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.690
Uh-huh, yeah, I don't think you should
have brought one back to the room.


424
00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:31.330
I mean, this one's coming.

425
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.610
How do you think I felt?

426
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.850
You told me to have
a night on the table.

427
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:35.790
Yeah, people say things.

428
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.150
It's not always what they feel.

429
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.230
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.

430
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.010
We don't read minds.

431
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.646
We all wear it on a handshake basis.

432
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.090
What does that mean?

433
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.230
Hiya, how you doing?

434
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.590
How much for that Cali court?

435
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.190
How'd you like to have
one of your sex? Okay.


436
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.070
Where are you
from, girl? Not Texas.


437
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.810
Oh, no way.

438
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.350
Why'd you ask? I don't know.

439
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:54.210
Sorry.

440
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.320
No.

441
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.400
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.500
Why are you sorry? You're good.

443
00:25:11.501 --> 00:25:12.700
I'm a little.

444
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.120
..

445
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:15.460
I'm a big baby sometimes.

446
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640
Uncle G knows!

447
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.640
You are not going to believe this.

448
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.520
It's your parent.

449
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.020
You and G soccer team.

450
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:26.900
Uh-huh.

451
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.280
I was in line
next to Doreen, the captain.

452
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.200
Uh-huh.

453
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.729
They're very committed to lesbians,
and they're on their way to marry Dr.


454
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:35.040
Woodrow, which is
practically along our way.


455
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:35.900
Not exactly.

456
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.840
We were supposed to leave the car today.

457
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.556
Should we look at the
map and see how long?

458
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:39.900
Look at the map.

459
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.260
After today's game, these girls
are going to have a basement army.


460
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.980
And excuse me about it.

461
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.060
Sure you are.

462
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.440
Nuh-uh.

463
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.400
Us.

464
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.640
You see, the shit happens
when you and Uncle G knows.


465
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.360
Go!

466
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.500
Go!

467
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.030
That's all right.

468
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.290
We've got a plan B.

469
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:48.830
Yes, sir.

470
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.020
Yes, sir.

471
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.120
I understand that, sir.

472
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.740
You've got my word on it.

473
00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.700
You're just...

474
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.560
Rotate, right?

475
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.010
Can't we, um, see?

476
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.370
Actually, we're just friends.

477
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.620
Cool, Mary.

478
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.070
It's no big deal.

479
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.800
Suzanne Schinkelman?

480
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.140
Suzanne Schinkelman.

481
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.860
Who the fuck are you?

482
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.560
I was wondering why they curse like that.

483
00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.060
You know Jamie Dobbs?

484
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.340
You know Jamie Dobbs?

485
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.380
No, it was about that.

486
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.580
And Mary Bellamy?

487
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.400
You shouldn't do that.

488
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.440
He can't fight back.

489
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.260
He can't hit a girl.

490
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560
He's old school.

491
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.420
You just want to locate your friends.

492
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.020
They inadvertently took
something that belongs to us.


493
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.580
We don't want to hurt anyone.

494
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.000
They're not like friends
for as much as you would.


495
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.500
Okay.

496
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.920
It would be helpful
if you had a picture.

497
00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.300
Picture? Picture, yeah.

498
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.920
Got a picture of one of them.

499
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.150
You find them? 
Give it to her.

500
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.890
Okay.

501
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.310
We'll do.

502
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.031
Oh.

503
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:23.170
If you bring someone back, just...

504
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.570
I'll take my book to you, please.

505
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.230
There's still a couple of chapters left.

506
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.630
Mary!

507
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.630
We don't yet know exactly where they are,
they've got a picture of one of the girls.


508
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.190
We're all set.

509
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.990
And we will find them in the package.

510
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.830
Under control.

511
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.890
I understand that you're an happy sir.

512
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.270
I've got my two best men on.

513
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.750
Alright.

514
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.590
Get some coffee.

515
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.510
You two are going
to be driving all night.

516
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:05.511
Fuck.

517
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.170
Where are you
headed, miss? Home.


518
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.830
And where's that?

519
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.380
It's a motel, I don't know.

520
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.310
You don't know?

521
00:32:04.235 --> 00:32:05.630
I can't remember the name.

522
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.570
A motel, on the highway.

523
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:09.470
And where are you
coming from? A house.


524
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.110
Whose house?

525
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.730
I don't know, it was a slumber party.

526
00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.590
A little old for slumber parties,
aren't you miss? Look, mister.


527
00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.160
You know what?

528
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.160
I'm going to drop you off at home.

529
00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.580
Boo!

530
00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.020
Yeah!

531
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:54.410
Yeah!

532
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.980
Boo!

533
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.720
Where the fuck?

534
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:16.990
Boo!

535
00:36:16.991 --> 00:36:17.950
Boo! Boo! Hands up.

536
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.130
Want to get plaster?

537
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:29.590
I'll drive when it's my turn.

538
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.430
At the end of three hours, I have
no sympathy for you, my friend.


539
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.400
You could have just asked
her and you'd be fine right now.


540
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.090
I just asked, she answered.

541
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.298
But you cannot relate
to the public, which in a


542
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.210
service profession is a
big fucking hand again.


543
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.670
And that sound is
beginning to get irritating.


544
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.550
Well your lectures are getting irritating.

545
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:47.950
I don't lecture, my friend.

546
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.690
That's my point.

547
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.990
I take people in.

548
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.650
I react.

549
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.370
I read people to get what I want.

550
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:57.350
You, though, you think life is this orderly
series of people to beat the shit out of.


551
00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.490
Well, real life is not like that.

552
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.970
You only see it that way because
you're not nourished by human contact.


553
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.330
The human being give
and take, and so forth.


554
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.790
Uh-uh.

555
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.590
You want me to take it.

556
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:08.846
That's what you're comfortable with.

557
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:09.870
You hate man shit.

558
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.310
You don't engage the whole person.

559
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:16.130
You did a great job helping
me engage that very agile party.


560
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.730
Didn't have to.

561
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.683
No need whatsoever for the
physical approach, which you


562
00:37:20.695 --> 00:37:23.510
couldn't see because you
don't savor the stuff of life.


563
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:25.510
I'm not a sissy, boy. 
That's what you mean.

564
00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.990
Kiss my ass. I...

565
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:29.870
Hello?

566
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.220
Okay, we're on track.

567
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:36.630
Marion Polavi was picked
up for a personal appointment.


568
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.010
On it.

569
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.230
Thank you.

570
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.510
For what?

571
00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.110
Just picking me up.

572
00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.030
Am I not gonna pick
you up? Or not to.


573
00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.330
Ma'am, your friend here is in the
new scout here to come get her.


574
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.426
I'm gonna get you all day every day.

575
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.870
I will not let a friend of mine rot in
prison longer than is absolutely necessary.


576
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:13.990
And so I say thank you.

577
00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.300
Of course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison.


578
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.380
I've been careful not to
ask, but damn, Marion.


579
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.560
Lending yourself in prison
is a very hopeful sign for you.


580
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.120
I think it was jail, not prison.

581
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

582
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.340
You ain't told me how
you come to be in jail.


583
00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.180
It wasn't hell raising.
Sorry to disappoint.


584
00:38:40.575 --> 00:38:42.260
A police man didn't like my tone.

585
00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080
Oh?

586
00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.140
You cop some attitude.

587
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.580
I don't have attitude.

588
00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:54.685
Marion, if I may, there are
certain things in life which


589
00:38:54.697 --> 00:38:58.720
you've got to sense and
understand in order to live life.


590
00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.040
And one of the things that
you've got to understand is...


591
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:05.404
Well, all these funny
little creatures that you


592
00:39:05.416 --> 00:39:07.640
probably noticed walking
around on two legs,


593
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.240
what you call them human beings,

594
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.611
you've got to understand
what makes them tick.


595
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.660
And your whole social situation,
you've got to understand what that is.


596
00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:16.280
Uh-huh.

597
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.540
You know what that means?

598
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:18.760
Social situation.

599
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.660
I know what social situation means.

600
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.960
Okay, good.

601
00:39:22.095 --> 00:39:26.120
So, the whole thing with a cop is, and you
should remember this with each reference,


602
00:39:26.121 --> 00:39:28.760
when you're in a social
situation with a cop,


603
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.980
there ain't no social situation.

604
00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.071
There's a keep your
fucking mouth shut situation.


605
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.360
There's a yes sir
situation is what there is.


606
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.655
Believe me, I've been
dating a cop for two years


607
00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:41.880
now, and I ain't coming
through my bowl all year.


608
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.760
Thank you, I understand.

609
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.901
But if authority is being abused,
there's an obligation to... Holy shit.


610
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.040
Florida.

611
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:52.041
Florida.

612
00:39:55.730 --> 00:40:02.430
Lesbian, don't let the
sun go down on you here.


613
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.550
You okay? Spare tired.

614
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.990
What?

615
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.110
Something burning?

616
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.570
Jamie, it's cold.

617
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.950
Don't touch it.

618
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:14.690
I saw this movie once where they come
across this box, the people in the movie,


619
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:19.550
and they opened the box,
and it was like really, really bad.


620
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:55.070
Your traffic accident, fast
stop, his face hit the wheel.


621
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.041
Looking at a pretty
girl, weren't you Flint?


622
00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:01.771
No more looking at pretty
girls for you, right? That's right.


623
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.770
So, are they like wanted
or something? Oh no, no.


624
00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.650
No, they're not
in trouble at all.


625
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:13.610
Just drove off with something we
need, didn't even know they had it.


626
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.510
So, what were you all
doing here last night?


627
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.610
Just making out.

628
00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.610
Oh yeah? With who?

629
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.690
No kiss and tell, huh?

630
00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:34.130
Anyway, we need to find those
girls to get our sample case back.


631
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.230
And when we heard Doreen
here, paid Marion's fine.


632
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.476
We thought, well, you girls
might know where they're headed.


633
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.421
How do you know about
it's being Doreen's check?


634
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.610
We have contacts on law enforcement.

635
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.200
No, no. We should just call the cops.

636
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.460
We will, Jamie.
First, we should see what's in here.


637
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.480
Why? I don't want to look. Why
do I have to look? Jamie, listen.


638
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.960
Whoever sliced that head
off knows who we are.


639
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.940
This might tell us who they are,
so we won't be at a disadvantage.


640
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.900
The police can buy now,
and the police can protect us.


641
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.480
Protect us? They're not the Secret
Service, and we're not Chelsea Clinton.


642
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.900
What do we lose by looking?

643
00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.821
Look, I just want
to know what's going on.

644
00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.620
This might tell us.

645
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.060
I bet it's locked.

646
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:49.890
We ought to call the cops.

647
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.850
Why? That was awful.

648
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.930
You just said not to call the cops.

649
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.150
In ignorance.

650
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.830
No. What is it was true?

651
00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.086
The cops could think you're involved.

652
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.270
You just banned that in jail.

653
00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:01.370
From bankruptcy.

654
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.510
We wouldn't have anything to do with that.

655
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:06.390
Okay, honey, cool your jets.
Here's what we do.


656
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.230
First, we get to tell a hasty.

657
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.941
How about next time you
let me do all the talking? Sure.


658
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.326
Yes, that's what you're good at.

659
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.066
Well, it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.


660
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.630
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

661
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.446
Uh-huh. You think you would have
gotten the address where they're headed?


662
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:23.930
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

663
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.670
We've got some hard driving to do.

664
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:28.250
Bye!

665
00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.111
Welcome to Okan education order.

666
00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:36.110
Yeah, hi.
We have a room for two right away.


667
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.370
Uh, we do have one available, yes.

668
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.610
How many nights?

669
00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.690
Well, tonight and
then we'll play it by ear.


670
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:42.930
Take the rainbow
car? Um, sure we do.


671
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.010
Yes, actually, that's
just a Visa specialty card.


672
00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.876
Yeah, but they give a
percentage of each purchase


673
00:44:48.888 --> 00:44:50.606
to gay, lesbian, black,
transgender, and charity.


674
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:51.630
You do that right.

675
00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.490
Well, the issue would
be the one to take that.


676
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:55.931
Do you have a super-reinforced
safe with sensitive materials?


677
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.950
We do have in-room safes for
any valuables that you may have.


678
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.610
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right? Uh, yes.


679
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.450
Well, sure. We're friendly
to anyone who wants to stay.


680
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:06.470
You have ice.

681
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.600
This is it.

682
00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.720
It's at farm road 80.

683
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.100
What's the matter?

684
00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.740
Afraid of this stuff alive?

685
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.900
It's at farm road 80.

686
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.260
Is this, um, slappies?

687
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.960
Guys, you out?

688
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.440
Have you seen two, um,
non-local women come in here?


689
00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.480
That's one of them.

690
00:45:59.481 --> 00:46:04.400
I don't see any lessons you'll
kill from a company here about it.


691
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.520
One girl come in here.

692
00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.100
She'll be the main high upmost.

693
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.220
I'm ready to let you come
in here and tell her Visa.


694
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.980
Now, that's two.

695
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.600
You know a little bit about your wife.

696
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440
Oh, I can send Zippy.

697
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:33.210
Why would these people just be
waiting there in the driveway office?


698
00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.606
Well, clearly this was not your
garden variety decapitation.


699
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.208
This was some kind
of a, well, I don't know


700
00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.930
what it was, but they
know we have this thus.


701
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:43.590
Yeah?

702
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.410
Look, Mary, they can't find us.

703
00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.790
Maybe they're waiting for us to find them.

704
00:46:49.485 --> 00:46:51.006
That's the only place we know to call.

705
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.910
But why would we
get in touch with them?

706
00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:58.270
Set it back, shake them down, which,
incidentally, is not such a bad idea.


707
00:46:58.271 --> 00:46:59.271
Jamie.

708
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.390
Look, I didn't admit extortion.

709
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.730
Jamie, why would Suzanne
help us? She hates you.


710
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.530
Oh, she's had two days to cool off.

711
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.830
Get the fuck back in that locker.

712
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.321
Officer Krasig said I
could speak to my attorney.


713
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.830
Attorney, are you a college boy?

714
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.150
Officer Krasig said I
could speak to my lawyer.


715
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.350
Officer Krasig ain't running booking.

716
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.150
I'm running booking, jackass.

717
00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.710
You say... You want me to
walk over there with a kid?


718
00:47:25.711 --> 00:47:28.670
You're never running ass back
into the Delaware fucking river.


719
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.210
Who's running booking? You are.

720
00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:32.830
Who is? You are.

721
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.750
No fucking shit! Shane.

722
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:36.030
Yeah? Elbow.

723
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.250
Sergeant Shinkleman.

724
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.550
Hey, it's me.

725
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.630
Oh, what a lovely surprise.

726
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:46.070
Cynthia, come on now.

727
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:46.830
Let's be friends.

728
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.290
Did the two creeps find you?

729
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:49.890
What?

730
00:47:49.975 --> 00:47:51.370
Two weirdos looking for you.

731
00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:52.690
I tried to be helpful.

732
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:54.850
But who were they?

733
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:55.630
How should I know?

734
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.230
Bill collectors, herpes patients.

735
00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.430
Two more people you fucked over somehow.

736
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.490
George and Lenny?

737
00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.050
George and Lenny.

738
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:04.250
A licensee?

739
00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:05.710
Have you read any books?

740
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.430
Books, maybe not.

741
00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.906
But, sweetie, I'm going to help
you break a big murder case.


742
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:10.970
Break a big murder case?

743
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:15.870
Curly's pregnant?

744
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:20.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

745
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.210
Turn that around.

746
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.870
Ask him about the what
and he's how she feels?


747
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.850
Jamie, that is about the
dumbest thing I've ever heard.


748
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:31.210
And I'm a cop.

749
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:32.050
Why would I make it up?

750
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.366
Just go to Curly's driveway.

751
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:34.670
I guarantee you someone's there.

752
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:37.050
You guarantee I'm supposed to believe you.

753
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:38.070
Fine, you know what?

754
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:40.490
If no one's there, take Alice.

755
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:42.050
Really?

756
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:42.790
Swear? Yes, I swear.

757
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:44.890
A pussy bromance.

758
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.590
I'll take the dog.

759
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.370
You'll never have to be over there again.

760
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:50.630
That juke joint, where?

761
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:52.650
Wetunka, Alabama.

762
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.870
Well, outside of Wetunka,
they hadn't been there,


763
00:48:55.950 --> 00:49:01.510
but a very personable music
lover told us of another juke joint,


764
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.630
fairly close by, called
this... Ah! Called Ikes.


765
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:10.550
Maybe it's Ikes? 
It might crash.

766
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.570
But whatever, I think the
soccer team was just confused


767
00:49:14.571 --> 00:49:16.510
about which joint
these girls were going to.


768
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.550
So we're going to
draw... Stop saying words.


769
00:49:21.035 --> 00:49:23.070
One of the girls finally
used a credit card.


770
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:28.010
They arrived in Tallahassee and checked
into a hotel called Elk and Keystone Door.


771
00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.890
Tallahassee, I want you
to get your asses over there


772
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.910
and take care of it, right away.

773
00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:35.470
Not a juke joint.

774
00:49:35.935 --> 00:49:37.455
You should arrive there early morning.

775
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:38.750
I'll meet you there.

776
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:40.850
Um, a level with you, Chief.

777
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:42.890
Flint and me could use a little shut-eye.

778
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:46.130
We have not slouched since
the night before last and we...


779
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:47.670
Hello? Chief.

780
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:51.430
Who's in Tallahassee? Certainly.

781
00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:57.330
There are a number of places I can recommend
locally or right here at the hotel.


782
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.810
We have espadrilles for casual dining

783
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.490
or we have Baxter's by the pool,

784
00:50:01.675 --> 00:50:04.010
which is our more elegant
venue down in the lower level.


785
00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:07.190
Maybe we should stay here.

786
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:09.030
I wonder if the ice...

787
00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:14.125
This is great, but...

788
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.251
Ladies, sir, are we enjoying
the beverage this evening?


789
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.030
Yes.

790
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.890
Uh, can we get some champagne, please?

791
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.161
Like a really, really
good one? Of course.


792
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.310
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?


793
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:32.470
Yeah, right away.

794
00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:43.930
So...

795
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:50.510
I've been thinking about it
and... finally dawned on me that


796
00:50:50.511 --> 00:50:55.570
you are not the kind of person that a girl
brings to her roadside motel for a quiz.


797
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:59.190
Now, I have heard
of a more soulful sex

798
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.050
where you have a nice
dinner and conversation


799
00:51:02.051 --> 00:51:03.651
first so it all comes out
of someplace deeper,


800
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.090
but I usually have stuff to do.

801
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.770
There is with Billipope 95.

802
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.650
You mean, you want to sleep with me?

803
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.341
Marion, you've got to
have a good, skinny look.


804
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.790
Something I decided last
night while I was lying in bed


805
00:51:19.791 --> 00:51:24.130
before I started masturbating,
and I figure if it's more than me,


806
00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:26.111
I should take care of it myself.

807
00:51:27.445 --> 00:51:28.486
Especially since with you,

808
00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.470
it's got to be with
somebody who cares for you.


809
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.730
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your Clinton adios.


810
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.690
Thank you.

811
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:37.150
My pleasure.

812
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:38.750
Yes, please.

813
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.746
But... is it a good idea
for us to have sex?


814
00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:45.366
I mean, we're good friends, and maybe
it's not supposed to be more than that.


815
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:46.950
Maybe we shouldn't have screwed on yet.

816
00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:50.340
Look... you can always
find reasons to not have sex.


817
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:52.670
Hey, if you think about
them too much, guess what?


818
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.270
You never have sex.

819
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:55.150
Exactly.

820
00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:57.531
Like, my high school dad was counseling.

821
00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:00.850
She was always saying that
this or that would be inappropriate.


822
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.530
But when I finally got her to relax...

823
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:06.710
the sexual was great.

824
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.090
The ladies will be decided.

825
00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.940
Don't rush us, buddy.

826
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:16.851
First... we'll dance.

827
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.100
Maybe I do...

828
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.520
overthink things.

829
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.380
Yeah.

830
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.801
If I keep that friendly,
I just let that mind fly.


831
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.990
There's this one time I was with Debbie.

832
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:45.190
I was like,

833
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.710
you know Debbie.

834
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.730
She's got this humongous dildo.

835
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.890
She's got the mountain mountain on
the Black and Acres circular sanders.


836
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:53.610
And... she had me going.

837
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.426
Like, my brains were going to
come out of the top of my friggin' skull.


838
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:58.610
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfucker.


839
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:48.771
Like... One accomplishment.

840
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:51.230
Name me one.

841
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.630
At least how many are
in a dealing with people?


842
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:55.590
Those girls wound you up like they tap.

843
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.990
Flint!

844
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:59.310
Have you ever fucked a woman?

845
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:00.990
On a creaking porch swing?

846
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:02.250
On a warm summer evening?

847
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:02.690
Crickets?

848
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.270
So forth?

849
00:56:03.271 --> 00:56:05.950
I mean, just fuck turn
like there's no tomorrow.


850
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:07.830
Trousers are on your ankles,

851
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.910
belt jangling,

852
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:12.930
yelling to beat the band, slamming
away like a Cincinnati jackhammer.


853
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.990
Yes, people might stroll by,

854
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.930
so you look at foolish up there,
slapping ham on the veranda.


855
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:20.510
But that is the price
you pay for interaction.


856
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:22.650
If this is too messy for you,

857
00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:26.950
then you will spend the rest
of your miserable fucking life


858
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:28.890
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pod.


859
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:30.310
Can't wait to tell a chief.

860
00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:30.950
Yeah?

861
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.111
And why don't you also tell him
that you're a social fucking imbecile


862
00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.390
that I've been carrying on my back all
the way from Philadelphia? Big piece.


863
00:57:13.875 --> 00:57:16.090
Why would anybody
say it clearly? Yes, sir.


864
00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:59.720
Do you have any? I have.

865
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:42.270
I didn't have it.

866
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:44.970
Are you... ? No.

867
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:46.170
Is that good?

868
00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:49.350
Jamie, no!

869
00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:59.630
Jamie, why?

870
01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:05.330
Oh!

871
01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:05.870
Oh!

872
01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:07.030
Oh, my God!

873
01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:08.770
Mary!

874
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:10.870
Sir?

875
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.750
Sir?

876
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:16.110
Tell Hassey, sir.

877
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:17.970
Where to exactly? Ah, yes, um.

878
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.790
..

879
01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:22.791
The track.

880
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:24.310
The boat track? Yes, sir.

881
01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.530
Those penises were trouble, Jamie.

882
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.990
Oh, come on.

883
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.330
I thought you were going to loosen up.

884
01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.496
You're going to work your
way through all of them?


885
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.410
No. I like this one.

886
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.190
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

887
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:40.250
Last night was beautiful, but

888
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.886
you fell asleep and I didn't
get my turn on the water slide.


889
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:43.270
You know what I'm saying?

890
01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:45.270
Okay! Alright!

891
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.670
Hey, Mom!

892
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.030
We're number two!

893
01:00:49.031 --> 01:00:50.031
Good thing!

894
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.350
We're going that thing
fucking more off from you!


895
01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:55.510
We're here for two items.

896
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:57.210
Whoa. She's noticed.

897
01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.530
Alright, no big deal. 
Just mini-lady.

898
01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.090
We're here for two items? Yeah.

899
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.410
This, please, and thank you.

900
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:04.310
And the heads up.

901
01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:06.950
Fuck you! Don't you fucking let her in.

902
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.170
Alright, ladies. 
Okay, hold on.

903
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:10.710
Leave it back to you.

904
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.410
Come on. Go, man.

905
01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:15.070
Okay? Let's get this show on the road.

906
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:26.550
You're such a big, bouncy, beautiful baby.

907
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:30.050
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

908
01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:33.070
Whoa.

909
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.430
This is so pretty.

910
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:37.390
Yeah?

911
01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:39.430
I can love you forever.

912
01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:40.510
Whoa.

913
01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:54.270
And ever.

914
01:01:54.271 --> 01:01:55.271
And ever.

915
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.950
Get straight here.

916
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.090
I haven't debriefed it, Chief.

917
01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:24.810
Figured you wanted to do the talking.

918
01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:29.270
This is all they had.

919
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:31.030
What's all they had? Ladies.

920
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:35.770
You're a day late.

921
01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:37.030
And a dick short.

922
01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:38.770
What are you talking about?

923
01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:40.930
This senator's penis is not in the case.

924
01:02:41.635 --> 01:02:43.310
Nothing. Well, it just figures.

925
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.070
Come on, girls.

926
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.750
Where's the last phallus?

927
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:52.510
You didn't check the case before you left.

928
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:56.016
I... He's been stepping on his
feet the whole week down, Chief.


929
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.110
What have you
done? Sure, come on.


930
01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.926
The guy just ran this
guy's head putting stuff in.


931
01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:03.230
Then gave me the combination
and it still took you 15 minutes.


932
01:03:03.231 --> 01:03:06.250
You didn't have the first number.

933
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.180
The senator is a good man.

934
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.320
He spoke marijuana once in college.

935
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:27.820
And he was dead.

936
01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160
It was a different time.

937
01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.600
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick.

938
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.460
Tiffany Blastercaster.

939
01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.640
How do you mean?

940
01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:48.700
She took a plaster cast of his excited...

941
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.380
She made one model of each of her.

942
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640
Old men.

943
01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.860
At the time, the senator didn't know that

944
01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:04.340
someday he'd be called
on to serve his community,


945
01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.700
his state, and perhaps someday...

946
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.800
his nation.

947
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.470
He was just a kid.

948
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.990
His penis... passed
from hand to hand,


949
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:23.530
finally ended up with an international
collector named Alejandro Santos Yolandor.


950
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:25.810
You saw him.

951
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:27.650
Sort of.

952
01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:44.210
This penis cannot be of
a piece of merchandise.


953
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:46.470
Think of it.

954
01:04:46.995 --> 01:04:50.190
eBay, Senator Kerry channels
ding-dong, lightly used.


955
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.730
Comments, reviews.

956
01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:56.230
Think of what it would do to him.

957
01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.730
His children, his friends, his career.

958
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:06.310
We're not unreasonable.

959
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:08.710
We'll gladly pay for it.

960
01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:12.370
We just... No, you mean that!

961
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.190
That wasn't my idea!

962
01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:15.830
I was just trying to keep us awake.

963
01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:17.070
I was experimenting.

964
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:18.170
But you liked it.

965
01:05:18.171 --> 01:05:19.171
I did.

966
01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.550
It was the Irish copy.

967
01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:21.850
I was drunk.

968
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:22.210
Drunk, I can't.

969
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:22.790
No!

970
01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:24.490
It's not my thing.

971
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.570
I was just trying to help you
be a man to understand the light.


972
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:28.010
No!

973
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:28.770
The stuff!

974
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.990
No, no!

975
01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:31.030
No!

976
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:34.810
What are you doing?

977
01:06:31.985 --> 01:06:34.431
Alright, we have to get back to the
hotel and grab the penis out of bed.


978
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:35.730
Then, we switch hotels.

979
01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:38.230
You grab the penis,
I'll meet you in the hotel.


980
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:39.430
Okay, Malala and Turner.

981
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.670
I'll check in under the name, Abzug.

982
01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.210
Where are you going? Our store.

983
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:52.660
Thanks, customer, please.

984
01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.100
Shinkleman, we're going to Tallahassee.

985
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.760
Don't ask my line.

986
01:07:02.005 --> 01:07:03.870
I need to speak to the Senator.

987
01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.890
Well, who should I say is calling?

988
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:13.311
Someone who has
his... personal effects.


989
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:48.910
Yes.

990
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:50.470
Who is this?

991
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.870
Somebody who wants a million dollars.

992
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:55.211
You can get it by tonight.

993
01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:56.930
You can have your thing back.

994
01:07:57.330 --> 01:07:58.330
Everybody's thanks.

995
01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.461
I'll tell you where to bring the money.

996
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:01.670
Come alone.

997
01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:02.770
If you're not alone,

998
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:05.790
believe me, I'll know it.

999
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.191
Someone named Jamie Dolls
made a phone call from here last night.


1000
01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:19.370
Oh, yes.

1001
01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:22.070
Well, this is for her.

1002
01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:24.350
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1003
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:25.590
You missed them.

1004
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:27.870
Her friend just checked them out.

1005
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.060
Done.

1006
01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280
With what? Tell you later.

1007
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480
I'm going to clean up.

1008
01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:57.240
Want to join me? Jamie? I want.

1009
01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:32.170
..

1010
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.430
I...

1011
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:35.550
I want...

1012
01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:38.091
What do you want, Shirley?

1013
01:09:41.015 --> 01:09:42.930
I want to make love
with the Senator's penis.


1014
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:04.690
Who are you?

1015
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:09.550
Mind if we sit down?

1016
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.260
We didn't deserve this.

1017
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.040
This commodification.

1018
01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.420
These are all good people.

1019
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.040
Important people, too.

1020
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.240
Some of them.

1021
01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:56.900
There's the head of one of the
bigger Fortune 500 companies.


1022
01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.080
The owner of a large market football team.

1023
01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.020
The Supreme Court Justice.

1024
01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.870
You, little people,

1025
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:14.270
didn't make yourselves something
that was never meant for you.


1026
01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:16.780
Trafficking in other
people's attainments.


1027
01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:20.550
Senator, save the safety money.

1028
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:22.590
And hand over the million smackers.

1029
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:27.350
I used to believe in the
unfettered free market.


1030
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.260
Who's head, Senator?

1031
01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.660
Don't get lofty with me.

1032
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.360
Women.

1033
01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.780
Did we do the wrong thing?

1034
01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.801
What if he's the next president?

1035
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400
You girls are cute.

1036
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.061
My friends and me are having
a little basement party later.


1037
01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340
You want a joint? Not tonight.

1038
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.280
Sookie? There you are.

1039
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.740
Someone's got crackhead phone call now.

1040
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.080
What? What do you mean?

1041
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.200
How'd you know I'd be here?

1042
01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.260
Tell me Dyckbar's out there in Tallahassee.

1043
01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.600
What, are you an executive now?

1044
01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.581
Did they make you the president
of Little Miss Lyre Band's name?


1045
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.880
Oh, this? No, I just...

1046
01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:47.560
We thought they didn't know where
we were, but somehow they did,


1047
01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.840
and this morning they put us
in the back of a Toyota Tercel


1048
01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:52.960
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure they were gonna kill


1049
01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.920
us, but lucky for us, they left
the most important penis behind.


1050
01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:56.780
Wow.

1051
01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.040
You had a full day.

1052
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.500
She's yours now.

1053
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.460
Hang on.

1054
01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220
This doesn't look good.

1055
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:35.670
What's she chasing? Yeah.

1056
01:14:38.955 --> 01:14:41.750
We forgot to tell you about the
small guy's head in the hat box.


1057
01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.270
Boy, I think I could win against him.

1058
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:53.990
But now we get
to just keep on going.

1059
01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.410
Who's gonna complain when we leave the car?

1060
01:14:57.155 --> 01:14:58.770
Things could not have worked out better.

1061
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.910
Well, I guess.

1062
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.030
What's wrong?

1063
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:07.650
I am fully aware that the
senator is a terrible person,


1064
01:15:07.651 --> 01:15:09.470
but I have to
admit, I'll miss us.


1065
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:13.130
Don't worry, girl.

1066
01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.010
I'm a guest.

1067
01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:16.890
And two puppies.

1068
01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:21.290
Great, but why
two? For each other.


1069
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.210
Ladies and visitors here.

1070
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:26.930
Can we get our car? You know.

1071
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.990
Hers and hers.

1072
01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:31.250
And Ellis.

1073
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:38.770
Oh, hello, darling.

1074
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:40.510
She's your eighth, Anna.

1075
01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:42.050
And we've done better in church.

1076
01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:43.771
Watch what she sees. 
She's very religious.

1077
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:45.410
So good to see you.

1078
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400
This is my friend Jamie.

1079
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:49.550
Hi, you young lady.

1080
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:51.506
Is this your first time in
Tallahassee? Yes, ma'am.


1081
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:53.950
And what a beautiful city.

1082
01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:55.490
Not like Miami.

1083
01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:56.650
Oh, no, no.

1084
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:58.190
Not like Miami.

1085
01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:00.890
You able to stay with us long?

1086
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:02.110
No, unfortunately I am.

1087
01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:03.730
We're off to Massachusetts.

1088
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:05.450
Just decided last night.

1089
01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.750
But where do they have in
Massachusetts that we don't have right now?


1090
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:09.850
Miami and North Florida.

1091
01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:11.990
Women can get married there.

1092
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.990
To each other.

1093
01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840
That's an innovation.
