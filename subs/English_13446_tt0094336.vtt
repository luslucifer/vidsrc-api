00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.248
I'm going for a cup of
tea. Do you want one?


2
00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:09.094
<i>- Do you want a cup of tea, Withnail?
- No.</i>


3
00:03:58.377 --> 00:04:01.244
<i>Thirteen million Londoners
have to wake up to this.</i>


4
00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:04.248
<i>The murder and all-bran and rape?</i>

5
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.842
<i>And I'm sitting in this bloody
shack, and I can't cope with Withnail.</i>


6
00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:10.012
<i>I must be out of my mind.</i>

7
00:04:10.122 --> 00:04:13.182
<i>I must go home at once and
discuss his problems in depth.</i>


8
00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:18.657
I have some extremely distressing news.

9
00:04:18.764 --> 00:04:21.756
<i>I don't want to hear it. I
don't want to hear anything.</i>


10
00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:26.964
<i>My God, it's a nightmare, let
me tell you. It's a nightmare.</i>


11
00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:30.064
We've just run out of wine.
What are we gonna do about it?


12
00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:32.666
<i>I don't know. 
I don't know.</i>

13
00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:35.804
Oh, God! I don't feel good.

14
00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:40.113
My thumbs have gone weird!

15
00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.484
I'm in the middle of a bloody overdose.

16
00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:46.558
Oh, God!

17
00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.719
My heart's beating like a fucked clock!

18
00:04:49.828 --> 00:04:52.262
I feel dreadful. 
I feel really dreadful.

19
00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:54.730
So do I. So does everybody.

20
00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.858
Look at my tongue.

21
00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.437
Gray yellow sock.

22
00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:02.268
Sit down, for Christ's sake.
What's the matter with you?


23
00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:06.404
Eat some sugar.

24
00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:09.879
Listen to this. "Curse of the supermen.

37

Look at him! Look at Jeff Wode!

38
00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:58.996
His head must weigh

39

Imagine the size of his balls.

40
00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:07.438
Imagine getting into a
fight with the fucker.

Please, I don't feel good.

That's what you'd say. But
that wouldn't wash with Jeff.


43
00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.706
No. He'd like a bit of
pleading. Adds spice to it.


44
00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:22.981
In fact, he'd probably tell you what
he was gonna do before he did it.

48

Have you got soup? Why
didn't I get any soup?


49
00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:43.575
Coffee.

50
00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:45.836
Why don't you use a cup
like any other human being?


51
00:06:45.944 --> 00:06:48.742
Why don't you wash up occasionally

How dare you! How dare you!

How dare you call me inhumane!

54
00:06:55.287 --> 00:06:58.279
I didn't call you inhumane. You
merely imagined it. Calm down.


55
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.223
Right, you fucker. I'm
gonna do the washing up.


56
00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:04.489
No, no, you can't. It's
impossible, I swear.


57
00:07:04.596 --> 00:07:07.326
I've looked into it.
Listen to me! Listen to me!


58
00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:10.266
There are things in there.
There's a tea bag growing.


59
00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.634
You haven't slept in 60 hours.
You're in no state to tackle it.


60
00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:16.207
Wait till the morning.
We'll go in together.


61
00:07:16.308 --> 00:07:18.936
This is the morning! Stand aside!

62
00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:23.003
You don't understand! I think there
may be something living in there.


63
00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:25.379
I think there may be something alive.

64
00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:28.248
- What do you mean? A rat?
- It's possible.


65
00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:31.413
Then the fucker will rue the day.

66
00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:37.996
Oh, Christ Almighty! A
sinew in nicotine base.


67
00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:41.555
Keep back, keep back. The
entire sink's gone rotten.


68
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:43.567
I don't know what's in here.

69
00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.799
I told you, you've been bitten!

70
00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:50.636
Burnt! Burnt! The
fucking kettle's on fire!


71
00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:53.210
- There's something floating up.
- Fork it!


72
00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:56.804
- L-I-I don't... -
You must! You must!


73
00:07:56.915 --> 00:08:01.011
<i>The poop will boil through the glaze. We'll
never be able to use our dinner service again.</i>


74
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.520
Here. Get it with the pliers.

75
00:08:03.622 --> 00:08:06.022
<i>No, no. No, no. 
Give me the gloves.</i>

76
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.821
That's right. Put on the gloves.

77
00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:11.828
Don't attempt anything
without the gloves.


78
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.101
- Ugh.
- What is it? What have you found?


79
00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:20.831
Matter.

80
00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:23.430
Matter? Where's it coming from?

81
00:08:23.542 --> 00:08:26.534
Don't look. I'm dealing with it.

82
00:08:28.614 --> 00:08:30.980
I think we've been in here too long.

83
00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:34.712
I feel unusual. I think
we should go outside.


84
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:42.726
This is ridiculous. Look at me.

85
00:08:42.828 --> 00:08:46.320
I'm 30 in a month, and I've
got a sole flapping off my shoe.


86
00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:49.423
It will get better. It has to.

87
00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:52.470
Easy for you to say, lovey.
You've had an audition.


88
00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:55.039
Why can't I have an audition?

89
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.839
It's ridiculous. I've been to
drama school. I'm good-looking.


90
00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:04.041
I tell you, I've a fuck sight more talent
than half the rubbish that gets on television.


91
00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:06.242
Why can't I get on television?

92
00:09:06.351 --> 00:09:08.581
I don't know. It'll happen.

93
00:09:08.687 --> 00:09:11.247
Will it? That's what you say.

94
00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:14.951
The only program I'm likely
to get on is the fucking news.


95
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.528
I tell you, I can't
take much more of this.


96
00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:20.063
- I'm gonna crack.
- I'm in the same boat.


97
00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:22.065
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:24.761
I feel as sick as a pike.

99
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.997
I'm gonna have to sit down.

100
00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:35.271
You know what we should do?

101
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.008
I say, you know what we should do?

102
00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:41.108
How can I possibly
know what we should do?


103
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.747
- What should we do?
- Get out of it for a while.


104
00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:47.620
Get into the countryside, rejuvenate.

105
00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:51.753
Rejuvenate? I'm in a park,
and I'm practically dead.


106
00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:54.764
What good's the countryside?

107
00:09:54.866 --> 00:09:59.030
- What time is it?
- It's 8:00.


108
00:09:59.137 --> 00:10:03.540
Four hours till opening
time. God help us.


109
00:10:03.642 --> 00:10:06.042
Have we got any embrocation?

110
00:10:08.013 --> 00:10:10.481
- What for?
- To rub on us, you fool.


111
00:10:10.582 --> 00:10:13.676
We can cover ourselves in Deep Heat
and get up against the radiator,


112
00:10:13.785 --> 00:10:16.253
keep ourselves alive till 12:00.

113
00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:20.490
Jesus, look at that!

114
00:10:20.592 --> 00:10:23.390
Apart from a raw potato,
that's the only solid...


115
00:10:23.495 --> 00:10:26.623
to have passed my lips
in the last 60 hours.


116
00:10:26.732 --> 00:10:29.132
I must be ill.

117
00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:35.237
<i>Even a stopped clock gives
the right time twice a day.</i>


118
00:10:36.742 --> 00:10:40.701
<i>And for once, I'm inclined to
believe that Withnail is right.</i>


119
00:10:40.812 --> 00:10:45.249
<i>We are, indeed, drifting
into the arena of the unwell,</i>


120
00:10:47.085 --> 00:10:50.077
<i>making an enemy of our own future.</i>

121
00:10:50.188 --> 00:10:53.157
<i>What we need is harmony,</i>

122
00:10:53.258 --> 00:10:56.352
<i>fresh air, stuff like that.</i>

123
00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:59.953
Wasn't much in the tube.
Nothing left for you.


124
00:11:00.065 --> 00:11:03.364
<i>Why don't you ask your
father for some money?</i>


125
00:11:03.468 --> 00:11:06.437
If we had some
money, we could go away.

126
00:11:06.538 --> 00:11:10.201
Why don't you ask your father?
How can it be so cold in here?


127
00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:12.641
Like Greenland in here.

128
00:11:14.413 --> 00:11:18.873
We've got to get some booze. It's the
only solution for this intense cold.


129
00:11:18.984 --> 00:11:23.080
Something's got to be done.
We can't go on like this!


130
00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:27.386
I'm a trained actor reduced
to the status of a bum!


131
00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:32.191
I mean, look at us! Nothing that reasonable
members of society demand as their rights!


132
00:11:32.297 --> 00:11:35.528
No fridges, no televisions, no phones!

133
00:11:35.634 --> 00:11:37.966
Much more of this, I'm gonna
apply for Meals On Wheels.


134
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.972
- What happened to your cigar commercial?
- That's what I want to know.


135
00:11:42.074 --> 00:11:45.271
What happened to my agent?
Bastard must have died.


136
00:11:45.377 --> 00:11:47.277
<i>September. Bad patch.</i>

137
00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:50.507
Rubbish. I haven't seen
Gielgud down the Labor Exchange.


138
00:11:50.615 --> 00:11:52.515
Why doesn't he retire?

139
00:11:52.617 --> 00:11:55.518
Oh, look at this little bastard!

140
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.953
"Boy lands plum role for
top Italian director. "


141
00:11:59.057 --> 00:12:03.118
'Course he does. Probably on a
tenner a day, and I know what for.


142

Two pound ten a tit,

- Have you been at the controls?
- What are you talking about?

The thermostats! What
have you done to them?


145

<i>- I haven't touched them.
- Then why has my head gone numb?</i>


146
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.201
I must have some booze.

147
00:12:21.313 --> 00:12:24.043
I demand to have some booze!

148
00:12:26.184 --> 00:12:28.914
- I wouldn't drink that if I was you.
- Why not?


149
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.920
Because I don't advise it.

00:12:31.022 --> 00:12:33.923
Even the wankers on the site wouldn't
drink that. That's worse than meths.


151
00:12:34.025 --> 00:12:36.994
Nonsense. This is a far
superior drink to meths.


152
00:12:37.095 --> 00:12:39.962
Wankers don't drink it
because they can't afford it.


153
00:12:44.336 --> 00:12:47.305
Have we got any more?

154
00:12:47.406 --> 00:12:50.136
Liar! What's in your toolbox?

155
00:12:50.242 --> 00:12:52.301
No, we have nothing. Sit down.

156
00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:54.811
Liar! You've got antifreeze.

157
00:12:54.913 --> 00:12:57.814
You bloody fool. You should
never mix your drinks!


158
00:13:06.691 --> 00:13:10.593
All right, this is the plan.
We'll get in there and get wrecked.


159
00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:14.631
Then we'll eat a pork pie. Then we'll
drop a couple of Surmontil 50s each.


160
00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:18.169
Means we'll miss out Monday but
come up smiling Tuesday morning.


161
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.671
- What's that appalling smell?
- Perfume on my boots.


162
00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:24.833
I had to scrub them
with essence of petunia.


163
00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:36.144
Two large gins, two pints
of cider, ice in the cider.


164
00:13:36.254 --> 00:13:38.814
If my father was loaded,
I'd ask him for some money.


165
00:13:38.924 --> 00:13:41.688
If your father was my
father, you wouldn't get it.


166
00:13:41.793 --> 00:13:44.193
- Here you are,
lads. - Chin-chin.


167
00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:49.866
Ugh!

168
00:13:51.403 --> 00:13:54.031
What about
what's-his-name?


169
00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:57.472
- What about him?
- Why don't you give him a call?


170
00:13:57.576 --> 00:14:01.012
- What for?
- Ask him about his house.


171
00:14:01.112 --> 00:14:04.206
You want me to call what's-his-name
and ask him about his house?


172
00:14:04.316 --> 00:14:07.649
- Why not?
- All right. What's his number?


173
00:14:07.752 --> 00:14:10.414
I have no idea. 
I've never met him.

174
00:14:10.522 --> 00:14:13.423
Well, neither have I. Who the
fuck are you talking about?


175
00:14:13.525 --> 00:14:15.857
Your relative with the
house in the country.


176
00:14:15.961 --> 00:14:18.623
- Monty? Uncle Monty?
- Same. That's the one.


177
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.699
Get the Jag fixed up, spend
a week in the country.


178
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.600
All right. Give us a tanner,
and I'll give him a bell.


179
00:14:25.704 --> 00:14:30.198
Here. Get a couple more.
I'm going for a slash.


180
00:14:37.148 --> 00:14:39.048
Ponce.

181
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.716
<i>I could hardly piss straight with fear.</i>

182
00:14:44.823 --> 00:14:48.384
<i>A man with three-quarters of an inch
of brain had taken a dislike to me.</i>


183
00:14:48.493 --> 00:14:52.896
<i>What have I done to offend him? I don't
consciously offend big men like this.</i>


184
00:14:52.998 --> 00:14:55.899
<i>And this one has a definite
imbalance of hormone in him.</i>


185
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:59.129
<i>Get any more masculine than him,
you'd have to live up a tree.</i>


186
00:14:59.237 --> 00:15:02.468
<i>"I fuck arses. " Who fucks arses?</i>

187
00:15:02.574 --> 00:15:05.270
<i>Maybe he fucks arses.</i>

188
00:15:05.377 --> 00:15:08.505
<i>Maybe he's written this in some
moment of drunken sincerity?</i>


189
00:15:08.613 --> 00:15:11.081
<i>I'm in considerable danger in here.</i>

190
00:15:11.182 --> 00:15:13.173
<i>I must get out of here at once.</i>

191
00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:19.683
Perfumed ponce!

192
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.791
You'll be pleased to hear
Monty's invited us for drinks.


193
00:15:24.896 --> 00:15:27.091
Balls to Monty. 
We're getting out.

194
00:15:27.198 --> 00:15:30.326
Balls to Monty? I already spent
an hour flattering the bugger.


195
00:15:30.435 --> 00:15:34.371
There's a man over there doesn't like
the perfume. A big one. Don't look.


196
00:15:34.472 --> 00:15:37.202
We're in danger. 
We've got to get out.

197
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:41.336
- What are you talking about?
- I've been called a ponce.


198
00:15:41.446 --> 00:15:44.574
What fucker said that?

199
00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:53.090
I called him a ponce,

200
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:55.557
and now I'm calling you one.

201
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.787
Ponce!

202
00:15:57.896 --> 00:16:00.228
Would you like a drink?

203
00:16:00.332 --> 00:16:02.357
What's your name? McFuck?

204
00:16:03.735 --> 00:16:07.296
I have a heart condition.
I have a heart condition.


205
00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:10.135
If you hit me, it's murder.

206
00:16:10.241 --> 00:16:12.937
I'll murder the pair of yous!

207
00:16:13.044 --> 00:16:15.740
My wife is having a baby.

208
00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:20.375
<i>Listen, I don't know what my...
acquaintance did to upset you,</i>


209
00:16:20.485 --> 00:16:23.010
but it's nothing to do with me.

210
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:25.749
I suggest you both go outside...

211
00:16:25.857 --> 00:16:28.621
and discuss it sensibly in the street.

212
00:16:31.296 --> 00:16:33.196
Out of my way!

213
00:16:38.937 --> 00:16:41.929
<i>Speed is like a dozen
transatlantic flights...</i>


214
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.406
<i>without ever getting off the plane.</i>

215
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:48.605
<i>Time change. You lose. You gain.</i>

216
00:16:48.713 --> 00:16:52.740
<i>Makes no difference, so long
as you keep taking the pills.</i>


217
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:55.684
<i>But sooner or later,
you gotta get out...</i>


218
00:16:55.787 --> 00:16:57.914
<i>because it's crashing,</i>

219
00:16:58.023 --> 00:17:01.015
<i>and all at once those frozen hours...</i>

220
00:17:01.126 --> 00:17:03.754
<i>melt through the nervous system...</i>

221
00:17:03.862 --> 00:17:07.025
<i>and seep out the pores.</i>

222
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:11.530
Bastards! Just to suck...

223
00:17:11.636 --> 00:17:15.094
some miserable cheap cigar,
and the bastards won't see me.


224
00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:19.610
Why are we having lunch in here?

225
00:17:19.711 --> 00:17:21.702
It's dinner, and Danny's here.

226
00:17:21.813 --> 00:17:23.713
Danny? How did he get in?

227
00:17:23.815 --> 00:17:26.579
I let him in this morning.
He lost one of his clogs.


228
00:17:26.685 --> 00:17:29.313
He's come in because
of this perpetual cold.


229
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:32.254
Oh, I hope tobacco sales plummet.

230
00:17:32.357 --> 00:17:36.293
I've got your saveloy.
Here. I don't want it.


231
00:17:36.394 --> 00:17:39.158
Then stick it in a soap
tray and save it for later.


232
00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:41.926
Don't vent spleen on
me! I'm in the same boat!


233
00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:44.866
Stop saying that! You're
not in the same boat.


234
00:17:44.969 --> 00:17:49.406
The only thing you're in that I
have been in is this fucking bath!


235
00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:55.908
<i>Danny's here. 
Headhunter to his friends.</i>

236
00:17:56.014 --> 00:17:59.916
<i>Headhunter to everybody.
He doesn't have any friends.</i>


237
00:18:00.018 --> 00:18:02.748
<i>The only people he converses with...</i>

238
00:18:02.854 --> 00:18:05.755
<i>are his clients and
occasionally the police.</i>


239
00:18:05.857 --> 00:18:10.760
<i>The purveyor of rare herbs and
prescribed chemicals is back.</i>


240
00:18:10.862 --> 00:18:13.888
<i>Will we never be set free?</i>

241
00:18:18.536 --> 00:18:22.063
- Danny.
- You're looking very beautiful, man.


242
00:18:22.173 --> 00:18:24.073
Have you been away?

243
00:18:24.175 --> 00:18:28.236
St. Peter preached the epistles
to the apostles looking like that.


244
00:18:28.346 --> 00:18:30.678
Have you got any food?

245
00:18:30.782 --> 00:18:34.183
Mmm. As a matter of
fact, I got a saveloy.


246
00:18:34.285 --> 00:18:37.152
How much is it?

247
00:18:37.255 --> 00:18:39.450
You can have it for nothing.

248
00:18:39.557 --> 00:18:42.617
- I see you're wearing a suit.
- What's it got to do with you?


249
00:18:42.727 --> 00:18:46.959
<i>No need to get uptight, man. I
was merely making an observation.</i>


250
00:18:47.065 --> 00:18:51.593
<i>I happened to be looking for a
suit for the Coalman two weeks ago.</i>


251
00:18:51.703 --> 00:18:54.934
For reasons I can't
really discuss with you...


252
00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:57.633
the Coalman had to go to Jamaica.

253
00:18:57.742 --> 00:19:00.506
Got busted coming back through Heathrow.

254
00:19:03.615 --> 00:19:05.515
Had a weight under his fez.

255
00:19:05.617 --> 00:19:09.747
<i>We worked out, it would be very handy
karma for him to get hold of a suit.</i>


256
00:19:09.854 --> 00:19:13.221
But he's a very low-temperature
spade, the Coalman.


257
00:19:13.324 --> 00:19:16.293
Goes into court in
his caftan and a bell.


258
00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:20.330
This doesn't go down at all well.

259
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:23.992
They can handle the caftan,
but they can't handle the bell.


260
00:19:24.102 --> 00:19:27.663
So there's this judge sitting there
in the cape like fucking Batman...


261
00:19:27.772 --> 00:19:31.333
<i>- with this really rather
far-out looking hat... - Wig.</i>


262
00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:35.503
<i>No, man. This was more
like a long white hat.</i>


263
00:19:35.613 --> 00:19:38.138
So he looks at the Coalman and says,

264
00:19:38.249 --> 00:19:41.844
"What's all this? This is a court,
man. This ain't fancy dress. "


265
00:19:41.953 --> 00:19:44.649
And the Coalman looks at him and says,

266
00:19:44.756 --> 00:19:47.782
"You think you look normal, Your Honor?"

267
00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:50.918
Cunt give him two years.

268
00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:55.991
I'm afraid I can't offer
you gentlemen anything.


269
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.830
That's all right, Danny. We
decided to lay off for a bit.


270
00:19:58.937 --> 00:20:02.703
That's what I thought. Except for
personal use, I concur with you.


271
00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:07.210
As a matter of fact, I'm thinking
of retiring and going into business.


272
00:20:07.312 --> 00:20:09.803
Doing what?

273
00:20:09.914 --> 00:20:13.145
<i>- The toy industry.
- I thought you were in the bottle industry.</i>


274
00:20:13.251 --> 00:20:17.415
No, man. That's a
sideline. You can have that.


275
00:20:17.522 --> 00:20:20.252
Instructions are included.

276
00:20:20.358 --> 00:20:24.522
Yeah, my partner's got a really
good idea for making dolls.


277
00:20:24.629 --> 00:20:29.191
His name's Presuming Ed.
His sister give him the idea.


278
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.996
She got a doll on Christmas
what pisses itself.


279
00:20:32.103 --> 00:20:35.539
- Really?
- Yeah, and you gotta change its drawers for it.


280
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.666
It's horrible, really. But
they like that, little girls.


281
00:20:38.776 --> 00:20:41.677
So we're gonna make one
that shits itself as well.


282
00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:44.373
- Shits itself?
- He's an expert.


283
00:20:44.482 --> 00:20:47.246
He's building the prototype now.

284
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:52.182
Why is he behaving so uptightly?

285
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.249
Because a gang of cheeroot vendors
considered a haircut beyond my abilities.


286
00:20:56.361 --> 00:20:59.262
I don't advise a haircut, man.

287
00:20:59.364 --> 00:21:02.527
All hairdressers are in the
employment of the government.


288
00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:04.795
Hair are your aerials.

289
00:21:04.903 --> 00:21:07.371
They pick up signals from the cosmos...

290
00:21:07.472 --> 00:21:10.270
and transmit them
directly into the brain.


291
00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:13.503
This is the reason
bald-headed men are uptight.


292
00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:15.943
What absolute twaddle.

293
00:21:17.382 --> 00:21:19.282
- Has he just been busted?
- No.


294
00:21:19.384 --> 00:21:21.614
Then why is he wearing that old suit?

295
00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:25.780
Old suit? This suit was cut
by Hawke's of Savile Row.


296
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.849
Just because the best tailoring you've ever seen is
above your fucking appendix doesn't mean anything!


297
00:21:29.961 --> 00:21:32.452
Don't get uptight with me, man.

298
00:21:32.563 --> 00:21:37.091
'Cause if you do, I'll have
to give you a dose of medicine.


299
00:21:37.201 --> 00:21:41.297
And if I spike you, you'll
know you've been spoken to.


300
00:21:41.406 --> 00:21:44.136
You wouldn't spike me. 
You're too mean.

301
00:21:44.242 --> 00:21:47.143
Besides, there's nothing
invented I couldn't take.


302
00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:52.080
If I medicined you, you'd think a
brain tumor was a birthday present.


303
00:21:53.918 --> 00:21:57.012
I could take double anything you could.

304
00:21:58.923 --> 00:22:02.324
Very, very foolish words, man.

305
00:22:02.427 --> 00:22:04.827
He's right, Withnail. Look at him.

306
00:22:04.929 --> 00:22:07.830
His mechanism's gone. He's had more
drugs than you've had hot dinners.


307
00:22:07.932 --> 00:22:10.366
I'm not having this
shag sack insulting me.


308
00:22:10.468 --> 00:22:12.663
Let him get his drugs out.

309
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.638
This doll is extremely dangerous.

310
00:22:18.476 --> 00:22:22.412
It has voodoo qualities.

311
00:22:31.456 --> 00:22:37.122
Trade, "Phenodihydrochrolide benzorex. "

312
00:22:37.228 --> 00:22:40.527
Street, "the embalmer. "

313
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:42.861
Balls! I'll swallow it and run a mile.

314
00:22:42.967 --> 00:22:47.666
Cool your boots, man. This
pill's valued at two quid.


315
00:22:47.772 --> 00:22:50.673
- Two quid? You're out of your mind.
- That's sense, Withnail.


316
00:22:50.775 --> 00:22:54.302
You can stuff it up your arse for nothing
and fuck off while you're doing it!


317
00:22:56.814 --> 00:23:01.308
<i>No need to insult me,
man. I was leaving anyway.</i>


318
00:23:04.655 --> 00:23:07.818
Have either of you got shoes?

319
00:23:33.351 --> 00:23:35.819
Monty's car.

320
00:23:44.362 --> 00:23:47.354
Oh, hello! Come in.

321
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.137
Sit down, do. Would you like a drink?

322
00:23:59.243 --> 00:24:01.336
- Sherry.
- Sherry.


323
00:24:04.449 --> 00:24:06.349
- Sherry?
- Sherry.


324
00:24:06.451 --> 00:24:08.351
Sherry.

325
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.950
Do you like vegetables?

326
00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:17.789
I've always been fond of root crops,

327
00:24:17.895 --> 00:24:20.420
but I only started to grow last summer.

328
00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:24.126
I happen to think the cauliflower
more beautiful than the rose.


329
00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:26.135
Chin-chin.

330
00:24:26.237 --> 00:24:28.637
- Do you grow?
- Geraniums.


331
00:24:28.739 --> 00:24:30.832
Little traitors.

332
00:24:30.942 --> 00:24:34.173
I think the carrot infinitely
more fascinating than the geranium.


333
00:24:34.278 --> 00:24:37.736
Mmm. The carrot has mystery.

334
00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:40.875
Flowers are essentially tarts,

335
00:24:40.985 --> 00:24:44.011
prostitutes for the bees.

336
00:24:45.423 --> 00:24:48.483
<i>There is, you will agree,
a certain "je ne sai quoi,"</i>


337
00:24:48.593 --> 00:24:52.256
something very special
about a firm, young carrot.


338
00:24:52.363 --> 00:24:54.490
Hmm, excuse me.

339
00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:58.160
Do help yourselves to another drink.

340
00:24:58.269 --> 00:25:00.737
What's all this? 
The man's mad.

341
00:25:00.838 --> 00:25:03.398
- Eccentric.
- Eccentric? He's insane!


342
00:25:03.508 --> 00:25:06.102
Not only that, he's a raving homosexual.

343
00:25:08.212 --> 00:25:10.476
<i>You beastly little
parasite! How dare you?</i>


344
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:13.345
You little thug! How dare you!

345
00:25:15.987 --> 00:25:18.547
Beastly, ungrateful little swine!

346
00:25:18.656 --> 00:25:22.387
- Shall I get you a drink?
- Yes, yes, yes, please, dear boy.


347
00:25:22.493 --> 00:25:25.053
You can prepare me a small
rhesus-negative Bloody Mary.


348
00:25:25.163 --> 00:25:29.293
You must tell me all the news. I haven't
seen you since you finished your last show.


349
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.198
Rather busy, Uncle. TV and stuff.

350
00:25:32.303 --> 00:25:35.602
My agent's attempting to edge me
towards Royal Shakespeare Company again.


351
00:25:35.706 --> 00:25:39.608
<i>- Oh, splendid.
- And he's just had an audition for rep.</i>


352
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.873
Oh, splendid! So you're a Thespian too?

353
00:25:46.317 --> 00:25:48.308
Monty used to act.

354
00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:50.319
One hardly says that.

355
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:53.982
I cracked the boards in my youth,
but I never really had it in my blood.


356
00:25:54.091 --> 00:25:56.651
And that's what's so
essential, isn't it?


357
00:25:56.761 --> 00:25:59.195
The theatrical zeal in the veins.

358
00:25:59.297 --> 00:26:03.358
Alas, I have little more than
vintage wine and memories.


359
00:26:07.672 --> 00:26:11.403
It is the most shattering
experience of a young man's life...


360
00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:15.411
when one morning he awakes and
quite reasonably says to himself,


361
00:26:15.513 --> 00:26:20.974
"I will never play the Dane. "

362
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:24.248
When that moment comes,

363
00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:27.813
one's ambition ceases.

364
00:26:30.194 --> 00:26:32.685
Don't you agree?

365
00:26:32.797 --> 00:26:36.597
- It's a part I intend to play, Uncle.
- And you'll be marvelous.


366
00:26:36.701 --> 00:26:38.999
Marvelous.

367
00:26:40.404 --> 00:26:42.964
"It's gone.

368
00:26:43.074 --> 00:26:46.271

369
00:26:46.377 --> 00:26:49.107

370
00:26:49.213 --> 00:26:52.307
Let's go. He's a madman.

371
00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:55.180
Any minute now, he's gonna rush
out and get into his tights.


372
00:26:55.286 --> 00:26:59.120
- Okay, okay. Any minute.
- The house or out.


373
00:27:01.058 --> 00:27:03.253
Could I have a word with you, Monty?

374
00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:06.296
Oh, forgive me, dear boy. Forgive me.

375
00:27:06.397 --> 00:27:09.457
<i>I was allowing memory
to have the better of me.</i>


376
00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:12.468
<i>Shall I get you a topper?</i>

377
00:27:21.412 --> 00:27:24.973
Indeed, I remember my first agent.

378
00:27:25.082 --> 00:27:27.209
Raymond Duck.

379
00:27:29.053 --> 00:27:32.045
He was a dreadful little Israelite.

380
00:27:32.156 --> 00:27:35.125
Four floors up on the
Charing Cross Road,


381
00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:38.024
and never a job
at the top of them.

382
00:27:39.864 --> 00:27:42.662
I'm told you're a writer too.

383
00:27:44.602 --> 00:27:47.093
<i>Do you write poems?</i>

384
00:27:47.204 --> 00:27:51.163
No. I wish I could. It's
just thoughts, really.


385
00:27:52.877 --> 00:27:55.345
- Are you published?
- Oh, no.


386
00:27:55.446 --> 00:27:57.676
Where did you school?

387
00:27:57.782 --> 00:28:00.410
He went to the other place, Monty.

388
00:28:00.518 --> 00:28:03.749
Oh, you went to Eton?

389
00:28:03.854 --> 00:28:06.550
Get that damned little
swine out of here!


390
00:28:08.659 --> 00:28:12.459
It's trying to get itself in with you.
It's trying for even more advantage.


391
00:28:12.563 --> 00:28:14.724
It's obsessed with its gut. It's
like a bloody rugby ball now.


392
00:28:14.832 --> 00:28:18.131
- It will die! It will die!
- Monty. Monty.


393
00:28:18.235 --> 00:28:21.033
No, no, dear boy. 
You must leave.

394
00:28:21.138 --> 00:28:23.504
Yet again, that oaf
has destroyed my day.


395
00:28:23.607 --> 00:28:26.633
Listen, Monty. Could I just have
a quick word with you? In private?


396
00:28:26.744 --> 00:28:28.905
Oh... very well.

397
00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:43.383
- Good night, my dears.
- Good night, Monty.


398
00:28:43.494 --> 00:28:46.952
What's all this going off in private
business? Why did you tell him I went to Eton?


399
00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:49.897
Because it wouldn't
have helped if I hadn't.


400
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.231
I'm just trying to establish you in
some sort of context he'd understand.


401
00:28:53.337 --> 00:28:57.034
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean, free to those who can afford it.


402
00:28:57.141 --> 00:28:59.905
Very expensive to those that can't.

Throwing themselves into the road

At some point or another, I want

416
00:31:03.234 --> 00:31:05.134
What do you want a child for?

417
00:31:05.236 --> 00:31:07.363
To tutor it in the
ways of righteousness...


418
00:31:07.471 --> 00:31:09.769
and procure some uncontaminated urine.

419
00:31:09.874 --> 00:31:14.208
This is a device enabling the drunken
driver to operate in absolute safety.

You fill this with piss, take
this pipe down the trouser...


421
00:31:19.316 --> 00:31:23.480
and cellotape this valve
to the end of the old chap.


422
00:31:23.587 --> 00:31:27.455
Then you get horribly drunk,
and they can't fucking touch you.


423
00:31:27.558 --> 00:31:30.550
According to these instructions,

424
00:31:30.661 --> 00:31:33.721
you refuse everything
but a urine sample.


425
00:31:33.831 --> 00:31:36.561
You undo your valve...

426
00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:40.262
and give 'em a dose of
unadulterated child's piss,


427
00:31:40.371 --> 00:31:43.397
and they have to give
you your keys back.

- No, we're not. We're here.

We're in the middle of a fucking gale.

431
00:33:15.265 --> 00:33:17.825
You'll have to keep
a look out your side.


432
00:33:17.935 --> 00:33:20.768
If you see anything, tell
me. Get hold of that map.


433
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:23.601
- Where's the whiskey?
- What for?


434
00:33:23.707 --> 00:33:26.267
I got a bastard behind the eyes.

435
00:33:26.377 --> 00:33:29.175
I can't take aspirins without a drink.

436
00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:32.180
- Where's the aspirins?
- Probably in the bathroom.


437
00:33:32.282 --> 00:33:35.979
We've come out here in the middle
of nowhere without aspirins?


438
00:33:36.086 --> 00:33:39.351
- Where are we?
- How should I know where we are?

I feel like a
pig shat in my head.

Get hold of that map and look
for a place called Crow Crag.

There must and shall be aspirin.

442
00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:11.846
Give me the keys. 
Get out of the way.

- Sitting down to enjoy my holiday.


448
00:35:38.776 --> 00:35:42.075
Right. Now, we're gonna have
to approach this scientifically.


449
00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:44.977
First thing we've got to
do is get this fire alight.


450
00:35:45.082 --> 00:35:47.312
Then we split into two
fact-finding groups.


451
00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:49.851
I'll deal with the
water and other plumbing.


452
00:35:49.953 --> 00:35:52.615
You can check the fuel
and wood situation.


453
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.661
- What's that?
- The fuel and wood situation.


454
00:35:59.763 --> 00:36:02.755
There's nothing out
there except a hurricane.


455
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.898
- This place is uninhabitable.
- Give it a chance. It's got to warm up.


456
00:36:10.007 --> 00:36:13.101
Warm up? We may as well
sit around a cigarette.


457
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.770
This is ridiculous.

458
00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:19.212
We'll be found dead in here next spring.

459
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.214
I've got a blinding fucking headache.

460
00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.880
We must have heat.

461
00:36:29.126 --> 00:36:31.356
<i>We've got to keep this bastard burning.</i>

462
00:36:31.461 --> 00:36:34.123
Well, we've got enough
furniture for tonight.


463
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:37.132
Tomorrow we'll go down
that farm and get some logs.


464
00:36:37.234 --> 00:36:41.432
Mistake, I'm telling you.
This was a dreadful mistake.


465
00:38:52.469 --> 00:38:55.029
<i>- Who's there?
- Me.</i>


466
00:38:58.475 --> 00:39:00.375
What do you want?

467
00:39:00.477 --> 00:39:03.708
I'm a friend of Montague
Withnail's. He's lent us his cottage.


468
00:39:03.814 --> 00:39:08.274
I wondered if you could sell
us some food... eggs and things.


469
00:39:08.385 --> 00:39:10.945
Hmm?

470
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.617
What about wood and coal?

471
00:39:16.727 --> 00:39:19.696
I'm not from London, you know.

472
00:39:19.796 --> 00:39:23.061
I don't care where you come from!

473
00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:26.033
<i>Not the attitude I'd
been given to expect...</i>


474
00:39:26.136 --> 00:39:28.366
<i>from the H.E. 
Bates novel I'd read.</i>

475
00:39:28.472 --> 00:39:33.205
<i>I thought they'd all be out the back,
drinking cider, discussing butter.</i>


476
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.210
<i>Clearly a myth.</i>

477
00:39:35.312 --> 00:39:39.408
<i>Evidently, country people are no more
receptive to strangers than city dwellers.</i>


478
00:39:42.486 --> 00:39:46.388
Do you think you could tell me
where I could buy some coal and wood?


479
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.618
<i>You'll have to see me
son. He runs this farm.</i>


480
00:39:49.726 --> 00:39:52.718
<i>- Where is your son?
- Up in top fields.</i>


481
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:56.925
<i>You can't miss him. His
leg's bound in polythene.</i>


482
00:40:21.391 --> 00:40:24.792
Wake up, you bastard! Wake up!

483
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:29.763
Wake up, you bastard!
You gotta get wood.


484
00:40:31.701 --> 00:40:33.931
Jesus! You're covered in shit.

485
00:40:34.037 --> 00:40:35.937
I tried to get the fuel and wood.

486
00:40:36.039 --> 00:40:38.940
There's a miserable little
pensioner down there.


487
00:40:39.042 --> 00:40:41.772
- She wouldn't give it to me.
- Where are we gonna get it, then?


488
00:40:41.878 --> 00:40:44.176
There's a man on the mountain.

489
00:40:44.281 --> 00:40:47.808
Why he's up there fuck knows.

490
00:40:47.918 --> 00:40:50.648
But he's up there with
a leg in polythene.


491
00:40:50.754 --> 00:40:53.154
You can't miss him. 
He's your man.

492
00:40:53.256 --> 00:40:55.952
And have another look in
that shed. Find anything.


493
00:40:56.059 --> 00:40:58.960
If you can't find
anything, bring in the shed.


494
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.528
How come Monty owns such
a horrible little shack?


495
00:41:06.636 --> 00:41:08.570
No idea.

496
00:41:08.672 --> 00:41:11.232
You never discuss your family, do you?

497
00:41:11.341 --> 00:41:14.139
I fail to see my family
as of any interest to you.


498
00:41:14.244 --> 00:41:16.804
I have absolutely no interest in yours.

499
00:41:16.913 --> 00:41:20.542
I dislike relatives in
general, my own in particular.


500
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.983
- Why?
- Because... I've told you why.


501
00:41:24.087 --> 00:41:28.046
We're incompatible. They
don't like me being on stage.


502
00:41:28.158 --> 00:41:30.820
<i>Then they must be
delighted with your career.</i>


503
00:41:30.927 --> 00:41:33.589
- What do you mean?
- You rarely are.


504
00:41:33.697 --> 00:41:35.892
You just wait! 
Just you wait!

505
00:41:35.999 --> 00:41:39.059
When I strike, they
won't know what hit them.


506
00:41:39.169 --> 00:41:41.364
Tractor approaching.

507
00:41:41.471 --> 00:41:44.440
Now get after him. 
That's the man.

508
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.175
- Hey, stop!
- Stop!


509
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.248
Stop! Please!

510
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:55.045
Stop, please! Please stop!

511
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:00.917
Please stop!

512
00:42:01.024 --> 00:42:03.925
<i>- Are you the farmer?
- Shut up! I'll deal with this!</i>


513
00:42:04.027 --> 00:42:06.120
We've gone on holiday by mistake.

514
00:42:06.229 --> 00:42:08.595
We're in this cottage
here. Are you the farmer?


515
00:42:08.698 --> 00:42:11.758
Stop saying that, Withnail! Of
course he's the fucking farmer!


516
00:42:11.868 --> 00:42:14.996
We're friends of Montague Withnail.

517
00:42:15.105 --> 00:42:17.699
We desperately need fuel and wood.

518
00:42:17.807 --> 00:42:21.106
Montague Withnail. 
You must know him!

519
00:42:21.211 --> 00:42:23.372
Fat man, owns the cottage.

520
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.381
I seen a fat man.
London type. Queer sort.


521
00:42:26.483 --> 00:42:28.713
Think his name's French, or summit.

522
00:42:28.818 --> 00:42:31.446
<i>- French?
- Aye. Adriene De La Touche.</i>


523
00:42:31.555 --> 00:42:34.115
He ain't been here
for a couple of years.


524
00:42:34.224 --> 00:42:37.523
- Last time I saw him he was with his son.
- Yeah, that's him.


525
00:42:37.627 --> 00:42:41.825
Listen, we're bona fide. We're not from
London. Could we have some fuel and wood?


526
00:42:41.932 --> 00:42:45.299
I could bring you some logs up later.
I've got the cows to feed first.


527
00:42:45.402 --> 00:42:47.836
- When?
- Shut up! That would be very kind.


528
00:42:47.938 --> 00:42:51.101
What about food? Do you think you
could sell us something to eat?


529
00:42:51.208 --> 00:42:54.177
I could bring you a chicken, but
you'll have to go to the village.


530
00:42:54.277 --> 00:42:56.336
- That would be very kind, Mr...
- Parkin.


531
00:42:56.446 --> 00:42:59.347
Mr. Parkin. What happened to your leg?

532
00:42:59.449 --> 00:43:02.782
Got a randy bull up there.
Give me one in the knee.


533
00:43:16.399 --> 00:43:19.266
You wanna go out back?
Get some spuds up?


534
00:43:19.369 --> 00:43:23.100
Sorry, I can't. My
boots are in the oven.


535
00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:25.936
- You'd go if you had boots?

536
00:43:26.042 --> 00:43:28.033
<i>Gladly.</i>

537
00:43:53.303 --> 00:43:55.794
- I've got one!

538
00:44:21.464 --> 00:44:24.695
- Great. How much do we owe you?
- Pay us when you come down.


539
00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:27.065
- What about this chicken?
- He's on the back.


540
00:44:37.647 --> 00:44:40.582
With. With.

541
00:44:40.684 --> 00:44:43.778
Parkin's been. 
There's our supper.

542
00:44:43.887 --> 00:44:46.685
- What are we supposed to do with that?
- Eat it.


543
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.724
Eat it? The fucker's alive.

544
00:44:48.825 --> 00:44:50.725
- Yeah, I know that. You've gotta kill it.
- Me?


545
00:44:50.827 --> 00:44:54.854
- I'm fire lighter and fuel collector.
- Yeah, I know that, but I got the logs in.


546
00:44:59.369 --> 00:45:02.065
It takes away your
appetite looking at it.


547
00:45:02.172 --> 00:45:04.663
No, it doesn't. I'm starving.

548
00:45:04.774 --> 00:45:07.902
- How can we make it die?
- You have to throttle them.


549
00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:12.641
I think you should strangle it instantly,
in case it starts to make friends with us.


550
00:45:12.749 --> 00:45:16.515
All right, get hold of it. You
hold it down. I'll strangle it.


551
00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:20.680
I can't. Those dreadful,
beady eyes. They stare you out.


552
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:24.658
It's a bloody chicken! Just think
of it with bacon across its back.


553
00:45:24.761 --> 00:45:27.286
All right, I'll deal with this.

554
00:45:27.397 --> 00:45:29.957
You'll have to get its guts out.

555
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.468
Never point guns at people!
It's extremely dangerous.


556
00:45:40.577 --> 00:45:43.410
What about this roasting dish?
What are we gonna cook it in?


557
00:45:43.513 --> 00:45:47.244
You're the food and plumbings man. I have
no idea. I wish I'd found this an hour ago.


558
00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.114
I'd have taken great pleasure
in gunning this pullet down.


559
00:45:53.556 --> 00:45:56.582
- Shouldn't it be more bald than that?
- No, it shouldn't.


560
00:45:56.693 --> 00:46:01.289
Right. We're gonna have
to reverse the roles.


561
00:46:01.398 --> 00:46:05.596
We can bake the potatoes in the oven...

562
00:46:05.702 --> 00:46:08.398
and we can boil this
bastard over the fire.


563
00:46:08.505 --> 00:46:11.269
- Let's get its feet off.
- No.


564
00:46:11.374 --> 00:46:13.865
It's gonna need its feet.

565
00:46:29.058 --> 00:46:31.788
It can stand with its legs
on either side of that.


566
00:46:39.269 --> 00:46:42.534
I've already put two shilling pieces in.

567
00:46:42.639 --> 00:46:45.403
No, I haven't got another.

568
00:46:45.508 --> 00:46:48.807
It's not my fault if
the system doesn't work.


569
00:46:51.214 --> 00:46:53.580
The bitch hung up on me.

570
00:47:07.964 --> 00:47:10.933
<i>Hello? How are you?</i>

571
00:47:11.034 --> 00:47:13.696
Very well.

572
00:47:13.803 --> 00:47:18.172
A what? Why wouldn't they see me?

573
00:47:18.274 --> 00:47:20.640
This is ridiculous.

574
00:47:20.743 --> 00:47:23.439
I haven't been up for
a job in three months!


575
00:47:23.546 --> 00:47:27.038
Understudy Constantine? I'm not
going to understudy Constantine.


576
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.380
Why can't I play the part?

577
00:47:29.486 --> 00:47:31.716
This is ridiculous.

578
00:47:31.821 --> 00:47:34.688
No, I'm not in London. Penrith.

579
00:47:34.791 --> 00:47:36.918
Penrith!

580
00:47:37.026 --> 00:47:39.051
Well, what about TV?

581
00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:43.060
Listen, I pay you ten
percent to do that.


582
00:47:43.166 --> 00:47:46.727
<i>Well, lick ten percent
of the asses for me, then!</i>


583
00:47:46.836 --> 00:47:49.566
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello?</i>

584
00:47:49.672 --> 00:47:54.234
Hello? How dare you? Fuck you!

585
00:47:56.746 --> 00:48:01.547
<i>The bastard asked me to understudy
Constantine in The Seagull.</i>


586
00:48:03.887 --> 00:48:08.017
I don't want to understudy anybody,
especially that little pimp.


587
00:48:09.526 --> 00:48:12.120
Anyway, I loathe those Russian plays.

588
00:48:12.228 --> 00:48:15.129
Always full of women
staring out of windows,


589
00:48:15.231 --> 00:48:17.290
whining about ducks going to Moscow.

590
00:48:28.011 --> 00:48:30.639
What do you think of Desmond Wolfe?

591
00:48:30.747 --> 00:48:33.875
- In respect of what?
- I'm thinking of changing my name.


592
00:48:33.983 --> 00:48:37.146
It's too like Donald Wolfit.

593
00:48:37.253 --> 00:48:39.278
Changeover point.

594
00:48:43.893 --> 00:48:46.453
- Think he's happier than us?
- No.


595
00:48:51.634 --> 00:48:53.761
I suppose happiness is relative.

596
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.600
I never thought it would be a
polythene bag without a hole in it.


597
00:48:56.706 --> 00:48:59.834
- Hey!
- What's the matter with him?


598
00:48:59.943 --> 00:49:03.276
- Shut the gate!
- You didn't shut the gate!


599
00:49:03.379 --> 00:49:05.370
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

600
00:49:07.216 --> 00:49:09.514
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

601
00:49:12.822 --> 00:49:15.882
Grab its ring! 
Keep your bag up!

602
00:49:15.992 --> 00:49:18.358
<i>Out-mind him.</i>

603
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:21.487
Hey, show no fear. 
Just run at it.

604
00:49:21.598 --> 00:49:23.930
That can't be sensible, can it?
The bastard's about to run at me!


605
00:49:24.033 --> 00:49:26.331
- Well, he's randy!
- Yes, I know he is!


606
00:49:26.436 --> 00:49:28.734
Wants to get down there and
have sex with those cows.


607
00:49:28.838 --> 00:49:30.965
Shut up!

608
00:49:31.074 --> 00:49:35.170
- Run at it, shouting!
- Do as he says, start shouting.


609
00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.243
- He won't gore you.
- A coward you are, Withnail!


610
00:49:41.351 --> 00:49:44.582
An expert on bulls you are not!

611
00:49:57.033 --> 00:49:58.933
Shut that gate and keep it shut!

612
00:50:01.838 --> 00:50:04.739
I think an evening at the Crow.

613
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.344
<i>If the Crow and Crown ever
had life, it was dead now.</i>


614
00:50:11.447 --> 00:50:13.972
<i>It was like walking into a lung,</i>

615
00:50:14.083 --> 00:50:18.315
<i>a sulfer-stained, nicotine
yellow and fly-blown lung.</i>


616
00:50:18.421 --> 00:50:22.551
<i>Its landlord was a retired alcoholic
with military pretensions...</i>


617
00:50:22.659 --> 00:50:25.025
<i>and a complexion like
the inside of a teapot.</i>


618
00:50:26.029 --> 00:50:29.294
<i>By the time the doors opened,
he was arse-holed on rum...</i>


619
00:50:29.399 --> 00:50:31.526
<i>and got progressively
more arse-holed...</i>


620
00:50:31.634 --> 00:50:34.899
<i>till he could take no more</i>

621
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.536
We'll have another
pair of large scotches.


622
00:50:58.194 --> 00:51:01.129
Thought I was going for a minute.

623
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:03.221
No man's put me down yet.

624
00:51:03.332 --> 00:51:05.425
Have you had any training
in the martial arts?


625
00:51:05.535 --> 00:51:07.935
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

626
00:51:08.037 --> 00:51:10.904
Before I became a journalist,
I was in the Territorials.


627
00:51:11.007 --> 00:51:13.805
You know, when you first came in,

628
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.879
I knew you were a services man.

629
00:51:16.979 --> 00:51:20.437
You could never, never disguise it.

630
00:51:23.052 --> 00:51:26.283
- What were you in?
- Tanks.


631
00:51:26.389 --> 00:51:29.654
Africa Corps. Little before your time.

632
00:51:29.759 --> 00:51:32.489
I don't suppose you've
engaged, have you?


633
00:51:32.595 --> 00:51:36.759
- Ireland.
- Ooh, crack at the Mick?


634
00:51:36.866 --> 00:51:39.801
We'll have another
pair of large scotches.


635
00:51:39.902 --> 00:51:42.462
These shall be my pleasure.

636
00:51:47.844 --> 00:51:49.812
What are you doing up here, then?

637
00:51:49.912 --> 00:51:51.880
<i>We're doing a feature for Country Life.</i>

638
00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:53.881
Survey of rural types.

639
00:51:53.983 --> 00:51:58.317
You know, farmers, traveling tinkers,

640
00:51:58.421 --> 00:52:00.787
milkmen, that sort of thing.

641
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.790
Have you...

642
00:52:05.294 --> 00:52:07.421
Have you met Jake?

643
00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:10.090
Poacher. Works the lake.

644
00:52:10.199 --> 00:52:13.726
But, uh, keep it under your hat, hmm?

645
00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.673
What's all this army bollocks?

646
00:52:26.783 --> 00:52:29.411
We got a drink, didn't we?

647
00:52:32.155 --> 00:52:34.715
Time, gentlemen.

648
00:52:37.059 --> 00:52:39.050
I think he means it.

649
00:53:10.126 --> 00:53:13.220
- Go ask him if we can have one.
- What for?


650
00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:16.958
So we can eat it.
We're fed up with stew!


651
00:53:23.306 --> 00:53:26.298
Excuse me. Could we have an eel?

652
00:53:26.409 --> 00:53:30.004
- You've got eels down your leg.
- You leave them alone.


653
00:53:30.112 --> 00:53:33.946
Nothing down there of interest to you.

654
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.814
Help us out, Raymond.

655
00:53:36.919 --> 00:53:41.083
These be fed from asshole to beak.

656
00:53:42.925 --> 00:53:46.952
How about one of those
pheasants? Go on, ask him.


657
00:53:48.731 --> 00:53:52.497
Excuse me. We were wondering if we
could purchase a pheasant off of you?


658
00:53:52.602 --> 00:53:54.934
No. I've got nothing to sell.

659
00:53:55.037 --> 00:53:58.006
Come on, old boy. 
What's in your hump?

660
00:53:58.107 --> 00:54:03.010
Now look, you. Them pheasants are for
his pot. These here are for my pot.


661
00:54:03.112 --> 00:54:06.047
<i>Now what makes you think I should
give you something for your pot?</i>


662
00:54:06.148 --> 00:54:08.912
- What pot?
- Our cooking pot.


663
00:54:09.018 --> 00:54:12.715
He knows. Hey, give us
a wheeze on that fag.


664
00:54:16.525 --> 00:54:19.961
I might come and see you lads in a
week. I might fetch you up a rabbit.


665
00:54:20.062 --> 00:54:22.826
We don't want a rabbit.
We want a pheasant.


666
00:54:22.932 --> 00:54:25.958
<i>Listen, you young prat.
I ain't got no pheasants.</i>


667
00:54:26.068 --> 00:54:28.593
I ain't got no birds,
no more than you have.


668
00:54:28.704 --> 00:54:31.832
Of course you have. 
You're the poacher.

669
00:54:31.941 --> 00:54:34.933
If I hear more words out of you,

670
00:54:35.044 --> 00:54:38.275
I'll put one of these
here black pods on you.


671
00:54:38.381 --> 00:54:41.441
- Don't threaten me with a dead fish.
- Half dead, he may be.


672
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:45.213
But I'll come up after you, and
I'll wake you up with a live one.


673
00:54:45.321 --> 00:54:49.280
Sod your pheasants! You'll
have to find us first.


674
00:54:49.392 --> 00:54:52.225
<i>I know where you are, at Crow Crag.</i>

675
00:54:52.328 --> 00:54:54.421
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

676
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.294
Especially you, prancing like a tit.

677
00:54:59.068 --> 00:55:01.866
You want working on, boy.

678
00:55:01.971 --> 00:55:05.771
If I see that silage heap
hanging about up here,


679
00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:09.106
I'll take the bastard axe to him!

680
00:55:09.211 --> 00:55:13.113
Bastards! You'll all suffer!

681
00:55:13.215 --> 00:55:15.683
I'll show the lot of you!

682
00:55:15.785 --> 00:55:19.221
I'm gonna be a star!

683
00:55:23.025 --> 00:55:25.118
Vegetables again.

684
00:55:25.194 --> 00:55:27.856
I'll be sprouting bloody feelers soon.

685
00:55:27.964 --> 00:55:30.831
Must be 20,000 sheep out
there on those volcanoes,


686
00:55:30.933 --> 00:55:33.527
and we got a plate full of carrots.

687
00:55:33.636 --> 00:55:37.003
- There's black puddings in it.
- Black puddings are no good to us.


688
00:55:37.106 --> 00:55:39.904
I want something's flesh!

689
00:55:51.487 --> 00:55:54.251
Look! Come here! Down here. Look.

690
00:55:54.357 --> 00:55:57.087
Under the rock. I can see it.

691
00:55:58.327 --> 00:56:01.023
See him? Look.

692
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.360
He's over there. Look. Here.

693
00:56:03.466 --> 00:56:06.299
There's two of them here.
Look. Come on, come on.


694
00:56:06.402 --> 00:56:08.563
Where?

695
00:56:31.694 --> 00:56:34.891
I think I'll call myself Donald Twain.

696
00:56:35.998 --> 00:56:40.128
Stop. Get down.

697
00:56:41.704 --> 00:56:44.172
It's him. What does he want?

698
00:56:44.273 --> 00:56:47.640
- Go down there and ask him.
- Don't be a fool. He's got a gun.


699
00:56:47.743 --> 00:56:50.405
Bastard's psychotic. You've
only got to look at him.


700
00:57:00.723 --> 00:57:03.954
This place has become impossible.

701
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.518
Perpetual rain, freezing cold.

702
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:10.394
Now a bloody madman on the
prowl outside with eels.


703
00:57:10.499 --> 00:57:13.263
All right, you made your point.

704
00:57:13.369 --> 00:57:16.532
We pack up. We get out tomorrow.

705
00:57:16.639 --> 00:57:18.732
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for a slash.


706
00:57:18.841 --> 00:57:21.435
No, you're not. I can't get
my boots on when they're hot.


707
00:57:21.544 --> 00:57:24.274
- I'll go alone.
- You're not leaving me in here alone.


708
00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:27.941
<i>- Those are the kind of windows faces look in at.
- Then I won't have a slash.</i>


709
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.280
And in both our interests, I think
we should sleep together tonight.


710
00:57:30.386 --> 00:57:33.446
Don't be ridiculous. He's not
gonna come up here in the dark.


711
00:57:33.556 --> 00:57:35.956
Of course he is. If
he catches one of us,


712
00:57:36.058 --> 00:57:38.788
he's got a better chance
of dealing with the other.


713
00:57:38.894 --> 00:57:41.488
<i>No.</i>

714
00:57:54.543 --> 00:57:57.910
What's the matter with you?
What are you laughing at?


715
00:57:58.013 --> 00:58:00.379
I was dreaming. 
What do you want?

716
00:58:00.483 --> 00:58:03.941
You frightened the piss out of
me. Move over. I'm getting in.


717
00:58:08.491 --> 00:58:11.983
Oh, this is ridiculous. I'll
have to sleep in your bed.


718
00:58:12.094 --> 00:58:14.494
- I'll have to come with you.
- Will you get out?


719
00:58:14.597 --> 00:58:17.361
- No.
- All right, then I will.


720
00:58:25.808 --> 00:58:28.709
All right, you can stay,
but the gun doesn't.


721
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:31.507
No. I have to keep the gun.
I intend to remain awake.


722
00:58:31.614 --> 00:58:34.208
- This is my bed, and I demand precedence.
- No!


723
00:58:39.955 --> 00:58:43.186
Mad fucking bastard!

724
00:59:05.848 --> 00:59:08.817
Shhh! Shhh!

725
00:59:08.918 --> 00:59:12.046
- Listen.
- There is nothing! Get to bed!


726
00:59:12.154 --> 00:59:14.554
I heard a noise.

727
00:59:14.657 --> 00:59:16.557
I must get in.

728
00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.818
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake.</i>

729
00:59:21.931 --> 00:59:24.126
- What was that?
- That's it. That's it.


730
00:59:24.233 --> 00:59:26.827
- What is it?
- It's the killer.


731
00:59:26.936 --> 00:59:30.895
<i>- It's probably foxes looking for grub.
- Listen. Listen.</i>


732
00:59:31.006 --> 00:59:33.736
Maybe it's the farmer.

733
00:59:33.842 --> 00:59:37.676
At 2:00 in the morning? 
It's the killer.

734
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:41.272
He's come to kill us.
What are we gonna do?


735
00:59:43.852 --> 00:59:46.787
He wants to come in.
He's trying to get in.


736
00:59:46.889 --> 00:59:49.881
He can't. He'll go away.

737
00:59:49.992 --> 00:59:52.085
He's going away.

738
00:59:57.466 --> 00:59:59.593
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

739
00:59:59.702 --> 01:00:02.671
You've even given him the fucking gun.

740
01:00:07.576 --> 01:00:10.773
He's coming through the
window. He's getting in.


741
01:00:10.879 --> 01:00:14.042
- Give me the matches.
- Downstairs.


742
01:00:15.718 --> 01:00:20.280
He's in. He's sharpening
a fucking knife.


743
01:00:22.491 --> 01:00:25.892
We'll have to tackle him. You stay
in bed, pretending to be asleep.


744
01:00:25.995 --> 01:00:28.896
He'll go for you. When he
does, I'll jump on his back.


745
01:00:28.998 --> 01:00:31.933
No, no, no. It'll be too
late. I'll be knifed by then.


746
01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:34.867
We'll have to try and
make friends with him.


747
01:00:40.909 --> 01:00:44.276
They're going into your
room. It's you he wants.


748
01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.543
Offer him yourself.

749
01:00:58.294 --> 01:01:01.627
We mean no harm!

750
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:06.064
<i>Oh, my boys! My boys! 
Forgive me!</i>

751
01:01:06.168 --> 01:01:10.264
- Monty! Monty, Monty!
- Monty, you terrible cunt!


752
01:01:10.372 --> 01:01:13.603
<i>Forgive me. It was inconsiderate
of me not to have telegrammed.</i>


753
01:01:13.709 --> 01:01:16.701
What are you doing, prowling around
in the middle of the fucking night!


754
01:01:16.812 --> 01:01:20.748
I had a punctured tire. I had
to wait an eon for assistance.


755
01:01:20.849 --> 01:01:24.148
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I should have knocked, but...


756
01:01:24.253 --> 01:01:28.246
<i>- I- I-I'll sleep in the other
room, if I may. - Anywhere you like.</i>


757
01:01:28.357 --> 01:01:31.849
Uh, yes, well. 
Uh... good night.

758
01:01:36.031 --> 01:01:39.194
Brrr! Ah, good morning.
Did you sleep well?


759
01:01:39.301 --> 01:01:41.201
Mm-hmm.

760
01:01:45.774 --> 01:01:49.141
Um, I-I-I do apologize
for last night.


761
01:01:49.244 --> 01:01:53.146
- It was perfectly inconsiderate of me.
- It's perfectly all right, Monty.


762
01:01:53.248 --> 01:01:56.081
- You've been busy in here?
- As a bee.


763
01:01:56.185 --> 01:02:00.121
- How did you repair the window?
- Oh, I didn't break it.


764
01:02:00.222 --> 01:02:04.886
Merely forced it a little.
Sorry if I frightened you.


765
01:02:04.993 --> 01:02:08.087
There was an empty wine
bottle on the ledge.


766
01:02:08.197 --> 01:02:11.325
Oh, tomatoes. Yes.

767
01:02:16.972 --> 01:02:20.430
<i>Why don't you go and wake
him? Breakfast in 15 minutes.</i>


768
01:02:20.542 --> 01:02:24.876
The old order changeth,

769
01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.472
yielding place to new.

770
01:02:28.584 --> 01:02:33.317
And God fulfills Himself in many ways.

771
01:02:33.422 --> 01:02:35.890
And soon...

772
01:02:36.992 --> 01:02:39.290
I suppose...

773
01:02:39.395 --> 01:02:41.488
I shall be swept away...

774
01:02:41.597 --> 01:02:44.896
by some vulgar little tumor.

775
01:02:46.368 --> 01:02:48.802
Oh, my boys.

776
01:02:48.904 --> 01:02:52.362
My boys, we're at
the end of an age.

777
01:02:52.474 --> 01:02:55.773
We live in a land of
weather forecasts...


778
01:02:55.878 --> 01:02:58.779
and breakfasts that 'set in,'

779
01:02:58.881 --> 01:03:02.817
shat on by Tories, shoveled up by Labor.

780
01:03:02.918 --> 01:03:06.718
And here we are... we three...

781
01:03:06.822 --> 01:03:11.225
perhaps the last island
of beauty in the world.


782
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:18.197
Now, which of you is going
to be a splendid fellow...


783
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.292
and go down to the Rolls
for the rest of the wine?


784
01:03:21.403 --> 01:03:24.668
- I will.
- No, I'd better go. I wanna dig the car out anyway.


785
01:03:24.773 --> 01:03:28.539
- But we have my car, dear boy.
- Yes, but if it rains, we're buggered.


786
01:03:28.644 --> 01:03:30.976
- I mean...
- Stranded!


787
01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:34.571
- We'll leave the car till later. Leave this to me.
- I'll come. I fancy a walk.


788
01:03:34.683 --> 01:03:38.517
No, I hear you're a little wizard in the
kitchen. I shall need you, to work the joint.


789
01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:43.489
<i>- Yeah, you're the cook.
- And... what on earth are those?</i>


790
01:03:43.592 --> 01:03:45.924
- We forgot to bring our Wellingtons.
- Oh, but how dreadful.


791
01:03:46.028 --> 01:03:49.259
Do you mean you've been up here in all this
beastly mud and oomska without Wellingtons?


792
01:03:49.364 --> 01:03:52.162
Well, this afternoon I shall
take you both into Penrith...


793
01:03:52.267 --> 01:03:55.896
and get you fitted with some
good quality rubber boots.


794
01:03:59.508 --> 01:04:03.000
Garlic, rosemary and salt.

795
01:04:04.746 --> 01:04:07.738
I brought two of these in case either
of you was any good in the kitchen.


796
01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:11.115
- I'm not.
- Of course you are. Cooking is one of the natural instincts.


797
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.951
Listen, Monty. This is
all very kind of you,


798
01:04:15.057 --> 01:04:17.525
but I really think I ought to be out
there getting work done on the car.


799
01:04:17.626 --> 01:04:20.220
You haven't time. We're
taking late luncheon at 3:00.


800
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:23.389
- I'm afraid we have to leave by 3:00, Monty.
- Leave?


801
01:04:23.499 --> 01:04:26.366
Oh, didn't he tell you? We
have to get back to sign on.


802
01:04:26.468 --> 01:04:31.963
- Sign on? At the Labor Exchange?
- Yeah.


803
01:04:32.074 --> 01:04:36.443
It's sort of fashionable, actually.
All the actors do it. Even Redgrave.


804
01:04:38.113 --> 01:04:42.482
But surely you could forego
for just this one occasion.


805
01:04:42.584 --> 01:04:45.417
I've come a very long
way to see you both.


806
01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:50.458
<i>Can't, actually. I mean, I'd love to stay,
but he's more adamant to get back than I am.</i>


807
01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:53.687
Then we must choose our moment...

808
01:04:55.931 --> 01:04:59.196
and have a word with him.

809
01:05:01.803 --> 01:05:04.567
I'm sure together we could persuade him.

810
01:05:07.142 --> 01:05:10.634
There. Now, garlic,

811
01:05:10.746 --> 01:05:13.408
rosemary and salt.

812
01:05:13.515 --> 01:05:16.712
I can never touch
meat until it's cooked.


813
01:05:16.818 --> 01:05:20.083
As a youth, I used to
weep in butcher shops.


814
01:05:20.188 --> 01:05:23.351
<i>- I can't find the rosemary.
- Ah.</i>


815
01:05:25.427 --> 01:05:28.294
Can't find the rosemary.

816
01:05:29.965 --> 01:05:31.933
I'm sure we could find it together.

817
01:05:34.836 --> 01:05:37.930
- Perhaps it's in the other bag.
- Perhaps it is.


818
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.940
Shall we look?

819
01:05:43.779 --> 01:05:46.304
Oh, sorry. Sherry's in there.

820
01:05:51.787 --> 01:05:54.847
What do you mean, "sorry"? What's
going on? What's he doing here?


821
01:05:54.957 --> 01:05:57.221
We can't stay. 
He won't leave me alone.

822
01:05:57.326 --> 01:05:59.726
<i>All right. We'll get the lunch
done, and then we'll leave.</i>


823
01:06:01.463 --> 01:06:05.024
I'm afraid we must drink from these.

824
01:06:10.105 --> 01:06:13.370
I trust their shapes will
not offend your palates.


825
01:06:13.475 --> 01:06:17.878
- Chin-chin. - To a delightful
weekend in the country.


826
01:06:42.404 --> 01:06:44.736
I do think you could have shaved.

827
01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.934
What on earth will people think
of me turning up with you two?


828
01:06:48.043 --> 01:06:50.341
You look like a pair of farm hands.

829
01:06:56.418 --> 01:06:58.318
Tsk!

830
01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.320
This is most embarrassing.

831
01:07:02.557 --> 01:07:05.025
Get away from the car.

832
01:07:05.127 --> 01:07:08.028
Buy the Wellingtons.

833
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:11.531
I'm going to buy some
razors and shaving soap.


834
01:07:11.633 --> 01:07:14.397
I'll see you over
there in half an hour.

835
01:07:14.503 --> 01:07:17.404
- Pair of blues.
- One each.


836
01:07:18.907 --> 01:07:21.375
- I think a drink, don't you?
- What about the Wellingtons?


837
01:07:21.476 --> 01:07:23.376
Oh, bollocks to the Wellingtons.

838
01:07:23.478 --> 01:07:26.379
We'll tell them they had a farmer's
conference and had a run on them.


839
01:07:35.857 --> 01:07:38.951
Okay. Yeah. Promise.

840
01:07:39.061 --> 01:07:41.427
Bye.

841
01:07:44.733 --> 01:07:49.693
No, hasn't heard a thing. Apparently,
they're still seeing people.


842
01:07:49.805 --> 01:07:52.797
You don't want to go to Manchester
anyway. Play a bloody soldier?


843
01:07:52.908 --> 01:07:55.240
Don't I? I damned well do.

844
01:07:55.343 --> 01:07:58.039
- It's a bloody good little theater.
- It's not much of a part, is it?


845
01:07:58.146 --> 01:08:00.114
Well, it's better than nothing.

846
01:08:00.215 --> 01:08:03.616
- They'll make you cut your hair.
- So what? You'd lose a leg.


847
01:08:03.719 --> 01:08:06.688
- Time gents, please.
- All right. We're gonna have to work quickly.


848
01:08:06.788 --> 01:08:10.451
A pair of quadruple whiskies and
another pair of pints, please.


849
01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:18.121
Where is he? I'm utterly assholed.

850
01:08:18.233 --> 01:08:20.133
We're early.

851
01:08:22.137 --> 01:08:24.935
We want to get in there, don't we?

852
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.873
Eat some cake, soak up the booze.

853
01:08:39.154 --> 01:08:41.452
- All right here?
- What do you want?


854
01:08:41.556 --> 01:08:45.686
- Cake. All right here?
- Uh, no. We're closing in a minute.


855
01:08:45.794 --> 01:08:48.194
We're leaving in a minute.

856
01:08:53.335 --> 01:08:57.533
- We want cake and tea.
- Didn't you hear?


857
01:08:57.639 --> 01:09:00.904
She said she'd closed.
What do you want in here?


858
01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:04.536
Cake. What's it got to do with you?

859
01:09:04.646 --> 01:09:07.342
I happen to be the proprietor.

860
01:09:07.449 --> 01:09:09.883
Now, would you leave?

861
01:09:09.985 --> 01:09:13.182
Ah, I'm glad you're the proprietor.

862
01:09:13.288 --> 01:09:16.223
I was gonna have to have
a word with you anyway.


863
01:09:16.324 --> 01:09:18.758
We're working on a film up here.

864
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.385
Location, see.

865
01:09:21.496 --> 01:09:24.158
We might want to
do a film in here.

866
01:09:24.266 --> 01:09:28.896
- You're drunk.
- Just bring out the cakes. Cake and fine wine.


867
01:09:29.004 --> 01:09:32.337
- If you don't leave, we'll call the police.
- Balls!


868
01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.068
We want the finest wines
available to humanity.


869
01:09:35.177 --> 01:09:37.543
And we want them here,
and we want them now.


870
01:09:37.646 --> 01:09:40.012
<i>Miss Blenehassitt, telephone the police.</i>

871
01:09:40.115 --> 01:09:44.518
It's all right, 
Miss Blenehassitt.

872
01:09:44.619 --> 01:09:48.817
<i>I'm warning you, if
you do, you're fired.</i>


873
01:09:48.924 --> 01:09:51.415
We're multimillionaires.

874
01:09:51.526 --> 01:09:53.858
We shall buy this place
and fire you immediately.


875
01:09:53.962 --> 01:09:58.899
Yes, we'll buy this place, and we'll
install a fucking jukebox in here...


876
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.527
and liven all of
you stiffs up a bit.

877
01:10:02.637 --> 01:10:05.003
The police, Miss Blenehassitt.

878
01:10:05.106 --> 01:10:09.065
Just say there are a couple of drunks in the
Penrith Tea Rooms, and we want them removed.


879
01:10:09.177 --> 01:10:12.544
We are not drunks. We
are multimillionaires.


880
01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:16.048
Hurry up, Mabs. We'll keep
them here till they arrive.


881
01:10:16.151 --> 01:10:18.312
<i>You won't keep us anywhere.</i>

882
01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.547
We'll buy this place
and have it knocked down.


883
01:10:20.655 --> 01:10:22.953
<i>- Right, right, right.
- Police, please.</i>


884
01:10:23.058 --> 01:10:25.686
Right. We're going.

885
01:10:25.794 --> 01:10:28.786
Our car has arrived.

886
01:10:28.897 --> 01:10:31.422
We'll be back.

887
01:10:31.533 --> 01:10:35.526
<i>We're coming back in here.</i>

888
01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:43.204
- Where is he?
- Sulking up the hill.


889
01:10:43.311 --> 01:10:45.677
He says he won't come in
for lunch without an apology.


890
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.180
Suits me. He can eat his fucking radish.

891
01:10:49.951 --> 01:10:51.851
It's all your fault.

892
01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:55.855
- You lead him astray.
- I beg your pardon, Monty.


893
01:10:55.957 --> 01:11:00.087
Don't tell me you're not aware of it.
I know what you're up to, and so do you.


894
01:11:00.195 --> 01:11:03.687
- Sherry?
- Sherry? Oh, dear, no, no, no.


895
01:11:03.798 --> 01:11:08.360
I'd be sucked into his trap. One
of us has got to stay on guard.


896
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:11.633
He's so mauve. We don't
know what he's planning.


897
01:11:22.183 --> 01:11:25.414
I'm preparing myself to forgive you.

898
01:11:27.389 --> 01:11:30.324
I think you've been punished enough.

899
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.427
I think we'd better release
you from the legumes...


900
01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:38.021
and transfer your talents to the meat.

901
01:11:45.507 --> 01:11:48.340
You shouldn't treat each other so badly.

902
01:11:48.443 --> 01:11:51.537
This boy's been out there
frozen to the marrow,


903
01:11:51.646 --> 01:11:54.046
and you just sit in here drinking.

904
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:58.279
Come along. He's going to revitalize himself,
and you're going to finish the vegetables.


905
01:11:58.386 --> 01:12:00.820
- I don't know how to do them.
- Well, of course you don't.


906
01:12:00.922 --> 01:12:03.322
You are incapable of indulging
in anything but pleasure.


907
01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:06.360
Am I not right? You don't
deserve such loyalty.


908
01:12:06.461 --> 01:12:11.091
Now, come along. I'm going to
teach you how to peel a potato.


909
01:12:16.438 --> 01:12:19.669
Isn't it stimulating, getting back
to a basic sort of life for a while?


910
01:12:19.774 --> 01:12:22.538
- Yes.
- Surrounded by trees and nature,


911
01:12:22.644 --> 01:12:25.636
one feels a glorious
stirring of the senses...


912
01:12:25.747 --> 01:12:28.045
a rejection of poisonous inhibition...

913
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:30.640
and a fecund motion of the soul.

914
01:12:30.752 --> 01:12:35.815
Except, of course, the problems tend
to take the edge off the pleasure.


915
01:12:35.924 --> 01:12:40.418
I mean, with no proper facilities.

916
01:12:40.528 --> 01:12:44.225
All the glorious trials
of youth, dear boy.


917
01:12:44.332 --> 01:12:49.998
When I was a lad, I'd rocket off on my tandem
with Wrigglesworth, and we'd just ride and ride.


918
01:12:50.105 --> 01:12:54.872
And at night we'd find
some barn and fall asleep,


919
01:12:54.976 --> 01:12:58.537
with the perfumes of
nature sighing on our skin.


920
01:12:58.646 --> 01:13:02.173
Would it be in bad form
to plagiarize a toast?


921
01:13:02.283 --> 01:13:05.116
It depends entirely on
the quality of the wine.


922
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.485
In this instance, it
most certainly would not.


923
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:13.152
In that case, to a delightful
weekend in the country.


924
01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:15.161
<i>Oh, splendid!</i>

925
01:13:19.034 --> 01:13:21.832
We expected a volley of
argument concerning Mr. Redgrave.


926
01:13:21.936 --> 01:13:25.599
- We're forgetting about Jake...
- Not another word.


927
01:13:25.707 --> 01:13:27.902
Not another word. 
Jake can wait too.

928
01:13:28.009 --> 01:13:31.467
Jake isn't a friend, Monty. I'd
hoped to avoid telling you this,


929
01:13:31.579 --> 01:13:34.343
but there's a psychotic on
the prowl outside this house.


930
01:13:34.449 --> 01:13:38.283
Ask him if I exaggerate. He's
threatened us, and he's dangerous.


931
01:13:38.386 --> 01:13:40.411
Is this true?

932
01:13:40.522 --> 01:13:43.582
Well, there's this
local type hanging about.


933
01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:48.151
A poacher. We got into a tiff, and
he threatened me with a dead fish.


934
01:13:48.263 --> 01:13:51.027
Yes, it was rather amusing, actually.

935
01:13:51.132 --> 01:13:54.329
<i>When you came in,
we thought it was him.</i>

936
01:13:54.436 --> 01:13:58.532
And we thought that you
cleaning your boots...


937
01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.540
was him sharpening his knife.

938
01:14:03.344 --> 01:14:06.472
Oh, how delicious.

939
01:14:06.581 --> 01:14:10.108
Mmm, more meat?

940
01:14:10.218 --> 01:14:12.686
No, thank you. 
I'll go out for a walk.

941
01:14:12.787 --> 01:14:16.814
Oh, wait for us to finish,
dear boy. We'll all go.


942
01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:23.356
Listen, I know what you're
thinking, but I had no alternative.


943
01:14:23.465 --> 01:14:26.229
The old bugger's come a long way, and
I didn't want to put the wind up him.


944
01:14:26.334 --> 01:14:28.495
Your sensitivity overwhelms me.

945
01:14:28.603 --> 01:14:32.130
If you think you're gonna have a
weekend's indulgence at his expense,


946
01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.800
which means him having a
weekend's indulgence at my expense,


947
01:14:34.909 --> 01:14:37.139
- you've got another thing coming.
- I give you my word.


948
01:14:37.245 --> 01:14:40.009
- We'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow? What about tonight?


949
01:14:40.115 --> 01:14:42.515
- He's not gonna try anything.
- Of course he is!


950
01:14:42.617 --> 01:14:46.451
- He means business.
- Anyway, he sent me out to tell you coffee's ready.


951
01:14:46.554 --> 01:14:49.955
I couldn't drink it. I've got a
cramp in the mouth from grinning.


952
01:14:50.058 --> 01:14:52.526
- Well, stop smiling at him.
- I can't help it.


953
01:14:52.627 --> 01:14:55.721
I'm so uptight with
him, I can't stop myself.


954
01:14:57.899 --> 01:15:01.699
<i>"Laisse-moir respirir,</i>

955
01:15:01.769 --> 01:15:06.672
<i>longtemps longtemps L
'odeur de tes cheveux. "</i>


956
01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:09.937
Ah, Baudelaire.

957
01:15:10.044 --> 01:15:13.707
Brings back such memories of Oxford!

958
01:15:13.815 --> 01:15:15.806
Oh, Oxford!

959
01:15:15.917 --> 01:15:19.444
<i>Followed by yet another anecdote
about his sensitive crimes...</i>


960
01:15:19.554 --> 01:15:21.715
<i>in a punt with a chap called Norman...</i>

961
01:15:21.823 --> 01:15:23.723
<i>who had red hair
and a book of poetry...</i>

962
01:15:23.825 --> 01:15:25.952
<i>stained with the butter
drips from crumpets.</i>


963
01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:29.154
I often wonder where Norman is now.

964
01:15:29.264 --> 01:15:31.562
Probably wintering with
his mother in Guildford.


965
01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:33.566
A cat and rain.

966
01:15:33.668 --> 01:15:35.568
Vim under the sink.

967
01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:38.696
And both bars on.

968
01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:41.707
But old now... old.

969
01:15:41.809 --> 01:15:44.471
There can be no true
beauty without decay.


970
01:15:44.579 --> 01:15:50.074
"A requiem for England. "
- How right you are. How right you are.


971
01:15:50.185 --> 01:15:53.677
We live in a kingdom of rains...

972
01:15:53.788 --> 01:15:57.588
where royalty comes in gangs.

973
01:15:57.692 --> 01:16:01.025
Come on, lads. Let's get home.
The sky is beginning to bruise.


974
01:16:01.129 --> 01:16:04.656
Night must fall, and we
shall be forced to camp.


975
01:16:06.301 --> 01:16:08.861
He's not in my room, all right?
That's the condition, all right?


976
01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:11.438
- All right.
- I want the room with the lock. Agree to that, or I'm off.


977
01:16:11.539 --> 01:16:13.439
All right. All right.

978
01:16:20.848 --> 01:16:24.784
<i>Good ol'Jake, eh? I told you. 
He's back.</i>

979
01:16:24.886 --> 01:16:27.787
And that's precisely the
reason I'm off to London.


980
01:16:27.889 --> 01:16:30.585
Let's all have a good
laugh, eh, Withnail?


981
01:16:30.692 --> 01:16:33.786
Good ol'Jake is back.

982
01:16:33.895 --> 01:16:36.329
He's going away. He's leaving.

983
01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:39.628
Come on. Let's pack up and get
out of here before it gets dark.


984
01:16:57.118 --> 01:17:00.849
"Here hare, here. "

985
01:17:01.956 --> 01:17:04.220
"Here hare, here. "

986
01:17:04.325 --> 01:17:06.225
Good ol'Jake.

987
01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:20.530
<i>Ace bets. Ace bets two
and it's over to you.</i>


988
01:17:20.608 --> 01:17:24.305
Your two and up two.

989
01:17:24.412 --> 01:17:26.312
<i>- Mmm.
- So that's four?</i>


990
01:17:26.414 --> 01:17:28.609
That's four.

991
01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:36.114
<i>- Four.
- This is for the raise. We'll see the two.</i>


992
01:17:36.224 --> 01:17:39.159
Now, last card up.

993
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.285
"Looking a bit lonely, isn't he?"

994
01:17:41.396 --> 01:17:44.422
" He needs a queen to
come to the rescue. "


995
01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:49.631
And... oh!

996
01:17:52.607 --> 01:17:55.167
There she is.

997
01:17:55.276 --> 01:17:58.712
Oh!

998
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:06.078
Well, it's the two queens to beat.

999
01:18:20.101 --> 01:18:22.296
Another hand?

1000
01:18:26.174 --> 01:18:29.143
I think we'd better get him to bed.

1001
01:18:29.243 --> 01:18:31.677
No, no. He's down here.

1002
01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:36.278
You're in my room, I'm in
his room and he's down here.


1003
01:18:36.384 --> 01:18:40.480
I wouldn't dream of depriving the dear fellow
of his bed, especially in that condition.


1004
01:18:40.588 --> 01:18:43.284
- But it's agreed. It's what he wants.
- No, I don't.


1005
01:18:43.391 --> 01:18:45.291
I wanna get to bed.

1006
01:18:46.861 --> 01:18:49.830
All right then, lovey.
Let's get you to bed.


1007
01:18:49.931 --> 01:18:52.365
Early night will do us both good.

1008
01:18:54.502 --> 01:18:58.598
<i>- Night-night, then,
Monty. - I want to be alone!</i>


1009
01:19:01.376 --> 01:19:03.276
I wanna be alone.

1010
01:19:25.733 --> 01:19:28.293
I think he'd better sleep alone tonight.

1011
01:19:30.438 --> 01:19:34.875
- He doesn't want to sleep with you.
- Right.


1012
01:19:34.976 --> 01:19:38.468
Well, you're in there,

1013
01:19:38.579 --> 01:19:41.047
and I'll take these
and I'll have the couch.


1014
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:44.984
I'll say good night, then, Monty.

1015
01:19:45.086 --> 01:19:49.318
You already have... twice.

1016
01:20:17.919 --> 01:20:21.480
What is it, Monty? I'm terribly
tired. I need to go to sleep.


1017
01:20:21.589 --> 01:20:25.025
<i>But not that tired, eh?</i>

1018
01:20:30.164 --> 01:20:35.158
- Are you a sponge or a stone?
- What do you mean?


1019
01:20:35.269 --> 01:20:38.761
<i>Do you like to experience
all facets of life?</i>


1020
01:20:38.873 --> 01:20:42.365
Or do you shut yourself
off from new experience?


1021
01:20:42.477 --> 01:20:44.741
<i>- I voted Conservative.
- Are you faithful?</i>


1022
01:20:44.846 --> 01:20:48.282
- To whom?
- Faithfulness isn't selective.


1023
01:20:48.382 --> 01:20:52.318
<i>I agree. It's more a question of
selecting to whom one will be faithful.</i>


1024
01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:56.618
- Have you selected?
- I'm terribly tired.


1025
01:20:56.724 --> 01:21:00.660
I've been watching you all evening.

1026
01:21:00.761 --> 01:21:03.924
You've been avoiding
my eyes, haven't you?


1027
01:21:04.031 --> 01:21:06.431
- Your eyes?
- Mmm.


1028
01:21:06.534 --> 01:21:09.901
At luncheon, you couldn't
tear your gaze from mine.


1029
01:21:10.004 --> 01:21:12.564
This evening, you barely looked at me.

1030
01:21:12.673 --> 01:21:14.834
What did he say to you?

1031
01:21:14.942 --> 01:21:17.809
<i>- Nothing.
- You can tell me.</i>


1032
01:21:17.912 --> 01:21:20.540
I assure you, nothing, M
-Monty.

1033
01:21:20.648 --> 01:21:24.550
I'm terribly tired. 
I need to go to bed.

1034
01:21:24.652 --> 01:21:27.587
<i>Yes, you must, mustn't you?</i>

1035
01:21:27.688 --> 01:21:30.316
Off you go, then.

1036
01:21:30.424 --> 01:21:32.517
I'll sleep here.

1037
01:21:32.627 --> 01:21:36.654
It won't be the first time
I've been left with the couch.


1038
01:21:53.574 --> 01:21:56.065
Boy.

1039
01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:00.777
Boy.

1040
01:22:00.881 --> 01:22:04.908
I know you're not asleep, boy.

1041
01:22:05.019 --> 01:22:08.853
<i>But he is.</i>

1042
01:22:08.956 --> 01:22:12.551
I've been into his room.

1043
01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:15.458
He won't hear a thing.

1044
01:22:18.432 --> 01:22:20.332
I know you're not asleep, boy.

1045
01:22:20.434 --> 01:22:23.597
No, I'm not. What is it, Monty?

1046
01:22:23.704 --> 01:22:27.663
What do you want?

1047
01:22:27.775 --> 01:22:31.609
I had to come. 
I tried not to.

1048
01:22:31.712 --> 01:22:34.340
Oh, how I tried not to.

1049
01:22:34.448 --> 01:22:36.746
Monty, there's something
I have to explain to you.


1050
01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:39.251
You needn't explain.
He's told me everything.


1051
01:22:39.353 --> 01:22:41.253
He told me that first
day you came to Chelsea.


1052
01:22:41.355 --> 01:22:45.883
- What's he told you?
- He told me about your arrest in the Tottenham Court Road.


1053
01:22:45.993 --> 01:22:48.461
He told me about your problems,

1054
01:22:48.562 --> 01:22:51.292
how you feel, your desires.

1055
01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:55.130
- Problems? What problems?
- You are a toilet trader.


1056
01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:57.864
- He told you that?
- You mustn't blame him.


1057
01:22:57.972 --> 01:23:02.136
You mustn't blame yourself. I know
how you feel and how difficult it is.


1058
01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:07.510
And that's why you mustn't hold back, let
it ruin your youth as I nearly did over Eric.


1059
01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:10.675
It's like a tide. 
Give in to it, boy.

1060
01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:15.188
Go with it. It's
society's crime, not ours.


1061
01:23:15.289 --> 01:23:18.417
- I'm not homosexual, Monty.
- Yes, you are!


1062
01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:22.257
Of course you are. You're simply
blackmailing your emotions...


1063
01:23:22.363 --> 01:23:25.025
to avoid the realities of
your relationship with him.


1064
01:23:25.132 --> 01:23:28.260
- What are you talking about?
- You love him.


1065
01:23:28.369 --> 01:23:30.769
And it isn't his fault
he cannot love you...


1066
01:23:30.871 --> 01:23:33.897
any more than it's
mine that I adore you.


1067
01:23:37.678 --> 01:23:40.841
Couldn't we allow ourselves just
this one moment of indiscretion?


1068
01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:42.848
- No!
- He need never know.


1069
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:46.044
I don't care what he knows! Monty,
you've gotta go! You've gotta leave!


1070
01:23:46.153 --> 01:23:48.678
If you want to humiliate
me, humiliate me.


1071
01:23:48.789 --> 01:23:50.723
I adore you.

1072
01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.521
Tell him, if you must. 
I no longer care.

1073
01:23:53.627 --> 01:23:57.586
I mean to have you, even
if it must be burglary!


1074
01:23:59.433 --> 01:24:01.333
It's not me, it's him!

1075
01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:09.900
He lied to you. 
We're an affair.

1076
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:12.740
We have been for years, but
he doesn't want you to know.


1077
01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:16.749
He doesn't want anybody to know. We're
both in it. We're obsessed with each other.


1078
01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:20.480
But he's ashamed. He refuses to
come out and accept what he is.


1079
01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:23.386
That's why he's rejecting
me while you're here.


1080
01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:28.258
On my life, Monty, this is the first night
we haven't slept together for six years.


1081
01:24:28.362 --> 01:24:30.387
I can't cheat on him. 
It would kill him.

1082
01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:33.934
But he told me you were in purgatory
because he couldn't love you.


1083
01:24:34.034 --> 01:24:37.026
<i>He's lying. Lying!</i>

1084
01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:41.404
Oh, my dear boy.

1085
01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:44.637
If I had known that, I would never
have attempted to come between you.


1086
01:24:44.745 --> 01:24:47.179
I know that, Monty.

1087
01:24:47.281 --> 01:24:49.749
I respect you for your sensitivity.

1088
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:52.114
I thank you for it,

1089
01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:54.483
but you must leave.

1090
01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:59.852
Yes.

1091
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.327
Yes. You'd better go to him.

1092
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:05.626
Oh, I intend to.

1093
01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:07.860
This instant.

1094
01:25:08.302 --> 01:25:11.635
<i>Withnail, you bastard. Wake up.</i>

1095
01:25:11.705 --> 01:25:16.733
Wake up, you bastard, or I'll
burn this bastard bed down.


1096
01:25:16.844 --> 01:25:21.304
I deny all accusations.
What do you want?


1097
01:25:21.415 --> 01:25:23.645
I have just narrowly
avoided having a buggering.


1098
01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:26.720
I've come in here with the express
intention of wishing one on you.


1099
01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:29.381
Having said that, I now
intend to leave for London.


1100
01:25:29.490 --> 01:25:32.015
Hold on. Don't let your
imagination run away with you.


1101
01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:34.424
Imagination? I just finished
fighting a naked man.


1102
01:25:34.528 --> 01:25:36.996
How dare you tell him
I'm a toilet trader!


1103
01:25:37.097 --> 01:25:39.657
It was a tactical necessity.

1104
01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:42.600
If I hadn't told him you were active,
we'd never have got the cottage.


1105
01:25:42.703 --> 01:25:44.603
I never have wanted
it... not with him in it!


1106
01:25:44.705 --> 01:25:48.471
Geez. He'd come all this way.

1107
01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:52.876
<i>- Monty? He'd go to New York.
- It was a calculated risk.</i>


1108
01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:55.574
What is all this tactical
necessity and calculated risk?


1109
01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:58.379
This is me naked in a corner!

1110
01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:01.080
And how dare you
tell him I love you.

1111
01:26:01.188 --> 01:26:04.021
And how dare you tell
him you rejected me.


1112
01:26:04.124 --> 01:26:07.059
<i>- How dare you tell him that!
- Sorry about that.</i>


1113
01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:10.528
Got a bit carried away. Sort
of said it without thinking.


1114
01:26:10.631 --> 01:26:14.158
<i>Let me tell you something, Withnail. If
he comes into my room again, it's murder,</i>


1115
01:26:14.268 --> 01:26:17.260
and you will be held responsible in law.

1116
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:26.407
"Perhaps it is appropriate
justice for the eavesdropper...


1117
01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:29.881
"that he should leave as
his trade determines...


1118
01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:34.080
"in secrecy and in the dead of night.

1119
01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:37.885
<i>- "I do sincerely hope that
you will find the happiness...</i>


1120
01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:41.553
"which, alas, has
always been denied to me.


1121
01:26:43.497 --> 01:26:46.557
"I am yours ever faithfully,

1122
01:26:46.667 --> 01:26:48.567
Montague H. Withnail. "

1123
01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:52.705
Poor old bastard.

1124
01:26:52.806 --> 01:26:54.706
I would say...

1125
01:26:56.243 --> 01:27:00.339
that that represents
a degree of hypocrisy...


1126
01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:05.043
I've hitherto suspected in you but not
noticed, due to highly evasive skills.


1127
01:27:05.152 --> 01:27:09.111
Christ, Withnail.
You'll suffer for this.


1128
01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:11.657
What you have done will
have to be paid for.


1129
01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.727
I will say one thing for Monty.

1130
01:27:13.827 --> 01:27:16.022
He keeps a sensational cellar.

1131
01:27:25.839 --> 01:27:28.467
<i>- Who's there?
- Telegram.</i>


1132
01:27:52.466 --> 01:27:54.900
Well done.

1133
01:27:55.002 --> 01:27:58.904
Well, it doesn't mean to say I've got it.
They probably just want to see me again.


1134
01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:04.935
Well, that settles it, then.
We'll leave immediately.


1135
01:28:05.045 --> 01:28:07.809
What?

1136
01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:11.078
- Get your kit together. We're leaving in half an hour.
- Half an hour?


1137
01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:14.086
Don't be ridiculous. I need
at least an hour for lunch.


1138
01:28:22.863 --> 01:28:26.822
You've got a truck coming
up. About 200 yards.


1139
01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:30.529
Followed by a left slow hander.

1140
01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:33.471
This is insanity! 
I can't keep this up!

1141
01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:37.135
Stay in this lane.
Bear right. Bear right.


1142
01:28:37.244 --> 01:28:39.804
What lane? What lane? I
can't see the fucking lane.


1143
01:28:39.913 --> 01:28:42.347
Bear right! Bear right! Bear right!

1144
01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:49.722
That's it. Next garage, I've gotta
do something about that wiper.


1145
01:28:49.823 --> 01:28:53.554
And I've got to get some sleep.

1146
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.721
- What's going on?
- I'm making time.


1147
01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:41.207
<i>Are you out of your mind? Pull
over. You haven't got a license.</i>


1148
01:29:41.308 --> 01:29:43.276
No. I'm making time.

1149
01:29:53.787 --> 01:29:56.187
- Where are we?
- We're approaching London.


1150
01:29:59.359 --> 01:30:03.625
- Here comes another fucker.

1151
01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:14.367
- Oh, no!

1152
01:30:14.475 --> 01:30:17.342
Perfectly all right. 
Leave him to me.

1153
01:30:17.444 --> 01:30:20.242
You're full of scotch, you silly tool.

1154
01:31:30.851 --> 01:31:34.309
A bit early in the morning
for festivities, isn't it?


1155
01:31:34.421 --> 01:31:36.719
These aren't mine. 
They belong to him.

1156
01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:40.624
- You're drunk.
- I assure you I'm not, officer.


1157
01:31:40.727 --> 01:31:43.992
Honestly, I've only had a few ales.

1158
01:31:44.097 --> 01:31:48.090
Out of the car... please.

1159
01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.102
Sir.

1160
01:31:57.144 --> 01:32:00.079
I want you to take one deep
breath and fill this bag.


1161
01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:05.379
- Are you refusing to fill this bag?
- I most certainly am.


1162
01:32:05.485 --> 01:32:08.716
- I'm placing you under arrest.
- Don't be ridiculous. I haven't done anything.


1163
01:32:08.822 --> 01:32:11.017
- Come on.
- Look here, my cousin's a QC.


1164
01:32:11.124 --> 01:32:13.024
Get in the back of the van!

1165
01:32:26.139 --> 01:32:28.539
Hey, sarge, what's that clown doing?

1166
01:33:04.344 --> 01:33:07.745
- Where's our checks?
- Didn't sign on.


1167
01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:11.079
That wouldn't make any difference
in last week's payments.


1168
01:33:39.346 --> 01:33:42.110
What are you doing in my bed?

1169
01:33:42.215 --> 01:33:46.709
- I've been asleep.
- Who is the huge spade in the bath?


1170
01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:49.220
Presuming Ed.

1171
01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:52.190
You've got ten minutes, right? I
want you out 'cause I want to get in.


1172
01:33:52.292 --> 01:33:54.920
Ten minutes, right? You
better be on your feet.


1173
01:33:58.298 --> 01:34:01.495
- How did you get in?
- Ingenuity, man.


1174
01:34:01.601 --> 01:34:03.865
Come up the drain pipe.

1175
01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:07.031
- Would you like a smoke?
- Yes.


1176
01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:09.574
No, thanks. I've got a call to make.

1177
01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:16.015
What are you gonna do with those?

1178
01:34:16.116 --> 01:34:20.450
The joint I'm about to
roll requires a craftsman.


1179
01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:23.045
It can utilize up to 12 skins.

1180
01:34:23.156 --> 01:34:26.125
It is called a Camberwell Carrot.

1181
01:34:26.226 --> 01:34:28.626
It's impossible to use

1182
01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:32.426
It's impossible to make a
Camberwell Carrot with anything less.


1183
01:34:32.532 --> 01:34:35.296
- Who says it's a Camberwell Carrot?
- I do.


1184
01:34:35.402 --> 01:34:39.202
I invented it in Camberwell,
and it looks like a carrot.


1185
01:34:39.306 --> 01:34:42.400
Do you realize this gaff's
overwhelmed with rodents?


1186
01:34:42.509 --> 01:34:45.069
When I come in, I seen one
the size of a fucking dog.


1187
01:34:45.178 --> 01:34:48.306
<i>That is a dog. Belongs
to the fellow downstairs.</i>


1188
01:34:48.415 --> 01:34:50.576
Does his dog get in the oven?

1189
01:34:50.684 --> 01:34:53.915
- No, his dog doesn't come up here.
- Then it was a rodent.


1190
01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:57.218
Opened the oven door, and it
was in there looking at me.


1191
01:34:57.324 --> 01:35:01.590
Quite freaked me at the
time. I was gonna cook onions.


1192
01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:03.890
- Are you going to bed now?
- No.


1193
01:35:03.997 --> 01:35:05.897
Phone.

1194
01:35:08.068 --> 01:35:11.060
- Who's he going to telephone?
- Squat Betty.


1195
01:35:12.539 --> 01:35:15.906
His agent. He's wasting his
time because he won't be in.


1196
01:35:39.933 --> 01:35:43.130
This'll tend to make you very high.

1197
01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:50.901
This grass is the most powerful
in the Western Hemisphere.


1198
01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:55.141
I have it specially flown
in from my man in Mexico.


1199
01:35:56.616 --> 01:35:58.914
He's an expert.

1200
01:35:59.019 --> 01:36:01.487
His name is Juan.

1201
01:36:01.588 --> 01:36:06.685
This grass grows at exactly

1202
01:36:08.929 --> 01:36:11.261
You got the part, man?

1203
01:36:15.802 --> 01:36:20.171
I got a different one. They
want me to play the lead.


1204
01:36:20.273 --> 01:36:24.107
- Congratulations.
- Where exactly have you two been?


1205
01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:28.375
- Holiday in the countryside.
- That's a very good idea.


1206
01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:31.474
London is a country
coming down from its trip.


1207
01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:35.783
<i>We are 91 days from
the end of this decade,</i>


1208
01:36:35.889 --> 01:36:39.017
and there's gonna be a lot of refugees.

1209
01:36:41.928 --> 01:36:46.228
They'll be goin' round this town
shoutin', "Bring out your dead. "


1210
01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:51.596
There was a geezer around here
the other day lookin' for you.


1211
01:36:51.705 --> 01:36:53.969
<i>- What geezer?
- Some bald geezer.</i>


1212
01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:58.408
Reckons you owe him 266 quid back rent.

1213
01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:03.506
I told him there's no question of payin'
rent on a property cut with rodents.


1214
01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:05.744
He takes exception to this.

1215
01:37:05.852 --> 01:37:08.343
Starts comin' on really bald with me.

1216
01:37:08.455 --> 01:37:11.822
- You mean ratty.
- I told him to piss off.


1217
01:37:11.925 --> 01:37:14.155
You bloody fool. We'll
end up in court again.


1218
01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:17.697
<i>- No we won't. It ain't legal.
- I assume we can quote you.</i>


1219
01:37:17.797 --> 01:37:21.460
The law rather appeals to me, actually.

1220
01:37:26.673 --> 01:37:29.665
<i>Just high.</i>

1221
01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:33.378
Stop laughing, Withnail.
This is serious.


1222
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:37.314
No, it ain't. I looked
into it, studied the papers.


1223
01:37:37.417 --> 01:37:40.477
- What papers?
- Legal papers.


1224
01:37:40.587 --> 01:37:43.215
<i>What papers, Danny?</i>

1225
01:37:53.266 --> 01:37:56.497
He's got our checks. What
are you doing with these?


1226
01:37:56.603 --> 01:38:00.232
<i>I was gonna cash 'em in for you.</i>

1227
01:38:08.348 --> 01:38:12.341
For Christ's sake, Withnail, stop
laughing. This is a notice of eviction.


1228
01:38:19.459 --> 01:38:21.757
Will you stop laughing?
They wanna throw us out.


1229
01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:27.465
For God... Will you shut up, for
God's sake? You're giving me the fear.


1230
01:38:27.567 --> 01:38:29.626
<i>Give me a downer, Danny.
My brain's capsizing.</i>


1231
01:38:29.736 --> 01:38:31.863
- I've gone and fucked my brain!
- Change, man.


1232
01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:35.373
<i>Find your neutral
space. You've got a rush.</i>


1233
01:38:35.475 --> 01:38:38.638
It will pass. Be seated.

1234
01:38:45.518 --> 01:38:47.418
Aren't you getting absurdly high?

1235
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.887
Precisely the reason I'm smokin' it.

1236
01:38:56.162 --> 01:38:58.187
I couldn't. I'm spaced.

1237
01:38:58.298 --> 01:39:00.323
Not as spaced as your rodents.

1238
01:39:00.433 --> 01:39:04.563
- Don't talk about them.
- I imagine they're talkin' to each other.


1239
01:39:06.973 --> 01:39:09.407
<i>- What do you mean?
- I've dealt with 'em.</i>


1240
01:39:09.509 --> 01:39:11.409
Dealt with 'em. What
the fuck do you mean?


1241
01:39:11.511 --> 01:39:15.174
Dosed 'em. I expect
they're dead down the drain.


1242
01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:18.251
Dead down the drain? What
have you done to them?


1243
01:39:18.351 --> 01:39:21.809
Given them all drugged onions.

1244
01:39:21.921 --> 01:39:24.754
Jesus Christ! Why have
you drugged their onions?


1245
01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:28.021
Sit down, man. Take control.

1246
01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:30.858
Give me a Valium. 
I'm getting the fear!

1247
01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:33.262
<i>You have done something to your brain.</i>

1248
01:39:33.366 --> 01:39:35.266
You have made it high.

1249
01:39:35.368 --> 01:39:40.305
If I lay ten mils of Diazepam on you,
you will do something else to your brain.


1250
01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:44.605
You will make it low. Why trust
one drug and not the other?


1251
01:39:44.711 --> 01:39:46.611
That's politics, isn't it?

1252
01:39:46.713 --> 01:39:48.613
I'm gonna eat some sugar.

1253
01:39:50.216 --> 01:39:52.946
I recommend you smoke some more grass.

1254
01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:55.681
No way. No fucking way.

1255
01:39:55.789 --> 01:39:59.088
That is an unfortunate
political decision,


1256
01:39:59.192 --> 01:40:01.592
reflectin' these times.

1257
01:40:08.768 --> 01:40:11.328
<i>- What are you talking about, Danny?
- Politics, man.</i>


1258
01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:13.963
If you were hanging
on to a rising balloon,


1259
01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:16.736
you're presented with
a difficult decision...


1260
01:40:16.843 --> 01:40:19.209
let go before it's too late?

1261
01:40:19.312 --> 01:40:21.303
Or hang on and keep getting higher?

1262
01:40:21.414 --> 01:40:26.044
Posing the question, how long
can you keep a grip on the rope?


1263
01:40:27.987 --> 01:40:30.683
They're sellin' hippie
wigs in Woolworth's, man.


1264
01:40:32.225 --> 01:40:36.389
<i>The greatest decade in the
history of mankind is over.</i>


1265
01:40:38.264 --> 01:40:42.291
And as Presuming Ed here has
so consistently pointed out...


1266
01:40:43.403 --> 01:40:46.600
we have failed to paint it black.

1267
01:41:36.656 --> 01:41:39.716
My Dad'll pick up
the boxes in a week.

1268
01:41:39.826 --> 01:41:42.090
And he's gonna do
something about the car.


1269
01:41:44.197 --> 01:41:46.188
- I'm off now.
- Already?


1270
01:41:46.299 --> 01:41:48.824
But I've got us a bottle open.

1271
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:52.936
I confiscated it from Monty's supplies.

1272
01:41:54.107 --> 01:41:57.235
'53 Margaux. Best of the century.

1273
01:41:58.511 --> 01:42:00.809
I'm sure he wouldn't
resent us a parting drink.


1274
01:42:00.914 --> 01:42:04.077
I can't, Withnail. I've gotta
walk to the station. I'll be late.


1275
01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:07.312
- There's always time for a drink.
- No.


1276
01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:09.752
I don't have the time.

1277
01:42:09.856 --> 01:42:13.519
All right. I'll walk
with you through the park.


1278
01:42:15.528 --> 01:42:17.928
We can drink it on the way.

1279
01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:28.564
No. No more, thank you.

1280
01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:31.166
Listen, Withnail. It's a
stinker. Why don't you go back?


1281
01:42:31.277 --> 01:42:34.212
- Because I wanna walk you to the station.
- Well, don't.


1282
01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:36.782
Please don't.

1283
01:42:36.883 --> 01:42:38.942
I really don't want you to.

1284
01:42:47.994 --> 01:42:51.452
I shall miss you, Withnail.

1285
01:42:51.564 --> 01:42:56.194
<i>I shall miss you too. 
Chin-chin.</i>

1286
