1
00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:53.003
Job for Maximus.

2
00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:55.172
I have coordinates.

3
00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.134
Request pickup at
rendezvous alpha.


4
00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.428
Operation is a go.

5
00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.132
Grenade.

6
00:08:23.153 --> 00:08:24.321
It's locked.

7
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:27.324
- Get out of the way.

8
00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:59.314
Proceed according to
plan, rendezvous in Canada.


9
00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:01.775
I will be at the drop
point north of the border.


10
00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.526
The
pilot's standing by.


11
00:09:03.526 --> 00:09:06.488
Dark comms, we
cannot fuck this up.


12
00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:37.347
Hey, Bill.

13
00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:39.307
Jackson, what are you up to?

14
00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:43.394
I'm just hanging around.

15
00:11:44.187 --> 00:11:45.897
Well, I've got a
client here looking


16
00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:47.941
for a guy for an elk hunt.

17
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.527
Uh, would you be interested
in coming up to the lodge?


18
00:11:50.527 --> 00:11:53.238
Yeah, I could use the work.

19
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.365
Wife's been bugging
me to book something.


20
00:11:56.074 --> 00:11:57.158
Ah, perfect.

21
00:11:57.158 --> 00:11:59.244
Um, opening day is Saturday.

22
00:11:59.244 --> 00:12:00.745
I'll see you at the lodge.

23
00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:02.705
Book you in the
same hotel as usual.


24
00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.292
Thanks, I'll see
you at the lodge.


25
00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:25.955
Babe.

26
00:13:27.832 --> 00:13:29.375
Babe, I'm home.

27
00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:30.627
What the fuck?

28
00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:32.170
- You said you-
- What the fuck?


29
00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:33.087
- You said you weren't-
- What the fuck, this guy?


30
00:13:33.087 --> 00:13:34.589
- Coming home till tomorrow.
- You fucking kidding me?


31
00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:35.298
This guy?

32
00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:36.132
- Wait you fucking-
- are you kidding?


33
00:13:36.174 --> 00:13:36.883
What are you doing?

34
00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:38.801
- My problem?
- What the fuck is your problem?


35
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:39.677
What is your problem?

36
00:13:39.677 --> 00:13:42.180
- Oh, you had no idea?
- Oh, my God.


37
00:13:42.513 --> 00:13:43.556
- You had no idea?

38
00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:44.515
- You had no idea?
- What the fuck is


39
00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:45.683
- wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?


40
00:13:45.683 --> 00:13:47.435
- What's wrong with you?
- Are you fucking serious?


41
00:13:47.435 --> 00:13:48.937
- You're my wife.
- Oh, my God.


42
00:13:48.937 --> 00:13:50.104
It doesn't feel like it

43
00:13:50.104 --> 00:13:52.232
because every fucking
day leave me here.


44
00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:54.734
And then you go off into the
fucking mountains by yourself.


45
00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:56.236
What do you expect?

46
00:13:56.236 --> 00:13:56.945
Let me go, man.

47
00:13:56.945 --> 00:13:58.238
- You're a freak, honey.
- I expect you


48
00:13:58.238 --> 00:13:59.989
to act like my wife.

49
00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:02.158
We died with Haley. We died.

50
00:14:02.158 --> 00:14:04.577
I wish, I wish that
I died with Haley.


51
00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:07.413
You're so fucking sad.

52
00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:08.456
Take your Goddamn wedding ring.

53
00:14:08.456 --> 00:14:09.791
I am so done.

54
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:10.583
- We're not done.

55
00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.669
We are so done.

56
00:14:14.128 --> 00:14:15.713
Good
morning, Montana,


57
00:14:15.713 --> 00:14:17.215
a small plane crash just south

58
00:14:17.215 --> 00:14:19.092
of the Canadian
border last night.


59
00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.927
Officials believe
there was no survivors,


60
00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:22.845
and only the pilot was killed.

61
00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:25.223
In other news, opening
of hunting season is


62
00:14:25.223 --> 00:14:27.350
just two days away with
temps looking to drop.


63
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.518
It should be a good one.

64
00:14:28.518 --> 00:14:30.353
The time is 7:48 AM.

65
00:14:30.353 --> 00:14:32.105
Now, back to the country hits.

66
00:15:46.471 --> 00:15:48.181
We'll go find our room.

67
00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:49.390
But you said

68
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.017
We would go get some ice cream.

69
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.145
Well, we just have
to go find our room first.


70
00:15:55.063 --> 00:15:55.855
Excuse me.

71
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.065
Excuse me.

72
00:16:00.068 --> 00:16:01.194
You dropped this.

73
00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:02.236
Thank you.

74
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.530
You're welcome.

75
00:18:07.445 --> 00:18:08.654
The last
known coordinates


76
00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.823
from the pilot were
in this region.


77
00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.992
It is presumed the
package is with him.


78
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.537
We believe the piloted
ejected before the crash.


79
00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:24.462
The package is in the wild.

80
00:18:24.462 --> 00:18:26.839
It must be captured
at all costs.


81
00:18:27.131 --> 00:18:29.050
Use all means necessary.

82
00:18:30.426 --> 00:18:31.677
This is tango leader.

83
00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:34.055
Is there any chance there are
packages with the wreckage?


84
00:18:34.055 --> 00:18:36.849
Negative, we've
searched the crash site.


85
00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.601
It has to be with the pilot.

86
00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:40.937
Then, we'll find him.

87
00:18:40.937 --> 00:18:41.938
Whiskey seven out.

88
00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:07.004
Jimmy, let me
tell you something.


89
00:19:07.004 --> 00:19:08.214
That's no bullshit.

90
00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:12.218
If that nun weighted a
pound, she weighed 300.


91
00:19:12.426 --> 00:19:13.386
We used to talk.

92
00:19:16.138 --> 00:19:23.896
a“ Ah,ah.“

93
00:19:48.129 --> 00:19:50.006
Sorry, new
waitress got slammed.


94
00:19:50.006 --> 00:19:51.340
What can I get you?

95
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:52.758
Just a beer.

96
00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:54.343
You got a preference?

97
00:19:54.468 --> 00:19:55.970
You got Mountains Walking?

98
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.305
Yeah, I got Mountains Walking.

99
00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:03.144
Well, obviously she needs
a little more training.


100
00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:27.960
Oh, come on, baby, it's okay.

101
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.503
It's just spilled
milk, all right?


102
00:20:29.503 --> 00:20:31.631
Don't worry yourself over it,

103
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:32.923
but I'll tell you what.

104
00:20:32.923 --> 00:20:34.925
I am gonna have to
clean that milk up.


105
00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:36.260
I'd better use this mop

106
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.262
- that I have here my hands.

107
00:20:38.888 --> 00:20:39.764
Clean it up.

108
00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:40.598
Cleaning.

109
00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:46.020
Jackson, Jackson.

110
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.357
Jackson.

111
00:20:49.398 --> 00:20:50.566
Oh, Jackson.

112
00:20:50.941 --> 00:20:52.943
Jackson, Earth to Jackson.

113
00:20:53.527 --> 00:20:54.654
Are ya all right?

114
00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:56.113
I'm a little worried about ya.

115
00:20:56.614 --> 00:20:58.157
Murph, hey.

116
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.995
And, uh, what happened
to the moosh there?


117
00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:06.290
Nothing.

118
00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:08.668
None of my business.

119
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:12.296
But, uh, that
reminds me of a joke


120
00:21:12.296 --> 00:21:14.340
the old man told me
when I was a kid.


121
00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.510
Guy gets in the subway train.

122
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.803
He's got a black eye.

123
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:21.222
Sits down next to another guy,

124
00:21:21.222 --> 00:21:23.140
and the other guy's
got a black eye.


125
00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:25.726
And he says to him,
uh, "Hey, buddy,


126
00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:27.395
how'd you get your black eye?"

127
00:21:27.895 --> 00:21:31.774
And he goes, uh, "Uh, I was
looking to go on vacation.


128
00:21:31.774 --> 00:21:33.693
So, I went into a travel agency,

129
00:21:33.693 --> 00:21:37.113
and, uh, here's
this hottie blonde


130
00:21:37.113 --> 00:21:39.073
with a big rack and
a tight sweater.


131
00:21:39.407 --> 00:21:42.576
I wanna ask her for two
tickets to Pittsburgh.


132
00:21:42.827 --> 00:21:45.871
And I ended up asking her for
two pickets to Tittsburgh."


133
00:21:47.957 --> 00:21:49.375
Uh, he looks at at
him, and he goes,


134
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:51.127
"How'd you get your black eye?"

135
00:21:51.127 --> 00:21:54.088
"I came down to sit at
the breakfast table,


136
00:21:54.088 --> 00:21:56.465
and the wife asked me
what I'd like to have,


137
00:21:56.465 --> 00:22:00.428
and what I wanted to say was,
'A bowl of Post Toasties,'


138
00:22:00.428 --> 00:22:01.929
but what I ended up saying was,

139
00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:04.515
'You fucking whore,
you've ruined my life.


140
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:10.521
That's a good one.

141
00:22:10.521 --> 00:22:12.148
That is a good one, Murph.

142
00:22:12.148 --> 00:22:13.524
The last time you told it to me,

143
00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:16.694
the last time, they were
on a bus, but I think,


144
00:22:16.694 --> 00:22:20.698
I think the subway, subway
is much, much better.


145
00:22:21.365 --> 00:22:22.116
Way better.

146
00:22:22.116 --> 00:22:23.242
Oh, I know.

147
00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:24.744
Ah.

148
00:22:24.744 --> 00:22:29.039
Hey, anyway, I heard what
happened at your house


149
00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:30.958
with that little asshole, Robby.

150
00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:33.502
That wasn't right.

151
00:22:34.462 --> 00:22:36.046
Let me tell you, that
little douche bag,


152
00:22:36.046 --> 00:22:37.882
I fucking taught him
everything he knows


153
00:22:37.882 --> 00:22:42.219
about service work, heating,
plumbing, all right?


154
00:22:42.845 --> 00:22:45.181
You want me to take him
out behind a plumbing shop


155
00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:47.558
and straighten his ass
out, I'll fucking do that.


156
00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:48.934
No, look.

157
00:22:49.477 --> 00:22:50.644
Appreciate it, okay?

158
00:22:50.644 --> 00:22:52.897
It's my life, my problem.

159
00:22:52.897 --> 00:22:53.898
I'll take care of it.

160
00:22:53.898 --> 00:22:56.025
Hey, you gimme
the word, I'll take him


161
00:22:56.025 --> 00:22:58.402
out back and get all
Jersey all over his shit.


162
00:22:59.153 --> 00:23:00.362
It's all good.

163
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.948
We all right with that?

164
00:23:04.492 --> 00:23:05.993
I'm sorry about that.

165
00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:16.629
Anyway, I'm supposed
to pick up this guy


166
00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:19.256
coming in from Canada,
and God knows where he is.


167
00:23:19.256 --> 00:23:22.092
He's running a little late,
but anyway, I gotta go.


168
00:23:22.092 --> 00:23:23.177
We all right?

169
00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:25.095
All right, we'll
catch up with you.


170
00:23:25.095 --> 00:23:26.972
- All right, brother.
- All right, later.


171
00:24:49.722 --> 00:24:50.639
Let me go.

172
00:24:50.764 --> 00:24:52.391
Get away from me.

173
00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:54.393
Someone help me.

174
00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:56.186
Stop, no, stop.

175
00:24:56.186 --> 00:24:57.438
I mean it.

176
00:24:58.272 --> 00:24:59.857
I mean it, stop.

177
00:25:01.984 --> 00:25:02.943
Stop.

178
00:25:02.943 --> 00:25:05.029
Hey, I mean it, stop.

179
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:16.206
Thank you.

180
00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:50.032
Who'd you piss off?

181
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.576
You know, usual story.

182
00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:53.911
You know, came
down to breakfast,


183
00:25:53.911 --> 00:25:56.372
and wife asked me what I wanted.

184
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.582
I wanted to tell her I'd
like a bowl of cereal,


185
00:25:58.582 --> 00:26:02.419
but instead, I said,
"You fucking whore.


186
00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:03.963
You ruined my life ."

187
00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:06.048
She, uh, she smacked me.

188
00:26:06.048 --> 00:26:08.092
Well, good to see you
haven't changed much.


189
00:26:08.092 --> 00:26:10.135
Yeah, how are the elk doing?

190
00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:11.261
Oh, they're still up high.

191
00:26:11.261 --> 00:26:12.221
It's been pretty warm.

192
00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:13.764
Should be coming
down soon, though.


193
00:26:13.764 --> 00:26:15.516
Hope my guy likes walking.

194
00:26:15.516 --> 00:26:16.934
Client's not a guy.

195
00:26:17.267 --> 00:26:18.185
What?

196
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.480
There she is.

197
00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:32.074
Hi.

198
00:26:34.868 --> 00:26:35.911
I'm Kate.

199
00:26:39.832 --> 00:26:40.958
Jackson.

200
00:27:03.897 --> 00:27:05.899
My father always wanted
to take me hunting,


201
00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:07.568
but he never did it.

202
00:27:08.402 --> 00:27:10.821
When he passed, I felt it
would be a good way to connect.


203
00:27:10.821 --> 00:27:13.657
So, I made the jump
and moved to Montana.


204
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:16.035
I don't even have
an apartment yet.


205
00:27:16.035 --> 00:27:17.619
I've been staying at that motel.

206
00:27:21.582 --> 00:27:23.125
I'm riding with his ashes.

207
00:27:24.501 --> 00:27:26.420
I'd like to spread them
when we get an elk.


208
00:27:27.713 --> 00:27:30.007
It's funny the things we
regret when a loved one dies.


209
00:27:32.926 --> 00:27:35.137
It's hard to connect
when you've lost someone.


210
00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:38.849
Hunting isn't about talking.

211
00:27:39.641 --> 00:27:41.393
Thought we were just
riding to high camp.


212
00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:44.563
We are, and we're
gonna do it quietly.


213
00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:47.232
Animals know when
they're being hunted,


214
00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:52.946
so pretty please
with sugar on top-


215
00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:54.531
Shut the fuck up?

216
00:28:14.551 --> 00:28:16.011
That's your tent over there.

217
00:28:16.804 --> 00:28:18.180
Make yourself comfortable.

218
00:28:19.139 --> 00:28:20.307
I'll get the horses settled in,

219
00:28:20.307 --> 00:28:21.767
and then I'll start on dinner.

220
00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:25.062
Pull out your rain gear.

221
00:28:25.062 --> 00:28:26.772
I'll put it in my
pack for tomorrow,


222
00:28:27.064 --> 00:28:28.398
cut down on your weight.

223
00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:30.609
We're gonna be putting
down a lot of miles.


224
00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:36.740
Never gets old.

225
00:28:56.218 --> 00:28:58.011
This is alpha one.

226
00:28:58.011 --> 00:28:59.930
I'm on the northern ridge side.

227
00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:02.141
No indication of the pilot yet.

228
00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.860
This is whiskey seven.

229
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.486
I've got nothing to your six.

230
00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:15.946
I'm moving to your position.

231
00:29:19.783 --> 00:29:20.909
This is tango leader.

232
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:23.662
We've got nothing in the
third or fourth quadrant.


233
00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:39.469
So, sun up tomorrow's it 7:56.

234
00:29:41.555 --> 00:29:44.600
Means the first
legal shot's 7:41.


235
00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:48.437
We wanna be in
position 7:15 latest.


236
00:29:48.437 --> 00:29:50.564
It's about hour
walk to get there,


237
00:29:51.273 --> 00:29:54.234
- so breakfast 5:30.

238
00:29:56.153 --> 00:29:59.198
I'd like to split up
to cover more ground.


239
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.116
No.

240
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:02.534
Why not?

241
00:30:04.494 --> 00:30:06.246
Because this is a guided hunt.

242
00:30:06.955 --> 00:30:08.165
Can't split up.

243
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.294
But wouldn't we have a
better shot of getting an elk?


244
00:30:13.921 --> 00:30:15.130
I'm not hunting.

245
00:30:15.589 --> 00:30:16.673
I'm guiding.

246
00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:19.051
What's the difference?

247
00:30:20.594 --> 00:30:23.138
I'm here to keep you safe

248
00:30:23.138 --> 00:30:26.516
and, um, take care
of your needs.


249
00:30:28.644 --> 00:30:30.187
I like the sound of that.

250
00:30:31.647 --> 00:30:34.107
There's grizzlies, okay?

251
00:30:34.608 --> 00:30:35.817
You could cross into Canada.

252
00:30:35.817 --> 00:30:37.986
You could accidentally
shoot an illegal animal.


253
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.864
Are we that close to Canada?

254
00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:43.367
An illegal animal?

255
00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:45.369
Yeah.

256
00:30:48.372 --> 00:30:49.414
You know the difference

257
00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:51.416
between a brown-tined
bull and a spike bull?


258
00:30:52.376 --> 00:30:57.422
Or, how about what side of
the creek section 314 ends


259
00:30:57.422 --> 00:31:00.676
and 317 begins, making it
illegal to shoot a cow?


260
00:31:01.176 --> 00:31:05.097
Or, what are you gonna
do, shoot a bull,


261
00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:08.433
runs off into somebody's
private field, hmm?


262
00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:16.024
A spike bull is an elk with
antlers that do not branch.


263
00:31:16.858 --> 00:31:19.653
You can't shoot a bull
east of Mill Creek.


264
00:31:19.653 --> 00:31:23.365
And if your cow end's up in
a private field this far out,


265
00:31:23.365 --> 00:31:25.033
you should be a better shot.

266
00:31:27.494 --> 00:31:31.748
Just 'cause I'm a girl doesn't
mean I don't know shit, 'kay?


267
00:31:32.582 --> 00:31:36.169
If you have something
to say, say it.


268
00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.718
Well, I look forward to
showing you an adventure.


269
00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:47.931
I bet you will.

270
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.979
You know, just 'cause
you read a book about it


271
00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:58.775
or you know, watched a
hunting show doesn't mean


272
00:31:58.775 --> 00:32:00.068
anybody can do this.

273
00:32:02.863 --> 00:32:06.241
That is why I hired you.

274
00:32:46.656 --> 00:32:47.824
I put it right here.

275
00:32:47.908 --> 00:32:48.700
It's pretty good.

276
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.951
- I like that.

277
00:32:53.914 --> 00:32:55.457
Look, Hailey,
Daddy's got the ball.


278
00:32:55.457 --> 00:32:56.333
Throw me the ball.

279
00:32:56.333 --> 00:32:57.584
- Throw me the ball.

280
00:32:57.584 --> 00:32:59.711
Okay, ready?

281
00:33:04.174 --> 00:33:05.092
Here it comes.

282
00:33:06.093 --> 00:33:07.344
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.


283
00:33:07.344 --> 00:33:08.678
Nice job.

284
00:33:08.678 --> 00:33:09.846
Again, again.

285
00:33:18.647 --> 00:33:20.732
All right, here
comes a deep pass.


286
00:33:27.072 --> 00:33:27.989
No.

287
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.245
- Oh, my God.

288
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.521
Sh.

289
00:34:45.859 --> 00:34:47.068
Did you hear 'em?

290
00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:49.613
They're right up there.

291
00:34:49.613 --> 00:34:53.492
We're gonna go, but
go really quietly.


292
00:35:05.545 --> 00:35:06.588
Sh.

293
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.806
- Sh.

294
00:35:35.742 --> 00:35:39.120
It's funny, we, we
know they're so close,


295
00:35:39.663 --> 00:35:41.039
but they can feel the pressure,

296
00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:43.583
and they just, just move on.

297
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.169
We should split up.

298
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:49.589
Not a chance.

299
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.006
Up.

300
00:36:31.506 --> 00:36:34.467
Yeah, it's pretty big.

301
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:36.386
You know, grizzly bears

302
00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:39.639
in this area actually
run towards gunshots.


303
00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:40.599
Why?

304
00:36:40.974 --> 00:36:44.519
Because they've learned
it's usually a hunter's kill,


305
00:36:44.853 --> 00:36:47.105
trying to get a nice, easy
meal before hibernation.


306
00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:47.981
Ah.

307
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:49.566
Come on.

308
00:36:49.566 --> 00:36:51.901
That thing doesn't wanna
have anything to do with us.


309
00:38:22.742 --> 00:38:24.160
Look at that.

310
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.453
What is it?

311
00:38:25.453 --> 00:38:26.705
It's a print.

312
00:38:27.163 --> 00:38:28.289
Elk?

313
00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:30.709
Yeah, looks pretty fresh.

314
00:38:38.216 --> 00:38:39.259
Come on.

315
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:47.851
Might be something up there.

316
00:38:49.978 --> 00:38:51.187
I'm too tired.

317
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.774
It's getting late.

318
00:38:55.483 --> 00:38:57.360
We've been at it for 10 hours.

319
00:39:00.196 --> 00:39:03.324
Okay, I'm gonna go to
the top of the ridge.


320
00:39:04.033 --> 00:39:05.869
If there's a herd
of elk up there,


321
00:39:06.661 --> 00:39:08.288
at least we'll
know for tomorrow.


322
00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:43.354
Kate.

323
00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:47.358
Kate.

324
00:43:51.029 --> 00:43:52.196
What happened?

325
00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:52.989
You okay?

326
00:43:52.989 --> 00:43:54.532
I took a shot at a bull.

327
00:43:55.116 --> 00:43:55.825
What?

328
00:43:55.825 --> 00:43:58.703
A bull elk, I took
a shot, and I missed.


329
00:43:59.412 --> 00:44:01.122
Did you see anything up there?

330
00:44:01.289 --> 00:44:02.123
Me?

331
00:44:03.583 --> 00:44:08.212
Uh, yeah, I, I saw
a bull elk, too.


332
00:44:10.048 --> 00:44:11.883
Guess we should
start here tomorrow.


333
00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:15.720
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:20.141
We still gotta
drop your dad off.


335
00:44:20.141 --> 00:44:21.100
What?

336
00:44:21.976 --> 00:44:24.103
The ashes in the urn.

337
00:44:24.103 --> 00:44:26.105
Yeah.

338
00:44:26.606 --> 00:44:29.776
All right, let's, uh,
let's get back to camp.


339
00:44:33.071 --> 00:44:35.156
So, what
got you into hunting?


340
00:44:36.449 --> 00:44:37.408
Well, I dunno.

341
00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.993
I had the experience.

342
00:44:50.797 --> 00:44:56.511
So, tell me, did you really
come out here to shoot an elk,


343
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:59.305
spread your father's ashes,

344
00:45:01.099 --> 00:45:03.392
start a new life
in Big Sky Country?


345
00:45:05.853 --> 00:45:08.439
Daddy wasn't cut
out to be a dad.


346
00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:17.115
I'd like to say he did
his best, but he didn't.


347
00:45:20.201 --> 00:45:25.248
I wanted to come up here
to truly put him to rest.


348
00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:29.794
I, I hope we will tomorrow.

349
00:45:47.603 --> 00:45:49.605
Stop pushing me away, Jackson.

350
00:45:52.358 --> 00:45:57.488
I won't let you do
this to me, to us.


351
00:45:59.073 --> 00:46:00.783
We can get through
this together.


352
00:46:00.783 --> 00:46:03.369
We can be there for each other.

353
00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:06.247
You just, you gotta let me in.

354
00:46:06.956 --> 00:46:08.875
There's a part of
me that's missing,


355
00:46:11.544 --> 00:46:16.757
a part of me that never
came back and died.


356
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:23.890
And every day, I, I wait
for it to come back.


357
00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:30.438
Then, every day, I'm
disappointed because there it is


358
00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:32.857
just waving at me,

359
00:46:34.442 --> 00:46:39.363
reminding me, taunting me.

360
00:46:45.953 --> 00:46:46.954
But what?

361
00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:51.792
But what, Jackson?

362
00:46:51.792 --> 00:46:56.172
You say you wanna be here
with me, to be here now,


363
00:46:56.172 --> 00:46:58.466
so do it.

364
00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.762
I lost Haley, too.

365
00:47:05.681 --> 00:47:09.227
We can get through all of
this together, you and me.


366
00:47:09.227 --> 00:47:10.561
We can do this.

367
00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:14.065
You gotta trust me.

368
00:47:16.817 --> 00:47:20.071
We can make it through
all of this together.


369
00:47:21.322 --> 00:47:23.199
You need to trust me.

370
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:24.135
Got colder last night.

371
00:48:26.762 --> 00:48:28.222
Try some pants.

372
00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:31.309
No, it's all right.

373
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:33.644
It reminds me of boarding
school in Russia.


374
00:48:36.022 --> 00:48:38.607
You went to boarding
school in Russia?


375
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:40.151
Da.

376
00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.612
I told you I'm
full of surprises.


377
00:48:44.363 --> 00:48:45.781
Can I get some coffee?

378
00:48:46.282 --> 00:48:48.701
Yeah, you gotta grind it.

379
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.551
Suspect is armed.

380
00:49:16.729 --> 00:49:19.148
All
right, no sudden moves.


381
00:49:19.148 --> 00:49:21.192
Everyone move in slowly.

382
00:49:34.038 --> 00:49:35.206
Get down, down.

383
00:49:36.665 --> 00:49:38.626
Be advised
target is engaged.


384
00:49:43.798 --> 00:49:44.757
Stay down.

385
00:49:57.228 --> 00:49:58.187
We gotta go.

386
00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.647
My father's urn.

387
00:49:59.647 --> 00:50:00.689
You'll end up in an urn.

388
00:50:00.689 --> 00:50:01.649
Come on.

389
00:50:18.874 --> 00:50:19.667
Good.

390
00:50:36.892 --> 00:50:37.977
Take the shot.

391
00:50:38.185 --> 00:50:39.061
Do it.

392
00:50:56.537 --> 00:50:57.496
Jackson.

393
00:50:59.582 --> 00:51:00.541
Gun.

394
00:51:14.096 --> 00:51:15.055
Let's go.

395
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:18.392
Now.

396
00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:23.522
Target's on foot,
one male, one female.


397
00:51:23.522 --> 00:51:25.566
Package presumed
to be with targets.


398
00:51:25.566 --> 00:51:27.276
Intercept and neutralize.

399
00:51:27.276 --> 00:51:28.235
Copy that, Dina.

400
00:51:28.235 --> 00:51:29.445
We're in pursuit.

401
00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:31.947
Stay with me.

402
00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:33.532
What's happening?

403
00:51:33.532 --> 00:51:34.533
Go, go.

404
00:51:34.867 --> 00:51:36.035
What's going on?

405
00:51:36.035 --> 00:51:37.161
Keep moving.

406
00:51:37.328 --> 00:51:38.537
Jackson, stop.

407
00:51:38.537 --> 00:51:39.288
They're coming.

408
00:51:39.288 --> 00:51:40.456
Jackson, stop.

409
00:51:40.456 --> 00:51:42.541
I need pants. I need pants.

410
00:51:42.791 --> 00:51:44.126
- Jackson.
- Shit.


411
00:51:45.211 --> 00:51:46.712
I got your rain pants in mine.

412
00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:49.298
Who are those guys?

413
00:51:50.132 --> 00:51:50.966
What's going on?

414
00:51:51.217 --> 00:51:52.218
This is bad.

415
00:51:52.593 --> 00:51:53.677
This is my fault.

416
00:51:54.762 --> 00:51:56.388
Why are they shooting at us?

417
00:51:58.974 --> 00:52:01.060
I found a case full
of money yesterday.


418
00:52:02.394 --> 00:52:03.437
You what?

419
00:52:04.438 --> 00:52:07.900
Up in that deer stand
on top of the ridge line.


420
00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.111
There was a dead
guy in a parachute.


421
00:52:11.111 --> 00:52:13.197
In his hand was
a submachine gun,


422
00:52:13.531 --> 00:52:17.701
and at his feet, there
was a case full of money.


423
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.453
Yeah, right.

424
00:52:42.977 --> 00:52:43.978
We gotta get outta here.

425
00:52:45.604 --> 00:52:46.730
I ruined your hunt.

426
00:52:49.024 --> 00:52:50.568
You ruined my hunt?

427
00:52:51.193 --> 00:52:53.320
You saved my life.

428
00:52:54.655 --> 00:52:56.240
I never should
have opened the case.


429
00:52:56.865 --> 00:52:58.284
They wouldn't have chased us.

430
00:53:00.035 --> 00:53:01.745
Just get me outta here alive.

431
00:53:03.581 --> 00:53:04.915
We can split the money.

432
00:53:10.963 --> 00:53:14.008
All right, that's a deal.

433
00:53:17.595 --> 00:53:18.846
What are we gonna do?

434
00:53:21.348 --> 00:53:22.308
Kill 'em.

435
00:53:33.611 --> 00:53:34.320
Go.

436
00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.364
Targets were engaged
but able to escape.


437
00:53:37.364 --> 00:53:38.616
In pursuit now.

438
00:53:38.616 --> 00:53:40.242
Package presumed
to be with them.


439
00:53:40.242 --> 00:53:41.744
What do you mean presumed?

440
00:53:42.161 --> 00:53:43.120
It's with them.

441
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:43.912
We'll get it.

442
00:53:43.912 --> 00:53:46.206
Very good, send
me your coordinates.


443
00:53:46.832 --> 00:53:48.250
I said we'll get it.

444
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.043
It'll be had.

445
00:53:49.043 --> 00:53:50.210
Send me your coordinates.

446
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:52.254
I'm gonna get you
your money back.


447
00:54:19.156 --> 00:54:20.741
There's no out
running dirt bikes.


448
00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:22.534
How good of a shot are you?

449
00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:23.952
What do you mean?

450
00:54:24.411 --> 00:54:25.371
I got a plan.

451
00:54:27.373 --> 00:54:28.332
Come on.

452
00:54:30.959 --> 00:54:33.087
I really hate your plan.

453
00:54:33.087 --> 00:54:35.714
If they stop, I'll
give 'em the bag.


454
00:54:36.131 --> 00:54:38.801
If they don't, you shoot 'em.

455
00:54:39.343 --> 00:54:41.095
What if they just shoot you?

456
00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.056
It's hard to get a clean
shot from a moving bike.


457
00:54:44.056 --> 00:54:45.974
What if they stop
and then shoot you?


458
00:54:46.892 --> 00:54:49.144
Well, let's just hope I
can draw quicker than them.


459
00:55:20.426 --> 00:55:21.427
Drop the bag.

460
00:55:21.427 --> 00:55:22.261
Hands in the air.

461
00:55:30.102 --> 00:55:32.896
You're crazy .

462
00:55:39.403 --> 00:55:40.446
Jackson.

463
00:55:43.824 --> 00:55:45.117
Drop the gun.

464
00:55:45.659 --> 00:55:47.077
Drop the bag.

465
00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.704
Drop that gun.

466
00:55:48.704 --> 00:55:49.872
I'll blow her head off.

467
00:55:49.872 --> 00:55:51.498
Okay, all right, just tell me

468
00:55:51.498 --> 00:55:52.750
what you want me to do first.

469
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:54.001
You heard what I said.

470
00:55:54.001 --> 00:55:55.085
Just do it.

471
00:55:55.252 --> 00:55:57.004
Okay, I'm really
bad at directions.


472
00:55:58.046 --> 00:55:59.506
- Just drop the-
- Look, you got


473
00:55:59.506 --> 00:56:00.883
a gun at my friend's head.

474
00:56:00.883 --> 00:56:03.177
You just tell me what
you want me to do first.


475
00:56:03.177 --> 00:56:03.969
Don't be stupid.

476
00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:05.137
You heard me.

477
00:56:07.765 --> 00:56:09.057
Let's do mine.

478
00:56:10.601 --> 00:56:11.977
Let's do it my way.

479
00:56:14.188 --> 00:56:15.564
You are crazy.

480
00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:23.739
Alpha one to Dina,

481
00:56:23.739 --> 00:56:25.449
target's engaged on North Road.

482
00:56:26.283 --> 00:56:28.118
Permission to engage.

483
00:56:28.869 --> 00:56:32.122
Excellent, kill them
and retrieve the package.


484
00:57:20.504 --> 00:57:21.964
Jackson, on your right.

485
00:57:31.723 --> 00:57:32.683
You okay?

486
00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:35.853
- I'm fine.
- Okay, let's go.


487
00:57:35.853 --> 00:57:37.437
Who are you really?

488
00:57:38.939 --> 00:57:40.858
On your feet, let's go.

489
00:57:57.791 --> 00:57:59.084
Those aren't for this.

490
00:57:59.626 --> 00:58:03.380
Listen, we need to get some
cover and get off this mountain.


491
00:58:04.464 --> 00:58:05.757
Who are you really?

492
00:58:06.717 --> 00:58:09.553
I'm just a hunting guide
trying to get you down safe.


493
00:58:10.888 --> 00:58:12.681
I think you should go
down alone, all right,


494
00:58:12.681 --> 00:58:15.309
no pack, no money, no
reason to bother you.


495
00:58:15.976 --> 00:58:16.977
It'll be safer.

496
00:58:17.269 --> 00:58:20.147
Absolutely not, I'd
die on that trail.


497
00:58:20.772 --> 00:58:21.982
Yeah?

498
00:58:21.982 --> 00:58:23.609
Well, you may die up here.

499
00:58:23.609 --> 00:58:25.152
I am not walking on foot

500
00:58:25.152 --> 00:58:27.779
through grizzly bear-infested
woods while a bunch


501
00:58:27.779 --> 00:58:30.657
of paramilitary guys with
machine guns shoot at me.


502
00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:32.576
I trusted you to
take me up here.


503
00:58:32.576 --> 00:58:34.036
You need to get me out, too.

504
00:58:34.828 --> 00:58:35.996
Who are you?

505
00:58:40.292 --> 00:58:43.879
That is an MDRX
bullpup assault rifle,


506
00:58:43.879 --> 00:58:46.548
suppressed and chambered in 308,

507
00:58:46.965 --> 00:58:48.634
has a multidynamic firing system

508
00:58:48.634 --> 00:58:51.219
between semi-automatic
and fully automatic modes.


509
00:58:51.219 --> 00:58:53.472
It weighs 8.7 pounds.

510
00:58:53.472 --> 00:58:56.016
The firing mechanics are all
located behind the trigger.


511
00:58:56.016 --> 00:58:58.644
The purpose of this
design gives the MDRX


512
00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:01.021
a shorter overall length
than a conventional rifle


513
00:59:01.021 --> 00:59:02.564
of a similar barrel length.

514
00:59:02.564 --> 00:59:04.107
It comes in four main variants,

515
00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:07.945
223, 308, 6.5 Creedmoor,
and 300 Blackout.


516
00:59:07.945 --> 00:59:10.322
This, this is a
custom-made assault rifle


517
00:59:10.322 --> 00:59:12.991
chambered in a NATO 556 round.

518
00:59:12.991 --> 00:59:15.911
These guys, these guys are pros.

519
00:59:18.997 --> 00:59:21.041
I was a Navy Seal
for most of my life.


520
00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:23.502
We stepped into
something really bad.


521
00:59:25.504 --> 00:59:29.591
80, military operatives
are trying to kill us?


522
00:59:30.759 --> 00:59:32.552
They probably
just want the money.


523
00:59:34.429 --> 00:59:36.223
What if they don't
just want the money?


524
00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.849
What if they wanna kill you

525
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:39.518
because you know
about the money?


526
00:59:39.518 --> 00:59:42.980
We, we know about the money.

527
00:59:45.023 --> 00:59:46.191
So, what do you say?

528
00:59:46.608 --> 00:59:47.609
I'll get you on that trail.

529
00:59:47.609 --> 00:59:48.694
You can go down alone.

530
00:59:48.694 --> 00:59:50.112
It'll be safer for you.

531
00:59:50.112 --> 00:59:51.530
You're not hearing me.

532
00:59:51.947 --> 00:59:53.240
Trust me.

533
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.533
I need you.

534
00:59:55.659 --> 00:59:56.702
Please.

535
00:59:57.452 --> 00:59:58.787
I don't do that.

536
00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:00.831
What?

537
01:00:01.873 --> 01:00:03.125
Trust.

538
01:00:07.212 --> 01:00:09.798
If, if I'm going down the
mountain, it's with you.


539
01:00:09.798 --> 01:00:11.800
If I'm gonna die,
it's not gonna be


540
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.594
at the hands of some
gunman or a bear.


541
01:00:17.139 --> 01:00:18.890
I'm staying with you.

542
01:00:22.436 --> 01:00:23.603
Okay.

543
01:00:24.438 --> 01:00:25.605
I'm your guide.

544
01:00:25.605 --> 01:00:27.274
I'll get you out of this alive.

545
01:00:43.331 --> 01:00:44.416
Let's go.

546
01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.335
This isn't the
way we came, is it?


547
01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:50.672
Nope, it's a back way.

548
01:00:50.672 --> 01:00:52.716
I'm hoping not to
run into anyone.


549
01:00:54.593 --> 01:00:56.219
Hate to burst your bubble.

550
01:00:59.347 --> 01:01:00.640
Go, go, go.

551
01:01:24.372 --> 01:01:25.415
We're trapped.

552
01:01:28.043 --> 01:01:29.252
We should go back.

553
01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:30.587
No, no.

554
01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.130
We can ascend it.

555
01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:33.215
What?

556
01:01:33.215 --> 01:01:34.424
I can climb it.

557
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.551
You're gonna rock-climb it

558
01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:38.845
with an automatic weapon
strapped to you and a backpack?


559
01:01:38.845 --> 01:01:41.139
No, that would be ridiculous.

560
01:01:41.139 --> 01:01:42.265
Then what?

561
01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:44.142
You're gonna have the pack.

562
01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:46.812
I'm gonna go up, and
I'll bring you up.


563
01:01:47.145 --> 01:01:48.146
If we can gain

564
01:01:48.146 --> 01:01:51.566
the knife-blade ridge, we can
get to the truck really fast,


565
01:01:52.025 --> 01:01:53.443
long as nobody falls.

566
01:01:53.902 --> 01:01:54.945
And that sounds better?

567
01:01:58.156 --> 01:01:59.491
I don't like this.

568
01:02:00.492 --> 01:02:01.660
What is it?

569
01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:08.416
If you can't see the
target, you become the target.


570
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:13.255
We're being hunted.

571
01:02:19.219 --> 01:02:20.762
We gotta get up this wall.

572
01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.286
'Kay.

573
01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:47.581
When the rope goes tight,
it means you're on belay.


574
01:02:47.581 --> 01:02:48.874
What does that mean?

575
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:52.127
When the rope goes tight,
you start climbing up.


576
01:02:52.878 --> 01:02:54.171
And if I fall, I'm safe?

577
01:02:54.796 --> 01:02:56.506
I'm only giving
you a hip belay.


578
01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:58.091
Don't fall.

579
01:03:43.929 --> 01:03:46.848
Drop the pack and put
your hands in the air.


580
01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:57.692
Watch the rope.

581
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:29.516
- Ow.

582
01:04:52.831 --> 01:04:54.291
Jackson, pull me up.

583
01:05:03.008 --> 01:05:04.092
- Oh, shit.
- That's it.


584
01:05:04.092 --> 01:05:04.718
Keep coming.

585
01:05:04.718 --> 01:05:06.177
- I've got you.

586
01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:07.887
Did you get hit?

587
01:05:07.887 --> 01:05:09.180
I think it grazed me.

588
01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.056
You're gonna sit down.

589
01:05:10.056 --> 01:05:10.974
Hold on.

590
01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:16.521
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?


591
01:05:16.521 --> 01:05:17.397
I told you.

592
01:05:17.397 --> 01:05:18.648
I'm full of surprises.

593
01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:19.941
Okay.

594
01:05:22.861 --> 01:05:23.820
My dad wanted a boy,

595
01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.864
so he made me take
mixed martial arts.


596
01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:29.868
Look, I don't think you got
a direct hit on that guy.


597
01:05:29.868 --> 01:05:30.952
Yeah.

598
01:05:30.952 --> 01:05:32.162
How's your leg?

599
01:05:32.537 --> 01:05:33.621
It hurts.

600
01:05:33.955 --> 01:05:35.457
All right, let
me have the pack.


601
01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:38.501
You don't trust me?

602
01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:42.047
Look, I need to get
a look at the leg.


603
01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:45.759
Here.

604
01:05:48.386 --> 01:05:49.179
Here.

605
01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:51.848
Try it this way.

606
01:05:59.647 --> 01:06:01.149
How's it look?

607
01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.425
How's it look?

608
01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.431
It just grazed you.

609
01:06:37.977 --> 01:06:39.104
Let me have the pack.

610
01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:41.398
The pack?

611
01:06:42.607 --> 01:06:43.983
Yeah.

612
01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:46.486
There's a first aid
kit in the pack.


613
01:06:55.328 --> 01:06:56.788
We gotta stash the case.

614
01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:03.169
You wanna hide a case
full of money in the woods


615
01:07:03.169 --> 01:07:04.879
after everything
we've been through?


616
01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:07.841
Look, you're hit.

617
01:07:07.841 --> 01:07:10.760
This case, it's just
gonna slow us down.


618
01:07:11.386 --> 01:07:14.514
We stand a much better
chance of surviving


619
01:07:15.223 --> 01:07:16.641
if it's not on us.

620
01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:17.892
I'm not hit.

621
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.727
It grazed me.

622
01:07:27.569 --> 01:07:28.903
You trust me?

623
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:31.197
I trust you.

624
01:07:33.658 --> 01:07:34.409
Good.

625
01:07:38.663 --> 01:07:39.956
I know just the place.

626
01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:43.501
Come on.

627
01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.055
Watch your step.

628
01:07:56.181 --> 01:07:57.515
What's your plan?

629
01:07:58.099 --> 01:08:00.143
We're gonna hide
the case in that tree.


630
01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:01.019
What?

631
01:08:01.394 --> 01:08:02.479
You'“ see.

632
01:08:11.446 --> 01:08:12.447
Okay.

633
01:08:14.741 --> 01:08:15.950
Hold this.

634
01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:18.495
Okay.

635
01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:19.954
I'm gonna go up the tree.

636
01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:24.292
I'm gonna drop this
rope down to the bottom.


637
01:08:24.292 --> 01:08:25.835
You're gonna tie it to the case.

638
01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.087
I'm gonna pull it up, 'kay?

639
01:08:28.087 --> 01:08:29.672
- You watch.
- Really?


640
01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:31.382
Yeah, it's gonna work.

641
01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:32.509
All right.

642
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:49.859
Rope's coming down.

643
01:08:52.946 --> 01:08:53.780
You got it?

644
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.405
Yeah.

645
01:08:54.405 --> 01:08:56.241
Okay, tie it to the pack.

646
01:09:02.163 --> 01:09:02.997
You good?

647
01:09:02.997 --> 01:09:04.040
Yeah.

648
01:09:07.835 --> 01:09:09.128
All right,
I'm gonna pull it up.


649
01:09:09.128 --> 01:09:09.879
Okay.

650
01:09:16.594 --> 01:09:17.428
It worked.

651
01:09:17.971 --> 01:09:18.930
Genius.

652
01:09:29.607 --> 01:09:31.276
Think we'll see that case again?

653
01:09:32.193 --> 01:09:33.278
I hope so.

654
01:09:33.653 --> 01:09:35.196
All right, the sun's going down.

655
01:09:35.947 --> 01:09:37.991
We're a couple
miles from my truck.


656
01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.077
All right, let's go.

657
01:09:57.844 --> 01:09:59.345
What are you doing?

658
01:09:59.345 --> 01:10:01.347
I'm gonna throw the
pack in the river.


659
01:10:01.347 --> 01:10:02.932
That way, if they find it,

660
01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:05.476
it's far away from
us and the money.


661
01:10:07.186 --> 01:10:08.146
You okay?

662
01:10:08.146 --> 01:10:09.606
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You cold?


663
01:10:09.606 --> 01:10:10.148
I'm fine.

664
01:10:10.148 --> 01:10:11.316
All right, we
gotta keep moving.


665
01:10:11.316 --> 01:10:12.358
Let's go.

666
01:10:44.307 --> 01:10:47.101
- That's one heck of a view.

667
01:10:54.567 --> 01:10:56.402
These guys are like
the freaking plague.


668
01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:05.244
- Come on, come on. Keep up.

669
01:11:11.584 --> 01:11:12.835
Come on, keep up.

670
01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:15.838
Easy for you to
say, Mr. Navy Seal.


671
01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.423
I don't usually
spent my time running


672
01:11:17.423 --> 01:11:20.843
around the mountain at altitude
being chased by a maniac.


673
01:11:23.137 --> 01:11:26.307
Yeah, well, now you know
what feels like to be an elk.


674
01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:27.767
So, next time I
take you hunting,


675
01:11:27.767 --> 01:11:29.519
you'll have new insight
into how to stalk a bull,


676
01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.062
and you'll be able
to get yourself one.


677
01:11:31.396 --> 01:11:33.231
Assuming there is a next hunt.

678
01:11:34.607 --> 01:11:35.775
I got one more
trick on my sleeve.


679
01:11:35.775 --> 01:11:36.943
Come on.

680
01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:57.964
This is your plan,
getting us killed?


681
01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:00.049
No way, I don't do water.

682
01:12:00.591 --> 01:12:02.009
You should just kill them.

683
01:12:02.135 --> 01:12:03.094
Yeah?

684
01:12:03.094 --> 01:12:06.264
Do you wanna stay here and
die, or do you wanna live?


685
01:12:28.327 --> 01:12:29.704
Okay, there's a rapid ahead.

686
01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.546
Stay on me.

687
01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:49.182
Here we go.

688
01:12:52.143 --> 01:12:53.436
Stay calm.

689
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.326
Hold your breath.

690
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.723
Jackson, Jackson.

691
01:13:32.558 --> 01:13:34.268
Jackson, where are you?

692
01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:44.070
They're in the
river, headed down.


693
01:13:44.111 --> 01:13:45.196
Fan out.

694
01:13:45.196 --> 01:13:47.156
Search the banks and any
possible egress points.


695
01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.081
Jackson.

696
01:13:58.334 --> 01:13:59.669
Jackson.

697
01:14:01.796 --> 01:14:02.839
Jackson.

698
01:14:08.719 --> 01:14:09.846
You okay?

699
01:14:10.763 --> 01:14:11.848
Great.

700
01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.307
Never been better.

701
01:14:14.559 --> 01:14:16.018
At
least you're alive.


702
01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.228
Look on the bright side.

703
01:14:17.228 --> 01:14:20.064
Most tourists pay hundreds of
dollars to float that river.


704
01:14:20.064 --> 01:14:21.399
You got it for free.

705
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.736
Most tourists do it in a
raft and don't almost die.


706
01:14:25.736 --> 01:14:27.697
Yeah, well, I never
said I was a rafting guy.


707
01:14:27.864 --> 01:14:29.407
Now, listen, we
gotta get outta here.


708
01:14:29.407 --> 01:14:31.868
We bought us some
time but not a lot.


709
01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:32.785
Let's go.

710
01:14:52.263 --> 01:14:54.473
Jackson, it's so cold.

711
01:14:54.473 --> 01:14:55.558
I know. Come on.

712
01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:56.642
We gotta get outta here.

713
01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:57.560
We're almost there.

714
01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.561
Keep moving.

715
01:14:58.561 --> 01:14:59.770
Come on.

716
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:01.272
Don't quit. Come on.

717
01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.493
Okay, okay.

718
01:15:14.785 --> 01:15:15.912
What's the plan?

719
01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:17.705
We're gonna take this
road back to the trail head,


720
01:15:17.955 --> 01:15:19.790
and my truck, it's
about four miles.


721
01:15:20.374 --> 01:15:21.208
Four miles?

722
01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:23.544
Yep, yep, we're gonna
move fast on this road,


723
01:15:23.544 --> 01:15:24.378
get back to my truck.

724
01:15:24.378 --> 01:15:25.838
I got some toys
that'll even the odds.


725
01:15:29.467 --> 01:15:30.927
Well, I'll be.

726
01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:32.970
Guess we won't have to
walk all the way after all.


727
01:15:33.554 --> 01:15:34.555
Come on.

728
01:15:40.227 --> 01:15:41.312
You good?

729
01:15:41.312 --> 01:15:42.396
It's a friend of mine.

730
01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:04.627
Jackson, what are you
doing way the fuck out here?


731
01:16:05.419 --> 01:16:06.379
Was on a hunt.

732
01:16:06.379 --> 01:16:08.881
Uh, our horses got spooked
and left us on foot.


733
01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:10.007
We were walking
back to my truck.


734
01:16:10.007 --> 01:16:12.468
Do you think we could,
uh, catch a ride?


735
01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:15.304
Yeah, my passenger's
seat had that fire, though.


736
01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:16.180
Jump in the back.

737
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:16.973
There's plenty of room.

738
01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:18.933
Murph, this is
Kate, my client.


739
01:16:18.933 --> 01:16:20.726
What are you doing
with a roughneck like him


740
01:16:20.726 --> 01:16:22.144
way the fuck out here, sweetie?

741
01:16:22.937 --> 01:16:24.188
He's not so bad.

742
01:16:24.605 --> 01:16:25.189
All right, come on.

743
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:26.148
Jump in the back.

744
01:16:34.907 --> 01:16:36.242
Get up and in the back, sweetie.

745
01:16:36.242 --> 01:16:37.618
Get up and in there
with your boyfriend.


746
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.286
Get up. Get in.

747
01:16:40.121 --> 01:16:41.414
Lemme see your hands.

748
01:16:41.414 --> 01:16:42.873
Get up and in there. Lay down.

749
01:16:57.221 --> 01:16:58.222
Jackson.

750
01:16:59.473 --> 01:17:04.020
Jackson, Jackson.

751
01:17:05.146 --> 01:17:06.230
Jackson.

752
01:17:10.234 --> 01:17:14.613
Oh, here's the
cute couple, huh?


753
01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:16.741
How you doing, honey?

754
01:17:16.741 --> 01:17:17.867
You gonna tell Uncle Murph

755
01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:19.869
where that money is now?

756
01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:21.662
Don't touch me.

757
01:17:22.663 --> 01:17:25.458
I told you I don't know
where Jackson put the money.


758
01:17:25.458 --> 01:17:26.208
Huh?

759
01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:29.837
Come on, tell Uncle
Murph where the money is.


760
01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:31.839
I just came up
here to go hunting


761
01:17:31.839 --> 01:17:33.632
and spread my father's ashes.

762
01:17:34.091 --> 01:17:37.386
Oh, were you
daddy's little girl?


763
01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:38.888
Where's the money?

764
01:17:40.473 --> 01:17:41.932
Where's the money?

765
01:17:41.932 --> 01:17:43.225
Eat shit.

766
01:17:43.476 --> 01:17:45.227
Oh, honey, I need a yard

767
01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.063
of your shit to
kiss your asshole.


768
01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:48.189
Where's the fucking money?

769
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:49.940
I told you I don't know.

770
01:17:50.357 --> 01:17:52.109
You lizard-brained bitch.

771
01:17:52.109 --> 01:17:54.236
You're gonna to tell
me sooner or later.


772
01:17:55.196 --> 01:17:55.946
No.

773
01:17:56.447 --> 01:17:58.282
Oh, look who's waking up?

774
01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.910
Oh, Jackson.

775
01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:03.996
Look who's waking up?

776
01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:08.042
Jackson, Jackson, come on.

777
01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:09.085
Wake up now.

778
01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:10.920
Time to talk to Uncle Murph.

779
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.589
Hey, Jackson, come on.

780
01:18:13.589 --> 01:18:14.215
Wake up.

781
01:18:14.215 --> 01:18:16.258
Time to talk to
Uncle Murph, buddy.


782
01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.384
Come on.

783
01:18:17.384 --> 01:18:18.803
Come on, Jackson.

784
01:18:18.803 --> 01:18:21.722
We're gonna go have
a nice talk now.


785
01:18:26.393 --> 01:18:27.561
Oh, Jackson.

786
01:18:29.146 --> 01:18:32.149
Time to wake up, Jackson.

787
01:18:32.858 --> 01:18:33.692
Hey, Jackson.

788
01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.570
Jackson, wake the fuck up.

789
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:39.448
Where's the fucking
money, Jackson?


790
01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:40.658
Where's the fucking money?

791
01:18:43.994 --> 01:18:46.539
You know, Jackson, I never
thought that this would be


792
01:18:46.539 --> 01:18:48.541
where I'm coming
outta retirement.


793
01:18:48.541 --> 01:18:51.085
I always thought a couple months
you'd come looking for me,


794
01:18:51.085 --> 01:18:53.129
and I'd have to
pick up the tools


795
01:18:53.129 --> 01:18:54.713
just to tie up some loose ends.

796
01:18:54.713 --> 01:18:56.632
I never really thought
that I'd be coming


797
01:18:56.632 --> 01:18:58.342
around here chasing you.

798
01:18:58.342 --> 01:19:00.302
Ain't life a fucking bitch?

799
01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:03.055
Now, where's the
fucking money, Jackson?


800
01:19:03.055 --> 01:19:04.598
Where's the girl?

801
01:19:05.182 --> 01:19:07.768
I've already questioned
her, and she didn't come


802
01:19:07.768 --> 01:19:09.478
across with anything whatsoever.

803
01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.772
That's the only reason
you're still alive.


804
01:19:11.772 --> 01:19:13.941
Where is the
motherfucking money?


805
01:19:14.942 --> 01:19:18.863
You know, it's been a while,
but it's like riding a bike.


806
01:19:19.697 --> 01:19:22.158
I'll just pick it right
up where I left off.


807
01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:24.869
Where is the fucking money?

808
01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:28.205
Where is the fucking money?

809
01:19:28.205 --> 01:19:30.624
Oh, I'm sure you still know
how to do your job, Murph.


810
01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:34.420
Those skills, once
you learn 'em,


811
01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.672
they're kinda hard to forget.

812
01:19:37.047 --> 01:19:39.967
Believe me, I tried.

813
01:19:40.467 --> 01:19:41.802
Never saw it coming.

814
01:19:41.802 --> 01:19:43.637
Well, you know, I had to
do a little role-playing


815
01:19:43.637 --> 01:19:46.098
out here in the
country, you know?


816
01:19:46.098 --> 01:19:48.058
I mean, I really did.

817
01:19:48.392 --> 01:19:50.186
I really liked it, too.

818
01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:52.188
You know, I shoulda
been an actor.


819
01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:55.149
That pilot, Nate, he
was a friend of mine.


820
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:57.109
I was supposed to pick
him up at the border.


821
01:19:57.943 --> 01:20:01.322
What'd you do, take a sack
of money off a dead guy,


822
01:20:01.322 --> 01:20:02.615
you sick fuck?

823
01:20:03.824 --> 01:20:07.077
Ah, I would a done the same
fucking thing, Jackson.


824
01:20:07.077 --> 01:20:08.245
Don't get me wrong.

825
01:20:08.245 --> 01:20:10.039
I like you and the
people out here.


826
01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:14.418
I also like $100 million,
and some Mai Tais,


827
01:20:14.418 --> 01:20:16.587
and some strippers
on the beach, huh?


828
01:20:16.587 --> 01:20:18.005
That would be nice.

829
01:20:18.005 --> 01:20:19.965
I know what you mean, Murph.

830
01:20:22.301 --> 01:20:23.802
So, how's this
gonna go Murph, huh?


831
01:20:25.346 --> 01:20:28.265
You gonna torture
me, make me talk?


832
01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.935
Yeah, something
just like that.


833
01:20:31.268 --> 01:20:34.230
But you know, we could
save all that mess.


834
01:20:34.855 --> 01:20:38.692
All you gotta do is tell me
where the fucking money is.


835
01:20:38.692 --> 01:20:40.486
That's all, and then it'll end

836
01:20:40.486 --> 01:20:42.404
a little differently, all right?

837
01:20:44.281 --> 01:20:45.824
Tell you what, Murph.

838
01:20:48.327 --> 01:20:50.537
This life's kicked my ass.

839
01:20:52.331 --> 01:20:53.874
My daughter dies.

840
01:20:53.874 --> 01:20:55.501
My wife cheats on me.

841
01:20:56.293 --> 01:20:59.088
Got  more bills
than I got fucking money.


842
01:21:00.798 --> 01:21:03.133
My body's old and broken.

843
01:21:04.635 --> 01:21:06.512
Oh, poor Jackson.

844
01:21:06.512 --> 01:21:10.599
You're really gonna make me
lose some sleep over your life?


845
01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:11.684
Come on.

846
01:21:12.518 --> 01:21:14.979
I need to know where
that fucking money is.


847
01:21:15.312 --> 01:21:17.982
Are we seeing eye
to eye, big boy?


848
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:21.151
But ain't muscle memory
a funny thing, Murph?


849
01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:24.738
Yeah, muscle memory.

850
01:21:25.072 --> 01:21:26.282
You know when you do something,

851
01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:28.659
no matter how long it's
been since you done it,


852
01:21:29.243 --> 01:21:31.412
the body remembers how to do it.

853
01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:37.251
Yeah, you know, like take, uh,
picking a lock for example.


854
01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:38.919
What?

855
01:21:44.341 --> 01:21:46.093
Now, we see eye to eye, Murph.

856
01:21:59.898 --> 01:22:00.899
Kate?

857
01:22:05.779 --> 01:22:07.114
Kate.

858
01:22:25.466 --> 01:22:26.425
Kate.

859
01:22:49.323 --> 01:22:50.282
Kate.

860
01:22:50.282 --> 01:22:52.034
Oh, my God.

861
01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:53.243
Are you okay?

862
01:22:53.243 --> 01:22:54.328
Fine.

863
01:22:54.912 --> 01:22:56.705
You have some
interesting friends.


864
01:22:56.997 --> 01:22:58.499
Murph is a real asshole.

865
01:22:59.249 --> 01:23:01.001
Yeah, I know.

866
01:23:01.001 --> 01:23:02.211
We gotta get outta here.

867
01:23:11.178 --> 01:23:12.096
We've been followed.

868
01:23:12.805 --> 01:23:13.931
It's him, isn't it?

869
01:23:14.807 --> 01:23:16.600
- Yeah.

870
01:23:16.767 --> 01:23:17.684
Later.

871
01:23:18.394 --> 01:23:19.728
- Shit.
- Come on.


872
01:23:50.551 --> 01:23:51.385
Run.

873
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:26.086
It's just me and
you now, frog man,


874
01:24:26.086 --> 01:24:28.130
and I eat seals for breakfast.

875
01:24:57.326 --> 01:25:00.329
Looks like that's the end
of your little girlfriend.


876
01:25:00.454 --> 01:25:01.371
You're next.

877
01:25:54.007 --> 01:25:55.300
Are you okay?

878
01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:02.266
Yeah, never better.

879
01:26:06.603 --> 01:26:07.646
Are you?

880
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:10.190
Same.

881
01:26:11.817 --> 01:26:14.611
Are all your hunting
trips this much fun?


882
01:26:16.113 --> 01:26:18.532
Yeah, all of 'em.

883
01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:25.330
Sometimes you get to play
the hunter, not the hunted.


884
01:26:31.169 --> 01:26:33.463
What do you say we
get some clothes on,


885
01:26:34.506 --> 01:26:36.008
go get that money?

886
01:26:39.595 --> 01:26:41.555
And my father's ashes.

887
01:27:44.534 --> 01:27:45.827
Should we open it?

888
01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:48.163
Yeah.

889
01:28:00.467 --> 01:28:02.386
That is a ton of cash.

890
01:28:03.804 --> 01:28:05.138
Just one more thing.

891
01:28:09.726 --> 01:28:12.771
Well, I guess you'll never
forget your first hunt, huh?


892
01:28:14.147 --> 01:28:15.357
It's not over yet.

893
01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:22.739
Ain't it funny, though?

894
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:30.247
You did all those martial
arts, you know, for your dad,


895
01:28:31.456 --> 01:28:33.083
learned how to shoot a gun,

896
01:28:35.127 --> 01:28:37.003
but you never went
hunting with him.


897
01:29:02.404 --> 01:29:04.740
Why? Why?

898
01:29:08.326 --> 01:29:09.286
Why?

899
01:29:26.678 --> 01:29:27.596
Why?

900
01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:32.392
I recruited you
to kill my enemies.


901
01:29:32.851 --> 01:29:33.643
What?

902
01:29:36.521 --> 01:29:38.064
You're a pawn.

903
01:29:42.569 --> 01:29:43.904
I saved you.

904
01:29:47.824 --> 01:29:52.412
You did exactly what
we knew you would do.


905
01:29:59.252 --> 01:30:00.712
I trusted you.

906
01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:58.723
Dina, is it done?

907
01:32:59.432 --> 01:33:00.767
She escaped.

908
01:33:01.434 --> 01:33:03.478
I'm gonna kill that bitch.
