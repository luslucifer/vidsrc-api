00:00:07.218 --> 00:00:09.155
Hello? Hello? Radio Tower?

2
00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:13.876
Lisbon plane taking off
in 10 minutes. East runway. Thank you.


3
00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:28.966
Louis, have your man go with Mr Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.


4
00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:31.051
Certainly, Rick. 
Anything you say.

5
00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:33.345
Find Mr Laszlo's luggage
and put it on the plane.


6
00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:34.439
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:35.891
This way, please.

8
00:00:37.622 --> 00:00:40.093
If you don't mind, you fill in the names.
That'll make it even more official.


9
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:41.949
You think of everything, don't you?

10
00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:45.692
And the names are
Mr and Mrs Victor Laszlo.


11
00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:49.248
- But... why my name, Richard?
- 'Cause you're getting on that plane.


12
00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:52.897
- I don't understand. What about you?
- I'm staying here with him till the plane gets safely away.


13
00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:55.658
- No, Richard! No, what's happened to you?
Last night you said...


14
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.201
Last night we said a great many things.

15
00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:59.205
You said I was to do the
thinking for both of us.


16
00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:02.102
Well, I've done a lot of it since then and
it all adds up to one thing:


17
00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:03.958
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.


18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.504
- But Rick, no I, I...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.


19
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.974
You have any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?


20
00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:14.071
9 chances out of 10 we'd both wind up in a
concentration camp, isn't that true Louis?


21
00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.923
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

22
00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:19.328
You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.


23
00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.881
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.


24
00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:24.018
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.


25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.263
If that plane leaves the ground
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.


26
00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:31.163
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon for the rest of your life.


27
00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:33.738
But what about us?

28
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:35.490
We'll always have Paris.

29
00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:38.889
We didn't have we... we'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.


30
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.326
We got it back last night.

31
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.603
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.


32
00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.303
Look I'm no good at being noble.

33
00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:50.283
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...


34
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:53.636
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.


35
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.715
Someday you'll understand that.

36
00:01:57.698 --> 00:01:59.970
Now, now.

37
00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:03.597
Here's looking at you, kid.

38
00:02:16.028 --> 00:02:18.237
There's something you should
know before you leave.


39
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.426
- Mr. Blaine, I don't ask
you to explain anything.


40
00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:23.387
I'm going to anyway because it may make
a difference to you later on.


41
00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.911
You said you know about Ilsa and me.
- Yes.


42
00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.872
She didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.


43
00:02:28.874 --> 00:02:32.106
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?


44
00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:33.877
Yes.

45
00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.694
She tried everything to get them
but nothing worked.


46
00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:40.135
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.


47
00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:42.927
But that was all over long ago.

48
00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:47.022
For your sake she pretended it wasn't
and I let her pretend.


49
00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:49.734
- I understand.
- Here it is.


50
00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:51.852
Thanks.

51
00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:06.783
Are you ready, Ilsa?

52
00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:10.793
Yes, I'm ready.

53
00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.417
Bye, Rick.

54
00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.758
God bless you.

55
00:03:18.554 --> 00:03:21.306
You better hurry,
you'll miss that plane.


56
00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:54.892
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.


57
00:03:54.894 --> 00:03:59.636
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville.
I could be induced to arrange a passage.


58
00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:02.805
My letter of transit? 
I could use a trip.

59
00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:06.311
It doesn't make a difference about our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 Francs.


60
00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:09.594
Ah that 10,000 Francs
should pay our expenses.


61
00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:11.627
"Our" expenses?
- Uh huh.


62
00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.565
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.


63
00:04:59.109 --> 00:05:02.560
Who am I kidding? 
I'm not like that.

64
00:05:02.612 --> 00:05:05.317
I never was, I never will be.

65
00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.115
That's strictly the movies.

66
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.196
I'm so depressed.

67
00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:18.496
Maybe if I took
two more aspirin it would help.


68
00:05:18.544 --> 00:05:22.755
That would make...
two, four, six aspirin.


69
00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:26.290
I'm turning into an aspirin junkie.

70
00:05:26.343 --> 00:05:31.088
Soon I'll be boiling the cotton
at the top of the bottle to get the extra.


71
00:05:40.732 --> 00:05:43.020
I shouldn't have signed those papers.

72
00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.273
Let her take me to court.

73
00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.237
Two years of marriage down the drain.

74
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.950
I couldn't believe what she said to me.

75
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:54.194
She was like a total stranger,
not like my wife.


76
00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:57.696
I don't want any alimony.
I just want out.


77
00:05:57.748 --> 00:06:01.580
- Can't we discuss it?
- We discussed it 50 times.


78
00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:04.082
- Why?
- I don't know.


79
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.205
I can't stand the marriage.

80
00:06:06.256 --> 00:06:08.462
You're no fun, you suffocate me.

81
00:06:08.508 --> 00:06:11.794
There's no rapport
and I don't dig you physically.


82
00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:15.130
For God's sake, Allan,
don't take it personal.


83
00:06:15.181 --> 00:06:18.632
I won't take it personal,
I'll just kill myself.


84
00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:22.934
If only I knew where my analyst
was vacationing.


85
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.274
Where do they go every August?
They leave the city.


86
00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:31.529
Every summer the city is full of people
who are crazy till Labour Day.


87
00:06:31.572 --> 00:06:34.656
What if I reach him?
What's he gonna tell me?


88
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.069
Whatever I say
he tells me it's a sexual problem.


89
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.489
Isn't that ridiculous?
How can it be sexual?


90
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.161
We weren't even having relations.

91
00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:46.285
Maybe once in a while.

92
00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:48.827
She used to watch TV during it.

93
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.165
Change channels
with the remote control.


94
00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:55.301
Why should a divorce bother me so?

95
00:06:55.344 --> 00:06:57.882
Maybe I'm better off without her.

96
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.014
Why not?
I'm young, healthy, got a good job.


97
00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:04.344
This could be my chance
to step out a little bit.


98
00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:06.471
If she can swing, so can l.

99
00:07:06.522 --> 00:07:08.929
I could turn this place into a nightclub.

100
00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:11.983
Get broads here
like you wouldn't believe.


101
00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:14.565
Swingers, freaks, nymphomaniacs,

102
00:07:14.613 --> 00:07:16.938
dental hygienists.

103
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.944
If she didn't want me,
I won't push myself on her.


104
00:07:19.993 --> 00:07:23.278
I couldn't believe
what she said when she left.


105
00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:25.203
I want a new life.

106
00:07:25.248 --> 00:07:28.035
I want to go skiing,
go dancing, go to the beach,


107
00:07:28.084 --> 00:07:30.622
ride through Europe on a motorcycle.

108
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.873
- All we ever do is see movies.
- I write for a film magazine.


109
00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:35.999
Besides, I happen to like movies.

110
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.798
That's because
you're one of life's great watchers.


111
00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:44.554
I'm a doer. I want to participate.
We never laugh together.


112
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.432
How can you say that?
I'm constantly laughing.


113
00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:53.603
I chuckle, I giggle, I guffaw. Why didn't
this come up when we were dating?


114
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.975
You were more aggressive then.

115
00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:59.361
Everybody is during courtship.
It's natural.


116
00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:04.482
You can't expect me to keep up that
level of charm, I'd have a heart attack.


117
00:08:04.535 --> 00:08:07.109
Goodbye, Allan.

118
00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:09.321
My lawyer will call your lawyer.

119
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.867
I don't have a lawyer.

120
00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:14.994
Have him call my doctor.

121
00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:23.252
What's the matter with me?
Why can't I be cool?


122
00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:25.759
What's the secret?

123
00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:30.266
There's no secret, kid.
Dames are simple.


124
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.557
I never met one that didn't understand
a slap in the mouth


125
00:08:34.606 --> 00:08:36.978
or a slug from a .45.

126
00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:39.148
Yeah, cos you're Bogart.

127
00:08:39.193 --> 00:08:42.693
I could never hit Nancy.
It's not that type of relationship.


128
00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:45.988
Where'd you learn that word,
the shrink?


129
00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:50.991
I'm not like you. In Casablanca, when
you lost lngrid, weren't you crushed?


130
00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:53.743
Nothing a little bourbon and soda
wouldn't fix.


131
00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:56.957
I can't drink.
My body won't tolerate alcohol.


132
00:08:57.002 --> 00:09:01.379
Take my advice and forget
all this fancy relationship stuff.


133
00:09:01.423 --> 00:09:03.665
The world is full of dames.

134
00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:06.208
All you got to do is whistle.

135
00:09:12.768 --> 00:09:14.642
He's right.

136
00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:17.557
You give them an inch
and they step all over you.


137
00:09:18.107 --> 00:09:20.977
Why can't I develop that attitude?

138
00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:24.810
Nothing a little bourbon and soda
couldn't fix.


139
00:09:54.016 --> 00:09:56.304
- Are you all right?
- You poor thing!


140
00:09:56.351 --> 00:09:59.388
- Why didn't you call us?
- I didn't want to bother you.


141
00:09:59.438 --> 00:10:03.186
Not bother us?
For God's sake, what are friends for?


142
00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:05.605
Why did she say
she wanted a divorce?


143
00:10:05.652 --> 00:10:07.810
She doesn't laugh enough.

144
00:10:07.862 --> 00:10:10.816
Insufficient laughter -
grounds for divorce.


145
00:10:10.865 --> 00:10:12.941
She wants to go skiing.

146
00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:15.483
She wants to ski
down a mountain laughing.


147
00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:19.700
Let me call my office.
I ran out of a meeting when you called.


148
00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:22.037
They must think I'm crazy.

149
00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:25.619
- Have you heard from her?
- I heard from Schulman and Weiss.


150
00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:28.837
I signed some papers
and Nancy went to Mexico.


151
00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:31.041
We went there on our honeymoon.

152
00:10:31.093 --> 00:10:33.631
Spent the entire two weeks in bed.

153
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.754
I had dysentery.

154
00:10:35.806 --> 00:10:39.388
Hello, George?
Did they agree to the terms?


155
00:10:40.435 --> 00:10:43.970
Oh, hell. Well, if we
blow it, we blow it.

156
00:10:44.022 --> 00:10:47.058
God! Can't you cook anything
but TV dinners?


157
00:10:47.108 --> 00:10:50.643
Who bothers to cook them?
I suck them frozen.


158
00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:56.982
I'll tell you where you can reach me,
I'll be at 362-9296 for a while.


159
00:10:57.034 --> 00:11:01.862
Then I'll be at 648-0024
for about 15 minutes.


160
00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:05.117
Then I'll be at 752-0420

161
00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:08.084
and then I'll be home at 621 -4598.

162
00:11:08.837 --> 00:11:10.711
Right, George. Bye-bye.

163
00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:14.800
There's a phone booth on the corner,
shall I get the number?


164
00:11:14.843 --> 00:11:17.298
You'll be passing it.

165
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.716
- I'm sorry, Allan.
- She wants to be a swinger.


166
00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:26.467
- Married life is no good for her.
- Don't get worked up.


167
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:29.308
I gave her a home, affection, security.

168
00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:33.188
This was a girl I found
waiting on tables at the Hip Bagel.


169
00:11:33.235 --> 00:11:36.106
I used to go there every night
and over-tip her.


170
00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:38.443
$1 .50 on a 35-cent check.

171
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.160
Nancy was impulsive.
We all knew that.


172
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:45.530
She didn't leave impulsively.
She talked about it for months.


173
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.530
- I didn't believe she'd do it.
- It's good you find out now.


174
00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.953
- You're young. Make a new life.
- I'm 29.


175
00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:56.587
The height of my sexual potency
was ten years ago.


176
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.550
Look at the bright side. You're free.

177
00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.670
You'll go out, there'll be girls.

178
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.006
You'll go to parties,
have affairs with married women.


179
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:09.185
Sexual relations with girls
of every race, creed and colour.


180
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.643
You get tired of that.

181
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.774
Besides, those kinds of things
never happen to me.


182
00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:19.732
I managed to fool one girl into
loving me and now she's gone.


183
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.938
See how he downgrades himself?

184
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.940
Don't you think plenty of women
would find him attractive?


185
00:12:25.994 --> 00:12:30.157
- Yes, of course.
- The world's full of eligible women.


186
00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:33.492
Yeah, but not like Nancy.
She was a lovely thing.


187
00:12:33.543 --> 00:12:36.081
I used to lay in bed
and watch her sleep.


188
00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:38.666
Once in a while she'd wake up
and catch me.


189
00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.790
She'd let out a scream.

190
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.008
He really loved her. 
I feel like crying.

191
00:12:44.053 --> 00:12:46.129
Why do you feel like crying?

192
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.346
A man makes an investment,
it doesn't pay off.


193
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:52.096
Could I get an aspirin?
I have a headache.


194
00:12:52.144 --> 00:12:54.682
He's having a breakdown
and you're sick.


195
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.893
- Don't get upset.
- I'm not, I just had a rough day.


196
00:12:58.942 --> 00:13:01.943
You want an aspirin too?

197
00:13:01.987 --> 00:13:04.691
I ate all the aspirin,
what about Darvon?


198
00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:08.523
Yes, my analyst suggested that
when I have migraines.


199
00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:12.408
I used to get migraines but my analyst
cured me. Now I get cold sores.


200
00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:15.076
I still do. Big, ugly ones from tension.

201
00:13:15.124 --> 00:13:19.418
- I may need a lobotomy.
- With mine away I feel paralysed.


202
00:13:19.462 --> 00:13:21.999
You should move to hospital together.

203
00:13:22.047 --> 00:13:25.547
- You want a Fresca with the Darvon?
- Do you have apple juice?


204
00:13:25.592 --> 00:13:27.502
They're fantastic together.

205
00:13:27.553 --> 00:13:30.756
Have you ever had lithium
and tomato juice?


206
00:13:30.806 --> 00:13:34.221
No, but another neurotic tells me
it's unbelievable.


207
00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:37.185
Can I get a
Coke with nothing in it?

208
00:13:38.855 --> 00:13:40.931
I'll get the pills.

209
00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:47.735
Poor guy.
If there's anything we can do...


210
00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:56.110
He never should have married Nancy.

211
00:13:56.163 --> 00:13:58.571
I thought they were getting along.

212
00:13:58.624 --> 00:14:02.668
You're so busy all the time
you never see what's going on.


213
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:05.416
Didn't you think it strange
that he was married


214
00:14:05.464 --> 00:14:08.168
but still couldn't get a date
on New Year's Eve?


215
00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:10.505
Darling, don't get overwrought.

216
00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:14.715
This is Mr Christie,
I'm no longer at 752-0420,


217
00:14:14.764 --> 00:14:17.718
I'm gonna be home at 621 -4598.

218
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.886
What? Yes, I'll hold on.

219
00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:23.475
Honey, these things upset me.

220
00:14:23.523 --> 00:14:26.642
I'm experiencing a wave of insecurity.

221
00:14:26.692 --> 00:14:30.108
You are? Did I tell you
what happened to me today?


222
00:14:30.154 --> 00:14:32.526
I bought 100 acres of land in Florida

223
00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:35.490
and it turns out that

224
00:14:35.534 --> 00:14:38.535
My syndicate wanted to build
a golf course.


225
00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:41.532
All we can do is build
a three-hole golf course


226
00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:43.870
with the biggest sand trap
in the world.


227
00:14:45.544 --> 00:14:47.951
What are you taking a pill for?

228
00:14:48.004 --> 00:14:51.290
- I'm tense.
- Why?


229
00:14:51.341 --> 00:14:56.216
The whole subject of divorce
is traumatic for me.


230
00:14:56.262 --> 00:15:00.473
- He's getting divorced, not us.
- It's the idea of it.


231
00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:05.093
I guess I've never gotten over
my parents' divorce.


232
00:15:05.146 --> 00:15:07.518
Well, it's about time. Come here.

233
00:15:10.652 --> 00:15:14.400
You're so insecure.
I wish I could...


234
00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:17.318
Milt? Dick. That deal is unacceptable.
The figures are lousy.


235
00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.158
No, I can't take it.

236
00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:37.129
Marjorie, did Mr Hardy call?

237
00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:41.179
I'm at 922-3299.

238
00:15:41.223 --> 00:15:44.426
Yeah, I'll be here...
I'm picking my wife up.


239
00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:47.349
What? Who? Oh, Allan Felix.

240
00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:51.147
All right, I'll call him later. Bye-bye.

241
00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:56.022
Allan's calling again.
We got to find him a girl.


242
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.146
Somebody he can be with.

243
00:15:58.197 --> 00:16:00.190
Well, find him a nice girl.

244
00:16:00.241 --> 00:16:03.491
- There must be somebody here.
- Not single ones.


245
00:16:03.536 --> 00:16:06.240
- What about Carol?
- Engaged.


246
00:16:06.288 --> 00:16:10.617
- What about her?
- She's living with a priest.


247
00:16:12.044 --> 00:16:15.459
The tall one with the blonde hair?

248
00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:19.550
She'd eat him alive.
There'd be nothing left but his glasses.


249
00:16:19.593 --> 00:16:22.130
This is going to be
a bit of a problem.

250
00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:25.096
Mr Christie, there's a call for you.

251
00:16:27.725 --> 00:16:31.426
Listen, Linda and I
are going out for dinner tonight.


252
00:16:31.479 --> 00:16:34.433
We'll invite some nice girl
and we'll all go.


253
00:16:34.482 --> 00:16:36.770
You've got to start meeting girls.

254
00:16:36.817 --> 00:16:40.186
I haven't done that in two years.
I'm out of practice.


255
00:16:40.237 --> 00:16:43.238
When I was in practice,
I was out of practice.


256
00:16:43.282 --> 00:16:46.152
You invested your emotions
in a losing stock.


257
00:16:46.201 --> 00:16:48.277
It was wiped out.

258
00:16:48.328 --> 00:16:51.863
What do you do?
You reinvest in a more stable stock.


259
00:16:51.915 --> 00:16:55.035
Something with long-term
growth possibilities.


260
00:16:55.085 --> 00:16:57.042
Like who, General Motors?

261
00:16:57.087 --> 00:16:59.163
Come on, shape up.

262
00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:03.377
She'd have to be damn good
to do anything for my morale at all.


263
00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:06.711
- Who can we get?
- You don't have anybody in mind?


264
00:17:06.763 --> 00:17:09.763
- We have several in mind.
- What kind do you like?


265
00:17:09.807 --> 00:17:12.594
- He likes neurotics.
- I like blondes.


266
00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:15.312
Blondes with long hair and short skirts

267
00:17:15.354 --> 00:17:18.438
and boots and big chests
and bright and witty.


268
00:17:18.482 --> 00:17:20.688
Don't set yourself silly standards.

269
00:17:20.734 --> 00:17:23.569
She must be beautiful with a big bust?

270
00:17:23.612 --> 00:17:26.778
And a good behind.
Something I can sink my teeth into.


271
00:17:26.823 --> 00:17:29.990
- He was always fussy.
- But look at the result.


272
00:17:30.035 --> 00:17:32.360
You never went out.

273
00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:35.199
Sally has long hair
and a good size chest.


274
00:17:35.248 --> 00:17:38.581
- What's good size?
- Like this I guess.


275
00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:41.413
- She's not very bright.
- What does she do?


276
00:17:41.462 --> 00:17:44.249
- She works for an astrologer.
- Forget it.


277
00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:46.374
You might get her into bed.

278
00:17:46.425 --> 00:17:49.426
With my luck
I won't get her into a chair.


279
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.590
These girls
often don't have great minds.


280
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.724
Why all this fuss over
a dinner companion?


281
00:17:55.768 --> 00:17:59.516
Look, I can't go out,
I'm still attached to Nancy.


282
00:17:59.563 --> 00:18:02.647
Will you forget about Nancy?
She's gone.


283
00:18:03.942 --> 00:18:07.774
That's true. She wanted to be free
so she could swing.


284
00:18:07.821 --> 00:18:09.944
Darling, think of somebody.

285
00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:12.480
I can just picture what she's up to.

286
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.865
Baby, this is wonderful.

287
00:18:20.917 --> 00:18:24.332
My ex-husband would never take me
on a motorcycle.


288
00:18:24.378 --> 00:18:27.829
He fell off a scooter
and broke his collar bone.


289
00:18:27.882 --> 00:18:31.167
And I mean the kind of scooter
you push.


290
00:18:31.218 --> 00:18:34.088
Movies. That's his whole life,
he's a watcher.


291
00:18:34.137 --> 00:18:36.011
I'm a doer.

292
00:18:36.056 --> 00:18:39.804
It's been so long
since I've been made love to


293
00:18:39.851 --> 00:18:41.927
by a handsome blond man.

294
00:18:42.687 --> 00:18:46.021
We're divorced two weeks
and she's dating a Nazi.


295
00:18:46.066 --> 00:18:49.232
- What about Sharon?
- I like the name.


296
00:18:49.277 --> 00:18:52.610
She works as
a photographer's assistant.


297
00:18:52.655 --> 00:18:54.861
- She's bright and cute.
- Let's go.


298
00:18:54.907 --> 00:18:56.816
- Call her.
- Perfect.


299
00:18:56.867 --> 00:19:00.450
- What will you say?
- I'll ask if she's free for dinner.


300
00:19:00.496 --> 00:19:03.497
Don't mention the divorce.
Say my wife's dead.


301
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.333
I don't know if we should do this.
The old tension's beginning to set in.


302
00:19:08.378 --> 00:19:11.296
Sharon Lake, please. 
Linda Christie.

303
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.628
I don't want to hear this.

304
00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:16.213
It's Linda, how are you?

305
00:19:17.304 --> 00:19:21.171
Fine. We're going to dinner tonight
with an old friend,


306
00:19:21.224 --> 00:19:24.509
we thought you might want to join us.

307
00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:28.724
No, it's nothing.
We just have the radio on.


308
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:33.976
- You don't know him.
- A widower.


309
00:19:34.028 --> 00:19:37.278
Tell her my wife died
in a mine shaft explosion.


310
00:19:37.323 --> 00:19:39.564
He's lots of fun. 
You'll like him.

311
00:19:39.617 --> 00:19:44.159
If she doesn't want to, forget it.
I don't need this aggravation.


312
00:19:44.204 --> 00:19:47.039
We'll pick you up at eight o'clock.

313
00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:49.121
Simple dress.

314
00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:51.456
Sure, flats are OK.

315
00:19:51.503 --> 00:19:54.836
Let her wear heels.
What am l? Toulouse-Lautrec?


316
00:19:56.508 --> 00:19:59.081
Bye-bye. You're set.

317
00:19:59.135 --> 00:20:01.970
I really have mixed feelings about this.

318
00:20:02.013 --> 00:20:05.097
What if I have this chick in bed
and Nancy comes back?


319
00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:07.928
Let's not hope for too much
this first night.


320
00:20:07.977 --> 00:20:11.559
- Did she say anything about me?
- She doesn't know you!


321
00:20:11.605 --> 00:20:13.764
You never said I was a widower.

322
00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:17.648
I got you the date,
you tell her about your wife's death.


323
00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:19.687
I'm excited about this.

324
00:20:19.738 --> 00:20:22.941
We'll pick Sharon up
and then you after eight.


325
00:20:22.991 --> 00:20:25.909
I can't stay out late,
I have an early meeting.


326
00:20:25.952 --> 00:20:28.906
We can eat at the Pier in Sausalito.

327
00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:31.078
Wonderful. It's so romantic.

328
00:20:31.124 --> 00:20:34.872
The food is terrible
and I think it's going to rain.


329
00:20:34.919 --> 00:20:38.370
I'm going to shower
and douse my body with Canoe.


330
00:20:39.298 --> 00:20:43.378
I'm going home.
I'm going to brush all my teeth.


331
00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:47.133
I think he and
Sharon should hit it off.

332
00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:49.636
- Yeah?
- You don't think so?


333
00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:51.123
He'll probably calm down by tonight.

334
00:20:53.312 --> 00:20:55.470
I wish she'd seen me before.

335
00:20:55.522 --> 00:20:59.734
I hate to be there on a blind date
when the girl first sees me.


336
00:20:59.776 --> 00:21:04.771
What if she's disappointed
and she laughs or screams?


337
00:21:12.498 --> 00:21:14.158
Ridiculous.

338
00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:17.659
Has a girl ever once reacted
by laughing or screaming?


339
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:20.463
Once. A co-ed from Brooklyn College.

340
00:21:20.505 --> 00:21:23.292
Came to the door,
saw me and passed out.


341
00:21:23.341 --> 00:21:25.797
She was weak from dieting, though.

342
00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:50.569
What the hell?

343
00:21:50.617 --> 00:21:54.401
Bogart was short.
That never seemed to bother anybody.


344
00:21:54.454 --> 00:21:57.028
You're starting off on the wrong foot.

345
00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.158
- Yeah, negative.
- Sure.


346
00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:02.708
She's getting the best of you
before the game starts.


347
00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:05.459
What's that stuff you put on your face?

348
00:22:05.507 --> 00:22:10.168
- Canoe. It's an aftershave lotion.
- What about that other stuff?


349
00:22:10.219 --> 00:22:13.884
Lavoris, Mennen spray deodorant
and baby powder.


350
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:16.932
You're gonna smell like
a French cathouse.


351
00:22:16.976 --> 00:22:20.096
- I need them.
- Why? Are you ashamed of sweat?


352
00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:22.221
I want to make an impression.

353
00:22:22.273 --> 00:22:26.436
You know, kid, somewhere in life
you got turned around.


354
00:22:26.485 --> 00:22:29.058
It's her job to smell nice for you.

355
00:22:29.112 --> 00:22:33.525
Don't tell her you don't drink,
she'll think you're a boy scout.


356
00:22:33.575 --> 00:22:35.449
And don't get nervous.

357
00:22:35.494 --> 00:22:39.158
The only bad thing is
if she turns out to be a virgin


358
00:22:39.205 --> 00:22:41.281
or a cop.

359
00:22:41.332 --> 00:22:44.119
With my luck,
she'll turn out to be both.


360
00:22:44.168 --> 00:22:46.078
You know he's right.

361
00:22:46.129 --> 00:22:50.209
A lot of women are turned on by
a masculine, earthy quality.


362
00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:55.089
I shouldn't have put
so much Binoca under my arms.


363
00:22:55.137 --> 00:22:58.755
Wouldn't it be great
if we hit it off at first sight?


364
00:22:59.642 --> 00:23:03.342
Why not?
They say that dames are simple.


365
00:23:04.354 --> 00:23:07.937
I never met one who didn't understand
a slap in the mouth


366
00:23:07.983 --> 00:23:10.059
or a slug from a .45.

367
00:23:11.903 --> 00:23:14.359
Come here, Sharon.

368
00:23:16.658 --> 00:23:18.864
You are fantastic.

369
00:23:19.827 --> 00:23:23.991
Up until tonight, the doctors had told
me that I was frigid.


370
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.574
I want to thank you
for proving them wrong.


371
00:23:27.627 --> 00:23:32.087
You got any girl friends with
the same problem, bring them over.


372
00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:35.915
When Dick and Linda spoke of you,
they used terms like,


373
00:23:35.968 --> 00:23:38.541
"brilliant " and "genius"

374
00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:42.047
but they didn't say
that you were also an animal.


375
00:23:43.016 --> 00:23:46.017
Sorry I had to slap you around,
sweetheart,


376
00:23:46.061 --> 00:23:49.394
but you got hysterical
when I said "No more."


377
00:24:05.538 --> 00:24:07.495
It's Linda.

378
00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:13.248
I'm alone. Sharon's with Dick,
they're out parking.


379
00:24:13.295 --> 00:24:16.130
He sent me in
to make sure everything's OK.


380
00:24:16.173 --> 00:24:18.331
I didn't realise it was so late.

381
00:24:18.383 --> 00:24:21.467
Did you break a bottle
of shaving lotion?


382
00:24:21.511 --> 00:24:24.595
- I'm wearing too much?
- It's a touch strong.


383
00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:27.889
Once we get out into the air,
you won't notice.


384
00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:30.176
I better set this place up quickly.

385
00:24:30.228 --> 00:24:33.478
It's fine.
We'll just have a quick drink and go.


386
00:24:33.523 --> 00:24:37.141
A few carefully-placed objects
create the proper impression.


387
00:24:37.193 --> 00:24:40.893
You can't leave books lying around
like you're reading them!


388
00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:44.066
- It creates an image.
- You don't need an image.


389
00:24:46.994 --> 00:24:50.030
Got just the thing,
my 100-yard-dash medal.


390
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.541
- You can't leave out a track medal.
- Why? I paid $20 for it.


391
00:24:55.836 --> 00:24:59.667
I got a big decision to make.
Do I go with Oscar Peterson


392
00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:01.873
or Bartók String Quartet No. 5?

393
00:25:01.925 --> 00:25:05.874
Play Oscar Peterson and leave Bartók
out so everybody can see it.


394
00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:07.802
That's a good idea.

395
00:25:07.847 --> 00:25:12.308
I've never seen anybody go to
so much trouble to impress a date.


396
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:16.680
If you devoted so much time to Nancy,
I don't see why she left.


397
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:21.558
I used to write her poems, take
her to restaurants and order in French.


398
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.101
The waiter would bring
the wrong things.


399
00:25:24.154 --> 00:25:27.072
If you just leaned across
and kissed her...


400
00:25:27.115 --> 00:25:31.327
I tried. She used to say,
"Not here, everybody's staring."


401
00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:34.323
Once, my sleeve caught fire...

402
00:25:34.372 --> 00:25:36.579
See, you laughed. 
It's funny, right?

403
00:25:36.624 --> 00:25:39.542
She took it
as a symbol of my clumsiness.


404
00:25:42.005 --> 00:25:45.705
Tremendous poise.
I'm an absolute master.


405
00:25:57.478 --> 00:25:59.554
Come on in.

406
00:26:11.032 --> 00:26:14.531
Allan, this is Sharon.

407
00:26:15.662 --> 00:26:19.529
I've got friends on this block,
right across the street.


408
00:26:19.582 --> 00:26:23.366
Do you know the Gibsons?
They're a fantastic couple.


409
00:26:23.419 --> 00:26:27.796
- He's an interior decorator.
- That's sort of a hobby of mine.


410
00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:35.631
The key to it is to avoid looking
like you used a decorator.


411
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:37.969
I've got to make one quick call.

412
00:26:40.102 --> 00:26:43.517
- Linda, are you wearing Jasmine?
- Me? No.


413
00:26:43.563 --> 00:26:47.181
- What are we drinking?
- J&B on the rocks.


414
00:26:47.233 --> 00:26:49.191
A Harveys Bristol Cream.

415
00:26:49.235 --> 00:26:51.311
I'll have the usual.

416
00:26:52.197 --> 00:26:55.363
- Bourbon and water.
- A bourbon man.


417
00:26:55.992 --> 00:27:00.654
I got to cut down on my drinking.
I'm putting away a quart a day.


418
00:27:07.878 --> 00:27:12.624
This is Mr Christie,
I'm no longer at 431 -5997.


419
00:27:12.675 --> 00:27:15.593
I'll be at... What
time did that come in?

420
00:27:19.974 --> 00:27:22.429
Sharon did a movie.

421
00:27:22.476 --> 00:27:25.050
- Underground.
- Stag film?


422
00:27:25.104 --> 00:27:28.888
Underground, you know, arty, 16mm.

423
00:27:28.941 --> 00:27:33.353
- Allan is interested in cinema.
- Really? What do you do?


424
00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:37.152
I'm a writer. Nothing much.
Film Weekly.


425
00:27:37.199 --> 00:27:39.275
Articles, essays, criticisms.

426
00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:44.237
This film I did got very good reviews.
I got singled out.


427
00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:47.159
Course, I was the only girl in it
with nine men.


428
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:49.782
What's it called? 
Maybe I saw it.

429
00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:52.540
Gang Bang.

430
00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:57.049
These films have the raunchiest titles.
Really, it wasn't sexy.


431
00:27:57.093 --> 00:28:00.924
You were all out of bourbon
so I made it straight water.


432
00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:04.471
It's so humid out,
I think it's going to rain.


433
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:08.680
Maybe that's why I have a headache.
I get terrible sinus attacks.


434
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:11.730
You should have them drained.

435
00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:14.347
That's why it's silly to go the Pier.

436
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.485
Could you turn the music down
a little bit?


437
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:19.605
Of course.

438
00:28:21.157 --> 00:28:23.992
Why go to an outdoor restaurant
in the rain?


439
00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:28.033
- We used to go walking in the rain.
- I love the rain.


440
00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:31.864
It washes memories
off the sidewalk of life.


441
00:28:39.174 --> 00:28:42.674
Gee, Allan,
you really have the delicate touch.


442
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.180
He's a trifle tense,
he had some misfortune with his wife.


443
00:28:47.224 --> 00:28:50.308
- His wife?
- His ex-wife. She's gone.


444
00:28:50.352 --> 00:28:52.391
- She's dead.
- How awful.


445
00:28:52.437 --> 00:28:54.679
She's not really dead.

446
00:28:54.731 --> 00:28:58.064
Technically not dead,
but we're not dating.


447
00:28:58.109 --> 00:29:01.976
- She left him.
- I'm sorry.


448
00:29:20.631 --> 00:29:24.331
- Is he on anything?
- He's been under some strain lately.


449
00:29:27.345 --> 00:29:32.007
This is Mr Christie,
I'm at The Hong Fat Noodle Company.


450
00:29:32.058 --> 00:29:36.720
That's 824-7996.

451
00:29:36.771 --> 00:29:39.309
Yeah, right. OK. Bye-bye.

452
00:29:40.316 --> 00:29:45.939
What's interesting is when they eat
rice with chopsticks authentically,


453
00:29:45.988 --> 00:29:50.697
they bring it up to their mouths
in a shovelling move with your arm.


454
00:29:57.916 --> 00:29:59.992
What's the matter?

455
00:30:00.043 --> 00:30:03.412
Would you excuse me a second?
I'll be right back.


456
00:30:06.925 --> 00:30:09.676
- She likes me.
- What?


457
00:30:09.719 --> 00:30:13.586
I can read women.
She wants me to come on with her.


458
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.889
She digs me.
She's playing it very coolly.


459
00:30:16.934 --> 00:30:19.686
I'm going to come on with her later.

460
00:30:22.857 --> 00:30:26.985
- Good night and thanks for dinner.
- It's only ten o'clock.


461
00:30:27.027 --> 00:30:29.862
I have a headache
and I have to get up early.


462
00:30:29.905 --> 00:30:32.396
- I'll walk you upstairs.
- It's OK.


463
00:30:32.449 --> 00:30:35.118
This city's a jungle, I better go.

464
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.695
If I'm not down in an hour,
sublet my apartment.


465
00:30:43.418 --> 00:30:45.410
You know any other girls?

466
00:30:45.462 --> 00:30:48.213
I don't know if any of them
are his type.


467
00:30:48.256 --> 00:30:50.794
Most of the girls I know are normal.

468
00:30:50.842 --> 00:30:52.918
He's just over-anxious.

469
00:30:52.969 --> 00:30:56.503
As soon as she came over
he went into his act.


470
00:31:00.309 --> 00:31:02.432
Well, night.

471
00:31:02.478 --> 00:31:06.012
You know, Sharon,
a dame like you and a guy like...


472
00:31:10.152 --> 00:31:12.440
How'd it go with Sharon?

473
00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:16.530
Really?

474
00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:20.909
I keep striking out with women
and you keep laughing.


475
00:31:20.954 --> 00:31:24.204
Everybody's insecure, Allan,
not just you.


476
00:31:24.248 --> 00:31:26.324
No, you're wrong, Dick is.

477
00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:29.998
Me? Are you kidding? 
Ask my analyst.

478
00:31:30.046 --> 00:31:34.174
- How many times a week do you go?
- Three, but one is group.


479
00:31:34.216 --> 00:31:37.087
Anyone in your group
who'd be good for me?


480
00:31:37.136 --> 00:31:41.548
Emotionally disturbed women are
interesting. A pervert or something.


481
00:31:42.391 --> 00:31:46.720
Jennifer? What do mean "crazy"?

482
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.846
It'll strictly be sex.

483
00:31:48.897 --> 00:31:51.269
She's too weird for a relationship.

484
00:31:51.316 --> 00:31:53.392
I don't mind just sex.

485
00:31:53.443 --> 00:31:56.728
I'd prefer a girl
that doesn't get hung up on me.


486
00:31:56.779 --> 00:31:59.270
I definitely think we should try it.

487
00:31:59.324 --> 00:32:03.535
I really appreciate this.
I know it must be a drag for you.


488
00:32:03.578 --> 00:32:06.151
You know who's not insecure?
Bogart.


489
00:32:06.205 --> 00:32:09.656
That's not real life.
You set too high a standard.


490
00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:13.124
If you're gonna identify,
who am I gonna pick? My rabbi?


491
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:17.002
- Bogart's a perfect image.
- You don't need to, you're you.


492
00:32:17.049 --> 00:32:19.884
I know that you can't believe that.

493
00:32:19.927 --> 00:32:22.168
Anyway, onward to Jennifer.

494
00:32:55.335 --> 00:32:59.415
Allan, I won't deny it.
I'm a nymphomaniac.


495
00:32:59.464 --> 00:33:04.173
I discovered sex very early.
I slept with everybody.


496
00:33:04.219 --> 00:33:07.504
My schoolteacher,
my sister's husband,


497
00:33:07.555 --> 00:33:10.759
the string section
of the New York Philharmonic.


498
00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:14.143
I want to have sex all the time,
play all the time


499
00:33:14.188 --> 00:33:17.770
otherwise you're just down,
and why be down?


500
00:33:17.816 --> 00:33:20.733
The best way to get up is sex.

501
00:33:21.403 --> 00:33:23.479
I'm not like my sisters.

502
00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:27.230
They're so inhibited,
they never want to do anything.


503
00:33:27.283 --> 00:33:30.735
I believe in having sex
as often, as freely


504
00:33:30.787 --> 00:33:33.622
and as intensely as possible.

505
00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:38.497
What do you take me for?

506
00:33:40.838 --> 00:33:43.411
How did I misread those signs?

507
00:33:45.092 --> 00:33:47.583
This stuff just knocks me out.

508
00:33:47.636 --> 00:33:51.254
We're in a room that has some
of the highest achievements


509
00:33:51.306 --> 00:33:55.174
- of Western civilisation.
- There's no girls.


510
00:33:55.977 --> 00:33:58.136
Look at the Rouault. Look.

511
00:33:59.522 --> 00:34:01.598
It's pretty.

512
00:34:02.984 --> 00:34:06.519
If you could have any painting,
what would you pick?


513
00:34:06.571 --> 00:34:08.978
- A van Gogh. Any van Gogh.
- Me too.


514
00:34:09.032 --> 00:34:13.777
I feel a mystical attraction
for van Gogh. Why is that?


515
00:34:13.828 --> 00:34:17.872
I don't know. I just know
he cut off his ear for a girl he loved.


516
00:34:17.915 --> 00:34:20.785
That's the kind of thing
you'd do for a girl.


517
00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:23.160
I'd have to like her a lot.

518
00:34:23.212 --> 00:34:26.296
I wonder if Dick
would cut his ear off for me?


519
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.543
I don't think you should ask him.
He's very busy.


520
00:34:29.593 --> 00:34:32.878
It must be fantastic
to be loved so intensely.


521
00:34:33.763 --> 00:34:38.425
Why don't we split and see if there's
any action at the Berkeley Museum?


522
00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:40.683
There's one.

523
00:34:41.688 --> 00:34:45.056
- She's great.
- Go ahead, speak to her.


524
00:34:45.108 --> 00:34:48.061
- No, are you kidding?
- Go on.


525
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.186
Go on, give it a try.

526
00:34:50.237 --> 00:34:53.072
That's what we're here for. Go on.

527
00:34:53.115 --> 00:34:55.274
Casual.

528
00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.912
It's a lovely Jackson Pollock.

529
00:35:03.959 --> 00:35:06.035
Yes, it is.

530
00:35:07.254 --> 00:35:09.412
What does it say to you?

531
00:35:09.464 --> 00:35:13.165
It restates the negativeness
of the universe.


532
00:35:13.218 --> 00:35:18.674
The hideous, lonely emptiness
of existence. Nothingness.


533
00:35:18.723 --> 00:35:23.848
The predicament of man forced to live
in a barren, godless eternity


534
00:35:23.895 --> 00:35:28.058
Iike a tiny flame
flickering in an immense void


535
00:35:28.107 --> 00:35:32.270
with nothing but waste,
horror and degradation


536
00:35:32.319 --> 00:35:37.314
forming a useless straightjacket
in a black absurd cosmos.


537
00:35:38.408 --> 00:35:42.785
- What are you doing Saturday?
- Committing suicide.


538
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:44.952
What about Friday night?

539
00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:54.879
If they're beautiful, they're crazy.
Beauty drives a woman crazy.


540
00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:57.000
What's he ranting about?

541
00:35:57.051 --> 00:35:59.886
Why am I going to the beach?
I hate the beach.


542
00:35:59.929 --> 00:36:02.218
I don't like swimming or the sun.

543
00:36:02.264 --> 00:36:05.680
I'm red-headed, fair-skinned.
I don't tan, I stroke.


544
00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:08.846
A lot of good women go to the beach
at weekends.


545
00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:11.184
Secretaries, receptionists.

546
00:36:11.231 --> 00:36:14.149
I want a really, really, great woman.

547
00:36:14.192 --> 00:36:17.396
Well, Madame Curie's dead,
who else is there?


548
00:36:17.446 --> 00:36:19.771
I thought you were too busy
to go away.


549
00:36:19.823 --> 00:36:23.357
A few guys from the office are going,
I've got a few meetings.


550
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.947
Do you think we'll get to see you?

551
00:36:25.995 --> 00:36:29.281
- I got you pencilled in for dinner.
- Very funny.


552
00:36:29.332 --> 00:36:32.368
- Are there spiders at the beach?
- Come on!


553
00:36:32.418 --> 00:36:37.080
Anything with more than two legs
that walks across my chest kills me.


554
00:36:37.131 --> 00:36:40.831
- We got to find him a broad.
- That's for sure!


555
00:36:40.885 --> 00:36:44.550
- I'm carsick.
- Come on, Allan!


556
00:36:44.596 --> 00:36:46.803
We're gonna drop you in the bay.

557
00:36:47.766 --> 00:36:52.760
This is Mr Christie,
I'm longer at 731 -071 1.


558
00:36:52.813 --> 00:36:58.269
I'll be at 885-0714.
That's good for the whole weekend.


559
00:36:58.318 --> 00:37:01.769
- What a terrific beach house.
- Glad you like it.


560
00:37:01.821 --> 00:37:04.395
Let's burn it down for the insurance.

561
00:37:04.449 --> 00:37:09.360
There's a single bed in here!
What happens if I get lucky?


562
00:37:09.412 --> 00:37:11.535
You make love on the beach.

563
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:13.620
On the beach?

564
00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:17.913
I'll be making love in the sand and
the tide will come in and carry me off.


565
00:37:17.962 --> 00:37:20.583
I'll score and drown at the same time.

566
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.589
Look at that, that is pretty.
Look out there.


567
00:37:27.054 --> 00:37:30.505
That's really beautiful.
The fog's gonna creep in.


568
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.597
Look, you can see the seagulls
flying over the cesspool.


569
00:37:41.734 --> 00:37:46.195
This is fun. I haven't been
to a place like this in a long time.


570
00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:49.939
I'm getting a heart attack,
I can't believe that girl.


571
00:37:51.076 --> 00:37:54.113
I'm at 392-8098.

572
00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:14.887
She's a doll. I'd sell my mother
to the Arabs for her.


573
00:38:14.933 --> 00:38:17.470
Why don't you ask her to dance?

574
00:38:17.518 --> 00:38:19.594
I can't. I don't know her.

575
00:38:23.274 --> 00:38:28.232
I can't stay long. I've gotta get up early
to play tennis with the guys.


576
00:38:28.279 --> 00:38:30.152
You wanna dance?

577
00:38:30.197 --> 00:38:34.029
We can't do those dances,
you have to be under 16 to look good.


578
00:38:34.076 --> 00:38:37.990
I love you, miss, whoever you are.
I want to have your child.


579
00:38:38.038 --> 00:38:41.407
- All right, get up and do it.
- No, I can't dance.


580
00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:45.325
I'm scared. I had measles as a child,
my body won't function.


581
00:38:45.378 --> 00:38:47.454
Come on, go.

582
00:38:50.091 --> 00:38:55.002
Now, start dancing. You ready?
Keep count. And it's one, two...


583
00:38:55.054 --> 00:38:57.426
One, two.

584
00:38:57.473 --> 00:39:00.225
Right. Go ahead, say something to her.

585
00:39:02.937 --> 00:39:05.013
One, two...

586
00:39:09.486 --> 00:39:11.976
Try something more meaningful.

587
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:16.698
Three, four...

588
00:39:22.123 --> 00:39:24.199
Speak to her.

589
00:39:28.337 --> 00:39:30.413
Are you interested in dancing?

590
00:39:30.464 --> 00:39:32.540
Get lost, creep.

591
00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.796
- What did she say?
- She'd rather not.


592
00:39:50.149 --> 00:39:53.483
Even if we buy two more lots,
we'll have to wait.


593
00:39:53.528 --> 00:39:57.359
- It's cheaper to hold on to them.
- The price will move.


594
00:39:57.406 --> 00:40:01.570
It'll require using
our current holdings as collateral.


595
00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:04.536
You've got a lot going for you.

596
00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.288
You're bright, funny and you're
romantic, if you'd only believe it.


597
00:40:09.334 --> 00:40:12.370
Why put on a mask
every time you meet a girl?


598
00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:15.920
Will we be able to build?
Even in the new tax year?


599
00:40:15.966 --> 00:40:18.836
Why build if the interest rate
might go down?


600
00:40:18.885 --> 00:40:20.961
I keep telling you,

601
00:40:21.012 --> 00:40:23.799
be yourself
and a girl will fall in love with you.


602
00:40:23.848 --> 00:40:27.181
You've been great,
spending your time with me.


603
00:40:28.019 --> 00:40:31.933
- I'll tell you the truth, I'm having a ball.
- Are you?


604
00:40:31.981 --> 00:40:35.978
It'll make a big difference.
If you're gonna pay $600 a lot...


605
00:40:36.026 --> 00:40:38.019
It's a great opportunity.

606
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.940
You may have half a per cent
more interest rate.


607
00:40:42.241 --> 00:40:45.656
I got you a present
cos I know it's your birthday.


608
00:40:45.702 --> 00:40:47.778
How'd you know?

609
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:50.534
You mentioned the date
and I remembered it.


610
00:40:50.582 --> 00:40:54.081
It's the same date
my mother had her hysterectomy.


611
00:40:58.256 --> 00:41:01.956
It's lovely. It's beautiful.

612
00:41:02.009 --> 00:41:03.883
A plastic skunk.

613
00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:08.305
It's so cute and I heard you say skunks
are your favourite animals.


614
00:41:10.017 --> 00:41:11.926
I'm so touched.

615
00:41:11.977 --> 00:41:14.136
- You like it?
- I love it.


616
00:41:14.188 --> 00:41:17.142
It doesn't do anything,
it's just a skunk.


617
00:41:17.191 --> 00:41:20.026
She liked your present
better than mine.


618
00:41:20.068 --> 00:41:23.484
She's usually so excited
when I get her something


619
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.068
but all she could talk about
was her skunk.


620
00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:28.274
It's your imagination.

621
00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:30.698
I don't know. She's moody lately.

622
00:41:30.745 --> 00:41:33.283
- Cos you neglect her.
- I know.


623
00:41:33.331 --> 00:41:36.534
- Did she say something?
- She doesn't have to.


624
00:41:36.584 --> 00:41:40.332
I see the two of you together.
Plus she said something.


625
00:41:40.379 --> 00:41:42.953
It's nothing we haven't been through.

626
00:41:43.007 --> 00:41:45.924
She's very insecure,
she needs attention.


627
00:41:45.968 --> 00:41:50.048
What's she insecure about?
She knows I'm crazy about her.


628
00:41:50.097 --> 00:41:53.596
Why, because I'm too busy now
to always dote on her?


629
00:41:53.642 --> 00:41:56.050
Linda's used to being fussed over.

630
00:41:56.103 --> 00:41:59.602
She's always been pretty,
high marks in college.


631
00:41:59.648 --> 00:42:04.025
I sometimes think she married me
because I didn't fawn over her.


632
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:06.441
But you must admit you're driven.

633
00:42:06.488 --> 00:42:09.821
Do you know what's happening
in the stock market?


634
00:42:09.866 --> 00:42:12.701
- Where are we going?
- There she is.


635
00:42:12.744 --> 00:42:17.204
She works in my office.
She just broke up with her boyfriend.


636
00:42:17.248 --> 00:42:20.699
- There's too many people at the table.
- Come on!


637
00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:23.123
I don't want to. 
We'll do it later.

638
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.875
- What shall I say?
- Ask her to dinner.


639
00:42:25.923 --> 00:42:28.840
I can't.
Why can't you and Linda come...


640
00:42:28.884 --> 00:42:30.960
Cos I have to work late.

641
00:42:31.011 --> 00:42:33.300
Julie, this is Allan Felix.

642
00:42:33.347 --> 00:42:36.098
Would you like to go to dinner tonight?

643
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:40.138
- That's right to the point.
- That was pretty fast!


644
00:42:41.062 --> 00:42:43.387
Forgive me, I'm...

645
00:42:43.439 --> 00:42:45.266
It needed tossing anyhow.

646
00:42:50.822 --> 00:42:54.025
Let's go in there and get stoned
and watch the freaks.


647
00:42:54.075 --> 00:42:57.408
You sure you don't want to go
to the movies?


648
00:42:57.453 --> 00:42:59.529
Come on!

649
00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.627
- You wanna dance?
- No, thanks.


650
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.803
I didn't ask you, I asked her.

651
00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:22.422
I don't wanna dance either.

652
00:43:24.562 --> 00:43:28.145
- What the hell is this?
- 7 Up.


653
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.598
I'm on the wagon, doctor's orders.

654
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:33.985
My hand shakes.
It's like battle fatigue...


655
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.272
He kills me.

656
00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:39.696
What's your name, honey?

657
00:43:41.078 --> 00:43:44.992
- It's a nice name.
- Must get her back to the orphanage.


658
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.622
I take her out once a year to the zoo
and the circus. Excuse me.


659
00:43:48.668 --> 00:43:52.333
- Sit down.
- I'd love to stay but I gotta be up early.


660
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.464
Going to a temple,
it's my people's Sabbath.


661
00:43:58.553 --> 00:44:01.838
- Come here.
- Chris is coming over, is he?


662
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:05.009
I want you to meet
this good-looking broad.


663
00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:07.135
Thanks for inviting us over.

664
00:44:07.186 --> 00:44:10.270
- Just get right in here.
- I love parties.


665
00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:13.564
You'd look real good
on the back of my chopper.


666
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:18.779
Have you fellas seen the new
production of The Trojan Women?


667
00:44:21.575 --> 00:44:23.614
What are you doing?

668
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.736
Financial reports.

669
00:44:25.787 --> 00:44:27.863
Which are not fun.

670
00:44:29.249 --> 00:44:31.786
Have you seen Allan around lately?

671
00:44:32.877 --> 00:44:36.293
Oh, he was here before.
He's out tonight.


672
00:44:37.715 --> 00:44:40.918
- On a date?
- Yes, I fixed him up.


673
00:44:40.968 --> 00:44:42.961
You did?

674
00:44:44.054 --> 00:44:46.130
Who with?

675
00:44:46.181 --> 00:44:48.304
One of the girls at the office.

676
00:44:49.393 --> 00:44:51.469
Which one?

677
00:44:52.604 --> 00:44:56.055
- Which one is she? Do I know her?
- Very sexy.


678
00:44:56.108 --> 00:44:59.227
And bright.
I think they'll like each other.


679
00:44:59.277 --> 00:45:02.112
Is Julie the blonde one with big eyes?

680
00:45:02.155 --> 00:45:04.444
Blonde, big eyes, very earthy,

681
00:45:04.491 --> 00:45:06.946
wears those see-through blouses.

682
00:45:06.993 --> 00:45:09.069
Every guy in the office likes her.

683
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.363
You think she's right for Allan?

684
00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:15.166
Cos to me,
she doesn't seem like the type.


685
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.544
- He liked her.
- Really?


686
00:45:20.298 --> 00:45:22.421
How do you know?

687
00:45:22.467 --> 00:45:24.543
I could feel it.

688
00:45:24.594 --> 00:45:28.426
- Did he say anything?
- Hey, I'm trying to work.


689
00:45:28.473 --> 00:45:30.549
OK, I'm sorry.

690
00:45:33.978 --> 00:45:38.391
- Those guys are following us.
- Don't worry, I'm a fast runner.


691
00:45:38.441 --> 00:45:42.355
- Where're you going with that chick?
- Don't look back.


692
00:45:42.403 --> 00:45:45.772
- I'm scared.
- I'll go into my fake limp.


693
00:45:45.823 --> 00:45:48.195
Let's all go on a little party.

694
00:45:48.242 --> 00:45:50.483
Fellas, I'm a veteran.

695
00:45:50.535 --> 00:45:53.869
Get rid of this creep
and I'll take you for a ride.


696
00:45:53.914 --> 00:45:56.868
Take your hands off her!
Did I say that?


697
00:45:56.917 --> 00:45:59.538
All right, shorty, let's go...

698
00:46:00.837 --> 00:46:05.499
- Your tattoo's coming off on my neck.
- I'm gonna start screaming!


699
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.005
Don't worry, I can handle this.

700
00:46:12.223 --> 00:46:14.381
Start screaming.

701
00:46:24.943 --> 00:46:27.944
- Allan, is that you?
- Yes.


702
00:46:27.988 --> 00:46:31.154
- How'd it go?
- I got into a fight.


703
00:46:33.076 --> 00:46:35.567
What? You got into a fight? With who?

704
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.867
Some guys got tough with Julie.
I had to teach them a lesson.


705
00:46:39.916 --> 00:46:42.205
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.


706
00:46:42.251 --> 00:46:47.328
I snapped my chin onto a guy's fist
and hit one in the knee with my nose.


707
00:46:48.424 --> 00:46:51.709
- Where's Julie?
- She ran off with the leader.


708
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.339
They're getting married. It never
would have worked between us.


709
00:46:56.390 --> 00:47:01.052
She's Protestant, I'm Catholic,
it's a great religious abyss.


710
00:47:01.103 --> 00:47:06.097
- Who were these guys?
- They said they were hairdressers.


711
00:47:06.149 --> 00:47:09.648
- Hard to believe.
- You want us to call a doctor?


712
00:47:09.694 --> 00:47:13.028
No, I'm fine.
I could use a three-foot Band-Aid


713
00:47:13.072 --> 00:47:15.563
until the pain subsides.

714
00:47:15.617 --> 00:47:20.195
She's laughing and my sex life
is turning into the Petrified Forest.


715
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.489
Very funny.

716
00:47:40.182 --> 00:47:44.974
Ten million women in the country
and I can't wind up with one.


717
00:47:47.105 --> 00:47:49.975
Come on,
you had some laughs with Linda.


718
00:47:50.024 --> 00:47:54.104
There's no pressure with Linda,
I'm not trying to make her.


719
00:47:54.153 --> 00:47:57.356
I'm sure if I met her on a date,
we'd have no fun.


720
00:47:57.406 --> 00:48:00.656
The girls I try and score with
I can't get to first base.


721
00:48:28.728 --> 00:48:32.595
I'm turning into the strike-out king
of San Francisco.


722
00:48:32.648 --> 00:48:37.690
What do you expect? I always said
you were not the romantic type.


723
00:48:37.736 --> 00:48:40.109
What's the matter with me, Nancy?

724
00:48:40.155 --> 00:48:44.105
You're a dreamer, you're awkward,
you're clumsy.


725
00:48:44.159 --> 00:48:48.371
They can see how desperate you are.
You've said it yourself.


726
00:48:48.413 --> 00:48:52.493
Don't go by that girl tonight.
I was toying with her.


727
00:48:52.542 --> 00:48:56.706
Face it, you may be very sweet
but you're not sexy.


728
00:48:56.755 --> 00:49:00.586
Don't be so sure. You never said that
when we were married.


729
00:49:01.342 --> 00:49:03.299
I was thinking it.

730
00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:07.384
I bet she was.

731
00:49:07.431 --> 00:49:11.595
I wonder if she actually had an orgasm
while we were married


732
00:49:11.644 --> 00:49:14.051
or did she fake it that night?

733
00:49:16.982 --> 00:49:19.058
Is this the Perry residence?

734
00:49:20.235 --> 00:49:22.311
Can I speak to Marilyn?

735
00:49:24.114 --> 00:49:26.819
An old friend of hers, 
I dated her once.

736
00:49:27.826 --> 00:49:29.902
Do you remember?

737
00:49:29.953 --> 00:49:32.526
I'm stunned! It was 1 1 years ago.

738
00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.958
That's right.
Short with red hair and glasses.


739
00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:39.290
No, that's cleared up.

740
00:49:41.672 --> 00:49:44.210
How can I get in touch with her?

741
00:49:45.301 --> 00:49:47.424
Really?

742
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.628
She still feels that way?

743
00:49:50.639 --> 00:49:52.715
It's been 1 1 years.

744
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:56.514
When did you last speak with her?

745
00:49:59.064 --> 00:50:01.140
Last week.

746
00:50:01.191 --> 00:50:05.652
And she specified that she didn't
want you to give me the number?


747
00:50:06.738 --> 00:50:08.612
I see.

748
00:50:08.656 --> 00:50:10.732
OK, thank you.

749
00:50:16.956 --> 00:50:20.241
Excuse me,
could you tell me where Mr Felix is?


750
00:50:20.293 --> 00:50:23.626
- Right through that door.
- Thank you.


751
00:50:28.926 --> 00:50:31.761
- Are you busy?
- What are you doing here?


752
00:50:31.804 --> 00:50:34.341
- I don't feel so hot.
- What's wrong?


753
00:50:34.389 --> 00:50:37.094
What do you have
for an anxiety attack?


754
00:50:37.142 --> 00:50:39.715
Everything, I'm a drugstore.

755
00:50:39.769 --> 00:50:42.307
I have this throbbing in my stomach.

756
00:50:42.355 --> 00:50:44.893
How do know it's anxiety and not fear?

757
00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:48.061
- My stomach's jumpy.
- Is it hard to breathe?


758
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:50.649
I feel frightened and I don't know why.

759
00:50:50.697 --> 00:50:53.401
- I get that.
- Is it fear or anxiety?


760
00:50:53.449 --> 00:50:55.774
Homosexual panic.

761
00:50:55.826 --> 00:50:59.575
I always get this way
when Dick goes on a business trip.


762
00:50:59.622 --> 00:51:01.579
He had to fly to Cleveland.

763
00:51:01.624 --> 00:51:03.912
I got up, drove him to the airport

764
00:51:03.959 --> 00:51:06.497
and threw up
in the United Airlines terminal.


765
00:51:06.545 --> 00:51:08.419
I've thrown up there.

766
00:51:08.463 --> 00:51:11.038
I don't know what
it is that upsets me.

767
00:51:11.092 --> 00:51:14.876
Fear of separation.
I had to go to Washington once,


768
00:51:14.929 --> 00:51:17.254
and although I was leaving, I got sick

769
00:51:17.306 --> 00:51:19.513
and when I returned,
my wife threw up.


770
00:51:19.558 --> 00:51:23.686
My analyst would say I'm feeling guilty
because I want him to go.


771
00:51:23.729 --> 00:51:25.603
I can't understand you.

772
00:51:25.648 --> 00:51:28.898
You're a knockout,
why are you a mass of symptoms?


773
00:51:28.942 --> 00:51:31.018
Why is anybody screwed up?

774
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:33.821
I guess it happens
when you're a child.


775
00:51:33.864 --> 00:51:38.193
You think you're ugly, your parents
divorce, you feel abandoned.


776
00:51:38.243 --> 00:51:40.319
You must have the same thing.

777
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:43.703
My parents never got divorced,
although I begged them to.


778
00:51:43.748 --> 00:51:48.161
I know you think I'm nice,
I appreciate it. It's good for my ego.


779
00:51:48.211 --> 00:51:50.417
And I'm hypercritical.

780
00:51:50.463 --> 00:51:53.914
I have a tendency to reject
before I get rejected.


781
00:51:53.966 --> 00:51:56.124
That way I save time and money.

782
00:51:59.555 --> 00:52:03.255
- No date tonight?
- I had a date but she called it off.


783
00:52:03.308 --> 00:52:05.384
Some kind of Polish holiday.

784
00:52:06.353 --> 00:52:09.473
Why don't we go out to dinner
and hit a movie?


785
00:52:09.523 --> 00:52:12.310
I have a better idea.
Have dinner at my house.


786
00:52:12.359 --> 00:52:14.647
The Big Sleep's on tonight.

787
00:52:14.694 --> 00:52:17.316
Do you have anything for me to cook?

788
00:52:17.363 --> 00:52:20.234
Frozen steaks
and a bottle of champagne.


789
00:52:20.283 --> 00:52:22.690
What are you doing with champagne?

790
00:52:22.744 --> 00:52:27.156
I tried to cook to impress a girl.
Beef stroganoff in the pressure cooker.


791
00:52:27.206 --> 00:52:30.326
- How was it?
- I don't know. It's still on the wall.


792
00:52:30.376 --> 00:52:33.994
- I'll buy some stuff and bring it over.
- Fabulous.


793
00:52:34.046 --> 00:52:37.130
I'll get some asparagus,
salad and dessert.


794
00:52:37.174 --> 00:52:41.302
I love to cook but I never get a chance.
Dick's always so busy.


795
00:52:41.345 --> 00:52:43.468
Get a whole lot of stuff.

796
00:52:43.513 --> 00:52:46.763
You can open the champagne
but not just for me.


797
00:52:46.808 --> 00:52:51.137
I'll have one with you but you
have to put me to bed if I dance naked.


798
00:52:55.733 --> 00:52:59.731
This is gonna be great.
I've got a terrific rapport with Linda.


799
00:52:59.779 --> 00:53:01.855
I hate to see her depressed.

800
00:53:01.906 --> 00:53:07.066
It's gonna be a nice, cosy evening in.
Build a little fire.


801
00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:10.322
I'll get some candles,
set up some atmosphere.


802
00:53:10.372 --> 00:53:12.246
Open the champagne.

803
00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:16.123
Women are suckers for champagne,
it makes them crazy.


804
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:20.333
It makes them crazy?
What the hell am I talking about here?


805
00:53:20.382 --> 00:53:22.458
This is Linda, Dick's wife.

806
00:53:23.385 --> 00:53:25.958
So, you finally fell in love with her?

807
00:53:26.012 --> 00:53:30.840
- I just got carried away for a minute.
- You don't have to feel guilty.


808
00:53:30.892 --> 00:53:36.134
Over what? Two lonely people with
lots in common have dinner together.


809
00:53:36.189 --> 00:53:40.601
- We're platonic friends.
- That's not how she thinks of you.


810
00:53:40.651 --> 00:53:43.771
- How can you tell?
- Does she have to attack you?


811
00:53:43.821 --> 00:53:47.024
Don't get those candles,
they're for a Jewish holiday!


812
00:53:47.074 --> 00:53:51.949
- She's my friend's wife.
- She'll tell Dick and he'll beat you up.


813
00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:54.996
- She loves you, not him.
- He's not romantic.


814
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.412
- He could be.
- Don't listen to him.


815
00:53:57.459 --> 00:54:00.744
- Don't listen to her.
- We're in a supermarket.


816
00:54:01.963 --> 00:54:05.047
Get a grip on yourself, she's married.

817
00:54:05.091 --> 00:54:07.878
And to your best friend.

818
00:54:07.927 --> 00:54:11.047
They're never gonna
get a divorce either.


819
00:54:11.097 --> 00:54:13.588
Why can't I ever get a break?

820
00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:15.966
I'd like you to do me a favour.

821
00:54:16.018 --> 00:54:20.063
I've fallen in love with another woman,
it just happened.


822
00:54:20.105 --> 00:54:23.355
We're going to live in Alaska,
she's an Eskimo.


823
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.145
I thought perhaps while I'm gone,
you'd look after Linda.


824
00:54:28.197 --> 00:54:31.612
- Of course.
- Well, I'm off to Alaska.


825
00:54:31.658 --> 00:54:34.944
If you need me,
I'll be at Frozen Tundra 69290.


826
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:48.964
I'm so tense.
I don't know what's wrong.


827
00:54:50.051 --> 00:54:52.292
She'll be here any second.

828
00:54:52.345 --> 00:54:55.262
She is always complimenting me.

829
00:54:55.306 --> 00:54:59.967
I know she likes me
but does she like me that way?


830
00:55:01.478 --> 00:55:03.767
What the hell? 
I could test her.

831
00:55:04.731 --> 00:55:06.688
I could make an advance.

832
00:55:06.733 --> 00:55:09.058
What could possibly go wrong?

833
00:55:10.153 --> 00:55:12.229
- Don't!
- It was meant to be.


834
00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.818
Take your hands off me.
Are you crazy?


835
00:55:14.866 --> 00:55:19.029
- Linda, my love.
- I'm a married woman. Rape!


836
00:55:19.078 --> 00:55:21.367
Let's not get carried away.

837
00:55:21.414 --> 00:55:23.490
I'm not an appealing guy.

838
00:55:24.542 --> 00:55:27.459
The thought that
Linda could fall for me,


839
00:55:27.503 --> 00:55:29.792
I'm kidding myself.

840
00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:32.412
Where the hell is she anyhow?

841
00:55:32.466 --> 00:55:36.416
By now she could have had her steak
and been out of here.


842
00:55:41.683 --> 00:55:46.012
I feel so light, that lithium
I took today is really working.


843
00:55:46.062 --> 00:55:49.348
Maybe you'd better not
have any champagne.


844
00:55:49.399 --> 00:55:53.610
No, if I get carried away,
you can always call the police.


845
00:55:53.653 --> 00:55:57.069
- How long is Dick away for?
- He's back tomorrow.


846
00:55:57.115 --> 00:56:00.281
There's a new Truffaut film,
we should go see it.


847
00:56:00.326 --> 00:56:02.484
Come on, we're all set for here.

848
00:56:02.536 --> 00:56:07.578
Besides, it's starting to rain
and that great lda Lupino movie's on.


849
00:56:07.625 --> 00:56:12.500
She's married but gets involved
with her husband's best friend.


850
00:56:12.546 --> 00:56:15.463
- How does it end?
- She kills the men.


851
00:56:15.507 --> 00:56:19.374
- Let's go out.
- No, I really want to see the movie.


852
00:56:19.428 --> 00:56:24.932
It's a fascinating theme. Do you think it
is possible to love two people at once?


853
00:56:24.974 --> 00:56:28.094
- What do you mean?
- A wife, happily married,


854
00:56:28.144 --> 00:56:30.849
suddenly finds she loves another man.

855
00:56:30.897 --> 00:56:35.724
Not that she doesn't love her husband
just that she loves somebody else.


856
00:56:35.776 --> 00:56:37.852
Do you think that's possible?

857
00:56:37.903 --> 00:56:39.979
- Do you?
- Very.


858
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:42.984
Very possible
and probably very common.


859
00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:45.441
Love is such a strange phenomenon.

860
00:56:45.494 --> 00:56:47.617
Strange and exquisite.

861
00:56:48.163 --> 00:56:51.164
- Go ahead, make your move.
- No, I can't.


862
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:53.699
- Take her and kiss her.
- Is anything wrong?


863
00:56:53.752 --> 00:56:57.702
She wants it. Hurry,
before she moves out of position.


864
00:56:57.756 --> 00:57:00.543
- Kiss her, kid.
- I'll do the potatoes.


865
00:57:02.177 --> 00:57:04.964
Well, kid, you blew it.

866
00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:08.131
I can't do it.

867
00:57:08.182 --> 00:57:12.810
How's it look? I invite her over
and come on like a sex degenerate.


868
00:57:12.854 --> 00:57:16.934
You're getting carried away.
You think too much, just do it.


869
00:57:16.983 --> 00:57:19.059
We're platonic friends.

870
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:22.728
I can't spoil that by coming on.
She'll slap my face.


871
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:25.022
I've had my face slapped plenty.

872
00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:27.612
But your glasses
don't go flying across the room.


873
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.700
- You're gonna disappoint her.
- I can't.


874
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:34.660
Here we are, you can start on this.

875
00:57:35.376 --> 00:57:38.875
Did you read that another
Oakland woman was raped?


876
00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:41.708
I was nowhere near Oakland!

877
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.963
- Do they know who did it?
- No idea. He must be very clever.


878
00:57:47.012 --> 00:57:50.796
You must be on the ball to rape
so many women and get away with it.


879
00:57:50.849 --> 00:57:55.178
If anybody tried to rape me,
I'd just pretend to go along with it


880
00:57:55.228 --> 00:57:58.514
and then grab a heavy object
and let him have it.


881
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.938
That is unless I was enjoying it.

882
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.318
They say it's every woman's
secret desire.


883
00:58:08.366 --> 00:58:11.450
I guess it depends on
who's doing the raping.


884
00:58:12.495 --> 00:58:16.575
Why dwell on morbid subjects?
Odds are you'll never get raped.


885
00:58:16.624 --> 00:58:18.700
Not with my luck.

886
00:58:20.794 --> 00:58:23.000
I feel so light.

887
00:58:23.046 --> 00:58:26.830
That drink is going right to my head.
I'm floating.


888
00:58:26.883 --> 00:58:29.255
- Go ahead, kiss her.
- I can't.


889
00:58:29.302 --> 00:58:31.758
- She's ready.
- How can you be sure?


890
00:58:31.805 --> 00:58:34.805
- Believe me, I'm sure.
- She'll pull back.


891
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:38.300
She's sitting and waiting.
Now, don't screw up.


892
00:58:40.104 --> 00:58:42.678
Right, I'll try but I'm gonna go slow.

893
00:58:42.732 --> 00:58:45.898
If she screams,
I'll pretend it was a joke.


894
00:58:45.943 --> 00:58:48.019
She'd better laugh.

895
00:58:50.197 --> 00:58:52.273
The phone!

896
00:58:56.411 --> 00:58:58.285
Yes, she's here.

897
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:02.244
She came over before.
I was going out, I had a Polish date.


898
00:59:02.292 --> 00:59:05.209
It's for you, it's from Cleveland.

899
00:59:05.253 --> 00:59:07.661
- Are you upset?
- The ring startled me.


900
00:59:07.714 --> 00:59:11.047
I want her out, I'm gonna cause
an international incident!


901
00:59:11.092 --> 00:59:14.841
- Hello, darling.
- She loves him. I'm kidding myself.


902
00:59:14.887 --> 00:59:19.514
Relax. You're as nervous as Elizabeth
Scott was before I blew her brains out.


903
00:59:19.559 --> 00:59:22.512
All you got to
do is make your move.

904
00:59:22.561 --> 00:59:26.606
This is crazy. We'll all wind up
in The National Enquirer.


905
00:59:26.649 --> 00:59:28.855
OK, goodbye.

906
00:59:28.901 --> 00:59:30.858
Yes, I will.

907
00:59:31.862 --> 00:59:36.358
Dick sounded down. I think
he's having trouble in Cleveland.


908
00:59:36.408 --> 00:59:39.611
How come he never takes you
with him on these trips?


909
00:59:39.661 --> 00:59:43.445
I'm afraid to fly.
My analyst says it's an excuse.


910
00:59:43.498 --> 00:59:45.740
He never asks me along, though.

911
00:59:45.792 --> 00:59:48.828
Maybe he's got something
going on the side.


912
00:59:48.878 --> 00:59:52.745
- Would that bother you?
- Sure. But not if I didn't know.


913
00:59:52.799 --> 00:59:57.793
I know it'd hurt Dick if you ever
had a casual affair with anyone.


914
00:59:57.845 --> 01:00:01.130
I don't think I could
have a casual affair.


915
01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:03.886
No, I don't take those things lightly.

916
01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:07.979
If I fell for another man,
it'd have to be more than just a fling.


917
01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.639
I'd have feel something more serious.
Are you shaking?


918
01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:13.565
Just chilly.

919
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.101
It's not very cold.

920
01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:19.155
Anyway, I'm not the type for an affair.

921
01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:21.690
I couldn't take the excitement.

922
01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:24.150
Besides, I'm not glamorous enough.

923
01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:26.445
You're uncommonly beautiful.

924
01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:29.913
When I go out with you
and all those beautiful girls,


925
01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:32.165
I feel like life has passed me by.

926
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.832
I should be selling chocolate
at Fannie Farmer.


927
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.371
Those girls are not in your league.

928
01:00:37.424 --> 01:00:42.466
Keep talking, you're saving my life.
I have such an inferiority complex.


929
01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:45.549
You're doing very well.
Now kiss her.


930
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:48.600
- Please!
- You built up to it beautifully.


931
01:00:48.643 --> 01:00:52.308
- I don't have the nerve.
- Tell her she's beautiful.


932
01:00:52.355 --> 01:00:55.440
- I just told her.
- Again.


933
01:00:55.483 --> 01:00:58.817
You really are
an unusually beautiful person.


934
01:00:58.862 --> 01:01:03.357
- I don't know what to say...
- You're exceptionally beautiful.


935
01:01:03.408 --> 01:01:06.492
You're uncommonly beautiful,
unusually beautiful...


936
01:01:06.536 --> 01:01:08.694
All right!

937
01:01:08.746 --> 01:01:11.663
It's been so long since
anybody said that.


938
01:01:11.707 --> 01:01:14.624
- Move closer to her.
- How close?


939
01:01:14.668 --> 01:01:16.744
The length of your lips.

940
01:01:16.795 --> 01:01:20.164
- That's very close.
- Come on, move.


941
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.054
Now what?

942
01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:33.974
Tell her that she moves something
in you that you can't control.


943
01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.309
- You're kidding!
- Go ahead.


944
01:01:36.356 --> 01:01:38.562
- It's corny.
- She'll love it.


945
01:01:38.608 --> 01:01:41.312
Fred Astaire looks great in tails, I don't.

946
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.314
Leave Fred Astaire out of this
and say something.


947
01:01:44.363 --> 01:01:47.483
- I've loved our time together.
- So have l.


948
01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:50.202
All right? I don't
want to use your line.

949
01:01:50.244 --> 01:01:52.486
You're doing fine, kid.

950
01:01:52.538 --> 01:01:57.246
Now, tell her she has the most
irresistible eyes you've ever seen.


951
01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:03.756
You have the most eyes
I've ever seen on any person.


952
01:02:03.798 --> 01:02:06.170
- Your...
- Your hand is trembling.


953
01:02:06.217 --> 01:02:08.887
- That's because you're near.
- Pardon?


954
01:02:08.928 --> 01:02:11.004
Tell her that!

955
01:02:12.557 --> 01:02:14.763
That's because you're near.

956
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:17.514
You really know what to say,
don't you?


957
01:02:17.562 --> 01:02:20.562
Now, tell her
that you've met a lot of dames


958
01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:24.022
but she is really something special.

959
01:02:24.068 --> 01:02:26.855
- That she won't believe.
- Oh, no?


960
01:02:29.531 --> 01:02:32.236
I have met a lot of dames

961
01:02:32.284 --> 01:02:35.902
but you are really something special.

962
01:02:35.954 --> 01:02:37.199
Really?

963
01:02:37.247 --> 01:02:39.453
She bought it!

964
01:02:42.585 --> 01:02:46.797
Put your right hand around
her shoulders and pull her close.


965
01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:48.962
- I can't.
- Go on!


966
01:02:49.008 --> 01:02:51.084
I'll try.

967
01:02:54.388 --> 01:02:59.383
Now, get ready for the big move
and do exactly as I tell you.


968
01:02:59.435 --> 01:03:02.851
I warned you
to leave my ex-husband alone.


969
01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:13.479
I guess I better fix the steaks.

970
01:03:16.869 --> 01:03:18.945
Your eyes...

971
01:03:20.206 --> 01:03:22.364
are like two thick steaks.

972
01:03:22.416 --> 01:03:24.207
Don't!

973
01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:27.287
- I'll pay for the lamp.
- I think I love you.


974
01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:29.745
No, I insist on paying for the lamp.

975
01:03:29.798 --> 01:03:33.712
- Forget the lamp.
- I'm so clumsy. Take $10.


976
01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.509
Forget the damn lamp.
Give me $5, we'll call it even.


977
01:03:37.555 --> 01:03:40.046
- Don't!
- You're making a mistake.


978
01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.845
I was joking. I was just testing you.
It was a platonic kiss.


979
01:03:44.896 --> 01:03:48.763
- I think I'd better go home.
- You're making a mistake.


980
01:03:48.816 --> 01:03:51.651
- I should go.
- If you think I would...


981
01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.733
Allan, I'll be fine.

982
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:59.359
I attacked her.
I'm a vicious jungle beast.


983
01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:03.241
She's panicky. When she gets home,
she'll be hysterical.


984
01:04:03.288 --> 01:04:07.416
What am I gonna tell Dick?
She'll probably go to the police.


985
01:04:07.459 --> 01:04:10.662
What did I do?
I'm not Bogart, I never will be.


986
01:04:10.712 --> 01:04:12.669
I'm a disgrace to my sex.

987
01:04:12.714 --> 01:04:16.842
I should get a job at an Arabian palace
as a eunuch.


988
01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:19.007
That's the vice squad.

989
01:04:20.972 --> 01:04:23.260
Did you say you loved me?

990
01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:55.537
I still can't believe it.

991
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:59.045
I haven't slept that well in years.

992
01:05:00.593 --> 01:05:02.751
Is it noon yet?

993
01:05:02.803 --> 01:05:04.760
No, it's seven.

994
01:05:04.805 --> 01:05:06.679
Seven?

995
01:05:07.558 --> 01:05:09.847
I didn't realise it was so early.

996
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:14.804
- You were fantastic last night in bed.
- Thanks.


997
01:05:15.899 --> 01:05:19.897
- How do you feel now?
- I think the Pepto-Bismol helped.


998
01:05:20.987 --> 01:05:24.736
What were you thinking about
while we were doing it?


999
01:05:24.783 --> 01:05:26.526
Willie Mays.

1000
01:05:26.576 --> 01:05:29.909
You always think of baseball players
when you make love?


1001
01:05:29.954 --> 01:05:31.828
It keeps me going.

1002
01:05:31.873 --> 01:05:35.822
I couldn't figure out
why you kept yelling "slide".


1003
01:05:40.005 --> 01:05:42.793
It'll probably be best if you told Dick.

1004
01:05:42.842 --> 01:05:44.917
What'll I say?

1005
01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:50.472
It could happen and it happened.
It's not your fault or my fault.


1006
01:05:50.516 --> 01:05:54.015
You felt like a woman last night
and I felt like a man.


1007
01:05:54.061 --> 01:05:57.476
And that's what
those kind of people do.


1008
01:05:57.522 --> 01:06:02.682
But we can't sneak around
and have an affair. It's so cheap.


1009
01:06:02.735 --> 01:06:06.151
You know,
you've got to be honest with him.


1010
01:06:06.197 --> 01:06:10.658
You just have to tell him
the two of you have grown apart


1011
01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:13.073
and you and I have fallen in love.

1012
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.362
- That's if you love me.
- I do.


1013
01:06:15.414 --> 01:06:17.656
Then we have to tell him the truth.

1014
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.582
I'm so tense.

1015
01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:22.995
I can tell him.
I've known him longer than you have.


1016
01:06:23.047 --> 01:06:26.629
- No, I'd prefer to do it.
- Maybe you'd better do it.


1017
01:06:26.675 --> 01:06:28.549
Tell him what?

1018
01:06:28.593 --> 01:06:32.176
Tell him that the two of us
are right for each other


1019
01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:37.263
and that may be he ought to think
about getting his stuff and moving out.


1020
01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:39.801
Maybe you move
in with me for a while.


1021
01:06:41.272 --> 01:06:44.226
As long as we handle this
in a mature way.


1022
01:06:44.275 --> 01:06:47.691
As long as I'm mature about it,
you're mature about it,


1023
01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:51.900
both of us are mature,
we can achieve a certain maturation


1024
01:06:51.949 --> 01:06:54.191
that guarantees maturiosity.

1025
01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:57.279
You're mature, 
Allan, and very wise.

1026
01:06:57.329 --> 01:06:59.950
The key to wiseness is maturiositude.

1027
01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:04.459
Why is it always so complicated?

1028
01:07:04.503 --> 01:07:06.579
Lean on me, baby.

1029
01:07:07.339 --> 01:07:09.415
Lean on me.

1030
01:07:27.566 --> 01:07:31.350
If you want me,
I'll be home having an anxiety attack.


1031
01:07:35.491 --> 01:07:37.567
Well, kid, she loves you.

1032
01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:41.995
Why not?
I was dynamite in bed last night.


1033
01:07:42.038 --> 01:07:46.036
That lucky girl.
I gave her my best moves.


1034
01:08:03.267 --> 01:08:07.514
Excuse me, I want to take a look
at the music box in the window.


1035
01:08:07.563 --> 01:08:11.145
There's a nice, brown,
small music box.


1036
01:08:24.245 --> 01:08:29.037
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, didn't you hear?


1037
01:08:29.083 --> 01:08:32.832
No, I was thinking about some stuff.

1038
01:08:32.879 --> 01:08:36.497
- Still daydreaming. How are you?
- OK. How are you?


1039
01:08:36.549 --> 01:08:39.882
I just got back from New York.
I'm gonna move back there.


1040
01:08:39.927 --> 01:08:41.801
Is that so?

1041
01:08:41.845 --> 01:08:43.921
I don't know what to say!

1042
01:08:43.973 --> 01:08:46.048
So, what are you doing?

1043
01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:51.015
You know, the usual.
Going to the movies and...


1044
01:08:51.063 --> 01:08:53.304
staring off into space.

1045
01:08:53.356 --> 01:08:55.682
Are you seeing someone?

1046
01:08:58.111 --> 01:09:00.234
I mean, I go out but...

1047
01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.438
How are Dick and Linda?

1048
01:09:03.074 --> 01:09:06.241
She's fine. Just... 
I wouldn't know.

1049
01:09:07.328 --> 01:09:10.163
You're in better spirits than when I left.

1050
01:09:10.206 --> 01:09:12.828
I am. You got me on an up-day.

1051
01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:15.367
Is this the music box you wanted?

1052
01:09:16.338 --> 01:09:18.211
It's pretty.

1053
01:09:19.341 --> 01:09:23.967
I need to keep my paperclips
in something so... You know?


1054
01:09:24.012 --> 01:09:27.262
I have an appointment
with the diet doctor.


1055
01:09:27.306 --> 01:09:29.595
You don't seem overweight to me.

1056
01:09:29.642 --> 01:09:32.180
Let's not have that argument again.

1057
01:09:32.228 --> 01:09:33.971
Right.

1058
01:09:35.064 --> 01:09:38.764
- Bye.
- So long. It was nice seeing you.


1059
01:09:38.817 --> 01:09:40.893
Thanks. You, too.

1060
01:09:43.906 --> 01:09:46.693
I was real cool.

1061
01:09:46.742 --> 01:09:49.149
Why not? She never understood me.

1062
01:09:49.202 --> 01:09:53.947
I'm complicated.
I think Linda understands that.


1063
01:09:53.999 --> 01:09:56.075
Linda finds me exciting.

1064
01:09:56.126 --> 01:09:57.999
Dick'll understand.

1065
01:09:58.044 --> 01:10:01.413
Because of our social encounters
a romance has developed.


1066
01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:04.465
It's natural
among sophisticated people.


1067
01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:07.720
- You sent for me?
- Yes. Drink? Scotch?


1068
01:10:07.762 --> 01:10:10.632
- Fine.
- Soda? Linda and I are in love.


1069
01:10:10.681 --> 01:10:13.967
Just as well. My doctor says
I have two months to live.


1070
01:10:14.018 --> 01:10:16.805
- Good. Then you don't mind?
- Not a bit.


1071
01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:21.022
Dick and I have been through
a lot together.


1072
01:10:21.066 --> 01:10:26.107
He's my best friend. This is terrible.
This is gonna hurt him, I know it.


1073
01:10:26.154 --> 01:10:30.152
How could they?
My wife and my best friend.


1074
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.525
I loved her. And I loved him.

1075
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.027
Why didn't I see it coming?

1076
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.414
Me, who had the foresight
to by Polaroid at 8.5.


1077
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.496
Dick is an emotional guy.

1078
01:10:44.547 --> 01:10:48.710
He's liable to... God knows what?
Kill himself or something.


1079
01:10:48.759 --> 01:10:51.511
Kill himself?
What might he do to you?


1080
01:10:51.553 --> 01:10:55.136
You take a guy's wife,
you humiliate him...


1081
01:10:55.182 --> 01:10:59.642
You've seen enough ltalian movies.
And Dick's got a temper.


1082
01:11:42.185 --> 01:11:44.640
You're supposed to be in Cleveland.

1083
01:11:44.687 --> 01:11:47.439
I had to come home.
I got to talk to you.


1084
01:11:49.692 --> 01:11:51.768
I got a problem.

1085
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.903
What do you mean?

1086
01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:02.032
I think Linda's having an affair.

1087
01:12:03.122 --> 01:12:05.695
I called her at home, she's not there.

1088
01:12:05.749 --> 01:12:08.916
Recently, she's been distant,
distracted.


1089
01:12:08.961 --> 01:12:12.127
Little things
only a husband would notice.


1090
01:12:12.172 --> 01:12:16.999
I don't understand it. You've seen her
a lot lately, she's changed.


1091
01:12:17.052 --> 01:12:21.548
The other night she spoke
about having an affair in her sleep.


1092
01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:24.801
- Did she mention any names?
- Only yours.


1093
01:12:24.851 --> 01:12:28.599
When I woke her,
she said it was just a nightmare.


1094
01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:35.819
I keep trying to think
of who it could be.


1095
01:12:35.861 --> 01:12:40.322
It's got to be someone I don't know,
someone she met through work.


1096
01:12:40.365 --> 01:12:45.704
An agent or ad executive,
a photographer, maybe an actor.


1097
01:12:45.746 --> 01:12:47.987
- Don't get upset.
- I love her.


1098
01:12:48.039 --> 01:12:50.447
If she leaves me, 
I'll kill myself.

1099
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.872
Since when are you so emotional?

1100
01:12:52.919 --> 01:12:56.086
I've never been in love with
anyone before.


1101
01:12:56.131 --> 01:12:59.665
If I find out who the
guy is, I'll kill him.


1102
01:12:59.717 --> 01:13:03.881
I've neglected her and
now she's involved with some stud.


1103
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:08.508
If I haven't already lost her,
I'm really gonna make it up to her.


1104
01:13:08.559 --> 01:13:10.765
I'm gonna change.

1105
01:13:10.811 --> 01:13:14.227
I'm gonna make her life with me
fun and exciting


1106
01:13:14.273 --> 01:13:17.357
cos without her,
it wouldn't be worth living.


1107
01:13:17.401 --> 01:13:22.359
I was up all night thinking,
"I'm losing her. Too bad, I'll survive."


1108
01:13:22.406 --> 01:13:25.656
Then I panicked and called her.
She was out.


1109
01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.238
Where the hell did she stay?

1110
01:13:28.286 --> 01:13:31.240
- Calm yourself.
- I've got to find her.


1111
01:13:31.289 --> 01:13:34.907
I've got to beg her forgiveness
before it's too late.


1112
01:13:34.959 --> 01:13:39.039
I want her to get on that plane with me
back to Cleveland.


1113
01:13:39.088 --> 01:13:41.757
I want to hear her laugh and speak.

1114
01:13:41.799 --> 01:13:44.504
I want to pamper her,
take care of her.


1115
01:13:46.637 --> 01:13:48.713
Sorry for carrying on like this

1116
01:13:48.764 --> 01:13:51.800
but you're the only friend
who'd understand.


1117
01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:53.724
I understand.

1118
01:13:53.769 --> 01:13:58.976
Look, Allan, if she calls,
will you tell her I've got to talk to her?


1119
01:13:59.024 --> 01:14:01.230
Tell her I'll see her at home.

1120
01:14:01.276 --> 01:14:03.814
- OK, I'll tell her.
- Thanks.


1121
01:14:05.613 --> 01:14:06.645
Thanks a lot.

1122
01:14:18.959 --> 01:14:23.123
How can I break up his home?
He's crazy about her.


1123
01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:26.920
I never realised how much.
He never realised how much.


1124
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:37.175
Hello, Linda?

1125
01:14:37.227 --> 01:14:40.761
I'm in the middle of a conversation.
I'll call you back.


1126
01:14:41.731 --> 01:14:43.605
Don't...

1127
01:14:50.239 --> 01:14:52.315
So that's really it?

1128
01:14:54.702 --> 01:14:59.198
Linda, I have to speak to you.
Have you told him anything yet?


1129
01:14:59.248 --> 01:15:02.202
- Who is that? ls that him?
- This is Allan.


1130
01:15:02.251 --> 01:15:05.785
- Allan, I'll speak to you later.
- Don't hang up!


1131
01:15:22.688 --> 01:15:26.685
Listen, this is urgent...
You sound terrible.


1132
01:15:29.319 --> 01:15:31.193
Excuse me.

1133
01:15:33.073 --> 01:15:35.149
That wasn't her.

1134
01:15:36.701 --> 01:15:39.406
I just hope you know
what you're doing.


1135
01:15:42.582 --> 01:15:45.951
Is it all right? ls the coast clear?
Can I speak?


1136
01:15:47.253 --> 01:15:51.085
- I ought to be in Cleveland.
- No, wait.


1137
01:15:52.174 --> 01:15:54.582
Say... Just answer in...

1138
01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.503
I'll speak to you later.

1139
01:16:00.182 --> 01:16:02.424
I don't believe this.

1140
01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:06.810
The airport.

1141
01:16:06.855 --> 01:16:11.018
I've got to speak to her
before she says anything to him.


1142
01:16:16.364 --> 01:16:20.112
- The Christies just left for the airport.
- Together?


1143
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:22.235
One right after the other.

1144
01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:24.243
Taxi!

1145
01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:30.913
I'll tell her it's over, that's all.
It was fun but we lost our heads.


1146
01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:36.090
What if it's too late?
What if Linda's really hooked on me?


1147
01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:41.670
Once a woman's been made love to
by somebody who can do it great...


1148
01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.880
I was incredible last night in bed.

1149
01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:49.218
I never once had to sit up
and consult the manual.


1150
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:53.434
Love is very different for a woman,
it's a complicated phenomenon.


1151
01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:56.353
I've never broken off with a girl before.

1152
01:16:56.402 --> 01:16:59.320
- You said you loved me.
- Take it gracefully.


1153
01:16:59.363 --> 01:17:03.064
But the time we've spent together,
the closeness.


1154
01:17:03.117 --> 01:17:05.987
You mean too much to me,
I can't let you go.


1155
01:17:06.036 --> 01:17:10.034
- I 'm sorry.
- Sorry? You think I'm some play-toy?


1156
01:17:10.082 --> 01:17:12.703
- What can I say?
- Give me the letter.


1157
01:17:12.751 --> 01:17:14.827
- What?
- Give me the letter.


1158
01:17:14.878 --> 01:17:17.084
- There is no letter.
- I want it.


1159
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:22.088
You're going crazy.
Don't pull the trigger. I'm a bleeder!


1160
01:17:23.094 --> 01:17:27.756
Pull yourself together, kid.
You should feel encouraged.


1161
01:17:27.807 --> 01:17:31.472
When you weren't being phoney,
you got a good dame to fall for you.


1162
01:17:31.519 --> 01:17:34.271
You thought
you couldn't make it with dames.


1163
01:17:34.313 --> 01:17:39.271
- And now I've got to end it.
- It's not that hard, kid. Watch.


1164
01:17:48.869 --> 01:17:51.905
- Come here, sweetheart.
- Yes, darling?


1165
01:17:52.831 --> 01:17:55.037
- It's over.
- What is?


1166
01:17:55.083 --> 01:17:56.957
- Us.
- Over?


1167
01:17:57.002 --> 01:17:59.208
- Over. Kaput.
- That simple?


1168
01:17:59.254 --> 01:18:01.827
- That's right.
- Supposing I say no?


1169
01:18:01.881 --> 01:18:04.752
- Won't do you any good.
- And will this?


1170
01:18:04.801 --> 01:18:08.004
Come off it, sugar.
You never could use a rod.


1171
01:18:09.972 --> 01:18:13.092
But why does it have to end
before it can begin?


1172
01:18:13.142 --> 01:18:15.384
Because you play too rough for me.

1173
01:18:15.436 --> 01:18:19.350
You killed Johnson.
Parker found out so you killed him too.


1174
01:18:19.398 --> 01:18:21.640
Then you wanted to finish me off.

1175
01:18:21.692 --> 01:18:26.567
You couldn't do it when I was facing
you so you wanted me to turn around.


1176
01:18:26.613 --> 01:18:30.231
Now, let's go. 
You're taking the fall.

1177
01:18:38.291 --> 01:18:40.533
That's all there is to it.

1178
01:18:40.585 --> 01:18:42.873
For you because you're Bogart.

1179
01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.127
Everybody is at certain times.

1180
01:18:45.173 --> 01:18:48.173
You're doing something
I didn't think you could.


1181
01:18:48.217 --> 01:18:51.965
You're passing up a real tomato
because you don't want to hurt a guy.


1182
01:18:52.012 --> 01:18:55.179
If I did that,
there wouldn't be a dry eye.


1183
01:18:55.224 --> 01:18:57.263
But I'm heartbroken over it.

1184
01:18:57.309 --> 01:18:59.800
All the more reason
to feel proud of it.

1185
01:18:59.853 --> 01:19:01.929
- You think so?
- Sure.


1186
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:06.725
Listen, kid, there's other things
in life besides dames.


1187
01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:10.691
One of them is to know
you did the right thing for a pal.


1188
01:19:10.739 --> 01:19:12.814
Think it over.

1189
01:19:42.769 --> 01:19:46.601
- What gate is the flight to Cleveland?
- Gate 15.


1190
01:19:54.363 --> 01:19:57.317
- Where's the plane to Cleveland?
- Gate 15.


1191
01:20:17.219 --> 01:20:19.544
- Wait.
- What are you doing here?


1192
01:20:19.596 --> 01:20:23.178
- I've something important to tell you.
- So do l.


1193
01:20:23.224 --> 01:20:26.842
Do you realise what a wonderful thing
has happened?


1194
01:20:26.894 --> 01:20:31.188
The most beautiful thing has
happened right under our noses.


1195
01:20:31.232 --> 01:20:35.561
We've had a wonderful experience.
Doesn't that surprise you?


1196
01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:39.229
You didn't have to leave books
lying around,


1197
01:20:39.281 --> 01:20:41.986
you didn't have to have on
the proper music.


1198
01:20:42.034 --> 01:20:46.612
I even saw you in your underwear
with the days of the week on them.


1199
01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:50.331
- We have to call it quits.
- Yes, I know.


1200
01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:53.874
- Pardon me?
- Suddenly things became very clear.


1201
01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:58.582
And when I asked myself if I really
wanted to break off my marriage,


1202
01:20:58.633 --> 01:21:02.216
the answer was no. I love Dick.

1203
01:21:03.262 --> 01:21:07.046
Although someone
as wonderful as you is very tempting,


1204
01:21:07.099 --> 01:21:10.266
- I can't imagine life without him.
- You can't?


1205
01:21:10.311 --> 01:21:16.184
He needs me. In some
unexplainable way, I need him.


1206
01:21:16.234 --> 01:21:18.310
I know he needs you.

1207
01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:22.690
This is the first time I've been affected
by anyone besides Dick.


1208
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.065
I'm already in love with you.

1209
01:21:25.118 --> 01:21:29.329
Unless we stop now,
I won't be able to go back to him.


1210
01:21:29.372 --> 01:21:32.408
I don't regret a moment
of what's happened


1211
01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:36.954
because it's reaffirmed
my feelings for Dick.


1212
01:21:40.174 --> 01:21:42.250
Linda, I understand, really.

1213
01:21:42.301 --> 01:21:46.001
Sure? You're not just saying that
to make things easy?


1214
01:21:46.054 --> 01:21:48.261
I'm saying it because it's true.

1215
01:21:48.306 --> 01:21:52.221
We both know you belong to Dick.
You're part of his work.


1216
01:21:52.269 --> 01:21:55.518
If that plane leaves and you don't,
you'll regret it.


1217
01:21:55.563 --> 01:22:00.355
Maybe not today or tomorrow
but soon and for the rest of your life.


1218
01:22:00.401 --> 01:22:02.275
That's beautiful.

1219
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.526
It's from Casablanca.

1220
01:22:04.572 --> 01:22:07.145
I waited my whole life to say it.

1221
01:22:17.793 --> 01:22:20.877
I thought I saw you here.
What's going on?


1222
01:22:20.921 --> 01:22:23.957
You should know something
before you two leave.


1223
01:22:24.007 --> 01:22:26.712
Us? You're coming with me?

1224
01:22:28.094 --> 01:22:30.716
Nobody owes me any explanations.

1225
01:22:30.764 --> 01:22:34.464
I'm going to anyway because
it may mean something later on.


1226
01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:37.850
You said you thought Linda
was having an affair.


1227
01:22:37.895 --> 01:22:40.932
But she was at my house
when you called.


1228
01:22:40.982 --> 01:22:45.560
She came over to baby-sit with me
because I was lonely. Right?


1229
01:22:47.279 --> 01:22:50.446
Over the past weeks
I've fallen in love with her.


1230
01:22:50.491 --> 01:22:55.283
I hoped she felt the same way
but all she could talk about was you.


1231
01:22:55.329 --> 01:22:58.662
- I understand, Allan.
- I hope you do.


1232
01:23:13.096 --> 01:23:15.302
We better be going.

1233
01:23:23.272 --> 01:23:25.348
I'll call you, Allan.

1234
01:23:39.704 --> 01:23:41.780
That was great.

1235
01:23:41.831 --> 01:23:45.247
You've really developed yourself
a little style.


1236
01:23:45.293 --> 01:23:48.413
I do have a certain amount of style,
don't l?


1237
01:23:49.505 --> 01:23:52.376
I guess you won't be needing me
any more.


1238
01:23:52.425 --> 01:23:56.921
There's nothing I can tell you now
that you don't already know.


1239
01:23:56.971 --> 01:24:01.597
I guess that's so. I guess the secret's
not being you, it's being me.


1240
01:24:01.642 --> 01:24:04.393
True, you're not too tall and kinda ugly

1241
01:24:04.436 --> 01:24:09.643
but I'm short enough and ugly enough
to succeed on my own.


1242
01:24:11.985 --> 01:24:14.274
Here's looking at you, kid.
