1
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.378
Okay, let's do it.

2
00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:31.563
10-4, 20 William 12.

3
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.483
We have you eastbound,
in pursuit of tanker truck.


4
00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:36.485
Backup is available.

5
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.612
Air Unit 3 is in the area.

6
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.989
I see him, but
I can handle this myself.

7
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.492
This is Air Unit 3. Forget it, Tango.

8
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.619
We'll take it from here. Drop back.

9
00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:49.164
Drop dead. I've been on this case
for three months. I'm going around.


10
00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:15.357
We're out of our jurisdiction, Tango.
County sheriff and CHP are on the way.


11
00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:17.734
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

12
00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.194
And good luck.

13
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.654
Thanks. Over.

14
00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.914
- Jesus!
- Shit!


15
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:20.005
This guy's crazy!

16
00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.262
Shit!

17
00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:29.598
Jesus!

18
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.945
Glad you could drop in.

19
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:45.781
You like jewelry?

20
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:48.075
Fuck you!

21
00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:49.368
I prefer blonds.

22
00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:53.163
Do the honors.

23
00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:25.570
- Ray.
- Hey, captain.


24
00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:26.988
What the hell's going on here?

25
00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:28.907
Just letting the locals do their thing.

26
00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.867
- You blew out the truck window.
- I noticed.


27
00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.286
- Two guys are in the road.
- I noticed.


28
00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.997
- We're out of our jurisdiction here.
- That's true.


29
00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.625
- What the hell's going on?
- I heard a rumor about this truck.


30
00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:40.877
- What about this truck?
- It's not a truck.


31
00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:43.004
- It's a gas truck.
- No.


32
00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:45.924
It's a major moving violation.

33
00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:50.387
- Did you check the first panel?
- It's full of gas, sir.


34
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.640
We checked the whole truck, asshole!
There's nothing in it!


35
00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:56.393
And you're out of your neighborhood,
big city boy!


36
00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:59.438
I want your badge! I want your weapon!
I want your ass!


37
00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.189
Who in the fuck
do you think you are?!

38
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:02.858
He thinks he's Rambo.

39
00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:06.027
Rambo...

40
00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:07.696
...is a pussy.

41
00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:16.288
What do you know, it's snowing!

42
00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:26.965
Anybody want to get high?

43
00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:28.884
I'll be damned!

44
00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:32.220
Not bad for a city guy.

45
00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:40.020
Ray Tango.

46
00:04:40.188 --> 00:04:42.397
He's done it to us again.

47
00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:44.357
If it isn't Tango, it's Cash.

48
00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.235
Tango and Cash! 
Cash and Tango!

49
00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:50.113
These two cops are driving me crazy.

50
00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:52.407
We have to do something about this.

51
00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:56.953
I agree. I would like to handle
this myself, Mr. Perret.


52
00:04:57.121 --> 00:04:59.247
No, we will handle it.

53
00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.916
No.

54
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.418
Not that way.

55
00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:07.923
I have something else in mind.

56
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:20.393
Hey, Cash!

57
00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:56.054
Well, if it isn't Armani with a badge.

58
00:07:02.747 --> 00:07:03.997
Look out!

59
00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:14.924
Police business!

60
00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:16.718
Hey! This is my car!

61
00:07:16.927 --> 00:07:18.094
Move!

62
00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:29.898
What are you doing to my car?!

63
00:07:57.301 --> 00:07:58.426
Son of a bitch!

64
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:41.511
What's the matter, ace?
Got a little headache?


65
00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:43.346
You crazy guy!

66
00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:45.890
What did you do with my car?!

67
00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:47.809
I believe in perestroika!

68
00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.895
Welcome to America!

69
00:09:02.616 --> 00:09:05.410
Hey, Tango, I saw
your picture in the paper.

70
00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.621
- Nice suit.
Thanks. Morning.


71
00:09:13.043 --> 00:09:15.044
- Hey, Ray? Look at this.
- Yeah.


72
00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.630
Blind luck.

73
00:09:17.798 --> 00:09:18.840
Hey, Ray.
- Yeah.


74
00:09:19.008 --> 00:09:21.843
- Catherine's in your office.
- Ah, that's great.


75
00:09:23.137 --> 00:09:25.263
Catherine, you just don't take off...

76
00:09:25.556 --> 00:09:27.265
...on the spur of the moment. It's...

77
00:09:27.516 --> 00:09:29.350
What? Illogical?

78
00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:31.186
- Very!
- It's not that big a deal.


79
00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:33.021
I'll be gone a month or two.

80
00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:35.523
It takes that long to build a house,
not take a vacation.


81
00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:40.361
A dance tour is not a vacation!
And besides, I just wanna get away.


82
00:09:40.654 --> 00:09:43.031
You got everything you need
right here in this town.


83
00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:44.699
Grime, crime and slime.

84
00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:46.785
No, thanks.
I'd really rather be out of here.


85
00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:50.872
Okay, then at least let me have
the phone numbers where I can reach you.


86
00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:53.750
Why don't I just call you?

87
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.878
Why don't you just call me?

88
00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:06.304
Catherine, if you're feeling stressed,
don't run away.


89
00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.723
Stay here and we can
deal with this together.


90
00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:10.391
Don't make me feel guilty.

91
00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.561
I just feel like I need
some time alone, okay?


92
00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:17.065
And I promise, lieutenant,
that I will be a good girl.


93
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.108
There it is!

94
00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.069
The key word.

95
00:10:21.612 --> 00:10:22.779
"Good. "

96
00:10:22.947 --> 00:10:27.325
You're telling me you'll be this good girl
because you know, don't you...


97
00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:30.119
...automatically, 
I think you'll be bad.

98
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.456
- Yes?
- Hey, Ray, what's a margin call?


99
00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:35.625
- Why?
- Your stockbroker's on line 3.


100
00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:38.336
- Says it's urgent.
- This is very important. Don't leave.


101
00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.046
Yeah?

102
00:10:42.216 --> 00:10:43.466
Hold on. Catherine.

103
00:10:43.634 --> 00:10:45.426
I'm sorry, I have a plane to catch.

104
00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:47.720
Catherine, don't go.

105
00:10:48.097 --> 00:10:49.514
Think positive.

106
00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:52.433
Shit!

107
00:10:53.727 --> 00:10:55.979
Harvey, yeah. Yeah, it's me, sure.

108
00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:07.532
Good thing you wore a vest.
Hardly needed it with these.


109
00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.742
Half-load soft lead slugs.

110
00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:12.620
This guy was really sloppy.

111
00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:18.543
Oh, boy.

112
00:11:18.794 --> 00:11:20.378
Look at this, will you?

113
00:11:20.963 --> 00:11:24.507
This shirt cost me 9 bucks.
Get me a new vest, will you?


114
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.552
Whoa, whoa, whoa, pizza!

115
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.148
Who's been fucking with my gun?

116
00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:42.442
The sight's shifted on it.

117
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:45.153
- Maybe you dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.


118
00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:48.656
- Hey, captain!
Yeah, Gabe.


119
00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:50.450
You get anything out of that guy?

120
00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:54.913
Nothing, he doesn't speak any English.
Our interpreter says he wants a lawyer.


121
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.998
- Let me question him.
- Question him?


122
00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:00.793
The guy that just tried
to blow you away? Forget it!


123
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:04.005
Stay away from him, Gabe.

124
00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:15.058
Hi.

125
00:12:16.226 --> 00:12:19.062
So you don't know any English, huh?

126
00:12:19.229 --> 00:12:23.358
I don't know much Chinese, so we'll
have to give you a crash course, buddy.


127
00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:27.445
But I got a feeling you're gonna be
a real quick learner.


128
00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:31.324
Yeah, come here. Sit down.
There we go.


129
00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:34.827
All right, this is lesson number one.

130
00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:36.913
And the next lessons do get harder.

131
00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:38.706
Who hired you to kill me?

132
00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:40.875
I don't know!

133
00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:42.710
"I don't know. "

134
00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:46.547
Nope, wrong answer. Try again.

135
00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:50.468
I think he's one of Quan's men.

136
00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:53.554
I don't know his name. I swear!

137
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.890
Look at that, Flattop.

138
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.726
You're speaking like a native already.

139
00:12:58.936 --> 00:13:01.270
What is this?
- English 101.


140
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.275
Since your scumbag lawyer
won't be here for quite some time...


141
00:13:06.443 --> 00:13:08.236
...is there anything else
you wanna share?


142
00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:10.363
Think hard.

143
00:13:10.572 --> 00:13:13.449
A deal. Tonight.

144
00:13:13.867 --> 00:13:15.743
4942...

145
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.745
...Front Street. 9:00.

146
00:13:17.955 --> 00:13:19.247
Very good.

147
00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:22.750
My compliments.

148
00:13:23.127 --> 00:13:27.296
Pretty good for your first lesson.
Don't forget to wash your hands.


149
00:13:28.132 --> 00:13:30.425
Ray? Your ship's come in.

150
00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:33.094
There's a big bust going down
at 4942 Front Street.


151
00:13:33.262 --> 00:13:35.763
- Great. Is that reliable?
- Very reliable. A phone tap.


152
00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:38.224
- Fantastic.
- What the hell is this?


153
00:13:38.392 --> 00:13:41.102
Downtown clown
versus Beverly Hills wop.


154
00:13:42.438 --> 00:13:44.731
- All the news that's fit to print.
- I don't understand you.


155
00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:48.443
You make a shitload of money.
What are you doing this for?


156
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.986
- Action.
- Action?


157
00:13:50.154 --> 00:13:51.446
Good old American action.

158
00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:55.324
If you want to stare death in the eye,
you should've gotten married.


159
00:13:55.492 --> 00:13:56.993
Is that a proposal?

160
00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:33.196
Gabriel Cash.

161
00:14:33.363 --> 00:14:34.906
Oh, God.

162
00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:37.158
How many millions? How many?

163
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:39.077
How many this time?

164
00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:55.051
Oh, God!

165
00:14:55.719 --> 00:14:57.428
Ray Tango!

166
00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.388
How he loves to dance.

167
00:14:59.556 --> 00:15:02.683
He waltzes in and takes all my drugs...

168
00:15:02.893 --> 00:15:05.853
...and then Tangos back out again.

169
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:08.356
I've had enough of this.

170
00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:10.942
Too much television...

171
00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:15.029
...can hurt your eyes.

172
00:15:16.865 --> 00:15:21.160
Now... Now do you understand
why we mustn't kill them?


173
00:15:21.328 --> 00:15:23.913
No, Mr. Perret. 
I do not understand.

174
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:26.040
It would be much quicker.

175
00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:27.542
And easier.

176
00:15:29.878 --> 00:15:31.462
Quicker...

177
00:15:32.214 --> 00:15:33.589
...and easier.

178
00:15:33.882 --> 00:15:36.759
Yes, quick and easy
is how you make a cake.


179
00:15:37.052 --> 00:15:39.595
Or clean a toilet bowl, or shop...

180
00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.222
...by mail.

181
00:15:42.057 --> 00:15:46.561
But quick and easy is not how you run
a multimillion-dollar business such as ours.


182
00:15:46.728 --> 00:15:48.563
Now, Mr. Quan.

183
00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:51.232
On the east side...

184
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.569
That's your part of the city.

185
00:15:55.028 --> 00:15:57.029
- Gabriel Cash...

186
00:15:57.906 --> 00:16:00.116
...has cost me more than $60 million...

187
00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:04.245
...including guns, drugs
and various other enterprises.


188
00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:06.080
On the west side...

189
00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:07.790
...Mr. Lopez...

190
00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:11.419
...Ray Tango...

191
00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:14.088
...has cost me even more.

192
00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.342
Two little mice...

193
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.428
...and so much damage.

194
00:16:23.807 --> 00:16:25.183
But...

195
00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:31.105
...if we kill them,
we risk all-out war with the police.


196
00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:33.858
They're heroes already.

197
00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:35.818
Why make martyrs of them?

198
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.155
Instead of death...

199
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.283
...we have a game.

200
00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:44.952
A game that only we can win.

201
00:16:45.162 --> 00:16:47.914
Within two weeks...

202
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:54.629
...I will be taking delivery
of the largest shipment of weapons...


203
00:16:54.796 --> 00:16:56.464
...that we have ever handled.

204
00:16:58.091 --> 00:16:59.467
Within that time...

205
00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:05.264
...Tango...

206
00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:06.724
...and Cash...

207
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.604
...will be safely tucked away...

208
00:17:14.983 --> 00:17:17.860
...behind bars.

209
00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:26.160
Aren't they beautiful?

210
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.849
You almost got yourself killed, pal.

211
00:19:54.142 --> 00:19:55.810
I'd say it's the other way around.

212
00:19:56.019 --> 00:19:58.813
I pull this trigger,
your throat's hanging off that wall.


213
00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:01.816
You pull that trigger,
I'll blow you in half.


214
00:20:02.025 --> 00:20:04.693
You never had a chance
to hit me with that gun.


215
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:06.487
Not with this one. This one.

216
00:20:10.826 --> 00:20:13.536
- You know me, huh?
- I hear you're the second-best cop in L.A.


217
00:20:13.703 --> 00:20:15.329
I heard the same thing about you.

218
00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:17.665
- Stay off my case.
- What makes it your case?


219
00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:19.417
I've been on it for three months.

220
00:20:19.584 --> 00:20:23.921
Then you're stupid. I've been on it for half
an hour now and I'm all caught up with you.


221
00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:27.007
- Stay off my case.
- Nice tie.


222
00:20:31.304 --> 00:20:33.013
It's your bust.
How do you wanna do this?


223
00:20:33.181 --> 00:20:35.683
- I'll go first. Cover me on three.
- Okay.


224
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:37.226
One.

225
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:40.020
- Two.
- Three.


226
00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:42.523
Freak!

227
00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:44.191
What's the score, babe?

228
00:20:48.488 --> 00:20:50.948
My turn. Don't move!

229
00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:53.534
Don't move your hands.

230
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.872
I don't think his hands
are going anywhere.


231
00:21:00.917 --> 00:21:02.209
Wanna do the honors?

232
00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:09.508
He's wired.

233
00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:13.512
No, no, no. This is all wrong!

234
00:21:14.055 --> 00:21:16.724
You ought to be a cop.
Did you expect this?


235
00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:20.644
No, I didn't this,
and I didn't expect you, either.


236
00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:23.898
Why the hell is he wired?

237
00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:28.360
I don't know, but
you'll play hell getting anything out of him.


238
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.279
I'm gone. Ciao, babe.

239
00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:35.075
Drop your weapons!

240
00:21:35.285 --> 00:21:37.077
- Freeze!
- We're cops!


241
00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:41.916
Wait a minute! We're on the same team!
Just read this, goddamn it!


242
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:44.919
I'm gonna blow
both your fucking brains out!


243
00:21:46.087 --> 00:21:47.796
- No problem.
- I'm convinced.


244
00:21:48.256 --> 00:21:49.256
The man's hysterical.

245
00:21:49.424 --> 00:21:51.425
- I'd like a receipt for that.
- Yeah, me too.


246
00:21:52.427 --> 00:21:54.094
We can talk about this.

247
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.229
Christ, that's my gun.

248
00:22:04.606 --> 00:22:07.691
- What's your gun doing here?
- That's my gun, I put it in my locker.


249
00:22:07.943 --> 00:22:09.944
It's not your gun now!

250
00:22:11.905 --> 00:22:13.197
It's evidence.

251
00:22:13.448 --> 00:22:15.699
Why's your gun here?
They stole it.


252
00:22:15.951 --> 00:22:17.493
Tell me what you did.

253
00:22:18.954 --> 00:22:21.956
I don't know this man.
I didn't come with him.


254
00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:26.043
And with your permission,
I'll be leaving. Ciao.


255
00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:29.129
You may not have arrived with him,
but you're leaving with him.


256
00:22:29.422 --> 00:22:30.631
You're making a mistake.

257
00:22:30.924 --> 00:22:33.133
You're going down for this.

258
00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:38.889
Get these bastards out of here! Now!

259
00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:42.393
- You're bad karma.
- I hope you got a good lawyer.


260
00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:03.998
Perret says use this tape here.

261
00:23:12.007 --> 00:23:14.633
- Is it true Tango shot a federal officer?
- No comment.


262
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.347
- Was Detective Cash there too?
- No comment.


263
00:23:21.975 --> 00:23:23.392
What do they have?

264
00:23:23.768 --> 00:23:26.395
They got a. 380
with Cash's fingerprints.


265
00:23:26.688 --> 00:23:30.274
They think it's the murder weapon.
Ballistics is checking it.


266
00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:35.529
They were found at the scene of the crime.
Nobody else was seen coming or going.


267
00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:39.658
What else?

268
00:23:40.118 --> 00:23:41.410
Sir, tape is ready.

269
00:23:42.412 --> 00:23:43.704
What tape?

270
00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:51.003
Show us the money.
It's in the suitcase.


271
00:23:51.212 --> 00:23:52.546
Open it.
It's all there.


272
00:23:52.714 --> 00:23:54.715
- Count it if you want to.
We want to.


273
00:23:54.883 --> 00:23:56.175
Okay, where's the stuff?

274
00:23:56.426 --> 00:23:59.637
Right here. Best high for the buy.
Direct from the department lockup.


275
00:23:59.804 --> 00:24:02.723
You know, I like dealing with cops.
Why's that?


276
00:24:02.891 --> 00:24:05.726
It restores my low opinion
of human nature.


277
00:24:05.894 --> 00:24:08.646
Really? In that case, you'll love this.

278
00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:13.567
Lieutenants Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash...

279
00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:17.029
...two highly decorated officers,
go on trial today...


280
00:24:17.197 --> 00:24:20.574
...for slaying an undercover agent
during a drug-sting operation.


281
00:24:20.742 --> 00:24:22.618
Officers Tango and Cash insist...

282
00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:26.246
...they are victims of a setup,
possibly a retaliation by criminal figures...


283
00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:28.749
...aimed at taking the two top cops
out of action.


284
00:24:28.917 --> 00:24:32.086
Expert witnesses
will lead off the prosecution s case.


285
00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:34.254
Mr. Skinner, you've heard the tapes.

286
00:24:34.631 --> 00:24:37.758
If you had to make a judgment
regarding its authenticity...?


287
00:24:38.093 --> 00:24:40.761
There's no reason for me to believe
it isn't genuine.


288
00:24:41.096 --> 00:24:43.055
How did you test this tape?

289
00:24:43.264 --> 00:24:45.391
I took samples of the suspects' voices...

290
00:24:45.558 --> 00:24:49.269
...and compared them to the tape
with an oscilloscope. They matched.


291
00:24:49.437 --> 00:24:53.440
When this is over, remind me
to rip Jumbo there's tongue out.


292
00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:55.442
With a tow truck.

293
00:24:57.112 --> 00:25:00.864
When I entered the premises,
I saw the two suspects, the guns...


294
00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:04.993
...the money, the drugs, the dead body.
That's what I saw.


295
00:25:05.161 --> 00:25:06.620
When these two guys show up...

296
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.456
...I figure the whole thing's gone sour.

297
00:25:09.624 --> 00:25:12.126
So I'm gonna go in
and clear everything up...


298
00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:14.378
...when they kill him.

299
00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:18.298
When this is over, we have to pay
Jabba the Hutt here a visit.


300
00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:20.175
I'll bring the chain saw.

301
00:25:20.677 --> 00:25:21.802
I'll bring the beer.

302
00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:26.348
Detective Cash assaulted me.

303
00:25:26.641 --> 00:25:28.851
He put a chair on
my chest and sat on it.

304
00:25:29.144 --> 00:25:30.602
I couldn't find a piano.

305
00:25:33.481 --> 00:25:36.108
The son of a bitch can speak English!

306
00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:37.651
The squarecrow can talk!

307
00:25:37.819 --> 00:25:39.987
- Squarecrow?
- What would you call it?


308
00:25:40.155 --> 00:25:43.157
As the attorneys
for Tango and Cash left the courtroom...


309
00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:45.701
...their mood can only
be described as grim.


310
00:25:45.994 --> 00:25:47.536
They clearly face an uphill battle...

311
00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:49.747
...if not an impossible one.

312
00:25:53.042 --> 00:25:57.379
Ray, somebody set you up good.
I feel we should cop a plea.


313
00:25:58.047 --> 00:26:00.174
You can guarantee me minimum security?

314
00:26:00.383 --> 00:26:03.218
Absolutely. No question.
That'll be the deal.


315
00:26:03.386 --> 00:26:05.512
Is Cash's attorney
giving him the same advice?


316
00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:07.556
If he's smart, he is.

317
00:26:08.641 --> 00:26:10.559
I want to talk to Cash.

318
00:26:18.526 --> 00:26:21.195
I need to work on my
statement for the court.


319
00:26:21.362 --> 00:26:22.404
Why do you wanna see me?

320
00:26:22.572 --> 00:26:25.407
First of all, I wanna say
I'm not fond of your kind.


321
00:26:25.575 --> 00:26:27.159
Oh, really, what kind is that?

322
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.787
You're a glory hound and a hot dog.

323
00:26:29.954 --> 00:26:31.038
That stings.

324
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:33.540
Let me know when the critique is over.

325
00:26:33.708 --> 00:26:34.958
It's over.

326
00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:38.253
- My lawyer wants me to cop a plea.
- Mine too. Eighteen months.


327
00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:40.297
Lompoc Federal Country Club.

328
00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:44.051
I understand they open the gym at 5 a. m.
You can start pumping early.


329
00:26:52.393 --> 00:26:54.436
- Who do you think set us up?
- I don't know.


330
00:26:54.687 --> 00:26:56.063
I got a lot of admirers. You?

331
00:26:56.773 --> 00:26:58.190
I got a few.

332
00:26:58.775 --> 00:27:03.403
Look, if we cop a plea,
we cop it together.


333
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:08.075
I think what you're saying is your lawyer
wanted you to consider making a deal...


334
00:27:08.243 --> 00:27:11.870
...but you didn't want to leave
this glory hound holding the bag.


335
00:27:12.038 --> 00:27:14.039
Sound about right, Ray?

336
00:27:14.207 --> 00:27:15.791
- About.
- Very generous guy.


337
00:27:16.084 --> 00:27:17.793
- I'll make the statement.
- I will.


338
00:27:17.961 --> 00:27:19.294
- No way.
- Why not?


339
00:27:19.462 --> 00:27:21.129
- You'll screw it up.
- When's your birthday?


340
00:27:21.297 --> 00:27:22.840
- Why?
- When were you born?


341
00:27:23.007 --> 00:27:24.508
- Why?
- Day and month.


342
00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:27.010
- You want to do my horoscope?
- Don't give me the year.


343
00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.846
When were you born?

344
00:27:29.097 --> 00:27:31.431
- May.
- February. Ha-ha-ha!


345
00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:34.309
I got seniority.
I'll make the statement.


346
00:27:34.602 --> 00:27:36.436
August 16.

347
00:27:37.272 --> 00:27:42.276
I read your records. Isn't that the date
you were hatched? August 16th ring a bell?


348
00:27:42.443 --> 00:27:44.236
I got seniority.

349
00:27:44.612 --> 00:27:45.779
Heh-heh-heh!

350
00:27:45.947 --> 00:27:47.614
All rise.

351
00:27:52.036 --> 00:27:53.871
The court is now in session.

352
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:56.874
The Honorable
Judge McCormack presiding.


353
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.125
Be seated.

354
00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:00.627
Your Honor.

355
00:28:01.337 --> 00:28:04.089
The defendants wish
to change their plea.


356
00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:05.674
Order!

357
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.053
Very well, counselor.
What is the plea?


358
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.848
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?

359
00:28:13.516 --> 00:28:15.267
Proceed, Mr. Tango.

360
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:18.854
It's okay.

361
00:28:23.693 --> 00:28:27.029
Your Honor, I've been
a policeman for 12 years.


362
00:28:27.488 --> 00:28:30.282
I think it's the best organization
in the country.


363
00:28:31.075 --> 00:28:35.412
I've been accused of being too aggressive
in taking criminals off the street.


364
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.997
Well, if that's a sin...

365
00:28:37.332 --> 00:28:39.124
...then I guess I'm guilty.

366
00:28:40.168 --> 00:28:42.085
All the cops I've worked with
are good cops.


367
00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:44.129
You are.

368
00:28:44.297 --> 00:28:45.881
Doing a tough job.

369
00:28:46.716 --> 00:28:51.053
I only hope that the outcome of this trial
is such that the whole department...


370
00:28:51.804 --> 00:28:56.058
...is not judged
by what has transpired here.


371
00:28:56.893 --> 00:28:58.018
Thank you.

372
00:28:59.479 --> 00:29:02.856
Ray. Ray, will you let me handle this?

373
00:29:04.901 --> 00:29:06.443
Not bad.

374
00:29:07.195 --> 00:29:09.363
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Cash?

375
00:29:11.032 --> 00:29:12.950
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- No! No, no.


376
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:15.077
- Yeah.
- No.


377
00:29:17.747 --> 00:29:21.500
Mr. Tango has spoken very eloquently.

378
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.878
And I wish I could be as forgiving.

379
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.631
But I can't, because...

380
00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:31.259
...this whole thing...

381
00:29:33.221 --> 00:29:34.221
...fucking sucks!

382
00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:36.598
This is the biggest pile of shit!

383
00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:39.893
- Your Honor!
- Order!


384
00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.564
That's right! Yeah!

385
00:29:44.732 --> 00:29:45.899
Order!

386
00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:49.569
Your Honor!
Be seated, Mr. Cash.


387
00:29:52.907 --> 00:29:56.159
Your Honor, the defendants
wish to plead no contest...


388
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:58.745
...to a charge of
voluntary manslaughter.


389
00:29:59.122 --> 00:30:00.998
I take it this
is part of an agreement?

390
00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:03.875
Yes. The state recommends a sentence...

391
00:30:04.168 --> 00:30:08.255
...of not more than 18 months
in a minimum-security facility.


392
00:30:09.966 --> 00:30:14.302
Mr. Cash, Mr. Tango, do you
enter this plea of your own free will?


393
00:30:15.263 --> 00:30:17.347
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.


394
00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:20.017
The agreement is
acceptable to the court.


395
00:30:20.393 --> 00:30:24.271
The defense and the state
will deliver the proper documentation.


396
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.898
Court is adjourned.

397
00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:34.114
Now that Tango and Cash
are behind bars...


398
00:30:34.449 --> 00:30:37.367
...you don't have to be afraid anymore.

399
00:30:38.786 --> 00:30:42.456
What's the matter, gentlemen?
You don't share my enthusiasm.


400
00:30:42.623 --> 00:30:44.291
Mr. Perret, I am sorry...

401
00:30:44.459 --> 00:30:48.628
...but I cannot appreciate
these games you keep playing.


402
00:30:48.796 --> 00:30:51.006
Forgive me for asking, Mr. Perret...

403
00:30:51.174 --> 00:30:54.551
...but what happens in 18 months
when they get out?


404
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.221
Use your imagination.

405
00:31:00.933 --> 00:31:04.811
What makes you think
they'll ever get out again?


406
00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:09.357
Now go take care of your business.

407
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.944
I got a feeling this is
gonna be a great year.


408
00:31:14.989 --> 00:31:18.575
These bozos ever hear
of shock absorbers? Welcome to Club Fed.


409
00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:20.911
You told me this was a vacation.

410
00:31:22.997 --> 00:31:25.332
End of the line. Get out.

411
00:31:26.709 --> 00:31:28.168
You, this way!

412
00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.471
What do you got to say now, genius?

413
00:31:41.349 --> 00:31:44.101
I don't think there's
a golf course here.


414
00:31:44.977 --> 00:31:48.021
Make yourselves
at home sweet home, boys.


415
00:31:49.023 --> 00:31:51.316
This has gotta be a mistake.
What do you think?


416
00:31:51.484 --> 00:31:55.237
I think my underwear
is riding into my throat. Ow!


417
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.865
They're not there?
They were on that bus!


418
00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:01.201
I'm already trying to trace them.

419
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:05.122
They were transferred
off the bus near Victorville.


420
00:32:05.373 --> 00:32:06.414
We gotta find them.

421
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.583
Your underwear problem is solved.

422
00:32:08.751 --> 00:32:11.378
I noticed. You can stop
holding in your stomach.


423
00:32:12.547 --> 00:32:17.092
Come on! Somebody bribed
the prison board! That's why we're here!


424
00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:20.720
They're as crooked as
everybody else in this deal.


425
00:32:21.681 --> 00:32:22.848
Oh, man.

426
00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:27.561
I'll tell you one thing.
Whoever set us up is fucking connected.


427
00:32:27.728 --> 00:32:29.938
Who do you think it is, Quan?

428
00:32:30.231 --> 00:32:31.565
Thanks.

429
00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:35.527
No, wait! I got it!

430
00:32:35.695 --> 00:32:37.320
It's Lopez!

431
00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:39.739
It's Lopez! Follow me through here.

432
00:32:39.907 --> 00:32:43.076
Lopez has a guy pretend
to try and kill me...


433
00:32:43.244 --> 00:32:45.245
...and claims that Quan
put him up to it.

434
00:32:45.413 --> 00:32:48.456
That Chinese guy feeds me
bogus information about the setup.


435
00:32:48.624 --> 00:32:52.586
That way Lopez figures, no matter
what happens, I'll think it was Quan.


436
00:32:52.753 --> 00:32:56.423
All the time it's Lopez,
and now I know it, right?


437
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:58.592
Well, what do you think?

438
00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:02.512
I think with your IQ,
you're unarmed and still very dangerous.


439
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.558
Okay, Sherlock Holmes, if you're so smart,
you tell me who set us up.


440
00:33:06.726 --> 00:33:10.478
- I don't know yet.
- Yeah! You don't know shit!


441
00:33:11.939 --> 00:33:13.773
What are you doing?

442
00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.358
Relax.

443
00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:17.110
Soap.

444
00:33:17.278 --> 00:33:18.445
And don't flatter yourself.

445
00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:20.238
Peewee.

446
00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.116
I don't know you that well.

447
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.995
Don't worry.
Someday the other one will drop.


448
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.165
Attaboy, tripod! 
You just keep talking.

449
00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:31.625
Sure thing, Minnie Mouse!

450
00:33:32.293 --> 00:33:33.835
By the way...

451
00:33:34.837 --> 00:33:37.631
...I think they're gonna stick us
in general population.


452
00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:39.174
Yeah?

453
00:33:39.842 --> 00:33:43.136
Well, you know they don't put cops
in general population.


454
00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:47.682
Never put cops in
general population, huh?


455
00:33:48.476 --> 00:33:51.019
Cash, I'll light your fucking bowels!

456
00:33:51.187 --> 00:33:52.979
Cash, I'm gonna put
brown sugar in your ass!


457
00:33:53.606 --> 00:33:55.482
Shit, I put half these guys away.

458
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.235
Tango, you're going to be my bitch!

459
00:33:58.402 --> 00:33:59.861
I'll kick your fucking ass!

460
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:01.613
- You know what I hate?
What?


461
00:34:01.781 --> 00:34:04.032
Litter.
Goddamn it!


462
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.868
What?
I forgot the marshmallows.


463
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.163
I don't think rehabilitation
is working here.


464
00:34:10.331 --> 00:34:12.540
They're just misunderstood, really.

465
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.376
Cops!

466
00:34:14.543 --> 00:34:18.255
Bring them to me!

467
00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:21.841
Cops! Cops!

468
00:34:22.885 --> 00:34:24.552
Bring them here!

469
00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.638
Come here!

470
00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:28.890
I want to talk to you.

471
00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.642
Hey, punk!

472
00:34:31.143 --> 00:34:34.521
When I get out of here,
I'll tear you a new ass.


473
00:34:34.855 --> 00:34:36.773
You know Captain Dynaball here?

474
00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:41.111
Yes! Yes! I loved you
in Conan the Barbarian.


475
00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:48.159
If you need me, me and my ass
will be in the neighborhood.


476
00:34:51.455 --> 00:34:54.040
You fucking pig! 
It's over for you!

477
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.918
You're gonna be very popular here.

478
00:34:57.211 --> 00:34:59.462
Funny, I don't see your fan club, either.

479
00:35:26.032 --> 00:35:29.576
Hey! That crapper is mine!

480
00:35:31.078 --> 00:35:33.788
And what am I supposed to use?

481
00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:38.084
I don't give a shit!
Just don't use that.


482
00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:43.840
Okay, bud. We're gonna
get one thing straight right now.


483
00:35:46.093 --> 00:35:47.927
That is yours!

484
00:35:56.604 --> 00:35:58.605
Would you mind stopping that?

485
00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:00.398
Thank you.

486
00:36:00.733 --> 00:36:01.775
I appreciate it.

487
00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:04.277
I'm not afraid of you.

488
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.075
You see that?

489
00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.409
I killed him.

490
00:36:12.286 --> 00:36:13.620
Congratulations.

491
00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:15.622
He was my best friend.

492
00:36:20.628 --> 00:36:23.004
Crazy people aren't afraid of anybody.

493
00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.802
Would you look at that?

494
00:36:30.262 --> 00:36:33.556
Sugar is up. I cannot believe this!

495
00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.872
Let's dance, Tango!

496
00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:41.040
Come on, Cash!

497
00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:43.334
Get the bag on him!

498
00:37:48.924 --> 00:37:50.842
Kill him!

499
00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:53.219
Kill him!

500
00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:54.762
Kill the fucker!

501
00:38:01.896 --> 00:38:03.730
You're dead meat, Tango!

502
00:38:35.262 --> 00:38:37.680
- They got you?
- What's it look like?


503
00:38:40.893 --> 00:38:42.685
Oh, yeah, let me guess.

504
00:38:42.937 --> 00:38:44.604
The welcoming committee.

505
00:38:44.897 --> 00:38:46.898
It's either that or a surprise party.

506
00:38:47.691 --> 00:38:49.025
Don't make a move.

507
00:38:49.443 --> 00:38:51.194
We'll talk our way out of this.

508
00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:54.113
I don't think they're into small talk.

509
00:38:54.448 --> 00:38:56.282
If we panic, we're history.

510
00:38:56.617 --> 00:38:57.951
Ah, the infamous...

511
00:38:58.118 --> 00:39:00.954
...Cash and Tango.

512
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:03.957
Dishonored, imprisoned.

513
00:39:04.124 --> 00:39:06.626
What a shameful fall from glory.

514
00:39:06.794 --> 00:39:08.169
And who are you?

515
00:39:09.505 --> 00:39:12.465
Just think of me as somebody who...

516
00:39:13.801 --> 00:39:15.635
...doesn't like you very much.

517
00:39:16.136 --> 00:39:17.804
The surprise party is out.

518
00:39:21.141 --> 00:39:24.352
Oh, shit. That's the guy
I followed to the setup.


519
00:39:26.855 --> 00:39:27.897
Don't panic.

520
00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:33.820
Tarty Tango.
You're a pretty boy, aren't you?


521
00:39:34.029 --> 00:39:35.071
I'm panicking.

522
00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:37.991
How would you like me
to change it for you?


523
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.701
- I wouldn't.
- How about you?


524
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:43.580
- Maybe you first.
- Don't panic.


525
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:48.543
I'll cut your throat,
yank your tongue out the hole...


526
00:39:48.752 --> 00:39:51.004
...and tie it in
a Windsor knot for you.

527
00:39:51.171 --> 00:39:53.965
- I don't wear ties. That's him.
- Brave boy.


528
00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:56.384
You wanna cut my throat?! Go ahead!

529
00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.386
You wanna cut my fucking head off?!

530
00:39:58.846 --> 00:40:02.348
You can bowl the motherfucker
for all I care! Just don't let him do it!


531
00:40:02.725 --> 00:40:06.352
I don't wanna get killed by this
limey immigrant jerk-off!


532
00:40:06.562 --> 00:40:09.856
I wanna get killed
by an American jerk-off!


533
00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.274
You fucking wanker!

534
00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.860
Put it away for now.

535
00:40:15.195 --> 00:40:16.696
Just for now.

536
00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:20.700
Some of your other friends
want to say hello first.


537
00:40:21.201 --> 00:40:22.410
What are you doing?

538
00:40:22.703 --> 00:40:24.579
- Buying time.
- Time for what?


539
00:40:24.747 --> 00:40:25.788
I don't know yet.

540
00:40:28.876 --> 00:40:31.127
- Oh, shit, it's Conan. It's Conan.
- What?


541
00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:33.171
- We're gonna get FUBAR now.
- What's FUBAR?


542
00:40:33.339 --> 00:40:34.631
You'll see.

543
00:40:35.049 --> 00:40:37.258
Real bad-ass cops!

544
00:40:39.094 --> 00:40:41.220
You don't look so tough now, do you?

545
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:42.805
Do you, you fuck?!

546
00:40:43.057 --> 00:40:44.223
He must mean you.

547
00:40:44.391 --> 00:40:46.225
This pig and his cop friends...

548
00:40:46.393 --> 00:40:48.936
...broke my ribs, my leg and my jaw.

549
00:40:51.523 --> 00:40:52.815
You broke that jaw?

550
00:40:53.609 --> 00:40:55.943
- He deserved it.
Why did you do that?


551
00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:57.278
- Why?
- Yeah, why?


552
00:40:57.446 --> 00:40:59.030
- I was having a bad day!
Like now?


553
00:40:59.198 --> 00:41:00.865
Like now!

554
00:41:41.865 --> 00:41:43.741
Don't panic!

555
00:41:44.785 --> 00:41:46.285
Don't panic!

556
00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:09.475
Rats in a maze...

557
00:42:09.685 --> 00:42:11.728
...men in a cage.

558
00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:16.941
Come on, lads. Place your bets!
Which bloke survives?


559
00:42:17.317 --> 00:42:18.860
Who's a brave boy?

560
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.361
Who fries first?

561
00:42:24.867 --> 00:42:26.826
Cook, you bastard!

562
00:42:27.202 --> 00:42:29.662
Tango, you got any family?

563
00:42:30.706 --> 00:42:32.498
Yeah. You?

564
00:42:33.625 --> 00:42:36.210
I'm going steady with an alimony check.
That's about it.


565
00:42:37.629 --> 00:42:40.131
First, Mr. Cash.

566
00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:43.176
No, don't do it! No!

567
00:42:43.343 --> 00:42:46.345
- Cash!
- It's all right, man.


568
00:42:51.852 --> 00:42:56.147
Motherfuck you!

569
00:42:58.317 --> 00:42:59.400
Son of a bitch!

570
00:43:03.071 --> 00:43:10.703
Cash!

571
00:43:14.041 --> 00:43:15.082
Fuck you.

572
00:43:24.009 --> 00:43:25.051
Tango?

573
00:43:27.387 --> 00:43:28.387
Fry, Tango.

574
00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:46.781
Get them the hell down!

575
00:43:49.993 --> 00:43:51.619
Off the scaffolding!

576
00:43:52.246 --> 00:43:54.121
Lock this place down!

577
00:43:57.376 --> 00:43:58.709
Ah, shit.

578
00:43:58.877 --> 00:44:01.128
Cash, you fight this one. 
I'm burned out.

579
00:44:03.465 --> 00:44:05.591
SOKOWSKl: You look like hell, Cash.
- Matt?


580
00:44:07.302 --> 00:44:10.346
- Matt, it is you, isn't it? Say it is.
- It is.


581
00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:14.016
- Oh, God, am I glad to see you!
- Cash!


582
00:44:14.226 --> 00:44:16.060
- Yeah?
- My arm.


583
00:44:18.814 --> 00:44:21.440
- Who's this guy?
- Matt Sokowski. I'm assistant warden.


584
00:44:21.608 --> 00:44:23.568
He was my C.O.
When I started on the force.


585
00:44:23.735 --> 00:44:25.862
- You guys are in deep shit.
- Shit.


586
00:44:26.029 --> 00:44:29.115
- Really?
- Yeah. Who the hell set you up?


587
00:44:29.324 --> 00:44:31.200
I think we just met him.

588
00:44:31.451 --> 00:44:35.913
If this creep wants us dead so bad,
why doesn't he put a bullet in our head?


589
00:44:36.081 --> 00:44:37.915
Why play this game?

590
00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:39.375
Maybe he has a boring nightlife.

591
00:44:39.543 --> 00:44:42.753
How'd he get in?
- Anything can happen behind these walls.


592
00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:46.465
All you need is the cash.
We have the best guards money can buy.


593
00:44:46.675 --> 00:44:49.677
You got the bucks, you get what you need.
The place is corrupt.


594
00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:52.972
Once you're back in general population,
somebody's gonna nail you.


595
00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:56.183
The way I see it,
you got only one choice: Escape.


596
00:44:56.435 --> 00:44:57.727
Escape?

597
00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.020
Yeah.

598
00:44:59.187 --> 00:45:02.148
I'll get a spoon
and we'll start tunneling out of here...


599
00:45:02.316 --> 00:45:06.027
...and you can help me chew through
the bars. Come on, this is bullshit.


600
00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:07.278
What's with your friend?

601
00:45:07.696 --> 00:45:10.114
He's upset. He misses his wardrobe.

602
00:45:11.325 --> 00:45:12.700
What are you saying, Matt?

603
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.161
Listen, I got a plan worked out.

604
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:16.454
How do we trust him?

605
00:45:16.622 --> 00:45:18.664
We've known each other for 15 years.

606
00:45:18.957 --> 00:45:20.583
- We trusted our lawyers.
And the judge.


607
00:45:20.792 --> 00:45:24.128
And that got us nowhere.
This time, you're gonna have to trust me.


608
00:45:24.463 --> 00:45:27.089
Now that is a risky proposition.

609
00:45:29.635 --> 00:45:31.886
SOKOWSKl:
Come on, Gabe, I got a present for you.


610
00:45:32.179 --> 00:45:34.430
You're unbelievable.

611
00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.852
I do miss my wardrobe.

612
00:45:40.687 --> 00:45:42.730
SOKOWSKl:
This is the prison ventilation system.


613
00:45:42.898 --> 00:45:45.650
You get to it from
the utility shaft in the yard.


614
00:45:45.817 --> 00:45:48.986
This main ventilation shaft
leads outside beyond the wall.


615
00:45:49.154 --> 00:45:52.907
I can shut one of these fans down
and leave this vent door unlocked.


616
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.203
I'll get you the right work detail and leave
everything you need outside the shaft.


617
00:45:57.871 --> 00:45:59.497
This way looks faster.

618
00:45:59.665 --> 00:46:02.500
SOKOWSKl: No, long way around.
Let's stick to plan A.


619
00:46:02.668 --> 00:46:04.710
SOKOWSKl:
Let's get you guys to the infirmary.


620
00:46:04.878 --> 00:46:06.253
Why use your plan A?

621
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:10.967
It's a hell of a lot better than your plan B,
which you don't even have.


622
00:46:12.636 --> 00:46:14.053
Not yet, Cash, but I will.

623
00:46:19.893 --> 00:46:22.019
My partner in pain.

624
00:46:22.729 --> 00:46:25.606
I only got a minute.
Sokowski got us trash detail. Let's go.


625
00:46:25.774 --> 00:46:29.402
- Whoopee! Race you to the Dumpster.
- It's set up for right now. Come on.


626
00:46:29.945 --> 00:46:31.362
Negative.

627
00:46:31.947 --> 00:46:34.573
- What?
- I'm not going. I changed my mind.


628
00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:37.410
Did you have a brain meltdown?

629
00:46:37.577 --> 00:46:40.329
I have a slight aversion
to getting FUBAR.


630
00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.915
- What's FUBAR?
- "Fucked up beyond all recognition. "


631
00:46:43.083 --> 00:46:44.208
What is your problem?

632
00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:47.545
I'm not waltzing into anybody's trap.
I don't trust Sokowski!


633
00:46:47.713 --> 00:46:50.423
Sokowski's a cop, for chrissake!

634
00:46:52.551 --> 00:46:53.592
What's this?

635
00:46:54.761 --> 00:46:56.220
This is my fiancĂ©e, Slinky.

636
00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:58.347
Up, Slinky.

637
00:47:01.393 --> 00:47:04.937
- Let's see how business is.
- Seriously...


638
00:47:05.105 --> 00:47:09.233
...you are one major mistrustful,
maladjusted human fucking being!


639
00:47:09.401 --> 00:47:10.901
Well, I love you too.

640
00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:12.445
Ray, I'm not coming back for you.

641
00:47:12.654 --> 00:47:14.613
You're making a big mistake.

642
00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:18.117
You don't have to.
I hope you make it on the outside, Cash.


643
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:23.164
Let's go, you're late!

644
00:47:25.167 --> 00:47:28.294
I hope you and Cousin It here...

645
00:47:28.462 --> 00:47:30.337
...are very happy together...

646
00:47:30.505 --> 00:47:33.174
...and raise a beautiful litter.

647
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:36.302
Ciao.

648
00:48:05.332 --> 00:48:08.876
Where've you been, asshole?
You're a half hour late.


649
00:48:09.169 --> 00:48:10.878
I'm doing my best, boss.

650
00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:42.887
Matt!

651
00:49:55.817 --> 00:49:56.859
There he is!

652
00:49:58.236 --> 00:49:59.361
Come on, let's go!

653
00:50:14.753 --> 00:50:16.253
Out of my way!

654
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.837
What are you doing here?
- I got lonely.


655
00:51:01.216 --> 00:51:02.633
I can't hold it all day!

656
00:51:12.435 --> 00:51:13.560
Shit!

657
00:51:16.564 --> 00:51:17.815
Come on, Cash!

658
00:51:21.569 --> 00:51:22.945
This way!
Come on!


659
00:51:25.907 --> 00:51:27.032
Move it!

660
00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:39.378
Your friend Matt
waltzed you right into a trap!


661
00:51:39.546 --> 00:51:40.921
How could you be so stupid?

662
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:42.798
Matt's dead.

663
00:51:43.258 --> 00:51:45.968
They cut his throat ear to ear.
Know what I mean?


664
00:51:46.511 --> 00:51:47.553
Ponytail!

665
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:49.471
Yeah. This is the way.

666
00:52:02.277 --> 00:52:05.237
You'll like this.
It's the best ride in the park.


667
00:52:05.613 --> 00:52:07.156
Come on, this way!

668
00:52:07.532 --> 00:52:10.617
Know where you're going?
Absolutely.


669
00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:13.537
Sure you know where you're going?

670
00:52:13.705 --> 00:52:15.372
I know exactly where I'm going!

671
00:52:15.623 --> 00:52:17.875
Then get your ass out of my face
and get there!


672
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:29.928
Come on!

673
00:52:49.074 --> 00:52:51.283
Is this the only way?
No.


674
00:52:51.493 --> 00:52:53.827
We can go back. Let's go!

675
00:52:58.792 --> 00:52:59.958
This way!

676
00:53:01.795 --> 00:53:04.213
- You sure this is the way?
- It's exactly the way!


677
00:53:04.506 --> 00:53:06.382
Let's go! Sector 4!

678
00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:13.222
- Tango!
- What?


679
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.307
Don't touch those wires.

680
00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:16.934
Thanks.

681
00:53:25.318 --> 00:53:27.236
- Know what?
- What?


682
00:53:27.987 --> 00:53:29.822
I'm getting real tired of electricity.

683
00:53:29.989 --> 00:53:31.657
Nag, nag, nag!

684
00:53:45.171 --> 00:53:47.423
- Now what?
- Okay, no problem.


685
00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.300
Jump to those wires, slide down,
and we're home free.


686
00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:54.304
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.


687
00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.890
We're gonna fry.

688
00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.143
- You know anything about electricity?
- No.


689
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:02.688
If you only touch one wire and don't touch
the ground, you don't get electrocuted.


690
00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.651
- Right?
- I don't know.


691
00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:08.861
I don't either.

692
00:54:10.488 --> 00:54:12.614
I owe you from back there.

693
00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:14.741
So you can go first.

694
00:54:14.993 --> 00:54:18.287
- Uh-uh. And you still owe me.
- I knew you'd say that.


695
00:54:20.707 --> 00:54:23.125
If I don't make
it, will you even try?

696
00:54:23.376 --> 00:54:24.960
Depends how close you get.

697
00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:17.429
What's the matter, Tango?
Come on, dog!


698
00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:28.273
Come on, dog! Heel!

699
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.320
Come on, puppy!

700
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.572
You want more?

701
00:55:36.115 --> 00:55:38.116
Move it, move it!

702
00:55:40.411 --> 00:55:41.954
Come on, Tango.

703
00:55:42.121 --> 00:55:43.747
Come on, doggy!

704
00:55:45.917 --> 00:55:47.417
Speak, doggy! Speak!

705
00:56:08.606 --> 00:56:10.566
Tango!

706
00:56:56.779 --> 00:56:58.447
That was fun.

707
00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:02.159
Jesus Christ! What did you do,
stop for coffee and a Danish?


708
00:57:02.327 --> 00:57:03.827
I hate Danish.

709
00:57:03.995 --> 00:57:07.039
- Come on, we gotta get out of here.
- All right.


710
00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:10.626
- Nice doing time with you.
- I'll never forget that time in the shower.


711
00:57:10.793 --> 00:57:13.712
If it gets too hot for you
in the streets...


712
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.591
...go to a club named Cleopatra's.
Ask for Catherine.


713
00:57:17.842 --> 00:57:20.218
- She'll know where to find me.
- Got it.


714
00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.471
Hey, Ray!

715
00:57:23.723 --> 00:57:25.223
I really do owe you one.

716
00:57:30.104 --> 00:57:32.606
Quan and Lopez on line one.

717
00:57:34.192 --> 00:57:35.776
Put them on.

718
00:57:36.736 --> 00:57:40.197
Gentlemen, I've already heard
about the escape.


719
00:57:40.406 --> 00:57:41.990
Mr. Perret...

720
00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.117
...this is most disturbing.

721
00:57:44.369 --> 00:57:47.287
We are being threatened by two maniacs.

722
00:57:47.455 --> 00:57:49.581
I think we must take some action.

723
00:57:49.749 --> 00:57:54.586
There you go thinking again.
That'll be the cause of your downfall.


724
00:57:55.046 --> 00:57:56.421
Try to control your fear.

725
00:57:56.756 --> 00:57:59.841
These men are convicted killers
and fugitives.


726
00:58:00.051 --> 00:58:02.052
They won't last long on the outside.

727
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:07.182
Mr. Perret, we cannot rely
on the police. I insist...


728
00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.767
Don't insist!

729
00:58:13.272 --> 00:58:16.358
Insistent people make me angry.

730
00:58:17.568 --> 00:58:19.903
Everything is under control.

731
00:58:30.957 --> 00:58:32.457
Cover your tracks.

732
00:58:39.799 --> 00:58:41.800
Oh, you're beautiful.

733
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:46.805
Oh, gee. Hope they're all right.

734
00:58:46.973 --> 00:58:49.099
Attention, commencing live fire test.

735
00:59:02.155 --> 00:59:03.572
Owen.

736
00:59:03.823 --> 00:59:07.659
Hey, Gabe, I knew you'd come here.
How'd you get out?


737
00:59:07.827 --> 00:59:09.453
You got something I can change into?

738
00:59:09.704 --> 00:59:10.787
Sure, sure.

739
00:59:13.332 --> 00:59:15.751
Nice to see we have
the same taste in clothes.


740
00:59:16.335 --> 00:59:18.628
Hey, Gabe,
do you need a special weapon?


741
00:59:18.838 --> 00:59:20.547
I need a gun, a big gun.

742
00:59:20.715 --> 00:59:23.091
Oh. Are those big enough for you?

743
00:59:24.844 --> 00:59:26.178
Yeah, pefrect.

744
00:59:28.014 --> 00:59:31.433
I always knew we shared
the same taste in weaponry.


745
00:59:32.059 --> 00:59:34.352
Gabe, check out the pooch.

746
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.606
A new invention
in senior-citizen home protection.


747
00:59:42.487 --> 00:59:44.404
Well...

748
00:59:44.572 --> 00:59:47.115
- Well, you know, the gun boots are great.
- Pefrect.


749
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:49.701
See you, buddy.

750
01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:10.972
Knock, knock.

751
01:00:13.768 --> 01:00:15.310
Yuck!

752
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:19.439
From the look of your diet, you're not
too interested in counting calories.


753
01:00:19.607 --> 01:00:22.859
Could it be you're too busy counting
the money they paid you to set us up?


754
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:24.820
I didn't set you up.

755
01:00:25.279 --> 01:00:26.863
You think I'm judging you unfairly?

756
01:00:27.073 --> 01:00:29.032
Hell, yes! I had
nothing to do with it!

757
01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.243
Nothing to do with it?

758
01:00:34.205 --> 01:00:35.497
Wyler, can we be frank?

759
01:00:35.748 --> 01:00:37.374
You're looking terribly anemic.

760
01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:41.211
I think what you need
is a little... iron in your diet.


761
01:00:41.379 --> 01:00:43.255
I know you switched those weapons...

762
01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:46.007
...and planted the murder weapon
at the scene, didn't you?


763
01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:48.051
- They paid me.
- Who paid you?


764
01:00:48.219 --> 01:00:51.096
- I don't know.
- You FBI guys are real brainy.


765
01:00:51.264 --> 01:00:54.182
- Think, think, think!
- An Englishman with red hair.


766
01:00:54.392 --> 01:00:55.934
Yeah, and a ponytail.

767
01:00:56.602 --> 01:00:58.854
"You're going down for this. "
Remember those lyrics?


768
01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:02.107
You sang it to me loud and clear.
But you're going down.


769
01:01:02.608 --> 01:01:06.611
It doesn't matter. They want me dead.
My life isn't worth shit.


770
01:01:07.947 --> 01:01:10.365
That's true. But I need you anyway.

771
01:01:10.908 --> 01:01:14.536
Take me in! I'll tell them what I know!
We'll help each other.


772
01:01:14.787 --> 01:01:16.788
I hope you got paid real well, Wyler.

773
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.915
You wanna split it?

774
01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.964
Wyler! Wyler!

775
01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:59.080
Who are you?

776
01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.374
What are you doing here?

777
01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:04.169
Who the hell do you think you are?

778
01:02:04.503 --> 01:02:06.171
Excuse me!

779
01:02:08.674 --> 01:02:10.050
Hey!

780
01:02:15.181 --> 01:02:17.098
Who hired you to do the tape, Skinner?

781
01:02:23.689 --> 01:02:26.149
Lucky for me this place is soundproof.

782
01:02:26.317 --> 01:02:28.360
Nobody will hear me
beating the truth out of you.


783
01:02:29.153 --> 01:02:32.197
Hey, I see you
got all my greatest hits.

784
01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:33.490
And Tango's.

785
01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:36.284
You put together a nice compilation.

786
01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.828
He told me he'd kill me.

787
01:02:39.038 --> 01:02:40.914
- Who?
- He didn't tell me his name.


788
01:02:41.207 --> 01:02:42.540
I swear to God!

789
01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.378
How fortunate they asked you
to authenticate your own work.


790
01:02:47.713 --> 01:02:49.339
I am the foremost expert.

791
01:02:49.507 --> 01:02:53.009
You won't be for long if you keep
using junky equipment like this.


792
01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:55.971
What do you mean?
It's state-of-the-art equipment.


793
01:03:01.727 --> 01:03:03.061
What do you want to know?!

794
01:03:03.229 --> 01:03:05.271
- How were you contacted?
- By phone.


795
01:03:05.439 --> 01:03:07.023
- How'd you get him the tape?
- By mail.


796
01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:09.192
- Where to?
- I don't remember the address.


797
01:03:12.154 --> 01:03:14.072
But I recorded the conversation.

798
01:03:15.366 --> 01:03:17.075
- Happy to play it for you.
- There you go!


799
01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:26.084
Captain Schroeder, please.

800
01:03:27.253 --> 01:03:30.338
He's got to be there.
Would you check, please?


801
01:03:31.048 --> 01:03:36.469
All right. Just tell him his favorite
stockbroker is back in town. He'll know.


802
01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:54.404
- Five-buck cover charge, pal.
- Sure.


803
01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.433
- Catherine working tonight?
- Who?


804
01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:26.019
- Catherine.
- Don't know any Catherine.


805
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.274
Catherine here tonight?

806
01:05:13.526 --> 01:05:15.193
We have a hundred Catherines here.

807
01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.702
Hey! Joe! Sticks!

808
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:28.206
Where's my beer?
I'm sorry. He distracted me.


809
01:05:28.499 --> 01:05:30.875
I've been waiting 15 minutes.
I'm sorry.


810
01:05:31.043 --> 01:05:34.796
Tell you what, this one's on me.
I'm really sorry.


811
01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:51.146
Cover that exit. Come with me.

812
01:06:23.345 --> 01:06:25.013
What do you think you're doing?

813
01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:56.461
Hold it.

814
01:06:56.962 --> 01:06:59.297
Kiki, nice work.
Wait a minute.


815
01:06:59.465 --> 01:07:00.965
I'm Catherine.

816
01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:04.802
Only one person calls me that.

817
01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:09.015
Ray Tango said you could
help me find him.


818
01:07:09.183 --> 01:07:10.808
I haven't seen Ray in a while.

819
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:14.270
There's a full-blown
police convention out there.


820
01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:17.607
Is there someplace else we can talk?

821
01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.192
Is he all right?

822
01:07:19.443 --> 01:07:21.069
Not if I don't get out of here.

823
01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:24.447
- Out the back, through the alley.
- They'll have it covered.


824
01:07:25.491 --> 01:07:26.991
Any other ideas?

825
01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:28.493
Hey, Elvis!

826
01:07:28.994 --> 01:07:30.161
What size do you wear?

827
01:07:38.504 --> 01:07:39.837
Hold it.

828
01:07:41.006 --> 01:07:42.507
Let's have a look.

829
01:07:45.844 --> 01:07:47.512
Something wrong?

830
01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:01.609
Hey, Lynn, let's go!

831
01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:24.549
Hey, Red.

832
01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:27.969
Aerobics instructor, huh?

833
01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:31.389
- Kiki?
- Hey, bud, get your hands off my property.


834
01:08:35.352 --> 01:08:38.438
Any chance of a three-way?

835
01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.983
Dykes on bikes, eh, captain?

836
01:08:54.705 --> 01:08:58.666
So then you knew
who I was all along.

837
01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:02.211
I figured it out. You and Ray
have been getting a lot of press lately.


838
01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:03.671
I bet.

839
01:09:04.548 --> 01:09:06.382
We were set up good.

840
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:10.928
I know. Ray couldn't have
done all the things he's accused of.


841
01:09:11.513 --> 01:09:13.556
You I'm not so sure about.

842
01:09:13.724 --> 01:09:15.099
Ow.

843
01:09:15.893 --> 01:09:18.102
God, how did this happen?

844
01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:22.106
Sliding off a high-tension wire
into a pine tree at 40 mph...


845
01:09:22.274 --> 01:09:24.400
...tends to slip a disk or two.

846
01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:27.820
Let's see if we
can slip it back in.

847
01:09:29.615 --> 01:09:31.407
- How's that feel?
- Are you kidding?


848
01:09:31.575 --> 01:09:35.453
Six or seven more hours of this
and I'll be on the road to recovery.


849
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:40.875
So...

850
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.586
...what's the story with you and Ray?

851
01:09:43.754 --> 01:09:44.962
What do you mean?

852
01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:49.300
You know.
Do you love him? Hate him?


853
01:09:49.468 --> 01:09:51.344
None of the above?

854
01:09:51.845 --> 01:09:53.513
I love him.

855
01:09:54.098 --> 01:09:55.139
You do?

856
01:09:55.557 --> 01:09:59.769
Of course. He loves me too.
He just has a funny way of showing it.


857
01:10:00.562 --> 01:10:03.356
You guys see a lot of each other?

858
01:10:03.649 --> 01:10:05.525
He comes and goes as he pleases.

859
01:10:05.692 --> 01:10:07.235
That's a little insensitive.

860
01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:10.154
But I live my own life.

861
01:10:10.489 --> 01:10:12.073
Good for you.

862
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:15.034
Lower.

863
01:10:24.002 --> 01:10:26.421
Kiki?
Yeah?


864
01:10:28.674 --> 01:10:31.801
- Lower?
Yeah.


865
01:10:32.177 --> 01:10:33.219
Harder.

866
01:10:33.387 --> 01:10:35.680
I'll just move it around real slow.

867
01:10:39.685 --> 01:10:42.603
Don't stop.
I can do this all night.


868
01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.689
God, prove it.

869
01:10:45.524 --> 01:10:46.858
Faster.

870
01:10:47.025 --> 01:10:48.776
More?

871
01:10:49.027 --> 01:10:50.736
Deeper.
- Oh, my God, Gabe!


872
01:10:50.904 --> 01:10:53.281
- I can feel it going in!
Oh! Harder!


873
01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.867
- It's almost in!
God! It's all the way in!


874
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:59.954
Heads up, sleazebag!

875
01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.709
Ray?

876
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.004
- Captain?
- This the way you screen all your guests?


877
01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.547
I'm sorry, captain.

878
01:11:09.715 --> 01:11:12.133
Freeze! Drop the duck!

879
01:11:13.218 --> 01:11:14.218
Tango?

880
01:11:14.428 --> 01:11:18.514
Real great police work!
Way to go, Cash! Way to stay on top of it!


881
01:11:18.682 --> 01:11:20.641
- What were you doing?
Nice to see you too.


882
01:11:20.893 --> 01:11:22.643
You almost nailed your captain.

883
01:11:22.895 --> 01:11:25.062
At least I saw him!
What were you doing in there?


884
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:27.356
I was getting ready to make my move.

885
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:30.234
- By the way, your girlfriend...
- My sister!


886
01:11:30.402 --> 01:11:31.694
- My what?
- Your what?


887
01:11:31.862 --> 01:11:34.697
- My sister.
- She's your...?


888
01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.742
That's great! I don't mean that.

889
01:11:38.035 --> 01:11:39.952
Look, I know it had to look bad.

890
01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:43.664
I never deliberately
punched out anyone in my life.


891
01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:46.083
But you I'm gonna hammer
right through the lawn.


892
01:11:46.251 --> 01:11:48.252
- Oh, really?
Who do you think you are?


893
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.797
Don't you know how to use a doorbell?
Just stick out your finger and push.


894
01:11:51.965 --> 01:11:55.092
- Isn't this 125 Orange Grove Street?
Yeah, it is.


895
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.429
This is my place. I have some rights
under my own place, don't I?


896
01:11:58.597 --> 01:12:03.309
No, Catherine. It's my roof, my house,
and I let you dwell here.


897
01:12:03.477 --> 01:12:04.602
I pay you rent!

898
01:12:04.937 --> 01:12:07.396
- You're two weeks late.
- If you would check your mail...


899
01:12:07.564 --> 01:12:10.358
Well, in Tango's defense,
he has been in prison.


900
01:12:13.487 --> 01:12:16.864
Excuse me, my pantyhose
are riding into the unknown.


901
01:12:17.115 --> 01:12:18.699
Way up in the unknown.

902
01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:21.202
Just answer me one thing, seriously.

903
01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:24.789
What were you doing on the couch
with Queen-for-a-Day?


904
01:12:27.292 --> 01:12:29.126
It's none of your business.

905
01:12:29.503 --> 01:12:30.545
Catherine...

906
01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:34.715
She got the brains and the looks.
How do you figure it?


907
01:12:34.967 --> 01:12:36.300
I don't.

908
01:12:36.468 --> 01:12:38.344
- Smoke?
- No.


909
01:12:38.512 --> 01:12:40.429
To protect against guys like him!

910
01:12:40.597 --> 01:12:43.432
All right. All right, that's it!

911
01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:45.518
You're not gonna run us in, are you?

912
01:12:45.811 --> 01:12:49.480
No, but I can only keep the department
off your backs for 24 hours.


913
01:12:49.731 --> 01:12:51.399
The feds are on the case!

914
01:12:51.817 --> 01:12:55.069
I suggest you slip into something
a little more butch.


915
01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:58.239
You get rid of Daffy Duck there
and try to clear your names.


916
01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.824
Already started.

917
01:13:00.742 --> 01:13:01.784
What do you got?

918
01:13:02.327 --> 01:13:04.662
This tape will clear our names.

919
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:06.664
Compliments of Jumbo the forger.

920
01:13:06.832 --> 01:13:07.957
Skinner?

921
01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:10.543
Yeah. So, what have you got?

922
01:13:11.003 --> 01:13:12.086
About quarter to four.

923
01:13:13.839 --> 01:13:16.090
Look, start with this.

924
01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:19.093
We ID'd that creep from the warehouse.

925
01:13:19.303 --> 01:13:22.471
- Ponytail?
- Yeah. His name's Requin.


926
01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:25.182
Look him up.
The address is right there.


927
01:13:25.684 --> 01:13:28.644
You got 24 hours to find the guy
who set you up.


928
01:13:28.854 --> 01:13:31.355
When's the clock start?
- Five minutes ago.


929
01:13:32.316 --> 01:13:33.357
Catherine.

930
01:13:33.817 --> 01:13:34.859
Honestly...

931
01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.362
...what were you doing
with the Elephant Man?


932
01:13:41.867 --> 01:13:43.367
Please.

933
01:13:43.535 --> 01:13:46.495
Come in the house. 
Change your clothes.

934
01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:50.207
You'll make a very ugly bride someday.

935
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.043
Is that a proposal?

936
01:13:58.884 --> 01:14:01.218
- Blue one's nice.
Blue it is.


937
01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.971
Sorry about my behavior tonight.

938
01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:06.349
I just want you to be okay.

939
01:14:06.558 --> 01:14:07.975
I'm okay.

940
01:14:08.602 --> 01:14:11.896
I can't believe all that's happened.
How did you get out of prison?


941
01:14:12.064 --> 01:14:15.191
Cash. He had a friend on the inside.

942
01:14:15.359 --> 01:14:18.194
I didn't wanna come here,
but I had no other place to go.


943
01:14:18.362 --> 01:14:21.072
You're my brother.
Where else are you supposed to go?


944
01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:24.158
- The North Pole would be nice.
- Seriously, what are you gonna do?


945
01:14:24.409 --> 01:14:27.036
Maybe you'd be better off
turning yourself in.


946
01:14:27.204 --> 01:14:28.996
- And talking to the press.
- No.


947
01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:35.086
- How's the career going at the club?
- That's great!


948
01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:38.756
You're being hunted
and you're worried about my dancing?


949
01:14:38.924 --> 01:14:40.758
I'm not worried about anything.

950
01:14:40.926 --> 01:14:45.221
If you needed a little extra cash,
I could buy you a bond or something.


951
01:14:45.389 --> 01:14:47.890
It's a seven-and-a-quarter yield.

952
01:14:48.058 --> 01:14:49.225
Big money.

953
01:14:50.394 --> 01:14:54.063
- You help me out more than you need to.
- No, I don't.


954
01:14:54.272 --> 01:14:57.358
I spend so much time with my career,
I hardly get a chance to see you.


955
01:14:57.609 --> 01:15:00.861
You have nothing to feel guilty about.
I love you.


956
01:15:03.949 --> 01:15:05.282
Put her there.

957
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:08.244
Push them back, way back!

958
01:15:10.288 --> 01:15:12.456
I gotta go.
I don't wanna put you in jeopardy.


959
01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:16.460
- What are you talking about?
- All that filth and scum I have to deal with.


960
01:15:16.753 --> 01:15:18.629
- Here I am!
- See?


961
01:15:18.797 --> 01:15:20.923
Clock's running, Ray. Let's go.

962
01:15:21.466 --> 01:15:22.925
See you later.

963
01:15:23.093 --> 01:15:25.136
- Mind if I have a word with Kiki?
- No.


964
01:15:25.303 --> 01:15:27.596
I just wanted to say
I was having a wonderful time...


965
01:15:27.806 --> 01:15:31.267
...until Captain Fantastic leaped the couch
and smashed through your door.


966
01:15:31.435 --> 01:15:36.480
Anyway, when this is straightened out,
could we get together again?


967
01:15:36.648 --> 01:15:38.607
Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice.

968
01:15:38.817 --> 01:15:40.818
Maybe we can go down to the ballpark...

969
01:15:40.986 --> 01:15:42.570
Can I talk to you?

970
01:15:44.322 --> 01:15:46.407
Cash, I don't think
my sister is your type.

971
01:16:40.712 --> 01:16:42.296
Easy, mate.

972
01:16:43.882 --> 01:16:45.007
Come on.

973
01:16:50.222 --> 01:16:51.222
Been expecting you.

974
01:16:52.724 --> 01:16:56.769
Shame, shame. Ponytails are out
this season. How you doing, Cash?


975
01:16:57.437 --> 01:16:59.980
Things are getting better by the second.

976
01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:02.900
- There's a party on the roof.
- Can I invite Mr. Potato Head?


977
01:17:03.068 --> 01:17:05.694
Sure. Wouldn't be a party
without Potato Head.


978
01:17:06.905 --> 01:17:08.656
No!
Plan A.


979
01:17:08.865 --> 01:17:10.199
This party's really fun!

980
01:17:10.367 --> 01:17:13.661
Thanks. How about it, Requin?
Hell of a view, huh?


981
01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.913
Come on, meat puppet!
Who pulls your strings?


982
01:17:16.081 --> 01:17:19.083
Piss off! Bollocks to plan A!

983
01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:22.169
I like this. The view's great up here!

984
01:17:23.296 --> 01:17:25.589
- What'd he say?
- Plan A's a loser.


985
01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:30.594
Hold on. Give me a name, Death Breath,
or you're going back to England in a baggie!


986
01:17:30.887 --> 01:17:34.098
Up yours, asshole!
You ain't worth a toss.


987
01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:35.558
Go on, drop me.

988
01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:37.017
Do it!

989
01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.435
Plan A is definitely a loser.

990
01:17:38.728 --> 01:17:41.438
- Bigtime. Let's go to plan B.
- You got a plan B?


991
01:17:41.606 --> 01:17:43.023
Hiroshima. Ring a bell?

992
01:17:43.316 --> 01:17:44.692
This is plan B?

993
01:17:44.943 --> 01:17:46.402
Can I talk to you for a minute?

994
01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.612
Not now, I'm busy.

995
01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.616
Just a second. Please.

996
01:17:52.784 --> 01:17:56.203
- Seriously, you're getting a little radical.
- What's radical?


997
01:17:56.454 --> 01:17:59.957
Blowing a man's head off with
a fucking hand grenade is a touch much.


998
01:18:00.292 --> 01:18:01.917
You got your way, I got mine.

999
01:18:02.127 --> 01:18:04.587
I'm kind of glad
you didn't want to talk.

1000
01:18:04.754 --> 01:18:07.131
Let me just shoot him in the leg.
He'll talk.


1001
01:18:07.507 --> 01:18:09.133
I want the whole package!

1002
01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:10.801
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

1003
01:18:10.969 --> 01:18:12.887
- I don't really care!
- What do you mean?


1004
01:18:13.054 --> 01:18:14.305
What the fuck? You're a cop!

1005
01:18:14.639 --> 01:18:18.475
I was a cop! But because of this dirtbag
and his friends, we're on the run!


1006
01:18:18.935 --> 01:18:20.185
No. It's payback!

1007
01:18:20.437 --> 01:18:21.645
That's enough! I mean it!

1008
01:18:22.772 --> 01:18:24.815
- Is it?
- Oh, man, I heard about you.


1009
01:18:24.983 --> 01:18:27.484
- Did you?
- I heard you were a Section 8.


1010
01:18:27.652 --> 01:18:30.654
I didn't believe that sadistic bullshit
I heard you pulled...


1011
01:18:30.822 --> 01:18:32.364
...but you're for real!

1012
01:18:32.699 --> 01:18:36.201
If you don't want to get sticky,
get back...


1013
01:18:36.369 --> 01:18:37.453
...Jack.

1014
01:18:39.164 --> 01:18:40.706
You got it, sicko.

1015
01:18:42.042 --> 01:18:46.170
You blew it, pal. This asshole's
out of control and I can't stop him.


1016
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:48.380
I'm not going down for this.

1017
01:18:48.673 --> 01:18:50.925
- I'm out of here!
- Don't forget to write!


1018
01:18:51.092 --> 01:18:54.595
You want my vote for the Psycho
Hall of Fame, asshole? You got it!


1019
01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:58.390
You really do look like shit
in a ponytail.


1020
01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:01.977
No. I'm sorry.

1021
01:19:02.145 --> 01:19:04.229
Bye-bye, birdy. Bye, baby!

1022
01:19:05.231 --> 01:19:06.398
I don't wanna hear it.

1023
01:19:07.525 --> 01:19:09.818
Perret! The geezer you want
is Yves Perret!


1024
01:19:09.986 --> 01:19:11.195
Who the hell is Perret?

1025
01:19:11.404 --> 01:19:13.113
The bloke with me in prison.

1026
01:19:13.365 --> 01:19:15.741
- Where's he now?
- The desert. Ryko Aifrield.


1027
01:19:15.992 --> 01:19:17.201
Think he's telling the truth?

1028
01:19:17.369 --> 01:19:19.203
It's not raining
and he's standing in a puddle.


1029
01:19:19.412 --> 01:19:20.537
Disgusting.

1030
01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:24.375
You just fell for the oldest routine
in the book. Bad cop...


1031
01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:25.542
Worse cop!

1032
01:19:28.254 --> 01:19:30.714
- Did you sleep with my sister?
- I don't believe you!


1033
01:19:30.882 --> 01:19:33.133
- Did you two bump uglies with my sister?
- "Bump uglies. "


1034
01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:36.428
- Did you?
- I was so drunk, I don't remember.


1035
01:19:36.721 --> 01:19:38.389
Come on, worse cop, we're late.

1036
01:19:41.393 --> 01:19:43.644
My little contribution to birth control.

1037
01:19:46.398 --> 01:19:47.523
Bloody hell!

1038
01:19:51.778 --> 01:19:53.028
Bloody dud.

1039
01:19:53.405 --> 01:19:56.240
What about my sister?
It's a free country.


1040
01:19:56.408 --> 01:19:58.492
What's that mean?
People are free.


1041
01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.245
So?
So your sister is very free.


1042
01:20:01.413 --> 01:20:02.913
I'm going to kill you.

1043
01:20:03.415 --> 01:20:05.040
Okay, Owen, let's have it.

1044
01:20:13.425 --> 01:20:15.843
- Oh, my...
- God!


1045
01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:18.929
Double-armored, bulletproof glazing.

1046
01:20:19.097 --> 01:20:21.932
120mm cannon on the driver's side.

1047
01:20:22.142 --> 01:20:24.435
Transfer case has torque splitting.

1048
01:20:24.644 --> 01:20:29.106
It'll see 60 in five and a half seconds
and pull high-tens in the quarter.


1049
01:20:29.274 --> 01:20:30.816
What is that?

1050
01:20:31.317 --> 01:20:36.113
That is an RV from hell. 
Care to join me?

1051
01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:38.198
- What do you think?
- I'm impressed.


1052
01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:40.492
- Very impressed?
- Very impressed.


1053
01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:44.288
Does he have gray matter, or what?
Owen, gone! Home run!


1054
01:20:44.456 --> 01:20:47.666
This thing will go through a brick wall.

1055
01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:50.961
We are in business.
- Oh, yeah, we're in business.


1056
01:20:51.129 --> 01:20:54.131
Do you know what kind of firepower
we're talking about here?


1057
01:20:54.299 --> 01:20:57.676
This is a violent work of art!

1058
01:20:57.844 --> 01:20:59.636
Who holds the pink slip? Satan?

1059
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.847
Why don't you take a look inside?

1060
01:21:02.974 --> 01:21:05.976
Isn't this the same guy that invented
your exploding bazooka boots?


1061
01:21:06.144 --> 01:21:09.063
Hey, Owen has milliseconds of genius,
believe me.


1062
01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:10.272
What's this one do?

1063
01:21:10.607 --> 01:21:13.233
Ultra-booster. 
It's nitrous oxide.

1064
01:21:13.485 --> 01:21:15.027
Uh-huh. And what's that mean?

1065
01:21:15.195 --> 01:21:16.987
What's the difference? 
We'll take it.

1066
01:21:17.155 --> 01:21:21.075
No, you can't take that.
It's one of a kind, a prototype.


1067
01:21:21.242 --> 01:21:24.244
Owen, trust us.
We won't put a scratch on it.


1068
01:21:24.496 --> 01:21:25.913
Owen, we're fully insured.

1069
01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:27.831
Fully insured?

1070
01:21:27.999 --> 01:21:30.084
Run this guy Perret
through your computer.


1071
01:21:30.502 --> 01:21:34.797
Okay. I'll see what I
can dig up on him.

1072
01:21:36.382 --> 01:21:37.841
- Cash?
- Yeah?


1073
01:21:38.009 --> 01:21:39.134
Owen's not family, is he?

1074
01:21:40.512 --> 01:21:41.678
Maybe.

1075
01:21:52.857 --> 01:21:56.235
Ryko Airfield was abandoned 10 years ago.

1076
01:21:56.528 --> 01:21:59.905
It s in private hands now.
There's been a lot of construction...


1077
01:22:00.073 --> 01:22:03.700
...but look for a main building
about a mile in from the perimeter.


1078
01:22:03.868 --> 01:22:05.536
Thanks, Owen.

1079
01:22:23.888 --> 01:22:25.055
Looks quiet.

1080
01:22:29.394 --> 01:22:30.978
This is insane.

1081
01:22:33.439 --> 01:22:34.773
Very insane.

1082
01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.819
You get the feeling
things are about to get bloody?


1083
01:22:41.197 --> 01:22:42.739
They could.

1084
01:22:43.908 --> 01:22:48.495
If one of us doesn't make it back,
I just want you to know that...


1085
01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.831
...you're the best cop
I ever worked with.


1086
01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.921
There's something
I want you to know, Ray.


1087
01:23:00.425 --> 01:23:03.468
If you don't make
it back and I do...

1088
01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:06.263
...I am gonna date your sister.

1089
01:23:14.606 --> 01:23:16.607
Look, Cash, I got nothing against you.

1090
01:23:19.611 --> 01:23:23.697
But I don't want Catherine getting
that 2-in-the-morning phone call...


1091
01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:25.866
...saying something's happened to you.

1092
01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:29.286
If she has to live with that,
it would kill me.


1093
01:23:29.954 --> 01:23:32.831
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
I'm charmed.


1094
01:23:36.127 --> 01:23:39.463
I'll tell you what. 
I'll stay away...

1095
01:23:39.631 --> 01:23:43.467
...until you give me your blessing.
Fair enough?


1096
01:23:43.801 --> 01:23:45.594
In that case...

1097
01:23:45.762 --> 01:23:47.638
...never.
- Thought so.


1098
01:23:48.473 --> 01:23:51.308
Let's go to work.
Something's coming over the computer.


1099
01:23:51.476 --> 01:23:54.144
It's Owen with that information on Perret.

1100
01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.786
- We're at the location.
- Coming up on a very serious gate.


1101
01:24:11.204 --> 01:24:13.538
- Is this place fortified?
- Don't know for sure.


1102
01:24:13.915 --> 01:24:15.499
Better use extreme caution.

1103
01:24:15.667 --> 01:24:17.084
- Cash?
- Yeah?


1104
01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.418
Listen to the man.

1105
01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:20.754
Yes, Mommy.

1106
01:24:26.135 --> 01:24:27.469
Oh, my God!

1107
01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:33.141
Subtle! Real subtle!

1108
01:24:33.351 --> 01:24:34.393
We're in!

1109
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:41.942
Get the hell out of here!

1110
01:24:57.542 --> 01:24:58.792
Come on.

1111
01:25:00.378 --> 01:25:02.838
Where the hell are we?
It looks like a goddamn pit!


1112
01:25:15.476 --> 01:25:16.518
Come on!

1113
01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:20.731
Cash, watch the right!

1114
01:25:27.238 --> 01:25:28.530
Your left!

1115
01:25:31.951 --> 01:25:33.744
- I'm gonna go for it!
- Cash, no!


1116
01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:34.953
- Yes!
- No!


1117
01:25:35.121 --> 01:25:36.163
Yes!

1118
01:25:47.925 --> 01:25:49.217
Subtle! Real subtle!

1119
01:25:49.427 --> 01:25:50.719
Where'd you learn to drive?

1120
01:25:50.928 --> 01:25:52.054
Stevie Wonder.

1121
01:25:56.517 --> 01:25:58.477
- We're on fire!
- Yeah, we're cooking now!


1122
01:26:03.608 --> 01:26:06.360
- It's a dead end!
- We're in a goddamn maze!


1123
01:26:11.282 --> 01:26:13.950
- We're blocked in!
- This son of a bitch is playing with us!


1124
01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:24.127
Oh, shit!

1125
01:26:27.673 --> 01:26:29.007
Come on!

1126
01:26:29.342 --> 01:26:30.759
Get the sons of bitches!

1127
01:26:39.477 --> 01:26:42.604
- Do you want the good news or bad news?
- The bad.


1128
01:26:42.772 --> 01:26:43.855
We're almost out of gas.

1129
01:26:45.858 --> 01:26:48.235
- The good?
- We're almost out of gas.


1130
01:26:58.579 --> 01:27:00.539
What's this guy own, a used-car lot?

1131
01:27:01.624 --> 01:27:02.749
Come on!

1132
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:08.213
Bring them in!

1133
01:27:18.975 --> 01:27:21.601
All right!
That's gotta be the last of them!


1134
01:27:21.853 --> 01:27:23.270
Home team!

1135
01:27:23.646 --> 01:27:25.272
- Behind you!
- What the hell is that?


1136
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.190
Not the Welcome Wagon!

1137
01:27:30.486 --> 01:27:32.404
- We gotta bail!
- What was that noise?


1138
01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:35.115
Don't worry, Owen. 
A few speed bumps!

1139
01:27:42.582 --> 01:27:44.791
- Let's get out of here!
- I need a gun!


1140
01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:46.793
You guys aren't holding out
on me, are you?


1141
01:27:47.044 --> 01:27:49.463
- Here.
- Why is yours bigger than mine?


1142
01:27:50.047 --> 01:27:51.131
Genetics, peewee.

1143
01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:39.554
OwEN: Why aren't you guys
talking to me anymore? Say something.


1144
01:28:54.779 --> 01:28:56.446
Perret's gotta be in there.

1145
01:28:56.697 --> 01:28:59.074
Must be. It's the only building left standing.

1146
01:28:59.325 --> 01:29:01.243
Any chance he might surrender?

1147
01:29:02.578 --> 01:29:03.912
Not likely.

1148
01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.872
Remember...

1149
01:29:06.123 --> 01:29:07.874
...use extreme caution.

1150
01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:10.919
Ciao.

1151
01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:35.337
Nice collection.

1152
01:30:35.504 --> 01:30:37.589
Yeah, toys for tots.

1153
01:30:38.382 --> 01:30:40.550
No more owes-ies. We're even.

1154
01:30:40.718 --> 01:30:42.927
How do you figure?
I just saved your life.


1155
01:30:43.095 --> 01:30:44.596
We'll discuss it later.

1156
01:30:45.014 --> 01:30:47.932
- Let them come, Mr. Perret.
- We are ready.


1157
01:30:58.903 --> 01:30:59.986
Bombs for tots.

1158
01:31:01.405 --> 01:31:03.657
Facility destruct sequence...

1159
01:31:03.824 --> 01:31:06.326
...is now engaged.
- Cash!


1160
01:31:07.036 --> 01:31:09.245
This clock works backwards
or somebody activated a bomb.


1161
01:31:09.413 --> 01:31:11.331
Yeah, wonder who.

1162
01:31:15.961 --> 01:31:18.421
- How do we stop it?
- We don't. Let's get Perret.


1163
01:31:18.589 --> 01:31:20.882
Get me a toy too.

1164
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:23.051
Tango, we only got 11 minutes.

1165
01:31:23.219 --> 01:31:25.011
Raiders scored three touchdowns
in 11 minutes.


1166
01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:27.138
Yeah, but they had three time-outs.

1167
01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:08.722
Clip.

1168
01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:15.854
Look out!

1169
01:32:22.778 --> 01:32:24.237
- You okay, Cash?
- Yeah, clean exit.


1170
01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.865
You're lucky.
I've been shot plenty of times.


1171
01:32:27.032 --> 01:32:28.491
I never felt lucky about it.

1172
01:32:28.659 --> 01:32:30.368
Stop complaining.

1173
01:32:32.538 --> 01:32:34.581
- Right side.
Got it.


1174
01:32:38.461 --> 01:32:41.004
He has a hell of a hobby!
We got our own TV show.


1175
01:32:41.464 --> 01:32:43.006
What do you think?

1176
01:32:43.174 --> 01:32:44.758
I think we better get the hell out.

1177
01:32:46.302 --> 01:32:48.136
Not yet. Game's just starting.

1178
01:32:50.222 --> 01:32:51.598
Over here.

1179
01:32:54.518 --> 01:32:55.977
Let her go!

1180
01:33:02.234 --> 01:33:03.735
All right, Requin.

1181
01:33:04.737 --> 01:33:07.697
You want me? You got me.

1182
01:33:08.157 --> 01:33:09.991
I got you both now, don't I?

1183
01:33:10.201 --> 01:33:11.743
Two for the price of one.

1184
01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:14.412
Pretty boy's trying to
get the drop on me.


1185
01:33:14.663 --> 01:33:18.541
Drop your fucking gun
or I'll drop sister here!


1186
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:20.293
Drop your gun, Cash.

1187
01:33:21.003 --> 01:33:22.086
I can take him.

1188
01:33:22.338 --> 01:33:23.797
Cash!

1189
01:33:24.006 --> 01:33:25.465
Drop your goddamn gun!

1190
01:33:25.716 --> 01:33:27.258
I drop it...

1191
01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.261
...and we're both dead and you know it.

1192
01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:33.556
If you don't drop
it, we all go up.

1193
01:33:34.225 --> 01:33:35.767
Recognize plan B?

1194
01:33:37.561 --> 01:33:39.312
She fancies me.

1195
01:33:39.563 --> 01:33:42.106
She might even lose her head over me.
Know what I mean?


1196
01:33:43.025 --> 01:33:45.443
You don't know my mate here.

1197
01:33:45.611 --> 01:33:48.196
He's looking forward
to kicking your brains in.


1198
01:33:48.447 --> 01:33:49.697
Ain't you, Sonny?

1199
01:33:49.949 --> 01:33:51.032
Well, pretty boy...

1200
01:33:51.450 --> 01:33:53.743
...I'd like you to watch me...

1201
01:33:53.994 --> 01:33:56.788
...pleasure your sister slow and easy.

1202
01:33:57.081 --> 01:34:00.375
But I only got a few minutes
to carve you up!


1203
01:34:51.635 --> 01:34:54.429
We never talked about plan C, asshole.

1204
01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:01.060
Think it's a dud?

1205
01:35:10.988 --> 01:35:13.740
- FUBAR. Bigtime.
- We gotta find Catherine.


1206
01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:20.997
When the Great Scorer comes
to write against your name, he'll mark...


1207
01:35:21.165 --> 01:35:23.458
...not that you won or lost...

1208
01:35:23.667 --> 01:35:25.919
...but how you played the game.

1209
01:35:26.462 --> 01:35:27.795
What bullshit!

1210
01:35:28.172 --> 01:35:30.715
- Shit!
- This game has cost me a lot.


1211
01:35:31.133 --> 01:35:34.052
- I'll blow this maniac into the ozone.
- You gotta know which one he is.


1212
01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:36.054
I do.

1213
01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.222
I leave you with this thought, gentlemen.

1214
01:35:38.724 --> 01:35:40.934
- Great. All you need now is a gun.
- Got it.


1215
01:35:42.645 --> 01:35:43.978
So do I.

1216
01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:47.148
All right, let's take him alive.

1217
01:35:47.358 --> 01:35:49.025
- Kneecaps on three.
- Call it.


1218
01:35:49.193 --> 01:35:50.526
One...

1219
01:35:52.696 --> 01:35:54.197
Two!

1220
01:36:03.832 --> 01:36:06.209
- My sights are off.
- Mine too.


1221
01:36:07.044 --> 01:36:08.711
Cash, get the door!

1222
01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.255
Hurry up!

1223
01:36:15.344 --> 01:36:16.844
- She all right?
- She's coming to.


1224
01:36:17.012 --> 01:36:18.721
- How'd you know who to shoot?
- The ring.


1225
01:36:18.889 --> 01:36:20.431
- No, the monogram.
- Monogram?


1226
01:36:20.599 --> 01:36:21.683
It was reversed.

1227
01:36:22.184 --> 01:36:24.227
- What about the ring?
- On the wrong hand.


1228
01:36:24.395 --> 01:36:27.355
Are we clever or what?
Let's blow this place.


1229
01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.116
20 seconds, Cash.

1230
01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:08.896
There's a lot of new pollution
in the sky tonight and they call it Perret.


1231
01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:11.691
Kiki, are you okay?

1232
01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:14.610
Oh, yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just worried about you.


1233
01:37:14.778 --> 01:37:17.905
Thanks. I'll probably lose my arm
on account of saving him.


1234
01:37:18.073 --> 01:37:20.116
Catherine, come on, it's a scratch.

1235
01:37:20.284 --> 01:37:22.869
Cash, you got sloppy and stumbled.

1236
01:37:23.078 --> 01:37:25.955
Sloppy? I took that hit for you!

1237
01:37:26.123 --> 01:37:29.333
After all I've done for you,
you're still ungrateful.


1238
01:37:29.585 --> 01:37:31.127
- Done for me?
Yeah.


1239
01:37:31.295 --> 01:37:32.879
Guys, this is no time to argue.

1240
01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:35.631
He just can't accept
that he's the number two cop.


1241
01:37:35.799 --> 01:37:37.842
It's very hard for him to handle.

1242
01:37:38.177 --> 01:37:41.721
Dream on.
You got your version, I got the truth.


1243
01:37:42.097 --> 01:37:45.641
Why don't you just admit it,
that you guys work well together.


1244
01:37:46.268 --> 01:37:48.603
No matter what you say, Ray...

1245
01:37:48.812 --> 01:37:52.190
...I've at least earned the right
to date your sister.


1246
01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:57.403
- Over my dead body.
- Deal?


1247
01:43:39.955 --> 01:43:41.956
