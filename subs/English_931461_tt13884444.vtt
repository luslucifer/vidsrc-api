00:26:04.505 --> 00:26:05.739
Yeah.

479
00:26:05.806 --> 00:26:07.941
I, um... haven't had a chance
to read it yet.


480
00:26:08.008 --> 00:26:10.477
I had a wild few days, Craig.

481
00:26:10.544 --> 00:26:12.646
I moved.
I bought a house.


482
00:26:12.713 --> 00:26:13.814
[chuckles]

483
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:16.216
Shiitake mushrooms,
congratulations.


484
00:26:17.551 --> 00:26:21.388
Let me be the bearer of
even more fantastic news.


485
00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:25.092
Lot B, spot 334, right behind
the humanities building.


486
00:26:25.159 --> 00:26:26.795
Don't tickle my nuts here,
Craig.


487
00:26:26.894 --> 00:26:28.028
No, no.

488
00:26:28.095 --> 00:26:29.997
This is not a nut-tickling,
as you say.


489
00:26:30.064 --> 00:26:31.632
It goes on the rear
right bumper.


490
00:26:31.699 --> 00:26:32.700
[chuckles]

491
00:26:32.767 --> 00:26:34.068
Don't mess that up.

492
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.302
They're absolutely Gestapo
about sticker placement.


493
00:26:35.369 --> 00:26:36.970
Where does one put this
on a scooter?


494
00:26:37.037 --> 00:26:39.340
Scooter... hmm,
doesn't go on a scooter.


495
00:26:39.406 --> 00:26:42.443
You have a 1984 Saab 900,
license plate B4...


496
00:26:42.509 --> 00:26:43.745
I sold the car.

497
00:26:43.812 --> 00:26:44.912
You sold the car?

498
00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:46.280
I wanted a more
fuel-efficient option.


499
00:26:46.347 --> 00:26:48.449
Shite. Screw me running.
Phil, I...


500
00:26:48.515 --> 00:26:49.616
Craig!

501
00:26:49.683 --> 00:26:50.819
Uh, please release.
Release.


502
00:26:50.884 --> 00:26:52.086
So Lot B, it's, uh...

503
00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:53.620
it's for cars only,
it's not a scooter lot.


504
00:26:53.687 --> 00:26:56.758
And the flipping sticker is
registered to your Saab plates.


505
00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:58.525
What does it matter?
It's still my vehicle.


506
00:26:58.592 --> 00:27:00.928
Parking spots are like kidney
transplants around here. Okay?


507
00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:02.963
Now you have to register
for the scooter lot.


508
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.264
Who knows how long that'll take.

509
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.166
Scooter drivers tend to be
a lot younger.


510
00:27:06.233 --> 00:27:08.535
Three years of work on this.
My day's shot, Phil!


511
00:27:08.602 --> 00:27:10.170
It's absolutely shot!

512
00:27:11.773 --> 00:27:16.110
[keyboard tapping]

513
00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:18.879
Oh shit, shit.
What... what?


514
00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:22.216
Out, out, out.
Off! Off, off, off!


515
00:27:22.282 --> 00:27:23.283
Ah, God...

516
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.386
You should probably watch that
in private.


517
00:27:25.452 --> 00:27:26.353
It's not what you think.

518
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.287
No, no, it's okay.

519
00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:31.425
I, uh... I prefer
older partners.


520
00:27:31.492 --> 00:27:32.794
What?

521
00:27:32.861 --> 00:27:34.796
Can I buy you a beer?

522
00:27:34.863 --> 00:27:36.296
Why would you do that?

523
00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:38.298
Because it's not every day
you see your favorite professor


524
00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:40.968
out and about in
a social setting.


525
00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:42.336
Your favorite professor?

526
00:27:42.403 --> 00:27:43.604
By far.

527
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.874
That's very kind of you.

528
00:27:45.939 --> 00:27:47.374
What makes you say that?

529
00:27:47.441 --> 00:27:49.410
You're not that insecure,
are you?


530
00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:50.511
What? No.

531
00:27:50.577 --> 00:27:52.946
It's a little embarrassing,
but I'll say it.


532
00:27:53.013 --> 00:27:55.750
You're the reason
I'm into economics.


533
00:27:55.817 --> 00:27:57.384
Don't tell me any more.

534
00:27:57.451 --> 00:27:58.452
[chuckles]

535
00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:00.187
Your master's thesis
on the economic plight


536
00:28:00.254 --> 00:28:04.525
of the middle American coal
miner was poetry, pure poetry.


537
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.226
You read my master's thesis?

538
00:28:06.293 --> 00:28:08.395
It's on my bedside table.

539
00:28:09.263 --> 00:28:12.633
I'm with some friends.
We're all in your class.


540
00:28:12.699 --> 00:28:14.201
Come on, let me buy you a beer

541
00:28:14.268 --> 00:28:17.204
and I'll tell you
how wonderful you are.


542
00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:23.177
In the history of mankind,

543
00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:30.584
humankind, in every great story,
in every great film...


544
00:28:30.651 --> 00:28:34.288
the hero wants two things.

545
00:28:34.354 --> 00:28:38.827
Number one, and this is by far
the most important,


546
00:28:38.893 --> 00:28:41.061
he wants to go home.

547
00:28:41.128 --> 00:28:43.564
Even LeBron James,
the king himself,


548
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.299
changed the course of his career

549
00:28:45.365 --> 00:28:50.003
by bringing a championship
to his hometown of Cleveland.


550
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.205
Cleveland!

551
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:53.942
Nobody wants to live
in Cleveland!


552
00:28:54.007 --> 00:28:57.678
And I, your humble cultural
economics professor,


553
00:28:57.745 --> 00:28:59.914
have liquidated everything.

554
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.615
All for the dream of going home.

555
00:29:01.682 --> 00:29:04.318
The power of four walls
and a patch of grass.


556
00:29:04.384 --> 00:29:07.621
American dream is as alive today
as it's ever been.


557
00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:11.391
What's number two?

558
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.461
Come here.

559
00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:16.497
Shh.

560
00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:20.667
The sandwich.

561
00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:21.769
Ahh...

562
00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.872
Everybody wants a sandwich.

563
00:29:23.938 --> 00:29:25.974
That is so true.

564
00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:28.008
I'm so hungry.

565
00:29:28.075 --> 00:29:30.210
[all laugh]

566
00:29:30.277 --> 00:29:31.578
Imagine.

567
00:29:34.348 --> 00:29:36.350
[laughing]
Oh, my God.


568
00:29:36.416 --> 00:29:39.921
Dr. Loder... you are officially
my favorite professor.


569
00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:41.455
You must be a freshman.

570
00:29:41.522 --> 00:29:45.459
Cultural economics?
It's like watching paint dry.


571
00:29:45.526 --> 00:29:47.427
[both laughing]

572
00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:48.963
[male student]
I don't know you,


573
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:50.765
but I actually really like
cultural economics.


574
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:52.000
[female student] You do?

575
00:29:52.065 --> 00:29:53.333
Youth of the world, so free.

576
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.635
So dumb.

577
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:56.336
Absolutely brainless.

578
00:29:58.405 --> 00:29:59.172
Uh...

579
00:29:59.239 --> 00:30:01.375
You wanna share a ride home?

580
00:30:02.744 --> 00:30:04.012
It's likely not on the way.

581
00:30:04.077 --> 00:30:06.079
We could just go to your place.

582
00:30:10.417 --> 00:30:12.553
I'm your professor, Claire.
You're a student.


583
00:30:12.619 --> 00:30:14.488
There's an unwritten
code of ethics.


584
00:30:14.555 --> 00:30:17.591
Actually, there's a written
code, to be clear.


585
00:30:17.658 --> 00:30:20.527
You are... young.

586
00:30:20.594 --> 00:30:23.664
I'm a graduate student.

587
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:24.866
You are?

588
00:30:24.933 --> 00:30:27.301
Yeah. And I'm 30.

589
00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:28.335
Oh shit.

590
00:30:28.402 --> 00:30:29.904
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[chuckles] Shit.


591
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:33.373
So, you know, technically,
I'm not a 'student' student.


592
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.379
I'm a consenting adult who
happens to be taking your class


593
00:30:39.446 --> 00:30:44.184
and who happens to be
really, really into you.


594
00:30:47.287 --> 00:30:49.089
[Phil] That's... that's
impressive, Claire.


595
00:30:49.156 --> 00:30:50.058
[Claire] Oh, wow.

596
00:30:50.123 --> 00:30:51.325
[Phil] Oh, jeez.

597
00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.929
Are you okay?

598
00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:57.197
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's
just, uh...


599
00:30:57.264 --> 00:30:58.532
I didn't expect it to be so...

600
00:30:58.599 --> 00:31:01.268
Yeah, it's a common
misconception.


601
00:31:01.335 --> 00:31:03.637
An unfair stereotype, actually.

602
00:31:03.704 --> 00:31:08.141
It's the unconscious bias that's
plaguing society's perception


603
00:31:08.208 --> 00:31:09.443
in a clandestine way.

604
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:11.813
You know, it's a logical
conclusion, given a...


605
00:31:11.879 --> 00:31:13.113
You talk too much.

606
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.482
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to go
with the flow.


607
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:17.684
I can't believe
this is happening.


608
00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:19.854
Oh...

609
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:21.321
The coal miner didn't set out
to poison his lungs


610
00:31:21.388 --> 00:31:23.323
with the black soot
of capitalism.


611
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.461
He set out, like all hardworking
middle Americans did,


612
00:31:27.527 --> 00:31:29.262
to burrow a path to freedom.

613
00:31:29.329 --> 00:31:31.966
[together] A freedom
he would never realize...


614
00:31:32.033 --> 00:31:35.535
at the cost of his own virility.

615
00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:36.637
Yeah.

616
00:31:37.772 --> 00:31:39.239
-It's poetry.
-Yeah.


617
00:31:41.743 --> 00:31:43.710
Ow! Ow, ow.

618
00:31:43.778 --> 00:31:45.412
It's poetry.

619
00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:46.480
Oh, God.

620
00:31:48.382 --> 00:31:49.449
[Claire] Wanna see
something fun?


621
00:31:49.516 --> 00:31:50.384
[Phil] Yeah.

622
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.486
Whoa! Oh, gosh,
that's unexpected.


623
00:31:53.153 --> 00:31:55.089
-[woodpecker tapping]
-[knock at door]


624
00:31:55.155 --> 00:31:56.323
Someone's at the door.

625
00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.358
No, it's a woodpecker.

626
00:32:02.229 --> 00:32:03.530
It sounds like knocking.

627
00:32:03.597 --> 00:32:05.699
That's what they do.
It's called drumming.


628
00:32:05.767 --> 00:32:10.138
It's repetitive, pecking
at a resonant object.


629
00:32:10.203 --> 00:32:11.672
Good morning, Mr. Loder.

630
00:32:11.738 --> 00:32:12.706
Whoa!

631
00:32:12.774 --> 00:32:13.775
Good morning.

632
00:32:13.841 --> 00:32:14.842
Oh!

633
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:16.309
Is this a bad time?

634
00:32:16.376 --> 00:32:18.578
Well, you just walked
right in here, didn't you?


635
00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:21.481
I, uh, knocked.
I was knocking.


636
00:32:23.084 --> 00:32:26.788
Do you want your shower fixed
or what?


637
00:32:26.854 --> 00:32:29.222
