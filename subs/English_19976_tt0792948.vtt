1
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.410
The lampposts are in need..

2
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.250
The lampposts are in need
of their long scarlet coats


3
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.690
Start

4
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.650
Roger.

5
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.170
My grandmother

6
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.290
I have to go see her.

7
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.050
What's the matter?

8
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.770
I've got to see grandma right now.

9
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.890
She's dying at the hospital
I haven't been to see her


10
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.730
Your grandmother died 10 years ago.

11
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.290
-Go back To sleep and leave me alone
-I have to go


12
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.410
I have to go to the hospital

13
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.770
She raised me

14
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.410
She loves me more than my parents

15
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.770
Francois...

16
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.650
Grandma! This unbelievable!

17
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.010
I was just coming to see you.

18
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.810
Don't be afraid.

19
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.490
I'm not afraid

20
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.690
Your wife is right. I'm dead.

21
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.930
Is that a dream?

22
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.730
I came to warn you.

23
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.890
You have to watch out for your self.

24
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.970
You've always been too curious.

25
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.330
But this time you might set
off the infernal machine.


26
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.450
What are you talking about Grandma?

27
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.450
From where I am
it's diffucult and dagerous to help you.


28
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.850
Dammit, stop muttering to yourself.

29
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.530
I need my sleep.

30
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.610
The great white walls are inundated

31
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.570
in a vast tragic happiness.
Three times.


32
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.450
The blood of airports

33
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.650
Can no longer bear the snow

34
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.330
Flooding the blue grass. One time.

35
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.450
I repeat: The blood of airports

36
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.770
can no longer bear the snow
flooding the blue grass.


37
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.570
One time.

38
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.770
You're in a bad mood.

39
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.490
I'm fed up.

40
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.810
I'm ashamed of what i do

41
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.890
This one will be too easy

42
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.570
Why bother with him upstairs?

43
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.370
You and your "why"!
How should I know?


44
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.770
Mind your own business and obey orders
without wrguing. Period.


45
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.970
And if I don't obey?

46
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.850
You Know what will Happen

47
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.890
We're not angels anymore

48
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.570
-But we're no witches either.
-Yeah right!


49
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.690
Fallen angels,
doomed to obey.


50
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.890
Cut the crap
and get to work, old girl.


51
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.250
Don't treat him too cruelly.

52
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.450
Francois is an odd mixture
of intelligence and foolishness


53
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.370
But he's a child.

54
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.250
Observe this young woman.

55
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.690
Listen to her. 
She'll inspire you.

56
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.250
She'll make you famous.

57
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.210
So, how was I?

58
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.970
Lovely.
Amazing how far you went.


59
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.610
-Was I wrong to?
Not Necessarily.


60
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.530
I repeat: you were lovely.

61
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.210
When I came to your door
I was so scared I wanted to run.


62
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.210
I love your films

63
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.890
I wanted to try out for you
even if I had no expectations.


64
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.690
Only five of you
are up for the part.


65
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.130
I was preparing a thriller.

66
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.330
I normally run screen tests

67
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.810
using the hardest scenes.

68
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.210
This time I'd chosen two scenes.

69
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.690
One was pretty erotic,
the one Virginie had just done.


70
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.090
You Know, I'm a blueblood.

71
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.050
I was raised to see sexual pleasure
as taboo to a decent woman.


72
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.010
So, I never had an orgasm.
Untill today


73
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.370
When my boyfriend wants me,
he jumps me and its over in a flash.


74
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.890
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.
I'm I boring you?


75
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.850
Not at all.

76
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.850
So when I came to your door,
I wanted to run.


77
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.450
Why do you do tests here?

78
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.890
I couldn't use the office,
your place, or mine.


79
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.610
Why the erotic tests first?

80
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.690
To give you a chance to bow out.

81
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.250
You said if I was embarrassed,

82
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.730
I should sublimate it
and turn it into pleasure,


83
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.050
then let the feeling carry me.

84
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.810
And go even further.

85
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.450
I obeyed again.

86
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.610
Then my mind went blank
and I tottaly forgot about you.


87
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.690
I know you didn't ask for that,

88
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.610
but the truth is I felt real pleasure.

89
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.770
Extremely intense pleasure, even.

90
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.210
I never imagined anything so intense.

91
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.570
Even in my dreams.

92
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.170
So was it your first orgasm?

93
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.210
I just said it was.

94
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.370
Why is that?

95
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.690
Rubbing myself in front of you
was already an exciting taboo.


96
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.050
Plus, I don't know you.
That makes it stronger.


97
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.410
I could fantasize about you,
knowing you wouldn't touch me.


98
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.130
I pictured you

99
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.330
aroused,

100
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.210
and burning with the desire to take me

101
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.250
You might have been wrong.

102
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.050
You're not a rapist.

103
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.570
What do you feel now?

104
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.290
I don't know.

105
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.010
Shame?

106
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:26.930
No

107
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.730
The feeling of having been lured

108
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.450
into lewdness?

109
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.410
And it wouldn't be your fault.

110
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.250
I came for a test.
I knew what I was doing


111
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.530
And it was all very exciting

112
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.370
A learning experience

113
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.810
A bit like a revelation

114
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.810
about my forbidden self

115
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.610
Are you sorry?

116
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.970
Not for now.

117
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.410
At least I'm glad you had pleasure,

118
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.530
however unexpected.

119
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.650
Promise me that what I've said
remains our secret.


120
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.330
I promise.
Now if you're not too tired,


121
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:05.850
we'll move on

122
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.490
to a dialogue reading.

123
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.890
It's a hard scene.

124
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.050
Another actreee was slightly better

125
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.410
and I made the film
without Virginie.


126
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.570
But I was haunted

127
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.130
by what she had confided in me.

128
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.410
Especially since I ran into her
two years later.


129
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.970
She gave me a cold look

130
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.650
and accused me
of having traumatized her.


131
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.450
Why this complete change of attitude?

132
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.730
During the screen test,

133
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.010
had this young woman made things up
to get the role?


134
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.290
As a filmmaker, I took actors' talk
and moods with a grain of salt.


135
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.570
But I was sure at the time

136
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.610
that Virginie had spoken in earnest.

137
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.210
Those confidences made me want
to make an experimental film


138
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.970
about taboos and pleasure.

139
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.330
I had a producer.

140
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.570
Please sit down

141
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.410
Young lady, I may frighten you.

142
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.410
-Listen...
-My name is Olivia


143
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.170
Olivia, I'm doing a film about female
pleasure and transgressing taboos.


144
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.530
I need actresses willing

145
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.410
to be arousing on camera.

146
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.330
Meaning?

147
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.490
What is arousing in life?

148
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.130
We're aroused when we dare do
little erotic things


149
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.050
that we've banned from our minds,

150
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.570
but which we're still dying to try...

151
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.250
like masturbating for a stranger
in a hotel room,


152
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.810
in a school or street.

153
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.810
In the film, I'd need
the actresses' connivance


154
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.930
about their desires,

155
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.810
their secret experiences.

156
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.850
It leaves room for improvisation.

157
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.890
That frighten you?

158
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.090
I mean, yes, a bit.

159
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.810
Do I have to do tests?

160
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:19.530
What kind?

161
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.050
Ones Involving the key scenes.

162
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.290
Meaning?

163
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.450
Probably rubbing yourself.

164
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.650
And, not being a lesbian, making love
with a woman for the kick of it.


165
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.290
You have to be arousing.
But there's no sex with a man.


166
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.730
What does "arousing mena?
That I have to have an orgasm?


167
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.370
At least create

168
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.930
the illusion
as authentically as possible.


169
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.570
Especially for the rising pleasure.

170
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.890
What are you testing?

171
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.970
An actress's sesnuality.

172
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.610
Some girls are wxciting, others no.
Especially on screen.


173
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.050
Excuse me for being so blunt.

174
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.050
Even if I do erotic scenes for you
that doesn't mean I;ll repeat them


175
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.810
in front of a crew.

176
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.010
Then why do it for me?

177
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.450
But you're right.

178
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.170
Girls often have last-minute qualms.

179
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.490
That's why I have to test
an actress's potential for exhibitionism.


180
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.170
hence, the video tests.

181
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.010
Is there any dialogue in your film?

182
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.090
Sure, and difficult dialogue at that.

183
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.210
I can't allow myself
to make a porn movie.


184
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.250
Nor can my actresses.
We're all on a high wire.


185
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.250
What I'm out to capture...

186
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.210
is the grace of the pleasure
on their faces


187
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.970
and their bodies.

188
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.090
Pleasure...

189
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.930
To express it,
you have to know what it is.


190
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.210
Why not take porn stars
and teach them how to act?


191
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.650
They take no delight in transgression.

192
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.490
I think I know
what you're looking for.


193
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.650
My boyfriend once took me
to a swingers' club.


194
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.690
I hated the place

195
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.170
But at one point I saw two girls.

196
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.970
They were lying on the floor

197
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.090
and one was kissing
the other girl's pussy.


198
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.770
So I stopped to watch them

199
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:31.290
I could see the mounting pleasure
of the girl who was being...


200
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.330
licked.

201
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.170
She was very beautiful.

202
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.410
I was fascinated by the way
her body moved.


203
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.570
before and during orgasm.

204
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.330
It was beautiful.

205
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.930
I suddenly realized
I was very excited


206
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.690
and envious of her.

207
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.130
yet I'm no lesbian.

208
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.010
To be frank,

209
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.690
just talking about it
excites me a little.


210
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.650
Isn't that the kind of excitement
you want to film?


211
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.410
By making a real film.

212
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.370
I'll try to create sensual tension,
mixed with poetry and suspence.


213
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.770
It's never been done.

214
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.530
Will it be shown in theaters?
On TV?


215
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.810
Both I hope.

216
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.490
I've never made love with a woman.

217
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.730
Actually, I have.

218
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.610
When I was 13,
with a girl my age.


219
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.610
I don't think it would thrill me now.

220
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.650
At the same time,

221
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.530
I'm tempted to do it,

222
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.810
but I'm afraid of how my family
would take it.


223
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.970
Especially my father.

224
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.090
Your idea is very interesting.

225
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.450
It's original and involves us all.

226
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.850
What's more, you listen to us,

227
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.890
you care about us.

228
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.970
We immediately feel
like confiding in you.


229
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.490
But to be honest,
doing sex scenes scares me.


230
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.770
I don't dare.

231
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.410
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.010
Goodbye.

233
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.090
Too bad for my film.

234
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.610
Really, no.

235
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.530
...a stranger in a hotel?

236
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.010
Not even a screen test?

237
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.090
...a woman, for the pleasure
of the experience?


238
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.290
Honestly?

239
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.810
For the thrill of breaking taboo?

240
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.290
in a hotel for instance?

241
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.930
Are you a lesbian?

242
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.250
In front of the camera?

243
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.370
You're the filmmaker?

244
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.090
My name is Julie

245
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.450
I heard you were preparing a film.
Can I speak with you?


246
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.610
Let's sit down.

247
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.170
I'm getting discouraged.

248
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.250
Why?

249
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.010
The actresses are all scared
by the tests or the project.


250
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.450
I can understand them.

251
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.370
But it's my current project.
I have nothing else going.


252
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.370
You know, your tests...

253
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.930
You can do them with me.
I swear you can.


254
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.650
I've heard about you.
You do serious work.


255
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.130
I trust you.

256
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.530
Besides.

257
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.250
I have nothing to lose.

258
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.490
Was I good?

259
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.490
No. I can tell from your face.

260
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.130
If I'd had the initiative,
i'd have been more intense.


261
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.090
Don't say a thing. You'll see.

262
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.610
I use this to make myself come.

263
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.970
Here goes.

264
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.770
After that,
you should give yourself a rest.


265
00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.410
I can do it right away.

266
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.090
Once when i was 12 or 13,

267
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.250
I put it in so far
I couldn't get it out.


268
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.690
I had to get
my mother to help me.

269
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.370
She pretended not to understand.

270
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.330
How did she go about helping you?

271
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.250
How do you think?

272
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.610
It's starting.

273
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.010
With my ball, it starts right off.

274
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.210
Sometimes, too fast.

275
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.410
Yu can talk to me,
tell me I'm beautiful.


276
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.210
But I won't answer you.

277
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.850
I don't want to show myself naked.

278
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.410
It's your right.
I asked for nothing.


279
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.370
Good.

280
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.570
Can I stay and talk?

281
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.650
if you like.

282
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.970
I have two favors to ask you.
Do you mind?


283
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.090
try me.

284
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.330
I'm majoring in modern lit.

285
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.290
I have to do a paper
on dramatic construction.


286
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.850
Do you have any reference books?

287
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.450
There are two essays
in the complete works of Corneille


288
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.490
on the compsition
of dramatic poetry,


289
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.010
which are still topical.

290
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.530
The second book is a fine study
of vlassical tragedy.


291
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.770
-Can I borrow them?
-If I get them back.


292
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.730
Without fail. Next week.

293
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.690
As for the second favor...

294
00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.970
My guy's not enterprising.

295
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.050
Maybe he doesn't like romance.

296
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.850
You mean, sex?

297
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.730
Teach me how to have an orgasm.

298
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.650
Just by explaining it to me, i mean.

299
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.410
Young lady ask your friend.

300
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.570
Maybe I'm not sexy enough for him.

301
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.050
Not skillful enough.

302
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.050
To do what?

303
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.850
My vamp act.

304
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.530
And you think I can help you?

305
00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.570
Sure.
You see lots of girls every day.


306
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.730
You're the ideal judge.

307
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:07.810
I can show you what I do for him
and you can tell me about my sex appeal.


308
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.930
Anyway it's 1.30.
Everyone's out to lunch.


309
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.850
We'll be left in peace.

310
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.170
Nobody will come bother you.

311
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.850
But you really think
I'm the right person for this?


312
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.810
Who else?

313
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.610
Here I go...

314
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.530
Can i put on Some music?

315
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.490
So?

316
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.170
Was I sexy or not?

317
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.050
I'll return your books next week.

318
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.770
I do that for my boyfriend,
for him only.


319
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.050
I won't do your film.

320
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.050
That much I understood.

321
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.930
Rebecca?

322
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.810
-It's nice to see you.
-Same here.


323
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:30.730
Got five minutes?

324
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.690
Two minutes.

325
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:36.970
What's up with you?

326
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:38.850
Nothing.

327
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.170
I decided to quit acting.

328
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.090
I sell clothes next door.

329
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.530
You're one of the few actresses
I ever advised to keep going.


330
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.250
Why?

331
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.490
Because I landed
a lead part in a film so soon?


332
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.530
I was sixteen and a half.

333
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.410
I was very young.

334
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.650
Everyone looked after me.

335
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.370
They did my hair, dressed me.

336
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.690
I was the Queen of Sheba.

337
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.970
But I did nothing after that.

338
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.570
I turned everything down,

339
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.290
on the pretense
I was a great actress


340
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.290
who shouldn't lower herself.

341
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.250
But you have to make a living somehow.

342
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.610
I wasn't going to get up
every morning to go to work.


343
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.890
I wasn't going to be like anyone else.

344
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.370
I moved in with a guy,

345
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.690
then a girl,

346
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.970
then with someone else.

347
00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.650
I refused to see things

348
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.490
Then I really started sleeping around.

349
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.890
What do you mean?

350
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.530
What's the difference?

351
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.650
Are you thick or what?

352
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.050
maybe.

353
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.570
Explain.

354
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.690
You're 20. You're beautiful.

355
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.250
You're young.

356
00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.210
The world's at your feet.
You use your charms.


357
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.450
But it doesn't last.

358
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.770
You become less beautiful.

359
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.970
Your hold on people
starts to weaken


360
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.290
There's always someone
who makes you pay the price.


361
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.410
Not being rich,
you end back at your parents'


362
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.690
I gradually noticed
other actresses,


363
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.610
the way they were.

364
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.370
Almast all of them wacko.

365
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.450
Same with the guys.

366
00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.570
Everyone apparently sweet as sugar,

367
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.170
but with egos

368
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.130
as big as cathedrals.

369
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.770
And me...

370
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.250
I was getting to be like them.

371
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.010
Slowly.

372
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.810
Out of laziness.

373
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.290
Out of self deceit.

374
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.930
Why let yourself go like that?

375
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.210
I've refused to let myself go.

376
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.290
That's just it.

377
00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.130
You'd better run too.

378
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.050
And run fast.

379
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.850
I'm fond of you you know.

380
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.930
Now that I've done your test,
I can admit it...


381
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.090
I've done porn before

382
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.290
I didn't tell you
for fear of being stereotyped.


383
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.010
-No thanks.
-There's beer in the fridge.


384
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.490
Help yourself.

385
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.330
How did you get into porn?

386
00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.610
Simple. I was a student.

387
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.890
I first started posing nude.

388
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.970
Then I started dancing.
Also nude.


389
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.770
That led naturally to stripping,
and then one day...


390
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.810
So for you,
having an orgasm on camera


391
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.450
is easy to do.

392
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.090
Dont think that. 
We rarely come.

393
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.050
Officially, never.

394
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.650
And you?

395
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.290
What do you want to know exactly?

396
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.530
If it's ever ecstasy?

397
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.170
Last time, I did a scene with a guy
who disgusted me.


398
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.330
Well I ended up having an orgasm.
Because of that.


399
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.450
It's hard to admit.

400
00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.730
We're all a bit weird,
a bit sluttish too.


401
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.250
The bigger the tabbo,
the more we like it. Of course.


402
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:50.090
When they hear we do porn,
lots of women come to see us.


403
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.530
to ask us what we do exactly,

404
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.050
if we really come and how often.
And if we enjoy it.


405
00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.130
To go slumming to find out.

406
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.410
Even umong us chicks,
we lie and boast.


407
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.410
Nvelists and filmmakers should
look into that side of women more.


408
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.210
Despite appearances,
its almost virgin territory.


409
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.370
I'm trying to.
Starting with the truth.


410
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.330
What's the truth? You're naive.

411
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:20.050
I ask because you seem to be
a sex professional who's smart


412
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.050
and sincere.

413
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:21.810
Sincere!

414
00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.730
We actors are all whores
for the role we want.


415
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.570
Even wonder why girls
do these tests for you?


416
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.650
Are you aware of the role you play?

417
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.290
I play a role?

418
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.370
-You're not neutral.
-How so?


419
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.130
You're not a playboy.

420
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.530
Yoy're one of the few
who listens to us.


421
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.810
You're calm self cofident,

422
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.730
on the surface at least.

423
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.410
You have both charm
and childlike innocence.


424
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.690
-Do I?
-Don't be stupid.


425
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.570
With you, there's something extra.

426
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.370
You're a father figure.

427
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.330
Me?

428
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.890
Me, me? Who else is here?

429
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.730
Even in the erotic area?

430
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.930
We feel like we're committing
a major transgression.


431
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.930
That makes the orgasm stronger

432
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.850
and different.

433
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.370
Just now, I was on my belly
dreaming that I ecited you,


434
00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.970
picturing you behind me,
doing like me


435
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.410
then taking me like an animal.

436
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.570
That made me come hard.

437
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.930
The occasions are rare.

438
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.610
Enough fine talk.
Was I god?


439
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.810
This seems to come easily to you.

440
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.770
I'll wait to see my video screen.

441
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.210
I'm too used to sex,

442
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.930
not uneasy enough?

443
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.690
Wait for my answer in a few days.

444
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.290
I'll be back for the readings.

445
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.690
Please have a seat

446
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.810
I have photos for you .
And my resume, too.


447
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.170
Look closely at this girl,
let her take you. Give in to her,


448
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:15.690
totally

449
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.330
I'm right here,

450
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:22.930
by your side.

451
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.130
Go for it.

452
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.930
Are you free for dinner?

453
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.690
My friend Agnes,
the girl with the books,


454
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.330
told me all about your film.

455
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.090
So there.

456
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.370
Now you and I will play a game.

457
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.570
What kind?

458
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.810
Enjoying my secret littel pleasures...

459
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.330
In a place ill-suited for them.

460
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.810
Where's that?

461
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.450
Here.

462
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.690
Where you're a regular.

463
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.250
How do you know that?

464
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.930
I invited someone you know?

465
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.490
Who?

466
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.970
-Afraid of being alone with me?
_Another acctress.


467
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.530
She'll be here soon.

468
00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.090
A rival?

469
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.570
Your potential partner.

470
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.130
Then she can join me.

471
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.450
I scare you?

472
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.850
I don't know. I'm waiting.

473
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.050
I move closer to the table.

474
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.330
I  place my hand on my leg,

475
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.770
just above the knee

476
00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.650
ond slowly move it up
the inside of my thigh.


477
00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.050
yes, look around discreetly.

478
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.850
Protect me.

479
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.530
Know what I'm doing?

480
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:11.730
I think so.

481
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.610
The waitresss is watching you.

482
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.490
So?

483
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.450
I just rub my finger
against my dress fabric.


484
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.450
Under the table.

485
00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.770
Does it feel good
even through the fabric?


486
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.650
Don't let it end now.

487
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.170
Want me to wait for your guest?

488
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.690
It's weird.

489
00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.490
It feels good to wait
for an orgasm like this.


490
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:05.330
I could make it last for hours.

491
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.650
Even If I'm a little nervous.

492
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.650
The waitress is looking again.

493
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.410
Open your dress.

494
00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.690
Move your fingers over the fabric.

495
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:34.930
Now, underneath.

496
00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.810
Feel good?

497
00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:42.010
very.

498
00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.970
Keep caressing yourself.

499
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.450
Even when she's closer,
but dicreetly.


500
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.690
So I can watch her reaction
when she realizes.


501
00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.210
A bottle of champagne, please?

502
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:19.450
You're cute.

503
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.210
I'm all wet.

504
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.570
Keep it up.

505
00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.530
So you're an actress?

506
00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.170
We're going to work together?

507
00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.170
Julie's passed the tests.

508
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.130
I'm doing the same thing
under the table.


509
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.650
I don't believe it.

510
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.370
Great!

511
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.170
Take off your panties.

512
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.610
But be careful.

513
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.410
Leave your hands exactly
where they are.


514
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:02.050
A menu?

515
00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.290
I'll just have champagne.

516
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.170
Move closer together.

517
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.170
and caress each other, but harder.

518
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.770
This is a terrific moment.

519
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.370
Thank you miss.

520
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.490
Aren't you frustrated

521
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:27.010
to be so close but bound
by a promise not to touch us?


522
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.690
Don't mind my frustration.

523
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.090
Don't let it end so fast.
It will be better later.


524
00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.570
I can take you
to the hotel next door.


525
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.250
Let's go.

526
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:03.930
Do you hear the electrical schools
sing and blaze? I repeat


527
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.810
Do you hear the electrical schools
sing and blaze?


528
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.650
You were both really superb.

529
00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.210
Come on.

530
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.570
-Like this?
-Yes


531
00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.170
Stand here, Julie.

532
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.570
Make her come a second time.

533
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.970
I'll stand guard.

534
00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:29.410
That was great.

535
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:32.890
We work and come at the same time.

536
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:36.130
Life should always be like this.

537
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.170
I never felt pleasure like this.

538
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.810
Me neither.

539
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.130
I was nearly in Seventh Heaven.

540
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:46.290
But you've had orgasms before?

541
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:47.890
Sometimes.

542
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.610
Only sometimes?

543
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.610
I'm trying to understand this.

544
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.450
You just experienced
something very powerful...


545
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.650
-So What's different?
-I don't know.


546
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.810
Lot;s of women never feel anything.

547
00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.170
Even alone,
including when they were very young.


548
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.010
Or so they say.

549
00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.410
I think they repress it.

550
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.450
When I'm alone, I do.

551
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:17.410
I often caress myself.

552
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.850
Sometimes as often as

553
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.210
I get so exhausted
my day is over with.


554
00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.210
I don't feel much with men.

555
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.770
Letting myself go with women is easier.

556
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.050
They know my body.

557
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.050
They know what to do.

558
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:37.530
And still having taboos in my head
adds to it.


559
00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:41.090
What about you Julie?
Apart from the ball?


560
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.850
I don't feel anything,

561
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.450
just the pleasure of exciting you and her.

562
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:51.410
I just lied and you didn't realize it.
That's women for you.


563
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.770
Just kidding.

564
00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.450
I've had orgasms
in lots of ways for years.


565
00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:01.330
When it starts, caresses and penetration
don't give the same pleasure.


566
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.970
It gradually spreads
throughout my entire body


567
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.770
and I come.

568
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.690
Sometimes it feels mystical.

569
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.850
With sodomy, it's something else.

570
00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.250
You're into sodomy?

571
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:17.610
Sometimes.

572
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.330
You have to take precautions

573
00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.450
and then, in no time,
you forget everything.


574
00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.930
The pleasure is fantastic.

575
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.730
But to have an orgasm,
you also rub yourself?


576
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.570
I don't have an orgasm.

577
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.330
Just immense pleasure.

578
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.250
Like when I suck off a handsome guy.

579
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.490
I have to run
or my boyfriend will kill me.


580
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.010
Not coming down?

581
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.930
-I want to stay a bit.
-Me, too.


582
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.930
You want to be together
without me?


583
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.890
What she said was interesting.

584
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.330
Take an interest in me.

585
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.730
Know where I'd just been
when I met you?


586
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.570
At my shrink's.

587
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:15.970
I see him twice a week.

588
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:18.290
I used to, anyway.

589
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:23.170
When I met you I decided
to end my therapy


590
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.770
and never see my shrink again.

591
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.850
That's both flattering and worrying.

592
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.530
Maybe more worrying than flattering.

593
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.010
Why do you say that?

594
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.650
My father's a great Psychiatrist
who studied psychoanalysis.


595
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.730
My mother is a psychoanalyst.

596
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.250
Everybody's a shrink in my family.

597
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:49.530
Your boyfriend too?

598
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:51.250
Hardly.

599
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.090
We just broke up.

600
00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.130
The night of the day I met you.

601
00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:59.450
Because of me?

602
00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.330
I don't know.

603
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:03.410
I don't think so.

604
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.690
Dad bought me a flat.

605
00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:10.530
He gives me an allowance.

606
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.250
He's famous.

607
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.890
He owns several clinics
and gives lectures.


608
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:18.530
-Your parents live together?
-No.


609
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:21.210
He gave my mother a child. Me.

610
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:23.530
Other women, too.

611
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:27.450
He legally recognized me.
He sees me regularly.


612
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.690
Even if, when I was a kid,

613
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.690
going to see him
was quite a ritual.


614
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:37.290
My existance
was kept secret from his wife


615
00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:41.330
who threatened suicide
whenever a skirt walked by him.


616
00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:44.330
Once, when I was seven,

617
00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:46.690
I went to see him at his clinic.

618
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:48.210
She was there.

619
00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:51.090
My mother introduced me
as a casual visitor.


620
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:54.330
And his wife threw herself in
a lake 15 minutes later.


621
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:58.530
My mom and I found a boat
and jumped in to fish her out.


622
00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.450
I used an oar.

623
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.010
Luckily it wasn't too deep.

624
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.530
My mom had a boyfriend

625
00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:10.650
When she was with a patient,

626
00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:14.930
the boyfriend flirted with me
and kissed me all over.


627
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.650
Did that go on long?

628
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.890
Three or four years, on and off.

629
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.330
Did you tell your mother?

630
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.610
When I realized what we were doing.

631
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:31.690
She didn't believe me,
and ended up marrying him.


632
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.570
I ran away to see my father.

633
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:36.610
He rented me a place.

634
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:39.730
That's how I ended up
on my own at 13.


635
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.810
I've led a rough life until now.

636
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.850
-How old are you?
-21


637
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.450
I'll tell you the rest later.

638
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.570
I'm very fond of you.

639
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:58.290
You're going fast.

640
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.930
My affection comes fast
or not at all.


641
00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.890
And it can last.

642
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:16.530
True, at 21 you must have already had
many enduring romances.


643
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.010
It's Julie.

644
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.690
-I came back. I'm coming up.
-Okay.


645
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.410
It's Julie.

646
00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:51.610
I had a fight with my boyfriend.

647
00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:53.250
You told him about this?

648
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.570
Tonight was work.
It's not his business.


649
00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.890
But I didn't make him dinner.

650
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.450
he yelled and left.

651
00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.130
Let's go out
and bop till we drop.


652
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:03.690
Great.

653
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.250
Mind if we try a sex club?
I feel like experimenting.


654
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.330
Sure.

655
00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.250
-Without me kids.
-Oh come on!


656
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.890
You really won't come with us?

657
00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.170
See the time?

658
00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:00.930
You could have called.

659
00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.810
So? How are you coming?

660
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.650
What is it?
You jealous of his wife?


661
00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.770
Mind your own business.

662
00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.970
Find your actresses?

663
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:37.650
I need a third one.

664
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.170
What do you ask of them?

665
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:46.570
If they agree to take me into
their taboo erotic fantasies.


666
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.050
And I watch them.

667
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:53.330
Without touching them?

668
00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:55.250
No, why?

669
00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.490
What did you do with them tonight?

670
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.890
Tests.

671
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:04.130
Erotic ones?

672
00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:08.610
After which you fucked me like you
haven't done in ages.


673
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:13.250
Look me in the eye.

674
00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.210
What are you after?

675
00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.210
Understanding what goes on
in their head.


676
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:21.610
Watching them in their pleasure
even when they fake it.


677
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:27.570
Then i write a script that stylizes
what they tell me for the screen.


678
00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.450
Always alone with them?

679
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.010
Who can I use as a witness? You?

680
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:35.810
An assistant?
Nothing will happen.


681
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.050
You'd be called a manipulator

682
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.650
and accused because you're a man.

683
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.010
I wont turn into a woman.

684
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.010
Listen to me.

685
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:48.490
These girls are prepared to say
what you want to hear,


686
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:52.050
and betray you if you
don't cast them.


687
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.450
Even if they are good, find others.

688
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.890
They may suddenly back out,
on a whim


689
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.730
or out of emotional blackmail,

690
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:03.210
or because of a jealous guy.

691
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.170
Protect yourself, my friend.

692
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.890
I sense you're in danger.

693
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.330
And so am I.

694
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.370
Don't be silly.

695
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.210
Come here.

696
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.130
Reminder

697
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:58.410
The little blue demons have orders

698
00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.530
not to attack their loved ones
before the slaughter.


699
00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:03.490
I repeat:The little blue demons

700
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:07.970
are not to attack their loved ones
before the slaughter. 3 times.


701
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.730
Help me please.
Come get me.


702
00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:13.170
I'm alone.

703
00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.490
all alone since last night. Come!

704
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:18.530
Listen, a girl's lying
on a bench in my bar


705
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:20.890
She came in an hour ago, crocked.

706
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:22.650
Come get her, now.

707
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:27.450
Are you Francois?

708
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:28.890
This way.

709
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:38.330
Charlotte.

710
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:40.010
Are you her father?

711
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:42.050
Nor her father, husband, or lover.

712
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:45.530
Lucky you. I'm sick of her coming
and making a scene.


713
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.050
Getout. If i see her again,
I'll throw her out.


714
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:06.770
No Charlotte

715
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:08.130
Make love to me.

716
00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:09.970
Come on.

717
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:11.610
I want you.

718
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.010
-You're drunk.
-Fuck me.


719
00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:14.610
We'll both regret it.

720
00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:16.410
Get into bed.

721
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:24.850
I'm taking a shower.

722
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:05.810
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.


723
00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:07.970
Lie down

724
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:19.690
Feel better?

725
00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:25.090
What happened?

726
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:26.610
Who'd you fight with?

727
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:28.490
No one.

728
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:30.850
It takes a hefty man to do that.

729
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.690
Was it your ex-boyfriend?

730
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.170
No, I did it myself.

731
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.490
Don't you want to tell me?

732
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.210
Is it so hard?

733
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:43.290
You wouldn't believe me.

734
00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:45.850
You'd lie to me?

735
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:49.930
Cross my heart and hope to die.

736
00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:56.210
It's like this:

737
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.370
The devil posseses me sometimes.

738
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:08.930
-Isn't drugs, rather?
-I dont take drugs. Any.


739
00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:10.970
I never have.

740
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:13.730
I swear

741
00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:16.130
Since i was making a racket

742
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.650
the concierge's son,

743
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.370
who's a childhood friend,

744
00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:24.530
came up.

745
00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:26.770
He has the keys.

746
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:28.850
He came in

747
00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:31.810
and tried to pin me down.

748
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.530
But I was stronger than him.

749
00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:39.370
He called his friend
and both tried


750
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.090
At firts I was stronger than them.

751
00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:48.450
But then the devil abandoned me

752
00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:51.290
and I lost my might.

753
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:53.410
Please.

754
00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:56.490
never tell anyone.

755
00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:58.850
I won't.

756
01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:06.250
I haven't told you anywhere near
my whole life story.


757
01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:10.210
Sometimes, I'm on the verge of despair.

758
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:20.850
Why won't you go back to your shrink?

759
01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.090
Sit down Stephanie.

760
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.330
Have we met?

761
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.970
Strange, I'm sure I've already
seen you somewhere before.


762
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.370
Excuse me.

763
01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.570
It's Charlotte. 
I'm I bothering you?

764
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.370
I'm in a meeting.

765
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:49.850
Julie is with me.

766
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:53.690
We went out ahain last night.
We've already done three clubs.


767
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:57.010
We're in a truck with some guys
who're playing music.


768
01:00:57.810 --> 01:00:59.010
Why not join us?

769
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.010
-You haven't slept?
-What for?


770
01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:03.370
We'll do it again tonight.

771
01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:05.530
How do you keep going? On Coke?

772
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.650
We stop at champagne.

773
01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:11.130
-You're spending a fortune.
-The guys are paying.


774
01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:13.930
-For nothing in return?
-We're big girls.


775
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:18.050
It's Julie. Come on.
We'll turn you on to some cool stuff.


776
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:20.010
I'm in a meeting.

777
01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:21.810
With a pretty girl?

778
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.570
As lovely and exciting as us?

779
01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:27.210
You'd better go home to bed.
Goodbye.


780
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:29.650
Sorry about that.

781
01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:33.250
I heard about your work for a movie.

782
01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:36.930
You did say you want to leave

783
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.370
room for erotic improvisation.

784
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:41.290
To avoid filming
my own fantasies.


785
01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:45.730
I'd like a man, even several men
to take me to a hotel


786
01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.690
An afternoon delight.

787
01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:53.690
I see myself making love
to three men. Maybe even five.


788
01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:58.450
I understand three.
Why the other two?


789
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:01.010
I still have two hands.

790
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.770
Did I shock you?

791
01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:05.690
Hardly.

792
01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.490
Six in a bedroom.

793
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.330
Me in the middle.

794
01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.130
If possible, blindfolded.

795
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:13.530
So when I pass a man later,

796
01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:17.570
I can imagine it might be him
I had sex with.


797
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:23.210
Allow me to live out my dreams.

798
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:27.810
Take me to hotel room yourself.
A hot-sheet hotel.


799
01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:29.850
I'll do the tests with you.

800
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:32.490
You'd do me a favor.

801
01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:35.890
Well?

802
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:40.090
Well what?

803
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.130
Will you take me to a hotel?

804
01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.930
Take your camera and let's go.

805
01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:49.810
I'm starting to want you.

806
01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:51.490
Me?

807
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:55.890
I scare you.
I can see it in your eyes.


808
01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:59.810
You ask girls to put out
but you won't do likewise.


809
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:04.290
True, you make me uncomfortable.

810
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.970
You really need to be shaken up.

811
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:20.850
Let's go.

812
01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:41.530
It's us again.
We're never tired of partying.


813
01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:45.450
And Stephanie persuaded
the two girls to join us.


814
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:06.930
THe ghost stars must now flood
the green desert seas


815
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:08.010
Two times.

816
01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:14.650
Some fun at last.

817
01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:17.410
It's time to cast their red shrouds

818
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:20.770
over the great hollow mountains.
Two times again.


819
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:41.290
You must be used to seeing
girls masturbate.


820
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.450
I'm starting to be.

821
01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:15.490
I'd never done it untill now.

822
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:20.650
Know why I'm doing it today?

823
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.770
I love to msturbate for you.
I love you watching me.


824
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.450
Film me.

825
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:38.770
The other girls.

826
01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:42.690
They can come back in an hour.

827
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:44.810
Let them in.

828
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:47.490
You sure?

829
01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:50.010
Don't say anything.

830
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:53.850
Let them in.
THey'll be in for a surprise.


831
01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:03.250
Don't I'll take care of them.

832
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.650
Sit down a second.

833
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.130
Like this?

834
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:17.010
What I just experienced
is terrofic and new.


835
01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:22.850
Film or no film,
we'll do it again.


836
01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:28.850
Actually, you've seen me before.

837
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:32.690
The waitress. I'm a friend of Charlotte's.

838
01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:37.050
Charlotte's mother thinks
I'm a pathological liar.


839
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:39.810
She may be right.

840
01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:42.330
You in analysis too?

841
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.810
That's how I met Charlotte.

842
01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:49.690
Did you think I was beautiful?

843
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:53.130
You were all terrific.

844
01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:55.050
So will you cast us?

845
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:59.810
I'll be going.

846
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:30.890
I've almost reached my goal.
I hope so anyway.


847
01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:49.730
Final act.

848
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:52.290
You're on.

849
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:08.130
One of your chicks again?

850
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.650
Don't. Keep our life apart.

851
01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:12.890
At this hour it might be serious.

852
01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:17.970
It's Stephanie.

853
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:21.610
It's important.
I'm in love with Charlotte.


854
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.850
I love her. I had to tell you.

855
01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.210
Can I see you tomorrow?

856
01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:32.970
Come by the office in the morning.
Early if possible.


857
01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:33.970
Take care.

858
01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:36.050
It was one of your babes.

859
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.770
I can tell from your dumb look.

860
01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:41.850
You're too nice to them.

861
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:44.370
How can i not be,
with all I ask of them?


862
01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:46.250
You ask them to act.

863
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:48.490
No more than laughing
and crying sincerely.


864
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:52.210
Fr some people, acting out sex
is different from the rest


865
01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:53.690
Sex is immoral, understand?

866
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:58.210
The girls I have

867
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:00.370
went all the way.

868
01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:03.170
They're crazy
and have you under a spell.


869
01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:05.850
You're asking for trouble.

870
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:09.250
Must you really have them
do all that for you?

871
01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:11.770
I can only film what I know.

872
01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:16.210
And drama schools won't teach you

873
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:20.690
to rub off under a teblecloth
or make beautiful love to someone.


874
01:13:21.490 --> 01:13:25.530
My project has grown:
I want to convey mystical ecstasy


875
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.490
as the actresses mount towards orgasm.

876
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.530
You only feel that in love,

877
01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:32.210
in real love.

878
01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:34.570
Even there, it's rare.

879
01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:38.130
I was lucky to feel it twice

880
01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:39.730
with you.

881
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:42.530
Let's seek it together,
just you and me.


882
01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:46.650
I can't be actor and observer.

883
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:51.250
You're not the same with me anymore.

884
01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:56.090
I love you. I
feel that I've lost you.

885
01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:02.410
I need you deeply.

886
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:04.530
It's not the same thing.

887
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:06.810
Listen closely:

888
01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:11.250
You're headed for a brick wall
and you don't realize it.


889
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:13.970
With me as well.

890
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:25.210
Please don't answer.

891
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:27.690
Don't get melodramatic.
It's just a message.


892
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:29.930
For me.

893
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:34.170
YOu have one new message,
received at 3.00 a.m.


894
01:14:35.730 --> 01:14:40.850
It's Charlotte. Stephanie declared
she is mad about me.


895
01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:44.610
You know, I like men.
I'll do what you want,


896
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:48.010
make love to her for real,
but for you.


897
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:49.690
Only for you.

898
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:51.530
For your film.

899
01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:04.290
Why are you always so sad?

900
01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:10.170
"The stars studded the deep dark sky"

901
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.370
"amid the night flowers a slim cresent
shone in the west,


902
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.770
"and Ruth Wondered Immobile,

903
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:18.530
"eye half open beneath her veils

904
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:20.130
"which god

905
01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:23.850
"who reaped this tmeless summer
had so idly dropped in departing


906
01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.970
"this golden sickle
in the field of stars."


907
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.010
-Hugo.
Nicely read.


908
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:32.530
Learn it all by heart now.

909
01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:39.170
Come lie next to me.

910
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:45.370
Later, I'll tell journalists
I became a lesbian thanks to you.


911
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:48.410
That's not how I love you.

912
01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:51.290
I loved sharing pleasure,
but that's all.


913
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:56.930
Don't leave me alone.

914
01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.170
It's Francois.
Excuse me.


915
01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:07.210
So you feel lonely with me?

916
01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:10.250
I take what I get

917
01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:14.930
But remember, if you need a favour
or jelp count on me.


918
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:17.290
I won't ask for anything in return.

919
01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:41.810
I'm intruding.

920
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:43.530
Not at all.

921
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:46.370
Come here.

922
01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:51.890
I'm only staying a moment.

923
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:55.730
I came to see Stephanie
and her new friend.


924
01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.090
Stephanie is like a sister.

925
01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:00.530
I love her.
I never refuse her anything.


926
01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:07.170
She and I come from poor families.

927
01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:10.130
But sometimes, thanks to my contacts,

928
01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:13.330
I burn a rich guy,
a VIP or someone famous.


929
01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.530
Why are you telling me this?

930
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:17.930
You threatening me?

931
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.250
Not at all.

932
01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:21.730
Don't take it that way.
We're just talking.


933
01:17:22.690 --> 01:17:24.290
See you, sister darling.

934
01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.890
Have a good time.

935
01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:43.530
Is he a guy you sleep with?

936
01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:47.090
What's wrong with that?
It's Charlotte I love.


937
01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:49.330
It's your life after all.

938
01:17:50.130 --> 01:17:52.170
But keep him away from me.

939
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:35.450
I see you're still doing tests?
You betraying us?


940
01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:38.170
How did you know I was here?
From the office?


941
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:39.410
No, we followed you.

942
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.930
You taking the new girl?

943
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.930
Why should I answer.
I should kick you off the film.


944
01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:50.530
We feel cheated.

945
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.250
You girls are something.

946
01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:53.930
What if you get sick

947
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.810
or change your mind
at the last minute?


948
01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:59.210
Your lame excuses
won't keep us off the film.


949
01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:01.770
-I'll jump out of a window
-I will too


950
01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:03.930
I'll beat you to a pulp.

951
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:06.370
You haven't done a thing for me.

952
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:09.650
You did some admittedly
unusual screen tests.


953
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:11.930
Others did and didn't get cast.

954
01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:14.130
-It's happening in all films.
-It's not the same.


955
01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:16.690
WE gave up everything for you.

956
01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.290
Unfortunately.

957
01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:21.330
Threats to boot.
I should fire you instantly.


958
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:25.770
-I can only be an actress.
-Millions of girls aren't


959
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.930
-Then I'll kill myself.
-So will.


960
01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:30.290
So you said!
I don't recommend acting.


961
01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:32.010
To anybody.

962
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.650
Mind your dad's clinic.
That would be useful.


963
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:36.650
Never!

964
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:40.730
Please don't abandon me.
I need you now.


965
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:43.250
After the film, I can keep
doing tests for you.


966
01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:45.490
I'm so attached to you.

967
01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:46.890
I think I'm in...

968
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.570
You girls wear me out.
I'm out of here.


969
01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:58.090
Frame them like this.
To play up light and shadow contrast.


970
01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:00.050
We'll try out
three different light later.


971
01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:03.970
Ladies, this is the producer.

972
01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:05.570
Thanks Francois.

973
01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:06.650
Nice to meet you.

974
01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:09.010
You're lovely.

975
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:10.930
Where is Charlotte?

976
01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:12.850
-In makeup.
-Be right back.


977
01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:22.890
You okay?

978
01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:25.890
Look at me.

979
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:27.730
better warm her up a bit.

980
01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.050
see you in a minute.

981
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:34.850
I want a very
close shot on the kid

982
01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:37.050
and backlight her.

983
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:55.770
Get a doctor quick.

984
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:57.850
-It's not a doctor she needs.
-Go on!


985
01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:00.850
Give me a hand.

986
01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:07.130
Stop.

987
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:29.930
I'm the Devil's Beloved!

988
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:33.970
let go of me!

989
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:37.170
Let go of me!

990
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.730
Found someone to replace her?

991
01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:50.570
Not yet.

992
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:53.090
Do we have to let her go?

993
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.610
She's always been normal with me.

994
01:21:56.890 --> 01:22:00.890
I won't sign a contract with this girl.

995
01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:03.250
Find a replacement and quick.

996
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:05.050
Not one. Two!

997
01:22:07.930 --> 01:22:10.370
You're all disgusting to treat her
this way.


998
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:14.290
You used her.

999
01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.650
And me. And all the others.

1000
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:18.890
Your film is only possible

1001
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:20.850
thanks to us.

1002
01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:22.810
Thanks to our tests,

1003
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:25.010
when we fucked for you.

1004
01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:28.730
If you dump Charlotte now,

1005
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:32.050
I swear I'll stop your film.

1006
01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:34.050
I'll get back at you.

1007
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:36.050
Who are these nuts?
Young lady,


1008
01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:38.490
I make the decisions here.

1009
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:40.730
You're fired. Both of you.

1010
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:44.290
And you don't say
a word in our favour.

1011
01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:50.010
Get these crazies out of here!

1012
01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:07.330
Forgive me.

1013
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:11.650
I say nothing more.

1014
01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:15.290
I am losing my memory

1015
01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:20.770
of good and eveil.

1016
01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:25.850
I am a cradle

1017
01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:28.650
rocked by a hand

1018
01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:31.930
in the hollow of a tomb.

1019
01:23:33.570 --> 01:23:35.090
Silence.

1020
01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:37.890
Silence.

1021
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:43.250
Forgive me my beloved,

1022
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:48.250
but my pain is great.

1023
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:53.890
And I'm so afraid.

1024
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:57.650
So afraid.

1025
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:03.650
Help me, daddy dearest.

1026
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.050
Oh, help!

1027
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.050
I'm begging you.

1028
01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.570
I'm here, my little girl.

1029
01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:19.850
I'm here.

1030
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:22.210
Forget about these bastards.
have no fear.


1031
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:24.370
They'll pay dearly for this.

1032
01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:31.570
This is all your fault.

1033
01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:38.690
Did she have to rub it in?

1034
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:45.570
But I was still in charge
of a film and a crew.


1035
01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:51.210
Luckily I soon found
two replacements.


1036
01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:54.170
One of them, Celine,
despite my qualms,


1037
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:57.250
proved to be a fine actress
and a very sweet girl.


1038
01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:09.410
Contrary to my fears,

1039
01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:12.530
shooting went without a hitch.

1040
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:17.610
Later I tried to contact
the two other girls,


1041
01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:20.650
but they had moved away
and changed phone numbers.


1042
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:25.330
And, mysteriously,

1043
01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:29.050
Julie had vanished after
her last day on the film.


1044
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:33.410
The film was an unxpected success.

1045
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:36.970
But I still hadn't found
answers to my questions.


1046
01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:40.890
Why does sex lead
to such violence and hypocricy


1047
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:44.250
over matters that are no more
than a tempest in a teapot?


1048
01:25:46.210 --> 01:25:47.290
And then,

1049
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:49.330
as Celine said to me,
What is truth?


1050
01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:52.410
In fact I was probably
chasing the wind.


1051
01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:59.170
Police goodmorning.

1052
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:01.650
Sergeant Devigny.
I have a warrant.


1053
01:26:02.610 --> 01:26:06.930
I was taken in custody
and questioned on charges of harassing


1054
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:09.370
Charotte and Stephanie.

1055
01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:13.050
I had a prison sentence
hanging over my head.


1056
01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:15.890
The word immediately got out
in the proffesion,


1057
01:26:16.770 --> 01:26:19.090
and picked up by the gutter press.

1058
01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:21.690
It earned me a sickening notoriety

1059
01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:26.170
which my intuition had neither
sought or imagined


1060
01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:28.890
when it drove me to this film.

1061
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:34.010
the absurdity of it all.

1062
01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:54.730
Francois,

1063
01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:57.570
sadly, I heard about
what you've been doing all these months.


1064
01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:02.450
I'll never forgive you
for having betrayed me so badly.


1065
01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:06.850
I left before it was too late.
Don't forget,


1066
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:10.130
time goes fast, for everyone.

1067
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.530
I'm so glad to see you again.

1068
01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:47.290
So am I.

1069
01:28:50.050 --> 01:28:51.250
A kiss?

1070
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:05.490
Why did you vanish after the flm?

1071
01:29:08.770 --> 01:29:09.490
Well?

1072
01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:12.650
I met someone.

1073
01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:15.970
I had to tell him about the film.
He was jealous.


1074
01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:18.890
When my scenes were done,

1075
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:22.890
he forced me to move,
change my phone number,


1076
01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:24.330
burn all my bridges.

1077
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:26.930
What do you do now?

1078
01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:28.810
I work in computers.

1079
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:31.170
Are you happy?

1080
01:29:34.690 --> 01:29:36.770
The truth is I ran away.

1081
01:29:37.450 --> 01:29:38.370
From what?

1082
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:41.370
You.

1083
01:29:42.370 --> 01:29:43.170
Me?

1084
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:47.250
When I touched myself
in front of you at the beggining,


1085
01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:51.490
I hardly enjoyed it.

1086
01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:55.210
But then I felt an intense pleasure,

1087
01:29:56.050 --> 01:29:58.730
which was even stronger
when I made love with Charlotte.


1088
01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:03.410
It's because you were watching me.
You initiated me


1089
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:05.970
and now I miss all that.

1090
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:08.530
And to be honest,

1091
01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:12.850
at the time, I grew attached to you.

1092
01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:15.730
Very strongly even.

1093
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.410
As strong as that?

1094
01:30:19.810 --> 01:30:21.610
You didn't realize it, did you?

1095
01:30:25.570 --> 01:30:27.730
You never realized anything.

1096
01:30:28.730 --> 01:30:30.730
I mean, anything serious.

1097
01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:34.570
For instance that you were being
manipulated by all those girls.


1098
01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:38.490
And that you set something off in me.

1099
01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:43.450
See what I'm getting at?

1100
01:30:45.370 --> 01:30:47.690
You realize how you hurt me?

1101
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:49.850
I hurt you?

1102
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:53.530
That's what I'm trying to say.

1103
01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:54.770
Sorry.

1104
01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:59.210
I didn't know.
The shoot was hell for me too.


1105
01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:02.490
The shoot...

1106
01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:04.890
Still don't understand?

1107
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:09.330
What should I understand?

1108
01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:13.050
Tell me.

1109
01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:16.610
I can't even hate you.

1110
01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:21.050
You never realized
I was in love with you?


1111
01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:24.290
Not only for the sex.

1112
01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:26.690
It was powerful, deep.

1113
01:31:28.130 --> 01:31:31.250
So I chose to run to another man
and never see you again.


1114
01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:35.330
You fell in love with me?

1115
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:39.130
My god...

1116
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:44.850
yet I'm sure you don't even
do it on purpose.


1117
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:48.770
It was that powerful?

1118
01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.010
probably for the others too.

1119
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:55.370
You set off such intence, deep things.

1120
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:59.490
That's why it all anded badly.

1121
01:32:01.290 --> 01:32:03.250
You'll never stop being...

1122
01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:06.370
so clueless.

1123
01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:09.930
But, even for just that,

1124
01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.930
I'll keep aplace
for you in my heart.


1125
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:16.130
I have to go now.

1126
01:32:17.610 --> 01:32:18.810
Give me your number?

1127
01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:22.650
I'll give you mine?

1128
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:26.930
We'll meet again.

1129
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:43.170
Their great blue desert is just
a chained hell without flames.


1130
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.370
Three times. I repeat.

1131
01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:48.970
Their great blue desert is just
a chained hell without flames.


1132
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:16.810
What do you want?

1133
01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:26.450
Let go of me!

1134
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:40.890
We finish him off.

1135
01:35:10.450 --> 01:35:11.650
Why did you save him?

1136
01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:14.410
Oh, my God!

1137
01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:19.090
I'm here, my child.

1138
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:21.610
I'm your neighbor. Don't worry.

1139
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:25.170
What got into you?
Why did you do that?


1140
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:27.730
Are you in love with him?

1141
01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:30.290
What if I am?

1142
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:34.290
You are both in that void
where the dead seek each other.


1143
01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:39.610
They never should have put me with you.
We're both lost.
