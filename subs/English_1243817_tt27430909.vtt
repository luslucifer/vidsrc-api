-Hey, what about
these germaphobes?


2
00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:04.875
They can't shake your hand.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.417
They got to give you
the fist bump.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:07.833
You know what I do?
I grabbed their fist,


5
00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.083
I hold it my armpit
for a count of six.

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:10.125
Come on.
[ Laughter ]

Dolby, come on.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.500
The whole show's
gonna be like this.

The whole show.

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.667
Other comics use gimmicks
like ability, timing,

good material, talent, whatever.

12
00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.250
None of that stuff in my show.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.375
The whole thing -- pure panic.

14
00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.500
Come on. My whole act
is a side effect of Moderna.

If I took medication,
I would take Prozac,

Don't leave me hanging.

know, couples, married people.

if it takes confidence

but I just wanted

to talk about this.

[ Laughter ]

94
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.375
It does take confidence
to do this.

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:37.500
It takes a -- not a general
confidence, but a specific kind.


96
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.125
You know? There's lots
of kinds of confidence.


97

There's personal confidence.

98

I don't have much of that.
That's...


99
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.042
Personal confidence is like
a man wearing white pants.


100
00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:49.667
That takes, you know...

tremendous confidence

[ Laughter ]

108
00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:10.500
I could never wear
white pants


109
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.250
because I'll get my period,
first of all. I know that.

[ Laughter ]

113
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.542
Which is -- That's really
my period. Diarrhea.


114
00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:28.375
About once a month, I'm like,
"Oh, fuck, here we go."

[ Laughter ]

It's true.
Don't make --


120
00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:44.583
You know, if you have diarrhea,
don't, like, negotiate.


121
00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:47.917
It's a bad
bargaining position.


122
00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:50.250
If I have diarrhea, you stand
between me and the toilet,


123
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.333
I'll sell you my house
for 10 cents.

[ Laughter ]

125
00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:01.750
So that's one kind
of confidence.


126
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.458
Here's another kind --
moral confidence.


127
00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:06.375
Moral confidence. That means
knowing that you would


128
00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.792
do the right thing,

129
00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:09.750
knowing that
you wouldn't do something wrong.


130
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.000
Moral confidence.

131
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.417
You can have that
in your daily life


132
00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.042
because a lot of your days
are the same.


133
00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:16.417
But what if you were
in another time?


134
00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:18.042
Like, I would love to believe,

135
00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:22.500
I feel confident that
I would not have had slaves.


136
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.833
I wouldn't have done it.
I wouldn't have done it.


137
00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:29.667
I wouldn't have had any.

138
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:34.583
Even if I lived in 17-whatever
in Virginia


139
00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:36.167
and all my neighbors had slaves,

140
00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:38.250
I would have been like,
"You guys are dicks."


141
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.917
[ Laughter ]

142
00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:44.083
I can say that.

143
00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:47.792
But it's easy to say that now
because you can't get no slaves.


144
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:52.083
You just can't --
You can't get any.


145
00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:53.792
That's why
you don't have slaves.


146
00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:57.500
It's not because you're better
than back-then people.


147
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.167
It's because
they're not available.


148
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:03.458
That's a huge
contributing factor.


149
00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:05.208
It's not a decision you need

150
00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:07.750
to make every day, like
you're carrying your groceries.


151
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.708
"Ah, fuck. Maybe I should --
No, no, I better not.


152
00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:11.917
But, geez, it would be easier."

153
00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:14.500
[ Laughter ]
Because they're not there.


154
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.208
It's not like they have slaves
at Home Depot.


155
00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:19.750
I mean, they kind of do,
but, yeah...


156
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.917
[ Laughter ]

157
00:06:20.917 --> 00:06:25.875
...there are some forms

158
00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:27.958
of kind of slavery.

159
00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.667
You can get a Russian woman

160
00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.667
to do whatever you want

But that's still temporary.

You could adopt, like,

...that slavery gets rebranded,

but it doesn't really
ever totally go away.


176
00:07:10.917 --> 00:07:15.000
I mean, it's been part of
human history going way back,

way back, slavery.

But the earliest images
of human life

already had the guys going,
"Uhh!"

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:34.917
How early did we come up
with this?


186
00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:37.500
Like, from the beginning
of human existence,


187
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.833
we evolved, you know,
through ideas.


188
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:44.083
We were a scared, naked ape,
and then we were like,


189
00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:47.542
"Make a fire.
That's a good idea.

That's a good idea."

194
00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.000
But really quickly
we came up with,


195
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.625
"Just make them fucking do it.
I'm not doing anything.

So, you can have confidence,

but you got
to be a little, you know.


202
00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.333
I mean, there's things that
people did in history that I


203
00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:24.208
wouldn't have done for sure.

204
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.333
Like, I wouldn't have made
an Auschwitz.


205
00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:28.375
I wouldn't have done that.

with an Auschwitz?

They killed children.

and moved to Brooklyn

who's a comedian in England,

about Auschwitz.

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:17.125
I go there every day.

318
00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:21.542
I buy a handful of scrunchies,
and I run home.


319
00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:23.250
Everything else, I buy online.

320
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.125
[ Laughter ]

321
00:13:27.292 --> 00:13:28.750
Anyway, when I walk
by this homeless guy


322
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.000
in the morning,
he always goes,


323
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.667
"Hey, man, can you help me out?"

324
00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.125
And I go, "Sure."

325
00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:38.125
I give him 5 bucks,
and I go to the store.


326
00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:40.125
Five minutes later,
I walk by, and he says,


327
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:42.083
"Hey, man. Can I --"

328
00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:44.667
He doesn't remember,
which is fine,


329
00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:49.833
but I don't want to give him
another 5 bucks, you know,


330
00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.708
because I only have
a few million.


331
00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:53.500
I don't know why.
I don't know why.


332
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.167
I clearly should.
[ Laughter ]


333
00:13:56.167 --> 00:14:00.250
I don't know what makes me go,
"Mm-hmm-hmm.


334
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.750
You had your $5, young man."

335
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.333
[ Laughter ]

336
00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:09.708
What? Am I gonna spoil him?

337
00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:11.667
[ Laughter ]

338
00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:19.500
You know what I was thinking
about today?


339
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.750
I was thinking about Jesus.

340
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.083
[ Laughter ]

341
00:14:24.083 --> 00:14:27.167
I was. Today.

342
00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:28.833
I was thinking about Jesus.

343
00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:31.125
And after I came...

344
00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:33.333
[ Laughter ]
...I...


345
00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:40.042
I thought,

346
00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:43.250
"Well, I feel sorry for Jesus."
That's how I feel.


347
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.625
I don't know how much
you know about Jesus,


348
00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.542
but I feel fucking bad
for Jesus, man.


349
00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:49.375
I do. He had a hard life.

350
00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:51.333
I mean, the last day was
particularly difficult, but...


351
00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:53.750
[ Laughter ]

352
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.042
If you look at pictures of him,

353
00:14:55.042 --> 00:14:56.625
he had to wear
that -- that thong,


354
00:14:56.625 --> 00:15:01.125
that fucking just dishrag
yanked up his balls.


355
00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:04.625
Just [Groans]

356
00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:06.750
carrying his cross like, "Fuck.

357
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.625
It's the rash."

358
00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.625
[ Laughter ]

359
00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:12.708
Some people say you should
live like Jesus.


360
00:15:12.708 --> 00:15:14.208
Who can live --
He was insane.


361
00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:16.417
[ Muttering ]

362
00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:19.500
You can't live like that.

363
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.125
He had a weird life.
I'm reading about Jesus.


364
00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:23.292
I have this book about Jesus.

365
00:15:23.292 --> 00:15:24.625
[ Laughter ]

366
00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.208
I'm gonna share it with you.

367
00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:28.458
[ Cheers and applause ]

368
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.708
Okay.

369
00:15:34.708 --> 00:15:38.083
This is a book about Jesus.

370
00:15:38.083 --> 00:15:41.792
Actually, only this much
is about Jesus.


371
00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:44.500
Only that -- just that part.

372
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.917
The rest of it is just the Jews
going like, "And then we


373
00:15:47.917 --> 00:15:51.917
walked for 50 years
in the desert.


374
00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:54.208
And we only had
a little bit of oil.


375
00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:56.750
It was difficult."
It's just...


376
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.833
It's fucking verbose.

377
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:01.958
Just Jews.

378
00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.000
It just goes on and on.

379
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.958
"And then Jacob
bought a goat, and...


380
00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.000
[ Laughter ]

381
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.125
And Abraham lived to be 800."

382
00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:17.875
Yeah, I bet
he fucking did, too.


383
00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:19.667
[ Laughter ]

384
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:27.125
The Jews in the early chapters
are all, like, 800 years old.


385
00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.583
And then God was like,

386
00:16:28.583 --> 00:16:32.958
"I can't with these fucking Jews
for 800 years.


387
00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.125
Heart disease starts today."

388
00:16:35.125 --> 00:16:37.083
[ Laughter ]

389
00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.083
So that's them.

390
00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:44.875
And that's Jesus.

391
00:16:44.875 --> 00:16:46.250
This little part's Jesus.

392
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.958
And the weird part
is, it's not all --


393
00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.875
Like, it's all the same story
over and over again.


394
00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.542
They tell the same story
about Jesus' life over.


395
00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:55.875
First Matthew tells it,
and then Mark is like,


396
00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:58.750
"Dude, that's not what --
You're fucking drunk.


397
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.250
Here's what happened.

398
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.000
[ Laughter ]
I'll tell you what happened.


399
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.292
Hey, Paul. You weren't even
here. Shut the fuck up."

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:08.333
[ Laughter ]

401
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.250
And I started reading it
because I never read it.


402
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.833
I was raised Catholic.

403
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:14.042
But they don't encourage you
to read, the church.


404
00:17:14.042 --> 00:17:16.458
They don't. They don't
want you to read this.


405
00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:19.917
You know? Jews read this shit
in Hebrew, and Baptists


406
00:17:19.917 --> 00:17:21.500
sit down,
and they read together.


407
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.417
But the Catholics, they want you
to come in the building.


408
00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.542
They want you to come in,
and they tell you.


409
00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.125
And you're like,
"Can I read it?"


410
00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:29.042
They're like, "No,
I'll tell you what happened.


411
00:17:29.042 --> 00:17:31.167
Sorry. Put the book down."

412
00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:33.875
[ Laughter ]

413
00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.958
But it's interesting because
when you read the stories,


414
00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.625
you know, you think of them
as lofty, kind of, like,


415
00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:43.500
but some of them are just
basic life in Jesus' life.


416
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.167
Okay, here's one.

417
00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:48.542
This is when he turned
water into wine.


418
00:17:48.542 --> 00:17:51.417
This is his first miracle.
This is John Chapter 2.


419
00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:53.375
Okay? Okay.

420
00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:55.375
"And on the third day,

421
00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:58.917
there was a wedding
in Cana of Galilee,


422
00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:01.500
and the mother of Jesus
was there.


423
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.167
And both Jesus was called and
his disciples to the wedding.


424
00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:08.250
And when they wanted wine,

425
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.917
the mother of Jesus
saith unto him,


426
00:18:10.917 --> 00:18:13.125
'They have no wine here.'

[ Laughter ]

428
00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:22.583
And Jesus saith unto her,
"Woman,


429
00:18:22.583 --> 00:18:24.833
What have I to do with thee?"

430
00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:27.417
[ Laughter ]

431
00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:32.250
Just life.
Mary was a fucking alcoholic.


432
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.750
[ Laughter ]
He took her to a wedding.


433
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.083
"There's no fucking wine,
Jesus!


434
00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:41.333
What am I supposed to do here
without wine?!"


435
00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:43.500
[ Laughter ]

436
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.333
And he's like, "Mom!

437
00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:49.125
Don't!"

438
00:18:49.125 --> 00:18:51.167
[ Laughter ]

439
00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:58.375
Anyway, you know, the rest
of the story is that Jesus,


440
00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:00.208
he's at the wedding.
They had no wine. The guy --


441
00:19:00.208 --> 00:19:02.250
So Jesus went to the guy running
the wedding, and he was like,


442
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.667
"Look in the water barrel."
Like that.


443
00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:08.042
Like a closeup magician.
"Why don't you take a look?"


444
00:19:08.042 --> 00:19:09.708
[ Laughter ]

445
00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:11.292
"Maybe it's not the Red Queen.
Go ahead.


446
00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:14.292
Flip that card over.
What do you think?"


447
00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:15.625
Told him to look in
the water barrel,


448
00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:17.458
and he looked, and it was wine.

449
00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:20.958
He had turned all their water
into wine. Everybody rejoiced.


450
00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.292
Except the guy
running the wedding was


451
00:19:22.292 --> 00:19:25.667
probably like,
"We did need some water."


452
00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:28.875
[ Laughter ]

453
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:30.667
"It's actually
a bigger problem."

[ Laughter ]

455
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.708
I have a feeling
a lot of his miracles


456
00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.625
were met with mixed...

457
00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:40.583
Like, "Oh. Thanks.

458
00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:42.500
That's great, Jesus.

459
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.583
Fuck."

[ Laughter ]

461
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:50.000
Like, Lazarus. Lazarus had been
dead for four days,


462
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.625
and Jesus comes to town,
and he says,


463
00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:54.292
"Lazarus, rise,"

464
00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:59.708
and Lazarus comes out of the
tomb like [Groans, coughs]


465
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:01.208
And Lazarus' wife is like,

466
00:20:01.208 --> 00:20:03.833
"Are you fucking kidding me
right now?"


467

[ Laughter ]

468
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.833
But so, here's a story
that I want you to --


469
00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:12.542
I want to read to you.

470
00:20:12.542 --> 00:20:16.583
This story, I've never seen it
in a Jesus movie.


471
00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:19.750
This story is not
in any movies about Jesus.


472
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.458
And it's not --

473
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:23.958
I never -- I never --
Until I sat and read this,


474

But I was raised Catholic, and I
ended up walking away from that

'cause I didn't like it.
You know why?

'Cause they tell you
you're going to hell.

"Oh, you're going to hell.

like, "What did I do?"

my mother is dead,

so I'm half dead
on my mom's side,

about that we were
gonna divorce.

'cause they were 5
and 2 years old at the time.

that they could comprehend.

you know how you love your dog?

your dog food from your plate.

'Don't give the dog any ham,'

but you did 'cause
you love your dog?

00:35:33.417 --> 00:35:37.583
kicks the shit
out of slow and steady.


791
00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:39.917
Slow and steady beats
old and retarded.


792
00:35:39.917 --> 00:35:42.625
That's about it.

793
00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:44.792
Stop telling that to kids.

794
00:35:44.792 --> 00:35:48.208
[ Laughter ]

795
00:35:48.208 --> 00:35:51.167
A lot of what they teach kids is
just to make them polite people.


796
00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:52.625
You know?
Like, they teach them


797
00:35:52.625 --> 00:35:54.375
that there's words
you shouldn't use.


798
00:35:54.375 --> 00:35:55.958
There's bad words.
Don't use the bad words.


799
00:35:55.958 --> 00:35:57.208
I can't teach my kids that

800
00:35:57.208 --> 00:35:59.625
because I do this
for a living.


801
00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:02.958
But I didn't want my kids
to be, you know, assholes.


802
00:36:02.958 --> 00:36:04.500
So I used to
tell them, like, "Okay, look,


803
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.375
there's no bad words.
There's no bad words.


804
00:36:06.375 --> 00:36:08.708
All words are good,
bad, nothing.


805
00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:10.375
But there's some people
that get upset


806
00:36:10.375 --> 00:36:12.250
when you use certain words.

807
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:15.000
So if you're gonna use those
words, look at the person first


808
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.792
and try to guess if they're
that kind of person."

[ Laughter ]

810
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.208
Sometimes you can
offend somebody


811
00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:30.958
when you weren't even trying to.

812
00:36:30.958 --> 00:36:34.125
Like, there's certain --
certain phrases,


813
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.292
certain statements that if
you're gonna say them,


814
00:36:36.292 --> 00:36:40.500
you should say them
without stopping in the middle.


815
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.125
Certain things,
if you're gonna say them,


816
00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:45.167
don't clear your throat
in the middle.


817
00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:47.042
Okay? You don't want
to say things like,


818
00:36:47.042 --> 00:36:49.375
There
are too many black people...

[ Laughter ]
No.


831
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.708
So you want
to get through that one.


832
00:37:25.708 --> 00:37:28.917
Otherwise,
people get the wrong idea.


833
00:37:28.917 --> 00:37:31.375
They'll think you only
fucked that baby once.

[ Laughter ]

835
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.083
But it's tricky, you know.
If you're trying to teach


836
00:37:39.083 --> 00:37:41.625
your kids right from wrong,
you got to choose a side often


837
00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:44.083
because not everybody agrees
on what's right and wrong.


838
00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:45.917
So how do you know?
You know? Like abortion.


839
00:37:45.917 --> 00:37:48.458
Some people think it's
murder. Some people don't.


840
00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:50.208
I personally --
I think people


841
00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:52.333
should get abortions,
like, a lot.


842
00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:54.167
Like, as many as you can.

843
00:37:54.167 --> 00:37:59.125
You should try to get
a lot of abortions.


844
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:02.333
You know why?
'Cause it creates jobs.


845
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:06.583
More abortions, more jobs
for the doctors


846
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:08.583
and the nurses
and the Dumpster guy.


847
00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:12.125
Everybody gets a job.
They have to work.


848
00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:15.125
How are they gonna feed their
kids if you don't kill yours?


849
00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:17.750
It's a whole -- It's -- You
got to think of everybody.


850
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.500
[ Laughter ]

851
00:38:23.292 --> 00:38:24.833
Abortion is a big topic,
of course,


852
00:38:24.833 --> 00:38:26.292
because Roe v. Wade
was overturned.


853
00:38:26.292 --> 00:38:28.042
Roe vs. Wade.

854
00:38:28.042 --> 00:38:29.333
Of course,
we all know what this is.


855
00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:31.125
This was a court case.

856
00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:33.375
Roe was a woman
who wanted an abortion,


857
00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:36.250
and Wade was the baby, I guess.
I don't know.


858
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.042
[ Laughter ]
I don't know.


859
00:38:43.417 --> 00:38:47.208
I'm just assuming. I never
found out who Wade was.


860
00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:48.708
Wade must have been
the baby. Anyway...


861
00:38:48.708 --> 00:38:51.333
[ Laughter ]

862
00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:55.375
But now that we don't
have that, every state has


863
00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:57.833
to come up with their own law
based on how people feel.


864
00:38:57.833 --> 00:38:59.500
They have to listen to people
and see how they feel.


865
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.958
I think most Americans
feel on average


866
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:04.208
the same thing about abortion.
They feel like people


867
00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:06.000
should be able to get abortions
if they need them,


868
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.667
but, you know, just, uh, keep it
down a little bit. That's all.


869
00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:10.125
Just...

870
00:39:10.125 --> 00:39:13.583
Just go ahead,
but, you know, come on, come on.


871
00:39:13.583 --> 00:39:16.375
You know, do it, but don't be
like, "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"


872
00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:17.958
Like, just, you know.

873
00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:20.708
[ Laughter ]

874
00:39:20.708 --> 00:39:23.458
So we need a law that covers
that, that keeps it available,


875
00:39:23.458 --> 00:39:25.250
but limits it.
Here's what I think


876
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.542
we should do.
Let's make this law.


877
00:39:26.542 --> 00:39:29.333
You can get an abortion anytime,
anywhere.


878
00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:30.833
But if you get an abortion,

879
00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:32.917
you have to eat it.
I think that's fair.


880
00:39:32.917 --> 00:39:37.542
Because that'll keep it --
That'll make you, "Hmm.


881
00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:39.667
Fuck. I gotta eat it?

882

883
00:39:41.458 --> 00:39:44.208

I better do it soon."

00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:46.500
[ Laughter ]

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.250
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:59.417
Just trying to make
everybody happy, you know?

00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:01.250
[ Laughter ]

888
00:40:03.542 --> 00:40:06.208
Some -
- Some Catholics believe

889
00:40:06.208 --> 00:40:08.000
that contraception
is murder.


890
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.542
They think if you wear a condom,

891
00:40:09.542 --> 00:40:11.792
if you stop a sperm
from getting to an egg,


892
00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:13.917
you killed a possible baby.

893
00:40:13.917 --> 00:40:15.958
By that logic,
I could say that any woman


894
00:40:15.958 --> 00:40:18.125
that won't fuck me
is a murderer.


895
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:21.583
[ Laughter ]

896
00:40:21.583 --> 00:40:23.208
Let me tell you, there's a bunch

897
00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:25.208
of murdering bitches
out there.


898
00:40:25.208 --> 00:40:27.458
But...

899
00:40:29.417 --> 00:40:31.833
...murder
is a weird law structure.


900
00:40:31.833 --> 00:40:35.167
Also, that is not a sentence.
Didn't make any sense, but...


901
00:40:35.167 --> 00:40:37.333
murder should be simple
because it's a binary crime.


902
00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:39.458
You kill somebody, or you don't.
They're alive, or they're dead.


903
00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:41.083
It's one or the other.
But --


904
00:40:41.083 --> 00:40:42.833
But the laws around murder
are a little murky.


905
00:40:42.833 --> 00:40:45.083
One person could kill somebody,
get 100 years.


906
00:40:45.083 --> 00:40:47.583
Somebody else gets 20.
Why? What's the difference?


907
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:49.917
Here's what they base
your sentence on with murder.


908
00:40:49.917 --> 00:40:55.167
They base it on how you felt
when you murdered them.


909
00:40:55.167 --> 00:40:58.250
That's weirdly important.

910
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.917
They say, "Okay,
you shot him in the face.


911
00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:05.833
But what was up with you,
man? Like, what was going on?


912
00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:08.667
[ Laughter ]
Like, come on."


913
00:41:12.542 --> 00:41:14.208
I think if you murder somebody,

914
00:41:14.208 --> 00:41:16.208
your sentence should be based
on how old the person


915
00:41:16.208 --> 00:41:18.208
was that you murdered.

916
00:41:18.208 --> 00:41:21.083
That should matter. How much
of their life did you take away?


917
00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:23.208
Like, if you see
a 3-year-old girl in the park,


918
00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:25.375
and you just kick her
to death...

It's a hypothetical.
Fucking grow up.

00:41:30.292 --> 00:41:31.542
It's a hypothetical.

923
00:41:31.542 --> 00:41:34.625
I'm not asking you
to go do that.


924
00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:38.125
I'm just asking you
to just really imagine


925
00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:43.042
just kicking a 3-year-old
till she's dead.

[ Laughter ]

927
00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:55.833
All right.

928
00:41:55.833 --> 00:41:59.333
If you kill a 3-year-old,
you should do a lot of time.


929
00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:01.000
You should do a lot of time.

930
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.250
Unless she's got, like,
diabetes.


931
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.125
You got to work it all in.
But...


932
00:42:04.125 --> 00:42:08.875
But what if...

933
00:42:08.875 --> 00:42:13.042
What if you kill somebody
who's, like, 98?


934
00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:15.333
He's 98, and he's, like,
in a hospice.

He's not even good 98.

I decided to stop exercising.

That's what
I decided this year.

I'm just not doing it anymore.
I made it to 55.

If I stop exercising now,

1079
00:49:00.417 --> 00:49:02.917
it just means
I might make 75 instead of 78.

It's not that big
a fucking deal.

I'm just not gonna do it.

was Trump.

It's the one thing
he said that I liked.

I don't know if you've
ever heard this,

He just believes.
Nobody told him this.


1087
00:49:16.708 --> 00:49:17.875
But he believes
that you should

00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:21.500
move as little as possible

1089
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.333
because you have a finite amount
of movements

00:49:24.333 --> 00:49:26.708
and then you just --
You stop.


1091
00:49:26.708 --> 00:49:29.167
He believes that. He just went,
"Yeah, that sounds right."


1092
00:49:29.167 --> 00:49:33.708
And he just thought it up.

00:49:33.708 --> 00:49:34.958
And he's proving it
to be true.

I don't like the new exercise
either.

and there's a video
that encourages you.

And they have that mirror
that you stand there,

and it teaches you
exercises.

Then they have that gun you put
in your mouth,

You should not kill yourself.

That's my opinion.
I don't know you.

But my general feeling is,
you shouldn't kill yourself.


1112

You know why? 'Cause you're
gonna die anyway.

You're gonna die. What are you
getting violent for?

It really is
the most effective argument


1120
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:34.500
against suicide, is that you're
gonna die either way.


1121
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.667
It also happens to be the
best argument for suicide,


1122
00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:39.375
which is awkward.

1123

Go ahead. You're gonna die
if you don't.

a friend of mine sent me
a porn the other day.

Folks can just send you
pornography now.

It was a porn.
It was two old men.

each other's cocks.

But there they were.


1134

One of them is, like, sitting on
the edge of a bed, and his socks

is on his knees on a pillow.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.792
And he's just fucking blowing
the guy.


1139
00:51:27.792 --> 00:51:30.083
Then they switch places.

1140
00:51:30.083 --> 00:51:33.292

see them switch places.

And when the second guy
was done,


1143
00:51:40.292 --> 00:51:45.083
I called my friend and said,
"Why did you send me this?"


1144
00:51:45.083 --> 00:51:48.417
He said, "Because it's amazing."

And it really was, you know?
It really was.

I've watched it a few times

because it doesn't turn me on.

about old guys.

with just a grapefruit
in a plastic bag, you know?

another guy's cock.

But I'm older now.

1248
00:56:06.792 --> 00:56:08.542
I'm divorced, and
I still


1249
00:56:08.542 --> 00:56:11.208
date mostly women who are
younger than me recently


1250
00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:13.542
'cause that's who looks better.

1251
00:56:13.542 --> 00:56:15.375
[ Laughs ]
No, no.


1252
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:18.417
No, it's true.

1253
00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:19.875
But I'm not --
I don't like having --


1254
00:56:19.875 --> 00:56:21.500
I've always been with women
my age or older.


1255
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.375
I was married to a woman
a year older than me


1256
00:56:23.375 --> 00:56:24.750
for ten years.
And that's always


1257
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.542
been the way I've been.
But, you know,


1258
00:56:26.542 --> 00:56:28.542
there's some guys that have
to be with a younger woman.


1259
00:56:28.542 --> 00:56:30.000
There's -
- There's cultures

1260
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.958
that believe the man
should be much older.


1261
00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:34.875
Like, there's religions
that have, like, a formula,


1262
00:56:34.875 --> 00:56:38.917
you know? Like take
the man's age and subtract ten,


1263
00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:41.083
and then whatever else
you have to do to get to 12.


1264
00:56:41.083 --> 00:56:43.042
Just get to...

1265
00:56:43.042 --> 00:56:47.167
Just -
- Just solve for 12.

[ Laughter ]

1267
00:56:50.958 --> 00:56:53.167
But I didn't suddenly get
interested in younger women.


1268
00:56:53.167 --> 00:56:54.375
What happened was,
I got older,


1269
00:56:54.375 --> 00:56:55.708
and they got interested
in me


1270
00:56:55.708 --> 00:56:57.292
'cause the younger women,
like older guys.


1271
00:56:57.292 --> 00:56:59.500
They just do. That's
the other part nobody says.


1272
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.000
I don't do anything to get
younger women.


1273
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.042
I just stand there like this,

1274
00:57:03.042 --> 00:57:04.583
and they see me,
and they're like,


1275
00:57:04.583 --> 00:57:07.125
"That would be so weird
to fuck that old guy."

[ Laughter ]

1277
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.542
And then we get blamed.

1278
00:57:10.542 --> 00:57:11.958
The older guy
always gets blamed.


1279
00:57:11.958 --> 00:57:13.583
You see an older man
with a young woman.


1280
00:57:13.583 --> 00:57:15.250
Everybody's like,
"That guy's a pervert."


1281
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.958
No, she's a pervert.

1282
00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:20.167
He's normal.
He likes pretty women.


1283
00:57:20.167 --> 00:57:23.000
She likes that.

The fuck is wrong with her?

1286
00:57:28.875 --> 00:57:30.583
And they're weird.

1287
00:57:30.583 --> 00:57:32.958
I was having sex with this
woman, and she was about 35.


1288
00:57:32.958 --> 00:57:36.083
And we're in bed.
She starts calling me "daddy."

young lady.

Please don't do that."

1291
00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:42.167
She said, "Why does it
make you uncomfortable


1292
00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:43.500
when I call you 'daddy'
during sex?"


1293
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.125
Is it 'cause
you have daughters?"


1294
00:57:45.125 --> 00:57:46.583
I said, "No.

1295
00:57:46.583 --> 00:57:51.542
It makes me uncomfortable
because I have a father.


1296
00:57:51.542 --> 00:57:56.458
And I used to call him 'daddy'
when he fucked me.

It's not his fault.
I made him do it.
