1
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.829
THE LAST MISTRESS

2
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.866
Paris, February 1835

3
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.911
In the age of Chaderlos de Laclos...

4
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.185
My dear...

5
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.549
You've grasped me
by the only handle left to me,


6
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.907
the supreme passion,

7
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.861
that locks out all the others,

8
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.705
the cardinal sin of gluttony.

9
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.350
Sadly.

10
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.463
The only sin left,
the last one.


11
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.425
Indeed!

12
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.548
They're the delights of Capua!

13
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.224
But Hannibal mustn't linger
on those delights.


14
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.622
No, I'll go to Canossa for you.
I promise.


15
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.705
Or more precisely to 46 rue des Carmes,
at Senora Vellini's.


16
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.388
So that species has a name?

17
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.066
Yes, she's Spanish,

18
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.906
born in 1799 in Malaga,

19
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.028
So that...

20
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.310
So that...
she's 36 years old.


21
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.271
A good age to make way for another.

22
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.663
Has your best friend
the Marquise de Flers,


23
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.583
lost her mind?

24
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.345
What has this Marigny done to her?

25
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.788
He's a womanizer
and a gambler, and penniless...


26
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.066
I know...

27
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.031
And she lets him many
her wealthy granddaughter?


28
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.741
The jewel of the French aristocracy!
That's the limit!


29
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.587
She, who was always so wise,
has taken leave of her senses!


30
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.822
She should marry him herself!

31
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.948
Hold your tongue!

32
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.546
It's the talk of the town,
dear friend!


33
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.829
Here we are - 46 rue des Cannes.

34
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.263
I shall inform the Senora

35
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.311
of the wedding of Miss de Polastron
to her beloved Marigny


36
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.862
and I hope to provoke quite a scandal.

37
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.864
If it managed to dash this marriage,

38
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.102
you'd pleasure me more
than you ever did.


39
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.147
Such ingratitude!

40
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.265
Monsieur de Prony!

41
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.388
In person.

42
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.780
How fares my pretty?

43
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.743
- Is the Senora at home to visitors?
- Yes, sir.


44
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.145
I'll keep the stick, I need it.

45
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.382
Monsieur de Prony, Madame.

46
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.102
Well, then... So how is
the Goddess of Capriciousness?


47
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.981
You're just as capricious, Viscount.

48
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.267
You used to visit me,

49
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.263
you came often.

50
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.504
You seemed to hold me
in your affection. Then basta!


51
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.869
One fine day,
you disappeared without warning.


52
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.946
I was taking the waters, my dear...

53
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.547
Taking the waters,
for two whole years?


54
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.510
You're not in earnest, Viscount!

55
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.985
Anyway, it hasn't done much
for your gout!


56
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.262
None of us are getting
any younger, my dear!


57
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.305
You still see Monsieur de Marigny?

58
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.183
Certainly.

59
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.263
Is it long since his last visit?

60
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.140
He comes when he pleases,
he is free...


61
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.271
Do many people meet every day
after ten years?


62
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.503
Ten years
of a less than perfect fidelity.


63
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.707
Neither of us has been faithful.

64
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.424
It's been an unusual relationship.

65
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.143
With more hate than love.

66
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.823
All the better!

67
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.311
I'd be sorry to see you unhappy.

68
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.431
Are you aware of Monsieur de Maligny's
forthcoming wedding?


69
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.628
Don't worry.

70
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.705
With each woman he has had,
in your world or mine,


71
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.750
people ran to tell me.

72
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.187
Twice if not once.

73
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.784
He'll come back to me, as always.

74
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.708
This time it's more than a love affair,

75
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.589
it's a marriage.

76
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.584
Well...

77
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.308
If you insist,

78
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.465
it's a love affair and a marriage,

79
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.941
but it's not an ending.

80
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.703
An ending

81
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.470
to the liaison
between Marigny and myself,


82
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.225
there is none, 
Monsieur de Prony!

83
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.351
So you're unfaithful tonight,

84
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.310
to your lovely fiance,
Monsieur de Marigny?


85
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.221
You're not at Madame de Flers?

86
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.871
No, sir. Nor are you
at Madame d'Artelles's.


87
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.829
I dined there.

88
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.270
What's the matter?

89
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.790
Nothing...

90
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.983
See how you lie.

91
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.464
Leave me, Ryno!

92
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.705
- Leave me...
- Not on your life.


93
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.948
Why do you want to escape me?

94
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.347
What did that viper
of a Viscount say


95
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.787
to put you in such a fluster?

96
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.791
Nothing I didn't already know.

97
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.461
It's just that he took such delight
in telling me.


98
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.228
You're hurting yourself.

99
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.026
You pay too much attention
to people and their unkind words.


100
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.030
What do they know about you and I?

101
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.142
What can they understand about us?

102
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.749
Nothing...

103
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.941
They understand nothing...

104
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.147
He won't come now,
it's past midnight.


105
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.547
- He might yet arrive.
- What if he did?


106
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.227
If he found you here,
he'd know you had waited for him.


107
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.951
Where would that get us?

108
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.227
Never let men rule you.

109
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.191
The most sincere love
isn't devoid of conceit.


110
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.671
Your grandmother is right.

111
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.224
It's his loss.
Go to bed like a good girl,


112
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.941
and tomorrow,
act with coolness toward him.


113
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.990
Pretend to be uninterested in him.

114
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.142
Now she has retired,
allow me to predict


115
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.145
that she'll be incapable
of the slightest stratagem.


116
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.222
She already loves him too much.

117
00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.350
What's wrong with loving the man
she'll many in a week?


118
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.991
We are not old for nothing, my dear.

119
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.744
You know as well as I do

120
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.348
that one must never give a man
the certainty of conquest.


121
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.787
That young girls,
and even their mothers,


122
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.624
are taken in,

123
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.067
is a law of our species.

124
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.871
We would never become mothers,

125
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.261
if we were clear-sighted.

126
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.742
But when even grandmothers

127
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.791
are fooled by this pitiful
comedy of seduction...


128
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.431
It's because I'm much younger
than my age.


129
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.743
I was charmed and mesmerized
like the others,


130
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.391
and so happy about it, dear Countess,

131
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.030
that your bad auguries

132
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.502
have no power to weaken my optimism.

133
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.106
What you're saying is most grave.

134
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.865
He has turned your head more than hers.

135
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.101
Hasn't he?

136
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.784
Here, have a cup.

137
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.669
To pick you up.

138
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.510
It's no laughing matter, I assure you.

139
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.307
Have you no remorse,
on the eve of this wedding,


140
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:11.102
of marrying your granddaughter
to a mere gentleman without title,


141
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.945
a penniless adventurer.

142
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.626
She's rich enough for both of them.

143
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.351
What's more,
he's an unbridled libertine,


144
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.663
who has no scruples
in compromising his conquests.


145
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.061
You and I belong
to the age of Laclos.

146
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.906
An age when such matters
were easily forgiven.


147
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.109
The young people we knew,
and loved,


148
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.501
were far worse than those of today,

149
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.550
and yet we didn't become old maids.

150
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.944
Our mothers had the courage
to marry us to some dreadful rascals,


151
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.706
and we had the brazen good luck
to be quite happy.


152
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.542
You can talk -
you bewitched the Marquis de Flers.


153
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.385
Hermangarde is prettier than I was,
shell manage.


154
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.145
She doesn't have your talent
for strategy.


155
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.826
In love, the first to suffer has lost.

156
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.550
She's already trapped.

157
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.021
Hermangarde is what I cherish most.

158
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.068
Would I let her navigate alone

159
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.145
on the ocean of perfidy
that is men's hearts? No.


160
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.106
This marriage will be my masterpiece.

161
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.308
Your masterpiece!

162
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.270
You're even madder than they say.

163
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.981
Goodbye, my friend.

164
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.746
And where might he be
this evening?


165
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.590
He has a mistress, dear Marquise.

166
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.061
He has had for ten years.

167
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:40.067
Only you and I
were unaware of it until now.


168
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.902
I hate you.

169
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.467
You'll come back to me, Ryno.

170
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.350
I say it without a trace of joy,

171
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.388
without pride,

172
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.751
without triumphant jealousy.

173
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.944
You'll trample on the girl you're marrying
and come back to me.


174
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.225
I've never loved anyone as I love her.

175
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.428
Not even you, Vellini.

176
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.828
The feelings you stirred
in my heart at 20,


177
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.983
she has revived in a heart of 30,

178
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.188
which is old and worn.

179
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.550
You don't cheat on the one you love
with someone you no longer love.


180
00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.902
Is that what you believe?

181
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.949
I warned you this evening
meant goodbye.


182
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.628
So goodbye.

183
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.626
May what you say be true...

184
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.625
Oliva!

185
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.180
See Monsieur de Marigny out.

186
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.109
Monsieur de Cerisy has waited
two hours in the library.


187
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.105
Let him wait. Or let him leave.

188
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.182
In any case, I'm free.

189
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.070
I owe nobody nothing.

190
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.624
When all Paris was up in arms

191
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.671
about his liaisons
with Madame de Mendoze and others,


192
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.267
he was deceiving them
with that creature.


193
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.060
A courtesan on the wane,

194
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.267
and rather vulgar, I hear...

195
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.423
I'll let you guess
what men seek in her.

196
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.709
Vulgar or not, she must be very crafty

197
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.182
to wrest Monsieur de Marigny
from so many women.


198
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.546
After too much sweetness,

199
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.783
one may appreciate
the scent of an alkali.


200
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.466
Still, ten years!

201
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.702
Persian marriages only last seven.

202
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.626
Ten years together without
being compelled to it by law.


203
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.510
That's unheard of in Paris.

204
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.987
I know we're late.

205
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.943
If a box is rented by the year,
I can arrive late if I want.


206
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.222
Time you retired, my child.

207
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.190
I must have a last word
with Monsieur de Marigny.


208
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.027
This secrecy means you're plotting?

209
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.547
Perhaps. Come and kiss me,
and leave us.


210
00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.990
Don't be jealous,

211
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.510
in two days he'll be all yours.

212
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.629
And you, I permit you to kiss her...

213
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.111
There.

214
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.667
What if that was your goodbye kiss?

215
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.986
Yes, if it were the last kiss,

216
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.188
and you never saw her again?

217
00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.944
And I canceled the wedding?

218
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.865
What have I done?

219
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.501
Nothing. I chose you,
despite all the warnings.


220
00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.106
But listen, Monsieur de Marigny,

221
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.501
those warnings have become
so alarming...


222
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.623
I was sure of it.

223
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.668
When I met Viscount de Prony

224
00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.664
as I left the house of a woman
I know well,


225
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.662
I guessed he'd been sent
by Countess d'Artelles.


226
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.706
She tried hard to stop this marriage.

227
00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.423
Let's be frank -

228
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.743
you've been what is known
as a libertine.


229
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.620
Even if your heart is loftier
than your morals,


230
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.671
you have had an intimate relationship

231
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.105
with that Vellini.

232
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.467
A sort of kept woman,

233
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.589
and have lived with her for ten years.

234
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.585
That is so.

235
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.231
She was my mistress,
but she no longer is.


236
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.109
What? She no longer is?

237
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.389
When you're not here,
you're at her house.


238
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.508
When one is as smitten as I,

239
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.503
and one is loved in return

240
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.948
by someone as sublime
as Miss de Polastron,


241
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.307
there's no room for other sentiments.

242
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.142
I do believe you sincerely love
my granddaughter,


243
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.541
but what if I was unable to believe

244
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.988
that this ten year affair
that you admit to,


245
00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.381
is indeed finished,

246
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.066
when you're still seeing that woman?

247
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.541
You would do me great offense.

248
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.385
If I gave my word
to the Marquise de Flers,


249
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.862
Miss de Polastron's grandmother,
she must believe me.


250
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.064
I believe you.

251
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.670
When did she cease
to be your mistress?


252
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.549
A long time ago.

253
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.227
But let us be quite clear...

254
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.420
I'll be completely frank with you.

255
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.789
You're too far above other women
to reproach me my sincerity.


256
00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.226
It's now a long time
since Vellini was my mistress.


257
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.066
We separated amicably
long before I met Hermangarde.


258
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.708
But if I were to deny

259
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.465
that habit inexorably took me back

260
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.508
to this woman, my former love...

261
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.626
and that each time...

262
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.750
I yielded for a few hours
to the burning feelings of the past,


263
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.910
then I'd be lying.

264
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.631
I see the distinction, and accept it.

265
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.704
Still, for Hermangarde,
and for polite society,


266
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:52.388
whether you love her or not,
that woman is your mistress.


267
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.224
The wrong, the danger

268
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.622
here is less in the feelings
than in the situation.


269
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.068
You're right,
but the situation is no longer.


270
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.586
The day Viscount de Prony saw me,

271
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.549
I said goodbye to Senora Vellini.

272
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.666
Why didn't you say so sooner,
my boy?


273
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.141
You would have eased my mind.

274
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.621
Now, I'm reassured.

275
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.065
But tell me,

276
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.986
won't this woman create a commotion
Sunday at your wedding?


277
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.746
Countess d'Artelles
and Monsieur de Prony are sure...


278
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.981
They don't know Vellini.

279
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.791
She's too proud
to degrade herself like that.


280
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.668
Some may see her as a creature,

281
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.346
but she's a woman of great nobility.

282
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.222
But I understand why you fear
a moment of weakness.


283
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.787
I told you I plan to leave Paris
right after my wedding.


284
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.700
I can promise you
it will be for good.

285
00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.825
I'm not insisting on that.

286
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.791
You love Paris too much
to bury yourself in the provinces.


287
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.227
I'm not a barbarous grandmother

288
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.588
guarding the fidelity
due her granddaughter.


289
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.863
It is Hermangarde I love,

290
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.710
and

291
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.385
Although everything is over
between Vellini and I,


292
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.863
being near such a woman
is good for no man.


293
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.950
I, more than any other,
must fear and avoid it.


294
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.984
You must have really loved her,
to still fear her so.


295
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.103
Damn herb teas,
let's have some port wine.


296
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.421
It'll cheer us up.

297
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.230
You know I devised that trip
to the opera,


298
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.109
I who hate going out,

299
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.750
just see her from closer.

300
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.788
You'd have been disappointed.

301
00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.070
Vellini

302
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.667
doesn't justify for many
the power she has over some.


303
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.549
So I've been told, yes.

304
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.146
But how did you become
one of her victims,


305
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.460
Monsieur de Marigny?

306
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.862
You're reputed to be
a most formidable Don Juan.


307
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.027
The truth is so far from that.

308
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.026
For ten years,
I was indeed under her spell.


309
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.068
But we were each others victims.

310
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.142
Sometimes in turn.

311
00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.984
Sometimes together.

312
00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.947
- It's a sad tale.
- Tell it to me.


313
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.351
To what end?

314
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.149
What better sign of friendship
can you give me,


315
00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.190
I, who'll become your grandmother
on Sunday,


316
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.501
than the trust of your past?

317
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.983
So I know everything about the husband
I chose for Hermangarde.


318
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.869
Since you command me...

319
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.900
It began ten years ago.

320
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.746
I was returning from Baden,
at the end of the summer.


321
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.941
There I had surrendered to my taste
for women and gambling.


322
00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:27.025
I was weary, as one is
after the intense pursuit of pleasure...


323
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.826
I was at the
Opera with a married woman

324
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.107
who bestowed her favors on me,

325
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.626
but was becoming possessive.

326
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.664
I'll be right back

327
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.785
Ryno.

328
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.546
What a fine surprise. Sit down.

329
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.183
- Where were you heading?
- I was fleeing.


330
00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.587
If faithful husbands who envy us
knew how unhappy we are...


331
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.506
when their wives,
who we idolized, yield to us.


332
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:39.863
The disillusion and boredom
that result from their surrender.


333
00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.068
I'm just back from Spain

334
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.904
with a horde of curiosities.

335
00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.263
And one that I'd like you to admire.

336
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.830
It's not an object, it's a woman.

337
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.584
From Malaga...

338
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.428
a capricious flamenca
who can outstare the sun.


339
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.982
How amazing. There she is.

340
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.304
Yet you won't understand...

341
00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.825
How so?

342
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.063
She's a bit..."moorish".

343
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.751
Just come to dinner tomorrow.

344
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.906
A costume party for them,
my houseguests.


345
00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.301
You'll see what I see in her.

346
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.424
The illegitimate child
of an Italian princess


347
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.151
and a famed Spanish matador...

348
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.905
She led a shady life in Seville

349
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.026
before being rescued by a marriage

350
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.467
to a wealthy English baronet.

351
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.067
You're not English,
and too young to fall for...


352
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.710
that ugly mutt.

353
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.342
- It would be pure vice.
- Beware, your voice carries.


354
00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.350
Too late. She heard you.

355
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.791
Miss Marie
-Cornelie Falcone.

356
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.184
You're the first.

357
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.470
Sir Reginald Annesley,
meet our leading soprano.


358
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.781
In London we adore you.

359
00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.103
- What are you singing now?
- I just did "lphigenia".


360
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.786
Monsieur Ryno de Marigny.

361
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.146
Ryno, you look no different.

362
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.585
I hate disguises.

363
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.061
You made no effort, that's perfect.

364
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.505
Come.

365
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.428
Lady Vellini Annesley...
Ryno de Marigny.


366
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.586
What are you disguised as?

367
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.866
I said, what are you disguised as?

368
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.385
The devil.

369
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.703
I bought a little knick-knack...

370
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.350
A little box

371
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.741
Its lid reminds me strangely

372
00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.982
of one of the loveliest guests here.

373
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.301
Look, pass it around...

374
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.825
You hardly looked at it.

375
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.666
I so admired you in Alice
by Robert Le Diable,


376
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.742
You're our finest voice.

377
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.231
Thank you.

378
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.744
What is if?

379
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.390
I wore my stage costume,
I thought it would do.


380
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.542
Costume parties are a bore.

381
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.787
You me as a she-devil?

382
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.307
No, as the devil.
I hate anything feminine.


383
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.348
Except in young men, of course.

384
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.422
Of course.

385
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.663
Like Titian's
Portrait of Lorenzo De Medici,


386
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.821
or Lotto's
Portrait of a Young Man.


387
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.390
That's my glass.

388
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.744
I want to read your thoughts.

389
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.230
Not a chance.

390
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.424
My blunder has hurt you?

391
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.821
Not your "blunder", your "conceit".

392
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.551
That's inexcusable.

393
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.784
Then I won't excuse myself.

394
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.544
Well?

395
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.031
My dear Count,

396
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.626
if you wanted sole possession
of this woman,


397
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.986
you shouldn't have asked me to dinner.

398
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.030
I'll fight you obstinately for her.

399
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.542
I accept the challenge.

400
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.863
But I warn you - she loathes you.

401
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.950
We'll see.

402
00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.307
If you weren't already wed,

403
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.667
I'd ask you to
marry me on the spot.

404
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.584
But...

405
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.867
you're not English and too young,

406
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.023
to indulge in such folly.

407
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.385
It would be pure vice.

408
00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.790
Spanish women are as vain
as French women.


409
00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.066
No.

410
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.911
But they sense an insult,

411
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.063
and can hate
even better than they can love.


412
00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.025
Forgive me.

413
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.946
It was a premature and silly opinion.

414
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.864
Just chatter.

415
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.422
I have nothing to forgive you.

416
00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.781
Likes and dislikes are involuntary.

417
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.102
Let me play him.

418
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.344
It is my wife

419
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.344
who brings me luck...

420
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.945
I couldn't avoid the Marauil townhouse

421
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.105
knowing that haughty
and heartless creature would be there


422
00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.582
to mock the madness of
my undertaking...


423
00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.942
- Sir Reginald Annesley isn't in, sir.
- I know she's in, I saw her.


424
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.784
I have orders to keep you out.

425
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.625
Count de Mareuil is a personal friend.

426
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.020
Brawling in my house?

427
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.343
Let go of Monsieur de Marigny.

428
00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.790
I've come every day, left my card.

429
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.942
The Senora's hatred of you has grown

430
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.342
since that dinner
where you changed your mind.


431
00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.822
She delights in amusing
her husband's jealousy,


432
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.904
by describing
how openly you courted her,


433
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.711
claiming her virtue has been offended.

434
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.267
The hussy.

435
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.144
So the very polite Sir Reginald Annesley,
an amiable baronet,


436
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.541
feels he can act, not as a gentleman,

437
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.463
but as an informed husband.

438
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.385
- Let me see her.
- Impossible.


439
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.621
I ruined myself for her.

440
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.350
I have but a sou to live on,

441
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.391
and I'd gladly lose that
to see her just once.


442
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.702
You who live beside her,
can't you plead my cause?


443
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.748
It would be pointless.

444
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.390
Forget her...

445
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.310
Or pray to God.

446
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.706
At St Gervais Church, at Vespers.

447
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.270
Spanish ladies are devout.

448
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.788
I'll be eternally grateful to you.

449
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.104
My pride couldn't offer itself
any consolation.


450
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.462
Clearly, she disliked me
as much as she'd said.


451
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:38.022
Every aftermoon,
I haunted the Bois de Boulogne,


452
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.865
at the hour favored
by fashionable strollers,


453
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.111
on the off chance of meeting her.

454
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.750
Madame...

455
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:13.109
Chance is kinder than you -
it arranged this appointment.


456
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.625
Chance is a fool.

457
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.704
What appointment? 
It's an encounter.

458
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.465
That's your path. This is mine. Pass by.

459
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.549
I'd be a fool to waste this chance
to see you.


460
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.231
Sir Reginald stopped off briefly,

461
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.780
he'll be here in an instant.

462
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.268
How base to bring up your husband.

463
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.227
Say you trust in my repentance.

464
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.586
I have only this
to say to you -

465
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.264
for the second time, pass by.

466
00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.870
You brand so well what is yours,

467
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.704
that I crave a second mark.

468
00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.305
Reginald.

469
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.587
That name hurts more than your whip.

470
00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.708
I'll stifle it on your lips.

471
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.581
At four paces, and fire.

472
00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.104
Not now, sir.

473
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.628
Not in front of Madame.

474
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.624
Tomorrow at a time of your choosing.

475
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.670
At six in the morning,

476
00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.425
in this wood that saw the affront,

477
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.707
and shall see the punishment.

478
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.862
Why not now?

479
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.550
I'd have enjoyed
seeing you killed today.


480
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.861
Look.

481
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.664
She came in person,
just to see me die.

482
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.629
It's outrageous.

483
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.907
I'll chide Sir Reginald about this.

484
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.948
A woman has no place here.

485
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.022
Do nothing of the sort.

486
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.386
The matadors daughter wants blood -
let her see it flow.


487
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.910
My witnesses...

488
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.147
Monsieur de Marigny asked me first.

489
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.348
And Count de Cerisy.

490
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.229
Here are mine.

491
00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.700
I hope my husband kills you.

492
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.390
- Run for a surgeon.
- My God, the masters wounded.


493
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.829
Don't move.

494
00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.349
You're mad. What are you doing?

495
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.629
I want to drink his blood.
No one can stop me.


496
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.029
Will he die?

497
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.621
Will he die?

498
00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.623
After what you just did.

499
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.910
His wound has a greater chance
of becoming infected.


500
00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:10.349
The wound was so deep - for two months
I hung between life and death,


501
00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.582
racked by atrocious pains.

502
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.983
Yet I followed the doctor's orders,

503
00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.346
with the blind obedience of a man
desperate to get well.


504
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.781
Marquise.

505
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.741
I wanted to get
well to see her again.

506
00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.547
That same dream again...

507
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.421
My God, I'm still dreaming...

508
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.262
I surrender, Ryno.

509
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.661
I struggled hard,

510
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.708
but I am beaten.

511
00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.584
Though cured of my wounds,

512
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.230
I remained in there

513
00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.190
where Vellini came very early

514
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.982
and left just before dawn.

515
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.387
The odor of love...

516
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.350
Hold me tight...

517
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.709
l love...

518
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.024
Ryno...

519
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.668
I miss you already.

520
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.586
You don't have another, I hope.

521
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.431
I swear.

522
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.788
Too easy. Swear it, on my head.

523
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.591
I swear it.

524
00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.505
Locking me in?

525
00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.662
Double-locking you.

526
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.823
Like your slave?

527
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.502
My prisoner.

528
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.620
Later you'll be my slave.

529
00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:42.381
Ten past seven.
How punctual you are.


530
00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.589
You never miss roll-call,

531
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.947
like clockwork.

532
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.060
Why are you still up?

533
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.507
I'm trying to tell you...

534
00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:00.544
Given the very limited nature
of our life together,


535
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.748
I could, if I so wished,

536
00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.908
sleep elsewhere every night

537
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.381
without you noticing...

538
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.944
Listen to what I'm saying.

539
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.750
Let go of me.

540
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.623
Go sleep off your drunkenness,
as usual.


541
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.825
Sorry.

542
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.024
You're my wife.

543
00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.624
Not for much longer.

544
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.584
My leaving has nothing to do with you.

545
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.906
I'll always be grateful

546
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.631
that you made me your legitimate wife.

547
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.431
But I love Ryno de Marigny.

548
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.741
One can't fight that.

549
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.067
The next day,
all of Paris,


550
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.751
the young things seen in chic cafes

551
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.822
and boxes at the opera...

552
00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.064
knew Lady Annesley had left her husband.

553
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.221
The scandal was huge.

554
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:57.302
I, being upper crust
by my birth and acquaintances,


555
00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.941
suddenly inspired all kinds of honors

556
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.102
in ladies who you know,

557
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.825
but who didn't ban me from their salons.

558
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.869
Vellini, who wasn't part
of that gossipy and judgmental set,


559
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.830
didn't suffer from what
she was unaware of.


560
00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.028
Though Paris, for a year,

561
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.865
was the start of a liaison
that lasted for ten.


562
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.790
There.

563
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.750
No, you can't stop now.

564
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.346
Tell me all about those ten years.

565
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:56.383
After that year, we left for Algeria.

566
00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.388
We had a little daughter.

567
00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.788
It's been five days...

568
00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.067
We can't stay this way.

569
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.664
We must bury her.

570
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.424
Let's burn her instead.

571
00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.030
This thing...

572
00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:09.064
that...

573
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.268
here and in this place...

574
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.465
was no longer love
but an unending fury...


575
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.231
a kind of barbarous rape...

576
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.467
I disapproved of it heart and soul.

577
00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.348
But nothing could sway her...

578
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.426
She had to go through with it.

579
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.468
And I had to let her...

580
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:55.547
even if it made me feel disgusted
with myself.


581
00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.821
Don't be ashamed, I understand.

582
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.188
Back in Paris...

583
00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:34.986
our relationship became
a wretched repetition of that night.


584
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.186
Our daughter's death
had placed a wall between us...


585
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.541
I no longer existed in her eyes...

586
00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.471
Except...

587
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.702
that she was so totally organized
for pleasure...


588
00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.902
that she always needed it.

589
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.461
At such times, I hated her.

590
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.830
I went as far
as to wish her dead.

591
00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.221
I began to submerge her
with bitter words,


592
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.348
poisoned by disgust.

593
00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.061
I left the house more and more,

594
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.948
vowing to end the relationship.

595
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:39.542
When I'd get home,
she was still as I'd left her.


596
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.826
The only thing which kept us together

597
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.466
was the bottomless abyss
of our caresses,


598
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.906
and we threw ourselves into it,
Marquise,


599
00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.184
worse than before.

600
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.790
And all my hate was engulfed
in its flames.


601
01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.303
But sooner or later,

602
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:09.702
love withers in these terrible games,
doesn't it?


603
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.504
It falls, mutilated
in the battle of two hearts.


604
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.103
It gets back up for a short time,

605
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.424
only to fall

606
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.502
even more mutilated...

607
01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.387
Then we no longer love each other?

608
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.868
My poor child,

609
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.143
we both know
we no longer love each other.


610
01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.900
It is written on your brow.

611
01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.742
Boredom overwhelms you.

612
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:55.062
You're not a weak creature
who deludes herself.


613
01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.708
Let us separate.

614
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.703
It's the only way to end this nobly.

615
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.982
Go on, I'm enthralled.

616
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.941
I told her that we'd stay friends,

617
01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.909
and I proved it to her.

618
01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.267
We spent even more time together,

619
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.707
now that we'd separated.

620
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.902
I took her to the theater,

621
01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.141
I went riding with her.

622
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.103
My elegant friends

623
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.151
who dumped their mistresses
when they were through with them,


624
01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.750
made fun of me

625
01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.060
and our supposed
sentimental separation.


626
01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.588
My dear man, they'd say,
you'll never be rid of that woman -


627
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.424
you still love her.

628
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.586
Marquise, I was sure of the opposite.

629
01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.588
I'd returned to my bachelor life
with such total joy


630
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.829
to have any doubts
about my control of myself.


631
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.709
Vellini agreed
we no longer loved each other,


632
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.907
and stuck her claws into Cerisy.

633
01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:13.668
So it was your Malaguena
who mined that poor devil Cerisy?


634
01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.904
I'm not painting a rosy picture of her.

635
01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.586
I'm speaking frankly to you.

636
01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.301
Anyone else but you
would protest loudly,


637
01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.021
and deny one could wreck one's life
for that creature.


638
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.781
My child.

639
01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:34.184
We weren't as narrow-minded
in the 18th century as in this one.


640
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.781
And, believe me,
I've remained ferociously 18th century.


641
01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.711
It's you, Ryno.

642
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.704
You didn't expect me?

643
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.670
My God, you're burning,

644
01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.747
- You have a fever?
- I don't know,


645
01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.149
but I'm bored.

646
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.223
Maybe this Spanish sunshine
makes you homesick.


647
01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.185
Well...

648
01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.149
You may be right.

649
01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.627
You're still the same Vellini.

650
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.621
The wild woman
who no one can stand up to.


651
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.548
Life is standing up to me.

652
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.621
I don't know what's wrong,

653
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.464
but I'm suffering.

654
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.184
I was happier with you, Ryno.

655
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.350
Does Cerisy upset you, my poor girl?

656
01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.186
Him?

657
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.911
You know about him? 
They told you?

658
01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.631
No he doesn't upset me, the poor man.

659
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.827
He wouldn't dare.

660
01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.420
He is subservient,

661
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.990
paralyzed,

662
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:23.540
totally devoted to me.

663
01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.468
Only, it bores me.

664
01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.145
I preferred life when you detected me.

665
01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.071
And you, are you happy?

666
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.704
What if I'm not?

667
01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.182
Don't lie to me.

668
01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.181
You met a woman in London

669
01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.548
and returned with her to Paris.

670
01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.861
You came back together ten days ago.

671
01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.706
The woman you mention
is a noble Parisian.


672
01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.341
When you meet a compatriot abroad,
you link up easily,


673
01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.108
and without consequences.

674
01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.141
And she was traveling with her husband.

675
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.621
You're not in love with her?

676
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.465
Weren't you two at the opera last night?

677
01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.822
You were, Ryno.

678
01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.621
I saw you there.

679
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:30.343
But you were so immersed
in your new mistress,


680
01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.990
you never saw me.

681
01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.028
What if it's true?

682
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.581
She's the first woman I've loved
since our split.


683
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.988
Why do you adopt that tone?

684
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.948
I know it's wrong.

685
01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.782
Why do you insist
on stopping to love me?


686
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:06.506
Not loving is the worst misfortune.

687
01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.743
Why won't you answer?

688
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.062
You made me suffer too much.

689
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.868
I can't go back to that.

690
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.505
But you like to come back here

691
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.902
when it suits you,
as much as it suits you,


692
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:34.065
nose in the air,
hands in your pockets,


693
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.782
without any commitment.

694
01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.783
How very convenient...

695
01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.462
Whereas with...

696
01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.862
your Countess...

697
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.625
Countess who?

698
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.065
Countess de Mendoze.

699
01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.824
Stop that.

700
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.987
Or I'll never come here again.

701
01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:59.462
So what? You think I still love you?

702
01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.390
What do I care about you
and your Countess de Mendoza?


703
01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.501
You don't believe me?

704
01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.663
Then put your hand on my heart

705
01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.142
and tell me of your joy
with your new mistress.


706
01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.430
If your heart beats faster, spurn me.

707
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.187
Tell me how she makes love.

708
01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.743
She's a noble lady,

709
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.065
incredibly cold and prudish.

710
01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:36.030
Repelled by the base acts of love.

711
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.303
She finally gave in to me
in a flood of tears,


712
01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.181
as if she despised herself,

713
01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.786
but her love was too strong...

714
01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.787
She doesn't open her legs,

715
01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.541
she clenches them.

716
01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:56.746
Do you like that?

717
01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.902
I almost force her.

718
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.462
She closes her eyes,
refuses to look at me.


719
01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.945
And she weeps.
It is very impressive.


720
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.628
How does she come?

721
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.588
That's not the point.

722
01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.308
I doubt she gets any pleasure.

723
01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:19.581
Her surrender,
her sacrifice is what's sublime.


724
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.227
It flatters your tiny pride.

725
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.027
But that's not love...

726
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.791
Most women

727
01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.864
refuse to know what it is

728
01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.507
to give oneself to a man.

729
01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.500
What it is to hold a man

730
01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.504
in one's belly.

731
01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.429
What do you find
so extraordinary about her?


732
01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:01.470
You, above all.

733
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.828
I don't understand...

734
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.306
If at least you'd replaced me

735
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:13.028
with someone
a hundred times more gifted


736
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.784
at pleasuring you...

737
01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.101
You'd be desperately jealous.

738
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.869
Perhaps.

739
01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.587
But at least not humiliated.

740
01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.588
Does her title excite you?

741
01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.862
Be quiet.
She's a great lady.


742
01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.705
If you knew her, you'd keep quiet.

743
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.350
She's way above you.

744
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.790
It's light.

745
01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.030
I've exhausted you.

746
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.229
My young friend,
one doesn't need sleep at my age.


747
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.509
I spent many a sleepless night
in my youth.


748
01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:28.625
Fireside chats
are the ballroom follies of old age.


749
01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.067
And now I know everything

750
01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.950
about the husband
I chose for Hermangarde.


751
01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:39.625
You gave me the self-assurance I lacked.

752
01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.187
You trusted me
when they all scorned Ryno de Marigny.


753
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:49.070
My own family
never understood who I was,


754
01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.427
or what I could become.

755
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:55.825
Thank you.

756
01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.461
You're my real mother.

757
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.030
I love you like a son...

758
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.501
I never felt that for my mother.

759
01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.823
- I love Hermangarde more than anything.
- I know.


760
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.631
My granddaughter
is my greatest treasure.


761
01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:19.068
I'm glad
I didn't oppose your happiness,


762
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.268
or Hermangarde's.

763
01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:50.466
He had the nerve
to tell her his whole story,


764
01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.861
he reveled in it.

765
01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.906
My dear, as I always said,

766
01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:01.020
it's the perverse influence
of over-provocative novels


767
01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.626
on female common sense.

768
01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.387
Here's the text chosen
by the bride and groom,


769
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.066
from the Gospel according to St Matthew -

770
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.111
"Some Pharisees came to Jesus
and tested him, saying,


771
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:54.502
May a man divorce his wife
for any use he pleases?


772
01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.982
He answered,
Have you not read, that the Creator


773
01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.189
made them male and female and said,

774
01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.422
A man leaves his father and mother,

775
01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.504
to be united to his wife
and become one flesh.


776
01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.787
They are no longer two,
but one flesh.


777
01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:13.384
What God has united,
let not man separate.


778
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:19.909
They objected, 'Why did Moses say
a man may divorce his wife with a letter?'


779
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:24.668
He said to them, 'Your stubbornness is why
Moses let you divorce your wives.'


780
01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.220
But in the beginning it was not so.

781
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.463
A man may only divorce his wife
for unchastity.


782
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.828
If he marries another, it is adultery.

783
01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.027
Some disciples said,
'If it is so for a man and his wife,


784
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.182
it is best not to many.'

785
01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:44.231
He said to them, 'Only those
God appointed can accept this.'


786
01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:48.469
Some men are born eunuchs
from their mothers womb.


787
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.430
Others were made so by men.

788
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:55.266
Others became eunuchs
for the Kingdom of Heaven.


789
01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.547
Let those accept it who can."

790
01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:02.983
"Imitate me, as I imitate Christ.

791
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.507
But know that Christ
is the head of all men,


792
01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:11.188
as a husband is the head of his wife,
and God the head of Christ.


793
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.469
Any man who prays
with his head covered


794
01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.668
brings shame upon his head.

795
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:20.461
Any woman who prays
with her head unveiled


796
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.306
brings shame on her head,
as if it had been shaved.


797
01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:28.226
A woman who is unveiled,
is as if shorn.


798
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.463
If it is shameful
for her to be shorn,


799
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.190
she should wear a veil.

800
01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.308
A man must not cover his head,

801
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.111
for he is the
image and glory of God,

802
01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.547
but woman is the glory of man.

803
01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:44.067
Man did not come from woman,
but woman from man.


804
01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:49.427
Man was not created for woman,
but woman for man.


805
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:53.869
A woman must have
a sign of authority on her head,


806
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.022
out of regard for the angels."

807
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.910
Epistle of St Paul to the Corinthians.

808
01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.585
How the sea rises.

809
01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.665
The spring tide.
Monsieur de Marigny will have forgotten.


810
01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.187
If they are too tardy,
how will they get back?


811
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.422
You're still not concerned?

812
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.548
I hope they don't catch cold.

813
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.667
Did you do as I did, Marquise?

814
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.825
You wrote to someone?
I see a letter in your hands.


815
01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.267
To whom would I write, my dear?

816
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.662
To Viscount de Prony, like you,
to admonish him.


817
01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.947
This letter you see

818
01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.068
is neither from me, nor to me.

819
01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.508
It's for Monsieur de Marigny,
and was just handed to me.


820
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.544
- Is it from Paris?
- Yes, it is.


821
01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.982
You know this handwriting?

822
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:55.105
Marquise, what an awful scribble.

823
01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.831
I know no one who writes like that.

824
01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.630
It's a woman's handwriting.

825
01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:03.420
A washer woman's.

826
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.583
Washerwomen don't fold
their letters like this,


827
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.630
or possess seals like this one. Look

828
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.744
My God.

829
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.781
Could it be that his old mistress,

830
01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:24.422
who has been silent until now,
has changed her mind?


831
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.104
It would seem likely.

832
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:30.265
She lay low for four months
and now springs back to life.


833
01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.990
Quite astute of her.

834
01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.824
She thinks by now

835
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.790
the joy of a lovely young wife
has worn off.


836
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:38.945
A big mistake.

837
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:43.264
He's still deeply in love with his wife,
she's wasting her time.


838
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.469
Coming from you,
this confidence reassures me.


839
01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:49.350
Yes, be reassured.

840
01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:53.220
Let's both be reassured.
What's a letter after all?


841
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.623
There they are.

842
01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.590
We were caught by the tide.
We came back by boat.


843
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.982
You're soaked.
Get warm by the fire.


844
01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.825
If you fall ill,
where will we be then.


845
01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:10.991
I'm not cold.

846
01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.028
I have to get used to the breeze,

847
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.831
now I'm the wife of a man
who loves the sea.


848
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.144
Monsieur de Marigny,
I was given a letter for you from Paris.


849
01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:23.341
Thank you.

850
01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:20.831
Why did you come here?

851
01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.146
Because it pleased me to.

852
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.781
Isn't the open air
as much mine as anyone?


853
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.262
I came here

854
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.549
because I was bored
with not seeing you,


855
01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:39.869
because you didn't reply to my letters.

856
01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.386
Why did you pursue me here?

857
01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.342
If I feel like living on these shores,

858
01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.424
spending my days on this cliff...

859
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.186
Doesn't it all belong to me
as much as to you?


860
01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.262
What are you afraid of?

861
01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:04.305
Deep down you're unsure of yourself.

862
01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.188
I like this place,

863
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.308
and I want to live here.

864
01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:15.384
If I'm not wanted, go away.

865
01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:19.906
As for me,
I'm taking possession of it today.


866
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.744
It could be said
that I came here like a beggar,


867
01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.461
to plead for a glance
from the sovereign,


868
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.591
who...

869
01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.270
banished me...

870
01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.469
If I betrayed the love of my life,
I'd hate myself.


871
01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.622
So would you...

872
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.787
If you refuse to put your arms

873
01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:55.431
for a minute around your Malaguena,

874
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.502
you'd better kill me.

875
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.591
At least then I'd feel no more pain.

876
01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.230
What are you waiting for?

877
01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:07.671
We're alone up here.

878
01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.269
See, there's no one.

879
01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.820
Take up your gun.

880
01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.071
You see...

881
01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:22.466
If anyone hears,
you missed a seagull.


882
01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.631
If I fall into the sea,

883
01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:31.022
you'll be sure to be faithful. Shoot.

884
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.025
You're mad.

885
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.425
Not now.

886
01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.310
She's asleep.

887
01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.511
Be good.

888
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.390
One kiss.

889
01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:54.430
One kiss first.

890
01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.545
A real one.

891
01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.461
Weren't you going to
take the dogs out?


892
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.184
Did Ryno wake you, Grandmother?

893
01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:40.868
No, my child, your husband
did not wake me. I wasn't asleep.


894
01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.068
Are you really leaving us?

895
01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.790
Winter is coming.

896
01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:51.466
Dampness doesn't agree with rheumatism.

897
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.622
I love this place, 
I'm happy here.

898
01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:58.101
But I love you more than any place.

899
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.471
If I ask him,
Ryno will return to Paris.


900
01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.304
Make sure you don't.

901
01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.348
You don't yet know, my sweet,

902
01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:08.787
how fragile is a woman's happiness.

903
01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.988
Ryno idolizes you.

904
01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.108
Here, what would he love,
if not you?


905
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.750
But in Paris.

906
01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.629
There are so many distractions,

907
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:21.467
and for a woman who is loved,
every distraction is a mortal enemy.


908
01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.387
You're right, Grandmother.

909
01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.067
No woman owns the key
to a man's heart for long.


910
01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:33.460
But if you miss us, send word,
and we'll return to Paris.


911
01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:44.185
There's no handsomer couple
in all Paris.


912
01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.910
Ryno.

913
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.228
Not so fast.

914
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.427
I didn't realize
you weren't following.


915
01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.704
I'm so silly.

916
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:44.149
- Well, doctor?
- Madame de Marigny is pregnant.


917
01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:00.504
As of now,
I forbid you to get on a horse.


918
01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.265
Do you realize.

919
01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.707
When I think of it,
I break into a cold sweat...


920
01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.624
It's my son.

921
01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:22.308
Madame may catch cold.

922
01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.789
It is unwise in your state.

923
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:26.624
It's lovely weather.

924
01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.668
I need fresh air.

925
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.822
Keep covered,
the weather changes fast here.


926
01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:52.861
I'm a grown woman.

927
01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:01.701
Why, it's the lady of the manor,
the Marquise's daughter.


928
01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:08.910
Old Griffon.

929
01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:14.502
Who's that woman
sitting on a pile of ropes?


930
01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.110
You don't know her?

931
01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.148
Everyone around here knows her now.

932
01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:21.860
Often,

933
01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.748
she comes fishing with us.

934
01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.308
You're even handsomer
than when I first saw you.


935
01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:20.826
And now we're reunited.

936
01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.186
Be quiet.

937
01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:16.470
Talk, if you want...

938
01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:20.430
Say what you want.

939
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:24.827
It's only too true that I came.

940
01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:35.988
As God is my witness,

941
01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:39.342
you're the cause of more kisses,

942
01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.264
of more tenderness for Hermangarde

943
01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:45.946
than I'd have given her
if you hadn't existed.


944
01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:54.228
I kissed her

945
01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:59.182
like a drowning man
clings to a floating log.


946
01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:17.182
They say that in battle,

947
01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:21.226
when thoroughbred horses
are lightly injured


948
01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.268
by a bayonet.

949
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:30.185
A mysterious attraction for pain

950
01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.105
urges them forward
to impale themselves


951
01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:37.506
right to the heart.

952
01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.022
It's the same with you,

953
01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.821
since the day I saw you again.

954
01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:32.230
Is that my horse?

955
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.384
It's just the wind.

956
01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.861
Don't leave me.

957
01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.704
It's the wind.

958
01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:07.784
It's the wind.

959
01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.421
It can't be her.

960
01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:49.666
You see, there's no one.

961
01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.504
Come back inside.

962
01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.464
Rebuke me.

963
01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:16.667
Tell me what you're thinking.

964
01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.828
You're worrying for nothing.

965
01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:28.268
Everything is fine.

966
01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.587
The worst is this silence.

967
01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:09.783
In fact, no.

968
01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:11.828
I was thinking of
Countess de Mendoze.


969
01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:17.148
You knew she died?

970
01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:27.541
Is she happier where she is now?

971
01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:35.271
You mean I kill everyone close to me.

972
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.982
I didn't say that.

973
01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:53.540
There's something terrible in my fate.

974
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.344
I always knew it.

975
01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:20.469
After a year and a half of uncertainty,
I have just now


976
01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.861
received the proof of something

977
01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.547
I had calculated and foreseen,

978
01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:29.430
as one calculates an eclipse.

979
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.424
In fact, it is also an eclipse.

980
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:36.630
That paragon of husbands,
Monsieur de Marigny...


981
01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.270
Monsieur de Marigny?

982
01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.342
...Has done like the dog in the Bible.

983
01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:43.663
He has returned...
you know where?


984
01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:47.221
What you're saying is most unsavory.

985
01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.950
Saying isn't doing.

986
01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:52.820
Let's see...
It's ten o'clock exactly.


987
01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.746
Where do you think
Monsieur de Marigny is now?


988
01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:01.707
That genius of conjugal love.

989
01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.191
My God.

990
01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:08.390
So my poor friend the Marquise de Flers
did well to die.


991
01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:13.068
He's at 46 rue des Cannes,

992
01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:14.790
at Senora Vellini's.

993
01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:16.510
Are you sure of this?

994
01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:20.027
He was at the opera last night
with his wife.


995
01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:23.547
He left around the same time I did...

996
01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:27.022
I saw him get into his carriage
under the arches.


997
01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.421
It was after Act Two.

998
01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:32.185
He left Madame de Marigny in her box,

999
01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:35.742
with Madame de Spaur
and Madame de Vanvres.


1000
01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:38.585
What proves he went to Rue de Cannes?

1001
01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.867
I saw him enter her house myself.

1002
01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:45.911
His carriage parked in front of the door

1003
01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:50.508
testified to the fact
to anyone who passed by.


1004
01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:53.225
Monsieur de Marigny

1005
01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:56.270
does not like secrecy.

1006
01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.581
What I like about him is that,

1007
01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:02.708
if one day he's a government minister,

1008
01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:06.182
he'll revel in being unpopular.

1009
01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:09.228
I know of no man who defies

1010
01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:11.064
opinion better than he.

1011
01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:12.710
Just like a man.

1012
01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:17.067
And You needn't believe me,
Monsieur de Prony,


1013
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:21.341
but I swear he was madly in love
with Hermangarde.


1014
01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.787
I witnessed that love,
and I'll never forget it.


1015
01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:28.431
That's just as well, Countess.

1016
01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.662
That way,
at least someone will remember.


1017
01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:35.470
For he probably no longer does.
