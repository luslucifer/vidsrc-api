<i>If you must blink, do it now.</i>

2
00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:46.552
<i>Pay careful attention</i>
<i>to everything you see</i>

3
00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:51.523
<i>No matter how unusual</i>

4
00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:33.532
<i>And please be warned:</i>
<i>If you fidget,</i>


5
00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:35.534
<i>if you look away,</i>

6
00:01:35.536 --> 00:01:38.837

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:40.806

8
00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:45.277
<i>Then our hero</i>
<i>will surely perish.</i>


9
00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:27.819
<i>His name is kubo.</i>

10
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:30.889
<i>His grandfather</i>
<i>stole something from him.</i>


11
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:44.002
<i>And that really is</i>
<i>the least of it.</i>


12
00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:46.765
Ow!

13
00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:15.874
Well, hello, kubo!

14
00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:19.110
How is it today?
Wasn't a bad crowd.


15
00:07:19.112 --> 00:07:21.546
I got two pennies
and a lint ball.


16
00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:23.448
This is pretty good lint.

17
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.584
And what have you
got planned for today?


18
00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:27.419
Aw, you know.
The usual.


19
00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:29.087
Monsters?
Of course.


20
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:31.523
You think you can work in
a fire-breathing chicken?


21
00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:33.692
The chicken again?

22
00:07:33.694 --> 00:07:35.527
The chicken is funny.

23
00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:38.463
A touch of comedy
to balance the whole thing out.


24
00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:41.800
They're gonna be
throwing money at you.
I just know it.


25
00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:43.802
Or they'll throw
something at you.
I don't know.


26
00:07:43.804 --> 00:07:46.237
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.


27
00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:49.541
And do you plan on finishing
the story this time, young man?


28
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.555
If you must blink, do it now.

29
00:08:12.966 --> 00:08:16.835
Pay careful attention
to everything you see and hear,


30
00:08:16.837 --> 00:08:19.104
no matter how unusual
it may seem.


31
00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:21.239
And please be warned:

32
00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:24.242
If you fidget,
if you look away,


33
00:08:24.244 --> 00:08:26.845
if you forget any part
of what I tell you,


34
00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:28.947
even for an instant,

35
00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:31.583
then our hero
will surely perish.


36
00:08:37.524 --> 00:08:39.791
Hanzo was a mighty samurai.

37
00:08:39.793 --> 00:08:41.426
But he was alone.

38
00:08:41.428 --> 00:08:43.428
His family taken from him,

39
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.330
his kingdom in ruins,

40
00:08:45.332 --> 00:08:49.334
and his army destroyed
by the dreaded moon king.


41
00:08:49.336 --> 00:08:53.004
You may recall,
hanzo was roaming
the distant far lands


42
00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:55.340
in search of
a magical suit of armor--


43
00:08:55.342 --> 00:08:57.375
the only weapon
in the whole world


44
00:08:57.377 --> 00:09:00.045
that could protect him
from the power
of the moon king.


45
00:09:00.047 --> 00:09:03.214
This armor was made up
of three pieces.


46
00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:05.483
The first--
ooh! I know, I know!


47
00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:07.686
The sword unbreakable!

48
00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:13.458
The second?

49
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.027
The breastplate impenaput--

50
00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:18.563
impenetrable.
Impen-a-truh-bubble!


51
00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:25.336
And finally,
the third weapon,


52
00:09:25.338 --> 00:09:27.706
the final piece of the armor--
i know this one.


53
00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:31.476
Pick me.
The helmet invulnerable!


54
00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:36.047
Before hanzo
could claim the armor


55
00:09:36.049 --> 00:09:39.317
and unite the pieces
to reveal their true power,


56
00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:42.420
he was attacked
by the moon king's beasts.


57
00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:58.403
Whoa!

58
00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:15.353
Oh, yes!

59
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.675
Kill the chicken!
Rip it to pieces!


60
00:11:06.138 --> 00:11:08.106
Oh, my!

61
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.460
Hanzo was filled with rage,

62
00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:33.231
his soul tormented by the grief
of a family stolen from him.


63
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:41.973
At last, our hero
was face-to-face


64
00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:44.375
with his Nemesis,
the moon king!


65
00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:49.614
Aah!

66
00:11:56.789 --> 00:11:58.489
So be sure
to come back tomorrow!


67
00:11:58.491 --> 00:12:00.158
Wh-what?

68
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.828
Oh, come on!
People like an ending.


69
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.064
Where are you going?

70
00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:09.234
No, you-- you can't--
you can't leave!


71
00:12:26.552 --> 00:12:30.588
Kubo... kubo...

72
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.925
Yes, mother.
I'm here.


73
00:12:35.662 --> 00:12:38.029
Hungry?

74
00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:41.332
And even though
he could barely see


75
00:12:41.334 --> 00:12:43.902
his own hand
in front of his face,


76
00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:46.938
hanzo and his army
of loyal samurai


77
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.007
pressed on
through the blizzard.


78
00:12:52.245 --> 00:12:56.080
And suddenly,
as quickly as it had started,


79
00:12:56.082 --> 00:12:58.783
the storm cleared before him.

80
00:12:58.785 --> 00:13:03.054
Hanzo breathed a sigh of relief,
for he was home.


81
00:13:03.056 --> 00:13:05.556
His fortress?
The beetle clan castle!


82
00:13:05.558 --> 00:13:08.359
Yes. At the very edge
of the far lands,


83
00:13:08.361 --> 00:13:11.429
hidden from the moon king
by powerful magic.


84
00:13:11.431 --> 00:13:14.265
And then what happened?
When he got to the castle?


85
00:13:16.068 --> 00:13:18.937
When who got to the castle?
Hanzo, my father.


86
00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:22.941
Hanzo--
hanzo was at the castle?


87
00:13:22.943 --> 00:13:25.410
He...

88
00:13:25.412 --> 00:13:28.246
Just give me a second.
I am...


89
00:13:28.248 --> 00:13:30.448
No, no, no.

90
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.451
It's gone.
I can't...


91
00:13:33.453 --> 00:13:36.587
Um... I'm sorry, kubo.

92
00:13:36.589 --> 00:13:40.892
Perhaps I c-- I could recall
a different story.


93
00:13:40.894 --> 00:13:44.629
Mother, what was father like?

94
00:13:46.265 --> 00:13:49.600
Oh, this one is easy.

95
00:13:49.602 --> 00:13:53.905
Hanzo was a mighty warrior,
skilled with sword and bow--


96
00:13:53.907 --> 00:13:57.075
no. What was he really like?

97
00:13:57.077 --> 00:14:00.745
When he wasn't fighting.
When he was with us.


98
00:14:00.747 --> 00:14:05.450
He was just like you.

99
00:14:05.452 --> 00:14:07.752
Like me?
Yes.


100
00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:13.491
Strong and clever and funny
and, oh, so handsome.


101
00:14:13.493 --> 00:14:15.126
Ugh! Mother!

102
00:14:15.128 --> 00:14:17.695
Come on!

103
00:14:17.697 --> 00:14:22.133
Never forget how much
he loved you, kubo.


104
00:14:22.135 --> 00:14:25.069
He died protecting us.

105
00:14:27.373 --> 00:14:30.641
Did the moon king--
uh-- your grandfather.


106
00:14:30.643 --> 00:14:34.278
Did grandfather
and your sisters
really kill my father?


107
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.215
It can't be true, can it?
They're family.


108
00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:39.217
No, they are monsters!

109
00:14:39.219 --> 00:14:42.553
Grandfather and my sisters
stole your eye, kubo.


110
00:14:42.555 --> 00:14:45.456
They must never
find you again. Never!


111
00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:47.992
You must always stay hidden
from the night sky,


112
00:14:47.994 --> 00:14:51.029
or they will find you,
and they'll take you
away from me.


113
00:14:51.031 --> 00:14:54.198
Promise me
you will never let this happen.


114
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.268
Promise me, kubo.

115
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.009
Don't be sad, kubo.

116
00:15:05.011 --> 00:15:09.881
Kubo, remember what
you must do, kubo.


117
00:15:09.883 --> 00:15:12.583
Remember?

118
00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:15.053
Keep you with me at all times,
Mr. monkey.


119
00:15:15.055 --> 00:15:17.221
A-a-a-and?
And...


120
00:15:17.223 --> 00:15:21.059
Keep father's robe
on my back at all times.


121
00:15:21.061 --> 00:15:23.327
Yes, kubo.

122
00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:25.430
And there's one more thing.

123
00:15:25.432 --> 00:15:28.533
Never, ever

124
00:15:28.535 --> 00:15:31.736
stay out after dark.

125
00:15:31.738 --> 00:15:34.839
Huh? Re-mem-ber.

126
00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:37.442
Yes, Mr. monkey.

127
00:15:37.444 --> 00:15:40.011
Good boy.

128
00:15:57.963 --> 00:15:59.430
Bedtime.

129
00:16:54.187 --> 00:16:57.488
Mother, wake up.
You're dreaming.


130
00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.790
No. Kubo...

131
00:16:59.792 --> 00:17:01.692
Kubo, is that you?

132
00:17:01.694 --> 00:17:04.028
Yes, mother.
I'm here.


133
00:17:07.366 --> 00:17:10.368
Kubo, what happened
to your eye?


134
00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:35.993
Paper boy! Here! Here!

135
00:17:35.995 --> 00:17:38.196
Come on. Come on.

136
00:17:38.198 --> 00:17:41.799
Come sit next to me.
I got us a good spot here.


137
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:46.370
What do you think?
I got myself all spruced up
for the big day.


138
00:17:48.908 --> 00:17:50.875
Mmm...

139
00:17:50.877 --> 00:17:53.311
I do so love the festival.

140
00:17:56.883 --> 00:18:00.484
You know, it's a shame
you never stay past sundown.


141
00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:03.654
There's fireworks
and singing and dancing


142
00:18:03.656 --> 00:18:06.257
and feasting, of course.

143
00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:08.526
But the best part of all--

144
00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:10.995
do you see those lamps
and altars?


145
00:18:10.997 --> 00:18:16.701
We use those
to speak to the loved ones
that left us behind.


146
00:18:16.703 --> 00:18:21.205
We listen to their tales
and guide their safe return


147
00:18:21.207 --> 00:18:23.040
to the blissful pure land.

148
00:18:23.042 --> 00:18:25.109
Really?
Did you speak to someone?


149
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:26.877
Yes, I did. My husband.

150
00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:30.081
His voice was
as clear and loud


151
00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:33.084
as the one you use
for your stories.


152
00:18:33.086 --> 00:18:35.586
In 72 years,
he never had a thing to say.


153
00:18:35.588 --> 00:18:38.089
Now he's gone,
i can't shut him up.


154
00:18:41.928 --> 00:18:45.129
You have someone
you want to talk to, huh?
Very much.


155
00:18:45.131 --> 00:18:48.366
Well, what's stopping you?
Don't I need a lamp?


156
00:18:48.368 --> 00:18:52.970
Well, I'll bet you could make
a really nice one


157
00:18:52.972 --> 00:18:57.375
with that paper-folding
thing you do.


158
00:18:57.377 --> 00:18:59.777
You see? Not just
a pretty face, huh?


159
00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:02.079
Now hurry along.

160
00:19:02.081 --> 00:19:05.316
Go! There's still time
before dark.


161
00:19:05.318 --> 00:19:07.051
Go! Get out of here.

162
00:19:40.585 --> 00:19:43.521
Place the lamp
at the altar.


163
00:19:43.523 --> 00:19:45.323
Very good.

164
00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:47.325
What do we do next, daddy?

165
00:19:47.327 --> 00:19:48.959
Now we pray.

166
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:52.296
We ask her spirit
to honor us with its light.


167
00:19:52.298 --> 00:19:54.298
Grandma, will you please honor--
shh!


168
00:19:56.102 --> 00:19:58.769
Softly. Softly.

169
00:20:16.154 --> 00:20:19.290
Hello, father.
I hope you're well.


170
00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:21.292
I mean,
i know you're dead,


171
00:20:21.294 --> 00:20:25.129
but I hope everything
is... okay.


172
00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:32.570
Look. It's your robe.

173
00:20:32.572 --> 00:20:36.073
Mother says I'll grow into it.

174
00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:39.877
She says you were a great leader
who died protecting me,


175
00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:42.513
saving one of my eyes.

176
00:20:42.515 --> 00:20:46.117
Two would have been ideal,
but thanks anyway.


177
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.689
Father, I'm worried
about mother.


178
00:20:51.691 --> 00:20:55.393
With every day that goes by,
she drifts further away.


179
00:20:57.062 --> 00:20:59.430
She talks a lot
about you, but--


180
00:20:59.432 --> 00:21:01.532
but I just don't know.

181
00:21:01.534 --> 00:21:04.735
I don't think she remembers
what's real anymore.


182
00:21:04.737 --> 00:21:08.672
I don't know
what's real anymore.


183
00:21:08.674 --> 00:21:11.242
I just wish you were here,

184
00:21:11.244 --> 00:21:14.178
so I could--
i could talk to you,


185
00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.047
see you,
find out what I should do.


186
00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:20.117
Daddy! Daddy, she's here!
Grandma is here!


187
00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:22.720
Now it's time
for the final part.


188
00:21:22.722 --> 00:21:25.589
We have to help her get back
to the spirit world.


189
00:21:25.591 --> 00:21:28.225
But she just got here.

190
00:21:28.227 --> 00:21:31.061
Come on.

191
00:21:31.063 --> 00:21:34.098
Father? Hello?

192
00:21:37.769 --> 00:21:39.637
Anytime.

193
00:22:36.027 --> 00:22:37.995
Fine!

194
00:22:37.997 --> 00:22:41.432
I don't need you anyway.

195
00:22:46.004 --> 00:22:48.172
Kubo!

196
00:22:57.015 --> 00:23:00.184
I'm sorry.

197
00:23:07.025 --> 00:23:10.561
Kubo...

198
00:23:15.368 --> 00:23:17.968
Kubo.

199
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.740
Little boy,
what happened to your eye?


200
00:23:22.742 --> 00:23:26.210
Who are you?
How-- how do you know my name?


201
00:23:26.212 --> 00:23:29.547
We're your family, kubo.

202
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:32.149
Your mother's sisters.

203
00:23:32.151 --> 00:23:35.920
And we've been looking for you
for so long.


204
00:23:35.922 --> 00:23:40.858
It's so lovely
to meet you, kubo,


205
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.227
face-to-face.

206
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:48.098
Come, kubo.

207
00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.501
Come to your aunties.

208
00:23:50.503 --> 00:23:54.605
No reason
to be afraid, kubo.


209
00:23:54.607 --> 00:23:56.941
We just need
your other eye.


210
00:23:56.943 --> 00:24:00.244
Your grandfather
admires it so.


211
00:24:24.537 --> 00:24:27.304
Help! Help!

212
00:24:27.306 --> 00:24:29.907
Somebody help! Help!

213
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:31.909
Look out! Run!

214
00:24:56.735 --> 00:24:59.803
We're here, kubo.

215
00:24:59.805 --> 00:25:02.473
Your family has come for you.

216
00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:16.186
Kubo!

217
00:25:16.188 --> 00:25:17.655
Mother!

218
00:25:23.862 --> 00:25:26.764
Kubo, you must
find the armor.


219
00:25:26.766 --> 00:25:28.832
It's your only chance.

220
00:25:28.834 --> 00:25:30.367
Remember this!

221
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.709
Mother!

222
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:40.811
Aah! Mother!

223
00:25:40.813 --> 00:25:42.246
No!

224
00:25:44.482 --> 00:25:45.616
Mother!

225
00:25:59.497 --> 00:26:02.332
Kubo.

226
00:26:02.334 --> 00:26:05.402
Kubo!

227
00:26:05.404 --> 00:26:08.205
Can you hear me, kubo?

228
00:26:12.477 --> 00:26:14.978
I said your mother is gone.

229
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.981
Your village is destroyed,
burned to the ground.


230
00:26:17.983 --> 00:26:21.018
We landed here
in the far lands.


231
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.020
Your enemies
aren't far behind.


232
00:26:23.022 --> 00:26:27.758
We must search for shelter
before your grandfather comes.


233
00:26:33.164 --> 00:26:35.733
We need to go now.

234
00:26:37.001 --> 00:26:39.470
Come on. Get up.
Let's go.


235
00:27:16.274 --> 00:27:18.876
Once we're inside,
you might be tempted


236
00:27:18.878 --> 00:27:21.378
to complain about the odor.

237
00:27:24.883 --> 00:27:27.618
Keep in mind
my sense of smell


238
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.954
is ten times stronger
than yours.


239
00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:10.093
You have questions,
i can tell.


240
00:28:10.095 --> 00:28:12.229
Who--
you get three.


241
00:28:13.598 --> 00:28:15.666
I think I have more.

242
00:28:15.668 --> 00:28:18.368
Three. But first
you're gonna eat.


243
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.638
Why only three?
Okay, that was
your first question.


244
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.175
What? I don't understand
what's happening. Who are you?


245
00:28:25.177 --> 00:28:27.744
You don't recognize me.

246
00:28:31.649 --> 00:28:34.618
All these years,
you had to keep me
in your pack.


247
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.721
Well, now you know why.
But you were a wooden charm.


248
00:28:37.723 --> 00:28:40.657
You were this big.

249
00:28:40.659 --> 00:28:43.994
I called that charm Mr. monkey.

250
00:28:43.996 --> 00:28:46.864
And if I were alive
at that point,
i might've found that insulting.


251
00:28:46.866 --> 00:28:50.634
Look, your mother used
the last of her magic
to save you


252
00:28:50.636 --> 00:28:52.236
and bring me to life.

253
00:29:03.014 --> 00:29:04.815
Here. Drink.

254
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.185
Ugh!

255
00:29:08.187 --> 00:29:10.087
Smells.

256
00:29:10.089 --> 00:29:12.923
Everything in here smells.
Drink it.


257
00:29:12.925 --> 00:29:15.993
I don't want it.
I said, "drink it."


258
00:29:15.995 --> 00:29:17.828
You're a mean monkey,
aren't you?


259
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.364
Yes. Yes, I am.
And that's three.


260
00:29:20.366 --> 00:29:22.366
You're out of questions now,
so just listen.


261
00:29:22.368 --> 00:29:24.368
I'm here to protect you, kubo,

262
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.904
and that means
you have to do as I say.


263
00:29:26.906 --> 00:29:29.373
So, if you don't eat,
you'll be weak.


264
00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:31.008
If you're weak,
you'll be slow.


265
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.277
If you're slow, you'll die.

266
00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:39.783
It's too hot!

267
00:29:46.191 --> 00:29:47.524
Drink.

268
00:29:55.434 --> 00:29:58.368
Oh, excuse me.

269
00:30:11.582 --> 00:30:14.151
Okay, you better start
taking this seriously, kubo.


270
00:30:14.153 --> 00:30:16.753
This is real.
This is not a story.


271
00:30:16.755 --> 00:30:20.724
Those things, your aunts--
they never get hungry.


272
00:30:20.726 --> 00:30:24.594
They never sleep.
They will find you.


273
00:30:24.596 --> 00:30:28.231
And if we're not prepared,
they'll kill me,


274
00:30:28.233 --> 00:30:31.068
and take your other eye.

275
00:30:33.838 --> 00:30:35.672
What are we gonna do?

276
00:30:35.674 --> 00:30:38.308
We're going to find the armor.

277
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.777
It's the only thing
that can protect you.


278
00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:44.348
So it's real.
Really real.


279
00:30:56.761 --> 00:30:59.062
Don't worry.
I'm not going to keep it.


280
00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:04.835
I pulled that from her head.
I didn't mean to.


281
00:31:04.837 --> 00:31:07.671
Your mother
was very powerful.


282
00:31:07.673 --> 00:31:10.707
She blessed your robes
so that when the need was most,


283
00:31:10.709 --> 00:31:12.709
they would fly you away.

284
00:31:12.711 --> 00:31:16.013
She used the last of that power
to bring me to life.


285
00:31:16.015 --> 00:31:19.483
This bracelet, her hair--
it's a memory.


286
00:31:19.485 --> 00:31:22.219
And memories
are powerful things, kubo.


287
00:31:22.221 --> 00:31:24.221
Never lose it.

288
00:31:28.292 --> 00:31:30.127
One more question?

289
00:31:30.129 --> 00:31:32.129
Last one.

290
00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:35.966
Do you know where it is?
The armor?


291
00:31:35.968 --> 00:31:38.568
No. No, I don't.

292
00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:45.208
Now go to sleep.

293
00:31:52.817 --> 00:31:54.951
Good night, monkey.

294
00:32:12.503 --> 00:32:14.571
Kubo.

295
00:32:14.573 --> 00:32:18.041
Kubo, you were talking
in your sleep.


296
00:32:18.043 --> 00:32:22.112
You were dreaming,
calling out to your father.


297
00:32:22.114 --> 00:32:24.514
And-- and then the paper
flew out of your bag


298
00:32:24.516 --> 00:32:27.651
and folded itself into him.

299
00:32:30.121 --> 00:32:33.590
He's been standing there
for hours,


300
00:32:33.592 --> 00:32:35.759
quietly judging us.

301
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.965
I'm not even convinced
this counts as origami.


302
00:32:43.367 --> 00:32:46.570
I could swear
scissors were involved.


303
00:32:46.572 --> 00:32:48.572
Ow!

304
00:32:48.574 --> 00:32:52.409
Back home in the cave,
my mother's dreams did this,


305
00:32:52.411 --> 00:32:56.313
and the paper always
unfolded itself by morning.


306
00:33:06.124 --> 00:33:08.325
What's that about?

307
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.141
What are you doing?

308
00:33:29.147 --> 00:33:31.681
I guess this is how
my father answered me.


309
00:33:31.683 --> 00:33:34.951
Hmm. I'm tempted to say
that entrusting our fate


310
00:33:34.953 --> 00:33:38.088
to the guidance
of a small paper man


311
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.090
seems like a bad idea.

312
00:33:40.092 --> 00:33:44.261
But it's the best
bad idea we have.


313
00:35:04.842 --> 00:35:05.976
Aah!

314
00:35:13.518 --> 00:35:15.518
You're growing stronger.

315
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.954
You might not want to look
quite so pleased about that.


316
00:35:17.956 --> 00:35:20.190
We grow stronger,

317
00:35:20.192 --> 00:35:22.359
the world grows
more dangerous.


318
00:35:22.361 --> 00:35:24.694
Life has a funny way
of keeping things balanced.


319
00:35:24.696 --> 00:35:28.098
Monkey, do you ever say
anything encouraging?


320
00:35:29.367 --> 00:35:31.935
I encourage you not to die.

321
00:35:39.443 --> 00:35:42.112
"I encourage you not to die."

322
00:35:55.926 --> 00:35:56.993
Mm!

323
00:36:02.466 --> 00:36:05.302
Mosquitoes. Annoying.

324
00:36:28.592 --> 00:36:30.593
Wasn't me, I swear.

325
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.298
Paper runs out,
as does Patience.


326
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.900
I didn't ask them
to do that.


327
00:36:38.536 --> 00:36:40.203
The second time.

328
00:36:40.205 --> 00:36:41.971
I didn't!

329
00:36:41.973 --> 00:36:45.141
At least not exactly.
I mean, I felt it, but--


330
00:36:45.143 --> 00:36:47.210
magic is not meant
to be easy.


331
00:36:47.212 --> 00:36:49.179
You need to learn control.

332
00:36:49.181 --> 00:36:50.947
Concentrate on what
you're doing.


333
00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:52.682
And always remember:

334
00:36:52.684 --> 00:36:56.086
Don't mess with the monkey.

335
00:37:10.868 --> 00:37:13.837
Tread carefully, kubo.
This isn't one of your stories.


336
00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:16.473
How do you know?
Maybe it is.


337
00:37:16.475 --> 00:37:19.976
And I'm the Valiant hero,
and you're the mean monkey.


338
00:37:19.978 --> 00:37:22.245
Heroes come and go.
Any moment,


339
00:37:22.247 --> 00:37:24.948
something terrible could
come out of nowhere, and...


340
00:37:25.983 --> 00:37:27.083
Monkey!

341
00:37:27.085 --> 00:37:28.618
Kubo!

342
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:42.966
Monkey, wait!

343
00:37:44.001 --> 00:37:46.669
He wasn't trying to hurt me.

344
00:37:46.671 --> 00:37:48.838
He just wanted hanzo.

345
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.707
Hanzo?

346
00:37:50.709 --> 00:37:52.342
Hanzo.

347
00:37:57.448 --> 00:37:59.416
I still think
I'm gonna stab him.


348
00:37:59.418 --> 00:38:01.551
Why must you always
assume the worst?


349
00:38:01.553 --> 00:38:04.421
Oh, well, pardon me
for not trusting this giant,


350
00:38:04.423 --> 00:38:06.389
spiky insect-monster
that just kidnapped you!


351
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:09.125
Hanzo. Yes,
i remember him.


352
00:38:09.127 --> 00:38:11.961
I think maybe
he was my master.


353
00:38:11.963 --> 00:38:13.763
What? What did you say?

354
00:38:14.865 --> 00:38:18.168
We had a crest.
A samurai crest.


355
00:38:25.409 --> 00:38:27.444
Have you seen
this crest before?


356
00:38:30.147 --> 00:38:34.417
Ohh! This is a miracle.

357
00:38:34.419 --> 00:38:38.755
You have our robes.
You're wearing our robes!


358
00:38:38.757 --> 00:38:40.757
Why are you
wearing our robes?


359
00:38:40.759 --> 00:38:42.759
He doesn't have to
answer your questions.


360
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:44.761
Anyway, who are you?

361
00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:49.399
Many years ago,
i was cursed.


362
00:38:49.401 --> 00:38:52.135
Trapped in
this cursed state.


363
00:38:52.137 --> 00:38:56.105
Cursed to wander the far lands.

364
00:38:56.107 --> 00:38:58.608
Cursed-- or "cur-sed."

365
00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:01.911
No comrades, no master.

366
00:39:01.913 --> 00:39:04.514
Not even a name
or a single memory


367
00:39:04.516 --> 00:39:07.817
of the noble warrior
i once was.


368
00:39:07.819 --> 00:39:09.986
You used to be a man?

369
00:39:09.988 --> 00:39:11.688
No, not just any man.

370
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.790
A samurai.

371
00:39:13.792 --> 00:39:15.859
I mean, I'm pretty certain.

372
00:39:15.861 --> 00:39:17.861
Look, I had the stuff.

373
00:39:17.863 --> 00:39:20.096
I'm either a samurai
or a really bad hoarder.


374
00:39:20.098 --> 00:39:24.434
Either way, inside my thorax
beats the heart of a warrior.


375
00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:28.438
If you have no memory,
how can you be certain
of anything?


376
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.640
Because i-
- I get flashes.

377
00:39:30.642 --> 00:39:35.879
They-- they come about from
objects I find on my travels.


378
00:39:35.881 --> 00:39:40.350
Sometimes it's a sound
or a smell.


379
00:39:40.352 --> 00:39:42.519
You must get a lot of flashes.

380
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:44.521
But the memories, they fade,

381
00:39:44.523 --> 00:39:46.956
and all I'm left with
is the sense that I was


382
00:39:46.958 --> 00:39:49.893
once part of something
much greater.


383
00:39:49.895 --> 00:39:53.196
Monkey, can I tell him?
I really don't think
that's a good idea.


384
00:39:53.198 --> 00:39:54.964
He has a right.
Absolutely not.


385
00:39:54.966 --> 00:39:55.965
But--
no "buts."


386
00:39:55.967 --> 00:39:57.066
I--
no!


387
00:39:57.068 --> 00:39:58.167
What? Tell me what?
N-n--


388
00:39:58.169 --> 00:40:00.503
hanzo was my father.
Kubo!


389
00:40:00.505 --> 00:40:02.906
This is a miracle.

390
00:40:02.908 --> 00:40:04.974
I have found the son
of my master!


391
00:40:07.177 --> 00:40:09.212
Don't even.
Now,


392
00:40:09.214 --> 00:40:12.081
whatever brings you
to these lands,


393
00:40:12.083 --> 00:40:15.552
whatever your quest,
it is now my quest too.


394
00:40:15.554 --> 00:40:20.223
I will join you,
and I will give my life for you
if necessary.


395
00:40:20.225 --> 00:40:22.025
Wow. You will?

396
00:40:22.027 --> 00:40:25.261
What, do you think
that's possible?


397
00:40:25.263 --> 00:40:27.564
Well-- I mean,
i know how these quests go.


398
00:40:27.566 --> 00:40:30.433
People die all the time.
They drop like flies.


399
00:40:30.435 --> 00:40:33.036
That doesn't matter,
'cause I have a feeling


400
00:40:33.038 --> 00:40:35.738
this is my destiny.

401
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.240
No, it isn't!

402
00:40:37.242 --> 00:40:39.242
We can't trust
anything you say,


403
00:40:39.244 --> 00:40:41.844
because you can't trust
anything you say.


404
00:40:41.846 --> 00:40:44.948
We don't know
anything about you.


405
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:47.183
Monkey, you said it yourself.

406
00:40:47.185 --> 00:40:49.552
Our quest
is a difficult one.


407
00:40:49.554 --> 00:40:52.255
A samurai,
even a cursed one


408
00:40:52.257 --> 00:40:54.691
with no memory,
that looks like a bug,


409
00:40:54.693 --> 00:40:56.893
could be helpful.
Yes.


410
00:40:56.895 --> 00:40:59.796
I am certain
i could be helpful,
indispensible.


411
00:40:59.798 --> 00:41:02.365
In what way?

412
00:41:09.974 --> 00:41:13.476
Firing an arrow into
a wall is hardly
what I'd call--


413
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.915
impressive.
Oh, look at that.


414
00:41:18.917 --> 00:41:20.717
Literally the first time
I've ever done it.


415
00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:23.886
Just tell me of our quest,
and I will quickly demonstrate


416
00:41:23.888 --> 00:41:27.056
my numerous
indispensibilities.


417
00:41:27.058 --> 00:41:30.226
Well, that's kind of
a long story.


418
00:41:30.228 --> 00:41:32.895
You've got my attention.
I promise, I won't even blink.


419
00:41:32.897 --> 00:41:34.764
I actually don't think
i even can blink.


420
00:41:34.766 --> 00:41:36.766
Do I have eyelids?
Fine.


421
00:41:36.768 --> 00:41:38.868
Walk and talk.
Hanzo has found a path.


422
00:42:00.824 --> 00:42:03.993
So, you used to be
a toy monkey.


423
00:42:03.995 --> 00:42:07.530
Kubo, I really don't
see how this part is
important to our story.


424
00:42:07.532 --> 00:42:11.134
I kept her in my pocket.
She was only, like, this big.


425
00:42:11.136 --> 00:42:12.602
Okay. Kubo, that's enough.

426
00:42:12.604 --> 00:42:14.771
Tiny. And she was
called "Mr. monkey."


427
00:42:14.773 --> 00:42:16.606
I wasn't a toy.

428
00:42:16.608 --> 00:42:18.541
I was a charm.

429
00:42:18.543 --> 00:42:20.543
Of course you were.

430
00:42:37.028 --> 00:42:38.361
Aah!

431
00:42:41.832 --> 00:42:44.267
That doesn't look good.

432
00:42:45.302 --> 00:42:46.769
Don't touch anything.

433
00:42:54.244 --> 00:42:56.813
He did it.

434
00:43:15.699 --> 00:43:18.668
Okay.

435
00:43:25.843 --> 00:43:29.879
No, no, no,

436
00:43:29.881 --> 00:43:32.014
ahh!

437
00:43:32.016 --> 00:43:34.550
Yes.

438
00:43:34.552 --> 00:43:37.854
Kubo, look.

439
00:43:43.127 --> 00:43:45.595
The sword unbreakable.

440
00:43:45.597 --> 00:43:47.897
It could be a trap.
Mm.


441
00:43:47.899 --> 00:43:49.766
Allow me.

442
00:43:49.768 --> 00:43:52.068
What? It's not a trap
if you do it?


443
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.837
Stealth is my middle name.

444
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.608
You don't even
have a first name.


445
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.443
Don't worry. I got this.

446
00:44:07.418 --> 00:44:10.920
The mighty beetle
is victorious!


447
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.650
Look, i-i don't got this.

448
00:44:40.652 --> 00:44:43.152
I don't got this!
Oh, for crying out loud!


449
00:44:43.154 --> 00:44:47.023
I invoke
the sword unbreakable!


450
00:44:47.025 --> 00:44:49.792
It broke.

451
00:44:49.794 --> 00:44:53.029
So, does it just mean
the handle, or...


452
00:44:53.031 --> 00:44:55.498
I'm a little disappointed
with this magic sword.


453
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.100
It's not the right sword,
you idiot!


454
00:45:03.373 --> 00:45:04.540
Look!

455
00:45:05.876 --> 00:45:08.177
The sword!
It's in his head!


456
00:45:08.179 --> 00:45:11.848
Hey! I've got a bone
to pick with you.


457
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.851
See, because
he's made of bones.


458
00:45:14.853 --> 00:45:16.719
You're an embarrassment.

459
00:45:18.656 --> 00:45:20.957
Uh, this is problematic.

460
00:45:20.959 --> 00:45:22.124
Aah!

461
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:31.534
Enough with the arrows!

462
00:46:04.368 --> 00:46:06.235
Oh, foot!

463
00:46:10.173 --> 00:46:11.407
You can fly?

464
00:46:11.409 --> 00:46:13.743
Apparently. Yes!

465
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.804
Are you sure it isn't
the sword unfindable?


466
00:46:46.911 --> 00:46:48.945
I think I found it!

467
00:46:50.648 --> 00:46:52.815
A hand here! Anyone?

468
00:46:54.719 --> 00:46:55.785
Anyone else?

469
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:01.223
Kubo!
Huh?


470
00:47:15.272 --> 00:47:17.006
Kubo?
Monkey!


471
00:47:18.175 --> 00:47:20.276
Whoa!
No!


472
00:47:20.278 --> 00:47:22.144
No!

473
00:47:24.281 --> 00:47:25.281
Ah!

474
00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:38.361
Yes!

475
00:47:40.198 --> 00:47:41.697
Thank goodness that's over.

476
00:47:57.481 --> 00:48:01.117
Everything turning black.

477
00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:03.185
Then open your eyes.

478
00:48:03.187 --> 00:48:06.889
Uh-oh. I can't feel my wings.

479
00:48:06.891 --> 00:48:09.725
You didn't even know
you had them
five minutes ago.


480
00:48:09.727 --> 00:48:11.360
Stop wriggling.

481
00:48:11.362 --> 00:48:13.162
There.
Is that feeling better?


482
00:48:13.164 --> 00:48:14.730
Ooh, yeah.
A little to the left.


483
00:48:14.732 --> 00:48:17.333
Down just a bit.

484
00:48:17.335 --> 00:48:20.302
Oh, right there.
That's good.


485
00:48:20.304 --> 00:48:22.538
Wait.
You're being nice to me.


486
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.206
Shh.
Don't tell anyone.


487
00:48:24.208 --> 00:48:25.374
We did it beetle!

488
00:48:25.376 --> 00:48:28.044
We got the sword!

489
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:34.417
Whoa, put that down.
It's sharp.


490
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:41.590
Ohh...

491
00:48:41.592 --> 00:48:43.426
Ooh. Ooh. Mm.

492
00:48:43.428 --> 00:48:46.062
Okay. We're done here.

493
00:48:46.064 --> 00:48:48.664
Get up. We have a lot
of walking to do.


494
00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:50.032
You can't be serious.

495
00:48:50.034 --> 00:48:52.334
I'm always serious.

496
00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:55.004
Are you two going
to fight again?


497
00:48:55.006 --> 00:48:57.440
Of course not. We're having
a grown up conversation.


498
00:48:57.442 --> 00:48:58.874
You're going
to fight again.


499
00:48:58.876 --> 00:49:01.110
Kubo, just go over there
and play with something.


500
00:49:01.112 --> 00:49:02.845
Not that!

501
00:49:02.847 --> 00:49:06.348
Monkey, this is
the long lake.


502
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.784
We can't walk around it.

503
00:49:09.854 --> 00:49:11.787
I can carry kubo.

504
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:13.022
Carry kubo.

505
00:49:13.024 --> 00:49:14.557
That's your better idea?

506
00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.093
Look, I appreciate your help.
I really do.


507
00:49:17.095 --> 00:49:18.761
But when it comes
to the boy


508
00:49:18.763 --> 00:49:20.362
I know what's best.
Oh, is that right?


509
00:49:20.364 --> 00:49:22.698
And what's best is not
to be fielding ideas


510
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.033
from a talking cockroach.

511
00:49:24.035 --> 00:49:26.068
This coming from
a talking monkey.


512
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.436
I can still hear you,
you know.


513
00:49:27.438 --> 00:49:29.305
Then play louder!

514
00:49:29.307 --> 00:49:31.907
This conversation is over.
Monkeys don't swim.


515
00:49:31.909 --> 00:49:34.410
Not to worry.
Monkey see, monkey do.


516
00:49:34.412 --> 00:49:36.712
How long have you been waiting
to say that?


517
00:49:36.714 --> 00:49:38.214
Ever since I met you.

518
00:49:38.216 --> 00:49:40.282
Hey, what were we "grown up
conversation"-ing about?


519
00:49:40.284 --> 00:49:41.884
You're ridiculous.

520
00:49:41.886 --> 00:49:43.719
You're just
absolutely ridiculous.


521
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:48.057
Ridiculous! Crossing the lake
is a ridiculous idea.


522
00:49:48.059 --> 00:49:51.160
It's not your fault.
There's no sense left
in your head.


523
00:49:51.162 --> 00:49:54.430
I think I resent that.
I may not know everything.


524
00:49:54.432 --> 00:49:56.098
Anything.
Anything.


525
00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.300
But I do know kubo
is more capable


526
00:49:58.302 --> 00:49:59.735
than you think he is.

527
00:49:59.737 --> 00:50:02.438
You're being a tiny bit
overprotective here.


528
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.240
I'm being a lot
overprotective here.


529
00:50:04.242 --> 00:50:06.308
It's my job
to make sure kubo is safe


530
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:10.112
and that is not safe.
You! You are not safe.


531
00:50:10.114 --> 00:50:11.947
Kubo is just a child.

532
00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:14.984
And an incredibly gifted one.
He just saved our lives.


533
00:50:14.986 --> 00:50:16.652
Yes, he's very powerful.

534
00:50:16.654 --> 00:50:20.289
But he still has much
to learn.


535
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.024
What?

536
00:50:25.762 --> 00:50:27.696
Well,
fast learner.


537
00:50:32.035 --> 00:50:34.203
Did you know
you could do that?


538
00:50:43.046 --> 00:50:44.613
Show off.

539
00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:08.304
Okay, now take
a deep breath.


540
00:51:09.974 --> 00:51:12.341
Clear your mind.

541
00:51:12.343 --> 00:51:14.376
Guess I got that
part covered.


542
00:51:14.378 --> 00:51:18.214
Now draw back slowly.
That's it.


543
00:51:18.216 --> 00:51:21.717
Close one eye.
Guess you've got
that part covered.


544
00:51:21.719 --> 00:51:25.654
Concentrate on what
is directly in front of you


545
00:51:25.656 --> 00:51:28.224
and let everything else
fall away.


546
00:51:28.226 --> 00:51:32.161
And... release!

547
00:51:32.163 --> 00:51:33.696
Ha, hey!
Yeah!


548
00:51:33.698 --> 00:51:36.398
Perfect shot!
Perfect shot!


549
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.534
Not bad.
And what's your plan


550
00:51:38.536 --> 00:51:40.002
for getting the fish
into the boat


551
00:51:40.004 --> 00:51:41.303
so we can actually eat it?

552
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:49.111
Well, I said
i was teaching him how to shoot.


553
00:51:49.113 --> 00:51:52.748
Not fish. Fishing
is tomorrow's lesson.


554
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.383
Give me that.
Whoa.


555
00:51:54.385 --> 00:51:56.018
Grabby monkey.

556
00:51:57.354 --> 00:51:59.321
Now try it.

557
00:52:01.057 --> 00:52:04.793
Pull back and...

558
00:52:04.795 --> 00:52:06.729
Yes!

559
00:52:06.731 --> 00:52:08.397
- Whoo-hoo!
- Mm.


560
00:52:08.399 --> 00:52:11.533
The rope.
It's a pretty good idea.


561
00:52:11.535 --> 00:52:14.103
Hm. And you're not
an awful shot.


562
00:52:16.974 --> 00:52:19.642
Okay. Now you two
are being weird.


563
00:52:21.278 --> 00:52:23.779
Um, we're going to
need something


564
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:26.015
to cut this with.

565
00:52:34.557 --> 00:52:36.525
Sword unbreakable.

566
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:42.965
Mm.

567
00:52:45.435 --> 00:52:49.338
Mm. Mm. Mm.

568
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.308
Mm.

569
00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:57.513
Must you play with your food?

570
00:52:59.849 --> 00:53:01.483
Yes.

571
00:53:05.322 --> 00:53:06.822
What's the matter, kubo?

572
00:53:06.824 --> 00:53:09.458
You act like
you've never had a meal


573
00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.995
sitting between a monkey
and a beetle before.


574
00:53:12.997 --> 00:53:15.964
I've never had a meal sitting
between anyone before.


575
00:53:15.966 --> 00:53:18.600
Come on. Eat.
You need energy.


576
00:53:18.602 --> 00:53:20.336
And this is much better than
whale soup.


577
00:53:20.338 --> 00:53:23.439
Kubo, question.

578
00:53:23.441 --> 00:53:26.642
Before you started
on your heroic quest,


579
00:53:26.644 --> 00:53:28.877
what were your like?

580
00:53:28.879 --> 00:53:32.348
Well, I looked after
my mother mostly.


581
00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:35.851
And I told stories
about mighty warriors


582
00:53:35.853 --> 00:53:40.289
seeking revenge with battles
and monsters and magic.


583
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:43.225
I was pretty good
at telling them.


584
00:53:43.227 --> 00:53:45.627
Not so good
eat ending them.


585
00:53:45.629 --> 00:53:49.298
Sometimes I would tell my mother
stories about little things.


586
00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.400
Like skimming rocks across
the river


587
00:53:51.402 --> 00:53:55.704
or catching fireflies
in the mulberry fields.


588
00:53:55.706 --> 00:53:57.239
And when I told
those stories,


589
00:53:57.241 --> 00:53:59.908
I could see her eyes
were mostly clear.


590
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.311
I could tell she saw me.

591
00:54:02.313 --> 00:54:04.546
Really saw me.

592
00:54:04.548 --> 00:54:08.317
I could see her too.
Her real self.


593
00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:10.386
Her spirit

594
00:54:10.388 --> 00:54:13.322
trying to find its way out.

595
00:54:13.324 --> 00:54:15.391
It was beautiful.

596
00:54:19.996 --> 00:54:21.196
You know something, kubo?

597
00:54:21.198 --> 00:54:23.866
Back when
you just told stories,


598
00:54:23.868 --> 00:54:26.335
before you went on
this great adventure


599
00:54:26.337 --> 00:54:29.438
you were still
very much a hero.


600
00:54:48.591 --> 00:54:50.793
We're going to have
to head for shore.


601
00:54:50.795 --> 00:54:53.028
Find a hiding place and...

602
00:55:00.637 --> 00:55:02.771
The second piece of armor!

603
00:55:02.773 --> 00:55:06.241
The breastplate.
It's down there?


604
00:55:06.243 --> 00:55:08.076
Okay, I got it.
Beetle, wait!


605
00:55:08.078 --> 00:55:09.645
No, don't worry.

606
00:55:09.647 --> 00:55:11.380
Beetles can hold
their breath underwater


607
00:55:11.382 --> 00:55:13.415
for a very long time.
What?


608
00:55:13.417 --> 00:55:15.884
Since when?
It's a well known fact, monkey.


609
00:55:15.886 --> 00:55:17.753
So you don't remember
anything at all


610
00:55:17.755 --> 00:55:20.422
but beetles swimming,
that's what sticks in there?


611
00:55:20.424 --> 00:55:24.326
No, beetle. My mother told me
a story about the long lake.


612
00:55:24.328 --> 00:55:27.329
There's something under
the water.
Oh, yeah?


613
00:55:27.331 --> 00:55:30.499
Um, what kind of something?

614
00:55:30.501 --> 00:55:33.268
She said there was
a garden of eyes.


615
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:36.638
Eyes that stare into you.
Into your soul.


616
00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.407
They show you secrets.

617
00:55:38.409 --> 00:55:41.310
Things to keep you
down there with them.


618
00:55:41.312 --> 00:55:45.180
Forever.
Okay.


619
00:55:45.182 --> 00:55:48.283
Well, I won't look directly
into anyone's eyes.


620
00:55:48.285 --> 00:55:51.086
Even if
I'm being incredibly Sincere.


621
00:55:52.422 --> 00:55:53.522
You're gonna miss me,
monkey?


622
00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:05.167
Be careful.

623
00:56:31.027 --> 00:56:33.662
He's searching for
the armor.


624
00:56:33.664 --> 00:56:35.964
Just like
his insolent father.


625
00:56:35.966 --> 00:56:37.799
Yes, sister.

626
00:56:37.801 --> 00:56:42.471
Then we must ensure
he does not find
what remains.


627
00:56:53.516 --> 00:56:55.851
Monkey, I think
he's in trouble!


628
00:56:55.853 --> 00:56:57.819
We should help him!

629
00:56:57.821 --> 00:56:59.555
Kubo, your aunts
are still out there.


630
00:56:59.557 --> 00:57:02.190
I'm sorry, but we have
to head for shore.


631
00:57:04.028 --> 00:57:05.627
Kubo!

632
00:57:14.905 --> 00:57:16.772
Look at this!

633
00:57:16.774 --> 00:57:21.577
I come fishing
and all I reel in
is a stinking ape.


634
00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:24.780
How pathetic that
this filthy creature


635
00:57:24.782 --> 00:57:27.549
is all that's left of
my sister's magic.


636
00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:31.253
This filthy creature
will tear you apart!


637
00:58:05.955 --> 00:58:08.056
Kubo...

638
00:58:23.239 --> 00:58:25.507
Kubo!

639
00:58:27.144 --> 00:58:28.977
I have crushed creatures

640
00:58:28.979 --> 00:58:31.913
who could fit this world
on their fingernail.


641
00:58:31.915 --> 00:58:34.750
This victory brings me
no honor.


642
00:58:38.154 --> 00:58:42.524
Imagine how you're going
to feel when you lose.


643
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:46.928
I felt loss only once.

644
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.998
Eleven years ago
i lost my sister.


645
00:58:52.102 --> 00:58:56.004
She fell in love with a fool
and betrayed our father.


646
00:58:58.676 --> 00:59:01.810
She was an ungrateful coward!

647
00:59:11.688 --> 00:59:14.423
Who's the coward now?

648
00:59:26.536 --> 00:59:28.737
I got it! I got it!

649
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:34.176
Beetle! Wh-what happened?
Where's kubo?


650
00:59:34.178 --> 00:59:36.178
Um...

651
00:59:42.853 --> 00:59:46.254
Uh-oh!

652
00:59:52.995 --> 00:59:56.865
Get back down there!
He's in trouble!


653
00:59:56.867 --> 00:59:59.234
I got it.

654
01:00:11.748 --> 01:00:13.915
Mother. Mother.

655
01:00:48.251 --> 01:00:50.152
It never fails to amaze me

656
01:00:50.154 --> 01:00:51.653
how the creatures down here

657
01:00:51.655 --> 01:00:54.723
fight so hard just
to die another day.


658
01:00:54.725 --> 01:00:57.359
Down here there
are days worth fighting for.


659
01:00:58.795 --> 01:01:01.396
There is nothing down here
worth anything!


660
01:01:08.639 --> 01:01:11.072
It's pathetic what happened
to my sister.


661
01:01:11.074 --> 01:01:14.409
I looked up to her.
She was so strong.


662
01:01:14.411 --> 01:01:17.913
And love made her weak.

663
01:01:17.915 --> 01:01:19.347
No!

664
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:22.017
It made me stronger!

665
01:01:35.598 --> 01:01:36.898
Ahh!

666
01:01:38.201 --> 01:01:39.835
Over here!

667
01:01:39.837 --> 01:01:41.970
The eyes.

668
01:01:41.972 --> 01:01:45.106
It was the eyes.

669
01:01:45.108 --> 01:01:47.709
They had him in a trance.

670
01:01:47.711 --> 01:01:50.545
Oh, no! No!

671
01:01:50.547 --> 01:01:53.181
Come on! Come on, kubo!

672
01:01:53.183 --> 01:01:58.486
Wake up! Please, wake up!

673
01:01:58.488 --> 01:02:02.490
Please, please wake up.

674
01:02:02.492 --> 01:02:04.226
It's gonna be alright.

675
01:02:04.228 --> 01:02:07.162
It's gonna be alright.

676
01:02:07.164 --> 01:02:11.166
I'm here. I'm right here.

677
01:02:32.556 --> 01:02:35.423
I saw...

678
01:02:35.425 --> 01:02:37.559
What?
What did you see?


679
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:39.427
I saw...

680
01:02:39.429 --> 01:02:42.564
Mother.

681
01:02:42.566 --> 01:02:45.767
My son.

682
01:02:58.114 --> 01:03:01.483
So you must look more like
your dad then.


683
01:03:04.553 --> 01:03:07.889
You're staring.

684
01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:10.625
Let me guess,
you have questions.


685
01:03:10.627 --> 01:03:13.094
Why...
I'll start.


686
01:03:13.096 --> 01:03:16.298
First question.
If I'm beetle
and you're monkey,


687
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.700
why isn't he called boy?

688
01:03:20.703 --> 01:03:23.138
Oh, boy.

689
01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.040
Questions can wait.

690
01:03:25.042 --> 01:03:26.574
We need sleep.

691
01:03:26.576 --> 01:03:28.410
Tell us your story.

692
01:03:28.412 --> 01:03:30.211
Then we can sleep.

693
01:03:30.213 --> 01:03:32.547
Please?

694
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:36.351
Okay. Perhaps you can help me.

695
01:03:44.428 --> 01:03:47.395
The night
i met your father,


696
01:03:47.397 --> 01:03:48.730
uh...

697
01:03:50.933 --> 01:03:52.133
Mother?

698
01:03:55.839 --> 01:03:57.339
My sisters and I

699
01:03:57.341 --> 01:04:01.242
went to the temple of bones
to kill hanzo.


700
01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:17.359
At the bidding of the moon king,

701
01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:19.160
my sisters and I had come down

702
01:04:19.162 --> 01:04:22.530
from the night sky
and killed many noble warriors.


703
01:04:22.532 --> 01:04:25.500
Your grandfather told us

704
01:04:25.502 --> 01:04:28.269
that any man who found
the magical armor


705
01:04:28.271 --> 01:04:30.038
would grow too powerful

706
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.474
and be a threat to the heavens.

707
01:04:32.476 --> 01:04:37.178
That night I arrived at
the temple before my sisters.


708
01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.647
And there he was.

709
01:04:39.649 --> 01:04:41.783
The mighty hanzo.

710
01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:47.355
"You have offended my father,"
i told him.


711
01:04:47.357 --> 01:04:50.291
"Now you must die."
Yeah,


712
01:04:50.293 --> 01:04:54.496
that's so you.
Beetle! Shh.


713
01:04:54.498 --> 01:04:56.931
We fought.

714
01:05:01.137 --> 01:05:03.905
Hanzo was strong.

715
01:05:03.907 --> 01:05:05.974
But then he stopped.

716
01:05:05.976 --> 01:05:07.642
He looked into my eyes

717
01:05:07.644 --> 01:05:10.745
and uttered four simple words.

718
01:05:10.747 --> 01:05:13.181
These words changed everything.

719
01:05:13.183 --> 01:05:17.585
"I love you...

720
01:05:17.587 --> 01:05:19.154
Monkey"?

721
01:05:21.323 --> 01:05:25.360
"You are my quest,"
he whispered.


722
01:05:25.362 --> 01:05:28.229
I had seen
the wonders of the universe,


723
01:05:28.231 --> 01:05:30.365
but the warmth of his gaze

724
01:05:30.367 --> 01:05:34.769
as I looked into his eyes that,

725
01:05:34.771 --> 01:05:36.905
that I had never known.

726
01:05:36.907 --> 01:05:39.374
It was his humanity I saw

727
01:05:39.376 --> 01:05:43.945
and it was more powerful than
anything in my cold realm.


728
01:05:43.947 --> 01:05:46.915
In recognizing his compassion,

729
01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:49.184
I recognized my own.

730
01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:50.952
I spared his life.

731
01:05:50.954 --> 01:05:53.121
He gave me mine.

732
01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:58.059
And-- and then he gave me you.

733
01:05:58.061 --> 01:06:01.096
But your grandfather found us.

734
01:06:01.098 --> 01:06:04.699
His rage at my betrayal shook
the heavens.


735
01:06:10.106 --> 01:06:13.541
Your father and his army gave
their lives,


736
01:06:13.543 --> 01:06:17.345
allowing me to escape
with you in my arms.


737
01:06:19.915 --> 01:06:23.084
Why does grandfather hate me?

738
01:06:23.086 --> 01:06:26.054
Oh, kubo.

739
01:06:26.056 --> 01:06:27.622
He doesn't hate you.

740
01:06:27.624 --> 01:06:31.326
He wants to make you
just like him.


741
01:06:31.328 --> 01:06:36.231
Blind to humanity
as I once was.


742
01:06:36.233 --> 01:06:38.800
Only then can you
take your place


743
01:06:38.802 --> 01:06:41.102
beside him as part
of his family.


744
01:06:41.104 --> 01:06:44.005
Cold and hard

745
01:06:44.007 --> 01:06:47.142
and perfect.

746
01:06:47.144 --> 01:06:50.645
I'll never be like him.
Never.


747
01:06:53.015 --> 01:06:54.349
I know.

748
01:07:04.994 --> 01:07:06.694
He's exhausted.

749
01:07:06.696 --> 01:07:09.697
Mm. Me too.

750
01:07:09.699 --> 01:07:12.433
I'm not tucking you in.

751
01:07:15.771 --> 01:07:17.639
You're hurt.

752
01:07:17.641 --> 01:07:20.175
Ow.
It's just a scratch.


753
01:07:22.611 --> 01:07:25.513
Monkey, why didn't you tell him

754
01:07:25.515 --> 01:07:28.349
sooner who you really are?

755
01:07:29.952 --> 01:07:33.121
The magic that keeps me here,

756
01:07:33.123 --> 01:07:35.356
it's fading.

757
01:07:35.358 --> 01:07:37.992
Soon I'll be gone

758
01:07:37.994 --> 01:07:40.328
and then kubo will
be alone again.


759
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:44.465
Not alone.
He is the son of hanzo.


760
01:07:44.467 --> 01:07:48.403
I'll do everything I can
to keep him from harm.


761
01:07:48.405 --> 01:07:50.972
Thank you, beetle.

762
01:07:50.974 --> 01:07:54.309
To know kubo has someone
to watch over him


763
01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:56.844
when I'm gone,

764
01:07:56.846 --> 01:08:00.982
that would be a fine way
to end my story.


765
01:08:00.984 --> 01:08:04.586
Your story will never end.

766
01:08:04.588 --> 01:08:06.554
It will be told by him

767
01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:09.224
and by the people
he shares it with.


768
01:08:09.226 --> 01:08:11.526
And by the people
they share it with.


769
01:08:11.528 --> 01:08:13.995
And by the people
they share it with.


770
01:08:13.997 --> 01:08:16.397
And by the people
they share it with.


771
01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:18.233
And by
the people--
beetle.


772
01:08:18.235 --> 01:08:20.668
Th-the point is,

773
01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:25.073
your story will live on,
in him.


774
01:08:54.937 --> 01:08:57.205
Hello, my young friend.

775
01:08:57.207 --> 01:09:00.475
Why don't you
join in my song?


776
01:09:00.477 --> 01:09:02.610
But how did you? You're--

777
01:09:02.612 --> 01:09:05.380
even blinder than you?

778
01:09:05.382 --> 01:09:08.616
Twice as much,
to be precise.


779
01:09:08.618 --> 01:09:12.654
Which means I see double
the truth. Mm.


780
01:09:12.656 --> 01:09:15.390
This is all a dream.

781
01:09:15.392 --> 01:09:17.292
Is this a good dream
or a bad one?


782
01:09:17.294 --> 01:09:19.560
See for yourself.

783
01:09:36.912 --> 01:09:39.981
My father's fortress.
Yes.


784
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:48.923
The last piece of the armor.

785
01:09:48.925 --> 01:09:50.958
It's here?

786
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.262
Follow the setting sun
and you'll find it.


787
01:09:54.264 --> 01:09:58.199
In the place that might have
been your home.


788
01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:02.003
Claim your birthright,
kubo.


789
01:10:02.005 --> 01:10:06.074
Give this story a happy ending!

790
01:10:10.512 --> 01:10:12.547
Mother! Beetle!
Wake up!


791
01:10:12.549 --> 01:10:14.615
I'm up. I'm up.

792
01:10:14.617 --> 01:10:17.151
Well, I'm down. Mm.

793
01:10:17.153 --> 01:10:20.221
Off.
I think I slept on something.


794
01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:23.958
Sword uncomfortable.

795
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.993
The helmet.
I know where it is.


796
01:10:25.995 --> 01:10:27.729
I saw it in a dream, beetle!

797
01:10:27.731 --> 01:10:30.064
A dream?

798
01:10:30.066 --> 01:10:32.867
Well, that doesn't mean
anything in particular.


799
01:10:32.869 --> 01:10:35.470
I mean, I dreamt I fought
a giant skeleton


800
01:10:35.472 --> 01:10:37.038
with swords in its head.

801
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.407
That really happened.

802
01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:40.708
Oh, yeah.

803
01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:42.377
Beetle.

804
01:10:42.379 --> 01:10:44.278
Come on. This way!

805
01:11:20.949 --> 01:11:23.184
I spy with my one eye

806
01:11:23.186 --> 01:11:26.687
something beginning with "s."

807
01:11:28.524 --> 01:11:30.625
Snow.
No.


808
01:11:32.361 --> 01:11:34.395
Snowflake?
No.


809
01:11:34.397 --> 01:11:36.697
Okay. Oh.

810
01:11:36.699 --> 01:11:38.433
Snow-covered trees.

811
01:11:38.435 --> 01:11:41.102
Nothing to do with snow.

812
01:11:41.104 --> 01:11:43.271
How about serious?

813
01:11:43.273 --> 01:11:46.240
Stupid.

814
01:11:46.242 --> 01:11:48.876
Okay. I got it. Snow.

815
01:11:48.878 --> 01:11:51.979
He said it wasn't snow.

816
01:11:51.981 --> 01:11:53.414
It's a song.

817
01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:55.082
Well, that's not fair.

818
01:11:55.084 --> 01:11:57.652
How do you see a song?
You look.


819
01:11:59.989 --> 01:12:01.722
Golden heron.

820
01:12:01.724 --> 01:12:05.259
It's believed they hold
the souls of the departed.


821
01:12:05.261 --> 01:12:08.162
Carrying them over
to wherever they need to go.


822
01:12:08.164 --> 01:12:12.133
Hm. What are they singing?

823
01:12:12.135 --> 01:12:14.335
It's beautiful.

824
01:12:14.337 --> 01:12:18.973
Many say the song's about
what happens when we die.


825
01:12:18.975 --> 01:12:22.477
How we don't just disappear.

826
01:12:22.479 --> 01:12:26.113
We don't?
Ah, so what happens to us?


827
01:12:26.115 --> 01:12:28.816
Well, like
kubo's paper, we shift.


828
01:12:28.818 --> 01:12:31.018
We transform, so we can continue

829
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.854
our story to another place.

830
01:12:32.856 --> 01:12:37.258
The end of one story is merely
the beginning of another.


831
01:13:00.182 --> 01:13:02.283
I remember this place.

832
01:13:42.357 --> 01:13:45.626
This was where my father
prepared for his quest.


833
01:14:10.686 --> 01:14:12.920
There's something
i don't understand.


834
01:14:12.922 --> 01:14:14.855
Why would the helmet be here?

835
01:14:19.628 --> 01:14:20.928
Kubo!

836
01:14:52.495 --> 01:14:54.295
Ahh, release us!

837
01:14:54.297 --> 01:14:57.798
Oh, sister.

838
01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.435
I remember how
we looked up to you.


839
01:15:01.437 --> 01:15:04.572
Of all of us,
you shone the brightest.


840
01:15:04.574 --> 01:15:07.241
Such a waste.

841
01:15:07.243 --> 01:15:09.610
All we ever wished was to
be a family


842
01:15:09.612 --> 01:15:11.646
in our home among the stars.

843
01:15:11.648 --> 01:15:15.249
I think we have very different
definitions of family.


844
01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:16.851
Don't you touch him, you witch!

845
01:15:16.853 --> 01:15:18.786
And then there's you!

846
01:15:18.788 --> 01:15:22.289
The thieving insect
who stole my sister's soul.


847
01:15:22.291 --> 01:15:23.357
What?

848
01:15:23.359 --> 01:15:27.328
Oh, this is precious.

849
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:29.296
You've been together
all this time


850
01:15:29.298 --> 01:15:31.198
and you haven't even realized?

851
01:15:35.871 --> 01:15:37.972
You took her from us.

852
01:15:37.974 --> 01:15:41.475
It was only fitting
we took something from you.


853
01:15:41.477 --> 01:15:44.512
How swiftly those memories
spilled from your head,


854
01:15:44.514 --> 01:15:48.449
wiping out all recollection
of your obscene union...


855
01:15:48.451 --> 01:15:51.752
Hanzo.
What?


856
01:15:52.888 --> 01:15:53.921
Hanzo?

857
01:15:55.357 --> 01:15:58.025
I... i-i didn't know.

858
01:16:00.663 --> 01:16:01.696
No!

859
01:16:06.969 --> 01:16:10.738
I'm forgetting what
i came here for.


860
01:16:59.521 --> 01:17:00.588
Mother?

861
01:17:16.438 --> 01:17:19.073
Shh, it's okay.

862
01:17:19.075 --> 01:17:20.908
I'm here.

863
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:23.844
Father?
My son.


864
01:17:28.717 --> 01:17:33.387
Seems I'm married to a bug.

865
01:17:33.389 --> 01:17:37.258
Yeah. A samurai bug.

866
01:17:40.796 --> 01:17:43.964
You are my quest.

867
01:17:43.966 --> 01:17:45.566
You always have been.

868
01:17:47.637 --> 01:17:50.938
Hanzo, keep him safe.

869
01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.140
No matter what.

870
01:17:54.676 --> 01:17:56.677
I promise I will.

871
01:18:00.515 --> 01:18:02.716
Aahh!

872
01:18:05.654 --> 01:18:09.356
Oh!

873
01:18:09.358 --> 01:18:11.625
Fly home, kubo.

874
01:21:07.335 --> 01:21:09.436
Kubo, is that you?

875
01:21:11.807 --> 01:21:14.174
You have to leave this place.

876
01:21:14.176 --> 01:21:16.844
The moon king--
he's coming.


877
01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:32.693
Grandfather!

878
01:21:32.695 --> 01:21:34.395
It's me, kubo.

879
01:21:34.397 --> 01:21:37.197
I know you
can see me!


880
01:21:39.701 --> 01:21:41.835
Hello, grandson.

881
01:21:41.837 --> 01:21:44.838
It's so good
to see you at last.


882
01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.975
So to speak.

883
01:21:47.977 --> 01:21:52.913
And I see
you found the armor.


884
01:21:52.915 --> 01:21:56.150
Seems your mother had
a reason to bring you


885
01:21:56.152 --> 01:21:58.652
to this dreadful place
after all.


886
01:22:03.091 --> 01:22:04.925
I see.

887
01:22:06.562 --> 01:22:09.930
I know you do.
That's how this all began.


888
01:22:09.932 --> 01:22:11.932
You finally saw me.

889
01:22:11.934 --> 01:22:13.667
That was my fault.

890
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:15.669
I should've listened
to my parents.


891
01:22:15.671 --> 01:22:18.705
Hmm. Kubo,

892
01:22:18.707 --> 01:22:21.775
we both want
the exact same thing.


893
01:22:21.777 --> 01:22:23.844
You want to take
my other eye!


894
01:22:23.846 --> 01:22:25.079
That's what you want!

895
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:27.581
Well, yes.

896
01:22:27.583 --> 01:22:30.584
But do you know why
i want it?


897
01:22:30.586 --> 01:22:33.754
Because
you're old and mean...


898
01:22:33.756 --> 01:22:35.189
And cruel!

899
01:22:35.191 --> 01:22:38.025
Oh, now, that's a little harsh.

900
01:22:38.027 --> 01:22:42.362
As long as you cling
to that silly, useless eye...


901
01:22:42.364 --> 01:22:45.799
You can't come up
to live with me...


902
01:22:45.801 --> 01:22:48.268
In the heavens!

903
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:52.372
You'll be stuck down here
in this... hell!


904
01:22:52.374 --> 01:22:55.909
Staring with that lonely eye

905
01:22:55.911 --> 01:22:59.980
at hate and heartache
and suffering...


906
01:22:59.982 --> 01:23:02.983
And death!

907
01:23:05.821 --> 01:23:07.221
Where I want to take you,

908
01:23:07.223 --> 01:23:10.824
we have none of those things.

909
01:23:10.826 --> 01:23:14.895
It'll just be you,
with your family.


910
01:23:14.897 --> 01:23:18.298
Where you belong.
My family is gone.


911
01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:21.001
- You killed them.
- No!


912
01:23:21.003 --> 01:23:24.638
They brought their fates
upon themselves!


913
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.308
They disgraced me
and upset the order


914
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:31.812
of everything!
That's how your story goes.


915
01:23:33.414 --> 01:23:35.849
Oh, kubo.

916
01:23:35.851 --> 01:23:40.420
When you're up there with me,
you will be beyond stories.


917
01:23:40.422 --> 01:23:45.425
You will be...
Immortal!


918
01:23:45.427 --> 01:23:49.429
You will be...

919
01:23:49.431 --> 01:23:51.131
Infinite!

920
01:23:51.133 --> 01:23:54.168
No. You're wrong.

921
01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:57.804
Not infinite.
All stories have an end.


922
01:23:57.806 --> 01:24:01.108
Is that right?

923
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:04.244
And how does
this story end?


924
01:24:06.981 --> 01:24:09.116
I kill you.

925
01:24:09.118 --> 01:24:12.953
Oh. Very well.
Is this your wish?


926
01:24:12.955 --> 01:24:15.656
To do battle
with a hideous monster


927
01:24:15.658 --> 01:24:17.391
who ruined your life?

928
01:24:17.393 --> 01:24:22.229
To prove your worth,
like your doomed father?


929
01:24:22.231 --> 01:24:25.065
How mortal!

930
01:25:44.313 --> 01:25:47.214
You want to be human?

931
01:25:47.216 --> 01:25:51.518
Then share their weakness!

932
01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:55.789
Suffer their humiliation!

933
01:25:57.458 --> 01:26:00.727
Feel their pain!

934
01:26:00.729 --> 01:26:02.029
Ha!

935
01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:47.274
This is the end
of your story.


936
01:26:47.276 --> 01:26:52.212
Now take one last look
with that lonely eye.


937
01:26:52.214 --> 01:26:56.149
One last look
at this wretched place...


938
01:26:56.151 --> 01:26:58.552
You call home.

939
01:27:00.154 --> 01:27:02.656
I'm not leaving.

940
01:27:02.658 --> 01:27:05.392
For every horrible thing
down here,


941
01:27:05.394 --> 01:27:08.061
there's something
far more beautiful.


942
01:27:08.063 --> 01:27:11.064
My mother saw it.
So did my father.


943
01:27:11.066 --> 01:27:12.232
I see it.

944
01:27:12.234 --> 01:27:14.234
Even with just one eye.

945
01:27:14.236 --> 01:27:18.739
Then I'll just have to rip it
out of your head again,


946
01:27:18.741 --> 01:27:20.340
won't I?

947
01:27:22.845 --> 01:27:25.846
If you must blink, do it now.

948
01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:32.819
I know why
you want my eye.


949
01:27:32.821 --> 01:27:36.022
Because without it, I can't
look into the eyes of another


950
01:27:36.024 --> 01:27:38.358
and see their soul,
their love!


951
01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.095
Everything you loved
is gone!


952
01:27:42.097 --> 01:27:45.532
Everything you knew has been
taken from you?


953
01:27:45.534 --> 01:27:48.535
No! It's in my memories!

954
01:27:48.537 --> 01:27:50.837
The most powerful kind
of magic there is!


955
01:28:03.352 --> 01:28:06.586
It makes us stronger
than you'll ever be.


956
01:28:09.724 --> 01:28:13.860
These are the memories
of those we have loved and lost.


957
01:28:13.862 --> 01:28:17.631
And if we hold their stories
deep in our hearts...


958
01:28:17.633 --> 01:28:20.033
Then you will never
take them away from us.


959
01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.382
That really is
the least of it.


960
01:28:55.603 --> 01:28:57.170
Where am I? Uh...

961
01:28:57.172 --> 01:28:59.806
Hello, grandfather.
Wha--


962
01:28:59.808 --> 01:29:03.443
hello. Wh--

963
01:29:03.445 --> 01:29:05.779
what happened to your eye?

964
01:29:05.781 --> 01:29:07.447
Don't you remember?
Oh...


965
01:29:07.449 --> 01:29:11.852
Oh no--
I'm sorry, young man.


966
01:29:11.854 --> 01:29:16.122
I seem to have
forgotten my story.


967
01:29:16.124 --> 01:29:17.657
Can you help me?

968
01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:23.129
I'll tell him.
No, we'll all tell him.


969
01:29:23.131 --> 01:29:25.665
We'll tell him
everything he needs to know.


970
01:29:25.667 --> 01:29:30.837
You are the kindest,
sweetest man


971
01:29:30.839 --> 01:29:33.940
to ever live in this village.
Oh! Oh, really?


972
01:29:33.942 --> 01:29:36.676
- Yes.
- Uh, uh... every day,


973
01:29:36.678 --> 01:29:40.313
you walk around
smiling and handing
out coins to children.


974
01:29:40.315 --> 01:29:41.548
Like me!

975
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:44.150
And old women.
Oh.


976
01:29:44.152 --> 01:29:46.653
You-- you taught
my kids to swim!


977
01:29:46.655 --> 01:29:48.355
What?
And...


978
01:29:48.357 --> 01:29:50.056
You give blankets
to the poor!


979
01:29:50.058 --> 01:29:52.025
You're as good man.
You fed the hungry!


980
01:29:52.027 --> 01:29:53.827
You always lend
a helping hand!


981
01:29:53.829 --> 01:29:55.996
You're a great example!

982
01:29:55.998 --> 01:29:59.666
Yeah.
Oh! It turns out
I'm pretty selfless.


983
01:29:59.668 --> 01:30:01.401
That's why we love you!

984
01:30:01.403 --> 01:30:05.405
You know, we have
something in common.


985
01:30:05.407 --> 01:30:07.541
We both adore
your grandson.


986
01:30:09.043 --> 01:30:11.711
His name is kubo.

987
01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:16.082
Mm. "Kubo"?

988
01:30:16.084 --> 01:30:19.386
I'm sorry, uh...

989
01:30:19.388 --> 01:30:21.621
But i--
but I don't remember.


990
01:30:23.224 --> 01:30:28.028
Well, your grandson's
a storyteller.


991
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:32.399
He'll tell you
all the stories
you've forgotten.


992
01:30:32.401 --> 01:30:33.667
Really?

993
01:30:36.904 --> 01:30:39.239
Of course.

994
01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.101
Hello, mother.

995
01:31:08.103 --> 01:31:10.303
Father.

996
01:31:10.305 --> 01:31:13.039
I know my stories can
tend to get a little...


997
01:31:13.041 --> 01:31:15.575
Mm, long...

998
01:31:15.577 --> 01:31:19.212
So I'll keep this brief.

999
01:31:19.214 --> 01:31:22.616
I'm very grateful
I've had the chance
to meet you both,


1000
01:31:22.618 --> 01:31:27.220
hear your wisdom.
Feel your kindness,


1001
01:31:27.222 --> 01:31:29.489
even eat a meal
sitting between you.


1002
01:31:30.825 --> 01:31:33.627
This was a happy story.

1003
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:38.665
But it could still be
a whole lot happier...


1004
01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:42.636
I don't know exactly
what the rules are,


1005
01:31:42.638 --> 01:31:45.071
or how this works,

1006
01:31:45.073 --> 01:31:48.608
but if there were
any way to...


1007
01:31:48.610 --> 01:31:52.746
You know...
I still need you.


1008
01:31:52.748 --> 01:31:56.583
So I could say this
has been a happy story,


1009
01:31:56.585 --> 01:32:01.087
or I could feel it--
we could all feel it.


1010
01:32:01.089 --> 01:32:04.991
And then we could end
this story together.


1011
01:32:48.502 --> 01:32:50.403
The end.
