Linda, there's that guy
from the stereo store.


31
00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:20.005
Don't you think
helookshke Richard Gere?


32
00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:21.798
See his cute
little butt?


33
00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:25.010
You guys, let's talk about
that fox that just walked in.


34
00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:26.303
We already were.

35
00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:28.597
I'm gonna go over there
and change the shakers.


36
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.432
Coolout That's Stacy's secfion.

37
00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:31.850
He's too old.

38
00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:34.394
She's not even
in high school yet.


39
00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.897
Smoking's upstairs
to your left.


40
00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:39.441
Smoking's upstairs
to your left.


41
00:02:39.608 --> 00:02:41.401
Smoking's upstairs.

42
00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:45.280
Rat, is Dolly Parton giving you
a percentage of the profit?


43
00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:48.200
Vvhatcanl do for you, gentlemen?

44
00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:51.036
You the guy with the
Van Halen tickets?


45
00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.330
I could be.

46
00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:55.916
How much for something
in the first 10 rows'?


47
00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.084
$20 apiece.

48
00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:59.044
Those tickets
were only $12.50.


49
00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:00.545
So don't buy them.

50
00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.215
All the other scalpers
are sold out.


51
00:03:03.298 --> 00:03:06.510
Scalper? Did you
call me a scalper?


52
00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:11.098
Listen, gentlemen, I perform a service
here, and the service costs money.


53
00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:13.558
Do you want the tickets
or don't you?


54
00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:15.644
Okay,
we'll take them.


55
00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:18.730
All right.
What'd I say, $25?


56
00:03:18.814 --> 00:03:20.065
BOTHI $20!

57
00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:25.487
All right.
Thank you.


58
00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:31.368
Just made $16, Rats. What's the matter?
You look depressed.


59
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:35.497
I hate working the theater. All the
ac:tion's on the other side of the mall.


60
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.628
How's it going?

61
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.422
You want to take his table? Yes.

62
00:03:43.588 --> 00:03:45.382
Go for it. He's cute.

63
00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.594
Just take his order,
look him in the eye.


64
00:03:49.678 --> 00:03:51.304
If he says anything
remotely funny,


65
00:03:51.388 --> 00:03:54.141
laugh like you never heard
anything so funny.


66
00:03:54.474 --> 00:03:55.851
And smile.

67
00:03:59.563 --> 00:04:00.897
Go for it.

68
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:08.613
So, you working hard
or hardly working?


69
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.035
You look like you could
still be in high school.


70
00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.121
I know.
Everybody says that.


71
00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:17.414
How old are you?

72
00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:18.623
Nineteen.

73
00:04:18.707 --> 00:04:19.749
How old are you?

74
00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:20.917
Twenty six.

75
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.921
Do you think we could
still be friends?


76
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.258
So what can I get you?

77
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:31.136
How about
a meatball sandwich,


78
00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:35.724
a medium Coke,
and your phone number?


79
00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:48.612
Hi.
Hello.


80
00:04:49.863 --> 00:04:51.865
Get out of here,
Bradley.


81
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.951
Dave.
How you doing, Brad?


82
00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.244
Cooking!

83
00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:01.791
Daddy's home, boys. I shall serve
no fries before their time.


84
00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:10.509
This one's
on you, dude.


85
00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:13.011
<i>Who's got the
beaucoup dolares today?</i>


86
00:05:13.887 --> 00:05:15.263
<i>Uno dinero.</i>

87
00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:17.641
What have you got,
Mr. Buck Man?


88
00:05:17.724 --> 00:05:18.767
I got a cigarette.

89
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.811
I got <i>uno</i> "nickelette."

90
00:05:22.604 --> 00:05:26.566
Hey! You guys had shirts on
when you came in here.


91
00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:30.111
Something happened
to them, man.


92
00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:35.075
Come on, Spicoli,
just put the shirts back on.


93
00:05:35.617 --> 00:05:37.118
You see
that sign?


94
00:05:37.994 --> 00:05:41.873
"No shirts. No shoes.
No dice."


95
00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:44.626
Right.

96
00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.255
Learn it. Know it.
Live it.


97
00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:49.381
Whoa.

98
00:05:49.464 --> 00:05:51.299
He's the full hot orator.

99
00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:56.096
Linda, did I show you this?
He gave me his card.


100
00:05:56.263 --> 00:05:58.390
"Ron Johnson,
Audio Consultant."


101
00:05:58.473 --> 00:06:01.059
Maybe we should get a frame for
this and put it up on the wall.


102
00:06:01.142 --> 00:06:02.602
Come on, Linda. You're
the one who told me


103
00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:05.522
I was gonna get a
boyfriend at the mall.


104
00:06:05.605 --> 00:06:06.982
Do you think he'll
call this week?


105
00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:08.567
Why don't you
call him?


106
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.776
I can't.

107
00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:10.986
Yes, you can.

108
00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.238
Guys love
that sort of thing.


109
00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:14.990
Yes! Really?

110
00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:18.577
Stacy, what are you waiting for?
You're 15 years old.


111
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.706
I did it when Iwas 13. It's no huge thing.
Ifsjustsex.


112
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.083
He was hot,
wasn't he?


113
00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.460
If I didn't have a fiancĂ©
in Chicago, I'd go for it.


114
00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:40.348
Hey, how you doing?
Welcome to Ridgemont.


115
00:06:43.476 --> 00:06:45.270
Will it look okay?

116
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.361
<i>Well, she was an American girl</i>

117
00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:56.906
<i>Raised on promises</i>

118
00:06:57.574 --> 00:06:58.950
Do you know where
U.S. history is?


119
00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:01.494
Down the hall
and turn left.


120
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.171
<i>She was an American girl</i>

121
00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:31.441
Hi, Bradley.

122
00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:33.943
Grown up. Looking good.

123
00:07:34.903 --> 00:07:37.280
Another year
joined at the lips.


124
00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:39.157
Hi, Brad!

125
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.660
Denise. I'd make you see God.

126
00:07:42.202 --> 00:07:43.286
Brad!

127
00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:46.665
Big Cruising Vessel!

128
00:07:46.748 --> 00:07:47.916
Bradley!

129
00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:50.877
Thank you.

130
00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:55.173
Six more payments, gentlemen,
and this beautiful


131
00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:58.718
blue, four-door, luxury
sedan is all mine!


132
00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:02.180
I'll give you
four tickets in the fifth row


133
00:08:02.263 --> 00:08:04.974
for the low price of $140.

134
00:08:05.392 --> 00:08:06.601
See that car?

135
00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:09.145
Some alumni gave Jefferson
that car for playing football


136
00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.856
when he was a sophomore.
Helped him pick it out.


137
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.274
Slick car.

138
00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:15.527
We go way back,
you know.


139
00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:21.533
Hey, Charles,
how you doing, buddy?


140
00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:23.952
Car looks great.
I mean really terrific.


141
00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:26.788
You're really
keeping it up wonderfully.


142
00:08:26.996 --> 00:08:28.748
Don't fuck with it.

143
00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:35.922
Shit!
That's my man.


144
00:08:41.594 --> 00:08:42.595
Brad?

145
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.972
Arnold!
What's happening?


146
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.182
Can I talk to you
a minute?


147
00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:47.475
Sure, man.

148
00:08:48.184 --> 00:08:50.353
I really hate
Bronco Burger.


149
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.647
Ever since they started
with the chicken nuggets,


150
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:53.898
everything went
downhill.


151
00:08:53.982 --> 00:08:55.900
You have to fry
all their greasy food,


152
00:08:55.984 --> 00:08:57.694
and you have
to polish things.


153
00:08:57.777 --> 00:09:00.530
And the manager's
an asshole.


154
00:09:00.613 --> 00:09:02.115
I was just wondering...

155
00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:05.493
Arnold, do you want to work
at All American Burger?


156
00:09:05.869 --> 00:09:07.287
Yeah, well...

157
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.582
I can probably get you in. Just
let me talk to Dennis Taylor.


158
00:09:10.665 --> 00:09:11.750
All right.
Okay.


159
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.462
Wait. Did you hear
the bell ring?


160
00:09:15.545 --> 00:09:17.172
What bell?
We're here.


161
00:09:36.191 --> 00:09:37.358
<i>Aloha.</i>

162
00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:40.111
My name is Mr. Hand.

163
00:09:42.697 --> 00:09:44.741
I have but one question
for you.


164
00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:47.452
Can you attend my class?

165
00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:52.499
It is for your own good. And if you
oan't make it, I can make you.


166
00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:56.461
We have a 20
question quiz every Friday.


167
00:09:56.544 --> 00:09:59.506
Your grade is the average
of all your quizzes,


168
00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:02.634
plus the midterm and final
which counts for one-third.


169
00:10:02.717 --> 00:10:03.927
Got it?

170
00:10:05.386 --> 00:10:06.513
Also...

171
00:10:09.849 --> 00:10:14.395
There will be no eating.
E-A-T-I-N-G.


172
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:17.690
No eating in this class.

173
00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:21.486
You get used to doing your own
business on your own time.


174
00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:23.488
That's one demand I make.

175
00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:27.200
Just like you wouldn't want me to
come to your house some evening


176
00:10:27.283 --> 00:10:29.661
and discuss U.S. history
on your time, understand?


177
00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:30.995
Yes, sir.

178
00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:38.503
This guy's been stoned
since the third grade.


179
00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:41.005
Yes?

180
00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:42.465
Yeah, I'm registered
in this class.


181
00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:43.591
What class?

182
00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:44.884
This is U.S. history.

183
00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:46.052
I see the globe
right there.


184
00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:47.178
Really?

185
00:10:47.262 --> 00:10:49.597
Hey.
May I come in?


186
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:51.766
Oh, please.

187
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.562
I get so lonely when I hear
that third attendance bell ring


188
00:10:55.645 --> 00:10:57.897
and all my kids
are not here.


189
00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:03.111
Sorry, I'm late. It's just like this
new schedule's totally confusing.


190
00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.365
I know that dude.

191
00:11:07.657 --> 00:11:09.701
Mr. Spicoli.

192
00:11:09.784 --> 00:11:11.995
That's the name
they gave me.


193
00:11:14.122 --> 00:11:16.332
You're ripping my card.
Yes.


194
00:11:18.626 --> 00:11:20.879
Hey,bud,
what's your problem?


195
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:23.882
No problem at all.

196
00:11:24.173 --> 00:11:27.135
I think you know where
the front office is.


197
00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:29.971
You dick!

198
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:34.017
I have taken the time to
print up a complete schedule


199
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.895
of class quizzes and the
chapters they cover.


200
00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:39.689
Please pass them
to the desk behind you.


201
00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:42.150
Back, back, back.

202
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.871
Did you hear
about this surfer guy


203
00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:56.789
who pulled a knife on Mr.
Hand this morning?


204
00:11:56.873 --> 00:11:59.500
Oh, no!
He just called him a dick.


205
00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:00.919
A dick?

206
00:12:01.002 --> 00:12:03.504
Oh, God. People
exaggerate so much here.


207
00:12:04.881 --> 00:12:08.384
Linda, that girl looks
just like Pat Benatar.


208
00:12:08.468 --> 00:12:12.180
I know. Wait. There are
three girls at Ridgemont


209
00:12:12.263 --> 00:12:14.682
who have cultivated
the Pat Benatar look.


210
00:12:14.766 --> 00:12:16.309
Chanel Semlar,

211
00:12:17.268 --> 00:12:19.854
Mary Ann Zlotnick
in the red tights.


212
00:12:20.688 --> 00:12:22.774
Do you think guys
find that more attractive?


213
00:12:22.857 --> 00:12:26.361
Stacy, please, give me a break!
You are so much prettier!


214
00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:30.865
Yeah, I know, but do you think
they'd be better in bed?


215
00:12:31.366 --> 00:12:34.160
What do you mean? You
either do it or you don't.


216
00:12:34.243 --> 00:12:39.165
No. There are like variables
that I might not be good at.


217
00:12:39.248 --> 00:12:41.125
Like what variables?

218
00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:44.253
Like, you know,
giving blowjobs.


219
00:12:44.671 --> 00:12:46.464
What's the big deal?

220
00:12:47.215 --> 00:12:48.341
I never did it.

221
00:12:48.424 --> 00:12:50.343
You've never
given a blow job?


222
00:12:50.885 --> 00:12:55.139
Never? Stace, there's nothing to it.
It's so easy.


223
00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:58.643
Check it out.

224
00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:03.398
Relax your
throat muscles.


225
00:13:08.027 --> 00:13:11.072
Don't bite.
And slide it in.


226
00:13:19.247 --> 00:13:20.748
Try it again.

227
00:13:22.083 --> 00:13:24.585
Good. Push it slowly
in and out.


228
00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:28.589
You got it.
Okay.


229
00:13:29.257 --> 00:13:31.300
Can I ask you something and
you promise not to laugh?


230
00:13:31.384 --> 00:13:33.428
Sure.
Okay.


231
00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:36.973
When a guy has an orgasm,
how much comes out?


232
00:13:37.932 --> 00:13:39.434
A quart or so.

233
00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:42.937
No, I'm just kidding.
Just practice.


234
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.157
I'm not going to a morgue.

235
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.034
I'll get my mom
to write a note.


236
00:13:56.117 --> 00:13:59.078
Nobody's getting me into a room
with a bunch of dead guys.


237
00:13:59.162 --> 00:14:00.496
You have to go.

238
00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:03.249
It's part of the final.
I hear it's really disgusting.


239
00:14:03.332 --> 00:14:05.543
Do you know what they do?
Have you heard?


240
00:14:05.626 --> 00:14:06.753
What?

241
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.047
The bodies
are dissected


242
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.800
and Mr. Vargas pulls out parts of
the dead body and holds them up.


243
00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:15.803
You mean, he reaches in
and pulls this stuff out?


244
00:14:15.887 --> 00:14:17.805
Like stomach and
tumors or something?


245
00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:20.308
Yeah, stomach,
tumors, entrails.


246
00:14:20.767 --> 00:14:24.270
Good day, everyone.
My name is Mr. Vargas.


247
00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:27.565
Look. I'm a little slow today.

248
00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:30.568
I just switched to Sanka,
so have a heart.


249
00:14:32.153 --> 00:14:34.155
MR. VARGASI All right, now.

250
00:14:34.322 --> 00:14:35.990
<i>The World of Life.</i>

251
00:14:36.074 --> 00:14:39.327
That is the name of the
textbook we will be using.


252
00:14:40.453 --> 00:14:41.871
I'm in love.

253
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.166
See the mustache
coming in, Rat?


254
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.169
You can almost
cross it out.


255
00:14:49.337 --> 00:14:51.089
I'm in love.

256
00:14:51.172 --> 00:14:53.132
You are
a wuss.


257
00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:54.926
Part wimp
and part pussy.


258
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:58.596
What do you mean wuss?
This girl is my exact type.


259
00:14:58.679 --> 00:14:59.680
All right.

260
00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:00.848
Where'd you
see her?


261
00:15:00.932 --> 00:15:02.433
In my biology class.

262
00:15:02.517 --> 00:15:03.684
Did you get
her number?


263
00:15:03.768 --> 00:15:04.852
No.

264
00:15:05.686 --> 00:15:06.687
Did you get
her name?


265
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:08.272
No! No! It's too soon.

266
00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:10.316
It's never too soon, Rat.

267
00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:14.445
A girl decides how far she's gonna let
you go in the first five minutes.


268
00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:15.780
What am I supposed to do?

269
00:15:15.863 --> 00:15:18.324
Go up to this strange girl
in my biology class


270
00:15:18.407 --> 00:15:22.286
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to take
your clothes off and jump on me?"


271
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.663
I would.

272
00:15:24.163 --> 00:15:27.291
I can see it all now. This is gonna
be just like the last summer.


273
00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:29.460
You fell in love with
that girl at the Fotomat.


274
00:15:29.544 --> 00:15:31.838
You bought $40 worth
of fucking film,


275
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:33.881
and you never even
talked to her.


276
00:15:34.215 --> 00:15:35.591
You don't even
own a camera.


277
00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:38.219
You tell me, Mike.
What should I do?


278
00:15:38.302 --> 00:15:40.096
This is what
you do.


279
00:15:40.513 --> 00:15:43.474
Start from the minute
you walk into biology class.


280
00:15:43.724 --> 00:15:47.395
I mean, don't just walk in.
Move across the room.


281
00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:50.064
And you don't
talk to her.


282
00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:53.651
You use your face.
You use your body.


283
00:15:54.277 --> 00:15:57.196
Use everything.
That's what I do.


284
00:15:57.572 --> 00:15:59.365
I mean, I just
send out this vibe


285
00:15:59.448 --> 00:16:03.995
and I have personally found
that women do respond.


286
00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:06.122
I mean,
something happens.


287
00:16:06.205 --> 00:16:07.874
Naturally something
happens.


288
00:16:07.957 --> 00:16:11.752
You put the vibe out to 30 million
chicks, something is gonna happen.


289
00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:15.173
That's the idea, Rat.
That's the attitude.


290
00:16:15.923 --> 00:16:17.341
The attitude?
Yeah.


291
00:16:17.425 --> 00:16:18.843
The attitude dictates
that you don't care


292
00:16:18.926 --> 00:16:21.304
whether she comes,
stays, lays or prays.


293
00:16:21.387 --> 00:16:24.182
Whatever happens, your
toes are still tapping.


294
00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:28.644
Now, when you got that,
then you have the attitude.


295
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.064
Good night, Stacy.

296
00:16:32.148 --> 00:16:33.524
Good night, Mom.

297
00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:56.881
<i>Just look at that girl</i>

298
00:16:56.964 --> 00:17:00.593
<i>With lights coming up
in her eyes</i>


299
00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:06.432
<i>She's got to be
somebody's baby</i>


300
00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:10.686
<i>She must be
somebody's baby</i>


301
00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:13.064
You look beautiful.

302
00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:14.649
Thanks. So do you.

303
00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:18.736
Where do you
feel like going?


304
00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:19.946
I don't know.

305
00:17:20.446 --> 00:17:22.698
How about The Point?

306
00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:23.824
Okay.

307
00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:27.995
All right. The Point it is.

308
00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.873
<i>She's got to be
somebody's baby</i>


309
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.334
<i>She's so fine</i>

310
00:17:33.918 --> 00:17:37.964
<i>She's probably
somebody's only light</i>


311
00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:40.591
<i>Gonna shine tonight</i>

312
00:17:40.675 --> 00:17:42.176
Yeah

313
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:47.181
<i>She's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>


314
00:17:50.351 --> 00:17:54.272
<i>She's gonna be
somebody's only light</i>


315
00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:56.774
<i>Gonna shine tonight</i>

316
00:17:57.066 --> 00:17:58.609
Yeah

<i>She's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>


318
00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:17.169
That's a really
nice jacket.


319
00:18:17.253 --> 00:18:19.380
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.


320
00:18:25.928 --> 00:18:27.138
It's warm.

321
00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:29.098
Yeah, it is.
It's really warm.


322
00:18:29.223 --> 00:18:31.559
I wonder how long
it will last.


323
00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:36.939
So...

324
00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:41.861
Am I gonna
get to first base?


325
00:18:52.371 --> 00:18:53.664
Are you really 19?

326
00:18:53.748 --> 00:18:55.958
Yeah, yeah I am.
I'm really 19.


327
00:19:00.087 --> 00:19:04.925
<i>She's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>


328
00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:08.387
<i>I try to shut my eyes</i>

329
00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:11.474
<i>But I can't get her
out of my sight</i>


330
00:19:14.602 --> 00:19:16.604
<i>I know I'm gonna know it</i>

331
00:19:16.687 --> 00:19:19.774
<i>But I gotta get over my fright</i>

332
00:19:22.526 --> 00:19:25.196
<i>I'm just gonna walk up to her</i>

333
00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:29.158
<i>I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>

334
00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:41.212
<i>Gonna shine tonight</i>

335
00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:43.464
<i>Make her mine tonight</i>

336
00:19:43.547 --> 00:19:45.633
Yeah

337
00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:49.387
<i>Gonna shine tonight</i>

338
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.305
<i>Make her mine tonight</i>

339
00:19:53.474 --> 00:19:55.726
So tell me,
do you like Ron?


340
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.063
I like Ron,
but it hurt so bad.


341
00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:00.481
Don't worry.
Keep doing it.


342
00:20:00.564 --> 00:20:02.108
It gets a lot better.
I swear.


343
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:03.567
It better.

344
00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:06.529

00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:15.329

00:20:15.413 --> 00:20:17.581
<i>Raised on the radio</i>

349
00:20:18.332 --> 00:20:21.335
<i>Yeah, I was raised

Mom says
to clean the pool.


354
00:20:32.054 --> 00:20:33.222
Why can't you do it?

355
00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:35.933
Your friends use the pool.
Your friends messed it up.


356
00:20:36.016 --> 00:20:38.352
Your friends
use the pool, too.


357
00:20:38.436 --> 00:20:40.104
I take out the garbage.

358
00:20:53.534 --> 00:20:55.077
Brad!

359
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.957
Brad, have Mom and Dad
seen these?


360
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.250
They're not home yet.

361
00:21:02.376 --> 00:21:04.378
Brad?
What?


362
00:21:05.129 --> 00:21:06.797
What would you say
if I asked you


363
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:08.757
to put these in the trunk
of the Cruising Vessel


364
00:21:08.841 --> 00:21:10.259
and get rid of them?

365
00:21:10.342 --> 00:21:12.303
I'd say, "Who the
hell is Ron Johnson?"


366
00:21:12.386 --> 00:21:13.554
Please.

367
00:21:15.598 --> 00:21:17.391
Thank you very much.

368
00:21:19.894 --> 00:21:21.312
Lisa's great.

369
00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:22.521
Yeah.

370
00:21:22.855 --> 00:21:26.942
I don't understand why you want to
break up with a girl like that.


371
00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.404
Me and Lisa have been going
together for two years.


372
00:21:30.488 --> 00:21:31.989
I love her and all.

373
00:21:32.072 --> 00:21:34.241
I mean,
she's great in bed.


374
00:21:35.826 --> 00:21:39.538
It's just that I'm a
single, successful guy.


375
00:21:41.916 --> 00:21:44.668
And this is my
last year in school.


376
00:21:44.752 --> 00:21:46.670
This could be the
best year of my life!


377
00:21:47.922 --> 00:21:51.091
I just feel like I need
my freedom now, you know?


378
00:21:54.637 --> 00:21:56.931
Okay, here's your
preparation stuff.


379
00:21:57.014 --> 00:22:01.185
You got your sliced tomatoes,
shredded lettuce, secret sauce.


380
00:22:01.268 --> 00:22:02.353
What's the
secret sauce?


381
00:22:02.436 --> 00:22:04.021
Thousand Island
dressing.


382
00:22:04.104 --> 00:22:06.607
What's the secret sauce
of Bronco Burger?


383
00:22:06.732 --> 00:22:08.067
Ketchup
and mayonnaise.


384
00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.193
Gotcha.

385
00:22:09.276 --> 00:22:11.195
Order for you, Bradley.

386
00:22:13.572 --> 00:22:15.324
Were those flowers
really for me?


387
00:22:15.407 --> 00:22:16.617
Of course.

388
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.202
How much
did they cost?


389
00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:19.787
Don't worry about it.

390
00:22:20.454 --> 00:22:22.623
Want to go
to The Point tonight?


391
00:22:23.624 --> 00:22:25.501
What's there to do
at The Point?


392
00:22:25.584 --> 00:22:29.755
What do you mean? We've been going
out together for two years.


393
00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:33.300
I don't want to have to
use sex as a tool, Brad.


394
00:22:33.717 --> 00:22:37.972
Tool? Tool for what? We've been
going together for two years!


395
00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:39.682
I don't want to
talk about it here.


396
00:22:39.765 --> 00:22:41.350
I wanna talk about it!

397
00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:42.518
Brad?

398
00:22:42.601 --> 00:22:43.727
Lisa!

399
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:44.979
Brad!

400
00:22:45.896 --> 00:22:48.774
You gotta flip them
or they'll burn. Great.

Three weeks we've been talking
about the Platt Amendment.


406
00:23:03.706 --> 00:23:06.208
What are you people,
on dope?


407
00:23:07.084 --> 00:23:11.630
A piece of legislation was introduced
into Congress by Senator John Platt.


408
00:23:12.089 --> 00:23:15.092
It was passed in 1906.

409
00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:17.469
This amendment
to our Constitution


410
00:23:17.761 --> 00:23:20.514
has a profound impact
upon all of our...


411
00:23:20.889 --> 00:23:22.266
Where is Jeff Spicoli?

412
00:23:22.349 --> 00:23:24.685
I saw him earlier today near
the first floor bathrooms.


413
00:23:24.768 --> 00:23:28.731
Is he still on campus?
Anyone? Yes, Desmond?


414
00:23:29.732 --> 00:23:31.775
I saw him
by the food machines.


415
00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:32.860
How long ago?

416
00:23:32.943 --> 00:23:34.320
Right before class.

417
00:23:34.403 --> 00:23:36.363
Okay. Bring him in.

418
00:23:37.323 --> 00:23:39.992
What is this fascination
with truancy?


419
00:23:40.701 --> 00:23:43.787
What is it that gets
inside your heads?


420
00:23:44.705 --> 00:23:46.248
There are some teachers
in this school


421
00:23:46.332 --> 00:23:48.542
who look the other way
at truants.


422
00:23:48.626 --> 00:23:50.628
It's a little game
that you both play.


423
00:23:50.711 --> 00:23:53.589
They pretend they don't see you.
You pretend you don't ditoh.


424
00:23:53.672 --> 00:23:56.175
Now, who pays
the price later? You!


425
00:23:59.928 --> 00:24:02.640
Wait a minute. There's no
birthday party for me here!


426
00:24:05.851 --> 00:24:07.269
<i>Hola,</i> Mr. Hand.

427
00:24:07.645 --> 00:24:09.813
What's the reason
for your truancy?


428
00:24:10.648 --> 00:24:12.733
Just couldn't make it on time.

429
00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:15.653
You mean, you couldn't
or you wouldn't?


430
00:24:16.695 --> 00:24:19.448
It was like a full crowd
scene at the food lines.


431
00:24:19.531 --> 00:24:21.867
Food will be eaten
on your time.


432
00:24:22.576 --> 00:24:26.288
Why are you continuously late
for this class, Mr. Spiooli?


433
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:30.376
Why do you shamelessly
waste my time like this?


434
00:24:33.837 --> 00:24:35.297
I don't know.

435
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:57.528
I like that.

436
00:24:57.611 --> 00:25:01.115
"L don't know."
That's nice!


437
00:25:01.573 --> 00:25:03.534
"Mr. Hand,
will I pass this class?"


438
00:25:03.617 --> 00:25:06.578
"Gee, Mr. Spicoli,
I don't know!"


439
00:25:06.829 --> 00:25:09.540
That's nice. I really like that.
You know what I'm gonna do?


440
00:25:09.623 --> 00:25:13.585
I'm going to leave your words on this
board for all my olasses to enjoy.


441
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:16.797
Giving you full credit,
of course, Mr. Spicoli!


442
00:25:17.047 --> 00:25:18.424
All right.

443
00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:30.894
<i>Sleigh bells ring
are you listening</i>


444
00:25:30.978 --> 00:25:32.229
<i>In the lane</i>

<i>Snow is glistening</i>

00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:35.482
Oh, no!

<i>A beautiful sight,

How fucking long
do I have to wait?


451
00:25:47.244 --> 00:25:49.246
Christmas sucks.
I hate it.


452
00:25:49.329 --> 00:25:53.000
You gotta get used to working holidays.
People are always screaming.


453
00:25:53.083 --> 00:25:54.251
I have to quit this job.

454
00:25:54.334 --> 00:25:57.880
I'm gonna get so fat no one's
gonna want to take rne out.


455
00:25:58.213 --> 00:25:59.923
Ron hasn't called,
huh?


456
00:26:00.007 --> 00:26:01.717
Not since November.

457
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.302
What does it matter?

458
00:26:03.385 --> 00:26:04.595
He's a stereo salesman.

459
00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:07.389
VVhat'd you wanna do, marry him?
Have kids with him?


460
00:26:07.473 --> 00:26:10.309
Have this guy come home

461
00:26:10.809 --> 00:26:14.188
And have that little Pacific
Stereo sign on? Come on, Stace.


462
00:26:14.521 --> 00:26:16.273
Hey, it's his loss.

463
00:26:17.858 --> 00:26:19.860
Got any
Blue Oyster Cult?


464
00:26:20.235 --> 00:26:22.946
No, I don't have
any Blue Oyster Cult.


465
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.241
I ate 34 pairs last time.
Where were you?


466
00:26:26.366 --> 00:26:29.203
I was that close to working
at 7-11, you know?


467
00:26:29.286 --> 00:26:30.788
VVhoa,bud!

468
00:26:31.205 --> 00:26:32.873
What?

469
00:26:35.417 --> 00:26:36.710
All right!
Play me?


470
00:26:36.794 --> 00:26:37.878
Totally.

471
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.088
You got quarters?

472
00:26:44.218 --> 00:26:46.595
When are those Earth, Wind
and Fire tickets coming in?


473
00:26:46.678 --> 00:26:50.307
Earth, Wind and Fire? Geez,
I haven't heard anything.


474
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.309
The minute I
do, I'll let you know.


475
00:26:52.392 --> 00:26:54.728
I'm planning on taking
my little brother over here.


476
00:26:54.812 --> 00:26:58.232
Is that your little brother?
He's a good-looking kid.


477
00:26:58.315 --> 00:27:00.943
Great.
Charles Jefferson


478
00:27:01.026 --> 00:27:04.196
for Earth, Wind and Fire
and little brother.


479
00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:07.324
I'll let you know when
they come around, okay?


480
00:27:10.828 --> 00:27:12.496
Wow! Does he really
live here?


481
00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:14.832
I thought he just
flew in for games.


482
00:27:14.915 --> 00:27:17.918
Shit! He knows where to come
when he wants some tickets.


483
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.171
Go on. Get out of here. You're
messing up my business.


484
00:27:21.672 --> 00:27:24.383
Come on, Rat.
Let's go get you a woman.


485
00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:28.637
You ready for your
moment of truth?


486
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.598
Damone, I noticed I was starting
to get a pimple this morning...


487
00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:35.686
Rat, the shyness routine is
really starting to aggravate me.


488
00:27:35.894 --> 00:27:37.354
I mean, who is she,
anyway?


489
00:27:37.437 --> 00:27:40.023
She's a waitress
in a pizza parlor.


490
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.693
Look at her.
Look at you.


491
00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:44.444
A member
of the honor roll.


492
00:27:44.528 --> 00:27:47.698
Assistant to the assistant
manager of the movie theater.


493
00:27:47.781 --> 00:27:51.493
Rat, if this girl can't
smell your qualifications,


494
00:27:51.618 --> 00:27:53.412
then who needs her, right?
Right.


495
00:27:53.495 --> 00:27:54.788
All right.
How do you feel?


496
00:27:54.872 --> 00:27:55.873
Ifeelgood.

497
00:27:55.956 --> 00:27:59.585
Do you? All right. Now stop
fucking around and go get her.


498
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.714
Hey, Rat, you gotta
ace that jacket.


499
00:28:03.797 --> 00:28:04.840
Yeah?

500
00:28:04.923 --> 00:28:06.341
Yeah. All right,
that's cool.


501
00:28:06.425 --> 00:28:09.261
You look good.
All right? Go get her.


502
00:28:15.142 --> 00:28:18.103
$1.10, and you get
five cents back.


503
00:28:19.688 --> 00:28:20.898
Thanks.

504
00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:23.650
Hi. Don't I know you
from biology class?


505
00:28:23.734 --> 00:28:24.735
Yeah.

506
00:28:24.985 --> 00:28:26.737
What can I do for you?

507
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.990
I had a couple ofquesfions.
I was curious.


508
00:28:30.157 --> 00:28:32.701
What do you do with the
jackets people leave here?


509
00:28:32.784 --> 00:28:33.994
We keep them.

510
00:28:34.077 --> 00:28:35.162
You keep them?

511
00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:39.124
In case they come back. You can
look through it if you want.


512
00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:43.128
No, that's cool. It would take too
long to look through all that.


513
00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:45.172
I'll pick up
a new one.


514
00:28:47.507 --> 00:28:49.176
What was your
other question?


515
00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:51.386
Oh, my other question is

516
00:28:53.639 --> 00:28:56.934
can I have your phone number
so I can ask you out sometime?


517
00:28:57.768 --> 00:28:59.645
Do you have a pen?
This one's out of ink.


518
00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:00.979
Yeah.

519
00:29:12.115 --> 00:29:16.495
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy.
My name is Mark Ratner.


520
00:29:18.205 --> 00:29:19.706
I've gotta go.

521
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.935
Lisa, I have something
to tell you.


522
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.314
Look,
I'm a senior now.


523
00:29:45.607 --> 00:29:47.818
I'm a single,
successful guy.


524
00:29:49.861 --> 00:29:51.655
And I've got to
be fair to myself.


525
00:29:51.738 --> 00:29:52.948
Lisa,

526
00:29:53.907 --> 00:29:55.993
I think
I need my freedom.


527
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:02.499
Oh, don't do that.

528
00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:04.167
Please,
please don't do that.


529
00:30:04.251 --> 00:30:05.252
Brad!

530
00:30:05.335 --> 00:30:07.337
Can you cover me
on register two?


531
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:08.588
Okay.

532
00:30:13.093 --> 00:30:15.012
May I help you?
Yes.


533
00:30:15.095 --> 00:30:17.514
This is not the best
breakfast I ever ate and...


534
00:30:17.597 --> 00:30:18.598
I'd like my money back.

535
00:30:18.682 --> 00:30:19.725
Okay.

536
00:30:19.808 --> 00:30:22.102
I believe you have to
fill out a form.


537
00:30:22.477 --> 00:30:24.312
No. I'd like my money
back now.


538
00:30:24.396 --> 00:30:28.358
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.
I have to fill out a form.


539
00:30:28.483 --> 00:30:30.861
Well, you ate
most of it already so...


540
00:30:30.944 --> 00:30:33.989
See that sign?
It says "100% guaranteed."


541
00:30:34.072 --> 00:30:35.782
You know what the meaning
of guarantee is?


542
00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:36.867
Did they
teach you that here?


543
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.161
Sir, if you'd just
wait a minute.


544
00:30:39.244 --> 00:30:42.539
Look. Just put your little
hand in the cash register


545
00:30:42.622 --> 00:30:46.626
and give me my $2.75 back,
please, Brad.


546
00:30:46.877 --> 00:30:49.546
Sir, if you'd just give me a minute.
I'll find the forms.


547
00:30:49.629 --> 00:30:51.048
I'll take care of everything.

548
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:54.092
I don't have a minute.
You've made me late enough.


549
00:30:54.259 --> 00:30:57.012
lam so tired of dealing
with incompetence.


550
00:30:57.095 --> 00:31:00.432
It says 100% guaranteed,
you moron!


551
00:31:00.682 --> 00:31:04.686
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm
gonna kiok 100% of your ass.


552
00:31:05.353 --> 00:31:08.190
Is there a problem here?
Can I help you, sir?


553
00:31:08.273 --> 00:31:09.566
You bet
you have a problem.


554
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:12.736
Your employee used profanity and
threatened me with violence.


555
00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:14.738
I'm surprised. I eat
here all the time


556
00:31:14.821 --> 00:31:16.865
and usually have
good service.


557
00:31:16.948 --> 00:31:19.493
All I wanted was my money
back on this breakfast.


558
00:31:19.576 --> 00:31:21.161
It was a little
under-cooked.


559
00:31:21.244 --> 00:31:24.790
And he threatens me with violence.
I'm gonna call your...


560
00:31:24.873 --> 00:31:26.792
I can take care of it.

561
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:31.713
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this
customer or use profanity in any way?


562
00:31:35.342 --> 00:31:38.136
He insulted me first. He
called me a moron, Dennis.


563
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.973
Answer rne! Did you threaten
this customer or use profanity?


564
00:31:42.516 --> 00:31:43.600
Yes.

565
00:31:43.683 --> 00:31:45.102
You're fired.

566
00:31:45.185 --> 00:31:48.480
I'm very sorry, sir. I'll
refund your money right now.


567
00:31:48.563 --> 00:31:50.232
I hope you won't
hold this against us.


568
00:31:50.315 --> 00:31:53.026
You know how these young
kids are these days.


569
00:31:53.193 --> 00:31:55.529
Here we are.
Perhaps another breakfast?


570
00:31:55.737 --> 00:31:58.532
I hope you had
a hell of a piss, Arnold!


571
00:32:05.914 --> 00:32:08.291
<i>The world's
finest surfers showed up today</i>


572
00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:09.918
<i>to do battle with
what's turned out to be</i>


573
00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:13.463
<i>the biggest waves
to hit this coast since 1946.</i>


574
00:32:13.547 --> 00:32:16.508
Hello. I'm Stu Nahan, and I'd
like you to meet this young man.


575
00:32:16.591 --> 00:32:20.011
His name, Jeff Spicoli.
Jeff, congratulations.


576
00:32:20.095 --> 00:32:21.513
Things looked rough
out there today.


577
00:32:22.722 --> 00:32:26.143
I'll tell you, Stu, I did battle
with some humongous waves.


578
00:32:26.226 --> 00:32:31.064
Just like I told the guy on
ABC, "Danger is my business."


579
00:32:31.273 --> 00:32:33.984
A lot of people expected
Mark "Cutback" Davis,


580
00:32:34.067 --> 00:32:37.154
or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard would
take the honors this year.


581
00:32:37.237 --> 00:32:39.406
Those guys are fags!

582
00:32:39.489 --> 00:32:41.366
That's fantastic.
Let me ask you.


583
00:32:41.449 --> 00:32:43.577
When you get out there, do
you ever fear for your life?


584
00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:48.248
Stu, surfing's not a sport. It's
a way of life. It's no hobby.


585
00:32:48.498 --> 00:32:53.086
It's a way of looking at that wave
and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party!"


586
00:32:54.129 --> 00:32:55.755
Where'd you get
this jacket?


587
00:32:55.839 --> 00:32:59.759
From the network. Let me ask you,
what's next for Jeff Spicoli?


588
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:03.471
Headed over to the Australian and
then the Hawaiian Internationals.


589
00:33:03.555 --> 00:33:08.268
Then rne and Mick are gonna wing on
over to London and jam with the Stones.


590
00:33:09.436 --> 00:33:11.479
You guys
are invited, too.


591
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.398
Jeff! Jeff!

592
00:33:14.608 --> 00:33:18.111
Jeff, Dad says
you have to get up.


593
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.947
Leave rne alone. Dad says
you're gonna be late again,


594
00:33:21.031 --> 00:33:22.157
you butthole!

595
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.533
Leave me alone!

596
00:33:23.617 --> 00:33:26.328
Dad says you're gonna be
late again, you booger!


597
00:33:26.453 --> 00:33:28.914
Dad, Jeff threw
his snorkel at me!


598
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:35.337
We just want to say that we're
not Spirit Bunnies anymore.


599
00:33:35.503 --> 00:33:39.007
We always hated that name. It
bugged the heck out of Dina and me.


600
00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.508
It's just
such a put-down!


601
00:33:40.592 --> 00:33:41.635
Really!

602
00:33:42.469 --> 00:33:45.680
We know you've got a lot of
spirit, everybody, right?


603
00:33:45.764 --> 00:33:49.142
And we're gonna destroy
Lincoln next week! All right!


604
00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:56.650
You know, it takes a lot
of courage to get up here


605
00:33:56.816 --> 00:33:59.486
and do something that you
know people will make fun of.


606
00:33:59.569 --> 00:34:01.029
Yeah.
Man...


607
00:34:02.656 --> 00:34:05.325
I'm never gonna talk
to those guys again.


608
00:34:05.408 --> 00:34:06.660
I'm the one who
got Arnold and Dave


609
00:34:06.743 --> 00:34:08.954
their jobs there
in the first place.


610
00:34:09.037 --> 00:34:12.249
If you'd apologize to Dennis,
I'm sure he'd take you back.


611
00:34:12.332 --> 00:34:15.919
Fuck Dennis Taylor! I'm not
gonna apologize to that wimp.


612
00:34:19.214 --> 00:34:21.424
I'm just glad
we're still together


613
00:34:21.508 --> 00:34:25.178
because a lot's happened, and
I really need you this year.


614
00:34:26.054 --> 00:34:30.350
Look, Brad, I've been trying to
think of a way to tell you this.


615
00:34:32.269 --> 00:34:35.480
We're almost out of school.
It's our last year.


616
00:34:36.273 --> 00:34:40.443
And I think we owe it
to ourselves to be free.


617
00:34:41.653 --> 00:34:43.822
To go out
with other people.


618
00:34:46.616 --> 00:34:48.743
I still want
to be friends.


619
00:34:49.828 --> 00:34:52.455
What do I say to her
once we get in the car?


620
00:34:52.539 --> 00:34:56.918
No problem, Rat. What you need
is my special five-point plan.


621
00:34:57.002 --> 00:34:59.170
Come on, Damone,
I need real help.


622
00:34:59.296 --> 00:35:00.463
What do you mean?

623
00:35:00.547 --> 00:35:04.426
Men have died trying to obtain
this valuable information.


624
00:35:04.884 --> 00:35:06.636
But I'll give it to you
for free.


625
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.055
What's your
five-point plan?


626
00:35:09.556 --> 00:35:13.059
All right.
Now, pay attention.


627
00:35:14.561 --> 00:35:19.232
First of all, you never let
on how much you like a girl.


628
00:35:19.774 --> 00:35:22.235
Oh, Debbie. Hi.

629
00:35:23.737 --> 00:35:26.281
Two. You always
call the shots.


630
00:35:26.698 --> 00:35:29.242
Kiss me,
you won't regret it.


631
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:34.789
Three. Act like wherever you
are, that's the place to be.


632
00:35:35.957 --> 00:35:37.959
Isn't this great?

633
00:35:38.543 --> 00:35:39.627
Four

634
00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:42.922
When ordering food, you
find out what she wants


635
00:35:43.006 --> 00:35:44.549
then order
for the both of you.


636
00:35:44.632 --> 00:35:46.176
It's a classy move.

637
00:35:46.259 --> 00:35:49.095
Thelady will have the linguine
in a white clam sauce,


638
00:35:49.179 --> 00:35:51.097
and a Coke with no ice.

639
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.183
And five.

640
00:35:53.516 --> 00:35:55.935
Now, this is
most important, Rat.


641
00:35:56.978 --> 00:36:00.690
When it comes down to making
out, whenever possible,


642
00:36:01.524 --> 00:36:04.277
<i>put on side one
of Led Zeppelin I V.</i>


643
00:36:14.662 --> 00:36:16.331
This is a nice car.

644
00:36:16.414 --> 00:36:17.874
Yeah. It's my sister's.

645
00:36:17.957 --> 00:36:19.084
Yeah?

646
00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:24.464
Do you have
Mrs. George for English?


647
00:36:24.547 --> 00:36:26.091
Yeah.
She's pretty good.


648
00:36:26.174 --> 00:36:28.176
Yeah, she is pretty good.

649
00:36:36.017 --> 00:36:37.560
Have you decided?

650
00:36:37.644 --> 00:36:40.021
Um, yeah.

651
00:36:40.105 --> 00:36:42.816
I'll have
the knockwurst.


652
00:36:44.484 --> 00:36:45.860
ExceHenL

653
00:36:46.319 --> 00:36:48.154
You work at
Cinema Four, right?


654
00:36:48.238 --> 00:36:51.366
That must be great. You get
to see all those free movies.


655
00:36:51.449 --> 00:36:53.493
You get free popcorn.

656
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.703
Are you okay?

657
00:36:55.787 --> 00:36:56.913
Yeah, I'm fine.

658
00:36:57.872 --> 00:37:00.583
Would you mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?


659
00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:02.210
Oh, no, go ahead.

660
00:37:02.293 --> 00:37:04.462
Are you ready
to order here?


661
00:37:07.799 --> 00:37:09.467
She will have
the knockwurst.


662
00:37:09.551 --> 00:37:10.927
And you?

663
00:37:13.138 --> 00:37:14.931
I'll have the same.

664
00:37:15.014 --> 00:37:16.182
Anything to drink?

665
00:37:16.391 --> 00:37:17.434
Coke.

666
00:37:17.517 --> 00:37:18.601
Two Cokes.

667
00:37:19.394 --> 00:37:21.354
Okay. Thank you.

668
00:37:23.189 --> 00:37:24.274
I'll be right back.

669
00:37:24.357 --> 00:37:25.483
Okay.

670
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:33.533
Hello?
Mike, it's Mark.


671
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.118
What happened to your date?

672
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:36.536
<i>MARK".
It's happening right now.</i>


673
00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:38.288
<i>Everything's fine except</i>

674
00:37:39.539 --> 00:37:41.624
I left my wallet at home.

675
00:37:41.708 --> 00:37:43.001
Why don't you
go home and get it?


676
00:37:43.084 --> 00:37:46.212
No, I can't! I'm here. The
food's coming and everything.


677
00:37:46.296 --> 00:37:50.258
Look, would you do me a favor?
Just borrow your mom's oar.


678
00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:53.636
Drive to my house, get my
wallet and bring it here.


679
00:37:56.723 --> 00:37:58.141
Hello? Mike?

680
00:37:58.391 --> 00:37:59.517
<i>Mike?</i>

681
00:38:00.852 --> 00:38:03.688
Geez, I'm really
kind of busy, Rat.


682
00:38:03.771 --> 00:38:05.440
Just do me this one favor.

683
00:38:05.523 --> 00:38:08.610
I swear I won't ask you for anything
again in this lifetime or any other.


684
00:38:08.693 --> 00:38:10.487
But just please
do this for me.


685
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.739
You owe me for this one.

686
00:38:13.281 --> 00:38:15.658
Okay, thanks.
Thanks a lot. Thanks.


687
00:38:15.742 --> 00:38:17.952
<i>Beaver,
are you all right?</i>


688
00:38:18.536 --> 00:38:19.913
What happened?

689
00:38:27.921 --> 00:38:30.924
Are you sure there's nothing
else I oan bring you?


690
00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:32.717
Do you want
another Coke?


691
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.261
Um, okay.

692
00:38:36.596 --> 00:38:39.307
Two more Cokes.

693
00:38:40.099 --> 00:38:41.935
Hey, Mark,
is that you?


694
00:38:42.018 --> 00:38:43.186
Yeah, hi.

695
00:38:43.269 --> 00:38:44.270
You come here?

696
00:38:44.354 --> 00:38:46.648
Yeah. I come for the strudel.
It's great.


697
00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:49.025
Hey, listen, I found your
wallet the other day.


698
00:38:49.108 --> 00:38:51.569
You want it back?
Oh, wow! Yeah.


699
00:38:51.653 --> 00:38:53.613
I was looking for this.

700
00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:56.658
Oh, Mike, you don't
know Stacy Hamilton.


701
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:58.618
Stacy,
this is Mike Damone.


702
00:38:58.701 --> 00:39:00.453
Hi.
Hi.


703
00:39:00.703 --> 00:39:02.539
Nice to meet you.

704
00:39:04.123 --> 00:39:05.625
See you later.

705
00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:08.503
Right. Gotta be going.
See you later.


706
00:39:11.965 --> 00:39:15.260
You wanna go?
Yeah.


707
00:39:28.815 --> 00:39:30.233
I had a really
nice time tonight.


708
00:39:30.316 --> 00:39:31.484
Me, too.

709
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.029
I'm real sorry someone broke
in and stole your tape deck.


710
00:39:35.113 --> 00:39:37.865
Ineverthcught it would've
happened at such a fancy place.


711
00:39:37.949 --> 00:39:40.868
I know. You want to
come in for a sec?


712
00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:45.456
Okay, sure.
Good.


713
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:54.132
Where's your brother?

714
00:39:54.215 --> 00:39:55.925
He's out tonight
with some friends.


715
00:39:56.009 --> 00:39:57.051
Can I get you
something to drink?


716
00:39:57.135 --> 00:39:58.928
No, that's okay.

717
00:39:59.012 --> 00:40:02.932
Oh. Well, would you mind
iflchange?


718
00:40:04.183 --> 00:40:05.226
No.

719
00:40:05.768 --> 00:40:09.022
Okay. Could you get this for me?
It always sticks.


720
00:40:16.362 --> 00:40:17.572
Thanks.

721
00:40:25.371 --> 00:40:27.123
Where are your parents?

722
00:40:28.124 --> 00:40:30.543
My parents are out of
town for the weekend.


723
00:40:30.627 --> 00:40:33.087
Brad and I are
watching the house.


724
00:40:34.088 --> 00:40:35.632
This is a really
nice picture of you.


725
00:40:35.715 --> 00:40:36.799
Thanks.

726
00:40:36.883 --> 00:40:39.135
You can come in my room
if you want.


727
00:40:49.395 --> 00:40:51.522
So, what do you
want to do?


728
00:40:52.065 --> 00:40:53.566
I don't know.

729
00:40:54.233 --> 00:40:55.401
Um...

730
00:40:56.444 --> 00:40:57.987
You want to look
at a photo album?


731
00:40:58.071 --> 00:41:01.407
I keep a lot of pictures from
when I grew up and stuff.


732
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:02.492
It's kind of
stupid, huh?


733
00:41:02.575 --> 00:41:03.660
Sure. Yeah.

734
00:41:03.743 --> 00:41:05.411
Yeah? Great.

735
00:41:09.415 --> 00:41:10.833
Photographs.

736
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:14.754
This is the one
that Brad took.


737
00:41:14.837 --> 00:41:17.924
It's like double-image type thing,
you know. It's like a mirror.


738
00:41:18.007 --> 00:41:20.218
This is me being stupid.

739
00:41:21.803 --> 00:41:25.098
And this is my dog Gypsy,
and my cat Tullio.


740
00:41:25.515 --> 00:41:27.141
They're dead now.

741
00:41:27.225 --> 00:41:29.102
Remember him?
Mr. Degan?


742

<i>You had Began'?</i>

The same suit!


744
00:41:33.606 --> 00:41:35.066
He must've had

745
00:41:35.149 --> 00:41:36.401
He was terrible!

746
00:41:36.484 --> 00:41:38.444
No, I think it was one.

747
00:41:40.363 --> 00:41:44.409

<i>Yeah, love rules</i>

You know, I just
thought of something.


753
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.641
What?

754
00:42:09.517 --> 00:42:12.603
My sister is crazy
when it comes to her car.


755
00:42:12.729 --> 00:42:14.897
It's gotta be back by 11:00.
VVant to call her?


756
00:42:14.981 --> 00:42:18.693
No.Look,LH
She gets crazy.


757
00:42:18.776 --> 00:42:22.363
Her car is her baby.
I better be going.


758
00:42:22.447 --> 00:42:23.948
Really?
I'll call you.


759
00:42:24.031 --> 00:42:26.492
Well, I'll see you

Mark Ratner doesn't like you?
You're crazy!


764
00:42:59.233 --> 00:43:02.111
No, he shows absolutely
no interest in me.


765
00:43:02.361 --> 00:43:06.532
Mark Ratner is definitely somebody you'd
have to make the first move with.


766
00:43:06.616 --> 00:43:10.369
Linda, I did. I made the first
move, I made the second move.


767
00:43:10.703 --> 00:43:13.289
I made a complete jerk out
of myself, is what I did.

What do you care
about Mark Ratner for?


769
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:18.044
He's a 16-year-old usher
in the movie theater.


770
00:43:18.419 --> 00:43:22.548
You have dated older guys. You work
at the best food stand in the mall.


771
00:43:22.632 --> 00:43:25.593
And you are a close
personal friend of mine.


772
00:43:27.136 --> 00:43:30.723
Yeah. But I was really
beginning to like him.


773

better find somebody else fast.

my brother's car.


781
00:44:11.806 --> 00:44:12.974
You said
he was out of town.


782
00:44:13.057 --> 00:44:14.183
And he is.

783
00:44:14.267 --> 00:44:16.644
All right.
Then don't hassle it.


784
00:44:31.993 --> 00:44:34.620
You're crazy, Spicoli!
That light was red!


785
00:44:34.704 --> 00:44:37.039
It was yellow a minute ago.
I'm sure.


786
00:44:37.123 --> 00:44:39.208
Hey, you're gonna
scratch my brother's car.


787
00:44:40.001 --> 00:44:42.712
No, I'm not.

788
00:44:42.795 --> 00:44:46.340
Look, I'm driving.
You navigate.


789
00:44:48.092 --> 00:44:50.636
Where is this party?

790
00:44:51.512 --> 00:44:54.056
Make a right, right here.
Here! Here! Here!


791
00:45:11.198 --> 00:45:14.327
My brother's gonna kill us!
He's gonna kill us!


792
00:45:14.744 --> 00:45:18.039
He's gonna kill you. He's gonna kill rne.
He's gonna kill us!


793
00:45:18.789 --> 00:45:21.375
Hey, man, just be glad
I had fast reflexes.


794
00:45:21.459 --> 00:45:23.085
My brother's gonna shit!

795
00:45:23.169 --> 00:45:24.587
Make up your mind, dude.

796
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.631
Is he gonna shit
or is he gonna kill us?


797
00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:30.009
First he's gonna shit,
then he's gonna kill us!


798
00:45:30.343 --> 00:45:32.762
Relax, all right?

799
00:45:32.845 --> 00:45:35.681
My old man is a
television repairman.


800
00:45:35.765 --> 00:45:40.186
He's got this ultimate set of tools.
I can fix it!


801
00:45:40.269 --> 00:45:42.980
You can't fix
this car, Spicoli!


802
00:45:46.984 --> 00:45:48.319
I can fix it.

803
00:45:48.402 --> 00:45:49.528
Ha.

804
00:45:58.871 --> 00:46:00.539
Hey!

805
00:46:10.716 --> 00:46:13.260
I'm giving you $50.
No,no,no!


806
00:46:13.344 --> 00:46:16.305
That means if you win,
I give you $25.


807
00:46:16.389 --> 00:46:18.391
If I Win,
you give me $5.


808
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:21.644
You can't lose.
All right.


809
00:46:21.727 --> 00:46:23.437
I'll put you down
for $5.


810
00:46:23.521 --> 00:46:26.524
Now, don't forget about
the 14-point spread.


811
00:46:28.067 --> 00:46:30.194
Fourteen-point...

812
00:46:32.613 --> 00:46:36.075
I don't believe those guys at
Lincoln did this to Jefferson's oar!


813
00:46:36.826 --> 00:46:39.954
They totaled it.
I can't believe it.


814
00:46:43.165 --> 00:46:46.335
Jefferson's gonna really
make Lincoln pay for this.


815
00:46:46.419 --> 00:46:49.296
That guy's gonna
totally destroy them.


816
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.465
Annihilate.
You know what I mean?


817
00:46:54.593 --> 00:46:57.304
Shit, he is pissed off.

818
00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:18.951
<i>They may well mean
what they say about you</i>


819
00:47:19.035 --> 00:47:22.455
<i>You might wander back
to future friends</i>


820
00:47:23.914 --> 00:47:26.667
<i>You may want someone
just to talk to</i>


821
00:47:28.794 --> 00:47:32.673
<i>Come too close
and take you by the hand</i>


822
00:47:33.299 --> 00:47:38.220
<i>'Cause now you see there's more
to life than what we lovers do</i>


823
00:47:39.472 --> 00:47:42.183
Oh, shit!
Hut. Hut.


824
00:47:50.149 --> 00:47:54.153
<i>Brought down again by 33,
Charles Jefferson.</i>


825
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.990
<i>Hit by Jefferson.
Crunched by Jefferson.</i>


826
00:47:58.074 --> 00:48:02.787
<i>Man! Jefferson. Jefferson.
Jefferson. Jefferson.</i>


827
00:48:03.662 --> 00:48:05.498
<i>Jefferson.</i>

828
00:48:06.332 --> 00:48:07.917
Stretcher!

829
00:48:11.837 --> 00:48:14.298
<i>Again by Jefferson.</i>

830
00:48:21.806 --> 00:48:25.851
Five, four,
three, two, one!


831
00:48:30.689 --> 00:48:32.942
There's nothing to eat here.
What do you mean?


832
00:48:33.025 --> 00:48:34.527
Take a look. There's
nothing I can eat.


833
00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.861
Get a trout dog.

834
00:48:35.945 --> 00:48:38.364
Forget it. Do you have any
fish here that isn't breaded?


835
00:48:38.447 --> 00:48:40.366
It's all prepared
the same way.


836
00:48:40.449 --> 00:48:41.492
Get a whaler.

837
00:48:41.575 --> 00:48:43.577
Or a clamwich.

838
00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:46.080
Ever hear the word blemish? VVant
me to eat something deep fried?


839
00:48:46.163 --> 00:48:47.248
Let's get out of here.

840
00:48:47.331 --> 00:48:48.499
Let's go.

841
00:48:51.001 --> 00:48:53.671
Thank you. Come again,
and have a nice day.


842
00:48:56.882 --> 00:48:58.968
I sent a letter
to Doug today.


843
00:48:59.051 --> 00:49:00.344
Can't wait until
he gets out here.


844
00:49:00.427 --> 00:49:02.304
What's Doug doing
in Chicago?


845
00:49:02.388 --> 00:49:04.932
He works for the airline.
You'll meet him.


846
00:49:05.015 --> 00:49:07.393
Oh, Linda,
you have to do this.


847
00:49:07.476 --> 00:49:08.519
What?

848
00:49:08.602 --> 00:49:10.020
"Rate Your Mate."

849
00:49:10.104 --> 00:49:11.564
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.


850
00:49:11.647 --> 00:49:14.108
Let me test Doug.
Okay.


851
00:49:14.191 --> 00:49:16.527
"Most satisfactory
love making occurs,


852
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:18.529
"A, when your mate
climaxes first.


853
00:49:18.612 --> 00:49:22.158
"B, when you climax first. C, you
and your mate climax together?"


854
00:49:22.241 --> 00:49:24.034
Climax together.

855
00:49:24.743 --> 00:49:26.787
This is gonna
be great, Rat.


856
00:49:27.413 --> 00:49:29.498
It's like the highlight
of their day.


857
00:49:29.582 --> 00:49:30.708
Maybe we ought
to call first.


858
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:32.209
I don't know about
dropping in like this.


859
00:49:32.293 --> 00:49:34.670
Are you kidding? We're
gonna surprise them.


860
00:49:34.753 --> 00:49:37.006
Just fix your collar,
all right?


861
00:49:37.089 --> 00:49:40.593
Relax. Just be cool.
Attitude, remember?


862
00:49:40.718 --> 00:49:41.927
Where'd you get that,
out of the hamper?


863
00:49:42.011 --> 00:49:43.637
Hey,
this is clean.


864
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:45.347
Look, friend,
it's like riding a bike.


865
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:46.974
You fall off,
you get right back on.


866
00:49:47.057 --> 00:49:49.268
You mess up a date,
do it again!


867
00:49:50.269 --> 00:49:52.938
Do you always climax with Doug?
Yes.


868
00:49:55.024 --> 00:49:58.861
I think so.
He's no high school boy.


869
00:50:00.571 --> 00:50:01.947
DAMONEI Hey!

870
00:50:02.031 --> 00:50:04.241
Came over to help you
with your math homework.


871
00:50:04.325 --> 00:50:06.827
You could use it
on such a hot day.


872
00:50:07.828 --> 00:50:10.706
Don't worry.
They're gonna let us in.


873
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:12.958
Okay.

874
00:50:18.464 --> 00:50:21.759
Promise you're going to leave
as soon as my mother gets home.


875
00:50:21.842 --> 00:50:23.093
Okay.

876
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.888
Linda, this is
Mike and Mark.


877
00:50:25.971 --> 00:50:27.640
Hi, how you doing?
Good.


878
00:50:28.265 --> 00:50:31.310
The water looks great.
Check it out. Yeah.


879
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.523
Looks fine. Wait.

880
00:50:38.692 --> 00:50:41.195
Very funny! Very funny!

881
00:50:49.036 --> 00:50:50.120
Lin, come in!

882
00:50:50.204 --> 00:50:51.497
I'll judge your dive.

883
00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.166
I used to be
a champion, you know.


884
00:51:06.345 --> 00:51:08.264
Does Mom know
you have company?


885
00:51:08.347 --> 00:51:10.349
It's just Mark and Mike
from school.


886
00:51:10.432 --> 00:51:12.810
Hi.
How you doing?


887
00:51:12.893 --> 00:51:14.853
Hi, Linda.
Hi, Brad.


888
00:51:18.232 --> 00:51:22.569
Could you keep it down?
I have work to do inside.


889
00:51:22.653 --> 00:51:24.280
Okay.

890
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.949
Who's his tailor?

891
00:51:27.032 --> 00:51:29.827
God, he hardly talks anymore.

892
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:32.955
Yeah, I know.
He hates wearing a uniform.


893
00:51:33.038 --> 00:51:36.083
Rat, show them how
you can stand up underwater.


894
00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:37.251
Come on.

895
00:51:40.796 --> 00:51:43.299
What are you doing?
Watch out, Rat!


896
00:51:43.382 --> 00:51:45.301
Leave me alone!

897
00:51:45.384 --> 00:51:47.928
All right, Damone,
you're gonna get it.


898
00:52:03.569 --> 00:52:06.196
Hi, Brad.

899
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.074
You know how cute
I always thought you were.


900
00:52:47.112 --> 00:52:50.324
Stacy, do you have Q-tips?
I've got water in my ears.


901
00:52:50.407 --> 00:52:52.826
I don't know.
Check in the house.


902
00:52:58.457 --> 00:53:01.001
Wait. Just a minute.

903
00:53:05.881 --> 00:53:08.384
Doesn't anybody
fucking knock anymore?


904
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.944
In 1898, Spain
owned Cuba outright.


905
00:53:27.027 --> 00:53:28.487
Think about it.

906
00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:33.242
Cuba owned by a disorganized
parliament 4,000 miles away.


907
00:53:33.492 --> 00:53:36.662
Cubans were in a constant...

908
00:53:40.791 --> 00:53:43.460
Cubans were in
a constant state of revolt.


909
00:53:43.544 --> 00:53:45.295
In 1904,

910
00:53:45.379 --> 00:53:49.508
the United States decided to
throw a little weight around...


911
00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:53.595
Who is it?

912
00:53:53.679 --> 00:53:54.888
Mr. Pizza Guy.

913
00:53:54.972 --> 00:53:55.931
Again?

914
00:53:56.014 --> 00:53:57.349
Mr. Pizza Guy, sir.

915
00:54:03.105 --> 00:54:05.441
Who ordered the double
cheese and sausage?


916
00:54:05.524 --> 00:54:06.650
Right here, dude.

917
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:16.702
Foryou,dude.

918
00:54:24.877 --> 00:54:28.839
Am I hallucinating? What in the
hell do you think you're doing?


919
00:54:28.922 --> 00:54:31.341
Learning about Cuba
and having some food.


920
00:54:31.425 --> 00:54:33.844
Mr. Spicoli, you're on
dangerous ground.


921
00:54:33.927 --> 00:54:36.889
You're causing a major
disturbance on my time.


922
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.517
I've been thinking
about this, Mr. Hand.


923
00:54:40.601 --> 00:54:44.897
If I'm here and you're here,
doesn't that make it "our" time?


924
00:54:45.397 --> 00:54:48.734
There's nothing wrong
with a feast on "our" time.


925
00:54:48.817 --> 00:54:53.238
You're absolutely right, Mr.
Spicoli. It is our time.


926
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:57.284
Yours, mine and everyone
else's in this room.


927
00:54:57.367 --> 00:54:58.911
But it is my class.

928
00:54:58.994 --> 00:55:02.748
Hamilton, Brandt,
Cornfeld, up front!


929
00:55:02.956 --> 00:55:05.709
Mr. Spicoli has been kind
enough to bring us a snack.


930
00:55:05.792 --> 00:55:08.879
Be my guest.
Help yourselves.


931
00:55:10.047 --> 00:55:11.381
Get a good one.

932
00:55:18.764 --> 00:55:20.766
Mike?
Mike? Hi.


933
00:55:20.849 --> 00:55:22.184
Hi.
How you doing?


934
00:55:22.267 --> 00:55:23.685
Good.
How are you?


935
00:55:23.769 --> 00:55:27.064
I hate walking. I have to walk every day.
It's such a drag.


936
00:55:27.147 --> 00:55:29.316
Why don't you get a
ride with somebody?


937
00:55:29.399 --> 00:55:32.611
Sometimes I ride with my
brother, but he works mornings.


938
00:55:32.694 --> 00:55:34.154
Then he drives
himself to school.


939
00:55:34.238 --> 00:55:35.739
What a guy.

940
00:55:36.281 --> 00:55:40.202
Listen, Mark Ratner
really likes you.


941
00:55:40.619 --> 00:55:42.162
Do you like him?

942
00:55:42.246 --> 00:55:43.830
Mark is really nice.

943
00:55:45.332 --> 00:55:47.125
But I think I like you.

944
00:55:58.387 --> 00:56:02.349
Well, this is me.

945
00:56:03.475 --> 00:56:04.851
Do you have
any iced tea?


946
00:56:04.935 --> 00:56:06.144
Yeah, sure.

947
00:56:06.228 --> 00:56:08.188
Come on in.

948
00:56:11.108 --> 00:56:13.735
The annuals are
coming out pretty soon.


949
00:56:13.819 --> 00:56:15.571
You gonna get one?

950
00:56:15.654 --> 00:56:17.072
I don't know.

951
00:56:17.447 --> 00:56:18.740
Oh, come on.

952
00:56:19.658 --> 00:56:22.452
Aren't you curious to see how
your picture turned out?


953
00:56:22.536 --> 00:56:24.037
I know what I look like.

954
00:56:24.121 --> 00:56:25.581
I know.

955
00:56:25.664 --> 00:56:28.417
But it's nice to have pictures
of your friends and stuff.


956
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.378
I don't know. Maybe.
It's no big deal.


957
00:56:31.962 --> 00:56:34.298
I probably will.

958
00:56:34.798 --> 00:56:36.717
Must be nice having a pool.

959
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.926
You want to go swimming?

960
00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:39.011
Yeah, sure.

961
00:56:39.136 --> 00:56:42.097
I'm going to go change, okay?
Yeah.


962
00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.515
Okay, great.

963
00:56:54.026 --> 00:56:55.986
This is great iced tea.

964
00:56:59.698 --> 00:57:01.241
Come on.
Huh?


965
00:57:01.325 --> 00:57:03.702
Brad keeps his stuff
in the change room.


966
00:57:15.631 --> 00:57:17.549
This is nice.
Yeah?


967
00:57:17.633 --> 00:57:19.635
Yeah.

968
00:57:19.718 --> 00:57:21.011
These'll fit you.

969
00:57:34.441 --> 00:57:35.734
You're really
a good kisser.


970
00:57:35.817 --> 00:57:37.611
Yeah?

971
00:57:37.694 --> 00:57:39.196
So are you.

972
00:57:47.162 --> 00:57:49.498
You want to take off
your clothes, Mike?


973
00:57:49.581 --> 00:57:51.083
You first.

974
00:57:52.542 --> 00:57:54.378
Both of us
at the same time.


975
00:57:56.672 --> 00:57:57.923
Okay.

976
00:58:01.176 --> 00:58:05.263
<i>She's gonna be
somebody's only light</i>


977
00:58:05.347 --> 00:58:07.808
<i>Gonna shine tonight</i>

978
00:58:07.891 --> 00:58:09.351
Yeah

979
00:58:09.434 --> 00:58:15.190
<i>She's gonna be
somebody's baby tonight</i>


980
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.320
<i>I try to shut my eyes but I
can't get her out of my sight</i>


981
00:58:23.865 --> 00:58:28.787
<i>I know I'm gonna know it
but I gotta get over my fright</i>


982
00:58:31.915 --> 00:58:34.543
<i>Wait. I'm just gonna
walk up to her</i>


983
00:58:34.626 --> 00:58:36.712
<i>I'm gonna talk to her tonight</i>

984
00:58:36.795 --> 00:58:38.463
Mike! Mike!

985
00:58:43.051 --> 00:58:44.636
Are you okay?

986
00:58:46.221 --> 00:58:50.058
I think I came.
Didn't you feel it?


987
00:58:50.892 --> 00:58:52.894
Yeah. I guess I did.

988
00:58:55.772 --> 00:58:58.275
I gotta go, Stacy.

989
00:58:58.358 --> 00:59:00.277
I've really gotta go.

990
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.334
See ya.

991
00:59:16.418 --> 00:59:17.544
Bye.

992
00:59:19.296 --> 00:59:22.257
Linda, how long
does Doug take?


993
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.717
Doug takes
forever.


994
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.177
Come on.

995
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.305
He takes

996
00:59:29.097 --> 00:59:31.850
I thought you said he
took 30 to 40 minutes.


997
00:59:32.559 --> 00:59:35.979
That's right. I'm sorry.
I meant 30 to 40 minutes.


998
00:59:36.062 --> 00:59:38.148
Why? How long
did Damone take?


999
00:59:38.231 --> 00:59:42.486
Damone took

1000
00:59:43.695 --> 00:59:46.907
That's not bad
for a high school boy.


1001
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.121
<i>Raised on the radio</i>

1002
00:59:53.205 --> 00:59:55.791
<i>Yeah, I was raised
on the radio</i>


1003
00:59:55.874 --> 00:59:59.169
<i>Just like an all
-American boy</i>

1004
00:59:59.252 --> 01:00:01.838
Mike! Hi!
Hi.


1005
01:00:02.047 --> 01:00:04.591
God, I haven't seen you for a while.
Yeah.


1006
01:00:04.674 --> 01:00:07.302
Kind of in a hurry.
Got stuff I gotta do.


1007
01:00:07.385 --> 01:00:08.762
I'm in a hurry, too.

1008
01:00:08.845 --> 01:00:10.555
I just thought
I'd say hi to you.


1009
01:00:10.639 --> 01:00:11.890
Hi.

1010
01:00:15.644 --> 01:00:18.063
Hamilton, I'll take over
the fryer for a while.


1011
01:00:18.146 --> 01:00:20.690
Those boys at IBM ordered a stack
of those Catoh-of-the-Day boxes.


1012
01:00:20.774 --> 01:00:23.860
I told them you would personally
deliver them within the hour.


1013
01:00:23.944 --> 01:00:25.278
Aye, aye, sir.

1014
01:00:34.621 --> 01:00:37.457
Hamilton, come over here.

1015
01:00:39.876 --> 01:00:41.670
What are you doing?

1016
01:00:41.753 --> 01:00:42.879
I'm changing.

1017
01:00:42.963 --> 01:00:45.340
You took off your
Captain Hook uniform.


1018
01:00:45.423 --> 01:00:49.135
I thought I'd put my street
clothes on for the drive to IBM.


1019
01:00:49.219 --> 01:00:51.429
The uniform's
uncomfortable.


1020
01:00:51.555 --> 01:00:55.600
You're going there as a representative
of Captain Hook Fish and Chips.


1021
01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:58.019
Part of our image, part of
our appeal is that uniform.


1022
01:00:58.103 --> 01:00:59.354
You know that.

1023
01:00:59.437 --> 01:01:01.523
You want me to
put the stuff back on?


1024
01:01:01.606 --> 01:01:04.234
Yes, I do.
Show a little pride.


1025
01:01:04.943 --> 01:01:06.611
Aye, aye, sir.

1026
01:01:13.201 --> 01:01:17.205
<i>Talk on the phone

Don't let nobody</i>


1035

<i>Tell you that there's
nothing to do</i>


1036
01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:22.020
Dina, can you honestly
tell me that you forgot?


1037
01:02:22.395 --> 01:02:26.399
Forgot the magnetism of Robin Zander
or the charisma of Rick Nielsen?


1038
01:02:26.483 --> 01:02:28.985
That's kid stuff.
Kid stuff?


1039
01:02:29.486 --> 01:02:33.990
How about the tunes?
I want you to want me.


1040
01:02:34.074 --> 01:02:37.160

Mike? Mike?

1044
01:02:44.668 --> 01:02:47.212
Can I talk to you
for a sec?


1045
01:02:47.295 --> 01:02:51.925
Stacy, I'm doing business.
Call me tonight, all right?


1046
01:02:52.342 --> 01:02:56.054
No. I've gotta talk
to you now. Okay?


1047
01:02:58.974 --> 01:03:00.475
Don't go away.

1048
01:03:01.101 --> 01:03:02.602
Look at them.

1049
01:03:05.063 --> 01:03:08.608
I hope this is important because
I could be blowing a big deal.


1050
01:03:08.692 --> 01:03:10.402
Mike, I just...

1051
01:03:11.903 --> 01:03:14.739
I just want you to know
that I'm pregnant.


1052
01:03:17.617 --> 01:03:20.078
How do you know it's mine?
We only did it once.


1053
01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:22.998
I haven't been with anybody else.
I know it's yours.


1054
01:03:23.081 --> 01:03:25.375
Jesus! It was your idea.

1055
01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:28.461
You wanted to do it. You
wanted it more than I did!


1056
01:03:28.545 --> 01:03:30.839
No. Take that back.

1057
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:35.844
All right. I take it back.

1058
01:03:38.805 --> 01:03:41.683
Look, we gotta do something about it.
I mean...


1059
01:03:42.434 --> 01:03:44.185
We gotta get an abortion.

1060
01:03:44.436 --> 01:03:46.855
My brother Art
got his girlfriend one once.


1061
01:03:46.938 --> 01:03:48.940
It's simple.
It's no big deal.


1062
01:03:49.232 --> 01:03:52.485
Yeah. I got that planned.

1063
01:03:52.569 --> 01:03:56.656
It's going to cost
$150 at the Free Clinic.


1064
01:03:56.906 --> 01:03:59.534
Doesn't sound free to me.

1065
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.662
I suppose you want me
to pay for it.


1066
01:04:02.746 --> 01:04:06.416
Half, okay?
And a ride to the clinic.


1067
01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:08.877
$75 and a ride.

1068
01:04:11.004 --> 01:04:12.589
Okay.

1069
01:04:12.797 --> 01:04:14.632
Okay. Thanks.

1070
01:04:18.178 --> 01:04:19.679
Thank you.

1071
01:04:20.764 --> 01:04:22.682
God.

1072
01:04:25.143 --> 01:04:28.313
Rick, I need
that $50 you owe me.


1073
01:04:28.396 --> 01:04:29.647
<i>Don't have it.</i>

1074
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:32.067
I know times are tight,
but I really need it.


1075

<i>Don't have it now.</i>

1076
01:04:33.651 --> 01:04:36.571
When you needed the tickets,
I got them for you.


1077

it from you Thursday, okay?


1084
01:04:55.965 --> 01:04:58.259

1090
01:05:21.616 --> 01:05:25.120
<i>Real love affairs</i>

1091
01:05:25.203 --> 01:05:29.207
<i>Are heavy spells for a woman</i>

1092
01:05:29.499 --> 01:05:32.001
<i>And a man</i>

1093
01:05:33.044 --> 01:05:34.754
Is Mike there?
This is Stacy.


1094
01:05:34.838 --> 01:05:36.714
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

1095
01:05:37.674 --> 01:05:41.052
<i>Stacy, he says he's helping
his father in the garage.</i>


1096
01:05:41.136 --> 01:05:43.221
<i>He'll call you later.</i>

1097
01:05:45.723 --> 01:05:47.058
Brad!

1098
01:05:47.142 --> 01:05:49.519
Wait a second.

1099
01:05:53.523 --> 01:05:55.358
Yeah, this is it.
We're just going bowling.


1100
01:05:55.441 --> 01:05:57.360
Okay.
Thanks a lot.


1101
01:05:57.443 --> 01:05:59.445
See you later.
Okay.


1102
01:06:14.252 --> 01:06:16.296
How we doing in here?
Debbie, you ready to leave?


1103
01:06:16.379 --> 01:06:18.590
Yes. Thank you.

1104
01:06:18.882 --> 01:06:22.260
Stacy, I can't let you go
unless you have a ride home.


1105
01:06:22.468 --> 01:06:26.097
Oh. I told my boyfriend
to meet me downstairs.


1106
01:06:26.472 --> 01:06:28.057
Okay.

1107
01:06:28.183 --> 01:06:30.185
Thanks.

1108
01:06:38.693 --> 01:06:40.236
Brad.

1109
01:06:44.991 --> 01:06:47.285
Since when do you
go bowling anyway?


1110
01:06:47.619 --> 01:06:50.163
Okay, Brad. Please don't
tell Mom and Dad.


1111
01:06:50.246 --> 01:06:53.499
Come On! Who did it?

1112
01:06:57.962 --> 01:07:00.381
No. You're not gonna
tell me, are you?


1113
01:07:04.135 --> 01:07:07.931
Okay. It'll just
be your secret.


1114
01:07:08.514 --> 01:07:09.766
Okay.

1115
01:07:09.849 --> 01:07:11.434
You all right?

1116
01:07:11.517 --> 01:07:12.644
Yeah.

1117
01:07:13.144 --> 01:07:14.646
Come on.

1118
01:07:17.232 --> 01:07:18.358
You hungry?

1119
01:07:18.441 --> 01:07:19.525
Yeah.

1120
01:07:24.155 --> 01:07:27.408
I told you to tell Mike to pay for it.
Why didn't you tell him?


1121
01:07:27.492 --> 01:07:29.827
Linda, he didn't show up.

1122
01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:31.663
That little prick!

1123
01:07:32.163 --> 01:07:33.957
I called his house.

1124
01:07:34.499 --> 01:07:39.087
His mother told me he was in
the garage helping his father.


1125
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:41.965
Mike Damone's a no-brain
little prick, Stacy.


1126
01:07:42.048 --> 01:07:44.259
I'm not gonna let him
get away with this.


1127
01:07:44.342 --> 01:07:47.553
Linda,
please don't do anything.


1128
01:07:47.804 --> 01:07:49.597
I don't even
like the guy.


1129
01:07:49.681 --> 01:07:53.059
Stacy, he's not a guy.
He's a little prick!


1130
01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.196
<i>I can't explain the way I feel</i>

1131
01:08:06.531 --> 01:08:10.702
<i>Each time
I get behind the wheel</i>


1132
01:08:11.869 --> 01:08:16.749
<i>A rush of blood comes
after power surges</i>


1133
01:08:17.208 --> 01:08:22.005
<i>And my right foot urge
is about to burst</i>


1134
01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:25.341
Hi, Mikey!

1135
01:08:38.021 --> 01:08:39.856
Hi, Damone.

1136
01:08:51.743 --> 01:08:54.537
Damone, what went on
between you and Stacy?


1137
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:58.708
Let me tell you something.
Sometimes girls go haywire.


1138
01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:00.251
It happened a month ago.

1139
01:09:00.335 --> 01:09:03.171
I've been trying to think
of a way to tell you since.


1140
01:09:03.254 --> 01:09:07.717
We were out messing around,
and something happened.


1141
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.928
It's over.
It's no big deal.


1142
01:09:11.387 --> 01:09:13.639
Inevereven
called her again.


1143
01:09:16.225 --> 01:09:19.187
If you ask me, she's
a very aggressive girl.


1144
01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:20.355
Do you understand?

1145
01:09:20.438 --> 01:09:21.981
No, I don't understand.

1146
01:09:22.065 --> 01:09:24.025
She never really was
your girlfriend, Rat.


1147
01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:25.818
Fuck you, Damone!

1148
01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:28.863
There are a lot
of girls out there,


1149
01:09:28.946 --> 01:09:30.406
and you have to mess around
with Stacy?


1150
01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:33.034
What do you
gotta prove, anyway?


1151
01:09:35.161 --> 01:09:36.496
I'm sorry.

1152
01:09:36.579 --> 01:09:38.539
I always stick up
for you.


1153
01:09:38.623 --> 01:09:41.751
Whenever people say, "That
Damone, he's a loudmouth,"


1154
01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:43.086
and they say that a lot,

1155
01:09:43.169 --> 01:09:45.713
I always say, "Hey, you
just don't know Damone."


1156
01:09:45.797 --> 01:09:47.465
When they call you
an idiot,


1157
01:09:47.548 --> 01:09:50.385
I say, "Damone's not an idiot.
You just don't know him."


1158
01:09:50.468 --> 01:09:53.346
You know, maybe they do
know you pretty good.


1159
01:09:54.555 --> 01:09:56.682
Maybe I'm just
finding out now.


1160
01:09:56.766 --> 01:09:58.684
Get lost.

1161
01:10:02.271 --> 01:10:04.399
You want to do something
about it, Rat?


1162
01:10:04.482 --> 01:10:06.776
You want to do something about it?
Come on.


1163
01:10:06.859 --> 01:10:09.112
Come on, you wuss!
Okay. Let's go, man.


1164
01:10:09.195 --> 01:10:10.822
I'll break your
fucking head off.


1165
01:10:10.905 --> 01:10:11.948
Do something, man!

1166
01:10:12.031 --> 01:10:13.074
A big talker, man!

1167
01:10:13.157 --> 01:10:15.410
Knock this crap off!

1168
01:10:15.493 --> 01:10:17.829
Take it somewhere else.

1169
01:10:17.912 --> 01:10:19.914
Not in my gym, buddy-

1170
01:10:26.712 --> 01:10:28.673
Shit.

1171
01:10:31.592 --> 01:10:36.055
VVoke up in a great mood. I don't
know what the hell happened.


1172
01:10:38.599 --> 01:10:41.144
Come on. Hurry up.
Hurry up.


1173
01:10:41.227 --> 01:10:46.399
Today we're going to explore how
this hospital preserves human life.


1174
01:10:46.482 --> 01:10:51.112
We'll be visiting every floor, every level
where these fine doctors and nurses


1175
01:10:51.195 --> 01:10:54.866
take care of us
in life and in death.


1176
01:11:02.582 --> 01:11:05.877
Over 30 children are
delivered here each day.


1177
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.212
<i>Dr. Kramer
to the nurses' station.</i>


1178
01:11:08.296 --> 01:11:09.672
Good morning,
Doctor.


1179
01:11:09.755 --> 01:11:11.048
Hi.

1180
01:11:11.215 --> 01:11:13.134
Class,
this is Dr. Miller.


1181
01:11:13.217 --> 01:11:15.928
He'll be joining us for the
last part of our tour today.


1182
01:11:16.012 --> 01:11:18.139
Hi. If you guys
will follow me, please.


1183
01:11:21.726 --> 01:11:24.020
I'd like to ask you
one last time.


1184
01:11:24.103 --> 01:11:27.857
Conduct yourselves
with the utmost maturity.


1185
01:11:32.528 --> 01:11:34.322
You in my class?

1186
01:11:34.405 --> 01:11:35.615
I am today.

1187
01:11:44.707 --> 01:11:45.750
Yes, Greg?

1188
01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.210
Who are these guys?

1189
01:11:47.293 --> 01:11:49.003
Most of them
are derelicts.


1190
01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:52.006
They sold their bodies
to medicine for money.


1191
01:11:52.089 --> 01:11:55.510
About $30, I think?
Twenty-five.


1192
01:11:56.052 --> 01:11:57.553
Righteous bucks!

1193
01:11:57.637 --> 01:12:00.681
This gentleman
is named Arthur.


1194
01:12:00.765 --> 01:12:04.227
Arthur was good enough
to die last week of heart failure.


1195
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:07.688
We are fortunate enoughtoday
to view his body


1196
01:12:07.772 --> 01:12:10.274
in its pristine state.

1197
01:12:14.445 --> 01:12:17.031
Here an incision
has been made.


1198
01:12:17.114 --> 01:12:19.534
The ribs have been
sawed off,


1199
01:12:19.617 --> 01:12:23.871
allowing us to remove
the breastplate


1200
01:12:23.955 --> 01:12:28.709
and really observe the human organs
as they exist in their natural state.


1201
01:12:28.793 --> 01:12:31.379
Here we have
the human lungs.


1202
01:12:31.462 --> 01:12:34.507
And here is the human
heart which, you can see,


1203
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:37.969
is actually located
in the center of your chest.


1204
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:41.639
Oh! Gnarly!

1205
01:12:52.567 --> 01:12:54.068
Are you okay?

1206
01:12:54.151 --> 01:12:56.070
Yeah. I'm fine.

1207
01:12:56.153 --> 01:12:58.406
I just made a jerk
out of myself.


1208
01:12:58.489 --> 01:13:00.157
No, you didn't.

1209
01:13:00.449 --> 01:13:02.285
Can't go back in there.

1210
01:13:02.368 --> 01:13:06.205
Sure. VVe'll wait until they come
out, and then we'll blend in.


1211
01:13:07.164 --> 01:13:09.333
Here they come.

1212
01:13:09.834 --> 01:13:11.460
You're so nice.

1213
01:13:38.946 --> 01:13:42.491
<i>I don't know I don't know
which way I should go</i>


1214
01:13:42.575 --> 01:13:44.535
<i>I don't know</i>

1215
01:13:45.953 --> 01:13:47.997
<i>I don't know</i>

1216
01:13:52.918 --> 01:13:56.297
<i>I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>


1217
01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.382
<i>I don't know</i>

1218
01:14:00.009 --> 01:14:03.304
<i>I don't know, I don't know
if I'm high or I'm low</i>


1219
01:14:03.387 --> 01:14:05.389
<i>I don't know</i>

1220
01:14:06.891 --> 01:14:08.851
<i>I don't know</i>

1221
01:14:26.869 --> 01:14:28.871
<i>I don't know</i>

1222
01:14:35.628 --> 01:14:39.173
You should be coming on pretty soon, dude.
How muoh did you smoke?


1223
01:14:39.256 --> 01:14:42.635
This'll be a little
demonstration of that.


1224
01:14:42.718 --> 01:14:44.637
Listen up.

1225
01:14:46.806 --> 01:14:49.100
<i>What was that?
That was my skull.</i>


1226
01:14:49.767 --> 01:14:51.852
I'm so wasted!

1227
01:14:53.145 --> 01:14:56.273
Oh, man!
What is this stuff?


1228
01:14:57.858 --> 01:14:59.944
Doesn't that stuff
cause brain damage?


1229
01:15:00.027 --> 01:15:01.862
Only if you take it
every day for a month.


1230
01:15:01.946 --> 01:15:03.155
Bitching!

1231
01:15:04.115 --> 01:15:07.118
Dude, I'll pick you up in the
van and go to the dance.


1232
01:15:07.201 --> 01:15:08.744
Later.

1233
01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.247
Jeff, you have company.

1234
01:15:11.622 --> 01:15:15.292
Get out of here, Curtis. I don't
hear you unless you knock.


1235
01:15:21.465 --> 01:15:23.592
<i>That's better. Entrez.</i>

1236
01:15:24.885 --> 01:15:26.387
Mr. Hand!

1237
01:15:27.388 --> 01:15:30.725
Well, were you going
somewhere tonight, Jeff?


1238
01:15:30.808 --> 01:15:32.810
Yeah.
The graduation dance.


1239
01:15:32.893 --> 01:15:35.062
It's the last school
fiesta of the year.


1240
01:15:35.146 --> 01:15:37.982
I'm afraid we've got some
business to discuss here.


1241
01:15:38.065 --> 01:15:40.234
Did I do something
wrong, Mr. Hand?


1242
01:15:40.317 --> 01:15:44.822
According to my
calculations, Mr. Spicoli,


1243
01:15:45.573 --> 01:15:47.867
you wasted a total of

1244
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:50.578
eight hours of my time
this year.


1245
01:15:50.661 --> 01:15:54.999
And rest assured,
that is a kind estimate.


1246
01:15:55.082 --> 01:15:59.336
Now I have the unique pleasure
of squaring our account.


1247
01:15:59.837 --> 01:16:03.132
Tonight you and I are going
to talk in great detail


1248
01:16:03.215 --> 01:16:04.633
about the Davis Agreement,

1249
01:16:04.717 --> 01:16:08.721
all the associated treaties, and the
American Revolution in particular.


1250
01:16:09.054 --> 01:16:13.893
If you can turn to page 47 of
Land of <i>Truth</i> and Liberty.


1251
01:16:14.226 --> 01:16:17.730
Oh, I left that book
in my locker, Mr. Hand.


1252
01:16:17.813 --> 01:16:21.609
In that case, I'm glad I
remembered to bring an extra copy


1253
01:16:21.692 --> 01:16:22.943
just for you.

1254
01:16:47.218 --> 01:16:52.097
<i>He was a hardheaded
man He was brutally handsome</i>


1255
01:16:52.181 --> 01:16:55.935
<i>And she was
terminally pretty</i>


1256
01:16:56.018 --> 01:16:59.647
<i>She held him up and he
held her for ransom</i>


1257
01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:04.109
<i>In the heart
of the cold, cold city</i>


1258
01:17:06.237 --> 01:17:07.613
Look, Mark.

1259
01:17:07.696 --> 01:17:11.075
I want to apologize for
everything that's happened.


1260
01:17:11.158 --> 01:17:13.452
I'm really sorry.

1261
01:17:13.536 --> 01:17:15.579
A guy just doesn't
do that to a buddy.


1262
01:17:15.663 --> 01:17:17.665
I understand.
You can't help it.


1263
01:17:17.748 --> 01:17:20.042
You're just lewd,
crude and obnoxious.


1264
01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:21.669
I can deal with that.

1265
01:17:21.752 --> 01:17:23.003
Excuse me.

1266
01:17:27.925 --> 01:17:30.553
Listen,
are we still friends?


1267
01:17:32.012 --> 01:17:33.889
Huh?
Okay_


1268
01:17:34.473 --> 01:17:36.392
All right.

1269
01:17:36.475 --> 01:17:39.937
What Jefferson
was saying was, "Hey!


1270
01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:43.190
"We left this England place
'cause it was bogus.


1271
01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.319
"So if we don't get some oool
rules ourselves, pronto,


1272
01:17:47.403 --> 01:17:50.072
"we'll just be bogus, too."

1273
01:17:51.782 --> 01:17:53.367
Very close, Jeff.

1274
01:17:56.287 --> 01:17:58.247
I think I've made my point
with you tonight.


1275
01:17:58.330 --> 01:17:59.456
Mr. Hand,

1276
01:17:59.874 --> 01:18:03.168
do you have a guy like me
in class every year?


1277
01:18:03.252 --> 01:18:06.380
You know, a guy who you
make an example of?


1278
01:18:07.256 --> 01:18:08.382
You'll find out
next year.


1279
01:18:08.465 --> 01:18:09.800
No way!

1280
01:18:09.884 --> 01:18:11.093
As soon as
I cruise history,


1281
01:18:11.176 --> 01:18:13.596
I'm not coming near your
side of the building.


1282
01:18:13.679 --> 01:18:15.014
Cruise history?

1283
01:18:15.097 --> 01:18:16.682
Soon as I pass
your class.


1284
01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.227
If you pass.

1285
01:18:20.311 --> 01:18:22.396
You're gonna flunk me?

1286
01:18:22.479 --> 01:18:26.025
Don't worry, Spicoli.
You'll probably squeak by.


1287
01:18:26.108 --> 01:18:29.486
Yeah!
<i>Aloha,</i> Mr. Hand.


1288
01:18:32.448 --> 01:18:33.824
<i>Aloha,</i> Spicoli.

1289
01:18:41.999 --> 01:18:44.919
Honey, these are
my two star students.


1290
01:18:45.002 --> 01:18:48.172
Boys, I'd like you to meet
my wife, Mrs. Vargas.


1291
01:18:48.714 --> 01:18:49.924
Hi.

1292
01:19:02.102 --> 01:19:03.979
Summer! Yeah!

1293
01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:05.689
Totally!

1294
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.320
I wrote him a letter.

1295
01:19:11.403 --> 01:19:14.073
Tell me what you think.
"Dear Doug.


1296
01:19:14.156 --> 01:19:17.284
"L received your message that you
weren't coming to my graduation.


1297
01:19:17.368 --> 01:19:21.163
"Doug, this is not the kind of
thing that occurs between adults.


1298
01:19:21.246 --> 01:19:24.708
"Maybe you've found someone
new, someone more mature.


1299
01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:29.421
"But if you ask me, Doug,
you're the one being childish.


1300
01:19:30.214 --> 01:19:33.968
"Anyhow, if you think I'm gonna sit
around and wait for you, forget it.


1301
01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:37.137
"Sincerely, Linda." What
do you think? Uh...


1302
01:19:37.221 --> 01:19:39.431
I have another version
where I call him an asshole.


1303
01:19:39.515 --> 01:19:41.850
No, that one's better.
It's more...


1304
01:19:41.934 --> 01:19:43.852
Mature?
Yeah.


1305
01:19:43.936 --> 01:19:45.854
I don't have to sink to his level.
Yeah.


1306
01:19:45.938 --> 01:19:47.648
I can go out with anyone
I want, practically.


1307
01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:49.233
That's right.

1308
01:19:49.733 --> 01:19:53.153
Yeah. Thanks
for cheering me up.


1309

Hey,dude!
I know that song.

Hey, I'm not.
I'm not!

Linda,
I finally figured it out.


1323
01:21:06.185 --> 01:21:09.063
I don't want sex.
Anyone can have sex.

What do you want?

You want romance?

1328
01:21:17.738 --> 01:21:21.784
In Ridgemont? VVe can't even get
cable TV here, and you want romance.


1329
01:21:24.244 --> 01:21:28.665
Another summer at Perry's.
I can't. I swear.


1330

It's not that bad.

01:22:09.081 --> 01:22:11.250
How you doing?
Fine.


1348
01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:13.877
I'm glad you came over

1349
01:22:13.961 --> 01:22:17.089
'cause I have this picture of
me that I wanted to give to you


1350
01:22:17.172 --> 01:22:19.716
so that you'll remember to
call me over the summer.


1351

I don't know. I'm going to be

I'll give you a call
sometime.

That'd be great.
Stacy!


1355
01:22:56.795 --> 01:22:59.131
You worked
at All American Burger.


1356
01:22:59.214 --> 01:23:00.507
Seven months ago.

1357
01:23:02.426 --> 01:23:05.554
I knew it.

1358
01:23:21.695 --> 01:23:23.906
Why don't you
get a job, Spicoli?


1359
01:23:23.989 --> 01:23:25.532
What for?

1360
01:23:25.616 --> 01:23:26.783
You need money.

1361
01:23:26.867 --> 01:23:30.454
All I need are
some tasty waves,


1362
01:23:30.537 --> 01:23:32.956
cool buzz and I'm fine.

1363
01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:37.461
Thanks.
Can I use your bathroom?


1364
01:23:38.754 --> 01:23:40.839
Yeah, go ahead.

1365
01:23:40.923 --> 01:23:42.424
It's the first door

taught me the procedure and I...

1377
01:24:19.836 --> 01:24:21.421
Come on, shit head!
Let's go!


1378
01:24:21.505 --> 01:24:23.632
Get off my case,
motherfucker.


1379
