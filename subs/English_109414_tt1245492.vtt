That's not true. It is true!

00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:21.987
You're supposed to
shit twice a day. No.


44

That's not true. That's
what they used to think.

Now they know you're supposed
to shit six times a day.

smoking weed. But...

that's 'cause of gluten.

Who the fuck told you not to eat gluten?
It's just true.

You don't even know
what gluten is.

No, you have no idea
what gluten is.

I do know what gluten is.

58
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:49.622
Gluten's a vague term.

59
00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:52.792
It's something that's used to categorize
things that are bad, you know?


60
00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.503
Calories, that's a gluten.
Fat, that's a gluten.

Somebodyjust told you you
probably shouldn't eat gluten,


62
00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.383
you're like, "Oh, I guess
I shouldn't eat gluten."


63
00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.635
Gluten means bad shit, man,
and I'm not eating it.

than the previous bite.

00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:17.663
Yeah? Yeah, man, right?

159
00:06:17.747 --> 00:06:19.874
Look at it. A bit much.

160
00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:21.417
I don't think it
is a bit much.


161
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.740
I think it's right
on the money.


162
00:06:22.793 --> 00:06:24.337
What is he, Pablo Escobar?

163
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.671
Come on, man, this is
an awesome street.


164
00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:27.423
Channing Tatum lives up there.

165
00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:29.300
Oh, for the love of... Will
you stop talking about...


166
00:06:29.383 --> 00:06:30.468
This is the sexiest
street in America.


167
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:31.677
You and Channing Tatum.

168
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:33.054
I think he's attractive.

169
00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:36.307
I think it's a cool house.
I know you do.


170
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.934
I can't wait to see inside it.

171
00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:39.602
That's why I'm excited.

172
00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:43.397
Ha-ha! Yes! What's up, man?
Seth!


173
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:45.399
So happy you're here. I'm
so happy to be here.


174
00:06:45.483 --> 00:06:46.734
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

175
00:06:46.817 --> 00:06:48.236
It's Jay. It's Jay.

176
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.696
LWlnever forget it again, man.
Good to see you.


177
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.490
Nice to see you. Come on in.
Yeah! Yeah, great.


178
00:06:52.573 --> 00:06:54.784
James: Check it out.
My new place!


179
00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:56.619
Seth: Awesome, man!

180
00:06:56.702 --> 00:06:57.828
Designed it myself.

181
00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:00.665
Really cool. This place
is beautiful, man.


182
00:07:00.748 --> 00:07:02.750
This place is like
a piece of me.


183
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:04.919
You two just
stepped inside me.


184
00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:08.089
You let us both cum inside you.
Yeah.


185
00:07:08.172 --> 00:07:10.883
Icing on the cake.
Check it out.


186
00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:12.677
Painted them myself.

187
00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:14.095
Huh.

188
00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:16.097
Side by side. A team.

189
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.181
(LAUGHS) Holy shit.

190
00:07:17.682 --> 00:07:19.392
So, is it weird?

191
00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:21.435
No. You sure?

192
00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:23.187
I really like it.

193
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:24.397
What do you think, Jay?

194
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.607
I'm not a big art guy.

195
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:27.942
You don't like art?

196
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:29.902
Well, come on...

197
00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:31.904
You play video games? Yes.

198
00:07:31.988 --> 00:07:34.031
Well, guess what, buddy?
You like art.


199
00:07:34.115 --> 00:07:35.116
Yep.

200
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.325
You ever been to Subway?

201
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:37.451
Yes.

202
00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:38.911
You order a sandwich?

203
00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:41.122
Somebody put that together for you, dude.
That's art.


204
00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:42.290
Sandwich artist.

205
00:07:42.373 --> 00:07:43.613
So, let me lay
this on you, Jay.


206
00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:44.667
Oh, fuck.

207
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.042
Your mama's pussy
was the canvas.


208
00:07:46.043 --> 00:07:47.795
Your Dad's dick was
the paintbrush.


209
00:07:47.878 --> 00:07:49.880
Boom. You're the art. Huh?

210
00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:52.383
Thanks, James Franco.
You got it.


211
00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:53.968
Seth! Mindy, hello.

212
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:55.636
Oh, my God, great to see you.
Oh, you, too.


213
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.971
Long time. How's it going?

214
00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:59.307
You know Jay? I don't think
I've ever actually met you.


215
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.058
<i>You were so good in
Million Dollar Baby.</i>


216
00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:03.144
That's amazing. Thank you
so much for saying that.


217
00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:05.147
Oh, my God, if I don't
fuck Michael Cera tonight,


218
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:07.231
I'm gonna blow my brains out.
What?


219
00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:09.525
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

220
00:08:09.608 --> 00:08:13.070
hairless, probably has a huge
cock, coked out of his mind...


221
00:08:13.154 --> 00:08:15.406
You can do a lot better.
That's just trouble.


222
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:19.035
So, Ri-Ri, how about you, you
ever see a psychiatrist?


223
00:08:19.118 --> 00:08:20.328
Um...

224
00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:23.664
(GRUNTS)

225
00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:25.416
Jason: That's not cool.
Don't touch my butt, bitch.


226
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:27.585
Michael, that's not cool. Would
you shut the fuck up, Jason!


227
00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:29.545
We're playing a game, man.

228
00:08:30.004 --> 00:08:31.797
Say cheese, baby.

229
00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:34.592
What's up, buddy?
How's it going, dude?


230
00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:35.885
Good to see you, man.

231
00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:37.511
Is that Jay Baruchel?
Hi, there. Hey.


232
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:38.762
Oh, my God, get in here, dude.

233
00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:40.430
How's it going, Jonah?
What are you doing?


234
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:42.683
Good. How you doing, buddy?
Oh, my gosh.


235
00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:44.810
Welcome back. Thank
you very much.


236
00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:46.771
When'd you get in?
Uh, this morning,


237
00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:48.689
and boy, are my arms tired.

238
00:08:48.773 --> 00:08:50.191
(LAUGHS)

239
00:08:50.274 --> 00:08:51.484
Dude, that's great.

240
00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:52.568
Thank you. Jonah: Sick.

241
00:08:52.651 --> 00:08:54.153
What have you guys been doing?

242
00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:56.072
Oh, we just hung out all day.

243
00:08:56.155 --> 00:09:00.076
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers, and
smoked about a fucking pound of weed


244
00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:01.577
and played a bunch
of video games.


245
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.871
Weed is tight. Weed is tight.
That's awesome.


246
00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:05.194
That's awesome.
Weed is awesome.


247
00:09:05.247 --> 00:09:07.583
It was like the golfing
sequence in Navy <i>SEALs.</i>


248
00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:09.710
Sick reference, though, bro.
Oh, thanks, bud.


249
00:09:09.794 --> 00:09:11.962
Dude, your references are out of control.
Everyone knows that.


250
00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.631
Hey, thanks, man. I'm jealous.

251
00:09:13.714 --> 00:09:16.008
I would have been
there in a heartbeat,


252
00:09:16.092 --> 00:09:19.387
but, uh, I actually just adopted
this incontinent spaniel.


253
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.637
She's a really beautiful soul.

254
00:09:20.638 --> 00:09:22.264
Her name's Ahjhai. Ahjhai?

255
00:09:22.348 --> 00:09:23.391
Yeah. How do you spell it?

256
00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:25.017
A
-H
-J
-H
-A
-I.

257
00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:26.227
A
-H...

258
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.269
You want to see a
picture of her?


259
00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:29.397
Oh, she's so sweet. Hey!

260
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.731
Look at her. Seth: Aw!

261
00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:32.495
She can't bark. She
doesn't know how, so...


262
00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:33.651
She doesn't know
how to bark, even?


263
00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:34.735
She doesn't know how to bark,

264
00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:36.404
so I've tried to teach her

265
00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:38.656
and she just kind of
screams, and so she was up,


266
00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:41.409
had her face smushed against
the cage, and was, like...


267
00:09:41.492 --> 00:09:42.701
(YELLING) Ah!

268
00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:44.995
Yeah, cool. Um...

269
00:09:45.663 --> 00:09:47.957
Tell you what, boys,
I'm kind ofjonesing,


270
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.419
so I'm gonna find someone loan bum
a smoke off of outside, all right?


271
00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:53.254
That's tight, dude.
Honestly, I like you.


272
00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:54.338
Hey, likewise.

273
00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:55.840
Seth: Okay, dude, come back.

274
00:09:55.923 --> 00:09:58.759
I'll be right back. You're holding court.
All right, boys.


275
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:02.054
Dude. I know. I think we're
making some progress.


276
00:10:02.138 --> 00:10:03.097
That was really good.

277
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.556
And honestly, he's
your old friend.


278
00:10:04.557 --> 00:10:05.933
We're your new friends.
He feels threatened.


279
00:10:06.016 --> 00:10:07.017
Yeah, man.

280
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:08.769
You know, and I get it.

281
00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:09.812
It's gonna be fine.

282
00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:11.312
I honestly think
tonight's the night


283
00:10:11.313 --> 00:10:12.513
we bust this whole thing open.

284
00:10:12.565 --> 00:10:15.734
And I'm lucky. It's the
same thing a lot, though.


285
00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:17.445
It's, like, my TV
wife opensthefﬂdge,


286
00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:20.364
andis, Hke, "What happened
to the birthday cake?"


287
00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:23.117
And I come outwith, like,
a little frosting, like,


288
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.561
(GOOFY VOICE) "What
birthday cake?"


289
00:10:24.618 --> 00:10:26.203
'Cause you ate the cake! Yeah.

290
00:10:26.287 --> 00:10:27.496
'Cause you ate the cake!

291
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.789
"It's my birthday."

292
00:10:28.873 --> 00:10:30.541
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

293
00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:33.210
That's why y'all number one.
'Cause of that.


294
00:10:33.544 --> 00:10:34.587
You're Jay, right? Yeah.

295
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.671
Seth's boy? Yeah.

296
00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:37.047
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.


297
00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:38.256
Good. Likewise, likewise.

298
00:10:38.257 --> 00:10:40.259
I'm Craig, man. This is Emma.
Hi. Hi, there.


299
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:41.969
You just in town
visiting him, or what?


300
00:10:42.052 --> 00:10:45.181
Yeah. Just for a little
visit, you know.


301
00:10:45.264 --> 00:10:47.266
I try to not come
down here very much.


302
00:10:47.349 --> 00:10:48.642
I don't really love it here.

303
00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:49.685
You don't like LA?

304
00:10:49.768 --> 00:10:53.564
I'm just not really
into the LA lifestyle.


305
00:10:54.064 --> 00:10:55.357
What lifestyle are you into?

306
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:57.943
Look at him. He's, like,
a hipster, right?


307
00:10:58.027 --> 00:11:00.613
No, I'm not a hipster, at all.

308
00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:03.282
Yeah, yeah, you do seem
to hate a lot of things,


309
00:11:03.365 --> 00:11:05.034
and the bottom of your
pants are awful tight.


310
00:11:05.117 --> 00:11:08.954
No, I just... I don't like Los Angeles.
It doesn't make me a hipster.


311
00:11:09.038 --> 00:11:11.290
I'll bet you hate movies

00:23:16.723 --> 00:23:17.724
(PANTING) You all right?

623
00:23:17.807 --> 00:23:19.726
(SOBBING) I tried to save Aziz.
I tried.


624
00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:21.603
(SOBBING) You did your best, man.
I love you.


625
00:23:21.686 --> 00:23:23.980
Why the fuck did you
guys run out there?


626
00:23:24.064 --> 00:23:25.607
You know what, James, can
you lower your voice?


627
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.900
You're freaking out Jay!

628
00:23:26.983 --> 00:23:28.818
Maybe I'm a little
freaked out, too!


629
00:23:28.902 --> 00:23:30.445
He's not as strong as you.
Jay: They all fell in.


630
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.697
James: Look at my house! Jay: I tried
to save them. They all fell in.

(Jonah SHUSHING) Get your fucking hands off me.
Jonah, stop touching me.


632
00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:37.035
Can we get Jay some
water, please?


633
00:23:37.118 --> 00:23:38.369
Can we get him some hydration?

634
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.829
He needs to be hydrated. Seth:
The water's not working!


635
00:23:39.913 --> 00:23:41.414
Everyone just runs
out the door!


636
00:23:41.498 --> 00:23:42.749
My phone is dead.

637
00:23:42.832 --> 00:23:44.501
Guys, the fucking
lnternet's not working!


638
00:23:44.584 --> 00:23:46.461
Let's watch the TV.
Let's check the news.


639
00:23:46.544 --> 00:23:48.338
Jay: Where is the TV?

640
00:23:48.421 --> 00:23:50.423
It's in the floor.
In the floor?


641
00:23:50.507 --> 00:23:52.259
Craig: Oh, that's dope.
James: Yeah, cool, huh?


642
00:23:52.342 --> 00:23:53.343
That's really neat.

643
00:23:53.426 --> 00:23:54.844
That is impressive, James.

644

Shit. It's gone, guys.

654
00:24:16.283 --> 00:24:19.619
(STAMMERS) So I
think we should...


655
00:24:19.703 --> 00:24:22.789
I think we should probably
go back to your place, eh?


656
00:24:22.872 --> 00:24:24.291
What are you talking
about, man?


657
00:24:24.374 --> 00:24:27.544
No, no way. I'm
not leaving here.


658
00:24:27.627 --> 00:24:31.006
I don't want to die at
James Franco's house.


659
00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:32.966
Seth: You heard the TV.

660
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:36.720
The TV said stay here. It
said stay in your homes.


661
00:24:36.803 --> 00:24:39.889
We need to stay here until they
start rescuing people, okay?


662
00:24:39.973 --> 00:24:42.475
A huge earthquake happens.
Who do they rescue first?


663
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.977
Actors. Seth: Famous people.

664
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.521
They'll get Clooney,
Sandra Bullock, me.


665
00:24:46.604 --> 00:24:48.356
If there's room,
you guys'll come.


666
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.567
The point is, is that we're all
gonna get out of this first.

00:24:52.819 --> 00:24:54.154
Seth: It's already going
crazy out there, guys.


670
00:24:54.237 --> 00:24:57.490
We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay?
I'm a victim.


671
00:24:57.574 --> 00:25:00.410
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life.
People can smell it on me.

they tittie-fucked me.

uncomfortable.

Don't do that, Jonah!
Jay: Jesus.


760
00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:05.928
Oh, no. Jonah, give it back.

761
00:28:05.929 --> 00:28:07.596
I don't know! I don't know.
Don't do that.

some fun, man.

Okay, okay, Jesus.

Jonah: Look, just because a bunch
of people fell into a hole outside


769
00:28:19.817 --> 00:28:21.235
doesn't mean we can't
have some fun.


770
00:28:21.236 --> 00:28:23.863
We're a bunch of best friends hanging out.
It's like a sleepover.

Okay, food. How are we
gonna deal with this?

00:28:27.158 --> 00:28:28.201
Um...

773

she feels safe.

Yeah. And comfortable.

1238

not feel safe?

rapey going on right now.

gonna rape somebody?

I'm just trying to
lay it out there.

anyone, all right?

somebody, it's Jay.

up with the rape idea.

Okay.

1424
00:53:41.546 --> 00:53:42.797
Let me ask you something.

1425
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.801
You really think this is

1426
00:53:46.885 --> 00:53:48.344
the Apocalypse?

1427
00:53:48.428 --> 00:53:50.930
You saw something out
there, didn't you?


1428
00:53:51.014 --> 00:53:56.436
All right, let's just say for
sake of argument, what if I did?


1429
00:53:56.519 --> 00:53:58.646
What if this is the real
shit, right now, happening?


1430
00:53:59.647 --> 00:54:02.108
What if it is, man? We're
not prepared for this.


1431
00:54:02.233 --> 00:54:04.153
What do we do? What's next?
It says in the Bible,


1432
00:54:04.235 --> 00:54:06.154
"The worthy will
ascend to Heaven."


1433
00:54:06.237 --> 00:54:11.451
Even if it is the Apocalypse,
it's not the end of us.


1434
00:54:11.534 --> 00:54:13.078
There's still hope.

1435
00:54:13.161 --> 00:54:16.414
We just have to somehow try
to prove our worthiness.

00:54:16.498 --> 00:54:18.750
Craig: Okay, so,
you mean, like,


1437
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:22.295
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people


1438
00:54:22.378 --> 00:54:23.618
that'll do the
same shit to you.

those commandments.

get through this.

you talking about?

of this nice magazine


1452
00:55:01.543 --> 00:55:03.461
I was nice enough
to tell you about.


1453

long enough, I end
upjizzing, dude.

shit works for you?

don't you fucking aim, huh?

It just goes everywhere.

It's like a fucking
wild fireman's hose.

What, you never
had any brothers?


1467
00:55:30.321 --> 00:55:32.921
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking
sock or on a fucking tissue?


1468
00:55:32.991 --> 00:55:34.742
No, I don't have any brothers.

1469
00:55:34.826 --> 00:55:36.286
I was raised in a
house of women!


1470
00:55:36.369 --> 00:55:38.121
I highly doubt they
fucking taught you


1471
00:55:38.204 --> 00:55:40.832
to fucking close your eyes and
fucking cum wherever you want!

1480
00:55:58.558 --> 00:56:00.559

around this fucking house


1481
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.769

1482

1483

one more time,

shoot it off!

bullets, bitch.

1504

I'm just... I'm too
thirsty to do this.


1505
00:56:47.941 --> 00:56:49.150
And the fucking
bitter irony is


1506
00:56:49.234 --> 00:56:51.526
I'm not gonna have my thirst
quenched until I finish this.

1508

Don't walk away. Danny,
don't walk away from me!


1509
00:56:54.614 --> 00:56:57.659
It's too late, Seth. I've
already walked away too much.


1510
00:56:57.742 --> 00:56:59.494
No, you haven't. You
could still come back


1511
00:56:59.577 --> 00:57:02.121
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.


1512
00:57:04.123 --> 00:57:05.333
Danny?

1513
00:57:06.042 --> 00:57:07.252
Daniel?

1514
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:17.845
Need a hand?

1515
00:57:18.429 --> 00:57:19.722
Yeah, dude.

1516
00:57:19.806 --> 00:57:20.847
Your shift just ended, man.

1517
00:57:20.848 --> 00:57:22.225
You don't have to help
me if you don't want to.


1518
00:57:22.308 --> 00:57:23.476
It's fine, I get it.

1519
00:57:23.559 --> 00:57:25.311
The fuck else am I doing?

1520
00:57:25.395 --> 00:57:27.522
I appreciate it, man.
Thank you.


1521
00:57:27.605 --> 00:57:29.023
Done and done. That's cool.

1522
00:57:35.363 --> 00:57:37.907
I don't know why I'm thinking
of this, but remember that time


1523
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:41.786
that I got you a fucking
Taco Bell gift certificate


1524
00:57:41.869 --> 00:57:43.579
for, like, 20 bucks,
and I bet you


1525
00:57:43.663 --> 00:57:45.623
that you couldn't eat all
of that in one sitting.


1526
00:57:45.707 --> 00:57:47.500
I do remember that. I
remember thinking,


1527
00:57:47.583 --> 00:57:48.823
"How much food
could 20 dollars"


1528
00:57:48.876 --> 00:57:50.253
"possibly buy you
at Taco Bell?"


1529
00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:51.754
And the answer is infinite.

1530
00:57:51.838 --> 00:57:53.840
And we went to see
fucking Gladiator.


1531
00:57:53.923 --> 00:57:54.966
Yeah.

1532
00:57:55.049 --> 00:57:57.468
And you sharted midway
through the movie.


1533
00:57:57.552 --> 00:57:59.220
I did. Due to the
tigers' appearance.


1534
00:57:59.304 --> 00:58:00.847
I got scared of the tigers.
Yeah.


1535
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:02.390
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...


1536
00:58:02.473 --> 00:58:03.932
(MIMICS FART NOISE).
And then I shat.


1537
00:58:03.933 --> 00:58:05.226
I shat in the theater.

1538
00:58:05.393 --> 00:58:06.561
(LAUGHS)

1539
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:08.396
(BOTH SCREAMING)

1540
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.690
(BOTH GROANING)

1541
00:58:12.233 --> 00:58:14.235
Jesus. Oh, fuck.

1542
00:58:14.319 --> 00:58:15.737
You guys Okay?

1543
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.447
I broke my ass in half. Here.

1544
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.032
Shit, they got through!

1545
00:58:19.115 --> 00:58:21.326
You guys fucking did it.
Oh, my God.


1546
00:58:21.409 --> 00:58:22.410
Fuck. Did that hurt?

1547
00:58:22.493 --> 00:58:23.745
Seth: Oh, yes,
it fucking hurt.


1548
00:58:23.828 --> 00:58:25.830
Iloosened this up for
you, I'll have you know.


1549
00:58:25.913 --> 00:58:27.707
Okay, just shut up. It's
fucking dark down here.


1550
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:30.251
Hold on, hold on.

1551
00:58:31.127 --> 00:58:32.211
Nice.

1552
00:58:32.337 --> 00:58:34.255
Okay, good. Thank you.
What is that?


1553
00:58:34.339 --> 00:58:37.008
That's Terrence Peterson. My
monkey flashlight keychain.


1554
00:58:37.133 --> 00:58:38.801
Monkey flashlight keychain?
Mmm-hmm.


1555
00:58:38.885 --> 00:58:40.428
What's his name?
Terrence Peterson.


1556
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:41.929
You see it, Seth? No. Where...

1557
00:58:42.013 --> 00:58:43.306
Are you sure it's
even down here?


1558
00:58:43.389 --> 00:58:44.432
Terry Pete.

1559
00:58:44.515 --> 00:58:45.850
Uh, not sure.

1560
00:58:45.933 --> 00:58:47.226
Jay: Is there, is there
any weird shit down here?


1561
00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:50.188
Nah, it's where I keep all
my stuff from my old movies.


1562
00:58:50.271 --> 00:58:51.522

1564
00:59:02.867 --> 00:59:04.452
What? Is someone down there?

1565
00:59:04.535 --> 00:59:07.705
It's your fucking stupid
cutout from Spider-Man 3.


1566
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:09.332
Jesus Christ.

1567
00:59:09.415 --> 00:59:10.458
No shit!

1568
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:11.626
Jay: There it is! Seth: Yes!
Yeah!


1569
00:59:11.709 --> 00:59:13.628
What, did you find it?
Seth: Yeah!

Fuck, man.

1593
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.919
I'm just pouring myself
another glass of water


1594
00:59:55.002 --> 00:59:56.963
to wash down that dry-ass
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.


1595
00:59:57.046 --> 00:59:58.297
That's very nice,
but you can't just


1596
00:59:58.381 --> 01:00:00.021
pour yourself another
glass of water, man!


1597
01:00:00.091 --> 01:00:01.175
Will you cut it out?

1598
01:00:01.259 --> 01:00:03.511
Yeah. We agreed to
one glass at dinner,


1599
01:00:03.594 --> 01:00:04.762
we voted on it, man.

1600
01:00:04.846 --> 01:00:06.097
Well, man, I'm just
getting sick and tired


1601
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.515
of all these fucking
rules, man.


1602
01:00:07.598 --> 01:00:09.016
You don't see me putting
rules on you guys.


1603

You cannot have another
glass of water.

Jay weighs 150
pounds less than me.


1605
01:00:13.646 --> 01:00:15.523
Why the fuck is it fair

1606
01:00:15.606 --> 01:00:17.483
that him and I should drink
the same amount of water?


1607
01:00:17.567 --> 01:00:19.277
We should be
dividing our rations


1608
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.237
based on our
proportionate size.


1609

I don't want to come off as
a diva here or anything.


1610
01:00:23.865 --> 01:00:25.116
It's just that I
think everyone


1611
01:00:25.199 --> 01:00:26.492
should split
everything equally.

should have the fucking same.

you'd be more hydrated.

the fucking punch line.

Just sit the fuck down!

Okay, I'm done.

any more water.

You guys forced my fucking
hand by ganging up on me.

All right, guys,


1633
01:01:19.086 --> 01:01:20.213
let's get rid of him.

1634
01:01:20.296 --> 01:01:21.589
Seth: What? What do you mean?

1635
01:01:21.672 --> 01:01:23.216
Like, kick him out
of the house?


1636
01:01:23.299 --> 01:01:26.052
His fucking reckless behavior
is dragging us all down.


1637
01:01:26.135 --> 01:01:28.137
I mean, he wasted
our water twice.


1638
01:01:28.221 --> 01:01:30.097
Two times. Two times.

1639
01:01:30.181 --> 01:01:32.683
Dan is under a lot of pressure.
Okay?


1640
01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:34.519
And he's not handling it as
good as the rest of us are.


1641
01:01:34.602 --> 01:01:37.313
Look at him. He's wearing
my fucking tuxedo.


1642
01:01:37.396 --> 01:01:38.981
He's been eating nonstop.

1643
01:01:39.065 --> 01:01:41.442
The fucker's gained
weight since he got here.


1644
01:01:41.526 --> 01:01:43.528
The fucker's got to go.

1645
01:01:43.611 --> 01:01:44.612
Go.

1646
01:01:44.695 --> 01:01:46.280
The fucker's got to go.

1647

You guys are gonna vote
me off the island?

guys breakfast.

Shit, man, you wasted half of
our food when you did that.


1652
01:02:02.129 --> 01:02:04.840
Just thought I was doing
something nice for you guys.


1653
01:02:04.924 --> 01:02:08.219
Just to apologize for my
behavior at the party.

Party I wasn't
even invited to.

(SIGHS) Danny: I'm
not an idiot.


1656
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:15.017
I know why you guys don't fucking
call me or hang out with me anymore.


1657
01:02:15.101 --> 01:02:18.145
It's because I party
so fucking hard.


1658
01:02:18.604 --> 01:02:21.649
Always have. Ever
since I was a baby.


1659
01:02:21.732 --> 01:02:23.442
I wouldn't just suck
on my mama's titties.


1660
01:02:23.526 --> 01:02:26.654
I would fucking bang
'em and motorboat 'em.


1661
01:02:27.822 --> 01:02:31.367
Everything I've been doing has
just been a cry for help.


1662
01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:34.245
When I came on your
magazine, James,


1663
01:02:34.328 --> 01:02:36.289
it was a cum for help.

1664
01:02:36.372 --> 01:02:40.167
I've just been crying and c:
Omin' and crying and c: Omin',


1665
01:02:40.835 --> 01:02:43.087
tears from the tip
of my penis, dudes.


1666
01:02:44.422 --> 01:02:46.132
I'm sorry, all right? You
can cum wherever you want.


1667
01:02:46.215 --> 01:02:48.634
I don't even care about
cumming anymore.


1668
01:02:50.177 --> 01:02:52.597
Right now, I'm just
kind of into going.


1669
01:02:53.764 --> 01:02:55.433
Danny. Danny.

1670
01:02:55.516 --> 01:02:56.601
Hey. Come on, man.

1671
01:02:56.684 --> 01:02:58.185
I fucked up.

1672
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:59.520
I'm sorry, man. 
Come on, look,

1673
01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:01.314
I was wrong. Seth: I
feel like shit, man.


1674
01:03:01.397 --> 01:03:02.898
I didn't want it to
happen like this.


1675
01:03:02.982 --> 01:03:04.066
Let's just discuss
it some more, okay?


1676
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:05.443
Yeah. Let's just talk, dude.

1677
01:03:05.526 --> 01:03:08.195
We're giving you an option.
It's a choice, man.


1678
01:03:08.279 --> 01:03:10.114
There's nothing to
figure out, all right?


1679
01:03:10.197 --> 01:03:12.867
You guys have said enough, and
there's no going back anymore.


1680
01:03:14.035 --> 01:03:17.038
I don't know if there maybe is, like,
something you guys could give me


1681

asked me not to tell Seth,

him last time I was here.

didn't work out.

You're breathing really loud.
Am I?


1999
01:18:03.715 --> 01:18:04.883
Don't breathe through your mouth.
Okay.

nose breathing. Am I?


2002
01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.973
I don't know where
else to breathe from.


2003
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.726

Oh, shit, he's coming right this way.
Oh, shit.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?


2019
01:18:51.388 --> 01:18:52.889
There's a fuckin'
demon chasing us!


2020
01:18:52.973 --> 01:18:54.558
A demon? Demon?

2021
01:18:54.641 --> 01:18:57.477
What the fuck happened to you guys?
That!


2022

It's Jonah! He's possessed!

01:19:16.705 --> 01:19:18.081
bad news when he wakes up!

2033
01:19:18.164 --> 01:19:20.000
He's fuckin' strong.

2034
01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:21.751
My side's good. Oh, shit!

2035
01:19:21.835 --> 01:19:23.420
All right, <i>I'll</i> fuckin' hit him.

Fuck! Come on, come on! Okay!

2037
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:32.971
This shit's cray cray, guys.

2038
01:19:33.263 --> 01:19:36.224
I mean, it's, like, the
real, like Apocalypse.


2039
01:19:36.308 --> 01:19:38.643
It's, like, the Book
of Revelations,


2040
01:19:38.727 --> 01:19:40.895
like that means there's a God.

2041
01:19:40.979 --> 01:19:42.272
Right?

2042
01:19:42.355 --> 01:19:45.025
I haven't led my life as though
there's a God this whole time.


2043
01:19:45.108 --> 01:19:47.611
Who fuckin' saw that coming?
That there's actually a God?


2044
01:19:47.694 --> 01:19:50.989
I'd say 95% of the planet.

2045
01:19:52.532 --> 01:19:54.659
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

2046
01:19:54.743 --> 01:19:56.786
You might want to stay
away from saying that.


2047
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:59.331
"Jesus fucking Christ"? Why?

2048
01:19:59.456 --> 01:20:01.124
Why can't I say that? One
of the Ten Commandments.


2049
01:20:01.207 --> 01:20:04.044
"Thou shall not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain."


2050
01:20:04.127 --> 01:20:05.545
Jesus isn't the
name of the Lord.


2051
01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:06.838
God is name of the Lord.

2052
01:20:06.921 --> 01:20:08.965
Jesus, God, it's all the same.

2053
01:20:09.049 --> 01:20:11.343
It's the Trinity. Father,
Son, Holy Ghost.


2054
01:20:11.426 --> 01:20:13.303
It's like Neapolitan
ice cream.


2055
01:20:13.386 --> 01:20:15.013
I don't even know what the
fucking Commandments are.


2056
01:20:15.096 --> 01:20:19.225
Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,
because we're all good people.


2057
01:20:19.559 --> 01:20:22.479
I can look at each one of you
in the eye, I know you're good.


2058
01:20:22.562 --> 01:20:24.189
I'm good. We're four actors.

2059
01:20:24.272 --> 01:20:26.232
We bring joy to
people's lives.


2060
01:20:26.316 --> 01:20:28.026
Yeah, but we don't
do it for free.


2061
01:20:28.109 --> 01:20:32.322
We get paid handsomely, much higher
than the average profession.


2062
01:20:32.405 --> 01:20:34.239
It's not like it was just
handed to any of us.


2063
01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.867
We've worked really
hard to be here.


2064
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:38.078
Yeah, pretend like it's
hot when it's cold.

beach, it's freezing,

something, everybody's surfing.

(WHISPERS) I think God
might have just fucked up,


2068
01:20:47.295 --> 01:20:50.340
made a mistake, and left
us behind by accident.


2069
01:20:50.423 --> 01:20:52.384
I mean, He's got a lot
of shit on His plate.


2070
01:20:52.467 --> 01:20:55.553
It's not an oversight,
it's not a mistake, okay?


2071
01:20:55.637 --> 01:20:59.808
We got to face facts. We're here, and
there's a reason we're all here.


2072
01:20:59.891 --> 01:21:02.185
Why are you so sure?

2073
01:21:02.268 --> 01:21:04.354
I've done things, man. I...

2074
01:21:07.482 --> 01:21:09.234
I gouged a man's eyeballs out.

2075

2076

Craig. Well, I was a kid, man.

2077
01:21:12.987 --> 01:21:15.198
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

2078
01:21:15.281 --> 01:21:16.616
It was a bad foosball game.

2079
01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:19.369
He said I didn't call spinneys,
and I fuckin' called spinneys.


2080
01:21:19.452 --> 01:21:22.288
He got all in my face, and I smashed
a bottle across his face...


2081
01:21:23.206 --> 01:21:24.874
(EXHALES DEEPLY) ...and the
first eyeball was an accident,


2082
01:21:24.958 --> 01:21:27.585
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.


2083
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:29.713
It was fucked up.
But you know what?


2084
01:21:29.796 --> 01:21:34.259
That shit happens. I'm saying, that's...
I think that's why I'm here.

01:21:34.342 --> 01:21:36.386
I got to admit something.

2086
01:21:36.469 --> 01:21:37.762
I, uh...

2087
01:21:39.639 --> 01:21:41.057
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

2088
01:21:41.141 --> 01:21:44.018
She was fucked up.
She was high.


2089
01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:45.353
It was at the Chateau Marmont,

2090
01:21:45.437 --> 01:21:46.688
and she kept banging
on my door.

2092

She kept calling me
Jake Gyllenhaal.

01:21:50.024 --> 01:21:51.317
That's fucked up.

2094
01:21:51.401 --> 01:21:54.904
Yeah, I said, "Call me
the Prince of Persia."


2095
01:21:54.988 --> 01:21:56.280
See, that's what
I'm saying, man.


2096
01:21:56.281 --> 01:21:58.241
We've all done bad
shit, you know?


2097
01:21:58.324 --> 01:22:01.911
We've done more bad shit than
good in our lives, and (SIGHS)
