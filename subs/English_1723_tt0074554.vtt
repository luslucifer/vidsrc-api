00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.367
Hi, Howard.

2
00:03:52.943 --> 00:03:55.434
Allie. Jeez.

3
00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:57.671
-How are you?
-What are you doing here?


4
00:03:57.848 --> 00:04:00.510
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Just thought I'd drop in.


5
00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:03.380
God, that's so funny
because, you know...


6
00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:06.546
...I was just thinking about you.
I saw your show on TV.


7
00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:07.713
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.


8
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:10.724
What I had to do to get them
to turn off the ballgame.


9
00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:15.957
This Alfred Miller. He's my friend.
He's a big TV writer.


10
00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.397
This is Margo, the big waitress.

11
00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.628
-How are you?
-Pleased to meet you.


12
00:04:20.804 --> 00:04:24.103
Listen, I thought before the dinner
rush, we could take a walk.


13
00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:26.572
Play a little chess or something.

14
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:30.243
Sure. Marg?

15
00:04:30.414 --> 00:04:33.076
-Can you take over the register?
-Sure, Howard.


16
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.241
I mean, unless you're too busy.

17
00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.546
For you?
Are you kidding?


18
00:04:40.824 --> 00:04:43.349
-It's good to see you.
-You too.


19
00:04:43.527 --> 00:04:45.222
-Hey, Howard.
-Yeah?


20
00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:48.365
What's the price on
the Kid Gavilan-Basilio fight?


21
00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:52.093
-It's 8-to-5, Gavilan.
-I'll take Basilio five times.


22
00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:54.965
Okay, you got it.

23
00:04:57.674 --> 00:04:59.301
You never change.

24
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:05.872
It's your move.

25
00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:09.743
Howard, I can't work anymore.

26
00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:13.279
Yeah?
What, like writer's block?


27
00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:14.981
No.

28
00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.754
-Well, what? You're not sick, are you?
-I'm blacklisted.


29
00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:23.025
-Yeah, all right, but you feel okay.
-I feel terrible.


30
00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:26.192
But you're healthy,
besides your ulcer.


31
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.270
Howard, they won't buy my scripts.

32
00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.930
I'm on a blacklist.
You know what that means?


33
00:05:31.108 --> 00:05:35.477
It's a list of names. The studios have
them, the networks, the ad agencies.


34
00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.479
You're on the list, you're marked.
You don't work.


35
00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:41.140
So, what difference does
it make if I'm healthy?


36
00:05:41.485 --> 00:05:44.215
Well, you know,
it makes a difference.


37
00:05:44.588 --> 00:05:46.715
So, what are you blacklisted for?

38
00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.026
-I'm a communist sympathizer.
-Well, you always were.


39
00:05:53.063 --> 00:05:55.725
Well, it's not so popular anymore.

40
00:05:57.301 --> 00:06:01.169
Hey, how many times have I told you?
Take care of number one.


41
00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:06.202
So, all right, who can you sue?

42
00:06:07.211 --> 00:06:08.701
Nobody.

43
00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.972
Nobody admits there's a blacklist.

44
00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:14.083
I mean, they just say,
"Your script's not good enough."


45
00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:16.981
"You're not right for the assignment."

46
00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:19.349
Hey, I know some people.

47
00:06:19.523 --> 00:06:21.047
They're not exactly people...

48
00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:25.093
...but for $50 they'll break a few legs,
and you're not bothered anymore.


49
00:06:25.262 --> 00:06:27.389
-That's not what I need.
-You need money?


50
00:06:27.564 --> 00:06:30.328
I know a stock which is low now,
but it's going up.


51
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:32.059
I need another name.

52
00:06:37.107 --> 00:06:39.439
Yeah, I can see that.

53
00:06:40.277 --> 00:06:41.972
Rappaport.

54
00:06:42.145 --> 00:06:44.807
-Arnold Rappaport.
-Pseudonyms don't work.


55
00:06:44.982 --> 00:06:48.440
They know we're all changing
our names. I need a real person.


56
00:06:53.357 --> 00:06:54.949
Of course.

57
00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:57.719
Someone they can believe
and I can trust.


58
00:06:57.895 --> 00:07:00.329
-Naturally.
-Now, listen...


59
00:07:00.497 --> 00:07:03.864
-...I wouldn't ask you--
-Who would you ask? I'd be insulted.


60
00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.265
-Nobody would know, just us.
-When do we start?


61
00:07:08.438 --> 00:07:11.771
Wait a minute. You'd better find out
what you're getting into.


62
00:07:11.942 --> 00:07:14.934
-You put my name on your scripts.
-It's not that simple.


63
00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:17.512
I write the scripts,
send them in your name...


64
00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:20.149
-...they buy the scripts, right?
-It's perfect.


65
00:07:20.317 --> 00:07:22.410
-They'll wanna meet the writer.
-So?


66
00:07:22.586 --> 00:07:24.781
You're gonna have to go
and be the writer.


67
00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:27.856
So I'll be the writer.
What's the big deal?


68
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:30.050
I can do it,
and I wanna do it.

69
00:07:30.227 --> 00:07:33.196
I'm your friend. You're in trouble.
What's a friend for?


70
00:07:33.363 --> 00:07:35.854
These days you can get
in trouble being friends.


71
00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:37.295
Life is risk.

72
00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:40.994
-I'm gonna pay you for this, Howard.
-What do you mean "pay"?


73
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:42.263
A friend takes money?

74
00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:45.966
Ten percent from each script
and no arguments.


75
00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:48.777
You can use the money,
you're always in hock...


76
00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:51.005
...and I'd be paying
an agent that anyway.


77
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:53.172
-Ten percent?
-Off the top.


78
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:58.583
-How much do you get for a script?
-$ 750, $ 1 000. It depends on the show.


79
00:07:59.122 --> 00:08:01.522
Go home and write.
Your troubles are over.


80
00:08:01.692 --> 00:08:03.182
What are you pulling here?

81
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.090
You owe me for three winters already.
I'm not charity.


82
00:08:06.263 --> 00:08:08.254
Don't get excited.
Your money's coming.


83
00:08:08.432 --> 00:08:10.627
You book bets, you lose,
you pay off.


84
00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:12.962
What, you don't trust me?
You know--


85
00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:15.001
Don't get me mad on you, you hear?

86
00:08:15.172 --> 00:08:19.040
We've been doing business a long
time, so don't get me mad on you.


87
00:08:23.847 --> 00:08:25.109
<i>I don't understand you.</i>

88
00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:27.716
Do you flush your salary
down the toilet?


89
00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:31.615
No, I had a tip on a stock.
It looked good, so I plunged.


90
00:08:31.788 --> 00:08:35.189
Why don't you ask me?
I'm familiar with the market.


91
00:08:35.359 --> 00:08:38.055
Ask me before you flush
your salary down the toilet.


92
00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:42.130
-All right, next time I'll ask you.
-Howard, what's it gonna be with you?


93
00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.426
Mama and Papa would turn
in their graves.


94
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:48.662
I haven't found myself yet, you know,
but it's all gonna change, Myer.


95
00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:52.240
You were always the smart one.
Did I get the lessons?


96
00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:55.071
You could've gone to college.
Instead you're a bum.


97
00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:57.645
How much this time?

98
00:08:57.814 --> 00:09:01.045
-Six hundred.
-You said on the phone four.


99
00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:03.846
Yeah, I know. Four gets me even,
then I'm blank.


100
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.650
-I'm keeping strict accounts.
-You said four, you get four.


101
00:09:07.824 --> 00:09:11.123
Enough is enough.
I'm at the end of my rope, Howard.


102
00:09:11.294 --> 00:09:13.228
I got a business.

103
00:09:13.397 --> 00:09:15.991
You know what it costs now
to feed one lousy mink?


104
00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:18.157
-You know what a cutter gets?
-Thanks--


105
00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:22.396
If you were realizing your potential,
I'd say, "Fine, that's an investment."


106
00:09:22.572 --> 00:09:25.632
-I'm working on it, Myer.
-At that cockamamie job you got?


107
00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:27.743
You call that a job,
with your head?


108
00:09:27.911 --> 00:09:30.675
-I think you're gonna be surprised.
-I'm serious.


109
00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:32.906
The well is running dry.

110
00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:34.880
Sink or swim.

111
00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:40.251
<i>--$500. The winner, number three,</i>
<i>Mr. Turf, ridden by William Boland....</i>

116
00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:00.941
Well, who wants him?

117
00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:04.604
Who? Florence Barrett?

118
00:10:05.115 --> 00:10:06.946
What do you look like?

119
00:10:07.984 --> 00:10:11.215
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
This is-- That's right.


120
00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:14.084
This is Howard Prince, the writer.

121
00:10:15.592 --> 00:10:17.423
No kidding, did you?

122
00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:19.653
Yeah, you liked it?

123
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.931
Sure. No, I can meet--
Afternoons are fine.


124
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:29.061
You know, I use the evenings to write
because there's less noise.


125
00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:32.640
Okay, great.
Tuesday's perfect.


126
00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:35.300
Right. Ciao.

127
00:10:39.549 --> 00:10:40.777
<i>Yes, Old Gold...</i>

128
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:44.182
<i>...the cigarette with nearly 200 years</i>
<i>of tobacco know-how....</i>


129
00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:46.219
Florence Barrett.

130
00:10:46.823 --> 00:10:47.983
The one with the hair.

131
00:10:48.325 --> 00:10:49.815
I won't tell him, Phil.

132
00:10:49.993 --> 00:10:52.257
You're the producer.
Do your own dirty work.


133
00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:55.489
-All Hecky has to do is talk to the man.
-Why should he?


134
00:10:55.665 --> 00:10:58.862
Who is this creep anyway?
Just because he works for the FBl?


135
00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:01.367
Where does he come off
clearing anyone?


136
00:11:01.538 --> 00:11:03.938
-It's for Hecky's own good.
-I'm against it.


137
00:11:04.107 --> 00:11:06.166
-I'm against it too.
-Then do something.


138
00:11:06.343 --> 00:11:08.777
I don't run the network.

139
00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:10.708
Can I help you?

140
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:13.577
-I'm Howard Prince.
-Who?


141
00:11:14.217 --> 00:11:15.377
You're Howard Prince.

142
00:11:15.552 --> 00:11:17.952
I'm Florence Barrett.
I'm glad you could come.


143
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:21.386
This is Howard Prince, the writer.
Phil Sussman, our producer.


144
00:11:21.558 --> 00:11:24.527
-How do you do?
-Sorry, I didn't connect the name.


145
00:11:24.694 --> 00:11:27.390
That's a hell of a script.
Where've you been hiding?


146
00:11:27.564 --> 00:11:30.465
We looked you up.
No credits, just out of the blue.


147
00:11:30.634 --> 00:11:33.398
Well, I just took up writing
a short while ago.


148
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.061
Well, that's one hell of a script.
You got more?


149
00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:37.900
Are you kidding?

150
00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:39.564
Howard Prince.

151
00:11:39.743 --> 00:11:41.904
This is Steve Parks,
the lead in the show.


152
00:11:42.078 --> 00:11:43.602
-Marvelous script.
-Thank you.


153
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.748
-Hecky Brown.
-Who plays with himself.


154
00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:49.181
-Who plays the narrator.
-Howie! Howie Prince!


155
00:11:49.352 --> 00:11:51.013
They let you out, finally.

156
00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:53.816
Darling, darling, darling.
I've waited for you.


157
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.322
I was faithful to you.
It's been so long.


158
00:11:56.493 --> 00:12:00.156
-You know each other?
-Never saw this man before in my life.


159
00:12:00.764 --> 00:12:03.198
Seriously, Mr. Prince,
a first-class script.


160
00:12:03.366 --> 00:12:05.095
Thank you.
Thank you very much.


161
00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:09.034
We don't have much time. That's why
I asked you to come right away.


162
00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:11.731
-We wanted to meet you--
-Your script's a little long.


163
00:12:11.908 --> 00:12:15.241
-Four and a half minutes.
-I suggest cutting the kitchen scene.


164
00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:17.744
-I don't know how--
-I think it's a mistake.


165
00:12:17.914 --> 00:12:21.077
To me, the awkward scene
is the one in the police station.


166
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.946
Don't you think?

167
00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:27.522
Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.
You know...


168
00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:30.159
...it depends on your definition
of awkward.


169
00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:32.124
The police station has violence.

170
00:12:32.295 --> 00:12:35.628
I'm not saying eliminate it.
I just think it can be trimmed.


171
00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:37.994
What do you think, Mr. Prince?

172
00:12:41.438 --> 00:12:42.837
What?

173
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.600
Yeah.

174
00:12:44.774 --> 00:12:46.571
"Yeah" what?

175
00:12:47.377 --> 00:12:49.641
You know, I think that....

176
00:12:49.813 --> 00:12:52.543
I think that what--
There's a lot of facets here...


177
00:12:52.716 --> 00:12:56.083
...and I don't wanna just answer
right off the top of my head...


178
00:12:56.253 --> 00:13:00.121
...because I don't think it would be
fair to you or fair to the show.


179
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.420
Howard, I know it's not fun to cut your
script, but television is television.


180
00:13:04.594 --> 00:13:05.925
You decide and you cut.

181
00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:09.759
I don't disembowel a writer's script.
I believe in the written word.


182
00:13:09.933 --> 00:13:13.232
-Absolutely.
-I need it tomorrow morning.


183
00:13:13.403 --> 00:13:15.337
But you be happy with it.

184
00:13:24.915 --> 00:13:29.113
-I really liked your script a lot.
-Oh, yeah? Thank you very much.


185
00:13:29.286 --> 00:13:31.880
Most of the stuff I read....

186
00:13:32.689 --> 00:13:35.123
I mean yours had substance.

187
00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:36.850
It was about people.

188
00:13:37.027 --> 00:13:40.190
Well, I feel if you're gonna write
about human beings...


189
00:13:40.363 --> 00:13:44.561
...that you may as well
make them people.


190
00:13:45.802 --> 00:13:45.869
Freedom lnformation Service.

191
00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:47.803
Freedom lnformation Service.

192
00:13:47.971 --> 00:13:49.563
Who's calling?

193
00:13:49.739 --> 00:13:51.934
One moment, please.

194
00:13:55.011 --> 00:13:57.571
<i>Mr. Hampton from the network.</i>

195
00:13:58.448 --> 00:14:00.211
Hennessy.

196
00:14:00.383 --> 00:14:02.283
Yes, Tom.

197
00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:04.386
Yes, of course.

198
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:07.319
First name: Howard.

199
00:14:08.091 --> 00:14:10.184
You got an address on him?

200
00:14:11.227 --> 00:14:13.491
Social Security number?

201
00:14:14.864 --> 00:14:16.456
I'll check him right out.

202
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.358
No, it's no trouble at all, Tom.
That's what you're paying me for.


203
00:14:20.904 --> 00:14:22.895
Yes, he's right here right now.

204
00:14:23.073 --> 00:14:25.598
I'm sure we'll work something out.

205
00:14:27.043 --> 00:14:30.376
I'll get back to you as soon
as I know anything about Prince.


206
00:14:30.547 --> 00:14:33.209
You too, Tom.
Carry on.


207
00:14:35.318 --> 00:14:37.843
-Sorry, Mr. Brown.
-Hecky.


208
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:40.216
Everybody calls me Hecky.

209
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.824
I'm a household name.

210
00:14:43.093 --> 00:14:47.223
I can't guarantee anything, but if you
tell the truth, I might be able to help.


211
00:14:47.397 --> 00:14:50.059
I'll tell you the truth.
I'll do anything.


212
00:14:51.234 --> 00:14:54.203
The question is, Mr. Brown,
what have you done?


213
00:14:54.571 --> 00:14:56.596
Nothing. I'm an actor.

214
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.600
Nothing?

215
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:04.007
Six years ago,
I marched in the May Day Parade.


216
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:12.053
I bought a <i>Daily Worker</i> subscription.
But I never read it, not one word.


217
00:15:12.222 --> 00:15:14.417
Right from the mailbox
to the garbage can.


218
00:15:16.793 --> 00:15:18.420
I was only trying to get laid.

219
00:15:18.595 --> 00:15:20.825
This communist girl,
she had a big ass--


220
00:15:20.997 --> 00:15:23.591
I am not interested
in your sex life, Mr. Brown.


221
00:15:23.767 --> 00:15:28.204
Hecky. I was just telling you
that girl was the reason.


222
00:15:29.372 --> 00:15:32.808
Was she also the reason you signed
a petition for Loyalist Spain?


223
00:15:32.976 --> 00:15:36.241
-Did I do that?
-And Russian war relief.


224
00:15:36.413 --> 00:15:39.177
We were on the same side,
weren't we?


225
00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:46.015
That girl with the big ass,
she was the reason. Honest.


226
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:48.657
Would you say then
that you were duped?


227
00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:51.217
Tell me what it means,
and I'll say it.


228
00:15:51.394 --> 00:15:53.328
You want it in writing?
Tell me.


229
00:15:53.496 --> 00:15:56.158
-It has to come from you, Mr. Brown.
-Hecky.


230
00:15:56.699 --> 00:15:59.327
From your heart.
It has no value, otherwise.


231
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.461
It'll come. Don't worry.

232
00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:05.608
I'm an actor.
What do I know about politics?


233
00:16:05.775 --> 00:16:07.766
My whole life has been acting.

234
00:16:07.944 --> 00:16:10.606
People from all over the country
write me letters.


235
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.611
Write me a letter, Mr. Brown.

236
00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:14.710
In your own words.

237
00:16:14.884 --> 00:16:17.045
How you were duped,
how you feel about it.


238
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.347
I'm against it 100 percent.

239
00:16:19.622 --> 00:16:21.783
Whoever else you remember
in that parade.


240
00:16:22.192 --> 00:16:24.217
Who asked you to sign
those petitions.


241
00:16:24.394 --> 00:16:28.296
-It was such a long time ago.
-Try to remember.


242
00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:30.899
Sincerity is the key, Mr. Brown.

243
00:16:31.067 --> 00:16:34.332
Anyone can make a mistake.
The man who repents sincerely--


244
00:16:34.504 --> 00:16:39.203
-I repent sincerely.
-Write me the letter, Mr. Brown.


245
00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:41.536
I'll see what I can do.

246
00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:51.620
And I didn't even get laid.

247
00:16:58.862 --> 00:17:01.296
<i>Stand by, everybody.</i>
<i>We have 30 seconds to air.</i>


248
00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:01.531
Can I see opening shots, please?
Camera one.


249
00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:05.592
Can I see opening shots, please?
Camera one.


250
00:17:05.768 --> 00:17:09.295
Fine. Two's good.
Three, frame up, please. Tilt up.


251
00:17:09.472 --> 00:17:12.339
That's it. It looks good.
Watch the boom.


252
00:17:14.577 --> 00:17:17.808
All right, stand by to dim the lights.

253
00:17:19.382 --> 00:17:23.250
And, okay, dim them down.

254
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.654
Looks nice.
Ten...


255
00:17:25.822 --> 00:17:27.517
...nine, eight...

256
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.920
...seven, six...

257
00:17:30.093 --> 00:17:35.497
...five, four, three, two, one.

258
00:17:35.665 --> 00:17:37.428
And fade up on three.

259
00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:40.399
<i>This is my station,</i>
<i>Grand Central...</i>


260
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.164
<i>...where a million stories</i>
<i>start and finish.</i>


261
00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:46.035
<i>And Hecky the Hackie</i>
<i>knows them all.</i>


262
00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:48.734
<i>Tonight, have I got a story for you.</i>

263
00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:52.911
<i>Remember last week you laughed</i>
<i>a lot? Tonight you may cry a little.</i>


264
00:17:53.082 --> 00:17:55.710
<i>See for yourself on</i>
Grand Central.


265
00:17:55.885 --> 00:17:57.375
<i>Me?</i>

266
00:17:57.554 --> 00:17:59.317
<i>I'll go make up with my cab.</i>

267
00:17:59.489 --> 00:18:01.150
<i>See you later.</i>

268
00:18:08.598 --> 00:18:11.431
<i>Joey.</i>

269
00:18:11.601 --> 00:18:13.262
<i>Joey?</i>

270
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.303
<i>Pa.</i>

271
00:18:16.439 --> 00:18:19.033
<i>Pa, it's only $4000.</i>

272
00:18:19.209 --> 00:18:21.109
<i>Why, it's almost nothing.</i>

273
00:18:21.277 --> 00:18:23.472
<i>I can pay you back</i>
<i>in a couple of years.</i>


274
00:18:24.714 --> 00:18:26.739
Looks nice.

275
00:18:27.984 --> 00:18:30.612
And ready to one.

276
00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:33.153
Right and tight close-up.

277
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.389
Stand by to go to black.

278
00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:37.822
Thirty seconds to credit.

279
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:40.095
Studio 12.

280
00:18:40.263 --> 00:18:41.787
Yes.

281
00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:45.332
Thank you. I thought so too.
It was terrific. Thank you.


282
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:49.028
-Who was it?
-Studio 12.


283
00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:50.763
God.

284
00:18:51.307 --> 00:18:52.797
Hello.

285
00:18:52.976 --> 00:18:54.341
Well, thank you.

286
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.876
Yes, thank you very much.

287
00:18:57.046 --> 00:18:59.173
Yes, I'll tell everybody.

288
00:18:59.349 --> 00:19:03.115
-Well, I think we got a winner.
-Studio 12.


289
00:19:32.482 --> 00:19:36.009
I usually don't drink wine at lunch.
It makes me sleepy.


290
00:19:36.185 --> 00:19:38.915
Yeah? So why don't you just
take a nap after?


291
00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:40.817
I have to work.

292
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.891
Well, then, I think we should
go out on a Sunday night.


293
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.460
I think it'd be better.
You don't like Sunday.


294
00:19:46.629 --> 00:19:49.564
So, what about Saturday?
What about Friday?


295
00:19:49.732 --> 00:19:51.393
Regular night?

296
00:19:51.834 --> 00:19:55.235
Howard, I really ought to tell you,
I'm involved.


297
00:19:55.405 --> 00:19:57.373
What does that mean?
You married?


298
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.065
No, but involved.

299
00:20:00.243 --> 00:20:02.734
So what? You tell me that
you're one of those...


300
00:20:02.912 --> 00:20:06.370
..."one guy at a time" people?

301
00:20:06.749 --> 00:20:08.683
Yeah, okay.
Here's what I say to you:


302
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:13.015
We go out, don't bring him along.
Right?


303
00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:16.852
Okay, so what does he do?
What, is he a writer?


304
00:20:17.026 --> 00:20:19.893
-What, a musician? What?
-Stockbroker.


305
00:20:20.063 --> 00:20:24.227
A stockbroker?
Well, that's interesting. You know.


306
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.197
He's very nice.

307
00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:30.965
Yeah, I was not knocking it, you know,
because you do what you can do.


308
00:20:32.175 --> 00:20:34.973
I gotta ask you,
did you see my new script?


309
00:20:35.144 --> 00:20:37.704
Marvelous.
It's even better than the last one.


310
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.246
Well, you should see the next one.

311
00:20:40.717 --> 00:20:45.450
It's very exciting for me to watch
a new talent emerging.


312
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:47.987
May I ask you a personal question?

313
00:20:48.391 --> 00:20:50.325
Sure, feel free.

314
00:20:50.493 --> 00:20:53.326
Why did you start writing so late?

315
00:20:54.297 --> 00:20:57.824
Well, because in order to write--

316
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.628
Excuse me.
You gotta get experience.


317
00:21:00.803 --> 00:21:03.670
And you gotta live,
and life is experience...


318
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.298
...so I had to, you know,
get that experience.


319
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.171
Well, here in the city? You do
come from here, don't you?


320
00:21:11.347 --> 00:21:14.680
Yeah, but I bummed around a lot.
I was a boxer and a seaman...


321
00:21:14.851 --> 00:21:17.115
...and all that stuff
you gotta be to write.


322
00:21:17.286 --> 00:21:20.483
-What, you don't believe me?
-Well, should I?


323
00:21:20.656 --> 00:21:24.353
No, but I did bum around a lot.
What about you?


324
00:21:24.694 --> 00:21:25.991
Not a lot.

325
00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:28.357
No, I didn't mean it that way,
you know.


326
00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:32.562
-Where are you from?
-Connecticut.


327
00:21:32.935 --> 00:21:36.598
-That's very ritzy.
-It's very proper, anyway.


328
00:21:36.773 --> 00:21:38.468
I was very well-bred.

329
00:21:38.641 --> 00:21:42.407
The kind of family where the biggest
sin was to raise your voice.


330
00:21:42.578 --> 00:21:47.174
Oh, yeah? In my family the biggest
sin was to buy retail.


331
00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:52.644
-Well, do you guys laugh a lot?
-Who?


332
00:21:52.822 --> 00:21:55.552
You know, you and the stockbroker?

333
00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:58.254
Yes.

334
00:21:58.661 --> 00:21:59.992
Thank you.

335
00:22:04.534 --> 00:22:07.628
The character of the girl
in your script....


336
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:11.929
You write about women so well,
with such understanding.


337
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.240
Hey, this is all à la carte.

338
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.049
So, what about tomorrow night?

339
00:22:24.353 --> 00:22:26.321
I'd have to tell him.

340
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.315
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

341
00:22:29.492 --> 00:22:33.758
Come on. So you go out with me once,
and then you'll know better.


342
00:22:35.031 --> 00:22:37.465
What?
What are you laughing at?


343
00:22:37.633 --> 00:22:39.396
You're so unexpected.

344
00:22:39.569 --> 00:22:42.060
Well, I didn't expect you either.

345
00:22:42.238 --> 00:22:43.933
You call yourself a writer?

346
00:22:44.106 --> 00:22:46.904
Modern American writing started
with <i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>


347
00:22:47.076 --> 00:22:48.600
-It did?
-Hemingway said that.


348
00:22:48.778 --> 00:22:50.939
How about Hemingway?
You're low on moderns.


349
00:22:51.113 --> 00:22:53.707
-Faulkner, Anderson, Fitzgerald.
-All right...


350
00:22:53.883 --> 00:22:56.113
...give me two Hemingways
and a Faulkner.


351
00:22:56.285 --> 00:22:59.721
Faulkner. Hemingway....
There we are.


352
00:22:59.889 --> 00:23:03.689
The Russians.
<i>Brothers Karamazov</i>.


353
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.489
-No more Dostoyevsky?
-What else you got?


354
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.493
<i>-Diary of a Writer.</i>
-Oh, yeah? I can use that.


355
00:23:11.667 --> 00:23:13.828
Remember, Howard,
you gotta pay for these.


356
00:23:14.003 --> 00:23:15.561
-No credit.
-Don't worry.


357
00:23:15.738 --> 00:23:19.174
Listen, Danny, I got hit
very hard last week.


358
00:23:19.342 --> 00:23:22.072
Long shots come in like relatives.

359
00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:24.770
Well, soon.

360
00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:27.814
Soon is soon.
Tomorrow, the day after.


361
00:23:27.984 --> 00:23:32.944
Danny, what are you mad about?
It's a promise. Trust me.


362
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.020
Come on, Myer.
Jesus, I'm still an unknown.


363
00:23:37.193 --> 00:23:39.718
What am I talking about?
Five thousand, probably.


364
00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:41.625
You're making as much as I am.

365
00:23:41.797 --> 00:23:45.130
That's how much you know.
Where's taxes and agents?


366
00:23:45.301 --> 00:23:46.791
I gotta buy books and paper.

367
00:23:46.969 --> 00:23:49.403
Money goes through you
like Epsom salts.


368
00:23:49.572 --> 00:23:52.632
-You're a sick individual.
-I'll pay you back.


369
00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:56.209
-I just sold another script.
-Don't play me for a sucker, Howard.


370
00:23:56.379 --> 00:23:58.643
<i>A man earns and you still borrows?</i>

371
00:23:58.814 --> 00:24:00.805
<i>First you pay back what you owe.</i>

372
00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:03.383
My dad's in the study.

373
00:24:09.725 --> 00:24:12.626
-You want a drink?
-Me? No, thanks.


374
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.727
-You look tired.
-Yeah, this was a tough one.


375
00:24:18.334 --> 00:24:21.462
Shit, they're all tough.
But it turned out good, I think.


376
00:24:21.637 --> 00:24:23.832
You really work hard,
don't you?


377
00:24:24.006 --> 00:24:27.567
It's a terrible thing, that blacklist.
You having to work like this.


378
00:24:27.743 --> 00:24:31.008
I always work like this.
To work.


379
00:24:31.747 --> 00:24:35.376
I was thinking, there must be a lot
of writers who are blacklisted.


380
00:24:35.551 --> 00:24:38.076
-So how do they get along?
-Why?


381
00:24:39.355 --> 00:24:41.448
I don't know.
You know, it must be hard.


382
00:24:43.326 --> 00:24:44.486
Yeah, it's hard.

383
00:24:45.795 --> 00:24:48.320
You know, it's funny.
I got them so snowed.


384
00:24:48.497 --> 00:24:51.193
I mean, two writers wouldn't be
any harder than one.


385
00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:53.358
Oh, yeah? You think not?

386
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.165
What do you have to know?
It's a cinch.


387
00:24:56.339 --> 00:24:58.068
Why not three?

388
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.209
-Yeah, even three.
-Ten percent each.


389
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:04.478
Well, I don't know.
I could do three for 25.


390
00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:09.809
-I wouldn't want you to feel cheated.
-All right, make it 10 percent each.


391
00:25:12.455 --> 00:25:16.221
-You don't think that's fair?
-Oh, no, I think it's a bargain.


392
00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:19.255
Hey, I got the time.
You know writers who need help.


393
00:25:19.428 --> 00:25:21.988
-I'm willing to help.
-Oh, cut the crap, Howard.


394
00:25:22.164 --> 00:25:24.997
I'm running around every place.
I gotta take taxis.


395
00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:27.567
-I gotta keep up appearances.
-You want money.


396
00:25:27.737 --> 00:25:30.501
I'm offering a deal.
Are you some kind of romantic?


397
00:25:30.673 --> 00:25:33.801
That's the trouble with leftos.
You got a thing about money.


398
00:25:33.976 --> 00:25:36.536
-You want the deal or not?
-I do, but I know you.


399
00:25:36.712 --> 00:25:38.873
You'll take off
and fly up your own ass.


400
00:25:39.048 --> 00:25:40.913
I'm willing to help.
Take advantage.


401
00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:44.644
-All I can say, Howard, is thanks.
-Yeah, it's no trouble.


402
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.618
I'm a communist.
I want you to know that right off.


403
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.554
The committee asked me.
I took the Fifth.


404
00:25:50.726 --> 00:25:53.422
-But I'm telling you.
-It's none of my business.


405
00:25:53.596 --> 00:25:55.723
You should know who
you're fronting for.


406
00:25:55.898 --> 00:25:57.058
I don't have to know.

407
00:25:57.233 --> 00:25:59.133
They're trying to sell the cold war.

408
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:01.792
They use the blacklist
on those who won't buy.


409
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:03.666
Herb, he doesn't need a lecture.

410
00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:07.070
-I'll send you pamphlets.
-I'll break your arm. Leave him alone.


411
00:26:07.243 --> 00:26:10.235
-He knows who he's mixed up with.
-Who's mixed up?


412
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.441
We're not blacklisted because
we're kind to dumb animals.


413
00:26:14.617 --> 00:26:17.484
Or because somebody lied
about us or made a mistake.


414
00:26:17.653 --> 00:26:20.588
I know, you're out of work.
That's all I have to know.


415
00:26:20.756 --> 00:26:23.190
What about taxes?
That's gonna be a problem.


416
00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:26.385
You need a deductible?
Take my advice: natural gas.


417
00:26:26.562 --> 00:26:29.030
-Yeah, I heard cattle.
-Cattle is also good.


418
00:26:29.498 --> 00:26:31.022
Filet of sole.

419
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.431
Vegetable cutlet.
Mushroom omelet.


420
00:26:34.603 --> 00:26:38.004
Protose steak.
Eat in good health.


421
00:26:40.176 --> 00:26:44.169
All right, the network pays him, he
pays us. Less the 10 percent, right?


422
00:26:44.346 --> 00:26:46.814
Then we just pay all the taxes
that we owe.


423
00:26:46.982 --> 00:26:48.574
Nothing illegal.
No tricks.


424
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:50.912
Everybody declares exactly
what he earned.


425
00:26:51.087 --> 00:26:53.851
What's he paying us for?
Gotta put something down.


426
00:26:54.023 --> 00:26:55.320
We're his collaborators.

427
00:26:55.491 --> 00:26:58.654
Anyone reads the returns
connects him with us.


428
00:26:58.828 --> 00:27:00.796
Can't we protect him better?

429
00:27:00.963 --> 00:27:04.194
The IRS isn't gonna care as long
as the right tax is paid.


430
00:27:04.366 --> 00:27:07.335
The FBl will. And they've been
looking at tax returns.


431
00:27:08.637 --> 00:27:11.401
Only in political cases.
He's not political.


432
00:27:11.574 --> 00:27:12.734
You guys kill me.

433
00:27:12.908 --> 00:27:16.901
They're beating your brains out,
and you're worried about taxes?


434
00:27:17.079 --> 00:27:19.547
We're worried about you.

435
00:27:19.715 --> 00:27:21.273
Don't worry about me, okay?

436
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.908
<i>Just write the script.</i>
<i>I'll take care of my end.</i>


437
00:27:25.087 --> 00:27:27.954
Five pounds, sweetheart.
Have a nice day.


438
00:27:28.624 --> 00:27:30.148
Cash.

439
00:27:31.694 --> 00:27:33.355
Three hundred?

440
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.966
Howard, have an orange.

441
00:27:40.469 --> 00:27:42.960
-Thanks, Uncle Howard.
-Thank you, Uncle Howard.


442
00:27:43.139 --> 00:27:45.004
Thank you, Howard.

443
00:27:47.777 --> 00:27:49.210
I'm Harry Stone, the actor.

444
00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:51.608
Harry Stone, the director,
is who you want.


445
00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:54.477
-I'm blacklisted. They think I'm him.
-I understand.


446
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.175
I never joined anything.
It's a terrible mistake.


447
00:27:57.353 --> 00:27:59.651
I can only help people
who are willing...


448
00:27:59.822 --> 00:28:01.756
...to clear up what they've done.

449
00:28:01.924 --> 00:28:05.587
-But I haven't done anything.
-That's why I can't help you.


450
00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:12.864
<i>-Mr. Hampton from the network.</i>
-Thank you.


451
00:28:13.035 --> 00:28:14.730
Yes, Tom.

452
00:28:14.904 --> 00:28:17.737
Yes, I've got a report
on Howard Prince.


453
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.201
No, no proof he's a member
of the party.


454
00:28:20.376 --> 00:28:22.503
Of course, no proof that he isn't.

455
00:28:22.812 --> 00:28:25.576
I suggest I keep investigating.

456
00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:28.373
Well, no, I don't have to.

457
00:28:28.551 --> 00:28:30.416
I can send you a bill
and forget it.


458
00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:33.384
You're the one who has to answer
to the American people.


459
00:28:34.123 --> 00:28:35.556
Exactly.

460
00:28:35.724 --> 00:28:39.455
That's all I'm saying.
You can't be too careful these days.


461
00:28:41.163 --> 00:28:45.156
No, I don't suppose anyone can
object if you keep using him.


462
00:28:45.334 --> 00:28:46.733
Nothing to object to...

463
00:28:47.369 --> 00:28:48.700
<i>...so far.</i>

464
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:50.361
Thank you.

465
00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:53.406
-You can use him.
-Thank God.


466
00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:57.444
He's the best writer I've got.
Hell, he's the only writer I've got.


467
00:28:57.613 --> 00:28:59.581
I don't know how he does it.

468
00:29:00.983 --> 00:29:03.850
What about Hecky Brown?
He wrote the letter.


469
00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:05.816
It wasn't good enough.

470
00:29:05.988 --> 00:29:08.980
It's not my decision, Phil.
They tell me, I tell you.


471
00:29:09.158 --> 00:29:10.352
What do I tell Hecky?

472
00:29:10.526 --> 00:29:12.721
You decided he's not right
for the part.


473
00:29:12.895 --> 00:29:15.261
You've changed the character.

474
00:29:15.965 --> 00:29:19.423
You've fired actors before.
Tell him what you told them.


475
00:29:19.602 --> 00:29:21.661
He'll know it's not true.

476
00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:24.195
Can he prove it?

477
00:29:34.717 --> 00:29:37.379
-I should get back to the office.
-What's the rush?


478
00:29:37.553 --> 00:29:40.681
You're having a script conference.
That takes time.


479
00:29:40.856 --> 00:29:43.154
Then we ought to talk
about the script.


480
00:29:43.325 --> 00:29:45.953
Later. Come on.

481
00:29:47.363 --> 00:29:50.127
Hey, what's the matter?

482
00:29:50.966 --> 00:29:55.335
You're the only writer I know who
never wants to talk about his work.


483
00:29:55.504 --> 00:29:58.905
-I'm superstitious.
-No, you're not.


484
00:29:59.074 --> 00:30:03.636
Yeah, I am. The way I see it,
you're either a writer or a talker.


485
00:30:03.812 --> 00:30:08.146
You're genuinely modest.
I admire that.


486
00:30:09.518 --> 00:30:10.815
Well--

487
00:30:11.186 --> 00:30:14.178
Well, do you like sports?

488
00:30:14.356 --> 00:30:17.416
-I'm embarrassing you.
-No. Do you--? I'm serious.


489
00:30:17.593 --> 00:30:19.686
What do you think of sports?

490
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:22.088
I like swimming.

491
00:30:22.264 --> 00:30:25.199
No, swimming's not a sport.
You swim so you don't drown.


492
00:30:25.367 --> 00:30:28.336
You know, sport is what
you play with a ball.


493
00:30:28.504 --> 00:30:30.938
I used to play basketball in school.

494
00:30:31.106 --> 00:30:33.336
You play basketball?

495
00:30:34.576 --> 00:30:39.172
Yeah? You'd be interested maybe
in playing one-on-one sometime?


496
00:30:39.348 --> 00:30:42.283
Or, you know, if you
ever wanna lay a bet, I'm--


497
00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:45.643
Jesus, forget that.

498
00:30:48.891 --> 00:30:50.483
Hey...

499
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.619
...you know, I'm--

500
00:30:53.796 --> 00:30:57.095
You know, I'm not just a writer.

501
00:30:57.433 --> 00:30:59.128
I mean, I--

502
00:30:59.301 --> 00:31:01.633
I want you to--

503
00:31:01.804 --> 00:31:04.637
-I want you to know--
-I know.


504
00:31:06.608 --> 00:31:08.576
You know?

505
00:31:08.844 --> 00:31:11.312
How I feel about you.

506
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.445
That's what you know?

507
00:31:13.882 --> 00:31:16.680
I don't have to know anything more.

508
00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:58.684
It's first-class.

509
00:32:03.832 --> 00:32:05.993
You know, I've never seen
an account like yours.


510
00:32:06.168 --> 00:32:10.571
Up and down, up and down. One
week a big deposit, the next week--


511
00:32:10.739 --> 00:32:14.573
If you don't mind my asking,
what does a man like you do?


512
00:32:15.344 --> 00:32:17.244
Futures.

513
00:32:43.005 --> 00:32:44.836
Mr. Delaney.

514
00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:50.777
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.
We'd like to talk to you.


515
00:32:50.946 --> 00:32:54.643
-I've got nothing to say to you.
-Thought you'd be ready to cooperate.


516
00:32:54.817 --> 00:32:56.546
Nobody has to know.

517
00:32:59.755 --> 00:33:02.155
See you again, Mr. Delaney.

518
00:33:15.003 --> 00:33:16.265
Keep walking.

519
00:33:56.478 --> 00:33:58.241
You're here!

520
00:33:58.614 --> 00:34:01.139
He's here!
We've been trying all over.


521
00:34:01.316 --> 00:34:02.681
-Thank God.
-What's the matter?


522
00:34:02.851 --> 00:34:05.285
-I said I'd bring it to you today.
-Forget that one.


523
00:34:05.454 --> 00:34:08.150
-What do you mean, forget it?
-I said, forget it.


524
00:34:08.323 --> 00:34:10.257
-Rewrite the old one.
-What old one?


525
00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:12.689
The one with flashbacks
to the concentration camp.


526
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:14.453
-You said it was great.
-Beautiful.


527
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.996
-Florence said she cried.
-An award-winning show.


528
00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:19.327
-I cried at the gas chamber scenes.
-Then?


529
00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:21.628
The sponsor won't approve it.

530
00:34:24.406 --> 00:34:26.874
-You found him.
-First, they said yes. Now it's no.


531
00:34:27.042 --> 00:34:29.135
You want to know why?
It's unbelievable.


532
00:34:29.311 --> 00:34:32.246
They're a gas company. They decided
the show makes gas look bad.


533
00:34:32.414 --> 00:34:35.212
We can make it a firing squad.
They killed Jews that way too.


534
00:34:35.384 --> 00:34:37.648
-Leave it to Howard.
-What is the excitement?


535
00:34:37.819 --> 00:34:40.913
They want changes, make it
a firing squad. It's a good idea.


536
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:42.681
-Write new scenes.
-I'll go home--


537
00:34:42.858 --> 00:34:45.292
-You don't have time to go home.
-I'll take a cab.


538
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.826
You don't realize,
time is of the essence!


539
00:34:47.996 --> 00:34:51.295
Look at us. We're stuck here! They're
waiting upstairs for the rewrite.


540
00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:54.526
The network, the sponsor.
They don't approve, there is no show!


541
00:34:54.736 --> 00:34:57.000
-They can't wait till tonight?
-They want it now.


542
00:34:57.172 --> 00:35:01.074
-I must keep you here until it's done.
-No. I can't write except in my room.


543
00:35:01.243 --> 00:35:03.711
We got a good office.
You will not be disturbed.


544
00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:06.939
-No, I don't get inspired.
-It doesn't have to be inspiring.


545
00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:10.448
There isn't much writing. We have
to be careful not to lose the emotion.


546
00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:13.713
Don't bother him with details.
He's got a lot of work to do.


547
00:35:14.122 --> 00:35:15.783
Come on in.

548
00:35:16.091 --> 00:35:19.788
Now, clear your mind and write.

549
00:36:46.815 --> 00:36:50.273
Quiet, children. Quiet.

550
00:36:50.986 --> 00:36:56.652
Boys and girls, we have a very special
visitor to our assembly today.


551
00:36:57.092 --> 00:37:02.792
Not long ago, he sat in the same seats
you're sitting in now.


552
00:37:02.964 --> 00:37:04.693
But because he worked hard...

553
00:37:05.367 --> 00:37:07.335
...and studied hard...

554
00:37:07.502 --> 00:37:11.939
...he is now
a famous television writer.


555
00:37:25.387 --> 00:37:27.150
Hecky...

556
00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:30.155
...I don't know how to say this,
but I'm worried.


557
00:37:30.325 --> 00:37:32.691
I'm not the only one, upstairs too.

558
00:37:32.861 --> 00:37:34.260
Worried about what?

559
00:37:34.429 --> 00:37:37.421
-Here, Sussman, take a pickle.
-No, no.


560
00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:40.033
-The show is a smash.
-Yeah, well so far.


561
00:37:40.202 --> 00:37:42.102
So far, so good.

562
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.760
I gotta look ahead, Hecky.

563
00:37:43.939 --> 00:37:47.636
Your quality, I don't know,
the character's not working.


564
00:37:47.809 --> 00:37:49.572
I made up the character.
You loved it.


565
00:37:49.745 --> 00:37:52.305
First impression was tremendous.
Don't get me wrong.


566
00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:54.472
-You think so too?
-It's not her decision.


567
00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:57.015
-What decision?
-I think you're wonderful, Hecky.


568
00:37:57.185 --> 00:37:59.119
So does everyone else.

569
00:38:00.021 --> 00:38:02.854
No one denies your talent. It's....

570
00:38:03.058 --> 00:38:05.492
Your personality is too dominant.

571
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.925
You belong out front,
like Berle, in one.


572
00:38:09.097 --> 00:38:12.032
In a dramatic series, you're
throwing the show off balance.


573
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.102
-Who says?
-A talent like yours needs room.


574
00:38:16.438 --> 00:38:19.874
You know what you need? A show
of your own, where you can dominate.


575
00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:21.804
As a matter of fact,
I got a few ideas.


576
00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:25.276
We'll make some time,
get together and kick them around.


577
00:38:27.582 --> 00:38:29.641
-Is it the letter?
-Absolutely not.


578
00:38:29.818 --> 00:38:32.514
-I wrote what that snake asked me to.
-Wouldn't I tell you?


579
00:38:32.687 --> 00:38:34.348
The problem is artistic.

580
00:38:35.991 --> 00:38:38.459
Female of the species.

581
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.730
<i>No, I think you have to safely say</i>
<i>that</i> Grand Central...


582
00:38:41.735 --> 00:38:44.198
<i>No, I think you have to safely say</i>
<i>that</i> Grand Central...


583
00:38:44.366 --> 00:38:48.530
<i>...is one of the few television shows</i>
<i>where the writer is really the star.</i>


584
00:38:48.703 --> 00:38:51.638
<i>Yeah, but you know,</i>
<i>there's a lot of other people too.</i>


585
00:38:51.807 --> 00:38:54.640
<i>-I mean wonderful people.</i>
<i>-I certainly understand...</i>


586
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.802
<i>...the importance of actors</i>
<i>and then, of course, directors.</i>


587
00:38:57.979 --> 00:38:59.503
<i>Did you write in high school?</i>

588
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:02.707
<i>Did I write in high school?</i>
<i>Yeah, you had to.</i>


589
00:39:04.953 --> 00:39:07.444
<i>-It was Brooklyn.</i>
<i>-It was formally Brooklyn.</i>


590
00:39:07.622 --> 00:39:08.884
Oh, Hecky!

591
00:39:10.025 --> 00:39:14.291
<i>-You know, went around and I--</i>
<i>-But the television form is so different.</i>


592
00:39:14.463 --> 00:39:16.590
<i>-It's--</i>
<i>-Oh, you know it.</i>


593
00:39:16.765 --> 00:39:21.793
<i>-Yeah. And you're so terrific at it.</i>
<i>-Well, you know, I didn't say it.</i>


594
00:39:23.371 --> 00:39:27.171
I wrote what you asked. I was duped.
I didn't know what I was doing.


595
00:39:27.342 --> 00:39:29.640
I'll never do it again.
What more can I say?


596
00:39:29.811 --> 00:39:31.779
-That's up to you.
-I have to work.


597
00:39:31.947 --> 00:39:36.043
I can't get work, Mr. Hennessy.
The doors are closed in my face.


598
00:39:36.218 --> 00:39:40.587
My own agent, 30 years, he won't
even answer my telephone calls.


599
00:39:40.755 --> 00:39:42.689
I appreciate your situation.

600
00:39:42.858 --> 00:39:46.385
I do, Mr. Brown.
I've helped people in your situation.


601
00:39:47.062 --> 00:39:49.860
Then help me, please.

602
00:39:50.031 --> 00:39:53.000
Tell me. I'll turn myself inside out.

603
00:39:53.168 --> 00:39:56.695
-I'll do anything you tell me.
-You make that difficult to believe.


604
00:39:56.872 --> 00:39:58.237
What else can I do?

605
00:39:58.406 --> 00:40:01.534
I'll do it, believe me. You don't know
what I'm going through.


606
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:05.111
I'd like to believe you, but I feel
you're not being entirely frank.


607
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.941
Give me a "for instance."

608
00:40:07.115 --> 00:40:09.015
You'll see. I promise.

609
00:40:09.317 --> 00:40:11.285
You marched in a May Day Parade.

610
00:40:11.586 --> 00:40:13.747
Only because of that girl
with the big ass.


611
00:40:13.922 --> 00:40:16.254
Whose name you say
you can't remember.


612
00:40:16.424 --> 00:40:18.756
What was her name?
Tessie? Bessie?


613
00:40:18.927 --> 00:40:22.294
I wasn't interested in her name.
I was interested in her body.


614
00:40:22.464 --> 00:40:24.364
Other people
marched in that parade...


615
00:40:24.533 --> 00:40:26.398
...other actors, directors.

616
00:40:26.568 --> 00:40:28.695
You don't remember
their names either?


617
00:40:29.304 --> 00:40:32.273
-I'm terrible with names.
-They remember you.


618
00:40:32.507 --> 00:40:34.975
I'm a well-known personality.

619
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:37.811
You talked with these people?

620
00:40:37.979 --> 00:40:40.413
Some of them were kind enough
to write letters.


621
00:40:40.582 --> 00:40:44.541
Then you know who they are.
So it's not so important I remember.


622
00:40:44.719 --> 00:40:47.882
-You know already.
-Your sincerity is important.


623
00:40:48.056 --> 00:40:52.652
-Your desire to cooperate fully.
-I told you what I did!


624
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.262
I apologized!

625
00:40:57.799 --> 00:41:01.428
I come to you on my hands and knees,
Mr. Hennessy. Please.


626
00:41:01.603 --> 00:41:05.835
All I wanna do is work.
That's all I care about. I have a wife.


627
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:08.202
Two growing boys.

628
00:41:08.376 --> 00:41:10.970
Children. Look.

629
00:41:11.613 --> 00:41:14.138
Here. Here.

630
00:41:14.849 --> 00:41:17.784
Plus a wife from before.
If the alimony doesn't come....


631
00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:22.856
I sold my car last week for peanuts!
A brand-new model!


632
00:41:23.024 --> 00:41:27.256
All the money I made, I ask myself,
where did it go so fast?


633
00:41:27.562 --> 00:41:30.531
I can't pay the rent, Mr. Hennessy.

634
00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:33.930
Nothing can go out
if it doesn't come in.


635
00:41:35.203 --> 00:41:37.000
Do you know Howard Prince?

636
00:41:37.372 --> 00:41:38.930
I was on the show.

637
00:41:39.107 --> 00:41:40.768
A big talent. Big.

638
00:41:41.209 --> 00:41:42.699
Do you know him personally?

639
00:41:43.545 --> 00:41:44.842
Only from the show.

640
00:41:45.146 --> 00:41:47.706
Once in a while,
a bite to eat afterwards.


641
00:41:47.882 --> 00:41:49.975
Think you could get
to know him better?


642
00:41:50.986 --> 00:41:54.149
I'm not good at that sort of thing.
Honestly.


643
00:41:54.322 --> 00:41:58.986
Actors, inside,
you'd be surprised, are very shy.


644
00:41:59.327 --> 00:42:02.728
He knows you already.
You're very likable.


645
00:42:02.897 --> 00:42:06.333
-I'm sure he feels sympathy for you.
-What could I find out?


646
00:42:06.568 --> 00:42:09.867
Who his friends are.
What he does in his spare time.


647
00:42:10.105 --> 00:42:13.199
Where he stands on the issues
of the day.


648
00:42:13.842 --> 00:42:15.901
Can't you ask him that yourself?

649
00:42:16.211 --> 00:42:19.840
If he were part of the communist
conspiracy, could we believe him?


650
00:42:24.786 --> 00:42:26.515
If he isn't?

651
00:42:27.622 --> 00:42:30.284
We'd like you to help us find out.

652
00:42:31.059 --> 00:42:34.426
You want me to spy
on Howard Prince?


653
00:42:35.563 --> 00:42:37.622
We're in a war, Mr. Brown.

654
00:42:37.799 --> 00:42:40.768
Against a ruthless and tricky enemy
who will stop at nothing...


655
00:42:40.935 --> 00:42:42.766
...to destroy our way of life.

656
00:42:43.338 --> 00:42:46.933
To be a spy on the side
of freedom is an honor.


657
00:42:48.777 --> 00:42:52.440
And if I spy on Howard Prince,
I can work?


658
00:42:53.081 --> 00:42:55.174
I don't do the hiring, Mr. Brown.

659
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.580
I only advise about Americanism.

660
00:42:57.752 --> 00:43:00.846
But in my opinion,
as the sign of a true patriot...


661
00:43:01.022 --> 00:43:02.546
...it would certainly help.

662
00:43:31.052 --> 00:43:32.314
I quit.

663
00:43:32.487 --> 00:43:36.082
Quit. Quit. Finished. Resigned. Quit.

664
00:43:36.257 --> 00:43:39.021
Let Sussman do his own dirty work.
I won't be part of it.


665
00:43:39.194 --> 00:43:41.458
No more. Not any more. Finished.

666
00:43:41.629 --> 00:43:45.998
Watching people destroyed. Crucified
like Hecky. I'm going to fight it.


667
00:43:47.102 --> 00:43:49.593
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?


668
00:43:49.871 --> 00:43:52.601
-Howard, this is beautiful.
-You quit your job?


669
00:43:52.774 --> 00:43:54.639
I feel so relieved, you have no idea.

670
00:43:54.809 --> 00:43:57.778
I've been a hypocrite to take
their money and keep my mouth shut.


671
00:43:57.946 --> 00:44:00.039
I still don't understand.
You quit your job?


672
00:44:00.215 --> 00:44:01.807
They count on our silence.

673
00:44:01.983 --> 00:44:04.611
People keeping quiet,
afraid to speak up.


674
00:44:05.186 --> 00:44:07.984
Do you know what I'm gonna do?
Publish a newspaper.


675
00:44:08.156 --> 00:44:11.819
Well, anyway, a pamphlet: <i>Facts</i>
<i>About Blacklists.</i> Do you like the title?


676
00:44:11.993 --> 00:44:14.689
I was on the phone all morning.
People are dying to talk...


677
00:44:14.863 --> 00:44:18.731
...as long as I don't use their names.
Oh, Howard, we'll shake them up.


678
00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.391
I'll do the legwork
and you'll do the writing.


679
00:44:21.569 --> 00:44:25.733
Hey, not so fast. Jesus. Florence,
you're making a big mistake.


680
00:44:25.907 --> 00:44:29.968
I believe in personal responsibility,
Howard. If you believe, act.


681
00:44:30.145 --> 00:44:32.943
But I don't understand.
You're throwing away a whole career.


682
00:44:33.114 --> 00:44:34.445
You--
You could--


683
00:44:34.616 --> 00:44:37.813
You're a terrific script editor.
You could be a producer.


684
00:44:37.986 --> 00:44:40.648
You'd be the first woman producer
of a dramatic series.


685
00:44:40.822 --> 00:44:42.619
If I keep my mouth shut.

686
00:44:42.791 --> 00:44:45.760
So? That's not such
a terrible idea sometimes.


687
00:44:45.927 --> 00:44:49.294
-But that's what they're counting on.
-Do me a favor. Please, sit down.


688
00:44:49.464 --> 00:44:51.591
Relax.
You're going off the deep end.


689
00:44:51.766 --> 00:44:54.428
Jesus, let me give you
some champagne.


690
00:44:55.203 --> 00:44:56.830
I'm serious, Howard.

691
00:44:57.272 --> 00:45:00.036
What do you mean you're serious?
You come bursting in here.


692
00:45:00.208 --> 00:45:02.540
You're ready to start a revolution.

693
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:06.077
For God's sakes, Florence,
what are you trying to do?


694
00:45:06.247 --> 00:45:09.705
I want us to fight them.
Not get bought off.


695
00:45:09.884 --> 00:45:11.818
I'm not mad at anybody.

696
00:45:11.986 --> 00:45:13.715
We live in the world, Howard.

697
00:45:13.888 --> 00:45:16.721
No, you live in the world,
I live right here.


698
00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:19.018
Hey, come on,
what are you trying to do to me?


699
00:45:19.194 --> 00:45:21.424
You know how long
it took me to get here?


700
00:45:21.596 --> 00:45:24.190
I like it here. 
I like what I'm doing.

701
00:45:24.365 --> 00:45:26.697
For the first time,
I got everything I want.


702
00:45:26.868 --> 00:45:30.702
-I'm not trying to take it away from you.
-No, but that's what's going to happen.


703
00:45:30.872 --> 00:45:34.774
Howard, I'm only talking
about a simple commitment.


704
00:45:34.943 --> 00:45:37.138
I didn't ask you to marry me.

705
00:45:37.312 --> 00:45:41.214
Jesus, you know, we got
such a terrific relationship going.


706
00:45:41.382 --> 00:45:45.079
-So, why do you wanna spoil it?
-Relationship isn't only sex, you know.


707
00:45:45.253 --> 00:45:48.654
-There are more important aspects.
-I know there are.


708
00:45:48.823 --> 00:45:50.381
Like what?

709
00:45:50.558 --> 00:45:52.287
Human rights.

710
00:45:53.127 --> 00:45:55.095
What about my rights? I'm human.

711
00:45:55.263 --> 00:45:57.527
What happened to my rights
all of a sudden?


712
00:45:57.699 --> 00:45:59.724
I live here, it's clean.

713
00:45:59.901 --> 00:46:03.268
Come on, what are you
putting me on the spot for?


714
00:46:03.805 --> 00:46:06.638
You really want success, don't you?

715
00:46:06.808 --> 00:46:10.335
So, what should I want, a disease?
Yes, I want success.


716
00:46:10.511 --> 00:46:12.775
-What's wrong with that?
-More than anything else?


717
00:46:12.947 --> 00:46:15.438
Florence, you're looking
to get me killed here.


718
00:46:15.617 --> 00:46:18.415
I'm a writer. I'm not looking
for any kind of trouble.


719
00:46:18.586 --> 00:46:21.578
-I don't wanna make waves.
-A writer looks for trouble.


720
00:46:21.756 --> 00:46:24.725
No. Wrong.
A lunatic looks for trouble.


721
00:46:24.893 --> 00:46:27.384
Florence, you're crazy.
You're out of your mind.


722
00:46:27.562 --> 00:46:30.395
You already said that.
There's no need in repeating yourself.


723
00:46:30.565 --> 00:46:32.624
I want you to go in
to Sussman tomorrow...


724
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.792
...and tell him
that you made a mistake.


725
00:46:36.237 --> 00:46:39.138
-I should tell him?
-Exactly. Go in and tell him...


726
00:46:39.307 --> 00:46:42.333
-...you're sorry and you should get--
-But I'm not sorry.


727
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:46.446
Florence, I don't think you know
exactly what's good for you.


728
00:46:46.614 --> 00:46:49.310
But I do know
when I've made a mistake.


729
00:46:49.817 --> 00:46:52.115
And I made this
kind of a mistake before...


730
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.216
...confusing the artist with the man.

731
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:58.623
I just want you to know
I still admire the artist.


732
00:46:59.093 --> 00:47:01.425
-You're going?
-Yes.


733
00:47:06.534 --> 00:47:09.799
I have a club date in the mountains.
I thought you could drive me up.


734
00:47:09.971 --> 00:47:12.371
Sure. You couldn't have called me
at a better time.


735
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.270
When you work as hard as I do,
you need time to relax.


736
00:47:15.443 --> 00:47:18.435
Otherwise it's all work and no play.

737
00:47:18.913 --> 00:47:21.438
I guess you have a lot of friends.

738
00:47:21.616 --> 00:47:24.449
The usual. I like to pick up
a phone, get out, have fun.


739
00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:28.020
But the important thing is that you've
got to get right back to basics.


740
00:47:28.189 --> 00:47:30.680
What do you like to do
in your spare time?


741
00:47:30.858 --> 00:47:32.120
The usual.

742
00:47:32.293 --> 00:47:34.056
The usual.

743
00:47:34.662 --> 00:47:39.395
I used to love the usual,
but my ship has sailed.


744
00:47:39.567 --> 00:47:42.627
Watch your step around here.
The broads, take a look at them...


745
00:47:42.804 --> 00:47:45.568
...and you say to yourself,
"Where's this been all my life?"


746
00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:49.642
They come at you from all directions.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.


747
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:53.212
-Later on you find out you're the fish.
-Yeah, well, don't worry about me.


748
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:54.712
Don't make any promises.

749
00:47:54.882 --> 00:47:57.112
These broads
come up here with their lawyers.


750
00:47:57.285 --> 00:48:00.777
-Yeah? You play these places much?
-Until I got in TV.


751
00:48:00.955 --> 00:48:02.980
You know what I used
to get for one night?


752
00:48:03.157 --> 00:48:04.647
-What?
-Three grand.


753
00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:06.724
That should come in handy now.

754
00:48:06.894 --> 00:48:08.794
-You know what I'm getting tonight?
-What?


755
00:48:08.963 --> 00:48:10.453
Five hundred.

756
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:13.191
Five--
That doesn't seem fair.


757
00:48:13.368 --> 00:48:16.030
And where is it written
it should be fair?


758
00:48:16.204 --> 00:48:20.004
Come on, Howie, you must have
some friends in the same position.


759
00:48:24.245 --> 00:48:27.078
Hecky! It's a pleasure.

760
00:48:27.248 --> 00:48:29.682
How long? A year, two years?

761
00:48:29.851 --> 00:48:32.319
-It's a pleasure having you back.
-Likewise.


762
00:48:32.487 --> 00:48:35.547
This is my friend, Howard
Prince, the great and famous writer.


763
00:48:35.723 --> 00:48:37.714
Pleasure, Howard.
Any friend of Hecky's.


764
00:48:37.892 --> 00:48:39.985
Come on, we'll go inside,
have a drink.


765
00:48:40.161 --> 00:48:42.891
-I never drink before a show.
-We'll have a talk.


766
00:48:43.064 --> 00:48:45.123
How's everything?

767
00:48:49.303 --> 00:48:51.794
Oh, it's Hecky Brown!

768
00:49:06.487 --> 00:49:09.320
Would you please park my car for me?
Thank you.


769
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:13.187
-You staying long?
-Just the weekend.


770
00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:16.387
-You too?
-Yeah.


771
00:49:17.198 --> 00:49:19.166
What do you do?

772
00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:21.767
I'm a writer.

773
00:49:21.936 --> 00:49:23.631
A writer.

774
00:49:26.841 --> 00:49:29.810
-You'll have a drink, Howard?
-Sure.


775
00:49:33.381 --> 00:49:35.144
Here we go.

776
00:49:36.017 --> 00:49:38.076
To a giant
of the entertainment world.


777
00:49:38.252 --> 00:49:40.220
Business looks good, Sam.

778
00:49:40.388 --> 00:49:42.083
-Full up.
-Loss leaders.


779
00:49:42.256 --> 00:49:44.781
We give discounts
so the rooms won't stay empty.


780
00:49:44.959 --> 00:49:48.395
To tell you the truth, we're not
even holding our own. The upkeep.


781
00:49:48.563 --> 00:49:50.724
Which comes to what I want
to mention.


782
00:49:50.898 --> 00:49:54.197
The 500. I already accepted, Sam.

783
00:49:54.368 --> 00:49:57.826
-I don't need your song and dance.
-Two-fifty.


784
00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.337
You promised five.

785
00:50:01.509 --> 00:50:03.306
I was hoping five.

786
00:50:03.578 --> 00:50:07.207
I figured I'd steal a little from the band,
from the dance team.


787
00:50:07.381 --> 00:50:11.579
Make it up that way. But you know
the unions, they could shut me down.


788
00:50:11.752 --> 00:50:15.210
-You knew this when you said five.
-I was still hoping.


789
00:50:15.389 --> 00:50:17.823
Last year I played this joint
for how much?


790
00:50:17.992 --> 00:50:20.790
All right, today is not like last year.

791
00:50:20.962 --> 00:50:23.192
But I'm still Hecky Brown.

792
00:50:23.364 --> 00:50:25.059
Don't you forget that.

793
00:50:25.233 --> 00:50:30.193
-You can't get Hecky Brown for 250.
-Maybe 300.


794
00:50:30.571 --> 00:50:32.505
Out of my own pocket.

795
00:50:32.673 --> 00:50:35.233
I piss on your 300!

796
00:50:35.409 --> 00:50:37.900
Who else is offering that much?

797
00:50:38.613 --> 00:50:41.377
Don't be foolish. Face facts.

798
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:43.642
There's a cloud over your head.

799
00:50:43.818 --> 00:50:46.252
If it was up to me personally,
I'd pay you the moon.


800
00:50:46.721 --> 00:50:48.814
But business is business.

801
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:50.685
You drove all the way up here.

802
00:50:51.025 --> 00:50:53.050
You wanna go home empty?

803
00:50:53.227 --> 00:50:55.491
Take the 250.

804
00:50:57.999 --> 00:50:59.523
You said 300.

805
00:51:00.168 --> 00:51:02.295
I'll see what I can do.

806
00:51:46.414 --> 00:51:49.281
You were great.
You were really great.


807
00:52:19.647 --> 00:52:23.515
Let's stop this pretense. Room 904.

808
00:52:25.019 --> 00:52:27.351
lsn't he fantastic?

809
00:52:27.755 --> 00:52:30.918
I could watch him every night.
He's so hilarious.


810
00:52:31.859 --> 00:52:33.451
You a guest here?

811
00:52:38.766 --> 00:52:40.734
What do you do?

812
00:52:40.935 --> 00:52:42.994
I'm a dentist.

813
00:52:44.572 --> 00:52:46.039
Professionally?

814
00:52:50.945 --> 00:52:52.503
I'm Sandy.

815
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.614
Herman. Herman Miller.

816
00:52:54.782 --> 00:52:57.114
-You have your own practice?
-Yes, I do.


817
00:52:57.285 --> 00:53:00.812
But I gotta get another guy in with me,
because it's getting too big.


818
00:53:01.088 --> 00:53:04.023
Are you by any chance attached?

819
00:53:04.625 --> 00:53:06.650
Only to my work.

820
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:12.592
Hecky, Hecky, what can I say.
I'm speechless. Words fail me.


821
00:53:12.767 --> 00:53:15.292
One of the great performances.
You can tell your children...


822
00:53:15.469 --> 00:53:20.497
...your grandchildren you saw one
of the all-time greats, without peer.


823
00:53:21.909 --> 00:53:23.604
-Beautiful!
-Two-fifty.


824
00:53:23.778 --> 00:53:25.075
I did what I could.

825
00:53:25.246 --> 00:53:27.806
But you said 300.

826
00:53:27.982 --> 00:53:30.143
-Maybe next month.
-Out of your own pocket.


827
00:53:30.318 --> 00:53:31.876
By popular demand.

828
00:53:32.053 --> 00:53:33.918
What comes out of your pocket?
Tell me.


829
00:53:34.088 --> 00:53:35.953
Hecky, will you stop?

830
00:53:36.123 --> 00:53:39.092
-Tell me what's inside here.
-Hecky, don't tickle me.


831
00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.787
-Hecky, will you stop being so--?
-Appreciation?


832
00:53:42.963 --> 00:53:44.225
-Sympathy?
-Hecky--


833
00:53:44.398 --> 00:53:46.662
What comes out of your pockets?

834
00:53:46.834 --> 00:53:50.292
You know what comes out
of your pockets? Blood!


835
00:53:50.471 --> 00:53:52.132
Blood comes out of your pocket!

836
00:53:52.306 --> 00:53:53.739
-Get him out of here!
-Blood!


837
00:53:53.908 --> 00:53:56.138
-Get this crazy--
-I want to kill you.


838
00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:58.335
You son of a--

839
00:54:01.282 --> 00:54:05.116
Get him out!
Get him out of here! Out! Out!


840
00:54:05.286 --> 00:54:07.379
Get him out! Get him out!

841
00:54:08.522 --> 00:54:12.014
Get him out of here! You fat pig!
You'll never work again!


842
00:54:12.193 --> 00:54:15.458
I'm Hecky Brown! 
I'm Hecky Brown!

843
00:54:15.896 --> 00:54:21.198
You'll crawl in the gutter, you red
bastard! You commie son of a bitch!


844
00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:27.774
Come on. Give me that.

845
00:54:28.909 --> 00:54:31.537
Hey, here's what I want you to do.

846
00:54:31.712 --> 00:54:34.306
I want you to sleep
on the sofa tonight...


847
00:54:34.482 --> 00:54:37.349
...because you'll find
it's extremely comfortable.


848
00:54:37.518 --> 00:54:41.921
It's brand-new. You're gonna like this.
See? Just stay here.


849
00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:44.182
Window.

850
00:54:47.294 --> 00:54:50.229
Let me make you
some coffee, okay?


851
00:54:51.565 --> 00:54:53.760
It's all Brownstein's fault.

852
00:54:53.934 --> 00:54:57.062
I wouldn't be in this trouble
if it wasn't for Brownstein.


853
00:54:57.238 --> 00:54:59.433
-Yeah, who?
-Brownstein.


854
00:54:59.607 --> 00:55:01.768
Hershel Brownstein?

855
00:55:02.243 --> 00:55:06.577
-Who's Hershel Brownstein?
-You can't make a deal with him.


856
00:55:07.114 --> 00:55:08.672
That's the trouble.

857
00:55:08.849 --> 00:55:10.817
He won't listen to reason.

858
00:55:13.354 --> 00:55:16.517
Is that your real name?
Hershel Brownstein?


859
00:55:17.024 --> 00:55:20.824
Brownstein! Lay off, you hear me?

860
00:55:21.195 --> 00:55:24.187
Lay off or I'll kill you!

861
00:55:24.832 --> 00:55:29.462
Jesus, you know, people
change their names. It's no crime.


862
00:55:30.471 --> 00:55:31.802
What do you know?

863
00:55:31.972 --> 00:55:34.065
Who the hell are you? A newcomer.

864
00:55:34.241 --> 00:55:36.402
-Why don't you sit down?
-Why don't you shut up?


865
00:55:36.577 --> 00:55:39.273
You think you're so special?
Talent is no protection.


866
00:55:39.447 --> 00:55:42.245
-You do as they say or else.
-I'm gonna make you some coffee.


867
00:55:42.416 --> 00:55:44.281
This is a very nice apartment.
Very nice.


868
00:55:44.452 --> 00:55:46.943
-Thank you.
-You have nice things.


869
00:55:47.121 --> 00:55:49.715
Bookcases, hi-fi...

870
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:51.551
...and nice furniture.

871
00:55:51.725 --> 00:55:53.784
You like this apartment, I bet.

872
00:55:53.961 --> 00:55:56.156
You worked hard for it.
You deserve it.


873
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.525
You'd like to keep this apartment,
right?


874
00:55:58.699 --> 00:56:00.894
You know what we should do?
Call your wife.


875
00:56:01.068 --> 00:56:04.162
Because you should tell her
at least where you are tonight.


876
00:56:04.338 --> 00:56:06.101
Where'd you go last week?

877
00:56:06.273 --> 00:56:08.002
-Nowhere.
-Nowhere is somewhere.


878
00:56:08.175 --> 00:56:10.575
From the heart,
no credit unless it's from the heart.


879
00:56:10.744 --> 00:56:12.769
Here and there.
Around and about.


880
00:56:12.947 --> 00:56:15.609
-What do you want me to say?
-Where'd you go last year?


881
00:56:15.783 --> 00:56:18.115
Year before, who'd you see?
Where did you march?


882
00:56:18.285 --> 00:56:20.048
-What did you sign?
-Nothing.


883
00:56:20.254 --> 00:56:22.484
That girl you're with.
What's her name?


884
00:56:22.656 --> 00:56:24.248
-Florence.
-A troublemaker.


885
00:56:24.425 --> 00:56:27.292
I heard her talking on the set.
Subversive. She's a red.


886
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:29.190
-You like that girl?
-Yes, I like her.


887
00:56:29.363 --> 00:56:30.625
-Her name?
-I told you.


888
00:56:30.798 --> 00:56:32.629
-Her full name.
-Florence Barrett.


889
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.634
-You know she's a red?
-Stop it, Hecky! I don't like this game.


890
00:58:06.794 --> 00:58:10.286
Actually, I think you could say
that modern American fiction...


891
00:58:10.464 --> 00:58:13.797
-...began with <i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>
-But what about Melville?


892
00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:16.095
Especially today, the sense of evil.

893
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.330
Oh, yeah.
How could you leave out Melville?


894
00:58:19.506 --> 00:58:23.636
You must be so excited. The show
going from a half-hour to an hour.


895
00:58:23.811 --> 00:58:26.473
I was expecting it
with those ratings.


896
00:58:26.647 --> 00:58:28.376
They're no fools up there.

897
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:30.813
Can you get the same quality
in an hour?


898
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:32.953
It is a problem,
no doubt about it.


899
00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.714
It's like going from
a short story to a novel.


900
00:58:35.889 --> 00:58:37.379
But one thing I've learned:

901
00:58:37.558 --> 00:58:39.992
You got the talent,
you got the quality.


902
00:58:43.597 --> 00:58:45.360
Phil. Howard.

903
00:58:46.433 --> 00:58:48.492
I want you to meet Hubert Jackson.

904
00:58:48.669 --> 00:58:50.864
Jackson Supermarkets,
out on the island.


905
00:58:51.038 --> 00:58:53.336
-Congratulations, gentlemen.
-Thank you.


906
00:58:53.507 --> 00:58:57.204
-Hubert's a great fan of your show.
-Never miss it.


907
00:58:57.378 --> 00:59:00.313
But he's a little concerned
about some of the actors.


908
00:59:00.481 --> 00:59:02.278
We go for the best, Mr. Jackson.

909
00:59:02.449 --> 00:59:05.850
In my opinion, some of them
are pretty pink, Mr. Sussman.


910
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.851
That's just the makeup.

911
00:59:08.022 --> 00:59:10.855
I told Hubert we are
as concerned as he is.


912
00:59:11.025 --> 00:59:12.890
Not that they are, the actors.

913
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.255
We take every precaution.

914
00:59:15.429 --> 00:59:17.829
-The slightest hint.
-I know my customers.


915
00:59:17.998 --> 00:59:21.764
If they think a company is sponsoring
reds, they don't buy their product.


916
00:59:22.603 --> 00:59:24.503
-How do they know?
-I tell them.


917
00:59:24.672 --> 00:59:26.731
Put a sign right up over the product.

918
00:59:26.907 --> 00:59:31.071
Yes, I thought you might send Hubert
a list of the actors you plan to use.


919
00:59:31.245 --> 00:59:33.611
Let him look them over,
give you any ideas.


920
00:59:33.781 --> 00:59:34.770
Absolutely.

921
00:59:34.948 --> 00:59:37.678
You'll get full cooperation
from us, Hubert.


922
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:41.116
Nothing to worry about.
Thanks, boys.


923
00:59:42.623 --> 00:59:44.488
How many stores that guy got?

924
00:59:44.658 --> 00:59:46.421
Three, maybe four.

925
00:59:46.593 --> 00:59:50.427
He's got three stores,
he tells a whole network who to hire?


926
00:59:50.597 --> 00:59:52.758
Who wants trouble?

927
00:59:55.269 --> 00:59:57.601
Nice to see you again, Mr. Prince.

928
01:00:15.522 --> 01:00:17.387
-Here's your check, Herb.
-Thanks.


929
01:00:17.558 --> 01:00:18.684
Here you go, Bill.

930
01:00:18.859 --> 01:00:21.123
-And yours didn't come yet, Allie.
-What?


931
01:00:21.295 --> 01:00:24.628
You were late with the script.
You gotta watch that.


932
01:00:24.798 --> 01:00:27.358
Oh, by the way,
here's your script back.


933
01:00:27.534 --> 01:00:29.502
It needs rewrite, I'm afraid.

934
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.798
-What didn't Sussman like?
-I didn't show it to him.


935
01:00:33.207 --> 01:00:35.300
What do you mean
you didn't show it?


936
01:00:35.476 --> 01:00:36.636
It wasn't ready.

937
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:39.608
Come on, Allie,
I can't hand in anything.


938
01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:42.613
My name's going on that script.
I got a reputation.


939
01:00:44.418 --> 01:00:47.046
I'll try to write up
to your standards, Howard.


940
01:00:47.221 --> 01:00:50.987
It's possible going to an hour
is too much pressure for you guys.


941
01:00:51.158 --> 01:00:55.424
Because I've been noticing
the stuff lately and it's thin, fellas.


942
01:00:55.596 --> 01:00:58.622
The keyword, I think, is "substance."

943
01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:01.461
I've been reading
the Eugene O'Neill plays...


944
01:01:01.635 --> 01:01:05.093
...and I would like, if possible,
something along those lines.


945
01:01:05.272 --> 01:01:08.730
-More laughs.
-Exactly. You know, but gutsy.


946
01:01:08.909 --> 01:01:12.345
Incidentally, I think I made a deal
for a new series.


947
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.775
We've got our hands full here.

948
01:01:15.415 --> 01:01:19.283
So you put on a couple of
more writers. I need a pilot script.


949
01:01:19.453 --> 01:01:21.978
How about Eugene O'Neill?

950
01:01:22.156 --> 01:01:25.148
-He's dead, Herb.
-What's the subject?


951
01:01:25.325 --> 01:01:28.522
It's a woman reporter,
which, I think, is a great idea.


952
01:01:28.695 --> 01:01:30.287
I got the perfect actress.

953
01:01:30.464 --> 01:01:33.524
-Her and a Howard Prince script.
-We'll look around.


954
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.431
Right. But good, Bill,
because blacklisted is not enough.


955
01:01:37.604 --> 01:01:39.469
Scrambled eggs, loose.

956
01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.073
White fish.

957
01:01:42.676 --> 01:01:45.144
Let's see, eggplant steak.

958
01:01:45.312 --> 01:01:47.303
Eat in good health.

959
01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:50.279
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill him. You rat.


960
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.645
Al, take it easy, please.

961
01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.138
Look, this is ridiculous.

962
01:02:21.315 --> 01:02:24.045
I've been calling you now
for three weeks...


963
01:02:24.218 --> 01:02:26.243
...and you don't answer me.
Nothing.


964
01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.945
What's the big deal?
We had a little argument.


965
01:02:29.489 --> 01:02:31.514
We don't think alike, Howard.

966
01:02:31.692 --> 01:02:33.785
We don't believe in the same things.

967
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:37.055
Do you think I like the blacklist?
I hate the blacklist.


968
01:02:39.099 --> 01:02:43.502
-Did I send money for your pamphlet?
-Giving money is easy.


969
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:47.936
Well, what's easy for you is not
always easy for everybody else.


970
01:02:48.108 --> 01:02:51.669
You see trouble and right away
you run and get a gun.


971
01:02:51.845 --> 01:02:53.642
Or a pamphlet or some--

972
01:02:53.814 --> 01:02:56.977
I'm just looking all the time
not to get killed, that's all.


973
01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:01.314
Is that such a big difference?
We have to break up over that?


974
01:03:01.488 --> 01:03:04.048
Yeah, maybe we do.

975
01:03:04.224 --> 01:03:07.352
So you want to stay broken up?

976
01:03:12.132 --> 01:03:15.226
You think I want to make you
lose everything.


977
01:03:15.402 --> 01:03:18.496
You think I'm intolerant
and demanding, and maybe I am.


978
01:03:18.672 --> 01:03:21.004
But that's me.

979
01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:24.742
Well, then, I need more time.

980
01:03:24.912 --> 01:03:28.348
Because I've never met anybody
like you, you know?


981
01:03:28.515 --> 01:03:32.645
I tried to get us tickets to the Paul
Robeson concert, you know...


982
01:03:32.819 --> 01:03:38.553
...but it happened to be on the same
night as the basketball game, so....


983
01:03:40.227 --> 01:03:44.823
-We'll go to the game, right?
-I have tickets for the concert.


984
01:03:47.434 --> 01:03:49.902
All right, so here's what:

985
01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:52.968
I'll give up my tickets,
you give up yours...


986
01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.835
...and we'll go to the dinner.

987
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:57.334
Right?

988
01:04:01.715 --> 01:04:05.048
-Florence, I miss you.
-I miss you too.


989
01:04:06.086 --> 01:04:08.680
So we'll have a date.

990
01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:16.721
A subpoena?

991
01:04:16.897 --> 01:04:18.387
For me?

992
01:04:18.565 --> 01:04:21.659
To appear before
the House Un-American Committee.


993
01:04:21.835 --> 01:04:24.599
Well, what do you mean? When?
How do you know?


994
01:04:24.771 --> 01:04:28.502
They found out upstairs.
It will be issued any minute now.


995
01:04:28.675 --> 01:04:32.406
-But I'm not a communist.
-So you go and tell them that.


996
01:04:33.513 --> 01:04:36.505
-I tell you, isn't that enough?
-You've got to go.


997
01:04:36.683 --> 01:04:41.017
I don't like it anymore than you do,
but if you don't do it, you don't work.


998
01:04:42.122 --> 01:04:46.752
Why don't they all just go away
and let us do the show?


999
01:04:46.927 --> 01:04:48.326
Who needs this?

1000
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.128
You know, Phil...

1001
01:04:52.332 --> 01:04:55.768
...I didn't believe Florence
when she told me that about you.


1002
01:04:57.604 --> 01:04:58.866
That crazy broad.

1003
01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:03.601
You know, because I know it was
very tough for you to fire Hecky.


1004
01:05:05.512 --> 01:05:07.377
I had a migraine for a week.

1005
01:05:08.148 --> 01:05:11.413
Phil, it just takes one guy
to say no to them. Just one.


1006
01:05:11.585 --> 01:05:14.918
-What can I do, Howie?
-You can be that guy.


1007
01:05:16.423 --> 01:05:19.915
No, I'm serious.
If just one person says no...


1008
01:05:20.093 --> 01:05:23.654
...especially a guy like you. You're
respected. You got a big name.


1009
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:26.230
Tell them no.
Who the hell are they?


1010
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.096
Come on, Phil, take a stand.

1011
01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:31.965
The real you.

1012
01:05:38.779 --> 01:05:40.940
Get me Hampton.

1013
01:05:42.649 --> 01:05:46.585
Hello, Tom? There is no reason
Howard has to go to that committee.


1014
01:05:46.753 --> 01:05:47.981
It's our network.

1015
01:05:48.155 --> 01:05:50.589
Who the hell are they
telling us what to do?


1016
01:05:50.757 --> 01:05:53.783
No, you listen to me.
He doesn't have to go.


1017
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.951
What are we, sheep?
We make a stand.


1018
01:05:56.129 --> 01:05:59.326
We tell them to lay off his back,
to stop threatening...


1019
01:05:59.499 --> 01:06:00.989
...or they're in trouble.

1020
01:06:01.168 --> 01:06:04.035
We show them there are
some people they can't scare.


1021
01:06:04.204 --> 01:06:07.105
We tell them flat out,
"Howard Prince doesn't go."


1022
01:06:07.274 --> 01:06:08.502
Right.

1023
01:06:10.577 --> 01:06:12.238
Right.

1024
01:06:12.946 --> 01:06:14.743
Okay.

1025
01:06:15.949 --> 01:06:17.317
You gotta go.

1026
01:06:17.317 --> 01:06:18.011
You gotta go.

1027
01:06:18.552 --> 01:06:20.645
<i>You've got nothing to worry about.</i>

1028
01:06:20.821 --> 01:06:23.255
Nothing to worry about at all.

1029
01:06:23.423 --> 01:06:26.256
We've dealt with
the committee before...


1030
01:06:26.426 --> 01:06:29.589
...and they're really
very understanding.


1031
01:06:29.763 --> 01:06:34.166
They understand our problems
and we understand theirs.


1032
01:06:34.334 --> 01:06:35.926
And what about my problems?

1033
01:06:36.103 --> 01:06:38.970
You're cooperating.
That's all they care about.


1034
01:06:39.139 --> 01:06:44.975
-This friend of yours, Alfred Miller.
-We went to school together.


1035
01:06:45.145 --> 01:06:48.114
And you had no idea
that he was a communist?


1036
01:06:48.281 --> 01:06:51.079
-He was only 12.
-You have no idea now?


1037
01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:53.549
-We never talk about politics.
-Good.


1038
01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.019
Let's see, now. The two men,
Delaney and Phelps?


1039
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.556
-They're friends of Allie's.
-All right.


1040
01:06:59.726 --> 01:07:03.321
-And the girl, Florence Barrett?
-That's just sex.


1041
01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:08.161
Is that why you gave money
to her pro-communist publication?


1042
01:07:08.335 --> 01:07:10.963
We were going out.
She wanted to start a magazine.


1043
01:07:11.138 --> 01:07:12.833
How was I to know what kind?

1044
01:07:13.707 --> 01:07:17.006
-That's hardly credible, Mr. Prince.
-Mr. Hennessy...


1045
01:07:17.177 --> 01:07:19.805
...you and your staff
have done a splendid job.


1046
01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.540
The network appreciates your efforts...

1047
01:07:22.716 --> 01:07:25.344
...but Mr. Prince is being
entirely cooperative.


1048
01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:29.717
I think that I can handle the legal end.
Thank you very much for coming.


1049
01:07:38.131 --> 01:07:40.429
Good luck, Mr. Prince.

1050
01:07:43.403 --> 01:07:46.531
Howard, don't mind him.

1051
01:07:46.706 --> 01:07:50.506
-He's only doing his job.
-I still don't see why we can't fix it.


1052
01:07:50.677 --> 01:07:54.010
Like pay somebody off,
because how much could it cost?


1053
01:07:54.181 --> 01:07:57.082
-They're just congressmen.
-It won't be necessary.


1054
01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.582
They've agreed
to an executive session.


1055
01:07:59.753 --> 01:08:02.278
No reporters, no publicity.

1056
01:08:02.455 --> 01:08:05.515
As a matter of fact, you won't
even have to go to Washington.


1057
01:08:05.692 --> 01:08:07.387
They'll send a subcommittee here.

1058
01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:12.197
<i>We'll write you a strong</i>
<i>anti-communist statement...</i>


1059
01:08:12.365 --> 01:08:16.768
<i>...to go along with your testimony.</i>
<i>You will be out of there in no time.</i>


1060
01:08:17.971 --> 01:08:21.839
<i>Howard, all they want</i>
<i>is a friendly witness.</i>


1061
01:08:23.009 --> 01:08:24.340
<i>Okay.</i>

1062
01:08:24.511 --> 01:08:27.071
<i>So I'll be a friendly witness.</i>

1063
01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:27.314
Hi, Howard.

1064
01:08:27.314 --> 01:08:28.906
Hi, Howard.

1065
01:08:31.084 --> 01:08:32.881
Hey, very nice.

1066
01:08:33.053 --> 01:08:34.884
You gotta lay off health foods.

1067
01:08:35.055 --> 01:08:38.752
Jesus, when are they gonna operate,
get rid of that ulcer already?


1068
01:08:38.925 --> 01:08:40.984
Then how am I going
to know when I'm mad?


1069
01:08:41.161 --> 01:08:43.857
Nobody knows how
to relax anymore, right?


1070
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:47.591
-You gotta roll with the punches.
-What about the subpoena?


1071
01:08:47.767 --> 01:08:49.792
Nothing. Don't worry about a thing.

1072
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:52.097
-Did they write a statement for you?
-Yeah.


1073
01:08:52.272 --> 01:08:54.832
I'd let you read it,
only you'd start bleeding again.


1074
01:08:55.642 --> 01:08:58.543
Don't worry about it, really.
Just take care of yourself.


1075
01:08:58.712 --> 01:09:00.612
Worry about
who's gonna write scripts.


1076
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.305
We got a very good writer.
You won't be ashamed.


1077
01:09:03.483 --> 01:09:05.781
-Blacklisted?
-Impeccably.


1078
01:09:05.952 --> 01:09:09.945
-Named by his own brother-in-law.
-Visiting hours are over.


1079
01:09:10.123 --> 01:09:13.650
Nurse, I'm Dr. Prince.
This is a consultation.


1080
01:09:13.827 --> 01:09:15.761
These are my associates.

1081
01:09:21.334 --> 01:09:24.201
Why do you think
they want you to testify?


1082
01:09:24.971 --> 01:09:28.338
I'm a feather in their cap.
I'm a big writer, Howard Prince.


1083
01:09:28.508 --> 01:09:32.877
They've already got our names. Why
do they need you to tell them again?


1084
01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:35.276
So it makes them look good.
So what?


1085
01:09:35.448 --> 01:09:39.350
They don't care about names. It's
about getting people to give names...


1086
01:09:39.519 --> 01:09:42.579
...to show there's nothing
they can't get people to do.


1087
01:09:42.756 --> 01:09:47.819
If I don't cooperate, you don't work,
nobody works. Is that what you want?


1088
01:09:47.994 --> 01:09:50.861
We're laying too much on him.
Why should he take the rap?


1089
01:09:51.031 --> 01:09:53.192
Because I want him to know
what he's doing.


1090
01:09:53.366 --> 01:09:55.197
-I'm helping.
-You're helping them.


1091
01:09:55.368 --> 01:09:59.566
No, I'm using them.
I'm smarter than they are.


1092
01:09:59.739 --> 01:10:02.833
Howard, the time
for this bullshit is over.


1093
01:10:03.009 --> 01:10:05.705
If I'm friendly,
where is the personal crime?


1094
01:10:05.879 --> 01:10:08.109
I tell them you're my friend
from school.


1095
01:10:08.281 --> 01:10:11.409
They already got your name.
You said that yourself.


1096
01:10:11.584 --> 01:10:14.576
He's right.
They can't do anything more to us.


1097
01:10:14.754 --> 01:10:17.245
-Why can't he just cooperate?
-Tell them the truth?


1098
01:10:17.424 --> 01:10:19.483
He won't have to.
The networks made a deal:


1099
01:10:19.659 --> 01:10:21.991
Say the committee's great,
they leave him alone.


1100
01:10:22.162 --> 01:10:25.893
And everybody gets what he wants.
That's what this is about, right?


1101
01:10:26.066 --> 01:10:29.058
Stop worrying.
They want publicity.


1102
01:10:29.235 --> 01:10:30.497
They want Howard Prince...

1103
01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:33.036
...as an example to scare people.
Shut them up.


1104
01:10:33.206 --> 01:10:35.572
-He should take the Fifth.
-They'll blacklist him.


1105
01:10:35.742 --> 01:10:36.731
What's the Fifth?

1106
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:39.777
The Fifth Amendment.
Your right not to incriminate yourself.


1107
01:10:39.946 --> 01:10:41.880
Why do I have to? 
It's all fixed.

1108
01:10:42.048 --> 01:10:44.710
They might ask you questions
you don't want to answer.


1109
01:10:44.884 --> 01:10:48.376
But if you already answered one,
you don't have that right anymore.


1110
01:10:48.555 --> 01:10:51.615
Then if you don't answer,
they cite you for contempt.


1111
01:10:51.791 --> 01:10:53.452
Yeah, but I'm gonna answer.

1112
01:10:54.094 --> 01:10:55.288
Schmuck.

1113
01:10:55.462 --> 01:10:57.692
Maybe he should.
What can he tell them?


1114
01:10:57.864 --> 01:10:59.923
I don't trust the committee
or the network.


1115
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.068
-Take the Fifth.
-I don't want to.


1116
01:11:02.235 --> 01:11:05.227
-You can't cooperate!
-Don't be a loser all your life.


1117
01:11:05.405 --> 01:11:07.202
You quit looking for an out!

1118
01:11:07.374 --> 01:11:13.404
Look, do not aggravate yourself.
You want that milk, now. Here.


1119
01:11:16.649 --> 01:11:20.847
You did a big favor for all of us.
I don't have to tell you that.


1120
01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.011
-Who's asking?
-You saved our ass.


1121
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:25.657
-You did what a friend does.
-Exactly.


1122
01:11:25.825 --> 01:11:29.488
-If I cooperate, you're saved again.
-But you can't be on their side.


1123
01:11:29.662 --> 01:11:32.756
So, what do I do?
I tell the committee to shove it, right?


1124
01:11:32.932 --> 01:11:35.867
-You don't work, nobody works.
-Let me worry about that.


1125
01:11:36.035 --> 01:11:39.835
What about me? What do I do,
go back to the cash register?


1126
01:11:40.006 --> 01:11:41.633
You're laying here...

1127
01:11:41.808 --> 01:11:44.038
...you can't use your name,
you're bleeding...


1128
01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:45.973
...and you're telling me what to do?

1129
01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:49.280
Al, can we ask him to do
what he doesn't believe in?


1130
01:11:49.449 --> 01:11:51.610
Protect yourself.
Take the Fifth.


1131
01:11:52.152 --> 01:11:55.019
You're always looking for a middle
you can dance around in.


1132
01:11:55.188 --> 01:11:57.247
Well, this time there isn't any middle.

1133
01:11:57.424 --> 01:12:01.952
And you can't lay any of it off on us.
Whatever you do, you do for yourself.


1134
01:12:02.395 --> 01:12:05.887
Open up in the name of the law!
Get out your guns, men.


1135
01:12:07.233 --> 01:12:09.531
Nobody move. This is a raid.

1136
01:12:09.702 --> 01:12:11.602
Everybody. Everybody out.

1137
01:12:11.771 --> 01:12:14.137
You have a girl in your room.
If not, why not?


1138
01:12:14.307 --> 01:12:17.003
You got a little tootsie for me?
Have we met before?


1139
01:12:17.177 --> 01:12:19.338
You know you scared me?

1140
01:12:19.512 --> 01:12:23.346
I was in the neighborhood
and suddenly everything went black.


1141
01:12:23.516 --> 01:12:26.144
-Am I disturbing you?
-Are you kidding?


1142
01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:30.688
You really want to know, I came
to apologize for that terrible night.


1143
01:12:30.857 --> 01:12:33.917
-I wasn't myself.
-You had every right.


1144
01:12:34.093 --> 01:12:36.561
Two rights don't make a wrong.

1145
01:12:36.729 --> 01:12:40.631
-I gave you a hard time and I'm sorry.
-Silly. Have a drink.


1146
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.132
Before the sun is over the yardarm?

1147
01:12:43.303 --> 01:12:46.033
Never. A wee touch of scotch.

1148
01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:51.142
-How's it going?
-Not bad.


1149
01:12:51.311 --> 01:12:54.678
Club dates.
Out of town, but not bad.


1150
01:12:54.848 --> 01:12:57.248
Scranton, Allentown, Altoona.

1151
01:12:57.417 --> 01:13:00.113
You didn't know
I was a big hit in Pennsylvania.


1152
01:13:00.286 --> 01:13:04.552
But my wife found a job, the kids eat,
we all have our health.


1153
01:13:05.325 --> 01:13:08.021
To a prince of a prince.

1154
01:13:13.433 --> 01:13:15.958
You know, I never learned
how to sip a drink.


1155
01:13:16.603 --> 01:13:20.369
When I was very little,
every evening before supper...


1156
01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:25.000
...my father would pour a shot glass
full of whiskey, mumble a prayer:


1157
01:13:28.348 --> 01:13:31.283
And down it went.
I thought that was the way you drank.


1158
01:13:33.219 --> 01:13:35.016
How are things going with you?

1159
01:13:36.222 --> 01:13:38.850
-Fine.
-I hear terrific.


1160
01:13:41.361 --> 01:13:44.888
It's nice when nice happens
to somebody nice.


1161
01:13:45.064 --> 01:13:46.656
Doesn't happen too often.

1162
01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:48.994
Are you sure
I'm not being a nuisance?


1163
01:13:49.168 --> 01:13:50.430
Of course not.

1164
01:13:50.603 --> 01:13:53.595
Did you know Johnny Parker,
the actor?


1165
01:13:54.908 --> 01:13:55.932
No.

1166
01:13:57.777 --> 01:13:59.608
Blacklisted.

1167
01:13:59.779 --> 01:14:01.406
He couldn't get arrested.

1168
01:14:01.581 --> 01:14:04.846
Wife, three kids, you can imagine.

1169
01:14:05.018 --> 01:14:07.851
He drove a cab for a while.
Finally gave that up.


1170
01:14:08.021 --> 01:14:12.685
He came from out West. Oklahoma,
Texas, someplace like that.


1171
01:14:12.859 --> 01:14:15.726
He owned a little farm
that his father left him.


1172
01:14:15.895 --> 01:14:20.059
Miserable. He showed me pictures.
You'd go crazy in a place like that.


1173
01:14:20.233 --> 01:14:22.963
But he could grow his own food,
so he went back.


1174
01:14:23.136 --> 01:14:26.731
We had a party for him.
Everybody cried.


1175
01:14:26.906 --> 01:14:31.104
Six months later, right in the middle
of that miserable property...


1176
01:14:31.277 --> 01:14:33.040
...they struck oil!

1177
01:14:33.212 --> 01:14:36.511
-You're kidding?
-Honest to God! Oil!


1178
01:14:36.683 --> 01:14:39.083
He's a millionaire!

1179
01:14:39.252 --> 01:14:40.241
So you see....

1180
01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.912
<i>Every little cloud</i>
<i>Has got a silver lining</i>


1181
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:46.888
-Let me make you another drink.
-No, no, not really.


1182
01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.723
I came, I apologized.
It's time to go.


1183
01:14:50.897 --> 01:14:53.457
What we should do
is have dinner sometime.


1184
01:14:53.633 --> 01:14:55.567
-I'd like that very much.
-Yeah?


1185
01:14:55.735 --> 01:14:59.432
-Well, what about tonight?
-Tonight? No, no, I'm busy.


1186
01:14:59.606 --> 01:15:02.439
So, all right, so why don't--?
I'll call you.


1187
01:15:02.609 --> 01:15:04.736
Don't call us, we'll call you.

1188
01:15:04.911 --> 01:15:10.543
If I had a buck for every time they
said that to me when I first started....


1189
01:15:10.717 --> 01:15:15.279
Of course, I don't have to tell you, later
on, the shoe was on the other foot.


1190
01:15:15.455 --> 01:15:19.687
-I really will call.
-I know you will. I was making a joke.


1191
01:15:19.859 --> 01:15:23.124
-You don't mind I didn't phone?
-Come on, you kidding?


1192
01:15:23.296 --> 01:15:25.230
Well, some people mind.

1193
01:15:25.398 --> 01:15:27.298
You're a good man.

1194
01:15:27.467 --> 01:15:30.698
You know what I think I'll do?
I'll call you tomorrow.


1195
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:36.240
Take care of yourself.
The water is full of sharks.


1196
01:16:07.407 --> 01:16:09.375
Thank you, sir.

1197
01:19:28.774 --> 01:19:30.036
Where have you been?

1198
01:19:30.209 --> 01:19:33.406
I was so worried about you.
I called and there's no answer.


1199
01:19:33.579 --> 01:19:36.173
You know, I was just walking around.

1200
01:19:36.349 --> 01:19:38.044
Are you all right?

1201
01:19:40.219 --> 01:19:43.746
You know, I've been thinking
about a lot of stuff.


1202
01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:48.454
Well, I saved you your dinner.

1203
01:19:48.628 --> 01:19:51.893
I kept it warm for you.
Do you want a drink?


1204
01:19:52.965 --> 01:19:54.626
Yeah, but just a drink.

1205
01:20:10.616 --> 01:20:12.982
I saw you at the funeral today.

1206
01:20:13.152 --> 01:20:15.916
You did? I didn't see you.

1207
01:20:17.323 --> 01:20:19.450
Well, I couldn't handle it.

1208
01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.794
I couldn't handle it either.

1209
01:20:32.071 --> 01:20:36.565
You're lucky you're a writer
and not an actor.


1210
01:20:37.543 --> 01:20:42.105
At least with writers, if he gets
blacklisted, he can always still write.


1211
01:20:42.682 --> 01:20:46.778
An actor, what's he going to do
if he can't show his face?


1212
01:20:51.557 --> 01:20:54.958
How would you feel
if I was not a writer?


1213
01:20:56.862 --> 01:20:58.523
Howard, I know you.

1214
01:20:58.698 --> 01:21:03.499
Whatever else you might have to do
to survive, you'll find time to write.


1215
01:21:05.338 --> 01:21:09.035
Well, suppose I said
that I was not a writer.


1216
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:12.803
I know you as a writer.
I love you.


1217
01:21:12.979 --> 01:21:14.708
Well...

1218
01:21:15.281 --> 01:21:18.682
-...I'm not a writer.
-Don't be a defeatist.


1219
01:21:18.851 --> 01:21:21.581
Other guys wrote those scripts,
not me.


1220
01:21:21.754 --> 01:21:24.314
I put my name on them.
They were blacklisted.


1221
01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:28.893
I was helping them out.
It's my name and their scripts.


1222
01:21:30.196 --> 01:21:32.494
That's a very bizarre statement.

1223
01:21:33.466 --> 01:21:36.128
I'm not a writer, Florence.
I'm a front.


1224
01:21:36.302 --> 01:21:38.702
I front for blacklisted writers.

1225
01:21:40.139 --> 01:21:43.040
-You're not a writer?
-No.


1226
01:21:43.209 --> 01:21:45.439
I couldn't write a grocery list.

1227
01:21:46.212 --> 01:21:50.239
-You never wrote any of those scripts?
-Nothing. Not one.


1228
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:55.187
-I'm practically illiterate.
-You never wrote anything?


1229
01:21:55.354 --> 01:22:00.587
Hey, Jesus, don't get shell-shocked.
I'm not confessing to a murder.


1230
01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.593
Look at you, you're all white.

1231
01:22:03.763 --> 01:22:06.129
-Let me get you a drink.
-I don't want a drink.


1232
01:22:06.298 --> 01:22:08.664
You should put your head
between your legs.


1233
01:22:08.834 --> 01:22:11.667
-You let me think that you were--
-Well, why not?


1234
01:22:11.837 --> 01:22:15.170
What did you want me to do?
For God's sake, I was like a spy.


1235
01:22:15.341 --> 01:22:16.968
Did you want to?

1236
01:22:17.143 --> 01:22:20.544
Did I want to? Of course I wanted to.
You think I liked lying to you?


1237
01:22:20.713 --> 01:22:23.876
Come on, Florence, you know
that lying is not in my nature.


1238
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:26.245
I don't believe this is happening.

1239
01:22:26.419 --> 01:22:29.445
Hey, I have to testify.
Will you keep your mind on that?


1240
01:22:29.622 --> 01:22:31.783
But it's like you're
a complete stranger.


1241
01:22:31.957 --> 01:22:34.391
-So we got off on the wrong foot.
-The wrong foot?


1242
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.552
I was sworn to secrecy.
We're both on the same side.


1243
01:22:37.730 --> 01:22:39.789
-Didn't you trust me?
-I wasn't allowed.


1244
01:22:39.965 --> 01:22:42.763
-Did you think I would lose interest?
-You never were.


1245
01:22:42.935 --> 01:22:46.234
-You were in love with a writer.
-I don't even know you.


1246
01:22:46.405 --> 01:22:48.839
I shouldn't have said anything.
You're hysterical.


1247
01:22:49.008 --> 01:22:50.737
Nobody is hysterical.

1248
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:52.969
Were you gonna mention it
when we were 90?


1249
01:22:53.145 --> 01:22:55.443
-I mentioned it now.
-Because you're in trouble.


1250
01:22:55.614 --> 01:22:57.479
Yes, I'm in trouble.
For a good reason.


1251
01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:01.416
Who was I spying for, Hitler?
I was helping blacklisted writers.


1252
01:23:01.587 --> 01:23:03.521
You lied to me.

1253
01:23:03.689 --> 01:23:05.816
What are you really, a druggist?

1254
01:23:05.991 --> 01:23:09.017
You want to know what I was?
I ran a cash register.


1255
01:23:09.862 --> 01:23:11.352
You were a cashier?

1256
01:23:11.797 --> 01:23:14.265
That's exactly what I mean, see?

1257
01:23:14.433 --> 01:23:18.062
Unless it's a writer or an artist,
catch you in bed with a cashier....


1258
01:23:18.237 --> 01:23:20.728
-That's not fair.
-You wouldn't have looked twice.


1259
01:23:20.906 --> 01:23:24.603
It is not what someone does,
it is who he is.


1260
01:23:24.777 --> 01:23:28.770
-And you don't even know who I am.
-Did you ever give me the chance?


1261
01:23:29.248 --> 01:23:30.647
I'm giving you right now.

1262
01:23:32.685 --> 01:23:34.778
All right.

1263
01:23:37.656 --> 01:23:39.556
Who are you?

1264
01:23:41.026 --> 01:23:43.995
-What?
-I still don't know who you are.


1265
01:23:44.163 --> 01:23:47.223
I only know who you're not.
Who is Howard Prince?


1266
01:23:47.399 --> 01:23:51.563
Hey, Florence, I got to tell you,
it's not easy being in love with you.


1267
01:23:51.737 --> 01:23:56.697
What you're looking for all the time
is a knight on a horse or something.


1268
01:23:56.876 --> 01:23:59.970
Which is not Howard Prince.
You know who Howard Prince is?


1269
01:24:00.146 --> 01:24:03.172
-Howard Prince is his own man.
-What does that mean?


1270
01:24:03.349 --> 01:24:07.376
You'll find out when I come back
from the committee tomorrow.


1271
01:24:07.553 --> 01:24:10.181
What am I going to find?
You said it was all fixed.


1272
01:24:10.356 --> 01:24:13.189
I've been thinking.
Everybody's telling me what to do...


1273
01:24:13.359 --> 01:24:15.054
-...but I don't see why I have to.

1274
01:24:15.227 --> 01:24:18.094
-What are you going to do?
-I'll work something out.


1275
01:24:18.264 --> 01:24:20.357
Are you gonna tell them
you're not a writer?


1276
01:24:20.533 --> 01:24:22.592
I'll tell them exactly what I want to.

1277
01:24:22.768 --> 01:24:26.431
That committee is dangerous. They're
out for blood. You can't fool around.


1278
01:24:26.605 --> 01:24:29.165
All those people, Allie and Sussman,
everything...


1279
01:24:29.341 --> 01:24:31.901
...they're wrong,
because I can beat that committee...


1280
01:24:32.077 --> 01:24:34.705
-...and I can beat them my own way.
-How?


1281
01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.541
What's the difference?

1282
01:24:36.715 --> 01:24:40.344
I'm not going to wind up back at that
cash register. Take my word for it.


1283
01:24:40.519 --> 01:24:43.511
And I'm not going to do anything
that makes you ashamed of me.


1284
01:24:43.689 --> 01:24:47.147
Trust me. Can you trust me?

1285
01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.229
<i>And we would like to thank</i>
<i>this committee...</i>


1286
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.854
<i>And we would like to thank</i>
<i>this committee...</i>


1287
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:54.625
...for allowing Mr. Prince to appear
and voice his approval...


1288
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.032
...of the great work
that you're doing for our country.


1289
01:24:59.205 --> 01:25:03.005
Communist subversion
is a real and present danger...


1290
01:25:03.175 --> 01:25:06.372
...and you can rest assured
that it will never be tolerated...


1291
01:25:06.545 --> 01:25:11.983
...on the network that both Mr. Prince
and I have the honor to represent.


1292
01:25:12.484 --> 01:25:14.645
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.


1293
01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.253
Thank you, sir.

1294
01:25:16.422 --> 01:25:19.050
This committee is here
to help keep America...


1295
01:25:19.225 --> 01:25:21.819
...just as pure
as we possibly can make it.


1296
01:25:21.994 --> 01:25:24.724
Well, I can't think of anything
more important.


1297
01:25:24.897 --> 01:25:26.660
I'd like to commend
this committee...


1298
01:25:26.832 --> 01:25:29.630
-...on the job that they're doing.
-Thank you.


1299
01:25:30.035 --> 01:25:31.627
Counsel.

1300
01:25:32.404 --> 01:25:34.736
Just a few questions.
We know you're a busy man.


1301
01:25:34.907 --> 01:25:38.172
Mr. Prince, do you happen
to know an Alfred Miller?


1302
01:25:40.279 --> 01:25:41.746
Who?

1303
01:25:41.914 --> 01:25:43.541
Alfred Miller.

1304
01:25:44.817 --> 01:25:46.580
Why?

1305
01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.580
If you'd just tell the committee.

1306
01:25:53.025 --> 01:25:55.425
So I can't know why?

1307
01:25:55.594 --> 01:25:58.654
Mr. Prince, you don't have to worry.

1308
01:25:58.831 --> 01:26:02.528
Anyone that comes here and tells the
truth has got nothing to worry about.


1309
01:26:06.705 --> 01:26:10.266
-Which Alfred Miller?
-Do you know Alfred Miller, the writer?


1310
01:26:12.811 --> 01:26:16.838
When you say "know," can you
ever really know a person?


1311
01:26:17.016 --> 01:26:20.713
I grew up with an Alfred Miller,
but do I know him?


1312
01:26:20.886 --> 01:26:22.979
Would you say I know him?
Can you know--?


1313
01:26:23.155 --> 01:26:26.318
In a biblical sense, know him?
Am I right?


1314
01:26:26.492 --> 01:26:30.223
Would that be the same Alfred Miller
you met with several times...


1315
01:26:30.396 --> 01:26:31.954
...in Hammer's Dairy Restaurant?

1316
01:26:33.098 --> 01:26:35.225
-Who says I did?
-Is it or is it not true?


1317
01:26:35.401 --> 01:26:37.528
-No, I asked you first.
-Is it true?


1318
01:26:37.703 --> 01:26:39.796
Is anybody accusing me of anything?

1319
01:26:39.972 --> 01:26:42.202
-Answer the question.
-Which question?


1320
01:26:42.374 --> 01:26:45.502
You asked one question,
I answered that question and then--


1321
01:26:45.678 --> 01:26:49.307
-Do you know Alfred Miller?
-You already asked that question.


1322
01:26:49.481 --> 01:26:51.142
What are you doing?

1323
01:26:51.317 --> 01:26:52.978
What do you mean?
I'm handling it.


1324
01:26:53.152 --> 01:26:56.121
If you don't answer,
they can hold you for contempt.


1325
01:26:56.288 --> 01:26:58.722
I am answering.
I'm just not replying, that's all.


1326
01:26:58.891 --> 01:27:00.051
Don't split hairs.

1327
01:27:00.225 --> 01:27:04.218
They can only get me if I don't answer.
If I answer without replying, I got them.


1328
01:27:04.396 --> 01:27:07.695
-But you're getting them mad.
-What can they do, throw me out?


1329
01:27:07.866 --> 01:27:10.596
Do you know Alfred Miller?

1330
01:27:10.769 --> 01:27:13.465
Are you guys aware that every week...

1331
01:27:13.639 --> 01:27:16.437
...busloads of communists
are coming in over the border?


1332
01:27:16.608 --> 01:27:18.735
Is anybody doing anything
about that?


1333
01:27:18.911 --> 01:27:21.539
We are not concerned
at this time with anything...


1334
01:27:21.714 --> 01:27:24.683
...other than the communist
conspiracy in entertainment.


1335
01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:27.209
Why aren't we doing something
about it?


1336
01:27:27.386 --> 01:27:30.355
Why isn't everybody armed?
Everybody should learn to use a gun.


1337
01:27:30.522 --> 01:27:33.389
It's a mistake anyone who goes
to military school is only--


1338
01:27:33.559 --> 01:27:35.424
You send them there
when they're bad.


1339
01:27:35.594 --> 01:27:38.791
Mr. Prince, this committee
is just as concerned...


1340
01:27:38.964 --> 01:27:41.057
...about the threat of communism
as you are.


1341
01:27:41.233 --> 01:27:44.896
Since your memory
is unclear about Alfred Miller...


1342
01:27:45.404 --> 01:27:47.497
...do you know any of these
other people:


1343
01:27:48.107 --> 01:27:49.369
William Phelps...

1344
01:27:50.175 --> 01:27:51.904
...Herbert Delaney...

1345
01:27:53.245 --> 01:27:54.906
...Florence Barrett...

1346
01:27:56.281 --> 01:27:57.771
...Hershel Brownstein...

1347
01:27:59.017 --> 01:28:01.815
...also known as Hecky Brown?

1348
01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:08.087
-He's dead.
-Did you know him?


1349
01:28:12.398 --> 01:28:14.832
Mr. Prince...

1350
01:28:15.634 --> 01:28:18.728
...now you came here
to cooperate today, did you not?


1351
01:28:21.006 --> 01:28:23.873
Will you excuse us a moment,
Mr. Prince?


1352
01:28:24.042 --> 01:28:26.010
John.

1353
01:28:31.183 --> 01:28:32.741
I thought we had an arrangement.

1354
01:28:32.918 --> 01:28:35.079
With the network.
He's doing this by himself.


1355
01:28:35.254 --> 01:28:38.052
-Hit him with contempt.
-He's not giving us any grounds.


1356
01:28:38.223 --> 01:28:40.453
We can't let him get away with this.

1357
01:28:40.626 --> 01:28:44.118
Now, there's got to be something
that you can just nail him on.


1358
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:45.619
Okay.

1359
01:28:50.335 --> 01:28:53.634
Mr. Prince, let me ask you
another question.


1360
01:28:54.373 --> 01:28:58.036
Do you know a Patrick Callahan?

1361
01:28:59.645 --> 01:29:00.634
Who?

1362
01:29:01.447 --> 01:29:04.041
Bartender at the Friendly Tavern...

1363
01:29:04.216 --> 01:29:07.117
...where, I believe, you once worked
as a night cashier.


1364
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.751
I did?

1365
01:29:09.922 --> 01:29:11.856
Do you know Daniel LaGattuta?

1366
01:29:15.828 --> 01:29:17.193
Doesn't he sell fruit?

1367
01:29:17.362 --> 01:29:21.389
You placed bets for Mr. Callahan
and Mr. LaGattuta, did you not?


1368
01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.805
In a strictly friendly way.

1369
01:29:32.744 --> 01:29:35.542
I remind you that placing bets
is a crime.


1370
01:29:36.315 --> 01:29:40.046
Howard, is this true?
You were a bookmaker?


1371
01:29:40.219 --> 01:29:43.711
-Not professionally.
-Oh, my God.


1372
01:29:43.889 --> 01:29:48.326
Mr. Chairman, may I have
a word with you, please?


1373
01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:02.571
They're willing to make a deal.

1374
01:30:03.242 --> 01:30:06.109
-Give them names, right?
-They're being very reasonable.


1375
01:30:06.278 --> 01:30:09.179
You don't have to give them
more than one.


1376
01:30:10.616 --> 01:30:12.846
-Yeah, which one?
-It's up to you.


1377
01:30:13.018 --> 01:30:16.613
They've got you over a barrel.
You can go to jail. What's one name?


1378
01:30:16.788 --> 01:30:20.519
If it bothers you,
give them Hecky Brown.


1379
01:30:23.395 --> 01:30:25.260
-Hecky?
-He's dead anyway.


1380
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:27.295
What difference does it make?

1381
01:30:30.802 --> 01:30:33.498
A token, that's all they want.
Show your cooperation.


1382
01:30:33.672 --> 01:30:36.835
-Is the witness ready to proceed?
-Yes, ready, Mr. Chairman.


1383
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:42.102
Mr. Prince, I ask you
for the record...


1384
01:30:42.281 --> 01:30:45.375
...did you know Hershel Brownstein?

1385
01:30:47.185 --> 01:30:49.745
Howard, you'll go to jail.

1386
01:30:49.922 --> 01:30:52.322
Also known as Hecky Brown?

1387
01:30:52.791 --> 01:30:53.780
Be practical.

1388
01:30:53.959 --> 01:30:56.223
Did you know him
as either Brown or Brownstein?


1389
01:30:56.395 --> 01:30:59.626
-Either name will do, Mr. Prince.
-Tell them.


1390
01:30:59.798 --> 01:31:01.766
-Brown or Brownstein.
-Just the name.


1391
01:31:01.934 --> 01:31:03.834
Are you refusing to answer?

1392
01:31:04.002 --> 01:31:05.902
Will you talk?

1393
01:31:09.641 --> 01:31:11.609
Fellas...

1394
01:31:14.546 --> 01:31:18.448
...I don't recognize
the right of this committee...


1395
01:31:18.617 --> 01:31:21.211
...to ask me these kind of questions.

1396
01:31:22.821 --> 01:31:27.190
And furthermore, you can all
go fuck yourselves.
