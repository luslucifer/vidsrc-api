Yeah, those were good times.

187
00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.772
We had 60 people at the most,

188
00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.741
and all we did was
preach the gospel.

He's right, no masks.

What if you dial
it back for a year?

Just not so sure everybody's
gonna be as understanding.

00:52:12.432 --> 00:52:17.269
And it's probably going to be
upsetting to certain people.

00:52:20.138 --> 00:52:22.040
Thanks, Tino.

Let's keep this between us,

but you've been a big help.

1459

I think it is so cool that
you're talking to my parents.

00:52:45.532 --> 00:52:46.633
[Carla] Blaise, that's great.

1468
00:52:46.666 --> 00:52:48.200
I was nervous you'd be upset.

1469

Nah, the Cameron
family doesn't get upset.

That may change today

once I tell 'em what's going on.

1472

They're gonna be
really upset, Blaise.

Wow.

Anyway, those
are just 10 reasons


1484
00:53:27.907 --> 00:53:30.376
why Blaise shouldn't
be crucified.

You make a compelling
case, I must say.

And I wanna affirm you in that,

1487
00:53:35.314 --> 00:53:36.883
the same way we affirm Blaise

1488

in whatever makes him happy.

Blaise is going to be crucified.

You make it sound so negative.

1511

Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,

1512
00:54:44.751 --> 00:54:47.219
crucifixion is not
a positive thing.


1513

- It's a horrible-
- Nah, nu-uh-uh.


1514
00:54:49.254 --> 00:54:50.590
Not necessarily.

1515
00:54:51.524 --> 00:54:53.191
Doesn't your religion contend,

1516
00:54:53.225 --> 00:54:56.896
that Jesus paid for your
sins through crucifixion?


1517
00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:00.800
- Yeah, but-
- So it is positive.

him to do this?

Well, you're still
not getting it, dear.

We don't allow him
to do anything.

Honey, if following
Jesus makes me a freak,

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.637
we can talk about the crucifixion
for a few thousand people,


1592

You bring 'em in with the show,

and you give 'em a little
nibble of the truth.

You have completely
lost your way.

On behalf of Sand Hills

01:18:07.319 --> 01:18:09.655
I wanna welcome
you to Good Friday.

what you are about to
experience might be disturbing.

makes you queasy,

we ask that you move to the
fainting rooms in the back.

to see is not a play.

Awesome!

2155
01:20:34.867 --> 01:20:35.834
Let's crucify him!

[audience cheers and applauds]

2157
01:20:43.943 --> 01:20:47.146
Does crucifixion means
something different here?


2158
01:20:47.179 --> 01:20:48.180
I hope so.

2159
01:20:50.182 --> 01:20:54.787
The last words Jesus
spoke on the cross were,


2160
01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.222
"It is finished".

2161
01:21:00.025 --> 01:21:02.361
And by "finished",
he meant done,


2162
01:21:02.395 --> 01:21:04.897
over, accomplished, completed.

2163
01:21:07.066 --> 01:21:11.870
And yet, we're still going
to have a crucifixion today.


2164
01:21:12.805 --> 01:21:13.506
All right.

2165
01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.875
[audience cheers and applauds]

2166
01:21:16.909 --> 01:21:20.279
You know, Skip, we
do go back a long way.


2167
01:21:20.312 --> 01:21:22.815
When you started this,

2168
01:21:22.848 --> 01:21:24.517
you were just looking
for creative ways


2169
01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:27.554
to tell people about Jesus,

2170
01:21:27.587 --> 01:21:29.855
and this thing blew up.

2171
01:21:30.856 --> 01:21:33.192
And then our Youth
Program blew up,


2172
01:21:33.225 --> 01:21:38.230
and people around the country
started asking me what I did.


2173
01:21:39.098 --> 01:21:40.866
So I went around the country

2174
01:21:42.502 --> 01:21:43.536
praying to this.

for some people.


2177
01:21:53.078 --> 01:21:54.813
Couldn't be that simple.

2178
01:21:54.847 --> 01:21:56.148
And I wanted to
hold their interest.


2179
01:21:56.181 --> 01:21:58.951
I tried to hold their interest.

2180
01:22:00.019 --> 01:22:04.089
And then one day, I woke
up the "Beach Ball Guy".


2181
01:22:05.858 --> 01:22:09.529
You don't become the
"Beach Ball Guy" overnight.

You become the "Beach
Ball Guy" slowly.

more than I realized.

I could have stopped.

You know, Skip, you were right.

I've been part of everything
that's gone on here,

but I blamed you alone,

01:22:39.659 --> 01:22:41.860
and for that, I'm sorry.

Well, I promised
you a crucifixion.
