2
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.878
What the fuck are you doing, bruv?

3
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.474
Hiya, Burberry. 
What's going on?

4
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.835
You cool?

5
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.629
Sorry I'm late and that, but...
you got that money?


6
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.872
You come here
no more unless you buy drink.


7
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.712
- What?
- I tell you last week.


8
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.839
- Don't fuckin' touch me.
- I'll call the police. Come on, get out.


9
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.070
You taking me for a idiot, yeah?

10
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.708
Fuck off out of here,
you fucking dirty crackhead!


11
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.952
Fuck off! Don't come here no more.
I call the police.


12
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.270
"I call the police. "

13
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.919
You coming or what?

14
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.913
- You coming or what?
- No touch my window!


15
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.039
- No come back!
- I'll break you up and that. Fuck you.


16
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.760
Are you coming or what, blud?

17
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.118
Eh, I aint got all day, you know.
I'm a busy man.


18
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.111
So come on, man.

19
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.033
Oi, I got this thing set, you know.

20
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.194
I've been out here all night
trying to arrange this thing for you.


21
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.715
All right, boy. Safe.

22
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.959
You don't usually
catch me up King's Cross.


23
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.237
Feds are well tight on
the begging ting up there.


24
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.155
But these are my blocks, though.
This is where I grew up. Since I was ten.


25
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.199
You get me? These are my ends, blud.
Home of the brave.


26
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.353
Well, it was like I was running
the block in them days.


27
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.958
Oi. I just wanna go in the shop and
get a drink, yeah? Cool.


28
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.429
Ah, blud.

29
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.514
You know what?

30
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.468
Rarr, I left my money
in my yard, innit.


31
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.278
Show me a quid, innit.

32
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.671
Till we get back to my house. One pound?
Nothing, man.


33
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.116
Pay you back when we
get back to my yard.


34
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.355
It's a hundred pence. It's nothing, blud.
Come on. Yeah, yeah.


35
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.991
Oh, you know what, one-fifty, actually.
Is that cool, yeah? Safe. Back in a minute.


36
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.875
What? What you looking at,
you prick?


37
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.720
What a twat.

38
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.635
- Look at that.
- Wanker!


39
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.636
Thank you, Khan.

40
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.234
That's big. Come on, let's go.

41
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.149
King's Cross.
What was you doing up there?


42
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.598
- It's near where I work.
- You must have a well nice job, innit?


43
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.550
It's my block up there still,
you know. Look.


44
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.280
The one with the, erm, pink curtains.

45
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.274
I had blue curtains, though.
Not pink ones, you get me?


46
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.273
- You all right, Chela?
- Yeah, D, safe.


47
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.750
- Cool, cool. All right, doll. Yeah?
- Where are you going?


48
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.230
Eh, just gotta go and sort out
this geezer, yeah?


49
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.076
- I'll come and check you later, all right?
- Yeah.


50
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.037
That's Michela, man.

51
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.796
Her mum's on the game.
Live in that block up there.


52
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.436
Every time her mum's got a punter, yeah,
she sends her out there to sit about.


53
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.479
Know what the worst thing is?
Everyone knows, blud.


54
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.632
So, imagine that.
Michela knows that everyone knows.


55
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.119
Ssh. This is my yard, bruv.
You get me?


56
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:06.919
Not my... my yard, but the place I come to
when I got things a gwaan. You get me?


57
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.592
Blud... no-one else knows about
this place, you know.


58
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.152
This is kinda like...

59
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.952
.. my secret den.

60
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.358
- Give me your coat.
- I want to be in and out.


61
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.954
- What?
- I just want to get on with this.


62
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.351
Bruv, just take off your coat.
Chill out, man.


63
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.549
S'cool. Cool.

64
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.590
All right. I told you, I knew it.
Burberry. Sick. Sick. Top.


65
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.793
Oh, my days.
Look that's proper tings.


66
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.669
Proper tings, blud. Proper tings.

67
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.118
Why you ain't tell me you had vodka?
I'd have bought Coke. You get me?


68
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.397
Vodka and coke.
That's my favourite drink.


69
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.269
It's what I drink when I'm
up in the clubs in Soho.


70
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.273
You don't mind, do you?
Down, man.


71
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.637
Mmm.

72
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.677
Mmm.

73
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.877
That's wicked. That's big! Big!

74
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.837
Bubbling.

75
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.675
Take a seat. Just relax, man.
Come on, what's wrong with you?


76
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.400
Come, have a little drink and that.

77
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.959
Chill out.

78
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.156
Mm... come, man.

79
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.715
Are you lonely or something?

80
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.553
- What?
- Are you lonely?


81
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.236
- What you trying to say, blud?
- I just want to get on with this.


82
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.233
All right. Fuck it.

83
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.279
Fuck it. Show me the fucking money.
Go on.


84
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.079
Nice, boy.

85
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.071
£750.

86
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.878
What?

87
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.395
£750.

88
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.233
- I told you 800, though.
- I gave you £50 yesterday.


89
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.549
- You didn't.
- I did.


90
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.314
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.


91
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.555
Yeah, yeah, that £50,
that's just a residual, blud.


92
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.233
- What?
- Residuals.


93
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.915
That's how tings go
on the street, bruv. Get me?


94
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.230
- That's not a residual.
- Yeah, it is.


95
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.029
- A residual is a... It's a form of royalty.
- Yeah, yeah, royalty. Yeah.


96
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.236
Honourable bond. 
Chivalry and all that.

97
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.755
- So that was a down payment?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


98
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.195
Right, then here's the rest.

99
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.113
Don't get clever, you know, rich man.

100
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.115
That was a guarantee that I'd sort this
out. And you was right for your dollars.


101
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.510
I was checking that you weren't no Feds,

102
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.513
you was checking
that I wasn't either, innit?


103
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.910
- What? Feds?
- Feds, man.


104
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.356
Po-po, Old Bill, five-oh, one time.

105
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.153
Yeah, I think anybody can tell
you're not a policeman.


106
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.356
What you trying to say?

107
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.478
You know what?
Easy with that stuck-up shit!


108
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.031
This is my world you're in now,
rich man. My yard!


109
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.799
My God! You must think 'cause I look
like some poor crackhead that's all I am.


110
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.109
I've got connections!

111
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.030
Fuck! Fucking prick!

112
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.636
- Fuck!
- Michael, what's happened?


113
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.358
Michael?

114
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.875
What's up?

115
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.031
Where are you going?

116
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.031
Out.

117
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.398
What do you mean?
I don't understand. What's happened?


118
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.039
Michael, please.

119
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.395
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out.


120
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.551
Are you going to tell me what's
going on? Michael?


121
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.429
What's happened? Where are you going?
Where are you going?


122
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.397
For fuck's sake, Tania!

123
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.311
Where you taking his stuff? Just tell me
where you're going. It's all I'm asking you.


124
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.873
Look... I have got a problem,
and I am going to sort it out right now.


125
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.271
OK? Right fucking now.

126
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.919
Michael!

127
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.437
You came 50 pound light!
I told you 800.


128
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.750
Well, I've got 750!

129
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.388
- We have to go to the cashpoint.
- We can't.


130
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.120
- Why not?
- I don't have my cashcard on me!


131
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.829
Ah... what else you got?
What else you got on you? Huh?


132
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.953
What the hell is this?

133
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.749
Ahh. Nice photo.
You look ill, boy.


134
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.832
Ho.. Ho.. Ho-ra-tee-o.

135
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.638
Horatio.

136
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.392
Horatio Bainbridge.

137
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.232
You said your name was Tom.

138
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.630
Well, would you go around calling
yourself Horatio?


139
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.358
Yeah.

140
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.037
- What the fuck is this?
- It's my work pass.


141
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.909
What the fuck do I want that for,
you prick?


142
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.230
Listen, don't play with me, an' that.

143
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.550
I roll deep, blud. Tellin' you.

144
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.914
- You can't go out like this.
- Get the fuck...


145
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.672
- Get out the way.
- You ain't going.


146
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.273
- Get out the way.
- No.


147
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.908
- Get out the way.
- No.


148
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.753
Get out the fucking way!

149
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.275
- Fuck!
- Michael...


150
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.353
Michael, Michael. You're gonna

151
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.195
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about us.


152
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.749
Michael... listen.

153
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.309
Wherever you're going,
I don't care.


154
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.392
I don't mind. I understand,
you got business.


155
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.994
Michael, you got to do it calm,

156
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.550
or you're gonna do something bad.

157
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.109
Look, it worked the other night.

158
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.874
No, it worked. 
It worked, darling.

Eh, what about that ring? Uh?

184
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.955
- What?
- The ring in your pocket, man.


185
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.635
- That's worth a little more than 50.
- Is that my problem, though? Uh?


186
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.155
Fact is you came 50 pound light.

187
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.235
If I don't get what's coming to me
you ain't gonna get what's coming to you.


188
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.991
- Is it gold, yeah?

189
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.798
- And what about that watch?
- What?


190
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.032
- The watch!
- Are you being serious?


191
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.988

Look. You gave me the ring.

201

Is the parrot in the window? Huh?

206
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.870
Is the fucking parrot
in the fucking window?


207
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.076
- No.
- Huh?


208
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.312
- It's not. No.
- It's not, you fucking pinhead prick.


209
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.030
But, Hoods, man, I'm rattling.

Money up front, man.

217
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.958

218
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.951
No.

233
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.632
D would've never get through that front
door if him was broke. Trust me.


234
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.155
- How much did he have?

235
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.551

Eh...

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.916
this is a good buy for 800 pound,

251
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.595
For 750, this is a bargain.

252
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.037
Michela. You seen D today?

258
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.111
Who was he with?

259
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.114
- Ain't seen him before.
- What was he like?


260
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.352
Some white guy. D said
he was gonna sort him out.


261
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.550
Fuck!

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.157
So what was he like, this white guy?

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.151
Where did they go?

267
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.031
You know, like... your mum
sometimes gives me money.


268
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.316
You know, 'cause she needs me.

269
00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.110
Well, er, I need you
to do something for me.


270
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.239
You have got to
tell me where D is.

271
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.629
I need to look at it.

272
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.030
There it is.

273
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.953
Yeah, that could be a replica.

274
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.999
This is a. 38 snubnose.

275
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.152
Saturday Night Special.

276
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.233
Can do some serious damage
with this thing, you know, bredren.


277
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.630
- They went down there.
- The other fella too?


278
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.438
Yeah.

279
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.278
Trust me, rude boy.

280
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.479
Look...

281
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.715
You're making something
simple very complicated.


282
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.189
- I'm a marksman, bruv.
- Just show me the gun.


283
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.590
Shh. Shh.

284
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.957
- If I like what I see, I'll pay you.
- I'm an assassin.


285
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.590
- I guarantee it.
- Whap, whap, whap...


286
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.878
All right? As soon as
I've paid, I will leave.


287
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.951
Yeah?

288
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.156
As soon as I've left, you can...

289
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.949
You can run down the local drug den,
you can blow the whole lot.


290
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.031
Huh?

291
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.510
- Money on the table, bruv.
- Oh, come on.


292
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:38.392
Come on, do I look like I'm about to
take the gun and shoot you?


293
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.552
No. No, you don't.

294
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.718
But that's not the question
you should be asking yourself.


295
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.598
Fact is...

296
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.797
do I look like I'm about to
shoot you? Hm?


297
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.634
Uh?

298
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.351
Why don't you judge me on the way
I look, rich man?


299
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.956
I'm a bloodclot crackhead.

300
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.635
Which means I'm
a dangerous man to know.


301
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.790
What you laughing at?

302
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.033
What the fuck are you laughing at, man?

303
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.595
I swear to God, don't test me,
you know, rich man.


304
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.793
Oi, I've killed nuff people,
you know, blud.


305
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.160
Now, you just move back to where you
come from, with the knowledge that


306
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.189
you just had a little brush with
a gun-toting crackhead and you lived.


307
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.352
Yeah?

308
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.116
Put your money on the table
and get the fuck out.


309
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.038
- Give me the gun.
- What the fuck...


310
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.875
- No.
- Come on.


311
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.231
- Get off me! What the fuck are you doing?
- Fucking give it to me..


312
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.832
You're crazy...

313
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.792
You fucking dirty fucker.
Give it to me!


314
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.589
Give it to me!

315
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.639
Come on! Come on! 
Come on, you...!

316
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.995
- You fucker!
- What you doin'?


317
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.598
D?

318
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.432
Get off!

319
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.630
You fucking gaybo!

320
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.918
For fuck's sake, D,
put that wee thing away.


321
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.673
Hoods!

322
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.714
What's going on, man?

323
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.474
Fine?

324
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.154
Who the fuck is that?

325
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.675
Since when have you been selling
your arse? Huh?


326
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.355
Since when have you
been selling your arse?


327
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.796
- Hoods, man, I ain't selling my arse, blud.
- Oh.


328
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.999
So what were you doing, huh,
when I came in?


329
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.875
- How much money you been making?
- I said...


330
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:56.434
I know you been making money 'cause
you was over at Crystal's last night!


331
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.478
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I ain't selling my arse.


332
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.315
You didn't tell me because you owe me
money, you little fucking crackhead.


333
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.630
You owe me fucking money!

334
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.836
Get up the fucking stairs!

335
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.439
No, wait, wait.

336
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.953
I've got to have words with D.

337
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.476
If I see you before I've gone,

338
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.916
I'll fucking ruin you.

339
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.196
Gaybo.

340
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.996
Eh, Hoods, man. 
Low it, low it!

341
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.870
What the fuck are you doing?
What did I say two weeks ago?


342
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.192
- Didn't I tell you to lie low?
- I've been lying low! I ain't been nowhere!


343
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.113
So where did your man Gay Bollocks
come from?


344
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.831
- I met him on the street.
- Where did he fucking come from?


345
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.390
- I met him on the street!
- Oh, did you?


346
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.471
On the fucking street?

347
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.357
Hey, low it! Hey, 
Hoods, please...! Stop!

348
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:24.073
- You fucking stupid...
- I swear. I ain't told him nothing, man!


349
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.959
Shit. What are you doing, Hoods?
Don't! Shit...!


350
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.112
- What does it look like?
- Shit! Shit!


351
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.670
You don't go picking up
some gaybo pervert off the street


352
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.831
three weeks after what
we've done.


353
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.277
You fucking don't...

354
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.158
- Peace!
- I'm going down for life.


355
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.869
Hoods, I didn't even do anything,
though, man!


356
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.477
- Blud!
- Yes, you fucking did!


357
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.359
Shit!

358
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.877
Fuck, it's in here! Fuck!

359
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.634
Jesus Christ, it's in here!

360
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.349
Your man down there
could be Special Branch, D!


361
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.115
Oh, fuck!

362
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.555
OK, man, just breathe.

363
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.072
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.


364
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.755
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.


365
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.150
Nam myoho renge kyo!

366
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.873
OK, so... so I got a question
that I got to ask you.


367
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.554
About your money?
The money that I owe you?


368
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.713
Hoods, listen. I'm trying to get your money
but things are just way out...


369
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.919
I've been trying to
get your money, I swear!

370
00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.548
Everything's messed up.
Remember? I came to your house


371
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.872
- and you were safe about it. Remember?
- Exactly.


372
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.235
You came round my gaff last night.

373
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.789
Hm?

374
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.598
Hm?

375
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.479
So where's my fucking gun?

376
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.471
So where's my fucking gun?

377
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.710
I don't know where your gun is.

378
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.590
- I ain't taken your gun, I swear.
- Jesus! OK. All right.


379
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.914
So how come my. 38 was nice
and snug under my bath, right?


380
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.993
And you come over last night,
and then by this morning it's gone?


381
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.472
I swear, Hoods. I swear, man.
I didn't go in your bathroom, blud.


382
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:45.272
I didn't even go in your bathroom, Hoods.
I was in your front room the whole time.


383
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.479
I was in the front room
the whole time. Remember?


384
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.672
Please. I swear, 
I didn't take...

385
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.718
Oi, fuck you!

386
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.351
Shit, hold on. It must have been
one of Sef's crew, man. I swear.


387
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.751
They came round.

388
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.959
Do you remember? Yeah?
They came round, man.


389
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.997
Sef came to buy weed, yeah.

390
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.312
He was with those two guys
you never met before.


391
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.232
Ray and Gary.

392
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.790
That Gary's well into his weapons.
Hoods, I swear...


393
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.838
- Fucking bollocks!
- I swear!


394
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.470
How could some fucker who has never
been round my gaff before


395
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.155
know where to look?

396
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.155
That's why it's Ray, man!
I'm telling you. He lives...


397
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.390
He lives in them flats.

398
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.474
He lives in them flats, man.
Cambridge Tower.


399
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:59.034
It's just the same as your block up there,
Hoods, I swear. It's the same. Fuck!


400
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.350
That gun has got a hit on it,
as well you know.


401
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:14.153
That gun has got a minimum of

402
00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.795
- Where is it?
- For fuck's sake...


403
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.633
Where the fuck is it, D?

404
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.631
Fuck you!

405
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.870
That's enough!

406
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.468
How much does he owe you?

407
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.709
How much?

408
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.789
If I pay you
his debt, will you leave?

409
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.196
How much?

410
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.557
270 quid.

411
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.954
Did I not tell you to stay
in that fucking room?


412
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.029
Who the fuck are you? Hm?

413
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.192
The Old Bill? You come to nick me,
have you?


414
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.148
Yeah? Well, go on, then. Go on.
Fucking cuff me up, Officer!


415
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.880
Come on, then.
Fucking cuff me up, Officer!


416
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.158
Hey? Eh? Cuff me fucking up!
No? No, I thought not.


417
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.233
You baggy gaybo pervert coming round
here to spend your money


418
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.392
on a young man's arse.
Shame on you!


419
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.998
Think you're rich do you? Huh?

420
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.990
Flashing your cash at me,
in your suit, huh?


421
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.720
Well, check it out.

422
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.111
Check it fucking out!

423
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.319
Hoods... Hoods... Hoods.

424
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.152
You see?

425
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.757
Look, I told, I told, I told you
he weren't Feds, innit?


426
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:47.436
And I got your money for you
as well, man.


427
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.149
I was... I
-I
-I was gonna..

428
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.153
I was gonna sell my arse
for you, Hoody. Fuck!


429
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.393
Yeah! I was gonna sell my arse
to get you the money.


430
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.278
Jesus! Jesus!

431
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.591
I never took your gun, man.

432
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.275
It was Ray. I'm telling you,
it was Ray, man.


433
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.672
He... he lives in them...
them places. In.. in Cambridge Towers.


434
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.990
They're the same as your place.

435
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.435
That's how he knew about
the bath thing.


436
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.752
Yeah?

437
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.592
Sef. It's the Hood.

438
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.316
Hold on, mate. 
Hold on a sec, yeah?

439
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.233
Hoods, mate,
just give me a second, yeah?


440
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.630
- What are you doing?
- Seen my Nike top?


441
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.519
I'm on the phone. Get out!

442
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.399
Get out, man!

443
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.073
Mum!

444
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.672
Hoods. 'S up?

445
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.672
Where are you?

446
00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.798
Just chillin' at my mum's yard, dude.
What's up?


447
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.157
Don't matter. I'm coming over.

448
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.392
Meet me outside Cambridge Tower.

449
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.951
And bring Ray and that other little fucker

450
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.829
who came round my gaff last night. Gary.

451
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.195
Hoods, mate, I can't. 
I've got college.

452
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.796
Fuck your college. Ten minutes.

453
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.196
You better hope and pray...

454
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.270
.. that Ray has got my gun.

455
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.510
Nam myoho renge kyo.
Nam myoho renge kyo.


456
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.429
Ray. It's Sef. 
You with Gary, yeah?

457
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.955
Hoodwink wants to meet us.

458
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.475
No. Like, now.

459
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.278
I don't fucking know.

460
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.355
Just get to the garages, yeah?
Make sure Gary comes with you.


461
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.071
What the fuck is up with you, man?

462
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.716
You don't take on the Hood
like that, blud.


463
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.431
Trust me to pick some
fucking nutter to rob.


464
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.751
Trust me to pick some nutter
to buy a gun off.


465
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.275
- What you say?
- I said,


466
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:30.833
trust me to pick some fucked-up,
crackhead nutcase to buy a gun off.


467
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.275
Want a fucking go with me, yeah?

468
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.910
I will bust a cap in your skull,
I'm telling you.


469
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.116
Fucking prick.

470
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.990
Do you know who that was?
It's Hoodwink, blud. It's the Hood.


471
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.716
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.

472
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.269
I couldn't give a shit.

473
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.749
I've met some nutters in my time, but...

474
00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.948
you're fucking up there, mate.
Right up there. Shit.


475
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.832
I want the gun.

476
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.471
Fuck off, man.
You ain't getting the fucking gun.


477
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.359
You know what?

478
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.717
In fact, ride's up, man.

479
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.632
- Time to go.
- I want the gun.


480
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.837
- You ain't getting it.
- I paid for it.


481
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.592
- You ain't.
- I paid your debt.


482
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.036
That's your problem.
I didn't ask you to do that. Step, man.


483
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.830
What are you doing? Get out of the way.
Do you want me to shoot you, yeah?


484
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.595
I fucking told you already.
This thing can do some serious damage.


485
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.514
Do you want me
to tear off your face?

486
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.638
Come on. I'm being serious.
Just fuck it off.


487
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.352
Go back to your rich man life.
Come on, get out of the way.


488
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.799
You know what? I got a better idea.
You stay here, yeah? Wait for Hoodwink.


489
00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.034
- I'll be seeing you later, rich man.
- Give me the fucking gun!


490
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.270
Give me the gun!

491
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.031
Give me the gun!

492
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.316
Give me the fucking gun!
Give me the gun!


493
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.673
Oh, shit!

494
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.559
Oi, for fuck's sake, man, just...

495
00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:40.716
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.


496
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.313
Stop this shit!

497
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.190
You fuck. Fuck.
You fucker. Fuck.


498
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.676
Fucking hell!

499
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.110
Oi, rich man. What are you doin'?

500
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.114
You fucker. You fucker. You...

501
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.793
fucker!

502
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.757
Oh... shit!

503
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.911
Arghh!

504
00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.873
Oi, rich man!

505
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.272
Look, I don't know
what your beef is, man...


506
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.316
Oi, please, blud.

507
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.550
I'm just a little crackhead, man.

508
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.756
Rich man...

509
00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.595
You fucker!

510
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.876
You fuuuuck!

511
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.272
I don't know
why he wants to see us!


512
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.513
- What you getting vexed for, man?
- Stop asking me. I don't fucking know!


513
00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.989
- Did he sound pissed off?
- Fuck's sake.


514
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.557
Shit.

515
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.834
Hoods, what's wrong man?

516
00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.398
- What did you take from my bathroom?
- I didn't take nothing, man.


517
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.236
- What did you take from my bathroom?
- I didn't take nothing, Hoods!


518
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.993
- Where's my fucking gun?
- I don't know nothing about no gun.


519
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.593
- Ahh!
- Where's my gun?


520
00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:19.039
- Where's my... fucking... gun, you prick!
- I don't know nothing about no gun.


521
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.872
- Why does D say you do?
- Wha..?


522
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.113
- Why does D say you stole my gun?
- I don't know what you're talking about.


523
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.839
None of you three move.

524
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.558
Hello, Paul. How're you doing?

525
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.995
Aye.

526
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.550
Oh, it was today was it?
I thought it was, er...


527
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.551
I thought it was tomorrow.

528
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.394
No, no, no, no, no.
No problem, man.


529
00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.076
No, the... the parrot is always
in the window for you, man.


530
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.075
Huh? I can be round
in, er... about ten minutes.


531
00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.152
OK, just, er... knock on the...
knock on the door.


532
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.438
Tania's there and she'll...
Get her to make you a cup of tea.


533
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.910
Ten minutes. OK? See you then, Paul.

534
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:22.074
- We don't know nothing about no gun.
- Shut the fuck up!


535
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.390
My gun was taken,
and I want it back.


536
00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.676
I don't care who brings it back.

537
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.876
What type of gun was it?

538
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.589
Wh... what type of gun... is it?

539
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.558
It's a... it's a. 38.

540
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.358
What, like a snubnose?

541
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.759
Yeah.

542
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.037
- Nice.
- Yeah, yeah, I like that.


543
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.952
I want my gun back.

544
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.190
I don't care who brings it back.

545
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.352
We ain't got it,
though. It must be D.

546
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.239
- Go and see D.
- What if we can't find him?


547
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.870
That crackhead's all over the place.
He ain't even got a place to live.


548
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.996
You know those warehouses up on...

549
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.355
- Sugarhouse Lane. Hmm?
- Yeah.


550
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.273
Ten minutes ago, he was
selling his arse up there.


551
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.714
- Selling his arse?
- Yeah.


552
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.836
D's some sort of battie-boy?

553
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.594
Rarr, that is nasty.

554
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:19.630
Yeah, so if I was you,
I'd get up there, quick as, OK?


555
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.473
I'm watching this watch and...

556
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.631
you've got an hour. Tops.

557
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.277
'Ey, I swear, blud.

558
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.433
I swear, you know.
If you move to me like that again...


559
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.194
I'm going to fucking shoot.

560
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.430
I will fucking shoot you, blud.

561
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.750
You hear me, rich man?

562
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.669
Rich man? I'm telling you, blud.

563
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.238
Hey, I got my finger on the trigger.

564
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.073
You gonna get shot, blud.

565
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.751
- I ain't feeling this.
- I can't let this go.


566
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.990
- Yeah, but...
- No, look at me!


567
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.628
I ain't taken the gun,
you ain't taken it,


568
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.360
Gary ain't,
which means D must have taken it.


569
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.512
I ain't getting fucked up like this
without payback.


570
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.717
We don't need to fuck D up,
we just need to get the gun.


571
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.757
- We need to fuck him up.
- We need...


572
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.674
Fuck that shit! D grassed me up.
And he's a battie-boy.


573
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.310
I'm gonna fuck D up, man. Straight.

574
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.436
Where the fuck is Gary, anyway, man?

575
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.234
Oh, for fuck's sake, man,
answer your fucking door!


576
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.709
Oh, I can't find my weed, you know.

577
00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.915
What?

578
00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.913
I got a big bag
of skunk I can't find.

579
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.119
What? Fuck your weed, Gary, man!
We got big things to do, blud!


580
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.909
Fuck's sake! Fucking weedhead prick.

581
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.911
Hurry the fuck up!

582
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.119
You fucking took your time!

583
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:50.671
Yeah, but you know how it is, cuz.
Anyway. Fuck that. Check this.


584
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.633
Them nunchakus are nang, blud.

585
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.360

586
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.478
What? You can have that, man.
That's the tonfa.


587
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.313
Proper ashwood, you know. Cold.

588
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.833

589
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.992
- What?

590
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.912
- I thought you was my bredren.

591
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.152
- Then take the tonfa.
- What you talking about, you ain't coming?


592
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:27.314
- We have to get this gun, man.
- Take the fucking tonfa, Sef.


593
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.840
Now.

594
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.476
Listen, yeah?

595
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.993
Blud, just ke... 
Stay calm, yeah?

596
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.312
All right?

597
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.792
I don't want any more trouble.
I want no more trouble, rich man, all right?


598
00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.394
I just want the gun, that's all.

599
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.714
Just give me the gun and I'm gone.

600
00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.030
- Please.
- No, man. You don't want the gun.


601
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.317
That's what I'm trying to say, rich man.

602
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.917
Wh...? Your business partner
rip you off or something? Huh?


603
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.437
And you're gonna shoot him?
That's bullshit, man.


604
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.833
Hey...

605
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.070
Wait.

606
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.710
It's about this, innit?

607
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.030
Your wife left you, yeah?

608
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.152
That's why you're here.

609
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.436
So, er... now you wanna go...
You wanna go shoot her new man?


610
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.318
Is that it?

611
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.879
Gonna go murk that prick.

612
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.874
Ain't worth it, blud.

613
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.350
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah. I do.


614
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.069
I do know what
I'm talking about, blud. All right?


615
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.593
No woman's worth...

616
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.228
ruining your life over.

617
00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.350
Nah, man.

618
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.875
I got one ting to say to you.

619
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.678
Dat is lame.

620
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.990
Lame?!

621
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.119
I gave that woman
six years of my life.


622
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.430
Ah, what would you know?

623
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.909
You've probably never
given anybody anything.


624
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.469
- I've given nuff people stuff, blud.
- Like?


625
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.552
I always give Michela stuff.

626
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.837
Yeah, and I give Briony
some wicked perfume.


627
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.355
She was well chuffed.

628
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.471
The next day,
she come up to me, she said, "D...


629
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.757
"D, I'm only nineteen, yeah...

630
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:59.435
"I'm on the game,
I ain't got no place to live,


631
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.558
"I'm addicted to crack...

632
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.917
"but I got some
wicked perfume on, boy".


633
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.310
Wasn't she the one who got shot?

634
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.233
What? Hm?

635
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.479
- The girl, I saw the poster, she...
- You don't wanna be saying that shit.


636
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.872
I swear. You know, in fact,
what are you still doing here, man?


637
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:27.313
What? You feel like a prick
'cause your pride's been dented?


638
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.311
You didn't think
it could happen to you!


639
00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.392
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
- Well, guess what, mate?


640
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.233
- It fucking did.
- Hmmmmm! Shut up!


641
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.597
You buying a gun to go
and shoot her new man


642
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.275
ain't gonna do jack, blud,
so, just move on, yeah?


643
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:46.115
You... can't... just... move... on!

644
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.114
You can! Your wife leaving you ain't shit
compared to what I've been through.


645
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.875
- I had a daughter with that woman!
- That's a better reason.


646
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.191
That's an even better reason
for you to not want this...


647
00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.558
this... this ugly ting in your life.
You got a little girl.


648
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:07.029
Yeah, well, that's just it,
isn't it? That's just it.


649
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.593
She isn't my little girl.
She isn't my little girl!


650
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.148
Now do you understand?!

651
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.668
Two years.

652
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:42.715
Two fucking years
I spent thinking I was her dad.


653
00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.678
And then I find out I'm not.

654
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.158
Two fucking years!

655
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.349
Some other fucker is.

656
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.272
Someone I know.

657
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.113
Ohh, I fucking know him.

658
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.159
I fucking know him!

659
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.673
And then my wife leaves me for him.

660
00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.632
Do you want to know how that feels?

661
00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.875
I'm her... it's my daughter.
She's not even mine.


662
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.471
Look...

663
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.114
I'm lying awake at night.

664
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.397
I'm going through my old diaries. I'm...

665
00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.270
I'm trying to figure out when it all began.
I'm going out of my fucking mind...


666
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.589
Ohhh, shit.

667
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.592
'Ere you are, man.

668
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.638
Rich man, 'ere you are.

669
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.638
Take it, blud. It's yours. Yeah?

670
00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.832
Look, I hear your beef and that.

671
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.516
I hear your beef, like, I understand.

672
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.353
But this gun ting, man.

673
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.432
It... it just ain't the way.

674
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.031
Bruv, you... you just gotta learn...
you gotta learn how to deal with this shit,


675
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:25.795
and move on. Yeah?

676
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.868
I moved on.

677
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.233
Never had no childhood.

678
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.551
I... I was in a children's home
since I was ten.


679
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.554
It was just me and my mum, blud.

680
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.713
Well, she obviously did a great job.

681
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.070
- I'm sorry.
- What did you just say?


682
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.312
- What did you say? Huh?
- I didn't mean it. I just...


683
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.234
- It just came out. I'm sorry.
- My mum did the best job she could!


684
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.393
The only reason I was in
the children's home was 'cause she died.


685
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.994
Think about how I felt.

686
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.118
Dumped in a children's home.

687
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.078
No dad. Dead mum.

688
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.356
Even at the age
of ten I was fucked!

689
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.911
That's why I'm here now!
That's why! 'Cause of my past!


690
01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.231
Look at y... You're the most
privileged person I've ever met!


691
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.994
- So, fuck you!
- Look, I didn't...


692
01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.991
No. No, no, no, no.

693
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.515
Fuck you! Fuck you!

694
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.236
If you lived my life, you'd be
the same crackhead as me!


695
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.872
If I lived your life, blud, if I knew
what I knew, I wouldn't be you.


696
01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.708
You fucking battie-boy crackhead!
You fucking prick!


697
01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.916
You're dead, blud!

698
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.956
What, blud? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do, bruv?


699
01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.908
Hey, you fucking prick, come here.

700
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.437
Yeah, I know. I know.

701
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.034
Ah, ah, ah, lower down.
Down there, man.


702
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.839
Hey, Paul. Watch where
you're putting your hands.


703
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.278
That's my woman you're feeling up.

704
01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.275
Can you feel it?

705
01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.880
Hey, come 'ere, you...

706
01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.032
Just allow it. 
Ray, man, just low it.

707
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.072
Hey, man, just get over it.

708
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.470
Gary, man, just allow it.

709
01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.596
Look, blud, blud, watch me.

710
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.796
Hold on, man. For fuck's sake.

711
01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.758
I got him. I got him, bruv.

712
01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.558
Shit.

713
01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.591
Come here, you little...

714
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.514
Wooooooh!

715
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.753
Best shit in town.

716
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.550
Hey, Gal, hurry up!

717
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.918
- I'm here, bruv.
- Man, hurry up! Get that door, man!


718
01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.799
- I'm coming.
- He's got nowhere to go, blud!


719
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.791
Fucking wanker!

720
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.349
Ray, he's blocked the door.

721
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.039
Ray!

722
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.353
You ain't got nowhere to go, blud!

723
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.760
What the fuck?

724
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.118
Guess he looks hard
with his shirt off though.


725
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.953
He looks great.

726
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.553
Look at that.

727
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.870
- Ready?
- Ready, yeah.


728
01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.434
You think you're funny, yeah?

729
01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.478
Ha-ha, look at him!

730
01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.758
Michael Jackson!
Whooo-ooooo!


731
01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.797
What you gonna do now, huh?

732
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.313
Prick.

733
01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.833
You got nowhere to go.

734
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.310
It's a long way down, innit?
I'm gonna toss you down there.


735
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.589
- No, blud. No, man!
- What you gonna do, bruv?


736
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.320
You're lucky I didn't bring my samurai.

737
01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.198
Look at that.

738
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.511
Get off him!

739
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.114
I said, get off him!

740
01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.636
- So... you... think... you... can... fuck...
- Ray, Gary!


741
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.997
Ray, Gary!

742
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.516
- I said get off!
- All right, low it, blud.


743
01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.510
Low it, yeah?

744
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.955
- We gotta go see the Hood.
- Fuck this.


745
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.669
Listen, I'm a little weed dealer
trying to pay my way through college.


746
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.196
- I ain't some fucking gyp.
- Oi, you'll chip it.


747
01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.713
Sef.

748
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.839
You're my bredren, man. Sef!

749
01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.398
Why the fuck did you do that?
I can't believe...


750
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.758
- What?
- You showed them the gun, man.


751
01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.435
- Man, this is all your fault, yeah?
- Why?


752
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.990
'Cause if you never came up to me
asking for a gun last night,


753
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.232
we wouldn't be in this shit.

754
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.789
Yeah!

755
01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.279
Fuck's sake, Michael.
The parrot ain't even in the window.


756
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.954
Got to go.

757
01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.070
Oh, easy, easy.
Put me down here, yeah.


758
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.832
Eh, eh, eh, easy. Oh, shit.

759
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.710
Ah, fuck. What the
fuck is wrong with you?

760
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.749
Fucking neck!

761
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.152
Fuck off.

762
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.750
What the fuck are you doing?

763
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.276
What does it look like I'm doing? Huh?

764
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.037
I'm looking for... a rock, all right?

765
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.398
I know, I swear, I know I lost a bit
of rock in here last night.


766
01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.716
Huh... Er, look, I really...

767
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.633
I don't think that's gonna solve anything.

768
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.793
Wh... what y... you talking about?
I need a toot, blud.


769
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.429
Don't you think you should leave?
I said don't you think you should leave?


770
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.431
You said he's going to come back.

771
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.398
Where the fuck am I meant to go?

772
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.519
Where am I going?
Where the fuck am I meant to go? Huh?


773
01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.875
Well, I just, er...

774
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.759
I don't know, somewhere. There must be...
must be somewhere you can go.


775
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.309
Don't get it, do you?

776
01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.552
You can move on 'cause you got cash.

777
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.752
No, it... it... 
It isn't just about money.

778
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.753
Yes, it is just about money, blud.

779
01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.558
What separates me and you?

780
01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.076
Poverty. Fucking poverty.

781
01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.919
Oh, shit. Paul.

782
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.479
There's a problem, man.

783
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.193
All right. OK. What if...
What if I said that I could get you money?


784
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.072
- Hm?
- What if I got you money?


785
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.674
Then do you reckon
you'd be able to leave?


786
01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.957
You said you couldn't
get me no more money.


787
01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:58.750
- Yeah. I know.
- Where you gonna get me money from?


788
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.234
With this.

789
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.678
I ain't doing no armed robberies.

790
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.513
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not talking about that.


791
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.194
So what are you saying?

792
01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.074
Why's he looking for the gun?

793
01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.994
Why's he want the gun
back so badly? Hm?


794
01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:32.357
Oh, come on. Come on.
I heard what he said to you.


795
01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.310
- What did he say?
- That this gun is a murder weapon.


796
01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.479
So?

797
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.428
So? What would happen
if the police got hold of it?


798
01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.876
I ain't handing it in to no Feds.

799
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.917
Just give me the gun back.

800
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.197
I'm not suggesting... I'm not
suggesting we hand it in.


801
01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.875
So what you saying then, man?

802
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.679
W... we got Hoodwink's gun, yeah?

803
01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.718
Wh... what do you want to do? Huh?

804
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.356
You want to sell him
his own gun back?


805
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.270
Horatio. Horatio.

806
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.432
You don't sell Hoodwink
his own gun, blud.


807
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.478
Huh, huh. Why not?

808
01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.312
'Cause you don't.

809
01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.074
- Why not?
- Ah, 'cause he's a killer.


810
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.076
Jesus fucking Christ!

811
01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.992
You...

812
01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.754
You motherfucker!

813
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.388
Motherfucker!

814
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.075
Hm... What's gonna stop him from...
from buying the gun off you


815
01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.356
and shooting you, blud?

816
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.149
- Well, I'll take the bullets out.
- What?


817
01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.719
I'll take the bullets out.

818
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.316
He only wants the gun.
He doesn't want the bullets.


819
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.519
Oh, shit.

820
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.470
Will you help me, for Christ's sake?!

821
01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.313
- I'm looking for my rock, man.
- Forget the crack.


822
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.952
- You're not going to find anything here.
- Shh. I got... bad man dementia.


823
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.429
That's not dementia, that's demented.

824
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.397
No. Demented, yeah?

825
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.678
Demented is you trying to sell a killer
back his own gun, blud. Yeah?


826
01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.118
This here is sensible, do you understand?

827
01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.319
Listen to me. Listen to me.
We have got to leave now!


828
01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.436
Yes.

829
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.392
Ahhh!

830
01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.952
I got it. Who's demented now?

831
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.277
Oi...

832
01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:15.151
"All of the yout' shall witness
the day Babylon shall fall. "


833
01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.878
Later, blud.

834
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.397
Fucking D! Motherfucker!

835
01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.791
You're fucking dead, you little prick!

836
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.919
Back up! Fucking back up!

837
01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.799
Don't be fucking stupid, gaybo.

838
01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.032
Back the fuck up!

839
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.995
Put the gun down. And get out.

840
01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.756
Get out. Just put the gun down
on the floor and get out.


841
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.309
'Cause I ain't got
no beef with you, gaybo.


842
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.150
No.

843
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.629
If you want the gun,
you're gonna have to pay for it.


844
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.634
I know why you
want this gun so badly.

845
01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.635
- What the fuck have you been saying?!
- So pay up.


846
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.635
Yeah. Yeah, the whole lot.

847
01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.189
Or I'm calling the police right now.

848
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.874
OK. OK. OK.

849
01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.149
Come and get it.

850
01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.673
You come and get my...

851
01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.600
.. fucking money.

852
01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.076
Go on.

853
01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.879
Go on.

854
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.999
You pick up
the fucking money, D, you're dead.


855
01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.276
I can't.

856
01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.237
Shit.

857
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.469
Oh... oh... oh...

858
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.034
Oh, gaybo.

859
01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.671
- Oi! Fucking get off him!
- You're dead, you fucker!


860
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.592
- Get off him!
- You're fucking dead...


861
01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.389
Get the fuck off him, man.

862
01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:15.077
Ah! Ah!

863
01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.471
Calm down, D. Calm down.

864
01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.269
Hey, lose the blade, man.

865
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.635
Lose the fucking blade!

866
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.833
- OK, OK!
- Go on!


867
01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.674
Come on, man. Look, I... I...

868
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.230
I know you were trying to pay me back.
I understand that.


869
01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.789
Please, D. Please.

870
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.520
Look at Tania. I'm... 
I'm just about...

871
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.719
just about to become a dad. Huh?

872
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.396
Please, D. Pl... 
D, don't do nothing stupid.

873
01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.633
Think. Think of the rocks
we could get, eh? You and me.


874
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.791
Huh?

875
01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.872
Eh, go round Crystal's, eh?

876
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.759
Get a nice half G stone.
Go back to my place.


877
01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.232
- Have a toot. Oh, it's beautiful.
- Stop it, man. Stop. Shut up. Shut up!


878
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.797
Nice pipe.

879
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.238
You know that... tight taste in your lungs.

880
01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.473
Beautiful, D.

881
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.871
Beautiful. Beautiful.

882
01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.476
Now shoot the gaybo.

883
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.833
Come on, D. Come on.

884
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.719
Shoot the fucking gaybo
and you are forgiven.


885
01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.359
No, D.

886
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.671
Come on, shoot the gaybo.
He... he... he knows too much.


887
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.796
He's gotta go. 
Shoot the gaybo, D.

888
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.916
Sh-sh-sh-shoot!

889
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.550
- Shoot him like you shot wee Briony.
- Please, D. please.


890
01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.711
I didn't shoot her.

891
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.314
Course you did.

892
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.755
No, no, no, no, no. No.

893
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.273
You shot her.

894
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.318
- Oh, come on, D...
- No, you shot her!


895
01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.836
D. We're a team. Huh?
You and me. D and Hoody. Huh?


896
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.230
Now, come on, shoot
the fucking gaybo!


897
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.995
That weren't part of it, blud!

898
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.958
It's not what you said to me.

899
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.238
Uh...

900
01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.868
For fuck's sake, D. Briony, she was...
she was threatening me, right?


901
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.918
She stole money off me,
she threatened to go to the Feds.


902
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.312
She was trying to blackmail me. I couldn't
have that, I've got a kid on the way.


903
01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.837
- So she had to go.
- What you talking about her like that, bruv?


904
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.959
My girl. That was my girl, yeah?

905
01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.793
- Hoods, I loved her.
- You loved her?


906
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.355
She was a wee crackhead whore.

907
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.273
And she sucked cock for rock.

908
01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.071
It's my fault, man.

909
01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.518
I coaxed her down into the basement.

910
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.916
And he was waiting there.

911
01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:47.750
I thought... I thought he was
just gonna scare her, man.


912
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.829
He fucking lost it.

913
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.435
He just went fucking mental, man.
He shot her.


914
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.755
Just shot her.

915
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.632
D? D.

916
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.432
We gotta go. We gotta go.

917
01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:32.229
No, Horatio.
No. No. No. You go, yeah?


918
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.992
You go.

919
01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.391
This ain't your world down here, blud.

920
01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.829
We got the money. We can leave.

921
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.356
Go where, blud?
Where the fuck can I go? Huh?


922
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.073
I've done bad, blud.
Don't you understand?!


923
01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.074
Just fuck off, yeah! I've gunned down
nuff people, you know, blud!


924
01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.677
- Fuck off, yeah?!
- OK, OK, OK, OK.


925
01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.230
OK. OK.

926
01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.595
OK.

927
01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.188
- I'll sort it.
- All right. I'm going. I'm going.


928
01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.113
Just go, man.

929
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.115
Come on, D,
you've gotta go too. Please.


930
01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.278
I can see her eyes, man.
When she was laying on the floor.


931
01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.400
And you know what
them eyes were saying?


932
01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.553
Thought me and you was tight, D.

933
01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.429
Me and you was tight.

934
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.877
I tried to help her, like.

935
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.072
She died, yeah?

936
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.152
She had the look in her eyes.

937
01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.508
She was saying, "Why, D?

938
01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.512
"Why? Why, D?"

939
01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.671
That's how I know, blud.

940
01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.479
Shooting someone ain't gonna
bring nothing but badness.


941
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.108
I keep telling you this.

942
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.748
Just fuck it off, man. 
Just forget it.

943
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.833
I wasn't going to shoot anybody.

944
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.589
I was gonna shoot myself.

945
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.356
Why, Horatio?

946
01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.799
You ain't done nothing wrong.

947
01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.713
Whereas... whereas I have.

948
01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:05.839
You... you still got
a chance to have a nice life, blud.


949
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.594
Whereas I don't.

950
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.754
Just... sort out your shit, yeah?

951
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.236
Please, Tom.

952
01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.793
Move on, yeah?

953
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.950
Move on, man.

954
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.631
We can all move on.

955
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.360
We can move on.

956
01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.795
Just move on.

957
01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:29.478
Breathe softly while you wait

958
01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.873
I won't be long

959
01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:48.449
I will stop the clock for you

960
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:57.873
When I get home

961
01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:07.514
When I get home

962
01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:21.815
Tenderness will pull you through

963
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:40.888
Lie gently while you wait

964
01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.950
I'll be there soon

965
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:58.733
I'll build a fire for you

966
01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:09.268
When I get home

967
01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:28.435
We will rest

968
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:38.414
And we will sleep

969
01:29:39.265 --> 01:29:45.224
