2
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.017
- Yes?
- It's Rolex.


3
00:01:21.142 --> 00:01:23.017
To see Papa Sanou.

4
00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:57.308
ONLY THE ANIMALS

5
00:02:50.683 --> 00:02:52.142
Hi there, you.

6
00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:55.058
Ah! You OK?

7
00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.225
What are you doing?

8
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.517
Nothing.

9
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.725
Forgot I was coming?

10
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.975
No.

11
00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:13.892
Let's look at this inside.

12
00:03:14.017 --> 00:03:15.392
Yeah.

13
00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:22.350
Here.

14
00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:23.850
OK...

15
00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.850
Check it over and sign.

16
00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:30.933
You need to get up to date
on hygiene monitoring.


17
00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:33.308
Did you fix a date?

18
00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:36.975
Not yet.

19
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.975
You have to.

20
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.600
Don't waste time.

21
00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:48.475
What?

22
00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:55.558
Remember what you said
the first day I came here?


23
00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:59.892
"I only talk to the animals
and my dog."


24
00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:05.142
It's true.

25
00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:06.767
Oh, yeah?

26
00:04:12.808 --> 00:04:14.642
I love your hands.

27
00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:25.183
I love it when you touch me.

28
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.850
Joseph...

29
00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.183
You weren't really with me today.

30
00:04:54.058 --> 00:04:55.767
The same anxieties?

31
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.433
Is that it?

32
00:04:58.558 --> 00:05:00.808
Have the noises come back?

33
00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:03.558
I need to be alone.

34
00:05:03.683 --> 00:05:05.392
I need to be alone.

35
00:05:05.517 --> 00:05:07.350
Don't say that.

36
00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:08.933
We do each other good.

37
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.433
You seem better to me anyhow.

38
00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:50.350
<i>This low-pressure zone
in place over central France</i>


39
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.642
<i>is bringing heavy snow...</i>

40
00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:55.225
Michel, are you eating with me?

41
00:05:57.058 --> 00:05:59.517
<i>
- I'm busy with the accounts.</i>
- OK.

42
00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:03.767
<i>Last night, a violent blizzard
struck the Causse plateau,</i>


43
00:06:03.892 --> 00:06:08.267
<i>leaving many homes
without power even now.</i>


44
00:06:08.392 --> 00:06:14.517
<i>For now, police efforts are focused
on a missing woman</i>


45
00:06:14.642 --> 00:06:18.767
<i>whose car was found abandoned
at the side of the road.</i>


46
00:06:18.892 --> 00:06:21.100
<i>So far, there are no leads.</i>

47
00:06:41.392 --> 00:06:42.558
Here.

48
00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:45.558
- It's ossobuco.
- Thanks.


49
00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:49.100
I had to draw on our joint account.

50
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:51.475
Mercier wanted a deposit for the shed.

51
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.683
Hadn't you already paid?

52
00:06:53.808 --> 00:06:55.600
No, that was the pump.

53
00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:59.142
A woman is missing.

54
00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:01.142
- Really? Where?
- On the plateau.


55
00:07:01.975 --> 00:07:03.267
I saw her car.

56
00:07:03.392 --> 00:07:04.892
Were you up there?

57
00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:07.183
Yes, for my rounds.

58
00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:12.350
I'll leave you.

59
00:07:26.892 --> 00:07:28.933
- Good evening, Dad.
- Hi.


60
00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.308
Ossobuco. Shall I warm it?

61
00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:34.767
All right.

62
00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:42.350
Is he managing?

63
00:07:42.975 --> 00:07:45.642
"He" has a name.
He's called Michel.


64
00:07:48.058 --> 00:07:49.933
- Your pills.
- Thanks.


65
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.892
Do you still fuck?

66
00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.350
Stop that, Dad.

67
00:07:57.475 --> 00:07:59.100
Meaning you don't.

68
00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.307
It's none of your business.

69
00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:07.808
No, you don't understand.
Let me explain.


70
00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:10.350
Mrs Calvet called the surgery

71
00:08:10.475 --> 00:08:15.392
to learn Mrs Lojewski is on sick leave,
with no replacement,


72
00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:17.975
and they don't know
when she'll be back.


73
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.808
- Is that right?
- Yes.


74
00:08:22.975 --> 00:08:28.058
No, don't see what you can do,
find someone to take over.


75
00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:31.100
All right.

76
00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:33.850
I'm counting on you. Call me.

77
00:08:33.975 --> 00:08:35.100
Thank you.

78
00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:36.600
Goodbye.

79
00:08:38.433 --> 00:08:39.683
Well...

80
00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:42.558
We'll manage it.
I won't back off.


81
00:08:42.683 --> 00:08:44.225
You're sweet.

82
00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:47.725
- It's good to be optimistic.
- Yes.


83
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.517
Necessary, I'd say.

84
00:08:52.558 --> 00:08:54.767
Do you love your husband?

85
00:08:58.642 --> 00:08:59.808
Yes, of course.

86
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.767
You're safe, then.

87
00:09:04.517 --> 00:09:06.183
That woman who's missing,

88
00:09:06.308 --> 00:09:08.517
she didn't love her husband

89
00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:10.808
and he didn't love her.

90
00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:13.600
When you love,

91
00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:16.017
nothing can happen to you.

92
00:09:16.808 --> 00:09:18.142
Nothing.

93
00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:23.933
<i>The search is complicated
by the amount of snow</i>


94
00:09:24.058 --> 00:09:26.183
<i>and the driving winds.</i>

95
00:09:26.308 --> 00:09:29.767
<i>There is no news yet
of the missing Parisian woman</i>


96
00:09:29.892 --> 00:09:32.183
<i>whose car was found abandoned.</i>

97
00:09:32.308 --> 00:09:34.933
<i>She has been named as Evelyne Ducat,</i>

98
00:09:35.058 --> 00:09:39.683
<i>who has a holiday home
in a renovated local sheep farm.</i>


99
00:09:39.808 --> 00:09:42.600
<i>Her husband, Guillaume Ducat,
was away when she disappeared.</i>


100
00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:45.017
<i>He was travelling abroad.</i>

101
00:09:45.142 --> 00:09:48.725
<i>He has just returned and gave us
this statement.</i>


102
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.683
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

103
00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:54.392
<i>Evelyne is independent,
but not rash.</i>


104
00:09:54.517 --> 00:09:58.308
<i>We don't always
tell each other everything we do.</i>


105
00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:01.267
<i>But it has been 48 hours,
and I'm starting to worry.</i>


106
00:10:05.892 --> 00:10:07.767
It's freezing out.

107
00:10:07.892 --> 00:10:09.850
- Is it a bad time?
- No.


108
00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:12.225
- Do you want a coffee?
- I wouldn't say no.


109
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.475
This weather's something else.

110
00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:23.600
- Here.
- Thank you.


111
00:10:23.725 --> 00:10:25.517
- It's hot.
- I've just made it.


112
00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:29.850
- You wanted something?
- Yes.


113
00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:34.017
Between you and me,
the Evelyne Ducat thing...


114
00:10:34.142 --> 00:10:35.975
- We're getting nowhere.
- Ah.


115
00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:40.392
If she were lost in the storm,
we'd have found her body.


116
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.392
What are you thinking?

117
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.725
You see a lot of people.

118
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.683
Maybe you heard things
that could help.


119
00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:55.558
Nothing precise. Rumours.

120
00:10:55.683 --> 00:10:57.017
Such as?

121
00:10:57.142 --> 00:10:59.725
Just senseless gossip.

122
00:11:01.808 --> 00:11:03.350
OK.

123
00:11:05.392 --> 00:11:06.767
Know Joseph Bonnefille?

124
00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:09.933
Yes.

125
00:11:10.058 --> 00:11:12.725
He's insured by us.

126
00:11:13.308 --> 00:11:16.267
I saw him earlier.
He's a bit of a loner.


127
00:11:17.017 --> 00:11:18.350
Do you know him well?

128
00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:20.892
Not that well.

129
00:11:21.017 --> 00:11:24.017
I've handled his file
for a few months.


130
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:27.642
Losing his mother shook him up.

131
00:11:28.308 --> 00:11:31.017
- Do you suspect him?
- No, no.


132
00:11:31.142 --> 00:11:32.558
I'm just curious.

133
00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:38.100
- OK?
- Hi.


134
00:11:39.808 --> 00:11:41.642
Just checking on you.

135
00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:45.475
I wondered if you two saw anything
during the storm.


136
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.975
We're still looking
for Guillaume Ducat's wife.


137
00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:50.475
I have no time for that.

138
00:11:53.142 --> 00:11:54.350
OK...

139
00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:57.808
I guess I'll be going.

140
00:11:57.933 --> 00:11:59.392
See you.

141
00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:00.642
Bye.

142
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.642
You have no time for it either.

143
00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:09.308
Why do you say that?

144
00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:11.392
Your round keeps you busy.

145
00:12:11.517 --> 00:12:13.392
What do you mean?

146
00:12:14.142 --> 00:12:16.392
Cheat on me all you like
with your dropout.


147
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.933
But don't come crying to me after.

148
00:12:37.558 --> 00:12:38.600
Joseph?

149
00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:47.183
Joseph?

150
00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:09.558
Joseph!

151
00:13:19.267 --> 00:13:20.767
Joseph?

152
00:13:44.808 --> 00:13:46.558
What are you after?

153
00:13:46.683 --> 00:13:48.392
You scared me.

154
00:13:51.058 --> 00:13:52.433
But...

155
00:13:52.558 --> 00:13:54.475
What happened to your dog?

156
00:13:55.183 --> 00:13:56.475
Someone shot him.

157
00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:58.475
Who?

158
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.933
No idea.

159
00:14:03.392 --> 00:14:04.725
Are you OK?

160
00:14:07.142 --> 00:14:08.475
Joseph?

161
00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:11.600
What's wrong?

162
00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:13.725
You can talk to me.

163
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.350
Why have you come?

164
00:14:17.892 --> 00:14:19.183
Because...

165
00:14:23.058 --> 00:14:24.475
I love you.

166
00:14:29.058 --> 00:14:30.600
I'm not interested.

167
00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:34.225
I don't believe you.

168
00:14:35.933 --> 00:14:37.392
What have you done?

169
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.433
Joseph, you can talk to me.
I can listen.


170
00:14:42.558 --> 00:14:44.058
Get out.

171
00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:46.100
Get the hell out!

172
00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:56.100
Don't cry.

173
00:14:59.808 --> 00:15:01.142
Don't cry.

174
00:15:25.183 --> 00:15:26.392
Hold on, I don't get it.

175
00:15:26.517 --> 00:15:28.308
<i>Will you press charges?</i>

176
00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:30.767
No, I won't press charges.

177
00:15:30.892 --> 00:15:32.225
Get off my back!

178
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.892
Who was that?

179
00:15:36.683 --> 00:15:38.850
Press charges against who?

180
00:15:41.017 --> 00:15:42.267
Michel...

181
00:15:42.392 --> 00:15:43.767
Talk to me.

182
00:15:45.017 --> 00:15:46.600
Michel...

183
00:16:42.766 --> 00:16:44.100
Michel.

184
00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:46.975
Come with me.

185
00:16:47.683 --> 00:16:48.933
Come inside.

186
00:16:51.725 --> 00:16:53.558
Did Joseph do this?

187
00:16:58.058 --> 00:16:59.642
Did you fight?

188
00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:04.433
Did you kill his dog?

189
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.975
Did you, Michel?

190
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.517
Alice!

191
00:17:25.975 --> 00:17:27.308
Alice!

192
00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:30.517
Alice!

193
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.600
Where's your husband?

194
00:17:35.725 --> 00:17:37.600
No idea. With the animals.

195
00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:40.975
The hell he is.
They haven't been fed.


196
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.308
He thinks life is a holiday?
I'll feed them.


197
00:17:44.433 --> 00:17:45.975
Goddamn layabout!

198
00:18:01.392 --> 00:18:03.642
Dad! Stop it!

199
00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:05.517
You can't exert yourself.

200
00:18:05.642 --> 00:18:07.225
Get off my back.

201
00:18:16.392 --> 00:18:18.683
Cédric, can you come here, please?

202
00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:29.350
I had an affair with Joseph.

203
00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:35.017
At first, I just wanted to help.

204
00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.267
I wanted to revive him.

205
00:18:40.225 --> 00:18:44.225
Give him gentleness
and pleasure.


206
00:18:45.767 --> 00:18:48.392
I didn't feel I
was in love with him.

207
00:18:50.975 --> 00:18:52.183
But you were.

208
00:18:53.517 --> 00:18:54.683
Yes.

209
00:19:00.517 --> 00:19:02.767
Michel killed Joseph's dog.

210
00:19:04.642 --> 00:19:06.225
They fought.

211
00:19:08.267 --> 00:19:09.767
It's my fault.

212
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.850
It's all my fault.

213
00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:15.475
That's Michel's car.

214
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.392
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


215
00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.433
Michel!

216
00:19:55.975 --> 00:19:57.600
Michel!

217
00:20:01.142 --> 00:20:02.975
Michel!

218
00:20:39.392 --> 00:20:40.725
What's wrong?

219
00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.058
What, boy?

220
00:22:08.767 --> 00:22:09.808
Shit...

221
00:22:47.142 --> 00:22:48.600
Hi there, you.

222
00:22:49.517 --> 00:22:51.267
Ah! Are you OK?

223
00:22:54.225 --> 00:22:55.600
What are you doing?

224
00:22:56.558 --> 00:22:57.850
Nothing.

225
00:23:01.267 --> 00:23:03.058
Did you forget I was coming?

226
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.933
Shit.

227
00:26:03.892 --> 00:26:05.558
What do you want from me?

228
00:27:24.475 --> 00:27:25.808
Hello.

229
00:27:26.975 --> 00:27:29.100
- Mr Bonnefille?
- Yes.


230
00:27:29.225 --> 00:27:30.975
Major Vigier, gendarmerie.

231
00:27:31.767 --> 00:27:33.975
Sorry, this won't take long.

232
00:27:35.225 --> 00:27:37.725
A woman has gone missing.

233
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.350
You must know her -
the wife of Guillaume Ducat, Evelyne Ducat.


234
00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:43.767
I don't know her.

235
00:27:44.808 --> 00:27:46.183
And her husband?

236
00:27:46.642 --> 00:27:47.642
Neither.

237
00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:52.058
She'd been here a few days.
Perhaps you saw her?


238
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.017
No.

239
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.767
All right.

240
00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:08.433
What's with your dog?

241
00:28:09.558 --> 00:28:10.558
He's hungry.

242
00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:13.642
I'm hungry, too,
but I don't bark like that.


243
00:28:18.683 --> 00:28:19.933
All right.

244
00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:23.142
I'll go now, Mr Bonnefille.

245
00:28:32.725 --> 00:28:33.933
Come here, boy.

246
00:28:34.058 --> 00:28:37.017
Listen to me.
You mustn't bark like that.


247
00:28:37.142 --> 00:28:38.642
Get it? Huh?

248
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.392
Get it?

249
00:28:40.517 --> 00:28:42.600
Go on, get in the house.

250
00:29:10.142 --> 00:29:11.725
They're looking for you.

251
00:29:29.892 --> 00:29:31.642
I'll stay with you.

252
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.058
I don't hear the noises here.

253
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.183
Thirty-four.

254
00:30:12.267 --> 00:30:14.142
News of the missing woman?

255
00:30:14.267 --> 00:30:16.308
Not that I know.

256
00:30:58.183 --> 00:31:00.100
Let go of her! Get away!

257
00:31:03.225 --> 00:31:04.767
Get away, I said!

258
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.642
Why did you do it?

259
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.142
Why did you do it?

260
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.642
<i>You're leaving</i>

261
00:31:52.725 --> 00:31:54.850
<i>No, my love, it's nothing</i>

262
00:31:54.975 --> 00:31:59.308
<i>Just a few weeks to wait</i>

263
00:32:01.183 --> 00:32:03.392
<i>You're leaving</i>

264
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.475
<i>My joys, my dreams are for you</i>

265
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.142
<i>There can be no doubt about that</i>

266
00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:17.267
<i>You're leaving</i>

267
00:32:17.392 --> 00:32:20.267
<i>Like a sun that vanishes</i>

268
00:32:20.392 --> 00:32:24.058
<i>Like a summer, like a Sunday</i>

269
00:32:25.308 --> 00:32:28.683
<i>I fear the winter and the cold</i>

270
00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:31.308
<i>I fear the emptiness</i>

271
00:32:31.433 --> 00:32:34.642
<i>The absence</i>

272
00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:39.850
<i>You're leaving</i>

273
00:32:39.975 --> 00:32:42.642
<i>And the birds aren't singing anymore</i>

274
00:32:42.767 --> 00:32:46.058
<i>The world is only indifference</i>

275
00:33:03.975 --> 00:33:05.767
You're the last one.

276
00:33:06.183 --> 00:33:07.433
Yes.

277
00:33:08.183 --> 00:33:09.767
They're all dead.

278
00:33:10.517 --> 00:33:11.517
Yes.

279
00:33:12.517 --> 00:33:13.975
Tell me about it.

280
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.933
Last summer,

281
00:33:22.933 --> 00:33:25.392
- when my mother died...
- Yes?


282
00:33:25.517 --> 00:33:27.933
I couldn't face calling anyone.

283
00:33:31.808 --> 00:33:33.808
You left her in her bed?

284
00:33:34.975 --> 00:33:36.142
Yes.

285
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.433
- For a long time?
- Yes, a long time.


286
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.517
Until she began to rot?

287
00:33:45.683 --> 00:33:47.892
Yes, until she began to rot.

288
00:33:50.267 --> 00:33:51.558
It doesn't matter.

289
00:34:03.933 --> 00:34:05.558
It doesn't matter a bit.

290
00:34:07.517 --> 00:34:09.017
Joseph!

291
00:34:36.892 --> 00:34:40.058
- What are you after?
- You scared me.


292
00:34:41.975 --> 00:34:43.350
But...

293
00:34:43.475 --> 00:34:45.392
What happened to your dog?

294
00:34:46.225 --> 00:34:47.892
Someone shot him.

295
00:35:12.392 --> 00:35:13.975
You can't stay here anymore.

296
00:37:27.058 --> 00:37:28.350
Goodbye.

297
00:37:28.475 --> 00:37:30.058
See you soon.

298
00:37:30.808 --> 00:37:32.142
Table 11.

299
00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:41.183
- Did you like it?
- Very much.


300
00:37:44.725 --> 00:37:46.058
I chose well, then.

301
00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:48.017
Yes.

302
00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:50.225
It was delicious.

303
00:39:04.183 --> 00:39:05.850
In Sète.

304
00:39:05.975 --> 00:39:07.725
I told you.

305
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.767
I don't know. A couple of days.

306
00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:14.058
Yes, I'll go to La Palière.

307
00:39:16.975 --> 00:39:18.350
All right.

308
00:39:19.517 --> 00:39:20.850
Me too.

309
00:39:28.808 --> 00:39:30.058
Who was it?

310
00:39:32.183 --> 00:39:34.933
You're a curious little monkey.

311
00:39:38.808 --> 00:39:41.475
- You won't tell me?
- My husband.


312
00:39:45.308 --> 00:39:47.017
Are you shocked?

313
00:39:47.142 --> 00:39:48.892
No, I'm not shocked.

314
00:39:52.808 --> 00:39:54.350
But it's a pity.

315
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:55.683
A pity for whom?

316
00:39:55.808 --> 00:39:57.642
For you or for me?

317
00:39:57.767 --> 00:39:59.183
For us.

318
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.933
Well, for everyone.
Even for him.


319
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.475
If it helps,
I don't think he cares.


320
00:40:14.267 --> 00:40:16.100
I love your kisses.

321
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:21.017
- A turnover, two swordfish.
- OK.


322
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.642
<i>Little monkey, I hate goodbyes.
Next time in Sète, I'll get dessert.</i>


323
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.433
Michel, what's wrong with you?

324
00:42:25.558 --> 00:42:27.100
Arsehole!

325
00:43:18.642 --> 00:43:19.975
Hi.

326
00:43:21.142 --> 00:43:22.433
Hello.

327
00:43:24.017 --> 00:43:25.142
How's it going?

328
00:43:26.017 --> 00:43:28.683
OK. How did you find me?

329
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.183
You mentioned this place.

330
00:43:32.933 --> 00:43:34.058
It's well hidden.

331
00:43:35.433 --> 00:43:37.642
That was the idea.

332
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.975
Is this a bad time?

333
00:43:42.475 --> 00:43:43.767
You're not alone?

334
00:43:44.933 --> 00:43:46.517
Actually, I am.

335
00:43:46.642 --> 00:43:48.558
I just wasn't expecting you.

336
00:43:56.683 --> 00:43:58.225
Put your bag down.

337
00:44:06.142 --> 00:44:07.933
I have a present for you.

338
00:44:20.308 --> 00:44:21.725
It's ugly.

339
00:44:22.392 --> 00:44:23.892
But nice.

340
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.392
Like me.

341
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.142
Who said you were nice?

342
00:44:51.975 --> 00:44:55.058
I feel we could live slotted together.

343
00:44:57.767 --> 00:44:59.267
Slotted together?

344
00:45:00.558 --> 00:45:02.517
Don't laugh, I'm serious.

345
00:45:04.975 --> 00:45:08.142
This kind of thing
only happens once in a lifetime.


346
00:45:15.475 --> 00:45:17.600
As soon as I
saw you, I felt it.

347
00:45:18.808 --> 00:45:20.433
I adore you.

348
00:45:23.183 --> 00:45:25.933
Don't talk to me
as if I was still a kid.


349
00:45:26.058 --> 00:45:28.475
- You are almost.
- No.


350
00:45:29.558 --> 00:45:30.642
Marion...

351
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.642
I'm twenty years older than you.

352
00:45:33.767 --> 00:45:35.517
Age doesn't matter.

353
00:45:35.642 --> 00:45:37.267
It does matter.

354
00:45:37.392 --> 00:45:38.767
It's in your mind.

355
00:45:38.892 --> 00:45:42.183
What's in your mind
is thinking it doesn't matter.


356
00:45:52.225 --> 00:45:53.517
Marion...

357
00:45:55.475 --> 00:45:56.642
What?

358
00:45:57.183 --> 00:45:59.225
I'd rather you didn't sleep here.

359
00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.267
It's Guillaume's house after all.

360
00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.308
Here.

361
00:46:30.433 --> 00:46:33.850
It's a bit basic,
but it's the only one open in winter.


362
00:46:35.975 --> 00:46:37.350
What are you doing?

363
00:46:37.475 --> 00:46:39.017
To pay for a room.

364
00:46:39.142 --> 00:46:40.433
Are you crazy?

365
00:46:40.558 --> 00:46:44.433
It's nothing. I feel guilty
for not letting you sleep over.


366
00:46:46.183 --> 00:46:48.183
So let's go back to yours.

367
00:46:48.808 --> 00:46:50.225
Go on, take it.

368
00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:53.308
I'd rather you feel guilty.

369
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.100
As you want.

370
00:47:04.058 --> 00:47:05.517
Can I help you?

371
00:47:07.225 --> 00:47:08.892
Do you have cheaper rooms?

372
00:47:09.017 --> 00:47:11.100
The prices are all there, Miss.

373
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.267
It's closed.

374
00:47:43.892 --> 00:47:45.892
Please, I'm cold.

375
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.100
This is all I can offer.
I can't open the trailers.


376
00:47:52.225 --> 00:47:53.558
It'll do.

377
00:47:57.308 --> 00:48:01.392
<i>I opted for the campsite.
I'd rather be with you!</i>


378
00:48:19.183 --> 00:48:21.017
Stop!

379
00:48:21.142 --> 00:48:22.600
What?

380
00:48:23.308 --> 00:48:25.058
Enough of this.

381
00:48:26.475 --> 00:48:27.933
I'm cold.

382
00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.767
I ache all over,
I slept badly.


383
00:48:31.892 --> 00:48:34.433
You should've taken the money.

384
00:48:34.558 --> 00:48:37.350
No, you should've
let me sleep at yours.


385
00:48:46.517 --> 00:48:49.225
Why own a dog
if you love being alone?


386
00:48:50.225 --> 00:48:52.808
I'm company for him.

387
00:48:52.933 --> 00:48:55.725
I didn't want a pet.

388
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:57.558
But he insisted.

389
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.183
He followed me on a beach
and never left.


390
00:49:05.517 --> 00:49:07.225
Adopt me.

391
00:49:11.767 --> 00:49:13.975
I'd like to keep things light.

392
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.350
You find me heavy?

393
00:49:17.392 --> 00:49:19.308
I find you irresistible,

394
00:49:19.433 --> 00:49:20.808
but a bit too...

395
00:49:21.267 --> 00:49:22.683
Too?

396
00:49:22.808 --> 00:49:24.725
I don't know... Too much.

397
00:49:25.767 --> 00:49:28.058
I have no idea
what "too much" means.


398
00:49:39.808 --> 00:49:40.892
Your husband?

399
00:49:41.683 --> 00:49:42.892
Yes.

400
00:49:44.058 --> 00:49:46.433
- I wish he'd die.
- Stop it.


401
00:49:47.683 --> 00:49:48.767
I'll curse him.

402
00:49:49.308 --> 00:49:50.392
He'll get sick.

403
00:49:50.517 --> 00:49:52.308
Stop it!

404
00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:44.683
<i>Yes?</i>

405
00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.767
There's someone outside.

406
00:50:46.892 --> 00:50:49.267
<i>What do you mean?</i>

407
00:50:49.392 --> 00:50:52.100
Someone peeping through the window.

408
00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:57.183
<i>You're imagining things.
Just go to sleep now.</i>


409
00:50:59.058 --> 00:51:00.433
I miss you.

410
00:51:01.683 --> 00:51:03.642
<i>I can't really talk now.</i>

411
00:51:04.308 --> 00:51:05.683
Come and fetch me.

412
00:51:07.475 --> 00:51:09.725
<i>Actually, Guillaume just got here.</i>

413
00:51:11.767 --> 00:51:13.558
<i>I can't see you now.</i>

414
00:51:17.767 --> 00:51:19.183
When does he leave?

415
00:51:19.892 --> 00:51:21.600
<i>I don't know exactly.</i>

416
00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:23.975
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

417
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.517
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

418
00:51:27.683 --> 00:51:29.100
<i>Good night.</i>

419
00:52:44.683 --> 00:52:48.725
Evelyne, stop it,
I don't want money, I want you!


420
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.933
Shit!

421
00:53:17.225 --> 00:53:19.308
Get back in the car!

422
00:53:19.433 --> 00:53:21.183
Fantomas, get back in!

423
00:53:43.767 --> 00:53:45.142
Come in.

424
00:53:52.683 --> 00:53:54.683
Here's my little caravan.

425
00:54:00.683 --> 00:54:02.392
Has your husband left?

426
00:54:02.517 --> 00:54:03.767
Yes.

427
00:54:04.558 --> 00:54:06.267
Actually, he wasn't here.

428
00:54:08.475 --> 00:54:09.517
What?

429
00:54:09.642 --> 00:54:11.475
I lied. He wasn't here.

430
00:54:13.933 --> 00:54:15.308
I don't understand.

431
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.308
I prefer to be alone.

432
00:54:19.933 --> 00:54:21.933
You prefer to be alone?

433
00:54:25.808 --> 00:54:27.850
We'll stop seeing each other.

434
00:54:29.683 --> 00:54:30.933
No.

435
00:54:31.058 --> 00:54:32.475
Certainly not.

436
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.183
Yes, you're young -
you have your whole life ahead of you.


437
00:54:35.308 --> 00:54:37.308
Stop it!
I want to be with you.


438
00:54:37.433 --> 00:54:40.517
- Let me speak.
- Don't try to fool me.


439
00:54:40.642 --> 00:54:42.142
Just let me speak!

440
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.558
I'm fond of you, Marion,
but I don't love you.


441
00:54:50.683 --> 00:54:51.725
Not true.

442
00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:56.392
It's not my fault.
I enjoy the sex, but it ends here.


443
00:54:56.517 --> 00:54:58.058
Stop it!

444
00:54:58.183 --> 00:55:00.933
I can't give what you want.

445
00:55:01.058 --> 00:55:03.600
- I want nothing.
- You want a lot. Listen...


446
00:55:03.725 --> 00:55:05.100
No, you listen.

447
00:55:05.225 --> 00:55:07.058
This is freaking you out.

448
00:55:07.183 --> 00:55:11.308
You don't prefer to be alone.
No one does. It's just...


449
00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:13.850
you're scared.

450
00:55:13.975 --> 00:55:15.683
You're scared of loving.

451
00:55:16.975 --> 00:55:19.058
And, above all, of being loved.

452
00:55:19.183 --> 00:55:21.392
But that's OK, I don't care.

453
00:55:21.517 --> 00:55:23.183
I love you enough for two.

454
00:55:23.308 --> 00:55:25.642
I can love you enough for ten.

455
00:55:25.767 --> 00:55:27.683
I'll give you everything.

456
00:55:27.808 --> 00:55:30.683
I'll make you happy.
Don't you want to be?


457
00:55:30.808 --> 00:55:32.183
Stop!

458
00:55:33.808 --> 00:55:34.892
Stop!

459
00:55:37.392 --> 00:55:39.683
Here's money for your trip home.

460
00:55:39.808 --> 00:55:42.350
Fuck you and your money!

461
00:55:42.475 --> 00:55:46.100
What do you think I am?
A whore?


462
00:55:46.225 --> 00:55:47.933
You disgust me!

463
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.142
You really disgust me.

464
00:57:25.767 --> 00:57:27.017
Miss?

465
00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.308
Miss?

466
00:57:35.933 --> 00:57:38.183
Miss? Can you hear me?

467
00:57:41.433 --> 00:57:42.850
Miss...

468
00:57:43.725 --> 00:57:45.392
Can you get up?

469
00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:53.475
Cédric Vigier, gendarmerie.

470
00:57:54.642 --> 00:57:56.142
Did you take something?

471
00:57:56.725 --> 00:57:58.767
Drugs? Pills?

472
00:58:02.267 --> 00:58:04.058
Look at me, please.

473
00:58:10.225 --> 00:58:12.850
I came to ask you
about Evelyne Ducat.


474
00:58:15.267 --> 00:58:16.392
She's missing.

475
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.183
When did you last see her?

476
00:58:34.433 --> 00:58:35.850
I forget...

477
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.892
The night of the storm.

478
00:58:38.017 --> 00:58:40.100
- Where?
- Here.


479
00:58:40.892 --> 00:58:42.558
She came to the campsite?

480
00:58:42.683 --> 00:58:43.892
Yes.

481
00:58:44.017 --> 00:58:45.100
And?

482
00:58:46.225 --> 00:58:47.600
We made love.

483
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:51.267
And after?

484
00:58:52.975 --> 00:58:54.600
After, she left.

485
00:58:55.517 --> 00:58:57.142
You left it at that?

486
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.892
How do you mean?

487
00:59:01.017 --> 00:59:03.142
Did you arrange to meet again?

488
00:59:03.267 --> 00:59:04.600
The next day, say.

489
00:59:05.392 --> 00:59:07.725
No, nothing was settled.

490
00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:10.308
You weren't worried
not to hear from her?


491
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.392
No, we were free.

492
00:59:19.808 --> 00:59:21.933
Why not say she left you?

493
00:59:26.392 --> 00:59:29.767
The janitor heard you arguing.
You hide away here...


494
00:59:30.683 --> 00:59:32.475
She ended it, right?

495
00:59:42.267 --> 00:59:44.392
What's all this money?

496
00:59:46.017 --> 00:59:48.392
She gave it to me to go away.

497
00:59:56.850 --> 00:59:58.433
What's happened to her?

498
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.308
Where is she?

499
01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:01.850
I don't know.

500
01:00:09.475 --> 01:00:10.808
Who is it?

501
01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:11.933
It's me.

502
01:00:12.808 --> 01:00:14.100
Who's me?

503
01:00:25.308 --> 01:00:27.267
I need you to explain.

504
01:00:29.558 --> 01:00:30.933
Who are you?

505
01:00:38.517 --> 01:00:40.725
The guy who called earlier...

506
01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:43.517
He wasn't a cop, it's a joke.

507
01:00:43.642 --> 01:00:45.642
I don't understand.

508
01:00:49.058 --> 01:00:50.350
Amandine...

509
01:00:51.392 --> 01:00:52.767
I don't understand.

510
01:00:53.725 --> 01:00:55.392
You're so beautiful.

511
01:00:59.017 --> 01:01:00.600
- Let go of me!
- It's me.


512
01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:02.267
Get lost!

513
01:01:07.017 --> 01:01:08.517
We'll go away together.

514
01:01:13.808 --> 01:01:15.642
- Amandine...
- Get lost!


515
01:01:15.767 --> 01:01:16.767
Amandine...

516
01:01:16.892 --> 01:01:18.392
Get the hell out!

517
01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.892
Get lost, bastard.
I don't want to see you!


518
01:01:22.767 --> 01:01:24.433
Get lost!

519
01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.725
Abidjan
-Paris!

520
01:01:46.892 --> 01:01:49.517
Hey, it's a small fish.

521
01:01:50.225 --> 01:01:52.142
You're taking too much.

522
01:01:52.267 --> 01:01:54.267
There's not enough atchéké.

523
01:01:54.392 --> 01:01:56.600
Leave some for others.

524
01:02:11.267 --> 01:02:13.392
Rolex! Rolex!

525
01:02:21.308 --> 01:02:23.183
He's made a lot.

526
01:02:25.517 --> 01:02:27.683
Don't you recognise him?

527
01:02:27.808 --> 01:02:29.683
He's Rolex the Bourgeois.

528
01:02:30.892 --> 01:02:33.767
He got a real pigeon.
He hit the jackpot.


529
01:02:33.892 --> 01:02:36.308
Even his sheep eats lettuce.

530
01:02:37.017 --> 01:02:39.767
It's true he's made a lot.

531
01:02:39.892 --> 01:02:42.725
But he did a bad thing.

532
01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.350
What did he do?

533
01:02:45.475 --> 01:02:47.683
A human sacrifice, a real zamou.

534
01:02:47.808 --> 01:02:48.933
What?

535
01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:51.683
- It's true.
- That's bullshit.


536
01:02:51.808 --> 01:02:53.683
You never believe me.

537
01:02:53.808 --> 01:02:57.058
But I don't lie.
Remember Navarro Big Bucks?


538
01:02:57.642 --> 01:02:59.558
He saw Papa Sanou, too.

539
01:02:59.683 --> 01:03:01.808
His pigeons coughed up big time.

540
01:03:01.933 --> 01:03:03.808
Where is he now?

541
01:03:03.933 --> 01:03:06.392
Dead and buried! Bad deal.

542
01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:12.142
Better rich for a day
than a slave all your life.


543
01:03:40.808 --> 01:03:42.933
Hey, thief, you scam from dawn?

544
01:03:43.058 --> 01:03:46.850
- I collect the colonial debt.
- Scam and come back broke.


545
01:03:46.975 --> 01:03:48.767
Get lost.

546
01:04:09.642 --> 01:04:11.142
That one.

547
01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:14.517
Beautiful and natural.

548
01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:16.058
True.

549
01:04:16.183 --> 01:04:18.225
Totally.
Her name's Angelina More.


550
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:21.767
Angelina More always wants more.

551
01:04:25.017 --> 01:04:27.475
- Got stuff?
- Photos, videos...


552
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.058
For a good price, as a buddy.

553
01:04:30.183 --> 01:04:33.933
With her, you'll hook rich fish
and earn loads of money.


554
01:04:49.017 --> 01:04:50.225
I'll take her.

555
01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:52.600
Your Angelina
will be my Amandine.


556
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.308
<i>Are you there?</i>

557
01:05:26.433 --> 01:05:27.558
<i>Yes.</i>

558
01:05:31.975 --> 01:05:32.975
<i>What are you doing?</i>

559
01:05:41.517 --> 01:05:42.975
<i>Seeing to my animals.</i>

560
01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:52.933
<i>I like that you work with animals.</i>

561
01:05:56.725 --> 01:05:59.017
<i>I love animals.</i>

562
01:06:06.267 --> 01:06:08.642
<i>It's a lot of work.</i>

563
01:06:16.225 --> 01:06:18.433
<i>Is Amandine your real name?</i>

564
01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.350
<i>Yes.</i>

565
01:06:21.517 --> 01:06:23.433
<i>I don't like lies.</i>

566
01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:28.558
<i>Neither do I.</i>

567
01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.558
<i>But Zorro's not your real name.</i>

568
01:06:37.517 --> 01:06:38.850
<i>No.</i>

569
01:06:48.017 --> 01:06:50.058
<i>What's your real name?</i>

570
01:06:51.183 --> 01:06:52.183
<i>Michel.</i>

571
01:06:56.975 --> 01:06:59.475
<i>Send me a photo of you?</i>

572
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.600
<i>All right.</i>

573
01:07:27.725 --> 01:07:29.642
<i>You're very pretty.</i>

574
01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:36.475
<i>That was at Christmas.</i>

575
01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.642
<i>Send me a photo of you?</i>

576
01:08:00.557 --> 01:08:03.642
You're a pretty pigeon, too.

577
01:08:35.892 --> 01:08:37.807
I'm here to see Papa Sanou.

578
01:08:42.517 --> 01:08:43.850
Wait here.

579
01:08:55.475 --> 01:08:56.682
Follow me.

580
01:09:07.392 --> 01:09:08.975
Sit down.

581
01:09:18.808 --> 01:09:20.017
Hello, Papa Sanou.

582
01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:23.600
I want to hook a pigeon,

583
01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:25.808
get lucky and make lots of money.

584
01:09:25.933 --> 01:09:27.350
I know.

585
01:09:30.725 --> 01:09:32.183
The photo.

586
01:09:42.975 --> 01:09:45.308
You have a photo of the bait?

587
01:09:52.142 --> 01:09:55.183
You're lucky. She's beautiful.

588
01:09:55.308 --> 01:09:56.767
It's not luck.

589
01:09:56.892 --> 01:10:00.058
I chose her well,
bought photos, videos...


590
01:10:00.183 --> 01:10:01.975
- It's chance.
- Not even.


591
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.517
Shut up!

592
01:10:05.517 --> 01:10:07.058
What do you know of spirits?

593
01:10:08.892 --> 01:10:10.933
Chance is stronger than you, idiot!

594
01:10:14.558 --> 01:10:16.142
What's her name?

595
01:10:17.058 --> 01:10:18.975
For my pigeon, Amandine.

596
01:10:20.058 --> 01:10:21.517
Amandine.

597
01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:25.433
Do you know what love is?

598
01:10:27.142 --> 01:10:28.808
- Yes.
- No.


599
01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:30.183
You don't know.

600
01:10:31.475 --> 01:10:34.517
Love is giving what you don't have.

601
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:37.225
- You understand?
- Yes.


602
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:38.808
Giving what you have

603
01:10:38.933 --> 01:10:40.808
means having fun.

604
01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:44.100
Love is giving what you don't have.

605
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.392
Repeat.

606
01:10:47.433 --> 01:10:49.642
Love is giving what you don't have.

607
01:10:50.308 --> 01:10:52.850
Are you ready to give
what you don't have?


608
01:11:05.517 --> 01:11:07.142
Fill your mouth.

609
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.392
Go on, fill it.

610
01:11:23.933 --> 01:11:25.558
Spit on the photos.

611
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:34.808
Your white man wants you.

612
01:11:36.142 --> 01:11:38.433
He needs all your love.

613
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:40.892
Yes.

614
01:11:41.017 --> 01:11:43.642
What you ask, he'll give you.

615
01:11:44.642 --> 01:11:46.725
And your fortune will grow.

616
01:11:48.058 --> 01:11:49.433
Thank you, Papa Sanou.

617
01:11:50.933 --> 01:11:52.850
You'll thank me later.

618
01:11:53.558 --> 01:11:55.642
Listen to me carefully.

619
01:11:55.767 --> 01:11:58.100
When your white man coughs up,

620
01:11:58.225 --> 01:12:00.975
come back to give the spirits
their share.


621
01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:02.975
You understand?

622
01:12:04.433 --> 01:12:06.433
Yes, I understand.

623
01:12:12.558 --> 01:12:15.267
<i>How are you, sweetheart?</i>

624
01:12:15.392 --> 01:12:16.517
<i>Not great.</i>

625
01:12:22.517 --> 01:12:24.058
<i>Why?</i>

626
01:12:25.183 --> 01:12:26.017
<i>My dad has died.</i>

627
01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:35.933
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

628
01:12:40.767 --> 01:12:43.017
<i>He worked in Abidjan.
He had a heart attack.</i>


629
01:12:43.142 --> 01:12:44.642
<i>I must go there.</i>

630
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.225
<i>When do you go?</i>

631
01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.142
I don't know.

632
01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:02.892
<i>I have no money for the flight.</i>

633
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.183
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

634
01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.433
<i>I cry all the time.</i>

635
01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.100
<i>How much do you need?</i>

636
01:13:27.225 --> 01:13:28.558
A bite!

637
01:13:29.767 --> 01:13:31.183
I got a bite!

638
01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:43.058
Is 1,000 euros good?

639
01:13:44.517 --> 01:13:46.850
<i>Almost 1,000 euros.</i>

640
01:13:55.308 --> 01:13:57.933
<i>The bank won't give me a loan.</i>

641
01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:09.100
<i>The bank won't give me a loan.</i>

642
01:14:27.808 --> 01:14:29.058
<i>I can help if you want.</i>

643
01:14:29.183 --> 01:14:30.933
It's working!

644
01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.183
It's working.

645
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.517
<i>Pay me back later.</i>

646
01:14:42.892 --> 01:14:45.808
<i>You're too kind.</i>

647
01:14:45.933 --> 01:14:47.850
Too, too kind.

648
01:14:53.642 --> 01:14:56.017
<i>I'm happy to help.</i>

649
01:14:57.892 --> 01:14:59.767
Darling,

650
01:14:59.892 --> 01:15:01.767
as a way to thank you,

651
01:15:01.892 --> 01:15:04.392
I'm going to send you something.

652
01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.100
A little video.

653
01:15:14.308 --> 01:15:16.433
He'll be wanking all night.

654
01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:22.475
Hi there.

655
01:16:15.433 --> 01:16:17.225
I'm going to Mende tomorrow.

656
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:18.767
OK.

657
01:16:29.933 --> 01:16:31.225
Excuse me.

658
01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.392
- Do you sell PCS coupons?
- Yes.


659
01:16:35.517 --> 01:16:37.058
I need 1,000 euros worth.

660
01:16:57.558 --> 01:16:59.183
Money, money...

661
01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.683
I've never seen so much money.

662
01:17:12.808 --> 01:17:14.683
The General!

663
01:17:14.808 --> 01:17:18.350
Check out the General's style!

664
01:17:18.475 --> 01:17:20.475
Smart dressers, too!

665
01:17:23.433 --> 01:17:24.850
Everyone feeling good?

666
01:17:27.308 --> 01:17:28.767
Everyone?

667
01:17:31.017 --> 01:17:32.642
Hello and welcome

668
01:17:32.767 --> 01:17:35.392
to Abidjan’s most exclusive party!

669
01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:38.725
Tonight's sponsor is General CFA,

670
01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:41.392
the most generous of generals.

671
01:17:41.517 --> 01:17:43.183
General CFA!

672
01:17:43.308 --> 01:17:44.808
Mr Prestige in person!

673
01:17:45.308 --> 01:17:47.017
Check his look.

674
01:17:47.142 --> 01:17:48.767
Check his pants.

675
01:17:48.892 --> 01:17:50.433
Yes, General.

676
01:17:50.558 --> 01:17:51.892
He's going to stand.

677
01:17:52.017 --> 01:17:53.600
General CFA!

678
01:17:54.142 --> 01:17:56.683
Check his moves!

679
01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:00.475
Hey! Cut, cut, cut!

680
01:18:01.933 --> 01:18:03.225
Here's the cut!

681
01:18:04.642 --> 01:18:06.267
He's going to town!

682
01:18:06.392 --> 01:18:09.392
CFA! General CFA.

683
01:18:09.517 --> 01:18:11.600
The man for whom the CFA
has no secrets.


684
01:18:11.725 --> 01:18:13.225
General CFA!

685
01:18:14.225 --> 01:18:15.892
Show your stuff!

686
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.308
The cash dispenser!

687
01:18:23.475 --> 01:18:26.433
The money! The moves! The moment!

688
01:18:31.767 --> 01:18:33.517
Hands in the air!

689
01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:34.892
Praise the guy!

690
01:18:35.017 --> 01:18:36.475
Mr NMW.

691
01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.683
No Money Worries!

692
01:18:38.808 --> 01:18:40.142
General CFA!

693
01:18:41.892 --> 01:18:44.767
The fan! The fan...!

694
01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.517
CFA storm!

695
01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:52.017
Money storm!

696
01:19:04.017 --> 01:19:05.433
It's Monique.

697
01:19:05.558 --> 01:19:07.517
- What?
- Monique, look.


698
01:19:18.642 --> 01:19:20.600
She's even more beautiful.

699
01:19:20.725 --> 01:19:22.183
Go and see her.

700
01:19:25.183 --> 01:19:26.267
Go on.

701
01:19:26.392 --> 01:19:27.850
Get up!

702
01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:31.642
The General.

703
01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:40.808
Monique.

704
01:19:44.433 --> 01:19:45.642
Monique.

705
01:19:51.725 --> 01:19:53.183
It's been ages.

706
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:56.433
It's been ages.

707
01:20:32.808 --> 01:20:34.225
Is this your place?

708
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:35.475
Yes.

709
01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.933
You won the lottery or what?

710
01:20:50.767 --> 01:20:53.975
Stop staring.
You look like a fish.


711
01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.183
Seriously, tell me.

712
01:20:58.517 --> 01:21:01.558
He's French.
He invested in mining.


713
01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:05.475
- A French guy?
- Yes.


714
01:21:06.142 --> 01:21:08.267
He's OK, he leaves me in peace.

715
01:21:08.392 --> 01:21:11.017
I just have to be with him
when he comes on business.


716
01:21:13.308 --> 01:21:14.433
And Flore?

717
01:21:15.392 --> 01:21:16.975
He's kind to her.

718
01:21:18.558 --> 01:21:20.017
Can I see her?

719
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.725
You can look at her,
but don't wake her.


720
01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:29.017
OK.

721
01:21:42.433 --> 01:21:43.892
She's very pretty.

722
01:21:45.225 --> 01:21:46.683
She's my treasure.

723
01:21:49.975 --> 01:21:51.933
I think she has my nose.

724
01:21:52.058 --> 01:21:54.725
No. I hope not.

725
01:22:45.142 --> 01:22:46.392
Come on.

726
01:22:48.892 --> 01:22:50.475
<i>Can I tell you a secret?</i>

727
01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.100
Yes...

728
01:22:52.892 --> 01:22:55.392
of course, my love.

729
01:23:05.017 --> 01:23:08.017
<i>I've put money aside</i>

730
01:23:12.183 --> 01:23:14.683
<i>for years, to go away one day.</i>

731
01:23:15.392 --> 01:23:17.558
Your wife says nothing?

732
01:23:22.683 --> 01:23:26.142
<i>She doesn't know.</i>

733
01:23:27.767 --> 01:23:29.558
She doesn't know...

734
01:23:32.683 --> 01:23:34.517
You don't love her.

735
01:23:37.808 --> 01:23:40.017
<i>You don't love her anymore?</i>

736
01:23:42.892 --> 01:23:44.267
<i>It's you I love.</i>

737
01:23:44.392 --> 01:23:46.308
Oh, my darling!

738
01:23:56.183 --> 01:23:57.642
<i>I want your touch.</i>

739
01:24:02.183 --> 01:24:04.017
<i>All over. My breasts. My bum.</i>

740
01:24:04.142 --> 01:24:05.350
<i>You like my breasts?</i>

741
01:24:08.517 --> 01:24:09.600
<i>Yes.</i>

742
01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:15.808
And my bum?

743
01:24:20.183 --> 01:24:21.475
<i>Yes.</i>

744
01:24:22.517 --> 01:24:24.100
Want to fuck it?

745
01:24:28.892 --> 01:24:30.642
<i>Yes.</i>

746
01:24:34.017 --> 01:24:35.142
<i>Say it.</i>

747
01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:41.725
Go on, say it.

748
01:24:42.725 --> 01:24:44.058
I want to fuck it.

749
01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.725
Coming to eat?

750
01:24:47.725 --> 01:24:49.683
Not yet, I'm on the accounts.

751
01:24:51.225 --> 01:24:52.850
I'll bring your meal?

752
01:24:53.475 --> 01:24:54.933
Later.

753
01:25:25.683 --> 01:25:27.433
I have a gift for you, too.

754
01:25:29.142 --> 01:25:30.475
Close your eyes.

755
01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:41.267
OK. Open them now.

756
01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:46.808
You're crazy.

757
01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:50.100
Look, there's a diamond.

758
01:25:50.642 --> 01:25:51.892
A real one.

759
01:25:52.017 --> 01:25:54.975
It's beautiful.
It must've cost a fortune.


760
01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.767
Yes.

761
01:25:56.892 --> 01:25:59.267
All I've ever made.
All of it.


762
01:25:59.392 --> 01:26:01.392
I didn't even throw a party.

763
01:26:05.017 --> 01:26:07.267
- Armand...
- Yes?


764
01:26:09.725 --> 01:26:13.433
I won't leave my white guy,
not for you or anyone.


765
01:26:16.975 --> 01:26:19.975
Don't go imagining things.

766
01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:22.058
I'm imagining nothing.

767
01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.975
I'll offer you more than him.

768
01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.892
A big house,

769
01:26:27.017 --> 01:26:28.892
the best schools for Flore.

770
01:26:30.808 --> 01:26:33.267
I'll prove it, trust me.

771
01:26:38.558 --> 01:26:40.308
<i>They beat me. They stole my money
and my debit card.</i>


772
01:26:49.725 --> 01:26:53.600
<i>Come back to France.
You can't stay there.</i>


773
01:26:59.850 --> 01:27:02.475
<i>Come and see me.</i>

774
01:27:04.892 --> 01:27:06.517
<i>At your place?</i>

775
01:27:07.892 --> 01:27:09.183
<i>Yes.</i>

776
01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.808
<i>I'll send you money.</i>

777
01:27:21.142 --> 01:27:23.017
Thank you, darling.

778
01:27:30.475 --> 01:27:31.933
I love you.

779
01:27:33.975 --> 01:27:35.017
I'll be waiting.

780
01:27:55.558 --> 01:27:57.017
<i>Chance is greater than you.</i>

781
01:28:06.558 --> 01:28:08.475
What did they say?

782
01:28:09.767 --> 01:28:11.350
It's pressure.

783
01:28:11.475 --> 01:28:12.808
I'm not surprised.

784
01:28:12.933 --> 01:28:14.600
You're stressed.

785
01:28:16.683 --> 01:28:19.267
It's not stress,
it's my blood pressure.


786
01:28:20.392 --> 01:28:22.350
You can be calm
and have high pressure.


787
01:28:22.475 --> 01:28:24.142
It's the heart.

788
01:28:24.267 --> 01:28:26.600
The heart and nerves
are all linked.


789
01:28:28.225 --> 01:28:29.517
It's true.

790
01:28:31.892 --> 01:28:34.433
Look...
We can pick her up.


791
01:28:59.850 --> 01:29:02.225
Michel, what's wrong with you?

792
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:03.808
Nothing.

793
01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.850
Are you crazy?

794
01:29:07.808 --> 01:29:09.267
The poor thing.

795
01:29:11.392 --> 01:29:12.683
Honestly...

796
01:29:12.808 --> 01:29:14.892
- It's OK.
- That's so mean.


797
01:29:51.433 --> 01:29:52.892
<i>I saw you.</i>

798
01:29:54.392 --> 01:29:56.017
<i>You came here.</i>

799
01:29:59.725 --> 01:30:02.725
I couldn't stop.
I was with my wife.


800
01:30:07.558 --> 01:30:09.558
What does he mean?

801
01:30:09.683 --> 01:30:11.475
<i>It was a shock seeing you.</i>

802
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.558
Your guy's nuts.

803
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:18.433
He believes so much in your love,
he sees Amandine for real.


804
01:30:18.892 --> 01:30:20.933
<i>It was you, wasn't it?</i>

805
01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:23.267
What do I tell him?

806
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:25.225
It's screwed.

807
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:26.683
Just say goodbye.

808
01:30:26.808 --> 01:30:28.850
No. I'm not saying goodbye.

809
01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:35.683
<i>Yes, it was me.</i>

810
01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:40.558
<i>Where are you?</i>

811
01:30:40.683 --> 01:30:43.683
<i>At the hotel?</i>

812
01:30:43.808 --> 01:30:47.475
I don't know where she is!
How can I know?


813
01:30:49.433 --> 01:30:50.975
<i>I want to see you.</i>

814
01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.267
No, be patient.

815
01:30:56.558 --> 01:30:58.933
<i>Not yet. You must be patient.</i>

816
01:31:00.058 --> 01:31:02.475
<i>I'll explain.</i>

817
01:31:05.725 --> 01:31:07.308
<i>I love you.</i>

818
01:31:13.808 --> 01:31:16.767
How'll you get him
to send you money now?


819
01:31:17.558 --> 01:31:19.517
Your luck is gone, bro.

820
01:31:29.433 --> 01:31:31.100
Speak.

821
01:31:31.933 --> 01:31:33.433
It's the zamou.

822
01:31:34.475 --> 01:31:36.350
Luck has abandoned me.

823
01:31:36.475 --> 01:31:37.850
I've lost the zamou.

824
01:31:38.892 --> 01:31:41.100
Something's blocking it?

825
01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:42.850
Yes.

826
01:31:42.975 --> 01:31:45.017
- And you know why.
- Yes.


827
01:31:45.142 --> 01:31:46.142
Say it.

828
01:31:49.642 --> 01:31:51.183
I forgot to come back.

829
01:31:52.142 --> 01:31:53.933
You forgot to come back.

830
01:31:54.808 --> 01:31:56.850
-Yes.
- Because you earned so well.


831
01:31:56.975 --> 01:31:58.600
Yes.

832
01:31:58.725 --> 01:32:00.225
You spent it all.

833
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:02.017
And you forgot the spirits.

834
01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:03.892
Yes.

835
01:32:04.017 --> 01:32:05.558
Ask for forgiveness.

836
01:32:05.683 --> 01:32:08.267
- Forgive me.
- On your knees!


837
01:32:10.142 --> 01:32:11.808
Forgive me, Papa Sanou.

838
01:32:21.975 --> 01:32:23.392
It'll be 4,000 euros.

839
01:32:23.975 --> 01:32:25.850
What? 4,000 euros?

840
01:32:33.808 --> 01:32:36.142
<i>I have to confess something.</i>

841
01:32:41.433 --> 01:32:45.600
<i>I saw you in town and followed you.</i>

842
01:32:50.433 --> 01:32:51.767
<i>I know you're at the campsite.</i>

843
01:32:56.017 --> 01:32:59.017
<i>I scared you.
It was me watching you.</i>


844
01:32:59.142 --> 01:33:00.517
<i>You're so pretty.</i>

845
01:33:03.642 --> 01:33:05.100
<i>Did you find the money?</i>

846
01:33:18.517 --> 01:33:24.267
<i>The 500 euros in the envelope.</i>

847
01:33:28.683 --> 01:33:30.225
<i>Did you find it?</i>

848
01:33:35.058 --> 01:33:36.350
<i>Yes.</i>

849
01:33:46.183 --> 01:33:47.933
<i>But I need much more.</i>

850
01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.475
<i>Why?</i>

851
01:33:57.558 --> 01:34:02.892
<i>There are people I owe money to.</i>

852
01:34:07.683 --> 01:34:09.933
How much do you owe them?

853
01:34:10.767 --> 01:34:12.142
<i>How much?</i>

854
01:34:16.308 --> 01:34:17.767
4,000 euros?

855
01:34:27.933 --> 01:34:29.850
<i>I need coupons, not envelopes.</i>

856
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:35.017
I want to see you first.

857
01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.933
<i>That's too dangerous.
They're serious.</i>


858
01:34:46.308 --> 01:34:48.058
I don't care.

859
01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:49.558
Too bad.

860
01:34:50.517 --> 01:34:51.517
I want to see you.

861
01:35:18.725 --> 01:35:19.892
Stop!

862
01:35:20.892 --> 01:35:22.558
Stop!

863
01:35:25.392 --> 01:35:28.017
Fuck you and your money!

864
01:35:28.142 --> 01:35:29.933
What do you think I am?

865
01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:31.808
A whore?

866
01:35:31.933 --> 01:35:33.308
You disgust me!

867
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:36.892
You really disgust me.

868
01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.642
What's wrong?

869
01:37:16.767 --> 01:37:18.225
You like making others suffer?

870
01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:22.517
What? Who are you?

871
01:37:23.725 --> 01:37:25.183
I'm nobody.

872
01:37:26.433 --> 01:37:28.808
I'm calling the police.

873
01:38:47.058 --> 01:38:48.558
Deal with that.

874
01:38:53.017 --> 01:38:55.392
He's working hard.
He's focused.


875
01:38:57.475 --> 01:38:58.558
Look at his face.

876
01:38:58.683 --> 01:39:00.892
He's an ugly bastard.

877
01:39:03.058 --> 01:39:04.683
Look at his eyes.

878
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:06.642
Like roadkill.

879
01:39:16.392 --> 01:39:18.308
<i>- Are you there, sweetheart?
- Yes.</i>


880
01:39:18.433 --> 01:39:19.642
<i>Don't worry.</i>

881
01:39:23.058 --> 01:39:24.642
<i>I have solved your problem.</i>

882
01:39:33.183 --> 01:39:35.683
<i>That woman won't threaten you again.</i>

883
01:39:37.433 --> 01:39:39.017
<i>We can be together now.</i>

884
01:40:20.225 --> 01:40:23.225
<i>We can be together now.</i>

885
01:40:24.558 --> 01:40:26.058
Are you Amandine?

886
01:40:28.475 --> 01:40:30.642
Answer.
Are you Amandine?


887
01:40:32.058 --> 01:40:33.058
Yes.

888
01:40:33.183 --> 01:40:34.683
Well?

889
01:40:34.808 --> 01:40:37.725
Didn't your parents teach you
to make an honest living?


890
01:40:38.892 --> 01:40:40.017
They did.

891
01:40:40.142 --> 01:40:41.392
So why do this?

892
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:46.017
The guys you scam,

893
01:40:46.142 --> 01:40:49.058
do they deserve
to have their feelings mocked?


894
01:40:50.892 --> 01:40:52.308
No.

895
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.892
We'll call your victim.

896
01:41:06.933 --> 01:41:08.933
<i>
- Hello?</i>
- Mr Michel Farange?

897
01:41:09.642 --> 01:41:10.975
<i>Yes.</i>

898
01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:15.142
This is Inspector Siako,
with the Abidjan cybercrime unit.


899
01:41:15.267 --> 01:41:16.433
<i>Yes?</i>

900
01:41:16.558 --> 01:41:17.975
Mr Farange,

901
01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:22.017
have you been in touch
with an Amandine lately?


902
01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.725
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

903
01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:25.475
The girl doesn't exist.

904
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.517
<i>I have the young scammer here.</i>

905
01:41:27.642 --> 01:41:29.058
<i>His name's Armand.</i>

906
01:41:29.183 --> 01:41:31.308
I don't understand.

907
01:41:31.433 --> 01:41:32.808
<i>Mr Farange,</i>

908
01:41:33.683 --> 01:41:35.600
<i>will you press charges?</i>

909
01:41:35.725 --> 01:41:38.517
No, I won't press charges.
Get off my back!


910
01:41:39.475 --> 01:41:41.100
Who was that?

911
01:41:44.517 --> 01:41:46.475
Press charges against who?

912
01:41:48.933 --> 01:41:50.183
Michel...

913
01:41:50.308 --> 01:41:51.767
Talk to me.

914
01:41:52.933 --> 01:41:54.350
Michel.

915
01:42:23.517 --> 01:42:24.850
Who is it?

916
01:42:25.683 --> 01:42:26.850
It's me.

917
01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:29.892
Who's me?

918
01:42:38.017 --> 01:42:39.975
I need you to explain.

919
01:42:41.183 --> 01:42:43.267
- Get lost!
- Amandine...


920
01:42:43.392 --> 01:42:45.017
Get lost!

921
01:42:45.725 --> 01:42:48.600
Get lost, bastard.
I don't want to see you!


922
01:42:49.517 --> 01:42:50.892
Get lost!

923
01:43:07.767 --> 01:43:09.683
Did Joseph do this?

924
01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:15.725
Did you fight?

925
01:43:18.767 --> 01:43:20.725
Did you kill his dog?

926
01:43:23.850 --> 01:43:25.100
Did you, Michel?

927
01:45:04.308 --> 01:45:05.808
Michel!

928
01:45:08.017 --> 01:45:09.892
Michel!

929
01:45:11.225 --> 01:45:12.683
Michel!

930
01:46:05.558 --> 01:46:07.225
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.


931
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:09.017
- I'm looking for Armand.
- Who?


932
01:46:09.142 --> 01:46:10.267
- Armand.
- Armand?


933
01:46:10.392 --> 01:46:12.600
- Armand.
- There's no Armand here.


934
01:46:14.225 --> 01:46:16.517
I told you,
there's no Armand here.


935
01:46:16.642 --> 01:46:17.642
Armand?

936
01:46:17.767 --> 01:46:19.808
Let people work.
There's no Armand here.


937
01:46:19.933 --> 01:46:20.933
Armand?

938
01:46:21.058 --> 01:46:24.308
There's no Armand.
Let people work, please.


939
01:46:34.142 --> 01:46:36.475
- 109, please.
- Here you are, Monsieur.


940
01:47:02.433 --> 01:47:05.017
Armand! Armand!

941
01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:15.100
- Hello, Armand.
- Hello, Monique.


942
01:47:15.225 --> 01:47:19.058
I was looking for you.
Your sister said you worked nearby.


943
01:47:19.183 --> 01:47:20.767
I'm helping my uncle.

944
01:47:22.642 --> 01:47:23.975
That's good.

945
01:47:24.767 --> 01:47:26.767
I came to say goodbye.

946
01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:29.850
You're leaving?

947
01:47:31.267 --> 01:47:34.183
Flore and I are
going to live in France.

948
01:47:37.392 --> 01:47:39.683
I wanted to give this back.

949
01:47:43.433 --> 01:47:44.475
Take it.

950
01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.725
Sell it.
I know you're in trouble.


951
01:47:48.767 --> 01:47:50.475
I'm not in trouble.

952
01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.350
Keep it.
I chose it for you.


953
01:48:02.225 --> 01:48:03.683
Take good care of Flore.

954
01:48:35.058 --> 01:48:36.142
Hey.

955
01:48:36.267 --> 01:48:38.267
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, I did.


956
01:48:38.392 --> 01:48:40.892
Haven't seen you in a while.

957
01:48:42.308 --> 01:48:44.808
- That's why you called?
- Yes.


958
01:48:46.558 --> 01:48:48.017
- I'll get to work.
- You work?


959
01:48:48.142 --> 01:48:49.558
- Yes.
- Stay cool.


960
01:49:00.225 --> 01:49:01.600
He's outside.

961
01:49:05.225 --> 01:49:07.142
The guy in the grey T-shirt.

962
01:49:07.267 --> 01:49:09.808
- Which one?
- The grey T-shirt.


963
01:49:09.933 --> 01:49:11.183
You see him?

964
01:50:10.517 --> 01:50:11.850
Recognise me?

965
01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.267
You had a good laugh.

966
01:50:16.392 --> 01:50:18.933
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did!


967
01:50:19.058 --> 01:50:20.392
I didn't.

968
01:50:21.767 --> 01:50:23.308
I'll pay you back.

969
01:50:23.433 --> 01:50:25.767
I don't give a shit about the money!
Understand?


970
01:50:25.892 --> 01:50:26.933
Screw the money!

971
01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.933
<i>Are you there?</i>

972
01:52:00.017 --> 01:52:02.975
<i>Yes, my love.</i>

973
01:53:23.095 --> 01:53:28.095
