00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.140
<i>Was it sunny that day?</i>

2
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.960
<i>Was it raining?</i>

3
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.720
<i>My memory is as
fuzzy as the weather.</i>


4
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.170
What? But...

5
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.950
<i>But in that moment...</i>

6
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.080
<i>my heart was filled with blue sky.</i>

7
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.180

8
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.060
Good morning.
You're finally up.


9
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.360
Curry?

10
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.150
Oh, it's recyclable trash day.

11
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.110
Miyu, can you take it out?

12
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.820
What? No way.

13
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.330
Come on, help me out a little.

14
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.290
<i>Especially in the Kanto region,</i>

15
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.520
<i>there is a possibility of strong
rain with localized thunderstorms...</i>


16
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.140
Rain again?

17
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.390
Hurry up and eat it.
Because it won't clean itself up.


18
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.720
Bread would've been better.

19
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.600
It would be a waste. So eat it.

20
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.520
<i>Later in the evening, as cold air
moves south, it will get even colder.</i>


21
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.600
- You're not gonna eat it?
- I don't want it


22
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.550
Hey.

23
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.070
Oh... Miyu!

24
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.200
Geez...

25
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.580
<i>Why won't it keep
together on rainy days?</i>


26
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.110
Miyu.

27
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.750
Your umbrella. Okay.

28
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.620
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah.


29
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.050
Thank you. Have a nice day.

30
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.020
Good morning.

31
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.850
Good morning. Thank you.

32
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.440
Have a nice day.

33
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.730
Whoa, are you okay?

34
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.880
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

35
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.120
It's so embarrassing! Stop it!

36
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.240
<i>Curry in the morning, and weather
forecast says it will rain all the time.</i>


37
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.920
I'm so unlucky.

38
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.750
Wow, so cold!

39
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.180
Good morning.

40
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.340
Good morning, Sakiko.

41
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.640
Miyu.

42
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.670
Miyu?

43
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.870
Huh?

44
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.230
You okay?

45
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.400
Huh? Why?

46
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.140
Ah... I was wondering
if you had studied for the test.


47
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280
Test?

48
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.740
Fourth period,
English test, remember?


49
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.910
Do we have one today?

50
00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.540
Ah!

51
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.260
I forgot I'm on class duty, too.

52
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.710
Sorry, I'm going ahead.

53
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.340
Okay.

54
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.420
Here, take this.

55
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.420
Later!

56
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.230
Morning, Yuto.

57
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.650
What's with the mask?

58
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.630
Hey.

59
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.030
What's going on with you two?

60
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.630
Huh? With who?

61
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.120
With Shuya.

62
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.990
What's going on...

63
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.830
Nothing.

64
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.460
Nothing... aren't you guys dating?

65
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.420
I don't know.

66
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.800
What are you saying?

67
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.220
You know, don't you? The rumors.

68
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.230
Are you guys even talking at all?
If you won't tell me, I'll just...


69
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.140
You're so nosy.

70
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.860
Miyu.

71
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.830
Thanks.

72
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.040
But I'm totally fine.

73
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.590
<i>I'm the worst...</i>

74
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.810
Go for it! Go, go!

75
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.810
Yeah!

76
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.020
Nice one! Thank you!

77
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.320
Okay, I'll hand them out.

78
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.570
What...

79
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.820
Ah! Ah!

80
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.240
Score less than 50, and you'll stay
after school to turn in your homework.


81
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.200
What!?

82
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.740
Be quiet. Be quiet.

83
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.160
Okay, put your textbooks away.

84
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.000
Write upper case and
lower case letters clearly.


85
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.930
Shuya, you can do it!

86
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.020
What are you daydreaming about?

87
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.710
Sorry...

88
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.650
Here.

89
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.570
Oh, my God.
Sorry, sorry.


90
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.490
Sorry, sorry.
Thank you.


91
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.830
Shuya, you can do it!
One more!


92
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.030
I heard growling during the test.

93
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.490
Thanks for this.

94
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.380
Did you get it?

95
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.620
I got detention.

96
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.540
What?! Today's the first.
You got a date, remember?


97
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.000
Watch the movie
and tell him what I think...


98
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.710
It's not a date,
it's just a movie night.


99
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.260
Miyu...

100
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.720
I mean, what's the point of
only going to the movies on the first


101
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.510
when we can go anytime
with a student discount?


102
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.020
Why don't you just tell him
you want to see him more?


103
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.850
I'm not trying to say that...

104
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.400
Okay, okay.
You're not being honest, Miyu.


105
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.030
Ah... I'm starving.

106
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.740
But it's not that easy
dating someone for two years.


107
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.700
Yes.

108
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.410
I don't know if I'd call it dating...

109
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.210
Miyu, are you still
bothered by the rumors?


110
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.900
Not at all!

111
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.990
Come on, let's eat!
I'm so hungry.


112
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.490
Lunch!

113
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.640
- Look.
- Huh?


114
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.130
Whoa. You didn't put
your lunch box the right way.


115
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.630
But it looks delicious.

116
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.000
Where?

117
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.180
Well, because everything's handmade.

118
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.230
Egg rolls, can I?

119
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.340
It's yours.

120
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.150
- What? Are you sure?
- Yeah.


121
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.750
Yay!

122
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.200
Mmm... Delicious!

123
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.760
You're exaggerating.

124
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.950
I'll take one!

125
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.160
- It's really good!
- Right!


126
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.910
It's really good.

127
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.000
He's here.

128
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.580
You should go.

129
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.580
Yeah.

130
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.310
I'll be right back.

131
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.150
<i>W
-What?</i>

132
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.650
Miyu...

133
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.670
Your hair's a mess.

134
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.670
You overslept?

135
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.960
It won't keep it together on rainy days.

136
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.710
So?

137
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.430
- What is it?
- "What is it?"...


138
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.180
You can go to the
movie today, right?


139
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.580
I'm free today...

140
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.980
What the heck...
It's like I'm inviting you just to kill time.


141
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.400
See you after school.

142
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.840
- Okay.
- Okay.


143
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.200
Do you know what today is?

144
00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:58.660
Movie Day?

145
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.710
Yuto's answer was that
it was my Dad's birthday.


146
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.130
I was thinking of
going to the movies.


147
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.480
With who?

148
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.800
Huh?

149
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.220
The movie...

150
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.520
who are you going with?

151
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.270
I haven't decided yet.

152
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.650
Let's go together.
I was thinking of going too.


153
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.230
- What?
- What are you watching?


154
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.690
- Ah...
- Oh, wait.


155
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.950
Let's say it together.

156
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.910
So, if it's the same movie
we want to see... let's watch it.


157
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.500
What do you think?

158
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.670
Yeah.

159
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.890
Okay.

160
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.030
Okay.

161
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.470
Ready?

162
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.020
- One, two...
- One, two...


163
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.440
"I Want to Eat Your Pancreas".

164
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.230
Why?

165
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.960
You two really are a perfect match.

166
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.440
Why don't you two just go out?

167
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.690
What?

168
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200
Then...

169
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.000
let's go out?

170
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.950
What...

171
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.630
Congrats, man!

172
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.630
- Way to go, Shuya!
- Congrats!


173
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.090
- Let's take a pic.
- I like that!


174
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.280
Say cheese.

175
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.660
Is it really okay?

176
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.100
Okay, thank you.

177
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.230
See you tomorrow.

178
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.770
Are you done?

179
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.110
Are you okay?

180
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.870
You never got detention before, right?

181
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.990
Okay!

182
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.030
Well, don't be a regular like this guy.

183
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.080
Yes.

184
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.500
What the heck..

185
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:42.340
- Hey, don't write this in katakana.
- No, no, I didn't.


186
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.780
- Be careful on your way home. Don't detour.
- I won't.


187
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.120
- See you.
- Yes. Bye.


188
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.290
Movie...

189
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.030
you're not going?

190
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.460
I'm going.

191
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.460
I really...

192
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.500
don't get you guys.

193
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.430
I don't even know myself.

194
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.560
- See ya.
- Okay.


195
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.400
Oh, sorry. I'll go on ahead.

196
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.580
- Okay, bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow. Take care.


197
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.940
Miyu!

198
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.370
Hey.

199
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.960
Let's go.

200
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.000
Yeah.

201
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.870
- That's good, right?
- That looks good, right?


202
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.430
- You made a mistake.
- We did?


203
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.310
Hello?

204
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.150
Oh, excuse me for a bit.

205
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.720
Hello?

206
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:14.610
Really?

207
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.240
Okay.

208
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.500
I'll be on my way.

209
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.290
Thank you.

210
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.710
Sorry, Miyu.

211
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.880
Something urgent came up, so...

212
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.220
I can't watch the movie.

213
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.160
I'm really sorry.

214
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.140
Urgent?

215
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.100
Just a little...

216
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.610
What the...

217
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.910
Sorry. Next week, I promise!

218
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.570
Sorry.

219
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:05.830
Miyu?

220
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.960
Okay.

221
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.760
No, it's completely alright.

222
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.890
I'm sorry.

223
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.150
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.920
Go on.

225
00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.120
Eat.

226
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.790
Shuya, clear weather suits you.

227
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.550
Huh?

228
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.150
You're like the blue sky.

229
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.950
What?

230
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.460
Miyu.

231
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.880
Huh?

232
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.670
I promise.

233
00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.470
First day of every month,
we'll absolutely go to the movies together.


234
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.840
Absolutely?

235
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.970
Yeah, even if we have a fight.

236
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:46.820
Huh?

237
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.020
No matter what happens.

238
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.940
Okay.

239
00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.230
I promise.

240
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.950
Okay.

241
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.000
Let's come here again.

242
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.170
<i>"Starting Tomorrow, My Love For
Her Will Be Rainy" will start soon...</i>


243
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.460
<i>I shouldn't have made that promise.</i>

244
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.840
<i>[ I want to talk to you again.
I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower. ]</i>


245
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.600
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.350
Miyu!

247
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.400
- Listen to me!
- Enough.


248
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.730
I'm not mad.

249
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.860
If you want to play
with other girls, go ahead.


250
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.490
It's not my business.

251
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.520
What...

252
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.790
I wish...

253
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.380
you would just disappear.

254
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.900
Miyu!

255
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.300
Huh?

256
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.560
A dream?

257
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.400
Good morning. You're finally up.

258
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.280
Why curry again?

259
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.240
Why? Because yesterday's
leftovers would go to waste.


260
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>Here is the national weather forecast.</i>

261
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.630
It's recyclable trash day.
Miyu, can you take it out?


262
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.160
What?

263
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.110
Help me out once in a while.

264
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.920
<i>Low pressure will bring
rain in the evening.</i>


265
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.870
<i>Especially in the Kanto region,</i>

266
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.740
<i>there is a possibility of strong
rain with localized thunderstorms,</i>


267
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.840
<i>so please take precautions.</i>

268
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.420
<i>When you go out,
even if it's not raining,</i>

269
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.350
<i>don't forget to bring an umbrella.</i>

270
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.960
Mom, is today the 1st?

271
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.460
That's why it's recyclable trash.

272
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.770
<i>Later in the evening, as cold air
moves south, it will get even colder.</i>


273
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.280
You're not gonna eat it?

274
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.240
I'm good!

275
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.120
Hey!

276
00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.120
Miyu?

277
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.500
Geez...

278
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.340
Good morning. Thank you.

279
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.050
Have a nice day.

280
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.440
Good morning. Thank you.

281
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.560
Good morning. Thank you.

282
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.890
Have a nice day.

283
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.480
- Whoa, are you okay?
- I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.


284
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.940
Ah, it's okay.

285
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.610
It's so embarrassing! Stop it!

286
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.240
Wow, so cold!

287
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.580
What is this? Déjà vu?

288
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.630
Good morning.

289
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.350
- Oh, Sakiko.
- What's wrong?


290
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.130
Shuya's safe, right?

291
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:16.390
Huh?

292
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.010
No! It's nothing.

293
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.770
Right. Did you study for the test?

294
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.020
Test... English, right?

295
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.570
Here, I'll lend you this.

296
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:42.540
Miyu?

297
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.710
Oh, sorry, I'm going ahead.

298
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.540
What?

299
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.950
What's wrong with her?

300
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.220
Beats me...

301
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.470
<i>The number you are calling may
not be on, or out of coverage area...</i>


302
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.120
Miyu?

303
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:25.950
Shuya.

304
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.500
How unusual of you to
come to my classroom.


305
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.710
You're alive...

306
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:34.630
What?

307
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.010
Hey! Why won't you answer your phone?

308
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.140
Oh, it's out of juice.

309
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.560
Do you have a charger?

310
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.180
Of course not.

311
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.520
You don't...

312
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.190
I do.

313
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.690
Ah, Tomoka.

314
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.740
I'll lend it to you.

315
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.630
- Here.
- Thanks.


316
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:13.840
As expected of Tomoka.

317
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.340
Well, yeah...

318
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.840
- What's the matter?
- What?


319
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.310
I forgot my world history textbook...

320
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.100
World history...

321
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.150
Oh, sorry, we don't have one today.

322
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:33.730
Oh.

323
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.150
That's okay. No problem.

324
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.190
Really?

325
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.280
I have mine.

326
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.650
Hey, hey, you left it again?

327
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.370
Maybe I should stop lending it to you.

328
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.260
I'm sorry. Can you lend it to her?

329
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.620
Wait there.

330
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.790
Are you okay?

331
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.740
Yeah.

332
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.880
Here.

333
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.260
Thank you... very much.

334
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.050
Yeah.

335
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.350
Okay, Shuya, treat me
to something next time!


336
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.220
No way!

337
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.660
- It's okay.
- Shuya, you buying?


338
00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.890
No, I'll return it.

339
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.560
- I'm good.
- It's okay.


340
00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.650
It's okay. It's okay.

341
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.410
World history?
We don't have one today.


342
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:30.330
I know.

343
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.080
Okay, I'll hand them out.

344
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.430
Ah! Ah!

345
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.680
Score less than 50, and you'll stay
after school to turn in your homework.


346
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.630
Be quiet. Be quiet.

347
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.510
Put your textbooks away.

348
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.830
Write upper case and lower case letters...

349
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:52.640
<i>It goes in.</i>

350
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.080
What are you daydreaming about?

351
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:03.740
Here.

352
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.060
It will fly.

353
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.120
Oh, my God.

354
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.250
Sorry, sorry.
Thank you.


355
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.540
Thank you.

356
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.420
<i>Is the same day repeating itself?</i>

357
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.740
Here.

358
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.710
<i>Why can't I remember this one?</i>

359
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.620
I heard growling during the test.

360
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.760
How did you do?
Did you get it?


361
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.480
I got detention.

362
00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.090
What?! Today's the first.
You got a date, remember?


363
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.630
Sakiko, will you listen to me?

364
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.790
What?

365
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:13.350
I think this is the second
time I've spent this day.


366
00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.190
Huh?

367
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.810
Yesterday was November 1,

368
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.510
and when I woke up this morning,
it was November 1 again!


369
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:23.860
What?

370
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.740
What's going on?

371
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.030
It's true!

372
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.320
If we go to the movies today,
something bad will happen.


373
00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.880
Is it a prophetic dream thing?

374
00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:37.620
Yeah.

375
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.960
I heard that prophetic dreams
are all subconscious.


376
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.800
I've heard that it's a
manifestation of your desires.


377
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.550
Desire?

378
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.550
Yes. What did you dream about?

379
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.050
Shuya...

380
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.900
will be punished.

381
00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.320
Miyu.

382
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.730
You really do care!
About the rumors.


383
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.260
No! That's not it!

384
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.780
Yes, yes, you're right.

385
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.640
Rumor is rumor.
Best not to worry about it.


386
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.000
<i>It's uneven.</i>

387
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.220
You didn't put it straight
in your bag, didn't you?


388
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.180
But it looks delicious.

389
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.770
Want some?

390
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.900
<i>Sakiko chooses the egg rolls.</i>

391
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.680
Are you sure?

392
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.810
- Yeah.
- Then, I won't hesitate!


393
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.400
<i>I knew it.</i>

394
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.740
Delicious!

395
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.780
I'll take one!

396
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.570
- It's really good!
- It's really good!


397
00:30:59.040 --> 00:30:59.910
You...

398
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.750
know what I'm gonna say.

399
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.040
She knows what you'll say.

400
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.380
- She knows.
- She knows.


401
00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.560
It's good, right?

402
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.090
<i>I knew it. It is the same.</i>

403
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.560
Miyu...

404
00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.430
<i>Here it comes.</i>

405
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.120
What?

406
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.320
Nothing.

407
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.470
Your hair's a mess.

408
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.410
I told you that it won't
keep it together on rainy days.


409
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.160
So?

410
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.030
What is it?

411
00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:40.620
"What is it?"...

412
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.070
You can go to the
movie today, right?


413
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.520
<i>We went to the movies, and Shuya...</i>

414
00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.380
Sorry.

415
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.930
I can't go today.

416
00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.890
I got detention.

417
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.190
I'll wait.

418
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.620
I don't know when it will be.

419
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.630
It's okay, no problem.

420
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.840
<i>Stubborn.</i>

421
00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.310
I've got things to do.

422
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.510
Things to do?

423
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.220
Things to do at home.

424
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.990
For how long?

425
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.860
Anyway!

426
00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.700
I can't today.

427
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.500
Sorry.

428
00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.670
Okay.

429
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.700
Bye.

430
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.360
See you tomorrow.

431
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.280
You'll go straight home today, right?

432
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.080
- Here!
- Are you done?


433
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.290
Are you okay?

434
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.750
Yes.

435
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.170
What?

436
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.380
Oh, okay...

437
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.510
Okay, okay, okay!

438
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.940
- Detention regular.
- Hello!


439
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.550
- Starting tomorrow, okay?
- Yes, sir.


440
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.560
- Don't detour, just go home.
- Yes, sir.


441

- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.


442

I really don't get you guys.

Wow, I want to watch this next month.

457
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:40.880
- Which one?
- This one, this one.


458
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:43.050
A sci-fi, "Concluder".

Oh...

460

What about you?
Anything you want to watch?

Hold this, hold this,

I'm okay with this.

Thank goodness...

490

Oh? Shuya's not with you?

Yeah.

495
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.480
Did something happen?

496
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.190
What about the movie?

497
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.030
Today's the first, right?

498
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.080
There it is, Yuto's meddling.

499
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.360
What the hell is he doing?

500
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.330
Today I told him I can't go.

501
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840
Why?

502
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.920
A lot of things happened.

503
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.180
Are you okay?

504
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.770
I'm okay.

505
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:44.480
Are you?

506
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:48.230
Your nosiness is hard-core, isn't it

507
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.280
I'm not being nosy.

508
00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.700
I don't like it when you cry.

509
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.560
- Thanks for the surprise.
- Not at all.


510
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.790
It's great that everyone was there.

511
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.460
I'm glad.

512
00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.400
Everyone had a great time, didn't they?

513
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:18.640
Shuya...

514
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.480
Don't go.

515
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.120
I...

516
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.540
I like you.

517
00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.380
Sorry, I have to go!

518
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.850
Shuya!

519
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.310
Shuya!

520
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.010
Hey! Hey, you there!

521
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.430
Are you okay?

522
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.640
Are you okay?
Can you answer me?


523
00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:00.450
Shuya... Why?

524
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.980
I'm back.

525
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.530
<i>It's not a dream.
It's definitely repeating itself.</i>


526
00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.270
Ah, Shuya!

527
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:53.670
<i>The number you are calling
may not be on or out of coverage...</i>


528
00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:10.720
Miyu?

529
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.280
Good morning.

530
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:14.720
Aren't you late for today?

531
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.650
I was waiting for you, Shuya.

532
00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.430
What?

533
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.030
I can't call your phone.

534
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.830
It must be low battery.

535
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:30.840
Yes.

536
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.470
- What's wrong?
- What?


537
00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.630
Ah... nothing.

538
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.560
You don't have a fever.

539
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.270
You okay?
You're spacing out.


540
00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:57.640
That startled me...

541
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:10.740
Huh?

542
00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:15.750
I thought I hadn't
seen it in a while.

543
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.560
Huh?

544
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.500
Your smile.

545
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.590
What are you talking about?

546
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.090
Well, because...

547
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.070
recently you're kind of moody
and not feeling well.


548
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.310
Because of...

549
00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:37.980
the rain!

550
00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:40.690
I prefer you that way.

551
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.440
I prefer you smiling.

552
00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.500
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

553
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.800
<i>A desire?</i>

554
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:05.130
<i>No.</i>

555
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.300
You can go today, right?
To the movies.


556
00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.010
Yeah.

557
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.390
Okay.

558
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:13.140
<i>I want to save Shuya.</i>

559
00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:16.980
Shuya.

560
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.670
Yeah?

561
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.690
Can we leave early today?

562
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.270
Okay.

563
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.540
I'll go buy some.

564
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.420
- Whoa!
- Whoops.


565
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:43.820
What the heck...

566
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.300
You're late.

567
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:51.350
<i>I like you.</i>

568
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.790
Ah, yeah...

569
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:07.990
Are you okay?

570
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.740
Yeah, I'm okay.

571
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.670
If you forget a
period, you lose a point.

572
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.830
Here.

573
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.220
You're motivated, aren't you?

574
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.000
I am!

575
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.510
Did you get it?

576
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.760
Perfect!

577
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.520
Here, an egg roll!

578
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.160
Here.

579
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.190
Thank you.

580
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.110
- It's really good!
- It's really good!


581
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.710
Miyu?

582
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.380
Thanks for the textbook the other day.

583
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:12.140
What?

584
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.510
Huh?

585
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.850
Oh... it's nothing.

586
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.770
Shuya was here a while ago...

587
00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:23.690
Movie?

588
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:25.440
Huh?

589
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:27.620
Shuya told me

590
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.900
that the first of every
month is movie day.


591
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:33.700
Yes.

592
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.530
That's nice.

593
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.750
But isn't it lonely if
that's all there is?


594
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.380
If I were you,
I'd want to see him more.


595
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.380
Take better care of him.

596
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.080
- Even I...
- Ow, ow, ow!


597
00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:58.860
Ah, Shuya.

598
00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.630
Oh, Miyu!

599
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:07.190
Wait here a bit.

600
00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.070
Okay.

601
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:09.340
See ya...

602
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.260
Hey, Shuya.

603
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.680
I have a favor to ask.

604
00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.340
Huh?

605
00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.300
Turn off your phone.

606
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:42.480
What? Now? Isn't it better
when the movie starts?


607
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.160
I need you to turn it off now.

608
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:45.750
What's the matter?

609
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.110
Please.

610
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.900
Just for today, listen to me.

611
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:54.490
Okay.

612
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.150
Is that okay?

613
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.550
- Thank you.
- Okay.


614
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:06.790
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

615
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.290
<i>I can save him for sure today.</i>

616
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:13.460
<i>"Starting Tomorrow,
My Love For Her Will Be Rainy"</i>


617
00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.720
<i>will be starting soon.</i>

618
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.460
Let's go.

619
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:17.520
Shuya.

620
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:21.320
Tomoka?

621
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.420
<i>Why is she here?</i>

622
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.670
I finally found you.

623
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.890
I can't get a
hold of you at all.

624
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.440
Oh, sorry.

625
00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.440
Can we talk for a bit?

626
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.940
Okay.

627
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:32.820
Wait here.

628
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.370
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll go ahead.


629
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.260
Miyu, I'm sorry.

630
00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.180
Can we do the movie next week?

631
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:05.220
Did something happen?

632
00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.100
It's an emergency...

633
00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:11.060
I'm really sorry.

634
00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:16.860
You promised you'd
listen to me today,


635
00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.530
didn't you?

636
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.700
I'm sorry.

637
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:22.740
Don't go.

638
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.870
- Miyu.
- Please!


639
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:28.590
Sorry.

640
00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.010
If you insist on going...

641
00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.220
then let's break up.

642
00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:47.980
What?

643
00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.630
You're choosing her, aren't you?

644
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.400
- What are you saying?
- I'm serious.


645
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.320
My last request.

646
00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:00.360
After today, you and I can break up.

647
00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:03.320
So, just for today...

648
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.030
Please.

649
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:07.950
Miyu.

650
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.500
Are you really thinking that?

651
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:13.040
What?

652
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:17.590
You can decide if it's
the last time or breaking up.


653
00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:19.440
If you have something to say, say it!

654
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:23.640
Shuya, don't just hide and sneak around,

655
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.010
speak up!
- What about you, Miyu?


656
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:31.480
You've never once told
me how you really feel.


657
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:43.910
I'm going.

658
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.210
Huh?

659
00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:42.140
Hello?

660
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.390
<i>Hello? It's me.</i>

661
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.470
<i>You forgot your lunch box, didn't you?</i>

662
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:49.560
Oh, yeah...

663
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.660
<i>I forgot.</i>

664
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.320
Oh, and I don't mean to be nosy,

665
00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:01.980
<i>but I asked Shuya
about the rumors with Tomoka.</i>


666
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:06.550
He said they were just part-timers.

667
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.410
What?

668
00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.620
<i>That guy must be
working part-time too.</i>


669
00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:12.490
<i>So...</i>

670
00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.210
don't worry about it anymore.

671
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:17.660
<i>Bye.</i>

672
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:34.240
<i>[ I want to talk to you again.
I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower. ]</i>


673
00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.800
Shuya!

674
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.170
Shuya!

675
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.380
Shuya!

676
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.160
Shuya!

677
00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:39.400
Shuya!

678
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.550
Shuya!

679
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.630
Somebody! Help!

680
00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.900
Somebody!

681
00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:02.560
Please! Turn it back!

682
00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:04.480
I beg of you!

683
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.140
One more time...

684
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.860
Please!

685
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.470
Okay.

686
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.400
<i>Taurus, today brings you good luck.</i>

687
00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:52.750
<i>Positive attitude toward
everything will bring good results.</i>


688
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:55.860
Good morning.

689
00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:58.160
Good morning.

690
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.400
Do you do that every day?

691
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:06.460
You think the creases on your skirt
would straighten on their own?


692
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:09.070
Thanks.

693
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.700
Wait a minute.
I'll get you breakfast.


694
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.550
I'll pack your lunch first.

695
00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.680
<i>I didn't notice it.</i>

696
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:28.230
<i>I thought I was repeating
the same day over and over.</i>


697
00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.010
Here.

698
00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:33.510
Have a nice day.

699
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:35.860
- I'm off.
- Okay.


700
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:40.640
- Bye.
- Yeah, have a nice day.


701
00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:42.440
<i>But...</i>

702
00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:47.750
<i>every day that I thought was the same
was that every day was different.</i>


703
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.590
Thank you. Have a nice day.

704
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:54.120
<i>If I can change it,
I'm sure it will change.</i>


705
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.180
Good morning. Thank you.

706
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.340
Good morning.
I'm off.


707
00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.430
Have a nice day.

708
00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:06.390
Hey, let's go!

709
00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.810
Look!

710
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:10.770
Wow, amazing!

711
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:14.530
Sakiko!

712
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.950
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


713
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.280
You waited for me?

714
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:20.240
Yeah.

715
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.080
I just want to talk to you.

716
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.770
I see. So they were part-timers.

717
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:29.670
Yeah.

718
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:37.010
I was afraid to confirm
the truth with Shuya.


719
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:38.930
Miyu...

720
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.550
I always wondered

721
00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:47.140
what Shuya liked about me.

722
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.150
Do you not trust Shuya?

723
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.440
It's not that.

724
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:57.180
I'm just not sure of myself.

725
00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.240
Miyu...

726
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:03.120
We started going out
on a whim, didn't we?


727
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.290
It's not on a whim.

728
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:09.410
What?

729
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:15.630
If you say it was on a whim,
I feel sorry for Shuya.


730
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.850
What do you mean?

731
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:27.140
I was told this would
be an absolute secret.


732
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.190
Ah, Sakiko.

733
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.150
Tell me a movie
you think Miyu would like.

734
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:36.300
- A movie Miyu might like?
- Shh!


735
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.150
Tell me.

736
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:43.140
That confession
during the first year...


737
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.200
I was thinking of going too.

738
00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:51.290
Shuya asked us to do it,
and we all set it up.


739
00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:54.250
What?

740
00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:02.840
Shuya had been in love with
you for a long time.


741
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:10.870
Ah... I feel so much better.

742
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:12.650
I finally said it.

743
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.410
Thank you.

744
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:30.450
Shuya really loves you, Miyu.

745
00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:31.860
Yes.

746
00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.290
What about you, Miyu?

747
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.800
I'll...

748
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.300
talk to Shuya properly.

749
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:48.260
Ah! Sakiko, aren't
you on school duty today?


750
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:49.940
I've got the test today. So go!

751
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.780
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

752
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:57.260
Yuto!

753
00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.900
What the heck...

754
01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.490
That scared me...
Don't turn around so suddenly.


755
01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:04.260
Good morning.

756
01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:10.870
What's up? You're looking well...

757
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:11.700
Yeah.

758
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.900
I...

759
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.980
am okay now.

760
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.760
- Are you?
- Yeah.


761
01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:23.340
Thank you for your concern.

762
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.510
I'm not really concerned, though.

763
01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:30.350
Oh, you are nosy.

764
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.630
Hey.

765
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:35.150
But...

766
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.830
thanks for your meddling.

767
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:46.510
Hey.

768
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.360
Good luck.

769
01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:53.290
Okay.

770
01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:15.100
Miyu?

771
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:18.770
Is Shuya in here?

772
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.070
Movie day, right?

773
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:27.820
Shuya told me that the
first of every month is movie day.


774
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:29.910
Yes.

775
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.800
That's nice.

776
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.830
But isn't it lonely if
that's all there is?


777
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.920
If I were you,
I'd want to see him more.


778
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:48.080
Take better care of him.

779
01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:54.970
I do take care of him.

780
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:02.060
I care about him a lot.

781
01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:17.500
Miyu?

782
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:19.720
Ah, Shuya.

783
01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:23.410
I have a favor to ask.

784
01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:25.090
Huh?

785
01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:45.730
Am I heavy?

786
01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.030
More than before.

787
01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:50.240
That's harsh.
Then why are we riding a bike?


788
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.980
Yuto said we could ride it.

789
01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.960
He's so nosy.

790
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:56.370
So what's the matter?

791
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:57.200
What?

792
01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.120
Your hair!

793
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:01.330
Ah... weird, isn't it?

794
01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.500
It looks so good on you!

795
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:06.460
Hey!

796
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:09.970
You think they know I skipped class?

797
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.200
Are you freaking out maybe?

798
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.590
No, I'm not.

799
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.140
Shut up.

800
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.990
I wanted to come here
one more time.


801
01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:39.170
Shuya.

802
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.440
Is it true you're working part-time?

803
01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.460
How did you know that...

804
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.430
Was it Tomoka?

805
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.730
I heard you two
were working together.


806
01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.690
It's just a coincidence.

807
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.690
A rental store at the next station

808
01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:12.550
Because we finish late,

809
01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:15.590
the manager asks me
to walk her to the station,


810
01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:19.910
so we sometimes go home together.

811
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.120
Why didn't you tell me?

812
01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:27.380
About your part-time job.

813
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.590
It's...

814
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.870
For our anniversary.

815
01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.130
What?

816
01:04:58.450 --> 01:05:00.410
Because I forgot last year...

817
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:06.460
our first year anniversary
since we started dating.


818
01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.420
That you had prepared a present for me...

819
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.930
and Sakiko told me about it later.

820
01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.970
I regretted it so much.

821
01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.060
So, I've been working
part-time secretly...


822
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.960
I promise.

823
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.300
I'll do it right on our 2nd anniversary.

824
01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.140
You are an idiot.

825
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.510
Idiot...

826
01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:03.850
Why don't you tell me?

827
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:07.090
Why...

828
01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:10.650
To surprise you?

829
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.410
Why are you crying?

830
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.780
I'm not crying.

831
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:25.140
Miyu.

832
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:27.790
I'm not crying.

833
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:35.900
I...

834
01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:41.930
love it when you smile.

835
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:55.530
Do you remember
the first day we met?


836
01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:58.650
I do.

837
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.750
It was love at first sight.

838
01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.460
You're lying.

839
01:07:56.670 --> 01:08:00.260
Your smile made me smile too.

840
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:03.510
So...

841
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:07.180
I want you to keep smiling.

842
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:12.130
Yeah.

843
01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.830
- Happy birthday!
- You're 18!


844
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:22.210
You're 18, first shot,
where do you want to go?


845
01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.070
- We should go somewhere together.
- Camping.


846
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:26.340
Not at an amusement park?

847
01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:29.430
Then, let's have Tomoka,
our star decide.


848
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.640
You're right.
Where do you want to go?


849
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.240
Sorry. Can I make a quick call?

850
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.310
Ah... okay, okay.

851
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:35.940
Then we'll decide on our own.

852
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.060
We'll decide on our own.
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.


853
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:47.320
Sorry. Miyu.

854
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:50.450
I have a part-time job today...

855
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:54.580
Shuya, do you know?

856
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.290
We can go to the
movies not just on the 1st,


857
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.770
but we can watch it anytime.

858
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:08.680
That's why...

859
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.470
I want to see you more.

860
01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.260
Okay.

861
01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.190
Today is all good.

862
01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:26.530
Let's go again.

863
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:29.660
Yeah, thanks.

864
01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:40.370
See you tomorrow.

865
01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.920
<i>I want you to smile, too.</i>

866
01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.020
Tomoka.

867
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.780
Thanks for calling me.

868
01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.510
The part-time job?
Are you not going?


869
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.990
Shuya, I need to talk to you.

870
01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:13.870
Huh?

871
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:20.410
I'm sorry.

872
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.460
I lied.

873
01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:31.000
I really wanna be with you today.

874
01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.890
You lied about having a shift?

875
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:43.150
I like you, Shuya.

876
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:55.570
I'm sorry.

877
01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.620
I'm sorry.

878
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:17.720
Tomoka.

879
01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.790
Happy birthday.

880
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.510
<i>[ No part-time.
I'll be waiting for you at the clock tower.
I want to see you. ]</i>


881
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.220
<i>No matter how many times it is repeated,</i>

882
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.990
<i>I may not be
able to change his fate.</i>

883
01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:07.170
<i>But still...</i>

884
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:13.650
<i>I want to save Shuya.</i>

885
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:55.150
Shuya!

886
01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.690
Miyu...

887
01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:37.780
Miyu!

888
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:42.990
Miyu! Somebody!

889
01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:44.220
Miyu...

890
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.250
Are you okay? Somebody,
somebody call an ambulance!


891
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:49.170
Somebody!

892
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:52.840
Miyu! Are you okay...

893
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:54.660
Miyu!

894
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.930
Thank goodness...

895
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.150
Miyu...

896
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:52.310
Miyu...

897
01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.320
Miyu!

898
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.640
Miyu?

899
01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:31.270
Ah, Miyu...

900
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.480
I'm glad you're safe.

901
01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.110
Mom.

902
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.270
Thank goodness...

903
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.150
Shuya...

904
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:48.370
What about Shuya?

905
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:53.120
Shuya saved you.

906
01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:00.730
What do you mean?

907
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:08.640
He protected you when
you almost got run over...


908
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:41.930
<i>Miyu.</i>

909
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:45.260
<i>- Listen to me!
- Enough.</i>


910
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.550
<i>I'm not mad.</i>

911
01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.760
<i>If you want to play
with other girls, go ahead.</i>


912
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:57.350
<i>It's not my business.</i>

913
01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.530
<i>Miyu!</i>

914
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:53.450
Shuya...

915
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:57.960
Wake up.

916
01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.050
No, Shuya! Wake up!

917
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.880
Please!

918
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:09.380
Wake up!

919
01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.800
Miyu...

920
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:21.650
Shuya...

921
01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:26.400
Miyu...

922
01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:33.030
Shuya.

923
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:41.000
Miyu.

924
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:21.560
<i>[ To Miyu ]</i>

925
01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:24.000
Shuya was holding on to it.

926
01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.870
<i>To Miyu.</i>

927
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.500
<i>I can't speak honestly
when I'm face to face with you.</i>


928
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.420
<i>So I'm writing you a letter.</i>

929
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:27.170
<i>I'm sorry we haven't
spoken more often lately.</i>


930
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:35.510
Delicious!

931
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:37.000
You're exaggerating.

932
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.280
I'll take one!

933
01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.790
It's really good!

934
01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:50.710
<i>I haven't seen your
smiling face for a while.</i>


935
01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:53.130
He's here.

936
01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.530
- Okay, I'll record it.
- Okay, nice.


937
01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:05.480
Ready!

938
01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.520
Yay!

939
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.690
I made a mistake.

940
01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:19.870
I'll go on ahead. Sorry, sorry.

941
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:21.410
Miyu!

942
01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:29.300
<i>Soon it will be our
two-year anniversary.</i>


943
01:22:31.630 --> 01:22:33.040
<i>I'm sorry about last year.</i>

944
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.100
<i>This anniversary,</i>

945
01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:47.060
<i>I want to make you smile.</i>

946
01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.520
<i>I want to spend time
with you this year.</i>


947
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:41.860
<i>I wanna be with you</i>

948
01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:44.340
<i>forever and ever.</i>

949
01:23:57.630 --> 01:23:58.630
<i>Shuya.</i>

950
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.660
<i>I thought it would never end.</i>

951
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:16.120
<i>I thought the same day
would go on forever.</i>


952
01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.840
Miyu!

953
01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:26.470
<i>But...</i>

954
01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.600
<i>every day was
a completely different day.</i>


955
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:39.510
<i>Every day ends
and a new day begins again.</i>


956
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:45.950
<i>And one day,
the end will come.</i>


957
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:51.720
<i>But I'm not afraid.</i>

958
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:58.070
<i>I live every day
as if it were my last.</i>


959

<i>Even if it's sad or painful,
I feel it as much as I can</i>


960
01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.990
<i>and create a different everyday.</i>

961
01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:34.580
<i>When I'm sad, 
I look at the sky,</i>

962
01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.960
<i>when I'm in pain, 
I look at my feet,</i>

963
01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:43.170
<i>and pick up a smile.</i>

964
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:59.770
<i>The rain will clear up someday,</i>

965
01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.730
<i>and the blue sky will spread
out in the sky and under my feet,</i>


966
01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.240
<i>as long as I keep smiling.</i>

967

Miyu!

968
01:27:58.410 --> 01:27:59.870
I missed you so much.

969
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.760
