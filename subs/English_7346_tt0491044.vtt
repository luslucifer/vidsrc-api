1
00:03:46.178 --> 00:03:47.178
Waiter.

2
00:03:47.913 --> 00:03:50.473
Breakfast with coffee.
Coming right up.


3
00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.466
Stop shaking your feet.

4
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.775
Breakfast.

5
00:04:19.912 --> 00:04:22.380
A sparrow flew into my apartment.

6
00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:24.415
Is it alive?

7
00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:25.883
Yes.
Not sure what it means.


8
00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:28.749
Mac, do you think it's a sign?

9
00:04:29.054 --> 00:04:30.455
I'd rather think about girls!

10
00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:32.185
That's all you think about.
Yes!


11
00:04:32.992 --> 00:04:34.159
Bo?

12
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.286
Which horse will you bet on?

13
00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:37.756
Answer my question.

14
00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:42.493
The sparrow will bring you bad luck.

15
00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:47.405
A friend of a friend bought a flat.

16
00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:51.142
The flat lost 50% market value
after a sparrow flew in.


17
00:04:51.143 --> 00:04:52.977
He and his wife

18
00:04:52.978 --> 00:04:54.512
both got prostate tumors.

19
00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:55.571
Isn't that bad luck?

20
00:04:55.815 --> 00:04:59.546
Nice story,
you can be a storyteller.


21
00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:05.089
I learned everything from you.

22
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.284
Really?

23
00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:16.458
Let me take the lead today.

24
00:05:19.572 --> 00:05:20.834
Can you handle it?

25
00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:22.868
You still have a lot to learn.

26
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:32.038
Sorry.
Watch where you're going.


27
00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.126
Sorry Miss, are you alright?
It's okay.


28
00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.628
Sound's great.

29
00:07:01.507 --> 00:07:04.567
Sorry. I'll get it for you.
Never mind.


30
00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:09.242
That's fine, I'll call you.

31
00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:10.609
Okay...

32
00:07:31.137 --> 00:07:32.137
Here's your share.

33
00:07:38.712 --> 00:07:40.112
It's a lot of money!

34
00:07:40.113 --> 00:07:41.714
This is peanuts.

35
00:07:41.715 --> 00:07:43.716
Ever made over $10,000 a day?

36
00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:46.352
The fat guy carried
big bills on him...


37
00:07:46.353 --> 00:07:48.947
They are Singaporean money.

38
00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:50.581
Trying to be smart?

39
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:53.650
Think you can do better?

40
00:07:54.094 --> 00:07:55.755
You're not ready to lead.

41
00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:57.327
I want to try.

42
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.997
Get rid of the wallets.

43
00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.632
You're not ready!

44
00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:02.254
I'll stash away the
foreign currencies.


45
00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:57.423
Had lunch yet?
Yes.


46
00:08:57.424 --> 00:08:59.016
Drinks on me.
Thank you.


47
00:11:30.643 --> 00:11:32.644
Come on... Bank!

48
00:12:08.281 --> 00:12:09.281
I win.

49
00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:27.830
Place your bets.

50
00:13:30.063 --> 00:13:31.587
Let me take you home.

51
00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:50.848
Drink.

52
00:14:16.008 --> 00:14:17.100
One more bottle.

53
00:14:27.854 --> 00:14:29.116
Mister...

54
00:14:29.822 --> 00:14:31.016
Here's your wine.

55
00:14:59.152 --> 00:15:00.380
Wait up.

56
00:16:05.218 --> 00:16:06.685
Call me.

57
00:16:49.795 --> 00:16:51.262
Can you take me to the city?

58
00:16:55.134 --> 00:16:56.533
I'll pay you.

59
00:17:18.224 --> 00:17:19.316
Here.

60
00:17:24.363 --> 00:17:25.921
What's your phone number?

61
00:17:26.732 --> 00:17:28.723
9720-7648

62
00:17:31.904 --> 00:17:33.201
I'll call you.

63
00:18:16.749 --> 00:18:17.909
Let's go.

64
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.190
Just had it repaired. It's yours.

65
00:18:42.074 --> 00:18:45.737
My mother gave it to my late wife.

66
00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:27.845
Time for your medicine.

67
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.180
Set it down.

68
00:19:31.957 --> 00:19:34.448
Make sure Mr. Fu takes his medicine.

69
00:19:34.694 --> 00:19:35.694
Yes.

70
00:19:45.104 --> 00:19:46.196
I'm going out.

71
00:19:59.518 --> 00:20:00.883
What's wrong?

72
00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:03.014
You sound unhappy.

73
00:20:09.962 --> 00:20:11.395
Have you been drinking?

74
00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:15.233
What's wrong?

75
00:20:52.204 --> 00:20:53.466
Get in.

76
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.560
Where to?

77
00:23:44.143 --> 00:23:45.576
Let's go to your place.

78
00:23:53.752 --> 00:23:55.151
I live above there.

79
00:23:56.388 --> 00:23:58.219
The one with curtains.

80
00:23:59.024 --> 00:24:00.582
I often see you.

81
00:24:12.571 --> 00:24:14.402
Why are the photos
in black and white?


82
00:24:15.574 --> 00:24:18.566
Colors can be deceiving.

83
00:24:26.352 --> 00:24:27.618
What is it?

84
00:24:27.619 --> 00:24:29.177
A sparrow.

85
00:24:35.527 --> 00:24:37.085
Does it pick pockets like you?

86
00:24:42.034 --> 00:24:43.228
You two are alike.

87
00:24:54.713 --> 00:24:56.237
Let it be.

88
00:24:58.417 --> 00:25:00.146
She'll return to the cage herself.

89
00:25:04.189 --> 00:25:05.383
Can I have it?

90
00:25:07.092 --> 00:25:08.354
Yes.

91
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:33.684
Promise me.

92
00:25:37.256 --> 00:25:39.349
Don't let anyone see these photos.

93
00:25:41.727 --> 00:25:43.058
What do you want?

94
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.475
"Chung Chun Lei"

95
00:27:21.693 --> 00:27:22.921
What's so funny?

96
00:27:23.162 --> 00:27:24.754
What's so funny?

97
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:27.659
Get to work!

98
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.458
We are waiting for you.

99
00:27:33.405 --> 00:27:35.896
The bike's yours?
It's a piece of crap.


100
00:27:36.975 --> 00:27:38.909
It's broken.

101
00:27:39.878 --> 00:27:41.311
Shut up.

102
00:27:41.446 --> 00:27:42.680
You broke it! Pay for it!

103
00:27:42.681 --> 00:27:44.273
But it hurt my back!

104
00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:45.683
I'm not paying!

105
00:27:45.684 --> 00:27:47.276
We'll each throw in
$50 for a new one.


106
00:29:09.968 --> 00:29:11.230
Run!

107
00:29:11.403 --> 00:29:13.394
Chun Lei, run!

108
00:30:36.788 --> 00:30:38.722
Fried rice.

109
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.701
Mac is in the hospital

110
00:30:50.702 --> 00:30:53.500
getting his wound stitched up.

111
00:30:53.672 --> 00:30:54.934
What happened?

112
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:57.472
What happened to you?

113
00:30:58.377 --> 00:30:59.742
What about you?

114
00:31:13.992 --> 00:31:17.450
Did either of you...

115
00:31:18.697 --> 00:31:20.392
meet a beautiful woman?

116
00:32:53.925 --> 00:32:55.654
Told you the sparrow
brings bad luck.


117
00:32:57.095 --> 00:32:58.221
See?

118
00:35:27.178 --> 00:35:28.270
Get out.

119
00:35:29.447 --> 00:35:34.714
Get out...

120
00:35:55.106 --> 00:35:57.007
Miss, do you need help?

121
00:35:57.008 --> 00:35:58.339
Stay out of this.

122
00:35:58.743 --> 00:36:01.769
No men would want to
see a woman harmed.


123
00:36:05.116 --> 00:36:07.384
Miss

124
00:36:07.385 --> 00:36:09.751
I'll do anything to protect you.

125
00:36:37.115 --> 00:36:43.145
It's all our fault...
Sorry for getting in your way.


126
00:36:56.201 --> 00:36:57.828
Let's go back down.

127
00:38:01.132 --> 00:38:02.933
I didn't know he'd hurt you.

128
00:38:02.934 --> 00:38:03.992
Liar!

129
00:38:14.746 --> 00:38:16.714
You know they spy
on you all the time.


130
00:38:30.729 --> 00:38:31.991
I'm sorry.

131
00:38:40.739 --> 00:38:41.967
Who's behind this?

132
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.149
Mr. Fu is a good man.

133
00:38:56.154 --> 00:38:57.849
He treats me well.

134
00:38:59.324 --> 00:39:01.849
I've lived a good life these years.

135
00:39:03.762 --> 00:39:06.162
Everything I had was the best.

136
00:39:13.572 --> 00:39:16.040
He went out of
his way to help me.

137
00:39:20.912 --> 00:39:22.641
I owe him so much.

138
00:39:25.717 --> 00:39:27.241
He's getting older everyday.

139
00:39:29.354 --> 00:39:31.584
I should take care of him.

140
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:38.160
No...

141
00:39:43.201 --> 00:39:45.032
I should leave him.

142
00:39:50.909 --> 00:39:52.638
To find myself...

143
00:39:55.213 --> 00:39:56.373
A true love.

144
00:40:23.308 --> 00:40:24.741
Help me.

145
00:40:25.276 --> 00:40:26.675
How?

146
00:40:26.811 --> 00:40:28.039
Enough with the excuses.

147
00:40:29.214 --> 00:40:32.012
Don't drag my brothers into this.

148
00:40:45.196 --> 00:40:46.629
Here's your money.

149
00:40:58.209 --> 00:40:59.369
Where are you going?

150
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:02.775
I want to make the old man pay.

151
00:41:02.881 --> 00:41:04.906
I'm in!

152
00:41:05.016 --> 00:41:07.644
We need to come up with a plan.

153
00:41:07.819 --> 00:41:09.309
Don't go your own ways!

154
00:41:35.346 --> 00:41:36.779
It's me.

155
00:41:47.525 --> 00:41:49.322
I'm sorry.

156
00:41:58.436 --> 00:42:02.099
Mr. Fu found out...
They refused to help.


157
00:43:29.427 --> 00:43:33.329
"Chun Lei, 9340-3777"

158
00:44:08.467 --> 00:44:09.957
Just go home.

159
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.635
Why don't you go home?

160
00:44:17.576 --> 00:44:18.634
Think you're good?

161
00:44:20.946 --> 00:44:22.174
Good enough.

162
00:44:25.251 --> 00:44:26.513
Think you can handle it?

163
00:44:27.519 --> 00:44:28.952
Nothing to it.

164
00:44:38.631 --> 00:44:41.122
Prove it. Pick the cop's handcuffs.

165
00:44:47.706 --> 00:44:49.537
Piece of cake.
Your sure?


166
00:45:49.168 --> 00:45:50.567
Officer, you dropped your cuffs.

167
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:00.676
Officer, you dropped your tie.

168
00:46:23.168 --> 00:46:24.430
Just go home.

169
00:46:24.536 --> 00:46:25.969
You go home.

170
00:48:41.473 --> 00:48:43.841
Delivery for Dr. Chan?
Yes.


171
00:48:43.842 --> 00:48:45.332
How much?
$120


172
00:48:47.146 --> 00:48:48.408
Hold the lift!

173
00:48:56.622 --> 00:48:58.385
Delivery. $120.

174
00:48:59.892 --> 00:49:01.291
Thanks.

175
00:49:15.274 --> 00:49:16.974
We have an appointment
with Dr. Chan.


176
00:49:16.975 --> 00:49:19.243
Please take a seat.

177
00:49:19.244 --> 00:49:20.438
Thank you.

178
00:49:24.716 --> 00:49:25.716
Thank you.

179
00:49:28.921 --> 00:49:30.889
Please fill out the forms.

180
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.567
Call me when Mr. 
Fu is finished.

181
00:50:16.568 --> 00:50:17.626
Yes.

182
00:50:51.837 --> 00:50:53.361
Please excuse me, Mr Fu.

183
00:51:00.545 --> 00:51:02.513
Very effective.

184
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:39.856
Sorry.
Excuse me.


185
00:56:07.587 --> 00:56:08.781
Get in.

186
00:57:05.745 --> 00:57:07.872
You will inherit everything I own.

187
00:57:16.989 --> 00:57:18.286
No point to steal.

188
00:58:10.376 --> 00:58:14.312
Be careful of pickpockets.

189
00:58:15.448 --> 00:58:17.177
There are four of them!

190
00:58:27.059 --> 00:58:29.994
This is Bo, leave a message...

191
00:58:34.433 --> 00:58:37.402
I'm Sak, I can't answer
the phone right now...


192
00:58:42.308 --> 00:58:44.936
This is Mac, leave me a message...

193
00:59:55.247 --> 00:59:57.238
"Pickpockets"

194
01:00:13.265 --> 01:00:16.063
Mr. Fu wants to see you.
If you're afraid,


195
01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:20.939
bring a friend, or your lawyer.

196
01:00:26.445 --> 01:00:27.844
Or call the cops.

197
01:01:11.257 --> 01:01:12.383
Mr. Fu.

198
01:01:18.063 --> 01:01:20.497
I'm Fu Kim Tong.

199
01:01:26.038 --> 01:01:27.665
My brothers didn't mean any harm.

200
01:01:35.047 --> 01:01:36.344
Someone set them up.

201
01:01:42.354 --> 01:01:43.685
Apologize.

202
01:01:44.356 --> 01:01:45.687
Apologize!

203
01:01:49.028 --> 01:01:50.188
Apologize!

204
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:56.092
They were just trying to help.

205
01:01:57.069 --> 01:02:00.334
But this was a misunderstanding.

206
01:02:02.574 --> 01:02:05.634
Chun Lei can explain.

207
01:02:09.648 --> 01:02:13.106
Mr. Fu and I had some problems.

208
01:02:14.253 --> 01:02:15.515
But not anymore.

209
01:02:17.456 --> 01:02:21.119
I'm doing fine.
Thanks for your help.


210
01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:26.995
Don't worry about me from now on.

211
01:02:29.201 --> 01:02:32.102
I'm happy.

212
01:02:34.406 --> 01:02:36.101
You see?

213
01:02:36.508 --> 01:02:37.702
Yes.

214
01:02:38.644 --> 01:02:40.078
Are you sure?

215
01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:41.239
Sure.

216
01:02:42.247 --> 01:02:43.475
You may go now.

217
01:02:45.985 --> 01:02:47.077
Thank you.

218
01:02:55.394 --> 01:02:56.520
Wait.

219
01:02:57.796 --> 01:03:00.287
I almost forgot to
return your watch.


220
01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:10.174
Back in the days,
pickpocketing required real skills.


221
01:03:10.175 --> 01:03:12.700
Kiddo, take a word of advice:

222
01:03:13.045 --> 01:03:16.208
You don't have what it takes.

223
01:03:16.615 --> 01:03:18.139
Understand?
Yes.


224
01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.013
You guys go on.

225
01:03:50.649 --> 01:03:52.207
Forget about it.

226
01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:55.713
Listen to me.

227
01:03:57.089 --> 01:03:59.649
I have to prove
to him what I got.

228
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.601
What is it?
Mr. Fu, how about a few words?


229
01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:46.804
Are you afraid of me?
Get out.


230
01:04:46.805 --> 01:04:47.805
Lung, back off.

231
01:04:53.345 --> 01:04:54.676
Why would I be afraid?

232
01:05:09.862 --> 01:05:12.456
I came back to get even with you.

233
01:05:13.632 --> 01:05:15.566
Something bothers me.

234
01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.675
If she doesn't like you,
you should let her go.


235
01:05:24.843 --> 01:05:28.210
Love can't be forced. Understand?

236
01:05:32.451 --> 01:05:34.351
You can take it all out on me.

237
01:05:36.421 --> 01:05:38.821
What kind of a man would force love.

238
01:05:39.324 --> 01:05:41.315
You'll lose all your reputation.

239
01:05:41.627 --> 01:05:45.119
You're too old to play Casanova!

240
01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:48.765
She deserves better.

241
01:05:50.502 --> 01:05:51.867
Get it?

242
01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:56.364
I tried to be nice to
you, but you want to play.


243
01:05:57.709 --> 01:06:00.610
You were still in diapers
when I was picking pockets.


244
01:06:01.213 --> 01:06:03.247
You can't afford to play this game!

245
01:06:03.248 --> 01:06:06.740
I don't care about your past.

246
01:06:07.452 --> 01:06:08.714
I just know you bully women.

247
01:06:09.354 --> 01:06:10.912
Shut up!
I'll shut up.


248
01:06:12.257 --> 01:06:13.656
Let her talk.

249
01:06:16.395 --> 01:06:17.953
Let her say it herself.

250
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.728
Go on.

251
01:06:36.512 --> 01:06:37.706
I'm sorry.

252
01:06:41.784 --> 01:06:43.445
Get it?

253
01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.545
I'll beat you with one hand, kiddo!

254
01:07:01.838 --> 01:07:04.639
If you can walk away
with her passport tonight


255
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.198
I'll let her go!

256
01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.844
If not, I'll cut off your hands.

257
01:07:08.845 --> 01:07:10.278
No problem.

258
01:07:11.247 --> 01:07:14.876
If he loses,

259
01:07:15.518 --> 01:07:17.418
you'll stay by my side...

260
01:07:18.287 --> 01:07:20.346
Until the day I die.

261
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:55.297
I cut you.

262
01:16:55.999 --> 01:16:57.489
I am getting rusty.

263
01:17:21.891 --> 01:17:23.119
Come out.

264
01:17:44.047 --> 01:17:45.514
You can go now.

265
01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:52.615
Go on.

266
01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.322
Thank you.

267
01:18:05.034 --> 01:18:06.228
Leave.

268
01:18:22.085 --> 01:18:23.518
Take care.

269
01:18:31.528 --> 01:18:32.654
Watch your health.

270
01:18:33.596 --> 01:18:35.325
I know what to do.

271
01:18:38.067 --> 01:18:39.125
Drive.

272
01:20:06.723 --> 01:20:08.190
Goodbye.

273
01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.793
Hope we'll never meet again.

274
01:20:29.345 --> 01:20:30.573
Have a good trip.

275
01:20:34.417 --> 01:20:35.748
Goodbye.

276
01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:51.367
Easy here.

277
01:20:55.071 --> 01:20:56.470
Get in.

278
01:21:03.312 --> 01:21:04.609
To the airport.

279
01:21:23.599 --> 01:21:25.066
I'm going to the airport!

280
01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:32.567
What now?

281
01:21:33.242 --> 01:21:34.766
Grab lunch. Then go to work.

282
01:21:37.513 --> 01:21:38.680
Get going guys.

283
01:21:38.681 --> 01:21:39.841
Let's get going then.

284
01:21:40.249 --> 01:21:41.375
Give me a ride.

285
01:21:41.617 --> 01:21:42.751
Thank you.

286
01:21:42.752 --> 01:21:43.852
Keep it going.

287
01:21:43.853 --> 01:21:44.853
You give it a try.

288
01:21:45.288 --> 01:21:46.585
You're the boss...

289
01:21:49.659 --> 01:21:50.492
It's your turn.

290
01:21:50.493 --> 01:21:53.724
I don't want to take your place.

291
01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:57.661
You have more to learn.

292
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.307
It's my sparrow.

293
01:22:07.777 --> 01:22:08.777
What sparrow?

294
01:22:08.778 --> 01:22:09.945
It's my sparrow.

295
01:22:09.946 --> 01:22:11.504
So?

296
01:22:20.356 --> 01:22:21.653
Be careful.

297
01:22:26.429 --> 01:22:28.124
Head on shot.

298
01:22:35.772 --> 01:22:37.399
Back to work...
