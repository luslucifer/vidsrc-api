1
00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:01.296
I love that song.

2
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:03.439
How did it feel to win "album
of the year" at the Grammys?


3
00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:07.705
Well, not too long ago,

4
00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:10.274
I was playing in bars and clubs
around Nashville,


5
00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:12.976
so winning a Grammy's
been quite a change.


6
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.544
Catherine Mann.

7
00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:18.111
It is a real thrill to have
you in the studio today.


8
00:01:18.113 --> 00:01:20.546
Thank you, Stan.
It's a pleasure to be here.


9
00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:22.115
You discovered Bradley,
didn't you?


10
00:01:22.117 --> 00:01:24.550
I mean, he was already
well-known in Nashville,


11
00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:26.784
but you brought him to Los Angeles
and got him a recording deal.


12
00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:30.386
I introduced him to a few people,
but he's a pretty talented guy.


13
00:01:30.388 --> 00:01:32.954
He got himself a recording deal.

14
00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:35.354
And the two of you have been
inseparable ever since?


15
00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.892
I think the first time
I heard Bradley sing...


16
00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:42.127
I fell in love with him.

17
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.097
<i>Are you saying the two of you
might have some news for us one day?</i>


18
00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.163
<i>We like to keep
our private life private...</i>


19
00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:49.430
<i>We're engaged to be married!</i>

20
00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:52.699
<i>Now, I know we agreed
not to share this publicly,</i>


21
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:55.835
<i>but I just want the world
to know how happy I am.</i>


22
00:01:55.837 --> 00:01:58.103
<i>Well!
You heard it here first.</i>


23
00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:01.505
<i>Catherine Mann and Bradley Suttons
are engaged to be married!</i>


24
00:02:01.507 --> 00:02:03.873
Well, congratulations, Bradbird.

25
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:06.642
<i>On the outside, he's shocked
that I shared it publicly,</i>


26
00:02:06.644 --> 00:02:07.741
<i>but on the inside...</i>

27
00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:08.676
Morning, James.

28
00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:10.009
Mornin'!

29
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:11.244
What brings you out here
so early?


30
00:02:11.646 --> 00:02:13.145
Well...

31
00:02:13.147 --> 00:02:14.646
I had to come out here
to see you,


32
00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:17.415
since you won't answer any
of my phone calls or emails.


33
00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:20.183
Well, I don't got time
for phone calls and emails.


34
00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:22.885
I got a ranch to run.
How's your mama?


35
00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:24.119
She...
She's real good.


36
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:25.719
She get those garden roses
I sent over?


37
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:28.621
- She did, and I...
- She is such a sweet lady.


38
00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.891
- Yeah, yeah, she is.
- James, do you want some coffee?


39
00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:33.458
I'd love a half a cup of coffee,

40
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.361
but you need to stop changing the subject
cause we need to talk about your finances.


41
00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:39.795
Now, my mama told me

42
00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:42.429
never to talk about politics
or money in mixed company.


43
00:02:42.432 --> 00:02:45.265
There's no getting around
this, Sarah.


44
00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:48.466
I'm gonna have to foreclose on you
and sell off this ranch,


45
00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.868
if you can't find a way to
make the mortgage payments.


46
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.569
If it were up to me...

47
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.203
It is up to you, Jimmy. You're
the president of Milltown bank.


48
00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:56.406
I don't own the bank, Sarah!

49
00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.039
I'm just waiting to hear
if I got this grant


50
00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:00.908
from the Equine
Rehabilitation Fund.


51
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.875
I've given you six months more
than I have any right to,


52
00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:06.212
and now I have no choice.

53
00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:13.382
One month.
That's all I'm asking.


54
00:03:13.384 --> 00:03:17.451
One month, Sarah.
That takes us to June first.


55
00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.987
I will tell you what.

56
00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.921
If I don't have the money
by June 1st,


57
00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:24.922
I will walk into your office,
I will shake your hand,


58
00:03:24.924 --> 00:03:28.524
and I will sign this ranch
over to you.


59
00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:31.560
Well, that's...
That's fair.


60
00:03:31.562 --> 00:03:34.428
- You need me to sign something?
- You just did.


61
00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:39.131
That guy grew up here.

62
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.933
Bradley Suttons.
He used to live next door.


63
00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:44.134
Moved away when he was about 13,

64
00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:45.968
but I believe he still
owns the house.


65
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.235
I remember.

66
00:03:47.237 --> 00:03:50.138
His parents were killed in that
car accident, over in Greenbrier.


67
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:55.841
Must be about the most famous
resident to come out of Milltown.


68
00:03:55.843 --> 00:03:58.410
I guess you knew
him pretty well?


69
00:03:58.412 --> 00:04:02.512
Knew him?
I was married to him.


70
00:04:43.704 --> 00:04:47.673
It's okay to cry, Bradbird.
I won't tell anyone.


71
00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:50.275
I can't believe I have
to move away from here.


72
00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:52.975
You'll be fine.

73
00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:55.476
You're so smart and everything.

74
00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:58.346
I guess
I'm sort of an orphan now.


75
00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:01.914
I don't really have
a family anymore.


76
00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:05.083
Hey. Everyone's looking
for you guys.


77
00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:11.988
- Let's get married.
- What?


78
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.823
We should get married,
then we'll be each other's family.


79
00:05:15.826 --> 00:05:17.959
We're only 13.
We can't get married.


80
00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:21.893
Yes, we can. This is my barn,
so I make the rules.


81
00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:26.129
You're my best friend and I say
we can do anything we want.


82
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:28.864
Well, how are we supposed
to get married?


83
00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:29.998
I can marry you.

84
00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.567
My dad's a pastor.

85
00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.100
I've seen him do it,
like, a hundred times.


86
00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:37.037
It's not that hard.

87
00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:45.975
<i>"Dear Bradbird...</i>

88
00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:47.642
<i>"I saw you on TV,</i>

89
00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:50.310
<i>"and I couldn't help but
remember all those years ago</i>


90
00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:52.012
<i>when we were friends".</i>

91
00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:59.417
<i>I am getting calls from
people, from vanity fair.</i>


92
00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.518
They all want to
photograph your wedding,


93
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.951
and they are willing
to pay huge!


94
00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:06.321
Not gonna happen.
We want a private wedding.


95
00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:09.322
Yes, we want something
intimate and personal.


96
00:06:09.324 --> 00:06:11.358
Why?

97
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.360
A wedding should be shared
with those who love you most.


98
00:06:15.362 --> 00:06:17.794
Your fans.

99
00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:19.327
By the way...

100
00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:23.298
- This came for you.
- What is it?


101
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.999
Well, I have no idea.

102
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:27.934
But I bet it's a fan writing
you a letter for an autograph,


103
00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:29.501
because they love you

104
00:06:29.503 --> 00:06:31.303
and they want to be
a part of your life,


105
00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:33.870
and that is why you need to
share the happy day with them.


106
00:06:36.407 --> 00:06:39.474
Fine. I'll give it
to the PR department.


107
00:06:39.476 --> 00:06:42.076
There's something in here.

108
00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:50.913
It's from a fan, all right, a fan
who's clearly in love with you.


109
00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:52.614
She sent you a diamond ring.

110
00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:55.116
I'm sure it's not real.

111
00:06:55.118 --> 00:06:58.985
This is a Tiffany cut one half-a-carat
diamond in a white gold setting,


112
00:06:58.987 --> 00:07:00.686
and...

113
00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:03.089
It comes with a love letter.

114
00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:05.757
Of course it does!

115
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.258
"Dear Bradbird... "

116
00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:11.094
"I saw you on TV,

117
00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:12.894
"and I couldn't help
but remember


118
00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:16.331
"all those years ago,
when we were friends.


119
00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:19.498
I've thought about you often
over the years".


120
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.932
"Bradbird"?

121
00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:25.635
No one's called me that in ages.
Let me see that.


122
00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:26.770
First love?

123
00:07:30.273 --> 00:07:31.505
We were 13.

124
00:07:31.507 --> 00:07:33.373
She was your girlfriend?

125
00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:36.641
No. She was my wife.

126
00:07:37.943 --> 00:07:40.445
It was the day
of my parents' funeral.


127
00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:45.049
I was so sad and lost.

128
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:47.150
Felt alone in the world.

129
00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:49.618
Sarah, she...

130
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.885
She offered to marry me,
so I'd have a family.


131
00:07:53.754 --> 00:07:55.654
That's so nice.

132
00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:57.221
She was a great girl.

133
00:07:57.223 --> 00:08:00.724
And this ring...
This is my mother's ring.


134
00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:03.159
I think I'm jealous.

135
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:04.259
No, the girl I remember,

136
00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:06.227
she was real skinny,
with freckles,


137
00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:09.862
and she preferred
horses to people.


138
00:08:11.266 --> 00:08:13.230
You know, I still own
my parents' house.


139
00:08:13.232 --> 00:08:17.067
I've never been back there
since that day.


140
00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:19.667
I should probably
deal with that.


141
00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:22.770
You know, you should come
with me, see where I grew up.


142
00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:24.272
I'd love to.

143
00:08:24.274 --> 00:08:25.539
It's impossible.

144
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:28.375
She's doing a movie.
You're under contract.


145
00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:30.842
Well, why don't you go back?

146
00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:34.243
Take care of things, sell the
house, have some down-time,


147
00:08:34.245 --> 00:08:36.345
and after we get married,

148
00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:40.980
I'll go back with you,
and see where you grew up.


149
00:08:40.982 --> 00:08:44.383
I'd love to know
that part of you.


150
00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:47.419
I'd like that.

151
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:48.853
I'll see you tonight.

152
00:08:54.858 --> 00:08:57.790
A small wedding?
In Italy?


153
00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:59.158
In a way.

154
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.762
I've rented an Italian villa
and...


155
00:09:03.764 --> 00:09:06.131
Only invited my closest friends.

156
00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:09.432
I should have known
you had a plan.


157
00:09:18.673 --> 00:09:21.340
I'm just here for a day or so,
to sell the house.


158
00:09:21.342 --> 00:09:23.475
Figure there's no point
in holding on to it.


159
00:09:23.477 --> 00:09:27.310
Well, it looks like you paid off
the mortgage years ago,


160
00:09:27.312 --> 00:09:30.879
and the maintenance staff that takes
care of the house is on retainer,


161
00:09:30.881 --> 00:09:33.080
so all you need to do
is put it on the market.


162
00:09:33.082 --> 00:09:34.280
Great.

163
00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.915
I, uh...

164
00:09:35.917 --> 00:09:38.417
I remember
what happened to your folks.


165
00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:40.485
It was, uh, was a huge shock
for this community,


166
00:09:40.487 --> 00:09:41.852
one of the toughest...

167
00:09:41.854 --> 00:09:44.487
So, I guess that's all the business
we need to take care of?


168
00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:46.020
Right, right, right.

169
00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:47.322
I will put you in touch
with Sally Hartford.


170
00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:50.990
She's the local real estate broker
we use here at the bank.


171
00:09:50.992 --> 00:09:53.493
She can put your house on the
market, take care of everything.


172
00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:56.127
I appreciate that, sir.
Thank you.


173
00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:59.062
Yeah, I'm gonna be here in Texas
for the next day or so,


174
00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:01.897
and then I'll head to
my studio in Nashville,


175
00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.400
and try to write some more music
before I head out on tour.


176
00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:08.502
Hank, I'm... I'm gonna
have to call you back.


177
00:10:08.504 --> 00:10:11.871
Yeah. All right.

178
00:10:11.873 --> 00:10:13.539
I didn't give you
my address, did I?


179
00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:15.839
Everybody knows
where your house is.


180
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:17.875
You're pretty famous
here in Milltown.


181
00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:20.274
They got a sandwich named
after you down at the diner.


182
00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:21.276
Really?

183
00:10:21.278 --> 00:10:23.345
Oh, yeah.

184
00:10:23.347 --> 00:10:25.212
I'm sorry, but do I know you?

185
00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:27.179
Yeah! We went to school together.

186
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:30.149
- Sam Hartford.
- "Sammy" Hartford?


187
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:33.050
I do remember you.

188
00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:35.284
Hey, I play lead guitar
in a band in town.


189
00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:36.684
We play all of your hits.

190
00:10:36.686 --> 00:10:39.320
That's great.

191
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:43.655
- Here you go.
- Oh, yeah.


192
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:47.392
- Don't you want your change?
- You keep it.


193
00:12:33.423 --> 00:12:35.291
Excuse me, sir?

194
00:12:35.293 --> 00:12:39.027
I was looking for the family
who used to live in this house?


195
00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:44.763
There was a skinny little girl
with brown hair and freckles?


196
00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:51.033
I saw an interview you did once,

197
00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:53.136
where you said you'd come home
to Milltown when pigs fly.


198
00:12:53.138 --> 00:12:55.936
Sky seems clear of swine.

199
00:12:56.938 --> 00:13:00.140
- Sarah Standor?
- Bradley Suttons.


200
00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:02.373
You look so different!

201
00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:04.143
Well, you seem to have outgrown
your awkward phase, too.


202
00:13:04.145 --> 00:13:05.909
But I don't know if that's true.

203
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:09.245
You never had an awkward phase.
You're just handsome as ever.


204
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.147
What brings you to town?

205
00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:13.580
I'm selling my parents' house.

206
00:13:13.582 --> 00:13:15.416
I should have
dealt with it years ago,


207
00:13:15.418 --> 00:13:17.450
but I never found the time
to get back here.


208
00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:21.153
Well, time does fly when
you're busy winning Grammys,


209
00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:24.121
becoming a superstar.

210
00:13:24.123 --> 00:13:28.590
- We're all real proud of you.
- Thanks.


211
00:13:29.492 --> 00:13:32.259
You know, I've been keeping up
your mother's flower garden.


212
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:35.027
That's real nice of you.
She would've appreciated that.


213
00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:38.196
Felt like it was the least
I could do for her.


214
00:13:38.198 --> 00:13:40.697
She's the one who taught me
how to plant and grow flowers,


215
00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:42.298
and now I have
a big garden out back.


216
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.667
I supply the flowers
for most of the local florists.


217
00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:47.835
Your family still
raising race horses?


218
00:13:47.837 --> 00:13:50.037
My parents moved to Florida.

219
00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:52.438
This place is a horse-rescue ranch now.

220
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.340
People give me their old horses
and sick horses,


221
00:13:55.342 --> 00:13:57.008
and I take care of them.

222
00:14:00.811 --> 00:14:05.713
- So you stayed in Milltown?
- I stayed in Milltown.


223
00:14:05.715 --> 00:14:06.912
Why?

224
00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:09.881
Why not?

225
00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:16.752
- You married? Kids?
- No.


226
00:14:16.754 --> 00:14:18.354
No, not yet.

227
00:14:18.356 --> 00:14:23.522
I went to veterinary school,
and got busy with the ranch,


228
00:14:23.524 --> 00:14:27.491
and guess I just forgot to get
married and have children.


229
00:14:28.294 --> 00:14:30.995
Well, Dr. Sarah Standor,

230
00:14:30.997 --> 00:14:34.129
I'm glad I had the good sense
to marry you when I did.


231
00:14:34.131 --> 00:14:35.831
It was a no-brainer.

232
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:38.298
It was clear I was gonna
be very successful.


233
00:14:39.867 --> 00:14:41.635
You know,
Adam's still in town, too.


234
00:14:41.637 --> 00:14:44.735
"Three musketeers",
back together again.


235
00:14:46.272 --> 00:14:48.974
How about your fiancee?
She in town?


236
00:14:48.976 --> 00:14:51.473
I'm... I'm a big fan.
Love to meet her.


237
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:54.241
No.

238
00:14:54.243 --> 00:14:57.711
I just wanted to slip into
town to handle some business,


239
00:14:57.713 --> 00:14:59.879
slip out without any fuss.

240
00:14:59.881 --> 00:15:01.946
I don't think
that's going to happen.


241
00:15:01.948 --> 00:15:02.981
And why's that?

242
00:15:02.983 --> 00:15:04.948
Just...

243
00:15:06.158 --> 00:15:08.086
Didn't know they had
paparazzi in Milltown.


244
00:15:08.088 --> 00:15:10.654
They don't.
Those are just fans.


245
00:15:12.724 --> 00:15:15.122
Come on. I'll help you.
Come on.


246
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:20.625
Do you remember
how to ride a horse?


247
00:15:20.627 --> 00:15:23.259
Well, it's been a while,
but I think so. Why?


248
00:15:25.463 --> 00:15:28.963
All right, come on, now.

249
00:15:28.965 --> 00:15:30.498
No, no, no.
Over here.


250
00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:33.066
Hey, hey!

251
00:15:33.068 --> 00:15:35.234
It's like riding a bicycle.

252
00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:36.736
You never forget!

253
00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:42.872
- Whoa, now.
- Hang on.


254
00:15:46.577 --> 00:15:48.376
It's beautiful, isn't it?

255
00:15:48.378 --> 00:15:50.242
It's our old fort!

256
00:15:50.244 --> 00:15:51.611
Yeah!

257
00:15:51.613 --> 00:15:53.912
I'd forgotten all
about this place.


258
00:15:53.914 --> 00:15:56.315
Me, you, and Adam built this
when we were, like, 11?


259
00:15:57.549 --> 00:16:00.650
It's been a dollhouse,
it's been a playhouse,


260
00:16:00.652 --> 00:16:04.152
girls-only club, boys-only fort...

261
00:16:04.154 --> 00:16:06.387
Simpler times.

262
00:16:08.156 --> 00:16:10.789
You know, you asked me why
I stayed here in Milltown.


263
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:13.058
Well...
That's why I stayed.


264
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.693
Stayed for the "simpler times".

265
00:16:16.727 --> 00:16:19.127
Right.

266
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.961
I was thinking maybe
we could do lunch, catch up.


267
00:16:22.963 --> 00:16:25.265
"Do" lunch?

268
00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:27.932
It's just an expression.

269
00:16:27.934 --> 00:16:30.199
Well, right now, lunch for me

270
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:33.402
is a sandwich in one hand
and a hammer in the other.


271
00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:36.337
I've got about a mile of
this fence that needs mending.


272
00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:38.004
Well, you've got fences to mend

273
00:16:38.006 --> 00:16:39.972
and I'm months late
delivering a new album,


274
00:16:39.974 --> 00:16:42.474
but I think we can spare
an hour to catch up.


275
00:16:42.476 --> 00:16:45.209
- What do you say?
- Okay.


276
00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:48.110
Meet me here
tomorrow, 10:00 A.M.,


277
00:16:48.112 --> 00:16:51.180
we'll go get Adam,
and we will "do" lunch.


278
00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:53.014
Sounds great.

279
00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:54.183
See you then.

280
00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:55.749
Okay.

281
00:16:57.819 --> 00:17:00.653
Welcome home, Bradbird.

282
00:17:00.655 --> 00:17:02.620
It's not my home anymore...

283
00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:04.687
But thanks.

284
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.606
We are late.

285
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.106
Come on.

286
00:18:10.108 --> 00:18:12.905
- Nice shoes.
- They're Italian.


287
00:18:12.907 --> 00:18:17.106
- They got cowboys in Italy?
- I wasn't sure what to wear.


288
00:18:17.108 --> 00:18:19.572
You look real good.

289
00:18:19.574 --> 00:18:21.508
Thanks.

290
00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:27.373
And when we say,

291
00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:31.175
"do unto others as we
would have them do unto us,"


292
00:18:31.177 --> 00:18:34.943
we mean more than just
"follow the commandments".


293
00:18:34.944 --> 00:18:37.742
We need to treat others
with kindness...


294
00:18:38.645 --> 00:18:42.544
And with generosity of spirit.

295
00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:45.710
Just ask yourself
for one moment...


296
00:18:45.712 --> 00:18:47.946
"How would I like to be treated?"

297
00:18:47.948 --> 00:18:53.079
"What must it be like to be
in that other person's situation?"


298
00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:54.413
- Thank you for comin'.
- Thank you.


299
00:18:54.415 --> 00:18:57.013
- You have a good Sunday now.
- That's good.


300
00:18:57.015 --> 00:18:59.513
Well...

301
00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:01.879
I never thought
I'd see you back here.


302
00:19:01.881 --> 00:19:05.015
- I liked what you said in there.
- Thanks.


303
00:19:05.017 --> 00:19:09.249
But I should tell you, I got it out
of a book, so it's not totally original.


304
00:19:11.215 --> 00:19:15.883
So... lunch?
You know, I'm really craving Sushi.


305
00:19:15.885 --> 00:19:18.684
Good!
'Cause where we're going,


306
00:19:18.686 --> 00:19:21.582
it's about the only thing
they got on the menu.


307
00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:26.817
This is real nice.

308
00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:28.417
You don't remember coming here

309
00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:32.151
after church on Sundays
when we were kids?


310
00:19:32.153 --> 00:19:34.452
There's a lot about those
years I blocked out.


311
00:19:34.454 --> 00:19:38.418
Some wounds just don't heal.

312
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.918
You know, this feels
like mindful awareness.


313
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.887
What?

314
00:19:42.889 --> 00:19:45.653
That's something Catherine and I do
back in L.A.


315
00:19:45.655 --> 00:19:48.787
Pay to go to this place
that does yoga and meditation.


316
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:51.187
They teach you how to be aware
of what's in front of you,


317
00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:54.355
and let go of the past
and the future...


318
00:19:54.357 --> 00:19:57.822
Stay quiet, in the moment.

319
00:19:57.824 --> 00:20:00.220
You payin' money for that?

320
00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.289
What's so funny?

321
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.256
You're paying money
to sit still and be quiet!


322
00:20:07.257 --> 00:20:09.488
You hear that?

323
00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.923
What?

324
00:20:12.326 --> 00:20:14.290
That's silence.

325
00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:18.025
It's not yesterday's silence,
not tomorrow's silence.


326
00:20:18.027 --> 00:20:21.658
You're in it right now,
and it is free of charge.


327
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.093
I get it.

328
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.125
- So tell me about Catherine.
- She's beautiful.


329
00:20:30.127 --> 00:20:32.928
And smart.

330
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.161
She's very talented.

331
00:20:34.163 --> 00:20:37.227
Well, I know that much from reading
People Magazine at the dentist.


332
00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:39.129
Come on!
What's she really like?


333
00:20:39.131 --> 00:20:43.162
Well, she's funny,
and she's got a huge heart.


334
00:20:43.164 --> 00:20:45.095
She's been famous
since she was a kid,


335
00:20:45.097 --> 00:20:47.662
so she's used to it, you know?

336
00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:51.531
- She's taught me a lot.
- You are a lucky guy.


337
00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:53.630
I know.

338
00:20:53.632 --> 00:20:55.463
No one for you?

339
00:20:55.465 --> 00:20:59.632
There was someone once,
but not anymore.


340
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:00.930
Why?

341
00:21:00.932 --> 00:21:02.032
Well, we wanted
different things.


342
00:21:02.034 --> 00:21:04.731
I wanted a real commitment
and he wanted...


343
00:21:04.733 --> 00:21:07.333
...the opposite.

344
00:21:07.335 --> 00:21:08.499
Sorry.

345
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:12.233
Yeah, well, didn't matter.
He wasn't the one.


346
00:21:14.833 --> 00:21:19.235
- What's wrong?
- Ohh, it's not... I'm just...


347
00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.502
Waiting on a letter
that hasn't arrived yet.


348
00:21:22.768 --> 00:21:25.501
Well, thanks again
for everything.


349
00:21:25.503 --> 00:21:27.036
It was really great
to see you and Adam.


350
00:21:27.038 --> 00:21:31.035
I'll probably leave town soon,
so I'm glad we got to catch up.


351
00:21:31.037 --> 00:21:33.502
And thanks
for sending that ring.


352
00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:37.137
I'm happy you're finally
gonna use it on a real bride.


353
00:21:38.606 --> 00:21:41.104
It was great to see you,
Bradbird.


354
00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:42.237
You too.

355
00:21:43.306 --> 00:21:45.372
- Take care.
- All right.


356
00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.762
Don't worry.

357
00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:28.762
My funding's gonna
come through any day.


358
00:24:28.764 --> 00:24:32.228
I'll actually be able
to pay all these bills.


359
00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:39.197
And the kitchen has two ovens.

360
00:24:39.199 --> 00:24:40.698
Not many of these older
houses have two ovens.


361
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.597
And three bedrooms!

362
00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:46.864
- Hey! What's going on?
- You're still here?


363
00:24:46.866 --> 00:24:49.230
I'm sorry.
I thought you left days ago!


364
00:24:49.232 --> 00:24:50.966
I'm Sally Hartford,
the real estate broker.


365
00:24:50.968 --> 00:24:52.932
Mr. Fargo from
the bank sent me.


366
00:24:52.934 --> 00:24:55.066
I decided to stay a while.

367
00:24:55.068 --> 00:24:56.767
Would you mind
if we just took a little...


368
00:24:56.769 --> 00:24:58.499
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Maybe we should...


369
00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:01.301
...let Mr. Suttons
wake up a bit, and...


370
00:25:01.303 --> 00:25:02.334
That'd be nice.

371
00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:03.734
...put some clothes on.

372
00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:04.835
I don't mind!

373
00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:06.434
We'll come back later.

374
00:25:06.436 --> 00:25:08.634
- Yeah.
- Come on, now.


375
00:25:08.636 --> 00:25:09.766
- There we go.
- All right.


376
00:25:09.769 --> 00:25:11.869
- Sorry.
- Bye, now.


377
00:25:13.502 --> 00:25:15.636
I love your music.
You're my favorite singer.


378
00:25:15.638 --> 00:25:18.036
You probably don't remember me,
but we went to school together.


379
00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:19.369
I used to be Sally Brunswick?

380
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:22.436
Yeah, no...
I'm sorry.


381
00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:23.870
I don't...

382
00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:26.004
- I'm gonna go now. Okay.
- All right.


383
00:25:30.175 --> 00:25:32.705
Hey, Sarah!

384
00:25:32.707 --> 00:25:34.606
- Hey!
- Hey.


385
00:25:34.608 --> 00:25:36.172
I thought you were leaving?

386
00:25:36.174 --> 00:25:40.006
I decided to stick around here
for a few more days, write some music.


387
00:25:40.008 --> 00:25:43.373
Well, great.
Guess I'll see you around, then.


388
00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:44.773
Yeah! Yeah.

389
00:25:44.775 --> 00:25:46.840
I'll see you around.

390
00:25:46.842 --> 00:25:48.907
Okay.

391
00:25:52.432 --> 00:25:53.699
Hey!

392
00:25:54.934 --> 00:25:56.835
Those are beautiful.

393
00:25:56.837 --> 00:25:58.670
Thank you.

394
00:25:58.672 --> 00:26:01.775
Just driving 'em into town
to some of the florists.


395
00:26:01.877 --> 00:26:04.376
We got three weddings
this weekend.


396
00:26:04.408 --> 00:26:07.080
I really think it's the
flowers that make a wedding.


397
00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:09.349
Yeah.

398
00:26:10.117 --> 00:26:14.021
You know, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
"do fishin'", if you want to come.


399
00:26:15.056 --> 00:26:18.091
- You're gonna "do" fishing?
- That's just an expression.


400
00:26:18.093 --> 00:26:19.793
Is it, now?

401
00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:23.163
- You wanna come?
- Yeah, sure.


402
00:26:26.567 --> 00:26:29.736
You know, I haven't felt
this relaxed in a long time.


403
00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:33.140
I'm usually running to catch
a plane or play a concert.


404
00:26:33.142 --> 00:26:35.510
Well, that sounds exciting.

405
00:26:35.512 --> 00:26:40.281
Was, at first.
Gets old fast.


406
00:26:40.283 --> 00:26:43.017
Waking up in a different
hotel suite every morning,


407
00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:44.919
not knowing what city you're in

408
00:26:44.921 --> 00:26:47.055
until you open the door
and look at the newspaper.


409
00:26:47.057 --> 00:26:49.223
Cincinnati Post.

410
00:26:49.225 --> 00:26:51.160
The Oregonian.

411
00:26:51.162 --> 00:26:54.929
New York Times.
The L.A. Times.


412
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:58.600
Yeah, all those
first-class flights,


413
00:26:58.602 --> 00:27:01.603
and fancy hotel suites,
and big bank accounts...


414
00:27:01.605 --> 00:27:03.739
Being rich and famous
sounds rough!


415
00:27:03.741 --> 00:27:07.310
- You're making fun of me again.
- Am I?


416
00:27:07.311 --> 00:27:09.611
I thought we were
just catching up.


417
00:27:13.286 --> 00:27:15.152
Yeah, I don't know what it
is about being back here


418
00:27:15.153 --> 00:27:19.122
in the house I grew up in, but I'm
writing music like I did years ago.


419
00:27:19.124 --> 00:27:21.492
<i>I mean,
it's just flowing out of me.</i>


420
00:27:21.494 --> 00:27:24.496
That's great.
I'm so happy for you.


421
00:27:24.498 --> 00:27:26.697
<i>I'm not going to Nashville. I'm
gonna stay here and write.</i>


422
00:27:26.699 --> 00:27:29.201
<i>I miss you.</i>

423
00:27:29.203 --> 00:27:32.036
Yeah. You know,
I wish you were here,


424
00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:35.874
and I could take you out
on a long hike before dawn,


425
00:27:35.876 --> 00:27:37.943
<i>then fishing in the creek.</i>

426
00:27:37.945 --> 00:27:40.012
That sounds lovely.

427
00:27:40.014 --> 00:27:42.815
<i>I'm so excited to see you
in Italy for our wedding.</i>


428
00:27:42.817 --> 00:27:44.483
Now turn?

429
00:27:45.585 --> 00:27:48.354
Now, just you, me, and the
Italian countryside, right?


430
00:27:48.356 --> 00:27:50.089
Of course.

431
00:27:50.091 --> 00:27:52.011
I mean, there are some
minor details to consider.


432
00:27:52.459 --> 00:27:54.093
Oh, precious!

433
00:27:54.095 --> 00:27:56.128
It isn't a wedding
without flowers and a cake.


434
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.764
I've been so busy working,

435
00:27:57.766 --> 00:28:00.334
I've hired someone
to take care of all of that.


436
00:28:00.336 --> 00:28:03.135
Well, I just want to get married
in a place that reminds us


437
00:28:03.137 --> 00:28:04.604
that being together
is all that matters.


438
00:28:04.606 --> 00:28:06.772
Another turn?

439
00:28:06.774 --> 00:28:08.842
<i>Some place where the
world can't find us.</i>


440
00:28:08.844 --> 00:28:10.878
Just you...

441
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.017
Me, where the world can't find us.
That sounds... wonderful.


442
00:28:17.285 --> 00:28:18.818
<i>Good. I'll see you soon.</i>

443
00:28:55.724 --> 00:28:57.392
<i>And because
you're best friends...</i>


444
00:28:57.394 --> 00:28:59.461
And because you want
to be family forever,


445
00:28:59.463 --> 00:29:02.965
I ask you, Bradley,
will you take Sarah


446
00:29:02.967 --> 00:29:05.335
to be your wedded wife forever?

447
00:29:05.337 --> 00:29:08.306
Do you promise to care
for her and obey her...


448
00:29:08.308 --> 00:29:10.974
"Obey"?
That's in there?


449
00:29:10.976 --> 00:29:12.809
I think so.

450
00:29:16.682 --> 00:29:18.815
I guess I do.

451
00:29:18.817 --> 00:29:21.419
And I promise, too.

452
00:29:22.547 --> 00:29:24.175
Do you have a ring?

453
00:29:30.463 --> 00:29:32.163
It's really pretty.

454
00:29:32.165 --> 00:29:34.632
It's my mom's.

455
00:29:37.135 --> 00:29:38.936
Now, repeat after me...

456
00:29:38.938 --> 00:29:40.271
"With this ring... "

457
00:29:40.273 --> 00:29:41.206
With this ring...

458
00:29:41.208 --> 00:29:42.574
"I thee wed... "

459
00:29:42.576 --> 00:29:44.810
I thee wed.

460
00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:50.849
I now pronounce you married.

461
00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:52.417
You may kiss the bride.

462
00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:03.629
Memories?

463
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.533
Yeah.

464
00:30:07.535 --> 00:30:09.568
Well, it hasn't
changed much, has it?


465
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:13.206
Not a bit.

466
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.874
So how's your songwriting going?

467
00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:15.909
Great.

468
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:17.277
Good.

469
00:30:18.913 --> 00:30:22.816
I just made a decision.
This is where I want to get married.


470
00:30:24.053 --> 00:30:26.587
- You can't get married here.
- Why?


471
00:30:28.358 --> 00:30:31.959
Well, it was fine for a pretend
wedding, when we were kids,


472
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:33.228
but Catherine Mann will not
want to get married here.


473
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.396
You don't know her like I do.

474
00:30:35.398 --> 00:30:37.565
She wants to live a normal life,
but she just doesn't know how.


475
00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:39.367
Academy award-winner
Catherine Mann


476
00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:41.770
will not want to get married
in an old barn!


477
00:30:41.772 --> 00:30:43.172
I think having a wedding
out of the spotlight,


478
00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:46.006
away from the media,
is just what she needs.


479
00:30:46.008 --> 00:30:48.043
Really?

480
00:30:48.045 --> 00:30:49.612
Tell you what.

481
00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:53.949
I'll help you mend your fence,
if you help me plan my wedding.


482
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:55.550
Let me see your hands.

483
00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:58.987
When was the last time
you worked with your hands?


484
00:30:58.989 --> 00:31:01.257
I tour 200 days out of the year!

485
00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:04.360
I'm not talking about strumming
a guitar, I need a cowboy for this job!


486
00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:07.563
I am perfectly capable
of mending a fence.


487
00:31:08.432 --> 00:31:09.965
Well, we'll see.

488
00:31:09.967 --> 00:31:12.169
All right.

489
00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:14.570
I am not getting married
in a barn.


490
00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:18.040
He doesn't literally mean
an actual barn, does he?


491
00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:20.643
Yes! He's trying to protect
me from the media,


492
00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.146
offering me a chance to be...

493
00:31:22.148 --> 00:31:24.580
- Ordinary?
- Normal.


494
00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:26.216
Why would you want to be normal?

495
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:30.053
Everyone wants to be special!
Everyone wants to be you.


496
00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:33.123
I love that he's trying to
help me have a normal life.


497
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.825
Oh, yeah, that's fun.
Oh, that's fun, yes.


498
00:31:34.827 --> 00:31:37.629
He is the most thoughtful
man I have ever known.


499
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.530
He's planning
everything himself.


500
00:31:39.532 --> 00:31:41.132
He's ordering
flowers and a cake,


501
00:31:41.134 --> 00:31:43.067
his childhood best friend
is going to marry us.


502
00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:45.470
How lucky am I?

503
00:31:45.472 --> 00:31:47.438
So what are you going to do?

504
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.841
Well, I need to finish
shooting this movie,


505
00:31:49.843 --> 00:31:54.146
and he's writing music for
the first time in months,


506
00:31:54.148 --> 00:31:56.180
so everything will be fine.

507
00:31:56.182 --> 00:31:57.047
Give it to me.

508
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:58.683
- How?
- Beautiful. Beautiful.


509
00:31:58.685 --> 00:32:02.454
I'll go to Texas after we wrap.
We'll get married in the barn.


510
00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:05.190
It will be a perfect,
sweet moment,


511
00:32:05.192 --> 00:32:08.494
filled with wonderful memories
that we'll cherish forever,


512
00:32:08.496 --> 00:32:10.395
and then we'll go to Italy

513
00:32:10.397 --> 00:32:15.935
for our one-of-a-kind...
Amazing wedding.


514
00:32:15.937 --> 00:32:17.937
Are you sure you
don't want to change?


515
00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:19.071
I'm fine.

516
00:32:19.073 --> 00:32:20.673
You know, I wasn't
gonna be here long,


517
00:32:20.675 --> 00:32:21.707
so this is all that I brought.

518
00:32:21.709 --> 00:32:24.977
Well, you're gonna ruin
your Italian cowboy loafers.


519
00:32:25.913 --> 00:32:27.947
Can I at least
get you work gloves?


520
00:32:27.949 --> 00:32:32.351
- Work gloves? No, I'm good.
- Okay. Suit yourself.


521
00:32:39.962 --> 00:32:42.262
You want me to make you dinner?

522
00:32:42.264 --> 00:32:46.633
No, I was gonna head on home
and call it a day.


523
00:32:46.635 --> 00:32:48.803
Okay.

524
00:32:52.008 --> 00:32:53.475
See you tomorrow?

525
00:32:54.476 --> 00:32:56.377
Yes, you will.

526
00:33:02.718 --> 00:33:05.253
I bet you he is booking
a first-class flight


527
00:33:05.255 --> 00:33:06.687
back to Hollywood right soon?

528
00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:58.698
Nice boots.

529
00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.707
They were my dad's.

530
00:34:00.709 --> 00:34:01.777
All right!

531
00:34:02.716 --> 00:34:05.292
Let's get to work!

532
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.946
He was a good man.
You fill his boots well.


533
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.624
Thanks.

534
00:34:13.863 --> 00:34:15.804
They'd be real proud of you.

535
00:34:28.023 --> 00:34:30.936
Okay, this might sting a bit.

536
00:34:31.642 --> 00:34:32.577
Sorry.

537
00:34:32.579 --> 00:34:35.824
I'm just kidding.
It's fine, go ahead.


538
00:34:37.734 --> 00:34:39.506
You know, you did
real good today.


539
00:34:39.509 --> 00:34:42.587
Thanks.

540
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:46.704
Guess you celebrities have "people"
who do all your heavy-lifting for you?


541
00:34:46.706 --> 00:34:48.110
Oh, yeah.

542
00:34:48.112 --> 00:34:50.118
I mean, I usually have my
butlers do my fence-mending.


543
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.098
Well, I gave my staff
the night off,


544
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.344
you know, otherwise they'd be
here cooking and cleaning...


545
00:34:56.346 --> 00:34:57.952
- Right.
- ... Brushing my hair for me.


546
00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:02.940
You know, you're
pretty good at this.


547
00:35:02.942 --> 00:35:05.551
Well, I paid enough
to learn how to do it.


548
00:35:10.673 --> 00:35:12.984
You're wearing good
gloves tomorrow, okay?


549
00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:14.892
Yes, ma'am.

550
00:35:16.332 --> 00:35:19.378
- All better.
- Back in business.


551
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:23.528
I'm gonna make you some dinner.

552
00:35:34.275 --> 00:35:37.087
Hi there.
What can I get for you folks?


553
00:35:37.089 --> 00:35:41.473
Well, we will have two "Bradley
Suttons" sandwiches and two cokes.


554
00:35:41.475 --> 00:35:42.811
You know, he used to live here.

555
00:35:42.813 --> 00:35:44.920
I heard he used to be married
to a local gal.


556
00:35:44.922 --> 00:35:46.695
No way.

557
00:35:46.696 --> 00:35:48.135
I know everything there is to
know about Bradley Suttons,


558
00:35:48.137 --> 00:35:49.339
and he never married.

559
00:35:49.342 --> 00:35:51.984
Now, he is engaged
to miss Catherine Mann.


560
00:35:51.986 --> 00:35:53.221
And...

561
00:35:53.223 --> 00:35:55.666
He loves
a grilled cheese sandwich.


562
00:35:56.772 --> 00:35:59.148
- She's gonna kick herself later.
- Yeah.


563
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.194
Okay, so you're taking care
of the flowers,


564
00:36:02.196 --> 00:36:06.579
- now we need a cake and some music...
- What is Catherine's favorite flower?


565
00:36:07.584 --> 00:36:09.726
I don't... I don't know.

566
00:36:09.728 --> 00:36:12.002
You don't know your
fiancee's favorite flower?


567
00:36:12.004 --> 00:36:14.011
I've sent her flowers
plenty of times,


568
00:36:14.013 --> 00:36:16.422
but usually, my manager
handles sending them, and...


569
00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:19.501
Her manager usually
receives them for her.


570
00:36:19.503 --> 00:36:21.443
Well, how romantic.

571
00:36:21.444 --> 00:36:23.552
Yeah.

572
00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:29.343
So, which one do you like?

573
00:36:29.345 --> 00:36:32.255
I really like when they got
flowers all over them,


574
00:36:32.257 --> 00:36:33.795
and that way, everybody
gets a little flower


575
00:36:33.797 --> 00:36:35.370
with their piece of cake.

576
00:36:35.372 --> 00:36:37.912
What's Catherine's
favorite flavor?


577
00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:41.194
I don't really know.
She never orders dessert.


578
00:36:41.196 --> 00:36:44.474
Well, no, no,
of course, she doesn't.


579
00:36:44.476 --> 00:36:46.350
What's her favorite color?

580
00:36:46.352 --> 00:36:50.165
I'm not exactly sure.

581
00:36:50.167 --> 00:36:51.940
She wears a lot of black.

582
00:36:51.942 --> 00:36:55.522
Wait. You don't know
your fiancee's favorite flower,


583
00:36:55.524 --> 00:36:58.301
her favorite flavor,
or favorite color?


584
00:36:58.303 --> 00:36:59.841
Well, you'd better.

585
00:37:00.746 --> 00:37:04.527
Hey, Monica. We're gonna need
a cake for a weddin'.


586
00:37:04.529 --> 00:37:06.569
You finally decided
to settle down?


587
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:08.344
Well, who's the lucky...

588
00:37:09.382 --> 00:37:12.058
...cake?

589
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.407
Yep! Cake! 'Cause that's whatcha
do here, right, Monica?


590
00:37:17.618 --> 00:37:20.295
Yes, of course.
We do cakes!


591
00:37:20.297 --> 00:37:23.742
Good, 'cause Bradley is gonna
need a cake for his wedding.


592
00:37:23.744 --> 00:37:26.421
I am so happy
for you and Catherine.


593
00:37:26.423 --> 00:37:28.731
I think y'all are perfect
for each other.


594
00:37:28.733 --> 00:37:30.504
I always knew you'd be famous.

595
00:37:30.506 --> 00:37:33.350
So!
When is the big day?


596
00:37:33.353 --> 00:37:34.789
June 1st.

597
00:37:37.436 --> 00:37:42.555
That's only a couple of weeks away.
But, for you, I'll make it work.


598
00:37:42.558 --> 00:37:44.298
Thank you, Monica.

599
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.913
- I'll take the coconut.
- You can't have that one!


600
00:37:47.915 --> 00:37:49.252
Catherine Mann
is allergic to coconut.


601
00:37:49.254 --> 00:37:50.524
She is?

602
00:37:50.526 --> 00:37:51.896
She said so,
on the Tonight Show.


603
00:37:51.898 --> 00:37:54.039
Two years ago.

604
00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:57.220
Okay. No coconut.

605
00:37:57.222 --> 00:38:00.869
So?
How many layers do we want?


606
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:05.857
- I don't know, two?
- Two.


607
00:38:05.859 --> 00:38:07.329
Just two?

608
00:38:10.477 --> 00:38:12.484
It's perfect.

609
00:38:12.486 --> 00:38:14.929
She is so right.

610
00:38:14.931 --> 00:38:19.615
Although...
Do you think it could be taller?


611
00:38:19.617 --> 00:38:22.359
Yes.
Of course.


612
00:38:22.362 --> 00:38:24.000
But how will you get it there?

613
00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:26.110
All the way to Italy?
It will fall over.


614
00:38:26.112 --> 00:38:29.792
I will fly you on a private jet,
and you can bake it there.


615
00:38:29.794 --> 00:38:33.206
- Is that necessary?
- You only get married once.


616
00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:36.153
She's right.

617
00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:49.243
Back up.

618
00:38:49.245 --> 00:38:50.715
There you go, buddy.

619
00:38:55.169 --> 00:38:56.707
Yeah. Yeah.

620
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.883
Let's go. Yeah.

621
00:39:00.257 --> 00:39:01.561
There you go.

622
00:39:08.157 --> 00:39:10.800
No, I don't want to
leave another message.


623
00:39:10.803 --> 00:39:11.873
I just...

624
00:39:11.874 --> 00:39:14.015
Okay, fine.

625
00:39:14.017 --> 00:39:16.726
Please tell them
Sarah Standor called again.


626
00:39:16.728 --> 00:39:19.807
I'm still waiting to hear
if I got the equine rescue Grant.


627
00:39:19.808 --> 00:39:23.723
The bank's gonna foreclose on
my property in about two weeks.


628
00:39:23.725 --> 00:39:27.104
I got 18 horses who won't
have anywhere to go...


629
00:39:29.716 --> 00:39:33.398
Okay. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.


630
00:39:38.789 --> 00:39:41.130
You like living on
a ranch all alone?


631
00:39:41.132 --> 00:39:43.340
I'm not alone.

632
00:39:43.342 --> 00:39:47.927
I got my horses and my dogs
and my flowers.


633
00:39:47.929 --> 00:39:51.041
Is that enough?

634
00:39:51.043 --> 00:39:53.986
No. But I want
what my parents have,


635
00:39:53.988 --> 00:39:55.694
and that doesn't
come along every day.


636
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.237
True love?

637
00:39:58.239 --> 00:39:59.811
Oh, come on! You don't
believe in true love?


638
00:39:59.813 --> 00:40:02.088
I think you find
someone you care about.


639
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.698
Someone whose company you enjoy,

640
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.540
who likes the same
things you like,


641
00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:09.318
wants the same things you want.

642
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.867
After that,
it's hard work and compromise.


643
00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:15.444
I want someone who's gonna love
me forever no matter what,


644
00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:18.156
who wants to walk through
life leaning up against me


645
00:40:18.158 --> 00:40:20.566
so neither one of us falls.

646
00:40:20.568 --> 00:40:23.278
Well, that sounds real romantic...

647
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.454
But not very realistic.

648
00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:28.467
I agree, it is rare.

649
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:31.011
Plus, you only get
one shot at it,


650
00:40:31.013 --> 00:40:33.221
and even then, you got to be
in the right place


651
00:40:33.223 --> 00:40:35.397
to recognize it and choose
it and fight for it.


652
00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:40.051
So this, magical relationship,
it only happens once in a lifetime?


653
00:40:40.053 --> 00:40:41.523
Yup.

654
00:40:41.525 --> 00:40:45.473
And you got to be in the right place
at the right time, or you miss it?


655
00:40:45.475 --> 00:40:46.845
Yep.

656
00:40:46.847 --> 00:40:48.720
I think you've read
too many romance novels.


657
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:52.939
Maybe, but I'm not
gonna settle for less.


658
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.716
Well, I hope you get
your happily-ever-after.


659
00:40:55.718 --> 00:40:57.925
You deserve it.

660
00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:03.149
So you're really
gonna get married here?


661
00:41:03.151 --> 00:41:05.158
Well...

662
00:41:04.434 --> 00:41:06.699
We're gonna have to do
some serious cleaning up.


663
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:08.836
True.

664
00:41:10.873 --> 00:41:12.941
You got that?

665
00:41:16.712 --> 00:41:17.745
Come on.

666
00:41:18.817 --> 00:41:19.781
Come here.

667
00:41:19.783 --> 00:41:21.350
- Hey, hey!
- Come here.


668
00:41:21.352 --> 00:41:23.051
Go!

669
00:41:23.054 --> 00:41:24.319
I win.

670
00:41:25.855 --> 00:41:26.921
Agh!

671
00:41:26.923 --> 00:41:28.057
Are you kidding me?

672
00:41:31.996 --> 00:41:33.062
How do you like it?

673
00:41:34.298 --> 00:41:35.297
Take that!

674
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.537
Now, why did you bring me
all the way out here?


675
00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:47.474
Well, you've been
working so hard,


676
00:41:47.476 --> 00:41:50.881
I thought we'd take a night off
and go to the movies.


677
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:53.321
- The movies?
- Cowboy style.


678
00:41:53.323 --> 00:41:54.857
Lie back.

679
00:41:54.859 --> 00:41:57.196
All right.

680
00:41:57.198 --> 00:41:59.100
This is one of my favorites.

681
00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:03.543
It stars the big and little Dipper
in one of their best adventures.


682
00:42:03.545 --> 00:42:06.382
I love this movie.

683
00:42:06.384 --> 00:42:09.156
I remember watching
it when I was a kid.


684
00:42:09.158 --> 00:42:11.494
This is the sequel.

685
00:42:15.972 --> 00:42:20.013
You know, I've been listening to you
play your new songs at night.


686
00:42:20.015 --> 00:42:22.185
They sound real good.

687
00:42:22.187 --> 00:42:23.220
They remind me a lot
of the ones you wrote


688
00:42:23.222 --> 00:42:24.422
when you were
first starting out.


689
00:42:24.424 --> 00:42:29.667
You know, that take you on a journey,
make you feel something.


690
00:42:29.669 --> 00:42:30.971
You really think so?

691
00:42:30.973 --> 00:42:33.944
Well, why would I say it
if it wasn't true?


692
00:42:33.946 --> 00:42:37.318
The world I live in
is full of people


693
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.623
who tell me what
they think I want to hear.


694
00:42:39.625 --> 00:42:42.629
I'll never do that.

695
00:42:42.631 --> 00:42:44.466
Good.

696
00:42:48.377 --> 00:42:51.683
So, can I tell you something
truthfully?


697
00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:55.123
Sure.

698
00:42:55.125 --> 00:42:58.164
- That hat.
- What about it?


699
00:42:58.166 --> 00:43:00.436
Well, you think it makes you
look like a cowboy, but...


700
00:43:00.438 --> 00:43:01.738
I love this hat, okay?

701
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.808
It's new.

702
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.310
My manager, Hank,
sent it to me for my tour.


703
00:43:04.312 --> 00:43:05.781
Okay, well, that's the problem.

704
00:43:05.784 --> 00:43:07.619
A real cowboy would
never wear a new hat.


705
00:43:07.621 --> 00:43:09.423
Hey...

706
00:43:09.425 --> 00:43:11.192
What are you doing?

707
00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:17.541
That's better.

708
00:43:17.543 --> 00:43:19.411
Oh, man.

709
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.709
You know, this was
a good place to grow up.


710
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:35.581
Well, I'm glad
you remember that.


711
00:43:35.583 --> 00:43:37.952
You and Catherine talked about
where you want to settle down,


712
00:43:37.954 --> 00:43:38.920
raise your children?

713
00:43:38.922 --> 00:43:41.527
I don't know if Catherine
wants to have children.


714
00:43:41.529 --> 00:43:42.529
Do you?

715
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:43.764
Sure.

716
00:43:43.766 --> 00:43:45.135
Well...

717
00:43:46.338 --> 00:43:48.509
You're getting married,

718
00:43:48.511 --> 00:43:50.679
but you haven't discussed
whether you want a family?


719
00:43:52.585 --> 00:43:54.556
Well, celebrities
are an odd breed.


720
00:43:54.558 --> 00:43:59.567
- I am not a celebrity.
- Yes, clearly.


721
00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.448
- I love this place.
- Mint chip, right?


722
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.188
- Very good.
- Come on.


723
00:44:11.962 --> 00:44:14.533
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, can I get your autograph?


724
00:44:14.535 --> 00:44:16.504
How many guests
are you thinking of having?


725
00:44:16.506 --> 00:44:17.607
I hadn't thought about it.

726
00:44:18.508 --> 00:44:22.303
I work with a lot of people, but
I don't have a lot of time to socialize.


727
00:44:24.623 --> 00:44:27.729
I bet she's got some fancy
designer making her a gown.


728
00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:30.602
You're probably right.

729
00:44:30.604 --> 00:44:34.343
- Come on, let's get you a tuxedo.
- All right.


730
00:44:36.048 --> 00:44:39.187
Well, you are going to make
a very fancy groom.


731
00:44:39.189 --> 00:44:42.829
Yeah, I don't know.
Something doesn't feel right.


732
00:44:42.831 --> 00:44:46.536
You know, you're right.
Something is missing.


733
00:44:47.374 --> 00:44:49.810
Hold on.

734
00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:51.047
Yup.

735
00:44:52.584 --> 00:44:53.819
There.

736
00:44:53.821 --> 00:44:56.626
- Now you're all set.
- Oh, yeah.


737
00:44:56.628 --> 00:44:58.397
Now I feel good.

738
00:44:59.869 --> 00:45:02.038
Looks good.

739
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.310
Do you have your dress yet?

740
00:45:04.311 --> 00:45:06.148
Oh, no. No, I'm...

741
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.254
Don't say another word.
I have the perfect dress for you.


742
00:45:09.256 --> 00:45:11.359
Well...

743
00:45:16.472 --> 00:45:18.374
Thank you.

744
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.273
She's right, it's perfect.

745
00:45:33.275 --> 00:45:37.751
If I ever do get married,
this is the dress I'm gonna wear.


746
00:45:39.121 --> 00:45:40.623
You look like a Princess.

747
00:45:42.228 --> 00:45:43.964
You make a lovely
bride and groom.


748
00:45:43.966 --> 00:45:47.839
- No, no, we're not getting married.
- Not again anyway.


749
00:45:47.841 --> 00:45:49.276
We got married years ago.

750
00:45:49.278 --> 00:45:50.245
Yeah.

751
00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:51.347
I see.

752
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:54.354
Yup, I'm marrying a new bride.

753
00:45:54.356 --> 00:45:57.226
You bring your old bride to the store
to try on a dress for your new bride?


754
00:45:57.228 --> 00:46:00.232
- That's right.
- Well, well, well.


755
00:46:08.352 --> 00:46:11.625
Now, God says
to love your enemies.


756
00:46:11.627 --> 00:46:14.765
Now, that has to be one of the
hardest commandments on the list...


757
00:46:16.204 --> 00:46:20.311
...these days, what with the
news and Internet full of...


758
00:46:22.685 --> 00:46:23.953
Well, I think what's
most important in life


759
00:46:23.955 --> 00:46:27.327
is that we all
paint our houses purple.


760
00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:31.635
I believe we'll be better people
if we paint our houses purple,


761
00:46:31.637 --> 00:46:35.278
with...
Pink polka dots, too.


762
00:46:36.013 --> 00:46:37.181
Excuse me.

763
00:46:37.183 --> 00:46:38.651
Can I... can I have
your attention, y'all?


764
00:46:38.653 --> 00:46:41.557
So sorry, pastor Adam, I just
have an announcement to make.


765
00:46:42.762 --> 00:46:46.135
Bradley Suttons, homegrown
country music star,


766
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:48.005
would like to invite you all
to attend his wedding


767
00:46:48.007 --> 00:46:49.910
to movie star Catherine Mann.

768
00:46:49.912 --> 00:46:53.852
It's gonna be held on June 1st
in my barn.


769
00:46:53.854 --> 00:46:55.822
So until then, let's give
Bradley some privacy


770
00:46:55.825 --> 00:47:01.034
and let's get back to pastor Adam,
and his beautiful sermon, okay?


771
00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:03.573
Thank you, Sarah.

772
00:47:05.079 --> 00:47:07.248
You just invited

773
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.453
They aren't strangers.

774
00:47:09.455 --> 00:47:10.956
Most of them have known you
since you were a kid,


775
00:47:10.958 --> 00:47:13.461
and they all loved you
before you were a big star.


776
00:47:19.643 --> 00:47:22.414
It was real nice of you to
invite the town to your wedding.


777
00:47:23.988 --> 00:47:27.460
It just seemed like
the right thing to do.


778
00:47:27.462 --> 00:47:29.497
I think being home
has been healing for you.


779
00:47:29.499 --> 00:47:33.271
Opening your heart will
lead to a peaceful life.


780
00:47:34.676 --> 00:47:36.246
I think you're right.

781
00:47:36.248 --> 00:47:37.949
How are the wedding
plans coming?


782
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.993
Well... we're done.

783
00:47:42.995 --> 00:47:46.067
I'm sure looking forward
to meeting Catherine.


784
00:47:47.137 --> 00:47:48.874
You must love her very much.

785
00:47:50.478 --> 00:47:51.246
I do.

786
00:47:52.884 --> 00:47:53.982
I do.

787
00:47:56.759 --> 00:47:57.759
Hey, now!

788
00:47:57.761 --> 00:47:58.762
Hey!

789
00:48:01.102 --> 00:48:02.270
Here she is!

790
00:48:02.272 --> 00:48:03.505
Come on, baby.

791
00:48:03.507 --> 00:48:07.046
That's a big one! Yes!

792
00:48:12.627 --> 00:48:13.829
You did it!

793
00:48:14.899 --> 00:48:15.967
Nice work!

794
00:48:26.691 --> 00:48:28.628
You learn fast.

795
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.768
I think that whole country star
persona is a put-on.


796
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.605
You're really just a cowboy
deep down.


797
00:48:35.042 --> 00:48:37.280
Well, my dad was.

798
00:48:37.282 --> 00:48:40.019
I think that's where
my life was headed before...


799
00:48:40.021 --> 00:48:42.258
He and my mom died.

800
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.025
I guess we never know what life's
going to throw at us, do we?


801
00:48:45.934 --> 00:48:48.204
You know,
when I moved to Nashville,


802
00:48:48.206 --> 00:48:51.178
living in the city
was such a change,


803
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.316
I don't think I ever really
got used to it.


804
00:48:53.318 --> 00:48:57.625
Your roots are
always your roots.


805
00:48:58.728 --> 00:49:02.503
You know, I think I forgot what
being home was supposed to feel like.


806
00:49:02.505 --> 00:49:06.144
You know, I spent so much time
trying to forget this place, but...


807
00:49:06.146 --> 00:49:07.814
Being here back here,

808
00:49:07.816 --> 00:49:10.052
with you,

809
00:49:10.054 --> 00:49:12.557
it's bringing it all back.

810
00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:15.197
This is home.

811
00:49:21.746 --> 00:49:24.919
I don't know why
I told you all that.


812
00:49:24.921 --> 00:49:27.658
I mean, I never... I never
really talk about this stuff.


813
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:31.543
Thank you.

814
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.543
For helping me find my way
back to who I was.


815
00:49:39.418 --> 00:49:42.123
You're going to need music
for your wedding.


816
00:49:42.418 --> 00:49:43.323
Yeah.

817
00:49:44.364 --> 00:49:48.103
There's a great band in town,
and they're playing tomorrow night


818
00:49:48.105 --> 00:49:49.473
if you want to go see 'em.

819
00:49:50.743 --> 00:49:54.851
That'd be great.

820
00:50:17.751 --> 00:50:20.321
- Evening.
- Hi.


821
00:50:22.024 --> 00:50:23.024
You all set?

822
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.132
You clean up real good
for a cowgirl.


823
00:50:28.134 --> 00:50:29.835
Well, thank you, kind sir.

824
00:50:29.837 --> 00:50:32.305
These are my Saturday
go-to-town boots.


825
00:50:32.307 --> 00:50:34.340
Well, let's get.

826
00:50:42.086 --> 00:50:44.923
Hi. How are ya?

827
00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:47.894
How you doing, Adam?

828
00:50:47.896 --> 00:50:49.263
Go for a tour around the floor?

829
00:50:49.265 --> 00:50:50.366
Maybe after a few.

830
00:50:50.368 --> 00:50:51.733
- Let me take that.
- Thank you.


831
00:50:55.274 --> 00:50:56.941
Thank you very much!

832
00:50:56.943 --> 00:50:59.211
Thank you!

833
00:51:06.523 --> 00:51:07.657
They're good.

834
00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:10.795
You're gonna need, you know,
romantic dancing music, too.


835
00:51:10.797 --> 00:51:14.234
- You want to dance?
- Yeah, okay.


836
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.540
- Do you dance?
- I try.


837
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:24.856
Are you ready? Because
I'm gonna spin you.


838
00:51:24.891 --> 00:51:26.054
You have moves?

839
00:51:27.223 --> 00:51:28.622
Well.

840
00:51:28.624 --> 00:51:29.590
Oh, yeah.

841
00:51:29.592 --> 00:51:31.125
That was a surprise.

842
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:21.867
Thank you!

843
00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:23.303
Now, we've got a very special
treat for y'all tonight.


844
00:52:23.604 --> 00:52:27.141
We have country superstar
and Milltown's own


845
00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.304
Bradley Suttons in the house!

846
00:52:31.884 --> 00:52:34.420
I'd like to invite him up
to join the band for a song.


847
00:52:35.758 --> 00:52:37.690
Come on up!

848
00:52:40.598 --> 00:52:42.064
Okay, boys.

849
00:52:44.102 --> 00:52:45.870
"Love don't die easy"?

850
00:52:45.872 --> 00:52:47.772
Howdy, y'all.

851
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.276
It's...

852
00:52:50.278 --> 00:52:53.214
It's good to be home.

853
00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.848
What are you doing, Sarah?

854
00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.685
What are you talking about?

855
00:53:40.687 --> 00:53:42.487
Come on, I've
known you a long time.


856
00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:46.160
You're falling in love
with him, aren't you?


857
00:53:46.162 --> 00:53:49.496
He's helping me on my ranch,
I'm helping him plan his wedding.


858
00:53:49.498 --> 00:53:51.167
Exactly.
His wedding.


859
00:53:51.469 --> 00:53:53.870
He's marrying somebody else,
he's leaving this town.


860
00:53:54.272 --> 00:53:55.739
I know.

861
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:58.443
I care about you, Sarah.

862
00:53:58.445 --> 00:54:01.682
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.


863
00:55:13.257 --> 00:55:14.924
Sarah?

864
00:55:14.926 --> 00:55:17.194
What happened to you last night?
I waited...


865
00:55:20.803 --> 00:55:21.868
Good morning.

866
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.038
Mr. Fargo,
I wasn't expecting you.


867
00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.543
Well, I came by to deliver
some good news.


868
00:55:26.545 --> 00:55:28.111
We got a solid offer
on your house.


869
00:55:28.113 --> 00:55:31.583
They want to move in right away.
It's an all-cash offer.


870
00:55:31.585 --> 00:55:33.486
I'm not sure I want to sell.

871
00:55:33.488 --> 00:55:35.823
I was thinking
I might just keep the house.


872
00:55:35.825 --> 00:55:37.791
Well, that's good news.

873
00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:41.364
Yeah, I'm beginning to see how
important it is to hold on to your roots.


874
00:55:41.366 --> 00:55:44.201
Well, maybe you can talk some
sense into your neighbor.


875
00:55:44.203 --> 00:55:45.503
She's going to
lose her ranch soon


876
00:55:45.505 --> 00:55:47.941
if she doesn't figure out a way
to pay her mortgage.


877
00:55:47.943 --> 00:55:49.577
What do you mean?

878
00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:51.979
Well, she's waiting for
some funding to come in,


879
00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:54.016
but she's way behind
on her payments.


880
00:55:54.018 --> 00:55:57.086
The people leave her their sick
or old horses to take care of,


881
00:55:57.088 --> 00:55:59.191
they don't pay their bills,
and she gets stuck.


882
00:56:00.327 --> 00:56:04.699
And her flower business isn't
enough to carry the ranch.


883
00:56:04.701 --> 00:56:07.469
Is that right?

884
00:56:09.474 --> 00:56:15.081
Morning.

885
00:56:15.083 --> 00:56:17.583
Last night was fun.

886
00:56:17.585 --> 00:56:19.420
I tried to find you
when I was leaving, but...


887
00:56:19.422 --> 00:56:21.156
Oh, yeah, sorry,
I had to duck out.


888
00:56:21.158 --> 00:56:23.760
I... I was exhausted,

889
00:56:23.762 --> 00:56:26.031
and I got so much work
to get done.


890
00:56:26.033 --> 00:56:29.202
Well, I'll go get my tools
and get to work on the fences.


891
00:56:29.204 --> 00:56:31.806
No, you take the day off.

892
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:35.811
Is everything okay?

893
00:56:35.813 --> 00:56:39.283
Everything's fine.
I just... got to get this done.


894
00:56:44.959 --> 00:56:46.695
You know, I wanted to thank you

895
00:56:46.697 --> 00:56:49.364
for looking after my yard and
my flowers all these years.


896
00:56:49.366 --> 00:56:51.100
It's not a problem.

897
00:56:51.102 --> 00:56:53.538
You and your family
were great neighbors to us.


898
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.112
Well, I wanted to pay you
for the work that you did.


899
00:56:59.114 --> 00:57:00.280
I feel like it's only fair...

900
00:57:00.282 --> 00:57:02.918
No, no,
I know what you're up to.


901
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.354
You've been talking
to James Fargo?


902
00:57:07.827 --> 00:57:09.628
You don't have to
worry about me.


903
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.633
I got my letter,
and my funding came through,


904
00:57:12.635 --> 00:57:15.938
so I'm going to be just fine.

905
00:57:18.242 --> 00:57:20.812
Well... that's good news.

906
00:57:22.115 --> 00:57:24.083
Okay, well, gotta
get back to this.


907
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.487
All right, then.

908
00:57:27.489 --> 00:57:29.557
I'll see you later.

909
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:44.514
Allen, grace...

910
00:57:47.519 --> 00:57:49.388
Hello!

911
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:51.256
So...

912
00:57:51.258 --> 00:57:53.562
Are you still planning on
going to Texas this weekend?


913
00:57:53.563 --> 00:57:55.330
I am.

914
00:57:55.332 --> 00:57:58.235
I'm actually really excited
to see where Bradley came from.


915
00:57:58.237 --> 00:58:01.638
Someone sent me this
early this morning.


916
00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:04.944
Who is this?

917
00:58:04.946 --> 00:58:09.251
According to the article,
Sarah Standor, a childhood friend.


918
00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.722
The girl who sent
the letter and the ring?


919
00:58:12.724 --> 00:58:14.892
The nerdy girl with braids?

920
00:58:14.894 --> 00:58:18.932
She aged well.
You need to go to Texas. Now.


921
00:58:30.025 --> 00:58:31.024
Hey.

922
00:58:34.115 --> 00:58:35.946
Are you avoiding me?

923
00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:39.076
No, I've just been real busy.

924
00:58:41.874 --> 00:58:43.704
The fences look good.

925
00:58:44.573 --> 00:58:46.604
I gotta get going.
I've got a flower delivery.


926
00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:49.602
- I'll come with you.
- No, I got it.


927
00:58:49.605 --> 00:58:51.467
I decided to keep the house.

928
00:58:51.469 --> 00:58:53.765
I'm not selling it.

929
00:58:56.398 --> 00:59:00.994
Why?

930
00:59:00.996 --> 00:59:02.458
I think you helped me
remember that.


931
00:59:05.024 --> 00:59:07.188
Do you think Catherine
will like it here?


932
00:59:08.556 --> 00:59:10.519
Well, I don't see why not.

933
00:59:10.521 --> 00:59:14.882
You know, it's beautiful and calm,
people are friendly, the air is clean.


934
00:59:21.044 --> 00:59:22.711
Hey!

935
00:59:22.713 --> 00:59:24.108
What's going on with you?

936
00:59:25.042 --> 00:59:26.507
You want the truth?

937
00:59:26.509 --> 00:59:29.071
'Cause like you said,
you've got a lot people in your life


938
00:59:29.073 --> 00:59:30.437
who tell you what they think
you want to hear,


939
00:59:30.439 --> 00:59:33.968
- ... so maybe you like it that way.
- I'd rather hear the truth.


940
00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:36.634
Okay, well, you're about to marry
a woman you barely know.


941
00:59:36.636 --> 00:59:39.996
You don't know her favorite color,
you don't know her favorite flower.


942
00:59:39.998 --> 00:59:42.660
You don't even know
if she wants to have a family.


943
00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:45.492
I mean, it seems to me you
know nothing about her at all.


944
00:59:45.494 --> 00:59:46.558
No, I know everything
I need to know.


945
00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.722
Why are you here planning
your wedding without her?


946
00:59:48.724 --> 00:59:53.020
Why am I here making all
decisions she should be making?


947
00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:54.184
Where is she?

948
00:59:54.186 --> 00:59:56.951
I told you,
she's... she's busy filming.


949
00:59:58.183 --> 01:00:00.848
Okay, look,

950
01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.780
you and I have been friends
a long time,


951
01:00:03.782 --> 01:00:05.444
so I'm gonna shoot you straight.

952
01:00:05.446 --> 01:00:07.442
All right.

953
01:00:07.444 --> 01:00:08.608
Okay.

954
01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:11.574
You can't marry Catherine Mann.

955
01:00:11.576 --> 01:00:14.870
You don't love her.

956
01:00:17.336 --> 01:00:20.101
I do.
I do love her.


957
01:00:21.365 --> 01:00:23.098
Why did you kiss me?

958
01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:26.761
I shouldn't have done that.
All right?


959
01:00:26.763 --> 01:00:30.826
I'm sorry, I just... I just got
caught up in the music and the...


960
01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:33.023
And the moment.

961
01:00:34.456 --> 01:00:37.020
So, that's all that was?

962
01:00:37.022 --> 01:00:39.185
You got caught up in the moment?

963
01:00:41.685 --> 01:00:43.550
Yeah.

964
01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:51.476
Look, I get
that you're scared, okay?


965
01:00:51.478 --> 01:00:53.907
You got your heart broken as a kid,

966
01:00:53.909 --> 01:00:57.404
and you are afraid to love
too much ever again...


967
01:00:57.406 --> 01:00:59.970
Well, you know what,
love is scary!


968
01:00:59.972 --> 01:01:04.067
It is terrifying to put your heart
out there, but you do it anyway.


969
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:05.998
You do it in spite of the fear,

970
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.960
because a life without love,
that's just half a life.


971
01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:12.794
And you don't get married 'cause
you like the same things,


972
01:01:12.796 --> 01:01:14.892
and 'cause you live
similar lifestyles.


973
01:01:14.894 --> 01:01:15.958
You get married

974
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.722
because you can't stand the
thought of not being together.


975
01:01:19.724 --> 01:01:23.452
You get married because you love the
other person with your whole heart!


976
01:01:24.353 --> 01:01:27.215
No, that's...
That's just a fantasy.


977
01:01:28.748 --> 01:01:31.280
Maybe it is.

978
01:01:31.282 --> 01:01:34.277
But I don't think
you should settle for less.


979
01:01:35.977 --> 01:01:38.607
You know, just 'cause you
knew me when I was a kid,


980
01:01:38.609 --> 01:01:40.772
it doesn't mean you know me now.

981
01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:48.866
Yeah, I guess you're right.

982
01:01:50.366 --> 01:01:55.093
Look, you and me had a deal.
Okay?


983
01:01:55.095 --> 01:01:58.924
You'd help me mend my fences, and
I'd help you plan your wedding, so...


984
01:01:58.926 --> 01:02:00.257
I guess we're done.

985
01:02:48.156 --> 01:02:51.485
<i>This is me. 
Who are you?</i>

986
01:02:51.487 --> 01:02:54.916
Hey, Catherine,
it's, it's me.


987
01:02:54.918 --> 01:02:59.513
Call me when you get this.
We need to talk.


988
01:03:13.537 --> 01:03:14.699
Catherine!

989
01:03:15.935 --> 01:03:17.398
You're here!

990
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.565
Well, we're getting married
in a couple of days.


991
01:03:18.567 --> 01:03:21.331
I thought it was time
I reclaim my cowboy.


992
01:03:24.461 --> 01:03:26.560
Let me get your bags.

993
01:03:28.459 --> 01:03:29.889
All right.

994
01:03:29.891 --> 01:03:31.955
I thought you were
selling this place.


995
01:03:31.957 --> 01:03:34.752
Wasn't that whole reason
of coming here?


996
01:03:34.754 --> 01:03:40.014
Well, I was, but then I got here, and
realized maybe I should hold onto it.


997
01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.147
Why?

998
01:03:42.149 --> 01:03:44.645
Well, I grew up here.
This is my home.


999
01:03:45.745 --> 01:03:47.476
Listen, I'm so glad you're here.

1000
01:03:47.478 --> 01:03:50.707
I've learned so much about myself
over the last couple of weeks.


1001
01:03:50.709 --> 01:03:52.939
What are you wearing?

1002
01:03:52.941 --> 01:03:57.468
- Just some old clothes. Work clothes.
- Work?


1003
01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:00.799
Look, I thought we could keep
this house as a home base


1004
01:04:00.801 --> 01:04:02.364
for when we're not working.

1005
01:04:02.366 --> 01:04:03.697
Then we could spend time
here with our children.


1006
01:04:03.699 --> 01:04:06.195
Teach them how to fish
and ride horses.


1007
01:04:06.197 --> 01:04:08.892
Give them something real,
something out of the spotlight.


1008
01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:11.726
Our... our children?

1009
01:04:11.728 --> 01:04:14.422
You want to have children,
don't you?


1010
01:04:14.424 --> 01:04:16.487
I mean, I know we never
discussed it, but...


1011
01:04:16.489 --> 01:04:19.385
We love each other
and we're getting married.


1012
01:04:19.387 --> 01:04:23.061
We have a lifetime to learn everything
we need to know about each other.


1013
01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.478
I want what you want.

1014
01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.274
So, why don't I get changed,

1015
01:04:32.276 --> 01:04:35.273
and you can make
reservations someplace nice,


1016
01:04:35.275 --> 01:04:39.104
and we'll go out
on the town and celebrate.


1017
01:04:39.106 --> 01:04:40.736
Well, there's a diner in town,

1018
01:04:40.738 --> 01:04:42.735
but there aren't any fancy
restaurants close by.


1019
01:04:42.737 --> 01:04:47.831
- Where do people eat?
- At home. They cook.


1020
01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:51.361
Look...

1021
01:04:51.363 --> 01:04:53.226
It's gonna be great, all right?

1022
01:04:53.228 --> 01:04:54.458
We're gonna get up early
tomorrow morning,


1023
01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:57.823
I'm gonna take you on that hike,
then we can go fishin'.


1024
01:04:57.825 --> 01:05:00.420
You're gonna love it, I promise.

1025
01:05:00.422 --> 01:05:05.184
As long as we're together,
everything is perfect.


1026
01:05:08.315 --> 01:05:12.879
Have you, seen your neighbor,
the one who sent you the ring?


1027
01:05:12.881 --> 01:05:14.477
Sarah?

1028
01:05:14.479 --> 01:05:18.640
Yeah, she... she has a horse
rescue ranch next door.


1029
01:05:18.642 --> 01:05:20.540
Wonderful.

1030
01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.904
She depends on funding
to keep it running.


1031
01:05:22.906 --> 01:05:24.602
I'm not sure she got it.

1032
01:05:24.604 --> 01:05:27.367
I offered to help, but
she's too stubborn to let me.


1033
01:05:27.369 --> 01:05:29.365
You're such a good man.

1034
01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:30.699
The bank is threatening
to sell her ranch


1035
01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:32.563
if she doesn't come up with
the money soon.


1036
01:05:32.565 --> 01:05:34.128
What a shame.

1037
01:05:35.163 --> 01:05:36.261
She's a great girl.

1038
01:05:36.263 --> 01:05:38.992
She helped us plan
our whole wedding.


1039
01:05:41.857 --> 01:05:43.588
Hello.

1040
01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.819
Yes, the Sun Ranch.

1041
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:48.517
No, next door.
The yellow house, red barn.


1042
01:05:49.586 --> 01:05:51.615
Rural route 8, Milltown.

1043
01:05:51.617 --> 01:05:54.279
Great.
Thank you.


1044
01:05:54.882 --> 01:05:57.010
What was that all about?

1045
01:05:57.012 --> 01:05:58.410
I just ordered a few things

1046
01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:00.707
to make our wedding
a little more comfortable.


1047
01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:02.907
I told you I'd take care of it.

1048
01:06:02.909 --> 01:06:05.506
You know, I ordered
a cake and flowers...


1049
01:06:05.508 --> 01:06:07.136
And I'm sure you did
a great job.


1050
01:06:07.138 --> 01:06:10.866
But we'll have
our rehearsal dinner,


1051
01:06:10.868 --> 01:06:15.662
then we'll get to Italy,
and back to our real lives.


1052
01:06:17.697 --> 01:06:19.660
All right.

1053
01:06:26.889 --> 01:06:29.086
You know, I love this place.

1054
01:06:29.088 --> 01:06:31.118
I can see that.

1055
01:06:33.117 --> 01:06:34.250
So...

1056
01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:41.111
How long do we actually
need to stay out here for?


1057
01:06:41.113 --> 01:06:42.642
You'll know when you're done.

1058
01:06:44.177 --> 01:06:46.072
Okay, I'm done.

1059
01:06:47.573 --> 01:06:49.271
Hey!

1060
01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:51.302
Catherine!

1061
01:06:51.304 --> 01:06:52.835
Get me outta here!

1062
01:06:52.837 --> 01:06:54.701
Help!

1063
01:06:54.703 --> 01:06:55.800
Get me outta here!

1064
01:06:57.732 --> 01:06:59.662
You all right?

1065
01:06:59.664 --> 01:07:00.596
I suppose.

1066
01:07:00.598 --> 01:07:02.293
I got you.

1067
01:07:02.295 --> 01:07:03.327
Sit down here.

1068
01:07:03.329 --> 01:07:05.092
I can't believe
you made me do that.


1069
01:07:09.224 --> 01:07:11.088
Let's take these off of you.

1070
01:07:17.485 --> 01:07:19.981
Cooper, we got it.

1071
01:07:22.446 --> 01:07:24.212
Let's see...

1072
01:07:30.841 --> 01:07:32.473
Oh, no.

1073
01:07:50.907 --> 01:07:53.977
We're gonna get you better
in no time.


1074
01:07:56.847 --> 01:07:58.014
Good morning!

1075
01:07:58.016 --> 01:08:00.450
Catherine.

1076
01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:02.287
Hi!

1077
01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:04.388
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm a huge fan.


1078
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.190
Oh, sorry.

1079
01:08:06.192 --> 01:08:07.424
Thanks.

1080
01:08:07.428 --> 01:08:10.129
Bradley told me what you're
doing here, rescuing horses.


1081
01:08:10.131 --> 01:08:12.065
I'm... very impressed.

1082
01:08:13.668 --> 01:08:14.866
I love the work.

1083
01:08:14.868 --> 01:08:18.639
It's beautiful here. I can see
why Bradley likes it so much.


1084
01:08:19.741 --> 01:08:24.546
He romanticizes what it would be like
to settle down and raise a family here,


1085
01:08:24.548 --> 01:08:27.750
- ... but that will never happen.
- No?


1086
01:08:27.852 --> 01:08:31.320
Well, once he's back on tour,
jet-setting around the world,


1087
01:08:31.322 --> 01:08:35.292
like he did before,
and never look back.


1088
01:08:35.294 --> 01:08:40.430
He has a gift, something he needs
to share with the world.


1089
01:08:40.432 --> 01:08:42.300
You understand that, right?

1090
01:08:43.333 --> 01:08:45.469
I do.

1091
01:08:45.471 --> 01:08:48.807
He is extraordinary.

1092
01:08:48.809 --> 01:08:51.242
He's very concerned about you.

1093
01:08:51.244 --> 01:08:53.079
He told me about
your financial troubles,


1094
01:08:53.081 --> 01:08:56.549
and I have a friend in the
business, wonderful man.


1095
01:08:56.551 --> 01:08:58.518
There's his name and address.

1096
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.254
He takes in horses
and other animals


1097
01:09:00.256 --> 01:09:02.623
that have retired from
working in TV and films.


1098
01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:07.229
I called him, thinking maybe
he could help, and he can.


1099
01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:10.230
He has room to take your horses
if you need a place to put them.


1100
01:09:10.232 --> 01:09:13.701
In fact, he'd like to talk to you

1101
01:09:13.703 --> 01:09:18.442
about working on his ranch in
California, if you might be interested.


1102
01:09:18.444 --> 01:09:21.077
- That's amazing.
- It's serendipitous.


1103
01:09:21.079 --> 01:09:25.315
I think you should grab the
opportunity and talk to him right away.


1104
01:09:26.217 --> 01:09:27.551
- Okay.
- I know you'd like him.


1105
01:09:27.553 --> 01:09:29.553
Well...

1106
01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:36.526
I hope you'll accept this
as a gift from Bradley and me.


1107
01:09:36.528 --> 01:09:41.767
We want to thank you for working
so hard to put our wedding together.


1108
01:09:43.171 --> 01:09:48.073
I had my assistant book you
on a flight for tomorrow morning.


1109
01:09:50.746 --> 01:09:53.347
This is very sweet of you.

1110
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:55.683
You'll have to miss the wedding,

1111
01:09:55.685 --> 01:09:59.287
but that's not as important
as saving your horses, is it?


1112
01:09:59.289 --> 01:10:03.291
No.
No, of course not.


1113
01:10:03.293 --> 01:10:05.360
Thank you very much
for doing this.


1114
01:10:05.362 --> 01:10:09.199
A friend of Bradley's
is a friend of mine.


1115
01:10:13.038 --> 01:10:14.037
Catherine!

1116
01:10:15.507 --> 01:10:19.711
- What's your favorite flower?
- Yellow roses.


1117
01:10:19.713 --> 01:10:20.812
Why?

1118
01:10:22.348 --> 01:10:23.683
No reason.

1119
01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:41.769
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- Glad you called.


1120
01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:42.871
You okay?

1121
01:10:42.873 --> 01:10:45.038
Yeah.

1122
01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.379
How do people look
when they're... in love?


1123
01:10:49.381 --> 01:10:52.716
And how do they know
they've chosen the right person,


1124
01:10:52.718 --> 01:10:55.553
the one they're supposed to
be with forever?


1125
01:10:57.555 --> 01:10:59.090
Well, the bride gets
this look in her eyes


1126
01:10:59.092 --> 01:11:00.459
when she knows she's doing
the right thing.


1127
01:11:00.461 --> 01:11:02.527
She walks into the church,

1128
01:11:02.529 --> 01:11:05.130
and she looks across
the room at her groom,


1129
01:11:05.132 --> 01:11:07.299
and she's got
these tears in her eyes,


1130
01:11:07.301 --> 01:11:11.937
like she can't see anybody else,
she's lost in the moment.


1131
01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:14.207
And that's it?

1132
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:18.044
Bradley, the question really is...

1133
01:11:18.046 --> 01:11:19.380
Do you love her?

1134
01:11:19.382 --> 01:11:21.616
Of course.

1135
01:11:21.618 --> 01:11:24.985
I mean, she's done so much
for me, for my career.


1136
01:11:24.987 --> 01:11:26.488
But do you love her?

1137
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.489
Yes.

1138
01:11:27.491 --> 01:11:30.659
You know, I... I love her.

1139
01:11:32.027 --> 01:11:34.163
You sure this is
what you want to do?


1140
01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:38.535
I am, yeah.

1141
01:11:38.537 --> 01:11:40.569
So, I guess I'll see you
at the wedding rehearsal.


1142
01:11:40.571 --> 01:11:42.873
Yeah.

1143
01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:44.242
Okay.

1144
01:11:48.213 --> 01:11:49.280
Thanks.

1145
01:11:49.282 --> 01:11:51.082
Yeah, you bet.

1146
01:12:30.029 --> 01:12:31.562
Okay, let's get started.

1147
01:12:31.564 --> 01:12:34.733
Bradley, hup-two.

1148
01:12:34.736 --> 01:12:38.137
All right, you'll stand
here next to me, faced this way,


1149
01:12:38.139 --> 01:12:40.340
and, Catherine,
when the music starts,


1150
01:12:40.342 --> 01:12:42.308
cross that bridge,
down that row,


1151
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:45.212
and then you'll walk down
the aisle towards Bradley.


1152
01:12:45.214 --> 01:12:46.981
Got it.

1153
01:12:46.983 --> 01:12:49.350
Okay,
let's try this.


1154
01:14:08.507 --> 01:14:11.044
- Hi, James.
- Hi, Sarah.


1155
01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:16.551
- I'm real sorry about this.
- Yeah. Me too.


1156
01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:18.318
Thank you.

1157
01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:25.727
Hello?

1158
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:27.929
Sarah?

1159
01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:29.864
I need to talk to you!

1160
01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:31.633
Hello there!

1161
01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:34.137
Aren't you be supposed to be
getting ready for your wedding?


1162
01:14:34.139 --> 01:14:35.972
Where's Sarah?

1163
01:14:35.974 --> 01:14:37.608
She's gone.

1164
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:39.710
I don't understand.
What do you mean?


1165
01:14:39.712 --> 01:14:41.880
Well, she no longer
owns this ranch.


1166
01:14:41.882 --> 01:14:43.483
What?

1167
01:14:43.484 --> 01:14:44.716
She would never sell her ranch.

1168
01:14:44.718 --> 01:14:46.450
She didn't have a choice.

1169
01:14:46.452 --> 01:14:48.452
She simply didn't have enough
money to make the mortgage.


1170
01:14:48.454 --> 01:14:51.356
The bank had to sell it.
They didn't have a choice.


1171
01:14:51.358 --> 01:14:56.263
I'm taking care of the dogs, but
the horses are getting picked up.


1172
01:14:56.265 --> 01:14:59.066
Well, I'll talk to the people who
bought it, and I'll get it back.


1173
01:14:59.068 --> 01:15:00.267
Who bought the ranch?

1174
01:15:01.069 --> 01:15:02.436
You did.

1175
01:15:04.874 --> 01:15:06.741
Excuse me.

1176
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:11.214
That's very good.
That's perfect.


1177
01:15:12.715 --> 01:15:14.549
Catherine?

1178
01:15:15.852 --> 01:15:17.219
You can't come in here.

1179
01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:18.454
I need to speak to you.

1180
01:15:18.456 --> 01:15:20.389
You can't see the bride before
the wedding, it's bad luck!


1181
01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:22.894
Did you buy Sarah's ranch?

1182
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:25.629
Okay.

1183
01:15:25.633 --> 01:15:27.431
Everybody out.

1184
01:15:27.433 --> 01:15:29.333
The groom needs to speak
to the bride.


1185
01:15:35.175 --> 01:15:37.710
Bradley,

1186
01:15:37.712 --> 01:15:40.780
I know how much this place
means to you,


1187
01:15:40.782 --> 01:15:42.348
and I know you want to keep it.

1188
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:44.751
What's that have to do with
you buying Sarah's ranch?


1189
01:15:44.753 --> 01:15:46.153
We can expand the property,

1190
01:15:46.155 --> 01:15:48.589
build a new house here,
a real house,


1191
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:52.294
...a house we can come back to.
A house worthy of people like us.


1192
01:15:52.296 --> 01:15:55.331
- People like us?
- You know what I mean.


1193
01:15:58.568 --> 01:16:00.402
Who the heck is that?

1194
01:16:01.405 --> 01:16:03.139
Do you mind?

1195
01:16:05.076 --> 01:16:08.278
- He's with People Magazine.
- Are you kidding me?


1196
01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.147
I know you didn't want
the media at our wedding...


1197
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:11.782
We discussed this!

1198
01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:14.353
He promised he'd be discreet.
You won't even notice him.


1199
01:16:14.355 --> 01:16:16.989
Right.

1200
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:22.127
I love all the flowers
for the wedding.


1201
01:16:22.129 --> 01:16:26.032
How did you know that yellow
roses were my favorite?


1202
01:16:26.034 --> 01:16:28.536
I didn't.

1203
01:16:28.538 --> 01:16:29.870
Sarah must have known.

1204
01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:33.542
You know, that ranch is her home.

1205
01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:36.209
She's lived there her entire life.

1206
01:16:36.211 --> 01:16:40.997
I think it's so sweet that
you still care about her.


1207
01:16:42.385 --> 01:16:44.120
It's one of the reasons
I love you so much.


1208
01:16:44.122 --> 01:16:46.188
I can't marry you.

1209
01:16:48.392 --> 01:16:49.460
Sorry?

1210
01:16:50.427 --> 01:16:53.230
I can't marry you.

1211
01:16:53.232 --> 01:16:55.966
Of course you can.

1212
01:16:55.968 --> 01:16:58.135
Do you love me?

1213
01:16:58.137 --> 01:17:01.106
- Of course I do.
- Why?


1214
01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:04.709
Because we're perfect
for each other.


1215
01:17:04.711 --> 01:17:07.681
We understand each other.
We want the same things.


1216
01:17:07.683 --> 01:17:10.916
I'm not going to tour
for a while.


1217
01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:14.388
I'm going to live here, play locally,
build a studio, and write music.


1218
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:15.790
That's so silly.

1219
01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.957
Your career is on fire,
you're gaining momentum...


1220
01:17:17.959 --> 01:17:19.159
Catherine.

1221
01:17:20.295 --> 01:17:23.932
I care about you,
I do.


1222
01:17:25.636 --> 01:17:28.369
But it's just not enough.

1223
01:17:30.541 --> 01:17:32.610
I'm sorry.

1224
01:18:29.448 --> 01:18:30.953
Hey, welcome home, Sarah.

1225
01:18:30.955 --> 01:18:35.269
Well, thanks, Sam,
but it's not home anymore.


1226
01:18:35.271 --> 01:18:36.507
I'm just here to pack up.

1227
01:18:36.509 --> 01:18:37.644
Oh, I see.

1228
01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:39.852
Where will you go?

1229
01:18:39.854 --> 01:18:42.195
I don't know.

1230
01:18:42.197 --> 01:18:43.499
Hey, I'm...

1231
01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:45.440
I'm sorry.

1232
01:18:45.442 --> 01:18:48.586
Thanks, Sam.
See you around.


1233
01:19:04.279 --> 01:19:05.548
Hi!

1234
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:06.585
Hi, guys!

1235
01:19:06.587 --> 01:19:07.688
Hi!

1236
01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:08.793
It's so good to see you!

1237
01:19:09.797 --> 01:19:11.603
I missed you so much!

1238
01:19:12.776 --> 01:19:16.889
Kelly, what are you barking at?
What's going on?


1239
01:19:16.891 --> 01:19:19.031
What's going on, you guys?

1240
01:19:27.061 --> 01:19:28.600
Where are you guys going?

1241
01:19:28.602 --> 01:19:30.441
What got into you?

1242
01:19:30.443 --> 01:19:31.911
Kelly!

1243
01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:41.915
Kelly, whatcha got there?

1244
01:19:43.423 --> 01:19:45.930
What's in there?

1245
01:19:53.896 --> 01:19:54.997
Hi.

1246
01:19:56.571 --> 01:19:59.548
What is going on?

1247
01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:01.087
Did you decide
to have the wedding today?


1248
01:20:01.089 --> 01:20:02.157
Where's Catherine?

1249
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:04.700
I'm not sure.

1250
01:20:05.203 --> 01:20:08.246
I don't understand.

1251
01:20:08.248 --> 01:20:10.187
Well...

1252
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:15.272
I was thinking
we could renew our vows.


1253
01:20:15.274 --> 01:20:17.044
We got married
when we were kids.


1254
01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:21.228
I think that was
our one chance at true love.


1255
01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.912
True love, huh?

1256
01:20:25.914 --> 01:20:27.183
Well, I don't know.

1257
01:20:27.185 --> 01:20:30.628
That's romantic, not realistic.

1258
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:31.733
I agree...

1259
01:20:32.972 --> 01:20:35.949
It's rare,

1260
01:20:35.951 --> 01:20:38.325
but I don't want to settle
for less.


1261
01:20:39.864 --> 01:20:41.335
You don't?

1262
01:20:47.995 --> 01:20:50.134
Mint chip,

1263
01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:51.406
blue...

1264
01:20:52.511 --> 01:20:54.818
Horses and dogs...

1265
01:20:55.925 --> 01:20:57.596
White lilies...

1266
01:20:59.504 --> 01:21:01.978
This ranch...

1267
01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:08.938
And these people.

1268
01:21:10.209 --> 01:21:13.420
Those are
all my favorite things.


1269
01:21:16.968 --> 01:21:20.213
I love you with all of my heart,

1270
01:21:20.215 --> 01:21:23.023
and I want to walk through
life leaning against you


1271
01:21:23.025 --> 01:21:25.399
so that neither one of us falls.

1272
01:21:26.436 --> 01:21:27.440
You...

1273
01:21:27.442 --> 01:21:30.517
Are my true love.

1274
01:21:41.659 --> 01:21:42.863
Sarah Standor...

1275
01:21:47.582 --> 01:21:50.457
Will you marry me...

1276
01:21:50.459 --> 01:21:51.896
Again?

1277
01:22:18.362 --> 01:22:23.112
And do you, Sarah, promise to love
Bradley in sickness and in health,


1278
01:22:23.114 --> 01:22:25.454
forever and ever?

1279
01:22:26.759 --> 01:22:29.334
I do.

1280
01:22:29.336 --> 01:22:31.442
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.


1281
01:22:31.444 --> 01:22:33.852
You may kiss the bride.
