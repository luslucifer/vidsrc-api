00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:07.455
How did you come to
be here in this gray place?


2
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:19.380
Were you back in into the cold
by something larger than you?


3
00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:27.475
You were flush

4
00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.519
and vibrant...

5
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:33.176
now covered in mist,

6
00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.573
a wasted match stick.

7
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.581
Were you deceived into life?

8
00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:55.242
Was your heart cut so untruly?

9
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.256
Let me hold you...

10
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.175
take you to the
places not yet known,


11
00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.624
give to you the riches you lost.

12
00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:37.719
This, I promise.

13
00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:45.161
I promise.

14
00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:00.524
Can you hear me?

15
00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.267
Aaron?

16
00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.624
I'm here.

17
00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.718
I'm here.

18
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.073
Now, breathe.

19
00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:42.827
Come on!

20
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.066
- Hey, man, what's up?
- Sam! I need you to come and get me right now.


21
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.310
- Woohoo, slow down bro.
- Sam, shut up!


22
00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:49.530
I need you right now,
okay, right now.


23
00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:50.966
I'm in a rest stop off 26.

24
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.924
- What are you talking about?
- Off...


25
00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:54.491
Jesus Christ,
are you for real, man?


26
00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:56.580
- Right now...
- Chill out, okay.


27
00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:01.759
- Sam, now.
- What happened dude?


28
00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:03.674
I'll tell you when you get here.

29
00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:04.718
Where?

30
00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:10.942
Rest stop off 26, come get me!

31
00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:14.076
- Jesus, just drive.
- Drive? No. I...


32
00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:15.164
I don't have the truck.

33
00:03:15.207 --> 00:03:17.166
I'm in a bathroom
and I'm bleeding.


34
00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.385
- I'm hurt...
- You're what?


35
00:03:18.428 --> 00:03:20.125
If you have a kit,
bring it, I don't care,


36
00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.103
just put your jacket on,
get in your car and come and get me!


37
00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:24.478
Aaron, where's Elijah?

38
00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:30.179
Look, I'm just
freaking out, man.


39
00:03:39.362 --> 00:03:41.930
Hello. Hello!

40
00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:44.367
- Shit.
- Excuse me, sir.


41
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:49.111
I'm Officer Burgess,
can you step outside, please?


42
00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:50.242
Aaron, are you there?

43
00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.506
Appreciate your cooperation.

44
00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.116
Oh, yeah...

45
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.074
- Sir?
- Yeah, in a minute.


46
00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:57.641
Dude, what's going on?

47
00:03:57.685 --> 00:03:59.861
It's a cop, there's a cop.

48
00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:02.429
Last time I'm gonna tell you.
I need you to come out...


49
00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:03.710
Tell him
you're taking a piss.


50
00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:05.519
No, wait,
I'm taking a piss.


51
00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:07.801
- Tell him you're using the bathroom.
- Shut the fuck up.


52
00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.436
Step outside right now.

53
00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:10.611
Oh!

54
00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:12.874
Just... just give me a second.

55
00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:15.398
Open up!
I'm ordering you! Open up.


56
00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:18.140
- Alright. I'm... I'm on the way. I'm coming!
- Hurry up!


57
00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:20.379
- Stop resisting.
- Where's Elijah anyway?


58
00:04:20.403 --> 00:04:22.163
- Open up right now!
- Jesus Christ!


59
00:04:22.187 --> 00:04:24.587
You can't let him in. 
Just tell him to fucking go away

60
00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:26.366
- Open up, sir!
- Aaron.


61
00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.672
Aaron. Aaron!

62
00:04:43.252 --> 00:04:44.384
Aaron.

63
00:04:49.563 --> 00:04:50.999
Aaron!

64
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.314
Come on, Aaron!

65
00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:05.405
Answer me.

66
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:07.971
Aaron!

67
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.246
Pick up!

68
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.509
Pick up the phone.

69
00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:33.694
Aaron! What the fuck,
Aaron, come on? Answer me.


70
00:05:33.737 --> 00:05:34.738
Yeah.

71
00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:36.218
Holy shit, Aaron!

72
00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:38.263
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


73
00:05:38.307 --> 00:05:39.656
Yeah, I'm...

74
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.571
- Okay, I'm... I'm coming.
- Please.


75
00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:43.573
- I'm coming, I'm on the way.
- Yeah.


76
00:05:43.617 --> 00:05:45.140
I'll be there soon. Stay there.

77
00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:46.271
Yeah, okay.

78
00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:47.490
Okay, I'm on the way.

79
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:56.281
Is this our beginning?

80
00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:58.936
So many of us,

81
00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:01.548
each unique,

82
00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:07.467
toiled, imprinted on the other,

83
00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:11.645
our whole lives ahead of us,

84
00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:13.342
free to choose,

85
00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:19.217
only parts of the greater
whole marshaled into our place,

86
00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:23.091
so close, never to touch.

87
00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:25.441
Can you feel them?

88
00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:29.271
Billions of lives apart like us?

89
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.405
Should it be across
the cradle of time


90
00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.060
from every soul there ever was,

91
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.455
mine would find yours?

92
00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:42.937
How is that anything but fate?

93
00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:02.130
Aaron?

94
00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.352
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.


95
00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:09.659
Aaron, I just got off the
phone with Sam, he said...


96
00:07:09.703 --> 00:07:11.748
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

97
00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:16.710
Oh! Are... are you hurt?

98
00:07:17.754 --> 00:07:19.060
No.

99
00:07:19.103 --> 00:07:21.279
- Goddammit, Aaron, talk to me.
- I'm here.


100
00:07:22.803 --> 00:07:27.503
You gotta talk to me,
baby, what happened?


101
00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:28.548
Sam...

102
00:07:29.505 --> 00:07:32.290
Is... is Sam coming for me?

103
00:07:32.334 --> 00:07:34.945
I mean, he called you,
he's coming for me, right?


104
00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:37.034
Yeah, yeah, he said...

105
00:07:37.078 --> 00:07:40.908
he said that he's picking you
at a rest stop somewhere.


106
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:42.973
He said you're at some rest
stop, but Aaron, he said...


107
00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:44.389
he said he heard gun shots.

108
00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:46.348
He said that you might be hurt.

109
00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:47.934
- He said that you're freaking out right now.
- No, no, no, no.


110
00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.178
I don't want you to worry
about that, okay?


111
00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.616
I don't want you
to worry about that.


112
00:07:55.792 --> 00:07:56.792
I'm...

113
00:08:05.628 --> 00:08:06.760
I need you.

114
00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:11.242
My God, Aaron.

115
00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:14.724
What happened?

116
00:08:22.906 --> 00:08:24.255
I think I killed someone.

117
00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:34.701
Uhm...

118
00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:39.705
Okay.

119
00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:44.972
Okay.

120
00:08:46.103 --> 00:08:47.539
I think he might be dead.

121
00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:48.845
Uhm...

122
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:53.458
Are you okay?

123
00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:02.642
I have to go.

124
00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:04.556
No, no, no, no, Aaron,

125
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.099
you can't hang up on me right now,
don't hang up on me, please...


126
00:09:06.123 --> 00:09:07.864
Baby, I love you.

127
00:09:07.908 --> 00:09:10.475
I love you so much,
but I have to go, okay?


128
00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:12.042
I have to.

129
00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:14.479
Aaron, don't, please, do not
hang up on me right now!


130
00:09:14.523 --> 00:09:16.656
You can't hang up on
me right now, please...


131
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.983
Hey, it's Vern.

132
00:10:23.026 --> 00:10:25.028
Sorry I didn't catch you.
Leave it at the beep.


133
00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:37.345
This is some Shakespearean shit.

134
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.305
Hello in there.

135
00:10:46.136 --> 00:10:47.790
Hello?

136
00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:49.139
How are you doing?

137
00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:51.838
I'm Lieutenant Arnold Koch.

138
00:10:51.881 --> 00:10:53.317
I'm here to talk with you.

139
00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:56.843
Can you talk to me?

140
00:10:56.886 --> 00:11:00.411
Look, I'm just here to talk
with you, is that okay?


141
00:11:00.455 --> 00:11:01.543
Yeah.

142
00:11:01.586 --> 00:11:03.066
Great, good.

143
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.635
First, I need to ask you
if everyone in there is okay,


144
00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:08.680
if you're not hurt or anything?

145
00:11:08.724 --> 00:11:10.204
Get to the point.

146
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:14.164
Is there anyone
with you in there?


147
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.210
Anyone?

148
00:11:20.692 --> 00:11:21.737
Hello?

149
00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:27.787
I have my girlfriend

150
00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:30.876
and you better...

151
00:11:32.704 --> 00:11:34.881
You better back
the fuck up, man!


152
00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:36.360
Back it up!

153
00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.860
All right, please,
listen to what I'm saying...


154
00:11:37.884 --> 00:11:39.276
No, you listen!

155
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.149
Back the fuck up,
man, you hear me?


156
00:11:42.192 --> 00:11:44.020
All right, all right.

157
00:11:44.064 --> 00:11:46.893
We're gonna work on a message to
talk to you a little better, okay?


158
00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:50.244
Fine! Just give me
some space! Back it up!


159
00:12:08.653 --> 00:12:11.352
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

160
00:12:35.332 --> 00:12:37.857
Your soul was born
in the heart of a dying star.


161
00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:42.600
You were not flesh.

162
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.779
You were something
more... elemental.


163
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.914
Heaven beneath the soft earth.

164
00:12:57.615 --> 00:12:59.748
You were light made to breathe.

165
00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:04.274
Hey in there.

166
00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.279
Hello!

167
00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.457
Yeah.

168
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.632
It's Arnold Koch.

169
00:13:14.676 --> 00:13:17.287
Yeah,
Lieutenant Koch, got it.


170
00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:20.058
Hey, what's your name?

171
00:13:21.204 --> 00:13:22.510
Are you all right in there?

172
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.079
Listen, man, I'm not
giving you my name,


173
00:13:26.122 --> 00:13:27.732
and you're not getting in here.

174
00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:29.691
Do me a favor though, back up.

175
00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:34.087
I know you
must be feeling scared,


176
00:13:35.436 --> 00:13:37.394
maybe regretful.

177
00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:39.222
- Now, I'd like to listen...
- Mitch.


178
00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:42.008
Excuse me?

179
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:45.054
Mitch. I'm gonna say
my name is Mitch.


180
00:13:45.098 --> 00:13:47.361
It's my eighth grade
algebra teacher.


181
00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:51.626
Your teacher?
Did he mean a lot to you?


182
00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:53.367
You want a name, there you go.

183
00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:57.893
Okay then,
Mitch, thank you.


184
00:13:59.068 --> 00:14:03.203
Hey, Mitch, I need to know
how many people are in there.


185
00:14:03.246 --> 00:14:06.510
Well, it's me, my girlfriend,

186
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.425
and fuck off!

187
00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:12.168
Mitch, if you don't help me,
then I can't help you. These guys...


188
00:14:12.212 --> 00:14:16.129
Oh, you're pulling every trick in the book,
man, every single trick!


189
00:14:17.173 --> 00:14:20.481
"Oh, you must be feeling
scared and regretful."


190
00:14:20.524 --> 00:14:22.352
"Oh, did your teacher
mean a lot to you?"


191
00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:24.224
"Oh, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch."

192
00:14:24.267 --> 00:14:27.183
Like you care what my name is.

193
00:14:27.227 --> 00:14:31.535
Let me make this shit as crystal
clear as I can, Lieutenant!


194
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.625
I'm not coming out and
you're not getting in.


195
00:14:34.669 --> 00:14:37.019
And I swear to God, if
you try and make a move,


196
00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:39.630
bitches die!

197
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.980
Got it?

198
00:14:43.808 --> 00:14:46.594
I don't think bloodshed is
the best way to end this, Mitch.


199
00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:49.510
Now, I'm here to help you.

200
00:14:51.077 --> 00:14:52.687
I wanna know
your side of things.


201
00:14:55.777 --> 00:14:59.781
There's nothing you can do
that you can't turn back from.


202
00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:02.435
Okay?

203
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.179
You can turn this around.

204
00:15:06.222 --> 00:15:10.357
All you need to do
is open that door.


205
00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:14.013
I don't think so, Lieutenant.

206
00:15:16.885 --> 00:15:19.714
The way I see it, this door
is all I have right now.


207
00:15:20.715 --> 00:15:23.109
I think I'll hang on
to it just a bit longer.


208
00:15:29.593 --> 00:15:31.030
Can you hear me?

209
00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:44.478
I'm here.

210
00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:56.881
Hey, it's Vern.
Sorry I didn't catch you.


211
00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.667
Oh, this is Vern,

212
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.409
I can't pick up right now
because my phone is in my ass.


213
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.266
- Hey, man.
- Hey.


214
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.789
- Are you here?
- Yeah.


215
00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:20.051
Awesome.

216
00:17:20.095 --> 00:17:23.664
Listen, Sam, I need
you to charge the cop.


217
00:17:23.707 --> 00:17:25.535
- What?
- Bum-rush him.


218
00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.320
What? No dude.

219
00:17:27.363 --> 00:17:29.104
Listen, Sam, hit him.

220
00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:30.690
I can't get out of
here unless I have...


221
00:17:30.714 --> 00:17:32.388
I can't do that, man,
are you... are you nuts?


222
00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:33.848
Just do this for me, man. Just...

223
00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:36.024
We're almost at the
finish line, okay?


224
00:17:36.067 --> 00:17:38.766
You don't understand, man,
the place is crawling.


225
00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:41.725
- What?
- Yeah, dude.


226
00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.380
I'd count like eight cop cars,
Five-O's everywhere.


227
00:17:47.296 --> 00:17:48.471
Fuck!

228
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.779
Fuck!

229
00:17:51.822 --> 00:17:53.433
Yeah, fuck is right.

230
00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:57.741
I thought it was just one dude.
Stupid, stupid!


231
00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:59.395
Yeah, well, it ain't.

232
00:17:59.439 --> 00:18:00.875
Shit!

233
00:18:00.918 --> 00:18:03.007
Well, that fucks up my plan.

234
00:18:03.051 --> 00:18:06.533
What? Your plan
was for me to hit a cop?


235
00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:09.362
Yeah, and run.

236
00:18:09.405 --> 00:18:11.842
Shit, shit, shit!

237
00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:13.540
What now, dog?

238
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:15.716
I don't know yet,
man, I'm thinking.


239
00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:18.109
Well, they look like
they mean business, bro.


240
00:18:18.153 --> 00:18:20.286
I could see one dude,
his gun pointed at the door.


241
00:18:21.678 --> 00:18:23.637
Don't fucking tell me
there's a SWAT team.


242
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.680
No.

243
00:18:25.552 --> 00:18:27.162
Good.

244
00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:30.774
What the fuck did you do,
man, to piss them off?


245
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.689
It's been a day.

246
00:18:32.733 --> 00:18:35.823
Yeah. Where's Elijah?

247
00:18:37.303 --> 00:18:38.260
He bailed.

248
00:18:38.304 --> 00:18:39.261
- Hey...
- What?


249
00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:40.741
Sam, do me a favor.

250
00:18:40.784 --> 00:18:42.525
- I need you...
- Bailed?


251
00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:47.530
Yeah. Sam, I need this favor,
all right? Can you see the door?


252
00:18:48.575 --> 00:18:49.967
Yeah, the pisser, right?

253
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:52.056
Yeah, see the holes?

254
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.016
Holy shit, was that you?
You did that?


255
00:18:55.059 --> 00:18:56.060
Kinda had to.

256
00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:57.410
Shit, man.

257
00:18:57.453 --> 00:19:00.282
Yeah. Can you like...

258
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:03.067
Can you like...

259
00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:10.249
Can you see if there's blood
on the door, can you see?


260
00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:17.125
No, man.

261
00:19:19.823 --> 00:19:22.086
No?

262
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.306
I can't see anything.

263
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:29.529
An ambulance, a fucking body bag,
anything, anything at all?


264
00:19:29.572 --> 00:19:31.922
I see a dude with a camera
snapping pictures. That's it.


265
00:19:31.966 --> 00:19:34.403
But listen, man, I gotta
bounce, I gotta back off.


266
00:19:34.447 --> 00:19:36.492
It looks sketch as hell
me sitting here like this.


267
00:19:36.536 --> 00:19:39.321
- And I'm carrying, so...
- Yeah, do what you gotta do.


268
00:19:39.365 --> 00:19:41.497
We'll figure
something out. All right?


269
00:19:41.541 --> 00:19:42.933
I ain't leaving you.

270
00:19:42.977 --> 00:19:45.284
I really appreciate
it, man, thanks.


271
00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:47.068
I know,
I'm a peach. Just...


272
00:19:48.374 --> 00:19:49.374
You okay?

273
00:20:10.265 --> 00:20:12.311
How does
the light blind us?


274
00:20:17.098 --> 00:20:18.882
Carry us in its glow?

275
00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:25.672
Reveal to us the world?

276
00:20:29.415 --> 00:20:31.547
We live so little
of its spectrum.


277
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:37.336
Drink in so little
of its warmth.


278
00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:46.345
Wrapped in it and
blind to its nature.


279
00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:38.440
Hey, it's Vern.

280
00:21:38.484 --> 00:21:41.269
Sorry I didn't catch you.
Leave it at the beep.


281
00:21:41.312 --> 00:21:42.270
Motherfucker.

282
00:21:42.313 --> 00:21:43.358
Mitch?

283
00:21:46.535 --> 00:21:47.535
Yeah.

284
00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.366
I still like to hear things
from your point of view.


285
00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:55.196
You know, I don't
really feel like talking.


286
00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:57.111
That's okay. It's okay.

287
00:21:58.329 --> 00:21:59.418
Okay then.

288
00:22:01.507 --> 00:22:03.683
You have
a phone in there, Mitch?


289
00:22:03.726 --> 00:22:05.032
So what?

290
00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.915
Maybe we can talk
together on the phone.


291
00:22:07.687 --> 00:22:09.166
You would think
that would be easier.


292
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.951
No, I need to take this.

293
00:22:10.994 --> 00:22:12.822
You need to talk with me, Mitch.

294
00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:14.781
We're talking,
we're just talking.


295
00:22:14.824 --> 00:22:18.437
But right now, I wanna
hear from your girlfriend, okay?


296
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.134
Jesus, would you shut up?

297
00:22:20.177 --> 00:22:21.918
We have to know she's okay.

298
00:22:21.962 --> 00:22:24.878
She's fine! I'm making a phone
call right now, give me a minute.


299
00:22:24.921 --> 00:22:26.595
We have to know she's okay.

300
00:22:26.619 --> 00:22:28.011
Piss off!

301
00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:29.641
- What the fuck, dude?
- Vern, goddammit!


302
00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:31.121
I've been trying
to reach you all night.


303
00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:33.103
I'm in a movie, bro.

304
00:22:33.147 --> 00:22:35.517
Well, you picked a hell of night, dumb shit.
Elijah and I did our thing.


305
00:22:35.541 --> 00:22:36.629
Just now?

306
00:22:36.672 --> 00:22:38.500
I don't know, man,
like an hour ago.


307
00:22:38.544 --> 00:22:40.763
Well,
this ain't eBay. Okay?


308
00:22:40.807 --> 00:22:43.679
I can't exactly get rid of the
jewels this fucking second.


309
00:22:43.723 --> 00:22:45.551
I thought you were
waiting a few days anyway.


310
00:22:45.594 --> 00:22:48.510
Vern, shut the fuck up.
Shit went south, man, real bad.


311
00:22:50.817 --> 00:22:52.340
Gone?

312
00:22:52.383 --> 00:22:55.996
Like motherfucker behind the
counter pulled a knife, yes.


313
00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:59.521
Okay, okay,
but you got this shit, right?


314
00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:00.609
Yeah, but...

315
00:23:02.568 --> 00:23:04.134
But what?

316
00:23:04.178 --> 00:23:06.397
I'm up the creek, man,
the cops got me.


317
00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:08.661
What the fuck, you fucking...

318
00:23:08.704 --> 00:23:11.664
Vern, Vern, chill
the fuck out, man.


319
00:23:11.707 --> 00:23:13.666
I'm not under arrest,
I'm hiding.


320
00:23:13.709 --> 00:23:15.929
So, what? The cops
know where you are?


321
00:23:15.972 --> 00:23:17.757
Where... where the fuck are you?

322
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.153
I'm in a bathroom, man,
fucking nasty ass bathroom and it's grimy.


323
00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:29.420
Fuck, man, can't believe
you fucking tried to call me.


324
00:23:29.464 --> 00:23:31.727
You realize they're
gonna trace this shit?


325
00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:32.946
I need your help.

326
00:23:32.989 --> 00:23:35.514
Listen, you're fucked.

327
00:23:35.557 --> 00:23:37.864
God can't even help you, man.

328
00:23:37.907 --> 00:23:39.867
You just bought
yourself like twenty years,


329
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:42.956
and right now,
you're dragging me in it.


330
00:23:42.999 --> 00:23:46.437
I'm not gonna be in an
accessory to your dumb ass.


331
00:23:46.481 --> 00:23:49.092
I know. I know, man.

332
00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.443
I just need to delay it.

333
00:23:52.487 --> 00:23:55.534
I just gotta keep those guys
on the other side of the door


334
00:23:55.577 --> 00:23:57.274
just a little longer.

335
00:23:58.188 --> 00:24:01.191
Tell them you'll shoot yourself
if they try to breach.

336
00:24:01.235 --> 00:24:03.585
Jesus, I'm in a lobby right now.

337
00:24:03.629 --> 00:24:05.544
Yeah? And I'm in a
trucker's hell hole.


338
00:24:07.458 --> 00:24:10.331
But I can't tell them that,
I told them I got a hostage.


339
00:24:10.374 --> 00:24:12.812
Are you
fucking out of your mind?


340
00:24:12.855 --> 00:24:14.204
What?

341
00:24:14.248 --> 00:24:16.685
Goddammit, I can't believe this.

342
00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:19.209
You are such an amateur,
you realize that?


343
00:24:19.253 --> 00:24:22.082
Vern, I need your help.

344
00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:23.910
I don't need your
crap right now.


345
00:24:24.954 --> 00:24:26.608
- Just walk me through this.
- Well...


346
00:24:28.088 --> 00:24:31.221
They're gonna wanna
talk to the hostage,


347
00:24:31.265 --> 00:24:32.701
otherwise they'll breach,

348
00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:35.617
especially since they
think you're dangerous.


349
00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:37.576
- Goddammit.
- Heat.


350
00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:38.751
What?

351
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:42.406
Heat. They have
these heat cameras.


352
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.931
They know the second
there's someone else in there.


353
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.410
All right.

354
00:24:48.412 --> 00:24:49.892
I got this covered, thank you.

355
00:24:49.936 --> 00:24:52.199
- Don't call me again!
- Talk to you later.


356
00:25:09.825 --> 00:25:11.131
Can we go back?

357
00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:18.138
Cross out the punishment of
years scratched into our hearts?


358
00:25:19.966 --> 00:25:21.620
Are we still alive here?

359
00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:27.800
An arrow cannot
change its course.


360
00:25:33.806 --> 00:25:38.027
Like our very birth,
do we have no choice in this?


361
00:25:43.903 --> 00:25:46.296
Are we the consequence
of ourselves?


362
00:26:41.787 --> 00:26:43.005
Aaron!

363
00:26:43.049 --> 00:26:46.008
Laura, baby, you gotta
listen to me. Okay?


364
00:26:46.052 --> 00:26:48.532
Aaron, what the hell
is going on right now?


365
00:26:48.576 --> 00:26:51.057
Please baby, I don't
have a lot of time, okay?


366
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.252
- I want you to focus on...
- What are you talking about?


367
00:26:53.276 --> 00:26:55.733
Will you shut up for a second! What do
you mean you don't have a lot of time?


368
00:26:55.757 --> 00:26:57.846
What the hell does that mean?

369
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.330
I know you have a lot of questions,
and I'll answer them, baby.


370
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.547
- I promise. I promise.
- No, no, no, goddammit.


371
00:27:03.591 --> 00:27:05.462
No, Aaron, I'm not gonna
be able to do anything


372
00:27:05.506 --> 00:27:07.440
until you tell me what the
hell is going on right now.


373
00:27:07.464 --> 00:27:09.423
Laura, we don't
have time for this.


374
00:27:09.466 --> 00:27:11.338
You said you killed somebody.

375
00:27:12.948 --> 00:27:14.428
You said you were hurt!

376
00:27:19.563 --> 00:27:20.563
Aaron?

377
00:27:25.395 --> 00:27:27.920
If you hung up on me
again, I swear to God...


378
00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:32.402
Elijah and I were
gonna do a job.


379
00:27:33.795 --> 00:27:35.797
You're with my
fucking brother right now?


380
00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:37.016
Give him the phone?

381
00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:39.148
- Laura...
- Give him the phone, Aaron.


382
00:27:39.192 --> 00:27:41.368
- I wanna talk to my brother.
- He's not here.


383
00:27:41.411 --> 00:27:42.691
What do you mean he's not there?

384
00:27:43.936 --> 00:27:45.807
- He ditched you?
- No, it's not like that.


385
00:27:45.851 --> 00:27:47.959
Yeah, of course he did, 'cause
that's what he does, Aaron,


386
00:27:47.983 --> 00:27:49.289
'cause he's a fuck-up.

387
00:27:49.332 --> 00:27:50.899
I love him to death, but he is.

388
00:27:50.943 --> 00:27:53.554
And he jumps ship at the sign
of any sight of trouble.


389
00:27:53.597 --> 00:27:56.141
I mean, why do you think I told you
not to get mixed up in his bullshit?


390
00:27:56.165 --> 00:27:57.819
I told you it's not like that.

391
00:27:57.863 --> 00:28:00.169
God, this is gonna break
my mom's heart.


392
00:28:00.213 --> 00:28:01.780
What the hell did he
get you into?


393
00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:04.043
- We need the money, it was...
- Oh, my God!


394
00:28:04.086 --> 00:28:06.480
You did not kill
someone for money?


395
00:28:06.523 --> 00:28:08.395
No, of course not,
it's not like that.


396
00:28:08.438 --> 00:28:10.658
What the hell
did Elijah drag you into?


397
00:28:10.701 --> 00:28:11.746
I went to him!

398
00:28:14.314 --> 00:28:16.751
It was supposed to be
a quick in and out.


399
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.496
Wait, what are you saying?
What you've robbed a guy?


400
00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:25.804
Laura, we can make sense
of this later, but right now...


401
00:28:25.847 --> 00:28:27.980
- I want to know right now.
- I need your help.


402
00:28:28.023 --> 00:28:29.823
- None of this makes any sense, Aaron!
- Please!


403
00:28:32.201 --> 00:28:33.246
Please.

404
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.337
I need you to help me.

405
00:28:38.686 --> 00:28:40.775
Okay.

406
00:28:42.908 --> 00:28:43.908
Okay.

407
00:28:46.694 --> 00:28:47.826
Okay.

408
00:28:49.262 --> 00:28:54.876
Now, baby, I need you
to sound like you're scared.


409
00:28:56.182 --> 00:28:57.792
Scared?

410
00:28:57.836 --> 00:29:00.882
Like, I need you
to sound like a hostage.


411
00:29:01.796 --> 00:29:04.712
Aaron, is this a joke? 
You want me to sound like a hostage?

412
00:29:04.755 --> 00:29:06.366
Trust me baby, please, okay?

413
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:09.804
I need you to say,
"I'm here, I'm okay."


414
00:29:11.327 --> 00:29:13.367
Aaron, I don't understand
what's going on right now.


415
00:29:14.156 --> 00:29:15.636
Just say it, just...

416
00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:19.727
Just say it just like this,
say, "I'm here, I'm okay."


417
00:29:21.163 --> 00:29:23.252
I'm here, I'm okay.

418
00:29:27.996 --> 00:29:29.824
Okay. Good.

419
00:29:31.826 --> 00:29:34.176
But I... I need it
to sound more real.


420
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:36.482
Do you know what I mean?

421
00:29:37.963 --> 00:29:41.227
I'm here for you, okay? 
I am okay, and I'm here for you.

422
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.358
No, no, no, no.

423
00:29:43.838 --> 00:29:45.753
It's not about me.

424
00:29:45.796 --> 00:29:48.712
I need you to sound
like you're scared.


425
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:54.109
I need you to sound like you're
stuck and like you're scared.


426
00:29:55.632 --> 00:29:56.632
Please.

427
00:29:59.027 --> 00:30:00.115
I need this.

428
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:03.814
I need this bad, baby.
Please do this for me.


429
00:30:04.772 --> 00:30:05.860
Please.

430
00:30:08.558 --> 00:30:11.518
I'm here, I'm okay.

431
00:30:13.128 --> 00:30:14.260
Good.

432
00:30:14.303 --> 00:30:16.088
I'm here, I'm okay.

433
00:30:16.131 --> 00:30:17.263
Louder, Laura.

434
00:30:17.306 --> 00:30:19.308
I'm here, I'm okay!

435
00:30:19.352 --> 00:30:21.963
- Again.
- I'm here, I'm okay!


436
00:30:22.007 --> 00:30:24.096
- Again.
- I'm here, I'm okay!


437
00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:26.576
- Again!
- I'm here, I'm okay!


438
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.014
- Say it!
- I'm here, I'm okay!


439
00:30:29.057 --> 00:30:30.972
I'm here, I'm okay!

440
00:30:31.016 --> 00:30:33.366
Why are you making me do this?

441
00:30:42.157 --> 00:30:43.985
911, what is your emergency?

442
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:46.379
I need to talk
with Lieutenant Koch right now.


443
00:30:46.422 --> 00:30:48.250
Lieutenant Arnold Koch.

444
00:30:48.294 --> 00:30:50.533
You need to call the station
directly sir, this line is for...

445
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:55.170
No, no! Damn it. I'm the guy.
I'm the guy in the bathroom.


446
00:30:55.214 --> 00:30:56.955
You say you're in a bathroom?

447
00:30:56.998 --> 00:30:59.044
Yeah. Whatever, the standoff,

448
00:30:59.087 --> 00:31:01.350
I need to talk
with Lieutenant Koch.


449
00:31:01.394 --> 00:31:04.875
So, transfer me, patch me through,
do whatever you gotta do, okay?


450
00:31:04.919 --> 00:31:06.312
I gotta talk with him right now!

451
00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:08.357
Tell him it's Mitch,
I've got a hostage...


452
00:31:08.401 --> 00:31:10.881
Damn it, lady!
I'm the guy in the bathroom!


453
00:31:10.925 --> 00:31:12.971
Okay? Get me Koch now!

454
00:31:14.407 --> 00:31:15.451
Hold please.

455
00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:28.464
Mitch?

456
00:31:28.508 --> 00:31:30.205
I told you to give me time.

457
00:31:31.293 --> 00:31:34.035
I told you to back off.

458
00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:35.795
We need to hear
from your girlfriend...


459
00:31:35.819 --> 00:31:39.823
I'm here, I'm okay!
I'm here, I'm okay!


460
00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:41.956
Why are you making me do this?

461
00:31:44.393 --> 00:31:45.393
You heard her.

462
00:31:46.308 --> 00:31:49.964
She's here, she's okay.

463
00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:51.661
I haven't touched her.

464
00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:54.534
Okay, Mitch, that's...
that's good. Thank you.


465
00:31:54.577 --> 00:31:56.449
Now, back off, Koch.

466
00:31:56.492 --> 00:32:00.409
I'm trying to sort shit out on my end,
and I don't like you stepping.


467
00:32:00.453 --> 00:32:02.150
Now, Mitch, you
know that we can't...


468
00:35:33.796 --> 00:35:35.145
Hey.

469
00:35:35.189 --> 00:35:36.189
Hey.

470
00:35:36.886 --> 00:35:37.974
What's up?

471
00:35:38.018 --> 00:35:40.107
Bad fucking news, man.

472
00:35:41.413 --> 00:35:44.329
What is it? SWAT?

473
00:35:44.372 --> 00:35:48.768
Yeah. These guys, like
normal cops, just roll up.


474
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:50.491
They're pulling gear
out of the truck, man.


475
00:35:51.597 --> 00:35:54.730
Now, on TV they always
got these big ass tanks,


476
00:35:54.774 --> 00:35:56.384
who are wearing like bad asses,

477
00:35:56.428 --> 00:35:59.300
but no, no, these guys, they
just look like high school cops.

478
00:35:59.344 --> 00:36:01.171
What else is going on out there?

479
00:36:01.215 --> 00:36:03.913
Uh... Helicopter has
been buzzing around.


480
00:36:03.957 --> 00:36:04.957
Uh-huh.

481
00:36:07.134 --> 00:36:11.486
There is a dog, no news crews or
anything, I mean, not from where I am.


482
00:36:13.662 --> 00:36:15.403
Oh, where are you?

483
00:36:16.665 --> 00:36:19.364
Like five hundred feet
away in a parking lot.


484
00:36:22.105 --> 00:36:26.893
Sam, do you see a guy in charge

485
00:36:26.936 --> 00:36:30.288
or a guy who looks
like he's in charge?


486
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:32.851
I've seen two guys who look
like they're calling the shots.


487
00:36:37.643 --> 00:36:39.490
Do you think the SWAT team
is gonna come get me?


488
00:36:39.514 --> 00:36:40.514
No doubt.

489
00:36:41.342 --> 00:36:42.517
I called to check on you.

490
00:36:42.561 --> 00:36:43.692
I'm okay.

491
00:36:43.736 --> 00:36:45.085
Bullshit.

492
00:36:45.128 --> 00:36:46.888
Right now, you need to
tell me the game plan.


493
00:36:49.089 --> 00:36:51.570
Look, man, I don't
have a plan, all right?


494
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.790
I gotta come up with something.

495
00:36:54.834 --> 00:36:56.444
Aaron, come on!

496
00:36:56.488 --> 00:36:58.664
Dude, just come on,
just put the gun down,


497
00:36:58.707 --> 00:37:01.536
kick the shit to the side,
just walk out of here alive.


498
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.321
Hold your hands
up and walk out.


499
00:37:03.364 --> 00:37:05.061
I want to, Sam, okay?

500
00:37:05.105 --> 00:37:07.368
Believe me, I do,
but it's not that simple...


501
00:37:07.412 --> 00:37:10.129
Cut the shit, Aaron. Listen goddammit,
you got a shit hand dealt to you right now,


502
00:37:10.153 --> 00:37:12.591
but it's fucking better
than getting killed.


503
00:37:12.634 --> 00:37:16.377
It's bad luck, I know,
but you can get out of this.


504
00:37:16.421 --> 00:37:18.640
I mean, what about me, asshole?

505
00:37:18.684 --> 00:37:21.077
What about Laura, you're
gonna walk away from that?


506
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:23.166
I mean, this is stupid.

507
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.081
No.

508
00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:26.929
Look the longer this goes on,
the more likely the cops kill you.


509
00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:29.390
No, you don't get it.

510
00:37:29.434 --> 00:37:30.434
What don't I get?

511
00:37:32.698 --> 00:37:33.829
What don't I get?

512
00:37:33.873 --> 00:37:36.049
I know
what the score is.


513
00:37:36.092 --> 00:37:38.356
I know this basically
means I'm a goner.


514
00:37:38.399 --> 00:37:40.706
- No, no, no, no.
- It's for her.


515
00:37:42.272 --> 00:37:45.928
These rocks, I gotta
get them to her.


516
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:48.366
- You gotta think about you!
- I'm going in!


517
00:37:49.802 --> 00:37:50.803
Forever!

518
00:37:52.457 --> 00:37:55.851
I can't be thinking about me,
she's gotta be taken care of!


519
00:37:57.853 --> 00:38:01.074
That's why me and Elijah did it
in the first place, for Laura.


520
00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:06.427
So, I can't give up to the cops.

521
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.388
That's why I can't
surrender! Not now!


522
00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:17.873
I need more time.

523
00:38:19.701 --> 00:38:21.616
For what exactly?

524
00:38:24.097 --> 00:38:25.228
To hide the shit.

525
00:38:27.187 --> 00:38:28.187
I need...

526
00:38:30.669 --> 00:38:32.410
I need to get it to you.

527
00:38:32.453 --> 00:38:34.020
Oh, hell no.

528
00:38:34.063 --> 00:38:39.417
Listen, man, if I can stash it
or get it to you or to Vern,


529
00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:41.897
you can get it to Laura.

530
00:38:43.203 --> 00:38:46.206
I can't provide for her
if I'm locked away.


531
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.340
You... Oh, do you wanna hold up the
cops while you bury your treasure?


532
00:38:50.384 --> 00:38:51.907
Yeah.

533
00:38:51.951 --> 00:38:53.866
Christ on a cracker.

534
00:38:53.909 --> 00:38:55.389
Oh, you got a better idea?

535
00:38:57.478 --> 00:38:59.306
Yeah, give up.

536
00:39:00.525 --> 00:39:03.266
It doesn't seem like you're
gonna hear me out on that.


537
00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.310
No.

538
00:39:05.921 --> 00:39:06.921
Listen, just...

539
00:39:08.097 --> 00:39:10.017
just give me some time
to come up with something.


540
00:39:10.752 --> 00:39:11.752
Right.

541
00:39:13.189 --> 00:39:14.189
Thanks, pal.

542
00:40:06.939 --> 00:40:08.941
Hey, it's Vern, sorry...

543
00:40:12.292 --> 00:40:13.728
What?

544
00:40:13.772 --> 00:40:16.078
- Sam and I are working on a...
- You called Sam?


545
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:18.646
...working on a plan
to get the rocks to you.


546
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.865
I'm hanging up.

547
00:40:19.908 --> 00:40:21.301
If you hang up,

548
00:40:21.344 --> 00:40:24.696
I swear to God I will have
Sam show up at your place


549
00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:26.698
and beat you to death, Vern.

550
00:40:26.741 --> 00:40:28.700
Oh, that's very scary.

551
00:40:28.743 --> 00:40:32.791
Listen, you fucking ruined
my movie, you're a dick.


552
00:40:32.834 --> 00:40:35.358
I'm getting Sam the rocks.
How quick can you turn it around?


553
00:40:35.402 --> 00:40:37.143
The cops will be hard to try it.

554
00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:38.579
This shit takes time.

555
00:40:38.623 --> 00:40:40.712
Next time, don't
fuck up the job.


556
00:40:41.843 --> 00:40:43.366
Why did you call Sam?

557
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.413
Why not Elijah, this shit
is for his sister, isn't it?


558
00:40:46.456 --> 00:40:51.549
How quickly can you get
it turned around, Vern?


559
00:40:51.592 --> 00:40:54.203
Maybe forty-eight hours.

560
00:40:55.814 --> 00:40:57.511
And you can get
the money to Laura?


561
00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:59.948
Yeah, but I'm taking
a bigger cut.


562
00:41:00.819 --> 00:41:01.820
Fine.

563
00:41:08.653 --> 00:41:10.176
Start setting it up.

564
00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:12.439
Sam will get you the goods,
do not fuck this up for me.


565
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:33.112
Fuck!

566
00:41:36.419 --> 00:41:38.639
Was it you
to set this in motion?


567
00:41:45.777 --> 00:41:48.431
Was it your hand
guiding us in this life?


568
00:41:52.174 --> 00:41:53.393
What are you doing?

569
00:42:02.141 --> 00:42:05.361
Was it your stone
cast to cause these ripples?


570
00:42:10.976 --> 00:42:12.673
Did you choose this?

571
00:42:12.717 --> 00:42:15.371
I'll kill you!

572
00:42:22.074 --> 00:42:23.379
Can you hear me?

573
00:42:27.993 --> 00:42:29.777
Fucking cop!

574
00:42:33.433 --> 00:42:34.913
Oh God!

575
00:42:56.499 --> 00:42:58.327
- Yeah.
- Hello, Aaron.


576
00:42:59.546 --> 00:43:04.812
It's taken you
longer than I expected.


577
00:43:06.858 --> 00:43:11.036
Aaron, I think you should know
the Sheriff's Department is here.


578
00:43:11.079 --> 00:43:12.100
They wanna speak with you.

579
00:43:14.343 --> 00:43:15.693
Fuck you.

580
00:43:17.042 --> 00:43:19.609
You're talking with me.

581
00:43:19.653 --> 00:43:21.611
I'd love to talk to you.

582
00:43:21.655 --> 00:43:23.764
I'd love to listen to you, Aaron,
but you haven't been talking to me.


583
00:43:23.788 --> 00:43:26.399
Oh, fuck.

584
00:43:26.442 --> 00:43:30.011
Aaron, you know my name.

585
00:43:31.186 --> 00:43:32.971
You traced my number.

586
00:43:33.014 --> 00:43:37.366
Calling was the smart idea,
it was a good thing to do.


587
00:43:39.586 --> 00:43:44.460
Aaron, can you tell me
if your girlfriend is okay?


588
00:43:45.679 --> 00:43:47.289
Fuck you, Koch.

589
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:53.426
You're trying to get someone
killed in here, aren't you?


590
00:43:53.469 --> 00:43:56.081
Aaron, there was
an incident up the road.


591
00:43:56.124 --> 00:43:57.517
You know anything about that?

592
00:43:58.953 --> 00:44:00.650
Yeah.

593
00:44:00.694 --> 00:44:01.782
Will you tell me about it?

594
00:44:02.957 --> 00:44:05.917
My lungs are on fire.

595
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:12.662
If you wanna talk with me,
don't gas me, dick.


596
00:44:14.142 --> 00:44:18.016
She's fine, we'll be okay.

597
00:44:21.323 --> 00:44:23.282
Don't try that shit again.

598
00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:25.893
Get it?

599
00:44:37.165 --> 00:44:38.819
Can you hear me?

600
00:44:45.043 --> 00:44:46.043
Aaron?

601
00:44:52.093 --> 00:44:53.268
I'm here.

602
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.406
Now breathe.

603
00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:40.495
I will give you half
the take for one drop.


604
00:49:33.766 --> 00:49:36.899
I am the world's
best friend, you know that?


605
00:49:36.943 --> 00:49:38.031
What did you do?

606
00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:40.773
The woods, man,
near the bathroom,


607
00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.863
on the other side from the cops?

608
00:49:43.906 --> 00:49:48.563
Like... the woods, the trees?

609
00:49:48.607 --> 00:49:51.610
Yeah, the woods.

610
00:49:51.653 --> 00:49:53.307
Yeah, the woods, you know?

611
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:54.656
Cops are in the parking lot,

612
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.137
and then the road,
there's like the road.


613
00:49:57.181 --> 00:49:59.966
But on the other side
there's like a ditch, man.


614
00:50:00.009 --> 00:50:01.968
Sam, Sam!

615
00:50:02.011 --> 00:50:04.101
Yeah, it's like
ten feet or so, man.


616
00:50:04.144 --> 00:50:07.147
There's a big ditch
and then a bunch of trees.


617
00:50:07.191 --> 00:50:09.802
Damn it, man!

618
00:50:09.845 --> 00:50:11.630
I can't fit through that window.

619
00:50:11.673 --> 00:50:14.546
It's too small, that'll be too slow,
they'll grab me in a second.


620
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:18.506
You? Hmm, not...
not you, screw you.


621
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.247
You're going to jail.

622
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.597
Well, thanks,
world's best friend.


623
00:50:22.641 --> 00:50:24.295
Well, dude the jewels.

624
00:50:24.338 --> 00:50:26.708
The jewels, man, toss them out the window, 
I can pick them up,

625
00:50:26.732 --> 00:50:29.082
and, you know, I'll
slip in real quiet like.


626
00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:30.649
No, Sam...

627
00:50:30.692 --> 00:50:32.390
For fuck's sake, Aaron!

628
00:50:32.433 --> 00:50:34.087
But they'll
spot you, dude.


629
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:38.265
Then make a big ass
distraction for me, would you?


630
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:40.093
Toss that shit
through the window,


631
00:50:40.137 --> 00:50:41.355
I'll be waiting in the trees,

632
00:50:41.399 --> 00:50:43.357
when the coast
is clear, I'll snag it.


633
00:50:44.576 --> 00:50:46.273
And it goes to Laura, okay?

634
00:50:46.317 --> 00:50:48.971
Well, Elijah gets
his cut, so does Vern,


635
00:50:49.015 --> 00:50:51.887
and so do I, fucker,
'cause I'm dodging cops too.


636
00:50:51.931 --> 00:50:53.541
Okay, and the rest goes to her.

637
00:50:55.543 --> 00:50:57.913
By the way, Vern's been a dick,
so don't let him get handsy with his cut.


638
00:50:57.937 --> 00:50:59.634
I got you, dog.

639
00:50:59.678 --> 00:51:00.679
Do what you gotta do.

640
00:51:12.821 --> 00:51:14.258
Hey.

641
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:16.216
I called Elijah,
but he isn't answering,


642
00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.088
so... I called Sam.

643
00:51:23.397 --> 00:51:25.051
Aaron, are you there?

644
00:51:27.271 --> 00:51:30.578
Yeah, I... of course.

645
00:51:32.537 --> 00:51:33.842
You talked to Sam?

646
00:51:36.236 --> 00:51:37.236
Yeah.

647
00:51:39.587 --> 00:51:40.762
He didn't mention that.

648
00:51:42.373 --> 00:51:44.810
He said that you're surrounded
by the police right now.


649
00:51:44.853 --> 00:51:47.029
No, no, baby, baby, I'm almost...

650
00:51:47.073 --> 00:51:48.205
I can't do this.

651
00:51:49.684 --> 00:51:51.904
No, no, no, it's fine.
Sam and I are...


652
00:51:51.947 --> 00:51:55.037
I can't do this, Aaron!
I can't do this!


653
00:51:55.081 --> 00:51:58.389
I can't sit around waiting
for you for my entire life.


654
00:51:58.432 --> 00:51:59.346
No.

655
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.584
I don't want your blood money.

656
00:52:00.608 --> 00:52:02.523
Did that ever occur to you?

657
00:52:02.567 --> 00:52:04.545
Did it cross your mind that I don't
wanna sit around and pay bills


658
00:52:04.569 --> 00:52:07.833
with blood money while you rot away
in prison for the rest of your life?


659
00:52:11.053 --> 00:52:12.490
You're kidding
me right now?


660
00:52:12.533 --> 00:52:14.119
Do I sound like
I'm fucking kidding?


661
00:52:14.143 --> 00:52:16.058
I've gone through hell for you.

662
00:52:16.102 --> 00:52:19.366
Sam is outside right now putting
his life on the line for you.


663
00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.020
I don't give a hot
fuck about Sam!


664
00:52:21.063 --> 00:52:23.849
I don't care about Elijah,
I don't care about Sam,


665
00:52:23.892 --> 00:52:25.154
I care about you, Aaron!

666
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:29.550
And I can't live with this money
knowing what you did to get it.


667
00:52:37.036 --> 00:52:40.561
Laura... I'm sick of it.

668
00:52:43.172 --> 00:52:47.655
My back is breaking,
my knees have gone to hell.


669
00:52:50.179 --> 00:52:54.793
I am sick of digging holes for
fence posts and stacking boxes,


670
00:52:55.881 --> 00:53:00.189
scraping by at eight bucks
an hour at a grindy-ass job.


671
00:53:03.671 --> 00:53:05.064
Laura, I want a life.

672
00:53:08.676 --> 00:53:09.982
I want a house with you.

673
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:14.943
I wanna drive a car
not ride a bike.


674
00:53:17.685 --> 00:53:19.252
Laura, I wanna sleep in.

675
00:53:22.342 --> 00:53:25.040
I wanna wake up every
morning and see you there.


676
00:53:27.956 --> 00:53:30.568
I wanna give you the life
you should've had.


677
00:53:34.398 --> 00:53:36.574
I gave you everything I am,

678
00:53:36.617 --> 00:53:39.620
and it cost me everything I
could've been, but that's okay.


679
00:53:43.407 --> 00:53:44.843
Because you will go on

680
00:53:46.235 --> 00:53:48.847
and at least I will know,

681
00:53:51.415 --> 00:53:53.939
at least in quiet minutes,

682
00:53:56.028 --> 00:53:57.725
that you're gonna be okay.

683
00:54:05.603 --> 00:54:06.647
Okay.

684
00:54:15.308 --> 00:54:16.353
I gotta go.

685
00:54:19.486 --> 00:54:20.486
Okay.

686
00:54:21.923 --> 00:54:22.923
I love you.

687
00:54:24.404 --> 00:54:25.884
Promise you'll call back.

688
00:54:28.277 --> 00:54:29.235
I love you.

689
00:54:36.329 --> 00:54:37.329
Aaron.

690
00:54:39.419 --> 00:54:40.419
Yeah.

691
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.160
You feeling okay?

692
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:45.643
Not even close, Mr. Koch.

693
00:54:46.557 --> 00:54:47.819
Is your girlfriend there?

694
00:54:48.776 --> 00:54:50.517
Why don't you tell us her name?

695
00:54:50.561 --> 00:54:52.606
Jesus, man, you're relentless.

696
00:54:55.479 --> 00:54:56.479
Laura.

697
00:54:57.524 --> 00:54:59.483
Her name is Laura.

698
00:54:59.526 --> 00:55:03.356
The Sheriff's guys want me to ask
you about that incident up the road.


699
00:55:04.705 --> 00:55:07.142
I'm sure you have it
very well figured out.


700
00:55:07.186 --> 00:55:11.495
Look, I'm sure you must feel like we're trying
to set a trap for you, but the truth is...

701
00:55:11.538 --> 00:55:12.974
You gassed me, bro.

702
00:55:13.975 --> 00:55:15.673
We're not friends right now.

703
00:55:16.587 --> 00:55:19.459
Aaron, if we cannot
confirm that Laura is okay,


704
00:55:19.503 --> 00:55:21.461
these deputies are
coming through the door.


705
00:55:21.505 --> 00:55:24.246
We need reassurances.

706
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:27.293
Shit.

707
00:55:30.992 --> 00:55:33.430
Let me tell you how
this is gonna work.


708
00:55:33.473 --> 00:55:35.519
You're gonna back the fuck off

709
00:55:35.562 --> 00:55:37.434
or I'm coming out shooting.

710
00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:42.610
Aaron, you sound to me like a real smart
guy who ran into some real bad luck.


711
00:55:44.353 --> 00:55:46.399
Like you give a damn.

712
00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:51.535
I do. Look, it's my job to make sure
we all walk away from this alive.


713
00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:55.147
Now, please give me something
to ease these guys up.


714
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:57.497
Piss off.

715
00:55:57.541 --> 00:55:59.020
Do you care about her?

716
00:56:00.239 --> 00:56:01.327
Uhm? Aaron?

717
00:56:02.894 --> 00:56:04.504
Don't you wanna see her safe?

718
00:56:06.811 --> 00:56:07.768
Yes.

719
00:56:07.812 --> 00:56:09.291
Then let her go.

720
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:11.990
- I can't do that.
- Why not, Aaron?


721
00:56:12.033 --> 00:56:15.646
I don't know. I don't know.

722
00:56:15.689 --> 00:56:18.083
Aaron, if you don't
give me something,


723
00:56:18.126 --> 00:56:20.389
if you don't give
me something now,


724
00:56:20.433 --> 00:56:22.827
they'll breach,
they'll come in there.


725
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:24.481
I'm doing my best to help you.

726
00:56:26.657 --> 00:56:28.310
How is he?

727
00:56:28.354 --> 00:56:29.877
Excuse me?

728
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:33.141
The cop, how is he?

729
00:56:33.185 --> 00:56:34.185
Who?

730
00:56:35.013 --> 00:56:36.318
The guy I shot.

731
00:56:38.146 --> 00:56:39.539
It's...

732
00:56:41.889 --> 00:56:42.977
Did I kill him?

733
00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:46.503
What was his name?

734
00:56:50.768 --> 00:56:52.509
He's absolutely fine.

735
00:56:53.988 --> 00:56:55.337
What?

736
00:56:55.381 --> 00:56:56.948
Yeah, he's okay, Aaron.

737
00:56:58.732 --> 00:57:02.214
You didn't hit him,
you missed, he's okay.


738
00:57:07.741 --> 00:57:09.700
You didn't kill anyone.

739
00:57:11.353 --> 00:57:12.877
It's okay to come out, Aaron.

740
00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:40.644
Oh, God, please, please.

741
00:58:08.672 --> 00:58:11.022
This world
wasn't made for you.


742
00:58:23.687 --> 00:58:25.514
It has dirt in its seams.

743
00:58:29.562 --> 00:58:32.783
Come on.

744
00:58:32.826 --> 00:58:34.175
Come on.

745
00:58:38.049 --> 00:58:41.139
It's too weathered to
live under a light like yours.


746
00:59:02.116 --> 00:59:08.079
Your soul...
clung to a dirty window.


747
01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:29.829
Hello.

748
01:01:29.873 --> 01:01:30.873
Aaron!

749
01:01:31.918 --> 01:01:34.094
Jesus, I thought
something happened.


750
01:01:35.226 --> 01:01:36.618
I'm sorry.

751
01:01:36.662 --> 01:01:38.620
I've been calling, man.

752
01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:40.797
Oh... Yeah.

753
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:43.190
I'm in position.

754
01:01:43.234 --> 01:01:44.278
Huh?

755
01:01:44.322 --> 01:01:46.411
Outside.

756
01:01:46.454 --> 01:01:49.172
Just outside in the trees, the cops can't
see back here, they aren't looking.


757
01:01:52.896 --> 01:01:53.896
Dude, come on.

758
01:01:59.337 --> 01:02:00.817
I can't really see.

759
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.819
I'm right here,
I'm right here, see me?


760
01:02:03.863 --> 01:02:05.909
No, I can't see.

761
01:02:05.952 --> 01:02:08.476
I don't see you.
I don't have a good vantage.


762
01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.131
Oh, scrooge. Toss me the money.

763
01:02:11.175 --> 01:02:12.176
Which way?

764
01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:13.612
What?

765
01:02:13.655 --> 01:02:15.048
Which way do I throw it?

766
01:02:15.092 --> 01:02:18.660
I'm just in front of you,
just in front of you.


767
01:02:19.705 --> 01:02:20.837
Give me a minute.

768
01:02:25.667 --> 01:02:27.844
There're cops everywhere,
man, this is stupid!


769
01:02:27.887 --> 01:02:29.758
It'll work, just do it, come on.

770
01:02:29.802 --> 01:02:31.935
- Fuck!
- You just gotta be quick.


771
01:02:38.071 --> 01:02:39.420
Aaron.

772
01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:40.824
Okay,
let me try something.


773
01:02:45.731 --> 01:02:48.647
You need to hurry, man, 
I don't think I could be here that long.

774
01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:59.876
Dude, what are you doing? 
Stop messing around, hustle up.

775
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.577
- I think I see you.
- Okay, finally.


776
01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:08.797
Throw me the bag.

777
01:03:20.331 --> 01:03:21.245
Aaron.

778
01:03:23.987 --> 01:03:25.379
Oh, come on.

779
01:03:30.863 --> 01:03:32.256
What happened?

780
01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.176
Aaron?

781
01:04:59.778 --> 01:05:00.778
Can you hear me?

782
01:05:09.788 --> 01:05:10.788
Aaron?

783
01:05:13.574 --> 01:05:14.662
I'm here.

784
01:05:17.143 --> 01:05:21.147
What?

785
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:22.191
Hello?

786
01:05:27.762 --> 01:05:28.762
Aaron?

787
01:05:31.592 --> 01:05:33.638
I fell down.

788
01:05:33.681 --> 01:05:35.161
Can you call for help?

789
01:05:36.162 --> 01:05:38.338
- Can I?
- No.


790
01:05:39.861 --> 01:05:42.038
Where are you hurt, Aaron?

791
01:05:43.778 --> 01:05:45.650
Can you tell me where you're hurt?

792
01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.835
I feel lit at my teeth.

793
01:05:56.878 --> 01:05:58.228
Oh, my God, baby.

794
01:06:00.752 --> 01:06:03.450
I can't... I can't...

795
01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:06.540
Stop, hey, hey, just take...
take a deep breath, okay?


796
01:06:06.584 --> 01:06:07.933
Just take a deep breath, Aaron.

797
01:06:09.152 --> 01:06:10.152
Come on.

798
01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.547
Okay, good.

799
01:06:13.591 --> 01:06:15.114
Good, good.

800
01:06:15.158 --> 01:06:17.899
Now, now just listen to
the sound of my voice, okay?


801
01:06:17.943 --> 01:06:19.118
Just listen to me.

802
01:06:20.206 --> 01:06:22.208
All right? You're fine.

803
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.172
Now, breathe.

804
01:06:38.877 --> 01:06:41.401
It's okay, it's okay.

805
01:06:44.187 --> 01:06:45.797
I'm so sorry.

806
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.668
No, you're okay.

807
01:07:01.987 --> 01:07:03.858
I told you I'd be right here.

808
01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.168
I don't know what to do.

809
01:07:15.305 --> 01:07:16.654
You're too good.

810
01:07:18.438 --> 01:07:20.832
I never earned it.

811
01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:28.274
I don't deserve you.

812
01:07:34.367 --> 01:07:35.760
Tell me why.

813
01:07:37.979 --> 01:07:39.198
For us.

814
01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.027
No.

815
01:07:46.466 --> 01:07:47.989
There wasn't a choice.

816
01:07:49.817 --> 01:07:51.079
Is this your fate?

817
01:07:52.516 --> 01:07:54.257
That you have no choice?

818
01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.478
I love you.

819
01:08:04.267 --> 01:08:05.790
Tell me why.

820
01:08:16.714 --> 01:08:18.106
- My sister, Laura.
- Hey.


821
01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:26.332
Stop it, go away.

822
01:09:13.553 --> 01:09:15.381
Did you do it?

823
01:09:16.556 --> 01:09:17.818
You did it!

824
01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:22.143
For us.

825
01:10:27.714 --> 01:10:29.237
I love you.

826
01:10:32.023 --> 01:10:33.023
I love you.

827
01:11:05.491 --> 01:11:06.536
I gotta go.

828
01:11:41.658 --> 01:11:45.488
Oh, no, damn it.

829
01:11:50.928 --> 01:11:54.018
Damn it. Come on,
don't do this to me.


830
01:12:52.424 --> 01:12:54.948
Why should the universe
arrange itself for you?


831
01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:07.744
You... one of many,

832
01:13:10.747 --> 01:13:12.488
no more or less than the other.

833
01:13:14.446 --> 01:13:18.232
What is a single tear
in a life of sorrow?


834
01:13:19.582 --> 01:13:20.539
A joy?

835
01:13:24.021 --> 01:13:26.414
Is it destiny
that rearranges us,


836
01:13:28.765 --> 01:13:30.506
that forces us together?

837
01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:35.336
Through this chaos
are we shaped,


838
01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:38.688
is it chance?

839
01:13:40.559 --> 01:13:41.604
Choice?

840
01:13:46.043 --> 01:13:47.087
Faith?

841
01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:54.965
Hello.

842
01:13:55.008 --> 01:13:57.445
What did you say
happened to Elijah?


843
01:13:58.316 --> 01:13:59.316
Vern.

844
01:14:00.187 --> 01:14:02.102
I just tried calling him.

845
01:14:04.409 --> 01:14:05.758
What?

846
01:14:05.802 --> 01:14:09.806
Elijah, I tried calling him.

847
01:14:10.807 --> 01:14:13.157
- Vern...
- Fuck you, Aaron.


848
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.639
You know who picked up?
The cops.


849
01:14:16.682 --> 01:14:18.292
No, it's... it's not like that.

850
01:14:18.336 --> 01:14:22.122
You left him, didn't you?
You left him behind.


851
01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.036
No.

852
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.211
Yes, you did.

853
01:14:24.255 --> 01:14:26.083
No wonder they
were on your trail,


854
01:14:26.126 --> 01:14:28.476
you grabbed the goods
and you bailed on Elijah,


855
01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.219
and that's what you meant when you said,
"We got separated," you piece of shit.


856
01:14:32.263 --> 01:14:34.482
- Vern.
- You ditched him, didn't you?


857
01:14:34.526 --> 01:14:37.790
You don't understand. I tried
telling you, things went south.


858
01:14:37.834 --> 01:14:40.184
You're a fucking coward.

859
01:14:40.227 --> 01:14:42.186
Vern, I can explain it to you.

860
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:45.232
Fuck you! I'm not helping you.

861
01:14:45.276 --> 01:14:46.843
It's not for me, it's...

862
01:14:46.886 --> 01:14:49.236
I can't believe you'd fucking
do that to Elijah, man.


863
01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.459
I hope they nail you to
a cross, you spineless piece of shit.

864
01:14:54.502 --> 01:14:55.591
Please.

865
01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:58.375
Fuck!

866
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:01.422
We got
someone over here.


867
01:15:01.466 --> 01:15:03.294
Freeze, Sheriff's Department.

868
01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:05.141
- Aaron!
- Sheriff's Department!


869
01:15:05.165 --> 01:15:07.230
Sheriff's Department,
get down on the ground.


870
01:15:07.254 --> 01:15:08.734
Sheriff's Department!

871
01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:11.476
Stop resisting.

872
01:15:11.519 --> 01:15:12.390
Sam.

873
01:15:12.433 --> 01:15:14.261
Yo, Aaron, Aaron!

874
01:15:14.305 --> 01:15:15.978
- Sam!
- Get down, get down on the floor right now.


875
01:15:16.002 --> 01:15:17.047
Knock down the door.

876
01:15:20.528 --> 01:15:22.052
Hurry!

877
01:15:22.095 --> 01:15:24.663
- Let me see your hands.
- Let me go, dude.


878
01:15:38.677 --> 01:15:39.677
Sam!

879
01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:06.357
Hello.

880
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.141
Aaron.

881
01:16:08.185 --> 01:16:09.185
Sam!

882
01:16:09.969 --> 01:16:11.405
I'm sorry, bro.

883
01:16:11.449 --> 01:16:12.929
No, no, no.

884
01:16:13.799 --> 01:16:16.976
- No, it's... it's me, I should...
- Aaron...


885
01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:22.547
It's time to come outside, man.

886
01:16:27.334 --> 01:16:28.422
It's over.

887
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:33.819
Put him on.

888
01:16:33.863 --> 01:16:35.299
Oh, please, buddy,
I'm asking you.


889
01:16:35.342 --> 01:16:38.389
Sam, put him on.

890
01:16:47.137 --> 01:16:48.399
Hello, Aaron.

891
01:16:52.577 --> 01:16:54.013
Let him go.

892
01:16:55.058 --> 01:16:57.451
Your friend wants the same
thing we want, Aaron.


893
01:16:57.495 --> 01:16:59.018
I think it's time
to come out now.


894
01:17:01.934 --> 01:17:03.719
You haven't made
any demands all night.


895
01:17:03.762 --> 01:17:05.329
You've kept your head
on your shoulders.


896
01:17:05.372 --> 01:17:08.201
I shot at one of your guys.

897
01:17:08.245 --> 01:17:09.439
But you've been talking with me.

898
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:19.169
No, I can't do that.

899
01:17:23.216 --> 01:17:26.002
Aaron, we know it's
just you in there.


900
01:17:31.529 --> 01:17:32.529
What?

901
01:17:35.402 --> 01:17:37.622
We know you've been
calling Laura all night.


902
01:17:39.537 --> 01:17:41.017
We know she's not in there.

903
01:17:51.549 --> 01:17:53.856
You were looking
after your guys,


904
01:17:53.899 --> 01:17:55.727
that's why you haven't
tried to breach again.


905
01:17:57.642 --> 01:17:59.296
We're looking after you, Aaron.

906
01:18:02.734 --> 01:18:04.083
Go easy on Sam.

907
01:18:11.264 --> 01:18:12.875
Fuck off.

908
01:18:12.918 --> 01:18:14.354
Please, Vern, don't hang up.

909
01:18:19.359 --> 01:18:20.970
It's not for me, it's for Laura.

910
01:18:21.013 --> 01:18:22.449
It's absolutely for you.

911
01:18:22.493 --> 01:18:25.017
Vern, the cops can come in
here any minute and kill me.


912
01:18:25.061 --> 01:18:27.324
- Good!
- Goddammit, Vern!


913
01:18:27.367 --> 01:18:30.980
In ten minutes, I'm gone for good, all right?
This isn't a fucking joke!


914
01:18:31.023 --> 01:18:33.983
Oh, it's the biggest fucking
joke I've ever heard.


915
01:18:34.026 --> 01:18:35.898
You are, you are the joke.

916
01:18:42.643 --> 01:18:44.689
If you don't help me out,
it was all for nothing.


917
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:50.477
Vern, it was for nothing,
but you can make it worthwhile, okay?


918
01:18:50.521 --> 01:18:53.263
You can, right now,
you can make all of this worth something.


919
01:18:53.306 --> 01:18:55.569
- It'll be a cold day in hell.
- Goodman it.


920
01:18:55.613 --> 01:18:57.006
What happened to Elijah?

921
01:18:58.355 --> 01:18:59.660
What happened to him?

922
01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:09.757
You have to come here.

923
01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:12.673
After they take me away,
you have to come back here and get the money.


924
01:19:12.717 --> 01:19:14.129
All right, I'll rope
it off or something...


925
01:19:14.153 --> 01:19:15.459
Aaron!

926
01:19:15.502 --> 01:19:20.638
Vern, me, Elijah, Sam,
we got it this far, okay?


927
01:19:20.681 --> 01:19:22.901
Right? And we're
counting on you.


928
01:19:22.945 --> 01:19:26.600
Laura, Laura is counting
on you, all right?


929
01:19:26.644 --> 01:19:30.604
This is why you're here, man,
it was... it was you all along.


930
01:19:30.648 --> 01:19:34.391
Right? It was you, you were
the last piece of the puzzle.


931
01:19:34.434 --> 01:19:35.434
All right?

932
01:19:36.567 --> 01:19:37.611
And I'm begging you.

933
01:19:39.091 --> 01:19:41.789
I'm begging you
right now, please.


934
01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:44.488
Vern, please, help me.

935
01:19:44.531 --> 01:19:45.706
Please, help Laura.

936
01:19:55.107 --> 01:19:58.589
No, no, no, I'll leave some
cash in the bag, all right.


937
01:19:58.632 --> 01:20:02.158
I'll throw them off the trail for a bit.
They'll think that's everything.


938
01:20:02.201 --> 01:20:05.639
By the time they realized I stashed
some stuff away, it'll be too late.


939
01:20:05.683 --> 01:20:07.424
You see?

940
01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:09.987
Now, you gotta be quick back here,
and you need to pick the rest.


941
01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:12.864
Okay.

942
01:20:14.344 --> 01:20:15.911
But you have to tell me.

943
01:20:27.835 --> 01:20:29.707
Tell you what?

944
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:30.926
The truth.

945
01:20:34.016 --> 01:20:35.016
Aaron.

946
01:20:37.802 --> 01:20:38.802
Yeah.

947
01:20:41.501 --> 01:20:42.501
I'm here.

948
01:20:44.069 --> 01:20:46.289
Why did you leave Elijah behind?

949
01:20:57.604 --> 01:20:58.736
He was shot.

950
01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:27.868
I didn't think
you'd call back.


951
01:22:30.393 --> 01:22:31.916
It won't be long now.

952
01:22:33.787 --> 01:22:35.354
Please surrender, Aaron.

953
01:22:42.231 --> 01:22:44.059
I need to tell you something.

954
01:22:49.151 --> 01:22:50.152
Okay.

955
01:22:52.154 --> 01:22:53.416
Elijah.

956
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:58.682
What about him?

957
01:23:06.646 --> 01:23:07.646
Aaron?

958
01:23:16.221 --> 01:23:17.527
Aaron, what about him?

959
01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:24.010
Aaron!

960
01:23:28.799 --> 01:23:29.843
I'm here.

961
01:23:29.887 --> 01:23:31.062
What about Elijah?

962
01:23:37.851 --> 01:23:38.852
He's dead.

963
01:23:40.202 --> 01:23:41.202
What?

964
01:23:43.422 --> 01:23:44.902
No, no...

965
01:23:46.991 --> 01:23:48.949
No! Oh, my god.

966
01:23:51.038 --> 01:23:52.562
Oh, my God.

967
01:23:54.303 --> 01:23:58.002
No! No, no!

968
01:23:59.351 --> 01:24:00.918
No!

969
01:24:00.961 --> 01:24:03.181
No, no.

970
01:24:03.225 --> 01:24:05.140
I don't understand.

971
01:24:07.185 --> 01:24:08.752
I have to tell you, Laura.

972
01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:14.410
No! I don't understand.

973
01:24:14.453 --> 01:24:15.933
What happened?

974
01:24:18.544 --> 01:24:19.632
Laura.

975
01:24:20.981 --> 01:24:23.375
Tell me what, Aaron,
what happened?


976
01:24:27.423 --> 01:24:29.642
I wanted to tell you sooner.

977
01:24:29.686 --> 01:24:31.775
Aaron, what happened?

978
01:24:37.215 --> 01:24:40.305
What happened? No...

979
01:24:42.002 --> 01:24:43.482
What happened?

980
01:24:46.659 --> 01:24:48.444
Aaron, what happened?

981
01:24:50.576 --> 01:24:52.187
On the ground everybody, down!

982
01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:54.817
- On the fucking ground!
- Get down on the floor.


983
01:24:54.841 --> 01:24:57.104
- Whoa, whoa.
- Get down on the fucking floor.


984
01:24:57.148 --> 01:24:59.629
Don't look at me,
stay on the ground.


985
01:24:59.672 --> 01:25:00.978
The drawers!

986
01:25:01.021 --> 01:25:02.477
- Alright, alright.
- Open the jewel cache.


987
01:25:02.501 --> 01:25:04.634
- Open your bag!
- Get back.


988
01:25:14.557 --> 01:25:15.925
Give me all
the cash you have.


989
01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:18.996
- That's it? That's it?
- Yeah.


990
01:25:21.651 --> 01:25:23.218
Son of a bitch.

991
01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.743
Eli, what the fuck
are you doing?


992
01:25:26.786 --> 01:25:28.875
What are you doing, bro?
Go get the stuff.


993
01:25:28.919 --> 01:25:30.573
- Fuck, man. Don't...
- Go get it!


994
01:25:39.538 --> 01:25:43.107
Eli, I've got... Oh, God!

995
01:26:13.616 --> 01:26:14.834
Eli, no.

996
01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:16.009
No!

997
01:26:16.053 --> 01:26:17.315
- Eli!
- No!


998
01:26:17.359 --> 01:26:18.447
- Eli, don't!
- No!


999
01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:20.927
Eli!

1000
01:26:53.351 --> 01:26:54.352
Laura.

1001
01:26:54.396 --> 01:26:56.833
Aaron...

1002
01:26:58.356 --> 01:27:02.360
What... What have you...

1003
01:27:02.404 --> 01:27:07.017
Aaron, no. Aaron.

1004
01:27:08.366 --> 01:27:09.933
You killed him.

1005
01:27:11.674 --> 01:27:14.851
You killed him. Eli is not...

1006
01:27:14.894 --> 01:27:17.854
You killed my brother?

1007
01:27:17.897 --> 01:27:19.246
Yes.

1008
01:27:19.290 --> 01:27:23.033
Why, why, why?

1009
01:27:24.774 --> 01:27:27.951
- Why, why, why?
- It was only to help.


1010
01:27:27.994 --> 01:27:29.387
He's gone.

1011
01:27:29.431 --> 01:27:31.389
It was only supposed to help.

1012
01:27:31.433 --> 01:27:33.173
Elijah's gone.

1013
01:27:36.525 --> 01:27:37.743
Laura...

1014
01:27:39.528 --> 01:27:43.619
There is nothing I wouldn't
give to trade all this.


1015
01:27:43.662 --> 01:27:45.621
- You killed him.
- I had to.


1016
01:27:47.536 --> 01:27:51.148
You asked about destiny,
well, this is mine.


1017
01:27:51.191 --> 01:27:55.370
I didn't ask for this, Aaron,
I don't want this.


1018
01:27:55.413 --> 01:27:58.329
And I'm giving up
my life for you,


1019
01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.985
my freedom for you,

1020
01:28:03.465 --> 01:28:06.293
everything for you.

1021
01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:11.473
I didn't want to either.
But I had to.


1022
01:28:14.606 --> 01:28:18.349
I'd stop Elijah hundred times
if it meant protecting you.


1023
01:28:20.264 --> 01:28:21.265
Laura...

1024
01:28:24.616 --> 01:28:26.270
I'd do it again if I had to.

1025
01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.099
I'm gonna be sick.

1026
01:28:31.710 --> 01:28:32.842
You have to take it.

1027
01:28:34.147 --> 01:28:36.628
You have to take the money.

1028
01:28:36.672 --> 01:28:38.108
What? No!

1029
01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:39.936
I can't think about it.

1030
01:28:39.979 --> 01:28:43.418
No, not I'm not gonna
take it, I won't take it.


1031
01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:44.984
- I don't want it.
- You have to.


1032
01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:46.421
I can't...

1033
01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:51.948
How, Aaron, how could you do
this and still say you love me?

1034
01:28:51.991 --> 01:28:53.166
You don't love me.

1035
01:28:54.341 --> 01:28:55.604
You don't love me.

1036
01:28:58.171 --> 01:29:00.173
You don't love me.

1037
01:29:00.217 --> 01:29:01.566
I have nothing left to give.

1038
01:29:04.874 --> 01:29:07.529
I have nothing left to give you.

1039
01:29:07.572 --> 01:29:10.619
And somehow you managed to
take everything away from me.


1040
01:29:12.403 --> 01:29:14.231
I only wanted a future.

1041
01:29:16.625 --> 01:29:18.583
We had a future.

1042
01:29:21.543 --> 01:29:23.153
It may not have been bright,

1043
01:29:25.634 --> 01:29:26.809
but it was ours.

1044
01:29:39.299 --> 01:29:40.431
You have to take it.

1045
01:29:41.954 --> 01:29:43.173
Take it.

1046
01:29:45.828 --> 01:29:50.310
Promise, promise me, Laura.

1047
01:29:50.354 --> 01:29:51.398
Promise me, Laura!

1048
01:29:51.442 --> 01:29:53.662
Promise me!

1049
01:30:37.619 --> 01:30:39.011
I promise.

1050
01:30:48.499 --> 01:30:50.066
Now, breathe.

1051
01:30:57.116 --> 01:30:58.248
Aaron!

1052
01:31:01.294 --> 01:31:02.339
Aaron!

1053
01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:05.385
Come back.

1054
01:31:07.257 --> 01:31:08.257
I'm here.

1055
01:31:09.346 --> 01:31:10.521
I'm still here.

1056
01:31:12.784 --> 01:31:14.003
I promise.

1057
01:31:17.659 --> 01:31:19.661
I promise.
