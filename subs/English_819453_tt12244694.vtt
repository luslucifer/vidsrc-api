- Mom, I'm gonna be late.

15
00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:35.075
- Since when are you in
a hurry to get to school?


16
00:02:35.162 --> 00:02:36.772
- I don't want detention.

17
00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.123
Drake and I are playing
"Hunters Watch" after school.


18
00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:41.690
- Boys.

19
00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:47.566
- Have you see my blue notebook,
the one with the spirals?


20
00:02:47.653 --> 00:02:49.089
- You are not making us
late for school again.


21
00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:50.917
- You put it in your
backpack at breakfast.


22
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.440
- Oh yeah.

23
00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:56.531
- Your lunch.

24
00:02:56.618 --> 00:02:58.011
- Thanks.

25
00:02:58.098 --> 00:02:59.839
- It's 8:02, mom!

26
00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:00.927
- Hey.

27
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.668
Yeah, I finished it.

28
00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:04.800
It was only 20 questions.

29
00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:06.933
- Okay, everybody in the car.

30
00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.718
Was anybody gonna tell me?

31
00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:11.938
Brennan.

32
00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:15.811
Okay, sure.

33
00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:16.987
I'll head that way now.

34
00:03:17.074 --> 00:03:18.423
Is this a 55A?

35
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.250
- A homicide?

36
00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:23.863
- Okay, I'll be right there.

37
00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.866
- Someone died?

38
00:03:26.953 --> 00:03:29.390
- An elderly woman
up on Briar Rock.


39
00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:31.349
She's a mountain
woman, there's no ID.


40
00:03:31.436 --> 00:03:33.264
- There's still mountain
people living up there?


41
00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:35.222
- A few, as far as
anyone can tell.


42
00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:36.180
- Why are you getting the call?

43
00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.833
- The store manager in town

44
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.358
thinks she may have been
keeping a boy on her homestead.


45
00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.273
If so, he's up there all alone.

46
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.622
- Well then you better hurry.

47
00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.015
I'll run the kids to school.

48
00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:46.538
- What about your
writing deadline?


49
00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:47.930
- It's all up here.

50
00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:49.410
Typing it out as
just a formality.


51
00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:50.237
- Thank you.

52
00:03:53.893 --> 00:03:54.720
- I'm gonna be late.

53
00:03:54.807 --> 00:03:55.808
- And I'm gone.

54
00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:57.027
Good luck finding the boy.

55
00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:58.506
- [Janelle] If there is one.

56
00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:02.771
- Store manager said
she ordered her supplies


57
00:04:02.858 --> 00:04:04.860
under the name of the
Lila Mae Whittaker.


58
00:04:04.947 --> 00:04:05.905
- So we have an ID then?

59
00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:08.734
- It could be an alias.

60
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:10.910
He also had an order
from Nathaniel Hawthorne.


61
00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:13.913
Coroner's best guess is
she was in her mid 80's.


62
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.307
- So why are we
assuming she had a kid?


63
00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:18.744
- She ordered a copy
of "Tom Sawyer".


64
00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:20.398
- [Janelle] So she likes Twain.

65
00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:23.792
- And a pair of size

66
00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.881
- The storekeeper is
quite the detective.


67
00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:27.448
He should come work for us.

68
00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:28.884
- Well, this may all
be a wild goose chase,


69
00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:30.756
but if we suspect
there's a minor involved,


70
00:04:30.843 --> 00:04:32.062
we have to check it out.

71
00:04:33.498 --> 00:04:34.760
- We sure this is
the right path?


72
00:04:34.847 --> 00:04:36.022
- I have no idea.

73
00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:38.416
According to the chopper survey,

74
00:04:38.503 --> 00:04:39.895
there's supposed to be
a thick cluster of trees


75
00:04:39.982 --> 00:04:42.159
over that ridge there
that could cover a house.


76
00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:43.160
Let's check it out.

77
00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:47.207
- Hold on.

78
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.993
You better come look at this.

79
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.345
- Well, I'll be.

80
00:04:55.868 --> 00:04:57.522
Jeremiah Whittaker.

81
00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:00.046
Could be the husband,
this isn't new.


82
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.656
Let's keep moving.

83
00:05:01.743 --> 00:05:03.136
Keep your eyes open.

84
00:05:03.223 --> 00:05:04.572
Most people up
here are friendly,


85
00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.618
but a few wave hello
with their shotguns.


86
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:11.362
[gentle music]

87
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:19.848
[ominous music]

88
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:41.783
- Sheriff's department.

89
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.871
Anyone home?

90
00:05:48.268 --> 00:05:49.051
Hello?

91
00:05:51.053 --> 00:05:53.534
- We don't have a
warrant to go in.


92
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.796
Let's comb the property.

93
00:05:57.103 --> 00:05:59.932
[ominous music]

94
00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:09.898
There's definitely
someone living here.


95
00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:12.858
[ominous music]

96
00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:13.859
Brennan.

97
00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:14.947
- On it.

98
00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:18.472
[dramatic music]

99
00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:51.549
It's a male between 15 and 18.

100
00:06:51.636 --> 00:06:52.985
He just vanished.

101
00:06:53.072 --> 00:06:54.247
- All right, I'll
head down this way.


102
00:06:54.334 --> 00:06:55.944
He may cut back to the cabin.

103
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.163
- I'll do a sweep here and
meet you back up the hill.


104
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.599
- Be careful.

105
00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:00.079
We have no idea what
this kid is like.


106
00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:01.950
Don't hesitate to defend
yourself if you have to.


107
00:07:03.038 --> 00:07:05.867
[ominous music]

108
00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:20.882
- You gave me quite
a chase there.


109
00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:23.798
My name is Deputy Brennan.

110
00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:25.844
I'm with the County
Sheriff's department.


111
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:26.845
We need to talk.

112
00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:29.456
I'm not here to hurt you.

113
00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:31.545
I just need to make
sure you're all right.


114
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.245
Any chance you could
come out of there?


115
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:41.033
Do you know a Lila
Mae Whittaker?


116
00:07:43.078 --> 00:07:44.819
- Yes.

117
00:07:44.906 --> 00:07:45.864
- Is she your grandmother?

118
00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:48.867
- No, she looks after me though.

119
00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:52.653
- There's no easy
way to say this.


120
00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.569
- She passed, didn't she?

121
00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.050
- I'm afraid so.

122
00:07:59.007 --> 00:07:59.921
Are you here alone?

123
00:08:02.663 --> 00:08:04.143
- Pap passed awhile back.

124
00:08:06.493 --> 00:08:08.539
- I found this wooden bird.

125
00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:12.282
I think maybe you dropped it.

126
00:08:18.984 --> 00:08:20.638
It's beautiful.

127
00:08:20.725 --> 00:08:21.465
Did you make it?

128
00:08:23.684 --> 00:08:24.685
- It's gran's.

129
00:08:25.947 --> 00:08:28.167
Pap whittled it for her.

130
00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:29.995
- What about your mom or dad?

131
00:08:30.082 --> 00:08:31.649
They ever come around?

132
00:08:31.736 --> 00:08:32.824
- No, I ain't never,

133
00:08:34.129 --> 00:08:36.784
I haven't ever seen them.

134
00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:38.395
- [Callier] Brennan,
have you spotted him?


135
00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:39.396
- Oh, it's okay.

136
00:08:39.483 --> 00:08:40.571
It's okay, it's just my radio.

137
00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:42.877
- I've read about radios.

138
00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:45.750
- Yeah, he's here.

139
00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:48.753
- On my way.

140
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.407
- No, no, don't
come down just yet.


141
00:08:50.494 --> 00:08:51.799
We're talking.

142
00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:52.844
- [Callier] Are you good?

143
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:54.454
- Yeah, he seems okay.

144
00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:58.197
- [Finch] Who are
you talking to?


145
00:08:58.284 --> 00:08:59.894
- The county sheriff.

146
00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:02.070
He's been helping
me look for you.


147
00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:03.985
- Does it play music, too?

148
00:09:04.072 --> 00:09:04.943
- My radio?

149
00:09:06.074 --> 00:09:07.380
No.

150
00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:08.903
No, it's not that
kind of a radio.


151
00:09:09.817 --> 00:09:10.731
Do you like music?

152
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.125
My phone can play music.

153
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.434
- Your telephone?

154
00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:20.698
- Yeah.

155
00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:22.352
See?

156
00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:25.703
- I don't see any wires.

157
00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:29.141
- Have you ever been off
this mountain before?


158
00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:30.664
- No, ma'am.

159
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:33.406
My gran said if ever
I leave this mountain


160
00:09:33.493 --> 00:09:35.626
folks down below might
never let me come back.


161
00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:39.369
- You said you
read about radios.


162
00:09:39.456 --> 00:09:40.326
Do you like to read?

163
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.936
- Yes, ma'am.

164
00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:44.896
I have books on a
shelf near my bed.


165
00:09:44.983 --> 00:09:47.768
I have bunches of
them, 12 in all.


166
00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:49.640
I've read them so many times,

167
00:09:49.727 --> 00:09:51.032
I can almost say them by rote,

168
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.079
except'n the Bible.

169
00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:55.863
I'm still working
on learning it.


170
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.126
Now that's a big one.

171
00:09:58.213 --> 00:10:01.521
But my gran wants me to
have that one right up here


172
00:10:01.608 --> 00:10:03.523
so that I can use it
whenever I need it.


173
00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.047
She promised me

174
00:10:06.134 --> 00:10:09.399
that when I finished reading
the whole thing cover to cover


175
00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:11.096
that she would
use her wool money


176
00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:13.315
to buy me a copy of Tom...

177
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:17.842
- What's your name?

178
00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:20.018
- Finch.

179
00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:20.932
- Oh, like the bird.

180
00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:26.285
- My gran raised a baby bird
she found alone in the woods.


181
00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:28.287
She used to say that
when I was little,


182
00:10:28.374 --> 00:10:30.289
I reminded her of the finch.

183
00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:32.596
So that's where she got my name.

184
00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:36.295
- Look Finch, I'm
afraid it's time to go.


185
00:10:36.382 --> 00:10:39.777
- Oh, well thanks
for looking after me.


186
00:10:39.864 --> 00:10:41.866
Maybe you could come
visit'n again sometime.


187
00:10:41.953 --> 00:10:43.998
- No, no, that's
not what I mean.


188
00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:46.000
We're gonna need
you to come with us.


189
00:10:46.087 --> 00:10:47.524
- No, I'll be fine here.

190
00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:49.264
I can take care of myself.

191
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:50.918
I like it here.

192
00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:54.444
- I know you do, but you see
I'm responsible for you now


193
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:55.880
and I have to make sure

194
00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:57.403
that you have enough
good food to eat,


195
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.839
that you get a good education.

196
00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:01.755
- Well there's plenty
of food to be had here.


197
00:11:01.842 --> 00:11:04.323
And I've got my
books to learn from.


198
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.152
- But you said you
already knew them all.


199
00:11:07.239 --> 00:11:08.719
Wouldn't you like
to read new books,


200
00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:11.330
go to a library?

201
00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:12.940
- To a library?

202
00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:14.986
- Yeah, there they have
hundreds and hundreds of books


203
00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:19.120
about anything you can
imagine and they're all free.


204
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.209
- Hundreds?

205
00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:29.435
But what about the
homestead and the animals?


206
00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.132
I have to stay here.

207
00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:33.265
I have to take
care of everything.


208
00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:35.093
- We'll resettle
the animals for you.


209
00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:39.314
- I don't know.

210
00:11:40.838 --> 00:11:42.361
- [Callier] Brennan,
we need to head out.


211
00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:44.319
- Finch, it's time.

212
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.368
Sheriff's waiting.

213
00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:52.980
- It's not for good.

214
00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:55.940
I'm coming back.

215
00:11:56.027 --> 00:11:56.680
- Okay.

216
00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:02.250
- If you did your reading last
night, the quiz will be easy.


217
00:12:02.337 --> 00:12:03.991
Thomas Jefferson once said

218
00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:06.777
nothing can stop the man with
the right mental attitude


219
00:12:06.864 --> 00:12:08.735
from achieving his goal.

220
00:12:08.822 --> 00:12:10.911
Nothing on earth can help,

221
00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:12.913
Toby clear your desk, please.

222
00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:16.047
See me after class.

223
00:12:24.098 --> 00:12:26.797
[bell ringing]

224
00:12:33.499 --> 00:12:34.282
Sit.

225
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.113
Toby, you have not turned in

226
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.854
your last four
homework assignments


227
00:12:40.941 --> 00:12:43.378
and you are now
failing this class.


228
00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:44.902
You're capable of passing.

229
00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:48.079
I've seen what you can do
when you apply yourself.


230
00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:51.082
Is something preventing
you from doing your work?


231
00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:51.952
Is there a problem at home?

232
00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.650
- No.

233
00:12:53.737 --> 00:12:55.216
- Look, I'm willing
to work with you,


234
00:12:55.303 --> 00:12:57.044
but you have to meet me halfway.

235
00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:59.046
I will take your back
work at a reduced grade


236
00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:01.048
if you get it into me by Monday.

237
00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:03.094
Otherwise I'll have to call
a parent teacher conference


238
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:04.922
and sort this out.

239
00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:06.924
Can I give you another
piece of advice?


240
00:13:09.535 --> 00:13:11.885
Take up a sport, join a club.

241
00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:13.495
The other kids might
include you more


242
00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:14.932
if they got to know you

243
00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:16.107
a little bit better
outside of class.


244
00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:17.456
- Can I go now?

245
00:13:17.543 --> 00:13:19.023
- Monday, that's the deadline.

246
00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:26.030
[phone ringing]

247
00:13:26.117 --> 00:13:27.161
- His first time in a car.

248
00:13:27.248 --> 00:13:28.728
Won't this be fun?

249
00:13:28.815 --> 00:13:30.774
Hines, I need my car detailed
and get CPS down here.


250
00:13:30.861 --> 00:13:32.166
- [Janelle] And
get him some water


251
00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:33.907
and something to
settle with stomach.


252
00:13:36.301 --> 00:13:38.129
- What is this place?

253
00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:39.957
- [Callier] Has
anybody seen Janie?


254
00:13:40.044 --> 00:13:41.611
- [Janelle] Finch.

255
00:13:43.787 --> 00:13:45.702
- Janie, where's my case
file from yesterday?


256
00:13:45.789 --> 00:13:46.572
- I'm on it.

257
00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:03.197
- Extension 401, please.

258
00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:05.417
This is Janelle Brennan.

259
00:14:07.593 --> 00:14:08.507
Yes, I'll hold.

260
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.430
Finch.

261
00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:22.739
Jeff, you got him flaming hot
chips to settle his stomach?


262
00:14:22.826 --> 00:14:24.001
- It helps me.

263
00:14:25.785 --> 00:14:26.743
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

264
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.788
- Steve, I'm glad to see you.

265
00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:30.355
Finch, this is Steve Anderson

266
00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:31.878
with Child Protective Services.

267
00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:33.445
- Child Protective?

268
00:14:33.532 --> 00:14:34.838
- It's an agency designed
to help young people


269
00:14:34.925 --> 00:14:35.882
in your situation.

270
00:14:35.969 --> 00:14:37.449
- My situation?

271
00:14:37.536 --> 00:14:38.929
- Yeah, you and I are
gonna go to my office,


272
00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:40.539
I'm gonna get some
information from you.


273
00:14:40.626 --> 00:14:41.975
Then we'll have a
doctor check you out


274
00:14:42.062 --> 00:14:43.498
and get you assigned
to a foster family.


275
00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:44.935
- Foster family?

276
00:14:45.022 --> 00:14:46.676
- Steve, this is all
very new to Finch.


277
00:14:46.763 --> 00:14:49.461
You may need to go slowly
and explain things in detail.


278
00:14:49.548 --> 00:14:50.331
- Of course.

279
00:14:50.418 --> 00:14:51.506
This is Paul Kramer.

280
00:14:51.593 --> 00:14:52.812
He's one of our foster parents.

281
00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:53.944
I need to take this.

282
00:14:55.554 --> 00:14:56.337
- Foster parents?

283
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:59.471
- You'll need to be
placed in a temporary home


284
00:14:59.558 --> 00:15:01.603
with a family who
will look after you.


285
00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:03.867
- But you said that you
were responsible for me.


286
00:15:06.043 --> 00:15:07.871
- I didn't mean me personally.

287
00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.307
- But that's what you said.

288
00:15:09.394 --> 00:15:10.482
- Finch, it'll be all right.

289
00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:11.613
I know Paul Kramer.

290
00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:13.093
He has a wonderful family

291
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.095
who will make sure you
have everything you need.


292
00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:16.227
- No, no, no, I
want to go back now.


293
00:15:16.314 --> 00:15:17.663
- Whoa, easy, easy.

294
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.446
- I just need to go home.

295
00:15:18.533 --> 00:15:19.970
- Finch stop.

296
00:15:20.057 --> 00:15:20.927
- [Male] No one's gonna
hurt you, just calm down.


297
00:15:21.014 --> 00:15:21.885
- [Janelle] Leave him alone.

298
00:15:21.972 --> 00:15:24.017
- I really need to go home.

299
00:15:24.104 --> 00:15:25.889
- Call psych, we're
bringing him in right now.


300
00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:27.847
- He doesn't understand
what you're doing.


301
00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:29.414
- [Finch] Let go of me.

302
00:15:29.501 --> 00:15:31.503
- Just explain it to him, Steve.

303
00:15:37.074 --> 00:15:39.641
Hey, sorry I'm late, crazy day.

304
00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:40.555
- Welcome home.

305
00:15:41.513 --> 00:15:43.950
[gentle music]

306
00:15:47.258 --> 00:15:50.043
- Lisa, the school called to
say you failed every class


307
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.263
and you're gonna have to
repeat the sixth grade.


308
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:53.264
- Okay.

309
00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:55.309
- Jack, NASA called.

310
00:15:55.396 --> 00:15:57.094
They definitely want you
for the Mars mission.


311
00:15:57.181 --> 00:15:58.443
You leave in the morning.

312
00:15:59.966 --> 00:16:01.489
- Mom, you're home.

313
00:16:01.576 --> 00:16:02.839
- Oh, hi mom.

314
00:16:02.926 --> 00:16:03.622
- There are my babies.

315
00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:05.189
Devices down.

316
00:16:06.886 --> 00:16:09.106
So let's hear it.

317
00:16:09.193 --> 00:16:09.976
How was school?

318
00:16:11.543 --> 00:16:13.197
- The teacher called Heath
and me up to the board


319
00:16:13.284 --> 00:16:15.025
to solve a quadratic equation.

320
00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:16.896
- What's a quadratic equation?

321
00:16:16.983 --> 00:16:21.379
- It's a complicated
math problem.


322
00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:22.815
And?

323
00:16:22.902 --> 00:16:24.512
- Heath gives me
this yeah right look


324
00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:27.080
'cause he thinks he's the
smartest guy in the class.


325
00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:27.907
- And?

326
00:16:27.994 --> 00:16:29.604
- Nailed it.

327
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:31.998
Heath had to get help from
the teacher to finish it.


328
00:16:32.085 --> 00:16:33.826
- Up top, yes.

329
00:16:33.913 --> 00:16:35.523
- Where's Toby?

330
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.266
- He lost track of
time over at Drake's.


331
00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:40.877
He's on his way home now.

332
00:16:40.964 --> 00:16:42.226
- [Janelle] Well,
this looks wonderful.


333
00:16:42.313 --> 00:16:43.836
I am starving.

334
00:16:43.923 --> 00:16:48.014
- Did you find what
you were looking for?


335
00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:50.887
- Yeah, we found him.

336
00:16:50.974 --> 00:16:53.106
- Dad finished chapter

337
00:16:53.193 --> 00:16:53.933
- He did?

338
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.413
That's wonderful.

339
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.415
- Yep, I have one
more chapter to finish


340
00:16:57.502 --> 00:16:59.460
before the manuscript
deadline on Monday.


341
00:16:59.547 --> 00:17:01.071
- We have to keep the
house quiet this weekend


342
00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:02.550
so dad can write.

343
00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:04.683
I volunteered to
go stay at Dina's.


344
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.250
- Oh, that's quite
the sacrifice.


345
00:17:06.337 --> 00:17:08.861
- It's vital to
support the arts.


346
00:17:08.948 --> 00:17:10.820
- And I said that if
Toby makes me mad,


347
00:17:10.907 --> 00:17:13.779
I'll scream into my
pillow so I won't bug dad.


348
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.825
- I like the way
you're planning ahead.


349
00:17:20.438 --> 00:17:21.874
- You're almost an hour late.

350
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:22.962
- Sorry.

351
00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:25.617
- How was your day at school?

352
00:17:25.704 --> 00:17:26.531
- Fine.

353
00:17:26.618 --> 00:17:27.837
- Oh, I almost forgot,

354
00:17:27.924 --> 00:17:30.143
I got an A on my
science report on frogs.


355
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.493
- Hey, congratulations, champ.

356
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.973
Toby, you never told me

357
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.019
how you did on your
math test last week.


358
00:17:36.106 --> 00:17:37.716
- You never asked.

359
00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:44.766
- So Deputy Brennan,
AKA supermom,


360
00:17:44.854 --> 00:17:48.988
found a lost boy up in the
mountains today and rescued him.


361
00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:50.207
- I don't know about rescuing

362
00:17:50.294 --> 00:17:52.426
but yes, we brought down a boy

363
00:17:52.513 --> 00:17:53.732
who'd been living
up in the mountains.


364
00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:54.820
- Like Mowgli?

365
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.387
Was he raised by wolves?

366
00:17:56.474 --> 00:17:57.779
- Seriously?

367
00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:00.043
- No, Jack, he had
a human family.


368
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.393
- Was he wild and
grungy looking?


369
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.787
- No, there was
nothing wild about him.


370
00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:06.832
- He's probably dumb as a rock

371
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.225
if he's never been in school.

372
00:18:08.312 --> 00:18:10.749
- He's a normal boy
just like everyone else.


373
00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:12.359
- No one's saying-

374
00:18:12.446 --> 00:18:15.101
- He's a bright caring young
man with human feelings.


375
00:18:15.188 --> 00:18:17.277
I don't know why
everyone has to judge him


376
00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:18.713
because he's different.

377
00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:23.893
- Fine, we get it.

378
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.894
- Sorry mom.

379
00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:27.984
- No, I'm sorry.

380
00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:29.550
I just-

381
00:18:29.637 --> 00:18:30.943
- So what kinds of things
does he like to do?


382
00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.250
- Yeah, does he hunt bears?

383
00:18:33.337 --> 00:18:34.816
- I don't know.

384
00:18:34.904 --> 00:18:37.950
He raises sheep and pigs.

385
00:18:38.037 --> 00:18:39.038
He likes to go fishing.

386
00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:41.911
But mostly he loves to read.

387
00:18:41.998 --> 00:18:43.956
- Sounds fun.

388
00:18:44.043 --> 00:18:46.002
- I don't know, that
sounds pretty good to me.


389
00:18:46.089 --> 00:18:47.612
Sounds like my kind of kid.

390
00:18:57.187 --> 00:18:59.972
- Brennan, I need you to
report on the Fitch boy ASAP.


391
00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:02.932
CPS wants the file in
front of the judge today.


392
00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:04.324
- Can we move Finch
out of cell four?


393
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:05.804
I've got a perp coming in.

394
00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:07.066
- What do you mean cell four?

395
00:19:09.939 --> 00:19:11.331
- I'll be in my office.

396
00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:16.510
Before you start,

397
00:19:16.597 --> 00:19:17.990
the kid had to sleep in
a jail cell last night


398
00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:20.166
because I didn't have any
place else to put him.


399
00:19:20.253 --> 00:19:21.037
- What about the Kramer's?

400
00:19:21.124 --> 00:19:22.560
- Couldn't take him.

401
00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:23.474
They said they couldn't
handle his special needs.


402
00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:24.388
- So you put him in jail?

403
00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:25.911
- For his own safety.

404
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.218
We did everything we could
to make him comfortable.


405
00:19:28.305 --> 00:19:30.785
- Don't worry, CPS has already
found foster placement,


406
00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:31.873
he's going there tonight.

407
00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:32.918
- I should hope so.

408
00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:33.658
Who's taking him?

409
00:19:35.051 --> 00:19:36.704
- He's going to
the Bartlow house.


410
00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:38.184
- That can't be right.

411
00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:39.925
The Bartlow house is shut down.

412
00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.840
I busted him for
possession two weeks ago.


413
00:19:41.927 --> 00:19:43.885
- Nope, he got out
on a technicality.


414
00:19:43.973 --> 00:19:46.062
- You're gonna send
the boy to Bartlow?


415
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:48.412
What was Charles
Manson's house full?


416
00:19:48.499 --> 00:19:49.413
- It's CPS' call.

417
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.805
I don't have a choice.

418
00:19:50.892 --> 00:19:51.719
- Bartlow is not a
real foster home.


419
00:19:51.806 --> 00:19:53.112
It's a drug cartel.

420
00:19:53.199 --> 00:19:54.896
He uses those kids
to make his runs.


421
00:19:54.984 --> 00:19:56.768
- We don't have a say in this.

422
00:19:56.855 --> 00:19:57.987
- Maybe you don't, but I do.

423
00:19:58.074 --> 00:19:59.466
- Brennan.

424
00:19:59.553 --> 00:20:01.120
- No, you have seen
him Bob, he's lost.


425
00:20:01.207 --> 00:20:03.296
He wouldn't last one
night at Bartlow's.


426
00:20:03.383 --> 00:20:04.689
- [Callier] Janelle.

427
00:20:04.776 --> 00:20:05.429
- Hines, forward
my calls, will you?


428
00:20:05.516 --> 00:20:06.865
- Sure thing.

429
00:20:06.952 --> 00:20:07.997
- [Janelle] I'll be
at the courthouse.


430
00:20:08.084 --> 00:20:08.867
- Hines!

431
00:20:12.827 --> 00:20:13.785
- I'm sorry, lieutenant,

432
00:20:13.872 --> 00:20:14.960
Judge Raymond is in court today.

433
00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:15.830
Can I make you an appointment?

434
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:16.831
- This is urgent.

435
00:20:16.918 --> 00:20:18.790
I can't make it, Marguerite.

436
00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:22.315
Marguerite, am I
glad to see you.


437
00:20:22.402 --> 00:20:23.360
- Janelle, how are you?

438
00:20:23.447 --> 00:20:24.709
- Do you have the CPS case

439
00:20:24.796 --> 00:20:26.885
for the Finch boy
from Briar Rock?


440
00:20:26.972 --> 00:20:29.540
- No, Jason in the state office
is handling that one, why?


441
00:20:29.627 --> 00:20:31.107
- Can you get it?

442
00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:33.500
They placed the boy at
Ernest Barlow's house.


443
00:20:33.587 --> 00:20:35.067
- I thought Bartlow was in jail.

444
00:20:35.154 --> 00:20:38.331
- Exactly, he has got
to go someplace else.


445
00:20:38.418 --> 00:20:41.073
- Even if I could get
the case reassigned,


446
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.076
once he's placed, I can't
remove him without cause.


447
00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:45.251
- Cause?

448
00:20:45.338 --> 00:20:46.905
You know what Bartlow is.

449
00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:48.689
- He's never been convicted.

450
00:20:48.776 --> 00:20:51.301
Besides there's no place
else for the boy to go.


451
00:20:51.388 --> 00:20:52.128
- I'll take him.

452
00:20:52.215 --> 00:20:53.868
Place him with me.

453
00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:56.697
- Janelle, you have to be
certified for foster care.


454
00:20:56.784 --> 00:20:58.047
- I am.

455
00:20:58.134 --> 00:20:59.657
We are, Keith and
I are certified.


456
00:20:59.744 --> 00:21:01.180
We had to be before
we adopted Jackson.


457
00:21:01.267 --> 00:21:03.182
I could have the paperwork
to you within the hour.


458
00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:04.705
- I'm sorry.

459
00:21:04.792 --> 00:21:06.751
I don't like Bartlow
any more than you do,


460
00:21:06.838 --> 00:21:08.796
but rules are rules.

461
00:21:08.883 --> 00:21:10.233
And right now neither one of us

462
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.365
has the authority
to move the boy.


463
00:21:12.452 --> 00:21:14.628
So if you'll,
excuse me, I'm late.


464
00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:16.674
- Adoption.

465
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:18.937
- What?

466
00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:21.331
- If Finch was being adopted,

467
00:21:21.418 --> 00:21:23.246
he could be pulled
from Bartlow's.


468
00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:25.204
- That's true, but-

469
00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:27.685
- Okay, so we're adopting him.

470
00:21:27.772 --> 00:21:29.208
- Janelle-

471
00:21:29.295 --> 00:21:30.862
- You could transfer him
to us right away today.


472
00:21:30.949 --> 00:21:34.431
- You can't just pretend
to want to adopt.


473
00:21:34.518 --> 00:21:37.912
- It'll buy him some time until
I can find him a safer home.


474
00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:39.827
- What am I supposed
to tell the judge,


475
00:21:39.914 --> 00:21:41.612
or the boy for that matter?

476
00:21:41.699 --> 00:21:43.788
- That Keith and I
are giving him a home.


477
00:21:43.875 --> 00:21:45.529
- For how long?

478
00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.052
Keith doesn't even know

479
00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.836
that we're having this
conversation, does he?


480
00:21:48.923 --> 00:21:50.447
- For however long it takes.

481
00:21:50.534 --> 00:21:52.013
I promise you, Marguerite.

482
00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:54.407
I will not dump Finch
back into the system.


483
00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:57.236
I will take care of him until
a permanent home can be found.


484
00:21:58.716 --> 00:22:00.152
- I hope you know
what you're doing.


485
00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:01.893
- So you'll talk to Judge
Raymond this afternoon?


486
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.329
- I'll see what I can do,

487
00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:05.592
but I'm not making any promises.

488
00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:08.160
- Please, make it
happen, Marguerite.


489
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.956
- I don't know how
you pulled this off.


490
00:22:22.043 --> 00:22:23.697
- Don't ask.

491
00:22:23.784 --> 00:22:25.525
Hey, can we talk?

492
00:22:25.612 --> 00:22:26.961
- We'll leave you to it.

493
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:31.270
- Look, Finch-

494
00:22:31.357 --> 00:22:32.489
- I want to go home.

495
00:22:34.012 --> 00:22:36.362
- I'm afraid that's
not possible.


496
00:22:36.449 --> 00:22:38.495
- Are you gonna
lock me up again?


497
00:22:38.582 --> 00:22:39.931
Because if you don't,

498
00:22:40.018 --> 00:22:41.889
I'm going to find a way
back to that mountain.


499
00:22:41.976 --> 00:22:45.806
- Okay, okay, yeah,
I'll take you back.


500
00:22:45.893 --> 00:22:47.765
But before we go,

501
00:22:47.852 --> 00:22:49.810
I'd like you to come
to my house for dinner


502
00:22:49.897 --> 00:22:51.029
and meet my family.

503
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.250
- Your family?

504
00:22:54.337 --> 00:22:57.383
- Yeah, my husband
and my three kids.


505
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.907
I have a son who's
just your age.


506
00:22:59.994 --> 00:23:01.082
I'd like you to meet them.

507
00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:03.607
Will you do that for me?

508
00:23:05.652 --> 00:23:06.827
- And then we'll go back?

509
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.484
- If that's what you want, yes.

510
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.971
- Will we ride in the car again?

511
00:23:20.058 --> 00:23:21.538
- No, I completely understand.

512
00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:22.756
- Hi dad.

513
00:23:22.843 --> 00:23:25.368
- Shh, he's on the phone.

514
00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:26.717
- I'm gonna go say
hello to Lenny.


515
00:23:26.804 --> 00:23:28.066
- Rats don't talk.

516
00:23:28.153 --> 00:23:29.763
- He's not a rat,
he's a hamster.


517
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.765
- Oh, well in that case.

518
00:23:31.852 --> 00:23:33.376
- Well, I appreciate
you calling.


519
00:23:34.725 --> 00:23:36.205
- This smells delicious.

520
00:23:37.336 --> 00:23:38.816
I'm starving.

521
00:23:38.903 --> 00:23:40.252
- I thought you were staying
at Dina's this weekend.


522
00:23:40.339 --> 00:23:41.993
- Her brother decided
to come home from school


523
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.256
so they're having some
family time together.


524
00:23:45.301 --> 00:23:46.780
I'm going to my room.

525
00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:55.049
- That was your history teacher,

526
00:23:55.136 --> 00:23:56.790
Miss Barnett on the phone.

527
00:23:57.748 --> 00:23:58.444
- Oh?

528
00:24:01.186 --> 00:24:02.840
- Anything you want to tell me?

529
00:24:05.843 --> 00:24:06.844
- Dinner smells good.

530
00:24:08.846 --> 00:24:10.543
- Well, what do
you want me to say?


531
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.979
I'm sorry?

532
00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:13.807
I'm sorry I don't get
straight A's like Lisa.


533
00:24:13.894 --> 00:24:15.418
- Nobody expects that.

534
00:24:15.505 --> 00:24:17.681
- Yeah, because
I'm your dumb kid.


535
00:24:17.768 --> 00:24:19.030
- Oh, come on Toby.

536
00:24:19.117 --> 00:24:20.379
You know that's
not what I meant.


537
00:24:20.466 --> 00:24:21.902
- I'll be up in my room.

538
00:24:21.989 --> 00:24:23.382
- And then we'll sit
down with your mother


539
00:24:23.469 --> 00:24:25.123
and talk about this
after dinner tonight.


540
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.299
- You have a publishing
deadline, remember?


541
00:24:28.169 --> 00:24:29.910
- We'll talk.

542
00:24:29.997 --> 00:24:30.781
- Sure we will.

543
00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:38.441
- Lenny's gone, I can't
find him anywhere.


544
00:24:38.528 --> 00:24:40.617
- Did you close his cage after
you fed him this morning?


545
00:24:40.704 --> 00:24:41.661
- I thought I did.

546
00:24:41.748 --> 00:24:42.836
We have to find him.

547
00:24:56.067 --> 00:24:57.721
- You live here?

548
00:24:57.808 --> 00:24:58.591
- Yeah.

549
00:25:02.203 --> 00:25:03.030
- It's really big.

550
00:25:04.597 --> 00:25:07.557
It's like having the
outside on the inside.


551
00:25:10.386 --> 00:25:11.169
- Hmm.

552
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.042
I've never thought of
it that way before.


553
00:25:16.914 --> 00:25:18.916
You can put your stuff
down right over there.


554
00:25:19.003 --> 00:25:20.961
Let me go find everyone
and I'll introduce you.

[mysterious music]

556
00:25:58.216 --> 00:25:59.870
- I don't see him anywhere.

557
00:25:59.957 --> 00:26:01.915
- Hey, what's going on?

558
00:26:02.002 --> 00:26:03.439
- Lenny got out again.

559
00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:04.788
- Oh.

560
00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:06.877
- [Lisa] That rat
better not come near me.


561
00:26:06.964 --> 00:26:08.748
- He's not a rat.

562
00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:10.402
- Take Sebastian outside please

563
00:26:10.489 --> 00:26:12.404
and go finish the salad.

564
00:26:12.491 --> 00:26:13.753
Thank you.

565
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.928
- Have your checked your closet?

566
00:26:15.015 --> 00:26:16.495
He likes to get in your shoes.

567
00:26:16.582 --> 00:26:17.975
- No.

[screaming]

570
00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.014
- It attacked me.

571
00:26:57.101 --> 00:26:57.884
- I got it.

572
00:27:00.844 --> 00:27:01.758
- No!

573
00:27:01.845 --> 00:27:04.848
- You leave my hamster alone.

574
00:27:04.935 --> 00:27:07.851
- Jack, take Lenny and put
him back up in his cage.


575
00:27:07.938 --> 00:27:09.461
- Cage?

576
00:27:09.548 --> 00:27:12.638
You know you really should
try raising rabbits.


577
00:27:12.725 --> 00:27:14.858
That thing's hardly a mouthful.

578
00:27:14.945 --> 00:27:16.512
- Ugh.

579
00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:18.470
- No, hamsters, aren't
for eating, they're pets.


580
00:27:18.557 --> 00:27:19.950
- Who is this guy?

581
00:27:20.037 --> 00:27:22.082
- Oh, I'm sorry.

582
00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:25.216
Everyone, this is Finch.

583
00:27:25.303 --> 00:27:28.132
I invited him to stay
with us for dinner.


584
00:27:28.219 --> 00:27:30.613
- I'm Keith, hi.

585
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.310
So how do you two
know each other?


586
00:27:32.397 --> 00:27:35.269
- Finch is the young man I met
up on Briar Rock yesterday.


587
00:27:35.356 --> 00:27:36.880
- This is the
hillbilly you rescued?


588
00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:37.968
Ow!

589
00:27:38.055 --> 00:27:39.839
- Finch, these are our children,

590
00:27:39.926 --> 00:27:41.450
Lisa, Toby and Jack.

591
00:27:41.537 --> 00:27:42.842
You've met Lenny.

592
00:27:42.929 --> 00:27:43.713
- Dinner, huh?

593
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.757
What's he gonna eat?

594
00:27:44.844 --> 00:27:45.845
- We'll go put Lenny away.

595
00:27:45.932 --> 00:27:47.630
- And we'll finish up in here.

596
00:27:47.717 --> 00:27:49.283
Toby and Lisa, set
the table please.


597
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.025
And Finch, why don't
you go wash up?


598
00:27:57.901 --> 00:27:59.250
- Why is he here?

599
00:27:59.337 --> 00:28:01.295
- Because I invited him.

600
00:28:01.382 --> 00:28:05.299
So be polite and please do not
use the word hillbilly again.


601
00:28:05.386 --> 00:28:06.083
- Fine.

602
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.650
How about Yokel?

603
00:28:07.737 --> 00:28:08.955
- Toby.

604
00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:11.915
- Where did he
get those clothes?


605
00:28:12.002 --> 00:28:13.917
- I imagine they're homemade.

606
00:28:14.004 --> 00:28:15.701
That's how they do
things where he's from.


607
00:28:15.788 --> 00:28:16.920
- That's not all they do.

Look.

609
00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:19.792

- He's a total nut job.

612
00:28:24.144 --> 00:28:26.538
- Look, it's only for
a couple of hours.


613
00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:28.888
So let's try and make
him feel at home.


614

- Dina is not going
to believe this.

- This all looks wonderful.

- Yeah, I'm starving.

- What?

00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:52.695
- Finch, would you like
to say grace for us?

- Thank you God

for your bountiful provision

time with this nice family.

you like spaghetti.

I've met her, ma'am.

- Guests first.

00:29:15.413 --> 00:29:18.721
Finch, spaghetti isn't a person.

629
00:29:18.808 --> 00:29:19.896
It's the name of this food.

- Oh

631
00:29:21.375 --> 00:29:23.073
- It comes from a
country known as Italy.


632
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.945
- Actually, it originated
as Chinese noodles.


633
00:29:26.032 --> 00:29:27.947
Marco Polo introduced
it to the Italians


634
00:29:28.034 --> 00:29:29.514
when he returned from China.

635
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:31.864
- I don't know if I
like Chinese noodles.


636

- Don't be an idiot.

- "Oliver Twist".

- Dickens, he is my
favorite as well.

00:29:57.847 --> 00:29:59.675
- You have a library?

649
00:29:59.762 --> 00:30:01.154
- I do.

650
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:03.766
After dinner, we'll
take you on a tour.


651
00:30:03.853 --> 00:30:05.811
- Oh, speaking of books,

652
00:30:05.898 --> 00:30:07.944
how did your meeting
with the editor go?


653
00:30:08.031 --> 00:30:11.904
- Oh, he said as long as I
make my deadline this weekend,


654
00:30:11.991 --> 00:30:13.776
we're good to go for
a November release


655
00:30:13.863 --> 00:30:15.865
right before the
Christmas shopping season.


656
00:30:15.952 --> 00:30:17.954
[Slurps Loudly]

657
00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:24.134
- How do you like
spaghetti, Finch?


658
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:25.048
- Nice.

659
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.529
- Did I do something wrong?

660
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.098
- No.

661
00:30:34.231 --> 00:30:35.014
No.

662
00:30:38.017 --> 00:30:39.497
When in Rome.

663
00:30:39.584 --> 00:30:41.804
[laughing]

664
00:30:48.898 --> 00:30:51.030
- It tastes better this way.

665
00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:52.292
- Come on, Toby.

666
00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:54.730
- Toby, it's easy.

667
00:31:03.869 --> 00:31:05.044
I got some in my beard.

668
00:31:07.046 --> 00:31:08.874
I'll save it for later.

669
00:31:08.961 --> 00:31:10.963
[laughing]

670
00:31:12.748 --> 00:31:13.836
- They've finally snapped.

671
00:31:24.977 --> 00:31:26.457
- That kid is amazing.

672
00:31:26.544 --> 00:31:27.937
He took one look at the library

673
00:31:28.024 --> 00:31:29.678
and he got that expression

674
00:31:29.765 --> 00:31:31.854
that Jack gets when we
go to the pet store.


675
00:31:31.941 --> 00:31:34.813
- There are more books in there
than he ever knew existed.


676
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.162
- He picked up my "Walden"

677
00:31:36.249 --> 00:31:37.990
and started quoting
Thoreau to me.


678
00:31:38.077 --> 00:31:40.123
What teenager today can do that?

679
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.559
- [Janelle] Where is he now?

680
00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:43.735
- Jack took him out
to the tree house.


681
00:31:43.822 --> 00:31:46.607
- Listen, I have something
to tell you all about Finch.


682
00:31:46.695 --> 00:31:50.002
CPS took him in, but
he has no place to go.


683
00:31:50.089 --> 00:31:52.222
Last night, he slept in a
jail cell at the station


684
00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:53.876
because they couldn't
place him anywhere.


685
00:31:53.963 --> 00:31:57.706
Today, they were gonna place
him with a known drug felon.


686
00:31:57.793 --> 00:31:59.577
To stop that from happening,

687
00:31:59.664 --> 00:32:01.579
I told them that we
were adopting him.


688
00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:03.363
- What?

689
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.190
- He's staying?

690
00:32:04.277 --> 00:32:05.235
- Not with us?

691
00:32:05.322 --> 00:32:06.802
- We're not really adopting him.

692
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:09.195
It's just a cover until I
can find him a safe family


693
00:32:09.282 --> 00:32:10.501
that will take him permanently.

694
00:32:10.588 --> 00:32:11.545
- How could you decide this

695
00:32:11.632 --> 00:32:13.069
without talking to me first?

696
00:32:13.156 --> 00:32:15.811
- There was no time
and he was in danger.


697
00:32:15.898 --> 00:32:17.073
- I don't want him here.

698
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.117
- He's so weird.

699
00:32:18.204 --> 00:32:19.815
He wanted to eat Lenny.

700
00:32:19.902 --> 00:32:21.686
- He needs our help.

701
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:22.948
And it's just for
a little while.


702
00:32:23.035 --> 00:32:24.645
- I don't believe this.

703
00:32:24.733 --> 00:32:26.038
- At least with Jackson,

704
00:32:26.125 --> 00:32:27.823
you asked us before
we adopted him.


705
00:32:30.477 --> 00:32:31.740
- Keith, I'm sorry.

706
00:32:31.827 --> 00:32:33.089
- What were you
thinking, Janelle?


707
00:32:33.176 --> 00:32:34.568
- He needs my help.

708
00:32:34.655 --> 00:32:36.657
- Sometimes I need
your help too.


709
00:32:38.398 --> 00:32:41.140
[gentle music]

710
00:32:41.227 --> 00:32:44.665
You know how important
this deadline is to me.


711
00:32:44.753 --> 00:32:48.669
You know how important
becoming a writer is to me.


712
00:32:48.757 --> 00:32:51.063
I gave up a 15 year job
at the investment firm


713
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:51.847
to try for this.

714
00:32:51.934 --> 00:32:53.413
- I know.

715
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.112
- This weekend was
supposed to be about that.


716
00:32:56.199 --> 00:32:58.070
How am I supposed
to finish my book


717
00:32:58.157 --> 00:32:59.637
when I have to waste all my time

718
00:32:59.724 --> 00:33:01.900
taking care of some
backwards orphan


719
00:33:01.987 --> 00:33:04.424
who doesn't know a faucet
from an electric socket?


720
00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:05.991
I will take care of him.

721
00:33:06.078 --> 00:33:08.733
I promise you, you won't
even know we're here.


722
00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.082
I'll talk to the kids

723
00:33:10.169 --> 00:33:12.824
and we'll keep the
house quiet all weekend


724
00:33:12.911 --> 00:33:15.740
and Monday, I'll find
a family to take Finch.


725
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:16.349
- [Jackson] Mom.

726
00:33:17.873 --> 00:33:20.092
- Honey, how long have
you been standing there?


727
00:33:20.179 --> 00:33:22.181
- Not long, we came in
and get my walkie talkies


728
00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:23.835
to take to the tree house.

729
00:33:23.922 --> 00:33:24.967
- We?

730
00:33:25.054 --> 00:33:27.186
- Finch was here
too but he left.


731
00:33:27.273 --> 00:33:28.840
- You suppose he heard us?

732
00:33:28.927 --> 00:33:30.015
- Oh, he heard you.

733
00:33:31.016 --> 00:33:32.017
- I'd better go find him.

734
00:33:32.104 --> 00:33:33.366
- No, let me do it.

735
00:33:33.453 --> 00:33:34.803
- No, you go write.

736
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.282
He's my responsibility.

737
00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:38.807
- No, I shouldn't
have said what I said.


738
00:33:38.894 --> 00:33:39.808
I'll talk to him.

739
00:33:42.158 --> 00:33:45.030
- Mom, are you and
dad mad at each other?


740
00:33:45.117 --> 00:33:46.815
- No, honey.

741
00:33:46.902 --> 00:33:48.817
We just had a
little disagreement.


742
00:33:48.904 --> 00:33:50.122
- About Finch?

743
00:33:50.209 --> 00:33:51.036
- Yeah.

744
00:33:51.123 --> 00:33:51.863
- I like him.

745
00:33:52.995 --> 00:33:54.213
- Yeah, me too.

746
00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:05.790
- [Keith] Finch, wait up.

747
00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:08.010
- You don't need to concern
yourself with me, Mr. Brennan.


748
00:34:08.097 --> 00:34:10.926
- Look Finch, about
what I said back there.


749
00:34:11.013 --> 00:34:13.842
- I just came over for
dinner because I was invited.


750
00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.756
I'm going home.

751
00:34:15.844 --> 00:34:17.323
- Briar Rock is a
long way from here.


752
00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:18.150
- I'll get there.

753
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:20.805
- You know when you're hunting

754
00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:24.069
and you get focused
on the deer or rabbit


755
00:34:24.156 --> 00:34:26.071
and you don't see anything else?

756
00:34:26.158 --> 00:34:29.901
The woods around you
disappear, all sound stops,


757
00:34:29.988 --> 00:34:32.121
all you hear is your heartbeat,

758
00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:34.775
all you see is the slightest
movement of the prey?


759
00:34:38.475 --> 00:34:39.128
- Yeah.

760
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:45.656
- That's how it is for my
brain right now about my book.


761
00:34:45.743 --> 00:34:47.745
I wasn't thinking
about anyone else.


762
00:34:49.486 --> 00:34:51.923
I didn't mean any
of those dumb things


763
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.620
that I said back there.

764
00:34:53.707 --> 00:34:55.753
- I can take care of myself,

765
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.450
but no one listens to me.

766
00:34:57.537 --> 00:34:59.800
- I believe that you can
take care of yourself,


767
00:34:59.888 --> 00:35:00.758
but you don't have to.

768
00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:04.544
It's too late to go
anywhere tonight.


769
00:35:04.631 --> 00:35:06.155
Come on back to
the house with me.


770
00:35:08.592 --> 00:35:09.549
- And stay with you?

771
00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:11.551
- Not permanently.

772
00:35:12.988 --> 00:35:15.904
Just until you know what
you want to do next.


773
00:35:15.991 --> 00:35:18.994
Hey, you can read "David
Copperfield" while you're there.


774
00:35:20.865 --> 00:35:22.258
What do you say, Finch?

775
00:35:22.345 --> 00:35:23.563
Just for a little while.

776
00:35:26.653 --> 00:35:28.264
- Did God tell you
to come after me


777
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.312
or did you just decide
that on your own?


778
00:35:33.399 --> 00:35:34.923
- I'm not sure what you mean.

779
00:35:36.925 --> 00:35:39.318
- Whenever my gram had
a big decision to make,


780
00:35:39.405 --> 00:35:42.452
she would stop for a minute

781
00:35:42.539 --> 00:35:44.845
and she would get
real still and quiet


782
00:35:44.933 --> 00:35:47.718
and I knew that she was
praying to God in her head


783
00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:49.807
asking him what to do.

784
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.855
And then she would get
this big smile on her face


785
00:35:54.943 --> 00:35:57.162
and she would have her answer.

786
00:35:59.295 --> 00:36:00.992
- It worked that
fast every time?


787
00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:03.821
- She said that because
she's a simple lady


788
00:36:03.908 --> 00:36:06.476
God usually kept the
answers pretty simple too.


789
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:12.743
He often said yes
and no or we'll see.


790
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.138
That's how she kept
on the right path.


791
00:36:18.662 --> 00:36:20.707
Is that how you do
it, Mr. Brennan?


792
00:36:22.187 --> 00:36:23.536
- Yeah, I guess.

793
00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:29.020
If I'm honest, I
usually jump in first


794
00:36:29.107 --> 00:36:30.891
and then ask God for
a bail out later.


795
00:36:33.155 --> 00:36:34.634
- That's not how I
do it, Mr. Brennan.


796
00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:39.248
- All right, let's do
it your gran's way.


797
00:36:40.901 --> 00:36:42.991
On the count of three,
we'll ask together.


798
00:36:43.904 --> 00:36:47.082
One, two, three.

799
00:36:58.006 --> 00:36:58.789
We'll see?

800
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.140
- We'll see.

801
00:37:04.447 --> 00:37:05.535
- [Keith] Okay then.

802
00:37:05.622 --> 00:37:07.058
You know you should write down

803
00:37:07.145 --> 00:37:08.712
some of your memories
of your gran and pap.


804
00:37:08.799 --> 00:37:10.931
I'll bet you have some
interesting tales to tell.


805
00:37:11.019 --> 00:37:12.759
- [Finch] My gran once
took down a cougar


806
00:37:12.846 --> 00:37:13.760

00:46:06.379 --> 00:46:07.467
I'm really happy with it.

970
00:46:07.555 --> 00:46:08.860
- Did you finish the book?

971
00:46:08.947 --> 00:46:10.819
- Not yet, but I'm really close.

972
00:46:10.906 --> 00:46:12.385
- I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower.


973
00:46:12.472 --> 00:46:13.778
- And I have to go feed Lenny.

974
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.128
- What about you, Finch?

975
00:46:16.215 --> 00:46:17.565
Did you have a good time?

976
00:46:17.652 --> 00:46:18.783
- It was mighty fine.

977
00:46:19.784 --> 00:46:21.307
And I'm tuckered out.

978
00:46:21.394 --> 00:46:24.702
Right now, I think I'll go
read my book and go to bed.


979
00:46:24.789 --> 00:46:28.488
- Oh, Finch, I found this
empty journal in the library.


980
00:46:28.576 --> 00:46:29.838
Thought you might want to use it

981
00:46:29.925 --> 00:46:30.795
to write down some
of your memories


982
00:46:30.882 --> 00:46:32.928
from Briar Rock Mountain.

983
00:46:33.015 --> 00:46:33.755
- Thank you.

984
00:46:35.278 --> 00:46:37.497
I will, I'll start on it tonight

985
00:46:37.585 --> 00:46:38.977
right after I finish

986
00:46:39.064 --> 00:46:40.370
the next chapter of
"David Copperfield".


987
00:46:40.457 --> 00:46:42.938
- Oh, the book is on
the desk in the library.


988
00:46:45.027 --> 00:46:47.595
- Ruth said that Toby left
their house right after lunch.


989
00:46:47.682 --> 00:46:48.770
- Did she say where he went?

990
00:46:48.857 --> 00:46:50.336
- She thought he
was coming here.


991
00:46:50.423 --> 00:46:52.904
I called his phone, it
went directly to voicemail.


992
00:46:52.991 --> 00:46:54.689
You don't think
anything happened?


993
00:46:54.776 --> 00:46:58.214
- No, I'm sure
he'll be home soon.


994
00:46:58.301 --> 00:47:00.390
- Okay, I'll make
a few more calls


995
00:47:00.477 --> 00:47:01.783
and see if anyone has seen him.

996

[glass clinking]

[sizzling]

999
00:47:55.837 --> 00:47:57.839
- Did you find your book?

1000
00:47:57.926 --> 00:47:59.928
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what did you do?


1001
00:48:00.015 --> 00:48:01.930
- [Finch] I knocked something
over and I touched this.


1002
00:48:02.017 --> 00:48:03.192
- What did you touch?

1003
00:48:03.279 --> 00:48:04.802
- Just this.
- Get up, get up.


1004
00:48:06.499 --> 00:48:07.805
- Will it come back?

1005
00:48:07.892 --> 00:48:09.851
- You had no business
touching this.


1006
00:48:09.938 --> 00:48:11.330
- [Finch] I just wanted
to read your book.


1007
00:48:11.417 --> 00:48:12.680
- And now it's gone.

1008
00:48:14.029 --> 00:48:15.900
- I didn't mean to.
- Go.


1009
00:48:15.987 --> 00:48:17.467
- I'm sorry.
- Go!


1010
00:48:21.471 --> 00:48:22.559
- Finch?

1011
00:48:22.646 --> 00:48:24.430
Keith, what was that all about?

1012
00:48:24.517 --> 00:48:26.389
- He spilled water
all over the computer.


1013
00:48:26.476 --> 00:48:27.433
It's fried.

1014
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.652
I lost everything.

1015
00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:30.523
- Do you have a backup?

1016
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.047
- It has a backup drive in it.

1017
00:48:32.134 --> 00:48:33.352
It may still work.

1018
00:48:33.439 --> 00:48:34.397
- Call Uncle Jerry.

1019
00:48:34.484 --> 00:48:35.528
He works in computers.

1020
00:48:35.615 --> 00:48:36.878
- Yeah, he'll know what to do.

1021
00:48:36.965 --> 00:48:39.184
- You call him, 
I'll clean up.

1022
00:48:39.271 --> 00:48:40.359
- And where have you been?

1023
00:48:40.446 --> 00:48:41.926
Your mother and I were worried.

1024
00:48:42.013 --> 00:48:43.449
- I went over to Steve's.

1025
00:48:43.536 --> 00:48:44.624
I forgot to call.

1026
00:48:44.712 --> 00:48:45.582
Sorry.

1027
00:48:45.669 --> 00:48:46.975
- When will you realize

1028
00:48:47.062 --> 00:48:49.760
that sorry doesn't
magically fix everything?


1029
00:48:49.847 --> 00:48:52.415
You should have called us
and told us where you were.


1030
00:48:52.502 --> 00:48:54.112
- I just forgot.

1031
00:48:54.199 --> 00:48:55.374
- Well, you won't forget this.

1032
00:48:55.461 --> 00:48:57.072
You're grounded.

1033
00:48:57.159 --> 00:48:59.074
One week, you're not leaving
this house except for school.


1034
00:48:59.161 --> 00:49:00.815
Got it?

1035
00:49:00.902 --> 00:49:02.599
- I got it.

1036
00:49:17.614 --> 00:49:19.659
You know what this
means, don't you?


1037
00:49:19.747 --> 00:49:20.922
- I didn't mean to.

1038
00:49:21.009 --> 00:49:21.923
- If he loses that book,

1039
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.272
he'll be finished as a writer.

1040
00:49:23.359 --> 00:49:25.013
- Finished?

1041
00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.232
- You should have stayed on
that mountain where you belong.


1042
00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:28.407
- Listen, I'm really sorry.

1043
00:49:28.494 --> 00:49:29.844
I didn't know-

1044
00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:31.236
- Dad never should have
let you in this house.


1045
00:49:31.323 --> 00:49:33.630
He didn't want to,
but mom made him.


1046
00:49:33.717 --> 00:49:35.763
- He asked me to stay.

1047
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:37.852
- What, you think
you wanted you here?


1048
00:49:37.939 --> 00:49:39.157
The only reason he's
letting you stay


1049
00:49:39.244 --> 00:49:40.811
is because mom promised
to get rid of you


1050
00:49:40.898 --> 00:49:42.987
first thing Monday morning.

1051
00:49:43.074 --> 00:49:46.034
You are not a part of this
family and you never will be.


1052
00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:52.823
[dramatic music]

1053
00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:08.926
- I need to get in.

[crying]
[sad music]


1055

1056
00:51:32.967 --> 00:51:34.838
Finch!

1057
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:38.189
Finch!

1058
00:51:41.976 --> 00:51:43.803
Did you stay out here all night?

1059
00:51:43.891 --> 00:51:44.892
What's this?

1060
00:51:47.372 --> 00:51:49.113
- I did what you said.

1061
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.855
I wrote down memories
of gran and pap


1062
00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.291
so I'll always have them.

1063
00:51:54.379 --> 00:51:55.859
- Finch, this is really good.

1064
00:51:57.774 --> 00:51:59.471
You're an excellent writer.

1065
00:52:00.864 --> 00:52:02.474
- You think so?

1066
00:52:02.561 --> 00:52:03.475
- Yeah, I do.

1067
00:52:04.999 --> 00:52:07.871
- But we better get you
inside, warm you up.


1068
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.481
Janelle has some
breakfast ready.


1069
00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.006
- I can't go back.

1070
00:52:13.703 --> 00:52:14.965
I've caused too much trouble.

1071
00:52:18.142 --> 00:52:20.405
- Well, you can't stay here.

1072
00:52:20.492 --> 00:52:22.059
We'll figure it out.

1073
00:52:22.146 --> 00:52:23.756
It might take us a little
longer than expected,


1074
00:52:23.843 --> 00:52:25.106
but we'll find you a home.

1075
00:52:36.552 --> 00:52:38.684
- [Toby] I told you to
stay out of my room.


1076
00:52:38.771 --> 00:52:39.729
- [Jackson] I
wasn't in your room.


1077
00:52:39.816 --> 00:52:41.252
- Boys.

1078
00:52:41.339 --> 00:52:42.297
- [Toby] Then why is
my hoodie on your bed?


1079
00:52:42.384 --> 00:52:43.907
- [Jackson] I don't know.

1080
00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.822
- Mom, can I go to Sophie's?

1081
00:52:45.909 --> 00:52:46.649
- Have you finished
sweeping the porch?


1082
00:52:46.736 --> 00:52:47.780
- [Toby] Is that my hat?

1083
00:52:47.867 --> 00:52:49.869
- [Jackson] Get out of my room.

1084
00:52:49.957 --> 00:52:51.436
- Not yet, I'll do it after.

1085
00:52:51.523 --> 00:52:52.872
- You know the rules.

1086
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.873
- [Toby] Give them to me.

1087
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:55.353
- Boys, keep it down.

1088
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.572
Not until your chores are done.

1089
00:52:56.659 --> 00:52:58.226
- It'll be too late then.

1090
00:52:58.313 --> 00:52:59.836
- Mom, Toby hit me.

1091
00:52:59.923 --> 00:53:01.751
- I did not, you're such a baby.

1092
00:53:01.838 --> 00:53:02.534
- Mom please.

1093
00:53:02.621 --> 00:53:03.753
- Enough!

1094
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.363
Your dad is writing.

1095
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:07.800
Jack, go outside and play.

1096
00:53:07.887 --> 00:53:09.802
Toby, go into Jack's room,

1097
00:53:09.889 --> 00:53:11.804
get your things out of there
and apologize for hitting him.


1098
00:53:11.891 --> 00:53:13.458
Lisa, chores first.

1099
00:53:13.545 --> 00:53:14.416
- Okay.

1100
00:53:14.503 --> 00:53:15.634
- I didn't touch him.

1101
00:53:15.721 --> 00:53:17.680
- I never get to go anywhere.

1102
00:53:17.767 --> 00:53:19.856
[scoffs]

1103
00:53:22.119 --> 00:53:23.903
- What you doing?

1104
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:25.035
- Recollecting.

1105
00:53:25.122 --> 00:53:26.645
- What's that mean?

1106
00:53:26.732 --> 00:53:28.038
- It means I'm writing down

1107
00:53:28.125 --> 00:53:29.822
things that happened
in the past.


1108
00:53:29.909 --> 00:53:31.259
- Like stories?

1109
00:53:31.346 --> 00:53:32.521
- Memories.

1110
00:53:32.608 --> 00:53:33.870
- Will you tell me one?

1111
00:53:33.957 --> 00:53:34.392
- Sure.

1112
00:53:35.872 --> 00:53:38.266
- Lisa, Finch is
gonna tell me a story.


1113
00:53:38.353 --> 00:53:39.745
You want to hear it?

1114
00:53:39.832 --> 00:53:40.877
- Why not?

1115
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.012
- Well, this one is about

1116
00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:48.102
when my gran was laid up in bed

1117
00:53:48.189 --> 00:53:49.842
and pap had to make the lye soap

1118
00:53:49.929 --> 00:53:51.279
by himself for the first time.

1119
00:53:54.325 --> 00:53:55.892
- Will you look at that?

1120
00:53:55.979 --> 00:53:58.590
- Yeah, they've been at
it for almost an hour now.


1121
00:53:58.677 --> 00:53:59.983
- No arguing and fighting.

1122
00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.724
- I know, I can't
believe it either.


1123
00:54:03.247 --> 00:54:05.249
I just wish Toby was
out there with them.


1124
00:54:06.337 --> 00:54:07.991
- What about us?

1125
00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.732
Why aren't we out
there with them?


1126
00:54:09.819 --> 00:54:10.863
- Good question.

1127
00:54:11.995 --> 00:54:13.562
[laughing]

1128
00:54:13.649 --> 00:54:15.694
I can't believe that
really happened.


1129
00:54:15.781 --> 00:54:17.740
- Come on Finch, tell
them about the lye soap.


1130
00:54:17.827 --> 00:54:19.089
That one's really funny.

1131
00:54:19.176 --> 00:54:20.612
- Finch might need
to take a break.


1132
00:54:20.699 --> 00:54:22.092
He's been at it for a while now.

1133
00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:24.181
- I'm so glad you're
writing these down.


1134
00:54:24.268 --> 00:54:26.096
These are priceless memories.

1135
00:54:26.183 --> 00:54:28.359
- Well, my pap was
the storyteller.


1136
00:54:28.446 --> 00:54:29.969
After dinner, we
would sit on the porch


1137
00:54:30.057 --> 00:54:33.712
and he would weave gran
and I the wildest tales


1138
00:54:33.799 --> 00:54:36.411
and we would laugh until
we had tears in our eyes.


1139
00:54:36.498 --> 00:54:38.413
And he always swore
they were all true,


1140
00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.067
but after he passed,

1141
00:54:40.154 --> 00:54:41.894
gran told me that he
would just make them up


1142
00:54:41.981 --> 00:54:43.070
while he was doing his chores.

1143
00:54:44.636 --> 00:54:46.856
- You should write your
pap's stories down too.


1144
00:54:46.943 --> 00:54:49.467
- You can make a whole
book out of them.


1145
00:54:49.554 --> 00:54:51.034
- I think he would
have liked that.


1146
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:52.818
- [Janelle] I'm sure
he'd be so proud


1147
00:54:52.905 --> 00:54:55.430
to know his stories are
still making people happy.


1148
00:54:55.517 --> 00:54:57.736
- Looks like you're gonna
need some more journals


1149
00:54:57.823 --> 00:54:59.390
or maybe a laptop computer.

1150
00:54:59.477 --> 00:55:00.826
- No.

1151
00:55:00.913 --> 00:55:02.872
Thank you, I will
stick to my pencils.


1152
00:55:02.959 --> 00:55:05.222
[laughing]

1153
00:55:06.876 --> 00:55:08.921
- Yes, that is correct.

1154
00:55:13.187 --> 00:55:13.970
Uh huh.

1155
00:55:16.929 --> 00:55:19.976
Yes, well, Marguerite.

1156
00:55:20.063 --> 00:55:21.456
Hey, let me call you back.

1157
00:55:22.587 --> 00:55:24.198
What are you doing here?

1158
00:55:24.285 --> 00:55:27.114
- I know how eager you are to
find a placement for Finch.


1159
00:55:27.201 --> 00:55:31.161
- Well, we were, but things
went really well this weekend.


1160
00:55:31.248 --> 00:55:33.120
Keith and I talked
about it last night


1161
00:55:33.207 --> 00:55:34.425
and if you can't find a family-

1162
00:55:34.512 --> 00:55:35.774
- Oh but I already have,

1163
00:55:35.861 --> 00:55:37.298
that's what I came
by to tell you.


1164
00:55:37.385 --> 00:55:39.822
Finch's birth mother
contacted CPS.


1165
00:55:39.909 --> 00:55:41.954
- His birth mother?

1166
00:55:42.041 --> 00:55:43.130
But we don't know who she is?

1167
00:55:43.217 --> 00:55:44.653
- We do now.

1168
00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.916
She came by with two
attorneys and a full affidavit


1169
00:55:47.003 --> 00:55:48.657
explaining everything
that happened


1170
00:55:48.744 --> 00:55:50.659
down to the smallest detail.

1171
00:55:50.746 --> 00:55:52.922
She's even consented
to a blood test.


1172
00:55:53.009 --> 00:55:54.750
It's definitely her.

1173
00:55:54.837 --> 00:55:57.666
And she wants full custody.

1174
00:55:57.753 --> 00:55:59.798
So you and Keith
are off the hook.


1175
00:55:59.885 --> 00:56:01.800
- Why is she showing up now?

1176
00:56:01.887 --> 00:56:04.803
Where has she been
for the last 16 years?


1177
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:06.805
- I thought you'd
be happy about this.


1178
00:56:06.892 --> 00:56:09.286
- She abandoned
him with strangers


1179
00:56:09.373 --> 00:56:12.289
and didn't contact
him for 16 years.


1180
00:56:12.376 --> 00:56:15.292
Excuse me for questioning
her character.


1181
00:56:15.379 --> 00:56:16.859
- Oh, Janelle.

1182
00:56:16.946 --> 00:56:19.905
Please tell me, you're not
gonna try and fight this.


1183
00:56:19.992 --> 00:56:21.516
- And what happens if we do?

1184
00:56:23.735 --> 00:56:25.781
- The judge would
hear both parties


1185
00:56:25.868 --> 00:56:27.870
and make a determination.

1186
00:56:27.957 --> 00:56:29.915
But I have to warn you, Janelle,

1187
00:56:30.002 --> 00:56:34.050
the law heavily favors the birth
mother in these situations.


1188
00:56:34.137 --> 00:56:35.225
- Well, I don't.

1189
00:56:35.312 --> 00:56:36.922
- What happened?

1190
00:56:37.009 --> 00:56:39.011
I thought that you wanted to
find a permanent home for him.


1191
00:56:39.098 --> 00:56:40.404
- I do.

1192
00:56:40.491 --> 00:56:42.580
I just want to make
sure it's the right one.


1193
00:56:44.278 --> 00:56:45.366
[sighs]

1194
00:56:54.026 --> 00:56:56.768
- Okay, so what
do we tell Finch?


1195
00:56:56.855 --> 00:56:58.248
- Nothing for now.

1196
00:56:58.335 --> 00:57:00.816
Anything could happen
before the judge's ruling?


1197
00:57:00.903 --> 00:57:03.993
I mean she could decide
to disappear again.


1198
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.690
- It's better not
to get his hopes up


1199
00:57:05.777 --> 00:57:07.953
until we know
something for certain.


1200
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.260
Will the judge let him stay
with us until the hearing?


1201
00:57:10.347 --> 00:57:12.044
- Do you want him to?

1202
00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:13.611
It could take weeks.

1203
00:57:13.698 --> 00:57:15.091
- He's already here.

1204
00:57:15.178 --> 00:57:16.875
We don't want to
move him around again


1205
00:57:16.962 --> 00:57:18.964
and it's only for
a little while.


1206
00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:24.535
- Are we crazy for
getting mixed up in this?


1207
00:57:24.622 --> 00:57:26.885
- It's a little late
for that, isn't it?


1208
00:57:26.972 --> 00:57:28.757
Could you walk
away from this now?


1209
00:57:28.844 --> 00:57:32.369
- No.

1210
00:57:32.456 --> 00:57:35.546
- Could you?

1211
00:57:35.633 --> 00:57:36.939
- No.

1212
00:57:37.026 --> 00:57:38.680
[soft music]

1213
00:57:39.855 --> 00:57:41.248
- Thank you.

1214
00:57:41.335 --> 00:57:42.118
- For what?

1215
00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:47.036
- For just being you.

1216
00:57:51.432 --> 00:57:52.824
- Did you pack my jello?

1217
00:57:52.911 --> 00:57:54.696
- [Janelle] Strawberry,
it's in your bag.


1218
00:57:54.783 --> 00:57:55.566
- Yes!

1219
00:57:58.569 --> 00:58:00.919
- I'm going to Dina's after
school to do homework.


1220
00:58:01.006 --> 00:58:01.964
- Will her mom be home?

1221
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:03.095
- [Lisa] Uh huh.

1222
00:58:04.532 --> 00:58:06.316
- Drake's big
brother will be home.


1223
00:58:06.403 --> 00:58:08.362
- Nice try but we
talked about this,


1224
00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:10.451
straight home from school
to do your homework.


1225
00:58:10.538 --> 00:58:12.801
You can play "Hunter's Watch"
with Drake next Saturday.


1226
00:58:12.888 --> 00:58:14.324
- Lisa gets to go.

1227
00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:15.978
- Sorry, that's
how it is for now.


1228
00:58:18.937 --> 00:58:19.808
- Looking sharp.

1229
00:58:21.636 --> 00:58:22.941
- First day of school
for Finch, mom,


1230
00:58:23.028 --> 00:58:23.855
take a picture.

1231
00:58:23.942 --> 00:58:25.335
- We're gonna be late.

1232
00:58:25.422 --> 00:58:27.642
- Nope, Jack's right,
it's tradition.


1233
00:58:27.729 --> 00:58:29.818
We always take a picture
of the first day of school.


1234
00:58:29.905 --> 00:58:30.993
- It's not my first
day of school.


1235
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.168
I'll be in the car.

1236
00:58:32.255 --> 00:58:33.604
- Toby.

1237
00:58:33.691 --> 00:58:36.781
Okay, come on,
everybody, move in close.


1238
00:58:39.828 --> 00:58:41.133
Got it.

1239
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.744
- Get in the car,
it's time to go.


1240
00:58:48.706 --> 00:58:49.794
Are you ready for this?

1241
00:58:49.881 --> 00:58:51.970
- I think so.

1242
00:58:52.057 --> 00:58:54.059
I don't really know
what it will be like.


1243
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:57.149
- Just be yourself.

1244
00:58:57.236 --> 00:58:58.803
Be friendly.

1245
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:00.849
Don't make too many A's
on your first day though.


1246
00:59:00.936 --> 00:59:03.330
Lisa is accustomed to being
the smartest one in the family.


1247
00:59:03.417 --> 00:59:04.896
- Oh stop.

1248
00:59:04.983 --> 00:59:06.768
Don't be afraid to ask questions

1249
00:59:06.855 --> 00:59:10.380
and remember Toby will be there
to help you find everything.


1250
00:59:10.467 --> 00:59:11.555
- I'll be fine.

1251
00:59:11.642 --> 00:59:12.817
Thank you.

1252
00:59:12.904 --> 00:59:14.341
- Well, get in the car then.

1253
00:59:14.428 --> 00:59:15.864
We can't be late
for your first day.


1254
00:59:17.039 --> 00:59:19.563
[jaunty music]

1255
00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:33.969
- I am sorry I'm late, youngins,

1256
00:59:34.056 --> 00:59:36.711
but I lost my glasses
in the teacher's lounge.


1257
00:59:36.798 --> 00:59:41.455
But fear not, I have another
pair here in my bag somewhere.


1258
00:59:41.542 --> 00:59:43.935
Oh here they are,
a bit dirty but,


1259
00:59:44.022 --> 00:59:45.633
we'll clean 'em up.

1260

Oh, it looks like the ground
flew up there for a minute.

Oh, I hope you did
your reading for today


1262
00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:55.033
because I'm gonna be passing
out a quiz on chapter 46.

Oh ooh, oh, we have a unique
new student with us today.

Join me in welcoming,
Mr. French Wagemaker.

French, why don't you
come up and join us


1268
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:13.661
so we all know who you are?

might be a little slow.

up to the front please?


1271
01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.410
- Me?

1272
01:00:23.497 --> 01:00:25.890
- Yes, come to the front please.

Everybody, this is
French Wagemaker.

He's never been to a
proper school before

01:00:34.421 --> 01:00:35.987
on account of he
grew up on a mountain

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.229
[Laughter]
Sit.


1285
01:01:01.926 --> 01:01:04.842
As soon as we read the quote
of the day up on the board,


1286
01:01:04.929 --> 01:01:07.541
we'll jump right into that quiz.

1287
01:01:07.628 --> 01:01:08.455
All righty then.

1288
01:01:10.021 --> 01:01:13.155
Oh since this is French's
very first day with us,


1289
01:01:13.242 --> 01:01:15.940
why don't we have him
read the quote of the day


1290
01:01:16.027 --> 01:01:18.900
and give us his opinion?

1291
01:01:18.987 --> 01:01:23.078
[Shouting] French, read aloud
the quote for us, please.


1292
01:01:24.993 --> 01:01:27.952
[students laughing]

1293
01:01:30.868 --> 01:01:32.261
Oh boy.

1294
01:01:32.348 --> 01:01:35.394
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to embarrass you, honey.


1295
01:01:35.482 --> 01:01:37.875
They told me you could read.

1296
01:01:37.962 --> 01:01:39.747
[laughing]

1297
01:01:39.834 --> 01:01:41.879
- No school should ever
try to serve meatloaf.


1298
01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:44.752
- I swear, Miss Davenport's
trying to kill us.


1299
01:01:44.839 --> 01:01:47.276
- So where is he?

1300
01:01:47.363 --> 01:01:49.147
- He went to go
find the bathroom.


1301
01:01:49.234 --> 01:01:51.933
- Yeah, but that
was 20 minutes ago.


1302
01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.064
- This is ridiculous.

1303
01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:54.979
We have to babysit him all day.

1304
01:01:55.066 --> 01:01:57.286
- I'm not babysitting anyone.

1305
01:01:57.373 --> 01:01:58.330
- Thanks for the help.

1306
01:01:58.417 --> 01:02:00.942
- Hey, he seems like a nice guy.

1307
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:02.987
Maybe a little clueless.

1308
01:02:03.074 --> 01:02:04.423
- A little brainless, too.

1309
01:02:06.338 --> 01:02:09.080
- Hey, are you
really a hillbilly?


1310
01:02:09.167 --> 01:02:11.082
- I don't really
know what that is.


1311
01:02:11.169 --> 01:02:12.780
- Don't be rude.
- What?


1312
01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:13.781
- How long did
you live up there?


1313
01:02:13.868 --> 01:02:14.695
- On the mountain?

1314
01:02:14.782 --> 01:02:16.218
I was born there.

1315
01:02:16.305 --> 01:02:17.872
- So was their an entire
village of mountain people


1316
01:02:17.959 --> 01:02:18.786
or just you?

1317
01:02:18.873 --> 01:02:20.614
- Just me and my gran.

1318
01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:22.529
- Did you grow up wearing
nothing but a loincloth


1319
01:02:22.616 --> 01:02:23.442
like Tarzan?

1320
01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:24.443
- I didn't-

1321
01:02:24.531 --> 01:02:26.010
- You didn't have a loincloth?

1322
01:02:26.097 --> 01:02:28.230
- Cut it out, guys.

1323
01:02:28.317 --> 01:02:30.798
- What, does he
have a fan club now?


1324
01:02:30.885 --> 01:02:32.364
- People are just curious.

1325
01:02:32.451 --> 01:02:34.889
- He grew up in the
woods, big deal.


1326
01:02:34.976 --> 01:02:38.196
- Uh oh, someone sounds
a little jealous.


1327
01:02:38.283 --> 01:02:39.894
- Don't start with me, man.

1328
01:02:39.981 --> 01:02:42.070
- You don't know who
Tarzan is, do you?


1329
01:02:42.157 --> 01:02:43.593
- No.

1330
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.814
- So have you ever been
on the internet before?


1331
01:02:46.901 --> 01:02:48.642
- I have a fishing net.

1332
01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:50.252
My pap and I made it.

1333
01:02:50.339 --> 01:02:51.470
- Pap?

1334
01:02:51.558 --> 01:02:52.515
He's got a pap.

1335
01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.690
- Well, actually-

1336
01:02:53.777 --> 01:02:55.083
- That is so hillbilly.

1337
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:57.564
- So did you fish
and hunt for food?


1338
01:02:57.651 --> 01:02:58.913
- That's cool.

1339
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.871
I mean, it's crazy,
but it's cool.


1340
01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:01.916
- How is that cool?

1341
01:03:02.003 --> 01:03:03.613
- Well, maybe not to you, Caleb,

1342
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.963
but you wouldn't last more
than five minutes in the wild.


1343
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:08.052
- Shut up.
- That's so true, though.


1344
01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:09.271
- Thanks for talking with me.

1345
01:03:09.358 --> 01:03:10.925
Nice to meet you all.

1346
01:03:20.064 --> 01:03:21.892
- Hurry up, you're
gonna make us late.


1347
01:03:24.808 --> 01:03:26.549
- What do you have on your arm?

1348
01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.638
- It's my locker combination.

1349
01:03:28.725 --> 01:03:30.684
A girl wrote it on there for me.

1350
01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:32.903
- That's not a
locker combination.


1351
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.730
- Hurry up and get changed.

1352
01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:34.818
We have PE next.

1353
01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.996
See what I mean, babysitting.

1354
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.651
He's fine.

1355
01:03:41.738 --> 01:03:42.521
- Hold up.

1356
01:03:43.697 --> 01:03:44.915
- You don't need to do that.

1357
01:03:48.876 --> 01:03:49.877
- Bring your gym clothes.

1358
01:03:49.964 --> 01:03:51.705
We are running today.

1359
01:03:53.054 --> 01:03:54.446
Are you fast?

1360
01:03:54.533 --> 01:03:55.883
- I think so.

1361
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:58.842
My gran and I never
really raced much.


1362
01:03:58.929 --> 01:04:01.105
- Well, Toby's been the
fastest kid in our class


1363
01:04:01.192 --> 01:04:02.672
since fifth grade.

1364
01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:04.282
It's about time
somebody beat him.


1365
01:04:05.806 --> 01:04:07.242
- What makes you
think he can beat me?


1366
01:04:07.329 --> 01:04:08.983
- I don't know.

1367
01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:11.202
This guy has been running around
a mountain his whole life.


1368
01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:13.378
We spent six hours
playing "Hunter's Watch"


1369
01:04:13.465 --> 01:04:15.990
and eating potato
chips last Saturday.


1370
01:04:16.077 --> 01:04:17.426
I'd bet money on him.

1371
01:04:19.471 --> 01:04:20.908
- That's everyone,
Coach Winklevoss.


1372
01:04:20.995 --> 01:04:23.562
- All right, runners.

1373
01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:24.955
Let's go.

1374
01:04:25.042 --> 01:04:26.783
Let's get those
legs stretched out.


1375
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:28.785
[grumbling]

1376
01:04:28.872 --> 01:04:31.309
And I don't want to
hear any complaining.


1377
01:04:31.396 --> 01:04:33.398
Today is a beautiful
day for running.


1378
01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:49.806
Okay, how do we feel back there?

1379
01:04:49.893 --> 01:04:51.373
[grumbling]

1380
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.984
Since it's a new month,
we have a new challenge.


1381
01:04:54.071 --> 01:04:57.118
The student who has the
fastest cumulative time


1382
01:04:57.205 --> 01:04:58.946
in the 100 meter dash

1383
01:04:59.033 --> 01:05:02.906
will win four tickets
to the Cineplex Theater.


1384
01:05:02.993 --> 01:05:04.778
[Grumbling]
[Kid] Just four?


1385
01:05:04.865 --> 01:05:06.910
What, you don't like movies?

1386
01:05:06.997 --> 01:05:09.217
- You may as well
hand them to Toby now.


1387
01:05:09.304 --> 01:05:11.088
Save us all a lot
of embarrassment.


1388
01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:12.524
[Girl] Yeah, it'd save time.

1389
01:05:12.611 --> 01:05:14.265
- Oh, come on now.

1390
01:05:14.352 --> 01:05:16.006
That's the wrong attitude.

1391
01:05:16.093 --> 01:05:17.051
You gotta work for it.

1392
01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:20.184
Strive to be better every day.

1393
01:05:21.446 --> 01:05:22.273
[whistle blowing]

1394
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.187
Line 'em up, people.

1395
01:05:23.274 --> 01:05:24.972
First group of five.

1396
01:05:25.059 --> 01:05:27.714
[upbeat music]

1397
01:05:39.813 --> 01:05:40.552
- On your marks,

1398
01:05:41.858 --> 01:05:43.077
get set,
[dramatic music]


1399
01:05:43.164 --> 01:05:43.991
go.

1400
01:05:44.078 --> 01:05:46.863
[kids cheering]

1401
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:48.822
- You can do it, Finch.

1402
01:05:51.433 --> 01:05:53.783
- Come on Toby,
you can take him.


1403
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:56.307
[upbeat music]

1404
01:05:56.394 --> 01:06:00.224
[crowd shouts disapprovingly]

1405
01:06:04.011 --> 01:06:05.099
- [Girl] Are you okay?

1406
01:06:05.186 --> 01:06:06.143
- Easy, easy.

1407
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.623
- [Girl] Oh my gosh, okay, okay.

1408
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.103
It's gonna be okay.
- Let's lift him up.


1409
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:13.324
Okay, stand, there you
go, up, easy, okay.


1410
01:06:13.411 --> 01:06:14.673
Here we go.

1411
01:06:14.761 --> 01:06:15.674
Here we go.

1412
01:06:17.633 --> 01:06:19.069
- What kind of cheap
shot was that, dude?


1413
01:06:19.156 --> 01:06:19.940
- We just bumped.

1414
01:06:20.027 --> 01:06:21.028
It happens.

1415
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:23.334
- Don't worry, kids,

1416
01:06:23.421 --> 01:06:24.771
I think he'll be okay.

1417
01:06:24.858 --> 01:06:25.772
- What?

1418
01:06:25.859 --> 01:06:26.773
- [Girl] What was that?

1419
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.469
- I won fair and square.

1420
01:06:27.556 --> 01:06:28.383
- Jerk move.

1421
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:29.471
- It was an accident.

1422
01:06:31.778 --> 01:06:33.475
What's their problem?

1423
01:06:33.562 --> 01:06:34.345
Where are you going?

1424
01:06:34.432 --> 01:06:35.825
- I'm going to make sure

1425
01:06:35.912 --> 01:06:37.914
he knows where the
bathroom is this time.


1426
01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:40.090
Try not to kick anyone
else while I'm gone.


1427
01:06:48.403 --> 01:06:51.145
- Look at you,
hitting the books.


1428
01:06:51.232 --> 01:06:52.886
- Not like I have a choice.

1429
01:06:52.973 --> 01:06:54.322
I'm grounded, remember?

1430
01:06:56.803 --> 01:06:57.586
- I do.

1431
01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:06.856
You know, I was thinking,

1432
01:07:06.943 --> 01:07:10.077
next weekend, maybe
we should go camping.


1433
01:07:10.164 --> 01:07:12.819
Get some fresh air,
clear our heads a bit.


1434
01:07:13.907 --> 01:07:14.864
- Really?

1435
01:07:14.951 --> 01:07:17.084
- Yeah, it's been a long time.

1436
01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:19.390
I could finally teach
you how to fish.


1437
01:07:19.477 --> 01:07:22.002
- Yeah, okay.

1438
01:07:22.089 --> 01:07:24.482
- My rods are too
big for Jack, though.


1439
01:07:24.569 --> 01:07:26.876
We'll have to stop and pick
up a smaller one for him.


1440
01:07:27.834 --> 01:07:29.357
- Jack?

1441
01:07:29.444 --> 01:07:30.967
- Though Finch says he
makes his own fishing rods


1442

how to do that.

I told Drake I'd
meet him on Saturday.

I'm getting tired
of your attitude.

You are part of a family

1453
01:07:49.203 --> 01:07:50.552
and being part of a family

1454
01:07:50.639 --> 01:07:53.207
means you take time and
invest in your family.

finish in my room.

hiding in your room.

You need to be down here

make a stronger effort

fit the bill either.

We've had this plan for awhile.

- But why so fast?

1497
01:09:48.191 --> 01:09:51.020
She hasn't shown any interest
in him since he was born


1498
01:09:51.107 --> 01:09:53.805
and now all of a sudden she
can't live a day without him.


1499
01:09:53.892 --> 01:09:55.807
- Maybe she didn't
know where he was.

- He was right where
she abandoned him.

her life in a good place

here with two attorneys.

Who hires two attorneys for
a family custody hearing?

- I can't say anything more.

1508
01:10:14.565 --> 01:10:16.828
- She's either ridiculously rich

1509
01:10:16.915 --> 01:10:20.136
or someone else is helping
her out, a family member.

talk to you about this.

Did she look like she had money?

- No.

1518
01:10:34.977 --> 01:10:38.850
- Then how can she hire
a team of attorneys?

When she came into your office,

was she calm and composed
or fidgety and nervous?

01:16:08.919 --> 01:16:12.183
and I promised Jack I'd make
him a table for the tree house.


1600
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:14.142
- I know it's a
lot to think about.


1601
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:16.927
- You don't have to
decide anything right now.


1602
01:16:17.014 --> 01:16:19.103
You can take your time
and think about it.


1603
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:23.369
- Yeah.

1604
01:16:27.938 --> 01:16:30.506
Can I be alone for a minute?

1605
01:16:30.593 --> 01:16:32.378
- Yes, of course.

1606
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.487
So it turns out the
Whittaker's weren't squatters.


1607
01:16:54.574 --> 01:16:56.967
They owned the 125 acres of land

1608
01:16:57.054 --> 01:16:58.969
on top of Briar Rock Mountain.

1609
01:16:59.056 --> 01:17:01.711
Jeremiah Whitaker
inherited it in 1952


1610
01:17:01.798 --> 01:17:04.148
and now it belongs to Finch,

1611
01:17:04.235 --> 01:17:07.064
well to his guardian
anyway, until he turns 18.


1612
01:17:07.151 --> 01:17:08.849
- Oh, that's great.

1613
01:17:08.936 --> 01:17:10.807
That much land must be worth
a couple hundred thousand


1614
01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:11.765
in today's money.

1615
01:17:11.852 --> 01:17:13.897
- Try 2.5 million.

1616
01:17:13.984 --> 01:17:15.595
- Million?

1617
01:17:15.682 --> 01:17:17.074
- That's how much Alpha Gas
offered the Whittakers for it


1618
01:17:17.161 --> 01:17:18.598
before they died.

1619
01:17:18.685 --> 01:17:20.774
Apparently that land
is prime for fracking.


1620
01:17:20.861 --> 01:17:23.777
- Finch is worth $2.5 million?

1621
01:17:23.864 --> 01:17:27.389
- No, his guardian
is until he turns 18.


1622
01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.738
And guess who knows about it?

1623
01:17:28.825 --> 01:17:29.609
- No.

1624
01:17:29.696 --> 01:17:30.958
- Enter his mother,

1625
01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:33.482
armed to the teeth
with expensive lawyers.


1626
01:17:33.569 --> 01:17:34.918
- Poor Finch.

1627
01:17:35.005 --> 01:17:36.572
- Judge Raymond is
gonna get an earful


1628
01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:37.965
about this at the hearing.

1629
01:17:38.052 --> 01:17:39.923
- You can't say
anything about this.


1630
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:41.577
- I most certainly can.

1631
01:17:41.664 --> 01:17:43.274
- No, you can't.

1632
01:17:43.361 --> 01:17:44.537
Think about Finch.

1633
01:17:44.624 --> 01:17:46.103
What would it do to him?

1634
01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:47.975
His mother comes
back into his life


1635
01:17:48.062 --> 01:17:51.152
and you're going to tell him
she's only here for his money?


1636
01:17:51.239 --> 01:17:52.849
And what if she isn't?

1637
01:17:52.936 --> 01:17:54.851
- Why else would she
suddenly show up?


1638
01:17:54.938 --> 01:17:56.810
- We don't really
know why she's back.


1639
01:17:56.897 --> 01:17:58.464
She may really want
to be with him.


1640
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:01.554
We can't interfere
in their relationship


1641
01:18:01.641 --> 01:18:02.990
based solely on a hunch.

1642
01:18:03.077 --> 01:18:05.645
- Keith, I don't
want her to hurt him.


1643
01:18:05.732 --> 01:18:08.125
- We may not be
able to stop that.


1644
01:18:08.212 --> 01:18:10.650
- Well I can't just stand
by and let it happen.


1645
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:12.956
What is that?

1646
01:18:13.043 --> 01:18:13.957
What are you looking at?

1647
01:18:14.044 --> 01:18:15.393
- Toby's grades.

1648
01:18:15.481 --> 01:18:17.134
He's failing three classes.

1649
01:18:19.746 --> 01:18:23.489
- He's pulling away from
everything, school, us.


1650
01:18:23.576 --> 01:18:24.838
- It's my fault.

1651
01:18:24.925 --> 01:18:25.969
He thinks I'm
disappointed in him.


1652
01:18:26.056 --> 01:18:27.362
- But that's not true.

1653
01:18:27.449 --> 01:18:29.233
- I know, but I
haven't done enough


1654
01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.496
to convince him otherwise.

1655
01:18:32.193 --> 01:18:35.370
- Sometimes it's hard for
him to let people love him.


1656
01:18:35.457 --> 01:18:37.851
He's always been so
critical of himself.


1657
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.115
He's like his father that way.

1658
01:18:44.379 --> 01:18:45.336
You'll talk to him?

1659
01:18:47.469 --> 01:18:48.252
- Yeah.

1660
01:18:51.908 --> 01:18:53.693
[Crickets chirping]

1661
01:18:56.652 --> 01:18:59.220
- [Lisa] I don't think you're
supposed to be up there.


1662
01:19:00.613 --> 01:19:03.137
- I think better up here.

1663
01:19:03.224 --> 01:19:04.878
- Thinking about your mom?

1664
01:19:08.446 --> 01:19:11.275
Do you remember
anything about her?


1665
01:19:11.362 --> 01:19:12.929
- Not really.

1666
01:19:13.016 --> 01:19:17.543
Every time that I think
that I can see her face,


1667
01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.806
I wonder if it's really her.

1668
01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:23.940
Maybe it's just something
I'm making up in my head.


1669
01:19:25.376 --> 01:19:26.856
- Are you going
to live with her?


1670
01:19:29.685 --> 01:19:30.643
- I guess that I should.

1671
01:19:32.079 --> 01:19:33.428
- You could just
stay here with us.


1672
01:19:33.515 --> 01:19:34.429
Mom and dad would let you,

1673
01:19:34.516 --> 01:19:35.473
I heard them say so.

1674
01:19:35.561 --> 01:19:37.040
- They did?

1675
01:19:37.127 --> 01:19:38.781
- Sure, just tell them
that's what you want.


1676
01:19:38.868 --> 01:19:41.392
- You see, that's the problem,

1677
01:19:41.479 --> 01:19:43.525
it's not about what I want,

1678
01:19:44.918 --> 01:19:47.224
it's about what
God wants for me.


1679
01:19:47.311 --> 01:19:49.183
- Doesn't God care
how you feel about it?


1680
01:19:51.228 --> 01:19:53.013
- Well I reckon he does.

1681
01:19:55.145 --> 01:19:58.758
But he knows what's best
for me better than I do.


1682
01:20:00.368 --> 01:20:01.978
- Well, I'm gonna tell
him it makes you sad


1683
01:20:02.065 --> 01:20:04.938
and all he has to do to
fix it is let you stay.


1684
01:20:05.025 --> 01:20:06.200
Then you'll be happy again.

1685
01:20:09.029 --> 01:20:11.422
- Sometimes he chooses
not to fix things


1686
01:20:12.859 --> 01:20:14.425
and I have to be
okay with that too.


1687
01:20:15.862 --> 01:20:17.864
- Even if it means
you have to leave?


1688
01:20:20.518 --> 01:20:21.868
- Whatever it means.

1689
01:20:24.914 --> 01:20:27.961
I've put my trust in
Jesus my whole life.


1690
01:20:28.962 --> 01:20:30.311
He hasn't let me down yet.

1691
01:20:33.314 --> 01:20:35.011
If he says that I need to go,

1692
01:20:36.839 --> 01:20:38.232
then I should joyfully.

1693
01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:42.845
- Is this one of those trials
that makes you stronger?


1694
01:20:47.284 --> 01:20:49.591
- I think so.

1695
01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.071
- I don't like them very much.

1696

- Yes ma'am.

we're right here.

01:21:11.439 --> 01:21:12.658
We're not going anywhere.

1702
01:21:12.745 --> 01:21:14.137
- Anytime you want to leave,

1703
01:21:14.224 --> 01:21:15.922
just let us know and
we'll come get you.

01:21:17.053 --> 01:21:19.186
- Thank you both for everything.

1705

- [Keith] Come on, let's
move a little further away.


1706
01:21:25.758 --> 01:21:27.237
- No, he might need us.

1707
01:21:27.324 --> 01:21:29.805
- We can't just stand
here and stare at them.


1708
01:21:29.892 --> 01:21:31.154
- He might need us.

1709

- There's a bench over there.

1710

Come on.

1711
01:21:43.689 --> 01:21:47.780
- Oh, I never dreamed you'd
get so tall and handsome.


1712
01:21:47.867 --> 01:21:48.389
Look at you.

1713
01:21:49.912 --> 01:21:52.045
I've missed so much
of your growing up.


1714
01:21:52.132 --> 01:21:53.655
- Why don't we step over here

1715
01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:54.874
and let them speak
alone for a moment?


1716
01:21:54.961 --> 01:21:56.266
- It's all right.

1717
01:21:56.353 --> 01:21:58.791
Mr. Billings and his
associate represent me.


1718
01:21:58.878 --> 01:22:01.271
- You need attorneys
to speak with your son?


1719
01:22:01.358 --> 01:22:02.882
- Of course not.

1720
01:22:02.969 --> 01:22:05.711
I just say the silliest
things sometimes.


1721
01:22:05.798 --> 01:22:07.669
And I wouldn't want
to say or do anything


1722
01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.759
that might mess up my chances
of getting my baby boy back.


1723
01:22:24.033 --> 01:22:26.819
- I haven't been a
baby for a long time.


1724
01:22:26.906 --> 01:22:28.298
- Of course you haven't.

1725
01:22:28.385 --> 01:22:29.909
You're practically a man now.

1726
01:22:35.958 --> 01:22:39.832
- Can we just talk alone, mom?

1727
01:22:41.094 --> 01:22:42.617
- Maybe next time Finch.

1728
01:22:43.836 --> 01:22:45.272
Besides, when this is all over,

1729
01:22:45.359 --> 01:22:47.317
we'll have plenty of
time to talk alone.

So tell me, do you like school?

What subject is your favorite?

1732
01:22:53.846 --> 01:22:57.197
- I like English,
literature especially.


1733
01:22:57.284 --> 01:22:59.547
- I never cared much
for reading books.


1734
01:22:59.634 --> 01:23:01.854
I'm really more of a
magazine girl myself.


1735
01:23:01.941 --> 01:23:03.812
I just love looking
at the pictures


1736
01:23:03.899 --> 01:23:05.422
and hearing about all
the Hollywood stars


1737
01:23:05.509 --> 01:23:07.033
and their glamorous lives.

1738
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.556
With your good looks,

1739
01:23:08.643 --> 01:23:10.601
you could be an actor
in Hollywood movies.


1740
01:23:10.688 --> 01:23:12.429
And then you could
be one of those stars


1741
01:23:12.516 --> 01:23:15.781
that takes his mom as a date
to the Academy Awards show.


1742
01:23:15.868 --> 01:23:17.695
- I just saw my first
movie the other day.


1743
01:23:17.783 --> 01:23:19.306
- Your first movie?

1744
01:23:19.393 --> 01:23:20.960
Who's ever heard
of a 16 year old,

01:23:21.047 --> 01:23:22.918
who hasn't been to a movie?

1746
01:23:23.005 --> 01:23:25.312
- They didn't have
movies up on Briar Rock.


1747
01:23:27.705 --> 01:23:30.839
- Finch, I never meant
to leave you for so long.


1748
01:23:30.926 --> 01:23:33.929
I just, well, I had to
take care of some things


1749
01:23:34.016 --> 01:23:35.975
before I could come
back and get you.


1750
01:23:36.062 --> 01:23:37.019
- What kind of things?

1751
01:23:38.064 --> 01:23:39.674
- Important grownup things.

1752
01:23:41.328 --> 01:23:43.896
- Well you just said that
I was practically grown.

- No, now get out of here.

1909
01:34:36.939 --> 01:34:38.593
You won't have anything
to do with that boy.


1910
01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.029
He's off limits, you got that?

1911
01:34:40.116 --> 01:34:42.423
- I'm not waiting for
the money anymore, Jess.


1912
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.860
- You'll get your money double,

1913
01:34:44.947 --> 01:34:46.340
but I'll need another week.

1914
01:34:47.384 --> 01:34:48.864
- [Bobby] Double, yeah right?

1915
01:34:48.951 --> 01:34:50.344
Come on boy, hurry up.

1916
01:34:50.431 --> 01:34:54.609
- You will double,
no triple, next week.


1917
01:34:54.696 --> 01:34:56.872
Pretty soon, money's not gonna
be a problem for me anymore.


1918
01:34:56.959 --> 01:34:58.744
- [Bobby] You're a
lousy liar, Jess,


1919
01:34:58.831 --> 01:34:59.788
you always have been.

1920
01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:01.573
- Laugh it up, Bobby.

1921
01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.227
But pretty soon, I'm not
gonna need you anymore.


1922
01:35:04.314 --> 01:35:06.534
My son's got property
worth millions


1923
01:35:06.621 --> 01:35:08.014
and after we sell it,

1924
01:35:08.101 --> 01:35:09.929
we're taking off and
never looking back.


1925
01:35:11.321 --> 01:35:13.149
[Dramatic music]

1926
01:35:14.934 --> 01:35:16.979
- [Bobby] You're
a dreamer, Jess,


1927
01:35:17.066 --> 01:35:18.894
with your heads all
up in them clouds.


1928
01:35:20.896 --> 01:35:22.681
Dreaming gets people hurt.

1929
01:35:26.902 --> 01:35:29.818
Look, I'll give
you a few more days


1930
01:35:29.905 --> 01:35:32.647
but if you don't come up
with double what you owe me,


1931
01:35:32.734 --> 01:35:33.909
then the boy's mine.

1932
01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:39.567
Don't think about running off.

1933
01:35:39.654 --> 01:35:40.960
I will come find you.

1934
01:35:42.788 --> 01:35:43.919
[door slams]

1935
01:35:44.006 --> 01:35:45.791
[engine starts up]

1936
01:35:46.966 --> 01:35:48.750
- Finch, Finch.

1937
01:35:48.837 --> 01:35:50.926
[knocking on door]

1938
01:35:51.013 --> 01:35:52.841
Finch?

1939
01:35:52.928 --> 01:35:54.756
That man didn't hurt you did he?

1940
01:35:54.843 --> 01:35:56.410
Finch!

1941
01:35:56.497 --> 01:35:59.282
[banging on door]

1942
01:36:07.377 --> 01:36:09.205
[knocking]

1943
01:36:12.034 --> 01:36:14.820
- Hey, your mom and I have
to go down to the courthouse


1944
01:36:14.907 --> 01:36:15.690
to sign some papers.

1945
01:36:17.126 --> 01:36:19.520
Finch's custody
hearing is today.


1946
01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.870
Keep an eye out
for Jack and Lisa?


1947
01:36:21.957 --> 01:36:22.697
- Yeah.

1948
01:36:28.964 --> 01:36:31.619
- Toby, about what
you said the other day


1949
01:36:31.706 --> 01:36:32.881
about Jack and Finch,

1950
01:36:34.535 --> 01:36:38.844
I didn't know that's how
you felt and I should have.


1951
01:36:38.931 --> 01:36:41.586
I should have paid
more attention to you


1952
01:36:41.673 --> 01:36:44.414
and heard what you were trying
to tell me in different ways.


1953
01:36:46.155 --> 01:36:48.288
Sometimes it has to be
just us, doesn't it?


1954
01:36:50.812 --> 01:36:54.033
You have to know that you could
never be replaced as my son.


1955
01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:56.818
I will always be proud of you.

1956
01:36:58.472 --> 01:36:59.604
- I'm not.

1957
01:37:06.785 --> 01:37:07.916
- That's Finch's journal.

1958
01:37:08.917 --> 01:37:10.049
- I took it from him.

1959
01:37:11.137 --> 01:37:12.486
I let him think I burned it.

1960
01:37:12.573 --> 01:37:13.966
- What?

1961
01:37:14.053 --> 01:37:15.794
- I was mad at him
for losing your book,


1962
01:37:15.881 --> 01:37:18.448
so I let him think
that he lost his.


1963
01:37:18.535 --> 01:37:19.885
- Toby.

1964
01:37:19.972 --> 01:37:22.104
- I thought he was taking
everything from me,


1965
01:37:22.191 --> 01:37:26.326
my friends, my family, you.

1966
01:37:26.413 --> 01:37:27.936
- Hey, hey,

1967
01:37:29.634 --> 01:37:32.985
nobody's ever gonna
take me away from you.


1968
01:37:34.987 --> 01:37:36.597
Last night, I
looked through this


1969
01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:39.252
and I saw this Bible verse
he wrote in the first page


1970
01:37:39.339 --> 01:37:41.428
about trials testing your faith

1971
01:37:41.515 --> 01:37:43.256
and making you more complete

1972
01:37:43.343 --> 01:37:44.736
and that people without faith,

1973
01:37:44.823 --> 01:37:47.129
just get tossed
around by the wind.


1974
01:37:47.216 --> 01:37:48.783
And that's how I feel right now,

1975
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:50.785
like my feet can't
even find the ground.


1976
01:37:52.526 --> 01:37:54.876
- Yeah, I know that feeling.

1977
01:37:57.009 --> 01:38:00.055
I felt that way when I quit
my job and started writing.


1978
01:38:00.142 --> 01:38:00.795
- Really?

1979
01:38:01.927 --> 01:38:03.668
- Everyone thought I was crazy

1980
01:38:03.755 --> 01:38:06.801
to leave something so sure
for something so uncertain.


1981
01:38:08.281 --> 01:38:10.762
Except your mom,
she believes in me.


1982
01:38:12.024 --> 01:38:13.025
- I do too.

1983
01:38:15.897 --> 01:38:18.857
- You know, I think we'll
both feel more grounded


1984
01:38:18.944 --> 01:38:20.336
if we worry less

1985
01:38:20.423 --> 01:38:22.817
about what other people's
opinions of us are


1986
01:38:22.904 --> 01:38:24.732
and focus more on God's.

1987
01:38:26.473 --> 01:38:28.693
- It can't be too good about me.

1988
01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:31.696
- Hey, you will always
be his kind of kid.


1989
01:38:31.783 --> 01:38:33.698
Nothing you do will change that.

1990
01:38:39.573 --> 01:38:41.270
- I want to fix this.

1991
01:38:44.012 --> 01:38:45.535
- You could ask God.

1992
01:38:46.449 --> 01:38:48.582
Just keep it simple.

1993
01:38:50.018 --> 01:38:52.847
Many times he gives
simple answers.


1994
01:38:55.023 --> 01:38:57.025
- You learned that
from Finch, didn't you?


1995
01:38:57.983 --> 01:38:59.985
- His gran actually,

1996
01:39:00.072 --> 01:39:02.727
a woman I would never want to
anger while she's knitting.


1997
01:39:07.166 --> 01:39:10.691
- Dad, I want to go to
the courthouse with you


1998
01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:14.608
but I need a minute
first to ask a question.


1999
01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:19.526
- Okay then, you take a minute,

2000
01:39:19.613 --> 01:39:20.614
I'll go get the car.

2001
01:39:23.573 --> 01:39:26.228
- And thanks for talking to me.

2002
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:29.971
- Anytime.

2003
01:39:41.896 --> 01:39:45.334
- Your client is 20 minutes
late to her own custody hearing.


2004
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:48.860
Mr. Billings, any explanation?

2005
01:39:48.947 --> 01:39:51.863
- I'm sure there was just a
traffic problem, your honor.


2006
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:54.691
Perhaps we can
reconvene tomorrow.


2007
01:39:54.779 --> 01:39:57.259
- I'm not your
dentist, Mr. Billings.


2008
01:39:57.346 --> 01:40:00.262
I do not have another opening
on my docket until July.


2009
01:40:00.349 --> 01:40:01.916
We can reconvene them.

2010
01:40:02.003 --> 01:40:04.571
- I don't believe that would
be in the best interest


2011
01:40:04.658 --> 01:40:06.791
of the mother or the child.

2012
01:40:06.878 --> 01:40:08.140
- Mr. Billings.

2013
01:40:08.227 --> 01:40:09.271
[knocking]

2014
01:40:09.358 --> 01:40:11.012
- We can proceed, your honor.

2015
01:40:20.717 --> 01:40:22.110
You're late.

2016
01:40:22.197 --> 01:40:23.982
- She wouldn't come unless
I got her a new dress.


2017
01:40:24.069 --> 01:40:25.984
[sighs]

2018
01:40:26.071 --> 01:40:28.160
- Nice of you to
join us, Miss Hague.


2019
01:40:28.247 --> 01:40:29.161
- It's nice to be here.

2020
01:40:30.684 --> 01:40:32.251
- In the matter of custody

2021
01:40:32.338 --> 01:40:36.472
of the minor here after referred
to as "Finch Whittaker."


2022
01:40:36.559 --> 01:40:37.647
- Hague.

2023
01:40:37.734 --> 01:40:39.214
- I'm sorry?

2024
01:40:39.301 --> 01:40:41.738
- Finch Hague,
that's his name now.


2025
01:40:41.826 --> 01:40:42.783
- Miss Hague-

2026
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:43.784
[knocking]

2027
01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:45.394
Were we expecting anyone else?

2028
01:40:47.005 --> 01:40:49.137
- Judge Raymond, I am
so sorry to interrupt.


2029
01:40:49.224 --> 01:40:52.184
My husband, Keith and I
are Finch's foster parents.


2030
01:40:52.271 --> 01:40:55.013
- Deputy Brennan, I
appreciate you coming by,


2031
01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.579
but the foster parents

2032
01:40:56.666 --> 01:40:57.972
are not required to be
here for this hearing.


2033
01:40:58.059 --> 01:40:59.844
You can sign your
papers out front.


2034
01:40:59.931 --> 01:41:02.455
- If I could, there
is something I,


2035
01:41:02.542 --> 01:41:04.587
my family and I
would like to say.


2036
01:41:04.674 --> 01:41:06.067
- I object, your honor.

2037
01:41:06.154 --> 01:41:08.330
This woman has a personal
interest in this matter


2038
01:41:08.417 --> 01:41:10.463
and would do anything to
stop these proceedings.


2039
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:11.812
- I'm afraid this really

2040
01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.553
isn't the appropriate
time, Janelle.


2041
01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.989
It'll have to wait.

2042
01:41:15.076 --> 01:41:17.035
- It is very important
that we speak to Finch.


2043
01:41:17.122 --> 01:41:19.037
- This isn't the time.

2044
01:41:19.124 --> 01:41:20.908
Who are all these people?

2045
01:41:20.995 --> 01:41:21.866
- This is my family.

2046
01:41:21.953 --> 01:41:23.824
- I object, your honor.

2047
01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:25.608
- Pipe down, we're not in court.

2048
01:41:25.695 --> 01:41:27.654
- Your honor, before
you make a ruling,


2049
01:41:27.741 --> 01:41:30.526
Finch needs to know that
we don't want him to go.


2050
01:41:30.613 --> 01:41:32.354
- You see Finch has become
a part of our family


2051
01:41:32.441 --> 01:41:33.834
and we can't lose him.

2052
01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.705
- And I need him to
teach me how to hunt.


2053
01:41:35.792 --> 01:41:37.794
- This is highly irregular.

2054
01:41:37.882 --> 01:41:39.927
- Your honor, I lied to him.

2055
01:41:40.014 --> 01:41:41.973
I told him that he didn't
belong at our house


2056
01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.757
and that we weren't his family.

2057
01:41:43.844 --> 01:41:45.759
But in a way we kind of are.

2058
01:41:45.846 --> 01:41:47.456
You see, we fight like brothers.

2059
01:41:47.543 --> 01:41:50.416
I let him believe
that I burned this,


2060
01:41:50.503 --> 01:41:52.897
but I was wrong about a
lot of things, your honor.


2061
01:41:52.984 --> 01:41:54.899
So will you please
tell Finch for me


2062
01:41:54.986 --> 01:41:56.596
how sorry I am

2063
01:41:56.683 --> 01:41:59.816
and that if he wants to stay

this is not a trial,
it's a custody hearing.

You can't declare a
mistrial of a hearing.

everything you've said,

the law is the law.

Miss Hague is seeking
full custody of her son


2081
01:42:38.899 --> 01:42:41.075
and since she is his
biological mother,


2082
01:42:41.162 --> 01:42:42.990
the law protects her rights.

2083
01:42:44.905 --> 01:42:47.690
And I am certain that you
are a very fine young man

all of these good people

2088
01:42:57.222 --> 01:42:58.397
that is not a factor either.

2089

I have no choice but to grant
Miss Hague full custody.
