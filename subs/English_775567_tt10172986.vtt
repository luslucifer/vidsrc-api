1
00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.651
Ooh, give me.

2
00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:24.485
Whatever!
You know, you better be careful


3
00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:27.193
I might just leave you
for your buddy Jughead.


4
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.651
-Original.

5
00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:30.526
Does that mean you're Betty?

6
00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:32.776
You know, I'm Veronica.

7
00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:38.360
Well, you see Jughead,
tell him I stole his cigarette.


8
00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:41.318
You better be careful Archie.

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.568
I heard Jughead
doesn't like thieves.


10
00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:12.235
Seriously,
you're not going to give me one?


11
00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:13.776
Come on.

12
00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:19.985
Psychopomps are entities
whose role is not to charge
the deceased,


13
00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:24.901
but to guide them to
their final destination in the afterlife.

14
00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:36.110
You know, Archie,
your grandma gave me
these binoculars


15
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.651
-and she said they were magical.
- Really?


16
00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:43.485
Yep, she said that sometimes
if you are you looking
through them


17
00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:46.985
that you can see
the spirits of your loved ones.


18
00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:50.193
- Do you see grandma?
- Nope,
all I can see is birds.


19
00:03:56.943 --> 00:03:58.568
Who are you?

20
00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:04.568
Where are we?

21
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.443
Very nice.

22
00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.068
-Where are we?

23
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.693
Archie, I need you to
close your eyes for me.


24
00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:52.151
We're going to do an exercise
to put you back into those
dreams you've been having.


25
00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:54.818
Take a deep breath.

26
00:05:57.526 --> 00:05:59.110
Relax your mind.

27
00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:03.026
What do you see?

28
00:06:03.068 --> 00:06:04.901
Tell me what you dreamed.

29
00:06:07.193 --> 00:06:12.110
I'm standing
in a sketchy restroom.


30
00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.526
I walk into the room.

31
00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:27.818
I hear a electric buzzing sound
behind me.


32
00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:33.693
I turn around.

33
00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:37.901
-Keep going.

34
00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:40.651
I hear a woman scream.

35
00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:44.110
I want to help her...

36
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.110
but it's blocking the doorway.

37
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:53.360
It's blocking the doorway.

38
00:06:58.068 --> 00:07:02.360
I see bugs
coming out of a TV screen.


39
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:07.568
They're coming for me.

40
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.151
-They're coming for me!
- Archie.


41
00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:13.026
Open your eyes.

42
00:07:16.526 --> 00:07:18.526
Birdie.

43
00:07:18.568 --> 00:07:20.151
Who's Birdie?

44
00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:23.651
You have amnesia,

45
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.568
but your subconscious is trying
to help you remember.


46
00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:31.276
You should go back
to these places you're seeing
in your mind


47
00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:36.110
and maybe they'll trigger
your memory.


48
00:07:57.276 --> 00:08:01.026
I got a special
ticket just for you.


49
00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:17.276
Hi, Archie.
I'm Dr. Dunn.


50
00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:20.276
We have to talk.

51
00:08:20.318 --> 00:08:23.693
That ticket you got there
that's for a free meal
and for a free trip.


52
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:38.151
Time to eat, Archie.

53
00:08:39.026 --> 00:08:41.276
We made some food for you.

54
00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:50.818
Archie, the reason I brought
you here is to enlighten you.


55
00:08:52.943 --> 00:08:55.651
This meal is specially
formulated for you.


56
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:03.610
You've been walking around like
a zombie since your
unfortunate event.


57
00:09:06.818 --> 00:09:08.276
I can help you.

58
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:11.443
We can help you.

59
00:09:12.401 --> 00:09:14.610
All you have to do
is eat your food.


60
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.693
Then you'll know what's what.

61
00:09:23.568 --> 00:09:25.651
Isn't that
what we all want to know?


62
00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:30.318
Where we come from?
Where we go when
the curtains go down?


63
00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:39.776
We're born into a question mark
and then we're just left here
with no answers to anything.


64
00:09:39.818 --> 00:09:42.485
We flood our youth with vanity

65
00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:46.860
and our old age is filled
with fear of the unknown.


66
00:09:48.193 --> 00:09:50.193
That's how you feel, right?

67
00:09:50.235 --> 00:09:52.318
You want to know what happened.

68
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:55.651
Well, now you can.

69
00:10:00.026 --> 00:10:01.818
It's time to eat.

70
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.110
It's time
to take that final ride.


71
00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:08.068
Eat your food, Archie Finch.

72
00:10:09.193 --> 00:10:10.693
I can't.

73
00:10:12.318 --> 00:10:15.443
I'm sure I'll be hungry soon.

74
00:10:23.026 --> 00:10:24.151
Okay...

75
00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.068
another meal's
always around the corner.


76
00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:35.985
Into the kitchen we go,
where we end up nobody knows.


77
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:43.818
Do you know the muffin-man
The muffin-man?


78
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.860
Do you know the muffin-man
Who lives on Drury Lane?


79
00:10:57.193 --> 00:11:00.860
-]

80
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:08.901
Be right there.

81
00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:15.443
Archie!

82
00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:17.985
Come on in.

83
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.735
Come on in, Archie.
I'll be right there.


84
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:40.110
Archie,
you don't look so good.


85
00:12:45.568 --> 00:12:48.360
So how's your memory?

86
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.860
Do you remember anything new?

87
00:12:52.568 --> 00:12:56.485
It's like all the puzzle pieces
are out there...


88
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.818
but I... just can't find it.

89
00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:05.943
It's like I'm blind...

90
00:13:07.818 --> 00:13:10.193
and I just can't see them.

91
00:13:10.235 --> 00:13:15.568
I'm here for you not just as
your assistant,
but as your friend.


92
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.151
You were once there for me
during a hard time and I want to
be there for you also.


93
00:13:27.193 --> 00:13:29.693
Hey, it'll...
it'll come back to you.


94
00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:36.401
Here they are.

95
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:41.735
All your contacts.

96
00:13:44.276 --> 00:13:46.443
Now I can find Ed.

97
00:13:58.443 --> 00:14:00.443
Got to say...

98
00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:03.110
you're not the Archie
I remember very well.


99
00:14:05.068 --> 00:14:07.276
I don't remember you at all

100
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.818
but I'm told
that you're key to my success.


101
00:14:16.235 --> 00:14:20.068
One of the keys,
definitely the skeleton key.


102
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.235
You got that right, Ed.
You're definitely a skeleton.


103
00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:27.193
I keep telling him to eat some
steak and egg, all he wants is
coffee, coffee, coffee.


104
00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:30.485
If I don't have coffee and
chokes, I'm living in the land
of the dead here, Kim.


105
00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:33.235
Ain't we all?

106
00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:47.443
This is the guy
that's going to find your film.


107
00:14:50.485 --> 00:14:52.068
It's just a stand-in.

108
00:14:55.318 --> 00:14:56.735
And this is his girlfriend.

109
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.651
She wants to be
the lead actress in your film


110
00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:06.985
and if you let her
her boyfriend will fund
the whole movie.


111
00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:11.735
He'll fund
the whole film?


112
00:15:11.776 --> 00:15:16.610
Yes, and I bet he'd throw a
really good wrap party like a
cowboy on his own dime.


113
00:15:18.693 --> 00:15:19.568
Hmm.

114
00:15:24.276 --> 00:15:28.193
Oh, my doctor says that
if I get back to doing things


115
00:15:28.235 --> 00:15:32.610
that I have been doing before,

116
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:36.193
maybe I'll start to remember
something in my past.


117
00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:40.443
Sounds like a yes to me.

118
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.485
Oh, yeah.

119
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.151
Hmm, attaboy, Arch.

120
00:15:51.193 --> 00:15:55.443
Oh, one more
thing I forgot to mention.


121
00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:59.693
His girlfriend is, um...

122
00:16:03.318 --> 00:16:06.235
a little like out there.

123
00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:10.735
-How so?
-She sees things.


124
00:16:12.568 --> 00:16:14.401
Things?

125
00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:18.401
Yeah, but she's on some crazy
shit that makes you go bye-bye.


126
00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:22.276
I could use some crazy shit.

127
00:16:22.318 --> 00:16:26.401
I've been experiencing
some weird things lately myself.


128
00:16:27.901 --> 00:16:31.026
Really? Like what?

129
00:16:33.318 --> 00:16:37.318
I don't know.
Maybe this amnesia thing...


130
00:16:39.276 --> 00:16:41.068
but...

131
00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:44.443
anyway.

132
00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:49.318
-Let's make a movie.
-Attaboy, Arch.


133
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.651
To our lead actress.

134
00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:05.860
A star is born.

135
00:17:09.068 --> 00:17:12.318
- You thirsty?
-Not today.


136
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.068
And what have you
been busying yourself with?


137
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.443
Well, to be completely honest...

138
00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:24.151
I've been losing chunks of time.

139
00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:29.401
You can't expect for your brain
to be in tip-top shape after
what happened to you, Archie.


140
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.110
Yeah, I know.

141
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:37.151
I don't even remember
how I got here.


142
00:17:37.193 --> 00:17:40.985
Maybe seeing some things from
your past will jog your memory.


143
00:17:43.776 --> 00:17:49.860
Actually, there was one thing
I was hoping to take a look at.


144
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.068
Do you still have that
belt buckle dad left me?


145
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.818
Ah, so you do
remember something.


146
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.610
Look! Look deep.

147
00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:12.568
Deeper.

148
00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:17.360
Think about what's down there.

149
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:20.276
What's been there for ages.

150
00:18:21.193 --> 00:18:22.776
No one knows.

151
00:18:22.818 --> 00:18:26.151
Before the dinosaurs,
this was here.


152
00:18:27.735 --> 00:18:33.193
So dark, so deep,
so many things hidden,


153
00:18:34.818 --> 00:18:39.360
we'll never know,
we'll never ever know.


154
00:18:40.276 --> 00:18:41.776
Just think about it.

155
00:18:43.068 --> 00:18:48.401
Imagine what could be there.

156
00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:52.651
Search your mind.
Every little crevice.


157
00:18:52.693 --> 00:18:56.901
Search. Deeper.

158
00:18:56.943 --> 00:18:59.360
Deeper.

159
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:02.693
Yes, you see it.

160
00:19:02.735 --> 00:19:05.526
You begin to see. Yes, yes.

161
00:19:05.568 --> 00:19:10.651
I can tell.
Yes, you found it.


162
00:19:10.693 --> 00:19:13.901
Ah, I can tell.
I can feel it myself.


163
00:19:13.943 --> 00:19:16.443
Oh! Oh, yes.

164
00:19:16.485 --> 00:19:20.651
Wonder of wonders, it's there.
It's there.


165
00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:24.693
I see it in your eye,
windows to the soul.


166
00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:26.651
You can't hide a thing.

167
00:19:46.776 --> 00:19:50.151
I think I can get behind
that. I'll see you there.


168
00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:02.985
Like clockwork, you always seem
to bring my drink
right when I need it,


169
00:20:03.026 --> 00:20:06.235
fulfilling a woman's duty
to servitude.


170
00:20:06.276 --> 00:20:09.110
That's not very nice.

171
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:33.318
How can I help you?

172
00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.401
What just happened?

173
00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:41.193
Call it performance art.

174
00:20:44.818 --> 00:20:48.693
I see you don't have
any clocks in this place.


175
00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:53.026
Do you happen to have the time?

176
00:20:55.985 --> 00:21:01.901
We don't have the time,
but we do have a phone.


177
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:08.693
Use that card.

178
00:21:10.735 --> 00:21:13.026
Can I get you a drink, young
man?


179
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.818
I'll take a martini.

180
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.776
Coming right up.

181
00:21:46.943 --> 00:21:54.026
There we go. A warm belly
is nice, like a warm bed or
a warm lady for that matter.


182
00:21:54.068 --> 00:21:56.026
How you doing, Son?

183
00:22:01.193 --> 00:22:03.360
Do you happen to have the time?

184
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.568
This man wants to
know if I have the time.


185
00:22:11.818 --> 00:22:15.235
Piss on time.

186
00:22:17.485 --> 00:22:19.526
Here at the Evil Olive...

187
00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:24.318
we leave time at the door.

188
00:22:26.026 --> 00:22:29.276
Look, I didn't
mean any disrespect.


189
00:22:31.068 --> 00:22:36.943
It's just I've been waiting here
for someone over an hour.


190
00:22:39.151 --> 00:22:43.693
I just feel like
I've been here much longer.


191
00:22:53.568 --> 00:22:55.068
Yeah, she's here.

192
00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.943
She stopped that.

193
00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:03.610
Now let's see if I can get this
rogue soul to realize his
destiny.


194
00:23:10.651 --> 00:23:16.693
Why don't you spend your time
downstairs in our VIP room,
wait for your friend Ed there.


195
00:23:51.235 --> 00:23:53.860
-Archie.
-Yeah.


196
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:59.610
I'm Thana. Ed sent me.
He couldn't make it.


197
00:23:59.651 --> 00:24:01.693
Thought you
might need the company.


198
00:24:01.735 --> 00:24:03.485
Oh.

199
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:06.151
He insisted.

200
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.360
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, uh, he's fine.


201
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:16.443
-I'll get us some drinks.
-No need.


202
00:24:16.485 --> 00:24:18.318
I ordered us a few drinks.

203
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.735
You get the next round.

204
00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:57.735
What's this drink called?

205
00:24:57.776 --> 00:25:00.693
"A Short Trip to Hell."

206
00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:10.610
Someone is as serious
as the plague up in here.


207
00:25:14.485 --> 00:25:17.193
It's just a rum and Coke.

208
00:25:17.235 --> 00:25:22.360
I take it you're the type of guy
that fancies a simple drink,
like a rum and Coke.


209
00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:30.318
I guess you'd be right.

210
00:25:31.651 --> 00:25:34.026
What's your favorite drink
of choice?


211
00:25:35.568 --> 00:25:40.610
Dirty whore's bath water.
Classic drink.


212
00:25:47.651 --> 00:25:52.276
You want to see my head spin
around, order me
that second drink.


213
00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:54.610
Yes, Ma'am.

214
00:26:02.026 --> 00:26:04.485
Get the lady an exorcist.

215
00:26:30.776 --> 00:26:32.610
Oh, I felt that one.

216
00:26:34.276 --> 00:26:38.193
One of my favorites.

217
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.693
You poisoned me.

218
00:27:56.568 --> 00:28:01.276
I know. I know.
You'll be fine.


219
00:28:01.318 --> 00:28:03.610
We just have to get you home.

220
00:28:03.651 --> 00:28:07.026
I'm flying like
a thousand bats here, babe.


221
00:28:07.068 --> 00:28:08.860
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.


222
00:28:08.901 --> 00:28:10.151
I feel sick.

223
00:28:12.318 --> 00:28:14.860
I know it was a long night.

224
00:28:16.068 --> 00:28:19.526
I have heard that
morning sickness is never fun.


225
00:28:27.776 --> 00:28:32.193
Now let's get you to bed.

226
00:28:33.818 --> 00:28:39.193
Please,
I need some stomach medicine.


227
00:28:40.276 --> 00:28:43.526
Anything. Give me something.

228
00:28:44.526 --> 00:28:50.276
I've got something, but it
will take you out of this world.


229
00:28:50.318 --> 00:28:52.193
Do you accept that?

230
00:28:52.235 --> 00:28:55.443
It'll take away all the pain.

231
00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:58.610
Yes, the pain is killing me.

232
00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.568
Eat up.

233
00:29:32.026 --> 00:29:34.610
It's the only way
to cure your agony.


234
00:30:09.193 --> 00:30:13.318
Thank you. Thank you.

235
00:30:14.818 --> 00:30:16.568
Thank you.

236
00:30:27.401 --> 00:30:30.026
I need you to finish your food,
Archie.


237
00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:41.443
Don't be ungrateful.
Finish your food.


238
00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:42.776
It's for your health.

239
00:30:44.568 --> 00:30:46.818
Is that human blood?

240
00:31:00.526 --> 00:31:03.901
Eat your fucking food.

241
00:31:12.235 --> 00:31:14.151
Ah!

242
00:32:18.526 --> 00:32:22.276
Oh, so you're the camera.
Let me take a look in there.


243
00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:19.443
Archie!

244
00:33:28.651 --> 00:33:32.610
You're coming with us.

245
00:33:39.151 --> 00:33:43.651
- Look, Arch,
we need to talk.
-Where have you been?


246
00:33:43.693 --> 00:33:45.526
No, no, no, man.

247
00:33:47.318 --> 00:33:49.568
Who's that psycho bitch, Thana?

248
00:33:51.485 --> 00:33:56.693
Look, man, you know
this industry,
they're off their rockers.


249
00:33:56.735 --> 00:34:00.901
I got caught up that night.
I got a little drunk, sorry.


250
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.068
She started poisoning me.

251
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:07.360
Started feeding me blood.

252
00:34:09.568 --> 00:34:12.485
That's ten miles
from the rocker, Ed.


253
00:34:12.526 --> 00:34:13.985
What the fuck!

254
00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:17.235
Look, I don't know these people.

255
00:34:17.276 --> 00:34:18.943
We don't know these people.

256
00:34:18.985 --> 00:34:21.568
That's just how things are, man.

257
00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.526
What you need to worry about,
Archie Finch,


258
00:34:24.568 --> 00:34:28.985
is getting back into
the director's chair,
back in the zone.


259
00:34:29.026 --> 00:34:32.110
Everything else,
man, will take care of itself.


260
00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:34.818
Yeah.

261
00:34:37.193 --> 00:34:38.568
I guess.

262
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.276
It all remains to be seen.

263
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:10.943
Hey! Any of you know
where to get a...


264
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.485
There's a lighter
in your pocket.


265
00:35:44.193 --> 00:35:47.693
Burn the airplane.
Hurry up.


266
00:35:47.735 --> 00:35:50.276
You're being watched.

267
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.276
Once inside Hardy's house,

268
00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:58.818
go up the first set of stairs,
knock on the door at the top.


269
00:36:25.193 --> 00:36:28.526
Hardy walks, you follow.

270
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.735
Hello.

271
00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:26.026
Hi.

272
00:37:27.735 --> 00:37:29.985
Come look at my dollhouse.

273
00:37:33.068 --> 00:37:37.360
He's been stuck
on the second floor
for quite some time.


274
00:37:37.401 --> 00:37:41.693
It's been a thousand years, if
you measure it in human years.


275
00:37:41.735 --> 00:37:43.985
That's a bit.

276
00:37:44.026 --> 00:37:49.276
Upstairs or downstairs,
he can't seem
to make up his mind.


277
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.735
Careful, you might fall in.

278
00:37:58.485 --> 00:38:01.026
Right, I wouldn't want that.

279
00:38:01.985 --> 00:38:05.318
Why can't he go
up to the third floor?


280
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.235
Well, you can't
make anyone do anything.


281
00:38:12.026 --> 00:38:14.193
Archie.

282
00:38:14.235 --> 00:38:17.110
How'd you know my name?

283
00:38:19.568 --> 00:38:24.943
There's this thing that he does
that I can't quite figure out,


284
00:38:24.985 --> 00:38:29.318
but... but maybe you can help me
figure it out.


285
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.235
-What does he do?
-Come, come.


286
00:38:40.776 --> 00:38:41.943
I got to go.

287
00:38:43.193 --> 00:38:46.026
Yes, you do.

288
00:38:46.068 --> 00:38:48.610
But, hmm...

289
00:38:48.651 --> 00:38:55.485
is it upstairs or down?

290
00:39:02.401 --> 00:39:04.693
What is he doing here?

291
00:39:04.735 --> 00:39:09.526
-Done. Done, look, I'm done.
- You lost. You lost.


292
00:39:09.568 --> 00:39:10.860
Come sit.

293
00:39:12.568 --> 00:39:14.193
Sit with Hardy.

294
00:39:21.985 --> 00:39:27.735
So, why does a man feel
the need to carry a little
killing machine on his person?


295
00:39:27.776 --> 00:39:31.485
Oh! Well, yeah,
that's right, protection.


296
00:39:31.526 --> 00:39:36.485
Well, allow me to provide you
with your new best friend.


297
00:39:36.526 --> 00:39:38.110
Open the box.

298
00:39:59.985 --> 00:40:05.568
Ah, I think I see what ails you.

299
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.651
A woman can get a fella
into all sorts of trouble.


300
00:40:08.693 --> 00:40:15.318
For instance, a woman
scorned or a damsel in distress.


301
00:40:16.693 --> 00:40:20.443
You ever rescued
a damsel in distress?


302
00:40:20.485 --> 00:40:23.901
Anyways,
I thought I should tell you,


303
00:40:23.943 --> 00:40:26.651
some guy used his gun
to kill his own self.


304
00:40:26.693 --> 00:40:31.568
He killed himself good,
real good, over a dame.


305
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:35.985
Even worse it was a gift
given to him by a dear friend,


306
00:40:36.026 --> 00:40:39.568
but I got it now,
it works and it's for sale.


307
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.151
Consider that
your new King Kong,


308
00:40:42.193 --> 00:40:45.610
just in case you're the, uh,
damsel in distress.


309
00:40:45.651 --> 00:40:48.568
Now, let's get you out of here.

310
00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:07.526
Pull over.

311
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.860
You guys have been
following me since 1983.


312
00:41:20.901 --> 00:41:22.568
It seems.

313
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.443
Oh, like a couple
of time cops, huh?


314
00:41:24.485 --> 00:41:26.693
I like that.

315
00:41:27.776 --> 00:41:29.443
You're Archibald Finch?

316
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.943
Yup.

317
00:41:34.985 --> 00:41:38.818
The director of low-budget
trash, Archibald Finch.


318
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.818
What can I help you guys with?

319
00:41:46.443 --> 00:41:49.901
Ah, just some normal stuff.
Murder.


320
00:41:52.318 --> 00:41:54.443
Got enemies, Archie?

321
00:41:54.485 --> 00:41:56.526
I don't know.

322
00:41:56.568 --> 00:41:58.318
I have amnesia.

323
00:42:00.526 --> 00:42:03.901
Oh, so he might have enemies

324
00:42:03.943 --> 00:42:09.193
but he just don't remember, huh.

325
00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:15.110
This is so weird.
I mean brain injuries.


326
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.193
Just all mysterious, you know...

327
00:42:19.276 --> 00:42:23.610
makes us think how much like
them goddamn bots we really are.


328
00:42:23.651 --> 00:42:26.526
You know I'm starting to think
we're actually in a simulation,
Detective James.


329
00:42:26.568 --> 00:42:29.735
Oh, oh, Pete.
Look, oh, oh, I'm glitching.


330
00:42:29.776 --> 00:42:33.776
Oh, oh.
I'm all Android, baby.


331
00:42:35.276 --> 00:42:39.068
-Mm. Mm. Mm.
-I'm more of an Apple guy.


332
00:42:40.235 --> 00:42:43.651
You've bitten into
any, uh, rotten apples, Archie?


333
00:42:45.526 --> 00:42:47.526
Women can be rotten apples,
too, right?


334
00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:51.943
Both sour and sweet.

335
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.776
Some are even occupied
by that little worm.


336
00:42:57.818 --> 00:43:01.193
But that's never stopped you,
has it, Archie?


337
00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:04.943
You know, sometimes we even bite
into that nasty little seed.


338
00:43:04.985 --> 00:43:07.110
And what is that seed
filled with?


339
00:43:08.026 --> 00:43:09.318
Cyanide.

340
00:43:13.651 --> 00:43:15.443
Man.

341
00:43:15.485 --> 00:43:17.985
We're just messing with you,
man.


342
00:43:18.026 --> 00:43:24.568
It will take a whole lot
of, uh, apple worms and cyanide
seeds to kill a human, right?


343
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.151
But only one woman.

344
00:43:30.026 --> 00:43:31.818
Here's the business, Archie.

345
00:43:33.526 --> 00:43:36.193
Someone tried to do
a hit on you, but...


346
00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:40.401
only he survived.

347
00:43:40.443 --> 00:43:43.068
Why would someone
want to do that to you?


348
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.276
Yeah.

349
00:43:46.276 --> 00:43:47.860
I honestly don't know.

350
00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:50.568
We think you do know.

351
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:55.568
We think you're using this
amnesia as an excuse to forget
something you regret doing.


352
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.735
Yeah, like banging
your financier's lady,


353
00:43:59.776 --> 00:44:02.026
who's also supposed to be
the star of your film.


354
00:44:02.068 --> 00:44:04.110
Whoa! The plot thickens.

355
00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:07.068
-Who is she?
- You mean who was she?


356
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.026
She's dead.
Her boyfriend did it.


357
00:44:10.068 --> 00:44:12.901
Boy what kind of mess
he did on her, you know.


358
00:44:12.943 --> 00:44:15.110
Cut her every which way.

359
00:44:15.151 --> 00:44:18.985
-Only the bastard demon
have the guts to do it himself.


360
00:44:32.818 --> 00:44:37.485
Archie, they're after you, baby.

361
00:44:37.526 --> 00:44:42.443
Listen to me,
you have two paths, Archie.


362
00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:45.360
You have to choose
the right one.


363
00:44:45.401 --> 00:44:50.026
You don't want to go with them. 
They can't be trusted.

364
00:44:50.068 --> 00:44:52.026
Those weren't cops.

365
00:44:52.068 --> 00:44:54.110
Don't fall for their tricks.

366
00:44:56.151 --> 00:44:59.276
Go to the El Rancho Motel
tonight and you will
remember me.


367
00:44:59.318 --> 00:45:02.610
Tonight, you're coming with us.

368
00:45:02.651 --> 00:45:03.610
Fuck!

369
00:45:06.693 --> 00:45:09.318
Oh, ooh fuck!

370
00:45:13.235 --> 00:45:16.360
You can't kill me, you fool.

371
00:45:29.318 --> 00:45:32.526
Wake up, Archie.

372
00:45:32.568 --> 00:45:37.235
We have been searching
for you for so long,


373
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:39.860
but this is your chance.

374
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:44.651
This is your chance
to finally be set free.


375
00:45:57.818 --> 00:46:00.068
Open your mind.

376
00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:05.860
This is how you kill a birdie.

377
00:46:05.901 --> 00:46:08.693
Get her in the tub.

378
00:46:08.735 --> 00:46:09.776
Action.

379
00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:18.651
Jughead wants
his cigarettes back.


380
00:46:20.735 --> 00:46:25.193
-You see Jughead,
tell him I stole his cigarette.


381
00:46:25.235 --> 00:46:27.026
Birdie.

382
00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.235
Fuck!

383
00:46:34.318 --> 00:46:40.026
Watch closely, Archie.
This is how you died.


384
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.068
I really thought the birds
understood my chirps.


385
00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:48.485
My dad said, "Anne
you spend all your time talking
to the damn birds,


386
00:46:48.526 --> 00:46:50.776
-you should have been born
with a beak."


387
00:46:50.818 --> 00:46:54.943
So he gave me the nickname
Birdie Anne and it kind of
stuck, I guess.


388
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.693
Well, she doesn't have a beak,
but I'll tell you one thing,


389
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:05.068
she's got superb acting skills
and she's ready to fly
all over Hollywood.


390
00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:08.735
Now, what's the
name of this flick?


391
00:47:08.776 --> 00:47:12.026
-The film is called Retrovision.
-Oh, wow.


392
00:47:12.068 --> 00:47:14.026
- Retrovision?
- I like that.


393
00:47:14.068 --> 00:47:18.401
Weird title, but,
hey, if it's good.


394
00:47:18.443 --> 00:47:20.568
Well, I, for one,
think the title is very unique.


395
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.318
We read it and I am...

396
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.151
um, we're real excited
about the role I'll be playing.


397
00:47:26.193 --> 00:47:28.651
We had a problem
with the love scene though.


398
00:47:28.693 --> 00:47:31.901
We would like you to make it
a bit more suggestive.


399
00:47:31.943 --> 00:47:36.151
I'm not too comfortable seeing
my little Birdie acting in a
provocative way.


400
00:47:36.193 --> 00:47:38.901
Wren's a jealous boyfriend.

401
00:47:39.818 --> 00:47:42.151
Look, I'll do whatever is
necessary to be in your film


402
00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:44.860
as long as it's done
in an artistic way.


403
00:47:44.901 --> 00:47:49.110
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Very classy.


404
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:51.985
Well, I'm the one
with the cash cannon shooting
dollar bills around,


405
00:47:52.026 --> 00:47:54.401
so this better be
a professional shoot.


406
00:47:54.443 --> 00:47:57.651
I don't want to find out
I was funding a porno,


407
00:47:57.693 --> 00:48:00.193
but anything for my little
Birdie.


408
00:48:00.235 --> 00:48:03.693
If she wants to be an actress,
so be it.


409
00:48:05.776 --> 00:48:08.068
So, do I got the part?

410
00:48:09.943 --> 00:48:12.026
-You got the part.
-Yay!


411
00:48:12.068 --> 00:48:14.610
-To the big time.

412
00:48:17.568 --> 00:48:22.193
So, Mr. Archie, when you become
a big film director


413
00:48:22.235 --> 00:48:27.735
will you let it be known all
over Tinseltown that Wren made
you who you are?


414
00:48:30.276 --> 00:48:32.526
I'll shout it from the rooftops.

415
00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:36.735
Maybe we'll make a
Wren biopic one day,


416
00:48:36.776 --> 00:48:38.901
about a self-made--

417
00:48:40.401 --> 00:48:42.318
What's wrong with her?

418
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.318
Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh.
No, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.


419
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.276
There's nothing to be scared of.
There's nothing there, okay.


420
00:48:48.318 --> 00:48:51.193
Hush little Birdie,
don't say a word.


421
00:48:51.235 --> 00:48:55.568
Poppa's going to buy you
a role in a movie.


422
00:48:56.568 --> 00:48:58.401
What's happening? Is...

423
00:48:58.443 --> 00:49:00.485
she getting into character
or...?


424
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.485
This will kill me.

425
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:10.151
Honey, no, no. Never, never.

426
00:49:11.943 --> 00:49:13.818
You're mine.

427
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.443
I'll never let anyone hurt you,
not even me.


428
00:49:20.735 --> 00:49:24.568
Ed,
Ed will be calling you to...


429
00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:29.276
work out the legal stuff.

430
00:49:33.151 --> 00:49:35.026
They say I can play the part.

431
00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.193
Who are they?

432
00:49:38.235 --> 00:49:40.485
Babe, he already knows that.

433
00:49:40.526 --> 00:49:44.193
I'll let you do anything
you want if it makes you happy.


434
00:49:44.235 --> 00:49:46.485
Of course,
you can play the part.


435
00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:58.443
Can I tell you a story, Archie?

436
00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:01.735
Yeah, sure.

437
00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:07.860
Let's call it
the unfortunate bad fortune
of Dr. Mind Fuck.


438
00:50:09.193 --> 00:50:13.443
-Sounds like a knockoff.
- Oh, you'll like him.


439
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:18.276
There once was a shrink
named Dr. Mind Fuck,


440
00:50:18.318 --> 00:50:21.776
who was treating a certain woman
with a mental disorder.


441
00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:28.610
She started seeing things
that weren't there like
this bug that talks to her.


442
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:32.443
So the doctor
decided to help her


443
00:50:32.485 --> 00:50:36.276
and she believed that he can
make this bug go away.


444
00:50:37.235 --> 00:50:40.860
But the bug had already
planted its roots
into her beautiful mind


445
00:50:40.901 --> 00:50:45.360
and the doc's experiments,
they made her much worse.


446
00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:52.276
Her true love knew this and he
just had to stop this evil doc.


447
00:50:53.276 --> 00:50:58.526
One day Dr. Fr...
I mean Dr. Mind Fuck


448
00:50:58.568 --> 00:50:59.985
went on a fishing trip.

449
00:51:01.568 --> 00:51:06.110
He had an accident and just like
that he became the fish food.


450
00:51:08.526 --> 00:51:10.443
Don't be like Dr. Mind Fuck.

451
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.651
I... I would... Never.

452
00:51:16.735 --> 00:51:20.651
Good and keep it
professional with my Birdie.


453
00:51:20.693 --> 00:51:24.568
Maybe then you won't become
another cautionary tale.


454
00:51:57.735 --> 00:51:59.276
There you go.

455
00:52:02.818 --> 00:52:04.610
I know. I know.

456
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.318
Look, calm down, Ed.

457
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:19.818
He turns out to be a reptilian
humanoid, we always have Donnie
the investor.


458
00:52:21.818 --> 00:52:24.526
So, let's talk.

459
00:52:29.651 --> 00:52:35.110
Ed said that you want

460
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:39.776
100, I want 100% ownership
of your film


461
00:52:39.818 --> 00:52:43.485
and fuck Ed,
this is all about you and me.


462
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.485
100%!

463
00:52:47.526 --> 00:52:49.735
What the hell
are you talking about?


464
00:53:07.485 --> 00:53:08.818
So, here's the spill.

465
00:53:10.651 --> 00:53:13.776
I want to fund your movie
and then shelf it.


466
00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:19.401
You're fucking with me, right?

467
00:53:20.735 --> 00:53:23.776
No, no.
I know what you're thinking.


468
00:53:23.818 --> 00:53:25.943
Why would I
want to shelf my film?


469
00:53:28.235 --> 00:53:31.610
Of course, you'd ask that,
you poor little man.


470
00:53:32.818 --> 00:53:36.860
-Well, here it is,
Birdie is addicting.
- Sighs.


471
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:38.318
She's my...

472
00:53:39.526 --> 00:53:45.193
I don't know, crack,
but she has left me before it.


473
00:53:46.401 --> 00:53:48.068
Well, I can't have that, Archie.

474
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.985
I need my control back.

475
00:53:54.068 --> 00:53:57.235
How would shelfing
my film help you with that?


476
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.693
If I own the film, I own her.

477
00:54:01.735 --> 00:54:04.360
She doesn't have to know
the film is shelved.


478
00:54:04.401 --> 00:54:06.943
I'm her manager and her agent.

479
00:54:06.985 --> 00:54:10.818
As far as she knows
I'm just shopping around town
like a hungry shark.


480
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:15.818
Plus, she needs something
to do to keep her sane, saner.


481
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:22.568
But you're not going to shop it?

482
00:54:26.443 --> 00:54:28.526
Maybe at some point...

483
00:54:28.568 --> 00:54:30.401
but until then

484
00:54:30.443 --> 00:54:34.610
I'm just going to dangle your
script like a carrot on a stick.


485
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:36.401
You're out of your fucking mind,

486
00:54:36.443 --> 00:54:38.401
if you think I'm going to give
up my film,


487
00:54:38.443 --> 00:54:41.443
so you can play your sick
twisted game with your
girlfriend.


488
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:46.443
What do I look like to you?
A goddamn circus monkey?


489
00:54:53.693 --> 00:54:56.693
Hold that thought,
Curious George.


490
00:55:01.943 --> 00:55:06.360
Big Pie give me a call if
you change your mind, okay.


491
00:55:48.068 --> 00:55:49.693
Hey, yo, Tony. Hurry it up.

492
00:55:49.735 --> 00:55:53.943
Come on, come on, come on. Uh...

493
00:55:53.985 --> 00:55:56.568
Really? Really?

494
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:10.318
Big Pie, hey.
How've you been?


495
00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:14.776
I'm sorry
I didn't quite catch that.


496
00:56:14.818 --> 00:56:16.943
You sound like
you've got a cold.


497
00:56:16.985 --> 00:56:19.735
Your voice
seems a little hoarse.


498
00:56:21.776 --> 00:56:24.193
Change of heart, really?

499
00:56:24.235 --> 00:56:26.443
You know what?
You don't need to answer that.


500
00:56:26.485 --> 00:56:29.485
You're a sensible guy.
I know.


501
00:56:29.526 --> 00:56:31.985
Okay, we will talk
soon though, okay?


502
00:56:32.026 --> 00:56:33.985
Oh, and for your sore throat...

503
00:56:40.526 --> 00:56:43.860
Oh, I sure hope Big Pie gets
well real soon.


504
00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:47.943
So tomorrow night I'm
hosting this gentleman's party.


505
00:56:47.985 --> 00:56:51.693
You should come.
We are making a flick after all.


506
00:56:51.735 --> 00:56:55.693
It'll be at my friend's place
and it has an underground
dungeon.


507
00:56:55.735 --> 00:56:59.235
We'll celebrate and party like
rock stars before we burn out.


508
00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:07.276
Tell you what? Rip up the check
and walk away or cash it.


509
00:57:07.318 --> 00:57:10.526
I'll be checking my bank account
to see your decision.


510
00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:22.485
When's the last time you ever
got fifty thousand dollars for
being a director, let alone 50.


511
00:57:23.985 --> 00:57:29.360
Think about it and maybe then
I'll see you at my little
shindig tomorrow night.


512
00:57:31.776 --> 00:57:37.276
One more thing, when you do show
up could you bring your video
camera with you?


513
00:57:37.318 --> 00:57:39.818
I've got something
I want you to record for me.


514
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:42.276
It'll be real special.

515
00:57:42.318 --> 00:57:43.985
Can you do this for me?

516
00:57:46.693 --> 00:57:50.610
I got this sneaking little
feeling you'll make
a special appearance.


517
00:57:52.318 --> 00:57:53.860
I need to talk to you.

518
00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:57.818
What's going on?

519
00:57:59.443 --> 00:58:01.693
I can't get a hold of Ed.

520
00:58:01.735 --> 00:58:03.193
It's not like him.

521
00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.235
I think something's wrong.

522
00:58:06.276 --> 00:58:07.901
Tell me what happened?

523
00:58:09.026 --> 00:58:11.276
Ed, he got a call
from an investor, Donnie.


524
00:58:11.318 --> 00:58:14.651
He was so excited.
This was yesterday afternoon.


525
00:58:14.693 --> 00:58:19.026
Donnie said yes,
he wants to fund your guys'
movie, the whole bit.


526
00:58:20.485 --> 00:58:23.360
There's no way he
wouldn't have called you by now.


527
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:26.818
Damn it, Ed.

528
00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:31.860
It's Wren.

529
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:34.651
I knew it.
He's a fucking maniac.


530
00:58:38.151 --> 00:58:39.485
Oh, dear.

531
00:58:40.443 --> 00:58:42.443
What'd you guys
get yourselves into?


532
00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:43.818
I know.

533
00:58:47.235 --> 00:58:49.901
Wren told me
this cautionary tale.


534
00:58:51.401 --> 00:58:56.235
It alluded to the fact
that if I ever crossed him,
he would kill me.


535
00:58:58.193 --> 00:58:59.776
What are you going to do?

536
00:59:04.651 --> 00:59:05.735
Look...

537
00:59:07.526 --> 00:59:10.318
just keep calling Ed.

538
00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.443
Call Donnie, too.

539
00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:16.568
Tell him...

540
00:59:20.193 --> 00:59:22.860
I still want to make
the Retrovisionfilm.


541
00:59:26.276 --> 00:59:28.151
I'm ending this deal.

542
00:59:30.276 --> 00:59:32.401
One more thing...

543
00:59:32.443 --> 00:59:36.735
look up any shrinks
that might have gone missing...


544
00:59:36.776 --> 00:59:40.318
that they're in...
on a fishing trip.


545
00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.610
Okay.

546
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.651
Look, Archie.

547
00:59:46.026 --> 00:59:48.276
My dad, he's a big gun guy

548
00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:53.776
and he insists on me having
an arsenal just in case
the world ends.


549
00:59:55.276 --> 00:59:56.901
There's a gun in here.

550
01:00:00.235 --> 01:00:01.818
Just in case.

551
01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:39.818
Hey, Archie.
I got some news.


552
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:44.526
It seems that Dr. Fred Reed
recently died in a boating
accident while fishing.


553
01:00:48.151 --> 01:00:50.818
He threatened Fred to stop
treating Birdie's mental state,


554
01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.110
but she kept
having hallucinations of an
insect that spoke to her.


555
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:56.776
I'm only here for you to face
your fears, buddy,


556
01:00:56.818 --> 01:00:59.985
which happens to be death
and I get paid for it.


557
01:01:00.026 --> 01:01:02.901
My brother was very intrigued
by the case.


558
01:01:02.943 --> 01:01:05.610
He wanted to help her,
so he started treating her.


559
01:01:05.651 --> 01:01:10.151
How would you like,
I tell you a story to calm you
down before I fucking kill you.


560
01:01:10.193 --> 01:01:12.068
Wren, he put a stop to all that.

561
01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:14.776
He kept showing up at the
grocery store, the parking lot.


562
01:01:14.818 --> 01:01:19.568
That's the end of the story
except for the fact that
we got some boots for you.


563
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:21.651
We bought you boots.

564
01:01:21.693 --> 01:01:25.651
You're going to wear these boots
and you're going to go swimming.
Huh?


565
01:01:25.693 --> 01:01:27.985
He came in with a film script.

566
01:01:28.026 --> 01:01:32.026
It was entitled the
Dead Shrinkin bold font
right on the cover.


567
01:01:32.068 --> 01:01:33.818
He started reading it out loud

568
01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.818
and it was about
a corrupt psychiatrist


569
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.985
that was messing with the mind
of an innocent girl.


570
01:01:38.026 --> 01:01:41.610
You remember, when you were
a kid and you'd go to sleep


571
01:01:41.651 --> 01:01:43.735
and you thought there were
monsters under the bed.


572
01:01:43.776 --> 01:01:46.443
Well, there were.

573
01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:49.693
The last thing he said to my
brother before he left


574
01:01:49.735 --> 01:01:53.276
was don't steal
the little sheep from the wolf.


575
01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:56.110
He'll eat you.
He'll eat you real good.


576
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.443
Wren invited me.

577
01:02:07.026 --> 01:02:10.610
- Archie.
-Yeah, that's me.


578
01:02:10.651 --> 01:02:16.568
Welcome to my house of pain,
pleasure and whatever the hell
else Wren uses it for.


579
01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.818
Thanks for letting me in.

580
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.776
Hold on little, doggie.

581
01:02:20.818 --> 01:02:22.526
I'll let you in the doggy door,

582
01:02:22.568 --> 01:02:24.901
but, first,
I need to know one thing.


583
01:02:24.943 --> 01:02:28.610
How many years has that
stick been stuck up your ass?


584
01:02:32.985 --> 01:02:35.610
Relax, it's a party.

585
01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:38.276
It's downstairs.

586
01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:42.943
Sit down.

587
01:04:02.235 --> 01:04:07.068
Gentlemen, may I please
have everyone's attention.


588
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.651
I'm getting into
the movie business.


589
01:04:21.026 --> 01:04:27.693
Clap, clap,
clap your hands director.


590
01:04:27.735 --> 01:04:29.401
You are the artist.

591
01:04:29.443 --> 01:04:32.235
Clap for your future works.

592
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:37.693
Gentlemen, may I introduce
Archie Finch,


593
01:04:37.735 --> 01:04:43.735
director extraordinaire and his
leading lady, Birdie Anne.


594
01:04:47.526 --> 01:04:50.860
She will be the
Marilyn Monroe of our times.


595
01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.318
-Yes.
- How will this help
our cause?


596
01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:03.068
As all of us watchers here know
Hollywood is the great beast.


597
01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:06.485
Its tentacles reach the
farthest corners of the Earth,


598
01:05:06.526 --> 01:05:12.985
infecting the minds of the
simple, blinding the minds
of the sheeple, right?


599
01:05:13.026 --> 01:05:16.985
With their corrupt ideology,
morals, and ethics.


600
01:05:17.026 --> 01:05:24.526
So, we must blow up this beast,
slay this dragon.


601
01:05:24.568 --> 01:05:30.193
What better way to do it
than by infiltrating
its very castle walls.


602
01:05:30.235 --> 01:05:32.651
Secret societies control us
like puppets,


603
01:05:32.693 --> 01:05:39.401
treat us like cattle and in the
end, they sell us off to the
very devil himself.


604
01:05:40.443 --> 01:05:43.735
But Birdie Anne
will be our way in.


605
01:05:43.776 --> 01:05:49.401
She will sleep in their beds,
be our eyes and ears.


606
01:05:49.443 --> 01:05:52.026
Marilyn slept with J.F.K.

607
01:05:52.068 --> 01:05:57.485
Birdie Anne will fuck
all of Hollywood to death.


608
01:05:57.526 --> 01:05:58.901
What?

609
01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:03.485
Oh, babe.
Don't look that way.


610
01:06:04.443 --> 01:06:07.068
I know what that look is.

611
01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:09.610
It's the bugs on my face,
isn't it?


612
01:06:09.651 --> 01:06:13.151
Don't worry, they are harmless.

613
01:06:15.943 --> 01:06:19.735
The bug is talking to her again
in her head.


614
01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:25.651
Lately, it's been telling her
that we humans are all insects.


615
01:06:26.568 --> 01:06:28.401
Isn't that right, babe?

616
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.068
But we aren't insects.

617
01:06:32.985 --> 01:06:38.151
We're men and we
want pleasure from you.


618
01:06:39.151 --> 01:06:43.526
An insect couldn't get pleasure
from you, now, could it?


619
01:06:43.568 --> 01:06:46.860
Well, not the kind we seek.

620
01:06:51.026 --> 01:06:54.026
Gentlemen, have at our queen.

621
01:06:54.068 --> 01:06:58.318
She will feed her king
and her people.


622
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:04.026
Archie,
did you bring your camera?


623
01:07:06.068 --> 01:07:07.651
Push record.

624
01:07:39.151 --> 01:07:41.276
Get the fuck away from her.

625
01:07:46.526 --> 01:07:51.360
What? Whoa! What...
what's going on?


626
01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:54.693
Birdie, come on.
We have to leave now.


627
01:07:54.735 --> 01:07:56.318
I am free.

628
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.026
Where's Ed?

629
01:08:02.068 --> 01:08:05.901
Ed? What am I, his keeper?

630
01:08:05.943 --> 01:08:09.193
I don't babysit
overgrown douchebags, Archie.


631
01:08:09.235 --> 01:08:12.860
Now let's talk about this bad,
bad thing you just did.


632
01:08:19.693 --> 01:08:20.943
Don't you dare.

633
01:08:22.443 --> 01:08:25.110
Don't you even think
about taking my birdie.


634
01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:29.110
Put her back in her cage
where she belongs.


635
01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:37.151
For the love of... Oh, my God!

636
01:09:35.943 --> 01:09:37.610
Y'all have a good day.

637
01:09:59.193 --> 01:10:01.026
Hi, what can I get you two?

638
01:10:01.943 --> 01:10:03.985
Two evil olives, please.

639
01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:06.276
Coming right up.

640
01:10:30.901 --> 01:10:31.985
Ooh.

641
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.860
It is an evil olive, isn't it?

642
01:10:34.901 --> 01:10:37.235
Yeah, you're not kidding.

643
01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:38.943
Hardcore little dude.

644
01:10:40.735 --> 01:10:42.276
My best friend.

645
01:10:44.693 --> 01:10:49.735
She gives me sweet ignorance
for a minute, but it doesn't
last much longer than that.


646
01:10:50.735 --> 01:10:54.693
You could be anywhere
doing anything and just pop out
of nowhere.


647
01:10:55.568 --> 01:10:58.193
I have no control over my life
because of it.


648
01:11:02.568 --> 01:11:04.735
I don't even know who I am.

649
01:11:05.651 --> 01:11:09.943
Completely and utterly consumed
by this thing.


650
01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:17.276
I hear these voices in my head
giving me directions
and I have to follow them.


651
01:11:17.318 --> 01:11:19.360
It's like I don't have a choice.

652
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:28.026
The... the bug.

653
01:11:37.193 --> 01:11:40.026
He's right there.

654
01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.485
Make it go away.
Please make it go away.


655
01:11:55.276 --> 01:11:57.985
The mysterious ace card.

656
01:11:58.026 --> 01:12:04.735
Some people believe
that this card represents...
death.


657
01:12:04.776 --> 01:12:06.026
Hmm.

658
01:12:07.776 --> 01:12:10.193
-In the Vietnam War...

659
01:12:10.235 --> 01:12:15.193
...Americans would place
the ace card on enemy soldiers


660
01:12:15.235 --> 01:12:19.401
to have a psychological impact
when they found them.


661
01:12:19.443 --> 01:12:21.610
Hmm, riveting,

662
01:12:21.651 --> 01:12:25.193
but I must say, I think
my trophy will knock yours
out of the water.


663
01:12:25.235 --> 01:12:28.110
-Oh, really? Do tell.
-Okay.


664
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:33.110
Easy.

665
01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:38.276
What?
That was my joker face.


666
01:12:39.235 --> 01:12:41.901
-Well, it definitely
wasn't your poker face.


667
01:12:41.943 --> 01:12:44.610
That shit was
downright otherworldly.


668
01:12:45.526 --> 01:12:47.360
See, this is why
I should be famous.


669
01:12:47.401 --> 01:12:49.151
No CGI needed here.

670
01:12:59.193 --> 01:13:03.360
Anyways, the joker card
was first introduced in 1862


671
01:13:03.401 --> 01:13:06.735
and was actually first depicted
as a tiger.


672
01:13:06.776 --> 01:13:10.401
Really? Does that mean you
have a tiger face, too?


673
01:13:11.818 --> 01:13:14.943
-I don't know if you could
be trusted with that one yet.
-Oh, come on.


674
01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:19.943
Tell you what? I'll show you
mine if you show me yours.


675
01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.693
-Okay.

676
01:13:27.735 --> 01:13:29.693
In a show of solidarity,

677
01:13:31.235 --> 01:13:33.235
we'll raise our shot glasses,

678
01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:38.610
take a shot and then reveal
our finest tiger faces.


679
01:13:38.651 --> 01:13:39.735
Okay.

680
01:13:47.526 --> 01:13:49.776
All right.
Ready when you are.


681
01:14:43.068 --> 01:14:45.860
Has your monkey won any?

682
01:14:50.026 --> 01:14:52.110
Hey, Archie.

683
01:14:52.151 --> 01:14:56.485
I know it's been a week,
but I'm so shaken up
over the whole thing.


684
01:14:56.526 --> 01:15:01.401
I mean if you hadn't been there,
I don't know what would have
happened.


685
01:15:07.193 --> 01:15:08.985
I know it's what I had to do.

686
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:14.735
Why do you have to leave?

687
01:15:19.026 --> 01:15:20.693
Ed's my best friend.

688
01:15:22.735 --> 01:15:24.068
I understand.

689
01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:33.901
Go to the hotel.

690
01:15:33.943 --> 01:15:35.985
It's probably the safest place.

691
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.901
Are you sure
the hotel is the safest place?


692
01:15:40.818 --> 01:15:42.860
That place gives me the creeps.

693
01:15:48.068 --> 01:15:50.151
I have to do
some detective stuff.


694
01:15:53.443 --> 01:15:55.776
-Batman shit.

695
01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:58.360
Well then, you need a Robin?

696
01:16:01.735 --> 01:16:04.151
Just promise me you'll be safe.

697
01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:08.818
When all this blows over...

698
01:16:10.318 --> 01:16:12.068
when everything's figured out...

699
01:16:13.818 --> 01:16:16.610
we'll go to a beach
of your choice.


700
01:16:16.651 --> 01:16:19.443
-I like that idea.
-Get Mai Tais.


701
01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.818
I want you two
to get into her room.


702
01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.818
Once you have her secured, bring
in the rest of the ghouls

703
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:42.651
and make sure before you kill her, to bathe
her in that gallon of pig blood I gave you.

704
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:52.401
No, no, no, no, no please, no.

705
01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.693
No, no, no, no. Please, no.

706
01:17:19.485 --> 01:17:22.776
No, no, no, no.

707
01:17:59.943 --> 01:18:04.985
Film it. Film it all.
She's going to be
a star after all.


708
01:18:05.026 --> 01:18:07.860
And as for Archie, don't worry.

709
01:18:07.901 --> 01:18:09.901
I sent a snake after him.

710
01:18:11.193 --> 01:18:14.776
Today will still be beautiful.

711
01:18:31.276 --> 01:18:33.901
Ed, man. Where are you?

712
01:18:46.651 --> 01:18:52.443
I'm super excited
about this investor.
Let's make Retrovision.


713
01:18:52.485 --> 01:18:56.526
You're my guy.
Yeah, get back to me.


714
01:18:57.401 --> 01:18:59.235
Text me or something.

715
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:14.693
-Mary, how are you sweetie?
-I'm good.


716
01:19:14.735 --> 01:19:17.693
I'm just coming
to check on Archie.


717
01:19:17.735 --> 01:19:22.068
That's what I figured
'cause ain't nobody want to
visit an aging bat like me


718
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:24.110
-that's for damn sure.

719
01:19:24.151 --> 01:19:26.901
Um, how's his
physical therapy going?


720
01:19:26.943 --> 01:19:30.526
Good. Real good.
He's starting to remember
little things here and there.


721
01:19:30.568 --> 01:19:32.068
He's in his room.

722
01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.485
So how's your memory?

723
01:19:43.526 --> 01:19:46.026
Remember anything new?

724
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:59.818
Hey, it'll...
it'll come back to you.


725
01:20:25.318 --> 01:20:27.568
Archie, you scared me.

726
01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:30.401
I thought you
were the living dead.


727
01:20:30.443 --> 01:20:33.193
You need a shower.
You're bringing in the flies.


728
01:20:33.235 --> 01:20:35.026
They gravitate towards...

729
01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.651
Well, it's obvious
you ain't hearing me.


730
01:20:38.693 --> 01:20:41.318
Looks like I'm going to have
to spray you down with Febreze.


731
01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.193
I'm left no choice.

732
01:20:45.526 --> 01:20:48.026
You have dad's belt buckle?

733
01:20:49.151 --> 01:20:50.943
I've been saving it for you.

734
01:20:50.985 --> 01:20:53.526
Now, you're not
going to sell it, are you?


735
01:20:53.568 --> 01:20:57.568
Because if that's the case,
I'm going to just keep it here
where it's nice and safe.


736
01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.901
I'm not going to sell it.

737
01:21:01.943 --> 01:21:04.151
Okay, but I'm trusting you.

738
01:21:34.985 --> 01:21:38.735
Retrovision, hey.
What's that about?


739
01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:44.151
Let me guess.
How we should learn
from our past mistakes.


740
01:21:44.193 --> 01:21:46.776
Chicken crap.
Give me that.


741
01:21:47.776 --> 01:21:51.818
No good alligator hugging,
cow tipping, donkey ride.


742
01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.068
Who do you think you are?
Horseshit.


743
01:22:00.276 --> 01:22:01.318
Hey, Archie.

744
01:22:02.526 --> 01:22:04.401
Don't listen to that man.

745
01:22:04.443 --> 01:22:09.401
This script is going to make for
a fine movie one day.


746
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.110
Hey, what you doing
with that mannequin.


747
01:23:34.151 --> 01:23:36.985
Hey, look, the yard sale
was over yesterday, buddy.


748
01:23:37.026 --> 01:23:39.735
Hey, come back here.
I want money for that.
I want money.


749
01:23:39.776 --> 01:23:43.568
Come back here.
Come back here.


750
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:48.610
What else did he take?

751
01:24:06.943 --> 01:24:11.568
Look at dreams. I can't stay.

752
01:25:16.443 --> 01:25:18.860
Open your mind.

753
01:25:57.193 --> 01:26:00.235
Allow me to introduce myself.

754
01:26:00.276 --> 01:26:05.443
I am a Psychopomp
starring as Retrovision,


755
01:26:05.485 --> 01:26:09.818
the title and character from a
script you wrote while on Earth.


756
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:15.693
Me and my cast reenacted
elements and people
from your past life


757
01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:21.110
in order to wake you up
from your false belief
that you were alive.


758
01:26:21.151 --> 01:26:25.485
This here is not a
physical plane as it seems.


759
01:26:25.526 --> 01:26:31.026
These are ghost sets of actual
places you had been to on Earth.


760
01:26:31.068 --> 01:26:36.068
One of my best actors playing
your friend Birdie Anne


761
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:40.776
triggered a memory
which resulted
in you realizing the truth.


762
01:26:40.818 --> 01:26:47.485
This gave us the right
to guide you to your final
destination in the afterlife,


763
01:26:47.526 --> 01:26:53.110
but we weren't the only ones
that were trying to pull you out
of this time loop.


764
01:26:53.151 --> 01:26:56.776
Dark insects had assembled
their own cast,


765
01:26:56.818 --> 01:27:01.568
but with the intention
of taking you to the dark place.


766
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:05.735
But now that you know the truth
you must leave.


767
01:27:05.776 --> 01:27:09.651
The insects are crafty
and could still trick you.


768
01:27:09.693 --> 01:27:12.485
This motel door
is really a gate.


769
01:27:12.526 --> 01:27:14.568
You must walk through it.

770
01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:18.693
Do it now
before the loop closes.


771
01:27:35.276 --> 01:27:38.568
Job well done.

772
01:27:49.943 --> 01:27:53.068
What do you want
our story to be now, Birdie?
