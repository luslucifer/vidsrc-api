- Uh, that'll be Rebel Rouser.

958
00:39:24.249 --> 00:39:27.804
Don't let the good
looks fool you, homie.


959
00:39:27.804 --> 00:39:28.874
- Next!

[Rebel laughs]
Come on, girl.


961
00:39:30.082 --> 00:39:31.014
- That's...

962
00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:40.989
- Woo-hoo, man, what's up, dog?

963
00:39:40.989 --> 00:39:43.475
Oh, you got your new
lifeguard uniform on, hmm?


964
00:39:43.475 --> 00:39:45.166
Lookin' spiffy there, man.

965
00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:46.892
- Apparently, it
ain't that spiffy.


966
00:39:46.892 --> 00:39:50.137
I mean, hell, females
still ignore me.


967
00:39:50.137 --> 00:39:52.622
Man, I thought once
I became a lifeguard


968
00:39:52.622 --> 00:39:53.623
that females would like me.

969

I'd become cool.

970

I'd be the man.

971
00:39:56.557 --> 00:39:59.007
- Look, man, I'm
a reformed player.


972
00:39:59.007 --> 00:40:00.423
I could tell you one
of the golden rules


973
00:40:00.423 --> 00:40:02.287
about being a player, baby.

974

A man always want to put his
hand inside a woman pants,


975
00:40:05.048 --> 00:40:08.465
but a woman always want to put
her hand inside a man pocket.

Do you see what I'm sayin'?

977

- I don't get it.

978
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.091
- Man, act like you got cash,

979
00:40:14.091 --> 00:40:16.059
and you more liable
to get the ass.


980
00:40:16.059 --> 00:40:17.923
- I don't have any cash.

981
00:40:17.923 --> 00:40:21.409
- Fake it till you
make it, player!


982
00:40:21.409 --> 00:40:25.172
Man, never mind, oh,
would you look at that.


983
00:40:25.172 --> 00:40:26.000
A'ight.

984
00:40:31.108 --> 00:40:32.765
- What you, what you doin'?

985
00:40:32.765 --> 00:40:34.733
- It's called minding
my own business.


986
00:40:34.733 --> 00:40:36.666
You should try it sometime.

987
00:40:36.666 --> 00:40:38.461
- Look, Tomasina.

988
00:40:38.461 --> 00:40:39.807
- Tommy.

989
00:40:39.807 --> 00:40:41.567
- Okay, Tommy, I ain't
been nothin' but cool


990
00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:43.707

I met you yesterday.

But you keep being
all saditty and stank.

That's it.

993
00:40:47.642 --> 00:40:48.919
I ain't being cool
with you no more.

yeah, you want to take, like,
maybe take a little time,

That's a, you know, I'm
rushin' you, you know.

How you doing?

I drive a Benz.

is, it's like,


1025

I'm cool with most of the
people in the industry already,

You know, it's like
Master P, Russell Simmons.

You know what I'm saying?

00:43:07.437 --> 00:43:10.164
Me and E-40, we
like brothers, shit.


1033

- Hmm, you'll have
to introduce me.

This is how I can make some cash

to enter into the Boogie
Beach Bash mixed CD contest.

And I'd have some

to go up into the studio.

- How?

1043
00:43:33.221 --> 00:43:35.223
- By catching this Beach Bandit.

- You're not gonna
catch the Beach Bandit.

We'll see who catch
the Beach Bandit

and come up on some money.

May the sexiest person win.

You didn't get the babe, because
you're not flashy enough.

is get some ice, ese.

You need to get the

Besides, he pays
for the beach house,


2089
01:26:14.332 --> 01:26:17.922

is pay my own tuition.
