1
00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:29.374
- Hey, Liv.

2
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.710
<i>
- Hi, Mom.</i>

3
00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:33.937
- You okay?

4
00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:35.622
<i>- Mom, I have something bad
to tell you,</i>


5
00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:36.882
<i>but don't freak out.</i>

6
00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:17.497
- Eric?

7
00:01:21.262 --> 00:01:23.169
Liv has news.

8
00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:25.155
- Good or bad?

9
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.844
Hi, hon, everything okay?

10
00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:32.437
<i>
- Hey, Dad.</i>

11
00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:36.016
Everything's okay.
It's just, Sam and I broke up.


12
00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:37.667
<i>So the only reason
I'm telling you and Mom</i>


13
00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:39.169
<i>is 'cause I'm moving.</i>

14
00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:42.172
- So you're coming home.
That's wonderful.


15
00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:44.783
I mean, I'm sorry
about you and Sam.


16
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.768
<i>It's just,</i>

17
00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:50.347
now at least you can really
concentrate on grad school.


18
00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:51.848
Speaking of which,
how is that going?


19
00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:54.017
- Dad, I'm not coming home.

20
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.109
I'm just gonna stay
with a friend


21
00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:56.628
until I can find my own place.

22
00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:57.704
- Oh.

23
00:01:57.798 --> 00:01:58.946
<i>
- I'm sorry.</i>

24
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.465
I already told Mom that,
you know,


25
00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:03.360
your house is way too far
from work and school.


26
00:02:03.378 --> 00:02:04.694
<i>And you know, I have a really
demanding lab at 8:00 a.m.</i>


27
00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:06.305
<i>in the morning,
and there's no way</i>


28
00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:07.622
<i>that I could go there
and back three times a week.</i>


29
00:02:07.716 --> 00:02:10.142
- I understand.

30
00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.311
It's just,
we miss seeing you around here.


31
00:02:14.373 --> 00:02:15.814
Olivia.

32
00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:20.986
<i>
- Dad?</i>

33
00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:26.808
Dad?

34
00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:28.902
Dad, you still there?

35
00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:31.646
- Yeah, I'm here.

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.332
I just want you to know
I love you.


37
00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:37.911
- I do know.
I love you too.


38
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:43.567
Are you okay?
Is Mom okay?


39
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.086
- Don't worry about us.
All right?


40
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.922
You have enough on your plate.

41
00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:52.166
- Well, how about
I come over next weekend?


42
00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:53.668
Maybe we could do Sunday dinner?

43
00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:55.354
- That sounds good.

44
00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:58.932
- Okay, well,
I'll talk to you later.


45
00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:00.192
<i>
- Bye, hon.</i>

46
00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:32.891
- I'm not surprised.
Are you?


47
00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:34.801
- What?

48
00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:37.062
- I never thought he was the
right person for Liv anyway.


49
00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:39.231
I think it's for the best.

50
00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:41.400
- Right.

51
00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:43.384
Are you going out?

52
00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:46.387
- Yes, I told you I'm going
to dinner with Agnes.


53
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.222
You can join us if you want.

54
00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:50.133
- No, you go ahead.

55
00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:54.162
I have some accounts
I have to go over for tomorrow.


56
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:58.825
- You work too hard, honey.
- I'm working on it.


57
00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:04.330
- Have fun.

58
00:04:04.483 --> 00:04:06.508
- Okay.

59
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:56.641
- Rebecca?

60
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.554
- Ready, Mom?

61
00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:51.399
I know it's gonna be strange
without Dad.


62
00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:57.989
- I've been staying with Agnes.
I haven't been back home.


63
00:07:58.216 --> 00:07:59.399
- Oh.

64
00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:05.221
I'm sorry I didn't come home
when it first happened.


65
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.741
It's just, I didn't know if
I'd be able to handle all this,


66
00:08:08.894 --> 00:08:11.244
but I've taken a leave
of absence


67
00:08:11.338 --> 00:08:14.414
from my graduate program,
and work gave me time off,


68
00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:18.843
so I'll be able to stay here
as long as you need me to.


69
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.014
- It's not just your father
being gone, Olivia.


70
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.016
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,


71
00:08:25.168 --> 00:08:30.021
but I think
the house is haunted.


72
00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:32.415
- What do you mean haunted?
Like, by Dad?


73
00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:33.858
- I don't know.

74
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:39.439
But something
isn't right in there, Liv.


75
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.462
- Hi, come on in.
- Thank you, Agnes.


76
00:10:17.613 --> 00:10:20.523
- Sure.
Join us for some tea?


77
00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:22.801
- Yeah, that sounds nice.

78
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.867
- I didn't mean to upset you
with what I said earlier.


79
00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:33.202
It's just that...

80
00:10:34.648 --> 00:10:38.483
With everything that's happened,

81
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.894
going back to that house alone
was too much.


82
00:10:41.988 --> 00:10:43.971
- No, it's all right.

83
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.885
You know, walking around
the house did feel strange,


84
00:10:48.978 --> 00:10:51.663
knowing that Dad's
not coming back.


85
00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:54.740
I mean, there's just
so many memories in there,


86
00:10:54.835 --> 00:10:56.483
like that one Christmas.

87
00:10:56.578 --> 00:10:58.411
I think I was like seven,

88
00:10:58.505 --> 00:11:00.338
and I was so convinced
Santa was not real.


89
00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:02.415
Remember that?
- Yeah.


90
00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:04.676
- And yet, Dad came
into the living room


91
00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:08.087
dressed up as Santa Claus,
and he was so into it,


92
00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:12.241
so, like, I had to play along.
I don't know.


93
00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:14.668
I just think
by the end of the night,


94
00:11:14.762 --> 00:11:16.688
I started to believe
in Santa again.


95
00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:22.527
- He loved you so much.

96
00:11:26.257 --> 00:11:27.365
He loved that house.

97
00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:29.868
- Thank you.

98
00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:32.686
- You know, that house has been
in Eric's family


99
00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:34.021
for three generations.

100
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.207
- Right.

101
00:11:36.434 --> 00:11:38.451
- His grandfather bought it
for his grandmother


102
00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:41.880
when they got married.

103
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:43.715
It was a rooming house at first,

104
00:11:43.866 --> 00:11:48.702
but then they decided
to have their own family.


105
00:11:48.722 --> 00:11:52.724
It was so sentimental to Eric,

106
00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:58.062
but to me, I just
never felt comfortable there.


107
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.048
- Mom, is that true?

108
00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:06.387
- Well, it's just so big.

109
00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:09.799
Like, you know, swallows you up.

110
00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:12.577
I used to have
this dream of us moving


111
00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:16.748
and making a new beginning

112
00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:19.733
without the history
of his family,


113
00:12:19.753 --> 00:12:22.403
like, hanging over us.

114
00:12:22.497 --> 00:12:24.738
- You can do that now, Rebecca.

115
00:12:24.758 --> 00:12:27.592
- Wait, Mom, you're talking
about selling the house?


116
00:12:27.743 --> 00:12:29.502
- It might be a good time.

117
00:12:29.654 --> 00:12:31.003
From what I've read,

118
00:12:31.156 --> 00:12:33.322
the real estate market
is really hot right now.


119
00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:35.934
- I don't think we should
talk about that today.


120
00:12:36.085 --> 00:12:39.495
- Okay, but why are you
even talking about selling it?


121
00:12:39.588 --> 00:12:41.272
- Did you tell her
about the thing?


122
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:46.686
- What thing?

123
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.763
- Strange happenings.

124
00:12:49.783 --> 00:12:52.842
Well, the night
that your father...


125
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.768
The night that it happened,

126
00:12:54.862 --> 00:12:58.181
your mother came back from the
hospital, exhausted, of course.


127
00:12:58.274 --> 00:13:00.458
She was getting ready
for bed when...


128
00:13:00.609 --> 00:13:03.536
- I was getting undressed,

129
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.779
and I heard these noises

130
00:13:05.873 --> 00:13:08.633
in the hallway.

131
00:13:08.784 --> 00:13:12.378
It sounded like footsteps.

132
00:13:12.472 --> 00:13:15.622
And then it sounded like they
were going down the stairs.


133
00:13:15.642 --> 00:13:17.533
I froze.

134
00:13:17.552 --> 00:13:20.794
I wanted to go see what it was,

135
00:13:20.888 --> 00:13:24.557
but all I could do
was run to Agnes'.


136
00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:27.468
- She was at the door
not 30 seconds later.


137
00:13:27.487 --> 00:13:29.395
And while
we were talking outside...


138
00:13:31.974 --> 00:13:34.975
<i>And then the lights
just went off.</i>


139
00:13:34.995 --> 00:13:36.736
I saw it, too.

140
00:13:36.888 --> 00:13:40.832
- I've stayed here
ever since then.


141
00:13:40.983 --> 00:13:42.742
- But it's good
that you're here now.


142
00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:46.412
Maybe you can help get
to the bottom of all of this.


143
00:13:54.848 --> 00:13:56.663
- Where are you going?

144
00:13:56.758 --> 00:13:58.665
- I'm just so tired.

145
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.093
So I'm just gonna go home.
You can definitely stay here.


146
00:14:01.246 --> 00:14:05.598
It's just...I think Dad would've
wanted us to be together.


147
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.281
- Oh, sweetheart.

148
00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:32.775
<i>- Police are looking
for this man after he was seen</i>


149
00:14:32.794 --> 00:14:34.777
<i>breaking into
a local office building.</i>


150
00:14:34.796 --> 00:14:36.721
<i>When police tried
to apprehend the man,</i>


151
00:14:36.872 --> 00:14:38.614
<i>he assaulted
the officers and ran.</i>


152
00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:39.724
<i>They're looking for...</i>

153
00:15:04.992 --> 00:15:06.492
- Good morning!

154
00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:08.569
How did everything
go last night?


155
00:15:08.588 --> 00:15:10.404
Any new developments?

156
00:15:10.423 --> 00:15:12.148
- Everything's fine.
Everything's the same.


157
00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:14.908
- Well, just don't let
your guard down.


158
00:15:15.002 --> 00:15:16.502
From what I've read online,

159
00:15:16.596 --> 00:15:20.339
your next step would be
to sage all the rooms.


160
00:15:20.433 --> 00:15:22.433
I happened to pick up a jar
when I was at the supermarket.


161
00:15:22.585 --> 00:15:23.935
I can go get it.

162
00:15:24.162 --> 00:15:26.437
- I think it's a different
kind of sage.


163
00:15:26.664 --> 00:15:28.088
- Oh.

164
00:15:59.455 --> 00:16:00.805
- Rebecca!

165
00:16:06.462 --> 00:16:07.645
- Mom, what's wrong?
What's wrong?


166
00:16:07.872 --> 00:16:08.962
What happened, what happened,
what happened?


167
00:16:08.982 --> 00:16:10.373
- Should I call 911?
- It was him.


168
00:16:10.466 --> 00:16:11.983
He called me.
- What?


169
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.152
- It was Eric.
He called me on the phone.


170
00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:15.895
- Mom, no, no, no, no, no.
- It was Eric.


171
00:16:15.989 --> 00:16:17.730
- Shh, it's okay.

172
00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:19.882
- What if he's trying to
reach me from the other side?


173
00:16:19.901 --> 00:16:20.992
What if he's suffering?

174
00:16:21.143 --> 00:16:22.551
- Sweetie, no, no.

175
00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:25.388
- I'm sorry, but,
Mom, it's not Dad.


176
00:16:25.406 --> 00:16:27.072
It's just someone's idea
of a sick prank.


177
00:16:27.225 --> 00:16:28.815
- No, no.

178
00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:30.075
- Where's Dad's phone?

179
00:16:30.228 --> 00:16:32.670
Did you get it
from the hospital?


180
00:16:32.897 --> 00:16:35.898
- It wasn't on him
when they brought him in.


181
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:37.583
I have looked
all over this house,


182
00:16:37.677 --> 00:16:39.326
and I cannot find it.

183
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.512
- Okay, okay.
All right, it's okay.


184
00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:45.591
<i>- Hi, you've reached
Eric Garland.</i>


185
00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:47.076
<i>Please leave a message,</i>

186
00:16:47.094 --> 00:16:47.927
<i>and I'll be sure
to call you right back.</i>


187
00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.855
- It's him.

188
00:16:51.082 --> 00:16:52.356
- There's a perfectly
reasonable explanation


189
00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:53.749
for this.

190
00:16:53.768 --> 00:16:55.509
- It was him.
He called me.


191
00:16:55.528 --> 00:16:57.028
- You know what?

192
00:16:57.179 --> 00:16:59.012
I was about
to make a cup of tea.


193
00:16:59.106 --> 00:17:00.531
Why don't you join me, Rebecca?

194
00:17:08.783 --> 00:17:10.041
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


195
00:17:10.268 --> 00:17:11.784
- Thank you.

196
00:17:51.309 --> 00:17:55.044
- Hey, Mom, so the store
was super crowded today.


197
00:17:57.815 --> 00:17:59.924
Turns out there was a sale
on beef brisket,


198
00:18:00.075 --> 00:18:01.259
and I bought some.

199
00:18:03.671 --> 00:18:05.671
Mom?

200
00:18:05.823 --> 00:18:07.348
- Yes, yes.

201
00:18:12.163 --> 00:18:14.421
- Tomorrow I'm gonna
go to Dad's office.


202
00:18:14.515 --> 00:18:16.423
We should get all the things
in order,


203
00:18:16.517 --> 00:18:18.276
clear all the accounts.

204
00:18:19.612 --> 00:18:21.862
- Whatever you think is best,
sweetheart.


205
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.574
I'm gonna go lie down.

206
00:18:38.798 --> 00:18:40.798
- Dinner's ready!

207
00:18:45.863 --> 00:18:47.471
Mom?

208
00:18:53.721 --> 00:18:55.438
Dinner's ready!

209
00:19:15.242 --> 00:19:18.502
Hey, Mom, dinner's ready.

210
00:19:18.654 --> 00:19:21.505
- I'm not hungry now,
sweetheart.


211
00:19:21.732 --> 00:19:24.233
Go ahead.

212
00:19:24.251 --> 00:19:28.512
- What's all this, Dad's stuff?
Where you taking it?


213
00:19:28.664 --> 00:19:33.184
- I need to keep it pristine,
like he would have liked.


214
00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:35.019
- Yeah.

215
00:19:35.246 --> 00:19:37.021
- This...

216
00:19:37.248 --> 00:19:39.023
This one...

217
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:45.679
This was one of his favorites.

218
00:19:45.698 --> 00:19:48.924
He looked so handsome in this.

219
00:19:48.943 --> 00:19:50.684
- He only looked so handsome

220
00:19:50.778 --> 00:19:53.204
'cause you picked out
all his clothes.


221
00:19:53.355 --> 00:19:55.781
- You know, your father
was very fashionable.


222
00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:57.933
- Mm.

223
00:19:57.952 --> 00:20:01.545
- That's what caught my eye
the first time I met him.


224
00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:03.547
- When you were talking
about selling the house


225
00:20:03.699 --> 00:20:06.032
the other day,
were you being serious?


226
00:20:06.127 --> 00:20:08.052
- We don't have to talk
about that now, sweetheart.


227
00:20:08.203 --> 00:20:09.612
- I know.
You keep saying that, though.


228
00:20:09.705 --> 00:20:11.630
But I just really wanna know.

229
00:20:11.724 --> 00:20:13.391
- Yes.

230
00:20:15.395 --> 00:20:17.970
Without your Dad here,

231
00:20:18.122 --> 00:20:22.141
this house is just way too much
for me to handle by myself.


232
00:20:22.293 --> 00:20:24.568
- But you're not alone.
I'm here.


233
00:20:24.795 --> 00:20:27.387
- Sooner or later,
you're going to need to leave,


234
00:20:27.407 --> 00:20:29.222
as you should.

235
00:20:29.316 --> 00:20:31.575
You have to live your life.

236
00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:34.060
- Yes, but not if it means
losing this place.


237
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.579
This is my home.

238
00:20:35.731 --> 00:20:37.081
- I think it's time
for a change.


239
00:20:37.232 --> 00:20:39.308
I think it would be good for us.

240
00:20:40.478 --> 00:20:41.810
For me.

241
00:20:41.904 --> 00:20:43.495
- Dad hasn't even
been gone a week,


242
00:20:43.589 --> 00:20:45.405
and you're already packing up
all his things,


243
00:20:45.499 --> 00:20:47.166
and I just don't want you
to make any rash decisions.


244
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.670
- You have no idea what it's
like for me in this house.


245
00:20:51.764 --> 00:20:56.583
I feel like I'm being watched,
like I'm trapped.


246
00:20:56.602 --> 00:20:57.676
- Mom.

247
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.662
- I'm hearing things,

248
00:20:59.755 --> 00:21:02.498
noises all over the house
in the night.


249
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:06.335
I can barely bring myself
to sleep in this room.


250
00:21:06.428 --> 00:21:08.170
- It's just probably
the grief talking,


251
00:21:08.263 --> 00:21:10.114
and that's totally
understandable.


252
00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:15.527
Maybe you should go to therapy.

253
00:21:15.621 --> 00:21:17.846
We should go to therapy.

254
00:21:17.865 --> 00:21:22.685
- I don't need therapy, Olivia.

255
00:21:22.703 --> 00:21:25.129
I need to move.

256
00:21:53.567 --> 00:21:55.234
- I'm glad you're here.

257
00:21:55.328 --> 00:21:56.660
I've been waiting for someone

258
00:21:56.887 --> 00:21:58.721
to tell me what to do
with Mr. Garland's things.


259
00:21:58.814 --> 00:22:00.998
Everything is exactly
how he left it.


260
00:22:03.394 --> 00:22:05.318
- What happened to Nancy?

261
00:22:05.412 --> 00:22:07.246
- Was she the old assistant?

262
00:22:07.398 --> 00:22:09.173
I've only been here three weeks.

263
00:22:09.324 --> 00:22:11.967
It's been kind of overwhelming,
to be honest.


264
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.161
You wanted the client files?

265
00:22:15.256 --> 00:22:16.597
- Yeah, I know where they are.
- Oh.


266
00:22:26.174 --> 00:22:28.008
- Garland Investment Services.

267
00:22:28.102 --> 00:22:29.418
<i>
- Put me on the phone with Eric.</i>

268
00:22:29.436 --> 00:22:31.270
- I'm sorry, Mrs. McCabe.

269
00:22:31.364 --> 00:22:34.514
I'm sure you heard that
Mr. Garland recently passed.


270
00:22:34.608 --> 00:22:36.258
<i>
- Nobody's returning my calls.</i>

271
00:22:36.277 --> 00:22:38.093
- I know.
It's not an excuse.


272
00:22:38.112 --> 00:22:40.596
But if you'll just bear with us
while we figure things out...


273
00:22:40.614 --> 00:22:43.115
<i>- Bear with you?
Who's in charge there?</i>


274
00:22:43.267 --> 00:22:45.025
<i>I demand
they close my account at once,</i>


275
00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:46.627
<i>or I am calling my lawyer.</i>

276
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.547
- Hi, Mrs. McCabe.

277
00:22:49.698 --> 00:22:52.032
This is Olivia Garland,
Eric Garland's daughter.


278
00:22:52.126 --> 00:22:55.035
<i>- I hope that you can tell me
just what the hell is going on</i>


279
00:22:55.054 --> 00:22:57.129
<i>with the balance in my
personal retirement account.</i>


280
00:22:57.223 --> 00:22:58.889
- Yes, yes, I can assure you
that I'm going through


281
00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:00.799
all my father's accounts
as we speak.


282
00:23:00.893 --> 00:23:02.726
And as soon as I have
all the information that I need


283
00:23:02.878 --> 00:23:04.953
to sit down with you,
I will be in touch, okay?


284
00:23:05.047 --> 00:23:06.564
<i>
- I'm not holding my breath.</i>

285
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.567
- There have been
calls like that


286
00:23:09.718 --> 00:23:11.460
ever since I started here.

287
00:23:11.553 --> 00:23:13.720
One angry guy
called, like, 20 times.


288
00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:15.464
Mr. Garland told me
to let him handle it.


289
00:23:15.482 --> 00:23:17.908
But now that he's gone,
I haven't known what to say.


290
00:23:19.895 --> 00:23:22.228
- Did you ever hear what
my father said to those people?


291
00:23:22.323 --> 00:23:24.915
- No, he always
kept the door shut.


292
00:23:29.163 --> 00:23:31.255
I didn't know Mr. Garland well,

293
00:23:31.482 --> 00:23:32.906
but I could tell something
was troubling him,


294
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.167
especially those last few days.

295
00:23:37.763 --> 00:23:40.656
I think there might've been
some financial issues.


296
00:24:27.462 --> 00:24:29.221
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Are you okay?


297
00:24:29.315 --> 00:24:31.039
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

298
00:24:31.058 --> 00:24:34.652
- Ah, you know what?
No permanent damage done.


299
00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:36.636
- Permanent?
Okay, what about temporary?


300
00:24:36.656 --> 00:24:38.656
- Hold on, time out.
That...


301
00:24:38.807 --> 00:24:39.731
- You know, whatever it is,
I'm gonna take care of it.


302
00:24:39.884 --> 00:24:42.142
- Sorry, that was
such a lame joke.


303
00:24:42.236 --> 00:24:44.328
I'm okay.
I'm totally fine.


304
00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:46.388
- Yeah...I'm sorry.

305
00:24:46.407 --> 00:24:47.572
You do not need to be
apologizing to me.


306
00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:49.408
I'm just...I'm a mess,

307
00:24:49.502 --> 00:24:51.410
and I shouldn't
even be driving right now.


308
00:24:51.562 --> 00:24:55.230
- Oh, well, then maybe it's me
who should ask, are you okay?


309
00:24:55.249 --> 00:24:56.340
- Yeah, there has been
a lot going on, but...


310
00:24:56.567 --> 00:24:58.066
- You look...

311
00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.418
But that's not an excuse.

312
00:24:59.512 --> 00:25:00.994
Sorry.

313
00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:03.405
- Where you headed right now?

314
00:25:03.498 --> 00:25:05.165
- I think the universe is
telling me to go home,


315
00:25:05.184 --> 00:25:09.761
so message has been received.

316
00:25:09.914 --> 00:25:12.097
- I'm going to that coffee shop
right down there.


317
00:25:12.191 --> 00:25:14.917
- Can I give you a ride?
That's the least that I can do.


318
00:25:14.935 --> 00:25:16.694
- Well, maybe you can
just join me.


319
00:25:16.921 --> 00:25:19.530
Kind of look like you use
a coffee break.


320
00:25:19.757 --> 00:25:23.258
And you did just hit me
with your car, so I don't know.


321
00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:26.704
- Oh, so you're gonna milk it?

322
00:25:26.931 --> 00:25:28.521
- Yeah.

323
00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:30.449
- Yeah, okay.

324
00:25:30.543 --> 00:25:33.544
- I got the first round though.
I'm Jake, by the way.


325
00:25:33.695 --> 00:25:36.863
- Olivia Garland, and I think I
should be buying you a coffee.


326
00:25:36.957 --> 00:25:38.123
- You get the second round.

327
00:25:38.275 --> 00:25:39.717
- There's a second round?
- Mm-hmm.


328
00:25:39.868 --> 00:25:41.460
I'll tell you what,
you park your car.


329
00:25:41.554 --> 00:25:42.945
I'm gonna go over there
and grab a couple of coffees.


330
00:25:42.963 --> 00:25:45.723
Meet me over there, okay?

331
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.632
Chai latte?

332
00:25:47.727 --> 00:25:49.393
- Ah, so you are good.

333
00:25:51.805 --> 00:25:53.897
Wait, you don't want a ride?

334
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:56.549
- You know,
given our brief history,


335
00:25:56.569 --> 00:25:58.885
I feel like it might be
a little safer on these guys.


336
00:25:58.904 --> 00:26:00.738
- That's fair.

337
00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:02.647
- I'm just kidding.
I'll see you there.


338
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.241
- Okay.

339
00:26:13.753 --> 00:26:15.327
- That's a pretty heavy deal.

340
00:26:15.421 --> 00:26:17.496
I'm sorry.

341
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.074
- Yeah, it's just, you know,
everything turned upside down.


342
00:26:21.168 --> 00:26:22.985
I mean,
it only happened last week,


343
00:26:23.078 --> 00:26:25.763
so I'm just...I'm
a little raw still.


344
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.840
- Yeah, well,
that's totally understandable.


345
00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:31.251
I'm really sorry
about your dad, by the way.


346
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.846
- Thank you.
I'm just worried about my mom.


347
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.349
You know, I thought it'd be
a good idea to come home


348
00:26:37.443 --> 00:26:41.520
so that we can grieve together,
but now I'm not so sure.


349
00:26:41.614 --> 00:26:43.188
- Well, I bet you're doing
way more than you realize


350
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.099
just by being there.

351
00:26:46.193 --> 00:26:47.451
How long were
your parents together?


352
00:26:47.678 --> 00:26:50.621
- 25 years.

353
00:26:50.772 --> 00:26:53.031
- Yeah, I bet that's quite
the adjustment, huh?


354
00:26:53.183 --> 00:26:54.941
- I know.

355
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.853
It's just, you know,
I wish I could help her more.


356
00:26:57.946 --> 00:27:00.188
- Take it easy on yourself,
okay?


357
00:27:00.207 --> 00:27:01.540
You're grieving
your own loss, too.


358
00:27:01.634 --> 00:27:03.542
Don't forget it.

359
00:27:05.546 --> 00:27:07.805
You know, you might be
the unluckiest person in town.


360
00:27:07.956 --> 00:27:09.364
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.


361
00:27:09.383 --> 00:27:11.867
First, I almost hit you
with my car,


362
00:27:11.885 --> 00:27:15.370
and then I'm venting to you
like you're my therapist.


363
00:27:15.463 --> 00:27:17.889
- Well, I am
kind of a therapist.


364
00:27:18.042 --> 00:27:19.483
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


365
00:27:22.988 --> 00:27:27.065
Jake Winters,
physical therapist.


366
00:27:27.217 --> 00:27:30.994
- You know, I've seen a few
family struggles of my own.


367
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:32.996
Everything you're telling me
seems pretty normal,


368
00:27:33.223 --> 00:27:34.164
especially 'cause you're dealing

369
00:27:34.316 --> 00:27:36.058
with such a sudden loss,
you know.


370
00:27:37.744 --> 00:27:40.153
- Thank you for saying that.

371
00:27:40.172 --> 00:27:41.988
- Well, hey, if you ever need
someone to talk to,


372
00:27:42.082 --> 00:27:44.566
feel free to give me a call.

373
00:27:44.659 --> 00:27:46.902
- Well, thank you
for the coffee,


374
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.405
and for listening,
and for not suing me.


375
00:27:50.498 --> 00:27:54.259
- You're welcome.
Can I get you another?


376
00:27:54.353 --> 00:27:56.186
- What time is it?

377
00:27:56.413 --> 00:27:57.855
It's almost 5:00.

378
00:27:58.082 --> 00:28:01.525
- Shoot, no, I'm sorry.
I gotta get back.


379
00:28:01.752 --> 00:28:03.193
Rain check?

380
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.862
- Please.

381
00:28:06.681 --> 00:28:08.699
- Thank you, Jake Winters.

382
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.426
- Yeah, you bet.

383
00:28:28.888 --> 00:28:30.888
- Mom, the stove!

384
00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:38.637
Mom, Mom!

385
00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:47.553
What the hell?
Mom?


386
00:29:02.813 --> 00:29:03.754
Mom?

387
00:29:03.981 --> 00:29:05.497
- Shh.

388
00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:08.817
Can you hear that owl?

389
00:29:15.008 --> 00:29:17.935
Your father was obsessed
with it.


390
00:29:20.755 --> 00:29:24.849
He used to stand out here
all the time,


391
00:29:25.002 --> 00:29:26.592
just trying to find it.

392
00:29:29.356 --> 00:29:32.432
But he never did.

393
00:29:32.451 --> 00:29:36.769
- Is it in our tree?
'Cause I can't see it.


394
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:38.680
Maybe it's
in the neighbors' yard.


395
00:29:38.699 --> 00:29:43.685
- I think it was slowly
starting to drive him crazy.


396
00:29:43.778 --> 00:29:46.797
He kept saying
it was some type of omen.


397
00:29:51.453 --> 00:29:53.303
Maybe it's a sign.

398
00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:57.790
- Yeah, yeah, maybe.

399
00:30:02.706 --> 00:30:05.816
- It's cold out here,
and we can warm up inside,


400
00:30:05.967 --> 00:30:07.800
and I can make you dinner.

401
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.377
Let's just go inside.

402
00:31:10.382 --> 00:31:12.440
- Who's there?

403
00:31:27.399 --> 00:31:30.809
Liv, is that you?

404
00:32:09.942 --> 00:32:12.016
Ahh!

405
00:32:20.344 --> 00:32:22.193
- Mom?

406
00:32:28.109 --> 00:32:30.685
- Oh, my God, Mom!

407
00:32:30.778 --> 00:32:33.037
Please don't move!
Please don't.


408
00:32:33.132 --> 00:32:34.522
Don't move, don't move,
just don't move, don't move.


409
00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:36.299
No, don't move.
I'm here.


410
00:32:36.526 --> 00:32:37.375
I'll go get help.
I'll get help, okay?


411
00:32:37.527 --> 00:32:38.635
- A hand.

412
00:32:38.786 --> 00:32:40.971
- What?
- It was a hand.


413
00:32:41.122 --> 00:32:43.473
- What?
- It grabbed me.


414
00:32:43.625 --> 00:32:45.124
- Mom, Mom,
I'm gonna go get help.


415
00:32:45.144 --> 00:32:46.201
You fell down the stairs, okay?
I'm gonna go get help.


416
00:32:46.294 --> 00:32:47.702
- No, no, no, don't leave me.

417
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:48.961
- Mom, it's only gonna
take me five seconds.


418
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:51.130
- Don't leave me.
- I need to get the phone!


419
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.707
- Don't leave me.

420
00:32:52.726 --> 00:32:55.727
Oh, oh, oh.

421
00:33:02.995 --> 00:33:06.221
- Yes, hello?
Oh, please, I need help.


422
00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:08.331
My mom fell down the stairs.
Please, just I need help.


423
00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:12.060
It's 314 Pine Street.
Please, please just hurry.


424
00:33:12.078 --> 00:33:13.745
- He's still out there.

425
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:18.008
- Mom, it's okay, I'm here.
Just breathe deep.


426
00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:18.917
You're gonna be okay.

427
00:33:34.434 --> 00:33:36.193
- Hey, good news.

428
00:33:36.344 --> 00:33:38.862
We were able to repair
your mother's fractured hip.


429
00:33:39.013 --> 00:33:42.090
She's got some screws holding
it together while it heals.


430
00:33:42.108 --> 00:33:44.092
- When can I take her home?

431
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.352
- We'll keep her for
another day for observation,


432
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:47.929
but you're gonna have
to make arrangements


433
00:33:48.022 --> 00:33:49.522
to have someone help care
for her


434
00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:51.115
over these next several weeks,

435
00:33:51.268 --> 00:33:53.601
either in a rehabilitation
center or at home.


436
00:33:53.695 --> 00:33:55.937
- Yeah, I can actually do that.
I'm staying with her now, so...


437
00:33:55.956 --> 00:33:57.380
- Oh, good.

438
00:33:57.607 --> 00:33:59.107
I'll give her
a prescription for pain,


439
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.717
and she'll need a walking aid,

440
00:34:00.868 --> 00:34:03.202
and she'll also require
physical therapy


441
00:34:03.222 --> 00:34:04.554
to help rehabilitate that hip

442
00:34:04.781 --> 00:34:06.890
so she can ease back
into normal life.


443
00:34:07.117 --> 00:34:08.950
I can give you some names
if you like.


444
00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.286
- I actually think I have
a physical therapist


445
00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:12.637
that I can call as well, so...

446
00:34:12.731 --> 00:34:14.064
- Perfect.

447
00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:15.381
They should be
moving her out now,


448
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.624
and a nurse will let you know

449
00:34:16.643 --> 00:34:17.976
when you can go in and see her.

450
00:34:18.128 --> 00:34:19.794
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.


451
00:34:19.887 --> 00:34:21.463
- Thank you.
- Take care.


452
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.658
<i>- But what if I move
the pillow just a little bit?</i>


453
00:34:50.677 --> 00:34:53.344
<i>- I can move the pillow
by myself, Liv, okay?</i>


454
00:34:53.497 --> 00:34:58.924
Just have a seat.
Would you please sit down?


455
00:34:59.019 --> 00:35:01.352
- Yeah, just...
- Please.


456
00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:07.692
Why did you bring me
back here anyway?


457
00:35:07.844 --> 00:35:09.786
I would have rather
have gone anywhere,


458
00:35:09.937 --> 00:35:12.622
a hospital,
a rehabilitation center,


459
00:35:12.774 --> 00:35:14.532
anywhere except for this house.

460
00:35:16.202 --> 00:35:18.202
- I needed you here.

461
00:35:23.527 --> 00:35:25.635
- I'm sorry, honey.

462
00:35:25.862 --> 00:35:29.364
I'm just...
I'm just a little cranky.


463
00:35:29.382 --> 00:35:32.475
I know this is difficult
for you as well,


464
00:35:32.702 --> 00:35:34.811
and I appreciate
everything you're doing.


465
00:35:35.038 --> 00:35:37.872
- Well, I do have
a physical therapist


466
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:39.482
on his way to come meet you,

467
00:35:39.709 --> 00:35:42.134
and I have two more lined up
for tomorrow.


468
00:35:42.228 --> 00:35:43.820
- Where did you find him?

469
00:35:44.047 --> 00:35:47.824
- I met him in town
a couple of days ago.


470
00:35:47.975 --> 00:35:49.884
- In town?
- Yeah.


471
00:35:51.738 --> 00:35:54.497
- Well, is he good-looking?
- What?


472
00:35:54.724 --> 00:35:55.907
What does that have
to do with anything?


473
00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:57.000
What...I'm...

474
00:35:57.151 --> 00:35:59.410
- So he is good-looking.

475
00:35:59.504 --> 00:36:01.487
- Okay, okay.

476
00:36:01.581 --> 00:36:04.415
Look, I want to bring him here
for you to interview him, okay?


477
00:36:04.568 --> 00:36:06.734
I still have two more lined up
for tomorrow.


478
00:36:06.828 --> 00:36:09.253
Okay.

479
00:36:09.406 --> 00:36:11.072
- Oh.

480
00:36:13.835 --> 00:36:15.685
- Mm-hmm,
why are you acting so strange?


481
00:36:15.837 --> 00:36:17.428
- You know what?
I'm just gonna go.


482
00:36:17.522 --> 00:36:19.097
Okay, yep.

483
00:36:24.846 --> 00:36:26.679
Hi.
- Hey.


484
00:36:26.698 --> 00:36:28.606
- Hi, Jake.
Thank you for coming.


485
00:36:28.758 --> 00:36:30.108
- Sure, thanks for having me.

486
00:36:38.693 --> 00:36:42.045
- Jake, this is my mom,
Rebecca Garland.


487
00:36:42.196 --> 00:36:43.955
Mom, this is Jake Winters.

488
00:36:44.107 --> 00:36:45.382
- It's very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Garland.


489
00:36:45.533 --> 00:36:47.199
Thank you for having me.

490
00:36:47.293 --> 00:36:49.034
Olivia here has told me
a little bit about your family,


491
00:36:49.054 --> 00:36:50.278
and I just want to say

492
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:52.113
I'm really sorry
about your recent loss.


493
00:36:52.132 --> 00:36:54.966
- Oh, thank you.
You can call me Rebecca.


494
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.726
- Okay, Rebecca.

495
00:36:56.953 --> 00:36:59.712
So I heard we took
a nasty fall, huh?


496
00:36:59.806 --> 00:37:01.289
How's the hip doing?

497
00:37:01.307 --> 00:37:03.883
- Oh, it's been better.

498
00:37:03.977 --> 00:37:05.902
- Hmm, I bet, I bet.

499
00:37:06.053 --> 00:37:08.463
Well, I'm sure it's been nice
to have Olivia here.


500
00:37:08.556 --> 00:37:10.148
I only known her
for a short while,


501
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.224
but she seems like
a very special person.


502
00:37:12.318 --> 00:37:15.412
- Yes, she is.
- Mm-hmm.


503
00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:17.747
- And she never told me
how the two of you met.


504
00:37:17.899 --> 00:37:20.917
- Oh, well, actually,
that's a pretty funny story.


505
00:37:21.068 --> 00:37:22.977
She hit me with her car.

506
00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:24.403
- She what?

507
00:37:24.423 --> 00:37:26.756
- Literally, we met
by accident, yeah.


508
00:37:26.983 --> 00:37:29.592
- Mom, he was fine.
Just tell her you were fine.


509
00:37:29.819 --> 00:37:31.076
- Oh, yeah, yeah, totally fine.
All good.


510
00:37:31.096 --> 00:37:33.096
- I am so sorry.

511
00:37:33.247 --> 00:37:35.173
Olivia has never been
much of a driver.


512
00:37:35.325 --> 00:37:37.267
- Mom.

513
00:37:37.418 --> 00:37:39.919
- Liv, it took you three times
to pass your driving test.


514
00:37:40.013 --> 00:37:42.421
- Okay, that's 'cause they word
those questions to trick you.


515
00:37:42.441 --> 00:37:44.165
- That's true.
They actually do.


516
00:37:44.184 --> 00:37:45.775
I have a client
that helps write those exams,


517
00:37:46.002 --> 00:37:47.018
and he says
they're always trying


518
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.445
to find new ways
to trick people.


519
00:37:48.672 --> 00:37:50.672
One of the perks
of working for the DMV, huh?


520
00:37:50.765 --> 00:37:53.432
- That isn't true, is it?
- Well, maybe.


521
00:37:53.526 --> 00:37:56.010
People tell their physical
therapists some crazy stuff.


522
00:37:56.029 --> 00:37:58.196
This one lady told me
that she disinherited her son


523
00:37:58.348 --> 00:37:59.605
and left everything she owned

524
00:37:59.624 --> 00:38:02.016
to her French bulldog
named Lafayette.


525
00:38:02.035 --> 00:38:03.776
- Now, I know
that's not true, Jake.


526
00:38:03.795 --> 00:38:05.536
- Well, hey,
how do you think I felt?


527
00:38:05.689 --> 00:38:07.188
Son was the one that hired me.

528
00:38:07.281 --> 00:38:08.873
Lafayette refused
to pay my bills.


529
00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:10.633
Hmm.

530
00:38:13.472 --> 00:38:15.788
- Mom, did you

531
00:38:15.882 --> 00:38:18.716
actually wanna ask Jake
any physical therapy questions?


532
00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:24.539
- Oh, no, no, I think I have
all the information I need.


533
00:38:24.557 --> 00:38:27.299
So, Jake, when do we start?

534
00:38:27.319 --> 00:38:29.319
- How about tomorrow?

535
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.322
- Well, I'm not going anywhere,
so tomorrow sounds fine.


536
00:38:32.549 --> 00:38:33.639
10:00?

537
00:38:33.658 --> 00:38:35.325
- That sounds perfect.

538
00:40:28.923 --> 00:40:31.182
- Thought I'd make it
a bit more homey down here.


539
00:40:31.276 --> 00:40:32.734
You ready for your PT?

540
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:37.780
- I'm ready
to not feel 80 years old.


541
00:40:37.932 --> 00:40:39.190
That must be Jake.

542
00:40:39.284 --> 00:40:40.783
I'll go get him.

543
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.348
- How's our patient?

544
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:49.016
- She's great, yeah.
Come in.


545
00:40:50.854 --> 00:40:54.205
- Hi, hi.

546
00:40:54.357 --> 00:40:56.299
I saw there was
a young man here yesterday.


547
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.118
Is that your new PT?

548
00:40:59.212 --> 00:41:01.137
- He is.
- Is he good?


549
00:41:01.364 --> 00:41:03.306
- Well, you can see
for yourself.


550
00:41:11.374 --> 00:41:13.298
- I was hoping
that I could check him out


551
00:41:13.318 --> 00:41:15.801
just to make sure
that he's right for you.


552
00:41:15.895 --> 00:41:19.972
- You and Olivia.
- Hello.


553
00:41:19.991 --> 00:41:21.382
- Jake's here.

554
00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:22.884
- Good morning, ladies.

555
00:41:22.902 --> 00:41:24.810
Look at you.
Already looking better.


556
00:41:24.904 --> 00:41:26.387
- Well, I'm not feeling better.

557
00:41:26.406 --> 00:41:28.572
The medication
is not working today.


558
00:41:28.667 --> 00:41:31.392
- Okay, well, we'll try
some stretches today.


559
00:41:31.411 --> 00:41:34.671
See if we can show that pain
who is boss, all right?


560
00:41:34.822 --> 00:41:37.064
- Hi, I'm Agnes.

561
00:41:37.083 --> 00:41:39.825
I'm the best friend
and the next-door neighbor.


562
00:41:39.919 --> 00:41:43.237
I was hoping that maybe I could
just sit in and observe.


563
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.663
- Yeah, if it's all right
with Rebecca,


564
00:41:44.683 --> 00:41:45.848
it's all right by me.

565
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.592
- I suppose it is.

566
00:41:48.687 --> 00:41:50.745
- Well, I have some work
to do up in Dad's office,


567
00:41:50.838 --> 00:41:52.747
so I'll leave you guys to it.

568
00:41:52.765 --> 00:41:54.190
- Yeah, you want me
to let you know when we finish?


569
00:41:54.341 --> 00:41:55.674
I could show you
a couple of things


570
00:41:55.694 --> 00:41:57.601
and, you know,
might help her out later on.


571
00:41:57.754 --> 00:41:59.437
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.


572
00:42:02.275 --> 00:42:03.700
- Shall we get started?

573
00:42:03.851 --> 00:42:06.110
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, I'll be upstairs.


574
00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:07.778
- I'll set up right here.

575
00:42:07.931 --> 00:42:09.521
- Okay.

576
00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:12.024
- Okay, one to ten,
how bad are we hurting today?


577
00:42:12.118 --> 00:42:15.044
- Maybe 7 1/2, I guess.

578
00:42:15.196 --> 00:42:16.361
- Okay, okay, well,
we're gonna get you warmed up


579
00:42:16.381 --> 00:42:17.288
a little bit
before we get started.


580
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.881
- Okay.

581
00:42:27.617 --> 00:42:29.392
- Olivia.

582
00:42:34.307 --> 00:42:37.625
Come on, Dad, a little help?

583
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.515
"Ibis Significat Mortem."

584
00:43:20.186 --> 00:43:22.019
What does that mean?

585
00:43:33.016 --> 00:43:34.031
Okay.

586
00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:44.133
What does that even mean?

587
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.212
- Sorry to interrupt.

588
00:43:48.306 --> 00:43:50.139
You were really concentrating
right there, huh?


589
00:43:50.291 --> 00:43:52.457
- It's okay.
What's up?


590
00:43:52.552 --> 00:43:55.886
- Well, we just finished.
Your mom did really well today.


591
00:43:56.039 --> 00:43:57.629
She's slowly building
her strength back up.


592
00:43:57.723 --> 00:43:59.723
I was about to head out

593
00:43:59.818 --> 00:44:03.544
unless you want me
to show you those exercises.


594
00:44:03.563 --> 00:44:06.047
You sure you're okay?
You look like you just saw a...


595
00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:07.657
- A ghost?

596
00:44:07.808 --> 00:44:09.550
Please don't mention that
around my mom.


597
00:44:09.643 --> 00:44:10.993
She thinks that
the house is haunted.


598
00:44:11.145 --> 00:44:12.829
- Oh.
- Yeah.


599
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.905
- Okay, I promise I won't.

600
00:44:20.246 --> 00:44:23.564
You know, I took care
of my mom a few years ago.


601
00:44:23.583 --> 00:44:25.508
She had dementia.

602
00:44:25.735 --> 00:44:26.917
- I'm sorry.

603
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:27.826
That must have been really hard.

604
00:44:27.846 --> 00:44:30.905
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

605
00:44:30.923 --> 00:44:33.332
But, you know, it taught me
to really appreciate


606
00:44:33.351 --> 00:44:36.686
the small moments
that we had together.


607
00:44:36.837 --> 00:44:38.429
- Yeah, I wish
I could appreciate


608
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:40.431
the small moments with her.

609
00:44:40.525 --> 00:44:42.433
She's always talking
about ghosts and seeing things.


610
00:44:42.585 --> 00:44:44.009
It's just...

611
00:44:44.103 --> 00:44:46.087
- It'll get better.

612
00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.605
I know it seems rough right now,

613
00:44:47.757 --> 00:44:50.107
but it'll get better with time,
I promise.


614
00:44:50.259 --> 00:44:52.443
Or a change of scenery.

615
00:44:52.537 --> 00:44:54.203
- What, like a vacation?

616
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.205
- Or a move.
I mean, look at this place.


617
00:44:56.357 --> 00:44:57.781
This place is huge.

618
00:44:57.876 --> 00:44:59.858
This is giant.
How do you take care of it all?


619
00:44:59.878 --> 00:45:03.195
- Yeah, yeah,
I've heard that before.


620
00:45:03.214 --> 00:45:04.881
- Oh, I'm sorry.

621
00:45:05.108 --> 00:45:06.215
I didn't mean
to cross a line or anything.


622
00:45:06.442 --> 00:45:08.292
- No, no,
it's just...I'm really busy,


623
00:45:08.444 --> 00:45:11.295
so could you just
show me the exercises later?


624
00:45:11.389 --> 00:45:12.963
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Okay, I'll walk you out.


625
00:45:13.116 --> 00:45:14.632
- Thanks.

626
00:45:29.649 --> 00:45:31.556
I could probably fix that.

627
00:45:31.651 --> 00:45:34.485
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

628
00:45:34.579 --> 00:45:36.245
I hope you don't mind.
The front door was open.


629
00:45:36.472 --> 00:45:37.914
- It's okay.

630
00:45:39.325 --> 00:45:40.583
- Fridge problems?

631
00:45:41.811 --> 00:45:45.813
Okay, well,

632
00:45:45.906 --> 00:45:47.739
believe it or not, my grandad...

633
00:45:47.759 --> 00:45:50.151
He used to own
this appliance shop, right?


634
00:45:50.169 --> 00:45:52.169
I used to hang out there a lot
when I was a kid,


635
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:53.763
and I picked up a few things.

636
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:55.747
What seems
to be the problem here?


637
00:45:55.767 --> 00:45:57.767
- The stupid door
won't stay shut.


638
00:45:57.994 --> 00:45:59.936
It seems like every time
I come in here, it's open.


639
00:46:00.087 --> 00:46:01.771
- Well, let's see
what we can do.


640
00:46:05.443 --> 00:46:08.260
Oh, yeah, it's...

641
00:46:08.279 --> 00:46:10.688
- Liv, is Jake in there?

642
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.690
- Oh, I'll come back after.

643
00:46:12.842 --> 00:46:14.283
- Okay.

644
00:46:16.529 --> 00:46:20.456
- Oh, hey, if I said

645
00:46:20.683 --> 00:46:22.107
something the other day
that might've upset you...


646
00:46:22.126 --> 00:46:23.793
- No, it was me.

647
00:46:23.944 --> 00:46:25.869
I was tired,
and I wasn't myself.


648
00:46:26.022 --> 00:46:28.205
Sorry.

649
00:46:28.357 --> 00:46:31.208
- Could we do a reset?
- Yeah, I'd like that.


650
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.785
- Me too.

651
00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:35.930
All right, I'll be back.

652
00:46:54.383 --> 00:46:58.736
What were you doing?
What were you doing?


653
00:47:19.684 --> 00:47:22.167
"Just in case something
should happen to me,


654
00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:24.020
"this letter will be a way

655
00:47:24.247 --> 00:47:25.763
for my family to have
the answers they deserve."


656
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.844
"Rebecca and Olivia, you're all
I've ever cared about.


657
00:47:32.938 --> 00:47:34.421
<i>- "With my whole heart,</i>

658
00:47:34.515 --> 00:47:36.699
<i>"I apologize
for what I have done.</i>


659
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.093
<i>"I have caused pain

660
00:47:39.111 --> 00:47:41.186
<i>"and trusted me.</i>

661
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.373

662
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.451

663
00:47:47.545 --> 00:47:49.545
<i>"I know you worried
that we couldn't afford it,</i>


664
00:47:49.772 --> 00:47:52.364
<i>"and, truth be told,
we couldn't.</i>


665
00:47:52.458 --> 00:47:55.276
<i>"So in doing what I did,
I hurt not just my clients,</i>


666
00:47:55.369 --> 00:47:58.537

whom I love so much.</i>


667
00:47:58.631 --> 00:48:02.132

668
00:48:02.285 --> 00:48:03.375

669
00:48:03.394 --> 00:48:05.377

670
00:48:05.471 --> 00:48:08.289
<i>I never intended to get
you both involved in this."</i>


671
00:48:08.307 --> 00:48:09.807
- "Please, forgive me."

672
00:48:23.306 --> 00:48:25.489
<i>- Police are still searching
for this man</i>


673
00:48:25.641 --> 00:48:27.825
<i>after he assaulted
two arresting officers.</i>


674
00:48:27.919 --> 00:48:30.477
<i>He has been identified
as Peter Rawlings.</i>


675
00:48:30.496 --> 00:48:35.073
- Hey, Mom, can I ask you
a question about Dad?


676
00:48:35.167 --> 00:48:36.834
- Of course, honey.

677
00:48:44.918 --> 00:48:46.418
- What do you know
about Dad's work?


678
00:48:46.437 --> 00:48:49.513
- Well, I know he loved his job,

679
00:48:49.665 --> 00:48:53.000
and he loved being able to help
people invest in their futures.


680
00:48:53.018 --> 00:48:55.336
Lately, things had gotten
a little more stressful,


681
00:48:55.354 --> 00:48:59.949
you know, late nights
and working seven days a week.


682
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.600
- Do you know why?

683
00:49:01.619 --> 00:49:03.953
- No, I asked him,

684
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.455
but he assured me
everything was fine.


685
00:49:06.682 --> 00:49:08.607
- Did he ever mention
any trouble?


686
00:49:08.701 --> 00:49:10.701
- Trouble?
No.


687
00:49:10.853 --> 00:49:13.203
Well, except
for the late nights.


688
00:49:15.708 --> 00:49:19.468
I know he was very proud
to be able to provide for us,


689
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.287
especially your education.

690
00:49:22.381 --> 00:49:25.975
He worked really hard
to put you through school, Liv.


691
00:49:26.126 --> 00:49:29.553
- Yeah, yeah, he did.

692
00:49:43.719 --> 00:49:46.403
- There you go.
Nice and slow now.


693
00:49:46.555 --> 00:49:47.329
- Okay.
- Put your knee up.


694
00:49:47.556 --> 00:49:49.147
- Yes, yes.

695
00:49:49.167 --> 00:49:50.391
- Take your time.

696
00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:52.168
- Like that?

697
00:49:52.319 --> 00:49:53.560
- Now stretch
your right leg out.


698
00:49:53.579 --> 00:49:54.986
- Okay, wait, wait, okay.

699
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.565
- Yes, that's good.

700
00:49:58.584 --> 00:50:00.918
Nice, nice.

701
00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.345
It feels good to laugh again.

702
00:50:03.497 --> 00:50:05.088
Ever since Olivia has been back,

703
00:50:05.241 --> 00:50:07.349
it's been so tense.

704
00:50:07.501 --> 00:50:09.593
Now that it's
just the two of us,


705
00:50:09.745 --> 00:50:11.745
this house feels like a morgue.

706
00:50:11.764 --> 00:50:14.172
- That's tough.

707
00:50:14.192 --> 00:50:16.841
Well, it is a gorgeous house,

708
00:50:16.861 --> 00:50:19.695
but I see how it would be a lot
to have to look after.


709
00:50:19.922 --> 00:50:22.180
- I'm hoping
that I can convince her


710
00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.758
to support my decision
to sell this place.


711
00:50:24.777 --> 00:50:28.495
I feel like a new beginning
will help us heal.


712
00:50:44.055 --> 00:50:46.222
- Hey, Olivia!

713
00:50:52.288 --> 00:50:55.122
Olivia!

714
00:50:55.215 --> 00:50:58.792
I see Mr. McCharming
is back again.


715
00:50:58.885 --> 00:51:00.885
- Wait, what are you
talking about?


716
00:51:00.905 --> 00:51:02.404
- If I were you,

717
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:03.981
I wouldn't leave that man
alone with Rebecca.


718
00:51:04.075 --> 00:51:05.799
- Why?

719
00:51:05.818 --> 00:51:07.301
- I did happen to see him

720
00:51:07.319 --> 00:51:10.304
snooping around
behind the house yesterday.


721
00:51:10.322 --> 00:51:13.323
- Wait, in our backyard?
- Yes.


722
00:51:13.417 --> 00:51:17.086
I have a clear view from my
bedroom window, and I saw him.


723
00:51:17.313 --> 00:51:19.738
He was poking around,
looking over the fence


724
00:51:19.757 --> 00:51:21.757
like some sort of a peeping Tom.

725
00:51:21.984 --> 00:51:24.743
He was even holding up
his phone like a camera,


726
00:51:24.762 --> 00:51:26.670
taking pictures.

727
00:51:26.822 --> 00:51:29.823
Maybe he was casing the place
for a robbery.


728
00:51:31.844 --> 00:51:34.252
- Jake?
- Yes, Jake.


729
00:51:34.346 --> 00:51:36.830
Have you seen his car
over there, huh?


730
00:51:36.923 --> 00:51:39.833
Look at that car.
I've counted four.


731
00:51:39.926 --> 00:51:41.518
A different car
every time he visits,


732
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.762
all luxury vehicles.

733
00:51:43.781 --> 00:51:46.115
Now you tell me, what kind
of a physical therapist


734
00:51:46.266 --> 00:51:49.451
can afford cars like that?

735
00:51:49.603 --> 00:51:51.845
- Yeah, it is kind of odd.

736
00:51:51.864 --> 00:51:53.455
- Surely you've checked
his references.


737
00:51:54.959 --> 00:51:57.442
- No.
- What?


738
00:51:57.536 --> 00:51:59.186
Why?
- I don't know.


739
00:51:59.204 --> 00:52:00.704
I just...everything's been
so hectic lately,


740
00:52:00.798 --> 00:52:02.205
and Mom liked him.

741
00:52:02.358 --> 00:52:03.524
So I didn't even think
to check anything.


742
00:52:03.542 --> 00:52:05.634
- Okay, listen.

743
00:52:05.861 --> 00:52:07.469
You go off and do your business.

744
00:52:07.621 --> 00:52:09.305
I am gonna go check in
on your mother.


745
00:52:09.456 --> 00:52:11.289
I'll make sure he stays in line.

746
00:52:11.383 --> 00:52:15.144
- Thank you, Agnes.
- Yes, of course.


747
00:53:22.104 --> 00:53:24.955
- Letter of intent.

748
00:53:45.218 --> 00:53:47.961
- Paris was his favorite.
- Oh.


749
00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:50.480
- You know, yes, Eric loved...
- The pictures were stunning.


750
00:53:50.574 --> 00:53:52.132
- To go to Paris, yes.

751
00:53:52.225 --> 00:53:54.392
- I sent them, like,
to everyone.


752
00:53:54.412 --> 00:53:57.228
- Oh, there you are.
I didn't even hear you leave.


753
00:53:57.248 --> 00:53:59.397
- You were busy with PT.

754
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:01.158
- Well, I best be getting home.

755
00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:02.993
- Oh, okay.

756
00:54:03.145 --> 00:54:05.312
Well, thank you so much, Agnes.
This tea was delicious.


757
00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:07.664
- Oh, of course.
There's more tomorrow.


758
00:54:07.816 --> 00:54:09.499
- Thanks, thank you.

759
00:54:13.264 --> 00:54:15.172
- I just will go out the back.

760
00:54:17.601 --> 00:54:19.660
- So what's up, sweetie?

761
00:54:19.753 --> 00:54:21.828
- How about I drop this
down over there,


762
00:54:21.922 --> 00:54:22.938
and then we can order dinner?

763
00:54:23.165 --> 00:54:24.848
- Hey, what is that?

764
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.775
- Oh, it's just boring stuff
from Dad's office


765
00:54:26.927 --> 00:54:28.018
that I need to go through.

766
00:54:28.112 --> 00:54:30.112
I'm gonna be right back.

767
00:54:35.619 --> 00:54:38.011
- So what's up?

768
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:39.788
- Something
at my dad's office today.


769
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.031
It's about Jake.

770
00:54:41.183 --> 00:54:43.200
- What?

771
00:54:43.352 --> 00:54:44.460
- Here.

772
00:54:50.634 --> 00:54:52.859
- Winters as in...

773
00:54:52.878 --> 00:54:54.452
- Jake Winters.

774
00:54:54.546 --> 00:54:56.305
This file is
about his father, John.


775
00:54:56.456 --> 00:54:59.141
Okay, I mean, do you know
what that means?


776
00:54:59.368 --> 00:55:01.535
- That Jake's father
knew your father.


777
00:55:01.628 --> 00:55:03.645
- He was a client
of my father's,


778
00:55:03.797 --> 00:55:08.132
and not only that,
he was suing him.


779
00:55:08.152 --> 00:55:12.045
- No.
- Yeah, and there's more.


780
00:55:12.138 --> 00:55:13.805
So I found a letter from my dad.

781
00:55:13.899 --> 00:55:15.324
He sounded paranoid,

782
00:55:15.551 --> 00:55:16.808
and I think someone
was out to hurt him.


783
00:55:16.827 --> 00:55:18.476
- But who?
- I don't know.


784
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:20.144
Look, all I'm saying is

785
00:55:20.164 --> 00:55:22.146
that Jake's dad could have
been one of those people.


786
00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:24.241
I mean, I looked this guy up.
He's worth millions.


787
00:55:24.393 --> 00:55:26.409
- That explains the cars.

788
00:55:26.562 --> 00:55:28.837
If Jake's father is loaded,

789
00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:31.507
then Jake probably has
a trust fund or something.


790
00:55:31.734 --> 00:55:33.083
- Right.

791
00:55:33.235 --> 00:55:35.902
- Wait, you don't think

792
00:55:35.996 --> 00:55:38.180
that Jake's dad
killed your dad, do you?


793
00:55:40.576 --> 00:55:42.592
- My father's death
was ruled an accident,


794
00:55:42.745 --> 00:55:47.581
but I'm starting to think
me meeting Jake wasn't.


795
00:55:47.674 --> 00:55:50.934
- Whoa,
that is a lot to process.


796
00:55:51.028 --> 00:55:52.419
- You can't tell my mom.

797
00:55:52.512 --> 00:55:54.178
I think that
she's gonna get upset.


798
00:55:54.273 --> 00:55:58.425
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
No, thank you for telling me.


799
00:55:58.518 --> 00:56:00.944
We just have
to find some answers.


800
00:56:01.038 --> 00:56:02.612
- Okay, but how?

801
00:56:02.706 --> 00:56:04.765
- You know, I'm gonna go home,

802
00:56:04.783 --> 00:56:07.267
and when I come back,
I'm gonna have a plan.


803
00:56:09.547 --> 00:56:13.940
Olivia, thank you
for trusting me with this.


804
00:56:14.034 --> 00:56:16.293
- Of course.
No, thank you.


805
00:56:44.156 --> 00:56:46.564
Whoa, oh, my God.

806
00:56:46.584 --> 00:56:48.066
I'm so sorry.

807
00:56:48.085 --> 00:56:48.900
I feel like
I'm always sneaking up on you.


808
00:56:48.919 --> 00:56:50.586
I'm the worst.

809
00:56:50.813 --> 00:56:52.813
- Yeah, I guess
I should pay more attention.


810
00:56:52.831 --> 00:56:55.148
- The office door
was open again, my bad.


811
00:56:55.241 --> 00:56:56.592
- I'm pretty sure I locked it.

812
00:56:56.743 --> 00:56:58.076
- I just left my bag here.

813
00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:00.153
Wanted to come say hey
before I left.


814
00:57:00.172 --> 00:57:01.579
- You know what?
I'm gonna go check on my mom.


815
00:57:01.673 --> 00:57:05.508
- Well, hey, before you do,
I was hoping we could talk.


816
00:57:05.603 --> 00:57:07.436
- About what?

817
00:57:07.663 --> 00:57:11.181
- Well, I have been thinking
about that day


818
00:57:11.333 --> 00:57:14.167
that we had coffee,
and we really haven't had


819
00:57:14.186 --> 00:57:16.111
a chance
to talk like that since then.


820
00:57:16.262 --> 00:57:19.597
So I was hoping
we could do it again sometime.


821
00:57:19.691 --> 00:57:23.176
You know, since the first time
was such a success, right?


822
00:57:23.195 --> 00:57:25.195
- Yeah, yeah, actually,
you know, lately,


823
00:57:25.289 --> 00:57:26.622
I've been pretty busy,

824
00:57:26.849 --> 00:57:27.956
so I don't know when
I'd be able to go out again.


825
00:57:29.852 --> 00:57:34.254
- Yeah, yeah, no worries.
Maybe another time.


826
00:57:37.801 --> 00:57:39.526
All right, well,
see you tomorrow.


827
00:57:39.544 --> 00:57:42.362
- About that day,
what were you doing


828
00:57:42.381 --> 00:57:45.715
outside
of my dad's office building?


829
00:57:45.868 --> 00:57:47.717
- I was walking to go
get some coffee, remember?


830
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:50.203
- But where were you
coming from?


831
00:57:50.296 --> 00:57:54.224
- Oh, my goodness.
Who did this?


832
00:57:54.318 --> 00:57:55.400
Who did this?

833
00:57:59.657 --> 00:58:01.064
- No, no, no.

834
00:58:01.216 --> 00:58:02.883
- Mom, what's wrong?

835
00:58:02.976 --> 00:58:04.159
- Look at this.
- What happened?


836
00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:05.886
- Who would do this?

837
00:58:05.979 --> 00:58:07.979
- Who the hell would do that?

838
00:58:07.998 --> 00:58:10.557
- Look at this.

839
00:58:10.575 --> 00:58:14.318
This is so cruel.

840
00:58:15.914 --> 00:58:18.415
- I'll grab it, I'll grab it,
I'll grab it.


841
00:58:18.567 --> 00:58:20.342
- My photos.

842
00:58:20.493 --> 00:58:21.843
- Oh, Mom, I'm sorry.

843
00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:23.753
- I can't believe that.
- I know, I know, I know.


844
00:58:23.906 --> 00:58:25.847
- Look at these.
- It's scary.


845
00:58:26.074 --> 00:58:27.683
We're gonna figure this out.
- Hello?


846
00:58:27.834 --> 00:58:29.743
- What is happening
in this house?


847
00:58:31.763 --> 00:58:34.005
- That's weird.

848
00:58:34.024 --> 00:58:37.417
Nobody was there.
I don't know.


849
00:58:37.436 --> 00:58:40.178
- Who is knocking on the door?
- I don't know.


850
00:58:42.107 --> 00:58:43.590
- You hang tight.
I'll grab it, I'll grab it.


851
00:58:43.683 --> 00:58:45.258
- Did you see those pictures?

852
00:58:45.277 --> 00:58:46.943
I need to go upstairs
and check on the other albums.


853
00:58:47.095 --> 00:58:48.445
- Hey.

854
00:58:51.024 --> 00:58:55.043
Hi, what's going on?

855
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.786
- Agnes was at the back,
but there was no one


856
00:58:56.939 --> 00:58:57.879
at the front.
I don't know.


857
00:58:58.106 --> 00:58:59.363
- Agnes, did you see
anything outside?


858
00:58:59.383 --> 00:59:01.049
- No.

859
00:59:01.276 --> 00:59:03.552
- Okay, I'll take a look
around the property.


860
00:59:03.703 --> 00:59:06.613
- Show her the albums.
Show them to her.


861
00:59:12.879 --> 00:59:14.621
Look at that.

862
00:59:14.714 --> 00:59:17.399
- Who would do something
like this?


863
00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:19.901
- Someone or something

864
00:59:20.128 --> 00:59:22.462
in this house is
responsible for that.


865
00:59:22.555 --> 00:59:25.407
- Something, like a spirit?

866
00:59:25.634 --> 00:59:28.059
Are you still feeling
like you're being haunted?


867
00:59:28.153 --> 00:59:30.895
- I know
you two think I'm crazy.


868
00:59:30.914 --> 00:59:34.641
I have been through phone calls
from my dead husband,


869
00:59:34.659 --> 00:59:36.493
footsteps in the middle
of the night


870
00:59:36.645 --> 00:59:38.903
when both of us are asleep,

871
00:59:38.997 --> 00:59:41.481
hands grabbing me, Olivia.

872
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.592
How can you explain it?

873
00:59:43.743 --> 00:59:46.653
- There's probably a reasonable
explanation for all of it.


874
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:48.746
- That's what I came over
to tell you.


875
00:59:48.766 --> 00:59:51.341
I've come up with a plan

876
00:59:51.493 --> 00:59:54.085
so we can figure out
who this is.


877
00:59:54.104 --> 00:59:56.830
I overnighted
some fancy camera equipment.


878
00:59:56.923 --> 00:59:58.607
We'll set them up
around the house


879
00:59:58.758 --> 01:00:00.942
and just wait
and see who appears.


880
01:00:01.094 --> 01:00:04.170
I'll bring them over as soon
as they arrive tomorrow, okay?


881
01:00:04.189 --> 01:00:08.116
- How are we gonna get proof
if it's something else?


882
01:00:08.268 --> 01:00:10.860
- Mom.
- I'm with Olivia on this.


883
01:00:11.013 --> 01:00:13.363
I think there's
a reasonable explanation.


884
01:00:13.457 --> 01:00:15.290
- What?

885
01:00:15.517 --> 01:00:18.201
- I have my suspicions
who it might be.


886
01:00:20.464 --> 01:00:22.798
- I think it's a great idea
to set up cameras.


887
01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:26.134
- Couldn't hurt to try, right?
- Try what?


888
01:00:26.286 --> 01:00:27.694
- What'd you find outside?

889
01:00:27.787 --> 01:00:29.379
- Oh, there's nothing outside,

890
01:00:29.531 --> 01:00:30.697
but you guys should really think

891
01:00:30.715 --> 01:00:31.865
about getting some cameras.

892
01:00:31.883 --> 01:00:33.141
- That's what we were just...

893
01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:35.310
- Saying that I should head
to the market,


894
01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:38.872
and, Rebecca,
you should get some rest.


895
01:00:38.965 --> 01:00:41.483
- Yes, I think
you should get some rest.


896
01:00:41.634 --> 01:00:43.226
I'll walk you out.

897
01:00:45.972 --> 01:00:48.381
- Okay, then.

898
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
You get some rest.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?


899
01:01:01.839 --> 01:01:06.566
- Your mom did really well.
- Yeah, I saw.


900
01:01:06.585 --> 01:01:08.009
- Did you call somebody
about that fridge yet?


901
01:01:08.161 --> 01:01:09.344
- Oh, no, not yet.

902
01:01:09.571 --> 01:01:10.995
- I can totally look
at it if you...


903
01:01:11.014 --> 01:01:12.347
- No, it's totally fine.
- No, please, it's no hassle.


904
01:01:12.498 --> 01:01:14.182
- Oh...
- I got you.


905
01:01:14.334 --> 01:01:18.912
- What?
- Let me see.


906
01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:21.505
- Jake, Jake.
- You know what?


907
01:01:21.525 --> 01:01:23.174
You probably just need
to clean this thing right here.


908
01:01:23.268 --> 01:01:24.526
I bet that does it.

909
01:01:24.677 --> 01:01:25.768
You got any
cleaning spray under here?


910
01:01:34.354 --> 01:01:37.113
- Jake, how come you never talk
about your father?


911
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.208
- My father?

912
01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.951
- Yeah, you talk
about your grandfather,


913
01:01:42.104 --> 01:01:43.603
but never your father.
Why?


914
01:01:46.124 --> 01:01:48.532
- We're not very close.

915
01:01:48.552 --> 01:01:49.885
- Do you guys ever see
each other?


916
01:01:50.036 --> 01:01:51.553
- Not really.

917
01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:53.871
Doesn't exactly approve
of what I do.


918
01:01:53.965 --> 01:01:57.041
- He doesn't approve of you
being a physical therapist?


919
01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.543
- No, he wanted me
to be a real doctor.


920
01:01:59.563 --> 01:02:01.971
Probably thinks I could have
saved my mom if I was.


921
01:02:06.311 --> 01:02:08.719
- I'm sorry.

922
01:02:08.739 --> 01:02:11.907
- It's on him, not me.

923
01:02:12.058 --> 01:02:17.320
All right, well,
that should do it.


924
01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:20.231
Let me know if you have
any other problems.


925
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.808
See you tomorrow.

926
01:02:24.146 --> 01:02:25.995
- Thank you.

927
01:02:37.267 --> 01:02:39.492
- That is so strange.

928
01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:42.270
Agnes was supposed to come by
to bring the cameras,


929
01:02:42.422 --> 01:02:44.180
and it's not like her
to be late.


930
01:02:46.443 --> 01:02:48.109
Can you try to call her
from your phone, please?


931
01:02:48.261 --> 01:02:50.687
- Yeah, yeah, I'll just...

932
01:02:56.936 --> 01:02:59.770
It's straight to voicemail.
I...


933
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:02.532
- I have a very bad feeling
about this, Liv.


934
01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:07.187
- Okay, why don't I
just go check on her, okay?


935
01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:09.113
- Okay, keep your phone nearby.

936
01:03:09.207 --> 01:03:11.191
- I have it, I have it.

937
01:03:40.555 --> 01:03:41.738
Agnes?

938
01:03:44.167 --> 01:03:46.226
Agnes!

939
01:03:52.843 --> 01:03:55.735
Sorry, you scared me.

940
01:03:55.754 --> 01:03:57.661
- Yeah, I was just gonna
deliver this package,


941
01:03:57.756 --> 01:03:59.255
but no one is here.

942
01:04:02.168 --> 01:04:03.667
- Oh, yeah,
she's expecting these.


943
01:04:03.687 --> 01:04:05.261
I can take 'em to her.

944
01:04:07.916 --> 01:04:09.415
- Okay.

945
01:04:17.367 --> 01:04:23.204
- Agnes, Agnes,
I have our cameras.


946
01:04:26.768 --> 01:04:28.951
Agnes!

947
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.294
Agnes?

948
01:04:41.283 --> 01:04:43.132
Agnes?

949
01:05:02.304 --> 01:05:04.153
Agnes?

950
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:10.660
Agnes?

951
01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:14.163
Agnes!

952
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.167
Agnes, I'm coming upstairs!

953
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.716
Ahh!

954
01:06:09.053 --> 01:06:11.721
No, no, no, no.

955
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.485
I need to report a murder.

956
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.384
- Well, yeah,
that's how I found her.


957
01:06:24.402 --> 01:06:26.810
I didn't touch her.
- Okay.


958
01:06:26.905 --> 01:06:28.738
Do you know of anyone who would
want to hurt Miss Kretchner?


959
01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:31.499
- No.

960
01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:33.242
Well, I don't know
if it means anything,


961
01:06:33.395 --> 01:06:36.229
but there's been this new guy
that's been coming around.


962
01:06:36.247 --> 01:06:37.914
He's a physical therapist
for my mom.


963
01:06:38.066 --> 01:06:40.400
- Anything suspicious about him?

964
01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:43.085
- Agnes didn't like him,
and she didn't trust him.


965
01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.013
- She say why?

966
01:06:45.164 --> 01:06:47.573
- Well, one time, she found him
lingering in our backyard,


967
01:06:47.592 --> 01:06:50.243
looking into the neighbors',

968
01:06:50.261 --> 01:06:52.687
but I'm not trying to get
anyone in any trouble, so...


969
01:06:52.838 --> 01:06:54.171
- No, we're just
checking all leads.


970
01:06:54.191 --> 01:06:56.082
What's his name?

971
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.859
- Jake Winters.

972
01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:00.420
He's supposed to come over
today for my mom's session.


973
01:07:00.438 --> 01:07:03.105
- Okay, well, I'll make sure
an officer questions him.


974
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.033
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
before I forget,


975
01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.351
there was a delivery guy
when I got here.


976
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:09.095
I don't know if that matters.

977
01:07:09.188 --> 01:07:11.021
- Did he seem suspicious at all?

978
01:07:11.041 --> 01:07:12.373
- I don't know.

979
01:07:12.525 --> 01:07:15.117
Just like
a regular delivery guy.


980
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:16.544
- Well, I'll keep that in mind
and let you know


981
01:07:16.696 --> 01:07:17.954
if I have
any more questions, okay?


982
01:07:18.048 --> 01:07:20.698
- Okay.

983
01:07:34.973 --> 01:07:40.217
- What?
Oh, oh, no.


984
01:07:40.311 --> 01:07:43.404
Olivia, no, oh God.
I'm done.


985
01:07:43.556 --> 01:07:44.981
- Mom, what you doing?

986
01:07:45.133 --> 01:07:47.149
- I'm done.
I've got to get out of here.


987
01:07:47.302 --> 01:07:48.801
- Wait, please, wait, wait.

988
01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.912
- I'm leaving, Olivia,
and don't try to stop me.


989
01:07:51.063 --> 01:07:52.896
- Mom, you're
in no condition to leave.


990
01:07:52.916 --> 01:07:53.973
I know what happened
to Agnes is terrible,


991
01:07:54.066 --> 01:07:55.232
but just please get back in bed.

992
01:07:55.326 --> 01:07:57.827
- Are you insane, Olivia?

993
01:07:57.979 --> 01:08:00.980
My best friend is dead,

994
01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:03.666
and my husband,

995
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.652
and this house
clearly wants me out of here.


996
01:08:06.671 --> 01:08:07.670
Mom.

997
01:08:07.764 --> 01:08:08.988
- Move.

998
01:08:09.007 --> 01:08:11.173
- Just please, just wait.

999
01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:20.666
- Hi.
- Hi.


1000
01:08:20.685 --> 01:08:23.444
- Hey, yeah.
- Thank you.


1001
01:08:23.596 --> 01:08:25.021
Sorry to disturb you.

1002
01:08:25.115 --> 01:08:26.781
Detective Hansen sent me

1003
01:08:26.932 --> 01:08:29.784
to see when Mr. Winters
usually arrives.


1004
01:08:29.935 --> 01:08:31.844
- Yeah, I actually just got
a text from him saying


1005
01:08:31.937 --> 01:08:33.696
he's not coming today, so...

1006
01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:36.624
- Well, Detective Hansen has
the contact information


1007
01:08:36.851 --> 01:08:40.444
that you gave him,
so we'll track him down.


1008
01:08:40.538 --> 01:08:42.855
- Track him down?
- Thank you.


1009
01:08:42.874 --> 01:08:44.206
- Excuse me.

1010
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:50.454
- Why do they wanna talk
to Jake?


1011
01:08:50.473 --> 01:08:52.381
- I don't know.

1012
01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.701
- You must've
told them something.


1013
01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.703
What did you say?

1014
01:08:57.722 --> 01:08:59.722
- Well, they asked if I'd seen
anything suspicious with Jake,


1015
01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:02.391
and I said we all didn't
know him that well,


1016
01:09:02.544 --> 01:09:04.727
and that Agnes didn't like him.

1017
01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:06.637
- What?

1018
01:09:06.656 --> 01:09:09.231
- Mom, some things just don't
add up about Jake, okay?


1019
01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:11.475
Jake's father was
an angry client of Dad's.


1020
01:09:11.494 --> 01:09:12.994
Yeah, and I think

1021
01:09:13.221 --> 01:09:15.479
when Jake and I met,
it wasn't by accident.


1022
01:09:15.498 --> 01:09:18.499
- Olivia, you can't keep
that kind of thing from me.


1023
01:09:18.651 --> 01:09:20.335
You need to tell me stuff
like that.


1024
01:09:20.486 --> 01:09:22.578
I am not a child.
I am your mother.


1025
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:23.913
- I'm sorry.

1026
01:09:24.065 --> 01:09:25.731
I just didn't want to upset you.

1027
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.751
- I want you to take me
to rehab right now.


1028
01:09:28.845 --> 01:09:30.570
- No, I can't.

1029
01:09:30.663 --> 01:09:33.514
- Pass me the phone.
I'll do it myself.


1030
01:09:33.666 --> 01:09:36.667
But I am not staying in
this house for another minute,


1031
01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:38.244
and neither are you.

1032
01:09:41.358 --> 01:09:43.416
What's wrong?

1033
01:09:43.434 --> 01:09:45.585
- I'm sorry I've been
so difficult with you lately.


1034
01:09:45.678 --> 01:09:48.104
I'm just...when I saw you sitting

1035
01:09:48.256 --> 01:09:49.864
at the bottom of the stairs,

1036
01:09:50.015 --> 01:09:52.091
I just thought,
"I can't lose her, too."


1037
01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:55.444
- Liv.

1038
01:09:57.022 --> 01:09:59.265
- But you're right.
You're right.


1039
01:09:59.358 --> 01:10:00.282
You shouldn't have to stay here

1040
01:10:00.435 --> 01:10:01.767
after what happened to Agnes.

1041
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:06.881
Maybe you could stay
with Aunt Mazie.


1042
01:10:07.032 --> 01:10:09.867
I think her cruise
just got back.


1043
01:10:09.886 --> 01:10:12.128
But only until I can arrange
something with the center.


1044
01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.558
- You need to come with me.
You are not safe here.


1045
01:10:17.785 --> 01:10:20.136
- Mom, I have some stuff
I have to do.


1046
01:10:20.288 --> 01:10:22.121
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

1047
01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.307
- Promise me you'll come
as soon as possible, okay?


1048
01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.810
- I will.

1049
01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:30.146
Maybe if we called Aunt Mazie.

1050
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:49.709
Dad.

1051
01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:05.741
What the...

1052
01:12:34.364 --> 01:12:36.255
Ahh!
- Oh!


1053
01:12:36.274 --> 01:12:38.107
- Get out!

1054
01:12:46.934 --> 01:12:48.692
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>

1055
01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:49.877
- I need help!

1056
01:12:55.943 --> 01:12:57.960
- We searched the house
from top to bottom.


1057
01:12:58.054 --> 01:13:00.946
No evidence of a break-in,
and the kitchen camera was off.


1058
01:13:00.965 --> 01:13:02.539
- So what does that mean?

1059
01:13:02.559 --> 01:13:04.708
The attacker was in my house?

1060
01:13:04.802 --> 01:13:07.136
- Or someone has a key.

1061
01:13:07.288 --> 01:13:09.638
- The only other person
that had a key was Agnes.


1062
01:13:09.732 --> 01:13:12.716
- Well, it could be someone
stole the key from her house,


1063
01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:14.551
maybe after they killed her.

1064
01:13:14.571 --> 01:13:16.812
Are you sure
you don't wanna see a doctor?


1065
01:13:16.964 --> 01:13:19.556
- No, no, I'm fine.

1066
01:13:19.576 --> 01:13:21.558
Did you bring in Jake Winters
for questioning yet?


1067
01:13:21.578 --> 01:13:22.743
- Unfortunately,
we haven't been able


1068
01:13:22.895 --> 01:13:25.062
to locate Mr. Winters yet.

1069
01:13:25.081 --> 01:13:27.415
The address on his license
was an old one.


1070
01:13:27.566 --> 01:13:30.309
- We've got an APB out for him.
He'll turn up.


1071
01:13:30.402 --> 01:13:32.645
- It's him.
It has to be him, right?


1072
01:13:32.738 --> 01:13:34.814
I didn't see him,
but it has to be Jake.


1073
01:13:34.907 --> 01:13:36.257
- Well, do you have any reason

1074
01:13:36.408 --> 01:13:38.667
to believe that
he'd target you specifically?


1075
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:42.763
- Maybe he figured out that
I reported him as a suspect.


1076
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:44.765
Or he wants revenge

1077
01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:47.417
for what he thinks
my father did to his family.


1078
01:13:47.437 --> 01:13:49.678
- What'd your father do?

1079
01:13:49.772 --> 01:13:52.756
- I recently found out
that his dad was a client


1080
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:55.835
of my dad's,
and Mr. Winters alleged


1081
01:13:55.853 --> 01:13:58.520
that my dad
was stealing money from him


1082
01:13:58.615 --> 01:14:00.339
instead of investing it.

1083
01:14:00.432 --> 01:14:03.618
So he was suing my dad
up until the day he died.


1084
01:14:03.769 --> 01:14:05.344
- Sorry to hear about your loss.

1085
01:14:05.437 --> 01:14:07.680
- Did Jake ever mention
any that to you?


1086
01:14:07.698 --> 01:14:09.865
- No, he claims he doesn't have
a good relationship


1087
01:14:09.959 --> 01:14:12.126
with his father,
but the cars that he drives?


1088
01:14:12.353 --> 01:14:14.520
That's not the salary
of a physical therapist.


1089
01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:15.704
- Do you have that list
of vehicles


1090
01:14:15.857 --> 01:14:16.872
registered to Jake Winters?

1091
01:14:17.024 --> 01:14:19.467
- Yeah.

1092
01:14:19.694 --> 01:14:21.469
- Thank you.

1093
01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:28.384
BMW 5 Series 2019,

1094
01:14:28.478 --> 01:14:33.889
Porsche Panamera 2016,
Alfa Romeo Giulia 2018.


1095
01:14:33.983 --> 01:14:37.634
- Nothing after 2019.

1096
01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:40.396
If your father somehow caused
the Winters' finances


1097
01:14:40.548 --> 01:14:43.215
to derail,
then you may be right.


1098
01:14:43.234 --> 01:14:45.734
Jake would have motive
to seek revenge.


1099
01:14:45.828 --> 01:14:48.829
- Is there anywhere else
you can stay until we find him?


1100
01:14:48.981 --> 01:14:51.165
- I'm not leaving.

1101
01:14:51.392 --> 01:14:52.816
- Listen, I don't have
the manpower to have


1102
01:14:52.835 --> 01:14:54.727
an officer here to watch you.

1103
01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.320
Best I can do is
give you my cell, okay?


1104
01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.231
You can call me directly
if anything else should happen.


1105
01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.175
- Thank you.
- Of course.


1106
01:15:03.587 --> 01:15:06.739
- Look, we can't tell you
what to do,


1107
01:15:06.757 --> 01:15:08.908
but we would strongly advise
against you staying here.


1108
01:16:38.775 --> 01:16:40.757
- What the...

1109
01:16:40.851 --> 01:16:42.851
What happened to the batteries?

1110
01:16:46.449 --> 01:16:48.023
- Olivia, hey.

1111
01:16:48.175 --> 01:16:49.950
Oh, my God!

1112
01:16:51.621 --> 01:16:53.512
- Hey, hey, hey!

1113
01:16:53.605 --> 01:16:55.197
I'm so sorry.
I heard about Agnes.


1114
01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:57.866
I just wanted to check on you.

1115
01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.034
What is wrong?

1116
01:16:59.128 --> 01:17:00.961
- You stay away from me!

1117
01:17:01.188 --> 01:17:02.463
- What?

1118
01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.706
Olivia, I was just
checking on you guys!


1119
01:17:18.873 --> 01:17:20.372
<i>
- Hansen.</i>

1120
01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:22.149
Jake's here.

1121
01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:24.209
<i>
- Olivia?</i>

1122
01:17:24.303 --> 01:17:26.378
- Jake's here.
He just broke the window.


1123
01:17:26.397 --> 01:17:27.880
<i>
- Okay, I'm sending someone now.</i>

1124
01:17:27.898 --> 01:17:29.398
<i>Find a safe place to hide, okay?</i>

1125
01:17:29.492 --> 01:17:30.991
- Just hurry.

1126
01:17:54.183 --> 01:17:56.425
- Jake, Jake?

1127
01:17:56.519 --> 01:18:00.429
Oh, my...no, no.

1128
01:18:00.523 --> 01:18:02.690
Oh, my God.
Please be alive.


1129
01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:06.861
No.

1130
01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:12.758
Ah!

1131
01:18:14.519 --> 01:18:15.536
No.

1132
01:18:22.103 --> 01:18:25.713
No, no, no!

1133
01:18:31.203 --> 01:18:32.945
- I should have killed
you before!


1134
01:18:32.963 --> 01:18:35.556
- Ah!
- Your father ruined my life!


1135
01:18:35.783 --> 01:18:38.058
And now I'm gonna take yours.

1136
01:18:40.062 --> 01:18:42.062
Jake?

1137
01:18:46.885 --> 01:18:48.293
Ahh!

1138
01:19:02.309 --> 01:19:03.976
- Jake?

1139
01:19:08.649 --> 01:19:10.165
Just relax.
Just relax.


1140
01:19:10.317 --> 01:19:11.667
The police are on their way.

1141
01:19:11.819 --> 01:19:14.577
- Okay, yeah, great, good.
- Oh, my God.


1142
01:19:14.672 --> 01:19:16.338
Why were you in the neighbors'
backyard the other day?


1143
01:19:16.432 --> 01:19:18.006
Agnes saw you.

1144
01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.825
- Oh, my God.

1145
01:19:22.346 --> 01:19:24.087
Your mom told me about the owl.

1146
01:19:24.106 --> 01:19:26.106
She said it might be your dad,

1147
01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:28.167
so I just wanted
to take a picture for her.


1148
01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.352
- Oh, my mom and that owl.

1149
01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:32.595
Yeah.

1150
01:19:32.615 --> 01:19:34.673
Wait, so you're telling me
you didn't know


1151
01:19:34.692 --> 01:19:36.283
about your father's lawsuit
against my dad?


1152
01:19:36.435 --> 01:19:38.193
- What? No.

1153
01:19:38.345 --> 01:19:41.455
No, Olivia, my dad...
He's not the nicest guy.


1154
01:19:41.606 --> 01:19:43.015
And to tell you the truth,

1155
01:19:43.033 --> 01:19:44.941
I haven't talked to him
in, like, two years.


1156
01:19:44.961 --> 01:19:47.035
- I'm so sorry
I ever doubted you.


1157
01:19:47.188 --> 01:19:48.203
- I'm sorry I broke your window.

1158
01:19:48.297 --> 01:19:50.464
I saw that guy...

1159
01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:51.948
- Yeah.

1160
01:19:55.379 --> 01:19:57.471
- Police!

1161
01:19:57.622 --> 01:20:00.032
- Police!
- Nobody move!


1162
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:02.868
- We're in here.
- Right here.


1163
01:20:02.886 --> 01:20:05.628
- Over there.
- Yep.


1164
01:20:05.648 --> 01:20:08.040
- You good?
You guys good?


1165
01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:09.316
You okay?

1166
01:20:09.543 --> 01:20:11.134
- He's hurt.

1167
01:20:11.228 --> 01:20:13.228
- I took a little bit
of shot, yeah.


1168
01:20:13.322 --> 01:20:14.637
- We'll take care of it.

1169
01:20:14.732 --> 01:20:16.715
Can we get some medics
in here, please?


1170
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.020
- Winters' gonna be okay?

1171
01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:47.337
- They said he has a concussion,

1172
01:20:47.356 --> 01:20:49.097
but he should be okay.

1173
01:20:49.191 --> 01:20:50.766
- That's good.

1174
01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.434
Oh, Detective Hansen
wanted me to tell you


1175
01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:54.511
to meet him upstairs.

1176
01:20:54.605 --> 01:20:55.863
There's something
he wants you to see.


1177
01:21:04.206 --> 01:21:06.615
- Well, I think we found
how your perpetrator


1178
01:21:06.767 --> 01:21:08.767
got in the house so easily.

1179
01:21:08.786 --> 01:21:11.045
- Okay.

1180
01:21:11.272 --> 01:21:13.272
- When was the last time
you were up there?


1181
01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:15.365
- Not since I was little.

1182
01:21:15.384 --> 01:21:17.367
Mom and Dad said that it was
dangerous, so I never went in.


1183
01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:19.127
There's nothing up there.

1184
01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:21.722
- Oh, really?

1185
01:21:21.949 --> 01:21:23.131
- Yeah.

1186
01:21:23.284 --> 01:21:25.225
- After you.

1187
01:21:25.452 --> 01:21:27.286
- Okay.

1188
01:21:44.655 --> 01:21:48.990
Ugh, what's that smell?

1189
01:21:49.085 --> 01:21:50.475
- Well, we believe

1190
01:21:50.494 --> 01:21:51.993
the perpetrator
had been living up here.


1191
01:21:52.146 --> 01:21:54.421
- Living up here?
How long?


1192
01:21:54.573 --> 01:21:57.482
- I don't know exactly.
Months?


1193
01:21:57.501 --> 01:21:58.817
But the night your mom
fell down the stairs,


1194
01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:00.152
we think she surprised him.

1195
01:22:02.489 --> 01:22:04.673
- What about Agnes?

1196
01:22:04.825 --> 01:22:07.326
- Neighbor who saw too much?

1197
01:22:07.419 --> 01:22:09.678
- Yeah, yeah,
he probably heard us


1198
01:22:09.772 --> 01:22:12.681
talking about her giving me
the security cameras.


1199
01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:14.441
- Yeah, it was likely
your delivery man.


1200
01:22:14.593 --> 01:22:16.335
He must've killed Miss Kretchner

1201
01:22:16.428 --> 01:22:18.186
just before you bumped into him.

1202
01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.188
- Poor Agnes.

1203
01:22:20.282 --> 01:22:22.858
- Hey, this isn't your fault.

1204
01:22:22.952 --> 01:22:25.435
- Who is this guy?

1205
01:22:25.529 --> 01:22:28.697
- Does the name Peter Rawlings
mean anything to you?


1206
01:22:28.849 --> 01:22:31.366
- Yeah, yes, from the news.

1207
01:22:31.518 --> 01:22:34.536
- Yeah, he was also a client
of your father's, disgruntled.


1208
01:22:34.688 --> 01:22:36.371
Claims he lost everything
because of the way


1209
01:22:36.523 --> 01:22:38.281
your dad handled his money.

1210
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.634
And when he says everything,
he literally means everything.


1211
01:22:40.861 --> 01:22:43.637
Money, house, wife, kids,
his whole life.


1212
01:22:43.864 --> 01:22:46.623
And his logic: he wanted
to make your father suffer


1213
01:22:46.642 --> 01:22:50.202
just as much as he did,
so he targeted your family,


1214
01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:54.297
made himself a nice little home
up here to plot his revenge.


1215
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:56.041
Is that familiar?

1216
01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:58.468
- This is my dad's phone.

1217
01:22:58.487 --> 01:23:01.229
I recognize the case.

1218
01:23:01.382 --> 01:23:03.548
He used this
to call my mom with.


1219
01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:07.719
And I guess
that explains the fridge.


1220
01:23:07.738 --> 01:23:09.721
- Fridge?

1221
01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.391
- Yeah, I just...I kept
finding it left open.


1222
01:23:12.409 --> 01:23:15.227
- Well, you should understand,
if it wasn't for you,


1223
01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.079
we might not have
caught this guy.


1224
01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:21.175
- Thank you.
- Of course.


1225
01:23:21.402 --> 01:23:22.843
And one more thing,

1226
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:26.329
and I'm sorry to say this,
but you might wanna make


1227
01:23:26.348 --> 01:23:28.831
a list of potential enemies
your father had.


1228
01:23:28.851 --> 01:23:31.834
Just be cautious
going forward, huh?


1229
01:23:31.854 --> 01:23:33.929
- Actually, I think
I've figured out a way


1230
01:23:34.081 --> 01:23:35.430
to handle all that.

1231
01:23:57.287 --> 01:24:02.107
- Okay, where's this guy going?

1232
01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:03.625
- Right there.
- Right here?


1233
01:24:03.777 --> 01:24:04.960
- Yeah.
- Okay.


1234
01:24:07.389 --> 01:24:09.130
- Well, I hope
that's where you wanted it.


1235
01:24:09.225 --> 01:24:11.616
- Oh, that?
That is perfect.


1236
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:13.543
- Come on, girls.
We ain't done yet.


1237
01:24:13.637 --> 01:24:15.712
But I'm tired.

1238
01:24:15.806 --> 01:24:18.548
- Aww, how 'bout lunch then?
I saw a deli around the corner.


1239
01:24:18.567 --> 01:24:21.793
- And it's really good.
And it's my treat.


1240
01:24:21.886 --> 01:24:23.979
- Oh, no, no, no, I got it.

1241
01:24:24.073 --> 01:24:27.074
Don't you worry about it.
I'll be right back.


1242
01:24:31.989 --> 01:24:34.139
- I have been meaning
to tell you...


1243
01:24:34.157 --> 01:24:35.490
- Yeah?

1244
01:24:35.642 --> 01:24:37.993
- I signed the paperwork
yesterday.


1245
01:24:38.087 --> 01:24:41.329
The house is officially sold.

1246
01:24:41.482 --> 01:24:43.164
- That's good, yeah.

1247
01:24:43.317 --> 01:24:45.650
We can finally pay back all
those people that Dad wronged.


1248
01:24:45.744 --> 01:24:50.264
- And pay for you
to finish grad school.


1249
01:24:50.491 --> 01:24:53.082
- Mom, no,
that's the whole reason


1250
01:24:53.102 --> 01:24:55.752
Dad took all that money
from those people.


1251
01:24:55.771 --> 01:25:00.256
- I know that... now.

1252
01:25:00.276 --> 01:25:01.666
But there's enough money

1253
01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:04.185
from the sale
of that house to do both.


1254
01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.928
And I know that's what

1255
01:25:05.948 --> 01:25:07.614
your father would have wanted
more than anything.


1256
01:25:09.618 --> 01:25:12.677
So let's give it to him, okay?

1257
01:25:12.696 --> 01:25:14.346
- Okay.

1258
01:25:16.941 --> 01:25:19.534
You know, this is where
the good memories lie,


1259
01:25:19.628 --> 01:25:21.295
not in that house.

1260
01:25:25.359 --> 01:25:28.860
- Thank you, Liv,
for everything.


1261
01:25:30.697 --> 01:25:32.547
I'm so proud of you, honey.

1262
01:25:32.641 --> 01:25:35.309
And I know your father
would have been also.


1263
01:25:35.536 --> 01:25:37.035
I love you.

1264
01:25:37.054 --> 01:25:39.037
- I love you, too, Mom.

1265
01:25:42.818 --> 01:25:45.393
Look at this picture.

1266
01:25:45.546 --> 01:25:48.638
- Oh, remember, you were
so upset with us that day.


1267
01:25:48.657 --> 01:25:50.139
- I didn't want
to take the photo.


1268
01:25:50.159 --> 01:25:51.883
- Oh, do you remember
the pigeon?


1269
01:25:51.976 --> 01:25:53.476
- No, you guys made me
take the photo.
