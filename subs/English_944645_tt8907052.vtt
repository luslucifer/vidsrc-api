1
00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:28.413
Mr. Heathcliff?

2
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.351
I'm Lockwood, your
new tenant, sir,


3
00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.519
at Thrushcross Grange.

4
00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.522
I'll do myself the honor of
calling as soon as possible.


5
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.875
I hope I've not inconvenienced
you in my arrival.


6
00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:30.509
I should not allow
anyone to inconvenience me


7
00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:31.577
if I could hinder it.

8
00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.702
I do wonder why you
should select the thick


9
00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.705
of a storm to ramble about in.

10
00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:21.359
From Thy bounty, through
Christ our Lord, amen.


11
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:16.514
I don't think
it possible for me


12
00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:18.550
to get home without a guide.

13
00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:21.486
Perhaps you could
spare one of your lads.


14
00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.756
No, I could not.

15
00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:27.994
I don't keep accommodations
for strangers.


16
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.562
I shall sleep in a chair.

17
00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.430
A stranger is a stranger.

18
00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.166
If you wish to stay,
you can share a bed


19
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.534
with either Hareton or Joseph.

20
00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:43.508
Let this be a lesson
for you, Mr. Lockwood,


21
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:45.912
to not go on any more
ramblings on the moors.


22
00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.749
I can go with him
as far as the park.


23
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.051
It would be hell.

24
00:07:03.622 --> 00:07:04.623
Follow me.

25
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.902
Mind the candle, and
don't make a noise.


26
00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:53.739
My master has an odd
notion about this room.


27
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.025
Have a good night, sir.

28
00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:23.983
I'm so alone.

29
00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:30.756
Cathy?

30
00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.026
You, out now.

31
00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:48.474
Don't leave.

32
00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.348
Come back to me.

33
00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:00.352
Come back.

34
00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:18.404
This whole house is swarming
with ghosts and goblins.


35
00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:20.105
If that little fiend
would have gotten in,


36
00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:22.174
she would have strangled
me, snatched my soul away.


37
00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:28.013
I'm not a fanciful man,
ma'am, nor a dishonest one.


38
00:12:30.215 --> 00:12:31.584
I saw her with my own eyes,

39
00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.353
and felt her with
my very own hands.


40
00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:36.989
Who was she?

41
00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:42.561
You have lived in
this neighborhood


42
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.097
a considerable
time, have you not?


43
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.965
All my life, sir.

44
00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.534
First here, and
then at the grange,


45
00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:50.035
when my mistress was married.

46
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.303
The master retained
me for his housekeeper


47
00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:52.572
till he passed away.

48
00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:56.442
Followed my second
mistress here.


49
00:12:56.475 --> 00:13:00.179
Indeed, then you have seen
a good many alterations.


50
00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.247
Aye, and a lot
of troubles too.


51
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.185
You knew her?

52
00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:09.888
This, Cathy.

53
00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:16.161
And Mr. Heathcliff,
he knew her as well?


54
00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.133
He loved her, dare I say.

55
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.207
He is a rather churlish man.

56
00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:31.043
He must have led
a tumultuous life


57
00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.878
to make him such a rough fellow.

58
00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:38.917
Do you know anything
of his history?


59
00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:43.188
I know all about
it, Mr. Lockwood,


60
00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:45.124
save for the
circumstances of his birth


61
00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.493
and how he got his fortune.

62
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.666
It would be a
charitable deed to tell me


63
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.268
something of my
neighbors, Miss Dean.


64
00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:58.237
It's not a joyous tale.

65
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.472
There's not room for
smiles and laughter


66
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.241
so much, just tears and remorse.

67
00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:08.414
I should like
to hear it still.


68
00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:20.959
30 years ago, when I took
over my mother's position


69
00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:23.195
as housekeeper at
Wuthering Heights,


70
00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:26.498
Mr. Earnshaw, Cathy's father,

71
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.967
was to return from
Liverpool that evening.


72
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:30.737
We all eagerly
awaited his arrival


73
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.105
because he was to bring
a present for all of us.


74
00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:36.508
A riding whip for Cathy, a
fiddle for brother Hindley.


75
00:14:38.645 --> 00:14:40.179
Your brother is studying.

76
00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.383
And some
apples and pears for me.


77
00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.051
Papa, Papa.

78
00:14:46.084 --> 00:14:48.153
Papa, we're so
glad you came home.


79
00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:50.088
I can see that.

80
00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:50.924
Oh.

81
00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.157
Catherine, give
your father a rest.


82
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.292
He's had a long journey.

83
00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:54.594
Oh, oh oh oh.

84
00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:56.596
Come.

85
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.204
I brought you something.

86
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.071
What
did you bring me?


87
00:15:06.104 --> 00:15:07.206
See here.

88
00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:15.314
Oh, what is it?

89
00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:16.315
A gift from God.

90
00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:18.651
A gift from the
devil, more like it.


91
00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:19.752
Quiet, girl.

92
00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:22.287
I found him starving in
the streets of Liverpool.


93
00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.591
It was the Christian thing
to do to bring him home.


94
00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:27.125
How can you fashion
to bring this gypsy brat


95
00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.261
into our home when we
have our own children


96
00:15:29.294 --> 00:15:30.496
to feed and care for?

97
00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:31.764
I couldn't let him starve.

98
00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:34.299
Why not? Tends to
be what his kind do.


99
00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:38.337
What's so special about
this dodgy foundling?


100
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.306
He's not my blood any
more than he is yours,


101
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.344
but he will be our son and
Hindley and Cathy's brother.


102
00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:48.648
An easy
conversion, no doubt.


103
00:15:58.524 --> 00:15:59.358
Cathy.

104
00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:04.597
Do you want to know
what I brought for you?


105
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:05.765
Yes.

106
00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.604
I brought you Heathcliff.

107
00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.706
Heathcliff? Heathcliff?

108
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.345
You've named this
after our brother?


109
00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:22.514
It is a befitting name.

110
00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:25.685
You hardly knew your brother,

111
00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:29.221
and Cathy was only a twinkle
in my eye when he passed.


112
00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:35.394
Nelly, wash him and
find him some clothes.


113
00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:39.231
The rest of us, will go to bed.

114
00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:55.615
Come on.

115
00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:01.721
Dear God, thank
you for your mercy,


116
00:17:03.623 --> 00:17:06.325
and thank you for this bounty
we are about to receive.


117
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.165
And dear God, thank you for
the gift of Heathcliff, amen.


118
00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:17.302
Amen.

119
00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:25.110
Here.

120
00:17:29.247 --> 00:17:30.349
It'll make you strong.

121
00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:32.417
Eat it up.

122
00:17:33.418 --> 00:17:35.354
Here, put this in your lap.

123
00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.690
Neat and tidy, huh?

124
00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.431
From
the very beginning


125
00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:48.568
Heathcliff bred bad
feelings in the house.


126
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.338
Two years later,
Mrs. Earnshaw died,


127
00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:55.207
without ever seeing
Heathcliff as anything


128
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.342
but her husband's
ill-begotten bastard.


129
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:08.821
After the mistress' death,
Hindley began to view his father


130
00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:10.623
as an oppressor
rather than a friend,


131
00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:14.292
and Heathcliff as an usurper
of his father's affections.


132
00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:15.527
That's right, keep
that nice and clean.


133
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.830
Otherwise, the
powder will ignite.


134
00:18:17.864 --> 00:18:21.266
Very good. Now, see if you
can put that back down.


135
00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:21.934
That's it.

136
00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:26.538
That's right, now
hold this up here.


137
00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:29.274
All right, pull this out.
Go ahead and pull that out.


138
00:18:29.307 --> 00:18:31.376
And ram it down inside that.

139
00:18:47.492 --> 00:18:50.630
Heathcliff and
Cathy became inseparable.


140
00:18:50.663 --> 00:18:52.564
There wasn't a
place where one went


141
00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.399
where the other didn't follow.

142
00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:22.028
You're a dirty
gypsy, Heathcliff.


143
00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.630
I hate you.

144
00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:33.573
Finally, Arcure
advised Mr. Earnshaw


145
00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:34.941
to send Hindley to college.

146
00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:42.514
Mr. Earnshaw agreed, but
he never thought Hindley


147
00:19:42.547 --> 00:19:44.617
would thrive, no matter
where he wandered.


148
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.686
I never believed.

149
00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:50.455
I was the only one who
truly cared for Hindley.


150
00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:52.524
Until the night
of his departure,


151
00:19:52.557 --> 00:19:53.793
it seemed I would
be the only one


152
00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:55.460
who would regret his absence.

153
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:14.279
Cathy?

154
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.686
Why can't you always
be a good lass?


155
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:25.290
Why can't you always
be a good man, Father?


156
00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.699
Father?

157
00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.034
Father?

158
00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.002
Time for bed.

159
00:20:36.035 --> 00:20:36.869
Nelly!

160
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.808
Day for your prayers, Mister.

161
00:20:47.647 --> 00:20:49.381
Mr. Earnshaw.

162
00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:50.515
Mr. Earnshaw?

163
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:01.526
Cathy.

164
00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:06.364
Heathcliff, take Cathy
to bed. Back to bed.


165
00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.633
Fetch Dr. Kenneth.

166
00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:38.631
You'll always be
Catherine Heathcliff.


167
00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:39.497
Forever.

168
00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:48.540
Tell me, Heathcliff,
where did you come from?


169
00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:50.576
I don't remember.

170
00:21:52.879 --> 00:21:54.814
I don't remember
anything before you.


171
00:21:57.583 --> 00:21:59.819
I think you're a
prince in disguise.


172
00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.522
Your father was the
emperor of China,


173
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:09.494
and your mother was
an Indian queen.


174
00:22:09.527 --> 00:22:11.631
And you were kidnapped
by wicked sailors


175
00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.531
and brought to England.

176
00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.439
You're worried
everything will change


177
00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:23.541
once Hindley
returns, aren't you?


178
00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:28.080
Well, with Father dead,
he does own the Heights.


179
00:22:28.114 --> 00:22:31.150
I won't have much to
protect me but my own wits.


180
00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:32.585
I shall protect you.

181
00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:36.856
My brother won't touch a
single black hair on your head.


182
00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:42.662
No one dare try to
take you away from me.


183
00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.433
Nor you from me.

184
00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:52.605
Hurry.

185
00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:53.065
No parson in the
world ever pictured heaven


186
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.900
so beautifully as they did.

187
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.536
And I could not help wishing

188
00:23:58.571 --> 00:24:00.840
we were all there safe together.

189
00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:20.726
After his schooling,
Mr. Hindley came home


190
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.163
and set the neighbors
gossiping, right, left.


191
00:24:46.252 --> 00:24:47.787
He brought a wife with him.

192
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.255
Heathcliff.

193
00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:52.024
What she was
and where she was born...


194
00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:52.958
The horses.

195
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:55.194
He never informed us.

196
00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:05.304
She had neither money nor
name to recommend her,


197
00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:09.942
or he would scarcely have kept
that union from his father.


198
00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:32.932
Young Earnshaw was
altered considerably


199
00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:34.667
in the years of his absence.

200
00:25:36.836 --> 00:25:39.071
Hello, Catherine. This
is my wife, Frances.


201
00:25:39.105 --> 00:25:40.673
Isn't this charming?

202
00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:43.242
This is my sister Catherine,
our housekeeper Nelly,


203
00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.944
and that was Joseph.

204
00:25:44.977 --> 00:25:46.745
Welcome to Wuthering
Heights, ma'am.


205
00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:48.848
Cathy, Hindley's told
me so much about you.


206
00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:50.816
I've always wanted a
sister of my very own,


207
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.785
and now I have one.

208
00:25:52.818 --> 00:25:54.286
Oh, why don't you
show me around?


209
00:26:02.161 --> 00:26:03.863
From now on,
Nelly, you and Joseph are


210
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:07.199
to stay in the servants'
quarters, where you belong.


211
00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:08.901
Of course, master.

212
00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:11.937
And as for you, Heathcliff,

213
00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:16.876
no more curate, and
stay in the stables.


214
00:26:17.643 --> 00:26:19.879
My wife and I want the
house to ourselves.


215
00:26:29.221 --> 00:26:32.258
Hindley
became tyrannical,


216
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:35.461
evincing a dislike
to Heathcliff.


217
00:26:35.494 --> 00:26:38.197
He drove him from their
company to the servants',


218
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.166
deprived him of education,

219
00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:42.768
and insisted that he
should labor out of doors.


220
00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:06.358
It's horrible what
Hindley's done to you.


221
00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.931
Things will get better.

222
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:14.900
It'll be all right.

223
00:27:14.934 --> 00:27:17.203
You do trust me, don't you?

224
00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:22.041
Of course.

225
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.113
Good. Well then.

226
00:27:30.216 --> 00:27:32.084
I'm going to read to you.

227
00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:41.227
Where we were?

228
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.828
Heathcliff
bore his degradation


229
00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:44.363
fairly well at first,

230
00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.932
because Cathy taught
him what she learnt


231
00:27:46.966 --> 00:27:49.034
and worked or played
with him in the fields.


232
00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:53.973
They both promised fair to
grow up as unruly savages.


233
00:27:54.907 --> 00:27:57.409
The young master being
entirely negligent


234
00:27:57.443 --> 00:27:59.545
how they behaved
and what they did,


235
00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:01.547
so they kept clear of him.

236
00:28:01.581 --> 00:28:04.049
It was one of their chief
amusements to run away


237
00:28:04.083 --> 00:28:07.353
to the moors in the morning
and remain there all day.


238
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.991
They forgot everything the
minute they were together again.


239
00:28:13.593 --> 00:28:16.862
To seek revenge,
but leave a place


240
00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:18.831
for divine retribution.

241
00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:22.101
Never pay back evil for evil.

242
00:28:23.836 --> 00:28:27.806
Let your ills be such as
all men kept honorable.


243
00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:34.413
If possible, live at
peace with all men.


244
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:42.454
What? Done already?

245
00:28:42.488 --> 00:28:44.323
I think
that's enough for today.


246
00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:47.126
When Father was
alive, we were permitted


247
00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:47.993
to play on Sundays.

248
00:28:48.027 --> 00:28:51.263
I don't give a
damn what Father did.


249
00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:55.267
This is my house
now. I am master.


250
00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:57.136
Hindley, let them be.

251
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:59.938
If they want to run around
like savages, let them.


252
00:29:03.175 --> 00:29:04.276
Fine, off with you then.

253
00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:29.535
Here, look.

254
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:39.011
It's beautiful, Heathcliff.

255
00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:05.437
That evening,
Hindley, in a passion,


256
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:07.039
told us to bolt the doors

257
00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:09.541
and swore nobody should
let them in that night.


258
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:13.245
The household went to
bed, but I was determined


259
00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:15.981
to admit them in spite
of the prohibition,


260
00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.082
once they returned.

261
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.052
Heathcliff, look.

262
00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:22.888
There's marigold at the grange.

263
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.060
I wonder how the Lintons
pass their Sunday evenings.


264
00:30:28.093 --> 00:30:30.129
Standing around
shivering in corners


265
00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:32.498
while the help burn their
eyes out by the fire.


266
00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:43.710
Cathy.

267
00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:50.516
Thrushcross Grange.

268
00:30:52.184 --> 00:30:56.355
Your new home, Mr. Lockwood,
was once home to the Lintons,


269
00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.291
a proud family of landed gentry.

270
00:31:03.362 --> 00:31:06.131
Old Mr. Linton had
long since passed,


271
00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:10.536
but he left two spirited
children, Isabella and Edgar.


272
00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:21.246
They had all the grange
entirely to themselves.


273
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.148
Shouldn't they have been happy?

274
00:31:23.182 --> 00:31:25.384
We should have thought
ourselves in heaven.


275
00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:43.168
And now, guess what those
good children were doing.


276
00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:47.072
Livelier,
Isabella, livelier.


277
00:31:54.781 --> 00:31:56.348
Livelier.

278
00:32:02.187 --> 00:32:05.658
Don't you wish you had
been adopted by the Lintons?


279
00:32:10.797 --> 00:32:11.931
Livelier, live...

280
00:32:11.965 --> 00:32:14.801
I am playing it lively. You
sit down and play it then.


281
00:32:19.538 --> 00:32:21.406
There's
somebody out there.


282
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.175
They haven't seen us.

283
00:32:23.208 --> 00:32:24.076
Men!

284
00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:33.620
Heathcliff!

285
00:32:38.825 --> 00:32:41.493
Heathcliff, bring her in here.

286
00:32:41.527 --> 00:32:43.128
You can lay her right there.

287
00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:45.464
I have sent one of my
men for Dr. Kenneth.


288
00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:47.299
He will be here within the hour.

289
00:32:48.601 --> 00:32:50.335
Miss, where does it hurt?

290
00:32:50.369 --> 00:32:52.304
Don't don't, don't
touch her. Please, please.


291
00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:55.240
Sir.

292
00:32:55.274 --> 00:32:59.278
No no, no no. Don't
touch her please.


293
00:32:59.311 --> 00:33:00.345
Please.

294
00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:01.246
Sir.

295
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.081
Get away.

296
00:33:03.115 --> 00:33:05.083
Sir, if you cannot
behave civilized,


297
00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:07.286
then I will have to
ask you to leave.


298
00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:09.288
If you're not
sure, we'll wait for the doctor.


299
00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:12.257
Fine.

300
00:33:14.126 --> 00:33:15.595
But I can't leave Cathy here.

301
00:33:17.129 --> 00:33:19.197
Let me tend to her.

302
00:33:19.231 --> 00:33:20.499
Please, no, please. Please.

303
00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:24.169
Seamus.

304
00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:26.839
Your presence,
sire, is no longer required.


305
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.084
Do not worry.

306
00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:41.453
She will be well taken care of.

307
00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:46.659
She will be well cared for.

308
00:33:53.633 --> 00:33:57.536
Look
at the state of her.


309
00:34:00.339 --> 00:34:01.239
I need to have.

310
00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:02.541
My word.

311
00:34:02.575 --> 00:34:03.910
I shall have to talk
to Hindley Earnshaw


312
00:34:03.943 --> 00:34:05.344
about his gypsy brother.

313
00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:17.857
Perhaps she would benefit
from staying here for a while.


314
00:36:08.768 --> 00:36:12.872
Cathy stayed at
Thrushcross Grange five weeks.


315
00:36:12.905 --> 00:36:15.575
By that time, her ankle
was thoroughly cured


316
00:36:15.608 --> 00:36:17.977
and her manners much improved.

317
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:20.646
Mr. Linton commenced a
plan of reform by raising


318
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.316
her self-respect with
fine clothes and flattery,


319
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.685
which she readily took.

320
00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:30.422
Remember, Heathcliff,
if I am to allow you


321
00:36:30.455 --> 00:36:33.626
to stay here at the Heights,
you are not to speak to Cathy.


322
00:36:36.662 --> 00:36:38.865
Not unless it
involves her horse.


323
00:36:54.113 --> 00:36:55.915
Brother.

324
00:36:55.948 --> 00:37:00.653
So that, instead of
a wild hapless little sage,


325
00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:05.557
there lighted a very
dignified person.


326
00:37:05.591 --> 00:37:07.359
Oh, Heathcliff,
you may come forward


327
00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:08.995
and wish Miss Cathy welcome.

328
00:37:10.562 --> 00:37:11.664
Heathcliff.

329
00:37:14.934 --> 00:37:16.334
Have you forgotten all about me?

330
00:37:16.368 --> 00:37:18.370
Shake hands with
her, Heathcliff.


331
00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.072
Surely that's permitted.

332
00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:25.011
Heathcliff,
what have you been


333
00:37:25.044 --> 00:37:26.612
doing with yourself?

334
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.620
I won't stand
to be laughed at.


335
00:37:34.654 --> 00:37:37.322
I didn't mean to laugh.
I couldn't handle myself.


336
00:37:38.557 --> 00:37:39.992
Look how dirty you are.

337
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.001
You look lovely, Cath.

338
00:37:56.108 --> 00:37:59.544
And on that note,
let's go in, shall we?


339
00:38:06.886 --> 00:38:09.655
May I present a toast
to our guests the Lintons.


340
00:38:09.689 --> 00:38:13.960
Edgar, Isabella, I bid you
welcome to Wuthering Heights.


341
00:38:13.993 --> 00:38:16.629
Why thank you, Hindley.
Happy to be here.


342
00:38:17.663 --> 00:38:20.633
It's marvelous pears
this year, quite a yield.


343
00:38:35.648 --> 00:38:36.649
Nelly?

344
00:38:39.085 --> 00:38:39.919
Can you

345
00:38:41.854 --> 00:38:43.455
make me decent?

346
00:38:45.858 --> 00:38:47.860
High time time, Heathcliff.

347
00:38:47.894 --> 00:38:49.427
You know, proud
people often breed


348
00:38:49.461 --> 00:38:50.696
sad sorrows for themselves.

349
00:38:51.697 --> 00:38:54.667
I believe a few of Mr.
Earnshaw's old clothes


350
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.002
are in the attic.

351
00:38:56.035 --> 00:38:59.138
As soon as I can steal
time, I'll help you.


352
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:01.607
Edgar Linton will look
like a dog compared to you.


353
00:39:10.149 --> 00:39:12.618
What are you doing in here?

354
00:39:14.787 --> 00:39:18.891
This is a place for civilized
ladies and gentlemen,


355
00:39:18.925 --> 00:39:21.827
not for dirty gypsies.

356
00:39:33.773 --> 00:39:35.608
Wait!

357
00:39:35.641 --> 00:39:38.611
Till I take hold of those
elegant locks of yours,


358
00:39:38.644 --> 00:39:42.547
see if I can't pull them
out a little longer.


359
00:39:46.919 --> 00:39:48.621
I think they're long enough.

360
00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:51.824
Look's like a colt's
mane.


361
00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:58.664
Oh!

362
00:39:59.799 --> 00:40:01.200
No, Heathcliff!

363
00:40:10.776 --> 00:40:12.812
Back to the stables.

364
00:40:13.779 --> 00:40:14.680
Excuse us.

365
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:25.925
Fight!

366
00:40:26.792 --> 00:40:28.560
I told you to fight back!

367
00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:29.895
Now you must!

368
00:40:58.758 --> 00:41:02.862
You were no more
his son than I was.


369
00:41:16.675 --> 00:41:21.680
Joseph, I have to go give my
father's coat another brushing.


370
00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:30.890
Next time, Edgar, take
the law to your fists.


371
00:41:33.793 --> 00:41:35.560
It will give you an appetite.

372
00:41:38.998 --> 00:41:44.003
Now then, who's up
for a round of bridge?


373
00:43:09.155 --> 00:43:13.025
Heathcliff, it's for
God to punish the wicked.


374
00:43:15.895 --> 00:43:17.863
We must learn to forgive.

375
00:44:00.973 --> 00:44:04.877
On that morning, my
first bonny little nursling


376
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:08.247
and the last of the ancient
Earnshaw stock was born.


377
00:44:09.815 --> 00:44:10.449
How's the babe?

378
00:44:19.225 --> 00:44:22.194
Nearly ready to
run about, Nelly.


379
00:44:22.228 --> 00:44:23.062
And Frances?

380
00:44:27.333 --> 00:44:32.338
She'll be perfectly well
by this time next week.


381
00:44:34.106 --> 00:44:35.007
But Dr. Kenneth...

382
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.975
Damn him!

383
00:44:41.046 --> 00:44:42.948
Damn the doctor.

384
00:44:45.884 --> 00:44:47.119
I'll go and see to her.

385
00:44:51.423 --> 00:44:52.825
Where's Cathy?

386
00:44:52.858 --> 00:44:54.526
With Mr. Linton.

387
00:45:19.051 --> 00:45:20.219
He's so big.

388
00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:55.789
I'm going to name him Hareton.

389
00:45:59.358 --> 00:46:01.493
Hindley had an
ancestor named Hareton.


390
00:46:03.462 --> 00:46:06.165
It is a good family name.

391
00:46:06.198 --> 00:46:07.199
Happy mum.

392
00:46:11.103 --> 00:46:16.108
Hareton Earnshaw, promise me
you'll look after him, Nelly.


393
00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:22.582
You'll love him like your own.

394
00:46:24.483 --> 00:46:26.485
Oh, it was
such a grand bairn.


395
00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:29.455
The finest lad
that ever breathed.


396
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:35.961
And, Frances, she'd been in
consumption for many months.


397
00:46:35.994 --> 00:46:38.130
She had nothing to keep her.

398
00:46:38.163 --> 00:46:40.065
The other side.
The other side.


399
00:46:40.099 --> 00:46:41.934
You going somewhere?

400
00:46:41.967 --> 00:46:42.602
No.

401
00:46:46.305 --> 00:46:48.575
What do you got that
silly frock on for then?


402
00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:54.279
Edgar Linton's supposed
to call here this afternoon.


403
00:46:55.214 --> 00:46:56.482
Edgar Linton.

404
00:47:00.085 --> 00:47:02.488
Catherine and he
were constant companions,


405
00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:05.224
still, at his seasons
of respite from labor.


406
00:47:06.225 --> 00:47:08.227
That's six weeks in a
row you've turned me out


407
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.296
for that pitiful
friend of yours again.


408
00:47:12.632 --> 00:47:14.601
What have you got there?

409
00:47:14.634 --> 00:47:15.769
Oh, that's very foolish.

410
00:47:15.802 --> 00:47:18.937
As if I were to take notice.
Where's the sense in that?


411
00:47:18.971 --> 00:47:21.608
To show you that
I take notice.


412
00:47:23.342 --> 00:47:25.544
Here, look. Look here.

413
00:47:29.081 --> 00:47:31.216
But he ceased
to express his fondness


414
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:35.487
for her in words, and
recoiled with angry suspicion


415
00:47:35.521 --> 00:47:37.122
from her girlish caresses.

416
00:47:37.156 --> 00:47:39.425
Every mark here
is a mark that you


417
00:47:39.458 --> 00:47:41.960
have spent with Linton.

418
00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:43.596
These marks are days with me.

419
00:47:48.635 --> 00:47:50.169
Must I always
be simple to you?


420
00:47:52.772 --> 00:47:55.974
You might be dumb for anything
you say to amuse me.


421
00:47:59.178 --> 00:48:02.147
As if conscious, there
could be no gratification


422
00:48:02.181 --> 00:48:04.617
in lavishing such marks
of affection on him.


423
00:48:06.118 --> 00:48:09.288
Never knew that
I talked too little


424
00:48:09.321 --> 00:48:11.190
that you disliked
my company, Cathy.


425
00:48:12.625 --> 00:48:15.294
There's no company at all
when people know nothing.


426
00:48:15.327 --> 00:48:16.528
Say nothing.

427
00:48:59.204 --> 00:49:00.740
Heathcliff!

428
00:49:16.221 --> 00:49:17.256
Where is my son?

429
00:49:17.289 --> 00:49:18.323
Sh.

430
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.629
He's right here, Mr. Hindley.

431
00:49:22.662 --> 00:49:23.796
Well then, let me hold him.

432
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:25.264
You're too drunk.

433
00:49:25.297 --> 00:49:26.733
I'm his father. I'm
not going to hurt him.


434
00:49:26.766 --> 00:49:31.103
You're a drunkard and a
poor excuse for a father.


435
00:49:47.185 --> 00:49:48.320
It's all right, Heathcliff.

436
00:49:48.353 --> 00:49:51.523
You can take a moment before
you return to the stables.


437
00:49:51.557 --> 00:49:54.092
Just remember to brush
them before you turn in.


438
00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.497
One more thing, don't
tell Mr. Hindley.


439
00:50:03.535 --> 00:50:04.336
Nelly.

440
00:50:07.807 --> 00:50:09.508
Your tongue has grown
rather sharp of late, Nelly.


441
00:50:09.541 --> 00:50:11.510
Get your hands off of me.

442
00:50:14.279 --> 00:50:16.548
I never noticed
what a woman you are.


443
00:50:16.583 --> 00:50:18.417
Now's not the
time to take notice.


444
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:22.387
I could kill you for
speaking back to me.


445
00:50:24.556 --> 00:50:29.294
Don't listen then. I
have to know my place.


446
00:50:53.485 --> 00:50:57.322
Catherine, our time
together has been,


447
00:50:58.691 --> 00:51:00.492
well, just lovely.

448
00:51:05.832 --> 00:51:10.837
And, I feel we should
spend more time together.


449
00:51:14.841 --> 00:51:17.810
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...


450
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:26.418
there's nothing that
would make me happier


451
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.522
than if you'd take
my hand of marriage.


452
00:52:13.365 --> 00:52:15.267
Are you alone, Nelly?

453
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.234
Yes, Miss.

454
00:52:17.003 --> 00:52:18.604
Will you keep a secret for me?

455
00:52:19.438 --> 00:52:20.539
Is it worth keeping?

456
00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:25.611
Today, Edgar Linton
asked me to marry him.


457
00:52:25.645 --> 00:52:26.511
And I accepted.

458
00:52:29.749 --> 00:52:31.550
Do you love Mr. Edgar?

459
00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:33.853
Of course I do.
Who could help it?


460
00:52:33.886 --> 00:52:35.353
Why do you love him?

461
00:52:36.756 --> 00:52:38.858
Because he's handsome
and pleasant to be with.


462
00:52:38.891 --> 00:52:40.026
Bad.

463
00:52:40.059 --> 00:52:42.461
Because he's
young and cheerful.


464
00:52:42.494 --> 00:52:43.495
Bad still.

465
00:52:45.598 --> 00:52:46.766
Because he shall be rich.

466
00:52:48.701 --> 00:52:51.571
And I shall be the greatest
woman in the neighborhood.


467
00:52:51.604 --> 00:52:53.740
Worst of all.

468
00:52:53.773 --> 00:52:55.474
You're making jest of it!

469
00:52:55.507 --> 00:52:57.375
I'm very far from making
jest of it, Miss Cathy.


470
00:52:57.409 --> 00:53:00.545
It doesn't matter what
you say. I shall marry him.


471
00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.616
Very well. Your
brother will be pleased.


472
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:06.719
You will escape a
disorderly coupleless home


473
00:53:06.753 --> 00:53:08.654
in favor of a wealthy
respectable one.


474
00:53:10.022 --> 00:53:13.726
If you love Edgar,
and Edgar loves you,


475
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.294
all will be smooth and easy.

476
00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:18.865
Where's your obstacle?

477
00:53:23.535 --> 00:53:25.370
Here, near my heart,

478
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.407
near my soul.

479
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:34.013
I'm convinced I'm doing wrong.

480
00:53:35.748 --> 00:53:39.752
Nelly, have you ever
had bad dreams at night?


481
00:53:39.786 --> 00:53:41.020
Now and then.

482
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.424
I dreamt I was in heaven once,

483
00:53:48.094 --> 00:53:49.662
and I was miserable there.

484
00:53:51.496 --> 00:53:53.398
And I broke my
heart with weeping.


485
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:58.738
And the angels were so angry
that they thrust me out


486
00:53:58.771 --> 00:54:03.441
right into the, right on
top of Wuthering Heights.


487
00:54:05.912 --> 00:54:09.582
And I woke up sobbing for joy.

488
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.552
Don't you see, Nelly?

489
00:54:13.586 --> 00:54:15.520
I have no more right
to marry Edgar Linton


490
00:54:15.554 --> 00:54:17.790
than I have to be in heaven?

491
00:54:20.492 --> 00:54:22.762
And if Hindley had not
brought Heathcliff so low,


492
00:54:23.663 --> 00:54:25.832
I would have never
thought to marry Edgar.


493
00:54:26.799 --> 00:54:30.468
But to marry Heathcliff
now would degrade me.


494
00:54:38.845 --> 00:54:41.413
So he shall never know
how much I love him,


495
00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.618
and my great misery
seeing his world diminish.


496
00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:47.987
I have watched him run him off.

497
00:54:51.591 --> 00:54:54.827
And my great thought
in living exists.


498
00:54:54.861 --> 00:54:59.397
My love for Edgar is like
the foliage in the forest.


499
00:55:02.735 --> 00:55:06.538
Time will change it, as
winter changes the trees.


500
00:55:09.441 --> 00:55:14.146
My love for Heathcliff is like
the eternal rocks beneath.


501
00:55:15.715 --> 00:55:18.851
A source of little visible
pleasure but vital.


502
00:55:25.625 --> 00:55:27.525
I am Heathcliff, Nelly.

503
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.030
He is always, always in my mind.

504
00:55:32.632 --> 00:55:36.636
But not as a pleasure to
myself but as my own being.


505
00:55:38.104 --> 00:55:41.974
Miss Cathy, Heathcliff
might have been listening.


506
00:55:44.509 --> 00:55:49.514
He left when you said it would
do you disgrace to marry him.


507
00:55:49.949 --> 00:55:51.751
No!

508
00:55:51.784 --> 00:55:52.752
No!

509
00:55:52.785 --> 00:55:54.921
- Miss Cathy!
- Heathcliff!


510
00:56:03.729 --> 00:56:05.932
It was a very
dark evening for summer.


511
00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.670
A storm came rattling over
the Heights, full of fury.


512
00:56:12.238 --> 00:56:15.507
Catherine would not be
persuaded into tranquility.


513
00:56:16.242 --> 00:56:18.811
She kept wandering to and fro,

514
00:56:19.444 --> 00:56:21.614
heedless of the growing thunder,

515
00:56:21.647 --> 00:56:24.650
and the great drops that
began to splash around her.


516
00:56:26.886 --> 00:56:30.656
She remained,
calling at intervals,


517
00:56:31.857 --> 00:56:35.493
and then listening, and
then crying outright.


518
00:56:37.163 --> 00:56:39.732
She cried for
Heathcliff all night,


519
00:56:40.766 --> 00:56:43.803
till she was greeted by the
warmth of the rising sun.


520
00:56:46.672 --> 00:56:49.108
Where the hell have you been?

521
00:56:55.314 --> 00:56:56.148
Outside.

522
00:57:00.987 --> 00:57:02.955
Were you with Heathcliff?

523
00:57:07.126 --> 00:57:08.828
I never saw him.

524
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:11.764
Well.

525
00:57:15.167 --> 00:57:20.106
When he comes back,
I'll throw him out.


526
00:57:20.139 --> 00:57:22.241
I've had enough of
that gypsy bastard.


527
00:57:25.845 --> 00:57:27.512
You won't get
your opportunity.


528
00:57:30.683 --> 00:57:31.516
He's gone.

529
00:57:35.187 --> 00:57:36.088
I lost him.

530
00:57:38.891 --> 00:57:40.059
I've lost him.

531
00:57:43.329 --> 00:57:44.230
I lost him.

532
00:57:46.866 --> 00:57:49.068
I've lost him! 
I've lost him!

533
00:57:51.837 --> 00:57:55.107
I've lost him!

534
00:58:42.388 --> 00:58:43.823
I don't have to go.

535
00:58:43.856 --> 00:58:45.324
They have plenty of
maids at the Grange


536
00:58:45.357 --> 00:58:46.892
to take care of Miss Cathy.

537
00:58:46.926 --> 00:58:47.860
I can stay here with
you and Hareton.


538
00:58:47.893 --> 00:58:50.696
There's no use for you here.

539
00:58:52.131 --> 00:58:54.867
I want no women in this house.

540
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.335
But Hareton needs
a mother, sir.


541
00:58:56.368 --> 00:58:58.304
He had a mother. She left him.

542
00:59:00.439 --> 00:59:02.641
She left me.

543
00:59:04.143 --> 00:59:05.611
Frances loved you, sir.

544
00:59:06.679 --> 00:59:08.948
I'm sure it would break her
heart to see you like this.


545
00:59:19.892 --> 00:59:21.861
Goodbye, Angel.

546
00:59:36.275 --> 00:59:38.444
Edgar Linton
believed himself


547
00:59:38.477 --> 00:59:41.247
the happiest man alive
on the day he led


548
00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.082
Miss Cathy to Gimmerton Chapel.

549
00:59:44.016 --> 00:59:46.318
He offered me magnificent wages,

550
00:59:46.352 --> 00:59:49.188
and so I had but
one choice left,


551
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:50.422
to do as I was ordered.

552
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:54.994
And since then Hareton
has been a stranger.


553
01:01:04.063 --> 01:01:06.832
Come on, fella, come on.

554
01:01:06.865 --> 01:01:09.335
Hindley had mortgaged
every yard of land he owned


555
01:01:09.368 --> 01:01:13.105
for cash to supply his
mania for gaming, drinking,


556
01:01:13.138 --> 01:01:16.842
becoming something less than
a man, let alone a father.


557
01:01:28.988 --> 01:01:32.024
I got Miss Catherine and
myself to Thrushcross Grange,


558
01:01:32.057 --> 01:01:34.560
and to my agreeable
disappointment,


559
01:01:34.594 --> 01:01:37.496
she behaved infinitely
better than I dared expect.


560
01:01:38.397 --> 01:01:41.533
She seemed almost
overfond of Mr. Linton,


561
01:01:41.567 --> 01:01:44.436
and even to his sister she
showed plenty of affection.


562
01:01:46.138 --> 01:01:48.941
I believe I may assert that
they were really in possession


563
01:01:48.974 --> 01:01:51.110
of deep and growing happiness.

564
01:01:52.511 --> 01:01:57.483
But on a mellow evening
in September, it ended.


565
01:01:59.985 --> 01:02:04.023
His cheeks were covered,
his brows lowered.


566
01:02:08.227 --> 01:02:09.862
I remembered the eyes.

567
01:02:26.613 --> 01:02:27.446
Excuse me, sir.

568
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:30.215
Yes.

569
01:02:30.249 --> 01:02:32.451
A person from Gimmerton
wishes to see you, ma'am.


570
01:02:33.485 --> 01:02:34.520
What do they want?

571
01:02:34.553 --> 01:02:36.422
I didn't question him.

572
01:02:36.455 --> 01:02:38.457
It's not one of
Hindley's creditors, is it?


573
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:41.226
No, someone the
mistress doesn't expect.


574
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.101
Shall I continue?

575
01:02:49.134 --> 01:02:50.169
Please.

576
01:02:59.978 --> 01:03:00.979
Heathcliff.

577
01:03:09.054 --> 01:03:10.222
I thought I've
never been alive


578
01:03:10.255 --> 01:03:12.224
since the last I saw your face.

579
01:03:14.059 --> 01:03:15.127
Forgive me.

580
01:03:17.262 --> 01:03:19.331
I struggled only for you.

581
01:03:35.013 --> 01:03:36.248
Edgar, Edgar!

582
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.052
Heathcliff's come back!

583
01:03:43.088 --> 01:03:45.357
Try to be glad
without being absurd


584
01:03:45.391 --> 01:03:47.192
in front of the whole household.

585
01:03:55.367 --> 01:03:57.136
Ah, Mr. Heathcliff.

586
01:03:58.003 --> 01:04:00.105
Please, sit down.

587
01:04:05.244 --> 01:04:08.046
Mrs. Linton would have me
give you a cordial reception.


588
01:04:09.047 --> 01:04:10.949
Of course I am gratified with
anything that pleases her.


589
01:04:10.983 --> 01:04:12.685
As am I, especially
when it is anything


590
01:04:12.719 --> 01:04:14.086
in which I have a part.

591
01:04:17.222 --> 01:04:18.390
Thank you, Nelly.

592
01:04:24.563 --> 01:04:29.368
Well, tell us, where have
you been the last few years?


593
01:04:30.402 --> 01:04:31.604
Abroad?

594
01:04:31.638 --> 01:04:32.471
Yes.

595
01:04:33.773 --> 01:04:35.007
Soldiering perhaps?

596
01:04:38.177 --> 01:04:39.011
Yes.

597
01:04:40.747 --> 01:04:43.282
I shall
think it a dream tomorrow,


598
01:04:43.315 --> 01:04:45.517
to have seen and touched
and spoken to you.


599
01:04:47.152 --> 01:04:51.290
Yet, cruel Heathcliff, you
don't deserve this welcome.


600
01:04:51.323 --> 01:04:53.158
To be absent and
silent for three years


601
01:04:53.192 --> 01:04:55.093
and to never think of me.

602
01:04:55.127 --> 01:04:56.962
A little more than
you thought of me.


603
01:05:00.199 --> 01:05:02.000
I heard of your marriage.

604
01:05:04.236 --> 01:05:06.338
Where are you
staying, Gimmerton?


605
01:05:07.674 --> 01:05:08.540
No.

606
01:05:10.643 --> 01:05:11.845
At Wuthering Heights.

607
01:05:11.878 --> 01:05:14.313
Hindley Earnshaw invited you
to stay at Wuthering Heights?


608
01:05:14.346 --> 01:05:17.049
No, it is I who have
invited him to stay.


609
01:05:18.217 --> 01:05:19.652
Seems Hindley
mortgaged the property


610
01:05:19.686 --> 01:05:21.520
to pay for his gambling debts.

611
01:05:23.088 --> 01:05:26.225
I managed to help my
brother with his finances.


612
01:05:26.258 --> 01:05:28.427
I am the owner of
Wuthering Heights now.


613
01:05:39.438 --> 01:05:43.375
Well, hm, I'm eager to see
what you do with the place.


614
01:05:53.118 --> 01:05:57.289
Cathy, do you think I
could maybe speak to you?


615
01:05:59.191 --> 01:06:01.360
Isabella, can you leave us?

616
01:06:10.703 --> 01:06:13.539
We've both been
through so much.


617
01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:19.746
Please, please, we can
undo what was done.


618
01:06:19.779 --> 01:06:21.380
And now I have
come back for you.


619
01:06:28.353 --> 01:06:29.187
Mm.

620
01:06:31.456 --> 01:06:34.226
Where do you expect to
take us, Heathcliff?


621
01:06:36.629 --> 01:06:39.732
Away from here.
Away from all this.


622
01:06:39.766 --> 01:06:43.368
I've seen the world now,
Cathy, and it is beautiful.


623
01:06:44.904 --> 01:06:45.772
Come with me.

624
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:51.811
Heathcliff, I can't.

625
01:06:54.279 --> 01:06:57.282
I'm having, I'm
having Edgar's child.


626
01:07:05.457 --> 01:07:07.326
How can you do
this to me, Cathy?


627
01:07:08.293 --> 01:07:11.731
How can I do it? You're
a fine one to talk.


628
01:07:11.764 --> 01:07:13.165
You weren't there.

629
01:07:13.198 --> 01:07:14.834
You don't know. Don't
talk to me anymore.


630
01:07:16.268 --> 01:07:19.137
Cathy, please. Please.

631
01:07:22.274 --> 01:07:23.643
Heathcliff.

632
01:07:23.676 --> 01:07:26.278
You aren't a very nice person

633
01:07:26.311 --> 01:07:28.347
to come here and
communicate this way.


634
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.617
Get your hands out
of your pockets.


635
01:07:33.953 --> 01:07:35.220
Okay, then,

636
01:07:36.321 --> 01:07:37.790
it's all right, it's all right.

637
01:07:37.824 --> 01:07:42.527
There's still time.
It doesn't matter.


638
01:07:42.561 --> 01:07:43.863
We can all leave.

639
01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:48.233
Me, you and the child,
we can all leave.


640
01:07:48.266 --> 01:07:50.502
Please, Cathy.

641
01:07:50.535 --> 01:07:53.773
Cathy, Cathy.

642
01:07:53.806 --> 01:07:56.576
No, no, you are too late.

643
01:07:56.609 --> 01:07:57.610
You are my life.

644
01:07:59.478 --> 01:08:00.312
You are my life.

645
01:08:02.314 --> 01:08:03.415
Heathcliff.

646
01:08:08.387 --> 01:08:10.288
Stay with me, please.

647
01:08:12.457 --> 01:08:14.459
I can't, I can't, okay.

648
01:09:30.737 --> 01:09:32.004
Mr. Heathcliff.

649
01:09:32.038 --> 01:09:33.873
Cathy was cruel
to you yesterday.


650
01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.376
As her friend, I feel the need
to apologize for her conduct.


651
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:42.849
You needn't apologize. I'm
well aware of Cathy's nature.


652
01:09:44.449 --> 01:09:46.686
Oh, stop sighing, Isabella.

653
01:09:47.787 --> 01:09:49.589
You are harsh and cruel to me.

654
01:09:50.355 --> 01:09:52.959
It's jealousy that
makes her strike out.


655
01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:55.595
Jealousy?

656
01:09:55.628 --> 01:09:59.331
Oh yes, she is quite jealous.

657
01:09:59.364 --> 01:10:00.666
You told me to
ramble where I pleased


658
01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.002
while you sauntered on
with Mr. Heathcliff.


659
01:10:03.035 --> 01:10:06.505
You wished me away because you
knew I wanted to be with him.


660
01:10:08.574 --> 01:10:11.577
You desire no one to
be loved but yourself.


661
01:10:11.611 --> 01:10:14.647
Cathy can only put on a silk
costume and play the part,


662
01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.783
but you, Miss Linton,

663
01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:21.486
are truly a lady.

664
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.489
Heathcliff is an
untamed creature,


665
01:10:24.523 --> 01:10:26.458
and it is your powerful
ignorance of his character,


666
01:10:26.491 --> 01:10:30.963
Isabella, and nothing else,
that makes you love him.


667
01:10:30.997 --> 01:10:32.598
A beautiful lady.

668
01:10:35.902 --> 01:10:37.536
Oh, Heathcliff.

669
01:10:39.138 --> 01:10:41.641
We've been quarreling
like cats about you.


670
01:10:41.674 --> 01:10:42.942
Catherine, no.

671
01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:48.513
Mind us, this love I have

672
01:10:48.547 --> 01:10:51.617
is nothing like the love
she entertains for you.


673
01:10:51.651 --> 01:10:54.654
Oh no you don't.

674
01:10:54.687 --> 01:10:56.122
Oh go on then.

675
01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.561
Sweet Judas.

676
01:11:04.831 --> 01:11:05.998
Who is it, Nelly?

677
01:11:15.007 --> 01:11:17.409
You weren't telling
the truth, were you?


678
01:11:17.442 --> 01:11:18.443
Oh please.

679
01:11:19.511 --> 01:11:22.547
I like her too well to let
you seek to win her over.


680
01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:25.751
And I like her too
little to attempt it.


681
01:11:25.785 --> 01:11:30.790
Then again, she is her
brother's heir, is she not?


682
01:11:51.811 --> 01:11:52.645
Now.

683
01:11:54.747 --> 01:11:55.681
Not much longer.

684
01:12:07.525 --> 01:12:08.895
Wait, no, I...

685
01:12:08.928 --> 01:12:09.996
Heathcliff.

686
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:20.907
I told you to
leave Isabella alone.


687
01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:21.908
What's it to you?

688
01:12:23.508 --> 01:12:24.944
I have every right to
kiss her, if she chooses,


689
01:12:24.977 --> 01:12:26.646
and you have no right to object.

690
01:12:27.512 --> 01:12:28.681
I am not your husband.

691
01:12:32.184 --> 01:12:34.787
If you love Isabella,
then you shall marry her.


692
01:12:36.088 --> 01:12:37.823
But tell me the
truth, Heathcliff,


693
01:12:39.825 --> 01:12:41.160
do you love her?

694
01:12:42.795 --> 01:12:45.097
Thank you for telling me
your sister's little secret.


695
01:12:46.732 --> 01:12:48.500
This way, I'll make
the most of it.


696
01:12:52.638 --> 01:12:54.807
Have you been listening
at the door, Edgar?


697
01:12:58.644 --> 01:12:59.812
I was not ignorant
to your miserable,


698
01:12:59.845 --> 01:13:02.081
degraded character,
Mr. Heathcliff,


699
01:13:02.114 --> 01:13:04.116
but foolishly I acquiesced
to my wife's desire


700
01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:05.718
to keep your acquaintance.

701
01:13:06.752 --> 01:13:09.487
Hereafter, you are no longer
welcome in this household.


702
01:13:10.589 --> 01:13:12.224
I require your
immediate departure.


703
01:13:13.192 --> 01:13:14.961
Nelly, fetch the men.

704
01:13:19.131 --> 01:13:22.034
Cathy, this lamb of yours
threatens like a bull.


705
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:25.671
By God, Linton, I
am mortally sorry


706
01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:28.007
you are not worth the
trouble of knocking down.


707
01:13:29.742 --> 01:13:31.277
Heathcliff.

708
01:13:46.759 --> 01:13:50.495
I wish you the joy of
this perfect coward, Cathy.


709
01:13:52.164 --> 01:13:53.766
And I compliment you.

710
01:14:11.617 --> 01:14:14.720
Catherine, remain
where you are.


711
01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:18.758
After today's events, do
you intend on continuing


712
01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:20.726
your intimacies
with Mr. Heathcliff?


713
01:14:22.795 --> 01:14:24.764
Leave me alone.

714
01:14:24.797 --> 01:14:27.199
Your cold blood cannot
be worked into a fever.


715
01:14:28.634 --> 01:14:30.836
Your veins are
full of ice water.


716
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:33.839
Will you be with Heathcliff,
or will you be with me?


717
01:14:35.641 --> 01:14:38.778
You cannot be his
friend and my wife.


718
01:14:38.811 --> 01:14:40.846
I require you to choose.

719
01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.914
Oh!

720
01:14:42.547 --> 01:14:45.818
I require to be left alone, oh!

721
01:14:48.187 --> 01:14:49.655
Catherine.

722
01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:01.734
I'm going to die,
aren't I, Nelly?


723
01:15:03.836 --> 01:15:04.804
You're not gonna die.

724
01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:10.709
Heathcliff then,
he doesn't love me.


725
01:15:11.644 --> 01:15:12.645
He never missed me.

726
01:15:15.648 --> 01:15:16.916
I'm afraid of being alone.

727
01:15:18.751 --> 01:15:19.718
You're not alone.

728
01:15:21.887 --> 01:15:24.290
Oh, I need him not to wait

729
01:15:24.323 --> 01:15:26.325
and to come straight
down off the moor.


730
01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.296
Oh, let me have just one breath.

731
01:15:30.329 --> 01:15:31.163
I will not.

732
01:15:32.031 --> 01:15:32.865
No.

733
01:15:40.739 --> 01:15:42.374
Why am I so changed?

734
01:15:44.743 --> 01:15:47.113
In an instant, I was
converted into Miss Linton,


735
01:15:48.681 --> 01:15:50.716
the lady of Thrushcross Grange.

736
01:15:52.118 --> 01:15:52.952
I am

737
01:15:55.888 --> 01:15:59.593
an exile, an outcast
from my world.


738
01:16:06.732 --> 01:16:08.400
I wish I were our dogs.

739
01:16:13.072 --> 01:16:15.341
I wish I were a girl again.

740
01:16:16.842 --> 01:16:18.210
Savage and hardy.

741
01:16:20.146 --> 01:16:21.380
Laughing at miseries.

742
01:16:24.016 --> 01:16:26.185
Not maddening under them.

743
01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.357
I should be myself if I
were among the heather.


744
01:16:32.391 --> 01:16:34.927
Nelly, let me feel the wind!

745
01:16:35.961 --> 01:16:38.330
No, ma'am, I will not let
you catch your death of cold.


746
01:16:38.364 --> 01:16:39.832
No!

747
01:16:47.773 --> 01:16:49.675
Look, there's my room,

748
01:16:51.177 --> 01:16:52.778
with a candle in the window.

749
01:16:54.046 --> 01:16:56.682
Heathcliff is waiting for me.

750
01:16:59.418 --> 01:17:00.352
Heathcliff.

751
01:17:02.121 --> 01:17:03.389
I dare you now.

752
01:17:04.823 --> 01:17:06.792
Will you venture?

753
01:17:06.825 --> 01:17:09.461
I shall not rest
until you are with me.


754
01:17:11.797 --> 01:17:12.865
I never will.

755
01:17:16.969 --> 01:17:17.970
He's considering.

756
01:17:20.873 --> 01:17:23.475
He'd rather
I come to him.


757
01:17:23.509 --> 01:17:26.111
Nelly, are you
mad? Shut the window.


758
01:17:28.948 --> 01:17:29.949
Catherine.

759
01:17:31.984 --> 01:17:35.955
Edgar, you are one of
those that is ever found


760
01:17:35.988 --> 01:17:37.890
when you're least
wanted.


761
01:17:42.461 --> 01:17:44.296
Am I nothing to you anymore?

762
01:17:45.464 --> 01:17:47.933
Do you love that
wretch Heathcliff?


763
01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:55.207
What you touch at
present, you may have,


764
01:17:55.241 --> 01:17:57.243
but my soul will be that hilltop

765
01:17:57.276 --> 01:17:59.511
before you lay your
hands on me again.


766
01:18:02.514 --> 01:18:04.450
What you had of me is gone.

767
01:18:07.219 --> 01:18:08.921
Her mind wanders, sir.

768
01:18:08.954 --> 01:18:11.523
She's been talking
nonsense all night.


769
01:18:11.557 --> 01:18:12.925
Send for Dr. Kenneth.

770
01:18:14.026 --> 01:18:17.029
We must take precautions so
she doesn't harm herself.


771
01:18:19.498 --> 01:18:20.332
Or the baby.

772
01:18:36.915 --> 01:18:37.549
Isabella?

773
01:19:07.012 --> 01:19:07.846
Sir?

774
01:19:12.084 --> 01:19:14.019
It's from Miss Isabella.

775
01:19:45.317 --> 01:19:46.151
Oh.

776
01:19:48.153 --> 01:19:50.089
So what shall we do?

777
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:58.497
She left of her own accord.

778
01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:02.301
Who the hell are you?

779
01:20:02.334 --> 01:20:06.438
I was Isabella Linton.
We've met before, sir.


780
01:20:06.472 --> 01:20:09.141
I've just married Heathcliff,
and he brought me here.


781
01:20:14.647 --> 01:20:17.116
Heathcliff married you?

782
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:19.184
From now on, she is
my sister only by name.


783
01:20:23.255 --> 01:20:24.523
Not because I disown her.

784
01:20:27.493 --> 01:20:28.961
She has disowned me.

785
01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.197
Where shall I sleep?

786
01:20:32.931 --> 01:20:35.467
Heathcliff's bedroom
is up the stairs,


787
01:20:35.501 --> 01:20:37.002
second door on the right.

788
01:20:38.738 --> 01:20:43.909
Make sure to bolt the
door, Mrs. Heathcliff.


789
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:45.043
Why?

790
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:52.251
It's a great tempter to
a desperate man, is it not?


791
01:20:54.219 --> 01:20:57.156
Every night, I try
to open his door.


792
01:20:57.189 --> 01:21:01.560
If once I find it
unlocked, he's done for.


793
01:21:03.696 --> 01:21:06.165
When the time comes,

794
01:21:06.198 --> 01:21:08.701
all the angels in heaven
will not save him.


795
01:21:10.436 --> 01:21:11.738
I'll warn him.

796
01:21:11.771 --> 01:21:15.073
I don't give a damn if you do.

797
01:21:16.108 --> 01:21:21.246
Wuthering Heights will be
mine, his gold will be mine,


798
01:21:22.181 --> 01:21:23.048
and then his blood.

799
01:21:28.086 --> 01:21:29.955
Hell can have your soul.

800
01:22:34.286 --> 01:22:36.756
Nelly, how are
you this afternoon?


801
01:22:36.789 --> 01:22:38.658
I've come to
see Miss Isabella.


802
01:22:38.691 --> 01:22:40.425
Have you a letter for me?

803
01:22:40.459 --> 01:22:42.327
I have nothing.

804
01:22:42.361 --> 01:22:45.364
My master sends his love,
but he refuses to communicate


805
01:22:45.397 --> 01:22:46.766
with this household ever again.

806
01:22:48.233 --> 01:22:49.067
Sorry.

807
01:22:51.103 --> 01:22:52.739
And how is Cathy?

808
01:22:52.772 --> 01:22:56.375
Mrs. Linton gave birth to
a little girl last night.


809
01:22:56.408 --> 01:22:58.477
She'll never be like she was.

810
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:59.812
Her life was spared.

811
01:22:59.846 --> 01:23:01.246
What will he call her?

812
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.247
Catherine.

813
01:23:03.315 --> 01:23:04.651
This young lady
looks sadly worse


814
01:23:04.684 --> 01:23:06.619
for her change of condition.

815
01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:10.155
Someone's love falls far
short in her case, obviously.


816
01:23:11.356 --> 01:23:12.457
I should guess her own.

817
01:23:16.161 --> 01:23:19.364
Under delusion, she pictured
me a hero of romance


818
01:23:19.398 --> 01:23:21.333
and expected
unlimited indulgences


819
01:23:21.366 --> 01:23:23.770
from my chivalrous devotion.

820
01:23:23.803 --> 01:23:26.138
It was a marvelous
effort on her part


821
01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:29.207
to discover that I
did not love her.


822
01:23:29.241 --> 01:23:30.342
I've never in all my life met

823
01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:32.277
with such an abject
thing as she.


824
01:23:33.646 --> 01:23:35.547
She even disgraces
the name of Linton.


825
01:23:37.382 --> 01:23:38.483
Take care, Nelly.

826
01:23:39.418 --> 01:23:43.088
He means to provoke
Edgar past desperation.


827
01:23:44.356 --> 01:23:45.190
I'll die first.

828
01:23:47.392 --> 01:23:49.194
To your pleasure, 
I can imagine.

829
01:23:50.863 --> 01:23:52.164
Or to see him dead.

830
01:23:53.465 --> 01:23:55.467
Enough with the
providence. Out of my sight!


831
01:23:56.301 --> 01:23:59.371
Nelly, I must see her.

832
01:24:01.206 --> 01:24:02.274
I cannot allow that.

833
01:24:02.307 --> 01:24:03.508
Cathy's delirious.

834
01:24:03.542 --> 01:24:04.911
She slips in and
out of consciousness


835
01:24:04.944 --> 01:24:06.211
and remembers very little.

836
01:24:06.244 --> 01:24:07.479
She must call for me.

837
01:24:08.648 --> 01:24:10.315
You know she has
not forgotten me.


838
01:24:10.349 --> 01:24:12.417
For every thought
she spends on Linton,


839
01:24:12.451 --> 01:24:14.386
she spends a thousand on me.

840
01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:17.489
Nelly, am I to fight my way

841
01:24:17.522 --> 01:24:19.424
through Edgar and
all his footmen?


842
01:24:21.326 --> 01:24:22.494
Will you please be the friend

843
01:24:22.527 --> 01:24:25.163
you always have
and let me see her?


844
01:24:26.799 --> 01:24:27.634
Please.

845
01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.354
Cathy.

846
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.234
How can I bear it?

847
01:25:04.904 --> 01:25:08.708
You've broken my heart,
and now you come to me


848
01:25:08.741 --> 01:25:11.678
as if you are the
one to be pitied.


849
01:25:12.679 --> 01:25:15.380
I shall not pity you.

850
01:25:15.414 --> 01:25:16.582
You killed me.

851
01:25:19.886 --> 01:25:22.287
You tell me, how
many years do you


852
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.423
plan on living after I'm gone?

853
01:25:26.558 --> 01:25:28.460
While you're
possessed of the devil


854
01:25:28.493 --> 01:25:30.830
and speak to me in the
manner while you are dying,


855
01:25:30.863 --> 01:25:32.999
you know those words
will be bred in my memory


856
01:25:33.032 --> 01:25:34.867
while you are at peace.

857
01:25:34.901 --> 01:25:36.636
I shall not be at peace!

858
01:25:41.506 --> 01:25:43.843
I don't wish to torment you.

859
01:25:48.413 --> 01:25:50.315
Come to me, Heathcliff.

860
01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:12.304
Why did you betray
your own heart, Cathy?


861
01:26:14.073 --> 01:26:15.507
You've killed yourself.

862
01:26:21.013 --> 01:26:21.914
You.

863
01:26:24.549 --> 01:26:25.618
You loved me.

864
01:26:28.621 --> 01:26:31.624
Then what right had
you to leave me?


865
01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.597
For the poor fancy
you felt for Linton?


866
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:40.733
This degradation and
misery and death,


867
01:26:40.767 --> 01:26:44.436
nothing God or Satan could
inflict could part us.


868
01:26:44.469 --> 01:26:45.504
You...

869
01:26:47.573 --> 01:26:48.941
You of your own will did.

870
01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:54.546
I have not broken
your heart, Cathy.


871
01:26:55.948 --> 01:26:58.818
You have broken it.

872
01:26:58.851 --> 01:27:02.354
And in breaking it
you have broken mine.


873
01:27:02.387 --> 01:27:04.489
If I've done wrong,
I'm dying for it.


874
01:27:06.424 --> 01:27:07.559
You left me too.

875
01:27:08.928 --> 01:27:10.295
I forgive you.

876
01:27:11.998 --> 01:27:12.899
Forgive me.

877
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:17.637
I love my murderer.
But yours, how can I?


878
01:27:37.657 --> 01:27:39.692
I wish I'd told you.

879
01:27:42.427 --> 01:27:43.495
But I cannot.

880
01:27:46.431 --> 01:27:49.534
My master has
returned. You must leave.


881
01:27:59.011 --> 01:28:00.545
Cathy, I must go.

882
01:28:03.683 --> 01:28:05.718
No, no, you mustn't.

883
01:28:06.586 --> 01:28:07.620
I must.

884
01:28:08.788 --> 01:28:10.890
No, not for a minute.

885
01:28:14.492 --> 01:28:15.895
I must.

886
01:28:15.928 --> 01:28:17.997
No, no, don't leave me.

887
01:28:19.031 --> 01:28:20.633
No, don't leave me.

888
01:28:21.934 --> 01:28:24.604
Heathcliff, if
you stay it will be


889
01:28:24.637 --> 01:28:26.706
your most diabolical deed.

890
01:28:33.545 --> 01:28:34.981
What in God's name?

891
01:28:50.997 --> 01:28:54.499
Unless you be a fiend,
you'll help her first.


892
01:28:54.532 --> 01:28:56.568
Then you shall speak with me.

893
01:29:05.645 --> 01:29:06.444
No!

894
01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:11.483
No!

895
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:13.653
No!

896
01:29:13.686 --> 01:29:14.620
Heathcliff!

897
01:29:15.788 --> 01:29:16.722
Heathcliff!

898
01:29:16.756 --> 01:29:18.925
What have you done to her?

899
01:29:18.958 --> 01:29:19.792
Catherine!

900
01:29:20.693 --> 01:29:22.828
What have you done to her?

901
01:29:45.284 --> 01:29:48.688
She's dead. I've not
waited for you to learn that.


902
01:29:50.690 --> 01:29:53.558
Don't you snivel
before me, damn you.


903
01:29:53.592 --> 01:29:55.161
She wants none of your tears.

904
01:29:55.995 --> 01:29:57.096
She is at peace now.

905
01:30:00.166 --> 01:30:02.034
Did she die like a saint?

906
01:30:02.068 --> 01:30:05.071
You poor wretch, your
pride can't blind God.


907
01:30:09.842 --> 01:30:10.743
How did she die?

908
01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:17.583
Her senses never
returned after you left.


909
01:30:17.616 --> 01:30:19.517
She sank into a sleep.

910
01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:21.519
Her life closed
in a gentle dream.


911
01:30:22.855 --> 01:30:25.557
May she wake as kindly
in the next world.


912
01:30:25.591 --> 01:30:26.826
May she wake in torment.

913
01:30:30.162 --> 01:30:32.932
I pray one prayer,
and I'll repeat it


914
01:30:32.965 --> 01:30:34.499
until my tongue stiffens.

915
01:30:36.235 --> 01:30:41.240
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not
rest as long as I am living.


916
01:30:43.309 --> 01:30:45.077
You say I killed
you. Haunt me then!


917
01:30:48.314 --> 01:30:52.184
Be with me always! Take
any form, drive me mad!


918
01:30:55.121 --> 01:30:56.856
As long as you don't leave me

919
01:30:56.889 --> 01:31:00.793
in this abyss where
I cannot find you.


920
01:31:00.826 --> 01:31:04.296
I cannot live without my life.

921
01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:09.534
I cannot live without my soul!

922
01:31:11.137 --> 01:31:13.706
I cannot live without my life.

923
01:31:13.739 --> 01:31:18.044
I cannot live without
my soul.


924
01:31:29.955 --> 01:31:32.625
I cannot live without my life.

925
01:31:44.703 --> 01:31:45.337
Cathy!

926
01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:50.342
No!

927
01:32:00.419 --> 01:32:01.253
No!

928
01:32:27.346 --> 01:32:28.948
Do you believe such people

929
01:32:28.981 --> 01:32:32.118
are happy in the other
world, Miss Dean?


930
01:32:34.987 --> 01:32:36.922
Retracing the course
of Catherine Linton,


931
01:32:38.057 --> 01:32:40.826
I fear we have no right
to believe she is.


932
01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.962
But we'll leave that
to her and her maker.


933
01:32:47.399 --> 01:32:49.168
To the surprise of
the whole parish,


934
01:32:49.201 --> 01:32:51.904
Catherine's burial was neither
under the carved monuments


935
01:32:51.937 --> 01:32:55.007
of the Lintons nor by the
tombs of her relations outside.


936
01:32:56.108 --> 01:32:59.912
It was down on a green slope,
in a corner of the churchyard,


937
01:33:00.846 --> 01:33:03.182
where the walls are so
low that the heather


938
01:33:03.215 --> 01:33:06.719
climbs over from the
moors and buries it.


939
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.196
You and I have a great
debt to settle with him.


940
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:19.165
If neither of us were
cowards, we could combine.


941
01:33:19.198 --> 01:33:20.399
He's leaving me...

942
01:33:20.432 --> 01:33:22.134
Are you as soft
as your brother?


943
01:33:22.168 --> 01:33:23.435
Are you willing to
endure to the last


944
01:33:23.469 --> 01:33:24.937
and not attempt repayment?

945
01:33:24.970 --> 01:33:26.438
I'm weary of enduring.

946
01:33:26.472 --> 01:33:28.941
He will be my ruin, and
you and your child's death,


947
01:33:28.974 --> 01:33:31.110
not unless we get him first!

948
01:33:31.143 --> 01:33:32.178
No, you mustn't hurt him.

949
01:33:38.918 --> 01:33:40.853
No, Heathcliff, stop!

950
01:33:40.886 --> 01:33:43.489
No, get off him. You
might kill him, stop it!


951
01:33:43.522 --> 01:33:45.858
I couldn't kill him

952
01:33:45.891 --> 01:33:47.259
Heathcliff, stop!

953
01:33:47.293 --> 01:33:48.961
Let him go. Stop it!

954
01:33:56.802 --> 01:33:59.338
I believe our
father gave me this.


955
01:34:05.477 --> 01:34:09.882
If God gave me the
strength to strangle you,


956
01:34:09.915 --> 01:34:11.884
I'd go to hell with joy.

957
01:34:14.853 --> 01:34:18.123
Isn't it enough you've
already murdered his sister?


958
01:34:18.157 --> 01:34:21.093
Everybody knows she'd still be
living if it weren't for you.


959
01:34:22.795 --> 01:34:24.964
So why don't you go
lay over her grave


960
01:34:24.997 --> 01:34:27.233
like an old, faithful dog?

961
01:34:27.266 --> 01:34:30.436
Surely the world isn't
worth living in now, is it?


962
01:34:54.126 --> 01:34:55.995
Heathcliff.

963
01:35:13.512 --> 01:35:14.947
Here you are.

964
01:35:19.118 --> 01:35:20.352
Drink up.

965
01:35:34.133 --> 01:35:37.069
Your brother
barely knew her too.


966
01:35:39.905 --> 01:35:41.106
You clean him up.

967
01:35:59.058 --> 01:36:00.959
Isabella, what
has happened to you?


968
01:36:00.993 --> 01:36:02.961
Hindley is dead.

969
01:36:02.995 --> 01:36:05.931
He fought Heathcliff true
to form, drunk as a lord,


970
01:36:05.964 --> 01:36:08.133
and Heathcliff fought back.

971
01:36:08.167 --> 01:36:10.169
I cannot live another
day with that villain.


972
01:36:11.136 --> 01:36:13.372
I'm leaving for London,
and I've just come by


973
01:36:13.405 --> 01:36:15.407
to see you and the
baby before I depart.


974
01:36:30.356 --> 01:36:32.191
If my brother asks,

975
01:36:32.224 --> 01:36:34.893
I permit you to tell
him where I've gone.


976
01:36:34.927 --> 01:36:37.996
But do not tell Mr.
Heathcliff, will you promise?


977
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.897
I promise.

978
01:36:41.066 --> 01:36:43.135
Give my love to my brother.

979
01:36:43.168 --> 01:36:44.069
I'll write to you.

980
01:36:47.039 --> 01:36:47.973
Godspeed.

981
01:37:01.621 --> 01:37:04.490
Now, my bonny lad,
let's see if one tree


982
01:37:04.523 --> 01:37:06.425
won't grow as crooked as another

983
01:37:07.092 --> 01:37:09.128
with the same wind to twist it.

984
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:34.219
Hareton, who should
now be the first gentleman


985
01:37:34.253 --> 01:37:37.022
in the neighborhood,
was reduced to a state


986
01:37:37.055 --> 01:37:40.159
of complete dependence on
his father's inveterate enemy


987
01:37:40.959 --> 01:37:42.995
and lives in his own
house as a servant.


988
01:38:12.257 --> 01:38:16.128
The next 15 years, following
that dismal period,


989
01:38:16.161 --> 01:38:18.130
were the happiest of my life.

990
01:38:19.465 --> 01:38:22.000
Little Catherine
grew like a larch.


991
01:38:22.034 --> 01:38:25.070
She was light and
fair like the Lintons,


992
01:38:25.103 --> 01:38:27.172
but with the handsome
eyes of her mother.


993
01:38:29.174 --> 01:38:29.975
Good morning, Papa.

994
01:38:30.008 --> 01:38:32.377
Good morning,
Catherine, Nelly.


995
01:38:32.411 --> 01:38:34.146
Morning, sir.

996
01:38:38.818 --> 01:38:42.254
She had not been
beyond the grange by herself.


997
01:38:42.287 --> 01:38:47.292
Wuthering Heights, and
Heathcliff, did not exist for her.


998
01:38:52.564 --> 01:38:53.766
Oh.

999
01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.802
Something wrong,
Miss Catherine?


1000
01:38:55.835 --> 01:38:59.304
Oh, no, I've just
a slight headache.


1001
01:38:59.338 --> 01:39:01.240
Would you like some tea?

1002
01:39:01.273 --> 01:39:03.342
Oh no, no. I'll just rest.

1003
01:39:36.609 --> 01:39:37.610
Catherine?

1004
01:39:40.479 --> 01:39:41.313
Catherine?

1005
01:39:45.417 --> 01:39:46.251
Sir?

1006
01:39:49.221 --> 01:39:50.055
Sir.

1007
01:39:55.193 --> 01:39:57.296
I'm afraid I'm quite lost.

1008
01:39:57.329 --> 01:39:59.766
Do you know where Thrushcross
Grange is from here?


1009
01:39:59.799 --> 01:40:02.702
You're Edgar Linton's
daughter, aren't you?


1010
01:40:04.369 --> 01:40:06.538
Yes, I am. Do
you know my father?


1011
01:40:07.807 --> 01:40:09.408
So to speak.

1012
01:40:09.441 --> 01:40:11.543
My name is Catherine.
What's yours?


1013
01:40:12.745 --> 01:40:13.580
Hareton.

1014
01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.282
I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance.


1015
01:40:18.718 --> 01:40:22.421
I'm afraid it's going to rain.
Do you live far from here?


1016
01:40:38.938 --> 01:40:40.172
Miss Catherine?

1017
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:46.613
If your father had any notion
of you being at this house,


1018
01:40:46.646 --> 01:40:49.214
you'd be glad enough to get out.

1019
01:40:49.247 --> 01:40:51.918
It's your father's,
isn't it, Hareton?


1020
01:40:51.951 --> 01:40:52.785
No.

1021
01:40:55.354 --> 01:40:57.289
I thought you had
been the owner's son.


1022
01:40:57.322 --> 01:40:59.358
Are you a servant?

1023
01:40:59.391 --> 01:41:02.327
I'll see you damned
before I'd be your servant.


1024
01:41:02.361 --> 01:41:03.830
You'll see me what?

1025
01:41:03.863 --> 01:41:04.697
Damned.

1026
01:41:06.365 --> 01:41:08.367
How dare you speak
to me that way?


1027
01:41:09.568 --> 01:41:11.536
I'll tell my father
what you said.


1028
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:14.539
Miss Catherine here knows
nothing about being civil.


1029
01:41:14.574 --> 01:41:18.477
Although Hareton's not your
master's son, he's your cousin.


1030
01:41:19.511 --> 01:41:20.747
My cousin?

1031
01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:21.814
Mm-hm.

1032
01:41:21.848 --> 01:41:24.717
Nelly, you must be mistaken.

1033
01:41:24.751 --> 01:41:27.854
My father has just gone to
fetch my cousin from London.


1034
01:41:27.887 --> 01:41:29.722
A gentleman's son.

1035
01:41:31.223 --> 01:41:32.424
People can have many
cousins of all sorts


1036
01:41:32.457 --> 01:41:34.226
without being the worse for it.

1037
01:41:35.828 --> 01:41:36.929
Miss Catherine.

1038
01:41:47.506 --> 01:41:50.275
Promise me you'll
look after him, Nelly.


1039
01:41:50.308 --> 01:41:52.578
You'll love him like your own.

1040
01:41:54.947 --> 01:41:55.782
Hareton.

1041
01:41:58.383 --> 01:41:59.619
We'll not
tell your father


1042
01:41:59.652 --> 01:42:01.286
that you went to
Wuthering Heights.


1043
01:42:02.454 --> 01:42:04.523
I cannot
understand why not.


1044
01:42:04.556 --> 01:42:05.457
Before your father departed,

1045
01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:07.593
did he or did he not
tell you to mind me?


1046
01:42:09.762 --> 01:42:13.331
Well, since you've deceived me
in your counterfeit sickness


1047
01:42:13.365 --> 01:42:16.903
to break your father's one
rule, perhaps you could repay me


1048
01:42:16.936 --> 01:42:19.371
by not telling him I
failed as your guardian.


1049
01:42:21.473 --> 01:42:22.775
I shan't whisper a word.

1050
01:42:26.713 --> 01:42:28.346
A letter
announced the day


1051
01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.483
of my master Edgar
Linton's return.


1052
01:42:31.516 --> 01:42:32.317
Catherine.

1053
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.985
Papa.

1054
01:42:34.721 --> 01:42:36.989
Now, Catherine, your
cousin Linton is not


1055
01:42:37.023 --> 01:42:39.291
as strong or as
merry as you are.


1056
01:42:40.459 --> 01:42:41.694
He's just recently
lost his mother.


1057
01:42:41.728 --> 01:42:43.663
Isabella was dead.

1058
01:42:43.696 --> 01:42:46.666
Just don't expect him to
play and run about just yet.


1059
01:42:46.699 --> 01:42:48.567
And he
wrote to bid me get


1060
01:42:48.601 --> 01:42:50.302
mourning for his daughter.

1061
01:42:50.335 --> 01:42:50.970
Linton.

1062
01:42:53.573 --> 01:42:54.841
This is your cousin Catherine.

1063
01:42:55.875 --> 01:42:57.610
She's very fond of you already.

1064
01:42:58.644 --> 01:43:01.413
And arrange a room
and other accommodations


1065
01:43:01.446 --> 01:43:02.949
for his youthful nephew.

1066
01:43:04.483 --> 01:43:05.651
May I go to bed, Uncle.

1067
01:43:06.986 --> 01:43:09.287
A pale,
delicate, effeminate boy.


1068
01:43:10.522 --> 01:43:11.556
Nelly.

1069
01:43:25.570 --> 01:43:27.472
Good evening, Heathcliff.

1070
01:43:27.506 --> 01:43:29.876
What business brings
you here tonight?


1071
01:43:29.909 --> 01:43:31.577
I am here to see my son.

1072
01:43:32.745 --> 01:43:34.046
Master Linton has gone to bed

1073
01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.381
along with the rest
of the household.


1074
01:43:36.414 --> 01:43:38.450
And unless you have
something particular to say,


1075
01:43:38.483 --> 01:43:40.052
you may entrust
your message to me.


1076
01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.888
Who is it, Nelly?

1077
01:43:44.757 --> 01:43:46.659
I
have come for my son.


1078
01:43:47.827 --> 01:43:49.896
He may be your son,

1079
01:43:49.929 --> 01:43:52.799
but his mother desires
him to remain in my care.


1080
01:43:52.832 --> 01:43:55.400
His mother is dead.

1081
01:43:56.535 --> 01:43:57.970
How did you come to know that?

1082
01:43:58.004 --> 01:43:59.839
How I know is of no matter.

1083
01:44:01.473 --> 01:44:03.910
Surely as a magistrate
you will not keep a father


1084
01:44:03.943 --> 01:44:05.845
from caring for his only child.

1085
01:44:09.115 --> 01:44:10.883
Nelly will accompany Linton

1086
01:44:10.917 --> 01:44:13.518
to Wuthering Heights
in the morning.


1087
01:44:13.552 --> 01:44:14.754
He has just come
from a long journey,


1088
01:44:14.787 --> 01:44:16.756
and his health is
very precarious.


1089
01:44:18.157 --> 01:44:20.827
If you care for him at all,
which, with much regret


1090
01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:24.764
I doubt you do, you'll let
him sleep through the night.


1091
01:44:26.565 --> 01:44:27.700
Very well.

1092
01:44:30.970 --> 01:44:33.706
I look forward to seeing
you in the morning, Nelly.


1093
01:44:36.175 --> 01:44:37.009
Good evening.

1094
01:44:48.721 --> 01:44:49.755
Mr. Linton
commissioned me


1095
01:44:49.789 --> 01:44:51.423
to take the boy home early.

1096
01:44:52.457 --> 01:44:54.760
He was very reluctant
to be roused


1097
01:44:54.794 --> 01:44:58.563
from his bed at five o'clock,
and astonished to be informed


1098
01:44:58.598 --> 01:45:00.733
that he must prepare
for further traveling.


1099
01:45:02.201 --> 01:45:04.971
But I softened up the matter
by stating that he was going


1100
01:45:05.004 --> 01:45:09.609
to spend some time with
his father, Mr. Heathcliff,


1101
01:45:09.642 --> 01:45:12.510
who wished to see him very much.

1102
01:45:17.449 --> 01:45:20.653
It is truly worse
than I expected.


1103
01:45:20.686 --> 01:45:21.787
You are your mother's son.

1104
01:45:28.961 --> 01:45:29.862
Do you know me?

1105
01:45:29.896 --> 01:45:30.730
No.

1106
01:45:32.665 --> 01:45:34.700
You've heard of
me, I dare say.


1107
01:45:34.734 --> 01:45:35.835
No.

1108
01:45:35.868 --> 01:45:39.739
Hm, your mother was wicked
to leave you in ignorance


1109
01:45:39.772 --> 01:45:41.707
of the sort of
father you possessed.


1110
01:45:41.741 --> 01:45:44.944
I hope you'll be kind
to your son, Heathcliff.


1111
01:45:44.977 --> 01:45:47.713
He's the only kin in the
world you'll ever know.


1112
01:45:47.747 --> 01:45:48.848
Remember that.

1113
01:45:48.881 --> 01:45:51.951
I will be very kind to
him, Nelly, you needn't fear.


1114
01:45:51.984 --> 01:45:53.886
After all, my son is
the prospective owner


1115
01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.154
of Thrushcross Grange.

1116
01:45:55.187 --> 01:45:57.156
I shall not wish him
to die until I was


1117
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:59.725
certain of being his successor.

1118
01:45:59.759 --> 01:46:02.695
That is the sole consideration
which I can endear, wealth.


1119
01:46:02.728 --> 01:46:04.697
Brought this for young Linton.

1120
01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:06.699
He won't need that.

1121
01:46:06.732 --> 01:46:09.769
Hm, the dainty chap
says he cannot eat it.


1122
01:46:09.802 --> 01:46:13.172
His mother was just the
same, just as hard to please.


1123
01:46:13.205 --> 01:46:15.808
Don't mention his
mother to me again,


1124
01:46:16.842 --> 01:46:18.744
and get him
something he can eat.


1125
01:46:21.546 --> 01:46:25.718
See, Nelly, all is fine.

1126
01:46:25.751 --> 01:46:26.652
Have a good afternoon.

1127
01:46:27.787 --> 01:46:30.656
On a beautiful
spring day, my young lady asked


1128
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:32.524
to have a ramble on
the moor with me.


1129
01:46:32.557 --> 01:46:35.493
She was off like
a young greyhound.


1130
01:46:35.527 --> 01:46:36.629
Young lady.

1131
01:46:36.662 --> 01:46:38.698
And as I
toiled to follow,


1132
01:46:38.731 --> 01:46:42.902
she came upon Mr. Heathcliff.

1133
01:46:42.935 --> 01:46:44.603
I hope it's still my father's.

1134
01:46:44.637 --> 01:46:46.639
And who is your father?

1135
01:46:46.672 --> 01:46:50.776
Edgar Linton, owner
of Thrushcross Grange.


1136
01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:52.211
Do you know him?

1137
01:46:56.182 --> 01:46:57.016
Very well.

1138
01:46:58.684 --> 01:46:59.719
Miss Catherine?

1139
01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.121
Miss Catherine.

1140
01:47:07.559 --> 01:47:08.627
Is he your son?

1141
01:47:10.696 --> 01:47:14.700
No, but I do have one.

1142
01:47:14.734 --> 01:47:15.835
And you've met him before.

1143
01:47:17.569 --> 01:47:18.871
My house is just over the hill.

1144
01:47:18.904 --> 01:47:20.806
Perhaps you would
like to come to tea.


1145
01:47:23.142 --> 01:47:25.845
Catherine, you are to
come with me at once.


1146
01:47:25.878 --> 01:47:27.313
I will not.

1147
01:47:27.346 --> 01:47:28.981
This man has just
invited me to tea


1148
01:47:29.015 --> 01:47:30.883
and said that I know his son.

1149
01:47:31.851 --> 01:47:34.720
I'm sure he's mistaken,
but what an adventure.


1150
01:47:36.756 --> 01:47:38.758
Heathcliff, my master
will hate me if he found out


1151
01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:40.593
I allowed her to
enter your house.


1152
01:47:40.626 --> 01:47:43.229
I will be blamed for your
devious design and discharged.


1153
01:47:45.231 --> 01:47:47.967
My design is as
honest as possible.


1154
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.270
I wish for the two cousins
to fall in love and marry.


1155
01:47:51.303 --> 01:47:54.707
And you needn't worry about
your job at the Grange.


1156
01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:57.209
There's always a position
for you at Wuthering Heights.


1157
01:48:03.182 --> 01:48:04.950
Oh, it's so lovely.

1158
01:48:08.287 --> 01:48:10.356
Now, do you know who that is?

1159
01:48:10.389 --> 01:48:11.223
Your son?

1160
01:48:12.825 --> 01:48:14.293
Linton, it's Linton!

1161
01:48:15.227 --> 01:48:17.863
Oh, you have very much changed.

1162
01:48:18.831 --> 01:48:20.900
And you must be my uncle then!

1163
01:48:22.835 --> 01:48:25.871
Why don't you come and visit
us at the Grange with Linton?


1164
01:48:25.905 --> 01:48:27.873
To think, all these years
such close neighbors


1165
01:48:27.907 --> 01:48:28.808
and to never visit us.

1166
01:48:32.011 --> 01:48:34.780
I visited once or twice
before you were born.


1167
01:48:36.882 --> 01:48:40.052
But your father and I quarreled
at one time in our lives.


1168
01:48:42.721 --> 01:48:43.889
Why did you quarrel?

1169
01:48:43.923 --> 01:48:47.760
He felt me too poor
to marry your sister,


1170
01:48:48.694 --> 01:48:52.698
and was grieved to learn
that I had won her.


1171
01:48:52.731 --> 01:48:56.202
His pride was hurt, and
he had never forgiven it.


1172
01:49:00.806 --> 01:49:04.810
Well Linton and I have
no share in your quarrel.


1173
01:49:04.844 --> 01:49:06.212
If Papa will not
let me come here,


1174
01:49:06.245 --> 01:49:08.948
then Linton must
come to the Grange.


1175
01:49:08.981 --> 01:49:10.850
To walk four
miles would kill me.


1176
01:49:10.883 --> 01:49:12.852
Please, come here,
Miss Catherine.


1177
01:49:12.885 --> 01:49:15.321
Not every morning but
once or twice a week.


1178
01:49:15.354 --> 01:49:17.990
Linton, have you nothing
to show your cousin?


1179
01:49:19.191 --> 01:49:20.860
Take her to the garden.

1180
01:49:20.893 --> 01:49:21.927
Oh, that sounds lovely.

1181
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:23.597
Wouldn't you rather sit here?

1182
01:49:24.997 --> 01:49:26.665
If
that's what you prefer.


1183
01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:28.701
I'll take you to the garden.

1184
01:49:34.373 --> 01:49:35.207
Very well.

1185
01:49:36.842 --> 01:49:38.811
Behave like a
gentleman, mind you.


1186
01:49:39.645 --> 01:49:41.847
And take your hands
out of your pockets.


1187
01:49:52.958 --> 01:49:55.027
Get up, you interloper.

1188
01:49:56.495 --> 01:49:59.098
Now you've got a rival for
your cousin's affections.


1189
01:50:02.434 --> 01:50:03.969
What does that name mean?

1190
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:06.172
Some damnable writing.

1191
01:50:07.973 --> 01:50:08.841
I can't read it.

1192
01:50:09.975 --> 01:50:11.043
I can read.

1193
01:50:12.111 --> 01:50:13.279
I want to know why it's there.

1194
01:50:13.312 --> 01:50:15.681
He does not know
his letters.


1195
01:50:16.849 --> 01:50:19.885
Could you believe in the existence
of such a colossal dunce?


1196
01:50:19.919 --> 01:50:21.954
Has anyone attempted
to teach him?


1197
01:50:25.424 --> 01:50:26.959
Or is he simple?

1198
01:50:26.992 --> 01:50:29.328
Please, there is nothing
the matter but laziness.


1199
01:50:29.361 --> 01:50:31.096
Is there, Earnshaw?

1200
01:50:31.130 --> 01:50:34.934
My cousin fancies you,
an idiot, Earnshaw.


1201
01:50:40.272 --> 01:50:42.875
If you weren't more
a lass than a lad,


1202
01:50:42.908 --> 01:50:44.376
I'd fell you this minute.

1203
01:50:46.178 --> 01:50:49.915
Nelly, you recollect
me at this age.


1204
01:50:49.949 --> 01:50:51.917
Did I ever look so stupid?

1205
01:50:51.951 --> 01:50:54.853
Worse, because you
were more sullen.


1206
01:50:57.823 --> 01:50:59.124
I would have
loved the lad had he been


1207
01:50:59.158 --> 01:51:02.828
someone else's, but I am sure
he is safe from her love.


1208
01:51:06.932 --> 01:51:09.835
Hindley would have been proud
of his son, wouldn't he?


1209
01:51:18.944 --> 01:51:21.413
Almost as proud as I am of mine.

1210
01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:38.030
Oh, Papa, I saw
Linton the other day,


1211
01:51:38.063 --> 01:51:39.498
at Wuthering Heights.

1212
01:51:40.399 --> 01:51:42.067
I met my uncle, too.

1213
01:51:43.435 --> 01:51:45.938
Why didn't you tell me
that Linton was nearby?


1214
01:51:50.843 --> 01:51:53.078
Catherine, you know why I kept

1215
01:51:53.112 --> 01:51:55.180
Linton's residence from you.

1216
01:51:57.082 --> 01:51:59.985
Is it because you
dislike Mr. Heathcliff?


1217
01:52:00.919 --> 01:52:05.257
No, not because I
dislike Mr. Heathcliff.


1218
01:52:06.458 --> 01:52:09.295
It's because Mr.
Heathcliff dislikes me.


1219
01:52:09.328 --> 01:52:12.331
Catherine, you
must listen to me.


1220
01:52:12.364 --> 01:52:15.934
He is the most diabolical
man, looking to wrong and ruin


1221
01:52:15.968 --> 01:52:18.237
those he hates given the
slightest opportunity.


1222
01:52:19.639 --> 01:52:21.940
I knew that you could not
keep acquaintance with Linton


1223
01:52:21.974 --> 01:52:24.510
without coming into contact
with Mr. Heathcliff.


1224
01:52:24.543 --> 01:52:27.946
But Mr. Heathcliff
was very cordial, Papa.


1225
01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:30.149
He didn't object to Linton
and I seeing each other.


1226
01:52:30.182 --> 01:52:32.551
But I do object, Catherine.

1227
01:52:32.585 --> 01:52:34.887
My reasons you would
not understand.


1228
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:38.157
You mother may still be
alive if it were not for him.


1229
01:52:38.190 --> 01:52:40.159
I will not see the
last person I love


1230
01:52:40.192 --> 01:52:42.161
in this world
suffer at his hand.


1231
01:52:48.567 --> 01:52:52.237
You are to stay away
from Wuthering Heights.


1232
01:53:01.213 --> 01:53:02.848
Dearest Catherine,

1233
01:53:07.186 --> 01:53:09.589
ever since I last
looked on to your face,


1234
01:53:09.622 --> 01:53:12.424
I have been able to
think of little else.


1235
01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:17.896
I would gladly think
of nothing else.


1236
01:53:21.233 --> 01:53:25.504
However, my memory
cannot compare


1237
01:53:27.707 --> 01:53:29.141
to your true form.

1238
01:53:38.217 --> 01:53:41.920
I am still not well enough to
make the trek to the Grange.


1239
01:53:43.322 --> 01:53:46.058
To understand this
world, to keep one's faith


1240
01:53:46.091 --> 01:53:49.161
in its deep meaning, to
reconcile the existence


1241
01:53:49.194 --> 01:53:51.063
of God to the existence of evil.

1242
01:53:51.096 --> 01:53:52.632
How should we picture heaven?

1243
01:53:58.036 --> 01:53:59.706
You
must find a way to defy


1244
01:53:59.739 --> 01:54:03.342
Uncle Edgar and see me
here, at the Heights.


1245
01:54:07.179 --> 01:54:08.013
How long have you been going

1246
01:54:08.046 --> 01:54:10.215
to Wuthering Heights,
Miss Catherine?


1247
01:54:10.249 --> 01:54:14.319
In a rustling green tree,
with bright white clouds,


1248
01:54:14.353 --> 01:54:19.091
and birds of all sorts
pouring music in at all sides.


1249
01:54:24.496 --> 01:54:26.699
Only a little while.

1250
01:54:26.733 --> 01:54:29.636
And it's only because Linton
is too ill to travel here.


1251
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:31.437
You should not
be risking so much


1252
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:33.606
to simply visit
with your cousin.


1253
01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.340
Nelly, I love him.

1254
01:54:35.374 --> 01:54:37.176
How should you picture heaven?

1255
01:54:38.410 --> 01:54:41.146
This, warm by
the fire, with you.


1256
01:54:43.348 --> 01:54:47.019
You've seen Linton but a
handful of times in your life.


1257
01:54:47.052 --> 01:54:48.454
He has the worst bit of
sickly slip that ever


1258
01:54:48.487 --> 01:54:51.023
struggled into his teens,
and I'm glad you have


1259
01:54:51.056 --> 01:54:52.759
no chance of having
him for a husband.


1260
01:54:52.792 --> 01:54:55.093
I will see him again.

1261
01:54:55.127 --> 01:54:55.961
If I had my
father's permission,


1262
01:54:55.994 --> 01:54:58.464
I'd spend half of
my time with you.


1263
01:54:58.497 --> 01:55:00.566
After Papa, I love you
better than anyone.


1264
01:55:01.233 --> 01:55:02.635
You'd love me better than him

1265
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:04.536
and all the world,
if you were my wife.


1266
01:55:08.273 --> 01:55:09.441
What are you laughing at?

1267
01:55:12.144 --> 01:55:13.746
People often hate their wives.

1268
01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:15.280
You are false.

1269
01:55:15.314 --> 01:55:17.282
Your father hated his wife.

1270
01:55:17.316 --> 01:55:18.618
Why do you say such a thing?

1271
01:55:18.651 --> 01:55:22.054
Your mother hated your
father, and loved his.


1272
01:55:22.087 --> 01:55:23.255
You liar!

1273
01:55:24.223 --> 01:55:25.758
You cruel-hearted fiend.

1274
01:55:26.793 --> 01:55:29.328
I will not remain another
moment in your company.


1275
01:55:29.361 --> 01:55:30.262
No, no.

1276
01:55:30.295 --> 01:55:32.164
Catherine, please don't leave.

1277
01:55:32.197 --> 01:55:33.700
You will come back, won't you?

1278
01:55:36.268 --> 01:55:38.303
Only if he's not here.

1279
01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:48.347
Your father's getting
worse by the day.


1280
01:55:51.651 --> 01:55:54.486
If he knew about your trysts,
it probably would kill him.


1281
01:55:58.791 --> 01:56:02.561
Stop this for his sake,
if not for your own.


1282
01:56:06.498 --> 01:56:08.768
With all my love, Linton.

1283
01:56:26.719 --> 01:56:31.256
Oh, Linton, I'm so sorry it
took me so long to get here.


1284
01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:33.158
I had to read my
father to sleep.


1285
01:56:34.359 --> 01:56:35.460
Good evening, Catherine.

1286
01:56:37.529 --> 01:56:39.464
It's been so long
since you've graced


1287
01:56:39.498 --> 01:56:41.099
my house with your presence.

1288
01:56:44.804 --> 01:56:46.305
My father is very ill.

1289
01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.208
The rumor goes he
is on his deathbed.


1290
01:56:51.343 --> 01:56:52.344
Is that an exaggeration?

1291
01:56:54.146 --> 01:56:55.080
I'm afraid not.

1292
01:56:57.449 --> 01:56:59.819
Well perhaps I can
console you with a gift.


1293
01:57:01.353 --> 01:57:02.622
I give you what I have.

1294
01:57:03.522 --> 01:57:04.824
It is hardly worth accepting,

1295
01:57:04.857 --> 01:57:07.225
but all that I have
to give you is my son.


1296
01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:09.896
What?

1297
01:57:09.929 --> 01:57:11.731
Father wants us to be married.

1298
01:57:11.764 --> 01:57:13.298
He knows Uncle Edgar
will not approve,


1299
01:57:13.332 --> 01:57:15.334
but he is wary of my dying.

1300
01:57:16.268 --> 01:57:19.371
Thus, we have to be
married in the morning,


1301
01:57:19.404 --> 01:57:21.373
and you can return to the
Grange in the morning.


1302
01:57:24.677 --> 01:57:26.545
I'm not afraid of you.

1303
01:57:26.579 --> 01:57:27.847
Give me the key.

1304
01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.381
Oh, you're not afraid of me.

1305
01:57:30.583 --> 01:57:32.517
Your courage is well disguised.

1306
01:57:42.527 --> 01:57:44.429
I'm afraid now,
because if I stay here


1307
01:57:44.463 --> 01:57:46.298
my father will be miserable.

1308
01:57:47.499 --> 01:57:49.636
Please, let me go home.

1309
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:52.905
I promise to marry your son
tomorrow if you let me go now.


1310
01:57:53.806 --> 01:57:56.408
I'll make sure you'll
keep your promise.


1311
01:57:56.441 --> 01:57:59.244
You will not leave this
house till I am your father.


1312
01:58:00.479 --> 01:58:03.215
The only father that you
will have in a few days.


1313
01:58:04.917 --> 01:58:07.519
At least send word to let
my father know I'm safe.


1314
01:58:09.722 --> 01:58:12.659
His happiest days were
over when yours began.


1315
01:58:14.727 --> 01:58:17.496
He cursed the day you
came into this world.


1316
01:58:21.366 --> 01:58:22.534
I did at least.

1317
01:58:27.707 --> 01:58:30.375
Heathcliff, you
are a cruel man,


1318
01:58:30.409 --> 01:58:31.611
but you are not a fiend.

1319
01:58:32.845 --> 01:58:34.614
If Father were to die
before I returned,


1320
01:58:34.647 --> 01:58:36.783
how could I bear to
live with myself?


1321
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:41.420
I'm going to kneel here
until you look at me.


1322
01:58:42.922 --> 01:58:43.890
Please.

1323
01:58:45.024 --> 01:58:48.928
Have you never loved anybody
in all your life, Uncle?


1324
01:58:50.462 --> 01:58:51.263
Ever?

1325
01:59:04.744 --> 01:59:07.345
Get your fingers off of me.

1326
01:59:10.282 --> 01:59:11.383
I detest you.

1327
01:59:47.053 --> 01:59:50.823
Hareton, please, tell
my father where I am.


1328
01:59:53.492 --> 01:59:54.292
Please?

1329
02:00:44.076 --> 02:00:44.911
Father.

1330
02:00:49.782 --> 02:00:50.750
Catherine.

1331
02:00:53.451 --> 02:00:55.487
Where have you been?

1332
02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:56.889
Out on the moors.

1333
02:00:58.825 --> 02:01:00.425
But I'm here now.

1334
02:01:02.494 --> 02:01:03.328
I'm here.

1335
02:01:09.001 --> 02:01:11.469
Well I can go to her now.

1336
02:01:17.577 --> 02:01:18.476
I love you.

1337
02:02:12.632 --> 02:02:15.835
I've come to fetch you home
to Wuthering Heights now.


1338
02:02:22.975 --> 02:02:24.944
Her father just died.

1339
02:02:24.977 --> 02:02:26.712
Is there no end to your cruelty?

1340
02:02:27.647 --> 02:02:30.448
I am seeking a tenant
now for this house,


1341
02:02:31.584 --> 02:02:33.786
and I want my children about me.

1342
02:02:42.695 --> 02:02:44.063
I can give you till morning.

1343
02:02:45.731 --> 02:02:47.700
Heathcliff, no.

1344
02:02:47.733 --> 02:02:49.068
I'll go, Nelly.

1345
02:02:54.607 --> 02:02:58.644
Linton is all I have to
love in the world now.


1346
02:02:58.678 --> 02:03:01.080
I know he has a simple nature,

1347
02:03:01.113 --> 02:03:05.918
but I know he loves me, and
for that reason I love him.


1348
02:03:28.774 --> 02:03:33.079
Mr. Heathcliff, you
have nobody to love you,


1349
02:03:34.313 --> 02:03:38.550
and however miserable you make
us, we will have the revenge


1350
02:03:38.584 --> 02:03:41.921
of knowing that cruelty
arises from your great misery.


1351
02:03:50.096 --> 02:03:52.131
Heathcliff.

1352
02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:42.114
Linton is dead.

1353
02:04:48.821 --> 02:04:50.723
How do you feel?

1354
02:04:50.756 --> 02:04:54.326
He's safe, and I'm free.

1355
02:04:56.762 --> 02:04:59.999
I should feel glad, but you
have left me so long to struggle


1356
02:05:00.032 --> 02:05:04.970
against death alone, now
I feel and see only death.


1357
02:05:13.679 --> 02:05:15.815
Here is Linton's will.

1358
02:05:15.848 --> 02:05:18.684
As you can see, he has
bequeathed all that was his


1359
02:05:18.717 --> 02:05:20.920
and all that had
been yours to me.


1360
02:05:22.254 --> 02:05:24.023
The Grange is mine.

1361
02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:49.882
Catherine stayed
in bed a fortnight.


1362
02:05:51.717 --> 02:05:54.186
When Mr. Heathcliff was
unsuccessful at finding a tenant


1363
02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:57.189
for the Grange, I offered my
services at Wuthering Heights.


1364
02:05:58.924 --> 02:06:01.827
Not even that would stir
my mistress from her bed.


1365
02:06:04.296 --> 02:06:05.831
And that brings us to now.

1366
02:06:11.971 --> 02:06:13.939
It is a remarkable tale.

1367
02:06:15.975 --> 02:06:16.976
I shall never forget it.

1368
02:06:18.777 --> 02:06:20.412
Now get some sleep, sir.

1369
02:06:20.446 --> 02:06:21.347
Quite all right.

1370
02:06:23.716 --> 02:06:24.850
I must collect my thoughts.

1371
02:06:30.956 --> 02:06:31.924
Oh, it is morning.

1372
02:06:35.895 --> 02:06:37.663
We've talked all
through the night.


1373
02:06:38.864 --> 02:06:40.232
I'll be going back
to the Grange now.


1374
02:06:41.767 --> 02:06:43.702
I must rid myself
of this awful place.


1375
02:06:46.906 --> 02:06:50.676
Thank you, Miss Dean, for the
accommodation and the insight.


1376
02:06:58.751 --> 02:07:00.853
I do wish there was more.

1377
02:07:22.908 --> 02:07:25.110
It's good to see
you, Miss Catherine.


1378
02:07:25.144 --> 02:07:26.478
Are you feeling any better?

1379
02:07:30.382 --> 02:07:31.383
I suppose.

1380
02:07:33.052 --> 02:07:34.954
I found some of
your mother's books.


1381
02:07:36.322 --> 02:07:38.123
Would you like to
read one to us?


1382
02:07:44.196 --> 02:07:47.032
I am well aware that some
people now begin to doubt


1383
02:07:47.066 --> 02:07:50.269
about witchcraft or, at
any rate, feign to do so.


1384
02:07:57.910 --> 02:08:00.980
How dare you touch
me? Get away from me!


1385
02:08:02.982 --> 02:08:05.084
I despise you.

1386
02:08:05.117 --> 02:08:07.820
I would have given my
life for one kind word


1387
02:08:07.853 --> 02:08:10.089
when you were my jailer,
but you kept off.


1388
02:08:10.122 --> 02:08:11.056
I asked Mr. Heathcliff...

1389
02:08:11.090 --> 02:08:12.825
Be silent!

1390
02:08:13.993 --> 02:08:14.927
I would rather be anywhere

1391
02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:17.963
than hear your detestable
voice in my ear.


1392
02:08:39.985 --> 02:08:42.788
Continual, continuous streef.

1393
02:08:45.357 --> 02:08:46.258
Str, strife, strife.

1394
02:08:48.127 --> 02:08:48.961
No, no.

1395
02:08:56.502 --> 02:08:58.037
Stay out of that room.

1396
02:09:26.298 --> 02:09:27.399
Strife.

1397
02:09:35.541 --> 02:09:38.177
He's just like the cart
horse, isn't he, Nelly?


1398
02:09:39.311 --> 02:09:42.414
He does his work,
he eats his food,


1399
02:09:42.448 --> 02:09:43.949
and sleeps eternally.

1400
02:09:45.451 --> 02:09:49.188
Do you ever dream, Hareton?

1401
02:09:49.221 --> 02:09:51.056
Hareton, can you hear me?

1402
02:09:51.090 --> 02:09:53.559
Go to the devil,
and let me be.


1403
02:09:53.593 --> 02:09:57.262
I have found that I want
and am glad to be your cousin.


1404
02:09:57.296 --> 02:09:59.431
Well I shall have
nothing to do with you


1405
02:09:59.465 --> 02:10:02.968
and your mucky pride
and damn mocking tricks.


1406
02:10:03.001 --> 02:10:04.403
I'll go to hell, body and soul,

1407
02:10:04.436 --> 02:10:06.606
before I look
sideways at you again.


1408
02:10:06.639 --> 02:10:08.507
You should be friends
with your cousin.


1409
02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:09.743
- Friends?
- Mm-hm.


1410
02:10:09.776 --> 02:10:13.312
When she hates me and thinks
me not fit to wipe her boots?


1411
02:10:13.345 --> 02:10:17.082
It is not I who hates
you. It is you who hates me.


1412
02:10:17.116 --> 02:10:19.485
You hate me as much as
Mr. Heathcliff does.


1413
02:10:19.518 --> 02:10:21.186
You're a damn liar.

1414
02:10:22.354 --> 02:10:24.223
Why have I made him angry then

1415
02:10:24.256 --> 02:10:26.392
by taking your part 100 times?

1416
02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:29.596
I didn't know
you took my part.


1417
02:10:38.705 --> 02:10:41.173
I was miserable and
bitter at everyone, but


1418
02:10:43.175 --> 02:10:44.109
now I thank you.

1419
02:10:45.745 --> 02:10:47.279
And ask you to forgive me.

1420
02:10:59.057 --> 02:11:00.092
Catherine.

1421
02:11:00.125 --> 02:11:02.027
What should I
have done, Nelly?


1422
02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:05.264
He wouldn't shake my hand,
and he wouldn't look.


1423
02:11:09.168 --> 02:11:13.105
Nelly, since Hareton
won't speak to me,


1424
02:11:14.106 --> 02:11:17.543
can you tell him that,
if he takes this book,


1425
02:11:17.577 --> 02:11:19.077
I'll teach him to read it?

1426
02:11:20.245 --> 02:11:22.281
And if he refuses
it, I'll go upstairs


1427
02:11:22.314 --> 02:11:24.249
and never tease him again.

1428
02:11:29.656 --> 02:11:30.723
Hareton.

1429
02:11:30.757 --> 02:11:32.692
You'll be ashamed of me
every day of your life,


1430
02:11:32.725 --> 02:11:34.627
and more ashamed the
more you know me.


1431
02:11:36.228 --> 02:11:38.230
So you won't be my friend?

1432
02:13:19.431 --> 02:13:22.401
I thought I had cured
you of your laughing.


1433
02:13:22.434 --> 02:13:23.435
It was me.

1434
02:13:26.706 --> 02:13:30.843
Mr. Heathcliff, might I
plant a small flower garden


1435
02:13:30.877 --> 02:13:32.444
on the north side of the house?

1436
02:13:33.378 --> 02:13:34.279
No.

1437
02:13:34.313 --> 02:13:35.615
She already has.

1438
02:13:38.383 --> 02:13:40.620
What is your
grievance, Joseph?


1439
02:13:40.653 --> 02:13:44.523
Her and Hareton, they pulled
up three of my fine firs.


1440
02:13:44.556 --> 02:13:48.427
She's bewitched the lad with
bold eyes and forward ways.


1441
02:13:53.565 --> 02:13:54.801
Pull the flowers up.

1442
02:13:57.637 --> 02:14:00.238
How can you begrudge
me a few yards of earth


1443
02:14:00.272 --> 02:14:01.641
when you have taken all my land?

1444
02:14:01.674 --> 02:14:05.277
Your land? You insolent slut.

1445
02:14:07.412 --> 02:14:08.380
You never had any.

1446
02:14:08.413 --> 02:14:09.514
And my money.

1447
02:14:11.918 --> 02:14:12.819
Enough.

1448
02:14:12.852 --> 02:14:14.353
And Hareton's land and money.

1449
02:14:16.355 --> 02:14:18.658
If you strike me,
Hareton will strike you,


1450
02:14:18.691 --> 02:14:20.459
so you might as well sit down.

1451
02:14:22.527 --> 02:14:26.465
Don't intend to
rouse him against me.


1452
02:14:37.409 --> 02:14:41.213
You should avoid putting
me into a passion.


1453
02:14:45.885 --> 02:14:48.153
Take her out of my sight.

1454
02:15:09.876 --> 02:15:12.244
Why don't you eat, Papa?

1455
02:15:19.384 --> 02:15:20.419
Go.

1456
02:15:24.023 --> 02:15:27.359
I don't know how you can
stand to be away from her.


1457
02:15:29.261 --> 02:15:30.195
Go, please.

1458
02:15:32.497 --> 02:15:33.331
Please.

1459
02:15:34.967 --> 02:15:35.868
Leave me.

1460
02:16:05.297 --> 02:16:06.966
Heathcliff.

1461
02:16:54.981 --> 02:16:58.517
It is a poor conclusion,
is it not, Nelly?


1462
02:17:00.586 --> 02:17:02.454
My old enemies
have not beaten me,


1463
02:17:02.487 --> 02:17:04.724
and now is the precise time

1464
02:17:04.757 --> 02:17:08.393
to revenge myself
on their children.


1465
02:17:08.426 --> 02:17:11.664
I could do it, and no
one could hinder me.


1466
02:17:19.504 --> 02:17:20.840
Where's the use?

1467
02:17:22.541 --> 02:17:25.578
I have lost the sense
of their destruction.


1468
02:17:26.879 --> 02:17:27.880
Want a cup of tea?

1469
02:17:29.582 --> 02:17:31.684
There is a strange
change, Nelly.


1470
02:17:34.519 --> 02:17:37.657
In every tree, in every cloud,

1471
02:17:38.624 --> 02:17:41.627
filling the air at night
and caught by glimpses


1472
02:17:41.661 --> 02:17:43.562
in every object by day.

1473
02:17:47.099 --> 02:17:49.602
I am surrounded by her image.

1474
02:18:00.947 --> 02:18:05.017
The most ordinary faces
mock me with resemblance.


1475
02:18:06.185 --> 02:18:08.553
The entire world is
a dreadful memorandum


1476
02:18:08.588 --> 02:18:10.990
that she did exist
and I have lost her.


1477
02:18:15.728 --> 02:18:19.665
I cannot continue in
this condition, Cathy.


1478
02:18:19.699 --> 02:18:20.666
I have a single wish,

1479
02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:23.736
and my entire being is
yearning to attain it.


1480
02:18:24.704 --> 02:18:27.640
I have yearned for so
long and so unwaveringly


1481
02:18:27.673 --> 02:18:29.809
that I am convinced
it must be reached


1482
02:18:29.842 --> 02:18:32.945
because it has
devoured my existence.


1483
02:18:46.659 --> 02:18:48.661
It has been long flight,

1484
02:18:50.997 --> 02:18:53.498
and I wish it were over.

1485
02:20:39.638 --> 02:20:40.706
Heathcliff.

1486
02:20:51.751 --> 02:20:54.653
Whereas the
contrary brings bliss


1487
02:20:55.721 --> 02:20:58.891
and is a pattern
of celestial peace.


1488
02:21:57.883 --> 02:22:00.653
To you, I've made myself
worse than the devil.


1489
02:23:42.888 --> 02:23:44.757
Morning, Heathcliff.

1490
02:23:49.261 --> 02:23:50.829
Heathcliff?

1491
02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:19.325
Joseph.

1492
02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:22.394
Joseph!

1493
02:24:30.102 --> 02:24:31.337
Hareton!

1494
02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:23.155
And still, I don't like
being by myself in this house.


1495
02:25:23.889 --> 02:25:25.057
I cannot help it.

1496
02:25:25.090 --> 02:25:26.025
I should be glad
when they leave it


1497
02:25:26.058 --> 02:25:27.493
and shift over to the Grange.

1498
02:25:29.128 --> 02:25:31.096
Hareton and Catherine are
going to the Grange then?


1499
02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:34.233
Aye, as soon as they're
married on New Year's Day.


1500
02:25:34.266 --> 02:25:35.834
Since you're
vacating the Grange,


1501
02:25:35.868 --> 02:25:38.270
there's no use for you
staying in this dreary house.


1502
02:25:39.538 --> 02:25:40.973
Who would live here then?

1503
02:25:41.006 --> 02:25:42.941
Joseph will take
care of the house,


1504
02:25:42.975 --> 02:25:44.410
but the rest of it
will be shut up.


1505
02:25:46.945 --> 02:25:49.348
For the use of such ghosts
that choose to inhabit it.


1506
02:25:51.584 --> 02:25:52.418
Nay.

1507
02:25:53.986 --> 02:25:56.021
I believe the dead
are at last at peace.


1508
02:25:59.425 --> 02:26:01.360
They are afraid of nothing.

1509
02:26:01.393 --> 02:26:04.897
Together, they would brave
Satan and all his legion.


1510
02:27:03.155 --> 02:27:06.125
I wonder how anyone can
imagine unquiet slumbers


1511
02:27:06.892 --> 02:27:09.161
for the sleepers in
that quiet earth.
