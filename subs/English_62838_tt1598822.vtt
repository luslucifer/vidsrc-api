1
00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:01.436
Some people swear there's no beauty
left in the world. No magic.


2
00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:05.823
Then how do you explain the entire world
coming together on one night...


3
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:09.781
...to celebrate the hope of a new year?

4
00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:16.454
Ready.

5
00:01:16.617 --> 00:01:17.709
Pull!

6
00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:21.418
Ease it off. Ease it. Gently.

7
00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:26.965
Well done, boys. We'll pack up the tarp.
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day.


8
00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:29.255
Hello, Your Majesty. Ha-ha-ha.

9
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.303
We wanna see a show of strength...

10
00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.217
...from the New York City Police Department.

11
00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:44.190
Good morning, this is Ryan Seacrest
here in New York...


12
00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:49.280
...where the crowds of revelers are already
beginning to arrive in Times Square.


13
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:52.240
I'll be coming at
you all day on radio...

14
00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:58.455
...and all night live from the center of
it all, so bundle up and stay tuned.


15
00:02:07.584 --> 00:02:11.430
Good morning, Claire! They need
you up here for an interview.


16
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.055
This is Claire Morgan. 
She's in charge.

17
00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:21.148
Mind giving us a
sound bite for the newscast?

18
00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:22.899
No, I'd be happy to.

19
00:02:23.058 --> 00:02:27.359
I'm talking to Claire Morgan, the new vice
president of the Times Square Alliance.


20
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:28.943
So big night.

21
00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:31.108
Well, I'd say that's an understatement.

22
00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:34.949
Over a billion people all over the world
will have their eyes on us tonight...


23
00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:40.460
...as the ball drops, so I'd say that
qualifies as a very big night.


24
00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:43.207
Am I looking in
the right spot for camera?

25
00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.164
Oh, um...

26
00:02:45.372 --> 00:02:46.419
We're radio.

27
00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:49.877
Right. Of course.

28
00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:53.221
This is 14th and Park.

29
00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.065
Oh! Oh! Uhn.

30
00:03:07.227 --> 00:03:09.855
Are you all right, lady? 
Are you all right?

31
00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:12.570
Here.

32
00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:15.156
No, I'm fine, I'm
fine, I'm fine. Go away.

33
00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:36.055
Yeah, what's up, girls?
How you doing? All right?

34
00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:39.475
Yo, I see you, player. Ha.

35
00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:43.518
Oh, oh, hey, Happy New Year. 
Happy New Year.

36
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.102
Yeah, you too.

37
00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:51.655
Sign this, but you
can't check in until tonight.

38
00:03:51.813 --> 00:03:53.565
No problem. We'll be back tonight.

39
00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:56.235
- We're gonna win the money.
- Oh, of course you are.


40
00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:57.573
What money?

41
00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:01.957
Oh, the first baby delivered in the new
year at this hospital gets 25 grand.


42
00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:04.834
No, no, no, honey. 
I think it's much less than that.

43
00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:07.837
- No, it's 25 grand.
- Twenty-five grand?


44
00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:11.341
Honey, you're mistaken. 
It's much less.

45
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.051
Plus, after taxes and all the red tape,
you end up with no money.


46
00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.804
Did I mention the news cameras in
your face right after giving birth?


47
00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.185
That's horrible. 
It's not worth it at all.

48
00:04:22.344 --> 00:04:26.190
It's 25 grand. They could put the camera
in my hoo-ha and it'd be worth it.


49
00:04:26.348 --> 00:04:27.440
In your hoo-ha!

50
00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.522
- In my hoo-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.


51
00:04:29.684 --> 00:04:30.856
Mr. and Mrs. Byrne?

52
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:32.396
- That's us.
- Right this way.


53
00:04:34.147 --> 00:04:35.569
Come on, Grace. 
Let's go home.

54
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:42.073
Hmm.

55
00:04:44.658 --> 00:04:46.626
Okay. Let's figure out how to induce.

56
00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.208
- I will ask the Internet right now.
- By command.


57
00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:51.294
This could pay off my student loan.

58
00:04:58.922 --> 00:05:02.643
Okay, honey, the hallway looks great. Very festive.

59
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.145
This could be a little higher. 
Hand me that tape.

60
00:05:05.303 --> 00:05:08.807
Here you go. It looks beautiful. 
You did a nice job.

61
00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:12.649
Why you volunteered to decorate the floor
I'll never know, but it looks great.


62
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:13.858
Oh, hush up.

63
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.772
Come on, we gotta get dressed for work.

64
00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.941
- Let's call in sick.
- Mm.


65
00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:29.210
- Hey, Paul.
- My dog.


66
00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:31.417
- What are we doing tonight?
- You're working.


67
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.002
I'm not. So leave me alone.

68
00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:36.885
Randy, listen to me, don't do this right
now. Don't go into your black hole.


69
00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:39.592
It's midnight on New Year's Eve.

70
00:05:39.754 --> 00:05:41.552
We have to do something. 
Not an option.

71
00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:45.891
What, are you still on this anti-New Year's
kick, bro? Get over yourself. Now.


72
00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:50.774
You know what? It's not a kick.
It's a core tenet of my being.


73
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.944
Like I said, I get the day off...

74
00:05:54.102 --> 00:05:58.858
...so I'm gonna hang in our apartment
by myself and do nothing, and love it.


75
00:05:59.524 --> 00:06:02.744
It's my job as your best friend
to just ignore you right now...


76
00:06:02.903 --> 00:06:04.871
...because you sound crazy.

77
00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:08.746
I'm not being crazy!

78
00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:14.756
Okay, I'm gonna find something so epic
that you will not be able to say no.


79
00:06:16.124 --> 00:06:17.876
Hmm.

80
00:06:18.084 --> 00:06:21.759
I got a funny feeling, 
Paul, that I'm gonna say no.

81
00:06:21.922 --> 00:06:25.768
You want to throw the challenge flag
in my face? Okay. I'll call you back.


82
00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:26.973
Save your minutes.

83
00:06:28.386 --> 00:06:29.683
Now we're talking.

84
00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:35.519
By the power vested in me by
the state of Connecticut...


85
00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:40.657
...Rory and Trish, 
I now pronounce you man and wife.

86
00:06:40.815 --> 00:06:43.364
You may give kisses to the missus.

87
00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:48.706
My cousin will pay you.

88
00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:51.744
Oh. Congratulations to both of
you. That was just beautiful.


89
00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:53.545
Thank you all for coming.

90
00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:57.879
We wanted to save money for the honeymoon.

91
00:07:01.962 --> 00:07:03.589
Well, you're the last of us, Sam.

92
00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:07.760
Roam the plains of Manhattan and carry
on the legacy of late-night barhopping...


93
00:07:07.926 --> 00:07:10.770
...and casual sex with
random women in good shoes.

94
00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:13.648
- Which Rory will never know again.
- Mm.


95
00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:18.024
For better or worse, I can see why
the man's crazy about you.


96
00:07:18.228 --> 00:07:19.605
Aww..

97
00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:22.778
I'm out of here.

98
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:25.114
- You can't stay for breakfast?
- Rain check.


99
00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:28.075
Office has been calling all morning.
I really gotta get back.


100
00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:30.912
- I got that big speech tonight.
- What about the girl?


101
00:07:31.074 --> 00:07:33.327
- What girl?
- The one you met last New Year's Eve?


102
00:07:33.493 --> 00:07:36.667
- Are you gonna meet her tonight?
- It was a year ago. We've moved on.


103
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.127
Hey, look at you two.

104
00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:40.626
All married.

105
00:07:42.502 --> 00:07:44.049
- Here they come!
- Congratulations!


106
00:07:44.212 --> 00:07:45.634
No, no, no. These two. Here.

107
00:07:45.797 --> 00:07:47.595
- All right. I'll see you.
- Bye, Sam.


108
00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:50.351
Hey, there's someone out
there for you too, buddy.

109
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.932
All right.

110
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:05.488
Okay.

111
00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:11.081
All right. Our first event with linen napkins.

112
00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:15.460
Not only are we now eco-friendly, but this
will be our biggest A-list party to date.


113
00:08:15.618 --> 00:08:19.464
I know it's cold, okay? But we cannot
mess this up. So you gotta focus.


114
00:08:19.622 --> 00:08:22.341
- Where is Ava?
- She thinks she saw a celebrity somewhere.


115
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.844
There's gonna be more celebrities here than rehab.

116
00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:28.348
Okay, Sunil, make sure we have
all the booze on this list.


117
00:08:28.506 --> 00:08:31.976
Find Ava and then I'll meet you in the
lobby after I scout the kitchen.


118
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.143
- Ava!
- Take a picture with the bus.


119
00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:38.354
- I'm freaking out.
- Ava, there is no time for freaking out.


120
00:08:38.516 --> 00:08:43.238
I can't help it. Do you see that bus?
I saw it when I went to his concert.


121
00:08:43.396 --> 00:08:44.522
It's Jensen!

122
00:08:44.689 --> 00:08:45.906
That's Jensen's bus?

123
00:08:46.608 --> 00:08:48.155
The Jensen?

124
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:49.777
That's fantastic.

125
00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:53.658
- I love it.
- Aah!


126
00:08:54.324 --> 00:08:55.325
- Ooh! 'Yee!

127
00:08:55.492 --> 00:08:56.744
Keep jumping!

128
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.833
You are very sexy, but don't stop.

129
00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:01.339
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy!

130
00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:08.012
Now don't be sad

131
00:09:10.256 --> 00:09:14.352
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

132
00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:16.639
Jensen! Jensen! Jensen!

133
00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:23.270
You know, I know him personally.

134
00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:27.361
Everybody, let's get as much prep
done in the kitchen as possible.


135
00:09:27.524 --> 00:09:30.619
And any sauces that need
to get done can start now.

136
00:09:30.777 --> 00:09:32.996
And I'll check the deliveries
up in the lobby. Oh.

137
00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:37.284
Anyone who can, can you please help Sunil
and Ava unload the truck? That'd be great.


138
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.465
Ay-ay-ay. Laura. You're not going
to believe who is here.


139
00:09:43.623 --> 00:09:44.670
Jensen.

140
00:09:44.833 --> 00:09:48.212
How did you know? 
Are you psychotic?

141
00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:51.260
It's "psychic." And do me a favor. 
If you see him...

142
00:09:51.422 --> 00:09:55.598
...tell him to avoid the blond in the
kitchen with the really big knife.


143
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.058
Ay, Laura, do you know him?

144
00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:01.900
It's good to see you, Laura.

145
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.577
Are you still there?

146
00:10:13.736 --> 00:10:17.957
Do you think Jensen will sign a banana?
I don't have any paper.


147
00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:25.791
All right. Working on those resolutions, huh?

148
00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:28.585
- No.
- Okay.


149
00:10:28.751 --> 00:10:32.096
I have a delivery
here for Mr. Jonathan Cox.

150
00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:33.632
Do you work here?

151
00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:35.800
No. I work for a courier service.

152
00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:39.437
I've been delivering packages to you
for about, I don't know, a year now.


153
00:10:39.596 --> 00:10:43.191
But I think this is maybe the first time
you've ever looked me in the eye.


154
00:10:43.349 --> 00:10:44.601
How you doing?

155
00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:47.024
Sorry.

156
00:10:47.187 --> 00:10:50.282
That's actually an old resolution.
Make more eye contact.


157
00:10:51.566 --> 00:10:53.614
So those were New Year's resolutions, huh?

158
00:10:53.776 --> 00:10:55.870
Looks like a long list. 
You better get on it.

159
00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:58.282
I don't know, maybe next year.

160
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.329
Whoa. Jeez! Are you serious?

161
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.123
That is a hot ticket.

162
00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:09.167
- Really?
- It's amazing.


163
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.673
They have the best food, the best music.

164
00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.634
They got so many single girls.

165
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.475
And it's a masquerade, so you don't even
have to worry about their faces.


166
00:11:17.634 --> 00:11:19.853
You kind of just use your imagination.

167
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.981
If anybody tries to kick you out,
or even asks who you are...


168
00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:25.642
...you just straight-up lie. 
What are they gonna do?

169
00:11:25.808 --> 00:11:26.980
It's brilliant.

170
00:11:27.143 --> 00:11:29.646
It's like Facebook, but real.

171
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:31.773
I remember who you are now.

172
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.283
Right, exactly.

173
00:11:33.566 --> 00:11:36.319
Anyways, I would give my left--

174
00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:41.790
Well, maybe next year.

175
00:11:49.749 --> 00:11:51.592
Oh, there she is.

176
00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:55.888
- You ready?
- Let's go talk to them.


177
00:12:01.052 --> 00:12:03.555
- Hey, Hailey. You good?
- Yeah, we're good, Seth.


178
00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:05.439
All right. Well, let's go, fellas.

179
00:12:05.598 --> 00:12:09.148
We need to scout our pen on 54th and
head home to gear up for tonight.


180
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.779
- I'm gonna see you there, right?
- Yeah, definitely.


181
00:12:11.938 --> 00:12:14.612
- Well, I'll see you there.
- See you.


182
00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:17.694
- Ooh.
- You are so gonna kiss Seth tonight!


183
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.161
I really just, like, haven't even thought
about it at all. It's no big deal.


184
00:12:22.323 --> 00:12:23.540
Do you know how to kiss?

185
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.953
They have a video on
the Internet that shows you.

186
00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:29.714
Two. One for regular kissing, and
one for passionate kissing.


187
00:12:29.872 --> 00:12:34.594
All right, guys. Yeah, I know how to kiss, so
it's fine. It's not a big deal. Okay, we--


188
00:12:34.752 --> 00:12:37.847
Hey, what about your mom? 
What's she doing?

189
00:12:39.007 --> 00:12:40.475
Got it!

190
00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:45.389
Oh, and remember, it's just a quarter of an
inch at the center back of the collar, okay?


191
00:12:45.555 --> 00:12:47.273
Okay, let me take a look at that.

192
00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:49.150
Kim, is that your New Year's dress?

193
00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:53.735
Oh, it's just something I'm
working on for a rainy day.

194
00:12:53.896 --> 00:12:57.070
You should wear it tonight. Maybe
you'll scare up a little action.


195
00:12:57.233 --> 00:12:58.450
That's highly doubtful.

196
00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:02.534
The only action I've got is Hailey and me
watching the ball drop at midnight.


197
00:13:02.697 --> 00:13:06.076
Last New Year's Eve she was with
her father. So it's my turn.


198
00:13:06.576 --> 00:13:09.625
- Wanna join us?
- Wow, really tempting.


199
00:13:09.787 --> 00:13:12.836
I don't think you understand. Hailey
likes staying in with me.


200
00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:14.376
- All dancers on-stage!
- Go.


201
00:13:14.542 --> 00:13:17.295
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.


202
00:13:17.462 --> 00:13:18.839
Five, six, seven, eight.

203
00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:42.154
- New York.
- New Rochelle.


204
00:13:42.362 --> 00:13:44.410
- New Brunswick.
- New York-- New York City.


205
00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:45.619
New Haven.

206
00:13:45.782 --> 00:13:47.125
New Britain.

207
00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:49.453
New Hartford.

208
00:13:50.078 --> 00:13:51.125
New Jersey?

209
00:13:51.496 --> 00:13:52.964
New York!

210
00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:54.795
New York. Turn right.

211
00:13:54.957 --> 00:13:56.880
Left for New York.

212
00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:03.933
Oh! Oh.

213
00:14:04.092 --> 00:14:05.309
Oh, my nose.

214
00:14:05.468 --> 00:14:06.970
Airbags deployed.

215
00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:08.980
The genny truck's not arrived yet.

216
00:14:09.138 --> 00:14:11.766
Will someone tell me
why it isn't here yet?

217
00:14:11.933 --> 00:14:14.277
Make sure Jensen's on schedule for his soundcheck.

218
00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:16.813
He's playing some party,
but this is Times Square.

219
00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:18.322
She's a little on edge today.

220
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:20.233
Ready for the confetti test.

221
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.027
Brendan.

222
00:14:22.652 --> 00:14:25.371
Good to see you. 
I thought you were with your family.

223
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.410
I was, then I realized you wouldn't make
it through the big night without me.


224
00:14:29.575 --> 00:14:31.293
- Wow, I'm really touched.
- Heh.


225
00:14:31.452 --> 00:14:33.830
I'm trying not to say
this, but if I screw up--

226
00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:37.967
- You won't.
- I don't know. I'm not off to a great start.


227
00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:39.506
The generator truck is late.

228
00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:42.923
I mugged for the camera during a radio
interview. Can you believe it?


229
00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:45.012
You'll make it happen.

230
00:14:45.174 --> 00:14:47.347
And you'll make it
on time for your meeting.

231
00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:50.308
- We're not talking about my meeting.
- And why not?


232
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:52.815
I should've never told you about that.

233
00:14:52.974 --> 00:14:54.772
Look. Come here, lookit.

234
00:14:55.435 --> 00:14:57.858
They're testing the confetti for tonight.

235
00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:02.651
Don't just dump them!

236
00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:05.821
Float them in the wind. 
It should be magical.

237
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.872
I'm so glad you're here.

238
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.418
Laura, I know you're upset. All right?

239
00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:23.338
- Mr. Jensen, I play piano.
- I just play.


240
00:15:23.504 --> 00:15:25.051
Thank you, thank you.

241
00:15:25.923 --> 00:15:29.723
- Laura, it's been a year already.
- I have nothing to say to you, Daniel.


242
00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:32.514
- "Daniel."
- She knows Mr. Jensen.


243
00:15:33.097 --> 00:15:34.474
Hello, secrets.

244
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.893
Look at me. Just look at me.

245
00:15:40.021 --> 00:15:43.195
- That was quite a slap.
- I've been plotting that slap all year.


246
00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:45.993
How I would walk up to
you when you least expect it...

247
00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:49.156
...and slap you across the
face for leaving me like that.

248
00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:51.657
And you know what?

249
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.169
It wasn't nearly as satisfying
as I thought it would be.

250
00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:58.756
- Aah!
- Ooh.


251
00:15:58.998 --> 00:16:01.877
- That was closer.
- We're just fooling around.


252
00:16:02.251 --> 00:16:04.253
- I like fooling around too.
- Come back.


253
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.548
I tried to call you. 
You never called me back.

254
00:16:06.714 --> 00:16:09.513
I left you tickets, you never showed
up. Talk to me, damn it.


255
00:16:09.675 --> 00:16:12.053
- Just talk to me.
- Just talk to him.


256
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.894
Because it's New Year's Eve,
you want another shot at it?


257
00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:18.693
You walked out on me, Daniel. 
I think that says it all.

258
00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:22.105
I didn't even get to make you
one dinner in that apartment.


259
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:25.115
You walked out before I unpacked
the first bag of groceries.


260
00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:31.581
Celebrities. They're just like us.

261
00:16:33.783 --> 00:16:37.913
Mr. Cox? Is there a reason you
asked me to work today?


262
00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:40.836
- It's your job.
- Of course.


263
00:16:40.998 --> 00:16:43.092
It's just that it's New Year's Eve...

264
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:47.552
...and I thought maybe you wanted
to give me my end-of-year bonus.


265
00:16:48.464 --> 00:16:50.432
- Seeing that it's the end of the year.
- Oh.


266
00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:53.310
Right. Almost slipped my mind. Mm.

267
00:16:54.804 --> 00:16:57.478
- Glad to remind you, sir.
- Well, unfortunately...


268
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.938
...it has been a
tough year for Ahern Records.

269
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:01.523
I don't have to tell you.

270
00:17:01.852 --> 00:17:04.981
Music piracy, blah, blah, blah.

271
00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:10.324
Have I got your name right?

272
00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:16.326
Yes, it's just that I wanted to
use my bonus to book a trip.


273
00:17:16.492 --> 00:17:18.995
Well, that might get you to Staten Island.

274
00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:20.287
Maybe next year.

275
00:17:20.454 --> 00:17:23.253
It's just that I already booked
my two weeks' vacation time.


276
00:17:23.416 --> 00:17:25.214
Two weeks? Did I sign off?

277
00:17:27.003 --> 00:17:29.631
You don't need to, sir. It goes
through Human Resources.


278
00:17:29.797 --> 00:17:33.267
No, it goes through me. And I can't
do without you for two weeks.


279
00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:34.598
You can have one week.

280
00:17:37.054 --> 00:17:40.183
Well, then...

281
00:17:41.183 --> 00:17:42.355
...I'll take two weeks...

282
00:17:43.227 --> 00:17:44.945
...and my stapler.

283
00:17:45.605 --> 00:17:46.857
I quit.

284
00:17:48.149 --> 00:17:49.867
You can't quit, it's Grammy season!

285
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.078
L...

286
00:17:52.528 --> 00:17:53.780
I almost died today, sir.

287
00:17:53.946 --> 00:17:56.244
No, no. You look fine.

288
00:17:56.407 --> 00:17:58.284
Can you get me a coffee?

289
00:18:03.456 --> 00:18:04.753
Don't forget the sugar!

290
00:18:04.915 --> 00:18:07.634
Come on, three stars! 
I need three stars!

291
00:18:13.507 --> 00:18:15.635
Jonathan Cox's office. Please hold.

292
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.978
- Look out!
- Oh, God. No, don't


293
00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:24.143
I have hated him
for leaving me like that.

294
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:26.563
- No, don't do the egg.
- Then he just shows up...


295
00:18:26.729 --> 00:18:30.734
...on the biggest night of my career!
What kind of karma is that? Huh?


296
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.743
What, that you made love with Jensen...

297
00:18:32.902 --> 00:18:35.530
...or that you're catering the
biggest party in the city?

298
00:18:35.696 --> 00:18:37.448
Because all I'm hearing is good.

299
00:18:39.283 --> 00:18:40.751
- Can I do one?
- Yeah.


300
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.379
- The expensive eggs?
- They feel good.


301
00:18:43.663 --> 00:18:44.710
Oh.

302
00:18:45.206 --> 00:18:46.423
Oh, that was so sissy.

303
00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.256
I'm delicate girl.

304
00:18:51.337 --> 00:18:53.465
Dr. Trokin to Radiation Therapy.

305
00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:55.933
Dr. Trokin to Radiation Therapy.

306
00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:59.562
- Hey, doc.
- Yes, Mr. Harris.


307
00:18:59.929 --> 00:19:01.931
I haven't asked you for anything, have I?

308
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.938
No. No, you haven't.

309
00:19:05.726 --> 00:19:07.649
No chemo...

310
00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:12.025
...no radiation, nothing that could give
you an extra couple of months.


311
00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:14.702
So then you owe me one.

312
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.988
Sure, Mr. Harris. 
What do you need?

313
00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:20.450
Did I tell you
why I picked this hospital?

314
00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:22.994
Because of the quality of the doctors?

315
00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:27.628
The roof has a great view of the New
Year's Eve ball drop in Times Square.


316
00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:31.761
I heard you say I
was living on borrowed time.

317
00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:33.466
I don't recall telling you that.

318
00:19:33.629 --> 00:19:35.552
I heard you tell the nurses.

319
00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:37.388
I'm dying, I'm not deaf.

320
00:19:39.009 --> 00:19:41.353
Well, you've certainly surprised us, Mr. Harris.

321
00:19:42.638 --> 00:19:46.609
But be honest, there really isn't anyone
we can notify? No one at all?


322
00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:51.113
The only people who ever cared about me,
I pissed off long ago. There's no one.


323
00:19:52.189 --> 00:19:53.532
Doc, come on.

324
00:19:53.733 --> 00:19:56.657
Call it a dying man's last wish.

325
00:19:57.027 --> 00:20:01.749
Please, come on. I've been hanging on this
long just so I can see the ball drop...


326
00:20:02.533 --> 00:20:04.160
...one more time.

327
00:20:05.661 --> 00:20:08.414
- You know, it's cold out there.
- I'll live.


328
00:20:09.623 --> 00:20:13.969
- You can see it much better on TV.
- I don't wanna see it on TV, doc, please.


329
00:20:14.128 --> 00:20:19.180
As much as I'd like to help you, it's against
hospital policy to allow anyone on the roof.


330
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:21.764
Just forget it. 
Forget I asked.

331
00:20:22.136 --> 00:20:25.436
- Okay. If there's anything else you need...
- No, nothing.


332
00:20:25.598 --> 00:20:28.351
- ...just have the nurses page me, okay?
- Yeah.


333
00:20:28.601 --> 00:20:30.148
Okay.

334
00:20:32.688 --> 00:20:34.986
See if you can
get him to eat something.

335
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:36.696
Did he change his mind?

336
00:20:36.859 --> 00:20:40.705
Nope. No treatment, just
palliative meds at this point.

337
00:20:40.863 --> 00:20:43.833
- I guess it's time for hospice.
- No time.


338
00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:46.786
Well, is he gonna make it until tomorrow?

339
00:20:46.952 --> 00:20:48.044
It's doubtful.

340
00:20:55.669 --> 00:21:00.175
Another thing that chaps my ass about the
holiday season is all the fake niceness.


341
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:03.470
Like, today I received 50 text messages...

342
00:21:03.636 --> 00:21:05.934
...with a generic "Happy New Year"...

343
00:21:06.096 --> 00:21:08.599
...from people who hit
"send" to their address book.

344
00:21:08.766 --> 00:21:12.896
Most of them I haven't heard from
since last year. Call me back.


345
00:21:15.105 --> 00:21:17.233
Oh, hey, hold the elevator.

346
00:21:17.525 --> 00:21:19.744
- I'm going down.
- Oh, wait, wait.


347
00:21:19.902 --> 00:21:21.904
- Honestly--
- Me too.


348
00:21:23.322 --> 00:21:26.246
Yeah, I tore down the decorations.

349
00:21:27.159 --> 00:21:31.255
According to the lease agreement, you're
not supposed to decorate the hallways.


350
00:21:32.248 --> 00:21:34.250
Not my decorations.

351
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.064
- Yep.
- No, no, no. This can't be happening.


352
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.278
I have somewhere that I need to be.

353
00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:02.787
Hello? Hello? Hello?

354
00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:05.073
- Wait, this thing is dead!
- It doesn't work.


355
00:22:05.239 --> 00:22:07.116
Well, call the super.

356
00:22:07.283 --> 00:22:08.626
He doesn't work either.

357
00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:10.419
- No reception.
- Oh, no.


358
00:22:10.578 --> 00:22:12.956
Oh, you're the new girl from 5B.

359
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.713
Why aren't you more panicked right now?

360
00:22:16.876 --> 00:22:19.925
Oh, I don't know. 
I don't really have anywhere to be.

361
00:22:21.088 --> 00:22:25.059
Hello? Hello, this is 5B! This is 5B!

362
00:22:25.217 --> 00:22:27.060
I'm stuck in this elevator!

363
00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:29.017
I'm gonna be late for work.

364
00:22:32.182 --> 00:22:33.809
False alarm, dear ones.

365
00:22:33.976 --> 00:22:37.196
- But everything's okay, right?
- Oh, everything looks very good.


366
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.698
Hmm...

367
00:22:43.152 --> 00:22:47.282
We close both eyes so that we
may see through the other.


368
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.991
Close them.

369
00:22:49.158 --> 00:22:50.205
No.

370
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:56.716
Hmm. Labor could be any day now.

371
00:22:58.334 --> 00:22:59.426
Any day?

372
00:22:59.668 --> 00:23:03.093
Don't worry, I know you wanna
have a very natural childbirth...


373
00:23:03.255 --> 00:23:06.759
...no epidural, no pitocin, we're gonna
use the hypnobirthing techniques.


374
00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:10.931
We were actually just kind of wondering
if we could schedule a C-section.


375
00:23:11.096 --> 00:23:14.145
Just, you know, kind of get this
show on the road, am I right?


376
00:23:14.308 --> 00:23:16.356
- Yeah.
- Uh, we were thinking, um...


377
00:23:16.644 --> 00:23:18.646
...maybe tonight-ish.

378
00:23:18.812 --> 00:23:21.156
Midnight-ish. Uh...

379
00:23:21.315 --> 00:23:22.612
- Right? Griff, right?
- Yeah.


380
00:23:22.775 --> 00:23:25.494
We were both thinking that maybe
tonight could work better.


381
00:23:25.653 --> 00:23:28.907
- If we could do tonight that would be great.
- Tonight?


382
00:23:29.198 --> 00:23:30.620
Hmm.

383
00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:36.498
You want me to come in on New Year's Eve
at midnight and perform a C-section?


384
00:23:37.665 --> 00:23:38.757
Is it New Year's?

385
00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:41.510
- Oh, boy. Weird.
- It is. Yeah.


386
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:43.797
- I completely just forgot.
- I did too.


387
00:23:43.963 --> 00:23:45.931
- I think with all this.
- Pregnancy brain.


388
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.515
We were never really New Year's people.
We're more Memorial Day people.


389
00:23:49.677 --> 00:23:51.395
Let me be clear.

390
00:23:52.137 --> 00:23:56.392
I will not schedule a C-section just
so you can win some money.


391
00:23:56.558 --> 00:24:00.028
The couple who was in here before offered
to split the winnings with me.


392
00:24:00.187 --> 00:24:02.110
And of course I said no.

393
00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:05.735
Frankly, I'm surprised that you
would even suggest this, Tess.


394
00:24:07.653 --> 00:24:09.872
What if we went 60-40?

395
00:24:11.949 --> 00:24:13.121
- Seventy-thirty.
- Yeah.


396
00:24:13.617 --> 00:24:16.291
You are dangerously close to a rectal exam.

397
00:24:17.371 --> 00:24:18.918
Oh, that's not good.

398
00:24:19.081 --> 00:24:21.709
Mom, I wanna go to Times Square
to watch the ball drop.


399
00:24:21.875 --> 00:24:26.597
Well, I plan to avoid this entire
section of the city tonight.


400
00:24:26.755 --> 00:24:29.224
Well, I don't want you to stay. 
I want you to go home.

401
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.553
- Ouch.
- There's this guy in my history class.


402
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.939
His name is Seth, and I've been hoping--

403
00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:38.943
I have this, like, sick dream that, you know,
we'll get to hang out at midnight.


404
00:24:39.101 --> 00:24:41.069
And then, of course, 
I'll come right home.

405
00:24:41.937 --> 00:24:43.189
Honey, I'm sorry.

406
00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:48.452
I'm just-- I'm not comfortable allowing you
to stay in Times Square at night alone.


407
00:24:49.653 --> 00:24:51.747
- Period.
- End of discussion, got it.


408
00:24:51.905 --> 00:24:53.907
Sorry. Come on.

409
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.998
- You know, I'm 15!
- I know, Hailey.


410
00:24:57.161 --> 00:24:58.583
This is not a training bra!

411
00:24:58.746 --> 00:25:01.249
And this is not Girls Gone Wild!

412
00:25:01.415 --> 00:25:02.462
My gosh.

413
00:25:02.624 --> 00:25:04.592
Mom, you know, 
I'm an honors student, okay?

414
00:25:04.752 --> 00:25:08.757
I don't drink or do drugs, and I'm trying
really hard to be the perfect daughter.


415
00:25:08.922 --> 00:25:12.017
- But it's like you don't trust me.
- No, it's not you I don't trust.


416
00:25:12.176 --> 00:25:15.020
Then who do you not trust, Mom?
You don't trust the world?


417
00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:17.682
Or is it just New York
because it's a big scary city?

418
00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:19.270
Have you ever been to Newark?

419
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:24.689
Look, Mom, the world doesn't scare
me, okay? It's just getting good.


420
00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:26.778
I wanna start living in it.

421
00:25:27.191 --> 00:25:28.534
You used to.

422
00:25:32.613 --> 00:25:34.115
Brady Finley in Times Square.

423
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:38.206
It's before noon and they're already
predicting record-breaking crowds.


424
00:25:38.368 --> 00:25:41.838
I'm with Miss Morgan. We're bringing
the media to the roof.


425
00:25:43.957 --> 00:25:45.459
Hey. You okay?

426
00:25:46.543 --> 00:25:48.762
- Fine.
- You're not afraid of heights, are you?


427
00:25:49.505 --> 00:25:51.007
- A little.
- Let me be accurate.


428
00:25:51.173 --> 00:25:53.801
You're afraid of heights and
you run the ball drop?

429
00:25:54.593 --> 00:25:57.312
Well, I think it's what makes
Claire the best for this job.


430
00:25:57.805 --> 00:26:01.150
- Let's do that thing we worked out.
- Yeah, let's do that.


431
00:26:01.308 --> 00:26:02.901
- Officer Nolan.
- Yes, sir.


432
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.939
Be careful here. 
This is precious cargo, all right?

433
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.948
Make a hole, people.

434
00:26:11.276 --> 00:26:13.244
- Oh.
- Oh, are we all getting picked up?


435
00:26:13.403 --> 00:26:14.996
- Sure.
- No, no, no.


436
00:26:15.155 --> 00:26:17.078
No, no, no.

437
00:26:17.908 --> 00:26:19.626
Okay.

438
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.129
I'm okay. Ha-ha.

439
00:26:22.287 --> 00:26:24.130
Okay. Where were we?

440
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:25.632
Uh-
- Oh, the ball.

441
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.549
Since 1907 there's been
a Times Square ball drop.

442
00:26:29.711 --> 00:26:31.964
The first ball was
made of wood and iron...

443
00:26:32.131 --> 00:26:35.510
...and had only 10025-watt light bulbs.

444
00:26:36.885 --> 00:26:39.638
Okay. Let's light this baby up.

445
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:41.390
Ready?

446
00:26:42.182 --> 00:26:43.399
- on.
- Hey!


447
00:26:44.184 --> 00:26:45.902
- It worked!
- Beautiful.


448
00:26:46.728 --> 00:26:50.824
Okay, so this evening we are gonna raise
this ball to the very top of the pole...


449
00:26:50.983 --> 00:26:54.032
...where it will stay until 11:59.

450
00:26:54.194 --> 00:26:56.572
And then the countdown begins.

451
00:26:57.906 --> 00:27:00.910
- Can you fix it?
- No. And don't you want to know why?


452
00:27:01.076 --> 00:27:04.831
Because the complicated machine
behind me isn't called a fix truck.


453
00:27:04.997 --> 00:27:06.089
It's called a tow truck.

454
00:27:06.248 --> 00:27:10.003
That means I put the big hook under the broken
car and take it anywhere you want.


455
00:27:10.169 --> 00:27:11.967
- Which is where?
- New York City.


456
00:27:12.129 --> 00:27:13.506
No again.

457
00:27:13.672 --> 00:27:16.926
Not today and not me. I've got big
plans with my lady friend tonight.


458
00:27:17.092 --> 00:27:18.685
Sign there.

459
00:27:18.844 --> 00:27:21.438
Can you at least tow
it to a mechanic nearby, please?

460
00:27:21.597 --> 00:27:24.066
Nearest mechanic is 10 minutes away.

461
00:27:24.224 --> 00:27:26.522
- Whatever, that's perfect.
- Let me finish.


462
00:27:26.685 --> 00:27:30.189
He's 10 minutes away, but he's closed
today. Everyone's closed today.


463
00:27:30.355 --> 00:27:32.858
I guess you know since you're
dressed like Penn & Teller.


464
00:27:33.192 --> 00:27:35.411
As far as the car goes, you're SOL...

465
00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:38.413
...which means "something out
of luck," but I don't curse.


466
00:27:38.572 --> 00:27:42.622
I can't be SOL. I've got a big speech
at the company party tonight, okay?


467
00:27:42.784 --> 00:27:43.876
This is very important.

468
00:27:44.036 --> 00:27:46.255
- I've got something important too.
- Like what?


469
00:27:46.872 --> 00:27:49.876
Me and my girl are gonna crush
a 12-pack and watch porn.


470
00:27:59.051 --> 00:28:00.177
- Ms. Withers?
- Oh.


471
00:28:00.552 --> 00:28:02.646
Did you call in a delivery of something?

472
00:28:02.804 --> 00:28:04.977
- Ingrid.
- Ingrid.


473
00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.518
And actually...

474
00:28:08.602 --> 00:28:09.979
...I'm your next job.

475
00:28:10.395 --> 00:28:11.612
I bought you for the day.

476
00:28:11.772 --> 00:28:13.194
Bought me for the day, huh?

477
00:28:13.357 --> 00:28:17.237
Oh, Ms. Withers. I think I should be
offended, but I'm just too intrigued.


478
00:28:17.402 --> 00:28:18.824
My New Year's resolutions.

479
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:20.451
Mm-hm.

480
00:28:22.241 --> 00:28:24.289
I just took care of the first one.

481
00:28:24.785 --> 00:28:26.537
You quit your job?

482
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.880
- All right.
- If you make these come true by midnight...


483
00:28:35.045 --> 00:28:36.171
...you get these.

484
00:28:39.633 --> 00:28:40.680
For me?

485
00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:42.556
Holy sh--

486
00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:46.440
Whoa. Whoa, okay. Put these down.
Don't flash those around.


487
00:28:46.598 --> 00:28:48.566
Everybody can see them. Seriously.

488
00:28:49.017 --> 00:28:52.362
You called the right guy. I'm
in. Let me see number two.


489
00:28:52.521 --> 00:28:55.491
What is it? Whew.

490
00:28:56.275 --> 00:28:59.700
"Go to Bali. Breakfast at Tiffany's."

491
00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:01.158
You wanna save a life.

492
00:29:03.115 --> 00:29:04.162
Are you kidding me?

493
00:29:04.324 --> 00:29:07.123
Impossible. I don't understand
what you're talking about.


494
00:29:07.286 --> 00:29:09.960
I don't understand what you
want me to do here.

495
00:29:10.122 --> 00:29:12.375
Use your imagination.

496
00:29:17.587 --> 00:29:19.885
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

497
00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:25.228
You know, you don't
have to sit like that.

498
00:29:25.387 --> 00:29:28.357
You can put your legs around
me, or you can hold onto me.


499
00:29:28.515 --> 00:29:30.313
No, I'm okay.

500
00:29:30.809 --> 00:29:31.856
All right.

501
00:29:35.063 --> 00:29:36.235
Señor Jensen, I'm here.

502
00:29:36.982 --> 00:29:40.577
And I brought you some enchiladas.
They're very spicy.


503
00:29:40.736 --> 00:29:41.908
Thank you.

504
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.573
Listen, Ava, I was hoping maybe
you could help me out.


505
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.868
What is it? Is it writer's block?

506
00:29:47.034 --> 00:29:49.878
Because if it is, 
I've been jotting down these lyrics.

507
00:29:50.037 --> 00:29:52.665
They're in Spanish now,
but I can translate them.

508
00:29:52.831 --> 00:29:56.210
Come, come. Come here. No,
not like that. Really. Just--


509
00:29:57.336 --> 00:29:59.759
Help me convince Laura
that I made a mistake.

510
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:02.549
- When?
- It was last New Year's Eve.


511
00:30:02.716 --> 00:30:04.309
What did you do to her?

512
00:30:04.468 --> 00:30:06.266
Nothing. I asked her to marry me.

513
00:30:06.553 --> 00:30:07.645
That's beautiful.

514
00:30:07.804 --> 00:30:10.102
But then I got cold feet. 
I wasn't ready for it.

515
00:30:10.265 --> 00:30:11.858
That's horrible.

516
00:30:12.017 --> 00:30:14.065
You were the one who proposed.

517
00:30:14.227 --> 00:30:17.151
In my country when a
man gets down on one knee...

518
00:30:17.314 --> 00:30:20.238
...it's because he wants to get
married or he's been shot.


519
00:30:21.193 --> 00:30:23.412
Sometimes it's been because of both.

520
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.455
No, no. It's just that it all came at me
too fast and I wasn't ready for it.


521
00:30:28.617 --> 00:30:31.746
I had to go back on the road, and
I just didn't wanna deal with it.


522
00:30:31.912 --> 00:30:35.667
You should have talked to her. That's
what women like. We like to talk.


523
00:30:35.832 --> 00:30:39.132
I tried. I just can't get a word
in edgewise between slaps.


524
00:30:40.212 --> 00:30:42.135
Do you want to know what I think?

525
00:30:42.297 --> 00:30:43.469
Well, I sure would.

526
00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:48.346
Ay. Hi, Laura.

527
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.979
This is not what it looks like. No.

528
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:54.142
- No?
- No.


529
00:30:54.309 --> 00:30:58.940
It's not my ex-boyfriend telling our whole
sad saga to my new sous-chef?


530
00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:01.029
Yeah, pretty much that's what it is.

531
00:31:01.191 --> 00:31:03.114
Uh-huh.

532
00:31:03.819 --> 00:31:05.321
- Be strong.
- Mm.


533
00:31:05.487 --> 00:31:07.865
- Hold your ground.
- Yes.


534
00:31:08.031 --> 00:31:12.502
But don't look into his eyes because they're
beautiful. He has, like, a blue...


535
00:31:13.412 --> 00:31:14.755
Bye.

536
00:31:17.457 --> 00:31:18.583
Truce?

537
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:21.757
Truce.

538
00:31:26.842 --> 00:31:28.310
Breakfast at Tiffany's.

539
00:31:28.927 --> 00:31:30.099
Done.

540
00:31:30.262 --> 00:31:32.264
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


541
00:31:34.766 --> 00:31:37.360
Take a New York
taxi ride with no traffic.

542
00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:38.862
Done.

543
00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:41.231
Did you hear the new record?

544
00:31:41.398 --> 00:31:42.991
No.

545
00:31:46.528 --> 00:31:47.905
Yeah.

546
00:31:48.363 --> 00:31:49.706
What'd you think?

547
00:31:49.865 --> 00:31:53.244
Ugh. You know, I wanted to hate
it. I really did. But I loved it.


548
00:31:53.743 --> 00:31:55.165
I thought it was great.

549
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.793
Except for the picture
you chose for the cover.

550
00:32:00.459 --> 00:32:02.132
It was a little too much bronzer.

551
00:32:02.294 --> 00:32:04.797
Well, as always, 
I could've used your help.

552
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.435
I'm a little overwhelmed and
frazzled by this job tonight...


553
00:32:10.594 --> 00:32:12.471
...so I apologize for slapping you.

554
00:32:12.637 --> 00:32:13.763
The second time.

555
00:32:17.267 --> 00:32:19.440
I'm sorry I ran, Laura.

556
00:32:20.645 --> 00:32:22.363
Oh, Daniel.

557
00:32:22.731 --> 00:32:24.574
You sprinted.

558
00:32:25.233 --> 00:32:26.280
I mean--

559
00:32:27.652 --> 00:32:28.744
Laura, can I see you?

560
00:32:28.904 --> 00:32:31.157
I gotta get back
to work, focus on tonight.

561
00:32:31.323 --> 00:32:32.745
What about tomorrow?

562
00:32:32.908 --> 00:32:35.832
We're going back on tour and I'd
love it if you'd come with me.


563
00:32:36.578 --> 00:32:38.751
We could fix this.

564
00:32:38.914 --> 00:32:41.713
Yeah, sure. I'll go pack a bag. 
Meet you at the bus?

565
00:32:43.084 --> 00:32:44.210
Come on.

566
00:32:44.377 --> 00:32:48.052
I can't go back on tour with you.
I did your life. I have a life too.


567
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:50.600
You really don't get it, do you?

568
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.762
What's there to get?

569
00:32:54.095 --> 00:32:55.768
I'm ready to commit.

570
00:32:56.806 --> 00:32:58.524
I'm ready.

571
00:32:58.683 --> 00:33:01.061
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

572
00:33:01.228 --> 00:33:03.606
I'm ready to commit
to what I really love:

573
00:33:03.772 --> 00:33:05.240
My work.

574
00:33:05.857 --> 00:33:08.326
I can't do this again with you, Daniel.

575
00:33:17.118 --> 00:33:19.041
Nope. Still no reception.

576
00:33:19.704 --> 00:33:21.297
So how can you have nowhere to be?

577
00:33:21.456 --> 00:33:25.677
Isn't it obvious? New Year's is the worst
night to go out. It's total amateur night.


578
00:33:25.835 --> 00:33:29.965
People who don't drink or go nuts all year
suddenly going all Kanye on you.


579
00:33:30.131 --> 00:33:31.474
It's like a war zone.

580
00:33:31.633 --> 00:33:34.102
Because they have something to be excited about.

581
00:33:34.261 --> 00:33:36.434
I have something to be excited about.

582
00:33:36.596 --> 00:33:38.974
Oh, oh, oh.

583
00:33:39.307 --> 00:33:41.355
Who were you gonna kiss at midnight?

584
00:33:42.227 --> 00:33:45.857
Oh. And then it's one big giant letdown.

585
00:33:46.022 --> 00:33:47.990
See, that's the problem with New Year's.

586
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:52.700
Everybody builds up such high expectation that
they're inevitably, utterly disappointed.


587
00:33:52.862 --> 00:33:55.911
Hey, can you get through that ceiling hatch?

588
00:33:56.825 --> 00:33:58.498
I am not Spider
-Man.

589
00:33:59.411 --> 00:34:00.958
Clearly. Clearly.

590
00:34:01.204 --> 00:34:04.083
If I just climb right
through there, get out that window.

591
00:34:04.249 --> 00:34:06.672
And we're gonna be out of here. 
I am gonna do it.

592
00:34:07.377 --> 00:34:09.596
Lift me up. Lift me up. 
I don't have all day.

593
00:34:09.963 --> 00:34:11.431
- There you go.
- Oh.


594
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.807
It's a lock.

595
00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:16.766
Oh, I have a nail file. 
I'll file it with my nail file.

596
00:34:16.928 --> 00:34:18.396
I'll file through it.

597
00:34:18.597 --> 00:34:20.850
Ugh. You're a groupie?

598
00:34:25.979 --> 00:34:27.196
Put me down.

599
00:34:28.481 --> 00:34:31.576
I got hats and horns and hazarai. 
I got streamers--

600
00:34:31.735 --> 00:34:33.863
- Hey, Marvin. Hi. Happy New Year.
- Hey, Kim.


601
00:34:34.029 --> 00:34:36.657
- Mom, can I go tell my friends?
- Sure, yeah.


602
00:34:36.823 --> 00:34:37.870
Go ahead.

603
00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:40.035
So Hailey and I
are having a party tonight.

604
00:34:40.201 --> 00:34:41.578
Hey, wait up.

605
00:34:41.745 --> 00:34:44.498
- Hey. Um...
- Hey.


606
00:34:44.664 --> 00:34:46.041
I can't come.

607
00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:49.553
What? Hailey, what do you mean?
Half the history class is going.


608
00:34:49.711 --> 00:34:52.134
- I know. It's just my mom won't let me.
- You serious?


609
00:34:52.297 --> 00:34:54.595
I know. I sound
like I'm 12, I know.

610
00:34:54.758 --> 00:34:57.477
All right, where's your mom? Maybe I--

611
00:34:57.636 --> 00:34:59.684
- Hi. Hi, Mrs. Doyle.
- Hi.


612
00:34:59.846 --> 00:35:01.189
You look lovely today.

613
00:35:01.348 --> 00:35:04.397
You seem like a nice boy. I'm just
not comfortable with Hailey...


614
00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:07.813
...spending tonight in Times Square unsupervised.

615
00:35:07.979 --> 00:35:10.528
Right. With all due respect...

616
00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.569
...supervision is for kids, you
know? We're young adults.


617
00:35:16.029 --> 00:35:17.076
Who are you calling?

618
00:35:17.238 --> 00:35:19.206
- You're Rose Anderson's son, right?
- Yeah.


619
00:35:19.366 --> 00:35:22.290
Yeah, we serve together on your
school's academic booster club.


620
00:35:22.702 --> 00:35:27.378
Oh. You know, I think she left her cell phone
at home. She gonna go out tonight.


621
00:35:27.666 --> 00:35:29.259
- Oh.
- Yeah.


622
00:35:29.834 --> 00:35:30.881
Okay.

623
00:35:31.044 --> 00:35:32.216
Happy New Year.

624
00:35:32.379 --> 00:35:33.881
Yeah. Happy New Year.

625
00:35:34.255 --> 00:35:36.132
You wanna say goodbye?

626
00:35:36.758 --> 00:35:38.135
So?

627
00:35:38.301 --> 00:35:40.269
Hailey, I tried. 
But she fights dirty.

628
00:35:41.346 --> 00:35:43.940
Yeah, I know. Welcome to my life.

629
00:35:44.224 --> 00:35:45.817
- Bye.
- Bye.


630
00:35:49.521 --> 00:35:53.025
Ladies, let's go. Yo. 
Ladies, let's roll out!

631
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:54.443
- Yeah!
- Whoo!


632
00:36:13.169 --> 00:36:17.094
What is this neighborhood? Is it safe?

633
00:36:17.257 --> 00:36:18.850
Give it a chance.

634
00:36:19.008 --> 00:36:22.387
"Give Paul a chance."

635
00:36:24.097 --> 00:36:25.394
I don't like it here.

636
00:36:26.224 --> 00:36:28.977
Maybe this is a really bad idea.
I'll just give you the tickets.


637
00:36:29.144 --> 00:36:31.397
Give Paul a chance

638
00:36:31.563 --> 00:36:34.066
Just give me a
chance and I'll show you

639
00:36:34.274 --> 00:36:35.821
What I can do.

640
00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:38.278
Ingrid Withers...

641
00:36:40.405 --> 00:36:41.748
...go to Bali.

642
00:36:58.465 --> 00:37:00.263
It's Bali.

643
00:37:00.759 --> 00:37:02.056
It's Brooklyn.

644
00:37:02.635 --> 00:37:03.807
It's a spa.

645
00:37:24.449 --> 00:37:26.042
Thank you.

646
00:37:27.744 --> 00:37:30.088
I'm sorry. We really can't
take you this early yet.

647
00:37:30.246 --> 00:37:34.001
Dr. Morriset says that you're not ready.
You'll have to come back in a few hours.


648
00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:36.966
We may not have been ready, but
now she's eating anchovies...


649
00:37:37.128 --> 00:37:39.130
...which the Internet claims induce labor.

650
00:37:39.297 --> 00:37:40.799
If only you can keep it down.

651
00:37:40.965 --> 00:37:43.969
Yeah, but it really doesn't go that fast.

652
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.274
- No. I can't do it. I can't do it.
- Excuse me.


653
00:37:50.725 --> 00:37:52.193
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:52.352 --> 00:37:53.979
I tried. I can't do it anymore.

655
00:37:54.145 --> 00:37:55.772
You need a breath mint.

656
00:37:56.272 --> 00:37:58.400
Hey, Risa. So we are
ready to check in now.

657
00:37:58.566 --> 00:37:59.818
They're checking in?

658
00:38:04.656 --> 00:38:06.909
Hey. Good to see you again.

659
00:38:07.075 --> 00:38:10.670
You must be joking, because inside
I'm laughing really, really hard.


660
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:15.217
You really think you can come into this at
the last minute and steal our money?


661
00:38:15.792 --> 00:38:17.044
I'm sorry, are you being serious?

662
00:38:18.628 --> 00:38:20.722
You are even a
bigger numbnuts than you look.

663
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.882
This little fish won't save you.

664
00:38:23.508 --> 00:38:26.682
You probably don't even know that
yams can kick-start labor.


665
00:38:26.845 --> 00:38:28.267
Well, yeah, actually, we do.

666
00:38:28.429 --> 00:38:31.399
In fact, at this moment, my wife
is full of yams, but thank you.


667
00:38:31.558 --> 00:38:32.980
Crammed with yams.

668
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:35.357
Snap. It doesn't.

669
00:38:35.603 --> 00:38:37.150
It stops pre-term labor.

670
00:38:37.939 --> 00:38:40.408
- Did he just snap me in a maternity ward?
- Yes.


671
00:38:40.608 --> 00:38:42.076
You're a really hostile guy.

672
00:38:42.402 --> 00:38:44.120
Where do you work, the DMV?

673
00:38:44.279 --> 00:38:45.872
No, I run a charm school.

674
00:38:46.281 --> 00:38:48.750
Oh, yeah? Where's your charm school Guantanamo?

675
00:38:49.742 --> 00:38:51.915
It's on 48th and
Madison, you should come by.

676
00:38:52.078 --> 00:38:54.422
Because you could really use some charm.

677
00:38:55.498 --> 00:38:57.626
- He actually works at a charm school.
- No way.


678
00:38:59.335 --> 00:39:01.303
Ah. Prince of Charming.

679
00:39:06.009 --> 00:39:07.932
Hello, vision in pink.

680
00:39:08.303 --> 00:39:09.555
Can we check in now?

681
00:39:09.721 --> 00:39:12.144
Well, actually, the ultrasound says it's a no.

682
00:39:12.307 --> 00:39:15.186
She's not ready either, so you'll
all have to come back later.


683
00:39:15.351 --> 00:39:16.853
I'm sorry, James.

684
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.988
It's not your fault.

685
00:39:21.107 --> 00:39:23.326
- I'm sorry too.
- Right.


686
00:39:23.484 --> 00:39:26.658
- Also, it's on now, Prince Charming. Yeah.
- You bet.


687
00:39:28.281 --> 00:39:30.033
What are you doing, honey?

688
00:39:30.617 --> 00:39:33.166
Oh, it's on.

689
00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:35.588
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, no.


690
00:39:35.747 --> 00:39:36.794
What's on?

691
00:39:37.332 --> 00:39:39.005
Oh, yeah, this?

692
00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:42.045
- It's on.
- Come on. Let's go, honey.


693
00:39:42.211 --> 00:39:45.886
Nobody wins when pregnant women
fight. Come on. Come on.


694
00:39:48.009 --> 00:39:49.511
Something's on. Heh-heh.

695
00:39:53.014 --> 00:39:56.018
I know you gave up your own plans
tonight just to be with me


696
00:39:56.184 --> 00:40:00.030
I can't become your everything, Mom.
Please don't become a Piper's mom.


697
00:40:00.188 --> 00:40:03.738
A what? "A Piper's mom"?

698
00:40:04.359 --> 00:40:06.782
What, you mean like Joanna?

699
00:40:07.195 --> 00:40:09.698
Yes, Piper's mom. 
She hides in the bushes every day...

700
00:40:09.864 --> 00:40:12.708
...just to make sure that Piper
goes to school. It's nuts.


701
00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:15.666
- Come on. I'm not that bad.
- Mom, you've stopped trying.


702
00:40:15.828 --> 00:40:19.207
You're being clingy and mean, because
you don't have a man in your life.


703
00:40:19.374 --> 00:40:21.047
You really gotta find somebody.

704
00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:23.883
Look, Mom, you're a hot woman.

705
00:40:24.295 --> 00:40:27.890
If you'd just, you
know, lose the clogs, maybe?

706
00:40:30.093 --> 00:40:34.815
I'm sorry, but I am trying. 
And I would like you to try.

707
00:40:34.973 --> 00:40:36.896
Just have our New Year's party.

708
00:40:37.058 --> 00:40:40.153
- And toot-toot, Happy New Year!
- Okay. Mom! Mom! No more.


709
00:40:41.187 --> 00:40:42.234
I'm over it.

710
00:40:43.189 --> 00:40:45.658
I'm over it and I'm over you.

711
00:40:49.904 --> 00:40:53.750
Why are we at the church? You were supposed
to take me to the rental car shop!


712
00:40:53.908 --> 00:40:55.910
Hey, James Bond, 
I need one more signature.

713
00:40:56.077 --> 00:40:57.920
For what?! What am I even signing for?

714
00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:00.582
So you can get your
car back. Right there. Initials.

715
00:41:00.748 --> 00:41:02.750
Keep the pen, it's
got my name on it.

716
00:41:02.917 --> 00:41:05.841
Didn't I tell you that all
the rental places close at 3?

717
00:41:06.004 --> 00:41:09.224
I've got you covered. There's your
ride right there. Hey, Edwin.


718
00:41:09.382 --> 00:41:11.055
Hey, Harley. Hey, Sam.

719
00:41:11.217 --> 00:41:12.935
Hey, he's the pastor.

720
00:41:13.094 --> 00:41:14.596
Yeah, that's right. 
It's the earmuffs.

721
00:41:16.097 --> 00:41:18.191
- So my cousin here tells me you need a lift.
- Cousin?


722
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:22.729
I'm taking my wife and kids to see the Radio
City Rockettes. We do it every New Year's.


723
00:41:22.895 --> 00:41:24.522
Ever seen the Rockettes? Tch-tch.

724
00:41:24.689 --> 00:41:27.283
Happy to give you a lift. 
You want to pitch in for gas?

725
00:41:27.442 --> 00:41:30.787
- Hell, yeah. I'll pay for all the gas.
- Don't say "hell," he's a pastor.


726
00:41:30.945 --> 00:41:32.367
Show him the book.

727
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.328
Give me my pen back.

728
00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:36.872
I'll never understand people with hair.

729
00:41:37.285 --> 00:41:38.707
Thank you, Harley.

730
00:41:40.663 --> 00:41:42.381
There she is.

731
00:41:43.332 --> 00:41:45.005
How much gas are we talking about?

732
00:41:45.168 --> 00:41:47.091
What's your credit-card limit?

733
00:41:48.796 --> 00:41:50.343
ICU, how can I help you?

734
00:41:50.757 --> 00:41:52.600
Hi, Mr. Harris.

735
00:41:53.509 --> 00:41:55.182
How you doing today?

736
00:41:56.345 --> 00:41:57.392
Right.

737
00:41:57.555 --> 00:42:02.277
You've been here for weeks. First no
radiation, now no chemo. Why?


738
00:42:02.477 --> 00:42:06.072
What's the difference, you know? Why
delay the inevitable? I don't know.


739
00:42:07.106 --> 00:42:11.907
When I was a photographer in Vietnam,
I'd see death all the time.


740
00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:14.698
Nothing prepared me for this.

741
00:42:15.698 --> 00:42:18.497
I promise I'm gonna make you
as comfortable as I can, okay?


742
00:42:19.118 --> 00:42:21.416
Just get me to midnight and we're even.

743
00:42:21.579 --> 00:42:22.626
Okay.

744
00:42:24.582 --> 00:42:26.300
I'll be back.

745
00:42:33.758 --> 00:42:36.432
Honey? I've been thinking.

746
00:42:36.594 --> 00:42:38.346
Hailey?

747
00:42:47.522 --> 00:42:49.775
I fought so hard for custody.

748
00:42:50.024 --> 00:42:52.903
Hey, I got hats here! What do
you need? Yo! Scarves, hats!


749
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:55.197
Happy New Year! 
Here, pick a hat. Go ahead.

750
00:42:55.363 --> 00:42:57.331
Keep walking, then. Go ahead.

751
00:43:00.243 --> 00:43:02.291
- Marvin!
- Kim!


752
00:43:02.453 --> 00:43:04.000
- Hailey!
- UP.


753
00:43:04.163 --> 00:43:05.665
Oh, thanks.

754
00:43:07.416 --> 00:43:09.384
Hey, yo. Happy New Year!

755
00:43:09.544 --> 00:43:10.887
Poppers, streamers, horns!

756
00:43:31.065 --> 00:43:32.567
Hailey!

757
00:43:40.449 --> 00:43:41.826
Calling you.

758
00:43:48.499 --> 00:43:49.796
Hey, it's Hailey.

759
00:43:49.959 --> 00:43:52.087
Leave me a message and I'll
try and get back to you.

760
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:06.317
I think she decided.

761
00:44:06.475 --> 00:44:08.728
- You got a hat.
- You got a dog.


762
00:44:08.895 --> 00:44:10.317
Oh, it's a big responsibility.

763
00:44:10.479 --> 00:44:13.574
Yeah, but you gotta give it a chance.
Give it a chance, right?


764
00:44:13.733 --> 00:44:16.282
We'll give him his shots. 
You can pick him up Monday.

765
00:44:16.444 --> 00:44:18.117
Or you can wait and think about it.

766
00:44:20.114 --> 00:44:21.457
No.

767
00:44:21.908 --> 00:44:23.706
- I'm done waiting.
- Yeah!


768
00:44:23.868 --> 00:44:27.372
We're gonna make each
other very happy. Aren't we?

769
00:44:27.538 --> 00:44:29.131
What are we gonna name him?

770
00:44:29.624 --> 00:44:32.503
- Um...
- Something manly like Kong.


771
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.806
How about Mr. Snugglepuss?

772
00:44:36.964 --> 00:44:39.092
"Snugglepuss"? 
You can decide on a name later.

773
00:44:39.258 --> 00:44:42.228
Anyways, look what you just did.

774
00:44:42.386 --> 00:44:45.265
Saved a life. Check.

775
00:44:46.432 --> 00:44:48.184
Take a trip around the world.

776
00:44:48.351 --> 00:44:51.070
It's a bit of a cheat. But check.

777
00:45:06.202 --> 00:45:08.330
It's 6:00 here in Times Square.

778
00:45:08.788 --> 00:45:13.168
And now to host tonight's festivities,
Mr. New Year's Eve himself:


779
00:45:13.334 --> 00:45:14.551
Ryan Seacrest!

780
00:45:22.218 --> 00:45:23.310
Thank you very much.

781
00:45:23.594 --> 00:45:25.062
Hello, New York City!

782
00:45:25.554 --> 00:45:26.851
I'm Ryan Seacrest.

783
00:45:27.014 --> 00:45:30.939
Are you ready to see the Times
Square ball being raised?


784
00:45:31.102 --> 00:45:34.276
We've been joined by several members
of the Times Square Alliance...


785
00:45:34.438 --> 00:45:36.315
...as they get ready for the ball drop.

786
00:45:36.482 --> 00:45:39.452
I know you're nervous, but you
have to look up, Jeffrey.


787
00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.328
Here we go!

788
00:46:01.674 --> 00:46:03.051
Uh-oh.

789
00:46:06.721 --> 00:46:08.974
That's not supposed to happen.

790
00:46:12.226 --> 00:46:14.729
Sorry, friends, we have a
bit of a hiccup here.

791
00:46:14.895 --> 00:46:17.865
We'll just sort that out, no problem.

792
00:46:18.024 --> 00:46:20.322
Stay with us, we'll be right back, okay?

793
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.613
We will have it
up and running momentarily, right?

794
00:46:23.779 --> 00:46:25.122
Yeah. it's-
- There's--

795
00:46:25.281 --> 00:46:26.533
- Please? Please.
- Yes.


796
00:46:26.699 --> 00:46:30.203
I'm starting to feel a little bit of pressure.
Pressure's not great to feel.


797
00:46:30.369 --> 00:46:33.873
And it messes with my hair. And I need
my hair to be up. Like the ball.


798
00:46:37.877 --> 00:46:41.757
Go, guys, go. We gotta fix this
by midnight. Go, go, go.


799
00:46:42.298 --> 00:46:44.892
Whew. This would never
have happened to Dick Clark.

800
00:46:48.804 --> 00:46:51.603
- Can't you show me one special trick?
- I'm not a magician.


801
00:46:52.099 --> 00:46:54.602
- Okay?
- Are you in the Secret Service, mister?


802
00:46:54.769 --> 00:46:55.861
Duncan.

803
00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.148
So, what's the speech about, Sam?

804
00:46:58.314 --> 00:47:00.908
Like I said, I
haven't even written it yet.

805
00:47:01.067 --> 00:47:04.116
I guess I'm still looking for the inspiration.

806
00:47:05.946 --> 00:47:08.119
What inspires you, Sam?

807
00:47:09.325 --> 00:47:11.794
- Pizza.
- Excellent.


808
00:47:12.453 --> 00:47:13.625
Sweet.

809
00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:15.293
Okay, thanks.

810
00:47:17.958 --> 00:47:19.835
Welcome to the Queens Museum...

811
00:47:20.002 --> 00:47:23.472
...featuring the New York City miniatures
depicting all five boroughs.


812
00:47:23.798 --> 00:47:26.267
And now, the very best part:

813
00:47:26.425 --> 00:47:29.474
Walk all five boroughs in one day.

814
00:47:31.222 --> 00:47:32.895
Crossing that off the list.

815
00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:40.523
Yo, Randy, I know you said you didn't
wanna come out tonight, but listen.


816
00:47:40.689 --> 00:47:44.319
I made a deal with this lady for four
tickets to Ahern's VIP party.


817
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.113
I don't know what her
deal is, man. She's just...

818
00:47:47.279 --> 00:47:49.953
...like, a couple sandwiches
short of a picnic. You know?


819
00:47:50.116 --> 00:47:53.837
Like a little bit pathetic. 
In, like, a cute way.

820
00:47:53.994 --> 00:47:56.088
So, dude, please, please call me back, bro.

821
00:47:56.247 --> 00:47:59.717
I need you. I need my wingman
at this party. Hit me back, bro.


822
00:48:00.584 --> 00:48:02.837
Okay. All right, next up...

823
00:48:03.504 --> 00:48:05.552
...is to be amazed.

824
00:48:06.215 --> 00:48:07.762
Which is very vague.

825
00:48:07.925 --> 00:48:11.725
I will be amazed if I can come
up with something. But I will.


826
00:48:12.263 --> 00:48:14.140
I don't wanna do this anymore.

827
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:16.267
What are you talking about?

828
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.733
I'm pathetic...

829
00:48:20.229 --> 00:48:21.697
...dude.

830
00:48:24.442 --> 00:48:25.910
Hey.

831
00:48:28.654 --> 00:48:30.907
Wait, where are you going?

832
00:48:31.073 --> 00:48:32.791
Staten Island.

833
00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:39.541
- Miss Morgan, we're not sure what's wrong.
- How long will it take to be sure?


834
00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.089
I don't know. A couple minutes,
a couple hours, maybe more.


835
00:48:43.252 --> 00:48:46.301
We don't have a couple of hours.
We only have midnight.


836
00:48:46.464 --> 00:48:48.933
I have one job tonight. 
To make sure...

837
00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:53.096
...even if I have to do it with my own two
hands, that ball descends at midnight.


838
00:48:53.262 --> 00:48:54.684
You can't move midnight.

839
00:48:55.973 --> 00:48:59.477
Why are you looking at your shoes?
You're not telling me something.


840
00:48:59.643 --> 00:49:01.566
What are you not telling me?

841
00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:07.071
We need Kominsky.

842
00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.408
The Kominsky?

843
00:49:13.324 --> 00:49:14.667
Tess?

844
00:49:15.284 --> 00:49:17.503
Tess? You in the bathroom?

845
00:49:20.915 --> 00:49:22.007
What are you doing?

846
00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:24.043
Yoga. It's supposed to help.

847
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.464
I'm no expert, but seems like that would
send the baby in the wrong direction.


848
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.842
Let me help you.

849
00:49:31.008 --> 00:49:32.806
Oh...

850
00:49:32.968 --> 00:49:34.094
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.


851
00:49:34.261 --> 00:49:36.263
And I got a discount
with my vet school ID.

852
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.649
You'll make such a good veterinarian someday.

853
00:49:38.807 --> 00:49:41.560
Thanks. And if you were a horse, 
I'd know what to do.

854
00:49:41.727 --> 00:49:45.402
Of course, if you were a horse, we'd
never get invited to dinner parties...


855
00:49:45.564 --> 00:49:47.817
- ...and I'd be married to a horse.
- Ha-ha-ha.


856
00:49:47.983 --> 00:49:49.735
This smells awful.

857
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:52.408
- Drink it.
- Mm-mm.


858
00:49:52.571 --> 00:49:53.743
What? It's castor oil.

859
00:49:53.948 --> 00:49:55.370
Mary Poppins swore by this.

860
00:49:55.533 --> 00:49:58.082
Mary Poppins also danced with cartoon penguins.

861
00:49:58.244 --> 00:49:59.587
You first.

862
00:49:59.787 --> 00:50:01.289
You're a coward.

863
00:50:04.124 --> 00:50:06.718
- Mm. Mm.
- Hmm. I'm sensing a thumbs down.


864
00:50:06.877 --> 00:50:08.754
Ugh. Mary Poppins sucks.

865
00:50:08.963 --> 00:50:11.557
Well, you forgot about
the spoonful of sugar. Ooh.

866
00:50:11.715 --> 00:50:13.683
- What was that?
- What was what?


867
00:50:13.842 --> 00:50:15.560
Oh, my gosh. My water broke.

868
00:50:16.387 --> 00:50:17.889
- All of it?
- on.


869
00:50:18.264 --> 00:50:19.356
Well, what do you think?

870
00:50:19.515 --> 00:50:21.688
Well, that's too early. 
Can you turn it off?

871
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:23.852
- And how do you suggest I do that?
- Yoga?


872
00:50:24.019 --> 00:50:27.899
Get upside down. You can do a downward dog
or an upward dog. Do one of the dogs.


873
00:50:28.065 --> 00:50:30.409
- Okay, we need to pack!
- We have packed.


874
00:50:30.568 --> 00:50:32.115
- Okay, calm.
- Taxi!


875
00:50:32.278 --> 00:50:36.408
- I don't think we're gonna get one up here.
- Right, we gotta go where the cars live.


876
00:50:36.574 --> 00:50:38.747
- Pants, I need pants.
- Okay.


877
00:50:40.828 --> 00:50:42.125
These are your pants.

878
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.832
Give me the cute pink ones.

879
00:50:45.165 --> 00:50:46.712
Don't throw them at me.

880
00:50:48.794 --> 00:50:50.421
Okay, so I'll meet you there?

881
00:50:52.506 --> 00:50:53.803
You should come with me.

882
00:50:53.966 --> 00:50:56.139
- We should both go.
- Oh...


883
00:50:56.302 --> 00:50:58.396
Lady with a baby coming through.

884
00:50:58.554 --> 00:51:01.398
Taxi! Pregnant! Taxi!

885
00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:05.729
Okay. Want me to help?

886
00:51:05.894 --> 00:51:09.865
Honey, I spent my whole
life living in New York City.

887
00:51:10.024 --> 00:51:12.026
I think I know
how to get a taxicab.

888
00:51:12.192 --> 00:51:14.695
- Yeah.
- No! No!


889
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.074
Hah. Good job, homeboy.

890
00:51:18.532 --> 00:51:20.409
All right. Plan B. Hold this.

891
00:51:20.576 --> 00:51:22.328
- Oh!

892
00:51:25.914 --> 00:51:27.757
Be here now.

893
00:51:27.916 --> 00:51:29.168
Taxi!

894
00:51:29.877 --> 00:51:31.254
You're doing great, honey.

895
00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.842
- You're doing great.
- Oh!


896
00:51:35.341 --> 00:51:37.059
Can't we pedal faster?

897
00:51:37.635 --> 00:51:40.684
- Hey, buddy, can you go a little faster?
- This is my faster.


898
00:51:42.806 --> 00:51:44.604
Haven't you been here all day?

899
00:51:45.768 --> 00:51:48.738
- When do you go home?
- Just before midnight.


900
00:51:48.896 --> 00:51:50.022
Ah.

901
00:51:50.189 --> 00:51:54.615
You know what, I don't care about
all that hoopla and stuff anyway.


902
00:51:54.777 --> 00:51:57.530
So no big plans? 
A party or...?

903
00:51:57.696 --> 00:51:58.822
Nope.

904
00:51:58.989 --> 00:52:01.833
No hot date? Pretty girl like you.

905
00:52:01.992 --> 00:52:03.209
Well...

906
00:52:03.786 --> 00:52:05.083
...maybe.

907
00:52:05.579 --> 00:52:07.877
But right now you're my hot date.

908
00:52:08.874 --> 00:52:11.172
- Why?
- Pardon me?


909
00:52:11.377 --> 00:52:14.130
Why would you wanna be nice to me?

910
00:52:16.006 --> 00:52:17.474
I'm an ass.

911
00:52:17.883 --> 00:52:20.762
I spent my entire
whole life being an ass.

912
00:52:20.928 --> 00:52:24.853
And I don't know how to stop.

913
00:52:25.724 --> 00:52:27.567
Well, you know what, Stan?

914
00:52:27.726 --> 00:52:32.527
Maybe being an ass is the reason you've gotten
every single thing you ever wanted.


915
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.612
Not everything.

916
00:52:38.153 --> 00:52:40.406
I'm sorry I called you a groupie.

917
00:52:40.614 --> 00:52:44.118
We're stuck in an elevator together.
You're not gonna talk to me at all?


918
00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:47.789
Fine. We can talk.

919
00:52:48.122 --> 00:52:51.797
But as long as we're making assumptions
about each other...


920
00:52:51.959 --> 00:52:53.427
...why don't I give it a shot?

921
00:52:55.546 --> 00:52:58.550
You grew up in suburban fill-in-the-blank.

922
00:52:58.716 --> 00:53:00.935
You went to la-di-da liberal-arts school.

923
00:53:01.135 --> 00:53:03.513
You didn't have enough drive
to get a real job...

924
00:53:03.679 --> 00:53:05.556
...and then you grew half a beard...

925
00:53:05.723 --> 00:53:09.603
...and moved to Manhattan on your
grandmother's inheritance.


926
00:53:09.768 --> 00:53:14.023
And now you think that just because you moved
somewhere that makes you cool...


927
00:53:14.189 --> 00:53:16.487
...but the truth is,
is that it doesn't. Okay?

928
00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:20.200
Because you're just some wannabe
hipster who judges everything...


929
00:53:20.362 --> 00:53:23.036
...because you're too scared to
take a chance on anything.


930
00:53:23.198 --> 00:53:27.829
And, you know, my guess is that this
whole hatred for New Year's...


931
00:53:27.995 --> 00:53:30.339
...comes from some boring-as-hell prom queen...

932
00:53:30.497 --> 00:53:35.424
...who broke your heart on New Year's Eve
in high school. So, what, am I close?


933
00:53:37.421 --> 00:53:39.264
Suburban Maryland.

934
00:53:39.423 --> 00:53:41.175
Tufts University.

935
00:53:41.884 --> 00:53:43.761
And I am a comic-book artist.

936
00:53:44.928 --> 00:53:46.180
You draw?

937
00:53:46.513 --> 00:53:47.514
I illustrate.

938
00:53:49.475 --> 00:53:50.943
And it was in college...

939
00:53:51.477 --> 00:53:52.854
...when she broke it.

940
00:53:54.521 --> 00:53:56.819
And this beard took me
like a year to grow.

941
00:53:58.317 --> 00:53:59.569
Cold coffee?

942
00:54:02.988 --> 00:54:05.741
Last year there were so many speeches,
I had to get outside.


943
00:54:05.908 --> 00:54:07.876
So I actually went out
and got a pizza. Heh.

944
00:54:08.368 --> 00:54:09.870
Did anything else happen?

945
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:14.049
Oh, my. Something else did happen, didn't it?

946
00:54:15.918 --> 00:54:17.591
- Yes.
- Is it R-rated?


947
00:54:18.712 --> 00:54:20.055
Dad.

948
00:54:20.714 --> 00:54:22.682
- I met a woman...
- Oh.


949
00:54:23.008 --> 00:54:25.932
...and she was extraordinary.

950
00:54:26.094 --> 00:54:28.563
It's gonna have a goosebump ending.

951
00:54:28.722 --> 00:54:31.566
Take your time telling it, because
here comes the traffic.


952
00:54:33.727 --> 00:54:35.650
Extraordinary build, huh?

953
00:54:36.522 --> 00:54:38.320
I have to get to this party.

954
00:54:40.275 --> 00:54:44.701
Welcome to the Brooklyn Museum and the
Ahern party. Please pull right up, sir.


955
00:54:45.864 --> 00:54:48.413
Put on 'em ball When
they sleep at the Macy's

956
00:54:48.742 --> 00:54:52.212
Penny. Penny. Just quick one picture. 
Right over here!

957
00:54:52.371 --> 00:54:55.250
Tied over money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby

958
00:54:55.415 --> 00:54:56.883
I can make you feel right, baby

959
00:54:57.042 --> 00:54:58.715
- Excuse me
- Excuse me


960
00:54:58.877 --> 00:55:02.427
But I might drink a little
bit More than I should tonight

961
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:05.593
And I might take you
home with me If! could tonight

962
00:55:05.759 --> 00:55:07.352
You're an actress, right?

963
00:55:07.636 --> 00:55:11.732
Yeah. I've played a
nurse, a cop, a teacher.

964
00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:14.268
How about playing a waitress
and getting me a drink?

965
00:55:14.434 --> 00:55:15.981
Go ahead. Scoot, scoot.

966
00:55:16.144 --> 00:55:17.361
And now, your hostess...

967
00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:19.523
...the president of Ahern Records, Mrs. Rose Ahern.

968
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:24.116
Welcome to the Ahern Records Masked Ball.

969
00:55:24.278 --> 00:55:28.328
What better way to end
this year, both good and bad...

970
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.242
...than with the very, very best...

971
00:55:30.409 --> 00:55:33.879
...and you all know
exactly who I'm talking about.

972
00:55:34.371 --> 00:55:39.423
So I'll simply say that coming
up on this stage very soon...


973
00:55:39.585 --> 00:55:44.307
...one of the hottest names
- Jensen!


974
00:55:49.344 --> 00:55:51.438
I went to Juilliard...

975
00:55:51.597 --> 00:55:53.941
...and I am a backup singer.

976
00:55:54.099 --> 00:55:57.444
Not a back-of-the-tour-bus groupie.

977
00:55:58.061 --> 00:56:02.487
- Randy, a.k.a. Mr. Moron.
- Heh.


978
00:56:03.025 --> 00:56:05.904
- How long you been a backup singer?
- Too long.


979
00:56:07.154 --> 00:56:09.748
Oh, I just got hired for tonight...

980
00:56:09.907 --> 00:56:14.504
...but I was hoping that he would ask
me to go on tour with him. But...


981
00:56:14.661 --> 00:56:16.334
You could sing something for me.

982
00:56:16.496 --> 00:56:18.749
Oh, no. Ha-ha-ha. No.

983
00:56:18.916 --> 00:56:23.592
The only time that I do performances for audiences
of one is when I'm in the shower.


984
00:56:23.754 --> 00:56:26.849
- Well, you--
- Don't say anything.


985
00:56:28.342 --> 00:56:31.687
Anxiety is now the prevailing mood
here at One Times Square.


986
00:56:31.845 --> 00:56:33.722
The ball is still
in a state of stuck.

987
00:56:33.889 --> 00:56:37.985
--As officials await the arrival of
electrical whiz Lester Kominsky.


988
00:56:40.896 --> 00:56:43.524
Oh, I'm sorry, 
I don't speak Spanish. 
I'm from Ohio.

989
00:56:46.526 --> 00:56:48.699
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.


990
00:56:50.364 --> 00:56:53.038
- The eagle has landed.
- Kominsky's here.


991
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:56.875
Make a hole, people. Move.

992
00:57:04.503 --> 00:57:06.130
Kominsky.

993
00:57:07.673 --> 00:57:09.220
I'm Claire Morgan.

994
00:57:09.383 --> 00:57:10.805
Oh, no. Kominsky.

995
00:57:10.968 --> 00:57:13.141
- Kominsky's here, yes.
- Yes.


996
00:57:13.303 --> 00:57:16.102
Oh. Thank you so much for coming.

997
00:57:16.264 --> 00:57:17.811
Yes, it's good.

998
00:57:17.975 --> 00:57:22.321
- You fire me.
- No, no. No, that was someone else. No.


999
00:57:22.646 --> 00:57:24.819
So, what do you think it is?

1000
00:57:24.982 --> 00:57:26.780
- Short.
- What's short?


1001
00:57:26.942 --> 00:57:28.489
A short in the ball.

1002
00:57:28.652 --> 00:57:29.699
You got it.

1003
00:57:29.861 --> 00:57:31.738
- Sounds pretty straightforward.
- Mm-hm.


1004
00:57:31.905 --> 00:57:33.248
Easy to fix.

1005
00:57:33.407 --> 00:57:35.159
- Then you fix.
- No.


1006
00:57:35.325 --> 00:57:36.451
Not so easy.

1007
00:57:36.618 --> 00:57:38.962
This ball has 3500 lighting clues.

1008
00:57:39.121 --> 00:57:41.499
Cues. He means cues.

1009
00:57:41.665 --> 00:57:44.259
You have to find the light
that went out in over 3000?

1010
00:57:44.418 --> 00:57:45.795
- Mm-hm.
- Wh--?


1011
00:57:45.961 --> 00:57:50.262
Have we not progressed past the Christmas
lights that go out if there's one bad one?


1012
00:57:50.424 --> 00:57:54.395
My question also and then
I get fired, so that's all.

1013
00:57:54.553 --> 00:57:56.601
Oh, wait. We need you.

1014
00:57:57.973 --> 00:57:59.520
I need you.

1015
00:58:02.936 --> 00:58:07.737
Okay. Then I go visit
my ball on the roof. And...

1016
00:58:08.442 --> 00:58:09.739
These TV peoples here?

1017
00:58:10.193 --> 00:58:11.695
- Yes.
- Oh.


1018
00:58:11.862 --> 00:58:12.909
Here.

1019
00:58:13.947 --> 00:58:16.666
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1020
00:58:17.617 --> 00:58:18.994
Good. Thank you.

1021
00:58:19.161 --> 00:58:21.710
Please enjoy our New Year's Eve entertainment...

1022
00:58:21.872 --> 00:58:26.173
...as we go to Ginger Adams and some
young revelers in the 54th Street pen.


1023
00:58:26.334 --> 00:58:27.381
Ginger.

1024
00:58:27.544 --> 00:58:29.888
This little boy is lost. 
Go with the nice lady.

1025
00:58:30.338 --> 00:58:32.932
- What's your name?
- Scott. I can't find my mom.


1026
00:58:33.091 --> 00:58:35.185
Whoa! Who lost this kid?

1027
00:58:35.343 --> 00:58:36.811
I did, I did.

1028
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:38.096
I'm coming, Mom.

1029
00:58:38.263 --> 00:58:39.435
- I got him.
- Take it easy.


1030
00:58:39.598 --> 00:58:41.100
- Be careful.
- Whoa, thattaboy.


1031
00:58:41.266 --> 00:58:42.313
Watch it!

1032
00:58:42.476 --> 00:58:43.944
Mom, look at me.

1033
00:58:44.102 --> 00:58:45.479
I got him. I got him.

1034
00:58:48.106 --> 00:58:49.232
Hey, is she here?

1035
00:58:49.399 --> 00:58:53.654
I haven't seen Piper's mom, but I know
she's around here somewhere.


1036
00:58:55.155 --> 00:58:58.159
- Who are you gonna kiss at midnight?
- You, baby.


1037
00:58:58.325 --> 00:59:00.703
I'm flattered, but I'm also spoken for.

1038
00:59:01.286 --> 00:59:05.792
We now go live to New Year's headquarters
for an update on the situation.


1039
00:59:10.253 --> 00:59:13.848
Hello, I'm Claire Morgan
of the Times Square Alliance...

1040
00:59:14.007 --> 00:59:16.806
...and, as you all can see...

1041
00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:20.014
...the ball has stopped halfway to its perch.

1042
00:59:22.057 --> 00:59:24.276
It's suspended there to remind us...

1043
00:59:24.434 --> 00:59:29.031
...before we pop the champagne
and celebrate the new year...


1044
00:59:30.524 --> 00:59:33.869
...to stop...

1045
00:59:34.861 --> 00:59:38.035
...and reflect on the
year that has gone by.

1046
00:59:38.698 --> 00:59:43.920
To remember both our triumphs and our missteps.

1047
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:48.630
Our promises made and broken.

1048
00:59:50.836 --> 00:59:54.056
The times we opened ourselves
up to great adventures...


1049
00:59:54.631 --> 00:59:59.228
...or closed ourself down
for fear of getting hurt.

1050
01:00:00.554 --> 01:00:03.057
Because that's What New Year's is all about.

1051
01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:05.476
Getting another chance.

1052
01:00:06.852 --> 01:00:08.775
A chance to forgive.

1053
01:00:09.896 --> 01:00:15.073
To do better, to do more,
to give more, to love more.

1054
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:19.243
And to stop worrying about "what if"...

1055
01:00:19.406 --> 01:00:21.909
...and start embracing what will be.

1056
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:26.584
So when that ball drops at midnight...

1057
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.957
...and it will drop...

1058
01:00:29.124 --> 01:00:32.628
...let's remember to be nice to each other.

1059
01:00:34.337 --> 01:00:35.884
Kind to each other.

1060
01:00:36.715 --> 01:00:40.640
And not just tonight, but all year long.

1061
01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:44.932
Thank you.

1062
01:00:56.902 --> 01:00:58.700
I want to hear
the rest of your story.

1063
01:00:58.862 --> 01:01:02.162
We talked for... 
It felt like hours.

1064
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:04.618
- You boink her?
- Dad.


1065
01:01:04.784 --> 01:01:08.414
- You're talking to a man in a tuxedo.
- I can't talk like that in front of a lady.


1066
01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.299
- He's a gentleman.
- We talked, all right?


1067
01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:16.009
I went on and on about the business and
how our stock had just gone public.


1068
01:01:16.171 --> 01:01:18.720
She stops me, she puts her hand
over mine and she says:


1069
01:01:18.882 --> 01:01:20.930
"That's all great, but how's your heart?"

1070
01:01:22.302 --> 01:01:24.600
"How's your he--?" Who says that?

1071
01:01:24.763 --> 01:01:28.108
- I mean, I never met anyone that said that--
- Please. Please.


1072
01:01:28.266 --> 01:01:29.563
Did you at least kiss her?

1073
01:01:29.726 --> 01:01:31.194
Yes. At midnight.

1074
01:01:32.562 --> 01:01:33.859
And that's it?

1075
01:01:34.147 --> 01:01:38.027
Well, I went to the restroom a little
bit later and when I came back...


1076
01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:39.661
- ...she was gone.
- Oh.


1077
01:01:40.403 --> 01:01:42.906
- She left something on the table.
- Naked picture?


1078
01:01:43.073 --> 01:01:44.165
Let me see.

1079
01:01:47.786 --> 01:01:49.254
Read it out loud, Maude.

1080
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.127
"Things are complicated.

1081
01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:54.668
If you're still thinking
about me in a year...

1082
01:01:54.834 --> 01:01:57.508
...meet me back here at La Gambina Trattoria...

1083
01:01:57.671 --> 01:02:01.016
- ...at midnight next New Year's Eve."
- Midnight next New Year's Eve.


1084
01:02:01.174 --> 01:02:02.642
You memorized it.

1085
01:02:04.552 --> 01:02:06.304
You're gonna meet her, aren't you?

1086
01:02:06.596 --> 01:02:11.102
Yeah, I don't think so. I mean,
I don't even know her name.


1087
01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:13.103
You're afraid.

1088
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:17.150
She's not gonna be there. It was
one night. It wasn't even real.


1089
01:02:17.315 --> 01:02:22.116
But this napkin is. And you've been
carrying it around for a year.


1090
01:02:22.279 --> 01:02:24.373
I mean, you went out
for a slice of pizza...

1091
01:02:24.531 --> 01:02:27.751
...and you may have run into the one.

1092
01:02:27.909 --> 01:02:29.126
You know what that is?

1093
01:02:29.536 --> 01:02:31.584
- Insanity?
- Not insanity.


1094
01:02:31.997 --> 01:02:33.840
Serendipity. Hmm?

1095
01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:37.424
- And you don't mess with serendipity.
- What's the worst that could happen?


1096
01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:39.758
She doesn't show up, you
go back to your party.

1097
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:43.683
Oh, that's not it
at all, is it, Sam?

1098
01:02:45.093 --> 01:02:47.642
You're afraid that she will show up.

1099
01:02:49.055 --> 01:02:52.855
I'll tell you what. 
I'll take care of this for you.

1100
01:02:53.018 --> 01:02:55.567
- I can tap this.
- He can tap this.


1101
01:02:55.729 --> 01:02:58.482
I'm gonna step up and tap this
for you. Look, I'm a widower.


1102
01:02:58.648 --> 01:03:00.241
- Right?
- Forgive him.


1103
01:03:08.158 --> 01:03:10.752
- Hey, sis.
- Have you heard from Hailey?


1104
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:13.880
- Calm down. What, is she AWOL?
- Yes.


1105
01:03:14.039 --> 01:03:17.543
It's New Year's Eve. She's a teenager.
She's being her mother's daughter.


1106
01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:19.803
- Can you hold on for one second?
- Yeah, sure.


1107
01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:21.463
I can't see.

1108
01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.717
I was never that defiant.

1109
01:03:25.884 --> 01:03:29.104
I mean, you should've seen
the way she looked at me.

1110
01:03:29.262 --> 01:03:31.685
I'm confused. I thought you had plans tonight.

1111
01:03:31.848 --> 01:03:34.021
I sort of did. 
But I chose to be with Hailey...

1112
01:03:34.184 --> 01:03:36.027
...and now she's gone.

1113
01:03:36.186 --> 01:03:38.063
I'm not really worried about Hailey.

1114
01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:40.903
I'm more worried about you. 
If you're not working...

1115
01:03:41.066 --> 01:03:44.616
...you need to have some fun. Let your
hair down. Leave the clogs at home.


1116
01:03:44.778 --> 01:03:46.530
Oh, great, more clog commentary. Ooh.

1117
01:03:46.696 --> 01:03:48.915
Goodness. I'm so sorry, sir.

1118
01:03:49.074 --> 01:03:53.500
Listen, Paul, right now, all I really
need to do is just find Hailey.


1119
01:03:53.661 --> 01:03:54.708
All right, look.

1120
01:03:54.871 --> 01:03:57.374
She's a good kid, okay?

1121
01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:01.837
If she did happen to call her cool
uncle to say where she'd be...


1122
01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.424
...she may, in fact, have
said the 54th Street pen.

1123
01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.717
But please don't rat out the cool uncle.

1124
01:04:07.884 --> 01:04:10.683
Paul, thank you. Thank you so
much. Thank you. Excuse me.


1125
01:04:10.845 --> 01:04:12.222
Wait, wait! Sis, hold on.

1126
01:04:12.389 --> 01:04:15.563
- I got a huge favor to ask.
- Anything. What, what, what? What?


1127
01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:19.646
“Be amazed."

1128
01:04:19.813 --> 01:04:21.190
I got it.

1129
01:04:21.356 --> 01:04:24.075
Ingrid, please don't let
this whole thing be ruined...

1130
01:04:24.234 --> 01:04:26.157
...because I'm a big-mouthed idiot.

1131
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:29.322
I'm sick and tired of being that guy.

1132
01:04:30.281 --> 01:04:31.999
Please, Ingrid.

1133
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.202
Please.

1134
01:04:34.911 --> 01:04:36.504
Come with me.

1135
01:04:36.663 --> 01:04:37.915
Come on! Let's go.

1136
01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:39.424
On one condition.

1137
01:04:42.335 --> 01:04:45.339
- Whoo!
- Yeah, there you go.


1138
01:04:45.964 --> 01:04:47.011
Here we go!

1139
01:04:47.173 --> 01:04:50.427
- See? All right, right turn. Lean into it.
- Aah!


1140
01:04:50.593 --> 01:04:51.970
Lean, lean, lean

1141
01:04:53.263 --> 01:04:57.109
- That was a nice speech.
- Well, I was just trying to save my job.


1142
01:04:57.267 --> 01:04:59.190
No, I don't think so.

1143
01:04:59.936 --> 01:05:01.654
I think you were talking about you.

1144
01:05:01.813 --> 01:05:06.489
Okay, maybe I was, but
all I can do is reflect...

1145
01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:09.283
...and try and do better next year.

1146
01:05:09.446 --> 01:05:10.698
Or sooner.

1147
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.242
Now, why'd I tell you about him?

1148
01:05:14.409 --> 01:05:18.130
I'm a New York cop. 
People, they tell me things.

1149
01:05:18.288 --> 01:05:20.040
I'm sure he's forgotten it by now.

1150
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:21.416
You should go.

1151
01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:25.004
I don't move until the ball moves.

1152
01:05:25.753 --> 01:05:27.096
This is so exciting.

1153
01:05:27.255 --> 01:05:29.849
In my entire life, 
I have never won a contest before.

1154
01:05:30.008 --> 01:05:34.104
And I'm also excited about the baby.
I think that's the most exciting thing.


1155
01:05:35.346 --> 01:05:38.316
- Anchovy man.
- Yam liar.


1156
01:05:38.475 --> 01:05:41.729
- Grace, I'm gonna sign us in, okay?
- I'll just be right back.


1157
01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:51.363
- Griffin Byrne, checking in.
- Schwab, very proud to check in this hotel.


1158
01:05:51.529 --> 01:05:54.749
I'm sorry about James. 
He's very competitive.

1159
01:05:54.908 --> 01:05:59.755
Well, I should apologize too. I really
didn't mean that anything was on.


1160
01:05:59.913 --> 01:06:01.711
Ooh.

1161
01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:05.009
- Contractions?
- Six minutes apart.


1162
01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:06.511
We have five minutes apart.

1163
01:06:06.669 --> 01:06:08.012
- Cervix?
- She has one.


1164
01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:12.304
- Four centimeters dilated.
- Four? We are five-- Six-- Seven!


1165
01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:13.593
Maybe eight.

1166
01:06:16.262 --> 01:06:18.264
Don't you show your
head to me, young lady!

1167
01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:21.560
Not yet! Papa will tell
you when it's time, okay?

1168
01:06:22.143 --> 01:06:24.737
- Oh, please don't yell at my vagina.
- Oh, I never will.


1169
01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:25.943
It's amazing.

1170
01:06:26.105 --> 01:06:28.449
She really listens to James.

1171
01:06:28.608 --> 01:06:30.610
She just crawled right back up in there.

1172
01:06:32.111 --> 01:06:33.988
The nurses will take you to your rooms.

1173
01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.157
Gentlemen, to your corners.

1174
01:06:36.324 --> 01:06:39.453
And, ladies, may the best va-jay-jay win.

1175
01:06:41.246 --> 01:06:42.964
Good luck.

1176
01:06:46.292 --> 01:06:48.590
- Let's see it. Ha-ha-ha.
- Let's see it.


1177
01:06:48.753 --> 01:06:50.300
La la la

1178
01:06:50.463 --> 01:06:52.557
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll sing.

1179
01:06:52.715 --> 01:06:54.934
- You don't like my voice?
- You draw. I'll sing.


1180
01:06:55.093 --> 01:06:59.018
Laura, can we take a break? Jensen's
going on in a minute.


1181
01:07:00.098 --> 01:07:01.270
Do you want to go see?

1182
01:07:01.432 --> 01:07:05.312
No. I'm a professional, I can't be
seen gawking at the talent.


1183
01:07:05.478 --> 01:07:06.946
Well, I'm gonna gawk.

1184
01:07:07.146 --> 01:07:12.323
Ahh. I'm gonna try to get close to the
stage to get spit and sweat on.


1185
01:07:22.328 --> 01:07:26.049
When the road gets dark

1186
01:07:27.584 --> 01:07:32.841
And you can no longer see

1187
01:07:33.506 --> 01:07:37.807
Let my love throw a spark

1188
01:07:39.262 --> 01:07:44.268
And have a little faith in me

1189
01:07:50.773 --> 01:07:55.199
And when the tears you cry

1190
01:07:56.988 --> 01:08:01.835
Are all you can believe

1191
01:08:01.993 --> 01:08:06.794
Just give these loving arms a try, baby

1192
01:08:07.915 --> 01:08:12.045
And have a little faith in me

1193
01:08:12.211 --> 01:08:16.216
Have a little faith in me

1194
01:08:18.509 --> 01:08:21.729
Have a little faith in me

1195
01:08:24.307 --> 01:08:27.151
Have a little faith in me

1196
01:08:30.188 --> 01:08:34.489
Have a little faith in me

1197
01:08:37.362 --> 01:08:40.957
'Cause I've been loving you
For such a long time, girl

1198
01:08:41.115 --> 01:08:46.667
Expecting nothing in return Just for
you to have a little faith in me


1199
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:51.005
You see, time Time is our friend

1200
01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:53.420
'Cause for us, there is no end

1201
01:08:53.586 --> 01:08:58.683
All you gotta do Is, baby, have
a little bit of faith in me

1202
01:08:58.841 --> 01:09:02.266
I said, I will hold you
up I will hold you up

1203
01:09:02.428 --> 01:09:05.773
I will hold you up
I will hold you up now

1204
01:09:05.932 --> 01:09:09.937
All you gotta do Is

1205
01:09:10.103 --> 01:09:16.281

01:09:16.442 --> 01:09:19.116

All right, let me see.

1211

Let me see.

1212
01:10:03.406 --> 01:10:04.498
That's me?

1213
01:10:04.657 --> 01:10:06.250
I look crazy.

1214
01:10:07.285 --> 01:10:09.208
- Do you have any other hobbies?
- Ha-ha-ha.


1215
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:19.009
Hey.

1216
01:10:20.298 --> 01:10:21.595
There you...

1217
01:10:26.679 --> 01:10:28.147
You're so good.

1218
01:10:29.515 --> 01:10:30.687
You always were.

1219
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:33.478
I'm not really that good.

1220
01:10:33.644 --> 01:10:35.738
Yes, you are. Yeah.

1221
01:10:35.897 --> 01:10:38.525
I was thinking about the ball drop...

1222
01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.370
...and how that always
used to be our thing.

1223
01:10:42.862 --> 01:10:46.662
Remember when I took you to
New York for the first time?


1224
01:10:46.824 --> 01:10:49.623
We watched the ball drop together? You remember?

1225
01:10:50.286 --> 01:10:51.833
That was our night.

1226
01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.838
And I promised you we'd bring--

1227
01:10:57.376 --> 01:11:00.129
We would go back there...

1228
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:05.306
Well, another promise I didn't
live up to. I'm sorry.

1229
01:11:09.514 --> 01:11:11.107
Now, why did I leave you?

1230
01:11:15.937 --> 01:11:17.655
Stan, I'm Aimee.

1231
01:11:18.606 --> 01:11:20.700
Remember? Nurse Aimee?

1232
01:11:22.652 --> 01:11:24.074
Hmm?

1233
01:11:29.659 --> 01:11:32.208
Oh. Right.

1234
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.418
Right. Aimee.

1235
01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:49.896
Call me back or I'm gonna give away
your ticket. I'm gonna give it away.


1236
01:11:50.054 --> 01:11:51.727
Paul, it's me, Murray. 
Are we ready to go?

1237
01:11:51.889 --> 01:11:52.936
Let's go!

1238
01:11:53.307 --> 01:11:56.060
Ladies and gentlemen, one-night-only engagement.

1239
01:11:56.227 --> 01:12:00.983
Radio City Music Hall is proud to
present, on her resolution tour:


1240
01:12:01.274 --> 01:12:03.197
Ingrid Withers!

1241
01:12:03.359 --> 01:12:05.782
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling

1242
01:12:05.945 --> 01:12:07.572
Ring-ting-tingling too

1243
01:12:07.738 --> 01:12:09.081
All right.

1244
01:12:11.325 --> 01:12:13.669
- Oh, my God. Whoo!
- Bravo!


1245
01:12:13.828 --> 01:12:14.875
Bravo!

1246
01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:20.172
Are you amazed?

1247
01:12:20.501 --> 01:12:23.095
I'm amazed you got me to do this!

1248
01:12:23.254 --> 01:12:24.551
Amazing!

1249
01:12:24.797 --> 01:12:27.346
"Be amazed"? Check.

1250
01:12:29.844 --> 01:12:30.970
Come on, it's lovely weather

1251
01:12:34.473 --> 01:12:35.520
This is great.

1252
01:12:35.683 --> 01:12:37.481
This is great. Okay.

1253
01:12:38.019 --> 01:12:40.147
Okay. Let me down now.

1254
01:12:44.358 --> 01:12:48.283
We've been stuck in here for hours. I
can't believe nobody's found us yet.


1255
01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:55.544
- We could have our own party.
- Hmm.


1256
01:12:55.995 --> 01:12:57.668
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on!


1257
01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:02.552
We got to do something to get you
out of your New Year's Eve funk.


1258
01:13:05.087 --> 01:13:06.805
We're at a party.

1259
01:13:07.298 --> 01:13:08.345
Mm.

1260
01:13:09.926 --> 01:13:14.853
You're standing on one end of the
room alone, and I'm on the other.


1261
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.688
- We've never met.
- Ooh.


1262
01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:19.773
And the countdown begins.

1263
01:13:19.936 --> 01:13:23.361
You start scanning the room for cute girls...

1264
01:13:23.522 --> 01:13:25.775
...amongst the sea of couples.

1265
01:13:25.942 --> 01:13:27.285
- Cute girls.
- Ten.


1266
01:13:27.693 --> 01:13:28.865
Nine.

1267
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:30.867
Eight.

1268
01:13:31.864 --> 01:13:33.366
Seven.

1269
01:13:34.367 --> 01:13:36.165
Finally, you see me.

1270
01:13:36.327 --> 01:13:38.204
- Our eyes meet.
- There you are.


1271
01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:42.091
We smile tentatively at each other.

1272
01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:43.838
- Six.
- Tentatively.


1273
01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:47.634
Then we start walking towards each other.

1274
01:13:48.172 --> 01:13:49.389
Five.

1275
01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.467
Finally, we meet.

1276
01:13:51.634 --> 01:13:52.851
Four

1277
01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:55.058
Just as it's about to be midnight.

1278
01:13:55.972 --> 01:13:57.440
- Three.
- Three.


1279
01:13:59.141 --> 01:14:00.643
- Two.
- Two.


1280
01:14:03.646 --> 01:14:04.693
One.

1281
01:14:18.828 --> 01:14:19.875
Oh.

1282
01:14:20.037 --> 01:14:21.584
- Hey!
- Now you come.


1283
01:14:22.748 --> 01:14:24.091
Hmm.

1284
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:28.220
See, I told you I'd have it fixed. 
In just eight hours.

1285
01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:31.678
Phone's broken.

1286
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:35.721
Hey, you didn't, uh, you know...

1287
01:14:35.886 --> 01:14:37.888
That's not why we put the bench in.

1288
01:14:38.055 --> 01:14:41.355
Oh, no, no. It's not like that.

1289
01:14:41.517 --> 01:14:43.770
Yeah, it's always like that.

1290
01:14:43.936 --> 01:14:46.735
- This was not like that.
- Oh, it's always like that.


1291
01:14:46.897 --> 01:14:50.902
- We just met on--
- All right. I'll check out the video.


1292
01:14:51.736 --> 01:14:53.033
Okay.

1293
01:14:53.404 --> 01:14:55.577
All right! Come on in.

1294
01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.163
- Looks like you still might make your gig.
- Yeah.


1295
01:14:58.492 --> 01:15:00.244
So Jensen's playing at Times Square?

1296
01:15:00.411 --> 01:15:04.962
Yeah. With or without me,
so I should really get going.

1297
01:15:08.627 --> 01:15:10.049
Okay.

1298
01:15:11.547 --> 01:15:14.596
- See you.
- Yeah. Happy New-- Uh...


1299
01:15:15.342 --> 01:15:16.559
I'll see you.

1300
01:15:20.639 --> 01:15:21.811
Uh...

1301
01:15:21.974 --> 01:15:23.317
Let me--

1302
01:15:24.351 --> 01:15:25.443
Sorry.

1303
01:15:30.691 --> 01:15:31.738
Hold the elevator.

1304
01:15:33.069 --> 01:15:34.696
Sorry. Let me just...

1305
01:15:35.071 --> 01:15:37.119
This gate is a bitch.

1306
01:15:46.874 --> 01:15:49.878
- Mrs. Lifﬂander, you've been working out.
- Thank you.


1307
01:15:55.341 --> 01:15:57.343
Hey, you forgot--!

1308
01:16:01.263 --> 01:16:03.436
Oh, this is amazing, 
I can totally see him.

1309
01:16:03.766 --> 01:16:07.020
What?! He's coming out? 
You can see him?

1310
01:16:07.478 --> 01:16:09.901
Okay, if you try
to see, I can't see.

1311
01:16:10.064 --> 01:16:11.782
Look with your other eye!

1312
01:16:11.941 --> 01:16:15.161
Oh, hostility, that's good. Yes,
now we're getting somewhere.


1313
01:16:15.319 --> 01:16:18.619
I can't see the baby. I can see that
couple trying to steal our money.


1314
01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:20.033
Oh, this is great, babe.

1315
01:16:20.199 --> 01:16:23.078
So, look, if I do this, that means
they're having their baby.


1316
01:16:23.244 --> 01:16:24.917
I don't care about the money anymore.

1317
01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:27.457
- What?
- Hey, Griff?


1318
01:16:27.623 --> 01:16:28.715
Come here.

1319
01:16:29.667 --> 01:16:33.046
- You are disturbing her calm zone.
- You're disturbing my calm zone.


1320
01:16:33.212 --> 01:16:34.680
What? Uhn.

1321
01:16:36.298 --> 01:16:38.426
I need you to focus.

1322
01:16:39.343 --> 01:16:43.849
I'm just trying to squeeze a giant Escalade
out of a compact fucking parking spot!


1323
01:16:44.515 --> 01:16:45.767
Nice.

1324
01:16:45.933 --> 01:16:49.403
Swearing helps sometimes. But now
we're gonna use our words, right?


1325
01:16:50.521 --> 01:16:52.194
- We're ready to go.
- Uh...


1326
01:16:53.566 --> 01:16:54.613
Bye, I love you.

1327
01:16:54.775 --> 01:16:57.824
- Time to take the children to the playroom.
- Come on, guys.


1328
01:16:57.987 --> 01:17:01.992
Next time I see you, you're gonna
have a baby sister. I love you.


1329
01:17:02.158 --> 01:17:04.206
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye.


1330
01:17:04.368 --> 01:17:06.917
- A lobster?
- Yeah.


1331
01:17:07.079 --> 01:17:08.376
Dissolve.

1332
01:17:08.539 --> 01:17:10.462
Dissolve.

1333
01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:14.925
Assuage.

1334
01:17:20.217 --> 01:17:22.185
Very good. You are the channel.

1335
01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.893
I am the perfect channel.

1336
01:17:25.055 --> 01:17:26.853
- Perfect channel.
- Ooh...


1337
01:17:27.183 --> 01:17:28.605
Okay.

1338
01:17:29.393 --> 01:17:32.112
- Change the channel. Change it!
- Mm-hm.


1339
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:33.614
Click, click, click.

1340
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:46.039
- Watch it.
- What happened to the steps there? Hey.


1341
01:17:46.493 --> 01:17:50.214
It's been a real treat getting to know
you and the family. Grandpa Jed.


1342
01:17:50.372 --> 01:17:51.544
Very cool, very horny.

1343
01:17:51.707 --> 01:17:54.301
You got a chance to see
how the other half lives, huh?

1344
01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.258
You make the other half look good.

1345
01:17:56.462 --> 01:17:58.931
Ah. You seem to
have a pretty fun life.

1346
01:17:59.089 --> 01:18:00.215
It has its moments.

1347
01:18:00.382 --> 01:18:03.807
- Remember, follow your heart.
- All right, I will. I'll see you.


1348
01:18:07.973 --> 01:18:09.646
- You have to let me in!
- I'm sorry.


1349
01:18:09.808 --> 01:18:11.401
You need a pass to get back there.

1350
01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.109
I'm practically related to him. 
We're both from Jersey.

1351
01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:16.865
- Is this the 54th Street pen?
- 56th. 54th is that way.


1352
01:18:17.024 --> 01:18:19.777
- You have to let me in.
- Without a pass, I can't.


1353
01:18:22.488 --> 01:18:25.162
- Hailey's coming.
- Yeah.


1354
01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:29.336
We're getting closer, folks. 
Hope you're staying warm.

1355
01:18:30.704 --> 01:18:35.084
This is it. This is as close to the
ball dropping as I can get you.


1356
01:18:35.251 --> 01:18:37.970
Hey, good luck with
that last one, all right?

1357
01:18:38.128 --> 01:18:39.175
No.

1358
01:18:39.338 --> 01:18:43.059
- I figured that was a long shot.
- A long shot? What are you talking about?


1359
01:18:43.217 --> 01:18:45.185
Going to Bali? 
That was a long shot.

1360
01:18:47.596 --> 01:18:49.189
Let's get this out of here, okay?

1361
01:18:49.348 --> 01:18:52.147
Man, I don't even know whose
this is, bro. I'm just saying.


1362
01:18:52.434 --> 01:18:53.481
Thanks.

1363
01:18:54.478 --> 01:18:55.946
Make a list of your own.

1364
01:18:56.647 --> 01:18:58.490
Don't wait as long as I did.

1365
01:18:58.691 --> 01:19:00.489
Pow, pow, shwing.

1366
01:19:00.651 --> 01:19:02.699
Thank you. Mm.

1367
01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:05.323
Goodbye.

1368
01:19:07.616 --> 01:19:08.708
Goodbye.

1369
01:19:10.828 --> 01:19:14.002
- Have a great time.
- You too. Happy New Year, Ingrid.


1370
01:19:16.542 --> 01:19:18.215
Whoo.

1371
01:19:26.802 --> 01:19:29.897
Any ideas who you might
want to kiss at midnight?

1372
01:19:30.055 --> 01:19:31.432
Oh.

1373
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.313
- Hey, Laura!
- Ha-ha-ha.


1374
01:19:33.475 --> 01:19:35.773
- They're raving about the food out there.
- Great.


1375
01:19:35.936 --> 01:19:38.906
I hear this is a
first for the music industry.

1376
01:19:39.315 --> 01:19:42.068
- Sam's here.
- He is.


1377
01:19:42.651 --> 01:19:44.119
- Sam!
- Oh, hey, Alyssa.


1378
01:19:44.278 --> 01:19:46.155
- I'll get your favorite drink?
- Thank you.


1379
01:19:47.948 --> 01:19:49.791
Hey, Mom.

1380
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:51.042
Sorry I'm late.

1381
01:19:51.201 --> 01:19:52.453
But I made it.

1382
01:19:52.619 --> 01:19:55.213
Thank you for wearing your father's tuxedo.

1383
01:19:55.372 --> 01:19:58.467
- Perfect fit, huh?
- You look so handsome.


1384
01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:00.627
Hey there, iPod. How are you?

1385
01:20:00.836 --> 01:20:02.634
All your pretty little girls are here.

1386
01:20:02.796 --> 01:20:04.764
I'm starting to think I need more...

1387
01:20:04.923 --> 01:20:07.517
...than a pretty a girl
with nothing to say, you know?

1388
01:20:07.676 --> 01:20:09.519
Did maturity just walk into the room?

1389
01:20:09.928 --> 01:20:11.896
Well, maybe, maybe not.

1390
01:20:12.681 --> 01:20:14.809
You know what you're
gonna say to these people?

1391
01:20:15.225 --> 01:20:17.728
Yes. Yes, I do.

1392
01:20:17.936 --> 01:20:22.692
Coming up next on the main stage, Ahern
Records recording artist, Jensen!


1393
01:20:25.444 --> 01:20:27.412
- Where's Jensen?
- Still waiting on him.


1394
01:20:27.571 --> 01:20:31.121
But the president of the Times Square
Alliance would like a word.


1395
01:20:31.283 --> 01:20:34.287
- Mr. Buellerton's here?
- He's right here.


1396
01:20:36.288 --> 01:20:38.290
Mr. Buellerton. 
You wanted to see me?

1397
01:20:38.457 --> 01:20:39.959
Yes, Claire.

1398
01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:42.548
You spoke eloquently about the ball getting stuck.

1399
01:20:42.711 --> 01:20:44.884
- You assuaged everyone's fears.
- Thank you.


1400
01:20:45.047 --> 01:20:47.141
- Except mine.
- Oh, of course.


1401
01:20:47.299 --> 01:20:50.553
Now, I like assuagion, but I don't
think you realize what's at stake.


1402
01:20:50.719 --> 01:20:51.766
Oh, I do, sir.

1403
01:20:51.929 --> 01:20:54.398
You're about to letdown
the city of New York...

1404
01:20:54.556 --> 01:20:58.106
...the country, the whole world,
unless you get that ball fixed.


1405
01:20:59.686 --> 01:21:04.658
With all due respect, sir, I've been watching
the ball drop since I was 5 years old...


1406
01:21:04.817 --> 01:21:07.445
...and it's one of
my most favorite family memories.

1407
01:21:07.611 --> 01:21:09.613
We'll-
- We'll be sure to get this fixed.

1408
01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.327
"We'll"? "We'll"?

1409
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:14.334
You remember the '86 Mets
-Red Sox World Series?

1410
01:21:14.493 --> 01:21:15.619
No.

1411
01:21:15.994 --> 01:21:18.497
Bill Buckner let a ground
ball go between his legs...

1412
01:21:18.705 --> 01:21:21.925
...and the Sox lost the game, and
eventually, the World Series.


1413
01:21:22.084 --> 01:21:25.179
Now, very few people remember
who was on the field that day...


1414
01:21:25.337 --> 01:21:28.762
...but everyone remembers that
Buckner missed the ball.


1415
01:21:28.924 --> 01:21:32.019
A baseball's a lot smaller than your
ball, which is not dropping.


1416
01:21:32.177 --> 01:21:36.933
Right. I'll be sure that I don't drop
the ball on the ball drop.


1417
01:21:37.099 --> 01:21:39.352
- Whatever you said. Anyway, fix it.
- I will.


1418
01:21:39.518 --> 01:21:43.773
Or you'll hear a speech about the new vice
president of the Times Square Alliance.


1419
01:21:43.939 --> 01:21:47.284
Okay. I'm not gonna let you down,
or the world. I promise, sir.


1420
01:21:48.527 --> 01:21:52.327
Um, okay, I'm gonna check on
Kominsky. You find Jensen.


1421
01:21:52.865 --> 01:21:54.708
Somebody get me Jensen!

1422
01:21:54.867 --> 01:21:57.461
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Okay. Who are you?


1423
01:21:57.619 --> 01:21:59.667
I'm Elise, one of Jensen's backup singers.

1424
01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:00.956
Where's Jensen?

1425
01:22:01.123 --> 01:22:02.215
I don't know.

1426
01:22:02.374 --> 01:22:04.342
Go take the stage. 
That way, that way.

1427
01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:06.629
- Where is he?
- Still no rock star.


1428
01:22:06.795 --> 01:22:09.890
- Hey! 5B! Hi.
- Hey. Hi. Randy.


1429
01:22:10.048 --> 01:22:11.721
How'd you get in?

1430
01:22:11.884 --> 01:22:14.057
They think I'm Jensen's drummer.

1431
01:22:14.219 --> 01:22:15.391
Because I told them that.

1432
01:22:15.804 --> 01:22:20.560
Here. You left this on the elevator. I didn't
know if it was lucky or something.


1433
01:22:20.767 --> 01:22:22.189
And also it's a balance thing.

1434
01:22:22.352 --> 01:22:26.653
So if you dance while you're singing,
you'll need your balance.


1435
01:22:26.815 --> 01:22:27.862
Thanks.

1436
01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:33.497
You came all the way here to bring
me my rubber bracelet?


1437
01:22:33.655 --> 01:22:34.952
Sort of.

1438
01:22:35.115 --> 01:22:38.335
And to say happy New Year.

1439
01:22:41.747 --> 01:22:43.590
Happy New Year, Randy.

1440
01:22:45.876 --> 01:22:48.595
Oh, you also left
something else on the elevator.

1441
01:23:00.057 --> 01:23:01.604
Glad you remembered that.

1442
01:23:02.893 --> 01:23:04.941
Background singers report to stage.

1443
01:23:05.562 --> 01:23:06.939
I gotta go. Ha-ha.

1444
01:23:07.105 --> 01:23:08.778
Okay, well, go watch.

1445
01:23:08.941 --> 01:23:12.571
- For you, I will be your groupie.
- Thank you. Thank you.


1446
01:23:12.736 --> 01:23:14.909
Hey! Nice pajamas.

1447
01:23:15.072 --> 01:23:17.040
Background singers report to stage.

1448
01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:19.622
Keep them busy. 
Try doing the wave.

1449
01:23:19.785 --> 01:23:22.459
If Jensen doesn't show up, you're gonna sing.

1450
01:23:22.621 --> 01:23:24.294
- Jensen's here.
- Where?


1451
01:23:24.456 --> 01:23:26.800
- He's not happy.
- Oh. Why would he be?


1452
01:23:29.586 --> 01:23:32.931
Mr. Jensen, hi. 
What seems to be the problem?

1453
01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:35.434
Yeah, I saw your speech on TV today.

1454
01:23:35.592 --> 01:23:38.641
I'm Claire Morgan. 
I'm the one that hired you.

1455
01:23:38.804 --> 01:23:40.977
Hi. Boy meets girl...

1456
01:23:41.139 --> 01:23:44.439
- ...boy screws up, boy loses girl.
- Oh.


1457
01:23:44.643 --> 01:23:47.487
Um... Is there any
way I can help you?

1458
01:23:47.646 --> 01:23:49.114
I don't think so.

1459
01:23:49.273 --> 01:23:52.493
Well, it is New Year's Eve. 
Anything's possible.

1460
01:23:52.651 --> 01:23:55.325
Not this time. 
I think I really screwed it up.

1461
01:23:55.487 --> 01:23:57.990
I don't think I deserve a second chance.

1462
01:23:58.824 --> 01:24:00.371
You know what that feels like?

1463
01:24:01.952 --> 01:24:04.205
Actually, I do.

1464
01:24:04.371 --> 01:24:08.001
I have the same
situation going on right now.

1465
01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:09.588
Um...

1466
01:24:11.003 --> 01:24:14.303
Maybe all this is too much for her,
huh? I don't know. Maybe...


1467
01:24:16.008 --> 01:24:19.512
Maybe all she wants is to not have to
share you with the rest of the world.


1468
01:24:21.638 --> 01:24:23.015
Sounds familiar.

1469
01:24:23.181 --> 01:24:25.684
- We girls, we have a handbook.
- Miss Morgan.


1470
01:24:27.686 --> 01:24:32.783
Um... Well, I need to go fix the ball, and
you need to fix what you broke too.


1471
01:24:32.941 --> 01:24:34.534
But will you please sing first?

1472
01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:35.993
Please.

1473
01:24:36.445 --> 01:24:40.621
And don't forget, second chances,
they don't expire until midnight.


1474
01:24:41.033 --> 01:24:42.330
Okay?

1475
01:24:43.452 --> 01:24:44.874
Thanks.

1476
01:24:45.454 --> 01:24:46.956
You rock.

1477
01:24:47.122 --> 01:24:48.874
- Ha-ha.
- I'm a big fan.


1478
01:24:49.374 --> 01:24:50.671
Thank you.

1479
01:24:50.834 --> 01:24:53.553
Goodbye, 2011!

1480
01:24:55.464 --> 01:24:57.216
New Year's wave!

1481
01:24:57.466 --> 01:25:01.562
Hi. I am Sam Ahern, Jr.

1482
01:25:02.512 --> 01:25:03.889
I won't give a long speech.

1483
01:25:04.056 --> 01:25:07.401
Socrates gave long speeches
and his friends killed him.

1484
01:25:09.186 --> 01:25:12.235
In the past, my father
would always kick things off...

1485
01:25:12.397 --> 01:25:14.650
...and then turn it
over to the vice presidents...

1486
01:25:14.816 --> 01:25:17.365
...but as you know, 
Dad's not with us anymore.

1487
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:22.576
I think that anybody that knew him
knows that he was a great man.


1488
01:25:24.534 --> 01:25:27.287
And we're thinking about you tonight, Pops.

1489
01:25:30.374 --> 01:25:31.751
He always ended with a quote.

1490
01:25:31.917 --> 01:25:36.718
He would say, "What would you do today
if you knew you would not fail?"


1491
01:25:37.172 --> 01:25:40.221
And then he'd say, “Now
go out and do it."

1492
01:25:41.176 --> 01:25:43.144
You know where he got that from?

1493
01:25:44.221 --> 01:25:46.690
My mother, Rose Ahern.

1494
01:25:49.101 --> 01:25:53.732
All right, let me finish with this. As we
move forward into this new year...


1495
01:25:54.272 --> 01:25:57.742
...let's try to remember that sometimes it's okay...

1496
01:25:57.901 --> 01:25:59.619
...to listen to your heart.

1497
01:25:59.778 --> 01:26:01.701
I know it's risky.

1498
01:26:03.198 --> 01:26:04.996
Take that leap of faith.

1499
01:26:06.618 --> 01:26:08.461
Happy New Year, everybody.

1500
01:26:11.498 --> 01:26:12.875
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1501
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:14.634
All right, let's do this.

1502
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.962
Ladies and gentlemen, Jensen!

1503
01:26:31.059 --> 01:26:33.653
Come here! Why don't you
have one on? Come on!

1504
01:26:37.065 --> 01:26:39.488
I can't turn you loose now

1505
01:26:39.651 --> 01:26:43.155
If I do I'm gonna lose my life

1506
01:26:43.321 --> 01:26:45.665
I'm never turning you loose now

1507
01:26:45.824 --> 01:26:49.328
If I do I'm gonna lose my mind

1508
01:26:49.494 --> 01:26:51.917
I can't turn you loose to nobody

1509
01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.334
Cause I love you
baby Yes, I do now

1510
01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.174
Hip-shaking mama, I told ya

1511
01:26:58.336 --> 01:27:01.260
Oh, honey, I'm in love with you now

1512
01:27:02.674 --> 01:27:04.017
It's okay. They got it.

1513
01:27:04.176 --> 01:27:07.100
I wanna give you everything That you want

1514
01:27:07.262 --> 01:27:09.185
Gotta, gotta, gotta

1515
01:27:09.347 --> 01:27:12.396
Keep on lovin', baby

1516
01:27:12.559 --> 01:27:14.857
Never gonna turn you loose

1517
01:27:16.354 --> 01:27:20.530
I gotta keep on Huh!

1518
01:27:33.622 --> 01:27:35.169
After.

1519
01:27:35.373 --> 01:27:39.048
Okay, almost. One more test. One
more test, my darling. Okay.


1520
01:27:39.211 --> 01:27:41.179
I get this wire here.

1521
01:27:41.338 --> 01:27:42.885
Uh...

1522
01:27:43.048 --> 01:27:44.095
I got it!

1523
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:47.723
I put new one inside! Okay, baby!

1524
01:27:48.053 --> 01:27:50.021
- Mwah!
- Does it work?


1525
01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.023
Flip switch!

1526
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:55.064
I'm flipping. I'm flipping up.

1527
01:27:57.354 --> 01:27:58.401
It's working.

1528
01:27:59.022 --> 01:28:01.571
It's going up. 
It's going up!

1529
01:28:01.733 --> 01:28:04.987
Hang on, Kominsky! 
Tell Miss Morgan it's working.

1530
01:28:05.153 --> 01:28:06.405
He's got it!

1531
01:28:09.616 --> 01:28:12.335
Wait, wait! get me down first! First, down!

1532
01:28:12.494 --> 01:28:14.542
Coming down! Flipping down!

1533
01:28:14.871 --> 01:28:16.373
Way to go, buddy!

1534
01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:18.542
Mr. Kominsky, tell us, how does it feel?

1535
01:28:18.708 --> 01:28:20.881
Well, it feels okay. 
Everyone talking at me.

1536
01:28:21.044 --> 01:28:22.671
Wade said the mayor called.

1537
01:28:22.838 --> 01:28:24.590
- He wants you to come down there.
- Now?


1538
01:28:24.756 --> 01:28:27.430
He thought what you said a
lot of us needed to hear.

1539
01:28:27.759 --> 01:28:30.228
Tell Mayor Bloomberg I'd love to.

1540
01:28:32.931 --> 01:28:37.357
But I have another pressing matter
that needs attending.


1541
01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.118
- Mr. Kominsky?
- Yes.


1542
01:28:45.277 --> 01:28:48.702
As a reward for 37 years of service...

1543
01:28:48.864 --> 01:28:52.414
...before being temporarily relieved of your duties...

1544
01:28:52.576 --> 01:28:55.295
...I officially hereby leave you in charge.

1545
01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:00.633
What took so long?

1546
01:29:01.126 --> 01:29:02.173
Thank you.

1547
01:29:03.044 --> 01:29:04.091
Thank you.

1548
01:29:07.549 --> 01:29:08.641
Watch him like a hawk.

1549
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:11.929
You got it. Let me find
Nolan to give you a lift, though.

1550
01:29:12.095 --> 01:29:13.768
Officer Nolan's right here.

1551
01:29:15.056 --> 01:29:16.524
Hi.

1552
01:29:19.769 --> 01:29:20.941
Hi, Tanya.

1553
01:29:21.104 --> 01:29:22.572
Go see your daddy.

1554
01:29:23.481 --> 01:29:24.903
Hey, baby.

1555
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:27.577
Hi, Daddy.

1556
01:29:27.736 --> 01:29:29.329
My little rug rats

1557
01:29:29.487 --> 01:29:30.909
Heard you need a lift.

1558
01:29:31.072 --> 01:29:33.495
No. In a car.

1559
01:29:33.825 --> 01:29:35.418
Yeah, we have cars too.

1560
01:29:36.494 --> 01:29:37.837
Happy New Year, Brendan.

1561
01:29:37.996 --> 01:29:39.623
Happy New Year, Claire.

1562
01:29:40.749 --> 01:29:42.626
Ah... Alyssa, thank you.

1563
01:29:42.792 --> 01:29:45.466
Your favorite, 
Disaronno and cranberry.

1564
01:29:46.504 --> 01:29:49.007
Um... I'm off at 1.

1565
01:29:49.716 --> 01:29:52.344
- I will keep that in mind.
- Okay.


1566
01:29:53.345 --> 01:29:54.597
Hey, Sam.

1567
01:29:54.763 --> 01:29:57.266
- Wendy! How are you?
- Great.


1568
01:29:57.432 --> 01:29:58.934
- You look fantastic.
- Thanks.


1569
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.147
Sam?

1570
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:02.529
- Patty.
- I'd love to be the woman behind you.


1571
01:30:02.687 --> 01:30:05.031
And I'd love to be in front.

1572
01:30:05.231 --> 01:30:07.529
Oh. I'm a Sam-wich.

1573
01:30:09.611 --> 01:30:12.034
- How's everything? Okay?
- It was wonderful.


1574
01:30:12.197 --> 01:30:13.619
- It was delicious.
- Thank you.


1575
01:30:13.782 --> 01:30:16.205
I have to say
that he was absolutely right.

1576
01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:18.120
The food is sublime.

1577
01:30:18.286 --> 01:30:21.290
Thank you. Thank you so much. 
That's great to hear.

1578
01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:22.628
Who was right?

1579
01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:27.429
Jensen. He told us that we had to hire
you or he wouldn't sing tonight.


1580
01:30:27.712 --> 01:30:28.759
Ah.

1581
01:30:28.922 --> 01:30:32.392
I'm gonna recommend you to everyone I know,
and, honey, I know a lot of people.


1582
01:30:32.676 --> 01:30:34.223
Thank you.

1583
01:30:39.516 --> 01:30:42.395
I'll give you my new
condo number and my new cell.

1584
01:30:43.645 --> 01:30:46.398
You ran out on us last New Year's.
Do you remember that?


1585
01:30:46.564 --> 01:30:47.565
Here you go.

1586
01:30:49.818 --> 01:30:51.161
Fun.

1587
01:30:51.361 --> 01:30:53.079
You know what? I'm sorry.

1588
01:30:53.571 --> 01:30:55.790
I can't do it. I gotta go.

1589
01:30:57.575 --> 01:30:59.122
I'm sorry.

1590
01:31:01.246 --> 01:31:03.044
Make a hole, people!

1591
01:31:23.476 --> 01:31:24.944
Stan.

1592
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:27.238
It's just me, Aimee.

1593
01:31:28.565 --> 01:31:32.286
Please go. I don't want
you to see it happen.

1594
01:31:32.444 --> 01:31:34.572
No, I'm not gonna leave you alone.

1595
01:31:34.738 --> 01:31:35.830
He's not alone.

1596
01:31:47.792 --> 01:31:49.135
Hi, Daddy.

1597
01:31:52.922 --> 01:31:55.141
Hey. Kiddo.

1598
01:31:57.844 --> 01:31:59.812
Hey, kid.

1599
01:32:00.221 --> 01:32:01.814
Did we miss it?

1600
01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.563
Ball hasn't dropped yet.

1601
01:32:06.144 --> 01:32:07.862
You're really here.

1602
01:32:08.772 --> 01:32:10.115
Yeah.

1603
01:32:13.276 --> 01:32:15.449
Well, my shift is up.

1604
01:32:15.612 --> 01:32:18.240
- Have a happy New Year, Aimee.
- Thank you.


1605
01:32:18.406 --> 01:32:22.331
- How about some holiday cake?
- Nope. Don't need it.


1606
01:32:24.412 --> 01:32:27.006
Dessert is now being served.

1607
01:32:30.668 --> 01:32:32.011
Chocolate truffles.

1608
01:32:33.171 --> 01:32:34.844
This is working!

1609
01:32:35.173 --> 01:32:38.677
- I'm gonna grab some more parachutes.
- Okay. We'll keep throwing.


1610
01:32:38.885 --> 01:32:41.013
Throw it at the pretty ones!

1611
01:32:41.679 --> 01:32:45.775
I really would like to speak with
you about Miss Pearlman.


1612
01:32:45.934 --> 01:32:47.857
She's not doing too well today.

1613
01:32:48.019 --> 01:32:51.193
She has a high fever, but he didn't
really leave any more orders.


1614
01:32:51.356 --> 01:32:54.656
So we really would like you to come
in and take a look at her.


1615
01:32:54.818 --> 01:32:56.411
Thank you, bye.

1616
01:32:58.655 --> 01:33:01.158
- So, what do you think?
- Wow.


1617
01:33:01.324 --> 01:33:04.043
Somebody's gonna have a happy New Year.

1618
01:33:04.452 --> 01:33:06.830
I sure hope so.

1619
01:33:07.205 --> 01:33:09.424
- Ha-ha.
- Aimee, Aimee!


1620
01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:11.710
Come here. Quick, quick.

1621
01:33:12.335 --> 01:33:15.680
- Mr. Harris isn't in his bed.
- I know.


1622
01:33:15.839 --> 01:33:18.513
- So should I look for him?
- No. It's okay.


1623
01:33:18.758 --> 01:33:19.805
You look hot.

1624
01:33:23.221 --> 01:33:24.643
I can do this.

1625
01:33:25.557 --> 01:33:27.025
I can do this.

1626
01:33:27.183 --> 01:33:29.151
Hang in there, babydoll.

1627
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:33.322
We made it on time.

1628
01:33:33.481 --> 01:33:35.950
- It's our thing.
- Yeah.


1629
01:33:36.651 --> 01:33:39.575
You want me to
put you on my shoulders?

1630
01:33:45.201 --> 01:33:47.249
Wowee-wow.

1631
01:33:47.412 --> 01:33:50.416
Where in the world is
the rest of that dress?

1632
01:33:50.582 --> 01:33:52.710
New Year's is all about the dress.

1633
01:33:52.876 --> 01:33:55.174
You said that we could change before dessert.

1634
01:33:55.336 --> 01:33:57.589
There's nothing wrong in show a little something.

1635
01:33:57.755 --> 01:34:00.053
Trust me, but there's nothing little about those.

1636
01:34:00.216 --> 01:34:03.595
- What, did one fell off?
- No, no. They didn't fall off.


1637
01:34:03.761 --> 01:34:06.355
They are still there. You look great. 
Perfect, in fact.

1638
01:34:06.514 --> 01:34:08.437
You mind taking these parachutes upstairs?

1639
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.227
- Okay.
- Thank you.


1640
01:34:10.393 --> 01:34:12.771
You're going out there to celebrate with us?

1641
01:34:12.979 --> 01:34:15.448
No. I'll just hang here.

1642
01:34:16.774 --> 01:34:18.617
No, it's fine. I'm good.

1643
01:34:18.776 --> 01:34:20.449
Okay, I take the parachutes.

1644
01:34:20.612 --> 01:34:22.080
Thank you.

1645
01:34:30.205 --> 01:34:33.334
Dr. Steam, to the Ira Keenan lounge.

1646
01:34:47.805 --> 01:34:48.977
Hi.

1647
01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.141
What do you think?

1648
01:34:50.308 --> 01:34:54.279
Oh, I love it, I love it. 
You look so beautiful

1649
01:34:54.437 --> 01:34:56.610
I think I need to be there.

1650
01:34:56.814 --> 01:34:59.317
Ha-ha. I think I wish you were.

1651
01:35:00.568 --> 01:35:02.161
Hi, baby.

1652
01:35:02.946 --> 01:35:03.993
How've you been?

1653
01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:06.499
I'm okay.

1654
01:35:07.075 --> 01:35:10.579
The guys are all watching Times
Square on TV right now.


1655
01:35:10.828 --> 01:35:13.832
I tell them I'm better off. 
I'm watching you.

1656
01:35:17.085 --> 01:35:20.806
I miss you so much.

1657
01:35:22.757 --> 01:35:24.976
I miss you too, baby.

1658
01:35:26.010 --> 01:35:27.387
I do.

1659
01:35:27.804 --> 01:35:32.184
But you know what? This is gonna
be a great new year...


1660
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:35.103
...because you're coming home really soon.

1661
01:35:36.854 --> 01:35:38.026
I hope so.

1662
01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.112
You are.

1663
01:35:40.275 --> 01:35:42.323
Yeah. Happy New Year.

1664
01:35:43.861 --> 01:35:45.704
Happy New Year.

1665
01:35:55.373 --> 01:35:56.920
Kitchen still open?

1666
01:36:00.503 --> 01:36:01.720
Mm-hm.

1667
01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:03.927
Yep.

1668
01:36:13.057 --> 01:36:14.604
For dessert it is.

1669
01:36:14.892 --> 01:36:18.237
- Ha-ha.
- We got Jell-O. We got cupcakes, truffles.


1670
01:36:18.604 --> 01:36:19.901
Mm.

1671
01:36:20.064 --> 01:36:23.819
So you talked Mrs. 
Ahern into hiring me tonight, huh?

1672
01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:28.240
Well, I knew you had a lot of other offers
and I wanted you to take this one.


1673
01:36:28.406 --> 01:36:30.659
I really wanted to talk to you.

1674
01:36:31.451 --> 01:36:34.455
Well, I'm glad you did.

1675
01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.839
I'm glad we had a chance to talk.

1676
01:36:39.417 --> 01:36:40.589
I'm canceling the tour.

1677
01:36:44.047 --> 01:36:45.094
Why?

1678
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:46.682
Because of you.

1679
01:36:48.343 --> 01:36:51.893
I'm never gonna leave you again. Ever.

1680
01:36:52.055 --> 01:36:54.604
The best decision I made was
asking you to marry me...


1681
01:36:54.766 --> 01:36:57.064
...and the worst decision I made was sprinting.

1682
01:36:57.810 --> 01:37:00.438
I plan to make it up
to you as long as it takes.

1683
01:37:02.148 --> 01:37:03.741
Well...

1684
01:37:04.275 --> 01:37:09.452
...you do realize that it could be an awfully
long time before I choose to forgive you.


1685
01:37:09.614 --> 01:37:13.790
I mean, we could be old and gray
before I choose to forgive you.


1686
01:37:14.702 --> 01:37:15.794
I'll wait.

1687
01:37:18.873 --> 01:37:23.970
It could be years of make-up sex
before I choose to forgive you.


1688
01:37:24.462 --> 01:37:25.463
I'll suffer.

1689
01:37:28.299 --> 01:37:31.178
It's almost midnight. 
You wanna go to a party?

1690
01:37:31.511 --> 01:37:36.187
Let's do it! Please welcome Mayor
Bloomberg, ladies and gentlemen!


1691
01:37:38.601 --> 01:37:39.648
Nice to see you, sir.

1692
01:37:39.811 --> 01:37:41.734
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you. Shall we?


1693
01:37:41.896 --> 01:37:44.866
I think it's time. 
Let's drop the ball. 
What do you say?

1694
01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:47.527
Here we go!

1695
01:37:48.528 --> 01:37:51.327
All right, New York City! 
Are you ready?!

1696
01:37:52.657 --> 01:37:54.330
One minute to go.

1697
01:37:54.492 --> 01:37:57.496
Let's start the countdown when we hit 10.

1698
01:37:57.662 --> 01:38:00.040
And here comes the ball.

1699
01:38:01.582 --> 01:38:02.754
Uh-huh.

1700
01:38:02.917 --> 01:38:04.339
There it goes.

1701
01:38:04.502 --> 01:38:06.004
Dad, aren't you gonna be cold?

1702
01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:09.515
No, no. There's nothing like New York air.

1703
01:38:09.882 --> 01:38:11.805
Look, there it goes.

1704
01:38:17.014 --> 01:38:19.016
I made so many mistakes.

1705
01:38:23.187 --> 01:38:25.030
You weren't one of them.

1706
01:38:31.696 --> 01:38:34.245
Okay, folks, let's start the countdown.

1707
01:38:34.407 --> 01:38:36.034
Ten.

1708
01:38:37.368 --> 01:38:39.041
Nine.

1709
01:38:40.204 --> 01:38:41.956
Eight.

1710
01:38:42.957 --> 01:38:44.459
Seven.

1711
01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:47.378
Six.

1712
01:38:48.588 --> 01:38:49.885
Five.

1713
01:38:51.174 --> 01:38:52.721
Four.

1714
01:38:54.051 --> 01:38:55.678
Three.

1715
01:38:56.804 --> 01:38:58.351
Two.

1716
01:38:59.515 --> 01:39:00.562
One.

1717
01:39:00.725 --> 01:39:03.069
Happy New Year!

1718
01:39:26.834 --> 01:39:28.131
Wait.

1719
01:39:28.294 --> 01:39:30.262
If you're here, who's at Times Square?

1720
01:39:35.384 --> 01:39:40.481
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1721
01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.612
And never brought to mind?

1722
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:51.777
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1723
01:39:51.943 --> 01:39:56.449
And auld fang syne?

1724
01:40:00.284 --> 01:40:05.791
And surely you will buy your cup

1725
01:40:05.957 --> 01:40:10.633
And surely I'll buy mine

1726
01:40:10.795 --> 01:40:14.299
And we'll take a cup of kindness yet

1727
01:40:14.465 --> 01:40:16.342
- You seen Hailey anywhere?
- I haven't.


1728
01:40:16.509 --> 01:40:19.103
I was looking for her and I haven't-
- Mm.

1729
01:40:19.262 --> 01:40:21.890
For auld fang syne

1730
01:40:22.139 --> 01:40:27.396
We two have run about the slopes

1731
01:40:27.562 --> 01:40:32.989
And picked the daisies fine

1732
01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:38.657
But we've wandered many a weary foot

1733
01:40:38.823 --> 01:40:44.205
Since auld fang syne

1734
01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:49.877
For auld lang syne, my dear

1735
01:40:50.042 --> 01:40:55.424
For auld fang syne

1736
01:40:55.590 --> 01:41:01.017
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

1737
01:41:01.178 --> 01:41:06.810
For auld fang syne

1738
01:41:09.979 --> 01:41:12.903
They're calling me now. We have
to go. But I love you so much.


1739
01:41:13.065 --> 01:41:15.193
I think about you all the time.

1740
01:41:15.359 --> 01:41:16.406
I love you.

1741
01:41:18.112 --> 01:41:19.614
I love you so much.

1742
01:41:26.954 --> 01:41:32.552
We two have paddled in the stream

1743
01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:36.931
From morning sun till night

1744
01:41:37.089 --> 01:41:42.971
But the seas between us broad have roared

1745
01:41:43.137 --> 01:41:47.233
From auld fang syne

1746
01:41:48.392 --> 01:41:49.564
For auld fang syne

1747
01:41:49.727 --> 01:41:51.570
What the hell are you doing?

1748
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:53.572
I'm twice your age!

1749
01:41:54.732 --> 01:41:56.279
Final resolution.

1750
01:41:56.776 --> 01:42:00.747
Midnight kiss on New Year's
Eve. Boom! Check it off.

1751
01:42:00.905 --> 01:42:05.706
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

1752
01:42:05.868 --> 01:42:13.047
For auld fang syne

1753
01:42:28.432 --> 01:42:34.064
Start spreading the news I'm leaving today

1754
01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:35.607
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You're sure?


1755
01:42:35.773 --> 01:42:36.945
I'm sure.

1756
01:42:37.191 --> 01:42:38.943
You have no idea how worried I was.

1757
01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:40.657
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

1758
01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:43.118
- Hailey.
- Hi, Piper.


1759
01:42:43.406 --> 01:42:46.159
- Where have you been?
- You totally freaked us all out.


1760
01:42:46.325 --> 01:42:48.794
We got passes to the
afterparty at the Hard Rock.

1761
01:42:48.953 --> 01:42:53.299
And Piper's mom, who's been following
us all night, is gonna take us all home.


1762
01:42:56.961 --> 01:43:01.307
Can I go, Mom? 
Please, please, please.

1763
01:43:01.465 --> 01:43:02.933
- Go. Go. Have fun.
- Really?


1764
01:43:03.092 --> 01:43:05.345
- Yes. Have fun. Yes, really.
- For real? Thank you.


1765
01:43:05.511 --> 01:43:07.354
- Do you wanna come with us?
- No.


1766
01:43:07.513 --> 01:43:09.481
- I'll pass. I'm good.
- Are you sure?


1767
01:43:10.015 --> 01:43:11.517
You should go to your party.

1768
01:43:14.145 --> 01:43:16.819
I love you, Mom. Really.

1769
01:43:17.565 --> 01:43:18.817
I love you too.

1770
01:43:21.152 --> 01:43:22.369
But you're still grounded.

1771
01:43:22.695 --> 01:43:23.867
Yeah, I figured.

1772
01:43:24.947 --> 01:43:27.200
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.


1773
01:43:29.243 --> 01:43:31.837
Happy New Year, bro. Take care.

1774
01:43:31.996 --> 01:43:34.419
All right. Talk to you later, man.

1775
01:43:34.582 --> 01:43:37.461
Text me when you get home
that you got home all right.


1776
01:43:38.586 --> 01:43:41.339
Bye! Happy New Year!

1777
01:43:49.388 --> 01:43:53.393
- Hey, Kim, you came for the party.
- Oh, no, I'm just picking something up.


1778
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.858
Hey. You made it.

1779
01:43:57.021 --> 01:44:01.618
Whatever. You know, 
I saw you kissing Lily Bowman.

1780
01:44:01.776 --> 01:44:03.198
Busted.

1781
01:44:04.028 --> 01:44:05.871
Can we talk somewhere else?

1782
01:44:10.785 --> 01:44:11.911
Come here.

1783
01:44:13.871 --> 01:44:15.373
Look, I'm--

1784
01:44:15.706 --> 01:44:17.049
Hello.

1785
01:44:17.875 --> 01:44:21.470
I'm telling you the truth. She grabbed
me and she totally stole it from me.


1786
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:25.634
Oh, she stole it. Oh, okay, yeah.
That makes just perfect sense.


1787
01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.394
Well, look, I was just
watching the ball drop and then--

1788
01:44:36.685 --> 01:44:38.028
Whoa.

1789
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:39.902
Aw...

1790
01:44:42.233 --> 01:44:43.576
Who is that?!

1791
01:45:12.096 --> 01:45:15.191
Would you like to see what
we do on New Year's Eve?

1792
01:45:19.603 --> 01:45:20.775
Welcome to the world.

1793
01:45:40.207 --> 01:45:41.709
- Hi.
- Hey.


1794
01:45:42.793 --> 01:45:44.636
So you had your baby.

1795
01:45:45.212 --> 01:45:46.714
Congratulations.

1796
01:45:47.798 --> 01:45:49.641
- Boy or a girl?
- A boy.


1797
01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.222
A boy.

1798
01:45:51.385 --> 01:45:53.683
- You?
- Girl. Third one.


1799
01:45:56.307 --> 01:45:57.684
Exactly at 12:04.

1800
01:46:00.895 --> 01:46:02.147
And yours was when?

1801
01:46:07.443 --> 01:46:08.490
12:05.

1802
01:46:09.403 --> 01:46:10.700
- Really?
- Yeah.


1803
01:46:12.615 --> 01:46:15.835
Thank you. Thanks so much.

1804
01:46:17.411 --> 01:46:19.334
12:05 it is, then.

1805
01:46:38.557 --> 01:46:41.231
- Hey. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.


1806
01:46:41.769 --> 01:46:45.899
It's a very good job. 
They asked us back for next year.

1807
01:47:16.762 --> 01:47:18.389
You showed up.

1808
01:47:18.889 --> 01:47:20.391
You showed up.

1809
01:47:22.768 --> 01:47:24.190
You look beautiful.

1810
01:47:24.561 --> 01:47:27.735
Well, I had a year to get ready.

1811
01:47:41.787 --> 01:47:46.167
Sometimes it feels like there are so many
things in this world we can't control:


1812
01:47:46.333 --> 01:47:50.338
Earthquakes, floods, reality shows.

1813
01:47:50.504 --> 01:47:53.758
But it's important to remember
the things that we can...


1814
01:47:53.924 --> 01:47:58.851
...like forgiveness, second chances, fresh starts.

1815
01:47:59.096 --> 01:48:03.567
Because the one thing that turns the world
from a lonely place to a beautiful place...


1816
01:48:03.726 --> 01:48:05.444
...is love.

1817
01:48:05.602 --> 01:48:08.276
Love in any of its forms.

1818
01:48:08.439 --> 01:48:10.282
Love gives us hope.

1819
01:48:10.441 --> 01:48:12.443
Hope for the new year.

1820
01:48:12.985 --> 01:48:15.283
That's New Year's Eve to me:

1821
01:48:15.446 --> 01:48:16.618
Hope...

1822
01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:18.657
...and a great party.

1823
01:48:58.322 --> 01:49:01.701
Don't just dump them! 
It should be magical!

1824
01:49:01.992 --> 01:49:03.835
Take one.

1825
01:49:14.588 --> 01:49:16.716
I've been plotting that slap for years.

1826
01:49:16.882 --> 01:49:21.103
How I would just walk up
to you out of the blue... Shit.

1827
01:49:32.564 --> 01:49:34.032
I wouldn't want you to be my doctor.

1828
01:49:51.333 --> 01:49:52.380
You think we should...

1829
01:49:54.336 --> 01:49:57.055
You think we should move him to hospice?

1830
01:49:57.214 --> 01:50:00.468
- Why did you do that to me?
- It's okay, Nurse Aimee.


1831
01:50:04.138 --> 01:50:06.106
- Good one.
- Yeah, good one.


1832
01:50:06.265 --> 01:50:07.391
Cut, cut, cut.

1833
01:50:07.558 --> 01:50:10.903
L... up. I didn't tell her
in the middle of her sentence.

1834
01:50:11.061 --> 01:50:12.779
Go to mark.

1835
01:50:20.946 --> 01:50:22.914
Oh, hey. Hold the elevator.

1836
01:50:24.741 --> 01:50:26.914
Baby, things were just heating up!

1837
01:50:36.712 --> 01:50:39.181
Oh. Mrs. Baxter.

1838
01:50:39.381 --> 01:50:40.678
I mean, Mrs.--

1839
01:50:40.883 --> 01:50:42.760
What's your name? Ms. Withers.

1840
01:50:42.926 --> 01:50:47.557
It's midnight. We have to do something
tonight. Get over yourself. Shi-- Uh-uh.


1841
01:50:48.432 --> 01:50:51.231
Ooh. Sorry, you're a little late.

1842
01:51:20.464 --> 01:51:23.638
He was in this morning. 
He didn't leave orders, and--

1843
01:51:25.677 --> 01:51:29.932
And I may not allow
him in my unit anymore.

1844
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:45.323
Something coming.

1845
01:51:45.489 --> 01:51:47.958
Oh, something coming.

1846
01:51:48.367 --> 01:51:49.835
Oh.

1847
01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.662
Oh, what do we have here?

1848
01:51:52.162 --> 01:51:54.164
- I think we have twins.
- Oh, my God!


1849
01:51:54.331 --> 01:51:56.709
Oh, you are a goddess.

1850
01:52:29.366 --> 01:52:31.039
That is a wrap!
