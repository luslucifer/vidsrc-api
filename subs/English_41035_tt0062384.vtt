1
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.590
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's more
than an entertainment. It's a panacea.


2
00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:04.141
Well, a tonic.
That's it, ladies and gents.


3
00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:07.561
A tonic for jangled nerves
and tired blood.


4
00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.891
There's nothing like a good fright
for toning up the circulation.


5
00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:13.936
And that's what you've got in here.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's in here.


6
00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:16.980
You'll shriek, you'll shudder,
you'll shiver,


7
00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:19.069
but it's all in fun
and no harm done.


8
00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:21.859
So come along, ladies and gents,
get your tickets now.


9
00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:24.074
Only half a crown. Half a crown!

10
00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:28.161
For the greatest thrill
you've ever had in your life.


11
00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:43.006
<i>Come along to
the Torture Garden of Dr Diabolo.</i>


12
00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:49.020
<i>Dr Diabolo's Torture Garden.</i>

13
00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.258
Yes, my friends. 
There is no end

14
00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:26.345
to man's inhumanity to man.

15
00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:27.975
You have seen torture.

16
00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:32.601
Now I'm going to show you death.

17
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.527
The electric chair.

18
00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.525
It's used

19
00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:50.657
for the execution of condemned
criminals in the United States.


20
00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.795
The man in that chair has
committed a crime. It's murder.


21
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:57.213
He's gonna pay for it.

22
00:03:57.924 --> 00:04:00.211
Strapped and helpless
in that little chair,


23
00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:03.465
the creature awaits his doom.

24
00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:08.342
Perhaps you feel sympathy,
compassion for him, eh?


25
00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.552
Well, not me.

26
00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:12.516
Not me,

27
00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.181
for reasons of my own.

28
00:04:16.067 --> 00:04:19.651
And soon, thousands of volts
of electricity


29
00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:21.938
will sear every nerve

30
00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:24.983
and every cell of his body.

31
00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:28.445
A very civilised method of revenge,

32
00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:30.784
that I approve of.

33
00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:33.540
You'll notice the bits of sponge
here and there,


34
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.327
where the electrodes
touch the flesh.


35
00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:38.667
That is to prevent the gentleman

36
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.800
from being burnt to a cinder
before your eyes. But, nevertheless,


37
00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.211
he will burn inside.

38
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:47.047
Inside.

39
00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:49.674
Inside.

40
00:04:50.143 --> 00:04:52.135
Inside.

41
00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:56.310
You picture yourself in his place.

42
00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:58.891
Yes, try that.

43
00:04:59.694 --> 00:05:02.732
Now, in his final moment,

44
00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:06.358
his last breath,

45
00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:10.449
his last sweet second of life.

46
00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:12.489
And now, my friend,

47
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:16.080
in full payment
for what has passed,


48
00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:18.461
I am going to pull the switch.

49
00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:52.946
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
concludes our regular performance.


50
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.786
But wait.

51
00:05:57.168 --> 00:05:58.955
There's more to come.

52
00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:00.502
Oh, yes.

53
00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:03.210
What you have seen

54
00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.462
are imaginary horrors.

55
00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:11.638
But now,

56
00:06:11.808 --> 00:06:14.892
I can let you experience
real ones.


57
00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:19.810
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
I do have a private exhibit.


58
00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:23.897
It is for the true connoisseurs.

59
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.939
Right behind the curtain there
you will find


60
00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:30.362
the real Torture Garden.

61
00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:33.653
It is not for the faint of heart.

62
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.289
For what you find there will be
more terrifying, more horrendous,


63
00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:39.329
than your deepest,
darkest dreams.


64
00:06:39.544 --> 00:06:42.002
Now, then,
who has the courage to try it?


65
00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:47.713
- How much does it cost?
- Well, since this exhibit


66
00:06:47.928 --> 00:06:50.921
is limited to a special few,
five pounds.


67
00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.758
- Five pounds? You got a nerve.
- And what about you?


68
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:59.221
Have you the nerve to face the thing
that lies waiting inside there, eh?


69
00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:01.476
It's a thrill of a lifetime,
I guarantee it.


70
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.610
If you don't agree with me afterwards,
I'll cheerfully refund your money.


71
00:07:06.154 --> 00:07:08.271
Well, come on.
Are you all cowards?


72
00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:11.236
It is a lot of money,

73
00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:13.488
but I'd like to see.

74
00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:15.949
What about you, mate?

75
00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:18.243
I think he's a fake.

76
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:21.033
Still, let's have a go.

77
00:07:26.508 --> 00:07:27.919
One moment.

78
00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.549
There are others here who may find
this exhibit of special interest.


79
00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:34.050
These two ladies.

80
00:07:37.894 --> 00:07:40.136
Come on, I dare you.

81
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.148
Yes, thank you.
Now step right inside, if you don't mind.


82
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:52.406
Don't be afraid.
I'll join you in a moment.


83
00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:57.494
Is this all there is?

84
00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.783
- It's not much to look at, is it?
- Not for a fiver, it isn't.


85
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.702
- You're American, aren't you?
- Yes.


86
00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:06.458
- Where you from?
- Hollywood.


87
00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:09.465
- You in films?
- Yes, my cousin's visiting me on holiday.


88
00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:12.589
I'm afraid she must
find it rather dull here.


89
00:08:13.805 --> 00:08:15.546
Yes or no?

90
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:30.736
Where is he?

91
00:09:06.357 --> 00:09:07.814
Oh, it's just a waxworks.

92
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.272
A dummy?

93
00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:13.695
- If you ask me, we're the dummies.
- It isn't quite what I expected.


94
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.074
- What did you expect?
- Well, I don't know, but...


95
00:09:17.952 --> 00:09:19.864
Where is he, this...?
What's he call himself?


96
00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.739
Diabolo. You call me?

97
00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:26.917
- Who's your friend?
- That's a good question.


98
00:09:27.003 --> 00:09:29.416
This is a figure from ancient legend.

99
00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:32.340
Atropos, Goddess of Destiny.

100
00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:36.506
In the left hand, the skein of life.
In the right, the shears of fate.


101
00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:39.384
Each coloured thread
represents a human life.


102
00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:43.184
And the shears
have the power to cut it short.


103
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:44.931
Oh, come on.

104
00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:48.143
It's just one of those mechanical figures
that tells your fortune for a penny.


105
00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:50.395
Yes, she can tell your fortune,
of course.


106
00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:52.522
That's the least of it. No, no, no.

107
00:09:52.612 --> 00:09:57.607
See, I promised you horror.
And I intend to keep that promise.


108
00:09:57.742 --> 00:10:00.860
This sibyl here
has a very strange magic,


109
00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:04.830
a very strange power.
For she is able to reveal


110
00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:09.039
to each and every one of you
the ultimate horror.


111
00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.169
Which is, of course,

112
00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:15.500
the horror that you have
hidden away inside yourself.


113
00:10:15.677 --> 00:10:18.169
The secret, in fact,

114
00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:20.008
of your own evil.

115
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:23.674
A very old-fashioned word
nowadays, "evil".


116
00:10:23.852 --> 00:10:25.309
You'd prefer I say:

117
00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:30.849
"The primordial monstrosities that
lurk beneath the surface of the mind."


118
00:10:30.984 --> 00:10:33.567
But I prefer "evil".

119
00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:35.186
Just a minute.

120
00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:38.777
- Is this all you've got to show us?
- No, there is this also.


121
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.819
That if you can gain a knowledge
of your inner evil,


122
00:10:43.037 --> 00:10:47.407
why, then you will have been
forewarned, and perhaps,


123
00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:49.325
that is, perhaps,

124
00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:52.040
you can escape the monstrous act

125
00:10:52.213 --> 00:10:54.125
and the hideous consequences.

126
00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:58.922
Are you trying to tell us that this
thing can really foretell the future?


127
00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:01.712
I'm simply trying to say
that what she foretells


128
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.303
need not come to pass.

129
00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:06.972
Not if you heed what you've learned.

130
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:11.305
Not if you shun the evil
that lies deep in your nature.


131
00:11:11.524 --> 00:11:13.641
I didn't pay five pounds to
listen to you preach a sermon.


132
00:11:13.818 --> 00:11:17.232
- I think you've lost your money, friend.
- Come here, young man.


133
00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:19.946
Come here.

134
00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:22.024
What, are you afraid?

135
00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:29.077
You seem to doubt my word.

136
00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:32.122
How would you like
to be the first to learn


137
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:34.207
what fate has in store for you?

138
00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:36.251
What do I do, ask it questions?

139
00:11:36.591 --> 00:11:39.504
That won't be necessary.
Just stand where you are.


140
00:11:39.928 --> 00:11:41.885
The figure will communicate
with you.


141
00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:45.472
- How?
- Through your mind.


142
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.309
Just look at the figure.
Look at the figure.


143
00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:53.514
It can't hurt you.
Now look at the shears.


144
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.393
Look deeply. Deeply, deeply.

145
00:11:57.654 --> 00:12:00.863
Deeply, deeply,

146
00:12:01.032 --> 00:12:04.616
into the shears of fate.

147
00:12:47.078 --> 00:12:50.037
- Hello, I'm Colin Williams.
- I'm Nurse Parker.


148
00:12:50.123 --> 00:12:52.957
Yes, your uncle said
you might be coming for a visit.


149
00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:55.705
- How is he?
- His heart is very weak.


150
00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:57.627
The doctor says it could be
any time now.


151
00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:00.460
- I'll try not to tire him.
- Good.


152
00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:02.208
I'll be off.
Oh, if there's any change,


153
00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:04.627
get in touch with Dr Silversmith
in the village. All right?


154
00:13:04.846 --> 00:13:07.759
- I will. Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


155
00:13:09.642 --> 00:13:13.431
Well, Colin, it's been a long time.

156
00:13:15.898 --> 00:13:19.858
- Yes. Three years, isn't it?
- It must be all of that.


157
00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:22.022
You're looking fit.

158
00:13:22.196 --> 00:13:25.985
- And you.
- My time on earth is short, and


159
00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:31.032
- since you're my sole living relative...
- Yes, I realise that.


160
00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:34.281
- And frankly, I'm very grateful.
- Are you, now?


161
00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:36.993
Yeah. It just so happens that

162
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.287
right now I'm in a bit
of a fix, financially.


163
00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:42.839
I didn't invite you here
to discuss money.


164
00:13:44.135 --> 00:13:45.967
Sit down.

165
00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:47.920
- Here, let me...
- No.


166
00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:50.472
What I have to say is

167
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.717
of far greater importance.

168
00:13:54.562 --> 00:13:58.522
This may be the last time
we shall ever meet.


169
00:13:58.608 --> 00:14:03.728
Once and for all, I want to urge
you again to mend your ways.


170
00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:06.571
You can't expect
to go on like this forever.


171
00:14:06.657 --> 00:14:12.369
You must find a job, settle down,
make something of your life.


172
00:14:13.664 --> 00:14:18.159
If you could only understand this,
if you could see the light,


173
00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:22.212
that would be the greatest legacy
I could give you.


174
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.752
You're absolutely right.

175
00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:27.751
These last three years
haven't been easy.


176
00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:31.513
Believe me, I've learned my lesson.

177
00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:33.928
Good.

178
00:14:35.103 --> 00:14:38.437
- You have a job?
- I've got one promised,


179
00:14:38.648 --> 00:14:41.356
as soon as I've cleared up
my obligations.


180
00:14:41.818 --> 00:14:44.185
Oh, it's not all that bad,
it's just a matter of a


181
00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:46.103
few thousand pounds.

182
00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:48.822
Out of the question,
absolutely out of the question.


183
00:14:48.908 --> 00:14:50.865
- Uncle Roger.
- I don't have the money.


184
00:14:52.286 --> 00:14:54.573
And what about your fortune?
My inheritance.


185
00:14:55.289 --> 00:14:58.578
- There is no fortune.
- Rubbish!


186
00:14:59.335 --> 00:15:01.418
Everyone knows you've got money.

187
00:15:01.921 --> 00:15:03.913
You've lived here
on your own, what?


188
00:15:04.382 --> 00:15:05.918
Thirty years?

189
00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.338
You've never worked.

190
00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:11.503
- How do you pay for it all?
- That's none of your business.


191
00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:14.347
That's where you're wrong.
It is my business.


192
00:15:15.017 --> 00:15:17.304
I've been asking questions.

193
00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:20.809
They say in the village that
everything you buy is paid for in cash.


194
00:15:20.898 --> 00:15:23.436
No, no, not just ordinary cash.

195
00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:27.486
But coins. Old gold coins.

196
00:15:27.572 --> 00:15:30.690
Please, I don't want to talk about it.

197
00:15:30.783 --> 00:15:32.445
All right.

198
00:15:32.702 --> 00:15:34.739
We'll talk about something else.

199
00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:38.701
This cottage, for instance.

200
00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:40.783
Very old, isn't it?

201
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.168
They say in the village
it was deserted for years,


202
00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:45.621
before you moved in
and renovated it.


203
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.672
There's talk about it
belonging to a witch.


204
00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:50.216
- Local gossip, superstition.
- Is it?


205
00:15:50.303 --> 00:15:52.966
Surely you don't believe
in witchcraft.


206
00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:57.425
This cottage was owned by
a harmless old woman, an eccentric.


207
00:15:57.518 --> 00:16:00.101
You mean a miser, don't you?

208
00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:04.353
A miser with a hidden hoard of gold.
And you discovered it.


209
00:16:04.442 --> 00:16:06.525
- That's the truth!
- Stop.


210
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:08.978
Can't you see
what you're doing to me?


211
00:16:09.155 --> 00:16:11.112
- Let me alone.
- Not until you tell me


212
00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:12.773
where that money's hidden.

213
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.119
Colin, my medicine.

214
00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:24.000
There, on the mantelpiece.

215
00:16:24.086 --> 00:16:25.793
Quickly.

216
00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:29.415
Half a glass.

217
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:31.171
Hurry.

218
00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:52.400
- The money.
- Please.


219
00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:54.197
I'll tell you later.

220
00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:04.249
Now!

221
00:17:06.504 --> 00:17:08.245
Colin.

222
00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.376
Oh, God.

223
00:17:23.688 --> 00:17:25.224
Damn.

224
00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:48.624
I was handing him his medicine
when he had this final spasm.


225
00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:52.047
They go like that sometimes.
One's seen it before.


226
00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:55.126
Seven o'clock, you said?

227
00:17:56.012 --> 00:17:58.049
What? Oh, about that.

228
00:17:58.139 --> 00:18:00.597
I really didn't check the exact time.

229
00:18:00.766 --> 00:18:04.760
Oh, seven's near enough.
It's just a formality for the record.


230
00:18:05.021 --> 00:18:07.229
I'll complete this in the morning.

231
00:18:07.315 --> 00:18:09.272
Oh, thank you, doctor.

232
00:18:09.442 --> 00:18:12.935
- You're stopping for the funeral, I take it?
- Certainly.


233
00:18:13.404 --> 00:18:16.738
You don't mind spending the night
here alone?


234
00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:19.441
No. No, of course not.

235
00:18:22.913 --> 00:18:25.656
Well, look after yourself.

236
00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:12.455
Yes.

237
00:23:10.784 --> 00:23:12.320
Yes.

238
00:23:12.703 --> 00:23:14.569
I can hear you.

239
00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:19.832
Your name

240
00:23:21.211 --> 00:23:24.045
is Balthazar.

241
00:23:25.633 --> 00:23:28.717
You've come to stay with me.

242
00:23:29.136 --> 00:23:31.549
To serve me,

243
00:23:33.015 --> 00:23:35.632
as you served my uncle.

244
00:23:38.604 --> 00:23:40.971
You will

245
00:23:41.148 --> 00:23:43.105
reward me

246
00:23:43.984 --> 00:23:46.397
as you rewarded him

247
00:23:48.572 --> 00:23:50.564
in return

248
00:23:51.158 --> 00:23:54.196
for things I must do for you.

249
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.657
My uncle

250
00:23:57.665 --> 00:24:00.078
was ungrateful.

251
00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:04.498
He buried

252
00:24:04.672 --> 00:24:08.336
you away in the darkness.

253
00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:11.960
But now you are free,

254
00:24:14.723 --> 00:24:16.635
and hungry.

255
00:24:21.355 --> 00:24:23.096
Hungry.

256
00:25:40.934 --> 00:25:41.674
No.

257
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.970
No!

258
00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:19.261
Dream.

259
00:27:39.136 --> 00:27:40.627
<i>You've come</i>

260
00:27:40.846 --> 00:27:42.553
<i>to stay with me,</i>

261
00:27:42.723 --> 00:27:44.214
<i>serve me,</i>

262
00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:46.178
<i>as you served my uncle.</i>

263
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.643
<i>You will reward me</i>

264
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.762
<i>as you rewarded him.</i>

265
00:30:22.716 --> 00:30:23.456
No.

266
00:30:24.885 --> 00:30:26.626
No, not her.

267
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:37.725
All right, I'll do it. I'll do it.

268
00:31:19.147 --> 00:31:21.059
<i>Mr Williams?</i>

269
00:31:22.734 --> 00:31:24.441
<i>Mr Williams.</i>

270
00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:41.414
Mr Williams. Mr Williams.

271
00:31:42.337 --> 00:31:46.547
There's... there's a man
out there with his head all...


272
00:31:51.346 --> 00:31:52.177
No! No!

273
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:31.667
Good evening, sir.

274
00:32:37.476 --> 00:32:40.435
Not leaving us now, are you, sir?

275
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.307
I've got my living to earn, you know.

276
00:32:42.481 --> 00:32:45.849
Well, I won't keep you. But I thought you
might be able to give me information.


277
00:32:46.234 --> 00:32:48.897
There's been some talk of a tramp
reported in this area.


278
00:32:48.987 --> 00:32:51.980
Harmless old chap apparently,
but we're on the lookout for him.


279
00:32:52.157 --> 00:32:53.989
You don't happen
to have seen him, have you, sir?


280
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:56.614
No. I've seen no one all day.

281
00:32:56.786 --> 00:32:59.153
Now, if you'll excuse me.

282
00:32:59.372 --> 00:33:02.615
Oh, let me give you
a hand with this, sir.


283
00:33:15.514 --> 00:33:17.722
Why did you do it, Colin?

284
00:33:21.853 --> 00:33:23.970
What made you kill them?

285
00:33:24.564 --> 00:33:27.898
- Balthazar.
- Balthazar? Who's he?


286
00:33:29.277 --> 00:33:30.813
I don't know.

287
00:33:32.197 --> 00:33:34.735
He takes the form of a cat.

288
00:33:35.367 --> 00:33:38.576
But he's not a cat. 
He's inside me.

289
00:33:39.037 --> 00:33:42.075
He's in... he's inside my head.

290
00:33:42.249 --> 00:33:45.333
I see. He's inside your head.

291
00:33:45.418 --> 00:33:49.082
Oh, yeah. I know how it sounds.

292
00:33:49.756 --> 00:33:51.418
But it's true.

293
00:33:52.842 --> 00:33:55.175
Balthazar is real.

294
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.757
How long has he been with you?

295
00:33:57.931 --> 00:33:59.968
Since last night,

296
00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:02.508
when I found a skeleton
in the cellar.


297
00:34:02.686 --> 00:34:06.145
- In your uncle's house?
- The witch's house.


298
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:10.271
Don't you see? Balthazar must
have been the witch's familiar spirit.


299
00:34:11.027 --> 00:34:15.192
He made my uncle rich
with the witch's gold.


300
00:34:16.032 --> 00:34:19.571
In return for murdering, huh?

301
00:34:19.786 --> 00:34:22.950
But my uncle tricked him.

302
00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:26.199
He buried him away
in the darkness.


303
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:30.124
Balthazar said he was ungrateful.

304
00:34:31.298 --> 00:34:32.880
Anyway,

305
00:34:33.133 --> 00:34:34.840
I freed him.

306
00:34:35.635 --> 00:34:37.217
And then he...

307
00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.389
He wanted to have
the same agreement with me.


308
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.967
Now, you don't know
what it's like, doctor


309
00:34:45.145 --> 00:34:47.262
to have a creature

310
00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:49.556
whispering inside your head,

311
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.766
giving you commands.

312
00:34:52.193 --> 00:34:54.105
And you've got to obey.

313
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:57.563
You've got to obey or...

314
00:34:59.034 --> 00:35:00.570
Or he starts

315
00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:04.658
scratching and clawing inside.

316
00:35:05.999 --> 00:35:09.743
He forced me to kill the tramp
and Nurse Parker.


317
00:35:10.378 --> 00:35:12.290
We found the bodies in your trunk.

318
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.214
But there's one more thing
you must tell us, Colin.


319
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.462
What happened to their heads?

320
00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:20.470
- Why did you...?
- Not me.


321
00:35:20.805 --> 00:35:22.762
Balthazar.

322
00:35:23.183 --> 00:35:26.301
That's what he feeds on
when he's hungry.


323
00:35:27.437 --> 00:35:29.599
You mustn't let him
come back to me.


324
00:35:29.689 --> 00:35:31.806
- Please don't go.
- I'll be back in the morning.


325
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.608
No, you can't leave me
here alone, not all night.


326
00:35:34.778 --> 00:35:37.361
Balthazar will be hungry again,
and if he isn't fed...


327
00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:40.903
Don't you understand?
He'll be hungry.


328
00:35:40.992 --> 00:35:42.699
Come back!

329
00:35:42.994 --> 00:35:46.032
Come back! Please.

330
00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:49.282
Please don't leave me!

331
00:36:08.186 --> 00:36:09.802
Let me out!

332
00:36:09.896 --> 00:36:13.105
Get me away from him!
Get me away from him!


333
00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:16.309
Let me out! He's here! He's hungry!

334
00:36:16.403 --> 00:36:19.191
- Now, what's your problem?
- Look.


335
00:36:21.449 --> 00:36:25.489
There's nothing there. Now you
calm down and get some sleep.


336
00:36:25.578 --> 00:36:27.444
No, don't go away.

337
00:36:27.539 --> 00:36:30.327
He'll come back for me!

338
00:36:30.417 --> 00:36:32.409
He'll come back!

339
00:36:32.544 --> 00:36:36.379
<i>Don't let it get at me! Help!</i>

340
00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:21.423
Are you all right?

341
00:37:22.761 --> 00:37:24.093
You seemed to be in a trance.

342
00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:27.593
Just standing there
and staring into space for a minute.


343
00:37:29.225 --> 00:37:30.932
Only a minute?

344
00:37:31.644 --> 00:37:34.102
It seemed like days.

345
00:37:36.149 --> 00:37:37.640
I can't explain.

346
00:37:37.984 --> 00:37:39.566
I can.

347
00:37:40.278 --> 00:37:41.314
There is a theory.

348
00:37:41.488 --> 00:37:45.573
The past, the present and the future
are merely different aspects


349
00:37:45.742 --> 00:37:47.904
of the same moment
in time and space.


350
00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:50.577
Do you understand that theory?

351
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.118
Then perhaps you can understand
that since a drowning man


352
00:37:54.292 --> 00:37:57.706
can view his entire past
in a few seconds


353
00:37:57.879 --> 00:38:00.246
he can also view his future

354
00:38:00.423 --> 00:38:02.631
by the same rule.

355
00:38:02.842 --> 00:38:05.084
Particularly if he's hypnotised, hmm?

356
00:38:05.261 --> 00:38:08.299
That's all it was. Hypnosis.
It's a trick.


357
00:38:08.473 --> 00:38:10.055
- No trick.
- What, then?


358
00:38:10.225 --> 00:38:11.682
A warning.

359
00:38:11.768 --> 00:38:15.057
What exactly did you see?

360
00:38:16.481 --> 00:38:18.222
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Well,


361
00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:20.979
was there anything about it
that was true?


362
00:38:22.654 --> 00:38:26.398
It's true I have an uncle
who lives in the country.


363
00:38:26.699 --> 00:38:30.409
And I was going
to see him to ask...

364
00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.287
- But how did you know?
- I never saw you before.


365
00:38:34.374 --> 00:38:37.082
I know nothing about you.
You are merely a customer.


366
00:38:37.418 --> 00:38:39.125
Who comes next?

367
00:38:39.754 --> 00:38:43.498
Who is the next to meet Atropos,
the Goddess of Destiny?


368
00:38:43.591 --> 00:38:45.833
What about you, young lady?

369
00:38:46.594 --> 00:38:48.631
Surely an innocent young woman
like yourself


370
00:38:48.805 --> 00:38:52.139
has no deep, dark secrets
in her mind.


371
00:38:53.852 --> 00:38:57.892
Why don't you? After all,
it was your idea to come in here.


372
00:39:06.322 --> 00:39:10.407
It will show you nothing
but what is in your own heart.


373
00:39:11.077 --> 00:39:12.693
Now,

374
00:39:14.122 --> 00:39:15.954
look at the shears.

375
00:39:16.082 --> 00:39:17.618
Look closely at the shears.

376
00:39:17.709 --> 00:39:20.417
Your eyes are fixed on the shears,
they can't look away.


377
00:39:20.962 --> 00:39:23.750
Look deeply, deeply, deeply.

378
00:39:23.923 --> 00:39:27.507
Deeply into the shears of fate.

379
00:39:40.064 --> 00:39:42.397
- What time is it?
- Seven-twenty.


380
00:39:42.567 --> 00:39:46.231
Oh, no. He'll be here in ten minutes.
I'll never get this done in time.


381
00:39:47.196 --> 00:39:49.028
So let him wait a while.

382
00:39:49.115 --> 00:39:51.072
- Who is it?
- Mike Charles.


383
00:39:51.993 --> 00:39:54.155
And he's not the kind
you keep waiting.


384
00:39:54.287 --> 00:39:55.994
This dinner date
could be important.


385
00:39:56.706 --> 00:39:57.947
You know what it can mean.

386
00:39:58.041 --> 00:40:01.125
Going to the right places,
meeting the right people.


387
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.829
I know. It's the only way
for a girl to get ahead in this town.


388
00:40:05.757 --> 00:40:10.127
Look at these wrinkles.
And I haven't even had my shower yet!


389
00:40:11.554 --> 00:40:13.671
Go on, go take your shower.
Let me iron the dress.


390
00:40:13.765 --> 00:40:17.099
Oh, would you?
Carla, gee, thanks. You're an angel.


391
00:40:17.393 --> 00:40:19.885
What are roommates for?

392
00:41:10.238 --> 00:41:13.026
- Finished?
- Oh, Millie, it's that darned material.


393
00:41:13.157 --> 00:41:15.240
The iron was too hot.

394
00:41:15.326 --> 00:41:17.443
- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry, Millie.


395
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.532
- No!
- You can wear something else, maybe.


396
00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:21.789
You know I haven't got
any wardrobe.


397
00:41:21.916 --> 00:41:25.125
I went without lunches
a whole month to buy this dress.


398
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:28.079
I'd let you have one of mine,
only I've only got one good one.


399
00:41:28.297 --> 00:41:29.754
And I'm wearing that tonight.

400
00:41:29.966 --> 00:41:32.925
Oh, no, he's here.
Oh, Carla, please do something.


401
00:41:33.011 --> 00:41:37.381
- Make some excuse.
- Listen, don't worry. I'll handle it.


402
00:41:41.728 --> 00:41:44.311
<i>Hello. I'm Mike Charles.</i>

403
00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:47.519
<i>Hello, I'm Carla Hayes,
Millie's roommate.</i>


404
00:41:47.692 --> 00:41:51.060
<i>- Won't you come in?
- Thanks.</i>


405
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:57.199
- Millie almost ready?
- Millie can't go out tonight.


406
00:41:57.285 --> 00:41:58.947
She's in bed with the flu.

407
00:41:59.078 --> 00:42:02.242
- Well, can I just say hello?
- I don't think you should.


408
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:04.038
That flu's kind of catching.

409
00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:06.705
Yeah, yeah, maybe
I better not go in there.


410
00:42:11.382 --> 00:42:15.592
- Gee, I'm sorry your evening's ruined.
- Yeah, it is kind of rough.


411
00:42:15.678 --> 00:42:17.510
Could have been
a real swinging scene.


412
00:42:17.597 --> 00:42:20.886
- Table for two at Danny's.
- Danny's?


413
00:42:33.029 --> 00:42:37.239
- Like it?
- Love it. All these people.


414
00:42:37.575 --> 00:42:40.067
- Isn't that Bruce Benton over there?
- Where?


415
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:43.780
- At the table in the corner.
- Yeah, and Eddie Storm.


416
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.283
- He's a producer, isn't he?
- The biggest.


417
00:42:47.668 --> 00:42:50.957
Oh, no. Mike Charles, of all people.

418
00:42:51.172 --> 00:42:54.540
With any luck, he'll be too interested
in his new friend to notice us.


419
00:42:54.675 --> 00:42:56.792
Come on, let's say hello.

420
00:43:00.473 --> 00:43:03.682
- Eddie! How's it going?
- Why, Mike.


421
00:43:03.768 --> 00:43:07.728
- Bruce. Mike Charles, remember?
- Yes. Yes, of course.


422
00:43:07.814 --> 00:43:11.273
Oh, Carla Hayes, Eddie Storm.
I guess you know who this is.


423
00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:13.897
- Won't you join us?
- Really, we don't want to intrude.


424
00:43:13.986 --> 00:43:15.272
Oh, go ahead and sit down.

425
00:43:15.363 --> 00:43:17.400
Eddie and I got some business
to talk over.


426
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.654
You go ahead and order.
I'm buying Eddie a little drink.


427
00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:29.701
I can't believe it. Imagine me
having dinner with Bruce Benton.


428
00:43:29.794 --> 00:43:32.582
You know, I've had a thing about you
ever since I was...


429
00:43:32.672 --> 00:43:36.916
Ever since you were a little girl.
Go ahead and say it. I don't mind.


430
00:43:37.009 --> 00:43:39.672
- It just doesn't seem possible.
- What?


431
00:43:39.762 --> 00:43:41.344
Your having dinner with me?

432
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.763
Or because I've been around
so long?


433
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.183
Now you're embarrassing me.

434
00:43:46.477 --> 00:43:48.434
You'll feel better
after you've had a drink.


435
00:43:54.485 --> 00:43:57.853
What's with you? I've been trying to
get you on the phone for two weeks.


436
00:43:57.947 --> 00:44:00.109
I'm lining up production
on his new picture.


437
00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:02.657
- You know how these things are.
- Don't give me that.


438
00:44:02.827 --> 00:44:04.784
You've been freezing me.
Look, I've been knocking around


439
00:44:04.954 --> 00:44:08.493
this industry for 25 years. I figure
I'm entitled to a little consideration.


440
00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.658
I realise that.

441
00:44:10.751 --> 00:44:12.913
You know how important
this business is to me.


442
00:44:13.004 --> 00:44:16.418
- When do I get the word?
- Now, if you like.


443
00:44:16.507 --> 00:44:19.796
Great. Eddie, baby,
I knew you wouldn't let me down.


444
00:44:19.886 --> 00:44:22.503
You talked to them?
Well, what did they say?


445
00:44:22.597 --> 00:44:25.055
- Nothing doing.
- What do you mean, nothing doing?


446
00:44:25.141 --> 00:44:28.350
You know the pictures I've made.
I've got a right to belong.


447
00:44:28.436 --> 00:44:31.474
- You were voted down.
- But I'd do anything, really I would.


448
00:44:31.564 --> 00:44:34.648
- Talk to them again.
- I'm sorry, you know the rules.


449
00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:37.727
Don't take it so hard.
Have another drink.


450
00:44:37.862 --> 00:44:39.569
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry about me.


451
00:44:39.697 --> 00:44:42.986
I'll have another drink, lots of drinks.
And you tell your fink friends from me


452
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:46.160
they don't have to worry about Mike Charles.
He knows how to take care of himself.


453
00:44:46.495 --> 00:44:47.861
But maybe they oughta worry,

454
00:44:48.039 --> 00:44:51.373
because Mike Charles
is just liable to take care of them.


455
00:45:07.683 --> 00:45:11.723
That's wonderful.
Would you really do that for me?


456
00:45:11.896 --> 00:45:15.060
Anybody who knows the titles of all
the pictures I've made since 1950


457
00:45:15.233 --> 00:45:16.644
deserves a break.

458
00:45:16.817 --> 00:45:18.774
Sorry to keep you waiting.

459
00:45:18.945 --> 00:45:21.403
- Where's Mr Charles?
- He asked to be excused.


460
00:45:21.489 --> 00:45:23.856
Another engagement.
I hope you don't mind.


461
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.691
That's quite all right.

462
00:45:25.785 --> 00:45:28.994
Bruce and I were just having
a very interesting discussion.


463
00:45:29.163 --> 00:45:32.156
I was just suggesting to Miss Hayes that
she come down to the studio on Monday


464
00:45:32.375 --> 00:45:34.867
and make a test for that part
we have open.


465
00:45:35.628 --> 00:45:37.369
You mean the sister?

466
00:45:37.463 --> 00:45:39.420
What do you think?

467
00:45:40.132 --> 00:45:43.216
Well, I don't know.
It's the second lead.


468
00:45:43.302 --> 00:45:46.761
- What have you done?
- Television, mostly.


469
00:45:46.847 --> 00:45:50.557
Bruce was just telling me
about the part. It sounds fascinating.


470
00:45:50.643 --> 00:45:51.975
I'm sure I could handle it.

471
00:45:52.311 --> 00:45:54.769
Why don't we shoot some film
and see?


472
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.477
All right, let's do that.

473
00:45:58.609 --> 00:46:02.398
Finks, the whole lot of them. Finks.

474
00:46:04.282 --> 00:46:07.741
You better believe me.
Finks, that's what they are.


475
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:11.529
- Them and their "top ten".
- What top ten?


476
00:46:11.706 --> 00:46:13.368
Stars.

477
00:46:13.457 --> 00:46:15.119
Directors.

478
00:46:15.209 --> 00:46:18.168
Producers. The big ones.

479
00:46:18.254 --> 00:46:22.214
The ones who stay on top
year after year after year.


480
00:46:22.341 --> 00:46:25.800
Who never seem to grow old.
Never slow down.


481
00:46:26.679 --> 00:46:30.548
Brother, I could tell you
something about that top ten.


482
00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:33.600
And don't think I won't tell it
in the right places.


483
00:46:33.686 --> 00:46:36.895
I've had it. Up to here.

484
00:46:37.606 --> 00:46:40.394
Eddie Storm and all the rest of them.

485
00:46:40.568 --> 00:46:44.027
- Eddie Storm, the producer?
- Producer? Ha!


486
00:46:44.405 --> 00:46:45.771
Listen.

487
00:46:46.032 --> 00:46:49.241
If you only knew the real story
behind that character.


488
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.493
I could tell it.

489
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.537
Here.

490
00:46:55.875 --> 00:46:57.537
On the house.

491
00:46:58.085 --> 00:47:01.578
You make yourself at home.
I gotta go out back for a minute.


492
00:47:15.227 --> 00:47:17.059
You're not eating.

493
00:47:17.938 --> 00:47:20.806
I start filming next week, remember?

494
00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.143
Now you know how I keep
my boyish figure.


495
00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:28.068
- And you?
- I'm on a diet.


496
00:47:33.162 --> 00:47:36.280
Excuse me, Mr Storm.
There's a call for you.


497
00:47:37.041 --> 00:47:38.657
I'll take it over there.

498
00:47:38.751 --> 00:47:41.209
- Will you excuse me?
- Yes.


499
00:47:50.388 --> 00:47:52.254
Boy, I never thought
when I went out tonight


500
00:47:52.431 --> 00:47:54.423
that all this would be happening.

501
00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:58.560
Meeting you, get a chance
to be in a film with you.


502
00:48:01.148 --> 00:48:03.231
I thought you'd wanna know.

503
00:48:04.068 --> 00:48:05.184
Sure.

504
00:48:05.277 --> 00:48:07.360
Sure, I understand.

505
00:48:07.446 --> 00:48:10.610
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

506
00:48:25.506 --> 00:48:28.044
Nothing important.
It's just a little problem.


507
00:48:28.509 --> 00:48:30.876
It's all been taken care of.

508
00:48:38.727 --> 00:48:42.016
- Where are we?
- Home. In your own garage.


509
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:45.477
Oh, you're a real pal. Thanks.

510
00:48:45.568 --> 00:48:47.275
Hey!

511
00:49:29.987 --> 00:49:32.070
Carla, did you see this?

512
00:49:32.156 --> 00:49:34.773
Mike Charles is dead.

513
00:49:35.451 --> 00:49:39.286
He was overcome by exhaust fumes
in his garage.


514
00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:41.488
It happened last night.

515
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:46.084
- Didn't he take you home?
- No.


516
00:49:47.671 --> 00:49:50.084
He left the restaurant
almost as soon as we got there.


517
00:49:50.174 --> 00:49:53.713
The paper says it was an accident.
He'd been drinking.


518
00:49:54.053 --> 00:49:56.340
How could he take you
to an expensive restaurant


519
00:49:56.514 --> 00:50:00.098
- and then just walk out?
- Look, Millie, I hardly knew the man.


520
00:50:00.226 --> 00:50:02.013
He was your date.

521
00:50:02.102 --> 00:50:04.685
Let's talk about something
more pleasant.


522
00:50:05.022 --> 00:50:06.888
Hey, I made a good contact
last night.


523
00:50:06.982 --> 00:50:10.566
Eddie Storm's testing me on Monday
for a part in a new Bruce Benton film.


524
00:50:10.653 --> 00:50:12.610
A good part.

525
00:50:13.531 --> 00:50:15.067
Look, I know it sounds
cold-blooded,


526
00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:17.862
but if a girl wants
to get ahead in this town,


527
00:50:18.035 --> 00:50:20.698
she's gotta take her chances
when she gets them.


528
00:50:20.871 --> 00:50:24.410
And not worry about what happens
to anybody else.


529
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.662
I wouldn't want to get there
that way.


530
00:50:27.628 --> 00:50:32.168
Millie, dear, I'm going to get there.

531
00:50:32.758 --> 00:50:34.670
Any way.

532
00:50:39.848 --> 00:50:41.259
Another day, another dollar.

533
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:44.218
- Tomorrow's call, Mr Benton.
- Thanks, Fred.


534
00:50:44.853 --> 00:50:46.435
Well,

535
00:50:46.689 --> 00:50:49.773
I see they've written
an extra scene for you.


536
00:50:50.442 --> 00:50:53.651
- You looked great in the shots today.
- I'd never have been in those shots


537
00:50:53.821 --> 00:50:55.687
if it wasn't for you.

538
00:50:59.952 --> 00:51:03.571
I got you something to show you
how much I appreciate it.


539
00:51:12.548 --> 00:51:16.633
- You can't afford a present like this.
- But I want you to have it.


540
00:51:16.719 --> 00:51:18.130
Put it on, okay?

541
00:51:20.514 --> 00:51:22.096
Thanks.

542
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.603
It was quite a day today.

543
00:51:31.483 --> 00:51:35.272
I'm really beat.
Where do you get all your energy?


544
00:51:36.322 --> 00:51:37.483
Clean living.

545
00:51:37.615 --> 00:51:39.481
It certainly doesn't come
from overeating.


546
00:51:39.617 --> 00:51:42.325
You didn't even touch
your lunch this noon.


547
00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:44.744
- I'll make up for it tonight.
- Where are we going?


548
00:51:57.301 --> 00:51:59.964
Not "we". Me.

549
00:52:00.971 --> 00:52:04.635
I thought you said something
about going out tonight.


550
00:52:05.684 --> 00:52:10.804
I'm sorry about the hang-up.
Not tonight. Tomorrow night.


551
00:52:11.148 --> 00:52:15.233
Well, what kind of hang-up is it,
blonde or brunette?


552
00:52:21.992 --> 00:52:23.824
Two brunets.

553
00:52:27.498 --> 00:52:28.830
Your agents?

554
00:52:31.377 --> 00:52:32.959
In a way.

555
00:52:34.004 --> 00:52:37.168
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.


556
00:53:04.743 --> 00:53:07.656
- Where's Bruce?
- You just missed him.


557
00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:09.537
But you didn't?

558
00:53:10.499 --> 00:53:13.412
Bruce and I were rehearsing
our lines for tomorrow.


559
00:53:13.919 --> 00:53:16.081
- That's all right, isn't it?
- Of course.


560
00:53:16.213 --> 00:53:17.749
Rehearsals never hurt anybody.

561
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.674
That's why I have them every day.
On the set.


562
00:53:22.052 --> 00:53:24.669
What's the matter, Mr Storm?
You have some reason for disliking me?


563
00:53:25.639 --> 00:53:27.801
I didn't say that. You I like.

564
00:53:28.225 --> 00:53:30.683
You and Bruce Benton together,
that's a bad scene.


565
00:53:30.811 --> 00:53:34.145
Take my advice and lay off.
He's not for you.


566
00:53:43.949 --> 00:53:45.986
There he is now. Bruce!

567
00:53:46.452 --> 00:53:48.819
Bruce! Wait!

568
00:53:50.205 --> 00:53:51.537
Where did he say he was going?

569
00:53:51.707 --> 00:53:53.414
He didn't. He just said he had
a business appointment.


570
00:53:53.625 --> 00:53:56.208
Business appointment?
With two of the worst hoods in town?


571
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.381
Don't panic. He's all right.

572
00:54:17.357 --> 00:54:21.818
Leo, help me get him
up to the car. Hurry!


573
00:54:23.322 --> 00:54:26.440
- Where you taking him?
- The sanatorium.


574
00:54:26.909 --> 00:54:28.741
Sunset Crest Sanatorium.

575
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.993
- What happened?
- The operation's over.


576
00:54:38.295 --> 00:54:40.161
Dr Heim says he'll be all right.

577
00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:41.705
That's impossible.

578
00:54:42.132 --> 00:54:44.795
Oh, no. It's true.

579
00:54:45.093 --> 00:54:46.379
Dr Heim.

580
00:54:46.595 --> 00:54:50.214
My dear young lady, let me assure
you, there is no cause for alarm.


581
00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.218
- Only for silence.
- He's right.


582
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.807
We can't have any publicity.
Bad for the picture.


583
00:54:57.523 --> 00:54:59.606
How can there be a picture
with Bruce...?


584
00:54:59.858 --> 00:55:03.147
The bullet has been removed.
He's resting comfortably.


585
00:55:03.737 --> 00:55:06.696
But I saw him. He was dead.

586
00:55:08.742 --> 00:55:11.155
- He's alive.
- Dr Heim's a great surgeon.


587
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.736
He has his own techniques.

588
00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:15.698
Believe me, dear lady,
your friend is quite safe.


589
00:55:16.291 --> 00:55:18.783
- When can I see him?
- Monday.


590
00:55:19.086 --> 00:55:21.078
He will be back on the set Monday.

591
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.477
Cut it!

592
00:55:39.106 --> 00:55:41.439
Great, Bruce, great. Okay, boys.

593
00:55:48.866 --> 00:55:50.778
Something wrong?

594
00:55:51.577 --> 00:55:54.991
- I can't believe it.
- Dr Heim told you he'd be here.


595
00:55:55.914 --> 00:55:57.871
Looks good, doesn't he?

596
00:55:59.334 --> 00:56:02.202
- I've gotta talk to you.
- Want you in five minutes, Carla.


597
00:56:02.379 --> 00:56:04.871
Let's go inside.

598
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:09.634
Okay, now take it in a fraction.
Right, that's it.


599
00:56:10.846 --> 00:56:13.884
<i>Somebody fix that backing there!</i>

600
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.058
When are you going
to tell me the truth?


601
00:56:17.519 --> 00:56:21.433
All right. You would find out
sooner or later anyway.


602
00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:25.729
The man we saw in the car
the other night was Bruce's double.


603
00:56:25.819 --> 00:56:28.607
His double?
Look, I know his stand-in.


604
00:56:28.906 --> 00:56:30.147
I said, double.

605
00:56:30.407 --> 00:56:32.114
Let's face it, 
Bruce is getting along.

606
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.487
He needs somebody
to share the load.


607
00:56:34.745 --> 00:56:36.111
After all, how do you imagine

608
00:56:36.288 --> 00:56:39.577
he's kept going as a top star
for over thirty years?


609
00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:41.870
Now you know the secret.

610
00:56:42.252 --> 00:56:44.835
But you still haven't told me
what happened.


611
00:56:45.631 --> 00:56:48.920
Just what you saw.
Bruce's double owed gambling debts.


612
00:56:49.259 --> 00:56:51.876
He was taken for a ride and killed.

613
00:56:52.262 --> 00:56:54.128
Then Dr Heim didn't operate.

614
00:56:54.222 --> 00:56:57.841
No. He merely disposed of the body.

615
00:56:59.102 --> 00:57:00.843
Who is Dr Heim?

616
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:03.228
No more secrets.
You know too much already.


617
00:57:04.107 --> 00:57:06.440
Perhaps I know more than you think.

618
00:57:06.735 --> 00:57:08.442
What are you talking about?

619
00:57:08.612 --> 00:57:13.027
I did a little reading over the weekend.
At the newspaper office.


620
00:57:13.367 --> 00:57:17.611
Some old clippings.
They keep a file there, you know.


621
00:57:17.955 --> 00:57:19.787
Called a morgue.

622
00:57:20.415 --> 00:57:24.159
- It's very appropriate, don't you think?
- What are you getting at?


623
00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:28.000
I thought I was getting at the truth
about Dr Heim,


624
00:57:28.632 --> 00:57:30.589
but instead I found out
something else.


625
00:57:31.426 --> 00:57:32.758
About you.

626
00:57:33.553 --> 00:57:35.340
On April 5th, 1944,

627
00:57:35.555 --> 00:57:38.764
...there was a speedboat accident
in the harbour off Newport Beach.


628
00:57:39.184 --> 00:57:40.891
You were thrown from the boat.

629
00:57:41.019 --> 00:57:43.807
When they took you to the hospital,
they thought you were dying.


630
00:57:43.939 --> 00:57:45.146
According to the story,

631
00:57:45.315 --> 00:57:48.479
you were rushed from that hospital
to a private clinic:


632
00:57:48.652 --> 00:57:51.065
Sunset Crest Sanatorium.

633
00:57:51.488 --> 00:57:55.198
The man who operated on you
there was a refugee physician.


634
00:57:55.867 --> 00:57:57.074
A Dr Heim.

635
00:57:57.202 --> 00:57:58.989
<i>Two minutes, 
Miss Hayes.</i>

636
00:57:59.162 --> 00:58:01.779
Yes, it's true. He saved me.

637
00:58:02.124 --> 00:58:05.868
- A wonderful plastic surgeon.
- He must have been.


638
00:58:07.963 --> 00:58:11.422
According to that newspaper story,
your entire skull and chest


639
00:58:11.591 --> 00:58:14.208
had been crushed beyond repair.

640
00:58:17.973 --> 00:58:20.056
I don't see any scars, Mr Storm.

641
00:58:20.308 --> 00:58:22.220
- I've had enough of this.
- Well, I haven't.


642
00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:25.929
I'm gonna see Bruce tonight,
and he'll tell me the truth.


643
00:58:38.618 --> 00:58:41.110
- Have you seen Mr Benton?
- I haven't seen him leave yet.


644
00:58:41.288 --> 00:58:42.699
Thank you.

645
00:59:13.111 --> 00:59:14.818
Main gate?

646
00:59:15.363 --> 00:59:19.824
As soon as Dr Heim gets here,
send him to Stage G.


647
00:59:22.204 --> 00:59:24.116
It doesn't concern you.

648
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:26.781
Don't you see?
I have to know the truth.


649
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.834
- There's nothing to tell you.
- Oh yes there is.


650
00:59:30.212 --> 00:59:31.544
Carla, please.

651
00:59:34.841 --> 00:59:37.424
You were the one who was shot.

652
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:40.094
You were the one that we took
to the sanatorium.


653
00:59:40.263 --> 00:59:42.300
You'd better get out.
I'm not gonna talk about it.


654
00:59:42.432 --> 00:59:44.594
But you've gotta talk about it.

655
00:59:44.768 --> 00:59:46.851
Bruce, don't you understand?

656
00:59:46.937 --> 00:59:49.850
- I'm in love with you.
- No, you can't be in love with me.


657
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.774
Bruce, what happened?
What is it about Dr Heim?


658
01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.293
It's metal.

659
01:00:17.968 --> 01:00:19.584
All right.

660
01:00:20.053 --> 01:00:22.420
Look at it. Take a good look.

661
01:00:22.722 --> 01:00:24.714
You wanted to know
the secret of the top ten.


662
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:27.679
The box-office stars who seem
to go on forever and ever.


663
01:00:27.936 --> 01:00:32.806
The ones who never age.
The immortals of the screen.


664
01:00:32.983 --> 01:00:36.351
Well, now you know the secret.
They are immortal.


665
01:00:37.028 --> 01:00:40.066
- It's Dr Heim.
- Yes. Dr Heim.


666
01:00:40.824 --> 01:00:44.659
He found a way of preserving
the brain and its abilities


667
01:00:44.828 --> 01:00:47.070
in a synthetic body.

668
01:00:47.289 --> 01:00:50.407
He did that to you and Eddie Storm?

669
01:00:50.834 --> 01:00:55.454
Yes. There are a few of us,
but only a few.


670
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:57.496
And you don't have
to have an accident.


671
01:00:58.008 --> 01:01:00.341
But you must be
a very special person,


672
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.502
with a very special hunger.

673
01:01:03.013 --> 01:01:04.845
Not for food, or drink,

674
01:01:05.015 --> 01:01:07.974
or love.
You can't have any of those.


675
01:01:08.351 --> 01:01:12.686
You must live to feed only
on the applause and the fame.


676
01:01:14.065 --> 01:01:16.022
For some of us, it's enough.

677
01:01:17.068 --> 01:01:18.980
I'd rather be dead.

678
01:01:22.616 --> 01:01:23.777
So,

679
01:01:23.992 --> 01:01:25.779
we are in time.

680
01:01:28.496 --> 01:01:30.158
You told her?

681
01:01:33.168 --> 01:01:35.000
Then we have no choice.

682
01:01:35.086 --> 01:01:38.124
- What are you gonna do?
- Mike Charles knew the secret.


683
01:01:38.381 --> 01:01:40.088
He wanted to be one of us.

684
01:01:40.175 --> 01:01:42.838
When we refused,
he threatened to talk.


685
01:01:42.928 --> 01:01:46.012
We couldn't risk that with him
and we can't risk it with you.


686
01:01:46.431 --> 01:01:47.672
Wait.

687
01:01:50.268 --> 01:01:51.975
There is another way.

688
01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:54.512
You once told me
about your ambitions,


689
01:01:54.689 --> 01:01:57.557
that you'd do anything
for fame and stardom.


690
01:01:57.984 --> 01:02:00.476
You can have your wish.

691
01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.112
No.

692
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:06.399
- How soon can you operate?
- Immediately.


693
01:02:07.035 --> 01:02:08.947
- No!
- Nurse!


694
01:02:16.419 --> 01:02:18.331
And here are the stars
of this production:


695
01:02:18.421 --> 01:02:21.539
Bruce Benton
and the lovely Carla Hayes.


696
01:02:21.758 --> 01:02:24.466
Miss Hayes, I understand that
your performance in this picture


697
01:02:24.636 --> 01:02:28.596
indicates that you'll soon be in
the top ten in filmdom.


698
01:02:30.183 --> 01:02:33.017
- Look, there's Carla Hayes!
- Isn't she a doll!


699
01:02:33.103 --> 01:02:35.766
A living doll!

700
01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:43.652
There, there, that's all right.

701
01:02:43.738 --> 01:02:46.025
Now, don't be afraid.
That's all in your mind.


702
01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:49.154
That was a warning
sounding in your mind.


703
01:02:49.244 --> 01:02:52.703
It's a warning of things
that can be, of course.


704
01:02:52.956 --> 01:02:55.243
For now, they are without
substance, they're images.


705
01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:57.950
They're the kind of things
that dreams are made of.


706
01:02:58.044 --> 01:03:01.833
Oh, the mind is a strange animal,
isn't it?


707
01:03:02.048 --> 01:03:04.711
It can turn on you like a panther.

708
01:03:04.884 --> 01:03:08.548
But, of course, like a panther,
it can be tamed


709
01:03:08.722 --> 01:03:12.966
by certain people. And that's a kind
of a blessing, don't you agree?


710
01:03:13.852 --> 01:03:15.468
I don't know why we came here.

711
01:03:15.854 --> 01:03:17.561
For the mystery and the excitement.

712
01:03:17.647 --> 01:03:21.231
But you have obtained more
than you bargained for.


713
01:03:21.318 --> 01:03:25.779
- You've obtained knowledge.
- You're quite a philosopher.


714
01:03:26.114 --> 01:03:27.946
Yes, I try to be.

715
01:03:28.116 --> 01:03:31.484
Now, who is next?
Who wants to meet the Goddess


716
01:03:31.661 --> 01:03:34.574
and take this fascinating journey?
You?


717
01:03:34.748 --> 01:03:38.867
- Dorothy, don't.
- Don't worry. I'm not afraid.


718
01:03:39.044 --> 01:03:40.706
Ah.

719
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.914
Look at the shears.
Look at the shears.


720
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.711
Deeply, deeply, deeply

721
01:03:46.885 --> 01:03:49.502
you gaze at the shears.

722
01:03:50.013 --> 01:03:52.551
Look at the shears of fate.

723
01:04:32.639 --> 01:04:35.131
Miss Endicott? 
I'm Maxine Chambers.

724
01:04:35.225 --> 01:04:36.682
Leo Winston's manager.

725
01:04:36.768 --> 01:04:39.101
I saw from his diary
he was expecting you today.


726
01:04:39.187 --> 01:04:41.270
I thought you were interviewing
him yesterday.


727
01:04:41.439 --> 01:04:43.522
Yes, but he had to rush off to a concert,
as you know,


728
01:04:43.691 --> 01:04:45.398
so we thought
we'd continue today.


729
01:04:45.568 --> 01:04:46.900
I see.

730
01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.312
I'm afraid he won't be able
to spare you very much time.


731
01:04:49.447 --> 01:04:52.565
- He has to rehearse this evening.
- Thank you.


732
01:05:02.293 --> 01:05:05.627
- Milk and sugar?
- No, thank you.


733
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:09.256
I really hate to stop.

734
01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:11.629
There's so much more
I'd like to know about you.


735
01:05:11.845 --> 01:05:14.963
If I gave your readers any more
material, they'd complain of eyestrain.


736
01:05:15.056 --> 01:05:17.264
I wasn't thinking of my readers,
Mr Winston.


737
01:05:18.768 --> 01:05:20.680
You're very flattering.

738
01:05:25.024 --> 01:05:27.141
You really do love music, don't you?

739
01:05:27.235 --> 01:05:29.101
Yes, I do.

740
01:05:29.446 --> 01:05:32.154
In that case, perhaps
you'd better meet Euterpe.


741
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.151
Who?

742
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:36.659
Come in here, and I'll show you.

743
01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.787
Oh, Euterpe, the goddess of music.

744
01:05:48.715 --> 01:05:50.297
Yes.

745
01:05:51.259 --> 01:05:54.343
Yes, it was a present from my mother
before she died.


746
01:05:57.765 --> 01:06:01.429
Euterpe and I have been together
for years now.


747
01:06:08.234 --> 01:06:10.521
Shall we play something
for the lady?


748
01:06:53.738 --> 01:06:56.025
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that wasn't very good.


749
01:06:56.199 --> 01:06:57.656
Oh, I shouldn't have let you.

750
01:06:57.742 --> 01:06:59.950
You must be tired
after last night's concert.


751
01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:01.277
No.

752
01:07:01.913 --> 01:07:03.996
No, it's not that.

753
01:07:04.707 --> 01:07:07.825
It's just that
Euterpe isn't used to you yet.


754
01:07:07.919 --> 01:07:10.787
Please accept my apologies for her.

755
01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.793
Perhaps she doesn't like me.

756
01:07:16.261 --> 01:07:17.718
I do.

757
01:07:20.014 --> 01:07:22.381
I was just thinking.

758
01:07:23.059 --> 01:07:25.016
You're quite a lonely person,
aren't you?


759
01:07:25.186 --> 01:07:26.893
What makes you say that?

760
01:07:27.897 --> 01:07:30.310
This habit you have
of talking to yourself.


761
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.892
I couldn't help noticing
this afternoon.


762
01:07:33.403 --> 01:07:36.316
I was talking to Euterpe.

763
01:07:36.906 --> 01:07:39.694
You mean I'm going
to have a piano for a rival?


764
01:07:40.285 --> 01:07:42.197
No, it's...

765
01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.488
It's just that I haven't had time to...

766
01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:50.701
Believe me, Dorothy,
you have no rivals.


767
01:07:53.464 --> 01:07:56.298
It's no good.
I'm making too many mistakes.


768
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:59.968
- Why?
- I don't know.


769
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:01.762
Don't you?

770
01:08:02.515 --> 01:08:05.349
- How many hours a day do you practice?
- Quite enough.


771
01:08:05.602 --> 01:08:07.309
Until what time
are you out every night?


772
01:08:07.395 --> 01:08:10.058
I can't see what possible
difference that makes.


773
01:08:10.231 --> 01:08:13.065
Leo, I'm sorry
if I'm speaking out of turn,


774
01:08:13.234 --> 01:08:15.851
but I'm your friend,
I'm not just your manager.


775
01:08:16.237 --> 01:08:18.399
And I can't stand by
and watch that girl


776
01:08:18.573 --> 01:08:20.781
take over your life,
ruin your career.


777
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:23.442
You sound exactly like my mother.

778
01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:26.533
Whenever I used to bring a girl home,
all she would ever say to me was


779
01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:29.119
that it was going
to ruin my career.


780
01:08:29.292 --> 01:08:31.375
You're in love with her.

781
01:08:33.087 --> 01:08:34.749
Yes.

782
01:08:37.175 --> 01:08:38.711
And I think she loves me too.

783
01:08:39.093 --> 01:08:40.254
Well, in that case,

784
01:08:40.428 --> 01:08:43.011
you're just going to have to try
and make her understand.


785
01:08:43.181 --> 01:08:45.764
She just can't go on
being so demanding.


786
01:08:46.976 --> 01:08:48.717
Look, Maxine,

787
01:08:49.187 --> 01:08:52.100
you're a good manager
and a good friend.


788
01:08:52.398 --> 01:08:55.357
But you don't have to worry
about me in either capacity.


789
01:08:55.443 --> 01:08:57.810
Dorothy hasn't ruined my life.

790
01:08:58.071 --> 01:09:01.189
For the first time in years,
I feel really happy.


791
01:09:22.845 --> 01:09:23.801
Leo?

792
01:09:36.067 --> 01:09:37.603
Leo?

793
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.396
Leo?

794
01:09:49.706 --> 01:09:51.789
What's the matter?

795
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.707
Are you all right?

796
01:09:57.255 --> 01:09:58.917
Yes, of course.

797
01:10:04.303 --> 01:10:07.137
I was just working something out
for my next concert.


798
01:10:07.306 --> 01:10:10.014
I shouldn't have interrupted you,
but I've got something for you,


799
01:10:10.184 --> 01:10:12.597
and I couldn't wait
to give it to you.


800
01:10:15.523 --> 01:10:18.687
And we're invited
to the Harcourts' tonight.


801
01:10:23.448 --> 01:10:25.610
- Do you like it?
- Yes.


802
01:10:25.992 --> 01:10:27.779
Yes, it's lovely.

803
01:10:30.079 --> 01:10:31.786
Dorothy,

804
01:10:32.415 --> 01:10:35.374
- about tonight...
- Yes. Pick me up at eight o'clock.


805
01:10:39.046 --> 01:10:40.958
Yes, of course.

806
01:10:41.299 --> 01:10:42.506
Let's go and have a drink.

807
01:10:57.064 --> 01:10:58.771
Leo, what's the matter?

808
01:10:58.858 --> 01:11:01.020
Nothing.

809
01:11:02.153 --> 01:11:05.237
When I came in there,
you were sitting


810
01:11:05.656 --> 01:11:08.319
as if you were in a trance.

811
01:11:08.618 --> 01:11:10.780
I was just tired.

812
01:11:11.037 --> 01:11:13.575
There's no need to worry about me.

813
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.123
Tell me the truth.

814
01:11:18.044 --> 01:11:21.378
Oh, very well. I suppose
you've got to know sooner or later.


815
01:11:22.924 --> 01:11:25.758
It's Euterpe. She resents you.

816
01:11:26.385 --> 01:11:27.421
You see,

817
01:11:27.595 --> 01:11:30.429
I've been trying
to communicate with her.


818
01:11:31.057 --> 01:11:34.141
She thinks you're hurting me
and preventing me from working.


819
01:11:34.519 --> 01:11:36.806
- She wants to protect me.
- Is this some sort of joke?


820
01:11:36.979 --> 01:11:40.313
Pretending that a piano is a...?

821
01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:56.409
No, I haven't come here
to talk about myself.


822
01:11:56.916 --> 01:11:59.203
But you've got to do
something about Leo.


823
01:11:59.669 --> 01:12:02.878
You've got to cancel his tour,
he's in no condition for it.


824
01:12:03.172 --> 01:12:05.255
If we don't do something,
he'll have a breakdown.


825
01:12:05.341 --> 01:12:06.673
Yes, I know.

826
01:12:07.468 --> 01:12:09.881
If Leo isn't well, it's because
you're smothering him.


827
01:12:11.222 --> 01:12:14.090
You're smothering him
with your demands on his time,


828
01:12:14.267 --> 01:12:15.758
your possessiveness.

829
01:12:15.935 --> 01:12:20.179
You just aren't the sort of person
Leo needs, believe me.


830
01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:23.349
- I love him.
- Do you?


831
01:12:23.734 --> 01:12:26.977
Or do you just love the idea of being
the wife of a world-famous pianist?


832
01:12:27.572 --> 01:12:29.438
Is your love real?

833
01:12:29.657 --> 01:12:32.741
- Or just selfish?
- Oh, you're the selfish one.


834
01:12:33.035 --> 01:12:36.574
All you're interested in is making
money out of Leo's career.


835
01:12:36.831 --> 01:12:38.663
First his mother and now you,

836
01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:42.577
and this ridiculous story
about Euterpe.


837
01:12:43.045 --> 01:12:45.412
- Euterpe?
- Don't pretend you don't know about it.


838
01:12:45.506 --> 01:12:48.874
You probably encourage it.
But it won't work. I won't let it.


839
01:12:49.552 --> 01:12:51.839
Leo belongs to me now.

840
01:13:05.484 --> 01:13:06.474
Leo?

841
01:13:08.613 --> 01:13:10.400
Leo?

842
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:13.197
Leo?

843
01:13:13.576 --> 01:13:14.657
Leo! Leo!

844
01:13:15.411 --> 01:13:16.743
<i>Leo!</i>

845
01:13:18.164 --> 01:13:20.121
Dorothy?

846
01:13:27.673 --> 01:13:30.086
I heard the piano playing.

847
01:13:30.676 --> 01:13:33.919
- And then you answered the door.
- Yes.


848
01:13:35.556 --> 01:13:38.299
But that's not possible. You...

849
01:13:38.893 --> 01:13:42.432
You couldn't have come from
the piano to the door so quickly.


850
01:13:42.939 --> 01:13:45.397
I wasn't playing, it was Euterpe.

851
01:14:03.209 --> 01:14:05.952
- Leo, come here.
- It's only a metronome.


852
01:14:06.128 --> 01:14:07.494
Yes,

853
01:14:07.755 --> 01:14:10.338
and this is only a piano.

854
01:14:11.342 --> 01:14:15.461
There's nothing here
but wood and metal and ivory.


855
01:14:15.554 --> 01:14:17.796
It's got no life of its own.

856
01:14:18.307 --> 01:14:20.674
And it can't interfere with ours.

857
01:14:23.521 --> 01:14:27.140
You're tired.
We'll go away together.


858
01:14:28.317 --> 01:14:31.185
- Away from...
- What about my concert tour?


859
01:14:31.487 --> 01:14:34.150
Oh, I spoke to Maxine today.
I told her she'd have to postpone it.


860
01:14:34.323 --> 01:14:36.155
Well, what did she say?

861
01:14:36.325 --> 01:14:38.282
She'll come round.

862
01:15:08.983 --> 01:15:11.145
You're not angry with me, are you?

863
01:15:11.235 --> 01:15:13.727
No, of course not.

864
01:15:16.115 --> 01:15:19.074
I know I'm tired. It's just that
I've never missed a tour before.


865
01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.493
Leo, you'd better
make up your mind.


866
01:15:21.579 --> 01:15:26.495
Either we go away together,
or I'll go by myself.


867
01:15:28.461 --> 01:15:31.249
- You really mean that, don't you?
- Yes.


868
01:15:33.049 --> 01:15:35.632
In that case, I have no choice.

869
01:15:36.677 --> 01:15:38.543
When do you want to leave?

870
01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.348
Well, we could go tonight.

871
01:15:43.851 --> 01:15:49.392
We could ring Maxine from
wherever we are in the morning.


872
01:15:50.983 --> 01:15:54.067
You go and pack,
and then I'll pick up my things.


873
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.062
Leo?

874
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.152
Leo?

875
01:16:41.325 --> 01:16:43.942
Leo? Leo?

876
01:16:44.912 --> 01:16:46.369
Leo!

877
01:16:47.456 --> 01:16:48.947
Leo.

878
01:17:09.854 --> 01:17:10.594
No.

879
01:17:19.196 --> 01:17:20.528
No!

880
01:17:23.826 --> 01:17:25.442
No! No!

881
01:17:26.704 --> 01:17:29.447
No! No! No!

882
01:18:10.164 --> 01:18:13.373
Look what he's done.
He's frightened you.


883
01:18:14.043 --> 01:18:16.535
- No, I'm all right.
- What did you see?


884
01:18:17.963 --> 01:18:20.922
- Just an illusion.
- An illusion?


885
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.132
That's very good!

886
01:18:23.427 --> 01:18:28.138
Call it whatever you want.
An illusion, a fantasy, a memory.


887
01:18:28.432 --> 01:18:30.765
Now, that's very good too.
A memory,


888
01:18:31.018 --> 01:18:32.805
but a memory of the future.

889
01:18:32.978 --> 01:18:36.813
A memory of the shape
of things to come.


890
01:18:37.191 --> 01:18:38.432
Now then,

891
01:18:38.609 --> 01:18:40.521
which of you two gentlemen

892
01:18:40.694 --> 01:18:45.109
will be next to take this plunge
into the river of time?


893
01:18:45.491 --> 01:18:47.278
Oh, not you, eh?

894
01:18:47.451 --> 01:18:50.819
Afraid. Are you afraid?

895
01:18:51.914 --> 01:18:53.325
You?

896
01:18:53.415 --> 01:18:54.121
No.

897
01:18:55.584 --> 01:18:58.918
As a matter of fact,
I've always wanted to, er,


898
01:18:59.296 --> 01:19:01.583
sample your wares.

899
01:19:03.092 --> 01:19:04.549
Very well.

900
01:19:05.177 --> 01:19:07.715
Very well, then. 
Look at the shears.

901
01:19:08.264 --> 01:19:10.472
Look at the shears, sir.

902
01:19:10.557 --> 01:19:14.972
Look at the shears.
Deeper and deeper and deeper.


903
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:17.346
Look at the shears.

904
01:19:17.773 --> 01:19:20.641
Look at the shears of fate.

905
01:19:40.963 --> 01:19:43.421
First edition, isn't it?

906
01:19:43.716 --> 01:19:46.174
A great rarity to the collector
of Edgar Allan Poe.


907
01:19:46.343 --> 01:19:50.212
Yes, I know.
Might I ask where you obtained it?


908
01:19:50.347 --> 01:19:52.634
It isn't mine.
This gentleman owns the collection.


909
01:19:52.808 --> 01:19:55.676
Lancelot Canning,
this is Mr Ronald Wyatt.


910
01:19:55.769 --> 01:19:59.058
I was just admiring your collection.

911
01:19:59.148 --> 01:20:02.186
Does this volume
happen to be for sale?


912
01:20:02.359 --> 01:20:04.817
Oh, I'm afraid not.
As you probably know,


913
01:20:04.987 --> 01:20:06.774
only six of these
are known to exist.


914
01:20:06.947 --> 01:20:11.282
- Yes, I'm well aware of that.
- You are interested in Poe?


915
01:20:11.368 --> 01:20:15.908
Mr Canning is probably the world's
greatest collector of Poe memorabilia.


916
01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:20.534
I'm prepared to pay
a very good price.


917
01:20:21.045 --> 01:20:24.459
I'm sorry. My collection
must remain complete.


918
01:20:24.631 --> 01:20:26.839
Mr Canning has many other things
besides these books.


919
01:20:27.009 --> 01:20:29.547
More than you
can possibly imagine.


920
01:20:31.096 --> 01:20:32.803
<i>Al Aaraaf.</i>

921
01:20:33.015 --> 01:20:36.053
<i>- And Tamerlane.
- Yes. And Collected Poems, 1829.</i>


922
01:20:36.226 --> 01:20:39.435
- Boston edition.
- Yes. Cost you $15,000 at least


923
01:20:39.605 --> 01:20:41.346
at Sotheby's last year.

924
01:20:41.732 --> 01:20:46.147
<i>Prose Romance, 1843,
sold in that year for 12 cents.</i>


925
01:20:46.528 --> 01:20:49.737
Value now $50,000.

926
01:20:50.074 --> 01:20:52.031
We have much in common.

927
01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:53.988
If you should ever come
to the States,


928
01:20:54.161 --> 01:20:56.244
perhaps you might care
to see my collection.


929
01:20:56.413 --> 01:20:58.370
You live in America?

930
01:20:58.624 --> 01:21:02.368
My whole life is centered around
Edgar Allan Poe in every respect.


931
01:21:02.544 --> 01:21:04.581
Well, I will most certainly
take advantage


932
01:21:04.755 --> 01:21:07.418
of your invitation
when I'm in Maryland.


933
01:21:07.591 --> 01:21:10.004
- I shall look forward to seeing you.
- Yes, thank you.


934
01:21:10.094 --> 01:21:11.960
Excuse me.

935
01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:35.032
Mr Wyatt?

936
01:21:35.244 --> 01:21:36.985
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

937
01:21:37.079 --> 01:21:39.241
I must admit, didn't expect to
see you again quite so soon.


938
01:21:39.415 --> 01:21:42.374
It's interesting, very interesting.

939
01:21:42.459 --> 01:21:43.995
My grandfather's idea.

940
01:21:44.086 --> 01:21:46.669
He built this house
when he started his Poe collection.


941
01:21:46.755 --> 01:21:49.293
My father and I merely
followed in his footsteps.


942
01:21:49.675 --> 01:21:52.793
That's Poe's cravat. He wore it in
Baltimore during his last lecture appearance.


943
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:56.680
You have other items
from his wardrobe as well?


944
01:21:56.974 --> 01:21:59.967
My collection is very complete.

945
01:22:01.186 --> 01:22:03.769
Did you know
that he played the flute?


946
01:22:04.314 --> 01:22:06.806
No. Did he really?

947
01:22:07.985 --> 01:22:10.853
There. Oh, I'm sorry,
I should've asked you before.


948
01:22:10.946 --> 01:22:13.063
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yes, thank you.


949
01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.481
- Whisky?
- Yes.


950
01:22:14.658 --> 01:22:17.275
- Or sherry?
- Oh, yes, thank you.


951
01:22:28.088 --> 01:22:30.421
Oh, this is lovely.

952
01:22:32.509 --> 01:22:34.125
Yes.

953
01:22:40.267 --> 01:22:43.851
- To your health.
- And to your collection.


954
01:22:44.271 --> 01:22:45.682
There speaks the true collector.

955
01:22:45.772 --> 01:22:48.606
My father was like that.
And so was his.


956
01:22:49.109 --> 01:22:51.852
Today they'd both be called fanatics.

957
01:22:52.154 --> 01:22:56.398
It's true. Collecting can become
a kind of mania.


958
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:06.078
What a strange man he was.

959
01:23:06.168 --> 01:23:11.334
What a fascination he exerted over
the minds of those who loved fantasy.


960
01:23:13.383 --> 01:23:15.170
Or do you think
it's because people


961
01:23:15.385 --> 01:23:18.344
are fascinated
by the mystery of death?


962
01:23:19.556 --> 01:23:21.092
No one will ever equal
his knowledge


963
01:23:21.266 --> 01:23:23.883
of the secrets
that lie beyond the grave.


964
01:23:24.811 --> 01:23:27.178
Let us drink to the immortal

965
01:23:27.314 --> 01:23:30.398
Edgar Allan Poe.

966
01:24:08.063 --> 01:24:11.056
Oh, no. No, thank you,
I've had enough.


967
01:24:11.316 --> 01:24:14.730
I go on drinking like this,
you'll think I'm Poe himself.


968
01:24:19.825 --> 01:24:21.361
Thank you.

969
01:24:22.327 --> 01:24:25.911
Now, then.
Do you want to see downstairs?


970
01:24:26.331 --> 01:24:29.369
- Why? What's down there?
- The rest of my treasures.


971
01:24:29.459 --> 01:24:31.746
That's why you encouraged me
to drink, wasn't it?


972
01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.912
- You wanted me to show you more.
- Oh, really...


973
01:24:34.047 --> 01:24:38.257
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I was going to show you anyway.


974
01:24:42.389 --> 01:24:43.880
Come along.

975
01:24:48.228 --> 01:24:52.313
There's one thing you must
promise me first.


976
01:24:52.983 --> 01:24:56.647
What I'm going to show you now
will remain a secret between us?


977
01:24:56.862 --> 01:24:58.103
Oh, yes, of course.

978
01:24:58.363 --> 01:25:01.356
Good. Good man.

979
01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:22.252
You're a very privileged man,
Mr Wyatt.


980
01:25:22.346 --> 01:25:26.556
Not a living soul has been
down here since my father died.


981
01:26:07.849 --> 01:26:09.340
It's fabulous.

982
01:26:09.434 --> 01:26:11.767
Absolutely fabulous.

983
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.728
Here are my real treasures.

984
01:26:24.491 --> 01:26:28.201
Poe's original manuscript?
Yes, but...


985
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:31.534
I thought they were all
in university collections.


986
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:33.326
See for yourself.

987
01:26:33.542 --> 01:26:36.285
You saw his letters upstairs.
You recognise his handwriting.


988
01:26:36.461 --> 01:26:38.498
- This is the same.
- Yes, but,


989
01:26:38.672 --> 01:26:42.757
<i>I don't recognise the title,
The House of the Worm.</i>


990
01:26:46.012 --> 01:26:51.053
Is this an unpublished work?

991
01:26:51.476 --> 01:26:52.842
All these are unpublished.

992
01:26:52.936 --> 01:26:56.520
I've read everything
ever written about Poe.


993
01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.024
I never read any mention
of unpublished stories.


994
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:04.354
Nobody else knows. But you can
see for yourself, this is genuine.


995
01:27:07.784 --> 01:27:10.743
I suppose you wouldn't be
interested in, er,


996
01:27:11.496 --> 01:27:13.078
parting with any of this, huh?

997
01:27:13.457 --> 01:27:16.450
That's right. I wouldn't.

998
01:27:28.805 --> 01:27:33.470
Well, what part did this box
play in the life of Poe?


999
01:27:34.853 --> 01:27:36.719
Oh, nothing.

1000
01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.147
Well, why is it here?

1001
01:27:42.444 --> 01:27:45.562
I'll tell you about it
when we get upstairs.


1002
01:27:45.655 --> 01:27:47.863
It's getting late.

1003
01:27:49.951 --> 01:27:53.535
Please, please. No, please...
No, I...


1004
01:27:53.997 --> 01:27:56.580
Oh, I must see more.

1005
01:27:57.501 --> 01:27:58.833
No.

1006
01:27:59.044 --> 01:28:01.206
<i>The Further Adventures of</i>

1007
01:28:01.546 --> 01:28:04.004
<i>Arthur Gordon Pym.</i>

1008
01:28:06.635 --> 01:28:09.298
Look at that paper, look.
Look at...


1009
01:28:10.806 --> 01:28:12.843
This paper is...

1010
01:28:13.266 --> 01:28:15.303
Why, it's almost new.

1011
01:28:16.645 --> 01:28:19.103
Oh, yes. Yes, look at...

1012
01:28:19.898 --> 01:28:24.142
Look at the watermark.
"Weber and Sons, 19-"


1013
01:28:27.197 --> 01:28:28.688
1966.

1014
01:28:29.533 --> 01:28:32.492
Well, that's impossible.
A mistake.


1015
01:28:32.619 --> 01:28:35.953
- It's just a trick of the light.
- Oh, it's a trick, all right.


1016
01:28:36.206 --> 01:28:39.290
And I want to know the truth.

1017
01:28:40.126 --> 01:28:41.958
- We must go upstairs now.
- No.


1018
01:28:42.128 --> 01:28:45.337
No, you're going to tell me.
You're going to tell me, or I'll...


1019
01:28:46.383 --> 01:28:50.798
I'll break my promise of silence.
Now, what's the secret?


1020
01:28:52.097 --> 01:28:55.431
Oh, yes.

1021
01:28:55.725 --> 01:28:58.092
You wrote these stories, didn't you?

1022
01:28:58.562 --> 01:29:02.397
Didn't you?
You wrote them, didn't you?


1023
01:29:07.696 --> 01:29:10.564
- No, I didn't write them.
- Then who did?


1024
01:29:10.824 --> 01:29:12.486
Who did?

1025
01:29:23.128 --> 01:29:25.290
- This box.
- You told me it had nothing to do


1026
01:29:25.463 --> 01:29:27.250
- with the life of Poe.
- That's right.


1027
01:29:27.465 --> 01:29:30.333
It had nothing to do with his life.

1028
01:29:30.802 --> 01:29:33.260
But it had to do with his death.

1029
01:29:34.639 --> 01:29:36.175
My grandfather

1030
01:29:36.349 --> 01:29:39.387
made money by selling cadavers
to medical students.


1031
01:29:39.936 --> 01:29:41.518
Robbing graves?

1032
01:29:41.897 --> 01:29:45.265
One of the graves he opened
was the last resting place


1033
01:29:45.442 --> 01:29:47.525
of Edgar Allan Poe.

1034
01:29:47.903 --> 01:29:50.361
The body, of course,
had crumbled to dust.


1035
01:29:50.739 --> 01:29:54.278
But he gathered that dust
and kept it.


1036
01:29:54.784 --> 01:29:56.776
In this box.

1037
01:30:00.123 --> 01:30:03.742
So you see, he really was
the greatest collector.


1038
01:30:04.252 --> 01:30:07.996
He even collected
Edgar Allan Poe himself.


1039
01:30:14.638 --> 01:30:18.052
You're lying! We both can see
the box is empty.


1040
01:30:20.518 --> 01:30:24.262
But... and this is the real secret.

1041
01:30:26.274 --> 01:30:28.766
My grandfather was more
than a grave robber.


1042
01:30:29.611 --> 01:30:31.568
He was a student of the occult.

1043
01:30:31.947 --> 01:30:34.735
Did you know that there are ways
to raise the dead?


1044
01:30:35.408 --> 01:30:37.616
To reanimate the dust?

1045
01:30:37.994 --> 01:30:40.327
Now, those stories by Poe,

1046
01:30:40.914 --> 01:30:43.531
filled with nameless terrors,

1047
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.116
are written on modern paper

1048
01:30:45.293 --> 01:30:47.751
because Poe has been
brought back to us.


1049
01:30:48.171 --> 01:30:49.332
He's still alive.

1050
01:30:50.006 --> 01:30:52.043
You expect me to believe that?

1051
01:30:54.719 --> 01:30:56.961
You can believe what you like.

1052
01:30:57.472 --> 01:31:00.135
Now, you put those
manuscripts back.


1053
01:31:00.684 --> 01:31:03.051
We're going upstairs.

1054
01:31:10.402 --> 01:31:12.485
There's a third key here.

1055
01:31:14.781 --> 01:31:17.023
Is it for that door?

1056
01:31:18.493 --> 01:31:19.279
No.

1057
01:31:20.578 --> 01:31:21.318
No.

1058
01:31:23.832 --> 01:31:26.119
Then what's it for?

1059
01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.702
- Give me those keys.
- No.


1060
01:31:30.255 --> 01:31:33.919
No. You're hiding more treasures
from me, aren't you?


1061
01:31:34.759 --> 01:31:38.719
I want to see if you've been
telling me the truth. I want to see!


1062
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:41.422
- You give me those keys.
- No, I won't!


1063
01:31:41.516 --> 01:31:42.256
No!

1064
01:33:36.464 --> 01:33:39.298
Mr Poe. I am

1065
01:33:39.634 --> 01:33:41.796
Ronald Wyatt.

1066
01:33:43.805 --> 01:33:46.013
I want to help you to...

1067
01:33:46.641 --> 01:33:49.884
To release all these new works.

1068
01:33:50.186 --> 01:33:54.931
Now, with your knowledge
of the unknown,


1069
01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:57.812
of death itself,

1070
01:33:58.486 --> 01:34:00.648
Knowledge of death?

1071
01:34:01.239 --> 01:34:03.026
I pray to die.

1072
01:34:03.783 --> 01:34:06.992
To die? Again?

1073
01:34:07.662 --> 01:34:11.372
I sought and found the unknown.

1074
01:34:12.083 --> 01:34:14.621
Made a deal with the devil.

1075
01:34:15.461 --> 01:34:17.373
Eternal life.

1076
01:34:19.674 --> 01:34:23.509
To preserve the works
of Edgar Allan Poe for the world


1077
01:34:23.678 --> 01:34:26.796
is the work of God,
not the devil.


1078
01:34:27.182 --> 01:34:31.768
To condemn a man to a living hell
is the work of the devil.


1079
01:34:31.936 --> 01:34:34.679
And one's soul
can only be released


1080
01:34:34.856 --> 01:34:37.849
if a living soul replaces his

1081
01:34:37.984 --> 01:34:40.146
in the devil's domain.

1082
01:34:43.781 --> 01:34:46.819
Is there no other way
to release you?


1083
01:34:48.036 --> 01:34:51.620
There is another way. By fire.

1084
01:34:53.791 --> 01:34:55.623
I have the means.

1085
01:34:55.793 --> 01:34:57.409
Here.

1086
01:34:59.547 --> 01:35:01.584
But, in return,

1087
01:35:04.385 --> 01:35:07.878
you must tell me more
about the unknown.


1088
01:35:08.264 --> 01:35:11.348
Yes. Yes, I will.

1089
01:35:21.819 --> 01:35:25.403
If you liberate one who has made
a pact with the devil,


1090
01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:29.108
you yourself become
the devil's slave.


1091
01:35:29.535 --> 01:35:31.447
You are trapped, my friend.

1092
01:35:31.621 --> 01:35:34.284
Trapped. Is that not a good ending

1093
01:35:34.499 --> 01:35:38.368
for the last story
of Edgar Allan Poe?


1094
01:35:59.649 --> 01:36:01.515
<i>You are trapped.</i>

1095
01:36:01.609 --> 01:36:03.441
<i>Trapped!</i>

1096
01:36:11.369 --> 01:36:14.112
No, it can't be.

1097
01:36:14.205 --> 01:36:16.197
What did you see?

1098
01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:18.949
I can't believe it.

1099
01:36:19.627 --> 01:36:21.914
What is it that you cannot believe,
my friend?


1100
01:36:22.672 --> 01:36:24.129
You.

1101
01:36:24.507 --> 01:36:26.339
It really is.

1102
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:30.962
What do you mean?

1103
01:36:33.933 --> 01:36:36.300
You know what he saw?

1104
01:36:37.145 --> 01:36:38.431
Who are you?

1105
01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:40.312
Me?

1106
01:36:40.565 --> 01:36:43.103
My name is Diabolo, my friend.

1107
01:36:43.192 --> 01:36:45.354
Dr Diabolo.

1108
01:36:45.737 --> 01:36:48.104
I'm very well known
for my excursions


1109
01:36:48.281 --> 01:36:51.649
into the unexplored regions
of the mind.


1110
01:36:52.201 --> 01:36:53.942
Now let's see who's next.
Who is...?


1111
01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:57.329
- Why, you are, of course, aren't you?
- No, not me.


1112
01:36:57.665 --> 01:37:00.578
Oh, yes. You've paid your money.
You're gonna receive full value, sir.


1113
01:37:00.793 --> 01:37:02.785
No. I came in here to see...

1114
01:37:02.962 --> 01:37:05.921
There's something going on
I don't wanna know anything about.


1115
01:37:06.007 --> 01:37:08.294
I don't care whether you
want to know about it!


1116
01:37:08.384 --> 01:37:11.798
You are going to face that sibyl
and look into the future.


1117
01:37:11.888 --> 01:37:14.346
- I won't!
- You are going to do what I tell you.


1118
01:37:14.557 --> 01:37:16.344
- You are going to do...
- It's you. You're mad.


1119
01:37:16.476 --> 01:37:18.138
Mad!

1120
01:37:19.062 --> 01:37:21.896
But you're not gonna
get away with it.


1121
01:37:22.732 --> 01:37:24.894
Because I'm going to kill you.

1122
01:37:24.984 --> 01:37:26.566
I'm gonna kill you!

1123
01:37:37.455 --> 01:37:39.572
Come on, let's get out of here.

1124
01:38:09.529 --> 01:38:11.521
You were great tonight.

1125
01:38:11.906 --> 01:38:14.319
We gave them a good show
for their money.


1126
01:38:15.284 --> 01:38:17.571
A show that money
couldn't buy, Doctor.


1127
01:38:23.084 --> 01:38:26.202
Well, I've gotta get outside.

1128
01:38:26.421 --> 01:38:28.959
Gotta get ready
for the next performance.


1129
01:38:29.757 --> 01:38:33.717
So you decided to wait,
eh, Mr Wyatt?


1130
01:38:34.178 --> 01:38:36.135
I was interested in, er...

1131
01:38:36.389 --> 01:38:37.925
Making a deal with me too?

1132
01:38:44.147 --> 01:38:45.979
Oh, yes.

1133
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:49.684
Yes, I think so.

1134
01:38:50.445 --> 01:38:52.311
At the right time.

1135
01:38:53.322 --> 01:38:55.154
Do you have a light?

1136
01:39:38.326 --> 01:39:42.286
Of course, I lose one or two
along the line this way,


1137
01:39:42.455 --> 01:39:44.663
but it's great for the sport.

1138
01:39:44.832 --> 01:39:47.324
And it's only fair, you know,

1139
01:39:47.668 --> 01:39:50.502
to give them a chance
to escape my domain.


1140
01:39:53.007 --> 01:39:55.374
But will you?

1141
01:39:59.847 --> 01:40:06.014
