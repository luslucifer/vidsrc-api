00:02:51.918 --> 00:02:53.718
Tell me it ain't true.

2
00:02:56.022 --> 00:02:57.456
It sounds really nice, Ratsy.

3
00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:58.824
Just, if it gets loud in here

4
00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:01.092
turn it up
in the monitors for me.


5
00:03:01.094 --> 00:03:02.160
Thank you.

6
00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:05.130
-What's up, ash?
-Oh, "what's up?"


7
00:03:05.132 --> 00:03:07.466
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm so sorry.


8
00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:08.733
I really am.
I wanted to tell you--


9
00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.135
I've-I've dedicated
my entire life


10
00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:11.636
to making you the biggest star

11
00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:12.737
on the face of the planet.

12
00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.606
You just can't quit now.

13
00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:17.576
Well, you got a responsibility,
not just to me but to your fans.


14
00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:19.110
-Have you thought about them?
-Mm-hmm.


15
00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:20.679
You're their everything.

16
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.747
You're their life.

17
00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.149
Is this because
of the last album?


18
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:26.485
This is not because
of the last album.


19
00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:28.119
They've had 20 years.

20
00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:32.624
I don't care
about selling out stadiums.


21
00:03:32.626 --> 00:03:35.093
I don't wanna book
year long tours.


22
00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:36.795
My priorities are changing.

23
00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:38.897
You're gonna get used to it.
You're gonna like it.


24
00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.600
Or you can work
with somebody else.


25
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:48.773
Chelsea, baby, you know...

26
00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:51.576
You know, I'm gonna be with you
to the bitter end.


27
00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:53.278
So if you're happy
with the last album, what is it?


28
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.914
-Why are you givin' up?
-I'm not giving up.


29
00:03:55.916 --> 00:03:58.183
I just,
i am taking a break...


30
00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:01.786
Indefinitely.

31
00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:04.022
Because, uh...

32
00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:07.559
For one thing...

33
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:10.128
-What's this?
-What does it look like?


34
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.230
What? How?

35
00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:14.566
I can explain it to you,
if you need me to.


36
00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:16.535
Well, how far along
are you?


37
00:04:16.537 --> 00:04:17.602
Be happy.

38
00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:20.272
I'm five months. Look.

39
00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:22.140
What?
How did I not see this?


40
00:04:22.142 --> 00:04:23.708
Well, first of all,
you didn't wanna see it.


41
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.010
But we haven't
been talking about it


42
00:04:25.012 --> 00:04:27.312
and we just wanted to be sure

43
00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:28.713
you know, after last time

44
00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:30.615
everything's a 100%.

45
00:04:30.617 --> 00:04:31.983
When are you gonna announce?

46
00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:33.818
-Next week.
-Next week?


47
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.986
Yep.

48
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.291
Is he here?

49
00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:41.026
He had a thing.

50
00:04:41.028 --> 00:04:43.929
-A thing?
-Mm-hmm.


51
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:45.864
Mm. Come with us
to dinner though.


52
00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:47.165
We're gonna go
to dinner afterward.


53
00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:49.134
No, three wheels
make a tricycle, baby.


54
00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:50.669
I'll let you grown-ups
have fun on your own.


55
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:52.037
When has that ever
stopped you before?


56
00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.205
-What? You serious?
-Yeah, come with us.


57
00:04:54.207 --> 00:04:56.875
Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!

58
00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:00.211
I guess this is it.

59
00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:03.848
-Yeah, kinda.
-Mm-hmm.


60
00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:07.285
I hate you, bitch.

61
00:05:07.287 --> 00:05:08.787
I hate you more.

62
00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.790
Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!

63
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.096
Hello, New Orleans.

64
00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:25.203
Let's have some fun
tonight, huh?


65
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.302
Yes.

66
00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:08.113
Thank you so much.

67
00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:09.781
You all were lovely.

68
00:06:09.783 --> 00:06:11.282
You know, ever since
i was a little girl


69
00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:13.785
all I wanted to do was sing.

70
00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:17.088
And thanks to y'all,
I've been able to do that.


71
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.891
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.


72
00:06:19.893 --> 00:06:22.927
This exceeded my wildest dreams.

73
00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:25.363
Uh, but after tonight,
I'm gonna take a break.


74
00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:29.200
Next week,
I'll make an announcement


75
00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:30.835
and, and I'll explain
everything.


76
00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:32.704
It'll all make sense.

77
00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:36.408
But meantime, what I wanted you
to know is, is that I love you


78
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.744
and I appreciate you
and thank you.


79
00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:42.213
Alright.

80
00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:45.950
-Chelsea!
-Chelsea! Chelsea!


81
00:06:53.192 --> 00:06:55.293
Everybody, back up
a little bit, please.


82
00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:56.361
Chelsea.

83
00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.732
Chelsea, Chel, Chelsea!

84
00:07:00.734 --> 00:07:03.368
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

85
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.938
Chelsea, get in the car.

86
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.474
Chelsea, it's me, frank.

87
00:07:09.476 --> 00:07:11.009
Frank sharp, frank sharp.

88
00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:12.277
-Let's go.
-Get in the car.


89
00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.412
No, it's okay.

90
00:07:14.414 --> 00:07:16.347
-I got this. It's okay.
-You know this guy?


91
00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.917
Yep, I got this.

92
00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.419
Okay. Hi. Hi.

93
00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:23.421
I just wanted to say hi
before you left.


94
00:07:23.423 --> 00:07:26.758
Yeah. You know what? Can you
loosen your grip a little bit?


95
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.760
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

96
00:07:28.762 --> 00:07:31.096
I'm...Sorry.

97
00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:33.398
I just love you.
I-i have all...


98
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:37.902
I got all the materials,
my materials of you


99
00:07:37.904 --> 00:07:40.371
for the fan page and I got
so much stuff, I was thinking


100
00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:42.874
you know, I should start
writing your biography.


101
00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:46.344
Oh, that's a great idea.

102
00:07:46.346 --> 00:07:49.214
Thank you. If you do that.
Will you send me a copy?


103
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.819
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah?


104
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:55.987
Okay, perfect.

105
00:07:56.756 --> 00:07:58.022
Okay.

106
00:07:58.024 --> 00:08:00.091
Okay, have a good night.

107
00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:01.960
-Have a good night.
-Have a good night.


108
00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:03.995
Alright.

109
00:08:03.997 --> 00:08:05.930
Wow.

110
00:08:05.932 --> 00:08:08.399
God, that was incredibly
dangerous


111
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:10.235
and incredibly disgusting.

112
00:08:10.237 --> 00:08:13.371
I can't believe
you just did that.


113
00:08:13.373 --> 00:08:14.873
I think I can still smell him
on you.


114
00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:18.309
Oh, don't be mean.

115
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:19.778
He's just. He's...

116
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.446
Your very crazy, sweaty, fan.

117
00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:22.914
He is sweaty.

118
00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:24.415
So sweaty.

119
00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:28.086
You sure you wanna quit this?

120
00:08:28.088 --> 00:08:29.988
I'm not quitting.
I'm refocusing my energy.


121
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.857
You sure about that?

122
00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.125
Decision made.

123
00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:35.393
We'll see.

124
00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:47.071
Couple of hours, baby.
I'm sittin' on the plane.


125
00:08:47.073 --> 00:08:49.007
<i>Let me come pick you up.</i>
<i>How about that?</i>


126
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:52.010
Actually, I'm not alone.

127
00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:54.045
Um, I have ash with me.

128
00:08:54.047 --> 00:08:55.947
<i>-What? Why?</i>
<i>-I forgot.</i>


129
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:58.383
<i>I thought we're going out</i>
<i>to dinner so I invited him.</i>


130
00:08:58.385 --> 00:09:00.451
He just broke up
with his boyfriend


131
00:09:00.453 --> 00:09:02.220
and, you know

132
00:09:02.222 --> 00:09:04.189
he's not taking the news
about the baby


133
00:09:04.191 --> 00:09:06.891
quite as well as I had hoped.

134
00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:10.995
And I just, I didn't want him
to have a meltdown or something.


135
00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:13.064
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if he has a meltdown.</i>


136
00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.332
We're gonna be a family now.

137
00:09:14.334 --> 00:09:15.834
You keep putting
that dude before us


138
00:09:15.836 --> 00:09:17.869
you gotta learn to say
no sometimes.


139
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:20.038
I can, I can say no.

140
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.441
Really, you can say no?
Great, please, say no.


141
00:09:23.443 --> 00:09:26.878
Listen, we can have
a romantic celebration


142
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.848
you know, tomorrow or whatever.

143
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.616
Never mind.
I burnt it anyway.


144
00:09:31.618 --> 00:09:36.020
Go have dinner with Ashley.
I'll see you home.


145
00:09:36.022 --> 00:09:37.555
He didn't like that
very much, did he?


146
00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:40.491
He's fine.

147
00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:42.126
You don't have to lie to me,
he's pissed.


148
00:09:42.128 --> 00:09:45.396
-Whatever, he loves you.
-Here we go.


149
00:09:45.398 --> 00:09:47.432
-Hi.
-Hi. Ginger ale.


150
00:09:47.434 --> 00:09:49.167
-Yes.
-And champagne.


151
00:09:49.169 --> 00:09:50.201
Champagne. Thank you.

152
00:09:50.203 --> 00:09:51.469
-Sure.
-Wonderful.


153
00:09:51.471 --> 00:09:53.137
Here is to, uh

154
00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:57.008
your new ordinary
and pedestrian life.


155
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.343
I hope you're happy.

156
00:09:58.345 --> 00:10:01.112
Here's to you being
a jackass about it.


157
00:10:01.114 --> 00:10:03.481
Hee-haw.

158
00:10:03.483 --> 00:10:06.517
Okay, can I get you
anything else?


159
00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:07.652
This is great for me,
thank you.


160
00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:09.621
Okay. Pardon me.

161
00:10:12.458 --> 00:10:13.524
Hmm.

162
00:10:25.437 --> 00:10:27.538
It's really fast.
Is that normal?


163
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.108
Between 120-170 is average.

164
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.443
So, we're good, right?
That means we're good?


165
00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:34.479
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

166
00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:36.314
<i>Have you guys thought</i>
<i>of a name yet?</i>


167
00:10:36.316 --> 00:10:37.682
No, not yet.

168
00:10:37.684 --> 00:10:39.550
I wanna call it blueberry.

169
00:10:41.387 --> 00:10:45.089
-For real?
-No, I, yeah, right now.


170
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:49.928
Actually, she's, uh,
more like a kumquat by now.


171
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.530
Uh, blueberry is,
blueberry is good.


172
00:10:52.532 --> 00:10:53.998
Okay, blueberry it is.

173
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.433
-We did good, huh?
-We did good.


174
00:10:55.435 --> 00:10:57.235
We did do good.

175
00:11:24.596 --> 00:11:26.364
What happened?

176
00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:32.603
Okay, I'll turn on the news.
What happened?


177
00:11:35.174 --> 00:11:37.075
We just received confirmation

178
00:11:37.077 --> 00:11:39.744
that the plane did go down
somewhere in the woods.


179
00:11:39.746 --> 00:11:42.313
<i>We'll have more updates for you</i>
<i>as the story breaks.</i>


180
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:52.023
<i>Authorities have now confirmed</i>
<i>that the three bodies</i>


181
00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:55.259
<i>found in the wreckage</i>
<i>belonged to the pilot, co-pilot</i>


182
00:11:55.261 --> 00:11:58.496
<i>and Chelsea angel's long-time</i>
<i>manager, Ashley gold.</i>


183
00:11:58.498 --> 00:12:00.999
<i>There's still no sign</i>
<i>of Chelsea angel.</i>


184
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:03.167
<i>We'll have more for you</i>
<i>as the story breaks.</i>


185
00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:06.104
Sorry.

186
00:12:06.106 --> 00:12:07.438
Can you tell me about my wife?

187
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.007
Well, from the size
of the debris field


188
00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:10.608
it looks like the plane
came down in one piece.


189
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.244
Which means
she came down with it.


190
00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:15.046
If anything happened after that,
well, I don't know.


191
00:12:15.048 --> 00:12:17.281
We did find some tracks
back in the woods


192
00:12:17.283 --> 00:12:20.351
but we lost them
in-in the marsh. Yeah.


193
00:12:20.353 --> 00:12:21.419
I don't even know
if they're hers


194
00:12:21.421 --> 00:12:22.487
to be honest with you.

195
00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:26.257
Anything I can do to help?

196
00:12:29.562 --> 00:12:31.596
You know, just find a place
to sit down and pray.


197
00:12:56.522 --> 00:13:02.160
Ah.

198
00:13:05.697 --> 00:13:07.765
Ah. Ah.

199
00:13:13.338 --> 00:13:17.775
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, wake up.


200
00:13:17.777 --> 00:13:20.278
-What?
-Hey.


201
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.513
What happened?

202
00:13:22.515 --> 00:13:24.482
We crashed.

203
00:13:24.484 --> 00:13:26.551
-Where are we?
-I don't know.


204
00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:29.287
I don't remember anything.

205
00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:31.255
Someone does not
want us to leave though.


206
00:13:34.426 --> 00:13:37.328
-Help! Help! Help! Help!
-Hey! Hey!


207
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.230
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What's your name?


208
00:13:39.232 --> 00:13:41.132
Evelyn, Evelyn king.

209
00:13:41.134 --> 00:13:43.534
Evelyn.
Well, are you okay?


210
00:13:43.536 --> 00:13:45.870
Just a few scratches I think.

211
00:13:45.872 --> 00:13:47.472
What about you?

212
00:13:48.707 --> 00:13:50.641
-My leg.
-Can you walk?


213
00:13:53.246 --> 00:13:55.279
If only I could
get this damn thing off.


214
00:14:01.821 --> 00:14:03.588
It's too tight.

215
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.691
-Help! Help! Help!
-Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.


216
00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:08.893
Evelyn, Evelyn, come here.

217
00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:10.428
We need to figure out
what's going on


218
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.297
and we just need
to be quiet right now, okay.


219
00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:14.665
Who could've done
something like this?


220
00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:17.568
Shh. I don't know.
I don't know.


221
00:14:18.437 --> 00:14:21.372
Okay.

222
00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:22.406
Hey, hey...

223
00:14:22.408 --> 00:14:24.542
Hey, you look familiar to me.

224
00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:28.813
Yesterday was my
first flight. So...


225
00:14:36.622 --> 00:14:38.723
You hungry?

226
00:14:38.725 --> 00:14:40.925
No.

227
00:14:40.927 --> 00:14:45.363
-You got any news, sheriff?
-No sign of 'em.


228
00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:54.405
If they're out there
and not too badly hurt


229
00:14:54.407 --> 00:14:56.774
we should have
at least three days.


230
00:14:56.776 --> 00:14:59.277
Three days?
No, no, no, no.


231
00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.879
We can't, we don't have
three days, s-she's pregnant.


232
00:15:03.382 --> 00:15:05.850
We're doing the best
that we can.


233
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.754
Chel!

234
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.761
Chelsea!

235
00:16:30.669 --> 00:16:32.003
Chelsea!

236
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.340
Chelsea?

237
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.311
Oh, oh, hey, Dillon.

238
00:16:40.313 --> 00:16:41.879
I-i thought I might
run into you out here.


239
00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:43.481
Who are you?

240
00:16:43.483 --> 00:16:44.915
You with the sheriff's
department?


241
00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:46.884
Oh, no, I'm a friend
of Chelsea's, frank sharp.


242
00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:50.554
I run her web page.

243
00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:52.356
What the hell are you
doing out here by yourself?


244
00:16:52.358 --> 00:16:54.692
Well, I'm-I'm here
to find Chelsea, just like you.


245
00:16:57.729 --> 00:16:59.397
You wanna come out here
where I can see you?


246
00:17:19.017 --> 00:17:21.085
How did you get out?
What happened?


247
00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.624
What are you doing there?

248
00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:27.825
What happened?
Where have you been?


249
00:17:27.827 --> 00:17:31.395
Oh, here.
Here, let me help you.


250
00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:36.667
Where did you find the key?

251
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:38.669
-Uh!
-Evelyn?


252
00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:40.338
Come on. Up, up.

253
00:17:42.007 --> 00:17:44.041
After you went to sleep,
i went back to my bedding


254
00:17:44.043 --> 00:17:46.010
and I found it was just
lying there on the floor.


255
00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.113
Isn't it lucky?

256
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.551
Why would someone
just leave it there?


257
00:17:53.553 --> 00:17:55.353
Who knows?

258
00:17:55.355 --> 00:17:58.489
Oh, you thirsty? I found
some water in the kitchen.


259
00:18:06.932 --> 00:18:08.699
Where did you go?

260
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:10.768
Oh, I went to look around
the house. It's empty.


261
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.470
I couldn't find
any phones either.


262
00:18:13.972 --> 00:18:15.606
-Did you go outside at all?
-Yeah.


263
00:18:15.608 --> 00:18:18.075
There's nothing
but trees and bushes.


264
00:18:18.077 --> 00:18:21.011
Alright, we need to go
get help.


265
00:18:21.013 --> 00:18:23.781
No, we need to go now
before he comes back.


266
00:18:23.783 --> 00:18:26.584
-Who?
-Whoever put us here.


267
00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:28.552
You can't go outside.
What if he's out there?


268
00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:30.488
-You don't know.
-I don't care.


269
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.690
Sit down.
Can't you see you're hurt?


270
00:18:32.692 --> 00:18:34.859
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Hobble around in the dark?


271
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:37.027
-I need to get to a doctor.
-Well, okay.


272
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:38.396
Look.

273
00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.167
I need to get to a doctor.

274
00:18:43.169 --> 00:18:46.971
Okay. Okay.
It's gonna be okay.


275
00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:05.523
That's an old one.

276
00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:07.591
I used to be a fan.

277
00:19:12.998 --> 00:19:15.032
Well, see,
i told you we'd be fine.


278
00:19:15.034 --> 00:19:16.834
Don't move,
I'll be right back.


279
00:19:16.836 --> 00:19:19.003
Wait, wait, wait.
Be careful, okay?


280
00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:20.204
Okay.

281
00:19:38.056 --> 00:19:39.490
-They found us.
-What?


282
00:19:39.492 --> 00:19:40.758
-Yeah.
-What are you...


283
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.992
-Who, the cops?
-No, the neighbor.


284
00:19:41.994 --> 00:19:43.494
He saw me walking
around the woods


285
00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:45.496
and he came to see
if we're alright.


286
00:19:45.498 --> 00:19:47.665
I told him about our situation.
He's gonna go call for help.


287
00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:50.801
-Oh, my god. Oh, god.
-Yeah. Yeah.


288
00:19:50.803 --> 00:19:52.570
Where are we? Did he say?

289
00:19:52.572 --> 00:19:55.506
Yeah, it seems we're just
a few miles away from the crash.


290
00:19:55.508 --> 00:19:57.041
-He knew about the crash?
-Yeah.


291
00:19:57.043 --> 00:19:59.944
Did he know about the others?

292
00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:01.712
I'm so sorry.

293
00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:06.550
He said that
they're all dead.


294
00:20:10.989 --> 00:20:12.523
Oh, Jesus.

295
00:20:17.829 --> 00:20:19.630
He didn't have a phone
or anything?


296
00:20:19.632 --> 00:20:21.131
Oh, my god, I...

297
00:20:21.133 --> 00:20:23.801
I was so excited
i didn't even ask. I'll...


298
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.937
Wait, where are you going?

299
00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:28.806
I'm just gonna go see
if I can catch up to him.


300
00:20:28.808 --> 00:20:32.243
That's okay.
Just, just stay with me.


301
00:20:32.245 --> 00:20:33.911
I'll be right back, I promise.

302
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.214
Okay, be safe.

303
00:20:37.216 --> 00:20:38.516
I will.

304
00:20:55.267 --> 00:20:57.101
I'm sorry, he got away.

305
00:20:57.103 --> 00:20:58.769
Are you hungry?
I found this in the kitchen.


306
00:21:00.305 --> 00:21:02.273
Thanks.

307
00:21:05.043 --> 00:21:06.577
Uh, how's your leg?

308
00:21:06.579 --> 00:21:08.646
-Not good.
-Let me see.


309
00:21:08.648 --> 00:21:11.682
Okay. Well, okay...
Can you see it?


310
00:21:11.684 --> 00:21:13.584
Yeah. Oh, you're gonna
need some stitches.


311
00:21:13.586 --> 00:21:16.186
-Yeah.
-Oh, I'm sorry.


312
00:21:17.889 --> 00:21:19.790
It's not your fault.

313
00:21:21.593 --> 00:21:22.660
Here.

314
00:21:22.662 --> 00:21:24.562
Oh, no thanks, I'm fine.

315
00:21:24.564 --> 00:21:26.196
Come on. Have half.

316
00:21:26.198 --> 00:21:28.299
No, no, I ate something
downstairs.


317
00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:31.902
Hmm.

318
00:21:34.039 --> 00:21:36.206
I still, I just don't understand
how we got here.


319
00:21:36.208 --> 00:21:38.809
Well, that doesn't matter
anymore, does it?


320
00:21:38.811 --> 00:21:40.978
I mean, all that matters
is that we survived


321
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.147
and we have a new
chance at life.


322
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:45.316
Maybe you can use this
to relaunch your career.


323
00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:50.020
It's the last thing
on my mind.


324
00:21:50.022 --> 00:21:51.889
I just want a hot shower.

325
00:21:51.891 --> 00:21:53.290
Oh, there's a bathroom here.

326
00:21:53.292 --> 00:21:55.693
Do you want,
maybe I can carry you over?


327
00:21:55.695 --> 00:21:56.961
I will wait.

328
00:21:58.997 --> 00:22:00.764
You should seriously
consider it though.


329
00:22:02.634 --> 00:22:03.934
The shower?

330
00:22:03.936 --> 00:22:06.770
No. Your music.

331
00:22:06.772 --> 00:22:09.807
After this, I'm sure people
would wanna hear from you again.


332
00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:11.141
Most people don't value
what they have


333
00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:12.810
until they think
they may have lost it.


334
00:22:14.946 --> 00:22:17.915
You said
you used to be a fan.


335
00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:20.017
I don't like
the direction you've taken.


336
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.687
In what way?

337
00:22:23.689 --> 00:22:26.123
You know, your songs,
they used to be passionate


338
00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:29.760
and exciting and they, they took
you out of your problems and...


339
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:32.863
I don't know,
now they're sad.


340
00:22:34.733 --> 00:22:37.101
Uh, what, are you depressed
or something?


341
00:22:37.103 --> 00:22:38.769
Just how I felt
when I was writing 'em.


342
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:40.738
Yeah, but that's the problem.

343
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.340
Art is about uplifting people.

344
00:22:43.342 --> 00:22:45.209
And no one wants to hear
about your sadness.


345
00:22:45.211 --> 00:22:46.977
Most people aren't happy,
they're miserable


346
00:22:46.979 --> 00:22:48.679
and they need something
to keep us going.


347
00:22:48.681 --> 00:22:51.815
Your songs did that for me
but now they don't.


348
00:22:51.817 --> 00:22:53.984
Sorry.

349
00:22:53.986 --> 00:22:55.052
You can't please everyone,
right?


350
00:22:55.054 --> 00:22:57.154
No, you can. You...

351
00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:03.961
I'm just gonna go downstairs
and wait for the paramedics.


352
00:23:03.963 --> 00:23:06.230
Just yell
if you need something.


353
00:23:06.232 --> 00:23:08.932
No, no. I'm sorry.
Was that rude?


354
00:23:08.934 --> 00:23:11.368
Look, it's not your fault.

355
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.003
It's just the situation.

356
00:23:39.264 --> 00:23:41.965
Can you stop that, Evelyn?
You're making me nervous.


357
00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:44.168
My mother taught me
that you always


358
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.936
have to keep your things
in order.


359
00:23:45.938 --> 00:23:48.439
An organized mind requires
an organized life.


360
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:50.708
You should try it sometime.

361
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.376
We just had a plane crash.

362
00:23:52.378 --> 00:23:54.812
And we're in someone's house
in the middle of the woods.


363
00:23:54.814 --> 00:23:56.013
I think it's okay.

364
00:23:56.015 --> 00:23:57.781
Okay, why are you so cynical?

365
00:23:57.783 --> 00:23:59.383
All you've done
since I've met you is whine.


366
00:23:59.385 --> 00:24:02.352
I just don't understand
what's taking so long.


367
00:24:02.354 --> 00:24:05.022
-Be patient.
-We've been waiting all night.


368
00:24:05.024 --> 00:24:06.290
We waited all, that's it.

369
00:24:06.292 --> 00:24:07.758
They should have been here
hours ago.


370
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.228
I'm leaving. Ah.

371
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.063
Are you gonna help me
or not?


372
00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:15.299
-No, sit down.
-Let's go. Come on.


373
00:24:15.301 --> 00:24:16.800
No, sit back down!

374
00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:26.310
-Evelyn?
-Hmm.


375
00:24:29.147 --> 00:24:30.814
-What?
-Did you do this?


376
00:24:33.818 --> 00:24:35.419
No.

377
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:36.987
No, it's not like that.

378
00:24:36.989 --> 00:24:39.156
It's not what you think. I...

379
00:24:40.825 --> 00:24:43.761
I, I saved your life.

380
00:24:43.763 --> 00:24:46.130
So you, you chained me up?

381
00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:49.399
I was afraid that you'd
wander off and hurt your leg


382
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:50.868
while I was asleep so...

383
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.369
You've been lying to me?

384
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:55.506
I didn't, I wanted to tell you
but i-i-i panicked.


385
00:24:57.776 --> 00:24:59.510
Are the paramedics coming?

386
00:24:59.512 --> 00:25:01.979
Please, just give me
a chance to explain.


387
00:25:01.981 --> 00:25:04.815
Yes, please explain.

388
00:25:08.052 --> 00:25:09.953
You remember how you said...

389
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.424
That you thought
i looked familiar?


390
00:25:21.966 --> 00:25:24.034
I'm your spiritual twin,
Chelsea.


391
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.143
I'm your soulmate.

392
00:25:35.113 --> 00:25:36.580
What is going on?

393
00:25:36.582 --> 00:25:38.816
Don't you recognize me?

394
00:25:38.818 --> 00:25:40.450
I'm angel twin '91.

395
00:25:45.056 --> 00:25:46.490
We grew up together
in Mooresville.


396
00:25:46.492 --> 00:25:48.492
We used to be best friends.

397
00:25:48.494 --> 00:25:50.093
The problem is they put
a chip in your head


398
00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:51.562
to erase me from your memory.

399
00:25:51.564 --> 00:25:53.864
I used to have one too
but my mother removed it.


400
00:25:56.835 --> 00:25:59.436
Why would they wanna
erase you from my memory?


401
00:25:59.438 --> 00:26:01.138
'Cause I wanna
save you from them.


402
00:26:03.274 --> 00:26:04.942
Who are you saving me from?

403
00:26:04.944 --> 00:26:06.543
From them.

404
00:26:06.545 --> 00:26:09.980
From, from your boyfriend,
your manager, your parents.


405
00:26:09.982 --> 00:26:11.348
They, all of them.
They are in it together.


406
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.850
They wanna keep you
all for themselves


407
00:26:12.852 --> 00:26:14.952
but I won't let them.

408
00:26:14.954 --> 00:26:17.287
I'm not gonna lose you.

409
00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:20.224
Did you crash the plane?

410
00:26:20.226 --> 00:26:21.558
I didn't mean for you
to get hurt.


411
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.393
But the storm,
it made everything harder.


412
00:26:23.395 --> 00:26:26.463
Just give me a chance. I, I,
you'll see it's for the best.


413
00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:28.198
-Okay.
-Yeah. Okay, it's okay.


414
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.067
-It's all okay, okay?
-Okay.


415
00:26:30.069 --> 00:26:33.971
So listen, so now
it's time to take me home.


416
00:26:33.973 --> 00:26:36.006
So let's get me to a doctor,
come on.


417
00:26:36.008 --> 00:26:37.140
-Yeah, you can.
-No, I can't.


418
00:26:37.142 --> 00:26:38.542
Yeah, you can.
Let's help me.


419
00:26:38.544 --> 00:26:40.244
-I can't!
-Let's help me get to a doctor.


420
00:26:40.246 --> 00:26:42.646
I can't! Can't you see,
i did all of this for you?


421
00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:47.651
Thank you. Thank you.

422
00:26:47.653 --> 00:26:50.287
It's-it's just...

423
00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:52.089
This is not what I want

424
00:26:52.091 --> 00:26:54.591
so please take me home.

425
00:26:54.593 --> 00:26:57.127
Stop! Stop whining!

426
00:26:57.129 --> 00:26:58.896
You're gonna do what I say
and you're gonna like it


427
00:26:58.898 --> 00:27:00.397
because there is no one
coming here to save you.


428
00:27:00.399 --> 00:27:02.566
Do you hear me?
It's just you and me now.


429
00:27:02.568 --> 00:27:04.568
So you better be nice
because if I leave


430
00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:09.306
or if anything happens to me
you and that baby starve.


431
00:27:33.932 --> 00:27:37.668
Sheriff.

432
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.504
<i>We got a call from a man who</i>
<i>lives a few miles from here.</i>


433
00:27:40.506 --> 00:27:42.572
<i>He says he saw the girls.</i>

434
00:27:42.574 --> 00:27:45.709
-Alive?
-Heading out to investigate.


435
00:27:45.711 --> 00:27:47.210
I'll be right there.

436
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.481
-Walter?
-That's me.


437
00:28:24.483 --> 00:28:26.116
-I'm sheriff Cooper.
-Yeah, I figured as much.


438
00:28:26.118 --> 00:28:27.584
What with the uniform
and all.


439
00:28:27.586 --> 00:28:30.587
You must be that girl's husband.
I saw you on TV.


440
00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:32.556
-I'm Walter.
-Thanks for your help.


441
00:28:32.558 --> 00:28:35.425
So, uh, we came here to look at
the footage you told me about.


442
00:28:35.427 --> 00:28:38.328
-Yeah, I got it right inside.
-Yeah. Right.


443
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.230
-Just give me a second.
-Alright.


444
00:28:44.268 --> 00:28:47.637
Here it is. Here it is.
Here it is. I found it.


445
00:28:47.639 --> 00:28:50.240
There. See that?

446
00:28:50.242 --> 00:28:52.209
Look here.

447
00:28:52.211 --> 00:28:55.078
Well, I don't really
see anything, you?


448
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.047
I see somethin' movin'
behind that tree.


449
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:58.548
-Yeah.
-What did you see?


450
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.518
You see, you see two women?
You see people?


451
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.186
Hell, yeah, it was kinda...
Yeah, I saw people.


452
00:29:03.188 --> 00:29:04.454
That's where they are.
They're right there.


453
00:29:04.456 --> 00:29:06.490
Do you, do you know
where they went?


454
00:29:06.492 --> 00:29:08.392
Yeah, that house
on the other side of the bayou.


455
00:29:10.094 --> 00:29:13.163
Stay behind me.
Stay behind me.


456
00:29:41.392 --> 00:29:43.093
Sheriff's office!

457
00:29:43.095 --> 00:29:44.227
We're coming in!

458
00:30:37.448 --> 00:30:39.249
I gotta get that leak fixed.

459
00:30:50.328 --> 00:30:51.795
Are you sure?

460
00:31:01.639 --> 00:31:03.240
Hang on. One more.

461
00:31:08.212 --> 00:31:09.613
I'm full.

462
00:31:09.615 --> 00:31:11.248
Just two more scoops.

463
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.921
And one more.

464
00:31:22.894 --> 00:31:24.861
There we go. Good job.

465
00:31:26.264 --> 00:31:28.398
Now, drink some tea
with honey.


466
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.738
You know, mother always said

467
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.506
there's isn't anything
that can't be made better


468
00:31:36.508 --> 00:31:37.908
with a little bit of honey.

469
00:31:49.187 --> 00:31:50.720
Can I ask you something?

470
00:31:50.722 --> 00:31:52.322
Sure.

471
00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:56.493
How did you do it?

472
00:32:01.299 --> 00:32:02.799
How did you get the plane

473
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:05.368
out of the sky
and get me here?


474
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.671
This isn't just some
spur-of-the-moment thing.


475
00:32:07.673 --> 00:32:10.240
I was planning this
for a long time.


476
00:32:10.242 --> 00:32:13.843
Well, t-tell me how you did it?

477
00:32:13.845 --> 00:32:17.747
Well, I listened
for the nearest Vor beacon.


478
00:32:17.749 --> 00:32:20.850
Got the prevailing wind
and then downwind leg


479
00:32:20.852 --> 00:32:22.819
I fly parallel to the field.

480
00:32:22.821 --> 00:32:25.622
Fed in the flaps,
and in the final


481
00:32:25.624 --> 00:32:28.391
you slow to just barely
controllable VOS


482
00:32:28.393 --> 00:32:30.527
which gets a bit squishy
but we made it.


483
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:33.463
And you stay in ground speed
as long as possible


484
00:32:33.465 --> 00:32:35.865
rear wheels down, you know.

485
00:32:35.867 --> 00:32:37.834
How did you know
how to do all that?


486
00:32:39.303 --> 00:32:40.770
I was in the air force ROTC.

487
00:32:40.772 --> 00:32:44.474
I wrote you all of this.
I became a pilot, you remember.


488
00:32:44.476 --> 00:32:46.343
Sure.

489
00:32:46.345 --> 00:32:47.978
Wow.

490
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.746
I mean the hard part
was figuring out


491
00:32:49.748 --> 00:32:51.381
<i>how much rohypnol</i>
<i>to give everybody</i>


492
00:32:51.383 --> 00:32:53.016
<i>because of the weight</i>
<i>and everything.</i>


493
00:32:53.018 --> 00:32:54.284
<i>It was a bit tricky.</i>

494
00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.622
Why did you have to kill them?

495
00:32:58.624 --> 00:33:00.757
Well...

496
00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:02.659
<i>I couldn't leave</i>
<i>any evidence behind.</i>


497
00:33:05.863 --> 00:33:07.697
In five days' time
when everyone thinks


498
00:33:07.699 --> 00:33:09.366
you've been eaten by animals

499
00:33:09.368 --> 00:33:10.567
you'll come back from the dead

500
00:33:10.569 --> 00:33:11.835
and announce
your triumphant return.


501
00:33:11.837 --> 00:33:13.370
And it will all make sense.

502
00:33:13.372 --> 00:33:14.938
And then we'll drop
your new album


503
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.506
and you'll be selling out
stadiums


504
00:33:16.508 --> 00:33:18.475
all across the world
like before.


505
00:33:18.477 --> 00:33:20.477
What new record?

506
00:33:20.479 --> 00:33:23.280
The one we're gonna
make together.


507
00:33:23.282 --> 00:33:24.414
Oh, right.

508
00:33:27.451 --> 00:33:29.319
Well, I have, I have
a little surprise for you.


509
00:33:33.858 --> 00:33:35.325
What the hell...

510
00:33:35.327 --> 00:33:38.061
-Sheriff. Sheriff?
-No questions.


511
00:33:38.063 --> 00:33:42.399
No questions. Let me through.

512
00:33:42.401 --> 00:33:46.836
What's going on here?

513
00:33:46.838 --> 00:33:48.938
What are all these people
doing out there?


514
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.307
<i>It's been three days now</i>

515
00:33:50.309 --> 00:33:52.075
<i>since Chelsea's disappearance</i>

516
00:33:52.077 --> 00:33:56.513
and if there's anyone
out there who knows...


517
00:33:56.515 --> 00:34:00.650
Is she dead? Sheriff,
is there any evidence?


518
00:34:00.652 --> 00:34:04.754
...for any information that can
lead to finding Chelsea.


519
00:34:04.756 --> 00:34:06.389
Thank you.

520
00:34:06.391 --> 00:34:08.892
You gotta be shittin' me.

521
00:34:08.894 --> 00:34:10.493
What do you expect me to do,
sit around


522
00:34:10.495 --> 00:34:12.429
and wait for you
to find her corpse?


523
00:34:12.431 --> 00:34:14.698
I expect you to let me
do my job like I asked you.


524
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.499
Now, I'm gonna have deputies
answering phone calls


525
00:34:16.501 --> 00:34:19.402
from wackos all day
and still looking for Chelsea.


526
00:34:19.404 --> 00:34:20.770
I did what I had to do
to help.


527
00:34:22.973 --> 00:34:24.841
You talk to press again
and I'll have you locked up


528
00:34:24.843 --> 00:34:26.343
for obstruction of justice.

529
00:34:26.345 --> 00:34:28.712
You understand me?

530
00:34:28.714 --> 00:34:30.513
Do you understand me?

531
00:34:40.758 --> 00:34:42.492
You wanna hold it?

532
00:34:47.898 --> 00:34:49.132
What do you think?

533
00:34:50.901 --> 00:34:53.036
It's you.

534
00:34:53.038 --> 00:34:55.405
Yeah. I see.

535
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.074
I made it from scratch.

536
00:34:58.076 --> 00:35:00.510
I knew you'd appreciate it.

537
00:35:00.512 --> 00:35:02.078
By the way you write
your songs, I can tell that


538
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.047
you're an analytical person
like me.


539
00:35:04.049 --> 00:35:07.484
Someone who pays attention
to details as much as I do.


540
00:35:07.486 --> 00:35:09.819
How long did it take you
to make it?


541
00:35:09.821 --> 00:35:11.488
Not very long.

542
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:13.590
You wanna learn
how to make one?


543
00:35:13.592 --> 00:35:15.625
I have all the materials
right here.


544
00:35:17.027 --> 00:35:18.895
Well, I have to check
my calendar.


545
00:35:20.698 --> 00:35:23.833
Oh, I've always liked
your sense of humor.


546
00:35:23.835 --> 00:35:26.436
Okay, so the first part
is drawing


547
00:35:26.438 --> 00:35:27.937
all your lines on the cloth.

548
00:35:27.939 --> 00:35:29.406
But I already did that part.

549
00:35:29.408 --> 00:35:31.641
So now all we have to do
is cut the cloth


550
00:35:31.643 --> 00:35:33.676
following along the lines.

551
00:35:33.678 --> 00:35:36.045
It's important not to open
and close the scissors


552
00:35:36.047 --> 00:35:38.548
when you cut or you make
these little jagged edges.


553
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.049
It's better to use it
like a cutter.


554
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:42.652
Just slice it through
in one smooth motion.


555
00:35:42.654 --> 00:35:44.454
I'll show you, like this.

556
00:35:48.092 --> 00:35:50.126
-Well, I don't have to---do it.

557
00:35:55.533 --> 00:35:57.066
Be careful, those scissors
are sharp.


558
00:36:08.078 --> 00:36:10.914
No, the cloth is too loose.
Hold it tighter.


559
00:36:10.916 --> 00:36:12.582
-Tighter, I said.
-Okay.


560
00:36:14.618 --> 00:36:16.553
No! No! No! Not like that.
You ruined it.


561
00:36:16.555 --> 00:36:19.055
You ruined the whole thing.

562
00:36:19.057 --> 00:36:20.490
Here, try it again.

563
00:36:28.732 --> 00:36:30.667
No. No, no, no.

564
00:36:30.669 --> 00:36:31.835
Again.

565
00:36:31.837 --> 00:36:33.203
Okay.

566
00:36:35.606 --> 00:36:36.773
Yeah.

567
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.512
Are you doing this on purpose?

568
00:36:42.514 --> 00:36:44.247
-Again!
-Okay.


569
00:36:47.818 --> 00:36:49.719
-This is ridiculous.
-Try it again!


570
00:36:55.993 --> 00:36:57.093
Happy now?

571
00:36:59.129 --> 00:37:00.230
Not yet.

572
00:37:05.202 --> 00:37:06.669
But I will be.

573
00:37:17.214 --> 00:37:19.716
We really gonna have
to take care of that.


574
00:37:35.766 --> 00:37:37.767
Chelsea!

575
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.173
Chelsea!

576
00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:19.976
What did you give me?

577
00:38:19.978 --> 00:38:22.912
Just a little somethin'
to help you sleep.


578
00:38:22.914 --> 00:38:25.014
Why, why am I chained?

579
00:38:25.016 --> 00:38:26.349
Why, I have to take care
of that cut


580
00:38:26.351 --> 00:38:28.885
you have in your leg
before it gets infected.


581
00:38:28.887 --> 00:38:31.054
Evelyn. Evelyn. Evelyn.

582
00:38:31.056 --> 00:38:33.990
-Here.
-No. Listen, listen...


583
00:38:33.992 --> 00:38:35.158
It's okay.
I'm gonna be okay--


584
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.593
this is gonna hurt.

585
00:38:45.769 --> 00:38:49.072
Shh. Shh.

586
00:38:52.343 --> 00:38:54.143
I couldn't sleep
all night wondering


587
00:38:54.145 --> 00:38:56.179
why the hell you're
so damn unhappy.


588
00:38:59.917 --> 00:39:02.819
I wait on you day and night.
I save you from your captors.


589
00:39:02.821 --> 00:39:05.054
And all you do is think of ways
of going back to them.


590
00:39:10.228 --> 00:39:11.961
Be quiet while I'm speaking.

591
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.168
And then it suddenly
dawned at me.


592
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.837
I used to be the same.

593
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.409
I remember when mother
took me away from dad's house


594
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:28.177
living in the car

595
00:39:28.179 --> 00:39:31.314
bathing in the gas station
sink in winter


596
00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:33.816
begging her to take us back.

597
00:39:33.818 --> 00:39:38.154
But she insisted that
that's the way things had to be.


598
00:39:38.156 --> 00:39:40.723
Hold on, hold on.
Don't pass out.


599
00:39:46.096 --> 00:39:47.897
I'm so angry at her.

600
00:39:50.334 --> 00:39:53.036
But now that I'm older
i realize


601
00:39:53.038 --> 00:39:56.806
that all those things she did
would make me stronger.


602
00:39:59.376 --> 00:40:01.010
Just one more second.

603
00:40:05.449 --> 00:40:06.949
There.

604
00:40:09.687 --> 00:40:13.457
I got it.

605
00:40:13.457 --> 00:40:15.858
I'm gonna make you
strong again, Chelsea.


606
00:40:17.327 --> 00:40:18.795
I promise.

607
00:41:21.325 --> 00:41:23.192
How do you like your eggs?

608
00:41:23.194 --> 00:41:26.229
I don't care.

609
00:41:26.231 --> 00:41:29.799
Over easy, scrambled
or sunny side up?


610
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:32.201
I don't care.

611
00:41:32.203 --> 00:41:34.003
Okay, scrambled it is then.

612
00:42:04.334 --> 00:42:05.802
Is everything okay?

613
00:42:07.171 --> 00:42:11.040
You know, I think
i prefer them over easy.


614
00:42:11.042 --> 00:42:13.009
Just a second ago
you said you didn't care.


615
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:16.078
I know. I changed my mind.
I'm sorry.


616
00:42:19.249 --> 00:42:20.449
Okay.

617
00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.364
If you don't like eggs
i can make you something else.


618
00:42:35.366 --> 00:42:38.000
Just tell me what you want
so I can get organized.


619
00:42:43.207 --> 00:42:44.607
This isn't some fancy restaurant

620
00:42:44.609 --> 00:42:46.442
like the ones
you're used to, you know.


621
00:42:46.444 --> 00:42:48.945
You can't just be throwing away
your food for nothing.


622
00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.484
By the way, how's your leg?

623
00:42:57.621 --> 00:43:01.424
It's good. I-i-i think
it's, uh, I think it's better.


624
00:43:30.354 --> 00:43:31.454
There.

625
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:34.523
Eat up now.

626
00:43:36.927 --> 00:43:38.961
Wait, not so fast.

627
00:43:40.964 --> 00:43:42.899
We have to say grace
before we eat.


628
00:43:44.401 --> 00:43:46.035
Oh.

629
00:43:48.972 --> 00:43:52.508
Dear, lord, thank you
for the unborn baby chickens


630
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.210
who were savagely taken
from their mothers


631
00:43:54.212 --> 00:43:56.679
so that we may
enjoy this meal together.


632
00:43:56.681 --> 00:44:00.483
May we live in a way that makes
us worthy of their sacrifice.


633
00:44:00.485 --> 00:44:03.119
And may their undeveloped
flesh and organs


634
00:44:03.121 --> 00:44:06.255
fill us with strength,
health and creativity


635
00:44:06.257 --> 00:44:09.525
curing our sinful minds
so full of sorrow and hate.


636
00:44:11.228 --> 00:44:12.662
Amen.

637
00:44:17.634 --> 00:44:19.635
Never heard that one before.

638
00:44:19.637 --> 00:44:21.637
Oh, I'm like my mother
in that sense.


639
00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:24.206
I like to do things
my own way. Mm.


640
00:44:26.043 --> 00:44:27.376
So, um...

641
00:44:30.447 --> 00:44:32.348
You don't have to be
in the air force right now?


642
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:36.719
Oh, I had a little
medical issue


643
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:39.455
but I'm fine now.

644
00:44:39.457 --> 00:44:40.489
That's good.

645
00:44:40.491 --> 00:44:42.525
-Thank you.
-Hmm.


646
00:44:48.231 --> 00:44:49.298
I have a question.

647
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.366
What?

648
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.472
What do you expect
from this?


649
00:44:56.474 --> 00:44:57.506
What do you mean?

650
00:44:57.508 --> 00:44:59.342
I mean, from...

651
00:44:59.344 --> 00:45:02.278
From my time here.
What am I doing here?


652
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.347
Oh, I told you the other day.

653
00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:06.382
All I want
is to make you happy again.


654
00:45:08.318 --> 00:45:10.987
-I am happy.
-No, you're not.


655
00:45:10.989 --> 00:45:13.456
You used to be a star.
Everyone loved you.


656
00:45:13.458 --> 00:45:15.091
I'm gonna
get that back for you.


657
00:45:15.093 --> 00:45:16.425
-I see.
-Yeah.


658
00:45:16.427 --> 00:45:17.626
Hmm.

659
00:45:19.596 --> 00:45:21.497
Why here?
Why, why like this?


660
00:45:21.499 --> 00:45:23.632
Well, I mean,
what else could I do?


661
00:45:23.634 --> 00:45:25.701
If I would've walked up to you
on the street and said


662
00:45:25.703 --> 00:45:27.336
"i wanna rescue your career."

663
00:45:27.338 --> 00:45:29.305
Would you have taken me
seriously?


664
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.543
Right.

665
00:45:47.157 --> 00:45:49.091
Well, that doesn't matter now
though, right?


666
00:45:49.093 --> 00:45:50.626
And you have my attention.

667
00:45:50.628 --> 00:45:52.194
Mm-hmm.

668
00:45:52.196 --> 00:45:57.066
And we could go record
the album in my studio.


669
00:45:57.068 --> 00:45:59.035
I can see the doctor
and-and we'd be


670
00:45:59.037 --> 00:46:00.770
more comfortable at my place.

671
00:46:00.772 --> 00:46:02.638
No, they would take you away
like they took mother


672
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.240
and then I'd be alone again.

673
00:46:06.043 --> 00:46:08.277
-Who would take me?
-Everyone.


674
00:46:08.279 --> 00:46:11.280
All the leeches
that live off your blood.


675
00:46:11.282 --> 00:46:13.482
If I let you go then
I'll never see you again.


676
00:46:14.584 --> 00:46:16.318
I would not let that happen.

677
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.320
You can't stop it.
They're too powerful.


678
00:46:18.322 --> 00:46:19.555
We are safer here.

679
00:46:22.092 --> 00:46:25.227
Evelyn, you know
they'll find us here, right?


680
00:46:25.229 --> 00:46:27.063
They'll figure it out
and they'll find us.


681
00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:28.464
Not alive, they won't.

682
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.545
That's strange.

683
00:46:42.547 --> 00:46:44.213
No one has that number.

684
00:46:52.656 --> 00:46:54.356
Hello?

685
00:46:55.492 --> 00:46:56.859
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

686
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:02.598
They hung up.

687
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:07.736
It must be a wrong number.

688
00:47:09.206 --> 00:47:11.207
Mm. Must be.

689
00:47:12.742 --> 00:47:14.510
So can I get you more eggs?

690
00:47:15.779 --> 00:47:19.281
Um, you know,
maybe just some water.


691
00:48:00.323 --> 00:48:02.491
Just learnin'
how to work this thing.


692
00:48:02.493 --> 00:48:03.759
Oh.

693
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:05.895
Gosh. I think I didn't
quite get it.


694
00:48:05.897 --> 00:48:07.730
Well, next time
you need anything


695
00:48:07.732 --> 00:48:10.332
just call for me, okay?

696
00:48:10.334 --> 00:48:11.901
Thanks.

697
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.637
There you go.

698
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.176
-Thanks, Evelyn.
-You're welcome.


699
00:48:20.178 --> 00:48:21.510
<i>Cell phone was a burner.</i>

700
00:48:22.579 --> 00:48:24.547
What's that?

701
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:27.616
Prepaid device.
Can be bought with cash money.


702
00:48:27.618 --> 00:48:31.187
There's no way of knowing who
that number actually belongs to.


703
00:48:31.189 --> 00:48:32.588
We asked for
the cell tower information.


704
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.456
We should have that soon.

705
00:48:34.458 --> 00:48:35.958
Soon.
What's soon, sheriff?


706
00:48:36.927 --> 00:48:39.595
A day. Maybe two.

707
00:48:39.597 --> 00:48:41.697
Still that's only gonna
give us the general area


708
00:48:41.699 --> 00:48:43.232
the call was probably made from.

709
00:48:45.202 --> 00:48:46.769
We're doin' the best
that we can.


710
00:48:58.882 --> 00:49:00.616
Angel twin '91.

711
00:49:00.618 --> 00:49:01.951
The-the person
that we're lookin' for


712
00:49:01.953 --> 00:49:03.786
her name is angel twin '91.

713
00:49:03.788 --> 00:49:05.888
She's one of Chelsea's most
active posters on her website.


714
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.723
Okay.

715
00:49:07.725 --> 00:49:10.259
Well, the day that Chelsea went
missing, she stopped posting.


716
00:49:10.261 --> 00:49:12.228
On December 19, she posted that

717
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.630
she purchased a bunch of stuff
from Chelsea's website.


718
00:49:14.632 --> 00:49:16.699
So if I could get access
to Chelsea's website


719
00:49:16.701 --> 00:49:18.400
and then look
at the purchase history


720
00:49:18.402 --> 00:49:20.970
maybe I, I can find
her real name and an address.


721
00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:24.406
Okay. What do we do?

722
00:49:24.408 --> 00:49:26.475
I need Chelsea's password.

723
00:49:26.477 --> 00:49:27.943
I don't have her password.

724
00:49:27.945 --> 00:49:29.812
Well, I've tried all
the typical stuff, you know.


725
00:49:29.814 --> 00:49:32.281
Uh, names of pets, parents,
the street she grew up on


726
00:49:32.283 --> 00:49:33.449
your name, your parents...

727
00:49:33.451 --> 00:49:34.650
Uh, if-if there's something

728
00:49:34.652 --> 00:49:36.385
that's not public,
maybe there's


729
00:49:36.387 --> 00:49:39.521
there's something just between
the two of you that...


730
00:49:39.523 --> 00:49:41.290
That only you would know.

731
00:49:41.292 --> 00:49:44.293
Okay, frank,
let me think on it.


732
00:49:44.295 --> 00:49:45.995
Alright, well,
I'm gonna keep, keep trying.


733
00:49:45.997 --> 00:49:47.730
Well, if you think of anything,
you give me a call.


734
00:49:47.732 --> 00:49:49.999
Hey, thank you.

735
00:49:51.468 --> 00:49:53.002
Oh, yeah. Cool.

736
00:50:18.029 --> 00:50:19.495
Evelyn, what's going on?

737
00:50:19.497 --> 00:50:20.996
Well, it's the middle
of the night.


738
00:50:20.998 --> 00:50:23.799
I told you earlier,
it's your choreography.


739
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:25.834
I found one of your old videos
i set it on a loop


740
00:50:25.836 --> 00:50:27.736
so you can study it.

741
00:50:27.738 --> 00:50:30.472
This was my favorite song.

742
00:50:34.545 --> 00:50:37.313
Isn't it great?

743
00:50:37.315 --> 00:50:39.782
I'll stop by later
and we can try it out.


744
00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:41.583
No, that's not necessary.

745
00:50:41.585 --> 00:50:43.652
Don't worry, you can do it.

746
00:50:44.621 --> 00:50:45.988
Evelyn!

747
00:50:48.092 --> 00:50:56.367
Evelyn!

748
00:50:56.367 --> 00:50:58.067
<i>What began</i>

<i>What if the flight attendant</i>

is the one that actually

762
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:43.045
Well, I guess it's
a possibility, um...


763
00:51:43.047 --> 00:51:45.647
Yeah, well, uh,
let me do a, a search


764
00:51:45.649 --> 00:51:47.549

anything at all.

Evelyn!

768
00:52:04.769 --> 00:52:07.136
Evelyn, I got this.
I remember it.


769
00:52:09.439 --> 00:52:10.472
Can you hear me?

770
00:52:13.411 --> 00:52:15.744
Evelyn!

771
00:52:18.983 --> 00:52:21.049
Go to hell!

772
00:52:30.727 --> 00:52:32.161

773
00:52:35.433 --> 00:52:37.065
Help!

774

Help!

775
00:52:42.605 --> 00:52:45.607
-Dillon, it's frank.
-Yeah?


776
00:52:45.609 --> 00:52:46.842
<i>Look, I found her address.</i>

777
00:52:46.844 --> 00:52:47.876
I'm gonna text it to you

778
00:52:47.878 --> 00:52:49.445
and then I'll meet you there.

779
00:52:49.447 --> 00:52:51.613
Okay. Okay, I'll be right there.

780
00:53:14.638 --> 00:53:16.104
Are you ready?

781
00:53:16.106 --> 00:53:18.540
I am ready.
Please turn it off.


782
00:53:20.076 --> 00:53:21.143
Okay.

783
00:53:33.523 --> 00:53:35.157
Alright.

784
00:53:35.159 --> 00:53:37.125
Let's see it.

785
00:53:37.127 --> 00:53:39.862
-Here?
-Yeah, right here.


786
00:53:39.864 --> 00:53:42.130
Right here.

787
00:53:42.132 --> 00:53:43.632
Okay.

788

So...

789
00:54:03.687 --> 00:54:05.854
What are you doing?

790
00:54:05.856 --> 00:54:07.756
Sit down.

791
00:54:07.758 --> 00:54:11.059
Sit down! Sit down!

792
00:54:19.969 --> 00:54:21.036
Okay.

793
00:54:25.775 --> 00:54:27.709
You're gonna show me how?

794
00:54:27.711 --> 00:54:31.680
When you had your big concert
in New York in '96.


795
00:54:31.682 --> 00:54:34.983
My mother and I drove
all the way there to see you.


796
00:54:34.985 --> 00:54:37.286
We danced and sang in the car

797
00:54:37.288 --> 00:54:39.288
all the way
to Madison square garden.


798
00:54:41.691 --> 00:54:44.026
But when we got there

799
00:54:44.028 --> 00:54:46.862
we could only afford
to buy one ticket so...


800
00:54:48.131 --> 00:54:50.599
She bought one for me.

801
00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:52.134
And she promised
that she'd wait outside


802
00:54:52.136 --> 00:54:54.670
until it was finished.

803
00:54:54.672 --> 00:54:56.805
And it was the happiest
night of my life.


804
00:54:56.807 --> 00:54:59.041
I mean, you were amazing.

805
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.148
But when...

806
00:55:07.584 --> 00:55:09.351
I got out that night

807
00:55:09.353 --> 00:55:10.819
she was gone.

808
00:55:12.355 --> 00:55:14.289
I looked everywhere for her

809
00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:18.126
but... they took her away.

810
00:55:20.063 --> 00:55:22.164
I never saw her again.

811
00:55:25.368 --> 00:55:26.835
I'm so sorry.

812
00:55:28.071 --> 00:55:31.006
I loved you, Chelsea.

813
00:55:31.008 --> 00:55:34.776
When they took mother,
i was so afraid.


814
00:55:34.778 --> 00:55:36.345
I was so lonely

815
00:55:36.347 --> 00:55:38.947
but your songs
got me through it.


816
00:55:38.949 --> 00:55:42.384
You know, they moved me from one
family to the next, to the next.


817
00:55:42.386 --> 00:55:44.953
I thought I would go crazy.

818
00:55:44.955 --> 00:55:48.256
But your music, I could
just listen to your songs.


819
00:55:48.258 --> 00:55:52.794
I could just play them over
and over in my head...


820
00:55:52.796 --> 00:55:54.262
Till I fell asleep.

821
00:55:55.932 --> 00:55:58.333
I don't know. I thought,
i thought when we were reunited


822
00:55:58.335 --> 00:56:00.669
that everything would be fine.

823
00:56:02.105 --> 00:56:03.639
But it's not.

824
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:07.743
And now I understand.

825
00:56:09.412 --> 00:56:12.681
You'll never love me
as much as you love your baby.


826
00:56:15.918 --> 00:56:19.755
I found this sonogram
when I was washing your clothes.


827
00:56:25.662 --> 00:56:26.728
Here.

828
00:56:28.431 --> 00:56:29.898
What is it?

829
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.767
Misoprostol.

830
00:56:31.769 --> 00:56:34.002
What is that?

831
00:56:34.004 --> 00:56:35.937
It's for your baby.

832
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:39.341
Take it.

833
00:56:41.678 --> 00:56:43.278
No.

834
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.047
Either you take it on your own

835
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:47.149
or I shove it down
your throat.


836
00:56:47.151 --> 00:56:49.251
No, Evelyn,
I'm not gonna take it.


837
00:56:49.253 --> 00:56:52.187
No. No.

838
00:56:52.189 --> 00:56:53.722
I tried to be nice.

839
00:56:57.126 --> 00:56:59.995
Evelyn, we can raise
this baby together.


840
00:56:59.997 --> 00:57:01.263
-I...
-You're lying.


841
00:57:01.265 --> 00:57:02.831
No, I'm, no.

842
00:57:02.833 --> 00:57:04.266
I remember the first time
i saw you.


843
00:57:04.268 --> 00:57:05.467
I knew we were destined
to be together.


844
00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:06.968
And the baby doesn't
change anything.


845
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:08.937
No, it won't work!

846
00:57:08.939 --> 00:57:10.706
Listen, it's too late.

847
00:57:10.708 --> 00:57:13.141
If the baby dies then I die
and you don't want that.


848
00:57:13.143 --> 00:57:15.243
It's too late
and then, then you'll never


849
00:57:15.245 --> 00:57:17.279
hear the song
that I'm writing.


850
00:57:17.281 --> 00:57:18.947
What? You're writing?

851
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.952
Yeah. It's in my head.

852
00:57:25.955 --> 00:57:27.723
Oh, when can I hear it?

853
00:57:29.892 --> 00:57:31.493
Well, I need a little more time.

854
00:57:34.497 --> 00:57:36.098
You have until tomorrow.

855
00:58:13.102 --> 00:58:16.138
She's on the third floor.

856
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.806
Stop acting so suspect.

857
00:58:17.808 --> 00:58:19.174
The door's locked.

858
00:58:22.845 --> 00:58:24.212
How do we get in?

859
00:58:24.214 --> 00:58:25.814
They have a card to get in.

860
00:58:42.999 --> 00:58:45.534
I'm sorry, Dillon.
I thought they said 324.


861
00:58:45.536 --> 00:58:47.435
It's alright.
The tenant looked pissed off.


862
00:58:47.437 --> 00:58:50.205
Let's just do this and get out
of here as fast as possible.


863
00:58:50.207 --> 00:58:51.273
I'm just gonna knock
and introduce myself


864
00:58:51.275 --> 00:58:53.008
as Chelsea's husband.

865
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:55.076
See if they let us in
so we can take a look around.


866
00:59:02.218 --> 00:59:03.385
Hey, nobody's home.

867
00:59:16.999 --> 00:59:18.466
What are you doin'?

868
00:59:18.468 --> 00:59:21.236
I'm gonna get us in.

869
00:59:21.238 --> 00:59:22.871
I saw it on YouTube.

870
00:59:31.948 --> 00:59:33.081
Hello?

871
00:59:35.952 --> 00:59:38.353
A little office over there.
You wanna check it out?


872
00:59:38.355 --> 00:59:39.988
What exactly am I looking for?

873
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:42.891
Well...

874
01:00:03.379 --> 01:00:04.946
You find anything?

875
01:00:04.948 --> 01:00:06.481
I don't know,
some vacation photos.


876
01:00:06.483 --> 01:00:07.949
Not...

877
01:00:10.052 --> 01:00:12.287
Not even vacation photos.

878
01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:21.463
So when can I hear something?

879
01:00:23.065 --> 01:00:25.600
How about
give me till after lunch?


880
01:00:25.602 --> 01:00:27.402
Okay.

881
01:00:27.404 --> 01:00:30.338
I'm glad I didn't have to kill
you last night, you know.


882
01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.908
I've invested so much
into this relationship.


883
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.377
It really wouldn't be fair
to end it that way.


884
01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:37.312
Oh, hang on.

885
01:00:46.455 --> 01:00:49.024
Here, I need you
to sign this.


886
01:00:49.026 --> 01:00:50.358
What is this?

887
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.527
Well, I thought
since we're working together


888
01:00:52.529 --> 01:00:54.696
it'd only be fair
if I'm your manager.


889
01:00:54.698 --> 01:00:56.932
So it's a representation
contract.


890
01:00:56.934 --> 01:00:58.233
Okay.

891
01:00:58.235 --> 01:00:59.467
Aren't you gonna read it
first?


892
01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:01.369
Oh, no, I trust you.

893
01:01:02.538 --> 01:01:04.940
Oh, just one more.

894
01:01:06.275 --> 01:01:07.342
What's this one?

895
01:01:07.344 --> 01:01:08.677
Oh, this one's for your baby.

896
01:01:08.679 --> 01:01:11.613
We're gonna give it up
for adoption.


897
01:01:11.615 --> 01:01:15.016
What? Why?

898
01:01:15.018 --> 01:01:16.618
Well, because you're right.

899
01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.020
I'm not a baby killer.

900
01:01:19.022 --> 01:01:20.655
In four months, I won't...

901
01:01:22.024 --> 01:01:24.292
We won't be here.

902
01:01:24.294 --> 01:01:27.395
You have a great plan.
We-we should stick to the plan.


903
01:01:27.397 --> 01:01:30.098
Yeah, tomorrow,
you'll have my song.


904
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.533
And we'll...

905
01:01:31.535 --> 01:01:34.369
No, imagine people's reactions
when we reappear


906
01:01:34.371 --> 01:01:36.671
and we tell the whole world
how we managed to survive


907
01:01:36.673 --> 01:01:38.606
and escape from a lunatic
who held us in captivity


908
01:01:38.608 --> 01:01:41.042
for a whole year?

909
01:01:41.044 --> 01:01:43.044
A year?

910
01:01:43.046 --> 01:01:45.747
Evelyn, now the plan works

911
01:01:45.749 --> 01:01:48.583
whether it's five days
or a year.


912
01:01:48.585 --> 01:01:50.251
A year is perfect.

913
01:01:50.253 --> 01:01:52.320
It will give us time
to wait out your pregnancy here.


914
01:01:52.322 --> 01:01:54.089
And then we can work
on the record


915
01:01:54.091 --> 01:01:56.124
and we can get you
back into shape.


916
01:01:56.126 --> 01:01:58.126
And the new album
will be called "kidnapped."


917
01:01:58.128 --> 01:02:00.729
It'll be inspired by our time
in captivity. What do you think?


918
01:02:00.731 --> 01:02:03.531
I understand the idea,
completely.


919
01:02:03.533 --> 01:02:06.735
I think it'll work.
Whether we're here or not.


920
01:02:06.737 --> 01:02:09.504
No, that's wishful thinking.
Children are a lot of work.


921
01:02:09.506 --> 01:02:11.406
That's why you almost quit
a few days ago.


922
01:02:11.408 --> 01:02:12.440
You know that.

923
01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:14.009
I'm not gonna do it.

924
01:02:15.478 --> 01:02:17.779
Come on, Chelsea.

925
01:02:17.781 --> 01:02:20.749
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?


926
01:02:20.751 --> 01:02:22.584
You wanna, you wanna
wake up every two hours


927
01:02:22.586 --> 01:02:26.621
and-and breast feed a baby,
burp it, change poopie diapers?


928
01:02:26.623 --> 01:02:28.356
No one wants to see
a fat, tired woman


929
01:02:28.358 --> 01:02:30.258
with sagging tits singing.

930
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.459
You have everything, okay?

931
01:02:31.461 --> 01:02:33.028
You're rich. You're free.

932
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.096
People love you,
this is who you are.


933
01:02:35.098 --> 01:02:36.297
Why do you wanna give that up?

934
01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:39.667
I won't do it.

935
01:02:43.305 --> 01:02:44.439
Sign it.

936
01:02:49.779 --> 01:02:51.112
Okay.

937
01:02:59.755 --> 01:03:01.523
Now the song.

938
01:03:01.525 --> 01:03:03.625
-Sing it.
-I can't.


939
01:03:03.627 --> 01:03:05.093
Sing it!

940
01:03:07.096 --> 01:03:09.130
Evelyn,
i can't, I can't do it.


941
01:03:09.132 --> 01:03:11.533
-I have to, uh---shut up.

942
01:03:11.535 --> 01:03:13.301
You think I don't know
what's going on here?


943
01:03:13.303 --> 01:03:15.603
You think that I'm just
some stupid little fangirl


944
01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:16.838
that you can just laugh at?

945
01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.239
Well, let me tell you something

946
01:03:18.241 --> 01:03:20.575
you have no idea
what I'm capable of.


947
01:03:20.577 --> 01:03:23.211
No, I, listen, what are you,
what are you gonna do, kill me?


948
01:03:23.213 --> 01:03:24.846
And then you'll never hear
the song that I'm writing.


949
01:03:24.848 --> 01:03:26.381
And it's one of the best
I've ever written.


950
01:03:26.383 --> 01:03:28.183
No, I don't believe you.

951
01:03:28.185 --> 01:03:29.717
You're a liar.

952
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.465
-Keep going.
-I can't.


953
01:03:43.467 --> 01:03:46.234
I'll rip that song right out
of your throat. Keep going.


954
01:03:46.236 --> 01:03:48.770
-I need my guitar.
-What are you talking about?


955
01:03:48.772 --> 01:03:50.371
I always compose with my guitar.

956
01:03:50.373 --> 01:03:51.806
That's what I'm trying
to tell you that's...


957
01:03:51.808 --> 01:03:53.408
I can't do it
without my guitar.


958
01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:55.510
There is no guitar
so it's just too bad.


959
01:03:55.512 --> 01:03:58.146
You can't make a doll
without the proper materials.


960
01:03:58.148 --> 01:03:59.180
You can't do it, can you?

961
01:03:59.182 --> 01:04:01.249
We are analytical people

962
01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:02.817
and, and the details matter.

963
01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.121
I can't take you with me.

964
01:04:06.123 --> 01:04:08.156
That's okay, I'll tell you
exactly what I need


965
01:04:08.158 --> 01:04:09.357
and you just bring it to me.

966
01:04:11.393 --> 01:04:12.627
Okay, yeah.

967
01:04:12.629 --> 01:04:14.262
And I'll see what I can find.

968
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:22.303
But you'd better
write a damn good song


969
01:04:22.305 --> 01:04:25.440
or I'll carve that foetus
right out of your stomach.


970
01:04:39.889 --> 01:04:42.157
So you're saying that you saw
a car come out of the woods


971
01:04:42.159 --> 01:04:45.326
the night it crashed but you
don't know where they went?


972
01:04:45.328 --> 01:04:47.629
Was there a license?

973
01:04:47.631 --> 01:04:48.763
One second, please.

974
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.433
I'll be right back.

975
01:04:56.706 --> 01:04:58.239
What's going on?

976
01:05:02.411 --> 01:05:04.812
I owe you an apology.

977
01:05:04.814 --> 01:05:06.414
I'm a hothead.

978
01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:08.449
And I know I haven't been
of much help.


979
01:05:08.451 --> 01:05:10.785
I'm not prepared
for any of this.


980
01:05:10.787 --> 01:05:12.854
I'm just desperate.

981
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:16.858
Last night was really,
really rough.


982
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.327
And, uh, I found myself
looking through pictures


983
01:05:19.329 --> 01:05:20.895
that I have taken of Chelsea
over the years.


984
01:05:20.897 --> 01:05:23.631
And I came across this one
and there was this woman


985
01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:25.333
lurking in the background

986
01:05:25.335 --> 01:05:26.968
who looked a lot like
the flight attendant.


987
01:05:28.537 --> 01:05:30.672
And I started
thinking to myself.


988
01:05:30.674 --> 01:05:34.442
What if she was the one
who took Chelsea? Right?


989
01:05:34.444 --> 01:05:37.478
Evelyn king,
the flight attendant?


990
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.380
Except she's not Evelyn king.

991
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:43.318
Look, Dillon,
i think you've been


992
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.352
under a lot of stress lately.

993
01:05:44.354 --> 01:05:45.720
I strongly suggest you go back

994
01:05:45.722 --> 01:05:47.222
to your hotel
and get some rest.


995
01:05:47.224 --> 01:05:49.791
Yeah, but you gotta
listen to me.


996
01:05:49.793 --> 01:05:53.494
What if this woman is not
a flight attendant?


997
01:05:53.496 --> 01:05:55.830
What if this woman...

998
01:05:55.832 --> 01:05:58.333
Is a stalker
who planned all of this


999
01:05:58.335 --> 01:05:59.567
in order to kidnap Chelsea?

1000
01:05:59.569 --> 01:06:01.402
Look, Dillon, I have dedicated

1001
01:06:01.404 --> 01:06:03.938
every single resource I have
to finding Chelsea.


1002
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:07.442
But you cannot go breaking
into houses on a hunch.


1003
01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:09.010
Now, if that woman decides
to press charges


1004
01:06:09.012 --> 01:06:10.979
both you and your friend
are going to jail.


1005
01:06:10.981 --> 01:06:12.480
You don't understand.

1006
01:06:12.482 --> 01:06:15.817
That woman is Evelyn king.

1007
01:06:15.819 --> 01:06:18.953
This woman is some crazy stalker
who stole her identity.


1008
01:06:18.955 --> 01:06:22.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're making a huge leap here.


1009
01:06:22.459 --> 01:06:24.759
There could be a dozen
Evelyn kings out there.


1010
01:06:24.761 --> 01:06:27.562
Who are flight attendants,
that live in Louisiana?


1011
01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:33.401
I'll look into it.

1012
01:06:33.403 --> 01:06:34.569
Sheriff.

1013
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.509
I stole this from Evelyn king's
night stand in her apartment.


1014
01:06:42.811 --> 01:06:46.014
Please, run this
through your database.


1015
01:06:46.016 --> 01:06:48.483
If this woman comes up
as Evelyn king


1016
01:06:48.485 --> 01:06:49.751
we're gonna have our answer.

1017
01:06:49.753 --> 01:06:51.486
Because she...

1018
01:06:51.488 --> 01:06:54.489
Is clearly not her.

1019
01:06:56.392 --> 01:06:59.694
Please, please.

1020
01:07:20.983 --> 01:07:22.750
I'm gonna go get your guitar.

1021
01:07:22.752 --> 01:07:25.787
Do you need to use
the bathroom before I go?


1022
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:27.655
I'm fine.

1023
01:07:27.657 --> 01:07:28.990
I'll see you soon.

1024
01:07:53.816 --> 01:07:55.616
I forgot my wallet!

1025
01:07:58.721 --> 01:08:00.455
-What are you doing?
-Uh.


1026
01:08:00.457 --> 01:08:03.391
My calf is Charley horsing
so I'm stretching.


1027
01:08:03.393 --> 01:08:05.793
-Do you need help?
-No, no, it's fine.


1028
01:08:05.795 --> 01:08:07.695
This will, this will do it.
Thank you.


1029
01:08:07.697 --> 01:08:09.464
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.


1030
01:08:09.466 --> 01:08:11.766
Okay. See you in a bit.

1031
01:09:12.428 --> 01:09:13.694
Ah.

1032
01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.875
-Can I borrow your pen?
-Yeah, sure.


1033
01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.549
-Congratulations, guys.
-Thank you so much.


1034
01:10:46.088 --> 01:10:47.588
Hey, blue.

1035
01:11:01.803 --> 01:11:04.705
Hello, Dillon. Any news?

1036
01:11:04.707 --> 01:11:07.174
Frank.

1037
01:11:07.176 --> 01:11:08.776
Try blueberry.

1038
01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:10.778
Okay.

1039
01:11:13.615 --> 01:11:14.649
Hold on.

1040
01:11:19.221 --> 01:11:21.956
It worked. I'm in.

1041
01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:24.191
Alright, uh, let me look around
and I'll call you back.


1042
01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:04.258
Yeah. Hi. Hello.

1043
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.928
Uh, yeah, um, I,
i ordered some stuff


1044
01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.664
uh, from you
and it hasn't arrived yet.


1045
01:13:09.666 --> 01:13:11.799
And I, um,
i just wanted to call


1046
01:13:11.801 --> 01:13:14.702
and make sure that you,
you have the right address.


1047
01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:40.895
And the address?

1048
01:13:42.798 --> 01:13:45.266
Yes, that's the correct address.

1049
01:14:23.271 --> 01:14:24.839
Here's your guitar!

1050
01:14:27.876 --> 01:14:29.777
Dillon, it's frank.

1051
01:14:29.779 --> 01:14:32.146
I just texted you an address.

1052
01:14:32.148 --> 01:14:35.382
I think the kidnapper's
real name is Monica Gordo.


1053
01:14:35.384 --> 01:14:37.985
I'm on my way there now
to make sure it's her this time.


1054
01:14:37.987 --> 01:14:39.086
Call me back.

1055
01:14:47.896 --> 01:14:50.164
I tried to make this work,
i really did.


1056
01:14:54.202 --> 01:14:57.004
But it seems
that no matter what I do


1057
01:14:57.006 --> 01:14:58.439
you still won't understand.

1058
01:15:03.278 --> 01:15:05.146
Before mother and I ran away

1059
01:15:07.015 --> 01:15:09.116
I got into a fight
with a girl at school.


1060
01:15:10.852 --> 01:15:13.354
She threw a rock at me.
I don't even know why.


1061
01:15:17.192 --> 01:15:20.127
And when mother came
to pick me up...


1062
01:15:20.129 --> 01:15:22.196
Blood was pouring
out of my mouth.


1063
01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:31.539
So she took me home.

1064
01:15:34.209 --> 01:15:36.577
And she grabbed a pair
of pliers like this one.


1065
01:15:40.348 --> 01:15:43.217
And she pulled out
my tooth in the bathtub.


1066
01:15:46.988 --> 01:15:48.522
I screamed.

1067
01:15:50.525 --> 01:15:52.293
I begged her not to do it.

1068
01:15:53.562 --> 01:15:55.296
I-i told her
I'd be a good girl.


1069
01:15:56.364 --> 01:15:58.265
But she told me

1070
01:15:58.267 --> 01:16:01.502
that she had to do it
because it had a chip in it.


1071
01:16:06.274 --> 01:16:08.342
I didn't wanna
have to do this.


1072
01:16:10.345 --> 01:16:13.013
I know it's really
gonna hurt.


1073
01:16:14.449 --> 01:16:18.185
But trust me,
this is the only way.


1074
01:16:18.187 --> 01:16:20.287
We're gonna
have to remove your chip.


1075
01:16:22.992 --> 01:16:25.626
So just open your mouth.

1076
01:16:28.129 --> 01:16:29.363
It's gonna be okay.

1077
01:16:29.365 --> 01:16:31.065
There's no,
there's no microchip.


1078
01:16:31.067 --> 01:16:32.566
What?

1079
01:16:32.568 --> 01:16:35.369
Your tooth must've chipped
from the rock.


1080
01:16:35.371 --> 01:16:37.404
There's no microchip.
Don't pull out my tooth.


1081
01:16:37.406 --> 01:16:39.406
No. Please don't
pull out my tooth.


1082
01:16:39.408 --> 01:16:41.041
-There's no microchip.
-Shut up!


1083
01:16:41.043 --> 01:16:43.210
Shut up! Shut up!

1084
01:16:58.126 --> 01:16:59.193
There.

1085
01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:03.297
There.

1086
01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:08.168
There, there.

1087
01:17:10.438 --> 01:17:13.374
No one took your mother.

1088
01:17:13.376 --> 01:17:17.444
She abandoned you because
she couldn't take care of you.


1089
01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:23.918
That's not true!

1090
01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.185
That's not true.
Shut up!


1091
01:17:25.187 --> 01:17:26.387
Shut up!

1092
01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:29.990
Sing the song!

1093
01:17:29.992 --> 01:17:31.392
Sing it!

1094
01:17:34.162 --> 01:17:37.998
If I give you my song
you'll just kill me.


1095
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.566
That's not true.
You're already dead.


1096
01:17:39.568 --> 01:17:41.635
The song will just determine
if it's fast and easy


1097
01:17:41.637 --> 01:17:43.103
or long and painful.

1098
01:17:43.105 --> 01:17:44.405
Sing it!

1099
01:17:44.407 --> 01:17:46.440
Sing it!

1100
01:17:49.077 --> 01:17:51.045
Sing it.

1101
01:17:53.616 --> 01:17:54.949
Anybody home?

1102
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.622
If you make even
so much as one noise


1103
01:18:03.191 --> 01:18:05.693
I will shoot
whoever is out there.


1104
01:18:05.695 --> 01:18:08.529
And I will come back
and I will shoot you.


1105
01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:20.708
I'm coming.

1106
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.654
Anybody home?

1107
01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:40.461
Hello?

1108
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:45.666
-Can I help you?
-Oh, good morning, ma'am.


1109
01:18:45.668 --> 01:18:47.434
Well, I'm with
the Louisiana department


1110
01:18:47.436 --> 01:18:51.038
of, of environmental
protection, Ldep.


1111
01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:55.109
We're looking at houses

1112
01:18:55.111 --> 01:18:58.212
in the area for asbestos.
You mind if I come inside?


1113
01:18:58.214 --> 01:18:59.780
Oh, I am in a bit
of a hurry right now.


1114
01:18:59.782 --> 01:19:01.782
I needed to run some errands
in the city.


1115
01:19:01.784 --> 01:19:03.650
Maybe you can come back
some other time?


1116
01:19:03.652 --> 01:19:06.120
It won't take long.

1117
01:19:06.122 --> 01:19:08.789
Yeah, I just, I really
don't feel comfortable


1118
01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:10.624
with people looking
at my things.


1119
01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:13.027
Besides the place is a mess.

1120
01:19:13.029 --> 01:19:15.462
At least if you give me
some time to clean up?


1121
01:19:15.464 --> 01:19:17.598
I don't mind the mess.

1122
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.268
I'm sorry. Really, I, i
just don't feel comfortable.


1123
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:23.270
Well, I have a city warrant
in the car.


1124
01:19:23.272 --> 01:19:24.505
Maybe we could call the police
and have them settle it.


1125
01:19:29.077 --> 01:19:30.477
No, it's fine.

1126
01:19:30.479 --> 01:19:32.312
There's no need for that.
Come on in.


1127
01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:35.249
Thanks.

1128
01:20:00.675 --> 01:20:02.109
Ah.

1129
01:20:08.083 --> 01:20:09.650
So you live out here
by yourself?


1130
01:20:11.519 --> 01:20:13.854
Uh, yep. Just me.

1131
01:20:47.288 --> 01:20:50.124
So, uh, how long you lived here?

1132
01:20:50.126 --> 01:20:52.459
Oh, just a couple of months.
I'm remodeling it.


1133
01:20:52.461 --> 01:20:54.461
Now, you know what year
the house was constructed?


1134
01:20:54.463 --> 01:20:56.363
Oh, I have no idea.

1135
01:20:56.365 --> 01:21:00.667
Have you experienced
shortness of breath or coughing?


1136
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:03.604
Not really.
I'm sorry, I really--


1137
01:21:03.606 --> 01:21:05.472
uh, do you mind if I just
take a look around


1138
01:21:05.474 --> 01:21:07.774
and take some pictures?

1139
01:21:07.776 --> 01:21:09.243
Go ahead.

1140
01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.474
What happened?

1141
01:21:40.476 --> 01:21:42.843
Oh, like I said,
I'm fixing up the place.


1142
01:21:42.845 --> 01:21:44.745
Oh, when I was drivin' in

1143
01:21:44.747 --> 01:21:46.480
I noticed there was a-a shed
down the way.


1144
01:21:46.482 --> 01:21:48.916
-Uh, can I go look at the shed?
-It's just a shed.


1145
01:21:48.918 --> 01:21:50.817
I, I don't think there's
any asbestos in there--


1146
01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:52.553
oh, no, all the buildings
on the property


1147
01:21:52.555 --> 01:21:53.654
must be inspected.

1148
01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:56.490
Sure.

1149
01:22:11.773 --> 01:22:13.507
Can you open the shed,
please?


1150
01:22:13.509 --> 01:22:14.775
Sure.

1151
01:22:34.929 --> 01:22:36.863
All clear.

1152
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:45.272
Alright, I hope I didn't
inconvenience you too much.


1153
01:22:45.274 --> 01:22:46.840
Oh, no.

1154
01:22:46.842 --> 01:22:49.509
Just need to do a quick
visual around the property


1155
01:22:49.511 --> 01:22:50.877
and then I'll be done.

1156
01:22:50.879 --> 01:22:53.647
-Okay.
-Have a good day.


1157
01:22:53.649 --> 01:22:54.881
You too.

1158
01:23:15.737 --> 01:23:17.604
-Frank.
-Dillon, I found her.


1159
01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:18.839
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1160
01:23:18.841 --> 01:23:20.374
Yeah, I-I-I took
a look around


1161
01:23:20.376 --> 01:23:22.576
the house and, uh,
she's here somewhere.


1162
01:23:22.578 --> 01:23:25.279
<i>Frank, don't do anything.</i>
<i>Wait for us.</i>


1163
01:23:25.281 --> 01:23:27.347
<i>I'm gonna get the sheriff,</i>
<i>we're on our way.</i>


1164
01:23:27.349 --> 01:23:28.749
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna
hang out here


1165
01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:29.950
to make sure
they don't go anywhere.


1166
01:23:29.952 --> 01:23:31.018
<i>Be careful.</i>

1167
01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:03.917
Chelsea.

1168
01:24:05.586 --> 01:24:06.887
Where are you?

1169
01:24:07.889 --> 01:24:09.723
We have to go.

1170
01:24:56.738 --> 01:24:58.572
Ah.

1171
01:25:02.543 --> 01:25:04.511
Stay in the goddamn car!

1172
01:25:05.947 --> 01:25:07.447
Tracy, you keep him here.

1173
01:25:10.685 --> 01:25:12.919
Sheriff's office!
We're entering the house?


1174
01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:14.721
CHELS... Shelly!

1175
01:25:14.723 --> 01:25:16.089
Dillon!

1176
01:25:16.091 --> 01:25:19.059
Dillon.

1177
01:25:45.586 --> 01:25:47.487
She's in the shed.

1178
01:26:21.022 --> 01:26:23.957
I love you. I've missed you
guys, I truly...


1179
01:26:23.959 --> 01:26:26.793
I can't tell you
how happy I am to be here.


1180
01:26:26.795 --> 01:26:30.530
Um, I think, you...

1181
01:26:30.532 --> 01:26:33.633
Probably know that I wasn't
writing songs for a little while


1182
01:26:33.635 --> 01:26:35.469
and recently,
i found the inspiration


1183
01:26:35.471 --> 01:26:37.804
to finish one
that I had started.


1184
01:26:37.806 --> 01:26:41.541
So, uh,
this is a new one.


1185
01:26:41.543 --> 01:26:44.711
-Whoo!
-Yeah.


1186
01:26:44.713 --> 01:26:47.214
I'd like to dedicate it
to three men in my life.


1187
01:26:48.549 --> 01:26:51.084
To ash, my manager

1188
01:26:51.086 --> 01:26:52.786
who was like a brother to me.

1189
01:26:55.022 --> 01:26:56.723
To frank sharp

1190
01:26:58.626 --> 01:27:00.894
a true friend...

1191
01:27:00.896 --> 01:27:03.663
Uh, who left us too soon

1192
01:27:03.665 --> 01:27:05.599
and to the love of my life

1193
01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:09.035
my husband, the father of my
beautiful baby girl, to Dillon.


1194
01:27:12.673 --> 01:27:15.609
Alright. This is called
"mountain lions."
