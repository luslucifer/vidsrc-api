1
00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:53.509
Look. This is a big claim. The cops
want to nail the guy who stole it too.


2
00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:56.389
The difference is we have to make good
the 30, 000 bucks. They don't.


3
00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.310
To them it's another heist.

4
00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.990
Or, has the owner stashed it
away someplace,


5
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.750
and is she trying to defraud us
out of a lot of money?


6
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.271
If you have large sums
of cash around the house,


7
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:09.632
we would insist on certain
alarm and security precautions,


8
00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:11.992
which my supervisor
would have to approve.


9
00:02:12.072 --> 00:02:16.353
What we usually do in a case like this
is handle the installation ourselves.


10
00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:21.794
Sweetheart, can I get you?
John, can I bother you for a minute?


11
00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:23.955
- I haven't had lunch yet.
- What do you want?


12
00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:28.155
Let me have a cherry cheesecake, a prune
Danish and a couple of Hershey bars.


13
00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:31.236
And I should have something sweet. Let
me have some chocolate-covered raisins.


14
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.436
- I found the missing Picasso.
- I don't believe it.


15
00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:36.196
I... It's at Galaxy Opticals.

16
00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:38.157
They cut the thing out of the frame.

17
00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:40.197
They rolled the canvas up,
and it's in one of the telescopes.


18
00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:42.878
- How'd you figure it out?
- It wasn't easy.


19
00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.879
I'm supposed to be looking
for a picture of a woman with a guitar.


20
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.959
But it's all little cubes.
It took me two hours to find the nose.


21
00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.000
- You should call the cops.
- Yeah, right away.


22
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.081
Would you excuse me?

23
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:58.961
Rosie, would you get me the fingerprints
on the Leland claim?


24
00:02:59.082 --> 00:03:02.282
- Who won the sixth race at Aqueduct?
- Your horse came in seventh.


25
00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:05.243
Seventh? Never bet on a horse
who has Parkinson's.


26
00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:08.163
Congratulations. I heard
you recovered the stolen Picasso.


27
00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:11.404
- Yeah, congrats on the art burglary.
- It was a breeze.


28
00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:13.364
C.W., I brought you something
till your order gets here.


29
00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:15.365
Thank you.
You want to be my date tonight?


30
00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:17.285
- What's tonight?
- George's birthday.


31
00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.725
- We're taking George out.
- All right. I'd love to.


32
00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:22.165
But you have to have me home
and in bed by midnight.


33
00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:24.607
That's exactly what I was planning.

34
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.207
My God, that girl's got
a body that won't quit.


35
00:03:28.287 --> 00:03:31.688
Quit? It won't take
five minutes off for a coffee break.


36
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:34.568
- Oh, Briggsie, I forgot to tell ya.
- What?


37
00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:36.968
- Hey, where are my... Rosie!
- What?


38
00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.009
- Where are my files? Where's my files?
- They're moved.


39
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.970
- What do you mean moved?
- They're all moved.


40
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.890
- Why?
- They're streamlining.


41
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.410
- This is Fitzgerald?
- Who else?


42
00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:01.774
Did you take the files
out of my office?


43
00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:04.574
Would you like to go out and try
coming back in like a human being?


44
00:04:04.654 --> 00:04:08.495
- Did you move my files?
- if you don't like the human
idea, come in like an orangutan.


45
00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:12.535
- That would be a step up too.
- Put them back... now... this instant.


46
00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:14.536
You knew we were
rearranging this floor.


47
00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:18.816
Take my files...
Put them back in my office now.


48
00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:20.937
You had plenty of time
to transfer them yourself.


49
00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:23.698
Fitzgerald, if you were a man,
I would slam you in the teeth.


50
00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:26.818
If I was a man,
you'd be hiding under the desk.


51
00:04:26.898 --> 00:04:30.459
- This is what you do
- when I give you an order?
- Give me an order? You?


52
00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.780
Who do you think I am,
some peroxide little stenographer...


53
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.260
with her brains in her sweater
whose rear end you pinch?


54
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.740
Pinch it?
I couldn't get my arms around it.


55
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.221
I don't take orders from you.
I work directly for Mr. Magruder.


56
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:42.342
We're in the process
of turning this place around.


57
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:46.262
I've been working here 20 years.
You're here six months.


58
00:04:46.342 --> 00:04:48.862
I'm not interested in
your ideas about turning...


59
00:04:48.943 --> 00:04:51.623
Get my files. Put 'em back now.

60
00:04:51.704 --> 00:04:54.304
- Or what?
- "Or what?"


61
00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:58.945
This is the question
you ask me? "Or what?"


62
00:04:59.024 --> 00:05:03.466
"Or what?"
Are you saying "or what" to me?


63
00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:06.426
If you don't get off my toe,
you're going to be singing
castrati with a glee club.


64
00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:10.227
I... hated you, Fitzgerald, from
the day you set foot into this office.


65
00:05:10.307 --> 00:05:12.548
You'd hate any woman who doesn't have
a double-digit I. Q


66
00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:14.468
I'm a good judge of character.

67
00:05:14.507 --> 00:05:17.828
I hate you, and I hate the chancellor
of Germany...


68
00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:20.149
with the little mustache,
but not in that order.


69
00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.069
Be careful when you leave.

70
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.389
Don't let the door hit you on the back
and fracture your pelvis.


71
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.110
So, did you tell her who's boss?

72
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:30.071
Is she kiddin',
talkin' to me like that?


73
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.031
It's 'cause she thinks she's smarter.

74
00:05:32.151 --> 00:05:35.592
'Cause she graduated from Vassar,
and I went to driving school.


75
00:05:35.712 --> 00:05:39.072
Does she have any idea
how many cases I cracked here?


76
00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:41.233
Never trust a woman who
whistles for her own cabs.


77
00:05:41.313 --> 00:05:43.154
Excuse me. Miss Fitzgerald?

78
00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:45.513
- Is that Miss Fitzgerald's lunch?
- Mm-hmm.


79
00:05:45.594 --> 00:05:48.394
- Sorry we're so late. We're jammed up.
- That's okay.


80
00:05:48.434 --> 00:05:50.755
- Here. Keep that. It's for you.
- Thanks.


81
00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:53.115
This is Fitzgerald's lunch.
She's been waiting a long time for it.


82
00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.076
I'll deliver it to her.

83
00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:57.837
You got to come to some terms with this
woman. This thing is only gettin' worse.


84
00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:00.797
What do we need an efficiency expert
here for?


85
00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:03.157
When the old man was here,
this never could have happened.


86
00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:05.518
Thought you were gonna take her out
for a drink, clear the air.


87
00:06:05.638 --> 00:06:08.799
I did. I took her two weeks ago
to Rocky's Bar.


88
00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:11.239
You and Fitzgerald at Rocky's Bar?

89
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:26.162
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem. It's just
an hour and 15 minutes.


90
00:06:26.242 --> 00:06:30.323
- My meeting ran long.
- I... I understand.


91
00:06:30.402 --> 00:06:34.083
We're revamping the offices, getting rid
of that antiquated filing system.


92
00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:37.964
Yes? I can find anything I need.

93
00:06:38.044 --> 00:06:41.685
I can locate it like that. I got a feel
for where all the stuffis in my office.


94
00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:45.605
We're making a central data file on the
second floor. You'll get used to it.


95
00:06:45.686 --> 00:06:47.966
What's the matter?
You look flushed.


96
00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:51.086
No, I'm just...
I'm just a little warm. That's all.


97
00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:53.567
You have all your
business meetings here?


98
00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:58.768
It's near the office. The coat check
girl's pretty. don't you like it?


99
00:06:58.848 --> 00:07:03.369
No, it's fine. Gives new meaning
to the word "dive, " but it's convenient.


100
00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:08.530
I- I thought you'd appreciate
the thick smoke. You don't
have to put on as much makeup.


101
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.091
- What's the lady havin'?
- Tequila.


102
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:13.331
Hmm. Tsk.

103
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:15.452
So, um...

104
00:07:16.852 --> 00:07:19.733
Betty... Betty Ann...

105
00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:22.772
Um, c-can... s-should I call you...

106
00:07:22.853 --> 00:07:26.613
I can call you Miss Fitzgerald,
which is fine with me.
I have no problem with that.


107
00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:30.374
I... I...
Tell me about yourself.


108
00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:34.416
- Myself?
- Your hopes, your dreams, you know.


109
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:37.576
You married?
I mean, obviously you're not married,


110
00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:41.417
'cause then it would not be Miss
Fitzgerald, so you have a boyfriend?


111
00:07:41.456 --> 00:07:43.657
Is this why you got me here?

112
00:07:43.737 --> 00:07:46.898
I just, um... So...

113
00:07:46.978 --> 00:07:50.378
What is your life like?
I mean, do you have any hobbies?


114
00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:54.339
- I have a meeting in 15 minutes, so...
- I-I-I-I...


115
00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:57.020
Not... I didn't mean to ask
about your marital status.


116
00:07:57.099 --> 00:08:00.741
That's none of my business. Maybe
you're... It's a touchy point with you.


117
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.461
You're possibly divorced or widowed.

118
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:07.142
Maybe your husband committed suicide.
I could understand that.


119
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:11.502
Mr. Magruder hired me to streamline
the office, and I'm going to.


120
00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:16.143
But if something is not broken, you know
what I say? I say, why fix it?


121
00:08:16.224 --> 00:08:19.304
There's a reason North Coast has slipped
from the top five insurance companies.


122
00:08:19.384 --> 00:08:21.904
There's an enormous amount
of waste and duplication.


123
00:08:21.985 --> 00:08:23.945
Yeah, not... not in my department.

124
00:08:23.985 --> 00:08:26.985
There's not a single department
that couldn't be run more
efficiently or economically.


125
00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:30.026
I'm not even sure North Coast
wouldn't be better off not carrying...


126
00:08:30.106 --> 00:08:33.067
an investigative division and just
farming out each case privately.


127
00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:42.869
Would it be possible to meet at some
point and have a drink and discuss that?


128
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:45.589
We are having a drink.

129
00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:48.149
Look, I don't think you know
what you're talking about.


130
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.550
I think you came in here
like a steamroller...


131
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.470
You felt threatened by me
from the first day I got on this job.


132
00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:57.751
Not only was I an efficiency
expert and a challenge to your
little state within a state,


133
00:08:57.832 --> 00:09:00.752
but I'm not one of those windup dolls
you can tickle at the water cooler.


134
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.192
I'm smarter than you. I'm faster.

135
00:09:03.313 --> 00:09:06.153
I can see right through you.
You're right to feel threatened by me.


136
00:09:06.273 --> 00:09:10.394
I... am threatened by you?

137
00:09:10.474 --> 00:09:15.595
It's fascinating, as a female
executive, how many men I meet
with a fragile masculinity.


138
00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:17.556
A fragile masculinity?

139
00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:20.796
You make one more crack about
my religion, and woman or no woman...


140
00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:25.117
- I have to go.
- Hey, listen, honey,
- let me level with you here.


141
00:09:25.157 --> 00:09:28.597
Despite all your high falutin talk
about streamlining the office,


142
00:09:28.678 --> 00:09:32.119
what you really need is
a good old-fashioned roll in the hay.


143
00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.358
Ha! You wouldn't know
which end is up.


144
00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:37.279
Well, in your case,
it would be hard to tell.


145
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.680
Don't bother seeing me to the door.
Someone might think we're together.


146
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.601
- Why? Do I look like an organ grinder?
- No, just an organ.


147
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.521
- So the drink didn't smooth things out.
- No, not exactly.


148
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:48.562
You better get used to her,
'cause she's here to stay.


149
00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:52.642
There's something about that broad that
I don't trust. She's got an evil streak.


150
00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:56.403
We got a reservation for 8:00
at the Rainbow Room for George's 50th.


151
00:09:56.483 --> 00:09:58.403
That'll be fun.
We'll split a cab uptown.


152
00:09:58.483 --> 00:10:03.364
C.W. I'm not going to have time to go
home to change, so does this look okay?


153
00:10:03.484 --> 00:10:07.565
Sweetheart, no matter how bad
the economy gets, you will never starve.


154
00:10:07.646 --> 00:10:09.485
Good.

155
00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:15.167
Oh, wait. Come here.
Miss Fitzgerald? Okay, take a card.


156
00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:17.847
You gotta see this, Fitz.

157
00:10:17.927 --> 00:10:19.767
All right, that's a six of hearts.

158
00:10:19.848 --> 00:10:23.128
- That's amazing. How'd you do that?
- It's magic.


159
00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:26.849
- He could do it all afternoon.
- I want you to teach me.


160
00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:29.890
Mr. Magruder, I'll have that report
for you first thing in the morning.


161
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.810
Fine. Are you coming to celebrate
George Bond's birthday with us tonight?


162
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.931
Not really.
I'm up to my neck in work.


163
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.091
Why don't you come?
It'll be fun. George is a great guy.


164
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:39.531
Most of the personnel
here seems very nice.


165
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.372
The only one that gives me
the dry heaves is Briggs.


166
00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:45.493
C.W.? He's cracked a lot of cases.

167
00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:48.053
Of course, I don't see how.
Such a drone.


168
00:10:48.134 --> 00:10:52.254
Gets his tips from street contacts
like ex-cons and blind beggars.


169
00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:54.534
There's something about him
I don't trust.


170
00:10:54.614 --> 00:10:56.615
- Any examples?
- Many.


171
00:10:56.695 --> 00:11:00.135
He's smarmy with those office wisecracks
and double-meaning jokes.


172
00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:02.096
I mean, who is he, really?

173
00:11:02.176 --> 00:11:07.017
He's this shallow,
skirt- chasing egomaniac who's
probably more lucky than good.


174
00:11:07.097 --> 00:11:10.697
Sometimes it's better to be lucky.
I think you're being too rough on him.


175
00:11:10.777 --> 00:11:13.898
It's more that he's just
kind of a schnook who’s more
insecure than anything else.


176
00:11:13.978 --> 00:11:16.018
He's got no wife, no family.

177
00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:19.219
Well, he was married.
Short and stormy. Picked a tramp.


178
00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:21.499
- That's a surprise.
- Excuse me, fellas.


179
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.101
Come tonight.
It'll give us a chance to be together,


180
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.781
and I have the perfect excuse at home...
an employee's birthday.


181
00:11:29.861 --> 00:11:32.982
- How much longer is this gonna go on?
- Not longer, Betty Ann.


182
00:11:33.062 --> 00:11:35.622
I'll be free by the end of the year,
and then we can be together openly.


183
00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:39.663
You love me, but you spend
all the important holidays with her.


184
00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.664
Life can get so damn complicated
when you think it's simple.


185
00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:44.664
Come tonight.

186
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.785
So we can eye each other and steal
touches and play little games in code?


187
00:11:48.825 --> 00:11:50.905
Yes, that's part of the romance.

188
00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:53.866
Someday we'll be able to look back
and know that at one time in public...


189
00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:57.146
when one of us brought up the subject of
Paris, it meant at that very moment...


190
00:11:57.227 --> 00:11:59.787
that we were dying to make love
with one another.


191
00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:03.148
- You're such an adolescent.
- But cute?


192
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.191
- Look at this.
- Oh! Oh!


193
00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:20.312
Happy birthday, George.

194
00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:23.832
Here's to George Bond,
insurance man, father.


195
00:12:23.872 --> 00:12:27.673
- Amateur magician.
- Please, no card tricks tonight, huh?


196
00:12:27.752 --> 00:12:30.033
- Happy 50th, George.
- Thank you.


197
00:12:30.113 --> 00:12:33.393
Everyone, I'd like to make
a toast to C.W. Briggs.


198
00:12:33.474 --> 00:12:37.595
Thanks to you, the police now have
the stolen Picasso in their possession.


199
00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:39.515
- Attaboy, C.W.
- C.W.!


200
00:12:39.555 --> 00:12:42.556
By the way, where'd you come up with
the idea of looking in the telescope?


201
00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:46.436
What I do is I put myself
in the criminal's position.


202
00:12:46.556 --> 00:12:49.997
I try and anticipate what would he
do next, what his next move would be.


203
00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:53.238
- I think like him.
- That's fantastic.


204
00:12:53.318 --> 00:12:55.278
I would hate to have me after me.

205
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.439
Very good, very good.

206
00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:01.839
What are you thinking, Mr. Magruder?
You look lost in reverie.


207
00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:04.880
Sorry. I was thinking about
a column I read in the paper...


208
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.280
about all these Germans occupying Paris.

209
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:10.361
- Yeah, it doesn't look good.
- C.W., you ever been to Paris?


210
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:12.481
I've never been out of the country.

211
00:13:12.562 --> 00:13:16.563
Zero- dash-six, eight-dash-five,

212
00:13:16.682 --> 00:13:18.522
eight, five, seven.

213
00:13:18.603 --> 00:13:21.963
That's right. That's exactly correct.

214
00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:27.844
And now for something I call
the power of the Jade Scorpion.


215
00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:30.325
For this I'll need a few victims...

216
00:13:30.405 --> 00:13:33.885
I mean, volunteers from the audience
and help from a few nice people.


217
00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:36.966
- Oh, yes.
- Go on.


218
00:13:37.046 --> 00:13:39.246
- Sir?
- We got another one. C.W.!


219
00:13:39.327 --> 00:13:42.088
- Go ahead.
- We got another one forya.


220
00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:44.727
There's a sucker born every minute.

221
00:13:44.808 --> 00:13:48.608
- Represent us well, Briggs.
- Many years ago...


222
00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:54.370
an emperor in China received as a gift
this precious pendant...


223
00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:57.290
a Jade Scorpion.

224
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.971
It was said to possess
extraordinary powers...


225
00:14:00.051 --> 00:14:02.731
the power to darken men's minds.

226
00:14:02.812 --> 00:14:05.812
I can't get hypnotized.
I'm not a good subject.


227
00:14:05.892 --> 00:14:08.052
Eyes only on the scorpion, please.

228
00:14:08.092 --> 00:14:09.132
Ears open only
to the sound of my voice.


229
00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:10.013
Ears open only
to the sound of my voice.


230
00:14:10.092 --> 00:14:12.333
Please, sir.
Sir, look at the scorpion.


231
00:14:12.414 --> 00:14:15.694
The surrender of the mind-

232
00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:19.414
The surrender
of the mind...


233
00:14:19.495 --> 00:14:23.535
They resist and resist,

234
00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:27.176
but the scorpion likes resistance.

235
00:14:27.256 --> 00:14:30.536
What is your name, sir?

236
00:14:30.617 --> 00:14:32.537
C.W. Briggs.

237
00:14:32.657 --> 00:14:34.978
What do you do, Mr. Briggs?

238
00:14:35.057 --> 00:14:37.498
I'm an insurance investigator...

239
00:14:37.618 --> 00:14:41.619
for North Coast Casualty
and Fidelity of New York.


240
00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:44.860
- What is your name, miss?
- Betty Ann Fitzgerald.


241
00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:47.900
I also work at North Coast.

242
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.821
- So you work together?
- I can't stand her.


243
00:14:50.901 --> 00:14:52.741
Oh, come now.

244
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:54.662
Don't pay attention to him.

245
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.503
He's a sleazy little megalomaniac
who's frightened of women.


246
00:14:58.582 --> 00:15:00.462
Enough. Sleep.

247
00:15:00.543 --> 00:15:02.583
Silence.

248
00:15:02.703 --> 00:15:04.823
You are now at the
first level of trance,


249
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.544
but the Jade Scorpion wants you
to go to the deepest level.


250
00:15:08.624 --> 00:15:10.985
When I say the word Constantinople,

251
00:15:11.065 --> 00:15:13.986
you will instantly drop into
the deepest hypnotic trance.


252
00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:16.586
All resistance will disappear.

253
00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.667
When I say the word Madagascar,

254
00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:21.827
you will go immediately to
the deepest level of hypnotic sleep,


255
00:15:21.907 --> 00:15:24.428
and you will obey all my orders.

256
00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:28.788
Ready now.
Constantinople. Madagascar.


257
00:15:28.868 --> 00:15:33.589
C.W. Briggs and
Miss Betty Ann Fitzgerald,


258
00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:36.949
I now pronounce you man and wife.

259
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:41.271
When I snap my fingers, you will awaken.
You will not know you were in a trance.


260
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.951
You will be madly in love
with each other.


261
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:47.272
You're on your honeymoon
on a deserted desert island.


262
00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:49.192
Maestro.

263
00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:52.673
The moon shines down
its magical glow...


264
00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:54.633
on you two honeymooners.

265
00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:56.674
You're deeply, deeply in love.

266
00:15:56.754 --> 00:16:00.154
Are you ready?
One, two, three.


267
00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:03.235
Awaken to your tropical paradise.

268
00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:11.477
What are you thinking?

269
00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:17.157
I'm thinking that...
I'm the luckiest man in the world...


270
00:16:17.198 --> 00:16:19.678
to have you.

271
00:16:19.758 --> 00:16:22.078
I'm the lucky one, C.W.

272
00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:27.039
I was in love with you from
the first moment that I saw you.


273
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.680
Make love to me here under the stars...

274
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:34.121
- to the sound of the ocean.
- Miss Fitzgerald.


275
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:37.482
Aren’t you making a mistake?
I'm no longer Miss Fitzgerald.


276
00:16:37.522 --> 00:16:41.482
- I'm Mrs. C.W. Briggs.
- Oh! Betty Ann!


277
00:16:41.562 --> 00:16:44.683
- Make love to me here... now.
- Betty Ann.


278
00:16:44.723 --> 00:16:47.844
Stop. Enough.

279
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:52.045
Unfortunately, every dream
must turn to reality.


280
00:16:52.124 --> 00:16:56.326
When I snap my fingers, you will awaken
and have no memory at all of this event.


281
00:16:56.405 --> 00:16:59.206
You will return to your regular lives
as they exist...


282
00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:03.207
with whatever destinies await you, and
let us all hope they are pleasant ones.


283
00:17:03.287 --> 00:17:05.447
Are you ready to awaken?
On the snap of my fingers.


284
00:17:05.527 --> 00:17:08.008
One: You're
beginning to come up.


285
00:17:08.088 --> 00:17:10.408
Two: The memory
is fading completely.


286
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:15.289
Three: The Jade Scorpion
has created the miracle of love.


287
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.609
And four: Awaken.

288
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.610
- How do you feel?
- Still waiting for something to happen.


289
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.970
How do you feel, miss?

290
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:27.371
- I'm afraid I'm not a very good subject.
- No, me neither.


291
00:17:27.452 --> 00:17:30.892
- I told you this would not work.
- Well, I tried my best.


292
00:17:30.972 --> 00:17:34.573
Come on, George. Back me up.
Briggsie, I'm tellin' ya.


293
00:17:34.652 --> 00:17:36.853
You gazed deeply into her eyes
and told her you loved her.


294
00:17:36.934 --> 00:17:39.814
You're crazy.
I would never do such a thing.


295
00:17:39.894 --> 00:17:42.134
This is a conspiracy
to make me appear crazy.


296
00:17:42.214 --> 00:17:44.575
I hope somebody talks to me
like that someday.


297
00:17:44.695 --> 00:17:46.575
I can't bear Fitzgerald.

298
00:17:46.655 --> 00:17:51.376
Speaking of that, isn't it... Should we
be getting home to, uh, feed your cat?


299
00:17:51.456 --> 00:17:54.457
That would be fun,
but I'm getting a cold,


300
00:17:54.536 --> 00:17:57.217
so I just want to get to bed
with some tea, you know?


301
00:17:57.297 --> 00:18:00.818
If you've got a cold, somebody's
got to rub your chest down with Vicks.


302
00:18:00.898 --> 00:18:03.419
- This is what I'm for.
- Anybody rubs my chest down
better bring a ring.


303
00:18:03.498 --> 00:18:05.378
Good for you.

304
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.860
- Good night, baby.
- Good night, Chris.


305
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:16.341
I knew we'd get a little time
alone tonight if you came along.


306
00:18:16.421 --> 00:18:18.301
I'm glad I came.

307
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.471
Hello?

308
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:10.872
Constantinople.

309
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:13.432
You are in a deep trance.

310
00:19:13.512 --> 00:19:17.433
You will fall deeper and deeper
under the sway of my words.


311
00:19:17.513 --> 00:19:20.634
You will obey
my instructions carefully.


312
00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:23.114
You will proceed to
the Kensington estate...


313
00:19:23.194 --> 00:19:27.955
where you will obtain the jewels... all
the jewels... from the Kensington safe.


314
00:19:27.995 --> 00:19:30.636
You will do this
with the utmost secrecy,


315
00:19:30.676 --> 00:19:34.316
using all the information
and techniques at your command.


316
00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:37.037
You'll do it with
great ease and facility.


317
00:19:37.117 --> 00:19:41.118
Then you will return to your apartment,
taking the jewels with you.


318
00:19:41.198 --> 00:19:44.478
You'll hide them in
a safe and secure hiding place,


319
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:47.359
awaiting further instructions from me.

320
00:19:47.438 --> 00:19:50.800
You will then fall into a deep slumber
from which you will awake refreshed,


321
00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:54.360
and you'll have no memory
of anything that has occurred.


322
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.721
You will wait to hear from me again.

323
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.562
Your life will be simply as
your life is until you hear from me.


324
00:20:01.642 --> 00:20:04.682
Remember. You will obey
my instructions to the letter.


325
00:20:04.762 --> 00:20:08.043
You will remember absolutely nothing
that occurred under trance.


326
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:10.163
Is that clear to you?

327
00:20:10.243 --> 00:20:12.124
Very clear.

328
00:20:12.163 --> 00:20:16.004
Go. The Jade Scorpion commands it.

329
00:20:32.248 --> 00:20:34.408
Awfully late, Mr. Briggs.

330
00:20:34.488 --> 00:20:36.328
Hot on a case, eh?

331
00:21:17.537 --> 00:21:19.777
The Kensington safe
was broken into last night.


332
00:21:19.817 --> 00:21:23.258
Somebody got on the estate.
Jewels worth millions, all gone.


333
00:21:23.337 --> 00:21:26.498
The cops don't have a clue,
and Magruder is numb.


334
00:21:26.538 --> 00:21:30.339
I don't understand.
I made that place burglar proof myself.


335
00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.380
Well, tell that to the perpetrator.

336
00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:36.621
We are on the hook for big money here,
so you better get over there darn fast.


337
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:42.301
By now those stones could be
on the market in Tangier or... or Cairo.


338
00:21:42.382 --> 00:21:47.062
Everything, everything...
My emerald tiara and my sapphire
necklace from India...


339
00:21:47.142 --> 00:21:49.703
That sapphire is the most
perfect in the world.


340
00:21:49.743 --> 00:21:52.223
No fingerprints,
but we got a partial shoe print.


341
00:21:52.303 --> 00:21:54.464
- Man or woman?
- I really can't be sure.


342
00:21:54.544 --> 00:21:57.345
I want to interview everybody
that works here... the whole staff...


343
00:21:57.424 --> 00:21:59.625
the butlers, the gardeners, everybody.

344
00:21:59.704 --> 00:22:03.425
- Something's goin' on.
- This time I think your gut
reaction is betraying you.


345
00:22:03.506 --> 00:22:06.346
Nobody in this house is involved.
I'd bet my life.


346
00:22:06.426 --> 00:22:08.987
I want to search the up...
I want to go up... Can I go upstairs?


347
00:22:09.066 --> 00:22:11.307
If you must,
but would you make it fast?


348
00:22:11.387 --> 00:22:13.267
We've had enough excitement
for one day.


349
00:22:13.348 --> 00:22:16.829
Mrs. Kensington, you know
Alfie and I would never...


350
00:22:16.908 --> 00:22:18.989
Lotte, of course not.

351
00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:32.671
What are you doin'
in my mother's closet?


352
00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:34.632
Well, hello.

353
00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:40.473
You're one of those grubby little
private detectives, aren’t you?


354
00:22:40.553 --> 00:22:45.233
A private eye, they're called,
a shamus, a gumshoe.


355
00:22:45.274 --> 00:22:48.755
Oh, I'm... I'm a grubby little
insurance investigator.


356
00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:52.075
The private eyes are romantic.
I- I-I'm just grubby.


357
00:22:52.155 --> 00:22:54.995
So what? You always get your kicks
fondling women's shoes?


358
00:22:55.036 --> 00:22:57.437
Once in a while I'll fondle
the whole woman, you know...


359
00:22:57.516 --> 00:23:00.756
Hmph. You have a fresh mouth.
I'm not sure I like you.


360
00:23:00.837 --> 00:23:05.878
Well, I tend to grow on people.
We could meet later, and I could
grow on you, if you like.


361
00:23:05.957 --> 00:23:08.598
You don't seem tough enough
to go after criminals.


362
00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:11.479
Really? Maybe if I slapped you around
a little bit, you'd change your mind.


363
00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:15.959
- I could slap you back.
- It's starting to sound like fun.
Should we put some music on?


364
00:23:15.999 --> 00:23:20.201
- Why are you snooping around?
- You're Laura Kensington, right?


365
00:23:20.281 --> 00:23:25.161
Yeah, that's right, and I have a
strawberry mark on my thigh to prove it.


366
00:23:25.242 --> 00:23:29.082
- Would you like to see it?
- Maybe later when
I can take the full tour.


367
00:23:29.162 --> 00:23:32.443
Huh. My fiancé
might not appreciate that.


368
00:23:32.483 --> 00:23:36.604
- Yes? Which one?
- Oh, so you follow my life.


369
00:23:36.644 --> 00:23:39.005
Well, I read the tabloids,
if that's what you mean.


370
00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:41.885
So you've seen photos of me
diving into public fountains.


371
00:23:41.925 --> 00:23:46.366
And getting arrested for speeding
and throwing champagne at El Morocco.


372
00:23:46.406 --> 00:23:51.126
And while I'm out living the
fast life, you're hard at work
snooping in people's closets.


373
00:23:51.207 --> 00:23:53.607
Can I help it if they
pay me by the clue?


374
00:23:53.687 --> 00:23:58.368
- Did the burglar leave any?
- He didn't leave any
because he's still among us.


375
00:23:58.408 --> 00:24:02.888
- Says who?
- Says the little man
that lives inside me.


376
00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:06.170
So you're C.W. Briggs.

377
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:10.011
I hear you’re a very sharp investigator
with an impressive record.


378
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:12.011
I looked forward to meeting you.

379
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.412
- They say I always get my man.
- Me too.


380
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:19.172
Right.

381
00:24:19.212 --> 00:24:22.933
I'm glad we could
have this little chat.


382
00:24:23.013 --> 00:24:26.334
- Too bad there's a houseful of people.
- Where shall we go tonight?


383
00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:29.454
Hmm? Chinatown or Harlem?

384
00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:32.374
You prefer jazz or opium?

385
00:24:32.455 --> 00:24:35.656
I prefer the rug
in front of my fireplace.


386
00:24:35.735 --> 00:24:39.816
Oh, directly to your apartment, eh?
You always begin with the dessert?


387
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:43.017
Well, depends what I'm eating.

388
00:24:43.096 --> 00:24:47.738
This will be a very interesting
experiment for me.


389
00:24:47.818 --> 00:24:52.099
I usually prefer more attractive,
athletic, muscular men.


390
00:24:52.178 --> 00:24:55.899
Maybe I could get in a few
push- ups before you came over.


391
00:24:55.979 --> 00:24:58.620
I... What
about your fiancé?


392
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.221
If you don't invite him, I won't.

393
00:25:08.022 --> 00:25:10.862
- Any leads?
- It's an inside job.
No question about it.


394
00:25:10.903 --> 00:25:13.942
- That's not what the cops say.
- They're wrong. It's inside. I can tell.


395
00:25:14.023 --> 00:25:16.063
- Are the Giants playing this afternoon?
- Yeah.


396
00:25:16.143 --> 00:25:18.704
They're playing
the Cardinals in St. Louis.


397
00:25:18.743 --> 00:25:22.504
Call my bookmaker Frankie. I want to get
a bet down. Hundred bucks on the Giants.


398
00:25:22.585 --> 00:25:24.665
- On the Giants to win.
- To win, naturally!


399
00:25:24.745 --> 00:25:26.625
What do you think, to place?

400
00:25:26.745 --> 00:25:29.746
Mr. Magruder? Oh, tilt.

401
00:25:29.786 --> 00:25:32.187
- Anything on the Kensington situation?
- It's an inside job.


402
00:25:32.266 --> 00:25:36.107
- I bet my life on it.
- You bet your life on the Giants,
too, and they're in sixth place.


403
00:25:36.187 --> 00:25:38.227
Can we talk without
the warden being here?


404
00:25:38.308 --> 00:25:40.868
Please, Miss Fitzgerald
is a part of this company now.


405
00:25:40.988 --> 00:25:43.509
We must all learn to
work together in harmony.


406
00:25:43.588 --> 00:25:45.949
What makes you so positive
it's an inside job?


407
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:48.630
It couldn't be that smooth
unless it was inside.


408
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.350
Miss Fitzgerald is suggesting,
given the magnitude of the loss,


409
00:25:51.391 --> 00:25:53.590
that we expand our investigation.

410
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:57.591
- Meaning what?
- I appreciate the value
of intuition to a point.


411
00:25:57.672 --> 00:26:00.472
But we're moving into a decade
of scientific innovation.


412
00:26:00.552 --> 00:26:04.513
Miss Fitzgerald has suggested
that perhaps we might
get you a little help...


413
00:26:04.592 --> 00:26:07.954
by farming out part of the work
to an outside private detective agency.


414
00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:11.154
- What?
- To help you... test the waters...


415
00:26:11.234 --> 00:26:14.034
see if a new approach
and fresh techniques make a difference.


416
00:26:14.115 --> 00:26:15.954
Don't feel threatened immediately.

417
00:26:16.035 --> 00:26:18.676
According to you, I'm only threatened
by women with high I. Qs.


418
00:26:18.755 --> 00:26:20.596
Did you hire a female detective?

419
00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:23.197
North Coast has got to get
with the progress of the marketplace.


420
00:26:23.236 --> 00:26:25.237
There's a lot of money at stake here.

421
00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.437
The more time passes, the colder
the trail grows. You know that.


422
00:26:27.517 --> 00:26:30.718
So if the Coopersmith Private Detective
Agency makes a contribution, then fine.


423
00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:32.718
If not, we're only out a few bucks.

424
00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:35.559
The Coopersmiths?
Those guys are like Fric and Frac.


425
00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:39.120
- They're sub-mental.
- We are moving into
a new decade, the 1940s.


426
00:26:39.199 --> 00:26:41.080
That means things are different.

427
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.080
Do me a favor. Max Baer's
looking for sparring partners.


428
00:26:44.201 --> 00:26:46.081
Why don't you go down to the gym?

429
00:26:46.161 --> 00:26:48.602
You're the only person I've received
this kind of bitter resistance from.


430
00:26:48.722 --> 00:26:53.762
You're a dinosaur with your street ways
and disorganized hunt-and-peck methods.


431
00:26:53.842 --> 00:26:56.803
Please. My father
always stressed harmony.


432
00:26:56.883 --> 00:26:59.404
I gotta go.
I'm working on a case.


433
00:27:03.005 --> 00:27:05.405
Watch out for the traffic.

434
00:27:05.484 --> 00:27:09.446
Don't get hit by a bus,
your body mangled beyond recognition.


435
00:27:09.525 --> 00:27:13.046
I ain't heard a word about any job.

436
00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:16.567
Nobody tried to fence anything
or do any braggin'.


437
00:27:16.687 --> 00:27:20.488
Charlie, you gotta help me with this.
Keep your ears open.


438
00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:25.008
Anything you hear, I gotta know.
It's very important, okay?


439
00:27:25.089 --> 00:27:27.970
Fifty? You must be desperate.

440
00:27:28.049 --> 00:27:33.451
You know where to reach me. Keep eating
the carrots. I think they're workin'.


441
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:41.171
I think Joe said they're
all gone up there, Mr. Briggs.


442
00:27:41.252 --> 00:27:44.652
I'm just gonna check something out.
I'll be down in five minutes.


443
00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:58.815
You startled me.
I was working late.


444
00:27:58.895 --> 00:28:02.376
Oh, 'cause Eddie said he didn't
think anybody was up here.


445
00:28:02.456 --> 00:28:07.337
Well, I'm here.
Obviously I'm here.


446
00:28:07.417 --> 00:28:10.618
- What Are you so nervous...
- I'm not nervous.


447
00:28:10.697 --> 00:28:15.699
Why would I be nervous? Working up here
alone, I didn't expect to see you.


448
00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:19.859
Don't you work late all the time?
That's what they tell me.


449
00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:22.140
What is this, 20 questions?
You scared me.


450
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.220
I'm working up here alone.
I'm filling out some reports.


451
00:28:25.301 --> 00:28:28.621
What are you gonna do, ask Magruder
to take out all the water coolers?


452
00:28:28.701 --> 00:28:31.462
Why don't you make your wisecracks
somewhere else? I'm busy.


453
00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:34.582
I'm outta here.
You know, I-I... Don't work too late,


454
00:28:34.662 --> 00:28:37.022
'cause the bags under
your eyes are getting bigger.


455
00:28:37.103 --> 00:28:40.143
Have a good evening, and
if you find you're going to have
a sudden coronary thrombosis,


456
00:28:40.223 --> 00:28:43.264
you should probably drive
directly to the hospital.


457
00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:50.305
You were right. We shouldn't
fool around at the office.


458
00:28:50.426 --> 00:28:54.146
- He gives me the willies.
- He's a harmless sort.


459
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:21.152
- Hey. How'd you get in?
- It wasn't very hard.


460
00:29:21.272 --> 00:29:23.432
Really? What'd you do, have
your father buy the building?


461
00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:26.392
A small tip to the super
was all it took.


462
00:29:26.512 --> 00:29:30.193
For you maybe. I give the super
a small tip, he spits on my shoes.


463
00:29:30.273 --> 00:29:34.994
I brought some very expensive
Russian vodka, 120 proof.


464
00:29:35.074 --> 00:29:37.914
Don't drop that, you know.
You're liable to blow up the building.


465
00:29:37.995 --> 00:29:42.516
I got bored waiting. There's
nothing to read but detective
magazines and the racing form.


466
00:29:42.595 --> 00:29:45.956
I got a deck of playing cards with naked
women on them. You could've, you know...


467
00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:49.877
Let me guess.
You use it to play solitaire.


468
00:29:49.997 --> 00:29:52.357
I used to date the six of spades.

469
00:29:52.398 --> 00:29:54.478
I love where you live.

470
00:29:54.598 --> 00:29:58.358
It's just what I thought it would be...
a grimy little rat hole.


471
00:29:58.439 --> 00:30:00.759
Oh, thank you.
I'll tell my decorator you said that.


472
00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:02.960
It's the effect we were going for.

473
00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:05.640
You dying to see my,
uh, strawberry mark?


474
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.721
If it's in the same spot it was this
afternoon, I'd like to check it out.


475
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.601
This is truly a novelty for me.

476
00:30:10.681 --> 00:30:13.682
I'm used to pent houses and yachts...

477
00:30:13.762 --> 00:30:17.202
gorgeous European lovers who buy me
presents and sweep me off my feet.


478
00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:21.083
And yet, somehow, I find it strangely
exciting standing here...


479
00:30:21.203 --> 00:30:25.924
in a grungy hovel
with a myopic insurance clerk.


480
00:30:26.044 --> 00:30:30.525
I know there's a compliment in there.
I just don't know where it is.


481
00:30:30.605 --> 00:30:33.485
You gonna take that coat off?

482
00:30:33.566 --> 00:30:36.806
It hasn't rained in
this apartment in 20 years.


483
00:30:40.087 --> 00:30:43.848
Oh, well.

484
00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:46.128
What do you think?

485
00:30:46.208 --> 00:30:49.609
If I happen to pass away
while we're doing anything,


486
00:30:49.688 --> 00:30:53.689
just have the embalmer
leave the smile on my face.


487
00:30:53.809 --> 00:30:57.290
Perfect timing.

488
00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.571
I'll slip into something a little more
comfortable, wait for you in bed.


489
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:05.132
More comfortable than that? What are
you going to put on, Jergens lotion?


490
00:31:05.212 --> 00:31:09.172
- Hello?
- Constantinople.


491
00:31:09.253 --> 00:31:12.373
You are in the power
of the Jade Scorpion.


492
00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:15.694
You will proceed to
the Dill worth mansion.


493
00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:19.454
You will enter and open the safe.

494
00:31:23.776 --> 00:31:27.656
Have you ever heard of an Indian book
called the Kama Sutra?


495
00:31:27.776 --> 00:31:32.097
I'm sorry, Laura, but we're going to
have to postpone our little rendezvous.


496
00:31:32.217 --> 00:31:35.377
- Pardon me?
- I just recalled a previous engagement.


497
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:38.739
I hope you don't mind.
The doorman will get you a taxi.


498
00:31:38.818 --> 00:31:43.499
- I had a wonderful evening.
Thank you very much.
- You are jokin', of course.


499
00:31:43.579 --> 00:31:46.980
I'll turn around and you can get
dressed, and please try and hurry.


500
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.101
- I'm rather pressed for time.
- Have you got a loose screw?


501
00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.861
Tonight was very meaningful to me.
Really.


502
00:31:53.941 --> 00:31:56.142
I'll always think of it
in a very cherished way.


503
00:31:56.221 --> 00:31:59.222
If you're in the neighborhood again,
drop in.


504
00:31:59.302 --> 00:32:01.383
What's come over you?

505
00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:04.343
Should you want any peanuts
to snack on on the way home,


506
00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:07.544
I think I have a whole dish
of them in the other room.


507
00:32:07.624 --> 00:32:09.984
You hate women, don't you?

508
00:32:10.025 --> 00:32:13.505
Not at all. Actually,
they're a splendid gender.


509
00:32:13.545 --> 00:32:16.105
Really. A very pleasant variation.

510
00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:18.306
I should have known.
I should have known.


511
00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:22.227
A mousy little clerk like you,
just chasing your entire life
after criminals.


512
00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:25.147
- I should have known.
- No, Laura, don't be cross.


513
00:32:25.228 --> 00:32:28.588
Do drop in again in the springtime.
The oleander will be in bloom.


514
00:32:28.668 --> 00:32:31.509
I'm going! I'm getting out!

515
00:32:31.588 --> 00:32:35.069
I'm not used to getting kicked out of a
man's bed, but it could have been worse.


516
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:37.069
You're very sick, you know?

517
00:32:37.109 --> 00:32:39.910
Thanking you in advance
for understanding, Laura.


518
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.791
God bless you.
You have a splendidly shaped buttocks.


519
00:32:42.871 --> 00:32:46.311
- Mamma mia.
- God bless you, Laura.


520
00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:26.280
I can't believe it.
It's identical.


521
00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:29.520
You think somebody from the
Kensington household came over
and pulled this one too?


522
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.080
We did the security here.
We made the place fool proof.


523
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.041
Somebody's a step ahead of ya.

524
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:37.721
I want to speak to the Dillworths.
I want to question them.


525
00:33:37.841 --> 00:33:40.682
The Coopersmith detectives
have been grilling them all morning.


526
00:33:40.802 --> 00:33:43.043
Geez. You mean...
I can't believe it.


527
00:33:43.123 --> 00:33:46.123
She convinced Magruder
to put the Coopersmiths on.


528
00:33:46.204 --> 00:33:49.284
We need all the help
we can get on this case.


529
00:33:52.404 --> 00:33:54.685
What's happenin', fellas?
You want to talk to me?


530
00:33:54.765 --> 00:33:57.365
Hey, C.W.
We're in on this one now.


531
00:33:57.406 --> 00:34:00.486
Yeah? Well, this is my case,
just so you're clear on that.


532
00:34:00.566 --> 00:34:02.726
Will you listen to him?
Like we horned in.


533
00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:05.487
- Hey, they called us.
- That was their first mistake.


534
00:34:05.567 --> 00:34:07.448
Maybe they think you're slippin'.

535
00:34:07.527 --> 00:34:10.528
- You know my brother Joe?
- The one that died at birth?


536
00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.649
I hear you're havin'
a little trouble.


537
00:34:12.769 --> 00:34:15.289
- So you guys get any clues?
- A few.


538
00:34:15.369 --> 00:34:18.170
Yeah? What?
Wanna share them with me?


539
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.650
I'll let you know if they're real clues
or if you found your own laundry list.


540
00:34:21.731 --> 00:34:25.971
We'd like to make this collar. It'd mean
a long-term deal with North Coast.


541
00:34:26.051 --> 00:34:28.331
I hear they're makin'
some changes up there.


542
00:34:28.412 --> 00:34:30.772
Fellas, I'm gonna
make this bust,


543
00:34:30.852 --> 00:34:34.573
then you guys are gonna be back at your
old jobs tracking down lost poodles.


544
00:34:34.652 --> 00:34:39.213
We had to laugh when we heard
you thought the Kensington heist
was an inside job.


545
00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:42.934
I can see already we're gonna
be trippin' all over each other.


546
00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:46.175
- One of us is gonna fall down.
- We don't plan on fallin'.


547
00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:49.656
You're in over your heads...
all four of'em.


548
00:34:49.735 --> 00:34:51.616
This is a very smart burglar.

549
00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:55.096
You guys have trouble figuring out
who did it when you get a confession.


550
00:34:55.177 --> 00:34:56.977
I'll tell you what we figure.

551
00:34:57.057 --> 00:35:02.018
We're looking for a tall man,
heavyset, athletic, about 30 years old.


552
00:35:02.098 --> 00:35:04.058
Belly button in or out?

553
00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:06.539
Now, if he's short
at that weight, he's fat...


554
00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:08.459
too fat to squeeze
through the kitchen window.


555
00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:10.420
Wanna show him the big clue?

556
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.420
What's the big clue? The guy
leave behind his birth certificate?


557
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.341
Show him.

558
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.141
No one in this house
was ever to Rocky's Bar.


559
00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:22.062
Hey... I've been to Rocky's Bar.

560
00:35:22.182 --> 00:35:25.822
You got a matchbook. Big deal.
Six million people eat at Rocky's Bar.


561
00:35:25.903 --> 00:35:27.783
We're gonna nail this guy.

562
00:35:27.823 --> 00:35:31.104
The important thing is that you
don't think of us as competition.


563
00:35:31.183 --> 00:35:33.465
Don't worry. I don't.

564
00:35:37.945 --> 00:35:40.905
What are you so upset about?
We'll get the guy.


565
00:35:40.986 --> 00:35:44.546
Can you believe she talked Magruder
into hiring these two jerks?


566
00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:46.987
You've been moping around all day.

567
00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:49.508
It's not like you.
What's goin' on?


568
00:35:49.587 --> 00:35:53.388
- Al, I got a confession to make.
- What?


569
00:35:53.509 --> 00:35:58.069
I woke up this morning. I found
this on the floor in my apartment.


570
00:35:58.149 --> 00:36:02.550
- Yeah, so?
- I have no memory of being
with anybody last night.


571
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.230
Come on. How many times has that
happened to everybody?


572
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:07.711
You pick up a broad. You knock off
a bottle of booze. You're in the sack.


573
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.472
- So you didn't remember.
- There was also an empty bottle
of vodka on the floor.


574
00:36:11.511 --> 00:36:14.952
- I don't drink vodka.
- All the more reason you blacked out.


575
00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:17.113
Vodka does funny things to a person.
Believe me.


576
00:36:17.193 --> 00:36:20.234
I've gotten up with some pretty
strange- looking heads under my arm.


577
00:36:20.313 --> 00:36:24.635
I can't figure it out. There's
something wrong. I came back here.


578
00:36:24.754 --> 00:36:27.595
I wanted to check
something in my office.


579
00:36:27.715 --> 00:36:29.675
That I remember clearly.

580
00:36:29.795 --> 00:36:33.035
This was about 9:00.

581
00:36:33.076 --> 00:36:37.316
Hey, wait a minute. I ran into...
Wait a minute.


582
00:36:37.397 --> 00:36:40.237
- What are you thinkin'?
- Of course.


583
00:36:40.317 --> 00:36:43.438
No wonder I thought
it was an inside job.


584
00:36:43.518 --> 00:36:47.279
But not inside with the Dillworths
or the Kensingtons.


585
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:50.479
- It's inside our company.
- What?


586
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.560
It's so obvious.
Why didn't I see it right away?


587
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.840
Are you kiddin'? Who?
Mize, Bond and me.


588
00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.201
We're the only ones who have
access to your security setups.


589
00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.321
Yeah, and what if somebody
else was given access?


590
00:37:01.402 --> 00:37:04.922
What if someone
we don't know as well...


591
00:37:05.002 --> 00:37:07.963
because she hasn't worked here
as long as we've been here?


592
00:37:08.042 --> 00:37:10.683
- Fitzgerald?
- Why not?


593
00:37:10.763 --> 00:37:15.685
Why not? My God.
We've had female jewel thieves before.


594
00:37:15.764 --> 00:37:18.925
She's always saying she can
do anything a man can do.


595
00:37:19.005 --> 00:37:20.845
I don't think she meant stealing.

596
00:37:20.925 --> 00:37:23.486
What do we know about her?
Nothing.


597
00:37:23.525 --> 00:37:26.606
You know, she has expensive tastes.
She wears good jewelry.


598
00:37:26.726 --> 00:37:30.648
- I gotta get into her office.
- Don't.


599
00:37:30.727 --> 00:37:34.048
- I must
- If you get caught, she'll kill you.


600
00:37:34.128 --> 00:37:36.888
She'll take a gun and shoot you.
She goes duck hunting.


601
00:37:36.968 --> 00:37:40.449
But it makes all the sense in the world.
She's here late every night.


602
00:37:40.489 --> 00:37:42.690
She has the files...
We've given her the files.


603
00:37:42.729 --> 00:37:46.210
She knows all the security information.
I gotta go through her place.


604
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:50.531
Don't rifle her desk.
You're gonna get caught.


605
00:37:55.932 --> 00:37:57.933
- Uh...
- What Are you doing?


606
00:37:58.013 --> 00:38:00.053
- Me? No, I was...
- You're going through my desk.


607
00:38:00.173 --> 00:38:03.374
I beg your complete pardon.

608
00:38:03.453 --> 00:38:05.814
You're all red.
You were snooping through my papers.


609
00:38:05.894 --> 00:38:10.575
You know, only a suspicious, paranoid
mind would say something like that.


610
00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:13.455
I doubt very much whether
Amish people...


611
00:38:13.536 --> 00:38:15.375
or Quakers would come
to that conclusion.


612
00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:17.776
You wormy little ferret.

613
00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:19.776
Now you're mixing metaphors,
so you're upset.


614
00:38:19.857 --> 00:38:22.657
- I know why you're
snooping through my office.
- I wasn't snooping.


615
00:38:22.738 --> 00:38:24.818
You're looking for the report
by the Coopersmith Agency.


616
00:38:24.898 --> 00:38:27.699
- You hired them to give me a hard time.
- What?


617
00:38:27.778 --> 00:38:30.659
That's right. Now it's too many cooks,
and we're getting all over each other.


618
00:38:30.779 --> 00:38:34.579
These guys have made more progress in
a few hours than you have in two days.


619
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.580
Were you crying? 
Your mascara...

620
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.421
Don't try to tap-dance your way
out of getting caught searching my desk.


621
00:38:40.501 --> 00:38:43.261
I wasn't searching. I was rummag...
Can a colleague not rummage?


622
00:38:43.342 --> 00:38:47.262
Get out. If I ever catch you
going through my stuff again...


623
00:38:47.342 --> 00:38:50.423
- What are you afraid I'll find?
- You couldn't find your nose
if I turned the lights out.


624
00:38:50.502 --> 00:38:55.183
Watch out, 'cause I'm on to you. I know
what you are. I know what you're about.


625
00:38:55.264 --> 00:38:57.824
This is silly.
We should both calm down.


626
00:38:57.904 --> 00:39:01.265
I just had lunch, and you're
liable to overtax your heart
and have a massive stroke,


627
00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:04.905
killing you instantly or
paralyzing half your body.


628
00:39:04.986 --> 00:39:06.866
Have a nice day.

629
00:39:06.906 --> 00:39:09.627
- I gotta get into her apartment.
- You're askin' for trouble.


630
00:39:09.706 --> 00:39:12.587
- She hit the ceiling
when she caught me before.
- Can you blame her?


631
00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:16.027
'Cause she's guilty.
Look behind her eyes. She's a bad broad.


632
00:39:16.108 --> 00:39:19.709
- She's got pretty eyes.
- I said look behind, behind the eyes.


633
00:39:19.789 --> 00:39:23.390
There's something wrong...
The minute I met this broad,
I sensed there was trouble.


634
00:39:23.469 --> 00:39:25.430
She says the same thing about you.

635
00:39:25.509 --> 00:39:27.671
If you two were prize fighters,
we could get a million-dollar gate.


636
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.551
- I gotta get into her place.
- Look, let me tell you something.


637
00:39:30.631 --> 00:39:32.991
Being an investigator
doesn't put you above the law.


638
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:35.032
She catches you,
she's gonna have you locked up.


639
00:39:35.152 --> 00:39:37.112
Has that ever stopped me before?

640
00:39:37.232 --> 00:39:39.512
- She's going out tonight.
- How do you know?


641
00:39:39.553 --> 00:39:41.513
'Cause I went through her desk.
I know her appointments.


642
00:39:41.633 --> 00:39:44.553
She's meeting her sister tonight
for dinner at a restaurant.


643
00:39:44.634 --> 00:39:46.994
I thought she said her sister
was an invalid in Detroit.


644
00:39:47.074 --> 00:39:49.755
That's what I'm tellin' ya.
Nothing she says ever checks out.


645
00:39:49.835 --> 00:39:53.035
Yeah, well, you know, you can't break
into her apartment. It's unethical.


646
00:39:53.115 --> 00:39:55.196
I'm not gonna break in.
I got the key.


647
00:39:55.236 --> 00:39:58.076
- How did you manage that?
- I stole it from her purse.


648
00:39:58.116 --> 00:40:00.916
She's gonna know something's up
when it's missing, right?


649
00:40:00.997 --> 00:40:04.037
She'll never know. I made a duplicate.
I put the original back.


650
00:40:04.117 --> 00:40:06.517
My God. You know, you've got
a touch of larceny in you.


651
00:40:06.598 --> 00:40:08.638
You would have made
one heck of a thief.


652
00:40:08.758 --> 00:40:10.599
It takes one to catch one.
Don't forget that.


653
00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:12.559
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, see ya around.


654
00:40:58.248 --> 00:41:01.849
- Can I take your coat, honey?
- I'll get it.


655
00:41:01.928 --> 00:41:05.129
Okay, what did you want
to tell me?


656
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.330
No drink?

657
00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:11.170
We've had enough drinks.
How much alcohol do you need
to be completely honest?


658
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.691
- You're not making this very easy.
- Why should I make it easy?


659
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:16.931
Because we care about each other.

660
00:41:17.011 --> 00:41:19.852
Before it was you loved me.
Now it's that you care for me?


661
00:41:19.972 --> 00:41:23.373
- Just sit down.
- I'm not gonna faint.
- I've been dumped before.


662
00:41:23.453 --> 00:41:25.894
I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.


663
00:41:25.933 --> 00:41:28.214
You rushed me out of
that restaurant to talk...


664
00:41:28.294 --> 00:41:30.855
because you were afraid I was
going to make a scene or pass out.


665
00:41:30.894 --> 00:41:32.814
You are a highly volatile woman.

666
00:41:32.895 --> 00:41:35.455
Am I? Most men complain
I'm cool as ice.


667
00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:38.575
- You know I care about you.
- You said that. Get to the point.


668
00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:42.256
- It's not that I don't want
- to leave Caroline...
- But in the end, you're not.


669
00:41:42.337 --> 00:41:45.217
I've tried to work up
the courage a hundred times.


670
00:41:45.297 --> 00:41:50.018
All those promises? Those stories
about how miserable you were at home?


671
00:41:50.098 --> 00:41:53.219
- You're making this into a nightmare.
- Isn't it? It is for me.


672
00:41:53.299 --> 00:41:57.099
- Try to understand.
- We can still be friends.
- Oh!


673
00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.340
- We can even continue to sleep together.
- Are you nuts?


674
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.381
I only got involved in this
because you told me your
marriage was on its last legs.


675
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:06.741
When you say it like that,
it sounds like I've deceived you.


676
00:42:06.782 --> 00:42:09.862
- Haven't you?
- I didn't mean to.


677
00:42:09.942 --> 00:42:12.143
I respect you too much.

678
00:42:12.182 --> 00:42:16.463
Oh, my God. How did we go from love
to you care for me to you respect me?


679
00:42:16.544 --> 00:42:18.544
Next thing you'll be
buying me a prayer shawl.


680
00:42:18.623 --> 00:42:21.464
- Betty Ann...
- Leave me alone, okay? Please.


681
00:42:21.504 --> 00:42:23.385
- Betty...
- Just go... I'll be fine. Leave me alone.


682
00:42:23.424 --> 00:42:25.625
- Honey, listen...
- Leave me alone!


683
00:42:26.905 --> 00:42:29.266
I hope you decide
to stay on at North Coast.


684
00:42:29.345 --> 00:42:32.146
You're really helping
to turn our company around.


685
00:42:32.187 --> 00:42:34.827
I guess we won't be having
that honeymoon in Positano, huh?


686
00:42:34.907 --> 00:42:36.747
I feel like such a jerk!

687
00:42:36.827 --> 00:42:40.027
You shouldn't. It's my fault. I got
into this against my better judgment.


688
00:42:40.068 --> 00:42:42.189
- Honey...
- Just go.


689
00:43:26.717 --> 00:43:30.678
Good- bye, Chris.
Good- bye, New York.


690
00:43:35.438 --> 00:43:38.759
Miss Fitzgerald!
God! What are you doing?


691
00:43:38.879 --> 00:43:42.280
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean, what am I doing here?


692
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.721
- What are you doing here?
- I happened to be passing through.


693
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.001
- You what?
- I'm... What do you... I was... I'm...


694
00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:50.561
- I'm hiding behind your screen.
- Behind what?


695
00:43:50.642 --> 00:43:53.722
You have this nice Japanese screen.
I was hiding behind it.


696
00:43:53.803 --> 00:43:56.523
How did you get in?
How long have you been here?


697
00:43:56.603 --> 00:43:59.083
I... What time... I've been here
quite a while, actually.


698
00:43:59.164 --> 00:44:01.123
- You broke into my apartment?
- I didn't break in.


699
00:44:01.204 --> 00:44:03.604
- How did you get in?
- You really want to know?


700
00:44:03.685 --> 00:44:06.085
- How did you get in here?
- I made a duplicate of your key.


701
00:44:06.165 --> 00:44:09.046
- You what?
- Which you can have for no extra charge.


702
00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:11.966
It's good to have two keys, 'cause
an emergency happens once in a while.


703
00:44:12.046 --> 00:44:14.247
- Why did you do this to me?
- What? Why?


704
00:44:14.286 --> 00:44:17.927
Because I'm convinced
somebody up at North Coast...


705
00:44:17.967 --> 00:44:20.207
is responsible for the jewel robbery.

706
00:44:20.288 --> 00:44:23.128
- Who, me?
- Well, you're a prime suspect, yes.


707
00:44:23.208 --> 00:44:27.049
- Based on what?
- Based on the fact that I know
- everybody else better than you.


708
00:44:27.129 --> 00:44:30.170
- You have access to all the data.
- So? So do you.


709
00:44:30.249 --> 00:44:33.170
But you were so nervous the other night
when I caught you up there.


710
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.410
I came up, and you were
acting so strange.


711
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:38.130
You have a Rocky's matchbook.
I saw you put it in your...


712
00:44:38.211 --> 00:44:40.651
Remember we had a drink at Rocky's Bar?
It didn't go too well.


713
00:44:40.732 --> 00:44:44.092
So you broke into my apartment illegally
and spied on me?


714
00:44:44.212 --> 00:44:47.533
I wasn't spying. What's wrong with you?
I was rummaging.


715
00:44:47.653 --> 00:44:50.373
- I'm a big rummager.
- You what?


716
00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:55.174
I was rummaging in the afternoon.
I saw "dinner with my sister."


717
00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:59.455
All those sisters- all those dinners-
Those were with Magruder, right?


718
00:44:59.535 --> 00:45:01.375
Oh, God! I'm mortified!

719
00:45:01.455 --> 00:45:05.216
Stop it. If it wasn't for me being here,
they'd be scraping you up with a spoon.


720
00:45:05.296 --> 00:45:07.137
That's none of your business,
you slimy little weasel.


721
00:45:07.216 --> 00:45:09.257
And over a jerk like Magruder.

722
00:45:09.337 --> 00:45:12.898
He's not a jerk. He's wonderful.
He's twice the man you are, you roach.


723
00:45:12.977 --> 00:45:16.818
Don't you see? He gives you these
stories so he can get into your pants.


724
00:45:16.939 --> 00:45:19.779
- He's not gonna leave his wife.
- You witnessed my humiliation.


725
00:45:19.859 --> 00:45:23.780
The only humiliating thing
is how this guy takes advantage
of a smart woman like you.


726
00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.541
You're not fit to discuss
Chris Magruder.


727
00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.541
Look at this. She still loves the guy.
I can't believe it.


728
00:45:29.621 --> 00:45:32.702
Get out before I call the police
and have you arrested
for breaking and entering.


729
00:45:32.782 --> 00:45:36.062
I'm not letting you alone here tonight.
Are you crazy? Look at you.


730
00:45:36.143 --> 00:45:38.943
I'd ask if you had any friends,
but I know the answer.


731
00:45:39.023 --> 00:45:43.424
Give me this. Jesus. What...

732
00:45:43.504 --> 00:45:46.825
What...
Great.


733
00:45:48.065 --> 00:45:50.465
Are you okay?

734
00:45:50.545 --> 00:45:52.706
- Hello?
- Oh.


735
00:45:52.746 --> 00:45:54.626
Jesus.

736
00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:21.511
What the hell are you doing here?

737
00:46:21.552 --> 00:46:23.592
I'm making coffee.

738
00:46:23.712 --> 00:46:25.832
Oh, God!
It's all coming back to me now.


739
00:46:25.912 --> 00:46:28.472
You came here last night because
you thought I stole some jewels!


740
00:46:28.553 --> 00:46:30.873
This happens to be
a very confusing case.


741
00:46:30.953 --> 00:46:33.314
I'll say you're confused.
Why didn't you go home to sleep?


742
00:46:33.354 --> 00:46:35.994
- Are you kidding?
- And let you do something crazy?
- Like what?


743
00:46:36.074 --> 00:46:37.995
Like take a swan dive out the window.

744
00:46:38.074 --> 00:46:40.035
How do you know I wouldn't take
a swan dive with you here?


745
00:46:40.075 --> 00:46:43.756
- Because I watched over you.
- You stayed up all night watching me?


746
00:46:43.835 --> 00:46:46.076
That's exactly right. Yes.

747
00:46:46.156 --> 00:46:48.756
And you snore like a grizzly bear
with a sinus condition.


748
00:46:48.876 --> 00:46:50.717
I had a bad moment last night.
I'm fine now.


749
00:46:50.797 --> 00:46:54.198
- You talk in your sleep.
- You probably took notes,
- you suspicious little inchworm.


750
00:46:54.318 --> 00:46:56.998
- Who's Rita?
- Rita's the woman
- my ex-husband ran away with.


751
00:46:57.078 --> 00:47:00.479
- Anything else?
- You certainly know how to pick men.


752
00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:02.560
Check your sex.
There's not a lot to pick from.


753
00:47:02.639 --> 00:47:05.360
And you mentioned my name too.
I thought you were awake.


754
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.921
- You said that I should rot in hell.
- I was probably awake.


755
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.841
I figured you were feeling better.

756
00:47:09.921 --> 00:47:14.082
Now, if you'll go, I gotta
be at work in 30 minutes, and
don't gossip about what you saw.


757
00:47:14.161 --> 00:47:18.883
Nobody's gonna gossip.
I couldn't care less about your
life. It means nothing to me.


758
00:47:18.962 --> 00:47:22.283
I couldn't stand you when I met you,
and I can't stand you now.


759
00:47:22.323 --> 00:47:25.204
I find you obnoxious and pompous...
Do me a favor.


760
00:47:25.324 --> 00:47:28.885
When you see me in the office... do me
a favor... walk the other way, okay?


761
00:47:28.925 --> 00:47:32.005
And if Magruder tells you
he's gonna leave his wife,


762
00:47:32.086 --> 00:47:35.366
if I were you,
I would keep my legs crossed.


763
00:47:35.446 --> 00:47:37.686
Don't choke on your breakfast
and die of as phyxiation.


764
00:47:37.766 --> 00:47:42.127
You'll wind up unable to
dislodge a large piece of toast,
no matter how hard you cough.


765
00:47:47.968 --> 00:47:49.848
Mr. Magruder, you sent for...

766
00:47:49.889 --> 00:47:54.889
Oh. If you'll all open
your hymn books to page 90...


767
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.330
Sit down, C.W.
We have a situation.


768
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:01.091
Your brother looks good.
The embalmer did nice work.


769
00:48:01.171 --> 00:48:03.492
I'll let the Coopersmiths
bring you up to date.


770
00:48:03.571 --> 00:48:07.893
After careful search, using some of
the most up-to-minute techniques,


771
00:48:07.932 --> 00:48:09.893
we found some interesting clues.

772
00:48:09.972 --> 00:48:12.253
Yeah? Leading to who,
Eleanor Roosevelt?


773
00:48:12.333 --> 00:48:15.333
We got a shoe print off the
parapet at the Kensington place.


774
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:16.734
So?

775
00:48:16.813 --> 00:48:19.734
An eight-and-a-half
"C" Florsheim cordovan.


776
00:48:19.774 --> 00:48:22.095
Only worn by 20 million Americans.

777
00:48:22.174 --> 00:48:25.256
I mean, I wear an eight-and-a-half"C"
cordovan Florsheim shoe.


778
00:48:25.375 --> 00:48:28.816
For the money, you cannot
get a better shoe.


779
00:48:28.896 --> 00:48:31.137
We also found a couple of hairs.

780
00:48:31.216 --> 00:48:35.418
One on the rug at the Kensington
place, the other one actually
inside the Dillworth safe.


781
00:48:35.458 --> 00:48:37.338
They match.

782
00:48:37.378 --> 00:48:39.778
Forgive me if I'm not knocked out.

783
00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:43.499
Oh, we don't mean just to each other.
They match yours.


784
00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:46.219
Just like the eight-and-a-half
"C"cordovans.


785
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.780
Hey, fellas. I know you guys
are angling for my job...


786
00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:52.261
We also got a fingerprint
off the matchbook.


787
00:48:52.341 --> 00:48:54.782
You got a fingerprint
off a matchbook?


788
00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:57.421
The Coopersmith lab uses
highly sensitive apparatus.


789
00:48:57.542 --> 00:49:01.063
- You're not gonna tell me it's mine?
- It is, C.W.


790
00:49:01.142 --> 00:49:04.423
Well, so what?
So I leave a footprint on the parapet,


791
00:49:04.463 --> 00:49:07.023
or I inadvertently drop a matchbook.

792
00:49:07.104 --> 00:49:09.864
The matchbook was found before
you got over to the place.


793
00:49:09.904 --> 00:49:13.064
You guys don't doubt my honesty,
do you?


794
00:49:13.105 --> 00:49:15.506
Let me tell you, I was
a Boy Scout for three years.


795
00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:18.386
I got a number of merit badges
home, and my clergyman,


796
00:49:18.466 --> 00:49:22.227
who happens right now to be wanted
for pederasty, will vouch for me.


797
00:49:22.307 --> 00:49:25.147
Nobody's making any accusations.

798
00:49:25.227 --> 00:49:27.708
You do have some outstanding debt
from expensive sports betting...


799
00:49:27.788 --> 00:49:29.628
baseball, the ponies.

800
00:49:29.748 --> 00:49:31.628
Are you guys investigating me?

801
00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:36.549
C.W., I assure you, this is only
an inquiry in-house at this time.


802
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:40.071
We don't want the police
to know about it, and we're
not looking for bad publicity.


803
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.911
Miss Fitzgerald, what do you think?
Say something.


804
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:46.311
You're a bright woman.
You think I did it?


805
00:49:46.392 --> 00:49:50.352
Please, C.W. let's not have
our daily bloodbath between
you and Miss Fitzgerald.


806
00:49:50.392 --> 00:49:53.913
- She's not an investigator.
- But she's a very bright woman.
- She's got a lot of ideas.


807
00:49:53.993 --> 00:49:56.353
She was the one who brought these
two mouth breathers in on this case.


808
00:49:56.433 --> 00:49:59.114
It's nothin' personal.
We're just building a case.


809
00:49:59.154 --> 00:50:02.435
We all want to catch a jewel thief.
I'm on your side.


810
00:50:02.515 --> 00:50:05.315
Fellas, I think
we gotta get team jackets.


811
00:50:07.356 --> 00:50:10.796
I want a resume of every employee who
works here messengered to my apartment.


812
00:50:10.836 --> 00:50:15.037
Don't worry, C.W.
We'll get to the bottom of this.


813
00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:17.717
Oh, Miss Fitzgerald,
I wanted to meet with you later.


814
00:50:17.798 --> 00:50:20.878
- About what, Mr. Magruder?
- Our Paris account.


815
00:50:20.918 --> 00:50:22.839
As I recall,
that account is closed.


816
00:50:22.918 --> 00:50:25.159
I have to see you later.
Just to talk.


817
00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:28.799
I behaved like such a fool.
Later, f-for a drink. Just for a drink.


818
00:50:55.004 --> 00:50:57.485
Oh. Well.

819
00:50:57.566 --> 00:50:59.805
Can I come in?

820
00:50:59.886 --> 00:51:02.206
Yeah, sure. I
-I'm shocked.

821
00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:04.127
I... The place is a little messy.

822
00:51:04.167 --> 00:51:07.127
if I knew you were coming, I would have
had the maid rearrange the dirt.


823
00:51:07.247 --> 00:51:09.127
Are you alone?

824
00:51:09.248 --> 00:51:11.128
Alone? Yeah. Of course.

825
00:51:11.208 --> 00:51:14.529
I would have called, but I decided
it was safer to talk to you in person.


826
00:51:14.608 --> 00:51:17.409
- What do you mean, "safer"?
- I can't stay long.


827
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:19.329
Why? You gonna meet
Magruder in Paris?


828
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.530
That's none of your business.

829
00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:25.371
Thanks for coming to my defense today in
the office. It was really nice of you.


830
00:51:25.411 --> 00:51:27.371
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.


831
00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:31.252
The Coopersmith brothers had Laura
Kensington in for questioning today.


832
00:51:31.332 --> 00:51:33.692
She told them she was with you
the night before last...


833
00:51:33.773 --> 00:51:37.453
and that you got a phone call
in the middle of the night
and began acting strangely...


834
00:51:37.533 --> 00:51:40.214
and got rid of her because you
had to go someplace at midnight?


835
00:51:40.293 --> 00:51:42.574
Well, let me tell you, she's lying.

836
00:51:42.654 --> 00:51:45.415
- Why would she lie?
- Wh... Use your head.


837
00:51:45.455 --> 00:51:49.255
Would I kick Laura Kensington
out of my bed at midnight?


838
00:51:49.335 --> 00:51:51.176
Even if the president needed me.

839
00:51:51.255 --> 00:51:54.617
- Why Are you lying to me?
- Why did you come here
- with this crazy story?


840
00:51:54.696 --> 00:51:57.057
Because i should have spoken up
at that meeting today.


841
00:51:57.097 --> 00:51:59.418
Because while I think you're
a mealy-mouthed little...


842
00:51:59.497 --> 00:52:02.458
- Reptile.
- reptile... Thank you...
I don't think you're a jewel thief.


843
00:52:02.538 --> 00:52:05.258
- What makes you so positive?
- It's too daring for you.


844
00:52:05.378 --> 00:52:08.459
You're not romantic enough.
It requires flair and imagination.


845
00:52:08.539 --> 00:52:10.700
My instinct's telling me
you're not the one.


846
00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.220
- I didn't think you had instincts.
- I have them.


847
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.141
I don't usually trust them, especially
when it comes to sizing up men,


848
00:52:16.181 --> 00:52:18.061
but this time I can feel it.

849
00:52:18.141 --> 00:52:21.102
You're good at weaselly type things,
like snooping and spying.


850
00:52:21.181 --> 00:52:23.222
You're not man enough
to be a cat burglar.


851
00:52:23.302 --> 00:52:26.863
- You sound like you're attracted
- to men who break the law.
- We're not here to discuss me.


852
00:52:26.903 --> 00:52:30.544
We're here to talk about what Laura
Kensington told the Coopersmiths.


853
00:52:30.584 --> 00:52:32.584
Laura Kensington wasn't here.

854
00:52:32.664 --> 00:52:35.625
She... You're making...
Laura Kensington was not here.


855
00:52:35.665 --> 00:52:38.545
She said she left her stocking here.

856
00:52:38.625 --> 00:52:40.945
Hey, that could be anybody's.
I don't know...


857
00:52:40.986 --> 00:52:42.946
A lot of women pass
through this apartment.


858
00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:45.706
I'm not saying they're all winners,
but there's a lot of action here.


859
00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:48.107
I 'm sure you're not overly particular.

860
00:52:48.147 --> 00:52:50.667
Look. What do you want from me?

861
00:52:50.748 --> 00:52:55.269
I happen to enjoy the proximity
of a well-proportioned member
of the opposite sex.


862
00:52:55.348 --> 00:52:59.629
That's how God created us,
and why should I be the one
to quibble with His concept?


863
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.870
I came to tell you a case is building
against you. Be honest with me!


864
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:05.230
- I'm honest. I'm honest.
- Where did you get this stocking?


865
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.151
It's some broad's.

866
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:10.071
The women that are here, they lose
an earring, a stocking, I don't know.


867
00:53:10.151 --> 00:53:12.792
Laura Kensington says it's hers.
She also says she tipped the super.


868
00:53:12.871 --> 00:53:16.032
He let her in here,
and that story checks out.


869
00:53:16.113 --> 00:53:18.713
- Whoever that is, I'm not here.
- What? Wh...


870
00:53:20.753 --> 00:53:23.154
- Who is it?
- It's Herb and Joe C.oopersmith.


871
00:53:23.194 --> 00:53:25.114
I don't want to be seen here!

872
00:53:25.154 --> 00:53:27.195
Why? What's the problem?
What am I, a leper?


873
00:53:27.274 --> 00:53:29.715
You're under suspicion.
I would have a lot of explaining to do.


874
00:53:29.755 --> 00:53:32.036
You know, I think you're still hooked
on Magruder.


875
00:53:32.115 --> 00:53:34.516
That's why you don't...
Go down the end of the hall.


876
00:53:34.596 --> 00:53:36.476
There's a bedroom.
Shut the door. Go in the bedroom.


877
00:53:36.516 --> 00:53:39.357
Can I sit down in there,
or will I catch something?


878
00:53:39.397 --> 00:53:42.237
Germs can't live in your bloodstream.
It's too cold.


879
00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:50.720
Let's go, C.W. Open up.

880
00:53:50.759 --> 00:53:52.679
Coming!

881
00:54:01.241 --> 00:54:03.442
Hey, fellas.
You sure you got the right apartment?


882
00:54:03.522 --> 00:54:06.083
The traps with the cheese
are in the basement.


883
00:54:06.122 --> 00:54:08.322
- Can we come in?
- Now, wait a minute.


884
00:54:08.403 --> 00:54:11.844
I got a chorus girl in the back room,
and if I don't hurry up...


885
00:54:11.923 --> 00:54:14.244
Wouldn't be Laura Kensington,
would it?


886
00:54:14.364 --> 00:54:16.245
Laura Kensington?
I don't know.


887
00:54:16.324 --> 00:54:18.485
They all look the same upside down.
I can never tell.


888
00:54:18.565 --> 00:54:20.485
She says she was here
the other night,


889
00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:23.966
till you dumped her to go out on
mysterious middle-of-the-night business.


890
00:54:24.046 --> 00:54:27.286
Hey, would I dump Laura Kensington?
I eat Wheaties.


891
00:54:27.366 --> 00:54:32.367
Problem is, Eddie, the night guard from
the North Coast building, says you, uh,


892
00:54:32.447 --> 00:54:35.528
made some strange middle-of-the-night
visits to your office...


893
00:54:35.568 --> 00:54:37.688
both nights the robberies took place.

894
00:54:37.769 --> 00:54:39.889
Fellas, I'd love to chat
with you, but, you know,


895
00:54:39.969 --> 00:54:42.129
there's a nurse in
the other room there, and...


896
00:54:42.209 --> 00:54:44.129
I thought you said
she was a chorus girl.


897
00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.610
Who does a little nursing?
Give me a break.


898
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:49.450
Come on. We can discuss this
tomorrow, can't we?


899
00:54:49.491 --> 00:54:52.411
I don't know how you can still make love
with this on your mind.


900
00:54:52.491 --> 00:54:54.332
You know, you're facing
a long jail sentence.


901
00:54:54.411 --> 00:54:57.052
That's exactly why I gotta
get in all I can now.


902
00:54:57.132 --> 00:54:59.973
Yeah? Well, we're gonna turn this over
to the police tomorrow.


903
00:55:00.012 --> 00:55:03.414
You can see. There's a case developing
that's pretty incriminating.


904
00:55:03.493 --> 00:55:05.614
This is circumstantial evidence.
That's all you got.


905
00:55:05.654 --> 00:55:09.214
Many a man's gone to the gallows
on circumstantial evidence.


906
00:55:09.295 --> 00:55:11.135
Well, fellas, the gallows
are gonna have to wait,


907
00:55:11.215 --> 00:55:13.936
because I got a cocktail waitress
in the other room now, and I...


908
00:55:14.015 --> 00:55:16.576
- Cocktail waitress?
- Yeah, a nurse, you know,


909
00:55:16.656 --> 00:55:19.057
who... who's a little bit
of a chorus girl,


910
00:55:19.096 --> 00:55:20.977
and she works a lounge now and then.

911
00:55:21.097 --> 00:55:22.977
If you catch the jewel thief,
let me know.


912
00:55:23.058 --> 00:55:25.018
- I'll get you both new yo-yos.
- Yeah.


913
00:55:28.338 --> 00:55:30.179
They're...

914
00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:34.580
- What is this?
- I was...


915
00:55:34.619 --> 00:55:36.500
browsing through your bookshelf,

916
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:40.941
and I found this deck
of naked playing cards and these.


917
00:55:40.981 --> 00:55:42.861
This is... What do you...

918
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:44.741
This is... This is
the Kensington jewels.


919
00:55:44.822 --> 00:55:48.102
This is the... This is
the Dillworth jewels and the... the...


920
00:55:48.182 --> 00:55:50.063
This is...
What Are you...


921
00:55:51.663 --> 00:55:53.504
What Are you looking
at me like that for?


922
00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:57.625
Because you found them in amongst
my collection of female art studies?


923
00:55:57.664 --> 00:55:59.545
What is the implication here?

924
00:55:59.584 --> 00:56:01.465
I used to go
with the six of spades.

925
00:56:01.505 --> 00:56:04.105
Then the four of diamonds
caught us together and there was a...


926
00:56:04.186 --> 00:56:07.466
I was aware that you sneaked up
mysteriously to the office
in the middle of the night...


927
00:56:07.546 --> 00:56:09.387
and the lobby guard saw you.

928
00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.787
I know you have Laura Kensington's
stocking, and she swears...


929
00:56:11.867 --> 00:56:15.347
you kicked her out of bed to
take care of sudden business,
which your super corroborates.


930
00:56:15.428 --> 00:56:18.188
They have a footprint,
a match book with your fingerprint,


931
00:56:18.268 --> 00:56:21.589
and still I believed
that you didn't do it.


932
00:56:21.669 --> 00:56:25.950
But now the actual stolen property
turns up hidden in your bedroom.


933
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:28.470
So what Are you saying?
This makes you suspicious of me?


934
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:32.271
I was actually a bit touched that you
stayed up all night watching over me.


935
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:36.512
I began to think, " Maybe he's not the
scummy little vermin he seems to be. "


936
00:56:36.591 --> 00:56:39.672
I maybe a scummy vermin,
but I'm an honest scummy vermin.


937
00:56:39.713 --> 00:56:42.193
- I didn't take these jewels.
- How can you deny it?


938
00:56:42.273 --> 00:56:44.633
- You've been caught red-handed.
- Yes, I...


939
00:56:44.713 --> 00:56:48.034
What... I'm... I grant you,
there's a fingerprint of me,


940
00:56:48.074 --> 00:56:51.595
and they have a footprint,
and the jewels are in my bedroom.


941
00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:53.515
This I give you.

942
00:56:53.635 --> 00:56:57.156
- I'm starting to think
- I'm in tremendous trouble here.
- I'm calling the police.


943
00:56:57.236 --> 00:57:00.317
No. Will you forget about logic
and give me the benefit of the doubt?


944
00:57:00.356 --> 00:57:02.757
- Ha! That makes me an accessory.
- Not if I'm innocent.


945
00:57:02.877 --> 00:57:04.917
You don't have a kosher bone
in your body.


946
00:57:04.997 --> 00:57:08.478
That's exactly why you get your selves
into these problems.


947
00:57:08.518 --> 00:57:10.918
That's why Magruder's
waiting for you, right?


948
00:57:10.999 --> 00:57:13.959
You make all the wrong decisions
'cause you make 'em here, not here.


949
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.679
Decisions made here
are not as reliable as here,


950
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.200
because this is gray cells
and this is blood,


951
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.121
and blood circulates
through the body.


952
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:23.361
It gets around.
It knows what the score is.


953
00:57:23.401 --> 00:57:26.202
But up here, gray cells
just lay there and think.


954
00:57:26.281 --> 00:57:27.361
You see what I'm saying?

955
00:57:27.402 --> 00:57:30.282
You see what I'm saying?

956
00:57:30.402 --> 00:57:33.122
- Hello?
- Constantinople.


957
00:57:34.563 --> 00:57:36.644
You will take the jewels,
each and every one of them.


958
00:57:36.804 --> 00:57:38.603
Make sure you have them all.

959
00:57:38.684 --> 00:57:42.444
Wrap them tightly in brown paper
so it's impossible for anyone
to tell what they are.


960
00:57:42.484 --> 00:57:46.285
Go to Grand Central Station.
Rent a locker. Lock them in.


961
00:57:46.406 --> 00:57:49.766
Go home, taking the key with you,
and put the key in your mailbox.


962
00:57:49.886 --> 00:57:52.287
Make sure to leave the mailbox open.

963
00:57:52.366 --> 00:57:55.567
Then you will go into a deep,
refreshing slumber, and when you awake,


964
00:57:55.608 --> 00:57:57.608
you will remember nothing
of what has transpired.


965
00:57:57.687 --> 00:57:59.968
Is that clear?

966
00:58:05.169 --> 00:58:07.049
Miss Fitzgerald?

967
00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:10.250
Have... Have I ever told you...

968
00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:14.811
that you're one of the most
beautiful women I've ever met?


969
00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:18.411
- I'm turning you in.
- No, I mean it.


970
00:58:18.492 --> 00:58:21.972
That's what made me first fall in love
with you is those beautiful eyes.


971
00:58:22.092 --> 00:58:25.013
I can't believe it. You're actually
trying to sweet-talk me?


972
00:58:25.093 --> 00:58:27.453
I resisted because, well, down deep...

973
00:58:27.534 --> 00:58:29.373
I thought that you might hurt me,

974
00:58:29.454 --> 00:58:31.935
and I didn't want to put myself
in that position again.


975
00:58:32.014 --> 00:58:34.054
C.W., let me set you straight
once and for all.


976
00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:37.055
I wouldn't be interested in you
if you were the last man on Earth.


977
00:58:37.136 --> 00:58:39.296
Not only that, I find it insulting
that you could think...


978
00:58:39.376 --> 00:58:41.297
I would fall for such
a heavy-handed ploy.


979
00:58:41.336 --> 00:58:43.376
What a low opinion
of me you must have.


980
00:58:43.417 --> 00:58:45.217
Thank you for dropping by.

981
00:58:45.297 --> 00:58:48.857
I'm a little busy right now,
but tomorrow night,
maybe we could have dinner.


982
00:58:48.938 --> 00:58:50.778
I know a candlelight restaurant.

983
00:58:50.858 --> 00:58:54.058
I could look into your eyes
and tell you how crazy about you I am.


984
00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:57.539
if I didn't know what a squirming
little trapped rat you were,


985
00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.460
I'd think you had a brain tumor.

986
00:59:16.544 --> 00:59:19.144
- You're late.
- God, I'm still trembling.


987
00:59:19.224 --> 00:59:21.144
Over last night?
I couldn't sleep a wink.


988
00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.424
It's not that, Chris. It's Briggs.

989
00:59:24.705 --> 00:59:27.945
He's guilty, isn't he?
It's a sad story.


990
00:59:28.025 --> 00:59:30.145
Please don't make me
go into all the details,


991
00:59:30.186 --> 00:59:33.906
but I wonder if he's having some kind
of mental breakdown.


992
00:59:33.986 --> 00:59:36.347
He may be realizing
the consequences of his deeds.


993
00:59:36.427 --> 00:59:39.107
- The Coopersmiths are closing in on him.
- Could he have...


994
00:59:39.148 --> 00:59:41.028
a split personality?

995
00:59:41.068 --> 00:59:44.509
A lot of criminals have been
known to play crafty games
when it suited their purposes.


996
00:59:44.548 --> 00:59:47.389
I need a drink.

997
00:59:47.429 --> 00:59:50.950
if I tell you something, do you promise
not to go off half-cocked?


998
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:53.910
Okay, but hurry.
I've got some big news.


999
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:55.871
- I found the jewels.
- What?


1000
01:00:07.593 --> 01:00:09.634
And keep me apprised, will you?
Thank you.


1001
01:00:12.754 --> 01:00:14.955
The police are on the way, thank God.

1002
01:00:15.034 --> 01:00:16.875
It's an open-and-shut case.

1003
01:00:16.955 --> 01:00:19.756
Much as I cringe at the publicity,
I'm elated at the recovery.


1004
01:00:19.796 --> 01:00:23.077
It's clear there's
so much more to this, Chris.


1005
01:00:23.116 --> 01:00:26.917
Oh, I've seen men driven to extremes
before being around big money.


1006
01:00:26.997 --> 01:00:28.958
These guys earn their living exposing...

1007
01:00:29.037 --> 01:00:32.318
all kinds of exotic schemes
to defraud and rob people.


1008
01:00:32.398 --> 01:00:35.478
Sometimes they start thinking,
" Hey, I'm on the inside.
I know why these schemes fail.


1009
01:00:35.559 --> 01:00:37.399
I won't make the same mistakes. "

1010
01:00:37.479 --> 01:00:40.880
You're saying he's cracked
from so many years of hard work?


1011
01:00:40.959 --> 01:00:45.161
He's a driven man.
Had a terrible marital experience.


1012
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.241
Turned him off women, except for
the little no-threat secretaries...


1013
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:50.642
and barflies he picks up.

1014
01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:52.922
Crushed when he caught
his wife cheating.


1015
01:00:53.002 --> 01:00:54.842
He's feeling older
and looks around and says,


1016
01:00:54.922 --> 01:00:57.802
" Hey, maybe it's time
I get mine and get out. "


1017
01:00:57.883 --> 01:01:00.163
Guy named Peterson
a couple of years ago tried the same.


1018
01:01:00.244 --> 01:01:03.084
Of course, he's a houseguest
at Sing Sing these days.


1019
01:01:03.124 --> 01:01:06.204
Well, I'm sure you know him
better than I do.


1020
01:01:06.285 --> 01:01:08.245
It'll resolve itself.

1021
01:01:08.325 --> 01:01:11.886
Um, Betty Ann, 
I spoke with Caroline.

1022
01:01:13.406 --> 01:01:16.366
- You did?
- I told her I wanted my freedom.


1023
01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:20.607
- Really?
- Isn't that fabulous?


1024
01:01:20.688 --> 01:01:22.528
It's surprising.

1025
01:01:22.608 --> 01:01:24.448
I thought you'd be
knocked off your feet.


1026
01:01:24.528 --> 01:01:27.448
Well, I mean, it was last night.

1027
01:01:27.529 --> 01:01:29.890
- It's sort of like a roller coaster.
- Forget about last night.


1028
01:01:29.969 --> 01:01:32.330
I knew I'd made a mistake
the minute I left your apartment.


1029
01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.410
What did she say?

1030
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.171
I think she sensed
we'd been drifting apart.


1031
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:39.091
she was very poised.

1032
01:01:39.131 --> 01:01:41.652
Said if I was sure
that's what I wanted, uh...


1033
01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.212
- Thank you.
- I'll have another one of these, please.


1034
01:01:45.253 --> 01:01:47.373
Sure.

1035
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:50.054
You're certainly not as euphoric
as I'd imagined.


1036
01:01:50.133 --> 01:01:54.214
Well, you can't expect me to just
change gears and turn on a dime.


1037
01:01:55.454 --> 01:01:57.374
- Have you changed your mind?
- Mmm.


1038
01:01:58.735 --> 01:02:01.416
- No.
- You haven't met someone else, have you?


1039
01:02:01.536 --> 01:02:03.416
No, no, I haven't.

1040
01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:15.818
I don't understand, fellas.
What... What's going on? What'd I do?


1041
01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:19.579
Yes, those are the ones.
They were in his bookcase.


1042
01:02:19.619 --> 01:02:24.300
He bets every day, and, uh,
and he usually loses.


1043
01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.740
I knew he was into the bookmakers
for a bundle.


1044
01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:29.661
Look, I was with him on Tuesday night
till about 12:00.


1045
01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:33.581
Then suddenly he got a phone call
and he was like a different man.


1046
01:02:33.701 --> 01:02:36.622
if It was anyone else but C.W.,

1047
01:02:36.742 --> 01:02:39.423
we wouldn't even be discussing this.

1048
01:02:39.462 --> 01:02:42.103
The jewels were in his locker.
It's an airtight case.


1049
01:02:42.184 --> 01:02:44.543
Listen, fellas,
I know you guys wanted my job,


1050
01:02:44.584 --> 01:02:47.064
but I could get 30 years
up the river for this.


1051
01:02:47.144 --> 01:02:49.505
With good behavior,
you'll be out in 20.


1052
01:02:49.585 --> 01:02:51.585
I'll get you. No matter where you are.

1053
01:02:51.666 --> 01:02:54.626
I'll check every low-I. Q club in town,
and I'll find you. I'll kill you.


1054
01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:57.066
- Low I. Q Some genius.
- I'll kill these guys.


1055
01:02:57.147 --> 01:02:59.467
- Take it easy.
- I'm not one to give pious lectures,


1056
01:02:59.547 --> 01:03:01.867
but if you needed money,
you could have come to me.


1057
01:03:01.948 --> 01:03:04.668
I would have listened.
I warned you about your gambling habit.


1058
01:03:04.748 --> 01:03:06.869
Can’t you see
what a conspiracy this is?


1059
01:03:06.988 --> 01:03:08.869
They plant a footprint
and a fingerprint,


1060
01:03:08.949 --> 01:03:10.989
and the night watchman
forges my signature.


1061
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:14.830
It's easy. And this crazy girl
who smokes opium makes up a story.


1062
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:16.830
And Fitzgerald plants
the jewels in my apartment.


1063
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:19.591
There's a word for people who think
everyone is conspiring against them.


1064
01:03:19.631 --> 01:03:21.591
- That's right. Perceptive.
- C.W.,


1065
01:03:21.671 --> 01:03:25.112
you tried to swallow the key to
the locker at Grand Central Station...


1066
01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:27.032
where we found the stolen goods.

1067
01:03:27.112 --> 01:03:29.353
- You got any witnesses?
- Yeah, me!


1068
01:03:29.393 --> 01:03:31.553
You gonna take your word over mine?

1069
01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.513
Let's get him over to the courthouse
and book him.


1070
01:03:33.553 --> 01:03:35.433
You better get a lawyer, C.W.

1071
01:03:35.474 --> 01:03:37.394
I'm shocked.
This is one of my best men.


1072
01:03:37.434 --> 01:03:39.795
You know how long I've known this guy?
Tommy, come with me.


1073
01:03:39.834 --> 01:03:42.475
Yeah, Mike, I'm right behind ya.
I'm sorry about this, C.W.


1074
01:03:42.515 --> 01:03:44.476
I'll make the arrangements.
Stick around.


1075
01:04:01.399 --> 01:04:03.439
Well, well, well.

1076
01:04:03.479 --> 01:04:05.759
if It isn't
Mr. Fast-Talkin' Investigator...


1077
01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.721
who got caught with his hand
in the cookie jar.


1078
01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.801
Did I really throw you out of bed?

1079
01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:14.041
Why? You planning on using
the insanity defense?


1080
01:04:14.082 --> 01:04:17.162
Listen, honey, I gotta get some help,
and you're gonna help me.


1081
01:04:17.242 --> 01:04:19.762
- Am I?
- Yes.


1082
01:04:19.802 --> 01:04:21.363
- And what makes you think that?
- This is your kind of thing.


1083
01:04:21.402 --> 01:04:23.003
- And what makes you think that?
- This is your kind of thing.


1084
01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:24.924
This'll look great on your resume.

1085
01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:28.964
A suspected felon, a daring escape from
police headquarters, broad daylight.


1086
01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:31.445
You like this kind of thing.

1087
01:04:31.525 --> 01:04:33.446
Go over to that top drawer over there.

1088
01:04:33.525 --> 01:04:36.126
They took the handcuffs
outta the second drawer from the left.


1089
01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:38.086
- There's gotta be a key in there.
- Nervous.


1090
01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:41.767
See if there's a key.
Go. Hurry up. Come on.


1091
01:04:41.846 --> 01:04:43.767
Don't... Hur...
Gotta make this fast.


1092
01:04:43.888 --> 01:04:45.768
Otherwise, I'm gonna be...
They'll put me away.


1093
01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:48.248
I'll be showering with all men
for the rest of my life.


1094
01:04:48.288 --> 01:04:50.648
Hey, miss, I'm sorry.
No one's allowed in here.


1095
01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.969
You wanna come with me?

1096
01:05:06.052 --> 01:05:07.972
Let's go, miss.
You're not allowed in here.


1097
01:05:08.052 --> 01:05:10.012
Come on. Unless you
wanna get locked up too.


1098
01:05:10.132 --> 01:05:13.413
- I'm sorry things didn't work out, C.W.
- Come on. Let's go.


1099
01:05:13.453 --> 01:05:15.733
- Yeah? You wanna lock me up?
- What's wrong with you?


1100
01:05:15.814 --> 01:05:18.894
- Just take your hands off me!
- Something wrong with you?


1101
01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:48.220
Caroline and I are working on the
details of the separation agreement now.


1102
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.381
I'll be out of the house in two weeks.
The divorce will take longer.


1103
01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:53.941
That's why the agreement
has to be securely in place.


1104
01:05:54.021 --> 01:05:57.142
Otherwise, it could get killed
if we were found together.


1105
01:05:57.222 --> 01:06:00.023
- Where Are you?
- do you think he's really guilty?


1106
01:06:00.102 --> 01:06:04.023
- Is that what you're thinking about?
- I can't shake this uneasy feeling.


1107
01:06:04.103 --> 01:06:06.223
What? That he's innocent?
He was caught red-handed.


1108
01:06:06.304 --> 01:06:08.543
Believe me,
it just doesn't feel right.


1109
01:06:08.624 --> 01:06:12.065
I don't see that snoopy little termite
as a romantic jewel thief.


1110
01:06:12.144 --> 01:06:14.265
Well, I'd hardly call
breaking the law romantic.


1111
01:06:14.385 --> 01:06:16.746
I didn't mean it that way.

1112
01:06:16.785 --> 01:06:19.346
What did you mean? The evidence
against him is overwhelming.


1113
01:06:19.466 --> 01:06:22.387
I don't know what I mean anymore.

1114
01:06:22.467 --> 01:06:24.547
Hello? Yes.

1115
01:06:25.867 --> 01:06:28.868
Yes, he is. Hold on.

1116
01:06:28.948 --> 01:06:30.828
- It's the Coopersmiths.
- Thank you.


1117
01:06:32.229 --> 01:06:34.068
Hello. No.

1118
01:06:35.149 --> 01:06:38.430
Really? Oh... Oh, how?

1119
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:43.431
Okay. Yes, I certainly will.

1120
01:06:43.511 --> 01:06:47.271
if you had any doubts about his
culpability, this should allay them.


1121
01:06:47.352 --> 01:06:49.752
- He escaped.
- He did?


1122
01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:53.073
Slipped out of the handcuffs and leaped
across to the building next door.


1123
01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:56.633
- C.W. Briggs?
- Like a common burglar.


1124
01:06:56.713 --> 01:07:00.354
I'm starting to realize that none of us
really knew him all these years.


1125
01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:02.275
I have to go down
to police headquarters.


1126
01:07:02.354 --> 01:07:04.955
It looks like your little termite
ate his way out.


1127
01:07:20.798 --> 01:07:22.839
- Did you forget...
- Resist the temptation to scream.


1128
01:07:22.918 --> 01:07:26.119
- What Are you doing here,
- you little jewel thief?
- No, I'm not a thief.


1129
01:07:26.199 --> 01:07:28.080
I- I'm suspect.
It's the complete different.


1130
01:07:28.159 --> 01:07:30.880
I'm a very promising suspect,
but I didn't do it,


1131
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.840
and I gotta have time to prove that.

1132
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.240
Other wise, they're gonna lock me up
in a concrete building...


1133
01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:37.481
and you'll only be able
to insult me on visiting days.


1134
01:07:37.562 --> 01:07:40.522
- Why did you come here?
- Because I have no one else to turn to.


1135
01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:42.442
Everybody knows how much you hate me,

1136
01:07:42.522 --> 01:07:44.442
so no one will look for me here.

1137
01:07:44.523 --> 01:07:46.483
I gotta have a place to sleep.
I'm exhausted.


1138
01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.204
You can't sleep here.
I couldn't afford the fumigating bills.


1139
01:07:49.283 --> 01:07:51.204
if you wanna call the police,
call the police.


1140
01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:53.725
I don't care.
You know, I'm sleeping here.


1141
01:07:53.804 --> 01:07:55.684
You wanna call 'em, then call 'em.

1142
01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:04.646
Get me the 11 th Precinct.

1143
01:08:28.651 --> 01:08:31.012
- Hello?
- Miss Fitzgerald?


1144
01:08:31.091 --> 01:08:34.012
- Yes?
- Madagascar.


1145
01:08:35.973 --> 01:08:38.013
You are in a deep trance,

1146
01:08:38.093 --> 01:08:42.094
and you will obey each and every command
the Jade Scorpion gives you.


1147
01:08:42.174 --> 01:08:44.775
You will acquire
all the pertinent security data...


1148
01:08:44.814 --> 01:08:46.895
for the Adrian Greenwood mansion.

1149
01:08:46.975 --> 01:08:51.336
You will proceed there,
and after disabling the security system,


1150
01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:54.136
you will remove all the jewels
from the safe,


1151
01:08:54.257 --> 01:08:56.616
obtaining each and every one of them.

1152
01:08:56.736 --> 01:09:00.617
These jewels you will hide
in your apartment. Is this clear?


1153
01:09:00.698 --> 01:09:02.578
Yes.

1154
01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:02.030
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

1155
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:06.150
No. I've had the strangest dreams.

1156
01:10:06.231 --> 01:10:09.031
That's funny, 'cause I've had some
crazy dreams myself lately.


1157
01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:11.031
I dreamed we were finally together.

1158
01:10:11.111 --> 01:10:13.992
Really? You and Magruder?
It's a match made in heaven.


1159
01:10:14.072 --> 01:10:16.192
By a retarded angel, but in heaven.

1160
01:10:16.273 --> 01:10:20.193
You misunderstand me. I dreamed
you and I finally wound up together.


1161
01:10:20.274 --> 01:10:22.714
You... That's funny,
'cause I didn't hear any screaming.


1162
01:10:22.794 --> 01:10:24.674
From the first minute I met you,

1163
01:10:24.714 --> 01:10:28.915
a voice inside me said
I finally found what I've been
searching for my whole life.


1164
01:10:28.995 --> 01:10:31.636
What's that?
A roach, a vermin, a little inchworm?


1165
01:10:31.715 --> 01:10:34.236
A black... Or did I call you
a black widow spider?


1166
01:10:34.316 --> 01:10:38.957
I knew that sooner or later, you and I
would wind up in each other's arms.


1167
01:10:39.037 --> 01:10:41.798
Hey, have you been gargling
with tequila?


1168
01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:46.278
You're a very romantic man.

1169
01:10:47.439 --> 01:10:49.439
What did you smoke before I woke up?

1170
01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:54.680
Suppose I told you I had
the most passionate crush on you
I've ever felt for any man.


1171
01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.961
I'd fear for my life,
'cause I'd think it was a setup.


1172
01:10:58.001 --> 01:11:01.921
They were playing this song
the first time you and I had
drinks together at Rocky's Bar.


1173
01:11:02.001 --> 01:11:04.002
You remember what they were playing
at Rocky's Bar?


1174
01:11:04.122 --> 01:11:06.522
Not that I didn't have
a good time there, but I didn't.


1175
01:11:06.602 --> 01:11:09.603
My passion for you is so intense,
it scares me.


1176
01:11:09.683 --> 01:11:11.603
Can't you see I've submerged it...

1177
01:11:11.683 --> 01:11:15.324
under a mask of hostile acts
and cruel words?


1178
01:11:15.444 --> 01:11:18.565
Don't worry about it, 'cause I-I-I
never really took it seriously.


1179
01:11:18.604 --> 01:11:21.565
When you said you wanted to crush me
like an insect under your heel,


1180
01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:24.286
that was just your way of saying,
"Back off a little. "


1181
01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:26.406
Couldn't you see I was
just protecting myself?


1182
01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:28.766
- Miss Fitzgerald...
- Call me Betty Ann.


1183
01:11:28.847 --> 01:11:31.888
Look, Betty Ann,
I hate to be a killjoy, but, but, uh...


1184
01:11:31.967 --> 01:11:35.128
If this is some kind of scheme
to take adv... it's not very subtle.


1185
01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:39.009
You're the man I'm gonna marry.
I've known it since the first
moment I laid eyes on you.


1186
01:11:39.089 --> 01:11:40.929
if you're gonna marry me,
we should call Bellevue.


1187
01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:42.889
You need a little
electric shock, honey.


1188
01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.850
- Would you kiss me?
- Me?


1189
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:47.290
You want me to lay
a wet one on you?

1190
01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:50.251
I've always imagined if you took me
in your arms and kissed me,


1191
01:11:50.331 --> 01:11:52.691
I could finally feel those fireworks
people talk about.


1192
01:11:52.811 --> 01:11:56.212
- Is this the way you are
- away from the office?
- What Are you thinking?


1193
01:11:56.292 --> 01:11:58.453
I'm thinking that it's a pity
we hate each other.


1194
01:11:58.493 --> 01:12:01.893
- By now, we could have
- had a large family.
- I'm gonna swoon.


1195
01:12:01.973 --> 01:12:04.214
Steady, steady.
I affect women this way sometimes.


1196
01:12:04.293 --> 01:12:06.134
- I can't stay awake.
- Easy, easy.


1197
01:12:06.214 --> 01:12:09.134
- I just need to rest my head on your shoulder.
- Easy, uh...


1198
01:12:09.214 --> 01:12:11.975
I must remember what soap
I used this morning.


1199
01:12:24.978 --> 01:12:28.659
- What the hell Are you doing here?
- Good morning, sweetheart.


1200
01:12:28.698 --> 01:12:30.979
Don't call me sweetheart.
What's going on?


1201
01:12:31.059 --> 01:12:33.499
I stayed awake all last night...

1202
01:12:33.579 --> 01:12:35.900
thinking about all those things
that you said,


1203
01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.780
and all of that rang
a very deep bell with me.


1204
01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.581
- What?
- There were so many times,


1205
01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:44.182
you know, when we were
arguing in the office,


1206
01:12:44.261 --> 01:12:46.822
and I had the feeling that down deep,

1207
01:12:46.942 --> 01:12:49.663
underneath it all,
you were really crazy about me.


1208
01:12:49.702 --> 01:12:52.183
Crazy about you?
What, were you dropped on your head?


1209
01:12:52.263 --> 01:12:54.263
No, hey, toots, 
I gotta tell you,

1210
01:12:54.383 --> 01:12:57.704
last night, for a cold fish,
you were hot stuff.


1211
01:12:57.784 --> 01:12:59.665
Listen, buster, don't call me "toots. "

1212
01:12:59.744 --> 01:13:01.585
I don't like it
any better than "sweetheart. "


1213
01:13:01.665 --> 01:13:05.465
I'm not one of those available
Annies who sits on your lap
while you give dictation.


1214
01:13:05.546 --> 01:13:08.386
What did you do, sneak in here
and slip into my arms?


1215
01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:12.907
Hey, what's going on? You tried to
undress me last night and kiss me.


1216
01:13:12.987 --> 01:13:16.187
- What Are you talking about?
- You came in here and passed out.
- And now the news.


1217
01:13:16.228 --> 01:13:18.148
- I'm confused.
- The elusive jewel thief...


1218
01:13:18.268 --> 01:13:21.029
responsible for robbing the Kensington
and Dillworth fortunes this week...


1219
01:13:21.108 --> 01:13:22.949
has struck again.

1220
01:13:23.029 --> 01:13:27.750
C.W. Briggs, a former employee
of North Coast Fidelity and
Casualty Company of New York,


1221
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:30.470
is the chief suspect in the robbery
of the latest victim,


1222
01:13:30.511 --> 01:13:32.751
Adrian Greenwood of Manhattan.

1223
01:13:32.831 --> 01:13:35.911
The details of the crime were
the same as the first two this week.


1224
01:13:35.992 --> 01:13:38.392
In addition to over
a million dollars in jewelry,


1225
01:13:38.472 --> 01:13:40.953
the thief got away
with a like amount of cash.


1226
01:13:41.032 --> 01:13:44.073
Police had recovered the jewels
from the earlier burglaries,


1227
01:13:44.153 --> 01:13:47.914
which led to the capture and arrest
of the prime suspect, C.W. Briggs.


1228
01:13:47.993 --> 01:13:49.834
So that's why you escaped
from the police.


1229
01:13:49.914 --> 01:13:53.235
Not to try to prove your innocence,
but because you had unfinished business.


1230
01:13:53.355 --> 01:13:55.275
What kind of business?
I was here with you!


1231
01:13:55.395 --> 01:13:59.196
Yeah, well, for some reason,
I'm having trouble remembering
all of that, but I was asleep.


1232
01:13:59.276 --> 01:14:01.677
Even if you came here to sleep,
you could have awakened,


1233
01:14:01.756 --> 01:14:03.677
robbed these people and then come back.

1234
01:14:03.757 --> 01:14:06.117
- You just used this as a safe haven!
- I could have,


1235
01:14:06.198 --> 01:14:08.118
but I didn't.

1236
01:14:08.198 --> 01:14:10.599
You tried to undress me and kiss me.

1237
01:14:10.638 --> 01:14:12.519
You are feeding me the wrong lie.

1238
01:14:12.558 --> 01:14:14.759
I've never tried
to undress you in my life,


1239
01:14:14.799 --> 01:14:18.120
and I wouldn't kiss you
if we were marooned
on a desert island for 20 years.


1240
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.840
We would never be marooned for 20 years,
'cause after 20 minutes,


1241
01:14:20.881 --> 01:14:22.801
I'd make a bow
and arrow and kill you.

1242
01:14:22.881 --> 01:14:27.042
What Are you thinking? I'm marrying
Chris Magruder, for God's sakes.


1243
01:14:27.121 --> 01:14:29.202
- You are?
- Yes.


1244
01:14:29.282 --> 01:14:31.802
We've set a spring date,
as soon as his divorce is final.


1245
01:14:31.882 --> 01:14:34.523
So if I was undressing you
or trying to kiss you,


1246
01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.524
I must have multiple personalities.

1247
01:14:36.603 --> 01:14:40.884
if you marry Chris Magruder,
you have multiple stupidity.


1248
01:14:40.925 --> 01:14:43.525
Uh, yeah, it must have been
the booze last night,


1249
01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:46.686
but you were like a changed person,
and a much better one.


1250
01:14:46.765 --> 01:14:51.087
I'm gonna take a shower, and if
you're not gone when I get out,
I'm calling my local precinct.


1251
01:14:52.326 --> 01:14:54.807
For one minute,
you dropped your guard.


1252
01:14:54.927 --> 01:14:56.727
You were actually sexy,

1253
01:14:56.808 --> 01:14:59.128
even though when the light
hit you a certain way,


1254
01:14:59.168 --> 01:15:01.248
you, you tend to resemble Mussolini.

1255
01:15:02.329 --> 01:15:04.369
Sh...

1256
01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:13.251
Pretty snazzy for an office worker.

1257
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:16.771
Boy, Magruder must really
love you in an extravagant way.


1258
01:15:18.531 --> 01:15:22.053
Probably likes going to Paris with you
more than he does with his wife.


1259
01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.855
I understand you and
Charlie got something for me.


1260
01:15:35.935 --> 01:15:38.055
I don't know about Charlie,
but I came up with a name.


1261
01:15:38.136 --> 01:15:40.536
Really? Well, hit me. Lay it on me.

1262
01:15:40.576 --> 01:15:43.096
Eddie Polgar.

1263
01:15:43.136 --> 01:15:45.016
Eddie Polgar. Who's that?

1264
01:15:45.057 --> 01:15:47.897
It don't mean a thing to me,
but it's come up twice.


1265
01:15:47.937 --> 01:15:50.818
- Eddie Polgar?
- Yeah, yeah. There's no police record.


1266
01:15:50.858 --> 01:15:54.459
Could be an alias.
I don't know. It's all I could get.


1267
01:15:54.498 --> 01:15:56.459
Hey, hey, hey. 
Blue men coming.

1268
01:15:56.539 --> 01:15:58.420
Keep moving. Keep moving!

1269
01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:02.500
- Charlie.
- C.W., is that you?


1270
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.661
- I got a message you wanted me.
- You're hot as a pistol.


1271
01:16:05.701 --> 01:16:09.502
"Hot"? The New York City Police want
to give me a lifetime achievement award.


1272
01:16:10.742 --> 01:16:13.742
Name Eddie Polgar
mean anything to you?


1273
01:16:13.822 --> 01:16:17.703
- Zero.
- Nothin'. I can't get
a break, no matter what I do.


1274
01:16:17.784 --> 01:16:20.664
- Stick your hand in the cup.
- In the cup?


1275
01:16:20.744 --> 01:16:23.265
In the cup. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1276
01:16:23.344 --> 01:16:26.185
Yeah.

1277
01:16:26.225 --> 01:16:28.466
Thirty- eight cents and a wad of paper.

1278
01:16:28.545 --> 01:16:31.186
Oh, and somebody threw their gum away
in your business establishment.


1279
01:16:31.306 --> 01:16:33.586
Well, open the wad of paper.

1280
01:16:34.826 --> 01:16:36.867
- Why?
- It's a clue.


1281
01:16:36.947 --> 01:16:39.627
- What kind of clue?
- From last night's heist.


1282
01:16:39.667 --> 01:16:42.508
Coopersmiths found it
on the driveway on the property.


1283
01:16:45.508 --> 01:16:49.109
- Charlie, wh...
- The burglar dropped it getting away.


1284
01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:51.790
- How'd you get it?
- I got a friend, who's got a friend...


1285
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:55.191
who works in the same building
as the Coopersmith Agency.


1286
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:57.751
- I thought maybe you'd want it.
- Charlie, this is...


1287
01:16:57.831 --> 01:17:00.112
These earrings are grand larceny.

1288
01:17:00.152 --> 01:17:02.552
I see by the look on your face
I must've helped you.


1289
01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.953
Cherchezla femme.
You know what that means, Charlie?


1290
01:17:07.073 --> 01:17:09.673
- What?
- Find the woman.


1291
01:17:09.754 --> 01:17:14.234
- Is there a woman?
- Well, first I thought so.


1292
01:17:14.314 --> 01:17:17.515
Then I didn't.
Now I think I got her.


1293
01:17:18.795 --> 01:17:20.675
You work next to a person for years,

1294
01:17:20.756 --> 01:17:22.596
and then one day
the temptation's too great.


1295
01:17:22.676 --> 01:17:25.356
- I don't believe it. Not C.W.
- It doesn't make sense.
- Why not?


1296
01:17:25.397 --> 01:17:28.718
Jill, I don't think any of us
expected it, but there is proof now.


1297
01:17:28.797 --> 01:17:31.237
You heard Fitzgerald saw the jewels
sittin' in his apartment, right?


1298
01:17:31.318 --> 01:17:34.558
Yeah, and how he fought the cops
when they got the key to his locker.


1299
01:17:34.678 --> 01:17:36.519
- To me it's open-and-shut.
- What?


1300
01:17:36.599 --> 01:17:40.399
- You don't run from the police
- if you're innocent.
- That's what I'm sayin'.


1301
01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.320
What about the nerve it took
to strike twice? Come on, guys.


1302
01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.761
C.W. deserves some credit.
He turned out to be a pretty gutsy guy.


1303
01:17:51.162 --> 01:17:52.201
Hello. Where Are you?

1304
01:17:52.242 --> 01:17:54.522
Hello. Where Are you?

1305
01:17:54.602 --> 01:17:58.082
Never mind where I am.
I gotta get up to the office.


1306
01:17:59.444 --> 01:18:02.964
I- I think there's more people
involved in this thing.


1307
01:18:03.044 --> 01:18:06.165
I- I-I-I think that Fitzgerald
is behind it.


1308
01:18:06.204 --> 01:18:08.565
Does the name...

1309
01:18:08.605 --> 01:18:11.525
Eddie Polgar mean anything to you?

1310
01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:12.966
No.

1311
01:18:13.045 --> 01:18:15.006
Look, I gotta get up to the office.

1312
01:18:15.126 --> 01:18:17.046
I wanna get through
the Coopersmiths' report.


1313
01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:21.127
I wanna check it out, and I wanna
check out Fitzgerald's desk again.


1314
01:18:29.849 --> 01:18:31.770
There's no question about it.

1315
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:34.810
Fitzgerald is involved in this thing
up to her neck.


1316
01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:38.771
You can't let this woman and your
feelings for her color your judgment.


1317
01:18:38.851 --> 01:18:41.171
It has nothing to do
with my feelings for her.


1318
01:18:41.252 --> 01:18:43.491
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.


1319
01:18:43.572 --> 01:18:47.133
I go over to her house because I figured
no one will look for me there...


1320
01:18:47.212 --> 01:18:49.093
'cause she hates me so.

1321
01:18:49.173 --> 01:18:52.774
I go to sleep. In the middle of the
night, I hear a noise, and I wake up.


1322
01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:56.414
I find her. I figure,
"All right, so she can't sleep either. "


1323
01:18:56.454 --> 01:18:58.375
But no. That's not what it is.

1324
01:18:58.454 --> 01:19:02.536
She had done the Greenwood heist, and
she was coming back, and I caught her.


1325
01:19:02.615 --> 01:19:05.256
So naturally she starts
to act very peculiar.


1326
01:19:05.297 --> 01:19:07.337
You know, she starts to...
I trap her.


1327
01:19:07.416 --> 01:19:09.977
So she starts seducing me
with her feminine wiles.


1328
01:19:10.057 --> 01:19:13.017
- Meaning what?
- Meaning all of a sudden I'm handsome...


1329
01:19:13.098 --> 01:19:15.538
and I'm gorgeous and she
can't take her hands off...


1330
01:19:15.658 --> 01:19:17.658
Does that sound like Fitzgerald to you,

1331
01:19:17.739 --> 01:19:21.539
or a schemer trying
to play me for a sucker?


1332
01:19:21.659 --> 01:19:26.100
Actually, it sounds like that magic show
demonstration by Voltan Polgar.


1333
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.821
That's right.
That was the night of the first robbery.


1334
01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.741
I don't know, C.W. I think
she has some real feelings for you.


1335
01:19:31.821 --> 01:19:34.261
Don't be ridiculous.
She hates me.


1336
01:19:34.342 --> 01:19:37.982
Wh- Wh-What is the name you said
of, of the magician...


1337
01:19:38.063 --> 01:19:40.703
who now I've completely repressed?

1338
01:19:40.783 --> 01:19:42.744
Uh, Voltan.

1339
01:19:42.823 --> 01:19:45.904
Voltan the Inscrutable.
The Jade Scorpion.


1340
01:19:45.984 --> 01:19:48.985
- What is his name?
- Voltan Polgar.


1341
01:19:49.104 --> 01:19:51.545
Eli Voytak Polgar.

1342
01:19:53.345 --> 01:19:55.746
I'm... just theorizing...

1343
01:19:55.826 --> 01:19:59.587
on an incredible
sequence of events.


1344
01:19:59.667 --> 01:20:03.267
You look like my Uncle Jerry right after
the United Parcel truck hit him.


1345
01:20:03.347 --> 01:20:07.628
What happened? I know you described
this before, but, but what happened?


1346
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:11.229
Th- They brought me on stage...
brought me onstage.


1347
01:20:11.309 --> 01:20:14.630
He put you into a trance...
rather easily, despite your resistance.


1348
01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:16.710
Right. Yes. And then...

1349
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:20.311
And then he brought Fitzgerald,
who was with me at the time...


1350
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:23.831
And then you were awakened
in a posthypnotic state...


1351
01:20:23.951 --> 01:20:26.712
with a word that would, uh,
put you back under again.


1352
01:20:26.752 --> 01:20:30.033
Constantinople. Yeah,
then he started making these...


1353
01:20:34.633 --> 01:20:38.035
C.W.? C.W.?

1354
01:20:38.074 --> 01:20:39.994
Yes?

1355
01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.995
You okay?

1356
01:20:42.075 --> 01:20:46.116
I'm fine, Alvin.
How's your aging mother?


1357
01:20:46.156 --> 01:20:49.557
Obviously, he was never
released from the keyword.


1358
01:20:49.637 --> 01:20:52.077
Wake him up, George.
This is scary.


1359
01:20:52.157 --> 01:20:55.438
Don't be scared.
This stuff's right up my alley.


1360
01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:58.838
All right. Now, when I snap my fingers,
you will awaken.


1361
01:20:58.958 --> 01:21:03.039
Uh, you'll have no memory of what
has occurred. Is that clear to you?


1362
01:21:03.079 --> 01:21:05.079
- Yes.
- And you'll awaken...


1363
01:21:05.119 --> 01:21:07.240
feeling happy and, and, and refreshed.

1364
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.640
- Is that clear?
- Yes.


1365
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.361
So, the guy gets me onstage.

1366
01:21:13.441 --> 01:21:16.242
- Now, then what?
- What took place after that?
- Wait a minute.


1367
01:21:16.321 --> 01:21:18.282
I have an idea. 
Constantinople.

1368
01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:23.163
My God. What a sense of power.

1369
01:21:23.243 --> 01:21:25.683
do you think that you can get him
to recall everything...


1370
01:21:25.764 --> 01:21:28.684
- and then set him loose
- from the trance for good?
- All right.


1371
01:21:28.804 --> 01:21:31.925
Now, when I snap my fingers,
you will awaken.


1372
01:21:32.005 --> 01:21:34.845
Your memory will be clear...
crystal clear.


1373
01:21:34.885 --> 01:21:38.486
All the events of the past week
will come to you vividly...


1374
01:21:38.566 --> 01:21:40.526
and with no distraction.

1375
01:21:40.606 --> 01:21:42.847
You'll be completely freed
from your trance,


1376
01:21:42.887 --> 01:21:44.927
and the mention
of the word Constantinople...


1377
01:21:44.968 --> 01:21:46.848
will have absolutely no meaning to you.

1378
01:21:46.888 --> 01:21:50.648
It will not put you back
into your hypnotic state.


1379
01:21:51.889 --> 01:21:54.570
One: You're coming out of it.

1380
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:58.890
Two: Your memories of
the past week are coming back.


1381
01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:01.411
Three: You're fully awake.

1382
01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:07.212
- I took the jewels!
- The... The Kensington jewels.
- What?


1383
01:22:07.292 --> 01:22:09.572
And the Dill... Yes.
Yes, and of course.


1384
01:22:09.612 --> 01:22:12.572
And then he probably tried to get me...
couldn't get me, so he...


1385
01:22:12.653 --> 01:22:14.733
The Greenwood thing was her. Wha...

1386
01:22:14.813 --> 01:22:17.214
What is Fitzgerald's keyword?

1387
01:22:17.294 --> 01:22:19.214
Madagascar.

1388
01:22:19.294 --> 01:22:22.415
The Jade Scorpion
wants you to get the jewels.


1389
01:22:22.495 --> 01:22:26.816
Wrap them in plain brown paper
and bring them to him.


1390
01:22:26.896 --> 01:22:29.296
Mark down the following address
in Chinatown.


1391
01:23:01.263 --> 01:23:03.143
Miss Fitzgerald?

1392
01:23:04.343 --> 01:23:06.223
Miss Fitzgerald?

1393
01:23:08.464 --> 01:23:10.384
Miss Fitzgerald?

1394
01:23:20.946 --> 01:23:23.627
Sergeant, his name is Voltan Polgar.

1395
01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:25.948
Somebody just gave me
an address on him.


1396
01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:45.471
Oh, Miss Fitzgerald.

1397
01:23:45.551 --> 01:23:47.711
The Jade Scorpion welcomes you.

1398
01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:50.352
- You have my package.
- Yes.


1399
01:23:52.792 --> 01:23:54.632
Thank you.

1400
01:23:54.713 --> 01:23:57.593
You will now return home.
You will go to sleep.


1401
01:23:57.634 --> 01:24:01.034
It will be a wonderful sleep
from which you will awaken cheerfully,


1402
01:24:01.114 --> 01:24:03.275
and you will remember nothing
of these events.


1403
01:24:03.395 --> 01:24:05.955
In fact, you will have no memory
of any of this ever.


1404
01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:19.838
I was just passing through.
I... thought I'd... say hello.


1405
01:24:19.918 --> 01:24:21.798
- C.W. Briggs.
- Yeah.


1406
01:24:21.838 --> 01:24:23.878
I seem to have underestimated you.

1407
01:24:23.959 --> 01:24:26.919
Story of my life.
Everybody underestimates me.


1408
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.040
They... You know,
they think I'm a pushover.


1409
01:24:29.119 --> 01:24:31.200
It makes my work much easier.

1410
01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.681
I- I've seen some pretty exotic schemes,
Polgar, but this one was a beauty.


1411
01:24:34.761 --> 01:24:38.041
But I figured it out.
That's why I get top dollar.


1412
01:24:38.122 --> 01:24:39.162
Don't force me to take
extreme measures, Mr. Briggs.


1413
01:24:39.202 --> 01:24:42.522
Don't force me to take
extreme measures, Mr. Briggs.


1414
01:24:42.602 --> 01:24:44.482
You'd never pull that trigger.

1415
01:24:44.563 --> 01:24:46.443
Really? You think not. Why?

1416
01:24:46.563 --> 01:24:49.803
Murder's not your game. I have
just an instinct that tells me that.


1417
01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.764
You know, you're a jewel thief.

1418
01:24:51.844 --> 01:24:54.724
There's a big difference between doing
a little time for stealing jewels...


1419
01:24:54.805 --> 01:24:57.645
and, you know, frying
in the electric chair.


1420
01:24:57.726 --> 01:25:01.606
Once they pump 200 million volts
of electricity through your body,


1421
01:25:01.686 --> 01:25:05.127
you have a tendency to spend
the rest of your days in an ashtray.


1422
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:22.930
For a minute, I thought
I overplayed my hand.


1423
01:25:29.412 --> 01:25:31.371
You're the bravest, most brilliant,

1424
01:25:31.412 --> 01:25:33.452
most courageous man I've ever met,

1425
01:25:33.533 --> 01:25:36.852
and I would go to the end
of the earth with you.


1426
01:25:36.893 --> 01:25:40.573
You know, everybody should have somebody
that they feel that way about.


1427
01:25:40.654 --> 01:25:43.454
It's... It's... You know, it's such
a shame that you're gonna have to...


1428
01:25:43.534 --> 01:25:47.295
actually wake up from this,
this fabulous illusion.


1429
01:25:48.975 --> 01:25:51.135
Just...Just once...

1430
01:25:51.255 --> 01:25:55.136
before the ugly curtain of reality...

1431
01:25:55.256 --> 01:25:57.137
drops on both of us.

1432
01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.580
Oh, you kiss great.

1433
01:26:19.861 --> 01:26:23.062
- What a wrap-up, huh?
- Did you see the look
- on Herb Coopersmith's face?


1434
01:26:23.142 --> 01:26:25.022
- Serves him right.
- Hey, Al.


1435
01:26:25.062 --> 01:26:26.983
Where do you think Miss Fitzgerald
and Mr. Magruder...


1436
01:26:27.103 --> 01:26:29.023
are gonna go
for their romantic getaway?


1437
01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:32.584
His divorce doesn't come
through for months. I hear
his wife couldn't care less.


1438
01:26:32.664 --> 01:26:34.464
- I hear they're gettin' married in June.
- No.


1439
01:26:34.544 --> 01:26:36.505
I think I heard him
talking about going to Paris.


1440
01:26:36.544 --> 01:26:38.385
Paris? Wow!

1441
01:26:41.505 --> 01:26:44.546
Mr. Magruder, I'm...
I just came to say I'm leaving.


1442
01:26:44.626 --> 01:26:48.587
Ah, C.W. Well, what can I say?
We all make mistakes, huh?


1443
01:26:48.667 --> 01:26:52.108
'Course, you've gotta admit, they did
have a pretty strong case against you.


1444
01:26:52.187 --> 01:26:54.908
- I don't know.
- I know you could get a job anywhere.


1445
01:26:54.988 --> 01:26:56.868
if you decide to go,
you'll have our blessings.


1446
01:26:56.909 --> 01:26:58.789
if you stay, you'll have a raise,

1447
01:26:58.829 --> 01:27:01.509
and I'll see to it Miss Fitzgerald
keeps out of your way.


1448
01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:05.350
Between us boys, once we marry,
she's gonna retire
whether she wants to or not.


1449
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:09.191
I'm not having a wife at work
in my own office, for good measure.


1450
01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:12.272
Well, think positively. I'll be away
for a couple of weeks myself.


1451
01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:14.232
Miss Fitzgerald and I
are going to Paris.


1452
01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.673
- Oh, yes? The actual city?
- Huh?


1453
01:27:16.712 --> 01:27:18.792
- No. Nothing.
- You need a vacation.


1454
01:27:18.873 --> 01:27:21.713
Why don't you see if you can get
that Laura Kensington girl to go with?


1455
01:27:21.793 --> 01:27:23.914
I wouldn't mind
some of that action myself.


1456
01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:25.834
She seems struck by you.

1457
01:27:25.954 --> 01:27:30.915
She's a little demented, but, in
a hotel room, that can be a lot of fun.


1458
01:27:34.956 --> 01:27:36.836
Just came to say good-bye.

1459
01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:39.797
Right. Chris and I
have a plane to catch.


1460
01:27:39.877 --> 01:27:43.038
No, by good-bye I mean I'm leaving.
I'm quitting.


1461
01:27:44.078 --> 01:27:45.958
Oh?

1462
01:27:46.038 --> 01:27:49.359
Should make you very happy.
You can en joy your vacation now.


1463
01:27:49.399 --> 01:27:52.360
'Cause when you come back,
you don't have to see me again.


1464
01:27:52.439 --> 01:27:54.840
You can revamp everything here.
No static.


1465
01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.281
Want to have a parting drink?

1466
01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:02.601
A drink at 10:00 in the morning?

1467
01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:06.322
It's only tequila.

1468
01:28:06.362 --> 01:28:11.923
What can you say about a woman who keeps
a bottle of Mexican booze in her desk?


1469
01:28:11.963 --> 01:28:15.084
Let's drink to both of our futures.

1470
01:28:15.124 --> 01:28:17.844
Yeah?

1471
01:28:17.885 --> 01:28:21.165
Today, Mr. Magruder.
Tomorrow, the world.


1472
01:28:21.205 --> 01:28:23.766
I will let that pass
because this is good-bye.


1473
01:28:23.845 --> 01:28:26.646
Mm. You're really gonna marry him?

1474
01:28:26.726 --> 01:28:28.567
I
- I... You know.

1475
01:28:28.646 --> 01:28:30.967
For a brilliant woman, I gotta say,

1476
01:28:31.087 --> 01:28:34.127
you have the worst taste in men.

1477
01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:37.048
I didn't take up with you.
How bad could my taste be?


1478
01:28:38.808 --> 01:28:42.009
You know, behind...
underneath all those nasty remarks...


1479
01:28:42.089 --> 01:28:45.089
is a very vulnerable,
sweet, sexy woman.


1480
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:46.970
But don't ever let it come out,

1481
01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:50.010
because, you know, you could
run the risk of being happy,


1482
01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:51.931
and I know that would kill ya.

1483
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:53.932
Chris and I plan
on being very happy.


1484
01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:56.492
Your instinct told you
he would never leave his wife.


1485
01:28:56.572 --> 01:28:59.492
My instincts are good,
but they're not infallible.


1486
01:28:59.573 --> 01:29:02.533
So this was one where I was wrong.

1487
01:29:02.653 --> 01:29:04.693
Have a... Have a terrific
rest of your life...


1488
01:29:04.814 --> 01:29:07.374
and try not to jump
out of any windows.


1489
01:29:07.454 --> 01:29:09.654
Make sure the elevator's there
before you get in,


1490
01:29:09.695 --> 01:29:13.495
because I heard of a man who plunged

1491
01:29:13.576 --> 01:29:16.416
I'll let that pass
'cause this is good-bye.


1492
01:29:20.817 --> 01:29:22.937
- That's what she said...
- Hey, Briggsie, I was just tellin' 'em.


1493
01:29:22.977 --> 01:29:24.978
You quit, I go with ya.

1494
01:29:25.058 --> 01:29:28.578
That's right. C.W., you are
our hero. This was a tough nut to crack.


1495
01:29:28.658 --> 01:29:30.498
No, this was all luck.

1496
01:29:30.579 --> 01:29:33.179
If George didn't know
magic or hypnosis,


1497
01:29:33.259 --> 01:29:35.340
you know,
I never would have known anything.


1498
01:29:35.459 --> 01:29:37.340
It's an amazing thing.

1499
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:40.701
You can actually put somebody
under and then force them to do
the most outrageous things.


1500
01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.661
That is absolutely wrong.

1501
01:29:42.701 --> 01:29:46.141
A person will not do
anything under hypnosis that
they wouldn't do in real life.


1502
01:29:46.182 --> 01:29:48.262
- Is that true?
- Yeah.
- What Are you saying?


1503
01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:50.382
Th
- Th
-That I'm, at heart, a thief?

1504
01:29:50.463 --> 01:29:54.783
Well, we know there's
a little bit of larceny in you.


1505
01:29:54.864 --> 01:29:57.824
I mean, you're the one who's always
saying it takes one to catch one.


1506
01:29:57.864 --> 01:30:00.865
Oh, well, there's also a little bit
of larceny in Miss Fitzgerald.


1507
01:30:00.944 --> 01:30:02.825
I mean, that was kind of a shock.

1508
01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:06.506
- There's a lot of surprises in her,
- it turns out.
- Hey, come here.


1509
01:30:06.626 --> 01:30:07.906
Hey.

1510
01:30:07.946 --> 01:30:08.866
Hey.

1511
01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:11.307
You got a little crush
on her, don't ya?


1512
01:30:11.386 --> 01:30:13.627
Who? Fitzgerald?
What, are you...


1513
01:30:13.707 --> 01:30:17.108
- What Are you talking about?
- Well, come on. I've always known it.


1514
01:30:17.188 --> 01:30:19.148
You can't hate somebody that much
without there being...


1515
01:30:19.228 --> 01:30:21.349
at least a little bit of attraction
underneath it all.


1516
01:30:21.429 --> 01:30:24.189
- Says who?
- It's my instinct. Against all logic.


1517
01:30:24.269 --> 01:30:27.070
Come on, Briggsie. You were the one
who taught me to trust it.


1518
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:31.430
I think I'm in
love with her, but I...

1519
01:30:31.511 --> 01:30:34.831
It's the stupidest thing that's ever
happened to me. It's embarrassing.


1520
01:30:34.871 --> 01:30:37.632
Yeah, well, uh, you better take
the bull by the horns.


1521
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:39.432
She's out of here in about
three minutes. Look.


1522
01:30:44.073 --> 01:30:45.914
Go!

1523
01:30:50.394 --> 01:30:53.795
Miss Fitzgerald, marry me.

1524
01:30:53.875 --> 01:30:56.275
- What?
- I guess C.W.'s had a few.


1525
01:30:56.355 --> 01:30:59.476
- Pretty early for that, don't you think?
- I've had a little tequila, but...


1526
01:30:59.556 --> 01:31:01.557
Otherwise I wouldn't have
the nerve to say this.


1527
01:31:01.636 --> 01:31:03.477
I'm in love with you.
I want you to marry me.


1528
01:31:03.557 --> 01:31:05.398
Mr. Briggs, you're embarrassing me.

1529
01:31:05.477 --> 01:31:08.118
You don't want to spend the rest of
your life with the wrong person...


1530
01:31:08.198 --> 01:31:10.999
- when it's me you really love.
- C.W., you're making her uncomfortable.


1531
01:31:11.078 --> 01:31:15.479
Whatever could make you think
I could, in my wildest dreams,
think of you that way, you...


1532
01:31:15.559 --> 01:31:18.319
Yeah, I know. " Nearsighted little
cockroach, " or something like that.


1533
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.680
But can't you see the venom under that?
That's the beauty.


1534
01:31:20.761 --> 01:31:22.840
Betty, let's go.
C.W. leave here at once.


1535
01:31:22.961 --> 01:31:26.081
I think your idea of moving
on professionally wasn't so crazy.


1536
01:31:26.161 --> 01:31:28.042
Hey, look, I'm opening up to you.

1537
01:31:28.122 --> 01:31:30.002
I'm putting my heart in your hands.

1538
01:31:30.042 --> 01:31:33.323
I've been difficult because
I feared you, just like you feared me.


1539
01:31:33.402 --> 01:31:36.443
Because underneath, we know this is
the real thing, and it terrifies us.


1540
01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:38.444
Yes, I fear you.
You and Boris Karloff.


1541
01:31:38.524 --> 01:31:40.404
Out of the way, C.W.

1542
01:31:40.444 --> 01:31:42.805
Your heroics do not entitle you
to be an obnoxious boor.


1543
01:31:42.845 --> 01:31:45.645
How can a man confessing love
be an obnoxious boor?


1544
01:31:45.725 --> 01:31:48.606
I'm afraid Betty and I have big plans,

1545
01:31:48.686 --> 01:31:50.566
and they don't include you.

1546
01:31:50.646 --> 01:31:53.446
I- I... You wanna spend the rest of
your life married to the wrong guy?


1547
01:31:53.527 --> 01:31:56.367
What makes you think I'd marry you
even if I wasn't gonna marry him?


1548
01:31:56.447 --> 01:31:59.248
- Stop talking about me
- like I'm not here.
- Because it's me you love.


1549
01:31:59.327 --> 01:32:02.449
You are too old for me.
You are too nearsighted for me.


1550
01:32:02.528 --> 01:32:04.929
- You're too short for me.
- You're leaving out the best part.


1551
01:32:05.009 --> 01:32:08.090
- I'm also losing my hair.
- All right, C.W. Good-bye.


1552
01:32:08.169 --> 01:32:10.330
- And I mean for good.
- Wait... Wait a minute.


1553
01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:13.691
Betty Ann. Betty Ann,
where are you going?


1554
01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:17.532
- Madagascar?
- Someone call the plane
and tell them we might be late.


1555
01:32:19.412 --> 01:32:21.372
You go ahead, Chris.

1556
01:32:22.972 --> 01:32:24.893
I'm staying here.

1557
01:32:24.973 --> 01:32:27.173
What?

1558
01:32:27.253 --> 01:32:29.093
I'm staying with C.W.

1559
01:32:30.213 --> 01:32:32.054
We have an announcement to make.

1560
01:32:34.054 --> 01:32:37.535
Betty Ann, you have
a crazy look in your eye.


1561
01:32:37.615 --> 01:32:40.296
I've never felt
so normal in my life.


1562
01:32:40.376 --> 01:32:44.537
I can't guarantee that every time
I kiss you there's gonna be fireworks.


1563
01:32:44.616 --> 01:32:48.377
I think I fell in love with you
the first second I laid eyes on you.


1564
01:32:48.457 --> 01:32:51.298
I want this woman helped!
Get an ambulance!


1565
01:32:51.378 --> 01:32:54.699
Uh, Miss Burke. Call my wife's attorney.
Have him halt the separation.


1566
01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:57.340
- I see trouble on the horizon.
- Don't worry, Mr. Magruder.


1567
01:32:57.419 --> 01:33:00.740
She'll take you back. There'll be a few
new ground rules, but you can adapt.


1568
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.501
- Gosh, so much passion
- in a lousy insurance office.
- I know.


1569
01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.421
- No kiddin'.
- You never know.


1570
01:33:06.461 --> 01:33:08.901
Hey. Congratulations.

1571
01:33:10.622 --> 01:33:12.622
A little, uh,
going- away present forya.


1572
01:33:15.583 --> 01:33:17.784
So, should we...

1573
01:33:17.863 --> 01:33:22.424
get out of here and find someplace where
we can start making up for lost time?


1574
01:33:22.504 --> 01:33:24.944
How about my place?

1575
01:33:25.025 --> 01:33:27.345
I think I can live with that.

1576
01:33:27.425 --> 01:33:29.465
Um, God bless everyone,

1577
01:33:29.586 --> 01:33:32.626
and, uh, God bless Tiny Tim.

1578
01:33:32.706 --> 01:33:35.027
- Shall we?
- Good luck, you two.


1579
01:33:37.187 --> 01:33:39.267
Hey, so, what's gonna happen
when she, you know,


1580
01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.428
wakes up and she's back
to her old self?


1581
01:33:41.508 --> 01:33:44.909
Guess the first word out of his mouth
every morning has to be " Madagascar. "


1582
01:33:44.949 --> 01:33:47.629
My gosh, who'd have thunk it.

1583
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:49.870
Hey, what a break for C.W.
that in all the commotion...


1584
01:33:49.909 --> 01:33:52.190
you forgot to deprogram
Miss Fitzgerald, huh?


1585
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:57.551
What are you talking about?
I didn't forget anything.
I deprogrammed her last night.


1586
01:33:57.631 --> 01:33:59.912
You don't have to worry.
I'll never leave you.


1587
01:33:59.991 --> 01:34:01.952
It's something you don't even
have to think about.


1588
01:34:02.072 --> 01:34:03.912
Tell me how you feel about me.

1589
01:34:03.992 --> 01:34:09.634
You're the most wonderful man
in the world... the handsomest,
the most brilliant, the sexiest.


1590
01:34:09.713 --> 01:34:12.234
You know, someday I'm gonna
make you feel those things.


1591
01:34:12.314 --> 01:34:14.274
Just, just really feel them.

1592
01:34:14.796 --> 01:34:20.089
Anything's possible.And if you feel thay way,
I don't even have to say Constationaple
