1
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.260
Our pasta this evening...

2
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.930
is squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth...


3
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.230
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.


4
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.690
For entrees this evening, I have
swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade,


5
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.110
rare roasted partridge breast in
raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.


6
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.400
...and grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.


7
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.280
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.


8
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.000
God, I hate this place. It's a chick's
restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia ?


9
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.


10
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.170
Is that Reed Robinson
over there ?


11
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.300
- Are you freebasing or what ?
That's not Robinson. Well, who is it then ?


12
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.340
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.


13
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.800
Paul Allen's on the other side
of the room over there.


14
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.890
Who's he with ?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.


15
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.810
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.


16
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.770
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there ?
Yes, McDufus, I am.


17
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.350
- He's handling the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.


18
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.850
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything ?


19
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.860
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...


20
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.030
talking on the phone to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.


21
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.570
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.


22
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.570
Oh, my God, Bateman.

23
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.660
Do you want me to fry you up some
fucking potato pancakes ? Some latkes ?


24
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.410
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.


25
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.620
Oh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.


26
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.580
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.


27
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.130
Speaking of reasonable--
Only $570.


28
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.170
That's not bad.

29
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.300
A little something
for the purse.


30
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.300
Give her the 50.

31
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.300
Stoli on the rocks.

32
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.720
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.


33
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.090
That'll be $25.

34
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.310
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

35
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.020
I wanna stab you to death...

36
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.640
and play around
with your blood.


37
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.530
What can I get
for you two ?


38
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.390
I live in the
American Gardens building...


39
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.970
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.


40
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.180
My name is Patrick Bateman.

41
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.190
I'm 27 years old.

42
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.560
I believe in
taking care of myself,


43
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.570
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.


44
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.030
ln the morning,
if my face is a little pufffy,


45
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.200
I'll put on an icepack
while doing my stomach crunches.


46
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.200
I can do a thousand now.

47
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.760
After I remove the icepack,
I use a deeppore cleanser lotion.


48
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.100
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.


49
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.770
Then
a honey-almond bodyscrub.


50
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.600
And on the face,
an exfoliating gelscrub.


51
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.610
Then I apply
an herb mint facialmasque,


52
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.700
which lleave on forten minutes
while I prepare the rest of my routine.


53
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.290
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,


54
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.130
because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older.


55
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.170
Then moisturizer,

56
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.210
then an anti-aging eye balm,

57
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.800
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.


58
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.470
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.


59
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.680
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.


60
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.690
Only an entity--
something illusory.


61
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.310
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...


62
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.570
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...


63
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.450
and may be you can even sense
our life styles are probably comparable,


64
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.820
I simply am not there.

65
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.720
Good morning.

66
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.970
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.


67
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.730
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages ?


68
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.320
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what he was cancelling or why.


69
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.820
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else ?


70
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.160
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties, Pier 17. When ?


71
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.280
After 6:00.
And what should I say ? Negative. Cancel it.


72
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.200
Just say "no"
Just say "no" ?


73
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.000
Okay, Jean.

74
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.580
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,


75
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.590
and if not there
try Crayons.


76
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.170
Allright ?
Yes, sir.


77
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.630
Oh, wait. And I need reservations
for two at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.


78
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.640
Something romantic ?

79
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.800
No.

80
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.350
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.


81
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.390
No, I'll do it.
No, no.


82
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.650
Be a doll and just get me a mineral
water, okay ? You look nice today.


83
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.320
Don't wear that outfit again.

84
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.360
What ? I didn't hear you.

85
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.070
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.


86
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.160
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it.


87
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.490
Come on.
You're prettier than that.


88
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.000
- Thanks, Patrick.
- I'm not here.


89
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.830
And high heels.
I like high heels.


90
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.630
Feathered friends for 600.

91
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.010
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...


92
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.930
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.


93
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.780
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.


94
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.200
And lots of
chocolate truffles,


95
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.660
Godiva, and oysters
in the halfshell.


96
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.660
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,


97
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.160
but Evelyn, my supposed fiance,
keeps buzzing in my ear.


98
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.620
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.


99
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.000
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.


100
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.300
Patrick,
we should do it.


101
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.800
Do what ?
Get married. Have a wedding.


102
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.050
No. I can't take
the time off work.


103
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.550
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.


104
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.350
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.


105
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.350
I don't see why
you just don't quit.


106
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.940
Because I want to fit in.

107
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.160
Williams party.

108
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.200
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,


109
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.240
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.


110
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.830
But we do, and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.


111
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.170
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.


112
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.550
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.


113
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.170
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.


114
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.510
Okay. Allright.

115
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.640
I'm fairly certain that...

116
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.100
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.


117
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.020
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.


118
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.560
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...


119
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.690
I'm having an affair with Courtney
Rawlinson, her closest friend.


120
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.740
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.


121
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.360
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.


122
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.870
Tonight, I believe, it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.


123
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.080
More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged...


124
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.710
to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus
in the business.


125
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.040
Tell me, Stash.

126
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.670
Do you think Soho is becoming too...
commercial ?


127
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.050
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass ?


128
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.090
Hey, that affects us.

129
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.140
Well, what about the massacres in Sri
Lanka, honey ? Doesn't that affect us too ?


130
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.140
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka ?


131
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.310
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there ?


132
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.390
Come on, Bryce.

133
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.810
There are a lot more important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.


134
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.480
- Like what ?
- Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,


135
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.900
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.


136
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.780
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless...


137
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.080
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,


138
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.950
while also promoting
equal rights for women.


139
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.410
We have to encourage
a return...


140
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.120
to traditional moral values.

141
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.590
Most importantly,

142
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.960
we have to promote
general social concern...


143
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.930
and less materialism
in young people.


144
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.760
Patrick,
how thought provoking.


145
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.130
Hello.

146
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.920
Hello.

147
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.650
Bleaching ? Are you
trying to say "bleaching" ?


148
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.650
Oh, my God.
Two things.


149
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.650
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.


150
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.660
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.


151
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.700
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.


152
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.330
Lady, if you don't shut your
fucking mouth, I will kill you.


153
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.960
Now, listen.

154
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.580
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.


155
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.580
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.


156
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.000
Listen, I can't understand you !
This is crazy ! You're a fool.


157
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.050
I can't cope with this
stupid "bitchee" !


158
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.630
Understand ?
Christ. Patrick ?


159
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.180
Hi, Patrick.

160
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.390
I thought that was you.
Hello. This is--


161
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.810
Isn't it ridiculous, coming all the way up here ?
They really are the best.


162
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.890
Then why can't they
get these stains out ?


163
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.400
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something ? I'm not getting anywhere.


164
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.400
- Oh, what are those ?
- Well, it's--


165
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.650
- Cranberry juice. Cranapple.
- Really ?


166
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.490
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.


167
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.660
I'm really late. I have a lunch
appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.


168
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.030
Hubert's ?
That moved uptown, right ? Oh, boy.


169
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.370
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.


170
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.410
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.


171
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.080
I'm downtown quite often. What about
a Saturday ? I'm at work all the time.


172
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.750
Next Saturday ?
Can't, I'm afraid. Sure.


173
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.000
At a matinee of LesMis.
Listen, I really gotta go.


174
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.880
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you. Okay. Do.


175
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.970
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.


176
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.970
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.


177
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.890
What could you possibly
be up to tonight ?


178
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.810
Stop it. I'm--
On a lot of lithium ?


179
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.190
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.


180
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.860
Pumpkin ? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.


181
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.730
Mm-hmm. Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.


182
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.950
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.


183
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.120
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay ?


184
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.580
I have to go.
Courtney ?


185
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.580
Hmm ?
Dinner.


186
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.210
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.


187
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.630
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.


188
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.710
Oh,yeah !

189
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.970
Dorsia.

190
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.230
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,


191
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.940
but is it possible to reserve a
table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps ?


192
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.580
...a facialat Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.


193
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.880
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,


194
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.300
where I got this little...

195
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.760
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car ?


196
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.840
God, Patrick.
Shut up.


197
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.680
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.


198
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.640
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.


199
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.430
I just want a child.

200
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.100
Just two...

201
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.730
perfect...

202
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.150
children.

203
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.860
Are we here ?
Yeah.


204
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.830
This is Dorsia ?
Yes, dear.


205
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.620
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...


206
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.290
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.


207
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.260
New York Matinee called it
"a playful but mysterious little dish."


208
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.170
You'll love it. And then the red
snapper with violets and pine nuts.


209
00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.180
I think that'll
follow nicely.


210
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.050
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.


211
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.100
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.


212
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.020
Dorsia.
How impressive.


213
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.320
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there ?


214
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.650
Lucky, I guess.

215
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.700
That's a wonderful suit.

216
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.070
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Let me guess.


217
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
Mmm, Valentino Couture ?

218
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.330
Uh-huh.
Hmm.


219
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.500
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.


220
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:39.420
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.
How the hell are you ?


221
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.800
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.


222
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.470
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,


223
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.010
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.


224
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.060
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.


225
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.060
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,


226
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.350
although I have
a slightly better haircut.


227
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.770
- How's the Ransom account going, Marcus ?
- It's, uh, all right.


228
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.190
Really ? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.


229
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.940
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia ?


230
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.700
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.


231
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.860
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.


232
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.410
- Thankyou, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.


233
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.750
Call me.
How about Friday ?


234
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.250
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.


235
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.800
Greatsea urchin ceviche.

236
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.880
Dorsia on Friday night ?
How'd he swing that ?


237
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.970
I think he's lying.

238
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.770
- Is that a gram ?
- New card.


239
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.770
What do you think ?

240
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.440
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.


241
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.440
Look at that. Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.


242
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.440
Good coloring.
That's bone.


243
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.070
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.


244
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.610
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing. Look at this.


245
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.070
That is really nice.

246
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.080
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think ?


247
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.000
Nice.

248
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.580
Jesus. That is really super.
How'da nitwit like you get so tasteful?


249
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.170
I can't believe that Bryce...

250
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.170
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.


251
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.130
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.


252
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:27.470
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.


253
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.100
Impressive.
Very nice.


254
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.230
Hmm.

255
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.520
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

256
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.950
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.


257
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.910
The tasteful thickness of it.

258
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.210
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.


259
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.460
Is something wrong,
Patrick ?


260
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.510
You're sweating.

261
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.620
Hello. Pat Bateman.

262
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.700
You want some, uh, money ?

263
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.710
Some food ?

264
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.540
- Is this what you need ?
- I'm-I'm hungry.


265
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.540
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it ?


266
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.680
Why don't you get a job ?
If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job ?


267
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.720
I lost my job.

268
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.760
Why ? You drinking ?

269
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.560
Is that why you lost it ?
Insider trading ?


270
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.850
Just joking.

271
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.020
Listen, what's your name ?
Al.


272
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.070
Hmm ? Speak up.
Come on. Al.


273
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.360
Get a goddamn job, Al.

274
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.570
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.


275
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.200
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.


276
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.080
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind-- You're a kind man.


277
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.080
It's okay.
I can tell.


278
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.500
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do. You gotta help me.


279
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.540
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.


280
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.210
You know how bad you smell ?

281
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.380
You reek of shit.
Do you know that ?


282
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.800
Al.

283
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.890
I'm sorry.
It's just that--


284
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.890
I don't know.

285
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.520
I don't have anything
in common with you.


286
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.400
Oh. Oh, thankyou, mister.
Thankyou.


287
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.610
I'm cold out here.

288
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.610
You know what a fucking loser you are ?
What ?


289
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.930
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.


290
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.220
So fine,
so smooth.


291
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.280
I have all the characteristics
of a human being--


292
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.950
flesh, blood, skin, hair--

293
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.280
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,


294
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.780
except for greed and disgust.

295
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.500
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,


296
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.500
and I don't know why.

297
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.710
My nightly bloodlust
has overflowed into my days.


298
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.510
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.


299
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.800
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.


300
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.100
Hey, Mc Cloy,
what do you say ?


301
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.650
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.


302
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.990
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account ?
Ofcourse. Who else ?


303
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.030
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.


304
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.660
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.


305
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.990
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are. I'm not late.


306
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.160
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.


307
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.330
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says, "Merry Christmas, Patrick."


308
00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.880
What is it ?
It's a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn't it ?


309
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.380
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.


310
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.800
They make darling pets.
Don't you ?


311
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.180
Don't you ?

312
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.300
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.


313
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.600
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas ?


314
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.930
And don't say
breast implants again.


315
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.520
Allen. Marcus.
Merry Christmas.


316
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.690
How you been ? Workaholic, I suppose ?
Haven't seen you in a while.


317
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.860
Hey, Hamilton. We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.


318
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.200
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring--


319
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.160
Cecilla ?
Yes, Cecilla.


320
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.530
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

321
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.250
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.


322
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.330
Great party.
Thanks.


323
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.580
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus ?


324
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.290
Mistletoe alert.

325
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.140
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.


326
00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.890
No, l want to know, okay ?
I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo,


327
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:04.560
which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,


328
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.060
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.


329
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.610
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight, and a Corona.


330
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.400
Would you like to hear--
Double Absolut martini.


331
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.530
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials ?


332
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.030
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.


333
00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.120
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.


334
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.080
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula...


335
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.080
are outrageous here.

336
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.460
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child ofdivorce.


337
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.090
Give me a break.

338
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:41.430
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime Jell-O. We should've gone to Dorsia.


339
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.180
I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.


340
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.930
Is that Ivana Trump ?

341
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.900
Oh, geez, Patrick. I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking ?


342
00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.730
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana ?


343
00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.820
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account ?


344
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.490
How'd you get it ?
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,


345
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.910
but then I'd have to
kill you.


346
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.460
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane ?


347
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.760
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.


348
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.630
Where do you tan ?
Salon.


349
00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.970
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.


350
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.300
And, uh, Cecilla.

351
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.680
How is she ?
Where is she tonight ?


352
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.680
Cecilla's, uh--
Well, you know Cecilla.


353
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.440
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.


354
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.360
Evelyn ?
Great ass.


355
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.110
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman. What a dork.


356
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.320
Another martini, Paul ?

357
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.030
You like
Huey Lewis and the News ?


358
00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.290
Um, they're okay.

359
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.080
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.


360
00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:08.130
But when Sports
came out in '83,


361
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.210
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.


362
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.180
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,


363
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.930
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...


364
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.220
that really gives the songs
a big boost.


365
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.940
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,


366
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:39.700
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.


367
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.700
Hey, Halberstram ?
Yes, Allen ?


368
00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.660
Why are there copies of the Style
section all over the place ?


369
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.580
Do you-- Do you have a dog ?
A little chow or something ?


370
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.540
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat ?


371
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.880
Yes, it is.

372
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.510
In '87, Huey released this--

373
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.510
Fore, their most
accomplished album.


374
00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.260
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square."


375
00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.100
The song's so catchy, most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.


376
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.640
But they should,
because it's not just about...


377
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.600
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.


378
00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.900
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself. Hey, Paul !


379
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.440
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,


380
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.610
you fuckin' stupid bastard !

381
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.660
You fucking bastard !

382
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.510
He was completely naked
and standing up on the table.


383
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.050
He had no clothes on
what so ever, and he--


384
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.050
Patrick ?
Patrick.


385
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.720
Is that you ?

386
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.060
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.


387
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.230
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.


388
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.480
Where are you going ? We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.


389
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.320
Ooh.

390
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.780
Where did you get
that overnight bag ?


391
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.240
Jean
-Paul Gaultier.

392
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.420
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,


393
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.460
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...


394
00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.550
before disposing
of the body.


395
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.760
There is a moment
of sheer panic...


396
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.220
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...


397
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.970
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.


398
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.940
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,


399
00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.190
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.


400
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.070
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.


401
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.200
Where do I send the bastard ?

402
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.240
Dallas ?

403
00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.820
Paris ? Singapore ?

404
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.040
London ? I'll send
the asshole to London.


405
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.540
Hi. This is Paul.

406
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.710
I've been called away
to London for a few days.


407
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.050
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.


408
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.570
What is it ?

409
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.320
Patrick.
Yes, Jean ?


410
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.580
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you. Who ?


411
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.250
Detective Donald Kimball.

412
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.330
Tell him I'm at lunch.

413
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.880
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.


414
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.300
Send him in, I guess.

415
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.180
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.


416
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.100
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.


417
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.520
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...


418
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.030
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.


419
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.530
Yes, always tip the stylist

420
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.410
Listen,John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.


421
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:30.160
Just joking. No, don't tip
the owner of the salon.


422
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.160
Okay, John ? Right.

423
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.460
Got it.
Sorry about that.


424
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.130
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.


425
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.130
Was that anything important ?

426
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.260
Oh, that ?
Just mulling over business problems,


427
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.720
examining opportunities, exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.


428
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.970
Hi.

429
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.010
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.


430
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.310
Nice to meet you. Sorry to barge
in on you like this.


431
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.390
I know how busy
you guys can get.


432
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:05.150
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion ?


433
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.690
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...


434
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.820
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.


435
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.160
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.


436
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.330
So it's nothing
that official.


437
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.580
- I just have some questions about
Paul Allen and yourself. - Coffee ?


438
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.790
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris ?


439
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.790
No, I'm okay.

440
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.420
Can you bring Mr.--

441
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.170
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris.


442
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.340
It's no problem.

443
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.140
So, what's the topic
of discussion ?


444
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.930
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.


445
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:43.640
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't--


446
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.350
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.


447
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.610
Not on page six, at least.

448
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:54.360
- I think his family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime ?


449
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.450
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure ? I can always get you a lime.


450
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.530
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay ?


451
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.580
Shoot.

452
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.120
Hold old are you ?
Twenty-seven.


453
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.120
Where did you go to school ?
Harvard.


454
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.830
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address ?


455
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.130
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.


456
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.710
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.


457
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.510
What can you tell me about Paul Allen ?
I'm at a loss.


458
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.470
He was part of that whole Yale thing.
"Yale thing" ?


459
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.390
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean, "Yale thing" ?


460
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:30.390
Well, I think for one that he was probably
a closet homosexual...


461
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.430
who did a lot of cocaine.

462
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.560
That "Yale thing."

463
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.860
What kind of man was he, besides
the information you've just given ?


464
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.730
- I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
- You feel like that ?


465
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.900
No, not really.

466
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:47.820
Where did Paul hang out ?

467
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:49.820
Hang out ?
Yeah, you know, hang out.


468
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:54.080
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,


469
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.120
Fluties, Indochine,

470
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.120
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

471
00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.580
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht ?


472
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.590
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he go to school ?


473
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.170
Don't you know this ?

474
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.220
I just wanted to know
if you know.


475
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.390
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.


476
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.430
Listen, I just--
I just wanna help.


477
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.520
I understand.

478
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.940
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints ?


479
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.110
Well, there's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.


480
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.740
- Well, maybe he did, huh ?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.


481
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.950
- But has anyone seen him in London ?
- Actually, yes.


482
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.280
Hmm. But I've had a hardtime
getting actual verification.


483
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.210
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.


484
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.210
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...


485
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.630
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so--


486
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.960
- Had his apartment been burglarized ?
- No, actually, it hadn't.


487
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.590
Toiletries were missing, a suit was
gone, so was some luggage. That's it.


488
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.090
I mean, no one's dealing with the
homicide squad yet or anything, right ?


489
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.640
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.


490
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.060
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.


491
00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.930
So typical, isn't it ?
It's just strange.


492
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.520
One day,
someone's walking around,


493
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.100
going to work, alive,
and then--


494
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.610
Nothing.

495
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.650
People just disappear.

496
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:18.400
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.


497
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.780
Eerie.
Really eerie.


498
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.580
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.


499
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.920
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.


500
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.960
The Four Seasons ?
Isn't that a little far uptown ?


501
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.420
I mean, aren't you gonna be late ?
No, there's one down here.


502
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.970
Oh, really ? I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.


503
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:49.180
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you, any information--


504
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.930
Absolutely. I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.


505
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.640
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.


506
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.520
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.


507
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.250
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.


508
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.710
- Would you like to see my apartment ?
- I'm not supposed to.


509
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.340
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not ?


510
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.930
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.


511
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.590
Do you take a credit card ?

512
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.260
I'm joking.

513
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.310
Come on. Get in.

514
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.900
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.


515
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:43.410
Blonde, who does couples.
Couples.


516
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:47.870
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.


517
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.620
I'm Paul.

518
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.920
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that ?


519
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.920
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.


520
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.920
Is that clear ?

521
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.970
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.


522
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.810
I want you
to clean your vagina.


523
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.990
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.


524
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.860
You have a very nice body.

525
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.460
Mm-hmm ?

526
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.210
Thank you. Send her up.

527
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.010
Christie,
get out and dry off.


528
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.970
Choose a robe--
not the Bijan--


529
00:39:56.050 --> 00:40:00.510
and come and meet me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.


530
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.440
You've arrived.
How lovely.


531
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.440
Let me take your coat.

532
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.280
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.


533
00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.030
Not quite blonde,
are you ?


534
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.030
More dirty blonde.

535
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.580
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.


536
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.750
I'm Paul Allen.

537
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.060
So.

538
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.060
Don't you wanna know
what I do ?


539
00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.020
No.
No, not really.


540
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.780
Well, I work on Wall Street...

541
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.110
for Pierce & Pierce.

542
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.280
Have you heard of it ?

543
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.170
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.


544
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.210
How much
did you pay for it ?


545
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.340
Well, actually,

546
00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.260
that's none of your business,
Christie.


547
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.090
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.


548
00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.430
No. No smoking.
Not in here.


549
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.970
Varda truffle ?

550
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.770
I don't want you to get drunk,

551
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.190
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.


552
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.280
Do you like Phil Collins ?

553
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.580
I've been a big Genesis fan
eversince the release...


554
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.660
of their 1980 album Duke.

555
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:06.460
Before that, I really didn't
understand any of their work.


556
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.590
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.


557
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.380
It was on Duke where...

558
00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.380
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.


559
00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:22.970
I think Invisible Touch is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.


560
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.480
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.


561
00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.230
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...


562
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.700
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.


563
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.780
Christie,
take off the robe.


564
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.910
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...


565
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.620
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.


566
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.040
You can practically hear
every nuance of every instrument.


567
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.040
Sabrina, remove your dress.

568
00:42:56.750 --> 00:43:00.210
ln terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,


569
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.300
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.


570
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.800
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.


571
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.810
Take the lyrics to
"Land of Confusion."


572
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.020
In this song,
Phil Collins...


573
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:16.150
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.


574
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:21.940
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...


575
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.320
about monogamy and commitment.

576
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.700
The song is
extremely uplifting.


577
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.160
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...


578
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.500
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.


579
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.170
Christie,
get down on your knees...


580
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.300
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

581
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.050
Phil Collins' solo career...

582
00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.970
seems to be more commercial,

583
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.180
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,


584
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.810
especially songs like "In the
Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds."


585
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.730
Sabrina, don't just stare at it.
Eat it.


586
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.770
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...


587
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.820
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.


588
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.280
And I stress the word "artist."

589
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.200
This is "Sussudio."

590
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.290
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.


591
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:40.800
Look at the camera.

592
00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.790
Christie, look at the camera.

593
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.980
Don't touch the watch.

594
00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.120
Can we go now ?

595
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.120
We're not through yet.

596
00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.520
If they have a good personality and they
are not great looking, then who fucking cares ?


597
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.520
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay ?


598
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.850
What if they have
a good personality ?


599
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.020
I know.
I know.


600
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.690
There are no girls
with good personalities.


601
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.610
A good personality consists
of a chick with a little hard body...


602
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.610
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...


603
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.620
without being too slutty
about things...


604
00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.620
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.


605
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.660
The only girls
with good personalities...


606
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.960
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent or talented--


607
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.870
though God knows what the fuck that means--
are ugly chicks.


608
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.250
Absolutely. And this is because
they have to make up...


609
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.130
for how fucking
unattractive they are.


610
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.420
- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women ?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar ?


611
00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:02.470
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say ?


612
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.640
"When I see a pretty girl walking
down the street, I think two things.


613
00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.140
"One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,


614
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.680
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."


615
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.190
- And what did the other part
of him think ?


616
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.850
What her head would look like
on a stick.


617
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.950
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion on something.


618
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.700
It's my business card.

619
00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:31.160
I decided to get
a new one too.


620
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.620
Oh, it's--

621
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:36.620
Very nice, Luis.

622
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.080
Thank you.

623
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.060
Listen, what about dinner ?

624
00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.930
Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten ? "What about fucking dinner" ?


625
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.060
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter ?
No shiatsu this morning ?


626
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.400
Keep touching me like that, you'll draw
back a stump. Hold on there, little buddy.


627
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.400
Excuse me.

628
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.730
God. Patrick.
Why here ?


629
00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.440
I've seen you
looking at me.


630
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.730
I've noticed your...

631
00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.440
hot body.

632
00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:58.530
Don't be shy.

633
00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:00.780
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this--


634
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.490
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.


635
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.830
You know, the one you were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.


636
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.290
I want you.
I want you too.


637
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.290
Patrick.
What is it ?


638
00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.460
Where are you going ?

639
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.340
I've gotta return
some video tapes.


640
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.890
Patrick !

641
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.370
Okay, London the--

642
00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.290
London, there's, um, a reservation--
Any Paul Allen ?


643
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.750
No. A reservation, but--
Kimball !


644
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.960
I've been wanting to talk with you.
Come into my office.


645
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.960
Jean, greatjacket.
Matsuta ?


646
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.010
Do you remember where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,


647
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.010
which was on
the 20th of December ?


648
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.100
God.

649
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.270
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.


650
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.690
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.


651
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.230
That's not what I've got.
What ?


652
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.690
That's not the information
I've received.


653
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.070
Well, I-
- Wait.

654
00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:35.110
- What information have you received ?
- Let me see.


655
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.030
Well--

656
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:40.030
You were with--
Well, I could be wrong.


657
00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.700
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen ?


658
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.040
We'd gone to a new musical...

659
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.670
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.


660
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.840
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.


661
00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.300
I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Peto--
No, Orso's.


662
00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.640
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.


663
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.680
I'm a little spent now too.

664
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.890
But how about lunch
in a week or so...


665
00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:07.220
when I've sorted out
all this information ?


666
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.230
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.


667
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.520
And if you could try and pin down
where you were...


668
00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.230
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.


669
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:18.570
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.


670
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.110
Huey Lewis and the News.

671
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:30.080
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it ?


672
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:35.170
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.


673
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:38.750
Not a big music fan, huh ?
No, I like music.


674
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:43.510
Just they're--
Huey's too black sounding for me.


675
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:45.630
To each his own.

676
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.930
So, lunch next week ?

677
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:51.930
I'll be there.

678
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.020
Oh !

679
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.110
Oh !

680
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:31.170
Will you call me before Easter ?
Maybe.


681
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.800
What are you doing tonight ?

682
00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:39.680
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

683
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:43.060
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.


684
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.810
I never knew you smoked.

685
00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.820
You never noticed.

686
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.360
Listen, Patrick.

687
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.280
Can we talk ?

688
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.700
You look... marvelous.

689
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.670
There's nothing to say.

690
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.290
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special ?


691
00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.760
Patrick ?

692
00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.220
Yes, Courtney ?

693
00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:28.560
If I don't see you
before Easter,


694
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.730
have a nice one, okay ?

695
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.690
You too.

696
00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.990
Patrick ?

697
00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:47.990
Yeah ?

698
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.910
Nothing.

699
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.940
There is this theory now--
Listen to me.


700
00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.940
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AlDS virus...


701
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.440
by having sex with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.


702
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.820
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,


703
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.610
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.


704
00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.410
I'm not sure, but I don't think
dyslexia is a virus.


705
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.870
But who knows ?
They don't know that.


706
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:40.870
Prove it.

707
00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.380
Oh, God.
What ?


708
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:57.890
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,


709
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:00.260
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,


710
00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:02.470
but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it, we'll be okay.


711
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.020
Can you keep it down ?
I'm trying to do drugs.


712
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.440
Fuck you ! Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.


713
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.480
That's right.

714
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.520
That is if the faggot in the next
stall thinks it's okay !


715
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.530
Fuck you !
Hey, fuck you !


716
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:19.360
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

717
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.820
Okay, let's do it.

718
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.510
Where did Craig go ?

719
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:48.010
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty...


720
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.020
between the United States
and Russia.


721
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.850
He's the one behind Glasnost.

722
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:56.400
- He said he was in mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you ?


723
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.520
No, not really.

724
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.440
Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.


725
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.190
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.


726
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.200
Ask me a question.

727
00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.530
So, what do you do ?

728
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:13.040
I'm into, uh, well, murders
and executions, mostly.


729
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.960
- Do you like it ?
- Well, it depends. Why ?


730
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.290
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers
and acquisitions really don't like it.


731
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:28.300
So, where do you work out ?

732
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:33.510
You think I'm dumb,
don't you ?


733
00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:36.680
What ? You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.


734
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.600
No.
I really don't.


735
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.440
That's okay.
I don't mind.


736
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.440
There's something sweet
about you.


737
00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.880
Doin' the crossword ?

738
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:20.180
You need any help ?

739
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:33.060
-Jean ?
- Yes, Patrick ?


740
00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:36.440
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner ?


741
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.400
That is,
if you're not doing anything.


742
00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.240
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.


743
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:46.450
Well,

744
00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.700
isn't this a coincidence ?

745
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.080
Listen, where should we go ?
Anywhere you want.


746
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.130
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want ?


747
00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.710
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.


748
00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.510
Come on.
Where do you wanna go ?


749
00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:09.430
Anywhere you want, just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.


750
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.430
What about...

751
00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.520
Dorsia ?

752
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:30.280
So,

753
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.870
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.


754
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:36.580
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.


755
00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.580
Dorsia is fine.

756
00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.880
Dorsia. Yes ?

757
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.130
Yeah, can you take two tonight at,
oh, let's say 9:00 ? We're totally booked.


758
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.130
Really ? That's great.

759
00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:56.720
No, I said we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00 ? Perfect.


760
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.810
See ya then.

761
00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.850
Yeah ?

762
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:07.360
You're... dressed okay.

763
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:11.650
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.


764
00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.450
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...


765
00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:18.910
for drinks.

766
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:20.910
And Jean,

767
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.990
you'll wanna change
before we go out.


768
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.500
Patrick, it's so elegant.

769
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.590
What a wonderful view.

770
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:38.090
Jean,

771
00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:40.090
sorbet ?

772
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.010
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.


773
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:53.850
Do you want a bite ?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.


774
00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:57.400
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right ?


775
00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.530
You look great.
Very fit.


776
01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.950
You can always be thinner,
look better.


777
01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:08.490
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.
I don't wanna ruin your will power.


778
01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.330
No, it's all right.

779
01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:14.830
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.


780
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.420
So listen.

781
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.550
What do you really
wanna do with your life ?


782
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.880
Just briefly, summarize.

783
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.800
And don't tell me you enjoy working
with children, okay ?


784
01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.260
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,


785
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.270
but I don't really know.

786
01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:39.730
I'm at a point in my life where
there seems to be so many possibilities,


787
01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:43.310
but I'm-- I don't know--
I'm just so unsure.


788
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.490
Do you have a boyfriend ?

789
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:53.320
No, not really.
Interesting.


790
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:57.030
Are you seeing anyone ?
I mean, seriously ?


791
01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.450
Maybe.

792
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.670
I don't know.
Not really.


793
01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.710
Jean,

794
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.460
do you feel... fulfilled ?

795
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:13.170
I mean, in your life ?

796
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.220
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.


797
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:21.390
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself, you know,


798
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.980
developing and growing.

799
01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.270
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.


800
01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.940
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,


801
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.190
a collie,
was named Lassie ?


802
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.700
Had you heard this ?
Who's Ted Bundy ?


803
01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.990
Forget it.

804
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.700
What's that ?

805
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:52.750
Duct tape. I need it for, uh,
taping something.


806
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.510
Patrick,

807
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.380
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy ?


808
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:05.850
What ? No !
Put it in the carton.


809
01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.560
Sorry.

810
01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.350
Jean ?

811
01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:18.900
What ?
Uh, make someone happy ?


812
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:22.610
Have you ever wanted to ?

813
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.450
I'm looking for, uh,

814
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.540
I guess you could say I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...


815
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.460
with someone special.
Hmm.


816
01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:49.470
Patrick ? Patrick ?
I know you're there.


817
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:51.760
Pick up the phone,
you badboy.


818
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.930
What are you up to tonight ?
It's me. Don't try to hide.


819
01:02:55.970 --> 01:03:00.180
I hope you're not with some little number
you picked up because you're my Mr. Bateman.


820
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:02.900
My boy next door.

821
01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.400
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,


822
01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.980
and I'll leave a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,


823
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:10.440
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.


824
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.780
You know Me lania.
She went to Sweet Briar.


825
01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.110
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,


826
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160
so I'll call you
tomorrowmorning, honey.


827
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.620
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.


828
01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:25.160
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O. Bye-bye.


829
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.460
Was that Evelyn ?

830
01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.760
Are you still seeing her?

831
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:44.140
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.


832
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.480
Do you want me to go ?

833
01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.480
Yeah.

834
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.280
I don't think
I can control myself.


835
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:05.280
I know. I should go. I know I have
a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.


836
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:09.750
I mean,

837
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.750
do you want me to go ?

838
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:16.790
I think if you stay,

839
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.550
something bad will happen.

840
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.800
I think I might hurt you.

841
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.640
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you ?


842
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.010
No. No, I guess not.

843
01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:33.020
I don't wanna get bruised.

844
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:37.900
You're right.
I should go.


845
01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:48.490
Oh. Don't forget you have a lunch date
tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.


846
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:51.910
Thanks.

847
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:54.280
It slipped my mind completely.

848
01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.350
So, the night
he disappeared--


849
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:20.180
any new thoughts
about what you did ?


850
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.600
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...


851
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:27.610
and some sorbet ?

852
01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.730
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.


853
01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.730
But how ?

854
01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:34.860
Where do you place...
Paul that night ?


855
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:38.450
According to his date book, and
this was verified by his secretary,


856
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:41.450
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.


857
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.740
And ?
I questioned him.


858
01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:48.080
- Marcus ? - Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.


859
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.080
But he denied it.
Yes.


860
01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.380
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi ?


861
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.920
Yes.
He does ? You'resure ?


862
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:59.930
I checked it out.
It's clean.


863
01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:07.470
Now, where were you ?

864
01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.640
Where was Marcus ?

865
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.890
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

866
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.110
Who was he with ?
He was...


867
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:16.650
at Atlantis... with...

868
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:20.780
Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...


869
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.400
and... you.

870
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.540
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.


871
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:33.790
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,


872
01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:36.040
but he had made plans.

873
01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.090
And I guess I had dinner with
Victoria the following night.


874
01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:42.550
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.


875
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:47.510
Split town for a while. Maybe he did go
to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.


876
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:51.800
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn
up sooner or later. I mean, to think...


877
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:57.140
that one of his friends killed him for no
reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.


878
01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.480
Isn't that right, Patrick ?

879
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.790
Christie. Christie.

880
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:26.630
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.


881
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.460
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.


882
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:32.340
I don't think so.

883
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.680
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.


884
01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.680
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.


885
01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:58.910
Nothing like last time.
Promise.


886
01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:00.910
All right.

887
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:04.280
So, you're looking great.
How have you been ?


888
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:08.210
Well, I actually might need surgery
after last time. Really ?


889
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:12.380
My friend told me I should maybe
even get a lawyer.


890
01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.130
Lawyers are so complicated.

891
01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.750
Don't do that.

892
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.760
Here's a check.

893
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:11.340
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.


894
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.100
Okay, your name is Christie.

895
01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:22.810
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.


896
01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:27.320
She'll bejoining us
in my new apartment shortly.


897
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.820
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.


898
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:40.540
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton ?


899
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:45.670
I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I ?
With Spicey ?


900
01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:48.960
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but
definitely at SurfBar. You know, SurfBar.


901
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.170
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.


902
01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:56.420
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.


903
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:59.050
This is nicer
than your other apartment.


904
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.350
Oh, it's not
that nice.


905
01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:11.690
Where did you two meet ?
Oh, God. We met at...


906
01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:16.190
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.


907
01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:19.570
You were hanging out with that
bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.


908
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.910
What do you mean ?
She was a hot number.


909
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:26.580
If you had a platinum card, she'd give you
a blowjob. This girl worked in a tanning salon.


910
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.200
What do you do ?

911
01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:33.210
She's my... cousin.

912
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:37.210
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.


913
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:40.630
Where's your phone ?
I've gotta call Harley.


914
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:47.800
Where do you summer,
South Hampton ?


915
01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:52.140
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.


916
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.230
It's 3:00 in the morning. He's a goddamn
drug dealer. These are his peak hours.


917
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:58.400
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I ?


918
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.400
This tastes weird.

919
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.730
Harley, it's me. I need your services.
Translate that howeveryou want.


920
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:08.570
- I'm at--
- Paul Allen's.


921
01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.950
Who ?
Paul Allen's.


922
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:14.950
I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at
Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.


923
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.790
And if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow
night I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.


924
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.790
Did you know that guy
who disappeared ?


925
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:23.750
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce ?
Was he a friend of yours ?


926
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.750
No.

927
01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.710
Do you have any coke ?
Or Halcyon ?


928
01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.800
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.


929
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:35.640
I would just like to see...

930
01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.220
the two of you...
get it on.


931
01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:41.480
What's wrong with that ?

932
01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.810
It's totally disease free.

933
01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:48.730
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.


934
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:51.110
Don't you find Christie
attractive ?


935
01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:54.950
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.


936
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:57.320
Come on.

937
01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:00.830
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time ?


938
01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.290
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.


939
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.210
Are you telling me you've never
gotten it on with a girl?


940
01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:13.420
No. I'm not a lesbian.

941
01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.340
Why would you think
I would be into that ?


942
01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.590
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.


943
01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:23.260
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.


944
01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:29.810
Did you know...

945
01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:33.350
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...


946
01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.440
called simply
Whitney Houston...


947
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.320
had four number-one
singles on it ?


948
01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.900
Did you know that,
Christie ?


949
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:46.410
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston ?


950
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:49.280
You own
a Whitney Houston CD ?


951
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:53.870
More than one ?

952
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.420
It's hard to choose a favorite among
so many great tracks.


953
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:04.300
But the "Greatest Love Of All"
is one of the best, most powerful songs...


954
01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.510
ever written...

955
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:08.510
about self-preservation...

956
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:10.800
and dignity.

957
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:14.470
It's universal message
crosses all boundaries...


958
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.730
and instills one...

959
01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:20.440
with the hope
that it's not too late...


960
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.860
to better ourselves.

961
01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.280
Since, Elizabeth,

962
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.320
it's impossible in this world we
live in to empathize with others,


963
01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.950
we can always empathize
with ourselves.


964
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:39.330
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.


965
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.130
And it's beautifully stated
on the album.


966
01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.440
- Not the face !

967
01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.570
You bitch, not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash !


968
01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.860
I want a firm commitment.

969
01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:36.570
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.


970
01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:38.570
Why ? What's wrong ?

971
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.080
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...


972
01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.950
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,


973
01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.040
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.


974
01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.460
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick ?


975
01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:56.540
It's over, Evelyn.

976
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:59.130
It's all over.

977
01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:02.510
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.


978
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:06.050
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right ? Now, are we having coffee ?


979
01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.970
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.


980
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.930
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.


981
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:19.270
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.


982
01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.650
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something--


983
01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:28.070
I know that your friends are my friends,
and, uh-- and I've thought about that.


984
01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:31.200
You can have 'em.

985
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.740
You're really serious,
aren't you ? Yes, lam.


986
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:42.080
- What about the past ? Our past ?
- We never really shared one.


987
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:44.210
You're inhuman.
No.


988
01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:47.420
I'm in touch with humanity.

989
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:51.930
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh--


990
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:54.050
You're not terribly
important to me.


991
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.810
Oh, no !

992
01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:59.140
No. No, Patrick.

993
01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:03.770
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.


994
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:08.230
What do you want me to do ?
What is it that you want ?


995
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:11.650
If you really wanna do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.


996
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.650
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

997
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:17.240
I'm leaving. I've assessed the
situation, and I'm going.


998
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.620
Where are you going ?
I'm just leaving.


999
01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.830
But where ?

1000
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:26.160
I have to return
some videotapes.


1001
01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:58.820
Here, kitty, kitty.

1002
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.250
Oh, my God.
What are you doing ?


1003
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:19.340
Stop that.

1004
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.500
Drop the weapon !
Drop it now !


1005
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.580
Get on the ground!
Put your--


1006
01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:51.130
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith ?


1007
01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:53.590
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.


1008
01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.790
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.


1009
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:28.880
You're my lawyer, so I think you should
know I've killed a lot of people.


1010
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.750
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,


1011
01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.050
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,


1012
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:37.510
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.


1013
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:39.850
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.


1014
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:43.100
I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.


1015
01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:47.640
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot with a dog.


1016
01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:49.900
Last week, I, uh--

1017
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:53.480
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.


1018
01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.530
I had to.
She almost got away.


1019
01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:01.530
And--

1020
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:06.740
Someone else there. I can't remember,
maybe a model-- She's dead too.


1021
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:09.370
And, uh, Paul Allen.

1022
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:13.290
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.


1023
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:17.800
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.


1024
01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:22.510
I don't wanna leave anything out here.
I guess I've killed maybe... 20 people.


1025
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:25.680
Maybe 40 !

1026
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.100
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1027
01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.810
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.


1028
01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:34.560
I even, um,

1029
01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:44.110
I ate some
of their brains...


1030
01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:47.950
and I tried to
cook a little.


1031
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.530
Tonight, I, uh--

1032
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:57.580
I just had to kill
a lot of people !


1033
01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.790
And, um,

1034
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:07.960
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.


1035
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.840
So, uh-
- I mean,

1036
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:17.390
I guess...

1037
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:20.100
I'm a pretty, uh--

1038
01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:24.190
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.


1039
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:26.860
So,

1040
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.360
if you get back tomorrow,

1041
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.700
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1042
01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.860
So, you know,

1043
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:39.160
keep your eyes open.

1044
01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.330
Okay.

1045
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:48.290
Oh !

1046
01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:00.870
Are you my 2:00 ?

1047
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:04.870
No.
Can I help you ?


1048
01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.120
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.


1049
01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:15.050
Doesn't he... live here ?
No, he doesn't.


1050
01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:18.050
You sure ?

1051
01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:20.470
You saw the ad
in the Times ?


1052
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:23.510
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.


1053
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:27.140
ln the Times. There was no ad
in the Times.


1054
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:30.680
I think you should
go now.


1055
01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:32.690
But I think--

1056
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:36.520
I wanna know
what happened here.


1057
01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:39.860
Don't make any trouble,
please.


1058
01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:42.190
I suggest you go.

1059
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.910
Don't come back.

1060
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.170
I won't.

1061
01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:00.340
Don't worry.

1062
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:31.530
Patrick Bateman's office.

1063
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:35.320
Jean ? I need help.
Patrick, is that you ?


1064
01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:38.950
Jean, I'm not--

1065
01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:43.540
Craig McDermott called. Wants to meet you,
David Van Patten and Tim Bryce at Harry's.


1066
01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:47.500
Oh, God. What did you say,
you dumb bitch ?


1067
01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:51.460
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing ?


1068
01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:53.510
Where are you, Patrick ?
What's wrong ?


1069
01:28:55.630 --> 01:29:00.350
I don't think I'm gonna make it,Jean,
to the, uh,


1070
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:02.350
office this afternoon.

1071
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:04.350
Why ?

1072
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:09.150
Just say no ! What is it, Patrick ?
Are you all right ?


1073
01:29:09.230 --> 01:29:13.400
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.


1074
01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.400
Jesus !

1075
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:37.060
That's a table for three. Bateman,
you're looking wild-eyed. Rough day ?


1076
01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:40.060
Hey, look. Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.


1077
01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:43.230
He's a changed man, except for he still
can't a reservation to save his life.


1078
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:45.480
Why don't you just try

1079
01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:49.070
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.


1080
01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:52.950
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, OysterBar.
Come on, faggots. Let's get a "res."


1081
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:56.780
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.


1082
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:58.870
Need a reservation
for 8:30.


1083
01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:01.490
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.


1084
01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:04.000
10:00 would not be
any good. No.


1085
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.420
Just fucking call them. Give me the phone.
I'll do it. I'll call you back.


1086
01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.880
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.


1087
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.920
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.


1088
01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:19.050
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message ?


1089
01:31:19.130 --> 01:31:23.350
Jesus, yes. That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it ?


1090
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:27.180
Yeah, naturally. Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.


1091
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:29.190
That's fabulous. That's rich.
What exactly do you mean ?


1092
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:33.690
The message you left. By the way, Davis,
how's Cynthia ? You're still seeing her, right ?


1093
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:35.860
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean ?


1094
01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:39.530
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.


1095
01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:42.150
Is that Edward Towers ?

1096
01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.160
Carnes, wait. Uh--

1097
01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:50.000
Davis, I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.


1098
01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:54.000
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:


1099
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.170
Bateman is such a dork.

1100
01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:59.880
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.


1101
01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.800
Now, if you said Bryce or Mc Dermott.
Otherwise, it was amusing.


1102
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.470
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.


1103
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:10.050
Wait. Uh-
- Stop.

1104
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:13.930
I did it, Carnes.

1105
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:15.980
I killed him.

1106
01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.600
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1107
01:32:21.810 --> 01:32:24.070
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.


1108
01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:30.320
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.


1109
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:33.240
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.


1110
01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:36.490
No. No, listen.

1111
01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:39.080
Don't you know who I am ?

1112
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.920
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.


1113
01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:47.880
We talk on the phone
all the time.


1114
01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.550
Don't you recognize me ?

1115
01:32:51.930 --> 01:32:54.760
You're my lawyer.

1116
01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:59.430
Now, Carnes, listen.

1117
01:32:59.510 --> 01:33:01.770
Listen very, very carefully.

1118
01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.810
I killed Paul Allen,

1119
01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.900
and I liked it.

1120
01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:14.780
I can't make myself
any clearer.


1121
01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:18.950
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny anymore.


1122
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:22.580
It never was supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible ?


1123
01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:26.910
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard ?


1124
01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.250
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...


1125
01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:31.880
twice in London
just ten days ago.


1126
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.040
No, you...

1127
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.630
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.


1128
01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.170
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...


1129
01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:26.760
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.


1130
01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.300
We need to find a way to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...


1131
01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.760
can't be run
by committee.


1132
01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:36.310
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...


1133
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:40.310
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.


1134
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:44.320
And in the end, this maybe the eventual
blessing in disguise...


1135
01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.400
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.


1136
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.110
How can he lie like that ?

1137
01:34:50.190 --> 01:34:52.160
How can he pull that shit ?
What shit ?


1138
01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.320
Now, where do we have
reservations at ?


1139
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:57.370
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.


1140
01:34:57.450 --> 01:35:00.370
How can you be so fucking,

1141
01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:02.960
I don't know,
cool about it ?


1142
01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.500
Some guys arejust
born cool, I guess.


1143
01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:13.380
Bateman ?

1144
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:18.720
- What are you so fucking zany about ?
- I'm just a happy camper.


1145
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.260
Rockin' and a rollin' !

1146
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:23.390
Oh, brother, look.

1147
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:28.520
He presents himself as this harmless
old codger, but inside--


1148
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:31.190
but inside--

1149
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:34.190
But inside doesn't matter.

1150
01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:38.570
Inside ? Believe or not, Bryce,
we're actually listening to you.


1151
01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:41.240
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think ?


1152
01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:48.450
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers ?


1153
01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.540
I need a scotch.

1154
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.760
There are no more barriers
to cross.


1155
01:36:09.850 --> 01:36:13.690
All I have in common with the
uncontrollable and the insane,


1156
01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:17.110
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...


1157
01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:19.230
and my utter indifference
toward it,


1158
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:21.900
I have now surpassed.

1159
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:27.490
My pain is constant and sharp...

1160
01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:31.200
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.


1161
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.790
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.


1162
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:38.460
I want no one to escape.

1163
01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:42.460
But even after admitting this,

1164
01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.710
there is no catharsis.

1165
01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.550
My punishment continues
to elude me...


1166
01:36:47.630 --> 01:36:50.840
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.


1167
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.680
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.


1168
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:58.930
This confession
has meant... nothing.


1169
01:36:59.410 --> 01:37:02.540
