Hi, I'm Evie Kenneth.

Hi, I'm Hart Kenneth.

3
00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:41.615
I'm a writer.

4
00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.017
I'm a photographer.

5
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.485
And we want to believe you.

Evie and Hart Kenneth,

9
00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:54.996
distraught over the tragic loss

10
00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.563
of their daughter...

11
00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:58.666
...were driven
towards the paranormal.


12
00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.101
Grief-stricken,

13
00:03:00.134 --> 00:03:01.869
they use their art

14
00:03:01.903 --> 00:03:04.471
to find lost souls,

15
00:03:04.504 --> 00:03:07.675
hoping to, one day,
speak to their daughter.

There's another five minutes.

No, turn it off!

Okay.

21
00:03:14.414 --> 00:03:17.084
Fine, Betsy, if you could.

22
00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:18.886
Uh, okay, just did.

23
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.088
Is that really
how you see me?


24
00:03:21.122 --> 00:03:22.657
That's how it sells.

25
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.759
-Answer the damn question!
-Arn, Arn, Arn,


26
00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:27.561
what my wife is trying
to tell you is


27
00:03:27.594 --> 00:03:29.063
we hate everything
about this.


28
00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:32.633
Look, guys, how do you
want me to sell you?


29
00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:35.468
I mean, look, neither of you
have worked in five years,


30
00:03:35.502 --> 00:03:37.071
except for these
ghost stories,


31
00:03:37.104 --> 00:03:40.407
and they sell because...
dead daughter.


32
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.809
That's not why I got into this!

33
00:03:41.843 --> 00:03:43.010
And that's not how I
got the job.


34
00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:43.978
You gave me the job.

35
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:45.947
Uh, excuse me, sweetie,

36
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.415
can you give us a minute?

37
00:03:48.448 --> 00:03:50.417
Betsy, you, too.

38
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.385
What?
Why?


39
00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.054
Please?

40
00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:55.522
Fine.
Here.


41
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.596
Bet she's a great writer.

42
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.397
She's a client, okay?

43
00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:06.801
You think I can make a living
off what you two bring in?


44
00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:08.903
-She single?
-Yeah.


45
00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:10.972
Mm-hmm, and you know
that because...?


46
00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:13.007
I'll, uh, see you two
at the signing.


47
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.476
Yeah, book signing
your therapist/agent


48
00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:17.645
made for you guys.

49
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:18.813
Yeah, see you there.

50
00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:24.852
So, what time's
the signing start?


51
00:04:24.886 --> 00:04:25.552
Forty-five minutes ago.

52
00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.021
Oh.

53
00:04:27.054 --> 00:04:28.455
Yeah let's not even talk
about it.


54
00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:29.724
Yeah, not good, not good.

55
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:35.730
Excuse me.

56
00:04:35.763 --> 00:04:37.865
Are you here for the signing,
for Evie and Hart Kenneth?


57
00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:38.933
-Um --
-Yeah, come here.


58
00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:40.835
Come right this way.
Yep.


59
00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:44.705
-Hi.
-Can you sign this?


60
00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:47.942
Oh, look, babe, this is
your first issue right here.


61
00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:50.211
I haven't seen this in awhile.
Yeah, here, I --


62
00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:51.679
Just you.
Just you.


63
00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:55.716
Sure.

64
00:04:57.018 --> 00:04:59.552
I'm going to step outside
with Arn.


65
00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:00.955
All you, Evie.

66
00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:02.489
Hey, if they're
not published,


67
00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:04.091
then they're going to be
a waste of my time.


68
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:04.926
I don't rep losers.

69
00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.695
Hey, my client's here.
I got to go.


70
00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:08.963
Is it over?

71
00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:10.698
Yeah.

72
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:12.033
Phenomenal turnout.

73
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:15.202
I'm sorry.
-Yeah. Let's go light one.


74
00:05:15.236 --> 00:05:16.804
-Yeah.
-Don't worry about it.


75
00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:19.974
-Okay, cool.
-So, who do I make this out to?


76
00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:22.243
Faith.

77
00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:24.245
I know, it was
your daughter's name.


78
00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:26.047
Excuse me?

79
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.617
I really wanted you
to sign this one.


80
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:33.486
Okay.

81
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.623
Haven't seen this one
for a while.


82
00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:37.625
I love it.

83
00:05:37.658 --> 00:05:39.193
The woman so strong.

84
00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:41.062
Why'd you delete
your blog?!


85
00:05:41.095 --> 00:05:43.230
Because I was giving away
too much personal information.


86
00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:47.702
Like my daughter's name?

87
00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:49.036
It's not your fault.

88
00:05:58.713 --> 00:06:00.247
I am never doing that again.

89
00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:05.186
- Hey.

90
00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.588
How's your new
stalker friend?


91
00:06:08.622 --> 00:06:10.758
Let me -- Let me go check
this out real quick.


92
00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:14.161
Hey.

93
00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:16.030
What's up?
You alright?


94
00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:17.031
Can we go?

95
00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:18.265
Let's just go!

96
00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:20.234
Alright, cool.

97
00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:30.011
What's going on?

98
00:06:30.044 --> 00:06:31.645
-Hey! Got another job
for you guys...
-Yo.


99
00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:33.314
-...if you want it. Huh?
-Let's do it.


100
00:06:33.347 --> 00:06:35.282
-Send it to my phone.
-Yeah, already did.


101
00:06:35.316 --> 00:06:37.151
Hey, but you got
to travel tonight.


102
00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:39.920
-Why so soon?
-Well, lady thinks
she's going to die.


103
00:06:39.954 --> 00:06:42.790
Oh, hey, they play up
the melodrama,


104
00:06:42.823 --> 00:06:44.325
Arn, we just
jack up the prices.


105
00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:46.327
- Got her to pay double.
- My man!


106
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.729
It's, uh, her dad's estate
out in Big Bear.


107
00:06:48.763 --> 00:06:50.597
-Nice.
-That's three hours from here.


108
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:52.733
Arn!
We will take it.


109
00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.770
Okay. After this, we can
publish Volume 8, okay?


110
00:06:55.803 --> 00:06:57.570
You guys call me, once
you're settled, alright?


111
00:06:57.604 --> 00:06:59.673
-Hey, throw it back
in here again. Hey!
-Yeah.


112
00:06:59.707 --> 00:07:01.008
Let's go, baby.

113
00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:03.244
Let's go!

114
00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.080
What is wrong?

115
00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:10.051
What'd she say to you?

116
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.756
She knew her name.

117
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.226
She was like,
"My name's Faith,


118
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.362
just like your daughter's."

119
00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:23.097
Oh, fuck.

120
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.002
You want to know what else
she told me?


121
00:07:31.005 --> 00:07:31.906
What's that, Evie?

122
00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:36.310
She said,
"It's not your fault."


123
00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:39.013
What's not your fault?

124
00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:40.147
Failing as a mother.

125
00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:44.752
Evie, no one thinks that.
Come on.


126
00:07:47.188 --> 00:07:49.023
Alright, you got
a good balance going.


127
00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:50.791
You with me? Right here.
Put it here.


128
00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:52.726
Oh, too slow.
Love you.


129
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.695
Huh? Yeah?
-I'm going to get you.


130
00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:56.130
Oh,
you're going to get me?


131
00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:57.631
That was good!

132
00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:58.332
Look at that!

133
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.094
How are the reviews?

134
00:08:27.128 --> 00:08:28.429
"'Avalon Days'

135
00:08:28.462 --> 00:08:30.898

of romantic fiction


136
00:08:30.931 --> 00:08:32.166
since --"
-Stop.


137
00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:33.901
-Mom.
-Shh!


138
00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:34.969
Oh, who's that?

139
00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:36.137
That's my daughter,
Arn.


140
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.771
You have a daughter?

141
00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:39.874
Shut up, okay?
Are any of the reviews


142
00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:41.442
something we
can actually use?


143
00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:43.210
Use, how?
Your sales numbers, alone,


144
00:08:43.244 --> 00:08:45.679
can land a legitimate publisher
for the sequel,


145
00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:47.848
prequel, spinoffs.
-Mom.


146
00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:49.850
Look, there's a panel
this weekend in Houston


147
00:08:49.884 --> 00:08:51.685
I want to get you on.
-Mom!


148
00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:53.320
Faith,
Mom is on the phone!


149
00:08:53.354 --> 00:08:54.889
Hell, I'll look after her,
if that's what you're,


150
00:08:54.922 --> 00:08:56.757
you know, really kind of
trying to get at.


151
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.260
Faith!

152
00:08:59.293 --> 00:09:01.061
Faith?!
-Evie?


153
00:09:01.095 --> 00:09:02.830
Hey, what's going on?
-Faith! Faith!


154
00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:04.899
Help!
-How can I help?
What do you want --


155
00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:06.066
What do you want me to do?
-Help!


156
00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:12.706
Are you alright?

157
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.746
You know I can drive.

158
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.795
Hey, you just want to go
grab some food?


159
00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:40.434
Uh, was that a yes?

160
00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:41.468
I'm not hungry.

161
00:09:43.504 --> 00:09:45.506
That sucks.

162
00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:49.176
I thought maybe a nice meal
with my wife would be...


163
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.110
pretty good.

164
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.298
This traffic
is crazy, huh?


165
00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:14.868
We could've said no.

166
00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:17.938
We. It's a two-person
conversation.


167
00:10:19.573 --> 00:10:22.343
I got two points for you.
Let me start with point A.


168
00:10:22.376 --> 00:10:23.210
We?

169
00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:25.246
Need the money.

170
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.480
Now, B.

171
00:10:26.513 --> 00:10:27.881
Didn't we always say,

172
00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:28.849
before we started
this business,


173
00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:30.484
that we always wanted to

174
00:10:30.517 --> 00:10:32.920
create opportunities
where we could travel?


175
00:10:32.953 --> 00:10:36.190
We're doing it.
-It is our business.


176
00:10:36.223 --> 00:10:37.958
We are never splitting up
again, okay?


177
00:10:37.992 --> 00:10:40.294
We do all jobs together,
from this point on.


178
00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:42.129
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.


179
00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:43.464
If I remember correctly,

180
00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:45.199
that was actually
your brilliant idea.


181
00:10:45.232 --> 00:10:47.034
Yeah, but you're the one
that agreed with me.


182
00:10:47.067 --> 00:10:48.836
Of course I did!
You're my wife!


183
00:10:48.869 --> 00:10:51.038
I'm just trying to be
a loving husband


184
00:10:51.071 --> 00:10:52.873
and supportive and...

185
00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:55.075
simply just to please
my wife, there you go.


186
00:11:12.226 --> 00:11:13.527
Uh, hello?

187
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.830
Hey, is this Hart?

188
00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:18.832
Uh, who is this?

189
00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:20.234
Evie.
Uh --


190
00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:22.603
Evie Adams. We went
to college together.


191
00:11:22.637 --> 00:11:24.905
I'm a writer
, uh,


192
00:11:24.938 --> 00:11:27.174
and I'm, um, a mother
and I know this is going


193
00:11:27.207 --> 00:11:29.543
to sound kinda crazy.

194
00:11:29.576 --> 00:11:31.979
My daughter has
a rare blood disease.


195
00:11:32.012 --> 00:11:35.182
Maybe, um, when I get back
in town, we can connect


196
00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:37.084
and you can fill me in
on more details.


197
00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:39.987
Hey, I'll drive.

198
00:12:10.284 --> 00:12:13.921
♪ Big chips, Chris Casino,
nigga, you no duffel bag ♪


199
00:12:13.954 --> 00:12:15.255
♪ Yeah, I'm selling everything ♪

200
00:12:15.289 --> 00:12:18.158
♪ I ain't trying
to double back ♪


201
00:13:58.091 --> 00:13:59.694
Yeah, this look
like the address.


202
00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:02.229
Where is she?
-I don't know.


203
00:14:02.262 --> 00:14:04.598
You know,
she sent me an email.


204
00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:07.468
I'm just going to give her
a call.


205
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:10.471
We've been on the road
all night.


206
00:14:10.504 --> 00:14:11.639
Come on, now.

207
00:14:15.576 --> 00:14:18.212
Mm.

208
00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:19.313
She's not answering.

209
00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:20.214
Wow.

210
00:14:24.518 --> 00:14:26.420
Hey.

211
00:14:26.453 --> 00:14:27.354
We good?

212
00:14:31.492 --> 00:14:33.026
I know it's been
a long ride.


213
00:14:36.563 --> 00:14:40.367
We good?
-Yeah. I just let that


214
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.736
woman in the store
get to me.


215
00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:44.739
Nah, don't let her
throw you off, alright?


216
00:14:44.772 --> 00:14:47.174
And, look, hey, the moment
this job goes south,


217
00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:48.643
we can --
-It's not going
to go south, okay?


218
00:14:48.676 --> 00:14:50.477
Just have a little faith.

219
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:51.378
I can do that.

220
00:14:54.682 --> 00:14:56.116
How about that bar?

221
00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:58.285
How about this car?

222
00:14:58.318 --> 00:15:00.387
I'm not that desperate.

223
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.690
Wow!

224
00:15:02.724 --> 00:15:05.259
It's called spontaneity!

225
00:15:16.603 --> 00:15:17.471
Hey, Arn.

226
00:15:17.504 --> 00:15:18.640
She's not here.

227
00:15:18.673 --> 00:15:20.541
What?
Alright, um --


228
00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:21.542
Yeah, we've already
been sitting here


229
00:15:21.575 --> 00:15:23.811
for like five minutes.

230
00:15:23.845 --> 00:15:25.412
Are you sure this
isn't a joke?


231
00:15:25.445 --> 00:15:27.514
I mean, she wanted
to pay us a lot of money.


232
00:15:27.548 --> 00:15:29.616
I don't think that
this was something --


233
00:15:29.651 --> 00:15:31.084
You know,
that's not normal.


234
00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.288
We drove all the way here.
It's been four hours.


235
00:15:34.321 --> 00:15:35.522
We drove literally
for four hours


236
00:15:35.556 --> 00:15:36.691
and, if this is
some kind of prank,


237
00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:38.091
I'm going to expect you
to pay me


238
00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:39.293
what she was already
going to pay us.


239
00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:40.594
Give me a minute,
I'll call you back.


240
00:15:42.462 --> 00:15:43.597
Whatever.
Okay.


241
00:15:45.566 --> 00:15:46.233
What happened?

242
00:15:48.235 --> 00:15:49.236
Everything good?

243
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:50.738
Yeah.

244
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.207
Freezing.

245
00:15:56.376 --> 00:15:57.845
So...

246
00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.413
So.

247
00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:01.615
You buying?

248
00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:03.685
I'll take that --
I'll take Reserve.


249
00:16:03.718 --> 00:16:05.787
Whoo! Now, tequila,
I can't do that tequila.


250
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.722
-I do tequila.
That's all I can ever do.
-Thank you.


251
00:16:07.755 --> 00:16:10.123
I can't do anything more
than tequila.


252
00:16:10.157 --> 00:16:12.192
-Cheers!
-Nice to meet you.


253
00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:13.226
Cheers!

254
00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:17.832
Ah!

255
00:16:17.865 --> 00:16:19.333
There we go.

256
00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:21.134
Good stuff, huh?

257
00:16:21.168 --> 00:16:23.337
Uh, you know what?
One time with this, alright?


258
00:16:29.576 --> 00:16:31.144
-Hey, Arn.
-Hello, hey.


259
00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:33.513
She'll be at the house
in 30 minutes.


260
00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:34.749
Took some convincing.

261
00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:36.316
Okay, why is that?

262
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.652
Ah, she's having
second thoughts?


263
00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:39.419
I don't know.
-Yeah, you know what?


264
00:16:39.453 --> 00:16:40.888
I don't know.
-What does that mean?


265
00:16:40.922 --> 00:16:42.189
It means I'm tired.

266
00:16:42.222 --> 00:16:45.325
You need a foot rub?

267
00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:48.228
No, I mean I just finished
that Salinas job --


268
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:49.631
Yeah, now, you're
on another one.


269
00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:52.499
It's called being
successful, yeah.


270
00:16:52.532 --> 00:16:54.468
Thank you, Arn,
for believing in me
and scooping me


271
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:56.536
out of my deep,
dark depression.


272
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.604
I don't know, man.

273
00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:58.640
Her birthday's this Friday.

274
00:16:58.673 --> 00:17:00.742
Ugh!
Jesus Christ,


275
00:17:00.775 --> 00:17:01.909
would you just get
over it?


276
00:17:01.943 --> 00:17:03.343
Arn, you don't just forget

277
00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:04.779
about a child that died.

278
00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:06.179
Have another kid.

279
00:17:06.213 --> 00:17:07.815
Get a puppy.
Fuck it, I'll --


280
00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:09.717
I'll let you in
on a secret, okay?


281
00:17:09.751 --> 00:17:12.754
After Volume 8, this is
going international.


282
00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:15.790
Yeah.
Paris, Africa.


283
00:17:15.823 --> 00:17:17.725
I bet Hart would love
to go to Africa.


284
00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:20.193
-Shut up, you racist prick.
-I should've dropped you


285
00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:22.262
so many times,
but I believe in you.


286
00:17:22.295 --> 00:17:23.597
-Okay.
-Okay.


287
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:25.967
Hey, look,
this is the one, okay?


288
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.502
Volume 8.
They want to see
your sales spike


289
00:17:28.535 --> 00:17:30.303
like they did
after 6 and 7.


290
00:17:30.337 --> 00:17:32.439
Do that
and we're all happy.


291
00:17:32.472 --> 00:17:33.507
Okay, I get it.

292
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.942
Okay, great.
So we cool?


293
00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:36.209
I'm not the bad guy?

294
00:17:36.243 --> 00:17:37.611
No, you're still
the bad guy.


295
00:17:37.645 --> 00:17:39.981
You're definitely
a womanizing, racist prick.


296
00:17:40.014 --> 00:17:42.582
Ah, thank you.
Okay, so, great.


297
00:17:42.616 --> 00:17:44.518
So, get your fine ass
over to that house.


298
00:17:44.551 --> 00:17:45.687
The bitch is waiting.

299
00:17:47.554 --> 00:17:49.691
-Hey, everything good?
-Yeah, man.


300
00:17:49.724 --> 00:17:51.491
She's on her way
over there. We need to go.


301
00:17:51.525 --> 00:17:53.828
Oh, she's here now?
She decided to show up?
Alright.


302
00:17:53.861 --> 00:17:55.595
-Yeah, we need to go.
-Let me just finish this off.


303
00:17:56.931 --> 00:17:58.565
Let's bust some ghosts, hm?
-Okay.


304
00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:00.500
Alright? Let's get it.
Hey, appreciate y'all.


305
00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.410
Here we go.

306
00:18:10.444 --> 00:18:11.578
Be nice.

307
00:18:18.753 --> 00:18:19.821
Margaret.

308
00:18:19.854 --> 00:18:21.856
I am Evie Kenneth.

309
00:18:24.692 --> 00:18:27.327
Well, if you'll just give us
the key, we'll get started.


310
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.896
As I told Mr. Arnold
on the phone,


311
00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.331
I have no intention of letting
you stay here tonight.


312
00:18:31.364 --> 00:18:32.332
Then why are you here?

313
00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:33.600
I'm here to warn you.

314
00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:35.002
Warn us?

315
00:18:35.036 --> 00:18:36.738
-Warn me about what?
-Right?


316
00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:39.473
They spotted you the moment
you drove into town.


317
00:18:39.506 --> 00:18:40.507
They're following you.

318
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.309
Who?

319
00:18:42.342 --> 00:18:43.745
Everyone.

320
00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:45.612
Everything.

321
00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:49.016
Way to narrow it down.

322
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.885
I should've never called.

323
00:18:50.918 --> 00:18:52.787
By bringing you here,
I've cursed your souls.


324
00:18:53.688 --> 00:18:54.889
Hey, is it Margaret?

325
00:18:54.922 --> 00:18:56.389
Margaret, hey, uh,

326
00:18:56.423 --> 00:18:57.892
we've been doing this
for a long time.


327
00:18:57.925 --> 00:19:00.795
We got tons of clients
and everybody's different,


328
00:19:00.828 --> 00:19:04.431
but, uh, my wife,
this lovely lady here --


329
00:19:04.464 --> 00:19:05.700
I love you, babe --
-Thank you.


330
00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:07.567
uh, and myself, uh,
over the years,


331
00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:09.302
we've picked up
on a few, uh,


332
00:19:09.336 --> 00:19:11.706
let's just say,
uh, common themes.


333
00:19:11.739 --> 00:19:13.373
"Oh, no!"

334
00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:15.575
-So scared.
-It's theater.


335
00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:16.811
Then we give

336
00:19:16.844 --> 00:19:18.045
and then you take
a couple minutes


337
00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:20.614
and then here it comes.
-Yeah.


338
00:19:20.648 --> 00:19:21.716
Right?

339
00:19:21.749 --> 00:19:23.718
"Can you lower
the price?"


340
00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:25.418
This one's good,
babe, too --


341
00:19:25.452 --> 00:19:26.788
"It'll be good
for your career."


342
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:28.623
Unh-unh.

343
00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:30.625
Eventually,

344
00:19:30.658 --> 00:19:32.960
you give us the key,

345
00:19:32.994 --> 00:19:34.896
we do our work...
-Mm-hmm.


346
00:19:34.929 --> 00:19:37.597
...and your bookings
skyrocket.


347
00:19:37.632 --> 00:19:39.100
-Fwsssh!
-Fwsssh!


348
00:19:39.133 --> 00:19:40.400
Just like that.
-Just like that.


349
00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:41.434
Like come on, now.

350
00:19:41.468 --> 00:19:42.904
It's late.

351
00:19:42.937 --> 00:19:44.005
We've been on the road

352
00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:45.807
all day.

353
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.843
It's freezing out here,
alright?


354
00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:50.745
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-Uh?


355
00:19:50.778 --> 00:19:52.013
Wait.

356
00:19:52.046 --> 00:19:53.815
We didn't ask for this,
okay, Margaret?


357
00:19:53.848 --> 00:19:56.784
Like we just --
we got a job


358
00:19:56.818 --> 00:19:58.618
and we're here to do
our job, that's it.


359
00:19:58.653 --> 00:20:00.888
Like, we just --
we're just here to do a job.


360
00:20:00.922 --> 00:20:01.923
Do you have kids?

361
00:20:04.859 --> 00:20:06.526
I want to know if I'm sending

362
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.428
a child's parents
to their death.


363
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:10.363
Oh, fuck, no!

364
00:20:10.397 --> 00:20:11.699
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!


365
00:20:11.732 --> 00:20:13.500
Aye, I'm tired
of this bullshit!


366
00:20:13.533 --> 00:20:15.368
Give us the key!

367
00:20:15.402 --> 00:20:19.140
Give us the goddamn
key, now! Fuck!


368
00:20:19.173 --> 00:20:22.109
Thank you!
-Remember, I warned you.


369
00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:23.845
Okay.

370
00:20:23.878 --> 00:20:27.748
The fuck was that all about?

371
00:20:27.782 --> 00:20:29.784
What the fuck
was that, dude?


372
00:20:29.817 --> 00:20:30.918
What?

373
00:20:30.952 --> 00:20:33.621
It's fucking cold
out here!


374
00:20:33.654 --> 00:20:35.957
Shit!
And when you become,


375
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.525
Oh, Miss
We Got a Job to Do?


376
00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:40.761
When I talked to Arn,
he said that he has


377
00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:42.797
something big
for us after this.


378
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.732
What, like a big project

379
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:45.599
or something?
-Yeah.


380
00:20:45.633 --> 00:20:47.467
Like, like Paris big.

381
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.603
Get the fuck out of here.
Paris?!


382
00:20:49.637 --> 00:20:50.972
Are you fucking kidding me?!
-No.


383
00:20:51.005 --> 00:20:52.740
Fucking serious.
-Why didn't you say nothing?


384
00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:54.909
I don't know.
I was just waiting.


385
00:20:54.942 --> 00:20:56.010
-What?!
-Yeah.


386
00:20:56.043 --> 00:20:56.944
Hell yeah.

387
00:20:56.978 --> 00:20:59.714
So...want to

388
00:20:59.747 --> 00:21:01.481
get in there and fuck?

389
00:21:01.514 --> 00:21:02.683
Well, I mean,

390
00:21:02.717 --> 00:21:04.652
fuck yeah, you know.

391
00:21:04.685 --> 00:21:07.054
Oh, my God, man.
Oh, my God.


392
00:21:07.088 --> 00:21:09.724
Shh, shh, shh! You, shh!
-Hold on, wait, wait, wait.


393
00:21:09.757 --> 00:21:11.826
Do you think she's
in here?


394
00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:13.426
Be careful, babe.
Be careful.


395
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.662
Watch where you're going.

396
00:21:14.695 --> 00:21:16.697
Oh, my God, do you think
she's in here?


397
00:21:16.731 --> 00:21:18.032
I don't know.

398
00:21:18.065 --> 00:21:20.433
What did she say?

399
00:21:20.467 --> 00:21:22.870
Your souls are cursed?
Oh.


400
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:24.772
Bullshit!

401
00:21:24.805 --> 00:21:25.940
She knows us, dude.

402
00:21:25.973 --> 00:21:27.842
-Ooh ooh.
-"You're going to die."


403
00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:28.743
Alright.

404
00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.216
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

405
00:21:35.249 --> 00:21:37.051
Our bags. They're outside.
We forgot our bags.


406
00:21:37.084 --> 00:21:38.653
Fuck that, fuck it.
We'll get it later.


407
00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:41.588
C'mere.
-No.


408
00:21:41.622 --> 00:21:42.589
I need to get it.

409
00:21:42.623 --> 00:21:44.025
I need to go get it.

410
00:21:45.226 --> 00:21:47.594
Where's the key at?

411
00:21:47.628 --> 00:21:49.196
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

412
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.665
-Give me the key.
-You mean this one?


413
00:21:50.698 --> 00:21:52.800
Yes.
Yeah, that one.


414
00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:53.801
Oh, you can't have it.

415
00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:54.702
C'mere.

416
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.904
Watch out.

417
00:21:56.938 --> 00:21:58.239
Move.

418
00:21:58.272 --> 00:21:59.807
You want it?
-Come on, give me the keys.


419
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.709
Come get it. Come get it.
You got to work for it.


420
00:22:03.144 --> 00:22:06.681
Babe, I'm so loose right now.

421
00:22:09.717 --> 00:22:10.685
No, babe.

422
00:22:10.718 --> 00:22:11.953
Wait.
Stop playing.


423
00:22:11.986 --> 00:22:13.854
Just come back in here.

424
00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:15.555
Or I'm starting on my own.

425
00:22:15.588 --> 00:22:16.857
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you're --


426
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:18.693
you're going to start
by yourself?


427
00:22:18.726 --> 00:22:20.728
You think that you're going
to be able to finish,


428
00:22:20.761 --> 00:22:22.797
with all that beer
we drank tonight?


429
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.497
There's only one way
to find out.


430
00:22:26.033 --> 00:22:28.202
Where are you going?!

431
00:22:28.235 --> 00:22:29.904
Really?

432
00:22:31.872 --> 00:22:33.207
Hello!

433
00:22:35.009 --> 00:22:37.778
We come in peace!

434
00:22:37.812 --> 00:22:40.848
Just get that
out the way first.


435
00:22:40.881 --> 00:22:43.284
Quick question --

436
00:22:43.317 --> 00:22:46.854
is there a wine cellar
in this beautiful estate?


437
00:22:46.887 --> 00:22:48.856
And, if so,

438
00:22:48.889 --> 00:22:50.992
can you please
show me the way?


439
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:54.729
Anything?

440
00:22:58.099 --> 00:22:59.734
That's alright.

441
00:22:59.767 --> 00:23:01.102
I'll find it myself.

442
00:23:29.063 --> 00:23:32.565
Hart!

443
00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:37.004
Hart!
Come save me!


444
00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:39.006
There's wolves
outside, Hart!


445
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.883
Hart!

446
00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:51.584
Where are you?

447
00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:54.188
Hart.
-I'm loose. Ah!


448
00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:55.689
I was just calling
for you!


449
00:23:55.723 --> 00:23:57.158
Where were you?
-Wow. You know what, man?


450
00:23:57.191 --> 00:24:00.127
I just found this nice
bottle of wine right here.


451
00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:01.896
-Uh-huh.
-Uh, yeah,


452
00:24:01.929 --> 00:24:03.264
it was back there
on the shelf.


453
00:24:03.297 --> 00:24:05.066
I don't think that old-ass
lady's going to miss it.


454
00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:06.267
What do you think?

455
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.835
Well, I don't know.
Do you want to --


456
00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:09.569
You want to fuck
or do you want to drink?


457
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:30.758
Mommy?

458
00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:33.227
Mommy?

459
00:24:35.396 --> 00:24:36.697
Mommy.

460
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.199
I'll kill her.

461
00:24:38.232 --> 00:24:40.034
I'll kill her.
I'll fucking kill
her, Hart!


462
00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:41.635
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Oh, my God, I bet she put


463
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:43.037
fucking cameras every--
Did you check the vents?


464
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.805
Did you check
the lampshades?


465
00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:46.273
There's got to be
a fucking camera
everywhere.


466
00:24:46.307 --> 00:24:48.008
-Easy, easy!
-No! She's been playing


467
00:24:48.042 --> 00:24:49.376
a trick on us
this whole day!


468
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.444
She's a sick,
paranoid person,


469
00:24:50.478 --> 00:24:52.413
so this is a sick joke on us!
-Easy, easy, easy.


470
00:24:52.446 --> 00:24:54.281
Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy.
-It's a sick joke on us!


471
00:24:54.315 --> 00:24:55.416
-Easy!
-No!


472
00:24:55.449 --> 00:24:56.917
She's a paranoid person!

473
00:24:56.951 --> 00:24:59.186
She probably put cameras
and microphones --


474
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.721
Oh, my God,
she put a camera


475
00:25:00.754 --> 00:25:03.057
in every single room
to watch us, Hart.


476
00:25:11.465 --> 00:25:12.333
Aye.

477
00:25:14.101 --> 00:25:16.103
Don't let that woman
get you...upset


478
00:25:16.137 --> 00:25:18.005
like that woman
yesterday, alright?


479
00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:20.374
Yeah, I know.

480
00:25:20.407 --> 00:25:22.109
I just don't know
what it is


481
00:25:22.143 --> 00:25:24.178
about rich people
that just


482
00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:25.446
really gets to me.

483
00:25:25.479 --> 00:25:27.882
Hey, you know, we talked
about it before.


484
00:25:27.915 --> 00:25:30.351
That blog you created
in the past,


485
00:25:30.384 --> 00:25:32.786
you put too much
information out there.


486
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.689
I just wanted
to be famous.


487
00:25:35.723 --> 00:25:37.358
No.

488
00:25:37.391 --> 00:25:40.895
No, I-I just really wanted
to be noticed.


489
00:25:40.928 --> 00:25:43.831
But, naturally, we became
hack celebrities


490
00:25:43.864 --> 00:25:45.900
and the only people
that even notice us


491
00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:47.868
are kooks
or crazy old bitches.


492
00:25:47.902 --> 00:25:50.137
Hey, don't worry
about it.


493
00:25:50.171 --> 00:25:52.206
What do you want to do now?

494
00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:53.774
You know what?
I don't know.


495
00:25:59.013 --> 00:26:00.080
Hey, what's up?!

496
00:26:03.017 --> 00:26:05.252
We just heard Faith
twice.


497
00:26:05.286 --> 00:26:07.755
-Huh?
-Margaret.
She's fucking with us!


498
00:26:07.788 --> 00:26:10.057
This whole thing has been
a bunch of bullshit!


499
00:26:11.292 --> 00:26:13.494
Well, she paid.

500
00:26:13.527 --> 00:26:15.129
Wait, when?

501
00:26:15.162 --> 00:26:16.830
Just now, a few minutes
before you called.


502
00:26:16.864 --> 00:26:18.499
She wired $5,000
to the office.


503
00:26:18.532 --> 00:26:20.234
$5,000?

504
00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:22.269
That's double
what we asked for.


505
00:26:22.303 --> 00:26:24.004
I know.
You know,


506
00:26:24.038 --> 00:26:25.839
and I wasn't obligated
to tell you the truth.


507
00:26:25.873 --> 00:26:27.341
I could've lied,
said it was two grand.


508
00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:28.442
You're such an angel.

509
00:26:28.475 --> 00:26:29.410
Thank you.

510
00:26:29.443 --> 00:26:31.912
Well, you're welcome.

511
00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:33.480
So...
-Ugh!


512
00:26:33.514 --> 00:26:35.249
So, we heard
a little girl.


513
00:26:35.282 --> 00:26:38.485
Maybe it was the wind.

514
00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:39.486
Don't patronize me,
okay?


515
00:26:41.422 --> 00:26:44.525
Guys, you know
what this means?


516
00:26:44.558 --> 00:26:46.827
Ghosts are fucking real!

517
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.063
Oh, my God! We solved it!
-Can you just shut up
for a second?


518
00:26:49.096 --> 00:26:50.864
She's messing with us!

519
00:26:50.898 --> 00:26:53.033
This stuff is going to keep
happening, if we stay here.


520
00:26:53.067 --> 00:26:54.768
Look guys, can you just
roll with it?


521
00:26:54.802 --> 00:26:56.870
Come on, just get in,
get the story, get out.


522
00:26:56.904 --> 00:26:58.973
Alright?
That's exactly
what I was saying.


523
00:26:59.006 --> 00:27:01.976
-Yeah. Now, are you armed?
-That's fucked up.


524
00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:04.078
Hey, you're
in hillbilly country.


525
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:05.346
Me?
I'd buy a gun.


526
00:27:05.379 --> 00:27:07.481
-Should we get a gun?
-No.


527
00:27:07.514 --> 00:27:09.216
Always great talking
to you, Arn.


528
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.085
Peace of mind.

529
00:27:11.118 --> 00:27:14.021
-Bye, Arn.
-Babe, we just got paid double.


530
00:27:14.054 --> 00:27:16.056
Yeah, but now
we can't leave.


531
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.992
I'll...

532
00:27:18.025 --> 00:27:19.126
protect you.

533
00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:20.227
-No, you won't.
-I got you.


534
00:27:20.261 --> 00:27:21.462
-No, okay.
-What do I care


535
00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:22.930
if the old lady
creeping us out?


536
00:27:22.963 --> 00:27:25.065
I got you, babe.
C'mere.


537
00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:26.000
We just got paid double.

538
00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:27.201
Hey!
-Get off me.


539
00:27:27.234 --> 00:27:29.003
Oh, like that?

540
00:27:30.404 --> 00:27:31.438
Wow.

541
00:27:31.472 --> 00:27:32.306
Okay.

542
00:27:33.207 --> 00:27:34.441
Hello?

543
00:27:34.475 --> 00:27:36.243
Margaret, I just wanted
to let you know


544
00:27:36.277 --> 00:27:38.312
that I'm going to be
finishing tonight, instead,


545
00:27:38.345 --> 00:27:40.414
so I need a place that
I can drop off the keys.


546
00:27:40.447 --> 00:27:41.582
Who is this?

547
00:27:41.615 --> 00:27:43.150
Evie Kenneth!

548
00:27:43.183 --> 00:27:44.518
We met at your father's
house last night?


549
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:46.120
Oh, the writer.

550
00:27:46.153 --> 00:27:47.254
How did you sleep?

551
00:27:47.288 --> 00:27:49.023
Very well,
thank you for asking.


552
00:27:49.056 --> 00:27:50.291
-That's unfortunate.
-Hmm.


553
00:27:50.324 --> 00:27:52.960
Where are the cameras
at, Margaret?


554
00:27:52.993 --> 00:27:54.395
Where are the fucking
cameras at, Margaret?!


555
00:28:21.255 --> 00:28:23.457
Hey, I'm just loading up
a few things in the trunk.


556
00:28:27.928 --> 00:28:29.396
Wh
-Where are you going?

557
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.032
Uh...thought I'd

558
00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:34.501
take advantage
of the situation.


559
00:28:34.535 --> 00:28:36.437
Take advantage
of the situation?


560
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.072
Yeah.

561
00:28:38.105 --> 00:28:41.075
This, uh,
this beautiful scenery.


562
00:28:41.108 --> 00:28:42.476
Have you noticed it?

563
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:43.911
I think I'm just going
to go out,


564
00:28:43.944 --> 00:28:47.081
get a few dope shots,
um,


565
00:28:47.114 --> 00:28:48.482
I don't know, I'm just
feeling really inspired.


566
00:28:50.484 --> 00:28:54.254
Well, I'm glad that
you're feeling so good.


567
00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:55.356
Hey.

568
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:57.224
Why don't you come
with me?


569
00:28:57.257 --> 00:29:00.494
I think it'd be a good idea
for you to


570
00:29:00.527 --> 00:29:02.329
get outside the house,
kind of clear your mind


571
00:29:02.363 --> 00:29:03.631
on what happened
a little earlier.


572
00:29:09.036 --> 00:29:11.171
C'mere,
hey, hey, hey, hey.


573
00:29:11.205 --> 00:29:14.375
Hey, everything's going to be
alright, alright? Alright?


574
00:29:14.408 --> 00:29:16.009
Let's just get the job done

575
00:29:16.043 --> 00:29:17.411
and we'll get back home,
alright?


576
00:29:17.444 --> 00:29:20.047
Don't let that lady
throw you off.


577
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.683
You with me, hm?
-Yeah.


578
00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:23.484
-Mmm.
-Yeah, I think that's
a good idea.


579
00:29:23.517 --> 00:29:25.352
Yeah, I know
it's a good idea.


580
00:29:30.692 --> 00:29:34.228
Hey, Arn sent the stuff
about Margaret's dad.


581
00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:35.195
It's on your phone.

582
00:31:30.712 --> 00:31:31.545
I'll be here.

583
00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:13.153
Hey.

584
00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:16.256
You alright?

585
00:32:17.692 --> 00:32:20.427
I'm fine.

586
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.528
How long have we
been here?


587
00:32:25.198 --> 00:32:26.300
About 30 minutes.

588
00:32:28.703 --> 00:32:29.536
Oh.

589
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.338
-What?
-Nothing.


590
00:32:31.371 --> 00:32:35.375
Yo, these shots
are super sick!


591
00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:37.679
Hey, you sure
you're alright?


592
00:32:37.712 --> 00:32:39.112
I'll feel better
when we get back.


593
00:32:39.146 --> 00:32:41.381
I really just should do
that write-up


594
00:32:41.415 --> 00:32:43.150
and then we can
just get out of here.


595
00:32:43.183 --> 00:32:45.252
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But what about


596
00:32:45.285 --> 00:32:46.754
what happened
a little earlier?


597
00:32:46.788 --> 00:32:48.723
I just don't ever want
to see her again.


598
00:32:48.756 --> 00:32:50.390
Hey, you want
to rough her up a bit?


599
00:33:02.837 --> 00:33:05.740
What do you think is
up with Karlov?


600
00:33:05.773 --> 00:33:06.841
Karlov?

601
00:33:07.809 --> 00:33:09.476
Do you believe
in that crap?


602
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:10.678
Come on.

603
00:33:10.712 --> 00:33:11.846
It's creepy.

604
00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:13.280
It's creepy.

605
00:33:13.313 --> 00:33:15.650
Right.
Can we


606
00:33:15.683 --> 00:33:17.618
just relax
on this whole Karlov


607
00:33:17.652 --> 00:33:20.253
stuff?
Come on, now.


608
00:33:20.287 --> 00:33:22.356
I've just been the one
reading the file.


609
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:24.524
I've read the whole file --
-No, but we don't even --


610
00:33:24.558 --> 00:33:25.827
we don't even know.

611
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.629
It was so creepy, Hart.

612
00:33:27.662 --> 00:33:29.329
Evie, what's the, uh --

613
00:33:29.363 --> 00:33:31.365
Arn said something
about Paris.


614
00:33:31.398 --> 00:33:33.500
Did he give you
more details about that,


615
00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:35.770
or...?

616
00:33:35.803 --> 00:33:37.437
Did he?
Yes, no, maybe?


617
00:33:37.471 --> 00:33:38.906
No, I literally --
That's all he told me,


618
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.407
was Paris.
I have no idea.


619
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.843
I don't even --
-It's going to be so exciting.


620
00:33:41.876 --> 00:33:43.610
I've never been to
Paris!


621
00:33:43.645 --> 00:33:45.880
Yeah, but I'm not even
concerned about Paris anymore


622
00:33:45.913 --> 00:33:47.815
because I don't even know
if I want to finish this job.


623
00:33:47.849 --> 00:33:50.317
I just can't think
of anything else,


624
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.853
except what's going on
right now.


625
00:33:51.886 --> 00:33:54.388
Evie.

626
00:33:54.421 --> 00:33:56.958
Paris.
Paris, okay?


627
00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:18.946
Hey.

628
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.247
I'll be back
in a couple hours


629
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.949
and we're outta here,
alright?


630
00:34:21.983 --> 00:34:25.318
I might go back in town,
pick up something, you know,


631
00:34:25.352 --> 00:34:27.421
and, uh, I'll be back.

632
00:34:27.454 --> 00:34:28.823
What has gotten into you?

633
00:34:28.856 --> 00:34:30.323
I was telling you.

634
00:34:30.357 --> 00:34:31.959
I'm super inspired.

635
00:34:31.993 --> 00:34:35.228
You know,
I think this is, uh,


636
00:34:35.262 --> 00:34:36.831
the wake-up call I needed.

637
00:34:36.864 --> 00:34:37.965
Kinda get back into order,

638
00:34:37.999 --> 00:34:39.967
get some things going,
you know.


639
00:34:40.001 --> 00:34:41.703
Alright?
-Okay.


640
00:34:41.736 --> 00:34:43.971
Alright, I'll see you
in a little bit. Alright?


641
00:35:09.697 --> 00:35:13.801
I...win.

642
00:35:13.835 --> 00:35:15.602
You.

643
00:35:29.884 --> 00:35:33.788
I...

644
00:35:33.821 --> 00:35:36.057
see...you.

645
00:36:20.968 --> 00:36:22.069
Mommy.

646
00:36:59.606 --> 00:37:01.008
I see you.

647
00:37:55.696 --> 00:37:56.964
Hey, this is Hart.

648
00:37:56.998 --> 00:37:58.766
Leave a message.

649
00:37:58.799 --> 00:38:01.568
You took the car
and I can't get a ride.


650
00:38:01.601 --> 00:38:03.070
Why aren't you answering?

651
00:39:27.788 --> 00:39:29.556
We open in 15 minutes.

652
00:39:31.158 --> 00:39:32.960
Can I wait here?

653
00:39:32.994 --> 00:39:36.130
Sure.
Rough day?


654
00:39:36.163 --> 00:39:37.698
More like a rough year.

655
00:39:41.769 --> 00:39:42.970
On me.

656
00:39:43.004 --> 00:39:44.939
This is what you had
last night, yeah?


657
00:39:44.972 --> 00:39:47.174
Yeah. Good memory.
Thank you.


658
00:39:58.052 --> 00:40:00.054
What's your name?

659
00:40:00.087 --> 00:40:00.955
Evie Kenneth.

660
00:40:03.891 --> 00:40:06.260
Evie Kenneth.

661
00:40:06.293 --> 00:40:07.995
Wikipedia.

662
00:40:08.029 --> 00:40:10.297
Amazon Reads!

663
00:40:10.331 --> 00:40:12.066
Audible?
-I'm on Audible?


664
00:40:12.099 --> 00:40:15.870
You're in hiding
'cause you're a celebrity.


665
00:40:17.705 --> 00:40:18.605
Nope.

666
00:40:25.646 --> 00:40:28.182
So I heard
my daughter today.


667
00:40:28.215 --> 00:40:30.583
It must've been like
a recording,


668
00:40:30.617 --> 00:40:32.585
but I just --
I don't understand.
Like how could she


669
00:40:32.619 --> 00:40:34.121
have gotten a recording
of a girl


670
00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:36.589
that sounded just like
my daughter?


671
00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:39.260
That must sound crazy
to you.


672
00:40:46.834 --> 00:40:47.802
Where are you staying?

673
00:40:50.337 --> 00:40:51.571
You seem nice.

674
00:40:54.008 --> 00:40:55.076
Tell me why you're here.

675
00:40:56.911 --> 00:41:00.848
I'm doing a job
at the magician's house.


676
00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:02.917
Uh...Karlov.

677
00:41:08.322 --> 00:41:08.989
Really?

678
00:41:11.725 --> 00:41:12.860
Do you know him
or something?


679
00:41:14.795 --> 00:41:17.998
Guess I'll just help myself.

680
00:41:43.057 --> 00:41:44.291
Hart!

681
00:41:44.325 --> 00:41:46.127
Hart!

682
00:41:59.807 --> 00:42:02.877
What the fuck, man?

683
00:42:06.947 --> 00:42:08.315
Hey, you alright?

684
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:09.884
Where have you been?!

685
00:42:11.085 --> 00:42:12.887
I told you --
I was taking photos.


686
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.388
Yeah, but I texted
and you didn't answer.


687
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:17.158
Yeah, I was actually
by the river, babe.


688
00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:18.159
I...

689
00:42:19.493 --> 00:42:20.861
...couldn't hear.

690
00:42:20.895 --> 00:42:22.763
The river was so loud.

691
00:42:22.796 --> 00:42:24.832
I didn't see it
until I got back here.


692
00:42:24.865 --> 00:42:26.433
Where'd you go?
-I went into town and, babe,


693
00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:28.802
everybody's acting
so weird!


694
00:42:28.836 --> 00:42:30.171
Look at this.

695
00:42:30.204 --> 00:42:32.806
You forgot to lock
the front door.


696
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.475
I heard footsteps
and I got scared.


697
00:42:34.508 --> 00:42:37.778
Oh, baby got scared.

698
00:42:37.811 --> 00:42:39.146
Stop!

699
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.347
Stop messing with me.

700
00:42:40.381 --> 00:42:42.016
I'm being serious!
-What's up, what?


701
00:42:42.049 --> 00:42:43.384
I'm being serious.
She's messing with us


702
00:42:43.417 --> 00:42:44.818
and I think that we need
to leave.


703
00:42:44.852 --> 00:42:47.421
Ah, what about the job
we got to do?


704
00:42:47.454 --> 00:42:49.857
I'm being really serious.

705
00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.725
I think this lady's
messing with us


706
00:42:51.759 --> 00:42:53.394
and everybody in town's
acting really creepy.


707
00:42:53.427 --> 00:42:56.430
Everybody's in town
acting real creepy.


708
00:42:56.463 --> 00:42:57.331
Uh...

709
00:42:58.966 --> 00:43:01.068
...what people?
-Everybody in town.


710
00:43:01.101 --> 00:43:04.371
They seem...
pretty cool to me.


711
00:43:04.405 --> 00:43:06.006
Yeah, well,
they're not fine.


712
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.042
Did anything happen, weird,
while I was gone?


713
00:43:10.477 --> 00:43:16.083
No, I just, uh,
got a nice bottle of wine


714
00:43:16.116 --> 00:43:18.786
and, uh,
popped that bad boy open.


715
00:43:20.254 --> 00:43:22.323
Oh, my God. I'm thrilled
that you did that.


716
00:43:22.356 --> 00:43:23.390
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


717
00:43:23.424 --> 00:43:25.125
I, uh,

718
00:43:25.159 --> 00:43:27.127
I'm feeling really good,
you know?


719
00:43:27.161 --> 00:43:29.263
And, uh, you know,

720
00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:30.764
we just got to get you
to lighten up


721
00:43:30.798 --> 00:43:32.533
a little bit, alright?
We'll leave tonight.


722
00:43:32.566 --> 00:43:34.802
Hey, we'll leave tonight.

723
00:43:34.835 --> 00:43:35.903
How's the writing
coming along?


724
00:43:35.936 --> 00:43:37.338
Writing's good,
you know,


725
00:43:37.371 --> 00:43:39.206
I'll be done in just --
just like a few hours.


726
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.774
That's my girl, yeah.

727
00:43:40.808 --> 00:43:42.509
I just got a couple more
shots, we'll knock it out,


728
00:43:42.543 --> 00:43:44.812
and we'll be up outta here
before the sun goes down.


729
00:44:17.278 --> 00:44:18.112
Hart!

730
00:44:22.383 --> 00:44:23.250
Hart.

731
00:44:23.284 --> 00:44:24.985
It's all gone.

732
00:44:25.019 --> 00:44:26.120
It's all gone.

733
00:44:26.153 --> 00:44:27.388
I was writing.
-What's gone?


734
00:44:27.421 --> 00:44:28.922
I was writing
all morning.


735
00:44:28.956 --> 00:44:31.825
I was writing all morning.

736
00:44:31.859 --> 00:44:34.128
It didn't autosave?

737
00:44:34.161 --> 00:44:35.963
This is autosave.

738
00:44:35.996 --> 00:44:37.564
They're all blank.

739
00:44:37.598 --> 00:44:38.832
You think I did this?

740
00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:40.434
Well, hey, it's not here.

741
00:44:42.936 --> 00:44:45.439
-No, Hart.
-It's little things, Evie.


742
00:44:45.472 --> 00:44:47.107
-No.
-You can't do the detail stuff.


743
00:44:47.141 --> 00:44:48.575
All the time.
-I didn't do this!


744
00:44:48.609 --> 00:44:51.578
-Stuff like this happens --
-I did not do this.


745
00:44:51.612 --> 00:44:53.580
It's gone. I was literally
writing all morning.


746
00:44:53.614 --> 00:44:56.116
All of it's gone.

747
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.052
I'm not going to do this.

748
00:44:58.085 --> 00:44:59.219
I'm done.
I'm done.


749
00:45:00.888 --> 00:45:02.056
Take your photos.
-Yeah.


750
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:03.524
-We need to leave.
-Alright.


751
00:45:03.557 --> 00:45:05.526
What are you going to do?
That's the question.


752
00:45:05.559 --> 00:45:08.362
It seems like I'm doing
all the work.


753
00:45:08.395 --> 00:45:10.431
As usual.

754
00:45:16.937 --> 00:45:17.938
Do you have signal?

755
00:45:20.908 --> 00:45:22.042
Do you have signal?!

756
00:45:22.076 --> 00:45:23.010
What's that, babe?

757
00:45:26.113 --> 00:45:28.515
I haven't had any service
since I got back.


758
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.292
Yeah, that's weird.

759
00:45:38.325 --> 00:45:39.426
Don't worry about it.

760
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.394
We're about to head
out, anyway.


761
00:45:42.096 --> 00:45:45.566
Yeah, but, I had service
last night.


762
00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:47.968
You know,
this whole thing


763
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:49.536
has been really
messed up, Hart.


764
00:45:51.004 --> 00:45:52.272
I just really want
to leave.


765
00:45:53.574 --> 00:45:55.309
You're acting
paranoid now.


766
00:45:55.342 --> 00:45:57.244
Relax.

767
00:45:57.277 --> 00:45:58.412
Did you hear her
this morning?


768
00:46:00.648 --> 00:46:02.249
I got shots to take.

769
00:46:02.282 --> 00:46:05.119
I don't know what I heard,
but can I finish my job?


770
00:46:06.688 --> 00:46:08.222
Alright?

771
00:46:08.255 --> 00:46:09.123
Thank you.

772
00:46:19.566 --> 00:46:22.102
-Hello.
-You guys aren't
answering your phones.


773
00:46:22.136 --> 00:46:24.071
I need a constant stream
of attention.


774
00:46:24.104 --> 00:46:25.572
We don't have signal, Arn.

775
00:46:27.374 --> 00:46:28.710
These people
are so messed up.


776
00:46:28.743 --> 00:46:30.210
We're going to leave.
-Whoa, easy.


777
00:46:30.244 --> 00:46:31.979
Evie, Evie, come on.

778
00:46:32.012 --> 00:46:33.180
You just don't get it, okay?

779
00:46:33.213 --> 00:46:34.448
This isn't really
up for discussion.


780
00:46:34.481 --> 00:46:35.616
We're going to leave now.
-Hold on!


781
00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.418
Listen to me.

782
00:46:37.451 --> 00:46:39.186
Guys --
-Arn!


783
00:46:39.219 --> 00:46:42.156
-Hey.
-What did my wife just tell you?


784
00:46:42.189 --> 00:46:43.056
We're leaving!

785
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.291
No, you're not.

786
00:46:44.324 --> 00:46:45.693
It's my ass
on the line, too.


787
00:46:45.727 --> 00:46:47.094
Look, we need this story

788
00:46:47.127 --> 00:46:49.631
to sell the book
and move on.


789
00:46:49.664 --> 00:46:51.031
What is it
with you guys?


790
00:46:51.064 --> 00:46:51.999
Put her back on.

791
00:46:55.269 --> 00:46:56.403
You know,
you're not here, so,


792
00:46:56.437 --> 00:46:58.071
you just don't
understand, okay?


793
00:46:58.105 --> 00:47:00.574
You called me from a bar
last night, wasted.


794
00:47:00.607 --> 00:47:02.142
Now, you're paranoid.

795
00:47:02.176 --> 00:47:03.343
I'm putting two
and two together.


796
00:47:03.377 --> 00:47:04.445
Come on.

797
00:47:04.478 --> 00:47:06.648
Finish the job.

798
00:47:06.681 --> 00:47:07.514
Hello?

799
00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:19.493
You okay?

800
00:47:19.526 --> 00:47:21.195
Yeah, I'm alright,
I'm alright, yeah.


801
00:47:22.496 --> 00:47:23.997
I just got
a bad migraine.


802
00:47:40.414 --> 00:47:41.281
Let's go!

803
00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.184
Come on!

804
00:47:47.054 --> 00:47:48.121
Shit.
The battery's dead.


805
00:47:48.155 --> 00:47:49.456
How?

806
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.325
-It's old.
-Oh, fuck.


807
00:47:51.358 --> 00:47:52.526
Did you leave
something on?!


808
00:47:54.796 --> 00:47:56.296
It was daylight.

809
00:47:57.564 --> 00:47:58.766
Then how did this happen?!
-Who the fuck


810
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.334
you talking to?!
-How did this happen?!


811
00:48:00.367 --> 00:48:01.703
Yo, it's not my fault!

812
00:48:01.736 --> 00:48:03.070
Damn!
-You were the last
person to drive,


813
00:48:03.103 --> 00:48:04.171
so, this is your fault!

814
00:48:06.741 --> 00:48:08.141
Who are you calling?

815
00:48:08.175 --> 00:48:09.243
Who are you calling
right now?


816
00:48:09.276 --> 00:48:10.410
Who are you calling?
-Damn.


817
00:48:10.444 --> 00:48:11.746
I forgot
we don't have service.


818
00:48:11.779 --> 00:48:14.114
Oh, just like you forgot
about something that --


819
00:48:14.147 --> 00:48:15.717
Shut the fuck up!

820
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.150
Evie, I am sorry.

821
00:48:17.184 --> 00:48:18.218
I didn't mean to do that!

822
00:48:20.788 --> 00:48:22.356
Evie!
Evie!


823
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.525
Evie!

824
00:48:26.593 --> 00:48:27.494
Evie.

825
00:48:28.161 --> 00:48:29.029
Evie!

826
00:48:31.766 --> 00:48:35.502
You're in my world.

827
00:48:35.536 --> 00:48:36.838
My world.

828
00:51:17.665 --> 00:51:18.866
Evie!

829
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.868
Ah, thank God!

830
00:51:20.902 --> 00:51:22.003
Are you okay?

831
00:51:22.036 --> 00:51:23.705
-You hit me.
-I-I know.


832
00:51:23.738 --> 00:51:25.707
It was an accident.
I'm sorry.


833
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.842
But I'm not trying
to make excuses,


834
00:51:27.875 --> 00:51:29.811
but there's something off
about that house, though.


835
00:51:29.844 --> 00:51:30.978
My energy is off.

836
00:51:31.012 --> 00:51:32.747
I-I don't know.
I-I'm just --


837
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.315
It's like I'm a complete
different person.


838
00:51:35.348 --> 00:51:37.350
You hear me?
And when you took off,


839
00:51:37.384 --> 00:51:39.586
I went back inside the
house, knocked out.


840
00:51:39.619 --> 00:51:41.488
When I woke up,
you weren't there.


841
00:51:41.521 --> 00:51:43.590
Got worried
and so here I am.


842
00:51:43.624 --> 00:51:45.893
Why are we still
here, Hart?!


843
00:51:45.927 --> 00:51:47.527
Why are we still here?!

844
00:51:47.561 --> 00:51:48.663
Okay?
We could just walk.


845
00:51:48.696 --> 00:51:49.864
It's only 20 miles.

846
00:51:49.897 --> 00:51:51.866
We could walk all the way
back home.


847
00:51:51.899 --> 00:51:53.333
We could walk
down the mountain.


848
00:51:53.366 --> 00:51:54.869
We could just --
We could do that.


849
00:51:54.902 --> 00:51:57.638
Why are --
Why are we still here?!


850
00:51:57.672 --> 00:51:58.940
-That way?
-Yes!


851
00:51:58.973 --> 00:52:00.440
In the dark?

852
00:52:00.474 --> 00:52:01.308
Freezing?

853
00:52:01.341 --> 00:52:03.010
I'm not cold!

854
00:52:03.044 --> 00:52:04.946
Evie, you're drunk,
alright?


855
00:52:04.979 --> 00:52:06.781
And I know
how you operate.


856
00:52:06.814 --> 00:52:08.683
We get to walking,
marching down that way,


857
00:52:08.716 --> 00:52:11.384
a mile away,
even maybe before,


858
00:52:11.418 --> 00:52:12.619
and then you're going
to start pleading


859
00:52:12.653 --> 00:52:13.821
for me to carry you

860
00:52:13.855 --> 00:52:15.288
and that's not going
to happen.


861
00:52:17.524 --> 00:52:19.761
Fine.
Fine.


862
00:52:19.794 --> 00:52:21.361
But I'm walking
in the morning.


863
00:52:21.394 --> 00:52:22.529
Alright.

864
00:52:22.562 --> 00:52:24.031
That's a good idea,
actually.


865
00:52:24.065 --> 00:52:26.399
And guess what. I'mma be
right there with you.


866
00:52:29.904 --> 00:52:30.938
Promise?

867
00:52:30.972 --> 00:52:32.506
Of course.

868
00:52:32.539 --> 00:52:34.341
You know I got you,
babe, alright?


869
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:37.745
Lookit, we just got to be
smart about this, alright?


870
00:52:37.779 --> 00:52:40.014
We go back to the house,
get some rest.


871
00:52:40.047 --> 00:52:41.314
First thing in the morning,

872
00:52:41.348 --> 00:52:42.950
we get the hell
out of Dodge.


873
00:52:42.984 --> 00:52:44.986
You with me?
Forget about the project,


874
00:52:45.019 --> 00:52:47.655
forget about Arn,
all of this.


875
00:52:47.688 --> 00:52:49.824
Me and you, back home,
okay?


876
00:52:49.857 --> 00:52:50.691
Alright.

877
00:52:50.725 --> 00:52:51.391
Alright.

878
00:52:52.693 --> 00:52:53.861
But if you ever
hit me again,


879
00:52:53.895 --> 00:52:55.529
I'm going
to fucking kill you.


880
00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.440
Stop.

881
00:53:07.474 --> 00:53:08.341
Don't.

882
00:54:31.225 --> 00:54:33.493
Aah!

883
00:54:41.869 --> 00:54:43.671
Aah!

884
00:55:02.522 --> 00:55:04.725
She was hollow inside.

885
00:55:04.759 --> 00:55:08.029
She was
hollow inside.


886
00:56:54.702 --> 00:56:58.605
Baby Faith:

887
00:57:30.938 --> 00:57:33.074
-Can I borrow your phone?
-What's wrong with yours?


888
00:57:33.107 --> 00:57:35.342
-I don't have a signal.
-Yeah, you do.


889
00:57:35.376 --> 00:57:37.945
Tried telling you
yesterday, but,


890
00:57:37.978 --> 00:57:40.915
seemed like you were
pretty out of it.


891
00:57:40.948 --> 00:57:41.882
When did I get these?

892
00:57:44.118 --> 00:57:45.986
Yeah, cool,
nice talking to you, too.


893
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:01.936
I've been trying
to reach you again.


894
00:58:01.969 --> 00:58:03.871
I swear I haven't
had a signal.


895
00:58:03.904 --> 00:58:06.273
Okay, but what
about the house?


896
00:58:06.307 --> 00:58:08.075
-What about the house?
-I called the house


897
00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:08.976
three times today.

898
00:58:09.009 --> 00:58:09.944
Nobody picked up.

899
00:58:09.977 --> 00:58:11.645
Yeah, I had to go out.

900
00:58:13.314 --> 00:58:14.849
Some stuff happened
this morning.


901
00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:16.650
-Yeah?
-You know what?


902
00:58:16.684 --> 00:58:18.252
Forget about it. I don't
want to talk about it.


903
00:58:18.285 --> 00:58:19.987
Look, where's Hart?

904
00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.322
God, I don't know

905
00:58:21.355 --> 00:58:23.023
and I really
don't fucking care.


906
00:58:23.057 --> 00:58:24.125
What happened?

907
00:58:24.158 --> 00:58:26.727
I said forget about it,
okay?


908
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.295
You know what?

909
00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:29.997
I'm just going to go
get a mechanic


910
00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:31.332
and I'm going
to drive home.


911
00:58:31.365 --> 00:58:32.833
Why do you need
a mechanic?


912
00:58:32.867 --> 00:58:34.168
Because the car's dead.

913
00:58:35.903 --> 00:58:37.138
Evie...

914
00:58:37.171 --> 00:58:38.906
Shut up, Arn!
It's your fucking fault


915
00:58:38.939 --> 00:58:40.441
that I'm in this
goddamn mess!


916
00:58:40.474 --> 00:58:41.976
God!
You know what?


917
00:58:42.009 --> 00:58:43.410
I just really can't
with you right now.


918
00:58:43.444 --> 00:58:45.746
I was calling
to apologize.


919
00:58:45.779 --> 00:58:47.982
I know it's
her birthday today.


920
00:58:48.015 --> 00:58:49.383
Evie.
-Oh, shit, I forgot.


921
00:58:49.416 --> 00:58:51.752
I forgot.

922
00:58:51.785 --> 00:58:54.021
-Look, it's alright.
-No, it's not fucking alright!


923
00:58:54.054 --> 00:58:55.189
I'm her goddamn mother!

924
00:58:56.323 --> 00:58:58.425
I'm not supposed to forg--
fucking forget.


925
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.061
Oh, Evie.

926
00:59:01.095 --> 00:59:02.363
I'm sorry.

927
00:59:07.735 --> 00:59:09.270
Evie, we need to talk
about what happened.


928
00:59:09.303 --> 00:59:11.005
I don't have anything
to say to you!


929
00:59:11.939 --> 00:59:14.175
Get back here, Evie!

930
00:59:14.208 --> 00:59:15.309
Get over here!

931
00:59:18.913 --> 00:59:19.780
Do it!

932
00:59:21.482 --> 00:59:22.383
Do it.

933
01:00:31.452 --> 01:00:32.786
Oh!

934
01:00:34.321 --> 01:00:36.457
Evie.

935
01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:38.826
You're safe.

936
01:00:38.859 --> 01:00:41.262
Yes, Evie.

937
01:00:41.295 --> 01:00:43.430
Rest, Evie.

938
01:00:43.464 --> 01:00:46.100
You're okay now.

939
01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:47.568
You're okay now.

940
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:49.436
You're home.

941
01:00:51.472 --> 01:00:53.173
You're home.

942
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:55.943
You're home.

943
01:01:27.007 --> 01:01:27.975
Oh, God.

944
01:01:38.585 --> 01:01:40.487
Aah! Aah!

945
01:01:40.521 --> 01:01:41.355
Aaaaah!

946
01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:16.423
It's not real.

947
01:02:18.992 --> 01:02:19.860
It's not real.

948
01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:23.297
This isn't real.

949
01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:24.264
This isn't real.

950
01:02:26.967 --> 01:02:27.868
This isn't real.

951
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.441
It's going through.

952
01:02:34.475 --> 01:02:36.377
It's going to go through
because this isn't real.


953
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:38.979
This isn't real.

954
01:02:39.012 --> 01:02:41.281
Hi.
This is Evie Kenneth.


955
01:02:41.315 --> 01:02:45.386
I'm at 17811 Kitamuk Point.

956
01:02:45.419 --> 01:02:46.621
I really need your help.

957
01:02:46.654 --> 01:02:48.389
Stay on the line,
ma'am.


958
01:02:48.422 --> 01:02:49.390
Help is on the way.

959
01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:53.293
Are you injured?
-No. No.


960
01:02:53.327 --> 01:02:54.395
You will be.

961
01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:56.930
You will be.

962
01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:00.134
You will be.

963
01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:11.945
E...

964
01:03:11.979 --> 01:03:13.447
...vie...

965
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:16.984
Ah...

966
01:03:17.017 --> 01:03:18.619
E...

967
01:03:18.653 --> 01:03:20.921
...vie...

968
01:03:52.386 --> 01:03:54.722
E...

969
01:03:54.756 --> 01:03:57.391
...vie...

970
01:03:57.424 --> 01:03:59.159
Baby Faith:

971
01:03:59.193 --> 01:04:02.329
You might be
asking yourself,


972
01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:03.997
"Why, Hart?

973
01:04:04.031 --> 01:04:04.965
I love you."

974
01:04:06.533 --> 01:04:07.401
Do you?

975
01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:10.672
Do you really love me?

976
01:04:10.705 --> 01:04:12.473
But I loved Faith!
Faith:


977
01:04:12.506 --> 01:04:17.177
I loved that little girl,
just like she was my own!


978
01:04:17.211 --> 01:04:18.579
I loved you as well.

979
01:04:18.612 --> 01:04:20.481
Baby Faith:

980
01:04:20.514 --> 01:04:23.383
But maybe just
a little too much.


981
01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.623
'Cause I don't think
you were that into me,


982
01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:30.023
at least before him.

983
01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:33.795
Faith gets really sick.

984
01:04:35.229 --> 01:04:36.430
Then your dude finds out

985
01:04:36.463 --> 01:04:39.233
how much of a fucking
train wreck you are.


986
01:04:39.266 --> 01:04:40.635
Splits!

987
01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:42.336
Then you call me!

988
01:04:42.369 --> 01:04:43.203
Me!

989
01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:46.808
The place we rent,
the car we drive --


990
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.343
it's always about Evie!

991
01:04:50.477 --> 01:04:53.413
Hell, you introduced me
as your assistant!


992
01:04:53.447 --> 01:04:55.616
I'm your goddamn husband!

993
01:04:56.818 --> 01:04:58.318
You understand me?!

994
01:05:05.259 --> 01:05:07.494
You're not getting out
this fucking house alive,


995
01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:08.796
you stupid bitch!

996
01:05:19.306 --> 01:05:20.207
Aah!

997
01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:23.711
Aaaaaaah!

998
01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:24.712
Aaaaah!

999
01:05:24.746 --> 01:05:25.579
Move!

1000
01:05:40.294 --> 01:05:47.769
Aaaaah!

1001
01:05:47.802 --> 01:05:50.137
You never loved me!

1002
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:51.538
-Yes, I did.
-No, you didn't!


1003
01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:53.540
Stop lying!
Stop lying to me!


1004
01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.777
-I did! I love you!
-No, you didn't!


1005
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.277
-No, you didn't!
-I did!


1006
01:05:57.311 --> 01:05:58.545
All those years!

1007
01:05:58.579 --> 01:05:59.847
All these years wasted!

1008
01:05:59.881 --> 01:06:01.448
-No!
-All those years.


1009
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:03.685
Why are you doing this
to us?


1010
01:06:03.718 --> 01:06:04.752
Why?
-I can't control it.


1011
01:06:06.286 --> 01:06:07.722
Karlov --

1012
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:11.124
What -- What are you
doing this for?


1013
01:06:16.263 --> 01:06:17.331
Ahhh.

1014
01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:20.133
Ah.

1015
01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:20.902
Ah.

1016
01:06:46.259 --> 01:06:47.527
It's okay.

1017
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:48.730
It's okay, baby.

1018
01:06:48.763 --> 01:06:49.631
It's okay.

1019
01:06:52.432 --> 01:06:53.801
Stay with me.

1020
01:06:53.835 --> 01:06:54.769
Stay with me.

1021
01:06:59.606 --> 01:07:00.642
He needs a doctor.

1022
01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.214
So go.

1023
01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:14.956
Okay.

1024
01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:15.823
Okay.

1025
01:07:30.404 --> 01:07:31.271
Go!

1026
01:07:33.273 --> 01:07:34.909
Go!

1027
01:07:34.942 --> 01:07:36.443
Hart. Hart.

1028
01:08:04.739 --> 01:08:06.573
Thank you all for coming.

1029
01:08:06.606 --> 01:08:09.576
This book is something
I'm very, very proud of.


1030
01:08:09.609 --> 01:08:10.945
It took a very long time
to write it


1031
01:08:10.978 --> 01:08:14.381
because I had to find
the courage to write it.


1032
01:08:14.414 --> 01:08:17.250
Now, I had a wonderful life.

1033
01:08:17.284 --> 01:08:18.986
At least, I did
until I was a mother.


1034
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:22.322
I know that's a terrible
thing to say, but,


1035
01:08:22.355 --> 01:08:24.558
at least,
I can admit that I failed.


1036
01:08:24.591 --> 01:08:26.460
I failed my marriage.

1037
01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:28.361
I failed my child.

1038
01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.864
A lot of terrible
things happened.


1039
01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:31.766
Now, this isn't a biography.

1040
01:08:31.799 --> 01:08:33.735
This is fiction.

1041
01:08:33.768 --> 01:08:35.569
Some of it's fiction.

1042
01:08:35.602 --> 01:08:37.672
I guess most of it's
actually fiction.


1043
01:08:37.705 --> 01:08:39.974
So, if you have any questions,
I'll be very happy to --


1044
01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:44.377
Thank you for coming.
Have a nice day.


1045
01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:45.479
Hi.
Thank you for coming.


1046
01:08:45.512 --> 01:08:46.681
Who do I make it out to?
-Lisa.


1047
01:08:48.983 --> 01:08:49.851
Thank you.

1048
01:08:51.318 --> 01:08:52.319
Hi.
-Hi.


1049
01:08:52.352 --> 01:08:53.553
-Who do I make it out to?
-Emily.


1050
01:08:55.723 --> 01:08:56.991
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.


1051
01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:00.928
Do you remember me?

1052
01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:02.329
I do.

1053
01:09:02.362 --> 01:09:04.699
Faith isn't my real name.

1054
01:09:04.732 --> 01:09:06.768
So, who do I
make it out to?


1055
01:09:06.801 --> 01:09:07.668
Taki.

1056
01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:12.572
I'm sorry.

1057
01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:13.473
It's okay.

1058
01:09:15.575 --> 01:09:16.409
Hi.

1059
01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.921
You, uh, done with all this
nostalgia shit?


1060
01:09:26.954 --> 01:09:28.321
We need to hit
some big cities.


1061
01:09:28.355 --> 01:09:29.657
This is not worth
our time.


1062
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:31.358
Hm, our time?

1063
01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:32.459
Yeah, that's right.
Come on.


1064
01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:33.593
You write 'em,
I sell 'em.


1065
01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:36.063
It's a yin-yang
relationship.


1066
01:09:36.097 --> 01:09:37.799
I don't think that's
what that means.


1067
01:09:37.832 --> 01:09:40.067
Okay, Mary Sue.

1068
01:09:40.101 --> 01:09:41.601
You know, I wasn't
really too happy


1069
01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:42.602
with how I was portrayed.

1070
01:09:42.637 --> 01:09:45.572
I know. You have
told me quite often.


1071
01:09:45.605 --> 01:09:47.340
Oh, well, it's true,
you know.


1072
01:09:47.374 --> 01:09:49.644
I don't think it was fair,
you know. It was kind of


1073
01:09:49.677 --> 01:09:50.778
-Hey.
-harsh, don't you think?
You were


1074
01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:52.379
-How's it going?
-a little bit harsh on that
and...


1075
01:09:52.412 --> 01:09:53.748
Yeah I just finished
with the signing.


1076
01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:55.448
...look, I just tried
to do my best and...
-It was pretty good.


1077
01:09:55.482 --> 01:09:57.718
...it's --
-It was a decent turnout.


1078
01:09:57.752 --> 01:09:58.552
Good talk.

1079
01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.420
Sure, I should be able
to come over


1080
01:10:00.453 --> 01:10:01.088
right after this.

1081
01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:05.960
- Hey.
- Hey.


1082
01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:06.961
Changed your hair.

1083
01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.729
-I did.
-I like it.


1084
01:10:08.763 --> 01:10:10.131
-Thank you.
-So, how'd it go,


1085
01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:11.431
better than last time?

1086
01:10:11.464 --> 01:10:13.034
Much better.

1087
01:10:13.067 --> 01:10:14.501
Nice.

1088
01:10:14.534 --> 01:10:16.103
Actually...

1089
01:10:16.137 --> 01:10:17.939
No, don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.


1090
01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:18.906
No...

1091
01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.907
None of my photographs was

1092
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:21.441
in this project.

1093
01:10:21.474 --> 01:10:23.711
Hart.

1094
01:10:23.744 --> 01:10:25.412
Some things just don't
change, huh?


1095
01:10:27.414 --> 01:10:28.816
Oh, shit!

1096
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:29.984
Like that?

1097
01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:32.019
Wow!

1098
01:10:32.053 --> 01:10:33.888
Damn, I need to start
getting into writing, huh?


1099
01:10:35.422 --> 01:10:36.389
How are you doing?

1100
01:10:36.423 --> 01:10:37.992
I'm good.

1101
01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:40.728
I haven't been back
to Paris yet, but,


1102
01:10:40.761 --> 01:10:42.129
New York has been good.

1103
01:10:42.163 --> 01:10:43.563
Yeah, I saw that.

1104
01:10:43.597 --> 01:10:45.132
Baby steps, right?

1105
01:10:45.166 --> 01:10:46.533
Right.

1106
01:10:46.566 --> 01:10:48.468
So, have you been
seeing anyone?


1107
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:49.837
No.

1108
01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:50.705
You?

1109
01:10:52.006 --> 01:10:53.674
No, I think I'm done
with the love thing


1110
01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:54.809
for a little while.

1111
01:10:54.842 --> 01:10:55.810
Yeah.

1112
01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:00.580
You know we really
had something.


1113
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.487
Take care of yourself,
Hart.


1114
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.923
You too, Evie.

1115
01:11:09.824 --> 01:11:11.826
Evie.

1116
01:11:11.859 --> 01:11:12.994
Have a little faith, right?

1117
01:11:31.946 --> 01:11:32.813
Hey, Evie.

1118
01:11:34.815 --> 01:11:36.050
I'm glad you came back.

1119
01:11:38.986 --> 01:11:40.520
In the mountain,

1120
01:11:40.553 --> 01:11:43.224
all the things
that were happening --


1121
01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:44.158
how?

1122
01:11:49.562 --> 01:11:52.066
I think it might be better
if you didn't know.


1123
01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:54.001
I mean, we can always

1124
01:11:54.035 --> 01:11:56.771
take out the Ouija board
and ask it.


1125
01:11:56.804 --> 01:11:59.006
I saw my daughter,
though.


1126
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.476
What was she,
a spirit, a dream?


1127
01:12:05.646 --> 01:12:06.747
Could I see her again?

1128
01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.251
Maybe.

1129
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.850
Mom?
Mom!


1130
01:13:15.883 --> 01:13:18.052
Mom? Mom!

1131
01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:16.877
No.

1132
01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.245
No, it's okay.

1133
01:14:19.713 --> 01:14:21.348
Be quiet!

1134
01:14:21.382 --> 01:14:22.783
I said, be quiet!

1135
01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:25.653
I said, be quiet!

1136
01:14:36.163 --> 01:14:37.198
It's quite good.

1137
01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.134
Oh, you're awake!

1138
01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.105
That's fantastic!

1139
01:14:44.138 --> 01:14:47.041
Margaret sends
her condolences.


1140
01:14:47.074 --> 01:14:48.209
Margaret, yes.

1141
01:14:48.242 --> 01:14:51.145
She's back!

1142
01:14:51.178 --> 01:14:52.780
She is busy!

1143
01:14:52.813 --> 01:14:55.649
She's on a whirlwind
press tour.


1144
01:14:57.418 --> 01:15:00.121
All your words.

1145
01:15:00.154 --> 01:15:02.656
They're going to reach
millions, Evie.


1146
01:15:04.391 --> 01:15:06.127
What's wrong?

1147
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.862
Isn't that
what you wanted?


1148
01:15:07.895 --> 01:15:09.797
Wh
-Where -
- Where am I?

1149
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:11.932
In a little slice
of my head.


1150
01:15:13.234 --> 01:15:14.268
Of my head.

1151
01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:17.238
It bends and it stretches,

1152
01:15:17.271 --> 01:15:19.840
but it still remains a box.

1153
01:15:20.841 --> 01:15:22.676
My box.

1154
01:15:22.710 --> 01:15:27.715
All these self-loathing,
miserable artists


1155
01:15:27.748 --> 01:15:29.016
and this town,

1156
01:15:29.049 --> 01:15:29.984
together.

1157
01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.954
I'll tell you a secret.

1158
01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:37.791
All these hicks...

1159
01:15:39.226 --> 01:15:41.762
...they're millionaires
because of you.


1160
01:15:41.795 --> 01:15:44.165
You're our hero, Evie.

1161
01:15:44.198 --> 01:15:45.232
They can have the money.

1162
01:15:45.266 --> 01:15:47.101
They've already done it.

1163
01:15:50.137 --> 01:15:52.239
Time's relative, here.

1164
01:15:54.141 --> 01:15:56.243
It can even cheat death.

1165
01:15:56.277 --> 01:15:58.445
- Mom.
- Come play with me, Mommy.


1166
01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:00.915
Come play with me, Mommy.

1167
01:16:06.487 --> 01:16:09.456
The last time
you showed her love,


1168
01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:12.359
she was dying
in your arms.


1169
01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:14.495
She was dying!

1170
01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.397
And you used it
to marry him.


1171
01:16:18.399 --> 01:16:20.434
You ruined his life.

1172
01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:21.869
You ruined my life.

1173
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.405
You're not my daughter.

1174
01:16:26.173 --> 01:16:28.008
How do you know?

1175
01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:30.044
How do you know
what's real,


1176
01:16:30.077 --> 01:16:31.312
what's not?

1177
01:16:31.345 --> 01:16:32.479
You can't even tell.

1178
01:16:35.482 --> 01:16:37.318
You don't know.

1179
01:16:37.351 --> 01:16:39.186
You don't know who I am.

1180
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.988
You were never around.

1181
01:16:41.021 --> 01:16:42.389
Do you even know me?

1182
01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:44.091
Do you know her at all?

1183
01:16:44.124 --> 01:16:46.193
You had a daughter.

1184
01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:48.262
You had a husband.

1185
01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:52.199
And all you ever cared about
was writing your book.


1186
01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:54.935
You paint your daughter
like this angel?


1187
01:16:54.969 --> 01:16:56.470
Your daughter
never loved you.


1188
01:16:58.005 --> 01:17:00.941
You never looked
after her.


1189
01:17:00.975 --> 01:17:06.380
She was wasting away,
while you wrote your book.


1190
01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:08.415
I'm not your daughter.

1191
01:17:08.449 --> 01:17:10.351
You're not --
You're not my daughter.


1192
01:17:11.552 --> 01:17:14.388
You're not my daughter.

1193
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.557
Evie.

1194
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:17.858
Evie!

1195
01:17:17.891 --> 01:17:19.193
Evie!

1196
01:17:19.226 --> 01:17:20.995
Are you okay?

1197
01:17:21.028 --> 01:17:23.197
Hey!

1198
01:17:23.230 --> 01:17:24.431
We got a job to do.

1199
01:17:24.465 --> 01:17:26.467
The lady's waiting
for us up there.


1200
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.401
Come on.

1201
01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.508
Evie, Evie.

1202
01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:37.544
We got to get
to the hospital.


1203
01:18:16.517 --> 01:18:17.384
Well?

1204
01:18:20.254 --> 01:18:21.121
Well, what?

1205
01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:26.093
There's a reason
we take photographs.


1206
01:18:26.126 --> 01:18:28.329
I had to see her.

1207
01:18:28.362 --> 01:18:30.064
You could've seen her
tomorrow at the
funeral home,


1208
01:18:30.097 --> 01:18:31.298
all done up and pretty.

1209
01:18:32.366 --> 01:18:34.068
Okay, file a complaint.

1210
01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:35.336
I don't care.

1211
01:18:35.369 --> 01:18:36.537
I got a long day
ahead of me,


1212
01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:38.005
working underpaid
for the state,


1213
01:18:38.038 --> 01:18:39.606
examining actual victims --

1214
01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:41.275
rape, domestic battery.

1215
01:18:41.308 --> 01:18:42.943
I had a kid this week.

1216
01:18:42.976 --> 01:18:44.211
Now, I get shit
like this?


1217
01:18:45.612 --> 01:18:47.649
Shit like what?

1218
01:18:47.682 --> 01:18:49.049
Suicide.

1219
01:18:49.083 --> 01:18:50.918
But the state needs proof.

1220
01:18:50.951 --> 01:18:52.486
Here.

1221
01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:53.954
This bone right there
would've been broken,


1222
01:18:53.987 --> 01:18:54.955
if she was strangled.

1223
01:18:54.988 --> 01:18:56.658
95% probability.

1224
01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:58.660
Now, I got to process it.

1225
01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:01.495
This is your tax dollars
at work.


1226
01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:02.996
She ain't even worth
opening up.


1227
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.028
I was there.

1228
01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:36.497
Man, I don't need
a sad story.


1229
01:19:49.543 --> 01:19:50.377
Thank you.

1230
01:20:04.024 --> 01:20:04.692
'Sup?

1231
01:20:09.731 --> 01:20:10.665
I'll scream.

1232
01:20:12.366 --> 01:20:14.034
She saved your life.

1233
01:20:14.067 --> 01:20:16.270
Don't waste it
on little ol' me.


1234
01:20:22.142 --> 01:20:26.313
Yeah, we can definitely
have fun together.


1235
01:20:26.346 --> 01:20:27.347
Offer's still
on the table.


1236
01:20:27.381 --> 01:20:28.282
What do you want?!

1237
01:20:39.159 --> 01:20:40.260
We're not evil.

1238
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.534
Tsk.

1239
01:20:47.568 --> 01:20:49.369
She'd want you
to have that.


1240
01:20:49.403 --> 01:20:52.206
What makes you think
you know what she wants?


1241
01:20:52.239 --> 01:20:56.210
She wrote her masterpiece
because of me.


1242
01:20:57.244 --> 01:20:58.445
Because of Karlov.

1243
01:21:01.114 --> 01:21:03.317
What did you give her?

1244
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:05.152
I saved her daughter.

1245
01:21:09.289 --> 01:21:11.124
She was dead when we met.

1246
01:21:12.627 --> 01:21:16.129
Is that what this is for,
this check,


1247
01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:17.799
to try to keep me quiet?!

1248
01:21:17.832 --> 01:21:20.534
You better believe
it's not going to happen.


1249
01:21:20.567 --> 01:21:24.238
And you best believe
I'm going to tell everyone!


1250
01:21:24.271 --> 01:21:26.306
How many people have you
and Karlov killed?


1251
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.742
How many?!

1252
01:21:27.775 --> 01:21:30.143
They kill themselves.

1253
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:31.813
You heard your friend
over there.


1254
01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:37.117
If you want to spend
the rest of your life


1255
01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:40.087
decorating a padded wall,

1256
01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.489
go ahead,
tell the world about us.


1257
01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:44.591
With all your evidence,

1258
01:21:44.626 --> 01:21:46.728
with all our money,

1259
01:21:46.761 --> 01:21:47.829
see how far you get.

1260
01:21:54.167 --> 01:21:56.403
You're boring me.

1261
01:21:56.436 --> 01:21:57.604
Offer's off the table.

1262
01:22:16.256 --> 01:22:17.825
Wow!

1263
01:22:17.859 --> 01:22:20.327
It's so beautiful here!

1264
01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.261
Yeah.

1265
01:25:52.506 --> 01:25:54.909
You know exactly who this is.

1266
01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:57.912
I want you to know
that I'm back in town


1267
01:25:57.945 --> 01:26:00.715
and that I've been able to think
over these past few weeks.


1268
01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:03.718
And you're right.

1269
01:26:05.485 --> 01:26:07.320
I don't need to involve
the police.


1270
01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:12.860
Nor do I need to tell the
whole world about this town.


1271
01:26:12.894 --> 01:26:15.362
But I want you to know
how excited I am...


1272
01:26:17.899 --> 01:26:19.332
...to know that you're
still here.


1273
01:26:21.035 --> 01:26:22.069
And I want you to know...

1274
01:26:23.838 --> 01:26:25.305
...that I'm coming
for you...


1275
01:26:26.841 --> 01:26:27.809
...Karlov....

1276
01:26:29.509 --> 01:26:34.015
...and anyone who else had
a part in my wife's death.


1277
01:26:34.048 --> 01:26:37.084
This will never,
ever happen to anyone else.


1278
01:26:37.118 --> 01:26:38.052
I'm coming for you.
