00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:10.577
<i>In WWl, for the first time ever,</i>

2
00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:15.698
<i>nations combined to fjght nations,
using the crude weapons of the day.</i>


3
00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:22.336
<i>WWll involved every continent.
Science provided new tools of war.</i>


4
00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:26.492
<i>These reached an unparalleled peak
in their capacity for destruction.</i>


5
00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:29.886
<i>Now, fought with the
terrible weapons of super-science,</i>


6
00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.078
<i>menacing every creature
on Earth, comes...</i>


7
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.256
<i>No one would have believed,
in the middle of the 20th century,</i>


8
00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:47.004
<i>human affairs were being closely
watched by a greater intelligence.</i>


9
00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:51.644
<i>Yet, across the gulf of space,
on the planet Mars,</i>


10
00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:57.518
<i>intellects vast and unsympathetic
regarded our Earth enviously,</i>


11
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:02.029
<i>slowly and surely
drawing their plans against us.</i>


12
00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:05.828
<i>Mars is more than 140 million miles
from the sun.</i>


13
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.988
<i>For centuries it has been
in the last stages of exhaustion.</i>


14
00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:15.621
<i>At night, temperatures drop
far below zero, even at its equator.</i>


15
00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:20.528
<i>The inhabitants of this dying planet
looked across space with instruments</i>


16
00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:23.250
<i>of which
we have scarcely dreamed,</i>


17
00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:27.410
<i>searching for another world
to which they could migrate.</i>


18
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:30.759
<i>They could not go to Pluto,
outermost of all planets,</i>


19
00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:36.276
<i>and so cold that its atmosphere
lies frozen on its surface.</i>


20
00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:42.426
<i>They couldn't use Neptune or Uranus,
twin worlds in eternal night,</i>


21
00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:47.625
<i>both surrounded by an atmosphere
of methane gas and ammonia vapour.</i>


22
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.021
<i>They considered Saturn, attractive
with its moons and rings,</i>


23
00:02:56.223 --> 00:03:01.496
<i>but its temperature is
close to 270 degrees below zero,</i>


24
00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:06.005
<i>and ice lies 15,000 miles deep
on its surface.</i>


25
00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:11.328
<i>Their nearest world was Jupiter,
with giant cliffs of lava and ice,</i>


26
00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:14.039
<i>with hydrogen flaming at the tops.</i>

27
00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:19.518
<i>The atmosphere is awful. Thousands
of pounds to the square inch.</i>


28
00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.549
<i>They couldn't go there, nor to Mercury,
nearest planet to the sun.</i>


29
00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:30.983
<i>It has no air. The temperature at
its equator is that of molten lead.</i>


30
00:03:31.188 --> 00:03:36.734
<i>Of all the worlds the life forms
on Mars could see and study,</i>


31
00:03:36.942 --> 00:03:43.011
<i>only our own Earth was green
with vegetation, bright with water,</i>


32
00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:48.409
<i>and possessed a cloudy atmosphere
eloquent of fertility.</i>


33
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.157
<i>It did not occur to mankind that a
swift fate might be hanging over us.</i>


34
00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:59.355
<i>Or that from the blackness of outer
space we were being scrutinised.</i>


35
00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:03.912
<i>Till the time we drew close to Mars'
orbit, during a pleasant summer...</i>


36
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:21.572
- Is that a fireball or something?
- Boy, that's big


37
00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:26.720
(EXPLOSION SOUNDS)

38
00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:32.047
- I wonder where it hit?
- Probably halfway to Pomona


39
00:04:32.247 --> 00:04:34.360
I'm gonna see Who's coming?

40
00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:37.553
This is Pine Summit I got a smoke

41
00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:42.466
- 160/30
- Azimuth: 160 degrees, 30 minutes


42
00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:47.868
Big? I bet it's as big as anything
that ever lit in California


43
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:52.026
Better get something over there
It's started a blaze already


44
00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.623
Number Three to DO

45
00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:37.736
<i>- D.O. to Number Three, come in.
- We're getting this under control</i>


46
00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:42.726
<i>Okay, send the tanker in, but you
stand by until that thing cools off.</i>


47
00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:48.607
<i>- Someone ought to check on it
- There's scientists fishing nearby.</i>


48
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.276
<i>They probably saw it come down.
I'll tell them. What's it look like?</i>


49
00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:58.399
It's too hot to get near enough
for a good look, but it's enormous


50
00:06:06.592 --> 00:06:11.786
I got a message for you You're the
guys from Pacific Tech, ain't you?


51
00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:16.733
- Looks like the fishing was good
- Have some?


52
00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:19.453
Well, I might just do that

53
00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:23.650
It's about that meteor

54
00:06:24.654 --> 00:06:26.802
They say it's a whopper

55
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.516
They phoned us up on the summit
I thought you might be interested


56
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:38.475
- About 10 miles from here
- It didn't come down like a meteor


57
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.953
That's right
It came down in spurts


58
00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:46.389
<i>You fellows figure it out
You're scientists</i>


59
00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:49.183
It's big as a house and red-hot

60
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.495
- I'll borrow your car and take a look
- We ought to get back


61
00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:58.092
- I'll fly Bilder back down in your plane
- Okay, the insurance is paid up


62
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.448
- Light?
- No, I'll smoke it later


63
00:07:16.122 --> 00:07:19.907
Did you watch it come down?
I saw it from my window


64
00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:24.748
Harold, look here a minute

65
00:07:24.954 --> 00:07:28.545
Step over a little Smile

66
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.978
It must have skidded along the gully

67
00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:35.858
Then the loose earth
shook down over it


68
00:07:36.063 --> 00:07:39.654
- I guess most of it's buried
- That's 12 feet thick


69
00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:44.211
They run heavy They won't be able
to haul this one away to no museum


70
00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:47.640
A good attraction for Sunday drivers

71
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.405
Better than a lion farm or
snake pit We won't have to feed it


72
00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:56.720
- We can sell tamales and hot dogs
- Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs


73
00:07:56.922 --> 00:08:01.388
- We should put up picnic tables
- Then they'd bring their own lunch


74
00:08:03.036 --> 00:08:07.229
- Gonna dig for gold, Buck?
- You think you're kidding?


75
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:11.784
It'll be like having a gold mine
in your own back yard


76
00:08:11.987 --> 00:08:14.418
I'm gonna get a closer look at it

77
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.284
- That's it over there
- It's still pretty darned hot


78
00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:36.915
- Be careful, Buck
- Watch it


79
00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:45.669
- Did you see it come down?
- Yes, I was fishing in the hills


80
00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:50.896
- That's a lot of tackle
- The others flew back in my plane


81
00:08:52.106 --> 00:08:54.698
Why didn't it make a bigger crater?

82
00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:59.848
It hit sideways and skidded in
That's what I think


83
00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:03.525
A scientist's coming, he'll tell us

84
00:09:03.735 --> 00:09:07.849
- Ever hear of Clayton Forrester?
- What's that fellow trying to do?


85
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.756
<i>He's top man in astro and nuclear
physics He knows all about meteors</i>


86
00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:18.830
- You seem to know all about him
- I did a thesis on modern scientists


87
00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:23.028
- Did it do you any good?
- Sure, I got my degree


88
00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:27.428
- Say, do you have a match?
- No, I'm sorry I don't smoke


89
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.573
They had Forrester on the cover of
Time You have to rate to get that


90
00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:38.136
- He isn't that good
- You don't even know him!


91
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.090
- I do know him, slightly
- What's he like?


92
00:09:42.296 --> 00:09:44.444
Well, he's like

93
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:55.322
You don't look like yourself in that
get-up, but I'm happy to meet you


94
00:09:55.523 --> 00:09:58.592
Sylvia Van Buren
I teach library science at USC


95
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.426
- I didn't know how to stop you
- You didn't wear glasses in Time


96
00:10:04.634 --> 00:10:09.384
They're for long distance To look
at something close, I take them off


97
00:10:24.334 --> 00:10:29.357
- You could fry eggs on that thing
- The sand is keeping the heat in


98
00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:34.877
Uncle, Dr Forrester Dr Matthew
Collins is the pastor here


99
00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:38.550
- Well, how do you do?
- How do you do, sir?


100
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.669
Hey, you!

101
00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:50.424
What have you got in here?
It's ticking like a bomb


102
00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:58.931
This is a Geiger counter
for detecting radioactivity


103
00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:13.083
- It's that meteor
- It's radioactive?


104
00:11:13.285 --> 00:11:16.990
Yes It's difficult to account
for a reaction like that


105
00:11:22.076 --> 00:11:27.464
- Look at it It's going crazy!
- Maybe we should keep people away


106
00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:30.421
I'll post a few deputies

107
00:11:32.306 --> 00:11:36.931
That meteor is either very light,
which is unheard of, or it's hollow


108
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:42.210
If it were heavy and solid, it would
have made a tremendous crater


109
00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:48.246
I'll wait around until it cools off
Is there a place I could clean up?


110
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.485
- I'd like you to stay at my house
- Thank you


111
00:11:52.686 --> 00:11:57.471
It won't be cool for 24 hours What
do people do here on a Saturday?


112
00:11:57.681 --> 00:12:01.636
- Not much of anything
- There's a square dance tonight


113
00:12:03.475 --> 00:12:06.703
Allemande left and the ladies star
Gents walk around, but not too far


114
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:11.980
Allemande left and the gentlemen star
Ladies walk around, but not too far


115
00:12:12.186 --> 00:12:16.300
First and third balance and swing
Promenade the outside ring


116
00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:20.491
Three quarters round the outside ring
Through that couple and not too far


117
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:24.733
Meet in the centre with right hand star
Swing your corner with left hand round


118
00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:35.678
Let's take another look at it

119
00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:05.127
- It's almost cold now
- We might as well go home


120
00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:08.878
- No sense staying out here
- Let's go


121
00:13:14.284 --> 00:13:16.716
Hey, it's moving!

122
00:13:33.824 --> 00:13:37.496
- It's a bomb!
- It didn't go off last night


123
00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:41.974
- Maybe it's gonna go off now
- It's a sneak attack Let's go


124
00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:44.085
Wait a minute

125
00:13:46.052 --> 00:13:48.280
Bombs don't unscrew

126
00:13:49.289 --> 00:13:52.198
It's no meteor That's for sure

127
00:13:53.804 --> 00:13:58.191
Darnedest thing I ever saw,
the way that's unscrewing


128
00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:12.226
- Thank you, Doctor Having fun?
- You know what I was thinking?


129
00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:18.131
The energy from one square dance
could send the meteor back home


130
00:15:03.814 --> 00:15:09.281
- Must be somebody in there
- Who? Where do they come from?


131
00:15:09.489 --> 00:15:15.319
I read that Mars is near Earth now
It happens every 20 years, they say


132
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.150
Men from Mars

133
00:15:18.799 --> 00:15:23.346
- What do you think?
- Maybe these are not men, like us


134
00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:27.066
Everything human doesn't
have to look like you and me


135
00:15:30.947 --> 00:15:34.856
If it's men from Mars, we ought to
let them know we're friendly


136
00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:40.416
- No, you don't know what it is
- We'd be the first to make contact


137
00:15:40.617 --> 00:15:43.890
We'd be in all the papers

138
00:15:44.094 --> 00:15:47.969
We could walk out there
with a white flag


139
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.965
I got an old
sugar sack in my car

140
00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:02.069
What are we going to say to them?

141
00:16:03.714 --> 00:16:06.385
"Welcome to California"

142
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.342
Come on

143
00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:15.261
(PULSATING ELECTRONIC NOISE)

- The phone isn't on the same circuit

wrong with my hearing aid

They've all stopped
at the same time

thing like this Do you have a pin?

See that? My watch is magnetised

162
00:18:45.393 --> 00:18:47.426
That's what
knocked the phones out, too

- Do you have a pocket compass?

they're from some other planet

they look like? Bigger? Smaller?</i>

would oppress them.</i>

quite different from ours.</i>

themselves out There it comes again!

00:57:13.922 --> 00:57:17.547
Sunlight on Mars is approximately
half as strong as we get it


436
00:57:17.758 --> 00:57:22.269
Add their clouds and dust,
it amounts to no more than our twilight


437
00:57:24.032 --> 00:57:27.225
Now, if you'll step over here, please

438
00:57:27.428 --> 00:57:32.258
We've rigged the epidiascope to reflect
whatever the Martian lens picks up


439
00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.410
Move in a little Thank you

440
00:58:09.866 --> 00:58:12.935
There's how the Martians see us

441
00:58:24.211 --> 00:58:27.200
Evidently there's a shift
in their spectrum


442
00:58:29.166 --> 00:58:32.712
Their colour absorption
must be different from ours


443
00:58:38.157 --> 00:58:42.226
Let's see why they were so curious
about you, Miss Van Buren


444
00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:53.410
- Time we got started, gentlemen
- Let's go


445
00:58:56.259 --> 00:59:01.931
- Let's make an analysis of their blood
- It might give us something


446
00:59:02.133 --> 00:59:07.566
You can get all the Martian blood you
want after the plane drops the bomb


447
00:59:08.647 --> 00:59:11.317
The Flying Wing is going to carry it

448
00:59:20.235 --> 00:59:23.941
Tower, this is Flying Wing,
ready for take-off


449
00:59:24.151 --> 00:59:27.538
<i>Flying Wing, this is the tower.
Clear for take-off.</i>


450
00:59:27.748 --> 00:59:29.816
Wish us luck

451
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:59.794
The target is the nest of
Martian machines in the Puente Hills,


452
00:59:59.995 --> 01:00:03.746
where more cylinders came down
last evening


453
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:07.384
A plane will pinpoint the target
from six miles up


454
01:00:07.588 --> 01:00:12.657
This bomb is ten times more powerful
than anything previously used


455
01:00:12.863 --> 01:00:15.010
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission

456
01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:19.892
Nothing like it has ever been exploded
before We're going to be pretty close,


457
01:00:20.095 --> 01:00:25.403
but there are observers in a forward
bunker who will be a lot nearer than us


458
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:32.441
The whole world is waiting
This will decide the fate of civilisation


459
01:00:32.643 --> 01:00:36.188
Whether we live or die
may depend on what happens here


460
01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:40.832
<i>Attention! Four minutes to bomb time.</i>

461
01:00:42.073 --> 01:00:46.460
There must be a couple of million
people behind us in the hills,


462
01:00:46.669 --> 01:00:50.817
waiting to find out
whether they can go home again


463
01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:54.417
All around the world, people
have been driven from their homes


464
01:00:54.621 --> 01:00:57.973
Direct cable communication
is being maintained with Washington,


465
01:00:58.177 --> 01:01:03.610
but there's no radio at all Not even
with the bomber that's coming over


466
01:01:03.812 --> 01:01:06.846
All radio is dead,

467
01:01:07.048 --> 01:01:13.481
which means that these recordings
are for the sake of future history, if any


468
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.312
Future history, he said

469
01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.508
Yes, if any

470
01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:34.975
Bilderbeck's calculated how long
we have until they take over the world


471
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:41.522
If the A-bomb fails, the Martians
can conquer Earth in six days


472
01:01:42.213 --> 01:01:44.520
The same number of days
it took to create it


473
01:01:51.284 --> 01:01:56.672
<i>Attention! Two minutes to bomb time.
Prepare to take shelter.</i>

<i>If you have no goggles, turn away.</i>

475

concussion that follow are dangerous.</i>

Hello? What can you see?

487
01:03:50.485 --> 01:03:51.678
There's something moving!

488
01:04:02.712 --> 01:04:04.588
They haven't even been touched!

489
01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:19.724
It didn't stop them Guns, tanks, bombs,
they're like toys against them!


490
01:04:19.935 --> 01:04:23.402
It'll end only one way
We're beaten

No Not yet

492
01:04:30.405 --> 01:04:34.553
Washington ordered all cities in danger
of attack evacuated if the bomb fails


493
01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:40.273
They'll be moving on Los Angeles now
We'll fight them back to the mountains


494
01:04:41.953 --> 01:04:45.579
Our best hope lies in what you people
can develop to help us


495

Six days, you said Six days

496
01:04:53.102 --> 01:04:55.738
They'll stamp the city flat

497
01:04:58.816 --> 01:05:02.567
We'll establish a base laboratory
in the Rocky Mountains


498
01:05:02.772 --> 01:05:06.398
- We'll search out their weaknesses
