00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:23.947
Inspired by a certain era, the story,
events and characters in this film are fictional.


2
00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:25.988
Any resemblance to real life people,
names or events is coincidental.


3
00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:49.511
Well... It was about time!

4
00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.870
What's your emergency?

5
00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:01.227
I need to talk
to you about something else.

6
00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:03.434
About what?

7
00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:09.829
We got a strange request.

8
00:01:09.997 --> 00:01:11.874
What kind of request?

9
00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:14.950
From the police in Estonia. Tallinn.

10
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:18.109
They have captured someone.

11
00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:21.434
You.

12
00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:23.233
What?

13
00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:28.471
Some criminal is probably using your identity.

14
00:01:32.037 --> 00:01:33.835
Wait here,

15
00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:36.830
This is the third time

16
00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.635
you called about this poop.

17
00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.232
Exactly my point!

18
00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:48.069
Listen up. Do it
in front of our house!

19
00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:50.871
Understand?

20
00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:01.192
My name is Ralf Tamm. 47 years old,

21
00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:04.110
Swedish citizen, small business owner.

22
00:02:04.277 --> 00:02:05.915
A decent taxpayer.

23
00:02:12.477 --> 00:02:14.548
But this has not always been the case.

24
00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:18.631
30 years ago, when all this started,

25
00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:20.788
I lived in another world.

26
00:02:25.117 --> 00:02:28.826
That lost world has reminded itself now.

27
00:02:32.637 --> 00:02:34.674
Tallinn, Soviet Estonia,

28
00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:37.666
There was yet no corrosion

29
00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:39.635
on the Iron Curtain,

30
00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:40.753
The borders were closed,

31
00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:42.351
there was war in Afghanistan.

32
00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:44.793
People were marching

33
00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:47.267
towards a bright communist future.

34
00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:49.713
In reality something else

35
00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:50.992
made peaple move.

36
00:02:51.157 --> 00:02:53.831
We did not have
even the most basic things.

37
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:56.147
Skilful people sewed their own clothes,

38
00:02:56.317 --> 00:02:58.991
the rest walked around in baggy sweats

39
00:02:59.157 --> 00:03:00.670
and wore unmatching rubber boots.

40
00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:04.671
This was our opportunity.

41
00:03:06.397 --> 00:03:10.994
THE DISSIDENTS

42
00:03:14.637 --> 00:03:16.708
This is me.

43
00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:18.550
And this is Mario Vik,

44
00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:20.993
nicknamed Speculator. 
My best friend.

45
00:03:21.997 --> 00:03:24.273
Though he was not
from the best of families.

46
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:29.068
He and his brother found Finnish tourists,

47
00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:31.513
who brought Western goods,

48
00:03:32.557 --> 00:03:34.150
Jarmo.

49
00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:37.917
KGB? 
- Friends.

50
00:03:41.077 --> 00:03:43.546
Jeans, tights, cigarettes,

51
00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:45.469
chewing gum, even plastic bags.

52
00:03:45.637 --> 00:03:46.957
Everything was hard currency back then.

53
00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:50.826
That's a good brand. 
- Sneakers?

54
00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.113
There was a mix-up...

55
00:03:53.277 --> 00:03:55.587
My wife packed ski boots.

56
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.467
Ski boots? It's almost summer.

57
00:04:13.037 --> 00:04:16.553
This profiteering was against the law.

58
00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:17.866
Soviet citizens

59
00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:21.507
were not even allowed in the hotel.

60
00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.830
But we came prepared.

61
00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:30.353
[In Finnish] Jyrkki. Look,

62
00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:33.430
Do I have dust in my eye?

63
00:04:35.877 --> 00:04:37.106
Look.

64
00:04:39.357 --> 00:04:42.315
Well? 
- Yes.

65
00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:47.075
Yes, Matti. 
- God damn it.

66
00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:51.108
Bye bye, buddy.

67
00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:55.430
A little bit of adrenalin,

68
00:04:55.597 --> 00:04:56.871
a smile at the right moment,

69
00:04:57.037 --> 00:04:59.950
some boldness and a lot of charm.

70
00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:01.949
This job suited us.

71
00:05:02.117 --> 00:05:03.630
We had our system

72
00:05:03.797 --> 00:05:05.913
and could work in the lion's cage.

73
00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:08.107
Thanks, Silvi.

74
00:05:08.277 --> 00:05:09.790
It was hard doing something better

75
00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:13.029
or more profitable back then.

76
00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:18.472
Amateur,

77
00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:26.229
Hey, you crooks. All good?

78
00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:28.229
Einar Kotkin. Meathead.

79
00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:30.715
His biggest idol was Rambo.

80
00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:32.948
But his dad was a Soviet veteran,

81
00:05:33.117 --> 00:05:33.913
who trained him to survive

82
00:05:34.077 --> 00:05:35.397
the nuclear winter.

83
00:05:35.997 --> 00:05:39.353
The main thing was
his parents had a Lada,

84
00:05:40.197 --> 00:05:41.756
Hey, don't!

85
00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:56.706
The next step.

86
00:05:56.877 --> 00:05:58.026
The buyers waited for us

87
00:05:58.197 --> 00:06:00.029
at a secret location.

88
00:06:00.197 --> 00:06:02.393
It was a well-oiled machine.

89
00:06:04.157 --> 00:06:05.386
No sneakers?

90
00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:13.707
You can saw off the tops.

91
00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:15.991
Cool hoofs.

92
00:06:16.157 --> 00:06:17.830
The latest trend.

93
00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:19.351
A hundred percent synthetics.

94
00:06:19.517 --> 00:06:22.396
A bit tough. 
- Karhu brand is tough.

95
00:06:22.557 --> 00:06:23.672
Tough as hell.

96
00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.627
Sometimes we had small problems.

97
00:06:26.797 --> 00:06:29.152
Hey. 
- Then some more oil was needed.

98
00:06:29.317 --> 00:06:30.546
Look at this, podiatrists.

99
00:06:36.677 --> 00:06:37.872
The free world.

100
00:06:39.277 --> 00:06:40.950
Jackpot, guys.

101
00:06:41.877 --> 00:06:43.197
Jackpot.

102
00:06:44.197 --> 00:06:45.870
All this Western stuff

103
00:06:46.037 --> 00:06:48.870
was literally worth gold.

104
00:06:50.837 --> 00:06:52.032
We didn't say no to anything

105
00:06:52.197 --> 00:06:54.108
we could exchange for money.

106
00:06:54.277 --> 00:06:56.791
Jackpot, guys. Jackpot.

107
00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:58.996
The last step.

108
00:06:59.157 --> 00:07:00.750
Changing gold for money.

109
00:07:02.237 --> 00:07:04.433
There was a buyer for everything

110
00:07:04.597 --> 00:07:07.794
and every day was payday.

111
00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:12.717
But our story begins here.

112
00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:16.636
I need to go to work... I need...

113
00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:18.788
Those spare parts are impossible to get...

114
00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:29.156
Lembit, be a man now!

115
00:07:54.477 --> 00:07:56.627
Hey, brother. A wake or a party?

116
00:07:56.797 --> 00:07:58.390
Oh it's a party.

117
00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:02.634
Listen up, cupcakes. 
We need to talk.

118
00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:12.471
The functionaries are on my back.

119
00:08:14.477 --> 00:08:16.593
Because of the draft? 
- No. That's piss.

120
00:08:17.277 --> 00:08:19.075
Our guys beat up a militiaman.

121
00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:21.911
Turns out his dad is an important official.

122
00:08:22.077 --> 00:08:24.307
Our business is done here.

123
00:08:26.277 --> 00:08:30.157
But... We are escaping to Sweden.

124
00:08:30.317 --> 00:08:33.116
Through Finland. 
We got a boat.

125
00:08:33.277 --> 00:08:35.268
No more waiting.

126
00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:37.667
You are coming with us, brother,

127
00:08:37.837 --> 00:08:39.510
Lets get out of this Pig-land.

128
00:08:45.077 --> 00:08:46.715
Your grandfather is in Sweden.

129
00:08:47.477 --> 00:08:48.751
I haven't heard from him in ages.

130
00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:51.033
We need a contact over there.

131
00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.107
We cannot stay in Finland,

132
00:08:52.277 --> 00:08:53.312
they'll extradict us.

133
00:08:53.477 --> 00:08:55.036
I have no contact with him.

134
00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:56.870
He fled during the war.

135
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.426
My mom is too
afraid to talk about him.

136
00:08:59.597 --> 00:09:00.587
Too bad.

137
00:09:02.677 --> 00:09:05.556
Alright, we'll meet up at my place

138
00:09:05.717 --> 00:09:07.435
to discuss the details.

139
00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:10.235
Later, cupcakes.

140
00:09:15.677 --> 00:09:18.237
So? That's your plan?

141
00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:19.114
You didn't mention it to us.

142
00:09:19.277 --> 00:09:20.631
Go abroad with your brother's gang

143
00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:22.276
and leave us behind.

144
00:09:34.837 --> 00:09:36.669
Hey, babes!

145
00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.715
Can you smell the hard currency?

146
00:09:39.877 --> 00:09:40.867
Come on,

147
00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:44.792
Here you go.

148
00:09:44.957 --> 00:09:46.675
Don't be afraid.

149
00:10:04.677 --> 00:10:06.076
Rita.

150
00:10:07.317 --> 00:10:11.709
[In Russian] Damn, 
I forgot the workbook.

151
00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:13.709
Ralf, I'm pregnant.

152
00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:19.349
I'll go get it now...

153
00:10:19.517 --> 00:10:21.633
Wait, that's not important.

154
00:10:21.797 --> 00:10:24.596
I'm expecting a child. We are.

155
00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:27.033
We are going to have a baby. Understand?

156
00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:29.427
Don't worry, I thought about everything.

157
00:10:29.597 --> 00:10:30.348
We need a stroller.

158
00:10:30.517 --> 00:10:31.837
My aunt knows people.

159
00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:33.112
Maybe she'll get even a Czech one.

160
00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:35.348
The one you can hang rattles on.

161
00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:38.628
I'll make the diapers myself.

162
00:10:38.797 --> 00:10:42.233
We need an apartment. 
Dad will kick me out.

163
00:10:42.397 --> 00:10:43.671
But we'll manage.

164
00:10:43.837 --> 00:10:47.910
We'll get married, get jobs.

165
00:10:48.077 --> 00:10:50.193
The government will give us an apartment.

166
00:10:50.357 --> 00:10:52.234
Everything will be fine.

167
00:10:52.397 --> 00:10:54.707
Ralf? Are you listening?

168
00:11:30.597 --> 00:11:33.794
Dad waited for your call.

169
00:11:33.957 --> 00:11:35.914
Yeah.

170
00:11:36.077 --> 00:11:37.431
Rita came looking for you.

171
00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:40.310
Yes,

172
00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:44.072
Ralf, I want you to think about this.

173
00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:48.068
The first semester is over soon.

174
00:11:48.237 --> 00:11:49.989
I want you to have a proper job.

175
00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:51.306
Like dad?

176
00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.036
He's been gone for six months.

177
00:11:53.197 --> 00:11:55.074
Ralf, do not be ungrateful.

178
00:11:56.197 --> 00:11:58.188
Tam not. It's just...

179
00:11:58.357 --> 00:11:59.028
I won't remember his face by the time

180
00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:01.074
he earns enough to buy a Lada car.

181
00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:03.672
I don't want you to be an opportunist

182
00:12:03.837 --> 00:12:05.475
who ends up in jail.

183
00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:07.196
Don't worry about me.

184
00:12:07.357 --> 00:12:10.156
I'll manage. All is good.

185
00:12:16.717 --> 00:12:19.027
Do you want me to help?

186
00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.393
No thanks, I'll manage.

187
00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:25.986
I don't believe you.

188
00:12:26.157 --> 00:12:28.626
Rare metals.

189
00:12:28.797 --> 00:12:30.470
Rare metals...

190
00:12:30.637 --> 00:12:32.867
Here you are.

191
00:12:33.037 --> 00:12:35.347
Yes. Iron oxide.

192
00:12:39.317 --> 00:12:40.830
Where is it?

193
00:12:54.917 --> 00:12:56.635
Meathead!

194
00:12:56.797 --> 00:12:58.276
Meathead! 
- What?

195
00:12:58.437 --> 00:13:01.031
You got soap instead of money?

196
00:13:03.037 --> 00:13:05.313
We are screwed without Mario,

197
00:13:05.477 --> 00:13:07.354
Totally screwed.

198
00:13:08.797 --> 00:13:11.835
They have pills in the West.

199
00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:13.670
Steroids.

200
00:13:13.837 --> 00:13:15.555
Body lotions.

201
00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:17.469
I have to do everything myself

202
00:13:17.637 --> 00:13:20.311
like a fucking Belarus tractor.

203
00:13:20.477 --> 00:13:22.627
You can get feed from the collective farm.

204
00:13:22.797 --> 00:13:24.515
Does it work on people? 
- Yes.

205
00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:25.587
It makes your udders grow too.

206
00:13:25.757 --> 00:13:27.873
You can milk yourself. 
- I am serious.

207
00:13:32.797 --> 00:13:35.630
Mario. 
- The militia took my brother.

208
00:13:35.797 --> 00:13:37.356
No way. 
- They arrested the whole gang.

209
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:38.951
All of them.

210
00:13:41.597 --> 00:13:43.190
First - an investigation.

211
00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:46.793
Then to the army, away for two years.

212
00:13:46.957 --> 00:13:48.391
We thought you'd be in Sweden by now.

213
00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:49.831
We were supposed to go tonight.

214
00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:53.710
What now?

215
00:13:57.557 --> 00:13:59.389
I'll tell you what.

216
00:14:01.277 --> 00:14:05.271
We take the boat and go ourselves.

217
00:14:07.357 --> 00:14:09.155
My brother has money waiting in Finland.

218
00:14:09.317 --> 00:14:11.069
That will get us started.

219
00:14:11.237 --> 00:14:13.467
He will follow us later.

220
00:14:13.637 --> 00:14:15.071
Are you serious? 
- Yes,

221
00:14:15.237 --> 00:14:16.910
Our business in hotel Viru is over,

222
00:14:17.637 --> 00:14:20.834
Even if we did really well,

223
00:14:20.997 --> 00:14:22.226
ten years from now

224
00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:23.512
we'd sit in front of a shed,

225
00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:25.793
a crummy Lada in the driveway

226
00:14:25.957 --> 00:14:26.549
and listening

227
00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:27.991
to the party congress on the radio.

228
00:14:28.157 --> 00:14:29.716
This is it, guys.

229
00:14:29.877 --> 00:14:31.197
What's there to think about?

230
00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:33.348
My dad would flip out.

231
00:14:33.517 --> 00:14:36.111
Me joining the army is
a matter of honor for him.

232
00:14:36.277 --> 00:14:41.226
Mom said... Mom said we'd try to talk...

233
00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:43.593
You will talk about nothing.

234
00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:45.236
You will call him from Sweden.

235
00:14:45.397 --> 00:14:48.469
Let him yell his side cap straight.

236
00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:49.752
And if we get caught?

237
00:14:49.917 --> 00:14:50.987
They will shoot us.

238
00:14:54.357 --> 00:14:56.314
Then stay here.

239
00:14:56.477 --> 00:14:58.946
We'll send you some
Jenkki chewing gum to Afghanistan.

240
00:14:59.117 --> 00:15:00.755
You can blow a bubble

241
00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:03.033
while the ragheads cut your head off.

242
00:15:07.237 --> 00:15:08.386
Alright.

243
00:15:09.197 --> 00:15:11.950
Alright!

244
00:15:12.797 --> 00:15:14.117
Let's do this! 
- Alright!

245
00:15:14.277 --> 00:15:17.235
It's decided. 
- Lets do this!

246
00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:26.428
Are you kidding?

247
00:15:26.597 --> 00:15:28.952
No. That's how it is.

248
00:15:29.117 --> 00:15:31.028
How do you know the child is yours?

249
00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:32.835
Stop it.

250
00:15:32.997 --> 00:15:35.147
She said the same to her last boyfriend.

251
00:15:37.277 --> 00:15:39.234
I told you to stop.

252
00:15:40.677 --> 00:15:43.112
Ralf, listen to me.

253
00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:44.597
Rita wants you to take responsibility,

254
00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:48.546
because you are a gullible fool.

255
00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:52.428
Have you even slept with her?

256
00:15:53.357 --> 00:15:55.633
Have I slept with her? 
- Yes. Have you?

257
00:15:55.797 --> 00:15:57.708
What kind of a question is that?

258
00:15:57.877 --> 00:15:59.914
Maybe you too were found in a nutshell.

259
00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:01.272
The holy family.

260
00:16:01.437 --> 00:16:03.348
Mom a scientist, dad a working class hero.

261
00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:06.430
Am I right? Ralf.

262
00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:08.270
Huh? 
- Well...

263
00:16:10.357 --> 00:16:12.667
Ralf. Ralf,

264
00:16:16.557 --> 00:16:18.594
God damn it... 
- Hey, crooks.

265
00:16:20.117 --> 00:16:21.516
Let's be friends.

266
00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:27.835
I got you.

267
00:16:27.997 --> 00:16:30.068
Are we going to make up, huh?

268
00:16:30.237 --> 00:16:31.716
Let's make up.

269
00:17:44.757 --> 00:17:47.067
I'll present my dissertation tomorrow.

270
00:17:47.237 --> 00:17:50.150
I am awfully nervous.

271
00:17:50.317 --> 00:17:52.877
We could go somewhere after.

272
00:17:53.037 --> 00:17:54.789
Maybe to a cafeteria.

273
00:17:55.757 --> 00:17:57.509
What are you doing tomorrow, Ralf?

274
00:18:02.997 --> 00:18:03.828
Ralf?

275
00:18:11.437 --> 00:18:12.996
And?

276
00:18:20.997 --> 00:18:21.748
What the...

277
00:18:21.917 --> 00:18:23.430
Fucking bonehead.

278
00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:44.436
Let's go.

279
00:18:58.157 --> 00:19:00.068
Mario!

280
00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:23.627
Hey, crooks!

281
00:19:25.037 --> 00:19:26.436
Hey, crooks! Where are you?

282
00:19:26.597 --> 00:19:27.632
Meathead.

283
00:19:29.317 --> 00:19:30.352
I got away.

284
00:19:30.517 --> 00:19:32.394
Dad went to a party.

285
00:19:32.557 --> 00:19:33.752
I took his car.

286
00:19:33.917 --> 00:19:35.590
Why these?

287
00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:38.351
We have an excuse
in case we get caught.

288
00:19:38.517 --> 00:19:41.077
That we came here to play badminton?

289
00:19:41.237 --> 00:19:42.307
Come on now. Help me.

290
00:19:47.717 --> 00:19:49.037
What about the car?

291
00:19:49.197 --> 00:19:49.868
The state can have it.

292
00:19:50.037 --> 00:19:51.789
Or do you want
to take it with you

293
00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.152
along with your mom and summer house?

294
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.432
Fuck.

295
00:19:54.997 --> 00:19:56.829
Hey, guys.

296
00:19:56.997 --> 00:20:00.069
There is no way back.

297
00:20:00.237 --> 00:20:03.150
Oh, stop the drama, scientist.

298
00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:26.756
What's wrong?

299
00:20:26.917 --> 00:20:29.955
What does it want?! 
- It's cold.

300
00:20:30.117 --> 00:20:31.949
It's so cold. 
- It's supposed to be cold.

301
00:20:32.117 --> 00:20:34.393
We're fleeing through the Iron Curtain,

302
00:20:34.557 --> 00:20:36.594
I didn't know fleeing was this cold.

303
00:20:39.877 --> 00:20:41.470
I don't feel so good. 
- Hush.

304
00:20:49.437 --> 00:20:51.553
The border patrol is coming. 
- No.

305
00:20:51.717 --> 00:20:54.436
The dockers are starting their shift.

306
00:20:55.517 --> 00:20:56.837
Let me try.

307
00:20:59.957 --> 00:21:02.233
What is that? 
- Hands off.

308
00:21:04.837 --> 00:21:06.589
God damn idiot!

309
00:21:08.317 --> 00:21:09.955
I want to go home.

310
00:21:11.517 --> 00:21:13.667
I want to go home.

311
00:21:21.957 --> 00:21:24.471
Border guards are having a party.

312
00:21:25.157 --> 00:21:27.273
We started the party!

313
00:22:02.077 --> 00:22:04.637
The worst thing is, that I can't tell

314
00:22:04.797 --> 00:22:07.391
which way we are going.

315
00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:12.790
I would rather drown

316
00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:15.028
than be taken alive.

317
00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:18.754
Twill drown you myself.

318
00:22:41.757 --> 00:22:43.589
Hey, guys.

319
00:22:43.757 --> 00:22:44.633
Guys!

320
00:22:49.357 --> 00:22:50.586
Is that Finland?

321
00:22:50.757 --> 00:22:52.634
Are we back in Estonia?

322
00:22:52.797 --> 00:22:54.788
No, those are Finnish trees.

323
00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:57.392
Crooks, those are Western trees!

324
00:23:22.717 --> 00:23:24.708
Land of the chewing gum!

325
00:23:24.877 --> 00:23:27.756
Who are the bosses now?

326
00:23:27.917 --> 00:23:30.386
Why are you yelling?

327
00:23:30.557 --> 00:23:31.706
If they hear us,

328
00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:33.276
they'll call the Soviet embassy.

329
00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:34.711
Iam not afraid of anyone.

330
00:23:34.877 --> 00:23:35.992
Let's get my brother's money.

331
00:23:36.157 --> 00:23:38.387
Then straight to Sweden.

332
00:23:38.997 --> 00:23:40.795
You know what, Meathead?

333
00:23:40.957 --> 00:23:43.870
Here, instead of strawberries

334
00:23:44.037 --> 00:23:45.789
they have Jennki gum growing in the forests.

335
00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:48.517
Jenkki, Jenkki! 
- Shut up.

336
00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.270
Which direction?

337
00:23:50.437 --> 00:23:52.906
To the West,

338
00:23:53.077 --> 00:23:55.114
We should turn right.

339
00:23:55.277 --> 00:23:56.631
What? 
- Why right?

340
00:23:56.797 --> 00:23:58.117
Isn't West always on the right side?

341
00:23:58.277 --> 00:24:00.507
Your ass is on the right side.

342
00:24:43.557 --> 00:24:45.150
We are Finns, remember?

343
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.955
They'll know.

344
00:24:47.117 --> 00:24:48.232
I'll do the talking.

345
00:24:48.397 --> 00:24:51.913
No small-talk. Got it?

346
00:24:52.077 --> 00:24:53.670
Listen, maybe we don't have to eat?

347
00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:56.067
What? 
- We can eat berries and shrub.

348
00:24:56.237 --> 00:24:58.956
We are not plant lice.

349
00:25:00.877 --> 00:25:03.710
This summer has been particularly dry.

350
00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:06.995
Today is another dry and hot day.

351
00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:09.751
There is a forest fire warning

352
00:25:09.917 --> 00:25:12.033
that's been in force for three weeks now.

353
00:25:12.197 --> 00:25:14.996
The drought isn't going to end...

354
00:25:15.157 --> 00:25:16.272
Hello.

355
00:25:16.437 --> 00:25:19.953
We would like to have two pizzas.

356
00:25:20.117 --> 00:25:21.949
And Jaffa-lemonades.

357
00:25:22.117 --> 00:25:24.347
For each. Please.

358
00:25:30.797 --> 00:25:34.233
Did it start to rain outside?

359
00:25:34.397 --> 00:25:36.513
Yes, one small cloud

360
00:25:36.677 --> 00:25:38.111
came from the East.

361
00:25:38.277 --> 00:25:41.269
No problem. 
- Not at all.

362
00:25:45.997 --> 00:25:48.147
Fucking cube.

363
00:25:48.317 --> 00:25:50.035
Your Jaffa.

364
00:25:58.357 --> 00:25:59.916
And these. Here you are.

365
00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:07.554
What the hell is this?

366
00:26:07.717 --> 00:26:10.106
Italian food. Delicacy.

367
00:26:32.237 --> 00:26:33.875
It tastes like fried vomit.

368
00:26:35.397 --> 00:26:37.468
The mobsters eat this.

369
00:26:47.437 --> 00:26:49.872
We are not proper mobsters.

370
00:26:51.597 --> 00:26:52.996
Pass the paper.

371
00:27:00.117 --> 00:27:01.516
Ralf.

372
00:27:05.717 --> 00:27:08.357
At least we have taken
a dump in the free world.

373
00:27:16.157 --> 00:27:18.387
It will take some time.

374
00:27:19.357 --> 00:27:21.473
Your brother's money is invested in wood.

375
00:27:21.637 --> 00:27:22.957
What do you mean?

376
00:27:23.117 --> 00:27:26.030
The logs will be sold to Russia.

377
00:27:26.197 --> 00:27:28.108
Russia?! Fuck this.

378
00:27:28.277 --> 00:27:29.073
I don't have time to wait.

379
00:27:29.237 --> 00:27:30.272
We have to go to Sweden. 
- Relax.

380
00:27:30.437 --> 00:27:32.428
Don't make a fuss.

381
00:27:32.597 --> 00:27:33.667
What shall we do?

382
00:27:34.397 --> 00:27:35.751
We'll take you to the border.

383
00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:36.907
I'm sure,

384
00:27:37.077 --> 00:27:39.671
We'll leave without money and that's it?

385
00:27:39.837 --> 00:27:40.872
I can give you

386
00:27:41.037 --> 00:27:42.835
a few hundred marks right now.

387
00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:45.591
You'll get more once the logs are sold.

388
00:27:46.477 --> 00:27:47.387
Kaisa!

389
00:27:59.357 --> 00:28:00.472
Mario.

390
00:28:46.877 --> 00:28:49.346
We'll be at the border soon.

391
00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:52.627
Get up. We are near the border.

392
00:28:58.597 --> 00:29:00.793
I would like to be compensated.

393
00:29:09.877 --> 00:29:11.197
What did she say?

394
00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:14.469
She wants to do it.

395
00:29:14.637 --> 00:29:16.548
To do what?

396
00:29:16.717 --> 00:29:18.390
This.

397
00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:20.870
You do it.

398
00:29:21.717 --> 00:29:22.787
Why me?

399
00:29:22.957 --> 00:29:24.072
She likes your muscles.

400
00:29:24.237 --> 00:29:26.114
It's your own fault.

401
00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:39.026
The lumber yard chick sure knows,

402
00:29:39.197 --> 00:29:40.995
how to handle wood.

403
00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:12.912
Crooks, we're going to get caught here.

404
00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:15.353
Let's cross the border somewhere else.

405
00:30:15.517 --> 00:30:17.554
See you in Sweden. I'm going.

406
00:30:20.157 --> 00:30:21.670
Come on,

407
00:30:21.837 --> 00:30:23.396
Let's go.

408
00:31:12.317 --> 00:31:14.433
We fled the Soviet Union

409
00:31:14.597 --> 00:31:17.350
and need political asylum.

410
00:32:08.317 --> 00:32:11.230
Brave refugees

411
00:32:15.757 --> 00:32:19.466
Welcome to the Estonian House in Stockholm.

412
00:32:27.317 --> 00:32:28.955
I am your grandfather,

413
00:32:29.117 --> 00:32:30.676
Your Swedish grandfather.

414
00:32:30.837 --> 00:32:33.875
Two generations meet in freedom.

415
00:32:35.837 --> 00:32:37.066
Our heroes,

416
00:32:37.677 --> 00:32:39.907
Heroes. 
- What a joke!

417
00:32:40.077 --> 00:32:43.069
He will not stay with us.

418
00:32:43.237 --> 00:32:45.148
The boys will tell us

419
00:32:45.317 --> 00:32:49.550
how is life in bolshevik occupied Estonia

420
00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:51.469
and why they decided to take on

421
00:32:51.637 --> 00:32:55.517
the dangerous escape from that slavery.

422
00:33:10.997 --> 00:33:12.476
Well.

423
00:33:14.117 --> 00:33:15.152
The main...

424
00:33:16.397 --> 00:33:18.707
The main reason was...

425
00:33:22.477 --> 00:33:23.797
It was lame, there.

426
00:33:24.797 --> 00:33:26.356
It was hard...

427
00:33:28.477 --> 00:33:29.876
Very hard

428
00:33:30.037 --> 00:33:32.028
to take up bodybuilding.

429
00:33:35.637 --> 00:33:37.548
He means building a life for oneself.

430
00:33:37.717 --> 00:33:39.708
Yes, of course,

431
00:33:41.797 --> 00:33:43.549
Tell them about the army.

432
00:33:48.077 --> 00:33:50.114
We do not want to fight

433
00:33:50.277 --> 00:33:52.632
for the Red Army in Afghanistan.

434
00:33:56.637 --> 00:33:59.550
We condemn the Soviet Union's

435
00:33:59.717 --> 00:34:01.230
imperialistic plans

436
00:34:01.397 --> 00:34:03.752
and threats of nuclear war.

437
00:34:03.917 --> 00:34:05.351
We want a free world.

438
00:34:06.717 --> 00:34:09.391
Don't let people be separated by borders

439
00:34:09.557 --> 00:34:11.912
and an arms race.

440
00:34:12.437 --> 00:34:13.586
We demand freedom

441
00:34:13.757 --> 00:34:15.555
to all political prisoners!

442
00:34:25.437 --> 00:34:27.826
Our heroes,

443
00:34:32.677 --> 00:34:35.191
Lars
-Jukka Lampinen, producer.

444
00:34:35.357 --> 00:34:36.552
I've worked with ABBA.

445
00:34:36.717 --> 00:34:38.355
You know ABBA, right?

446
00:34:38.517 --> 00:34:39.666
Money, money, money.

447
00:34:39.837 --> 00:34:41.350
Hello. 
- Hello.

448
00:34:41.517 --> 00:34:43.076
We should work together.

449
00:34:43.237 --> 00:34:44.386
Co-production.

450
00:34:44.557 --> 00:34:46.116
I'll make popstars out of you.

451
00:34:46.277 --> 00:34:48.507
Superstars. 
- Move along.

452
00:34:48.677 --> 00:34:50.987
What did he say? 
- I don't know.

453
00:34:51.157 --> 00:34:53.148
Superstars!

454
00:34:53.317 --> 00:34:56.992
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

455
00:35:04.637 --> 00:35:06.708
Is this what they gave you?

456
00:35:06.877 --> 00:35:08.231
Yes,

457
00:35:09.037 --> 00:35:11.313
Where is the key?

458
00:35:11.477 --> 00:35:13.593
They didn't give me one.

459
00:35:14.677 --> 00:35:16.987
This is a keychain.

460
00:35:18.237 --> 00:35:19.796
I don't know.

461
00:35:20.797 --> 00:35:21.867
It doesn't fit.

462
00:35:33.757 --> 00:35:35.350
Here!

463
00:35:42.997 --> 00:35:44.351
Tecan't..

464
00:35:46.197 --> 00:35:49.030
Wow. Did you hear that? 
- Yes.

465
00:35:57.917 --> 00:35:59.555
Holy shit.

466
00:35:59.717 --> 00:36:01.276
Welcome to the West.

467
00:36:01.437 --> 00:36:03.075
We made it!

468
00:36:24.397 --> 00:36:26.035
Sure the Estonian House is paying?

469
00:36:26.197 --> 00:36:26.868
Bronze.

470
00:36:27.037 --> 00:36:28.232
Don't worry so much.

471
00:36:28.397 --> 00:36:31.469
Enjoy Life. 
- Idiot.

472
00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:38.435
A bronze tan!

473
00:36:41.077 --> 00:36:42.033
We did it!

474
00:36:43.477 --> 00:36:47.550
Holy shit, you crooks!

475
00:36:48.557 --> 00:36:50.389
The Soviets are attacking!

476
00:36:52.037 --> 00:36:55.428
Sex On The Beach, 
Black Russian,

477
00:36:55.597 --> 00:36:57.474
Martini cocktail.

478
00:36:57.637 --> 00:36:58.752
Three. 
- Yes, I know.

479
00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:01.557
Hello. Three!

480
00:37:01.717 --> 00:37:03.594
Pina Cotas. 
- What?

481
00:37:03.757 --> 00:37:05.236
Pina Cota. 
- Three Pina Coladas.

482
00:37:11.637 --> 00:37:14.550
Check this out - real Swedes.

483
00:37:17.917 --> 00:37:19.112
Welcome.

484
00:38:14.517 --> 00:38:15.712
Good morning.

485
00:38:16.677 --> 00:38:18.076
Good morning.

486
00:38:20.437 --> 00:38:21.427
My name is Rulle Karlsson.

487
00:38:21.597 --> 00:38:23.713
From the migration agency.

488
00:38:24.717 --> 00:38:26.594
Karlsson.

489
00:38:26.757 --> 00:38:28.111
Where is the propeller?

490
00:38:29.477 --> 00:38:30.990
Yes, like Karlsson-on-the
-Roof.

491
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:36.436
You are moving to the refugee centre.

492
00:38:36.597 --> 00:38:37.826
What is he saying?

493
00:38:37.997 --> 00:38:39.271
He will give you a 100 kronas,

494
00:38:39.437 --> 00:38:41.428
if you pinch his ass.

495
00:38:41.597 --> 00:38:43.474
You will be integrated

496
00:38:43.637 --> 00:38:45.628
into the Swedish society.

497
00:38:45.797 --> 00:38:47.674
The car is waiting outside.

498
00:38:48.357 --> 00:38:51.395
Get dressed, I will be waiting.

499
00:38:52.637 --> 00:38:54.071
Good luck.

500
00:38:54.877 --> 00:38:56.436
What did he say?

501
00:38:57.317 --> 00:38:58.546
Who's that?

502
00:39:04.197 --> 00:39:05.232
Champagne,

503
00:39:05.397 --> 00:39:08.196
mini-bar, bathrobes,

504
00:39:08.357 --> 00:39:10.553
room service, sheets,

505
00:39:10.717 --> 00:39:13.072
room renovation, the remote control.

506
00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:16.673
What is this? On the top.

507
00:39:16.837 --> 00:39:19.192
New water for the swimming pool.

508
00:39:26.317 --> 00:39:28.706
Welcome to the refugee centre 31
-B.

509
00:39:42.317 --> 00:39:43.637
Buchenwald.

510
00:39:48.277 --> 00:39:49.631
Hello-hello.

511
00:39:51.357 --> 00:39:52.233
Maybe they don't know

512
00:39:52.397 --> 00:39:53.831
that we are the boat heroes.

513
00:39:53.997 --> 00:39:55.670
Everyone here is a boat hero.

514
00:39:56.797 --> 00:39:58.276
Here in Sweden

515
00:39:58.437 --> 00:40:03.147
we want refugees to feel like home.

516
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:04.955
Hi. 
- Hi.

517
00:40:05.117 --> 00:40:06.187
All good? 
- Yes.

518
00:40:36.117 --> 00:40:37.994
Smells funny. 
- Something's burning.

519
00:40:42.077 --> 00:40:43.954
Ralf Tamm? 
- Yes.

520
00:40:44.117 --> 00:40:45.437
Phone for Ralfie-boy.

521
00:40:49.477 --> 00:40:50.547
Hello.

522
00:40:55.957 --> 00:40:57.356
Yes,

523
00:40:57.917 --> 00:41:00.511
Sure, Bye.

524
00:41:04.037 --> 00:41:05.596
Grandpa called.

525
00:41:05.757 --> 00:41:06.952
He found a good job for us.

526
00:41:07.117 --> 00:41:10.792
Hey, hero. Let's get out of this place.

527
00:41:19.797 --> 00:41:22.186
Now, the job is easy.

528
00:41:23.197 --> 00:41:26.030
You have to dig out all the dandelions.

529
00:41:27.237 --> 00:41:28.750
Starting from here

530
00:41:29.397 --> 00:41:31.468
and then move on to the next area.

531
00:41:31.637 --> 00:41:33.275
All around the factory.

532
00:41:34.077 --> 00:41:35.750
Here are some gloves.

533
00:41:35.917 --> 00:41:36.952
Drinking water.

534
00:41:37.877 --> 00:41:39.754
Twill come back at five.

535
00:41:39.917 --> 00:41:42.909
Then we'll see if
you have earned your pay.

536
00:42:00.837 --> 00:42:03.351
This is not what I had in mind.

537
00:42:05.357 --> 00:42:07.507
This makes my muscles grow wrong.

538
00:42:08.637 --> 00:42:10.469
Grow wrong?

539
00:42:10.637 --> 00:42:13.356
The right arm becomes bigger.

540
00:42:13.517 --> 00:42:14.473
Yes-yes.

541
00:42:14.637 --> 00:42:17.516
Stallone would not have done this.

542
00:42:18.437 --> 00:42:20.474
Tell your grandpa we are not idiots.

543
00:42:23.117 --> 00:42:25.472
Tell him we'll do better without him.

544
00:42:38.397 --> 00:42:39.717
When I fled to Sweden,

545
00:42:39.877 --> 00:42:41.788
I would've been thankful for such a job.

546
00:42:41.957 --> 00:42:44.107
We thought this would pay more.

547
00:42:44.277 --> 00:42:47.235
No one becomes a millionaire in Sweden.

548
00:42:47.397 --> 00:42:51.231
You have to build your life slowly.

549
00:42:51.397 --> 00:42:54.549
We don't want to build it from dirt.

550
00:42:54.717 --> 00:42:57.470
Then go back to your communist paradise,

551
00:42:57.637 --> 00:43:00.197
if you can't appreciate honest work.

552
00:43:13.317 --> 00:43:14.671
What?!

553
00:43:16.237 --> 00:43:18.626
This is Sweden for you.

554
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:22.715
We were supposed to get support money.

555
00:43:23.357 --> 00:43:24.427
Didn't he say...

556
00:43:25.557 --> 00:43:26.991
That boss-dude.

557
00:43:27.157 --> 00:43:28.670
You can't buy hair gel for that money.

558
00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:34.470
God damn it.

559
00:43:34.637 --> 00:43:36.913
We can't sell Western goods here.

560
00:43:37.077 --> 00:43:38.954
Genius. Did you think you'd sell

561
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:40.915
ski boots for gold here too?

562
00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:42.112
Hey.

563
00:43:45.997 --> 00:43:47.829
Who's paying the bill?

564
00:43:49.237 --> 00:43:51.114
Grandpa. 
- What?

565
00:43:55.557 --> 00:43:57.309
Listen. Wait up.

566
00:43:57.477 --> 00:43:58.876
I have an idea,

567
00:44:21.757 --> 00:44:23.111
This is it.

568
00:44:24.397 --> 00:44:25.990
Holy cow.

569
00:44:31.677 --> 00:44:33.190
House like a mausoleum.

570
00:44:33.357 --> 00:44:34.677
If he wants us to mow lawn too,

571
00:44:34.837 --> 00:44:37.067
I'll swim back home.

572
00:44:58.397 --> 00:44:59.751
Try again.

573
00:45:15.997 --> 00:45:17.317
Good girl.

574
00:45:17.477 --> 00:45:19.673
Good girl.

575
00:45:19.837 --> 00:45:23.592
I'm actually a Finn.

576
00:45:24.437 --> 00:45:26.553
Kind of a refugee, like you.

577
00:45:31.117 --> 00:45:33.711
You smell like money,

578
00:45:33.877 --> 00:45:37.074
charisma and a story.

579
00:45:37.237 --> 00:45:38.989
I've got business smarts.

580
00:45:39.157 --> 00:45:41.387
When these elements meet...

581
00:45:41.557 --> 00:45:42.956
Kaboom!

582
00:45:43.117 --> 00:45:45.074
And ching ching, ching ching.

583
00:45:45.237 --> 00:45:46.511
Money starts to rain.

584
00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:48.350
What is he saying?

585
00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:50.510
Hey, darling.

586
00:45:50.677 --> 00:45:53.237
We are out of gin.

587
00:45:53.397 --> 00:45:55.388
Again.

588
00:45:55.557 --> 00:45:57.468
One second.

589
00:45:57.637 --> 00:45:58.957
Camilla, honey.

590
00:45:59.117 --> 00:46:01.916
Can't you see that I have clients?

591
00:46:02.077 --> 00:46:04.068
Fucking liar.

592
00:46:04.237 --> 00:46:06.467
Hot stuff.

593
00:46:06.637 --> 00:46:08.389
My woman.

594
00:46:08.557 --> 00:46:11.675
She was elected Miss Stockholm in...

595
00:46:11.837 --> 00:46:12.986
..1956.

596
00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:15.196
What did he say?

597
00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:17.991
He's wife is a whore.

598
00:46:18.157 --> 00:46:20.353
The bottles shall do the speaking.

599
00:46:22.957 --> 00:46:24.311
He said it like that?

600
00:46:24.477 --> 00:46:25.353
Bottoms up.

601
00:46:36.357 --> 00:46:38.746
We'll build a product out of you.

602
00:46:38.917 --> 00:46:42.148
Three dissidents from the USSR who rock.

603
00:46:42.317 --> 00:46:44.308
A rock band.

604
00:46:44.477 --> 00:46:46.354
We can't sing.

605
00:46:46.517 --> 00:46:48.667
What is going on?

606
00:46:48.837 --> 00:46:51.272
The road is open to the top.

607
00:46:56.717 --> 00:46:58.276
Alright.

608
00:46:58.837 --> 00:47:01.113
Way to go.

609
00:47:01.917 --> 00:47:04.557
Super Trouper and Mamma Mia,

610
00:47:07.957 --> 00:47:09.994
A star is born,

611
00:47:10.557 --> 00:47:12.833
And it's burning brightly.

612
00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:15.591
More rock and roll.

613
00:47:15.757 --> 00:47:17.714
Get closer to each other.

614
00:47:17.877 --> 00:47:19.276
Closer.

615
00:47:20.397 --> 00:47:21.353
All right then.

616
00:47:23.237 --> 00:47:24.591
Mouths open.

617
00:47:24.757 --> 00:47:27.271
Mouth open.

618
00:47:27.437 --> 00:47:28.313
More.

619
00:47:31.397 --> 00:47:34.071
Then your hips. 
Move them, dammit.

620
00:47:34.237 --> 00:47:36.308
Move.

621
00:47:37.597 --> 00:47:39.190
Stick your tongue out.

622
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:40.950
Out. There you go.

623
00:47:41.117 --> 00:47:42.551
Good.

624
00:47:42.717 --> 00:47:44.230
Put this here.

625
00:47:44.397 --> 00:47:45.796
Put your tongue out.

626
00:47:45.957 --> 00:47:47.675
can't,

627
00:47:47.837 --> 00:47:50.351
Tcan't doit.

628
00:47:50.517 --> 00:47:52.394
There.

629
00:47:55.877 --> 00:47:56.947
Shit.

630
00:47:57.117 --> 00:47:59.074
Let's take a picture.

631
00:47:59.237 --> 00:48:01.228
Grimace, darn it.

632
00:48:06.837 --> 00:48:08.555
Thank you. Close your mouths.

633
00:48:14.557 --> 00:48:16.230
Is this in fashion over here?

634
00:48:16.397 --> 00:48:19.037
In fashion? He looks like a slut,

635
00:48:19.197 --> 00:48:22.315
who has been inflated through his ass.

636
00:48:22.477 --> 00:48:23.148
What are you laughing about?

637
00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:26.355
One more photo for the poster.

638
00:48:27.357 --> 00:48:28.586
Time is money.

639
00:48:28.757 --> 00:48:30.828
Speaking of money...

640
00:48:30.997 --> 00:48:33.386
Listen. When these photos go out

641
00:48:33.557 --> 00:48:34.353
gold dust starts to rain on you.

642
00:48:34.517 --> 00:48:36.349
What is he mumbling? 
- I don't know.

643
00:48:37.717 --> 00:48:38.946
Say something.

644
00:48:39.117 --> 00:48:41.028
Hey, listen.

645
00:48:41.197 --> 00:48:43.552
We don't know how to play or sing.

646
00:48:43.717 --> 00:48:45.469
Why won't you believe it?

647
00:48:45.637 --> 00:48:48.026
Peace, my friend.

648
00:48:48.197 --> 00:48:49.676
Backing singers will sing.

649
00:48:49.837 --> 00:48:50.872
You won't sing.

650
00:48:51.037 --> 00:48:52.186
Pros are singing.

651
00:48:52.357 --> 00:48:53.791
I've got three singers.

652
00:48:53.957 --> 00:48:56.233
Voices of angels.

653
00:48:56.397 --> 00:48:58.707
But looks of toads.

654
00:48:58.877 --> 00:49:01.790
No commercial potential at all.

655
00:49:04.317 --> 00:49:06.433
Ghost singers for The Dissidents.

656
00:49:06.597 --> 00:49:08.110
You will get on stage.

657
00:49:08.277 --> 00:49:10.587
Dance and open your mouths.

658
00:49:10.757 --> 00:49:12.589
You can dance, right?

659
00:49:12.757 --> 00:49:14.907
Can we dance?

660
00:49:16.517 --> 00:49:19.077
Do you know breakdancing?

661
00:49:19.237 --> 00:49:21.274
Now you're talking.

662
00:49:23.597 --> 00:49:26.430
Good, bravo.

663
00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:29.156
Exactly like that.

664
00:49:29.317 --> 00:49:31.194
Something like...

665
00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:34.513
Yes, yes, exactly.

666
00:49:35.757 --> 00:49:36.667
This is sick,

667
00:49:36.837 --> 00:49:38.748
Come here.

668
00:49:38.917 --> 00:49:40.351
I will not make a fool of myself.

669
00:49:41.277 --> 00:49:43.109
I can give interviews for money.

670
00:49:43.277 --> 00:49:44.870
I can train spies.

671
00:49:45.037 --> 00:49:46.994
But I will not do this freak show.

672
00:49:47.157 --> 00:49:50.434
Nobody wants our interviews.

673
00:49:50.597 --> 00:49:52.793
Crooks? 
- You should open your wallet.

674
00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:54.789
Don't be petty, Goran.

675
00:49:54.957 --> 00:49:56.709
Have you got no ambition?

676
00:49:56.877 --> 00:49:58.390
Hey, boys. Boys?

677
00:50:00.837 --> 00:50:02.635
You can't sing, but...

678
00:50:03.797 --> 00:50:05.595
Can you write?

679
00:50:06.197 --> 00:50:08.108
Your story!

680
00:50:08.277 --> 00:50:09.756
What?

681
00:50:24.957 --> 00:50:26.675
Darkness.

682
00:50:26.837 --> 00:50:28.396
The cold sea.

683
00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:31.035
The lights were blinking hauntingly

684
00:50:31.197 --> 00:50:32.790
in the darkness.

685
00:50:32.957 --> 00:50:35.233
The boarder patrol sent special units

686
00:50:35.397 --> 00:50:37.149
into the darkness.

687
00:50:37.317 --> 00:50:39.069
Darkness.

688
00:50:39.237 --> 00:50:41.831
Nothing but darkness.

689
00:50:48.237 --> 00:50:50.513
I have not finished the last sentence.

690
00:50:50.677 --> 00:50:52.236
It starts with "darkness".

691
00:50:54.917 --> 00:50:55.748
You have nothing but darkness

692
00:50:55.917 --> 00:50:58.306
in your brain.

693
00:51:00.637 --> 00:51:03.595
I hope Lars
-Jukka has a better idea.

694
00:51:05.717 --> 00:51:06.912
Porn?

695
00:51:07.077 --> 00:51:09.353
Not porn. Erotica,

696
00:51:09.517 --> 00:51:12.635
Let's take an artistic approach...

697
00:51:12.797 --> 00:51:15.186
He wants us to do porn. 
- No, erotica.

698
00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:16.836
Stallone did porn.

699
00:51:16.997 --> 00:51:18.829
Stallone, Where is he now?

700
00:51:18.997 --> 00:51:21.432
What? 
- Where is Stallone?

701
00:51:21.597 --> 00:51:23.588
What does Stallone do now?

702
00:51:23.757 --> 00:51:25.430
He is Rambo. 
- Yes!

703
00:51:25.597 --> 00:51:27.713
A respected film star.

704
00:51:27.877 --> 00:51:28.833
A movie star.

705
00:51:28.997 --> 00:51:30.351
What is he blabbering now?

706
00:51:30.517 --> 00:51:31.587
Let's hear him out.

707
00:51:31.757 --> 00:51:33.031
We came from behind the Iron Curtain.

708
00:51:33.197 --> 00:51:35.347
We are heroes. 
We don't do porn,

709
00:51:35.517 --> 00:51:37.827
Erotica, erotica.

710
00:51:37.997 --> 00:51:40.591
What exactly do you want us to do?

711
00:51:40.757 --> 00:51:41.827
Ralf, you cannot be serious.

712
00:51:41.997 --> 00:51:44.034
Just relax. Let's hear him out.

713
00:51:44.197 --> 00:51:45.267
You'll get money.

714
00:51:45.437 --> 00:51:47.314
And beautiful girls.

715
00:51:47.477 --> 00:51:49.753
Double bonuses.

716
00:51:50.837 --> 00:51:52.714
Fucking pimp. 
- Mario.

717
00:51:52.877 --> 00:51:54.151
One oldie lets us dig dirt,

718
00:51:54.317 --> 00:51:56.308
another one wants to dig us himself.

719
00:51:56.477 --> 00:51:57.831
Stop whining.

720
00:51:57.997 --> 00:51:59.317
Think of a better plan.

721
00:51:59.477 --> 00:52:01.946
You dragged us here. 
- I did?

722
00:52:02.117 --> 00:52:03.630
We cannot go back home.

723
00:52:03.797 --> 00:52:05.310
I don't know what to do.

724
00:52:05.477 --> 00:52:06.592
Let him think of something.

725
00:52:06.757 --> 00:52:08.156
You are getting on my nerves.

726
00:52:08.317 --> 00:52:10.035
Hey, we... 
- You should calm down!

727
00:52:10.197 --> 00:52:11.267
Who? 
- You should.

728
00:52:11.437 --> 00:52:12.836
Who? 
- You,

729
00:52:12.997 --> 00:52:15.466
Get back on that boat and go home.

730
00:52:15.637 --> 00:52:16.911
Do porn with Rita and your kid.

731
00:52:17.077 --> 00:52:18.351
Shut up.

732
00:52:18.517 --> 00:52:19.871
Do you hear me? Shut up.

733
00:52:20.037 --> 00:52:21.755
Guys, relax.

734
00:52:23.477 --> 00:52:24.706
Calm down.

735
00:52:24.877 --> 00:52:26.868
You're crazy. 
- Stop it.

736
00:52:27.037 --> 00:52:28.107
Shut up already.

737
00:52:28.277 --> 00:52:30.507
God damn it. 
- You're fucking crazy.

738
00:52:32.277 --> 00:52:34.507
Get out, you Russkies!

739
00:52:51.157 --> 00:52:52.477
What now?

740
00:52:55.597 --> 00:52:56.917
Are we going to live here?

741
00:52:57.677 --> 00:52:59.395
With that support money?

742
00:53:00.597 --> 00:53:02.235
We have to get a job.

743
00:53:02.397 --> 00:53:03.990
Then we can live more comfortably.

744
00:53:04.157 --> 00:53:05.352
Ajob?

745
00:53:06.397 --> 00:53:07.831
Yes,

746
00:53:08.877 --> 00:53:10.993
Let's pull some overalls on again.

747
00:53:11.677 --> 00:53:12.826
Overalls...

748
00:53:14.877 --> 00:53:15.867
Hey.

749
00:53:16.037 --> 00:53:17.266
How do you say in Swedish:

750
00:53:17.437 --> 00:53:20.668
"Give me your money
and keys to your Volvo"?

751
00:53:22.837 --> 00:53:23.986
[In Swedish] Good luck.

752
00:54:07.117 --> 00:54:08.630
Nobody cares, I told you.

753
00:54:08.797 --> 00:54:10.549
What did you get? 
- Muscle drink.

754
00:54:17.037 --> 00:54:17.913
Dishwashing liquid.

755
00:54:18.077 --> 00:54:19.397
What is that shit?!

756
00:54:19.557 --> 00:54:22.151
It's for washing your muscles.

757
00:54:35.557 --> 00:54:36.513
Thank you.

758
00:54:56.197 --> 00:54:58.507
How much are they paying you?

759
00:54:58.677 --> 00:55:00.350
20 kronas.

760
00:55:00.517 --> 00:55:02.554
20 kronas?! - 20 kronas?

761
00:55:02.717 --> 00:55:04.435
20 kronas?

762
00:55:05.917 --> 00:55:07.794
Look, minus fifty percent.

763
00:55:07.957 --> 00:55:09.106
Stealing is half off.

764
00:55:09.277 --> 00:55:12.030
Don't, I'l get fired. 
- What?

765
00:55:12.197 --> 00:55:13.870
Turn us in, friend.

766
00:55:15.037 --> 00:55:16.869
Guard the ducks.

767
00:55:43.797 --> 00:55:45.231
Stop.

768
00:55:51.077 --> 00:55:52.556
You are the boat guy.

769
00:55:53.957 --> 00:55:55.675
From the Soviet Union.

770
00:55:56.917 --> 00:55:58.476
I read about you in the papers.

771
00:56:00.237 --> 00:56:03.867
You like Sweden?

772
00:56:04.757 --> 00:56:05.952
Is Sweden OK?

773
00:56:07.277 --> 00:56:08.312
Yes,

774
00:56:09.437 --> 00:56:11.997
[In Russian] Everything is alright.

775
00:56:14.757 --> 00:56:16.475
Can I get your autograph?

776
00:56:18.477 --> 00:56:19.069
Please.

777
00:56:22.717 --> 00:56:23.946
To Sibylla.

778
00:56:28.317 --> 00:56:31.070
You would like to...

779
00:56:32.517 --> 00:56:35.509
...learn more about Swedish culture?

780
00:56:39.637 --> 00:56:41.469
Culture... Yes.

781
00:56:57.757 --> 00:56:59.555
Thank you. 
- Thank you.

782
00:57:03.517 --> 00:57:05.508
Look, Estonian boys.

783
00:57:06.837 --> 00:57:08.032
Subverting capitalism,

784
00:57:08.197 --> 00:57:09.995
dispensing resources.

785
00:57:11.037 --> 00:57:13.074
Relax. I only wanted to know,

786
00:57:13.237 --> 00:57:15.387
if you feel homesick.

787
00:57:15.557 --> 00:57:16.752
KGB.

788
00:57:16.917 --> 00:57:19.670
Maybe we can talk?

789
00:57:21.957 --> 00:57:23.027
About what?

790
00:57:23.197 --> 00:57:24.426
Twill let you call home.

791
00:57:24.597 --> 00:57:26.235
I bet your parents are waiting.

792
00:57:26.397 --> 00:57:27.671
Here.

793
00:57:28.477 --> 00:57:29.990
Is this your plan?

794
00:57:30.637 --> 00:57:32.150
Make us homesick

795
00:57:32.317 --> 00:57:34.228
and lock us up, when we come back.

796
00:57:41.597 --> 00:57:43.315
It would be nice to call home.

797
00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:52.517
You, traitor, shut up and listen!

798
00:57:52.677 --> 00:57:54.748
What the hell are you doing?

799
00:57:54.917 --> 00:57:56.590
What will my comrades think?

800
00:57:56.757 --> 00:57:59.112
They won't even shake my hand!

801
00:57:59.277 --> 00:58:01.996
Have you forgotten what I taught you?

802
00:58:08.677 --> 00:58:11.191
Rita moved in.

803
00:58:11.357 --> 00:58:13.428
Her dad kicked her out.

804
00:58:14.957 --> 00:58:16.948
Ralf? 
- Rita.

805
00:58:17.117 --> 00:58:19.427
Ralf, don't worry about us.

806
00:58:20.637 --> 00:58:22.196
We will manage.

807
00:58:25.237 --> 00:58:26.989
Ralf.

808
00:58:28.197 --> 00:58:29.870
I promise I will do something.

809
00:58:30.037 --> 00:58:32.028
Ralf, be careful.

810
00:58:33.957 --> 00:58:34.913
Ralf!

811
00:58:53.637 --> 00:58:57.028
Mario is out of his mind.

812
00:58:57.197 --> 00:58:59.427
What? 
- He shouldn't drink.

813
00:59:03.717 --> 00:59:04.787
Stop!

814
00:59:07.077 --> 00:59:08.397
Mario, what are you doing?

815
00:59:09.317 --> 00:59:11.354
Relax. 
- What happened?

816
00:59:11.517 --> 00:59:12.951
Let's talk.

817
00:59:13.117 --> 00:59:15.233
Talk to us. 
- Calm down.

818
00:59:15.397 --> 00:59:16.592
What happened?

819
00:59:16.757 --> 00:59:18.714
My brother is dead.

820
00:59:18.877 --> 00:59:20.754
My brother is dead!

821
00:59:22.837 --> 00:59:25.147
They paid him back for avoiding the army.

822
00:59:26.997 --> 00:59:29.068
Sent him straight to Afghanistan.

823
00:59:32.157 --> 00:59:34.068
He blew up!

824
00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:35.989
He is dead!

825
00:59:37.477 --> 00:59:38.990
Calm down.

826
00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:49.028
I have no one left.

827
00:59:49.637 --> 00:59:52.231
You have us. 
- Relax.

828
00:59:57.917 --> 00:59:59.874
What happened here?

829
01:00:00.037 --> 01:00:02.028
We can talk about this.

830
01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:04.313
This is a conflict.

831
01:00:04.477 --> 01:00:06.707
His brother... 
- His brother died!

832
01:00:06.877 --> 01:00:09.391
Get out! 
- We can...

833
01:00:09.557 --> 01:00:10.672
Get lost! 
- Out!

834
01:00:16.477 --> 01:00:18.707
This is it! You are out of here!

835
01:00:18.877 --> 01:00:21.790
Tomorrow morning! God damn it!

836
01:00:21.957 --> 01:00:23.630
You will get your passports

837
01:00:23.797 --> 01:00:25.549
and you are gone!

838
01:00:37.797 --> 01:00:39.913
Where to now, Swedes?

839
01:00:43.517 --> 01:00:44.916
This is our land now.

840
01:00:45.717 --> 01:00:47.708
A million opportunities.

841
01:01:36.757 --> 01:01:40.148
Ah, The Dissidents.

842
01:01:44.557 --> 01:01:46.912
The house will be taken from me.

843
01:01:50.557 --> 01:01:52.116
The bank.

844
01:01:58.477 --> 01:02:00.673
Fuck...

845
01:02:00.837 --> 01:02:02.908
Pippi must be walked.

846
01:02:03.877 --> 01:02:05.550
Camilla left it to us.

847
01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:13.506
Camilla.

848
01:02:19.077 --> 01:02:20.556
I've got a son.

849
01:02:22.077 --> 01:02:24.591
I haven't seen him for twenty years.

850
01:02:27.357 --> 01:02:29.712
I left my wife and son in Finland.

851
01:02:31.997 --> 01:02:32.793
When I came to Sweden

852
01:02:32.957 --> 01:02:35.426
like all fortune hunters.

853
01:02:37.237 --> 01:02:40.229
At first I was
on a roll. Oh boy.

854
01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:43.151
But then...

855
01:02:45.357 --> 01:02:47.234
When I saw you I thought...

856
01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:51.311
There's finally my chance.

857
01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:54.071
Now I'll make a huge comeback.

858
01:02:56.597 --> 01:02:57.951
But...

859
01:03:02.317 --> 01:03:04.149
I left a girl in Estonia.

860
01:03:06.117 --> 01:03:07.471
Rita.

861
01:03:10.237 --> 01:03:12.274
She's pregnant.

862
01:03:17.197 --> 01:03:19.188
You can return to Finland.

863
01:03:20.037 --> 01:03:21.914
But we back to...

864
01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:25.348
..the Soviet Union.

865
01:03:26.357 --> 01:03:27.711
No way.

866
01:03:38.717 --> 01:03:40.276
Ralf.

867
01:03:40.437 --> 01:03:42.189
I hope they'll forgive me.

868
01:03:44.437 --> 01:03:46.155
Finland, damn it.

869
01:03:46.317 --> 01:03:47.955
Drive to the harbour.

870
01:03:49.077 --> 01:03:51.751
Don't show Pippi any horror movies.

871
01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:53.988
She'll lose her sleep.

872
01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:01.993
So?

873
01:04:02.157 --> 01:04:04.114
What now?

874
01:04:05.317 --> 01:04:07.308
We have a mansion in our hands.

875
01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:09.514
We live in a free country.

876
01:04:10.797 --> 01:04:12.276
We will think of something.

877
01:04:12.437 --> 01:04:13.871
A free country?

878
01:04:15.437 --> 01:04:16.916
Alright.

879
01:04:17.077 --> 01:04:18.556
Let's be free.

880
01:04:26.157 --> 01:04:28.194
It is not working. Take it back.

881
01:04:28.357 --> 01:04:30.155
Do you have the receipt?

882
01:04:30.317 --> 01:04:31.955
Sorry, you have to have the receipt.

883
01:04:32.117 --> 01:04:33.915
Can you come back with it?

884
01:04:45.357 --> 01:04:47.155
Someone's looking for a welder.

885
01:04:47.837 --> 01:04:49.987
Let me guess. 20 kronas a day.

886
01:04:50.877 --> 01:04:52.754
At least you'd have sparkle in the eyes.

887
01:04:53.877 --> 01:04:55.629
We did not come here to work.

888
01:04:55.797 --> 01:04:57.913
We could've done that in Estonia.

889
01:05:01.237 --> 01:05:02.910
We have to pull a serious job.

890
01:05:04.557 --> 01:05:06.707
And after that - to the States,

891
01:05:06.877 --> 01:05:08.390
What kind of job?

892
01:05:10.757 --> 01:05:12.555
A gas station.

893
01:05:12.717 --> 01:05:13.946
A jewelry store,

894
01:05:14.117 --> 01:05:16.028
Fast in, fast out.

895
01:05:16.197 --> 01:05:17.631
Bye bye, Sweden.

896
01:05:20.157 --> 01:05:21.750
Are you serious?

897
01:05:23.557 --> 01:05:24.433
Forget about it.

898
01:05:24.597 --> 01:05:26.235
The locals are a bunch of Moomins.

899
01:05:27.077 --> 01:05:28.556
Smiling like idiots

900
01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:31.027
while you rip them off.

901
01:05:31.197 --> 01:05:32.835
What is there to think about?

902
01:05:33.517 --> 01:05:35.110
It is not like stealing food.

903
01:05:36.357 --> 01:05:38.075
You could go to jail.

904
01:05:39.237 --> 01:05:39.954
You were not afraid

905
01:05:40.117 --> 01:05:41.391
of the Russian border guards,

906
01:05:41.557 --> 01:05:44.436
but you are scared of Svenssons in vests.

907
01:05:45.677 --> 01:05:46.712
Well, Meathead.

908
01:05:46.877 --> 01:05:48.197
Are you scared of security guys

909
01:05:48.317 --> 01:05:49.637
armed with combs?

910
01:05:49.797 --> 01:05:51.231
Are you Rambo or not?

911
01:05:51.397 --> 01:05:53.070
Don't...

912
01:05:55.477 --> 01:05:57.195
Someone promised

913
01:05:57.357 --> 01:06:01.146
to teach me Swedish culture,

914
01:06:04.317 --> 01:06:05.466
Watch this.

915
01:06:35.717 --> 01:06:37.196
What is this? Come on!

916
01:06:37.357 --> 01:06:38.472
Ralf. 
- Ralf!

917
01:06:38.637 --> 01:06:42.551
Don't worry, I got my brother's money.

918
01:06:42.717 --> 01:06:44.230
Are you serious? 
- Of course.

919
01:06:44.397 --> 01:06:45.831
Hop in. We will give you a lift.

920
01:06:45.997 --> 01:06:47.988
Better than your dad's Lada.

921
01:06:48.157 --> 01:06:49.386
No way.

922
01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:51.594
Unbelievable.

923
01:06:56.997 --> 01:06:58.590
What is this?

924
01:06:58.757 --> 01:07:01.112
Sweden's migration agency. 
- Give it back.

925
01:07:01.277 --> 01:07:03.029
You want to bring your chick here?

926
01:07:03.197 --> 01:07:05.108
Yes. I do.

927
01:07:05.277 --> 01:07:07.314
Cute little family.

928
01:07:07.477 --> 01:07:09.707
Stop laughing.

929
01:07:09.877 --> 01:07:10.787
You got the money,

930
01:07:10.957 --> 01:07:11.788
now you can do something reasonable.

931
01:07:11.957 --> 01:07:13.834
I spent it all on the car.

932
01:07:14.757 --> 01:07:15.428
What?

933
01:07:15.597 --> 01:07:17.429
It's our getaway car.

934
01:07:17.597 --> 01:07:19.508
We have costumes and everything.

935
01:07:19.677 --> 01:07:21.554
We'll pull this job
and get out of here.

936
01:07:21.717 --> 01:07:24.231
Jewelry shop. We picked a place.

937
01:07:24.397 --> 01:07:26.354
Downtown.

938
01:07:27.837 --> 01:07:29.748
Ralf, we need your help.

939
01:07:30.477 --> 01:07:33.071
Ralf, let's do this
and get out of Sweden.

940
01:07:33.237 --> 01:07:35.228
Shut up. Stop the car.

941
01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:39.189
Didn't you hear me? Stop the car.

942
01:07:40.077 --> 01:07:41.556
Stop this damn car!

943
01:07:43.677 --> 01:07:44.906
Alright.

944
01:07:45.077 --> 01:07:46.750
You're not fit for serious business.

945
01:07:46.917 --> 01:07:47.987
And you are?

946
01:07:48.157 --> 01:07:48.908
If you were smart,

947
01:07:49.077 --> 01:07:51.591
you wouldn't shit in your own back yard.

948
01:07:51.757 --> 01:07:53.953
You'd go to Helsinki or somewhere.

949
01:07:54.117 --> 01:07:55.630
You are weak, my friend!

950
01:07:58.157 --> 01:07:59.591
Helsinki?

951
01:08:26.117 --> 01:08:27.551
This is a bad idea.

952
01:08:27.717 --> 01:08:30.311
Don't be a wuss. 
We won't shoot anyone.

953
01:08:30.477 --> 01:08:32.832
But still. 
- Just relax.

954
01:08:32.997 --> 01:08:35.716
How about the payment?

955
01:08:57.317 --> 01:09:02.312
Yes, kayaks. Like those that the Indians have...

956
01:09:04.237 --> 01:09:06.353
Put the phone away! Get down!

957
01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:07.837
Get down!

958
01:09:07.997 --> 01:09:10.557
What are you waiting for?

959
01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.274
Get up!

960
01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:16.147
Give me the jewelry.

961
01:09:17.277 --> 01:09:19.746
Put them in the bag.

962
01:09:21.997 --> 01:09:23.988
Don't break it! 
I'l give them.

963
01:09:24.157 --> 01:09:25.591
Hurry!

964
01:09:25.757 --> 01:09:28.317
Put them in the bag.

965
01:09:30.157 --> 01:09:32.387
Close the bag now! 
- Yes, yes.

966
01:09:35.557 --> 01:09:37.309
Give the bag!

967
01:09:42.117 --> 01:09:43.551
Your compensation.

968
01:09:43.717 --> 01:09:46.357
We're no cheapskates. 
- Thank you.

969
01:09:56.197 --> 01:09:58.507
Pirjo, goddammit.

970
01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:01.631
What have you done?

971
01:10:04.637 --> 01:10:06.310
Who are the bosses now?

972
01:10:06.477 --> 01:10:08.991
I told you. It
is a piece of cake.

973
01:10:09.157 --> 01:10:12.115
It's their own fault. 
It's too easy.

974
01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.231
Jump. Jump over.

975
01:10:17.317 --> 01:10:19.354
Come here.

976
01:10:19.517 --> 01:10:21.269
Yes. Like this.

977
01:10:25.117 --> 01:10:27.267
Hop! Come here.

978
01:10:27.437 --> 01:10:28.791
Come on,

979
01:10:35.557 --> 01:10:37.355
A violent robbery in Helsinki

980
01:10:37.517 --> 01:10:38.871
left Finland in shock,

981
01:10:42.837 --> 01:10:45.556
Extremely dangerous and armed robbers

982
01:10:45.717 --> 01:10:46.468
are still on the run.

983
01:10:46.637 --> 01:10:48.230
We made the front page again.

984
01:10:48.397 --> 01:10:49.990
Do you know what you did?

985
01:10:50.157 --> 01:10:51.556
We finally did something big.

986
01:10:51.717 --> 01:10:53.947
Moping around here takes you nowhere.

987
01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:55.630
We have a new target. 
- What?

988
01:10:55.797 --> 01:10:57.151
A bank.

989
01:10:57.317 --> 01:10:59.627
We'll rob a bank
and then to the States.

990
01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:02.351
Whole Finland is looking for you.

991
01:11:02.517 --> 01:11:04.713
And here we are. In Stockholm.

992
01:11:04.877 --> 01:11:07.391
Thanks for the idea, Ralf.

993
01:11:07.557 --> 01:11:08.592
Why the sad face?

994
01:11:08.757 --> 01:11:10.270
Here, take this.

995
01:11:10.437 --> 01:11:12.030
Come with us, you'll get more.

996
01:11:12.197 --> 01:11:14.154
Everyone has a gold watch now.

997
01:11:24.277 --> 01:11:25.267
Hello?

998
01:11:25.437 --> 01:11:29.271
My son, Arto, forgave me.

999
01:11:29.437 --> 01:11:30.268
Lars
-Jukka.

1000
01:11:30.957 --> 01:11:33.756
I've got three grandkids.

1001
01:11:33.917 --> 01:11:36.386
Can you imagine? 
- That's nice.

1002
01:11:36.557 --> 01:11:38.787
How's everything going back there?

1003
01:11:42.557 --> 01:11:44.275
Ralf? 
- It's good.

1004
01:12:24.357 --> 01:12:25.950
How much are we talking about?

1005
01:12:26.117 --> 01:12:29.030
Millions. Millions!

1006
01:12:39.197 --> 01:12:41.234
Kansakoulukatu street. 
We'll park here.

1007
01:12:41.397 --> 01:12:44.230
Kansakoulukattu, 
- Kansakoulukatu.

1008
01:12:44.397 --> 01:12:46.115
Kansakoulukattu, 
- Kansakoulukatu.

1009
01:12:48.277 --> 01:12:49.506
Kansakoulukattukatu. Katu.

1010
01:12:49.677 --> 01:12:52.146
Kansakoulukatu. 
- Kansakoulukatu.

1011
01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:59.187
Kansakoulukatu. 
- Meathead.

1012
01:12:59.357 --> 01:13:01.155
Let's go.

1013
01:13:09.397 --> 01:13:10.148
Everybody down!

1014
01:13:10.317 --> 01:13:11.591
Get down! 
- Get down!

1015
01:13:11.757 --> 01:13:13.350
Face the wall!

1016
01:13:13.517 --> 01:13:15.155
Down! 
- Face the wall!

1017
01:13:15.317 --> 01:13:17.513
Face the wall! 
- Get down!

1018
01:13:17.677 --> 01:13:19.509
Down! 
- Give us the money!

1019
01:13:19.677 --> 01:13:21.668
Open the safe!

1020
01:13:24.517 --> 01:13:25.666
Get down!

1021
01:13:26.717 --> 01:13:28.276
I'm sorry...

1022
01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:31.509
But my hand does not move.

1023
01:13:31.677 --> 01:13:33.429
My hand just does not move. 
- What do I do?

1024
01:13:33.597 --> 01:13:35.554
Everybody down!

1025
01:13:37.157 --> 01:13:38.591
I'm sorry, but...

1026
01:13:38.757 --> 01:13:41.192
Faster! 
- If I'm like this and...

1027
01:13:41.357 --> 01:13:42.950
...keep my eyes closed?

1028
01:13:43.117 --> 01:13:45.916
I'won't peek at all.

1029
01:13:46.077 --> 01:13:48.193
What is he saying?

1030
01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:49.506
Lay on your side!

1031
01:13:49.677 --> 01:13:51.111
Lay on your side!

1032
01:13:51.277 --> 01:13:52.506
I'see,

1033
01:13:52.677 --> 01:13:54.475
Meathead, get behind the counter! 
- What?

1034
01:13:54.637 --> 01:13:56.435
Get behind the counter! 
- Hey, buddy.

1035
01:13:56.597 --> 01:13:57.393
A suggestion.

1036
01:13:57.557 --> 01:14:01.471
I suggest that I'll get on my back

1037
01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.150
and keep my eyes closed.

1038
01:14:03.317 --> 01:14:06.594
I mean like this. 
I'll lay on my back.

1039
01:14:06.757 --> 01:14:09.226
And shut my eyes. I won't peek. 
- Now what?

1040
01:14:09.397 --> 01:14:10.717
Behind the counter! The money!

1041
01:14:10.877 --> 01:14:12.788
Is this good? 
- Shut up!

1042
01:14:14.637 --> 01:14:16.594
I'll close my eyes and my mouth.

1043
01:14:16.757 --> 01:14:18.270
The money.

1044
01:14:20.837 --> 01:14:21.907
Hurry.

1045
01:14:22.077 --> 01:14:23.715
Hurry.

1046
01:14:23.877 --> 01:14:25.470
Hurry! Now!

1047
01:14:28.877 --> 01:14:31.995
Let it... Let it go.

1048
01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:35.789
Was it okay like this with eyes...

1049
01:14:35.957 --> 01:14:37.470
Get down!

1050
01:15:22.597 --> 01:15:23.712
Shit.

1051
01:15:33.117 --> 01:15:33.948
Stop!

1052
01:15:34.117 --> 01:15:36.393
Stop or we'll shoot! Stop!

1053
01:15:59.317 --> 01:16:01.069
Kansakoulukatu?

1054
01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:02.671
Where is Kansakoulukatu?

1055
01:16:39.717 --> 01:16:42.596
Get down!

1056
01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:49.591
On the ground!

1057
01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:17.357
It was a gift. 
- He says, it's a gift.

1058
01:17:17.517 --> 01:17:19.315
Of course.

1059
01:17:19.477 --> 01:17:20.547
And I'm Santa Claus.

1060
01:17:20.717 --> 01:17:22.674
Of course. And Tam Santa Claus.

1061
01:17:24.597 --> 01:17:26.554
Who?

1062
01:17:27.437 --> 01:17:28.871
What do you mean?

1063
01:17:29.037 --> 01:17:30.471
Iam only translating.

1064
01:17:31.837 --> 01:17:33.475
There were three of you.

1065
01:17:33.637 --> 01:17:36.151
What was Ralf's role in the system?

1066
01:17:36.317 --> 01:17:36.875
There were three of you.

1067
01:17:37.037 --> 01:17:39.153
What role did Ralf Tamm play?

1068
01:17:40.357 --> 01:17:42.553
He told us to go to Helsinki.

1069
01:17:42.717 --> 01:17:44.037
Nothing else.

1070
01:17:44.197 --> 01:17:47.633
Ralf told them to rob in Helsinki. 
- I see.

1071
01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:49.196
So he was the mastermind?

1072
01:17:49.357 --> 01:17:51.348
So he was the mastermind?

1073
01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:22.512
Shit!

1074
01:18:33.757 --> 01:18:37.591
Nobody considered us heroes anymore.

1075
01:18:38.637 --> 01:18:40.036
They made a big deal about it.

1076
01:18:40.197 --> 01:18:41.790
And we got hit hard,

1077
01:18:41.957 --> 01:18:43.550
Meathead got three years.

1078
01:18:44.957 --> 01:18:47.153
1 as the mastermind got four years.

1079
01:18:47.997 --> 01:18:49.317
From behind the Iron Curtain

1080
01:18:49.477 --> 01:18:51.036
to behind iron bars.

1081
01:18:51.197 --> 01:18:53.711
They even brought in Lars-fukka.

1082
01:18:53.877 --> 01:18:55.948
He knew nothing about the robberies.

1083
01:18:56.117 --> 01:18:57.835
Fucking gay Vikings!

1084
01:18:57.997 --> 01:18:59.146
But it turned out

1085
01:18:59.317 --> 01:19:01.149
he had been evading taxes.

1086
01:19:01.317 --> 01:19:02.273
I'll complain...

1087
01:19:07.517 --> 01:19:08.666
And Mario?

1088
01:19:08.837 --> 01:19:10.032
He disappeared.

1089
01:19:13.997 --> 01:19:16.307
Meathead didn't do so bad in jail

1090
01:19:16.477 --> 01:19:18.627
He got tons of fan mail,

1091
01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:20.993
In the eyes of Finnish and Swedish girls

1092
01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:22.477
he was a real sex symbol,

1093
01:19:22.637 --> 01:19:27.393
I want to kiss your enormous...

1094
01:19:29.517 --> 01:19:31.872
FINNISH ESTONIAN DICTIONARY

1095
01:19:37.717 --> 01:19:39.594
Lars
-Jukka didn't do bad either.

1096
01:19:39.757 --> 01:19:41.555
He started a prison choir.

1097
01:19:44.237 --> 01:19:45.955
Murderers, burglars and tax evaders

1098
01:19:46.117 --> 01:19:47.949
singing from the bottom of their hearts,

1099
01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:49.630
The record was very popular

1100
01:19:49.797 --> 01:19:52.437
and Lars
-Jukka got his comeback.

1101
01:19:52.597 --> 01:19:56.795
...Mikhail Gorbatchev has started his big reforms

1102
01:19:56.957 --> 01:20:02.236
that seem to shake the whole Soviet system...

1103
01:20:02.477 --> 01:20:05.754
Twas a refugee father like my grandpa once.

1104
01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:07.351
But the free West

1105
01:20:07.517 --> 01:20:10.794
was not so free at the moment.

1106
01:20:14.997 --> 01:20:16.431
And then I got a strange postcard.

1107
01:20:23.517 --> 01:20:25.428
BUENOS DIAS!

1108
01:20:27.837 --> 01:20:30.067
I got out after four years,

1109
01:20:30.237 --> 01:20:32.467
Berlin Wall was taken down the same year.

1110
01:20:32.637 --> 01:20:35.516
The Iron Curtain became
a thing of the past.

1111
01:20:35.677 --> 01:20:37.270
Meathead had made a life for himself.

1112
01:20:37.437 --> 01:20:39.508
In a totally legal way.

1113
01:20:39.677 --> 01:20:40.633
What now?

1114
01:20:40.797 --> 01:20:42.834
I mean, after the party.

1115
01:20:42.997 --> 01:20:45.591
I guess I have get used to freedom.

1116
01:20:48.237 --> 01:20:49.386
It's my life.

1117
01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:56.708
Sybilla, start the car.

1118
01:21:05.557 --> 01:21:07.514
Alright, let's go.

1119
01:21:08.117 --> 01:21:10.427
We both got a new chance.

1120
01:21:10.597 --> 01:21:12.315
But Mario...

1121
01:21:12.477 --> 01:21:14.912
He had dissappeared.

1122
01:21:23.477 --> 01:21:26.071
Iknew who I had to identify.

1123
01:21:27.997 --> 01:21:29.396
I had decided.

1124
01:21:29.557 --> 01:21:30.752
Twill punch him twice.

1125
01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:33.594
Once for the past

1126
01:21:33.757 --> 01:21:36.112
and once for this present mess,

1127
01:21:36.757 --> 01:21:38.987
Iwan to give him two good punches.

1128
01:21:39.717 --> 01:21:41.913
Before the cops take me down.

1129
01:21:44.197 --> 01:21:45.392
Ihave to do it

1130
01:22:04.077 --> 01:22:06.273
Ralf Tamm?

1131
01:22:06.437 --> 01:22:08.110
Come with me.

1132
01:22:11.877 --> 01:22:12.673
We were quite surprised,

1133
01:22:12.837 --> 01:22:14.635
that there was another Estonian

1134
01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.754
with the same name in Stockholm.

1135
01:22:16.917 --> 01:22:19.272
We almost buried you.

1136
01:22:24.037 --> 01:22:25.869
What happened? 
- Bank robbery.

1137
01:22:26.037 --> 01:22:27.471
In Marbella.

1138
01:22:27.637 --> 01:22:30.311
The driver was shot
and drove off a cliff.

1139
01:22:30.477 --> 01:22:31.706
The car caught fire,

1140
01:22:31.877 --> 01:22:34.027
All burned.

1141
01:22:35.277 --> 01:22:37.951
He held this in his hand.

1142
01:22:46.157 --> 01:22:47.556
T know who he is.

1143
01:23:08.797 --> 01:23:10.834
We were about seven years old.

1144
01:23:12.277 --> 01:23:13.073
Mario came to our place,

1145
01:23:13.237 --> 01:23:14.955
when his dad was drunk again.

1146
01:23:16.957 --> 01:23:18.550
Maybe he thought about those nights,

1147
01:23:18.717 --> 01:23:20.469
behind our kitchen table,

1148
01:23:20.637 --> 01:23:22.469
when he took my identity.

1149
01:23:25.677 --> 01:23:27.031
Mom a scientist,

1150
01:23:28.037 --> 01:23:30.267
dad a working class hero.

1151
01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:34.516
The dream of a normal family.

1152
01:23:38.437 --> 01:23:40.269
His long escape from himself

1153
01:23:41.677 --> 01:23:43.270
Is now finally over.

1154
01:23:56.837 --> 01:23:58.589
Hello.

1155
01:23:58.757 --> 01:24:00.270
Yes, Rita.

1156
01:24:00.437 --> 01:24:02.110
I'll be there in the morning.

1157
01:24:03.677 --> 01:24:05.350
Yes. Alright.

1158
01:24:06.397 --> 01:24:08.035
Love you.

1159
01:25:24.397 --> 01:25:25.990
Thank you, mister.
