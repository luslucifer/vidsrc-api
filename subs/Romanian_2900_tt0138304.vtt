<b>The Astronaut's Wife
SciFi,1999</b>


3
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.692
I hate this part.

4
00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:39.695
You're still here, but I know
you're going, and I hate that.


5
00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:42.823
Well, I'll call you, baby.

6
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:44.992
Don't tease me.

7
00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:51.123
I miss you so much
when you're gone.


8
00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:53.917
I miss you, too, baby.

9
00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:55.586
Listen.

10
00:00:55.627 --> 00:00:57.504
Last time Streck told me...

11
00:00:57.546 --> 00:00:59.256
if I bellyached about you
for one more minute...


12
00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.509
he was gonna toss my ass
right off the ship.


13
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:07.848
You tell Streck
your ass belongs to me...


14
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.434
and he can keep
his hands off it.


15
00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:11.935
All right.

16
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.232
My class wants you
to come by when you get back.


17
00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.321
I think I can arrange a visit...

18
00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:24.114
if you're nice.

19
00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:27.993
How nice?

20
00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:34.833
You like fruit?

21
00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:42.091
Well...

22
00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:46.345
Come here a minute.

23
00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:47.971
Come here.

24
00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:51.016
Ain't that a peach?

25
00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:55.270
It that for me?

26
00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:56.480
That's for you.

27
00:01:58.023 --> 00:02:00.442
Victory,
this is Mission Control.


28
00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:01.819
All systems are go.

29
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.029
Flight Commander,
all computers are functioning.


30
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:05.364
The crew of Victory...

31
00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:07.199
has been given a go
for orbit operations...


32
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:08.575
by the Mission Control Center.

33
00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:10.703
Crew members are doing well...

34
00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:13.789
and all systems of the orbiter
are performing satisfactorily.


35
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:14.998
Three...

36
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.375
two...

37
00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:17.710
one...

38
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:19.712
zero, and liftoff.

39
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.174
Mission Control,
we have left the pad.


40
00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:25.342
Roger that, Victory.

41
00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:28.303
You are go for throttle up.

42
00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.596
Mission Control,
this is Victory.


43
00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:30.764
We have throttled up.

44
00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:32.933
It's a fine day fortifying,
Houston.


45
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.770
All systems are go.

46
00:02:44.778 --> 00:02:46.739
Pineapples!

47
00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:49.158
What do they have in Kansas?

48
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.784
Corn!

49
00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:55.247
Yes, corn,
and what about Georgia?


50
00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.915
What do they have in Georgia?

51
00:02:56.957 --> 00:02:58.417
Peaches!

52
00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.878
Very good.

53
00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.130
And what do we have
here in Florida?


54
00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:06.008
Oranges!

55
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.427
And rocket ships.

56
00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.430
Yes, Calvin, and rocket ships.

57
00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:14.141
Mrs. Armacost,
you have a phone call.


58
00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:15.768
Thank you, Brian.

59
00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.436
OK, let's go to page seven.

60
00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:20.439
And work quietly, OK?

61
00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:26.278
Mrs. Armacost.

62
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.113
Yes, this is Jillian Armacost.

63
00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:30.449
Mrs. Armacost,
NASA communications.


64
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.659
We have your husband for you.

65
00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:34.453
Go ahead, Commander.

66
00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:36.747
- Jillian?
- Spencer?


67
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:37.998
Yeah, I told you I'd call.

68
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.583
It's amazing, isn't it?

69
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.543
Yes, amazing.

70
00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:42.711
Hey, Jill.

71
00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:46.465
What are you wearing?

72
00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:52.221
Come on, now.
Ain't nobody else listening.


73
00:03:52.262 --> 00:03:53.722
Not exactly, Commander.

74
00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:55.349
Including Houston and JPL...

75
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:57.893
there are about 300 folks
on the line today.


76
00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:01.105
It's a nice day down there, huh?

77
00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:02.648
Beautiful.

78
00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.109
Can you see outside, Jill?

79
00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:09.655
Fifteen seconds, Commander.

80
00:04:09.738 --> 00:04:11.490
I'm right above you.

81
00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:15.327
You lookin' up, honey?

82
00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.287
Ten seconds.

83
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.499
Won't you smile for me, huh?

84
00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:22.042
I already am.

85
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:26.338
He called you from outer space?

86
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.133
Well, technically
from Earth's orbit, but yes.


87
00:04:29.174 --> 00:04:30.384
He called me from the orbiter.

88
00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:33.387
Stanley won't even call me
from the Beef 'N' Burger...


89
00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.056
and you get a call
from outer space...


90
00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:38.100
the Earth's orbit, whatever.

91
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.977
Technically speaking,
Jill, you scored.


92
00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:42.563
I don't get it.
We grew up in the same house.


93
00:04:42.604 --> 00:04:43.814
You land Johnny Rocket Boy.

94
00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:44.982
I keep getting
different versions...


95
00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:47.151
of Throws
-Up
-On
-Himself Elmo.

96
00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:51.196
I bet he's good at the little
things, too, isn't he?


97
00:04:51.238 --> 00:04:54.408
What little things?

98
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.494
Just those little things
that mean so much.


99
00:04:57.536 --> 00:04:58.996
It's true.

100
00:04:59.038 --> 00:05:01.790
You know,
men are like parking spaces.


101
00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:02.958
All the good ones are taken...

102
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.586
and all the available ones
are handicapped.


103
00:05:08.464 --> 00:05:10.007
What?

104
00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:18.974
And now back to our program.

105
00:05:19.016 --> 00:05:21.018
Oh, man, something happened.

106
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.436
Come on.

107
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.275
Keep checking.

108
00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:33.280
Mrs. Armacost,
I'm Sherman Reese from NASA.


109
00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:35.574
Um, it's about your husband.

110
00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:36.909
What's happened?

111
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.243
We'd like you to come with us.

112
00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:39.828
I have a car right outside.

113
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.747
There's something about Spencer!

114
00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.123
Please, Mrs. Armacost.

115
00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:44.750
Captain Streck's wife
is already there.


116
00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:46.627
The director wants--

117
00:05:46.668 --> 00:05:49.213
The condition of Armacost
and Streck...


118
00:05:49.254 --> 00:05:51.090
as well as the rest
of the shuttle crew...


119
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:52.674
is at this time unknown.

120
00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:54.468
Reporting live from NASA...

121
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.011
Is my husband dead?

122
00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:57.679
Ma'am, I don't know anything...

123
00:05:57.721 --> 00:05:59.098
about the condition
of your husband.


124
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.307
Is my husband dead?

125
00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.435
Ma'am, I just don't know.

126
00:06:03.477 --> 00:06:06.313
Then take me
to someone who does.


127
00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:20.619
He's dead.

128
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:21.995
I know he's dead.

129
00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:24.790
They're not dead.
They're not dead.


130
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.961
What have they told you?

131
00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:30.254
Nothing.

132
00:06:30.295 --> 00:06:31.714
They won't tell me anything.

133
00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:35.968
Mrs. Streck, Mrs. Armacost.

134
00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.304
First, your husbands are alive.

135
00:06:39.346 --> 00:06:40.472
Oh, thank God.

136
00:06:40.514 --> 00:06:41.849
They're back on the orbiter
right now...


137
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.977
and we're gonna bring 'em down
immediately.


138
00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:46.228
What happened up there?

139
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.021
Your husbands were
outside the orbiter...


140
00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:50.858
performing some repairs
on a satellite.


141
00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:52.025
There was an explosion...

142
00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:55.946
and we lost contact
with both astronauts...


143
00:06:55.988 --> 00:06:57.865
for about two minutes.

144
00:06:57.906 --> 00:07:00.117
You lost contact?

145
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.703
What do you mean
you lost contact?


146
00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:05.789
After the explosion,
they drifted behind the shuttle.


147
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:07.833
We had to bring
the craft around...


148
00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.501
a hundred and eighty degrees
to get them.


149
00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:10.669
They were all alone?

150
00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:12.713
But now they're back
on the shuttle...


151
00:07:12.755 --> 00:07:15.924
and they'll be back down here
as soon as we can manage it.


152
00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:18.218
Mr. Reese here
will stay with you...


153
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.845
until we can get you to them.

154
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:26.101
They were all alone out there,
Jillian.


155
00:07:29.521 --> 00:07:31.023
It's OK.

156
00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:32.399
They're alive.

157
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:36.737
This will give you a view
from the shuttle as they land.


158
00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.031
Would you like me
to get you the link- up?


159
00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:41.075
I'll get the link-up.

160
00:07:57.216 --> 00:08:00.427
Twenty-five seconds
to reentry interface.


161
00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:05.432
Maintain descent.

162
00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:11.146
Wind shear--
this is minimum trajectory.


163
00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:16.443
Velocity at
twenty-six hundred F.B.P.


164
00:08:19.154 --> 00:08:21.073
At two hundred
thirty-five knots...


165
00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:22.449
maintaining descent.

166
00:08:23.826 --> 00:08:25.786
Eight at two-fifteen...

167
00:08:25.828 --> 00:08:27.830
five at two-ten...

168
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:29.832
two at two hundred.

169
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.168
One foot.

170
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.087
Ground Control, this is Victory.

171
00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.463
We are down.

172
00:08:36.547 --> 00:08:38.465
He's breathing on his own.

173
00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:39.800
His vital functions are good.

174
00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:42.970
As far as we can tell, there has
been no brain damage...


175
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.513
so it should only be
a matter of time...


176
00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:46.515
before your husband
regains consciousness.


177
00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:49.977
- So he's going to be OK?
- Absolutely.


178
00:08:53.105 --> 00:08:54.398
And what about Alex?

179
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.485
Captain Streck is an older man
than your husband.


180
00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:02.573
There was a tremendous strain
on his heart.


181
00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:07.161
Natalie.

182
00:09:42.738 --> 00:09:44.364
Hey, you.

183
00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.836
I missed you so much.

184
00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:07.054
How are you?

185
00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:08.389
I'm all right.

186
00:10:09.306 --> 00:10:10.599
Yeah, I'm all right.

187
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:11.809
Good.

188
00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:14.728
I got to pee.

189
00:10:21.443 --> 00:10:23.654
I'll see what I can do for you.

190
00:10:26.698 --> 00:10:27.866
Where's Alex?

191
00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:32.413
Is he all right?

192
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:51.223
Spencer, what is that?

193
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.188
Did you feel that?

194
00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:01.233
My God, what is that?

195
00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:03.026
Honey, I'm here.

196
00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:06.280
God damn it!

197
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:07.489
What can I do?

198
00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:12.870
Jesus. Hold him.

199
00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:20.127
Help him!

200
00:11:42.357 --> 00:11:43.984
Clear!

201
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:49.156
That's it.
He's still at zero.


202
00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.116
Nothing.

203
00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:52.451
Charging, three hundred.

204
00:11:52.493 --> 00:11:54.119
Clear.

205
00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:03.754
We got him.

206
00:12:05.964 --> 00:12:07.758
Hold off on that intubator.

207
00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:12.679
Stand by with some dopamine.

208
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:14.681
Let's get an EKG prepped.

209
00:12:31.198 --> 00:12:32.449
What did you say?

210
00:12:32.491 --> 00:12:35.869
Well, I told that bloated
fast-food-eating motherfucker...


211
00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:38.455
that we'd never have gotten
a chance to be heroes...


212
00:12:38.497 --> 00:12:40.499
if he hadn't cut our budget
and forced us...


213
00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:43.168
to put that piece of shit
exploding satellite into orbit.


214
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.378
Really?

215
00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:46.672
And then what happened?

216
00:12:46.714 --> 00:12:49.883
Said he'd never been talked to
like that before by anybody...


217
00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:51.719
and I said I didn't give
a big hairy rat's ass...


218
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.347
and if he ever called me again,
I would track him down...


219
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:58.183
roust him out of his bunk, pull
his pants around his ankles...


220
00:12:58.225 --> 00:12:59.476
and spank him
with a coat hanger...


221
00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:01.478
right there in front of
his wife and children.


222
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.771
Well, that's real subtle.

223
00:13:02.813 --> 00:13:05.899
Yeah, I thought it
pretty subtle.


224
00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:07.985
You want to tell me what you
really said to the president?


225
00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:11.071
Yeah.
I thanked him for his call.


226
00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:14.158
Then I asked him
what he was wearing...


227
00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:17.161
and he started breathing
kind of heavy...


228
00:13:17.202 --> 00:13:19.079
made a funny noise, and hung up.

229
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:20.247
What do you think that means?

230
00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:21.457
Maybe he's not into you.

231
00:13:21.498 --> 00:13:22.666
I guess not.

232
00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:24.585
She got balloons.
Why didn't I get no balloons?


233
00:13:24.626 --> 00:13:25.753
Because you got candy.

234
00:13:25.794 --> 00:13:28.297
- I ain't got no candy.
- You got candy.


235
00:13:28.338 --> 00:13:30.799
- Where's my candy?
- In the car.


236
00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:35.262
Does he ever talk about it?

237
00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:38.891
Did Spencer ever say anything
about what happened up there?


238
00:13:38.932 --> 00:13:41.894
What it was like
when they were alone?


239
00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:46.273
It's going to be OK.

240
00:13:46.315 --> 00:13:47.483
They're back.

241
00:13:49.693 --> 00:13:51.153
He doesn't talk about it,
does he?


242
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.906
Neither does Alex.

243
00:13:53.947 --> 00:13:56.075
Never mentions it--

244
00:13:56.116 --> 00:13:57.576
not a word.

245
00:13:58.786 --> 00:14:00.037
Well, do you blame them?

246
00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:07.753
Those two minutes,
they almost died, Jillian.


247
00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.129
But they didn't.

248
00:14:09.171 --> 00:14:10.798
But they almost did.

249
00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:14.301
To go through that together...

250
00:14:14.343 --> 00:14:16.178
to come back,
and never talk about it...


251
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.806
never bring it up--
it's bizarre.


252
00:14:21.683 --> 00:14:23.102
It's over.

253
00:14:24.103 --> 00:14:25.270
Honey...

254
00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:29.858
I know this has to be hard
for you, too.


255
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.073
It just scares me that they act
like it never happened.


256
00:14:41.662 --> 00:14:42.788
There you go.

257
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.998
- Thanks, Commander.
- You got it, buddy.


258
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.959
Hey, Mike, what did he write?

259
00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:50.045
Guess what.

260
00:14:50.087 --> 00:14:51.255
What?

261
00:14:54.633 --> 00:14:56.635
I'm resigning from the service.

262
00:14:59.054 --> 00:15:00.723
Because of what happened?

263
00:15:00.764 --> 00:15:03.684
Well, it's because
I'm done up there.


264
00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:09.898
I got an offer
from an aerospace firm--


265
00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:11.400
executive position...

266
00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:14.653
lots of money.

267
00:15:14.695 --> 00:15:17.281
I mean boatloads of money, Jill.

268
00:15:17.322 --> 00:15:20.534
What do you know
about being an executive?


269
00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:21.910
You're a flier, Spence.

270
00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:23.495
No, honey.

271
00:15:23.537 --> 00:15:26.248
What I am
is a true American hero.


272
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.792
The president of
the United States said that...


273
00:15:28.834 --> 00:15:30.085
and you heard it.

274
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:33.547
Anyway...

275
00:15:35.007 --> 00:15:37.259
Apparently,
it's pretty good for business...


276
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:41.096
to have a true American hero
on the company letter head.


277
00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:48.187
The thing of it is, Jill...

278
00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:51.065
is that the company
headquarters...


279
00:15:54.276 --> 00:15:56.278
it's in New York City.

280
00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.907
You're kidding, right?

281
00:15:59.948 --> 00:16:02.451
New York?

282
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:04.453
You hate New York.

283
00:16:04.453 --> 00:16:05.704
Too many people, remember?

284
00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:07.081
I know.

285
00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:12.753
We have a life here, Spencer--

286
00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:16.173
my job, our friends, everything.

287
00:16:20.636 --> 00:16:23.013
So, what do you say?

288
00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:24.556
Will you do it?

289
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.187
Will you move
to New York City with me?


290
00:16:32.564 --> 00:16:35.067
You've always been there for me.

291
00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:39.029
I want to be there for you.

292
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.242
Let's go to New York.

293
00:16:45.035 --> 00:16:47.037
What do you say?

294
00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:53.168
Yes, Paula?

295
00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:56.714
When your husband is in space,
does he ever see God?


296
00:16:56.755 --> 00:16:59.883
What about aliens?
Does he see aliens?


297
00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:03.053
Does he bring a laser gun
in case there are aliens?


298
00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:04.888
lf I were going,
I'd bring two laser guns--


299
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.266
a little one for my pocket
and a laser rifle.


300
00:17:07.307 --> 00:17:09.059
Does your husband
have a laser rifle?


301
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:10.728
Does he get to bring it
home with him?


302
00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:12.396
Does it work here
on Earth or only in space?


303
00:17:14.022 --> 00:17:15.149
You know what, Calvin?

304
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.734
What, Mrs. Armacost?

305
00:17:16.775 --> 00:17:18.652
I'm going to miss you.

306
00:17:28.037 --> 00:17:31.331
And so I face

307
00:17:31.373 --> 00:17:34.668
The final curtain

308
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.296
My friends

309
00:17:37.337 --> 00:17:40.174
I must say it clear

310
00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:43.218
I'll state my case

311
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.638
Of which I'm certain

312
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.183
I've lived

313
00:17:49.224 --> 00:17:51.310
A life that's full

314
00:17:51.393 --> 00:17:54.188
I traveled each

315
00:17:54.229 --> 00:17:55.355
Ain't the world incredible?

316
00:17:55.397 --> 00:17:58.108
And every highway

317
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.861
And more

318
00:18:00.903 --> 00:18:03.864
Much more than this

319
00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:05.199
He did it

320
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.287
His way

321
00:18:27.763 --> 00:18:28.931
Thank you.

322
00:18:45.072 --> 00:18:47.741
To you, spaceman.

323
00:20:35.516 --> 00:20:36.767
Baby?

324
00:21:09.007 --> 00:21:10.718
I have a brief
prepared statement...


325
00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:12.803
and then there will be time
for questions.


326
00:21:12.845 --> 00:21:16.849
Captain Alex Streck died
last night at eight fifty-five.


327
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.058
The cause of death...

328
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.394
has been determined
to have been a massive stroke--


329
00:21:20.436 --> 00:21:23.355
what the surgeons are calling
a severe insult to the brain.


330
00:21:23.397 --> 00:21:25.357
Alex was an asset
to this program...


331
00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:27.401
way beyond
his professional expertise.


332
00:21:27.443 --> 00:21:30.237
He will be missed terribly
by all of us.


333
00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.739
There will be
a private ceremony.


334
00:21:34.032 --> 00:21:36.035
Is Commander Armacost
in any danger?


335
00:21:36.076 --> 00:21:38.495
I'll let Dr. Patraba
answer that.


336
00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:41.915
Commander Armacost
has been through...


337
00:21:41.957 --> 00:21:44.752
an intensive array
of examinations and tests.


338
00:21:44.793 --> 00:21:46.920
It is the opinion of myself
and my colleagues...


339
00:21:46.962 --> 00:21:50.591
that he's in no more danger
than any of us.


340
00:22:07.232 --> 00:22:08.984
I'm going to be over here, baby.

341
00:22:10.778 --> 00:22:11.945
You OK?

342
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:14.907
Where's Natalie?

343
00:22:14.948 --> 00:22:17.368
She's in the back.
She's been asking for you.


344
00:22:17.409 --> 00:22:19.870
OK. I'll see you in a bit, OK?

345
00:22:19.912 --> 00:22:21.914
- All right.
- OK.


346
00:22:52.194 --> 00:22:54.863
They talked to him every night.

347
00:22:56.407 --> 00:22:57.908
All the time.

348
00:23:01.537 --> 00:23:03.163
I couldn’t understand them.

349
00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:08.377
Who talked to him, Natalie?

350
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:14.842
They did.

351
00:23:18.262 --> 00:23:19.805
They did, Jillian.

352
00:24:02.097 --> 00:24:04.016
He's hiding inside me.

353
00:24:19.948 --> 00:24:22.326
I certainly do appreciate
your concern, Mr. Reese...


354
00:24:22.368 --> 00:24:25.746
but I have been probed and poked
by enough needles...


355
00:24:25.788 --> 00:24:27.748
and your superiors have given me
a clean bill of health.


356
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.334
I know that, but, Commander, I--

357
00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:32.086
It's probably nothing, but...

358
00:24:32.127 --> 00:24:34.380
Do your bosses know
you want to do this?


359
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:53.607
Oh, God.

360
00:25:21.135 --> 00:25:22.761
I'll be sure and let you know...

361
00:25:22.803 --> 00:25:24.763
of some good places
for you to shop.


362
00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:28.225
That dress is really sweet,
but it's not really appropriate.


363
00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:32.104
You'll meet lots of interesting
people when you're here.


364
00:25:32.146 --> 00:25:34.273
They like
the sort of things I do.


365
00:25:34.314 --> 00:25:35.441
You can feel the first kick.

366
00:25:35.482 --> 00:25:38.819
Probably not quite
as interesting as me...


367
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:40.654
but you're very lucky.
I, uh...


368
00:25:40.696 --> 00:25:44.825
But then she saw
the rocket boosters come on...


369
00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:47.786
and that's when you know...

370
00:25:47.828 --> 00:25:49.496
that you're going somewhere
real fast.


371
00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:51.498
- Zoom, zoom, zoom.
- That's right.


372
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.169
I used to be into AIDS,
but now I'm into hunger.


373
00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:00.424
I teach.

374
00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:02.468
Oh, at the university?

375
00:26:03.594 --> 00:26:06.013
No, second grade.

376
00:26:06.055 --> 00:26:08.682
I'm sorry. I thought you said
you taught second grade.


377
00:26:08.724 --> 00:26:09.933
Yes. I--

378
00:26:09.975 --> 00:26:12.269
Oh, Ambrose, hi.

379
00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:13.645
You look great.

380
00:26:13.687 --> 00:26:14.980
Will you excuse me?

381
00:26:15.022 --> 00:26:16.648
Yeah, sure.

382
00:26:33.916 --> 00:26:35.417
Yeah, all right.

383
00:26:35.459 --> 00:26:36.960
Excuse me, Philip.

384
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.883
Now, don't worry about her.

385
00:26:42.925 --> 00:26:46.845
Total lack of body fat has made
her something less than human.


386
00:26:46.887 --> 00:26:49.306
I don't think she's had
her period in three years...


387
00:26:49.348 --> 00:26:50.724
which I guess is a blessing...

388
00:26:50.766 --> 00:26:53.185
for the gene pool,
wouldn’t you say?


389
00:26:53.227 --> 00:26:54.436
Shelly McLaren.

390
00:26:55.854 --> 00:26:57.356
Yeah, I know.

391
00:27:00.442 --> 00:27:01.568
Your husband must be--

392
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.320
Jackson McLaren.

393
00:27:03.362 --> 00:27:05.656
They all had cigars...

394
00:27:05.697 --> 00:27:08.867
but Jackson had
the biggest cigar of all.


395
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:10.327
Ah, here we go.

396
00:27:14.331 --> 00:27:15.749
Do you have many friends
here in the city?


397
00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:20.045
Yeah, some-- at work,
and Spencer, of course.


398
00:27:20.963 --> 00:27:23.549
What?
Your husband and your friend?


399
00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:27.219
Well, you better not
let that get around.


400
00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:30.889
You know, they’re going
to haul you up on charges.


401
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:32.266
That, I like.

402
00:27:32.307 --> 00:27:33.434
What?

403
00:27:33.475 --> 00:27:34.601
Your laugh.

404
00:27:34.643 --> 00:27:37.104
That's an honest laugh.

405
00:27:37.146 --> 00:27:40.065
It's been a while
since I've heard one.


406
00:27:40.107 --> 00:27:41.358
Thank you.

407
00:27:42.609 --> 00:27:44.319
It's all right.
I'll be right there.


408
00:27:44.361 --> 00:27:46.989
Apparently, there's some
minor disaster in the kitchen--


409
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.907
something to do
with burning rum balls.


410
00:27:48.949 --> 00:27:50.576
I'm going to call you...

411
00:27:50.617 --> 00:27:52.870
and we're going to go out
and laugh, all right?


412
00:27:53.954 --> 00:27:55.205
All right.

413
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:28.155
You all right?

414
00:28:28.197 --> 00:28:29.823
I'm drunk.

415
00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:33.952
Well, that’s good, honey.

416
00:28:38.582 --> 00:28:39.750
That's good.

417
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.174
Tell me what happened up there.

418
00:28:50.177 --> 00:28:51.345
Tell me.

419
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.068
All right.

420
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:08.821
Let's take a walk.

421
00:29:28.382 --> 00:29:30.342
You want to know what happened?

422
00:29:34.805 --> 00:29:36.306
Let me tell you.

423
00:29:42.354 --> 00:29:45.733
Do you want to know
about them two minutes?


424
00:29:45.774 --> 00:29:47.776
You never talk about it.

425
00:29:55.284 --> 00:29:56.452
Two minutes--

426
00:29:58.203 --> 00:29:59.371
dark...

427
00:30:00.706 --> 00:30:01.874
black...

428
00:30:03.709 --> 00:30:04.877
no light.

429
00:30:07.463 --> 00:30:09.757
There was an explosion...

430
00:30:09.798 --> 00:30:11.091
and, um...

431
00:30:12.468 --> 00:30:14.011
everything shut down.

432
00:30:15.262 --> 00:30:16.430
No light...

433
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:18.932
no communication.

434
00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:22.269
It was black...

435
00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:23.437
silent.

436
00:30:25.898 --> 00:30:27.900
No sound, but...

437
00:30:27.983 --> 00:30:30.235
but loud-- something loud.

438
00:30:30.277 --> 00:30:31.445
Loud nothing.

439
00:30:32.613 --> 00:30:36.283
And it was cold.
It was so cold, Jill.


440
00:30:36.325 --> 00:30:39.328
And I knew what that cold was.

441
00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:42.247
It was death...

442
00:30:43.874 --> 00:30:46.919
and it held me real tight
for about the first minute.


443
00:30:47.002 --> 00:30:48.128
And then...

444
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:52.591
I felt warmth.

445
00:30:53.717 --> 00:30:56.762
It was the warmth
of your vagina...


446
00:30:56.845 --> 00:30:58.806
the warmth of your body...

447
00:30:58.847 --> 00:30:59.973
your hands...

448
00:31:02.101 --> 00:31:04.686
The inside of your mouth...

449
00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:07.147
the warmth of your come...

450
00:31:07.189 --> 00:31:10.484
the warmth from inside you,
Jillian--


451
00:31:10.526 --> 00:31:12.319
your warmth.

452
00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:17.282
I felt it all around me.

453
00:31:18.492 --> 00:31:19.952
It made me breathe.

454
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.503
It made me breathe.

455
00:32:38.447 --> 00:32:39.573
What's happening?

456
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:02.406
What are you doing?

457
00:34:04.992 --> 00:34:08.787
I couldn’t sleep,
so I was just...


458
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:11.081
Listening to some music.

459
00:34:32.978 --> 00:34:35.981
I'm sorry if I was a bit rough.

460
00:34:36.023 --> 00:34:39.693
I guess maybe I had
a little too much to drink.


461
00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:48.911
Come on, let’s go to bed.

462
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:07.721
Good night, sweetheart.

463
00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:49.179
"Then she began to guess
the little man's name.


464
00:35:49.221 --> 00:35:52.266
"'Is it Conrad Peppermill?'
she said...


465
00:35:52.307 --> 00:35:54.268
"And the little man said..."

466
00:35:57.354 --> 00:36:00.816
"'I know, I know.
It's Sir William Doorknob...'


467
00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:02.776
"and the little man said..."

468
00:36:05.779 --> 00:36:07.239
"'I have it.

469
00:36:07.281 --> 00:36:09.950
"It must be
little Ribs of Beef...'


470
00:36:09.992 --> 00:36:11.827
"and the little man said..."

471
00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:17.916
"'It couldn’t be
Rumple stilt skin, could it?'"


472
00:36:19.209 --> 00:36:21.712
"'What did you say?'
said the little man.


473
00:36:21.754 --> 00:36:23.964
"'I said it couldn’t be...'"

474
00:36:23.964 --> 00:36:27.468
Rumple stilt skin!

475
00:36:27.509 --> 00:36:29.053
"And the little man
screamed..."


476
00:36:30.763 --> 00:36:32.556
"and stamped his foot."

477
00:36:44.318 --> 00:36:46.695
Honey, you sound so sad.

478
00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:48.280
It's just the city, Nan.

479
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.618
It just gets inside you,
that's all.


480
00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:54.286
You can't let it.

481
00:36:54.328 --> 00:36:56.830
That's how you got in trouble
after Mom and Dad died...


482
00:36:56.872 --> 00:37:00.334
and you sound like you did then.

483
00:37:00.334 --> 00:37:04.046
Have you found a doctor
to talk to yet?


484
00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:05.881
Uh-uh.
Not yet.


485
00:37:07.257 --> 00:37:08.801
Promise me something, OK?

486
00:37:08.884 --> 00:37:11.804
lf it gets like it was before...

487
00:37:11.845 --> 00:37:14.181
that you’ll find
someone to talk to.


488
00:37:16.016 --> 00:37:18.352
Nan, I really have to go, OK?

489
00:37:22.606 --> 00:37:23.774
You're late.

490
00:37:25.192 --> 00:37:26.860
You didn't get my message?

491
00:37:26.902 --> 00:37:28.862
I had a dinner meeting tonight.

492
00:37:28.904 --> 00:37:30.781
No.
I didn't check the machine yet.


493
00:37:30.823 --> 00:37:33.117
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

494
00:37:33.158 --> 00:37:36.745
I still ain't conquered
this corporate shit yet.


495
00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:38.872
I'm going to take
a shower, honey.


496
00:38:42.394 --> 00:38:43.896
Do you ever think...

497
00:38:43.979 --> 00:38:46.231
what if I had a F-Fifteen
in World War II...


498
00:38:46.273 --> 00:38:48.025
or a B
-Seventeen in World War I?

499
00:38:48.067 --> 00:38:49.193
No, never.

500
00:38:49.234 --> 00:38:50.861
What kind of ass I could kick...

501
00:38:50.903 --> 00:38:52.404
if I had that type
of advanced technology?


502
00:38:52.446 --> 00:38:54.907
And how many different kinds
of ass are there?


503
00:38:54.948 --> 00:38:57.326
Many kinds, love...

504
00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.203
but the modern battlefield
is all electronic...


505
00:38:59.244 --> 00:39:02.081
and the fighter that this man
has helped us design...


506
00:39:02.122 --> 00:39:05.793
can detect, sort, identify,
and eliminate...


507
00:39:05.834 --> 00:39:07.086
anything electronic.

508
00:39:07.127 --> 00:39:08.879
You got two McLaren engines...

509
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:11.799
pumping twenty-five thousand
pounds of thrust...


510
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.967
wingspan of seventy-five feet.

511
00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:15.302
Fully extended.

512
00:39:15.344 --> 00:39:17.554
Oh, yeah, that's fully extended.

513
00:39:17.596 --> 00:39:19.973
You got a top speed of eighteen
hundred miles per hour...


514
00:39:20.015 --> 00:39:22.476
a ceiling
of fifty-five thousand feet...


515
00:39:22.518 --> 00:39:24.978
and a crew of two.

516
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.731
The modern battlefield
is a blizzard--


517
00:39:27.773 --> 00:39:30.484
a transparent,
electronic blizzard...


518
00:39:30.484 --> 00:39:32.403
with planes and tanks...

519
00:39:32.444 --> 00:39:35.656
and computers and missiles
all humming away--


520
00:39:35.697 --> 00:39:39.034
and into that storm
flies our fighter.


521
00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.327
It doesn't drop bombs.

522
00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:42.162
It doesn't shoot missiles.

523
00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:43.414
It just sends out a signal.

524
00:39:44.832 --> 00:39:46.417
It's like the voice of God.

525
00:39:46.458 --> 00:39:49.503
It's just a signal
that turns everything off.


526
00:39:49.545 --> 00:39:52.923
I forget, Jackson--
who is the enemy now...


527
00:39:52.965 --> 00:39:55.300
that we need your plane
to defend us from?


528
00:39:55.342 --> 00:39:56.760
The enemy at this moment?

529
00:39:56.802 --> 00:39:59.221
You are, dear.
You are.


530
00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:04.685
The signal it makes--
what does it sound like?


531
00:40:04.685 --> 00:40:06.937
Oh, humans can't hear it, dove.

532
00:40:06.979 --> 00:40:09.773
Humans can't hear it at all.

533
00:40:09.815 --> 00:40:11.066
Excuse me, a moment.

534
00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.276
Miss Augusta
would like to see you.


535
00:40:12.317 --> 00:40:13.861
Oh, all right.
Come on, Jackson.


536
00:40:13.902 --> 00:40:16.029
Augusta has summoned us
to her bedside.


537
00:40:16.071 --> 00:40:17.781
It's the good-night kiss.

538
00:40:17.823 --> 00:40:19.450
After allowance...

539
00:40:19.491 --> 00:40:22.703
it's the most important event
of the day.


540
00:40:22.703 --> 00:40:24.288
The joys of parenthood.

541
00:40:24.329 --> 00:40:25.456
Come on, Jackson.

542
00:40:25.497 --> 00:40:26.665
Coming.

543
00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:51.690
Why are you so far away?

544
00:40:51.732 --> 00:40:53.692
I'm right here.

545
00:40:53.734 --> 00:40:55.903
What's the matter?

546
00:40:55.944 --> 00:40:57.446
What's wrong?

547
00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:00.282
I don't understand any of this.

548
00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:01.867
What they're talking about...

549
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.619
it's like they're
speaking in code.


550
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.996
Honey,
it's business, that’s all.


551
00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:09.541
Why do you have
to build that plane?


552
00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:13.337
The way you talk about it,
it doesn't even sound like you.


553
00:41:13.379 --> 00:41:15.672
Baby, it's my job.

554
00:41:15.714 --> 00:41:16.924
My job.

555
00:41:18.467 --> 00:41:22.096
You used to say
you'd fly forever.


556
00:41:22.137 --> 00:41:27.101
You used to say they'd have
to bury you in the sky.


557
00:41:27.142 --> 00:41:28.811
Yeah.
They almost did.


558
00:41:36.568 --> 00:41:39.780
What are you looking for
when you look at me like that?


559
00:41:39.822 --> 00:41:42.324
What are you hiding from me?

560
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:48.247
Nothing.

561
00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:14.189
This is going to be
a little cold.


562
00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:21.405
Let's have a look in here,
shall we?


563
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:24.950
Ah, there it is.

564
00:42:26.326 --> 00:42:27.494
Let's take a measurement.

565
00:42:31.707 --> 00:42:35.502
Nine weeks,
give or take a few days.


566
00:42:35.502 --> 00:42:37.379
See this here?

567
00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.922
This flickering?

568
00:42:38.964 --> 00:42:40.090
What is that?

569
00:42:40.132 --> 00:42:41.633
That's the heartbeat.

570
00:42:46.013 --> 00:42:48.015
Is it supposed to be
moving that fast?


571
00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:52.644
I would be worried
if it were not.


572
00:42:52.686 --> 00:42:54.646
Everything looks fine, Jillian.

573
00:42:58.734 --> 00:42:59.902
Well, that’s interesting.

574
00:43:01.695 --> 00:43:02.863
What?

575
00:43:04.239 --> 00:43:05.449
Well, wait.
I'm not sure.


576
00:43:10.996 --> 00:43:12.998
See this here?

577
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.625
What is that?

578
00:43:14.666 --> 00:43:16.794
A second heartbeat.

579
00:43:16.835 --> 00:43:18.337
Two heartbeats.

580
00:43:20.381 --> 00:43:22.716
It's twins, Mrs. Armacost--

581
00:43:22.716 --> 00:43:23.884
twins.

582
00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:32.684
This is a number
of a support group...


583
00:43:32.726 --> 00:43:35.229
for women who are
expecting twins.


584
00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:41.110
There's something
I didn't tell you...


585
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:42.319
for my chart.

586
00:43:44.029 --> 00:43:45.948
I know I should’ve, but...

587
00:43:47.366 --> 00:43:50.369
A few years ago,
after my parents died...


588
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:52.538
I...

589
00:43:56.417 --> 00:43:58.168
I had a bad time.

590
00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:00.754
How bad, Jillian?

591
00:44:04.466 --> 00:44:06.969
I would see people I knew...

592
00:44:09.263 --> 00:44:10.556
I would see them dead.

593
00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:14.268
And sometimes, I...

594
00:44:16.061 --> 00:44:17.855
I would see myself.

595
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.235
Did you seek treatment?

596
00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:27.072
Were you hospitalized?

597
00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:37.875
Does he know?

598
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.421
He's the one
that got me through it.


599
00:44:42.463 --> 00:44:45.841
You are afraid...

600
00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.134
that this pregnancy...

601
00:44:47.176 --> 00:44:49.470
is going to bring
all that back, right?


602
00:44:52.473 --> 00:44:54.516
Spend time with Spencer.

603
00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:56.101
Go through this together.

604
00:44:56.143 --> 00:44:57.561
Now that you know...

605
00:44:57.603 --> 00:44:59.563
that all these feelings
you've been having...


606
00:44:59.605 --> 00:45:01.774
are caused by the life
growing in you...


607
00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:06.653
and by your body adapting to it,
oh, cherish it.


608
00:45:07.696 --> 00:45:11.992
And if you need,
call me any time, day or night.


609
00:45:12.034 --> 00:45:13.619
Thank you.

610
00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.484
Just a nightmare, baby.

611
00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:49.488
You were talking in your sleep.

612
00:45:51.323 --> 00:45:52.533
What was I saying?

613
00:45:52.574 --> 00:45:54.827
Couldn’t tell.

614
00:45:54.868 --> 00:45:57.705
It didn't sound like words,
really.


615
00:45:57.746 --> 00:45:59.039
It was more like sounds.

616
00:46:00.582 --> 00:46:02.000
I'm scared.

617
00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:06.880
Well, I think it'd be strange...

618
00:46:08.048 --> 00:46:10.676
if a first-time mother
wasn't scared, honey.


619
00:46:16.432 --> 00:46:18.475
Come on.
Come with me.


620
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:22.896
There you go.

621
00:46:22.938 --> 00:46:25.315
That's better, ain't it?

622
00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:35.826
Everything's going
to be OK, isn't it?


623
00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:40.998
Everything's going
to be just fine, honey.


624
00:46:42.249 --> 00:46:44.209
And they're going
to be healthy, right?


625
00:46:45.419 --> 00:46:48.213
They're going to be beautiful,
just like their mother.


626
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.595
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?


627
00:46:54.636 --> 00:46:56.180
What are they going to be?

628
00:46:57.473 --> 00:47:00.184
Shit, they going to be
pilots, honey.


629
00:47:00.225 --> 00:47:04.021
Just like their father.

630
00:47:05.272 --> 00:47:07.357
All right, lean back here.

631
00:47:07.399 --> 00:47:09.401
Let me wash your hair.

632
00:47:17.993 --> 00:47:19.870
Am I dreaming, Spencer?

633
00:47:27.086 --> 00:47:28.712
No, you’re not dreaming.

634
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.468
And then he gives you
that look--


635
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:37.971
that "honey, I understand" look.

636
00:47:38.013 --> 00:47:39.807
I don't care how long
he rubs my feet for.


637
00:47:39.848 --> 00:47:42.393
He doesn't understand a thing.

638
00:47:42.434 --> 00:47:43.644
He rubs your feet?

639
00:47:43.644 --> 00:47:46.647
I know what you mean.

640
00:47:46.688 --> 00:47:48.941
We're supposed to be going
through this together...


641
00:47:48.982 --> 00:47:51.985
but I have never felt
more separate from him.


642
00:47:52.027 --> 00:47:53.904
It's like there's something
going on in my body...


643
00:47:53.946 --> 00:47:56.448
he knows nothing about.

644
00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.242
He rubs your feet?

645
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.579
I get into the bathtub
with my socks on.


646
00:49:25.204 --> 00:49:27.039
Aah!
Oh, my God!


647
00:49:28.749 --> 00:49:30.959
Jesus, you scared me.

648
00:49:35.547 --> 00:49:37.883
You are in big trouble.

649
00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:40.552
Do you like the pie?

650
00:49:41.762 --> 00:49:44.348
I don't believe I can take
much more of this, honey.


651
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:45.766
How much do you like the pie?

652
00:49:48.977 --> 00:49:50.187
Come get the pie.

653
00:49:50.229 --> 00:49:53.482
First, I'm going to drink you,
then I'm going to eat you.


654
00:49:53.524 --> 00:49:54.650
Get the pie.

655
00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:56.693
I'm going to eat that, right?

656
00:49:58.112 --> 00:49:59.822
Think you can handle
all three of us?


657
00:50:00.823 --> 00:50:01.949
Do you love the belly?

658
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.117
I love it.

659
00:50:03.158 --> 00:50:05.244
Good, 'cause
I love the belly, too.


660
00:50:13.419 --> 00:50:14.837
Excuse me.

661
00:50:26.181 --> 00:50:29.977
Do you remember me?

662
00:50:41.947 --> 00:50:44.283
- How many months?
- Just a few.


663
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.410
I need to speak with you.

664
00:50:47.536 --> 00:50:50.622
Spencer works for McLaren now,
if you're looking for him.


665
00:50:50.664 --> 00:50:55.169
No, I need to speak with you,
Mrs. Armacost...


666
00:50:57.504 --> 00:50:59.631
about those two minutes.

667
00:50:59.673 --> 00:51:02.760
The two minutes, Mrs. Armacost.

668
00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:04.970
What is it, Mr. Reese?

669
00:51:05.012 --> 00:51:08.307
Have you noticed any change
in your husband's behavior...


670
00:51:08.348 --> 00:51:09.600
since the shuttle mission?

671
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:13.103
I've been through these files,
and there are peculiarities.


672
00:51:13.145 --> 00:51:14.313
Like right here.

673
00:51:14.354 --> 00:51:15.856
This is your husband's
signature...


674
00:51:15.898 --> 00:51:17.524
before he went on the shuttle
that last time...


675
00:51:17.566 --> 00:51:19.526
and here's a form
that he signed when he returned.


676
00:51:19.526 --> 00:51:23.530
Now, they are similar,
but not the same.


677
00:51:23.572 --> 00:51:25.532
Not the same signature.

678
00:51:25.574 --> 00:51:29.203
Mr. Reese, are you in New York
on official NASA business?


679
00:51:29.244 --> 00:51:31.330
And here's the results
of the medical tests...


680
00:51:31.372 --> 00:51:33.123
that we ran when he got back.

681
00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:37.711
Are you on official
NASA business?


682
00:51:37.711 --> 00:51:39.046
Everything is fine.

683
00:51:39.088 --> 00:51:40.672
Everything shows up normal...

684
00:51:40.714 --> 00:51:42.841
but everything's just
a little bit different--


685
00:51:42.883 --> 00:51:44.218
blood levels...

686
00:51:44.218 --> 00:51:45.886
temperature, EKG, EEG.

687
00:51:45.928 --> 00:51:48.931
Everything's just a little off
from what it was. Look.


688
00:51:50.849 --> 00:51:52.726
Does NASA know you're here?

689
00:51:54.937 --> 00:51:56.480
They wouldn’t listen.

690
00:51:56.522 --> 00:51:59.316
They terminated my employment.

691
00:52:03.445 --> 00:52:05.406
I have to go now.

692
00:52:05.447 --> 00:52:10.661
lf you have anything to say,
call my husband at McLaren.


693
00:52:10.703 --> 00:52:13.330
I showed them the facts, and
they terminated my employment.


694
00:52:13.372 --> 00:52:14.748
They referred me
to a psychiatrist.


695
00:52:15.582 --> 00:52:16.750
Don’t follow me.

696
00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.879
I've seen Captain Streck's
autopsy report.


697
00:52:20.921 --> 00:52:23.006
It was a massive stroke.
His system overloaded.


698
00:52:23.048 --> 00:52:24.758
His body couldn’t stand
the strain.


699
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.803
I've seen Natalie Streck's
autopsy report as well.


700
00:52:30.431 --> 00:52:32.641
That was a suicide.
She killed herself.


701
00:52:32.683 --> 00:52:33.809
I was there.
I saw it.


702
00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:35.894
Yeah, she did,
but according to the report...


703
00:52:35.936 --> 00:52:39.898
when she killed herself,
she was three weeks pregnant.


704
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:41.191
What did you say?

705
00:52:41.233 --> 00:52:42.443
She probably conceived...

706
00:52:42.484 --> 00:52:43.861
right after her husband
left the hospital.


707
00:52:43.902 --> 00:52:45.529
She was pregnant, Mrs. Armacost.

708
00:52:46.947 --> 00:52:49.074
What happened
during those two minutes...


709
00:52:49.116 --> 00:52:50.743
when they were alone?

710
00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:52.911
The suits that your husband
and Captain Streck wore...


711
00:52:52.953 --> 00:52:55.289
had built-in recorders.
Listen to the voices.


712
00:52:55.289 --> 00:52:57.624
Something happened that scared
the shit out of them.


713
00:52:57.666 --> 00:52:59.460
What could do that?

714
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.796
No. It was an accident.
There was an explosion, and--


715
00:53:02.796 --> 00:53:04.798
No!
They trained for explosions.


716
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.133
They trained for accidents.

717
00:53:06.175 --> 00:53:07.301
They trained
for hundreds of hours.


718
00:53:07.342 --> 00:53:08.844
lf something goes wrong,
they have a plan.


719
00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:10.471
They don't panic.
They don't deviate.


720
00:53:10.512 --> 00:53:12.264
They stick to the plan.
That's what they do.


721
00:53:12.306 --> 00:53:13.766
Something happened out there...

722
00:53:13.807 --> 00:53:16.643
that these two men
had not trained for.


723
00:53:16.643 --> 00:53:19.480
What would do that to two
highly-trained astronauts?


724
00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:20.981
Scare them like that?

725
00:53:20.981 --> 00:53:23.984
Can you swear to me
that he's still your husband?


726
00:53:25.319 --> 00:53:28.155
Let go of me, Mr. Reese.

727
00:53:28.197 --> 00:53:29.656
Is this man bothering you?

728
00:53:33.952 --> 00:53:35.120
Yes, he is.

729
00:53:35.162 --> 00:53:39.208
You know, don't you?
You already know.


730
00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:41.585
Room three-oh-four, Nesbit Arms,
Mrs. Armacost.


731
00:53:41.627 --> 00:53:43.212
Please, Mrs. Armacost!

732
00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:48.509
OK. Settle down.
Just settle down.


733
00:53:51.887 --> 00:53:54.515
I'm going to rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees.


734
00:53:54.556 --> 00:53:56.058
You got me, Alex?

735
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.351
Spencer, what is that?

736
00:53:57.351 --> 00:53:58.977
Did you feel that?

737
00:53:59.019 --> 00:54:00.187
Spencer, what is that?

738
00:54:04.358 --> 00:54:07.194
Oh, Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?!


739
00:54:43.522 --> 00:54:45.899
I'm looking for the pregnant
woman in 24-F.


740
00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:50.904
Jillian, what’s wrong?

741
00:54:52.865 --> 00:54:55.868
He said she must have
gotten pregnant right...


742
00:54:55.909 --> 00:54:57.870
right after Alex got back.

743
00:54:57.911 --> 00:54:59.663
Did he say anything else?

744
00:54:59.705 --> 00:55:02.416
Oh, God, Nan.

745
00:55:02.416 --> 00:55:06.170
The last thing you need
to worry about is that freak.


746
00:55:06.211 --> 00:55:08.047
Just have Spencer call someone.

747
00:55:08.088 --> 00:55:09.339
No, Nan.

748
00:55:11.592 --> 00:55:13.719
Spencer can't know about this.

749
00:55:13.761 --> 00:55:15.888
But, Jillian,
you said he looked crazy.


750
00:55:15.929 --> 00:55:21.602
You have to promise me
you won't tell Spencer.


751
00:55:21.602 --> 00:55:23.020
Please promise me.

752
00:55:23.062 --> 00:55:25.856
You can't keep these things
bottled inside you, Jillian.


753
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:30.611
You're right.

754
00:55:35.866 --> 00:55:38.827
lf he bothers me again...

755
00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:42.915
I'll tell Spencer, OK?
Deal?


756
00:55:48.295 --> 00:55:50.130
Your table’s ready.

757
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:52.966
Oh, great. All right.
Let's go sit down.


758
00:55:55.761 --> 00:55:59.473
Stan? This year's grand marshal
at the parade of losers?


759
00:55:59.515 --> 00:56:00.724
He's gone.

760
00:56:00.766 --> 00:56:03.477
We can't all be as lucky
as Jill here.


761
00:56:03.477 --> 00:56:05.479
Oh, no.
It's me that's lucky.


762
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:13.487
You all right, honey?
What's the matter?


763
00:56:16.031 --> 00:56:17.324
What's the matter, honey?

764
00:56:17.366 --> 00:56:18.492
You all right?

765
00:56:18.534 --> 00:56:20.744
Just a little hot.

766
00:56:22.496 --> 00:56:25.249
Why don't you have some water?

767
00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:30.879
I think I'm gonna go home.

768
00:56:41.682 --> 00:56:44.852
All right.

769
00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:18.010
Feeling better?

770
00:57:26.018 --> 00:57:27.144
Where's Nan?

771
00:57:27.186 --> 00:57:28.937
She went out.

772
00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:32.066
It's after midnight.

773
00:57:32.107 --> 00:57:35.069
She's young, Jill.
She's having fun.


774
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:39.948
Don't you remember
when we used to have fun?


775
00:57:47.331 --> 00:57:49.083
You don't remember that, huh?

776
00:57:54.546 --> 00:57:57.257
All right.

777
00:57:57.299 --> 00:57:58.759
What's wrong with you?

778
00:57:58.801 --> 00:58:01.887
You ever think about
what happened to Alex?


779
00:58:01.929 --> 00:58:04.056
Oh, shit.

780
00:58:04.098 --> 00:58:06.058
What happened to Natalie?

781
00:58:09.937 --> 00:58:11.897
I do, all the time.

782
00:58:13.107 --> 00:58:15.442
Those two minutes
you could have died.


783
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.864
Why do you want to
go back there?


784
00:58:20.906 --> 00:58:23.492
Why do you want to
go back to that?


785
00:58:25.077 --> 00:58:28.789
Can't you just try for once
to be happy? Just once?


786
00:58:44.638 --> 00:58:47.975
I'm gonna go to sleep.

787
00:59:08.203 --> 00:59:10.289
It's Jillian Armacost.

788
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:13.542
The autopsy
on Natalie Streck...


789
00:59:13.584 --> 00:59:15.711
what did it say
about the baby?


790
00:59:19.006 --> 00:59:21.008
Not on the phone,
Mrs. Armacost.


791
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.011
No, you don't understand.
You have to tell me.


792
00:59:24.053 --> 00:59:27.181
What did Natalie’s autopsy
say about the baby?


793
00:59:27.222 --> 00:59:28.557
Babies.

794
00:59:32.478 --> 00:59:33.979
What?

795
00:59:34.021 --> 00:59:38.150
Natalie Streck was pregnant
with twins, Mrs. Armacost.


796
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:42.946
Oh, my God.

797
00:59:45.532 --> 00:59:47.284
What's happening to me?

798
00:59:47.326 --> 00:59:49.953
You are, too, aren't you?

799
00:59:52.456 --> 00:59:54.333
Pregnant with his twins?

800
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:58.170
Natalie’s babies...

801
01:00:02.716 --> 01:00:05.135
What did the autopsy say
about them?


802
01:00:05.177 --> 01:00:07.096
There's something I...

803
01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.431
I need to show you,
Mrs. Armacost.


804
01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:11.141
Something you need to see.

805
01:00:11.183 --> 01:00:15.396
Do you know the story
of the princess...


806
01:00:15.396 --> 01:00:18.816
whose beloved prince
dies in battle?


807
01:00:18.857 --> 01:00:24.071
Mrs. Armacost, I have something
you need to see.


808
01:00:24.071 --> 01:00:25.697
Do you understand me?

809
01:00:30.911 --> 01:00:32.871
The enemy prince...

810
01:00:34.456 --> 01:00:36.625
after overrunning
the castle...


811
01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:43.424
finds the princess
and forces himself upon her.


812
01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.222
Months later,
the princess is with child.


813
01:00:50.264 --> 01:00:53.183
But whose?

814
01:00:56.687 --> 01:01:01.066
It's either the child
of her enemy...


815
01:01:01.108 --> 01:01:03.485
the man that killed
her husband...


816
01:01:05.154 --> 01:01:07.865
the man that raped her...

817
01:01:10.909 --> 01:01:14.455
in which case, she'll kill
herself and the child...


818
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:20.210
or it's the child
of her prince...


819
01:01:23.297 --> 01:01:25.632
the only thing
she has left of him...


820
01:01:27.342 --> 01:01:31.597
a part of him
still alive within her...


821
01:01:32.681 --> 01:01:34.850
kept safe inside her...

822
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.105
in which case...

823
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:47.071
But how would she know
until it was too late?


824
01:01:50.532 --> 01:01:52.242
How will she know...

825
01:01:52.284 --> 01:01:55.954
until the child is born
and she can see its eyes?


826
01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:02.002
Meet me right now.

827
01:02:02.044 --> 01:02:03.670
Somewhere public.

828
01:02:03.712 --> 01:02:06.173
Leave your apartment.
Meet me now.


829
01:02:39.415 --> 01:02:41.458
I thought that was you.

830
01:02:43.377 --> 01:02:46.088
I was standing over there
across the street...


831
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:50.342
and I said to myself,
"Now, is that Sherman Reese?"


832
01:02:50.384 --> 01:02:51.885
Nice to see you.

833
01:02:51.927 --> 01:02:53.137
Commander Armacost.

834
01:02:53.178 --> 01:02:55.889
Yeah. Are you in town
on official business?


835
01:02:55.931 --> 01:03:00.352
I'm not with NASA anymore.

836
01:03:00.394 --> 01:03:01.687
You know what?

837
01:03:01.729 --> 01:03:04.022
You know what?
I heard that.


838
01:03:04.064 --> 01:03:05.899
I heard that, and I thought...

839
01:03:05.941 --> 01:03:09.111
it was one of them nasty
agency rumors.


840
01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:10.487
Well, listen...

841
01:03:10.529 --> 01:03:13.866
if you need a recommendation,
don't hesitate...


842
01:03:13.907 --> 01:03:15.367
because maybe
I can help you out.


843
01:03:15.409 --> 01:03:17.870
Well, I appreciate that.

844
01:03:18.912 --> 01:03:22.124
It's real weird
running into you...


845
01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:26.045
'cause the thing of it is,
I was just thinking about you.


846
01:03:26.086 --> 01:03:29.923
I was thinking about them tests
you wanted to run on me...


847
01:03:29.965 --> 01:03:31.675
you know, after Alex died.

848
01:03:31.717 --> 01:03:33.427
lf you got a couple
of minutes right now...


849
01:03:33.469 --> 01:03:35.721
we can go down, have a cup
of coffee or something.


850
01:03:35.763 --> 01:03:37.347
Actually, I got to--

851
01:03:37.389 --> 01:03:39.266
Oh, no, come on, now, Sherman.

852
01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:41.060
You're a man of leisure.

853
01:03:41.101 --> 01:03:43.020
You ain't got nothing but time,
do you?


854
01:03:44.146 --> 01:03:46.440
Come on.

855
01:03:47.608 --> 01:03:49.443
Yeah, it's nice to see you.

856
01:04:04.792 --> 01:04:08.587
Almost forgot your satchel,
Mr. Reese.


857
01:04:08.629 --> 01:04:09.755
I got it.

858
01:04:41.495 --> 01:04:43.872
You were the only one
who knew, Nan.


859
01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:45.916
I asked you not to tell him.

860
01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:47.918
I didn't, OK?

861
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.421
What were you talking about
last night when I was sleeping?


862
01:04:50.462 --> 01:04:52.464
- We were just talking.
- About what?


863
01:04:52.506 --> 01:04:53.632
Just talking, Jillian.

864
01:04:53.674 --> 01:04:56.593
Look, don't do this.
It's not good for you.


865
01:04:56.635 --> 01:04:58.345
Where did you go last night?

866
01:04:58.387 --> 01:04:59.638
Will you listen to yourself?

867
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.806
Where did you go?!

868
01:05:00.848 --> 01:05:02.433
Look, Jillian, I love you, OK?

869
01:05:02.474 --> 01:05:05.102
And Spencer loves you.
We all do so much.


870
01:05:05.144 --> 01:05:08.147
Spencer was there.

871
01:05:08.188 --> 01:05:11.775
Nan, Spencer was there
with Reese...


872
01:05:11.817 --> 01:05:14.778
and you were the only one
who knew, Nan.


873
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.364
How did he know
unless you told him?!


874
01:05:17.406 --> 01:05:19.491
You promised me!

875
01:05:21.326 --> 01:05:22.619
Jillian, I love you...

876
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:25.164
but I'm not going to do this
with you.


877
01:05:30.544 --> 01:05:33.589
Do what with me?

878
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:34.798
Come back, Nan.

879
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.509
Nan, come back!

880
01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:40.262
Don't leave, Nan!

881
01:05:45.267 --> 01:05:47.269
Shit!

882
01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:11.085
Hello. Nesbit Arms.

883
01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:14.129
Mr. Reese in room three-oh-four.

884
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:26.558
There's no answer
in room three-oh-four.


885
01:06:30.104 --> 01:06:32.815
Down came the rain

886
01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:36.485
And washed the spider out

887
01:06:36.527 --> 01:06:38.904
Out came the sun

888
01:06:38.946 --> 01:06:42.491
And dried up all the rain

889
01:06:42.533 --> 01:06:45.786
And the itsy-bitsy spider

890
01:06:45.828 --> 01:06:48.580
Climbed up the spout again

891
01:09:02.923 --> 01:09:04.425
Oh, God.

892
01:09:25.821 --> 01:09:26.989
Are you OK?

893
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:42.129
It's like a joke, right?

894
01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:45.132
But if you are watching
this tape...


895
01:09:45.132 --> 01:09:47.760
I didn't get to that meeting.

896
01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:50.387
lf you are watching this tape,
Mrs. Armacost...


897
01:09:50.429 --> 01:09:51.722
I'm probably fucking dead!

898
01:09:51.764 --> 01:09:54.099
This is my backup.

899
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:57.102
That's what they
taught us at NASA.


900
01:09:57.144 --> 01:10:00.105
Always have a backup system.

901
01:10:00.147 --> 01:10:03.776
I'm not crazy.
I wish I was.


902
01:10:03.817 --> 01:10:08.113
I prayed I was.
I know I'm not.


903
01:10:08.155 --> 01:10:10.365
You might think you're crazy.

904
01:10:11.742 --> 01:10:12.993
How could you not?

905
01:10:17.539 --> 01:10:21.085
Always have a backup.

906
01:10:21.126 --> 01:10:24.004
You're going to hear
two voices on this tape.


907
01:10:24.004 --> 01:10:28.342
One is your husband's
and the other Captain Streck.


908
01:10:28.342 --> 01:10:31.678
I'm gonna rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees...


909
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.556
This line is your
husband's voice.


910
01:10:34.598 --> 01:10:36.517
This line is Captain Streck's.

911
01:10:36.517 --> 01:10:38.018
Spencer, what is that?

912
01:10:38.018 --> 01:10:39.603
What the fuck--

913
01:10:39.645 --> 01:10:42.106
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?!


914
01:10:42.147 --> 01:10:44.149
Two voices, but three lines.

915
01:10:44.191 --> 01:10:46.235
There's something else
on the tape.


916
01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:49.530
Something beyond our range
of hearing...


917
01:10:49.571 --> 01:10:51.532
but I translated it.

918
01:10:51.573 --> 01:10:53.659
I had to hear it...

919
01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:55.828
and this...

920
01:10:57.871 --> 01:11:00.165
is what it sounds like.

921
01:11:10.718 --> 01:11:13.053
NASA said that it's static...

922
01:11:13.053 --> 01:11:14.304
It's not static.

923
01:11:14.346 --> 01:11:16.056
...caused by the explosion
of the satellite...


924
01:11:16.098 --> 01:11:19.101
static buildup in their suits,
but it's not static.


925
01:11:19.143 --> 01:11:20.811
I tracked it.
It is not static.


926
01:11:20.853 --> 01:11:22.020
Not static.

927
01:11:22.062 --> 01:11:25.399
It's not from their suits,
the satellite, or shuttle.


928
01:11:27.276 --> 01:11:29.862
It's not from Earth, either.

929
01:11:32.448 --> 01:11:35.075
Two minutes-- that's all
there is. That's all it took.


930
01:11:35.117 --> 01:11:39.747
lf you wanted to come here
from very, very far away...


931
01:11:39.788 --> 01:11:43.083
maybe you wouldn’t
have to travel in a ship.


932
01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:45.210
Maybe you could travel
in a transmission...


933
01:11:45.252 --> 01:11:48.589
at the speed of light,
like a thought.


934
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.008
Just wait...

935
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:53.719
for two of us to be up there.

936
01:11:54.928 --> 01:11:56.597
Two of us...

937
01:11:56.638 --> 01:11:58.766
in orbit, near a target.

938
01:11:58.807 --> 01:12:00.726
Something to aim at,
like the satellite.


939
01:12:00.768 --> 01:12:03.979
Two of us beyond suspicion.

940
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:06.106
Heroes, all
-Americans.

941
01:12:06.148 --> 01:12:09.526
Wait for them...

942
01:12:09.568 --> 01:12:15.115
then erase them like a tape
and record your own message.


943
01:12:16.784 --> 01:12:19.661
He's not your husband anymore.

944
01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:21.121
He's not.

945
01:12:21.163 --> 01:12:22.414
What?

946
01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:25.542
The computer that runs
this airplane--


947
01:12:25.584 --> 01:12:27.252
it's not there.
It hasn't been designed yet...


948
01:12:27.294 --> 01:12:30.422
but it's supposed to go...
right here in the cockpit...


949
01:12:30.464 --> 01:12:33.634
right where the pilots
are supposed to be.


950
01:12:37.012 --> 01:12:41.100
Two computers that work
off each other...


951
01:12:41.141 --> 01:12:44.103
that feed off each other.

952
01:12:44.144 --> 01:12:46.271
Twins.

953
01:12:46.313 --> 01:12:47.981
Twin computers.

954
01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:51.944
Twins, Mrs. Armacost.

955
01:12:51.985 --> 01:12:54.988
What do you think
you have inside of you?


956
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:58.325
What do you think he put there?

957
01:12:58.325 --> 01:13:00.077
What are they going to be?

958
01:13:00.119 --> 01:13:02.246
They going to be pilots, honey.

959
01:13:02.287 --> 01:13:04.998
Just like their father.

960
01:13:15.342 --> 01:13:17.386
What's the matter?
Did I scare you?


961
01:13:17.428 --> 01:13:19.513
I didn't hear you come in.

962
01:13:21.265 --> 01:13:24.101
Listen, I came home, 'cause...

963
01:13:24.143 --> 01:13:27.896
I felt bad for you.
That fight with Nan, you know.


964
01:13:27.938 --> 01:13:30.858
Why don't tell me
what it was about?


965
01:13:30.858 --> 01:13:32.860
Just sister stuff.

966
01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.528
Have you heard from her?

967
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.867
Well...

968
01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:41.869
I'm sure she'll call you.

969
01:13:45.414 --> 01:13:46.874
You're trembling.

970
01:13:49.877 --> 01:13:51.128
I am?

971
01:13:54.089 --> 01:13:55.591
I'm a little cold.

972
01:13:59.678 --> 01:14:01.346
You know what I did?

973
01:14:01.388 --> 01:14:06.435
I brought something home
I believe's gonna cheer you up.


974
01:14:06.477 --> 01:14:07.811
What do you think?

975
01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:10.064
Pop it in.

976
01:14:17.196 --> 01:14:20.115
Were you watching something?

977
01:14:23.952 --> 01:14:28.040
It's a--
it's a pregnancy video.


978
01:14:32.086 --> 01:14:34.713
Well, maybe we should
watch it together.


979
01:14:40.552 --> 01:14:42.346
Let's watch the movie.

980
01:14:42.388 --> 01:14:44.681
You sure?

981
01:14:47.226 --> 01:14:50.062
All right.

982
01:14:51.897 --> 01:14:54.400
Why are you building that plane?

983
01:14:54.441 --> 01:14:56.443
What's that?

984
01:14:56.485 --> 01:14:58.070
Why do you have to
build that plane?


985
01:14:58.112 --> 01:15:00.823
It's a contract, Jill.

986
01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.074
And besides...

987
01:15:02.116 --> 01:15:05.661
I didn't add half as much
as Jackson said I did.


988
01:15:05.703 --> 01:15:08.831
They got some real sharp
engineers over there.


989
01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:10.666
Come here.
Mmm, back here.


990
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:13.877
Come on.

991
01:15:25.848 --> 01:15:27.808
I know what you're thinking.

992
01:15:30.394 --> 01:15:31.979
Don't you worry.

993
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.899
Everything's gonna be just fine.

994
01:16:25.074 --> 01:16:27.743
Yeah, these pesky
goddamn satellites.


995
01:16:27.785 --> 01:16:29.536
I'm gonna rotate the panel
forty-eight degrees.


996
01:16:29.578 --> 01:16:31.038
You got me AIex?

997
01:16:31.038 --> 01:16:34.166
Spencer, what is that?
Did you feel that?


998
01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:35.793
Spencer, what is that?

999
01:16:35.834 --> 01:16:36.960
What the fuck--

1000
01:16:37.002 --> 01:16:39.755
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?!


1001
01:16:57.064 --> 01:16:58.649
Must have dozed off.

1002
01:17:00.734 --> 01:17:02.569
Were you dreaming?

1003
01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:07.074
No. Just sleeping.

1004
01:17:09.159 --> 01:17:10.452
You weren't dreaming?

1005
01:17:14.707 --> 01:17:16.250
I wasn't dreamin'.

1006
01:17:20.796 --> 01:17:22.089
Were you?

1007
01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.138
My caterer gets them
from the French Caribbean.


1008
01:17:29.179 --> 01:17:32.599
The French are so much more
advanced in this way.


1009
01:17:36.228 --> 01:17:37.688
Now, listen, with these...

1010
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:40.733
all sales are final.

1011
01:17:40.774 --> 01:17:43.652
Are you sure this is the way
you want to go?


1012
01:17:55.789 --> 01:17:57.416
Now, when you get home...

1013
01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:59.793
you take both pills
and then go to bed.


1014
01:17:59.835 --> 01:18:02.296
It's gonna be quite a bit
of vile crampin'...


1015
01:18:02.337 --> 01:18:03.839
but as soon as you
start spottin'...


1016
01:18:03.881 --> 01:18:05.424
it goes real fast.

1017
01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.801
And Spencer won't know?

1018
01:18:07.801 --> 01:18:09.386
lf he's anything
like the rest...


1019
01:18:09.428 --> 01:18:10.971
he'll think
you had a miscarriage...


1020
01:18:11.013 --> 01:18:13.307
and he'll go out
and buy you a bracelet.


1021
01:18:20.773 --> 01:18:24.068
Now, don't beat yourself up
about this, sweetheart.


1022
01:18:24.109 --> 01:18:29.448
I mean, it's not as if
any of this means anything.


1023
01:18:37.956 --> 01:18:40.626
There's a little bit of pain...

1024
01:18:40.667 --> 01:18:43.504
and then it's over.

1025
01:18:46.382 --> 01:18:47.591
Oh, God.

1026
01:18:47.633 --> 01:18:49.676
I can't.

1027
01:18:49.718 --> 01:18:51.804
Oh, God.

1028
01:18:51.845 --> 01:18:54.681
I can't do it.

1029
01:18:54.723 --> 01:18:57.810
It's gonna be really bad.

1030
01:19:02.147 --> 01:19:04.274
I'm so sorry.

1031
01:19:04.316 --> 01:19:07.945
You'll understand.

1032
01:19:07.986 --> 01:19:09.488
I have to.

1033
01:19:12.032 --> 01:19:13.158
Wait.

1034
01:19:14.368 --> 01:19:15.494
Just...

1035
01:19:17.246 --> 01:19:19.039
a little pain.

1036
01:19:19.081 --> 01:19:20.999
Just...

1037
01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:23.544
And then it's over.

1038
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:33.887
They're just babies.

1039
01:19:33.929 --> 01:19:35.222
I can't do it.

1040
01:19:35.264 --> 01:19:36.724
Oh, God.

1041
01:19:36.765 --> 01:19:38.267
I can't do it.

1042
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.353
Oh, help me!

1043
01:19:43.564 --> 01:19:46.316
No. Don't do that.

1044
01:19:54.324 --> 01:19:55.826
Oh, God, stop it.

1045
01:19:55.868 --> 01:19:58.037
He's gonna...

1046
01:20:02.499 --> 01:20:04.126
They're just-- they're...

1047
01:20:11.091 --> 01:20:13.177
Oh, God, no.

1048
01:20:14.678 --> 01:20:16.972
What were you gonna do to 'em?

1049
01:20:22.227 --> 01:20:25.064
No, you heard them.
Oh, God.


1050
01:20:25.105 --> 01:20:26.482
What were you gonna do?!

1051
01:20:29.068 --> 01:20:30.611
Nothing.

1052
01:20:51.965 --> 01:20:54.843
Jill...please.

1053
01:20:56.637 --> 01:21:00.557
Let's just calm down
and talk about this, OK?


1054
01:21:07.314 --> 01:21:08.982
Come on, now, honey.

1055
01:21:17.825 --> 01:21:19.493
Where you gonna go, Jill?

1056
01:22:27.061 --> 01:22:28.562
Don't talk.

1057
01:22:28.604 --> 01:22:31.482
Don't say a word, honey.

1058
01:22:31.523 --> 01:22:34.068
You're fine.
You're fine now.


1059
01:22:37.821 --> 01:22:39.490
They're still inside you, Jill.

1060
01:22:39.531 --> 01:22:42.534
They're right where
they need to be...


1061
01:22:42.576 --> 01:22:46.914
and we're not ever gonna mention
what you tried to do...


1062
01:22:46.955 --> 01:22:49.416
what you tried to do
with them pills, OK?


1063
01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:51.710
Doesn't exist.

1064
01:22:51.752 --> 01:22:53.712
Never happened, Jillian.

1065
01:22:55.631 --> 01:23:00.094
I don't want to hear
a peep out of you.


1066
01:23:00.135 --> 01:23:03.472
You hear me?

1067
01:23:03.514 --> 01:23:05.724
I love you so much.

1068
01:23:05.766 --> 01:23:07.768
I don't know what I'd do...

1069
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:11.647
if anything ever happened
to you or the babies.


1070
01:23:11.688 --> 01:23:16.527
Now, you just keep quiet,
and you rest.


1071
01:23:16.568 --> 01:23:18.237
I'm here with you.

1072
01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:24.284
I'm always gonna be here,
Jill, always.


1073
01:23:28.664 --> 01:23:29.873
You sleep.

1074
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:32.918
Good girl.

1075
01:23:57.151 --> 01:23:59.945
I don't want to fight
with you, Jilly.


1076
01:23:59.987 --> 01:24:02.906
There's something wrong, Nan.

1077
01:24:02.948 --> 01:24:04.616
There's not.

1078
01:24:04.658 --> 01:24:06.577
Doctor says
you can go home any day.


1079
01:24:06.618 --> 01:24:09.705
No. Something's wrong...

1080
01:24:09.747 --> 01:24:11.331
with Spencer...

1081
01:24:11.373 --> 01:24:12.791
and the twins.

1082
01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:14.460
Hey, it's just this place.

1083
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.630
No.
He did something to me, Nan...


1084
01:24:18.672 --> 01:24:21.341
and I didn't tell you.

1085
01:24:22.509 --> 01:24:24.803
Jillian, it's just
being in the hospital...


1086
01:24:24.845 --> 01:24:26.805
that makes you feel this way.

1087
01:24:26.847 --> 01:24:29.308
I know that you hate it here...

1088
01:24:29.349 --> 01:24:31.393
but we're gonna
take you home soon...


1089
01:24:31.435 --> 01:24:33.812
and we're all gonna
take care of you.


1090
01:24:33.854 --> 01:24:35.022
You?

1091
01:24:35.064 --> 01:24:36.648
Yeah, of course me.

1092
01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:38.358
Me, Spencer, all of us.

1093
01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:41.403
Oh, God.

1094
01:24:43.363 --> 01:24:44.990
I'm so scared.

1095
01:24:45.032 --> 01:24:48.410
Something horrible
is happening...


1096
01:24:48.452 --> 01:24:49.787
to me...

1097
01:24:49.828 --> 01:24:51.205
and the babies.

1098
01:24:51.205 --> 01:24:53.874
I don't know what's happening.

1099
01:24:53.916 --> 01:24:57.211
Tell me, Jillian, what is it?

1100
01:25:04.176 --> 01:25:05.594
He...

1101
01:25:07.471 --> 01:25:10.099
He's hiding inside me.

1102
01:25:13.435 --> 01:25:15.938
Hiding...

1103
01:25:16.939 --> 01:25:18.565
inside me.

1104
01:25:33.455 --> 01:25:35.916
I think she's awake,
Mr. Armacost.


1105
01:26:03.485 --> 01:26:05.028
Tell me something, Jill.

1106
01:26:07.281 --> 01:26:08.782
lf the doctors...

1107
01:26:08.824 --> 01:26:11.160
had any idea
what you were thinking...


1108
01:26:12.369 --> 01:26:15.080
you know, them awful...

1109
01:26:15.122 --> 01:26:16.540
dark thoughts...

1110
01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:20.586
what do you think they'd do?

1111
01:26:23.255 --> 01:26:24.590
They'd lock me up.

1112
01:26:31.764 --> 01:26:34.433
Lock you up?

1113
01:26:34.475 --> 01:26:36.518
They'd chain you
to the wall, Jillian.


1114
01:26:39.938 --> 01:26:43.317
Yeah, put you back
in that hospital.


1115
01:26:45.152 --> 01:26:46.779
You want that to happen?

1116
01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:55.621
I know you don't want that.

1117
01:26:55.662 --> 01:26:59.500
Well...we ain't gonna
let 'em, are we?


1118
01:27:05.631 --> 01:27:07.299
'Cause we're gonna be strong.

1119
01:27:08.675 --> 01:27:10.052
We're gonna be strong.

1120
01:27:11.595 --> 01:27:12.930
Together.

1121
01:27:12.971 --> 01:27:15.974
We're gonna be strong
for our family.


1122
01:27:22.022 --> 01:27:23.524
We're connected now.

1123
01:27:26.193 --> 01:27:29.530
You feel me inside there
where it's safe, don't you?


1124
01:27:35.411 --> 01:27:36.995
See?

1125
01:27:40.499 --> 01:27:41.792
I live here.

1126
01:27:44.044 --> 01:27:45.713
We're one.

1127
01:28:14.867 --> 01:28:17.202
Why do you have
Sherman Reese's bag?


1128
01:28:19.913 --> 01:28:23.459
What did you do to my sister?

1129
01:28:25.377 --> 01:28:27.504
Who are you?

1130
01:28:29.923 --> 01:28:32.885
What the hell are you doing?

1131
01:28:32.926 --> 01:28:34.762
Let go of me!

1132
01:28:45.064 --> 01:28:46.940
Jillian! Help!

1133
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.897
Washington Square Park.

1134
01:31:04.495 --> 01:31:05.662
What?

1135
01:31:08.082 --> 01:31:10.376
- Go. Go!
- But it is red, missis.


1136
01:31:10.417 --> 01:31:11.543
I don't care!
Just go!


1137
01:31:11.585 --> 01:31:12.753
But, missis, I cannot.

1138
01:31:12.795 --> 01:31:15.047
Will you go?!
You don't understand!


1139
01:31:15.089 --> 01:31:16.465
- Please.
- I cannot.


1140
01:32:16.817 --> 01:32:19.903
Captain Alex Streck died
last night at eight fifty-five.


1141
01:32:22.114 --> 01:32:23.991
Cause of death
has been determined...


1142
01:32:23.991 --> 01:32:25.659
to have been a massive stroke...

1143
01:32:27.327 --> 01:32:30.622
what the surgeons are calling
a severe insult to the brain.


1144
01:32:30.664 --> 01:32:33.542
He's not your husband anymore.

1145
01:33:41.693 --> 01:33:43.570
Welcome back, Mrs. A.

1146
01:33:54.498 --> 01:33:55.833
Good morning, Mr. A.

1147
01:36:23.897 --> 01:36:25.816
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Jill.

1148
01:36:49.757 --> 01:36:51.759
Stay away from me.

1149
01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.553
Why are you doing this to me?

1150
01:36:54.595 --> 01:36:58.098
I said stay...

1151
01:36:58.140 --> 01:36:59.975
away from me.

1152
01:37:10.277 --> 01:37:12.112
Who are you?

1153
01:37:12.112 --> 01:37:14.615
Who am I?

1154
01:37:15.616 --> 01:37:19.953
I'm the only person in the world
who ever gave a fuck about you.


1155
01:37:22.122 --> 01:37:25.834
I'm the one that gave you
a reason to breathe.


1156
01:37:27.002 --> 01:37:30.672
I'm every single fuckin' moment
ever mattered in your life.


1157
01:37:32.633 --> 01:37:33.926
No, you’re not.

1158
01:37:35.969 --> 01:37:37.554
I don't even know you.

1159
01:37:37.596 --> 01:37:40.766
No? Well...

1160
01:37:40.808 --> 01:37:42.476
I'll tell you what.

1161
01:37:42.518 --> 01:37:45.646
There was a time I remember
when I was about to go up...


1162
01:37:45.687 --> 01:37:48.440
and you begged me not to.

1163
01:37:48.482 --> 01:37:51.610
You remember
how scared you were?


1164
01:37:51.652 --> 01:37:53.278
And I told you then...

1165
01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.573
that I was gonna bring you back
a little piece of heaven.


1166
01:37:57.825 --> 01:37:59.827
Then you cried.

1167
01:37:59.868 --> 01:38:01.453
You remember that?

1168
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.581
Well, fuckin' a!

1169
01:38:04.623 --> 01:38:06.125
I did!

1170
01:38:06.166 --> 01:38:08.210
What do you think's inside you?

1171
01:38:13.006 --> 01:38:15.467
I gave you heaven.

1172
01:38:15.509 --> 01:38:18.011
No, you didn't.

1173
01:38:20.347 --> 01:38:22.391
You're not Spencer.

1174
01:38:26.061 --> 01:38:28.397
It don't got to be like this,
honey.


1175
01:38:28.439 --> 01:38:29.773
Please, come on, now.

1176
01:38:29.815 --> 01:38:31.608
Step out of that water.

1177
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:33.944
Please, baby,
get out of that water.


1178
01:38:35.696 --> 01:38:37.030
Come on.

1179
01:38:37.072 --> 01:38:38.741
Oh, my God.

1180
01:38:40.743 --> 01:38:41.952
Please.

1181
01:38:44.163 --> 01:38:46.331
Oh, my God.

1182
01:38:49.418 --> 01:38:51.712
You killed my sister.

1183
01:38:54.506 --> 01:38:57.676
You killed my husband.

1184
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:06.852
I did.

1185
01:39:10.397 --> 01:39:12.608
And then I fucked his wife.

1186
01:39:16.278 --> 01:39:17.863
I live there.

1187
01:39:45.974 --> 01:39:48.560
I live there...

1188
01:39:48.602 --> 01:39:49.937
forever.

1189
01:39:49.978 --> 01:39:51.855
No, you don't.

1190
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.957
I live there.

1191
01:40:09.998 --> 01:40:11.959
No, you don't!

1192
01:41:14.688 --> 01:41:17.024
Ready for your first day
of school?


1193
01:41:17.024 --> 01:41:18.233
Ready.

1194
01:41:18.275 --> 01:41:20.152
Wait.

1195
01:41:20.194 --> 01:41:24.156
There's an apple in there,
and I want you guys to eat it.


1196
01:41:24.198 --> 01:41:25.324
No trading.
Promise?


1197
01:41:25.365 --> 01:41:26.700
Promise.

1198
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.869
OK. Give me a kiss.

1199
01:41:31.205 --> 01:41:32.539
Go, go, go, go, go.

1200
01:41:32.539 --> 01:41:33.749
Be good.

1201
01:41:37.711 --> 01:41:40.172
What do you think they'll be
when they grow up?


1202
01:41:40.214 --> 01:41:41.799
Grow up?

1203
01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.843
Give them some time, Susan.
It's their first day of school.


1204
01:41:44.927 --> 01:41:46.678
I think...

1205
01:41:49.431 --> 01:41:51.558
they're gonna be pilots.

1206
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.603
Just like their father.

1207
01:41:54.603 --> 01:41:56.146
Stepfather.

1208
01:42:01.068 --> 01:42:03.904
You're their father now.
