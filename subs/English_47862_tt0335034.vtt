1
00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:04.656
Told you to be

2
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.859
unheard and unseen.

3
00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:08.093
Invisible.

4
00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:09.428
Noise you're making,

5
00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:10.529
I'm damn sure the animal's in

6
00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:11.830
Mississippi by now.

7
00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:13.465
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:15.534
Now we in the water

9
00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:18.694
so he don't hear us coming.

10
00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:22.174
That's a smart animal.

11
00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:27.079
He see, he smell,

12
00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:29.715
hear you coming.

13
00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.518
So you got to be smarter.

14
00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:33.986
Yes, Daddy.

15
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.922
You understand me?

16
00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.023
Yes, Daddy.

17
00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.992
You got to be smarter.

18
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:41.951
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:53.839
There he is.

20
00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.542
There he is.

21
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.643
Damn.

22
00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.845
Come on, boy!

23
00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.982
Stay with me. Come on!

24
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:05.651
Come on, come on, boy.

25
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.019
I'm with you!

26
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.812
Come on!

27
00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:23.869
Darn!

28
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:24.903
He got away.

29
00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:30.976
What you laughing at?

30
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.578
You think this is

31
00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:36.582
fooling around?

32
00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:38.550
You got to respect this.

33
00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:42.921
Some nights your brain and gun

34
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:45.824
is what put dinner on the table.

35
00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:49.952
It's about survival.

36
00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:57.102
It's all right.

37
00:02:57.126 --> 00:03:00.005
We almost got him.

38
00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:04.877
Quiet.

39
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:09.047
What's wrong, Dad?

40
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.249
Quiet, Marcus!

41
00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.017
Don't make a sound.

42
00:03:28.257 --> 00:03:29.135
Come on, boy.

43
00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.904
Dollar waiting on a dime.

44
00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:33.639
Keep your nose clean.

45
00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:34.607
Catch up now,

46
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.065
don't be laggin behnid.

47
00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:38.176
I'll see you

48
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.069
in church on Sunday.

49
00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:03.035
Stay out here.

50
00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.896
Don't move.

51
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.903
Don't move.

52
00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:54.286
I hoped you'd live

53
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.855
and never see that.

54
00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.660
It's done now.

55
00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:04.129
Don't ever forget it, Marcus.

56
00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:06.322
Don't ever forget it.

57
00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:25.050
Get your elbow off the table.

58
00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:25.917
Come on now. Finish up.

59
00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:26.786
You gotta do better

60
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.819
than that, Daddy.

61
00:05:27.843 --> 00:05:29.121
More bite, come on.

62
00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:30.822
Nobody know I'm here.

63
00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:32.724
Come on now, Daddy.

64
00:05:32.748 --> 00:05:33.393
I'm doing it right now.

65
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:34.926
Marcus, I can do it myself.

66
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.361
Be still.

67
00:05:36.385 --> 00:05:37.929
One bite.

68
00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:39.798
Brooks, quit fooling around

69
00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:40.465
with your food.

70
00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:41.333
Go on and get your books and

71
00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:42.234
get the hell on outta here.

72
00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.101
You gonna try

73
00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:43.970
to work tonight?

74
00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:45.971
No.

75
00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:48.030
Come on, give me a kiss.

76
00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:50.475
See you when I get home,

77
00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:51.343
Papa.

78
00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:52.211
You think you'd know

79
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:54.312
I was here.

80
00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:57.082
Lucille?

81
00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:58.784
What's that on your blouse?

82
00:05:58.808 --> 00:05:59.985
It's from the Civil Rights

83
00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.086
League office.

84
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.987
I thought the sheriff

85
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:02.955
closed that office down.

86
00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.056
Kids at school say

87
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.157
they're gonna open it up again.

88
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.091
I don't give a damn.

89
00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.060
Take it off.

90
00:06:07.084 --> 00:06:08.460
But, Daddy, it's just a...

91
00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:09.328
Take it off before

92
00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:11.120
I rip it off!

93
00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.102
Now go.

94
00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.028
Go on.

95
00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:46.298
Gonna be late again.

96
00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:57.476
Hey, Mr. Weber?

97
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.543
How you feeling?

98
00:06:58.567 --> 00:06:59.412
Feeling good since

99
00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.512
I passed that stone.

100
00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:02.447
Oh, that's pain.

101
00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:05.150
Oh, boy, that is pain.

102
00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:06.218
You never knew

103
00:07:06.242 --> 00:07:07.452
that kind of hurt.

104
00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:09.154
No, sir, Mr. Conley,

105
00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:10.056
I've never known

106
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.423
that kind of hurt.

107
00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:12.891
Five orders are on the board.

108
00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:14.059
I want 'em packed and on

109
00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.193
the road before lunch.

110
00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:16.294
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:16.318 --> 00:07:17.529
Forklift knocked a stack

112
00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:19.231
of bales off their pallets.

113
00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:20.398
Clean it up.

114
00:07:20.422 --> 00:07:23.859
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:30.299
Y'all have a good day.

116
00:07:34.103 --> 00:07:35.247
I'm sure glad

117
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:36.181
you're here, man.

118
00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:37.116
This place been running like

119
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.283
a crapper all morning.

120
00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:39.384
We need to get rolling.

121
00:07:39.408 --> 00:07:40.552
All right.

122
00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:44.823
Let's start this up.

123
00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:47.959
52 bales, bay 2.

124
00:07:47.983 --> 00:07:49.027
Help me bring this back on.

125
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:49.895
Come on.

126
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:50.830
Morning, Marcus.

127
00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:51.963
How you doing, man?

128
00:07:51.987 --> 00:07:53.064
Feeling pretty good.

129
00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:53.932
How's your daddy?

130
00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:54.600
I'm feeding him,

131
00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:55.867
so he's eating more.

132
00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:56.836
That's good.

133
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.837
Hey, hey, hey, T. J., man.

134
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:59.004
My sister-in-law's coming up

135
00:07:59.028 --> 00:07:59.871
from New Orleans again

136
00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:00.539
Why don't you come over

137
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.406
for dinner?

138
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.274
No.

139
00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:03.141
Hey, what?

140
00:08:03.165 --> 00:08:04.009
You afraid of marriage, huh?

141
00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:04.876
Just sitting around

142
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.544
the house getting fat?

143
00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:06.411
Oh, why not?

144
00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:07.346
'Cause I done

145
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.480
seen your in-laws.

146
00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:09.381
Hey, hey, hey!

147
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.283
Try to do something good for

148
00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:11.583
you, look what you do, man.

149
00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:13.885
Pull this back on.

150
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:15.053
Our shift don't start

151
00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:16.022
for two minutes.

152
00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:17.889
Pull it back. Come on.

153
00:08:17.913 --> 00:08:20.358
Man ain't gonna pay us more,

154
00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:21.293
for working two minutes,

155
00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:22.317
you know.

156
00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:32.270
All right.

157
00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:34.005
Put a bee in your bonnet.

158
00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:37.142
Come on, man.

159
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:39.301
We've got five orders to do.

160
00:08:53.482 --> 00:08:54.659
Here we are.

161
00:08:54.683 --> 00:08:58.496
So this is it, huh?

162
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.533
This is it.

163
00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:03.235
Very nice.

164
00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.502
Is that a bullet hole?

165
00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:06.104
Shot gun.

166
00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:08.039
Okay. Where do we start?

167
00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:09.608
Well, tomorrow we get

168
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.276
Louisiana driver's licenses.

169
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.344
That way if we get stopped,

170
00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:13.612
we don't get hassled none.

171
00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:14.546
We are definitely gonna have

172
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.413
to move these beds away

173
00:09:15.437 --> 00:09:16.281
from the windows.

174
00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:17.216
You know why?

175
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.650
Less chance of getting shot at.

176
00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:19.618
Here, we'll tack these up

177
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:20.485
against the windows

178
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:21.353
so we can actually turn

179
00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:22.254
the lights on at night.

180
00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:23.155
Then all we gotta do is

181
00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:24.189
find a safe exit outta here

182
00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:25.290
in case the place gets bombed

183
00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:31.429
or catches fire somehow.

184
00:09:31.453 --> 00:09:32.453
You okay?

185
00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:45.310
I like the white one best.

186
00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:46.378
We don't have it in

187
00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:47.612
a five and three-quarters,

188
00:09:47.636 --> 00:09:50.015
but we can order it.

189
00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:54.552
Excuse me.

190
00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:57.155
Can I help you?

191
00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:59.557
I'm just looking, thank you,

192
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:00.493
ma'am.

193
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:02.360
You put that hat on

194
00:10:02.384 --> 00:10:07.389
your head, you buy it.

195
00:10:14.063 --> 00:10:17.032
Thank you, ma'am.

196
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.751
Hey, how you doing?

197
00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:29.587
We're here to end segregation.

198
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.455
Hi, how you doing?

199
00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:31.323
My name's Charlie from

200
00:10:31.347 --> 00:10:32.190
the civil rights office.

201
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.058
I'm trying to end segregation

202
00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:33.725
in public places.

203
00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:34.592
We're with the National Civil

204
00:10:34.616 --> 00:10:35.561
Rights League.

205
00:10:35.585 --> 00:10:36.594
We're gonna be at

206
00:10:36.618 --> 00:10:37.495
the church on Sunday.

207
00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:38.363
We'd love to have the

208
00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:39.231
opportunity to talk to you.

209
00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:40.232
I think you may be interested

210
00:10:40.256 --> 00:10:41.266
in what we have to say.

211
00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:46.771
Hold on!

212
00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:47.639
You may be interested

213
00:10:47.663 --> 00:10:48.506
in what I have to say.

214
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.374
This plant does not give

215
00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:50.241
you the opportunity

216
00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:51.109
to advance past the

217
00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:51.777
low menial jobs.

218
00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:53.244
We're planning on protesting

219
00:10:53.268 --> 00:10:54.146
and setting up...

220
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.246
Morning, Mr. Conley.

221
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.114
Some boycotts for the

222
00:10:56.138 --> 00:10:57.016
white businesses

223
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.216
that do not hire black workers.

224
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.117
Hi.

225
00:10:59.141 --> 00:11:00.085
Please come to the church on

226
00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:00.753
Sunday where we can have

227
00:11:00.777 --> 00:11:01.754
the opportunity to talk to you.

228
00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:03.355
We're gonna set up boycotts...

229
00:11:16.558 --> 00:11:19.804
♪ Do not pass me by

230
00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:22.273
♪ Do not pass me by

231
00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:24.142

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:25.643

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.178

237
00:11:39.715 --> 00:11:41.459
Hallelujah!

238
00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:44.129
Hallelujah!

239
00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:45.397
You made us so happy

240
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:46.598
with that beautiful music.

241
00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.600
Let the church say amen!

242
00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.101
Amen.

243
00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:54.706
Now this morning, we have

244
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.243
two young men from up north

245
00:11:58.267 --> 00:11:59.844
and they're going to reopen

246
00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:01.679
the National Civil

247
00:12:01.703 --> 00:12:04.115
Rights League office and

248
00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:04.784
they asked for a minute

249
00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.684
of our time.

250
00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:08.753
Mr. Deane, please come forward.

251
00:12:15.217 --> 00:12:16.528
Ladies and gentlemen of

252
00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:18.863
the church, Reverend Gregory,

253
00:12:18.887 --> 00:12:22.200
deacons, elders, trustees,

254
00:12:22.224 --> 00:12:23.401
thank you for granting us

255
00:12:23.425 --> 00:12:24.402
this opportunity

256
00:12:24.426 --> 00:12:25.703
to speak to you today.

257
00:12:25.727 --> 00:12:27.539
My name is Michael Deane

258
00:12:27.563 --> 00:12:29.274
and this is my colleague,

259
00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:30.708
Charles Hillibrand.

260
00:12:30.732 --> 00:12:32.177
I've been an attorney

261
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:33.145
for eight years.

262
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.579
I teach at Columbia University

263
00:12:34.603 --> 00:12:35.647
in New York.

264
00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:38.316
I've spent a great deal of time

265
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.851
working in the south fighting

266
00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:42.320
for a cause that I believe in

267
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:43.354
from the bottom of my heart.

268
00:12:43.378 --> 00:12:45.356
I'm gonna go have a smoke.

269
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.325
And that's for a moment

270
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:47.725
of nonviolent integration,

271
00:12:47.749 --> 00:12:49.260
integration into

272
00:12:49.284 --> 00:12:50.728
the public schools,

273
00:12:50.752 --> 00:12:53.198
integration into the workplace.

274
00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:54.632
Now I have seen change occur

275
00:12:54.656 --> 00:12:56.301
all over the south and I know,

276
00:12:56.325 --> 00:12:57.535
if we work hard together,

277
00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:58.636
we can make those changes

278
00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.505
happen right here

279
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:00.705
in Bogalusa, Louisiana.

280
00:13:00.729 --> 00:13:02.740
I'm here to help you.

281
00:13:02.764 --> 00:13:04.175
Excuse me?

282
00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:05.610
With your permission,

283
00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:06.579
Reverend Gregory?

284
00:13:06.603 --> 00:13:07.712
You have my permission.

285
00:13:07.736 --> 00:13:09.614
Mr. Deane, are you aware

286
00:13:09.638 --> 00:13:11.583
that the last man that

287
00:13:11.607 --> 00:13:12.451
the National Civil

288
00:13:12.475 --> 00:13:14.385
Rights League sent down here,

289
00:13:14.409 --> 00:13:15.887
Brother Moon, left town

290
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.455
in the middle of the night?

291
00:13:17.479 --> 00:13:20.191
They firebombed his house.

292
00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:21.392
He didn't really understand

293
00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:23.728
what was goin' on down here.

294
00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:25.597
I'm aware that Brother Moon

295
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:27.398
was disrespectfully removed

296
00:13:27.422 --> 00:13:28.833
from this community.

297
00:13:28.857 --> 00:13:31.269
But, sir, I do understand

298
00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:32.770
what is going on.

299
00:13:32.794 --> 00:13:33.872
I went to Mississippi when

300
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.206
Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner

301
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.941
were missing and I was there

302
00:13:36.965 --> 00:13:38.443
when their bodies were

303
00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:39.944
dragged out of the water.

304
00:13:39.968 --> 00:13:40.813
The Klan in

305
00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:42.280
this part of the country

306
00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:44.382
is extremely violent.

307
00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:46.851
We protest,

308
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.786
they bust our heads open!

309
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.523
And the newspapers don't even

310
00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:52.857
take pictures of it,

311
00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:53.925
so how you gonna

312
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:56.261
get us national exposure?

313
00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:58.897
Well, we do what

314
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.532
Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.

315
00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:01.633
Does.

316
00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:03.234
We get our younger people

317
00:14:03.258 --> 00:14:04.769
involved in the marches.

318
00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:06.204
We get our younger people

319
00:14:06.228 --> 00:14:07.372
involved in the protests.

320
00:14:07.396 --> 00:14:08.239
What?

321
00:14:08.263 --> 00:14:08.908
Now believe me, if anyone

322
00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:09.974
should try and attack them,

323
00:14:09.998 --> 00:14:11.976
the press will be here!

324
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.478
Permission to speak,

325
00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:14.380
Reverend Gregory?

326
00:14:14.404 --> 00:14:15.413
Speak, son.

327
00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:16.481
Now no disrespect

328
00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:17.415
to the elders,

329
00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:18.284
but as a young person

330
00:14:18.308 --> 00:14:19.484
of the church, I have been

331
00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:20.518
following the changes

332
00:14:20.542 --> 00:14:21.653
these men been talkin' about.

333
00:14:21.677 --> 00:14:23.454
Now I think, if we want Bogalusa

334
00:14:23.478 --> 00:14:27.392
to change, now's the time!

335
00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:28.793
And why not here?

336
00:14:28.817 --> 00:14:30.395
You know, Reverend King was

337
00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:31.763
only 26 years old during

338
00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:33.831
the Montgomery bus boycotts.

339
00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:35.266
And people our age been

340
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.235
changing things

341
00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:38.436
all over the south.

342
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.306
There will be violence.

343
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.740
Now can I guarantee that

344
00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:44.008
no one is going to get hurt?

345
00:14:44.032 --> 00:14:45.009
No, I can't.

346
00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:46.544
But I can guarantee that,

347
00:14:46.568 --> 00:14:48.346
if there are blows to be taken,

348
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.481
I will take the first blows.

349
00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:51.549
Thank you.

350
00:14:54.876 --> 00:14:57.655
All right, all right,

351
00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:59.023
settle down.

352
00:14:59.047 --> 00:14:59.959
This man is talking about

353
00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.760
our children, our children.

354
00:15:02.784 --> 00:15:03.795
And that not only gives us

355
00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:05.530
something to think about,

356
00:15:05.554 --> 00:15:06.498
but something also

357
00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:08.299
to pray about!

358
00:15:08.323 --> 00:15:09.034
Marcus, you didn't even

359
00:15:09.058 --> 00:15:10.401
hear what the man had to say.

360
00:15:10.425 --> 00:15:11.636
That boy's got

361
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.571
some pretty good ideas.

362
00:15:12.595 --> 00:15:13.671
He gonna bring some folks

363
00:15:13.695 --> 00:15:14.806
in from up north.

364
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:15.807
And they could make a change

365
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.275
'cause I'm getting damn tired

366
00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:18.376
of the way it is.

367
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.410
I'm telling you, Marcus,

368
00:15:19.434 --> 00:15:20.511
God's with us.

369
00:15:20.535 --> 00:15:21.613
How much did God help those

370
00:15:21.637 --> 00:15:23.314
little girls in Birmingham?

371
00:15:23.338 --> 00:15:26.818
Hi. I'm Michael Deane.

372
00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:28.620
Timothy McDaniels.

373
00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:29.821
Call me T. J.

374
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.789
Archie, Archie Scott.

375
00:15:31.813 --> 00:15:33.291
Hi.

376
00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:35.760
What can we do?

377
00:15:35.784 --> 00:15:36.629
I wanna talk to you about

378
00:15:36.653 --> 00:15:37.829
setting up some boycotts.

379
00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:38.731
You're on your own

380
00:15:38.755 --> 00:15:39.732
with this one, T. J.

381
00:15:39.756 --> 00:15:40.798
And together we could change

382
00:15:40.822 --> 00:15:42.033
the conditions of that plant.

383
00:15:42.057 --> 00:15:44.535
What you have in mind?

384
00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:47.672
Lucille? Let's go.

385
00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:48.940
I'm gone.

386
00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:50.408
Oh, come on, Marcus.

387
00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:51.343
You ready?

388
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:55.747
Come on.

389
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:57.448
I wanna drive a truck

390
00:15:57.472 --> 00:15:58.516
at the plant.

391
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.652
I worked in transport in Korea.

392
00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:02.654
Or be a loading supervisor.

393
00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:03.721
What do I have
to do to get it?

394
00:16:03.745 --> 00:16:04.589
Tell me how it

395
00:16:04.613 --> 00:16:05.457
works down there.

396
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:06.491
Well, right now,

397
00:16:06.515 --> 00:16:08.893
all the supervisors are white.

398
00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.795
No black can apply for it.

399
00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:11.929
Most the blacks

400
00:16:11.953 --> 00:16:13.765
have menial jobs, low pay.

401
00:16:13.789 --> 00:16:16.425
It's real bad.

402
00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:20.571
What's that, Mr. Weber?

403
00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:21.639
Sign-up sheet for

404
00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:22.774
loading supervisor,

405
00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:24.442
extra 50 cents an hour.

406
00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:25.943
I'm in.

407
00:16:25.967 --> 00:16:27.779
Come on, Kenny.

408
00:16:27.803 --> 00:16:29.447
Extra 50 cents an hour

409
00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:30.915
should keep you on your butt.

410
00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:32.083
50 cents an hour?

411
00:16:32.107 --> 00:16:35.753
Hell, I can live with that.

412
00:16:35.777 --> 00:16:38.523
It's not for you boys.

413
00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:39.524
Come on, T. J.,

414
00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:42.827
let's go home.

415
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:45.063
Come on, T. J.

416
00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:47.498
Yeah, you right.

417
00:16:47.522 --> 00:16:48.499
I ain't gonna take

418
00:16:48.523 --> 00:16:49.667
no more of this.

419
00:16:49.691 --> 00:16:50.668
Where you going?

420
00:16:50.692 --> 00:16:56.007
T. J.?

421
00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.876
What you doing, T. J.?

422
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.812
Signing my name.

423
00:17:00.836 --> 00:17:01.679
T. J., you need to

424
00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:02.648
come down here.

425
00:17:02.672 --> 00:17:03.748
Come on down.

426
00:17:03.772 --> 00:17:04.717
Mr. Weber?

427
00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:06.117
T. J., you can't

428
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:07.118
put your name up there.

429
00:17:07.142 --> 00:17:08.152
Now you know that.

430
00:17:08.176 --> 00:17:09.487
Why not?

431
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:10.922
Coloreds don't do

432
00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:12.090
the supervisor positions.

433
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:15.960
You understand that?

434
00:17:15.984 --> 00:17:17.395
There's a first time

435
00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.422
for everything, Mr. Weber.

436
00:17:25.193 --> 00:17:26.037
Better have a talk

437
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:26.972
with your boy, Marcus.

438
00:17:26.996 --> 00:17:29.040
Yes, sir.

439
00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:30.008
Yes, sir, Mr. Weber.

440
00:17:30.032 --> 00:17:31.042
I'm gonna talk to him.

441
00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:33.702
I'll talk to him.

442
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.014
T. J., what in the name

443
00:17:37.038 --> 00:17:38.916
of holy God got into you?

444
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.585
You gone crazy?

445
00:17:40.609 --> 00:17:41.953
You can get us all killed.

446
00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:45.046
I'm tired, Marcus.

447
00:17:48.884 --> 00:17:52.063
Fear the night, niggers.

448
00:17:52.087 --> 00:17:54.923
Fear the night.

449
00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:13.117
Hey, Dad. How you feel?

450
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:14.519
I'm okay for a man

451
00:18:14.543 --> 00:18:16.154
with a stroke.

452
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.655
Where is everybody?

453
00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.757
Well, hey to you too.

454
00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:20.858
Sorry.

455
00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:22.627
I'm just hungry or something.

456
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:26.063
Lucille! Brooks!

457
00:18:26.087 --> 00:18:27.832
Supper's on, let's go!

458
00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:30.001
She not home.

459
00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:33.237
Where is she?

460
00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:35.706
Where is she, Rose?

461
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.874
She's at the Civil Rights

462
00:18:36.898 --> 00:18:37.742
League office with

463
00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:38.609
the two white boys.

464
00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:39.477
Lookie here, you're gonna

465
00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:40.144
have to give her

466
00:18:40.168 --> 00:18:41.013
a little room on this!

467
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.213
Oh, no, I don't.

468
00:18:42.237 --> 00:18:43.781
Now Reverend King has used

469
00:18:43.805 --> 00:18:45.783
people our age in the past.

470
00:18:45.807 --> 00:18:48.019
We can march and we can protest,

471
00:18:48.043 --> 00:18:49.487
but nobody's gonna change

472
00:18:49.511 --> 00:18:51.122
our city except ourselves.

473
00:18:51.146 --> 00:18:52.190
Now we need to get every

474
00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.992
Negro person voting in Bogalusa.

475
00:18:55.016 --> 00:18:56.694
But with all due respect,

476
00:18:56.718 --> 00:18:57.995
the Negro Voters League

477
00:18:58.019 --> 00:18:59.230
run by Reverend Gregory

478
00:18:59.254 --> 00:19:00.798
is completely ineffective.

479
00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:04.769
Now keep in mind

480
00:19:04.793 --> 00:19:06.237
what we're talking about.

481
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:07.805
Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner

482
00:19:07.829 --> 00:19:09.273
were just murdered for doing

483
00:19:09.297 --> 00:19:11.175
exactly what we are discussing.

484
00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:12.110
So I want everyone

485
00:19:12.134 --> 00:19:13.277
to talk to their parents.

486
00:19:13.301 --> 00:19:14.179
I want everyone to think about

487
00:19:14.203 --> 00:19:15.813
the potential dangers involved.

488
00:19:15.837 --> 00:19:17.915
Don't go into this lightly,

489
00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:21.552
okay?

490
00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:22.987
Lucille! Come on.

491
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:25.957
Excuse me. I gotta go.

492
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:26.858
Daddy?

493
00:19:26.882 --> 00:19:27.725
Shut up.

494
00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:28.594
We're gonna deal with this

495
00:19:28.618 --> 00:19:29.827
when we get home.

496
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:31.062
If you find you near her,

497
00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:32.230
talking to her,

498
00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:33.165
getting her involved

499
00:19:33.189 --> 00:19:34.932
in any way, I'm gonna slap

500
00:19:34.956 --> 00:19:36.100
the taste out your mouth.

501
00:19:36.124 --> 00:19:37.124
Let's go.

502
00:19:39.294 --> 00:19:40.304
Well, well,

503
00:19:40.328 --> 00:19:41.606
what do we have here?

504
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.306
Y'all gonna have to cease

505
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.174
and desist.

506
00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:44.042
We're closing

507
00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:45.109
this office down once again.

508
00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:46.811
You are not permitted

509
00:19:46.835 --> 00:19:48.079
to practice law in

510
00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:49.247
the state of Louisiana.

511
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:50.148
Am I correct?

512
00:19:50.172 --> 00:19:51.182
Yes, you are correct.

513
00:19:51.206 --> 00:19:52.083
Yeah, well, do you wanna

514
00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:52.950
close the doors

515
00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:53.819
or you wanna go to jail?

516
00:19:53.843 --> 00:19:55.052
Sir, while we are not members

517
00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:56.621
of the Louisiana Bar,

518
00:19:56.645 --> 00:19:57.755
state law does allow us

519
00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:58.623
to disseminate our

520
00:19:58.647 --> 00:19:59.557
legal opinions

521
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:00.225
so long as we don't attempt

522
00:20:00.249 --> 00:20:01.325
to actually practice law

523
00:20:01.349 --> 00:20:02.693
or have ourselves passed off

524
00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:04.195
as state-sanctioned attorneys.

525
00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:05.229
All right.

526
00:20:05.253 --> 00:20:06.297
We'll let the court decide.

527
00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:07.231
Cuff 'em.

528
00:20:07.255 --> 00:20:08.100
This building is

529
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:09.133
the private property

530
00:20:09.157 --> 00:20:10.902
of a nonprofit organization!

531
00:20:10.926 --> 00:20:12.837
By interfering with our

532
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:14.038
organization, you're in direct

533
00:20:14.062 --> 00:20:15.172
violation of several city

534
00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:16.307
and state codes!

535
00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:17.175
All right!

536
00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:18.709
I want this place cleared out or

537
00:20:18.733 --> 00:20:20.912
else you'll follow 'em to jail!

538
00:20:20.936 --> 00:20:21.979
Where y'all going?

539
00:20:22.003 --> 00:20:22.980
Don't wanna see you

540
00:20:23.004 --> 00:20:24.148
here anymore, all right?

541
00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:25.249
Marcus, what the hell

542
00:20:25.273 --> 00:20:26.183
are you doing here?

543
00:20:26.207 --> 00:20:27.051
I'm just getting my daughter.

544
00:20:27.075 --> 00:20:27.919
I want you to talk

545
00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:28.786
to these people.

546
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.654
I don't wanna

547
00:20:29.678 --> 00:20:30.321
see 'em here again.

548
00:20:30.345 --> 00:20:31.189
I don't wanna have

549
00:20:31.213 --> 00:20:32.256
to arrest 'em.

550
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.082
Yes, sir.

551
00:20:41.022 --> 00:20:41.866
Reverend Gregory know

552
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:42.890
what you're doing?

553
00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:47.672
You be careful.

554
00:20:47.696 --> 00:20:49.941
You be real careful.

555
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.922
Time to go home, cat.

556
00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:11.228
Go on, go on.

557
00:21:11.252 --> 00:21:13.855
Hey, T. J.!

558
00:21:22.964 --> 00:21:27.044
You ain't goin' nowhere!

559
00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:28.679
You're gonna take your name

560
00:21:28.703 --> 00:21:29.680
off that list tomorrow.

561
00:21:29.704 --> 00:21:31.048
You hear me, boy?

562
00:21:31.072 --> 00:21:32.249
I got a right to have my name

563
00:21:32.273 --> 00:21:33.284
on that list!

564
00:21:33.308 --> 00:21:35.419
Oh, no, you don't.

565
00:21:35.443 --> 00:21:37.121
Marcus!

566
00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:38.056
You're gonna take your name

567
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.256
off that list tomorrow.

568
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.324
I got a right to have my name

569
00:21:40.348 --> 00:21:41.692
on that list!

570
00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:43.294
No, you don't.

571
00:21:43.318 --> 00:21:45.296
Marcus!

572
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.665
Are you gonna take it off?

573
00:21:47.689 --> 00:21:49.066
I got a right

574
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.201
to put my name on that list!

575
00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:51.435
You're taking your name off

576
00:21:51.459 --> 00:21:54.138
that list tomorrow, hear me?

577
00:21:54.162 --> 00:21:57.108
Marcus!

578
00:22:02.704 --> 00:22:05.740
Praise the Lord.

579
00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:25.771
The only reason you boys

580
00:22:25.795 --> 00:22:26.871
ain't hurting is 'cause you

581
00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:29.073
got the same skin color as God.

582
00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:30.908
But this is a one-time pass.

583
00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:32.843
Remember what happened to those

584
00:22:32.867 --> 00:22:35.904
northern boys in Mississippi.

585
00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:43.244
Y'all know which way to go.

586
00:22:53.788 --> 00:22:55.933
Let's go.

587
00:22:55.957 --> 00:23:01.138
You've gotta be kidding me!

588
00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:03.174
No. I'm not kidding.

589
00:23:03.198 --> 00:23:04.275
They're not fooling around,

590
00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:05.309
Michael!

591
00:23:05.333 --> 00:23:06.877
They will kill us!

592
00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:08.279
Yeah, I know.

593
00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:09.146
Why are you willing

594
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.082
to die for this?

595
00:23:10.106 --> 00:23:12.316
Do you hear me?

596
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.853
Why, Charlie?

597
00:23:15.877 --> 00:23:18.989
Because our skin is not

598
00:23:19.013 --> 00:23:21.916
the same color as God's.

599
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.162
It's okay.

600
00:23:25.186 --> 00:23:30.501
I respect you.

601
00:23:30.525 --> 00:23:35.206
You take care of yourself.

602
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.775
Michael?

603
00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:38.976
I'm not like you!

604
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.911
I wanna get married and live

605
00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:43.805
to see my children, Goddamn it!

606
00:23:55.316 --> 00:23:58.086
Goddamn it!

607
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.064
You okay?

608
00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.933
It was a damn fool

609
00:25:08.957 --> 00:25:10.601
thing to do, Marcus.

610
00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.436
I should have listened to you.

611
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.938
I'm sorry.

612
00:25:13.962 --> 00:25:16.507
Nothing to be sorry about.

613
00:25:16.531 --> 00:25:18.375
I heard it.

614
00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:19.543
I should have helped.

615
00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:22.146
I know your heart, Marcus.

616
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.548
Besides, you got a family.

617
00:25:24.572 --> 00:25:27.976
I should have known better.

618
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:52.476
Marcus! Marcus!

619
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.410
It's your daddy!

620
00:25:53.434 --> 00:25:54.278
Is he all right?

621
00:25:54.302 --> 00:25:55.145
I don't know,

622
00:25:55.169 --> 00:25:56.013
there's something wrong.

623
00:25:56.037 --> 00:25:56.681
What's goin' on?

624
00:25:56.705 --> 00:25:57.982
Hey, Daddy?

625
00:25:58.006 --> 00:25:59.383
Daddy?

626
00:25:59.407 --> 00:26:01.118
I'm gonna get you

627
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:02.419
to the hospital.

628
00:26:02.443 --> 00:26:04.421
You all right?

629
00:26:04.445 --> 00:26:06.924
Scared.

630
00:26:06.948 --> 00:26:09.493
Don't be scared, Daddy.

631
00:26:09.517 --> 00:26:12.420
God's with you.

632
00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:21.405
You don't...

633
00:26:21.429 --> 00:26:26.668
be scared.

634
00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:42.250
Daddy?

635
00:26:45.286 --> 00:26:48.122
Daddy?

636
00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:56.597
All right, Daddy.

637
00:27:47.181 --> 00:27:48.025
Treat us fair,

638
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.760
treat us right!

639
00:27:48.784 --> 00:27:51.228
Negroes' money accounts

640
00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:54.131
for 37% of Bogalusa's

641
00:27:54.155 --> 00:27:55.499
downtown business.

642
00:27:55.523 --> 00:27:58.435
But none of those businesses

643
00:27:58.459 --> 00:28:00.204
will hire Negro workers!

644
00:28:00.228 --> 00:28:01.072
Now there are gonna be people

645
00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:02.573
who will try and provoke us,

646
00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:04.475
people who will try and

647
00:28:04.499 --> 00:28:06.276
intimidate us, make us

648
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.045
give in, make us go home!

649
00:28:08.069 --> 00:28:09.446
We not goin' home!

650
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.715
Get the hell off this street!

651
00:28:11.739 --> 00:28:13.684
This is a decent town!

652
00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:14.551
Treat us right!

653
00:28:14.575 --> 00:28:15.453
Treat us fair.

654
00:28:15.477 --> 00:28:16.453
Treat us right!

655
00:28:16.477 --> 00:28:17.389
Treat us fair!

656
00:28:17.413 --> 00:28:18.390
Treat us right!

657
00:28:18.414 --> 00:28:19.656
Treat us fair!

658
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.524
Look out the window,

659
00:28:20.548 --> 00:28:21.393
Mr. Mayor.

660
00:28:21.417 --> 00:28:23.193
People coming in to do

661
00:28:23.217 --> 00:28:24.162
their shopping,

662
00:28:24.186 --> 00:28:25.229
do their banking.

663
00:28:25.253 --> 00:28:26.330
They see what's

664
00:28:26.354 --> 00:28:27.464
goin' on down there.

665
00:28:27.488 --> 00:28:29.533
They're not even parking!

666
00:28:29.557 --> 00:28:30.834
Now I'm not fooling around

667
00:28:30.858 --> 00:28:31.702
with this.

668
00:28:31.726 --> 00:28:32.570
We are losing a lot

669
00:28:32.594 --> 00:28:33.737
of business, Sam!

670
00:28:33.761 --> 00:28:36.473
We need you to end it now!

671
00:28:36.497 --> 00:28:37.508
Clarence,

672
00:28:37.532 --> 00:28:38.476
it's not that simple.

673
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.077
Just arrest 'em.

674
00:28:40.101 --> 00:28:41.111
It's not gonna work.

675
00:28:41.135 --> 00:28:42.112
They're minors.

676
00:28:42.136 --> 00:28:42.814
These charges aren't gonna

677
00:28:42.838 --> 00:28:44.248
mean a damn thing to them.

678
00:28:44.272 --> 00:28:45.616
Well, just say the word.

679
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.719
We got clubs, we got tear gas.

680
00:28:48.743 --> 00:28:50.320
They won't come back.

681
00:28:50.344 --> 00:28:51.688
Find me a legal reason

682
00:28:51.712 --> 00:28:52.723
I can do it.

683
00:28:52.747 --> 00:28:54.191
Throw a dart.

684
00:28:54.215 --> 00:28:55.359
They're threatening city

685
00:28:55.383 --> 00:28:56.294
property.

686
00:28:56.318 --> 00:28:57.861
Good enough.

687
00:28:57.885 --> 00:29:00.431
Do it the old-fashioned way.

688
00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:02.666
Walter, I don't want this

689
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.201
in Bogalusa.

690
00:29:11.432 --> 00:29:13.710
You all are in violation of

691
00:29:13.734 --> 00:29:16.647
several city ordinances and are

692
00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:20.184
ordered to disperse immediately!

693
00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:21.185
We are within our

694
00:29:21.209 --> 00:29:23.754
rights to protest peacefully!

695
00:29:23.778 --> 00:29:24.788
Don't move!

696
00:29:24.812 --> 00:29:25.856
Legally, they cannot

697
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.257
do anything to us.

698
00:29:27.281 --> 00:29:28.459
Move out!

699
00:29:28.483 --> 00:29:29.427
Are you hearing

700
00:29:29.451 --> 00:29:30.527
what I'm saying?

701
00:29:30.551 --> 00:29:32.329
I am telling you

702
00:29:32.353 --> 00:29:34.331
for the last time!

703
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:35.632
Form your lines!

704
00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:37.434
Move or we will move you

705
00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:40.170
forcibly and arrest you!

706
00:29:40.194 --> 00:29:42.206
If you do, you will be

707
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.907
violating our constitutional

708
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:46.777
rights to assemble and protest!

709
00:29:46.801 --> 00:29:50.204
This is your last warning!

710
00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:56.677
Gas 'em!

711
00:29:59.814 --> 00:30:01.258
Hold steady.

712
00:30:01.282 --> 00:30:01.926
Marcus, Marcus,

713
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.229
ain't that Lucille?

714
00:30:05.253 --> 00:30:06.763
Where you goin', Marcus?

715
00:30:16.831 --> 00:30:19.333
Lucille!

716
00:30:34.949 --> 00:30:35.959
I'll kill you,

717
00:30:35.983 --> 00:30:38.328
you hit my daughter!

718
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:54.645
Marcus, come on!

719
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:56.346
Get Lucille.

720
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.581
Get Lucille, Marcus!

721
00:30:57.605 --> 00:31:01.251
Come on!

722
00:31:07.248 --> 00:31:08.792
Let's go! Come on, Marcus.

723
00:31:08.816 --> 00:31:10.494
Come on, baby.

724
00:31:10.518 --> 00:31:12.296
You're gonna pay, nigger.

725
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.264
Go, let's go!

726
00:31:18.693 --> 00:31:20.895
Ah!

727
00:31:25.333 --> 00:31:26.710
God damn commie traitor.

728
00:31:26.734 --> 00:31:28.812
Traitor!

729
00:31:28.836 --> 00:31:30.338
Let's go!

730
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:36.744
Charlie, get 'em outta here!

731
00:31:55.963 --> 00:31:57.341
Get in the car!

732
00:31:57.365 --> 00:31:58.966
Start!

733
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.705
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

734
00:32:15.449 --> 00:32:16.293
Don't want to hear

735
00:32:16.317 --> 00:32:16.960
nothing else about this!

736
00:32:16.984 --> 00:32:17.861
Nothing!

737
00:32:17.885 --> 00:32:18.730
When they said no colored,

738
00:32:18.754 --> 00:32:20.397
they don't mean no grown folks!

739
00:32:20.421 --> 00:32:21.365
They mean me, Daddy!

740
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:22.066
I done told you no!

741
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.600
You know what no means! No!

742
00:32:23.624 --> 00:32:24.468
Lucille, you were

743
00:32:24.492 --> 00:32:25.336
nearly killed today!

744
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.603
It's over with! It's over!

745
00:32:26.627 --> 00:32:27.871
Black folks have been

746
00:32:27.895 --> 00:32:29.439
killed by the Klan since ever

747
00:32:29.463 --> 00:32:30.774
and you won't do nothing!

748
00:32:30.798 --> 00:32:31.642
Lucille, you don't

749
00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:32.510
shut your mouth,

750
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:33.510
I swear to God I'm gonna knock

751
00:32:33.534 --> 00:32:34.379
some sense into your head.

752
00:32:34.403 --> 00:32:35.946
No! Then hit me, Daddy,

753
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.047
your daughter!

754
00:32:37.071 --> 00:32:38.348
Get mad at the white man,

755
00:32:38.372 --> 00:32:39.016
not me!

756
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.884
Lucille!

757
00:32:39.908 --> 00:32:40.917
No! No!

758
00:32:40.941 --> 00:32:41.785
There is a lot

759
00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:42.809
you don't understand!

760
00:32:45.579 --> 00:32:49.526
He won't listen!

761
00:32:51.752 --> 00:32:54.898
No. You're right, baby.

762
00:32:54.922 --> 00:32:56.066
They went to hit you.

763
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.734
I didn't think twice

764
00:32:57.758 --> 00:33:01.071
about stopping 'em.

765
00:33:01.095 --> 00:33:03.540
You're right, baby.

766
00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:06.367
What's that make me?

767
00:33:07.968 --> 00:33:08.879
Nobody move!

768
00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:09.746
Get back!

769
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:10.770
Get your hands where...

770
00:33:14.008 --> 00:33:15.485
Just don't hurt my family!

771
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:16.753
Jimmy, is that him?

772
00:33:16.777 --> 00:33:17.622
Yes, sir.

773
00:33:17.646 --> 00:33:20.824
Take him away!

774
00:33:20.848 --> 00:33:23.694
Where you taking my husband?

775
00:33:23.718 --> 00:33:24.662
He assaulted

776
00:33:24.686 --> 00:33:25.696
a police officer.

777
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.563
Now we're just

778
00:33:26.587 --> 00:33:27.465
gonna question him.

779
00:33:27.489 --> 00:33:28.665
Daddy!

780
00:33:28.689 --> 00:33:30.000
Brooks, you stay there!

781
00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:30.934
Really disappointed me,

782
00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:31.802
Marcus.

783
00:33:31.826 --> 00:33:32.669
I was just

784
00:33:32.693 --> 00:33:33.604
protecting my daughter.

785
00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:35.372
Nigger, that's a privilege

786
00:33:35.396 --> 00:33:36.807
you don't have.

787
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:37.974
Take him away.

788
00:33:37.998 --> 00:33:40.510
No!

789
00:33:40.534 --> 00:33:41.745
Stay back outta the way!

790
00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:43.613
Come on, boy.

791
00:33:43.637 --> 00:33:44.581
What's the name of

792
00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:45.449
the white boy lawyer

793
00:33:45.473 --> 00:33:46.116
you been working with?

794
00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:46.983
Michael Deane.

795
00:33:47.007 --> 00:33:47.851
All right.

796
00:33:47.875 --> 00:33:48.719
You go pack your bag and

797
00:33:48.743 --> 00:33:49.586
you and Brooks go down

798
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.555
to Auntie Bella's house now!

799
00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:51.722
Go!

800
00:33:51.746 --> 00:33:52.856
I'll call you later!

801
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.715
Brooks, let's go!

802
00:34:05.526 --> 00:34:07.838
Rose Clay and my partner,

803
00:34:07.862 --> 00:34:08.839
Charlie, just got back

804
00:34:08.863 --> 00:34:09.940
from the jail.

805
00:34:09.964 --> 00:34:11.174
When they got there, they found

806
00:34:11.198 --> 00:34:12.676
out that Marcus had not been

807
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.777
charged with any crime

808
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:15.645
and he had been released

809
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:16.847
just minutes earlier.

810
00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:18.548
So that's another Negro

811
00:34:18.572 --> 00:34:19.883
on your head!

812
00:34:19.907 --> 00:34:21.885
My son can't stand because

813
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:22.953
of the pain in his back

814
00:34:22.977 --> 00:34:24.588
from where he was clubbed.

815
00:34:24.612 --> 00:34:25.789
How dare you bring

816
00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:26.857
children out there!

817
00:34:29.116 --> 00:34:30.527
Leave is be!

818
00:34:30.551 --> 00:34:33.830
I'm sorry.

819
00:34:33.854 --> 00:34:35.165
Believe me, that was the last

820
00:34:35.189 --> 00:34:37.167
thing that we wanted to happen,

821
00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:39.603
but we are not

822
00:34:39.627 --> 00:34:45.208
going to stop now.

823
00:34:45.232 --> 00:34:47.210
Enough!

824
00:34:47.234 --> 00:34:48.545
Stop!

825
00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:50.714
As head of the Voters League,

826
00:34:50.738 --> 00:34:52.015
I'm gonna meet with the mayor

827
00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:53.450
and I'm gonna ask him

828
00:34:53.474 --> 00:34:54.985
to guarantee the safety

829
00:34:55.009 --> 00:34:56.820
of the Negro people.

830
00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:58.221
And in exchange for that,

831
00:34:58.245 --> 00:35:00.056
the Voters League

832
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.658
will make every effort

833
00:35:01.682 --> 00:35:03.894
to stop these protests

834
00:35:03.918 --> 00:35:06.220
at City Hall.

835
00:35:16.697 --> 00:35:19.733
Marcus?

836
00:35:24.905 --> 00:35:26.974
Marcus?

837
00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:33.881
Marcus?

838
00:35:49.163 --> 00:35:53.777
Oh, Marcus, my God.

839
00:35:53.801 --> 00:35:57.714
Look what they did to you.

840
00:35:57.738 --> 00:35:59.216
We gotta take you to

841
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.917
the hospital, baby.

842
00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:02.118
Everybody's at

843
00:36:02.142 --> 00:36:03.553
the church worrying about you.

844
00:36:03.577 --> 00:36:06.156
Look at me, Rose.

845
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.260
You see what they did to me?

846
00:36:10.284 --> 00:36:15.832
See what I look like?

847
00:36:15.856 --> 00:36:20.704
I've spent all my life,

848
00:36:20.728 --> 00:36:26.209
all my life,

849
00:36:26.233 --> 00:36:29.880
yes, sir, no, sir.

850
00:36:29.904 --> 00:36:33.183
I never looked 'em in the eye

851
00:36:33.207 --> 00:36:34.618
and I been always

852
00:36:34.642 --> 00:36:36.319
smiling at 'em.

853
00:36:36.343 --> 00:36:38.321
You see what they did?

854
00:36:38.345 --> 00:36:41.625
They beat me like a dog, Rose.

855
00:36:41.649 --> 00:36:46.062
They don't want me to even

856
00:36:46.086 --> 00:36:50.100
have the thought,

857
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:55.338
the thought that I'm a man.

858
00:36:55.362 --> 00:36:59.109
They said they gonna

859
00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:00.810
do the same.

860
00:37:00.834 --> 00:37:03.280
They gonna do the same thing

861
00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:05.315
to Brooks and they gonna

862
00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:07.017
do the same thing

863
00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:08.919
to Brooks' kids and

864
00:37:08.943 --> 00:37:09.787
they gonna do

865
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:13.356
the same thing to they kids.

866
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.794
And this has gotta stop.

867
00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:21.731
This has gotta stop, Rose.

868
00:37:21.755 --> 00:37:25.735
I gotta do somethin'.

869
00:37:25.759 --> 00:37:32.175
I gotta do somethin'.

870
00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:34.210
That's gonna change.

871
00:37:34.234 --> 00:37:35.779
Marcus, please.

872
00:37:35.803 --> 00:37:40.750
Take me to church, okay?

873
00:37:40.774 --> 00:37:43.753
Let's go to church.

874
00:37:43.777 --> 00:37:44.955
I would like

875
00:37:44.979 --> 00:37:45.989
the Voters League

876
00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:47.190
to call a vote on whether

877
00:37:47.214 --> 00:37:49.359
to endorse these protests

878
00:37:49.383 --> 00:37:51.127
and that'll be the first vote.

879
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:53.630
And then I want to put on

880
00:37:53.654 --> 00:37:54.998
the table the issue

881
00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:57.267
of asking Mr. Deane

882
00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:58.401
and his partner

883
00:37:58.425 --> 00:38:00.103
to leave town,

884
00:38:00.127 --> 00:38:03.106
bring peace to our community!

885
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.676
Over my dead body!

886
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.345
Marcus?

887
00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:09.946
Marcus?

888
00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.247
Hey, let me take you

889
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:12.115
to the hospital.

890
00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:12.983
I'm okay.

891
00:38:13.007 --> 00:38:13.851
Matter of fact,

892
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:14.852
I'm doing pretty good.

893
00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:19.155
Just let me be.

894
00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:21.224
Go on with your meeting, Rev.

895
00:38:21.248 --> 00:38:25.195
I'm so sorry, Marcus.

896
00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:27.330
It's okay.

897
00:38:27.354 --> 00:38:29.666
It's the last time.

898
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:30.734
Let's just go on

899
00:38:30.758 --> 00:38:31.868
with the meeting.

900
00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:33.770
Well, I was gonna call

901
00:38:33.794 --> 00:38:35.171
for a vote on asking

902
00:38:35.195 --> 00:38:36.439
Mr. Deane...

903
00:38:36.463 --> 00:38:38.408
No! Never again!

904
00:38:38.432 --> 00:38:39.709
Marcus, we're going

905
00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:40.410
to have a vote!

906
00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:41.277
And if they want to,

907
00:38:41.301 --> 00:38:42.246
Reverend, these young people

908
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:43.346
gonna march tomorrow and

909
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.849
the day after and the day after!

910
00:38:45.873 --> 00:38:47.851
I understand your pain, but

911
00:38:47.875 --> 00:38:49.819
that is not for you to decide!

912
00:38:49.843 --> 00:38:50.688
And that

913
00:38:50.712 --> 00:38:52.022
includes my daughter!

914
00:38:52.046 --> 00:38:53.823
And not Neely or the Klan

915
00:38:53.847 --> 00:38:54.991
or any of these white

916
00:38:55.015 --> 00:38:55.926
sons of bitches are

917
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.460
ever gonna hurt them again!

918
00:38:57.484 --> 00:38:58.795
I understand you're hurt,

919
00:38:58.819 --> 00:39:00.830
but this is God's house!

920
00:39:00.854 --> 00:39:02.966
Do not use that language

921
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:04.200
in here!

922
00:39:04.224 --> 00:39:09.339
Now we're gonna have a vote.

923
00:39:09.363 --> 00:39:11.875
I call a vote for a new

924
00:39:11.899 --> 00:39:13.710
leader of the Voters League!

925
00:39:13.734 --> 00:39:16.379
Pastor Gregory, we know each

926
00:39:16.403 --> 00:39:18.048
other for a lot of years now

927
00:39:18.072 --> 00:39:20.183
and I love you like a brother,

928
00:39:20.207 --> 00:39:24.721
but it's a new time.

929
00:39:24.745 --> 00:39:27.023
In the rest of the south,

930
00:39:27.047 --> 00:39:28.458
you know what they calling this?

931
00:39:28.482 --> 00:39:30.226
"Freedom Summer".

932
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.961
Why shouldn't it

933
00:39:31.985 --> 00:39:33.163
be "Freedom Summer"

934
00:39:33.187 --> 00:39:35.799
in Bogalusa, Louisiana?

935
00:39:35.823 --> 00:39:39.436
I nominate Marcus Clay!

936
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.504
Marcus has always dealt

937
00:39:41.528 --> 00:39:42.772
with the white management

938
00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:44.474
of the plant for us.

939
00:39:44.498 --> 00:39:45.875
He'd be good.

940
00:39:45.899 --> 00:39:47.444
I second that nomination!

941
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:48.745
All those in favor

942
00:39:48.769 --> 00:39:49.512
of Marcus Clay

943
00:39:49.536 --> 00:39:50.480
becoming the new leader

944
00:39:50.504 --> 00:39:51.348
of the Voters League,

945
00:39:51.372 --> 00:39:53.083
raise your hands.

946
00:39:53.107 --> 00:39:54.984
Raise your hands!

947
00:39:55.008 --> 00:39:57.821
All those opposed?

948
00:39:57.845 --> 00:39:59.355
I can't go along with that.

949
00:39:59.379 --> 00:40:01.524
Well, then it's done.

950
00:40:01.548 --> 00:40:04.427
Marcus?

951
00:40:04.451 --> 00:40:05.395
Right.

952
00:40:05.419 --> 00:40:06.262
Come on, Marcus.

953
00:40:06.286 --> 00:40:07.131
Say somethin', Marcus.

954
00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:09.766
Come on, Marcus.

955
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.167
Reverend Gregory, you served

956
00:40:11.191 --> 00:40:12.435
this church for many years.

957
00:40:12.459 --> 00:40:13.436
I have great respect

958
00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.072
for Reverend Gregory.

959
00:40:16.096 --> 00:40:18.241
He has always been there for me.

960
00:40:18.265 --> 00:40:20.877
I don't know what to tell y'all.

961
00:40:20.901 --> 00:40:22.145
I'm gonna talk

962
00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:23.546
to these white boys here.

963
00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.383
They must have some idea.

964
00:40:27.407 --> 00:40:29.219
Truth is, I only know

965
00:40:29.243 --> 00:40:33.523
one thing for sure.

966
00:40:33.547 --> 00:40:36.893
What happened to our

967
00:40:36.917 --> 00:40:40.330
children today will never

968
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:44.934
ever happen again

969
00:40:44.958 --> 00:40:46.202
or they will have

970
00:40:46.226 --> 00:40:49.029
to come through me.

971
00:40:52.132 --> 00:40:55.369
Reverend?

972
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:07.381
Don't ever forget it.

973
00:41:21.195 --> 00:41:22.438
So what's on your mind,

974
00:41:22.462 --> 00:41:23.573
Marcus?

975
00:41:23.597 --> 00:41:24.508
You killed white men,

976
00:41:24.532 --> 00:41:26.209
didn't you, T. J.?

977
00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:27.277
Yeah.

978
00:41:27.301 --> 00:41:29.546
How many? You told me.

979
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.581
Two, three you know of

980
00:41:31.605 --> 00:41:33.049
in a war in Germany?

981
00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:34.184
Yeah.

982
00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:37.253
Why are we afraid now?

983
00:41:37.277 --> 00:41:38.521
You're all crazy.

984
00:41:38.545 --> 00:41:39.589
I was in the war.

985
00:41:39.613 --> 00:41:42.058
I fought hard for my country.

986
00:41:42.082 --> 00:41:43.059
I was a tanker man.

987
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:44.360
Archie?

988
00:41:44.384 --> 00:41:45.862
You and T. J.

989
00:41:45.886 --> 00:41:46.896
Served together in Korea.

990
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.931
I have fought

991
00:41:47.955 --> 00:41:49.499
in the First War.

992
00:41:49.523 --> 00:41:51.167
You killed white men?

993
00:41:51.191 --> 00:41:52.168
I did.

994
00:41:52.192 --> 00:41:54.304
You remember Double V?

995
00:41:54.328 --> 00:41:57.507
What it meant to Negro soldiers?

996
00:41:57.531 --> 00:41:59.943
Victory abroad, victory at home,

997
00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:01.878
victory against oppression,

998
00:42:01.902 --> 00:42:03.346
racism.

999
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.447
We with you, Marcus.

1000
00:42:04.471 --> 00:42:05.316
What happened

1001
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.482
to that victory?

1002
00:42:06.506 --> 00:42:07.884
What you suggesting, sir?

1003
00:42:07.908 --> 00:42:08.918
I'm suggesting

1004
00:42:08.942 --> 00:42:11.221
we defend ourselves.

1005
00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:12.388
Most of the Negroes

1006
00:42:12.412 --> 00:42:13.556
live in Mapleton,

1007
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.225
so we secure it.

1008
00:42:15.249 --> 00:42:17.927
Archie? T. J.?

1009
00:42:17.951 --> 00:42:20.029
You wanna secure...

1010
00:42:20.053 --> 00:42:21.030
Yes, sir.

1011
00:42:21.054 --> 00:42:23.433
First, we arm ourselves.

1012
00:42:23.457 --> 00:42:25.201
Lock the Klan outta

1013
00:42:25.225 --> 00:42:26.369
of our neighborhood.

1014
00:42:26.393 --> 00:42:28.605
Second, we take night shifts

1015
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:29.473
at the plant so we can

1016
00:42:29.497 --> 00:42:30.607
watch over our children when

1017
00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:32.242
they march in the protest.

1018
00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:33.376
Well, when do we sleep?

1019
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.912
You sleep when you dead.

1020
00:42:35.936 --> 00:42:37.480
Third, we give armed escorts

1021
00:42:37.504 --> 00:42:39.115
to these white boys so they can

1022
00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:40.350
stay and organize so we can get

1023
00:42:40.374 --> 00:42:41.918
that godforsaken paper plant

1024
00:42:41.942 --> 00:42:43.152
desegregated and get the jobs

1025
00:42:43.176 --> 00:42:44.420
we have coming to us!

1026
00:42:44.444 --> 00:42:45.288
There was a group that

1027
00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:46.156
he was talking about

1028
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.157
in Alabama and, I think,

1029
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:48.224
in Mississippi.

1030
00:42:48.248 --> 00:42:49.359
They made like little armies

1031
00:42:49.383 --> 00:42:50.326
protecting folks from

1032
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:51.294
the Night Riders.

1033
00:42:51.318 --> 00:42:52.229
They did it. So can we.

1034
00:42:52.253 --> 00:42:53.263
Marcus, ain't this taking

1035
00:42:53.287 --> 00:42:54.397
things a little too far?

1036
00:42:54.421 --> 00:42:55.465
It's called for

1037
00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:56.633
and you know it, Archie!

1038
00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:58.501
This is an army of one,

1039
00:42:58.525 --> 00:43:01.537
then it's an army of one.

1040
00:43:01.561 --> 00:43:03.439
I gave my word.

1041
00:43:03.463 --> 00:43:06.075
Gentlemen, I've been waiting

1042
00:43:06.099 --> 00:43:11.672
for this day my whole life.

1043
00:43:17.411 --> 00:43:20.180
All right.

1044
00:43:23.083 --> 00:43:24.551
Archie?

1045
00:43:30.657 --> 00:43:32.602
All right, then.

1046
00:43:32.626 --> 00:43:34.695
Let's get started.

1047
00:43:39.032 --> 00:43:40.643
Hey, what you doin' up?

1048
00:43:40.667 --> 00:43:44.147
You know how late it is?

1049
00:43:44.171 --> 00:43:46.182
You know somethin', Daddy?

1050
00:43:46.206 --> 00:43:48.084
What, Brooks?

1051
00:43:48.108 --> 00:43:52.355
I'm scared.

1052
00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:54.157
Well, I could think of

1053
00:43:54.181 --> 00:43:55.258
two reasons why

1054
00:43:55.282 --> 00:43:57.093
you should be scared.

1055
00:43:57.117 --> 00:43:58.294
Only two?

1056
00:43:58.318 --> 00:43:59.495
Only two. That's all I got,

1057
00:43:59.519 --> 00:44:01.297
but they're some good ones.

1058
00:44:01.321 --> 00:44:03.232
Your grandma, she always used

1059
00:44:03.256 --> 00:44:04.168
to tell me,

1060
00:44:04.192 --> 00:44:06.135
God is on your shoulder,

1061
00:44:06.159 --> 00:44:07.537
God is on your shoulder.

1062
00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:12.608
Right now, I can feel Him

1063
00:44:12.632 --> 00:44:16.579
here and here.

1064
00:44:16.603 --> 00:44:20.216
What's the other?

1065
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.452
I'm a big strong man, right?

1066
00:44:22.476 --> 00:44:24.120
And I would never let

1067
00:44:24.144 --> 00:44:28.591
anybody hurt you, hear?

1068
00:44:28.615 --> 00:44:31.627
Get back in bed.

1069
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:35.055
Go, go.

1070
00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:39.602
Love you, boy.

1071
00:44:39.626 --> 00:44:41.595
Love you too, Daddy.

1072
00:44:46.566 --> 00:44:47.543
To help protect

1073
00:44:47.567 --> 00:44:49.045
both the black and the white

1074
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:51.581
popu... oh, no, no, no.

1075
00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:52.749
I don't want any guns,

1076
00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:53.816
any baseball bats.

1077
00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.817
You want us to go?

1078
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:55.685
That's not what he's saying.

1079
00:44:55.709 --> 00:44:56.552
That is exactly

1080
00:44:56.576 --> 00:44:57.420
what I'm saying.

1081
00:44:57.444 --> 00:44:58.288
Mr. Clay, this movement is

1082
00:44:58.312 --> 00:44:59.288
nonviolent and we will

1083
00:44:59.312 --> 00:45:00.189
not resort to this!

1084
00:45:00.213 --> 00:45:01.058
You ain't resortin'

1085
00:45:01.082 --> 00:45:02.759
to a damn thing! We are!

1086
00:45:02.783 --> 00:45:04.227
As long as you stand down here

1087
00:45:04.251 --> 00:45:05.328
and run these protests and

1088
00:45:05.352 --> 00:45:06.729
my daughter's marching in 'em,

1089
00:45:06.753 --> 00:45:08.698
we gonna keep you alive.

1090
00:45:08.722 --> 00:45:10.233
Well, then we won't march.

1091
00:45:10.257 --> 00:45:11.334
We'll call it off.

1092
00:45:11.358 --> 00:45:12.201
I'll pack up.

1093
00:45:12.225 --> 00:45:13.102
No, you won't.

1094
00:45:13.126 --> 00:45:13.770
Maybe we should compromise,

1095
00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:14.637
Michael, need some kind of

1096
00:45:14.661 --> 00:45:15.505
protection...

1097
00:45:15.529 --> 00:45:16.372
Walt, Billy, John,

1098
00:45:16.396 --> 00:45:17.241
you keep 'em company.

1099
00:45:17.265 --> 00:45:18.307
In four hours, you get relieved.

1100
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:19.209
You know what, Marcus?

1101
00:45:19.233 --> 00:45:20.410
You can go to hell!

1102
00:45:20.434 --> 00:45:22.578
Nonviolence is the essence

1103
00:45:22.602 --> 00:45:23.480
of everything

1104
00:45:23.504 --> 00:45:24.614
this movement stands for.

1105
00:45:24.638 --> 00:45:25.482
It is the essence

1106
00:45:25.506 --> 00:45:28.785
of everything I stand for!

1107
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:29.753
We are supposed

1108
00:45:29.777 --> 00:45:30.853
to be better than them.

1109
00:45:30.877 --> 00:45:31.789
If we stay alive,

1110
00:45:31.813 --> 00:45:33.322
we will be better than them.

1111
00:45:33.346 --> 00:45:34.590
That's how I measure it.

1112
00:45:34.614 --> 00:45:36.292
Alive is better than dead!

1113
00:45:36.316 --> 00:45:37.727
And, by the way,

1114
00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:39.095
I'm already in hell.

1115
00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:39.762
So don't you tell me about

1116
00:45:39.786 --> 00:45:40.631
the essence of

1117
00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:41.664
your summer vacation.

1118
00:45:41.688 --> 00:45:42.633
The colored man been wading

1119
00:45:42.657 --> 00:45:44.400
in this shit for 400 years.

1120
00:45:44.424 --> 00:45:45.635
You come down here to my town,

1121
00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:46.503
try to tell me how

1122
00:45:46.527 --> 00:45:48.304
to fight my fight?

1123
00:45:48.328 --> 00:45:50.597
My fight?

1124
00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:55.678
We'll be around

1125
00:45:55.702 --> 00:45:57.113
every 10 minutes.

1126
00:45:57.137 --> 00:46:00.483
You got your whistle?

1127
00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:05.721
What's that under your leg?

1128
00:46:05.745 --> 00:46:07.356
Good for you.

1129
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.393
So this how we gonna live?

1130
00:46:10.417 --> 00:46:11.494
For now, unless you

1131
00:46:11.518 --> 00:46:12.429
know something else.

1132
00:46:12.453 --> 00:46:13.830
You're telling me I got

1133
00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:15.398
to choose between my children

1134
00:46:15.422 --> 00:46:16.366
growing up with dignity

1135
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.167
or a life of my husband?

1136
00:46:18.191 --> 00:46:20.470
I don't know an answer for that.

1137
00:46:20.494 --> 00:46:25.475
Rose, I gotta go.

1138
00:46:25.499 --> 00:46:27.801
Go on then.

1139
00:46:53.527 --> 00:46:55.771
Go! Go! Go!

1140
00:46:55.795 --> 00:46:57.173
Go on now.

1141
00:46:57.197 --> 00:47:00.643
Here we go!

1142
00:47:00.667 --> 00:47:02.945
Get back in the damn car!

1143
00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:05.205
Don't even turn around.

1144
00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:09.486
You're outta

1145
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:10.653
your mind, Marcus.

1146
00:47:10.677 --> 00:47:12.255
Shut your mouth!

1147
00:47:12.279 --> 00:47:13.923
That sheet ain't gonna hide

1148
00:47:13.947 --> 00:47:14.858
what a fat piece of shit

1149
00:47:14.882 --> 00:47:16.292
you are, Kenner.

1150
00:47:16.316 --> 00:47:17.717
Give it here!

1151
00:47:23.323 --> 00:47:24.667
You tell your Grand Wizard,

1152
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:26.469
Poobah Dragon, whatever

1153
00:47:26.493 --> 00:47:27.770
the fuck he calls hisself,

1154
00:47:27.794 --> 00:47:29.238
come down this area again,

1155
00:47:29.262 --> 00:47:32.775
he gonna get a whuppin'.

1156
00:47:32.799 --> 00:47:33.677
Now you boys should

1157
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:34.810
get the hell outta here.

1158
00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:36.412
Shut up or I'll beat

1159
00:47:36.436 --> 00:47:37.446
your ass right now!

1160
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:38.848
We ain't like y'all.

1161
00:47:38.872 --> 00:47:41.584
Get the hell on outta here.

1162
00:47:41.608 --> 00:47:42.452
Just drive yourself

1163
00:47:42.476 --> 00:47:43.910
on outta here!

1164
00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:56.599
Boy, do you know what

1165
00:47:56.623 --> 00:47:57.667
we just done?

1166
00:47:57.691 --> 00:47:59.902
And I lived to see that day.

1167
00:47:59.926 --> 00:48:02.471
Phew, thank you, Lord.

1168
00:48:02.495 --> 00:48:03.440
Like deacons

1169
00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:04.640
defending they church.

1170
00:48:04.664 --> 00:48:06.409
That was righteous.

1171
00:48:06.433 --> 00:48:07.610
What y'all think

1172
00:48:07.634 --> 00:48:08.611
about the name

1173
00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:09.812
the Deacons for Defense

1174
00:48:09.836 --> 00:48:11.714
and Justice?

1175
00:48:11.738 --> 00:48:13.449
Deacons for Defense.

1176
00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:15.585
Makes sense to me.

1177
00:48:15.609 --> 00:48:16.652
It's a righteous name

1178
00:48:16.676 --> 00:48:18.020
for a righteous cause.

1179
00:48:18.044 --> 00:48:19.655
I like it.

1180
00:48:19.679 --> 00:48:22.491
The Deacons for Defense.

1181
00:48:22.515 --> 00:48:23.427
Now why won't you let

1182
00:48:23.451 --> 00:48:24.627
Chief Neely arrest 'em?

1183
00:48:24.651 --> 00:48:25.628
We know the names

1184
00:48:25.652 --> 00:48:26.530
of most of them.

1185
00:48:26.554 --> 00:48:27.663
Not only did

1186
00:48:27.687 --> 00:48:28.931
they assault white men,

1187
00:48:28.955 --> 00:48:31.434
but those Negroes have guns.

1188
00:48:31.458 --> 00:48:33.603
William, you're a teacher,

1189
00:48:33.627 --> 00:48:35.271
an intelligent man.

1190
00:48:35.295 --> 00:48:36.772
You know what was going on

1191
00:48:36.796 --> 00:48:37.873
out there tonight.

1192
00:48:37.897 --> 00:48:39.475
Now do we have

1193
00:48:39.499 --> 00:48:40.344
to say it out loud?

1194
00:48:40.368 --> 00:48:41.978
We need to control them.

1195
00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:43.479
Now if you can't do it

1196
00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:44.747
with the hand of government,

1197
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:46.682
it is our obligation,

1198
00:48:46.706 --> 00:48:48.718
our divine right,

1199
00:48:48.742 --> 00:48:50.486
to lord it over the beasts.

1200
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:51.921
Let's get those white boys,

1201
00:48:51.945 --> 00:48:52.955
Deane and Hillibrand,

1202
00:48:52.979 --> 00:48:53.890
out at least.

1203
00:48:53.914 --> 00:48:55.558
Those boys are communists.

1204
00:48:55.582 --> 00:48:56.459
Just say the word

1205
00:48:56.483 --> 00:48:57.394
and we'll bring 'em in.

1206
00:48:57.418 --> 00:48:58.694
They have cars down there

1207
00:48:58.718 --> 00:49:00.463
from Baton Rouge in New Orleans.

1208
00:49:00.487 --> 00:49:01.897
There are white reporters,

1209
00:49:01.921 --> 00:49:03.633
Negro reporters.

1210
00:49:03.657 --> 00:49:04.967
There's Life magazine.

1211
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:07.036
If we arrest Deane or

1212
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.571
Hillibrand, those reporters

1213
00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:09.905
will be all over it

1214
00:49:09.929 --> 00:49:11.040
and we don't even have anything

1215
00:49:11.064 --> 00:49:12.441
to charge 'em with.

1216
00:49:12.465 --> 00:49:13.377
So what if

1217
00:49:13.401 --> 00:49:14.644
they're just missing?

1218
00:49:14.668 --> 00:49:15.711
Well, after what happened

1219
00:49:15.735 --> 00:49:17.780
in Mississippi, you want

1220
00:49:17.804 --> 00:49:18.914
the FBI down here?

1221
00:49:18.938 --> 00:49:21.851
Sam, I'm just about 13 days

1222
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:23.686
away from bankruptcy.

1223
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.521
Why can't we just fire 'em,

1224
00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:27.390
take away their income?

1225
00:49:27.414 --> 00:49:28.557
Who?

1226
00:49:28.581 --> 00:49:29.992
All the Negroes at the plant?

1227
00:49:30.016 --> 00:49:31.527
You mean shut down

1228
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:32.428
the cornerstone of the economy

1229
00:49:32.452 --> 00:49:33.096
of this town?

1230
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.730
So not the plant.

1231
00:49:34.754 --> 00:49:35.865
There are other jobs.

1232
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.333
Every person who cleans

1233
00:49:37.357 --> 00:49:38.901
a toilet or takes care of your

1234
00:49:38.925 --> 00:49:40.536
children or cooks your food

1235
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.672
or fixes the brakes on your car,

1236
00:49:42.696 --> 00:49:43.572
one-third of

1237
00:49:43.596 --> 00:49:44.508
this town is Negroes.

1238
00:49:44.532 --> 00:49:45.541
They're everywhere.

1239
00:49:45.565 --> 00:49:46.676
So you tell me who

1240
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.843
to fire first.

1241
00:49:47.867 --> 00:49:48.812
You make it sound

1242
00:49:48.836 --> 00:49:49.879
like we should be scared.

1243
00:49:49.903 --> 00:49:50.813
You know who made

1244
00:49:50.837 --> 00:49:51.715
that sandwich?

1245
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:54.383
Poured that water?

1246
00:49:54.407 --> 00:49:56.352
The Klan can deliver

1247
00:49:56.376 --> 00:49:57.353
a lot of votes and we can

1248
00:49:57.377 --> 00:49:58.788
take a lot of votes away.

1249
00:49:58.812 --> 00:50:00.956
Well, then don't vote for me,

1250
00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.358
William, all right?

1251
00:50:02.382 --> 00:50:04.694
Now, look, give a list

1252
00:50:04.718 --> 00:50:06.028
of names to Neely.

1253
00:50:06.052 --> 00:50:07.063
He'll go out and check

1254
00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:07.931
that they have permits

1255
00:50:07.955 --> 00:50:09.065
for their weapons.

1256
00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:10.599
He'll check their cars

1257
00:50:10.623 --> 00:50:11.734
for violations.

1258
00:50:11.758 --> 00:50:13.069
But other than that,

1259
00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:15.438
I can't help you.

1260
00:50:15.462 --> 00:50:19.642
Well, gentlemen,

1261
00:50:19.666 --> 00:50:22.812
I will weed this field myself.

1262
00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:24.013
I'm bringing in Klansmen

1263
00:50:24.037 --> 00:50:25.147
from all over the state.

1264
00:50:25.171 --> 00:50:26.816
Now this is a crisis.

1265
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.983
Those Negroes have

1266
00:50:28.007 --> 00:50:29.051
formed an army.

1267
00:50:29.075 --> 00:50:31.153
If they succeed here, think

1268
00:50:31.177 --> 00:50:34.623
they won't do this in Alabama?

1269
00:50:34.647 --> 00:50:35.925
Seems like it's growing.

1270
00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:36.793
Best guess, there's more

1271
00:50:36.817 --> 00:50:37.827
than 30 of 'em now.

1272
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:39.028
Their leader's definitely

1273
00:50:39.052 --> 00:50:40.496
Marcus Clay.

1274
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.531
He's like a rabid animal

1275
00:50:42.555 --> 00:50:44.867
that's completely uncontrollable

1276
00:50:44.891 --> 00:50:47.636
and needs to be put down.

1277
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.038
Now who would like

1278
00:50:49.062 --> 00:50:51.431
that privilege?

1279
00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:04.987
We started with five men.

1280
00:51:05.011 --> 00:51:05.988
Now look at us.

1281
00:51:06.012 --> 00:51:08.057
Larger, stronger!

1282
00:51:08.081 --> 00:51:09.158
Let me hear it!

1283
00:51:09.182 --> 00:51:10.793
Yes, sir!

1284
00:51:10.817 --> 00:51:11.695
Each squad stays within

1285
00:51:11.719 --> 00:51:12.828
100-yards of the other squad.

1286
00:51:12.852 --> 00:51:13.896
Use your whistles.

1287
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.197
Don't start talking or

1288
00:51:15.221 --> 00:51:16.932
bunching up with other squads.

1289
00:51:16.956 --> 00:51:18.501
Use your eyes.

1290
00:51:18.525 --> 00:51:19.869
See them before they see you.

1291
00:51:19.893 --> 00:51:21.203
All right, let's go.

1292
00:51:21.227 --> 00:51:22.772
Never again!

1293
00:51:22.796 --> 00:51:23.939
Never again!

1294
00:51:23.963 --> 00:51:25.040
'Til peace comes at last!

1295
00:51:25.064 --> 00:51:26.709
'Til peace comes at last!

1296
00:51:26.733 --> 00:51:27.611
Deacons for Defense!

1297
00:51:27.635 --> 00:51:28.677
Deacons for Defense!

1298
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:29.712
Deacons for Defense!

1299
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:35.874
Go to!

1300
00:52:36.202 --> 00:52:40.249
When we met, we was always

1301
00:52:40.273 --> 00:52:44.587
laughing and joking.

1302
00:52:44.611 --> 00:52:49.592
We was closer.

1303
00:52:49.616 --> 00:52:54.230
What happened?

1304
00:52:54.254 --> 00:52:59.702
Our kids got big.

1305
00:52:59.726 --> 00:53:04.273
I look at 'em and I get scared.

1306
00:53:04.297 --> 00:53:06.742
I don't think I could live

1307
00:53:06.766 --> 00:53:11.547
if they got hurt.

1308
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:12.249
I'd rather die than

1309
00:53:12.273 --> 00:53:17.953
let anything happen to them.

1310
00:53:17.977 --> 00:53:18.822
Let the white man

1311
00:53:18.846 --> 00:53:19.855
do whatever he wants,

1312
00:53:19.879 --> 00:53:24.994
just don't hurt my babies.

1313
00:53:25.018 --> 00:53:28.197
Walk all over me.

1314
00:53:28.221 --> 00:53:35.271
Just don't hurt them.

1315
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.739
I been telling myself

1316
00:53:36.763 --> 00:53:42.011
that for years,

1317
00:53:42.035 --> 00:53:45.038
but it's over.

1318
00:53:50.877 --> 00:53:53.589
You gotta keep yourself safe,

1319
00:53:53.613 --> 00:53:55.824
Marcus Clay,

1320
00:53:55.848 --> 00:53:58.193
'cause I need you.

1321
00:53:58.217 --> 00:54:00.696
They might kill me, Rose.

1322
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.698
Until that happens,

1323
00:54:02.722 --> 00:54:04.667
I'm gonna love you.

1324
00:54:04.691 --> 00:54:05.968
I love our kids.

1325
00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:08.370
I'm gonna love God

1326
00:54:08.394 --> 00:54:11.206
and I'm gonna live

1327
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:16.169
like a man, like a man does.

1328
00:54:20.673 --> 00:54:25.988
For all that time I didn't,

1329
00:54:26.012 --> 00:54:28.348
I'm so sorry.

1330
00:54:31.217 --> 00:54:34.163
I've missed you so much.

1331
00:54:34.187 --> 00:54:36.231
You are something else.

1332
00:54:36.255 --> 00:54:38.767
You know that?

1333
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:41.260
I love you.

1334
00:54:43.062 --> 00:54:46.265
I'm back.

1335
00:55:08.354 --> 00:55:09.698
Patterson Paper employs 40%

1336
00:55:09.722 --> 00:55:11.000
of the people of Bogalusa.

1337
00:55:11.024 --> 00:55:12.301
The way Patterson Paper goes,

1338
00:55:12.325 --> 00:55:14.203
so goes this city.

1339
00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:16.305
We do not control this city.

1340
00:55:16.329 --> 00:55:17.740
Yes, you do.

1341
00:55:17.764 --> 00:55:18.408
Two of the five members

1342
00:55:18.432 --> 00:55:19.675
of City Council

1343
00:55:19.699 --> 00:55:21.210
are Patterson Paper employees.

1344
00:55:21.234 --> 00:55:22.745
70% of the income of Bogalusa

1345
00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:24.847
comes from Patterson Paper.

1346
00:55:24.871 --> 00:55:26.115
What's your point?

1347
00:55:26.139 --> 00:55:28.150
One, you've never hired

1348
00:55:28.174 --> 00:55:29.752
any female Negroes to work

1349
00:55:29.776 --> 00:55:30.953
in this factory.

1350
00:55:30.977 --> 00:55:32.688
Two, all the work spaces

1351
00:55:32.712 --> 00:55:33.789
are segregated.

1352
00:55:33.813 --> 00:55:35.724
Three, Negro workers have

1353
00:55:35.748 --> 00:55:37.292
passed aptitude and skill tests

1354
00:55:37.316 --> 00:55:38.994
and still can't progress

1355
00:55:39.018 --> 00:55:40.362
past the lowest paying jobs.

1356
00:55:40.386 --> 00:55:41.363
Marcus, let me stop you

1357
00:55:41.387 --> 00:55:42.765
for one second here.

1358
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:43.932
I've known you for a long time

1359
00:55:43.956 --> 00:55:45.834
and I respect your position

1360
00:55:45.858 --> 00:55:47.803
as head of the Voters League.

1361
00:55:47.827 --> 00:55:49.872
But it's gonna take some time.

1362
00:55:49.896 --> 00:55:50.873
We're just one little

1363
00:55:50.897 --> 00:55:51.774
factory here.

1364
00:55:51.798 --> 00:55:52.741
Don't fool with us,

1365
00:55:52.765 --> 00:55:53.476
Mr. Gower.

1366
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.743
You are part of the 88th

1367
00:55:54.767 --> 00:55:56.111
largest corporation

1368
00:55:56.135 --> 00:55:57.346
in the United States.

1369
00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:59.415
You have net sales of

1370
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:01.016
$616 million with assets

1371
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.318
of over $645 million.

1372
00:56:03.342 --> 00:56:04.420
Really?

1373
00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:05.454
I didn't even know that.

1374
00:56:05.478 --> 00:56:07.089
Shall we bring the unfair

1375
00:56:07.113 --> 00:56:08.290
promotional practices and the

1376
00:56:08.314 --> 00:56:09.324
illegal segregated workplaces

1377
00:56:09.348 --> 00:56:10.259
to the attention

1378
00:56:10.283 --> 00:56:11.227
of the national media?

1379
00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:12.228
Is that what it's gonna take?

1380
00:56:12.252 --> 00:56:14.329
No Negro workers have ever

1381
00:56:14.353 --> 00:56:15.998
moved up to the position of

1382
00:56:16.022 --> 00:56:19.935
truck driver or supervisor.

1383
00:56:19.959 --> 00:56:21.070
T. J. McDaniels

1384
00:56:21.094 --> 00:56:22.304
was beaten simply for

1385
00:56:22.328 --> 00:56:24.773
putting his name on the list.

1386
00:56:24.797 --> 00:56:25.774
We don't know anything

1387
00:56:25.798 --> 00:56:26.775
about that!

1388
00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:27.976
What?

1389
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.279
Look, it's a very nice idea

1390
00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:31.747
to have a colored man

1391
00:56:31.771 --> 00:56:32.915
as a supervisor.

1392
00:56:32.939 --> 00:56:34.283
But it would mean at some

1393
00:56:34.307 --> 00:56:36.218
point that he would have

1394
00:56:36.242 --> 00:56:37.519
to supervise white men.

1395
00:56:37.543 --> 00:56:39.521
You see, Patterson Paper

1396
00:56:39.545 --> 00:56:41.457
corporate headquarters...

1397
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:42.424
Is in Seattle.

1398
00:56:42.448 --> 00:56:43.292
I've already written

1399
00:56:43.316 --> 00:56:44.160
to two vice presidents

1400
00:56:44.184 --> 00:56:45.327
in charge of hiring there.

1401
00:56:45.351 --> 00:56:47.296
Well, then you know that

1402
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.430
company policy dictates that

1403
00:56:48.454 --> 00:56:50.065
Patterson will not go against

1404
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:52.067
any local customs, no matter

1405
00:56:52.091 --> 00:56:53.435
how offensive or

1406
00:56:53.459 --> 00:56:54.903
repugnant we personally

1407
00:56:54.927 --> 00:56:56.271
may feel them to be.

1408
00:56:56.295 --> 00:56:57.973
I see. You're right.

1409
00:56:57.997 --> 00:56:59.174
Because where I come from

1410
00:56:59.198 --> 00:57:00.809
up north in Philadelphia,

1411
00:57:00.833 --> 00:57:02.077
we like to drown

1412
00:57:02.101 --> 00:57:04.379
redneck racists like cats.

1413
00:57:04.403 --> 00:57:06.181
So that would be okay, right?

1414
00:57:06.205 --> 00:57:07.182
No matter how offensive

1415
00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:08.817
or repugnant it happens to be?

1416
00:57:08.841 --> 00:57:09.552
Because that's just

1417
00:57:09.576 --> 00:57:10.853
the way it is around here!

1418
00:57:10.877 --> 00:57:12.221
You can leave.

1419
00:57:12.245 --> 00:57:13.189
Yes, sir.

1420
00:57:13.213 --> 00:57:14.490
I promise you, Mr. Gower,

1421
00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:18.560
we will shut this place down!

1422
00:57:18.584 --> 00:57:19.828
You better talk to him,

1423
00:57:19.852 --> 00:57:20.829
Marcus.

1424
00:57:20.853 --> 00:57:21.964
This is out of hand.

1425
00:57:21.988 --> 00:57:23.365
I think you better...

1426
00:57:23.389 --> 00:57:24.234
I think you better

1427
00:57:24.258 --> 00:57:25.434
listen to him.

1428
00:57:25.458 --> 00:57:26.435
I seen him drown

1429
00:57:26.459 --> 00:57:28.504
three rednecks already.

1430
00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:29.571
Bubbles coming up out

1431
00:57:29.595 --> 00:57:30.939
the water and whatnot.

1432
00:57:30.963 --> 00:57:32.307
It was awful.

1433
00:57:32.331 --> 00:57:34.500
It was downright ugly.

1434
00:57:36.269 --> 00:57:37.946
Jim, I'm standing here

1435
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:39.248
at the north entrance

1436
00:57:39.272 --> 00:57:41.083
to the Patterson Paper Company.

1437
00:57:41.107 --> 00:57:42.584
Now, as you can see, we have

1438
00:57:42.608 --> 00:57:44.553
a large group massing right here

1439
00:57:44.577 --> 00:57:46.455
in front of the main gate.

1440
00:57:46.479 --> 00:57:48.323
As I understand it, there's

1441
00:57:48.347 --> 00:57:49.191
already been...

1442
00:57:49.215 --> 00:57:50.059
Just blocks from where

1443
00:57:50.083 --> 00:57:51.527
I'm standing, a large protest

1444
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:52.861
has completely shut down

1445
00:57:52.885 --> 00:57:54.163
Patterson Paper.

1446
00:57:54.187 --> 00:57:56.098
This is a massive factory and

1447
00:57:56.122 --> 00:57:57.065
there are trucks backed up

1448
00:57:57.089 --> 00:57:58.034
for several blocks that

1449
00:57:58.058 --> 00:57:59.568
the protestors aren't allowing

1450
00:57:59.592 --> 00:58:01.503
into the factory.

1451
00:58:02.628 --> 00:58:03.573
Yeah?

1452
00:58:03.597 --> 00:58:04.606
Sir, the national press

1453
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.441
is here and we've got pickets

1454
00:58:06.465 --> 00:58:07.843
in front of our building.

1455
00:58:07.867 --> 00:58:08.510
Pickets?

1456
00:58:08.534 --> 00:58:09.445
And we're on goddamned

1457
00:58:09.469 --> 00:58:13.048
national television.

1458
00:58:13.072 --> 00:58:15.417
Get me the plant at Bogalusa.

1459
00:58:15.441 --> 00:58:16.451
The order's come down

1460
00:58:16.475 --> 00:58:18.153
from national headquarters

1461
00:58:18.177 --> 00:58:19.888
in Seattle.

1462
00:58:19.912 --> 00:58:21.523
We are going to be making

1463
00:58:21.547 --> 00:58:23.492
some changes around the plant.

1464
00:58:23.516 --> 00:58:26.094
From now on, all segregation

1465
00:58:26.118 --> 00:58:27.229
in the plant

1466
00:58:27.253 --> 00:58:30.098
is to be discontinued.

1467
00:58:30.122 --> 00:58:31.400
We're gonna share

1468
00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:32.568
the bathrooms with the coloreds?

1469
00:58:32.592 --> 00:58:33.503
Yes. The bathrooms

1470
00:58:33.527 --> 00:58:35.170
will be desegregated.

1471
00:58:35.194 --> 00:58:39.608
This is the letter from Seattle.

1472
00:58:39.632 --> 00:58:41.243
"Effective immediately,

1473
00:58:41.267 --> 00:58:44.313
all areas will be permanently

1474
00:58:44.337 --> 00:58:46.448
desegregated, not limited to,

1475
00:58:46.472 --> 00:58:48.984
but including the cafeteria,

1476
00:58:49.008 --> 00:58:51.453
workplaces, water fountains,

1477
00:58:51.477 --> 00:58:53.555
locker rooms and restrooms."

1478
00:58:55.314 --> 00:58:56.226
This is by order of

1479
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.659
the company president

1480
00:58:57.683 --> 00:58:58.528
and approved by

1481
00:58:58.552 --> 00:59:02.297
the Board of Directors.

1482
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:31.393
I'm sending you this letter

1483
00:59:31.417 --> 00:59:32.362
with the greatest urgency...

1484
00:59:32.386 --> 00:59:34.496
Luke, you're replaced.

1485
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.298
Frankie, take his place.

1486
00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:38.367
Listen, I really appreciate

1487
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:39.234
everything you've done for us,

1488
00:59:39.258 --> 00:59:40.102
but...

1489
00:59:40.126 --> 00:59:40.969
Just watching out

1490
00:59:40.993 --> 00:59:41.637
for my daughter.

1491
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:42.504
Well, with all due respect,

1492
00:59:42.528 --> 00:59:43.372
Mr. Clay, you might wanna

1493
00:59:43.396 --> 00:59:44.239
try talking to her.

1494
00:59:44.263 --> 00:59:45.107
She'd like it if you

1495
00:59:45.131 --> 00:59:45.974
communicated with her

1496
00:59:45.998 --> 00:59:46.642
a little bit.

1497
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:47.509
She would?

1498
00:59:47.533 --> 00:59:48.377
Very much so.

1499
00:59:48.401 --> 00:59:49.244
She understands a lot more about

1500
00:59:49.268 --> 00:59:50.113
you than you think she does.

1501
00:59:50.137 --> 00:59:51.213
If I were you, 
I wouldn't get

1502
00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:53.515
involved in my family business.

1503
00:59:53.539 --> 00:59:54.484
Dangerous and violent

1504
00:59:54.508 --> 00:59:56.585
situations brewing.

1505
00:59:56.609 --> 00:59:57.686
Armed factions, we request

1506
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:58.554
that federal troops be brought

1507
00:59:58.578 --> 01:00:00.055
to Bogalusa to help both

1508
01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:02.257
the black and white population.

1509
01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:04.192
You scared?

1510
01:00:04.216 --> 01:00:05.661
As scared as I've ever been.

1511
01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:06.995
The letter's right.

1512
01:00:07.019 --> 01:00:08.463
Somebody gonna need protectin'.

1513
01:00:08.487 --> 01:00:10.198
Let's go.

1514
01:00:10.222 --> 01:00:12.634
Tremendous urgency.

1515
01:00:12.658 --> 01:00:14.636
This is not simply a request.

1516
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.695
It is a plea.

1517
01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:19.541
You got a minute?

1518
01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:20.565
Yeah.

1519
01:00:22.001 --> 01:00:23.378
Did you get my memo

1520
01:00:23.402 --> 01:00:24.579
on Bogalusa?

1521
01:00:24.603 --> 01:00:26.114
Yes, I did.

1522
01:00:26.138 --> 01:00:27.349
You have confirmation?

1523
01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:28.450
We sent in

1524
01:00:28.474 --> 01:00:30.185
some state police undercover

1525
01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:31.987
and they confirmed it for us.

1526
01:00:32.011 --> 01:00:34.156
There is a war heating up

1527
01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.024
down there.

1528
01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.425
There are Negroes

1529
01:00:36.449 --> 01:00:37.592
taking up arms.

1530
01:00:37.616 --> 01:00:39.194
Now the KKK is already

1531
01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:40.996
well-armed and well-financed

1532
01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.631
by the White Citizens Council

1533
01:00:42.655 --> 01:00:44.132
and they're organizing.

1534
01:00:44.156 --> 01:00:46.401
We believe there are hundreds

1535
01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:47.270
of KKK members coming

1536
01:00:47.294 --> 01:00:51.273
into the area.

1537
01:00:51.297 --> 01:00:53.175
You know where Bogalusa is?

1538
01:00:53.199 --> 01:00:54.443
No.

1539
01:00:54.467 --> 01:00:55.610
I had to look
it up on a map.

1540
01:00:55.634 --> 01:00:56.712
You heard national press

1541
01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:57.580
about this before

1542
01:00:57.604 --> 01:00:58.647
you started your investigation?

1543
01:00:58.671 --> 01:00:59.781
No, I didn't.

1544
01:00:59.805 --> 01:01:00.649
But, listen now,

1545
01:01:00.673 --> 01:01:01.550
this is different.

1546
01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:02.451
There is a militant

1547
01:01:02.475 --> 01:01:03.386
Negro group that is armed

1548
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.419
and ready to fight.

1549
01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:05.287
That's only happened

1550
01:01:05.311 --> 01:01:06.254
a few times before.

1551
01:01:06.278 --> 01:01:07.190
There are two armies

1552
01:01:07.214 --> 01:01:08.390
gathering down there.

1553
01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:09.258
Johnson just got

1554
01:01:09.282 --> 01:01:10.425
the National Civil Rights Bill

1555
01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:11.626
through Congress.

1556
01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.794
He's done enough damage

1557
01:01:12.818 --> 01:01:13.762
to the south.

1558
01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:14.731
He's a southerner,

1559
01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:15.732
for God's sake.

1560
01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.265
He needs those states.

1561
01:01:17.289 --> 01:01:18.400
He's not gonna let us send

1562
01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:19.369
troops down there

1563
01:01:19.393 --> 01:01:21.269
unless it's called for.

1564
01:01:21.293 --> 01:01:22.205
Well, what about

1565
01:01:22.229 --> 01:01:23.206
the people of the city?

1566
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:24.473
The white people and

1567
01:01:24.497 --> 01:01:25.774
the colored people?

1568
01:01:25.798 --> 01:01:27.576
When that war breaks out,

1569
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.044
what happens then?

1570
01:01:29.068 --> 01:01:31.771
God help 'em.

1571
01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.268
Brothers, please.

1572
01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:54.636
Please!

1573
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.304
Now we have a white company

1574
01:01:56.328 --> 01:01:57.439
like Patterson Paper

1575
01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:58.607
telling us how

1576
01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:02.210
to run our lives!

1577
01:02:02.234 --> 01:02:03.812
Taking our jobs.

1578
01:02:03.836 --> 01:02:05.113
Spreading communism and

1579
01:02:05.137 --> 01:02:08.683
niggerism to our community.

1580
01:02:08.707 --> 01:02:10.819
They're taking our way of life!

1581
01:02:10.843 --> 01:02:14.623
Klan, I ask you to stand tall,

1582
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:17.192
stand proud,

1583
01:02:17.216 --> 01:02:20.195
exalt in your whiteness,

1584
01:02:20.219 --> 01:02:23.365
in your intelligence,

1585
01:02:23.389 --> 01:02:27.335
in your superiority.

1586
01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:31.273
It's our turn now.

1587
01:02:31.297 --> 01:02:33.875
White power reign down

1588
01:02:33.899 --> 01:02:37.179
on this great country of ours.

1589
01:02:37.203 --> 01:02:38.147
White power!

1590
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.281
White power!

1591
01:02:39.305 --> 01:02:40.182
White power!

1592
01:02:40.206 --> 01:02:41.206
White power!

1593
01:03:26.285 --> 01:03:28.563
Three homes burned, Marcus.

1594
01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:31.533
45 wounded, 35 hospitalized,

1595
01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:33.401
six of them children.

1596
01:03:33.425 --> 01:03:34.269
One woman was stripped down

1597
01:03:34.293 --> 01:03:34.937
in front of her daughter.

1598
01:03:34.961 --> 01:03:36.204
She didn't say what

1599
01:03:36.228 --> 01:03:37.439
all they did to her.

1600
01:03:37.463 --> 01:03:38.573
By the grace of God,

1601
01:03:38.597 --> 01:03:39.875
nobody died.

1602
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.409
This only works, Marcus,

1603
01:03:41.433 --> 01:03:42.611
if we carrying

1604
01:03:42.635 --> 01:03:43.678
a bigger stick as they do.

1605
01:03:43.702 --> 01:03:44.579
We lost tonight,

1606
01:03:44.603 --> 01:03:45.448
but I know we...

1607
01:03:45.472 --> 01:03:46.615
We reassign the men,

1608
01:03:46.639 --> 01:03:47.482
fill up for the wounded,

1609
01:03:47.506 --> 01:03:48.350
even up the scores.

1610
01:03:48.374 --> 01:03:49.217
That's what we do.

1611
01:03:49.241 --> 01:03:49.951
We can't fight the Klan.

1612
01:03:49.975 --> 01:03:50.919
Two of my guys were

1613
01:03:50.943 --> 01:03:51.888
throwing rocks at 'em.

1614
01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:53.788
Rocks, Marcus, against guns!

1615
01:03:53.812 --> 01:03:54.656
We put more men

1616
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.590
on the perimeter.

1617
01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:56.491
Put more men on patrol

1618
01:03:56.515 --> 01:03:57.360
at the same time.

1619
01:03:57.384 --> 01:03:58.894
Marcus, we can't do this!

1620
01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.428
Not like this!

1621
01:04:00.452 --> 01:04:01.696
You got a better idea?

1622
01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.565
Three of our neighbors

1623
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.466
lost their homes, man.

1624
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:05.567
This is one night.

1625
01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:06.668
This is what it's about!

1626
01:04:06.692 --> 01:04:07.702
There's gonna be losses!

1627
01:04:07.726 --> 01:04:10.605
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

1628
01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:12.908
We can't go back,

1629
01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:17.612
so let's all take a deep breath.

1630
01:04:17.636 --> 01:04:18.580
I have us a plan.

1631
01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:19.514
There's a gentleman

1632
01:04:19.538 --> 01:04:20.383
I can speak to,

1633
01:04:20.407 --> 01:04:21.750
an old Army buddy

1634
01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:22.918
in New Orleans.

1635
01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.252
Who is he?

1636
01:04:24.276 --> 01:04:25.587
He runs the Negro

1637
01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:27.489
Longshoremen's Union.

1638
01:04:27.513 --> 01:04:28.823
What we talking about, Otis?

1639
01:04:28.847 --> 01:04:30.358
I'm talking about

1640
01:04:30.382 --> 01:04:31.560
building up.

1641
01:04:31.584 --> 01:04:33.962
I'm talking about real weapons.

1642
01:04:33.986 --> 01:04:36.331
I'm talking about

1643
01:04:36.355 --> 01:04:38.967
arming every one of us.

1644
01:04:38.991 --> 01:04:40.735
Who gonna give guns

1645
01:04:40.759 --> 01:04:42.938
to a mob of angry niggers?

1646
01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:46.508
The white man put us

1647
01:04:46.532 --> 01:04:50.245
to work out in the fields,

1648
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:52.380
in the factories

1649
01:04:52.404 --> 01:04:56.351
and down on the docks.

1650
01:04:56.375 --> 01:05:00.755
Everything for a 1,000 miles

1651
01:05:00.779 --> 01:05:02.424
moves in and out of the docks

1652
01:05:02.448 --> 01:05:04.025
in New Orleans

1653
01:05:04.049 --> 01:05:07.395
and colored men lift half of it.

1654
01:05:07.419 --> 01:05:14.803
Bananas, cars, guns.

1655
01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:19.941
My boy!

1656
01:05:19.965 --> 01:05:21.676
Oh, how you been?

1657
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.711
Good, good, yeah.

1658
01:05:22.735 --> 01:05:23.578
Let's get these cars loaded

1659
01:05:23.602 --> 01:05:24.447
and get the hell

1660
01:05:24.471 --> 01:05:28.416
on outta here, huh?

1661
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.851
I can't take this.

1662
01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:31.019
You give it to the church.

1663
01:05:31.043 --> 01:05:32.921
You sure?

1664
01:05:32.945 --> 01:05:36.391
Give it to the church.

1665
01:05:36.415 --> 01:05:37.626
We thank you.

1666
01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.519
Come on, let's go.

1667
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.501
Marcus, you better

1668
01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:49.804
get over here.

1669
01:05:49.828 --> 01:05:51.039
That's an M-60.

1670
01:05:51.063 --> 01:05:52.974
Shoots 600 rounds per minute.

1671
01:05:52.998 --> 01:05:54.075
Look at these.

1672
01:05:54.099 --> 01:05:55.844
Otis, what is this?

1673
01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:56.945
A weapon.

1674
01:05:56.969 --> 01:05:59.781
What's wrong?

1675
01:05:59.805 --> 01:06:00.716
I been to war already.

1676
01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:01.750
I didn't like it then.

1677
01:06:01.774 --> 01:06:03.084
Marcus, this ain't war.

1678
01:06:03.108 --> 01:06:04.552
We can't use this.

1679
01:06:04.576 --> 01:06:06.554
Comes to it, I'll use it.

1680
01:06:06.578 --> 01:06:07.455
If it comes to it,

1681
01:06:07.479 --> 01:06:08.324
it'll be the end of the world.

1682
01:06:08.348 --> 01:06:09.391
End of our world, at least.

1683
01:06:09.415 --> 01:06:10.091
No, man.

1684
01:06:10.115 --> 01:06:11.027
You hand those out,

1685
01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:12.028
I'm walking away from here.

1686
01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.662
I'm not handing them out.

1687
01:06:13.686 --> 01:06:14.996
Not yet.

1688
01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.732
Otis, put 'em back.

1689
01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:20.059
Put 'em down, Otis.

1690
01:06:22.661 --> 01:06:24.939
You come with me.

1691
01:06:24.963 --> 01:06:27.575
Gentlemen, we are

1692
01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:31.346
not playing games, hmm?

1693
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:34.373
I'm with you on this, Otis.

1694
01:06:40.879 --> 01:06:43.449
Have a seat, Marcus.

1695
01:06:49.555 --> 01:06:50.965
You want something?

1696
01:06:50.989 --> 01:06:53.635
You been missing days.

1697
01:06:53.659 --> 01:06:54.537
There's talk about

1698
01:06:54.561 --> 01:06:55.570
letting you go.

1699
01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:59.941
I covered all my shifts.

1700
01:06:59.965 --> 01:07:02.777
I'm not supposed to say this.

1701
01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:04.145
I'm just telling you

1702
01:07:04.169 --> 01:07:08.049
what's being discussed.

1703
01:07:08.073 --> 01:07:12.010
You're gonna have real trouble.

1704
01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:24.899
All right then.

1705
01:07:24.923 --> 01:07:28.069
I'm just trying to help you.

1706
01:07:28.093 --> 01:07:31.530
Yeah, yeah.

1707
01:07:42.107 --> 01:07:43.685
This letter says they

1708
01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:44.819
sent down two busloads of clergy

1709
01:07:44.843 --> 01:07:46.054
from New York and Detroit.

1710
01:07:46.078 --> 01:07:47.422
I don't see any buses.

1711
01:07:47.446 --> 01:07:48.423
We are here on our own.

1712
01:07:48.447 --> 01:07:49.524
Hold on a second. Hold on!

1713
01:07:49.548 --> 01:07:50.892
There's supposed to be

1714
01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:51.993
a deacon posted here.

1715
01:07:52.017 --> 01:07:53.528
Yeah. Where is he?

1716
01:07:53.552 --> 01:07:55.797
Make me smile.

1717
01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:56.665
Give me a reason

1718
01:07:56.689 --> 01:07:58.566
to pull this trigger.

1719
01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:01.026
Now drop the gun, boy.

1720
01:08:16.742 --> 01:08:19.053
Run, you nigger lovers!

1721
01:08:19.077 --> 01:08:20.588
Run!

1722
01:08:20.612 --> 01:08:21.947
Go!

1723
01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:25.827
Oh, my God, Michael!

1724
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:27.028
It's gonna be all right!

1725
01:08:27.052 --> 01:08:33.735
It's gonna be all right.

1726
01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:36.037
Now you boys were given

1727
01:08:36.061 --> 01:08:38.506
a good Christian warning

1728
01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:40.241
and you just didn't listen.

1729
01:08:40.265 --> 01:08:42.177
Gentlemen, beat 'em with

1730
01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.912
the strength of the Lord

1731
01:08:43.936 --> 01:08:45.680
and the rage of the devil.

1732
01:09:03.088 --> 01:09:04.766
Where's Marcus?

1733
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:05.967
Inside.

1734
01:09:05.991 --> 01:09:07.602
Marcus!

1735
01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:09.003
Marcus!

1736
01:09:09.027 --> 01:09:09.938
They got Carl!

1737
01:09:09.962 --> 01:09:10.805
They got John

1738
01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:11.829
and the white boys!

1739
01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:18.046
They look real bad.

1740
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.914
I'll take 'em to

1741
01:09:18.938 --> 01:09:20.081
the hospital in New Orleans.

1742
01:09:20.105 --> 01:09:21.182
Marcus?

1743
01:09:21.206 --> 01:09:22.784
Two things.

1744
01:09:22.808 --> 01:09:24.219
No more violence,

1745
01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.987
I'm begging you!

1746
01:09:26.011 --> 01:09:27.755
And the other?

1747
01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.757
I'm coming back.

1748
01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:31.059
Move, Archie!

1749
01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:32.060
Take 'em to the hospital.

1750
01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:32.928
Go on.

1751
01:09:32.952 --> 01:09:36.288
Go ahead!

1752
01:09:52.204 --> 01:09:53.681
Mr. Governor,

1753
01:09:53.705 --> 01:09:54.583
these northern groups,

1754
01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:55.584
the Student Nonviolent

1755
01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.151
Coordinating Committee and

1756
01:09:57.175 --> 01:09:58.920
the Congress on Racial Equality,

1757
01:09:58.944 --> 01:10:00.588
they're bussing people in from

1758
01:10:00.612 --> 01:10:01.689
all over the country,

1759
01:10:01.713 --> 01:10:03.591
New York, Washington, Detroit.

1760
01:10:03.615 --> 01:10:04.592
On the other hand, I got

1761
01:10:04.616 --> 01:10:05.860
the Klan readying for war.

1762
01:10:05.884 --> 01:10:07.262
They're bringing people

1763
01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:08.162
in from all over the state.

1764
01:10:08.186 --> 01:10:09.030
Judge Christenberry

1765
01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:09.899
has ordered you and

1766
01:10:09.923 --> 01:10:10.900
the Bogalusa police

1767
01:10:10.924 --> 01:10:12.233
to protect the protestors.

1768
01:10:12.257 --> 01:10:13.135
You're goin' against

1769
01:10:13.159 --> 01:10:14.769
a federal decree, Mr. Mayor!

1770
01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:15.970
I understand that, sir.

1771
01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:17.605
I've got coloreds here

1772
01:10:17.629 --> 01:10:19.807
with automatic rifles, pistols.

1773
01:10:19.831 --> 01:10:21.609
We even have some reports

1774
01:10:21.633 --> 01:10:23.077
they have hand grenades.

1775
01:10:50.762 --> 01:10:51.973
Riots broke out in downtown

1776
01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:53.741
Bogalusa in reactions

1777
01:10:53.765 --> 01:10:54.742
to the shooting of two

1778
01:10:54.766 --> 01:10:56.644
Negro law enforcement officers.

1779
01:10:56.668 --> 01:10:58.046
One officer was killed

1780
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.948
and the other

1781
01:10:58.972 --> 01:11:00.181
was critically injured.

1782
01:11:00.205 --> 01:11:01.215
Negro protestors

1783
01:11:01.239 --> 01:11:02.150
were repelled by...

1784
01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:03.017
President Johnson's

1785
01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:03.886
pissed off.

1786
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:04.887
He wants this to end.

1787
01:11:04.911 --> 01:11:06.988
Didn't you tell me that God

1788
01:11:07.012 --> 01:11:08.122
is gonna help the people

1789
01:11:08.146 --> 01:11:09.324
of Bogalusa?

1790
01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:10.292
Just get your ass

1791
01:11:10.316 --> 01:11:12.417
down there and end it now.

1792
01:11:38.043 --> 01:11:39.387
Who are you?

1793
01:11:39.411 --> 01:11:41.155
I'm Alan Garrison.

1794
01:11:41.179 --> 01:11:42.156
I'm a lawyer for

1795
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.125
the Department of Justice.

1796
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:45.960
Come on.

1797
01:11:45.984 --> 01:11:47.161
Our position is we need

1798
01:11:47.185 --> 01:11:48.663
to end the violence now

1799
01:11:48.687 --> 01:11:50.098
before somebody's killed.

1800
01:11:50.122 --> 01:11:51.733
That ain't gonna happen.

1801
01:11:51.757 --> 01:11:52.834
We got children marching.

1802
01:11:52.858 --> 01:11:53.702
You want me to just

1803
01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.103
leave 'em to be shot or clubbed?

1804
01:11:55.127 --> 01:11:56.804
No. I've already put together

1805
01:11:56.828 --> 01:11:57.972
a case against the police,

1806
01:11:57.996 --> 01:11:59.674
Chief Neely and

1807
01:11:59.698 --> 01:12:01.142
his deputies, that I'm bringing

1808
01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:02.777
to the Federal Court.

1809
01:12:02.801 --> 01:12:04.012
Thank you.

1810
01:12:04.036 --> 01:12:05.346
I'm gonna force them to protect

1811
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:06.314
the protestors so you

1812
01:12:06.338 --> 01:12:07.418
and your men don't have to.

1813
01:12:08.073 --> 01:12:08.917
Marcus, please.

1814
01:12:08.941 --> 01:12:12.053
Listen.

1815
01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:13.721
I know Mayor Martinson has

1816
01:12:13.745 --> 01:12:14.722
already set up a meeting for you

1817
01:12:14.746 --> 01:12:15.457
and him to sit down

1818
01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:17.191
with the governor.

1819
01:12:17.215 --> 01:12:19.127
Are you gonna go to that?

1820
01:12:19.151 --> 01:12:20.461
Start working this out?

1821
01:12:20.485 --> 01:12:26.768
I'm thinking about it.

1822
01:12:26.792 --> 01:12:28.970
You want me to stop the protest?

1823
01:12:28.994 --> 01:12:30.471
I wouldn't, if I were you.

1824
01:12:30.495 --> 01:12:32.440
The name of the game

1825
01:12:32.464 --> 01:12:33.307
is to make as much noise

1826
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:34.175
as you can for as long

1827
01:12:34.199 --> 01:12:35.143
as you can.

1828
01:12:35.167 --> 01:12:36.044
Eventually, the cavalry

1829
01:12:36.068 --> 01:12:36.979
will come in.

1830
01:12:37.003 --> 01:12:38.346
Oh, so you're

1831
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:39.380
the cavalry now?

1832
01:12:39.404 --> 01:12:40.715
I thought the cavalry

1833
01:12:40.739 --> 01:12:41.383
was supposed to show up

1834
01:12:41.407 --> 01:12:42.750
before they lynched the people.

1835
01:12:42.774 --> 01:12:43.951
We got cemeteries filled

1836
01:12:43.975 --> 01:12:45.319
with people waiting for y'all!

1837
01:12:45.343 --> 01:12:46.354
Marcus...

1838
01:12:46.378 --> 01:12:48.156
I ain't waiting

1839
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:51.049
for the cavalry.

1840
01:12:57.022 --> 01:12:57.866
Set up the meeting,

1841
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:59.024
Mr. Garrison.

1842
01:13:01.426 --> 01:13:03.438
You don't want no pie?

1843
01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:05.073
Yeah.

1844
01:13:05.097 --> 01:13:06.507
All right, boys.

1845
01:13:06.531 --> 01:13:07.742
Y'all made your point.

1846
01:13:07.766 --> 01:13:08.510
So let me tell you

1847
01:13:08.534 --> 01:13:09.777
what we're proposing.

1848
01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:10.446
You tell me, Mr. Governor,

1849
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:11.979
if I'm misspeaking.

1850
01:13:12.003 --> 01:13:13.448
The prudent cause would be

1851
01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:14.749
to hear your demands,

1852
01:13:14.773 --> 01:13:15.451
talk about them

1853
01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:17.118
if there was a truce.

1854
01:13:17.142 --> 01:13:18.386
Let everybody cool down,

1855
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:20.888
stop protesting, stop boycotting

1856
01:13:20.912 --> 01:13:22.890
white businesses

1857
01:13:22.914 --> 01:13:24.325
and then we start to talk.

1858
01:13:24.349 --> 01:13:25.326
Excuse me.

1859
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:27.261
You brought us down here to say

1860
01:13:27.285 --> 01:13:30.865
stop and we can have a talk?

1861
01:13:30.889 --> 01:13:32.400
We're already talking right now!

1862
01:13:32.424 --> 01:13:34.235
Let's discuss it right now.

1863
01:13:34.259 --> 01:13:35.369
Thank you.

1864
01:13:35.393 --> 01:13:37.171
I brought you down here,

1865
01:13:37.195 --> 01:13:38.206
you and the mayor,

1866
01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:39.540
so we could end the violence.

1867
01:13:39.564 --> 01:13:42.076
Let's get down to brass tacks.

1868
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.377
What do you boys

1869
01:13:43.401 --> 01:13:44.879
personally want?

1870
01:13:44.903 --> 01:13:46.314
And how can we help you?

1871
01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:48.116
How can you help us?

1872
01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.784
Okay, Mr. Governor,

1873
01:13:49.808 --> 01:13:50.818
let me make this real

1874
01:13:50.842 --> 01:13:51.986
simple for you.

1875
01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.855
Desegregate the public spaces.

1876
01:13:53.879 --> 01:13:56.858
Desegregate the city jobs.

1877
01:13:56.882 --> 01:13:58.860
That's our starting point.

1878
01:13:58.884 --> 01:14:00.194
Anything less is

1879
01:14:00.218 --> 01:14:01.262
unacceptable, period.

1880
01:14:01.286 --> 01:14:02.130
And as head of

1881
01:14:02.154 --> 01:14:02.997
the Voters League,

1882
01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:03.865
I can guarantee you

1883
01:14:03.889 --> 01:14:04.532
that the boycotts

1884
01:14:04.556 --> 01:14:05.400
and the protests

1885
01:14:05.424 --> 01:14:07.235
will continue if our demands

1886
01:14:07.259 --> 01:14:08.336
are not met.

1887
01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.203
We will listen

1888
01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:10.172
to your demands.

1889
01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:11.205
Now I can't promise anything.

1890
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:12.874
Those are sweeping changes.

1891
01:14:12.898 --> 01:14:13.908
That happen

1892
01:14:13.932 --> 01:14:15.176
to be federal law.

1893
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.978
Our city is coming into line

1894
01:14:17.002 --> 01:14:18.546
with federal civil rights laws,

1895
01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:20.281
but right now, 
I'm asking you

1896
01:14:20.305 --> 01:14:21.949
to take the first step.

1897
01:14:21.973 --> 01:14:23.518
Stop protesting,

1898
01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:26.020
stop boycotting.

1899
01:14:26.044 --> 01:14:28.222
When I urinate, it comes out

1900
01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:29.924
bloody 'cause of the damage

1901
01:14:29.948 --> 01:14:30.893
done to my kidneys

1902
01:14:30.917 --> 01:14:32.126
from a beating I took

1903
01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:33.961
from your police department.

1904
01:14:33.985 --> 01:14:35.563
So don't you dare ask me

1905
01:14:35.587 --> 01:14:37.231
to take the first step!

1906
01:14:37.255 --> 01:14:39.333
Well, I am sorry

1907
01:14:39.357 --> 01:14:40.568
about that, Marcus.

1908
01:14:40.592 --> 01:14:43.204
But I am demanding you

1909
01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:46.574
end protests, end boycotts.

1910
01:14:46.598 --> 01:14:47.909
You can't demand

1911
01:14:47.933 --> 01:14:48.910
a damn thing.

1912
01:14:48.934 --> 01:14:50.077
All you guarantee me

1913
01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:51.279
is more talking.

1914
01:14:51.303 --> 01:14:53.014
That's what I'm asking you

1915
01:14:53.038 --> 01:14:54.348
to take back to your people

1916
01:14:54.372 --> 01:14:56.083
'cause I hear you may not

1917
01:14:56.107 --> 01:14:57.318
even be the president of

1918
01:14:57.342 --> 01:15:01.155
the Voters League by Saturday.

1919
01:15:01.179 --> 01:15:02.623
Go to hell.

1920
01:15:02.647 --> 01:15:05.459
Let's go.

1921
01:15:05.483 --> 01:15:07.094
What is most important

1922
01:15:07.118 --> 01:15:08.429
is we need the so-called

1923
01:15:08.453 --> 01:15:10.031
Deacons for Defense

1924
01:15:10.055 --> 01:15:11.432
to disarm and no longer

1925
01:15:11.456 --> 01:15:12.867
maintain patrols!

1926
01:15:12.891 --> 01:15:15.636
Excuse me?

1927
01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:18.339
What are you talking about?

1928
01:15:18.363 --> 01:15:20.508
Deacons for Defense?

1929
01:15:20.532 --> 01:15:21.509
What is that?

1930
01:15:21.533 --> 01:15:23.578
A church group?

1931
01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.379
You heard of it, T. J.?

1932
01:15:25.403 --> 01:15:26.614
Don't know nothing about it.

1933
01:15:26.638 --> 01:15:27.615
You, Archie?

1934
01:15:27.639 --> 01:15:28.883
Not me.

1935
01:15:28.907 --> 01:15:31.385
We ain't heard of 'em.

1936
01:15:31.409 --> 01:15:35.890
I'll tell you if I find 'em.

1937
01:15:35.914 --> 01:15:38.459
You take care of yourself.

1938
01:15:38.483 --> 01:15:40.218
Tea?

1939
01:15:51.263 --> 01:15:55.276
Go on, do it!

1940
01:16:47.719 --> 01:16:50.131
Brooks, what you doin'

1941
01:16:50.155 --> 01:16:51.332
in the dark? Come over here.

1942
01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:53.525
Come on.

1943
01:16:57.362 --> 01:16:59.507
How'd you get so beautiful?

1944
01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:00.708
Aw, Daddy.

1945
01:17:00.732 --> 01:17:02.243
No, I mean it.

1946
01:17:02.267 --> 01:17:03.444
How did you get to be

1947
01:17:03.468 --> 01:17:05.513
so beautiful?

1948
01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:10.284
From you.

1949
01:17:10.308 --> 01:17:12.620
You still scared?

1950
01:17:12.644 --> 01:17:16.223
One day, I promise you,

1951
01:17:16.247 --> 01:17:18.059
you're not gonna feel

1952
01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:21.162
that way no more.

1953
01:17:21.186 --> 01:17:23.788
It's gonna be all right.

1954
01:17:28.626 --> 01:17:30.795
It's gonna be all right.

1955
01:17:44.642 --> 01:17:46.520
Y'all wanna see me?

1956
01:17:46.544 --> 01:17:47.621
Yes.

1957
01:17:47.645 --> 01:17:49.423
Come, Marcus.

1958
01:17:49.447 --> 01:17:50.392
Come on in.

1959
01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.259
Come sit with us.

1960
01:17:52.283 --> 01:17:56.364
Now the congregation put

1961
01:17:56.388 --> 01:17:58.332
together some boxes of food

1962
01:17:58.356 --> 01:17:59.333
for you and your family

1963
01:17:59.357 --> 01:18:00.701
and we also raised

1964
01:18:00.725 --> 01:18:02.503
a collection here.

1965
01:18:02.527 --> 01:18:03.738
No, I can't.

1966
01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:04.772
You gotta provide

1967
01:18:04.796 --> 01:18:06.207
for your family.

1968
01:18:06.231 --> 01:18:11.812
Marcus, please?

1969
01:18:11.836 --> 01:18:13.772
Thank you.

1970
01:18:14.839 --> 01:18:16.717
You look tired, Marcus.

1971
01:18:16.741 --> 01:18:19.687
I am tired.

1972
01:18:19.711 --> 01:18:20.788
Maybe you should

1973
01:18:20.812 --> 01:18:23.057
stay home tonight.

1974
01:18:23.081 --> 01:18:25.192
Stay in tonight, Marcus.

1975
01:18:25.216 --> 01:18:27.228
We got it covered.

1976
01:18:27.252 --> 01:18:29.797
Marcus, maybe you should step

1977
01:18:29.821 --> 01:18:31.665
down from the Voters League.

1978
01:18:31.689 --> 01:18:33.267
What are you talking about?

1979
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.102
What are you talking about?

1980
01:18:35.126 --> 01:18:35.836
Nothing personal.

1981
01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.704
We ain't even

1982
01:18:36.728 --> 01:18:37.571
gonna discuss that.

1983
01:18:37.595 --> 01:18:38.472
Nothin' was achieved

1984
01:18:38.496 --> 01:18:39.373
with the governor.

1985
01:18:39.397 --> 01:18:40.241
After the blood

1986
01:18:40.265 --> 01:18:41.209
that has been spilled,

1987
01:18:41.233 --> 01:18:42.210
after the tears from

1988
01:18:42.234 --> 01:18:43.744
marching every day,

1989
01:18:43.768 --> 01:18:45.279
we are no further along.

1990
01:18:45.303 --> 01:18:46.580
Marcus has given his life

1991
01:18:46.604 --> 01:18:47.681
to this!

1992
01:18:47.705 --> 01:18:49.116
This can't go on forever!

1993
01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:49.784
Of course, it can!

1994
01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:50.652
What are you talking about?

1995
01:18:50.676 --> 01:18:51.652
Please!

1996
01:18:51.676 --> 01:18:52.620
Listen.

1997
01:18:52.644 --> 01:18:53.488
I been in touch with

1998
01:18:53.512 --> 01:18:54.555
Dr. King's folks.

1999
01:18:54.579 --> 01:18:55.524
I asked them to send

2000
01:18:55.548 --> 01:18:57.258
somebody down here to help us.

2001
01:18:57.282 --> 01:18:58.226
What'd they say?

2002
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:00.661
Well, because of their stance

2003
01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:02.430
on nonviolence, they said they

2004
01:19:02.454 --> 01:19:04.465
cannot afford to be associated

2005
01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:07.101
with us because of the Deacons.

2006
01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:09.303
We're on our own down here.

2007
01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:11.272
It's because of Marcus that

2008
01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:12.606
we can't get whatever we need.

2009
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:13.542
You shut up!

2010
01:19:13.566 --> 01:19:16.143
Please, please, please!

2011
01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:19.580
I have been living in fear

2012
01:19:19.604 --> 01:19:23.317
of the Klan all my life.

2013
01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:26.587
It was bred in me as a child

2014
01:19:26.611 --> 01:19:28.856
and it made me less than a man.

2015
01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.526
But all of that has changed

2016
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:34.695
because of you.

2017
01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:36.664
You freed me, son.

2018
01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:39.867
You woke up something in me,

2019
01:19:39.891 --> 01:19:42.603
so don't you stop.

2020
01:19:42.627 --> 01:19:44.805
Don't you dare stop.

2021
01:19:44.829 --> 01:19:47.274
And tomorrow, I'm gonna be

2022
01:19:47.298 --> 01:19:48.776
marching with you

2023
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.678
and I'm gonna march every day

2024
01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.813
to change what's happening

2025
01:19:52.837 --> 01:19:54.148
down here.

2026
01:19:54.172 --> 01:19:54.850
And there ain't gonna be

2027
01:19:54.874 --> 01:19:56.617
no change in leadership.

2028
01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:59.153
Ain't gonna be no stepping down.

2029
01:19:59.177 --> 01:20:01.689
Marcus is still in charge.

2030
01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:03.657
That's right.

2031
01:20:03.681 --> 01:20:05.359
Amen.

2032
01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:08.796
Now, you men, let's get

2033
01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:09.864
these groceries over

2034
01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:11.365
to Marcus's house.

2035
01:20:11.389 --> 01:20:12.600
Be careful out there.

2036
01:20:12.624 --> 01:20:17.595
Marcus, God bless you, my son.

2037
01:20:21.566 --> 01:20:23.210
Keep the faith, Marcus,

2038
01:20:23.234 --> 01:20:25.603
keep the faith.

2039
01:20:37.815 --> 01:20:40.251
Never again.

2040
01:21:20.858 --> 01:21:21.703
I hear you're

2041
01:21:21.727 --> 01:21:23.304
winning everybody over.

2042
01:21:23.328 --> 01:21:24.405
Where's your buddy?

2043
01:21:24.429 --> 01:21:25.606
He's down at the office.

2044
01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:26.840
We're both back.

2045
01:21:26.864 --> 01:21:27.975
You gonna go back

2046
01:21:27.999 --> 01:21:30.778
and join the protest?

2047
01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:32.780
Well, how you doing, Michael?

2048
01:21:32.804 --> 01:21:34.515
Oh, not too bad, Marcus.

2049
01:21:34.539 --> 01:21:35.549
Thanks for asking.

2050
01:21:35.573 --> 01:21:36.584
They knocked out five teeth

2051
01:21:36.608 --> 01:21:37.552
in the back of my mouth,

2052
01:21:37.576 --> 01:21:39.320
fractured a couple of bones.

2053
01:21:39.344 --> 01:21:40.621
Good news is, the doctor

2054
01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:41.655
says that the bleeding

2055
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:42.756
in my liver has stopped.

2056
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.791
Oh, that's real good, Michael.

2057
01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:44.693
Glad to see you back up

2058
01:21:44.717 --> 01:21:46.026
on your feet.

2059
01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:48.295
You wanna be my friend now.

2060
01:21:48.319 --> 01:21:51.332
Why don't you get on the floor?

2061
01:21:51.356 --> 01:21:52.366
I'll go outside and see if I can

2062
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:53.467
find me some good old boys to

2063
01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:54.768
kick you around a little bit.

2064
01:21:54.792 --> 01:21:55.670
I'll tell 'em you don't

2065
01:21:55.694 --> 01:21:56.837
like to defend yourself.

2066
01:21:56.861 --> 01:21:57.706
They'll be lined up

2067
01:21:57.730 --> 01:21:58.730
all around the corner.

2068
01:22:00.064 --> 01:22:02.543
You ready for a real good

2069
01:22:02.567 --> 01:22:04.011
ass-whipping?

2070
01:22:06.371 --> 01:22:07.414
Yeah.

2071
01:22:07.438 --> 01:22:08.283
I am ready for a real good

2072
01:22:08.307 --> 01:22:09.316
ass-whipping.

2073
01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:09.985
But, no, I do not wanna

2074
01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.051
be your friend.

2075
01:22:11.075 --> 01:22:11.953
I just thought maybe you might

2076
01:22:11.977 --> 01:22:13.053
look at me differently once

2077
01:22:13.077 --> 01:22:14.455
I had my face cracked open.

2078
01:22:14.479 --> 01:22:15.489
But, fuck it, you wanna

2079
01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:16.657
hate me 'cause I'm white?

2080
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:17.725
Or you wanna not trust me

2081
01:22:17.749 --> 01:22:19.893
'cause I'm...

2082
01:22:19.917 --> 01:22:21.462
Whatever, Marcus? I don't care.

2083
01:22:21.486 --> 01:22:23.063
But I'm gonna be here and

2084
01:22:23.087 --> 01:22:26.333
I am gonna be here fighting.

2085
01:22:26.357 --> 01:22:30.838
All right, then.

2086
01:22:30.862 --> 01:22:33.941
You wanna come over to my house,

2087
01:22:33.965 --> 01:22:37.378
get something to eat?

2088
01:22:37.402 --> 01:22:40.347
No. I really don't.

2089
01:22:40.371 --> 01:22:41.715
Okay.

2090
01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:42.583
Just a little respect

2091
01:22:42.607 --> 01:22:43.485
for my effort.

2092
01:22:43.509 --> 01:22:45.986
That's all I really want.

2093
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:47.321
Federal officer.

2094
01:22:47.345 --> 01:22:47.988
Go ahead.

2095
01:22:48.012 --> 01:22:48.856
Just the two men

2096
01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.758
I wanted to speak to.

2097
01:22:49.782 --> 01:22:51.759
I didn't know you two

2098
01:22:51.783 --> 01:22:52.783
were friends.

2099
01:22:53.651 --> 01:22:54.496
What's going on?

2100
01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.562
I brought a suit

2101
01:22:55.586 --> 01:22:56.464
in Federal Court against

2102
01:22:56.488 --> 01:22:57.631
the Bogalusa police

2103
01:22:57.655 --> 01:22:59.433
and the Washington Parish

2104
01:22:59.457 --> 01:23:00.367
police.

2105
01:23:00.391 --> 01:23:01.069
We go Monday.

2106
01:23:01.093 --> 01:23:02.336
I'd like you both to be there.

2107
01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.504
Definitely.

2108
01:23:03.528 --> 01:23:05.005
Good.

2109
01:23:05.029 --> 01:23:07.374
Marcus?

2110
01:23:07.398 --> 01:23:12.513
If my friend goes, I go.

2111
01:23:12.537 --> 01:23:15.573
Okay.

2112
01:23:21.145 --> 01:23:24.382
What are y'all fixing to eat?

2113
01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:29.431
Lester?

2114
01:23:29.455 --> 01:23:30.764
Yes, Mr. Mayor?

2115
01:23:30.788 --> 01:23:32.433
Cease and desist.

2116
01:23:32.457 --> 01:23:33.500
But...

2117
01:23:33.524 --> 01:23:35.869
In reference to Marcus Clay,

2118
01:23:35.893 --> 01:23:38.138
any orders you've been given,

2119
01:23:38.162 --> 01:23:39.873
cease and desist.

2120
01:23:39.897 --> 01:23:41.709
The governor does not want

2121
01:23:41.733 --> 01:23:43.410
any more tension put here.

2122
01:23:43.434 --> 01:23:46.080
You understand?

2123
01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:49.450
I said do you understand me?

2124
01:23:49.474 --> 01:23:51.985
Yes, sir.

2125
01:23:52.009 --> 01:23:53.845
Good.

2126
01:24:04.422 --> 01:24:05.532
This is a list of

2127
01:24:05.556 --> 01:24:06.834
Ku Klux Klan members?

2128
01:24:06.858 --> 01:24:07.702
That's the list that I

2129
01:24:07.726 --> 01:24:09.770
and other federal agents

2130
01:24:09.794 --> 01:24:12.539
collected from our observations

2131
01:24:12.563 --> 01:24:14.675
of the Ku Klux Klan activities.

2132
01:24:14.699 --> 01:24:16.677
And this is a list of

2133
01:24:16.701 --> 01:24:18.612
the local Bogalusa police.

2134
01:24:18.636 --> 01:24:20.147
You'll see that several members

2135
01:24:20.171 --> 01:24:22.149
of the police department are

2136
01:24:22.173 --> 01:24:23.884
members of the Ku Klux Klan.

2137
01:24:23.908 --> 01:24:26.053
Captain Joseph Lawson, one of

2138
01:24:26.077 --> 01:24:29.690
the defendants, is among them.

2139
01:24:29.714 --> 01:24:30.558
Let's look at

2140
01:24:30.582 --> 01:24:31.716
this movie you took.

2141
01:24:49.901 --> 01:24:51.578
Now I see photos and film

2142
01:24:51.602 --> 01:24:52.946
in Bogalusa and all I see

2143
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:54.214
are Confederate flags.

2144
01:24:54.238 --> 01:24:55.916
Is there not one American flag

2145
01:24:55.940 --> 01:25:00.144
in the town of Bogalusa?

2146
01:25:12.924 --> 01:25:14.635
I see the police doing

2147
01:25:14.659 --> 01:25:19.072
nothing to protect those people.

2148
01:25:19.096 --> 01:25:21.708
Turn it off!

2149
01:25:21.732 --> 01:25:24.211
I gave the order once in July

2150
01:25:24.235 --> 01:25:26.547
and now here I am again.

2151
01:25:26.571 --> 01:25:28.916
I am making this court decree

2152
01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.484
for the last time.

2153
01:25:30.508 --> 01:25:33.821
You stop beating and harassing

2154
01:25:33.845 --> 01:25:35.722
and arresting

2155
01:25:35.746 --> 01:25:39.026
and clubbing these people!

2156
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:41.228
You protect them!

2157
01:25:41.252 --> 01:25:43.697
And you ensure their

2158
01:25:43.721 --> 01:25:45.999
constitutional right to protest.

2159
01:25:46.023 --> 01:25:47.167
The instant you do not,

2160
01:25:47.191 --> 01:25:48.202
you'll be in violation

2161
01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:49.103
of my decree and

2162
01:25:49.127 --> 01:25:50.637
you will be jailed.

2163
01:25:50.661 --> 01:25:53.006
Is that clear?

2164
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:55.008
Also, these known Klan members,

2165
01:25:55.032 --> 01:25:57.911
William Chase and Lester Conley,

2166
01:25:57.935 --> 01:25:59.246
I'm issuing a declaration

2167
01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:00.547
stating that these men

2168
01:26:00.571 --> 01:26:02.549
cannot be within 100 yards

2169
01:26:02.573 --> 01:26:04.751
of a demonstration.

2170
01:26:04.775 --> 01:26:06.653
I will end this.

2171
01:26:06.677 --> 01:26:09.089
We're adjourned.

2172
01:26:09.113 --> 01:26:11.158
Marcus!

2173
01:26:11.182 --> 01:26:13.026
Gentlemen, we won!

2174
01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:14.661
At least acknowledge that.

2175
01:26:14.685 --> 01:26:16.029
Victories are few and far

2176
01:26:16.053 --> 01:26:17.164
between in this fight.

2177
01:26:17.188 --> 01:26:18.031
He made the same ruling

2178
01:26:18.055 --> 01:26:18.899
a couple of months ago.

2179
01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:19.867
Didn't mean anything then.

2180
01:26:19.891 --> 01:26:20.734
Do you think the police

2181
01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:21.602
listen to the federal

2182
01:26:21.626 --> 01:26:22.302
government, Mr. Garrison?

2183
01:26:22.326 --> 01:26:23.237
You know who the police

2184
01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:24.204
listen to in Louisiana?

2185
01:26:24.228 --> 01:26:25.138
Who?

2186
01:26:25.162 --> 01:26:26.006
The Klan.

2187
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.874
Do you know what the Klan is,

2188
01:26:26.898 --> 01:26:27.741
Mr. Garrison?

2189
01:26:27.765 --> 01:26:28.609
Because for me, coming from up

2190
01:26:28.633 --> 01:26:29.544
north, this has been one

2191
01:26:29.568 --> 01:26:30.677
eye-opening experience.

2192
01:26:30.701 --> 01:26:31.812
I know what the Klan is.

2193
01:26:31.836 --> 01:26:32.813
I don't think you do.

2194
01:26:32.837 --> 01:26:33.714
The Klan is

2195
01:26:33.738 --> 01:26:34.649
not beer-drinking rednecks

2196
01:26:34.673 --> 01:26:35.716
with sheets on their heads.

2197
01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:36.884
The Klan is an incredibly

2198
01:26:36.908 --> 01:26:38.118
violent paramilitary fascist

2199
01:26:38.142 --> 01:26:39.186
organization that dictates

2200
01:26:39.210 --> 01:26:40.187
to the police,

2201
01:26:40.211 --> 01:26:41.122
the local government,

2202
01:26:41.146 --> 01:26:42.155
the school boards.

2203
01:26:42.179 --> 01:26:43.156
It's more murderous, pervasive

2204
01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.291
and influential than any

2205
01:26:44.315 --> 01:26:45.259
criminal organization

2206
01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:46.127
in the United States,

2207
01:26:46.151 --> 01:26:47.327
including the mafia.

2208
01:26:47.351 --> 01:26:48.595
And the only reason that Hoover

2209
01:26:48.619 --> 01:26:49.897
and the rest of the world is not

2210
01:26:49.921 --> 01:26:50.998
up in arms about it is because

2211
01:26:51.022 --> 01:26:52.232
their victims are black.

2212
01:26:52.256 --> 01:26:53.700
The only reason you're here

2213
01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:54.701
is because somebody in the

2214
01:26:54.725 --> 01:26:55.769
government didn't like seeing

2215
01:26:55.793 --> 01:26:57.170
little black children being beat

2216
01:26:57.194 --> 01:26:58.572
up on the news every night.

2217
01:26:58.596 --> 01:27:00.040
You think I'm the enemy here?

2218
01:27:00.064 --> 01:27:01.842
I risked my life

2219
01:27:01.866 --> 01:27:02.809
coming down here.

2220
01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:03.677
Mr. Garrison,

2221
01:27:03.701 --> 01:27:04.579
I appreciate that.

2222
01:27:04.603 --> 01:27:06.013
But the truth is, you're never

2223
01:27:06.037 --> 01:27:08.282
gonna get hard white southern

2224
01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:09.883
boys to protect Negroes.

2225
01:27:09.907 --> 01:27:11.051
Don't underestimate me,

2226
01:27:11.075 --> 01:27:12.152
Mr. Clay.

2227
01:27:12.176 --> 01:27:13.153
See, if you're wrong,

2228
01:27:13.177 --> 01:27:14.055
you're gonna go back

2229
01:27:14.079 --> 01:27:15.088
to court and fight another day.

2230
01:27:15.112 --> 01:27:16.323
Gonna get another decree.

2231
01:27:16.347 --> 01:27:18.659
But for me, it means somebody

2232
01:27:18.683 --> 01:27:20.093
I know or love gets

2233
01:27:20.117 --> 01:27:21.361
a bullet in their head.

2234
01:27:21.385 --> 01:27:23.230
This decree is right,

2235
01:27:23.254 --> 01:27:24.598
Mr. Garrison, but we all know

2236
01:27:24.622 --> 01:27:25.799
that that decree

2237
01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:26.867
is gonna be tested.

2238
01:27:26.891 --> 01:27:29.736
And when it is, the Deacons,

2239
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.863
the Deacons, will be there.

2240
01:27:39.804 --> 01:27:41.348
Over the past months, riots

2241
01:27:41.372 --> 01:27:42.749
have broken out in protest

2242
01:27:42.773 --> 01:27:44.251
to Judge Herbert Christenberry's

2243
01:27:44.275 --> 01:27:45.285
court ruling.

2244
01:27:45.309 --> 01:27:46.987
School integration is being

2245
01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:47.988
strongly challenged

2246
01:27:48.012 --> 01:27:49.189
by the Klan and

2247
01:27:49.213 --> 01:27:51.124
other local white-only groups.

2248
01:27:51.148 --> 01:27:53.293
A Klan spokesman has stated

2249
01:27:53.317 --> 01:27:54.695
that this is a crucial test

2250
01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:56.330
of local and states rights.

2251
01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:57.631
Parish and local police

2252
01:27:57.655 --> 01:27:58.699
departments have been reluctant

2253
01:27:58.723 --> 01:28:00.300
to enforce the court's decree.

2254
01:28:00.324 --> 01:28:02.202
In Bogalusa, local Klan leaders

2255
01:28:02.226 --> 01:28:03.337
have declared that they

2256
01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:04.671
will make a final stand

2257
01:28:04.695 --> 01:28:05.406
and test the

2258
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:06.407
Christenberry ruling

2259
01:28:06.431 --> 01:28:07.674
by resisting the integration

2260
01:28:07.698 --> 01:28:08.976
of Bogalusa High.

2261
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.077
The Deacons for Defense have

2262
01:28:10.101 --> 01:28:11.244
vowed to defend

2263
01:28:11.268 --> 01:28:12.312
the black students' right

2264
01:28:12.336 --> 01:28:15.439
to integrate at all costs.

2265
01:28:24.015 --> 01:28:27.351
All right, fellas, it's on.

2266
01:28:32.089 --> 01:28:33.700
Lucille?

2267
01:28:33.724 --> 01:28:35.669
Lucille, you remember

2268
01:28:35.693 --> 01:28:36.737
what I told you?

2269
01:28:36.761 --> 01:28:37.405
Yes.

2270
01:28:37.429 --> 01:28:38.438
Go to it.

2271
01:28:38.462 --> 01:28:39.706
Okay, everybody, let's go!

2272
01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:40.374
All right, y'all.

2273
01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:41.275
Get to your cars!

2274
01:28:41.299 --> 01:28:42.342
Hurry!

2275
01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:49.116
Get this bunch of animals!

2276
01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:51.084
Everybody get outta here!

2277
01:28:51.108 --> 01:28:51.986
Move, move!

2278
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:53.820
This bunch of niggers!

2279
01:28:53.844 --> 01:28:55.822
Keep going, keep going.

2280
01:28:55.846 --> 01:28:56.990
They shouldn't be around us,

2281
01:28:57.014 --> 01:28:58.125
you understand?

2282
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:59.326
Ready for a test?

2283
01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:00.228
Take them down the back.

2284
01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:03.230
Get 'em outta here!

2285
01:29:03.254 --> 01:29:04.264
Get on the bus!

2286
01:29:04.288 --> 01:29:05.198
Daddy, I'm not

2287
01:29:05.222 --> 01:29:06.066
gonna get on...

2288
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:06.934
Get on the bus.

2289
01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:08.068
I'm not leaving.

2290
01:29:08.092 --> 01:29:09.369
Go on inside!

2291
01:29:09.393 --> 01:29:10.237
Go on inside!

2292
01:29:10.261 --> 01:29:11.105
You stay there!

2293
01:29:11.129 --> 01:29:12.406
Don't you come outta there!

2294
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:13.473
They shouldn't be here.

2295
01:29:13.497 --> 01:29:16.209
They're a bunch of niggers!

2296
01:29:16.233 --> 01:29:17.744
Don't fire unless

2297
01:29:17.768 --> 01:29:18.446
you're fired upon.

2298
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:20.013
I don't like this.

2299
01:29:20.037 --> 01:29:20.982
Are you ready?

2300
01:29:21.006 --> 01:29:22.082
Yes, sir!

2301
01:29:29.747 --> 01:29:30.791
I'm ordering you to put

2302
01:29:30.815 --> 01:29:32.392
your weapons down right now!

2303
01:29:32.416 --> 01:29:33.326
We ain't putting down

2304
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:34.227
a damn thing unless

2305
01:29:34.251 --> 01:29:35.096
you get them the

2306
01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.163
hell outta here!

2307
01:29:36.187 --> 01:29:37.898
Disarm your men right now

2308
01:29:37.922 --> 01:29:39.866
or I will confiscate these guns!

2309
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:41.068
I'd rather die before

2310
01:29:41.092 --> 01:29:42.069
somebody takes this gun

2311
01:29:42.093 --> 01:29:43.103
outta my hands.

2312
01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.404
You are under a federal order

2313
01:29:44.428 --> 01:29:45.939
to protect these people.

2314
01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:47.374
They hit us, they beat us,

2315
01:29:47.398 --> 01:29:48.842
and all we do is lift up our

2316
01:29:48.866 --> 01:29:49.843
guns and defend ourselves,

2317
01:29:49.867 --> 01:29:50.944
and you go crazy.

2318
01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:52.379
If you do not protect these

2319
01:29:52.403 --> 01:29:53.447
people, you will be arrested,

2320
01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:54.314
sir.

2321
01:29:54.338 --> 01:29:55.183
You get the fuck

2322
01:29:55.207 --> 01:29:56.850
outta my face, boy!

2323
01:29:56.874 --> 01:29:58.051
All right.

2324
01:29:58.075 --> 01:29:59.286
Charlie, I want you to go

2325
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:00.153
to the school.

2326
01:30:00.177 --> 01:30:01.021
I want you to find a phone

2327
01:30:01.045 --> 01:30:01.888
and call the Eastern District

2328
01:30:01.912 --> 01:30:02.756
Federal Courthouse

2329
01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.423
in Baton Rouge.

2330
01:30:03.447 --> 01:30:04.325
All right.

2331
01:30:04.349 --> 01:30:05.425
Wait, wait!

2332
01:30:05.449 --> 01:30:06.793
Marcus, be reasonable.

2333
01:30:06.817 --> 01:30:07.495
We know each other

2334
01:30:07.519 --> 01:30:08.962
a long time.

2335
01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:10.163
Order your men

2336
01:30:10.187 --> 01:30:11.465
to put their guns down.

2337
01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:13.800
Why don't you get their guns?

2338
01:30:13.824 --> 01:30:15.469
It's time to take a stand!

2339
01:30:15.493 --> 01:30:17.003
It's them or us!

2340
01:30:17.027 --> 01:30:18.939
I'm talking to you.

2341
01:30:18.963 --> 01:30:21.842
All right, then.

2342
01:30:21.866 --> 01:30:23.410
I'll put my gun down.

2343
01:30:23.434 --> 01:30:24.911
Christenberry said you

2344
01:30:24.935 --> 01:30:25.979
were gonna defend my life.

2345
01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:27.247
He said you're gonna defend

2346
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:30.383
all these peoples' lives.

2347
01:30:30.407 --> 01:30:37.023
It's time to end this.

2348
01:30:37.047 --> 01:30:38.225
Are you ready?

2349
01:30:38.249 --> 01:30:40.460
Yes, sir!

2350
01:30:42.553 --> 01:30:43.830
Let's do it!

2351
01:30:43.854 --> 01:30:45.256
We're ready!

2352
01:30:49.393 --> 01:30:52.105
Archie, if they kill me,

2353
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:55.075
you know what to do.

2354
01:30:55.099 --> 01:30:56.243
I gotcha.

2355
01:30:56.267 --> 01:30:57.878
The only thing stopping

2356
01:30:57.902 --> 01:30:58.979
a man from greatness

2357
01:30:59.003 --> 01:31:03.340
is the fear of his own death.

2358
01:31:10.047 --> 01:31:11.591
I made the call.

2359
01:31:11.615 --> 01:31:13.326
Did you hear that?

2360
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:14.828
You're about to be arrested,

2361
01:31:14.852 --> 01:31:18.022
sheriff.

2362
01:31:20.491 --> 01:31:22.335
I guarantee you that,

2363
01:31:22.359 --> 01:31:24.237
no matter what happens to me,

2364
01:31:24.261 --> 01:31:25.505
there'll be more white blood

2365
01:31:25.529 --> 01:31:27.574
than Negro blood running

2366
01:31:27.598 --> 01:31:28.608
in the streets today.

2367
01:31:28.632 --> 01:31:30.310
And that includes your blood

2368
01:31:30.334 --> 01:31:32.345
'cause you will be dead.

2369
01:31:32.369 --> 01:31:33.346
That's the only thing you

2370
01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:34.481
understand, isn't it?

2371
01:31:34.505 --> 01:31:37.284
Aim!

2372
01:31:37.308 --> 01:31:39.019
Goddamn it!

2373
01:31:39.043 --> 01:31:42.122
I am gonna send you

2374
01:31:42.146 --> 01:31:45.258
to your maker!

2375
01:31:45.282 --> 01:31:46.626
Goddamn it, Chase!

2376
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:47.961
Put your gun down!

2377
01:31:47.985 --> 01:31:49.930
I am not afraid and I am

2378
01:31:49.954 --> 01:31:53.066
no less of a man than you are.

2379
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:54.501
Put the gun down, Chase!

2380
01:31:54.525 --> 01:31:55.936
I will not.

2381
01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.637
I said put

2382
01:31:56.661 --> 01:31:58.238
the goddamned gun down!

2383
01:31:58.262 --> 01:31:59.372
Go to hell, Neely.

2384
01:31:59.396 --> 01:32:00.373
I'm ordering you

2385
01:32:00.397 --> 01:32:02.542
to put that gun down.

2386
01:32:02.566 --> 01:32:03.477
It's over.

2387
01:32:03.501 --> 01:32:04.544
Under federal mandate,

2388
01:32:04.568 --> 01:32:06.179
these people have the right

2389
01:32:06.203 --> 01:32:08.081
to assemble and I have

2390
01:32:08.105 --> 01:32:09.883
the obligation to guarantee

2391
01:32:09.907 --> 01:32:11.418
their safety.

2392
01:32:11.442 --> 01:32:14.387
You are under arrest.

2393
01:32:14.411 --> 01:32:15.422
Traitor!

2394
01:32:15.446 --> 01:32:17.424
You Judas!

2395
01:32:17.448 --> 01:32:19.292
You're a disgrace

2396
01:32:19.316 --> 01:32:20.594
to your white race!

2397
01:32:20.618 --> 01:32:22.963
Cuff him and take him away.

2398
01:32:22.987 --> 01:32:24.197
Don't think this

2399
01:32:24.221 --> 01:32:25.932
is over yet, Marcus.

2400
01:32:25.956 --> 01:32:29.903
You know why men wear hoods?

2401
01:32:29.927 --> 01:32:34.507
'Cause they got no courage.

2402
01:32:34.531 --> 01:32:36.076
You all put down your

2403
01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.510
weapons or you'll be arrested

2404
01:32:37.534 --> 01:32:40.180
for violating a federal law!

2405
01:32:40.204 --> 01:32:41.314
And I mean it!

2406
01:32:41.338 --> 01:32:42.682
We will arrest anybody

2407
01:32:42.706 --> 01:32:46.019
who does not move out.

2408
01:32:46.043 --> 01:32:48.088
Move out!

2409
01:32:48.112 --> 01:32:52.225
Guns down!

2410
01:32:52.249 --> 01:32:54.118
Let's go.

2411
01:33:00.557 --> 01:33:04.061
Yeah!

2412
01:33:05.262 --> 01:33:07.140

Deacons for Defense!

2415
01:33:09.233 --> 01:33:10.443
Deacons for Defense!

2416
01:33:10.467 --> 01:33:11.511
Never again!

2417
01:33:11.535 --> 01:33:12.512
Never again!

2418
01:33:12.536 --> 01:33:13.447
Never again!

2419
01:33:13.471 --> 01:33:17.050
Never again!

2420
01:33:17.074 --> 01:33:18.418
I hope they drive him

2421
01:33:18.442 --> 01:33:20.086
straight to hell.

2422
01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:22.255
You see that coward

2423
01:33:22.279 --> 01:33:23.957
driving away in that car?

2424
01:33:23.981 --> 01:33:25.058
He's goin' to jail.

2425
01:33:25.082 --> 01:33:25.960
You're partly responsible

2426
01:33:25.984 --> 01:33:28.561
for that.

2427
01:33:28.585 --> 01:33:29.996
I want you to remember.

2428
01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.431
I don't want you ever

2429
01:33:31.455 --> 01:33:35.559
to forget it.

2430

Deacons for Defense!

2431
01:33:44.034 --> 01:33:45.278
Deacons for Defense!

2432
01:33:45.302 --> 01:33:47.771
All right, fellows!

2433
01:33:59.616 --> 01:34:00.727
Gonna be interesting

2434
01:34:00.751 --> 01:34:01.995
to see what happens with

2435
01:34:02.019 --> 01:34:03.763
this integration thing.

2436
01:34:03.787 --> 01:34:05.465
Your order will be

2437
01:34:05.489 --> 01:34:07.200
ready tomorrow.

2438
01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:10.327
See you then.

2439
01:34:12.529 --> 01:34:15.141
May I help you?

2440
01:34:15.165 --> 01:34:17.043
No, thank you.

2441
01:34:17.067 --> 01:34:20.513
I'll call you if I need you.

2442
01:34:20.537 --> 01:34:22.649
Okay.

2443
01:34:22.673 --> 01:34:24.050
What do you think?

2444
01:34:24.074 --> 01:34:26.610
It's nice.

2445
01:34:38.622 --> 01:34:40.233
So your summer vacation's

2446
01:34:40.257 --> 01:34:41.334
over?

2447
01:34:41.358 --> 01:34:43.436
You sure you don't wanna

2448
01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.404
come over to my house?

2449
01:34:44.428 --> 01:34:45.305
Have some dinner like

2450
01:34:45.329 --> 01:34:46.206
we talked about in church?

2451
01:34:46.230 --> 01:34:47.140
I can't.

2452
01:34:47.164 --> 01:34:48.041
There's still a couple of

2453
01:34:48.065 --> 01:34:48.708
rednecks down the road

2454
01:34:48.732 --> 01:34:49.577
who haven't had a chance

2455
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:54.748
to whup my ass yet.

2456
01:34:54.772 --> 01:34:56.816
A lot of people could have died.

2457
01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.652
I'll never subscribe

2458
01:34:59.676 --> 01:35:00.687
to what you do.

2459
01:35:00.711 --> 01:35:01.589
You know, I killed

2460
01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:03.289
white men in Germany.

2461
01:35:03.313 --> 01:35:04.591
People said they was evil,

2462
01:35:04.615 --> 01:35:06.059
so that was all right.

2463
01:35:06.083 --> 01:35:07.494
Now I defend myself against

2464
01:35:07.518 --> 01:35:08.762
pretty much the same kind of man

2465
01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:10.196
and you want me to feel

2466
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.165
like I'm not

2467
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:12.232
as honorable as you,

2468
01:35:12.256 --> 01:35:13.233
that I should feel ashamed

2469
01:35:13.257 --> 01:35:14.534
for protecting my family.

2470
01:35:14.558 --> 01:35:16.836
No.

2471
01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:18.271
No, that's not true.

2472
01:35:18.295 --> 01:35:20.173
I don't want you to feel

2473
01:35:20.197 --> 01:35:21.608
ashamed of a damn thing.

2474
01:35:21.632 --> 01:35:24.477
Truth is, only reason anyone

2475
01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:25.678
listens to us at all is 'cause

2476
01:35:25.702 --> 01:35:26.580
they're too afraid

2477
01:35:26.604 --> 01:35:29.549
to deal with you.

2478
01:35:29.573 --> 01:35:30.683
Thought I was gonna have

2479
01:35:30.707 --> 01:35:31.785
to give a gun to my son and

2480
01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.186
tell him to go on and make

2481
01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:35.088
your way in the world.

2482
01:35:35.112 --> 01:35:37.157
That's not what I want for him.

2483
01:35:37.181 --> 01:35:38.491
You might have made it

2484
01:35:38.515 --> 01:35:40.260
so he doesn't have to.

2485
01:35:40.284 --> 01:35:44.164
Been a long, long fight.

2486
01:35:44.188 --> 01:35:47.100
I'm with you.

2487
01:35:47.124 --> 01:35:48.592
I know that.

2488
01:35:52.463 --> 01:35:53.440
You take real good care

2489
01:35:53.464 --> 01:35:55.466
of yourself.

2490
01:35:57.468 --> 01:35:59.512
Archie, take care of him.

2491
01:35:59.536 --> 01:36:00.647
I will.

2492
01:36:00.671 --> 01:36:01.781
Hillibrand.

2493
01:36:01.805 --> 01:36:03.740
Goodbye, Marcus.

2494
01:36:29.399 --> 01:36:30.543
Let me hear it!

2495
01:36:30.567 --> 01:36:31.644
Yes, sir!

2496
01:36:31.668 --> 01:36:32.613
Never again!

2497
01:36:32.637 --> 01:36:33.746
Never again!

2498
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:34.914

2499
01:36:34.938 --> 01:36:36.883
