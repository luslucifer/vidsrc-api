00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.490
"Almighty..
- O blessed being of the Lord.."


51
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.410
Don't you have a home?

52
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.170
Why are you wandering about?
- What do I do, then?


53
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.090
Don't you stay put and sing songs?

54
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.490
You roam about and sing.

55
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.890
Similarly, I follow you
to hear your songs.


56
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.650
Won't you continue singing?
- What's in it for me?


57
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.170
Aren't you a poor man?
- Look who's talking!


58
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.170
I may be poor but not my heart.

59
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.490
When I sing, people reward me
with anything they like.


60
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.650
What will you give?
- Me?


61
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.610
Take this.
Go ahead.. Take it.


62
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.690
This is food, some dessert.

63
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.850
This is lavish food.

64
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.170
Will I be able to stomach it?

65
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.170
Mom says that regardless
of what food it is


66
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.130
one should feel blessed to be
able to have it. - She's right.


67
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.250
Absolutely right.
Today, you gave me this.


68
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.850
Your entire life, you'll be
gifting this to everyone.


69
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.450
What! Will I only give
and not receive anything?


70
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.770
Not everyone descends
on the Earth to eat.


71
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.450
Some come here to make other's eat.

72
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.570
Your work will be to feed everyone.

73
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.690
Here it is.
- Take the coins.. The coins.


74
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.330
Tell us.. - What will you become?
- Here.. This way.


75
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.610
Mr. Kartik.

76
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.850
Mr. Kartik.
- What is it?


77
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.770
The fried prawns..
Please pass them to me.


78
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.370
I'll add them to this preparation
of banana flowers.


79
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.730
No way! You shouldn't add
non-vegetarian food to that.


80
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.650
Come on!
I'm only adding it to food.


81
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.450
Stop arguing with me
and pass me the prawns.


82
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.690
That isn't right.

83
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.290
No one adds prawns
to a preparation of banana flowers.


84
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.490
That's not the way.
- Really?


85
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.650
You're so naive, Mr. Kartik.

86
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.810
That kind of dish
won't work out. - It will.


87
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.290
It will happen from now on.
- What..


88
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.490
It's delicious!

89
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.770
Harishadhon. - Yes?
- Were the dishes prepared


90
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.050
for your grandson's ceremony
or a wedding?


91
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.250
Such delicious spreads!

92
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.130
Harishadhon.
- Tell me.


93
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.610
Please call your head chef.

94
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.810
I'd like to reward him with Re. 1.

95
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.130
Then he'll become a rich man.
- Yes.


96
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.930
I'll call him right away.

97
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.730
Kartik, come here.

98
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.490
Listen.

99
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.570
As the gentleman is happy and
content with the dishes you made


100
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.130
he'd like to offer you a reward.

101
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.010
Me?

102
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.330
Re. 1.

103
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.930
Take it.

104
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.930
It was nice meeting you.
- Goodbye, Harishadhon.


105
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.090
Goodbye.

106
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.770
Please come again.
- Of course.


107
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.170
You live off me

108
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.930
and you dare ask me for reasons!

109
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.450
What should I say?
Tell me!


110
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.930
Don't expect me to tell people
that like a girl, my nephew


111
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.770
spends time in the kitchen
and I'm proud of it!


112
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.210
Then why do people hire chefs
to make food?


113
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.890
That's because
they get paid for it.


114
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.530
That's their profession.
- I see. Wow!


115
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.330
So, working for money
makes a person respectable


116
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.770
but working for free,
a girl? - Hey!


117
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.090
Stop arguing.
- This is absurd. - Come.


118
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.290
Aunt, take him away.

119
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.770
You quarrel and fight
like a woman.


120
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.090
Splendid.
Great.


121
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.530
Fine, Brother.

122
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.730
If I'm supposed to be
nothing but a carefree lad


123
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:05.970
I've made up my mind, then.

124
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.930
Henceforth, I won't be cooking
for this family.


125
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.170
No..

126
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:11.890
I'm going to work
at a confectionery.


127
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.450
Not even our ancestors
did such a thing


128
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.130
and you dare say
you want to be a confectioner!


129
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.330
A confectioner!

130
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.170
But, Brother-in-law

131
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.930
he must engage in some profession.

132
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.770
Hey.. Did you see that,
Sister-in-law? Did you see that?


133
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.490
He has become this stubborn
because of you!


134
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.370
If you do engage
in that profession


135
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.290
I'll sever all my ties with you.

136
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.210
A confectioner..
I will


137
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.290
be a confectioner.

138
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.610
Henceforth, I have no relationship
whatsoever with you people.


139
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.690
You people mean nothing to me.

140
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.530
Is that so?
- Yes, it is.


141
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.170
Is that so?
- I told you.. Yes, it is!


142
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.090
That's great, Mom. Now,
you won't have to slog that much.


143
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.290
What are you so scared of?

144
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.130
Just because my father is no more

145
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.850
I'll have to listen
to everything the uncles say?


146
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.650
But I'm scared.

147
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.810
Why do you want to create tension
in the relationships?


148
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.650
You're a scaredy-cat, not me.

149
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.210
And, Mom, what have they
done for us till date?


150
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.170
Nothing.

151
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.490
They're aristocrats..
They sit and do nothing all day.


152
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.730
I don't need such relatives.

153
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.050
All I want is for you to engage
in a respectable profession.


154
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.690
What!
Profession?


155
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.970
Who's going to give me a job?

156
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.810
Why?
You said real arrogantly


157
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.090
that you're going to be
a confectioner.


158
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.770
Well, that was
in the heat of the moment.


159
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.170
Yes, I know that.

160
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.050
That's why I've asked Reba

161
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.850
to let me know
if there are any vacancies


162
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:48.970
in her husband's shop.
- Oh, wow..


163
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.850
She said just telling her husband
about it is going to suffice.


164
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.410
Really..
- Yes.


165
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.290
I-Is it
Mr. Kalidas Indra's confectionery?


166
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.970
The one in Baghbazar?
- Yes.


167
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.210
It's a renowned confectionery, Mom.

168
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.570
Mom, is it really him,
Mr. Kalidas Indra?


169
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.450
He's going to hire me!

170
00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.290
Some people tend to listen
to your scaredy-cat of a mother.


171
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.610
Mom!
You're the best!


172
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.130
Let me go..
Oh, God.. Let go..


173
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.610
I hope it's going to be nice
and sharp.


174
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.610
It's going to be real nice
and sharp.


175
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.410
You can chop people up with it,
not just fish.


176
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.330
Hey, Hari..
- Hey..


177
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.770
Yes, you should go..
- Want some fish..


178
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.570
I've got some fresh fish here..
Want some fish..


179
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.730
I can cook prawns
with banana flowers.


180
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.890
I can cook spicy patties
made of poppy seeds.


181
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.090
I can cook a variety of vegetables
and lentils.


182
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.730
Bottle gourd with dried..
- Did I ask you all that?


183
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.730
I can make other dishes
made of prawn..


184
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.490
I can make some mean chutney
made of coconut.


185
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.330
Spicy fish gumbo.. - Did I
ask you any of that? - What..


186
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.250
No.. - If you want to work here,
don't engage in idle chatter.


187
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.730
No..

188
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.690
When I'm not present here

189
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.010
you need to help out
with the sales. - Okay..


190
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.970
There's a book here.
It has a list of all the prices.


191
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.650
Take a good look at it
and memorise it.


192
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.610
You won't look for the book
in front of the customers. - Okay..


193
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.250
And if there are any discrepancies
in the accounts


194
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.410
I'll deduct the money
from your salary. - I-I..


195
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.690
Won't I be making
any confectionery?


196
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.570
Confectionery?

197
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.650
Can you make confectionery?
How old are you?


198
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.530
Y-Yes..
I'm 20..


199
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.890
Mahesh! Hemen!
- Coming!


200
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.890
Go show him the cooking area.

201
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.730
Come on, my boy.
Come.


202
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.570
Well, I was just saying..
If we drizzle it with some honey


203
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.890
and sprinkle some raisins on it,
it will taste smashing, right?


204
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.930
And if we add some cashews..
- Don't tell the boss that.


205
00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.730
He's going to slap you silly.
- What..


206
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.730
You can experiment all you like
when you open your own shop.


207
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.130
Rubbish.. - No.. I..
- Hold this!


208
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.650
Okay..
- Go!


209
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.850
Mr. Nobin.
- What..


210
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.730
No..
I-I was just leaving..


211
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.650
Don't tell other people
about what you want to do.


212
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.450
Otherwise, upon hearing it,
they'll go stark raving mad.


213
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.090
What are you saying? - Nothing.
What could I possibly say?


214
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.050
First, you need to demonstrate
how good you are at your work.


215
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.650
Then we'll see
if they still get mad at you.


216
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.210
All you do is yap all day.
- Hey!


217
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.690
Just do your job!
Rubbish..


218
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.610
Raisins..
- Yes?


219
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.930
The raisins are in a container
under that.


220
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.490
"O Lord Ram.."

221
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.890
"All hail Lord Ram.."

222
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.210
I'm content with this.

223
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.130
Hey..

224
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.690
Who are you?
- A thief.


225
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.850
A thief..
T-Thief.. - Hey..


226
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.250
Thief.. - No..
Hide-and-seek..


227
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.730
I'm playing hide-and-seek.
- Okay..


228
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.650
Have a look outside.
- What..


229
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.850
Look!
Look outside!


230
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.330
Did you see that chubby little boy?
- Yes..


231
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.170
He's the den. He's been looking
for me so that he can catch me.


232
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.730
Oh..
- Hey..


233
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.130
Hey..
Is he looking this way?


234
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:16.730
He's looking this way.

235
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.650
H
-He isn't headed this way, is he?

236
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.650
Since he's so chubby, it's not easy
for him to move about.


237
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:30.890
Great.

238
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.130
He left.
You can leave now.


239
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.490
You don't know him.
He's waiting outside patiently.


240
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.610
He'll catch me
the moment I leave. - Oh..


241
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.330
A person has been talking to you
all this while.


242
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.650
So, aren't you going to offer me
a glass of water?


243
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.610
This isn't my house. - A guest
is at par with God, right?


244
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.890
Bangles..

245
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.970
Come and get
some colourful bangles.


246
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.410
They're crafted beautifully..
- Why are you yapping?


247
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.570
They're..
- What.. It's nothing!


248
00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.930
What on earth are you doing?
- Nothing.


249
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.610
I'm just doing my job..
- You mind your own business!


250
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.970
Why are you after him?

251
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.010
Knick-knack seller..

252
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.730
Knick-knack seller..
- Everything fell down..


253
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.130
What's that dessert called?
- What!


254
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.290
What's that dessert called?
- 'Kheer Sandesh.'


255
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.610
Go on, give me one.

256
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.090
I added the raisin.

257
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.090
It's not that great.
- What..


258
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.130
It's not great?
- No. - Wait..


259
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.850
Yes..

260
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.250
T-Try this one.
- Okay.


261
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.850
This one is good.

262
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:50.770
No.

263
00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.330
No..

264
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.730
No.

265
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:13.850
No.

266
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.410
God..

267
00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.210
Who makes these desserts?

268
00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.530
You gobbled up

269
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.250
You didn't like a single one!

270
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.370
The craftsman isn't great.
He's still young.


271
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.450
Oh, dear.. No..
I don't make all this.


272
00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:31.850
Mr. Hemen has made all this.

273
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.050
He may be old
but he knows nothing about the art.


274
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.410
He couldn't learn the art till now?
- No.


275
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.850
Well, he's hopeless, then.

276
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.050
Why are you laughing?

277
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.250
Go on, look outside.
- What..


278
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.090
Look outside. Just check
if that chubby kid is still there.


279
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.650
Go on, look!
- Okay..


280
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.050
What a sweet girl..

281
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.890
Great.
The coast is clear.


282
00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.970
Take my word for it..
You needn't be worried.


283
00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.890
You can leave..

284
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.330
Hey..

285
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.490
Hey..
What's this.. Stop!


286
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.970
Oh, God! - Oh, dear..
- He rammed into me!


287
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.010
What the..

288
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:17.810
What are you all doing?

289
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.570
Was it a girl or a demoness?

290
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.250
She gobbled up not 1 or 2
but 16 pieces of sweets!


291
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.010
16!
- Yes..


292
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.770
He's new to this job
but what were you two doing?


293
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.490
What do we even say, sir?

294
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.410
T-That girl, right?
Short and stout?


295
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.650
Long locks.. Open..
- Y-Yes..


296
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.370
Yes, that's her.
S-She has a way with words.


297
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.650
Am I right?
- Yes..


298
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.650
Well, she's Bhola's granddaughter..
- Well..


299
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.850
Did I ask you
whose granddaughter she is?


300
00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.050
Did you make her pay for them?

301
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.530
Fine. Just think that you
treated her to it from your salary.


302
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.810
I'll deduct the money!
Got it?


303
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.690
Making people happy
is your job, right?


304
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.930
You're like a jester!

305
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.170
When it's time for Durga Puja

306
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.810
I'll lend you to the committee that
is in charge of the festivities.


307
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.330
You can dance, hop, skip and jump
to make people happy.


308
00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.370
Leave.
- Okay..


309
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.330
Leave!

310
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.370
Hey.. Quick..
- Hey, shut up, fatso!


311
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.170
Hey, stop..
Hey, girl!


312
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.010
Over here..
Come here, come on!


313
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.170
Dear, do you know where
Mr. Bhola lives? - I do!


314
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.770
In Shobha Bazar.

315
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.730
Okay..
- Shobha Bazar?


316
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.130
We were told
he lives in Baghbazar. - Yes..


317
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.210
I'm talking here!
You better be quiet!


318
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.610
He lives in the colony
adjacent to Shobha Bazar. - Yes..


319
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.290
Why are you going there?
For a cultural meet?


320
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.530
No..

321
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.690
It pertains to my son's
wedding proposal. - Yes..


322
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.410
Okay.. Wedding proposal..
- Wedding proposal..


323
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.490
He's meant to marry
Mr. Bhola's granddaughter.


324
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.530
Okay.. His granddaughter..
- His granddaughter.. - Yes!


325
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.410
Then you need to get there
before noon.


326
00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.610
Why, dear? - He tends to go
a bit crazy around noon.


327
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.490
He tends to mess things up.
- What!


328
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.930
Mess things up!
How, dear?


329
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.170
Only crazy people
bite others, right?


330
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.410
What! - Other people
have suffered the same fate.


331
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.370
What..

332
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.810
But his granddaughter is a doll.

333
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.090
Mom!

334
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.490
It's okay, go ahead, go there

335
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.570
but you need to return
before sundown.


336
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.610
Why, dear?
- When the sun goes down


337
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.850
he gets possessed by a spirit.
- M-Mom..


338
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.890
W-What..
- Yes, he does.


339
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.050
He gets possessed by a spirit
in the evening.


340
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.530
But it's not that big a deal.

341
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.690
He just goes to hunt for a tree
inhabited by spirits. - Mom!


342
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.810
But his granddaughter is a doll.
- Yes..


343
00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.170
You live here.

344
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.650
So, how do you know
about the things that happen there?


345
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.010
I'm not the only one.
Everyone knows about it.


346
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.290
Hey.. Tell them..
- What..


347
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.290
Yes.. - Yes..
- What..


348
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.930
Mom..
- Oh, shut up!


349
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.690
Don't be scared!
Turn the palanquin around..


350
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.130
Oh, God..
- Oh, God..


351
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.410
Oh, God..
- Quick!


352
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.490
Let's go.

353
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.610
Hey..
M-My money!


354
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.490
"Why"

355
00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.090
"do You not show up"

356
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.410
"though You said You would"

357
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.810
"O Lord Krishna?"

358
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.850
"Otherwise"

359
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:19.410
"the heart is not at peace."

360
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.850
"Why do You not show up though You
said You would, O Lord Krishna?"


361
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.250
"Otherwise, the heart
is not at peace."


362
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.610
"Why do You not show up though You
said You would, O Lord Krishna?"


363
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.010
"Otherwise, the heart
is not at peace."


364
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.250
"Only I know
what torture I have been through."


365
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.010
"The Lord is my only comfort."

366
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.970
"Only I know
what torture I have been through."


367
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.490
"The Lord is my only comfort."

368
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.330
"Days go by..
- Days go by.."


369
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.890
"Days go by
as I make this difficult journey."


370
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.370
"Days go by.."

371
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.930
"The melodious sound of the flute
is nowhere to be heard."


372
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:05.090
"The melodious sound of the flute
is nowhere to be heard."


373
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:09.410
"Flowers fall from trees
in gardens and forests.."


374
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.650
"He does not show up
though I await Him."


375
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.090
"All hail Radha.."

376
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.250
"All hail Radha.."

377
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.810
"All hail Radha.."

378
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.010
"All hail Radha.."

379
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.410
"All hail Radha.."

380
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.330
"All hail Radha.."

381
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.050
"I have laid the trap
of platonic love to capture You."


382
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.170
"Forget the world and come to me,
O Butter Thief."


383
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.770
"I have laid the trap
of platonic love to capture You."


384
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.010
"Forget the world and come to me,
O Butter Thief."


385
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.890
"I have laid the trap
under the 'Kadamba' tree"


386
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.450
"so that I can get
a glimpse of You."


387
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.690
"Forget the world and come to me,
O Butter Thief."


388
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.130
"I have laid the trap
of platonic love to capture You."


389
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.250
"Forget the world and come to me,
O Butter Thief.."


390
00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.290
"All hail Hari.."

391
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.410
"All hail Hari.."

392
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.610
"All hail Hari.."

393
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.530
"All hail Hari.."

394
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.450
"All hail Hari.."

395
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.250
"All hail Hari.."

396
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.250
"All hail Hari.."

397
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:29.890
"All hail Hari.."

398
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:40.450
Hey.. Stop..
Where had you been? Tell me!


399
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.210
Why are you running?

400
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.010
You horrid girl!

401
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.450
You're 15 years old
yet you have no prudence!


402
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.530
Your would-be in-laws
will be coming to see you today!


403
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.810
And what on earth are you doing?

404
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.490
Oh, God! Look..
Look, she's younger than you


405
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.410
but she's a married woman.
But you won't get married.


406
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.810
Let's go, come on!
Let's go home! - Hey..


407
00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.090
M
-My money..

408
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.810
You.. - Hey!
Who are you, boy?


409
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.930
I
-I'm Nobin Chandra Das.

410
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.770
I work at Mr. Kalidas Indra's shop.

411
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.370
That's great, but what am I
supposed to do about it?


412
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.410
S-She gobbled up 16 pieces
of sweets.. - Hey! - Hey, stop!


413
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.930
She gobbled up 16 pieces of sweets!

414
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.010
She didn't pay, did she?
Am I right?


415
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:15.930
Wait..

416
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.250
Just come with me..
I'll teach you a lesson today.


417
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.250
Dear, how much do we owe you?
- 4 annas, ma'am.


418
00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.210
Here you go, dear.

419
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.330
Here you go.

420
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.090
Hey! Come with me.
I'll teach you a lesson today.


421
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.250
Just wait..
Let's go. Let's go!


422
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.890
"You are the source
of River Yamuna."


423
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.730
"You make River Yamuna flow."

424
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.370
"I sit under the tree,
near the banks"


425
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.090
"tired and exhausted."

426
00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.370
"You are the source
of River Yamuna."


427
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.210
"You make River Yamuna flow."

428
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.610
"River Yamuna.."

429
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.810
Do you people sing and dance here
every day?


430
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.650
Why? Do you sing?
- No..


431
00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.130
Not really..
I can play the drums. - Splendid.


432
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.130
Is that so?

433
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.050
Then join us sometime.

434
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.490
You can play the drums with me.

435
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.890
B-But I work in a shop. So,
I don't really get any free time.


436
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.370
But if I do get some free time,
I'll definitely come here.


437
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:16.010
Do come.
I'll wait for you.


438
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.010
"River Yamuna.."

439
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.810
What are you,
a thief or a marauder?


440
00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.130
I'm not a thief.
- So, I'm a thief?


441
00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.130
You dare swindle my mother!
Give me the money back!


442
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.570
No.. No! - Give it back..
- No.. Don't..


443
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:38.610
Oh, God!

444
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.290
Good Lord..

445
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.930
I've got it.. You told
those travellers the truth.


446
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.050
Hey, spare me the lecture!

447
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.090
You dare come to take money
for those terrible sweets!


448
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.450
Terrible sweets? No wonder you
gobbled up 16 pieces of sweets!


449
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.650
I was hoping to taste
some good desserts.


450
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.370
Look..
Hey, look.


451
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.410
I'm not taking your money.

452
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.490
First, you need to treat me
to some good dessert.


453
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.530
Then I'll return you your money.

454
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.730
So, what qualifies
as a good dessert for you?


455
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.970
Good dessert..

456
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.330
It shouldn't be sticky.

457
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.370
And it shouldn't be dry
and flaky either.


458
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.810
It should be like the full moon.

459
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.330
It should be juicy
and super soft and squishy!


460
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.530
The moment you have it,
you should forget all your woes.


461
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.130
Thieves and saints alike..
Everyone should say..


462
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.610
That such a sweet doesn't exist
in the whole of India.


463
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.050
Mr. Nobin, that's the kind
of dessert I want.


464
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.730
You have a way with words..
- Yes.


465
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.890
And I can even behead someone
for giving me terrible sweets.


466
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.450
Wait..
Yes..


467
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.250
It shouldn't be sticky..
It should be soft.. - Yes.


468
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.690
Like the full moon..
- Yes! A dumpling soaked in syrup.


469
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.210
Such a sweet doesn't exist
in the whole of India.


470
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.370
Can you give me such a dessert?
- Don't forget to pay me, okay?


471
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.210
You'll get such a dessert.

472
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.330
It will be done..

473
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.210
It will be done..

474
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.330
It will be done!

475
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.130
Will it be done?
It will be done.


476
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.690
It should be like the full moon.
So, white and round..


477
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.730
So, what could I use?
Cottage cheese.. No, I must do it..


478
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.090
So, listen.. I'm thinking
of inventing a dessert.


479
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.050
Hey, listen..
- Just like this.. - Hey..


480
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.530
Give me some..
- A dumpling soaked in syrup.


481
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.930
Why not try making it yellow
in colour? - Oh, come on.


482
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.210
No way.
It will be round and white.


483
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.330
Ambitious..
- Hey.. - Make some Kachoris.


484
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.610
Round and white..
- What..


485
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.930
Like the full moon?
- No, not 'chand' or the moon.


486
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:51.770
'Chhana' or cottage cheese.
Hey, listen.


487
00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.690
Tomorrow morning,
I'm going to be needing


488
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.370
extra cottage cheese and sugar.

489
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.730
I'll give you all the ingredients.

490
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.490
Give me some munchies.
- Fine, go ahead, eat.


491
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:02.970
Roly-poly.

492
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.170
Greetings.

493
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.850
Goodness..
- Greetings..


494
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.850
Hey.. - Please, Mr. Mahesh,
let me think.


495
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:12.610
I just can't get it right..

496
00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.530
Oh, come on!
If you keep talking..


497
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.370
What's going on?

498
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.010
I-I..
I-I'm..


499
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.210
I-I'm.. - What are you?
- I-I'm..


500
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.850
What? An idiot?
- No..


501
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.330
I'm trying to make a new dessert.

502
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.530
It's made only of cottage cheese.

503
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.050
It's soft and squishy.. And juicy..
- Only cottage cheese?


504
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.450
If I add dried whole milk to it,
it won't be soft and squishy.


505
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.530
So, I thought I'll use..
- How did you know that?


506
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.650
I know. That's why..
- You know?


507
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.290
You know all that
but you don't know


508
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.370
that the sweet won't absorb
the syrup if it isn't fried!


509
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.250
If I fry it,
it won't be white anymore.


510
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.210
That's why I thought..
- So, you know more than me?


511
00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.810
You know more than Bhim Nag?
- Sir..


512
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.610
No..
- Bhim Nag fried his sweets!


513
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.290
That's how he could make
a special sweet for Lady Canning!


514
00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.610
If he hadn't fried the dough,
the way you don't want to


515
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.170
Lady Canning wouldn't have got that
special dessert named after her!


516
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.530
I was just trying to do it
in a novel manner.. - New! Novel!


517
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.490
You think you can conquer the
world of desserts at the age of 20!


518
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:07.610
You dare become so ambitious!

519
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.370
There's no such thing
as a new dessert!


520
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.850
You need to do
what everyone else is doing!


521
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.210
He wants to make dessert..
- But everyone in Bengal


522
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.130
is doing something new,
something novel.


523
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.610
And I can't experiment
with desserts..


524
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.370
You dare ruin a batch of sweets
and argue with me!


525
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.650
And if you keep at it,
I'll kick you out of the shop!


526
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.130
Mahesh!

527
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.450
The Duttas from Bowbazar
have ordered some special sweets


528
00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:34.450
on account of '
Jamai Shashti'.

529
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.410
Make sure no one taints
my reputation that day.


530
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:06.770
Oh, God..

531
00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:15.570
Who is it..

532
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.090
The Ganges is a nice and wide river

533
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.850
but you didn't find a-anywhere else
to throw your guavas?


534
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:21.970
I didn't throw any guavas at you.

535
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.290
I saw you. So, I thought
of grabbing your attention.


536
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.570
Oh, God..
- Hey! Do you have no job?


537
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.450
'It will be done..'

538
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.690
A dumpling soaked in syrup!
Rubbish!


539
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.570
I told you.. It will be done.
You can take my word for it.


540
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.050
A dumpling soaked in syrup..

541
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.330
I won't rest until it's done.
- Of course!


542
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.690
He says he won't rest
until he makes it! - Oh, be quiet!


543
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.890
Why? Why should I be quiet?
You're a lazy bum.


544
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.650
People with a job, work.
They don't stare at the Ganges.


545
00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.770
Then what are you doing here?

546
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.490
As if you have a ton of work..

547
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.290
Go on.. Go find a tree
infested with spirits.


548
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.330
I'll teach you a lesson..
- You troublemaker! You imp!


549
00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:58.490
Oh, God..
Hey!


550
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:00.170
Rubbish..

551
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:05.490
Oh, God..
Stop throwing guavas at me..


552
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.210
Oh, God..
- Rubbish.. - Sorry.. Stop..


553
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:10.650
Oh, God..

554
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:12.730
Now, do you understand
how it feels? - Get lost!


555
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.130
Rubbish..

556
00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.210
Thank God..
Oh, God..


557
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.810
If you don't have sweet thoughts
and you don't utter sweet words


558
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.610
how will you be good
at making sweets?


559
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.930
Is this the way to talk to girls?

560
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.210
If a confectioner's behaviour
and words aren't nice


561
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.370
he can't make good sweets.
Do you understand?


562
00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.890
Look at him..
He's preaching to me about sweets.


563
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.330
Oh, Lord..

564
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.010
Hey!
Watch that tone of yours!


565
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.610
Do you know who made that
special dessert for Lady Canning?


566
00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:50.050
He did!
- Bhim Nag! - Yes!


567
00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.290
Who have you brought
with you, Rupa?


568
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.970
This confectioner is a child.
- Mahesh, the confectioner, said


569
00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:43.170
that he can make novel desserts
and sweets.


570
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:44.770
Please give me a chance.

571
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.410
I'll be able to do it, ma'am.
- Great.


572
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.610
Rupa, you can leave.
- Okay.


573
00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.850
I need to have a word with him
in private. - Okay.


574
00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.970
I won't be able to turn my neck
every time I have to talk to you.


575
00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.530
You need to come stand
in front of me. - What.. Okay.


576
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.330
I have three sons-in-law.

577
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.770
You need to make
a special dessert for them.


578
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.330
Will you be able to do it?

579
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.890
Don't nod your head arrogantly!
Listen to me first!


580
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.210
All three of my sons-in-law
are out of this world!


581
00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.850
The eldest one is an addict.

582
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.730
He lies wasted with his friends
all day long. - For shame..


583
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.490
Marijuana.. He doesn't even
listen to his father-in-law!


584
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.330
Do you understand?
Today is 'Shashti'.


585
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.170
So, I had to round up
all three of them today.


586
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.290
And the middle one..

587
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.290
He has almost turned British
because he rubs elbows with them.


588
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.370
He doesn't like Indian cuisine
anymore.


589
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.490
He only likes the food
prepared by British people.


590
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.770
And the youngest one..

591
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.770
He has his nose buried into
either books or newspapers.


592
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.290
He reads a few books
and starts preaching to people.


593
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.770
You have to enchant
all three of them.


594
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:56.370
Will you be able to do it?
- Enchant them! M-Me?


595
00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:01.810
No, ma'am.. A-Actually,
I-I'm not a very educated man.


596
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.010
My father died before I was born.

597
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.170
And my mother alone..
- Goodness! Listen, boy.


598
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.450
I didn't ask you to have
an intellectual battle with them.


599
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.370
Oh..
- You need to enchant them


600
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.890
by making a new dessert
and feeding it to them.


601
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.690
The dessert you make should be such
that no matter what happens


602
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.730
they shouldn't be able
to badmouth it.


603
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.090
Will you be able to do it?
- Yes..


604
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.330
It doesn't seem so.
- No.. I'll be able to do it..


605
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.250
Let me make something very clear..

606
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.450
I won't be able to give you
more than 1 anna per sweet


607
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.850
no matter what Mr. Kali
said to you.


608
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.290
Sugar..
Cottage cheese..


609
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.370
Dried whole milk..

610
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.610
I bet all these ingredients will
magically turn into a dessert.


611
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.490
What!
No.


612
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.650
Then go make it!
- Okay..


613
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.450
Nobin!
Did you make any dessert..


614
00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:10.890
Oh, God!

615
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.290
You haven't made anything yet!
What are you thinking?


616
00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.610
It has to go in..
- What!


617
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.850
This guy is crazy!

618
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.410
What the..
Goodness..


619
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.730
Ice apples always drench me
in their juices!


620
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.090
Hey! What happened?
- I got it.. - What..


621
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.410
I got it..
- What? - I got it!


622
00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.570
Listen, get me about 50 mangoes.
- What! Mangoes?


623
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.930
As many as you can get..
From anywhere you like..


624
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.650
Raw mangoes, ripe mangoes..
From the trees.. On the ground..


625
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.210
Get me everything you can find.
- Why? - Listen..


626
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:51.890
Chandu..

627
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.930
Do you see what I can see?
- Yes..


628
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.810
I can see a fruit,
not a piece of sweet.


629
00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.370
Same here.
- 'Aam Sandesh.'


630
00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.650
The dessert worth mentioning
is the one I had


631
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.570
at Mr. Maxwell's house.

632
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.370
It's evident

633
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.890
that this dessert was made
in an unhealthy manner.


634
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.530
It's not fit to be consumed.

635
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.610
I have written something
on this topic.


636
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.930
It was published in Uncle Amrit's..
- Oh, stop it.


637
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.450
Why mention academics
when we're having our meal?


638
00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.290
Listen, boy,
let me make something very clear..


639
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.050
If this dessert.. - Mom..
- ...turns out to be terrible


640
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.530
I'll suspend you from a rope

641
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.290
with a fire burning beneath you.
Got it?


642
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.770
No..
Why don't you all have one?


643
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.770
If you don't like it, I'll accept
any punishment you give me.


644
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:23.170
Go on, have it.

645
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.170
Go on, eat.

646
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.690
Hey..
What the..


647
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.130
You've got talent, boy.

648
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:42.610
Yes.

649
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.130
How old are you?
What's your name?


650
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.890
I'm 20 years old.
I'm Nobin.


651
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.610
Nobin!
- Yes.


652
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.490
You're a talented young thing.

653
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.890
You've just started
getting a moustache.


654
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:04.130
He's so very talented at such
a young age! - Yes.. - Nice..


655
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:08.010
He's a magician..
- You've made my mouth water!


656
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.410
Do you want to know what I think?

657
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.650
It's like Malkanjaan's gatherings.

658
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:18.010
No..
I won't let you go.


659
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.890
Come..

660
00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:25.130
Hey, dearest.. Taste this..
- I wish to give you my regards.


661
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.410
Come..

662
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.050
Hey.. Sir..
Oh, God..


663
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.090
Let him go..
- Oh, God.. My mom will scold me.


664
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.330
Goodness..
Sir..


665
00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.250
1 anna..
This dessert costs 1 anna!


666
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.450
Do you want my shop
to get closed down?


667
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.410
Do you do all this intentionally
or are you plain stupid?


668
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.090
Looks like you're getting used
to getting an applause. - No..


669
00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.290
The lady said..
- She said it


670
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.090
and you ran at full speed
to make such a lavish sweet!


671
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:54.850
Couldn't you tell her that this
sweet costs more than 1 anna?


672
00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.210
I
-I didn't calculate..

673
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.410
You're usually a motormouth.
You argue with your elders.


674
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.650
Go on!
Give him an answer!


675
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.890
What happened?
Cat got your tongue?


676
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.490
How are you going
to return the money?


677
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.170
We won't give you a single penny!

678
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.730
I ask for your forgiveness
on his behalf.


679
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.170
He misunderstood it.

680
00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:16.490
Please forgive him this time.

681
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.250
Please spare me, ma'am.

682
00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.410
I hired him
because Reba asked me to.


683
00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:22.610
I can't tolerate him any longer!

684
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.050
You expect me to lose my shop,
which has been running for years


685
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.090
just because
he wants to make something new?


686
00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.570
Well, I hope you now understand
who you've hired.


687
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.530
He's blighted, cursed!

688
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.530
He killed his father
even before he was born


689
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.330
and now, he's after your life!

690
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.330
You dare glare at us..
You dare glare at us!


691
00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.290
Can you do it? Will you be able
to return his money?


692
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.690
Are you capable of doing that?

693
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:45.970
What the..
- What the..


694
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:50.890
Mom..

695
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:05.530
Mom..

696
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:09.850
Give these to him.

697
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.410
Go on, take them.

698
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.890
You all have done me many favours.

699
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.690
Now, I don't need any help
from anyone.


700
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:22.730
Thank you.

701
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.970
Bless you.

702
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.210
You think you're so intelligent!

703
00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:36.090
So, you don't want any help, right?

704
00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.130
You need to leave this house
in seven days!


705
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.570
Seven days!
- Fine.


706
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:52.770
No, that's not possible.

707
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.650
All the people who work here
are old-school.


708
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.890
All the sweets are old-fashioned.

709
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.770
So, a new-age man like you
won't be able to do the work here.


710
00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.810
Come and get some curd..

711
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.370
Fresh curd..

712
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.530
Oh, the poor soul..
You're in misery..


713
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.490
You're having to do this work
at this age.


714
00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.130
What else can you possibly do
when you have a crazy son?


715
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.770
If you need money badly,
send him to our house.


716
00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.010
The garden needs to be tended to.
We'll give him some money.


717
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.090
The Lord has given you
a healthy son.


718
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.530
You need to put him to good use.
- I've heard


719
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.850
that Nobin is cleaning
the toilets of people now.


720
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:43.890
Good Lord!
It smells so bad!


721
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.410
Let's go.
- Let's go.


722
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.490
Did he use those dirty hands
to make sweets?


723
00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.330
Who knows..
Maybe.


724
00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:03.810
Disgusting.. The horrid smell..
It's nauseating..


725
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.130
Disgusting..
Let's go over there..


726
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.010
God..
The smell..


727
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.730
What else..
What else do you plan to do?


728
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:26.730
What else do you plan on doing?

729
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.410
You.. Kill me..
Kill me!


730
00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.530
Kill me! - Mom, what do I do?
What do I possibly do?


731
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.370
Mr. Indra has asked everyone
not to hire me.


732
00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.770
No one is giving me any work..

733
00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:41.650
In seven days, Mom..

734
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:43.810
If I don't arrange for the money,
where will we go..


735
00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:46.010
Where..
- We'll live on the streets..


736
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.930
We'll live in one corner
of the temple!


737
00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.210
You want to be a confectioner
and a confectioner you shall be!


738
00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.970
He who endures misery,
survives, my child.


739
00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.250
How much more
are we supposed to endure, Mom?


740
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:06.450
How much more
are we supposed to endure..


741
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.690
First, we need to survive!

742
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.250
Only then can I become
a confectioner.


743
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.290
When Lady Luck is kind to people
and it's sunny and pleasant


744
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.930
people are able to showcase
their courage, my child.


745
00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:27.930
But when..

746
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.050
When there are dark clouds
in the skies


747
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:34.570
and a storm is approaching

748
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.570
one must have faith, my child.

749
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:43.610
Have faith in yourself.

750
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.970
I have faith in you.

751
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.570
I have undying faith in you..

752
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:05.450
What the..

753
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.570
What's the matter?
What happened?


754
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.570
Why is there no strength
in your arms today?


755
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.570
I have no strength in my arms..

756
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:21.930
I can't make the sweet
that I want to..


757
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.330
None of you are listening to me.

758
00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.090
Ouch!

759
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.290
Rubbish!

760
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:03.610
Nobin..

761
00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:09.290
Greetings, Nobin!

762
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:11.210
Hey, Nobin!

763
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:14.690
What..

764
00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.330
You've been feasting your eyes but
what about earning a livelihood?


765
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.690
I mean..
There's no work.


766
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.250
I'll give you work.

767
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.330
Will you be my partner?
- What..


768
00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:34.610
Partner.
Business partner.


769
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:38.730
Okay..
- I have an unused shop.


770
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:42.290
Your culinary skills
and my business skills..


771
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.010
Do you agree to it?
- Yes!


772
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.930
Now, even I'll be working with you.

773
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:49.890
What are you saying, Mr. Mahesh!
- Yes..


774
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.530
Enough of working for that man.
- Well


775
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.930
this marks the beginning
of our partnership.


776
00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.250
Come..
Let me give you my regards.


777
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:01.890
Come..
- H-Hey.. - Hey..


778
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:03.530
Come.. - Hey..
What are you doing?


779
00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.770
Oh, Lord, let me go..

780
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.290
Look..

781
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:15.410
Bishnu, who are these people?

782
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:18.410
God.. He's done for..
He's so done for..


783
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.650
"Pitter-patter fall the raindrops"

784
00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:39.130
"on the body.."

785
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.770
"You are my only cloudy sky."

786
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:45.090
"The giver of lovely shade.."

787
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.050
"The giver of lovely shade.."

788
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:52.250
"There are countless colours
in the world."


789
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.890
"Your face reflects
the seven primary colours."


790
00:49:55.370 --> 00:50:00.570
"Lifelong happiness lies hidden
in your lovely face."


791
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.570
"Lifelong happiness.."

792
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:07.770
"When the flowers
fall on the ground"


793
00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.410
"the heart will sway."

794
00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.010
"You and I will live together
happily"


795
00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.730
"by taking
the seven vows of marriage."


796
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.210
"When the flowers
fall on the ground"


797
00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.930
"the heart will sway."

798
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:26.370
"You and I will live together
happily"


799
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.210
"by taking
the seven vows of marriage."


800
00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:32.730
"I will sing the same song for you"

801
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.130
"by having you seated before me."

802
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:38.850
"Pitter-patter fall the raindrops"

803
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.410
"on the body.."

804
00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.970
"You are my only cloudy sky."

805
00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.450
"The giver of lovely shade.."

806
00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:50.410
"The giver of lovely shade.."

807
00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:06.770
"How did this happen?"

808
00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.570
"Something of this nature
has never happened."


809
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:15.730
"As though a river has sprung
in the heart.."


810
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.250
"How did this happen?"

811
00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:21.970
"Something of this nature
has never happened."


812
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:28.250
"As though a river has sprung
in the heart.."


813
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:32.610
"I wish to say, O beloved.."

814
00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.890
"I wish to say, O beloved"

815
00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.570
"that my life is in your hands."

816
00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:44.250
"Pitter-patter fall the raindrops"

817
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.090
"on the body.."

818
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:50.490
"You are my only cloudy sky."

819
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.770
"The giver of lovely shade.."

820
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:55.810
"The giver of lovely shade.."

821
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:15.450
Oh, God!

822
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.810
What's the matter?
What on earth is the matter?


823
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:19.770
What.. - Why do you keep
peering and peeping?


824
00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:24.410
Hey.. No.. I-I..
Over there.. From there..


825
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.930
I just came here..
- Drop the act, Mr. Pretentious.


826
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.290
I've seen everything.

827
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.330
You've been following me
for a year now.


828
00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.410
No matter where I go,
you show up there.


829
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:35.010
You keep following me around
like a puppy.


830
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.370
What do you want?
What are your intentions?


831
00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:41.130
I'll be able to make
that special dessert.


832
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:45.130
But where will I find you?

833
00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:47.770
Do you see these ruins?

834
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.770
This is where I play hide-and-seek

835
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:52.450
and you keep following me
furtively.


836
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.130
No.. - Come here
and take my name loudly.


837
00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.050
I'll swoop down like a banshee
and appear before you. - Oh, God..


838
00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:00.170
Hey..

839
00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:06.530
What if I don't find you?

840
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:11.730
You will.

841
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:15.130
I will get my dessert,
which looks like the moon


842
00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:18.050
and you'll get your Khirod.

843
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:24.370
I'll get her?

844
00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:29.090
It will be so.

845
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:32.570
It will be so..

846
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.890
It will be so..
It will be so!


847
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:40.570
There's no need for you to worry.

848
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:43.730
A family function of yours is like
a family affair for us. - Yes.


849
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:45.610
We'll be shouldering
all the responsibilities. - Yes.


850
00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:08.410
Nobin!

851
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:12.170
I'm going to get some air.

852
00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:19.450
Take a look at this.
It fell apart again.


853
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.010
You won't be able to make
this kind of sweet, Nobin.


854
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.610
I..

855
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:31.890
Oh, my God!
What's that?


856
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.370
It's nothing..
Please continue..


857
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.610
Bishnu! Come give me
what I had asked for!


858
00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:42.050
Yes? - I was just saying..
Don't postpone this.


859
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:44.450
The girl is almost 16 years of age.

860
00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:46.610
If she gets any older,
she won't get married.


861
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:50.490
No, Mom, I won't get married.

862
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.810
I've given someone my word.
I'll have to make something.


863
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:56.050
I didn't ask you anything.

864
00:54:56.570 --> 00:54:58.250
You'll have to do
what I'm asking you to.


865
00:54:58.330 --> 00:54:59.650
You'll have to get married.
- What..


866
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.290
I took this decision
after deliberating over it.


867
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.250
This decision was reached after
giving it a lot of thought. Go on.


868
00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.090
They don't live in a joint family.

869
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:09.490
Listen, coming
to your unruly daughter


870
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.410
it's very difficult for her
to get along with several people.


871
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.250
But here, she'll have
only her husband and mother-in-law.


872
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.450
Goodness..
- It was nothing..


873
00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.210
They're living in a rented house.

874
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:24.650
You're into music
and playing the drums


875
00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.970
and their family
has always been into music.


876
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:29.370
He has set up his own shop.

877
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.090
You'll see..
Slowly, he'll do everything.


878
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:35.170
Besides, he's a confectioner
and so are you all.


879
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.730
Ma'am. - Yes?
- What's the groom's name?


880
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:40.570
Nobin Chandra Das!

881
00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:47.770
She's Mr. Bhola's granddaughter.

882
00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:02.810
"It is a blessed union
of two souls."


883
00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:06.010
"Have a look, my friend."

884
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:08.050
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

885
00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:12.090
"It is a blessed union
of two souls."


886
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:15.410
"Have a look, my friend."

887
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:17.450
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

888
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:21.650
"Upon getting Shyam"

889
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:24.810
"a wave of joy swept across Radha."

890
00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:27.770
"Upon getting Shyam"

891
00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:30.810
"a wave of joy swept across Radha."

892
00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.970
"Have a look, my friend."

893
00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:36.090
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

894
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:40.290
"It is a blessed union
of two souls."


895
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:43.290
"Have a look, my friend."

896
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.770
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

897
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:53.930
Hey!
You?


898
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.090
Hey..

899
00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:01.050
Hey, stop..
Hey.. Hey!


900
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:03.410
You've become very naughty.

901
00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:05.770
Bringing you to this house
was a wrong decision.


902
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:07.330
Come on, let's go outside.

903
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.890
Don't trouble me anymore.
I just got married. Go now.


904
00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:23.410
Goodness..
Please pass me the sugar.


905
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:25.450
What..
- Pass me the sugar. - Okay.


906
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.290
Open the lid.

907
00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:35.370
"It is a blessed union
of two souls."


908
00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:38.530
"Have a look, my friend."

909
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:40.650
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

910
00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:44.690
"It is a blessed union
of two souls."


911
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:47.890
"Have a look, my friend."

912
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.010
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

913
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:54.410
"Upon getting Shyam.."

914
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:55.810
You should try making these.
Then you'll know how tough it is.


915
00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:58.770
Even I'll have to do it?
- Why won't you?


916
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:02.290
I'm a confectioner and so are you.

917
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.410
"Have a look, my friend."

918
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:08.690
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

919
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:12.730
"It is a blessed union
of two souls."


920
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:15.930
"Have a look, my friend."

921
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.330
"Radha stood next to Shyam."

922
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:23.370
Good Lord..

923
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:32.730
What the heck is this?
- What the..


924
00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:35.770
Get up.. - What..
- Nobin. Nobin!


925
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:39.650
Nobin!
- Dumpling..


926
00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:41.890
Did you try to make that dessert
last night too?


927
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:44.210
You slept out here
with the new bride!


928
00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:45.850
You didn't even take her
to the room! - Goodness..


929
00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:49.450
You made her work all night,
right? - Don't tell me all that.


930
00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:51.770
I'm not interested in other
sleeping arrangements.. - No.


931
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:56.170
I didn't have any problem.
- Don't poke your nose into this.


932
00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:57.290
Don't encourage him.

933
00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:59.850
My love and my affection
have spoilt him!


934
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.610
Dear, listen to me very carefully.

935
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:03.570
You're a married man. You must
shoulder all the responsibilities.


936
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:05.170
I didn't even want to get married.
- What!


937
00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:08.250
My special dessert comes first.

938
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:10.010
Everything else is second to it.
- Of course!


939
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:11.210
He used to follow me around
all day


940
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:13.010
and now, he says
he didn't want to get married!


941
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:14.850
Liar!
- My son..


942
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:17.810
Did you used to follow her around?

943
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.530
No, Mom.
- How dare you say that!


944
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:21.010
Who are you making
this dessert for?


945
00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:23.450
So, you're making it for her?
- No, Mom!


946
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:24.730
Forget about that dessert.

947
00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:26.690
He can't make desserts.
He can only fool people.


948
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.930
And then he makes tall claims!
- What..


949
00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:30.330
I know what you're capable of.

950
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:32.970
You needn't make that dessert.
Just sit and do nothing! Okay?


951
00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:36.090
Is that so?
- Yes! - Fine.


952
00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:39.170
I won't enter the room
until I make that dessert!


953
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.370
I won't go anywhere near you!
- Dear..


954
00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:43.050
You imp! You dare lie..
- Nobin.. - You dare lie.


955
00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:47.130
What do I even say, sir?
Had I known.. - Hey!


956
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:49.970
...that you're the owner
of the shop.. - Hey..


957
00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:51.450
Hey, I'm the owner.

958
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:53.010
Then he.. - You think
we'll let you off the hook?


959
00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:54.650
No.. This is not done..
- What do you think of yourself?


960
00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:57.050
This is.. - I'll throw you
in jail! - Mr. Mahesh..


961
00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:59.810
What's going on? - Hey..
- Let's see who saves you!


962
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.090
What do I even say to you?

963
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.370
They're creating a ruckus
because of Mr. Chandu.


964
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.050
Where is he? - Listen,
I give you seven days.


965
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:09.810
If I don't get
the due rent by then

966
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.250
you'll get it from me!
You know, mister..


967
01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:14.210
I trusted them and rented out
the shop to them.


968
01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:16.090
They've been putting off
paying the rent


969
01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:17.450
for the last one and a half years.

970
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:20.890
You all are a band of cheats!
- No, sir. - Listen.


971
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:22.530
I paid you an advance
one month ago.


972
01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:24.810
Where's the new variety of sweet?

973
01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:26.890
Thank God I came to check
one day in advance.


974
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:30.570
Even the advance for the sweets
was taken by Mr. Chandu.


975
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.810
To hell with your Mr. Chandu!

976
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:35.090
The sweets are meant
for my son's wedding.


977
01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:37.210
My son won't get married again.

978
01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:40.330
No.. - If the sweets
don't get delivered on time


979
01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:44.130
I'll have your shop torn down
by goons!


980
01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.890
I promise you that.
- Yes, you should.


981
01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:49.050
Cheats!
They must be taught a lesson.


982
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:10.530
"Do not tease me, my love"

983
01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:14.370
"for I am young and naive."

984
01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:17.330
"Do not tease me, my love"

985
01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.210
"for I am young and naive."

986
01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:25.730
"I am young and naive."

987
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:29.170
"Do not tease me, my love."

988
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:36.370
"Let go.
Do not hold my hand."


989
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:39.730
"Do not tease me, my love"

990
01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:45.170
"for I am young and naive."

991
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.530
"Do not tease me, my love."

992
01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:55.370
"I wish my predicament"

993
01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:58.890
"could warn the others."

994
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:04.210
"May no other woman fall prey"

995
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.810
"to your deceptive ways."

996
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:10.730
"May no one be humiliated"

997
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:12.930
"the way"

998
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:17.250
"you have humiliated me."

999
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:21.370
"May no one lust after beauty"

1000
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:26.770
"ever again."

1001
01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:33.410
"Do pay heed to me, O beloved"

1002
01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:41.370
"for I am young and naive."

1003
01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:44.090
"Do not tease me, my love"

1004
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.850
"for I am young and naive."

1005
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:56.930
"Do not tease me, my love"

1006
01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:59.450
"for I am young and naive."

1007
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:05.290
"Do not tease me, my love"

1008
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:09.290
"for I am young and naive."

1009
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:13.090
"Do not tease me, my love.."

1010
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:16.170
"Do not tease me, my love.."

1011
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:21.770
Wonderful!
- Amazing! - Beautiful..


1012
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:24.570
Wonderful..
- Wonderful, Malkanjaan


1013
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.170
What's this?

1014
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:33.770
The man who made 'Aam Sandesh'!
What brings you here?


1015
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:39.250
Are you..

1016
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.610
Come with me, get up.
- No.


1017
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.130
Get up, I say.

1018
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:46.610
You abandoned the shop
to buy intoxicants!


1019
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.650
Leave my hand!
- Let's go home.


1020
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:50.410
Slowly..
Be careful.


1021
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:53.330
We're in a crisis..
- Stop it!


1022
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:57.130
You took an advance for making
a new kind of sweet.


1023
01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:59.010
Where's the money
to prepare the sweets now?


1024
01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:02.410
Chandu loves money
and money loves Chandu.


1025
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:07.410
The owner of the shop had come.

1026
01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.170
He says if we don't pay the rent
within the week


1027
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:11.410
he'll evict us.
- So, let him! - What!


1028
01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:13.090
How will we survive
without the shop?


1029
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:15.250
The only way to save the shop

1030
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:16.610
is to prepare
the new variety of sweet.


1031
01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:18.210
It's the only way to save you
and me!


1032
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:20.170
Try to understand!

1033
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:24.130
How many more people
do you want to ruin?


1034
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:30.010
This is Nobin.
He makes fantastic sweets.


1035
01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:34.370
And you fool people
to arrange for intoxicants.


1036
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:38.970
How much do you need?

1037
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.970
How much do you need?

1038
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:47.410
You..

1039
01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:50.850
Rs. 2.

1040
01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:57.970
I apologise for interrupting
the show.


1041
01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.010
It's all right.

1042
01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:03.410
I shall be back in a few moments.

1043
01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:05.490
Okay.
- All right.


1044
01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.050
Why are you giving me the money?

1045
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:15.170
Call it my wish or my will.

1046
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.010
I've destroyed many a homes.

1047
01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:21.530
This gesture might help save
at least a shop


1048
01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:24.810
if not a home.

1049
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:30.010
You..
- Don't make me waste my breath.


1050
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:32.210
My voice is very precious.

1051
01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:36.530
Here.

1052
01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:39.410
Take it.

1053
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:45.090
I'll return the money
when I can, ma'am.


1054
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:53.970
Go.

1055
01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:01.770
Let go.
- Move quietly!


1056
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.810
I'm feeling dizzy.
Don't push me around.


1057
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.730
Hey!
What are you doing?


1058
01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:16.610
Step back.
Look what's going on here.


1059
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:20.090
I can't stand so much dust
and smoke.


1060
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:21.970
You've taken an advance, remember?

1061
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:24.610
You ought to take responsibility
for it.


1062
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:27.090
What..
- Keep your voice down.


1063
01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.730
Go buy some saffron, pistachios

1064
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.570
sultanas and some candied mangoes.

1065
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:33.890
Oh! This is our last attempt.
- Yes.


1066
01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:36.730
There's too much dust
and smoke here.


1067
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:39.050
Yes!

1068
01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:41.970
My name is Amritlal Banik.

1069
01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:44.330
And I'm Mahesh.
So what?


1070
01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:47.410
Sweet!
I'd like to meet Mr. Nobin.


1071
01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:48.770
Oh, I see.

1072
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:50.690
Nobin!
- Yes?


1073
01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:52.730
Look, someone's here to meet you.

1074
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:53.930
I'm coming.

1075
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:57.330
Here, take over.

1076
01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:59.410
Me?
- Yes.


1077
01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:00.490
Oh, dear!

1078
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:03.290
Hello.

1079
01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:04.690
Why are you still here?

1080
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:06.650
Get going now or we'll be late.

1081
01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:34.570
You're making
a new variety of sweet, right?


1082
01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:36.970
Yes, it's a work-in-progress.

1083
01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:38.330
Don't worry,
it will be delivered on time.


1084
01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:40.050
No, I'm not worried about that.

1085
01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.530
I'm here to talk about
your ownership


1086
01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:42.690
over the new recipe.

1087
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.970
Sir, we can talk about all that
later.


1088
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:46.410
I'll be in a big mess
if I get late.


1089
01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:49.130
Please come later. You can have
whatever sweets you like.


1090
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:52.210
Sweet.

1091
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:56.490
What's this?

1092
01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:30.490
Please have another one.
- Enough..


1093
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:33.210
Have another one.

1094
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:35.650
It's quite nice.
- Yes.


1095
01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:05.410
Hey..

1096
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:08.930
Is this your novelty creation?
You want to kill us all?


1097
01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:11.970
Come with me..
- Look what you've done!


1098
01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:15.730
Beat him up!

1099
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.770
Beat him up..

1100
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:22.370
Oh, please!
Stop it!


1101
01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:24.850
We won't spare him!

1102
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:34.410
You've tainted my reputation.

1103
01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:36.290
Mahesh!

1104
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.610
No!

1105
01:09:38.650 --> 01:09:39.970
Beat him up!

1106
01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:57.490
Mahesh.

1107
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:59.930
I won't make sweets again.

1108
01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:03.250
Never again in my life.

1109
01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:18.570
At least hear me out.

1110
01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:21.570
Hey, Nobin!

1111
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:27.690
Look at him, ma'am.
It's been days


1112
01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:30.890
and he's been sitting around
at home, sulking.


1113
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:34.010
Why don't you talk some sense
into him?


1114
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:35.330
What do you want me to tell him?

1115
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:37.250
As if he listens
to any advice of mine..


1116
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:40.490
Why don't you talk to him, dear?

1117
01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.210
What will she say?

1118
01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:44.850
Her husband,
who spends the whole day at work


1119
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.530
hasn't stepped out of the house
in days.


1120
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:47.770
Is she even bothered?

1121
01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:50.250
Back in our days

1122
01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:52.610
if the husband was humiliated,
the wife would die of shame.


1123
01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.130
Nowadays, they don't care a bit.

1124
01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:57.530
What a lousy wife
I got for my son!

1125
01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:00.210
She's very young..
- Young?


1126
01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:02.810
I was married at the age of nine.

1127
01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:04.770
At her age,
I had already had Nobin.


1128
01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:06.330
Young, as if!

1129
01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:09.210
Usually, she's a motormouth.

1130
01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:11.490
If I knew she'd be like this,
I'd never have brought her home.


1131
01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:14.370
I'd never have got my son
married to her.


1132
01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:18.090
No..
Hey..


1133
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:19.250
Look..

1134
01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:29.050
Nobin.

1135
01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:34.170
What sort of husband are you?
Get up.


1136
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:42.730
Back in our days,
if the wife was humiliated


1137
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:43.810
the husband would die of shame.

1138
01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:47.050
I don't understand your generation.

1139
01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:04.410
Khirod.

1140
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:07.450
Khirod.

1141
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:24.450
Khirod, what are you doing here?

1142
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:26.610
Why have you come here?

1143
01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:28.250
I came looking for you, Khirod.

1144
01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:31.450
Even I came looking for someone.

1145
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:34.570
You did?
Who?


1146
01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:38.410
Remember the boy
who played the drums


1147
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:40.250
at the poetry recitals
at our house?


1148
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:44.250
The one who stole glances at me
while I played..


1149
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:47.370
The one who spent
sleepless nights making sweets..


1150
01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.810
The one who promised
to make me a sweet


1151
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:54.570
which will be soft,
tender and round


1152
01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:55.730
like the full moon?

1153
01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.010
The one who never gave up..

1154
01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.170
I'm looking for that boy.

1155
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:03.450
That boy.

1156
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:08.890
That boy is lost forever, Khirod.

1157
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:14.930
If we don't find him

1158
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:17.730
I too will lose myself forever.

1159
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.050
I failed, Khirod.

1160
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:30.490
I'm a failure..

1161
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:35.090
I failed.

1162
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:03.690
Why did you make sweets?

1163
01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:05.410
For me and yourself.

1164
01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:06.770
Then how does it make a difference

1165
01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:09.450
as to what anyone else says?

1166
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.290
There will be many hurdles.

1167
01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.530
No matter what anyone else says

1168
01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:26.050
you will definitely reignite

1169
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:31.130
the light of my peaceful home.

1170
01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:33.330
Let people think ill of you.

1171
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.770
Let rumours be spread.

1172
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:38.530
I, Khirod, will always be
by your side


1173
01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:41.210
and so will your sweets.

1174
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:46.770
I won't give up, Khirod.

1175
01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:50.530
I'll never let you down.

1176
01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:53.930
I know you won't.

1177
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:16.810
So, Nobin..

1178
01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.410
What are you up to these days?

1179
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:20.610
Nothing yet,
but I'll start something soon.


1180
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:24.290
You always say you will
but you don't.


1181
01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:28.530
I'll set up my confectionery
opposite to yours.


1182
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.250
What is it, Kanha?

1183
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:48.810
You're flying too high nowadays.

1184
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:51.970
Bihari.
- Get up.


1185
01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:53.170
Go over there.
- Go on.


1186
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.650
Make him bite the dust.

1187
01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:56.970
It's all right, go now.

1188
01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:00.650
Sir. - Yes?
- I don't think Bihari can do it.


1189
01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:03.610
Let's see if he can.

1190
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.130
Mr. Braja.

1191
01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:09.970
Braja, the wrestler, not mister.

1192
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:12.610
Braja, the wrestler.

1193
01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:18.130
Are you here to wrestle Kanha?

1194
01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:20.570
No..
- No.


1195
01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:23.610
I've come to hire something.

1196
01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:28.530
Do you think I'm a ruffian?
A goon?


1197
01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:30.570
Those are the kinds of things
you hire


1198
01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.690
not wrestlers.
- No.


1199
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:36.130
I want to take your shop
on rent. - Shop?


1200
01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:41.210
I want to rent out your shop
in Baghbazar


1201
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:43.210
opposite to Kalidas Indra's shop.

1202
01:16:44.010 --> 01:16:46.810
Your brother's house
adjacent to the shop..


1203
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.370
We're tenants there.

1204
01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:52.650
Slam him..
- Go on. - Yes!


1205
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.250
What will you sell at the shop?

1206
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:59.090
I'm planning
to start a confectionery.


1207
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:00.570
What!
- Yes.


1208
01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:02.210
You'll start a confectionery

1209
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:04.570
opposite to Kalidas Indra's shop?

1210
01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:13.850
I have a better idea.

1211
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:19.650
Go wrestle Kanha.
Go on.


1212
01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:23.930
Kanha will defeat me at wrestling

1213
01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:26.970
the way I'll defeat him
at making sweets.


1214
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:29.330
I'm not a wrestler.

1215
01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:34.290
I'm a confectioner.
- Wonderful. Well said.


1216
01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:38.170
Did you hear him?
- Yes, sir.


1217
01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:39.850
Listen, my boy.

1218
01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:43.130
Deposit two months' rent

1219
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.610
which amounts to Rs. 7.
- Rs. 7!


1220
01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:48.890
That's too much.
- People have approached me


1221
01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:50.690
with better offers.

1222
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:53.010
Pay if you can or..
- I'll take it.


1223
01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:56.050
But I'll need at least ten days.

1224
01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:57.770
Mr. Braja..

1225
01:17:59.050 --> 01:17:59.970
Braja, the wrestler..

1226
01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:03.330
I really need the shop.

1227
01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:05.610
Please don't rent it out to anyone

1228
01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:07.690
in these ten days.

1229
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.850
If it's so urgent,
I give you seven days.


1230
01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:13.210
If you pay the deposit,
the shop is yours


1231
01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:15.090
otherwise not.

1232
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:18.370
Knock out.

1233
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:22.530
Need money, do you?

1234
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:25.690
But, my boy

1235
01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:29.250
I don't lend money to children.

1236
01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:35.050
You may leave, lad.

1237
01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:38.890
Look.

1238
01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:42.610
It's all right,
I'll lend you the money.


1239
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.370
But you have to

1240
01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:45.450
mortgage something
in exchange for it.


1241
01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:47.170
What did you say?
Mortgage something?


1242
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:51.090
Yes. Documents, jewellery..
Anything will do.


1243
01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:53.490
Oh, I see. - Yes.
- The interest won't be much.


1244
01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:55.490
Only 10 percent.

1245
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.090
10 percent!
- Yes.


1246
01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:01.970
No one is ready to give me
a chance.


1247
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:07.050
What can I do?
Does money grow on trees?


1248
01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.890
'I don't lend money
to children', he says.


1249
01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:12.450
Am I a child?
Until old people make way


1250
01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:13.690
how will new talent emerge?

1251
01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:17.130
Khirod, someone
has to come to our aid, isn't it?


1252
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.130
Everyone starts somewhere.

1253
01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:22.490
How do I rent the shop?

1254
01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:30.010
What's this?

1255
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:31.970
What are you doing?
- For your shop.


1256
01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:35.650
Your jewellery?
- Yes.


1257
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:37.610
Have you lost your mind, Khirod?

1258
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:41.290
Your jewellery..
Shame on me!


1259
01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:49.130
Who says it's jewellery?

1260
01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:52.170
It's just gold.
- Yes, but..


1261
01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:55.610
Have you ever seen me wearing them?

1262
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:59.770
You're my real treasure.

1263
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:02.650
But..
- No ifs and buts.


1264
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:04.490
Go set up your shop.

1265
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:09.730
Won't you return my belongings
today as well?


1266
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:11.850
Did you repay the full amount?

1267
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:14.810
Have you paid the interest?
Go now. - Okay.


1268
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:21.970
Come in, my boy.
Come in.


1269
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:26.090
I'll lend you the money.
Hey! The money..


1270
01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:33.970
Get out!
Get out.


1271
01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:36.850
Who do you think I am?
A money lender?


1272
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:38.210
Do I lend money on interest

1273
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:41.250
that you've brought
your wife's jewellery? - No, I..


1274
01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:43.770
Nobin, I told you, 
I'd support you.

1275
01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:45.490
Did I ask you to bring
your wife's jewellery?


1276
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:46.930
Pick it up..

1277
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.130
The poor wife..
He took all her jewellery.


1278
01:20:50.170 --> 01:20:52.050
What a shame!
It's a sin!


1279
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:55.570
I went to a money lender.

1280
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:58.810
But I realised that if I pawned
the jewellery there


1281
01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:00.250
I'd never get it back.

1282
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:02.850
That's why I came to you.

1283
01:21:04.090 --> 01:21:05.690
Why did you go to a money lender?

1284
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:07.250
You should've come to me
straightaway!


1285
01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:09.450
You want to start
a confectionery, right?


1286
01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:13.450
Will one gold coin suffice?

1287
01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:19.650
I.. I don't need that much.
- Keep it.


1288
01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:22.930
Use the money
to set up your new shop.


1289
01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:25.330
It will take you some time
to start earning profits.


1290
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:28.010
Ma'am.

1291
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:33.170
I'll surely return the money.

1292
01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:36.530
I know, Nobin.
I've lived long enough


1293
01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:38.010
to know a good
man when I see one.

1294
01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:42.250
If you do well, you'll help others
along the way.


1295
01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:46.410
That's all right.

1296
01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:53.450
Don't bow your head again.

1297
01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:03.290
Bihari did it.
Can you?


1298
01:22:06.010 --> 01:22:07.010
I think so.

1299
01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:12.970
"The impossible
can be made possible."


1300
01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:15.530
"What will be, will be."

1301
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:19.250
"The dark clouds are gone."

1302
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:25.810
"Listen, O wanderer.
It is time to smile"


1303
01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:29.970
"for the world
follows in your footsteps."


1304
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:35.930
"You are the wind
beneath the wings"


1305
01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:40.810
"that your dreams will soar on."

1306
01:22:41.410 --> 01:22:43.850
"You are the direction"

1307
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:46.450
"that dreams follow
to find success."


1308
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:51.170
"It is now time
to make a fresh start."


1309
01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:56.570
'One year later.'

1310
01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:11.010
Do you have 'Makha Sandesh'?

1311
01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:12.610
We were here first.

1312
01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:18.090
Why is there no one at the counter?

1313
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:20.810
Who will make the sweets then?

1314
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:25.090
He's just rolling white dumplings
all day.


1315
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:28.770
As if he's building the Taj Mahal.

1316
01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:31.770
I wonder when it will be done..

1317
01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:33.490
Don't comment on things
you don't understand.


1318
01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:34.810
Right.

1319
01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:36.850
Only he understands.

1320
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:39.170
He's Ram Raja Mohan Roy.

1321
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:42.290
What!
Ram Raja Mohan Roy?


1322
01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:45.370
It's Raja Ram Mohan Roy.
- It's all the same.


1323
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:47.210
For how long will this go on?
- Rubbish..


1324
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.530
It's all right to work
on your invention


1325
01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:50.050
but you have to make
other sweets too.


1326
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:52.170
How will you earn money?
- Yes.


1327
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:54.690
There.

1328
01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:56.650
This is the problem with you women.

1329
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:59.570
First, you say.. Make sweets.
Then you say.. Make money.


1330
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:01.930
You yourself don't know
what you want.


1331
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:03.770
What is it with your inventions?

1332
01:24:03.930 --> 01:24:05.970
It's been two years
and still no results.


1333
01:24:06.090 --> 01:24:08.130
We're broke because of it!

1334
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:10.850
It's going to result in nothing,
I know it.


1335
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:13.050
So, what do you think I'm doing?

1336
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:14.970
Who am I doing this for?

1337
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:16.930
What are you looking at?

1338
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:28.490
Daughter-in-law.

1339
01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:29.690
Call Nobin.

1340
01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:31.490
It's quite late, you should eat.

1341
01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:33.850
If this goes on,
soon, we'll have no food.


1342
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:35.850
Why?
What's wrong?


1343
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:38.370
Mother-in-law, I've decided

1344
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:41.290
to man the counter at the shop
from inside.


1345
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:44.290
I'll deal with the milkman,
money lender, etc.


1346
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:46.370
The lady of the house
will man the shop!


1347
01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:50.370
We'll go broke otherwise.

1348
01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:52.410
We're already neck deep in debt.

1349
01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:55.690
If the shop isn't run efficiently,
we'll soon be penniless.


1350
01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:59.610
Look, I've put up with
a lot of Nobin's idiosyncrasies


1351
01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:02.570
but this.. I can't.
What will people say?


1352
01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:06.250
If you talk like that,
what will people say?


1353
01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:08.490
People will talk anyway

1354
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:10.290
whether we do anything or not.

1355
01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:12.810
You've got a point.

1356
01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:16.810
Even Nobin's father was like him.

1357
01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:19.770
I couldn't bring prosperity
to this family.


1358
01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:25.490
Let's see if you can.
Here you are.


1359
01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:28.490
Take it.

1360
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:33.490
It's all right.

1361
01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:40.290
I charge one or two annas
per can of milk.


1362
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:42.170
I sometimes even charge four annas.

1363
01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:45.410
I decide the price I sell milk at.

1364
01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:47.690
Take it if it suits you
or buy your own cow.


1365
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:50.490
You can't raise the price
whenever you feel like it.


1366
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:53.450
If you raise the prices,
we'll have to do it too.


1367
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:56.490
Considering how your shop is going

1368
01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:58.530
you all don't sell anything anyway.

1369
01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:01.210
Look, I won't waste time
discussing business


1370
01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:02.970
with a woman.

1371
01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:05.530
Will you buy milk at this price
tomorrow?


1372
01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:08.770
Yes, we will.
- All right.


1373
01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:19.530
The shop is empty.

1374
01:26:20.490 --> 01:26:22.610
Let's go.
- Please wait, sir.


1375
01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:25.450
Please stop.
Tell me what you need.


1376
01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:28.090
What is this that I see, Natobar?

1377
01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:30.570
Mr. Mahesh.. - Yes?
- There are customers..


1378
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:35.090
Well, I want some 'Ledikeni'
and he wants some Sandesh.


1379
01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:39.250
Do we have these? - No.
- We don't have them.


1380
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:41.970
But we do have some
'Dedo Sandesh' and 'Chhana Poda'.


1381
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:44.210
What!
Such strange names!


1382
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:47.170
This is all you'll get
in a shop like this.


1383
01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:48.530
Nothing else.

1384
01:26:48.690 --> 01:26:49.650
Don't you understand

1385
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:51.850
why the shop is lying empty?
Let's go.


1386
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:53.250
Let's go to the other shop.
- Let's go.


1387
01:26:58.090 --> 01:26:59.330
Listen, Khirod!

1388
01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:06.890
What!

1389
01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:11.690
Hey.. Hey, listen..
Hey, Nobin..


1390
01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:26.170
Can I say something
if you don't mind?


1391
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.930
Yes.

1392
01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:31.450
You're worried about Nobin
unnecessarily.


1393
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:34.410
His shop seems to be
on the verge of shutting down.


1394
01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:37.930
The snake's venom glands
must be removed


1395
01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:39.130
while it's still a baby.

1396
01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:43.290
Otherwise,
neither the snake charmer


1397
01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:44.290
nor the snake itself can tell

1398
01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:46.450
how venomous
it will turn out to be.


1399
01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:50.250
He created a new variety of sweet
in an hour.


1400
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:51.290
He's no ordinary talent.

1401
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:56.130
I wish I could taste
his 'Aam Sandesh'.


1402
01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:58.250
He hasn't made any of that
in a while.


1403
01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:00.450
He's just been rolling dumplings
for the last two years.


1404
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:05.010
One who doesn't value time

1405
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:08.450
certainly makes his family
worry about him.


1406
01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:22.650
Where to?

1407
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:26.930
Bandel, to Mr. 
Paulo's house.

1408
01:28:27.690 --> 01:28:30.370
He has called us for a recital
in the morning.


1409
01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:33.810
Can I come along?

1410
01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:38.250
Take the boat ashore!

1411
01:28:59.970 --> 01:29:02.330
"Oh, dear!"

1412
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:09.850
"O my friend, the wanderer."

1413
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:14.890
"When will you be back?"

1414
01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:21.130
"Do tell me, my friend."

1415
01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:25.250
"Oh, dear!"

1416
01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:32.770
"O my friend, the wanderer."

1417
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:37.610
"When will you be back?"

1418
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:43.370
"Do tell me, my friend."

1419
01:30:05.170 --> 01:30:09.690
"Leave if you must, my friend"

1420
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:12.330
"but do leave me"

1421
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:16.690
"a memento."

1422
01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:23.290
"Leave if you must, my friend"

1423
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:26.010
"but do leave me"

1424
01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:30.290
"a memento."

1425
01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:34.530
"O my friend"

1426
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:37.650
"the wanderer."

1427
01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:41.730
"When will you be back?"

1428
01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:44.410
"Do tell me"

1429
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:48.610
"my friend."

1430
01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:13.570
"The love"

1431
01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:17.610
"of my dear friend"

1432
01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:21.690
"is like the cool shade"

1433
01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:25.890
"of a banyan tree."

1434
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:31.090
"The love"

1435
01:31:31.130 --> 01:31:35.530
"of my dear friend"

1436
01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:39.170
"is like the cool shade"

1437
01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:44.130
"of a banyan tree."

1438
01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.250
"O my friend"

1439
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:50.770
"the wanderer."

1440
01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:55.370
"When will you be back?"

1441
01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:57.650
"Do tell me"

1442
01:31:57.690 --> 01:32:02.090
"my friend."

1443
01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:08.730
"When will you be back?"

1444
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:11.370
"Do tell me"

1445
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:16.090
"my friend."

1446
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:22.570
"When will you be back?"

1447
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:25.090
"Do tell me"

1448
01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:29.970
"my friend."

1449
01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:35.410
Wonderful!

1450
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:38.130
Wonderful!

1451
01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:39.970
Beautiful..

1452
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:41.770
You sing so well.

1453
01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:43.490
Where do you live?
What's your name?


1454
01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:47.130
I'm Nobin Chandra Das
from Baghbazar.


1455
01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:49.690
I'm a confectioner.
Music is my hobby.


1456
01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:51.650
So, we have something in common.

1457
01:32:51.930 --> 01:32:52.810
Cannon!

1458
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:55.330
Why a cannon?

1459
01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:57.450
W
-What have I done, sir?

1460
01:32:57.490 --> 01:33:01.210
I mean, both of us love cooking.

1461
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:03.770
Both of us love music.

1462
01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:06.370
That's what's common.
- Oh!


1463
01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:09.090
Don't be afraid, he's praising you.

1464
01:33:09.610 --> 01:33:10.490
Oh.

1465
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:12.370
William, bring some cake.

1466
01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:16.650
Cake?
Wow..


1467
01:33:18.490 --> 01:33:19.370
He's William?

1468
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:22.970
Horo..
William Horo.


1469
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:26.330
Oh, a spoon!

1470
01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:28.490
Have you had this before?

1471
01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:30.490
I've seen Englishmen eat it.

1472
01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:33.370
Tell me what's in it.

1473
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:34.490
I know what it is.

1474
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:36.050
It's 'chhana'!

1475
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:38.810
Yes, it is.
We call it cottage cheese.


1476
01:33:43.730 --> 01:33:46.370
Oh!
But how come it's so fine?


1477
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:48.130
Your cottage cheese is rough.

1478
01:33:48.330 --> 01:33:50.890
We make it smoother.

1479
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:52.490
You make it coarse
while the Englishmen


1480
01:33:52.530 --> 01:33:53.730
make it smoother.

1481
01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:54.770
Oh.

1482
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:58.090
I have a request, sir.

1483
01:33:58.290 --> 01:33:59.130
Tell me.

1484
01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:03.690
C
-Can I see your kitchen?

1485
01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:06.290
I mean, can you show me the process

1486
01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:08.570
you follow
for preparing cottage cheese?


1487
01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:10.130
Sure.
- You will?


1488
01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:13.210
Of course I will.
But..


1489
01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:16.090
You'll have to sing another song.

1490
01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.890
Wow.
- Look.


1491
01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:29.010
This is your kitchen?

1492
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:34.450
That's lemon.
We too..


1493
01:34:35.650 --> 01:34:36.490
Be patient.

1494
01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:50.290
That's whey.

1495
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:57.530
So, adding the whey to the milk

1496
01:34:59.170 --> 01:35:00.570
is what makes the cheese so smooth.

1497
01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:01.970
So, that's the secret.

1498
01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:07.210
Sir, now, I'm going to use
this technique


1499
01:35:07.770 --> 01:35:09.450
in my invention, Rasgulla.

1500
01:35:10.570 --> 01:35:12.890
Rasgulla?
- A dumpling soaked in syrup.


1501
01:35:13.930 --> 01:35:15.570
Rasgulla.
What's that?


1502
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:16.650
Well, sir..

1503
01:35:22.770 --> 01:35:24.210
It's my life.

1504
01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:28.370
It's the love of my life.

1505
01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:31.250
Love..

1506
01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:33.250
Remember, my young friend..

1507
01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:36.370
Love is all about keeping promises.

1508
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:47.730
Rasgulla..
It will happen.


1509
01:35:54.690 --> 01:35:55.570
Nobin.

1510
01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:00.490
Where have you been, my son?

1511
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:02.970
Why do you do this?

1512
01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:04.530
We've been so worried.

1513
01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:07.450
I won't do it again, I promise.

1514
01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:11.650
Go in.

1515
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:16.930
Khirod!
My invention is going to work.


1516
01:36:18.650 --> 01:36:22.090
I went all the way to Bandel.

1517
01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:24.130
I met Mr. Paulo there.

1518
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:27.690
He kept calling it Rasgulla.

1519
01:36:28.210 --> 01:36:29.730
Nice name, isn't it?
Rasgulla..


1520
01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:30.850
Hey, where are you going?

1521
01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:34.770
You'll do whatever you like

1522
01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:35.730
under the pretext of your invention

1523
01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:36.890
and we'll have to tolerate it!

1524
01:36:36.930 --> 01:36:38.370
No more excuses.

1525
01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:40.570
I'm sure it will work this time.
The Rasgulla.


1526
01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:41.850
Sweets again!

1527
01:36:41.890 --> 01:36:43.370
Is that all you ever think about?
- Yes!


1528
01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:55.010
You're always in my heart.

1529
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:58.930
I know you'll hurt me again.

1530
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:00.490
I won't hurt you again, Khirod.

1531
01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:03.530
I promise.
I swear on you.


1532
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:06.450
This time, the Rasgulla will work.

1533
01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:45.690
Mr. Mahesh!

1534
01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:58.930
It works!
Our sweet is ready!


1535
01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:25.410
Where are we going?
- Don't you remember?


1536
01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:40.250
Here you go.

1537
01:38:42.370 --> 01:38:43.890
The sweet
that looks like the full moon.


1538
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:46.970
I feed you every day.

1539
01:38:48.610 --> 01:38:50.530
Why don't you feed me today?

1540
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:52.290
Me?

1541
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:23.330
You know

1542
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.090
a bridge
is about to be constructed here.


1543
01:41:25.410 --> 01:41:26.650
The journey
to Howrah Railway Station


1544
01:41:26.730 --> 01:41:28.090
on the other side
will become much easier.


1545
01:41:29.130 --> 01:41:30.090
That's all right.

1546
01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:31.970
But the construction
hasn't started yet.


1547
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:35.410
They're just doing the publicity.

1548
01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:36.490
Publicity is important.

1549
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:38.650
Just making something good
isn't enough.


1550
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:41.490
People must be made to know
about it.


1551
01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:43.050
This new sweet you invented..

1552
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:45.770
We must spread the word
about it too.


1553
01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:47.730
From now on, any customer who comes

1554
01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:49.490
to your shop,
should be served the Rasgulla


1555
01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:51.010
even if he doesn't buy anything.

1556
01:41:51.210 --> 01:41:52.090
Just like that.

1557
01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:54.130
You'll see,
it will build a market for you.


1558
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:55.210
You know me so well.

1559
01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:58.130
I love serving people food.

1560
01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:01.210
But the financial aspect
is something


1561
01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:03.490
I don't like dealing with.

1562
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:08.370
When will you grow up?

1563
01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:11.170
What's the use of growing up?

1564
01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:13.810
You're there for me.
- Yes.


1565
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:17.930
Stop it!
People are looking.


1566
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:21.690
Here you go.

1567
01:42:23.730 --> 01:42:26.730
Hello, Hemen.
Is Mr. Kalidas in? - Yes.


1568
01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:30.130
Hemen! - Yes?
- Go inside.


1569
01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:31.730
They can't find anything in there.

1570
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:33.970
Why must I deal
with such nincompoops?


1571
01:42:35.610 --> 01:42:36.570
Yes?

1572
01:42:37.450 --> 01:42:38.850
Good morning, Mr. Kalidas.

1573
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:40.730
Here are some Rasgullas from Nobin.

1574
01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:42.850
It's a novelty.
It's very nice.


1575
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:52.810
Looks like the shop
isn't doing too well.


1576
01:42:53.730 --> 01:42:55.650
I see you're going door-to-door.

1577
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:58.130
No, we're making decent sales.

1578
01:42:59.530 --> 01:43:02.010
Khirod said I should
distribute samples


1579
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:03.850
of our novelty item to everyone.

1580
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.210
What's so special
about these Rasgullas?


1581
01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:07.650
It's just another sweet.

1582
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:15.770
The scent of love

1583
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:18.970
long sleepless nights

1584
01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:22.450
and peace of mind
have gone into making it.


1585
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:25.370
And most importantly

1586
01:43:26.690 --> 01:43:29.090
this is the answer
to all our struggles.


1587
01:43:30.450 --> 01:43:31.330
Leave.

1588
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:45.290
Even flies won't sit on it.

1589
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:48.730
Dad, I'm so thirsty!

1590
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:52.690
You always need
something or the other.


1591
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:55.730
You're either hungry or thirsty.

1592
01:43:56.970 --> 01:43:58.410
Wait, let me look.

1593
01:43:59.290 --> 01:44:01.170
Give me the sweets first.
Eight pieces of 'Gaja'.


1594
01:44:01.290 --> 01:44:04.290
I've eaten two and taken eight.
Ten in total.


1595
01:44:04.410 --> 01:44:06.610
Give it to me.
- How much for this?


1596
01:44:06.690 --> 01:44:08.010
Coachman!
- Yes, sir?


1597
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:10.330
Stop the carriage at a place
where we can drink water.


1598
01:44:10.530 --> 01:44:11.410
Okay.

1599
01:44:11.490 --> 01:44:13.490
There are confectioneries
on either side of the road.


1600
01:44:13.650 --> 01:44:15.730
It's crowded outside
the shop on the left.


1601
01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:18.370
Okay.
- This one is closer.


1602
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:19.850
Okay, dear.
Get down.


1603
01:44:23.650 --> 01:44:24.650
Come, my child.

1604
01:44:29.610 --> 01:44:30.650
Hello, sir.

1605
01:44:31.210 --> 01:44:32.570
Can I have some water to drink?

1606
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:34.090
Yes.

1607
01:44:38.530 --> 01:44:40.130
No..
I don't need any sweets.


1608
01:44:40.210 --> 01:44:41.130
I just need some water.

1609
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.090
Please have a seat.

1610
01:44:43.530 --> 01:44:45.050
Come.
- Please sit down.


1611
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:46.570
We're Bengalis.

1612
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:50.050
We don't serve people just water.

1613
01:44:50.650 --> 01:44:52.290
Please have some sweets
and then drink water.


1614
01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:53.810
Please have a seat.

1615
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:55.530
Here you go.
Have it.


1616
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:56.970
Hold it.

1617
01:44:59.490 --> 01:45:02.210
Dad, the sweet is delicious!

1618
01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:03.570
Is that so?

1619
01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:08.690
Is it nice, sir?
- What's this called?


1620
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:10.290
It's called Rasgulla.

1621
01:45:10.330 --> 01:45:12.290
I'll take all of it.

1622
01:45:12.490 --> 01:45:15.450
You'll take all the Rasgullas?
- Yes, I will.


1623
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:17.690
Parcel them.

1624
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:19.410
Mahesh!

1625
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:22.490
The sweet is delicious!
- Yes.


1626
01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:23.490
It's very nice.

1627
01:45:25.930 --> 01:45:26.850
Give me the sweets in a clay pot.

1628
01:45:28.770 --> 01:45:31.530
I'll take them
in a basket made of leaves.


1629
01:45:31.650 --> 01:45:32.730
I'll take extra syrup.

1630
01:45:32.850 --> 01:45:34.290
Please hurry up, mister!

1631
01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:46.210
Very nice!

1632
01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:51.930
Nobin's shop?

1633
01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:01.730
Where's my parcel?

1634
01:46:02.050 --> 01:46:03.490
Count how many people there are.

1635
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:04.570
Sorry?

1636
01:46:08.850 --> 01:46:13.690
I want more.

1637
01:46:13.810 --> 01:46:15.330
Give me some.

1638
01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:16.490
Here it is.

1639
01:46:16.650 --> 01:46:17.690
And what about me?

1640
01:46:17.770 --> 01:46:19.930
There's this for you.

1641
01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:22.370
Rasgullas.
- Rasgullas!


1642
01:46:22.770 --> 01:46:25.170
Listen, give it to her quickly.
- Okay.


1643
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:29.450
The gentleman sent this for you.

1644
01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:44.050
Mr. Sudhir, what's all this?

1645
01:46:44.130 --> 01:46:45.410
My son-in-law is visiting.

1646
01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:48.250
A whole Rohu fish
and a pot of Nobin's Rasgullas..


1647
01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:50.330
It's the least
I'll have to treat him to.


1648
01:46:50.410 --> 01:46:51.330
You're right.

1649
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:55.010
I decide the price of milk.

1650
01:46:56.650 --> 01:46:58.450
Take it or leave it.

1651
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:14.050
You seem to have lost your way.

1652
01:47:15.650 --> 01:47:18.410
I never thought you'd cross over
to my shop.


1653
01:47:20.410 --> 01:47:21.690
Lord Krishna had to cross the sea

1654
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:22.970
when the situation demanded.

1655
01:47:25.330 --> 01:47:26.330
What do you need?

1656
01:47:27.250 --> 01:47:29.650
This monopoly
related to the price of milk


1657
01:47:30.370 --> 01:47:31.970
has to be stopped, isn't it?

1658
01:47:35.650 --> 01:47:37.530
Monopoly?
- You don't think so?


1659
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:41.090
Previously, only Kashi charged
a premium amount.


1660
01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:43.850
Ever since my sales went up

1661
01:47:43.930 --> 01:47:45.890
all the milkmen have started
hiking their prices.


1662
01:47:45.970 --> 01:47:48.170
Your sales, your profit,
your problem.


1663
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:52.210
You're an inventor.

1664
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:55.290
Find a solution.

1665
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:57.010
I'll find something all right

1666
01:47:57.970 --> 01:48:00.690
be it a sweet
or the solution to a problem.


1667
01:48:03.730 --> 01:48:05.050
Will the milkmen agree to it?

1668
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:08.370
I alone can't stand up to them.

1669
01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:10.730
Unless we unite against them

1670
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:12.730
they'll continue to harass us
like this.


1671
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:14.970
Kalidas didn't agree to it.

1672
01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:16.290
Will the others cooperate?

1673
01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:18.010
Mr. Kalidas is scared of me.

1674
01:48:18.490 --> 01:48:20.090
But he respects you.
- I see.


1675
01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:21.890
If you agree to lend your support

1676
01:48:21.970 --> 01:48:23.530
I'll convince the others
to join us.


1677
01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:24.570
Goodness!

1678
01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:28.410
Nobin, both your behaviour
and your demeanour


1679
01:48:28.730 --> 01:48:30.050
have become sweet.

1680
01:48:30.490 --> 01:48:32.490
You all have got us
in a tight spot.


1681
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:35.890
So, we've been compelled
to gather here.


1682
01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:38.450
Milkmen, please get this
loud and clear.


1683
01:48:39.370 --> 01:48:40.770
If you don't decide
on a uniform price


1684
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:42.130
for the milk being sold
all over Kolkata


1685
01:48:42.650 --> 01:48:44.730
no confectioner will buy
a single drop of milk


1686
01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:46.050
from any of you.

1687
01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:51.810
So, tonight,
at the Bowbazar Milk Market


1688
01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:53.690
we'll decide
a standard price for milk


1689
01:48:54.010 --> 01:48:56.770
and all over Kolkata,
milk will be sold


1690
01:48:56.850 --> 01:48:58.210
at that very price.

1691
01:48:59.210 --> 01:49:01.650
How can you hike milk prices
as and when you please?


1692
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:03.370
Do you have no shame?

1693
01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:05.490
Just because only the confectioners
are here


1694
01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:08.690
it doesn't mean that we
are the only consumers of milk.


1695
01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:12.250
Young children,
those who are unwell..


1696
01:49:12.810 --> 01:49:13.850
Even they consume milk.

1697
01:49:15.010 --> 01:49:18.770
Business doesn't mean
cheating people.


1698
01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:23.730
You can do business
in an ethical manner.


1699
01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:27.370
Those of you who agree to it
need to raise your hands.


1700
01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:31.050
Raise your hands.

1701
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:33.810
Anyone?
Raise your hands, please!


1702
01:49:37.210 --> 01:49:39.370
What's your name?
- Ganguram!


1703
01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:42.010
"Slowly.."

1704
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:43.130
"The wind picks up."

1705
01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:47.290
"The wind picks up"

1706
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:49.010
"slowly.."

1707
01:49:49.930 --> 01:49:53.490
"It ushers in news"

1708
01:49:55.130 --> 01:49:59.850
"that becomes a folktale."

1709
01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:02.610
"Slowly, the wind picks up."

1710
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:06.050
"The wind picks up slowly."

1711
01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:08.610
"Who knows..
It could turn"


1712
01:50:08.730 --> 01:50:11.210
"into a formidable tempest."

1713
01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:13.890
"O young blood.."

1714
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:15.890
"Rescue the helpless!"

1715
01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:19.010
"O young blood.."

1716
01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:21.450
"Break all the shackles!"

1717
01:50:21.570 --> 01:50:24.370
"O young blood.."

1718
01:50:24.450 --> 01:50:26.410
"Rescue the helpless!"

1719
01:50:26.770 --> 01:50:29.530
"O young blood.."

1720
01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:32.250
"Break all the shackles!"

1721
01:50:42.930 --> 01:50:45.410
"The burden on our shoulders
is not light"


1722
01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:47.850
"but carry it, we must."

1723
01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:50.370
"You wield the oars
to your own boat."


1724
01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:53.210
"You shall see yourself through."

1725
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:55.810
"The burden on our shoulders
is not light"


1726
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:58.610
"but carry it, we must."

1727
01:50:58.690 --> 01:51:00.890
"You wield the oars
to your own boat."


1728
01:51:00.930 --> 01:51:03.330
"You shall see yourself through."

1729
01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:05.410
"Slowly, the wind picks up."

1730
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:08.810
"The wind picks up slowly."

1731
01:51:09.010 --> 01:51:11.490
"Who knows..
It could turn"


1732
01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:13.970
"into a formidable tempest."

1733
01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:16.490
"O young blood.."

1734
01:51:16.650 --> 01:51:18.730
"Rescue the helpless!"

1735
01:51:19.050 --> 01:51:21.730
"O young blood.."

1736
01:51:21.930 --> 01:51:24.210
"Break all the shackles!"

1737
01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:26.930
"O young blood.."

1738
01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:29.250
"Rescue the helpless!"

1739
01:51:29.650 --> 01:51:32.250
"O young blood.."

1740
01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:34.810
"Break all the shackles!"

1741
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:41.290
I'm Roopchand Pakshi.

1742
01:51:41.490 --> 01:51:45.770
Feed me some Rasgullas.
I'll turn you into a bird


1743
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:47.090
and teach you how to fly.

1744
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:48.370
He doesn't want to fly.

1745
01:51:49.170 --> 01:51:51.730
Your songs are the pride
of Baghbazar.


1746
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:54.770
It's not me, it's you!

1747
01:52:01.450 --> 01:52:03.850
"The impossible
can be made possible."


1748
01:52:03.970 --> 01:52:06.330
"What will be, will be."

1749
01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:10.690
"The dark clouds are gone."

1750
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:14.450
"Listen, O, wanderer."

1751
01:52:14.610 --> 01:52:16.970
"It is time to smile"

1752
01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:20.970
"for the world
follows in your footsteps."


1753
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:26.770
"You are the wind
beneath the wings"


1754
01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:31.090
"that your dreams will soar on."

1755
01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:34.850
"You are the direction"

1756
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:37.210
"that dreams follow
to find success."


1757
01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:42.410
"It is now time
to make a fresh start."


1758
01:52:42.650 --> 01:52:44.930
"Slowly, the wind picks up."

1759
01:52:45.330 --> 01:52:48.530
"The wind picks up slowly."

1760
01:52:48.610 --> 01:52:50.970
"Who knows..
It could turn"


1761
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:53.490
"into a formidable tempest."

1762
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:56.050
"O young blood.."

1763
01:52:56.210 --> 01:52:58.210
"Rescue the helpless!"

1764
01:52:58.650 --> 01:53:01.290
"O young blood.."

1765
01:53:01.450 --> 01:53:04.250
"Break all the shackles!"

1766
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:11.410
Come on.

1767
01:53:14.250 --> 01:53:15.930
Keep an eye on the rear exit.
- Okay.


1768
01:53:22.530 --> 01:53:24.570
Thief..

1769
01:53:24.690 --> 01:53:25.970
Is anyone here?

1770
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:28.530
There's a thief here!

1771
01:53:28.650 --> 01:53:30.250
We're confectioners, not thieves.

1772
01:53:30.330 --> 01:53:31.810
Just a minute.
- Liars!


1773
01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:32.970
You're confectioners?
- Yes.


1774
01:53:33.090 --> 01:53:35.930
Your Rasgullas are really popular.

1775
01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:37.970
We thought we'd sneak in
and try to find out


1776
01:53:38.010 --> 01:53:39.850
how they're made.
- What's this?


1777
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:41.050
Leave.

1778
01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:42.850
Go on.
What are you waiting for?


1779
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:44.490
Please get up.

1780
01:53:44.530 --> 01:53:47.050
They're Rasgulla thieves..
- Mahesh!


1781
01:53:47.410 --> 01:53:48.810
Look at their enthusiasm.

1782
01:53:49.290 --> 01:53:50.570
I'll teach you.
- You will?


1783
01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:51.490
Yes.

1784
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:52.770
You'll teach us?
- Yes. - What..


1785
01:53:53.170 --> 01:53:57.570
From the milk and back into it.
- Okay.. - See?


1786
01:53:57.690 --> 01:53:59.210
I'm from Krishna Nagar.

1787
01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:00.610
I'm from Belgachia.

1788
01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:01.970
I'm from Burdwan.

1789
01:54:02.010 --> 01:54:03.290
I'm from Baraha Nagar.

1790
01:54:05.490 --> 01:54:08.810
You know, Mr. Ram Mohan..
- It's Braja Mohan.


1791
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:10.770
When will you gain prudence?

1792
01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.090
I've been telling you this
for so many days


1793
01:54:12.130 --> 01:54:13.530
but you just don't listen.

1794
01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:14.490
How long?

1795
01:54:14.530 --> 01:54:15.930
How long will you keep giving away

1796
01:54:15.970 --> 01:54:16.850
the recipe for the Rasgulla?

1797
01:54:16.890 --> 01:54:18.010
I've told you many times..

1798
01:54:18.090 --> 01:54:19.010
Haven't I told you not to speak

1799
01:54:19.050 --> 01:54:20.130
with your mouth full?

1800
01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:22.690
Have you finished
your morsel of food?


1801
01:54:23.010 --> 01:54:24.610
I didn't even speak.

1802
01:54:24.650 --> 01:54:25.770
But, Khirod

1803
01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:27.570
I don't teach those many people
nowadays.


1804
01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:30.090
I wonder why
you're always angry with me.


1805
01:54:30.130 --> 01:54:31.530
Why wouldn't I be?

1806
01:54:31.570 --> 01:54:33.570
How can you just give away
the recipe


1807
01:54:33.650 --> 01:54:35.010
for which you struggled so much?

1808
01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:37.810
Can I say something?

1809
01:54:38.290 --> 01:54:39.290
Will you listen if I said 'no'?

1810
01:54:39.330 --> 01:54:42.090
Should I say it now or later?
- Just say it!


1811
01:54:42.450 --> 01:54:44.170
I have to go to Burdwan to teach..

1812
01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:52.810
I'm going to teach the Englishmen.

1813
01:54:54.090 --> 01:54:55.730
Mr. Dulal..
Oh!


1814
01:54:56.850 --> 01:54:57.730
Careful.

1815
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:59.490
Are you all right?
- Yes.


1816
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:03.090
Hemen, call Dulal.

1817
01:55:03.450 --> 01:55:06.490
Actually, no one has patented
a sweet before.


1818
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:09.250
So, I want to be
the first one to do it.


1819
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:10.410
Stall your hard work.

1820
01:55:12.210 --> 01:55:13.370
Better try this one.

1821
01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:19.450
Impressed..

1822
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:22.010
Because you underestimated me.

1823
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:25.610
I'm one of the few native Indians

1824
01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:28.330
who's a graduate.

1825
01:55:29.250 --> 01:55:32.010
Try this.
It's a new invention.


1826
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:37.530
Serve him the Rasgullas you made.

1827
01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:38.930
He makes the Rasgullas.

1828
01:55:39.010 --> 01:55:39.930
He made the Rasgullas?

1829
01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:41.890
Yes, I learnt the recipe
from Mr. Nobin.


1830
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:44.090
Who knows that?
- What do you mean?


1831
01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:46.490
I mean, serve Mr. Banik
the Rasgullas


1832
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:47.530
that you've invented.

1833
01:56:01.570 --> 01:56:03.250
Not everyone can value fame.

1834
01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:07.610
And is it right to hand it out

1835
01:56:08.890 --> 01:56:10.570
to the ones
who don't appreciate it?


1836
01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:14.130
It's not right.

1837
01:56:16.130 --> 01:56:16.970
The sweet.

1838
01:56:19.730 --> 01:56:21.410
Had you eaten
Mr. Nobin's Rasgullas


1839
01:56:21.490 --> 01:56:22.330
you'd have known what I mean.

1840
01:56:23.170 --> 01:56:24.690
Let me try handing the laurel

1841
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:26.090
to the one who deserves it.

1842
01:56:26.170 --> 01:56:28.890
If he refuses,
I'll come back to you.


1843
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:33.450
See you.
Excuse me.


1844
01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:39.370
Would you like to have one?

1845
01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:48.570
I'll have the real one
if I have to.


1846
01:56:52.450 --> 01:56:53.330
Impressive!

1847
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:56.810
A female entrepreneur!
It's the future.


1848
01:56:58.290 --> 01:57:01.090
Hello.
I patent things.


1849
01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:02.570
What 'tent'?

1850
01:57:03.370 --> 01:57:06.730
Sweet.
I said patent, not tent.


1851
01:57:07.930 --> 01:57:10.330
In the future..
Going ahead, no matter who


1852
01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:13.370
in the entire world,
makes Rasgullas


1853
01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:15.330
you'll be paid for it.

1854
01:57:16.610 --> 01:57:18.210
Really?
- Yes.


1855
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:20.610
I don't want to hear anything.

1856
01:57:20.690 --> 01:57:22.170
You must apply for a patent.

1857
01:57:22.210 --> 01:57:23.170
I don't want a patent.

1858
01:57:23.410 --> 01:57:25.210
Why?
What's the problem?


1859
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:26.410
Try to understand.

1860
01:57:26.650 --> 01:57:28.770
I've taught many people
the recipe by now.


1861
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:30.490
If I ask them to pay me

1862
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:31.770
would it be fair to them?

1863
01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:35.490
It's like giving seeds
to a farmer to sow


1864
01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:37.370
and then telling him
that he can't use


1865
01:57:37.410 --> 01:57:40.970
any seeds for farming but mine.

1866
01:57:41.290 --> 01:57:42.170
That's not done.

1867
01:57:42.490 --> 01:57:43.450
What happened?

1868
01:57:43.690 --> 01:57:44.570
Oh!

1869
01:57:44.610 --> 01:57:46.050
What about the coconut?

1870
01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:49.850
So, you won't apply for a patent?

1871
01:57:50.170 --> 01:57:53.290
No, my husband
just won't agree to it.


1872
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:54.250
That's not good.

1873
01:57:54.490 --> 01:57:57.250
You all invented the recipe.

1874
01:57:58.130 --> 01:57:59.890
And now, everyone is making it.

1875
01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:02.290
If one of them gets the patent

1876
01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:04.210
you'll lose your ownership over it.

1877
01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:07.450
Then you might have to pay money

1878
01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:09.130
to someone else
for your own invention.


1879
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:11.690
See you.

1880
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:16.170
What are you doing?

1881
01:58:16.210 --> 01:58:17.250
I want to hear nothing!

1882
01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:18.450
Will you apply for the patent
or not?


1883
01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:19.490
Why are you getting angry?

1884
01:58:19.530 --> 01:58:20.890
Why shouldn't I be?

1885
01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:22.490
Why should we pay someone else

1886
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:23.570
for our own invention?

1887
01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:25.130
I wonder what he said to you..

1888
01:58:25.210 --> 01:58:26.970
Dad, can we play..
- Go away!


1889
01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:28.930
Go away, I say!

1890
01:58:29.570 --> 01:58:30.450
Great!

1891
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:33.730
These people you teach..

1892
01:58:33.770 --> 01:58:34.970
What do they give you?

1893
01:58:35.010 --> 01:58:36.170
Just a shawl?

1894
01:58:36.250 --> 01:58:37.090
Khirod, I'm..

1895
01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:39.370
I'm telling you for the last time..

1896
01:58:39.450 --> 01:58:40.330
Get it loud and clear.

1897
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:43.490
If I ask for money
from the people whom I've taught


1898
01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:44.890
people will say that I taught them

1899
01:58:45.090 --> 01:58:45.970
as per my convenience

1900
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:47.810
and now, I'm manipulating them
for money.


1901
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:49.170
That's all you care about.

1902
01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:50.930
You just want people
to sing your praises.


1903
01:58:50.970 --> 01:58:51.810
What!

1904
01:58:51.850 --> 01:58:54.050
What do you want?
Should we die of hunger?


1905
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:57.290
Look, if you don't apply
for a patent


1906
01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:59.010
I'll leave with our son!

1907
01:58:59.050 --> 01:59:00.570
And I'll never come back.
- I will not


1908
01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:04.130
apply for a patent.

1909
01:59:04.210 --> 01:59:08.770
"O my friend"

1910
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:13.210
"the wanderer."

1911
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:14.130
Khirod!

1912
01:59:14.610 --> 01:59:19.250
"When will you be back?"

1913
01:59:19.290 --> 01:59:21.690
"Do tell me"

1914
01:59:21.770 --> 01:59:26.210
"my friend."

1915
01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:31.130
"O my friend"

1916
01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:37.570
"the wanderer."

1917
01:59:37.610 --> 01:59:41.890
"When will you be back?"

1918
01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:44.530
"Do tell me"

1919
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:48.650
"my friend."

1920
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:51.290
Khirod, open the door.

1921
01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:53.610
Have you got the patent?

1922
01:59:54.010 --> 01:59:56.930
Why do you always bring it up?

1923
01:59:56.970 --> 01:59:59.690
Your wife might put up
with all your whims


1924
02:00:01.330 --> 02:00:02.930
but a mother won't.

1925
02:00:03.570 --> 02:00:07.610
You promised me, right?
That you won't make me cry anymore.


1926
02:00:10.050 --> 02:00:10.930
Tell me!

1927
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:14.050
"Leave if you must, my friend"

1928
02:00:14.250 --> 02:00:16.650
"but do leave me"

1929
02:00:16.690 --> 02:00:21.010
"a memento."

1930
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:23.570
"O my friend"

1931
02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:28.170
"the wanderer."

1932
02:00:28.210 --> 02:00:32.210
"When will you be back?"

1933
02:00:32.450 --> 02:00:34.810
"Do tell me"

1934
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:39.210
"my friend."

1935
02:00:49.450 --> 02:00:52.090
Hey, give me five Rasgullas.
- You are..


1936
02:00:52.170 --> 02:00:54.130
Hemen!
You're here after a long time!


1937
02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:55.770
Please pack me five Rasgullas.

1938
02:00:55.810 --> 02:00:58.530
You've come here after a long time.
Please come in..


1939
02:00:58.610 --> 02:01:00.290
I won't eat those.
Mr. Kali will..


1940
02:01:01.770 --> 02:01:04.850
I wasn't supposed to say that.
Please don't tell anyone.


1941
02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.610
Mr. Kali will have them, right?
- No..


1942
02:01:06.650 --> 02:01:09.250
Come quickly!
Listen!


1943
02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:13.330
Mr. Kali will eat Rasgullas!
- I didn't say anything!


1944
02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:39.970
The price of milk is the same
everywhere in Kolkata now.


1945
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.930
What do you want?

1946
02:01:42.250 --> 02:01:46.330
Actually, I came to offer you
some Rasgullas.


1947
02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:49.570
To me!
Why?


1948
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:55.970
They say one needs the blessings
of one's elders in bad times.


1949
02:01:56.730 --> 02:01:57.610
That's why..

1950
02:02:00.090 --> 02:02:04.650
Your business is flourishing.
You can't be braving bad times.


1951
02:02:05.850 --> 02:02:07.130
But Khirod doesn't live with me
anymore.


1952
02:02:10.050 --> 02:02:11.570
What will I do with all the money?

1953
02:02:17.170 --> 02:02:18.090
Please!

1954
02:02:50.050 --> 02:02:52.210
It's okay.
It's fine.


1955
02:03:00.930 --> 02:03:02.330
Bye.
- Okay.


1956
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:06.210
Wait.

1957
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:18.530
Will you teach me?

1958
02:03:18.690 --> 02:03:23.930
"O blessed being of the Lord!"

1959
02:03:26.890 --> 02:03:31.130
Hey! I'll beat you up badly!
Get out!


1960
02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:32.610
What is this, Bipin?
Bipin!


1961
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:35.050
What's going on?
- He's been troubling me..


1962
02:03:35.090 --> 02:03:37.250
I don't want any excuses.
No.


1963
02:03:37.290 --> 02:03:39.650
This shouldn't be repeated.
Offer him some water.


1964
02:03:42.090 --> 02:03:42.970
Sir.

1965
02:03:46.330 --> 02:03:48.810
How are you?

1966
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:59.970
Eat slowly!
- Drink some water..


1967
02:04:02.090 --> 02:04:02.970
Eat slowly.

1968
02:04:03.010 --> 02:04:06.450
What do I say?
Drink slowly.


1969
02:04:09.010 --> 02:04:14.210
I wronged you many times.
- That's okay.


1970
02:04:14.730 --> 02:04:16.290
The business wasn't supposed
to flourish at that time.


1971
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:17.210
That's why it didn't.

1972
02:04:17.410 --> 02:04:19.170
No.

1973
02:04:20.170 --> 02:04:23.410
The sweets weren't adulterated.

1974
02:04:24.370 --> 02:04:27.410
A few pellets of intoxicants

1975
02:04:27.450 --> 02:04:31.130
fell into the syrup from my pocket
by mistake.


1976
02:04:32.170 --> 02:04:36.490
I couldn't tell you out of fear.

1977
02:04:36.970 --> 02:04:39.370
Please forgive me!

1978
02:04:39.930 --> 02:04:42.090
Please forgive me!

1979
02:04:42.130 --> 02:04:44.450
Mahesh, it was fine!

1980
02:04:45.570 --> 02:04:47.170
The sweets were fine, Mahesh!

1981
02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:51.210
Mr. Chandu, you've done me
a great favour!


1982
02:04:51.730 --> 02:04:52.850
I'll invent a new sweet.

1983
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:57.290
I'll offer that new sweet to Khirod
and bring her back home.


1984
02:04:57.330 --> 02:04:59.690
Our relationship is really sweet,
right? - Absolutely!


1985
02:05:00.010 --> 02:05:03.410
Mr. Chandu, what's your name?
- My name is Chandu.


1986
02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:04.450
What's your proper name?

1987
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:08.250
It's been a while since someone
called me by that name.


1988
02:05:08.290 --> 02:05:10.370
After my mother's demise..

1989
02:05:10.410 --> 02:05:12.730
I'll call you by that name.
Tell us the name.


1990
02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:16.450
Baikuntha Gangopadhyay.

1991
02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:19.770
I'll name that sweet after you.
Okay?


1992
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:21.450
'Baikuntha Bhog.'

1993
02:05:23.610 --> 02:05:25.970
It will be done now.
He got the enthusiasm he needed.


1994
02:05:26.650 --> 02:05:28.050
But don't go anywhere.

1995
02:05:28.450 --> 02:05:29.930
Hey, listen!

1996
02:05:30.170 --> 02:05:33.970
Shave his beard and make him wear
some clean clothes.


1997
02:05:42.330 --> 02:05:44.890
Khirod!
Khirod, I'm here!


1998
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:49.250
I know that you don't want to see
my face.


1999
02:05:49.450 --> 02:05:53.050
But you should remember
that it's inauspicious for me


2000
02:05:53.090 --> 02:05:54.410
if I don't offer you
the new sweets that I make.


2001
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:58.650
Here! Please smell it.
I've invented a new sweet.


2002
02:05:58.730 --> 02:06:00.690
'Baikuntha Bhog!'

2003
02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:05.450
Offering you first is a ritual
otherwise I'd have had it first.


2004
02:06:06.250 --> 02:06:10.850
Khirod! Please don't do this.
Please hold it.


2005
02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:12.410
I've been running all my life.

2006
02:06:12.930 --> 02:06:17.370
Khirod, please don't do this.
Why are you angry with me?


2007
02:06:17.410 --> 02:06:20.130
Okay, I understood.
The patent, right?


2008
02:06:20.410 --> 02:06:24.650
We didn't have anything before
but we're doing well now.


2009
02:06:25.090 --> 02:06:28.210
We have a house, a shop,
our sweets and our son.


2010
02:06:29.890 --> 02:06:30.810
What happened?

2011
02:06:36.490 --> 02:06:39.770
Just imagine.. Had it been
someone else's hand..


2012
02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:41.970
How could you say that?
How dare you!


2013
02:06:42.010 --> 02:06:43.170
That's what I'm saying.

2014
02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:46.770
No matter how many people
make Rasgullas in this world


2015
02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:49.210
my hands

2016
02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:52.930
will be mine.

2017
02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:57.330
I'll invent
many new sweets, Khirod.


2018
02:06:58.410 --> 02:06:59.410
I just want you to be with me.

2019
02:07:00.050 --> 02:07:02.450
Have a look.
'Baikuntha Bhog.'


2020
02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:05.850
I've invented it.

2021
02:07:29.290 --> 02:07:30.770
When will you grow up?

2022
02:07:31.450 --> 02:07:33.050
