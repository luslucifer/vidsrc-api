00:53:57.778 --> 00:53:58.879
ALBERT: Hello, boy.
Where have you been?


1106
00:53:59.946 --> 00:54:00.948
I wish you could... Sorry.
The door was open.


1107
00:54:01.281 --> 00:54:02.814
Hi.

1108
00:54:02.816 --> 00:54:04.683
ALBERT: Oh. You forgot
your way home, did you?


1109
00:54:04.685 --> 00:54:06.384
Ooh! That looks nasty.

1110

You're getting
just like me.

(CHUCKLES)

1112
00:54:11.057 --> 00:54:15.694
I've checked everywhere I can
think of, although, stupidly,


1113
00:54:15.696 --> 00:54:17.162
forgot to check
just there.


1114
00:54:17.164 --> 00:54:18.165
What are you
doing here?


1115

BEN: Oh, I've known
Albert for years.


1116
00:54:20.334 --> 00:54:21.201
Yeah. If it wasn't for Ben,

1117
00:54:22.068 --> 00:54:23.701
I should still be lying
on that towpath.


1118
00:54:23.703 --> 00:54:25.104
(HUFFS)
Did you have a fall?


1119
00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:29.642
No, no, I usually walk about with
fish fingers on me head. Ben,


1120
00:54:29.876 --> 00:54:33.245
stick 'em in the freezer, will you?
I'll have 'em for me tea tomorrow.


1121
00:54:33.247 --> 00:54:36.050
(SIGHS) Good boy.
Good boy. You sit.


1122
00:54:36.816 --> 00:54:39.850
You had me worried sick, you did.
I didn't know where you'd gone.


1123
00:54:39.852 --> 00:54:42.689
And a chocolate digestive
wouldn't go amiss!


1124
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:45.825

a rescue committee? Huh.

You're welcome.

1126
00:54:47.894 --> 00:54:49.062
Must have blacked out.

1127
00:54:50.164 --> 00:54:52.763
Stubborn old bugger refuses
to go to the hospital.


1128
00:54:52.765 --> 00:54:53.733
You look nice.

1129
00:54:54.334 --> 00:54:55.834
Night out
with the girls?


1130
00:54:55.836 --> 00:54:56.703
No. I wish.

1131
00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:02.406
I think he's given
himself quite a scare.


1132
00:55:02.408 --> 00:55:04.241
Worst part
was losing Max.


1133
00:55:04.243 --> 00:55:05.877
Hmm.

1134
00:55:05.879 --> 00:55:07.081
Did you have
a nice time?


1135
00:55:08.247 --> 00:55:09.383
Not really.

1136
00:55:12.952 --> 00:55:15.486
I keep telling him he needs
to get himself a scooter.


1137
00:55:15.488 --> 00:55:17.723
ALBERT: I can't afford one.

1138
00:55:17.725 --> 00:55:19.256
At least there's nothing
wrong with his hearing.

1140
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.426
Er, she died last year.

Hmm.

1142
00:55:23.796 --> 00:55:25.665
Been married 50 years.
Wow.


1143

I'd last a weekend. (CHUCKLES)

1145
00:55:31.238 --> 00:55:32.673

Hmm.

muscles before you start, all right?


1150
00:56:09.877 --> 00:56:12.079
Otherwise, you'll end up
pulling something.

I don't usually put
them off that quickly.

They're usually quite keen until
they see my soft toy collection.

No, it wasn't you. It was me.
That was the vet.

and he's away working
for at least two years,

Nothing.
Nothing.

Ah. It doesn't look
like nothing to me.


1193
00:58:12.164 --> 00:58:13.531
This is my dad's car.
It needs, erm...


1194
00:58:13.533 --> 00:58:16.036
New tires. It needs...
New tires, new wheels.


1195

It's funny, 'cause I don't see
your dad anywhere 'round here.

tell anyone about this,

okay? But if I hear or catch any of
you doing something like this again,
