00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:25.123
<i>I've always been amazed
that asteroids can fly in groups...</i>


2
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.836
<i>...for millions of years
and never touch each other or connect.</i>


3
00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:32.630
<i>They are dead rock...</i>

4
00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.467
<i>...so they find their perfect orbit
and stick to it.</i>


5
00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:40.305
<i>We also want to find
that place of perfection.</i>


6
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:46.144
<i>But we're not asteroids.
We change, and that's the problem.</i>


7
00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.314
<i>The more you try to create a paradise...</i>

8
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.858
<i>...the more you will resent the prison.</i>

9
00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:56.279
<i>And all you're left with is dreams
of a future...</i>


10
00:00:57.197 --> 00:00:58.823
<i>...that never happened.</i>

11
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.586
<i>Unidentified pod approaching.</i>

12
00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.308
Scan ship identification code.

13
00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:49.726
<i>Scanning.</i>

14
00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:10.872
<i>Counting down. 
Five, four...</i>

15
00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:15.084
<i>...three, two, one...</i>

16
00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:32.519
Lieutenant Marlowe,
you're cleared for landing.


17
00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:35.939
Welcome to Omega 76.
Your room is number 3 on B Level.


18
00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:39.901
Get situated, report to Medical.
I'll meet you on the bridge at 1800 hours.


19
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.782
<i>Docking bay door opening.</i>

20
00:03:49.452 --> 00:03:51.538
<i>Docking bay door closing.</i>

21
00:03:54.707 --> 00:03:58.002
<i>Welcome to the Omega 76
refueling station.</i>


22
00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:01.422
<i>Are you in need
of food, lodging or fuel?</i>

23
00:04:02.048 --> 00:04:04.050
No, thank you.

24
00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:48.678
<i>Caution. UV rays present.</i>

25
00:04:49.095 --> 00:04:50.263
Mom?

26
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.152
<i>Main level. 
Elevator doors closing.</i>

27
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.155
Hello.

28
00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.108
<i>Lieutenant Commander Marlowe,
please report to the medical capsule.</i>


29
00:05:50.156 --> 00:05:52.158
It gives shots.

30
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.495
It's just a routine physical.

31
00:05:56.663 --> 00:05:58.832
They need to make sure
I didn't bring anything...


32
00:05:58.998 --> 00:06:00.875
...onto the ship they don't know about.

33
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.218
<i>Initiating diagnostic mammography.</i>

34
00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.809
<i>Glandular tissue results are normal.</i>

35
00:06:27.777 --> 00:06:29.028
It's cold.

36
00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:30.780
<i>Lieutenant Commander Marlowe...</i>

37
00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:33.867
<i>...I have detected some irregularities
in the uterus.</i>


38
00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.161
I'm aware of the irregularities.

39
00:06:38.037 --> 00:06:41.040
Dr. Bot, hi.

40
00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.542
<i>Welcome, Misty.</i>

41
00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:45.545
I need to tell you
I have just been feeling...


42
00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:48.256
...so much better
since we started treatment.


43
00:06:48.423 --> 00:06:51.301
I mean, like, even just my dreams
have just been better.


44
00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:54.721
You know, like, I haven't been having
all those feelings...


45
00:06:54.888 --> 00:06:57.015
...and I'm just really feeling
in the now.


46
00:06:57.182 --> 00:07:01.186
<i>Feelings can sometimes pull one out
of the now and put them in the then.</i>


47
00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:03.104
<i>Live in the now, not in the then.</i>

48
00:07:03.271 --> 00:07:05.732
I don't wanna be in the then.
I wanna be in the now.


49
00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:08.610
<i>Talking about the now can put one
in the then.</i>


50
00:07:08.776 --> 00:07:12.614
I don't want to be in the then, I want
to be in the now. I wanna move forward...


51
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.575
<i>Don't move too far forward,
you'll be out of the now.</i>


52
00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:17.827
- Not too far forward.
<i>Stay in the now.</i>


53
00:07:17.994 --> 00:07:21.873
I want to stay in the now.
I am in the now. Right now.


54
00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:25.376
This knob is the ship's thrust control...

55
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.379
...which works on a sliding scale of 50.

56
00:07:28.546 --> 00:07:30.882
Obviously, we'd never take it that far.

57
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:33.927
If, in the case of a proximity warning...

58
00:07:34.093 --> 00:07:37.764
...this red light here will go off
and an alert will sound...


59
00:07:37.931 --> 00:07:40.600
...which brings me
to the navigation systems.


60
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:44.187
Have you worked
with any of the F series?


61
00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:47.607
I have worked
with the entire F series, sir.


62
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:49.692
- F15?
- Yes, sir.


63
00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:52.111
You've navigated using the F15?

64
00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:53.404
Yes.

65
00:07:54.364 --> 00:07:58.701
- I don't know why you didn't stop me.
- I'm sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you.


66
00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:00.870
Well, the F15...

67
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:03.873
Well, little lady, 
I'm impressed.

68
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:07.043
- It's Jessica.
- What?


69
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.295
My name is Jessica, sir.

70
00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:14.717
I know your name, Lieutenant Marlowe.
Thank you.


71
00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:19.013
<i>Captain Glenn Terry,
here is your Harvey Wallbanger.</i>


72
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.765
- I didn't order that.
<i>- But sir...</i>


73
00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:23.184
I'd never order an alcoholic beverage
on the bridge.


74
00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:25.191
<i>- You ordered at exactly...</i>
- Ted ordered that.


75
00:08:25.353 --> 00:08:27.689
<i>- My records indicate you ordered...</i>
- Take that to Ted.


76
00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:32.527
So, well, I guess I can skip the
how-do-you-do's, and put you right to work.


77
00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:35.071
That's what I'm here for, sir.

78
00:08:42.704 --> 00:08:44.038
<i>Attention, crew.</i>

79
00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:48.209
<i>Tonight's luau begins in the rec room
at 1800 hours.</i>


80
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.013
- Could we not do that tonight?
- Yeah.


81
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:04.350
<i>Maintenance Technician Ted,
here is your Harvey Wallbanger.</i>


82
00:09:04.517 --> 00:09:07.020
- I didn't order that.
- I'll take it.


83
00:09:10.398 --> 00:09:12.066
How was your day?

84
00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:15.487
I just had some issues from today.

85
00:09:17.739 --> 00:09:19.824
Honey, you shouldn't take those with alc...

86
00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:24.787
- Anyway, my issue...
- Your issue, yeah.


87
00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:27.040
My issue
is we can barely afford to buy...


88
00:09:27.207 --> 00:09:31.920
- ...Sunshine's school tuition next year.
- I'll homeschool Sunshine, so don't worry.


89
00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:36.341
Okay. Yeah, should I...? Do you want
me to, maybe, help you out with that?


90
00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:38.718
We shouldn't be talking
about all this stuff...


91
00:09:38.885 --> 00:09:42.972
...right before we go to bed.
It's really stressful.


92
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:47.685
Okay. All right.

93
00:09:47.852 --> 00:09:51.397
Your whole vibe is just stressing me.

94
00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:53.441
Yeah.

95
00:10:07.497 --> 00:10:09.040
A female captain?

96
00:10:09.207 --> 00:10:11.918
Lieutenant Commander.
There aren't any lady captains.


97
00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:14.254
Like real captains,
as far as I know. Right?


98
00:10:15.338 --> 00:10:16.339
Right.

99
00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:21.761
Well, she just better wear a bra.
That's all I'm saying.


100
00:10:22.804 --> 00:10:25.014
Anyway, I do not know
what the fuss is all about.


101
00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:27.433
Can you imagine
if I had to run this ship?


102
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.435
I can't even make
our garbage disposal work.


103
00:10:29.602 --> 00:10:31.604
I would crash us right into a sun.

104
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:34.357
It's a good thing you're not
in control of the ship.


105
00:10:34.524 --> 00:10:35.942
I know, that's what I said.

106
00:10:39.863 --> 00:10:42.115
It's okay. I should get going.

107
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.514
Hey, how have things been
with you guys since the baby?


108
00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:08.683
- Great.
- Yeah?


109
00:11:09.184 --> 00:11:12.103
No, I mean, are you guys...?

110
00:11:12.937 --> 00:11:14.439
Is she still...?

111
00:11:15.523 --> 00:11:18.526
- Well, doesn't Misty?
- Oh, yeah.


112
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.447
Yeah, man, all the time.
It took a while, you know?


113
00:11:22.822 --> 00:11:25.366
Yep, we kept it alive
during the pregnancy.


114
00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:27.911
Found ways to get around it.

115
00:11:30.205 --> 00:11:32.207
- You see the new girl?
- No.


116
00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:33.541
Nice ass.

117
00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:35.543
I'm a leg man, you know?

118
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.548
Nice legs. Nice tits. Nice ass.
Oh, I would love to...


119
00:11:49.516 --> 00:11:51.935
- Would you?
- What?


120
00:11:53.394 --> 00:11:55.355
- Ever cheat?
- Hell, no.


121
00:11:58.066 --> 00:11:59.484
Fuck, yes.

122
00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:10.119
Welcome wagon! I'm Donna.

123
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.122
Greetings.
We are so happy that you're here.


124
00:12:13.289 --> 00:12:15.124
Really, thank you. That's a... That...

125
00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:18.002
I brought you a little something.

126
00:12:18.169 --> 00:12:20.046
For me? Wow, thank you.

127
00:12:20.213 --> 00:12:22.423
This is homemade paper?
Did you make this?


128
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.718
I'm very into arts and crafts.
You'll learn that about me.


129
00:12:26.052 --> 00:12:30.890
- And I make my own jewelry as well.
- That's very kind of you. Thank you.


130
00:12:31.057 --> 00:12:35.186
It's just a fun survival kit that I put together.
Just a bunch of helpful things.


131
00:12:35.353 --> 00:12:39.023
Oh, don't be precious. It's a little packet
of detergent to get you started...


132
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.067
...and also a map of the ship.

133
00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:43.027
Great, this is great. Thank you.

134
00:12:43.194 --> 00:12:44.821
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Very thoughtful.


135
00:12:44.988 --> 00:12:47.907
It's nothing.
So my number's right there up at the top.


136
00:12:48.324 --> 00:12:51.870
Listen, I know everything
about this ship...


137
00:12:52.036 --> 00:12:54.873
...so you just call me
if there's anything that you need.


138
00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:57.542
Great, thank you. I will. Thank you.

139
00:12:58.418 --> 00:13:01.337
Great. Well, I'm gonna take off
and get back to some things.


140
00:13:01.504 --> 00:13:04.215
- I understand.
- Yeah. So...


141
00:13:04.716 --> 00:13:07.385
- You have a good day.
- Thank you.


142
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.017
Okay, Carol, listen, I need to talk
to you about something.


143
00:13:19.606 --> 00:13:23.067
- All you people are fucking imbeciles!
- Okay, what if we...


144
00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:26.946
There's no "we," only you.
You. Do your job on your own!


145
00:13:27.697 --> 00:13:29.616
I am and I was, but I...

146
00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:32.869
No. No. There is no buts.
I'm not interested in your buts.


147
00:13:33.036 --> 00:13:35.330
Excuse me,
you guys got water showers?


148
00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:39.959
Yeah. Down the hall on the right.
Comes with a free breakfast.


149
00:13:40.126 --> 00:13:42.670
It's gonna feel so good
to get clean again.


150
00:13:53.556 --> 00:13:57.519
Hey, it is so great
to have more estrogen on the ship.


151
00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:01.523
- Nice to meet you.
- Just great to have more female energy.


152
00:14:01.689 --> 00:14:04.150
- Really balances things out.
- How are you?


153
00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:08.613
- That's my Sunshine.
- She's so beautiful. Really, I mean...


154
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.406
- Yeah.
- How old is she?


155
00:14:10.573 --> 00:14:12.826
How old do you think she is?

156
00:14:13.535 --> 00:14:15.078
Like, a guess?

157
00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:18.957
Like, I guess she's about 7?

158
00:14:19.123 --> 00:14:21.209
I like to think of her
as an old soul, so...


159
00:14:21.376 --> 00:14:25.004
Oh. She may be. Yeah.
But how old is she in people years?


160
00:14:25.171 --> 00:14:28.049
I don't really like
to label her in ages.

161
00:14:28.216 --> 00:14:31.219
Yeah, I just don't really believe
in ageism, so...


162
00:14:31.761 --> 00:14:34.055
Well, children are really wonderful.

163
00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:37.517
- We get wrapped up in our everyday lives.
- Yeah. That's true.


164
00:14:37.684 --> 00:14:40.061
How are you? What do you got there?

165
00:14:40.228 --> 00:14:42.605
You know, I was... Oh, well...

166
00:14:45.859 --> 00:14:48.862
I was gonna say if you ever
needed someone to babysit or to...


167
00:14:49.028 --> 00:14:52.490
Wow, I am picking up such
a great maternal energy from you.


168
00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:55.702
- Well, yeah, kids are great.
- Oh, my God. It's really beautiful.


169
00:14:55.869 --> 00:14:59.747
- Why don't you have children?
- Oh, my, you know, work and time...


170
00:14:59.914 --> 00:15:02.500
Oh, you've gotta have a child.
You really should.


171
00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:05.545
- It's amazing. Look at her.
- Yeah. Yeah, she's very beautiful.


172
00:15:05.712 --> 00:15:09.799
- I would love to. I mean, when I'm ready.
- Oh, but don't wait, okay? Don't wait.


173
00:15:09.966 --> 00:15:12.218
There's never the right time,
never enough money.


174
00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:14.762
- You have to feel the energy...
- It's not about money.


175
00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:16.598
...and commit and really decide.

176
00:15:16.723 --> 00:15:19.392
- I think the energy really opens up.
- I will. I will. I will.


177
00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:23.188
- Right now, it's about career for me and I...
- No, times have changed, okay?


178
00:15:23.354 --> 00:15:26.316
You can have your work, have your baby.
You just have to do it.


179
00:15:26.483 --> 00:15:28.818
- You just have to have your baby.
- You know what?


180
00:15:28.985 --> 00:15:31.488
I can't have a child,
so I won't be having a child.


181
00:15:31.654 --> 00:15:34.991
You can have a baby. Anyone can
have a baby. What are you talking about?


182
00:15:35.158 --> 00:15:38.203
You know,
I have an actual medical situation...


183
00:15:38.369 --> 00:15:41.623
...where I can't actually
physically have a child.


184
00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:44.375
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I'm saying?


185
00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:47.337
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

186
00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:51.758
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

187
00:15:51.925 --> 00:15:53.885
No, I mean, you didn't know.

188
00:15:54.052 --> 00:15:58.681
No, I didn't. I just... I...
But I'm so sorry for you. It is horrible.


189
00:15:58.848 --> 00:16:00.391
No, it's not horrible. It's okay.

190
00:16:00.558 --> 00:16:04.187
I'm so embarrassed. Look at me.
I have everything and I am sitting here...


191
00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:06.648
...taking all of my blessings for granted.

192
00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:10.026
You know, and I can have a child...

193
00:16:10.193 --> 00:16:13.863
...and here I am not even realizing
that you just can't and...


194
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.535
You know, we all have things, and I have
a career and I have a life, you know?


195
00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:21.412
And it's not the only way I, you know,
can have a child.


196
00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:23.706
I can adopt and it'll work out.

197
00:16:23.873 --> 00:16:26.292
You know, I'll have one.
It's not a big deal for me.


198
00:16:26.459 --> 00:16:29.879
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't get defensive, okay?


199
00:16:33.341 --> 00:16:37.220
I would really appreciate if you
didn't say anything to anyone, please.


200
00:16:37.387 --> 00:16:39.556
- Of course not. No.
- Okay. Thank you.


201
00:16:40.598 --> 00:16:43.184
- You're very lucky.
- I am so lucky.


202
00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:13.631
Mommy has to go to work.
Watch your school tapes.


203

216
00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:01.364
- Hello.
- Hi.


217
00:19:03.867 --> 00:19:05.952
I'd like to be Captain.

218
00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:11.416
Well, that's... 
It's a lot of responsibility.

219
00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:14.586
A lot of long hours, a lot of...

220
00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:18.506
Do you like your break?

221
00:19:19.048 --> 00:19:22.427
Yeah, I do. I like it a lot.

222
00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:27.515
It's one of my most favorite things
about being a Captain.


223
00:19:31.853 --> 00:19:34.481
Mommy said it's a bad thing
if you smoke.


224
00:19:34.647 --> 00:19:36.858
Yeah, it's bad. 
It's bad stuff.

225
00:19:37.525 --> 00:19:40.487
We learned in school
that's bad for your lungs.


226
00:19:40.653 --> 00:19:42.655
It can turn them black.

227
00:19:42.822 --> 00:19:44.824
Really? Wow, black.

228
00:19:45.074 --> 00:19:48.036
That's a... That's bad news.

229
00:19:49.871 --> 00:19:54.375
But thank you for the tip. Okay.

230
00:19:58.379 --> 00:20:00.882
- Do you like your job?
- Yeah, I like my job.


231
00:20:02.926 --> 00:20:05.678
- How much do you like it?
- I like it a lot. I love it.


232
00:20:05.845 --> 00:20:09.682
I'm a very, very lucky man.

233
00:20:09.849 --> 00:20:11.559
One day I made my own spaceship...

234
00:20:11.726 --> 00:20:14.187
...and I was headed towards ground,
and we couldn't...


235
00:20:14.354 --> 00:20:17.565
Isn't it really, really boring hanging out
with me up here?


236
00:20:17.732 --> 00:20:19.651
It's got to be boring to you.

237
00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:21.861
- My mom says...
- No, no, no.


238
00:20:22.028 --> 00:20:25.865
No mom. Go find your mom.
Search the entire ship for your mother.


239
00:20:27.367 --> 00:20:28.368
Okay?

240
00:20:29.077 --> 00:20:31.371
It's my break too, you know.

241
00:20:47.053 --> 00:20:49.848
<i>Honey, Sunshine, no. 
No, not yet, okay?</i>

242
00:20:50.014 --> 00:20:52.183
<i>The baby's too young.
You can't come and visit.</i>


243
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.103
<i>You don't know about germs on fingers
and it's just too soon.</i>


244
00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:59.440
<i>I'm not gonna tell you again. Thank you,
sweetie. I'm very sorry. But thank you.</i>


245
00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:24.674
Hello. Please watch where you step.

246
00:21:24.841 --> 00:21:28.803
Hey, yeah. Wow.
Got a lot of new plants here.


247
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.099
Yeah, I'm experimenting
with a new soy-based...


248
00:21:33.266 --> 00:21:36.478
There were some plants over there
that I was taking care of.


249
00:21:36.644 --> 00:21:38.813
Yes, don't worry.
I moved them to the back.


250
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.316
Okay. I'll be right back, okay?

251
00:21:42.317 --> 00:21:43.318
Hi.

252
00:21:48.031 --> 00:21:49.991
You never come to the Arboretum?

253
00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:54.287
No, we look at trees
in the projection room.


254
00:21:56.706 --> 00:21:58.208
No way.

255
00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:01.794
You've got to have the real thing.

256
00:22:02.462 --> 00:22:05.924
You've got to be able to touch them
and smell them.


257
00:22:06.174 --> 00:22:09.511
They give off oxygen, you know.
Did you know that? The stuff we breathe.


258
00:22:10.887 --> 00:22:13.807
There was a time when Earth
was covered in them...


259
00:22:13.973 --> 00:22:16.851
...and the animals would run freely
amongst them.


260
00:22:20.396 --> 00:22:23.942
Hey, don't worry about those plants
back there. I'll take care of those.


261
00:22:24.108 --> 00:22:26.361
- I can look after them.
- No, you know what?


262
00:22:26.528 --> 00:22:29.614
They're just really...
They're finicky and I'll just... I'll do it.


263
00:22:30.573 --> 00:22:32.575
Yeah. Sunshine, come on.

264
00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:38.957
Would it be okay if Sunshine
stayed here with me for a little while?


265
00:22:41.042 --> 00:22:44.295
Sure. Yeah, her mom
likes her home by 5.


266
00:22:44.462 --> 00:22:45.547
Okay.

267
00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:48.049
I'll see you later. 
Have fun, you two.

268
00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:31.426
Don't pick her up, sweetie.
She needs her rest.


269
00:23:31.593 --> 00:23:35.096
- When will the babies come?
- Well, any day now.


270
00:23:36.306 --> 00:23:40.101
Why don't you go get a sock out of your
dad's drawer and put it in there with her.


271
00:23:40.268 --> 00:23:42.061
That should make her
more comfortable.


272
00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:55.575
Where are you?

273
00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:08.004
Sir, yesterday on the ascension
over the neutrite...


274
00:24:08.171 --> 00:24:11.466
I noticed that you embanked
rather quickly?


275
00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:13.218
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

276
00:24:14.969 --> 00:24:18.681
Well, what happened was
we ran into an asteroidal pocket.


277
00:24:18.848 --> 00:24:21.184
Didn't really show up on the radar.

278
00:24:21.434 --> 00:24:24.062
If you'd have been here last month,
you would've seen it.


279
00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:26.481
- But...
- Kind of came out of nowhere.


280
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.652
- I also did notice...
- Yeah, I'm gonna have to ask you...


281
00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:33.404
...to stay on that, now,
if we're gonna discuss this.


282
00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:37.450
I also noticed when I was down
in the spacial archives...


283
00:24:37.617 --> 00:24:40.912
...a compilation of graphs
that I guess my predecessor...


284
00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:44.249
- Is his name Daniel, sir?
- Yeah.


285
00:24:44.415 --> 00:24:45.750
- Sir, Daniel?
- Yes.


286
00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:49.087
Yes. That Daniel put together
very, very well, I might add.


287
00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:51.297
I mean, they're really extraordinary...

288
00:24:51.464 --> 00:24:55.885
...graphing the trajectories and the way
for us to avoid asteroidal pockets.


289
00:24:56.052 --> 00:24:59.138
Yeah, I know, it's wonderful.
It's a very interesting idea.


290
00:24:59.305 --> 00:25:02.892
Well, I mean, I think this whole
"coming from out of nowhere" thing...


291
00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:05.186
...is a little dangerous. 
Don't you think?

292
00:25:05.353 --> 00:25:07.981
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'll give it some consideration later.


293
00:25:08.148 --> 00:25:10.859
Right now
I'm a little busy with my work.


294
00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:13.403
Well, I actually, sir, 
I have them here.

295
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.530
- Right.
- If you'd like to look at them.


296
00:25:15.697 --> 00:25:19.492
Yeah, I'm just a little busy
with my work.


297
00:25:20.535 --> 00:25:22.871
Okay. I will...

298
00:25:23.037 --> 00:25:27.041
I'll just leave them here for you
and maybe you could take a look...


299
00:25:27.208 --> 00:25:30.044
...at them when you're not...
- I have to speak to something.


300
00:25:30.211 --> 00:25:34.382
I don't know if my manner is brusque
or off-putting at times.


301
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:36.885
I don't know if as a woman
you find it that way.


302
00:25:37.886 --> 00:25:40.513
But I'm just trying
to do my work here, okay?


303
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.017
I'm very pleased with your work.
You're well-trained and efficient.


304
00:25:44.184 --> 00:25:48.897
I think this will be a good experience,
a learning experience for both of us.


305
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.025
- Right?
- Right.


306
00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:55.195
So I'm really happy
that you have new ideas.


307
00:25:55.361 --> 00:25:58.406
And I will let you know
when I'm ready to look at them.


308
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.580
No misunderstanding, sir.
I think men and women, we're all efficient.


309
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:07.874
Very good.

310
00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:50.834
- Hey.
- Hello.


311
00:26:54.254 --> 00:26:56.714
Hamburger day today.

312
00:27:14.691 --> 00:27:16.276
Oh. Were you...?

313
00:27:16.985 --> 00:27:18.862
Well, I was just gonna sit.

314
00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:20.822
- Yeah. I'm finished.
- Right.


315
00:27:23.199 --> 00:27:24.492
Right.

316
00:28:14.417 --> 00:28:16.753
<i>Water's warm, Glenn. 
Come on in.</i>

317
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.047
<i>Oh, it's hot.</i>

318
00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:24.052
<i>- But feels nice.
- No, this is nice. Get over here.</i>


319
00:28:48.535 --> 00:28:51.204
<i>Electrical overload in bath pod.</i>

320
00:28:51.746 --> 00:28:53.748
<i>Correcting power circuits.</i>

321
00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:03.091
<i>Electrical power stabilized.</i>

322
00:30:44.484 --> 00:30:45.485
Mom?

323
00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.687
Feel better?

324
00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:04.898
It looked like its head was gone.

325
00:32:05.064 --> 00:32:08.067
Yeah. It was.

326
00:32:08.401 --> 00:32:09.736
Where did it go?

327
00:32:11.488 --> 00:32:13.281
Mommy gerbil ate it.

328
00:32:14.199 --> 00:32:16.034
- Why?
- Did you touch it?


329
00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:17.327
No.

330
00:32:18.786 --> 00:32:22.332
Okay. Don't touch the babies.

331
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.044
It makes the mommy eat them.

332
00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:28.254
But why would she...?

333
00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:34.093
You have five more.
Just relax and let the pill work.


334
00:32:37.514 --> 00:32:39.849
You don't give drugs
to a 7 year old!

335
00:32:40.016 --> 00:32:42.769
- You could have killed our daughter!
- I only gave her half!


336
00:32:42.936 --> 00:32:45.355
I don't care how much!
Don't give her your Valium!


337
00:32:45.522 --> 00:32:50.610
- Do not tell me how to raise my daughter!
- Your daughter? She's mine too!


338
00:32:50.777 --> 00:32:53.196
- You need to chill out!
- I'm not gonna chill out!


339
00:32:53.363 --> 00:32:55.907
- I won't get catatonic like you do all day!
- God!


340
00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:59.327
<i>- I know what I am doing.
- You can't give drugs to our daughter.</i>


341
00:32:59.494 --> 00:33:01.788
<i>I can't talk about this with you.
I have to go!</i>


342
00:33:01.955 --> 00:33:05.542
<i>- I can't rehash it. I can't handle this.
- Fine, Misty!</i>


343
00:33:16.636 --> 00:33:17.804
<i>Ted?</i>

344
00:33:19.013 --> 00:33:20.598
Jessica?

345
00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:23.309
<i>- Do you have a moment?</i>
- Yeah.


346
00:33:23.518 --> 00:33:24.894
Hold on.

347
00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:38.491
Press 7-8-3-6-7-5-9-1.

348
00:33:43.079 --> 00:33:44.706
- Hi.
- Hey.


349
00:33:45.206 --> 00:33:47.876
Sorry, my hand was just recharging.

350
00:33:48.042 --> 00:33:50.712
The Captain's really getting on me
about the hydrogen tanks.


351
00:33:50.879 --> 00:33:54.591
I'm sorry. If I'd known you'd needed those,
I would have gotten them for you.


352
00:33:54.757 --> 00:33:57.051
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have come up so late.


353
00:33:57.218 --> 00:34:00.221
No, no, blame me, you know?
He blames me enough. Yeah.


354
00:34:00.388 --> 00:34:03.141
- It's just one more thing.
- Tell me about it.


355
00:34:03.725 --> 00:34:05.351
He does blame me?

356
00:34:05.518 --> 00:34:09.063
No. I'm... Not you. I'm... He blames me.

357
00:34:10.356 --> 00:34:14.194
- He blames everyone.
- Don't listen to him. He's so full of hot air.


358
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.363
I don't think he got a degree
in bedside manner, you know?


359
00:34:17.614 --> 00:34:19.908
Make sure the intercom's not on.

360
00:34:20.074 --> 00:34:22.410
Oh, right. Beep, you're an asshole.

361
00:34:24.954 --> 00:34:27.874
I'm sorry, I feel like I interrupted you.

362
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:30.043
No, no,
how's your first month on the ship?


363
00:34:31.878 --> 00:34:33.046
You know...

364
00:34:36.633 --> 00:34:40.428
- Could I ask you a question?
- Sure. Yeah.


365
00:34:41.221 --> 00:34:42.472
Do you...?

366
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:46.351
Why did Daniel leave?

367
00:34:46.518 --> 00:34:48.728
Oh, his family emergency.

368
00:34:49.646 --> 00:34:52.649
But the captain told me
that he got promoted.


369
00:34:54.275 --> 00:34:58.321
No, no, it was a family emergency.
I mean, it's not that easy to get promoted.


370
00:34:58.488 --> 00:35:01.658
You know, you have to put in your time
on a smaller ship, so...


371
00:35:01.825 --> 00:35:04.702
Like, I have two more years here
and then I...


372
00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:08.373
- I'm sorry, I'm boring you.
- No, you're not.


373
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.875
Would you like to sit down or just...

374
00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:13.628
- Sure. Thank you.
- Yeah.


375
00:35:15.255 --> 00:35:18.132
Oh, God! Sorry. 
Sorry about that.

376
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:19.717
Sorry.

377
00:35:22.387 --> 00:35:26.015
Yeah, so I...
We have two more years here...


378
00:35:26.182 --> 00:35:28.226
...and then we get sent
to a larger ship...


379
00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:31.312
...which I'm really hoping is
Starship 8 because they have...


380
00:35:31.479 --> 00:35:34.732
...kids running around everywhere.
I think Sunshine really needs that.


381
00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:40.071
- Oh, she's wonderful. She's extraordinary.
- Yeah, she's great. She's great, yeah.


382
00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:42.574
- And Misty's...
- She's good.


383
00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:45.451
- Yeah, she's good, so...
- Yeah.


384
00:35:48.204 --> 00:35:51.916
Oh, yeah, that's Sunshine.

385
00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:56.713
We don't let the robots clean up in here
because Misty and I grew up on Earth.


386
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.424
We didn't have robots
to do everything for you, so...


387
00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:04.095
I just feel like it's important for Sunshine
to learn to do things for herself, you know?


388
00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:08.641
Yeah, I've always wondered what it
would be like on Earth. I've never been.


389
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:10.810
- You've never been to Earth?
- No.


390
00:36:10.977 --> 00:36:12.437
You're kidding me?

391
00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.732
- I kid you not.
- Wow, you're really missing out.


392
00:36:15.899 --> 00:36:18.693
- That's what they say.
- So, what were you, a ship child?


393
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:23.698
- Did you grow up on a moon colony?
- No. My parents were separated so I just...


394
00:36:23.865 --> 00:36:26.201
...you know, went ship to ship.

395
00:36:27.327 --> 00:36:28.453
Yeah, I had...

396
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.081
- You okay?
- Yeah. Sorry, it's...


397
00:36:32.248 --> 00:36:33.833
It gets a little stiff sometimes.

398
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:36.377
Can I...?

399
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:40.173
- It's a Mach II right?
- Yeah. Yeah.


400
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.384
That's from before
the Quasar Revolution.


401
00:36:43.551 --> 00:36:45.720
- That's incredible.
- Yeah, it's...


402
00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:48.973
- Sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay. You just gotta...


403
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.226
- It has a mind of its own.
- Yes.


404
00:36:51.392 --> 00:36:55.480
It's military requisitions, so just gotta
take what they give you, you know?


405
00:36:55.855 --> 00:36:57.732
- You're so brave.
- Well...


406
00:36:58.358 --> 00:37:00.276
What battle was it from?

407
00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:07.033
No, I'm sorry, I understand if you don't
want to talk about it.


408
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:10.829
You don't have to say.

409
00:37:13.748 --> 00:37:14.999
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.


410
00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:17.502
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.


411
00:37:17.669 --> 00:37:20.004
- Hey.
- How are you?


412
00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.798
Great. Great.

413
00:37:23.466 --> 00:37:27.512
- How are you? Where were you?
- I was just programming the meals.


414
00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:30.348
Oh, your food programs, by the way,
are great.


415
00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:33.143
- Yeah, she does a great job.
- Ship 3 was awful.


416
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:36.396
- Hey, you know what? Let's have a drink.
...Oh, God, no. I...


417
00:37:36.563 --> 00:37:37.897
No, no, you have to!

418
00:37:38.064 --> 00:37:39.816
- Let's have a drink.
- No. Thank you.


419
00:37:39.983 --> 00:37:42.360
- Honey, she's got a lot of work.
- No, don't leave.


420
00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:44.821
Let's stay. Just a night cap.
Just a night cap?


421
00:37:44.988 --> 00:37:46.990
The tanks, maybe 9:30 tomorrow.

422
00:37:47.323 --> 00:37:50.243
I think the captain would like them
by then, just so you know.


423
00:37:50.994 --> 00:37:52.328
Yes, sir.

424
00:37:53.288 --> 00:37:54.372
- Okay.
- Bye.


425
00:37:54.622 --> 00:37:57.000
- See you soon.
- Take care.


426
00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:03.965
- How are you?
- How are you?


427
00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:05.884
Yeah, it's...

428
00:38:06.176 --> 00:38:07.343
Where were you?

429
00:38:12.682 --> 00:38:14.434
What is this? Sangria?

430
00:38:18.897 --> 00:38:21.774
It tastes off.
Does the fruit taste off to you?


431
00:38:24.611 --> 00:38:25.820
Seems fine.

432
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.997
You know what? Earrings. Earrings.

433
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:48.968
Honey, it's too soon. Just...
Let me get into it. Hold on. Keep going.


434
00:38:50.011 --> 00:38:51.888

<i>Triple bonus.</i>

Oh, yeah! Yeah!

440
00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:49.696
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:40:10.717 --> 00:40:13.178
<i>Game over! High score.</i>

442

00:40:32.113 --> 00:40:34.616
<i>- One moment, I'll connect you.</i>
- Thank you.


446
00:40:36.117 --> 00:40:37.452
<i>Hello.</i>

447
00:40:38.578 --> 00:40:41.873
- Daddy?<i>
- Sweetie! Oh, is that you?</i>

448
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.083
Hi. Hi.

449
00:40:44.417 --> 00:40:47.086
<i>Oh, darling, how are you?</i>

450
00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:56.513
Actually, I'm not feeling so good today,
and I just... I really want...


451
00:40:56.679 --> 00:41:00.099
<i>Hold that thought. Hold that one second.
I gotta go get the video phone.</i>


452
00:41:00.433 --> 00:41:04.187
No, I really... I just really needed
to hear your voice for a second.


453
00:41:04.354 --> 00:41:05.980
<i>There we go.</i>

454
00:41:06.481 --> 00:41:10.819
<i>Now, can you see me? 
Am I good?</i>

455
00:41:10.985 --> 00:41:14.447
Go a little bit more to your left.
We can just talk. I just really wanted...


456
00:41:14.614 --> 00:41:16.282
<i>How's this? 
Am I good here?</i>

457
00:41:16.449 --> 00:41:19.702
- I can't really see all of you. Back up... <i>
- Here? Am I in?</i>

458
00:41:19.869 --> 00:41:23.706
<i>Your mother was the one who knew
how to work this. Can you see me?</i>


459
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.709
Now it's a little bit close.
Just back up a little bit.


460
00:41:26.876 --> 00:41:28.878
<i>How about now?</i>

461
00:41:29.712 --> 00:41:31.214
- It's fine.<i>
- Yeah?</i>

462
00:41:31.798 --> 00:41:34.926
<i>Oh, good. Darling, how are you?</i>

463
00:41:36.886 --> 00:41:38.555
I'm great.

464
00:41:40.181 --> 00:41:42.433
Maybe you're playing your music
too loud.


465
00:41:49.524 --> 00:41:51.442
And you're not touching them?

466
00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:01.244
One left.

467
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.903
Ted?

468
00:42:38.364 --> 00:42:39.657
Oh, sorry. Hey.

469
00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:41.784
I'm just bringing her back.

470
00:42:41.951 --> 00:42:45.705
- No, thank you. Thanks for watching her.
- It was my pleasure.


471
00:42:51.419 --> 00:42:54.005
Oh, excuse us. 
We're dancing now.

472
00:43:43.054 --> 00:43:45.306
Horsie's going for a ride.

473
00:43:45.765 --> 00:43:48.685
- Okay. Honey, Daddy's leg is tired, okay?
- Okay.


474
00:43:50.436 --> 00:43:54.149
Hey, so Jessica seemed like
she was in a good mood.


475
00:43:54.315 --> 00:43:56.151
What were you guys talking about?

476
00:43:58.403 --> 00:44:00.989
Daddy, I wanna play
the anti-gravity game.


477
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:05.702
Okay, honey, you know what your mom
says about that, All right? It's not safe.


478
00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:08.496
You don't have to tell her.

479
00:44:08.705 --> 00:44:12.167
Oh, really? So we're keeping secrets
from your mom now?


480
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.212
Is that it? Secrets from Mommy?
I don't think so.


481
00:44:16.629 --> 00:44:18.548
Daddy, your hand.

482
00:44:21.467 --> 00:44:24.679
Okay, we can play the game.

483
00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:28.183
All right, but you have to promise me
you're not gonna tell anybody.


484
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:30.268
- I promise.
- Okay.


485
00:44:30.727 --> 00:44:32.353
I'll go turn it down.

486
00:44:46.034 --> 00:44:47.535
<i>Warning. Reducing gravity.</i>

487
00:44:47.702 --> 00:44:51.164
<i>All right, spaceship Sunshine
on the launching pad. Are you ready?</i>


488
00:44:51.498 --> 00:44:53.208
<i>- In five, four...</i>
- Yes, sir.


489
00:44:53.541 --> 00:44:56.669
<i>- ...three, two, one.</i>
- In three, two, one.


490
00:44:56.836 --> 00:44:58.505
Blast off!

491
00:45:08.848 --> 00:45:09.891
Look at that!

492
00:45:25.198 --> 00:45:26.574
That's good.

493
00:45:31.913 --> 00:45:33.122
You're amazing.

494
00:46:24.799 --> 00:46:30.346
- What are you doing?
- Hey. This plant needs to be pruned...


495
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.850
...in order to grow right.

496
00:46:34.017 --> 00:46:36.811
So, I was... It's looking good.

497
00:46:38.188 --> 00:46:41.691
So why are you growing this plant?
Just out of curiosity.


498
00:46:41.858 --> 00:46:44.152
Oh, it's a hobby.

499
00:46:46.446 --> 00:46:47.864
I did a scan on it.

500
00:46:48.198 --> 00:46:51.409
I hope you don't mind.
Just to see what its components were.


501
00:46:51.701 --> 00:46:55.163
Its chemical name is
delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol.


502
00:46:56.372 --> 00:47:00.710
I... That... It needs to be...
There's medicine... Medicinal purposes.


503
00:47:00.877 --> 00:47:04.714
And because it's in the flowering stage,
you'll find it would grow a lot better...


504
00:47:04.881 --> 00:47:07.842
...if you reduce the humidity
by watering it only once a day...


505
00:47:08.009 --> 00:47:10.512
...with the lights on
for only half the day.

506
00:47:16.017 --> 00:47:19.854
<i>Engine powering up.
Engine powering down.</i>


507
00:47:20.021 --> 00:47:22.816
<i>Engine... Engine powering down.</i>

508
00:47:23.316 --> 00:47:27.153
<i>Engine powering up.
Engine powering down.</i>


509
00:47:32.826 --> 00:47:34.828
Entire ship doesn't even get that...

510
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.081
What it was even... Meant for it.

511
00:47:38.248 --> 00:47:42.544
And no one...
But that's what makes it so wonderful.


512
00:47:44.337 --> 00:47:45.588
Turn around!

513
00:47:45.755 --> 00:47:47.841
It's not even that big of a deal.

514
00:47:50.176 --> 00:47:52.053
It shouldn't even be.

515
00:47:53.388 --> 00:47:56.933
Let's not even try for it.

516
00:47:58.351 --> 00:48:02.021
Consider it part
of the scientific observational process.


517
00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:03.773
No, no it...

518
00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:09.863
It's important for you to understand
its effects on humans.


519
00:48:10.029 --> 00:48:11.698
You're bad.

520
00:48:15.118 --> 00:48:18.121
Just inhale it. There you go.

521
00:48:22.083 --> 00:48:23.168
Yeah.

522
00:48:39.976 --> 00:48:43.146
Come on. Come on. Come on.

523
00:48:50.904 --> 00:48:53.323
- Good day. Yes.
- Good day, sir.


524
00:49:14.344 --> 00:49:15.720
What did I forget?

525
00:49:16.137 --> 00:49:19.682
My folders. My folders.

526
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.983
What do you got there?

527
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:32.445
Nothing.

528
00:49:32.987 --> 00:49:34.697
Show me what's in your hand.

529
00:49:38.493 --> 00:49:40.870
Sunshine, what are you doing?

530
00:49:41.538 --> 00:49:44.999
It's the last one. 
I'm setting it free.

531
00:49:46.209 --> 00:49:48.878
- Sunshine.
- It can live here.


532
00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:54.717
No, it can't live here
because it needs its mother.


533
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:58.179
No, she'll eat it. 
She ate the others.

534
00:49:58.346 --> 00:50:00.890
And if I leave
it there, she'll eat it.

535
00:50:01.766 --> 00:50:06.521
It can't live without its mom.

536
00:50:06.855 --> 00:50:10.108
It can't live on its own.

537
00:50:10.275 --> 00:50:12.360
Then why does she kill it?

538
00:50:12.777 --> 00:50:14.445
Sometimes mommy gerbils...

539
00:50:15.238 --> 00:50:18.074
...they worry so much
about their babies...


540
00:50:20.994 --> 00:50:24.622
...that they would kill it before they would
see anything bad happen to it.


541
00:50:26.457 --> 00:50:29.669
Well, then you'll be his mommy.

542
00:50:30.712 --> 00:50:32.005
Please?

543
00:50:34.215 --> 00:50:35.216
Okay.

544
00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.973
- Gently.
- It'll grow up in here.


545
00:50:42.724 --> 00:50:45.727
And when it's big enough,
we can put it back with its mommy.


546
00:50:47.854 --> 00:50:49.856
And she'll be so happy.

547
00:50:54.027 --> 00:50:56.112
Well, she ate the whole thing this time.

548
00:50:56.946 --> 00:50:59.491
No, Jessica's taking care of it.

549
00:51:02.118 --> 00:51:04.704
It seems like Jessica
is really reaching out to you.


550
00:51:04.871 --> 00:51:06.873
I guess you could say that.

551
00:51:08.166 --> 00:51:09.709
Do you like her?

552
00:51:09.876 --> 00:51:12.295
- She's okay. How about you?
- Not really.


553
00:51:12.879 --> 00:51:17.008
No, I just think she seems
really manipulative.


554
00:51:17.425 --> 00:51:19.469
- Do you know what that means?
- No.


555
00:51:19.636 --> 00:51:21.137
It means she's a bad person.

556
00:51:21.304 --> 00:51:27.185
I feel like she's just a little bit jealous of me
because I have you.


557
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:31.314
- Do you pick up on that?
- I guess so.


558
00:51:33.191 --> 00:51:35.735
I know you don't like her
because she's jealous...


559
00:51:35.902 --> 00:51:39.072
...but I do like her
because she's really nice to me.


560
00:51:39.239 --> 00:51:42.450
No, she's not nice to you.
What has she done that's nice?


561
00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:46.371
I've never had any friends before.

562
00:51:49.374 --> 00:51:51.000
That's not true.

563
00:51:53.044 --> 00:51:54.879
I'm your best friend.

564
00:51:55.046 --> 00:51:58.007
I know, but besides you and Dad
and the captain.


565
00:52:00.552 --> 00:52:02.262
Okay. Hey.

566
00:52:02.512 --> 00:52:04.013
Come here, sweetie pie.

567
00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:07.016
Don't you think it's
a little sad, really, that...

568
00:52:07.225 --> 00:52:12.021
...a woman as old as she is is trying
to be your friend?


569
00:52:12.188 --> 00:52:15.900
It's creepy, almost.

570
00:52:16.067 --> 00:52:17.443
Why would you think that?

571
00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:22.115
Well, it's just I think she seems like
a lonely, jealous, and manipulative person.


572
00:52:22.323 --> 00:52:25.326
You know, I walked into the bridge
the other night and...


573
00:52:25.577 --> 00:52:27.871
God, you wouldn't believe
what she was doing.


574
00:52:28.037 --> 00:52:30.206
- What did she do?
- Well...


575
00:52:31.749 --> 00:52:33.877
She stole some food.

576
00:52:34.294 --> 00:52:40.592
Yeah, I think she's got some real issues
with food and... Gosh, I wasn't gonna...


577
00:52:40.925 --> 00:52:45.930
...say anything, but actually,
it was your special sundae.


578
00:52:46.848 --> 00:52:50.894
Yeah, I mean, she didn't even care
that it was your special dessert.


579
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.397
She just went ahead and ate it anyway.

580
00:52:54.564 --> 00:52:55.982
It's just a sundae.

581
00:53:01.654 --> 00:53:03.448
Whose side are you on?

582
00:53:27.722 --> 00:53:29.015
He is relentless.

583
00:53:30.099 --> 00:53:32.352
- Jealous?
- You bet.


584
00:53:34.562 --> 00:53:36.981
- Some wine?
- No thanks.


585
00:53:46.908 --> 00:53:48.910
Good news.

586
00:53:49.536 --> 00:53:52.914
We are leaving in two weeks
for Starship 8.


587
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:59.170
That's right. He's gonna be overseeing
all of the docking bays.


588
00:53:59.337 --> 00:54:01.089
Oh, no, you lucky devil.

589
00:54:01.339 --> 00:54:03.466
That's great. Steve, that's great.

590
00:54:03.633 --> 00:54:05.009
Thanks, Ted.

591
00:54:06.094 --> 00:54:09.180
It is an incredible ship.
Real exclusive, if you know what I mean.


592
00:54:09.347 --> 00:54:11.474
It's not a military ship so it's...

593
00:54:11.641 --> 00:54:14.519
...only available to people
who can afford it, right?


594
00:54:14.686 --> 00:54:18.731
And they have a mall.
A goddamn mall. Can you believe that?


595
00:54:19.065 --> 00:54:22.235
Four stories of consumer goods.
I'm so excited.


596
00:54:22.402 --> 00:54:25.572
Lingerie, shoes, bags,
leather goods, dresses...


597
00:54:30.118 --> 00:54:33.121
I'm just going through a lot
of fucked-up stuff right now.


598
00:54:33.288 --> 00:54:36.833
I'm having a hard time applying everything
we've talked about.


599
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.921
My husband just keeps coming at me
with his need, need, need.


600
00:54:42.088 --> 00:54:45.717
And I hate the whole fucking vibe
on this ship, and it's pissing me off!


601
00:54:45.884 --> 00:54:49.929
<i>I'm going to up your dosage of Valium
to as much as you'd like.</i>


602
00:54:51.639 --> 00:54:54.684
Yeah. That'll be good.

603
00:54:55.018 --> 00:54:58.521
<i>You have one child.
How is your one child?</i>


604
00:55:00.523 --> 00:55:05.361
You know, I just can't be everything
to everyone all the time.


605
00:55:05.528 --> 00:55:10.283
<i>You can't be everything to everyone
until you are something to yourself.</i>


606
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.204
<i>Do you, Misty,
feel like you are something to yourself?</i>


607
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:15.747
I don't know.

608
00:55:18.708 --> 00:55:22.045
I've just been really trying
to get to know Misty.


609
00:55:22.504 --> 00:55:24.464
<i>What makes Misty happy?</i>

610
00:55:27.717 --> 00:55:29.761
What makes me happy?

611
00:55:29.928 --> 00:55:32.222
<i>What makes Misty okay?</i>

612
00:55:37.227 --> 00:55:38.603
Dr. Bot.

613
00:55:41.231 --> 00:55:42.857
Dr. Bot makes me okay.

614
00:55:43.024 --> 00:55:45.860
<i>Warning. Dr. Bot must remind Misty
not to become...</i>


615
00:55:46.027 --> 00:55:49.280
<i>- ...too close to her therapist bot.</i>
- I've gotta be close to somebody.


616
00:55:49.447 --> 00:55:51.991
<i>- We must keep this professional.</i>
- Don't be so cold.


617
00:55:52.158 --> 00:55:54.158
- <i>I must maintain objectivity.</i>
- But I feel like...


618
00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.623
I just feel like you and I have really
been going through it here, you know?


619
00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.376
I feel like I have really been
connecting with you.


620
00:56:01.543 --> 00:56:03.086
- You know me.<i>
- Emotion overload.</i>

621
00:56:03.253 --> 00:56:05.463
I tell you... I just... Stop it!

622
00:56:19.769 --> 00:56:23.773
Anyway, as I was saying...

623
00:56:25.692 --> 00:56:28.862
...I really care about you...

624
00:56:29.863 --> 00:56:33.825
...and I know you care about me.

625
00:56:44.878 --> 00:56:45.920
Hey.

626
00:56:46.462 --> 00:56:49.174
- Clearly, you didn't hear me, Disco Dan.
- What's up?


627
00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.176
This is how we're doing things,
leaving the...


628
00:56:51.342 --> 00:56:53.928
- ...compression valve open while we weld?
- No. No.


629
00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:56.097
Because if it is, fine.
I just need to know.


630
00:56:56.681 --> 00:57:00.059
- You got it.
- Make sure that I'm clear with everything.


631
00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:04.981
I need you to check humidity levels. It's
feeling a little humid to me, on the bridge.


632
00:57:06.441 --> 00:57:09.444
Okay, well, let me just quickly finish up
with these tanks.


633
00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:13.198
- I'll get to those levels for you.
- I don't need to remind you what happens...


634
00:57:13.364 --> 00:57:15.658
...when moisture gets
into the current conductor.


635
00:57:15.825 --> 00:57:18.953
I have 120 tanks left to seal
before we enter Zone Alpha.


636
00:57:19.287 --> 00:57:21.247
I'll have to work through the night.

637
00:57:21.414 --> 00:57:24.167
You wrote me up, now you want me
to go do maintenance work.


638
00:57:24.334 --> 00:57:25.752
What do you want me to do?

639
00:57:25.919 --> 00:57:30.215
I just think that you should be able
to prioritize within your own job.


640
00:57:30.381 --> 00:57:33.676
That's what I'm looking for, Ted.
Good critical-thinking skills.


641
00:57:33.843 --> 00:57:36.387
- That's what impresses me.
- Yeah.


642
00:57:36.554 --> 00:57:41.059
Yeah, so I guess it was Daniel's genius
critical-thinking skills...


643
00:57:41.226 --> 00:57:44.020
- ...that got him promoted
- What does Daniel have to do...?


644
00:57:44.187 --> 00:57:46.356
...in one tenth the time
I've been working here.


645
00:57:46.523 --> 00:57:50.485
Please excuse me, if I have to say I don't
appreciate I had to hear from Jessica...


646
00:57:50.652 --> 00:57:52.362
What? What did Jessica say?

647
00:57:52.529 --> 00:57:56.324
That Daniel's been promoted, when you
told me it was a family emergency.


648
00:57:56.491 --> 00:57:58.576
I need you to
understand I have a family...

649
00:57:58.743 --> 00:58:00.745
...and I've been working my ass off
down here.


650
00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:03.373
Ted, will you just listen to me?

651
00:58:04.249 --> 00:58:07.335
Daniel's mother has got lupus.

652
00:58:11.172 --> 00:58:12.590
Lupus.

653
00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:15.009
And that's why he had to go.

654
00:58:16.553 --> 00:58:17.971
Because of the lupus.

655
00:58:18.304 --> 00:58:21.683
This is what I'm talking about!
This is why I'm not admiral yet!


656
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:27.397
How am I supposed to soar with the eagles
when I'm down here talking to turkeys!


657
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.202
Hello.

658
00:58:41.995 --> 00:58:44.122
- Miss Marlowe, I'm guessing.
- Yes, thank God.


659
00:58:44.289 --> 00:58:46.541
I thought it'd be late.
It's a Christmas surprise.


660
00:58:46.708 --> 00:58:47.834
Terrific.

661
00:58:48.042 --> 00:58:49.377
Oh, thank you.

662
00:58:50.044 --> 00:58:51.504
Thought you'd have a larger ship.

663
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:54.382
- I can't fit my belongings...
- We'll get your stuff there...


664
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:57.051
- ...before you arrive. Don't you worry.
- Oh, captain.


665
00:59:00.138 --> 00:59:01.264
Yes.

666
00:59:01.431 --> 00:59:04.309
May I have a word with you? Hold on.
Steve's mother...


667
00:59:04.476 --> 00:59:07.270
- ...is in the hibernation chamber.
- No kidding.


668
00:59:07.437 --> 00:59:10.117
She wanted her body in suspended
animation until we reached Orion...


669
00:59:10.273 --> 00:59:13.234
- ...and she could get that tumor removed.
- Yes.


670
00:59:13.401 --> 00:59:16.237
Great. So, do I have to wake her
before we move her to the new ship?


671
00:59:16.404 --> 00:59:18.823
Given that she's in hibernation,
do I really have to...


672
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:21.784
...ask her permission?
I'd hate to bother her. Plus...


673
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:25.079
...she is so slow-moving. It would
be so much less of a headache...


674
00:59:25.246 --> 00:59:27.957
...if we could ship her in her storage unit
with our stuff.


675
00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:31.669
- No problem.
- Oh, fantastic.


676
00:59:36.174 --> 00:59:40.595
You know, if it helps, my grandmother
was in hibernation for five years.


677
00:59:40.762 --> 00:59:42.055
It doesn't.

678
00:59:44.766 --> 00:59:47.101
I realize that I should've checked
with you first.


679
00:59:47.268 --> 00:59:48.269
Yeah.

680
00:59:48.436 --> 00:59:52.357
- If it's a matter of care, I'd be happy to...
- I'm allergic.


681
00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:53.858
So...

682
00:59:54.025 --> 00:59:56.277
I just thought
because of the gerbils that...


683
00:59:56.444 --> 01:00:00.740
Gerbils don't jump up on your lap
or leave hair all over the place.


684
01:00:00.907 --> 01:00:03.409
Could we not mention this to Sunshine?

685
01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:06.746
Just keep it between us?

686
01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:09.249
Sure.

687
01:00:29.686 --> 01:00:30.687
Hey.

688
01:00:33.189 --> 01:00:36.067
- What are you watching?
- Home movies.


689
01:00:39.237 --> 01:00:40.363
Yeah.

690
01:01:10.059 --> 01:01:11.978
Well, I don't care. I'm offended.

691
01:01:12.145 --> 01:01:14.785
They're having a Christmas party,
otherwise they'd have one for us.


692
01:01:14.814 --> 01:01:16.357
- This one?
- Fragile.


693
01:01:16.524 --> 01:01:19.402
It just pisses me off.
When Charlotte and Stan left the ship...


694
01:01:19.569 --> 01:01:21.863
...I threw them a huge
going-away party, right?


695
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:23.948
Birthdays, anniversaries,
I'm the one...


696
01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:27.535
...putting the whole goddamn thing
together. I am done. Forget it.


697
01:01:27.702 --> 01:01:30.205
On the new ship,
I am not lifting a finger for anyone.


698
01:01:30.371 --> 01:01:32.123
Good. You shouldn't have to.

699
01:01:32.457 --> 01:01:35.668
Thank you so much for helping me
with this. I really appreciate it.


700
01:01:35.835 --> 01:01:38.963
You can't imagine the pod this guy brings.
I had to cram everything in.


701
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.925
There's no straps or protections
for the breakables.


702
01:01:42.091 --> 01:01:45.094
No, no, hold on a second.
Take this instead.


703
01:01:46.888 --> 01:01:49.182
- Thank you.
- His mother.


704
01:01:50.975 --> 01:01:52.435
She looks nice.

705
01:01:53.061 --> 01:01:54.771
When she's asleep.

706
01:01:57.065 --> 01:01:58.483
Steve!

707
01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:02.904
What?

708
01:02:03.071 --> 01:02:05.532
Honey, there's no room.
We can't fit her.


709
01:02:05.698 --> 01:02:07.784
- We'll make room.
- There's no room, honey.


710
01:02:07.951 --> 01:02:10.995
She's gonna have to come later
with your sports equipment.


711
01:02:14.874 --> 01:02:16.000
Darn.

712
01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:27.095
Would you mind terribly
taking care of all that?


713
01:02:27.846 --> 01:02:28.972
Of...

714
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:32.809
Yeah, sure.
I mean, that would be my pleasure.


715
01:02:33.226 --> 01:02:34.435
No rush.

716
01:02:36.437 --> 01:02:40.024
Okay, now what can I get you
for dessert?


717
01:02:40.525 --> 01:02:42.986
- Sundae!
- Sundae! Okay.


718
01:02:43.153 --> 01:02:46.239
<i>Activating food service.
You have chosen take out.</i>


719
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:48.491
<i>Sundae.</i>

720
01:02:50.869 --> 01:02:52.537
Somebody ate them all again.

721
01:02:53.997 --> 01:02:56.374
How about I get you some rice pudding?

722
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.335
Oh, let me check the freezer unit.

723
01:02:59.502 --> 01:03:02.088
Maybe there's an extra one
hiding in here.


724
01:03:03.089 --> 01:03:06.134
- Okay, let's see.
- What's that?


725
01:03:08.553 --> 01:03:12.015
Oh, darn. I was hiding it from you.

726
01:03:19.481 --> 01:03:22.108
Okay. Promise you won't tell anyone.

727
01:03:23.276 --> 01:03:25.612
I got this for you for Christmas.

728
01:03:31.618 --> 01:03:35.121
But Jessica says she's allergic...

729
01:03:36.206 --> 01:03:38.875
...and can't have puppies
running all over the ship.


730
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:54.849
Excuse me, sir.

731
01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.436
I was hoping that we could
discuss Daniel's chart.


732
01:03:58.603 --> 01:04:00.021
You gotta help me out here.

733
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:04.192
I don't know how they talk to their
superiors on space station Lorelei...


734
01:04:04.359 --> 01:04:07.237
Space station Lorelei sir,
is an impeccable place.


735
01:04:07.403 --> 01:04:09.864
- We were competent, we were efficient...
- Yeah, I know.


736
01:04:10.031 --> 01:04:12.242
I've read all the records.
It's not the point.


737
01:04:12.408 --> 01:04:16.120
Well, then you know that I am more
than qualified for this job.


738
01:04:16.287 --> 01:04:19.666
I'm simply saying that if we have
these graphs in front of us...


739
01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:23.044
...we might as well use them.
I mean, I don't understand.


740
01:04:23.211 --> 01:04:25.004
To ignore them is...

741
01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.216
Sir, Daniel clearly spent a better part...

742
01:04:28.383 --> 01:04:30.718
...of his tenure here working on these.

743
01:04:31.553 --> 01:04:33.179
Sir, did you not respect Daniel?

744
01:04:35.014 --> 01:04:36.224
Did you not like him?

745
01:04:42.522 --> 01:04:45.567
Sir, why did Daniel leave?

746
01:04:51.948 --> 01:04:55.910
- What did I tell you?
- Well, you said that he was promoted.


747
01:04:56.578 --> 01:05:00.039
Exactly. Exactly. He was promoted.
All right, you know what?


748
01:05:00.206 --> 01:05:03.042
I want to settle this once and for all.
There seems to be...


749
01:05:03.209 --> 01:05:07.088
- ...a little confusion about this Daniel thing.
- That's really not necessary.


750
01:05:07.255 --> 01:05:09.799
Attention all crew members.
Hear ye, hear ye.


751
01:05:10.133 --> 01:05:15.180
Regarding Daniel's departure, which there
seems to be a lot of confusion about.


752
01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:19.309
I want to tell you this once and for all,
Daniel was promoted.


753
01:05:21.019 --> 01:05:22.103
Okay?

754
01:05:23.688 --> 01:05:25.565
Yeah, and also, 
I am given to believe...

755
01:05:25.732 --> 01:05:27.692
...there was some family emergency
as well.


756
01:05:27.859 --> 01:05:30.528
So there you have
it in black and white.

757
01:05:31.529 --> 01:05:32.655
Case closed.

758
01:05:54.511 --> 01:05:58.640
<i>Warning, airborne chemical detected
in tank storage three.</i>


759
01:05:58.807 --> 01:06:00.391
<i>Now ventilating.</i>

760
01:06:12.862 --> 01:06:16.366
Hey, Sunshine. 
What are you up to?

761
01:06:17.325 --> 01:06:20.245
Just talking to my mom
about different things.


762
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:23.414
It's not about you.
It's about someone else.


763
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:29.212
I have a little bit of free time
if you want to go the arboretum with me.


764
01:06:31.422 --> 01:06:32.757
No thanks.

765
01:06:32.924 --> 01:06:37.303
We could look at the bonsai tree
like you like to do. You don't want to go?


766
01:06:43.184 --> 01:06:46.229
Well, is it just
that you don't want to go...


767
01:06:46.396 --> 01:06:48.148
...or you don't want to go with me?

768
01:06:48.314 --> 01:06:51.651
It's just because I don't want to go,
for some reason.


769
01:06:51.818 --> 01:06:54.821
I don't know why,
but I just don't really want to.


770
01:06:58.324 --> 01:07:00.535
Okay. I understand.

771
01:07:02.954 --> 01:07:05.373
Listen, it was really cool talking to you.

772
01:07:45.622 --> 01:07:49.876
<i>Attention crew, don't forget to vote
for the new cafeteria wallpaper.</i>


773
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:53.171
<i>Decision will be final at 1200 hours.</i>

774
01:08:13.399 --> 01:08:15.276
Very... That's very good.

775
01:08:15.735 --> 01:08:17.153
I'm a little busy right now.

776
01:08:17.946 --> 01:08:20.156
Please don't inhibit her creativity.

777
01:08:24.661 --> 01:08:26.913
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!


778
01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:28.540
Okay. Come on.

779
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.801
Hologram chamber on.

780
01:09:30.518 --> 01:09:33.688
<i>Hold on one second.
Let me come out. Sorry.</i>


781
01:09:35.315 --> 01:09:38.067
<i>I've... Glenn?</i>

782
01:09:38.443 --> 01:09:42.280
Daniel. This is a bad time.

783
01:09:42.447 --> 01:09:44.991
You know, I could hologram later.
I'm sorry.


784
01:09:45.408 --> 01:09:46.701
<i>What is it, Glenn?</i>

785
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.831
You look good. How are you?

786
01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.752
- I'm great.
- You look great.


787
01:09:56.711 --> 01:09:59.172
So you're on the Nostradamus now.

788
01:09:59.589 --> 01:10:01.716
<i>Yep. You found me.</i>

789
01:10:02.383 --> 01:10:04.594
I guess you got that promotion.

790
01:10:04.761 --> 01:10:08.473
<i>Yes, incredibly.
Considering what happened.</i>


791
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.683
Right. Anyway...

792
01:10:10.975 --> 01:10:14.813
<i>Also serving under Lawrence Wilson.
Fantastic leader.</i>


793
01:10:14.979 --> 01:10:17.065
<i>- Total role model.</i>
- Wait.


794
01:10:17.232 --> 01:10:20.527
Larry Wilson is the captain of
the<i>Nostradamus?</i> You gotta be kidding me.

795
01:10:20.693 --> 01:10:22.195
<i>He's actually an admiral now...</i>

796
01:10:22.362 --> 01:10:24.864
- Yeah.<i>- ...and I believe he prefers "Lawrence."</i>

797
01:10:25.031 --> 01:10:28.868
Well, I mean, you know,
I've known him for years as Larry so...


798
01:10:29.035 --> 01:10:30.829
I know that one very well.

799
01:10:30.995 --> 01:10:33.540
Not like that. 
I don't know him that well.

800
01:10:33.706 --> 01:10:36.584
<i>Oh my God,
it's okay to know a man well, Glenn.</i>


801
01:10:37.877 --> 01:10:40.046
Reason for calling,
besides saying hi...


802
01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.758
...I just want to know if you happened
to get this notice. What was it?


803
01:10:43.925 --> 01:10:47.971
Yeah, "You are required to report
to 20 hours of therapy."


804
01:10:48.304 --> 01:10:50.390
I mean, over your little AWOL episode.

805
01:10:50.557 --> 01:10:52.684
Did you happen to get this too?
This one?


806
01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:56.062
<i>My little episode?
My little episode, Glenn?</i>


807
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:58.314
Well, Daniel, you are the one that left.

808
01:10:58.481 --> 01:11:00.775
<i>I left because you had to be drunk
to make love to me...</i>


809
01:11:00.942 --> 01:11:03.069
<i>...then you sobbed
in your pillow afterwards.</i>


810
01:11:03.236 --> 01:11:06.114
I want to remind you
that you have to be very careful...


811
01:11:06.447 --> 01:11:08.741
...about the way you talk
about these things...


812
01:11:09.033 --> 01:11:12.036
...especially in therapy because that...

813
01:11:13.079 --> 01:11:15.331
- It's very delicate... <i>
- Aye-aye, Sir.</i>

814
01:11:15.498 --> 01:11:18.501
And careers can be affected.

815
01:11:19.878 --> 01:11:21.171
Just...

816
01:11:23.214 --> 01:11:24.507
What? Is someone with you?

817
01:11:24.674 --> 01:11:27.302
<i>- No, no, no. I need to go.</i>
- Was he there the whole time?


818
01:11:27.468 --> 01:11:30.930
<i>- You don't have to worry about...</i>
- Who? Who was it? Was it Larry?


819
01:11:31.097 --> 01:11:32.515
<i>Bye, Glenn.</i>

820
01:11:32.682 --> 01:11:35.143
<i>- End of tape.
- End of what?</i>


821
01:11:35.727 --> 01:11:37.979
- Nothing. Nothing.
- <i>Were you recording this?</i>


822
01:11:38.688 --> 01:11:40.899
<i>You sad, pathetic...</i>

823
01:11:56.956 --> 01:11:59.709
- Hey.
- Hi.


824
01:12:01.544 --> 01:12:03.171
I got your message. What...?

825
01:12:04.839 --> 01:12:07.967
- I really need...
- Oh, God.


826
01:12:08.134 --> 01:12:10.762
Are you okay? Here, sit down. Sit down.

827
01:12:11.513 --> 01:12:13.932
Okay. Okay.

828
01:12:15.558 --> 01:12:17.602
- Sorry it's so late.
- No.


829
01:12:17.769 --> 01:12:21.898
I just...
I needed to talk to someone.


830
01:12:22.065 --> 01:12:23.066
Yeah.

831
01:12:25.527 --> 01:12:26.861
Do you ever...?

832
01:12:27.904 --> 01:12:31.699
Do you ever feel like you're
just floating around in space...


833
01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:36.162
...and there's no one there?
I mean, no one there to check you or...


834
01:12:36.704 --> 01:12:40.875
I don't know.
I mean, there's no family or friends or...


835
01:12:41.668 --> 01:12:46.548
I don't know. Do you ever feel crazy?

836
01:12:58.935 --> 01:13:01.646
<i>- Glenn?
- Daniel. Sorry.</i>


837
01:13:03.231 --> 01:13:05.567
<i>- No, no, no, I need to go.
- Was he there the whole time?</i>


838
01:13:05.733 --> 01:13:07.360
<i>You don't have to worry about...</i>

839
01:13:07.777 --> 01:13:09.529
<i>Well, Daniel, you are the one that left.</i>

840
01:13:09.696 --> 01:13:12.073
<i>I left because you had to be stinking drunk
to make love to me...</i>


841
01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.992
<i>...then you sobbed in your pillow...</i>

842
01:13:14.367 --> 01:13:16.119
<i>To make love to me, and then you...</i>

843
01:13:16.411 --> 01:13:18.037
<i>To make love to me...</i>

844
01:13:19.706 --> 01:13:23.835
- I feel like we have so much in common.
- I do too.


845
01:13:26.171 --> 01:13:31.050
I mean,
we're both these fractured people.


846
01:13:31.217 --> 01:13:33.761
You lost your hand in battle and I...

847
01:13:34.596 --> 01:13:36.556
- I am...
I have a... I...


848
01:13:36.806 --> 01:13:38.308
Yeah I am...

849
01:13:39.851 --> 01:13:41.352
I didn't...

850
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:46.191
I didn't lose my hand in battle.

851
01:13:48.234 --> 01:13:52.822
I shot it off while cleaning a laser-refractor
piston my first week of service.


852
01:13:56.659 --> 01:13:57.785
So...

853
01:14:04.667 --> 01:14:06.211
I don't care.

854
01:14:08.004 --> 01:14:09.672
I understand.

855
01:14:15.887 --> 01:14:16.888
I...

856
01:14:33.863 --> 01:14:35.323
- Sorry. Okay, let me...
- Ted.


857
01:14:35.657 --> 01:14:38.159
- No, I have to... It's okay. Stay still.
- That hurts.


858
01:14:38.326 --> 01:14:40.829
- Ted, make... Make it stop!
- I'm sorry. Oh, God.


859
01:14:40.995 --> 01:14:44.374
- Get it off! Get it off!
- No, if I get it... You have to...


860
01:14:44.541 --> 01:14:46.543
Stop. Darn it!

861
01:14:47.126 --> 01:14:49.963
You had to... Yeah, do it like this.

862
01:14:50.129 --> 01:14:52.882
Oh, God. I'm... I am...

863
01:14:53.049 --> 01:14:56.052
- Okay, well, I mean...
- My hand just... You know...


864
01:14:56.219 --> 01:14:57.887
- It was my fault.
- No, no, it wasn't.


865
01:14:58.054 --> 01:14:59.889
- It was my hand.
- No, no.


866
01:15:00.473 --> 01:15:02.892
- Just got a little...
- I turned it on.


867
01:15:05.186 --> 01:15:07.230
- I think I should go now.
- What?


868
01:15:07.397 --> 01:15:10.358
No, we... Can we...?

<i>Welcome Lieutenant Glenn Terry.</i>

895
01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:53.503
- Actually, it's "captain" now.
- <i>Updating file.</i>


896
01:16:55.964 --> 01:16:58.424
<i>Welcome, Captain Glenn Terry.</i>

897
01:16:58.591 --> 01:17:01.886
<i>Shall we take a voyage
of discovery together?</i>


898
01:17:03.763 --> 01:17:05.181
Why not?

899
01:17:05.348 --> 01:17:07.684
<i>What problems inside
of Captain Glenn...</i>


900
01:17:07.851 --> 01:17:10.270
<i>...would Captain Glenn
like to work on?</i>


901
01:17:10.436 --> 01:17:15.441
Just for the record,
I have no problems inside of me at all.


902
01:17:15.733 --> 01:17:18.027
And this is new for me. 
This was not...

903
01:17:18.361 --> 01:17:22.448
<i>Being open to change is the first step
on the road to mental health.</i>


904
01:17:24.409 --> 01:17:27.829
I just need you people to know
that I'm not being hesitant.


905
01:17:27.996 --> 01:17:31.124
<i>Hesitation often leads to revelation.</i>

906
01:17:31.791 --> 01:17:34.294
- Duly noted.
- <i>I have noted it as well.</i>


907
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.714
That would be the "duly" part.
That's the two of us.


908
01:17:38.548 --> 01:17:39.549
<i>Correct.</i>

909
01:17:42.051 --> 01:17:44.721
<i>What are you thinking
in the midst of this silence?</i>


910
01:17:45.638 --> 01:17:47.474
Actually, I was thinking about smoking.

911
01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.517
<i>Cigarettes contain carcinogens
which may...</i>


912
01:17:49.684 --> 01:17:52.187
<i>...cause cancer
in carbon-based life forms.</i>


913
01:17:52.353 --> 01:17:54.355
- Right.<i>
- You are a carbon-based life form...</i>

914
01:17:54.522 --> 01:17:56.858
<i>...therefore, cigarettes may cause
cancer inside you.</i>


915
01:17:57.025 --> 01:17:58.610
- Thank you.<i>
- You're welcome.</i>

916
01:17:58.776 --> 01:18:01.362
Can I smoke?
May I smoke here, please?


917
01:18:01.529 --> 01:18:03.281
<i>Perhaps you'd like to try Valium?</i>

918
01:18:03.448 --> 01:18:05.533
Smoking is kind of my Valium,
so honest...


919
01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.702
<i>They are two entirely different drugs.</i>

920
01:18:07.869 --> 01:18:10.914
<i>Nicotine is a stimulant.
Valium is a sedative.</i>


921
01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.500
- Is it?<i>
- Yes, it is.</i>

922
01:18:13.666 --> 01:18:15.668
I was not aware of that.

923
01:18:18.796 --> 01:18:22.884
<i>Captain Glenn, how have things been
on the ship for you?</i>


924
01:18:23.885 --> 01:18:25.512
Status quo.

925
01:18:27.847 --> 01:18:31.851
We're having a Christmas party
for the people on the ship.


926
01:18:32.018 --> 01:18:35.188
<i>Dr. Bot politely declines your invitation.</i>

927
01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:39.108
It's humans only,
so that's really a non-issue. Okay?


928
01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.862
Anyway...

929
01:18:44.864 --> 01:18:49.536
...I'm supposed to be pretending
that these people are my friends when...


930
01:18:49.702 --> 01:18:51.955
<i>You have to be a friend
to have a friend.</i>


931
01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:57.043
- They're not friends. 
They are colleagues.<i>
- A friend in need is a friend indeed.</i>

932
01:19:00.129 --> 01:19:02.215
- Friend.<i>
- Make new friends.</i>

933
01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:06.553
<i>Keep the old, for one is silver
while the other one is gold.</i>


934
01:19:08.721 --> 01:19:11.015
- Gold.<i>
- Remember the golden rule:</i>

935
01:19:11.182 --> 01:19:14.018
<i>"Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you."</i>


936
01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.023
- Silver.<i>
- Every cloud has a silver lining.</i>

937
01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.573
- Cigarette.<i>
- Cigarettes contain carcinogens...</i>

938
01:19:26.739 --> 01:19:29.284
<i>...which may cause cancer
in carbon-based life forms.</i>


939
01:19:29.617 --> 01:19:32.245
<i>You are a carbon-based life form,
therefore cigarettes...</i>


940
01:19:32.412 --> 01:19:34.706
<i>...may cause cancer inside you.</i>

941
01:20:08.948 --> 01:20:12.368
You're gonna make us late for the party.
Where were you?


942
01:20:12.869 --> 01:20:15.371
I was just finishing up some business.

943
01:20:16.581 --> 01:20:18.166
You ready?

944
01:20:25.924 --> 01:20:26.925
Yes.

945
01:20:44.108 --> 01:20:46.236
<i>Autopilot activated.</i>

946
01:20:53.201 --> 01:20:55.620
- Hey, there he is.
- Donna.


947
01:20:55.912 --> 01:20:57.622
Hi, Susan.

948
01:20:58.248 --> 01:21:01.042
Oh. I thought you'd left.

949
01:21:01.876 --> 01:21:03.878
Can't pass up a Christmas party.

950
01:21:05.129 --> 01:21:06.256
Well, enjoy.

951
01:21:11.803 --> 01:21:13.888
- Hey.
- Hi.


952
01:21:15.014 --> 01:21:17.600
- How are you?
- Good. How you doing?


953
01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:22.230
- Could I get you something, or...?
- I...


954
01:21:29.863 --> 01:21:31.990
- I will have another.
- All right.


955
01:21:32.157 --> 01:21:33.283
Thank you.

956
01:21:44.627 --> 01:21:46.713
- There's no cake.
- There's a cake.


957
01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.756
Yeah, it is a Christmas cake.

958
01:21:49.174 --> 01:21:50.675
Have a drink, Donna.

959
01:22:14.449 --> 01:22:16.659
- You know, my mom...
- My best... I'm sorry.


960
01:22:16.826 --> 01:22:18.786
- What were you saying?
- My mom always had...


961
01:22:18.953 --> 01:22:22.040
This is really boring.
Let's play a game.


962
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:25.877
I thought we left Sunshine
back in the capsule.


963
01:22:28.213 --> 01:22:29.881
Let's play a game. Come on.

964
01:22:30.048 --> 01:22:32.091
What kind of game
do you want to play?


965
01:22:32.258 --> 01:22:36.971
Okay, everybody goes around
and tells a secret.


966
01:22:37.138 --> 01:22:39.557
- I don't like secret games.
- I don't know about that.


967
01:22:39.724 --> 01:22:42.727
- Yeah, I don't really have any secrets.
- Oh, I have a secret.


968
01:22:42.894 --> 01:22:44.729
I'm gonna get a beer really quick.

969
01:22:44.896 --> 01:22:47.440
- Can you get me one too, please?
- Yeah.


970
01:22:48.858 --> 01:22:51.903
Oh, I want him to hear my secret.

971
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:54.864
Ted, come back here please.
We'd like to get this over with.


972
01:22:55.031 --> 01:22:57.492
- We're going.
- Oh, no, honey, come on.


973
01:22:57.659 --> 01:23:00.078
I wanna play.
I love games, but maybe charades.


974
01:23:00.245 --> 01:23:02.372
Something we can all play together.

975
01:23:02.539 --> 01:23:04.999
- I'm leaving. You coming?
- Honey, you're being silly.


976
01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:06.709
What's wrong, Steve?

977
01:23:10.088 --> 01:23:11.464
It's just a game.

978
01:23:16.094 --> 01:23:17.178
Okay.

979
01:23:21.099 --> 01:23:22.600
Okay.

980
01:23:22.892 --> 01:23:24.894
My secret is...

981
01:23:26.062 --> 01:23:29.983
...I have never had an orgasm.

982
01:23:32.694 --> 01:23:33.862
I don't think that...

983
01:23:34.028 --> 01:23:37.532
Well, yeah, that really is probably
more his secret.


984
01:23:40.368 --> 01:23:41.995
That's good. No...

985
01:23:42.412 --> 01:23:44.706
...that's a good one. That's... Yeah.

986
01:23:45.498 --> 01:23:50.044
- You know what, we shouldn't...
- No, it's okay. It's okay. Good game, Misty.


987
01:23:50.879 --> 01:23:53.381
Yeah, you got everybody
gathered around in here.


988
01:23:54.924 --> 01:23:57.802
Come on,
anything else you want to say to me?


989
01:24:01.347 --> 01:24:04.517
Look at me! Look at me, please.

990
01:24:05.185 --> 01:24:08.146
You got something you wanna say,
say it. I am ready to hear it.


991
01:24:09.022 --> 01:24:10.940
Ted, settle down.

992
01:24:21.201 --> 01:24:22.327
It's okay.

993
01:24:22.535 --> 01:24:24.204
She has a secret too.

994
01:24:24.829 --> 01:24:26.247
- Don't.
- Misty.


995
01:24:26.414 --> 01:24:28.875
Why don't you tell everyone
your secret.


996
01:24:31.044 --> 01:24:34.214
Look, let's not... Please, let's not play
this game anymore.


997
01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.299
- It's not funny.
- I know why you wanna stop.


998
01:24:36.466 --> 01:24:39.427
You know why? Because I don't like you.
That's my secret.


999
01:24:41.554 --> 01:24:43.681
That's not a secret.
I don't like you, either.


1000
01:24:43.848 --> 01:24:45.600
- Shut up, Misty.
- Ted, it's okay.


1001
01:24:45.767 --> 01:24:48.645
Now, Ted, honestly,
that is no way to talk to a lady.


1002
01:24:48.812 --> 01:24:51.189
- Yeah, you would know.
- Yes, I would.


1003
01:24:51.356 --> 01:24:53.149
- You would know. Yeah.
- Ted, Ted, Ted.


1004
01:24:53.316 --> 01:24:56.194
Does anybody ever wonder why
she always has to act like a man?


1005
01:24:56.361 --> 01:24:59.823
- Stop. Let's stop now...
- Why she's always up on the bridge...


1006
01:24:59.989 --> 01:25:01.533
- ...acting like a man.
- Stop.


1007
01:25:01.699 --> 01:25:03.201
I would like to know that.

1008
01:25:03.368 --> 01:25:06.454
Okay, Misty, drop this right now
because it's really not funny.


1009
01:25:06.621 --> 01:25:08.581
Maybe it's because...

1010
01:25:08.748 --> 01:25:10.542
- ...she's not a real woman.
- Misty.


1011
01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:13.002
Maybe she's not
a real woman because...


1012
01:25:13.169 --> 01:25:14.629
- ...she can't have...
- Stop it!


1013
01:25:14.796 --> 01:25:16.339
- Enough!
- Okay, just back off.


1014
01:25:16.506 --> 01:25:19.968
- You don't need to scream at her.
- Sir, this is none of your business.


1015
01:25:20.134 --> 01:25:23.555
It's none of my business?
I'm just the captain of the ship.


1016
01:25:23.721 --> 01:25:27.600
- It's none of my business. That's perfect!
- I understand...


1017
01:25:29.519 --> 01:25:34.315
I don't care if it's the main room,
main bridge, rec room...


1018
01:25:34.566 --> 01:25:36.901
...playroom, toilet room,
it's my business!


1019
01:25:37.068 --> 01:25:40.905
I don't care if it's irrigation duct
level fucking 7! It's my fucking business!


1020
01:25:41.072 --> 01:25:43.032
Your attitude
since you've shown up here...


1021
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:46.828
...has been to tell me what to do, how
to do it, with a chip on your shoulder!


1022
01:25:46.995 --> 01:25:49.831
- Why can't you just be a woman?
- Why can't you just be a man?


1023
01:25:52.208 --> 01:25:53.585
What does that mean?

1024
01:25:55.336 --> 01:25:58.631
Excuse me, forgive me, sir,
but you are the last person...


1025
01:25:58.965 --> 01:26:02.051
...I'd think would be demanding
we should stick to conventions.


1026
01:26:02.218 --> 01:26:04.888
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


1027
01:26:05.096 --> 01:26:09.309
Sir, you're gay!
You are a gay man and we all know it.


1028
01:26:11.895 --> 01:26:12.979
He's what?

1029
01:26:14.898 --> 01:26:18.735
<i>Sir, you're gay!
You are a gay man and we all know it.</i>


1030
01:26:20.195 --> 01:26:24.324
Now, how could...?
You can't know something...


1031
01:26:25.408 --> 01:26:28.203
You can't... Like that. That's...

1032
01:26:28.369 --> 01:26:31.748
Something like that is not...
It's not true. Daniel and I were never...


1033
01:26:31.915 --> 01:26:34.918
We are not together.
We weren't together. There's...


1034
01:26:35.919 --> 01:26:40.048
Ask him. He will tell you! I promise.

1035
01:26:51.184 --> 01:26:53.770
I only stay with you
because of Sunshine.


1036
01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.315
Do you know that?

1037
01:27:00.026 --> 01:27:01.277
Yeah.

1038
01:27:02.987 --> 01:27:04.864
I know that.

1039
01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:16.376
<i>Alert.</i>

1040
01:27:22.715 --> 01:27:24.509
