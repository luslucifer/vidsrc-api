1
00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.659
Cassie?

2
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11.799
What did I say about
needing more alone time?


3
00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:14.236
You need it right now?

4
00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:16.304
Please don't argue.

5
00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:21.243
Well, you could give me
some notice.


6
00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:26.748
Where's Cassie?
She's upstairs.


7
00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:28.750
Is she coming down?

8
00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:30.552
Not tonight. No.

9
00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:33.955
Cheers.

10
00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:43.698
What?

11
00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:49.971
You know that girl?

12
00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.039
I don't think so.

13
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:44.359
The Massachusetts state
driver's manual?


14
00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:47.362
I have my road test next week.

15
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:50.665
And it's making you cry?

16
00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:52.701
No.

17
00:02:57.574 --> 00:03:00.742
Sweetie, you're really
freaking me out lately.


18
00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:02.310
I know.

19
00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:08.516
I'm sorry that I'm so...

20
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:10.485
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.399
I'm gonna take out
the trash, okay?


22
00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:38.613
- Can I help you?
- Hi.


23
00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:40.181
Hi.

24
00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:44.753
Do you know...
You know who I am?


25
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:46.721
No.

26
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.790
No idea at all?

27
00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:52.861
- Should I?
- Sorry.


28
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.363
It's kinda weird.
I-I'm not a crazy person.


29
00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:58.165
I'm, uh...
Okay.


30
00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:02.737
Who are you?

31
00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:04.906
- Can I have a hug first?
- What?


32
00:04:04.974 --> 00:04:08.943
I'm sorry. I'm
really exhausted and nervous,


33
00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:12.313
and I... I really...
I need a hug.


34
00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:18.853
Thank you.
Uh-huh.


35
00:04:18.922 --> 00:04:20.422
Thank you.

36
00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:26.294
So?

37
00:04:26.362 --> 00:04:29.831
You're Davis Green.
Mm-hmm.


38
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.034
And I'm Alexis Green.

39
00:04:33.102 --> 00:04:36.170
And we're cousins.

40
00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:38.973
Oh. Uh...

41
00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:41.108
No, you have the wrong person.

42
00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:42.677
No.

43
00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:46.881
No, your dad is Ronald Green. He's
a developmental psychologist.


44
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.650
Yeah?
Yeah.


45
00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:50.518
And he doesn't have
any siblings.


46
00:04:50.587 --> 00:04:55.189
No, no. No, he does. He has
an older brother, my dad.


47
00:04:55.258 --> 00:04:59.360
And they just never, like, um...

48
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.999
You forgot the trash.

49
00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:07.368
Cassie, thi...

50
00:05:09.473 --> 00:05:12.373
Oh.

51
00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:14.509
Uh... Okay.

52
00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:16.778
I'm not who you're looking for.

53
00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:19.287
My dad doesn't have any siblings,
and I don't have any cousins,


54
00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.184
and we have the last name,
but it's pretty common, so...


55
00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:25.787
No, no.

56
00:05:25.856 --> 00:05:28.756
Please... Please leave.

57
00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:40.301
It was really nice
to meet you, Davis.


58
00:05:44.574 --> 00:05:48.075
Fuck!

59
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.241
I have to tell you something.

60
00:07:05.855 --> 00:07:08.623
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. You're very kind.


61
00:07:08.692 --> 00:07:12.126
I'm glad the applause sign is still
working.


62
00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:16.030
This is HD 115.

63
00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.432
Human Development.

64
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.969
If you're looking
for "Heavy Drinking 115,"


65
00:07:21.037 --> 00:07:24.005
it's across the quad,
down the block to Mulligan's.


66
00:07:25.642 --> 00:07:28.910
Human development.

67
00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:34.215
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a baby.


68
00:07:34.283 --> 00:07:37.018
One of the great mysteries
of life.


69
00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:41.455
Who is she?
What will she become?


70
00:07:41.524 --> 00:07:43.324
Will you be a painter?

71
00:07:43.392 --> 00:07:45.693
A head of state?

72
00:07:45.762 --> 00:07:48.429
A murderer?

73
00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:51.499
By the way you're looking at me
right now, I'm guessing the last.


74
00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:54.102
Thank you.

75
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.272
And is it inevitable...

76
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:00.474
What she will become?

77
00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:02.844
Is it predetermined?

78
00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:09.350
Or is someone, something out there
going to be transformative?


79
00:08:09.418 --> 00:08:11.886
Nature, nurture?

80
00:08:11.955 --> 00:08:14.956
That is the question.

81
00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:19.326
This class will bring us
to a closer understanding...


82
00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:23.131
that the question is bullshit.

83
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:27.735
The answer is
far more complex, subtle...


84
00:08:27.804 --> 00:08:31.238
than any black or white
conclusion.


85
00:08:31.307 --> 00:08:34.709
It is much more... gray.

86
00:08:36.212 --> 00:08:39.213
I want to thank Jane,
my PhD student...


87
00:08:39.282 --> 00:08:43.851
Thank you... who gave birth specifically
for the purpose of this class.


88
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:50.858
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a spy among us.


89
00:08:50.927 --> 00:08:56.664
Sitting in the back, that bearded
gentleman, is my son, Davis.


90
00:08:56.733 --> 00:08:58.900
What has he become?

91
00:09:00.536 --> 00:09:02.837
Ah.

92
00:09:02.906 --> 00:09:06.373
You're still dating
the, uh, ballerina?


93
00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:08.342
Cassie, yes.

94
00:09:08.411 --> 00:09:10.377
For almost two years now.

95
00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:12.580
Wow. It's been that long?
Mm-hmm.


96
00:09:12.648 --> 00:09:14.916
Well, that doesn't mean that
you still can't take out...


97
00:09:14.984 --> 00:09:17.384
one of my beautiful,
brilliant PhD students...


98
00:09:17.453 --> 00:09:19.921
on an innocent little
museum date, does it?


99
00:09:19.989 --> 00:09:23.191
That's exactly what it means, Dad.
Cassie moved in.


100
00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:25.026
Right, right.

101
00:09:25.095 --> 00:09:28.830
See, I always thought she was one of those
fun things, you know, like a placeholder.


102
00:09:28.898 --> 00:09:30.564
Why'd you think that?

103
00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.566
Well, she's
a little bit impulsive.


104
00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:34.702
Emotional, out of control.

105
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.638
Yeah. So?

106
00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:39.907
Your mom will be ecstatic
to see you.


107
00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:41.475
Hi.

108
00:09:42.612 --> 00:09:44.112
Hi, Mom.

109
00:09:46.382 --> 00:09:49.016
<i>That he
is good at creating jobs...</i>


110
00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:55.322
This can't be right.

111
00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:58.259
Four-letter word
for a World War II city.


112
00:10:00.663 --> 00:10:02.696
Rouen.

113
00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:04.899
It's St. Lo.

114
00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:06.600
You have to abbreviate it.

115
00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:08.870
S
-T
-L
-O.

116
00:10:08.938 --> 00:10:12.006
I hate when they don't tell you
that they are abbreviating.


117
00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:15.542
You just opened up
that whole corner though.


118
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:18.679
And the riddle.

119
00:10:22.652 --> 00:10:26.420
I was thinking about cooking for all of us.
Anything you want?


120
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.758
Oh. You're gonna do
your cooking thing?


121
00:10:32.962 --> 00:10:34.929
Okay.

122
00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:36.497
I ate already.

123
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.703
But yeah, you should...
go do that.


124
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.190
Hi.

125
00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:12.760
How's he doing today?
He's fine.


126
00:12:12.828 --> 00:12:14.828
Lots of napping.

127
00:12:16.165 --> 00:12:18.132
Could you give us a second?

128
00:12:18.201 --> 00:12:20.368
Yeah.
Thank you.


129
00:12:39.588 --> 00:12:41.923
I'm sorry, Davis.

130
00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:44.658
Can I talk to you
about something?


131
00:12:55.939 --> 00:12:59.340
Y... You know, your mother
painted this, Ronnie.


132
00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:01.769
You mean Grandma painted it.

133
00:13:02.378 --> 00:13:03.877
Right, Grandpa?

134
00:13:03.947 --> 00:13:06.228
I'm not Ronnie.
I'm Davis.


135
00:13:07.483 --> 00:13:08.983
Oh, yeah.

136
00:13:11.754 --> 00:13:13.620
Is that my dad?

137
00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:17.992
Yep.

138
00:13:20.763 --> 00:13:22.964
And who's that?

139
00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:25.466
That's Joshua.

140
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:28.069
What?

141
00:13:28.137 --> 00:13:31.305
Why, that's Joshua.

142
00:13:31.374 --> 00:13:32.873
Who's Joshua?

143
00:13:36.912 --> 00:13:39.413
We do not talk about Joshua.

144
00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:42.416
Why not?
Who is he?


145
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.920
No, no, no, no.

146
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.027
Easy. Okay.

147
00:13:53.096 --> 00:13:54.595
Shh. Okay, okay.
Ronnie!


148
00:13:54.663 --> 00:13:57.031
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Grandpa.

149
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.599
Shh.
Ronnie. Ronnie!


150
00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:00.301
Okay, easy. It's okay.
Ronnie!


151
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.536
- No, no, no, no.
- Shh! Shh!


152
00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:04.438
Ronnie!
Uh, excuse me!


153
00:14:04.507 --> 00:14:07.387
Can we get some help here, please?
No, no, no, no, no!


154
00:14:15.951 --> 00:14:18.419
Everything's gonna be okay.

155
00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:21.088
I want you to look at me.
Right here.


156
00:14:21.157 --> 00:14:23.157
<i>A fixed term next year.</i>

157
00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:26.293
<i>Interest groups spent more
than nine million dollars...</i>


158

<i>to influence the outcome of this

00:14:29.999 --> 00:14:33.667

Who is he?


160
00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:35.736
<i>According to a new report

00:15:02.098 --> 00:15:04.731
Davis, Davis, Davis, Davis!
Where are you going?


165
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.600
To check on Grandpa.
Why?


166
00:15:06.669 --> 00:15:10.237
What's wrong? Is there another relative
you're afraid he'll tell me about?


167
00:15:10.306 --> 00:15:12.773
Davis, wait a second.
What did you say to him?


168
00:15:12.841 --> 00:15:15.842
All I did was ask him to explain
the painting. Do you want to?


169
00:15:18.314 --> 00:15:20.314
You have a brother?

170
00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:24.718
No, I don't.

171
00:15:24.787 --> 00:15:26.287
Not anymore.

172
00:15:26.355 --> 00:15:27.555
What happened?

173
00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:32.826
<i>I can't even
begin to explain it,</i>


174
00:15:32.895 --> 00:15:35.896
<i>nor is it any
of your goddamn business.</i>


175
00:15:40.336 --> 00:15:42.869
<i>There's a reason
this has been kept from you.</i>


176
00:15:42.938 --> 00:15:44.805
<i>Leave it alone!</i>

177
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.178
<i>You don't know what you're about to do.
Trust me.</i>


178
00:16:43.032 --> 00:16:44.365
Hey.

179
00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:47.281
You know what time they open?

180
00:16:48.204 --> 00:16:49.903
In about an hour.

181
00:16:49.972 --> 00:16:52.606
You work here?
Nah, man.


182
00:16:52.675 --> 00:16:54.741
Just waiting for my refill.

183
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.410
Oh.
You too?


184
00:16:56.479 --> 00:16:58.111
Yeah.

185
00:16:58.181 --> 00:17:00.147
Wait, what?

186
00:17:04.353 --> 00:17:06.053
Check it out.

187
00:17:09.192 --> 00:17:11.225
What?

188
00:17:11.294 --> 00:17:13.827
I thought this was
a thrift shop.


189
00:17:13.896 --> 00:17:17.498
It is, man, but they've got
a dispensary inside.


190
00:17:19.635 --> 00:17:22.769
You know, they grow it
and sell it on their farm.


191
00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:27.474
If you don't tell them where you got
the address, I'll give it to you.


192
00:17:31.046 --> 00:17:33.347
I'll take that address.

193
00:17:35.851 --> 00:17:37.851
<i>Hi.
This is Cassie. Leave a message.</i>


194
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.721
Hey, Cass, it's me.

195
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:44.525
Uh, I have almost no service
here, so I hope you get this.


196
00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:47.695
I'm in a tiny town
called Dustin, New York,


197
00:17:47.763 --> 00:17:50.764
driving to my uncle's farm.

198
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.969
That girl who came
to visit me, Alexis...


199
00:17:56.038 --> 00:17:57.971
She wasn't lying.

200
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.674
She's my fucking cousin.

201
00:18:00.743 --> 00:18:03.877
My dad has a brother
who I guess...


202
00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:06.012
Fuck!

203
00:19:03.238 --> 00:19:05.339
Today I caught
a girl shoplifting.


204
00:19:05.408 --> 00:19:07.341
Okay. And
did you call the cops?


205
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.177
No, I let her keep it.
It was so cute on her.


206
00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:12.413
What? You can't just
give our clothes away.


207
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:15.182
It was like... It would've been two
dollars, She couldn't afford it.


208
00:19:18.153 --> 00:19:21.054
You know we're open, right?
You can come in.


209
00:19:21.123 --> 00:19:24.725
Oh. yeah. I'm just, uh...
I'm just lookin'.


210
00:19:24.794 --> 00:19:26.293
Thank you.

211
00:19:39.642 --> 00:19:43.109
Who was that? He was
just looking at dresses.


212
00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:25.018
Hey, guys!

213
00:20:39.935 --> 00:20:41.435
Hello.

214
00:20:41.504 --> 00:20:46.072
Hey, Alexis.
<i>Yeah?</i>


215
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:47.641
It's Davis.

216
00:20:49.244 --> 00:20:54.381
Hi.
Um, what do you want?


217
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.650
Can you talk?

218
00:20:59.522 --> 00:21:01.021
Sure.

219
00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:16.002
Hey!

220
00:21:16.071 --> 00:21:18.004
Hey.

221
00:21:25.815 --> 00:21:29.149
Why... Why did we have to
meet all the way out here?


222
00:21:29.217 --> 00:21:31.351
'Cause it's fun.

223
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.188
And my parents are home. I wanted to
make sure they didn't see me leave.


224
00:21:43.933 --> 00:21:46.266
Come on. I've got a
surprise for you.


225
00:21:46.335 --> 00:21:49.069
You sure my car's okay back there?
Yeah.


226
00:21:49.137 --> 00:21:52.272
You wanna tell me where we're goin'?
Nope.


227
00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:54.842
A hint maybe?

228
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.310
There's some people
you need to meet.


229
00:22:01.884 --> 00:22:04.585
Ladies, come on out.

230
00:22:07.422 --> 00:22:12.125
Davis Green, this is Amanda
Green and this is Annie Green.


231
00:22:13.261 --> 00:22:15.529
Wow. He looks
a little like Dad.


232
00:22:15.598 --> 00:22:18.231
No, he doesn't. Not now.
When he was younger.


233
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.703
Maybe in his hairline.

234
00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:25.211
Getting in?

235
00:22:27.543 --> 00:22:30.544
What? Are you mad I didn't
tell you about them before?


236
00:22:30.613 --> 00:22:32.112
No.

237
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:36.583
This is fuckin' awesome.

238
00:22:40.689 --> 00:22:43.657
You like it?

239
00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:57.971
So, uh, you have
any brothers or sisters?


240
00:22:59.575 --> 00:23:01.107
That's too bad.

241
00:23:03.412 --> 00:23:07.447
Beer.

242
00:23:09.618 --> 00:23:11.785
So, do you guys have any
idea what happened?


243
00:23:11.854 --> 00:23:14.287
You mean with our dads?
Yeah.


244
00:23:14.356 --> 00:23:16.857
Alexis tried to
bring it up once, but...


245
00:23:16.926 --> 00:23:19.092
- Yeah, that didn't go too well.
- We got threatened.


246
00:23:19.161 --> 00:23:20.694
So we dropped it.

247
00:23:20.763 --> 00:23:25.966
Dad said that if we tried to make
contact with you or your dad, then...


248
00:23:26.035 --> 00:23:29.036
- Then what?
- Bad things.


249
00:23:33.308 --> 00:23:36.810
Wait. You were at the store
today, weren't you?


250
00:23:36.879 --> 00:23:39.312
- Yeah.
- Were you spying on us?


251
00:23:39.381 --> 00:23:41.582
No! No.
Not... Not really.


252
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.850
Alexis stalked me
all over Boston.


253
00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:46.787
Oh, unemployed students have
time to do stuff like that.


254
00:23:46.855 --> 00:23:48.154
Fuck off, Amanda.

255
00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:53.326
Uh, so, do you have
a girlfriend?


256
00:23:53.395 --> 00:23:55.715
Mm-hmm. Any of you
have boyfriends?


257
00:24:00.235 --> 00:24:01.735
So, what's she do?

258
00:24:01.804 --> 00:24:04.938
She's a dancer at the
Charles Ballet of Boston.


259
00:24:05.007 --> 00:24:06.974
She seems really nice.
She's pretty.


260
00:24:07.042 --> 00:24:08.675
Wait, you met her?

261
00:24:10.112 --> 00:24:12.045
Kinda.

262
00:24:12.114 --> 00:24:14.681
So, how did you find me?

263
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.117
Um, well, I...

264
00:24:17.185 --> 00:24:19.920
I saw your dad in one
of my psych textbooks,


265
00:24:19.989 --> 00:24:21.722
and then, um, I googled him,

266
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.225
and I saw that you went
to Yale, and then I, um...


267
00:24:25.293 --> 00:24:29.562
Well, I found your
restaurant online, and so...


268
00:24:29.632 --> 00:24:32.065
She's a stalker.

269
00:24:32.134 --> 00:24:34.134
Look at that.

270
00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:38.639
So you went to Yale?

271
00:24:38.707 --> 00:24:40.573
Yeah, for psychology.

272
00:24:40.643 --> 00:24:43.476
So what do you do now?
I'm a chef.


273
00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:46.113
So mostly, I just
disappoint my parents.


274
00:24:46.181 --> 00:24:49.750
Yeah, they're not
too happy about that decision.


275
00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:52.019
Are you a sous chef?
I'm a head chef.


276
00:24:52.087 --> 00:24:54.320
Oh, that must be
a powerful position.


277
00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:56.623
In the kitchen.
Not in life, really.


278
00:24:56.692 --> 00:24:59.252
Oh, God, Alexis,
we're in public.


279
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.897
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

280
00:25:03.966 --> 00:25:08.434
It's just that I find it...
It's really sad, you know?


281
00:25:08.503 --> 00:25:10.170
What is?

282
00:25:10.238 --> 00:25:12.272
That we didn't grow up together.

283
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.608
Alexis, you haven't
had that much to drink...


284
00:25:15.678 --> 00:25:17.610
Yes, she has.
Maybe she should stop.


285
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.080
I'm not drunk, okay?

286
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:22.382
We apologize.
She is drunk.


287
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.985
It's okay.

288
00:25:27.556 --> 00:25:29.056
Oh, shit.

289
00:25:32.494 --> 00:25:35.929
Oh, my gosh.
Look who it is.


290
00:25:35.998 --> 00:25:38.464
- Who's he?
- Annie used to fuck him.


291
00:25:38.533 --> 00:25:41.634
You used to fuck that guy?

292
00:25:42.604 --> 00:25:44.104
Off and on.

293
00:25:44.173 --> 00:25:46.073
I thought we were dating,
but then...


294
00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:51.311
On the Fourth of July, I
accidentally went down on him.


295
00:25:53.182 --> 00:25:55.148
Accidentally?

296
00:25:55.217 --> 00:25:57.350
How do you accidentally...

297
00:25:57.419 --> 00:25:59.753
Oh, no. Never mind. That's
happened to me too.


298
00:25:59.822 --> 00:26:01.988
I am still pissed at you, Alexis.
I really liked him.


299
00:26:02.057 --> 00:26:04.825
I didn't even know
you guys were...


300
00:26:04.893 --> 00:26:07.961
And-And you are
way better off anyway.


301
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:13.967
It is a small town, which increases the
odds of something like that occurring.


302
00:26:20.275 --> 00:26:22.442
- What?
- What?


303
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.945
I fucked him too.
Just once, okay?


304
00:26:26.381 --> 00:26:28.115
You knew about this?

305
00:26:28.183 --> 00:26:30.583
That's a lot of coincidences.

306
00:26:30.652 --> 00:26:32.152
Oh, I...

307
00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:34.955
No, Amanda, give me your purse.

308
00:26:35.023 --> 00:26:37.023
- Why?
- Just give her your purse.


309
00:26:38.293 --> 00:26:40.660
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm really sorry.


310
00:26:40.729 --> 00:26:43.263
I'm gonna make it up to you.
I love you.


311
00:26:43.331 --> 00:26:45.265
Where the fuck are you going?

312
00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:47.200
She has a knife.

313
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:48.769
Come on.

314
00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:52.672
Hey, Teddy.
Hey.


315
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:55.208
How are you? What do
you want, Alexis?


316
00:26:55.277 --> 00:26:57.443
You're looking so good.
Fuck off.


317
00:26:57.512 --> 00:27:00.480
Oh, honey, you got
something... Whoa.


318
00:27:00.548 --> 00:27:01.815
What the...

319
00:27:01.884 --> 00:27:04.851
- What the fuck!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.


320
00:27:05.453 --> 00:27:07.220
Fucking whore!

321
00:27:09.491 --> 00:27:12.692
Oh, my... Go, go, go, fast!
Go fast!


322
00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:17.764
Come here!

323
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.300
What the hell was that?

324
00:27:20.368 --> 00:27:22.535
That was amazing is what it was!

325
00:27:22.604 --> 00:27:24.905
Have you ever punched
anyone before? No!


326
00:27:24.973 --> 00:27:28.141
- Why, did it look like I had?
- No!


327
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.943
Ah!
This is for you.


328
00:27:30.012 --> 00:27:32.679
Ew! Let's get the
fuck out of here!


329
00:28:19.194 --> 00:28:22.595
Now, be super fucking quiet
because Mom sleeps light.


330
00:28:22.664 --> 00:28:24.831
Wait, where are they?
Shh!


331
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.134
Don't worry. This is our space.
They never come down here.


332
00:28:30.205 --> 00:28:32.038
Do you not wanna stay?

333
00:28:32.107 --> 00:28:34.540
I just don't wanna meet them yet.

334
00:28:34.609 --> 00:28:38.144
Well, you know, we could set you an
alarm and get you out of here early.


335
00:28:38.213 --> 00:28:39.746
Yeah.

336
00:28:39.814 --> 00:28:42.214
Good night.
Yeah.


337
00:28:43.352 --> 00:28:45.218
Good night.

338
00:28:45.287 --> 00:28:46.953
Good night.
Good night.


339
00:28:50.392 --> 00:28:52.292
You can take my bed.

340
00:28:54.229 --> 00:28:56.296
I'll just...
That's where you sleep?


341
00:28:56.365 --> 00:28:58.765
Yeah. Oh!

342
00:28:58.833 --> 00:29:01.334
Where will you go?
On the floor.


343
00:29:01.403 --> 00:29:03.503
No. No, I'll stay on...

344
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:06.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you.


345
00:29:13.382 --> 00:29:15.515
As you can see,

346
00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:17.683
it's kinda hard to
bring guys back here.


347
00:29:17.752 --> 00:29:19.719
Because of your parents?

348
00:29:19.788 --> 00:29:23.456
Oh, no, they don't care. It's just
a small space for three girls.


349
00:29:24.793 --> 00:29:26.293
Why not move out?

350
00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:30.196
Oh, don't let the farm fool you.
We're pretty broke.


351
00:29:31.499 --> 00:29:33.633
So you date a lot?

352
00:29:33.701 --> 00:29:35.201
No.

353
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.737
I mean, I try.

354
00:29:37.806 --> 00:29:40.807
I just... I have shitty luck.

355
00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.644
I pick all the wrong ones.

356
00:29:47.082 --> 00:29:48.915
Hmm.

357
00:29:48.984 --> 00:29:51.651
Like that guy in the bar?

358
00:29:51.719 --> 00:29:55.888
That's not shitty luck.
That's shitty taste.


359
00:29:55.958 --> 00:30:00.293
Yeah, well, there aren't
many options up here.


360
00:30:00.362 --> 00:30:05.198
Well, from now on, every guy you
date has to be approved by me.


361
00:30:05.267 --> 00:30:07.367
That's sweet.

362
00:30:11.573 --> 00:30:13.073
Hey, Davis?

363
00:30:13.141 --> 00:30:15.508
Mm-hmm?

364
00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:20.080
I decided I like you now.

365
00:30:21.083 --> 00:30:23.583
I like you too.

366
00:31:33.721 --> 00:31:36.456
That can't be comfortable.

367
00:31:37.725 --> 00:31:39.725
It's not really.

368
00:31:50.372 --> 00:31:52.405
Mom.

369
00:31:52.474 --> 00:31:56.309
Um, Th...
This is, um...


370
00:31:56.378 --> 00:31:57.977
John.

371
00:31:58.046 --> 00:32:01.514
Well, breakfast will
be ready shortly, John.


372
00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:04.517
Oh, uh, thank you, but I...

373
00:32:04.586 --> 00:32:06.719
We have only one rule here.

374
00:32:06.788 --> 00:32:08.955
If you can't bring a guy
to the table,


375
00:32:09.023 --> 00:32:11.991
you probably shouldn't
be sleeping with him.


376
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.893
That's not a rule.

377
00:32:13.962 --> 00:32:16.496
Well, it should be.
And we're not...


378
00:32:16.565 --> 00:32:19.132
Right.
I'll see you upstairs.


379
00:32:26.274 --> 00:32:28.741
So much for your sisters
waking us up early.


380
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.676
Yeah, I bet they overslept too.

381
00:32:30.745 --> 00:32:32.545
How are we gonna do this?

382
00:32:32.614 --> 00:32:34.647
Well, my mom
didn't recognize you.


383
00:32:34.716 --> 00:32:36.882
What about your dad?

384
00:32:36.951 --> 00:32:39.352
Let's just say
you're my boyfriend.


385
00:32:59.341 --> 00:33:02.108
Dad, this is Jonathan.
We're dating.


386
00:33:02.177 --> 00:33:04.210
Hmm.

387
00:33:04.279 --> 00:33:06.179
Hi, Jonathan.

388
00:33:07.249 --> 00:33:09.115
What happened to the last guy?

389
00:33:09.184 --> 00:33:10.850
Dad shot him.

390
00:33:13.021 --> 00:33:15.288
You're not a vegetarian,
are you?


391
00:33:15.357 --> 00:33:18.224
- No.
- Good. Keep cutting.


392
00:33:18.293 --> 00:33:21.528
So, Jonathan,
how did you two meet?


393
00:33:21.596 --> 00:33:23.429
He was my TA.

394
00:33:23.498 --> 00:33:25.865
Oh, yeah? For what class?

395
00:33:25.933 --> 00:33:28.100
Developmental Psych.

396
00:33:31.439 --> 00:33:34.307
You want some eggs?
Sure.


397
00:33:34.376 --> 00:33:36.309
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're out of bacon.


398
00:33:36.378 --> 00:33:39.111
Amanda, go kill another pig
after breakfast.


399
00:33:39.181 --> 00:33:42.549
- I can't do it today. Make Alexis do it.
- Ew, gross.


400
00:33:42.617 --> 00:33:45.918
I have to work two jobs and now this?
Yeah, that's fair.


401
00:33:45.987 --> 00:33:47.753
I'm not doing it.
Annie, you do it.


402
00:33:47.822 --> 00:33:50.156
- I have to open the store.
- Fine.


403
00:33:50.225 --> 00:33:52.992
Jonathan and I will do it.

404
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:54.661
I'm sorry?

405
00:33:54.729 --> 00:33:56.762
I'm stuck out here in the
woods with four women.


406
00:33:56.831 --> 00:33:59.332
First time a guy's
been around in a while.


407
00:33:59.401 --> 00:34:02.235
I don't know
how much help I would be.


408
00:34:02.304 --> 00:34:04.304
Well, you're fucking
my daughter.


409
00:34:04.372 --> 00:34:08.575
The least you can do is keep me
some company while I kill a pig.


410
00:34:08.643 --> 00:34:11.644
Joshua.
Dad!


411
00:34:26.461 --> 00:34:28.261
Are the pigs back there?

412
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:33.266
No. Pigs stink like shit. We
don't keep them near the house.


413
00:34:33.335 --> 00:34:34.834
Get in.

414
00:34:49.351 --> 00:34:51.217
Just so you know, sir,

415
00:34:51.286 --> 00:34:54.854
I would never even think about
sleeping with your daughter.


416
00:34:54.922 --> 00:34:56.889
Now, that sounds like an insult.

417
00:34:56.958 --> 00:35:01.327
No. I mean, I would.

418
00:35:01.396 --> 00:35:03.396
I'm just not.

419
00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:34.560
What does that do?

420
00:35:34.629 --> 00:35:37.697
Kills the pig on contact. This
way you don't have to bleed it.


421
00:35:37.766 --> 00:35:40.633
Very little suffering.
Very humane.


422
00:35:40.702 --> 00:35:43.503
What now? We just go
in there and zap one?


423
00:35:43.571 --> 00:35:47.340
I'll tell you what now.
Stop fucking with me!


424
00:35:52.213 --> 00:35:53.713
Yes, sir.

425
00:35:53.782 --> 00:35:56.482
He send you here to spy on me?

426
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:59.385
Who? Don't insult my
intelligence, man.


427
00:35:59.454 --> 00:36:01.954
I know you're my brother's son.

428
00:36:05.092 --> 00:36:08.628
Actually, your daughters
said I look a bit like you...


429
00:36:08.697 --> 00:36:10.830
when you were younger.

430
00:36:14.803 --> 00:36:17.036
I don't see it.

431
00:36:30.952 --> 00:36:34.420
<i>♪ Mud on my shoes
Shoes on my feet ♪</i>


432
00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:38.658
<i>♪ I've been walking
up and down the street ♪</i>


433
00:36:38.727 --> 00:36:42.528
<i>♪ Buddy, I've seen
a thing or two ♪</i>


434
00:36:42.597 --> 00:36:44.530
So did you go to college?

435
00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:47.900
Yeah. Why do you ask?

436
00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:49.935
Just curious...

437
00:36:50.004 --> 00:36:52.472
if maybe you'd also
studied psychology.


438
00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.540
I studied philosophy.

439
00:36:55.744 --> 00:36:58.578
Did you go to Yale too?
No way.


440
00:36:58.646 --> 00:37:01.814
Fuck that place.

441
00:37:01.883 --> 00:37:03.883
I went to Harvard.

442
00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:27.740
Sorry I didn't get
to see you grow up.


443
00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:29.742
It's all right.

444
00:37:31.045 --> 00:37:33.546
So, what now?

445
00:37:33.615 --> 00:37:36.348
Nothing.
Have a good life.


446
00:37:37.952 --> 00:37:40.085
That's it?

447
00:37:40.154 --> 00:37:42.889
You don't want to see him?
Nope.


448
00:37:42.957 --> 00:37:45.625
- Why not?
- Plenty of reasons.


449
00:37:45.693 --> 00:37:48.628
Give me one. Because he
doesn't want to see me.


450
00:37:48.696 --> 00:37:52.264
You guys are brothers. What
could have possibly happened?


451
00:37:55.403 --> 00:37:59.171
Why the fuck do you think
I'd tell you that?


452
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.509
What we have between us,
it's unresolvable.


453
00:38:03.578 --> 00:38:06.078
If I knew what happened,
would I hate you?


454
00:38:06.147 --> 00:38:09.415
It was nice to meet you, Davis.

455
00:38:22.764 --> 00:38:24.597
Wh... Where are you going?

456
00:38:24.666 --> 00:38:27.199
I need you to drive me
back to my car.


457
00:38:28.636 --> 00:38:30.135
Why?

458
00:38:30.204 --> 00:38:32.171
He knew who I was, Alexis,

459
00:38:32.239 --> 00:38:34.440
as soon as he saw me.

460
00:38:35.777 --> 00:38:38.077
Okay. So here's what we'll do.
We'll...


461
00:38:38.145 --> 00:38:41.080
No, I need you to
drive me back to my car.


462
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.984
No.

463
00:38:45.052 --> 00:38:47.587
Then I'll walk.

464
00:38:47.655 --> 00:38:49.789
You're just... What?

465
00:38:53.227 --> 00:38:54.760
Davis.

466
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:57.129
Davis.
Davis, wait, please.


467
00:38:57.198 --> 00:38:59.331
Your dad asked me to leave.

468
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.534
So what? I have to do
this all by myself?


469
00:39:01.603 --> 00:39:03.102
Do what?

470
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.738
Find a way to get our
families back together.


471
00:39:05.807 --> 00:39:07.306
That's what you want to do?

472
00:39:07.375 --> 00:39:08.975
Unless I'm imagining things,

473
00:39:09.043 --> 00:39:11.410
it seems like you were
enjoying your break up here.


474
00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:13.946
Wait. What?

475
00:39:14.749 --> 00:39:17.316
From your girlfriend.

476
00:39:17.385 --> 00:39:18.784
Break?

477
00:39:18.853 --> 00:39:21.120
I... I-I didn't mean it
like that.


478
00:39:21.188 --> 00:39:24.924
I just mean you were
having a good time,


479
00:39:24.993 --> 00:39:29.328
and I picked up on a vibe that
you guys are having problems.


480
00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:32.431
Sorry to pry.

481
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.634
She had an abortion, Alexis.

482
00:39:36.404 --> 00:39:38.905
Oh, my gosh.

483
00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:45.878
Yeah, so that brought up
a lot of shit between us.


484
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.084
Davis, I'm so sorry.

485
00:39:52.153 --> 00:39:54.420
Yeah, thanks.

486
00:39:57.592 --> 00:40:00.893
So, what if I stayed?

487
00:40:02.363 --> 00:40:04.697
What's your plan?

488
00:40:04.766 --> 00:40:07.499
I don't know, but if you do,

489
00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:09.869
I know that we'll
figure something out.


490
00:40:09.938 --> 00:40:14.574
And now we've stirred it all
up, it's dumb to just drop it.


491
00:40:20.048 --> 00:40:23.348
I can't believe
I'm just meeting you now.


492
00:40:32.193 --> 00:40:33.993
I'll come back to visit.

493
00:40:34.996 --> 00:40:37.229
Okay?

494
00:40:37.298 --> 00:40:38.798
I promise.

495
00:40:43.104 --> 00:40:45.071
Promise me something else.

496
00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:46.639
What?

497
00:40:48.142 --> 00:40:50.509
That if you do leave now,

498
00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:53.813
it's not because you're
afraid of what's going on.


499
00:40:54.816 --> 00:40:57.097
I'm not afraid
of what's going on.


500
00:41:01.022 --> 00:41:03.656
Not with our dads.
With us.


501
00:41:15.302 --> 00:41:16.869
No?

502
00:41:29.617 --> 00:41:31.117
Okay.

503
00:41:33.554 --> 00:41:36.455
Come on. I'll take you
to your car.


504
00:41:52.339 --> 00:41:54.206
Alexis?

505
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:58.477
I do know what's going on,

506
00:41:58.546 --> 00:42:01.781
but I promise that's not
why I'm leaving.


507
00:42:03.284 --> 00:42:04.784
No?

508
00:42:09.223 --> 00:42:10.764
What the fuck are you doing?

509
00:42:10.789 --> 00:42:13.649
I need to show you
something before you leave.


510
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.841
How long is this gonna take?

511
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:30.843
Just a few minutes.

512
00:42:51.332 --> 00:42:53.665
What is this place?

513
00:42:53.735 --> 00:42:57.169
Well, when we were little, my parents got
in a fight and I followed my dad here.


514
00:42:57.238 --> 00:43:00.106
He doesn't know I know about it.

515
00:43:00.174 --> 00:43:02.474
There's so much stuff.

516
00:43:06.948 --> 00:43:09.681
I know.

517
00:43:09.751 --> 00:43:11.884
Here. Look at this.

518
00:43:39.747 --> 00:43:41.413
What's up here?

519
00:43:42.716 --> 00:43:44.650
I have no idea. What?

520
00:43:55.096 --> 00:43:56.595
Come up here.

521
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.074
Oh. Wow.

522
00:44:25.126 --> 00:44:27.059
It's plugged in.

523
00:44:33.167 --> 00:44:34.666
Should we?

524
00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:09.969
Oh, Jesus.

525
00:45:10.037 --> 00:45:12.838
What?
I think that's my dad.


526
00:45:14.508 --> 00:45:17.142
The one on the right.

527
00:45:18.679 --> 00:45:20.512
He's handsome.

528
00:45:25.253 --> 00:45:27.486
- Is the other one your dad?
- Yeah.


529
00:45:31.725 --> 00:45:34.726
They look so happy.
Mmm.


530
00:45:42.836 --> 00:45:44.970
Is that your mom, maybe?

531
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.376
No. Yours?

532
00:45:50.444 --> 00:45:51.944
No.

533
00:45:54.115 --> 00:45:56.282
She's so pretty.

534
00:46:47.435 --> 00:46:49.734
No, wait. There's more.

535
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:02.807
Could this all be over a girl?

536
00:48:08.115 --> 00:48:09.848
Maybe.

537
00:48:41.882 --> 00:48:44.316
You coming down?

538
00:48:44.385 --> 00:48:46.751
Yeah, one second.

539
00:49:05.573 --> 00:49:07.872
Look what I found!

540
00:49:07.941 --> 00:49:11.676
Look, it's the one the girl
was wearing in the film.


541
00:49:14.315 --> 00:49:16.548
Put it back. Carefully.

542
00:49:21.455 --> 00:49:23.888
Let's just leave everything
exactly as it was.


543
00:49:42.976 --> 00:49:45.377
Your dad seemed really
into that girl.


544
00:49:45.446 --> 00:49:47.746
Yeah, they both did.

545
00:49:47.814 --> 00:49:51.016
She was pretty.
Mm.


546
00:49:51.084 --> 00:49:54.164
Thank you for bringing me here.

547
00:52:03.751 --> 00:52:05.651
We should go.

548
00:53:20.227 --> 00:53:21.893
Holy shit.

549
00:53:21.962 --> 00:53:24.563
What?
Stop the car.


550
00:53:25.265 --> 00:53:26.765
Stop the car!

551
00:53:30.337 --> 00:53:33.605
What the fuck?

552
00:53:36.777 --> 00:53:38.610
What are you doing here?

553
00:53:38.679 --> 00:53:40.779
Oh, Davis. Thank God.

554
00:53:40.848 --> 00:53:42.614
I came to look for you.

555
00:53:42.683 --> 00:53:45.650
Hi.

556
00:53:45.719 --> 00:53:47.285
I don't know what happened.

557
00:53:47.354 --> 00:53:49.020
I just can't get
the car to start.


558
00:53:49.089 --> 00:53:51.423
I tried calling AAA, but I can't
get anybody on the phone.


559
00:53:51.492 --> 00:53:53.224
There's no reception
or something.


560
00:53:53.293 --> 00:53:54.959
What?
Is that her?


561
00:53:55.028 --> 00:53:56.788
Davis, a tow's
gonna take forever.


562
00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.697
We've got jumper cables
at the house.


563
00:53:59.966 --> 00:54:02.333
Hi... again.

564
00:54:02.403 --> 00:54:04.269
Maybe I left the
lights on overnight.


565
00:54:04.337 --> 00:54:08.440
You know, it's Kristin's car and I
don't know what all the buttons do.


566
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:12.343
Well, we could jump it.

567
00:54:12.413 --> 00:54:15.573
- You think she can help?
- Yep.


568
00:54:15.616 --> 00:54:17.115
You okay?

569
00:54:17.183 --> 00:54:18.683
Yeah, I'm okay.

570
00:54:18.752 --> 00:54:21.352
- You sure?
- Yeah.


571
00:54:23.757 --> 00:54:26.825
So, how did you find me?

572
00:54:26.894 --> 00:54:30.295
I drove into the main
part of town. I just asked around.


573
00:54:30.363 --> 00:54:31.530
Oh.

574
00:54:31.598 --> 00:54:34.499
So, Cassie, what brings
you all the way up here?


575
00:54:34.568 --> 00:54:38.088
I'm here to talk to
Davis about something.


576
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.507
You mind
giving us just a second?


577
00:54:42.576 --> 00:54:44.242
I called a lot.

578
00:54:45.712 --> 00:54:47.211
You not picking up?

579
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.981
Oh, yeah. I've got
bad, uh, cell service.


580
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:51.516
Oh.

581
00:54:51.585 --> 00:54:53.785
Um...

582
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:55.520
Davis.

583
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:59.257
Your parents actually
asked me to find you.


584
00:54:59.326 --> 00:55:02.794
But you didn't tell them
I was here, did you?


585
00:55:02.863 --> 00:55:04.496
Yeah, I did.

586
00:55:04.565 --> 00:55:07.532
Cassie! I'm sorry. It
was important to them.


587
00:55:11.171 --> 00:55:12.838
Sweetie,

588
00:55:13.907 --> 00:55:16.675
I wanted to wait until
we were alone, um...


589
00:55:21.147 --> 00:55:24.415
Babe, your grandfather
passed away.


590
00:55:28.689 --> 00:55:31.289
I'm so sorry.

591
00:55:33.927 --> 00:55:36.427
<i>The last time I saw him...</i>

592
00:55:37.731 --> 00:55:40.398
I asked about your dad,

593
00:55:40.467 --> 00:55:45.470
and he...
freaked out...


594
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:51.109
and had, like,
a panic attack or something.


595
00:55:53.446 --> 00:55:54.946
This is my fault.

596
00:55:55.015 --> 00:55:56.815
No.

597
00:55:56.884 --> 00:55:58.783
No, no, no, sweetie.

598
00:55:58.852 --> 00:56:01.085
Sweetie, he was old.

599
00:56:01.154 --> 00:56:03.454
What was he like?

600
00:56:03.524 --> 00:56:07.726
He was charming.
Smart.


601
00:56:08.629 --> 00:56:12.263
But he was stubborn,
like my dad.


602
00:56:12.332 --> 00:56:14.065
Like<i>your</i> dad...

603
00:56:14.134 --> 00:56:16.001
I guess.

604
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:17.903
Davis, I need to
talk to you outside.


605
00:56:40.694 --> 00:56:42.928
You didn't even know him.

606
00:56:42.996 --> 00:56:47.131
I know. That's what makes
this so fucking sad.


607
00:56:51.004 --> 00:56:52.971
I know you have to go now,

608
00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:57.576
but please promise me this
isn't the last time I see you.


609
00:56:59.112 --> 00:57:00.612
Of course.

610
00:57:02.382 --> 00:57:05.617
Now, maybe this could...
This could work.


611
00:57:15.261 --> 00:57:17.696
We're going to the funeral.

612
00:57:21.034 --> 00:57:24.135
No. Absolutely not.

613
00:57:25.205 --> 00:57:26.738
What?

614
00:57:26.807 --> 00:57:29.641
If they wanted me there,
I'd have gotten a call.


615
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.409
Yeah, but he's your dad too.

616
00:57:31.478 --> 00:57:33.645
I am not going to his house.

617
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:39.550
You wouldn't have
to go to Ronald's,


618
00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.352
if that makes a difference.

619
00:57:41.421 --> 00:57:45.223
They're burying him at the family
cabin in the mountains tonight.


620
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:47.726
Just a quiet little thing
with Ronald and Marsha.


621
00:57:47.794 --> 00:57:50.762
You owe us this because you
never let us meet our grandfather.


622
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:53.791
I mean, the least you can
do is let us say good-bye.


623
00:57:55.068 --> 00:57:57.508
She's right.

624
00:59:12.846 --> 00:59:15.246
They're running late.

625
00:59:15.315 --> 00:59:17.555
The body won't be here
until the morning.


626
00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:20.118
It's a good thing he's dead.

627
00:59:20.187 --> 00:59:22.921
It'd kill him to know
he was late to something.


628
00:59:26.226 --> 00:59:29.293
There's a motel at the
base of the mountain...


629
00:59:29.362 --> 00:59:31.196
by the gas station.

630
00:59:31.264 --> 00:59:34.099
I think we'll stay the night
here, if that's okay with you.


631
00:59:37.738 --> 00:59:39.704
Plenty of room, right?

632
00:59:46.947 --> 00:59:49.447
Good. So we'll stay.

633
00:59:49.515 --> 00:59:51.549
And I'll help with the body
in the morning.


634
00:59:57.357 --> 01:00:00.957
Suit yourself. You can
stay in the basement.


635
01:00:05.265 --> 01:00:06.931
Yeah, I'm hungry too.

636
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.667
Why don't you get those
little crackers from the car?


637
01:00:09.736 --> 01:00:11.502
Dad! He's
making everyone dinner.


638
01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:15.640
Well, if it's good, maybe
it's worth waiting for, huh?


639
01:00:18.478 --> 01:00:22.180
Oh, um, come join us.

640
01:00:22.249 --> 01:00:24.382
Uh...

641
01:00:27.353 --> 01:00:29.020
We're drinking your wine, so...

642
01:00:38.765 --> 01:00:40.832
Can you cut those up smaller?

643
01:00:40.901 --> 01:00:42.967
Yeah, sure.

644
01:00:43.036 --> 01:00:44.535
Quickly, sweetie.

645
01:00:44.604 --> 01:00:46.404
Fine. I'm not as good
at this as you are.


646
01:00:46.472 --> 01:00:49.073
Fine. I'll do it.
I can do it.


647
01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:56.381
Hey, are you doin' okay?

648
01:01:06.526 --> 01:01:09.406
I'm sorry for how I
behaved last week.


649
01:01:11.164 --> 01:01:13.464
But I think that
these last few days...


650
01:01:13.533 --> 01:01:16.034
have been really good for me.

651
01:01:16.102 --> 01:01:18.169
How about you?

652
01:01:18.238 --> 01:01:20.671
Hey, anyone want some wine?

653
01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.074
Uh, maybe after I'm done.

654
01:01:23.143 --> 01:01:25.583
It'll make it all go smoother.

655
01:01:26.379 --> 01:01:29.419
Oh, and I'll come back and
help you cut stuff as well.


656
01:01:30.984 --> 01:01:32.450
Thanks.

657
01:01:32.518 --> 01:01:34.285
Uh, can I have some too?

658
01:01:34.354 --> 01:01:37.055
Oh, yeah, sure.

659
01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:47.232
This is a cool house.

660
01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.833
I'm glad you like it.

661
01:01:52.705 --> 01:01:54.405
Dinner's almost ready.

662
01:01:54.474 --> 01:01:56.074
Oh, good.

663
01:02:02.148 --> 01:02:03.848
Want to sit down?

664
01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.900
If not, we can make
you a to-go plate.


665
01:02:12.692 --> 01:02:14.525
Ronnie, I'm kidding, please.

666
01:02:14.594 --> 01:02:17.328
We should be able
to handle this.


667
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.519
Do you want some wine?

668
01:02:41.587 --> 01:02:44.322
Don't bother.
He doesn't like wine.


669
01:02:49.296 --> 01:02:51.963
I'll get him his drink.

670
01:03:07.113 --> 01:03:10.281
Um, do you need help
with something?


671
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:12.350
Just some Red Label.

672
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.821
- He's down there?
- Yeah.


673
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:19.023
Wow.

674
01:03:19.092 --> 01:03:21.259
How'd you pull that off?

675
01:03:21.328 --> 01:03:24.495
It's easy to despise someone
from a distance.


676
01:03:24.564 --> 01:03:26.464
Put them across a table, though,

677
01:03:26.532 --> 01:03:29.567
most men won't pursue a
conflict if they can help it.


678
01:03:31.304 --> 01:03:34.038
Your dad's a great example.

679
01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:36.707
Of what?

680
01:03:38.078 --> 01:03:39.643
A coward.

681
01:03:53.926 --> 01:03:55.526
That's your drink, right?

682
01:04:13.713 --> 01:04:15.546
Good memory.

683
01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:20.151
So, who's gonna lose it tonight?

684
01:04:21.254 --> 01:04:22.753
You are.

685
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:27.492
No, not me.

686
01:04:30.163 --> 01:04:32.430
What are you guys talking about?

687
01:04:33.766 --> 01:04:35.266
May I?

688
01:04:42.509 --> 01:04:45.243
Ronnie and I spent every
summer here growing up.


689
01:04:45.311 --> 01:04:47.211
One summer, we were alone,

690
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.248
so every weekend was 48
hours straight of drinking.


691
01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:54.152
Every few weekends
we'd wake up to see...


692
01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.587
that someone had
vomited somewhere.


693
01:04:56.656 --> 01:04:58.956
I'd accuse Ronnie of not being
able to hold his liquor.


694
01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:01.325
He'd accuse me.

695
01:05:01.394 --> 01:05:04.295
But neither of us
could remember.


696
01:05:05.865 --> 01:05:10.101
Ronnie, being the prankster he
was, suggested an experiment.


697
01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:11.802
We ate pasta for dinner.

698
01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:14.539
I had marinara, he had Alfredo.

699
01:05:14.607 --> 01:05:17.475
Josh, if you're gonna
tell it, tell it right.


700
01:05:17.544 --> 01:05:20.878
I had marinara
and you had Alfredo.


701
01:05:21.914 --> 01:05:24.549
We threw the biggest party
of the summer.


702
01:05:24.617 --> 01:05:29.554
And we probably drank a little
bit more than we should've.


703
01:05:29.622 --> 01:05:32.256
So in the morning,

704
01:05:32.325 --> 01:05:34.092
the vomit...

705
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:38.096
was either red or white.

706
01:05:38.164 --> 01:05:40.864
And then we'd know whose it was.

707
01:05:45.605 --> 01:05:48.739
Um, so...

708
01:05:48.808 --> 01:05:50.708
what color was it?

709
01:05:53.413 --> 01:05:55.913
It was pink.

710
01:06:02.122 --> 01:06:03.988
What's so funny?

711
01:06:04.056 --> 01:06:06.324
Why did you tell that story?

712
01:06:06.392 --> 01:06:09.160
I still think it was you.

713
01:06:17.737 --> 01:06:19.504
Did I hear them laughing
down there?


714
01:06:19.572 --> 01:06:21.272
Yeah, look what we've done.

715
01:06:21.341 --> 01:06:23.407
Well, it's still early.

716
01:06:23.476 --> 01:06:25.610
So, we should
get them all drunk.


717
01:06:25.678 --> 01:06:27.411
How much have you had?

718
01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.979
Just a little bit.

719
01:06:29.048 --> 01:06:31.915
Babe, the table is set.

720
01:06:31.984 --> 01:06:34.585
Oh, um, family meeting.
Do not disturb.


721
01:06:34.654 --> 01:06:36.954
Um, what?

722
01:06:37.023 --> 01:06:39.657
Sorry. What I meant
to say is, um...


723
01:06:39.725 --> 01:06:41.759
Go away.

724
01:06:50.503 --> 01:06:53.337
Alexis, you may never
speak like that...


725
01:06:53.406 --> 01:06:55.173
to my girlfriend.

726
01:06:55.241 --> 01:06:57.308
- What did I...
- Do you understand?


727
01:06:59.045 --> 01:07:00.545
Why are you being so mean?

728
01:07:00.613 --> 01:07:02.913
Because you're acting
like a little fucking girl.


729
01:07:04.717 --> 01:07:08.117
You treat me so
differently around her.


730
01:07:08.888 --> 01:07:11.222
Look, I know
that what happened...


731
01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:14.158
was really, really
fucked up, okay?


732
01:07:14.227 --> 01:07:17.127
No, it wasn't.
Yes!


733
01:07:17.197 --> 01:07:19.263
Yes, it was.

734
01:07:19.332 --> 01:07:21.566
And we'll deal with it, okay?

735
01:07:21.634 --> 01:07:23.133
I promise.
We will, later.


736
01:07:23.203 --> 01:07:24.968
But the way
that you're acting now,


737
01:07:25.037 --> 01:07:26.870
you're making me
regret all this.


738
01:07:26.939 --> 01:07:30.575
Coming here and meeting
you... everything.


739
01:07:33.913 --> 01:07:35.413
Look...

740
01:07:37.317 --> 01:07:40.685
Jesus fucking Christ, Alexis!

741
01:07:41.887 --> 01:07:46.123
What are you gonna do?
Tell on me?


742
01:07:48.494 --> 01:07:51.696
It's all so fun
because they're right there.


743
01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:54.198
We're done, you understand me?

744
01:07:54.267 --> 01:07:56.601
You'll never see me again
after tomorrow.


745
01:08:11.784 --> 01:08:13.284
Let's eat.

746
01:10:49.409 --> 01:10:51.442
It's good.

747
01:11:22.041 --> 01:11:24.141
Alexis, where did you get that?

748
01:11:32.017 --> 01:11:34.151
You know where I got it.

749
01:11:34.219 --> 01:11:36.720
May I see that, please?

750
01:11:36.789 --> 01:11:38.923
Sweetie, take that off
and hand it to me now.


751
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:45.395
Now!

752
01:11:45.465 --> 01:11:47.998
What else have ya got, Josh?

753
01:11:48.067 --> 01:11:49.867
I didn't think you'd want
any of her stuff.


754
01:11:49.936 --> 01:11:51.836
At the end, you wanted
nothing to do with Rebecca.


755
01:11:51.904 --> 01:11:53.737
Don't you dare mention her name.

756
01:11:53.806 --> 01:11:55.539
And you shouldn't
assume anything.


757
01:11:55.608 --> 01:11:58.308
Let's see if I'm in the will,
then maybe we can negotiate.


758
01:11:58.377 --> 01:11:59.877
That's the reason
why you're here.


759
01:11:59.946 --> 01:12:02.412
Well, what if it is? What are
you gonna do, disown me again?


760
01:12:02.482 --> 01:12:04.247
- I know it's your hobby.
- Give that to me.


761
01:12:04.316 --> 01:12:06.116
Give it to me!
Ronnie, no.


762
01:12:06.185 --> 01:12:07.825
- Alexis, come over here.
- Give it to me.


763
01:12:07.854 --> 01:12:10.220
- Give that to me!
- Alexis, give it to me.


764
01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:13.290
Let's bring it upstairs, then we can all
figure out what we want to do with it.


765
01:12:13.359 --> 01:12:15.626
- Please...
- Shut up, Cassie!


766
01:12:15.695 --> 01:12:18.362
This is not your family.
You need to fucking leave!


767
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:21.750
Why? So you can have your
cousin all to yourself?


768
01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:31.308
What was that?

769
01:12:31.377 --> 01:12:33.777
I saw you two upstairs. There's
obviously something going on.


770
01:12:33.846 --> 01:12:36.647
What? Th
-That's not true!

771
01:12:38.651 --> 01:12:40.450
Cassie, that's not true.

772
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.326
What is going on here, Josh?

773
01:12:49.395 --> 01:12:51.795
I don't know.
Don't look at me.


774
01:12:53.198 --> 01:12:54.565
All of you.

775
01:12:54.634 --> 01:12:56.734
You,<i>you!</i>

776
01:12:56.802 --> 01:12:58.602
Stay away from my son!

777
01:12:58.671 --> 01:13:01.271
There's something wrong with you, Josh.
You're sick.


778
01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.940
And you passed it along
to your kids.


779
01:13:03.009 --> 01:13:04.441
Don't you dare!

780
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.309
You fucking pervert!

781
01:13:07.479 --> 01:13:09.013
You took advantage of her, Josh.

782
01:13:10.783 --> 01:13:12.282
You took advantage of her.

783
01:13:12.351 --> 01:13:15.986
You killed Rebecca and you know
goddamn well that you did!


784
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:20.123
Stop it!

785
01:13:21.427 --> 01:13:22.826
No!

786
01:13:22.895 --> 01:13:24.962
Stop! Stop it!

787
01:13:28.868 --> 01:13:30.300
Get off, get off him!

788
01:13:31.704 --> 01:13:35.172
Davis! Davis!
Davis! Davis!


789
01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.540
Stop it!

790
01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:41.378
Mind your business,
you jealous cunt!


791
01:13:41.447 --> 01:13:43.480
Why the fuck should I
be jealous of you?


792
01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:46.116
Because Davis hasn't been able to keep
his eyes off me since he got here.


793
01:13:46.185 --> 01:13:48.318
And I think he's happy
you had that abortion...


794
01:13:48.387 --> 01:13:51.388
so that he doesn't
have to be stuck with you.


795
01:13:55.761 --> 01:13:58.662
And in case you haven't realized,
your boyfriend and I...


796
01:14:22.888 --> 01:14:24.822
Alexis.

797
01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.521
You know, my dad hired people who
are coming to take care of that.


798
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:33.190
Couldn't sleep.

799
01:15:33.258 --> 01:15:35.659
Thought I'd help us
get out of here faster.


800
01:15:37.262 --> 01:15:39.262
You seen Cassie?

801
01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:41.799
She took off, man.
Real early.


802
01:15:41.867 --> 01:15:45.135
I asked if she'd be back.
She said "no."


803
01:15:46.338 --> 01:15:48.271
How's your face?

804
01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:53.577
We should see your dad
before we declare a winner.


805
01:15:55.848 --> 01:15:58.381
So are you a murderer, Josh?

806
01:15:59.451 --> 01:16:02.152
If I am, then your dad is too.

807
01:16:02.221 --> 01:16:03.821
What did you do?

808
01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:07.524
I need some help.

809
01:16:08.393 --> 01:16:10.094
Come here.

810
01:16:22.074 --> 01:16:24.775
You know, you and I are more
alike than you might think.


811
01:16:24.844 --> 01:16:26.977
How's that?

812
01:16:27.046 --> 01:16:29.847
Well, your dad's a man of
careful words and thoughts.


813
01:16:29.915 --> 01:16:33.350
But when I saw you punch
Alexis, it clicked.


814
01:16:33.418 --> 01:16:34.918
I don't follow.

815
01:16:34.987 --> 01:16:37.988
If you'd thought about it,
you would've never done it.


816
01:16:38.057 --> 01:16:39.990
But you did.

817
01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:43.326
There are lots of things that
are out of our control, Davis.


818
01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:46.930
Almost everything is, actually.

819
01:16:46.999 --> 01:16:49.439
So you stole his girl?

820
01:16:49.701 --> 01:16:52.502
This... Rebecca.

821
01:16:52.571 --> 01:16:55.005
And he never forgave you.

822
01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:13.857
Rebecca was our sister.

823
01:17:20.266 --> 01:17:24.134
Your dad found out about us
and he told the entire family.


824
01:17:24.203 --> 01:17:26.569
They shunned us
and it ruined her life.


825
01:17:27.539 --> 01:17:30.040
He shamed her
into killing herself.


826
01:17:32.744 --> 01:17:37.080
Oh, come on, Davis. From what we heard
last night, are you in any place to judge?


827
01:17:39.118 --> 01:17:41.751
I know how you feel about her.

828
01:17:41.821 --> 01:17:45.789
Your dad will never
forgive you for it.


829
01:17:47.259 --> 01:17:49.059
But I will.

830
01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:39.869
Davis,

831
01:19:39.939 --> 01:19:41.571
I was thinking.

832
01:19:42.975 --> 01:19:47.110
Maybe I could take your car
back and you could ride with...


833
01:20:11.736 --> 01:20:15.372
We don't have to ever
talk about this again.


834
01:20:20.812 --> 01:20:22.912
We can talk about it.

835
01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:28.952
That girl, your cousin,

836
01:20:29.021 --> 01:20:31.521
she's just like my brother.

837
01:20:33.092 --> 01:20:34.757
How's that?

838
01:20:34.826 --> 01:20:37.027
Dangerous.

839
01:20:39.598 --> 01:20:42.565
Your behavior,

840
01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:45.502
your feelings for her,

841
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:47.770
it's curiosity,
it's... it's...


842
01:20:47.839 --> 01:20:50.773
From not having known her.

843
01:20:50.842 --> 01:20:53.843
It's not...
Dad...


844
01:20:53.912 --> 01:20:56.613
You know.
Please.


845
01:21:04.256 --> 01:21:06.089
I'm sorry.

846
01:21:15.967 --> 01:21:18.201
For what?

847
01:21:21.773 --> 01:21:24.141
For everything.

848
01:21:27.579 --> 01:21:29.279
I guess I thought that...

849
01:21:30.682 --> 01:21:33.183
getting our families together
would've been a good thing.


850
01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.421
And what do you think now?

851
01:21:42.961 --> 01:21:46.029
I think they're assholes.

852
01:22:00.745 --> 01:22:04.381
- <i>Hi, this is Cassie. 
Leave a message.</i>

853
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:07.317
Hey, Cass, it's me.

854
01:22:07.386 --> 01:22:09.919
I'm back in town,
staying at Todd's,


855
01:22:09.988 --> 01:22:15.625
so you know where to find me
whenever you want to talk.


856
01:22:15.694 --> 01:22:17.194
Okay. Bye.

857
01:22:24.536 --> 01:22:27.036
Hey, chef, there's a girl out
back who's here to see you.


858
01:22:27.106 --> 01:22:28.671
What?

859
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:31.641
I don't know. She says it's important.
She needs to talk to you.


860
01:23:33.805 --> 01:23:35.305
Hi.

861
01:23:40.646 --> 01:23:44.581
I-I drove past your
apartment a few times.


862
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:47.150
I saw you weren't there.

863
01:23:47.219 --> 01:23:50.753
I'm not living there
at the moment.


864
01:23:54.859 --> 01:23:57.299
Did you guys break up?

865
01:24:06.271 --> 01:24:08.831
Do you wanna take a walk?

866
01:24:21.019 --> 01:24:22.686
Can you say something, please?

867
01:24:22.754 --> 01:24:25.855
You're making me
really self-conscious.


868
01:24:27.158 --> 01:24:29.226
Come on.

869
01:24:29.294 --> 01:24:31.328
Let's get you home.

870
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:40.704
Come on.

871
01:24:53.818 --> 01:24:57.019
Can I come visit you sometime?

872
01:24:58.423 --> 01:25:00.457
You just did.

873
01:25:17.676 --> 01:25:21.210
Davis, I could tell her
what happened between us.


874
01:25:24.783 --> 01:25:27.016
What we did.

875
01:25:38.963 --> 01:25:41.631
I love you.

876
01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.900
More than just family.
I...


877
01:25:46.971 --> 01:25:49.138
I love you.

878
01:26:33.418 --> 01:26:35.819
What do we do about this?

879
01:26:40.392 --> 01:26:42.158
Nothing.

880
01:27:46.224 --> 01:27:48.691
Are you sure
you want me to do this?


881
01:27:54.933 --> 01:27:59.235
And if I do, that's it?

882
01:28:01.306 --> 01:28:03.473
Game on?

883
01:28:03.542 --> 01:28:05.542
You promise?

884
01:28:09.013 --> 01:28:14.918
Even if you don't like
some of what you hear?


885
01:28:14.986 --> 01:28:16.486
I told you...

886
01:28:17.889 --> 01:28:19.556
It's not about
whether I like the answers.


887
01:28:19.624 --> 01:28:22.459
It's that I get to know them.

888
01:28:22.527 --> 01:28:24.627
I get to know everything...

889
01:28:24.696 --> 01:28:26.930
from now on.

890
01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.600
Are you pussying out?

891
01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:33.937
No.

892
01:28:36.374 --> 01:28:39.041
Okay.

893
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:41.578
We'll start easy.

894
01:28:43.214 --> 01:28:46.048
Are you sexually attracted
to her?


895
01:28:49.621 --> 01:28:52.221
One lie, this game is done.

896
01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.760
Are you sexually attracted
to your cousin?


897
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.533
Yes.

898
01:29:08.339 --> 01:29:12.341
Have you thought about
what it would be like...


899
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:14.377
to sleep with her?

900
01:29:20.619 --> 01:29:23.019
A lot?

901
01:29:28.059 --> 01:29:30.459
Okay.

902
01:29:30.529 --> 01:29:32.795
That one stung a bit.

903
01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:39.402
Is it more
than physical attraction?


904
01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:45.174
Uh...

905
01:29:47.078 --> 01:29:48.578
maybe?

906
01:29:55.754 --> 01:29:57.420
I guess so, yeah.

907
01:30:02.827 --> 01:30:04.761
Do you think you'd make
a good couple?


908
01:30:07.131 --> 01:30:09.098
No.

909
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:16.172
Given the chance, if there
were no consequences,


910
01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.340
would you do anything with her?

911
01:30:23.481 --> 01:30:25.582
At one point...

912
01:30:26.651 --> 01:30:30.386
I guess so, yeah.

913
01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:37.126
But now, no.
No way.


914
01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:41.410
Are you sure you want
to be with me? Yes.


915
01:30:41.466 --> 01:30:44.400
- You have no doubts?
- No.


916
01:30:48.907 --> 01:30:52.942
Okay. Last question.

917
01:31:02.587 --> 01:31:06.255
Did you actually...

918
01:31:06.324 --> 01:31:09.425
do anything at all with her?

919
01:31:15.133 --> 01:31:16.799
No.

920
01:31:19.203 --> 01:31:21.437
No.

921
01:31:22.306 --> 01:31:24.306
Nothing.

922
01:31:48.566 --> 01:31:50.533
Okay.

923
01:31:55.106 --> 01:31:57.940
