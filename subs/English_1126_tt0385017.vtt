1
00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.708
One Day,in a town at
the edge of the world.

2
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.625
The tide went out and never returned.

3
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.167
The sea just left without warning.

4
00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:47.667
At first people were little more than puzzled.

5
00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:51.333
They continued to gossip and
fight over the same old things.

6
00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:57.917
But soon a silence
began to permeate the township.

7
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.958
A desert of unbelievable magnitude was
beginning to form before their very eyes.

8
00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:16.416
We come together as family and friends

9
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.708
to farewell him and to grieve him.

10
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.750
we think especially of you, his family

11
00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.833
Andrew, Penny, Jonathan.

12
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.666
For the loss of a
father, a father-in-law and grandfather.

13
00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:36.791
Part of our grief may
be regret for things done

14
00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:38.833
or left undone.

15
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.125
words said...

16
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.083
...or words never said.

17
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:54.958
Yes?

18
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.125
Is Andrew there?

19
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.916
You must be Paul.

20
00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.666
Please, come in.

21
00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.166
I'm Penny.

22
00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:12.416
- Hi,Penny.
- Andrew's wife.


23
00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.666
Ah, they're in here.

24
00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:23.500
Andrew?

25
00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:30.958
Sorry...

26
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.750
My plane was delayed in Hong Kong.

27
00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:38.416
Paul?

28
00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:43.083
Thanks.

29
00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:45.416
- Andrew?
- Thanks.


30
00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.416
Jonathan.

31
00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:02.833
So, how's London?
Is that where you're based?


32
00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.875
Actually I'm spending more
time in Istanbul these days.

33
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.416
Oh Jesus, fuck it,
my balance is completely... fuck.

34
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:17.083
It's fine, really.

35
00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:25.791
You have a nice place. 
You've done well.

36
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:30.791
I'll get Penny to make up
a bed in a spare room.

37
00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:33.375
- No that's fine. I made reservations from London.
No,really,it's no trouble.


38
00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.625
No it's done. Andrew it's done. Thank you.

39
00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:42.333
So...

40
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.041
He's gone.

41
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:48.000
Yeah.

42
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:38.416
Paul, wait!

43
00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:41.416
Paul, wait!

44
00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.374
Paul, come back!

45
00:05:44.874 --> 00:05:46.666
Paul, don't leave!

46
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:50.624
Paul!

47
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.249
Andrew!

48
00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.291
Shit!The lawyers.

49
00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:30.208
Oh fuck!Sorry.

50
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:33.333
Sorry, I wanted to be there.

51
00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:36.541
Slept in. How did it go?

52
00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:40.374
He left you a third.

53
00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:44.041
Well... you deserve two thirds.

54
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.249
He left me a third as well.

55
00:06:53.916 --> 00:06:55.583
And the rest?

56
00:06:56.708 --> 00:07:00.416
He left it to a charity.

57
00:07:08.124 --> 00:07:10.166
Listen, I need to move on this,

58
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:13.583
We need to clear the orchard and the cottage.
I can't wait around, Paul.


59
00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.916
I made an appointment for you
to see the lawyer on Tuesday.

60
00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:16.749
Well, I'll drop by and see him later.

61
00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:21.416
You can't just drop by and see

62
00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:24.541
you can't just drop
by and see them, Paul.

63
00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:25.583
Right.

64
00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.791
Hey you know what?

65
00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958
Another job came through. So

66
00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:33.499
I'm leaving, tomorrow.

67
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:42.166
Well you obviously have more important things.

68
00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:44.208
I'll see you in another 17 years.

69
00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:45.249
Come on Andrew, don't be such an old

70
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.041
Come on Andew, don't what?

71
00:07:47.124 --> 00:07:49.249
How long have you
been here, Paul? Two days?

72
00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:51.874
Forget the fact that this
all just leaves me and

73
00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:53.958
you're just like when mum died.

74
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:54.666
Oh leave mum the
fuck out of it, Andrew.

75
00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:56.749
At least have the decency to do that.

76
00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:57.791
Decency?

77
00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.124
You think you're the one being decent?

78
00:08:00.374 --> 00:08:04.083
Swanning in here like some
bloody film star with your accent?

79
00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:07.166
You know nothing about me, Andrew.

80
00:08:11.374 --> 00:08:14.833
Listen, he would have
wanted you to have these.

81
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.416
I almost forgot.

82
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:24.666
They handed me this at the council meeting.

83
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:26.749
You dropped it at the
pub the afternoon of the service.

84
00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:29.374
It could be useful getting home.

85
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:33.916
You didn't have to lie to me, Paul.

86
00:08:36.874 --> 00:08:39.374
We weren't expecting you in the first place.

87
00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:21.999
That's good wine you're spilling.

88
00:13:24.749 --> 00:13:26.624
How did you find this place?

89
00:13:26.832 --> 00:13:27.665
I heard music.

90
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.415
Mom doesn't know about this place?

91
00:13:33.499 --> 00:13:35.499
No, she doesn't.

92
00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:44.457
It's OK.

93
00:13:44.832 --> 00:13:46.415
You can stay.

94
00:14:19.415 --> 00:14:21.165
One day in a town
at the edge of the world.

95
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.290
The tide went out and never returned.

96
00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.415
When do you think you'll learn?

97
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.457
As soon as we get these blood samples
back and the swabs, a couple of days.

98
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:43.749
I've extended my trip. 
I'll sort the house out.

99
00:14:53.082 --> 00:14:54.499
Paul

100
00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:57.665
Thanks.

101
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.915
Green tea.

102
00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.957
What's he doing down there?

103
00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:21.499
There's been an outbreak of some virus. 
I'm praying they're okay.

104
00:15:25.665 --> 00:15:27.165
He cares about you, Paul.

105
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:29.249
He never told Jonathan about me.

106
00:15:31.957 --> 00:15:34.665
We each have our own
way of dealing with things.

107
00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:41.540
I can't believe how
much you look like mum.

108
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.373
Who is she?

109
00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:24.582
That's hope.

110
00:16:31.332 --> 00:16:33.082
Is she crying?

111
00:16:33.998 --> 00:16:35.790
She's thinking.

112
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.873
About what?

113
00:16:43.415 --> 00:16:45.248
Many things.

114
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.748
Turin Brakes "Full Of Stars"

115
00:17:26.873 --> 00:17:28.415
Jesus!

116
00:17:28.998 --> 00:17:30.665
What are you doing here?

117
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.165
It's just a place that I found
that no one else comes to, I just...

118
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.873
Did he let you come here?

119
00:17:40.082 --> 00:17:40.915
No.

120
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.248
No one knows that I come here.

121
00:17:46.248 --> 00:17:47.998
I should probably go.

122
00:17:48.332 --> 00:17:49.040
Yeah, I think you should.

123
00:17:50.498 --> 00:17:53.498
I'll give you a couple of minutes
to get your shit together and get out.

124
00:19:26.873 --> 00:19:36.533
Look who it is

125
00:19:31.456 --> 00:19:32.956
Paulie!

126
00:19:33.748 --> 00:19:36.498
- Paulie Prior?
- Hey, Winnie.


127
00:19:41.831 --> 00:19:42.498
How are you doing?

128
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.248
I was looking for you
at the service and I thought

129
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.831
I bet the little bugger is here somewhere. 
And I dont' even recognize him.

130
00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:52.206
Ah no I had some complications.

131
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.373
Oh that's a shame.
Hey you remember Pat.


132
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:59.206
Pat, look, look who it is. It's Paulie

133
00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:01.665
Miss Seager!

134
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:03.665
Well, well...

135
00:20:05.665 --> 00:20:06.415
Hey, Paul.

136
00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.498
I had no idea you were still here.

137
00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:11.123
What? you thought I'd dropped
off the face of the earth?

138
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.081
And he even has
the fancy bloomin plummy accent.

139
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:27.206
War zones.

140
00:20:27.748 --> 00:20:29.665
From the genocide in Ruwanda

141
00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:32.581
to the ceaseless fighting in the Middle East

142
00:20:32.706 --> 00:20:35.290
and the horrors of the Bosnian conflict.

143
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.956
War zones have been both home and work

144
00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:40.956
for the last decade to the
man you are about to meet.

145
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.873
A man whose dedication and courage

146
00:20:42.998 --> 00:20:46.248
has gained him an international
reputation of the highest merit.

147
00:20:46.873 --> 00:20:49.165
Not to mention

148
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.581
the numerous awards he has received
for both his articles and photographs,

149
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.331
and that he is an
old dear student of mine

150
00:20:55.581 --> 00:20:57.998
who I taught in these very buildings.

151
00:20:58.748 --> 00:21:00.998
I present to you Paul Prior.

152
00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:13.790
Thank you.

153
00:21:13.956 --> 00:21:16.915
That was a very generous introduction, Miss Seagar.

154
00:21:18.206 --> 00:21:20.665
Yeah, my school reports were never that good.

155
00:21:23.873 --> 00:21:26.248
The truth is that

156
00:21:26.706 --> 00:21:28.790
I've been called many things,

157
00:21:28.915 --> 00:21:31.915
many worse things since I
last stepped foot in this building

158
00:21:33.956 --> 00:21:36.498
vulture, parasite,leech

159
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.165
And it's amazing how insults in
most languages sound pretty much the same.

160
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.790
I was once

161
00:21:49.581 --> 00:21:54.206
held captive for three
days and publicly urinated on.

162
00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:58.456
I don't really know what to say,

163
00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:02.040
but I'd be happy to answer
any questions that you might have.

164
00:22:46.664 --> 00:22:48.789
He was a finalist for the Pulitzer

165
00:22:49.998 --> 00:22:52.373
Pulitzer? What the hell is that?

166
00:22:52.664 --> 00:22:54.623
It's a huge prize.

167
00:22:55.164 --> 00:22:57.831
He had a one in three
chance of winning it as well.

168
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:06.248
How do you know this shit?

169
00:23:06.373 --> 00:23:07.498
I read an interview.

170
00:23:07.748 --> 00:23:09.831
Sounds like a lone wolf.

171
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:14.706
That reminds me, 
I'm thinking of getting a tattoo.

172
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:16.956
A little unicorn, right here.

173
00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:19.581
Why?

174
00:23:19.706 --> 00:23:21.456
Steve has exactly the same one?

175
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:23.539
No I just think it would be cool.

176
00:23:27.956 --> 00:23:30.164
So anyway.

177
00:23:31.873 --> 00:23:34.164
How'd it go with Jake?

178
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:35.956
Piss off.

179
00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:36.998
Tell me!

180
00:23:40.373 --> 00:23:41.748
Well...

181
00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:44.789
first of all we had
a moonlight stroll down the beach

182
00:23:45.248 --> 00:23:47.331
and a candle light dinner

183
00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:50.248
and then he told me
what beautiful eyes I had.

184
00:23:50.498 --> 00:23:51.039
Really?

185
00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:52.789
No, you dyke.

186
00:23:53.831 --> 00:23:56.414
He only got drinks to
go on the Big Day Out.

187
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:59.039
You know he was like

188
00:23:59.206 --> 00:24:02.289
Yo man. Yo bitch.

189
00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:07.331
And I think it
should be quite so obvious.

190
00:24:10.414 --> 00:24:13.039
I was reading the local rag today.

191
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:18.914
Front page.

192
00:24:21.248 --> 00:24:22.998
Oh God.

193
00:24:23.748 --> 00:24:26.248
I'd forgotten how quiet is, really.

194
00:24:27.373 --> 00:24:30.748
I've had this bloody ringing in
my ears ever since I got here.

195
00:24:32.164 --> 00:24:34.373
Maybe the change here will do you good.

196
00:24:35.164 --> 00:24:38.081
Like I said, if you
ever get bored photographing war.

197
00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:45.373
You weren't being serious, were you?

198
00:24:46.539 --> 00:24:48.831
I'm three staff down, Paul.

199
00:24:49.831 --> 00:24:51.748
I know it might sound desperate, but

200
00:24:51.873 --> 00:24:55.081
Pat, I'd be hopeless, 
I've never taught in my life. Come on.

201
00:24:55.206 --> 00:24:58.539
You went out and made something of yourself. 
What can beat that?

202
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:03.498
Half these kids don't even know what's
on the other side of those hills.

203
00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:29.123
Paul!

204
00:25:45.581 --> 00:25:47.373
Paul gave Jonathan this.

205
00:25:48.206 --> 00:25:50.289
It's got a good zoom lens.

206
00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:55.498
It's much, much too kind.

207
00:25:55.914 --> 00:25:56.539
No, it's fine.

208
00:25:56.664 --> 00:25:58.456
Honestly, I'm using digital these days.

209
00:25:58.581 --> 00:26:01.414
If you're going to be a serious
photographer, you need a good zoom lens.

210
00:26:07.956 --> 00:26:09.664
See you tomorrow then.

211
00:26:17.872 --> 00:26:19.581
Goodnight. Paul.

212
00:26:19.664 --> 00:26:20.914
Goodnight.

213
00:26:28.914 --> 00:26:31.539
Jonathan said he gave
a talk at the school.

214
00:26:32.914 --> 00:26:35.289
Apparently the kids really liked him.

215
00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:39.206
Good.

216
00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:54.622
Can I fuck you now?

217
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:56.497
God! You've got a way with words!

218
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:01.622
Sorry, what do you want to do then?

219
00:28:06.914 --> 00:28:08.206
What you all doing man?

220
00:28:08.372 --> 00:28:09.664
Just playing.

221
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:17.581
Just play carefully.

222
00:28:19.706 --> 00:28:22.456
Shit! Fuck you!

223
00:28:24.872 --> 00:28:27.081
You were meant to stay still.

224
00:28:59.122 --> 00:29:00.872
You look well.

225
00:29:01.622 --> 00:29:03.914
Well, used more like it.

226
00:29:04.997 --> 00:29:06.331
It's different.

227
00:29:06.456 --> 00:29:08.206
You have an accent. So English.

228
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:09.247
You think?

229
00:29:10.247 --> 00:29:12.164
Well, it was inevitable.

230
00:29:12.247 --> 00:29:14.206
Sick of being called an Australian.

231
00:29:14.331 --> 00:29:15.247
Fair enough.

232
00:29:16.331 --> 00:29:17.706
Help yourself.

233
00:29:17.914 --> 00:29:18.747
Oh no, I quit.

234
00:29:22.331 --> 00:29:22.956
Kids?

235
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:25.039
Two.

236
00:29:25.122 --> 00:29:26.747
One of each.

237
00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:28.789
Remember Ben?

238
00:29:29.081 --> 00:29:30.247
Ben Steimer.

239
00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:32.872
Yeah.

240
00:29:33.747 --> 00:29:36.622
We got together about
18 months after you left.

241
00:29:36.747 --> 00:29:39.622
He died when Elvis was five.

242
00:29:39.706 --> 00:29:41.206
Motobike.

243
00:29:41.497 --> 00:29:42.247
I'm sorry.

244
00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:47.955
I was pregnant with Sam at the time.

245
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.205
So I had the kids to think
about and decided to keep the business running.

246
00:29:52.455 --> 00:29:53.955
What was that?

247
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.580
Butchery.

248
00:29:55.664 --> 00:29:58.080
Shortest butcher in New Zealand.

249
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.122
Really?

250
00:30:03.205 --> 00:30:05.122
Yeah well, I'm a
ninja with a boning knife.

251
00:30:05.205 --> 00:30:07.330
No surprises there.

252
00:30:11.497 --> 00:30:14.205
I see your brother from time to time.

253
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.289
Yeah, he's up to his neck in ostriches.

254
00:30:20.705 --> 00:30:22.830
Is he still married? 
I never see his wife.

255
00:30:22.955 --> 00:30:26.247
No, yeah, I don't
think she goes out much

256
00:30:42.914 --> 00:30:45.955
How many times have I told you
about leaving the gate to the pen open?

257
00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:08.789
If you think you're going
to see this again you're mistaken.

258
00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:16.122
You disgust me.

259
00:31:19.664 --> 00:31:21.330
Who the hell is this guy?

260
00:31:22.039 --> 00:31:24.080
Just an old school friend. 
It's no big deal.

261
00:31:24.414 --> 00:31:25.122
No big deal?

262
00:31:25.247 --> 00:31:27.122
Where's my jacket?

263
00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:29.664
Celia, It's rubbish night.

264
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.539
And please tie the bags. 
I don't want dogs getting into them. Bye, bye.

265
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.830
Hey, we'll be waiting.

266
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.997
Need a hand with that?

267
00:31:44.247 --> 00:31:46.205
Done your homework?

268
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:50.747
Will you please take your foot away?

269
00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:54.039
What? Just to see
if you've done your homework.

270
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:56.914
Just asking.

271
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:05.789
I'm sure we used to
be able to do this.

272
00:32:26.622 --> 00:32:28.289
Did you think of me?

273
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:33.039
I was terrified of seeing you.

274
00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.247
You remember those poems and
stories you used to write?

275
00:32:52.664 --> 00:32:55.622
I was going to put
music to them, release an album.

276
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:58.330
What were we were going to call ourselves?

277
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.205
What was it? Was it "silly bastards"?

278
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.164
"Stupid Buggers"

279
00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:12.872
"Sick Motherfuckers", "Sick Fuckers", wasn't it?

280
00:33:14.872 --> 00:33:17.122
"Sick Puppy", actually.

281
00:33:20.372 --> 00:33:22.455
Live at the Hammersmith.

282
00:33:23.663 --> 00:33:28.372
Yeah, see that's me. 
Eight years behind what was going on. 
But, you know,

283
00:33:29.622 --> 00:33:32.955
still thinking I had
created it all for myself.

284
00:35:27.455 --> 00:35:28.830
Hi.

285
00:35:29.038 --> 00:35:33.205
I've got an assignment where I have
to interview an important local community member.

286
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:39.122
And it was a choice between you and
Mr Aiken who set up the irrigation main.

287
00:35:39.413 --> 00:35:41.997
I was just wondering
if I could interview you?

288
00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.288
Can I come in?

289
00:36:09.163 --> 00:36:10.913
Is there real coffee?

290
00:36:14.247 --> 00:36:16.122
Sure. How do you have it?

291
00:36:17.247 --> 00:36:19.372
Macchito, thanks.

292
00:36:29.205 --> 00:36:31.413
I'm Celia by the way.

293
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.913
I gather you do have some questions.

294
00:36:50.996 --> 00:36:52.663
Ah Yes. Ah Yeah.

295
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.913
So, how did you get
to do what you do?

296
00:36:59.163 --> 00:37:01.455
I was working for a
paper in London on local articles,

297
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:03.621
and they needed somebody to go to Bosnia.

298
00:37:03.705 --> 00:37:06.746
That right, yeah. 
You were working as a typesetter in Wellington,

299
00:37:07.413 --> 00:37:08.996
and you studied journalism in London,

300
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:11.830
and found your break
as a feature article writer,

301
00:37:11.913 --> 00:37:14.205
and then a field journalist for Reuters.

302
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.330
And for the past three and a
half years you've been solidly freelance living

303
00:37:17.455 --> 00:37:19.830
between London, 
Istanbul and Paris.

304
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.913
Well done. Yes. That's it.

305
00:37:22.371 --> 00:37:24.663
You've really done your homework.

306
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.705
People must worry about you a
lot doing this kind of work.

307
00:37:29.788 --> 00:37:31.163
Your wife? Children?

308
00:37:31.871 --> 00:37:33.246
No, not married.

309
00:37:35.163 --> 00:37:37.038
Single? Yes.

310
00:37:38.538 --> 00:37:40.580
What's it like going to war? 
Just to watch?

311
00:37:40.705 --> 00:37:43.621
I'm not there to watch. 
I'm there to record.

312
00:37:43.746 --> 00:37:47.371
Is that how you got those scars?

313
00:37:50.788 --> 00:37:54.205
I fell off my bike when I
was 12 coming down a gravel track.

314
00:37:54.746 --> 00:37:56.746
No other scars?

315
00:38:01.288 --> 00:38:03.246
Are you going to drink your macchito?

316
00:38:12.205 --> 00:38:14.788
What's the hardest thing
you have to deal with?

317
00:38:14.913 --> 00:38:17.288
Jesus. Are these going to get any easier?

318
00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:22.746
I don't know, finding a loo when you
need one,which always seems to be pretty fucking impossible.

319
00:38:35.455 --> 00:38:38.288
Why don't you celebrate your birthday on Christmas?

320
00:38:40.996 --> 00:38:43.246
Now tell me, which article
did you read that one in?

321
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.163
It was your birthday when you
took that photo of that girl.

322
00:38:46.246 --> 00:38:47.580
The one you won the Pulitzer for.

323
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.663
I was shortlisted.

324
00:38:49.746 --> 00:38:52.830
I read that when you got nominated

325
00:38:54.163 --> 00:38:56.121
you withdrew the entry.

326
00:38:56.246 --> 00:38:57.746
Long story.

327
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.621
I've got a 120 minute tape.

328
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:19.913
I was in Grozny

329
00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:24.121
I heard about an offensive that
was being mounted against the Russians.

330
00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:27.663
I was warned by some
friends not to write about it

331
00:39:27.788 --> 00:39:30.246
in case the Russians caught whiff
about what was going to happen.

332
00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:31.121
So what did you do?

333
00:39:31.413 --> 00:39:32.580
Wrote the article.

334
00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:36.038
Then I declined sending it through to Reuters.

335
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.038
They found out anyway.

336
00:39:39.163 --> 00:39:42.996
And they retaliated by massacring over 100
civilians in the village outside the city.

337
00:39:45.413 --> 00:39:48.288
.And I'd been out all night drinking with
people who were killed a few hours later.

338
00:39:48.413 --> 00:39:50.538
The girl in the photo was the

339
00:39:51.205 --> 00:39:53.205
was the only survivor.

340
00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:54.580
Did you know her?

341
00:39:55.038 --> 00:39:55.621
No.

342
00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.580
Was there anyone else around?

343
00:39:59.913 --> 00:40:01.121
Not at the time, no.

344
00:40:01.496 --> 00:40:02.288
Just you?

345
00:40:02.538 --> 00:40:03.538
Just me.

346
00:40:05.788 --> 00:40:07.830
So then what?

347
00:40:11.704 --> 00:40:14.204
I think your batteries are running flat.

348
00:40:23.996 --> 00:40:25.538
Are you...

349
00:40:25.954 --> 00:40:28.246
Are you Ben Steimer's daughter?

350
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:30.204
Did you know him?

351
00:40:30.788 --> 00:40:32.288
Yeah, we went to school together.

352
00:40:38.454 --> 00:40:39.621
It's a photo of a baby.

353
00:40:39.788 --> 00:40:40.663
Whose?

354
00:40:41.204 --> 00:40:42.704
I don't know. Do I need to?

355
00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:44.246
Yeah, look at the bracelet.

356
00:40:49.038 --> 00:40:52.538
No, look! "Celia, 27/2/87".

357
00:40:52.788 --> 00:40:55.454
That's roughly 8 months after I left.

358
00:41:03.996 --> 00:41:05.246
I sent that photo nearly 16 years ago.

359
00:41:05.538 --> 00:41:06.829
Why did you send it?

360
00:41:12.163 --> 00:41:14.121
Why did you send it, Jax?

361
00:41:18.204 --> 00:41:20.163
You want an explanation?

362
00:41:23.996 --> 00:41:26.579
Do you know what's it
like to be invisible, Paul?

363
00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:30.288
Even just a postcard.

364
00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.871
A phone call.

365
00:41:35.371 --> 00:41:38.496
Hi Sid, up there next to the porkers.

366
00:41:39.538 --> 00:41:44.746
Patti Smith "Free Money"

367
00:41:54.038 --> 00:41:55.954
It's in the past. OK?

368
00:41:56.538 --> 00:41:58.621
Just leave it.

369
00:42:12.704 --> 00:42:14.329
Will you be needing a copy of that?

370
00:42:14.788 --> 00:42:15.913
No, thank you.

371
00:43:17.121 --> 00:43:19.996
Oh my god. I think I
need rescuing from these TV blokes.

372
00:43:20.996 --> 00:43:22.829
Is it a good book, is it?

373
00:43:23.204 --> 00:43:25.996
"The Cloud of Unknowing", 
Sounds mysterious.

374
00:43:27.163 --> 00:43:28.788
Where are you from?

375
00:43:29.038 --> 00:43:31.038
Where am I from?

376
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:34.329
A long way from here.

377
00:43:34.538 --> 00:43:36.871
Me too. Mind if I join you?

378
00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:42.537
Want a drink?

379
00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:43.579
I'd love one.

380
00:44:06.579 --> 00:44:08.246
Kiss me.

381
00:45:17.454 --> 00:45:18.746
Am I warm?

382
00:45:23.912 --> 00:45:25.412
Getting closer.

383
00:45:25.579 --> 00:45:26.454
Warmer?

384
00:45:26.579 --> 00:45:27.621
Getting warmer.

385
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:28.871
Warmer?

386
00:45:29.746 --> 00:45:31.162
Warmer, in springtime.

387
00:45:31.412 --> 00:45:32.204
Here!

388
00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:59.954
Alone we are born

389
00:46:00.246 --> 00:46:02.079
And die alone

390
00:46:03.037 --> 00:46:07.121
Yet see the red-gold cirrus
Over snow mountain shine


391
00:46:08.287 --> 00:46:10.329
Upon the upland road

392
00:46:10.454 --> 00:46:12.662
Ride easy, stranger

393
00:46:13.579 --> 00:46:15.787
Surrender to the sky, your heart of anger

394
00:46:20.371 --> 00:46:22.871
Don't be frightened of possibilities, son.

395
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:25.496
She's a wonderful mistress.

396
00:47:08.787 --> 00:47:10.287
It's ok.

397
00:47:10.537 --> 00:47:12.579
It's ok.

398
00:47:22.412 --> 00:47:24.120
It's ok.

399
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:35.412
It's ok.

400
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.370
Go back to sleep.

401
00:48:18.287 --> 00:48:21.204
I'm helping out for a couple of weeks.

402
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.829
And I'm new at this,
so be patient with me.

403
00:48:26.162 --> 00:48:28.787
Who knows how many words
there are in the English language?

404
00:48:28.912 --> 00:48:29.870
10 thousand.

405
00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:30.912
10 thousand.

406
00:48:33.787 --> 00:48:37.162
Dictionary. There's actually over 750,000 words.

407
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.704
And I was a 
- I thought maybe you could all choose a word.

408
00:48:41.079 --> 00:48:43.870
Any word, doesn't matter what. 
Preferably something that means something to you.

409
00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:46.454
And compose something on this word.

410
00:48:46.912 --> 00:48:50.704
Anything. It could be just a static
image of you if you think that's easier.

411
00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:54.662
Just so I get an
idea of who you all are.

412
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:57.287
And what the F
- I've gotten myself into.

413
00:50:08.495 --> 00:50:10.204
Hope.

414
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:13.370
Her mind is a graveyard. 
Her heart is an island.

415
00:50:16.579 --> 00:50:19.787
She and I are not good friends
but I've known her all my life.

416
00:50:24.662 --> 00:50:27.537
She sits in my belly hollow and distant.

417
00:50:27.954 --> 00:50:31.579
And her whispered words of
encouragement will never comfort me.

418
00:50:33.662 --> 00:50:35.120
Mom?

419
00:50:43.787 --> 00:50:46.995
I'm on to her tricks. 
Her false promises.

420
00:50:47.953 --> 00:50:51.495
"Go away", I tell her.
"I'm busy today. " I've got things to do. "


421
00:50:54.453 --> 00:50:57.328
This acquaintance never knows when to leave.

422
00:50:58.578 --> 00:51:02.120
It's not a question of why
she befriended me in the first place.

423
00:51:04.078 --> 00:51:07.328
It's more a question of why
I choose to let her stay.

424
00:51:33.703 --> 00:51:36.912
Tea bag! Tea bag!

425
00:51:37.203 --> 00:51:40.203
Tea bag!

426
00:51:43.495 --> 00:51:46.078
Tea bag!

427
00:51:49.745 --> 00:51:53.120
- Tea bag!
- Leave her alone, you fuckin' animal!


428
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:03.162
Tea bag! Tea bag!

429
00:53:44.953 --> 00:53:46.787
Your knee's bleeding.

430
00:53:46.912 --> 00:53:48.745
I know. I fell.

431
00:53:58.703 --> 00:54:00.662
Come on. Let's take
a look at it, then.

432
00:54:33.828 --> 00:54:35.245
Weeks passed

433
00:54:35.328 --> 00:54:38.161
and there was still
no sign of the ocean.

434
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:42.495
The people grew worried.

435
00:54:43.578 --> 00:54:46.786
It was decided to send a
small group to search for it

436
00:54:46.953 --> 00:54:49.411
in the hope of bringing it back.

437
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.078
All right attention please.

438
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.995
I would appreciate it if everyone listened.

439
00:55:04.411 --> 00:55:06.661
That includes you, Mr Brook.

440
00:55:09.786 --> 00:55:12.370
Look. Have any of
you seen Celia since yesterday?

441
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:21.495
No? Well, if she gets
in touch with any of you,

442
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.578
you know where to find me, okay?

443
00:55:23.828 --> 00:55:25.328
Thanks.

444
00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:30.786
All right. Settle down. 
We've all seen a police officer before.

445
00:55:40.411 --> 00:55:43.745
Paul? Look, Just wondering. 
Can I have a word for a second?

446
00:55:44.203 --> 00:55:45.203
I'm already late for a class.

447
00:55:45.328 --> 00:55:46.245
It won't take long.

448
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.286
Back to class.

449
00:55:56.411 --> 00:55:57.745
Paul?

450
00:55:57.828 --> 00:56:00.536
Hey, Pat, It's fine. 
I'm just helping out with something.

451
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.328
Thanks, Pat.

452
00:56:06.953 --> 00:56:09.578
Hey, did you see Celia on the weekend?

453
00:56:10.536 --> 00:56:12.120
No.

454
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:15.120
She used to visit though, right.

455
00:56:16.328 --> 00:56:18.911
She liked to drop by
most Sundays I guess, yeah.

456
00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.036
Yeah.

457
00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:24.786
She came by sometimes to borrow books.

458
00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:36.911
Liked?
Likes.


459
00:56:37.703 --> 00:56:39.828
I said likes, I think.

460
00:56:40.411 --> 00:56:43.328
Ah see cause I think
I know what Celia likes.

461
00:56:43.453 --> 00:56:46.578
I mean I've known her since she was a little kid. 
She's my daughter's best friend.

462
00:56:48.245 --> 00:56:51.953
I also know that you sent her an e-mail
on the weekend asking her to come by and visit.

463
00:56:52.578 --> 00:56:55.453
She wasn't too happy about
that from what I understand.

464
00:56:56.745 --> 00:56:58.745
You see I know this, Paul

465
00:56:58.911 --> 00:57:01.536
because Miso agreed to drop her off.

466
00:57:01.786 --> 00:57:04.411
Actually she did drop by briefly.

467
00:57:09.536 --> 00:57:11.661
It's nice out there at the orchard.

468
00:57:11.786 --> 00:57:13.995
Quiet. Private.

469
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:20.828
So why did you stay on?

470
00:57:21.703 --> 00:57:23.828
Favour for a friend.

471
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:27.995
How long did you guys go out for?

472
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.328
What?

473
00:57:29.495 --> 00:57:29.828
om

474
00:57:32.828 --> 00:57:33.911
Oh, she mentioned me.

475
00:57:34.078 --> 00:57:35.453
When did you break up?

476
00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:38.828
God, seventeen.

477
00:57:40.036 --> 00:57:40.661
Keep your leg still.

478
00:57:49.078 --> 00:57:52.036
Listen, what you wrote the other day, 
I thought it was

479
00:57:54.744 --> 00:57:56.661
well considered.

480
00:57:57.453 --> 00:58:00.119
Well considered.
Intriguing.


481
00:58:11.661 --> 00:58:13.744
I like what you've done here.

482
00:58:14.744 --> 00:58:17.036
Where did all these books come from?

483
00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:19.828
He never told me.

484
00:58:19.953 --> 00:58:21.828
Wanted to keep it a mystery, I suppose.

485
00:58:21.994 --> 00:58:24.578
Father's have got a
lot to answer for, huh?

486
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:51.369
Hey beautiful.

487
00:58:53.036 --> 00:58:54.911
Sorry I'm late.

488
00:59:15.703 --> 00:59:17.619
She can't have gone far.

489
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:28.619
Me and some mates are going
to take a look around Lawrence later.

490
00:59:30.578 --> 00:59:32.369
Can you bring those?

491
00:59:34.328 --> 00:59:35.828
Sure.

492
00:59:38.119 --> 00:59:40.994
I asked for an essay about
the pros and cons of immigration, Jake

493
00:59:41.078 --> 00:59:43.244
not the best places to surf.

494
00:59:43.411 --> 00:59:45.994
Louise, Tonga has a king, not a president.

495
00:59:47.328 --> 00:59:50.369
I think you'll find there's more to
life in Hong Kong than dance clubs, Miso.

496
00:59:50.494 --> 00:59:53.328
What? Like secret book clubs?

497
01:00:00.536 --> 01:00:02.161
Paul!

498
01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:08.703
You had nice handwriting as a kid.

499
01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.494
Sergeant O'Neil's back.

500
01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:10.994
He's waiting for you in the common room.

501
01:00:26.119 --> 01:00:28.411
Is this one of the books she borrowed?

502
01:00:29.911 --> 01:00:31.744
I didn't

503
01:00:32.869 --> 01:00:35.578
I didn't keep a record, to
tell you the truth. I didn't.

504
01:00:35.744 --> 01:00:38.244
What? Other things on your mind, did you?

505
01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:44.078
We found this on the side of
the road, bet it came from your place.

506
01:00:45.161 --> 01:00:47.828
Just want to know how
it got there, that's all.

507
01:00:51.203 --> 01:00:53.494
Did she ever talk to you about leaving?

508
01:00:54.119 --> 01:00:57.203
Name a teenager around here who doesn't.

509
01:00:57.828 --> 01:00:59.911
I know a few actually.

510
01:01:20.536 --> 01:01:23.077
Stop.

511
01:01:41.286 --> 01:01:43.369
OK. You can open your eyes.

512
01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.119
Happy Birthday.

513
01:01:56.494 --> 01:01:58.202
Who is this anyway?

514
01:01:58.577 --> 01:02:00.327
Kiri Te Kanawa. You chose it.

515
01:02:00.661 --> 01:02:01.369
Who's she?

516
01:02:01.744 --> 01:02:03.119
Who's she?

517
01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:07.202
There are people in this country who
would shoot you for asking that question.

518
01:02:07.577 --> 01:02:10.744
There are people in this country who
would shoot you for listening to it.

519
01:02:16.327 --> 01:02:18.494
So what's she singing about?

520
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:21.952
Love.

521
01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.994
What do you normally
do on a Saturday night?

522
01:02:29.077 --> 01:02:32.077
Who do you hang out with
when you're not having picnics with me?

523
01:02:32.202 --> 01:02:33.661
What do you do,
go to parties or what?

524
01:02:33.869 --> 01:02:35.411
If you can call them that.

525
01:02:35.494 --> 01:02:39.327
Why? Do you wanna come along?
You actually might get to see them tea bagging.


526
01:02:39.536 --> 01:02:41.536
Tea bagging? What's that?

527
01:02:43.161 --> 01:02:46.369
Well, That's when guys
get a girl completely comatose

528
01:02:46.494 --> 01:02:51.494
and then they take turns in lowering their
testicles into her eye sockets and film it.

529
01:02:52.327 --> 01:02:55.036
And if they're really kind they
send a copy to a paranoid friend.

530
01:02:56.244 --> 01:02:59.494
First class is seminal? 
It's not funny.

531
01:03:02.494 --> 01:03:04.202
I don't know what we're talking about.

532
01:03:04.577 --> 01:03:05.244
Oh god.

533
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.286
Well I hope you keep your distance from
those kind of guys is what I'm saying.

534
01:03:17.369 --> 01:03:20.119
So, tell me about you and
mum, back in the dark ages.

535
01:03:20.244 --> 01:03:22.536
It wasn't that long ago.

536
01:03:26.494 --> 01:03:31.911
Patti Smith "Horses"

537
01:03:49.369 --> 01:03:51.494
My mom wanted to sing like this?

538
01:03:52.619 --> 01:03:55.244
Your mother wanted to be Patti Smith.

539
01:04:47.285 --> 01:04:49.619
Come with me. Come on.

540
01:04:50.494 --> 01:04:52.160
I'll show you something.

541
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.910
Where did this place come from?

542
01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:15.577
No one knows about it
except me and my dad.

543
01:05:16.369 --> 01:05:18.119
So what are you doing here?

544
01:05:19.494 --> 01:05:20.202
Write.

545
01:05:21.244 --> 01:05:22.744
Think.

546
01:05:26.077 --> 01:05:27.910
Mystery boy.

547
01:05:28.119 --> 01:05:30.077
So many secrets.

548
01:05:36.619 --> 01:05:38.327
What are you doing?

549
01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:42.494
Giving you something to write about, moron.

550
01:05:46.994 --> 01:05:48.785
Mom the rock star.

551
01:05:48.869 --> 01:05:51.452
It's hard to believe
she even had a dream.

552
01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.702
Do you want to
know what my dream is?

553
01:05:57.077 --> 01:05:57.744
Yeah.

554
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:05.285
I'm sitting in a cafe in Spain.

555
01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:12.452
And don't know a single person there. 
And I can't understand a single word that anyone's saying.

556
01:06:14.577 --> 01:06:16.785
I've got a glass of wine

557
01:06:18.702 --> 01:06:20.827
and I can see the sea.

558
01:06:27.619 --> 01:06:28.452
Don't worry.

559
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.119
No, go on. And?

560
01:06:34.494 --> 01:06:36.285
I'm just writing.

561
01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:40.619
And yeah.

562
01:06:43.202 --> 01:06:46.577
And you know it doesn't matter if
no one ever reads what I'm writing

563
01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:49.785
I don't want to be famous.

564
01:06:50.535 --> 01:06:52.535
I just, I just want to be there.

565
01:07:00.494 --> 01:07:04.535
Anyway, I'd rather be a
no one somewhere than someone nowhere.

566
01:07:06.827 --> 01:07:08.994
I've already packed my suitcase.

567
01:07:10.452 --> 01:07:11.660
I'm not joking.

568
01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:13.327
I'm not laughing at you.

569
01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:17.869
I had a similar dream once.

570
01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:19.702
Really?

571
01:07:21.244 --> 01:07:22.827
Tell me.

572
01:07:27.494 --> 01:07:31.160
Sometimes I'd see... faces.

573
01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:38.452
At night before I fell
asleep, people I never met.

574
01:07:41.035 --> 01:07:42.619
And I'd wonder who they were.

575
01:07:44.295 --> 01:07:46.794
Where they might live, what they did.

576
01:07:48.128 --> 01:07:49.711
and it was strange

577
01:07:50.003 --> 01:07:53.169
because it was like they
knew I was thinking about them.

578
01:07:55.586 --> 01:07:58.253
Why did you become a war journalist?

579
01:08:01.336 --> 01:08:04.461
Who you set out to be
is not always who you become.

580
01:08:04.586 --> 01:08:07.169
You know, Things happen. Plans change.

581
01:08:13.211 --> 01:08:15.086
I see them too.

582
01:08:16.836 --> 01:08:18.711
Faces.

583
01:08:23.461 --> 01:08:25.128
I wanted to give you something.

584
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:36.003
Yeah, right.

585
01:08:36.336 --> 01:08:38.753
I just, I think you should enter.

586
01:09:13.128 --> 01:09:15.336
You never talk about your mum.

587
01:09:15.503 --> 01:09:17.294
My mum? She's very religious.

588
01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:21.044
She had these little sermons about the
beauty God hides away in quiet corners.

589
01:09:21.378 --> 01:09:24.044
Is that what your dad
was hiding from in here?

590
01:09:24.544 --> 01:09:26.294
No, they

591
01:09:26.753 --> 01:09:29.253
I think she was just quiet, you know.

592
01:09:30.336 --> 01:09:32.503
My dad and her were very different.

593
01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:35.294
My dad didn't believe in anything. 
He's an atheist.

594
01:09:35.461 --> 01:09:37.794
My brother and her were very close.

595
01:09:39.003 --> 01:09:41.378
I heard she had an accident.

596
01:09:42.336 --> 01:09:44.128
Yeah she did.

597
01:09:44.669 --> 01:09:47.878
She was diagnosed as bi-polar, manic depression.

598
01:09:49.003 --> 01:09:52.544
Doctors prescribed lithium but she
stopped taking it, I think.

599
01:09:53.628 --> 01:09:55.586
What happened?

600
01:09:59.211 --> 01:10:01.586
She was standing in the river

601
01:10:03.211 --> 01:10:06.503
at the back of the property and she
pointed up to this hawk in the sky.

602
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:09.044
And then when I
looked back she was gone.

603
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:11.711
Found the body two days later, I think

604
01:10:17.336 --> 01:10:19.878
Is that why you push people away?

605
01:10:25.794 --> 01:10:29.336
I do as I fuckin' please Celia. 
You know I hate to spoil your illusions.

606
01:10:31.086 --> 01:10:34.003
But the world out there isn't a
bed of roses waiting to be picked

607
01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:38.294
or whatever it was you said, a
glass of chardonnay in a fuckin' tapas bar.

608
01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:40.544
You understand?

609
01:10:40.753 --> 01:10:42.419
It wasn't an insult.

610
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:50.378
Sorry.

611
01:10:54.961 --> 01:10:56.461
OK.

612
01:11:09.628 --> 01:11:11.336
Hey, Jax.

613
01:11:12.253 --> 01:11:13.711
Hi

614
01:11:14.544 --> 01:11:16.377
I saw the smoke and
I didn't want to disturb you

615
01:11:16.627 --> 01:11:18.461
but I remembered it was
your birthday and so I

616
01:11:33.461 --> 01:11:35.169
Get in the car

617
01:11:36.544 --> 01:11:37.419
No.

618
01:11:37.586 --> 01:11:38.961
Celia, I'm sick of this.

619
01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:42.127
I said get in the car. 
I said get in the car

620
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:47.211
You have no right
to be here. Night, Paul.

621
01:11:55.419 --> 01:11:58.336
You have the audacity to
bring here and give her alcohol?

622
01:11:58.419 --> 01:12:01.002
Jax, it's not what you think.

623
01:12:05.752 --> 01:12:08.461
You even presume to know what I think?

624
01:12:22.752 --> 01:12:24.211
Shit!

625
01:12:26.002 --> 01:12:26.752
Excuse me.

626
01:12:28.086 --> 01:12:32.252
I need a notebook. 
I know it's here somewhere.

627
01:12:35.711 --> 01:12:36.336
Sorry, dad.

628
01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:38.419
There's nothing to be sorry for

629
01:12:39.086 --> 01:12:41.086
as long as you're being cautious.

630
01:12:41.169 --> 01:12:42.794
Yeah of course.

631
01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:46.294
I'll be on my way.

632
01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.877
You shouldn't be here.

633
01:12:56.961 --> 01:12:58.877
He doesn't care.

634
01:12:59.002 --> 01:13:01.169
I mean you saw for yourself.

635
01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:02.419
I care.

636
01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:03.961
What are you telling me?

637
01:13:04.086 --> 01:13:07.211
That I'm not as important as
what goes on in your head?

638
01:13:08.169 --> 01:13:10.794
There's just parts of me you can't have.

639
01:13:12.336 --> 01:13:14.002
No one can.

640
01:13:22.836 --> 01:13:24.919
Hey. You ok?

641
01:13:28.627 --> 01:13:31.086
I'd rather look at it at your place.

642
01:13:36.252 --> 01:13:38.294
What's this?

643
01:13:42.002 --> 01:13:43.919
Jesus Christ.

644
01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:46.419
Did she do this?

645
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:48.961
Celia tell me, who did it?

646
01:13:50.544 --> 01:13:52.919
I don't want to talk about it. 
It wasn't mom.

647
01:13:57.877 --> 01:13:58.752
Hey where is he?

648
01:13:58.919 --> 01:14:00.086
Paul, what are you doing?

649
01:14:00.294 --> 01:14:01.502
Paul, what are you doing in my house?

650
01:14:01.877 --> 01:14:02.836
Where is he, Jackie?

651
01:14:03.002 --> 01:14:03.461
What's going on?

652
01:14:03.627 --> 01:14:04.502
Is this the asshole?

653
01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:05.711
What? Who the fuck is this?

654
01:14:05.752 --> 01:14:07.169
Shut the fuck up, Gareth!

655
01:14:07.294 --> 01:14:08.252
Paul, would you leave?

656
01:14:08.336 --> 01:14:08.877
So this is the famous Paul.

657
01:14:11.086 --> 01:14:14.211
You like beating up little girls, do you. 
You know it's assault, is what it is.

658
01:14:14.419 --> 01:14:15.961
You touch her again. 
I'll kill you.

659
01:14:16.502 --> 01:14:18.044
Is that right, mate?

660
01:14:18.127 --> 01:14:20.752
What do you call this, dickhead?

661
01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:22.252
I always mind my own fuckin' business.

662
01:14:26.169 --> 01:14:28.794
Get out of my house, you fuckin' pricks.

663
01:14:35.294 --> 01:14:37.086
Mind your fuckin' business.

664
01:14:38.044 --> 01:14:41.252
You cunt, you fuck off!
Is that clear?


665
01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.835
Still wanna fuckin' kill me, cunt?

666
01:14:44.835 --> 01:14:44.870
Gareth, Get the fuck inside.

667
01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.835
Get the fuck inside!

668
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.335
You think you can come here and
do this shit in front of my kids?

669
01:14:53.752 --> 01:14:55.877
Have you seen her fuckin' bruises? 
What did you think I was going to do?

670
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.585
She got a lot more than she got. 
I want you to stay away from her.

671
01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:01.460
You changed the birth certificate.

672
01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:03.919
When were you going
to tell her about that?

673
01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.169
Just stay out of our lives, all right?

674
01:15:13.377 --> 01:15:15.085
Yeah.

675
01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:17.835
See you around Paul, you fuckin' prick.

676
01:15:25.127 --> 01:15:26.544
Hello?

677
01:15:26.794 --> 01:15:28.335
Hello?

678
01:15:29.544 --> 01:15:31.127
Hello?

679
01:15:32.585 --> 01:15:34.335
Celia?

680
01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:51.585
She might have gone to Spain.

681
01:15:53.877 --> 01:15:55.335
No, no, no, wait.

682
01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.210
My daughter plans on running off
to Spain and he sees nothing.

683
01:15:58.294 --> 01:15:59.585
I don't call that irrelevant.

684
01:15:59.794 --> 01:16:02.085
Come on Jackie, it's not like it's
the first time she's done something like this.

685
01:16:02.169 --> 01:16:03.669
Oh great.

686
01:16:04.335 --> 01:16:07.002
How good, this is good. 
So you are defending him now?

687
01:16:08.585 --> 01:16:11.419
Okay, so when exactly did she
say she was running off to Spain?

688
01:16:11.502 --> 01:16:14.460
She didn't. She didn't say. 
All I knew is she had the ticket.

689
01:16:14.544 --> 01:16:17.044
I thought she was going to
leave when school was finished. That's all.

690
01:16:17.127 --> 01:16:18.960
I didn't know what to think.

691
01:16:19.085 --> 01:16:21.835
Yeah well I know what I think. 
I think you are out of your mind.

692
01:16:22.252 --> 01:16:24.919
She made me promise
not to tell a soul.

693
01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:27.419
I'm her mother.

694
01:16:27.544 --> 01:16:29.169
OK?

695
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.294
When exactly did she make this promise Paul?

696
01:16:32.419 --> 01:16:34.210
Was it when you
were plying her with alcohol?

697
01:16:34.335 --> 01:16:36.752
I wasn't plying her with alcohol. 
I gave her a glass, Jackie. 
A child could have drunk it.

698
01:16:36.835 --> 01:16:37.710
A child did drink it.

699
01:16:39.335 --> 01:16:41.252
Oh yeah. And did he think of that
when he was punching the shit out of her?

700
01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:42.294
And the rest.

701
01:16:42.419 --> 01:16:44.085
Fuck off. Don't bring me into it.

702
01:16:44.169 --> 01:16:44.835
Sneaking up on her.

703
01:16:45.002 --> 01:16:46.919
Pissing in the toilet while
she was lying in the bath.

704
01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:50.294
If it took her going half way around the
world to get away from you, you fuckin' a-.

705
01:16:53.627 --> 01:16:54.460
You two stay in here.

706
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:56.669
You, get in my office. 
I want a word alone.

707
01:16:59.794 --> 01:17:01.835
What's he talking about?

708
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.669
What the fuck is he talking about

709
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.752
Nothing!

710
01:17:08.752 --> 01:17:11.544
Tell me about the last
time you saw her. Everything.

711
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:13.585
We were at the gate. 
She was carrying the atlas.

712
01:17:13.752 --> 01:17:14.919
She said goodbye and she left.

713
01:17:15.002 --> 01:17:15.960
No special goodbyes?

714
01:17:16.044 --> 01:17:17.002
No special goodbyes.

715
01:17:17.085 --> 01:17:19.002
No, she had a couple of
books she hadn't got around to read

716
01:17:19.169 --> 01:17:20.335
and I told her she could keep them.

717
01:17:20.419 --> 01:17:21.419
Names of these books?

718
01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.960
Oh fuck say, what does
it matter? I don't know.

719
01:17:25.127 --> 01:17:27.669
"Owls Do Cry", by
Janet Frame, and another one,

720
01:17:28.294 --> 01:17:30.877
Camus, "The Outsider", 
I think it was.

721
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.460
That's Camus not canoe. C-a-m-u-s.

722
01:17:35.794 --> 01:17:37.919
You smug prick.

723
01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:40.835
Not all of us had
to run off to Europe, mate.

724
01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:17.960
Travel Diary

725
01:18:21.293 --> 01:18:23.127
passport

726
01:18:40.293 --> 01:18:42.168
"Missing girl, teacher, shared secret den"

727
01:18:42.377 --> 01:18:43.835
I guess you've seen this.

728
01:18:46.543 --> 01:18:48.877
Small town bloody gossip.

729
01:18:51.377 --> 01:18:53.752
I don't know what
to do about this, Paul.

730
01:18:55.377 --> 01:18:57.918
The board of trustees have called a meeting.

731
01:19:00.752 --> 01:19:03.668
You don't deserve this.

732
01:19:03.877 --> 01:19:04.710
You know it's fine, Pat.

733
01:19:05.002 --> 01:19:07.668
It's time I left anyway. Honestly.

734
01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:11.793
Hey! Jonathan.

735
01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:13.668
Jonathan?

736
01:19:27.668 --> 01:19:29.335
Jonathan!

737
01:19:30.793 --> 01:19:32.502
Jonathan!

738
01:19:32.668 --> 01:19:34.127
Get in!

739
01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:37.752
Jonathan, get in the car, it's bloody freezing.

740
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.543
Come on.

741
01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:43.127
Put your seat belt on.

742
01:19:48.252 --> 01:19:50.418
Were you having sex with her?

743
01:19:51.127 --> 01:19:52.793
What?

744
01:19:55.627 --> 01:19:57.627
You know who.

745
01:20:00.627 --> 01:20:02.377
Who said that?

746
01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:05.043
Who said that?

747
01:20:08.418 --> 01:20:12.585
Kids at school, said you were
giving her special coaching in bed.

748
01:20:19.627 --> 01:20:21.460
And you believed them?

749
01:20:26.085 --> 01:20:27.752
Huh, and you believed

750
01:20:36.627 --> 01:20:39.710
How's that camera going? 
I haven't seen you with it lately.

751
01:21:07.502 --> 01:21:10.835
As the days went on,
more and more people went looking.

752
01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:22.627
The people searched far and wide

753
01:21:22.793 --> 01:21:25.377
but the ocean had vanished without a trace.

754
01:21:31.252 --> 01:21:33.918
The quiet land once bountiful

755
01:21:34.085 --> 01:21:36.377
had become hard and unyielding.

756
01:21:47.126 --> 01:21:49.585
Then a shape appeared on the horizon.

757
01:21:51.626 --> 01:21:54.043
Through a blaze of hate the people saw

758
01:21:54.168 --> 01:21:57.293
what looked like tumbling water rolling towards them.

759
01:21:59.501 --> 01:22:01.418
A wave of excitement passed through the town

760
01:22:01.585 --> 01:22:04.835
as they anxiously watched the ocean return.

761
01:22:05.751 --> 01:22:07.960
But as it grew closer the
shape began to alter and mutate.

762
01:22:11.418 --> 01:22:15.585
What looked like tumbling water
was in fact wild horses.

763
01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:21.543
Everywhere they turned they saw
horses drawing closer and closer.

764
01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.960
Their excitement turned to fear.

765
01:22:26.085 --> 01:22:28.085
And their fear became panic,

766
01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:33.626
for it seemed that
nothing could stop their advance.

767
01:22:35.793 --> 01:22:38.501
Which as the ocean's disappearance

768
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:41.085
had come without warning.

769
01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.501
But then no one,

770
01:22:46.626 --> 01:22:48.585
not even for a moment,

771
01:22:48.751 --> 01:22:52.501
had stopped to question why the
ocean had left in the first place.

772
01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:10.876
Mr. Prior?

773
01:23:11.251 --> 01:23:14.376
I am Detective Inspector Farnon from Wellington CIV.

774
01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:16.460
This is Detective Dunleavy.

775
01:23:16.543 --> 01:23:18.376
I've a warrant to search these premises.

776
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.585
And I'll need you to accompany
me to the station for questioning.

777
01:23:23.585 --> 01:23:26.501
I'll need your passport
and keys to your car.

778
01:23:29.001 --> 01:23:32.543
I believe there's a shed
where Celia used to visit you.

779
01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.043
Right then, let's get you home.

780
01:24:04.001 --> 01:24:06.960
Why did Celia come
to your place last Sunday?

781
01:24:10.251 --> 01:24:11.460
Did you hear the question?

782
01:24:11.918 --> 01:24:12.501
Yes.

783
01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.335
I understand she visited you regularly.

784
01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:19.376
What was the nature of the visits?

785
01:24:19.585 --> 01:24:20.918
We talked about things.

786
01:24:21.168 --> 01:24:21.960
What things?

787
01:24:22.085 --> 01:24:23.668
Europe.

788
01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.793
Books.

789
01:24:27.501 --> 01:24:29.793
Celia wants to be a writer.

790
01:24:41.001 --> 01:24:43.585
I am not flesh. 
I am not blood.

791
01:24:43.835 --> 01:24:46.543
They can look all they
like but they'll never see me.

792
01:24:46.668 --> 01:24:50.210
If I never hear your love or
hold your hand again in this life,

793
01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:53.085
promise me we will
touch when I am dead.

794
01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:57.960
It's called 'Poem for a Lonely Friend'.

795
01:24:59.251 --> 01:25:02.001
Would you consider yourself lonely, Paul?

796
01:25:11.168 --> 01:25:12.835
Thank you.

797
01:25:13.751 --> 01:25:16.334
Would you keep that door closed, please.

798
01:25:21.793 --> 01:25:24.959
Why did Celia keep visiting you
even though her parents had forbidden it?

799
01:25:25.043 --> 01:25:26.001
Parents?

800
01:25:26.036 --> 01:25:26.959
Mother.

801
01:25:27.501 --> 01:25:29.918
I guess she saw something in me.

802
01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:32.709
And what was that?

803
01:25:33.001 --> 01:25:34.918
Well, I'm not Celia.

804
01:25:35.043 --> 01:25:38.168
Then perhaps you'd like to tell me
what it was you saw in her?

805
01:25:41.126 --> 01:25:43.376
I know this is diffi-

806
01:25:46.751 --> 01:25:48.834
I remember being her.

807
01:26:07.168 --> 01:26:08.793
What did you do this time?

808
01:26:09.251 --> 01:26:10.459
Come on, leave me alone now.

809
01:26:10.584 --> 01:26:12.168
Go away.

810
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:15.501
Just fuckin' go, come on, leave me alone.

811
01:26:15.626 --> 01:26:17.668
I don't need this shit, Celia. Just go.

812
01:26:18.043 --> 01:26:18.709
What?

813
01:26:19.876 --> 01:26:20.959
Did mom say something to you?

814
01:26:21.251 --> 01:26:23.043
Your mum threatened to ring the school, yeah.

815
01:26:23.126 --> 01:26:23.959
Okay?

816
01:26:24.168 --> 01:26:25.418
No, it's not ok.

817
01:26:26.043 --> 01:26:28.876
God, she's so fuckin' presumptuous.

818
01:26:30.293 --> 01:26:32.751
Who the fuck cares what she thinks?

819
01:26:32.918 --> 01:26:35.793
She's got a fuckin'
boyfriend he wears boat shoes.

820
01:26:35.918 --> 01:26:38.668
He brought her a pair
now they're both wearing them.

821
01:26:39.084 --> 01:26:41.751
You never see a fuckin' boat around here.

822
01:26:47.834 --> 01:26:50.001
I just came to tell
you that I entered the contest.

823
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:51.834
Well that's great, now get going.

824
01:26:52.293 --> 01:26:53.918
It's not illegal that
we're friends or something, Paul.

825
01:26:58.251 --> 01:27:01.709
It was you who said that we
shouldn't care what other people think of us.

826
01:27:09.459 --> 01:27:11.418
Or were you just saying that?

827
01:27:53.126 --> 01:27:56.293
You know how you and mom used to go
out and now it me and you that are friends.

828
01:27:59.876 --> 01:28:02.543
I feel like I've
known you my whole life.

829
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:05.001
Yeah well, it's a small world.

830
01:28:05.126 --> 01:28:07.376
It isn't a small world.

831
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:12.626
Were you guys in love?

832
01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:20.751
There must've been something going on
if you tattooed each others feet.

833
01:28:24.168 --> 01:28:26.168
It's a little hard to
imagine what you saw in her.

834
01:28:26.293 --> 01:28:29.376
Well, you're not the first person
to feel that way about their parents.

835
01:28:30.543 --> 01:28:32.959
Anyway, it's a long time ago.

836
01:28:36.001 --> 01:28:38.126
I know it wasn't planned.

837
01:28:39.043 --> 01:28:41.251
Mom was only 16.

838
01:28:48.626 --> 01:28:51.292
You'd tell me if you knew anything, eh?

839
01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:00.917
Is that a promise?

840
01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:09.001
Oh stuff it.

841
01:29:09.251 --> 01:29:11.959
Let's get wet. Come on.

842
01:29:13.417 --> 01:29:18.209
Mazzy Star "Take Everything"

843
01:29:55.876 --> 01:29:56.626
Oh, geez!

844
01:29:56.917 --> 01:29:58.709
Andrew, Jonathan?

845
01:29:58.792 --> 01:30:02.334
We were on our way home from church
and thought we'd stop in for a cuppa.

846
01:30:02.876 --> 01:30:04.459
Fuck.

847
01:30:05.417 --> 01:30:07.376
It's freezing!

848
01:30:17.292 --> 01:30:19.459
Have you see this
new thing that they're building?

849
01:30:19.584 --> 01:30:22.001
It looks like a giant barn.

850
01:30:25.084 --> 01:30:27.084
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

851
01:30:36.834 --> 01:30:38.876
I'll put the kettle on.

852
01:30:51.792 --> 01:30:53.417
Family and friends of Celia Steimer

853
01:30:53.876 --> 01:30:55.501
are doing everything possible
to help police find her.

854
01:30:55.626 --> 01:30:58.959
More than 50 volunteers are
now scouring waterways and bushlands

855
01:30:59.084 --> 01:31:00.667
in the Marshall road forest.

856
01:31:00.834 --> 01:31:03.334
The 16-year-old Rapari Junction HS student

857
01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:05.584
has been missing now
for more than a week.

858
01:31:05.751 --> 01:31:07.501
Detective Robin Farland says

859
01:31:07.584 --> 01:31:10.209
they have to consider every option.

860
01:31:10.334 --> 01:31:13.459
She acknowledged a local man
is helping them with their inquiries

861
01:31:13.667 --> 01:31:15.542
and the police will be
visiting every house in the area.

862
01:31:34.376 --> 01:31:36.126
He'll be fine.

863
01:31:37.084 --> 01:31:38.834
Let them handle it.

864
01:32:24.625 --> 01:32:25.875
Please just use an ashtray.

865
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.917
Okay.

866
01:32:28.167 --> 01:32:30.709
Listen, I spoke to the lawyer in Alexandria

867
01:32:30.834 --> 01:32:33.417
and he reckons he's handled
this sort of thing before.

868
01:32:34.584 --> 01:32:37.125
He wants you to give him
a call first thing in the morning.

869
01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:43.875
Hey, what sexual position creates the ugliest offspring?

870
01:32:47.459 --> 01:32:49.084
What sexual position creates-

871
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:50.125
I don't know, Paul.

872
01:32:51.084 --> 01:32:53.209
Ask your mother.

873
01:32:55.959 --> 01:32:58.292
Can you imagine if she saw us now?

874
01:32:58.584 --> 01:33:01.084
Can you imagine that? 
What do you think she'd say?

875
01:33:01.792 --> 01:33:04.000
Two brothers having a drink and a chat.

876
01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:06.750
What do you think? 
She'd be proud, or what?

877
01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:11.375
Why are you doing this?

878
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:12.417
Doing what?

879
01:33:12.792 --> 01:33:14.042
You know exactly what.

880
01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:16.125
Why can't you just talk to me?

881
01:33:24.042 --> 01:33:25.834
Fuck you.

882
01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:30.667
What the fuck are you looking at? 
Never seen two brothers talking before?

883
01:33:38.334 --> 01:33:40.709
You want to talk, let's talk.

884
01:33:40.834 --> 01:33:42.959
Forget the fact you
come in here blind drunk

885
01:33:43.042 --> 01:33:46.334
and interrupt a meeting but then
you just bring up mom like that?

886
01:33:46.542 --> 01:33:49.584
I mean how dare you? 
I realize you are in a spot of bother, Paul,

887
01:33:49.667 --> 01:33:52.375
but that doesn't give you
the right to behave like this.

888
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.834
The truth? You were never there for mom.

889
01:33:54.917 --> 01:33:56.959
When she was sick,
where the hell were you?

890
01:33:57.042 --> 01:33:58.917
Brilliant. So you do
have an opinion. OK Andrew.

891
01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:00.584
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? 
I couldn't get near her.

892
01:34:00.667 --> 01:34:04.167
Blame it all on me. 
I had to be you. 
Did you know that?

893
01:34:04.292 --> 01:34:06.834
You made fuckin' sure of it.

894
01:34:06.917 --> 01:34:08.875
The happy little fuckin'
threesome: Andy, mom and God.

895
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:09.667
No one else invited.

896
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:10.959
You abandoned her.

897
01:34:11.042 --> 01:34:14.459
You abandoned her, Paul. 
And you never took one single step towards-

898
01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:18.542
at least for all his faults, he
let me in. He let me in.

899
01:34:18.625 --> 01:34:22.084
You were late for his funeral, remember? 
And you're gonna stand here defending for him.

900
01:34:22.292 --> 01:34:24.875
Listen to me Paul,
you listen, listen to me.

901
01:34:26.792 --> 01:34:28.875
You know sometimes I look at you

902
01:34:28.959 --> 01:34:31.000
and all I see is him.

903
01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:34.167
Just him.

904
01:34:34.334 --> 01:34:36.542
I find that quite disheartening.

905
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:44.875
Yeah well, at least I
didn't marry my fuckin' mother.

906
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:53.792
Has she always been like that
or just when she met you?

907
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.084
Go to hell, Paul.

908
01:35:10.125 --> 01:35:14.375
Police confirm blood traces belong to missing girl.

909
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.959
Just open it!

910
01:36:52.792 --> 01:36:54.958
Celia, give me the fuckin' letter carta.

911
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:59.417
It doesn't matter.

912
01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:14.500
Open it. Will you just open it?

913
01:37:14.667 --> 01:37:15.542
No! Don't open it.

914
01:37:16.167 --> 01:37:17.042
Open it!

915
01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:18.083
I don't want to.

916
01:37:24.125 --> 01:37:24.833
No?

917
01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:25.875
No.

918
01:37:47.083 --> 01:37:49.458
Wonder who came in first?

919
01:38:01.958 --> 01:38:03.667
Amid the 2000 or so entries

920
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.750
we were delighted with Ms Steimers' story.

921
01:38:05.875 --> 01:38:08.958
This work shows an emerging
remarkable talent for someone so young.

922
01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.875
It catches a sense
of beauty, mystery and loss

923
01:38:11.958 --> 01:38:14.375
without ever losing sight of what might be.

924
01:38:14.875 --> 01:38:17.042
You wonder who came first?

925
01:38:21.250 --> 01:38:23.083
I'll tell you who came first.

926
01:38:23.208 --> 01:38:26.625
Someone three times your age, probably, someone
who bloody well deserved to come first.

927
01:38:43.458 --> 01:38:45.958
Thank you for making it special for me.

928
01:38:49.375 --> 01:38:51.125
The den and everything.

929
01:39:03.375 --> 01:39:06.417
I need a cigarette to
cope with this sort of scenery.

930
01:39:06.958 --> 01:39:08.875
In the car. I'll
be back in a tic.

931
01:39:09.125 --> 01:39:11.167
Can you leave me your jacket?

932
01:40:14.583 --> 01:40:18.541
Are you gonna be home tonight? 
I need you to baby sit Sam.

933
01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:24.708
Celia, I asked you a question.

934
01:40:40.041 --> 01:40:41.625
Fuck!

935
01:41:06.916 --> 01:41:09.000
Is he my father?

936
01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:21.708
I wish it were that simple.

937
01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.000
Hey, you!

938
01:41:38.958 --> 01:41:40.500
What's up?

939
01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:01.458
Did you know?

940
01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:04.583
Did you know?

941
01:42:05.208 --> 01:42:08.000
Answer me! Did you know?

942
01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:11.041
Oh, Celia...

943
01:42:17.083 --> 01:42:20.166
I know what you did when
you took the photo of that girl.

944
01:42:21.375 --> 01:42:23.541
You walked away and left her.

945
01:42:23.708 --> 01:42:26.791
That's why you withdrew the entry so
you wouldn't even have to deal with her.

946
01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:28.458
You don't know-

947
01:42:28.583 --> 01:42:29.500
don't!

948
01:42:31.125 --> 01:42:33.208
Was she just another photo?

949
01:42:34.833 --> 01:42:38.666
Just another picture of this fuckin' war
puzzle that you try to figure out?

950
01:42:41.874 --> 01:42:43.916
Was she just like me?

951
01:42:44.541 --> 01:42:45.999
Was she just like me?

952
01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:50.374
Was she just someone you could pick
up and throw away and forget about?

953
01:43:01.124 --> 01:43:03.583
How do you live with yourself?

954
01:43:21.374 --> 01:43:23.458
Andrew! Penny!

955
01:43:23.999 --> 01:43:25.541
Are you there?

956
01:43:27.999 --> 01:43:29.833
Will you just open the door?

957
01:43:33.749 --> 01:43:35.791
I just need somewhere to stay.

958
01:43:40.624 --> 01:43:42.624
Come on Penny, 
I know you're in there.

959
01:44:05.458 --> 01:44:07.916
You know Jonathan, all
that stuff in the papers,

960
01:44:08.124 --> 01:44:10.124
that's all just speculation.

961
01:44:10.624 --> 01:44:12.958
All right? It's rubbish.

962
01:44:13.083 --> 01:44:15.124
They have no proof.

963
01:44:20.833 --> 01:44:22.874
I'm still your uncle.

964
01:44:28.749 --> 01:44:30.458
No you're not.

965
01:44:30.583 --> 01:44:32.624
We both think you're fuckin' stupid.

966
01:44:32.749 --> 01:44:33.708
What did you say?

967
01:44:33.791 --> 01:44:34.749
Leave me alone!

968
01:44:34.874 --> 01:44:37.833
I hope they kill you.

969
01:44:37.958 --> 01:44:40.333
I hope they-

970
01:44:40.541 --> 01:44:42.833
It's okay!

971
01:44:47.916 --> 01:44:50.874
It's alright. I know you like her.

972
01:44:54.583 --> 01:44:56.916
Listen, you have to tell me
what you meant by "both of you".

973
01:44:57.916 --> 01:44:59.083
Look at me.

974
01:44:59.208 --> 01:45:01.791
What did you mean by
"both of us think you're stupid"?

975
01:45:01.874 --> 01:45:04.249
Tell me what you
meant by "both of us".

976
01:45:04.374 --> 01:45:07.291
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
I promise I won't hurt you.

977
01:45:12.583 --> 01:45:14.083
What is it, Jonathan?

978
01:45:15.208 --> 01:45:17.541
I was looking for my camera.

979
01:45:41.791 --> 01:45:44.583
I thought he was
hiding it to protect you.

980
01:45:49.583 --> 01:45:51.166
Where is he?

981
01:45:51.333 --> 01:45:53.916
In Christchurch till tomorrow.

982
01:46:05.999 --> 01:46:07.541
Paul!

983
01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:10.624
Paul, are you there?

984
01:46:14.624 --> 01:46:15.916
RIVER

985
01:46:28.749 --> 01:46:31.041
I just heard from the lawyer.

986
01:46:31.166 --> 01:46:32.999
What do you mean
you don't want to sell?

987
01:46:33.124 --> 01:46:35.207
You can't. I'm up to my eyeballs-

988
01:46:39.374 --> 01:46:40.707
What the hell did you do that for?

989
01:46:40.832 --> 01:46:41.749
Get up!

990
01:46:42.624 --> 01:46:44.457
Get up!

991
01:46:48.207 --> 01:46:51.457
What were you going to do? 
Plant it at my place like the atlas?

992
01:46:51.582 --> 01:46:53.541
This is really unnecessary

993
01:46:53.666 --> 01:46:55.541
Okay! Okay!

994
01:47:02.832 --> 01:47:05.624
There was a time I
wondered why you up and left.

995
01:47:06.666 --> 01:47:09.124
You knew what he
was up to, didn't you?

996
01:47:09.624 --> 01:47:11.499
At least look at me and tell me

997
01:47:11.582 --> 01:47:13.541
before you pull the trigger.

998
01:47:17.416 --> 01:47:19.416
You know the really sad part?

999
01:47:20.541 --> 01:47:23.249
I didn't even find out
until I read the will.

1000
01:47:23.416 --> 01:47:25.707
That's how far back I was.

1001
01:47:26.416 --> 01:47:28.374
But then how was I to know, Paul?

1002
01:47:28.499 --> 01:47:31.041
I was only a kid, a 15-year-old kid.

1003
01:47:32.207 --> 01:47:35.666
You killed me when you walked away and
left me with that evil piece of scum.

1004
01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:38.707
You think you even
get a second fuckin' chance?

1005
01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:40.582
You knew, you bastard!

1006
01:47:40.707 --> 01:47:44.166
And you had the gall to come back
here and bring that thing into our house.

1007
01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:46.332
My mother's house!

1008
01:47:46.666 --> 01:47:49.791
And god knows what you're doing with
her, but then like father like son.

1009
01:47:49.874 --> 01:47:52.374
Andrew, you don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

1010
01:48:02.666 --> 01:48:04.832
He was screwing that teenage whore of yours.

1011
01:48:04.916 --> 01:48:05.332
No!

1012
01:48:05.541 --> 01:48:06.374
He was. You knew it.

1013
01:48:06.457 --> 01:48:07.916
And you walked.

1014
01:48:07.999 --> 01:48:09.874
Andrew no! It's got nothing
to fuckin' do with you!

1015
01:48:10.082 --> 01:48:11.416
You saw it with your own eyes!

1016
01:48:11.707 --> 01:48:13.999
You knew and you walked
and you never looked back.

1017
01:48:14.082 --> 01:48:15.416
What did you do to her?

1018
01:48:15.499 --> 01:48:17.957
Our mother died the
moment that bastard was conceived.

1019
01:48:18.041 --> 01:48:19.666
Just tell me.

1020
01:48:22.999 --> 01:48:28.041
Wherefore come out from among
them, and be ye separate,

1021
01:48:28.124 --> 01:48:31.332
saith the Lord, and
touch not the unclean thing.

1022
01:48:43.374 --> 01:48:44.749
Tell me!

1023
01:48:44.957 --> 01:48:45.791
Go ahead and cry.

1024
01:48:46.082 --> 01:48:47.957
It's about time you cried for our mother.

1025
01:48:48.166 --> 01:48:49.624
I'll kill you. 
I fuckin' swear I'll kill you.

1026
01:48:52.999 --> 01:48:54.874
I told her everything.

1027
01:48:55.249 --> 01:48:56.707
Everything!

1028
01:48:57.457 --> 01:48:59.791
Someone had to set the record straight.

1029
01:49:01.124 --> 01:49:03.082
I had a right to that money, Paul.

1030
01:49:03.207 --> 01:49:06.124
That money was mine if
nothing else, at least that.

1031
01:49:09.957 --> 01:49:13.624
And I should give her a third
at 18 along with a nice little letter.

1032
01:49:14.457 --> 01:49:17.624
Rather convenient, eh? 
Nice and smooth.

1033
01:49:19.499 --> 01:49:21.416
She wanted proof.

1034
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:26.249
She asked to see the will.

1035
01:49:30.916 --> 01:49:32.457
Wait here.

1036
01:49:44.415 --> 01:49:46.374
Mom was there.

1037
01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.124
She...

1038
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:49.874
What?

1039
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:55.332
What?

1040
01:50:28.290 --> 01:50:29.832
What are you doing in here?

1041
01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:31.915
I was just looking.

1042
01:50:32.582 --> 01:50:34.415
Who are you

1043
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.582
He brought me here.

1044
01:50:41.374 --> 01:50:42.999
I know what you are.

1045
01:50:43.124 --> 01:50:45.665
You have no right
to be in my house.

1046
01:50:46.332 --> 01:50:50.374
I want you to stay away from
my family. Is that clear? Stay away.

1047
01:50:55.207 --> 01:50:57.540
So he told you about me.

1048
01:51:00.374 --> 01:51:02.249
Haven't you told her?

1049
01:51:04.957 --> 01:51:07.165
I told you to wait outside.

1050
01:51:09.665 --> 01:51:11.707
Is it true, Andrew?

1051
01:51:24.415 --> 01:51:26.082
You people.

1052
01:51:26.915 --> 01:51:28.790
Get out!

1053
01:51:40.082 --> 01:51:41.707
She smiled, Paul.

1054
01:51:43.374 --> 01:51:45.457
Simple misunderstanding.

1055
01:51:47.832 --> 01:51:49.874
What's done is done.

1056
01:52:02.999 --> 01:52:05.457
For what it's worth
mum wants it this way.

1057
01:54:02.873 --> 01:54:04.582
Uncle Paul?

1058
01:54:04.707 --> 01:54:06.415
Jonathan...

1059
01:54:06.665 --> 01:54:08.498
Can you come over?

1060
01:55:14.165 --> 01:55:15.957
I rang the police.

1061
01:55:16.582 --> 01:55:18.332
Am I in trouble?

1062
01:55:32.623 --> 01:55:34.207
No, you're not.

1063
01:55:38.873 --> 01:55:43.582
Mazzy Star "Into Dust"

1064
01:57:15.915 --> 01:57:17.498
Paul, wait!

1065
01:57:18.206 --> 01:57:20.040
Paul, wait!

1066
01:57:21.206 --> 01:57:23.040
Paul, come back home!

1067
01:57:24.748 --> 01:57:26.998
Paul, don't leave!

1068
01:57:30.665 --> 01:57:32.956
Paul!

1069
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:46.665
The people had no choice

1070
01:57:46.748 --> 01:57:49.498
but to trust that the horses
would lead them to their ocean.

1071
01:57:54.748 --> 01:57:56.540
Without reins or saddles

1072
01:57:56.665 --> 01:57:59.331
they rode the horses across the barren land.

1073
01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.540
But the ocean had disappeared for good.

1074
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:21.915
And the people, together
and alone had no choice

1075
01:58:22.165 --> 01:58:25.248
but to face each other in their loss.

1076
01:58:27.498 --> 01:58:30.373
They made a home for
themselves in a new environment.

1077
01:58:31.706 --> 01:58:34.165
Although one that had changed forever.

1078
01:58:36.998 --> 01:58:39.915
They learnt to live in the
space that the ocean had left.

1079
01:58:43.748 --> 01:58:46.123
One day the tide went away

1080
01:58:46.248 --> 01:58:48.998
Although it lingered in their dreams.

1081
01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.498
Celia!

1082
01:59:01.581 --> 01:59:03.998
Your e-mail said it was urgent.

1083
01:59:06.206 --> 01:59:07.790
Yeah,

1084
01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:10.415
I just wanted to see you.

1085
01:59:11.623 --> 01:59:13.665
I've just been reading your story.

1086
01:59:15.831 --> 01:59:18.290
So, you want to come in?
Have a cup of tea?

1087
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:23.915
I'll make you a macchito.

1088
01:59:28.581 --> 01:59:30.498
I wanted to give you this.

1089
01:59:32.706 --> 01:59:34.165
It's a bit out of date.

1090
01:59:34.290 --> 01:59:37.206
I don't think the world has
changed that much in 25 years.

1091
01:59:39.581 --> 01:59:41.873
Have a look inside.

1092
01:59:51.498 --> 01:59:52.415
What's this?

1093
01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:53.748
What do you think it is?

1094
01:59:56.665 --> 01:59:59.415
It's open. So you can
use it anytime you like.

1095
02:00:00.373 --> 02:00:02.748
You can leave after school's finished.

1096
02:00:08.706 --> 02:00:10.623
Hey, Celia, this is not some pathetic attempt

1097
02:00:10.748 --> 02:00:13.331
to make everything all right.

1098
02:00:15.831 --> 02:00:17.498
It's just-

1099
02:00:19.164 --> 02:00:21.414
the ticket is just a gift.

1100
02:00:25.289 --> 02:00:26.789
You knew about

1101
02:00:26.956 --> 02:00:29.331
mum and your father together.

1102
02:00:31.998 --> 02:00:34.164
But I didn't know about you.

1103
02:00:38.831 --> 02:00:40.498
Why didn't you just tell me?

1104
02:00:40.914 --> 02:00:41.956
I didn't know how.

1105
02:00:43.998 --> 02:00:45.748
I'm sorry.

1106
02:00:52.539 --> 02:00:53.956
Look...

1107
02:00:56.956 --> 02:00:58.748
in Spain,

1108
02:01:00.414 --> 02:01:03.123
there's a place called Andaluzia.

1109
02:01:04.873 --> 02:01:07.414
It's hot and it's white and dusty.

1110
02:01:08.456 --> 02:01:10.664
And you can see the ocean.

1111
02:01:13.039 --> 02:01:14.581
This is it.

1112
02:01:23.914 --> 02:01:25.039
I can drive you home.

1113
02:01:25.289 --> 02:01:26.789
It's Okay. I can walk.

1114
02:01:34.581 --> 02:01:36.039
Paul?

1115
02:01:38.706 --> 02:01:39.623
About the ticket.

1116
02:01:40.789 --> 02:01:41.706
Don't worry about it, of course.

1117
02:01:42.123 --> 02:01:43.123
Promise?

1118
02:01:43.164 --> 02:01:44.164
Yeah.

1119
02:01:44.289 --> 02:01:45.956
It's our secret.

1120
02:01:47.831 --> 02:01:50.206
Es nuestro secreto.

1121
02:01:51.956 --> 02:01:54.248
I thought you couldn't speak Spanish.

1122
02:02:04.831 --> 02:02:06.581
Adios, brother.

1123
02:02:18.373 --> 02:02:20.081
Bye, Celia.
