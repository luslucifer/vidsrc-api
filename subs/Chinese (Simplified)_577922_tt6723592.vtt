1
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.370
叫醒美国佬

2
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.910
嘿
Hey!


3
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.440
国家歌剧院

4
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.290
我们活在一个暮光世界
We live in a twilight world.


5
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.840
我们活在一个暮光世界
We live in a twilight world.


6
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.970
且黄昏时没有朋友
And there are no friends at dusk.


7
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.050
你的身分曝光 这场突袭是为了消灭你
You've been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you.


8
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.100
但我建立了联系
But I established contact.


9
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.730
带你走或杀了你 我只有两分钟 快做决定
Bring you in or kill you. I have two minutes. Make up your mind.


10
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.110
东西在哪里 
Where's the package?


11
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.280
衣帽间
Coat check.


12
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.850
待在这里
Stay.


13
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.930
拿他的

14
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.300
你在干嘛

15
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.040
你在干嘛

16
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.570
你是谁

17
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.830
黄昏时没有朋友 
No friends at dusk, huh?


18
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.340
有你就行 带他到集合点
You'll do. Get him to the rally point.


19
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.200
换衣服 乌克兰人等的是一名乘客
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians are expecting a passenger.


20
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.250
我从没看过这种容器
I've never seen encapsulation like this.


21
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.420
不知道有多古老 但是货真价实
We don't know how old it is, but it's the real deal.


22
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.460
有逃脱备案吗 
Did you have an out?


23
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.340
通往下水道的施工隧道
Service tunnel to the sewer.


24
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.670
拿去 带他走他的出口 我不信任我们的人
Take this. Take him. Take his exit. I don't trust ours anymore.


25
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.710
能拆除炸弹吗 
Can you defuse that?


26
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.630
那会同步引爆 还有更多吗 
They're centrally synchronized. Are there more?


27
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.430
这可以掩盖他们的踪迹
Covering their tracks.


28
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.720
-连观众都炸  -它们只是廉价的位子
- Taking out the audience? - They're just the cheap seats.


29
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.330
快走吧
Walk away.


30
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.300
你不必杀死这些人
You don't have to kill these people.


31
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.730
-他不是我们的人 -我需要帮手
That wasn't one of us. I'll take the help.


32
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.690
快走 快走
Go, go, go.


33
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.050
不是那家伙

34
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.890
人在受训后 撑得住18小时刑求
A man can be trained to hold out for about 18 hours,


35
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.020
所以你的同僚7点后就安全了
so your colleagues will be clear by 7:00.


36
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.070
他连18分钟都撑不住
He didn't last 18 minutes.


37
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.990
他没什么好隐瞒了
He didn't have anything to hide.


38
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.450
你救出个无名小卒
You were smuggling a nobody.


39
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.120
风险很大
It's risky.


40
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.710
还是你指望这玩意 
Or were you counting on this?


41
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.170
自杀药丸 中情局标配
Death. CIA issue.


42
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.600
他们一旦安全就让自己活命
Spare yourself, once they clear.


43
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.110
就快7点了 糟糕
Almost 7:00. Uh-oh.


44
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.120
时钟跑太快
It's running fast.


45
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.380
我得拨慢一小时
We have to put it back one hour.


46
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.610
吐出来
Get it out!


47
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.470
欢迎来到来世
Welcome to the afterlife.


48
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.720
你陷入人工昏迷期间
You've been in a medically-induced coma


49
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.140
我们把你救出来 重建你的口腔
while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.


50
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.350
自杀药丸是假的
The suicide pills are fake.


51
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.520
为什么 
Why?


52
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.940
这是个考验
A test.


53
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.480
考验 
A test?


54
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.650
他们拔光我的牙齿
They pulled my teeth out.


55
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.410
小队安全逃走了吗 
Did my team get clear?


56
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.750
没有 可能是俄罗斯佣兵干的
No. Private Russians, we think.


57
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.670
有人招供
Somebody talked.


58
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.830
你没有
Not you.


59
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.380
你宁死也不愿放弃同僚
You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues.


60
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.310
我们都相信自己会冲进火场
We all believe we'd run into the burning building.


61
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.850
直到感受到热浪
But until we feel that heat,


62
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.720
谁也不能确定 但你能
we can never know.You do.


63
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.200
我辞职
I resign.


64
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.240
你不替我们做事 你已经死了
You don't work for us. You're dead.


65
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.290
你的职责超越国家利益
Your duty transcends national interests.


66
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.210
这是为了人类存亡
This is about survival.


67
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.710
谁的 
Whose?


68
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.630
所有人
Everyone's.


69
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.760
这是一场冷酷无情的冷战
There's a cold war, cold as ice.


70
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.140
只要知道它的本质就会输
To even know its true nature is to lose.


71
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.140
天机不可泄漏
This is knowledge divided.


72
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.900
我只能给你一个手势 加上一个字
All I have for you is a gesture in combination with a word.


73
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.190
天能
"Tenet."


74
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.320
小心运用
Use it carefully.


75
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.160
它能开启正确的门 也会打开错误的门
It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones, too.


76
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.160
他们只告诉你这些 
That's all they've told you?


77
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.080
你通过的考验
That test you passed?


78
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.540
不是每个人都能通过
Not everybody does.


79
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.810
爱西尼号

80
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.450
启动

81
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.800
B-2室

82
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.380
穿上反光背心 拿着笔记板 几乎就能闯入任何地方
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard, you can get almost anywhere.


83
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.180
几乎啦
Almost.


84
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.810
谜一般的天能
An obscure tenet.


85
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.480
别闲聊 别曝露我们的身分和目的
No small talk. Nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do.


86
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.240
我以为我是来找出任务目的
I thought I was here to find out what we do.


87
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.160
你不必知道 只要学会
You're not here for "what," you're here for "how."


88
00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.580
那是你的任务 与我无关
"What" is your department and not my business.


89
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.370
为了执行任务
Well, to do what I do...


90
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.580
我需要知道面对什么威胁
I need some idea of the threat we face.


91
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.920
以我的了解 我们试图阻止第三次世界大战
As I understand it, we're trying to prevent World War III.


92
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.550
核战 
Nuclear holocaust?


93
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.130
不
No.


94
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.260
更糟的事
Something worse.


95
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.860
瞄准后开枪
Aim it and pull the trigger.


96
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.190
弹匣是空的
It's empty.


97
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.230
瞄准
Aim it.


98
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.070
检查弹匣
Check the magazine.


99
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.710
怎么会 
How?


100
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.470
其中一颗子弹和我们一样 顺着时间向前进
One of these bullets is like us, traveling forwards through time.


101
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.970
另一颗则是向后退
The other one's going backwards.


102
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.640
分得出来吗 
Can you tell which is which?


103
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.810
现在呢 完全逆转
How about now?


104
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.400
熵造成反向运作 让动作看起来全都倒转
It's inverted. Its entropy runs backwards. So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed.


105
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.860
可能是核分裂引发的反向辐射
We think it's a type of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission.


106
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.320
-不是你制造的  -我们还不知道怎么做
You didn't make it?


107
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.030
有人在未来制造 然后逆转时间传送给我们
Someone's manufacturing them in the future. They're streaming back at us.


108
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.370
试试看
Try it.


109
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.250
你要想着放下子弹
You have to have dropped it.


110
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.100
我还没碰 它怎么会动 
How can it move before I touch it?


111
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.020
从你的角度是你抓住子弹
From your point of view, you caught it.


112
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.520
从子弹的角度是你放下它
But from the bullet's point of view, you dropped it.


113
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.520
但原因应该先于结果
But cause comes before effect.


114
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.320
不 那是我们看待时间的方法
No, that's just the way we see time.


115
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.070
自由意志呢 
Well, what about free will?


116
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.740
你不出手 那颗子弹就不会动
That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn't put your hand there.


117
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.780
不管怎么看 都是你造成的
Either way we run the tape, you made it happen.


118
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.790
别试着理解它
Don't try to understand it.


119
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.250
感受它
Feel it.


120
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.970
直觉
Instinct.


121
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.850
我懂了
Got it.


122
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.690
为何感觉这么奇怪 
Why does it feel so strange?


123
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.570
你不是射出子弹 而是接住它
You're not shooting the bullet, you're catching it.


124
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.780
哇塞
Whoa.


125
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.450
我看过这种子弹
I've seen this type of ammunition before.


126
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.490
出任务时
In the field?


127
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.780
我差点被打中
I was almost hit.


128
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.540
那你很幸运
Then you were exceedingly lucky.


129
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.500
被逆转的子弹打中会受重伤 下场很惨
An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. Not pretty.


130
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.500
这些像是现代的子弹
These look like today's.


131
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.090
可能是现在制造 却在多年后被逆转
They may have been made today and inverted years from now.


132
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.170
从哪弄来的 
Where did you get them?


133
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.420
墙上挖出来的 我奉命研究这里所有的物质
Came with the wall. I was assigned it, like all the material I'm studying here.


134
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.680
分析过金属成分吗 
Do you have an analysis on the metals?


135
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.600
当然了 怎么了 
Sure. Why?


136
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.520
混合哪些合金我也许能辨识 是在哪里制造 听好
The mixture of alloys can tell me where they might have been made. Look...


137
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.640
这不是世界末日
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.


138
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.900
子弹看似普通 但却是一台简单机器
The bullet may not seem like much, but it's a simple machine.


139
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.740
铅弹头 铜弹壳 火药
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.


140
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.070
他们能逆转子弹就能逆转任何东西
If they can invert that, I see no reason they couldn't invert pretty much anything.


141
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.200
一枚核弹只能危害人类未来
Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future.


142
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.910
但逆转时间的武器却能毁灭这世界
An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.


143
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.710
既然已经知道这种科技 就能找到更多逆转的物质
Now that we know what to look for, we're finding more and more inverted material.


144
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.970
更复杂的残余物
Remnants of complex objects.


145
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.930
你觉得这些是什么 
What do you think we're seeing?


146
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.270
即将来临的战争废墟
The detritus of a coming war.


147
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.330
-喂  -我们活在一个暮光世界
- Yep? - We live in a twilight world.


148
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.670
黄昏时没有朋友 我听说你死了
No friends at dusk. I was told you left the building.


149
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.290
就连死人也需要盟友
Even the dead need allies.


150
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.540
什么盟友 
Specifically?


151
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.130
我在孟买需要帮手找到桑杰辛格
I need an assist in Mumbai. I need to get to Sanjay Singh.


152
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.180
辛格 他足不出户 他家
Singh? He never leaves his house. And his house is...


153
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.260
-很高 -没错 我看到了
- his house. - Yes, it is.


154
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.350
两小时后孟买游艇俱乐部见
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.


155
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.160
看来你临时需要人介绍 一位有威望的孟买当地人士
It seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice.


156
00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.580
-我是尼尔 -我想见桑杰辛格
I'm Neil. I need an audience with Sanjay Singh.


157
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.080
不可能
That's not possible.


158
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.540
最多10分钟
Ten minutes tops.


159
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.840
问题不是时间
Time isn't the problem.


160
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.090
而是能不能活着出来
It's getting out alive that's the problem.


161
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.310
你会胁持小孩或女人当人质吗 
Would you take a child hostage? A woman?


162
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.220
有必要的话 我不想要惹麻烦
If I had to. I'm not looking to make much noise here.


163
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:33.770
点什么 
Yes?


164
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.730
伏特加通宁和健怡可乐
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.


165
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.190
怎么了 
What?


166
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.990
-你出任务时不喝酒 -知道就好
You never drink on the job. You're well-informed.


167
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.660
这是干我们这一行的好处
Well, pays to be in our profession.


168
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.740
我宁愿喝苏打水
Well, I prefer soda water.


169
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.580
才怪
No, you don't.


170
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.580
你的跳伞技术怎样 
How's your parachuting?


171
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.580
受训时摔断过脚踝
I broke an ankle during basic training.


172
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.550
辛格的房子不够高 不能跳伞
Singh's house isn't tall enough to parachute off of.


173
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.720
-但具有高空弹跳性 -高空弹跳性不算个词
It's bungee-jumpable. I don't think "bungee-jumpable" is a word.


174
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.760
也许不是 但那是唯一逃脱的方法
It may not be a word, but it may be our only way out of that place.


175
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.970
或是闯进去的方法
Or into it, for that matter.


176
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.310
我知道你累了 我也很累
I know you're tired. I'm also very tired.


177
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.160
退后
Stay back.


178
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:02.290
我在乌克兰差点被一种 非比寻常的子弹射死
I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.


179
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.710
我想知道是谁给的
I want to know who supplied it.


180
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.800
我是桑杰 你是 
My name is Sanjay. And you are?


181
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.050
不想闲聊 
No chitchat?


182
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.260
不会有人回应 也没人会来救你
There's no one at the other end. No one who's gonna help you, anyway.


183
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.560
别让食物凉掉
Don't let it get cold.


184
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.560
我怎么知道是谁给的 
Why should I know who supplied it?


185
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.310
金属成分只有印度才有
The combination of metals is unique to India.


186
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.940
如果来自印度  那就是你给的
If it's from India, it's from you.


187
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.900
那么  扣钱吧
Deduction, then.


188
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.870
我不是被派来谈判的
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.


189
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.120
也不是来跟你交易
Or the man they send to make deals.


190
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.000
但有事大家都来找我
But I am the man people talk to.


191
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.420
不行 我不能告诉你
I can't.


192
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.890
泄漏客户的机密
This may be the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull.


193
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.180
会违反他奉为准则的教条
To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by.


194
00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.890
如果你这么重视教条
If tenets are important to you,


195
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.930
那就告诉我一切
then you can tell me, everything.


196
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.360
桑杰 请替客人倒杯酒
Sanjay, make a drink for our guest, please.


197
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.570
干杯 我是普莉亚
Cheers. - Priya. - Hmm.


198
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.610
你才是幕后老大 
This is your operation?


199
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.030
拿男人当傀儡在男人世界很有用
A masculine front in a man's world has its uses.


200
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.410
你找的军火商是安德烈萨托
The dealer you're looking for is Andrei Sator.


201
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.660
俄国的大财阀
The Russian oligarch.


202
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.460
-你认识他  -没有私交
- You know him? - Not personally.


203
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.960
靠天然气成为亿万富豪
Made his billions in gas.


204
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.420
听说在莫斯科失宠后搬到伦敦
Moved to London. Said to be on the outs with Moscow.


205
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.260
很好
Very good.


206
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.430
但他不是靠天然气致富 而是靠钚元素
Except the gas he made his billions from was actually plutonium.


207
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:38.350
这不能解释你为何或如何 把逆转子弹卖给他
None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions.


208
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.930
我卖子弹给他的时候 它们都很普通
When I sold him the rounds, they were perfectly ordinary.


209
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.680
他是怎么逆转子弹 
So how did he get them inverted?


210
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.350
我们认为他只是个掮客
We believe he's functioning as some sort of a broker.


211
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.560
现在和未来的中间人
Between our time and the future.


212
00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.570
他能和未来的人沟通 
He can communicate with the future?


213
00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.320
我们都行啊 电邮 信用卡 简讯
We all do, don't we? E-mails, credit cards, texts.


214
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.490
任何纪录都能直接和未来的人沟通
Anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future.


215
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.450
问题是 未来的人能回应吗 
The question is, can the future speak back?


216
00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.040
我要负责查出来 
And I'm supposed to find out?


217
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.170
想靠近萨托就需要全新的主人翁
To get anywhere near Sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist.


218
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.340
你就是最好的人选
And you are fresh as a daisy.


219
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.090
接近他 查出他用什么方法收到什么
Get close. Find out what he's receiving and how.


220
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.430
让英国情报局介入安全吗 
Is it safe to involve British Intelligence?


221
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.100
我有个萨托动不了的联络人
I have a contact who's out of Sator's reach.


222
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.360
你一定有逃走的计划
You must've had a plan for getting out.


223
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.690
我并不喜欢
Not one I love.


224
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.590
我能效劳吗 
May I help you, sir?


225
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.050
我是寇斯比先生的午餐
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.


226
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.140
我假设你和麦可寇斯比爵士约吃午餐
I presume you mean Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.


227
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.300
尽管假设吧
Presume away.


228
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.850
请跟我来
If you'll follow me.


229
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.150
我先吃了 别介意
Started without you. Hope you don't mind.


230
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.770
我会跟上的
I'll catch up.


231
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.030
我要一样的
Same for me, please.


232
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.150
我叫服务生来
I'll send the waiter.


233
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.860
交代一声就行了
No, just pass on the order.


234
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.870
我猜你对某个俄国人士有兴趣
I gather you have an interest in a certain Russian national.


235
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.580
英俄人士 我得格外小心
Anglo-Russian. So I have to watch my step.


236
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.370
没错 他是英国情报局的线人
Indeed. He's tapped into the intelligence services.


237
00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.250
我警告过他们 他都乱给情报
I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish...


238
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.040
但他们似乎不在乎
but they don't seem to care.


239
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.210
跟我说说他
Tell me about him.


240
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.850
你应该对 苏联时期的秘密城市很熟悉
I assume you're familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities.


241
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.430
地图上找不到的封闭城市 建立在敏感企业周围
Closed cities, not shown on maps. Built around sensitive industries.


242
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.680
多数都已开放 也重新命名为一般城镇
Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns.


243
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.100
但萨托成长的城市并不是 史托斯克12市
Not the one Sator grew up in.


244
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.400
出了意外 后来就用来做地下核试验
Some kind of accident. After which it was used for underground tests.


245
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.860
两星期前 发生基辅歌剧院突袭的同一天
Two weeks ago, same day as the Kiev opera siege,


246
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.990
我们发现北西伯利亚发生核爆
we spotted a detonation in northern Siberia,


247
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.410
就在史托斯克12市的旧址
just where Stalsk-12 was.


248
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.750
萨托从地图上的空白中崛起
Sator emerged from this blank spot on the map


249
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.960
野心勃勃 砸下大钱进入英国体制
with ambition... and enough money to buy his way into the British establishment.


250
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.050
透过他妻子 
Through his wife?


251
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.790
凯萨琳巴顿 佛德瑞克巴顿爵士的大侄女
Katherine Barton. Oldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.


252
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.720
她在薛普利拍卖行工作 拍卖会上认识了萨托
She works at Shipley's. Met Sator at an auction.


253
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.680
婚姻幸福 
A happy marriage?


254
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.220
早已形同陌路
Practically estranged.


255
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.430
-我要怎么接近萨托  -当然是透过她
Well, how do I get to Sator?


256
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.770
非也
Hardly.


257
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.860
我们有一张王牌
We have an ace in the hole.


258
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.150
你用购物袋装哥雅名画
You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag.


259
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.950
这是西班牙人阿雷波画的假画
It's a fake by a Spaniard named Arepo.


260
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.200
从瑞士伯恩没收来的其中一幅
One of two we've confiscated from an embezzler in Bern.


261
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:47.620
另一幅怎么了 
What happened to the other one?


262
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.910
经过凯萨琳监定后 出现在薛普利拍卖行
It turned up at Shipley's. Authenticated by Katherine Barton.


263
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.870
然后拿去拍卖 你猜被谁买走 
Put on auction. And who do you think bought it?


264
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.080
她丈夫 
Her husband?


265
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:56.930
Mmm-hmm.

266
00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.380
她知道是假画吗 
Does she know it's a forgery?


267
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.760
很难说
Oh, it's hard to say.


268
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.890
谣传她和阿雷波关系亲密
Rumor has it that she and Arepo were close.


269
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.100
嗯
Uh-huh.


270
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.310
别介意喔
Look, no offense,


271
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.890
但你若想假冒一个亿万富豪
but in this world, when someone is claiming to be a billionaire...


272
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.690
穿平价西装可骗不了人
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.


273
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.320
我的预算有限
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.


274
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.070
先拯救世界再核销开支
Save the world, then we'll balance the books.


275
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.320
让我推荐一位裁缝师
Can I recommend a tailor?


276
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.610
不用劳您大驾
I'll manage.


277
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.120
不是你们英国人才会狗眼看人低
You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery, you know.


278
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.160
你误会了 我们只想插一脚
Well, not a monopoly. More of a controlling interest.


279
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.660
麻烦帮我打包
Could you box that up for me?


280
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.920
想都别想
Certainly not.


281
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.960
再见 麦可爵士
Goodbye, Sir Michael.


282
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:52.060
坎农街3号

283
00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.490
薛普利拍卖行

284
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.330
我能效劳吗 
How can I help, sir?


285
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.460
抱歉 您没预约 这位先生
Sorry, I wasn't notified of any appointments, Mr...


286
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.540
哥雅
Goya.


287
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.710
哥雅先生 
Mr. Goya.


288
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.220
不是 我听说你能监定哥雅名画
No. I'm told you're the person to see about Goya.


289
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.590
太了不起了
That's extraordinary.


290
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.060
值多少钱 
What's it worth?


291
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.980
先别急
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.


292
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.230
估价前要做很多监定
Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation.


293
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.490
收藏历史 显微镜和X光检验
Provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays.


294
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.820
你的直觉是什么 
But what does your heart tell you?


295
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.160
你说是向谁买下这幅画 
Sir, where did you say you acquired this drawing?


296
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.040
汤玛士阿雷波
Tomas Arepo.


297
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.920
我用几分美金 向愤怒的瑞士银行家买下这幅画
I bought my Goya for cents on a dollar from an irate Swiss banker.


298
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.930
追溯到阿雷波 才发现我挖到宝
Traced it back to Arepo, then realized I scored a bargain


299
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.800
因为他告诉我 谁用高价买下他另一幅假画
when he told me who paid top dollar for another one of his pictures.


300
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.850
-你先生 -你挖到什么宝 
- Your husband. - Where's your bargain?


301
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.470
这画显然是假的
Your drawing's an obvious fake.


302
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.730
我的画是幅逼真的假画 你比谁都清楚
My drawing's a very good fake.


303
00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.360
我帮忙诈骗自己老公这件事 
The information that I helped defraud my own husband?


304
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.440
他和我算是同行 但想见到他真的很难
He and I are in related businesses, but he's a very hard man to meet.


305
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.360
-假如我们谈笔交易 -交易 
If you and I were to make an arrangement...


306
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.540
别这么怕这字眼 我先生并不怕
Don't be afraid of the word. My husband isn't.


307
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.450
很遗憾 他抢先你一步
I'm sorry to tell you he got there first.


308
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.660
他早就知道却没有采取行动 
He knows? And he's never done anything about it?


309
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.290
-何必呢  -他被骗了9百万美元啊
Why would he? He paid $9 million for it.


310
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.880
不过就是他逼我们度假的花费
Barely cover the cost of the holiday he just forced us on.


311
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.420
去火星度假吗 
Where'd you go, Mars?


312
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.550
越南 坐我们的游艇 他的游艇
Vietnam, on our yacht. His yacht.


313
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.140
你一身高级西装 名鞋 名表
You've got the suit. The shoes, the watch.


314
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.510
却有点自不量力
Think you're a little out of your depth.


315
00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.850
像你先生这种财富庞大的有钱人
People who've amassed fortunes, like your husband's,


316
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.610
通常不会容忍自己被诈骗
generally aren't okay with being cheated out of any of it.


317
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.990
那幅画是用来控制我的把柄
The drawing is his hold over me.


318
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.620
他威胁要报警 让我坐牢
He threatened me with police. Prison. The works.


319
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.710
他控制我
He controls me.


320
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.630
我和儿子的相处 所有的一切
My contact with my son. Everything.


321
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.010
离开他本就很难 现在更不可能了
Leaving would never have been easy but now it's impossible.


322
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.300
我反抗不了他
You can't fight.


323
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.930
只能哀求他
Just beg.


324
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.350
我在越南试过再去爱他
In Vietnam, I tried to love him again.


325
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.610
以为如果有爱 他就会把儿子还给我
Thought if there was love there, he might give me my son back.


326
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.860
我们坐在天杀的游艇上看夕阳
We sat on that bloody boat watching the sunsets,


327
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.280
重温昔日幸福时光
imitating some earlier time in our lives.


328
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.610
他似乎很快乐 于是我问他
He seemed happy, so I asked him.


329
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.990
他提出条件
And he made me an offer.


330
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.700
我不再见儿子他就放我走
He'd let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.


331
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.250
我表达了意见 把麦斯带上岸
I expressed myself. I took Max ashore.


332
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.170
他带着悔意打给我 当我们回到游艇
He called us, contrite.


333
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.590
我却看到一个女人跳下海 然后他就消失不见
And when we got back, I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat, and he'd vanished.


334
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.560
我从来没这么嫉妒过
I never felt such envy.


335
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.020
你不像是会嫉妒的人
You don't seem the jealous type.


336
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.850
我嫉妒她的自由
Of her freedom.


337
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.070
你知道我有多想跳下海吗 
You know how I dream of just diving off that boat?


338
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.860
但你们有个儿子
But you share a son.


339
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.190
那就是我现在的生活
That's my life now.


340
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.820
你当时知道那是幅假画吗 
Did you know the drawing was a fake?


341
00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:38.370
不知道 我和汤玛士变得很亲密 也许太亲密了
No. Tomas and I became close, maybe too close.


342
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:39.620
我让他失望了
I failed.


343
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.330
安德烈不懂失望的感觉 只觉得遭到背叛
Andrei can't conceive of failure, only betrayal.


344
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.330
但我没有背叛我丈夫
But I didn't betray my husband.


345
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.830
回头看 或许我错失机会
Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance.


346
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.590
而他则放阿雷波走
And he let Arepo walk free.


347
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.800
如果你真的见过阿雷波
If you'd actually met Arepo as you claimed,


348
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.470
就会知道他早已不能走路
you'd understand he no longer walks anywhere.


349
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.510
-我们只讲过电话 -他也不能讲电话
We spoke on the phone. He can't do that either.


350
00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.760
-那幅画呢  -要干嘛 
- Where's the drawing? - Why?


351
00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.390
把我介绍给他 我就把画偷走
Get me an introduction. I'll take the drawing out of the equation.


352
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.060
没有画就不能告你 也不能威胁你
No picture, no prosecution, no more hold over you.


353
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.860
我是你的第二次机会
I might just be your second chance.


354
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.860
不 我不需要救赎
No, I don't need redemption.


355
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.480
你要背叛他
At betrayal.


356
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.740
你先生的朋友 
Friends of your husband's?


357
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.160
你早就知道了 
You knew this was going to happen?


358
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.450
放心 他们不会杀你
Don't worry, they won't kill you.


359
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.620
安德烈不喜欢和当地警察打交道
Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level.


360
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.920
你一定很不喜欢我的长相
You must've really not liked the look of me.


361
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.130
你的长相没问题
The look of you's fine.


362
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.970
最好先来狠的 免得我三心两意
It's best to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other.


363
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.470
你左边口袋有个号码 别从家里打来
There's a number in your left coat pocket. Don't call from home.


364
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.850
你不会接到我的电话
You won't be taking my call.


365
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.390
别小看我
I might surprise you.


366
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.550
我一小时前就点了辣椒酱
I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago.


367
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.800
能不能快点走 
Can we get going?


368
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.570
拜托
Please?


369
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.650
他要你亲眼看见
He wants you to see.


370
00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.520
然后再得到他要的
And he gets what he wants.


371
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.440
他也有吃鳖的一天
Not always, apparently.


372
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.240
安娜说我们要去庞贝看火山熔岩
Anna says we're going to Pompeii


373
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.310
我也会去 
I'll be there, too!


374
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.180
我就说别小看我
Told you I'd surprise you.


375
00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.900
-他很可爱 -他是我的一切
He's a cute kid. He's everything.


376
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.820
那幅画在哪 
Where's the drawing?


377
00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.820
奥斯陆的机场
Oslo. At the airport.


378
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.900
机场 
The airport?


379
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.160
知道自由港是什么吗 
Do you know what a Freeport is?


380
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.950
-专门储放艺术品的港口仓库 -尚未课税的艺术品
A storage facility for art that was acquired... But not yet taxed.


381
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.750
我们建立了一个网络
We started a network.


382
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.420
路特速营造公司负责盖仓库 我负责引进客户
Rotas, this construction company, built them. I brought in the clients.


383
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.580
这些仓库是避税天堂
The facilities are tax havens.


384
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.670
自由港

385
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.420
客户可以看到他们的投资 却不必进口到国内
The clients can view their investments without importing them,


386
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.300
这样就不必缴税
so they avoid paying tax.


387
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.090
就像是艺术品的转机贵宾室 
It's sorta like a transit lounge for art?


388
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.300
艺术品 古董
Art, antiquities.


389
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.510
-任何贵重物品 -任何东西 
- Anything of value, really. - Anything?


390
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.220
任何合法的东西
Anything legal.


391
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.690
就像是瑞士银行系统 完全隐密
But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system. Opaque.


392
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.980
你应该知道自由港多半只有仓库
As I'm sure you are aware, most Freeports are just warehouses.


393
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.730
但我们能确保你能享受
But here we ensure that you can actually enjoy...


394
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.200
路特速在奥斯陆自由港有仓库 我猜画在那里
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport. I'm guessing it's there.


395
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.320
保险库在这里
And this way to the vaults!


396
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.280
-你猜  -她猜的 
- Guessing? - Guessing?


397
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:49.620
我们每年去那里四五次
We make trips there four, five times a year.


398
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.540
-去看艺术品  -还有去干他的勾当
- To view art? - And whatever it is he does.


399
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.620
但艺术品对安德烈来说并不重要
Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei.


400
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.380
自由港才重要
But the Freeports are.


401
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.340
保险库是根据五角大厦结构建造
The structure of the vaults is based on the Pentagon.


402
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.130
每个保险库都有独立的结构体
Each vault a separate structure within the others.


403
00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.890
破坏一个结构体不会影响其它的
Damage to one structure won't compromise the others.


404
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:10.560
火警

405
00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:21.530
设有生物识别器 直接从
Some of our clients opt for biometric access, straight in...


406
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.570
机场跑道进出
off the tarmac.


407
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.910
从机场航厦 
From the terminal?


408
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.740
从他们的私人飞机
From their private planes.


409
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:29.870
当然了
Of course.


410
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:35.000
我们的后勤部门 从世界其它自由港运送货物
Our logistics department ships to and from


411
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.830
你想在那里找到什么 
What are you hoping to find in there?


412
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.210
你真想知道 
You really wanna know?


413
00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.960
我不确定
I'm not sure.


414
00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.050
带一些防辐射手套
Bring some lead-lined gloves.


415
00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.180
天啊 是核武
Jesus.


416
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.460
注意防火措施
pay attention to the fire precautions.


417
00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.730
-文件特别怕 -火灾 当然了
Documents are vulnerable to...


418
00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.230
我们不用洒水系统
We don't use sprinklers.


419
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.070
仓库会灌满卤烷
The facility is flooded with halide gas,


420
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.320
几秒内就能排除空气
displacing all the air within seconds.


421
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.490
你能示范吗 
Can you show me?


422
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.660
我们会窒息而死
If I did, we'd suffocate.


423
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.160
员工呢 
What about the staff?


424
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.660
卤烷只会灌满保险库 他们得逃进两边的走廊
Halide only fills the vaults, they just have to get into either corridor,


425
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.750
而且会有10秒的警告
and there is a 10-second warning.


426
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.920
至少你给他们10秒逃命
At least you give them 10 seconds.


427
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.970
客户会用我们就是因为 他们的货比我们的命更值钱
Well, sir, our clients use us because we have no priorities above their property.


428
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.430
真要命
Blimey.


429
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.760
全都是防火门
All doors are fireproof.


430
00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.680
液压开关 简单的钥匙和电子触发器
Hydraulic closers, simple key and electronic triggers.


431
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.640
全面封锁后要开启其实很容易
Surprisingly easy once there's a lockdown.


432
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.100
为何会全面封锁 
Why a lockdown?


433
00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.940
电源安全开关会导致外门密封
Power switches to fail-safes, sealing the outer doors,


434
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.690
但内门就回到原厂设定
but inner doors revert to factory settings.


435
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.280
锁头很容易撬开 简直就是小儿科
And pickable locks.


436
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:54.740
该怎么挟带重装武器 而不会触发封锁程序 
So, how do we get enough firepower through the perimeter to trigger the lockdown procedure?


437
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.960
自由港的后墙
Back wall of the Freeport.


438
00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.330
你有点子 
You've got something?


439
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.580
你不会喜欢
Not gonna like it.


440
00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.210
你想撞毁一架飞机 
You wanna crash a plane?


441
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.630
又不是让它坠毁 没那么夸张
Well, not from the air. Don't be so dramatic.


442
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.800
我要让一架喷射客机偏离跑道 撞上后墙引发一场大火
I want to run a jet off the taxiway and breach the rear wall and start a fire.


443
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.310
多大的飞机 
Well, how big a plane?


444
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.850
那部分就有点夸张了
Well, that part is a little dramatic.


445
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.980
这是米耶 他的小组会搞定飞机
This is Mahir.


446
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.980
挪威货运航空公司
Norsk Freight.


447
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.400
他们使用自由港西侧的机库
They use the hangar on the west side of the Freeport.


448
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.660
你要撞毁货机 机组员怎么办 
You want to crash a transport plane? What about the crew?


449
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.570
解开逃生滑梯 让他们逃命
We pop the slides, chuck 'em off.


450
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.870
在飞机滑行中 
On the move?


451
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.830
有什么问题 他们不会有事
What's the problem? They'll be fine.


452
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.290
这太胆大妄为了
Well, it seems bold.


453
00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.210
胆大妄为不错啊 我以为你会说疯狂
Bold I'm fine with. I thought you were gonna say nuts.


454
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:43.380
被抓了怎么办 
And if you get caught?


455
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.420
不会啦
We won't.


456
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.800
万一呢 
And if you do?


457
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.470
大家会以为是恐攻 但没人死亡
Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one's died,


458
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:53.640
快速引渡后逃过牢狱之灾 根本就不会上新闻
so swift extradition then lost in the system. It'll barely make the news.


459
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.930
这要看爆炸有多大
Oh, depends on the size of your explosion.


460
00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.520
其实金条一定会引起大骚动
Well, actually, the gold bars might get some play.


461
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.730
金条 
Gold bars?


462
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.060
挪威货运每月运送金条到国库
Norsk Freight ships Treasury gold once a month.


463
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.520
炸掉后货舱 金条散落在跑道
Blow the back. Drop it out on the runway.


464
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.070
我保证没人会注意仓库
No one will be looking at the building. I guarantee you.


465
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.200
五角仓库的中央空间太大了
The space in the center of the pentagon is too big.


466
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:15.620
那里有什么东西
There's something there.


467
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.740
但查不出来 平面图上没记号
Can't figure it out, it's just not marked.


468
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.830
45秒
That's 45 seconds.


469
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.960
绰绰有余
Ample.


470
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:24.500
你不是还得狂奔吗 
Won't you be running?


471
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.920
好吧 换你了 开始打包
All right, it's your turn. Start packing.


472
00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.570
各位 请通过安检门
Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector, please.


473
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.030
先生
Sir?


474
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.960
请问要喝咖啡或水 
I can offer you, perhaps, a coffee, water?


475
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.540
给我杯浓缩咖啡
No, I'll take an espresso.


476
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.380
-您呢  -不用 谢谢
- Sir? - No, thank you.


477
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.090
太好了
Excellent.


478
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.020
大家都吃素吗 我只有素食餐
Is everybody on this plane vegetarian? Because all I got here is vegetarian.


479
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.440
那看起来像是肉
So that looks like meat,


480
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.110
不过应该是素的 看起来都是素的
but I think that looks vegetarian. I think they both look vegetarian.


481
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.360
我也不知道 我被搞混了
I don't really know. It's confusing, ya know?


482
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.030
好吧
Okay.


483
00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.710
这里请 两位
This way, gentlemen.


484
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.140
两位 你们的储藏室
Gentlemen, your assigned compartment.


485
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.780
继续开 别用无线电
Carry on. Not the radio.


486
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.580
挪威货运

487
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.230
瑜珈
Yoga.


488
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.240
快走 快啊
Let's go! Now!


489
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:33.770
快点 快点
Go, go, go!


490
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.520
好吧
Right. Um...


491
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.410
你说10秒 对吧 
You said 10 seconds, right?


492
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.160
这里有别人
There's someone in here with us.


493
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:59.630
路特速

494
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.340
-要帮忙吗  -好啊
- Need a hand? - Actually, yes.


495
00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.410
别碰
Don't touch them!


496
00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:38.790
到底发生什么事 
The hell happened here?


497
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.130
事情还没发生
It hasn't happened yet.


498
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.480
别杀他
Don't kill him!


499
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.650
我们得知道身分是否曝光
We need to know if we've been compromised.


500
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.660
你为何在这里 你是谁 
Why are you here? Who are you?


501
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.200
你怎么知道我们在这 
How'd you know we'd be here?


502
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.180
我们得走了
We need to go.


503
00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:42.350
另一个家伙怎么了 
What happened to the other guy?


504
00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.060
搞定了
Took care of him.


505
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.040
我看太多了
Well, I've seen too much.


506
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.830
我还活着 这代表你决定信任我
I'm still alive, which must mean you've decided to trust me.


507
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.710
也许我不够狠
Or maybe I lost my edge.


508
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.460
你还是够狠
Edge is still intact.


509
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.170
发生一场冷战
There's a cold war.


510
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:12.590
核战 
Nuclear?


511
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.260
时间战争
Temporal.


512
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:16.550
时空旅行 
Time travel?


513
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.640
不
No.


514
00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:21.010
能够逆转物质中熵的科技
Technology that can invert an object's entropy.


515
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.560
你是指逆转时间
You mean reverse chronology.


516
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.910
就像费曼与惠勒的理论 正子只是时间逆行的电子 
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a positron is an electron


517
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.320
-我是物理硕士 -那就试着跟上罗
I have a master's in physics.


518
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.150
必须完全保密
Beyond secret.


519
00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.530
那为何找我来 
Then why'd you bring me in?


520
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.030
我以为只会找到一幅画和几盒子弹
I thought we'd find a drawing and a couple boxes of bullets.


521
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:41.160
我比你更惊讶
Not as surprised as I was.


522
00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.200
我要回孟买问个明白
I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers.


523
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.370
我会让你当中间人 但是记住 对你来说
I'll set you up as a go-between. But remember, to you...


524
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.840
任务是找到钚元素
it's all about plutonium.


525
00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.630
任务完成后 他们会杀你灭口
And when we're done, they'll kill you.


526
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:55.970
你不是会杀我灭口吗 
Won't you have to do that anyway?


527
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.130
我宁愿自己做决定
I'd rather it be my decision.


528
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:59.470
我也是
So would I.


529
00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.140
希望啦
I think.


530
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:14.020
你干的 
Your work?


531
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:14.940
运送金条货机撞毁

532
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:18.400
你在保险库找到什么 
What did you find in the vaults?


533
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:21.490
两个敌人 其中一个逆行
Two antagonists. One inverted.


534
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:25.290
我们除掉那个正常的 但逆行的逃走了
We took out the regular one, but the inverted one got away.


535
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.950
两人同时出现 
Both emerged at the same moment?


536
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.040
对
Yeah.


537
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.540
他们是同一个人
They were the same person.


538
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.460
萨托在保险库装了一道逆转门
Sator's built a turnstile in that vault.


539
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.670
逆转门 
Turnstile?


540
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.210
逆转时间的机器
A machine for inverting.


541
00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.010
你告诉我那项科技还没有被发明
You've told me that technology hasn't been invented yet.


542
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.640
是没有 是未来的人给他的
It hasn't.


543
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.640
你有机会查个明白
You have the best chance of finding out.


544
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.600
-见到他了吗  -差一点
-Have you met him?  -I was close.


545
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.650
-他需要什么…如果你需要  -比如说
-What if you have… something he needs?  - Such as?


546
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.860
钚-241
Plutonium-241.


547
00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.200
萨托试图从中情局小队那里 抢走唯一没登记的钚241
Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team


548
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.780
就是那次基辅歌剧院突击行动
at the opera siege in Kiev.


549
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.660
他杀了小队 但没拿到钚241
He got the team.


550
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:07.790
乌克兰国家安全局
Ukrainian Security Services.


551
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.120
一周内会运到塔林
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.


552
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:15.290
帮助军火商窃取武器级钚元素 是绝不能容许的 普莉亚
Helping an arms dealer steal weapons-grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya.


553
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.250
我只要把他干掉就行
I'm just gonna take him out.


554
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.670
不行 萨托必须活着
No, no, no. Sator has to stay alive.


555
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.470
直到我们知道他到底扮演什么角色
He has to stay alive until we know his part in things.


556
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.390
趁机查明真相 但不能失去钚241
Leverage the situation, without losing control of the 241.


557
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:27.850
太危险了
It's too dangerous.


558
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.310
恐怖份子的核弹 就算能杀死数十亿人口
A terrorist's bomb, even one that can kill billions,


559
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.150
但若不能阻止萨托 后果远比那更严重
is nothing compared with what will happen if we don't stop Sator.


560
00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.900
阻止他做什么 
From doing what?


561
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.690
我们遭到来自未来的攻击
We are being attacked by the future.


562
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.240
萨托在帮助他们 你得查出他的方法
And Sator's helping. You have to find out how.


563
00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.340
我看到奥斯陆的新闻 拿到画了吗 
I saw the news from Oslo. Do you have the drawing?


564
00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.090
你不必再担心了
You don't have to worry about it anymore.


565
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.890
你毁了那幅画 
You destroyed it?


566
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.260
我觉得你不会想要拿回来
I didn't think you'd want it back.


567
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.390
他知道吗 
Does he know?


568
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.060
还不知道 你先耐心等待
Not yet. So sit tight.


569
00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:11.180
耐心等待 
Sit tight?


570
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.750
我儿子和那禽兽相处愈久 就会愈来愈疏远我
Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me.


571
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.020
你不会等太久的 尽快把我介绍给他
It won't be long. In the meantime, introduce me.


572
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.530
以什么身分 
As what?


573
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.020
前任美国驻利雅德大使馆一等秘书
I'm a former first secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh.


574
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.200
我们去年6月在宴会上认识
We met at a party last June.


575
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.120
我们在利雅德参加过宴会 但不是在6月
We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don't think it was in June.


576
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.450
6月29日 7点或7点半
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.


577
00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.290
菜单上是鲑鱼 那晚改成鲈鱼
Salmon was on the printed menu. Swapped for sea bass on the night.


578
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.160
萨托提早离开 他走后我们才认识
Sator left early. That's when we met.


579
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:36.420
后来我去伦敦的薛普利拍卖行 你在这里遇见我
I came into Shipley's in London. You ran into me here


580
00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.130
想带我看你的游艇
and wanna show me your yacht.


581
00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.000
他会以为我们搞外遇
He'll think we're having an affair.


582
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:41.670
那他会更想见我
Then he'll wanna meet me.


583
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.720
或是杀了你
Or have you killed.


584
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.010
这一点不用你担心
Let me worry about that.


585
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.970
我看起来担心吗 
Did I look worried?


586
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:50.420
除了船员能睡70人 包括两架直升机 防御飞弹
Sleeps 70 with crew.


587
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.980
怕海盗吗 
Two helicopters. Missile defenses. Afraid of pirates?


588
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.440
安德烈和黑白两道打交道 得罪两边 这就是避难所
Andrei lives playing one government off the other.


589
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.770
我能跟你上船吗 
The day they turn, that's his refuge. May I join you?


590
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.440
瓦克夫不见得会允许
Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now.


591
00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:04.200
那就搭我的船
Then we'll take mine.


592
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:39.150
麦斯
Max!


593
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.860
那个美国人是谁

594
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.690
是个朋友

595
00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.570
他去过拍卖行
The man from Shipley's.


596
00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.910
你想找人痛扁他
Who you tried to have beaten up.


597
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:54.410
我再问一次 他是谁 
I ask again, who is he?


598
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.830
我们去年6月 在利雅德美国大使馆认识
We met in Riyadh last June at the American Embassy.


599
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.170
这个外交官的身手不错嘛
Good with fists for a diplomat.


600
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.340
你的疑心病太重了 安德烈
Paranoia's your department, Andrei.


601
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:07.630
他人很好 我邀他来共进晚餐

603
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.010
他去了庞贝和赫库兰尼姆
He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.


604
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:16.270
你就把他送走 我答应陪他去的
You just sent him off? I promised him I'd go with him.


605
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:18.770
我跟他说你在忙
I explained you were busy.


606
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:22.650
忙着陪朋友
With your friend.


607
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.010
别乱摸 要摸也得先请我吃晚饭

608
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.600
-萨托先生 -省省吧

老死

614
00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.620
你挑错行业了
You chose the wrong profession.

前面有一座有围墙的花园 我们要带你去 割断你咽喉
There's a walled garden up the road. We are going to take you there, cut your throat.


616
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.800
不是横割 是在中间割出一个洞
Not across. In the middle, like a hole.


617
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.470
然后割下你的蛋 塞进洞里面 塞爆气管
Then we take your balls and we stuff them in the cut,block the windpipe.


618
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.800
太复杂了
Complex.


619
00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.180
看着你讨厌的人在窒息而死之前

Is this how you treat all your guests?


622
00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.310
话讲完了
We're finished.


623

爱看歌剧吗 
Do you like opera?


624

又怎样 
Well?


625
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:56.700
这里不好讲话
Not here.


626
00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.120
会驾帆船吗 
You sail?


627
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.460
我随便玩过

630
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.940
麦斯今年缺课太多次了
Max has missed too much school this year.


631

我要带他回英国 学校不会容许他缺课这么多
I'm taking him back to England.


632
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.820
你虽然富可敌国
You have all the trappings of a king.


633
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.610
但只是在玩权力游戏的奸诈小人
We both know you're a grubby little man playing power games

638
00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:54.720
你担心那幅画被毁了 
Were you worried it had been destroyed?


639
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.930
放心 我的直觉告诉我 把它从保险库拿出来
Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault.


640
00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.810
我对未来总是有敏锐的直觉
I've always had instincts about the future.


641
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:06.730

That's how I built this life you no longer value.


642

那座基地被夺回来
When the station was retaken,


648
00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:20.680
但核弹弹头的钚241 却少了3/4公斤

649
00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:26.680
丢失的钚241

我不会跟你合伙

655
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.050
你懂得怎么自保 没留下任何纪录
You can take care of yourself. You have no record.


656
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.180
受过训练的军火商 知道怎么掩盖自己的痕迹
Someone in the arms trade, with training, who knows how to cover his tracks.


657
00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.510

你不能这样驾船

665
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:57.190
卖枪给他 
What, to sell guns?


666
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:58.570
我不是你想的那种人
I'm not who you think I am.


667
00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:01.570
我知道 他给我看了那幅画

我不知道你以为你先生在做什么
I don't know what you think your husband does...


670
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.580
大家都知道他是军火商
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.


671
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.910

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:16.860
安德烈萨托掌控全人类的性命 不只是你的
Andrei Sator holds all of our lives in his hands, not just yours.


674
00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.760
萨托先生要见你
Mr. Sator wants to see you.


675
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:26.760
好
Okay.


676
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.470
现在
Now.


677
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:31.770
他要看到我没穿裤子 
Uh, he wants to see me without pants?


678
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:38.650
相信我
- Trust me. - Save it.


679
00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.350
省省吧 我不会再上第二次当
I'm not falling for it twice.


680
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.410
你有更好的选择 
You have a better option?


681
00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.240
你会不择手段得到你要的
Whatever it takes to get what you want.


682
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.830
根本不会管我跟儿子的死活
Not a second's thought for me or my son.


683
00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.670
你觉得他会怎么对付我 
What do you think he's gonna do to me now?


684
01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.560
尽量别用它
Try not to use it.


685
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.230
别对任何人开枪
On anyone.


686
01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:22.990
够了
Enough.


687
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.530
瞧 我和年轻小伙子一样健康
See? Pulse of a man half my age.


688
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.410
陪我喝酒
Drink with me.


689
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.420
看来我欠你一条命
It seems I now owe you my life.


690
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:39.790
小事一件
It's nothing.


691
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.750
我的命可不是小事
My life is not nothing.


692
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.340
我也不喜欢亏欠别人
And I don't like to be in debt.


693
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.720
那就回报我 别报复你老婆
Then pay me. No retribution against your wife.


694
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.560
你以为是她松开我的安全索 
You think she released my harness?


695
01:00:57.850 --> 01:00:59.650
那是我自己的错
It was my own mistake.


696
01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:02.230
那就帮我偷走钚241
Then help me steal the 241.


697
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.740
我需要资源 那是武器化的钚元素
I need resources. It's weapons-grade plutonium.


698
01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.820
必须小心处理 也需要封隔设施
That means special handling, containment facilities...


699
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.320
我很清楚
I know what it means.


700
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.490
你要教我幅射的危险 
You lecture me about radiation?


701
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:16.370
安德烈萨托
Andrei Sator,


702
01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.090
从年少就在废墟中挖掘钚元素
digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager.


703
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:22.090
在哪里 
Where?


704
01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.800
史托斯克12市
Stalsk-12.


705
01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300
我的家乡
My home.


706
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:36.810
一枚核弹在地面引爆 碎片四处散落
One part of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others.


707
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.980
政府需要有人找到钚元素
They needed people to find the plutonium.


708
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:46.650
那是我第一笔生意 没人敢竞标
It became my first contract.


709
01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.740
他们都觉得必死无疑
Nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence.


710
01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:52.370
但是
But...


711
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.950
一个人死亡的可能
one man's probability of death...


712
01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.830
安德烈萨托

713
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.340
却是另一个人存活的可能
...is another man's possibility for a life.


714
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.090
我在全新俄罗斯占有一席之地
I staked my claim in the new Russia.


715
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.890
直到现在 只有我的公司能在废墟中作业
Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins.


716
01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:16.890
钚241经由欧洲北部被运送到
The 241 is being transported through northern Europe,


717
01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:21.520
位于第里雅斯特的长期核武库
on its way to the long-term nuclear storage depot in Trieste.


718
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.690
听说你在塔林有人脉
I'm told you have resources in Tallinn.


719
01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:31.740
留下来过夜
Stay with us tonight.


720
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.530
我坚持
I insist.


721
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.100
你想干嘛 
What do you want?


722
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:04.270
好好谈谈今天的事
We're going to talk about today.


723
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:06.230
才不要
No, we're not.


724
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400
不要 
No?


725
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.440
走着瞧
We'll see.


726
01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:14.570
别以为你能像 对付别的女人一样对付我
Don't think for a second you can treat me like you treat your other women.


727
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:18.450
那么
And, uh...


728
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:23.920
你以为 我是怎么对付别的女人 
how do you imagine...I treat these other women, huh?


729
01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.540
我会逼她们乖乖说话 
You think I force them into conversation?


730
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:29.880
你不想说没关系 用力咬着吧
You wanna be quiet, fine.You can bite down on that.


731
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.430
就连你空洞的灵魂也需要填补
Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response.


732
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:40.020
光是恐惧和痛苦够吗 
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?


733
01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.480
我只能给你这些
That's all I have to offer you.


734
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.100
那就够了
Well, that will have to do, then.


735
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:45.860
你为什么不放过我 
Why didn't you just let me go?


736
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.020
因为
Because...


737
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:54.700
如果我不能拥有你
if I can't have you...


738
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.780
别人也休想拥有你
no one else can.


739
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.040
你敢碰我 我会叫到他听见
And if you touch me, I scream so loud he hears.


740
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.000
我会让他插手吗 
You think I let him interfere?


741
01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.590
他敢的话 你就得杀了他
If he tried, you'd have to kill him.


742
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:09.000
生意一笔勾销
End of deal.


743
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:12.840
所以你最好别碰我
So you leave me alone.


744
01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.090
别来烦我
Not now!


745
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:40.150
98下 扁人后脉博还这么稳真不赖
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion.


746
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:53.000
他在窗口偷看
He was at the window.


747
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:55.920
我只是好奇
I was curious.


748
01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:00.130
你不该对我的货好奇
My property shouldn't concern you.


749
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.880
你是什么人 
Who are you?


750
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:04.220
怎会知道歌剧院的事 
How do you come by your information about the opera?


751
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:08.560
你不会跟个不够聪明的 中情局干员做生意吧 
You wouldn't do business with someone who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.


752
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.730
中情局提供市场上2/3的核原料
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds of the market for fissile material.


753
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:14.610
他们通常是买家 不是卖家
They're usually buying, not selling.


754
01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:18.230
但我们活在一个暮光世界
But we do live in a twilight world.


755
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.030
惠特曼的诗句 很优美
Is that Whitman? Pretty.


756
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:22.200
下一个警告就是脑袋吃子弹
Next warning's a bullet in the brain.


757
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:25.870
不是咽喉里塞卵蛋 
No balls in my throat?


758
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:30.410
到了塔林就没有时间搞这种事
There will be no time for such things... in Tallinn.


759
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.630
你设法去那里 我要瓦克夫加入你小组
You make your way there. I want Volkov on your team.


760
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.960
办不到
No.


761
01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.760
我负责偷货 你负责给钱
I spring the material. You pay me off.


762
01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.430
你太太负责交易
Your wife does the exchange.


763
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:46.050
我从不让她涉入我的生意
I never involve her in my business.


764
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.810
所以我才信任她
Yeah, that's why I trust her.


765
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.720
送他上岸
Put him ashore.


766
01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.480
我要怎么联络你 
How do I contact you?


767
01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.480
你不能
You don't.


768
01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.230
你要怎么付我头期款 
How do you advance me the funds?


769
01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:01.070
你最好别把钚元素掉地上
Handle the plutonium better than that.


770
01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.410
金条上面发现什么 
What did you find on the gold?


771
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500
没印记 没模具痕迹 啥都没有
No franks, no mold marks. Nothing.


772
01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.540
-哪儿来的  -情报点
- How? - Dead drops.


773
01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.090
他埋下时空胶囊 传送位置
He buries his time capsule, transmits the location,


774
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:23.510
然后挖出未来送来的逆转物品
then digs it up to collect the inverted materials they sent.


775
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.640
一瞬间就送到 他埋在哪里 
Seemingly instantaneous. Where's he bury it?


776
01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.720
几世纪都不会被发现的地方
Some place that won't be discovered for centuries.


777
01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:31.770
土壤分析显示什么 
What did the soil samples show?


778
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:35.560
欧洲北部 亚洲 有放射性
Northern Europe, Asia.


779
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.520
为何找我来 
Why am I here?


780
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:43.820
我不信任别人进行监定
I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces.


781
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:46.820
车队会经过市区 你觉得怎样 
Via convoy through downtown, what's the thinking?


782
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.120
马路太拥挤 车况很难预料
Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns.


783
01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.290
几乎不可能策划突袭行动
It's almost impossible to plan an ambush.


784
01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:54.080
说得有道理
They have a point.


785
01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:56.250
他们从空中监视车队 
Is the convoy monitored from the air?


786
01:08:56.330 --> 01:09:00.000
GPS定位 转错一个弯 大队人马就会赶来
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn, in come the cavalry.


787
01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:01.340
我们需要重装武器
We need big guns.


788
01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.840
可以展示武力 也不必开火
Guns that make the point without being fired.


789
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.010
我们需要一辆看起来不快的快车
We need a fast car that doesn't look fast. 


790
01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.510
四辆重型车
Four heavy vehicles.


791
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.510
公共汽车  长途汽车  18轮车  
A bus, coach,18 wheeler.


792
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:10.510
其中一个必须是消防车
One of them has to be a fire truck.


793
01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.430
最重要的是绝对不能留下任何纪录
Most of all, we have to set this up with nothing in the record.


794
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.390
电子和纸本都不行
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.


795
01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.690
把货偷走后不能让萨托突袭我们
I don't want Sator ambushing us once we spring the material.


796
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.490
他被蒙在鼓里我们才安全
His ignorance is our only protection.


797
01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.330
自由港

798
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.320
看到吗 凯特 
You see, Kat?


799
01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.530
一些我的最爱
Some of my favorites.


800
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:12.910
被烧过但仍能用 对吧 
Singed but, uh, salvageable, wouldn't you say?


801
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.910
那不是我的专长
- That's not my area of expertise.


802
01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.530
没错 你跟这种事不会有关系
Ah, that's right.You would never have anything to do with such things.


803
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.500
但我们的世界在此碰撞
But this is where our worlds collide.


804
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:24.300
这是什么 安德烈 
What is this, Andrei?


805
01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.420
你心知肚明 凯特
You know perfectly well what it is, Kat.


806
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.050
这门肮脏龌龊的生意
The filthy business


807
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.640
让你穿得光鲜亮丽 也让我们儿子念名校
that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school,


808
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.230
你还以为是你靠关系得来的
that you thought you could negotiate your way around.


809
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.040
车队10分钟后抵达市区

810
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:49.240
该走了
Time to go.


811
01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.780
我才不会跟他走
I'm not going anywhere with him.


812
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.200
看着我
Look at me!


813
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:58.330
搞清楚一件事 你不能与虎谋皮
And understand, you don't negotiate with a tiger.


814
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:02.500
只能欣赏他 直到他反扑
You admire a tiger until he turns on you


815
01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:07.090
就会知道他有多威猛
and you feel its true fucking nature!


816
01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.670
别过来
Don't.


817
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.760
给我待在那里
You stay right there.


818
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:17.720
绿组 两分钟
Green. Two minutes.


819
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:42.580
你不会杀我
You are not going to kill me.


820
01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:44.420
我已经试过了
I already tried.


821
01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.130
你只敢把我推下船 而没胆冷血拿枪杀我
You pushed me off a boat. You are not going to shoot me in cold blood.


822
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.510
我的血在沸腾 安德烈
My blood's not cold, Andrei.


823
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:53.800
对 但你不够愤怒
No, but you're not angry enough.


824
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:58.970
因为愤怒会变成绝望
Because anger scars over into despair.


825
01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.270
我看着你的双眼
I look in your eyes...


826
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:06.400
只看到绝望
I see despair.


827
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:13.400
贱女人 只会靠我养
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!


828
01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:16.740
我还以为你没这么贱 够了
Thinking that you're better! Enough!


829
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:43.560
告诉我发生的一切
Tell me everything as it happens.


830
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:47.770
把我锁在这一边
Seal me this side.


831
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.290
黄组 60秒
Yellow, 60 seconds.


832
01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.000
60秒 收到

833
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:26.230
蓝组 45秒

834
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.230
蓝组 45秒 收到
Blue, 45, check.


835
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:47.120
红组正开向你
Okay, Red. Coming to you.


836
01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.810
三台货车到位

837
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:05.100
观察一切 向我回报
Watch everything. Give me all the details.


838
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:51.730
大家准备好了吗 
All right, everyone set?


839
01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:59.490


840
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.780


841
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.700


842
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:05.830


843
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000


844
01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:32.770
上吧 黄组
Go, Yellow!


845
01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.610
出了问题
We got a problem!


846
01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:40.740
我们需要支援 靠
Backup, we need backup! Shit!


847
01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.260
无线电失效

848
01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.610
他们还在移动吗

849
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.200
仔细听无线电对话
Check the radio chatter.


850
01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:09.930
我看过每种武器等级的容器 这不是其中之一
I've seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class. This is not one of them.


851
01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:11.680
那就是他要的
That's what he's after.


852
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:16.640
我听不懂
Can't understand this.


853
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:18.310
你说你懂爱沙尼亚语
You said you spoke Estonian.


854
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:22.190
这不是爱沙尼亚语 是倒着说的话
It's not Estonian. It's backwards.


855
01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:27.700
那是怎么回事 
The hell is that?


856
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.340
快 快
Go, go, go!


857
01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.430
别交给他
Don't give it to him.


858
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:36.060
-这不是钚元素 -这更可怕 该死
This isn't plutonium. It's worse than that, God damn it!


859
01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.320
抱歉
Sorry.


860
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:12.550
他逃走了
He's getting away.


861
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:15.680
他把她留在车上
He left her in the car!


862
01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.060
快追上她 快啊
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!


863
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:32.700
开到旁边
Pull up alongside!


864
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.840
快啊 靠近一点
Come on, come on. Closer!


865
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.220
稳住 稳住
Keep it steady, keep it steady!


866
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:59.930
快点
Hurry up!


867
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:02.600
拜托
Please!


868
01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:41.470
别着急 我要呼叫救兵
All right, sit tight. I'm calling the cavalry.


869
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:43.680
哪来的救兵 
What cavalry?


870
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.210
你不说实话她就死
If you are not telling the truth, she dies.


871
01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.250
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.


872
01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.460
你放在车上 不是消防车上 对吧 
You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?


873
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:59.720
谁跟你说的 
- Who told you that? - Just tell me now,


874
01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.290
老实说 真的在BMW车上吗 
is it really in the BMW?


875
01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:03.890
不知道
I don't know.


876
01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:05.640
你不说我就再开枪
Tell me or I'll shoot her again!


877
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:08.390
放了她
Leave her alone!


878
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.940
杀了他
Kill him!


879
01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.940
我没空跟你耗
I don't have time to negotiate.


880
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:18.610
-听我说 -3
- Listen to me! - Three.


881
01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:19.700
我能帮你
I can help you.


882
01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.070
-救救我 -2
- Help me! - Two.


883
01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.200
拜托
Please!


884
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.410
-不要 -1
- Don't! - One.


885
01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:29.460
下一枪就脑袋开花
Next one's a bullet to the head.


886
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.540
-不 -1
- No! - One.


887
01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:34.250
2、3
Two. Three.


888
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.590
好啦 好啦
Okay! Okay.


889
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:41.180
-我放在那辆BMW上 -我们要检查是不是真的
The car. The BMW. I left it in the BMW. We're going to check this is real.


890
01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:45.180
在手套箱里
It's in the glove box!


891
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.930
你放在哪里 
Where did you leave it?


892
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:51.100
轿车或消防车 哪一台 
Car or fire truck, which one?


893
01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:53.650
你放在哪一台车上  我去之前得知道
Which vehicle did you leave it in? I need to know before I go out there.


894
01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:54.650
我告诉你了
I already told you.


895
01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:57.190
我相信你
I believe you.


896
01:23:57.570 --> 01:24:00.110
你要她 那就祝你们幸福
You wanted her here, I hope you'll be happy...


897
01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.120
安全
Clear!


898
01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.170
惠勒 检查另一边
Wheeler, go check the other side.


899
01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:16.590
你们两个
You two.


900
01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:17.840
他跑去哪了 
Where did he go?


901
01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:18.960
过去
The past.


902
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.530
在手套箱里
It's in the glove box!


903
01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:46.030
我们要检查是不是真的
We're going to check this is real.


904
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.660
-3 2 1 -好啦
- Three, two, one. - Okay, okay...


905
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:54.080
下一枪就脑袋开花
Next one's a bullet to the head.


906
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:57.040
-不 -1
- No! No! - One.


907
01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:58.710
-听我说 -2
- Listen to me. - Two.


908
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.000


909
01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.880
我能帮你
I can help you.


910
01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:03.300
我没空跟你耗
I don't have time to negotiate.


911
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:05.590
你不说我就再开枪
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.


912
01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.510
-放了她 -老实说 真的在BMW车上吗 
- Leave her alone! - Tell me now,


913
01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:14.250
你放在车上 不是消防车上 对吧 
You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right?


914
01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:15.060
谁跟你说的 
Who told you that?


915
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.560
你不说实话她就死
If you're not telling the truth, she dies.


916
01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:19.400
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.


917
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:33.080
-医护人员 -到了
- Medic! - Check in.


918
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.170
她遭到枪伤 
She's been shot?


919
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.080
把她带回这一边
Bring her back, this side.


920
01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:41.460
她被逆转子弹射伤吗 
Was she shot with an inverted round?


921
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.890
这是艾佛斯 他是自己人
This is Ives. He's one of us.


922
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.140
自己人 这些人是谁 
"Us"! Who are these guys?


923
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:54.390
普莉亚的人 我们的人
Priya's. Ours.


924
01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.060
萨托怎么会知道突袭行动 
How did Sator know about the ambush?


925
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.440
有留下纪录
It's posterity.


926
01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:00.630
光天化日下的突袭行动 不可能没有纪录
An ambush in the middle of the street can't stay out of the records.


927
01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:03.150
屁啦 他知道我们的一举一动 每一个细节都知道
Bullshit! He knew every move we made! Every one of 'em.


928
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:05.150
有人告密 是谁 是你吗 
Somebody talked. Who was it?


929
01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.240
不是
- Was it you? - No. No.


930
01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:11.700
你在每一个阶段都知道太多 我再问你一次
At every stage, you've known too much. I'm going to ask you again.


931
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.620
你有没有告密 
Did you talk?


932
01:26:16.290 --> 01:26:20.290
没人告密 他们展开时间钳形攻势
Nobody talked. They're running a temporal pincer movement.


933
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.090
什么 
A what?


934
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:26.170
钳形攻势 不是空间 而是时间
The pincer movement. But not in space, in time.


935
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.010
他一半的组员顺着时间前进
Half his team moves forward through the event.


936
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:32.010
他先监控他们 最后再逆转时间展开攻击
He monitors them, and then attacks at the end moving backwards,


937
01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:33.560
那时他已知道一切
knowing everything.


938
01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.180
除了我把钚元素藏在哪里
Except for where I stashed the plutonium.


939
01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:37.600
那并不是钚元素 对吧 
Which isn't really plutonium, is it?


940
01:26:37.690 --> 01:26:41.440
我说过那是他要的东西 你也告诉他东西在哪
I told you it was what he was after. And you just told him where it was.


941
01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.730
我撒了谎
I lied.


942
01:26:45.570 --> 01:26:47.780
天啊 你连这件事也撒谎 
Jesus. You lied about it?


943
01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.120
他没办法在房间内确认 反正他还是会射杀她
He couldn't verify inside the room. He'd have shot her anyway.


944
01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.200
撒谎是标准行动程序
Lying is standard operating procedure.


945
01:26:54.330 --> 01:26:55.450
伤口扩散得太大
It's spread too far.


946
01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:56.870
什么意思 
Meaning what?


947
01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.370
她快死了
She's gonna die.


948
01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.120
标准行动程序
Standard operating procedure.


949
01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:02.130
救不了吗 我们不能做点什么 
Can't you help her? Can we do something?


950
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.050
不能逆转病患然后稳定逆转辐射 
Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation by inverting the patient?


951
01:27:05.130 --> 01:27:06.260
要花好几天
Takes days.


952
01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.170
走吧
Let's go.


953
01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.940
我们几分钟前才掌控这台机器 之前是萨托的
We took control of this machine minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.


954
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:12.600
她在这一边能活多久 
How long is she gonna live on this side?


955
01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.260
最多3个钟头
Three hours, tops.


956
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:15.930
我要带她过去
I'm taking her through.


957
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:18.180
我不会让她死 我愿意冒险
I'm not gonna let her die. I'll take my chances.


958
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:20.310
没办法把你带回来
There's no way of bringing you back.


959
01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:22.150
我们会找到另一台机器
We find another machine.


960
01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:23.650
一星期前 在哪里 
A week ago? Where?


961
01:27:25.730 --> 01:27:27.230
奥斯陆
Oslo.


962
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.160
那在机场安检范围内的仓库 闯不进去的
That facility's inside an airport security perimeter. It's impregnable.


963
01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.660
上个星期就可以
Mmm... It wasn't last week.


964
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:36.870
我们要闯进去 你还会帮我们吧
We're going in. You might as well help us.


965
01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.790
这是反照窗 当你走向逆转门
This is a proving window. As you approach the turnstile,


966
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:43.830
要是在反照窗内看不到自己 就别进去机器里
if you don't see yourself in the proving window,


967
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.590
看不到逆行的自己走出逆转门 就代表你出不来
If you don't see yourself reverse-exit a machine,


968
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:52.050
你自己看
See for yourself.


969
01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.100
这就是答案 走吧
There's your answer. Let's go.


970
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:22.080
她慢慢稳定下来 伤口缝合了 只需要时间康复
She's stabilizing slowly. I'll clean and close, but the rest is time.


971
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.420
需要多少时间 
How long does she need?


972
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.790
4 5天 一星期最保险
Four, five days. A week to be sure.


973
01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.920
尼尔 设法带我们去奥斯陆 我要再出去
Hey, Neil. Find a way to get us to Oslo. I'm going back out there.


974
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.930
去做什么 
To do what?


975
01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:36.120
阻止萨托拿着我给他的东西逃走
To stop Sator from getting away with whatever it is I just gave him.


976
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.010
你没给他 你骗他东西在哪里 等等
You didn't. You lied about where it was. Wait.


977
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.100
你是为了她回去
You're going out there for her.


978
01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:42.690
他在过去威胁要杀她
He threatened to kill her in the past.


979
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:44.650
若真的下手 她现在会怎样 
If he does, what happens to her here?


980
01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.820
无从得知
That's unknowable.


981
01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:50.150
你若想去改变过去 就不是在这里观察后果
If you're there to make a change, you're not here to observe its effect.


982
01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:51.530
你相信什么 
What do you believe?


983
01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:53.820
发生过的已经发生了
What's happened's happened.


984
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:56.780
我们必须在此时此刻救她
We need to save her, here and now.


985
01:28:56.950 --> 01:29:00.490
你若是再出去 就会双手奉上他要的东西
If you go back out there, you might hand him exactly what he's after.


986
01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.500
别让他们把她带回去 好吗 
Don't let them take her back through there.


987
01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.960
时间不多了
We don't have a lot of time.


988
01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:13.670
你何不替我们找个刚从奥斯陆运来 舒舒服服的货柜 
So why don't you find us a nice, cozy shipping container that's just come off a ship from Oslo?


989
01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.130
这么做太莽撞了
This is cowboy shit.


990
01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:17.890
你一旦走出那道门 就不知道会惹上什么麻烦
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into


991
01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:21.220
惠勒 告诉他
Wheeler, brief him.


992
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:23.270
你会需要自己的氧气瓶
You'll need your own air.


993
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:26.600
这里的氧气无法进入逆转的肺膜
Regular air won't pass through the membranes of inverted lungs.


994
01:29:26.770 --> 01:29:30.650
第一条规则 别接触顺时间前进的自己
Number one rule: don't come into contact with your forward self.


995
01:29:30.730 --> 01:29:33.360
所以才需要这些屏障和防护衣
It's the whole point of these barriers and protective suits.


996
01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.820
我们没有时间了
We don't have time.


997
01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.030
你的粒子若是接触到
Well, if your particles come into contact...


998
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.120
会怎样 
What?


999
01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.240
全人类灭绝
Annihilation.


1000
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:41.290
那就糟糕了 对吧 
That would be bad, right?


1001
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:45.160
走出气闸后 花点时间适应环境
When you exit the air lock, take a moment to orient yourself.


1002
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.370
一切都会感觉很奇怪
Things will feel strange.


1003
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:49.880
当你奔跑 风会从你后面吹来
When you run, the wind will be at your back.


1004
01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:54.840
当你碰到火 衣服上会结冰 因为热传导被逆转了
You encounter fire, ice will form on your clothes as the transfer of heat is reversed.


1005
01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:58.970
地心引力会是正常的 但周遭的世界将是逆转的
Gravity will feel normal but appear reversed for the world around you.


1006
01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:03.850
你的视觉和听觉会受到扭曲 这是正常的
You may experience distortions in your vision and hearing.


1007
01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:07.390
我不能保证你会有操控性
I can't vouch for the handling.


1008
01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.690
摩擦力和风阻都被逆转
Friction and wind resistance are reversed.


1009
01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:11.980
你也被逆转 但这世界并没有
You are inverted. The world is not.


1010
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:13.690
收发器在公事箱上面吗 
Was the transponder on the case?


1011
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.530
我们把它给丢了
We've tossed that case.


1012
01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:18.280
我逆向时间移动 所以必须遵循这个准则
I'm moving backwards. It's the ball I have to follow.


1013
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.990
把追踪器给我
Give me the reader.


1014
01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.330
好吧
Okay.


1015
01:30:26.370 --> 01:30:27.670
准备好了吗 
You ready?


1016
01:31:57.630 --> 01:32:02.300
追踪中

1017
01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.130
标准标记

1018
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:21.920
东西不在里面
The material's not in the case.


1019
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.720
把演算机的其它部分带去震源
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.


1020
01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:29.510
他撒了谎 东西不在BMW上
He was lying. It wasn't in the BMW.


1021
01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.020
到底在哪里 
So, where is it?


1022
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:18.980
我看到交换过程
I saw the handoff.


1023
01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:21.610
你害我白白射伤她
You made me shoot her for nothing.


1024
01:34:22.530 --> 01:34:26.320
你倒是让我的脉搏飙到130 没有人做到这一点
You did get my pulse above 130, no one's done that before.


1025
01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.070
就连我老婆也没有
Not even my wife.


1026
01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:00.270
艾佛斯和他的小组留下来清理现场
You left Ives and his team a hell of a cleanup.


1027
01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.570
热传导被逆转
Heat transfer was reversed.


1028
01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.400
你可能是史上第一个 因为爆炸导致失温的案例
You might be the first case of hypothermia from a gasoline explosion in history.


1029
01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:11.370
我已经见怪不怪了
At this point, nothing surprises.


1030
01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.080
我们正在回奥斯陆 
We're headed back to Oslo?


1031
01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.040
在路特速的货柜里
In a Rotas shipping container.


1032
01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:17.910
他拿到东西了 尼尔
He's got the material, Neil.


1033
01:35:18.330 --> 01:35:20.170
我双手奉上它
I handed it to him on a plate.


1034
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:21.960
我警告过你
I warned you...


1035
01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.800
发生过的事已经发生了 我现在知道了
What's happened's happened. I get it now.


1036
01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.590
但我很难相信说话模棱两可的人
But it's hard to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths.


1037
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:29.880
这么说不公平
That's not fair.


1038
01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:31.970
你在我们见面前就参一脚
You were a part of this before we met.


1039
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.430
你替普莉亚工作 
Were you working for Priya?


1040
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:34.470
不是
No.


1041
01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:39.850
现在知道对你没啥好处
It can't possibly do you any good to know that right now.


1042
01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:44.860
等这一切过去 我们还活着 你也还在乎
When this is over, if we're still standing, and you still care,


1043
01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.650
我就告诉你我的人生故事
then you can hear my life story, okay?


1044
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:51.660
很抱歉拖你下水
I'm sorry I involved you.


1045
01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:53.620
你得告诉我是怎么回事
You need to tell me what's going on.


1046
01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.410
尼尔知道的显然比我多
Apparently Neil here knows more about it than I do.


1047
01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.580
祝好运 老兄
Good luck, pal.


1048
01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:01.200
告诉凯特任何事 普莉亚就会认为她是风险
By telling Kat anything, we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.


1049
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:03.250
普莉亚早就这么认为了
In Priya's eyes, she's already compromised.


1050
01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:05.710
她有权知道为何自己可能会死
She has the right to know why she might die.


1051
01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:06.880
我会死吗 
Am I gonna die?


1052
01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:08.550
我们能帮你就不会
Not if we have something to say about it.


1053
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:09.630
我们能帮你
And we do.


1054
01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.380
你是谁 
Who are you?


1055
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:16.010
先从简单的开始 每条物理定律
Let's start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics...


1056
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:24.270
东西不在里面
The material's not in the case.


1057
01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.610
把演算机的其它部分带去震源
Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter.


1058
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:37.790
你受伤了 
You injured?


1059
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:45.580
演算机是什么 尼尔 
What's the algorithm, Neil?


1060
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:50.630
钚241是九个部分的其中一个

1061
01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:56.550
那是以物体呈现的分子式 所以不会被复制或以语言传递
It's a formula rendered into physical form so it can't be copied or communicated.


1062
01:36:57.010 --> 01:36:59.270
那是只有一个功能的黑盒子
It's a black box with one function.


1063
01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.060
什么功能 
Which is?


1064
01:37:01.930 --> 01:37:04.690
逆转时间 但不是逆转物体或人
Inversion. But not objects or peoples.


1065
01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:06.020
而是我们周遭的世界
The world around us.


1066
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:07.110
我不懂
I don't understand.


1067
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:10.870
当他们逆转更多物体的熵
As they invert the entropy of more and more objects,


1068
01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:14.200
向前和向后的时间 就会愈来愈纠结
the two directions of time are becoming more intertwined.


1069
01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:17.410
但由于世界基本上还是向前运作
But because the environment essentially flows in our direction...


1070
01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:18.910
我们就能掌控时间
we dominate.


1071
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:21.870
其他人总是逆流泅泳 那才救了你的命
They're always swimming upstream.


1072
01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.080
就像是迎风撒尿
Pissing in the wind.


1073
01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:29.170
演算机能够改变风向
And the algorithm can change the direction of that wind.


1074
01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:31.840
它能逆转全世界的熵
It can invert the entropy of the world.


1075
01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.380
那会怎样 
And if that happens?


1076
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:39.100
游戏结束 能说得更清楚吗 
"End of play." Can you be a little more precise?


1077
01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:43.890
曾经活过的每个人和一切 都会立刻毁灭 够清楚了吧 
Everyone and everything that's ever lived, destroyed. Instantly.


1078
01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:51.940
你睡得越久 就会越快康复
The more you sleep, the faster you'll heal.


1079
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:09.040
在货车上了
On a truck.


1080
01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:12.710
应该就快到了
Shouldn't be long now.


1081
01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:18.010
我一直在想 我们是他们的祖先
I've been thinking. We're their ancestors.


1082
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.720
他们毁灭我们不也毁灭了自己 
If they destroy us, won't that destroy them?


1083
01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:23.310
这就要提到祖父悖论
This brings us to the grandfather paradox.


1084
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:24.640
什么 
The what?


1085
01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:28.400
假如你回到过去把自己祖父杀掉
If you went back in time


1086
01:38:30.730 --> 01:38:31.650
答案是什么 
What's the answer?


1087
01:38:31.730 --> 01:38:33.320
没有答案 这是悖论
There's no answer. It's a paradox.


1088
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.900
但是在未来 当权者显然相信你能
But in the future, those in power clearly believe that you can


1089
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:40.160
把你祖父踢下楼梯 挖出他的眼珠
kick grandpa down the stairs, gouge his eyes out,


1090
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:43.080
切断他的喉咙 却没有任何后果
slit his throat, without consequence.


1091
01:38:43.410 --> 01:38:45.040
他们有可能对吗 
Could they be right?


1092
01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.580
不重要 他们深信不疑
Doesn't matter. They believe it.


1093
01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:50.840
而且愿意毁灭我们
So they're willing to destroy us.


1094
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:54.090
我要继续睡觉了
Can I go back to sleep now?


1095
01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:55.670
不行 我又想到另一件事
No. I thought of something else.


1096
01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.590
太好了
Great.


1097
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.720
像这样逆转时间
This reversing the flow of time.


1098
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.680
我们此刻身在此处 岂不代表从未发生 
Doesn't us being here now mean it never happens?


1099
01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.140
因为我们阻止了他们 
That we stop them?


1100
01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:05.890
乐观来说 我认为是对的
Optimistically, I'd say that's right.


1101
01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.690
悲观来说呢 
Pessimistically?


1102
01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:10.860
在平行世界理论中 我们不可能知道
In a parallel worlds theory, we can't know the relationship


1103
01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:13.690
意识和多重现实的关系
between consciousness and multiple realities.


1104
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.110
你开始头痛了吗 
Does your head hurt yet?


1105
01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.440
当然
Yes.


1106
01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:21.820
试着睡觉吧
Try to sleep.


1107
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.050
靠
Shit.


1108
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:41.430
他们没载我们进去
They didn't take us inside.


1109
01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.310
该怎么办 
What do we do?


1110
01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.680
我们从破口进去
We use the breach.


1111
01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:51.100
撞上去后趁乱行动 准备好
The chaos right after impact. Get ready.


1112
01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.440
她的伤好了吗 
She healed enough?


1113
01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.700
不知道 我从来没做过这种事
I don't know. I've never done this before.


1114
01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.740
消防队来了 带凯特从破口进去
The fire crew's there.


1115
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:07.450
你再带她进来
Then you bring her in.


1116
01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.160
你的伤怎样 
How's your arm?


1117
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:11.710
不太妙
Not good.


1118
01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:18.210
听到引擎爆炸后马上行动
We move as soon as we hear the engines.


1119
01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.800
-等等 -怎么了 
- Hold on, hold on. - What?


1120
01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.100
你在流血
You're bleeding.


1121
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:26.760
来 让我看看
All right, let me take a look at it.


1122
01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:34.860
好了吗 
Ready?


1123
01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:09.270
在这儿等 我要进去
Wait here. I'm going in.


1124
01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:07.760
快啊
Come on!


1125
01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:09.260
快走
Go, go, go!


1126
01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:40.920
快走
Go!


1127
01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.860
你明知是我从保险库出来 干嘛不说 
You knew it was me coming out of that vault.


1128
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:33.490
事实不会改变 我知道你不会有事
Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay.


1129
01:45:33.650 --> 01:45:35.200
发生过的已经发生了
What's happened's happened.


1130
01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.450
我若先说 你又改变作法 谁知道会怎样 
If I told you and you acted differently, who knows?


1131
01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.250
规定是不能说
The policy is to suppress.


1132
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:44.500
谁规定的 
Whose policy?


1133
01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:45.880
我们啊 朋友
Ours, my friend.


1134
01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:52.510
我们要拯救走向灭亡的世界
We're the people saving the world from what might've been.


1135
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.270
凯特
Kat?


1136
01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:05.480
我在这儿
I'm here.


1137
01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.320
伤疤会很大 你不会有事
It'll be quite a scar. You'll be okay.


1138
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:12.740
搞定了
Did it.


1139
01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:14.450
搞定了什么 
You did what?


1140
01:46:15.150 --> 01:46:16.780
安德烈拿到演算机
Andrei has the algorithm.


1141
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:19.740
你不知道他在哪里
You don't know where he is.


1142
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:23.120
或哪个时空
Or when.


1143
01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.870
-把普莉亚带来奥斯陆 -为什么 
- Get Priya here to Oslo. - Why?


1144
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.790
若我不做点什么 两天后她就会告诉我钚241的事
If I don't do something, in two days, she tells me about the 241.


1145
01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.050
那是无法改变的
Nothing can change that.


1146
01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:32.380
等着瞧
We'll see.


1147
01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:34.510
把她带来
Just get her here.


1148
01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:38.050
你好 普莉亚
Hello, Priya.


1149
01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.930
怎么回事 尼尔呢 
What's going on?


1150
01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:46.940
我做了什么 
What did I do?


1151
01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:50.110
是你打算做什么 两天后你会派我把钚241
It's what you're going to do. In two days, you're gonna have me dangle plutonium-241


1152
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:53.820
拿到世上最危险的军火商面前当钓饵
in front of the world's most dangerous arms dealer.


1153
01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.900
我想要知道原因
Now, I wanna know why.


1154
01:46:55.150 --> 01:46:57.280
你让萨托拿到钚241 
You let Sator get hold of 241?


1155
01:46:57.450 --> 01:46:59.200
不 我让他拿到演算机
No, I let him get ahold of the algorithm.


1156
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:02.660
告诉我实情 普莉亚
So, tell me about it, Priya.


1157
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:05.660
那是独一无二的
It's... It's unique.


1158
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:09.290
打造它的科学家自杀了 这样她就不会被迫打造另一台
The scientist who built it took her own life so she couldn't be forced to make another.


1159
01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:10.380
未来的科学家 
A scientist in the future?


1160
01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.670
好几个世代以后
Generations from now.


1161
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:13.170
她为什么必须自杀 
Why does she have to kill herself?


1162
01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:15.590
你知道曼哈顿计划吗 
You're familiar with the Manhattan Project?


1163
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:20.090
第一次原子弹试爆前 欧本海默开始担心
As they approached the first atomic test,


1164
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:30.270
想像她是那个世代的欧本海默
Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer.


1165
01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:33.190
她发明了逆转世界的方法
She devises a method for inverting the world,


1166
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.570
但是坚信只要毁灭我们 也会毁灭他们自己
but becomes convinced that by destroying us, they're destroying themselves.


1167
01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:39.490
祖父悖论
The grandfather paradox.


1168
01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:42.950
但是和欧本海默不同 她坚决反抗
But, unlike Oppenheimer,


1169
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.660
然后藏在她能想到最好的地方
and hiding them the best place she can think of.


1170
01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:50.420
过去 也就是现今
The past.


1171
01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.880
九个受到史上最严密保护的物质
Nine bombs. Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world.


1172
01:47:57.970 --> 01:48:00.090
最安全的隐藏处
The best hiding place possible.


1173
01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.220
核子安全厂房
Nuclear containment facilities.


1174
01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:07.020
萨托受到未来人资助 终其一生的任务
Sator's lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future, has been to


1175
01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.480
就是找到并组装演算机
find and reassemble the algorithm.


1176
01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.980
他们为何挑中他 
Why do they choose him?


1177
01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.940
因为他刚好出现在对的地方
Because he was at the right place at the right time.


1178
01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:15.190
苏联解体的时候
The collapse of the Soviet Union.


1179
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:18.440
核武史上最不安全的时刻
The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.


1180
01:48:18.610 --> 01:48:20.780
他有几个部分 
How many sections does he have?


1181
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:22.530
拿到钚241后 九个都有
After the 241, all nine.


1182
01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:24.200
老天爷
Jesus Christ.


1183
01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:27.750
所以这次我们要采取不一样的行动
And that's why you're going to do things differently this time.


1184
01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:31.540
改变作法 好让凯萨琳不受伤 
To change things?


1185
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.800
那个宇宙若是存在
If that universe can exist...


1186
01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.590
也没有我们容身之处
we don't live in it.


1187
01:48:39.670 --> 01:48:40.930
总得试试看吧
Well, let's try.


1188
01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:43.340
你会警告我
You're going to warn me.


1189
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:47.060
我不会 无知是我们的优势
No, I'm not. Ignorance is our ammunition.


1190
01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:47.970
拜托
Come on.


1191
01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:50.350
你若知道演算机是什么
If you had known what the algorithm was,


1192
01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.650
还会让它落在萨托手上 
would you have let it fall into Sator's hands?


1193
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.020
你希望萨托拿到最后一部分
You want Sator to get the last section.


1194
01:48:56.110 --> 01:48:58.610
这样他才会带来另外八个
That is the only way he'll bring together the other eight.


1195
01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:00.440
我应该偷走它
I was supposed to steal it...


1196
01:49:01.150 --> 01:49:01.990
然后弄丢它 
then lose it?


1197
01:49:02.150 --> 01:49:03.530
任务达成
Mission accomplished.


1198
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:05.490
你利用我
You used me.


1199
01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:07.870
就像你利用凯萨琳
As you used Katherine.


1200
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:10.450
标准行动程序
Standard operating procedure.


1201
01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.420
你尽了你的职责
You've done your part.


1202
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:14.830
我的职责 
My part?


1203
01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:17.800
我是这项行动的主人翁
I'm the protagonist of this operation.


1204
01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:21.130
你只是其中一个
You... are a protagonist.


1205
01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:24.430
你自以为是拯救世界唯一的救世主 
Did you think you were the only one capable of saving the world?


1206
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:29.890
不是
No.


1207
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:33.980
但我是 因为我还没告诉你
But I am.


1208
01:49:36.230 --> 01:49:37.310
你马上就会告诉我
You're about to.


1209
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:40.070
才不会 那就让我们参一脚
No, I'm not. So, deal us in.


1210
01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.320
我们 
"Us"?


1211
01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.410
为何又要把她拖下水 
Why would you want to involve her again?


1212
01:49:44.490 --> 01:49:45.780
因为她能接近他
Because she can get close to him.


1213
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:47.160
他还信任她吗 
Does he still trust her?


1214
01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.660
他以为她死了 但他曾经信任她
He thinks she's dead.


1215
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:53.710
现在轮到你了
And now, it's your turn.


1216
01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.080
就算你觉得她知道太多 还是得假设她逃过死劫
Assuming she makes it out alive,whether or not you feel she knows too much.


1217
01:49:57.850 --> 01:49:58.590
办不到
I can't.


1218
01:49:58.590 --> 01:49:59.600
如果你没有权力
If you don't have the authority,


1219
01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.670
那就让我和负责处理的人谈谈
then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends.


1220
01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:04.510
我要你承诺
I need your word


1221
01:50:04.590 --> 01:50:07.180
她和她儿子的安全 普莉亚
that she and her son will be safe, Priya.


1222
01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.510
干我们这行承诺有什么用 
What good is someone's word in our line of business?


1223
01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.770
他们会很安全
They'll be safe.


1224
01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:20.650
特隆赫姆外海有个集合点
There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim.


1225
01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:22.280
设法赶到那里
Get yourselves up there.


1226
01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.320
艾佛斯有一个小组准备逆转
Ives has a team ready to invert.


1227
01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.700
你有逆转门 
You have a turnstile?


1228
01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:28.570
和我们试图摧毁的科技一模一样
The exact technology that we're trying to suppress.


1229
01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:30.910
以火攻火很危险
Fighting fire with fire's a treacherous business.


1230
01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:33.580
但是未来有一些人
But there are some people, in the future,


1231
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:36.920
想要继续把演算机送回过去
who want to continue the algorithm's journey into the past.


1232
01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.460
你要知道 天能不是在过去建立
You see... Tenet wasn't founded in the past.


1233
01:50:42.630 --> 01:50:45.300
而是将在未来成立
It will be founded in the future.


1234
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:13.950
还是不习惯鸟倒着飞
Can't get over the birds.


1235
01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.790
还好吧 
How're you feeling?


1236
01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:22.670
告诉我你会杀了他
Tell me you're gonna kill him.


1237
01:51:23.170 --> 01:51:24.260
办不到
I can't.


1238
01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:25.510
为什么 
Why not?


1239
01:51:25.670 --> 01:51:27.510
我打赌你一定杀过很多人
Bet you've probably killed a lot of people.


1240
01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:29.720
他有个失能开关
Not with a dead man's switch.


1241
01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:31.640
就是他戴的智慧手环
The fitness tracker he wears.


1242
01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.310
他一直在监控他的健康
He's obsessive about his health.


1243
01:51:33.390 --> 01:51:34.890
手环连结到一个开关
It'll be linked to a switch,


1244
01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:38.730
大概是一封电邮透露情报点的位置
probably a simple e-mail burst that reveals the location of the dead drop,


1245
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:40.690
他心跳一停止就会起动
set to fire if his heart stops.


1246
01:51:40.770 --> 01:51:42.940
他的死会启动演算机
His death activates the algorithm.


1247
01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:46.530
他死了世界就会毁灭 没人敢杀他
He dies, the world ends. No one dares kill him.


1248
01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:50.820
不对 你想错了
No, you've missed the point.


1249
01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.870
他打算自我了结
He's intending to end his life.


1250
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:57.830
为什么 
Why?


1251
01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:01.040
他就快死了
He's dying.


1252
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.130
无法治愈的胰脏癌
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.


1253
01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.670
他要把全世界当成陪葬品
And he's taking the world with him.


1254
01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.880
他若无法拥有 谁都不能
If he can't have her, no one can.


1255
01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:13.890
他能决定何时何处毁灭世界
He gets to choose the time and place for the end of the world.


1256
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:16.770
他会选择哪个时刻 
What moment? What does he choose?


1257
01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:21.730
你曾说某次度假让他觉得被爱
You told me about a holiday where you let him feel loved.


1258
01:52:21.810 --> 01:52:23.020
越南
Vietnam.


1259
01:52:23.110 --> 01:52:25.020
你说他消失不见 是哪一天 
You said he vanished. What day?


1260
01:52:25.110 --> 01:52:27.900
我和麦斯上岸 他搭机飞走 但不知道是哪一天
I went ashore with Max and he flew off, but I don't know what day it was.


1261
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:31.320
14号 10天前 他人在乌克兰
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.


1262
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:35.660
你怎么知道的 
How do you know about that?


1263
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:39.250
重点是他不在游艇上 那是他的空档
The point is, he wasn't on his yacht, so that's his window.


1264
01:52:39.330 --> 01:52:41.790
回到那个黄金时刻 也是他生命的最后一刻
To go back to that golden moment and have it be his last.


1265
01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:43.420
每个人的最后一刻
Everyone's last.


1266
01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:46.550
我们得神不知鬼不觉 从情报点偷走演算机
We have to lift the algorithm from the dead drop


1267
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:50.470
而且大家不必陪葬
And not the rest of us.


1268
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:51.680
情报点在哪里 
Where's the dead drop?


1269
01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.430
天机不可泄漏 朋友
Knowledge divided, my friend.


1270
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:54.430
你不告诉我 
You're not gonna tell me?


1271
01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:56.260
无知是我们的优势
Ignorance is our ammunition.


1272
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:57.970
但我需要你回到游艇 凯特
But I need you back on that yacht, Kat.


1273
01:52:58.140 --> 01:52:59.180
为什么 
Why?


1274
01:52:59.350 --> 01:53:01.140
你得阻止他自杀
You have to stop him killing himself


1275
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:04.360
直到我们确定演算机不在情报点
until we know the algorithm is out of the dead drop.


1276
01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.610
要是我被逮到 我儿子会目睹一切
But if I'm caught there, my son sees.


1277
01:53:06.690 --> 01:53:10.440
若他时候到了 我不希望他死前看到这一幕
I don't want those moments to be full of anguish if they're gonna be his last.


1278
01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.280
不会的
They're not.


1279
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:38.470
时间到了
It's time.


1280
01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:42.020
我们正在倒退回14号 但不知道情报点在哪里
We're working our way back to the 14th, but without knowing where the dead drop is,


1281
01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.480
我也没办法准备什么
there's only so much I can do to prepare.


1282
01:53:45.650 --> 01:53:47.480
你知道震源是什么吗 
You know what a hypocenter is?


1283
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:51.280
地下核武试爆的原爆点
It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test.


1284
01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:56.410
麦可寇斯比爵士告诉我 史托斯克12市14号有一场核爆
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.


1285
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:58.660
情报点就在震源底下
The dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocenter.


1286
01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:01.790
核爆把演算机封在地底
That explosion seals up the algorithm.


1287
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:05.580
我们最好在核爆前把它挖出来
Well, then we better pull it out of that hole before the bomb goes off, eh?


1288
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.380
排队
Line it up.


1289
01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:10.800
向前走
Move forward.


1290
01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:13.920
下一个
Next.


1291
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:19.510
排队
Line it up.


1292
01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.220
尼尔呢 
Where's Neil?


1293
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:26.690
他一定先过去了
He must've gone through already.


1294
01:54:26.770 --> 01:54:27.860
我没有说再见
I didn't get to say goodbye.


1295
01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.020
这就是再见 不是吗 
This is goodbye, isn't it?


1296
01:54:30.190 --> 01:54:33.190
我很想说 你不必这么做
I'd like to say...that you don't have to do this


1297
01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:36.990
安德烈对我做过最坏的事 就是他向我提出条件
Kat...Worst thing Andrei ever did to me was that offer he made me.


1298
01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:40.160
我不再见儿子 他就放我走
Let me go if I agreed never to see my son again.


1299
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:44.620
我大吼大叫 大飙脏话
I shouted and... swore.


1300
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:48.170
但有一瞬间他从我表情看出
But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant.


1301
01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.090
我在认真考虑
I considered it.


1302
01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:56.090
我不知道是因为我恨透他了
I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done,


1303
01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:58.260
或是因为他看穿了我
or because he knows that about me.


1304
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:59.470
喔
Oh.


1305
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:05.020
有机会救我儿子 你不了解那对一个母亲的意义
A chance to help save my child. You can't know what that means to a mother.


1306
01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:06.020
没错
No.


1307
01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:09.010
你曾经杀过你痛恨的人
You've killed people you've hated before.


1308
01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:09.860
通常不是出于私仇
It's not usually personal.


1309
01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.940
反正他快死了 也许并不算
Well, he's dying anyway. Maybe it doesn't even count.


1310
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:13.650
每杀一个人都算
It always counts, Kat.


1311
01:55:14.110 --> 01:55:16.860
你不是去杀他 而是去阻止他
You're not there to kill him, you're the backstop.


1312
01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:20.280
若我们没偷走演算机 他自杀成功
If we don't lift that algorithm and he kills himself,


1313
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:22.080
就会害死全人类
he takes us all with him.


1314
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:26.830
遵守你的承诺 好吗 
You just keep up your end, okay?


1315
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
今天是14号
Today's the 14th.


1316
01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:35.420
西伯利亚外海 该行动了
Offshore of Siberia.


1317
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:41.390
-谁能让我登上游艇  -我有最佳的人选
give you some time to get back into Vietnam. And who gets me on the yacht?


1318
01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:47.440
你一定会在某时某处受到威胁
There may be a time and place you feel threatened.


1319
01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.230
按下通话键 说出你的位置就挂断
Hit "talk," state your location, hang up.


1320
01:55:50.690 --> 01:55:52.270
谁会听到留言 
Who gets the message?


1321
01:55:52.730 --> 01:55:54.360
后代的人
Posterity.


1322
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:35.110
史托斯克12市
Stalsk-12.


1323
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:38.650
一座隐匿的城市 什么事都有可能发生
Hidden from the world is a city where anything can happen.


1324
01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:41.320
就在今天  各位 10分钟后
And today, ladies and gents, for ten minutes,


1325
01:56:41.410 --> 01:56:43.160
一定会发生一件惊天大事
it most assuredly does.


1326
01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:46.830
你们被分成两队 展开时间钳形攻势
You've been divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement.


1327
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:48.370
我们是红队 顺着时间向前
We're Red Team, moving forward.


1328
01:56:48.450 --> 01:56:50.920
为了容易分辨 你们会配戴这些
In order to distinguish the teams, you'll wear these.


1329
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.790
那边的朋友 由惠勒中校率领的蓝队逆转时间
Our friends over there, Blue Team, led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted.


1330
01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.710
为什么不让我们看到他们 
Why don't they let us see them?


1331
01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.550
也许我们不会喜欢发生的事
Maybe we won't like what happened.


1332
01:56:58.630 --> 01:57:01.510
他们1小时后会听到同样的简报
One hour from now, they had this briefing.


1333
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:06.680
然后会空降在震源上方的山脊
Then, were dropped on the ridge above the hypocenter,


1334
01:57:06.850 --> 01:57:09.100
尽量接近核爆发生的时间
as close in time to the detonation as possible.


1335
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:13.100
他们的任务是清除现场
Their objectives were clearance and clarification.


1336
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:17.020
这次简报有他们在未来的经验
Now, this briefing has the benefit of their experience.


1337
01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.750
两支队伍都有倒数码表
Both teams have countdown watches.


1338
01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:40.010
我们空降后从10倒数 一直到0的核爆发生
Ours counts down from ten, from landing to zero to the explosion.


1339
01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:41.880
-蓝队的时间被逆转 -大伙儿 向左看
- Blue Team is reversed. - Everybody, look to your left.


1340
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:46.050
要是你到0还没到空降区 就别想活着离开
If you are not at the LZ at zero, you are not leaving.


1341
01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:48.430
了解吗 
Do you understand?


1342
01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:52.230
空降后清除现场让蓝队安全撤退
We drop in, clear LZs for Blue Team evacuation.


1343
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:54.020
然后一路挺进市区
We make our way into the city proper.


1344
01:57:54.190 --> 01:57:58.270
这些是废弃建筑物 但我们得知 某处有一道逆转门
These buildings are abandoned, but we learned there is a turnstile.


1345
01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.360
可能会遭到敌人攻击
Expect a bitemporal response.


1346
01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.030
会有逆转时间的弹炮吗 
They'll have inverse ordnance?


1347
01:58:02.110 --> 01:58:04.360
逆转时间的 传统的
Inverse, conventional,


1348
01:58:04.450 --> 01:58:07.490
正常的敌人 逆转的敌人 什么都有
forward antagonists, inverted antagonists, they have it all.


1349
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:11.750
城市另一边的地面隆起 一直到震源上方的山脊
On the other side of the city, the ground rises to the ridge above the hypocenter.


1350
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:17.040
小分队会从市区走这条隧道 一直到震源的地底
A splinter unit will take this tunnel from the city to the floor of the hypocenter.


1351
01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:19.750
蓝队守住这里的入口
Blue Team located an entrance here.


1352
01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:21.960
这块岩石里的炸弹
The bomb is in this rock,


1353
01:58:22.130 --> 01:58:26.180
会在高处引爆造成山崩 封住山洞
high above, to trigger a collapse,


1354
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:30.470
不用 炸弹会按照计划引爆
We don't. The explosion takes place as planned.


1355
01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.480
我们的任务就是拆除炸弹失败
Now, our job is to fail to defuse that bomb


1356
01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:38.110
好让小分队神不知鬼不觉完成任务
while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected.


1357
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:39.110
什么任务 
Which is?


1358
01:58:39.190 --> 01:58:40.480
这是机密 你不必知道
Need-to-know, and you don't.


1359
01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:43.030
还有别的蠢问题吗 
Any other stupid questions?


1360
01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.700
很好 走吧 快去准备
Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready.


1361
01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:50.030
我要参与第一波行动
I wanted to be on the first wave.


1362
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:54.160
没有第一波行动 红队和蓝队同时展开行动
There is no first wave. Red Team and Blue Team operate simultaneously.


1363
01:58:54.250 --> 01:58:58.080
听好 你若拘泥于传统线性时间 就别上直升机
Look, don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear terms.


1364
01:58:58.170 --> 01:59:01.750
你想加入成功得手的队伍吗 
Now, you wanna be on the team that lifts the contents of the capsule?


1365
01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.340
当然想
Absolutely.


1366
01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.380
那就是我们俩
Yeah, that's us.


1367
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:07.470
我们是小分队
We're splinter unit.


1368
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:08.640
只有我们 
Just us?


1369
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:12.520
知道容器里装什么的人 不能离开战场
No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field.


1370
01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:15.680
我们会自己搞定
I thought we'd manage ourselves.


1371
01:59:25.610 --> 01:59:28.530
甲板离水面有40尺 你下得去吗 
It's 40 feet from the private deck to the water.


1372
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:33.200
我发射信号弹前别让他死
Until you see my signal, you don't let him die.


1373
02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:10.530
30秒
Thirty seconds!


1374
02:00:51.610 --> 02:00:52.780
快上 快上
Go! Go! Go!


1375
02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:07.590
我们即将遭遇冲击波 抓紧了
We're coming in on a shockwave. Hang on, people.


1376
02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:18.020
站起来
On your feet!


1377
02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:33.160
那里
There!


1378
02:01:46.170 --> 02:01:48.050
夫人 我们以为您上岸了
Ma'am. We thought you'd gone ashore.


1379
02:01:48.130 --> 02:01:49.800
我偷溜回来给安德烈一个惊喜
Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei.


1380
02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:50.710
老板走了耶
Oh, the boss left.


1381
02:01:52.170 --> 02:01:55.760
请萨托先生来这里找我 别告诉其他人
Well, have Mr. Sator find me here.


1382
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:05.790
地雷
Mines!


1383
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:06.960
地雷
Mines!


1384
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:22.930
他们说你上岸了
They told me you'd gone ashore.


1385
02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.270
他们说你飞走了
They told me you'd flown off.


1386
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:28.480
我回来看你和麦斯
I came back to see you and Max.


1387
02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:30.610
麦斯跟安娜在岸上
Max is on shore with Anna.


1388
02:03:31.770 --> 02:03:33.480
我们吵过架 得好好谈谈
We need time, just you and me, after what happened.


1389
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:36.110
我只是开玩笑 那是个蠢笑话
I was joking. It was a stupid joke.


1390
02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:38.200
你认为我是个坏妈妈
You think I'm a terrible mother.


1391
02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:41.780
我们都知道你比较讨厌我
We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me.


1392
02:03:49.670 --> 02:03:52.000
我希望我们的关系好一点
I want things to be better, Andrei.


1393
02:04:07.690 --> 02:04:08.850
找掩护
Take cover!


1394
02:04:13.230 --> 02:04:15.110
给我AT4反坦克火箭筒
Get me a goddamn AT4!


1395
02:04:15.190 --> 02:04:16.440
马上把他除掉
Take him out, now!


1396
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:18.450
提供掩护
Provide some cover!


1397
02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:20.450
快点 快啊 快上
Move, move, move! Let's go!


1398
02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:21.910
快 快
Move, move, move!


1399
02:05:32.230 --> 02:05:33.060
惠勒
Wheeler!


1400
02:05:34.810 --> 02:05:35.820
快逃
Get outta there!


1401
02:05:35.980 --> 02:05:37.150
来啊
Come on!


1402
02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:43.660
艾佛斯
Ives!


1403
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:47.540
小分队 这里
Splinter unit. Here.


1404
02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:51.580
今天的夕阳会很美
You know, it's going to be a beautiful sunset.


1405
02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:55.540
我会派人带麦斯回来 我们应该跟他有亲子时间
I'll get Max brought back. We should share the moment with him.


1406
02:05:56.170 --> 02:05:58.170
我替你倒杯酒
I'll make you a drink.


1407
02:05:59.130 --> 02:06:01.130
把我儿子带回游艇
Bring my son back to the boat.


1408
02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:08.810
没时间了 快走
We're runnin' out of time, let's go!


1409
02:06:08.890 --> 02:06:11.680
他们看到我们就完了
If they see us, it's all for nothing.


1410
02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:16.310
需要声东击西
We need a distraction.


1411
02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:17.730
安啦
Don't worry about that.


1412
02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:22.820
听我命令
On my mark!


1413
02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.280
用火箭筒炮轰基地
RPG, hit the base!


1414
02:06:28.330 --> 02:06:29.660
炮轰那栋建筑物
That building on my mark!


1415
02:06:31.450 --> 02:06:33.250
3、2
Three! Two!


1416
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:35.170
1 开火
One! Fire!


1417
02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:37.210
开火
Fire!


1418
02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.810
快上
Move! Move!


1419
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:11.540
没退路了 来吧
We're committed now. Come on.


1420
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.420
那是什么 
What's that?


1421
02:07:19.590 --> 02:07:22.050
我向中情局借来的
I borrowed it from the CIA.


1422
02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:24.380
是什么 
What is it?


1423
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:26.800
毁灭世界的方法
The way the world ends.


1424
02:07:26.970 --> 02:07:29.640
不是轰隆巨响 而是悄然一声
Not with a bang, but a whimper.


1425
02:07:29.850 --> 02:07:31.560
我不懂
I don't understand.


1426
02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:33.850
我吞下这个 万物都会消逝
When I take this, it's all over.


1427
02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:36.440
那就先别吞
Then don't take it yet.


1428
02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.110
为什么 
Why not?


1429
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:44.780
因为就快看到夕阳了
Because we have the sunset coming.


1430
02:07:45.110 --> 02:07:47.570
还剩下一点伏特加
And a little vodka left.


1431
02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:49.700
麦斯也很快就回来
And Max will be here soon.


1432
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:53.870
他们说是你在岸上陪麦斯 不是安娜
They said they thought it was you, not Anna, ashore with Max.


1433
02:07:56.660 --> 02:08:00.080
只要你分得出来就好
So long as you can tell the difference.


1434
02:08:02.250 --> 02:08:04.920
我要办正事了 亲爱的
A moment's business, my love.


1435
02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:18.390
米耶 收到吗 
Mahir, do you copy?


1436
02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:21.610
还不行 我重覆 还不行
Not clear. I repeat, not clear!


1437
02:08:21.770 --> 02:08:22.770
收到
Copy that.


1438
02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:26.150
我重覆 还不行
I repeat, not clear!


1439
02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:53.800
尼尔
Neil!


1440
02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:55.680
尼尔
Neil!


1441
02:09:08.530 --> 02:09:09.650
快上
Go!


1442
02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:21.250
炸弹威力不够把门炸开
We don't have anything big enough to blow this.


1443
02:09:27.590 --> 02:09:29.340
搜他身 看有没有手榴弹
Try him. See if he's got a grenade.


1444
02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:35.010
有吗 
Anything?


1445
02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:36.140
没有
Nah, nothing.


1446
02:09:37.250 --> 02:09:39.620
过来看看 能不能撬开锁 
Here, you try having a look. Can you pick it?


1447
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:42.230
希望不能 那锁花了我很多钱
I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock.


1448
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:45.270
喜欢我旅程的开始 还有你旅程的结束吗 
How do you like where my journey began and yours ends?


1449
02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:46.860
核弹的辐射太强了
Little radioactive for my taste.


1450
02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:49.940
我的宿命和核弹息息相关
My fate was always bound up with radiation.


1451
02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:53.530
我们在最危险的地方干活
We'd work where no one else would.


1452
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:56.410
我和魔鬼做了交易
I made a bargain with the devil.


1453
02:09:56.490 --> 02:09:58.080
金钱交换时间
Money for time.


1454
02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:00.330
我们出卖我们的未来
We sold our futures.


1455
02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:03.580
现在你要犯下足以毁灭世界的错误
And now you're about to make the same mistake for the entire world.


1456
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:06.670
那不是错误 而是我交换的条件
It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I could.


1457
02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:08.050
你的回报是什么 
What was yours?


1458
02:10:08.130 --> 02:10:10.840
你为了不解的使命而奋战
You fight for a cause you barely understand...


1459
02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:14.970
与你不信任的人合作 什么都没告诉他们
with people you trust so little, you've told them nothing.


1460
02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.220
我死了 世界也跟着我毁灭
When I die, the world dies with me.


1461
02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:19.390
你的知识也随着你消逝
And your knowledge dies with you,


1462
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:23.140
一起被埋进坟里 就像一个无名的古埃及建筑工人
buried in a tomb like an anonymous Egyptian builder


1463
02:10:23.230 --> 02:10:25.770
被封在金字塔里以守住秘密
sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret.


1464
02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:28.440
你的信仰是盲目的 你是个疯子
Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic.


1465
02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.460
有什么比毁灭世界更疯狂 
What's more fanatical than trying to destroy the world?


1466
02:10:51.550 --> 02:10:54.090
并不是 我在创造一个新世界
I'm not, I'm creating a new one.


1467
02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:58.470
某时某处 一个人在水晶塔中打开开关
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch


1468
02:10:59.050 --> 02:11:02.640
就同时触发并避免了世界末日
and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.


1469
02:11:02.810 --> 02:11:06.190
现在时间自己逆转方向
Now time itself switches direction.


1470
02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:08.690
我们沐浴在其中的阳光
The same sunshine we basked in


1471
02:11:08.770 --> 02:11:12.650
将温暖我们在未来世代的后裔
will warm the faces of our descendants generations to come.


1472
02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:14.740
他们为何要杀死我们 
How could they wanna kill us?


1473
02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:18.160
因为他们的海水上涨 河流干枯
Because their oceans rose and their rivers ran dry.


1474
02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:21.830
你不明白吗  他们别无选择才会逆转时间
Don't you see? They have no choice but to turn back.


1475
02:11:22.450 --> 02:11:24.410
都是我们的错
We're responsible.


1476
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:40.680
你知道了事实 还会阻止我吗 
Knowing this, do you still want me to stop?


1477
02:11:41.810 --> 02:11:45.600
会 每个世代都努力设法存活
Yes. Each generation looks out for its own survival.


1478
02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:47.600
这就是他们在做的
That's exactly what they're doing.


1479
02:11:47.690 --> 02:11:49.810
但你不是 你是个叛徒
But not you. You're a traitor.


1480
02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:52.980
你没有自己的人生才想害死所有人
Bringing death to all, because you have no life


1481
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:56.610
你儿子的生命不会
Not your son's.


1482
02:11:56.700 --> 02:12:00.410
我最大的罪过就是把儿子 带进我明知会灭亡的世界
My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending.


1483
02:12:00.490 --> 02:12:02.410
你觉得上帝会宽恕我吗 
You think God will forgive me?


1484
02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:09.330
等等
Wait!


1485
02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:11.380
等等
Wait!


1486
02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.800
可恶
God...


1487
02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:26.640
掩护我
Cover me!


1488
02:12:34.530 --> 02:12:36.360
快上 快上
Go! Go! Go!


1489
02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:42.910
你不相信上帝或未来 或是在你经验之外的事
You don't believe in God, or a future, or anything outside of your own experience.


1490
02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.620
其它的才是信仰
The rest is belief.


1491
02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:48.000
而我没有信念
And I don't have it.


1492
02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:52.170
没有信念就不是人类 你只是个疯子
Without it, you're not human. You're just a madman.


1493
02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:55.800
或是一个神之类的
Or a god.


1494
02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:01.760
住手 天啊
Don't. Jesus.


1495
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.760
我们的时间到了
Our time is up.


1496
02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:12.440
我会替你问候我老婆
I'll give your love to my wife.


1497
02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:15.110
你忘了 我还不认识她
You're forgetting. I haven't met her yet.


1498
02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:18.110
没错 你认识她以后她就死了
That's right. After you meet her, she dies.


1499
02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:20.740
那我就把我的爱给她
I'll just give her my love instead.


1500
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:23.070
别这么做
Don't do...


1501
02:13:24.490 --> 02:13:25.330
瓦克夫
Volkov...


1502
02:13:25.730 --> 02:13:27.390
射爆他的头

1503
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:41.470
别谈公事了 亲爱的
Enough business, my love.


1504
02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:11.460
你根本不知道我在说什么 对吧 
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?


1505
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:15.920
不过听起来很重要
But it sounds terribly important.


1506
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.260
你要去哪 
Where are you going?


1507
02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:20.670
你不热吗 
Aren't you hot?


1508
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:38.520
你在干嘛 
What are you doing now?


1509
02:14:38.690 --> 02:14:40.360
防晒油挤得满地
I spilled sunscreen.


1510
02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:42.650
-又怎样  -甲板很滑
- So what? - Slippery!


1511
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:47.410
过来吧
Just come here.


1512
02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:53.410
转过去 你会喜欢的
Turn over. You'll like it.


1513
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:29.330
我做不到
I can't do this.


1514
02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.000
-我不能让你以为你赢了 -别破坏这一刻 凯特
- I can't let you think you've won. - Don't spoil this moment, Kat.


1515
02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:35.920
我不会让你进了坟墓 还以为会带我们一起陪葬
I'm not letting you go to your grave thinking we're coming with you.


1516
02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:39.790
你会孤独死去 安德烈
You're dying alone, Andrei.


1517
02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.000
快点 快点
Come on, come on, come on!


1518
02:15:41.170 --> 02:15:43.510
隧道封死 闸门关闭
Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed.


1519
02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:45.510
米耶 收到吗 
Mahir, do you copy?


1520
02:15:45.970 --> 02:15:46.800
收到
Yeah.


1521
02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:48.800
先别行动 我重覆 别行动
Hold. I repeat, hold!


1522
02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:55.390
看着我的双眼
Look in my eyes.


1523
02:15:56.730 --> 02:15:58.190
你看到什么 
Which do you see?


1524
02:15:59.270 --> 02:16:02.190
绝望或愤怒 
Despair or anger?


1525
02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:07.780
我不是能给你爱的女人 虽然你伤了她的心
I'm not the woman who could find love for you even though you scarred her on the inside.


1526
02:16:09.570 --> 02:16:13.410
我是被你射伤 存心要报复的悍妇
I'm the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside.


1527
02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:17.620
不
No!


1528
02:16:36.850 --> 02:16:37.690
惨了
Shit.


1529
02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:41.670
艾佛斯 她杀了他 收到吗  她杀死了他
Ives, she's killed him. Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.


1530
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:44.020
她太早行动 杀死了他
She jumped the gun. She killed him.


1531
02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:05.000
快啊 他们到那里了吗 
Come on, come on! Do you think they made it?


1532
02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:10.590
管它的
Ah, screw it.


1533
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:23.960
凯特 你太早行动了
Kat! You jumped the gun!


1534
02:18:24.130 --> 02:18:28.090
我办不到 我不能让他觉得自己赢了才死
I couldn't do it. I couldn't let him die thinking he'd won.


1535
02:18:28.170 --> 02:18:30.260
我知道你会有办法
I knew you'd find a way.


1536
02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.930
等等 你有办法 我们不会死吧 
Wait, you found a way, we're okay, right?


1537
02:18:33.010 --> 02:18:35.140
对 我有办法 保重
Yeah, found a way. Be safe.


1538
02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:58.240
我还以为你是逆转的
Thought you were inverted.


1539
02:18:58.450 --> 02:19:00.160
我在中间换了时间
Changed gears halfway.


1540
02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:03.460
看来你们这里需要帮忙
Looked like you needed help here.


1541
02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:05.880
这里 在下面时才需要帮忙
Here? We needed help down there.


1542
02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:08.420
你怎么把锁打开 
How'd you get that lock open?


1543
02:19:09.250 --> 02:19:11.510
不是我 你的小队不是需要你 
Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you?


1544
02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:14.260
下一次回去时再去带他们
I'll get 'em on the next pass.


1545
02:19:14.930 --> 02:19:15.930
好吗 艾佛斯 
All right, Ives?


1546
02:19:16.470 --> 02:19:18.180
先等我喘口气
Once I've caught my breath.


1547
02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:35.320
看到这玩意的人都不能活着离开
No one who's seen this leaves the field.


1548
02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:45.120
好吧
All right.


1549
02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:50.170
我们把它藏起来
We hide it.


1550
02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.380
然后再自我了断
We end our lives.


1551
02:19:53.170 --> 02:19:55.380
这是唯一确定的方法
That's the only way to be sure.


1552
02:19:57.130 --> 02:19:59.010
至于何时自杀
As to when...


1553
02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:01.810
也许就让每个人自己决定
maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself.


1554
02:20:02.930 --> 02:20:04.230
你不杀我们 
You're not gonna kill us?


1555
02:20:04.390 --> 02:20:06.770
我找到你们就会
If I ever find you, I will.


1556
02:20:06.850 --> 02:20:08.560
但你不会努力找吧 
But you won't look too hard?


1557
02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:10.610
当然会
Yes, I will.


1558
02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:16.400
你不会回伦敦找凯特吧 
You're not going back to London to check on Kat, are you?


1559
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:19.030
不会 太危险了
No. It's far too dangerous.


1560
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:21.620
远远看她也不会 
Even from afar?


1561
02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:24.120
不会
Even from afar.


1562
02:20:26.410 --> 02:20:27.580
艾佛斯
Ives!


1563
02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:29.830
等等
Wait.


1564
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:37.760
你真的要再回去 
Are you really going back in?


1565
02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:43.600
只有我能及时把门打开 对吧 
I'm the only one who could've got that door open in time, right, Ives?


1566
02:20:43.810 --> 02:20:46.270
你是最高竿的锁匠
Well, I don't know any locksmiths as good as you.


1567
02:20:47.730 --> 02:20:48.810
听到吗 
See?


1568
02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.400
又是我在里面
It's me in there, again.


1569
02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:54.940
为了这项任务创造另一个过去
Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission.


1570
02:21:03.490 --> 02:21:04.450
尼尔 等等
Neil, wait!


1571
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:10.710
我们才刚拯救世界
Just saved the world.


1572
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.920
不能留下任何风险
Can't leave anything to chance.


1573
02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:16.010
但我们做法不同会改变什么吗 
But can we change things if we do it differently?


1574
02:21:16.420 --> 02:21:18.630
发生过的已经发生了
"What's happened's happened."


1575
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:21.800
这是对这个世界运作的信念
Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world.


1576
02:21:22.390 --> 02:21:24.180
而不是袖手旁观的藉口
It's not an excuse to do nothing.


1577
02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:25.430
宿命 
Fate?


1578
02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:26.930
随你怎么说
Call it what you want.


1579
02:21:27.310 --> 02:21:28.520
你会怎么说 
What do you call it?


1580
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:30.390
现实
Reality.


1581
02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:34.360
让我走吧
Now let me go.


1582
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:42.620
你一直没说是谁找你来的 尼尔
Hey, you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil.


1583
02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:44.740
你到现在还没猜到 
Haven't you guessed by now?


1584
02:21:45.450 --> 02:21:46.410
是你啊
You did.


1585
02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:49.540
只是跟你原来想的不一样
Only not when you thought.


1586
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:52.210
你在过去有个未来
You have a future in the past.


1587
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:55.340
对我来说是多年前 对你来说是多年后
Years ago for me. Years from now for you.


1588
02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:58.010
你认识我很多年了 
You've known me for years?


1589
02:21:59.670 --> 02:22:03.470
对我来说 这是一段美好友情的结束
For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship.


1590
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:05.640
但对我来说 这只是开始
But for me, it's just the beginning.


1591
02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:08.060
我们一起干了一些事
We get up to some stuff.


1592
02:22:08.470 --> 02:22:10.940
你一定会喜欢 等着瞧
You're gonna love it. You'll see.


1593
02:22:11.810 --> 02:22:14.270
整项任务都是时间钳形攻势
This whole operation's a temporal pincer.


1594
02:22:14.650 --> 02:22:15.900
谁的任务 
Whose?


1595
02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:18.900
你的
Yours!


1596
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:20.570
你才完成一半
You're only halfway there.


1597
02:22:20.650 --> 02:22:22.610
我会在一开始见你 朋友
I'll see you at the beginning, friend.


1598
02:22:31.410 --> 02:22:34.580
我们拯救了可能走向灭亡的世界
We're the people saving the world from what might have been.


1599
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:36.460
世人将永远不知道这件事
World will never know what could've happened.


1600
02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:41.300
就算知道也不会在乎
And even if they did, they wouldn't care.


1601
02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.890
因为没人在乎没引爆的炸弹
'Cause no one cares about the bomb that didn't go off.


1602
02:22:47.970 --> 02:22:48.890
坎农街3号

1603
02:22:48.970 --> 02:22:50.930
只有拯救世界的人才知道
Only the one that did.


1604
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:54.690
在孩子出来前动手
Do it before the boy comes out.


1605
02:22:57.310 --> 02:23:00.360
这算是慈悲 你答应过我
That's your idea of mercy? You gave me your word.


1606
02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:03.570
我当时也告诉你要付出代价
And I told you then what it would be worth.


1607
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:05.950
这里 就在今天
Here, today.


1608
02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:08.830
你怎么知道 
How did you know?


1609
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:13.540
坎农街 下午3点 大概没什么
Cannon Place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm...


1610
02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:14.870
后代
Posterity.


1611
02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:18.540
坎农街 下午3点 大概没什么
Cannon Place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm...

02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:22.510
我跟你说过 你得开始以不同角度看这世界

02:23:23.170 --> 02:23:26.140
-我必须清理善后 -那从来都不是你的责任
- I have to tie up the loose ends. - That was never your job.

02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:27.180
那是谁的

我的

没人知道的危机确实存在

1622
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:59.710
那枚炸弹拥有真正改变世界的力量
