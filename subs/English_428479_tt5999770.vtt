00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.474
INSPIRED IN TRUE-LIFE EVENTS
Some scenes, characters, names...


2
00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:51.374
...or events were changed
for dramatic purposes.


3
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:00.481
Get out, get out.

4
00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:03.316
Out.

5
00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:06.881
Hey you, wake up! Get out!

6
00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:10.290
Come on!

7
00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:17.487
Good morning.

8
00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:18.924
Good morning.
What do we have here?


9
00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:20.829
They were just apprehended.

10
00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:22.831
- Name?
- Carlos Ramirez.


11
00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:25.935
- Name?
- Julian.


12
00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.503
- Full name.
- Julian Sosa.


13
00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:31.002
- Name?
- Emanuel Hernandez.


14
00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:33.841
- Name?
- Rufino Mejia.


15
00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:36.446
Come with me.

16
00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:42.955
- Fever?
- No.


17
00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.556
- Cough?
- No.


18
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:46.626
- Diarrhea?
- No.


19
00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:48.625
Please, open your mouth.

20
00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:55.297
Stick out your tongue.

21
00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:00.635
Bring in the other one, please.

22
00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.671
- Are you gonna hit me?
- Are you daring me? Put the shirt on like I said!


23
00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:06.137
Don't you dare me!

24
00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.144
You don't want me to
put it on for you!

25
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.142
Don't wear it then
'cause I'll nail it on you if you don't...


26
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:12.411
All right, you are the boss...

27
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.580
- Oh, were you ever doubting me?
- No.


28
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.421
Enough! Take him away!
And bring in the other one.


29
00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:23.987
You... Come in here.

30
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.492
Take everything off.

31
00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:35.604
Check that.
Take off that chain.


32
00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:44.348
This will stay here until one
of your relatives comes here to claim it.


33
00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:45.952
Take off your pants.

34
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.356
Move it pretty boy, move it!

35
00:03:57.887 --> 00:03:58.865
Turn around.

36
00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.136
Bend over!

37
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.038
I said, bend over!

38
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.073
Spread your cheeks.
Wider!


39
00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.314
Stand up!

40
00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:16.917
Turn around.

41
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.988
That looks interesting...

42
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:23.490
Hey!

43
00:04:23.613 --> 00:04:25.183
Hands down
when you're talking to me!


44
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.520
We're chopping that right away...

45
00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:29.596
These are your clothes from now on.

46
00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:33.099
Move it!

47
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:36.330
Put this one in block six.

48
00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:39.498
Hold on, hold on, what's the hurry?
Get going...


49
00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:41.636
Count yourself lucky for now.

50
00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.333
All the way to the back.

51
00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:45.934
Hey fish, what's up?

52
00:05:57.206 --> 00:05:58.913
What are you looking at?

53
00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:08.291
Hello, fresh meat.

54
00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:10.592
C'mon fish, move that ass.

55
00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:14.931
Keep going,
you ain't got nothing here.


56
00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.569
How about some Vaseline
for this gump here.


57
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.909
Keep walking!

58
00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:26.406
Fishes to the back!

59
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.208
What the hell...!

60
00:06:28.438 --> 00:06:29.974
Time to pay your bill!

61
00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:31.084
Fuck!

62
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:32.581
Check him!

63
00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:34.250
Shut your mouth, you gump!

64
00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:35.584
- Fuck!
- Go, go!


65
00:06:47.023 --> 00:06:48.832
Dude, don't try
to fight them back...


66
00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:51.005
A fish like you gotta pay your dues...

67
00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:54.332
What's with you pretty boy?

68
00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.867
Don't you like the resort?

69
00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:04.845
Don't get upset with me, boss...

70
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:09.115
I happen to be the only one who can
pull strings for you here.


71
00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:11.391
I don't need any of your help.

72
00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:14.226
Then you'll sleep on the bare floor
like a frog...


73
00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:18.566
Or I can talk to Vlady
and bargain a bed for you.


74
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.798
What do you say?

75
00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:28.075
Everyone here calls me "Bolo".

76
00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:31.308
I hustle the refreshments
and get people connected.


77
00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:33.404
Let me introduce you to Vlady.

78
00:07:35.338 --> 00:07:36.578
Vlady!

79
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.078
- Vlady!
- Wait a second.


80
00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:41.482
- Cover for me.
- Come here, fatso.


81
00:07:43.613 --> 00:07:46.924
- What's up, dude?
- This fish here needs a place to crash.


82
00:07:47.517 --> 00:07:51.932
We don't have a lot of space
but we can find him something.


83
00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.426
- Got any cash?
- Yeah.


84
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.172
Then look for me later tonight,
I can't help you now.


85
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:00.270
I'm gonna get back to my game.

86
00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:01.942
- Will do.
- We'll talk.


87
00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:04.340
Come, I'll give you a tour.

88
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:07.508
My bro, we have a few options here.

89
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.784
Right now we're at the old complex,
but they also have the new one.


90
00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:16.287
Over there you get
a nice bed, clean toilet,

91
00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:18.789
lots of security...

92
00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:22.953
But here at the old complex we have
plenty of liberties they don't.


93
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.064
I see.

94
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:27.233
The tradeoff is that
it's a stink hole here.

95
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:31.800
And you should thank God you didn't end up
in "La Victoria" or "Quince de Azua".


96
00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.236
That's hell on earth.

97
00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.078
Let's go over here.

98
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:38.912
Thanks.

99
00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:40.306
Give him fifty.

100
00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.415
Fifty bro! Come on...
We're both in the same boat!


101
00:08:46.843 --> 00:08:48.083
We'll talk later.

102
00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.996
Hey, I don't want to catch you
flirting with my broad, you hear me?


103
00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:00.497
Come on, you know I'm not a traitor.

104
00:09:00.857 --> 00:09:01.835
Yeah...

105
00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:05.938
Dinner time!

106
00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:18.547
This way and don't step
on the "frogs" or they'll punch you.


107
00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:23.216
Watch your step.

108
00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:32.232
Over here.

109
00:09:33.923 --> 00:09:34.901
Here.

110
00:09:35.258 --> 00:09:37.795
For the money you paid
this is all I can do.


111
00:09:38.094 --> 00:09:40.233
Look what you're getting.

112
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.608
Look...

113
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:45.403
You're still a "frog"
but you get more privileges.


114
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:48.072
You're not sleeping on the bare floor;
you have a mat and will be by yourself.


115
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:51.252
If you want better accommodations
you'll have to pony up more dough


116
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.976
...because that's all
I can get you for that.


117
00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.416
I can help you this far.

118
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.415
Come on, give me that.
Now just go to sleep.


119
00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.417
Get in there.

120
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:05.166
Don't hit your head.
We don't have any medics here.


121
00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:08.462
And watch your shoes. This ain't no convent.
I ain't responsible tor them.


122
00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:26.176
Here, take the soap.
Wash your face.


123
00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:56.549
Hit the road, buddy...

124
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.479
What's up, bro?

125
00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:04.390
The duck is sticking his head out.

126
00:11:06.682 --> 00:11:09.128
He's wearing a nice chain.
It could be worth a a good chunk.


127
00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:12.996
They had keys to a vehicle.
Seems they're on premium wheels.


128
00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:18.600
Copy that! Get that stuff
and call me back.


129
00:11:21.864 --> 00:11:23.172
What is up with you fish?

130
00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:24.843
Easy, bro.

131
00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:26.644
You didn't hear anything, did you?

132
00:11:26.969 --> 00:11:28.505
- I heard nothing.
- Yeah.


133
00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:32.353
- So what's the drill?
- What drill?


134
00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:36.023
I have people outside
who can shake things down like no others.


135
00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.859
Oh yeah? So how many
of them are there?


136
00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:40.026
Two.

137
00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:41.286
What's their ride?

138
00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:42.519
Motorcycles.

139
00:11:43.152 --> 00:11:45.632
I'll be around then.
If anything hit me up.


140
00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:46.866
Copy that.

141
00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:49.036
Well, now you know.
Get busy.


142
00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:00.871
Let's see if you're up
for more mayhem again!


143
00:12:05.007 --> 00:12:06.042
Your hands...

144
00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:09.484
Let's see it there are any fractures.
Squeeze my hand?


145
00:12:11.847 --> 00:12:13.326
Okay, no fractures.

146
00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:16.428
Squeeze again.

147
00:12:18.454 --> 00:12:19.592
No fractures.

148
00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:22.494
Take the analgesics I prescribed.

149
00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:25.597
Everything will be perfect
in a couple hours.


150
00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:37.518
Two thousand.
I couldn't get more.


151
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:41.280
It's fine, I'll manage
with this for now.


152
00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:45.114
- Is it hard here?
- Very much. What did you find out?


153
00:12:48.317 --> 00:12:51.025
They told me they'll
give you 3 to 4 years...


154
00:12:51.387 --> 00:12:53.298
...but you'll have
to wait for a conviction.


155
00:12:53.489 --> 00:12:54.866
How much time did you get?

156
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:57.132
Three months for starters.

157
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.140
That's what happened to Rafa
from the hood.


158
00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:02.067
They gave him 5 years!

159
00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:06.138
I'm tired of telling you both to quit.

160
00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:09.975
I'd rather be here than
making a living piling bricks like you.


161
00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:12.319
I have a respectable job!

162
00:13:12.842 --> 00:13:15.482
Cool, so bring me some
of that respectable money.


163
00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:19.258
I don't have a choice.
You brought this upon yourself.


164
00:13:21.951 --> 00:13:22.986
Leave.

165
00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:28.426
Hey, you don't look that bad.

166
00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:37.936
Babe, you've left me high and dry.

167
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.941
You stood me up last Sunday.

168
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.179
What are you saying?
Are you coming this Sunday?


169
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.950
Wait, someone's calling me...
Wait, bro!


170
00:13:47.977 --> 00:13:49.513
We'll talk tonight.

171
00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:17.249
You got to stand guard.
Don't fucking let anybody through.


172
00:14:18.007 --> 00:14:19.577
You can't let anyone through.

173
00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:21.580
I'm sorry, boss.
I won't let anyone through.


174
00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.584
I'll do as you say.
You know better.


175
00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:27.255
You don't know
how stuff is done here.


176
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.430
Yeah, I'll do whatever you say, sir.

177
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:50.851
She seems to be asking about you.

178
00:14:51.373 --> 00:14:53.284
- Which one?
- That one.


179
00:14:57.379 --> 00:14:58.858
She looks good, right?

180
00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:00.288
I can't really see her from here.

181
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:02.028
That one.

182
00:15:02.218 --> 00:15:03.629
The one standing
next to the post.


183
00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:05.124
I see.

184
00:15:05.387 --> 00:15:06.365
Fuck!

185
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.660
Where is it?

186
00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:15.508
The boy's talking to her.

187
00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:18.036
But she overdid it.

188
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.149
Get down, gump!

189
00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:25.483
- What's wrong?
- Get down!


190
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:27.147
What's wrong with you?!

191
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.258
- So you think you're smartass?
- What do you mean, bro?


192
00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:38.022
You're talking to my broad,
cocksucker.


193
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.499
No, I'm talking to my girl.
I don't play like that, bro.


194
00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:45.001
Damnit!
Who the fuck stole my phone?!


195
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.003
- I ain't no wolf, dude!
- Get down!


196
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.172
Come on, bro, take it easy or else!

197
00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:53.943
You're crossing a line here
and I ain't liking it a bit!


198
00:15:54.136 --> 00:15:55.945
Tell me what's your scheme!

199
00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.352
Tell me or I'll give you a C-section!

200
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:00.348
- Easy, easy!
- Calm down!


201
00:16:01.143 --> 00:16:03.623
Get away!
Nobody gets close to me!


202
00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:05.287
You're fucked, cocksucker!

203
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.231
Get the fuck away!
My problem is with him!


204
00:16:15.925 --> 00:16:17.905
Get away or I'll slice you!

205
00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:21.565
Come here and dare me!

206
00:16:24.433 --> 00:16:25.411
Don't touch me!

207
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:30.978
Don't you touch me!

208
00:16:35.945 --> 00:16:37.925
Get away, I said!

209
00:16:39.481 --> 00:16:40.459
Move!

210
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.428
Get way!

211
00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:46.199
Stop it! Put that down!

212
00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:49.102
- Quiet now!
- I'm down.


213
00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:51.097
Turn around.

214
00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:52.939
Quiet!

215
00:16:53.028 --> 00:16:55.201
I said quiet or I'll cut you
with your own knife!


216
00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:57.840
I said, quiet.

217
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.450
So you two are fighting
over women, huh?


218
00:17:08.644 --> 00:17:10.783
You're both headed
for the new complex.


219
00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:13.384
Come on now, boss, let's talk.

220
00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:16.290
We'll do time in the hole
and we'll make amends.


221
00:17:16.418 --> 00:17:17.453
Please, don't be like that.

222
00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:19.566
Yeah right!
You want to go to the hole...


223
00:17:19.822 --> 00:17:21.995
...and then come back here to do
as you please. Bullshit!


224
00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:23.434
You're both going
to the new complex.


225
00:17:23.492 --> 00:17:26.063
Bring me the plate and put it there,
half and half.


226
00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:27.807
Party is over.

227
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.238
Move it.
To the new complex. Move.


228
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.242
- Let's talk!
- Yeah, we'll talk over there.


229
00:17:43.946 --> 00:17:45.254
I can't believe it.

230
00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:47.427
Damn it. They got serious this time.

231
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.591
We'll have to find
another place to "peckertalk".


232
00:17:49.852 --> 00:17:51.832
or ask my man to sign up
for college...


233
00:17:51.954 --> 00:17:53.490
So we can take some class together.

234
00:17:58.627 --> 00:18:00.334
Manaury would never take a class...

235
00:18:00.462 --> 00:18:02.442
It's all your fault for pecker-talking
with another man.


236
00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.477
- What do you mean, jackass?
- You know what I mean.


237
00:18:04.633 --> 00:18:06.840
What the hell do you know!
The pot calling the kettle black!


238
00:18:06.969 --> 00:18:09.040
Yeah but they didn't catch me
'cause I know how to do things well!


239
00:18:09.138 --> 00:18:11.414
Look you asswipe, this is the first time
I've seen that guy.


240
00:18:11.473 --> 00:18:14.283
- And that's none of your business.
- Shut up, you damn whore!


241
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.051
Damn whore? As if you don't take pleasure
fooling with my man.


242
00:18:18.147 --> 00:18:20.286
- That man ain't yours anymore.
- You fucking bitch!


243
00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:25.389
Do you know who I am?

244
00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:28.567
Bitch! Come and get me!

245
00:18:28.991 --> 00:18:30.402
Find out who I am!

246
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:34.200
Next time you won't have
anybody to save you!


247
00:18:34.496 --> 00:18:38.137
I'm going to pull your goddamn teeth out
with my bare hands!


248
00:18:38.434 --> 00:18:40.141
Easy now... Easy.

249
00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:42.309
Leave me the fuck alone!

250
00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:45.149
Get off of me,
here comes the guard.


251
00:18:46.842 --> 00:18:48.412
Guards incoming, hold on.

252
00:18:52.848 --> 00:18:54.418
So what do you think?

253
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.491
This was Manaury's bed. What a relief
that they finally took him away.


254
00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:01.395
Do you have anything more for me
to put you in there?


255
00:19:02.858 --> 00:19:04.166
Mmmm damn...

256
00:19:05.294 --> 00:19:06.272
Shit man.

257
00:19:06.462 --> 00:19:09.375
Oh well, it is what it is...
You're the boss now.


258
00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:12.776
A beach resort is shit compared to this.

259
00:19:13.302 --> 00:19:14.940
- Thanks, Vlady.
- You're welcome.


260
00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.281
You can't get a better view.

261
00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:27.926
Hey, man. The engine didn't start
so we had to leave it back.


262
00:19:28.117 --> 00:19:29.357
We almost got caught.

263
00:19:29.485 --> 00:19:32.557
Didn't I tell you to keep the engine on,
or else it'd shut down?


264
00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:34.434
Yeah, my bad.

265
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.568
So what then?

266
00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:38.198
We'll try to get another
motorcycle.


267
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.569
I'll call you later.

268
00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:42.234
Fuck...

269
00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:00.984
Hey there!
This is yours, right?


270
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.051
I don't want any trouble.

271
00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:06.487
It's cool.

272
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.837
You know how it is.

273
00:21:20.629 --> 00:21:21.835
So?

274
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.601
Let's get acquainted with the upcoming event.

275
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.608
- Are we singing?
- We're singing.


276
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.111
- You can sing solo.
- What?


277
00:21:30.472 --> 00:21:32.179
- You can sing solo.
- Oh, no.


278
00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.354
She was the last one.

279
00:21:34.643 --> 00:21:36.179
Maybe you?

280
00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.957
- Why not you?
- Because I have a sore throat.


281
00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:41.188
Ok, you start, 
I'll follow you.

282
00:21:41.483 --> 00:21:42.962
- Me?
- Yes. Go ahead.


283
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:44.459
Let's see how it sounds.

284
00:21:44.653 --> 00:21:45.631
Alright.

285
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:54.966
Keep singing.

286
00:22:02.004 --> 00:22:04.985
- Sing it higher.
- I can't do it. You do it.


287
00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:14.486
The audience is going to lynch us
if we keep singing like this!


288
00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:15.924
This bad.

289
00:22:16.184 --> 00:22:17.492
I told you I can't sing.

290
00:22:17.619 --> 00:22:19.496
Come on, you can do it.

291
00:22:32.367 --> 00:22:35.439
Fausto, sneak this in his food
for the guy over there.


292
00:22:35.871 --> 00:22:37.179
Yeah, sure.

293
00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:02.466
Move your asses, "pokemons".

294
00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:11.142
- Like your new place?
- Can't complain.


295
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:14.321
- Did you try the beans?
- Why?


296
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.316
Stick your spoon in.

297
00:23:18.947 --> 00:23:20.585
Don't poke it, you dumbass.

298
00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:22.828
What's this?

299
00:23:23.118 --> 00:23:25.098
That's my business, buddy.

300
00:23:27.456 --> 00:23:29.163
Don't make a fuss.

301
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.100
That is for you,
courtesy of the house.


302
00:23:32.361 --> 00:23:34.272
- Don't you snort?
- No.


303
00:23:35.297 --> 00:23:37.937
That's okay, we'll get you
some clean beans.


304
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.608
What do you want, man?

305
00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:42.278
Someone to look after you,
to guard your back


306
00:23:42.371 --> 00:23:43.509
Simple as that.

307
00:23:44.973 --> 00:23:46.611
Calm down, just relax!

308
00:23:47.209 --> 00:23:49.280
As long as you play along,
we're cool.


309
00:23:49.478 --> 00:23:51.458
If I say "pokemon, attack",
you attack.


310
00:23:51.646 --> 00:23:53.284
Simple as that.
You get it now?


311
00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:55.293
What the hell
do you want me to do?


312
00:23:56.385 --> 00:23:59.457
I just want you to send
a message to my broad.


313
00:23:59.988 --> 00:24:01.968
I don't know how to
communicate with them.


314
00:24:02.224 --> 00:24:04.636
Relax, just finish your meal and
I'll show you how.


315
00:24:06.061 --> 00:24:08.132
- Is it cool?
- Cool.


316
00:24:10.999 --> 00:24:12.569
Can you get me some weed?

317
00:24:13.168 --> 00:24:15.148
You just love flying high, don't you?

318
00:24:15.837 --> 00:24:17.578
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.


319
00:24:19.608 --> 00:24:22.589
It's harder now but this way
I can keep an eye on you.


320
00:24:23.845 --> 00:24:25.256
And... what...

321
00:24:25.447 --> 00:24:27.154
What if people find out about...?

322
00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:29.090
No, we always change the signals.

323
00:24:29.351 --> 00:24:32.093
Everything will be fine so long
you don't make a fuss about it.


324
00:24:33.455 --> 00:24:35.833
Look over there,
see that guy climbing up?


325
00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:39.096
Every "woodpecker" has their
own signals with his girl.


326
00:24:39.294 --> 00:24:42.104
My signal for her is...
Look at me!


327
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:43.601
"Hey".

328
00:24:44.132 --> 00:24:45.941
- She should answer back the same...
- Again?


329
00:24:46.134 --> 00:24:47.943
She will answer back the same way.

330
00:24:48.303 --> 00:24:50.010
- "Hey". Like this.
- Like this?


331
00:24:50.539 --> 00:24:52.109
Show some character, dumbass!

332
00:24:52.307 --> 00:24:53.285
Like this.

333
00:24:53.475 --> 00:24:55.955
When she signals back,
you're going to tell her...


334
00:24:56.478 --> 00:24:59.186
"Your man..."
Do it with me.


335
00:25:02.551 --> 00:25:04.258
Change that attitude. Come on!

336
00:25:04.386 --> 00:25:05.524
How was it again?

337
00:25:05.987 --> 00:25:08.024
"Your man...

338
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:11.603
...sent me."
OK, repeat that.


339
00:25:11.993 --> 00:25:13.904
"Your man..."

340
00:25:14.162 --> 00:25:15.470
- "Sent..."
- "Sent..."


341
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.837
- "Sent me"
- "Sent me"


342
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.910
Come on, with attitude,
like you mean it.


343
00:25:21.503 --> 00:25:23.574
"Your man...

344
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:25.585
sent..."

345
00:25:25.974 --> 00:25:27.612
"...sent me."
Like this.


346
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:28.921
"...sent me."

347
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.489
- "...to talk..."
- "...to talk..."


348
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.085
- "...to you..."
- "...to you..."


349
00:25:33.348 --> 00:25:34.588
- "You copy?"
- "You copy?"


350
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.421
You need to remember that one
so you know if she copies.


351
00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:40.592
You're going to give her
this card's numbers.


352
00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:45.332
Just deliver the message
and make it simple.


353
00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:50.009
"Your... man...

354
00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:54.479
...says: call him".

355
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:59.441
"Your... man... says...

356
00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:03.616
- ...call him".
- Is that a cock you're sucking?


357
00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:05.686
What do you mean?
That's what you just did.


358
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:07.358
Are you calling me a cocksucker?

359
00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:08.620
If the shoe fits...

360
00:26:08.917 --> 00:26:10.590
I'll keep my eyes
on you, understood?


361
00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:40.257
What's up, rookie?
Are you climbing up?


362
00:26:40.615 --> 00:26:42.595
- Yeah.
- Well then, grab a bucket.


363
00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:08.847
What's with you?

364
00:27:09.144 --> 00:27:11.283
You're gutsy talking to Yanelly!

365
00:27:11.913 --> 00:27:14.450
- Manaury sent me.
- Oh, that's okay then.


366
00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:19.964
"I came to talk to you...

367
00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:24.466
...about something
on behalf of your man."


368
00:27:24.993 --> 00:27:25.971
"You copy?"

369
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:29.802
"Are you the new inmate
that just arrived?"


370
00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:31.235
What is she saying?

371
00:27:31.433 --> 00:27:34.812
She's asking if you're the inmate,
that just arrived.


372
00:27:36.838 --> 00:27:38.579
- How do I say yes?
- Like this.


373
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.818
"Yes."

374
00:27:40.008 --> 00:27:43.421
"Do you know where
my partner is right now?"


375
00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.822
She's saying something else...

376
00:27:46.848 --> 00:27:50.819
She asks where did they
send her man to?


377
00:27:56.958 --> 00:28:00.269
"Your man is in...

378
00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:04.275
...another prison now."

379
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.111
"But, but, but...

380
00:28:10.538 --> 00:28:13.451
"You can call him
at this number..."


381
00:28:14.075 --> 00:28:15.952
...so you...

382
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.485
...can speak with him."

383
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.451
Wendy, do you have a piece of paper
so I can write down a number?


384
00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:25.120
Here you go, babe.

385
00:28:25.253 --> 00:28:26.857
I'll give it back to you later.

386
00:28:27.088 --> 00:28:28.294
About the numbers...

387
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:32.233
For instance, this number?
How do you signal it?


388
00:28:32.494 --> 00:28:33.564
Go like this:

389
00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:37.505
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 6."

390
00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:39.573
Mind helping me?

391
00:28:39.934 --> 00:28:41.311
"Alright."

392
00:28:43.104 --> 00:28:43.912
One.

393
00:28:44.105 --> 00:28:47.814
- This one?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.


394
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.991
- This one...?
- 1, 2, 3, and 4.


395
00:28:54.849 --> 00:28:58.319
- This one?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.


396
00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.997
Is she copying?

397
00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:01.326
- Ask her.
- Of course!


398
00:29:01.856 --> 00:29:02.926
"Alright."

399
00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:05.600
- That's it.
- Good.


400
00:29:06.127 --> 00:29:07.105
That's it.

401
00:29:07.195 --> 00:29:08.833
She's got it now.

402
00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:11.371
“Alright?

403
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.436
"Good."

404
00:29:20.809 --> 00:29:22.880
Thanks, Wendy.
I owe you one.


405
00:29:29.084 --> 00:29:30.791
So...

406
00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:34.889
"I... the inmate...

407
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.368
who...

408
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:39.471
...doesn't... have...

409
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.308
...too... long."

410
00:29:47.102 --> 00:29:50.311
"I... inmate... who...

411
00:29:51.506 --> 00:29:53.486
...doesn't have...

412
00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:56.852
...too... long in here."

413
00:29:58.947 --> 00:30:02.087
"I want to talk...

414
00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:04.555
...to you."

415
00:30:04.853 --> 00:30:05.991
"Copy?"

416
00:30:07.355 --> 00:30:08.333
"Copy?"

417
00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:11.093
Take some
so you can learn to do it.


418
00:31:11.186 --> 00:31:13.132
What sentence did they give you?

419
00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:16.098
They haven't.
I'm on preventive detention for robbery.


420
00:31:16.357 --> 00:31:18.200
They'll give you at least two years.

421
00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:21.502
You'll need someone on the outside
to speed up the paperwork.


422
00:31:21.863 --> 00:31:23.934
So what about your old man?
What does he do?


423
00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:26.504
He was in the military.

424
00:31:26.868 --> 00:31:28.176
Nice, you got it made...

425
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:29.848
He's dead.

426
00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:32.348
Damn, bro.
So what about your mother?


427
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.010
I don't know.
In Haiti.


428
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.187
Ah so you are Haitian!

429
00:31:39.047 --> 00:31:41.118
- I was born here.
- Where is here?


430
00:31:41.382 --> 00:31:42.952
In Dajabon, like my dad.

431
00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:45.127
Well, same thing,
you were born on the border.


432
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.200
You're from neither
here or there, dumbass.


433
00:31:55.396 --> 00:31:57.637
Anyway, if you don't get someone
to expedite your case...


434
00:31:57.999 --> 00:31:59.478
...it will get really ugly for you.

435
00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.613
I've been here for 8 years
and in a couple more...


436
00:32:01.903 --> 00:32:04.975
...I'll apply for parole, then you'll
see me outside prancing like a lion.


437
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:07.384
You see, I have murdered some folks...

438
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:10.820
You know, once in a while,
for business reasons, 'cause I'm a hustler.


439
00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:12.157
You copy?

440
00:32:12.847 --> 00:32:14.417
Our thing was larceny and robbery.

441
00:32:14.616 --> 00:32:17.256
I was in charge
of driving and looking out...

442
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:21.258
That's why you're such a dumbass,
you never got your hands dirty.


443
00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:23.993
You think they caught me
with my dick in my hands!?


444
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:27.469
The driver is the sitting duck of the bunch.
He has both hands busy.


445
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:31.008
Well, grab that ladle and get busy and
at least learn how to cook.


446
00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:32.542
So you won't have it hard here.

447
00:32:33.635 --> 00:32:37.014
Look, watch you don't sack my woman.

448
00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:40.349
Don't play dumb with me
so I won't have to straighten you up.


449
00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:42.613
- I'm done.
- Where are you going?


450
00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:44.284
To the cell blocks.

451
00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:46.857
Well, you can signal Yanelly
on your way there.


452
00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:48.857
Tell her to send me
that thing she knows.


453
00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.891
- What thing?
- You're going to tell her this.


454
00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:54.033
"Send him that thing you know."

455
00:32:54.556 --> 00:32:56.366
She'll understand.
And ask her to send me...


456
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.029
...another photo.
I'm tired of jerking off to the same one.


457
00:32:58.159 --> 00:33:00.469
- So how do you say "photo"?
- Like this.


458
00:33:02.163 --> 00:33:03.141
Hey.

459
00:33:03.998 --> 00:33:05.204
I'm watching you,
you hear?


460
00:33:05.667 --> 00:33:07.647
Do what I say, and you'll be fine.

461
00:33:13.441 --> 00:33:16.979
"Your man wants another one."

462
00:33:18.112 --> 00:33:19.318
"Another what?"

463
00:33:19.614 --> 00:33:20.991
"Photo."

464
00:33:21.349 --> 00:33:24.990
"But I don't want to
send him another one."


465
00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:32.326
"He wants the photo to jerk off."

466
00:33:37.465 --> 00:33:42.107
"Not like that!
Quit messing around!"


467
00:33:45.473 --> 00:33:47.180
"OK."

468
00:33:50.144 --> 00:33:54.524
"You make yourself very clear.
I really like that."


469
00:33:57.385 --> 00:34:02.027
"I'm just the messenger."

470
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:09.303
"Tell him to leave me alone.
I'm sending no photos."


471
00:34:11.432 --> 00:34:13.412
"She says no."

472
00:34:14.268 --> 00:34:16.248
"Ask her why."

473
00:34:19.007 --> 00:34:21.419
"Why not?"

474
00:34:23.177 --> 00:34:26.420
"Because when I was
in solitary confinement...


475
00:34:27.048 --> 00:34:29.858
...he was flirting with someone else."

476
00:34:30.284 --> 00:34:32.264
"Tell him to leave me alone."

477
00:34:35.356 --> 00:34:38.098
"Because you were
flirting with someone else."


478
00:34:39.293 --> 00:34:42.172
"Leave her alone.
Don't say anything else."


479
00:34:43.297 --> 00:34:44.503
What?

480
00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:46.940
"Come down!"

481
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.951
JELIN, MARRY ME?
I'm in love!


482
00:34:54.142 --> 00:34:56.622
I love you! I love you!
Of course I'll marry you!


483
00:34:57.045 --> 00:34:58.615
As soon as
I get out of here, baby!


484
00:35:07.555 --> 00:35:10.900
When women act like this you just
take the road and they stop the hassle.


485
00:35:10.992 --> 00:35:14.132
You got to tell her I was just asking
her friends where she was.


486
00:35:14.328 --> 00:35:16.467
- Okay.
- Do you think "pecker-talking" is cheap?


487
00:35:16.597 --> 00:35:19.305
I send her 500 pesos constantly
and pay for her cell phone.


488
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.070
So she can't fuck with me.

489
00:35:21.436 --> 00:35:23.074
How do you send her the money?

490
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:26.184
I just send it! You don't need
to know the details, "pokemon".


491
00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:29.414
- Not like I'm interested anyways.
- You better not.


492
00:35:31.512 --> 00:35:34.152
Well well, you're really quick!

493
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.588
Look at this!

494
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.566
What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.


495
00:35:42.023 --> 00:35:45.493
I'm here doing my time mindful that
you won't stab me with that rusty knife.


496
00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.431
Hey, watch what you say...
What do you want?


497
00:35:48.629 --> 00:35:51.269
I have you working in the kitchen.
Would you rather scrub toilets?


498
00:35:51.365 --> 00:35:52.844
Do I look like a cook to you?

499
00:35:53.134 --> 00:35:54.613
Put me to work in your operation.

500
00:35:54.969 --> 00:35:55.947
What operation?

501
00:35:56.137 --> 00:35:58.515
You better learn how to cook
so you never go to jail again, dumbass.


502
00:35:58.873 --> 00:36:00.181
Get out of my sight!

503
00:36:01.042 --> 00:36:02.521
Where are you going?
We're not done here.


504
00:36:02.643 --> 00:36:04.122
You don't have to know everything.

505
00:36:04.312 --> 00:36:07.452
Check under your seat.
Let me know if you want to keep going at it.


506
00:36:23.831 --> 00:36:25.902
"Didn't I tell him to leave me alone?"

507
00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:31.815
"He was just asking for you."

508
00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:36.815
"He's making you say nonsense."

509
00:36:37.078 --> 00:36:40.890
"What he says is a lie."

510
00:36:43.017 --> 00:36:48.091
"But he wants to
clear things up with you."


511
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:52.502
"I'm the one who is clear!"

512
00:36:55.196 --> 00:36:57.437
"Keep telling her it's a lie!"

513
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:03.009
- We need you in the kitchen.
- I'll be right there.


514
00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:06.452
- The merchandise got messed up.
- What do you mean messed up?


515
00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:09.282
- That stuff can't get damaged!
- Well, it did.


516
00:37:14.081 --> 00:37:16.960
"I'll be watching you."

517
00:37:35.603 --> 00:37:39.915
"Look, I have nothing to do with this."

518
00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:44.520
"I'm just the messenger."

519
00:37:46.447 --> 00:37:49.291
"Enough of that.
Let's talk about something else."


520
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:52.592
"What's up with you?"

521
00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:57.332
"What's up...

522
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.538
...with me?"

523
00:38:02.296 --> 00:38:04.503
"Yeah. I like you. 
You set me on fire"

524
00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:08.939
"But you don't...

525
00:38:09.637 --> 00:38:12.618
...know me."

526
00:38:13.975 --> 00:38:18.117
"That's OK. You'll soon realize
that if enough time...


527
00:38:18.279 --> 00:38:20.589
...is spent doing this..."

528
00:38:20.982 --> 00:38:25.055
"...you will learn to sense
my touch and my embrace"


529
00:38:30.157 --> 00:38:31.898
Down, everyone!

530
00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:37.569
Stand up.
To the wall.


531
00:38:39.267 --> 00:38:40.473
Get down.

532
00:38:41.602 --> 00:38:43.411
Stay down, everyone.

533
00:38:44.105 --> 00:38:46.483
So you're still
"pecker-talking" through this side?


534
00:38:47.341 --> 00:38:51.255
If I hear of one more brawl,
I'm boarding up all the windows.


535
00:38:53.948 --> 00:38:55.928
- Were you smoking?
- What do you mean?


536
00:38:56.017 --> 00:38:57.325
Show me your hands.

537
00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.326
Come on, sir, what's wrong?

538
00:39:00.621 --> 00:39:04.330
Be quite.
Be careful, I'm watching you.


539
00:39:05.026 --> 00:39:06.096
Be really careful.

540
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.167
Who knows how
to prune weed and grass?


541
00:39:08.362 --> 00:39:10.035
- Me, me!
- I do, I do!


542
00:39:12.133 --> 00:39:13.373
Silence!
Silence!


543
00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:16.374
None of you screaming queens
will do it.


544
00:39:18.139 --> 00:39:21.211
It's going to be you, you and you.

545
00:39:21.475 --> 00:39:24.046
Tomorrow morning
I'll send for you.


546
00:39:24.979 --> 00:39:26.287
You heard?

547
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.888
You heard me?

548
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:33.460
You look way better like that.
You look like somebody now.


549
00:39:35.323 --> 00:39:37.064
Be careful how you look at me.

550
00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:41.302
We'll talk tomorrow.

551
00:39:51.005 --> 00:39:52.416
Fuck. This shit is full of rice.

552
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.147
Rogelio punctured it
while moving it.


553
00:39:55.443 --> 00:39:57.582
Then he's paying for them.
Is this the only one damaged?


554
00:39:57.845 --> 00:39:58.823
Just that one.

555
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.419
I'm sick of telling you not to mix
this shit up with the rice!


556
00:40:01.615 --> 00:40:02.923
They're all getting messed up!

557
00:40:03.017 --> 00:40:04.587
How's the can
you had down stairs?


558
00:40:04.852 --> 00:40:05.421
It's OK.

559
00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:06.930
- You checked?
- Yeah.


560
00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:45.128
Next.

561
00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:48.530
Next.

562
00:41:31.972 --> 00:41:33.349
Here comes the guard!
Put it out!


563
00:41:37.878 --> 00:41:39.448
Do you think I didn't see you?

564
00:41:40.147 --> 00:41:41.956
Which of you three was smoking?

565
00:41:42.149 --> 00:41:43.287
We don't smoke.

566
00:41:45.653 --> 00:41:47.291
- None of you?
- No.


567
00:41:47.488 --> 00:41:48.523
Let me see your hands.

568
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:51.961
Ma'am, it was me.

569
00:41:54.061 --> 00:41:55.472
This is a non-smoking area.

570
00:41:57.331 --> 00:41:59.208
I don't care what you do
over there in your prison...


571
00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:00.869
...but smoking is prohibited here.

572
00:42:01.068 --> 00:42:02.638
Do you want me to report you
to your supervisor?


573
00:42:03.003 --> 00:42:04.141
It won't happen again.

574
00:42:05.673 --> 00:42:07.209
You three got off the hook...

575
00:42:08.008 --> 00:42:10.181
'cause I didn't catch you
with the cigarette in your hands.


576
00:42:10.845 --> 00:42:12.324
Now get back in.
The bell just rang.


577
00:42:21.122 --> 00:42:24.001
Which of you knows tech stuff and
air conditioning repair?


578
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.837
"Tell her you know how."

579
00:42:28.028 --> 00:42:29.006
I do.

580
00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:32.000
Come with me to my office
so you can fix my air conditioning.


581
00:42:32.199 --> 00:42:35.908
And maybe I can spare you from not having
to report this to your supervisors.


582
00:42:36.203 --> 00:42:37.181
Come this way.

583
00:43:31.025 --> 00:43:33.096
The filter is dirty, ma'am.

584
00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:36.098
I know it's dirty,
that's why I asked you to come.


585
00:43:36.363 --> 00:43:39.105
Even if I clean it,
I have to open it all up.


586
00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:42.447
I need tools I have
on the other side.


587
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.175
All right, but...

588
00:43:44.371 --> 00:43:47.147
I won't let you oft the hook that easy
after what you did back there.


589
00:43:47.308 --> 00:43:50.118
You have to come back tomorrow
with your tools to repair it.


590
00:43:55.482 --> 00:43:56.859
- Get me out of here!
- Hey! Hey!


591
00:43:57.218 --> 00:43:58.288
Wait over there.

592
00:43:58.652 --> 00:44:00.256
- Wait there and don't move.
- Yes, ma'am.


593
00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:02.526
- What's going on with you?
- Come here.


594
00:44:07.328 --> 00:44:08.864
- How is it going?
- All right.


595
00:44:09.096 --> 00:44:10.905
- What's your name?
- Julian.


596
00:44:11.498 --> 00:44:13.978
So you're the new inmate
from across the wall?


597
00:44:14.335 --> 00:44:15.313
Yes.

598
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.408
I am Yanelly.

599
00:44:17.605 --> 00:44:19.585
I know. You're famous
back there.


600
00:44:22.509 --> 00:44:24.420
Come on, open the door!

601
00:44:25.613 --> 00:44:26.591
Yes?

602
00:44:26.847 --> 00:44:28.326
The supervisor locked me in here.

603
00:44:28.515 --> 00:44:29.585
Why?

604
00:44:30.184 --> 00:44:32.164
- I don't know.
- You don't know why?


605
00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.294
She locked you in because
you have no business being in here.


606
00:44:36.123 --> 00:44:37.329
Are you going to let me out?

607
00:44:37.524 --> 00:44:39.265
- Are you going to behave?
- Yes.


608
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.167
So why are you sending me
messages from Manaury?


609
00:44:42.463 --> 00:44:45.444
- I get paid for it.
- So you're a messenger boy?


610
00:44:45.633 --> 00:44:47.840
- Hey, dial that down a bit?
- Tell me something.


611
00:44:48.035 --> 00:44:49.446
What do you want me
to talk you about?


612
00:44:49.536 --> 00:44:51.277
- About you.
- Me?


613
00:44:52.039 --> 00:44:53.017
Alright.

614
00:44:53.374 --> 00:44:55.980
- Are you going to keep coming back?
- You can count on it.


615
00:44:57.144 --> 00:44:59.021
- What's that mean?
- Pure, pure, pure.


616
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.621
- The way I like people to be.
- Yeah...


617
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:05.621
- I like your mouth.
- Move it! Move it!


618
00:45:06.053 --> 00:45:08.465
You know you can't be
in a block you don't belong to!


619
00:45:08.656 --> 00:45:10.795
Walk! Move it! And you!
Didn't I tell you to wait right there?


620
00:45:10.991 --> 00:45:12.061
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:45:13.594 --> 00:45:16.973
- You haven't seen me.
- No, it's OK.


622
00:45:23.437 --> 00:45:24.575
Come on, move!

623
00:45:24.838 --> 00:45:26.476
You came here to work,
not to fall in love.


624
00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:29.254
- Thank you so much.
- You owe me one.


625
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.618
Move.

626
00:46:03.644 --> 00:46:05.214
Did Yanelly send
anything to me?


627
00:46:06.046 --> 00:46:07.457
I didn't see her.

628
00:46:11.585 --> 00:46:13.223
What are you nuts?!

629
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.063
- Don't you dare lie to me, OK?
- I told you I didn't see her.


630
00:46:17.257 --> 00:46:18.964
I have eyes and
ears all over this prison.

631
00:46:19.093 --> 00:46:21.232
If I find out anything at all,
you're fucked.


632
00:46:21.428 --> 00:46:24.068
Stop you goddamn threats!

633
00:46:25.165 --> 00:46:27.975
This is a two way street.
You tell her to call me tonight!


634
00:46:28.102 --> 00:46:29.979
And if I feel like it, I'll come thru
with your stuff for you tomorrow.


635
00:46:30.137 --> 00:46:31.445
Are you following me?

636
00:46:41.515 --> 00:46:43.358
Did you check the current
out of the breakers?


637
00:46:43.517 --> 00:46:44.495
No.

638
00:46:44.618 --> 00:46:47.098
Did you measure the current
going into the motor?


639
00:46:47.955 --> 00:46:49.832
All I know is
that thing won't start.


640
00:46:49.957 --> 00:46:51.994
There should be a circuit-card in here.

641
00:46:52.192 --> 00:46:54.263
It's not here but
you should have seen it.


642
00:46:54.862 --> 00:46:56.102
I don't know.

643
00:46:56.196 --> 00:46:58.836
Bro, give him a hand,
he is one of my guys.


644
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:04.942
This is what we'll do.
Tell the guards you're coming with me.


645
00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:11.115
And we'll fix it together, that way I can
tag along to catch some of that girl action.


646
00:47:12.146 --> 00:47:13.386
Alright.

647
00:47:26.827 --> 00:47:28.465
Oh, baby!

648
00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:42.083
That looks good!

649
00:47:42.843 --> 00:47:44.151
Looks great!

650
00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:48.085
- Watch it!
- Watch what?!


651
00:47:49.016 --> 00:47:51.496
Tell me, Marily.
What was that all about?


652
00:47:52.186 --> 00:47:53.995
Nothing happened?
Nothing?!


653
00:47:54.188 --> 00:47:57.431
Don't you have anything to say?
Stand right here.


654
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.839
Everybody else go back.
Wait for me in the office.


655
00:48:04.298 --> 00:48:05.606
Come on, move.

656
00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:10.373
You're going to solitary confinement
for thirty days!


657
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:13.177
Let's see it you pull the same stunt
over there! Shame on you!


658
00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:19.390
We've had enough of this.
Who do you think you are?


659
00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:22.293
"Pecker-talking", you call it.

660
00:48:23.584 --> 00:48:24.961
Aren't you ashamed?

661
00:48:25.919 --> 00:48:28.559
"Pecking."
What does that mean?


662
00:48:31.925 --> 00:48:33.404
Oh, so nobody knows!

663
00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:37.240
You spent the whole day doing it
and nobody knows what it means?


664
00:48:37.598 --> 00:48:39.305
The guys came up with that.

665
00:48:40.267 --> 00:48:43.476
The thing is that when
the woodpeckers drill their holes...


666
00:48:43.604 --> 00:48:45.345
...they grasp on to the tree...

667
00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:47.816
...the same way that
the guys climb to the windows...


668
00:48:47.975 --> 00:48:50.114
...and grab on to the rails
so they can talk to us.


669
00:48:50.277 --> 00:48:52.814
Oh, one that knows.

670
00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:58.159
Next time you're caught
"woodpecking" or whatever...


671
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.325
...you'll have your
visitation rights suspended.


672
00:49:01.455 --> 00:49:03.935
And one month in solitary confinement.

673
00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:07.166
- Am I clear?
- Yes, ma'am.


674
00:49:07.861 --> 00:49:09.101
You may go.

675
00:49:11.064 --> 00:49:12.099
You stay.

676
00:49:12.299 --> 00:49:13.277
Me?

677
00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:14.944
Yes, you.

678
00:49:21.141 --> 00:49:24.782
- Do you want to mess things up now?
- I wasn't "pecker-talking".


679
00:49:25.312 --> 00:49:26.552
Not today.

680
00:49:26.914 --> 00:49:29.053
But you won't take
your eyes off that window.


681
00:49:30.417 --> 00:49:32.260
You have one foot out the door already.

682
00:49:33.253 --> 00:49:36.791
- But I have the last word.
- Yes, ma'am.


683
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.070
I hope your time here
has been useful.


684
00:49:39.993 --> 00:49:41.233
It has.

685
00:49:42.262 --> 00:49:44.299
You'll be cheated on again.

686
00:49:45.832 --> 00:49:48.369
But you can't burn a house down
for every cheater out there.


687
00:49:48.635 --> 00:49:49.340
Ma'am...

688
00:49:49.603 --> 00:49:52.049
It's not easy when
a son of a bitch shows in your life...


689
00:49:52.172 --> 00:49:55.984
and after you clean his house,
look after and tend to him,


690
00:49:56.176 --> 00:49:58.986
he just goes and cheats on you,
making you feel stupid...


691
00:49:59.179 --> 00:50:00.419
...while he sleeps around.

692
00:50:00.547 --> 00:50:01.525
Listen...

693
00:50:01.848 --> 00:50:03.259
You have to be smarter.

694
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.361
I don't want to see you
around here again.


695
00:50:06.453 --> 00:50:08.262
I have good news for you.

696
00:50:12.125 --> 00:50:14.162
The sentence
for your divorce is in.


697
00:50:16.196 --> 00:50:17.937
You are now single.

698
00:50:19.199 --> 00:50:21.008
That's good news, yes.

699
00:50:22.035 --> 00:50:23.275
You may leave.

700
00:50:23.637 --> 00:50:26.174
And keep a low profile, okay?

701
00:50:26.373 --> 00:50:27.613
Thanks, ma'am.

702
00:51:54.227 --> 00:51:56.867
You heard the bell.
Go back to your cell blocks!


703
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.979
You too!

704
00:52:06.239 --> 00:52:07.547
Hand me the meter.

705
00:52:13.447 --> 00:52:14.425
Look here.

706
00:52:14.614 --> 00:52:16.992
When it reaches 220,
let me know.


707
00:52:17.184 --> 00:52:18.254
Okay.

708
00:52:19.953 --> 00:52:22.160
- What does it say?
- 220.


709
00:52:25.192 --> 00:52:26.500
Let's see here...

710
00:52:27.027 --> 00:52:29.940
- What about now?
- Four zeros.


711
00:52:30.197 --> 00:52:32.108
That's it.
Just a burnt fuse.


712
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.178
I see.

713
00:52:36.036 --> 00:52:37.447
Everything is under control.

714
00:52:37.637 --> 00:52:40.846
The ones heading to college,
come out orderly.


715
00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:43.519
God damn it.

716
00:52:45.479 --> 00:52:46.457
Hurry up.

717
00:52:46.646 --> 00:52:48.023
Rita...

718
00:52:48.482 --> 00:52:48.590
- You're going to college, right?
- Yeah.


719
00:52:48.615 --> 00:52:50.617
- You're going to college, right?
- Yeah.


720
00:52:51.218 --> 00:52:53.858
- I need to ask you another favor.
- What is it?


721
00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:55.199
Here.

722
00:52:56.056 --> 00:52:59.128
I need this delivered to Julian.

723
00:52:59.326 --> 00:53:01.306
- For fuck's sake, Yanelly.
- What?


724
00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:04.369
I'm not your delivery boy.
I'm not doing you anymore favors.


725
00:53:04.498 --> 00:53:06.535
Please, don't come undone on me now.

726
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.911
Come on, you can have
my phone minutes for tonight.


727
00:53:08.935 --> 00:53:10.915
I'm not interested.
I'm taking a lot of heat because of you.


728
00:53:11.004 --> 00:53:12.608
What do you mean because of me?

729
00:53:13.006 --> 00:53:14.246
Please?

730
00:53:15.008 --> 00:53:16.248
Look.

731
00:53:19.846 --> 00:53:20.916
A keeper or loaner?

732
00:53:21.114 --> 00:53:22.320
A keeper!

733
00:53:25.952 --> 00:53:27.431
- Here.
- Okay.


734
00:53:27.854 --> 00:53:31.495
Don't say it's from me.
And this too.


735
00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:34.435
Here's 50 for the messenger.

736
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:38.100
Alright.

737
00:53:39.866 --> 00:53:41.174
What happened out there?

738
00:53:42.536 --> 00:53:44.948
A stove caught on fire in the kitchen.

739
00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:48.277
- We know how to put out fires too.
- Of course, I'm sure of that.


740
00:53:48.475 --> 00:53:52.184
Go back to work. The girls are not
catching fire anytime soon.


741
00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:54.455
Well, just in case, you know.

742
00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:56.519
I know, but mind your own business.

743
00:54:01.988 --> 00:54:03.296
Pockets.

744
00:54:06.993 --> 00:54:09.803
Hold the notebook.
Arms up.


745
00:54:13.934 --> 00:54:15.140
Follow me.

746
00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:19.142
It's ready.

747
00:55:12.492 --> 00:55:14.130
Here is a delivery for you.

748
00:55:36.016 --> 00:55:39.589
"Sign up for music lessons...

749
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.627
...and dance class."

750
00:55:42.355 --> 00:55:44.995
"We'll have some guests
in a couple days...


751
00:55:45.358 --> 00:55:48.828
...and we're preparing
a show for them."


752
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:51.837
"We can meet there."

753
00:55:52.132 --> 00:55:55.170
"Signed, your woodpecker."

754
00:55:56.136 --> 00:55:58.946
Shit, man, you're the man!

755
00:55:59.973 --> 00:56:02.180
You scored one
that's almost out the door!


756
00:56:02.375 --> 00:56:04.616
Before you realize
you'll be in love with her.


757
00:56:04.878 --> 00:56:05.856
With whom?

758
00:56:06.046 --> 00:56:08.959
Easy, dude.
I'm not on Manaury's side.


759
00:56:09.582 --> 00:56:11.960
Do you know whose side I'm on?

760
00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:13.457
On the the Lord's side.

761
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:14.890
Gimme a break...

762
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:17.032
Calm down, Romeo.

763
00:56:18.091 --> 00:56:20.435
For what it's worth,
tailing in love isn't a bad thing.


764
00:56:25.832 --> 00:56:27.072
Thanks, Bolo.

765
00:56:27.434 --> 00:56:28.970
See you.

766
00:56:29.336 --> 00:56:32.317
Are you falling for
the asshole delivering my messages?


767
00:56:32.439 --> 00:56:33.918
Leave me alone.

768
00:56:34.007 --> 00:56:36.487
What do you mean?
What am I going to do with you?


769
00:56:36.843 --> 00:56:37.981
I don't know.

770
00:56:38.178 --> 00:56:40.158
You know well that I hate to get
involved with cheaters.


771
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.157
If I find out you're
dating another asshole...


772
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:44.488
- If I find out...
- What will you do?


773
00:56:44.851 --> 00:56:46.091
I'll slaughter him!

774
00:56:46.186 --> 00:56:48.427
And I swear on my mom's grave
that I'll send you his parts in a bag!


775
00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:50.000
And we'll see what you do then!

776
00:56:50.123 --> 00:56:50.931
Shut the fuck up!

777
00:56:51.057 --> 00:56:53.936
This boat is mine and I'll dock it
anywhere I give a damn!


778
00:56:54.127 --> 00:56:55.606
You fucking whore!

779
00:56:56.629 --> 00:56:58.131
Do anything you want with the phone.

780
00:56:58.198 --> 00:56:59.609
Whore!
You fucking whore!


781
00:56:59.966 --> 00:57:01.274
Shut up.
We're trying to sleep.


782
00:57:01.368 --> 00:57:03.348
Shut the fuck up you piece of shit!

783
00:57:11.978 --> 00:57:14.458
"What's up with you, baby?"

784
00:57:15.081 --> 00:57:18.961
"Hi honey. What are you doing
on the window so early?"


785
00:57:20.487 --> 00:57:24.458
"I happened to spend the night..."

786
00:57:25.925 --> 00:57:29.805
"...thinking so much about you."

787
00:57:30.163 --> 00:57:33.303
"All night thinking about me?"

788
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:34.476
"Sure."

789
00:57:34.501 --> 00:57:34.979
"Sure."

790
00:57:35.502 --> 00:57:37.072
"And you?"

791
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:38.248
"Yeah."

792
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.149
"Did you like the little
present I sent you?"


793
00:57:44.444 --> 00:57:48.256
"The thing that covers
the other thing?"


794
00:57:48.515 --> 00:57:49.493
"Yes."

795
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:51.488
"Of course!"

796
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:58.501
"Will you sign up for the music class?"

797
00:58:23.249 --> 00:58:24.227
Hey buddy.

798
00:58:24.317 --> 00:58:26.388
Help me with a sack
of rice back there?


799
00:58:28.488 --> 00:58:30.559
Bro, my back is a mess
from all those sacks.


800
00:58:30.924 --> 00:58:31.333
It's the ones in the back.

801
00:58:31.357 --> 00:58:32.165
It's the ones in the back.

802
00:58:34.394 --> 00:58:35.532
Those over there.

803
00:58:37.163 --> 00:58:38.574
Go ahead, I'm behind you.

804
00:58:40.166 --> 00:58:41.406
These ones?

805
00:58:42.168 --> 00:58:44.910
I warned you, cocksucker!

806
00:58:45.171 --> 00:58:45.746
I made myself clear!
And yet you stabbed me in the back!


807
00:58:45.772 --> 00:58:48.309
I made myself clear!
And yet you stabbed me in the back!


808
00:58:48.608 --> 00:58:51.316
I'm not "pecker-talking"
with your woman!


809
00:58:51.511 --> 00:58:54.321
I told you I have eyes
and ears all over the place!


810
00:58:54.514 --> 00:58:55.993
I told you and you didn't believe it.

811
00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:58.323
Now talk! And fast!

812
00:58:58.451 --> 00:58:59.760
I'm just relaying to her
what you tell me.


813
00:58:59.786 --> 00:59:00.321
I'm just relaying to her
what you tell me.


814
00:59:00.453 --> 00:59:02.433
Like hell you are!
Listen to me now!


815
00:59:02.522 --> 00:59:05.594
If I see you talking to Yanelly again
here or anywhere.


816
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:07.597
I'll skin you myself!

817
00:59:07.861 --> 00:59:10.774
- You should have played along with me.
- Leave him, leave him!


818
00:59:11.798 --> 00:59:13.209
Take a hike, pokemon!

819
00:59:13.299 --> 00:59:14.175
- Move it, man!
- Move it, you fag!


820
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.270
- Move it, man!
- Move it, you fag!


821
00:59:18.304 --> 00:59:20.443
You should have
played along, cocksucker.


822
01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:34.124
Whatever happened to you, man?

823
01:00:34.314 --> 01:00:36.521
Leave me alone,
I'm busy right now, OK?


824
01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:37.861
Okay.

825
01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:16.491
Who are you?

826
01:01:16.956 --> 01:01:17.934
Julian.

827
01:01:18.157 --> 01:01:19.966
From which block?

828
01:01:20.293 --> 01:01:22.170
Cell 6, from San Cristobal.

829
01:01:22.362 --> 01:01:22.704
- What do you want?
- I want to sign up.


830
01:01:22.729 --> 01:01:24.606
- What do you want?
- I want to sign up.


831
01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.803
- Good morning!

832
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.966
- Good morning!
- Good morning, sir!


833
01:03:03.229 --> 01:03:04.367

01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:16.818

839
01:03:16.843 --> 01:03:18.481
- Enrique Acosta.
- Here, sir.


840
01:03:19.278 --> 01:03:20.985
What is this?
Come over here.


841
01:03:22.281 --> 01:03:23.885
What have I told you about this?

842
01:03:24.016 --> 01:03:25.324
- Excuse me, sir.
- Excuse you what?!


843
01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:27.021
- What have I told you?
- Excuse me, sir.


844
01:03:27.186 --> 01:03:28.995
I've told you a thousand times
that's forbidden here!


845
01:03:29.122 --> 01:03:30.157
I'm sorry, sir!

846
01:03:30.456 --> 01:03:31.232
Take him. Handcuff him.

847
01:03:31.257 --> 01:03:32.429
Take him. Handcuff him.

848
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:36.169
Where was I?

849
01:03:36.863 --> 01:03:39.002
- Antonio Fadul.
- Here, sir.


850
01:03:39.532 --> 01:03:41.273
- Joselito Manuel.
- Here, sir.


851
01:03:42.468 --> 01:03:43.845
- Enrique Acosta.
- Present.


852
01:03:45.204 --> 01:03:45.646
Well guys, we're short of
a drummer.


853
01:03:45.671 --> 01:03:47.514
Well guys, we're short of
a drummer.


854
01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.485
So who's up to it?

855
01:03:49.642 --> 01:03:51.121
I could do it.

856
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:52.587
But you've never played that drum.

857
01:03:52.879 --> 01:03:55.120
I've been watching Miguel a lot.
I can do this.


858
01:03:55.648 --> 01:03:58.288
Well then let's give it a try,
see how he does.


859
01:03:59.385 --> 01:03:59.660
Well, as you can see,
this is the cell block.


860
01:03:59.685 --> 01:04:01.289
Well, as you can see,
this is the cell block.


861
01:04:01.387 --> 01:04:05.130
Inmates with green shirts
are in preventive detention,


862
01:04:05.892 --> 01:04:07.530
the ones in blue
have been convicted.


863
01:04:07.894 --> 01:04:09.567
And this here is the cafeteria...

864
01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:12.598
How do you think Roman
will react when he sees me?


865
01:04:12.999 --> 01:04:14.075
How about Javielito?

866
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:14.976
How about Javielito?

867
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.911
You've been way too quiet.

868
01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.584
- You girls talk too much.
- And you don't talk.


869
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.977
- I don't have anything to say.
- Sure...


870
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.247
What do I have to say?

871
01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:26.016
Just don't get nervous
when you see him...


872
01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:26.920
Don't worry.

873
01:04:27.013 --> 01:04:28.089
You know he will be there.

874
01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:28.319
You know he will be there.

875
01:04:33.519 --> 01:04:34.497
OK.

876
01:04:34.921 --> 01:04:38.061
You have to wait for my count.
One, two, three.


877
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.170
On the count of three,
you join in along him.


878
01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.498
The "güira" starts with me.

879
01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:44.835
Now pick up your instruments,
we're going on stage.


880
01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:49.447
Good morning, fellow inmates...

881
01:04:49.635 --> 01:04:52.445
...and various authorities
gathering here today...


882
01:04:52.538 --> 01:04:55.348
...in what we call
the 7th Penitentiary Festival!


883
01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:56.918
Now we present the girls
from Najayo Female Penitentiary.


884
01:04:56.943 --> 01:04:58.013
Now we present the girls
from Najayo Female Penitentiary.


885
01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.384
Come over here girls.

886
01:04:59.545 --> 01:05:01.183
Applause!

887
01:05:04.617 --> 01:05:05.595
Very good!

888
01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:08.465
Along with the boys
from Najayo Male Penitentiary,


889
01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:10.463
the Paleros!
Come on in, guys!


890
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:12.560
Applause!

891
01:06:29.602 --> 01:06:30.979
What's up, man?

892
01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:34.413
Get out of here Manaury.
You know you're banned here.


893
01:06:35.508 --> 01:06:36.617
Are you still on Cell 6?

894
01:06:36.642 --> 01:06:37.245
Are you still on Cell 6?

895
01:06:37.343 --> 01:06:38.583
Yeah.

896
01:06:39.278 --> 01:06:42.589
Didn't you lose a small,
black phone recently?


897
01:06:44.517 --> 01:06:45.996
Who stole it?

898
01:06:46.118 --> 01:06:47.426
Open up and I'll tell you.

899
01:06:48.854 --> 01:06:49.992
Alright.

900
01:07:14.413 --> 01:07:15.391
Shit!

901
01:07:24.323 --> 01:07:25.961
Fuck!

902
01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:53.421
Big applause for them.

903
01:07:53.619 --> 01:07:57.499
The girls from Najayo CCR2
and the boys from Najayo CCR17!


904
01:07:57.623 --> 01:07:59.102
Put your hands together!

905
01:08:03.863 --> 01:08:08.175
And to continue with this show,
I'll present you a special artist...


906
01:08:08.634 --> 01:08:10.045
Could you...?

907
01:08:12.238 --> 01:08:15.776
- Hello, pretty lady.
- Hi. You did good.


908
01:08:19.478 --> 01:08:21.890
- Stealing, huh?
- You didn't like it?


909
01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:24.123
Of course.
You're good at it.


910
01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:27.124
And you...
Did I steal you?


911
01:08:28.988 --> 01:08:30.797
- Almost.
- Almost?


912
01:08:30.923 --> 01:08:31.132
- Almost.
- What do I have to do?


913
01:08:31.157 --> 01:08:32.568
- Almost.
- What do I have to do?


914
01:08:32.992 --> 01:08:34.198
You know...

915
01:08:34.994 --> 01:08:36.974
To give all myself to you,
you have to do the same for me.


916
01:08:37.163 --> 01:08:38.403
How so?

917
01:08:39.932 --> 01:08:41.570
You must marry me.

918
01:08:41.934 --> 01:08:43.572
Marry? What?

919
01:08:43.936 --> 01:08:45.146
- What are you laughing at?
- You're laughing too.


920
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:47.151
- What are you laughing at?
- You're laughing too.


921
01:08:47.273 --> 01:08:49.810
- Do you think I'm easy? I'm not easy.
- Bravo!


922
01:08:53.512 --> 01:08:55.150
What a pretty surprise.

923
01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:57.619
You should have seen
yourselves from my seat.


924
01:08:57.917 --> 01:08:59.487
People were amazed.

925
01:09:01.954 --> 01:09:04.093
You're such a star, nigga.

926
01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:06.265
Get off.

927
01:09:06.525 --> 01:09:08.334
Easy, no need to be rude.

928
01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:11.208
- You too.
- Thanks.


929
01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.908
- Was that performance for you?
- What do you think?


930
01:09:16.469 --> 01:09:19.109
- What a pretty hairdo.
- Get off.


931
01:09:20.139 --> 01:09:23.279
- What do you want?
- Just to congratulate you both.


932
01:09:23.476 --> 01:09:24.955
Congratulate?

933
01:09:25.978 --> 01:09:27.787
Well, you've done it,
take a hike.


934
01:09:29.815 --> 01:09:31.123
Good job.

935
01:09:33.085 --> 01:09:34.393
You too.

936
01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.135
There are no more excuses.

937
01:09:44.597 --> 01:09:47.077
Well, that will depend on you.
You know what to do.


938
01:09:47.266 --> 01:09:49.473
- And be careful with that asshole.
- Sure.


939
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:53.241
Come over here.

940
01:09:59.345 --> 01:10:03.589
"Love medicine I need from you"

941
01:10:04.016 --> 01:10:06.929
"... 'cause you are the only woman..."

942
01:10:09.088 --> 01:10:12.069
"...that can cure me from..."

943
01:10:12.525 --> 01:10:16.837
"...my cancer of love."

944
01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:44.533
Excellent job from our brother,
singing this "bachata"!


945
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:49.029
And with this we finalize
this wonderful show!


946
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:54.302
Now we'll orderly wait for dismissal...

947
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.310
...to go back to our cell blocks.
Thank you so much!


948
01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:01.875
Come on, keep moving!

949
01:11:06.912 --> 01:11:07.982
Come in, office...

950
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:11.127
Shut down all the cell blocks and bring
me back the inmates that were here...


951
01:11:11.317 --> 01:11:12.295
...right away!

952
01:11:12.451 --> 01:11:14.590
And lock the front and back doors!

953
01:11:31.637 --> 01:11:33.310
Do any of you
have anything to say?


954
01:11:33.973 --> 01:11:36.112
Is anybody hiding anything
they should give back?


955
01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:40.184
Do it now.
Don't make this harder.


956
01:11:41.313 --> 01:11:43.350
- What about you, Julian?
- What you mean?


957
01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:45.357
Step forward.

958
01:11:45.985 --> 01:11:47.191
Step forward!

959
01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.199
Check him.

960
01:11:53.325 --> 01:11:54.633
I don't have anything!

961
01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:04.543
- That's not mine!
- Quiet!


962
01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.646
- That's not mine, someone must...
- I said quiet!


963
01:12:09.842 --> 01:12:11.583
We'll find out soon enough.

964
01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.000
Are you trying to tell me
this isn't yours?


965
01:12:24.156 --> 01:12:26.227
We checked your cell and found this.

966
01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:29.838
This thing in your place,
isn't yours either?!


967
01:12:30.529 --> 01:12:32.167
That isn't mine, either!

968
01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:37.614
This isn't yours?
You're saying this isn't yours?!


969
01:12:38.971 --> 01:12:40.279
Really? Not yours?

970
01:12:40.873 --> 01:12:42.181
The pipe is.

971
01:12:43.642 --> 01:12:45.019
Who gave it to you?

972
01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:49.155
Who gave it to you?! Or you'll spend
two months in the hole!


973
01:12:49.548 --> 01:12:50.526
One.

974
01:12:51.483 --> 01:12:52.461
Two.

975
01:12:52.551 --> 01:12:53.859
From the kitchen.

976
01:12:53.986 --> 01:12:55.021
The kitchen where?

977
01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.358
The storage room.

978
01:12:56.488 --> 01:12:57.865
Fuck!

979
01:13:00.326 --> 01:13:03.307
Get four more guards
and check the storage room.


980
01:13:03.562 --> 01:13:07.305
Get back in the line.
And be careful how you behave.


981
01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:14.979
"Were you lying all this time?"

982
01:13:15.941 --> 01:13:19.821
"Those panties aren't mine!"

983
01:13:21.513 --> 01:13:25.427
"Then why did you have them?"

984
01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:28.090
"I don't know!"

985
01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.932
"Liar!"

986
01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:34.936
"You dirty dog,
just like the others!"


987
01:13:36.128 --> 01:13:37.835
Leave me alone!

988
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:39.600
Get off of me!
I have nothing to do with that shit!


989
01:13:39.865 --> 01:13:41.105
- I'm telling you!
- Shut up!


990
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.439
Alright, you're digging your grave.

991
01:13:43.635 --> 01:13:45.945
- You're just making it worse!
- Shut up!


992
01:13:48.307 --> 01:13:50.344
Shut up!
Shut up!


993
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.188
Shut your mouth!

994
01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:55.190
We found him in the kitchen.
Look what he had.


995
01:14:03.155 --> 01:14:05.135
- What is this?
- What is it?


996
01:14:05.224 --> 01:14:06.464
Don't you know what it is?

997
01:14:06.558 --> 01:14:09.061
It was that haitian pokemon that
put it in there!


998
01:14:10.329 --> 01:14:11.899
I'm sick of you.

999
01:14:12.264 --> 01:14:15.074
I've given you way too many opportunities.
Are you listening?!


1000
01:14:15.501 --> 01:14:17.412
Everyone that works in the kitchen,
Get out!


1001
01:14:17.503 --> 01:14:18.982
- Sir...
- Shut your mouth!


1002
01:14:19.104 --> 01:14:19.912
I said, shut up!

1003
01:14:20.005 --> 01:14:21.245
- Can we talk?
- Shut up!


1004
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.150
Want to talk?
Get their prison records ready!


1005
01:14:24.276 --> 01:14:25.482
You'll be sent to
La Victoria Penitentiary right away!


1006
01:14:25.844 --> 01:14:28.120
Prepare the trash truck,
that's where they're going!


1007
01:14:28.514 --> 01:14:29.993
Take them away!

1008
01:14:33.018 --> 01:14:34.326
You're hurting my hand!

1009
01:14:34.453 --> 01:14:35.989
Get off me!

1010
01:14:37.856 --> 01:14:40.166
I'm innocent!
Those panties aren't mine!


1011
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:46.041
You're squeezing too hard!

1012
01:14:53.372 --> 01:14:55.511
No one scorches me
without getting burned,


1013
01:14:55.641 --> 01:14:57.177
you get it, cocksucker?

1014
01:14:57.309 --> 01:14:58.515
You're the one who double-crossed me!

1015
01:14:58.644 --> 01:14:59.952
And you stole my woman!

1016
01:15:00.045 --> 01:15:01.854
I didn't steal anybody.
That woman is not into you.


1017
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.893
She is not into you either!
She was just using you while doing her time!


1018
01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:07.030
Jackass... that woman was
just after your money.


1019
01:15:07.219 --> 01:15:09.893
- We'll see whose money she's after.
- She's my woman.


1020
01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.397
Your woman!

1021
01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:13.562
Keep jerking off to that!

1022
01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.405
You just keep doing it!

1023
01:15:15.494 --> 01:15:17.804
We'll see if she
visits you in hell now.

1024
01:15:17.996 --> 01:15:19.066
Stop being bitter.

1025
01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:22.245
Bitter? I'll show you what
bitter is when I get my hands on you...


1026
01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:26.075
We'll bump in there and I'm going
to crack your skull and stitch you up.


1027
01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:27.582
You dig, cocksucker?

1028
01:15:28.006 --> 01:15:30.816
- Do whatever you want.
- Whatever?


1029
01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:32.249
You're fucked,
son of a bitch!


1030
01:15:32.344 --> 01:15:33.584
You're so fucked!

1031
01:15:33.846 --> 01:15:37.089
- Quiet, inmate!
- Leave me the fuck alone!


1032
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.156
Let's go.

1033
01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.427
You're going to pay.

1034
01:16:19.324 --> 01:16:21.304
- Fuck! Fucking hell!
- Yanelly...


1035
01:16:21.426 --> 01:16:23.804
That asshole lied
to me in my face!


1036
01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:25.403
I never learn!

1037
01:16:25.597 --> 01:16:28.305
Haven't I learned anything?
I can't trust anyone?!


1038
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.073
- You just can't trust anyone!
- Calm down.


1039
01:16:32.337 --> 01:16:33.577
Yanelly, calm down.

1040
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.150
Whose panties were those?

1041
01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:41.415
- Don't know.
- Those panties belong to an inmate!


1042
01:16:41.513 --> 01:16:43.288
- Whose panties were those?!
- I don't know.


1043
01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:45.487
You know it!
You know it, right?!


1044
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:48.832
I'm going to kill that whore!
She is going down too!


1045
01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.659
Shut up.
Quit saying so much bullshit.


1046
01:16:50.956 --> 01:16:52.993
Shut up and calm down.
You're almost out of here.


1047
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.001
You're right, I'm getting out,
then I'll kill him...


1048
01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.141
...and I'm going to kill her too!

1049
01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.448
Make a line!
Move!


1050
01:17:09.808 --> 01:17:11.947
- Keep moving!
- Let's go.


1051
01:17:14.246 --> 01:17:15.884
Hurry up!

1052
01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:23.891
Check these guys now.

1053
01:17:24.089 --> 01:17:26.899
Get over there!
Spread your legs!


1054
01:17:28.594 --> 01:17:30.471
Okay, go, go!
Hurry up!


1055
01:17:30.996 --> 01:17:33.567
This way!
Go, go.


1056
01:17:33.999 --> 01:17:36.138
- Move!
- Keep moving!


1057
01:17:37.836 --> 01:17:40.077
- Stop right there!
- Make a line!


1058
01:17:40.272 --> 01:17:41.580
Make a line!
Quick!


1059
01:17:42.174 --> 01:17:46.145
- OK, keep moving now.
- Keep moving! This way!


1060
01:17:46.345 --> 01:17:48.256
Make a line!

1061
01:17:48.447 --> 01:17:51.985
You're not a good listener, ah?
Boy, are you gonna have it rough here!


1062
01:17:52.451 --> 01:17:54.590
You guys don't seem in a hurry...

1063
01:17:56.521 --> 01:17:58.501
Keep moving.
Why are you looking back?


1064
01:18:03.195 --> 01:18:04.435
Keep moving!

1065
01:18:07.032 --> 01:18:08.340
Come on!

1066
01:18:09.234 --> 01:18:10.770
Move it!
This way!


1067
01:18:12.804 --> 01:18:14.044
In you go.

1068
01:18:14.239 --> 01:18:15.445
Good afternoon, inmates.

1069
01:18:16.308 --> 01:18:18.379
I'm "Bighands" and
I'm in charge this joint,


1070
01:18:18.577 --> 01:18:21.558
where you get processed
for the first time.


1071
01:18:21.813 --> 01:18:24.555
Either as a new prisoner
or a transfer.


1072
01:18:25.083 --> 01:18:27.962
I can see right
away you need a haircut.

1073
01:18:28.153 --> 01:18:29.291
Go ahead, I dare you.

1074
01:18:29.488 --> 01:18:33.231
Don't worry. We'll take care of that
as soon as the guards leave.


1075
01:18:33.592 --> 01:18:35.799
Order and respect is what we want here.

1076
01:18:36.161 --> 01:18:37.401
Thanks, "Bighands".

1077
01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:43.403
Who is Julian Sosa?

1078
01:18:45.103 --> 01:18:46.081
I am.

1079
01:18:47.272 --> 01:18:48.580
And Rogelio Encarnacion?

1080
01:18:49.007 --> 01:18:50.247
Me. They call me Manaury.

1081
01:18:50.842 --> 01:18:53.083
So you're the lovebirds
who can't be together.


1082
01:18:53.612 --> 01:18:55.148
OK, let's figure this out right away.

1083
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.918
You, to "Los Arpones".

1084
01:18:58.483 --> 01:19:00.190
You, 1 and 2 in Vietnam.

1085
01:19:01.019 --> 01:19:03.431
These two to the Corridors.

1086
01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:05.433
And you are going with him.

1087
01:19:06.191 --> 01:19:07.431
Let's go.

1088
01:19:07.526 --> 01:19:09.130
You're going to pay for this, cocksucker!

1089
01:19:09.294 --> 01:19:12.434
- Shut up!
- You're gonna get it, damn pokemon!


1090
01:19:14.466 --> 01:19:17.106
We'll bump into each other, motherfucker!

1091
01:19:17.302 --> 01:19:18.940
Shut it!
Let's go!


1092
01:19:23.909 --> 01:19:25.786
What's with you?!
What's it going to be?!


1093
01:19:53.939 --> 01:19:55.418
Enough! Leave him alone!

1094
01:19:57.943 --> 01:20:00.082
Leave him alone now!

1095
01:20:48.894 --> 01:20:50.305
It's a "blonde"!

1096
01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:57.142
It's "blondie"!

1097
01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:22.833
Welcome to Vietnam, man.

1098
01:21:24.362 --> 01:21:27.002
So... shall we shave the rooster?!

1099
01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:29.110
Yes!

1100
01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:31.106
Stop it, motherfucker!

1101
01:21:31.536 --> 01:21:33.345
Make some noise
if you want him shaven!


1102
01:21:33.538 --> 01:21:35.108
Yeah!

1103
01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:37.010
We're shaving his head!

1104
01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:39.622
Out with the hair!

1105
01:21:39.945 --> 01:21:41.925
Out with the hair!

1106
01:21:43.048 --> 01:21:44.618
I'm going to kill you,
you fucking rat!


1107
01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:47.293
Shut up and come here!

1108
01:21:48.053 --> 01:21:49.532
Fuck!

1109
01:21:50.388 --> 01:21:51.628
"I'm a warrior..."

1110
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:53.867
"Aggressive for the living
and living for the aggressive."


1111
01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:55.972
"That's how you survive
in this world I live in."


1112
01:21:56.061 --> 01:21:58.371
"I firmly step on
wherever I may go."


1113
01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.374
"Nothing you can say
will change who I am."


1114
01:22:00.565 --> 01:22:04.536
"Everybody has to die,
the Lord say it so."


1115
01:22:07.239 --> 01:22:09.150
"The barrel is ready
for the first shot."


1116
01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.582
"The one who gets it
will be erased."


1117
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.123
So it was this bitch!

1118
01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:51.186
That's how I wanted to find you!

1119
01:22:51.483 --> 01:22:53.360
So the yellow panties were yours!

1120
01:22:53.985 --> 01:22:56.522
Manaury is my boyfriend,
like it or not!


1121
01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:58.625
Is this what you were looking for?

1122
01:23:01.459 --> 01:23:02.437
Oh no...

1123
01:23:02.894 --> 01:23:06.034
That's not really
what I was looking for.


1124
01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.572
- This is how it's going to be?
- That's it.


1125
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:12.003
Well, go ahead, slash me!
Don't you have "balls"?


1126
01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:13.513
- I have no balls.
- Come on, cut me!


1127
01:23:13.838 --> 01:23:15.146
I have ovaries.

1128
01:23:15.507 --> 01:23:18.078
Besides, your bark must be worse
than your bite, bitch.


1129
01:23:18.443 --> 01:23:20.081
Don't leave, come back.

1130
01:23:20.445 --> 01:23:22.925
Come back, you bitch!

1131
01:23:23.114 --> 01:23:25.094
You fucking asshole!

1132
01:23:43.168 --> 01:23:44.977
So you got your hair cut.

1133
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:48.612
- Nice haircut-
- Get off, cocksucker!


1134
01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.280
You're too aggressive.

1135
01:23:50.642 --> 01:23:52.849
You know you gotta pony up
your "association fee".


1136
01:23:53.044 --> 01:23:54.523
I'm here, come and claim it!

1137
01:23:54.646 --> 01:23:56.853
I will. What's in that bag?

1138
01:23:57.048 --> 01:23:58.118
My clothes, what gives?

1139
01:23:58.316 --> 01:23:59.386
That's something...

1140
01:23:59.985 --> 01:24:01.464
That should do it for now.

1141
01:24:01.553 --> 01:24:03.032
You'll have to kill me before I...

1142
01:24:03.154 --> 01:24:04.963
He hasn't killed you
'cause you're lucky cocksucker!


1143
01:24:05.156 --> 01:24:06.294
What's it going to be, asshole?!

1144
01:24:06.391 --> 01:24:08.598
Just 'cause you're new you think
you can step all over us...


1145
01:24:08.893 --> 01:24:09.963
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

1146
01:24:10.095 --> 01:24:11.574
- What's the matter?
Is he your boyfriend?


1147
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:13.901
- He is.
- Tell him to cough up the dough!


1148
01:24:14.099 --> 01:24:15.305
Or he is going down!

1149
01:24:15.433 --> 01:24:16.969
I'm not, you asshole, can you hear!

1150
01:24:17.102 --> 01:24:18.809
Asshole? That's what I'll pull out
of your mouth, you cocksucker!


1151
01:24:18.937 --> 01:24:21.247
I've been here way longer than you!

1152
01:24:21.339 --> 01:24:24.582
- That's enough!
- Calm the fuck down, you asshole!


1153
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:26.145
Hey, what's up?

1154
01:24:27.278 --> 01:24:29.918
So you finally ended up in "La Victoria",
asshole. Move it.


1155
01:24:33.284 --> 01:24:35.230
You sleep on that side
and I sleep on this side.


1156
01:24:36.021 --> 01:24:38.001
I should've let them crush you
out there...


1157
01:24:38.456 --> 01:24:39.958
for being such a dickhead with me.

1158
01:24:40.191 --> 01:24:42.671
'Cause of cousins like you
I ended up in this hole all fucked.


1159
01:24:43.628 --> 01:24:46.040
It's cost me a lot,
but I got some respect around here..


1160
01:24:47.866 --> 01:24:49.174
Now that we're talking...

1161
01:24:50.468 --> 01:24:55.008
We're not. This is off-limits.
Unless there's an emergency.


1162
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:59.282
OK, whatever.
How do I cross over to Vietnam?


1163
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:01.847
That's impossible, we're separated.

1164
01:25:02.147 --> 01:25:03.285
So there is no way?

1165
01:25:04.049 --> 01:25:05.858
Unless you get sick,

1166
01:25:06.051 --> 01:25:08.122
and I mean really sick
so they'll let you into the ER.


1167
01:25:08.219 --> 01:25:11.462
Manaury, leave your personal problems
out of prison.


1168
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:14.027
The thing is, that "problem"
is also in prison.


1169
01:25:28.606 --> 01:25:31.086
Julian. Julian!
Help me!


1170
01:25:31.943 --> 01:25:33.251
Help me, Julian!

1171
01:25:33.344 --> 01:25:35.984
This is the last chance to pay
your fucking dues!


1172
01:25:40.118 --> 01:25:41.153
Let him go.

1173
01:25:42.454 --> 01:25:45.162
What you mean, bro?
This fish owes us money!


1174
01:25:45.523 --> 01:25:47.002
Let him go, I said!

1175
01:25:48.026 --> 01:25:49.437
Alright, easy bro.

1176
01:25:50.028 --> 01:25:51.132
Of course I'll let him go.

1177
01:25:53.531 --> 01:25:55.943
So... you want us to let him go?

1178
01:25:56.301 --> 01:25:59.009
- Are you going to pay for him...?
- Hey! Hey!


1179
01:25:59.137 --> 01:26:00.343
What the fuck are you doing?!

1180
01:26:00.538 --> 01:26:02.017
What the fuck is going on here?!

1181
01:26:02.874 --> 01:26:06.185
This asshole here is interrupting
our job, Cuba.


1182
01:26:06.311 --> 01:26:08.348
So you want to kill them both, huh?!

1183
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.982
So they can come and search us all?!

1184
01:26:10.148 --> 01:26:13.129
Take it easy, Cuba.
You're the boss here.


1185
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:14.059
Get out. Move it.

1186
01:26:14.152 --> 01:26:15.460
- Go, go, go.
- He saved your ass, asshole.


1187
01:26:15.587 --> 01:26:17.464
Get out now!
You too, out!


1188
01:26:17.989 --> 01:26:19.127
Easy, Cuba.

1189
01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:24.964
So, what happened here?

1190
01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:26.799
I'm alright, but he's not.

1191
01:26:29.501 --> 01:26:31.310
I'm the one in charge here.

1192
01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:34.413
If anything happens,
I get all the heat.


1193
01:26:34.939 --> 01:26:36.077
One more thing.

1194
01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:38.478
If you don't have any money
to pay those thugs...


1195
01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:41.257
...you need to find
a way to make some!


1196
01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:43.991
You got good hands?

1197
01:26:45.016 --> 01:26:46.086
Yeah.

1198
01:26:46.351 --> 01:26:47.887
Well, we'll put them to work then.

1199
01:26:48.186 --> 01:26:49.927
Alright. But what about him?

1200
01:26:53.124 --> 01:26:54.102
Hey!

1201
01:26:54.192 --> 01:26:55.262
Thank you.

1202
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.495
Come on, come here!

1203
01:27:03.368 --> 01:27:05.109
...so I opened fire on him.

1204
01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:07.281
- How many times did you shoot him?
- No idea.


1205
01:28:01.626 --> 01:28:03.606
Quiet!
Easy, easy!


1206
01:28:11.970 --> 01:28:13.244
Over there.
Over there everyone.


1207
01:28:13.404 --> 01:28:14.815
Everyone over there.

1208
01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.480
There.

1209
01:28:18.576 --> 01:28:20.385
Over there, man.
Get in line.


1210
01:29:21.973 --> 01:29:24.385
That woman is gone, dude.
No signals of life.


1211
01:29:25.076 --> 01:29:26.885
God... damn it.

1212
01:29:27.578 --> 01:29:30.115
But I got you her address
with a friend of mine.


1213
01:29:30.248 --> 01:29:32.455
She's from Haina, Framboyan.

1214
01:29:32.583 --> 01:29:35.223
Go find a priest called "Machete".

1215
01:29:35.386 --> 01:29:37.525
He can connect you
with whoever you want.


1216
01:29:37.989 --> 01:29:39.468
Alright. I can work with that.

1217
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:40.967
Take care.

1218
01:29:46.164 --> 01:29:48.144
Hallelujah!
Thank God!


1219
01:30:00.278 --> 01:30:01.313
Alright

1220
01:30:01.946 --> 01:30:04.927
I can do all of that from here.

1221
01:30:06.517 --> 01:30:08.087
Signed, your woodpecker.

1222
01:30:10.021 --> 01:30:11.500
And write the address too.

1223
01:30:13.858 --> 01:30:15.098
Ready.

1224
01:30:19.464 --> 01:30:20.943
Thank you.

1225
01:30:21.299 --> 01:30:23.836
Can I borrow those pliers?

1226
01:30:24.302 --> 01:30:25.280
Sure.

1227
01:30:27.872 --> 01:30:29.852
- Here you go.
- Thanks.


1228
01:30:30.041 --> 01:30:32.021
Close the door behind you.

1229
01:31:11.516 --> 01:31:13.996
About this... you can
be sure she'll get it.


1230
01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.622
Whether she'll come to visit
or not, only God knows.


1231
01:31:17.855 --> 01:31:19.425
What about the other thing?

1232
01:31:19.524 --> 01:31:22.266
Don't worry. I've been
doing it for ten years.


1233
01:31:23.127 --> 01:31:24.606
I just want her
to get that letter today.


1234
01:31:25.963 --> 01:31:27.033
You know tomorrow's the day.

1235
01:31:27.632 --> 01:31:28.838
She'll get it.

1236
01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:54.028
Fuck!

1237
01:32:07.572 --> 01:32:08.642
Let's see...

1238
01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:10.984
Let me measure this...

1239
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:14.421
We'll use this for a tight fit.

1240
01:32:16.347 --> 01:32:17.325
OK...

1241
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.060
Doctor, we have an emergency!

1242
01:32:26.357 --> 01:32:27.495
What happened to him?

1243
01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:28.937
He burnt his leg.

1244
01:32:29.193 --> 01:32:30.001
Burnt?

1245
01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:31.163
What's your name?

1246
01:32:31.362 --> 01:32:32.340
Manaury!

1247
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:33.600
Nicolas, please...

1248
01:32:34.031 --> 01:32:36.238
Bring me some betadine,
saline solution and gauze.


1249
01:32:37.368 --> 01:32:38.346
I'm removing your shoe.

1250
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:40.440
Be careful, slow!

1251
01:32:48.312 --> 01:32:49.290
Como on, keep going.

1252
01:32:51.315 --> 01:32:53.124
There was a time
in the countryside...


1253
01:32:54.218 --> 01:32:57.290
...when people used a stick
tied to a tube...


1254
01:32:57.688 --> 01:32:59.326
...with a nail on it.

1255
01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:01.197
And with that,
they will strike the oxen.


1256
01:33:01.392 --> 01:33:04.134
That's a sting.
A thorn in the flesh.


1257
01:33:04.328 --> 01:33:06.638
Something that wounds you,
something that frightens you.


1258
01:33:07.565 --> 01:33:10.569
Paul is telling to Death,
"you can't sting me anymore!"


1259
01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:13.073
"Death, you're no longer
a threat to me!"


1260
01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:15.916
Why? Because someone
died at the cross for me"...


1261
01:33:16.107 --> 01:33:18.917
...so Death has no grip on my life!

1262
01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:22.821
And we will be transformed,
and in that transformation...


1263
01:33:23.447 --> 01:33:25.427
...there will be a death-like moment.

1264
01:33:25.616 --> 01:33:26.993
Because God has to finish you...

1265
01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:28.994
...so you may come into
the Kingdom of Heaven.


1266
01:33:29.353 --> 01:33:32.095
It's death to the flesh,
death to the mundane.


1267
01:33:32.623 --> 01:33:35.001
Because flesh and blood
cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.


1268
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.904
He's right, dammit!
Here we are like tamed bulls.


1269
01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:41.408
They prick us and lock us.
They keep us eating shit.


1270
01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:46.504
And death is right in here with us. The only
thing left to do is to rise up and tight them.


1271
01:33:46.671 --> 01:33:50.950
Use the nails pinned in our backs
and use them as a weapon against them.


1272
01:33:50.975 --> 01:33:54.445
Grab something and get ready.
We had enough of this!


1273
01:33:54.612 --> 01:33:59.083
God is with us. We will enter the
Kingdom of heaven, whatever it takes.


1274
01:33:59.317 --> 01:34:02.093
Hell is going to break loose.
There's no turning back!


1275
01:35:04.548 --> 01:35:05.618
What's wrong?

1276
01:35:06.651 --> 01:35:08.460
Stay close to me.
Somethings going on.


1277
01:35:09.487 --> 01:35:10.795
What?

1278
01:35:11.989 --> 01:35:12.967
Get behind me!

1279
01:35:24.168 --> 01:35:25.146
Run!

1280
01:35:40.451 --> 01:35:41.429
What are you doing?

1281
01:35:43.454 --> 01:35:44.592
Oh, it's you.

1282
01:35:45.523 --> 01:35:47.002
What are you going to do with that?

1283
01:35:47.358 --> 01:35:49.099
I have to take care of something.

1284
01:35:50.461 --> 01:35:51.439
Manaury...

1285
01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:53.968
We inmates
outnumber the guards.


1286
01:35:54.198 --> 01:35:56.940
If we could just go riot
we can break out of the goddamn prison.


1287
01:35:57.468 --> 01:35:59.505
That's cool, but first my business,
then we'll talk.


1288
01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:01.349
Let it go. It's not worth it!

1289
01:36:01.872 --> 01:36:04.443
What's wrong with you?
I told you my business first!


1290
01:36:06.544 --> 01:36:07.614
I won't let you do it.

1291
01:36:10.915 --> 01:36:12.121
You and how many girls?

1292
01:36:13.484 --> 01:36:14.963
Julian saved my ass big time, dude.

1293
01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.890
Oh, he saved you...

1294
01:36:19.824 --> 01:36:21.394
Let him save you from this, asshole!

1295
01:36:22.993 --> 01:36:24.973
You're going to pay for this!

1296
01:36:54.525 --> 01:36:55.595
Put it on me.

1297
01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:46.319
Come! There's no time!

1298
01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:54.327
For God's sake, where were you?

1299
01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:57.258
- Sorry we're late.
- Come here, this is the guy.


1300
01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.601
- ID.
- Here.


1301
01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:06.267
Your ID.

1302
01:38:07.031 --> 01:38:08.169
I did get it, see?

1303
01:38:11.902 --> 01:38:13.540
- Sign here.
- Thanks.


1304
01:38:16.574 --> 01:38:17.552
Sign here.

1305
01:38:22.913 --> 01:38:25.223
Your ID, and his.

1306
01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:32.957
By the power vested upon me by law,
I pronounce you man and wife.


1307
01:38:33.157 --> 01:38:35.398
You may pick up
your certificate in two days.


1308
01:38:35.926 --> 01:38:39.066
You may kiss the bride.

1309
01:38:41.932 --> 01:38:44.310
That's how I wanted to find you!

1310
01:38:45.836 --> 01:38:46.974
Manaury, put the gun down!

1311
01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:48.809
Shut up, you fucking bitch!

1312
01:38:49.273 --> 01:38:50.513
Don't talk to her like that!

1313
01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:53.250
Then show me how to talk to her!

1314
01:38:54.445 --> 01:38:56.447
- This is the house of the Lord!
- Back off! Back off!


1315
01:38:56.847 --> 01:38:58.190
- Respect the house of God.
- Back off!


1316
01:38:58.516 --> 01:38:59.494
Back off!

1317
01:39:00.417 --> 01:39:01.395
Back off!

1318
01:39:03.454 --> 01:39:05.229
Stop right there, you son of a bitch!

1319
01:39:07.024 --> 01:39:08.833
Stop right there, motherfucker!

1320
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:28.221
Stop right there, both of you,
or I'll shoot you!


1321
01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.457
Manaury, put the gun down...

1322
01:39:31.982 --> 01:39:33.120
Calm down, Manaury!

1323
01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:35.389
- Shut up, you bitch!
- Calm down!


1324
01:39:35.586 --> 01:39:36.564
Put the gun down!

1325
01:39:36.987 --> 01:39:38.057
Out of my way!

1326
01:40:15.292 --> 01:40:16.270
What now?

1327
01:40:19.296 --> 01:40:21.242
Do you think you can have
whatever you want...


1328
01:40:21.432 --> 01:40:23.070
...whenever you want it?

1329
01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:24.938
I told to shut the fuck up!
This is not your problem!


1330
01:40:25.035 --> 01:40:27.515
This is not his problem,
it's my problem!


1331
01:40:27.972 --> 01:40:29.178
She already made a choice.

1332
01:40:29.473 --> 01:40:30.850
Well, so did I.

1333
01:40:34.211 --> 01:40:36.122
Yanelly, you need to go.

1334
01:40:36.647 --> 01:40:37.955
What about you?

1335
01:40:38.315 --> 01:40:40.226
Wait for me outside.
Get out of the tunnels.


1336
01:40:41.552 --> 01:40:42.963
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


1337
01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:46.360
Cover your face with this.
Do it!


1338
01:40:51.495 --> 01:40:52.974
It's only you and me now.

1339
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:54.470
Go on, shoot.

1340
01:41:02.406 --> 01:41:03.544
Come on, shoot!

1341
01:41:32.302 --> 01:41:33.440
Julian?!

1342
01:41:40.978 --> 01:41:42.116
Julian!

1343
01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:44.357
You're going to be fine.

1344
01:41:45.315 --> 01:41:46.623
We're going to make it.

1345
01:41:48.886 --> 01:41:51.526
We're going to make it out of this.
But you have to hold on!


1346
01:41:54.158 --> 01:41:57.037
"Did... I... steal you?"

1347
01:41:59.229 --> 01:42:02.301
"Yes you did, I'm all yours"

1348
01:42:03.333 --> 01:42:05.870
"Pure, pure, pure"

1349
01:42:09.339 --> 01:42:10.477
Yes!

1350
01:42:12.509 --> 01:42:13.817
Can you move?

1351
01:42:14.511 --> 01:42:15.819
Julian?!
