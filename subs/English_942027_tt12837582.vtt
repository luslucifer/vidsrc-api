1
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.935
- Having fun, sweetie?
- Yeah.


2
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.815
<i>At the time,
it seemed like our story was predictable,</i>


3
00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:51.786
<i>calm... safe.</i>

4
00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:57.424
And here
at Paragon Council Industries,


5
00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:02.864
as the worldwide leader
in biomedical sciences,


6
00:03:02.897 --> 00:03:06.500
we are proudly developing
a sustainable treatment regimen


7
00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:10.404
that's been producing
incredible results.


8
00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:13.742
Combating debilitating fear
in individuals.


9
00:03:15.744 --> 00:03:18.580
You all being here
means a lot to us.


10
00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:22.382
We are aware of how much
of a commitment this will be.


11
00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:25.854
However, please know that
I'm equally committed to you


12
00:03:25.887 --> 00:03:26.955
and your treatment.

13
00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:29.824
This place
is the ideal environment for us


14
00:03:29.858 --> 00:03:31.793
to take a very deep dive
into your conditions.


15
00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:34.662
You're in good hands.

16
00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:37.431
I think you will all be pleased
with the results.


17
00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.466
You sound very certain
of yourself.


18
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.500
I am.

19
00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:43.905
Let's for a moment
try to imagine a scenario


20
00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:45.472
where you no longer
have to suffer.


21
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:51.478
That is the beautiful reality
I'd like to expose you all to.


22
00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:53.323
And I look forward to getting
to know each of you


23
00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:55.482
- over the coming weeks.
- Well, wonderful.


24
00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:57.919
If you'd all kindly follow me.

25
00:03:57.952 --> 00:03:59.921
Let's take a tour.

26
00:03:59.954 --> 00:04:01.388
Welcome to PCI.

27
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.692
Don't even ask.

28
00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:39.493
I wasn't goin' to.

29
00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:42.429
Good, because you know
what the answer would be, Bob.


30
00:04:42.462 --> 00:04:43.932
We're not meeting on dry land,

31
00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:45.743
because I don't wanna be
in the company of those


32
00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:48.136
who seek solid ground
beneath them.


33
00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.671
I know.

34
00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:51.371
Good. They're beneath me.

35
00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:58.046
So what's up?

36
00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.914
How's everything in my company,
Bob?


37
00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:03.685
Everything's okay.

38
00:05:03.718 --> 00:05:06.154
New batch starting today?

39
00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:07.589
Yes.

40
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:15.163
What?

41
00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:17.899
The new guy, Meredith hired.

42
00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:19.868
I don't know.

43
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.604
You don't know what, Bob?

44
00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:24.572
I heard him rehearsing
his lines.


45
00:05:24.606 --> 00:05:26.975
It... it's not good.

46
00:05:27.008 --> 00:05:31.079
Oh, rehearsing his lines.

47
00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:32.881
Well, Meredith hired him.

48
00:05:32.914 --> 00:05:35.149
He has no tact.

49
00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:36.784
She's your right hand.

50
00:05:36.818 --> 00:05:37.685
I don't know
what to tell you, Bob.


51
00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.020
This guy...

52
00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:40.613
I don't wanna hear this,
tell it to her.


53
00:05:44.192 --> 00:05:45.894
Okay. Full report.

54
00:05:45.927 --> 00:05:49.097
Two males, two females,
as requested.


55
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.798
Uh, cleared 100%.

56
00:05:50.832 --> 00:05:52.934
They're at their orientation
as we speak.


57
00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:54.102
Excellent.

58
00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:55.770
And they met all
the requirements?


59
00:05:55.803 --> 00:05:59.741
They all have extreme cases
of thanataphobia.


60
00:05:59.774 --> 00:06:01.776
Let's hope the rest
of the world does, too.


61
00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:03.211
Cheers to job security.

62
00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:22.030
What was the name
of your childhood pet?


63
00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.000
Spork.

64
00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:37.111
I don't make the rules.

65
00:06:37.145 --> 00:06:38.646
Next!

66
00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:47.689
Yeah, I'm just concerned.

67
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.526
Good.

68
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.771
Look, Vivian's right there
with him.


69
00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:56.698
She's solid.

70
00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:59.000
Careful.

71
00:06:59.033 --> 00:07:01.869
So you've all had an opportunity
to see our operation


72
00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:03.137
and meet with key staff and...

73
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:04.005
May I ask?

74
00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:05.707
The nametags.

75
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.151
You said you wanted to get
to know us,


76
00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:08.876
but I don't see
how calling us by...


77
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.914
I realize that this seems
a bit unorthodox,


78
00:07:12.947 --> 00:07:15.249
but it is all with intent.

79
00:07:15.283 --> 00:07:17.484
There is a reason for everything
that we do here.


80
00:07:19.087 --> 00:07:22.724
Your conditions are extreme.

81
00:07:22.757 --> 00:07:24.125
And thus, to a degree,

82
00:07:24.158 --> 00:07:26.928
our treatment methods
follow suit.


83
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:31.632
Now, there are a few other,
perhaps, unnerving elements


84
00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:33.634
of your stay here.

85
00:07:33.668 --> 00:07:36.204
Until further notice,
you all will be wearing


86
00:07:36.237 --> 00:07:38.873
specially-fitted suits.

87
00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:40.775
They will cover you from
head to toe


88
00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:43.211
and will be worn at all times.

89
00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:46.748
They are tamper-resistant,
only we can remove them,


90
00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:49.317
and we will do so at
the appropriate time.


91
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:54.122
How are... how are we supposed
to take a shower or a...


92
00:07:54.155 --> 00:07:55.857
Uh, here you are about to enter

93
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.226
is one of the cleanest
environments in the world.


94
00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:01.996
Um, I don't consider
that an answer.


95
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.631
What about, when we gotta go?

96
00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:07.035
Any and all procedures
will be explained.


97
00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:11.715
I should have asked you
to record it for me.


98
00:08:11.739 --> 00:08:13.641
I feel like I'm missin' out.

99
00:08:13.674 --> 00:08:15.243
Yeah.

100
00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:17.779
I told you
when I came up with it, right?


101
00:08:17.812 --> 00:08:19.347
Yeah.

102
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.250
I'm sittin' there on the throne,
just pops in my head.


103
00:08:22.283 --> 00:08:24.118
Sittin' there laughing
hysterically, Bob.


104
00:08:24.152 --> 00:08:26.187
Had to be for ten minutes.
I'm laughin' my ass off.


105
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.056
I'm glad this is all so amusing.

106
00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:31.059
Well, it is.

107
00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:37.031
I'm the one
that's gonna watch it.


108
00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:40.034
De-familiarization stage, Bob.

109
00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:45.640
It's so funny to me.

110
00:08:45.673 --> 00:08:48.009
Stupid, but fun.

111
00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:53.047
One more item I'd like to share.

112
00:08:54.849 --> 00:08:56.818
There will be
no reflective surfaces


113
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:59.153
anywhere in the environment.

114
00:08:59.187 --> 00:09:00.822
Until further notice,

115
00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:02.623
you will no longer be able
to see yourselves.


116
00:09:04.158 --> 00:09:06.861
Without going into detail,

117
00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:09.864
a separation
from your familiar selves,


118
00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:12.934
at this crucial time,
plays a vital role


119
00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:15.636
in your therapy.

120
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.140
This is called
the "de-familiarization stage".


121
00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:22.810
It is important to remember
that all of this,


122
00:09:22.844 --> 00:09:27.782
everything that we do
is for your benefit.


123
00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:30.918
It's been a
long day for all of us.


124
00:09:30.952 --> 00:09:32.787
Get some rest.

125
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.722
We have a lot
of amazing work to do.


126
00:09:57.245 --> 00:10:01.682
<i>My parents met the
Lloyd's on vacation one year.</i>


127
00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:03.084
<i>I'm glad they did</i>

128
00:10:03.117 --> 00:10:05.753
<i>because Olivia
came into my life.</i>


129
00:10:07.455 --> 00:10:09.056
Hey, Jade, come on in.

130
00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:13.828
- Hi! Hi!
- Jadey, I missed you!


131
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:15.372
Hey, your school break
couldn't come at a better time.


132
00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:18.166
My God, I got so much goin' on
at my office.


133
00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:19.700
Wow!

134
00:10:19.734 --> 00:10:20.744
And you know,
how busy uh, Meredith is.


135
00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:22.103
It's just crazy.

136
00:10:22.136 --> 00:10:24.172
We're gonna have lots of fun,
bugger!


137
00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:25.873
Yeah.

138
00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:27.375
Cool.
Well, look, I know it's late.


139
00:10:27.408 --> 00:10:29.210
I am going to get ready
and head to my office.


140
00:10:29.243 --> 00:10:30.487
Try to get some work done
while it's quiet.


141
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:32.213
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm here.


142
00:10:32.246 --> 00:10:34.415
Good. The guestroom's all set.

143
00:10:34.448 --> 00:10:36.484
Uh, we got you a flatter pillow.

144
00:10:36.517 --> 00:10:38.786
Thank you, Mr. Lloyd,
and thank you, dear Olivia.


145
00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:40.188
Hey, and I you know,

146
00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:42.056
I don't know when Meredith
will be home.


147
00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:44.192
What can I say,
you are a lifesaver.


148
00:10:44.225 --> 00:10:46.227
- Give me a hug.
- Hmm.


149
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.728
- Goodnight, Mr. Lloyd.
- All right.


150
00:10:47.762 --> 00:10:49.230
And I won't let her stay up
too late.


151
00:10:49.263 --> 00:10:50.263
Don't worry.

152
00:11:50.258 --> 00:11:52.193
Hey, why're you here?

153
00:11:53.527 --> 00:11:55.162
It's late, my friend.

154
00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:56.330
Look at this list.

155
00:11:56.364 --> 00:11:59.100
All of them. Gone.

156
00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:00.410
You're acting like
I didn't tell you a month ago


157
00:12:00.434 --> 00:12:02.103
this would happen.

158
00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:04.038
- How is this not...
- Brady, relax.


159
00:12:07.074 --> 00:12:08.409
I got something
I wanna show you.


160
00:12:10.244 --> 00:12:12.079
Is that what I think it is?

161
00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:18.486
But first, Brady, may I say
that your daughter is a gem.


162
00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:19.487
Come on.

163
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.989
Olivia just adores her.

164
00:12:22.023 --> 00:12:24.425
All kidding aside,
you've done a wonderful job


165
00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:28.029
raising her all these years
yourself.


166
00:12:31.966 --> 00:12:33.100
It's almost done.

167
00:12:34.869 --> 00:12:37.805
Whatever happens here,
we'll be fine.


168
00:12:40.408 --> 00:12:41.976
Wait.

169
00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:43.544
Hidden in plain sight.

170
00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:44.578
Brilliant.

171
00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:50.484
But Myles,
you know how things are.


172
00:12:50.518 --> 00:12:53.387
Since, I mean,
artificial intelligence,


173
00:12:53.421 --> 00:12:55.189
it brought the world
to the brink.


174
00:12:55.222 --> 00:12:58.326
It's harmless.
They'll allow it.


175
00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:00.027
This is our ace in the hole.

176
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:36.263
Okay, time to get ready
for school.


177
00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:48.075
People, the time is now,
and you all know it.


178
00:13:48.109 --> 00:13:51.312
- Meredith.
- Bob.


179
00:13:51.345 --> 00:13:53.314
Everything is a go.

180
00:13:53.347 --> 00:13:55.483
There are people downstairs
right now.


181
00:13:55.516 --> 00:13:57.518
They are living proof.

182
00:13:57.552 --> 00:13:59.487
We've been at this same point
for what,


183
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.055
two months now?

184
00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:02.624
We've done it.

185
00:14:02.657 --> 00:14:05.159
We cracked the code.

186
00:14:05.192 --> 00:14:08.362
We found a cure
for death itself.


187
00:14:08.396 --> 00:14:11.499
Revolutionary doesn't even
begin to describe it.


188
00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:17.004
All we need now is for the vote
to be ratified by us.


189
00:14:17.037 --> 00:14:19.140
By you.

190
00:14:19.173 --> 00:14:23.544
All of you extremely important
individuals here in this room.


191
00:14:26.147 --> 00:14:29.618
Today your board actually voted?

192
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:32.420
You're playing God.

193
00:14:32.453 --> 00:14:35.557
You wanna talk about
playing God?


194
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.360
Your game, your kids' game.

195
00:14:39.393 --> 00:14:41.128
You're solely responsible
for putting


196
00:14:41.162 --> 00:14:43.364
every kids TV network,

197
00:14:43.397 --> 00:14:45.032
the entire industry,
out of business.


198
00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:47.034
No.

199
00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:50.037
It doesn't compare.

200
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.640
What I'm doing
is simple progress.


201
00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:53.207
And so am I.

202
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.240
You can't be serious.

203
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.947
Meredith,
hasn't PCI caused enough pain?


204
00:15:02.483 --> 00:15:03.994
This time around,
everything's just gonna go


205
00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:05.286
exactly as planned?

206
00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:09.190
You're gonna make people
live forever?


207
00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:12.460
Come on.

208
00:15:21.803 --> 00:15:26.440
So... how did Meredith
do this morning?


209
00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:30.244
Good, they're voting in favor
of the next round of trials.


210
00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:34.048
I put up a good front.

211
00:15:34.081 --> 00:15:35.550
Made us seem reluctant.

212
00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:38.185
I... I... I think you would have
been impressed.


213
00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:41.690
I am impressed, Bob.

214
00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:44.258
Not that I'm not actually
concerned about things,


215
00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:46.026
of course.

216
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.797
That's what I pay you for.

217
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.197
What else?

218
00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:54.468
We took off the suits.

219
00:15:54.502 --> 00:15:56.070
They saw their gray skin.

220
00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:04.144
Well, it's for the best.

221
00:16:04.178 --> 00:16:06.648
Why keep them in the dark
any longer than we need to?


222
00:16:35.877 --> 00:16:37.344
Soon.

223
00:16:37.378 --> 00:16:40.147
I've been hearing that
for months!


224
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.416
This wasn't part of the deal.

225
00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:43.752
I wanna get out of here!

226
00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:47.187
I hear you loud and clear.

227
00:16:49.891 --> 00:16:53.327
We're just asking
for a little more patience.


228
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.163
A little while longer
and you get to go home.


229
00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:01.268
And don't forget about
the compensation.


230
00:17:01.302 --> 00:17:03.370
It is a lot of money,

231
00:17:03.404 --> 00:17:05.272
and we all do really
appreciate that.


232
00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:10.444
But what about this?

233
00:17:10.477 --> 00:17:11.846
We're working on that.

234
00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:17.786
I'm goin' to the office.

235
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.119
Of course, you are.

236
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.492
The thing is uh,

237
00:17:25.526 --> 00:17:28.195
because we've kept them here
longer than we said,


238
00:17:28.228 --> 00:17:30.431
they're starting
to get restless.


239
00:17:30.464 --> 00:17:33.267
Oh, are they now?

240
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.569
They're anxious to leave.

241
00:17:36.403 --> 00:17:39.440
Bob, do me a favor,
and grab your phone.


242
00:17:39.473 --> 00:17:41.141
How many subjects,

243
00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:47.181
since day one, Bob,
how many have we paid?


244
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.653
Uh, uh, uh, I don't know.

245
00:17:51.686 --> 00:17:53.588
Yes, you do, Bob.

246
00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:55.356
You know precisely how many.

247
00:17:57.257 --> 00:18:00.260
Including this batch
of four uh, 41.


248
00:18:02.764 --> 00:18:03.865
Okay.

249
00:18:03.898 --> 00:18:06.400
Let's do some simple math here.

250
00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:08.311
What would you say
is the average amount of money


251
00:18:08.335 --> 00:18:10.537
we paid each subject?

252
00:18:10.572 --> 00:18:12.272
The average.

253
00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:14.241
Probably around a million.

254
00:18:15.644 --> 00:18:17.311
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

255
00:18:17.344 --> 00:18:18.813
Let me help with this one.

256
00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:22.651
The average negotiated price,
the going rate,


257
00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:24.919
has been 1.2 million.

258
00:18:24.953 --> 00:18:27.589
1.2.

259
00:18:27.622 --> 00:18:30.959
So multiply 41 times

260
00:18:30.992 --> 00:18:32.526
What you get, Bob?

261
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.433
49,200,000.

262
00:18:39.466 --> 00:18:42.570
Okay, good.
Now, divide that by four.


263
00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:51.813
12, 300,000.

264
00:18:51.846 --> 00:18:52.814
Good, good.

265
00:18:52.847 --> 00:18:55.984
Okay, so here's the deal.

266
00:18:56.017 --> 00:18:58.385
Because I have received
zero return


267
00:18:58.419 --> 00:19:00.220
on my investment so far,

268
00:19:00.254 --> 00:19:01.632
I'm into these current
four subjects


269
00:19:01.656 --> 00:19:05.492
for $12,300,000 each,

270
00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:06.728
Bob.

271
00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:07.761
Each!

272
00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:13.968
Do you really think I care
if they're getting restless?


273
00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:20.374
<i>Input object.</i>

274
00:19:27.015 --> 00:19:29.784
You lied!

275
00:19:29.818 --> 00:19:31.452
We've been over this, yes?

276
00:19:31.485 --> 00:19:33.988
But that's so wrong.

277
00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:35.557
You had no right.

278
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.891
You signed the papers.

279
00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:38.960
Oh, but that was more
of a textbook.


280
00:19:38.993 --> 00:19:40.995
You... you cannot have
expected us


281
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:42.564
to have read all that.

282
00:19:42.597 --> 00:19:46.568
That's exactly what we expected.

283
00:19:47.969 --> 00:19:50.939
You're cured of your fear now,
aren't you?


284
00:19:50.972 --> 00:19:53.373
Well, obviously.

285
00:19:53.407 --> 00:19:55.677
But I know what you were doing.

286
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.413
The nametags, and the suits,

287
00:19:59.446 --> 00:20:02.684
and... and not bein' able
to see ourselves,


288
00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:06.054
that wasn't part
of any fear therapy.


289
00:20:06.087 --> 00:20:08.823
That was just a big distraction.

290
00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:10.725
When you came here,

291
00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:14.328
you were at complete odds
with yourself, remember?


292
00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:15.897
The fear of death paralyzed you.

293
00:20:19.601 --> 00:20:22.003
You don't feel that way now.

294
00:20:22.036 --> 00:20:26.841
All you're feeling now is anger,
and maybe a bit of betrayal.


295
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:29.878
Those are two emotions
that dissipate,


296
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:31.512
clinically proven.

297
00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:35.550
And don't underestimate

298
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.452
the importance
of your role here.


299
00:20:38.485 --> 00:20:42.322
You and the others
will be revered.


300
00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:43.457
Is that all?

301
00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:05.914
- Boo!
- Oh!


302
00:21:05.947 --> 00:21:07.381
What are you doin' up?

303
00:21:07.414 --> 00:21:08.759
You need to get back to bed,
monster.


304
00:21:08.783 --> 00:21:10.417

Oh, she'll be fine.

I know I sound like
a broken record, but...


361
00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:32.967
Here it comes.

362
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.803
Well?

363
00:27:35.836 --> 00:27:40.775
I know, I just...
I'm contemplating, that's all.


364
00:27:40.808 --> 00:27:42.443
That's all?

365
00:27:42.476 --> 00:27:44.412
What is there to think about?

366
00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:46.047
It's amazing!

367
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.248
What we have now, this gift,

368
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:49.951
it's wonderful!

369
00:27:49.984 --> 00:27:51.085
Oh, you.

370
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.289
Sweetie, your name
is on the list.


371
00:27:57.291 --> 00:28:00.428
They'll call you soon,
you'll go down,


372
00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:02.029
you'll get your INOC.

373
00:28:02.063 --> 00:28:03.264
It's a little shot, in and out.

374
00:28:03.297 --> 00:28:04.999
I just... I...

375
00:28:05.032 --> 00:28:06.934
I don't know what I want,
I guess.


376
00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:09.403
Charlotte, what more could
you want?


377
00:28:09.437 --> 00:28:12.206
What?

378
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.943
You know, my mom never thought
this was a gift.


379
00:28:15.977 --> 00:28:18.980
- It seems unnatural to me.
- Maybe.


380
00:28:19.013 --> 00:28:21.782
Unnatural?

381
00:28:21.816 --> 00:28:23.951
What is more natural
than being here


382
00:28:23.985 --> 00:28:27.054
and happy with me, forever?

383
00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.226
And what about that daughter
you said you always wanted?


384
00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.194
I can still have a daughter.

385
00:28:33.227 --> 00:28:35.396
I know, sure,

386
00:28:35.429 --> 00:28:37.331
but she's just going to die
eventually


387
00:28:37.365 --> 00:28:40.201
and what is the sense in that?

388
00:28:40.234 --> 00:28:45.239
I mean... time was always
the problem.


389
00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:47.108
There simply wasn't enough of it

390
00:28:47.141 --> 00:28:49.277
to get the full experience,
that is.


391
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.946
And now?

392
00:28:51.979 --> 00:28:53.281
You never run out of it.

393
00:28:56.083 --> 00:28:57.418
<i>It was so surreal.</i>

394
00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:07.596
Looks like you have
goodies for me today, Bob.


395
00:29:07.629 --> 00:29:09.430
Yeah, there's a lot here.

396
00:29:15.303 --> 00:29:17.271
The pre-launch.

397
00:29:17.305 --> 00:29:18.873
Going well.

398
00:29:18.906 --> 00:29:20.575
The uh, pharmacies
are already setting up


399
00:29:20.609 --> 00:29:22.243
the health screenings.

400
00:29:22.276 --> 00:29:26.247
Uh-huh. And these pharmacies...

401
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.952
Legal has already vetted them
thoroughly.


402
00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.521
All signed off.

403
00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.292
They know
they'll lose their bonus.


404
00:29:38.326 --> 00:29:39.570
We're only working
with pharmacies


405
00:29:39.594 --> 00:29:41.395
that are struggling financially,

406
00:29:41.429 --> 00:29:43.598
just like you said to,
so I'm sure they'll...


407
00:29:43.632 --> 00:29:45.866
The power of money, Bob.

408
00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:51.905
Yeah.

409
00:30:01.182 --> 00:30:03.517
He
Wants to know if you're on the list.


410
00:30:03.552 --> 00:30:05.587
I am, but I'm not waiting.

411
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.088
I've been on the list too long.

412
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:13.060
Can you do it?

413
00:30:43.457 --> 00:30:45.159
Olivia.

414
00:30:45.192 --> 00:30:46.595
Your game.

415
00:30:46.628 --> 00:30:48.329
What did you do to make
that story?


416
00:30:48.362 --> 00:30:50.931
I didn't do anything.

417
00:30:50.965 --> 00:30:52.099
- Olivia.
- What?


418
00:30:52.133 --> 00:30:53.602
I didn't do anything.

419
00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:55.102
It's just not fun anymore.

420
00:30:55.136 --> 00:30:56.605
I don't wanna play it anymore.

421
00:30:59.373 --> 00:31:01.676
Well, you know what, bugger?

422
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.153
I don't feel like making
lunch anymore,


423
00:31:03.177 --> 00:31:05.112
how about that?

424
00:31:05.146 --> 00:31:06.146
Feel like going out?

425
00:31:07.749 --> 00:31:09.450
- What?
- Um...


426
00:31:09.483 --> 00:31:10.619
I'm on my way out.

427
00:31:10.652 --> 00:31:12.319
What?

428
00:31:12.353 --> 00:31:14.088
- They...
- They?


429
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.493
They said it isn't feasible.

430
00:31:19.527 --> 00:31:24.599
It is in fact, impossible,
as they see it.


431
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:29.336
We can figure out
how to live forever,


432
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.706
but we can't figure out
how to not have gray skin?


433
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.686
What is it?

434
00:31:44.719 --> 00:31:45.986
The gray.

435
00:31:50.692 --> 00:31:53.494
Look, I could figure
this shit out,


436
00:31:53.527 --> 00:31:56.163
but I'm not gonna do it,
I'm not goin' back in the lab.


437
00:31:58.432 --> 00:31:59.432
Did you know...

438
00:32:02.036 --> 00:32:04.104
after you cook a lobster,
if the meat is so gray,


439
00:32:04.138 --> 00:32:06.608
that means it's been dead
too long?


440
00:32:08.476 --> 00:32:10.077
No, I didn't.

441
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.213
You gotta read more books, Bob.

442
00:32:12.246 --> 00:32:14.014
Well, I don't really
have the time.


443
00:32:16.785 --> 00:32:18.219
Let me think about this.

444
00:32:20.054 --> 00:32:21.422
Let me think about this.

445
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.391
Let me think.

446
00:32:29.764 --> 00:32:32.099
I didn't know
you liked it that much.


447
00:32:32.132 --> 00:32:34.368
You're not the only one
allowed to have fun.


448
00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:35.770
My game isn't fun anymore.

449
00:32:35.804 --> 00:32:37.271
Yeah.

450
00:32:37.304 --> 00:32:39.473
Well, I'm gonna go upstairs
right now


451
00:32:39.507 --> 00:32:41.442
and fix it for you, okay?

452
00:32:41.475 --> 00:32:43.712
<i>I told Olivia that
I would fix her game.</i>


453
00:32:43.745 --> 00:32:46.648
<i>Truth is, I just hooked
the new game up in her room</i>


454
00:32:46.681 --> 00:32:48.750
<i>and I took hers.</i>

455
00:32:48.783 --> 00:32:50.552
<i>This way, she could
play her game and...</i>


456
00:32:50.585 --> 00:32:53.454
<i>And I could
keep watching the story.</i>


457
00:33:19.848 --> 00:33:22.149
<i>Hi, I'm Polly.</i>

458
00:33:22.182 --> 00:33:24.184
<i>What's our story gonna
be about today?</i>


459
00:33:24.218 --> 00:33:25.452
Olivia!

460
00:33:52.212 --> 00:33:55.449
- Did you talk to Amber?
- No.


461
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.530
They'll pick us up
off the ground one day, too.


462
00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:47.736
Okay, Ro, don't get yourself
all worked up.


463
00:34:53.575 --> 00:34:55.710
You're stupid.

464
00:34:55.744 --> 00:34:57.344
You're crazy.

465
00:34:57.378 --> 00:34:58.378
Yeah, that's like it.

466
00:35:03.417 --> 00:35:06.453
Gentlemen, please, careful.

467
00:35:08.556 --> 00:35:10.491
Right on the gurney
if you would please.


468
00:35:45.994 --> 00:35:47.796
I'm gonna make you look regal.

469
00:35:51.866 --> 00:35:54.535
Here we are.
This will do just fine.


470
00:35:57.271 --> 00:36:01.542
You are a dignified gentleman
and you will look as such.


471
00:36:08.282 --> 00:36:10.652
Fine gentleman,
I will be right with you.


472
00:36:37.444 --> 00:36:39.647
Please stop!

473
00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:41.983
- What are you doing?
- We need to dig up our boy.


474
00:36:42.016 --> 00:36:45.754
- What?
- We need to bring him back!


475
00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:47.254
Forgive me, what do you...

476
00:36:49.389 --> 00:36:53.728
Wait, I know you folks.

477
00:36:53.762 --> 00:36:56.463
I know you both!

478
00:36:56.497 --> 00:36:59.701
I provided the service
for your son some time ago.


479
00:36:59.734 --> 00:37:02.904
I'm... I'm sorry,
but what are you doing?


480
00:37:02.937 --> 00:37:04.537
We ca... they...
they can bring him back.


481
00:37:10.511 --> 00:37:13.313
I would help you dig

482
00:37:13.347 --> 00:37:15.449
if I thought it would help you
bring your son back.


483
00:37:15.482 --> 00:37:16.618
We miss him so much!

484
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:19.087
I know you do.

485
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.723
Why don't you come back
with me, dry off,


486
00:37:21.756 --> 00:37:24.759
and maybe have a drink
or something, okay?


487
00:37:51.518 --> 00:37:54.589
They wanted forever
with their son,


488
00:37:54.622 --> 00:37:56.591
but now they'll never have that.

489
00:38:01.428 --> 00:38:02.664
You see, my friend...

490
00:38:04.632 --> 00:38:06.668
I believe they would have,

491
00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:09.904
had they simply lived
their lives


492
00:38:09.938 --> 00:38:11.105
and died naturally.

493
00:38:12.807 --> 00:38:14.341
Like you.

494
00:38:16.778 --> 00:38:19.413
Now reunited
with your loved ones.


495
00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:29.423
Forever requires faith.

496
00:38:53.915 --> 00:38:55.382
I've seen you before.

497
00:38:57.051 --> 00:38:58.753
You get your papers
out of the dumpster.


498
00:39:01.923 --> 00:39:04.692
The whole world
is fallin' apart.


499
00:39:13.234 --> 00:39:14.669
That's for you.

500
00:39:14.702 --> 00:39:15.904
Thanks.

501
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:17.672
You poor thing.

502
00:39:17.705 --> 00:39:19.741
It's so sad.

503
00:39:22.509 --> 00:39:24.679
They give me the creeps.

504
00:39:24.712 --> 00:39:27.215
<i>The story went everywhere,</i>

505
00:39:27.248 --> 00:39:30.985
<i>all because of a few dolls
and Meredith's brochure.</i>


506
00:39:51.706 --> 00:39:52.941
Hello.

507
00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:56.711
Yes?

508
00:39:56.744 --> 00:39:58.646
See anything that tickles
your fancy?


509
00:40:00.081 --> 00:40:01.683
Anything but these.

510
00:40:03.584 --> 00:40:04.686
These are mine.

511
00:40:07.922 --> 00:40:09.456
Yes?

512
00:40:15.529 --> 00:40:16.529
Ah!

513
00:40:47.128 --> 00:40:49.297
- Mom?
- Charlotte.


514
00:40:54.569 --> 00:40:58.940
Sweetie... you can't.

515
00:41:00.808 --> 00:41:01.909
What?

516
00:41:05.146 --> 00:41:07.715
Accept what they call
their gift.


517
00:41:14.155 --> 00:41:15.923
I miss you, mom.

518
00:41:41.215 --> 00:41:43.584
There's my sunshine.

519
00:41:46.287 --> 00:41:50.725
Mmm, warm.

520
00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:52.727
Helps my brittle bones.

521
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:56.264
What do I do?

522
00:41:59.067 --> 00:42:04.038
When you make promises,
you're going to keep them.


523
00:42:09.143 --> 00:42:10.678
That's everything.

524
00:42:10.711 --> 00:42:12.380
Mom.

525
00:42:12.413 --> 00:42:14.148
My pretty girl.

526
00:42:17.652 --> 00:42:19.787
I love you so much.

527
00:42:59.961 --> 00:43:01.429
So,
when you're making these calls,


528
00:43:01.462 --> 00:43:05.233
it is very important
that you sound convincing.


529
00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:07.735
No need to set off any alarms.

530
00:43:07.768 --> 00:43:13.040
Just tell them that you know,
your treatment is going well,


531
00:43:13.074 --> 00:43:15.943
and that your trial's
been extended, and uh...


532
00:43:15.977 --> 00:43:22.950
and that uh, you'll be in touch
with them soon.


533
00:43:22.984 --> 00:43:24.285
What if they get suspicious?

534
00:43:24.318 --> 00:43:26.120
I know my family's worried.

535
00:43:26.154 --> 00:43:27.855
I wanna say this

536
00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:32.260
in the most sensitive
and delicate way possible.


537
00:43:32.293 --> 00:43:37.098
PCI cannot afford a scandal
or even a hint of impropriety.


538
00:43:37.131 --> 00:43:39.066
It simply will not do.

539
00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.068
It's in everyone's
best interests


540
00:43:41.102 --> 00:43:44.472
to keep your loved ones at bay
at this time.


541
00:43:44.505 --> 00:43:46.140
Whoa.

542
00:43:46.174 --> 00:43:48.242
That sounds like a threat.

543
00:43:48.276 --> 00:43:50.244
What can you do to me?

544
00:43:50.278 --> 00:43:52.947
You told me I can't die.

545
00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.284
There's nothing
that we can do to you.


546
00:43:56.317 --> 00:43:59.220
It's your loved ones
you should all be thinking of


547
00:43:59.253 --> 00:44:00.488
at this time.

548
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.925
What do you say
we make those calls?


549
00:44:17.972 --> 00:44:20.775
Hi kids, how're we doin'?

550
00:44:26.147 --> 00:44:28.115
You need to stop
pickin' up strangers.


551
00:44:36.558 --> 00:44:39.260
Hello.

552
00:44:39.293 --> 00:44:40.795
What's your name, young man?

553
00:44:42.363 --> 00:44:44.031
I'm Dr. Calvin.

554
00:44:48.302 --> 00:44:50.504
Would you like to come in?

555
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:55.409
It's okay.

556
00:45:04.318 --> 00:45:06.821
My name's Daniel.

557
00:45:06.854 --> 00:45:09.257
Okay, Daniel.

558
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.026
So, when did you get inoculated?

559
00:45:12.059 --> 00:45:14.395
They just stuck me here.

560
00:45:14.428 --> 00:45:16.931
Did you get inoculated
at a clinic?


561
00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:18.065
An actual INOC clinic?

562
00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:19.267
Ladies.

563
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.939
Hmm.

564
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:27.441
Okay, Daniel,
try to stay with me, okay?


565
00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:30.244
Lovely, lovely lady dragonflies,

566
00:45:30.278 --> 00:45:32.446
and they float around my head,

567
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.050
and they're all naked,
and none of them have heads.


568
00:45:37.586 --> 00:45:40.021
So, I still hear them talk...

569
00:45:42.456 --> 00:45:43.858
even though
they don't have mouths.


570
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:45.926
Okay, so Daniel, I can deduce

571
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.829
that you didn't actually
get your INOC


572
00:45:48.863 --> 00:45:51.932
from a certified clinic.

573
00:45:51.966 --> 00:45:54.468
And you're certainly not
in the reticent state.


574
00:45:56.437 --> 00:45:58.472
Daniel, that's bad.

575
00:46:08.382 --> 00:46:10.284
Daniel, listen to me now.

576
00:46:12.286 --> 00:46:14.955
I think that I can help you.

577
00:46:14.989 --> 00:46:17.224
I'm a doctor.

578
00:46:17.258 --> 00:46:19.260
I mean, I... I was a doctor

579
00:46:19.293 --> 00:46:21.462
before they closed
the hospitals down.


580
00:46:23.565 --> 00:46:25.600
But I would like
to try to help you, Daniel.


581
00:46:28.336 --> 00:46:31.606
<i>This drug that
Meredith's company is making...</i>


582
00:46:33.575 --> 00:46:35.443
<i>is this what it's going
to do to us?</i>


583
00:46:37.311 --> 00:46:38.879
<i>Change everything?</i>

584
00:46:41.182 --> 00:46:42.551
<i>It made me think.</i>

585
00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:01.135
Hi, honey.

586
00:47:04.205 --> 00:47:05.674
How was your day?

587
00:47:05.707 --> 00:47:07.975
It was great.

588
00:47:08.008 --> 00:47:10.444
I served old men coffee all day

589
00:47:10.478 --> 00:47:13.147
while they made their usual
disgusting comments.


590
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.016
Honey, I told you,
I'm gonna go down there


591
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.952
and put an end to all of that!

592
00:47:17.985 --> 00:47:20.321
Oh, that's a great idea, dad.

593
00:47:20.354 --> 00:47:23.090
Go down there
and make a fool out of yourself.


594
00:47:23.124 --> 00:47:24.559
Get me fired.

595
00:47:24.593 --> 00:47:27.261
Then who the hell
is gonna take care of us then?


596
00:47:27.294 --> 00:47:28.563
Take care of you?

597
00:47:30.331 --> 00:47:31.932
Honey, come on.

598
00:47:31.966 --> 00:47:33.310
When mum went away,
you had tons of money.


599
00:47:33.334 --> 00:47:35.002
Honey, I'm tryin'.

600
00:47:37.371 --> 00:47:39.340
You're trying?

601
00:47:39.373 --> 00:47:41.342
You really wanna try, dad?

602
00:47:41.375 --> 00:47:44.713
Then try telling me
what happened to mum.


603
00:47:44.746 --> 00:47:46.380
Why she ended up
in that hospital?


604
00:47:46.414 --> 00:47:47.281
Not that again.

605
00:47:47.314 --> 00:47:48.482
Yes, this again.

606
00:47:56.424 --> 00:47:57.458
Honey.

607
00:47:57.491 --> 00:47:58.693
Just another secret, right?

608
00:48:24.218 --> 00:48:28.122
It is a gift,
and by our divine clarity,


609
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:30.725
we praise its nobility.

610
00:48:30.759 --> 00:48:33.662
Inherent,
with unwavering commitment,


611
00:48:33.695 --> 00:48:38.432
vos shall see in all the beauty
of the infinite,


612
00:48:38.466 --> 00:48:40.769
for our neoteric dawn

613
00:48:40.802 --> 00:48:43.337
will triumphantly continue
within us.


614
00:48:44.806 --> 00:48:50.244
Keep its glory
as we reside here forever.


615
00:48:50.277 --> 00:48:54.114
Be virtuous
through endless days.


616
00:48:54.148 --> 00:48:57.985
Gather faithfully
and committed to power.


617
00:49:18.105 --> 00:49:21.576
Jade, when I got home,
I went to my office


618
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.250
and I noticed
that my console was missing.


619
00:49:26.547 --> 00:49:27.625
I can't believe
you would take this


620
00:49:27.649 --> 00:49:29.551
without my permission.

621
00:49:30.819 --> 00:49:33.622
No, Mr. Lloyd, I...

622
00:49:33.655 --> 00:49:35.256
I didn't, honest.

623
00:49:35.289 --> 00:49:38.459
I mean... I mean,
it's a long story.


624
00:49:38.492 --> 00:49:40.261
I... I have no idea
how that happened.


625
00:49:40.294 --> 00:49:42.496
Olivia told me that...
that her game was acting all...


626
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:43.665
Did Olivia play this game?

627
00:49:46.534 --> 00:49:48.168
Did she see any of this?

628
00:49:48.202 --> 00:49:50.204
No, I took it from her
when I... when I saw...


629
00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:52.139
Tell me she didn't see
what I just watched.


630
00:49:54.776 --> 00:49:57.378
No, I took it
from her right away


631
00:49:57.411 --> 00:49:59.246
and then I bought her
a new one at the store.


632
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.347
Okay.

633
00:50:03.685 --> 00:50:05.085
Okay.

634
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:13.628
It wasn't enough
to progress mankind.


635
00:50:13.662 --> 00:50:14.729
No.

636
00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:18.800
We had to reinvent it.

637
00:50:22.403 --> 00:50:25.306
What arrogance to think
we had the right.


638
00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:34.214
Before all of this,
anyone would admit


639
00:50:34.248 --> 00:50:36.283
that we were holding on
by a thread...


640
00:50:38.887 --> 00:50:40.722
but at least we were holding on.

641
00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:45.560
Holding onto hope.

642
00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:49.564
To be decent.

643
00:50:52.399 --> 00:50:53.602
To be better...

644
00:50:57.271 --> 00:50:59.373
but this abomination
took away that hope,


645
00:51:03.344 --> 00:51:08.148
and it took all the things
that made us human...


646
00:51:10.585 --> 00:51:12.319
away forever.

647
00:51:12.353 --> 00:51:14.421
You need to show this to Bob!

648
00:51:14.455 --> 00:51:16.523
You're absolutely insane.

649
00:51:16.558 --> 00:51:18.593
I'm not showing my boss
some stupid kids' game...


650
00:51:18.627 --> 00:51:20.227
This is not a kids' game.

651
00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:21.706
So that he can pull the plug
on my project.


652
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:22.664
This is not a kids' game
that I'm talking about,


653
00:51:22.697 --> 00:51:24.198
Meredith. This... this is.

654
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:25.499
Right.

655
00:51:25.532 --> 00:51:26.601
An AI something or other.

656
00:51:26.635 --> 00:51:28.369
Meredith, you know what I do.

657
00:51:28.402 --> 00:51:30.371
This other version
that I created, it's limitless.


658
00:51:30.404 --> 00:51:33.440
It has...
It has infinite intelligence.


659
00:51:33.474 --> 00:51:34.952
So what you're telling me
is you brought


660
00:51:34.976 --> 00:51:37.211
a highly illegal piece
of technology


661
00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:38.647
into our home,

662
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.547
- with our daughter here.
- Meredith.


663
00:51:40.582 --> 00:51:42.225
Something we could be
arrested for, or worse.


664
00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:43.360
You don't understand.
You don't understand.


665
00:51:43.384 --> 00:51:44.886
The console knows everything.

666
00:51:44.919 --> 00:51:46.888
Really?

667
00:51:46.921 --> 00:51:48.823
Maybe it knows
where you went wrong with us.


668
00:51:50.825 --> 00:51:52.459
Meredith, just watch it.

669
00:51:52.493 --> 00:51:53.662
You'll see!

670
00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:56.907
If you do
what you're plannin' on doin',


671
00:51:56.931 --> 00:51:58.532
it... it will destroy everything.

672
00:51:58.566 --> 00:52:00.735
Please, Myles.

673
00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:05.439
I'll bring it to your board
myself, tomorrow.


674
00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:13.313
That's not a game
you wanna play, Myles.


675
00:52:15.482 --> 00:52:16.661
You shouldn't have even
let me know


676
00:52:16.685 --> 00:52:18.252
you were playing it.

677
00:52:35.335 --> 00:52:36.905
Daddy!

678
00:52:36.938 --> 00:52:37.938
Wait in the car.

679
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:41.952
- Meredith turned me in.
- What... what's going on?


680
00:52:41.976 --> 00:52:43.520
- Meredith turned me in.
- What do you mean?


681
00:52:43.544 --> 00:52:44.789
Look, they're...
they're coming for me.


682
00:52:44.813 --> 00:52:45.747
- Who?
- Look, just... just listen.


683
00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.949
Just take this, okay?

684
00:52:47.982 --> 00:52:49.784
- They're coming for me.
- Who?


685
00:52:49.818 --> 00:52:51.518
Look, I need you
to take my daughter.


686
00:52:51.553 --> 00:52:53.021
Just take my daughter.

687
00:52:53.054 --> 00:52:54.464
Take her far away from here
and keep her safe.


688
00:52:54.488 --> 00:52:55.724
Keep her away from Meredith!

689
00:52:55.757 --> 00:52:56.825
Away!

690
00:52:56.858 --> 00:52:57.992
I can't trust anybody.

691
00:52:58.026 --> 00:52:59.728
If they ask you,
tell you that I...


692
00:52:59.761 --> 00:53:01.663
tell them that I told you to...

693
00:53:01.696 --> 00:53:03.898
I gave you permission to...
to go on a trip with her.


694
00:53:03.932 --> 00:53:06.835
And uh, just keep Olivia away
from Meredith.


695
00:53:06.868 --> 00:53:08.402
- Away, you hear me?
- Yeah, okay.


696
00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:09.637
And take care of her.

697
00:53:09.671 --> 00:53:11.271
Promise me that you'll do that.

698
00:53:11.305 --> 00:53:12.941
I promise.

699
00:53:12.974 --> 00:53:14.008
I promise!

700
00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:09.764
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

701
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:12.901
<i>It was actually happening.</i>

702
00:54:28.583 --> 00:54:32.987
<i>encrypted code
for his modified game console.</i>


703
00:54:33.021 --> 00:54:36.057
<i>It has been determined
that the learning algorithms</i>


704
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.059
<i>are leagues ahead
of even what the government</i>


705
00:54:38.092 --> 00:54:39.928
<i>has ever seen.</i>

706
00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:42.797
<i>The fear is that technology
this advanced,</i>


707
00:54:42.831 --> 00:54:46.668
<i>if in the wrong hands,
could be catastrophic.</i>


708
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:49.771
<i>After a month,
Myles Lloyd still awaits trial.</i>


709
00:54:49.804 --> 00:54:53.007
<i>Additionally, there has been
no new information</i>


710
00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:56.077
<i>regarding Lloyd's daughter,
Olivia,</i>


711
00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.079
who has been missing
since the day of the raid.


712
00:55:00.081 --> 00:55:02.984
<i>The A.I.D.A continues
to urge the public</i>


713
00:55:03.017 --> 00:55:05.153
<i>to contact local authorities
immediately</i>


714
00:55:05.186 --> 00:55:07.521
<i>with any information
on her possible whereabouts.</i>


715
00:55:31.913 --> 00:55:33.147
Get another lead.

716
00:55:44.993 --> 00:55:46.961
Time.

717
00:55:46.995 --> 00:55:51.431
It's a novel concept, I know,
but I still keep track of it.


718
00:55:53.668 --> 00:55:57.739
It's been over two decades
that I've been living down here,


719
00:55:57.772 --> 00:56:00.008
isolated from the madness
up top.


720
00:56:02.744 --> 00:56:04.779
That's an unrecognizable
place now.


721
00:56:06.648 --> 00:56:10.718
While the infinites enjoy
their timeless days in grandeur,


722
00:56:10.752 --> 00:56:12.062
there are three sets
of ephemerals


723
00:56:12.086 --> 00:56:13.721
enduring this new world.

724
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:17.759
Those who are on the list,

725
00:56:17.792 --> 00:56:20.128
desperately waiting
for their names to be called,


726
00:56:22.597 --> 00:56:26.034
those who are deemed too sick
to receive their glorious gift,


727
00:56:27.869 --> 00:56:30.104
and those who think
it's all an atrocity.


728
00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:33.574
Those are the ones
who end up abandoned.


729
00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:55.897
We found her here last night.

730
00:57:02.203 --> 00:57:04.205
This is so sad.

731
00:57:06.841 --> 00:57:10.510
So, you're telling me,
that Meredith's daughter


732
00:57:10.544 --> 00:57:12.580
is literally on the run
with the daughter


733
00:57:12.613 --> 00:57:14.782
of one of the past subjects?

734
00:57:16.784 --> 00:57:19.220
This may hinder
Meredith's performance,


735
00:57:19.253 --> 00:57:20.955
right when we need her the most.

736
00:57:29.597 --> 00:57:31.099
We should go now, Sarah.

737
00:57:32.834 --> 00:57:34.102
Come back for her.

738
00:57:44.846 --> 00:57:48.850
Perhaps no one will show,
but someone may.


739
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.689
We always have hope.

740
00:57:54.722 --> 00:57:56.157
Right to the end.

741
00:58:01.662 --> 00:58:03.831
Do excuse me for one minute,
please sir.


742
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.268
Sarah, what is it?

743
00:58:08.903 --> 00:58:09.904
Amber.

744
00:58:13.941 --> 00:58:17.278
Sherman, we need to talk
about the gray skin.


745
00:58:17.311 --> 00:58:19.914
I got it all figured out.

746
00:58:19.947 --> 00:58:21.215
You do?

747
00:58:21.249 --> 00:58:22.683
Yes, I do, Bob.

748
00:58:25.753 --> 00:58:27.021
Okay.

749
00:58:27.055 --> 00:58:30.024
We'll all have
the same color skin.


750
00:58:30.058 --> 00:58:32.326
So now, I'm gifting the world

751
00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.695
with more than
just longevity, Bob.


752
00:58:34.729 --> 00:58:35.729
Think about it.

753
00:58:39.233 --> 00:58:41.769
- Sherman, that's...
- I know it is.


754
00:58:41.803 --> 00:58:43.838
So what?
We... we just run with it?


755
00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:45.649
That's why you're the face
of the company, Bob


756
00:58:45.673 --> 00:58:46.607
and I'm the brains.

757
00:58:46.641 --> 00:58:48.142
Yes, we just run with it!

758
00:59:03.891 --> 00:59:04.892
Sherman.

759
00:59:04.926 --> 00:59:06.727
It's the water, Bob!

760
00:59:06.761 --> 00:59:08.896
The water!

761
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:11.132
The reason
I can think so clearly


762
00:59:11.165 --> 00:59:13.968
is all the time
I spend on the water.


763
00:59:57.845 --> 00:59:59.313
<i>Her name was Amber.</i>

764
01:00:01.082 --> 01:00:02.750
She was a sweet young lady.

765
01:00:04.886 --> 01:00:06.754
The kids brought her to me, too.

766
01:00:07.889 --> 01:00:09.991
Those kids.

767
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.863
They found her crying
on a park bench.


768
01:00:18.432 --> 01:00:20.272
She said her parents
threw her out of the house


769
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:22.303
because she wouldn't take INOC.

770
01:00:25.973 --> 01:00:29.043
She knew she couldn't do it.

771
01:00:29.076 --> 01:00:32.280
The minute she saw her
older brother


772
01:00:32.313 --> 01:00:35.249
after his visit to the clinic,

773
01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:39.353
sittin' there in this bedroom,
just starin' out into space...


774
01:00:41.856 --> 01:00:44.292
the whole thing just scared her.

775
01:01:03.511 --> 01:01:05.079
There she is.

776
01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:15.256
Just... just seat
yourselves right there at the table, boys.


777
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:16.757
Uh, there.

778
01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:18.492
Just make yourselves
right at home.


779
01:01:18.526 --> 01:01:19.860
Thank you, ma'am.
We're from...


780
01:01:19.894 --> 01:01:21.214
Oh, I...
I know where you're from.


781
01:01:23.397 --> 01:01:26.767
Finally. I... I've been waiting.

782
01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:30.271
Oh. I'm sorry.

783
01:01:30.304 --> 01:01:33.908
I... I... I... I'm just...
I'm so excited.


784
01:01:35.042 --> 01:01:36.143
Uh...

785
01:01:39.914 --> 01:01:41.082
And here you are.

786
01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:44.518
Well, thank you for the...

787
01:01:44.553 --> 01:01:47.088
No, thank you. Thank you.

788
01:01:50.057 --> 01:01:53.261
So, we've come a long way
to talk to you.


789
01:01:53.294 --> 01:01:57.164
Oh, wait, biscuits.

790
01:01:57.198 --> 01:01:59.000
I insist.

791
01:01:59.033 --> 01:02:00.134
They're from scratch.

792
01:02:00.167 --> 01:02:01.570
They're from scratch.

793
01:02:01.603 --> 01:02:02.937
One minute.

794
01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:08.876
Hey!

795
01:02:08.909 --> 01:02:11.078
Join in on the fun.

796
01:02:11.112 --> 01:02:14.115
Oh yes,
we are going to have some fun.


797
01:02:18.185 --> 01:02:22.390
Boys, um, do you think
that I should change?


798
01:02:23.924 --> 01:02:26.460
Ma'am?

799
01:02:26.494 --> 01:02:31.332
Um, well, this is just such
a special occasion.


800
01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:32.567
If I had known...

801
01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:38.372
I would have done my hair.

802
01:02:42.209 --> 01:02:44.312
If we can get started.

803
01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:47.348
Could you tell us
exactly where you were.


804
01:02:47.381 --> 01:02:49.150
And also when.

805
01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:51.919
It was clearly daytime
but an approximate time of day


806
01:02:51.952 --> 01:02:53.054
would be very helpful.

807
01:02:54.355 --> 01:02:57.258
Uh, boys,

808
01:02:57.291 --> 01:03:00.629
I would like to play
for you my favorite song,


809
01:03:00.662 --> 01:03:04.566
because this is such
a special occasion.


810
01:03:04.599 --> 01:03:05.600
Wait.

811
01:03:12.306 --> 01:03:13.407
There.

812
01:03:28.389 --> 01:03:30.524
Ma'am, your... your music.

813
01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:32.159
Isn't it glorious?

814
01:03:33.994 --> 01:03:36.230
Can we kindly see
the image on your cell phone?


815
01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:39.066
The print came on a bit grainy.

816
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.936
Yeah, it... it would help
if we could just see...


817
01:03:41.969 --> 01:03:43.371
Tho... those things?

818
01:03:45.106 --> 01:03:49.343
Boys, I tell everyone
if you want to talk to me,


819
01:03:51.646 --> 01:03:52.980
you know where I live.

820
01:03:53.013 --> 01:03:54.949
We would like to see it anyway.

821
01:03:54.982 --> 01:04:00.321
Oh, I do have a spring dress.

822
01:04:00.354 --> 01:04:01.389
I do.

823
01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:03.391
It... it's... it's got polka dots.

824
01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:05.493
It's pink and black.

825
01:04:05.526 --> 01:04:08.563
Ma'am,
we're here about the girl.


826
01:04:08.597 --> 01:04:09.964
Girl?

827
01:04:09.997 --> 01:04:11.399
The Lloyd girl.

828
01:04:11.432 --> 01:04:13.934
The missing girl.

829
01:04:13.968 --> 01:04:16.571
You sent the pictures
from your cell phone.


830
01:04:19.641 --> 01:04:24.713
I told you
I don't have a cell phone.


831
01:04:24.746 --> 01:04:27.181
You know, boys,
I... I'm... I'm ready to go now.


832
01:04:27.214 --> 01:04:29.450
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
there's some confusion.


833
01:04:29.483 --> 01:04:32.052
No! I am not too old!

834
01:04:32.086 --> 01:04:33.320
And I'm not sick!

835
01:04:33.354 --> 01:04:34.656
Boys, you came here,

836
01:04:34.689 --> 01:04:35.557
you came here to take me
to the clinic...


837
01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.024
Ma'am, ma'am.

838
01:04:37.057 --> 01:04:38.325
We're not here for that.

839
01:04:41.228 --> 01:04:43.531
We're here to find the girl.

840
01:04:43.565 --> 01:04:45.099
I am the girl.

841
01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:46.367
I'm the one!

842
01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.302
I'm the one
that you're looking for!


843
01:04:48.335 --> 01:04:50.337
The healthy girl!

844
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:52.039
You'll see.

845
01:04:52.072 --> 01:04:53.450
They... when...
when they see me at the clinic,


846
01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:55.577
they will know
I am the healthy one.


847
01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:57.011
They will accept me.

848
01:04:57.044 --> 01:05:00.481
Oh, they will definitely
accept me.


849
01:05:00.514 --> 01:05:03.652
When they see... when they see
how able I am...


850
01:05:03.685 --> 01:05:05.986
When they see how able I am,
they will...


851
01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.389
they will accept me.

852
01:05:08.422 --> 01:05:09.490
I'm... I am healthy.

853
01:05:09.523 --> 01:05:11.292
Watch.

854
01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.562
See, I can do jumping jacks!
I can do jumping jacks!


855
01:05:13.595 --> 01:05:15.463
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We should...

856
01:05:15.496 --> 01:05:17.164
Look, I can... 
I can dance, too!

857
01:05:17.198 --> 01:05:18.432
Watch.

858
01:05:18.466 --> 01:05:19.467
Um, I can dance.

859
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.136
I can dance. I can dance.

860
01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:24.305
This was a mistake.

861
01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:25.515
- I can dance!
- So very sorry.


862
01:05:25.539 --> 01:05:27.141
Oh, please, I can dance!
I can...


863
01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:28.108
oh, I can do jumping jacks.

864
01:05:28.142 --> 01:05:29.176
Watch.

865
01:05:31.245 --> 01:05:33.013
Have a good day, ma'am.

866
01:05:33.047 --> 01:05:34.048
Oh, I can do dance.

867
01:05:34.081 --> 01:05:35.549
I can dance.

868
01:05:35.584 --> 01:05:36.584
I can dance!

869
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:39.320
Look, Jadey.

870
01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:41.355
Cool!

871
01:05:41.388 --> 01:05:43.491
I like it here. I wanna stay.

872
01:05:43.524 --> 01:05:46.494
Yeah, I like it, too, bugger.

873
01:05:46.527 --> 01:05:48.229
Then can we stay?

874
01:05:48.262 --> 01:05:51.165
I don't wanna keep going
to new places all the time.


875
01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:52.366
You really wanna stay?

876
01:05:52.399 --> 01:05:55.269
Definitely. I love it here.

877
01:05:55.302 --> 01:05:58.339
Tell you what, we'll stay
as long as we can, okay?


878
01:05:58.372 --> 01:05:59.608
Yes.

879
01:06:05.614 --> 01:06:07.682
You want to say somethin'?
Say it.


880
01:06:09.684 --> 01:06:12.052
Why haven't you taken it?

881
01:06:12.086 --> 01:06:13.086
Hmm.

882
01:06:14.255 --> 01:06:15.489
You see that it works.

883
01:06:15.523 --> 01:06:17.324
Their DNA
is regenerating perfectly.


884
01:06:19.226 --> 01:06:20.461
I will soon.

885
01:06:20.494 --> 01:06:21.572
I just have to wrap up
my affairs


886
01:06:21.596 --> 01:06:24.566
and then I'll be takin' it.

887
01:06:24.599 --> 01:06:27.201
Why would you need to do that?

888
01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:32.106
Well, Bob...
what if after I take it...


889
01:06:34.776 --> 01:06:36.243
things are different?

890
01:06:38.613 --> 01:06:40.214
Not following.

891
01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:43.350
You are followin', Bob,
you always follow.


892
01:06:43.384 --> 01:06:44.686
You're just not listenin'.

893
01:06:48.389 --> 01:06:52.159
What are they now Bob,
the four subjects?


894
01:06:52.192 --> 01:06:55.764
We know they were people
who knew they're going to die.


895
01:06:57.566 --> 01:06:59.601
Now they believe they won't.

896
01:07:01.235 --> 01:07:02.503
Will they?

897
01:07:04.305 --> 01:07:06.140
Does it work?

898
01:07:06.173 --> 01:07:07.609
How do I know?

899
01:07:07.642 --> 01:07:09.310
You said it would.

900
01:07:11.178 --> 01:07:13.247
You're askin' me, Bob,
and I'm really moved.


901
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.283
But you're asking me
if I'm so brilliant,


902
01:07:16.317 --> 01:07:20.220
I can create a new genus, Bob.

903
01:07:20.254 --> 01:07:23.424
At least I believe that's what
you're asking me, right?


904
01:07:23.457 --> 01:07:24.826
Of course not.

905
01:07:24.859 --> 01:07:27.394
But that is
what you're askin' me, Bob!


906
01:07:29.664 --> 01:07:30.865
Gender, male.

907
01:07:30.899 --> 01:07:32.801
Average lifespan, 79 years.

908
01:07:32.834 --> 01:07:35.637
Gender, female,
average lifespan, 82 years.


909
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:38.640
That's what I'm up against, Bob!

910
01:07:38.673 --> 01:07:40.575
But you hold me
in such high regard.


911
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:43.310
It's kind of embarrassing.

912
01:07:43.344 --> 01:07:44.879
The data says it works.

913
01:07:44.913 --> 01:07:46.480
The data.

914
01:07:46.513 --> 01:07:48.583
The analysis has been spot on.

915
01:07:48.617 --> 01:07:50.150
Yeah, so what?

916
01:07:50.184 --> 01:07:51.352
So, it works.

917
01:07:51.385 --> 01:07:54.623
Look around, Bob!

918
01:07:54.656 --> 01:07:57.391
I can't guarantee a win here!

919
01:07:57.424 --> 01:07:59.928
She's a tough opponent,
the bitch mother nature.


920
01:07:59.961 --> 01:08:02.731
So, we launch INOC,
knowing it might not work?


921
01:08:02.764 --> 01:08:07.702
Sometimes,
Bob, the things you say.


922
01:08:11.372 --> 01:08:12.841
What are we doing here?

923
01:08:14.876 --> 01:08:18.680
It's just another promise!

924
01:08:18.713 --> 01:08:20.547
What?

925
01:08:20.582 --> 01:08:26.621
Bob, everything for sale
is a promise.


926
01:08:27.956 --> 01:08:31.492
And it's so easy
to embrace a promise.


927
01:08:31.525 --> 01:08:32.727
It's a promise.

928
01:08:32.761 --> 01:08:35.897
They're so fucking cute.

929
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:38.767
Promise me
you won't say anything.


930
01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.969
Promise. Promise me, promise me.

931
01:08:41.002 --> 01:08:43.705
A promise isn't good enough
on this one, Bob.


932
01:08:45.573 --> 01:08:47.876
We need to sell hope.

933
01:08:47.909 --> 01:08:49.343
You with me?

934
01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:50.210
Hope.

935
01:08:50.244 --> 01:08:52.312
Do you know why?

936
01:08:52.346 --> 01:08:53.882
No.

937
01:08:53.915 --> 01:08:58.687
Because there's more money
in hope


938
01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.289
than any other
intangible commodity on Earth.


939
01:09:05.794 --> 01:09:07.361
Money?

940
01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:09.731
Oh, that's rich, Bob.

941
01:09:09.764 --> 01:09:11.498
You know, my grandfather,
for years, told me


942
01:09:11.532 --> 01:09:14.736
that lobsters lived forever.

943
01:09:14.769 --> 01:09:17.839
He promised me that was true.

944
01:09:17.872 --> 01:09:21.275
And as a kid, I believed that.

945
01:09:22.711 --> 01:09:24.311
But let me ask you this,

946
01:09:24.344 --> 01:09:27.414
even after I found out
that it wasn't true,


947
01:09:27.448 --> 01:09:33.420
and my heart was broken truly,
and I knew it wasn't true,


948
01:09:33.454 --> 01:09:35.657
what was I left with?

949
01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:40.360
Hope.

950
01:09:40.394 --> 01:09:41.863
Hope!

951
01:09:45.365 --> 01:09:47.401
Sometimes, that's the only thing

952
01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:50.972
left behind
from a failed promise, Bobby.


953
01:09:54.475 --> 01:09:56.644
That feeling of hope.

954
01:09:58.847 --> 01:10:01.281
It never fades,
not even false hope.


955
01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:03.785
Don't ask me.

956
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.490
Sherman, if we don't even know
if it works...


957
01:10:09.523 --> 01:10:13.661
I never said it doesn't work!

958
01:10:13.695 --> 01:10:14.896
It could!

959
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:19.634
But because you asked Bob,

960
01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:21.736
we're makin' money,
that's what we're doin'.


961
01:10:23.705 --> 01:10:26.540
You don't need any more money,
Sherman.


962
01:10:26.574 --> 01:10:28.643
You have enough
to last a million lifetimes.


963
01:10:28.676 --> 01:10:31.345
The irony in what you just said.

964
01:10:37.652 --> 01:10:39.721
Sherman, at the very least,

965
01:10:39.754 --> 01:10:42.456
you figured out a way
to slow down aging.


966
01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:44.424
- I... I mean that's...
- That's what?


967
01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:46.094
Why don't we just
pitch it that way?


968
01:10:46.127 --> 01:10:48.963
So we don't get torn to pieces?

969
01:10:48.997 --> 01:10:52.399
INOC is a drug
that regenerates DNA.


970
01:10:52.432 --> 01:10:53.568
It prolongs life.

971
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:54.501
I've thought about that,
actually,


972
01:10:54.535 --> 01:10:56.303
but it's not enough!

973
01:10:58.072 --> 01:10:59.841
But if that's what it is, then...

974
01:10:59.874 --> 01:11:01.776
We don't know what it is, Bob!

975
01:11:03.645 --> 01:11:05.613
And you're forgetting
about choice.


976
01:11:09.483 --> 01:11:10.552
What?

977
01:11:11.686 --> 01:11:13.822
Hasn't it crossed your mind

978
01:11:13.855 --> 01:11:16.958
that the world
would need to make a choice?


979
01:11:16.991 --> 01:11:20.427
Every human being
will have to choose


980
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.130
between living forever...

981
01:11:22.163 --> 01:11:24.799
and good old Mother Nature.

982
01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:27.068
So curiosity?

983
01:11:27.101 --> 01:11:28.803
That's your motivation?

984
01:11:28.837 --> 01:11:30.839
Yes. It's everything, all of it.

985
01:11:32.974 --> 01:11:35.085
Okay, the way I see it,
there are three likely outcomes.


986
01:11:35.109 --> 01:11:37.812
First,
INOC prolongs their lives.


987
01:11:39.714 --> 01:11:41.091
We told them it would make them
live forever,


988
01:11:41.115 --> 01:11:42.884
but we came up a little short.

989
01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:44.719
But they'll still line up
to get it.


990
01:11:44.752 --> 01:11:46.888
Second,
INOC doesn't work at all,


991
01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:48.132
makes people go insane
or something,


992
01:11:48.156 --> 01:11:50.124
destroys humanity, whatever.

993
01:11:50.158 --> 01:11:52.160
We're not too far from that now,
are we?


994
01:11:52.193 --> 01:11:55.830
Third, INOC actually works.

995
01:11:55.864 --> 01:11:57.765
We don't die.

996
01:11:57.799 --> 01:11:59.734
Their DNA keeps regenerating.

997
01:12:02.904 --> 01:12:07.876
I'm... well, at that point,
I would be what?


998
01:12:07.909 --> 01:12:10.410
More than a messiah.

999
01:12:12.512 --> 01:12:14.414
I don't know what to say.

1000
01:12:14.448 --> 01:12:16.516
Don't say anything.

1001
01:12:18.485 --> 01:12:20.688
Whatever will be will be, Bob.

1002
01:12:20.722 --> 01:12:23.658
The only difference is
how I pitch it


1003
01:12:23.691 --> 01:12:26.094
and I've decided to pitch it
like this.


1004
01:12:28.596 --> 01:12:30.832
The greatest invention
for mankind


1005
01:12:30.865 --> 01:12:34.702
and the greatest experiment
on mankind!


1006
01:12:34.736 --> 01:12:36.638
Not bad, huh?

1007
01:12:36.671 --> 01:12:39.674
And it's all because of me.

1008
01:12:50.952 --> 01:12:53.054
They said I wasn't
gonna be around much longer.


1009
01:12:55.957 --> 01:12:59.661
I... I figured that was it,
Daniel.


1010
01:13:04.032 --> 01:13:05.600
I'm not ready.

1011
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:09.137
I know.

1012
01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:10.872
I know, Daniel.
I know you're not ready.


1013
01:13:13.641 --> 01:13:15.910
But no one really ever is.

1014
01:13:19.513 --> 01:13:21.015
But it can't be changed.

1015
01:13:23.952 --> 01:13:26.754
The world outside is trying.

1016
01:13:31.826 --> 01:13:33.227
It won't work.

1017
01:13:39.867 --> 01:13:44.038
Every story...
has a beginning...


1018
01:13:46.107 --> 01:13:47.507
and an end.

1019
01:13:50.712 --> 01:13:52.213
You still up, bugger?

1020
01:13:55.183 --> 01:13:57.517
Yeah.

1021
01:13:57.552 --> 01:13:58.753
You okay?

1022
01:14:00.822 --> 01:14:02.123
I hope dad's okay.

1023
01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:24.946
I know what Meredith
did to my mother


1024
01:14:24.979 --> 01:14:26.114
and you let it happen.

1025
01:14:29.684 --> 01:14:32.787
All right, time to go to sleep.

1026
01:14:39.627 --> 01:14:40.895
It's me.

1027
01:14:40.928 --> 01:14:43.064
It is you.

1028
01:14:43.097 --> 01:14:44.899
It's so good to hear your voice.

1029
01:14:48.102 --> 01:14:50.671
What is it?
What do you need, honey?


1030
01:14:50.705 --> 01:14:53.007
For you to listen.

1031
01:14:53.041 --> 01:14:54.842
Okay.

1032
01:14:54.876 --> 01:14:55.743
I mean it.

1033
01:14:55.777 --> 01:14:56.811
Honey, what?

1034
01:14:56.844 --> 01:14:58.713
I know what happened to mom.

1035
01:14:58.746 --> 01:15:00.715
I know where you got
all that money.


1036
01:15:00.748 --> 01:15:02.216
I know everything.

1037
01:15:09.824 --> 01:15:10.992
Dad?

1038
01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:38.753
<i>Yeah,
we took a risk by going to town.</i>


1039
01:15:38.786 --> 01:15:40.755
<i>We just felt like getting
some ice cream.</i>


1040
01:15:43.057 --> 01:15:47.395
<i>I figured
who's gonna find us out here?</i>


1041
01:15:47.428 --> 01:15:49.363
<i>In the middle of nowhere.</i>

1042
01:16:24.232 --> 01:16:25.733
I miss my dad.

1043
01:16:27.969 --> 01:16:29.103
What about mom?

1044
01:16:41.482 --> 01:16:42.750
Well, you know...

1045
01:16:44.385 --> 01:16:46.821
I promised your dad
that we would stick together


1046
01:16:46.854 --> 01:16:47.854
for a little bit...

1047
01:16:50.258 --> 01:16:51.759
and I made a promise
to someone else


1048
01:16:51.792 --> 01:16:53.294
about keeping promises.

1049
01:16:56.264 --> 01:17:00.034
So, bugger,
you're stuck with me.


1050
01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:18.186
But you did find us.

1051
01:17:20.454 --> 01:17:22.223
You mentioned this game.

1052
01:17:22.256 --> 01:17:23.891
The console
Olivia's father built.


1053
01:17:23.925 --> 01:17:25.293
That's how you...

1054
01:17:25.326 --> 01:17:27.046
That's how I know
Meredith killed my mother.


1055
01:17:30.531 --> 01:17:32.066
She can't hear us.

1056
01:17:37.905 --> 01:17:40.508
I'm sorry,
I sent you all those pictures.


1057
01:17:40.541 --> 01:17:45.513
The old lady and the cell phone,
how did you do that?


1058
01:17:45.546 --> 01:17:48.182
Well, I just went online
and I found there...


1059
01:17:49.951 --> 01:17:51.752
a random name and address
of someone


1060
01:17:51.786 --> 01:17:53.521
who lives far from here.

1061
01:17:53.555 --> 01:17:55.957
And then
I went to a cell phone store.


1062
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:59.827
When the guy behind the counter
asked me for my ID,


1063
01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.231
I uh, I told him that I lost it
along with my phone,


1064
01:18:03.264 --> 01:18:05.233
and that's why
I really needed one.


1065
01:18:10.271 --> 01:18:12.940
I guess I flirted my way
out of that


1066
01:18:12.974 --> 01:18:17.211
and walked out of the store
with a new phone in her name,


1067
01:18:17.245 --> 01:18:19.113
and then I sent you the picture.

1068
01:18:19.146 --> 01:18:21.282
How did you know
I was looking for you?


1069
01:18:21.315 --> 01:18:23.918
I saw Meredith's post
about the reward


1070
01:18:23.951 --> 01:18:26.387
she was offering
for information on Olivia, and...


1071
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.124
and... I saw
your contact information there.


1072
01:18:33.461 --> 01:18:37.798
Well, for the first time
in my career,


1073
01:18:37.832 --> 01:18:39.867
I won't be delivering
for a client.


1074
01:18:52.246 --> 01:18:53.948
Mrs. Lloyd.

1075
01:18:53.981 --> 01:18:56.484
No, used to be.

1076
01:18:56.517 --> 01:18:58.452
Recently divorced.

1077
01:18:58.486 --> 01:19:01.188
So, tell me you found them.

1078
01:19:01.222 --> 01:19:04.525
No, sorry.

1079
01:19:04.559 --> 01:19:07.161
I scoured the entire town.

1080
01:19:07.194 --> 01:19:08.462
Showed the pictures to anyone

1081
01:19:08.496 --> 01:19:11.065
who would give me
the time of day.


1082
01:19:11.098 --> 01:19:14.535
Went to the local
police station, everywhere,


1083
01:19:14.569 --> 01:19:18.306
and it's a small town,
not a thing.


1084
01:19:18.339 --> 01:19:22.243
Maybe the information
you received was flawed.


1085
01:19:22.276 --> 01:19:24.011
It happens.

1086
01:19:24.045 --> 01:19:26.414
Maybe.

1087
01:19:26.447 --> 01:19:28.382
I expect you'll keep looking.

1088
01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:30.484
Of course.

1089
01:19:30.518 --> 01:19:31.919
So, there is another matter

1090
01:19:31.952 --> 01:19:33.487
I need to discuss with you
however.


1091
01:19:33.521 --> 01:19:35.222
Okay.

1092
01:19:35.256 --> 01:19:38.426
It has to do
with unauthorized human trials


1093
01:19:38.459 --> 01:19:42.863
resulting in death,
or some might say murder.


1094
01:19:44.432 --> 01:19:45.900
We are back again,

1095
01:19:45.933 --> 01:19:48.637
outside the now vacant
Lloyd residence.


1096
01:19:48.670 --> 01:19:51.305
Today, marks one year
since the raid on this property


1097
01:19:51.339 --> 01:19:54.342
and the ongoing saga continues.

1098
01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:58.613
As has been highly publicized,
Myles Lloyd has been without...


1099
01:19:58.647 --> 01:20:00.314
Um, has been sentenced
to life in prison


1100
01:20:00.348 --> 01:20:02.316
without the possibility
of parole,


1101
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:06.887
while Lloyd's daughter Olivia
is still yet to be found.


1102
01:20:06.921 --> 01:20:08.989
However, the story
has now centered around


1103
01:20:09.023 --> 01:20:10.524
Meredith Lloyd.

1104
01:20:10.559 --> 01:20:12.069
Authorities have confirmed
that four individuals


1105
01:20:12.093 --> 01:20:13.662
were discovered at PCI

1106
01:20:13.695 --> 01:20:16.030
and reportedly have been held
there against their will.


1107
01:20:17.599 --> 01:20:19.200
<i>Each of these
four individuals claim</i>


1108
01:20:19.233 --> 01:20:20.569
<i>that they were
initially recruited</i>


1109
01:20:20.602 --> 01:20:22.571
<i>to be part of a clinical study</i>

1110
01:20:22.604 --> 01:20:24.081
<i>pertaining to a medication
that was supposed to help them</i>


1111
01:20:24.105 --> 01:20:26.107
<i>with their phobias.</i>

1112
01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.942
<i>They've all stated that instead</i>

1113
01:20:27.975 --> 01:20:29.415
<i>they were given a drug
called "INOC".</i>


1114
01:20:32.079 --> 01:20:34.982
A drug that they were told
would make them live forever.


1115
01:20:36.651 --> 01:20:38.953
Make them live forever.

1116
01:20:38.986 --> 01:20:41.255
Forever.

1117
01:20:41.288 --> 01:20:42.523
Well, that sounds absurd.

1118
01:20:45.426 --> 01:20:47.261
Multiple sources speculate that

1119
01:20:47.294 --> 01:20:49.163
the upcoming release
of this drug is in fact,


1120
01:20:49.196 --> 01:20:50.699
the catalyst
behind the vast number


1121
01:20:50.732 --> 01:20:54.935
of pharmacies providing
free health screenings.


1122
01:20:54.969 --> 01:20:56.504
Authorities have determined that

1123
01:20:56.537 --> 01:20:58.139
Meredith Lloyd,

1124
01:20:58.172 --> 01:20:59.617
without knowledge of
or approval from PCI,


1125
01:20:59.641 --> 01:21:01.909
has in fact performed
unauthorized human...


1126
01:21:06.147 --> 01:21:08.048
and is seemingly responsible

1127
01:21:08.082 --> 01:21:09.483
for countless number of deaths.

1128
01:21:13.688 --> 01:21:16.490
Clearly, this story
isn't going away anytime soon


1129
01:21:16.524 --> 01:21:18.259
and of course,
we'll be right here


1130
01:21:18.292 --> 01:21:19.527
to bring you the latest.

1131
01:21:23.264 --> 01:21:25.132
This family.

1132
01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:27.101
Uh, yeah.

1133
01:21:27.134 --> 01:21:28.445
So, what are we just supposed
to believe


1134
01:21:28.469 --> 01:21:31.038
that PCI had nothing to do
with this?


1135
01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.160
That's the real story here,
don't you think?


1136
01:21:35.577 --> 01:21:38.613
I doubt that'll happen.

1137
01:21:38.647 --> 01:21:40.381
Why not?

1138
01:21:40.414 --> 01:21:43.250
We're one out of like
a million subsidiaries


1139
01:21:43.284 --> 01:21:47.087
that are all owned by,
take a guess.


1140
01:21:51.793 --> 01:21:53.394
Of course.

1141
01:21:53.427 --> 01:21:55.162
All right, teleprompter rolling.

1142
01:21:55.196 --> 01:21:59.133
In five, four, three, two...

1143
01:22:11.045 --> 01:22:12.781
Dad?

1144
01:22:12.814 --> 01:22:16.083
<i>Honey,
it was punishable by death.</i>


1145
01:22:22.089 --> 01:22:23.558
Then I'm all she has now.
