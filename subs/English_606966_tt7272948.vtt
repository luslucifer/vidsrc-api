4
00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:47.791
Hey, everyone.

5
00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:49.993
First of all, I'd like to start
by saying I'm really sorry


6
00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:52.729
that I haven't posted
a video in a few weeks.


7
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:57.534
But the reason is because
Matthew has proposed to me.


8
00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:59.803
Yes, so we are
officially engaged.


9
00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:01.604
I'm so excited, it's
still sinking in.


10
00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.907
And look how
beautiful my ring is.


11
00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.742
I've got loads and loads
of videos to show you guys


12
00:01:05.744 --> 00:01:07.878
over the last few weeks, our
engagement party and stuff,


13
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.781
so I'll be posting those
up when I get a chance.


14
00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:13.684
Another reason why I've
been so busy is I am flying


15
00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:16.286
out to the San Francisco
meet and greet,


16
00:01:16.288 --> 00:01:17.788
so please, you've
all been writing in,


17
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.623
please come along and meet me.

18
00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:20.791
I'm so excited to meet you.

19
00:01:20.793 --> 00:01:23.293
People I've met before,
people I haven't.


20
00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:24.795
So please do come along.

21
00:01:24.797 --> 00:01:28.666
All of the details are below
of where to come and meet me.


22
00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:30.901
I'm coming out to LA today
with my friends Jessica


23
00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:32.770
and Lisa, and we're gonna
be doing the Route 101


24
00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:34.739
all the way to San Francisco.

25
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:36.874
I'm gonna be uploading
all the videos,


26
00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:38.043
so stay tuned for those.

27
00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.079
You guys love Lisa and Jessica
from the Thailand video,


28
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.849
so I'm sure it's gonna be just
as crazy as the last time.


29

(PHONE VIBRATING)

30
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.687
And my Uber is five minutes
away, so I'm gonna go.


31
00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:50.822
But please stay tuned
for more videos.


32
00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:52.389
Like I said, I'm gonna be
uploading them all the time.


33
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:53.892
Like, subscribe, and follow me.

34
00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:55.596
See you in LA, guys, bye.

35
00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:02.501
I just wanted to show
you how gorgeous this is.


36
00:02:02.503 --> 00:02:04.836
So we're traveling over
Westminster Bridge at the moment,


37
00:02:04.838 --> 00:02:07.873
and if you look just ahead,
you can see the iconic Big Ben


38
00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:08.942
just in front of us.

39
00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:17.016
Okay, so I think it's
the next left, just here.


40
00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:18.450
Yep, this one.

41
00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:20.887
And they should be
anywhere around here.


42
00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:21.854
There they are.

43
00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:22.687
Actually, just here, yeah.

44
00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:23.522
Can you just pull here?

45
00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:25.024
Thank you.

46
00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:27.492
Hey, ladies.

47
00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:28.127
Hello.

48
00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.963
Want a ride, chick?

49
00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.568
Oh my gosh, guys, I
can't believe that Jess


50
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.638
is wearing sunglasses on a
typical gloomy day in London.


51
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.040
- Typical.
- Thank you so much.


52
00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:42.875
Oh.

53
00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:44.012
- Hello.
- Hello.


54
00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:47.113
Jesus, you took your time.

55
00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:48.648
We've been freezing
our tits off out here.


56
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.917
Yeah, Soph, what
took you so long?


57
00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.086
SOPH: Sorry, I forgot to
charge the camera, didn't I?


58
00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:54.554
And then, when the driver came,

59
00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:56.491
I just had to check
that I had everything.


60
00:02:58.793 --> 00:02:59.993
Are you okay, Lisa?

61
00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:01.460
- Yeah.
- She's been sick all morning.


62
00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:02.395
SOPH: Oh no.

63
00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:03.663
Yeah, I think it was sushi

64
00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.398
that I had yesterday
at the airport.


65
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.034
Made my belly a bit funny.

66
00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:09.036
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.


67
00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:13.006
SOPH: Okay, so, tell me
then how was the job in Ibiza?


68
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:14.908
Yeah, it was amazing.

69
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.076
Not gonna lie to you,

70
00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:17.811
I literally just got paid to
party for the whole month.


71
00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:19.446
The guys weren't too
bad either, so...


72
00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:21.648
I can't believe it's been
a month since we saw you.


73
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.883
SOPH: I know.

74
00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:25.119
So, how many guys did
you hook up with then?


75
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.053
SOPH: 10?

76
00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:27.855
A lady does not kiss and tell.

77
00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:29.023
Whatever.

78
00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:30.591
I've already lost
count, you dirty bitch.


79
00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:33.061
Oh no, it wasn't
even like that.


80
00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:34.595
Anyway, enough about me.

81
00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:35.930
Let's see this ring then.

82
00:03:35.932 --> 00:03:37.799
SOPH: Here it is.

83
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:38.632
LISA: Oh wow.

84
00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.001
Babe, it's stunning.

85
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:40.869
- Thank you.
- Lucky you.


86
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.436
SOPH: He did a
good job, didn't he?


87
00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:43.872
LISA: Mm.

88
00:03:43.874 --> 00:03:46.540
SOPH: So, okay, say
hello to the camera, girls.


89
00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:48.377
- Hi there.
- Hey there.


90
00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.545
How is all the
vlogging going, babe?


91
00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:51.846
SOPH: Not too bad, thanks.

92
00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:52.847
JESS: You know she's got

93
00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.182
over two million
subscribers now?


94
00:03:54.184 --> 00:03:56.217
- Are you joking?
- No.


95
00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.219
LISA: Babe, that's
amazing, I'm proud of you.


96
00:03:58.221 --> 00:03:59.153
SOPH: Well, thank you.

97
00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:02.157
Yeah, getting there
now, slowly but surely.


98
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.492
So, are you planning on
vlogging the whole trip then or?


99
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.061
SOPH: Yeah, definitely.

100
00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:08.097
I'm not gonna risk
missing anything epic


101
00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.564
like we did last time.

102
00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:12.667
So, girls, wherever we
go, the camera goes.


103
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.668
That is cool with me, babe.

104
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.137
Best behavior then, ladies.

105
00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.205
- You.
- You.


106
00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:18.173
- You.
- No, both of you.


107
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:21.110
- Look at these.
- Mm, nice.


108
00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:23.212
But I think I need a
bikini body though.


109
00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:24.414
Aw, so cute.

110
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.982
Look at you two.

111
00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:27.818
Oh, Jess.

112
00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:31.186
(CHUCKLES)

113
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.155
I just need to
go to the bathroom.


114
00:04:33.157 --> 00:04:33.956
I'm gonna find
you guys in a bit.


115
00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958
SOPH: Oh no,
are you okay, babe?


116
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.693
Yeah, I'll find
you guys in a bit.


117
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:38.928
SOPH: Okay.

118
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.962
We'll go grab a
coffee then, yeah?


119
00:04:39.964 --> 00:04:41.264
Jess.

120
00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:42.265
- Jess.
- Huh, what'd you say?


121
00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:43.199
SOPH: Let's go get coffee.

122
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:44.533
Oh, you're always on your phone.

123
00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:45.469
Come on, let's go.

124
00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:00.650
Jess.

125
00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:02.453
Jess, do you need
to get any suncream?


126
00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.123
Nope.

127
00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:12.164
You are complete and utter
filth, you do know that.


128
00:05:13.865 --> 00:05:15.266
I knew she was gonna do that.

129
00:05:15.268 --> 00:05:16.267
I knew you were gonna do that.

130
00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:18.034
You are so predictable.

131
00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:20.204
JESS: Kiss my ass, baby.

132
00:05:20.206 --> 00:05:21.205
You're probably
gonna get arrested


133
00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:22.839
for stalking in a
minute, you do know that.


134
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:24.108
JESS: Oh, don't
be stupid, will you?


135
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.110
I'm not breaking any laws.

136
00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:28.112
He is quite hot though, Soph.

137
00:05:28.114 --> 00:05:29.880
Suppose there's
no harm in looking.


138
00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:32.216
JESS: Too bad you're
taken eh, Sophie?


139
00:05:32.218 --> 00:05:34.986
Hey, like I said, no
harm in looking, okay?


140
00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:36.787
JESS: Okay, okay.

141
00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.058
Just sowing my seed, that's all.

142
00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:43.327
How is Matt, anyway?

143
00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:45.730
SOPH: Yeah, yeah,
he's really good, thanks.


144
00:05:45.732 --> 00:05:47.299
He's with his parents this
weekend helping them move


145
00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:49.033
into their new home.

146
00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:52.337
And apart from that,
he's busy working.


147
00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.208
Saving for the wedding.

148
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:57.842
Seriously though, you're
a lucky girl, Sophie.


149
00:05:57.844 --> 00:05:58.676
Matt's amazing.

150
00:05:58.678 --> 00:06:00.345
All right, easy, Jess.

151
00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:01.581
What, he is.

152
00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:04.182
We're just jealous of you, babe.

153
00:06:04.184 --> 00:06:06.051
Yeah, we're just really
jealous of you, babe.


154
00:06:06.053 --> 00:06:08.787
SOPH: Aw, well thanks
for the compliments, girls.


155
00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.124
And I know.

156
00:06:11.291 --> 00:06:12.391
Your wedding's
gonna be amazing.


157
00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:15.260
Firstly, I've always wanted
to be a sexy bridesmaid.


158
00:06:15.262 --> 00:06:18.296
And secondly, I'm pretty sure

that Matt's friend Sam wants
me, so that's my night sorted.

You literally have
no chill do you, girl?


161
00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:26.638
You're only being like that

162
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.340
'cause he's not
interested in you.


163
00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:28.707
Wow.

164
00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.709
You can be such
a dick sometimes.


165

two need to pack it in.


166

Baby, text me like that.

167

text me harder.

right in the head.


173
00:06:48.263 --> 00:06:50.663
Have you just
figured that one out?


174
00:06:50.665 --> 00:06:51.831
I don't want to be
with a guy who's more


175
00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:54.634
into his phone than he is in me.

176
00:06:54.636 --> 00:06:56.636
I see it all the time now.

177
00:06:56.638 --> 00:06:57.870
SOPH: You know what,

178
00:06:57.872 --> 00:06:59.739
maybe they're just both
researching something.


179
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:01.242
I don't think so.

180
00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.311
Social media ruins
relationships.


181
00:07:04.313 --> 00:07:06.979
I mean, she's probably
innocently updating her status


182
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.849
and he's probably
inboxing some random girl.


183
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:11.185

184

our massive plan.

her own way again.


191

- You're slow.
- Yes, thank you.

like 12 hours.

198
00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:40.013
Good job I was up
all night then,


199
00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:42.383
so I can sleep all the way.

200

with last night then, missy?


201

SOPH: Come on then,
Jess, who were you with?


202
00:07:51.228 --> 00:07:52.062
Ryan.

203
00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:58.001
He came to the bar to see me
at work and work was quiet,


204
00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:00.403
so finished early and
went back to my...


205
00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:03.204
SOPH: Ryan, after
what he's done to you?


206
00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:04.808
How did that even happen?

207
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:07.408
Oh, I don't know.

208
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.479
He texted me some silly meme
thing about relationships,


209
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:12.213
so I messaged him.

210
00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:14.149
SOPH: Ugh, you're not gonna
get back with him, are you?


211
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:16.718
No, of course not, just
miss him, that's all.


212
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.753
The guy is such a dick.

213
00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:20.322
SOPH: Yeah, I
agree with Lisa, Jess.


214
00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:21.756
I mean, he did cheat on you.

215
00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:23.791
I mean, you don't even
know how many times.


216
00:08:23.793 --> 00:08:24.993
Ugh, the guy is such a loser,

217
00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:27.396
anyway, you can do so
much better than him.


218
00:08:27.398 --> 00:08:29.298
I'm not getting back with him.

219
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.466
It's just a bit of sex.

220
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.802
I mean, a heroin addict don't
just come off it, do they?


221
00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:35.804
They have to ween
themselves off it first,


222
00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:37.339
so that's what I'm doing.

223

As long as you know
what you're doing, babe.

Don't forget how much
he hurt you last time.


225

We just don't wanna see
you go through that again.

watch one of the films.

didn't like flying.

touch the pedals.

SOPH: Why have
they given us this?


324
00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:38.320
I can't even see
over the bonnet.

I actually feel like
a midget in this.

I can't do it, I refuse
to drive this shit.

I'm sorry.

330

SOPH: I'm actually crying,
I can't, I can't deal.


331
00:12:55.273 --> 00:12:56.773
What's the matter, you
hoping for something bigger?


332
00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:58.174
Are you joking?

333
00:12:58.176 --> 00:12:59.208
We need to do something
about this wagon.

Hey, we're in LA,
surgery is a possibility.


341
00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:08.785
SOPH: Oh, shut up.

342
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:11.421
Well, you know if you
head back to the office


343
00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:12.389
and ask to swap,
they'd be up for it.


344
00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.089
- That would be good.
- That would be perfect.


345
00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:15.392
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.


346
00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:16.760
- Cheers.
- Thank you.


347

Now that's more like it.

So, this is our car, guys,
after that little fiasco.


349
00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:24.267
I think it's perfect,
although it's a bit big


350
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:25.669
compared to what we
normally drive in London,


351
00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.671
but we'll get used
to it, it's fine.

LISA: Thanks, babe.

353

Now, are you sure
you're gonna be all right


354
00:13:31.109 --> 00:13:32.209
in this one, Lisa?

355
00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.477
You don't want me to run back

356
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.278
and see if they've got
a smart car or anything?


357
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.413
Smart-ass.

358
00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:37.481
Maybe we'll get a two-seater

359
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.416
and we'll lock you in the booth.

360
00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:41.251
- Thank you, Lisa.
- That's not very nice.


361
00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:42.653
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

- Aw, we will.

put on the air con, babe?

It is on, babe, I know it
is a bit beef jerky in here.

Right, got the address, it's...

00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:22.713
Oh my gosh, we can
literally sit up here


473
00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:24.848
and have breakfast.

474
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.452
Oh my goodness me, look.

475
00:17:27.886 --> 00:17:28.852
Do you know what?

476
00:17:28.854 --> 00:17:30.020
This is better than it
was in the pictures.


477
00:17:30.022 --> 00:17:32.355
- Like way better.
- Love it.


478
00:17:32.357 --> 00:17:34.658
I never expected
it to be like this.


479
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.760
Should we go inside
and have a look inside?


480
00:17:36.762 --> 00:17:37.763
Have a look.

481
00:17:38.864 --> 00:17:40.897
Look at the
sultriness in here.


482
00:17:40.899 --> 00:17:45.335
Sophie, you always deliver,
baby, that's why we love you.

The Egyptian-African
vibe going on in here.

So sultry.

would you like some tea?


490

Yes, darling, feed me.

491
00:18:03.623 --> 00:18:05.757
That'd be nice
after a long flight.

A piano.

493
00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:07.892
I can play the
piano for us later.

My mom and dad would
love this so much.

JESS: Soph, shall
we go see the bedrooms?


499
00:18:17.337 --> 00:18:18.970
Yes, there's
only two bedrooms,


500
00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:20.538
so one of you is gonna
have to share with me.


501
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.874

JESS: It really
smells in here.


504
00:18:26.947 --> 00:18:28.080
What is that smell?

505
00:18:28.082 --> 00:18:30.681
SOPH: Oh, babe,
give me the camera.


506
00:18:30.683 --> 00:18:32.017
It smells like that time
I had that house party


507
00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:34.620
and that guy vomited all
over my parents' carpet.


508
00:18:34.622 --> 00:18:36.021
Do you remember?

509
00:18:36.023 --> 00:18:37.122
Stunk for weeks.

510
00:18:37.124 --> 00:18:38.924
SOPH: Well, don't just
stand there, open a window.


511
00:18:38.926 --> 00:18:41.294
That guy must
love to party, man.


512
00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.796
It's making me feel sick.

513
00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:44.963
All right, let's go
see Lisa's room next.


514
00:18:44.965 --> 00:18:45.931
Anything's gotta be
better than this.

you know what I mean.


517
00:18:49.703 --> 00:18:51.003
I am very grateful.

518
00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:51.839
Ah.

519
00:18:53.073 --> 00:18:54.473
Well, this is an improvement

520
00:18:54.475 --> 00:18:57.376

switch with me, babe?


523
00:19:00.581 --> 00:19:01.513
I feel bad.

524
00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:02.414
SOPH: No, no, it's fine.

525
00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:03.782
It's just for one night.

526
00:19:03.784 --> 00:19:05.551
It's somewhere to
crash, it's fine.


527
00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:06.920
I'll swap with you.

528
00:19:06.922 --> 00:19:08.922
Oh, let me think about it.

529
00:19:08.924 --> 00:19:10.725
Yeah, I've thought about it, no.

530
00:19:12.493 --> 00:19:14.160
SOPH: Okay, girls, I'm
gonna go and message Matthew


531
00:19:14.162 --> 00:19:15.862
and let him know
we've got here safe.


532
00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.831
Get changed and then we'll
head to the Hollywood sign.


533
00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:20.433
- Solid plan.
- Yes, sir.

LISA: Oo, this bed's comfy.

535
00:19:22.437 --> 00:19:23.803
- Yay.
- Jess, Jess, look.


536
00:19:23.805 --> 00:19:25.004
- What?
- Jess, the Hollywood sign.


537
00:19:25.006 --> 00:19:26.105
Quick.

538
00:19:26.107 --> 00:19:27.542
- There.
- Hell yeah.


539
00:19:32.181 --> 00:19:34.549
Oh wow, we are so close.

540
00:19:36.651 --> 00:19:39.119
Guys, I have
something to show you.

Look at this.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.957
Look how close we've managed
to get to the Hollywood sign.


544
00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:44.691
I didn't even know we
could get this close,


545
00:19:44.693 --> 00:19:45.893
I'm so excited to be here.

546
00:19:45.895 --> 00:19:47.862
I've gotta also show
you this view over here.


547
00:19:47.864 --> 00:19:50.664
You can literally see the
whole of LA from here.

It's...

549
00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:52.700
Lisa, are you all right?

550
00:19:52.702 --> 00:19:54.402
LISA: I can't find my phone.

551
00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.604
SOPH: Did you leave
it at the apartment?


552
00:19:56.606 --> 00:19:57.905
I swear I had it in here.

553
00:19:57.907 --> 00:19:59.106
I don't know what
I've done with it.


554
00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:00.007
SOPH: Well, babe,
we were rushing.


555
00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:01.609
I'm sure you've left
it at the apartment


556
00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:02.977
and probably on the
bed or something.


557
00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:04.912
- Don't worry.
- Yeah.


558
00:20:04.914 --> 00:20:07.047
SOPH: Yeah,
definitely not in there?


559
00:20:07.049 --> 00:20:07.915
JESS: What's happened?

560
00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:08.916
SOPH: Ah, Lis
can't find her phone.


561
00:20:08.918 --> 00:20:10.818
Well, have you checked
your bag properly, babe?


562
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.187
Oh, what does it look like?

563
00:20:12.189 --> 00:20:13.121
SOPH: Do you know what?

564
00:20:13.123 --> 00:20:14.122
Maybe it was in your pocket

565
00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:14.923
and it's dropped
down in the car.


566
00:20:14.925 --> 00:20:16.157
Let's have a look, yeah?

567
00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:17.092
Jess, you go and do a
selfie or something.


568

571
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:24.567
I'm sure I had it in my bag.

572
00:20:26.069 --> 00:20:28.904
SOPH: Well, it's
not this side at all.


573
00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:29.871
Is it underneath your chair,

574
00:20:29.873 --> 00:20:31.975
dropped down behind, underneath?

575
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.177
Nothing, sure?

576
00:20:35.045 --> 00:20:36.111
Do you know what?

577
00:20:36.113 --> 00:20:37.779
Like I said, babe, I'm
sure it's at the apartment.

We'll just look for
it when we get back.

- Promise, yeah?
- All right.

Don't let it ruin your day,
babe, because look at this.

Ah, she's a beauty.

she look close up?

No, I think I left it
back at the apartment.

Well, I hope so anyways.

now, 'cause we are here.

630
00:22:18.184 --> 00:22:19.119
Okay.

631
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.619
- Ready?
- Yeah.


632
00:22:21.621 --> 00:22:24.589
Tense those muscles, boys.

633
00:22:24.591 --> 00:22:25.623
Very nice.

634
00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:26.259
Oh, that's hot.

635
00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:29.861
Which one?

636
00:22:29.863 --> 00:22:31.162
Me.

637
00:22:31.164 --> 00:22:33.666
- I guess, already.
- So basic.


638
00:22:35.136 --> 00:22:39.670
Well, okay, I mean, so,
judging by your accents,


639
00:22:39.672 --> 00:22:40.972
you're not from around here.

640
00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:42.374
Right, is that a
good assumption?


641
00:22:42.376 --> 00:22:44.609
Are you guys Australian or?

642
00:22:44.611 --> 00:22:46.677
JESS: Do you
like it down under?


643
00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:48.781
- Oh no.
- I'm not opposed to it.


644
00:22:48.783 --> 00:22:50.648
I wouldn't say no if
given the opportunity.


645
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.118
Okay, too much too
soon there, buddy.


646
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.253
JESS: Oh my, oh my.

647
00:22:54.255 --> 00:22:55.754
LISA: No, we're from London.

648
00:22:55.756 --> 00:22:56.789
What about you guys?

649
00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:58.023
- San Fran.
- Oh really?


650
00:22:58.025 --> 00:22:59.191
- Yeah.
- That's where we're going.


651
00:22:59.193 --> 00:23:00.192
- No way.
- Really?


652
00:23:00.194 --> 00:23:01.026
- Yes way.
- When?


653
00:23:01.028 --> 00:23:02.694
JESS: Tomorrow.

654
00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:03.729
SOPH: Yeah, we're just doing
some sight-seeing here today


655
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:06.131
and, you know, the
obligatory stuff that you do


656
00:23:06.133 --> 00:23:07.335
when you come to LA.

657
00:23:08.769 --> 00:23:11.036
You're seriously
spending one day in LA?


658
00:23:11.038 --> 00:23:12.771
SOPH: Oh no, no no no.

659
00:23:12.773 --> 00:23:13.872
- We're coming back next week.
- There's a lot to do.


660
00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:14.907
SOPH: Yeah, I know, I know.

661
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:16.042
We're coming back next week.

662
00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:17.310
There's just something
that I really


663
00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:18.911
have to go to in San
Fran, that's all.


664
00:23:18.913 --> 00:23:21.014
- Yeah.
- All right, well.


665
00:23:21.016 --> 00:23:22.215
Well, we're gonna go down

666
00:23:22.217 --> 00:23:24.050
to the Hollywood Walk
of Fame next if...


667
00:23:24.052 --> 00:23:24.984
- Oh yeah.
- It's fun.


668
00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:27.053
I mean, it's worth it.

669
00:23:27.055 --> 00:23:29.222
- Probably not today.
- What, why?


670
00:23:29.224 --> 00:23:31.291
SOPH: No, you know,
we're jet-lagged.


671
00:23:31.293 --> 00:23:33.059
We gotta get up in the
morning for San Fran.


672
00:23:33.061 --> 00:23:35.428
Soph, I think it'll
be so good, babe.


673
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.133
I think it sounds like
a really good idea.


674
00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:40.133
- No?
- No.


675
00:23:40.135 --> 00:23:41.435
PHOTO TAKER: Yes?

676
00:23:41.437 --> 00:23:42.969
- Sophie.
- Yes.


677
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:44.405
- Yes.
- Sophie?


678
00:23:44.407 --> 00:23:46.206
SOPH: Okay, okay, fine.

679
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:47.907
No, I'm totally outnumbered.

680
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:49.410
I lose there.

681
00:23:49.412 --> 00:23:51.212
Right, so first of all,
guys, what are your names?


682
00:23:51.214 --> 00:23:54.115
- Well, I'm Cody.
- And I'm Brandon.


683
00:23:54.117 --> 00:23:55.715
- Hi, I'm Jess.
- Hi, Jess.


684
00:23:55.717 --> 00:23:56.517
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi, Jess.


685
00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:58.685
- We kiss in London.
- All right.


686
00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:00.087
- I'm your queen.
- Okay.


687
00:24:00.089 --> 00:24:01.155
- Hey, I'm not opposed.
- Hi.


688
00:24:01.157 --> 00:24:03.723
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Lisa.


689
00:24:03.725 --> 00:24:05.159
Hi, Lisa.

690
00:24:05.161 --> 00:24:06.293
(ALL CHUCKLING)

691
00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:07.328
We shake hands in England.

692
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.764
- Hello.
- In England.


693
00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:11.165
I thought we were in LA.

694
00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:14.135
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, yeah, I am.


695
00:24:14.137 --> 00:24:14.969
SOPH: I'm Sophie.

696
00:24:14.971 --> 00:24:17.338
ALL: Hi, Sophie.

697
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.939
Hi, Sophie.

698
00:24:18.941 --> 00:24:21.343
Well, hey, it's nice
to meet you ladies.


699
00:24:21.345 --> 00:24:24.312
So, why don't you follow
us and let's get moving?


700
00:24:24.314 --> 00:24:25.347
- Okay.
- Yeah?


701
00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:26.515
- Yeah?
- Let's do it.


702
00:24:26.517 --> 00:24:28.150
- It sounds like so much fun.
- It's gonna be a fun time.


703
00:24:28.152 --> 00:24:29.852
- It's gonna be a fun time.
- Yeah.


704
00:24:32.156 --> 00:24:34.824
(BOTH GIGGLING)

705
00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:37.859
CODY: I'll try not
to drive too fast,


706
00:24:37.861 --> 00:24:39.027
so, you ladies try to keep up.

707
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:40.462
LISA: Drive slow, please,

708
00:24:40.464 --> 00:24:41.396
because I get really
confused on the wrong side.


709
00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:42.397
BRANDON: He goes fast.

710
00:24:42.399 --> 00:24:45.734
- They are so hot.
- I know, tell me about it.


711
00:24:45.736 --> 00:24:46.735
SOPH: If I wasn't
getting married,


712
00:24:46.737 --> 00:24:48.803
girls, I definitely would.

713
00:24:48.805 --> 00:24:49.771
Sophie.

714
00:24:49.773 --> 00:24:51.339
SOPH: Don't worry,
I'll cut that bit out.


715
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:52.876
Matthew, I love you, my baby.

716
00:24:54.344 --> 00:24:57.380
Yeah, I definitely would
not kick them out of bed.


717
00:24:57.382 --> 00:24:58.813
SOPH: Well, it's a
good job you're sleeping


718
00:24:58.815 --> 00:25:00.916
with me tonight then,
because I actually don't


719
00:25:00.918 --> 00:25:02.851
wanna be listening to
that little scenario.


720
00:25:02.853 --> 00:25:04.353
LISA: Oh, unless you
wanna switch with me.


721
00:25:04.355 --> 00:25:06.788
Mm, I'll think about it
and see how the night goes.


722
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.890
Just have to work my charms.

723
00:25:08.892 --> 00:25:10.326
LISA: Oh, you're not
being serious, are you?


724
00:25:10.328 --> 00:25:11.760
About what?

725
00:25:11.762 --> 00:25:12.761
LISA: About sleeping
with the both of them.


726
00:25:12.763 --> 00:25:14.931
Um, don't act all
innocent with me, Ms. Lisa.


727
00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:16.098
Like you've never
done it before.


728
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.333
I knew you was
gonna bring that up.


729
00:25:17.335 --> 00:25:18.868
You know that was
with my ex-boyfriend.


730
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.535
That was a long time ago.

731
00:25:19.537 --> 00:25:20.469
I'm not proud of it.

732
00:25:20.471 --> 00:25:21.938
And you know what I'm
like when I'm drunk.


733
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.939
Excuses, excuses.

734
00:25:22.941 --> 00:25:25.875
Yeah, well I'm on
holiday, so I don't care.


735
00:25:25.877 --> 00:25:27.310
SOPH: You two
are unbelievable.


736
00:25:27.312 --> 00:25:28.978
Aw, thanks, babe.

737
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.514
Love ya.

738
00:25:30.516 --> 00:25:31.515
Watch what you're doing
unless you want us to die.


739
00:25:31.517 --> 00:25:35.452
JESS: Oh, don't be so
overdramatic, will you?


740
00:25:35.454 --> 00:25:37.186
Oh shit, I actually
think I've lost them.


741
00:25:37.188 --> 00:25:38.888
What's the sat map
saying, how far?


742
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.725
SOPH: Not far, about a mile?

743
00:25:46.365 --> 00:25:48.898
BRANDON: You ladies
sure took your time.


744
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.434
If you two hadn't been
such dicks and drove off


745
00:25:50.436 --> 00:25:51.935
and left us on our own, you
wouldn't be still waiting


746
00:25:51.937 --> 00:25:54.004
like two spare pricks
at an orgy, would you?


747
00:25:54.006 --> 00:25:54.972
No, I guess not.

748
00:25:54.974 --> 00:25:56.974
- We apologize right, Brandon?
- Yeah, we do.


749
00:25:56.976 --> 00:25:58.208
Good.

750
00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.810
You'll have some making
up to do then, mister.


751
00:25:59.812 --> 00:26:00.444
I'll look forward to that.

752
00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:01.981
Come on, you guys.

753
00:26:03.015 --> 00:26:03.849
LISA: Hi.

754
00:26:06.185 --> 00:26:08.118
So, I've been
meaning to ask you,


755
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.053
what's with all the filming?

756
00:26:10.055 --> 00:26:12.357
Sophie is a YouTuber.

757
00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:13.857
- Yep.
- Oh, all right.


758
00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:15.859
SOPH: I film everything.

759
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:16.927
I've got a friend
that does that.


760
00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:18.929
Actually makes some pretty
good money at it too.


761
00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:19.863
- Yeah.
- Oh really?


762
00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:20.698
I don't think about the money.

763
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.966
I do it because
I really love it.


764
00:26:22.968 --> 00:26:25.069
Yeah, but you gotta make pretty
good money at it or else...


765
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:26.170
- Oi.
- What?


766
00:26:26.172 --> 00:26:27.538
BRANDON: Or else you
wouldn't be here in LA right?


767
00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.940
SOPH: Yeah, you
can do, I guess.


768
00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:31.042
She's got over two
million subscribers.


769
00:26:31.044 --> 00:26:32.310
- Two million?
- All right.


770
00:26:32.312 --> 00:26:34.281
SOPH: Jess, stop
telling people that.


771
00:26:36.283 --> 00:26:38.383
So, you're famous.

772
00:26:38.385 --> 00:26:41.052
- No, not really.
- Yes, she is.


773
00:26:41.054 --> 00:26:42.320
That's why we're
going to San Fran,


774
00:26:42.322 --> 00:26:45.123
because there's a big
event where all the fans


775
00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:46.991
can meet their
favorite vloggers.


776
00:26:46.993 --> 00:26:47.994
- Ah.
- Jess.


777
00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:50.596
As you can see, she gets
a little bit shy about it.


778
00:26:50.598 --> 00:26:52.065
LISA: Such a whiner.

779
00:26:53.234 --> 00:26:54.067
Enough said.

780
00:26:56.036 --> 00:26:57.436
Can I get your autograph?

781
00:26:57.438 --> 00:26:58.370
Don't you start.

782
00:26:58.372 --> 00:26:59.571
Can you sign something for me?

783
00:26:59.573 --> 00:27:00.905
JESS: You guys are
gonna have to join


784
00:27:00.907 --> 00:27:03.042
that big long queue back there.

785
00:27:03.044 --> 00:27:05.313
BRANDON: All right, I'm in.

786
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:10.115
He's a half-albino.

787
00:27:10.117 --> 00:27:12.084
He's not a full albino.

788
00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:14.553
But you know, most boas are
like gray or black or something,


789
00:27:14.555 --> 00:27:17.356
yeah, and most albinos are
like yellow and white, right?


790
00:27:17.358 --> 00:27:19.258
The little one
keeps looking at me.


791
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.593
SNAKE GUY: She's
not gonna bite you,


792
00:27:20.595 --> 00:27:21.994
she's not gonna bite.

793
00:27:21.996 --> 00:27:23.162
They don't have any
fangs, no venom.


794
00:27:23.164 --> 00:27:25.565
Okay, oh, he's
really looking at me.


795
00:27:25.567 --> 00:27:27.935
He's really looking at me.

796
00:27:29.304 --> 00:27:30.537
One more time.

797
00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:32.605
Okay, here we go,
where's the camera?


798
00:27:32.607 --> 00:27:34.209
We're gonna go...

799
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.178
Guys, so we are on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame.


800
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.046
You can literally see
the stars as I walk.


801
00:27:40.048 --> 00:27:41.214
It's insane here.

802
00:27:41.216 --> 00:27:43.149
It's really,
really, really busy.


803
00:27:43.151 --> 00:27:44.084
Everyone's having a great time.

804
00:27:44.086 --> 00:27:46.319
We've got Batman back there.

805
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:48.054
We've got Spider
-Man.

806
00:27:48.056 --> 00:27:50.090
Oh, some Marvel
character here as well.


807
00:27:50.092 --> 00:27:51.958
Transformers as well.

808
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.161
Everyone but anyone is
here on the Walk of Fame.


809
00:27:55.163 --> 00:27:57.197
Guys, you having fun?

810
00:27:57.199 --> 00:27:58.166
- Sure.
- Yeah.


811
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.969
Try this though,
babe, it is grim.


812
00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:04.070
- What is it?
- I don't know.


813
00:28:04.072 --> 00:28:04.871
- It's absinthe.
- Oh god, no.


814
00:28:04.873 --> 00:28:06.940
Just try it,
it's good for you.


815
00:28:06.942 --> 00:28:08.175
No, thank you.

816
00:28:08.177 --> 00:28:10.313
BRANDON: Yeah, have some.

817
00:28:12.148 --> 00:28:13.381
Oi, oi, girls.

818
00:28:13.383 --> 00:28:15.549
Not a bad price for
a cheeky little spin.


819
00:28:15.551 --> 00:28:16.951
We'll drink.

820
00:28:16.953 --> 00:28:18.652
SOPH: No, Lis,
you just had a drink.


821
00:28:18.654 --> 00:28:19.720
Oh, don't be soft,
just give me some gin,


822
00:28:19.722 --> 00:28:20.554
I mean they're never gonna know.

823
00:28:20.556 --> 00:28:22.356
Oh come on, Sophie.

824
00:28:22.358 --> 00:28:25.261
You only live once, babe,
don't be such a spoil sport.


825
00:28:26.262 --> 00:28:28.697
See, Sophie doesn't have
a bad bone in her body.


826
00:28:28.699 --> 00:28:30.297
She always does the right thing.

827
00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:33.735
SOPH: Oh, is that so, Jess?

828
00:28:33.737 --> 00:28:35.169
Well, what about you guys?

829
00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:36.605
Eh, you girls go ahead.

830
00:28:36.607 --> 00:28:38.038
We've done this already.

831
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.441
- You sure?
- Yeah.


832
00:28:39.443 --> 00:28:41.142
- No worries.
- Yeah, we're positive.


833
00:28:41.144 --> 00:28:42.310
We're gonna get
something to eat here,


834
00:28:42.312 --> 00:28:45.012
hang out, top these off, and
we'll figure out something


835
00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:46.080
when you guys get back.

836
00:28:46.082 --> 00:28:49.251
Well, you heard the
man, girls, let's do this.


837
00:28:49.253 --> 00:28:51.319
Guys, look at this car.

838
00:28:51.321 --> 00:28:53.555
Aw thanks, babe, go
on, you go first.


839
00:28:53.557 --> 00:28:55.724
Yeah, we need to pay as well.

840
00:28:55.726 --> 00:28:58.326
Aw, look at this car, guys,
can you actually believe


841
00:28:58.328 --> 00:28:59.728
we're in Hollywood
riding this car?


842
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.229
Hey, we need to pay.

843
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:03.432
Hope you've got insurance.

844
00:29:03.434 --> 00:29:06.401
- Okay, now where?
- It's really low.


845
00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:08.036
- This way?
- Where we going?


846
00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:09.206
Straight, girls, woo.

847
00:29:10.274 --> 00:29:14.309
Just having a little
cruise in my car, you know?


848
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:15.310
PASSENGER: See,
Hollywood style, ladies.


849
00:29:15.312 --> 00:29:16.412
That's how we do.

850
00:29:16.414 --> 00:29:18.414
- That's how we do.
- That's how we do.


851
00:29:18.416 --> 00:29:20.349
LISA: I feel like
a rapper, you know?


852
00:29:20.351 --> 00:29:22.150
- She feels like a rapper.
- I feel like a rapper.


853
00:29:22.152 --> 00:29:24.052
♪ Versace, Versace,
Medusa head on me ♪


854
00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:29.060
♪ And no one can stop me,
Ferrari, Ferrari, Ferrari ♪


855
00:29:30.295 --> 00:29:31.160
Oh my fuck.

856
00:29:31.162 --> 00:29:34.130
You actually drove
like a boss, babe.


857
00:29:34.132 --> 00:29:35.364
Well, how was it?

858
00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:36.766
JESS: That was
fogging amazing.


859
00:29:36.768 --> 00:29:38.367
Did you take any selfies or?

860
00:29:38.369 --> 00:29:39.469
Of course I did.

861
00:29:39.471 --> 00:29:41.437
Literally something to
cross off the bucket list.


862
00:29:41.439 --> 00:29:42.371
It was so good.

863
00:29:42.373 --> 00:29:43.539
SOPH: Literally, it was one

864
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:45.241
of the coolest things
I've ever done.


865
00:29:45.243 --> 00:29:46.108
You know, I don't think
anything's gonna top that.


866
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.310
- Oh.
- Oh, so good.


867
00:29:47.312 --> 00:29:49.178
So, guys, what's the plan now?

868
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.314
You guys been to
Venice or Santa Monica?


869
00:29:51.316 --> 00:29:52.181
JESS: Yes.

870
00:29:52.183 --> 00:29:53.550
I mean, well, no,
but let's do that.


871
00:29:53.552 --> 00:29:54.585
SOPH: Okay,
yeah, it sounds fun.


872
00:29:54.587 --> 00:29:55.752
How far, how far is it?

873
00:29:55.754 --> 00:29:57.186
It's about 15 miles from here,

874
00:29:57.188 --> 00:29:58.555
but we've been
drinking a little bit


875
00:29:58.557 --> 00:30:00.290
so let's just take an Uber

876
00:30:00.292 --> 00:30:01.391
if that's all right
with you guys.


877
00:30:01.393 --> 00:30:03.293
SOPH: I shouldn't but,
guys, I don't mind driving.


878
00:30:03.295 --> 00:30:05.128
Oo, well it's
gonna be a squeeze.


879
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.064
I have to lie on your lap.

880
00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:07.698
I don't mind.

881
00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.534
(ALL GIGGLING)

882
00:30:10.536 --> 00:30:12.204
- Let's do it.
- Come on then.


883
00:30:13.405 --> 00:30:17.742
Okay, guys, so here
we are on Venice Beach.


884
00:30:17.744 --> 00:30:19.610
We are literally in hippy town.

885
00:30:19.612 --> 00:30:21.345
I mean, just look over here.

886
00:30:21.347 --> 00:30:23.615
There's like a place where
you can actually buy weed.


887
00:30:23.617 --> 00:30:25.215
Apparently, it's legal here.

888
00:30:25.217 --> 00:30:28.085
People are literally
smoking weed on the street.


889
00:30:28.087 --> 00:30:30.187
The only thing that I could
really think this is like


890
00:30:30.189 --> 00:30:34.726
is Camden in London, but
way cooler and by the sea.


891
00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:37.531
Anyway, I think
they've gone ahead.


892
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.810
- Come on, babe, let's go.
- Come on.


893
00:30:51.879 --> 00:30:53.378
Wow.

894
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.382
Soph, tell Matthew bye-bye.

895
00:30:57.517 --> 00:31:00.351
- Sh.
- Yeah, go in there.


896
00:31:00.353 --> 00:31:04.057
SOPH: Sure, thank
you so much, thank you.


897
00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:08.460
- Thank you.
- Got some popcorn?


898
00:31:08.462 --> 00:31:11.297
Okay though, we may
have to cut this bit out.


899
00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:12.398
Matthew cannot see this.

900
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.134
LISA: Never seen anything
like that for my life.


901
00:31:15.136 --> 00:31:16.302
- Oh, we see how it is.
- Hi.


902
00:31:16.304 --> 00:31:17.336
- Hey.
- 'Sup, y'all.


903
00:31:17.338 --> 00:31:18.871
BRANDON: Come on,
Cody, this is ridiculous.


904
00:31:18.873 --> 00:31:19.538
- Are you here all the time?
- Are you real?


905
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.474
Can I touch you?

906
00:31:21.542 --> 00:31:23.809
He's real, he's actually real.

907
00:31:23.811 --> 00:31:25.210
Wow.

908
00:31:25.212 --> 00:31:26.512
I'm not at the table
eating, you know?


909
00:31:26.514 --> 00:31:28.581
- Oh wow.
- I'm out here working out.


910
00:31:28.583 --> 00:31:30.817
LISA: You just eat that
protein, yeah, all day long?


911
00:31:30.819 --> 00:31:32.484
A lot of that, yeah.

912
00:31:32.486 --> 00:31:34.453
A lot of fish, a lot of chicken.

913
00:31:34.455 --> 00:31:35.755
- Damn.
- A lot of hot buns.


914
00:31:35.757 --> 00:31:37.591
- He's got bigger boo...
- Yes, oh my god.


915
00:31:37.593 --> 00:31:39.728
He's actually got
bigger boobs than Jess.


916
00:31:41.897 --> 00:31:47.101
I eat the brunettes
with the zet too, so.


917
00:31:47.803 --> 00:31:49.469
JESS: You know what, guys,

918
00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:50.670
can I just say, are you filming?

919
00:31:50.672 --> 00:31:52.372
Please, just keep filming.

920
00:31:52.374 --> 00:31:53.640
LISA: We're not
gonna miss this.


921
00:31:53.642 --> 00:31:54.674
SOPH: Matthew can do
far better than that.


922
00:31:54.676 --> 00:31:56.576
LISA: Yeah,
sure he can, babe.


923
00:31:56.578 --> 00:31:58.445
Buy yourself something nice.

924
00:31:58.447 --> 00:31:59.512
You've earned it.

925
00:31:59.514 --> 00:32:04.186
Excuse me, take
the dollar, baby.


926
00:32:04.854 --> 00:32:06.754
I got some drinks for us.

927
00:32:06.756 --> 00:32:08.488
- Oh yeah.
- Drinks.


928
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.356
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Cody.


929
00:32:09.358 --> 00:32:10.359
Thank you.

930
00:32:11.593 --> 00:32:14.427
- Cheers, guys.
- Oh my gosh, that's so good.


931
00:32:14.429 --> 00:32:16.631
BRANDON: Thanks,
this is great, awesome.


932
00:32:16.633 --> 00:32:19.767
- Me and you have to trade.
- Yeah, we have to trade.


933
00:32:19.769 --> 00:32:21.902
- Yeah, fuck you guys.
- Put some in here for us.


934
00:32:21.904 --> 00:32:23.304
BRANDON: Yeah, yeah.

935
00:32:23.306 --> 00:32:25.940
CODY: Now you guys
will wanna share.


936
00:32:25.942 --> 00:32:27.775
BRANDON: Yeah, now I'm
gonna fuck you guys up.


937
00:32:27.777 --> 00:32:30.711
With absinthe,

don't think I will.

left, I went into the bathroom

test in the bin.

a lot of guys in Ibiza.

her feel really awkward

00:44:37.627 --> 00:44:40.528
Sure, I mean I still wanna
go if Lisa's up for driving.


1249
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.195
Yeah, I just think I still

1250
00:44:42.197 --> 00:44:44.097
might be a bit too
drunk to drive.

No, you'll be all right,
babe, just take it slow.

take your time.


1253
00:44:46.503 --> 00:44:48.135
I mean, it's really not
that far to San Fran.


1254

We're not in any rush.

1255
00:44:50.306 --> 00:44:52.507
Can you pass me that
water please, babe?


1256
00:44:52.509 --> 00:44:54.175
- We haven't got any, babe.
- Here we are.


1257
00:44:54.177 --> 00:44:58.179
So, before we go, which one
of you put this on the car


1258
00:44:58.181 --> 00:44:59.582
as some sort of joke then?

me, I didn't do that.

Probably just the guys,
a prank or something.

actually find your phone?

No.

be right upset.

Yeah, just sad about all my
photos and numbers and that.

phone to call my dad later?

course you can.

Malibu a miss,

not feeling great.

You can't keep a boyfriend
for longer than a week.


1399
00:49:54.518 --> 00:49:55.718
What did you just say to me?

1400
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.852
I think you heard me, Lisa.

1401
00:49:56.854 --> 00:49:58.988
You have been
winding me up all day.


1402
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.522
- Great.
- Fighting's not gonna help.


1403
00:50:00.524 --> 00:50:01.457
Is it?

1404
00:50:01.459 --> 00:50:02.859
And now my nose is bleeding.

1405
00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:04.894
I didn't mean to hit you
in the face did I, Lisa?


1406
00:50:04.896 --> 00:50:06.896
SOPH: Oh, stop
being dense, shush.


1407
00:50:06.898 --> 00:50:07.831
Honestly.

1408
00:50:07.833 --> 00:50:09.933
We gotta get this sorted out.

1409
00:50:09.935 --> 00:50:10.767
What?

1410
00:50:10.769 --> 00:50:12.001
Stalk someone down.

1411
00:50:12.003 --> 00:50:13.470
I don't know, Soph,
someone's gonna stop.


1412
00:50:13.472 --> 00:50:14.637
We're three girls,
for Christ's sake.


1413
00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:15.972
SOPH: You do know what,
that is not a bad idea, Jess.


1414
00:50:15.974 --> 00:50:17.339
But for now, can you
two just make up?


1415
00:50:17.341 --> 00:50:18.708
'Cause I am so sick and tired

1416
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:20.343
of you both constantly arguing.

1417
00:50:20.345 --> 00:50:21.813
You're ruining
the whole holiday.


1418
00:50:24.616 --> 00:50:26.750
I'm sorry, Soph.

1419
00:50:26.752 --> 00:50:27.951
Sorry, Soph.

1420
00:50:27.953 --> 00:50:29.719
SOPH: Right, okay,
well let's take it


1421
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:31.688
in turns to flag someone down.

1422
00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:32.789
But right now, Jess,
can you hold this?


1423
00:50:32.791 --> 00:50:34.791
I'm gonna go take Lisa
somewhere to clear her nose up.


1424
00:50:34.793 --> 00:50:36.026
JESS: Where are
you gonna do that?


1425
00:50:36.028 --> 00:50:37.761
- There was a restroom.
- I can go on my own.


1426
00:50:37.763 --> 00:50:40.599
SOPH: No, there was a
restroom about half a mile back.


1427
00:50:47.707 --> 00:50:51.542
So, hello to
Sophie's fan group.


1428
00:50:51.544 --> 00:50:55.980
This is Jess and we are
reporting live from the side


1429
00:50:55.982 --> 00:50:58.549
of the road because
we've broken down


1430
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:00.484
and we have a flat tire.

1431
00:51:00.486 --> 00:51:01.719
Awesome.

1432
00:51:01.721 --> 00:51:03.988
But luckily we have
this total babe


1433
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.756
who is helping us fix our tire.

1434
00:51:05.758 --> 00:51:06.991
This is his car.

1435
00:51:06.993 --> 00:51:09.593
The traditional
American Mustang.


1436
00:51:09.595 --> 00:51:11.796
And as you can see, I have
matched myself perfectly


1437
00:51:11.798 --> 00:51:14.598
to the vehicle just
for your own viewing.


1438
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.134
Bit of black and
gold going on here.


1439
00:51:16.136 --> 00:51:18.003
So yeah, pretty much that's it.

1440
00:51:18.005 --> 00:51:20.972
I'm gonna go show you our
little cowboy over here.


1441
00:51:20.974 --> 00:51:22.042
Fixing our tire.

1442
00:51:23.877 --> 00:51:26.377
Well hi there, cowboy,
what's going on?


1443
00:51:26.379 --> 00:51:27.014
Hey, hi.

1444
00:51:28.749 --> 00:51:32.686
JESS: So, we stupidly did
not check for a spare tire.


1445
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:35.587
You know.

1446
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:37.022
COWBOY: Don't worry, you're
not the first to do that.


1447
00:51:37.024 --> 00:51:39.024
JESS: Oh hey, girlies.

1448
00:51:39.026 --> 00:51:40.692
This is the lovely Jake.

1449
00:51:40.694 --> 00:51:41.860
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, how are y'all?


1450
00:51:41.862 --> 00:51:42.894
JESS: He's helping
us fix our tire.


1451
00:51:42.896 --> 00:51:44.396
- Ah.
- We're all good.


1452
00:51:44.398 --> 00:51:45.597
LISA: So it was just
a puncture then, yeah?


1453
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:46.865
JAKE: Sure was.

1454
00:51:46.867 --> 00:51:48.433
You had a few nails
stuck in your tire.


1455
00:51:48.435 --> 00:51:49.501
JESS AND LISA: Nails?

1456
00:51:49.503 --> 00:51:50.702
JAKE: Yeah.

1457
00:51:50.704 --> 00:51:51.904
JESS: How the
hell did that happen?


1458
00:51:51.906 --> 00:51:52.872
Ah, it's a common
thing, really.


1459
00:51:52.874 --> 00:51:54.472
They fall off the back
of trucks and stuff.


1460
00:51:54.474 --> 00:51:55.674
JESS: Really?

1461
00:51:55.676 --> 00:51:56.175
People just come
along and scoop them up.


1462
00:51:56.177 --> 00:51:57.643
It happens.

1463
00:51:57.645 --> 00:51:59.914
God, never heard
of that before.


1464
00:52:01.082 --> 00:52:02.815
- Amazing.
- So, where you girls headed?


1465
00:52:02.817 --> 00:52:04.853
We are going to San Francisco.

1466
00:52:05.954 --> 00:52:07.587
- San Fran, huh?
- Have you been there?


1467
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:08.855
Yep, sure have.

1468
00:52:08.857 --> 00:52:10.823
- I have family in San Fran.
- Really?


1469
00:52:10.825 --> 00:52:12.525
As you can tell, I'm
not from around here.


1470
00:52:12.527 --> 00:52:13.759
LISA: Yeah,
whereabouts you from?


1471
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:16.028
- I'm from Texas.
- Texas, cowboy.


1472
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.197
SOPH: Oh, I love Texas.

1473
00:52:17.199 --> 00:52:18.464
Whereabouts?

1474
00:52:18.466 --> 00:52:19.868
A small town near Austin.

1475
00:52:20.902 --> 00:52:22.102
LISA: Nice.

1476
00:52:22.104 --> 00:52:24.104
JESS: I like The Real
Housewives of Texas.


1477
00:52:24.106 --> 00:52:25.172
So, what you
doing in Cali then,


1478
00:52:25.174 --> 00:52:27.742
apart from helping strange
women with their car?


1479
00:52:28.978 --> 00:52:32.545
Well, I just come out
here for a little road trip


1480
00:52:32.547 --> 00:52:34.513
and picking up some weed.

1481
00:52:34.515 --> 00:52:36.650
- Nice.
- Any of you girls smoke?


1482
00:52:36.652 --> 00:52:38.051
- No, no, thank you.
- Eh.


1483
00:52:38.053 --> 00:52:40.087
You more than me, babe.

1484
00:52:40.089 --> 00:52:41.088
Shouldn't, but I will.

1485
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.089
It's legal here anyway, innit?

1486
00:52:42.091 --> 00:52:43.824
JAKE: Knock yourself out.

1487
00:52:43.826 --> 00:52:44.992
Yeah, it's legal, so why not?

1488
00:52:44.994 --> 00:52:46.860
JAKE: It's all
legal here, ma'am, yes.


1489
00:52:46.862 --> 00:52:48.662
SOPH: Not legal in England.

1490
00:52:48.664 --> 00:52:49.897
Well, it's not the worst place

1491
00:52:49.899 --> 00:52:51.665
in the world to stop, is it?

1492
00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:53.669
I mean, that view is
pretty spectacular.


1493
00:52:54.536 --> 00:52:55.838
Oh, bloody hell.

1494
00:52:58.174 --> 00:52:59.109
Good, huh?

1495
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.109
SOPH: What a rockstar.

1496
00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:02.110
I think we should probably go.

1497
00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:03.577
Do you think so, girls?

1498
00:53:03.579 --> 00:53:05.013
You can keep that,
that's a souvenir.


1499
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.181
Ah, thank you, dude.

1500
00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.016
You're welcome.

1501
00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:09.183
It was nothing.

1502
00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:10.651
Anyway, enjoy your road trip.

1503
00:53:10.653 --> 00:53:11.853
Thank you for your help.

1504
00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.156
- And you, girls.
- Yep, thanks.


1505
00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:26.069
- Aw, check out my souvenir.
- That's cool, very nice.


1506
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.503
So, where you girls staying?

1507
00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:30.672
You scared the hell out of me.

1508
00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:31.839
Didn't mean to scare you.

1509
00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:34.209
Well, we're going
to that motel.


1510
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.977
Oh, I can't remember.

1511
00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.246
Some motel I Googled.

1512
00:53:37.248 --> 00:53:38.780
Just up the road, really.

1513
00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:39.783
A really quick stop.

1514
00:53:40.985 --> 00:53:43.085
All right, girls,
I'll see you around.


1515
00:53:43.087 --> 00:53:46.188
Thanks so much
again, take care.


1516
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:47.189
Aw, bless.

1517
00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:48.123
Where did you find him?

1518
00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:49.258
Did he literally just stop?

1519
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.426
Yeah, I mean, I was just like,

1520
00:53:50.428 --> 00:53:53.028
not long after you guys left,
I was just waggling my legs


1521
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.229
on the road and...

1522
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:55.130
Did you have to
get your tits out or?


1523
00:53:55.132 --> 00:53:56.165
Maybe.

1524
00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:57.299
(JESS GIGGLES)

1525
00:53:57.301 --> 00:53:58.734
Look, I'm sorry for earlier.

1526
00:53:58.736 --> 00:53:59.969
I'm well aware I
was being a dick.


1527
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:01.203
Yeah, babe, I'm really sorry.

1528
00:54:01.205 --> 00:54:03.739
I totally like
went crazy on you.


1529
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:05.241
I'm really sorry.

1530
00:54:05.243 --> 00:54:06.141
Didn't mean to do it.

1531
00:54:06.143 --> 00:54:07.876
LISA: Let's get
rolling then, girls.


1532
00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:10.612
Yeah.

1533
00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:11.847
Bloody hell.

1534
00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:12.848
LISA: Jesus, look
at that rim spin.


1535
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.120
In the red.

1536
00:54:20.125 --> 00:54:22.225
- Only in America, right?
- I know.


1537
00:54:22.227 --> 00:54:25.998
- Looks like an angry car.
- Sounds like an angry car.


1538
00:54:28.233 --> 00:54:33.238
Wow.
(TIRES SCREECHING)


1539
00:54:37.676 --> 00:54:39.843
That guy was weird, wasn't he?

1540
00:54:39.845 --> 00:54:40.677
What?

1541
00:54:40.679 --> 00:54:42.012
He was all right.

1542
00:54:42.014 --> 00:54:43.580
SOPH: Jess, the
guy was a creep.


1543
00:54:43.582 --> 00:54:45.216
Oh my god, you
guys are so soft.


1544
00:54:45.218 --> 00:54:46.049
He was fine.

1545
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:47.684
SOPH: Well then,
why was he asking


1546
00:54:47.686 --> 00:54:48.918
where we were staying then?

1547
00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.321
Well, maybe he wanted
to make conversation


1548
00:54:50.323 --> 00:54:52.223
with you, Sophie, chill.

1549
00:54:52.225 --> 00:54:54.225
I personally think we should
turn around and go back to LA


1550
00:54:54.227 --> 00:54:56.693
'cause today has just
been a nightmare.


1551
00:54:56.695 --> 00:54:58.763
SOPH: Are you
kidding me, Lisa?


1552
00:54:58.765 --> 00:55:00.331
The whole reason why
we've come out here

01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:18.458
SOPH: Jess.

1708
01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.659
Oh my god.

1709
01:00:19.661 --> 01:00:23.463
- Your laugh is so evil.
- It's so, so evil.


1710
01:00:23.465 --> 01:00:25.598
And where do you get all this
energy from all the time?


1711
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.166
You know, I might
invite that cute guy


1712
01:00:27.168 --> 01:00:29.268
from reception over later
for a little nightcap


1713
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.471
and you two lovebirds
crash for the night.


1714
01:00:31.473 --> 01:00:33.072
SOPH: Oo, well if
you wanna do that,


1715
01:00:33.074 --> 01:00:34.006
I'd be quick if I was you.

1716
01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:36.075
I reckon he changes over
for the night shift.


1717
01:00:36.077 --> 01:00:37.243
Good point.

1718
01:00:37.245 --> 01:00:38.444
SOPH: Right, should
we go for a walk


1719
01:00:38.446 --> 01:00:40.079
and leave this little
sleepy head to it?


1720
01:00:40.081 --> 01:00:41.116
JESS: Yeah.

1721
01:00:42.117 --> 01:00:44.117
- See you, girls.
- Bye, little sleepy girl.


1722
01:00:44.119 --> 01:00:46.087
- Bye-bye.
- Night-night.

01:00:57.098 --> 01:00:58.064
I've got a better version.

1728
01:00:58.066 --> 01:00:59.031
SOPH: Oh, of course you do.

1729

Do you even know what that is?

1730
01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:01.268
JESS: No.

1731
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:02.269
It's the national anthem,

1740
01:01:21.558 --> 01:01:23.092
Just so creative.

1741
01:01:24.126 --> 01:01:26.327
So, we are in the
middle of a desert.


1742

Also, it feels like
we've left little miss...

What are you doing?

1744

my best angle, babe.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

1746
01:01:33.203 --> 01:01:35.537
We've left little miss
sleepy head in the motel room


1747
01:01:35.539 --> 01:01:36.438
that this one chose.

1748
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.673
- It's...
- Beautiful.


1749
01:01:38.675 --> 01:01:40.108
Yeah.

1750
01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:41.342
Vintage, original,
gorgeous, five stars.


1751
01:01:41.344 --> 01:01:42.610
I'm not letting you
ever choose again ever.


1752
01:01:42.612 --> 01:01:44.312
Don't thank me too much, guys.

1753
01:01:44.314 --> 01:01:46.247
Look at the mountains,
they're all the way over there.


1754
01:01:46.249 --> 01:01:47.115
These mountains?

1755
01:01:47.117 --> 01:01:50.318
Oh, you're such a
ripping little dog.


1756
01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.354
This is such a cute
little gas station.


1757
01:01:53.356 --> 01:01:55.190
- Sophie.
- Hang on.


1758
01:01:55.192 --> 01:01:57.626
I'm just filming the
gas station, Jess.


1759
01:01:57.628 --> 01:01:59.728
Never get anything
like this in England.


1760
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:03.466
I am, literally smack bang
in the middle of nowhere.


1761
01:02:03.468 --> 01:02:06.737
Sorry about her, she just
loves taking selfies.


1762

You kids and your
fucking cellphones.


1763
01:02:11.242 --> 01:02:12.577
It's the worst generation ever.

1764
01:02:14.645 --> 01:02:16.412
It's ruined so many
damn relationships.


1765
01:02:16.414 --> 01:02:17.248
Ugh.

1766
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:23.185
You know, vanity can
be a cruel mistress.


1767
01:02:23.187 --> 01:02:24.286
- Jess.
- Hey.


1768
01:02:24.288 --> 01:02:25.789
SOPH: Jess,
come on, let's go.


1769
01:02:25.791 --> 01:02:28.224
Matthew and his friends are
gonna be here any minute.


1770
01:02:28.226 --> 01:02:30.392
You look fucking familiar.

1771
01:02:30.394 --> 01:02:31.293
SOPH: Come on, Jess.

1772
01:02:31.295 --> 01:02:32.495
Hey, bitch, you
look fucking familiar.


1773
01:02:32.497 --> 01:02:34.564
- Come on, come on.
- Quick.

ANGRY MAN: Where you going?

1775
01:02:35.467 --> 01:02:36.733
Where you going?

1776
01:02:36.735 --> 01:02:38.401
SOPH: Jess, have
you seen this sink?


1777
01:02:38.403 --> 01:02:40.169
JESS: Yeah, I
know, it's rank innit?


1778
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:40.804
It's gross.

1779
01:02:40.806 --> 01:02:42.339
Look at that plughole.

1780
01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:43.540
They haven't cleaned this
since the last people


1781
01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.375
or the last 10 people.

Do you think it would
be really mean of me


1784
01:02:47.779 --> 01:02:49.312
if I gave them a bad review?

1785
01:02:49.314 --> 01:02:50.814
JESS: No, babe,
they need a bad review.


1786
01:02:50.816 --> 01:02:52.249
They need to turn
this place around.


1787
01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:53.149
It's gross.

1788
01:02:53.151 --> 01:02:54.351
Yeah, it is.

1789
01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:55.719
JESS: Oh, by the way,
you gonna fill me in


1790
01:02:55.721 --> 01:02:57.420
with your little episode
that you had earlier?


1791
01:02:57.422 --> 01:02:59.489
I mean, that guy I
saw you talking to.


1792
01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:00.724
Oh, I dunno who he was.

1793
01:03:00.726 --> 01:03:03.426
Whoever he was, he was
an absolute psycho.


1794
01:03:03.428 --> 01:03:04.862
A psycho?

1795
01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.196
Jesus, Sophie, 
I swear you get

1796
01:03:06.198 --> 01:03:08.498
the weirdest vibes up on guys.

1797
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.433
Jess, you saw the
way he spoke to us.


1798
01:03:10.435 --> 01:03:11.636
He was just staring

1799
01:03:11.638 --> 01:03:13.504
and looking at you
the whole entire time.


1800
01:03:13.506 --> 01:03:14.872
And then when he spoke to me

1801
01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:16.574
and I didn't answer,
he just snapped.


1802
01:03:16.576 --> 01:03:18.275
JESS: Yeah, I guess that
is a bit weird actually.


1803
01:03:18.277 --> 01:03:19.510
What was it he
said to you again?


1804
01:03:19.512 --> 01:03:20.344
Well, it's not
really what he said.


1805
01:03:20.346 --> 01:03:22.413
It's how he said it.

1806
01:03:22.415 --> 01:03:23.648
Wouldn't be surprised
if it was him


1807
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:25.449
who's been creeping us
out this whole time.


1808
01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:26.350
Oh come on.

1809
01:03:26.352 --> 01:03:28.219
I doubt that.

1810
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.755
You're probably just overthinking
things as usual, missy.


1811
01:03:30.757 --> 01:03:33.892
I mean, babe, some people,
they're just like that, you know?


1812
01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.560
They're just a bit weird.

1813
01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.496
And especially around
here, it's full of weirdos.


1814
01:03:38.498 --> 01:03:39.798
You should take it as a
compliment really, babe.


1815
01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.833
I mean, you're hot stuff.

1816
01:03:41.835 --> 01:03:43.501
We're hot stuff.

1817
01:03:43.503 --> 01:03:45.704
And you can't really
blame a guy for staring.


1818
01:03:45.706 --> 01:03:47.438
I mean, just look at me.

1819
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.406
Woo.

1820
01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.908
Jess.

1821
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.310
I don't wanna see that,
nor does the camera.


1822
01:03:52.312 --> 01:03:53.346
JESS: Sure you do.

1823
01:03:54.515 --> 01:03:56.448
No, but I'm being serious.

1824
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.450
I've got some weird
vibe going on now.


1825
01:03:58.452 --> 01:04:01.353
You know what, maybe we
should just move on tonight.


1826
01:04:01.355 --> 01:04:02.254
What?

1827
01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:03.522
You are so silly.

1828
01:04:03.524 --> 01:04:06.458
Honestly, babe,
we're gonna be fine.


1829
01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.392
You're overthinking things.

1830
01:04:07.394 --> 01:04:09.096
You've gone way too much.

1831
01:04:09.897 --> 01:04:11.363
Can I have that towel, please?

1832
01:04:11.365 --> 01:04:12.497
Where is it?

1833
01:04:12.499 --> 01:04:13.866
SOPH: Well, babe, it's
right by the side of you.


1834
01:04:13.868 --> 01:04:15.902
- Oh, sorry.
- That's all right.


1835
01:04:15.904 --> 01:04:17.338
Thanks, Soph.

1836
01:04:19.607 --> 01:04:20.807
Right.

1837
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:22.775
But honestly, babe, we're gonna

1838
01:04:22.777 --> 01:04:25.578
be absolutely fine here, okay?

1839
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.379
We're only here for one night.

1840
01:04:27.381 --> 01:04:28.550
It'll be fine.

1841
01:04:29.951 --> 01:04:30.883
SOPH: Yeah, you're right.

1842
01:04:30.885 --> 01:04:32.485
Of course I'm right.

1843
01:04:32.487 --> 01:04:34.186
Anyway, are you hungry?

1844
01:04:34.188 --> 01:04:35.655
Because I've got the
hungover munchies.


1845
01:04:35.657 --> 01:04:38.625
So, what do you say we go
wake up Lis and get some food?


1846
01:04:38.627 --> 01:04:39.926
SOPH: Oh, I don't think
we should wake her up.


1847
01:04:39.928 --> 01:04:41.461
She's so hungover, Jess.

1848
01:04:41.463 --> 01:04:43.830
Oh yeah, probably
best not to, actually.


1849
01:04:43.832 --> 01:04:44.764
All right, we'll just grab her

1850
01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:46.466
a burger then should we, babe?

1851
01:04:46.468 --> 01:04:47.500
SOPH: Yeah, it shouldn't be
all that far, I don't think.


1852
01:04:47.502 --> 01:04:48.434
Okay, cool.

1853
01:04:48.436 --> 01:04:49.736
I'll get dressed then, we'll go.

1855
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:56.576
Diner it said.

1856
01:04:56.578 --> 01:04:58.846
JESS: Yeah, but
what would Lisa want?


1857
01:04:58.848 --> 01:05:00.513
Can't choose anything.

1858
01:05:00.515 --> 01:05:02.516
JESS: Well, if you say so.

1859
01:05:02.518 --> 01:05:03.819
- Yeah.
- She's so fussy.


1860

What are you gonna get?

1861

Hm, I think I'll go for
the healthy option today.

01:05:09.892 --> 01:05:11.694
- Burger and fries?
- Hm, me too.


1863
01:05:16.499 --> 01:05:19.602
SOPH: Hi, a table
for two, please.


1864
01:05:22.471 --> 01:05:23.504
JESS: Mm.

1865
01:05:23.506 --> 01:05:26.273
SOPH: Oh my god,
babe, you weren't joking.


1866
01:05:26.275 --> 01:05:28.242
You're giving me indigestion
just looking at you.


1867
01:05:28.244 --> 01:05:29.878
The salt is so good.

1868
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.378
Do you want to try some?

1869
01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.647
SOPH: No, oh, I
don't like hot stuff.


1870
01:05:33.649 --> 01:05:35.315
Just Matt then, eh?

1871
01:05:35.317 --> 01:05:36.383
SOPH: Watch it, you.

1872
01:05:36.385 --> 01:05:39.020
You've already had a fight
with one of us today.


1873
01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:39.988
Yeah.

1874
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:42.826
(PHONE VIBRATING)

1875
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.292
Hm.

1876
01:05:45.294 --> 01:05:47.495
The guys just uploaded
a photo of us.


1877
01:05:47.497 --> 01:05:48.732
All hashtag hotties.

1878
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.733
Good one, that.

1879
01:05:51.735 --> 01:05:53.704
- Not a bad pic.
- Not yet.


1880
01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:03.680
- Fuck.
- What?


1881
01:06:05.315 --> 01:06:06.048
Sophie.

1882
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.750
It's that guy from earlier.

1883
01:06:07.752 --> 01:06:09.384
SOPH: Nice try, Jess.

1884
01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:11.321
Sophie, I'm being serious.

1885
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:14.623
SOPH: Where is he?

1886
01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.694
Okay, don't make it obvious.

1887
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:20.665
He's sitting at
the bar behind you.


1888
01:06:24.902 --> 01:06:26.769
SOPH: He's staring
straight at us.


1889
01:06:26.771 --> 01:06:28.738
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1890
01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.005
He's staring right at us.

1891
01:06:30.007 --> 01:06:30.875
SOPH: I mean, I
don't, I wanna go.


1892
01:06:32.877 --> 01:06:33.776
We have to go, we have to go.

1893
01:06:33.778 --> 01:06:35.546
Let's go, let's go.

1894
01:06:40.986 --> 01:06:44.320
- I told you he was a psycho.
- Is he following us?


1895
01:06:44.322 --> 01:06:46.890
- Or was that just coincidence?
- God, I don't know, Jess.


1896
01:06:46.892 --> 01:06:47.824
JESS: For Christ's sake,

1897
01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:49.793
I'm too hungover for
this shit right now.


1898
01:06:49.795 --> 01:06:50.727
Maybe you're just
being paranoid.


1899
01:06:50.729 --> 01:06:51.595
I'm not being paranoid, okay?

1900
01:06:51.597 --> 01:06:53.029
You saw the way he
was looking at us.


1901
01:06:53.031 --> 01:06:54.564
Anyway, he's not
following us now.


1902
01:06:54.566 --> 01:06:55.534
Just turn that off.

1903
01:06:56.769 --> 01:06:59.102
(BOTH PANTING)

1904
01:06:59.104 --> 01:07:00.506
JESS: Inside, Sophie.

1905
01:07:07.579 --> 01:07:09.646
Oh, where the hell
have you two been?


1906
01:07:09.648 --> 01:07:10.814
I am so hungry.

1907
01:07:10.816 --> 01:07:12.417
Can we please get some food?

1908
01:07:13.752 --> 01:07:15.953
What's going on with you two?

1909
01:07:15.955 --> 01:07:17.788
We just went to get some food.

1910
01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:19.023
We thought we'd let you sleep.

1911
01:07:19.025 --> 01:07:20.457
Right.

1912
01:07:20.459 --> 01:07:21.895
Why are you both
out of breath for?


1913
01:07:24.429 --> 01:07:27.799
Well earlier, when we
were at the gas station,


1914
01:07:27.801 --> 01:07:31.135
this guy was just standing
there, staring at Jess.


1915
01:07:31.137 --> 01:07:34.138
And then when he spoke to me,
I didn't speak to him back.


1916
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.940
He just snapped at me.

1917
01:07:35.942 --> 01:07:39.911
That same guy, he was just
in the diner we were in.


1918
01:07:39.913 --> 01:07:41.879
JESS: I told her she's
just being paranoid.


1919
01:07:41.881 --> 01:07:43.848
I'm not being
paranoid okay, Jess?


1920
01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:45.082
All right, babe, look.

1921
01:07:45.084 --> 01:07:46.083
I'm sure it's nothing.

1922
01:07:46.085 --> 01:07:47.087
Don't worry.

1923
01:07:50.157 --> 01:07:51.990
Oh, and cheers by the way

1924
01:07:51.992 --> 01:07:54.828
for trying to shit
me up earlier, Jess.


1925
01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:56.995
JESS: What are you on about?

1926
01:07:56.997 --> 01:07:58.596
You know, I've heard
your little ghost story.


1927
01:07:58.598 --> 01:08:00.631
I'm not that gullible, girls.

1928
01:08:00.633 --> 01:08:01.501
What is it?

1929
01:08:04.738 --> 01:08:07.473
Jess trying to
shit me up with this.


1930
01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.510
JESS: I didn't do that, Lis.

1931
01:08:11.512 --> 01:08:14.415
LISA: You are such a
bad liar, Jess, I swear.


1932
01:08:17.651 --> 01:08:18.819
SOPH: Look.

1933
01:08:20.988 --> 01:08:22.554
LISA: What?

1934
01:08:22.556 --> 01:08:24.458
SOPH: That's the
note from the car.


1935
01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:26.727
Shit.

1936
01:08:27.996 --> 01:08:29.195
I forgot about that.

1937
01:08:29.197 --> 01:08:30.596
JESS: Who the
fuck would follow us


1938
01:08:30.598 --> 01:08:32.000
all the way here to do that?

1939
01:08:34.803 --> 01:08:37.003
All right, I'm gonna
go to reception


1940
01:08:37.005 --> 01:08:38.171
and just check who
else is staying here.


1941
01:08:38.173 --> 01:08:40.106
Just, I'll be right back, okay?

1942
01:08:40.108 --> 01:08:41.074
Soph?

1943
01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:43.676
I didn't hear anything
like cars or anything.


1944
01:08:43.678 --> 01:08:46.014
JESS: I'll be right back.

1945
01:08:48.717 --> 01:08:49.883
SOPH: Where did you find it?

1946
01:08:49.885 --> 01:08:51.684
I literally just
woke up to use the lieu


1947
01:08:51.686 --> 01:08:54.554
and it was just lying
down there on the mat.


1948
01:08:54.556 --> 01:08:57.690
SOPH: What, like someone
maybe dropped it by mistake?


1949
01:08:57.692 --> 01:08:59.628
Doesn't look like a
mistake though, does it?


1950
01:09:00.996 --> 01:09:01.928
And?

1951
01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:03.529
No, there's no one there.

1952
01:09:03.531 --> 01:09:05.899
Just this note that says
he's been called away


1953
01:09:05.901 --> 01:09:06.866
on a family emergency.

1954
01:09:06.868 --> 01:09:07.800
LISA: Another fucking note?

1955
01:09:07.802 --> 01:09:08.637
Let me see.

1956
01:09:09.804 --> 01:09:10.639
Fuck's sake.

1957
01:09:13.009 --> 01:09:13.874
I don't know,
Sophie, maybe it's one


1958
01:09:13.876 --> 01:09:15.743
of your crazy ass
fans or something.


1959
01:09:15.745 --> 01:09:18.812
SOPH: Yeah, but if it
is, it's a pretty sick joke.


1960
01:09:18.814 --> 01:09:20.814
Yeah, exactly, let's
not freak out about this.


1961
01:09:20.816 --> 01:09:22.082
Like, let's think
about it logically.


1962
01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:24.151
Those YouTube prank videos,

1963
01:09:24.153 --> 01:09:26.954
they're proper
popular at the moment.


1964
01:09:26.956 --> 01:09:28.756
What about that guy that
changed our tire earlier?


1965
01:09:28.758 --> 01:09:29.957
Like, he was weird.

1966
01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:30.891
JESS: You've
gotta be kidding me.


1967
01:09:30.893 --> 01:09:32.660
Now we've got another suspect.

1968
01:09:32.662 --> 01:09:35.196
I don't know, it's just
we got another puncture.


1969
01:09:35.198 --> 01:09:36.697
That shit happens twice,

1970
01:09:36.699 --> 01:09:38.799
it's just too much
of a coincidence.


1971
01:09:38.801 --> 01:09:40.201
Girls, at first,
honestly, I was scared.


1972
01:09:40.203 --> 01:09:43.204
But now, like, come
on, this is ridiculous.


1973
01:09:43.206 --> 01:09:45.140
It's gotta be a prank,
girls, it's just gotta be.


1974
01:09:45.142 --> 01:09:47.641
Let's not freak out over
some stupid written notes like.


1975
01:09:47.643 --> 01:09:50.178
(PHONE VIBRATING)
We've had a fucked up day.


1976
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.012
We're all tired.

1977
01:09:51.014 --> 01:09:52.646
Let's just get a
good night's sleep


1978
01:09:52.648 --> 01:09:53.647
and we'll deal with
the puncture tomorrow


1979
01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:55.250
before San Fran, yeah?

1980
01:09:55.252 --> 01:09:57.085
SOPH: Okay.

1981
01:09:57.087 --> 01:09:58.221
- Lisa?
- Yeah?


1982
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:01.923
What the fuck is this?

1983
01:10:01.925 --> 01:10:03.093
LISA: What?

1984
01:10:05.629 --> 01:10:07.062
You bitch.

1985
01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:08.632
LISA: Excuse me?

1986
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.700
You dirty fucking bitch.

1987
01:10:11.702 --> 01:10:14.069
- What?
- What the hell, Jess?


1988
01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:16.207
- Check my timeline.
- What is it?


1989
01:10:18.909 --> 01:10:22.111
So, when were you gonna
tell me you fucked Ryan then?


1990
01:10:22.113 --> 01:10:24.013
- What, I didn't?
- You didn't?


1991
01:10:24.015 --> 01:10:26.581
You are so full of shit.

1992
01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:28.117
- I didn't.
- Someone's posted a picture


1993
01:10:28.119 --> 01:10:29.251
of you and Ryan in
bed together on...


1994
01:10:29.253 --> 01:10:30.186
I didn't do it.

1995
01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:32.021
Don't fucking lie to me, Lisa.

1996
01:10:32.023 --> 01:10:34.156
- Fuck.
- Just tell her, Lis.


1997
01:10:34.158 --> 01:10:35.157
How could you do that to me?

1998
01:10:35.159 --> 01:10:36.559
You knew how much I loved him.

1999
01:10:36.561 --> 01:10:37.793
I swear, you
need to believe me


2000
01:10:37.795 --> 01:10:39.195
that it wasn't even
fucking like that.


2001
01:10:39.197 --> 01:10:41.197
Look, I wanted to tell
you, but it just...


2002
01:10:41.199 --> 01:10:42.767
- How many times then?
- What?


2003
01:10:43.801 --> 01:10:45.167
Say what one more time,

2004
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:47.169
I swear, I'll rip your
fucking eyes out, Lisa.


2005
01:10:47.171 --> 01:10:48.637
How many times?

2006
01:10:48.639 --> 01:10:50.307
I swear to you, it
wasn't even like that.


2007
01:10:50.309 --> 01:10:52.808
Like he was chatting shit to
me when we were in the club


2008
01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:54.077
and I know I shouldn't
have said anything


2009
01:10:54.079 --> 01:10:55.845
- but it was just...
- No no no no no no.


2010
01:10:55.847 --> 01:10:57.114
No no no.

2011
01:10:57.116 --> 01:10:58.315
Of all the guys you
could have slept you,


2012
01:10:58.317 --> 01:11:00.350
you chose to sleep with Ryan?

2013
01:11:00.352 --> 01:11:02.651
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Lisa?


2014
01:11:02.653 --> 01:11:05.590
I'm supposed to be
your best friend.


2015
01:11:07.126 --> 01:11:08.193
