1
00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:58.376
We don't have to do it straight away.

2
00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:00.047
Don't you want to?

3
00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:02.185
Sure, but...

4
00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:38.885
The sheet's pinning me down.

5
00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:40.285
Oh, sorry.

6
00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:07.870
You know, Diane...

7
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.020
I think you're beautiful.

8
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.374
Is everything okay?

9
00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:15.727
Yeah, but I don't want to talk.

10
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:17.255
Okay, sorry.

11
00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:19.067
Can you put on some music?

12
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:21.406
Sorry, my player's bust.

13
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.277
Stop saying sorry.

14
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:23.337
Oh, sorry.

15
00:02:57.152 --> 00:02:59.262
I don't think I
want to do it anymore.

16
00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:15.380
You could knock.

17
00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.419
What are you up to?

18
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.535
Watching TV.

19
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.047
I came to say goodnight.

20
00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:38.034
Turn that off.

21
00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:40.779
Good night.

22
00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:12.376
...to express a negative similarity.

23
00:07:13.103 --> 00:07:14.765
I did it this weekend.

24
00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:16.751
- Yeah, right.
- Don't you believe me?


25
00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:19.046
I swear...

26
00:07:19.076 --> 00:07:22.953
- What's it like when it goes in?
- It's really scary because...


27
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.836
If I said, for example: "I don't like pupils
drawing during my lesson," What would you reply?


28
00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:30.235
It's too bad.

29
00:07:31.058 --> 00:07:32.865
In the context of this lesson?

30
00:07:34.578 --> 00:07:35.498
Good.

31
00:07:36.502 --> 00:07:39.432
Copy what's on the board,
then I'll give you other examples.


32
00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:40.540
And his mother?

33
00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:43.540
She's a painter, she's cool.

34
00:07:43.807 --> 00:07:45.564
But it was during the day.

35
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.905
I closed my eyes.
We couldn't close the shutters,


36
00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:50.919
- or she'd have guessed
what we were doing.


37
00:07:50.943 --> 00:07:52.370
I was really embarrassed.

38
00:07:52.394 --> 00:07:53.701
Did it hurt?

39
00:07:53.725 --> 00:07:55.674
Yeah, a bit, if you think about it.

40
00:07:55.698 --> 00:07:58.462
He told me that you don't
feel any pleasure the first time.


41
00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:00.745
No pleasure the first time...

42
00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:01.723
Mind your own business.

43
00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:04.267
What are you talking about?
Say it out loud.


44
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:06.211
Frank, do you want to give
the lesson instead of me?


45
00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:07.114
Can I?

46
00:08:07.138 --> 00:08:07.928
No!

47
00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:14.585
Right, get out.

48
00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:32.672
Go on, Gilles!
That's it.


49
00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:35.858
Go on, quick.
There was nobody up front.


50
00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:37.752
Nice try.
Not bad.


51
00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.508
Okay, guys,
move over for the girls.


52
00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:46.081
C'mon, Frank!

53
00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:51.424
Enough! Are you a girl?
No, you're not.


54
00:08:52.963 --> 00:08:55.118
Casper and Gilles,
stay in the goals.


55
00:08:55.442 --> 00:08:57.030
You'll be keepers for the girls, okay?

56
00:08:57.054 --> 00:08:58.059
No!

57
00:08:58.083 --> 00:08:58.899
Oh, yes!

58
00:08:58.923 --> 00:09:01.750
You wanted to play more,
you've got it.


59
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.811
Ready, girls?
Off we go!


60
00:09:08.376 --> 00:09:09.738
Not bad at all.

61
00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.107
Go for it!

62
00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:14.453
It doesn't matter, play on!

63
00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:17.249
It wasn't done on purpose.
Play on.


64
00:09:23.535 --> 00:09:25.539
Diane!
What're you doing?


65
00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:31.587
Everything okay, girls?

66
00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:36.069
Strange smell...

67
00:09:36.093 --> 00:09:38.449
- Always the same ones.
- It smells of sweat...


68
00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:42.370
The door was open!

69
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.240
Want to touch?

70
00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:50.534
Diane.

71
00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:51.733
Coming.

72
00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.647
Oops, he's gonna
wait outside for her!


73
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:56.550
- Hurry up, Diane.
- He's waiting for you!


74
00:09:56.574 --> 00:09:57.914
How sweet!

75
00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:19.540
Have you watched films?

76
00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:22.010
Porn?

77
00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:23.833
Uh... no.

78
00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:25.359
Why'd you ask?

79
00:10:25.383 --> 00:10:26.793
No reason.

80
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.257
I've gotta go.

81
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:35.125
No, stay.
We haven't even eaten.


82
00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:36.769
I'm not hungry.

83
00:10:38.223 --> 00:10:40.356
Please stay.

84
00:12:00.998 --> 00:12:04.736
- Eat that half.
- Don't want to. I'm not hungry.


85
00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:06.820
Not for that, anyway.

86
00:12:08.285 --> 00:12:10.251
Antoine rang.

87
00:12:10.275 --> 00:12:11.269
Who's Antoine?

88
00:12:11.293 --> 00:12:14.594
The little guy from hockey,
with a scooter?


89
00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:15.809
You think he's small?

90
00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:17.347
I didn't mean anything.

91
00:12:17.426 --> 00:12:18.471
What did he want?

92
00:12:18.753 --> 00:12:21.399
It was for a party.
I don't know where.


93
00:12:21.423 --> 00:12:22.800
Sounds good, huh?

94
00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:25.390
There's a party at
Marie's on Saturday.


95
00:12:25.594 --> 00:12:26.645
Are you going?

96
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:27.923
Yes.

97
00:12:29.494 --> 00:12:32.303
If I could, I'd go out every evening.

98
00:12:32.363 --> 00:12:33.221
Oh yeah?

99
00:12:33.245 --> 00:12:34.080
Silly boy.

100
00:12:34.104 --> 00:12:36.437
- Where would you go, clever clogs?
- To party?


101
00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.006
I'll go.

102
00:12:43.136 --> 00:12:45.160
There's a girl outside.

103
00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.057
- Hello.
- Hello.


104
00:12:50.552 --> 00:12:51.923
Sorry to disturb you.

105
00:12:54.924 --> 00:12:57.446
It's okay, we've finished eating.

106
00:12:57.884 --> 00:13:00.692
My mother was wondering
if you know a piano teacher.


107
00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:03.407
We live round here,
we've just moved in.


108
00:13:04.086 --> 00:13:06.029
We can ask around.

109
00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:09.266
We live next door.

110
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.640
My name's Julia.

111
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:11.568
Cool...

112
00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:17.180
I'm Christian...
my daughter, Diane, and Marc.


113
00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:20.919
Hi. I think I've already seen you.

114
00:13:20.943 --> 00:13:22.640
Wasn't that you in the window?

115
00:13:22.664 --> 00:13:23.703
No.

116
00:13:23.727 --> 00:13:25.986
No?

117
00:13:26.587 --> 00:13:27.970
Something to drink?

118
00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:29.302
No, thanks.

119
00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:30.263
A dessert?

120
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:32.385
- No, I have to be going.
- No? Sure?


121
00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:36.864
Okay, then. We'll ask around,
see what we find.


122
00:13:37.243 --> 00:13:38.685
- See you soon.
- Bye.


123
00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:40.403
Here.

124
00:13:43.437 --> 00:13:45.536
We have a new neighbour.

125
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.625
Seems nice, doesn't she?

126
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.324
Finish your pasta.
- I'm not hungry. It disgusts me.


127
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.514
- Hi.
- Hi.


128
00:14:37.765 --> 00:14:39.725
I've got the number
of a piano teacher.


129
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:41.982
I don't give a shit about the piano.

130
00:14:42.124 --> 00:14:44.572
I just wanted a closer look
at the girl spying on me.


131
00:14:44.596 --> 00:14:45.703
I'm not spying.

132
00:14:45.727 --> 00:14:47.026
Yeah, right.

133
00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:51.976
- Come here.
- Let go.


134
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.009
Come here, you'll get run over.

135
00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:04.717
Stop it.

136
00:15:08.425 --> 00:15:09.808
- Julia?
- Yes?


137
00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:11.531
There's a party Saturday.
Want to come?


138
00:15:11.555 --> 00:15:12.722
With you?

139
00:15:13.314 --> 00:15:15.176
Yeah. Come and get me.

140
00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:18.371
- Bye.
- Bye.


141
00:15:19.165 --> 00:15:20.511
"There's a party Saturday.
Want to come?"


142
00:15:20.535 --> 00:15:21.741
- Stop it.
- "Stop it."


143
00:15:21.765 --> 00:15:23.241
- Be quiet.
- "Be quiet."


144
00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:25.014
- You're a pain.
- "You're a pain."


145
00:16:06.495 --> 00:16:07.477
Dad?

146
00:16:08.173 --> 00:16:09.725
- Dad?
- What're you doing?


147
00:16:11.015 --> 00:16:11.912
Yes?

148
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:13.083
Is this sweater okay?

149
00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:15.037
Nice. Very nice.

150
00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:18.830
- Forget it.
- What did I say?


151
00:16:18.854 --> 00:16:21.064
- Bye. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.


152
00:16:21.927 --> 00:16:23.496
Have fun.

153
00:17:09.535 --> 00:17:11.059
- Hi.
- Hi.


154
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.869
Do you like this group?

155
00:17:15.045 --> 00:17:17.427
I saw them in concert.
They're wild.


156
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.812
I told my parents I'd
be sleeping in your place.


157
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:30.088
Okay.

158
00:17:30.112 --> 00:17:31.628
They'll be less of a pain.

159
00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:46.516
Nice sweater.

160
00:17:47.716 --> 00:17:48.735
Thanks.

161
00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:59.321
- Going to get made-up?
- No.


162
00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.788
I'd wear it all
the time, if I could.

163
00:18:02.812 --> 00:18:06.590
- Sure you don't want to?
- No, I'd rather stay like this.


164
00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:11.379
My hands are slippy.
Could you open this?


165
00:18:14.264 --> 00:18:15.427
Thanks.

166
00:18:23.465 --> 00:18:25.074
Julia, you ready?

167
00:18:25.283 --> 00:18:27.516
Hello. Diane, right?

168
00:18:27.783 --> 00:18:29.789
Hurry up.
We must go now.


169
00:18:29.813 --> 00:18:30.977
Take this.

170
00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:35.117
- 14 ends with 4.
- Seen any clean glasses?


171
00:18:37.532 --> 00:18:41.032
You say "apple" for 4
and "strawberry" for 7.


172
00:18:41.056 --> 00:18:42.121
Okay.

173
00:18:42.145 --> 00:18:44.089
Right, then.

174
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.898
- ...4!
- No! How hard can it be?


175
00:18:46.922 --> 00:18:48.196
Any white wine?

176
00:18:48.803 --> 00:18:51.043
When I say 1, you say 2,

177
00:18:51.337 --> 00:18:53.545
- you say 3, I say "apple".
Then at 7...


178
00:18:58.718 --> 00:18:59.697
Antoine!

179
00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:01.065
Hi, how are you?

180
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:03.639
Coming. I'll just finish this.

181
00:19:18.009 --> 00:19:19.623
Okay?
Wanna smoke?


182
00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:20.195
No.

183
00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:21.219
- Come on!
- No!


184
00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:23.233
- Come on. Please.
- I don't want to.


185
00:19:23.257 --> 00:19:25.669
- I want to smoke with you.
- I don't want to.


186
00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.084
Sorry.

187
00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:48.448
Have you seen a girl with brown hair,
down to here?


188
00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:49.923
No.

189
00:19:58.032 --> 00:19:59.288
Seen the brunette I came with?

190
00:19:59.506 --> 00:20:00.036
Who?

191
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.496
The brunette I came with.

192
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.782
No, sorry.

193
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.570
I looked all over for you.

194
00:20:11.781 --> 00:20:13.102
I'm here.

195
00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:15.541
- Coming home?
- No, we're going out.


196
00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:19.260
- Enjoying yourself? Lousy party.
- Yeah.


197
00:20:20.537 --> 00:20:21.448
Shall I come with you?

198
00:20:21.658 --> 00:20:23.126
Sure, you're my alibi.

199
00:20:23.558 --> 00:20:24.604
Hurry!

200
00:20:26.602 --> 00:20:28.712
You can come,
but you do as I say.


201
00:20:29.574 --> 00:20:31.762
Don't stop me from
doing what I want.


202
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:34.489
Come on.

203
00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:40.414
We're going for a drive.
Get in.


204
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:42.322
Does your friend speak English too?

205
00:20:47.342 --> 00:20:48.931
It's Diane, she's shy.

206
00:20:49.461 --> 00:20:50.645
C'mon, get in.

207
00:20:52.624 --> 00:20:55.322
Don't worry,
we'll soon loosen up your friend.


208
00:20:58.326 --> 00:20:59.326
You're not alone.

209
00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:06.792
Go for it!

210
00:21:27.879 --> 00:21:32.062
Hey, man, drop it.

211
00:21:32.062 --> 00:21:32.905
Drop it!

212
00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.835
That's enough.
Go somewhere else to do that.


213
00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:38.554
If you're not happy, get out.

214
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.925
Fuck this!

215
00:22:08.897 --> 00:22:11.524
Carry on. Don't stop.

216
00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:17.811
Relax.

217
00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:20.189
Stop, please!

218
00:22:20.496 --> 00:22:22.909
You shittin' me!
You speak French!


219
00:22:23.889 --> 00:22:25.945
- C'mon, kiss me!
- Let go of me!


220
00:22:27.056 --> 00:22:27.864
It's okay.

221
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.758
Let go of her!

222
00:22:29.782 --> 00:22:32.154
Let go of her!
Let her go!


223
00:22:35.219 --> 00:22:36.948
Stupid pricks!

224
00:22:39.773 --> 00:22:40.805
What did you do?

225
00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:43.539
Jerks!

226
00:22:46.887 --> 00:22:48.499
Motherfuckers!

227
00:22:48.873 --> 00:22:50.510
Bastards!

228
00:22:58.932 --> 00:23:01.132
It's okay, they didn't see us.

229
00:23:02.975 --> 00:23:04.989
We still had a good time, huh?

230
00:23:05.203 --> 00:23:08.053
Even if it wasn't great at first,
it got better after.


231
00:23:08.077 --> 00:23:10.802
Then it got bad 'cos
they were jerks, but...


232
00:23:12.386 --> 00:23:14.607
Your face okay?
Let me see.


233
00:23:14.631 --> 00:23:16.584
You're white as a sheet.

234
00:23:32.547 --> 00:23:36.283
I hate this place.
I bet we can't find a taxi.


235
00:23:40.312 --> 00:23:41.857
Move!

236
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.813
- Shall I sleep with you?
- Yeah, you can sleep with me.


237
00:23:57.547 --> 00:23:59.669
You know it'll happen one day?

238
00:24:01.624 --> 00:24:03.526
You can't avoid it.

239
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.358
Everything else, but not that.

240
00:24:10.707 --> 00:24:11.933
'Night.

241
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.306
Marc, stop playing.

242
00:24:55.022 --> 00:24:56.642
Marc, you hear me?

243
00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:59.273
- What?
- Stop playing.


244
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.506
No!

245
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.869
- Stop playing, please.
- No!


246
00:25:03.893 --> 00:25:05.178
Stop!

247
00:25:07.393 --> 00:25:08.651
Thank you.

248
00:25:31.574 --> 00:25:32.474
Julia!

249
00:25:33.335 --> 00:25:34.281
Julia!

250
00:25:34.305 --> 00:25:37.222
- What're you doing?
- Looking after my brother. You?


251
00:25:37.385 --> 00:25:40.366
I'm stuck here.
Turn it up!


252
00:25:45.046 --> 00:25:47.146
- Louder, I can't hear.
- What?


253
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.667
Louder!

254
00:26:05.935 --> 00:26:08.042
I'll play something for you.

255
00:26:13.686 --> 00:26:15.049
I can't hear!

256
00:26:40.214 --> 00:26:41.364
Julia!

257
00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:43.451
That's quite enough!

258
00:27:03.725 --> 00:27:05.745
Off the pitch quick, guys!

259
00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:09.333
Don't forget the cones.

260
00:27:09.658 --> 00:27:12.467
Keepers, put your stuff in the goals.

261
00:27:12.491 --> 00:27:14.251
I'll get my stuff.
You go.


262
00:27:14.275 --> 00:27:15.840
- You're sure?
- Yes.


263
00:27:16.352 --> 00:27:18.006
See you in a bit.

264
00:27:25.637 --> 00:27:26.947
Are you in love?

265
00:27:27.623 --> 00:27:29.464
Don't be silly.

266
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.291
Gonna try get her into bed?

267
00:27:32.337 --> 00:27:35.065
Drop it.
She's just a friend.


268
00:27:35.415 --> 00:27:38.854
I don't give a damn. We're not going out.
Do as you please.


269
00:27:39.578 --> 00:27:41.867
Why?
Does it piss you off?


270
00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:43.544
Guys, she's naked!
Come! Come!


271
00:28:48.813 --> 00:28:50.286
Diane, what the hell are you doing?

272
00:28:51.448 --> 00:28:53.342
Who cares?
She wants to be naked.


273
00:28:53.366 --> 00:28:54.604
Beat it, beat it!

274
00:28:56.494 --> 00:28:57.533
So, Diane...

275
00:28:58.376 --> 00:28:59.576
Want a kiss, right?

276
00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:02.646
What's going on here?

277
00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:04.165
Come on, back to your pals.

278
00:29:04.675 --> 00:29:05.431
Leave her alone, Frank.

279
00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:06.640
Take it easy, Coach.

280
00:29:06.737 --> 00:29:07.641
Get out!

281
00:29:08.908 --> 00:29:11.064
What's gotten into you, Diane?
Are you mad?


282
00:29:11.944 --> 00:29:14.480
Come, cover yourself up. Come on.

283
00:29:23.156 --> 00:29:25.200
Do you think I'm pretty?

284
00:29:25.538 --> 00:29:25.944
What?

285
00:29:25.968 --> 00:29:27.634
Do you think I'm pretty?

286
00:29:27.688 --> 00:29:28.979
Of course.

287
00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:31.567
Today, do you think I'm pretty?

288
00:29:32.772 --> 00:29:33.768
What do you mean?

289
00:29:34.871 --> 00:29:36.818
Why do you think I'm pretty, now?

290
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:41.015
Not just now... I've always thought
you pretty. You're my daughter.


291
00:29:41.928 --> 00:29:43.791
- What more can I say?
- Stop.


292
00:29:45.992 --> 00:29:48.745
Would you... Do you...
Do you think I'm sexy?


293
00:29:49.544 --> 00:29:50.216
What?

294
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.226
Would you like to sleep with me?

295
00:29:52.596 --> 00:29:54.664
Diane, that's crazy.
I'm your father!


296
00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:01.488
Diane...

297
00:30:02.637 --> 00:30:03.786
I'm your father...

298
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.917
It doesn't matter.
Drop me here.


299
00:30:06.023 --> 00:30:06.918
- What?
- Stop!


300
00:30:07.887 --> 00:30:10.687
- I'd rather walk. Stop!
- Wait. You must understand...


301
00:30:10.711 --> 00:30:15.036
It's a difficult question to answer.
Don't get cross. Come back, Diane!


302
00:31:08.495 --> 00:31:11.313
My father's a jerk
and I hate my mother!


303
00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:15.957
- You're lucky, your Dad's adorable.
- It's not the same.


304
00:31:15.981 --> 00:31:18.839
I can tell he loves you.
He lets you do what you want.


305
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.540
I think...
Do you think he finds me beautiful?


306
00:31:24.301 --> 00:31:25.520
Dunno.

307
00:31:25.584 --> 00:31:28.856
Have you seen how he looks at me?
I'm sure he likes youngsters.


308
00:32:13.992 --> 00:32:16.054
Have you packed your case?

309
00:32:16.427 --> 00:32:17.520
Yep.

310
00:32:24.193 --> 00:32:26.222
I'll only be gone two days, Dad.

311
00:32:27.229 --> 00:32:28.426
You'll get by.

312
00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:30.690
What'll I do without my girl?

313
00:32:31.486 --> 00:32:32.965
Poor Dad.

314
00:32:38.236 --> 00:32:40.452
Right. Good night.

315
00:32:41.575 --> 00:32:42.593
Good night.

316
00:32:44.404 --> 00:32:46.393
He walks in the fields-

317
00:32:46.457 --> 00:32:50.770
- back and forth,
it's his work of art, ephemeral art.


318
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.757
It's fascinating.
Sometimes he walks in a circle.


319
00:32:55.865 --> 00:32:58.176
He walks in a circle...

320
00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:01.221
...one way, then the other...

321
00:33:01.618 --> 00:33:02.500
...It's his...

322
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:09.384
Are you okay?
Are you sure?


323
00:33:11.093 --> 00:33:12.477
Must be the nuts.

324
00:33:13.256 --> 00:33:13.810
Some water?

325
00:33:13.914 --> 00:33:15.426
No, that's fizzy.

326
00:33:15.895 --> 00:33:17.974
- Got any...?
- It's kind of you, thanks.


327
00:33:22.966 --> 00:33:24.089
Sorry.

328
00:33:26.066 --> 00:33:27.881
Shall I come with you?

329
00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:34.275
You've got the keys.

330
00:33:34.299 --> 00:33:35.817
Yes, I'm coming.

331
00:33:45.354 --> 00:33:47.856
Don't stay up too late.
Good night, Julia.


332
00:33:48.567 --> 00:33:51.467
I'm counting on you.
Take care of her.


333
00:33:51.893 --> 00:33:54.140
Good night, girls.
See you tomorrow.


334
00:33:59.957 --> 00:34:01.053
Drink?

335
00:34:02.621 --> 00:34:04.022
We're not allowed.

336
00:34:04.046 --> 00:34:06.897
'Course we can.
We deserve it.


337
00:34:18.262 --> 00:34:19.933
- Hello.
- Hello.


338
00:34:20.366 --> 00:34:22.879
Two shots of vodka, please.

339
00:34:22.942 --> 00:34:24.711
Do you have your parents' permission?

340
00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:25.850
Very funny.

341
00:34:31.108 --> 00:34:32.073
Cheers.

342
00:34:39.135 --> 00:34:40.520
Bottoms up.

343
00:34:44.693 --> 00:34:46.439
It's too strong!

344
00:34:53.812 --> 00:34:55.075
Another?

345
00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.939
Right.

346
00:35:01.977 --> 00:35:03.194
- Coming?
- Yes.


347
00:35:03.272 --> 00:35:05.463
It wasn't like he'd said.

348
00:35:05.487 --> 00:35:09.050
Then when we got there,
we needed a credit card.


349
00:35:09.135 --> 00:35:12.233
We were with this guy
and he continued ranting on...


350
00:35:12.302 --> 00:35:13.972
- Hey!
- Everything okay?


351
00:35:13.996 --> 00:35:15.686
- I'll take over now.
- Okay. Great.


352
00:35:16.716 --> 00:35:19.662
Well... my shift is over, girls.

353
00:35:19.686 --> 00:35:21.144
So, have a good evening.

354
00:35:21.168 --> 00:35:22.686
427.

355
00:35:23.456 --> 00:35:24.231
Pardon?

356
00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.069
427.

357
00:35:26.252 --> 00:35:27.609
What...?

358
00:35:27.633 --> 00:35:29.297
See you later.

359
00:35:32.774 --> 00:35:34.338
I don't think it's a good idea.

360
00:35:34.362 --> 00:35:36.450
Sure it is. C'mon.

361
00:35:37.895 --> 00:35:39.745
You're over 18?

362
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.034
Okay, I'll get changed
and be right back.


363
00:35:48.316 --> 00:35:50.343
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to. I don't fancy him.


364
00:35:50.367 --> 00:35:52.441
You're just scared.

365
00:35:52.868 --> 00:35:54.520
I want to have fun.

366
00:35:54.647 --> 00:35:55.872
I don't want to.

367
00:35:56.302 --> 00:35:58.180
Do as you please.

368
00:35:58.887 --> 00:35:59.762
Come on.

369
00:36:01.314 --> 00:36:02.333
I'll wait for you here.

370
00:36:02.357 --> 00:36:04.084
Yeah, wait for me...

371
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:47.252
Sit down.

372
00:37:28.425 --> 00:37:29.736
Come over here.

373
00:37:36.772 --> 00:37:37.959
Come close.

374
00:38:15.009 --> 00:38:16.437
Kiss me.

375
00:38:21.835 --> 00:38:22.953
You alright?

376
00:38:22.977 --> 00:38:23.949
Yes.

377
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.940
Get undressed,
don't stay like that.


378
00:39:30.646 --> 00:39:32.502
Do you like to watch?

379
00:39:32.841 --> 00:39:36.138
Yes, it's beauiful.
I think you're both beautiful.


380
00:39:39.162 --> 00:39:40.756
I have to pee.

381
00:39:52.179 --> 00:39:53.664
Do you want to kiss me?

382
00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:55.559
Yes.

383
00:40:12.212 --> 00:40:13.647
It's late.

384
00:40:14.684 --> 00:40:15.441
What?

385
00:40:15.935 --> 00:40:18.501
I think you should go.
My parents are next door.


386
00:40:18.525 --> 00:40:19.281
Sorry?

387
00:40:19.305 --> 00:40:21.340
It'd be a pity if they heard us.

388
00:40:21.796 --> 00:40:22.660
Your parents are just there?

389
00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:24.995
Yes, so just go.

390
00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.525
Handsome, eh?

391
00:40:43.192 --> 00:40:45.226
"So the young girl will dance-

392
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.416
- and the young men and the
old men together will change..."


393
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.712
Would change.

394
00:40:50.121 --> 00:40:52.159
- "Would change their pain..."
- What?


395
00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.380
Would change...

396
00:40:57.046 --> 00:41:00.059
"I would make joy follow their pain."

397
00:41:11.066 --> 00:41:12.300
What're you doing?

398
00:41:12.831 --> 00:41:13.905
Nothing.

399
00:41:17.456 --> 00:41:19.407
Why are you looking at me like that?

400
00:41:26.142 --> 00:41:28.132
What are you up to?

401
00:41:43.648 --> 00:41:45.311
What's this nonsense?

402
00:42:36.952 --> 00:42:38.652
See that guy over there?

403
00:42:38.676 --> 00:42:40.052
With the bonnet.

404
00:42:40.618 --> 00:42:42.289
- Next to the blonde?
- Yes.


405
00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:45.703
Go over and get him.
Do him.


406
00:43:05.203 --> 00:43:06.629
Sweetheart, will you get me a drink?

407
00:43:06.653 --> 00:43:08.860
- What?
- Get me a drink, please?


408
00:43:08.884 --> 00:43:10.401
- Right now?
- Yes.


409
00:43:11.682 --> 00:43:12.609
Alright.

410
00:43:35.423 --> 00:43:37.084
- Do you want to kiss me?
- What?


411
00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:38.695
Do you want to kiss me?

412
00:43:38.913 --> 00:43:39.957
Kiss you?

413
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:43.525
No, I'm with my girlfriend.

414
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:45.367
Who cares?
She can't see us.


415
00:43:55.837 --> 00:43:57.859
You're unbelievable.

416
00:44:01.885 --> 00:44:03.686
I want you to suck me.

417
00:44:11.867 --> 00:44:13.344
Go on, suck me.

418
00:44:53.445 --> 00:44:54.379
Diane!

419
00:44:56.646 --> 00:44:57.534
Diane!

420
00:44:59.326 --> 00:45:00.612
What happened?

421
00:45:01.922 --> 00:45:03.201
Leave me alone.

422
00:45:03.557 --> 00:45:05.169
Did he give you the brush-off?

423
00:45:05.193 --> 00:45:07.117
I don't want to talk to you.

424
00:45:08.653 --> 00:45:12.786
You fuck like a whore.
It doesn't bother you. I can't do it.


425
00:45:12.812 --> 00:45:15.446
Oh la la. It's not like that.

426
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:19.263
A one-night stand with a
guy means nothing. Nothing.


427
00:45:23.164 --> 00:45:25.826
You know what?
We'll find you a guy.


428
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.743
He'll be yours.
It'll be great.


429
00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:31.112
I promise, it'll be great.

430
00:45:32.445 --> 00:45:33.969
Want to go home?

431
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:36.110
- I'm tired.
- You're tired.


432
00:45:36.827 --> 00:45:38.878
It's freezing.

433
00:45:39.162 --> 00:45:40.305
Really cold.

434
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.081
- What about your guy?
- Shit!


435
00:45:43.976 --> 00:45:46.167
Who gives a fuck!
Let's go.


436
00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:50.829
Want to go?

437
00:45:51.143 --> 00:45:52.386
Yes, it looks interesting.

438
00:45:52.504 --> 00:45:54.542
The exhibitions look good.

439
00:45:56.137 --> 00:45:58.961
As it's sunny,
I'd like to take the cable car.


440
00:45:59.337 --> 00:46:00.913
Julia, are you okay?

441
00:46:00.937 --> 00:46:02.650
Yes, fine. Why?

442
00:46:02.674 --> 00:46:05.438
I don't know.
You look strange.


443
00:46:05.693 --> 00:46:07.070
- I didn't sleep well.
- Pardon?


444
00:46:07.094 --> 00:46:10.492
- I didn't sleep well.
- You look like death warmed up.


445
00:46:11.628 --> 00:46:14.229
It's true.
You could say thank you.


446
00:46:14.369 --> 00:46:17.243
We invite your
friend for the weekend-


447
00:46:17.267 --> 00:46:19.291
- and you look glum all the time.

448
00:46:19.315 --> 00:46:21.007
Thanks a lot.

449
00:46:22.419 --> 00:46:26.732
It's my fault. I talked to her
all night and kept her awake.


450
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:29.561
I had lots of things to tell her.

451
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.548
- Did it go well?
- Yes.


452
00:46:39.611 --> 00:46:42.008
- Hello, Marc.
- Hi.


453
00:46:42.083 --> 00:46:43.147
'Scuse me.

454
00:46:46.996 --> 00:46:48.215
What's for dinner?

455
00:46:49.263 --> 00:46:51.468
We're going to eat healthily.

456
00:46:51.735 --> 00:46:54.019
Vegetables!
What you like best.


457
00:46:54.043 --> 00:46:55.181
Plates!

458
00:46:59.898 --> 00:47:01.483
Out of the way, you!

459
00:47:05.261 --> 00:47:07.412
- This is Annick.
- Ah, Diane!


460
00:47:08.006 --> 00:47:09.044
Hello.

461
00:47:10.649 --> 00:47:12.454
Watch out! It's burning.

462
00:47:12.478 --> 00:47:14.443
We work together.

463
00:47:15.371 --> 00:47:16.871
Have you got any lemons?

464
00:47:17.722 --> 00:47:20.309
Have we got any lemons?
I don't think so...


465
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.534
No.

466
00:47:22.696 --> 00:47:23.799
Salt and pepper?

467
00:47:23.823 --> 00:47:28.212
Salt and pepper,
seasonings and spice are there.


468
00:47:35.234 --> 00:47:37.104
Don't hold back with that!

469
00:47:37.857 --> 00:47:40.244
Is she also in
charge when you fuck?


470
00:47:42.938 --> 00:47:46.365
What's gotten into you, Diane?
What's with you?


471
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.648
Be quiet, you!

472
00:48:22.235 --> 00:48:24.740
- How're things?
- Fine.


473
00:48:26.942 --> 00:48:28.554
Make any coffee?

474
00:48:28.841 --> 00:48:29.555
No.

475
00:48:32.575 --> 00:48:33.780
Why not?

476
00:48:36.893 --> 00:48:38.187
You okay?

477
00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:41.660
Yes.

478
00:48:47.222 --> 00:48:48.674
Where's Marc?

479
00:48:49.669 --> 00:48:50.822
Asleep.

480
00:48:53.623 --> 00:48:56.365
- You didn't wake him?
- No.


481
00:48:56.432 --> 00:48:57.583
Why not?

482
00:48:57.795 --> 00:48:59.122
Didn't feel like it.

483
00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:05.870
I'm not his father.

484
00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:11.360
See you this evening.

485
00:50:44.213 --> 00:50:45.501
I saw her there.

486
00:50:51.513 --> 00:50:52.303
Julia!

487
00:50:53.304 --> 00:50:54.332
How're you?

488
00:50:56.513 --> 00:50:58.896
- Where's your father?
- Over there.


489
00:50:59.114 --> 00:51:01.364
- I see him.
- I'll carry your case.


490
00:51:01.594 --> 00:51:05.950
I must thank him. If not for him
I'd be at home, bored to death!


491
00:51:09.713 --> 00:51:10.975
Want to go in front?

492
00:51:11.907 --> 00:51:13.513
- Dunno.
- Go in front.


493
00:51:13.668 --> 00:51:15.200
Okay, thanks.

494
00:51:24.893 --> 00:51:26.588
Whatever suits you.

495
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.159
I'm here with the kids...

496
00:51:29.668 --> 00:51:34.569
My parents might come at the end
of the week, for a couple of days.


497
00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.777
You want to meet them?

498
00:51:38.694 --> 00:51:40.143
You must be joking.

499
00:51:40.626 --> 00:51:42.189
No, listen...

500
00:51:42.253 --> 00:51:44.975
I'll see if you can come
down for a day or two.


501
00:51:44.999 --> 00:51:47.768
Lots of kisses.
Ciao.


502
00:51:59.237 --> 00:52:00.789
Do you think Julia's awake?

503
00:52:00.813 --> 00:52:02.003
Dunno.

504
00:52:03.643 --> 00:52:05.226
You look peaky.

505
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.617
Why do you say that?

506
00:52:08.707 --> 00:52:10.321
Are you in love?

507
00:52:10.345 --> 00:52:11.585
Nonsense.

508
00:52:11.609 --> 00:52:14.646
You can tell me everything, you know.
I can see you and Julia are close...


509
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:15.614
What did she say?

510
00:52:15.638 --> 00:52:18.760
She said nothing.
It's just me who...


511
00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:20.367
Dad, you see nothing.

512
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:22.985
You don't know what's happening.

513
00:52:23.135 --> 00:52:25.270
You always talk such rubbish.

514
00:52:26.122 --> 00:52:28.812
- You have a problem with me.
- I don't have a problem...


515
00:52:28.836 --> 00:52:31.935
Look after your slut,
leave me alone.


516
00:52:32.043 --> 00:52:34.210
Don't get all pissed off.
Wait...


517
00:52:34.366 --> 00:52:35.818
Diane!

518
00:52:36.199 --> 00:52:38.864
- Carry the shopping.
- There's glass in there!


519
00:52:40.985 --> 00:52:42.098
Diane!

520
00:52:42.975 --> 00:52:46.033
I just wanted us...
to have a little chat!


521
00:53:02.664 --> 00:53:05.091
How's it going?
What're you doing?


522
00:53:05.143 --> 00:53:07.600
I went for a run.
It's hot, eh?


523
00:53:08.825 --> 00:53:09.839
Yeah.

524
00:53:10.402 --> 00:53:11.710
Yeah.

525
00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:16.530
What're you doing?
Hurry up.


526
00:53:16.554 --> 00:53:18.386
Cool it, we're on holiday.

527
00:53:19.267 --> 00:53:21.880
There's nothing here.
So fucking boring!


528
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:25.953
Let's go over there.
There might be more going on.


529
00:53:26.335 --> 00:53:29.468
- We'll get a drink, meet some guys.
- Don't feel like it.


530
00:53:29.711 --> 00:53:32.264
- Maybe you're just scared.
- No.


531
00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:37.150
You could make an effort.

532
00:53:37.875 --> 00:53:39.019
What?

533
00:53:39.043 --> 00:53:40.723
Take off your cardigan.

534
00:53:41.075 --> 00:53:42.760
No, it's a great cardigan.

535
00:53:42.784 --> 00:53:44.446
- No, it's dull.
- It's great.


536
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:45.622
It's ugly.

537
00:53:45.646 --> 00:53:49.573
Hello, I'm Julia,
this is my friend, Diane.


538
00:53:49.854 --> 00:53:52.095
Can we come for
a ride on the boat?

539
00:53:53.713 --> 00:53:55.367
He doesn't speak French.

540
00:53:59.845 --> 00:54:02.685
It's her first time.
She's never been on a boat.


541
00:54:07.343 --> 00:54:09.199
- You okay?
- I'm fine.


542
00:54:21.616 --> 00:54:23.335
Looks like he's panicking.

543
00:54:29.502 --> 00:54:31.506
A little boat ride...

544
00:54:36.804 --> 00:54:39.309
- Cute, isn't he?
- Yeah.


545
00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:40.919
- Yeah?
- I dunno.


546
00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:44.404
Come on, he's really cute!
Admit it.


547
00:54:59.545 --> 00:55:01.304
Move closer to him.

548
00:55:25.224 --> 00:55:26.877
Sing a little song.

549
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:31.967
Your turn.

550
00:55:35.807 --> 00:55:37.527
Stop it, Dad.

551
00:55:47.605 --> 00:55:50.210
Snap your fingers.
Can you do it?


552
00:56:58.771 --> 00:57:01.116
Be gentle, she's a virgin.

553
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:35.899
Well, yeah!

554
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:13.935
Come here.

555
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.019
What?

556
00:59:16.682 --> 00:59:18.797
Show me your face.

557
00:59:19.037 --> 00:59:20.384
What about it?

558
00:59:21.433 --> 00:59:24.676
I don't feel different.
It's you who's happy.


559
00:59:28.374 --> 00:59:30.004
It's thanks to me.

560
00:59:34.184 --> 00:59:35.368
Come.

561
00:59:40.505 --> 00:59:42.307
I didn't feel anything.

562
00:59:42.724 --> 00:59:44.360
Is that normal?

563
00:59:44.559 --> 00:59:46.013
I dunno.

564
00:59:46.075 --> 00:59:48.963
Who cares?
The important thing is you did it.


565
00:59:49.627 --> 00:59:50.576
Yeah.

566
01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:06.387
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes.


567
01:00:39.728 --> 01:00:41.470
I've got the ball!

568
01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:00.781
It's freezing!

569
01:01:19.082 --> 01:01:20.029
Dad?

570
01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.639
- Dad, can I come in?
- What?


571
01:01:22.663 --> 01:01:23.900
Can I take a pee?

572
01:01:23.924 --> 01:01:24.962
Okay.

573
01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:29.005
Sit down.

574
01:01:30.507 --> 01:01:32.350
No, I don't want to sit down.

575
01:01:39.902 --> 01:01:41.923
Hey, what are you doing here?

576
01:01:42.637 --> 01:01:44.343
You're so stupid.

577
01:01:44.841 --> 01:01:46.889
That's enough, girls.

578
01:01:48.535 --> 01:01:52.354
I don't believe it!
Really! You can't do this.


579
01:01:55.624 --> 01:01:57.562
I'll do the same to you.

580
01:01:58.523 --> 01:01:59.576
Here.

581
01:02:00.607 --> 01:02:01.991
Goddammit, Marc.

582
01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:07.408
- It's so hot.
- I'll do that. Thanks.


583
01:02:13.714 --> 01:02:16.405
- Fancy watching a film?
- Yeah.


584
01:02:17.013 --> 01:02:19.446
What've we got here?
Karaoke.


585
01:02:19.812 --> 01:02:21.110
We have to do it!

586
01:03:10.044 --> 01:03:11.611
What're you doing?

587
01:03:12.318 --> 01:03:14.173
I can't sleep.

588
01:03:17.736 --> 01:03:19.039
What're you looking for?

589
01:03:19.063 --> 01:03:21.353
The cigarettes.
I want to smoke a cigarette.


590
01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:22.973
- You do?
- Yeah.


591
01:03:22.997 --> 01:03:26.739
They're in my bag,
on the cupboard.


592
01:03:30.856 --> 01:03:32.181
What are you doing?

593
01:03:32.205 --> 01:03:33.310
Nothing.

594
01:03:33.334 --> 01:03:36.066
Go back to sleep.
Sweet dreams.


595
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.336
Give, I'll light it.

596
01:04:00.139 --> 01:04:01.258
Here.

597
01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:19.862
We're good together, huh?
All together.


598
01:04:20.035 --> 01:04:21.246
I know.

599
01:05:03.836 --> 01:05:06.526
You should move around a bit, girls.

600
01:05:10.405 --> 01:05:11.298
No.

601
01:05:18.399 --> 01:05:20.500
Come on! Wake up!

602
01:05:27.809 --> 01:05:29.359
I'm out of water. Wait!

603
01:05:33.935 --> 01:05:34.953
No!

604
01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:41.258
There!
That got you moving.


605
01:05:43.193 --> 01:05:44.937
Wow!

606
01:05:45.094 --> 01:05:46.635
Is this my daughter?

607
01:05:46.659 --> 01:05:48.022
Julia lent it to me.

608
01:05:48.046 --> 01:05:49.380
It suits you.

609
01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:52.034
And this? Aren't you going
to put it on? Show me.


610
01:05:57.149 --> 01:05:58.531
It suits you.

611
01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:01.286
- You're wearing make-up, too!
- Stop!


612
01:06:06.901 --> 01:06:09.535
- We'll have a drink together!
- Think that's a good idea?


613
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.481
- Yes!
- Okay, then.


614
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:14.459
- One little glass.
- That's little...


615
01:06:16.412 --> 01:06:17.368
Thanks.

616
01:06:19.831 --> 01:06:20.779
Cheers!

617
01:06:22.155 --> 01:06:23.935
I'll open this for you.

618
01:06:24.753 --> 01:06:26.024
There.

619
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.888
Already?

620
01:06:28.205 --> 01:06:30.007
What did you expect?

621
01:06:30.863 --> 01:06:32.816
You're so stingy.

622
01:06:38.886 --> 01:06:40.899
Go and dance!

623
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:44.244
Coming?

624
01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:44.497
Shall we go?

625
01:07:45.335 --> 01:07:46.840
- What?
- Shall we go?


626
01:07:47.445 --> 01:07:48.960
- Already?
- Where's Marc?


627
01:07:48.984 --> 01:07:51.651
I saw Marc sleeping over there.

628
01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:18.574
What're you doing here?

629
01:08:18.613 --> 01:08:19.910
Nothing.

630
01:08:24.499 --> 01:08:27.872
- Are you going out again?
- No, I'm staying here.


631
01:08:27.896 --> 01:08:30.653
- Aren't you going to bed?
- No, not going to bed.


632
01:08:36.394 --> 01:08:37.929
No, no... wait.

633
01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:55.662
Wait...

634
01:09:03.155 --> 01:09:05.014
Everybody's sleeping.

635
01:09:05.456 --> 01:09:06.691
This isn't a good idea.

636
01:09:09.576 --> 01:09:10.610
No.

637
01:09:11.174 --> 01:09:13.133
No, no no...

638
01:09:13.613 --> 01:09:15.078
You musn't.

639
01:09:15.331 --> 01:09:16.836
No. Okay?

640
01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.940
Better not.

641
01:09:29.735 --> 01:09:31.250
No. Stop.

642
01:09:31.386 --> 01:09:32.610
Stop.

643
01:09:37.808 --> 01:09:39.186
Stop.

644
01:11:06.918 --> 01:11:08.558
What're you doing here?

645
01:11:10.989 --> 01:11:12.027
Wait...

646
01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:16.049
Jeez...

647
01:11:17.013 --> 01:11:18.320
Wait, Diane!

648
01:11:18.688 --> 01:11:19.782
Shit!

649
01:11:30.868 --> 01:11:33.229
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

650
01:11:33.573 --> 01:11:35.511
- Let go of me!
- Where are you going?


651
01:11:35.535 --> 01:11:37.390
Let her go, for God's sake!

652
01:11:37.734 --> 01:11:38.646
Diane!

653
01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:46.531
Bastard!

654
01:13:46.813 --> 01:13:49.376
Bastard! Fuck!

655
01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:52.984
Bastard!

656
01:14:25.989 --> 01:14:27.814
I'm cold.
Let's go back.


657
01:14:27.849 --> 01:14:28.918
Okay.

658
01:14:42.593 --> 01:14:44.032
Are you sulking?

659
01:14:45.094 --> 01:14:46.235
No.

660
01:14:47.551 --> 01:14:51.017
I'd have left, too.
But I wouldn't have come back.


661
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:54.853
I didn't come back.

662
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.440
My father came to get me.

663
01:14:58.241 --> 01:15:00.581
Same difference.
You're here, aren't you?


664
01:15:01.981 --> 01:15:03.813
Shut up, please.

665
01:15:04.303 --> 01:15:05.757
Come here.

666
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.686
Come on.

667
01:15:10.213 --> 01:15:11.846
I don't give a shit about your father.

668
01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.791
Or the others.
It's just for fun.


669
01:15:45.793 --> 01:15:47.475
Would you do something for me?

670
01:15:48.283 --> 01:15:49.389
Dunno.

671
01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:50.934
If I asked you?

672
01:15:51.303 --> 01:15:53.329
What?
Do what?


673
01:15:54.209 --> 01:15:57.239
To split... right now, on foot.

674
01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.634
Leave everyone behind.

675
01:15:59.915 --> 01:16:01.750
Just drop everyone.

676
01:16:01.993 --> 01:16:03.224
What for?

677
01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.897
For fun!

678
01:16:05.059 --> 01:16:09.292
'Cos we don't give a shit.
That's what counts, huh?


679
01:16:09.577 --> 01:16:11.693
I don't think so.
I don't feel like it.


680
01:16:12.176 --> 01:16:13.579
Where would we go?

681
01:16:18.431 --> 01:16:19.983
What're you doing?

682
01:16:33.484 --> 01:16:36.121
Diane!
Stop, Diane, stop!


683
01:16:37.184 --> 01:16:39.262
Diane!

684
01:16:51.296 --> 01:16:53.009
What're you doing?

685
01:16:54.081 --> 01:16:55.555
Come here.
