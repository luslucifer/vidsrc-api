Man: <i>Mac, you built a golf
course in a nature reserve?</i>


8
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.254
<i>Our</i> nature reserve,
brother.


9
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.591
While you were away
getting your fancy education,


10
00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:15.863
I was creating business
from our land.


11
00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:16.854
What happened
to all the wolves


12
00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:18.199
in this area?

13
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:19.606
We built caves for them
up in the hills,


14
00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:21.271
<i>don't worry.</i>

15
00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.734
- <i>Fake caves?</i>
- <i>Yes, Ian.</i>


16
00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:25.878
<i>Some wolves are already
living in them.</i>


17
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.406
Don't you remember what
great-grandfather warned of?


18
00:02:28.408 --> 00:02:31.062
Yes, yes, he said,
"Take care of your people."


19
00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:33.303
And now we'll get
new schools, a hospital...


20
00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:36.150
He also said,
"Never disturb nature.


21
00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:38.135
Or nature
will disturb you."


22
00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:39.354
(screaming)

23
00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:45.176
(grunting)

24
00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:59.255
Ian: You're digging up
sacred grounds too?


25
00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:00.854
Spirits are buried here!

26
00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:01.943
(chuckles)

27
00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:03.863
No, the so-called,
"spirits"


28
00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:05.686
are actually
dinosaur skeletons.


29
00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:08.119
<i>Dinosaur skeletons?</i>

30
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.198
And I found a museum
who's willing to pay


31
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.590
tens of millions of dollars
for these bones.


32
00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:15.161
We'll be very rich.

33
00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:36.021
(gasps)
Oh, no.


34
00:03:36.023 --> 00:03:38.263
<i>Oh, oh,
this is bad.</i>


35
00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:39.958
<i>What do I do?</i>

36
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.198
<i>Okay, I gotta stop this.</i>

37
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.383
Oh, crickets.

38
00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:45.625
(groans)

39
00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:59.383
Female Wolf: <i>So, you two
decided to take the plunge</i>


40
00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:01.462
<i>and move
to Wolf-burbia?</i>


41
00:04:01.464 --> 00:04:03.031
Female Wolf #2:
<i>Well, we're considering it.</i>


42
00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.303
<i>Some wolves
love the idea.</i>


43
00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:06.966
Male Wolf:
<i>Others don't.</i>


44
00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:08.822
- <i>Humphrey...</i>
- <i>Kate...</i>


45
00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:10.902
Well, I hear
it's very safe here.


46
00:04:10.904 --> 00:04:13.590
We have a problem with
rogue wolves in our area.


47
00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:15.062
And with three pups
who have a tendency


48
00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:17.591
to get into preteen trouble.

49
00:04:17.593 --> 00:04:20.630
Well,
no rogue wolves here.


50
00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:23.350
Your pups
will be very safe.


51
00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:25.526
And here we go.

52
00:04:25.528 --> 00:04:27.062
Isn't it perfect?

53
00:04:27.064 --> 00:04:29.973
Oh... Yes!

54
00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:33.303
Too perfect.

55
00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:35.702
(sniffing)

56
00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:36.694
(thuds)

57
00:04:36.696 --> 00:04:38.742
Uh, I knew it, Kate!

58
00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.726
This cave is made
of plastic?


59
00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.902
It's actually
recycled material.


60
00:04:42.904 --> 00:04:45.782
The unnatural
is the new natural.


61
00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:48.566
"The unnatural
is the new natural?"


62
00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:50.070
That sounds like
when my Uncle Tony


63
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:52.279
came home
with a fur toupee.


64
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:53.334
Golfer:
<i>Fore!</i>


65
00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:55.126
Oh! And look
at that view.


66
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:59.670
<i>Oh, what a location,
location, location.</i>


67
00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:02.933
Why don't you
look inside?


68
00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.950
It's very high-tech.

69
00:05:04.952 --> 00:05:07.830
You know
the preteens and tech.


70
00:05:07.832 --> 00:05:10.262
Preteens wolf pups
and tech?


71
00:05:10.264 --> 00:05:12.376
Kate:
<i>Come on, Humphrey.</i>


72
00:05:15.032 --> 00:05:17.877
Humphrey: <i>Wait a minute, did
lights just come on automatically?</i>


73
00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.278
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- Greetings.


74
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.689
What?

75
00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:24.118
Birds. Out of here now.

76
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.909
Shoo!

77
00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:27.894
Shoo, I have a sale
in progress.


78
00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:29.974
We are aware
of that, madam.


79
00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:32.118
- That is why we're here.
- (growling)


80
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.302
No, you are here

81
00:05:33.304 --> 00:05:35.509
to leave bird droppings
on my sidewalks.


82
00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:37.141
(growls, barks)

83
00:05:37.143 --> 00:05:39.414
Bird droppings
on your sidewalk?


84
00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:41.399
How about a bird dropping
in your eye!


85
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.322
And I just ate
a lot of fiber.


86
00:05:45.975 --> 00:05:47.093
(passes gas)

87
00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:48.566
(yelps)

88
00:05:48.568 --> 00:05:51.990
You evil birds.

89
00:05:51.992 --> 00:05:53.846
Well done, Paddy.

90
00:05:53.848 --> 00:05:55.863
We English
are very precise.


91
00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:57.398
What's going on?

92
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.118
Your real estate lady
wouldn't let us land.


93
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.549
Oh, Carney
these are our friends.


94
00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:05.207
They're the godparents
of our three pups.


95
00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:06.389
They're here to give us

96
00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:09.013
an unbiased, uncoached,
second opinion


97
00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:12.694
of this hideous,
unlivable, plastic cave.


98
00:06:12.696 --> 00:06:14.646
Oh, well,

99
00:06:14.648 --> 00:06:17.494
I actually love birds.

100
00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:22.165
- So...
- Right back at you.


101
00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.056
Kate: <i>So, Marcel and
Paddy, what do you think?</i>


102
00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:33.334
It's very safe here,
no rogue wolves.


103
00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:35.162
Well, safety
is very important.


104
00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:38.391
(thuds)

105
00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:40.502
Peck, peck.
Who's there?


106
00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:42.646
Oh, they don't
build them like they...


107
00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:45.431
Wait a minute.
Caves aren't built at all.


108
00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:48.250
They're just
naturally formed, madam.


109
00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:57.078
But you know,
it's not half bad here.


110
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.125
Eighteen holes.
PGA designed.


111
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.525
In fact,
I love it here.


112
00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:03.702
VoilÃ !
There you have it.


113
00:07:03.704 --> 00:07:05.557
Oh, I... I see.

114
00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:06.774
Yes, very nice.

115
00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:10.550
I... I concur.
Very nice green-ery.


116
00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:11.990
Okay, Humphrey.

117
00:07:11.992 --> 00:07:15.383
You now have our second
and third opinion.


118
00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:17.238
Do it for the pups.

119
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.886
Ugh. I guess we're moving
to Wolf-burbia.


120
00:07:20.888 --> 00:07:22.073
Oh!

121
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.718
(moans)

122
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.222
That feels better.

123
00:07:35.224 --> 00:07:36.662
Kate:
<i>Humphrey?</i>


124
00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.102
<i>You know, I think moving
the pups are night</i>


125
00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:39.799
<i>was a great idea.</i>

126
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.941
<i>The shock would've been
too much for them.</i>


127
00:07:41.943 --> 00:07:44.149
And carrying our three
"Sleeping Beauties"


128
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.199
was quite the shock
to my back.


129
00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:48.825
Kate: <i>Can you wake them up,
breakfast is almost ready.</i>


130
00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:53.334
(yawns)

131
00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:56.854
Okay, where does
that light come from?


132
00:07:56.856 --> 00:08:01.014
Breakfast is ready
and I see we're...


133
00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:02.869
Humphrey!
They're not up?


134
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:04.021
Sorry, Kate.

135
00:08:04.023 --> 00:08:05.781
My omega alarm clock
didn't work.


136
00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:08.821
Maybe your alpha one will?

137
00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:09.782
(growls)

138
00:08:09.784 --> 00:08:11.063
Where's the hunt?

139
00:08:11.065 --> 00:08:12.086
Caribou.

140
00:08:12.088 --> 00:08:15.511
I have to pee.

141
00:08:15.513 --> 00:08:17.813
Okay, pups.
First day in your new home.


142
00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:20.312
Look around.
Aren't you excited?


143
00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:27.861
I'm glad you carried us in
while we were sleeping.


144
00:08:27.863 --> 00:08:29.270
Why's that, Stinky?

145
00:08:29.272 --> 00:08:31.830
'Cause I would've
run away.


146
00:08:31.832 --> 00:08:33.143
Mom, Dad,

147
00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.541
this cave is like
a total poseur.


148
00:08:35.543 --> 00:08:36.887
What is this stuff?

149
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:40.598
Oh, honey, it's called
recycled material.


150
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.894
Recycled?
As in plastic bottles?


151
00:08:43.896 --> 00:08:47.157
(slurps)
I think I taste cola.


152
00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:50.294
Your father and I
are completely aligned


153
00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.814
that moving here is
a great idea for our family.


154
00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:55.065
(mouthing words)

155
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.696
(sighs) Okay, let's tour
the new neighborhood.


156
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.822
Dad, now that we moved
to the 'burbs,


157
00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:11.703
why does mom have
a constant smile on her face?


158
00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:13.045
I don't know, son.

159
00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:15.318
To balance out
my constant scowl?


160
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.078
So, I don't get it,

161
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.254
why are we living
in this area?


162
00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:21.270
Well, it's
a very safe environment.


163
00:09:21.272 --> 00:09:23.894
- <i>(golf clubs thwacking)</i>
- Golfers: <i>Fore!</i>


164
00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.973
Heads-up!

165
00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:27.257
(popping)

166
00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:32.214
You were saying, Kate?

167
00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:34.135
Runt was once
kidnapped by rogues


168
00:09:34.137 --> 00:09:35.989
and we're a family
that's a bit prone


169
00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:38.966
to getting into...
situations.


170
00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:42.167
I'd take golf balls
over rogue wolves any day.


171
00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:44.918
But that's what being
a wild animal's all about,


172
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.030
surviving the wild.

173
00:09:47.032 --> 00:09:49.112
(gasps)
Look! A lake.


174
00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:54.551
(sniffing)

175
00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:57.624
- I smell chlorine.
- Wait a minute.


176
00:10:03.831 --> 00:10:05.493
The lake is fake.

177
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:08.149
Wait, are you sure?

178
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:10.232
<i>(music plays)</i>

179
00:10:18.423 --> 00:10:20.694
This place is very off.

180
00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:22.232
Marcel:
<i>Fore!</i>


181
00:10:23.607 --> 00:10:26.198
My point exactly.

182
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.182
(rattles)

183
00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:30.326
Well done, Marcel.

184
00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:34.198
Hello, wolves.
Did you just see my shot?


185
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.069
We did.
Good job, Marcel.


186
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:39.990
Pups, welcome
to your new neighborhood.


187
00:10:39.992 --> 00:10:41.241
How do you like it
so far?


188
00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:45.782
Adjusting, huh?
Oh.


189
00:10:45.784 --> 00:10:48.373
Well, Kate and Humphrey,
now that you're living here


190
00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:51.926
I insist on giving you
golf lessons.


191
00:10:51.928 --> 00:10:53.237
Maybe the whole family
can learn.


192
00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:57.270
A fun activity.
Together.


193
00:10:57.272 --> 00:10:59.989
Well, Paddy.
Shall we play on?


194
00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:01.848
Yes, back to the green.

195
00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:11.989
Hey, Mom, Dad,
see that forest over there?


196
00:11:11.991 --> 00:11:16.534
- Yes?
- We're going to hang out there.


197
00:11:16.536 --> 00:11:18.389
You wanna
stay with us, Runt?


198
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.735
Nope, I have to pee

199
00:11:19.737 --> 00:11:21.625
and I don't wanna worry
about carpeting.


200
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.542
Now this is more like it.

201
00:11:31.544 --> 00:11:34.134
I can't believe they moved
from our awesome wild home


202
00:11:34.136 --> 00:11:35.413
<i>to a bland community.</i>

203
00:11:35.415 --> 00:11:37.109
<i>I mean, we're wolves.</i>

204
00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:39.093
Seriously.
And did you hear Mom say


205
00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:41.365
that we're always
getting into trouble?


206
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.278
As if we walk right
into situations.


207
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.654
(sniffs)

208
00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:47.733
I smell something strange.

209
00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:49.846
Something really different.

210
00:11:49.848 --> 00:11:51.929
And your smell
is never wrong.


211
00:11:53.687 --> 00:11:55.480
(sniffing)

212
00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:02.614
(snorts)

213
00:12:02.616 --> 00:12:06.005
Whoa. Claudette, Runt.
Come here, quick.


214
00:12:06.007 --> 00:12:08.087
Are those eyes?

215
00:12:09.943 --> 00:12:11.833
Let me do
my tree hugger thing.


216
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.494
Hey there,
are you okay?


217
00:12:17.496 --> 00:12:18.614
I'm Runt.

218
00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:20.182
And below is my sister,
Claudette.


219
00:12:20.184 --> 00:12:21.366
And my brother, Stinky.

220
00:12:21.368 --> 00:12:22.677
We just moved
to the neighborhood.


221
00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:25.046
Are you in trouble?
Do you need help?


222
00:12:25.048 --> 00:12:27.254
Is it a reptile
up in a tree?


223
00:12:27.256 --> 00:12:28.854
I can't tell!

224
00:12:28.856 --> 00:12:30.934
Hey, it's kinda nice
seeing another creature.


225
00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:32.213
We just moved here

226
00:12:32.215 --> 00:12:34.070
and wanted to make friends
with the locals.


227
00:12:34.072 --> 00:12:36.505
We're very accepting
of all critters.


228
00:12:38.552 --> 00:12:41.365
(screaming)

229
00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:43.160

Dinosaur:
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>


231
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:52.502
Stinky: Wow, new
home, new problem.


232
00:12:52.504 --> 00:12:53.845
Dinosaur:
Wait!


233
00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:55.381
Claudette:
<i>You're telling me.</i>


234
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:57.718
Runt: <i>Does anyone
know what that is?</i>


235
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.734
Wait! Wait!

236

Oh, crickets.
Dear, goodness.


237

This is what
we evolved to?


238
00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:05.366
Miniature dogs?

239
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.478
I didn't mean
to scare you!


240
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.593
You said you liked
being helpful!


241

Oh!

00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:44.758
Now, let's all
do the spin out.

all wanted the wild,


258
00:14:04.056 --> 00:14:05.718

(Stinky groans)

260
00:14:06.968 --> 00:14:08.857
Maybe we should've gone
golfing after all.


261
00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:12.760
Now, get your legs
in an even stance.


262
00:14:15.095 --> 00:14:17.429
This is my even stance.

263
00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:19.862
Humphrey,
weight on your heels.


264
00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:21.685
It looks like you're going
to lay a turd.


265
00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:24.117
Hello,
I'm a four-legged creature.


266
00:14:24.119 --> 00:14:25.558
This isn't
natural for me.

Kate: Humphrey,
listen to Marcel.


268

Paddy: And keep your head
down when you follow through.

272
00:14:40.855 --> 00:14:43.734
I can't golf

in my eyeline.

274

Where's a dog cone

275
00:14:51.479 --> 00:14:53.205
<i>Focus on the ball.</i>

276
00:14:53.207 --> 00:14:55.253
Focus on the ball.

277
00:14:55.255 --> 00:14:56.632
Wha...

278
00:15:00.663 --> 00:15:02.933

Easy, ladies.

286
00:15:17.112 --> 00:15:20.021
I think I'll take flight.
(chuckles)


287
00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:21.878
Marcel, what do I do?

288
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.465
Humphrey, think of this
as a teachable moment.

290
00:15:30.488 --> 00:15:32.537
Kate,
a little help here!

(Paddy quacks)

292
00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:41.718
Paddy, I think
it's time we did


293
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.222
a quick migration
to the lake.


294
00:15:43.224 --> 00:15:45.141
- Righty, ho!
- (quacks)


295
00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:47.861
Come on, ladies.
It was an accident.


296
00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.909
Caribou:
<i>Talk to the antlers.</i>


297
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:51.894
- (whacks)
- Hey!


298
00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:53.493

299
00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.153
- (Humphrey screams)
- (Caribous laughing)

00:15:57.527 --> 00:15:59.604
(screams)

301
00:15:59.606 --> 00:16:02.901
Humphrey is just
not suited for golf.


302
00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:04.949
Did you see how bad
that swing was?


303
00:16:04.951 --> 00:16:06.231
Humphrey:
I heard that!


304
00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:10.006
(thuds)

305
00:16:10.008 --> 00:16:11.801
(banging)

306
00:16:14.904 --> 00:16:16.725
Humphrey, are you okay?

307
00:16:16.727 --> 00:16:19.544
I told you I'd make it
on to the green.


308
00:16:22.136 --> 00:16:24.310
Okay, let's start
from the top.


309
00:16:24.312 --> 00:16:25.622
My name is Amy.

310
00:16:25.624 --> 00:16:27.092
And I'm a dinosaur.

311
00:16:27.094 --> 00:16:28.437
Pups:
Hi, Amy.


312
00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:30.261
I was living
below the area


313
00:16:30.263 --> 00:16:31.829
where you're now sitting.

314
00:16:31.831 --> 00:16:34.069
There is someone
who dug up this hole


315
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:36.213
and is trying
to sell me and Rex.


316
00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:38.453
But a very bad idea.

317
00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:39.415
Rex?

318
00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:44.534
A T-Rex.
Way down below.


319
00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:46.102
What is that?

320
00:16:46.104 --> 00:16:48.150
I'm a little behind
in my dinosaur knowledge.


321
00:16:48.152 --> 00:16:50.518
And I need
a bit more backstory, Amy.


322
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.438
Backstory? Okay.

323
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.325
Back... Backstory.

324
00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:57.686
65 million years ago,

325
00:16:57.688 --> 00:16:58.966
<i>my mom used to tell me,</i>

326
00:16:58.968 --> 00:17:00.853
<i>if I was in trouble
with predators,</i>


327
00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:03.062
<i>I was to run
to the sacred space.</i>


328
00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.238
<i>And look
for a circle of light.</i>


329
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.150
<i>It was area
of protection.</i>


330
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.030
<i>(thunder rumbles)</i>

331
00:17:11.032 --> 00:17:13.431
(squeaks)

332
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:25.718
- <i>(rumbling continues)</i>
- (gasps)


333
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.384
(roaring)

334
00:17:41.943 --> 00:17:44.790
<i>Something strange
was happening.</i>


335
00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:45.975
(booming)

336
00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:53.749
<i>So, we sort of survived.
Like my mom said we would.</i>


337
00:17:53.751 --> 00:17:56.309
But if they dig down
to the Rex,


338
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:58.677
his spirit
will also emerge.


339
00:17:58.679 --> 00:18:00.373
He's huge and ruthless

340
00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:02.581
and will destroy everything
in his path.


341
00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:04.309
<i>They need
to leave this area alone</i>


342
00:18:04.311 --> 00:18:07.892
<i>or they will be
very sorry.</i>


343
00:18:07.894 --> 00:18:10.133
Oh, crickets.
I hope I didn't scare you.


344
00:18:10.135 --> 00:18:12.661
Not at all.

345
00:18:12.663 --> 00:18:14.296
(car engine rumbles)

346
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.781
Okay, they're back from lunch.
The diggers.


347
00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:23.382
- I gotta hide.
- Wait.


348
00:18:23.384 --> 00:18:24.503
We'll come too.

349
00:18:28.952 --> 00:18:30.710
Griffin, leave the keys
in the car.


350
00:18:30.712 --> 00:18:33.109
I'm not in the mood for you
losing our keys again.


351
00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.062
All right, Jethro.
I'll leave 'em inside.


352
00:18:35.064 --> 00:18:36.501
Ain't no one
around here anyways,


353
00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:37.720
except for us.

354
00:18:40.407 --> 00:18:42.261
Oh, no.
It's the wolf trappers.


355
00:18:42.263 --> 00:18:44.118
- Remember them?
- Yeah.


356
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.781
And now they're diggers?

357
00:18:45.783 --> 00:18:47.349
You know them?

358
00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:50.389
They tried to capture us
but we outsmarted them.


359
00:18:50.391 --> 00:18:51.542
Mm-hmm.

360
00:18:51.544 --> 00:18:53.077
Basically, we kicked
their butt.


361
00:18:53.079 --> 00:18:54.104
Yeah, we did.

362
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:02.485
(pups whispering)

363
00:19:02.487 --> 00:19:03.701
No way, huh-uh.

364
00:19:03.703 --> 00:19:04.758
Okay.

365
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.877
No way!

366
00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.734
Okay, Amy.
We've discussed it.


367
00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:09.462
We're gonna help you
stop them from digging


368
00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:10.678
up that hole.

369
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.206
Thanks.
It's my home too.


370
00:19:13.208 --> 00:19:15.956
I can only go back
when the light shines upon it.


371
00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.334
And I need to go home.

372
00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:19.765
It's the only place
I can survive.


373
00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:21.143
How are you
gonna stop them?


374
00:19:24.888 --> 00:19:27.445
Whew, wow.
It's hot.


375
00:19:27.447 --> 00:19:28.821
Dang hot.

376
00:19:28.823 --> 00:19:30.804
Now this here's
a sacred burial ground.


377
00:19:30.806 --> 00:19:32.149
I sure hope there isn't

378
00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:34.293
some human skeleton
we run into.


379
00:19:34.295 --> 00:19:36.342
'Cause I would
lose my lunch.


380
00:19:36.344 --> 00:19:38.357
I paid $5 for that burrito.

381
00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:39.957
And we lost
a lot of money


382
00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:41.173
when we didn't
catch them wolves.

Is that our truck?


385

386
00:19:53.688 --> 00:19:55.317
Sis, you got this?

387
00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:57.396
Yeah, don't try this
at home, right?


388

Hey, wait!
That's our truck!


389
00:20:00.055 --> 00:20:02.036
Okay, wolf trappers
are in sight.


390

They're getting close.

Hey! That is our truck!

It's that
wolf pup again.

But someone stole our truck
and we just found it here.


430
00:23:21.814 --> 00:23:23.221
We think some wolves
jumped in


431

and drove it away.

Mac: You get back
there first thing.

more of them.

We have a situation.

510
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:52.277
You know how you always
encouraged us


511
00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:54.260
to mix it up
with other critters?


512
00:27:54.262 --> 00:27:57.111
And I never heard you
exclude dinosaurs.


513

Oh, crickets.

514

I think everyone over there
is in shock.

Oh, gosh.
It's still there.


523
00:28:21.111 --> 00:28:23.157
Pups, what have you found?

524
00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.533
Let us explain.

525
00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:26.101
Can we move this
to the cave?


526
00:28:26.103 --> 00:28:28.343
It's cool,
this is our friend, Amy.


527
00:28:31.991 --> 00:28:33.302
Okay, okay.

528
00:28:33.304 --> 00:28:35.988
Let's just say
everything tonight is true.


529
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.525
Let me organize
my thoughts.


530
00:28:37.527 --> 00:28:38.805
According to Amy,
the dinosaur,


531
00:28:38.807 --> 00:28:39.956
we have to stop
the digging


532
00:28:39.958 --> 00:28:41.685
or there will be
a giant T-Rex unleashed.


533
00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:42.932
But we need to do this
in time for Amy


534
00:28:42.934 --> 00:28:45.108
to go back
to the sacred burial ground


535
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.645
but it has to be timed
with a ray of light,


536
00:28:46.647 --> 00:28:48.980
so she can return back
to her former existence.


537
00:28:48.982 --> 00:28:50.325
Did I miss anything?
(whimpers)


538
00:28:50.327 --> 00:28:51.541
You got it, Dad.

539
00:28:51.543 --> 00:28:53.748
Everything else
in this park is fake,


540
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.981
why did a dinosaur
have to be real?


541
00:28:56.983 --> 00:29:00.535
Dad, Mom, may I offer
some parenting tips?


542
00:29:03.063 --> 00:29:05.268
You raised us
to be kind, caring,


543
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.636
and always wanting
to help someone in need.


544
00:29:07.638 --> 00:29:11.573
And that is why we often
get into situations.


545
00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:13.076
Well, we're in one now,

546
00:29:13.078 --> 00:29:15.160
and Amy's
also our friend.

Thanks for reminding us
what this family stands for.


548

Come on, give it up.

Hey, you guys
over there.

00:36:16.406 --> 00:36:19.571
I have an idea.
It's sort of dangerous.


644
00:36:19.573 --> 00:36:21.621
Everything right now
is sort of dangerous.


645
00:36:21.623 --> 00:36:23.029
Runt, blurt it out.

646
00:36:23.031 --> 00:36:25.365
Amy, birds are
your descendents, right?


647
00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:27.829
Yes, but I can't
fly out of here.


648
00:36:27.831 --> 00:36:30.068
And is T-Rex
from the bird family too?


649
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.637
Yes...

650
00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:33.876
That Rex is not my brother.

651
00:36:33.878 --> 00:36:37.141
We just have to get him
close to the fountain...


652
00:36:37.143 --> 00:36:39.765
I see.
And the music will hold him.


653
00:36:39.767 --> 00:36:41.876
Yes! Long enough
for the ray of light


654
00:36:41.878 --> 00:36:42.867
to hit that spot.

655
00:36:42.869 --> 00:36:44.244
But how do we know

656
00:36:44.246 --> 00:36:45.748
when the music
will come on again?


657
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.405
I'll just have him
chase me till it does.


658
00:36:48.407 --> 00:36:51.447
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

659
00:36:55.831 --> 00:36:57.175
Paddy, we have
to help her.


660
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:01.620
Hey, brother.
You know what they say...


661
00:37:01.622 --> 00:37:04.374
- birds of a feather...
- (roaring)


662
00:37:06.486 --> 00:37:07.640
We gotta help.

663
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.223
<i>(wolves barking)</i>

665
00:37:16.247 --> 00:37:17.332
Hey, Pups.

666
00:37:17.334 --> 00:37:19.636
Do that thing
with the dust.


667
00:37:19.638 --> 00:37:21.203

668

<i>(music playing)</i>

670
00:37:25.879 --> 00:37:29.460

<i>âª Every day... âª</i>

684
00:38:02.037 --> 00:38:05.396
This place
is really twisted.


685

<i>âª We found a way âª</i>

689
00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:17.333
The light has come through.

690
00:38:17.335 --> 00:38:18.932
Amy! The light!

691
00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:22.356
I can't stop dancing.

692
00:38:22.358 --> 00:38:25.204
I see it.
But I got the music in me.


693
00:38:25.206 --> 00:38:28.180
<i>âª Oh, baby

696
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.741
Runt: Why can't you
just stay with us, Amy?


697
00:38:42.743 --> 00:38:44.212
Because, Runt,

698
00:38:44.214 --> 00:38:46.228
if I don't go back
to the sacred ground,


699
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.692
my spirit will
eventually perish.


700
00:38:48.694 --> 00:38:52.149
That is the only place
where I can live on.


701
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:55.891
Claudette: I guess, we should
start saying our good-byes then.


702
00:38:55.893 --> 00:39:00.083
Yes, good-bye will occur
in some form today for sure.


703
00:39:00.085 --> 00:39:01.110
(snarling)

704
00:39:02.551 --> 00:39:03.704
Stinky:
<i>Faster, Amy!</i>


705
00:39:05.687 --> 00:39:07.605
Claudette:
Amy, remember the spin out?


706
00:39:07.607 --> 00:39:09.204
Where my tail hit you?

707
00:39:09.206 --> 00:39:11.028
Yes. Okay,
when I say now,


708
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.115
spin out.

709
00:39:12.117 --> 00:39:14.454
Oh, crickets.
I'll try.


710
00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:16.819
Claudette:
<i>Now!</i>


711
00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:17.942
Oh!

712
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.086
(roaring)

713
00:39:32.151 --> 00:39:34.452
Amy, hurry!

714
00:39:34.454 --> 00:39:37.015
Okay, I'm ready
to go back.


715
00:39:39.317 --> 00:39:41.334
(wind whistling)

716
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:47.860
Amy: <i>Stinky,
Claudette, and Runt,</i>


717
00:39:47.862 --> 00:39:50.101
<i>thank you
for your kindness.</i>


718
00:39:50.103 --> 00:39:53.395
You showed me a world
I had only dreamt of seeing.


719
00:39:53.397 --> 00:39:55.763
You have
a wonderful family.


720
00:39:55.765 --> 00:39:58.420
- Good-bye, Amy.
- We'll miss you, Amy.


721
00:39:58.422 --> 00:40:01.108
Runt: We love you, Amy...
forever.


722
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.806
<i>We'll come here often.</i>

723
00:40:19.158 --> 00:40:20.469
Caribou:
<i>Are they gone?</i>


724
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:22.292
In here?

725
00:40:22.294 --> 00:40:24.245
Will you help us
fill in the ground


726
00:40:24.247 --> 00:40:27.893
with those
humongous antlers.


727
00:40:27.895 --> 00:40:29.079
Both:
Gladly.


728
00:40:30.134 --> 00:40:31.894
(rumbling)

729
00:40:45.462 --> 00:40:48.340
Someone is helping us
fill in the ground.


730
00:40:48.342 --> 00:40:50.387
Perhaps it's nature.

731
00:40:50.389 --> 00:40:51.956
Okay, guys.

732
00:40:51.958 --> 00:40:53.780
As if we've never disturbed
this area


733
00:40:53.782 --> 00:40:55.859
in the first place.

734
00:40:55.861 --> 00:40:57.590
(shovels scraping)

735
00:41:09.462 --> 00:41:12.631
Now, we will never disturb
nature again.


736
00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:22.772
Mom and Dad,

737
00:41:22.774 --> 00:41:24.851
I thought you said
it would be safer here.


738
00:41:24.853 --> 00:41:27.923
It was,
until it wasn't.


739
00:41:27.925 --> 00:41:29.363
No one back home

740
00:41:29.365 --> 00:41:31.254
will ever believe
what just happened.


741
00:41:33.174 --> 00:41:35.060
So, pups, your mom and I

742
00:41:35.062 --> 00:41:37.939
are completely aligned
on this,


743
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:39.508
what do you say
we go home?


744
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.835
Our real home.
Our natural home.


745
00:41:42.837 --> 00:41:44.755
Pups:
Yeah! Awesome!


746
00:41:44.757 --> 00:41:45.716
(Kate chuckles)

747
00:41:45.718 --> 00:41:47.061
But remember, Pups,

748
00:41:47.063 --> 00:41:48.532
when we get back there

749
00:41:48.534 --> 00:41:50.644
we'll have to watch out
for rogue wolves again.


750
00:41:50.646 --> 00:41:52.691
Claudette: Mom, we
just took on a T-Rex.


751
00:41:52.693 --> 00:41:53.908
We can handle
rogue wolves.


752
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:55.253
Stinky:
Yeah, Mom.


753
00:41:55.255 --> 00:41:57.332
Did you see how big
that T-Rex was?


754
00:41:57.334 --> 00:42:01.236
- Runt: It was a pretty awesome <i>situation.</i>
- <i>(Kate giggles)</i>


755
00:42:01.238 --> 00:42:02.516
<i>You're right, pups.</i>

756
00:42:02.518 --> 00:42:04.375
Humphrey:
<i>Let's get home.</i>


757
