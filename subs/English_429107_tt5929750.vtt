00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:47.803
Hey, what is it?

2
00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:49.004
Lola, no.

3
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.807
Shh, shh.

4
00:01:54.378 --> 00:01:56.044
Shh, shh.

5
00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:58.013
Shh, shh,

6
00:01:58.015 --> 00:01:59.581
Lola, Lola.

7
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.616
<i>Tranquila.</i>

8
00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:57.939
Lola, why do you?

9
00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:12.514
<i>Buenos Dias,</i> Suzanne.

10
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:18.119
Kim, look at you,
you look great.


11
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:20.155
I'm gonna set up, okay?

12
00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:22.591
It'll take two seconds.

13
00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:47.983
- Take a deep breath.
- Uh-hmm.


14
00:04:47.985 --> 00:04:50.552
All the way down.

15
00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:52.721
Let it fill your stomach

16
00:04:52.723 --> 00:04:55.524
and then expand into your lungs.

17
00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:57.526
Hold it.

18
00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:58.793
Hold it.

19
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.665
Release.

20
00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.568
You almost get
a little high, huh?


21
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:46.575
Hi, Suzanne, I'm so late.

22
00:05:46.577 --> 00:05:47.909
I have to drive
to Newport beach.


23
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:49.311
<i>Mucho traffico?</i>

24
00:06:35.658 --> 00:06:37.359
I'm going to the Birkhofers.

25
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.994
Kathy Birkhofer is my client.

26
00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:42.230
- Your name?
- Beatriz Luna.


27
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.033
Thank you.

28
00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:31.079
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming up during rush hour.


29
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:32.380
Was it awful?

30
00:07:32.382 --> 00:07:34.082
Yeah. That's why
I'm a little late.


31
00:07:34.084 --> 00:07:35.383
Sorry, the traffic was terrible.

32
00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:37.085
Oh, don't worry about it.

33
00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:38.953
I just have to be done by 6:00.
I have to get my face on.


34
00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:41.322
That's right, you're having a party.
How wonderful.


35
00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:43.858
Just a little dinner party,
you know, a few people,


36
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.427
but I'm so glad
you could make it.


37
00:07:45.429 --> 00:07:48.763
Tara's loving college,

38
00:07:48.765 --> 00:07:50.231
so many interesting people.

39
00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:51.299
It's very diverse.

40
00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:53.001
Gays and trans

41
00:07:53.003 --> 00:07:55.236
and people from all over.

42
00:07:55.238 --> 00:07:58.373
Her roommate is
a Jewish girl from New York.


43
00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:00.742
She's just having
a great experience.


44
00:08:00.744 --> 00:08:02.377
That's awesome.
I need to call her.


45
00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:03.845
I miss Tara.

46
00:08:03.847 --> 00:08:06.748
I'm just so relieved
because, you know,


47
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.817
I mean, all I knew
was the place was in Ohio,


48
00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:11.152
and I just couldn't imagine
why she'd want to leave here


49
00:08:11.154 --> 00:08:14.189
and spend four years
of her life in Ohio.


50
00:08:15.224 --> 00:08:17.125
How are you, Beatriz?

51
00:08:18.294 --> 00:08:20.361
I'm okay.

52
00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:23.031
What? Only okay?

53
00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:24.499
What's wrong?

54
00:08:27.036 --> 00:08:28.903
My goat.

55
00:08:30.473 --> 00:08:33.408
My neighbor complained
about my goat.


56
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.880
This neighbor, he's crazy.

57
00:08:38.882 --> 00:08:41.883
He's always drinking and angry.

58
00:08:41.885 --> 00:08:44.786
He came to my house
at 11:00 at night


59
00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:48.757
and he said that they were gonna
come and take away my goats.


60
00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:49.824
Who were?

61
00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:51.192
The city, you know.

62
00:08:51.194 --> 00:08:53.762
Because they think
they're nuisance animals.


63
00:08:53.764 --> 00:08:55.330
It's not zoned for goats.

64
00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:56.431
Oh, right.

65
00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:58.933
They run to me when I come home.

66
00:08:58.935 --> 00:09:03.872
They're so happy to see me,
but they bleat a lot.


67
00:09:03.874 --> 00:09:06.107
So I bring them in the house

68
00:09:06.109 --> 00:09:08.510
and I make them
a little pen in my bedroom.


69
00:09:08.512 --> 00:09:12.347
But last Saturday
I let them out,


70
00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:16.017
and Hercules, he likes
to burrow near the house...


71
00:09:20.422 --> 00:09:23.091
But Jeronimo...

72
00:09:26.028 --> 00:09:27.395
Beatriz?

73
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.034
Oh, no.

74
00:09:33.036 --> 00:09:34.469
What happened?

75
00:09:37.907 --> 00:09:39.407
He killed my goat.

76
00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:42.110
What?

77
00:09:42.112 --> 00:09:43.244
Who, your neighbor?

78
00:09:43.246 --> 00:09:44.512
I came back from the walk,

79
00:09:44.514 --> 00:09:47.916
and Jeronimo was dead
in the garden.


80
00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:49.417
His neck was broken.

81
00:09:49.419 --> 00:09:51.820
Are you serious?

82
00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:54.189
And I could feel his pain.

83
00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:56.191
He was already dead.

84
00:09:56.193 --> 00:09:59.027
I could still feel his pain.

85
00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:03.598
I held him
when he was a little baby.


86
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.268
He was such a fun personality.

87
00:10:18.113 --> 00:10:19.581
I'm sorry.

88
00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:22.350
I didn't mean to upset you
right before your party.


89
00:10:22.352 --> 00:10:24.118
I will burn some Sage.

90
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.287
No, it's okay, Beatriz.

91
00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:28.456
Oh, poor thing.

92
00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:13.968
What happened?

93
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.570
My car is not working.

94
00:11:15.572 --> 00:11:17.972
Oh, no.
Did you call AAA?


95
00:11:17.974 --> 00:11:20.074
No, I called a friend.
He knows how to fix cars.


96
00:11:20.076 --> 00:11:22.543
He's almost done with work, and
then he's gonna come and help me.


97
00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:25.013
- He's fixed it before.
- From Altadena?


98
00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:26.681
He doesn't mind, he's my friend.

99
00:11:26.683 --> 00:11:29.450
Right, but how long do you think
it'll take him to get here?


100
00:11:29.452 --> 00:11:33.454
He has to finish work
and there might be traffic.


101
00:11:33.456 --> 00:11:35.957
Well, you can
just stay for dinner.


102
00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:38.326
It's just a work thing,
is the only thing.


103
00:11:38.328 --> 00:11:40.261
- Ah, no.
- Let me talk to Grant.


104
00:11:40.263 --> 00:11:41.996
No, I can just wait anywhere.

105
00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:43.531
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It should be fine.


106
00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:45.233
I can even wait
in the car if you want.


107
00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:46.701
Don't be silly.

108
00:11:46.703 --> 00:11:48.202
I have a book I can read.

109
00:11:48.204 --> 00:11:50.238
Let me talk to Grant,
it should be fine.


110
00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:05.653
- This looks amazing.
- Thank you.


111
00:12:11.994 --> 00:12:13.661
She needs to be at the
clinic in the morning.


112
00:12:13.663 --> 00:12:15.096
She doesn't wanna
leave the car here.


113
00:12:15.098 --> 00:12:16.264
Grant, I don't
have time for this.


114
00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:17.532
I've got to get ready.

115
00:12:17.534 --> 00:12:20.168
It's Doug Strutt.
It's work, Kathy.


116
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.003
So is it a big deal?

117
00:12:22.005 --> 00:12:23.304
Uh, yeah.

118
00:12:23.306 --> 00:12:24.539
I told her she could
have dinner here.


119
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:26.307
So what do you want me to do?

120
00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:28.109
Do you want me to have her eat
in the TV room by herself?


121
00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:31.045
- Yeah.
- Really?


122
00:12:31.047 --> 00:12:32.714
- Why not?
- Because I'm not gonna do that,


123
00:12:32.716 --> 00:12:35.116
because she's not
a housekeeper or something.


124
00:12:35.118 --> 00:12:37.018
- She's a friend of the family.
- She is?


125
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.420
Grant, she did so much for Tara.

126
00:12:39.422 --> 00:12:40.755
She's had a horrible week.

127
00:12:40.757 --> 00:12:42.590
Her neighbor strangled her goat.

128
00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:45.226
- Okay, fine.
- So it's one extra person at dinner, so what?


129
00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:46.627
- She's the sweetest.
- I said fine.


130
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:49.297
- I've got to get ready.
- Then fucking get ready.


131
00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:02.577
- Hi.
- Hi.


132
00:13:05.347 --> 00:13:06.481
Beatriz?

133
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.585
Ah. It's all okay, Beatriz.
We want you to stay.


134
00:13:10.587 --> 00:13:12.387
Are you okay
with what you're wearing?


135
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:13.488
How do you feel?

136
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.756
Maybe I have
a sweater or a blouse,


137
00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:16.124
or maybe Tara has something.

138
00:13:16.126 --> 00:13:17.325
But you're fine however,

139
00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:19.427
I just... I'm just
running so late.


140
00:14:11.413 --> 00:14:13.314
You have the champagne?

141
00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:15.550
Yes.

142
00:14:15.552 --> 00:14:18.686
Should we leave the keys
in case they wanna move the car?


143
00:14:18.688 --> 00:14:21.489
I'll put them on the seat.
It's safe, right?


144
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:24.725
Babe, we've been through,
like, three security gates.


145
00:14:24.727 --> 00:14:27.361
Oh, this gravel.

146
00:14:30.332 --> 00:14:32.867
- Hi, come in. Welcome.
- Hello.


147
00:14:32.869 --> 00:14:33.869
Thank you.

148
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.472
Kathy and Grant
will be down any second.


149
00:14:37.474 --> 00:14:39.874
This is for them. It's for
everyone, it's for all of us.


150
00:14:39.876 --> 00:14:41.609
Great, I'll make sure
to get it to them.


151
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:43.177
Can I offer either
of you an aperitif?


152
00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:45.313
I'll have a vodka soda
with a splash of cran.


153
00:14:45.315 --> 00:14:47.115
Okay, any preference on vodka?

154
00:14:47.117 --> 00:14:48.783
Stoli, Grey goose,
whatever you have.


155
00:14:48.785 --> 00:14:51.853
- Uh, we have both.
- Grey goose.


156
00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:55.256
- Uh, Jack and coke.
- Jack and coke, perfect.


157
00:14:55.258 --> 00:14:57.125
- Dude.
- -What?


158
00:14:57.127 --> 00:14:59.560
- It's hitting me.
- What?


159
00:14:59.562 --> 00:15:01.629
- We're gonna be fucking rich.
- Oh, shut up.


160
00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:03.131
Yeah, we're gonna
be fucking rich.


161
00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:04.365
- Really?
- Yeah.


162
00:15:04.367 --> 00:15:05.733
I'm gonna be making
more than you now.


163
00:15:05.735 --> 00:15:07.335
- How do you like that?
- We'll see.


164
00:15:07.337 --> 00:15:09.504
Are you the plus one tonight
or am I the plus one?


165
00:15:09.506 --> 00:15:11.572
- Okay, I'm the plus one.
- That's what I thought.


166
00:15:11.574 --> 00:15:14.251
So you must be very
attracted to me right now.


167
00:15:14.276 --> 00:15:15.276
Kind of.

168
00:15:15.278 --> 00:15:16.844
- A little bit?
- A little bit.


169
00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:19.447
Just don't leave me stuck
with the wives all night, okay?


170
00:15:19.449 --> 00:15:20.548
- Uh-hmm.
- You promise?


171
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.716
- Somebody's here.
- Oh.


172
00:15:21.718 --> 00:15:23.351
- Hi. I'm Beatriz.
- Hi.


173
00:15:23.353 --> 00:15:25.520
Hi, I'm... hi.

174
00:15:25.522 --> 00:15:27.255
I'm Shannon, this is Alex.

175
00:15:27.257 --> 00:15:28.256
- Hi.
- Hi.


176
00:15:28.258 --> 00:15:31.726
Shannon, Alex, okay.

177
00:15:31.728 --> 00:15:34.395
So, uh, you're at... where are you?
You're at Virident?


178
00:15:34.397 --> 00:15:36.364
- No.
- No.


179
00:15:36.366 --> 00:15:39.567
Um, how do you...
How do you know Kathy and Grant?


180
00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:41.369
I know them through Tara.

181
00:15:41.371 --> 00:15:44.739
I'm a health therapist.
I do massage, sound therapy...


182
00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:47.275
- Got you.
- Reiki, Tai chi, nutrition.


183
00:15:47.277 --> 00:15:49.944
So you're a nutritionist?
Alex has kidney stones.


184
00:15:49.946 --> 00:15:52.847
Yeah, I mean, apparently just like
crystals form in my urine, you know,


185
00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:54.882
which is apparently not
that uncommon, right, babe?


186
00:15:54.884 --> 00:15:56.350
Oh, no, that's horrible.

187
00:15:56.352 --> 00:15:57.852
Yeah, the worst.
Not fun.


188
00:15:57.854 --> 00:15:59.420
No, I thought he was dying.

189
00:15:59.422 --> 00:16:01.289
I mean, I didn't know
what was happening.


190
00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:02.857
He fell to the ground.
I called for the kids.


191
00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:04.725
I mean, I don't know
what I was thinking.


192
00:16:04.727 --> 00:16:07.261
I guess I wanted them to maybe
just say goodbye to their father.


193
00:16:07.263 --> 00:16:09.230
Yeah, they were traumatized.

194
00:16:09.232 --> 00:16:11.399
He was lying on the ground screaming.
I was hysterical.


195
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:14.302
The kids didn't know what the
hell was going on. It was awful.


196
00:16:14.304 --> 00:16:16.270
Grey goose, splash of cran,

197
00:16:16.272 --> 00:16:17.605
- and Jack and coke.
- Thank you.


198
00:16:17.607 --> 00:16:19.941
- Can I get you anything?
- Just water.


199
00:16:19.943 --> 00:16:22.677
- Are you sure?
- Is there any wine?


200
00:16:22.679 --> 00:16:25.313
Of course, yeah, red or white?

201
00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:26.948
Maybe a little white wine.

202
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.950
Okay, a little bit of white.

203
00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:31.752
You shouldn't be drinking
if you have kidney stones.


204
00:16:31.754 --> 00:16:33.988
- I know, I know, but tonight...
- You can drink


205
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.791
whatever you want
tonight, okay, babe?


206
00:16:36.793 --> 00:16:38.826
I mean, Alex is the reason
why we're celebrating.


207
00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:41.862
Alex got the legislator
to approve the development.


208
00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:45.233
- It all passed today.
- It wasn't just me, took a lot of people.


209
00:16:45.235 --> 00:16:47.435
Takes a village,
that's what they say.


210
00:16:47.437 --> 00:16:49.837
He's being modest.
It was a huge deal.


211
00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:51.939
I mean, nobody thought
it was gonna pass.


212
00:16:51.941 --> 00:16:54.709
I had to fellate every single
state senator in California.


213
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:56.310
- Oh, my god.
- A lot of guys.


214
00:16:56.312 --> 00:16:58.980
Do you know what's great
for kidney stones?


215
00:16:58.982 --> 00:17:03.618
Apple cider vinegar, beets,
rhubarb, and dandelion root.


216
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.653
Mm, dandelion root,
babe, your favorite.


217
00:17:05.655 --> 00:17:08.623
Yeah, I love it. Anything else?
Anything edible?


218
00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.324
It was a joke.

219
00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:31.579
Doug is here.

220
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:33.347
Okay, great.

221
00:17:33.349 --> 00:17:34.882
- He's at the gate.
- Wonderful.


222
00:17:34.884 --> 00:17:36.717
Alex and Shannon are downstairs.

223
00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:39.320
- Terrific.
- It's 6:13, Kathy.


224
00:17:39.322 --> 00:17:40.721
Perfect.
I'll be right down.


225
00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:22.063
- Welcome.
- Hey.


226
00:18:22.065 --> 00:18:23.764
- Hello.
- Hi, guys.


227
00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:25.866
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.


228
00:18:25.868 --> 00:18:28.069
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.


229
00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:30.471
- You look fantastic.
- Oh, so do you.


230
00:18:30.473 --> 00:18:31.872
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi, Grant.


231
00:18:31.874 --> 00:18:33.441
Welcome.
How are you?


232
00:18:33.443 --> 00:18:34.642
Remember Shannon?

233
00:18:34.644 --> 00:18:37.078
- Shannon.
- Hi, how are you?


234
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.780
Hi, Alex.
Jeana.


235
00:18:40.982 --> 00:18:43.517
Shannon. Hi.

236
00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:46.987
- Love your tunic.
- Thank you. It's Jenny Bellane.


237
00:18:46.989 --> 00:18:49.790
Nice work, Alex.
Hail the conquering hero.


238
00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:51.125
Only took a year and a half.

239
00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:52.560
Faster than some, right?

240
00:18:52.562 --> 00:18:54.028
Faster than most,
are you kidding?


241
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.564
I knew her back when she had
that little shop in balboa.


242
00:18:56.566 --> 00:18:58.099
Oh, my god, I was her roommate.

243
00:18:58.101 --> 00:19:00.000
We lived together
for just like a month.


244
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:10.478
Listen, I told Cal
about tonight,


245
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.080
but he's got this deposition
tomorrow morning. Lawsuit.


246
00:19:13.082 --> 00:19:16.384
I'm such a klutz on heels. I almost just
broke my ankle out there on the gravel.


247
00:19:16.386 --> 00:19:18.452
- Oh, don't sue.
- I won't.


248
00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:20.121
Let's get you a drink.

249
00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:37.805
Hi, guys.

250
00:19:40.108 --> 00:19:43.844
- Oh, not even...
- It's great.


251
00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:46.847
Oh, I love succulents.
Those are my favorite.


252
00:19:46.849 --> 00:19:48.115
Oh, I know. I do too.

253
00:19:48.117 --> 00:19:51.051
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Evan.


254
00:19:51.053 --> 00:19:52.920
Thank you.

255
00:19:52.922 --> 00:19:55.923
He's also a very talented, um...

256
00:19:55.925 --> 00:19:57.658
What do you call it...

257
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.027
Beatriz, oh, my god.

258
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:01.562
I'm so rude.

259
00:20:01.564 --> 00:20:03.831
Shannon, Jeana, this is
my dear friend Beatriz.


260
00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:04.932
- Oh.
- We met inside.


261
00:20:04.934 --> 00:20:06.534
- Oh, good.
- Hi.


262
00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:09.904
Nice to meet you.
You're so beautiful.


263
00:20:09.906 --> 00:20:11.605
- Thank you.
- You all are.


264
00:20:11.607 --> 00:20:12.907
Beatriz is a healer.

265
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:14.108
I am not even joking.

266
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.576
She is a miracle worker.

267
00:20:15.578 --> 00:20:16.877
We met at the Ardendale center.

268
00:20:16.879 --> 00:20:18.479
Do you guys know
the Ardendale center?


269
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:20.781
- Huh-uh.
- It's a cancer...


270
00:20:20.783 --> 00:20:22.783
Well, it's everything,
but mostly cancer.


271
00:20:22.785 --> 00:20:23.884
It's very food centered,

272
00:20:23.886 --> 00:20:25.653
a lot of alternative therapies.

273
00:20:25.655 --> 00:20:27.488
It's... it's near Santa Monica.

274
00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.958
We went up there when Tara was
diagnosed with Hodgkin's.


275
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.060
- Oh, my god.
- Cancer? I had no idea.


276
00:20:33.062 --> 00:20:34.762
Yeah, she had it in her thymus,

277
00:20:34.764 --> 00:20:36.096
she had it in her spleen,

278
00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:37.832
it was in the lining
above her diaphragm.


279
00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:38.933
It was really scary.

280
00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:40.501
- Sure.
- Of course.


281
00:20:40.503 --> 00:20:41.669
And she was 15.

282
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:43.904
So I had to educate
myself completely,


283
00:20:43.906 --> 00:20:46.874
every doctor, every drug.

284
00:20:46.876 --> 00:20:48.008
And Grant is very left brain.

285
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.743
He's very by-the-book western,

286
00:20:49.745 --> 00:20:53.681
so of course we did the whole
surgery-chemo-radiation,


287
00:20:53.683 --> 00:20:56.116
and Tara ended up n.E.D.

288
00:20:56.118 --> 00:20:58.118
She's fine, thank god.

289
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.520
But after the chemo,

290
00:20:59.522 --> 00:21:01.188
she had no strength.

291
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.058
She wasn't eating,
and I'd heard about Ardendale.


292
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.994
So we went down there,
and she just took to it.


293
00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:08.696
She loved the food.

294
00:21:08.698 --> 00:21:10.965
She loved the therapies.

295
00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:12.266
And we met Beatriz.

296
00:21:12.268 --> 00:21:14.635
And Beatriz and Tara
just hit it off.


297
00:21:14.637 --> 00:21:16.003
I love Tara.

298
00:21:16.005 --> 00:21:18.572
So then I started
using her, and Grant too,


299
00:21:18.574 --> 00:21:19.740
mostly just for massages.

300
00:21:19.742 --> 00:21:21.575
We're linked, you know.

301
00:21:21.577 --> 00:21:22.977
I think spiritually linked.

302
00:21:22.979 --> 00:21:25.079
The first time I met her,

303
00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:27.915
it was like I recognized her

304
00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:29.116
just by the eyes.

305
00:21:29.118 --> 00:21:30.684
Recognized her as what?

306
00:21:31.753 --> 00:21:33.754
Maybe my mother in another life,

307
00:21:33.756 --> 00:21:36.023
or my daughter.

308
00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:38.225
You have unfinished business
with someone,


309
00:21:38.227 --> 00:21:39.894
and then in the next life,

310
00:21:39.896 --> 00:21:41.829
they come back
in a different form.


311
00:21:41.831 --> 00:21:43.998
I love psychic stuff.

312
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.066
Oh, I let this gypsy
steal $2,000


313
00:21:46.068 --> 00:21:48.068
from me once.
It was so humiliating.


314
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.904
Tara is an old soul.

315
00:21:49.906 --> 00:21:53.941
She cares so much
about animals and nature.


316
00:21:53.943 --> 00:21:55.609
The earth needs old souls

317
00:21:55.611 --> 00:21:57.745
because, you know,
it is very sick.


318
00:21:57.747 --> 00:22:01.582
And the old souls must help us

319
00:22:01.584 --> 00:22:03.884
find a way to heal the earth.

320
00:22:03.886 --> 00:22:05.586
That's a big responsibility.

321
00:22:05.588 --> 00:22:06.687
Yeah.

322
00:22:09.157 --> 00:22:11.992
Have you guys seen
the pictures of Zoey Mars?


323
00:22:11.994 --> 00:22:13.894
- Yes.
- What is that about?


324
00:22:13.896 --> 00:22:16.931
Doug and I were looking at them on
the way over. We almost threw up.


325
00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:18.699
Where is that girl's mother,
I wanna know.


326
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:20.067
What... what happened?

327
00:22:20.069 --> 00:22:22.269
Oh, it's this reality star.
She's a...


328
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:25.005
- She has a clothing line.
- Tween singer.


329
00:22:25.007 --> 00:22:28.175
And her phone got hacked, so there's
these pictures all over the Internet


330
00:22:28.177 --> 00:22:31.211
that she apparently sent her
gynecologist of her vagina.


331
00:22:31.213 --> 00:22:33.013
- Oh.
- Poor girl.


332
00:22:33.015 --> 00:22:35.950
- She has herpes, yeah.
- It's awful.


333
00:22:35.952 --> 00:22:40.187
So she has all these crusty red
inflamed sores all over her vagina.


334
00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:41.822
How do they know
it's her vagina?


335
00:22:41.824 --> 00:22:43.958
Because you can see
her face in the photos.


336
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.126
- How can you be so stupid?
- It's really sad, actually.


337
00:22:46.128 --> 00:22:48.195
- I mean, she was hacked.
- Well, her career's over.


338
00:22:48.197 --> 00:22:51.365
I mean, if you
see the pictures...


339
00:22:51.367 --> 00:22:53.167
You wanna see the pictures?

340
00:22:53.169 --> 00:22:55.035
I still have to eat.

341
00:22:55.037 --> 00:22:57.771
No. No, no.
I... no.


342
00:22:59.074 --> 00:23:01.342
Oh, my god.

343
00:23:06.348 --> 00:23:08.282
In a way, it's kind of amazing.

344
00:23:08.284 --> 00:23:09.850
Mm-hmm.

345
00:23:21.296 --> 00:23:23.330
Grant, honey,
I'm gonna give the girls


346
00:23:23.332 --> 00:23:25.099
- a little tour.
- Sounds good.


347
00:23:58.099 --> 00:24:00.868
Jesus, Doug. That one
goes in the memoirs.


348
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.303
It's going in the memoirs.
I'm writing a memoir.


349
00:24:03.305 --> 00:24:05.873
- Bullshit, really?
- Yeah, we got a deal with random house.


350
00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:08.075
Just got to get around
to writing it.


351
00:24:08.077 --> 00:24:10.411
But I'm always coming up
with titles.


352
00:24:10.413 --> 00:24:13.380
- You wanna hear some?
- Hell, yeah. -Of course, hit me.


353
00:24:13.382 --> 00:24:16.250
<i>Life is a game
and guess who won.</i>


354
00:24:16.252 --> 00:24:17.885
Big picture of me on the cover.

355
00:24:17.887 --> 00:24:19.453
- I love it.
- Done. That's it.


356
00:24:19.455 --> 00:24:22.122
And... and this is good.
<i>You're in my way, asshole.</i>


357
00:24:22.124 --> 00:24:23.891
<i>A memoir by Doug Strutt.</i>

358
00:24:25.927 --> 00:24:27.327
<i>How to make a billion dollars</i>

359
00:24:27.329 --> 00:24:28.462
<i>without going to prison</i>

360
00:24:28.464 --> 00:24:29.963
<i>except for one time</i>

361
00:24:29.965 --> 00:24:31.899
<i>and I was innocent and besides,</i>

362
00:24:31.901 --> 00:24:34.101
<i>everyone else was doing it.</i>

363
00:24:34.103 --> 00:24:36.336
- That's hilarious.
- That's a best seller.


364
00:24:36.338 --> 00:24:38.939
Here is the best title
for a memoir.


365
00:24:38.941 --> 00:24:40.974
<i>This can't possibly end well.</i>

366
00:24:40.976 --> 00:24:42.276
Oh, my god.

367
00:24:42.278 --> 00:24:43.777
Guys, um, before dinner,

368
00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:45.479
I just wanted to give
you a little heads up.


369
00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:48.248
Can I get another bourbon, hon?

370
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.983
Oh, no, no, Doug.

371
00:24:49.985 --> 00:24:52.386
This is, uh, this is Beatriz.

372
00:24:52.388 --> 00:24:54.154
I'm sorry you
weren't introduced.


373
00:24:54.156 --> 00:24:56.056
She's our guest.
She's staying for dinner.


374
00:24:56.058 --> 00:24:58.492
Oh, okay.
You were hovering.


375
00:24:58.494 --> 00:25:01.028
I just figured
you were part of the staff.


376
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.796
- I'll go get you a drink.
- Oh, thanks.


377
00:25:02.798 --> 00:25:05.265
- Alex?
- Uh, Jack and coke.


378
00:25:06.301 --> 00:25:08.435
Can I have another?

379
00:25:08.437 --> 00:25:10.337
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:11.905
Uh, wine?

381
00:25:21.983 --> 00:25:23.951
So, where are you from?

382
00:25:23.953 --> 00:25:25.119
Altadena.

383
00:25:25.121 --> 00:25:26.420
Ah.

384
00:25:26.422 --> 00:25:27.888
Where are you really from?

385
00:25:29.157 --> 00:25:32.392
I was born
in Tlaltecuhtli, Mexico.


386
00:25:32.394 --> 00:25:34.194
Tlaltecuhtli.

387
00:25:34.196 --> 00:25:36.063
Tlaltecuhtli.

388
00:25:36.065 --> 00:25:37.197
Tlaltecuhtli.

389
00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:38.766
On the pacific.

390
00:25:38.768 --> 00:25:40.100
It was very beautiful once.

391
00:25:40.102 --> 00:25:42.503
Mexico is awesome.
I love Cancun.


392
00:25:42.505 --> 00:25:45.973
But now many hotels, timeshares.

393
00:25:45.975 --> 00:25:48.776
A lot of crime, I think.

394
00:25:48.778 --> 00:25:49.977
And where are you from?

395
00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:51.044
Laguna.

396
00:25:51.046 --> 00:25:53.413
But we have houses in...

397
00:25:53.415 --> 00:25:55.883
Well, we're all over.

398
00:25:55.885 --> 00:25:58.218
But where are you really from?

399
00:25:59.521 --> 00:26:01.822
I was born in Oaxaca.

400
00:26:05.394 --> 00:26:08.128
No, no, I was born in San Diego.

401
00:26:10.398 --> 00:26:12.332
Now I've got the giggles.

402
00:26:13.935 --> 00:26:15.936
Do I know you?

403
00:26:15.938 --> 00:26:17.471
Oh, Doug's famous.

404
00:26:17.473 --> 00:26:18.539
He's been on the news.

405
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:20.207
You know, he's a mogul.

406
00:26:20.209 --> 00:26:23.076
I have opinions and because
I have money, people listen.


407
00:26:24.412 --> 00:26:27.114
I don't know why,
but I think I know you.


408
00:26:27.116 --> 00:26:28.982
Well, maybe.

409
00:26:28.984 --> 00:26:31.185
Ever dance in Vegas?

410
00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:36.924
Excuse me.

411
00:26:43.131 --> 00:26:45.065
And this is Tara's room.

412
00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:46.333
Oh, pretty.

413
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.170
Lucky girl.

414
00:26:50.172 --> 00:26:51.572
Yeah.

415
00:26:51.574 --> 00:26:52.840
- Oh!
- Aw.


416
00:26:52.842 --> 00:26:54.575
That was her last summer.

417
00:26:54.577 --> 00:26:57.344
Oh. Oh...

418
00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.513
- Beautiful eyes.
- All grown up.


419
00:26:59.515 --> 00:27:03.917
Yeah. And this is her
while she was in treatment.


420
00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:05.452
She had to have
so many rounds of chemo.


421
00:27:05.454 --> 00:27:07.087
It was awful, almost killed her.

422
00:27:07.089 --> 00:27:08.488
- Seriously?
- Oh, my god.


423
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.190
- Yeah.
- And that's Beatriz?


424
00:27:10.192 --> 00:27:11.625
Yes!

425
00:27:11.627 --> 00:27:14.962
During her recovery,
Beatriz was so helpful.


426
00:27:14.964 --> 00:27:16.630
I'm telling you,
this woman is a Saint.


427
00:27:16.632 --> 00:27:18.332
It's like birds
fly out of the sky


428
00:27:18.334 --> 00:27:19.399
and land on her shoulder.

429
00:27:19.401 --> 00:27:21.034
Oh, it's like snow white.

430
00:27:21.036 --> 00:27:22.169
We had a baby nurse like that.

431
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:23.637
When she left,
Alex and I sobbed.


432
00:27:23.639 --> 00:27:26.006
- Really? -"Oh, now we're
gonna have to get up


433
00:27:26.008 --> 00:27:28.008
in the middle of the night
and hold the baby."


434
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.344
Kidding. We loved her.

435
00:27:30.346 --> 00:27:32.145
She was like a member
of the family.


436
00:27:32.147 --> 00:27:34.147
Well, Beatriz's family
had to leave their home


437
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:36.083
when she was a little girl
in Mexico,


438
00:27:36.085 --> 00:27:38.952
and they were so poor that they all
had to separate from each other.


439
00:27:38.954 --> 00:27:40.888
So she never really knew
her mother,


440
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.590
and then she was raised
by her grandmother,


441
00:27:43.592 --> 00:27:46.159
and then her grandmother died,
and she was all alone.


442
00:27:46.161 --> 00:27:50.998
And then she married a guy here,
and he disappeared...


443
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.299
- God.
- Or got killed.


444
00:27:52.301 --> 00:27:53.533
Kathy.

445
00:27:53.535 --> 00:27:55.636
Hi.

446
00:27:55.638 --> 00:27:58.972
Hi. I'm so sorry,
but my friend that was gonna


447
00:27:58.974 --> 00:28:02.075
fix my VW cannot come
until tomorrow morning.


448
00:28:02.077 --> 00:28:03.543
I don't know what to do.

449
00:28:03.545 --> 00:28:06.380
- Stay here.
- I feel bad.


450
00:28:06.382 --> 00:28:08.682
What? Don't you feel bad.
Don't you ever feel bad.


451
00:28:08.684 --> 00:28:10.517
You can stay right here
in Tara's room.


452
00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:13.420
- Are you sure?
- I insist.


453
00:28:13.422 --> 00:28:15.656
Thank you, Kathy.

454
00:28:15.658 --> 00:28:18.358
The only thing I ask is that
you take one of Tara's guitars


455
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.160
and you sing us
a song after dinner.


456
00:28:20.162 --> 00:28:23.263
Beatriz has the most
incredible singing voice.


457
00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:25.365
I need to call my friend
to stop at my house


458
00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:27.434
and check on my dogs
and my goat.


459
00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:28.502
Oh, yeah. Do that.

460
00:28:30.071 --> 00:28:31.204
Thank you, Kathy.

461
00:28:31.206 --> 00:28:33.006
Stop thanking me.

462
00:28:33.008 --> 00:28:36.109
- Thank you for being here.
- Thank you.


463
00:28:36.111 --> 00:28:39.179
Oh. So sweet.

464
00:28:39.181 --> 00:28:41.381
She has a goat?

465
00:28:45.153 --> 00:28:46.420
When you're ready,

466
00:28:46.422 --> 00:28:48.355
we'd like to invite you
in for dinner.


467
00:28:48.357 --> 00:28:49.489
Oh, great.

468
00:28:54.662 --> 00:28:56.096
I'm glad this worked out.

469
00:28:56.098 --> 00:28:57.597
Doug, I know you have
a busy schedule


470
00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:59.266
and it's so great
that you were in town


471
00:28:59.268 --> 00:29:00.400
when the good news came in

472
00:29:00.402 --> 00:29:01.635
and we were all able
to gather...


473
00:29:01.637 --> 00:29:04.438
Let me just say...
Did I cut you off?


474
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.606
- No, no, go ahead.
- I don't wanna cut off the host.


475
00:29:06.608 --> 00:29:10.344
- All yours.
- Well, first,


476
00:29:10.346 --> 00:29:12.746
I wanna say on behalf
of Jeana and myself,


477
00:29:12.748 --> 00:29:15.983
thank you for having us
at your stunning home.


478
00:29:15.985 --> 00:29:19.086
And of course, to you, Kathy
for helping make this dinner.


479
00:29:19.088 --> 00:29:20.587
You did help make the dinner?

480
00:29:20.589 --> 00:29:22.189
- God. Doug.
- Well, I didn't.


481
00:29:22.191 --> 00:29:24.591
But I did plan the menu,
and I know that sounds easy,


482
00:29:24.593 --> 00:29:26.126
but when you have OCD like I do,

483
00:29:26.128 --> 00:29:27.594
you know it took me
about three weeks.


484
00:29:27.596 --> 00:29:29.262
Catered food is the best food.

485
00:29:29.264 --> 00:29:32.065
Kathy, in all seriousness,
you are the consummate host,


486
00:29:32.067 --> 00:29:34.701
you are a knockout, and if
I wasn't on my third wife,


487
00:29:34.703 --> 00:29:37.070
- I'd steal you away.
- Oh, thank you.


488
00:29:37.072 --> 00:29:39.272
I would personally love
a sister wife. Trust me.


489
00:29:39.274 --> 00:29:43.577
And I couldn't be more pleased
and frankly, surprised


490
00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:46.446
at how smoothly
this whole process has gone,


491
00:29:46.448 --> 00:29:49.716
thanks in large part
to Alex's efforts.


492
00:29:49.718 --> 00:29:50.784
Alex.

493
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.321
And Alex, if any
of those efforts


494
00:29:54.323 --> 00:29:55.789
were illegal, I do not know you

495
00:29:55.791 --> 00:29:57.290
nor was I even here tonight.

496
00:29:57.292 --> 00:29:59.026
Neither was I.
And it's my house.


497
00:29:59.028 --> 00:30:00.660
I hope that
this is the beginning


498
00:30:00.662 --> 00:30:04.031
of a long partnership
between briden and rife.


499
00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:06.500
And I think that we are
all gonna make


500
00:30:06.502 --> 00:30:08.635
a lot of fucking money.

501
00:30:08.637 --> 00:30:10.070
- Yeah.

502
00:30:10.072 --> 00:30:12.139
- Cheers.

503
00:30:12.141 --> 00:30:13.473
Tonight you have a choice

504
00:30:13.475 --> 00:30:15.475
of two entrees.
The chef has prepared...


505
00:30:15.477 --> 00:30:17.411
I would just like to say
to Kathy and Grant


506
00:30:17.413 --> 00:30:19.179
thank you for having me tonight.

507
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:23.517
I know you were not
expecting me, but I love Tara.


508
00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:24.584
I love your family.

509
00:30:24.586 --> 00:30:26.753
And I love being in your house.

510
00:30:26.755 --> 00:30:29.056
And it's an honor
to meet all of you.


511
00:30:29.058 --> 00:30:30.724
Aw, so sweet, thank you.

512
00:30:30.726 --> 00:30:32.692
And I would like
to give you all treatments,


513
00:30:32.694 --> 00:30:35.395
free, of course,
as my way of saying thank you


514
00:30:35.397 --> 00:30:37.431
- for including me tonight.
- Oh, no, Beatriz,


515
00:30:37.433 --> 00:30:39.800
- you don't have to do that.
- A treatment? What do you mean?


516
00:30:39.802 --> 00:30:41.701
She's a masseuse, Doug.
She gives massages.


517
00:30:41.703 --> 00:30:45.072
We're getting free massages?
All of us at the same time?


518
00:30:45.074 --> 00:30:47.607
Oh. You wish, you sicko.

519
00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:49.476
You would have
to come to the center


520
00:30:49.478 --> 00:30:51.578
in Santa Monica.
I have an office.


521
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.580
You have an office?
Good for you.


522
00:30:53.582 --> 00:30:55.148
We have many treatments.

523
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.484
Rolfing, breath therapy...

524
00:30:57.486 --> 00:30:58.785
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

525
00:30:58.787 --> 00:31:00.754
Um, I need to take
everyone's order.


526
00:31:00.756 --> 00:31:04.124
You have a choice of either the grilled
Halibut or the beef tenderloin.


527
00:31:04.126 --> 00:31:06.326
- I'll have the beef.
- I'll have the beef too, please.


528
00:31:06.328 --> 00:31:07.694
- Halibut please.
- Beef.


529
00:31:07.696 --> 00:31:10.464
- Uh, fish for me.
- I'll have the Halibut.


530
00:31:10.466 --> 00:31:13.333
And Beatriz is a vegetarian,
so if we could just put


531
00:31:13.335 --> 00:31:16.236
some vegetables and rice
and salad on her plate,


532
00:31:16.238 --> 00:31:17.471
that'd be great.
Thank you.


533
00:31:17.473 --> 00:31:18.872
Thank you, Kathy.
That's perfect.


534
00:31:18.874 --> 00:31:20.874
Rolfing, huh?
You go to school for that?


535
00:31:20.876 --> 00:31:24.744
Well, when I first came to the
United States a long time ago...


536
00:31:24.746 --> 00:31:26.680
Did you come legally?

537
00:31:26.682 --> 00:31:28.782
- Yes.
- How'd that work?


538
00:31:28.784 --> 00:31:31.451
I had family here
on my mother's side.


539
00:31:31.453 --> 00:31:34.855
- When my grandmother died...
- And they're all citizens or...


540
00:31:34.857 --> 00:31:37.157
God, Doug, what...
You work for the ins?


541
00:31:37.159 --> 00:31:39.559
- You're grilling her.
- I'm curious.


542
00:31:39.561 --> 00:31:40.794
A lot of people
come here illegally.


543
00:31:40.796 --> 00:31:42.562
I was interested how she did it.

544
00:31:42.564 --> 00:31:44.164
Okay. Just ignore him.

545
00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:46.900
So you came here however,
who cares, and then?


546
00:31:46.902 --> 00:31:50.137
I found a job
at a health food market.


547
00:31:50.139 --> 00:31:51.905
I didn't speak any English,

548
00:31:51.907 --> 00:31:53.840
so my job was just to clean

549
00:31:53.842 --> 00:31:56.143
and lay out the fresh food.

550
00:31:56.145 --> 00:31:59.846
But there was a pharmacist
there, Dr. Shibari.


551
00:31:59.848 --> 00:32:01.581
And he taught me everything

552
00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:04.751
about alternative medicine,
all the therapies.


553
00:32:04.753 --> 00:32:06.286
He was like a father to me,

554
00:32:06.288 --> 00:32:07.654
the father I wish I had.

555
00:32:07.656 --> 00:32:09.456
So great to have a mentor.

556
00:32:09.458 --> 00:32:11.758
Dr. Shibari was
a wonderful man.


557
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.493
Very wise.

558
00:32:13.495 --> 00:32:15.729
He saved my life, I think,

559
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:17.664
because I always had inside me

560
00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:19.499
the desire to be a healer...

561
00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:22.469
Good for you. You're working.
You're contributing.


562
00:32:22.471 --> 00:32:23.737
Must be very fulfilling.

563
00:32:23.739 --> 00:32:25.772
Uh, just wanted to mention...

564
00:32:25.774 --> 00:32:27.207
From the time I was very little,

565
00:32:27.209 --> 00:32:29.643
I have these feelings.

566
00:32:29.645 --> 00:32:32.779
I remember
I was maybe six years old.


567
00:32:32.781 --> 00:32:34.481
My father was a fisherman,

568
00:32:34.483 --> 00:32:36.650
and he took me
to the sea to fish.


569
00:32:36.652 --> 00:32:39.252
We were on this
little pier, you know,


570
00:32:39.254 --> 00:32:41.755
and he pulled up

571
00:32:41.757 --> 00:32:42.822
an octopus,

572
00:32:42.824 --> 00:32:45.425
a big, beautiful white,

573
00:32:45.427 --> 00:32:47.594
very white octopus.

574
00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:50.830
I had never seen
anything like that.


575
00:32:50.832 --> 00:32:52.599
And my father

576
00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:55.335
starts kicking the octopus.

577
00:32:55.337 --> 00:32:59.406
He kicked it down that pier
like if it was a football.


578
00:32:59.408 --> 00:33:02.576
He was stomping on it
like a crazy man.


579
00:33:02.578 --> 00:33:05.445
And then he starts
kicking it towards me.


580
00:33:05.447 --> 00:33:09.950
Then he said to me,
"Beatriz, kill it."


581
00:33:09.952 --> 00:33:12.652
I looked down at the octopus

582
00:33:12.654 --> 00:33:14.588
and I touched it.

583
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.389
And this shock

584
00:33:16.391 --> 00:33:19.960
went through my whole body.

585
00:33:19.962 --> 00:33:23.396
I could feel the pain of
this octopus.


586
00:33:23.398 --> 00:33:25.265
It was electric.

587
00:33:25.267 --> 00:33:27.567
- You're very sensitive.
- Maybe it was an electric eel.


588
00:33:27.569 --> 00:33:30.570
When I'm on the table, she can sense
exactly where I'm storing my stress.


589
00:33:30.572 --> 00:33:32.739
- It's usually in my...
- Have you ever seen a white octopus?


590
00:33:32.741 --> 00:33:35.642
- I store mine there too, but I walk like...
- Yes, terrifying.


591
00:33:35.644 --> 00:33:37.344
He forced me to go scuba diving.

592
00:33:37.346 --> 00:33:39.512
I was fucking out of there.
I had a panic attack.


593
00:33:39.514 --> 00:33:41.615
- Fuses to the bone.
- Really? That sucks.


594
00:33:41.617 --> 00:33:43.483
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
- This looks great.


595
00:33:43.485 --> 00:33:44.851
Oh, my god.
I'm so excited.


596
00:33:44.853 --> 00:33:46.553
For those of you with the beef,

597
00:33:46.555 --> 00:33:48.822
it's a tenderloin
with a garlic horseradish cream,


598
00:33:48.824 --> 00:33:50.857
and the fish is
a grilled Alaskan Halibut


599
00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:52.592
with a lemon-dill vinaigrette.

600
00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:54.427
- Thank you, Evan.
- Mm! So tasty.


601
00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:56.730
So just a heads up,
got word at the end of the day


602
00:33:56.732 --> 00:33:59.599
that the NRDC's gonna be filing
a suit against the bill.


603
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:02.002
Of course they are.
Fuck them. That's why we need


604
00:34:02.004 --> 00:34:05.338
to break ground immediately.
Just get going Monday morning.


605
00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.040
We're on it, Doug.
We're on the same page.


606
00:34:07.042 --> 00:34:10.577
Because until a judge
issues an injunction,


607
00:34:10.579 --> 00:34:12.646
it is completely
within our rights


608
00:34:12.648 --> 00:34:14.281
to start clearing the land.

609
00:34:14.283 --> 00:34:15.482
For sure.
It's just they found


610
00:34:15.484 --> 00:34:17.017
some nests of
a few protected birds.


611
00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:18.485
- Move them.
- That's what we'll have to do.


612
00:34:18.487 --> 00:34:19.786
Exactly.
And obviously, you know,


613
00:34:19.788 --> 00:34:21.521
there's still a lot
of permitting


614
00:34:21.523 --> 00:34:22.822
'cause the county
and the state are dragging...


615
00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.791
The permitting is
for the construction, okay?


616
00:34:24.793 --> 00:34:26.293
We can still clear the land.

617
00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:27.661
Right, yes, true.

618
00:34:27.663 --> 00:34:29.729
And if we wait to clear,
there could be hiccups.


619
00:34:29.731 --> 00:34:31.398
I've been down this road before.

620
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.699
Once you've cleared the land,

621
00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:34.534
there's nothing left to protect.

622
00:34:34.536 --> 00:34:35.769
There's nothing to protest.

623
00:34:35.771 --> 00:34:37.404
There's nothing to fight about.

624
00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:38.872
Hundred percent.
I agree.


625
00:34:38.874 --> 00:34:40.573
Jackie in my office
also did mention


626
00:34:40.575 --> 00:34:42.475
there's talk online
of a few activists,


627
00:34:42.477 --> 00:34:44.611
super marginal players,
who, you know,


628
00:34:44.613 --> 00:34:46.846
may be handcuffing
themselves to the fences


629
00:34:46.848 --> 00:34:48.882
- outside the work site.
- I've had worse.


630
00:34:48.884 --> 00:34:51.384
- So have we.
- Once, we built a hotel


631
00:34:51.386 --> 00:34:53.586
in Panama,
and some locals blew up


632
00:34:53.588 --> 00:34:55.555
one of our trucks
with a fucking bomb.


633
00:34:55.557 --> 00:34:58.024
So, you know, bring it on.

634
00:34:58.026 --> 00:35:01.094
The most important thing
is to start.


635
00:35:01.096 --> 00:35:02.595
We start.

636
00:35:02.597 --> 00:35:04.464
And once we start,
we have the momentum.


637
00:35:04.466 --> 00:35:05.865
This is why I love
working with you.


638
00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:07.534
No canvassing.
Usually there are


639
00:35:07.536 --> 00:35:09.469
so many meetings
and hand-wringing.


640
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:11.771
Benefit of a privately owned
company, pal.


641
00:35:11.773 --> 00:35:13.373
It's the history of progress.

642
00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:14.941
- One man's will.
- What is this man's name?


643
00:35:14.943 --> 00:35:16.376
- Doug.
- Doug what?


644
00:35:16.378 --> 00:35:18.044
- It's me and my will.
- Strutt.


645
00:35:18.046 --> 00:35:20.914
- How do you spell it?
- Hmm?


646
00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:23.383
Shannon could really use you
on one of her projects.


647
00:35:23.385 --> 00:35:25.085
That's right.
I'm project director


648
00:35:25.087 --> 00:35:26.853
on a refinery
we're building in France.


649
00:35:26.855 --> 00:35:28.488
I mean, talk about bureaucracy.

650
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.689
- Excuse me.
- France is like a third-world country.


651
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:31.391
You can't get
anything done there.


652
00:35:31.393 --> 00:35:33.126
I hate France, hate the French.

653
00:36:09.864 --> 00:36:10.930
Bye.

654
00:36:15.936 --> 00:36:19.072
The wife, mother-in-law,
two aunts, one of them lived


655
00:36:19.074 --> 00:36:21.674
even though the bullet went in
her skull and came out her jaw.


656
00:36:21.676 --> 00:36:23.143
This was three blocks
from our house.


657
00:36:23.145 --> 00:36:24.711
Yeah, we used to see
them at Starbucks.


658
00:36:24.713 --> 00:36:26.079
I mean, what is going on?

659
00:36:26.081 --> 00:36:28.648
- People are fucking nuts.
- People are insane.


660
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.751
So, Doug, you build hotels?

661
00:36:31.753 --> 00:36:32.952
Yeah, I don't build them, no.

662
00:36:32.954 --> 00:36:35.688
He builds things.
I just own them.


663
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.625
You own hotels?

664
00:36:38.627 --> 00:36:41.828
Have you ever owned
any in Mexico?


665
00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.062
Yeah, a few.

666
00:36:43.064 --> 00:36:46.533
Did you have one
in Tlaltecuhtli?


667
00:36:46.535 --> 00:36:48.768
- Tlalte... what?
- Tlaltecuhtli.


668
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:52.806
- Tlaltecuhtli.
- Tlaltecuhtli.


669
00:36:52.808 --> 00:36:54.707
I don't know. I don't
even know where that is.


670
00:36:54.709 --> 00:36:57.177
In Guerrero, north of Acapulco.

671
00:36:57.179 --> 00:36:59.679
I partner on a hotel in Cancun

672
00:36:59.681 --> 00:37:01.047
and one in San Miguel.

673
00:37:01.049 --> 00:37:02.982
This was a resort
with a golf course.


674
00:37:02.984 --> 00:37:05.218
It closed.
It was only open for a year.


675
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.587
Mine don't close.
Mostly.


676
00:37:10.792 --> 00:37:13.193
Oh, this tenderloin was amazing.

677
00:37:13.195 --> 00:37:15.161
So is the fish.
So buttery. Flaky.


678
00:37:15.163 --> 00:37:16.663
I'm so glad.

679
00:37:16.665 --> 00:37:19.065
This hotel destroyed
my whole town.


680
00:37:19.067 --> 00:37:21.568
The Mexican government
told the people


681
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.470
that they were gonna
have many jobs


682
00:37:23.472 --> 00:37:26.573
at the hotel,
that there would be work.


683
00:37:26.575 --> 00:37:29.876
They were very excited at first,

684
00:37:29.878 --> 00:37:33.146
but then they took
their land illegally.


685
00:37:33.148 --> 00:37:35.949
All these people
had to leave their homes


686
00:37:35.951 --> 00:37:39.085
with nothing and nowhere to go.

687
00:37:39.087 --> 00:37:40.520
My family too.

688
00:37:40.522 --> 00:37:42.689
- Oh, no.
- There were protests.


689
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:45.124
A lot of people were killed
by the Mexican police.


690
00:37:45.126 --> 00:37:47.527
Assassinated. It's a fact.

691
00:37:47.529 --> 00:37:48.728
Shit. Jesus.

692
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:50.163
They dug up all the canals,

693
00:37:50.165 --> 00:37:52.565
cut away the mangrove trees.

694
00:37:52.567 --> 00:37:54.534
It was an American hotel.

695
00:37:54.536 --> 00:37:56.703
I can't remember the name.

696
00:37:56.705 --> 00:37:59.138
- Hyatt? Hilton? Sheridan?
- It was 40 years ago.


697
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.975
- Four seasons?
- I'm old, sweetheart. I'm not that old.


698
00:38:01.977 --> 00:38:03.209
When I first saw you,

699
00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:05.144
I thought I knew
you from somewhere.


700
00:38:05.146 --> 00:38:08.147
And then you started speaking about
people protesting your hotel.


701
00:38:08.149 --> 00:38:10.884
It's not a hotel.
It's a shopping center.


702
00:38:10.886 --> 00:38:12.752
And no one's getting kicked out

703
00:38:12.754 --> 00:38:15.788
of their homes
except maybe a few birds.


704
00:38:16.991 --> 00:38:18.591
Honey, why don't we eat
our dessert


705
00:38:18.593 --> 00:38:20.527
- in the living room?
- Yes. Great.


706
00:38:20.529 --> 00:38:21.761
Let's all stretch our legs.

707
00:38:32.973 --> 00:38:35.074
Doug, I'm sorry if I...

708
00:38:36.744 --> 00:38:39.078
Just know that I'm happy
for your project.


709
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.016
- Thanks, hon.
- No, really.


710
00:38:44.318 --> 00:38:45.652
You're warm.

711
00:38:48.022 --> 00:38:49.122
Oh!

712
00:38:50.124 --> 00:38:51.190
Wow.

713
00:38:51.192 --> 00:38:53.293
Hey, this is my lucky day.

714
00:38:53.295 --> 00:38:54.994
Oh, your neck,

715
00:38:54.996 --> 00:38:57.263
there's a lot of tension
on your neck.


716
00:38:57.265 --> 00:38:59.966
She's a miracle worker, Doug.

717
00:39:40.641 --> 00:39:41.708
Oh...

718
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.777
That was great.

719
00:39:44.779 --> 00:39:45.779
Thank...

720
00:39:48.682 --> 00:39:50.817
Chocolate and raspberry,
the absolute best.


721
00:39:50.819 --> 00:39:52.619
- It's so creamy.
- Isn't it?


722
00:39:52.621 --> 00:39:54.354
Beatriz, I think
we have some sorbet.


723
00:39:54.356 --> 00:39:56.756
Can you check to see if we have
some sorbet for Beatriz?


724
00:39:56.758 --> 00:39:58.658
I think we have
a pineapple or a mango.


725
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.026
Absolutely.

726
00:40:00.028 --> 00:40:02.261
- How are your sons, Doug?
- Oh, they're great.


727
00:40:02.263 --> 00:40:03.896
Jack has his fun.

728
00:40:03.898 --> 00:40:06.032
He's just raking it in,
hand over fist.


729
00:40:06.034 --> 00:40:07.834
He's gonna be richer
than all of us.


730
00:40:07.836 --> 00:40:09.402
I got to say,
I get almost jealous


731
00:40:09.404 --> 00:40:12.105
when I see how easy it is
for these guys from banking


732
00:40:12.107 --> 00:40:15.808
to just pull these pots
of gold out of thin air.


733
00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:16.909
I know. It's sick, right?

734
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:19.846
For me, way more satisfying,

735
00:40:19.848 --> 00:40:21.280
what I do.

736
00:40:21.282 --> 00:40:23.783
Yeah, it's not always easy.

737
00:40:23.785 --> 00:40:26.185
- Every step is a slog.
- The struggle is real.


738
00:40:26.187 --> 00:40:29.255
But you're building something.
It's not all transactional.


739
00:40:29.257 --> 00:40:32.659
You're changing the dynamics
of things, real things.


740
00:40:32.661 --> 00:40:34.827
You get a vision
of a place in your head,


741
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:36.729
and then, poof, it exists.

742
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:39.032
- You're writing history.
- Totally agree.


743
00:40:39.034 --> 00:40:42.268
And Calvin's working with me
at rife, and he's a natural.


744
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.437
We got exactly
the same instincts.


745
00:40:44.439 --> 00:40:46.005
That's so neat, Doug.

746
00:40:46.007 --> 00:40:48.941
And when I hang it up,
whenever that day comes,


747
00:40:48.943 --> 00:40:51.110
I have no doubt that he will
carry on the dynasty.


748
00:40:51.112 --> 00:40:53.780
I don't see you handing over
the reins any time soon.


749
00:40:53.782 --> 00:40:55.682
Out of my cold,
dead hands, right?


750
00:40:57.686 --> 00:40:59.852
And they both have
families and grandkids.


751
00:40:59.854 --> 00:41:01.287
Everyone gets along with Jeana.

752
00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:03.056
- I mean, mostly.
- Uh-oh.


753
00:41:03.058 --> 00:41:04.424
No, we do. The big issue

754
00:41:04.426 --> 00:41:06.259
is where we're gonna
spend the holidays.


755
00:41:06.261 --> 00:41:07.894
Jack and Britney
are in Connecticut,


756
00:41:07.896 --> 00:41:09.729
and they have their house
in St. Barth's.


757
00:41:09.731 --> 00:41:12.298
And Calvin's here, and he
has his place in Cabo,


758
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.701
and we're here and we
have this place we love


759
00:41:14.703 --> 00:41:16.269
- on the big island.
- War of the beach houses.


760
00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:19.205
- Yeah, we always lose.
- Jack's wife is not easy.


761
00:41:19.207 --> 00:41:22.108
We try to go away every summer.
It's just so hot now everywhere.


762
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.110
- And crowded. Ugh.
- The best weather's right here.


763
00:41:24.112 --> 00:41:26.179
That's what I keep saying
to Kathy. Why leave?


764
00:41:26.181 --> 00:41:28.314
Actually, we're going to South
Africa in a couple of days.


765
00:41:28.316 --> 00:41:30.950
- It's gonna be 115 degrees.
- Oh, what's happening there?


766
00:41:30.952 --> 00:41:32.385
- South Africa?
- For a safari.


767
00:41:32.387 --> 00:41:34.087
- Oh, amazing.
- Oh, cool.


768
00:41:34.089 --> 00:41:35.788
- I wanna go.
- You should come.


769
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:36.923
No, seriously, come.

770
00:41:36.925 --> 00:41:38.458
I'm gonna be by myself all day

771
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.460
stuck at the lodge
with little kids and Britney.


772
00:41:40.462 --> 00:41:42.462
- Unfortunately, I work.
- Where's Doug gonna be?


773
00:41:42.464 --> 00:41:44.864
Oh, he'll be gone all day
with Jack and Calvin hunting.


774
00:41:44.866 --> 00:41:47.233
- Hunting? Shit.
- Yeah. It's Africa, right?


775
00:41:47.235 --> 00:41:49.235
- What are you hunting?
- -Oh, don't go into it.


776
00:41:49.237 --> 00:41:51.104
- You brought it up.
- Okay.


777
00:41:51.106 --> 00:41:52.905
Well, it's true
what they say, those animals


778
00:41:52.907 --> 00:41:54.507
would basically be gone
if it wasn't for the hunting


779
00:41:54.509 --> 00:41:56.275
because it's very important
to the economy.


780
00:41:56.277 --> 00:41:57.810
It keeps the parks going.

781
00:41:57.812 --> 00:42:01.848
I have had all the rushes
there are, every one.


782
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.449
I've been to the buffet of life.

783
00:42:03.451 --> 00:42:06.119
I've tasted everything
and I'm telling you,


784
00:42:06.121 --> 00:42:09.021
being in Africa, okay?

785
00:42:09.023 --> 00:42:11.858
Where all the species
originated,


786
00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.893
everyone, including us.

787
00:42:13.895 --> 00:42:16.295
Going out into the wild

788
00:42:16.297 --> 00:42:17.830
when it's still dark

789
00:42:17.832 --> 00:42:20.967
and it's quiet except
for these strange,


790
00:42:20.969 --> 00:42:23.136
prehistoric sounds,

791
00:42:23.138 --> 00:42:26.839
and waiting for some beast

792
00:42:26.841 --> 00:42:29.475
to emerge out of the bush.

793
00:42:29.477 --> 00:42:31.110
There's no bigger rush.

794
00:42:31.112 --> 00:42:32.545
Hmm. I bet.

795
00:42:32.547 --> 00:42:35.915
There's no better high, not...
Not sex, not drugs,


796
00:42:35.917 --> 00:42:37.316
not money,

797
00:42:37.318 --> 00:42:40.386
and facing that creature down,

798
00:42:40.388 --> 00:42:43.823
and looking in its eyes

799
00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:45.124
and taking it.

800
00:42:47.027 --> 00:42:49.428
I don't consider it murder.

801
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.863
I don't.

802
00:42:50.865 --> 00:42:52.899
It is a killing, obviously,

803
00:42:52.901 --> 00:42:55.334
but it's just this deep,

804
00:42:55.336 --> 00:42:58.938
primal thing.

805
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.540
It's like this original dance

806
00:43:00.542 --> 00:43:04.010
of man and beast,
man and nature,


807
00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:05.845
the struggle for survival.

808
00:43:05.847 --> 00:43:08.581
It's very pure.

809
00:43:08.583 --> 00:43:10.316
Hmm.

810
00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:12.819
Not to get too airy-fairy.

811
00:43:14.389 --> 00:43:17.857
Yeah. I just can't
imagine doing it myself.


812
00:43:17.859 --> 00:43:19.425
What kind of beast?

813
00:43:19.427 --> 00:43:21.894
- Huh?
- What... what are you hunting this time?


814
00:43:21.896 --> 00:43:25.264
- Let's just say big game.
- Well, come on, tell us.


815
00:43:25.266 --> 00:43:27.333
No. Let's not get into it.
Some people can't handle it.


816
00:43:27.335 --> 00:43:29.936
Let me just show you a picture
from our last trip.


817
00:43:29.938 --> 00:43:33.472
- Oh, god.
- Hang on. Hang on. Where is it here?


818
00:43:33.474 --> 00:43:35.408
Here. There you go.

819
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:40.379
Wow. You shot that?

820
00:43:40.381 --> 00:43:43.115
Holy fuck.
That thing is massive.


821
00:43:43.117 --> 00:43:46.018
Yeah. Maybe ten yards
from me, too.


822
00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.286
Don't look at that, Kathy.

823
00:43:47.288 --> 00:43:48.287
I'm not going to.

824
00:43:48.289 --> 00:43:49.422
Oh, my god.

825
00:43:49.424 --> 00:43:51.157
Cost me a fortune for that one.

826
00:43:51.159 --> 00:43:52.892
Almost didn't get it, either.

827
00:43:52.894 --> 00:43:55.895
Yeah. We knew
it was out there,


828
00:43:55.897 --> 00:43:58.531
but it took us
about ten hours to find it.


829
00:43:58.533 --> 00:44:02.134
Hunting is all about Patience.

830
00:44:02.136 --> 00:44:05.304
We had to stalk it for, like,

831
00:44:05.306 --> 00:44:08.174
all day, and suddenly,

832
00:44:08.176 --> 00:44:11.644
out of nowhere, we came on it.

833
00:44:11.646 --> 00:44:15.014
<i>Jack spotted it in a clearing.</i>

834
00:44:15.016 --> 00:44:19.018
<i>Now those rhinos can run,
trust me.</i>


835
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.988
<i>They can move,
and they're dangerous.</i>


836
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:24.390
Not as dangerous as hippos.
We got one of them, too.


837
00:44:24.392 --> 00:44:26.425
We did find some sorbet.

838
00:44:26.427 --> 00:44:28.394
Mix here of pineapple,
passion fruit, and guava.


839
00:44:28.396 --> 00:44:31.097
Are you for real?

840
00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:33.399
This is disgusting.

841
00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:36.335
You... you killed this thing?

842
00:44:36.337 --> 00:44:37.970
Hey, hey, what?

843
00:44:37.972 --> 00:44:39.338
What is wrong with you?

844
00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.406
Beatriz, calm down.

845
00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:43.209
You think it's funny?

846
00:44:43.211 --> 00:44:44.944
I don't think it's funny.

847
00:44:44.946 --> 00:44:47.346
I think it's fucking sick.

848
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.184
I told you. Most people
can't handle it.


849
00:44:52.186 --> 00:44:54.420
- Doug, I'm... I'm so sorry, man.
- I'm so sorry.


850
00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:57.657
She's had a really hard week.
I don't know what to say.


851
00:44:57.659 --> 00:44:59.525
It's fine.
Not everyone is like me.


852
00:44:59.527 --> 00:45:01.360
And thank god, right?

853
00:45:01.362 --> 00:45:03.529
I'm just glad
she didn't break my phone.


854
00:45:03.531 --> 00:45:06.098
- Is it broken?
- It does have a little crack, actually.


855
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.201
Oh, well, we will replace
that, Doug, please.


856
00:45:09.203 --> 00:45:11.170
- Absolutely.
- It's fine.


857
00:45:11.172 --> 00:45:14.206
Does she get out much?

858
00:45:20.314 --> 00:45:21.547
Where is she?

859
00:45:22.716 --> 00:45:24.717
- Should I offer coffee?
- No. Not yet.


860
00:45:24.719 --> 00:45:27.019
Let them keep drinking.

861
00:45:32.092 --> 00:45:33.659
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry, Kathy.


862
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:35.962
- Yeah. I don't...
- I saw it and I don't know,


863
00:45:35.964 --> 00:45:38.130
- I just flipped out.
- I get it. I just...


864
00:45:38.132 --> 00:45:40.666
You were so nice to let me stay.

865
00:45:40.668 --> 00:45:43.469
I never drink. I think
I had three glasses.


866
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:46.138
I've just been very emotional.

867
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.573
I think you're just burned out.

868
00:45:47.575 --> 00:45:49.141
That's what it is.

869
00:45:49.143 --> 00:45:51.143
You're burned out.
It's hard what you do.


870
00:45:51.145 --> 00:45:53.012
One of my patients,
he's only 16.


871
00:45:53.014 --> 00:45:55.548
He's gonna die, Kathy,
and there's nothing I can do.


872
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:57.984
It's horrible.
And then Jeronimo.


873
00:45:57.986 --> 00:46:00.586
I know. Aw.

874
00:46:00.588 --> 00:46:02.989
I'm so embarrassed.

875
00:46:02.991 --> 00:46:04.757
Do you think I should
go say something?


876
00:46:04.759 --> 00:46:08.094
I think maybe, honestly,
you should just go to bed.


877
00:46:08.096 --> 00:46:09.762
Just go to Tara's room, okay?

878
00:46:09.764 --> 00:46:11.998
It's fine.
It didn't bother him.


879
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.232
He's a tough guy.

880
00:46:13.234 --> 00:46:16.235
That beautiful rhinoceros,
Kathy. Why?


881
00:46:16.237 --> 00:46:17.470
Don't think about it.

882
00:46:17.472 --> 00:46:19.505
I'm so sorry
I ruined your party.


883
00:46:19.507 --> 00:46:21.474
I will take you
and Grant for dinner.


884
00:46:21.476 --> 00:46:23.042
- No.
- I'll cook.


885
00:46:23.044 --> 00:46:25.011
- No. Don't worry about it.
- Free treatments.


886
00:46:25.013 --> 00:46:27.346
Please, just let me give you free
treatments for the rest of your life.


887
00:46:27.348 --> 00:46:28.547
I have to get back
to the group, though.


888
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:30.016
Yes, of course.

889
00:46:30.018 --> 00:46:31.283
Go up to Tara's room.

890
00:46:31.285 --> 00:46:32.718
Go to bed. I'll see
you in the morning.


891
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.487
- Thank you for everything.
- Okay.


892
00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:37.656
I never should drink like that.

893
00:46:37.658 --> 00:46:40.693
- I love you, Kathy.
- Aw. Good night.


894
00:52:19.566 --> 00:52:20.966
<i>Aw.</i>

895
00:52:20.968 --> 00:52:23.102
But I think what you're
saying is true, Doug.


896
00:52:23.104 --> 00:52:25.537
You don't really know people when
they work for you. You don't.


897
00:52:25.539 --> 00:52:27.439
Well, of course. I mean,
everybody kisses your ass.


898
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:28.574
Everyone's nice to the boss.

899
00:52:28.576 --> 00:52:30.409
I actually think
you only know people


900
00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:31.877
when they<i>do</i> work for you.

901
00:52:31.879 --> 00:52:33.812
That's when you see their ego,

902
00:52:33.814 --> 00:52:37.716
needs, insecurities,
authority issues.


903
00:52:37.718 --> 00:52:40.119
- Yes, preach, totally.
- It's... it's...


904
00:52:40.121 --> 00:52:41.920
<i>Buena noches.</i>

905
00:52:44.057 --> 00:52:45.891
I thought you went to bed.

906
00:52:45.893 --> 00:52:50.562
I remember, Kathy, you asked me
to sing a song after dinner.


907
00:52:50.564 --> 00:52:54.600
Oh, yeah, but that's
not necessary now, Beatriz.


908
00:52:54.602 --> 00:52:56.635
I feel I should.

909
00:52:56.637 --> 00:52:59.104
Well, we're just
enjoying the stars


910
00:52:59.106 --> 00:53:01.673
and the sounds
of the night, so...


911
00:53:01.675 --> 00:53:03.709
I feel bad about
what happened earlier.


912
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:05.444
I lost my manners.
I'm sorry.


913
00:53:05.446 --> 00:53:07.413
It happens.
Don't tear your hair out.


914
00:53:07.415 --> 00:53:09.481
Oh, god, Doug loses
his manners all the time.


915
00:53:09.483 --> 00:53:10.783
Don't give it two thoughts.

916
00:53:10.785 --> 00:53:13.152
Every time I go out with him
he embarrasses me.


917
00:53:13.154 --> 00:53:14.953
Well, you're well compensated.

918
00:53:14.955 --> 00:53:16.455
See? He's rude.

919
00:53:16.457 --> 00:53:17.489
He can't help it.

920
00:53:18.825 --> 00:53:21.093
Do you know "Las simples cosas"?

921
00:53:21.095 --> 00:53:24.163
This song talks about
how we always wanna go back


922
00:53:24.165 --> 00:53:26.732
to the places
where we loved life,


923
00:53:26.734 --> 00:53:29.668
but the old, simple things
are now gone.


924
00:55:29.188 --> 00:55:30.856
That was very nice.

925
00:55:30.858 --> 00:55:32.824
- Very nice.
- Oh, that was lovely.


926
00:55:32.826 --> 00:55:33.959
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

927
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:35.861
<i>- De Nada.
- Ay, chihuahua.</i>


928
00:55:35.863 --> 00:55:37.596
Okay, you're...
You're done.


929
00:55:37.598 --> 00:55:39.598
- Sorry.
- Thank you very much.


930
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.134
Oh, it is so nice out here.

931
00:55:42.136 --> 00:55:43.669
Oh, we feel so lucky.

932
00:55:43.671 --> 00:55:45.704
Except we bought
at the height of the market.


933
00:55:45.706 --> 00:55:47.039
Other than that, we feel lucky.

934
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:48.941
Well, you can't
take it with you.


935
00:55:48.943 --> 00:55:50.108
More wine?

936
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:51.677
Oh, yes, please.

937
00:55:55.148 --> 00:55:57.082
Doug, you really are famous.

938
00:55:59.118 --> 00:56:01.820
I was just searching you on the
Internet, and you're famous.


939
00:56:01.822 --> 00:56:03.722
Nah, famous?
I don't know, I'm known.


940
00:56:03.724 --> 00:56:05.023
You gave a great Ted talk, Doug.

941
00:56:05.025 --> 00:56:06.625
We watched that the other night.

942
00:56:06.627 --> 00:56:08.961
For a moment, I thought
you were a different man,


943
00:56:08.963 --> 00:56:12.130
the man that bought
the land in Tlaltecuhtli.


944
00:56:12.132 --> 00:56:16.335
For a minute,
I freaked out, you know?


945
00:56:16.337 --> 00:56:18.704
Really, because I have to say

946
00:56:18.706 --> 00:56:21.073
if you had been that man,

947
00:56:21.075 --> 00:56:23.742
I would've thought that fate
brought us together.


948
00:56:23.744 --> 00:56:26.278
- For what?
- I don't know.


949
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.280
Revenge, maybe?

950
00:56:28.282 --> 00:56:30.282
I should kill you or something?

951
00:56:33.354 --> 00:56:35.253
But you're not that man.

952
00:56:35.255 --> 00:56:36.688
You're another man.

953
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:38.657
Many men do what I do.

954
00:56:38.659 --> 00:56:40.726
One man, many men.

955
00:56:44.664 --> 00:56:46.698
So you believe in fate, huh?

956
00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.001
- Yes.
- So do I.


957
00:56:49.003 --> 00:56:54.673
I think we all have
a destiny to manifest.


958
00:56:54.675 --> 00:56:56.842
And if we don't,
it hurts the soul.


959
00:56:56.844 --> 00:56:59.111
If the brass ring is there,
there's a reason.


960
00:56:59.113 --> 00:57:00.879
And if we don't grab it, we...

961
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:02.414
We regret it for the rest
of our lives.


962
00:57:02.416 --> 00:57:03.915
- I think that's right.
- Word.


963
00:57:03.917 --> 00:57:07.119
I always felt that my fate
was to heal people.


964
00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:09.688
And that's what
I've tried to do.


965
00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:13.025
But there's so many sick people.

966
00:57:13.027 --> 00:57:14.926
Every day, more come.

967
00:57:14.928 --> 00:57:18.130
They have cancer,
they are dying.


968
00:57:18.132 --> 00:57:21.733
It's like a war,
and I'm just a nurse


969
00:57:21.735 --> 00:57:24.269
in the middle of a battlefield.

970
00:57:24.271 --> 00:57:27.406
It's too much.
I'm tired.


971
00:57:27.408 --> 00:57:30.342
But hasn't cancer
gotten more treatable?


972
00:57:30.344 --> 00:57:31.943
It has. Just look at Tara.

973
00:57:31.945 --> 00:57:33.879
A good time to have cancer.

974
00:57:35.449 --> 00:57:39.384
Doug, you think killing
is hard, huh?


975
00:57:39.386 --> 00:57:41.053
You wait in the bushes,

976
00:57:41.055 --> 00:57:43.855
the animal might outrun you
or charge you.


977
00:57:43.857 --> 00:57:46.158
It's not easy
to get your shot, hm?


978
00:57:48.194 --> 00:57:51.463
Try healing something.

979
00:57:51.465 --> 00:57:53.065
That is hard.

980
00:57:53.067 --> 00:57:55.801
That requires Patience.

981
00:57:55.803 --> 00:57:58.470
You can break something
in two seconds.


982
00:57:59.939 --> 00:58:02.874
But it can take forever
to fix it,


983
00:58:02.876 --> 00:58:05.877
a lifetime, generations.

984
00:58:05.879 --> 00:58:10.449
That's why we have to be careful
on this earth, and gentle.


985
00:58:10.451 --> 00:58:13.118
Sounds like you have
a pretty tough job.


986
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.855
Yes, and there are moments
where I think...


987
00:58:16.857 --> 00:58:19.458
Instead of trying to heal
all these people...


988
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.861
It'd be better just to find

989
00:58:22.863 --> 00:58:25.263
the source of all the suffering.

990
00:58:25.265 --> 00:58:27.099
Destroy the source, you know?

991
00:58:27.101 --> 00:58:28.266
What's the source?

992
00:58:31.904 --> 00:58:33.004
What, you think I'm the source?

993
00:58:33.006 --> 00:58:34.306
She doesn't think that.

994
00:58:34.308 --> 00:58:35.841
I think she does.

995
00:58:35.843 --> 00:58:37.743
You give me too much credit.

996
00:58:37.745 --> 00:58:41.780
What I think is all your pleasures
are built on other's pain.


997
00:58:41.782 --> 00:58:43.048
- Oh, that's bullshit.
- No.


998
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:45.350
Look, I'm a big boy, okay?

999
00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:51.423
Listen, honey, 
I think you have

1000
00:58:51.425 --> 00:58:54.926
a great depth of feeling
that you project onto the world.


1001
00:58:54.928 --> 00:58:58.196
But to be honest, the world
doesn't need your feelings.


1002
00:58:58.198 --> 00:59:00.999
It needs jobs, it needs money,
it needs what I do.


1003
00:59:01.001 --> 00:59:02.868
The world doesn't
need you. No.


1004
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:04.903
The world has
more than enough of it.


1005
00:59:04.905 --> 00:59:06.138
Doug is a great philanthropist.

1006
00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.172
Shut up, Kathy.

1007
00:59:07.174 --> 00:59:09.307
There is another type of cancer

1008
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:12.477
that is killing
this earth, Doug.


1009
00:59:12.479 --> 00:59:14.412
The world is dying.

1010
00:59:14.414 --> 00:59:16.047
You do see that.
Or are you blind?


1011
00:59:16.049 --> 00:59:17.949
The problem is there's
just too many people.


1012
00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:20.018
That's the problem, there's
just way too many people.


1013
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.254
You think that you can hide
up here behind this gate,


1014
00:59:22.256 --> 00:59:24.356
and that everything
is gonna be all right?


1015
00:59:24.358 --> 00:59:26.792
No, it's coming for you.

1016
00:59:26.794 --> 00:59:27.993
What the fuck is going on here?

1017
00:59:27.995 --> 00:59:29.027
- Okay, that's enough.
- Uh-hmm.


1018
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:30.195
It will touch you.

1019
00:59:30.197 --> 00:59:31.363
You're done.
Come on.


1020
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:40.405
I don't think she's a fan, Doug.

1021
00:59:40.407 --> 00:59:43.508
I hope it will touch me
in my private parts.


1022
00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.514
What the fuck
was that? Huh?


1023
00:59:49.516 --> 00:59:52.551
My relationship with that guy
paid for this house.


1024
00:59:52.553 --> 00:59:54.419
What were you thinking?

1025
00:59:54.421 --> 00:59:56.822
Why would you do that to Kathy?

1026
00:59:56.824 --> 00:59:59.357
She treats you
like her fucking friend.


1027
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:03.528
I'm calling a tow truck.

1028
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:05.497
They will tow you
back to Altadena.


1029
01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:07.365
You're going tonight.

1030
01:00:10.603 --> 01:00:13.104
Jesus.

1031
01:00:13.106 --> 01:00:16.308
Don't ruin it by being
a weird drunk, okay?


1032
01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:19.110
Stop it.

1033
01:00:19.112 --> 01:00:22.080
I mean, it's not like
we're beheading people


1034
01:00:22.082 --> 01:00:24.616
or blowing up babies,
it's so awkward.


1035
01:00:24.618 --> 01:00:27.619
Well, that was different.
I'm sorry about that, everyone.


1036
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:29.421
What happened?

1037
01:00:29.423 --> 01:00:31.389
- She's going home, don't worry about it.
- But how?


1038
01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:33.391
- I took care of it, okay?
- Okay.


1039
01:00:52.111 --> 01:00:54.045
<i>Bien, Muchas gracias.</i>

1040
01:01:32.184 --> 01:01:33.351
Beatriz?

1041
01:01:36.455 --> 01:01:38.056
You're leaving?

1042
01:01:38.058 --> 01:01:40.325
Yes.

1043
01:01:41.327 --> 01:01:43.028
I think it's best.

1044
01:01:44.463 --> 01:01:46.164
I wanted to give you some money.

1045
01:01:49.135 --> 01:01:51.303
Just take it.
It's gonna be so expensive


1046
01:01:51.305 --> 01:01:53.605
for you to get your car
towed back to Altadena.


1047
01:01:53.607 --> 01:01:55.073
I don't want your money.

1048
01:01:58.077 --> 01:02:00.278
Well, I don't know.

1049
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.647
I kind of feel like
I don't even know you.


1050
01:02:02.649 --> 01:02:05.417
You don't know me.

1051
01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:10.689
Well, I'm sorry this happened.

1052
01:02:14.994 --> 01:02:16.394
I'm gonna go back.

1053
01:02:30.409 --> 01:02:32.077
Well, where's the candle?

1054
01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:33.378
It's right here.

1055
01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.313
- That whole thing's a candle?
- Yeah. Yeah.


1056
01:02:35.315 --> 01:02:36.581
Now just let it get
a little hot.


1057
01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:38.149
I think you got
to light all the...


1058
01:02:38.151 --> 01:02:40.552
Oh, my god, Grant.
You know he's a pyromaniac.


1059
01:02:40.554 --> 01:02:41.987
Every time I turn around,

1060
01:02:41.989 --> 01:02:43.722
he's lighting something on fire.

1061
01:02:43.724 --> 01:02:46.057
- You wanna flip it?
- Yeah, let's flip it over.


1062
01:02:46.059 --> 01:02:47.258
Okay. Here we go.

1063
01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.027
- All right. Here we go.

1064
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:51.029
This is Cal.
He's got that deposition.


1065
01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:52.731
- I'm gonna take this in the house.
- Okay.


1066
01:02:52.733 --> 01:02:54.499
- Well, we just hold it?
- Yeah.


1067
01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:56.368
Jeana, would you like
to let it go?


1068
01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.237
Oh, okay. Hold that?

1069
01:02:59.239 --> 01:03:02.273
Now, make a wish because
it's a wishing lantern.


1070
01:03:02.275 --> 01:03:05.510
Okay. If I set everything on
fire, will it still come true?


1071
01:03:05.512 --> 01:03:07.412
Oh, I know.
Should we be doing this?


1072
01:03:07.414 --> 01:03:09.514
Yeah, technically,
it's not a firework.


1073
01:03:09.516 --> 01:03:12.450
Well, if you burn down the canyon,
you're still going to jail.


1074
01:03:12.452 --> 01:03:14.285
Alex is a lawyer.
He'll get you off.


1075
01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:16.087
Well, we would
have had so much fun.


1076
01:03:16.089 --> 01:03:17.789
I got you, man.
You're good.


1077
01:03:19.091 --> 01:03:20.558
Okay. All right.

1078
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.593
Let go.

1079
01:03:23.195 --> 01:03:24.262
Whee!

1080
01:03:24.264 --> 01:03:25.530
Whoa, oh!

1081
01:03:25.532 --> 01:03:27.298
See that?

1082
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.402
That is beautiful.

1083
01:03:30.404 --> 01:03:32.037
Isn't it amazing?

1084
01:03:32.039 --> 01:03:33.705
- Wow.
- -Look at that.


1085
01:04:09.075 --> 01:04:12.243
I think you should give
him all your emails to her.


1086
01:04:12.245 --> 01:04:15.380
Yeah all...
All your correspondence.


1087
01:04:15.382 --> 01:04:18.316
Yes, because she's
most likely gonna enter them


1088
01:04:18.318 --> 01:04:20.185
all as evidence anyway and...

1089
01:04:20.187 --> 01:04:21.853
And he needs to know
what he's up against.


1090
01:04:21.855 --> 01:04:23.755
He's your lawyer.
He's working for you.


1091
01:04:23.757 --> 01:04:26.224
You should have done this
eight months ago.


1092
01:04:26.226 --> 01:04:28.560
Okay. Okay.

1093
01:04:28.562 --> 01:04:30.728
Talk to him,
then just call me back.


1094
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:35.633
I'm... still at this dinner,
so make it fast.


1095
01:04:37.703 --> 01:04:39.504
Yeah... yeah. Bye.

1096
01:04:53.786 --> 01:04:55.286
No "good nights"?

1097
01:05:20.513 --> 01:05:23.515
How many years
until we're both dead?


1098
01:05:23.517 --> 01:05:25.717
Twenty years, thirty years?

1099
01:05:27.786 --> 01:05:30.155
We're dying.

1100
01:05:30.157 --> 01:05:31.356
Humans are dying.

1101
01:05:31.358 --> 01:05:32.624
The elephants are dying.

1102
01:05:32.626 --> 01:05:34.259
Bees are dying.

1103
01:05:34.261 --> 01:05:36.928
The world is dying.

1104
01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:38.796
What are you gonna do?

1105
01:05:38.798 --> 01:05:42.901
Accept it and enjoy yourself.

1106
01:05:42.903 --> 01:05:44.903
You should try
to enjoy yourself.


1107
01:05:46.372 --> 01:05:49.207
It's not all so sad, is it?

1108
01:05:53.646 --> 01:05:55.947
I know I know you.

1109
01:06:40.359 --> 01:06:41.993
You have everything?

1110
01:06:46.532 --> 01:06:47.765
You ready?

1111
01:07:19.832 --> 01:07:21.532
Wait.

1112
01:07:21.534 --> 01:07:23.401
I forgot one thing.

1113
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.328
Let's do it in the morning.
I got to get home.


1114
01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:55.600
I'm tired and I got...
Uhh! God.


1115
01:07:55.602 --> 01:07:57.835
Ohh, fuck!

1116
01:08:09.415 --> 01:08:12.417
All tears flow
from the same source.


1117
01:08:44.516 --> 01:08:46.451
What happened? Doug?

1118
01:08:46.453 --> 01:08:48.453
Doug? Doug?

1119
01:08:48.455 --> 01:08:49.754
- Oh, my god.
- Doug.


1120
01:08:49.756 --> 01:08:51.122
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

1121
01:08:51.124 --> 01:08:52.924
- What happened?
- Grant!


1122
01:08:52.926 --> 01:08:56.561
- Yeah.

1123
01:08:58.531 --> 01:09:01.499
- Beatriz, what happened?
- What did you do?


1124
01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:03.701
Oh, god!

1125
01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:06.104
No!

1126
01:09:06.106 --> 01:09:08.806
Why? Why?

1127
01:09:08.808 --> 01:09:11.075
- Beatriz, what happened?
- What did you do?


1128
01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.961
Well, let's do it
in the morning.


1129
01:09:29.963 --> 01:09:31.929
I'm tired and I got
other shit going on.


1130
01:10:27.119 --> 01:10:28.820
You okay?

1131
01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:35.860
That man killed my goat.

1132
01:10:58.817 --> 01:11:00.218
Pull over.

1133
01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.786
What?

1134
01:11:01.788 --> 01:11:04.822
Pull over, please, right there.

1135
01:11:46.131 --> 01:11:47.832
Where are you going?

1136
01:11:51.537 --> 01:11:52.637
Lady?

1137
01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.594
Can someone help me hold this?

1138
01:12:16.596 --> 01:12:17.962
Let them go at the same time.
Make a wish.


1139
01:12:17.964 --> 01:12:19.297
Everybody on three, one...

1140
01:12:19.299 --> 01:12:21.065
- Alex?
- What?


1141
01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:23.000
We're supposed to let
them go at the same time.


1142
01:12:23.002 --> 01:12:24.201
Sorry.
