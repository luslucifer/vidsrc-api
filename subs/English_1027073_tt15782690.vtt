1
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.770
Here they come.

2
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.620
Let's go now boys.

3
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.440
Oh. Fucking kids.

4
00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:05.140
Don't bother it, Patrick.

5
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.180
Oh, that's all we need.

6
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.380
That's it!

7
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.356
Why you did something like that

8
00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:14.396
Pick that up

9
00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:16.700
Apologize to your brother

10
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.571
We don't have time for this

11
00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:20.940
We already late

12
00:02:21.838 --> 00:02:23.139
Fuckin' come on

13
00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:26.146
Just leave it

14
00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:30.220
Fuckin' move it!

15
00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:41.214
Get in the car

16
00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:42.866
Fuckin' drive

17
00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.038
Go Go Go

18
00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:07.872
You're devious as shite, Finbar

19
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:09.301
What, Vinnie?

20
00:04:09.428 --> 00:04:11.192
I can see what you're up to, right?

21
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.440
How can I bloody blast them
if I can't freakin' see them?


22
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.320
Move them back up to
the top of the roof there.


23
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600
The wind, I can't hear.

24
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.861
All right, sure.

25
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.201
If you're implying that I'm
cheating, guard O'Shea.


26
00:04:27.973 --> 00:04:28.973
I'll take it very thick.

27
00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.611
Well, there's a wager. 
It has to be fair.

28
00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:33.908
Are you gonna whine about fairness all day?

29
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.801
Or are you gonna
take your shot and lose?

30
00:04:36.062 --> 00:04:37.062
Like you always do.

31
00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:38.814
Fuck you, hole

32
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.202
Come on with you

33
00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:41.932
See you little bastard.

34
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520
Thank you.

35
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.633
Robing me blindly, you whore.

36
00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:52.328
So what is the day, premise?

37
00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.888
Apart from feeding
your cat and pondering


38
00:04:55.913 --> 00:04:57.850
human reason with
Gulliver and the little folk?


39
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.691
I've finished Gulliver's Travels

40
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.210
I'm on to Mr. Dostoyevsky now.

41
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.550
Russian writer

42
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.230
He is not known to them

43
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.001
I think Christie's gonna
make a cup of tea.

44
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.710
Where are we going?

45
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.379
Oh, on a bit of official business.

46
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.989
Mrs. Bailey come up to
me and said the


47
00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:20.310
welcome sign on the town,
out this way has gone missing


48
00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:23.973
- Oh...
Now you'll see what real work entails.


49
00:05:33.462 --> 00:05:35.140
God, that's a bit of a mess.

50
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:44.770
Maroon.

51
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.330
Burgundy.

52
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.730
Burgundy.

53
00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:48.947
Burgundy.

54
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.921
Someone mad in car back

55
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.741
must have lost control of the car.

56
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.230
Or drunk.

57
00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:56.255
Aye

58
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.969
Probably thick in the head.

59
00:05:59.884 --> 00:06:02.446
See, you'll be looking for
some mental chase in town now.


60
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.530
Aye

61
00:06:04.637 --> 00:06:07.487
Should nail 'm by tea time, so...

62
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.595
I can feel your eyes
on the back of my head.


63
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.580
Rita

64
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.704
I have no doubt.

65
00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:25.376
Adam would have traded his Eve for you.

66
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.400
Have you sown this place?

67
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.134
Well, it's best to have a Hobby.

68
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.602
Oh, this will brighten up a home.

69
00:07:34.324 --> 00:07:35.324
For the table setting.

70
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.881
Which you would know if you'd ever
accepted my invitation to dinner.


71
00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:42.951
How's eh...
how's Brandon holding up?


72
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.677
He's far too worse to be getting better.

73
00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:50.822
So with the fine woman like yourself?

74
00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:53.424
He must want to hang around.

75
00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:08.315
The Explosion left six dead,
including three children.


76
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.600
The IRA is believed to
be behind the bombing,


77
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.916
though they have yet
to claim responsibility.


78
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.840
Anyone with information about the
attack is encouraged to come forward.


79
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.946
Alright, quieten down.

80
00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.509
I can't say enough about this next person.

81
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.030
He's done more for this
town than we deserve.


82
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.628
A man of many talents, in fact,

83
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.100
with a little encouragement
perhaps he'd treat us here tonight.


84
00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:15.900
Bart McGuiness.

85
00:10:16.057 --> 00:10:17.257
Would you honor us with a song?

86
00:10:17.755 --> 00:10:21.517
Oh, no, all you kind folk.
Oughten you to know a fella sing


87
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.304
To me own flesh and
kin, where are you Ma?

88
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:36.911
I wished I had you in Carrickfergus,

89
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:47.138
Only for nights in Ballygrand,

90
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.536
I would swim over,

91
00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:56.029
The deepest ocean...

92
00:10:56.442 --> 00:11:01.237
The deepest ocean for my love...

93
00:11:58.791 --> 00:12:00.391
Right, out you come.

94
00:12:21.943 --> 00:12:23.263
You'll not just shoot me here.

95
00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:25.086
Save us both this exercise.

96
00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:26.476
Keep walking, right to the left.

97
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560
Here will be fine.

98
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.440
Two steps to your right.

99
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.120
Start digging.

100
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.410
Where are we?

101
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.880
If I'm going to spend eternity here,

102
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.135
nice to know where I am.

103
00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:12.553
Donegal.

104
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.140
You're in Donegal, the
other end of the country.


105
00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:22.463
The Forgotten County.
Seems fitting.


106
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.970
And this is how you earn a living.

107
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.480
She's deep enough.
Out you get.


108
00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:39.053
On your knees.

109
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.881
Jesus.

110
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.737
All these trees.

111
00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:52.726
You've been busy.

112
00:13:54.306 --> 00:13:55.306
On your knees.

113
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.700
Hands behind the old head there.

114
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.460
You have one minute.

115
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320
Say what you will.

116
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.900
Plead if you want.

117
00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:11.039
Makes no odds.

118
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.401
No pleading necessary.

119
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.324
I knew this day was coming.

120
00:14:18.706 --> 00:14:20.631
Mind you, it took longer than I thought.

121
00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:23.744
It was a lifetime ago.

122
00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:31.498
Had a fierce temper as a lad.

123
00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:34.418
Did my share of killing.

124
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:41.674
I knew that there was, there was
no going back to what I'd done.


125
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.587
But one day I decided that
whatever was left of my withering soul


126
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:49.589
shouldn't be wasted, so...

127
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.712
somehow, I...

128
00:14:53.969 --> 00:14:56.097
I blew that black cloud away.

129
00:14:57.616 --> 00:14:59.231
Became part of the community.

130
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.328
Did what I could for those around me.

131
00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:09.096
You know, this is where it ends

132
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.165
for people like us.

133
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.082
In some windswept boggy patch.

134
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.721
Try to do some good
before you find yourself here.


135
00:15:23.349 --> 00:15:24.969
You've only so much time.

136
00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:39.694
Ah, but my days are numbered.

137
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:47.536
Come all you young men
and lay me down.


138
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.080
So any hiccups then, Kev?
- No, nothing.


139
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.255
You queer, Robert?

140
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.095
Your music suggests you're queer.

141
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.818
You slow, Kev?

142
00:17:07.398 --> 00:17:09.717
Your boots suggest you're slow.

143
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.968
Can't imagine what kind of
mess you left out there.


144
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.965
That's a brilliant Moody Blues 45.

145
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.682
I'm gonna borrow this one.

146
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.648
Indulgence draws the
weak to an early grave.


147
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.138
Who's that? Yeats?

148
00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:40.226
It's my mother.

149
00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.180
Who's that?
- Only me, Mrs. McQue.


150
00:17:52.473 --> 00:17:54.485
Oh, Finbar, how are ya?

151
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.020
Robbie said you were coming in.

152
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.160
So I made your favorite scones for ya.

153
00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.022
Oh, cherry, huh?
- Raisin.


154
00:18:01.544 --> 00:18:02.679
I thought it was raisin.

155
00:18:02.813 --> 00:18:05.315
Raisin it is.
You know me better than I know myself.


156
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.760
I thought so.

157
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.800
I thought so.

158
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.320
You'll take them with you then.

159
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.085
I will.

160
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.640
You've never not taken them.

161
00:18:14.066 --> 00:18:16.755
Ah, good fuckin'' mornin', ya beauts.

162
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460
That was hot.

163
00:18:19.605 --> 00:18:21.085
Hey, hey, hey, manners.

164
00:18:22.006 --> 00:18:23.006
There he is.

165
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.195
The fastest hand in the West.

166
00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.799
No, that was a Dublin mile.

167
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.705
Kids nowadays.

168
00:18:32.813 --> 00:18:33.813
Oh, God.

169
00:18:35.253 --> 00:18:36.253
Here we are.

170
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.380
Oh, yourself.

171
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.340
Hey.

172
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.520
Oh, new addition.

173
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.670
I took it as payment
from the O'Reilly clan.


174
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.540
Some Mexican fella painted it.

175
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.600
Quite en-vogue in America, apparently.

176
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.468
Worth a lot more than I was owed.

177
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.200
Too bad you can't sell a
back to its rightful owner.


178
00:19:03.374 --> 00:19:05.079
Oh, uh, keep an eye out.

179
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.760
I'll have something else
for ya in a week or so.


180
00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:14.769
Give it to him.

181
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.230
The job.

182
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.090
Give it to him.

183
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.150
All of them.

184
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.105
Been thinking quite a bit lately.

185
00:19:27.997 --> 00:19:32.644
Been a lifetime of poor choices I've made,
Robert, ever since Margaret died, you know.


186
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.622
I mean, there's more to me than this.

187
00:19:37.993 --> 00:19:39.588
I'd like folks to see it.

188
00:19:42.969 --> 00:19:47.755
Oh, and, uh, what is it you're
so anxious to show the world?


189
00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:49.661
This is all you know.

190
00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:55.928
I could plant a garden.

191
00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.576
A garden.
- Aye.


192
00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:07.208
So...
you're just going to jilt me?


193
00:20:07.676 --> 00:20:09.837
Well, leave me with that gone bean.

194
00:20:27.866 --> 00:20:29.364
Thanks.

195
00:20:35.456 --> 00:20:36.648
You gonna miss me?

196
00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:42.597
Aye...
like a hole in the head.


197
00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:55.192
It's seeds do you want?
- Aye, Bob, seeds.


198
00:21:55.752 --> 00:21:57.580
You're not one for buying seeds, ever.

199
00:21:57.993 --> 00:21:59.455
No, not before.

200
00:22:01.223 --> 00:22:02.633
You're sure that, seeds?

201
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.748
At least. Have you got any or not?
- Alright.


202
00:22:06.307 --> 00:22:07.307
We have, uh,

203
00:22:08.774 --> 00:22:11.394
broad beans, cabbage, some of carrots,

204
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.504
and there's some
regular stuff there too.


205
00:22:44.788 --> 00:22:47.290
So, I was thinking I could
start a garden in my own.


206
00:22:47.438 --> 00:22:48.860
A bit of popple.

207
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.226
Maybe some goldenrod.

208
00:22:51.566 --> 00:22:54.168
Like that yellow wave
you've got going out there.


209
00:22:55.259 --> 00:22:57.728
Goldenrod is a weed, Finbar.

210
00:23:00.606 --> 00:23:01.714
Didn't know that.

211
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.845
Might need a teacher, so.

212
00:23:06.206 --> 00:23:07.042
Is it okay?

213
00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:10.008
I don't know what I'm enjoying more,
the food or the company.


214
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.364
Was your wife a good cook?

215
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.215
Margaret, was it?

216
00:23:20.618 --> 00:23:22.180
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't...


217
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.460
No, no, no. You're
fine. You're fine.


218
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.130
Just... it's just been so long since
I've heard her name spoken.


219
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160
Margaret.

220
00:23:31.793 --> 00:23:33.288
Always experimenting.

221
00:23:35.053 --> 00:23:36.053
She baked this brick.

222
00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:37.781
This was a long time ago.

223
00:23:38.986 --> 00:23:41.665
Put apples and nuts into the mix.

224
00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:44.917
Wee bit of cinnamon thrown in there.

225
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.048
Never tasted the like of it.
- Oh, sounds gorgeous.


226
00:23:48.576 --> 00:23:50.061
Jesus, no, it was awful.

227
00:23:51.053 --> 00:23:52.053
It's like I said.

228
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.274
I never tasted the like of it.

229
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.615
And thankfully, 
I never did again.

230
00:23:58.413 --> 00:23:59.413
Was this in Dublin?

231
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.864
Aye.
Sure.


232
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.208
Passed the bookshop where
she worked every day.


233
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.048
Walking to the factory, you know.

234
00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:07.998
God, she loved those books.

235
00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.551
It got me hooked.

236
00:24:11.126 --> 00:24:12.410
I wish I could have met her.

237
00:24:12.899 --> 00:24:14.999
Well, she was too
good for me, that woman.

238
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.507
The same as yourself.

239
00:24:24.893 --> 00:24:26.594
I'll just be a wee minute...

240
00:24:40.097 --> 00:24:41.230
How is it Moya?

241
00:24:43.089 --> 00:24:45.105
If you hook a rod,
be careful because that line


242
00:24:45.363 --> 00:24:47.223
could cut into the palm
of your hand, darling.


243
00:24:47.556 --> 00:24:48.556
Here.

244
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.394
Come on, use that.

245
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.651
There you go.
Good girl.


246
00:24:57.123 --> 00:24:58.537
What are you hoping to catch?

247
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:03.030
The goldfish?
Take him home. Call him Goldie.


248
00:25:03.873 --> 00:25:05.367
A fish wouldn't care for ya.

249
00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:07.473
And my dead Daddy used
to say that you shouldn't


250
00:25:07.518 --> 00:25:09.096
care for those that
don't care for you.


251
00:25:10.163 --> 00:25:11.327
Hm, fair enough.

252
00:25:11.696 --> 00:25:13.593
I was told to
catch a fish for dinner.

253
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.560
You're on.

254
00:25:20.813 --> 00:25:22.831
Let some line out.
Let some line out.


255
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.235
Moya...
It's okay. Moya!


256
00:25:58.113 --> 00:25:59.551
Hey, Pat.

257
00:26:03.793 --> 00:26:06.100
Pleasure, Sinéad.
- Finbar.


258
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.387
Surprised to see you
on a night like this.

259
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.276
- Catherine.
- Finbar. He is grumpy tonight.


260
00:26:12.573 --> 00:26:14.211
That old bastard?
Never in your life.


261
00:26:14.438 --> 00:26:16.361
Aye.
And this is my one night out.


262
00:26:16.411 --> 00:26:18.733
A pint of plain for the
grumpy bollocks, Sinéad...


263
00:26:19.027 --> 00:26:21.474
And a wee bit cider for
his long suffering wife.


264
00:26:21.784 --> 00:26:23.636
I'll have a wee Black Bush, please.

265
00:26:23.879 --> 00:26:28.521
Flashing the cash, eh? How trading books
ever earned you a living I'll never know.


266
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.385
As long as I keep winning
money off you, I'll do just fine.


267
00:26:33.953 --> 00:26:36.411
Any luck catching
your Evel Knievel boy?


268
00:26:36.633 --> 00:26:37.713
Ah, not a bit of it.

269
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.464
Now, it hasn't been the most
fruitful of days, I have to admit.


270
00:26:40.464 --> 00:26:41.908
But... I'll get him.

271
00:26:42.333 --> 00:26:43.575
I'm sure you will.

272
00:26:54.639 --> 00:26:55.742
A water, please?

273
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.727
Fine fiddling there, son.

274
00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.346
Thank you, my friend.
That's an old tune.


275
00:27:00.622 --> 00:27:03.311
Old as the hills, but
it always has a place.


276
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.652
You say that here?
"Old as the hills"?


277
00:27:05.886 --> 00:27:08.146
We call it a jig.
- Of course.


278
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.620
Thank you.
- So what brought you over here?


279
00:27:12.014 --> 00:27:15.355
Long ago, an Irishman
came to my village,


280
00:27:15.975 --> 00:27:18.320
playing the most beautiful
song I'd ever heard.


281
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.767
He left before I could learn it,
so I just had to come.


282
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.120
Do you not miss it?
Home.


283
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.275
I do not miss the fighting.

284
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.488
I do not miss the blood.

285
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:38.821
Sinéad, I saw your Moya out by
the bridge, fishing for dinner.


286
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.927
Sounds like my wee 'un all right.

287
00:27:41.286 --> 00:27:42.654
She's her own woman.

288
00:27:43.136 --> 00:27:44.946
We're like ships passing in the night.

289
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.725
Me working here all
the hours God sends.


290
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.520
Well, don't be giving her too much grief.

291
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.520
Why's that?

292
00:27:50.666 --> 00:27:53.142
The box of grub,
it tumbled into the river.


293
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.718
What?

294
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.372
But that's on me.
I was yapping and distracting her.


295
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.794
Great. Well, thanks for the heads up.

296
00:28:39.173 --> 00:28:41.058
I know that look.

297
00:28:43.072 --> 00:28:44.488
Where are you after?

298
00:28:45.963 --> 00:28:48.478
Surely you're not fleeing
over the spilled food.


299
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.240
Are ya?
I told your ma it was all my doing.


300
00:28:55.596 --> 00:28:57.505
She's going to miss you
something shocking.


301
00:28:57.927 --> 00:28:59.392
Stuck out here alone.

302
00:28:59.723 --> 00:29:01.697
And you off riding the plains.

303
00:29:03.893 --> 00:29:05.451
You're brave and loyal.

304
00:29:05.616 --> 00:29:07.544
I've seen those horses hit the dark.

305
00:29:09.473 --> 00:29:13.697
Scared stiff of the rabbit holes
and the rabbits.


306
00:29:14.323 --> 00:29:16.382
Best to run away during the day.

307
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.935
So you don't, you know, run
into anything unexpected.


308
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.018
But, up to you, I suppose,
you're the boss.


309
00:29:43.936 --> 00:29:45.874
You're not still on the caravan.

310
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.152
Aye, mom says the bungalow
will never be done.


311
00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.462
You can go now.

312
00:29:54.073 --> 00:29:56.331
What?
You can go now.


313
00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:59.821
No, no, a gentleman always
leaves the lady to the door.


314
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.280
I said I'm fine.

315
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.780
Moya, what the fuck?
Where've ya been?


316
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.361
I'm fucking starving here.

317
00:30:05.753 --> 00:30:07.881
Who's this?
- A gentleman.


318
00:30:08.055 --> 00:30:10.216
Oh, just like your real uncle Curtis then.

319
00:30:10.326 --> 00:30:11.587
You're not my uncle.

320
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.662
Here, you watch your back talk.
Do you hear me?


321
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.660
Women, eh?

322
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.994
Fuckin' nightmares.

323
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.550
Oh, if it isn't the wanderer,
back from his traveling.


324
00:30:59.763 --> 00:31:02.044
- About time.
- I came straight away, just when we get in.


325
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.134
What the fuck is this?

326
00:31:05.343 --> 00:31:06.343
Apples?

327
00:31:06.453 --> 00:31:07.770
I don't know,
it's what they give me.


328
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:09.530
You've been gone for three hours
and you come back with apples.


329
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:10.950
Is there something
fucking wrong with you?


330
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:11.950
Hey!

331
00:31:12.044 --> 00:31:13.054
Shut the fuck up.

332
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.990
How the fuck does
he to be your brother?

333
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.003
He's don't even sound the same.

334
00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:19.250
It is none of your business.

335
00:31:21.896 --> 00:31:23.514
What were you doing all this time?

336
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.190
I've just been waiting
down the caravan.


337
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.330
There's no need to be
hanging around down there.


338
00:31:28.496 --> 00:31:30.416
You just get what we need
and then you come back.


339
00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:31.914
Do you understand?

340
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:48.481
Knock knock.

341
00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:51.148
Oh, Jesus.

342
00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.855
Finbar I mean. Thank you.

343
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.441
Watch it, it's heavy?

344
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.467
Will you take a cup of tea?
- No, no, thanks, girl.


345
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.274
How's Moya?

346
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.847
What have you got there?

347
00:32:12.493 --> 00:32:13.835
Not got anything.

348
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.271
Maybe I should ask your mother.

349
00:32:16.303 --> 00:32:19.240
No, please.
Don't say anything to her.


350
00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:22.239
Show me.

351
00:32:24.383 --> 00:32:25.513
Come on, show me.

352
00:32:34.273 --> 00:32:35.453
Where did you get this?

353
00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:39.399
Did your uncle give you this?

354
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.540
He's not my uncle.

355
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.255
Why did he give this to you, Moya?

356
00:32:47.316 --> 00:32:50.627
Does it have something to do with these...
these bruises on you?


357
00:32:52.993 --> 00:32:53.993
Moya.

358
00:32:56.956 --> 00:32:58.908
Did something happen

359
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.525
you don't want me to tell me about?

360
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.434
Yo, Moya.

361
00:33:21.752 --> 00:33:23.843
So the gentleman caller returns.

362
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.668
Morning, Sinéad.

363
00:33:26.893 --> 00:33:28.168
Morning, Moya.

364
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:32.551
Hope you're not thinking about
making a move in our Sinéad.


365
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.305
She's a wee bit
young for you, I'd say.

366
00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.585
Shut your hole, Curtis.

367
00:33:36.653 --> 00:33:38.433
Mind him, Finbar.
He's an arsehole.


368
00:33:38.522 --> 00:33:41.046
What, I can't even have a wee
bit of chitchat with the locals.


369
00:33:41.966 --> 00:33:44.585
Me and him are sweet.
Ain't I right, big man?


370
00:33:45.653 --> 00:33:47.061
Ah, here we go.

371
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.196
Nothing like a wee bit of skinny
dip to work up an appetite.


372
00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:51.472
Take it and go.

373
00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:53.298
I'll bring you more tonight after work.

374
00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.388
I'm going off my fucking neighbours.

375
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.040
Can't blame me for wanting
a wee bit of a new company.


376
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.020
Fuck you.

377
00:34:01.346 --> 00:34:02.851
Catch you later, Princess.

378
00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:07.679
Old friend.

379
00:34:08.396 --> 00:34:09.752
You can pick your friends.

380
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:12.211
You don't get to choose
your bloody in laws.


381
00:34:13.453 --> 00:34:14.453
I, um...

382
00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:17.614
My brother married his sister.

383
00:34:18.086 --> 00:34:19.890
Then promptly got himself killed.

384
00:34:21.376 --> 00:34:23.064
I can't wait to
see the back of him.

385
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.191
I thought you were all for
leaving this business behind.


386
00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:46.926
Give it to that wee bollocks, Kevin.

387
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.290
I'd pay.

388
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:49.490
Are you wise?

389
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.262
A local fella?

390
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.555
You want the boys
in blue at your door?

391
00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:56.808
His clan isn't from here.

392
00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:57.970
He's a blow in.

393
00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.051
With a name of Curtis...
- I don't care.


394
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:02.254
Not on our doorstep.

395
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.474
Besides, he could be IRA.

396
00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:08.779
Good luck staying away from
them fellows for the rest of your life.


397
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.885
So, we just let
him keep on hurting her.

398
00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:13.765
You don't even know what he's done.
- I know.


399
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.587
I could see it in her eyes.

400
00:35:15.763 --> 00:35:17.985
And that's his message
for her to keep quiet.


401
00:35:18.413 --> 00:35:19.663
Jesus, she's a child, Robert.

402
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.884
Shop him to the guards.
An anonymous tip off.


403
00:35:22.023 --> 00:35:24.884
Conscious clean.
- She'll never tell him what he's done.


404
00:35:25.173 --> 00:35:28.341
He's put the fear of God in her.
And he'll never stop.


405
00:35:28.549 --> 00:35:30.308
He'll just go on tormenting others.

406
00:35:30.669 --> 00:35:34.322
Robert, I know what I said about killing.
But this is different.


407
00:35:35.237 --> 00:35:37.715
I want no part of it, Finbar.

408
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.937
Count me out.

409
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.717
Taking your brogues for a walk?

410
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.441
So, you actually can talk, huh?

411
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.564
Only when I'm done listening.

412
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.240
Passing by Sinéad's. Hop in,
I'll give you a lift.


413
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.420
Aye.

414
00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:43.646
So, you're on holiday, eh?
- Aye, holiday. Fuck up.


415
00:36:44.403 --> 00:36:46.924
Couldn't get out to Mallorca,
fixed my farmer's time, but nah.
could have nipped off to


416
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.901
That's all squat in the bag,
ours are bleeding fucking nowhere.


417
00:36:52.113 --> 00:36:54.500
Listen, there's cigarettes
in the front there, help yourself.


418
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.998
The matches are on the floor.

419
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.441
Funny, the road never looks
the same on the way back.


420
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.938
That's 'cause giants made these hills.

421
00:37:19.576 --> 00:37:20.964
Aye, is that right?

422
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.572
This land was once ruled by Famoreans.

423
00:37:25.103 --> 00:37:27.025
God like seafarers, they were.

424
00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:30.795
Slaved the land, ate their
children, so the story goes.


425
00:37:34.743 --> 00:37:36.828
Now, to think I just
used them for shooting.


426
00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:38.330
You're a hunter?

427
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:42.551
Well, if you call shooting bean cans
and the odd jackrabbit hunting,


428
00:37:43.237 --> 00:37:45.115
then yes, I'm a stupendous hunter.

429
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:46.890
What do you use?

430
00:37:47.363 --> 00:37:50.362
A smooth bore.
A. H. Fox.


431
00:37:51.016 --> 00:37:53.935
Teddy Roosevelt called it
the finest gun ever made.


432
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.150
You wanna see it?

433
00:37:59.213 --> 00:38:03.688
I had a Remington 17 model
before I got this little baby.


434
00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:05.754
Wasn't as nifty.

435
00:38:06.469 --> 00:38:10.115
Didn't have the same...
boasty qualities.


436
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.821
Beautiful, isn't she?

437
00:38:12.363 --> 00:38:13.602
You want a hold her?

438
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:57.700
- What did I ever do to you?
- Wee Moya, you bastard.


439
00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.630
She's fucking alright.

440
00:39:00.289 --> 00:39:03.452
I'll leave.
You'll never fucking see me again.


441
00:39:18.806 --> 00:39:19.806
You're fucking dead.

442
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.168
You're...

443
00:39:35.843 --> 00:39:38.108
Some ginger Jesse Owens, he was.

444
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.467
Why'd he have a knife?

445
00:39:42.201 --> 00:39:44.445
Is that something
all the young ones carry?


446
00:39:44.939 --> 00:39:47.750
Wouldn't consider meself in tune
with modern youth, to be fair.


447
00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:49.508
What are you doing out here?

448
00:39:50.086 --> 00:39:51.978
Robert asked me to check up on you.

449
00:39:53.687 --> 00:39:55.042
Oh he did, did he?

450
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.094
Yeah.

451
00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.781
Well, in that case...

452
00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:02.682
I like bingo, yeah?

453
00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:05.700
Royce has a session on tonight.
You'll pay for me books.


454
00:40:07.953 --> 00:40:09.792
What a cheeky point that too, eh.

455
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.938
Oh, now I'll bury you,
and almost I'll get down.


456
00:40:15.173 --> 00:40:16.518
Get down.

457
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.900
Christ.

458
00:40:23.506 --> 00:40:25.628
Starting to understand why
they whinge so much.


459
00:40:30.007 --> 00:40:31.695
This yahoo one time.

460
00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:35.571
Taken away, so he was.
But he knew


461
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.618
that when he stopped, that was that.
Yeah?


462
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:41.138
End of the line.

463
00:40:42.243 --> 00:40:44.155
So he just didn't stop.

464
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.463
Must've been something like
nine feet when he was done with it.


465
00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:50.093
Blisters the size of plums.

466
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.506
Who knows?
He could've hit fecking Fiji or some place.


467
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.579
I just stood and laughed.

468
00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.448
That was something else.

469
00:40:58.279 --> 00:41:00.455
It's all a big
joke to you, isn't it?

470
00:41:01.053 --> 00:41:02.053
This line of work.

471
00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:04.322
Oh, well.

472
00:41:05.033 --> 00:41:06.647
As my dad always used to say,

473
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.082
"Do a job you love."

474
00:41:26.406 --> 00:41:28.986
And the next one up
is stuck in a tree, 53.

475
00:41:29.886 --> 00:41:32.086
Here you go, Finbar.
On me, for yesterday.


476
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.880
Oh for God's sakes.
Sinéad, there's no need.


477
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:34.701
Hey, love.

478
00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.740
Can I have one?

479
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.560
Which part, Kevin.

480
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.017
She's a feisty one.

481
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.512
Reminds me of one I left
in a forest not long ago.


482
00:41:49.293 --> 00:41:50.993
A woman?
- Yeah.


483
00:41:51.846 --> 00:41:56.321
I'm more... eh... collected in the
fellas, don't you think?


484
00:41:56.787 --> 00:41:58.754
More dignity before dying.

485
00:41:58.926 --> 00:42:00.654
Jesus!
- What?


486
00:42:02.047 --> 00:42:03.637
You never?
- No.


487
00:42:04.096 --> 00:42:07.525
There's enough cruel men in this world.
- She was cruel, alright.


488
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.918
Cruel looking.

489
00:42:10.703 --> 00:42:12.184
But the crying took the edge off.

490
00:42:12.482 --> 00:42:13.482
BINGO!

491
00:42:16.366 --> 00:42:19.232
A wee bit messed up
in the head, aren't you?


492
00:42:20.093 --> 00:42:21.655
Says the one.

493
00:42:23.233 --> 00:42:25.354
It's just a bit of money in
me pocket when I need it.


494
00:42:25.553 --> 00:42:28.997
But a body count like yours,
now that's psychotic.


495
00:42:31.223 --> 00:42:34.685
You listen, you wee shite.
Killing is no joking matter to me,


496
00:42:34.838 --> 00:42:36.607
and I'm done with it for good.

497
00:42:36.807 --> 00:42:41.102
But if I ever hear of you having a
laugh at someone else's dying tears,


498
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.097
I'll beat you with my old man hands.

499
00:42:57.491 --> 00:43:00.071
How many people have
you killed altogether?


500
00:44:03.303 --> 00:44:05.127
Conan's mouthing off in there.

501
00:44:11.032 --> 00:44:12.901
You know, the day they
murdered our father,


502
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.592
Curtis was playing football
in the under-twelves.


503
00:44:17.398 --> 00:44:19.367
Little bollocks wasn't half bad.

504
00:44:21.956 --> 00:44:24.704
I never forget picking him up,
telling him what happened.


505
00:44:25.949 --> 00:44:28.457
He just sat there, just looking at me.

506
00:44:28.706 --> 00:44:30.245
He couldn't make sense of it.

507
00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:35.657
Him growing up in Belfast
and me down south from them.


508
00:44:37.097 --> 00:44:39.168
His whole world turned upside down.

509
00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:44.472
And I made him a promise.
I said I'd always look out for him.


510
00:44:47.923 --> 00:44:49.681
Conan says we should clear out.

511
00:44:51.136 --> 00:44:53.976
Make tracks to France or somewhere.
- Not without my brother.


512
00:44:54.607 --> 00:44:56.517
He probably just had a lock-in...

513
00:44:56.863 --> 00:44:58.922
drinking, you know what he's like.

514
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.170
Unless he developed
the power of invisibility,


515
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.618
a course he didn't spend
the night, in a fucking lock-in!


516
00:45:07.207 --> 00:45:09.113
He ain't no fucking pig.

517
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.567
We're not going anywhere without Curtis.

518
00:45:11.643 --> 00:45:13.334
He's fucking left us, Doireann.

519
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.772
He's probably away on home.
No, he's dead if he goes back. We all are.


520
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:18.070
Yeah, I know.

521
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.748
Curtis June and Doireann McCann.

522
00:45:21.935 --> 00:45:24.632
You're the reason we're in this mess.
I knew you would fuck it up.


523
00:45:24.816 --> 00:45:27.271
But we got the bastards, didn't we?
That's what matters.


524
00:45:27.383 --> 00:45:29.116
And what about the kids?
What, were they just collateral?


525
00:45:29.116 --> 00:45:31.451
You know fucking rightly,
I couldn't have predicted that.


526
00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:34.590
You made yourself known.
Me and Séamus, we were in the clear.


527
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.580
They only saw the back of
our heads running up the road.


528
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.498
I saw the back
of her head last night.

529
00:45:42.383 --> 00:45:43.383
The Fuck!

530
00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.617
I'm only easing the tension.

531
00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.644
Where are you going?
- I'm going out to find that sad bastard


532
00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:51.277
whose only job was to lay low.

533
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.990
Could say he's doing
that only too fucking well.


534
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.870
You cunts want to leave, that's grand.

535
00:45:56.061 --> 00:46:00.174
Just don't be expecting big fucking hugs
when you get back to Belfast.


536
00:46:30.325 --> 00:46:31.693
Curtis!

537
00:46:33.959 --> 00:46:35.999
Hey, sister. What are you
doing out of the bungalow?


538
00:46:36.054 --> 00:46:38.485
Yesterday, did Curtis say
where he was heading?


539
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.588
I didn't see him yesterday.

540
00:46:42.293 --> 00:46:43.718
So he's missing?

541
00:46:43.935 --> 00:46:45.024
Oh, Thank God...

542
00:46:50.629 --> 00:46:52.708
I should never have
let you back in my life.


543
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:57.568
Go on, pack your shit, I want you's gone.
- Don't you dare speak to me like that.


544
00:46:57.708 --> 00:46:59.960
I'll fucking rip that
tongue from your throat.


545
00:47:00.313 --> 00:47:01.741
Maybe the paver's got him.

546
00:47:02.247 --> 00:47:04.928
They're probably closing in the
rest of you sorry fucking bastards.


547
00:47:06.713 --> 00:47:10.503
I'm fighting for a free Ireland.
And that includes you. You cunt.


548
00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:13.011
So you better start showing
me some fucking respect.


549
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.862
What did he tell you?

550
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:21.011
Mama..

551
00:47:21.991 --> 00:47:23.276
He said nothing.

552
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.462
But I'm not stupid, Doireann.

553
00:47:25.803 --> 00:47:27.148
I read the papers.

554
00:47:27.573 --> 00:47:30.010
I'm okay, love, I'm okay.

555
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.901
Here, he swam most days.
Maybe he fucking drowned.


556
00:48:24.953 --> 00:48:27.431
Jesus, here you're going
letting your age get to you.


557
00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:32.867
I suppose the front line would make
a decent shot out of any man.


558
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.951
Now what's your excuse?
- Ah, sure, I was among the last to arrive.


559
00:48:37.129 --> 00:48:39.210
You know, I never knew
the hell of war that you did.


560
00:48:39.346 --> 00:48:41.924
For me, the liberation
of France was... eh...


561
00:48:42.175 --> 00:48:44.696
just a load of faffing about,
if I'm perfectly honest.


562
00:48:44.885 --> 00:48:46.703
Did they mock ye as well,
when you came back?


563
00:48:46.996 --> 00:48:49.397
Well, they're certainly weren't
up to making me feel good about it.


564
00:48:49.397 --> 00:48:52.437
But I was determined to help
fight the Nazi bastards,


565
00:48:52.569 --> 00:48:54.870
even if it meant siding with the English.

566
00:48:55.506 --> 00:48:57.496
But that's why I wear the uniform.

567
00:48:57.631 --> 00:49:00.342
You know, I know right, I know wrong.

568
00:49:00.926 --> 00:49:02.662
And you need the black and white.

569
00:49:02.807 --> 00:49:05.142
Oh, the state of
the North at the minute.

570
00:49:06.149 --> 00:49:08.535
And I've seen enough
fighting for a lifetime.


571
00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.290
Hey!
There you go.


572
00:49:13.003 --> 00:49:15.007
Did anyone come out here?
Does anyone know?


573
00:49:15.573 --> 00:49:17.476
- Not one soul.
- So he could be back in Belfast then.


574
00:49:17.476 --> 00:49:19.716
If he is, I'd fucking
kick him back to you myself.


575
00:49:20.433 --> 00:49:21.954
What if special branches are onto us?

576
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.577
- No way, no. Of course they're not.
- Then fuck off!


577
00:49:24.913 --> 00:49:26.462
Just give me something!

578
00:49:26.623 --> 00:49:29.838
Local Intel, any names around here,
someone who'd know!


579
00:49:30.183 --> 00:49:31.183
Where are you again?

580
00:49:31.423 --> 00:49:32.525
Glen gal something...

581
00:49:32.616 --> 00:49:33.616
I suppose.

582
00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.727
The best hiding spots are ones
you can't fucking pronounce.


583
00:49:37.637 --> 00:49:40.544
There's an old contact close by.
Freelance, old man.


584
00:49:40.773 --> 00:49:42.755
- Have you got a pen?
- Yeah, yeah.


585
00:49:58.633 --> 00:50:00.200
No, stay back.

586
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.136
- Robert McQue?
- No knock?


587
00:50:12.573 --> 00:50:13.701
Force of habit.

588
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.305
Your, uh, colleague

589
00:50:17.737 --> 00:50:20.008
wasn't specific about
the nature of your visit.


590
00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:23.867
Afraid his phone was being tapped
by the big fellas, I suppose, huh?


591
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.345
Oh, bloody paranoid.
- I'm trying to find a friend.


592
00:50:28.807 --> 00:50:31.568
And none know the shadow is
better than those under the rocks.


593
00:50:32.753 --> 00:50:33.901
Oh, I like that.

594
00:50:34.173 --> 00:50:35.715
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

595
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:41.376
And this friend, what's the name?
- Curtis.


596
00:50:42.359 --> 00:50:43.729
Curtis June.

597
00:50:47.092 --> 00:50:49.918
That's a folly of a name, huh?
Was it, June?


598
00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:51.648
Aye.
June.


599
00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:53.612
Is it short for something?

600
00:50:53.749 --> 00:50:55.486
- What is?
- June?


601
00:50:57.333 --> 00:50:59.367
Is June fucking short for something?

602
00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:02.720
It's June, like the month.
June!


603
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.498
I've never in me life
met anyone called June.


604
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.432
Redhead, tall, skinny fella.

605
00:51:10.337 --> 00:51:12.515
That doesn't ring a bell.

606
00:51:13.633 --> 00:51:16.953
You know, those bandits out there in
Inishwest, they might have heard something.


607
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.542
You give them a try.

608
00:51:18.893 --> 00:51:21.038
Now I, I have
to clear up this mess.

609
00:51:21.376 --> 00:51:24.368
If you please find your own way out.

610
00:51:51.253 --> 00:51:52.253
It fits.

611
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.431
I said...
- I heard you.


612
00:51:58.956 --> 00:52:00.684
You're only three foot away from me.

613
00:52:02.056 --> 00:52:03.357
Is he dead?

614
00:52:05.217 --> 00:52:06.328
Without a doubt.

615
00:52:08.099 --> 00:52:09.907
It had nothing to do with me.

616
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:11.130
Who, then?

617
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.310
Tell me or I blow
your fucking head off.


618
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.090
Well, well, well, put it away, will you?

619
00:52:17.619 --> 00:52:19.537
I'm not staking my life for him.

620
00:52:24.504 --> 00:52:25.981
Told him not to do it.

621
00:52:26.093 --> 00:52:29.668
Who?
- Finbar.


622
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:33.562
Finbar Murphy.

623
00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.125
But we parted ways.

624
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:38.360
He's no longer in my employ.

625
00:52:38.486 --> 00:52:40.620
Who called the hit?
- You'd have to ask him that.


626
00:52:40.846 --> 00:52:42.927
Where does he live?
- I don't know.


627
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:47.700
Now, if you don't mind, I would be
very grateful if you would get the...


628
00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:15.161
Robbie?
Robbie?


629
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.792
Robbie's not here anymore.

630
00:53:19.077 --> 00:53:22.198
Where is he?
- I shot him.


631
00:53:23.835 --> 00:53:27.532
Believe me, he had it coming. I'm
not trying to be disrespectful or nothing.


632
00:53:30.103 --> 00:53:31.515
What's your name, love?

633
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:33.850
Josie.

634
00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:36.762
You've a sweet voice, Josie.

635
00:53:37.826 --> 00:53:39.674
I'm sure you've done nothing wrong.

636
00:53:40.776 --> 00:53:43.861
But I can't let you go
seeing my face now, can I?


637
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:47.510
No.
- No.


638
00:53:48.886 --> 00:53:52.131
So why don't you go into your
bedroom back there, lock your door,


639
00:53:52.314 --> 00:53:54.219
and don't come out until I'm gone?

640
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.399
Robbie isn't going anywhere.

641
00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.340
Put that away.

642
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.230
Take a look at this.

643
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:22.290
Blood money.

644
00:54:23.643 --> 00:54:24.781
Fuckin' massacre.

645
00:54:29.327 --> 00:54:30.768
Well, thanks again, Rita.

646
00:54:31.049 --> 00:54:33.112
Oh, wait a minute.

647
00:54:36.429 --> 00:54:40.202
I'll teach you bits whenever you start
planting, but I can't remember everything.


648
00:54:40.333 --> 00:54:43.045
Books help. You done good.

649
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:44.570
I's a start.

650
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:46.890
Good night.
- Night.


651
00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:56.550
It's Robert.

652
00:55:08.542 --> 00:55:09.173
Finbar...

653
00:55:09.279 --> 00:55:12.364
Oh, Mrs. McQue.
- Thanks for coming.


654
00:55:12.616 --> 00:55:13.616
Finbar?

655
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:29.055
- Finbar.
- No, no, no, Mrs. McQue. Don't.


656
00:55:29.163 --> 00:55:30.512
Robbie was a good man.

657
00:55:31.001 --> 00:55:32.535
Of course he fuckin' wasn't.

658
00:55:32.704 --> 00:55:35.441
Oi... For what he was,
he was a good man.


659
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.978
Did you see who he was?
- Oh, it was a her.


660
00:55:39.176 --> 00:55:40.391
And no, I didn't.

661
00:55:40.727 --> 00:55:42.997
She was talking to Robbie, though.

662
00:55:43.469 --> 00:55:45.848
She said she was looking
for someone named Curtis.


663
00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.515
The ginger Jesse?

664
00:55:48.583 --> 00:55:49.914
She'll need a shovel.

665
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:51.570
We can't stay here.

666
00:55:52.036 --> 00:55:53.868
Good.
Fucking hate waits.


667
00:55:53.889 --> 00:55:56.941
Go and siphon some petrol.
Mrs. McQue, go in the kitchen.


668
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:58.890
Please.
- All right.


669
00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.611
I'll sort this out.

670
00:56:06.825 --> 00:56:08.855
Everyone knows each
other in these small towns.


671
00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:11.290
They'll know him.
- But why does it have to be me?


672
00:56:11.737 --> 00:56:14.547
Because you always
look lost. Now go.


673
00:56:29.896 --> 00:56:31.191
Good evening.

674
00:56:38.385 --> 00:56:41.381
I'm off for the weekend.
Visiting my uncle.


675
00:56:41.643 --> 00:56:44.514
We've got a bit ...eh... turned around.

676
00:56:44.756 --> 00:56:47.401
You wouldn't happen to
know a Finbar Murphy.


677
00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:49.210
Finbar?

678
00:56:49.703 --> 00:56:50.703
Know him all right.

679
00:56:56.603 --> 00:56:58.204
Lives up the road there.

680
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.302
Oh, for fuck sake.

681
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.060
Evening, Guard.

682
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.220
Evening.

683
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:36.590
You want me to fill her up?
- Huh? Yeah.


684
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:39.831
Ever see that fellow around here before?

685
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.975
Never have.

686
00:57:43.581 --> 00:57:45.861
Says he's up to see his Uncle Finbar.
- Finbar?


687
00:57:48.474 --> 00:57:51.774
No, Don's never said he had a nephew.

688
00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.620
Aye, look at this. Beautiful.

689
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.677
How do you suppose they found him?

690
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.520
Maybe he asked his network
about this Curtis fella.


691
00:59:14.705 --> 00:59:16.875
Checked on you after you spoke to them.

692
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:27.594
Just wait for you outside, then.
How long you'll be?


693
00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.584
Pull over there.

694
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:06.791
Something spook ya?

695
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:09.438
Somebody's in my house.

696
01:00:13.979 --> 01:00:16.371
Well, that's me un-employed then, I suppose.

697
01:00:20.643 --> 01:00:23.372
Old Robert took advantage of me,
but he treated me right.


698
01:00:24.453 --> 01:00:25.985
He'd say you was a friend?

699
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.622
We had things in common.

700
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.438
Things to keep hidden.

701
01:00:31.933 --> 01:00:33.492
But you're a runaway?

702
01:00:34.293 --> 01:00:35.777
Your home is an old pile of shite

703
01:00:35.823 --> 01:00:38.747
and there's no love to be had,
I hardly call it running away.


704
01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:42.214
Escaping's more like it.

705
01:00:45.673 --> 01:00:49.832
One night, I got myself
into a fierce bust up in a pub.


706
01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.885
But I come out of it on top.

707
01:00:52.489 --> 01:00:54.161
And there Robert was.

708
01:00:55.088 --> 01:00:56.772
Buying me as many pints as I wanted,

709
01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.855
and offered me thirty quid to
push some fella off a pier.


710
01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.561
Of course I didn't know
he was getting 130,


711
01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:05.002
but that was Robert, the
old sleeve and bastard.


712
01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:11.482
It was easy money.

713
01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:19.705
Uh, I lost track long ago

714
01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:22.881
how many I've killed.

715
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.012
The war had turned me into
somebody I didn't recognize.


716
01:01:31.227 --> 01:01:34.415
And when I came home and
learned my Margaret had died,


717
01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.391
whatever was left of my old self

718
01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:40.297
had seemed to disappear into a black hole.

719
01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:45.042
And then Robert came calling.

720
01:01:46.887 --> 01:01:49.245
As you said, it was too easy.

721
01:01:58.659 --> 01:02:01.454
Fuckin' seniors and their raisins.

722
01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:05.835
He's not here by now...

723
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:09.355
He's probably head down watching us.

724
01:02:10.969 --> 01:02:13.904
Well, if he is, let's give
him something to watch.


725
01:02:48.403 --> 01:02:49.621
Nah, Jesus.

726
01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.892
Go back inside, Rita.

727
01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:55.083
Please.

728
01:03:08.545 --> 01:03:11.100
You must be the nosy
fucking neighbor, huh?


729
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.291
You should be minding your own
business if you know what's best.


730
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.980
You know Finbar?

731
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:19.720
Never had the pleasure, but I will.

732
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.600
Mr. Murphy has done something.

733
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.067
Something unforgivable.

734
01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.480
Hey, what are you doing?

735
01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.661
I'm gonna fucking kill her.

736
01:03:28.899 --> 01:03:30.247
We've got no advantage.

737
01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:33.372
Advantage? What's that, war talk?
- Put that down.


738
01:03:33.565 --> 01:03:36.945
I don't want Rita getting
caught in the crossfire.


739
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.075
God, it's lonely out here.

740
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:44.951
Especially for a frail
old one, like yourself.


741
01:03:46.803 --> 01:03:50.057
If you see your friend,
you can give him a message.


742
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.602
I'll tell him a
mighty wee bitch sent it.

743
01:03:55.493 --> 01:03:56.493
Do.

744
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.415
Talk to the cruel...

745
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.678
Conan!
Come on.


746
01:04:29.072 --> 01:04:32.208
Oh God.
Grab her legs.


747
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.505
You go first.

748
01:04:38.923 --> 01:04:40.684
Two cottages down
from the crossroads.


749
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.352
The one with the flowers.

750
01:04:42.602 --> 01:04:45.223
And who is this again?
- For God's sake, it doesn't matter.


751
01:04:45.445 --> 01:04:47.268
Look, you're a doctor. 
Just go to her.

752
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.235
All right?
Please.


753
01:05:01.859 --> 01:05:03.082
Here we are.

754
01:05:05.386 --> 01:05:06.792
Home sweet home.

755
01:05:10.966 --> 01:05:13.732
Here you go.
Good boy.


756
01:05:18.722 --> 01:05:20.668
There's some money's worth here.

757
01:05:21.206 --> 01:05:23.246
No wonder you need someone
to buy your bingo books.


758
01:05:23.997 --> 01:05:26.119
Maybe I just wanted the conversation.

759
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.052
Do you play this thing?

760
01:05:30.768 --> 01:05:32.271
Just a chord or two.

761
01:05:32.373 --> 01:05:34.835
No trainer, I mostly teach meself.

762
01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.634
I'll make my own record someday.

763
01:05:43.855 --> 01:05:48.248
Maybe over there in California, if
we can save enough for the journey.


764
01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:54.085
People over there just
seem... free or something.


765
01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:58.025
Enjoying life, you know what I mean?

766
01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.401
The teams, that's...
- Okay, let's go.


767
01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.962
I don't recall you
buying a paper before.


768
01:06:37.496 --> 01:06:39.572
I don't recall you being sober.

769
01:06:46.813 --> 01:06:50.933
Hey, Pat. Give us 20 Gold, would ya.

770
01:06:55.573 --> 01:06:56.787
Finbar.

771
01:06:58.043 --> 01:07:01.891
Ah, the poor fellow must have been a hermit
out there, for I never saw him in the town.


772
01:07:02.706 --> 01:07:05.448
Went with the name of Robert McQue.

773
01:07:06.186 --> 01:07:08.258
Did you know him at all?

774
01:07:09.563 --> 01:07:12.073
The mother said that there
was a woman that did the killing.


775
01:07:12.626 --> 01:07:14.665
I can't make a head
nor tail of it at all.


776
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:18.999
You know, I was wondering if maybe
the sign had something to do with it.


777
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:21.655
You know, maybe the sign was, a sign.

778
01:07:21.828 --> 01:07:24.233
Anyway, we'll get the
detectives down from Dublin.


779
01:07:24.367 --> 01:07:27.188
There'll be all over it.
There'll be nothing for me to do.


780
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.840
Oh, here.

781
01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.707
You never told me you had a nephew.

782
01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.160
Aye, nice lad.

783
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.768
I don't see him that much.

784
01:07:38.176 --> 01:07:41.067
You mind dropping me by Sinéad's?
- Oh, get in.


785
01:07:50.586 --> 01:07:51.586
Well...

786
01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:53.683
cheers for the ride, Vinny.

787
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.610
Yeah, hey.
Don't be smug about it.


788
01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.570
Can't be seen to have favorites.
- Get on with you.


789
01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.605
Stay low.

790
01:08:59.976 --> 01:09:00.976
Stay out of sight.

791
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:02.731
You come to a fucking football match.

792
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.908
He'll be here.

793
01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:11.551
Rats.
Everywhere fucking rats.


794
01:09:15.076 --> 01:09:16.434
They didn't get your good side.

795
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.680
This pushes us into a corner.
We're gonna have to leg it.


796
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.680
Not yet.

797
01:09:20.136 --> 01:09:21.740
Anybody can recognize us, Doireann.

798
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.174
Curtis is dead.
Try to give an ounce of shit.


799
01:09:32.355 --> 01:09:34.757
Let's burn the fucker's place
then as revenge for Curtis.


800
01:09:35.053 --> 01:09:37.346
Then we get out of here.
We get to Amsterdam, France maybe.


801
01:09:37.346 --> 01:09:39.147
We've got that money,
we can start over.


802
01:09:39.493 --> 01:09:43.778
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Run off and leave Ireland?


803
01:09:44.893 --> 01:09:47.334
So what's the point of all this, then?
- If we want to live...


804
01:09:47.367 --> 01:09:50.731
So they died for nothing?
- For a while, 'til things settle down.


805
01:09:54.226 --> 01:09:57.870
Am I the only one who understands
what we're fighting for here?


806
01:09:58.659 --> 01:10:01.255
We're not fucking leaving.

807
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.880
Someone hired Murphy to kill Curtis.

808
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.577
We need to find out who.

809
01:10:07.086 --> 01:10:09.066
The old lady, the fucking shopkeeper,

810
01:10:09.452 --> 01:10:11.200
someone knows where he is.

811
01:10:13.089 --> 01:10:14.955
We're just gonna have
to pry it from them.

812
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.982
Better find the loo.

813
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.564
Maybe the two of you can come up
with just one fucking idea while I'm gone.


814
01:10:34.586 --> 01:10:35.586
Finbar!

815
01:10:37.306 --> 01:10:40.082
- Hassan.
- My biggest fan.


816
01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.860
See you stuck around.

817
01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:43.479
What do you think?

818
01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.200
They all looks so blood-thirsty,
I don't know who to root for.


819
01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.767
Hey, Sinéad.
- How about you, Finbar?


820
01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.020
Not too bad.

821
01:10:51.505 --> 01:10:53.611
Seen Moya?
- She's around here somewhere.


822
01:10:53.865 --> 01:10:55.408
Up to something, I'm sure.

823
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.237
She's grand. We're good.
- Good.


824
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.001
Okay, I'll see ya.

825
01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.460
See you later tonight.
- Aye.


826
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:37.570
Finbar Murphy.

827
01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:42.115
Deireann McCann.

828
01:11:45.909 --> 01:11:47.043
It's Doireann.

829
01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:49.458
I've only seen it printed.

830
01:11:49.719 --> 01:11:51.725
And they've printed a lot about you lately.

831
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:57.095
You tell me who ordered the hit, or I'll put you
down right here to die in this shit-fed turf.


832
01:11:57.593 --> 01:12:00.191
Look, we've killed each other's friends.
One for the other.


833
01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:02.390
Lets draw the line.
Walk away.


834
01:12:02.684 --> 01:12:05.085
No, no, no. Fuck you.

835
01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:09.188
I killed a degenerate bottom feeder.
Curtis was my brother.


836
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:13.915
Then you must have
known about his tendencies.


837
01:12:18.346 --> 01:12:19.346
Give me the name.

838
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.980
Easy.

839
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.078
All right.
I can bring him to you.


840
01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:24.465
Easier that way.

841
01:12:25.683 --> 01:12:28.868
And you're just going to have this,
whoever, turn himself over?


842
01:12:29.492 --> 01:12:31.711
Convinced the boy
into my car, didn't I?


843
01:12:33.506 --> 01:12:35.580
I'll be back here.
Eight o'clock.


844
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.385
It'll be quiet.
No one will see.


845
01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:40.401
No, fuck right off.
Do you think I'm stupid?


846
01:12:42.716 --> 01:12:43.994
We meet at that pub.

847
01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.418
Wright's?
- That's it.


848
01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:50.113
Full of merry fucking
villagers about that time.


849
01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:52.945
None of who suspect you're a
murdering bastard, I suppose.


850
01:12:53.173 --> 01:12:54.173
So no tricks.

851
01:12:54.793 --> 01:12:57.640
I won't have you hurting anyone
else in this town, do you hear me?


852
01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:58.860
You be there.

853
01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:02.992
Or we leave a special delivery
that'll blow that pub all over Donegal.


854
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:07.440
If that happens to us,
people will come looking.


855
01:13:07.632 --> 01:13:09.332
People who are a lot worse than me.

856
01:13:09.393 --> 01:13:11.833
And they'll tear right through
this god forsaken place.


857
01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.680
And that quaint little
nosy neighbor lady of yours?


858
01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:18.068
Heh.
No one will be safe.


859
01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.480
Fuckin idiot.

860
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:52.892
You take my pistol and
nip off without a pip?


861
01:13:53.813 --> 01:13:55.790
Certainly into your dramatics, aren't you?

862
01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.432
I found the leader.

863
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:59.951
She didn't take to my ceasefire.

864
01:14:00.333 --> 01:14:01.832
She left me no choice.

865
01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.553
I'm gonna finish her.
Finish all of them.


866
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.470
What's your plan on doing that?

867
01:14:07.866 --> 01:14:09.698
It'll be good and public.

868
01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:13.862
So if anyone comes looking
for blood, they'll come for me.


869
01:14:14.153 --> 01:14:15.665
Leave this town out of it.

870
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.040
You can go.
I'll be fine on my own.


871
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.227
No way, Jose.

872
01:14:20.983 --> 01:14:22.753
The great Finbar Murphy's going to war,

873
01:14:23.066 --> 01:14:25.458
I'll be fucked if I'm
missing out on all the fun.


874
01:14:30.039 --> 01:14:31.039
Good boy.

875
01:14:40.133 --> 01:14:41.133
Knock knock.

876
01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:44.066
Moya.

877
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.797
A wee gift for you.

878
01:14:46.593 --> 01:14:48.838
Will you take him?
He's yours.


879
01:14:49.566 --> 01:14:52.641
What's his name?
- You know, I never gave him a name.


880
01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:57.529
What do you think?
- He looks like a Sean.


881
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.080
Aye.

882
01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:01.334
You'll take good care of him, won't you?

883
01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.380
It's good to care,
even if it hurts.


884
01:15:04.853 --> 01:15:05.893
It keeps you human.

885
01:15:06.613 --> 01:15:07.788
Okay?

886
01:15:09.859 --> 01:15:11.017
Bye, Sean.

887
01:15:40.892 --> 01:15:42.355
You want an audience?

888
01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.601
I'll meet them inside.

889
01:15:45.646 --> 01:15:47.332
Tell them I've got the fella out back.

890
01:15:47.546 --> 01:15:49.178
Where I'll be waiting for them.

891
01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.931
Now that's an advantage.

892
01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.580
See?
I was listening.


893
01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.200
No.

894
01:15:58.883 --> 01:16:00.084
I have an advantage of my own.

895
01:16:02.846 --> 01:16:04.766
Go on now.
Take this.


896
01:16:06.679 --> 01:16:08.280
There's an envelope in the outer pocket.

897
01:16:09.109 --> 01:16:10.907
Give it to Robert's mother for me.

898
01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.321
The rest is yours.

899
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.815
What are you getting now?
We agreed...


900
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:16.940
We agreed on nothing.

901
01:16:17.753 --> 01:16:18.753
Now listen.

902
01:16:19.233 --> 01:16:21.275
There's nothing more here for you now.

903
01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560
This is my war.

904
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320
Take that money.

905
01:16:24.859 --> 01:16:26.685
Let it be my hand down to you.

906
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:29.875
You don't have to use that ever again.

907
01:16:30.625 --> 01:16:33.101
You're young.
Find something else to do.


908
01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.440
Get to California.

909
01:16:35.347 --> 01:16:37.828
I'm not saying you need to be
a saint or anything like that.


910
01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.912
Just don't waste your life doing this.

911
01:16:49.113 --> 01:16:50.743
Nobody ever gave me nothing.

912
01:16:53.647 --> 01:16:56.305
My advice is more value
than that money, son.


913
01:16:56.743 --> 01:16:58.303
Trust me on this.

914
01:16:59.483 --> 01:17:00.483
Go on.

915
01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:57.958
Ah, Jesus. Jumpy tonight, aren't we?
- Geez, Vincent,


916
01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:00.577
I've got an old heart.
Aye, but with a young spirit.


917
01:18:00.706 --> 01:18:02.146
Come on.
We're sitting over here.


918
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.790
Black Star isn't a truce.

919
01:18:16.763 --> 01:18:18.515
He didn't try anything at the pitch.

920
01:18:19.096 --> 01:18:20.370
Not with the crowd.

921
01:18:22.023 --> 01:18:23.023
Right.

922
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:26.218
I'll have a peep in first.
Conan, you bring the case in after.


923
01:18:26.529 --> 01:18:27.529
I am?

924
01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:29.402
Because you're shit with a pistol.

925
01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.941
Because I went looking for
Curtis with no help from you.


926
01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:33.645
Because I organized this trade.

927
01:18:33.818 --> 01:18:36.832
And because I fucking said so.

928
01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:39.423
Fine.

929
01:18:39.862 --> 01:18:41.292
Just keep the car lit.

930
01:18:41.936 --> 01:18:45.576
Any foul play, you set that timer
and we get the fuck out, y'hear?


931
01:18:46.703 --> 01:18:49.231
Scorch the bastards.
Sure, half the village is in there.


932
01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.954
And some, who can hang those
dead kids round our necks.


933
01:18:55.256 --> 01:18:59.968
I was hoping for a quieter night tonight.
You know, a few stories, bit of a yarn.


934
01:19:01.573 --> 01:19:03.574
How, you getting on
with yon Russian book?


935
01:19:04.399 --> 01:19:08.410
Not finished it yet.
Dare say you would enjoy it, though.


936
01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.850
Oh.
Bit of mystery?


937
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:11.910
Intrigue, is it?

938
01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:13.250
Aye.

939
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:16.681
There's a clever detective
investigating a gruesome murder.


940
01:19:17.413 --> 01:19:23.046
Name of Porphyry. He's... tenacious
in his quest for the truth.


941
01:19:24.622 --> 01:19:28.915
Drawing out of the suspect, and
too much isolation is destroying him.


942
01:19:30.389 --> 01:19:31.622
Eating away at him.

943
01:19:33.213 --> 01:19:35.792
Making him understand
that the parity ended.


944
01:19:37.649 --> 01:19:38.941
It's all his.

945
01:19:42.473 --> 01:19:45.184
So keen instincts, this detective?

946
01:19:45.909 --> 01:19:48.085
It reminds me of you, actually.

947
01:19:49.757 --> 01:19:53.068
Did he get his man in the end?
- I don't know.


948
01:20:02.293 --> 01:20:04.261
Will your nephew be in tonight?

949
01:20:04.626 --> 01:20:06.162
Or has he moved on?

950
01:20:14.165 --> 01:20:16.295
You don't trade books for a living,

951
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.198
do you, Finbar?

952
01:20:23.336 --> 01:20:24.958
What is it that you do?

953
01:20:26.592 --> 01:20:27.592
Vinnie...

954
01:20:29.332 --> 01:20:30.538
You don't want to know.

955
01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.738
If you need to tell me
something, I could help.


956
01:20:37.759 --> 01:20:40.479
No, Vinnie. You can't.

957
01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.531
Jesus.
Moya, Moya.


958
01:20:51.606 --> 01:20:53.966
Come here. You have to scoot on home.
- Where are you going?


959
01:20:54.293 --> 01:20:56.862
This is no place for wee uns.
- But I'm allowed in the bar.


960
01:20:56.901 --> 01:21:00.839
No, no. Not tonight.
- I just want Sean to meet my ma?


961
01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.600
Not tonight.
- Take Sean and go home now.


962
01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:04.821
- But I...
Sean can meet your ma some other time.


963
01:21:04.918 --> 01:21:06.892
Okay? Go home.
Now.


964
01:23:20.123 --> 01:23:21.474
Quite a crowd?

965
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:22.830
Aye.

966
01:23:23.316 --> 01:23:24.965
And your partners in crime?

967
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:26.944
You said no funny business.

968
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:28.938
They're around to be sure of it.

969
01:23:29.905 --> 01:23:33.110
Now just produce the fucker, like you
said, and you can get back to your music.


970
01:23:35.003 --> 01:23:36.682
We'll meet out back where
we can hear ourselves.


971
01:23:36.682 --> 01:23:42.215
You move from that fucking spot,
and I promise you, I'll shoot you dead.


972
01:23:48.267 --> 01:23:49.268
All right. It was me.

973
01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:53.408
Don't you love how a song can just
fill your heart with joy?


974
01:23:53.653 --> 01:23:54.653
Ha?

975
01:23:55.491 --> 01:23:56.680
The music.

976
01:23:57.739 --> 01:23:59.999
Makes you want to just
grab one of the nearest


977
01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:02.140
young dolls and kiss
the face clean of her.


978
01:24:02.177 --> 01:24:03.547
This how you cunts court?

979
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.840
- How 'm I doing?
Aren't I a bit ripe for your tongue?


980
01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:07.540
Ah.

981
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:10.405
I'd target any
woman who's up for a...


982
01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:11.820
Doireann?

983
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.761
Grateful for your charity, Finbar.

984
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:20.311
But a saint's got to
be a sinner first, don't he?


985
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.680
This him?
- Calm down.


986
01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:22.748
I told you.

987
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.348
It was me.
- Course it's me.


988
01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.121
Now, why don't we all
go out back and... Whoa!


989
01:24:54.852 --> 01:24:56.160
That's mine, you bastard.

990
01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.780
That dumb bitch!
She shot me!


991
01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:22.045
Just letting you know
I'm still here, Doireann!


992
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.225
Jesus. Why the fuck
did you come back?


993
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:39.830
Hassan! Stay down!
Stay down!


994
01:26:50.713 --> 01:26:52.438
Oh yeah, money's in me car.

995
01:26:55.227 --> 01:26:57.958
Guessin' you'll get out to
California before me.


996
01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.925
Finbar?

997
01:30:49.957 --> 01:30:51.915
You lookin' for him to save you?

998
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:56.626
I'm not the one who needs saving.

999
01:30:58.297 --> 01:30:59.677
I've done what I've done.

1000
01:31:00.783 --> 01:31:02.163
I had my reasons.

1001
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:05.030
And the Lord was them.

1002
01:31:09.648 --> 01:31:11.832
I take no judgment from you.

1003
01:31:13.776 --> 01:31:15.562
I'm not here to judge.

1004
01:31:19.827 --> 01:31:21.691
We've all got our reasons.

1005
01:31:26.216 --> 01:31:27.874
Just shoot me.

1006
01:31:31.142 --> 01:31:32.585
You're at your end.

1007
01:31:33.726 --> 01:31:35.082
Make your peace.

1008
01:31:41.586 --> 01:31:42.992
My brother.

1009
01:31:47.977 --> 01:31:49.237
He's all alone.

1010
01:31:54.407 --> 01:31:56.174
I'll make sure you join him.

1011
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:55.956
Those brutes didn't get you.

1012
01:32:58.943 --> 01:33:04.188
Rita, I am so sorry.
- It's fine, Finbar.


1013
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:08.795
You never asked me
what I did for a living.


1014
01:33:10.763 --> 01:33:12.045
Should I have?

1015
01:33:17.416 --> 01:33:20.450
You see... erm... nothing grew.
I should have started it ages ago.


1016
01:33:21.416 --> 01:33:22.416
Oh.

1017
01:33:24.917 --> 01:33:26.582
No, you keep it.

1018
01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:30.307
Maybe somewhere down
the road you'll try again.


1019
01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:40.230
Bye, Rita.

1020
01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:43.772
You eh...
you take care, yeah?
