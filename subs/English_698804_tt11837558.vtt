1
00:00:58.376 --> 00:00:59.878
Oh, Jeff!
Hey.


2
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.145
Uh, yeah.

3
00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:03.748
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.


4
00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:10.322
Oh, there you go.

5
00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:12.390
Ah.

6
00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:14.292
No.

7
00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:16.362
Like, it's Iris,
from Clarissa's party.


8
00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:18.832
Yeah. No, I... Yeah, sorry.
I don't think you're...-


9
00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:20.033
Oh, my God.

10
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.234
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.068
Yeah.
No, it's okay.


12
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:23.470
I thought you were Jeff.
Oh, my God.


13
00:01:23.503 --> 00:01:25.205
Awkward.

14
00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:29.844
And you're walking
this way, too.


15
00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:31.044
Yeah, I know.

16
00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:33.481
- Great.
- I'm Simon.


17
00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:35.248
- Iris.
- Yeah. Got that.


18
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.418
Uh, tell me something
about yourself, Iris.


19
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:41.421
Mmm, okay. Well,

20
00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.424
my sister Agnes
is engaged to


21
00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:47.462
this porn-loving guy
named Justin.


22
00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:51.232
She can't see he's such
a sleaze ball, but I can.


23
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:54.870
But no one ever
listens to me.


24
00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:56.104
I mean, my opinion

25
00:01:56.137 --> 00:01:58.240
doesn't really count much
in my family,


26
00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:01.343
especially when
it comes to my sister.


27
00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:04.179
She's just smarter
and, like, you know,


28
00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:05.113
more serious than me.

29
00:02:05.147 --> 00:02:09.186
And it just makes me feel,
like, stupid,


30
00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:12.388
or almost invisible.

31
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:14.457
Yikes.

32
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.860
That's too much.

33
00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:17.127
No. It...

34
00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.863
- Huh.
- Hmm.


35
00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:22.567
I have these, uh,

36
00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.169
super strict
Mennonite parents.


37
00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:27.004
They don't live
in the city,


38
00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:29.006
but they're, like,
always dropping in


39
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.877
to, like, check in
and see what I'm doing.


40
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.412
Yeah?

41
00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:35.447
Mostly it's just
super embarrassing.


42
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.950
But, like,
it's so clear to me


43
00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:39.150
that they also think

44
00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:42.055
I'm this 10-year-old kid
still.


45
00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:43.524
I don't know.

46
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.897
Hold on.

47
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.531
You want to go grab
a drink?


48
00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.102
Right now?

49
00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:56.471
Yeah.

50
00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:58.606
Uh, yeah.

51
00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:02.309
So, seeing that

52
00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:04.478
I've already overshared
and stuff,


53
00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:07.015
I have a proposal.

54
00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.550
May I?

55
00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.151
- Please. Yep.
- Okay.


56
00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:16.925
I propose we never
see each other again


57
00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.628
after tonight,

58
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.098
so we can say
anything we want.


59
00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:24.266
I don't need to know
your last name.


60
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.302
You don't need to
know mine.


61
00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:27.270
Just reveal
whatever secrets


62
00:03:27.302 --> 00:03:31.509
we want to,
just for tonight,


63
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:35.512
and then
we'll leave it at that.


64
00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:38.482
Uh...

65
00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:39.583
...okay.

66
00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:41.386
Yeah?

67
00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:44.623
Yeah. I'm very nervous
right now. Should I be?


68
00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:47.725
You got a lot of secrets?

69
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.398
Ooh, you do.

70
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.101
- We'll find out. We're going to find out.
- Okay.


71
00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.602
And we're cheers-ing
on it.


72
00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:58.671
Here goes.

73
00:03:58.703 --> 00:03:59.706
That's legally binding.

74
00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.506
Okay.

75
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.709
You first.

76
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.579
I just tell you a secret?

77
00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.983
Yeah. Anything. Random.

78
00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.084
Uh, I have a fear.

79
00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.251
You have a fear?

80
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.989
I have a fear.

81
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:19.461
I'm, um, scared of horses.

82
00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:23.031
Why?

83
00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:26.534
Uh, I don't...
They're for... Okay.


84
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.170
Um, they're...
I don't know.


85
00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.106
- I honestly do not know.
- Is it just the way they look?


86
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.142
- Is it the sound?
- Yes. Their weird looks.


87
00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:36.312
It feels like maybe
they know how you feel.


88
00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:37.412
Maybe. I don't know.

89
00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:38.614
Wow.

90
00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.016
I don't trust them
at all.


91
00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:41.150
I mean, sure.

92
00:04:41.183 --> 00:04:42.352
Fully afraid.

93
00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:44.187
And I wish I had, like,
a cool story


94
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.323
where I was, like, caught in
a horse stampede, but no.


95
00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:47.557
Yeah. You know, like...
Or something like


96
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.792
you were on a horse
and then you fell off.


97
00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:52.028
Not even that.
Never even got on a horse.


98
00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:54.164
Good start.

99
00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:59.670
Uh, I keep
a bullshit journal.


100
00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:04.041
I do this thing where
I have a blank agenda,


101
00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:07.179
plan some dates
and events


102
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:11.282
and trips,
write it in pen,


103
00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:13.085
but I don't actually
do them.


104
00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:16.254
It's just for show.

105
00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:17.623
I kind of like it.

106
00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:19.091
There's something...
There's something to that.


107
00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:21.494
- Interesting.
- Yeah, right.


108
00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:23.163
- Yeah, yeah.
- You'd be, like...


109
00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:25.065
No, no. You got...
There's something.


110
00:05:25.098 --> 00:05:27.467
It's, uh, layers.
I'm, like, scared of horses.


111
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.303
You got a whole...
You got a whole thing.


112
00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:31.304
Weird.

113
00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:34.842
I've only been here for three...
Three years.


114
00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:37.510
- I came from Morden.
- Oh!


115
00:05:37.544 --> 00:05:40.246
- You know it?
- I've never been.


116
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.451
- Oh, my God. You're missing out.
- Am I?


117
00:05:42.483 --> 00:05:43.684
City of dreams, yeah.

118
00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.287
- Wow.
- Yeah.


119
00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:46.420
- Anyways, so I came here.
- Yeah... yeah, came here.


120
00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:48.323
And I didn't know anyone.

121
00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:51.559
The first time I went to
a bar in this city,


122
00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:53.563
I got in a fight.

123
00:05:53.596 --> 00:05:55.098
Wow. You don't...

124
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.599
Not, like, a fight.

125
00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:59.335
Like, I just got, like,
the shit kicked out of me.


126
00:05:59.368 --> 00:06:00.770
Oh, yeah. You don't
strike me as a punchy...


127
00:06:00.803 --> 00:06:02.872
Probably, like, the accurate...
Scrapper, yeah. No.


128
00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.172
Yeah, okay.

129
00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:06.309
And I couldn't stop thinking
about it,


130
00:06:06.343 --> 00:06:07.677
and I kept playing it
over and over in my head.


131
00:06:07.711 --> 00:06:10.681
And then I found the guy,
online.


132
00:06:10.713 --> 00:06:13.816
And, uh,
ever since that happened,


133
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.285
I follow him on Facebook.

134
00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:18.423
And I just constantly
check his page,


135
00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:20.125
because I'm hoping one time
I log in


136
00:06:20.158 --> 00:06:23.461
and something, like, really
horrible has happened to him,


137
00:06:23.493 --> 00:06:26.430
like house burned down,
fell down a flight of stairs.


138
00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:30.768
Anything.
Like, I check it a lot.


139
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.270
That's fucked up.

140
00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.376
I know. I know.

141
00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.314
I was born with...

142
00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:42.815
...a congenital
heart disease.


143
00:06:42.848 --> 00:06:47.653
Like, my heart has
this tiny little hole.


144
00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:52.225
And if they weren't going to
fix it, I was going to die.


145
00:06:52.257 --> 00:06:54.461
My parents
always tell me this,


146
00:06:54.494 --> 00:06:57.931
how they looked at

147
00:06:57.965 --> 00:06:59.599
the entire operation
through a window,


148
00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:04.171
so they've literally

149
00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:05.607
seen my heart.

150
00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:09.511
So, I can't really hide anything
from them.


151
00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:12.446
I, uh...

152
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.485
I never...

153
00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:19.322
...do this.
You know what I mean?


154
00:07:19.354 --> 00:07:22.191
- I can't, uh... I feel like...
- Talk to people?


155
00:07:22.224 --> 00:07:23.926
Well, no. I can talk to people.

156
00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:25.695
I just sort of feel like

157
00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:30.501
I usually...
I never let anyone close.


158
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:31.935
When things get intense,
I walk.


159
00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:34.771
I literally
walk out the door.


160
00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:37.407
So, it's easier
just to wear this mask,


161
00:07:37.441 --> 00:07:39.977
and I can't let
anybody past that,


162
00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.682
'cause then it's just me
after that, and I don't know.


163
00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:48.453
I don't want to give that
to anyone.


164
00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:51.255
Hmm.

165
00:07:51.288 --> 00:07:54.359
I always wished that
I was that girl,


166
00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:57.929
the one that makes
the wild choices.


167
00:07:57.962 --> 00:08:01.833
Like, I've only ever had
one guy


168
00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:02.968
that I slept with,

169
00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:06.906
and that was
a while ago.


170
00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:10.009
I don't feel like

171
00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:13.013
anyone
could want me.


172
00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:17.951
Like, I'm just
this unlovable girl.


173
00:08:17.984 --> 00:08:22.256
You seem like the opposite
of unlovable.


174
00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:29.765
Well...

175
00:08:32.733 --> 00:08:35.403
...it's getting late.
I got to go.


176
00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:39.008
Oh, seriously?

177
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.511
Thanks for the...

178
00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:42.978
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

179
00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:46.282
Okay. Yeah.

180
00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:52.589
Bye-bye.

181
00:09:01.098 --> 00:09:03.835
You ever been in
a three-way?


182
00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:07.639
No.

183
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.474
You want to?

184
00:09:09.506 --> 00:09:11.042
Uh, with you?

185
00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:12.745
Well, yeah, probably.

186
00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:17.750
So, this dude,
he's talking to me, right?


187
00:09:17.783 --> 00:09:19.752
He's asking me all these
questions, and then he's, like,


188
00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:21.453
"How would you like to make
a thousand dollars


189
00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:23.923
"to be in a porno?
And if you bring your friend,


190
00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:27.327
he can make
a thousand dollars, too."


191
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.396
You want to do
a porno?


192
00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:31.864
You want me to be in a porno,
with you?


193
00:09:31.897 --> 00:09:34.401
Why not? Yeah.

194
00:09:34.434 --> 00:09:35.468
What?
It's not weird.


195
00:09:35.502 --> 00:09:36.904
- It is weird.
- It's not weird.


196
00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:37.904
Yeah. It's ridiculously weird.

197
00:09:37.938 --> 00:09:40.341
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.


198
00:09:40.373 --> 00:09:41.608
Look.

199
00:09:41.642 --> 00:09:42.810
You don't
have to look at it.


200
00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:44.445
You don't have to look at it.

201
00:09:44.479 --> 00:09:45.647
I won't look at yours.

202
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.881
You won't have to
look at mine.


203
00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:48.849
- We don't got to make eye contact.
- You will look at mine.


204
00:09:48.882 --> 00:09:50.084
I might just. Why?

205
00:09:50.118 --> 00:09:52.786
- No.
- Why not?


206
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.457
It's insane to me that I would
have to explain that to you.


207
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.059
Well...

208
00:09:58.093 --> 00:09:59.862
Well, it's not like
you ain't having sex.


209
00:09:59.894 --> 00:10:00.929
Now you're just
getting paid for it.


210
00:10:00.962 --> 00:10:02.931
Ugh.

211
00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:05.568
What? What's up?

212
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:07.136
Nothing.

213
00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:10.439
What? Come on.
Fuck that. What's up?


214
00:10:10.472 --> 00:10:12.808
You and I,
we know each other.


215
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:14.711
We can be ourselves.

216
00:10:14.744 --> 00:10:16.880
You can ask me to be
in a porno for some reason.


217
00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:18.616
But you know,
you meet someone new


218
00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:21.519
and, uh, you can't.

219
00:10:21.552 --> 00:10:24.688
You have to say certain things
and be a certain way,


220
00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:28.592
and if you take it
too far too soon, then...


221
00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:30.161
You know, but
it's all in the service


222
00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:31.396
of getting to know them,

223
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.497
so I don't see
why you can't...


224
00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.733
No, no. We going to talk
about, what, Margaret again?


225
00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:36.101
We're going to
talk about...


226
00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:38.002
Margaret? What?
Iris. Iris.


227
00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:39.438
Iris. Yo, yo.

228
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:42.509
Okay. We're going to
talk about Iris again.


229
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.176
No, I'm not.
What do you mean, "again"?


230
00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:45.512
No, no, no.
Keep going.


231
00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:46.580
This is
very interesting.


232
00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:48.547
- Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting you?
- No, no, no.


233
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.715
Are you working
right now or what?


234
00:10:49.748 --> 00:10:50.849
I come to you,
telling you


235
00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:51.950
about my fucking great
porno idea,


236
00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.954
and you're over here talking
about some random woman


237
00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.121
you ain't going to
never talk to again.


238
00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.589
No. It's not...

239
00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:58.492
It felt like there was
something there,


240
00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:01.861
which I don't feel like happens
every time I meet someone.


241
00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:03.463
- You know what I mean?
- Sure.


242
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:07.835
And I didn't get her last name
and, uh, now she's gone.


243
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:13.875
So, that's pretty classic me.

244
00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:15.911
You could try to, uh,
stop bitching for a bit.


245
00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:17.179
Have you
thought about that?


246
00:11:17.212 --> 00:11:19.848
Did you try,
uh, not complaining?


247
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:21.049
How did that go
for you?


248
00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:23.218
You good? Like, because
I wouldn't want you


249
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.620
to accidentally start working...

250
00:11:24.653 --> 00:11:28.057
...someone helping out
with this shit.


251
00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:30.693
It doesn't matter, ultimately.
That's what I'm saying.


252
00:11:30.727 --> 00:11:31.995
Because even if
I found her, you know,


253
00:11:32.027 --> 00:11:35.531
we did this weird
oversharing thing...


254
00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:37.800
You got to stop this.

255
00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:40.905
You got to beating up on
yourself like this, okay?


256
00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:43.474
'Cause you are handsome
and funny.


257
00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:47.144
- You got really pretty eyes.
- All right.


258
00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:48.513
You are good at

259
00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:50.915
whatever the fuck
you're doing over there.


260
00:11:50.947 --> 00:11:52.015
Come do a porno with me,
all right?


261
00:11:52.048 --> 00:11:53.150
We would be
so good at it!


262
00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:55.119
I am not. I can't believe
that's where that was going.


263
00:11:55.153 --> 00:11:57.223
- We would be so good!
- It's not going to happen.


264
00:11:57.255 --> 00:11:58.423
Oh, no, no, no.

265
00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:03.128
I'm not... Why am I hearing
the sound of yimmer-yammering


266
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:05.265
when I'm supposed to be hearing
the sound of hammering?


267
00:12:05.298 --> 00:12:08.067
I don't understand.
I just don't get it.


268
00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:09.702
Gentlemen,

269
00:12:09.736 --> 00:12:14.140
you got to let me help you
so you can help me.


270
00:12:14.173 --> 00:12:15.909
All right? What have I told you
guys about talking on the job?


271
00:12:15.942 --> 00:12:17.245
Not to, all right?

272
00:12:17.277 --> 00:12:20.013
Three reasons: number one,
I'm losing money.


273
00:12:20.046 --> 00:12:22.115
Number two,
you're losing money.


274
00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:23.650
And number three,
the powers that be...


275
00:12:25.218 --> 00:12:26.186
They're sucking the information

276
00:12:26.219 --> 00:12:27.821
right out of your brain
when you're not focused.


277
00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:29.091
You think I'm joking?
Check your phone.


278
00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:31.627
Every time you go on that phone,
they're vacuuming your brain.


279
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.594
So, I need you to be focused.
Okay, guys?


280
00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:35.097
- Yep.
- You got that?


281
00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.698
- Yep.
- Hey, Simon?


282
00:12:37.732 --> 00:12:39.901
You missed a spot.
You? Keep stirring paint.


283
00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:42.638
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.574
- What are you looking at?
- Well, it's break time, man.


285
00:12:44.607 --> 00:12:45.642
Yeah.

286
00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:47.777
- It's time to...
- No, no. You fail to understand.


287
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.279
I came over here
to break your balls


288
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:50.613
because
you weren't working.


289
00:12:50.646 --> 00:12:52.649
So, break time?
I don't think so.


290
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:56.687
♪ Sparks began ♪

291
00:13:06.297 --> 00:13:08.332
The last thing is
giveaways and door prizes.


292
00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:10.769
And that will be
all in the wedding party


293
00:13:10.802 --> 00:13:13.605
and the... I don't know.
The niñas and niños.


294
00:13:15.707 --> 00:13:16.809
Iris, Iris?

295
00:13:16.842 --> 00:13:17.910
Iris?

296
00:13:17.943 --> 00:13:18.910
Hello?

297
00:13:18.944 --> 00:13:21.613
Come here, Iris.

298
00:13:21.646 --> 00:13:23.148
Can you figure out

299
00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:25.984
if your work can do
a social donation?


300
00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:33.827
...budget plans.
So, come over.


301
00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:38.298
No, she's too...
Dad, she's too busy.


302
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.267
She's thinking about Stanley.

303
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.302
Stanley?

304
00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:43.370
I mean, Steven. I mean...

305
00:13:43.403 --> 00:13:44.638
What?

306
00:13:44.672 --> 00:13:45.840
It's Simon!

307
00:13:45.873 --> 00:13:47.809
Right. I was right.
Simon. It's Simon, Mom.


308
00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:49.676
It's Simon and I'm never going
to see him again, okay?


309
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.112
Simon and she's probably
going to see him again.


310
00:13:54.982 --> 00:13:57.051
No, no, no, Ma.

311
00:13:57.085 --> 00:14:00.355
We just had a drink that one
time and that's it, okay?


312
00:14:05.962 --> 00:14:09.832
Fine. Okay, okay, okay.
What do you want me to do?


313
00:14:09.866 --> 00:14:11.034
You can handle
the budget.


314
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.636
Tell me.

315
00:14:14.904 --> 00:14:16.039
Nurse?

316
00:14:18.007 --> 00:14:19.743
...music... boyfriend...

317
00:14:21.245 --> 00:14:22.380
No, I don't think so.

318
00:14:22.412 --> 00:14:23.780
Okay.

319
00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:25.016
Just give me the list
and I'll do it.


320
00:14:25.049 --> 00:14:26.350
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

321
00:14:26.382 --> 00:14:28.919
No, no. I'll do it.
I have my own stuff at work.


322
00:14:28.953 --> 00:14:31.390
Okay, Ma? I'll do it.
I won't mess it up.


323
00:14:31.422 --> 00:14:33.357
Do you promise?

324
00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:34.926
Yep. I promise.

325
00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:38.363
You're going to do it...

326
00:14:38.396 --> 00:14:39.798
Give her a chance.

327
00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:43.201
Yes, ma.
Simon says give her a chance.


328
00:14:43.234 --> 00:14:45.805
Simon?

329
00:14:48.407 --> 00:14:49.776
No.

330
00:14:49.808 --> 00:14:51.143
Is that what you want?

331
00:14:51.177 --> 00:14:53.080
No. We are not letting Simon
touch this.


332
00:14:53.112 --> 00:14:54.147
You are going to do the budget.

333
00:14:54.181 --> 00:14:55.382
I will not
see him again, okay?


334
00:14:55.414 --> 00:14:56.783
So, I will fix this.

335
00:14:58.051 --> 00:15:00.086
I don't want you to make
the same mistake.


336
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.721
- I'm telling you.
- I won't.


337
00:15:03.255 --> 00:15:05.827
Oh. It's Justin.

338
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.762
- Can you get it, please?
- Thank you.


339
00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:11.699
Oh. Justin.

340
00:15:11.732 --> 00:15:12.900
Hey.

341
00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:14.068
- Hey.
- Hi, hon.


342
00:15:14.102 --> 00:15:15.270
Hey, hey.
Sorry I'm late.


343
00:15:15.303 --> 00:15:16.706
Hope you guys didn't get
too far without me.


344
00:15:16.738 --> 00:15:17.706
No. Did the car start?

345
00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:18.873
It did, eventually.

346
00:15:18.906 --> 00:15:19.908
Good.

347
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:20.775
Good. You're here.

348
00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:22.210
Yeah, thanks.
It's good to see you.


349
00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:23.311
Hi.

350
00:15:23.344 --> 00:15:25.314
How far did you get?
Did you get to the budget yet?


351
00:15:25.347 --> 00:15:28.184
Um, Iris is going to do
the budget.


352
00:15:28.217 --> 00:15:29.286
Cool. Well, maybe
we could do it together,


353
00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:30.187
'cause I was
kind of hoping


354
00:15:30.219 --> 00:15:31.488
I could actually have
a hand in that.


355
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:34.424
- Oh, that's good. Yeah. Great idea.
- Yes, yes. Do it together.


356
00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:37.727
Okay. Maybe you could
just, like, meet and stuff?


357
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:39.830
- Hi. How are you?
- It'll be easier that way.


358
00:15:39.863 --> 00:15:41.165
- Good to see you again.
- You, too.


359
00:15:41.197 --> 00:15:42.365
- Okay.
- Hi.


360
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:46.871
- Oh, okay.
- Go ahead.


361
00:15:46.903 --> 00:15:48.739
- Yeah, I do.
- Where are you going?


362
00:15:48.773 --> 00:15:50.273
I'm going to go get some food.
Is that okay?


363
00:15:50.307 --> 00:15:51.842
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's fine.


364
00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:53.511
- You'll be okay here?
- I'm fine.


365
00:15:53.544 --> 00:15:55.847
- Okay. Iris, can you drive?
- Take care.


366
00:16:03.288 --> 00:16:04.958
I'm going to get you
to grab me


367
00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:07.025
some barbecued chicken,
spicy.


368
00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:08.828
And, uh, I don't need
nothing to drink.


369
00:16:08.861 --> 00:16:10.496
Just come in
and get it yourself.


370
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.997
No, no, no.
I'm got to go park the car.


371
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.500
We have, like,

372
00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:16.136
Exactly. So, if you could get
the food, that'd be awesome.


373
00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:18.872
You're just going to
sit here and smoke?


374
00:16:18.906 --> 00:16:20.340
No, I'm not just going to
sit here and smoke, okay?


375
00:16:20.373 --> 00:16:22.409
Come on. Hurry up.

376
00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:34.955
Okay.
So, I'm going to get the number seven,


377
00:16:34.988 --> 00:16:36.258
the barbecued pork sandwich,
and...


378
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:38.960
Iris?

379
00:16:38.993 --> 00:16:41.430
And what do you want,
a number 11?


380
00:16:41.462 --> 00:16:42.831
I don't know.
Is that what you want?


381
00:16:42.864 --> 00:16:43.899
Yeah.

382
00:16:43.932 --> 00:16:45.934
Are you sure?

383
00:16:45.967 --> 00:16:48.103
Iris, what do you want?

384
00:16:48.137 --> 00:16:49.505
Just pick one.

385
00:16:49.538 --> 00:16:50.907
- Hi.
- Hi.


386
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.512
This is...

387
00:16:56.111 --> 00:16:57.481
Well, what are you
doing here?


388
00:16:57.514 --> 00:16:59.483
Uh, I'm just on a break,
actually, from work.


389
00:16:59.515 --> 00:17:01.284
I need to get back. But, uh...

390
00:17:01.317 --> 00:17:03.220
That's so funny.

391
00:17:03.253 --> 00:17:04.588
Yeah. We probably should've
known this was going to happen.


392
00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:07.592
Ah, it's Winnipeg,
right?


393
00:17:07.624 --> 00:17:09.160
Winnipeg, yeah.

394
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.196
Yeah.
You were literally...


395
00:17:12.229 --> 00:17:14.531
Yeah. I was just literally
thinking about the other night.


396
00:17:14.564 --> 00:17:15.833
So, that was...

397
00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:17.036
Oh, crazy. Yeah.

398
00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:20.171
Yeah. Me, too. I was,
uh, thinking about you.


399
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:23.275
Uh,

400
00:17:23.307 --> 00:17:26.144
do you, uh...

401
00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:27.345
Can I give you
my number?


402
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.316
Just if, like...

403
00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.518
- I mean...
- Or should we, like...


404
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.452
I don't know.

405
00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.422
Did we go too far?
I would get it.


406
00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:39.459
'Cause we did. We put...
I put a lot out there,


407
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.428
and if I heard all that
from someone


408
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:43.597
- maybe I would not like them.
- No, no, no.


409
00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:45.600
I would understand
if you hate me.


410
00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:47.535
I'm very hateable.
It's my superpower.


411
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.369
No. I mean, we're here now,

412
00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.605
so I guess
it cancels it out.


413
00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:52.005
So...

414
00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:54.242
Okay, yeah. No.

415
00:17:54.276 --> 00:17:55.443
Yeah? Okay.

416
00:17:55.477 --> 00:17:57.145
Yes. I would...
That would be...


417
00:17:57.177 --> 00:17:58.512
- That's a...
- Here.


418
00:17:58.546 --> 00:18:00.949
So, you can just, like, call me,
and then...


419
00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:03.285
Cool.

420
00:18:03.318 --> 00:18:05.187
I think it'll ring

421
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:08.458
in three, two...

422
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:10.926
There you go.

423
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.662
Yep. There it is.

424
00:18:12.694 --> 00:18:14.030
- Hello?
- Hi.


425
00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:16.666
- Yeah.
- It's good.


426
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.036
- Well?
- It's working.


427
00:18:19.069 --> 00:18:21.472
I guess I'll talk to you
in a bit.


428
00:18:21.504 --> 00:18:24.241
Yeah. Whenever, or never, or...
Yeah, sure.


429
00:18:24.273 --> 00:18:26.609
- Okay.
- Great.


430
00:18:46.064 --> 00:18:47.365
Oh, I knew it!

431
00:18:47.399 --> 00:18:49.068
What?
It's legal now.


432
00:19:48.132 --> 00:19:50.067
- Hi.
- Hey.


433

- Come on in.
- Thanks.


434

- How you doing?
- Good.

00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:17.328
Yeah.

474
00:21:17.362 --> 00:21:18.397
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


475
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.431
Oh.

476
00:21:20.632 --> 00:21:22.767
♪ Find me where to work,
it's all work and no Play-Doh ♪


477
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.769
Well, don't stop here. I have
an entire apartment of things


478
00:21:24.803 --> 00:21:26.805
just waiting
to be judged by you.


479
00:21:26.837 --> 00:21:28.339
Okay. Let's see.

480
00:21:28.374 --> 00:21:29.776
You've got some more tapes,

481
00:21:29.808 --> 00:21:33.645
CDs and this thing.

482
00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:34.681
What is this thing?

483
00:21:34.713 --> 00:21:35.781
It looks like it's
about to fall.


484
00:21:35.815 --> 00:21:39.786
That thing is
a weird bowl, obviously.


485
00:21:39.818 --> 00:21:42.655
And it's intentionally
placed that way


486
00:21:42.689 --> 00:21:44.825
so that when the world
tilts out of balance


487
00:21:44.857 --> 00:21:47.727
I will have
advance warning.


488
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.865
Obviously.

489
00:21:50.897 --> 00:21:52.333
Is that yours?

490
00:21:52.366 --> 00:21:53.702
Yeah.

491
00:21:53.734 --> 00:21:57.671
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
It's real.


492
00:21:57.704 --> 00:22:00.541
Yeah, yeah. I know.
It's not just a prop.


493
00:22:00.575 --> 00:22:01.742
Whoa.

494
00:22:01.776 --> 00:22:03.411
Can I?

495
00:22:03.443 --> 00:22:05.548
First time in the apartment.
Just straight to the bass, huh?


496
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.748
I don't know
a lot of people


497
00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:08.350
that have
their own upright bass.


498
00:22:08.384 --> 00:22:09.618
Fair enough.

499
00:22:09.652 --> 00:22:11.287
Do you play it?

500
00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:13.822
I play, like, uh,
two notes pretty well.


501
00:22:13.856 --> 00:22:15.424
That's pretty good.
Let's hear it.


502
00:22:15.456 --> 00:22:16.692
Oh, yeah. No, no.

503
00:22:16.725 --> 00:22:19.695
Not, like, on request
or anything like that.


504
00:22:19.728 --> 00:22:22.465
It's not
a solo instrument.


505
00:22:22.499 --> 00:22:25.836
You play the bass with
other people and it, uh,


506
00:22:25.868 --> 00:22:29.806
connects you in a deeper,
almost spiritual way.


507
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.208
Sort of, like, uh...

508
00:22:31.242 --> 00:22:32.243
Two notes.

509
00:22:32.275 --> 00:22:33.577
What? Do you play?

510
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.679
I'm a singer, yeah.

511
00:22:35.713 --> 00:22:37.447
I play guitar,
but I don't play bass.


512
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:38.917
- Really?
- Yeah.


513
00:22:38.949 --> 00:22:40.351
I've always wanted to,
you know,


514
00:22:40.384 --> 00:22:41.585
play shows on my own,
and...


515
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.656
Well, then, I am definitely not
playing this thing for you.


516
00:22:43.688 --> 00:22:46.492
- Oh, come on. Two notes. That's pretty good.
- Two notes, yeah.


517
00:22:46.524 --> 00:22:48.226
When I'm at, like,

518
00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:49.961
then I'm going to leave you
with your own personal solo.


519
00:22:49.995 --> 00:22:51.764
No, but...

520
00:22:51.796 --> 00:22:53.599
But no, no, I can't.
I can't. I can't.


521
00:22:53.632 --> 00:22:55.568
Come on.
It's two notes.


522
00:22:55.602 --> 00:22:57.504
Do you hear that?

523
00:22:57.536 --> 00:22:59.506
Snowplow.

524
00:22:59.538 --> 00:23:01.775
Let's go.

525
00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:08.281
Oh, there he is.

526
00:23:08.315 --> 00:23:09.784
There he is.

527
00:23:09.816 --> 00:23:12.620
You got to watch this, 'cause
what I love about this guy


528
00:23:12.652 --> 00:23:13.754
is that some guys
are just clearing snow,


529
00:23:13.787 --> 00:23:16.290
but you can tell that
this guy loves what he's doing.


530
00:23:16.324 --> 00:23:18.227
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah, okay.


531
00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:19.228
- Hold on.
- What?


532
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.928
Well, he's going to do,
like, a 360 little move.


533
00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:21.963
Just watch.

534
00:23:24.531 --> 00:23:27.735
Yeah. Artistry.

535
00:23:52.797 --> 00:23:54.866
Ooh.

536
00:23:54.898 --> 00:23:58.936
Just so you know, we're
not having sex tonight.


537
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:02.506
Which means that we are
on another night?


538
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.881
But you didn't?

539
00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:09.949
Yeah, but we will.

540
00:24:09.982 --> 00:24:12.350
When?

541
00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:13.319
Yeah. I don't know.

542
00:24:13.351 --> 00:24:15.887
Like, at some point
in the future, I guess.


543
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.425
But, like, I can't believe how
good it is when we're together.


544
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.359
Like, she's just so playful...

545
00:24:20.394 --> 00:24:21.995
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Totally get it. Come on.


546
00:24:22.028 --> 00:24:23.730
...and just so willing
to jump into stuff,


547
00:24:23.763 --> 00:24:25.299
and we just, like, absolutely...

548
00:24:25.331 --> 00:24:27.900
Look. Your story
is amazing. Seriously.


549
00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:29.837
I'm so enthralled by it.
But right now, save my life.


550
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.540
Yeah, okay.

551
00:24:32.572 --> 00:24:34.876
Oof. Okay. All right.
That was okay.


552
00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:36.678
That was close.
Maybe a little lower.


553
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.348
Yeah. All right.
Again?


554
00:24:40.381 --> 00:24:44.018
It's just, like, I have not been
in this situation before


555
00:24:44.052 --> 00:24:48.490
where I don't know what
she really wants, ultimately.


556
00:24:48.523 --> 00:24:51.060
And it's just... I wouldn't
blame her if she thinks...


557
00:24:51.092 --> 00:24:54.497
Shh, shh. Look at me.
Look at me.


558
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:57.866
You're beautiful.
You're what every man wants.


559
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.905
Now give me
the Heimlich, okay?


560
00:25:01.938 --> 00:25:03.172
And... Oof. Okay.
I deserved that.


561
00:25:03.206 --> 00:25:06.510
Yeah. I'm just going to break
a rib or something like that.


562
00:25:06.543 --> 00:25:08.512
Show me how it's done,
and then...


563
00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:11.481
All right. Ready?

564
00:25:11.515 --> 00:25:13.551
I guess, yeah.

565
00:25:18.155 --> 00:25:22.661
Ooh!
I can't tell if that's working.


566
00:25:22.693 --> 00:25:25.730
I need it to work,
all right?


567
00:25:25.764 --> 00:25:27.799
What happened?

568
00:25:27.832 --> 00:25:29.634
I went to the porno
the other day, right?


569
00:25:29.667 --> 00:25:31.770
Oh, my God. You actually
went through with it?


570
00:25:31.804 --> 00:25:34.574
- I went through with it.
- What was it like?


571
00:25:34.606 --> 00:25:36.509
It was weird.
It was weird as fuck, man.


572
00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:38.577
You...

573
00:25:38.611 --> 00:25:39.979
And what'd they
make you do?


574
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:42.549
I don't want to talk about
the porn, man.


575
00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:43.684
What I want to talk to you
about is


576
00:25:43.716 --> 00:25:45.151
I go to
the craft services table, right?


577
00:25:45.184 --> 00:25:46.819
I'm just eating some food,
and this dude comes next to me


578
00:25:46.853 --> 00:25:49.156
and he starts
fucking choking, man.


579
00:25:49.189 --> 00:25:51.458
He chokes
and he falls to the ground


580
00:25:51.491 --> 00:25:54.529
and I'm sitting there
looking at him, and I just...


581
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.562
I froze.

582
00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:56.731
Right.

583
00:25:56.763 --> 00:25:57.931
And that
could have been you.


584
00:25:57.964 --> 00:25:59.000
That could've been you
sitting there.


585
00:25:59.032 --> 00:26:01.101
And you're choking and
I'm sitting there freezing,


586
00:26:01.135 --> 00:26:04.407
and what if
nobody comes, right?


587
00:26:04.439 --> 00:26:06.508
So, what?
He just kept choking?


588
00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:08.610
No, man. Someone came
and saved him eventually.


589
00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:10.746
It just wasn't me,
right? And I just...


590
00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:13.782
I don't want to be
the guy


591
00:26:13.816 --> 00:26:15.751
that's remembered
for standing next to


592
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.888
the person who died,
you know?


593
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.121
Okay. I don't think
I'm going to choke, man.


594
00:26:19.155 --> 00:26:20.523
This isn't a porno set.

595
00:26:20.556 --> 00:26:21.991
Just trust me.

596
00:26:22.024 --> 00:26:23.692
- Oh! We're not doing that again.
- You okay?


597
00:26:23.725 --> 00:26:24.761
Okay.
Well, come to...


598
00:26:24.793 --> 00:26:25.895
Let's take a class.
You and me.


599
00:26:25.928 --> 00:26:27.096
I'm not going to do that.
It's not going to happen.


600
00:26:27.129 --> 00:26:29.867
What if I'm the one? What if
I'm sitting on the floor, huh?


601
00:26:29.899 --> 00:26:31.402
Well, I'm never going to be
on the porno s...


602
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:35.540
- Hey.
- Hey.


603
00:26:35.572 --> 00:26:36.974
Yeah.
Sorry I'm late.


604
00:26:37.006 --> 00:26:39.043
Just got a little bit
of time, break from work.


605
00:26:39.075 --> 00:26:40.144
Yeah? Cool.

606
00:26:40.178 --> 00:26:41.679
Uh, what do you got
so far?


607
00:26:41.712 --> 00:26:44.782
I'm just looking at how much
the hall actually costs.


608
00:26:44.815 --> 00:26:46.884
Which? Which one?

609
00:26:46.918 --> 00:26:49.121
Petrus. I think
Agnes mentioned that...


610
00:26:49.153 --> 00:26:50.221
Yeah.
That was one of them.


611
00:26:50.255 --> 00:26:51.590
There was a few others,
too, though.


612
00:26:51.622 --> 00:26:52.624
But have you done
anything, like...


613
00:26:52.658 --> 00:26:53.927
Uh, yeah.

614
00:26:53.959 --> 00:26:55.228
...planning-for-the-budget
wise?


615
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.897
Mmm, yes. I did create,
like, a chart.


616
00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.867
Okay. I'm just going to
come over there.


617
00:27:01.901 --> 00:27:05.840
Okay. Uh, what's this?

618
00:27:05.873 --> 00:27:07.807
Agnes left you a folder just so
you have something to look over.


619
00:27:07.841 --> 00:27:10.578
Oh, okay. Great.
Cool.


620
00:27:10.611 --> 00:27:12.746
And, uh, is this
the same thing here?


621
00:27:12.778 --> 00:27:14.248
Yep, should be about the same.

622
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.915
Okay, okay.

623
00:27:15.949 --> 00:27:19.754
So, uh, tell me about this
Petrus Hall, I guess.


624
00:27:19.787 --> 00:27:20.956
Yeah.
It's really huge.


625
00:27:20.989 --> 00:27:22.156
Have you,
besides this,


626
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.057
have you, like,
looked at anything?


627
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.925
Is there anything else
that we've, like...


628
00:27:24.959 --> 00:27:26.528
Well, I tried to look at
other stuff,


629
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.895
but this is the hall
that she really wants to use.


630
00:27:27.929 --> 00:27:29.231
Okay. Here. I'm just
going to grab this.


631
00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:35.671
Okay. And you have
the DJ filled out already?


632
00:27:35.703 --> 00:27:37.973
Oh, yeah. I talked to a friend,
and I'm pretty sure


633
00:27:38.007 --> 00:27:39.976
I can get him for $500,
so I just put it in there.


634
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.112
- You're pretty sure?
- Yeah, pretty sure.


635
00:27:42.145 --> 00:27:43.780
Okay. Well, if we go with
a DJ, that's good to know.


636
00:27:43.812 --> 00:27:45.781
I really appreciate that.
That's awesome.


637
00:27:45.815 --> 00:27:47.551
Oh, well, thanks.

638
00:27:47.584 --> 00:27:50.953
Uh, can I just say something?

639
00:27:50.986 --> 00:27:53.090
I really feel
uncomfortable


640
00:27:53.124 --> 00:27:56.828
when you get really close
and start to touch me.


641
00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.063
Uh, I'm sorry.

642
00:28:00.097 --> 00:28:01.799
I didn't mean
anything by it.


643
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:02.900
I'm just being friendly.
I'm sorry.


644
00:28:02.934 --> 00:28:03.968
Oh, okay.

645
00:28:04.002 --> 00:28:05.303
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine.

646
00:28:05.337 --> 00:28:07.106
- No, no. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
- Yeah. Sorry.


647
00:28:07.138 --> 00:28:08.240
I'm just, like, you're going to
be my sister-in-law.


648
00:28:08.272 --> 00:28:09.675
I just, you know...
Sorry. I just...


649
00:28:09.707 --> 00:28:10.842
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sorry.

650
00:28:10.876 --> 00:28:12.144
No, no. It's all good.
It's all good.


651
00:28:12.176 --> 00:28:14.647
- Um, really appreciate the DJ.
- Yeah.


652
00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:16.549
That's gonna be awesome. If you
could contact Petrus Hall,


653
00:28:16.582 --> 00:28:17.783
I gotta get back to work.

654
00:28:17.816 --> 00:28:19.218
- So, is that cool?
- Yep.


655
00:28:19.252 --> 00:28:21.021
Great. Awesome.
Thank you so much.


656
00:28:27.726 --> 00:28:30.230
The theme of the social
is going to be Hollywood.


657
00:28:30.264 --> 00:28:32.934
Ooh, Hollywood? Woo!

658
00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:35.669
Yeah, like red carpet.

659
00:28:35.703 --> 00:28:38.806
Justin's friends
want to do live karaoke.


660
00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:39.740
They suggested that.

661
00:28:39.774 --> 00:28:42.611
Oh, no, no, no, Papa.
There you go again.


662
00:28:42.643 --> 00:28:45.146
No.
You can't just do that.


663
00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:47.248
No, Mom.
You should hear Justin sing.


664
00:28:48.882 --> 00:28:51.687
Yeah. His voice is so...
It's so honest.


665
00:28:51.719 --> 00:28:52.788
Ugh.

666
00:28:52.822 --> 00:28:54.724
Iris...

667
00:28:57.692 --> 00:28:58.760
What's your problem?

668
00:28:58.794 --> 00:28:59.929
Something's wrong?

669
00:28:59.961 --> 00:29:01.797
Oh, no, no. Sorry.

670
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:03.800
Oh, no, no. I heard you.

671
00:29:05.102 --> 00:29:06.903
Nothing, nothing.
I'm sorry.


672
00:29:06.937 --> 00:29:08.072
I just... I got to go.

673
00:29:08.104 --> 00:29:10.374
Uh, you know,
Iris,


674
00:29:10.406 --> 00:29:12.710
we're busy here, okay?

675
00:29:14.978 --> 00:29:15.778
I just heard you.

676
00:29:15.812 --> 00:29:17.649
What's that?

677
00:29:19.182 --> 00:29:20.884
Nothing.

678
00:29:20.917 --> 00:29:22.086
You never help us here.

679
00:29:25.088 --> 00:29:27.325
But something's wrong.

680
00:29:34.433 --> 00:29:35.768
Here, Mom.

681
00:29:37.869 --> 00:29:39.871
Iris...

682
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:45.846
See? We're so busy here
talking about...


683
00:29:47.446 --> 00:29:49.148
but you still have
this attitude.


684
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.920
Speak up.

685
00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:55.089
Speak up.

686
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:56.657
It's nothing, Ma.
It's nothing. Sorry.


687
00:29:56.691 --> 00:29:59.060
Sorry.
I just have to be somewhere.


688
00:29:59.092 --> 00:30:00.293
I'm sorry.

689
00:30:00.327 --> 00:30:01.796
No. We are talking
about your...


690
00:30:01.829 --> 00:30:04.000
Iris!

691
00:30:07.369 --> 00:30:09.138
Why do you always
have to be like this?


692
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.873
Me? You should ask Mom
why she's always such a bitch.


693
00:30:11.907 --> 00:30:14.176
Oh, so you
throwing all the attitude


694
00:30:14.208 --> 00:30:16.145
wasn't you
being a bitch?


695
00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:18.715
She's always picking on me.
It's always me, right?


696
00:30:18.747 --> 00:30:21.051
Yeah, because you're
the one with the problem.


697
00:30:21.083 --> 00:30:23.820
I do not have a problem,
for fuck's sake.


698
00:30:23.852 --> 00:30:26.689
What is wrong?

699
00:30:26.723 --> 00:30:29.092
Does it ever
fucking bother you


700
00:30:29.125 --> 00:30:33.363
how Justin is so touchy
with every girl he meets?


701
00:30:33.397 --> 00:30:34.832
No.

702
00:30:34.864 --> 00:30:36.766
That's just him.

703
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.704
Of course.

704
00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:44.910
Iris, you know, just because
you had a failed relationship


705
00:30:44.942 --> 00:30:46.744
doesn't mean you have to
take it out on mine.


706
00:30:46.777 --> 00:30:48.180
We're all happy here,

707
00:30:48.212 --> 00:30:49.346
and you're the only one
that's upset


708
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.149
that all of this
is happening.


709
00:30:51.181 --> 00:30:52.884
You know what?
Forget it.


710
00:30:52.918 --> 00:30:56.156
Thanks a lot,
Agnes.


711
00:31:10.804 --> 00:31:14.341
Somewhere right around here.

712
00:31:14.374 --> 00:31:16.211
So, in such a way
that the angle is


713
00:31:16.243 --> 00:31:20.981
sort of like right into
there, the corner pocket.


714
00:31:21.015 --> 00:31:25.320
So, you kind of back it up
and, uh...


715
00:31:25.353 --> 00:31:27.756
Iris.

716
00:31:30.091 --> 00:31:31.926
What are you doing?

717
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.863
What did you tell Agnes

718
00:31:33.895 --> 00:31:36.030
about what happened
the other day?


719
00:31:36.064 --> 00:31:38.167
- What do you mean?
- What did you tell her?


720
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.372
I just told her how I didn't
feel comfortable about,


721
00:31:42.405 --> 00:31:44.774
well,
how close you get...


722
00:31:44.808 --> 00:31:46.143
Okay, but did you
tell her about


723
00:31:46.175 --> 00:31:47.444
how we were
cool afterwards?


724
00:31:47.476 --> 00:31:48.778
How it was
a misunderstanding?


725
00:31:48.811 --> 00:31:50.914
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?


726
00:31:50.946 --> 00:31:53.050
Because that's
how we left things,


727
00:31:53.082 --> 00:31:57.120
and then you tell her that
I was being inappropriate?


728
00:31:57.154 --> 00:32:00.157
I didn't... She told me
it was... Like, she understood.


729
00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:02.126
Like, I thought that
I just left it off that way.


730
00:32:02.158 --> 00:32:03.829
I didn't think it was
such a big deal.


731
00:32:03.861 --> 00:32:04.897
No. It's apparently
a bigger deal


732
00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:05.997
than you thought
it was.


733
00:32:06.031 --> 00:32:07.265
She said it was fine.

734
00:32:07.299 --> 00:32:09.835
I don't know if that's actually
what you told her or not, okay?


735
00:32:09.868 --> 00:32:12.236
No. I told her exactly
what I thought.


736
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.006
- That we had...
- I didn't exactly have...


737
00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:16.042
- Hey.
- Hey.


738
00:32:16.074 --> 00:32:18.378
What's up?

739
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:19.813
Oh, yeah. This is Justin,
my brother-in-law.


740
00:32:19.845 --> 00:32:20.979
- Hey.
- Simon.


741
00:32:21.013 --> 00:32:22.381
Brother-in-law.

742
00:32:22.415 --> 00:32:24.117
Hey.

743
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:25.985
He's my boyfriend.

744
00:32:26.017 --> 00:32:27.553
Cool.

745
00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:29.122
Good to meet you.

746
00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:30.991
Yeah. Good to meet you,
too.


747
00:32:31.024 --> 00:32:34.227
Well, uh,

748
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.595
don't let me interrupt.

749
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:38.498
Um, cool.

750
00:32:38.532 --> 00:32:40.536
Yeah. Thanks.

751
00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:47.608
You okay?

752
00:32:47.642 --> 00:32:51.278
Yeah. Just...

753
00:32:51.312 --> 00:32:54.517
So, uh, boyfriend?

754
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:57.419
Yeah.

755
00:32:57.452 --> 00:32:59.622
It kind of just slipped out.
Sorry.


756
00:32:59.654 --> 00:33:01.891
Oh. It's just...

757
00:33:01.923 --> 00:33:04.961
From over there, I was
looking at the two of you


758
00:33:04.994 --> 00:33:06.296
and it kind of
looked like, um...


759
00:33:08.131 --> 00:33:09.633
He was my boyfriend?

760
00:33:09.665 --> 00:33:12.501
Where I was standing, it kind of
looked like he could've been.


761
00:33:12.535 --> 00:33:13.637
Oh, God, no.

762
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.342
Okay. Uh, I was...
Too good to be true.


763
00:33:20.243 --> 00:33:21.578
Really?

764
00:33:21.612 --> 00:33:23.314
Yeah.

765
00:33:23.347 --> 00:33:26.885
So, um,

766
00:33:26.917 --> 00:33:29.554
that means, uh...

767
00:33:29.588 --> 00:33:32.090
What?

768
00:33:58.252 --> 00:34:00.955
Uh, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.


769
00:34:00.987 --> 00:34:03.958
I just need to tell you
something quick.


770
00:34:03.992 --> 00:34:05.995
Okay.

771
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.999
Like, I need to...

772
00:34:11.032 --> 00:34:12.167
Oh, like, you want to...

773
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.402
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.


774
00:34:13.434 --> 00:34:15.169
Okay. Sorry.

775
00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:20.644
Okay.

776
00:34:21.643 --> 00:34:23.379
I used to be married.

777
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.216
Like, years ago.

778
00:34:27.248 --> 00:34:30.954
It lasted, like, nine months
and then he left.


779
00:34:33.155 --> 00:34:37.427
Uh, whoa.

780
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:40.297
Yeah.

781
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.068
Um, are you still married?

782
00:34:44.102 --> 00:34:46.071
Oh, no, no, no.
Not anymore.


783
00:34:46.104 --> 00:34:47.439
Not at all.
That's done.


784
00:34:50.575 --> 00:34:53.713
Okay, and that's, like,
behind you and everything?


785
00:34:53.746 --> 00:34:57.215
Yes.

786
00:34:57.248 --> 00:34:59.484
I mean, at this point,
you could have said something


787
00:34:59.518 --> 00:35:01.086
a lot worse
than that.


788
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:05.658
So, if you're okay,
I'm okay.


789
00:35:05.691 --> 00:35:07.727
Okay.

790
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:10.096
Okay.

791
00:35:10.129 --> 00:35:13.466
Although, like, um,

792
00:35:13.499 --> 00:35:15.468
if that's the conversation
we're having,


793
00:35:15.502 --> 00:35:18.206
I mean,
I should tell you that


794
00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:20.340
I've been with
more than one person.


795
00:35:20.373 --> 00:35:23.143
I've been with,
like, 30 people.


796
00:35:30.818 --> 00:35:32.487
Okay.

797
00:35:35.689 --> 00:35:37.693
Okay.

798
00:36:07.192 --> 00:36:08.393
Man, your eyes look weird
upside down.


799
00:36:08.426 --> 00:36:10.161
Your eyes look weird
upside down.


800
00:36:14.332 --> 00:36:17.269
So, you, uh...

801
00:36:17.302 --> 00:36:18.804
...you didn't come there, hey?

802
00:36:18.838 --> 00:36:22.542
No. It's a thing.

803
00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:26.379
Right.

804
00:36:32.384 --> 00:36:35.089
So, like, exactly 30?

805
00:36:35.122 --> 00:36:36.323
Or...

806
00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:05.355
Okay. You know
what you're doing?


807
00:37:05.387 --> 00:37:06.556
I kind of know
what I'm doing.


808
00:37:06.588 --> 00:37:07.623
You kind of know
what you're doing?


809
00:37:07.657 --> 00:37:09.459
This is an important skill
to learn, and I'm trying...


810
00:37:09.492 --> 00:37:11.260
Oh, my God.
Okay.


811
00:37:11.293 --> 00:37:13.329
And this goes here,
and then you're choking,


812
00:37:13.362 --> 00:37:14.530
and it's kind of
like a...-


813
00:37:14.563 --> 00:37:16.133
Ooh.

814
00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.369
Oh, I see what you're
trying to do here, buddy.


815
00:37:18.401 --> 00:37:19.703
What's wrong?
What am I trying to do?


816
00:37:19.736 --> 00:37:22.740
Ah.

817
00:37:22.772 --> 00:37:23.606
You don't seem to care
about it.


818
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.510
Yeah, 'cause I'm
a private person. No.


819
00:37:25.542 --> 00:37:27.278
I definitely don't care, you've
absolutely got that right.


820
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.547
You don't care
about me.


821
00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:29.882
No. It's not that
I don't care about you.


822
00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:33.451
I'm going to give you this.

823
00:37:33.485 --> 00:37:35.921
Really?
What is this?


824
00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.422
Just a little
day-brightener.


825
00:37:43.963 --> 00:37:47.600
Really?
Joni?


826
00:37:47.633 --> 00:37:49.702
Yeah, Joni.

827
00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:52.505
I have a surprise.

828
00:37:52.538 --> 00:37:54.542
Hmm.

829
00:38:02.216 --> 00:38:03.350
Just a little mixtape
for you.


830
00:38:03.382 --> 00:38:05.519
Wait a second.
Did you make this?


831
00:38:05.552 --> 00:38:07.455
Whoa!

832
00:38:11.858 --> 00:38:13.895
Is this
what I think it is?


833
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.370
Oh, my God!
This is so cute.


834
00:38:22.404 --> 00:38:25.241
A new
bullshit planner.


835
00:38:25.274 --> 00:38:27.610
You remembered.

836
00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:29.813
I remembered, yeah.

837
00:38:29.845 --> 00:38:33.217
What the fuck do you mean,
you're in love?


838
00:38:33.249 --> 00:38:35.885
Like, it's been going good
and the feeling is growing


839
00:38:35.918 --> 00:38:40.825
and now when she's not around, I
think I'm in love.


840
00:38:40.857 --> 00:38:42.693
Well, how do you know it's love?
Are you sure it's love?


841
00:38:42.727 --> 00:38:43.861
Are you sure
it's not something else?


842
00:38:43.893 --> 00:38:45.296
What else would it be?

843
00:38:45.328 --> 00:38:46.497
Maybe it's a different emotion.

844
00:38:46.529 --> 00:38:47.999
Maybe you're really angry.

845
00:38:48.031 --> 00:38:49.066
You know, those parts
in your brain


846
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.868
are actually really
close together: love, anger.


847
00:38:50.901 --> 00:38:53.239
- People get confused all the time.
- No, man.


848
00:38:53.271 --> 00:38:55.340
It's...
That's what it is.


849
00:38:55.373 --> 00:38:57.976
That's dramatic.
Nobody is in love anymore.


850
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.845
You know who's in love?

851
00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:01.513
That's who falls in love.

852
00:39:01.545 --> 00:39:03.314
No, man.

853
00:39:03.347 --> 00:39:04.751
I think I want us to move
in together. I don't know.


854
00:39:04.783 --> 00:39:05.818
You're just going
to say...


855
00:39:05.852 --> 00:39:07.420
But you barely know this.
You're going to say it?


856
00:39:07.453 --> 00:39:09.055
You're just going to
come out and say,


857
00:39:09.087 --> 00:39:11.758
- "Let's move in together"?
- Well, I agree that's what I need to figure out, but...


858
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.526
How ridiculous
does that sound?


859
00:39:15.328 --> 00:39:17.765
Whoa, whoa.
You're trying to


860
00:39:17.797 --> 00:39:18.832
bring them back to life,
not kill them.


861
00:39:18.866 --> 00:39:20.701
If you do it faster, they
come back to life faster.


862
00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:21.802
Everybody knows this.

863
00:39:21.835 --> 00:39:23.304
100% not a thing.

864
00:39:24.371 --> 00:39:28.777
So, you think
I'm moving too fast?


865
00:39:28.809 --> 00:39:30.445
I think you're moving
way too fast.


866
00:39:30.477 --> 00:39:32.680
- You think I need to take time?
- Yes.


867
00:39:32.713 --> 00:39:34.649
I'll take time.
I'll leave the city.


868
00:39:34.682 --> 00:39:36.517
- Yes.
- Go on a trip.


869
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.918
Yes! Leave the city.

870
00:39:37.952 --> 00:39:39.922
Go on a trip. Go...
We could do a road trip.


871
00:39:39.955 --> 00:39:41.290
Do you want to go on
a road trip?


872
00:39:41.324 --> 00:39:42.825
Not us. We're not both
going to do it.


873
00:39:42.857 --> 00:39:44.660
What, you don't want to
hang out with me?


874
00:39:44.694 --> 00:39:46.795
We spend a lot of time
together and also,


875
00:39:46.828 --> 00:39:47.964
I think what we're
talking about right now


876
00:39:47.996 --> 00:39:49.431
is me spending time
to myself


877
00:39:49.464 --> 00:39:50.600
trying to figure out
what it is I want


878
00:39:50.632 --> 00:39:53.903
and giving her the space
to figure out what she wants,


879
00:39:53.936 --> 00:39:55.738
and then coming back at it
with some intention.


880
00:39:55.771 --> 00:39:57.006
I think
it's a good idea.


881
00:39:57.039 --> 00:39:58.941
Yeah, it's a good idea.

882
00:39:58.974 --> 00:40:00.009
It's not a bad idea.

883
00:40:00.043 --> 00:40:02.579
It's a good
fucking idea.


884
00:40:02.611 --> 00:40:03.681
This thing is not
fucking working for me.


885
00:40:03.714 --> 00:40:05.049
Yeah.
I don't want to use these, okay?


886
00:40:05.083 --> 00:40:06.451
Just get rid of this,
quick.


887
00:40:06.484 --> 00:40:07.485
What are you doing?

888
00:40:07.518 --> 00:40:09.321
Shh, shh. Just do it on me.
Just do it on me.


889
00:40:09.353 --> 00:40:10.422
No. I'm not going to
do it on you.


890
00:40:10.455 --> 00:40:11.456
Come on. Just give me this.

891
00:40:11.489 --> 00:40:12.590
'Cause you're
just going to, um...


892
00:40:12.623 --> 00:40:13.658
No, come on. Just...

893
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:15.728
This is an actual class
that you wanted to go to.


894
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.095
You're going to get us
kicked out.


895
00:40:17.128 --> 00:40:19.664
- We're not going to get kicked out.
- Yeah, we are.


896
00:40:19.697 --> 00:40:21.900
We're going to get extra credit.

897
00:40:21.934 --> 00:40:23.669
We're supposed to be using
a mask and a mannequin.


898
00:40:23.702 --> 00:40:25.004
Exactly.
A mannequin, okay?


899
00:40:25.037 --> 00:40:26.539
A mannequin is not going to be
dying on the street.


900
00:40:26.572 --> 00:40:28.408
I'm not going to do this
right now with you, okay?


901
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.308
You're a fucking coward.
You're being a coward.


902
00:40:29.341 --> 00:40:31.044
- I dare you.
- I'm not being a coward.


903
00:40:31.076 --> 00:40:32.511
- Oh, my God.
- Do it. Do it. Come on.


904
00:40:32.544 --> 00:40:36.383
Just shut up. Just shut up.
Shh. Okay. 30.


905
00:40:36.415 --> 00:40:37.551
Ready?

906
00:40:37.584 --> 00:40:39.487
Open the airway.

907
00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:41.588
Let's take
the mask off the face.


908
00:40:48.161 --> 00:40:49.396
Do you have an erection
right now?


909
00:40:49.429 --> 00:40:50.431
No.

910
00:40:50.463 --> 00:40:51.667
You do, though.
Oh, my God.


911
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.067
It's not...

912
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.403
It's not for you.

913
00:40:54.435 --> 00:40:56.439
Don't flatter yourself.

914
00:40:59.607 --> 00:41:00.843
Hey. Keep going, everybody.

915
00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:17.762
You must have a boarding
pass and photo ID before entering...


916
00:41:17.794 --> 00:41:18.995
Boo.

917
00:41:21.464 --> 00:41:23.468
Um, I... All right.

918
00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:28.840
Hi.

919
00:41:28.873 --> 00:41:30.409
- Where's mine?
- Thanks for, uh...


920
00:41:30.442 --> 00:41:32.110
Well, I didn't know
if you wanted to start


921
00:41:32.143 --> 00:41:33.478
as early as I have.

922
00:41:33.511 --> 00:41:36.148
So, welcome to here.

923
00:41:36.181 --> 00:41:41.020
Is this one of your spots
to just chill, or...


924
00:41:41.053 --> 00:41:43.990
Uh, no. Not actually.

925
00:41:44.023 --> 00:41:45.791
No. This is all sort of
out of the blue for me.


926
00:41:45.825 --> 00:41:47.026
Is that yours?

927
00:41:48.794 --> 00:41:50.163
Yep.

928
00:41:50.195 --> 00:41:51.697
Oh.

929
00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.667
I'll just jump into it.
I'm going on a trip.


930
00:41:54.701 --> 00:41:55.869
Today.

931
00:41:55.902 --> 00:41:57.070
Oh.

932
00:41:57.103 --> 00:41:58.739
- Which is...
- Today, today.


933
00:41:58.772 --> 00:42:00.974
Yeah, as spontaneous
as it sounds.


934
00:42:01.007 --> 00:42:03.544
- But I...
- Hmm.


935
00:42:03.577 --> 00:42:04.978
I want you to,
you know,


936
00:42:05.012 --> 00:42:08.950
And you want me
to go with you?


937
00:42:08.983 --> 00:42:11.186
Cool.
I brought my passport.


938
00:42:11.218 --> 00:42:13.188
Crazy. Uh...

939
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.058
I mean, I figured,
"Meet at the airport"...


940
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:18.527
I just thought,
in case...


941
00:42:21.129 --> 00:42:24.632
Oh, man. Um...

942
00:42:24.665 --> 00:42:27.804
Sorry. I, uh,

943
00:42:27.836 --> 00:42:30.105
bought a ticket

944
00:42:30.139 --> 00:42:33.143
to go on a trip, like,

945
00:42:33.175 --> 00:42:35.945
just, like, on my own.

946
00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:40.250
You're kidding.

947
00:42:40.283 --> 00:42:41.852
I'm sorry. I...
No, no. I...


948
00:42:41.886 --> 00:42:43.488
- No. You're kidding.
- I really did not...


949
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.754
Yeah, I'm sorry.
No. I just...


950
00:42:44.787 --> 00:42:46.823
You're not kidding.
Holy.


951
00:42:46.857 --> 00:42:49.026
Let me start again.

952
00:42:49.058 --> 00:42:53.197
I love what's going on
between you and I,


953
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.734
and this is part of that.
This is...


954
00:42:56.768 --> 00:43:00.938
I feel seriously
about this.


955
00:43:00.972 --> 00:43:03.176
Simon, if you need to break up
with me you can just do it.


956
00:43:03.209 --> 00:43:06.513
Whoa!
That is, so, so far.


957
00:43:06.546 --> 00:43:07.946
Please don't think that.

958
00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:10.082
If I've said anything
that makes you think that,


959
00:43:10.115 --> 00:43:11.950
forget it.

960
00:43:11.984 --> 00:43:13.286
What? You're going
on a trip. You're not...


961
00:43:13.318 --> 00:43:16.756
Look. Here's the thing.
I'll eat my ticket.


962
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:19.192
I'll literally eat my ticket
if you don't want me to go


963
00:43:19.226 --> 00:43:23.063
because you think it's...
I just think


964
00:43:23.096 --> 00:43:25.965
if we do this... And I know
it's a crazy choice,


965
00:43:25.998 --> 00:43:28.168
but it'll be
this opportunity for us


966
00:43:28.202 --> 00:43:32.240
to make this into
something more intentional.


967
00:43:32.273 --> 00:43:34.575
So, it's like stretching
our wings, right?


968
00:43:34.608 --> 00:43:35.843
It's like sowing
the wild oats


969
00:43:35.876 --> 00:43:38.579
and then coming back
to something


970
00:43:38.613 --> 00:43:40.616
that we really understand
and have perspective on.


971
00:43:40.649 --> 00:43:41.817
But wouldn't that
just poison everything?


972
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.152
Wouldn't that just...

973
00:43:43.185 --> 00:43:46.822
I don't think it will.

974
00:43:46.855 --> 00:43:51.128
But it'd be worth knowing,
no matter what, right?


975
00:43:53.095 --> 00:43:54.898
Will anything that I say
make a difference at all, or...


976
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.333
Like, do I get to
say anything?


977
00:43:57.367 --> 00:43:59.937
Absolutely, absolutely.
Because...


978
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.305
- 'Cause...
- Yes, you absolutely have a say


979
00:44:02.338 --> 00:44:03.908
if you want.

980
00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.276
Okay.

981
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.612
I mean, you and I
are the most important...


982
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.747
- Yeah. Just give me a...
- Yeah.


983
00:44:09.779 --> 00:44:12.583
Let me think
about this.


984
00:44:13.783 --> 00:44:16.154
You're going to...

985
00:44:16.188 --> 00:44:19.057
Okay, yep.
Take five on that.


986
00:44:37.776 --> 00:44:39.212
It's a wild choice.

987
00:44:39.246 --> 00:44:44.085
So, let's do it.

988
00:45:01.269 --> 00:45:02.937
What else
did he say?


989
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.641
He said that
he just needed to go,


990
00:45:05.674 --> 00:45:08.644
and we needed to sow
our wild oats or something.


991
00:45:08.677 --> 00:45:09.846
Who says that?

992
00:45:09.878 --> 00:45:12.714
Simon.

993
00:45:12.748 --> 00:45:15.018
Why? What did you do?
Did you do something?


994
00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:17.021
No. Like, it was just...
Everything was going fine.


995
00:45:17.053 --> 00:45:18.421
I don't know.

996
00:45:18.454 --> 00:45:20.123
Maybe he's just afraid that
it was getting too real.


997
00:45:20.157 --> 00:45:23.292
So, what?
Then you came home after?


998
00:45:23.325 --> 00:45:26.262
Yeah. I just came home
and I let him go.


999
00:45:26.296 --> 00:45:28.366
And then,
I don't know...


1000
00:45:28.398 --> 00:45:31.402
You literally stood there
in the airport like a idiot


1001
00:45:31.435 --> 00:45:32.770
as he left you?

1002
00:45:32.804 --> 00:45:34.673
Yeah.

1003
00:45:34.705 --> 00:45:37.741
Do you not see what's,
like, wrong there?


1004
00:45:37.775 --> 00:45:40.012
I'm just going to wait.

1005
00:45:40.044 --> 00:45:41.947
I mean, two weeks is
not that long, right?


1006
00:45:41.979 --> 00:45:45.818
Did he say something
to you?


1007
00:45:45.851 --> 00:45:47.186
Text you when he landed
or anything?


1008
00:45:47.218 --> 00:45:50.689
No. I think it's, like,
a "break" break.


1009
00:45:50.722 --> 00:45:51.957
I don't hear from him

1010
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:53.960
- for two weeks.
- Are you kidding me?


1011
00:45:53.993 --> 00:45:55.996
No, Iris.

1012
00:45:56.029 --> 00:45:57.364
I just...
I can't do it.


1013
00:45:57.397 --> 00:45:59.199
Stop setting yourself up
to get so hurt.


1014
00:45:59.232 --> 00:46:00.167
Well, I can't do anything.
He's gone.


1015
00:46:00.199 --> 00:46:01.902
I just have to wait
and that's all I can do.


1016
00:46:01.935 --> 00:46:02.969
No, you don't.

1017
00:46:03.003 --> 00:46:06.840
You went from one big
relationship that you, like,


1018
00:46:06.874 --> 00:46:09.043
committed to so hard,
and then...


1019
00:46:09.075 --> 00:46:10.211
Yes. I get it, okay?

1020
00:46:10.244 --> 00:46:11.746
You don't have to
bring it up every time.


1021
00:46:11.778 --> 00:46:12.847
Mom is still
getting over it.


1022
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.283
Okay. We...
Yeah. I know that.


1023
00:46:15.317 --> 00:46:16.719
This is, like,
Chapter 2.


1024
00:46:16.752 --> 00:46:18.487
You can't
just be jumping


1025
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.155
from one relationship
to another


1026
00:46:20.187 --> 00:46:22.857
and, like,
sleep with two people


1027
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.726
your whole entire life.

1028
00:46:24.759 --> 00:46:28.797
I think you need to
go through, like,


1029
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:30.834
a phase.

1030
00:46:33.068 --> 00:46:35.404
Like,
see other people?


1031
00:46:35.438 --> 00:46:37.807
No. I think you need to
ho around for a little bit.


1032
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.243
Oh.

1033
00:46:39.276 --> 00:46:41.479
There's, like,
a reset button


1034
00:46:41.511 --> 00:46:43.113
at the back of
your vagina,


1035
00:46:43.147 --> 00:46:45.750
and I think you need to,
like...


1036
00:46:45.783 --> 00:46:47.051
No.

1037
00:46:47.084 --> 00:46:49.019
I am not going to
go through that.


1038
00:46:49.051 --> 00:46:50.153
No.
I don't need that.


1039
00:46:50.187 --> 00:46:51.289
Yes. Yes, you do.

1040
00:46:51.322 --> 00:46:52.858
Honestly,
when I did it,


1041
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:54.992
- it was just like...
- You went through a phase? Wow.


1042
00:46:55.025 --> 00:46:59.498
Yeah. I went through a phase
and I loved my phase.


1043
00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:03.202
And then I met Justin,
and now my phase is done.


1044
00:47:03.234 --> 00:47:05.838
Like, go have fun.

1045
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:07.173
It's fun.

1046
00:47:07.205 --> 00:47:08.374
You don't have to
worry about anything


1047
00:47:08.406 --> 00:47:11.376
or hurting anybody's feelings
or having your feelings hurt.


1048
00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.914
It's just you and
a bunch of cute dudes.


1049
00:47:14.947 --> 00:47:17.850
No.

1050
00:47:17.884 --> 00:47:19.552
- Yes.
- No!


1051
00:47:19.585 --> 00:47:21.120
Yes.
Give me your phone.


1052
00:47:21.154 --> 00:47:22.856
- No.
- Give me your phone.


1053
00:47:22.889 --> 00:47:24.057
Iris...

1054
00:47:24.089 --> 00:47:25.292
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.


1055
00:47:25.324 --> 00:47:27.361
Give me your phone.

1056
00:47:28.995 --> 00:47:32.032
- Oh, my God. Can you...
- Stop.


1057
00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:34.235
You cannot seriously
be downloading my...


1058
00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:35.168
Yes.

1059
00:47:35.202 --> 00:47:37.471
Oh, my God. You're
actually going to do it.


1060
00:47:37.504 --> 00:47:39.942
You know what? If something
bad happens to me,


1061
00:47:39.975 --> 00:47:41.844
- I'm going to blame you.
- Nothing bad is going to happen to you.


1062
00:47:55.925 --> 00:47:58.961
I'm trying to become
a podcaster, you know?


1063
00:47:58.994 --> 00:48:00.095
And just, like...

1064
00:48:00.128 --> 00:48:04.134
Like talking about music?
Or what kind?


1065
00:48:04.167 --> 00:48:06.203
Uh, you know,
I'm looking more at, like,


1066
00:48:06.236 --> 00:48:08.972
trying to, like,
document the internet.


1067
00:48:09.006 --> 00:48:11.942
I mean, the internet is kind
of a broad subject, but...


1068
00:48:11.975 --> 00:48:13.243
Right? Smile?

1069
00:48:13.277 --> 00:48:15.280
It's, like,
I got a couple of buds


1070
00:48:15.313 --> 00:48:18.182
and we're just going to, like,
you know, kind of, like, chat,


1071
00:48:18.215 --> 00:48:23.221
and it's going to be, like,
just a nice, cool podcast.


1072
00:48:23.255 --> 00:48:24.389
I don't know.

1073
00:48:24.422 --> 00:48:25.590
Uh-huh.

1074
00:48:25.624 --> 00:48:28.928
So, like, you looking
for anything, like,


1075
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:30.529
casual
or whatever?


1076
00:48:30.562 --> 00:48:33.098
What do you mean?

1077
00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:35.400
Show me your tits.

1078
00:48:35.433 --> 00:48:37.604
Ew.

1079
00:48:39.373 --> 00:48:40.507
- Hi.
- Hello.


1080
00:48:40.539 --> 00:48:41.608
- Hi.
- Hello.


1081
00:48:41.641 --> 00:48:43.176
- Hello.
- I like your face.


1082
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:47.514
Thank you... I guess.

1083
00:48:47.547 --> 00:48:48.882
What area of the city
do you live in?


1084
00:48:48.916 --> 00:48:51.152
I live somewhere
in The Maples.


1085
00:48:51.185 --> 00:48:53.521
Oh, nice.
That's close to me.


1086
00:48:53.553 --> 00:48:54.622
Hey, you want to
come over sometime?


1087
00:48:54.656 --> 00:48:57.325
Maybe we should
talk first...


1088
00:48:57.357 --> 00:48:59.026
Oh, cool. Yeah, yeah.
We can talk.


1089
00:48:59.060 --> 00:48:59.995
We can talk.

1090
00:49:00.028 --> 00:49:01.428
Yeah. Tell me something
more about yourself.


1091
00:49:01.461 --> 00:49:04.165
Oh, you know, uh,
I like to dance.


1092
00:49:04.199 --> 00:49:06.903
Hey, do you have
naked pictures?


1093
00:49:06.936 --> 00:49:08.938
I notice that you say
you're a hunter.


1094
00:49:08.971 --> 00:49:10.306
I was just curious
what that meant.


1095
00:49:10.339 --> 00:49:14.043
Uh, it means, like,
I shoot animals.


1096
00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:17.948
And then what do you do?
Like...


1097
00:49:17.981 --> 00:49:19.950
Usually, I just skin it

1098
00:49:19.983 --> 00:49:23.120
and cook it up
and eat it.


1099
00:49:23.153 --> 00:49:26.490
So, you, like,
you gut it and...


1100
00:49:26.523 --> 00:49:27.458
Yeah.

1101
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:29.995
- So, you see all the blood, and...
- Oh, yeah.


1102
00:49:33.464 --> 00:49:36.034
Oh.

1103
00:49:36.067 --> 00:49:38.303
Hey.

1104
00:49:38.335 --> 00:49:40.271
- Hey.
- What's up?


1105
00:49:40.305 --> 00:49:42.308
Not much.

1106
00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.075
I promise that
I'm not a dog face.


1107
00:49:44.108 --> 00:49:46.277
My profile pic
is just my dog.


1108
00:49:46.311 --> 00:49:48.046
- Aw.
- I have a human face.


1109
00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:49.380
Yes. That is...
Yes.


1110
00:49:49.414 --> 00:49:51.351
That's, uh, my dog,
Bailey, though,


1111
00:49:51.384 --> 00:49:54.020
- in the pic, yeah.
- Yeah, I figured.


1112
00:49:54.053 --> 00:49:56.189
- He's very cute.
- Thank you. Thank you. You like dogs?


1113
00:49:56.221 --> 00:49:58.091
- I do. I love dogs.
- Nice.


1114
00:49:58.123 --> 00:50:00.359
- He's not at my apartment right now.
- Aw.


1115
00:50:00.393 --> 00:50:02.028
Yeah.
He's with my parents.


1116
00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.530
I like to let him
go out to the country


1117
00:50:03.563 --> 00:50:04.632
every couple of weeks

1118
00:50:04.664 --> 00:50:06.400
and just, you know, run around.

1119
00:50:06.432 --> 00:50:08.369
It's not... I don't
think it's right


1120
00:50:08.402 --> 00:50:10.570
for a dog to spend its whole
life in the city, so...


1121
00:50:10.603 --> 00:50:12.172
- Yeah.
- ...just give it a break.


1122
00:50:12.206 --> 00:50:13.407
Thoughtful of you.

1123
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.509
Thank you.

1124
00:50:33.496 --> 00:50:36.499
Just a sec.

1125
00:51:56.184 --> 00:51:58.087
Okay.

1126
00:51:58.121 --> 00:51:59.421
That's never happened
to me before.


1127
00:51:59.454 --> 00:52:01.157
No, it's okay. Um...

1128
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.194
But, uh, ready to go.

1129
00:52:03.227 --> 00:52:04.828
Ready to go.

1130
00:52:04.861 --> 00:52:08.164
Yeah. Actually, I was
just going to put my pants on,


1131
00:52:08.198 --> 00:52:09.866
and I was going to go.

1132
00:52:09.899 --> 00:52:11.102
Sorry.

1133
00:52:11.134 --> 00:52:12.736
No, I'm sorry, because it's...

1134
00:52:12.768 --> 00:52:15.172
I just feel it's, like, not
fair to you that...


1135
00:52:15.206 --> 00:52:16.408
- Oh, no, no, no!
- You know?


1136
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:17.576
It's okay. Like, I...

1137
00:52:17.608 --> 00:52:19.877
Because you didn't
finish, either, so...


1138
00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:22.880
Yeah. It's a...
It's fine.


1139
00:52:22.914 --> 00:52:24.749
You don't believe
that I can do this.


1140
00:52:24.782 --> 00:52:26.485
- No, no! I do!
- But I can do this.


1141
00:52:26.518 --> 00:52:28.654
I swear to God, 
I can do this.

1142
00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:31.124
If I can do one thing in
life, it's this sex thing.


1143
00:52:31.156 --> 00:52:32.225
And...

1144
00:52:32.258 --> 00:52:34.127
I... I get that.

1145
00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.428
I'm okay. Thank you.

1146
00:52:35.461 --> 00:52:36.729
Thank you, though. Really.

1147
00:52:36.761 --> 00:52:38.764
I proved to myself that
I can do it in there.


1148
00:52:38.797 --> 00:52:40.366
I wish you saw it,
because it was amazing.


1149
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.269
It was beautiful, and I
want to show it to you now.


1150
00:52:42.302 --> 00:52:43.537
- Okay.
- TMI. First date.


1151
00:52:44.737 --> 00:52:45.905
Here's the thing.

1152
00:52:45.938 --> 00:52:48.375
I really didn't expect

1153
00:52:48.407 --> 00:52:50.744
for this to go so far...

1154
00:52:50.778 --> 00:52:51.646
- Yeah.
- ...so soon.


1155
00:52:51.678 --> 00:52:54.548
Uh, I just really
went on a dating app


1156
00:52:54.582 --> 00:52:56.251
because my sister
told me to.


1157
00:52:56.283 --> 00:52:57.818
- Okay.
- Uh, I...


1158
00:52:57.852 --> 00:52:59.320
Is your sister cool?

1159
00:52:59.352 --> 00:53:00.722
She's getting
married.


1160
00:53:00.754 --> 00:53:03.625
You see, my boyfriend
left, and I... I thought


1161
00:53:03.659 --> 00:53:06.795
that this would really
help me get over it.


1162
00:53:06.828 --> 00:53:09.331
Uh, my sister thinks that
there's a reset button


1163
00:53:09.364 --> 00:53:10.432
at the back
of my vagina,


1164
00:53:10.464 --> 00:53:14.402
but I... I guess
there's not.


1165
00:53:14.435 --> 00:53:16.372
So... Yeah.

1166
00:53:16.405 --> 00:53:17.773
That's like a metaphor.

1167
00:53:17.807 --> 00:53:20.544
I... Yes, I know.

1168
00:53:20.577 --> 00:53:22.279
Oh, God.

1169
00:53:22.311 --> 00:53:24.547
Just go on another one!
It'll be fine!


1170
00:53:24.581 --> 00:53:26.283
I do not want to
go on another one.


1171
00:53:26.316 --> 00:53:27.451
I'm just going to
wait for Simon.


1172
00:53:27.484 --> 00:53:28.920
Uh, what?

1173
00:53:28.953 --> 00:53:30.521
Maybe that's
what Simon meant


1174
00:53:30.554 --> 00:53:33.524
when he said to sow the
wild oats, you know?


1175
00:53:33.556 --> 00:53:34.591
Because now, I just
know that he's the one


1176
00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:37.328
- that I want, so...
- No, that's not what he meant.


1177
00:53:37.361 --> 00:53:38.963
Well, I'm not going
to do it again, Agnes.


1178
00:53:38.996 --> 00:53:41.399
You did not
sow your wild oats!


1179
00:53:41.432 --> 00:53:43.235
You sowed one oat.

1180
00:53:43.267 --> 00:53:45.836
You had one, okay?
So, go on another one!


1181
00:53:45.869 --> 00:53:47.471
- No!
- Ah, frick, Iris.


1182
00:53:47.505 --> 00:53:48.941
- I just don't want to.
- I can't believe


1183
00:53:48.974 --> 00:53:51.444
you did not put the keys in
your frickin' pocket!


1184
00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:24.778
- You got me.
- Mm-hmm.


1185
00:54:24.812 --> 00:54:26.749
- Hello.
- That's good. Hi.


1186
00:54:26.782 --> 00:54:28.484
Hi.

1187
00:54:28.516 --> 00:54:30.719
Ho, it's easy to forget how
cold this city is!


1188
00:54:30.753 --> 00:54:33.689
Did
you miss it?


1189
00:54:33.721 --> 00:54:35.757
No, I didn't
miss it, per se.


1190
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:37.426
- Mm.
- Missed you.


1191
00:54:37.458 --> 00:54:40.030
Hey, you didn't get any of
my text messages, eh?


1192
00:54:40.062 --> 00:54:42.298
No. Just... I just got
them all right now.


1193
00:54:42.332 --> 00:54:44.501
- Ho, that's bad.
- I know.


1194
00:54:44.533 --> 00:54:45.702
- But...
- You got mine?


1195
00:54:45.734 --> 00:54:49.272
Yeah, all at once. I thought
my phone was going to blow up.


1196
00:54:49.305 --> 00:54:50.540
Sorry.

1197
00:54:50.574 --> 00:54:52.476
Yeah. No.
I'm sorry, too.


1198
00:54:52.509 --> 00:54:55.647
Um, actually,
I'm...


1199
00:54:55.679 --> 00:54:58.348
I'm really sorry, because
that trip kind of was


1200
00:54:58.382 --> 00:54:59.349
what I thought
it was going to be,


1201
00:54:59.382 --> 00:55:02.553
and... and I had a lot
of time to think, but...


1202
00:55:02.586 --> 00:55:03.722
I had a lot
of time to think,


1203
00:55:03.754 --> 00:55:05.390
and, uh, one of
the things I realized...


1204
00:55:05.423 --> 00:55:08.793
- It's right here.
- ...was, uh...


1205
00:55:08.827 --> 00:55:10.029
that maybe it seemed
like a good idea,


1206
00:55:10.062 --> 00:55:12.064
but it was
a selfish idea.


1207
00:55:12.097 --> 00:55:15.034
And... I'm embarrassed

1208
00:55:15.067 --> 00:55:17.002
that I even
went through with it,


1209
00:55:17.036 --> 00:55:18.638
and I'm sorry
about that.


1210
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.973
It's okay.

1211
00:55:21.007 --> 00:55:22.075
You're here now.

1212
00:55:22.107 --> 00:55:24.743
Thank you for
being cool.


1213
00:55:24.777 --> 00:55:27.314
Get in, then.

1214
00:55:27.347 --> 00:55:30.450
But the other thing that
I realized was, um...


1215
00:55:30.483 --> 00:55:32.652
Or... Sorry.

1216
00:55:32.686 --> 00:55:34.421
Hi.

1217
00:55:34.454 --> 00:55:35.588
Hi.

1218
00:55:35.622 --> 00:55:37.358
Uh...

1219
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:43.064
Uh, before you
take off...


1220
00:55:43.098 --> 00:55:44.733
When I was down there
and, uh,


1221
00:55:44.765 --> 00:55:48.502
I had all that
space that you were...


1222
00:55:48.536 --> 00:55:49.971
- Yeah.
- ...good enough to give me.


1223
00:55:50.004 --> 00:55:51.541
You probably sowed
your wild oats


1224
00:55:51.574 --> 00:55:52.974
and slept with a
whole bunch of women,


1225
00:55:53.007 --> 00:55:55.677
so now, we got
to talk about it.


1226
00:55:55.711 --> 00:55:59.549
What? No.

1227
00:55:59.581 --> 00:56:01.616
No. That's not at all what
I meant when I said that.


1228
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.419
Is that what you
thought I was doing?


1229
00:56:03.453 --> 00:56:05.355
Yeah.

1230
00:56:05.388 --> 00:56:06.823
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.


1231
00:56:06.857 --> 00:56:08.759
No, no, no. I didn't
mean that at all.


1232
00:56:08.792 --> 00:56:10.494
I meant to...

1233
00:56:10.526 --> 00:56:11.828
Geez. Yeah. No.

1234
00:56:11.861 --> 00:56:13.596
I was, like, alone
the whole time


1235
00:56:13.629 --> 00:56:16.835
and I was... I was
thinking about you.


1236
00:56:16.867 --> 00:56:20.637
And I was thinking about all
the stuff that I...


1237
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.406
...that I already
knew before I left.


1238
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.744
And that's that...
you know...


1239
00:56:25.777 --> 00:56:27.780
uh...

1240
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:32.752
I love you and...

1241
00:56:32.785 --> 00:56:35.388
I want to move
in together.


1242
00:56:35.421 --> 00:56:39.025
And... that's it.

1243
00:56:40.058 --> 00:56:42.428
I had a... a whole thing that
I was going to say,


1244
00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:44.431
and now, I can't
remember it at all.


1245
00:56:47.567 --> 00:56:49.570
Right.

1246
00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:56.610
And... and take your time,
but just know that I...


1247
00:56:56.644 --> 00:56:59.446
can't breathe
right now, so...


1248
00:56:59.479 --> 00:57:01.515
Right.

1249
00:57:03.185 --> 00:57:04.686
Yeah!

1250
00:57:04.719 --> 00:57:06.789
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.


1251
00:57:06.822 --> 00:57:08.624
That doesn't seem
crazy to you? That's...


1252
00:57:08.656 --> 00:57:09.924
No! No.

1253
00:57:09.958 --> 00:57:11.460
Yeah. Yeah, it is, but...

1254
00:57:13.194 --> 00:57:17.166
But no. Yeah. I would
love to move in with you.


1255
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.436
Okay.

1256
00:57:22.003 --> 00:57:25.741
God, you took two weeks
to figure that out?


1257
00:57:25.774 --> 00:57:26.911
Geez.

1258
00:57:26.944 --> 00:57:28.946
Moving in together?

1259
00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:32.082
Yeah. I've decided to
move in with Simon.


1260
00:57:32.114 --> 00:57:34.718
What?

1261
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.853
Do... do you
know this guy?


1262
00:57:38.187 --> 00:57:39.790
Ma, it's been a while.
We've been dating a while.


1263
00:57:39.824 --> 00:57:40.959
"It's been a while." You
would say that?


1264
00:57:40.992 --> 00:57:42.727
A while, Iris?

1265
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.630
Arthur! Arthur...

1266
00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:50.001
Talk to your daughter.

1267
00:57:50.034 --> 00:57:53.538
We're so busy with the social,
and here goes your daughter


1268
00:57:53.571 --> 00:57:57.609
saying she's moving with
Simon. I don't even know...


1269
00:57:57.642 --> 00:57:58.910
Do you know Simon?

1270
00:57:58.944 --> 00:58:00.513
Who's Simon? No.

1271
00:58:02.782 --> 00:58:04.017
Ma.

1272
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.787
What will they say?
What will our friends say?


1273
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.588
We're Catholic.

1274
00:58:12.692 --> 00:58:13.592
I am 23, and...

1275
00:58:13.626 --> 00:58:15.263
Twenty-three!

1276
00:58:15.296 --> 00:58:18.633
...before, when you
got married with this Bong,


1277
00:58:18.665 --> 00:58:20.501
and then you got
this divorce.


1278
00:58:20.535 --> 00:58:23.770
Oh, my God!

1279
00:58:23.803 --> 00:58:24.805
...relatives and friends.

1280
00:58:24.839 --> 00:58:26.709
- But Ma, I was 19.
- What do you say about this?


1281
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:27.876
I didn't know what I was...

1282
00:58:31.246 --> 00:58:33.883
This is not
the right time.


1283
00:58:33.916 --> 00:58:38.020
Okay? This is going too far.

1284
00:58:38.052 --> 00:58:40.055
Nope, nope, nope.

1285
00:58:41.156 --> 00:58:43.593
I forbid you
for doing this.


1286
00:58:43.626 --> 00:58:44.794
Nope.

1287
00:58:44.827 --> 00:58:46.629
...moving, moving. Nothing.

1288
00:58:51.335 --> 00:58:53.237
She's going to do
it anyway, Mom.


1289
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:56.706
I know!

1290
00:58:56.739 --> 00:58:58.642
You're being quiet.

1291
00:58:58.676 --> 00:59:02.246
I have seen your heart.

1292
00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.950
I know. That's it.

1293
00:59:04.983 --> 00:59:06.251
You've decided.

1294
00:59:06.283 --> 00:59:07.619
Do you think you're
doing it right?


1295
00:59:07.651 --> 00:59:10.121
If you think you're
doing it right,


1296
00:59:10.155 --> 00:59:12.024
I'm out of this.
We're done.


1297
00:59:21.967 --> 00:59:23.036
Got it?

1298
00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:26.307
Yep.

1299
00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:29.075
Uh, let's just
bring everything in here,


1300
00:59:29.108 --> 00:59:33.146
and then we'll do
it in here.


1301
00:59:36.016 --> 00:59:38.184
Okay.

1302
00:59:38.217 --> 00:59:39.620
That is one trip, one trip.

1303
00:59:39.654 --> 00:59:40.989
- No problem.
- Okay.


1304
00:59:41.022 --> 00:59:42.290
Did you talk to your
parents about all this?


1305
00:59:42.323 --> 00:59:44.326
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah?


1306
00:59:44.359 --> 00:59:46.728
- Yeah.
- And they're cool with it, or...


1307
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:49.096
Um...

1308
00:59:49.129 --> 00:59:50.333
What is this thing?

1309
00:59:50.365 --> 00:59:54.603
What do you mean? It's
an ironing board.


1310
01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:02.311
Your shirt's inside out.

1311
01:00:02.345 --> 01:00:03.846
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.


1312
01:00:03.879 --> 01:00:05.816
I get to wear
it twice like this.


1313
01:00:05.848 --> 01:00:08.885
Okay. Hold
on. Hold on.


1314
01:00:12.721 --> 01:00:16.326
Oh, God. Uh, do
you always


1315
01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.630
wear your shoes
inside the house?


1316
01:00:18.663 --> 01:00:20.865
Uh, not all
the time.


1317
01:00:20.898 --> 01:00:22.000
I take them
off to shower.


1318
01:00:22.032 --> 01:00:25.168
Good. Uh...

1319
01:00:25.201 --> 01:00:28.206
- Do you want me to take them off?
- Yes, please,


1320
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.176
because it's going
to be a thing.


1321
01:00:31.209 --> 01:00:33.178
- I don't want to start a thing.
- Thank you.


1322
01:00:33.211 --> 01:00:36.015
But how do
you... know?


1323
01:00:36.048 --> 01:00:39.185
Please. Watch.

1324
01:00:39.217 --> 01:00:41.087
Clean.

1325
01:00:42.755 --> 01:00:45.025
Also clean.

1326
01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.060
Okay.

1327
01:00:48.293 --> 01:00:50.096
What are you
doing in there?


1328
01:00:50.128 --> 01:00:52.767
Laundry basket?

1329
01:00:55.968 --> 01:00:57.972
- What's that for?
- It'll just live there,


1330
01:00:58.004 --> 01:01:02.743
and you don't have to
ask about it ever again.


1331
01:01:02.777 --> 01:01:04.212
Banana sauce?

1332
01:01:04.245 --> 01:01:05.813
It's ketchup.

1333
01:01:05.846 --> 01:01:07.882
No, it's
banana sauce.


1334
01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:09.250
What? Do you
put this on bananas,


1335
01:01:09.283 --> 01:01:10.918
or is it made with bananas?

1336
01:01:10.951 --> 01:01:12.386
It's ketchup.

1337
01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:15.058
It's got
bananas in it.


1338
01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:15.958
Oh.

1339
01:01:15.992 --> 01:01:18.194
Uh, we're going to
have to go shopping.


1340
01:01:18.226 --> 01:01:19.194
- What?
- Yeah.


1341
01:01:19.227 --> 01:01:20.262
I have
so much food.


1342
01:01:20.296 --> 01:01:22.965
No! There's not enough.
What if people come over?


1343
01:01:22.997 --> 01:01:25.034
Well, what if people come over
and they don't want to eat?


1344
01:01:25.066 --> 01:01:26.303
Well, they're going
to eat anyway,


1345
01:01:26.335 --> 01:01:27.337
because you
serve them food.


1346
01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:30.440
Where did
the sauce go?


1347
01:01:30.473 --> 01:01:32.008
Up there.

1348
01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:34.011
I think that
clears this box.


1349
01:01:34.044 --> 01:01:35.411
Wow. We did it.

1350
01:01:35.444 --> 01:01:36.779
Awesome.

1351
01:01:36.812 --> 01:01:38.015
Superstar.

1352
01:01:38.047 --> 01:01:41.251
Okay. So...

1353
01:01:41.284 --> 01:01:45.222
I would love for you to
meet my family on Saturday.


1354
01:01:46.157 --> 01:01:48.425
It's Agnes's
social. It's...


1355
01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:49.559
- Right.
- It's this Saturday,


1356
01:01:49.594 --> 01:01:54.232
and I think it would be great
if you would could come.


1357
01:01:55.234 --> 01:01:56.902
- I would love to.
- Yeah?


1358
01:01:56.935 --> 01:01:58.404
Yeah.

1359
01:01:58.437 --> 01:02:00.139
Okay.

1360
01:02:02.141 --> 01:02:05.177
Oh, my God.

1361
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.981
I think
that's it.


1362
01:02:09.014 --> 01:02:10.349
- Yay.
- We're done.


1363
01:02:10.382 --> 01:02:12.385
Yes.

1364
01:02:13.786 --> 01:02:16.757
Now what?

1365
01:02:21.428 --> 01:02:24.466
Play that bass.

1366
01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.002
No.

1367
01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:29.404
Aw. You know you can't
escape me anymore.


1368
01:02:29.436 --> 01:02:30.938
No, no,
no, no, no.


1369
01:02:30.971 --> 01:02:32.306
You are not yet ready,

1370
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.909
and by "you," I mean
me and the bass.


1371
01:02:33.942 --> 01:02:37.980
I live
here now, so...


1372
01:02:39.115 --> 01:02:40.250
Some other time.

1373
01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:42.118
- Boo!
- I have something better,


1374
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:45.488
actually, if
you'll follow me.


1375
01:02:45.521 --> 01:02:47.423
- Just over here.
- Okay.


1376
01:02:47.455 --> 01:02:48.892
Roomie.

1377
01:03:01.071 --> 01:03:02.374
What is that
supposed to be?


1378
01:03:02.407 --> 01:03:03.941
That is, uh,
supposed to be


1379
01:03:03.974 --> 01:03:05.409
your face
on a cake...


1380
01:03:05.443 --> 01:03:06.812
- Oh, no.
- ...which I know


1381
01:03:06.845 --> 01:03:08.814
you've always
wanted.


1382
01:03:08.847 --> 01:03:10.381
It was... I
did a sketch,


1383
01:03:10.414 --> 01:03:12.483
and then I thought I could put
the sketch on a cake.


1384
01:03:12.517 --> 01:03:14.353
And so I got someone
else to do it, and it...


1385
01:03:14.386 --> 01:03:16.189
- Ah. Sure.
- ...uh, it turned into that...


1386
01:03:16.221 --> 01:03:17.823
- Blame it on the artist.
- ...which is, in my defence,


1387
01:03:17.857 --> 01:03:20.159
not actually what I drew.

1388
01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:22.195
But, uh, it still
might be fun to eat.


1389
01:03:22.228 --> 01:03:23.362
It's so awful!

1390
01:03:24.897 --> 01:03:25.931
Yeah, it's
a little scary,


1391
01:03:25.964 --> 01:03:29.036
but that's why we got
to get rid of the evidence.


1392
01:03:29.068 --> 01:03:30.336
But it... You know,
it only lasts


1393
01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:32.238
as long as it takes
us to eat this, so...


1394
01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:36.442
Eat.

1395
01:03:37.443 --> 01:03:42.182
- You alright?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.


1396
01:03:45.285 --> 01:03:48.121
Hey, whoa.

1397
01:03:50.324 --> 01:03:52.327
Hey.

1398
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.496
I can't do this. I
can't do this to you.


1399
01:03:54.528 --> 01:03:58.568
I can't do
this to you.


1400
01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:05.007
I'm so sorry.

1401
01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.044
I'm so sorry.

1402
01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:09.979
For what?
You're freaking me out.


1403
01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:13.549
No, no.

1404
01:04:13.582 --> 01:04:16.152
- Are you okay?
- No.


1405
01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:26.231
I slept with
someone else...


1406
01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:28.867
while you were gone.

1407
01:04:30.602 --> 01:04:34.640
I'm so sorry.

1408
01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:41.214
I'm so sorry.

1409
01:04:41.246 --> 01:04:45.018
I just wanted
you here, but...


1410
01:04:45.051 --> 01:04:49.089
but I thought I'd
lost you, so...


1411
01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:02.069
No, please
say something.


1412
01:05:05.172 --> 01:05:07.641
You wait until now
to tell me?


1413
01:05:07.674 --> 01:05:08.709
I...

1414
01:05:08.743 --> 01:05:10.545
Well, you got home,

1415
01:05:10.578 --> 01:05:14.450
and then you... you
told me you loved me.


1416
01:05:14.483 --> 01:05:18.988
And it's all I ever
wanted, and I...


1417
01:05:19.755 --> 01:05:22.023
I couldn't...

1418
01:05:22.057 --> 01:05:25.228
Right.

1419
01:05:27.397 --> 01:05:29.366
When were you
going to tell me?


1420
01:05:29.399 --> 01:05:31.000
Because you've
already moved in,


1421
01:05:31.033 --> 01:05:34.171
so that's...
fucking great.


1422
01:05:34.203 --> 01:05:35.372
- That's good.
- I... They were going to...


1423
01:05:35.404 --> 01:05:37.173
So, just the moment
I left, you just thought


1424
01:05:37.207 --> 01:05:39.309
that that would be prime
opportunity to do that, or what?


1425
01:05:39.342 --> 01:05:43.013
No, no! You told me to
sow my wild oats,


1426
01:05:43.047 --> 01:05:45.182
- and so I did. It's...
- That's not what that means!


1427
01:05:45.215 --> 01:05:47.351
Of course it is!
How could you not know?


1428
01:05:47.385 --> 01:05:49.687
How is that what that means
in... in that context?


1429
01:05:49.719 --> 01:05:51.589
It means "take what you have
and go out in the world,"


1430
01:05:51.622 --> 01:05:53.658
not "just fuck a bunch
of guys the second I'm gone!"


1431
01:05:53.691 --> 01:05:56.260
It was just...

1432
01:05:56.294 --> 01:05:57.496
I didn't know,
okay? I'm sorry.


1433
01:05:57.528 --> 01:05:58.997
Yeah, you didn't
know. You just heard


1434
01:05:59.031 --> 01:06:00.432
whatever you needed to
hear in that moment,


1435
01:06:00.464 --> 01:06:01.733
which is...

1436
01:06:01.767 --> 01:06:03.636
But you
left, Simon.


1437
01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:05.637
You asked
for a break.


1438
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.506
- No! I... That's not what I said.
- You asked for a break!


1439
01:06:07.539 --> 01:06:09.108
- And you know...
- That's not what I said at all!


1440
01:06:09.141 --> 01:06:10.676
Yes, it was, and
you know what?


1441
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:13.512
That's what people say when they
never want to come back, okay?


1442
01:06:13.545 --> 01:06:16.082
That's what fucking Bong said,
so of course I was going


1443
01:06:16.115 --> 01:06:17.484
to think I was never
going to have you back!


1444
01:06:17.517 --> 01:06:20.521
What are you talking about?
Well, that's not me!


1445
01:06:20.553 --> 01:06:24.459
It's just you. It's just you
on your own with that decision!


1446
01:06:28.429 --> 01:06:30.498
Oh, you destroyed this.

1447
01:06:30.531 --> 01:06:34.535
No. I didn't mean to.

1448
01:06:39.608 --> 01:06:42.445
I didn't know, okay?

1449
01:06:42.477 --> 01:06:44.379
What are you doing?

1450
01:06:44.412 --> 01:06:46.416
Where are you going?

1451
01:06:46.448 --> 01:06:49.452
Simon, wait.

1452
01:07:13.744 --> 01:07:16.281
I... I...

1453
01:07:16.314 --> 01:07:20.085
I would do
anything, anything,


1454
01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:21.754
just to take back
everything that I did


1455
01:07:21.786 --> 01:07:25.825
and make this
all okay.


1456
01:07:28.128 --> 01:07:32.166
So can you come back and
work this out, please?


1457
01:07:39.205 --> 01:07:41.209
Simon?

1458
01:07:51.253 --> 01:07:53.255
Simon?

1459
01:09:38.768 --> 01:09:40.804
Yo, Simon. I was just
shaving. What's up?


1460
01:09:40.838 --> 01:09:43.941
Hey. Uh, it's actually Iris.

1461
01:09:43.973 --> 01:09:45.675
- Who?
- Hey.


1462
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:47.577
Why are you... Hold up. What are
you doing with Simon's phone?


1463
01:09:47.611 --> 01:09:49.247
- Who is this?
- It's Iris.


1464
01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.750
Uh, Simon's girlfriend?

1465
01:09:51.782 --> 01:09:53.417
Oh, okay.

1466
01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:54.920
Why you got
Simon's phone?


1467
01:09:54.952 --> 01:09:56.020
Where's Simon?

1468
01:09:56.054 --> 01:09:58.790
Uh, yeah. I was actually
going to ask you


1469
01:09:58.822 --> 01:10:00.959
if you knew where he was.

1470
01:10:00.992 --> 01:10:02.495
Uh, no, no.

1471
01:10:02.528 --> 01:10:05.898
He hasn't... he hasn't
texted me. Why?


1472
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.800
Mm. Okay.

1473
01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:12.404
I just wanted to ask,
because he... uh... he...


1474
01:10:12.438 --> 01:10:14.408
left, so...

1475
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.644
Uh, what do you
want from me?


1476
01:10:16.677 --> 01:10:18.312
He's not with
you, huh?


1477
01:10:18.345 --> 01:10:19.512
No, he's not.

1478
01:10:19.546 --> 01:10:20.681
Is that all you
need? Are we done?


1479
01:10:20.713 --> 01:10:24.417
Actually, uh, do you know
where his parents live at all?


1480
01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:26.987
Like, their
address or...


1481
01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:28.590
No. I don't know. They
live in one of those


1482
01:10:28.623 --> 01:10:30.325
fucking Mennonite... Uh,
Morden. Morden.


1483
01:10:30.357 --> 01:10:31.860
That's the name of
the town, right?


1484
01:10:31.892 --> 01:10:33.994
No. What... Why are you asking
me where his parents live?


1485
01:10:34.027 --> 01:10:35.329
Why? That's none of your
fucking business.


1486
01:10:35.362 --> 01:10:36.931
- But it's...
- Stop freaking out about all...


1487
01:10:36.963 --> 01:10:38.967
Simon just leaves
sometimes, alright?


1488
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.535
He just leaves.
Just leave it alone.


1489
01:10:40.568 --> 01:10:42.705
Do you know exactly where in
Morden he lives, or...


1490
01:10:42.737 --> 01:10:45.040
No, I don't know where
in Morden his parents live.


1491
01:10:45.073 --> 01:10:47.677
I don't think you should be
asking those questions.


1492
01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:50.314
Ugh. Whatever.

1493
01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:55.818
Hey. Uh...

1494
01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:58.955
How are you? I haven't
seen you in so long.


1495
01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.826
Hi! Nice to see you!
How've you been?


1496
01:11:01.859 --> 01:11:02.994
Good. Are you guys
just helping out


1497
01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:05.029
with the stuff for
the social?


1498
01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:07.364
Hi, Iris.

1499
01:11:07.398 --> 01:11:10.435
Those look nice.

1500
01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:15.106
Can I have
two of those?


1501
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.709
Mila, do you have enough?

1502
01:11:16.741 --> 01:11:17.743
Yeah. I do.

1503
01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:19.010
Hi, Pa.

1504
01:11:19.043 --> 01:11:21.446
Iris...

1505
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.083
I was wondering if
I could borrow the car.


1506
01:11:24.115 --> 01:11:24.949
- Car?
- Yeah. I'm...


1507
01:11:24.984 --> 01:11:26.952
- Where are you doing?
- I'm going to Morden,


1508
01:11:26.986 --> 01:11:30.090
just to meet Simon's family,
and he's already there,


1509
01:11:30.123 --> 01:11:33.960
so I just need
to... get there.


1510
01:11:33.992 --> 01:11:36.963
Okay. Uh, before
I give you the keys,


1511
01:11:36.995 --> 01:11:38.932
come closer.

1512
01:11:38.965 --> 01:11:41.035
- Okay.
- Now...


1513
01:11:41.068 --> 01:11:43.804
let's forget about this for now.

1514
01:11:43.836 --> 01:11:46.506
You know what?

1515
01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.875
I just want you
to know,


1516
01:11:47.907 --> 01:11:51.112
your mom really loves
you, okay?


1517
01:11:51.145 --> 01:11:54.882
She only wants you to
be happy, okay?


1518
01:11:54.916 --> 01:11:56.418
- Okay.
- Yeah?


1519
01:11:56.451 --> 01:11:59.520
If Simon will be the
right guy for you


1520
01:11:59.554 --> 01:12:00.654
and you will
be happy...


1521
01:12:00.688 --> 01:12:02.725
Yes, Pa. Of course.

1522
01:12:02.757 --> 01:12:07.028
...Hundred percent...

1523
01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:09.998
Yeah? I'm going to
support you 100 percent.


1524
01:12:10.031 --> 01:12:11.934
- Okay.
- Hundred and one now. Okay?


1525
01:12:11.967 --> 01:12:13.436
Okay.

1526
01:12:13.468 --> 01:12:16.673
That's one percent more.

1527
01:12:16.705 --> 01:12:17.740
But be sure.

1528
01:12:17.773 --> 01:12:18.808
Mm-hmm.

1529
01:12:18.842 --> 01:12:22.846
Okay?

1530
01:12:22.879 --> 01:12:26.117
Don't put your family
through this...


1531
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:28.920
- Yes, Pa.
- ...unless this is the right guy.


1532
01:12:28.952 --> 01:12:30.053
Okay?

1533
01:12:30.086 --> 01:12:31.688
Yes, Pa.

1534
01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:32.689
Remember that.

1535
01:13:31.254 --> 01:13:32.389
He might have
a library card,


1536
01:13:32.421 --> 01:13:36.526
but we are not allowed to give
out our patron information


1537
01:13:36.559 --> 01:13:37.928
because of the
Privacy Act.


1538
01:13:37.961 --> 01:13:39.663
Right.

1539
01:13:39.695 --> 01:13:42.533
Perhaps a...
phone book, maybe? Uh...


1540
01:13:42.565 --> 01:13:43.399
- Yeah.
- Yeah?


1541
01:13:43.434 --> 01:13:44.768
Yeah, we have a phone
book. For sure.


1542
01:13:44.801 --> 01:13:46.604
Okay!

1543
01:13:46.636 --> 01:13:48.171
Oh, wow.

1544
01:13:48.204 --> 01:13:49.673
That's a lot of Friesens.

1545
01:13:49.707 --> 01:13:53.744
There are a
few Friesens.


1546
01:14:01.954 --> 01:14:04.624
Excuse me!

1547
01:14:04.656 --> 01:14:07.692
Sorry. Uh, are you
from here?


1548
01:14:07.726 --> 01:14:09.929
No. I'm actually
from Winnipeg. Sorry.


1549
01:14:09.962 --> 01:14:13.299
Okay. Yeah. You didn't look
familiar. Are you, um...


1550
01:14:13.331 --> 01:14:14.634
- Yes.
- ...Filipino? Okay.


1551
01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:15.602
Filipino.

1552
01:14:15.634 --> 01:14:16.702
Um, you look lost.

1553
01:14:16.736 --> 01:14:18.705
Are you okay?
Do you need help?


1554
01:14:18.737 --> 01:14:21.207
Actually, I'm looking for
my boyfriend, Simon Friesen.


1555
01:14:21.241 --> 01:14:23.210
Uh, do you know him?

1556
01:14:23.242 --> 01:14:25.077
Everybody's Friesen here.

1557
01:14:25.111 --> 01:14:26.080
Yeah.

1558
01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:27.782
I don't know
if I know him,


1559
01:14:27.814 --> 01:14:29.317
but my daughter might
know him.


1560
01:14:29.349 --> 01:14:30.317
She knows everybody...

1561
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:31.719
- Okay.
- ...I think.


1562
01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:33.654
Uh, I just live
around the corner.


1563
01:14:33.688 --> 01:14:35.723
Are you hungry?
You must be hungry.


1564
01:14:35.756 --> 01:14:37.560
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I actually, uh,


1565
01:14:37.592 --> 01:14:39.093
just grabbed
something to eat.


1566
01:14:39.127 --> 01:14:41.864
Oh, no. I'll give
you a snack. Ramon!


1567
01:14:41.896 --> 01:14:44.832
- Hey.
- I want you to meet somebody.


1568
01:14:44.865 --> 01:14:45.766
- Hi.
- And here.


1569
01:14:45.801 --> 01:14:48.137
- I brought you a surprise.
- Ooh! Thank you.


1570
01:14:48.169 --> 01:14:49.972
- This is Iris.
- Hi. Hi.


1571
01:14:50.006 --> 01:14:51.341
You can call me Ram.
How are you doing?


1572
01:14:51.374 --> 01:14:52.943
- Good.
- Good. You hungry?


1573
01:14:52.976 --> 01:14:54.244
- No. I'm okay, actually.
- Oh, come on.


1574
01:14:54.276 --> 01:14:55.945
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We'll give you a little bit.


1575
01:14:55.978 --> 01:14:57.146
Come on.
Just a little snack.


1576
01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:59.816
Jane, um, I found Iris
wandering around town.


1577
01:14:59.848 --> 01:15:01.317
She came all the way
from Winnipeg...


1578
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:02.653
- Yeah.
- ...looking for somebody.


1579
01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:04.621
I told her that you
might know him.


1580
01:15:04.655 --> 01:15:07.657
- What's his name again?
- Uh, Simon. Simon Friesen.


1581
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:09.794
- Mm-hmm.
- Simon Friesen.


1582
01:15:09.826 --> 01:15:12.128
Yeah. He lived
over there... a long time ago.


1583
01:15:12.161 --> 01:15:13.831
By the store?

1584
01:15:13.864 --> 01:15:15.800
No.

1585
01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:18.002
If we get in the car,
can you take us there?


1586
01:15:18.036 --> 01:15:20.238
Yeah.
I'd recognize it.


1587
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.238
Okay.

1588
01:15:21.272 --> 01:15:22.239
That would be great.

1589
01:15:22.273 --> 01:15:23.441
Okay. Well, if you're going
to drive there,


1590
01:15:23.474 --> 01:15:27.012
you should know that nobody's
been there for a long time.


1591
01:15:27.046 --> 01:15:30.050
Uh... what do
you mean? Like...


1592
01:16:25.842 --> 01:16:27.845
Hey!

1593
01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:34.051
Do you... Excuse me!

1594
01:16:34.084 --> 01:16:36.253
You... Do you live here?

1595
01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:37.890
I live over there.

1596
01:16:37.923 --> 01:16:39.058
What's your name?

1597
01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:40.892
Allison.

1598
01:16:40.926 --> 01:16:45.164
I'm Iris.
What are you doing here?


1599
01:16:45.196 --> 01:16:47.432
Vaping.

1600
01:16:47.466 --> 01:16:50.903
I'm here to look
for Simon, Simon Friesen.


1601
01:16:50.937 --> 01:16:52.138
- Yeah?
- You wouldn't happen to know him,


1602
01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:54.339
- would you?
- I know him.


1603
01:16:54.372 --> 01:16:55.340
- You do?
- Yeah.


1604
01:16:55.374 --> 01:16:59.045
Uh, do you know if anybody
still lives there?


1605
01:16:59.077 --> 01:17:00.780
Do you know
if he's...


1606
01:17:00.812 --> 01:17:03.283
Simon and
his dad did.


1607
01:17:03.317 --> 01:17:07.421
Okay! Do you know if his
dad is still in there?


1608
01:17:07.453 --> 01:17:09.489
He died three
years ago.


1609
01:17:09.523 --> 01:17:11.459
Oh.

1610
01:17:12.925 --> 01:17:15.029
Okay.

1611
01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:17.032
He was a mess.

1612
01:17:17.064 --> 01:17:19.867
He was always yelling,
angry at Simon.


1613
01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.936
My parents wouldn't
even let me go over...


1614
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:25.173
Um, this is Simon
Friesen, right?


1615
01:17:25.206 --> 01:17:27.510
- Yeah, Simon Friesen.
- Like, blue eyes, dark hair?


1616
01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:29.378
- That's... that's him?
- Yeah.


1617
01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:31.379
How did his dad die?

1618
01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.850
He died from drugs
and alcohol.


1619
01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:37.119
Simon stuck around to
take care of him, but...


1620
01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:39.757
And then he left?

1621
01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:41.457
And he just took
a bus to Winnipeg,


1622
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:45.729
and nobody's
seen him since.


1623
01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:50.401
What about his mom? What
happened to his mom?


1624
01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:55.339
His mom left him when he
was, like... three.


1625
01:17:55.372 --> 01:17:58.442
Moved to BC,
I think.


1626
01:17:58.475 --> 01:18:01.514
That's what
they say.


1627
01:18:10.122 --> 01:18:11.924
- Hi.
- Oh! hi!


1628
01:18:11.957 --> 01:18:12.858
Hi.

1629
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:14.093
How are you?

1630
01:18:14.127 --> 01:18:15.796
- Um, I'm good.
- Yeah?


1631
01:18:15.828 --> 01:18:16.996
- How about you?
- Good.


1632
01:18:17.029 --> 01:18:18.063
Are you leaving?

1633
01:18:18.096 --> 01:18:20.300
Yeah. Mom,
Iris is home!


1634
01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:22.336
Hi, Ma.

1635
01:18:24.337 --> 01:18:25.840
Do you need
anything?


1636
01:18:25.873 --> 01:18:27.975
No, no, no. Um,
can you just help Dad?


1637
01:18:28.008 --> 01:18:30.111
Oh, my God. He just can't
figure it out with the lights.


1638
01:18:30.143 --> 01:18:32.213
- Okay. I can do that. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.


1639
01:18:32.245 --> 01:18:33.513
Just let me know if you
need anything else.


1640
01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:35.283
Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?


1641
01:18:35.316 --> 01:18:36.584
No, no, no! It's okay!

1642
01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:38.085
You don't have to!

1643
01:18:38.119 --> 01:18:38.952
- Okay.
- Thank you!


1644
01:18:38.986 --> 01:18:41.923
Okay. You tell me if
you need anything.


1645
01:18:41.956 --> 01:18:43.357
- Yeah. Okay. I will.
- Okay. Okay.


1646
01:18:43.391 --> 01:18:46.460
- I'll see you later.
- Bye!


1647
01:18:46.494 --> 01:18:50.500
- Hi, Tita.
- Oh, hi!


1648
01:18:51.567 --> 01:18:53.236
Oh, Tita Baby and Tita
Edna, they're here.


1649
01:18:53.269 --> 01:18:54.437
They're making shanghai.

1650
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:55.605
Oh, okay.

1651
01:18:55.638 --> 01:18:56.973
Are you okay?

1652
01:18:57.005 --> 01:18:58.140
Yeah!

1653
01:18:58.174 --> 01:18:59.475
Hi, sweetie.

1654
01:18:59.507 --> 01:19:00.609
How are you?

1655
01:19:00.643 --> 01:19:01.612
- I'm good.
- Yeah?


1656
01:19:01.645 --> 01:19:03.881
Yes. Oh. Hi, Tita.

1657
01:19:03.913 --> 01:19:05.416
Iris.

1658
01:19:05.448 --> 01:19:06.482
Do you need
help with any lights?


1659
01:19:06.515 --> 01:19:08.384
Oh, it's okay. Um...

1660
01:19:10.453 --> 01:19:13.225
- Yeah. No. I forgot. Sorry.
- Aw.


1661
01:19:13.257 --> 01:19:15.025
Here. I'll give you
the key, anyway.


1662
01:19:15.058 --> 01:19:16.927
- Sorry.
- Yeah.


1663
01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:18.329
The aunts are
being so weird.


1664
01:19:18.363 --> 01:19:20.397
Like, they're being
so nice to me.


1665
01:19:20.431 --> 01:19:22.400
Why is that?

1666
01:19:22.432 --> 01:19:24.869
I'll tell you
honestly.


1667
01:19:29.909 --> 01:19:31.110
Simon left you.

1668
01:19:31.142 --> 01:19:32.477
How did you guys...

1669
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:35.548
A friend of
your Tita Flor, okay,


1670
01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.151
knows the family
in Morden.


1671
01:19:38.183 --> 01:19:42.521
Tita Flor told
us about it.


1672
01:19:42.554 --> 01:19:44.590
Why don't you see your
mom and apologize?


1673
01:19:44.624 --> 01:19:46.359
No, Pa!

1674
01:19:46.393 --> 01:19:50.198
I don't need to apologize to you
guys for the things that I do!


1675
01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:52.000
I'm so tired of
you guys telling me


1676
01:19:52.033 --> 01:19:53.201
that I'm always the
one that's fucking up!


1677
01:19:53.234 --> 01:19:54.669
- No, it's not!
- Pa!


1678
01:19:54.702 --> 01:19:57.272
Please! Why don't you
see your mom...


1679
01:19:57.305 --> 01:19:58.973
- No!
- ...and apologize?


1680
01:19:59.006 --> 01:20:00.275
- No!
- Why not?


1681
01:20:00.308 --> 01:20:02.444
You want me to
apologize to Mom


1682
01:20:02.476 --> 01:20:04.646
because I
fucked up again?


1683
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.149
You want me to give
that to her, Dad?


1684
01:20:07.181 --> 01:20:09.117
I don't want
to argue with you.


1685
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:12.120
Just see your mom
and apologize, right now.


1686
01:20:12.154 --> 01:20:16.192
Fine! You want me
to apologize to Mom?


1687
01:20:19.027 --> 01:20:20.530
I don't owe
you anything!


1688
01:20:20.562 --> 01:20:22.932
I don't need to apologize
to you for anything...


1689
01:20:22.966 --> 01:20:24.034
- Do you think...
- ...that's happening


1690
01:20:24.066 --> 01:20:25.269
- in my personal life!
- ...you know what you're saying?


1691
01:20:25.303 --> 01:20:27.338
I know exactly what I'm saying.

1692
01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:29.306
I am saying that I am
done with this bullshit


1693
01:20:29.339 --> 01:20:30.974
- between you and me.
- Now, you're telling me...


1694
01:20:31.008 --> 01:20:32.643
Okay. You don't get to tell me
what to do anymore, Mom!


1695
01:20:32.675 --> 01:20:34.044
- No.
- Listen!


1696
01:20:38.215 --> 01:20:41.452
In our family,
you put so much shame on us!


1697
01:20:41.486 --> 01:20:44.723
And that's what you make me feel
every fucking day of my life!


1698
01:20:44.755 --> 01:20:45.723
So, what happened
to Bong?


1699
01:20:45.756 --> 01:20:46.924
It doesn't matter
what happened to Bong, Ma!


1700
01:20:46.957 --> 01:20:49.228
- And then there's another guy?
- That is past! How can you...


1701
01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.563
And then you didn't
even tell anyone


1702
01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:51.597
that you went
there at Morden?


1703
01:20:51.631 --> 01:20:52.731
Because exactly this
is what's going to happen!


1704
01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:55.468
We're trying to improve... We're
trying to help you,


1705
01:20:55.501 --> 01:20:57.369
- your dad and I!
- And you're helping me by what?


1706
01:20:57.403 --> 01:20:59.172
- Yes! Exactly!
- You haven't even asked me


1707
01:20:59.204 --> 01:21:01.107
if I'm fine, Mom!

1708
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:03.643
You know my boyfriend
left me, right?


1709
01:21:03.677 --> 01:21:05.512
Did you ask me
if I'm okay?


1710
01:21:07.614 --> 01:21:12.119
You want to know why I
married Bong, Mom?


1711
01:21:12.151 --> 01:21:16.523
I married Bong to
make you guys happy.


1712
01:21:16.557 --> 01:21:18.526
- Because you always...
- I married him


1713
01:21:18.558 --> 01:21:21.362
because I thought it would
make the family happy.


1714
01:21:21.396 --> 01:21:22.530
It would bring us together

1715
01:21:22.562 --> 01:21:24.531
and for once, for once,

1716
01:21:24.565 --> 01:21:27.769
I don't feel
like I'm... I'm a cloud,


1717
01:21:27.803 --> 01:21:31.006
a dark fucking cloud that
just everyone looks down on.


1718
01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.176
Why can't you just get
someone like Justin?


1719
01:21:34.209 --> 01:21:37.614
You think Justin
is so perfect, don't you?


1720
01:21:37.646 --> 01:21:39.416
- Yeah!
- When that guy is a creep!


1721
01:21:39.448 --> 01:21:41.617
He tries to touch women in
the most inappropriate ways!


1722
01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:43.487
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Mom, he is a pervert!


1723
01:21:43.519 --> 01:21:45.221
- Come on.
- And you're making Agnes


1724
01:21:45.255 --> 01:21:47.623
- marry this man?
- I don't believe you.


1725
01:21:47.657 --> 01:21:50.294
Agnes is making the same mistake
as I did three years ago!


1726
01:21:50.327 --> 01:21:51.128
- No.
- It's going to ruin her!


1727
01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.096
I don't know what's
wrong with you.


1728
01:21:53.129 --> 01:21:57.167
It's going to ruin her, Mom,
the same way that it ruined me!


1729
01:22:01.306 --> 01:22:04.810
I would do anything, anything,

1730
01:22:04.843 --> 01:22:06.712
just to take back
everything that I did


1731
01:22:06.745 --> 01:22:10.783
and make this
all okay.


1732
01:22:12.316 --> 01:22:16.355
So can you come back and
work this out, please?


1733
01:23:37.243 --> 01:23:41.280
End of the line, pal.

1734
01:24:18.988 --> 01:24:20.423
Hey, man.

1735
01:24:20.456 --> 01:24:22.458
We're closed.

1736
01:24:25.796 --> 01:24:27.832
Yeah.

1737
01:25:25.961 --> 01:25:29.431
Simon!
You're home!


1738
01:25:29.463 --> 01:25:32.400
You... you're home!
How long have you been home?


1739
01:25:32.434 --> 01:25:34.035
Were you going to call me
if you were going to...


1740
01:25:34.069 --> 01:25:35.404
- I was trying...
- Okay.


1741
01:25:35.436 --> 01:25:36.839
- I was worried sick!
- Yeah, I know.


1742
01:25:36.873 --> 01:25:37.874
- And you...
- Look, I'm sorry.


1743
01:25:37.906 --> 01:25:38.941
And you left without
a coat, and...


1744
01:25:38.974 --> 01:25:40.877
- Yeah, I know I did.
- ...you left your stupid phone!


1745
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:41.845
- I know. I didn't think about it.
- I...


1746
01:25:41.878 --> 01:25:43.513
That's why I didn't
wear shoes or a coat,


1747
01:25:43.545 --> 01:25:45.382
because I
wasn't thinking, okay?


1748
01:25:45.414 --> 01:25:46.849
I wasn't. I didn't
think about it.


1749
01:25:46.883 --> 01:25:49.954
It's just a thing that I do,
and the cat's out of the bag.


1750
01:25:49.987 --> 01:25:51.956
That's a part of me,
and it's weird.


1751
01:25:51.988 --> 01:25:54.058
I know it is,
but I just feel


1752
01:25:54.090 --> 01:25:55.492
like I don't
have control over it,


1753
01:25:55.526 --> 01:25:57.028
because it's,
like, this thing


1754
01:25:57.061 --> 01:25:58.362
that I inherited
from my mom.


1755
01:25:58.394 --> 01:25:59.629
And I swear to God,
I'm working on it,


1756
01:25:59.662 --> 01:26:03.335
but sometimes, it's just really
hard to not... act like that.


1757
01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:06.671
And that's... Oh,
that's... not great.


1758
01:26:06.705 --> 01:26:10.643
And I'm sorry
if I scared you.


1759
01:26:13.679 --> 01:26:15.782
You did.

1760
01:26:16.949 --> 01:26:19.419
You just had me
so worried, okay? I...


1761
01:26:19.452 --> 01:26:21.320
I know.

1762
01:26:21.354 --> 01:26:25.392
You can't just leave and not
tell people where you're going.


1763
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.562
And we just had that big fight,
and I wasn't...


1764
01:26:29.596 --> 01:26:31.598
Hey.

1765
01:26:34.534 --> 01:26:37.037
Are you okay?

1766
01:26:37.071 --> 01:26:38.807
Yeah.

1767
01:26:58.894 --> 01:27:01.631
That's not fair.

1768
01:27:01.663 --> 01:27:03.132
I mean,

1769
01:27:03.166 --> 01:27:05.668
do you know what
it was like for me


1770
01:27:05.702 --> 01:27:08.605
to just be left there

1771
01:27:08.637 --> 01:27:10.873
at that stupid airport
after you had just told me


1772
01:27:10.907 --> 01:27:13.477
that we needed
to sow our wild oats?


1773
01:27:13.511 --> 01:27:16.047
And so I did.

1774
01:27:16.079 --> 01:27:17.180
Do you know what
it feels like


1775
01:27:17.214 --> 01:27:20.118
to just betray the one person
that you love the most


1776
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:22.753
and then just think that
it's completely fine?


1777
01:27:22.787 --> 01:27:24.622
- Look. I know. I know. I know.
- And I wasn't even sure


1778
01:27:24.654 --> 01:27:26.157
if you were going to
come home anymore,


1779
01:27:26.191 --> 01:27:29.128
and then you just...

1780
01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.762
- And then you leave again.
- Wait. Don't.


1781
01:27:30.795 --> 01:27:33.464
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You're right.


1782
01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:36.034
You're right. I fucked up.

1783
01:27:36.066 --> 01:27:40.106
It was my fault. It was my
fault. I made you...


1784
01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:44.076
- Please don't. Don't. I'm sorry.
- I didn't even know


1785
01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:47.479
if you were going to
come back anymore.


1786
01:27:47.513 --> 01:27:49.750
And then you leave again
and again and again.


1787
01:27:49.782 --> 01:27:51.451
Please, please, please,
please, please.


1788
01:27:51.484 --> 01:27:54.522
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1789
01:27:54.555 --> 01:27:55.856
I'm sorry.

1790
01:27:55.889 --> 01:27:57.591
I'm sorry.

1791
01:28:07.534 --> 01:28:09.837
Any more secrets
you want to get out?


1792
01:28:12.975 --> 01:28:14.509
Because now would
be the time.


1793
01:28:14.543 --> 01:28:16.779
I think it's your
turn, actually.


1794
01:28:16.811 --> 01:28:20.982
- Oh, my turn.
- Uh-huh.


1795
01:28:21.016 --> 01:28:24.755
Is there anything else you
wanted to tell me?


1796
01:28:24.787 --> 01:28:26.956
No.

1797
01:28:30.693 --> 01:28:33.563
Nothing at all, huh?

1798
01:28:35.831 --> 01:28:39.237
Not even from
our first date?


1799
01:28:39.269 --> 01:28:40.205
No.

1800
01:28:52.885 --> 01:28:55.521
Why won't
you just tell me?


1801
01:29:00.793 --> 01:29:01.795
I went to Morden.

1802
01:29:02.995 --> 01:29:05.231
I saw your house.

1803
01:29:05.265 --> 01:29:07.801
The girl next door told me.
I know about your dad.


1804
01:29:07.833 --> 01:29:09.970
I know your
mom left.


1805
01:29:13.673 --> 01:29:15.542
Why won't
you just tell me?


1806
01:29:23.983 --> 01:29:25.720
You're wrong.

1807
01:29:25.754 --> 01:29:27.289
Whatever you heard,
it's about someone else.


1808
01:29:27.322 --> 01:29:28.891
It isn't me.

1809
01:29:28.924 --> 01:29:31.993
No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.


1810
01:29:32.027 --> 01:29:34.029
No. That girl, Allison,

1811
01:29:34.062 --> 01:29:35.863
she's talking
about someone else.


1812
01:29:35.897 --> 01:29:37.534
It isn't me.

1813
01:29:37.567 --> 01:29:39.034
No, no, no. It's okay.

1814
01:29:39.068 --> 01:29:42.005
Just look at me.

1815
01:29:42.037 --> 01:29:44.907
I see you.

1816
01:29:46.742 --> 01:29:48.745
Oh.

1817
01:29:54.984 --> 01:29:56.819
Seriously?

1818
01:29:56.852 --> 01:29:59.023
You are lying
to my face, Simon,


1819
01:29:59.056 --> 01:30:01.626
and you don't get to
just walk away from me.


1820
01:30:01.659 --> 01:30:04.029
Stop it. I just gave
up so much for you, and...


1821
01:30:04.061 --> 01:30:05.796
Stop it! Hey!

1822
01:30:05.829 --> 01:30:09.300
Get... You're not
going anywhere. Stop!


1823
01:30:09.334 --> 01:30:12.572
I love you, okay?

1824
01:30:12.604 --> 01:30:16.642
And... But you
have to let me in.


1825
01:30:17.776 --> 01:30:20.613
You have to stop
locking me out


1826
01:30:20.646 --> 01:30:24.684
and just running away.

1827
01:30:26.019 --> 01:30:28.055
You won't...

1828
01:30:28.087 --> 01:30:31.724
You won't... you won't tell
me the truth about your family.


1829
01:30:31.758 --> 01:30:34.126
You won't fricking play
bass for me,


1830
01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.698
like I'm not good
enough for you.


1831
01:30:58.919 --> 01:31:02.992
Look, you can't do that
anymore, Simon, okay?


1832
01:31:03.026 --> 01:31:05.095
Your mom left,

1833
01:31:05.128 --> 01:31:06.830
and your dad...

1834
01:31:06.862 --> 01:31:10.299
All that stuff,
that's you.


1835
01:31:10.333 --> 01:31:14.371
But you can't just keep
lying to me about it.


1836
01:31:16.206 --> 01:31:17.107
One-night stands.

1837
01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:19.175
You can go back to
all of that bullshit,


1838
01:31:19.209 --> 01:31:22.179
but I... I want more.

1839
01:31:24.113 --> 01:31:27.853
No. I'm fucking done!

1840
01:31:27.885 --> 01:31:29.320
I... don't...

1841
01:31:29.354 --> 01:31:32.424
need it any... any more!

1842
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:05.727
Did you just have an
orgasm while dumping me?


1843
01:32:05.759 --> 01:32:07.762
Yes.

1844
01:32:16.404 --> 01:32:18.407
Yes.

1845
01:32:57.281 --> 01:32:59.217
- Appreciate the ride.
- No problem, man.


1846
01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:01.187
- If you just, like...
- That's what I do.


1847
01:33:01.219 --> 01:33:02.488
...wait outside,
it's going to be...


1848
01:33:02.522 --> 01:33:04.124
Oh, no, man.
You're going to a social.


1849
01:33:04.157 --> 01:33:06.359
I'm coming inside with
you. That's no question.


1850
01:33:06.392 --> 01:33:09.129
I... Well,
I mean, again,


1851
01:33:09.161 --> 01:33:10.162
I think it's
going to be, uh,


1852
01:33:10.197 --> 01:33:13.400
kind of a stealth in-and-out
sort of scenario.


1853
01:33:13.433 --> 01:33:16.436
No, I'm coming in.

1854
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:18.204
Alright.

1855
01:33:18.238 --> 01:33:20.441
You look good. It's a
bit of a different look


1856
01:33:20.474 --> 01:33:23.476
from the last time we,
uh... talked.


1857
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:24.546
- You think so?
- Yeah.


1858
01:33:24.578 --> 01:33:25.980
- You like it?
- Yeah, man.


1859
01:33:26.013 --> 01:33:28.150
Yeah. I think
this is more...


1860
01:33:28.182 --> 01:33:30.851
This is more me,
you know?


1861
01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:33.521
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

1862
01:33:39.829 --> 01:33:42.331
- Hey!
- Hi! How are you?


1863
01:33:42.364 --> 01:33:43.499
Good! Thank you
for coming!


1864
01:33:43.531 --> 01:33:45.133
Hey! Good
to see you, man.


1865
01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:47.536
How are you?

1866
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:49.840
I think we're out
of the...


1867
01:34:03.354 --> 01:34:05.156
- No dumplings?
- That one is karioka!


1868
01:34:05.188 --> 01:34:07.057
- Karioka.
- Karioka. Yeah. Karioka.


1869
01:34:07.090 --> 01:34:10.093
Do you want one?

1870
01:34:10.126 --> 01:34:11.295
Oh, you made it!

1871
01:34:11.328 --> 01:34:13.332
- Hey!
- Of course you did.


1872
01:34:13.364 --> 01:34:15.466
How are you?

1873
01:34:15.499 --> 01:34:17.269
Thanks again for helping
me out in Morden.


1874
01:34:17.301 --> 01:34:18.237
Of course, of course.

1875
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:20.973
Uh, it didn't work out
with Simon so well.


1876
01:34:21.006 --> 01:34:21.941
- That's too bad.
- It's okay.


1877
01:34:21.974 --> 01:34:24.109
I just have to do stuff,
but please have fun.

Twenty-eight, 29, 30, 31,

1882
01:34:38.124 --> 01:34:40.260
Hey, Iris.
How's it going?


1883
01:34:40.294 --> 01:34:41.495
- Hi.
- What the fuck are you doing?


1884
01:34:41.527 --> 01:34:43.297
- Oh, I'm sorry! Uh, I'm sorry!
- Are you serious?


1885
01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:45.032
- Yeah. I... I didn't mean to.
- We just talked about this!


1886
01:34:45.065 --> 01:34:46.032
- I know.
- She doesn't like it!


1887

I was just... I
know! I'm sorry!


1888

1889
01:34:48.402 --> 01:34:50.004

- Yes. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

were the band,

You couldn't have
just called me


1961
01:38:03.748 --> 01:38:06.584
if you wanted to play
your bass over the phone?


1962
01:38:06.616 --> 01:38:08.652

to fight for the band.

this right now.

meet you.

- No, no!


1970
01:38:30.276 --> 01:38:31.510
She thinks
you're sweet,


1971
01:38:31.544 --> 01:38:36.149
and... she
liked your song.

tone deaf, but...

1974

Uh... okay.

1975
01:38:49.564 --> 01:38:51.900
- Yeah. I'm really sorry.
- Yes, Simon. Okay. I know.


1976
01:38:51.932 --> 01:38:54.435
Literally everybody that
I know on this Earth


1977
01:38:54.468 --> 01:38:57.705
knows that
you're sorry.


1978

Yeah, okay.

1979
01:39:02.844 --> 01:39:06.882
Like, I still can't
believe you did that.
