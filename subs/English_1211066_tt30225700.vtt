00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.910
[Patryk] You ready?

4
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.630
Uh-huh, I think I've got it all.

5
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.150
[Patryk] Are you sure?
Got your plane ticket?


6
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.270
Patryk, I'm going to accept an award,

7
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.070
not see the guy who cheated on me.

8
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.150
[Patryk] No, I know.

9
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.510
Can't they just mail you the award?

10
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.230
[chuckles] It's... It's just really cool,
seeing all your dreams come true.


11
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.390
I know people are talking.

12
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.190
Well, who cares? Let them talk.
Gossip is all they do in Podhale.


13
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.670
Just ignore them.

14
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.390
[Kasia] I'll make sure
to call you every day.


15
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.070
[chuckles] Wow, really?
It's a different time zone.


16
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.150
To me, it makes no difference.

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.270
[laughs] Well... 
Got your return ticket?

18
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.190
[groans] How many times must I say it?
He won't show up.


19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.710
- [Patryk] Are you sure?
- [Kasia] Bob? Give it a rest.


20
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.966
Well, you've got the ticket right there.
Why don't you just make sure?


21
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.750
- Can we get going?
- You're the one that's stalling!


22
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.230
America isn't that far away! I mean,
it's only three days. I don't understand.


23
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.190
[groans] Three days?

24
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.750
[Kasia] It's a week, Patryk.
I'm only gone for a week. You'll survive.

34
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.670
[Patryk] Congratulations, gentlemen.

35
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.230
Second place is not bad at all.

36
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.390
Even third place makes it to the podium.
[laughs] You guys are lucky, though.


37
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.070
You won't stand a chance
against my Golden Arrow.


38
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.830
- Where would that arrow of yours be?
- [Patryk] In the repair shop.


39
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.270
In two weeks' time, you'll finally
get a chance to meet the true champion.


40
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.230
- And who's that?
- Me, of course! The new <i>gazda.</i>


41
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.190
You're not much of a <i>gazda</i>
without a woman.


42
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.990
You're funny. Very, very funny.

43
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.430
Come on, come on. 
This man is delusional.

44
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.110
- [Franek] So?
- Ah, don't worry.


45
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.910
They're good, but honestly,
they're all going down.


46
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.870
- [Franek laughs]
- Next time, I'll be champion.


47
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.950
Hell yeah!

48
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.590
Patryk, you know that you...

49
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.430
You can always count on me.

50
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.390
I know, Franek.

51
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.590
Always.

52
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.750
- I swear!
- [Patryk groans]

- [man 2] And where are they?


55
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.470
- [man 1] They're coming!
- [Jędruś] Of course they are. [laughs]


56
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.646
- [Wacuś] Hey!
- [Jędruś] Hey!


57
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.670
Look at him, driving that sleigh
like a true <i>gazda!</i> Yeah!


58
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.830
Oh, yeah. I don't know
if I'd go that far, to be fair. [laughs]


59
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.750
Wait. You're saying my Franek can't drive?

60
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.670
[chuckles] Well, he'll never win if that's
how he's gonna be holding the reins.


61
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.750
If he's gonna be driving the sleigh
like that to the baptism,


62
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.950
we'll need to bring in a coachman
from Morskie Oko. No doubt about it.


63
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.310
There's still time.

64
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.190
Will you reconsider it?

65
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.910
Save yourself and us from the shame.
You don't want to cancel the baptism.


66
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.470
I told you it's gonna be
Kasia and Patryk. Accept it!


67
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.790
[sighs]

68
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.670
- [man 1] Come here.
- No, keep your distance.


69
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.286
- [man 1] Come here!
- Keep your distance.


70
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.030
- Over here, my friend.
- No, no, no, I said keep your distance.


71
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.350
- Come on, Patryk.
- [Patryk] No, no. No. No. No, no, no.


72
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.550
- [man 1] Don't cry. Don't cry.
- I'm begging you, get off!


73
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.470
Really. Just let me go!
You'll poke my eye out. I don't like this.


74
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.990
It's starting now, huh? [chuckles]

75
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.630
What do you mean, it's starting?

76
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.550
I mean, look.
It seems like people are starting to talk.


77
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.910
- [Patryk] Stop! I don't need this.
- Have you heard anyone talking?


78
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.110
[Patryk] No, no, no.

79
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.310
Hi. Uh, praise the Lord.

80
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.590
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.


81
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.470
- [Patryk] All right, seriously...
- You'll find another woman!


82
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.430
Hey! Go away!
All right, I'm leaving. Let me go!


83
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.870
Well... [sniffs]

84
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.910
What's up with that baptism? Huh?

85
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.670
I don't know. What's up with it?

86
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.030
Um, I've heard that, uh,
it was getting canceled, no?


87
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.390
[tense music playing]

88
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.470
Well, so is it still happening then,
or is it not?


89
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.510
Uh, yeah. Yeah, why wouldn't it?
Baptism is still happening.


90
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.510
Well, I don't usually
follow gossip like this,


91
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.470
but they say Kasia went to America
to get back together with that Bob guy.


92
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.590
Yeah, well.

93
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.550
Oh, I get it now. 
You are canceling it.

94
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.550
You know what?
You were supposed to keep your mouth shut.


95
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.590
Have you talked? Have you?

96
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.190
- Whoa, what do you mean?
- Who else? You did talk!


97
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.470
- It was you!
- I talked?


98
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.390
Well, you've been yapping your head off!
Everybody could hear you.


99

[jaunty music playing]

[music stops]

101
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.590
- [man] Whose shack is that?
- [chuckles] Grandpa Jasiek's!


102
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.350
In the '70s, he used this place
to stash clothes and other goods


103
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.910
all the way from Austria.

104
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.150
Ah, a hustler's hideout. Great.

105
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.910
Oh, no, no, no. A smuggler's!

106
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.950
He then worked at NASA where he developed
a ground-breaking system for shuttles.


107
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.270
He figured out how to fly
using only two wires rather than three.


108
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.830
[laughs] After that,
his pension was killer.


109
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.550
A killer pension, huh?

110
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.430
I've seen a couple of estimates
for my pension.


111
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.030
It might just be
the thing to kill me.

112
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.510
Therefore, we need our own side hustle.

113
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.430
This place is perfect.

114
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.030
Not anymore.

115
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.350
- A bear came through.
- What bear? They're hibernating.


116
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.910
Uh, I guess it woke up.

117
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.950
[tense music playing]

118
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.630
Nah, it must've been a groundhog.
Don't freak out.


119
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.710
Grab those boxes.

120
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.750
- [tense music continues]
- [man exhales]


121
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.150
[Franek] Um, does Maryla know
about your new storehouse?


122
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.150
[man] She personally asked me to find it.

123
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.990
[Franek] What's wrong with the old one?

124
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.950
This is priceless cargo that wouldn't
have been safe in the old storehouse.


125
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.270
A Goral, plus a carnival, plus Litworówka.

126
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.870
- Get it?
- Mm, no.


127
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.950
Mm, yes

128
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.230
[sighs] At home, would you let your
newborn baby anywhere near a matchbook?


129
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.710
- Well, no.
- See? Grab it.


130
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.350
Hey, hey!

131
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.990
- It's starting.
- What are you talking about?


132
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.230
[line ringing]

133
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.070
Wacuś, pick up!

134
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.390
There's no point in calling. This morning
he took a customer cross-country skiing.


135
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.310
- Hmm. Customer, huh? I know the type.
- [Patryk laughs]


136
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.310
Leave any of you alone for a moment
and your pants go flying.


137
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.990
- [Patryk laughs]
- I'll find the weasel.


138
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.470
Did Kasia call you?

139
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.750
She texted me
as soon as the plane touched down.


140
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.470
- That's it?
- Yup.


141
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.270
- That's enough.
- So it's starting.


142
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.190
What? What's starting? She's busy.

143
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.190
Oh, no kidding.

144
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.790
Yeah. Numerous meetings,
receiving the award.


145
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.830
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
She couldn't come up with a better alibi?


146
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.550
- What happens if she slips up?
- She won't slip up.


147
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.470
America is another universe.
All the women lose their marbles.


148
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.310
But don't worry, dear brother.
If she doesn't call, you do it.


149
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.790
Oh, leave me alone, man!

150
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.630
Be careful. Don't be an idiot. Call!

151
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.390
[Patryk chuckling]
Now, that is beautiful!


152
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.310
- When's it ready?
- [man 1] It'll be ready when it's ready.


153
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.430
[Patryk] Ah.

154
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.750
- Too bad it won't run.
- What do you mean it won't run?


155
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.790
It'll run in the couples' sleigh race.

156
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:44.590
Uh, could you do me a favor and, uh,
tune up the sleigh before the race, huh?


157
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.030
Listen,

158
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.870
for private use, maybe I could,

159
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.070
but for the couples' race? Illegal.

160
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.150
[Patryk groans]

161
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.790
[jaunty music playing]

162
00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.030
[man 1] Hmm.

163
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.110
[jaunty music continues]

164
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.830
- [both] Easy-peasy!
- [Patryk laughs]


165
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.430
[man 2] Are you selling your sleigh?

166
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.590
'Cause if you are,
then I'd buy it from you.


167
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.910
Seems to me like she's not gonna call.

168
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.790
- That's what I've heard.
- [man 2 laughs]


169
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.750
- No idea what you're talking about.
- They're all the same.


170
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.830
Promises on promises...

171
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:27.910
[groans]

172
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.670
So, how much for it, huh?

173
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.750
- Huh?
- When's it ready?


174
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.710
It'll be ready when it's ready.

175
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.790
Yeah. Got it?

176
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.270
I got you.

177
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.750
[jaunty music continues]

178
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.950
I feel bad for the guy.

179
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.590
Hasn't been a year and she's already
made him a cuckold, huh?


180
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.270
[jaunty music continues]

181
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.870
[sighs]

182
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.430
[sighs]

183
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.870
[line ringing]

184
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.950
[gentle music playing]

185
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.430
[cell phone ringing]

186
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.870
[cell phone continues to ring]

187
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.870
Hello, Patryk. 
Is there something wrong?

188
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:28.950
[Patryk] <i>Not at all.</i>

189
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.670
Except that I spend my days
sitting at home,


190
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.390
missing you so bad,
stuffing my face with chips,


191
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:39.750
<i>binge-watching all the</i> 365 Days <i>movies
to see if she comes back to him or not.</i>


192
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.830
She will.

193
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.390
- [Patryk] <i>You've watched it?</i>
- I just know babe. Hey, listen to me.


194
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.270
It's 5:00 in the morning.

195
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.270
<i>Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I forgot. Mm. Ah...</i>

196
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.630
Well, it's just you haven't called me,
so I thought that... that...


197
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.150
[Kasia] <i>That you'd check up on me?</i>

198
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.470
But you trust me.

199
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.070
[Patryk] <i>Um, well... Well, I do.</i>

200
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.630
O-of course. You know that I trust you.

201
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.230
[Kasia] <i>Hey,</i> gazda,

202
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.950
shouldn't you be at work right about now?

203
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.110
And I should be sleeping.

204
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.390
Because they invited me on a real TV show,
so I have to get some rest.


205
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.470
Knock 'em dead, honey.
[chuckles awkwardly]


206
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.390
I have to go. Bye. Bye!

207
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.670
Infant.

208
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.990
[Wacuś laughs]

209
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.910
And right, and left, and right.

210
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.350
And together now. Together.

211
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.950
Just a little warm-up
before the White Bear Ball.


212
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.430
And again. Yay! And right. And right.
And again. Good job. Just like that.


213
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.790
I'm waiting for you.

214
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.670
[Wacuś] Again, again. 
And push, and push.

215
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.910
[Jędruś] Hurry, hurry.

216
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.630
Please excuse me, Monica.
I've got to talk to my colleague.


217
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.430
Do you have to act like that?
Where are your manners? My goodness.


218
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.110
Is shaking your ass, for tourist girls
considered proper manners?


219
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.390
Hey, I always try to face the customer.

220
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.350
That's a little hard to do
when you're dressed like that!


221
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.190
There's an issue with the baptism.

222
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.190
Didn't I tell you? That sister of yours
is just like a live grenade.


223
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.846
- It's Patryk!
- What's the problem, huh?


224
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.630
- He needs supervision.
- Why?


225
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.390
Women are flocking to him. They sense
he's free, and he hasn't called her.


226
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.430
[scoffs] And why would he call her?

227
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.190
I'm worried he'll go crazy all over again.

228
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.430
Of course he'll go crazy.

229
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.230
He's an outsider. He put on our clothes,
but he sure doesn't have Goral honor.


230
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.310
Whoa, hold it! 
That's my brother-in-law.

231
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.430
Will you help me out?

232
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.750
Can this wait for a bit?

233
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.030
I have to finish the course
and after that I am at your disposal.


234
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.350
Forgive us, miss.
I won't hold my friend any longer.


235
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.390
Thank you for your understanding.

236
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.430
Those are manners.

237
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.510
[Wacuś] Monica, come here, please.

238
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.790
We're just gonna head that way.

239
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.070
- Bye. See ya.
- Okay.


240
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.070
- Bye.
- Okay right, and now left.


241
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.430
One and two, and one.

242
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.030
And one, and two.

243
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.110
And one, and two.

244
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.710
[tranquil music playing]

245
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.790
[man] Come on, faster!

246
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.030
[man laughs]

247
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.310
Give me a kiss!

248
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.150
Stilo is officially completed.

249
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.910
But you said it
was gonna be more extreme.

250
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.710
[laughs] Hey, I mean,
at least it wasn't a 30-meter wave, huh?


251
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.726
- Actually, Wera...
- [Wera] I know, I know, I know.


252
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.590
First your ski tour in the mountains,
and then we go to Portugal.


253
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.990
We can skip the mountains.

254
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.230
- All right, let's go.
- Wait!


255
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.430
No. First, a little surprise.

256
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.310
[groans] I hate surprises.

257
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.790
- You'll like this one. Come on! Let's go.
- [Wera] All right.


258
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.870
Okay.

259
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.870
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.


260
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.270
I'm not really liking this, Kacper.

261
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.790
- [Kacper grumbles]
- Oh?


262
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.550
Wanna race? Huh?

263
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.830
- Okay!
- [Kacper] Oh, you!


264
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:23.910
[Wera laughs]

265
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.830
[both laugh]

266
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:30.990
[Wera squeals]

267
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.070
I win!

268
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.470
Oh wow. How?

269
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.190
[exhales]

270
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.430
[Wera laughs]

271
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.870
- [Kacper] Hmm?
- [Wera laughs]


272
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.990
- So? You like?
- [laughs] No.


273
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.150
- For real?
- I'm kidding. [giggles]


274
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.790
Wera, just don't laugh,
this is a big question.


275
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.310
[giggles] Okay, you almost got me there.

276
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.646
I've never been...
No, no, no, I've never been more serious.


277
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.470
- Kacper...
- Will you marry me?


278
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.630
Are you kidding me?

279
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.310
Seriously?

280
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.310
[Kacper] Hmm?

281
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.390
[gentle music playing]

282
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.590
Yes. [laughs]

283
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.350
- I think we should do it our way.
- [Kacper chuckles]


284
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.150
Just the two of us and some sad little
clerk who doesn't speak the same language.


285
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.886
- [Kacper chuckles]
- Somewhere on the road.


286
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.150
Maybe in Portugal? Huh?

287
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.470
Yeah, we'll see.

288
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.070
[Wera] We'll see?

289
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.990
Huh? We're going, right?

290
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.870
Nazaré, our dream.

291
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.030
The biggest wave in the world.
When is that again? In February.


292
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.150
Next year.

293
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.230
You're kidding.

294
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.750
Oh no, Kacper, you took it.

295
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.510
Hey, that job was a pretty big deal.
It's a huge opportunity.


296
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.750
[Wera] For us?

297
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.710
Kacper, for us?

298
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.310
Unbelievable.

299
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.510
So, what am I supposed to do then?

300
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.670
Sit in that scrap of rusty metal
down there and twiddle my thumbs, huh?


301
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.110
- Wera, listen to me.
- No, Kacper.


302
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:06.990
- No.
- Hey, but just wait!


303
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.310
- Wera! Wera!

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.150
- Hey, give me that.
- Get off!


608
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.030
- And it doesn't sound like that to me.
- [Patryk] She's talking nonsense!


609
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.950
And I'm not lying. 
Unlike others.

610
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.030
Wow, man.

611
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.190
Why... Why did you
say he wouldn't be there?

612
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.430
Bob. And he sure was.

613
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.310
What the hell are you saying?

614
00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:33.430
Everyone told me it would end badly.
But no, I said, "Let her go, let her go."


615
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.830
"I know I can trust my wife."

616
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.750
"I believe her."

617
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.310
Well, now half of Podhale
thinks I'm a cuckold.


618
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.350
Half of Podhale thinks you're a cuckold?
What are you talking about?


619
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.350
- Why are you back so soon?
- They kicked me out!


620
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.710
Come on, Kasia, you can do better
than that. Why didn't you call me?


621
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.990
I didn't have my phone on me.

622
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.870
- In bed with Bob.
- Huh?


623
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.110
[Wera] Board.

624
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.550
- Backpack.
- Hey!


625
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.830
Ugh, there's some more of your stuff here.

626
00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.510
Ugh, garbage from Indonesia.
I hated that stupid trip.


627
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.190
- Come on, it was your idea!
- [Wera] Here's your mask. Here!


628
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.110
- Laptop.
- Well...


629
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.070
Your gloves. There.

630
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:11.350
- [Kacper] Be careful please.
- I really can't.


631
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.670
That's all. And forget about the RV.

632
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.430
It won't get you anywhere.
Unless maybe it gets towed.


633
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.430
- What now? Are you just gonna stay here?
- [Wera] Why not?


634
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.470
Fantastic people, wonderful place. What
more could you want? Time to settle down.


635
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.870
Oh, now you want to. Hey!

636
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.150
[Kasia] Are you moving out?

637
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.430
No. It's my house.

638
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.070
Ah, you'll be living with the woman
who cheated on you, huh?


639
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.230
Come on, man.
Half of Podhale will be laughing at you.


640
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.950
Now you're stealing my lines.

641
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.230
Why don't you stay
with your little friend, huh?


642
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.550
My friend? That's right.
Right. With my friend, exactly!


643
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.630
In the RV.

644
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.110
Sounds good. I'll help.
I'll hold the door.


645
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.310
[Patryk] Great. 
Thank you very much.

646
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:05.230
If you want to stay, then stay. But I'll
stay as well until you decide to listen.


647
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.510
And where are you going to live, hm?

648
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.910
- Under a bridge?
- There are no bridges close by.


649
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.510
But there is accommodation.

650
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.390
And a place just freed up, right, <i>gazda?</i>

651
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.550
- Where's my tent?
- The basement.


652
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.030
Come on in! Make yourself comfortable.

653
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.230
[light flute music playing]

654
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.710
- Let me help.
- Thank you.


655
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.230
Don't sleep in my bed.

656
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.270
[jaunty music playing]

657
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.710
[music stops]

658
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.510
I'm really sorry for this mess.

659
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.070
It's okay.

660
00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.030
I'm happy to try to talk to her.

661
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.510
In Podhale, we handle these things
a little differently.


662
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.910
You know it's supposed to be -20 tonight?

663
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.030
Eh. I've slept in worse places.

664
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.430
As you wish.
If you freeze, you won't fix anything.


665
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.110
Right, right.

666
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.990
[Patryk sighs]

667
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.310
[Kasia] Sleep downstairs, don't walk
around the house, the bathroom's there.


668
00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.910
Breakfast is at 7:00.
If you're not up, make it yourself.


669
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.630
[Kacper] Thank you.

670
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.150
[Kasia] Sure.

671
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.990
- I don't think he slept with her.
- Are you sure about that?


672
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.670
- I know him.
- Hmm.


673
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.430
I think.

674
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.110
So, uh, what's going on?

675
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.190
He doesn't trust me anymore
and he won't let me explain anything.


676
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.950
Welcome to the club.

677
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.030
Oh wow, what did you do to her?

678
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.350
Nothing. I proposed to her.

679
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.790
Are you an idiot,
or do you do extreme sports?


680
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.430
N... no. I just wanted
to build a life for us.


681
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:22.950
[Kasia coughs]

682
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.030
So you're an idiot.

683
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.990
Hey, come on now.

684
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.950
If she heard me out,
it would all be okay.

685
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.270
[sighs] Welcome to the club.

686
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.590
[suspenseful music playing]

687
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.310
You see him? That Bob guy?

688
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.190
He came from America in an RV.

689
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.190
But he looks different.
He doesn't look like himself.


690
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.710
He's skinny like a twig.

691
00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.670
- I don't think that's him.
- What do you mean?


692
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.750
Maybe he had plastic surgery.

693
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.430
In America, it's a very common decision,
getting plastic surgery.


694
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.270
What's that?

695
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.390
Kale. Want some?

696
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:22.190
It regulates cholesterol, hmm,
and raises your immunity.


697
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.270
Jesus Christ.

698
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.710
Hell will freeze over
before I start drinking blended cabbage.


699
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.950
If it's not him, then who is it?

700
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.990
[Wacuś] Oh, Some third guy.

701
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:41.270
Your sister is unstable. [chuckles]
Just like your brother-in-law.


702
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:48.030
Ha! I'm telling you,
they're gonna live like this now.


703
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.310
Polyamorously.

704
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:50.790
It's a thing now, buddy.

705
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.950
- The offer is still on the table.
- [Jędruś sighs]


706
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.630
My cousin from Twardorzeczka
can take Karolek to his baptism.


707
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.470
Not Kasia and Patryk.

708
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.470
It's a good, old-fashioned,
traditional Goral family.


709
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.910
Over my dead body.
No cousins from Twardorzeczka.


710
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.790
In a week, all of
this will be sorted out.

711
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.350
[sighs] There is not gonna be
anything left in a week.


712
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.750
Watch out, watch out! Hide!

713
00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.270
He didn't let me explain
and judged me immediately.


714
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.990
But did you tell that Bob guy
to go to hell?


715
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.230
Come on, an entire SWAT team
came for my throat.


716
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.870
SWAT team? For one woman?

717
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.326
- [Kasia] Yeah.
- [Maryla] Oh, Kasia.


718
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:32.390
They closed off the entire floor.
There were police dogs searching the room.


719
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.350
An armed escort led me out of there.

720
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.590
Jagoda, the entire street
was blocked with police cars.


721
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.630
- Everywhere you look, police cars.
- The entire street was blocked?


722
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.750
They pushed me into a car,
took me to the airport,


723
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:46.030
hurled me on to an airplane
and off I went.


724
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.190
The FBI, the CIA,
the entire United States against Kasia!


725
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.190
Oh, give it a rest.

726
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.270
[scoffs] You don't believe me?

727
00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.790
No, Kasia, we believe you. We do.

728
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.750
Okay, we believe you. Yeah.

729
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.830
But the thing is, my sweetheart,
you could have called.


730
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:06.910
- [exhales] My phone got stolen.
- Yeah.


731
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.110
Oh, Kasia, this is all too much.

732
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.830
- You don't believe me!
- I'm telling you, <i>we</i> believe you.


733
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.150
But the men will never believe you.

734
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.710
You know, the air's pretty thin
all the way up here in the mountains,


735
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.710
so their brains are smaller and slower.

736
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.950
- They've lost a few marbles!
- Such is life. Let's drink.


737
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.030
No, not you.

738
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.350
Okay. Things will work out.

[Kasia and Maryla exhale]

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:41.310
Buddy, leave it. 
You'll hurt yourself.

741
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.510
- I'm already in pain, my guy, don't worry.
- Don't mess with the wood.


742
00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:48.030
Why? Ah, 'cause it's yours?

743
00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:50.150
- That's right.
- [Kacper] Oh.


744
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.550
Give it here. I can't stand it.
Don't wave it like it's a baseball bat.


745

[Patryk grunts]

746
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.550
Wow.

747
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:00.150
- Yeah. Years of practice.
- I can see.


748
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.990
- Where'd you practice?
- Taiga, tundra, Siberia.


749
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.990
You probably wouldn't know.
Only men go there.


750
00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:11.270
Now you just watch the lumberjack
do his thing.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:15.950
[Patryk] Uh...

753
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:18.390
All right. [grunts]

754
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.550
All right.

755
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.470
- It's... It's not balanced right.
- Yeah? May I?

[tense music playing]

918
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:56.990
What's going in there?

919
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:59.030
Lomilomi.

920
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:04.110
What?

921
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.670
Massage of the loving hands.

922
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:09.150
He's a master at those.

923
00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:11.670
Sexaholic.

924
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:14.870
Is it pleasant?

925
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:16.630
[Wera] Mm-hmm. Very.

926
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:19.830
- There's no such massage.
- Yeah, there is.


927
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:21.990
He learned it in Hawaii.

928
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:25.710
Unfortunately, any woman
melts at his touch.


929
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.430
- How is it? Everything okay?
- [Kasia] Mm-hmm.


930
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:34.190
I'll melt his face off.

- Enough.
- But... but...


934
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:10.350
It's great. Excellent massage.

935
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.510
But I haven't even started.

[jaunty music playing]

937
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:22.310
Oh, well. Worst case,
we postpone the baptism.


938
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.230
[scoffs] Why would you?

939
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:27.190
Just because my life fell apart
doesn't mean yours has to.


940
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:29.710
- [Maryla] Hey, Kasia.
- [Kasia sighs]


941
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.110
Are you just gonna
let Patryk go like that?


942
00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:34.190
He's a good man.

943
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.070
And for a surfer?

944
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:37.710
Come on, back off!

945
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:41.510
Well, he's no Belmondo,
but they say he's good with his hands.


946
00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.710
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Please, he's still just a kid.


947
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.246
- He's so talented!
- How do you know?


948
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.910
I just know! I may be a new mom,
but I've got a lot of life left to live.


949
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:50.550
Hey, mother, mother, watch it.

950
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:52.430
He's not your type at all. Mine either.

951
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:56.110
But I have heard one touch of his
makes a woman go wild.


952
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.350
Not me. I'm too strong.

953
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.710
- Hey, Kasia.
- Yeah?


954
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:05.630
I think you should
seriously think this over.


955
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.830
What am I supposed to think over?

956
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:10.470
It's been going on too long. Too long!

957
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.230
Everyone knows you're as stubborn
as a mule.


958
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:17.230
- [Kasia sighs]
- Patryk is no better. That's obvious.


959
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.790
But pulling those outsider kids
into your fight is just so...


960
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:23.230
I'm pulling them?

961
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:24.670
- Oh no?
- Patryk started it.


962
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.550
I actually want to help them.

963
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:27.630
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


964
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.670
How?

965
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.070
Hey, is that, uh,
board of yours any good or...?


966
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.070
Probably better than your skis.

967
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:46.870
Wanna find that out?

968
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:52.830
Right now? Or do you wanna
wait for an audience?


969
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:53.910
Now.

970
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:55.550
Just the two of us.

Well, we've gotta walk.

975
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.510
- Just a few meters.
- Mm-hmm?


976
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:33.230
- Maybe more.
- Maybe more?


977
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.670
Do you mean a kilometer? Or a few?

978

[chuckles] Should I call a helicopter?

979
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.470
What's with the board?

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:54.350
Are you gonna wobble up there?

You okay?

Why? Are you worried?

Of course not. 
Are you kidding?

- [Kacper] No. No.

so I couldn't tell him no.

- Come on, Wera.

What happens next?
You'll kill yourself with axes?

It's beautiful.

1039
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:47.310
It was, before you went
and ruined everything.


1040
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:50.350
Wera, I'm not finished.
It was just one of the options.


1041
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:53.430
- I haven't given them an answer.
- [Patryk] Do they remind you of anyone?

[somber music playing]

Us?

- Wera, we just had to talk it over a bit.

- But you ran away.
- Hmm.


1047
01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:18.390
It was always an uphill battle
for us. You know?


1048
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:19.950
Always.

It always does, you'll see.
They won't do anything on their own now.


1058
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.070
They're angrily running in circles.

Ah. Silly little things.

are up to no good

That's what I'm afraid of too!

I don't believe it!

Saints give me patience.
Saints give me patience!


1065
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:34.550
Because if I lose my nerve, Holy Mother
of Jesus herself won't stop me.


1066
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:35.870
I'll tear him apart!

1067
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:37.550
I'll tear him in half, skin him alive,

1068
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.190
take him out to the forest
and throw him to the wolves!

That damn weasel. 
He'll pay for this!

1070

I'm calling him.

1224
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.510
I haven't slept with Kacper.

1225
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:07.950
So what's this all about then?

1226
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:11.350
The man I love thinks I'm deceitful.

1227
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:12.550
[Wera] Mm.

1228
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.630
Patryk thinks the world of you.
That's why he's losing it.


1229
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:21.590
And Kacper wants
to change himself for you.


1230
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:24.230
- You know what that means?
- Yes.


1231
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:25.750
- [both chuckle]
- Oh please.


1232
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:29.190
I'm the master of screwing everybody over.

1233
01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:33.110
Sometimes we need to let go.

1234
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:34.950
[Wera] Hmm.

1235
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:37.630
You don't always have to be right.

1236
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:46.190
Did you check the starter?
It should be... Oh, there.


1237
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:51.190
Don't lecture me on starters.
I was born with that knowledge.


1238
01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:54.566
- But you haven't looked in here too often.
- [Kacper] Mm-hmm.


1239
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:55.590
Hold this for me.

1240
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:57.590
[tense music playing]

1241
01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.630
Listen, if you think
Kasia and I did anything...


1242
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.710
Come on, man, she's out of your league.

1243
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:05.430
Mm. And Wera's out of yours.

1244
01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:07.190
Oh crap!

1245
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:12.350
- It's nice.
- Right?


1246
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:14.350
- Old-school.
- Thanks.


1247
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:15.870
[both chuckle]

1248
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.870
- Have you ever even touched the starter?
- Not that long ago, but...


1249
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:23.350
I've got repair footage on my laptop.
I'll bring it here.


1250
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:27.550
- And the original wrench should be inside.
- Well, then, go. Quickly, hurry, hurry.


1251
01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:30.150
[tense music continues]

[music stops]

1253
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:36.150
[Jagoda] Did you make up
or kill each other?


1254
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:38.830
[Maryla] Did you make up?

1255
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.230
[Jagoda] I'm not hearing anything.

1256
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:43.830
Come on! Did you make up
or kill each other?


1257
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:45.190
Yeah, yeah, we made up.

1258
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.270
Ha! See? Told you. 
It works every time.

1259
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:49.550
- So let's open up.
- Yeah.


1260
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.190
Oh, um, did you send the video?

1261
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:53.486
- Yeah, I did it from an anonymous account.
- That's great.


1262
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:56.230
Thank your American friend
for arranging it. Come on, get 'em out.


1263
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:58.190
If I hadn't set him up,
he wouldn't have helped.


1264
01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.550
- Stop talking. Open up!
- Maryla, it was no big... [sighs]


1265
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:05.790
- [Kasia] There.
- There!


1266
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:09.510
- [Kasia] End of captivity.
- There you go, girls! [laughs]


1267
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:12.590
- Can we go now?
- Where? Where? We've got work to do!


1268
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:16.030
If you didn't argue so much, you wouldn't
have had to stay in there so long.


1269
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:18.710
[Maryla] Stop talking. Get to work.

1270
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:21.270
And remember,

1271
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:22.870
above everything else,

1272
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:26.150

divided we fall.

1274
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:30.590
Well, let's drink to unity
and a job well done.


1275
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:31.670
Not you.

There!

I forgive you.

Holy crap.

You don't say anything to anyone
and we won't either.

not tell Maryla a single thing.

In the morning, there'll be nothing here,
including that contraband of yours.

That's our mutual solution.

1368
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:42.190
But my crime isn't as punishable
as your crime.


1369
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:43.990
That's according to the criminal code.

What crime are you talking about?
Jędruś, do you see any crime around here?

Where?

1372

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:56.910
- That's how it went!
- Really?


1378
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:58.990
[both laugh]

1379
01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:00.070
[music fades]

1380
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:02.990
Okay, I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1381
01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:04.670
Wanna come in?

1382
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:08.070
Ah, no thanks.
I'll talk to him in the morning.


1383
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:09.910
[Wera chuckles]

1384
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:11.750
[Kasia] Wera?

1385
01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:14.670
Thanks.

1386
01:20:19.630 --> 01:20:20.830
[Wera] I'm coming in!

1387
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:26.950
[cell phone rings]

1388
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:28.990
Why did Kacper leave his phone here?

1389
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:31.790
[Wera] That's why he's not picking up.

1390
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:37.110
Patryk isn't picking up either.

1391
01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.910
[exhales] Maybe they're off
to the mountains again?


1392
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:41.670
No, it's the day of the race.

1393
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:46.110
- Maybe they went together?
- Together? Nah, come on.


1394
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:47.830
The sleigh.

1395
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:49.670
[dramatic music playing]

1396
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:53.110
Well...

1397
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:56.030
[Kasia] I know
who we need to ask. Let's go.


1398
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:57.870
[dramatic music continues]

1399
01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:03.150
[men strain]

1400
01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:09.830
[Kacper yells]

1401
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:13.790
- [Patryk] Chill out!
- [Kacper shouts]


1402
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:16.550
[Kacper yells] What the hell was that?

1403
01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:18.390
[Patryk grunts]

1404
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:23.590
A Goral kidnapping.
Welcome to the country.


1405
01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:24.830
Enjoy yourself.

1406
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:27.870
Hey, you're just gonna
leave me here to die? Untie me!


1407
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:30.470
[Patryk grunts]

1408
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:36.310
Yeah.

1409
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.870
Yeah. Could you chase it off
with a sausage somehow?


1410
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:42.230
All right. We've got a problem.

1411
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:45.630
- What are you talking about?
- Um, we gotta go to the shack.


1412
01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:48.790
Włodek, I told you last night
that everything's set. Don't panic.


1413
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:51.510
A bear came down from the mountain.
They're closing off the valley.


1414
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:55.270
If it came down, mm,
it will walk around and go away.


1415
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:56.350
[Kasia] Who came down?

1416
01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:00.510
Uh... [sighs]

1417
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:04.870
[Patryk] Drink. 
It'll warm you up.

1418
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:09.390
[exhales] Are you all completely insane?
Do you not have enough oxygen out here?


1419
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:16.030
Dude, you've got a phone?
You should've called for help immediately.


1420
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:17.750
I was tied up, remember?

1421
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:21.710
Crap. Kasia called me, like, ten times.

1422
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:24.070
So, were they here or were they not?

1423
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:27.790
Maybe they were, maybe they weren't.

1424
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:31.550
W... what am I,
a news station or something?


1425
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:35.030
Uh, maybe they're at the parade, huh?

1426
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:36.390
[growling]

1427
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:39.230
- [Kacper] What was that?
- [Patryk] Probably a groundhog.


1428
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:43.710
[growling]

1429
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:45.590
[Kacper] Groundhog? It's a bear!

1430
01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.030
[thudding on window]

1431
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.030
[tense music playing]

1432
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:51.990
- Hey, hey, hey! Let's get out of here!
- Shush.


1433
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.470
[music fades]

1434
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:57.110
Yeah.

1435
01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:00.230
That's a very good idea. Hmm?

1436
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:04.030
A bear runs at 60 kilometers an hour.

1437
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:06.510
Can you run at 70 kilometers an hour?

1438
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:07.950
[Kacper] Mm-mm.

1439
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:09.310
Then chill out.

1440
01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:10.950
[bear roars]

1441
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:12.270
[tense music playing]

1442
01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:16.190
What are you doing?

1443
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:20.350
I'm googling how to defeat it.

1444
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.950
- [Kacper screams]
- [bear growls]


1445
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:24.030
[Maryla] Hey!

1446
01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:26.270
My Litworówka.

1447
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:29.230
Was that all your doing? Huh?

1448
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:33.670
Because some businessmen
from the Czech Republic


1449
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:35.470
came to pick up the goods.

1450
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:37.710
Excuse me, uh, what goods?

1451
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:40.390
Oh, you're asking me? 
You don't know?

1452
01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:45.110
Gentlemen, I can assure you
that no matter what happens,


1453
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:48.470
you will get the goods that were promised.

1454
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.390
But I'm afraid
there will be an extra charge.


1455
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:52.870
[tense music playing]

1456
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:54.950
[muffled shouting]

1457
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:12.470
[spits] Are you completely insane?
Setting strangers against your own family?


1458
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:14.270
Where's Patryk and Kacper? Talk!

1459
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:19.230
I don't know. Sister, Kasia,
free your brother this instant or I sw...


1460
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:20.790
[Jędruś mumbles]

1461
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:22.910
Sweetheart,

1462
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:25.390
we did it all for you, I promise!

1463
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:27.230
Are you serious, Dad? 
What was for us?

1464
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:28.750
[Wacuś] Everything. Everything!

1465
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:31.030
- Now him!
- [Wacuś moans]


1466
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:35.470
It wasn't me. They are the ones who
left people to be eaten by wild animals!


1467
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:36.870
- [entry bell rings]
- Where?


1468
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:40.310
In Grandpa Jasiek's shack.

1469
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:42.910
If it comes up to you,
don't look it in the eye.


1470
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:45.590
Or... Or... Or what?
If you look, you'll fall in love?


1471
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:48.990
- Do you have any weapons?
- [Patryk] I've got a bear repellant spray.


1472
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:51.310
- [Kacper] Take it out!
- [Patryk] I left it at home.


1473
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:54.230
"Talk in a calm tone of voice.
Hide behind a tree."


1474
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:55.590
"Bears have very poor eyesight."

1475
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:59.350
"If there are no trees,
show it that you're human?"


1476
01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:01.470
- Who writes these things?
- [Kacper yelps]


1477
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:03.550
[dramatic music playing]

1478
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.510
- [Wera] Kacper!
- [Kasia] Sh! Shush.


1479
01:25:31.150 --> 01:25:32.150
Come on.

1480
01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.670
[tense music playing]

1481
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:02.030
[music fades]

01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:08.990
[tense music playing]

1483
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.750
[music fades]

1484
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:18.390
[whispers] Is it gone?

1485
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:21.350
[Kasia exhales]

1486
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:25.350
[gentle music playing]

1487
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.830
[Kacper] You really came down
from the mountain to save me?


1488
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:31.710
No. Kasia gave me a lift.

1489
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:33.870
- [both chuckle]
- [Kacper] Damn.


1490
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:35.470
I love you.

1491
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:37.510
[gentle music continues]

1492
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:47.790
I haven't slept with either him or Bob,
or anyone else.


1493
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.030
Do you believe me?

1494
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:51.390
Yeah.

1495
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:53.710
[gentle music continues]

1496
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:55.470
And I promise I didn't sleep with Wera.

1497
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:57.390
I know.

1498
01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:00.070
Do you forgive me?

1499
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:03.230
[gentle music continues]

1500
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:08.310
[chuckles] You've met your match, huh?

1501
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.190
[both chuckle]

1502
01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:13.230
[gentle music continues]

1503
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.990
[music fades]

1504
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:25.710
[man] Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1505
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:30.670
Hmm. [chuckles] Sweet thing.

1506
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:35.910
Well, what do you think?

1507
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:38.110
Golden Arrow. Beautiful, huh?

1508
01:27:38.190 --> 01:27:40.790
Beautiful. But will it hold up, <i>gazda?</i>

1509
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:44.350
It'll run, it'll run. Don't worry,
gentlemen. I'll be taking the gold.


1510
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:46.270
- We'll see.
- We'll see.


1511
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:47.910
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1512
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:50.886
Before you talk a big game, you better
put your money where your mouth is.


1513
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:54.430
Uh-huh. Just be prepared to lose.
You need to learn how to.


1514
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:56.110
- "Learn how to lose"
- Lose?


1515
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:57.950
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.


1516
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:59.030
[man 1] Look here.

1517
01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:01.310
- [man 2] This one looks healthy.
- [man 1] Looks nice.


1518
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:02.390
It does.

1519
01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:07.070
[exhales] First place is all mine.

1520
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:10.030
[both laugh]

1521
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:19.150
So it'll pass through all firewalls

1522
01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:22.510
and upload automatically to each device
in a 100-kilometer radius.


1523
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:25.070
- Hey, you're good!
- Yep.


1524
01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:27.790
Bluejacking through
unsecured Bluetooth networks.


1525
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:31.510
Kid, I used to do tech stuff like this
before Bluetooth was even a thing


1526
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:33.630
on a machine I
got for my First Communion.

1527
01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:35.950
Okay, listen, uh, if
you ever need a job...

1528
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:39.150
Uh, you're not ready for me.
Plus, I'm on maternity leave.


1529
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:41.270
Yeah?

1530
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:43.190
And where's your baby?

1531
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:45.790
What do you mean?
Where he should be. With his dad.


1532
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:49.390
[laughs] Let me see.

1533
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:51.830
[rock music playing]

1534
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.270
Turn off the camera!

1535
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:55.150
[Patricia] Oh my God!

1536
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:58.190
- Security!
- [guard] Easy! Easy!


1537
01:28:58.270 --> 01:29:00.870
- You see? Looks like I was right.
- You were right?


1538
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:03.110
I guess you were,
but I was right too! Wait.


1539
01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:04.950
- You were right?
- [cell phones ring]


1540
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:08.270
- [Wacuś] What's going on?
- [man] Kasia's beating up Bob!


1541
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:10.350
[rock music continues]

1542
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:23.190
We're a team again. [chuckles]

1543
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:25.270
[lively folk music playing]

1544
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:26.830
[Patryk] Hold up.

1545
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:28.910
[folk music continues]

1546
01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:37.750
Okay.

1547
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:39.910
Okay. Ready? [chuckles]

1548
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:42.430
Ready?

1549
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:43.510
Hey!

1550
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:45.990
[exciting folk music playing]

1551
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.150
Whoo!

1552
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:06.030
[exciting folk music continues]

1553
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:27.870
I've said from the start
that she was innocent.


1554
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:31.710
You? What did you say?
I should feel stupid? [scoffs]


1555
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:35.790
Well, you didn't believe your own sister.
Aren't you ashamed?


1556
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:39.110
Ah, just look at you!
You're an old man, huh?


1557
01:30:39.190 --> 01:30:40.510
But not an old nincompoop.

1558
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:42.430
Like some others I know.

1559
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:45.990
- Pola, Jola!
- [Pola] We're here.


1560
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:47.150
[all chuckle]

1561
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:52.750
Finally! So good of you
to show up. [chuckles]


1562
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:55.830
- [girls chuckle]
- We're leaving and seeing the race!


1563
01:30:55.910 --> 01:31:00.590
Oh, by the way, did you know
that groundhogs hibernate in Podhale?


1564
01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:02.510
Oh. Take notes, 
Jola, take notes.

1565
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:06.670
And did you know
groundhogs feed only on kale?


1566
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:08.630
Uh, hold on. Krzysiek, go warm up.

1567
01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:12.670
- Groundhogs subsist on kale.
- What are you saying? Kale? In Zakopane?


1568
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:15.510
Stop talking and go. Plan E.

1569
01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:17.750
- [Wacuś and Jędruś chuckle]
- Go, Paris!


1570
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:19.470
THREE WEEKS LATER

1571
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:20.550
[Patryk] Hey!

1572
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:22.590
[joyful string music playing]

1573
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:33.350
They're perfect!

1574
01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:39.550
Congratulations! 
He's a beautiful boy.

1575
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:43.630
Congratulations.

1576
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:46.790
Oh, my sweet little baby!

1577
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:48.870
[joyful string music continues]

1578
01:31:50.150 --> 01:31:51.150
[woman] Adorable!

1579
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:54.390
- Congratulations!
- Yeah! Give him to me.


1580
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:56.590
[joyful string music continues]

1581
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:03.886
- [man] Congrats on the race.
- Here's to your health and happiness.


1582
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:05.550
[man] To your health too, friends!

1583
01:32:05.630 --> 01:32:07.390
- Hey.
- [Kacper] Hi.


1584
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:11.230
- So, will it get you to Portugal?
- Yeah. Thanks to a great mechanic.


1585
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:12.510
[Kacper] Mm-hmm.

1586
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:15.390
And even if it breaks down,
we can walk the rest of the way.


1587
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:17.550
What about your job?

1588
01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:19.990
I gave them an ultimatum.
Remote work or nothing at all.


1589
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:22.910
I guess you do know
how to fix your mistakes after all.


1590
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:24.590
Will you visit us in Portugal?

1591
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:28.550
You'll always have a place to stay
in the mountains. [chuckles]


1592
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:29.630
[Kacper chuckles]

1593
01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:33.390
And how about you learn how to make smoked
cheese? Maybe you can start a business.


1594
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:35.630
And start carving Jesus figurines.

1595
01:32:35.710 --> 01:32:36.710
- Bye.
- [Wera] Bye.


1596
01:32:37.670 --> 01:32:39.870
- How about a rematch one day?
- On the board?


1597
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:42.830
- Uh, nah, on the waves.
- Okay. [chuckles]


1598
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:44.670
- Drive safe!
- Bye.


1599
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:47.910
[both sigh]

1600
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:50.230
How about an RV?

1601
01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:52.470
Nah.

1602
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:55.910
How long will it take you
to repair that rust bucket?


1603
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:57.950
- [Patryk] The motorcycle?
- Yeah.


1604
01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:01.230
It'll be ready when it's ready.

1605
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:02.830

[music fades]

1611
01:33:35.630 --> 01:33:37.190
You could still back out, you know?

1612
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:40.750
- I've surfed in far worse conditions.
- Yeah? When?


1613
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:43.670
- None of your business.
- [both laugh]


1614
01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:47.550
- After you.
- No, after you. Let's go, tough guy.
