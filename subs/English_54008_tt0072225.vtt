1
00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:09.419
Diana.

2
00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:11.293
Thank you.

3
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.069
You make good drinks.
-Did you like the show, Sugar?


4
00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:19.639
Dynamite. Dynamite.

5
00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:22.556
That's what people
say about you.


6
00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:25.375
They could be right.

7
00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:37.886
Apparently,
I'm handling it well.


8
00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.504
Perfect. 
- Just perfect.

9
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:49.257
I love you, Sugar.

10
00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:51.965
I love you too, Langston.

11
00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:54.644
Hey, Langston, my man.

12
00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.477
I'm not your guy.

13
00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:06.565
I'll tell you one last time.

14
00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.704
You don't tell me shit.
- Isn't he a tough nigga?


15
00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:13.868
He sure is.
He must have forgotten who we are.


16
00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:15.951
Well, no,
he's just messing with us.


17
00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:21.133
Right, Langston?
Step closer and find out.


18
00:04:21.134 --> 00:04:23.463
Enough with the bullshit.
- You stop.


19
00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:25.232
Mr.
Morgan just wants to give you


20
00:04:25.232 --> 00:04:27.390
a fair price for your club.

21
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:28.990
Straightforward.

22
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.845
What the hell does Mr. Morgan
know about what's fair or not?


23
00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:34.899
He can take his offer
and shove it up his ass.


24
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.551
Your final word?

25
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.937
Final.

26
00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:47.205
You got a nice broad
there, Langston.


27
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:50.681
Lot of class for a
zipper guy like you.


28
00:04:50.683 --> 00:04:54.537
Fabulous, I'm throwing you out.
Now.


29
00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:01.283
Well, yes, brother.

30
00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:07.263
That's right.
We didn't come to swindle you.


31
00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:09.137
We're just businessmen.

32
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.442
Business works, or it doesn't.

33
00:05:20.577 --> 00:05:22.698
They're playing a game with
you, honey.


34
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.078
I'm not worried, Sugar.

35
00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:29.264
Neither should you.

36
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.048
I'll get rid of that
scum in no time.


37
00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.906
I don't want anything
to happen to my husband.


38
00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:41.153
It won't.
Nothing like that, Sugar.


39
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.365
I gotta get to that meeting.
Enjoy your drink.


40
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.445
What do you want to do with him?

41
00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:25.756
He's just trash.

42
00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:28.412
Leave him be.

43
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.379
What did they do to you?

44
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.799
Please don't leave me
alone, Langston.


45
00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:24.121
The guy was tough,
but he had to go down.


46
00:08:24.122 --> 00:08:26.242
You made sure he
never got up again.


47
00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:29.368
Like I said, gentlemen,

48
00:08:30.412 --> 00:08:33.507
if you want to destroy a man,
you have to do it once and for all.


49
00:08:33.925 --> 00:08:36.671
Put him under.

50
00:08:37.246 --> 00:08:40.005
Nothing more now than a piece of
cold, black meat.


51
00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:43.206
This is our way of
working from now on.


52
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.370
If Morgan wants something,
Morgan takes it.


53
00:08:46.684 --> 00:08:51.477
No fuss, simple,
direct, to the point.


54
00:08:52.103 --> 00:08:54.573
No frizzy heads
getting in our way.


55
00:08:55.408 --> 00:08:58.676
The guy had no manners.
- He doesn't need them anymore.


56
00:08:58.781 --> 00:09:00.341
The question is,

57
00:09:00.551 --> 00:09:03.020
how do you go about buying
the club from a dead man?


58
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.184
Celeste, honey,
it's been a long day.


59
00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:08.997
I'll figure it out in the
morning, okay?


60
00:09:11.188 --> 00:09:13.449
Come on, Fabulous,
you can do better than that.


61
00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:16.300
I'll get you an
honest your living.


62
00:09:22.767 --> 00:09:24.118
Diana?

63
00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:26.380
Valentine.

64
00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:29.857
It's been a while.
You look good.


65
00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:31.940
Do I?

66
00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:35.036
I'm sorry about
the circumstances.


67
00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:37.887
It's strange.

68
00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:41.639
After we broke up,

69
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.631
it bothered me for a long time
that you were with Langston.


70
00:09:44.632 --> 00:09:46.856
Yeah,but you turned
out all right.


71
00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:48.626
Anyway,

72
00:09:48.627 --> 00:09:51.305
I never thought I'd be
questioning you about his death.


73
00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:53.843
Murder.

74
00:09:56.493 --> 00:09:58.429
I met him here.

75
00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:00.169
He stepped up to me
and asked my name.


76
00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:03.438
Diana Hill, I said.

77
00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:07.397
He said,
from now on your name is Sugar.


78
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:09.451
Sugar Hill.

79
00:10:10.182 --> 00:10:13.658
Because you look so
sweet like sugar tastes.


80
00:10:16.787 --> 00:10:18.869
Are you handling the case?

81
00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:25.302
Do they ever turn for it?

82
00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:27.215
Men like that.

83
00:10:27.216 --> 00:10:30.236
They'll pay. Many times.

84
00:10:30.915 --> 00:10:32.915
You know,
if I knew who they were,


85
00:10:32.989 --> 00:10:35.245
I'd arrange it so

86
00:10:35.246 --> 00:10:41.291
that I could watch them
die one by one. Slowly.


87
00:12:27.006 --> 00:12:28.605
Mama?

88
00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:36.319
Mama Maitresse?

89
00:12:51.691 --> 00:12:53.738
Are you here, Mama?

90
00:13:27.945 --> 00:13:30.548
Please answer, Mama.

91
00:14:02.044 --> 00:14:06.182
Mama Maitresse? 
- Are you here?

92
00:14:23.474 --> 00:14:24.989
Mama.

93
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.489
Why have you
come back in here?


94
00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:35.695
You have come to see Mama Maitresse?
- Why?


95
00:14:37.469 --> 00:14:39.589
I need your help.

96
00:14:42.197 --> 00:14:45.843
I can feel your troubles,
it surrounds you.


97
00:14:48.973 --> 00:14:51.025
I was in love, Mama.

98
00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:55.232
But then they killed the man
I was going to marry.


99
00:14:55.439 --> 00:14:57.282
They beat him to death.

100
00:14:58.118 --> 00:15:00.446
I want them dead!

101
00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:05.658
I can feel both
your anger and your pain.


102
00:15:06.702 --> 00:15:08.754
And I sympathize with you.

103
00:15:09.068 --> 00:15:11.709
But what can I do?

104
00:15:12.858 --> 00:15:17.129
I know what you can do.
The powers you posses!


105
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.538
A long time ago, no more!

106
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:26.518
I am old and weak and
want only to be left alone.


107
00:15:27.562 --> 00:15:31.208
I've come to you because
I know you can help me!


108
00:15:33.503 --> 00:15:35.869
I am tired, very tired.

109
00:15:36.474 --> 00:15:40.075
It takes great effort,
I don't know.


110
00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:42.158
Please, Mama!

111
00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:44.211
I beg you.

112
00:15:47.341 --> 00:15:51.026
Child, you have always
been a disbeliever.


113
00:15:54.677 --> 00:15:56.758
Why do you now believe?

114
00:15:57.802 --> 00:16:00.897
Because I want revenge!

115
00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:04.479
Please, Mama Maitresse.

116
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.001
How strong is your hate?

117
00:16:28.045 --> 00:16:33.226
As strong as my love was,
my hate is stronger.


118
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.390
The risk is great.

119
00:16:38.477 --> 00:16:40.559
I am ready.

120
00:16:43.688 --> 00:16:45.219
Good.

121
00:16:50.122 --> 00:16:52.659
Into the flame,

122
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:57.629
I will call on the most
powerful of my voodoo gods.


123
00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:17.062
Where does the sun rise?
In the east, Mama.


124
00:17:17.376 --> 00:17:22.273
Where does the sun set?
In Guinea, Mama.


125
00:17:23.734 --> 00:17:30.584
Where does the power come from?
The living among the dead, Mama.


126
00:17:31.628 --> 00:17:37.920
Who can use the power?
The dead among the living.


127
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.957
Kneel down.

128
00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:23.979
Baron Samedi.

129
00:19:26.379 --> 00:19:30.546
Baron Samedi.
Keeper of the dead.


130
00:19:32.007 --> 00:19:34.685
King of the graveyards.

131
00:19:34.686 --> 00:19:38.892
Hear our cry.
Show your presence.


132
00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:40.975
Appear at our call.

133
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:48.243
He is a greedy God.
Do you have any money?


134
00:19:48.244 --> 00:19:50.677
No, nothing. Nothing, what?

135
00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:57.974
Baron Samedi, a gift for you.

136
00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:08.057
Try again, Mama.
- Your ring, give me your ring.


137
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:14.350
Another gift, Baron Samedi.

138
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.707
Who woke Baron Samedi
from his sleep?


139
00:20:37.812 --> 00:20:40.386
Baron Samedi.

140
00:20:46.227 --> 00:20:49.807
It's you, Mama Maitresse.

141
00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:55.018
We have come to ask for your help, Baron.
- Help?


142
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.470
I wish to possess the power
to destroy my enemies.


143
00:21:01.798 --> 00:21:04.372
Woman, who are you?

144
00:21:04.373 --> 00:21:08.579
I am Baron Samedi,
this is my territory.


145
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.747
My kingdom of the dead.

146
00:21:12.748 --> 00:21:17.929
She means no disrespect, sir.
Her name is Diana.


147
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.179
What will this Diana give
to Baron Samedi for the


148
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.262
power she seeks?

149
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:34.615
Who are they?
- They are the brides of Baron Samedi.


150
00:21:35.972 --> 00:21:39.865
He is a great lover.
-What will you give me?


151
00:21:41.952 --> 00:21:45.806
My soul. 
- Your soul?

152
00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:52.344
What is this talk of
souls, woman?


153
00:21:52.762 --> 00:21:58.637
I'm not interested in souls.

154
00:22:12.192 --> 00:22:16.017
You don't fear me? No.

155
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:19.494
Then tell me,
why do you want my powers?


156
00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:23.454
I want men to be punished.
-Punished?


157
00:22:23.455 --> 00:22:24.881
Dead.

158
00:22:25.195 --> 00:22:29.088
And I mean more than one man.
Can you help me?


159
00:22:29.465 --> 00:22:35.134
I have an army of the undead
waiting for your orders.


160
00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:40.316
Rise again.

161
00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:52.177
Listen, all of you who
are sworn to obey the will


162
00:22:52.178 --> 00:22:55.991
of Baron Samedi.
Slave and master.


163
00:22:55.992 --> 00:23:01.173
Master and slave. Wake up.

164
00:26:22.063 --> 00:26:25.367
I grant you your revenge.

165
00:26:25.576 --> 00:26:30.825
But evil is all they
know and desire.


166
00:27:05.032 --> 00:27:07.322
All right, I need ten men.

167
00:27:07.532 --> 00:27:09.376
For a container on a cargo ship.

168
00:27:09.971 --> 00:27:11.497
I have the job.

169
00:27:11.602 --> 00:27:14.205
You don't have a
nut unless you dock.


170
00:27:19.212 --> 00:27:21.890
I got a banana boat
coming in from Costa Rica.


171
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.993
What do you think, guys?
As many bananas as you can carry.


172
00:27:25.994 --> 00:27:27.658
And you're getting paid.

173
00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.920
We don't like to pay to work.

174
00:27:30.756 --> 00:27:34.127
Okay, no dough, no work. Next.

175
00:27:34.128 --> 00:27:36.523
We don't buy jobs.
-What did you say?


176
00:27:38.609 --> 00:27:43.478
You buy your job, slave boy.
Or you starve, understand?


177
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:46.016
You got that?

178
00:27:57.593 --> 00:27:59.883
You have more sense
than I suspected.


179
00:28:00.823 --> 00:28:02.353
All right, that's it.

180
00:28:58.493 --> 00:29:00.525
Who's there?

181
00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:03.814
I said, who is it?

182
00:29:21.436 --> 00:29:23.463
Hey, white girl!

183
00:29:23.907 --> 00:29:26.236
You and your scum
killed my husband.


184
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:30.195
You know, you actually have the
best ass in the neighborhood.


185
00:29:30.405 --> 00:29:33.667
I'd hate to see it
get cold for slander.


186
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.965
I'm not accusing you, handsome.

187
00:29:36.144 --> 00:29:38.538
I'm pronouncing your sentence.

188
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:41.947
I'm not getting to you, am I?

189
00:29:42.678 --> 00:29:45.529
And the verdict is: Death.

190
00:29:46.051 --> 00:29:47.715
Bullshit.

191
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:55.505
Please don't kill me.

192
00:29:55.819 --> 00:29:58.929
I didn't mean to.
He made me do it.


193
00:29:59.087 --> 00:30:01.481
I didn't mean to. No, please.

194
00:30:08.782 --> 00:30:10.835
That'll do.

195
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.772
I thought I saw everything.
- Let it develop immediately.


196
00:30:17.546 --> 00:30:21.087
I came as soon as I could.
Is it Tank Watson?


197
00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:23.036
We think so.

198
00:30:23.872 --> 00:30:25.470
You think so?

199
00:30:32.768 --> 00:30:35.342
We got something, Captain.
Come on.


200
00:30:45.981 --> 00:30:47.736
Well, what are you waiting for?

201
00:31:34.861 --> 00:31:37.393
How can you eat after
what happened to Tank?


202
00:31:37.498 --> 00:31:40.453
The boys are pretty shaken up.
He got cut up.


203
00:31:40.454 --> 00:31:41.910
Tell me about it later,

204
00:31:41.911 --> 00:31:43.650
I said, later.

205
00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:47.857
Get out there and find
out who's behind this.


206
00:31:48.484 --> 00:31:52.442
Now, you oaf.
All right, all right.


207
00:31:59.326 --> 00:32:02.422
Don't get excited,
it's not good for you.


208
00:32:04.926 --> 00:32:08.089
You know that the slightest
tension will upset your stomach.


209
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:12.153
Celeste, sometimes you
almost convince me that I am


210
00:32:12.154 --> 00:32:14.310
that I'm justifiably
nice to you.


211
00:32:14.937 --> 00:32:18.100
How you treat me,
is fine with me.


212
00:32:22.064 --> 00:32:25.084
This will already relieve
some of the tension.


213
00:32:28.527 --> 00:32:30.579
The rest will follow later.

214
00:32:31.623 --> 00:32:33.743
People refuse to leave me alone.

215
00:32:33.845 --> 00:32:37.045
A stoner hippie kills Tank
and the rest of them start...


216
00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:38.436
acting like women.

217
00:32:39.584 --> 00:32:42.917
So no traces on this?
- Just an old slave cuff.


218
00:32:42.918 --> 00:32:45.284
Kids find these from time
to time in the swamps.


219
00:32:45.285 --> 00:32:47.300
Nothing special. 
- Damn it.

220
00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:50.113
This was near the murdered man.

221
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:56.651
This is what I want you to see.

222
00:33:00.823 --> 00:33:04.821
What am I supposed to see?
- It came out of Tank's neck.


223
00:33:05.135 --> 00:33:07.529
So? 
- It's a fungus.

224
00:33:08.573 --> 00:33:12.711
What kind of mold?
- Not the kind you find on cheese.


225
00:33:13.338 --> 00:33:17.127
Okay, where do you find this one?
No idea.


226
00:33:17.232 --> 00:33:20.252
But the one that Tank grabbed
had dead skin on his fingers.


227
00:33:20.462 --> 00:33:23.974
You're nuts. Dead skin and mold?

228
00:33:24.496 --> 00:33:29.015
Lieutenant,
I'm not talking about dead skin cells


229
00:33:29.016 --> 00:33:31.098
being replaced,
that would be normal.


230
00:33:31.672 --> 00:33:34.716
We're talking about
the nerve endings,


231
00:33:34.717 --> 00:33:37.671
pigment cells,
epidermis, all dead.


232
00:33:38.402 --> 00:33:42.048
You mean the cells
are not living tissue.


233
00:33:46.533 --> 00:33:49.003
Then the killer wouldn't
be a living human being.


234
00:33:49.108 --> 00:33:51.958
That a dead tank killed Watson.

235
00:33:52.376 --> 00:33:54.458
Your words, not mine.

236
00:34:02.176 --> 00:34:03.707
Here she comes, boss.

237
00:34:04.021 --> 00:34:06.350
Glad you could make it.

238
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.537
I was afraid you had
other commitments.


239
00:34:08.538 --> 00:34:10.694
I did, but they can wait.

240
00:34:10.696 --> 00:34:14.067
Good, very good.
Have a seat, Miss Hill.


241
00:34:15.945 --> 00:34:19.070
Would you like some food?
I have the best chef in town.


242
00:34:19.488 --> 00:34:22.166
No, nothing for me.
But go ahead.


243
00:34:22.376 --> 00:34:25.330
I've finished eating.
A cup of coffee perhaps?


244
00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.621
Pour Miss Hill a cup of coffee.

245
00:34:28.457 --> 00:34:31.030
I'm not a waitress.
I said, pour coffee.


246
00:34:31.031 --> 00:34:34.194
I'm really fine.
Thank you anyway.


247
00:34:38.885 --> 00:34:41.981
Terrible thing
happened to Langston.


248
00:34:42.607 --> 00:34:47.335
You know, I considered him a friend.
We were going to be business partners.


249
00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:49.730
I negotiated his club, Haďti.

250
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:51.679
He left me the club.

251
00:34:57.625 --> 00:35:00.475
Imagine, a fast guy like Langston
leaving that club to you.


252
00:35:00.476 --> 00:35:03.287
to leave you that club.
- Why is that surprising?


253
00:35:03.914 --> 00:35:07.322
A lady like you wouldn't want
to run a place like that.


254
00:35:07.615 --> 00:35:10.173
I don't know. It's a success.

255
00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.673
It won't be hard
to manage the club.


256
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.957
Forgive me,
but you're being a little naive.


257
00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:17.891
Naive? How so?

258
00:35:18.205 --> 00:35:21.433
If you understood
the business world,


259
00:35:21.539 --> 00:35:24.112
you'd know of countless
examples of how


260
00:35:24.113 --> 00:35:27.068
how successful
businesses suddenly fail.


261
00:35:27.173 --> 00:35:29.255
What are you getting at?

262
00:35:29.506 --> 00:35:31.600
That you'd better sell the
club to someone who understands


263
00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:33.638
who knows about nightclubs.

264
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.223
Honestly, Mr. Morgan,
I wasn't thinking about it.


265
00:35:38.537 --> 00:35:41.424
It's just Morgan.
For my friends.


266
00:35:41.425 --> 00:35:43.545
We're going to be
friends, right?


267
00:35:44.172 --> 00:35:48.235
And as a friend,
I advise you to sell.


268
00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:55.017
I'm not entirely convinced.
I'm still pretty upset about it,


269
00:35:55.018 --> 00:35:58.142
Of course, I understand that.
Those things take time.


270
00:35:58.143 --> 00:35:59.674
Of course. Yes.

271
00:36:00.718 --> 00:36:02.317
Poor Langston.

272
00:36:02.631 --> 00:36:05.442
Of course,
I always fulfill my obligations,


273
00:36:05.443 --> 00:36:07.391
both to the living and the dead.

274
00:36:07.476 --> 00:36:08.991
So do I.

275
00:36:09.201 --> 00:36:11.699
So will you think
about what I said?


276
00:36:12.118 --> 00:36:14.796
I certainly will, Morgan.

277
00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:21.088
It was a pleasure, Miss Hill.

278
00:36:22.341 --> 00:36:24.735
My friends call me Sugar.

279
00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:26.997
Nice. Nice.

280
00:36:40.901 --> 00:36:42.953
A feisty lady.

281
00:36:43.997 --> 00:36:46.743
You didn't even introduce
me to that nigger.


282
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:50.286
What do you think I am?
A piece of furniture?


283
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.695
Celeste,
everybody knows what you are.


284
00:36:58.994 --> 00:37:02.386
I'll give Langston credit,
he had a taste for class.


285
00:37:02.804 --> 00:37:03.947
Class?

286
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.252
That's not class,
that's a gimmick.


287
00:37:08.713 --> 00:37:12.189
Whatever it is,
you could use some.


288
00:37:22.202 --> 00:37:24.700
Are you waiting for Morgan?
- Yes.


289
00:37:25.536 --> 00:37:28.839
He's not coming. 
- Says you.

290
00:37:29.362 --> 00:37:30.961
Sweetheart..,

291
00:37:30.962 --> 00:37:32.417
be smart and

292
00:37:32.627 --> 00:37:34.054
just get out of here.

293
00:37:34.472 --> 00:37:38.678
Celeste, you'd do well
to show some manners.


294
00:37:39.096 --> 00:37:41.386
Even if you don't have any.

295
00:37:41.804 --> 00:37:44.170
Out you go. Get out.

296
00:37:44.796 --> 00:37:49.107
Funny. You must be forgetting
that this is my club.


297
00:37:49.212 --> 00:37:51.815
It's you who knows
where the door is.


298
00:37:52.859 --> 00:37:55.328
Don't you dare
get cocky with me.


299
00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:57.241
Haughty?

300
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.661
About you? Baby,
talking to you is already derogatory.


301
00:38:03.287 --> 00:38:05.340
You nigger.

302
00:38:41.633 --> 00:38:44.274
With my compliments.

303
00:38:48.652 --> 00:38:51.643
You black whore,
you'll pay for this.


304
00:38:53.313 --> 00:38:55.433
You'll pay dearly for this.

305
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:06.035
Listen, you got one day
to come up with the dough.


306
00:39:06.098 --> 00:39:08.990
Or the whole lot and
your skin are mine.


307
00:39:09.534 --> 00:39:12.533
Understand? Yes?

308
00:39:12.638 --> 00:39:17.506
Yeah? Good. We don't want to make
Mr. Morgan sadly angry, do we?


309
00:39:18.342 --> 00:39:21.505
Sir? 
- Mr. O'Brien?

310
00:39:24.426 --> 00:39:26.924
Are you talking to
me, slave boy?


311
00:39:27.238 --> 00:39:31.376
Mr. Morgan says he wants
to talk to you now.


312
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.019
What? He told me.

313
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.623
And old Sam,
he doesn't contradict Mr. Morgan.


314
00:39:36.676 --> 00:39:39.824
No, he's not. He's a mean man.
He told me so,


315
00:39:39.825 --> 00:39:42.362
All right, all right.
Come on, let's go.


316
00:40:07.806 --> 00:40:09.650
Here we are.

317
00:40:17.347 --> 00:40:20.948
Where's Morgan?
- I brought you to him.


318
00:40:23.139 --> 00:40:27.202
Who's with him?
- Big shots from out of state.


319
00:40:27.516 --> 00:40:29.256
This way, sir.

320
00:41:13.402 --> 00:41:15.559
They're over there, sir.

321
00:41:29.743 --> 00:41:31.446
What's that over there?

322
00:41:56.267 --> 00:41:58.975
Hello, handsome,
do you remember me?


323
00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:01.549
Odd O'Brien.

324
00:42:01.634 --> 00:42:04.922
No. - I want to
show you something.


325
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:08.569
Wait till I get out of here.
- Look.


326
00:42:13.889 --> 00:42:16.462
You're not going to do anything
crazy, are you?


327
00:42:16.568 --> 00:42:18.479
Like with Tank, you mean?

328
00:42:18.585 --> 00:42:22.439
Was that you? I don't think so.

329
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.014
Then we'll have to convert you.

330
00:42:25.432 --> 00:42:29.221
You had your fun,
message understood.


331
00:42:30.473 --> 00:42:32.868
You're not planning on doing
anything other than that, are you?


332
00:42:33.077 --> 00:42:38.571
Of course not.
I gave you my word.


333
00:42:39.615 --> 00:42:41.735
I promised.

334
00:42:41.736 --> 00:42:46.946
Poor little pigs. Did you know they
didn't get any garbage for almost a week?


335
00:42:47.156 --> 00:42:50.043
They're awfully hungry,
I'll tell you that much.


336
00:42:50.044 --> 00:42:54.250
Then feed them.
- That's my point.


337
00:42:58.106 --> 00:43:00.993
My God, no.

338
00:43:18.931 --> 00:43:21.573
Hopefully they like
good white meat.


339
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.869
That's all, ladies.
I'll call if I want to see you tomorrow.


340
00:43:47.434 --> 00:43:49.486
Well, there. 
- Hello.

341
00:43:50.113 --> 00:43:52.650
One thing hasn't changed.

342
00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:57.862
You work as hard as ever.
You were gone a long time, Valentine.


343
00:43:57.967 --> 00:44:02.001
If I remember correctly it had
more to do with you than me.


344
00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:04.399
What brings you here today?

345
00:44:04.922 --> 00:44:08.293
Work. 
- It used to be fun.

346
00:44:08.294 --> 00:44:10.376
Yes, in the past.

347
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:15.871
It would be nice if it could
be done again in present time.


348
00:44:16.602 --> 00:44:21.329
Things change with time.
Sometimes back to their old self.


349
00:44:24.667 --> 00:44:29.148
You probably heard about the murders.
- What murders?


350
00:44:29.149 --> 00:44:31.201
Two of Morgan's are male.

351
00:44:33.705 --> 00:44:36.451
I don't have to mourn
that, do I?


352
00:44:36.452 --> 00:44:38.951
I didn't know them but
knew what they were.


353
00:44:39.056 --> 00:44:40.378
Scum.

354
00:44:40.588 --> 00:44:44.304
I get the impression that their
deaths were some kind of punishment.


355
00:44:45.838 --> 00:44:47.919
What's that supposed to mean?

356
00:44:48.546 --> 00:44:50.807
Honey, I'm a cop.

357
00:44:51.434 --> 00:44:54.180
They sometimes get suspicions
that seem far-fetched.


358
00:44:54.389 --> 00:44:57.722
But those suspicions are sometimes
better than any evidence.


359
00:44:57.723 --> 00:45:00.996
I'm not accusing you of acting
on your suspicions, Valentine.


360
00:45:00.997 --> 00:45:03.565
I'm just saying that
you're wrong this time.


361
00:45:03.984 --> 00:45:06.899
Maybe you really don't know
anything about the murders.


362
00:45:08.882 --> 00:45:11.247
Just for old times' sake,

363
00:45:11.352 --> 00:45:15.037
be careful.
Morgan is not to be trifled with.


364
00:45:15.038 --> 00:45:17.432
I'm smart enough to know that.

365
00:45:18.372 --> 00:45:21.050
I know exactly how smart you
are, Sugar.


366
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.631
You're capable of doing
anything you set your mind to.


367
00:45:24.632 --> 00:45:28.591
Valentine, do I really
look like a psycho killer?


368
00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:31.687
That's not a fair question.
- Why?


369
00:45:32.293 --> 00:45:35.373
Honey, in my eyes
you're always beautiful.


370
00:45:43.717 --> 00:45:47.258
I intend to keep in touch.
- Do that.


371
00:45:47.885 --> 00:45:49.416
Lieutenant.

372
00:45:56.717 --> 00:45:58.837
Hello, my dear fellow.

373
00:45:59.464 --> 00:46:01.337
Looking for me?

374
00:46:03.528 --> 00:46:05.059
You better believe it.

375
00:46:05.477 --> 00:46:07.493
Why?

376
00:46:07.807 --> 00:46:09.263
Georgie.

377
00:46:10.307 --> 00:46:14.445
You're a big guy.
Can't you figure that out?


378
00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:18.130
You chicks just can't get enough
of the good stuff, can you?


379
00:46:18.653 --> 00:46:21.777
White is white.

380
00:46:23.238 --> 00:46:25.708
I thought you were into me.

381
00:46:25.709 --> 00:46:29.081
That time at Morgan's I saw
the way you looked at me.


382
00:46:29.812 --> 00:46:31.997
My car is waiting outside.

383
00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:34.885
Or would you rather stay here,

384
00:46:35.616 --> 00:46:37.215
and have a little talk?

385
00:46:54.632 --> 00:46:56.609
Come in, Georgie.

386
00:46:57.757 --> 00:47:01.061
Fancy it. 
- Do you like it?

387
00:47:03.461 --> 00:47:06.624
What's that?
- For the cover of a magazine.


388
00:47:09.232 --> 00:47:11.835
Looking for anything
in particular?


389
00:47:12.879 --> 00:47:16.391
There's something wrong with this place.
The candles, the dolls, that.


390
00:47:16.392 --> 00:47:20.285
I don't like the whole thing.
Nothing about it.


391
00:47:20.318 --> 00:47:23.307
You and I are going to have a talk.
- Talk, what do you mean, talk?


392
00:47:23.308 --> 00:47:25.360
Why did you bring me here?

393
00:47:25.987 --> 00:47:29.098
You've got three seconds to
tell me what's going on here


394
00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:32.171
and who you work for.
- You sure you want to know?


395
00:47:32.172 --> 00:47:34.224
Who? 
- Him.

396
00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.853
What's that for?

397
00:48:06.068 --> 00:48:09.923
When the doll's in flames,
you take the knife and you use it.


398
00:48:10.237 --> 00:48:11.841
On yourself.

399
00:48:11.873 --> 00:48:15.036
That's madness. Or justice.

400
00:48:15.037 --> 00:48:17.640
My kind of justice, Georgie.

401
00:48:17.954 --> 00:48:20.632
I won't do it. 
- Yes, you will.

402
00:48:21.259 --> 00:48:23.483
No, I won't do it.

403
00:48:28.803 --> 00:48:30.572
I can't.

404
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.484
No. I won't do it.

405
00:48:58.593 --> 00:49:01.026
I refuse. Don't do it.

406
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.673
You will die by your own hand.

407
00:49:04.883 --> 00:49:06.622
Very relaxed.

408
00:49:08.292 --> 00:49:13.124
There's nothing you can do.
I have the power to kill you.


409
00:49:19.066 --> 00:49:24.247
Use the knife, Georgie.
Choose it.


410
00:49:48.234 --> 00:49:50.667
Who is it? 
- Nobody.

411
00:49:51.085 --> 00:49:53.480
But someone brought
you something.


412
00:49:56.296 --> 00:49:59.704
What the hell is this? No idea.

413
00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:09.439
Get the phone.
Fabulous is gonna be here any minute.


414
00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.426
Doctor Parkhurst.

415
00:50:30.574 --> 00:50:34.259
Rudolph Valentine,
how nice to see you again. Come on in.


416
00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:37.384
We only see each other
when I can use some help.


417
00:50:37.385 --> 00:50:39.333
Please have a seat. 
- Thank you.

418
00:50:39.334 --> 00:50:43.853
Not that voodoo stuff again?
No talismans and stuff?


419
00:50:43.854 --> 00:50:46.666
No. I closed that
department a few years ago.


420
00:50:46.688 --> 00:50:50.179
Homicide now. 
- Good for you.

421
00:50:50.389 --> 00:50:52.926
Interesting. A cup of tea?

422
00:50:52.927 --> 00:50:55.009
No, thanks. Doctor Parkhurst,

423
00:50:55.323 --> 00:50:58.105
I sought you out because you were
the only one who would believe me.


424
00:50:58.106 --> 00:51:00.226
That's a strange statement.

425
00:51:02.313 --> 00:51:04.707
There were three
murders recently.


426
00:51:04.708 --> 00:51:06.448
I can't go to my
superiors with this.


427
00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:08.569
They laugh at me out loud.
I don't understand.


428
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.026
A slave cuff.

429
00:51:10.757 --> 00:51:12.184
Where did you find it?

430
00:51:12.498 --> 00:51:15.035
It's possible evidence.

431
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.952
Late 40s. Maybe early 50s.

432
00:51:18.996 --> 00:51:23.134
Slaves were brought
here from Guinea.


433
00:51:23.552 --> 00:51:27.341
Many didn't survive the trip
because of the diseases on board.


434
00:51:27.342 --> 00:51:30.883
They lay outside the city in
swamps in soggy graveyards.


435
00:51:30.884 --> 00:51:33.875
Most with their shackles still on.
In fact,


436
00:51:33.876 --> 00:51:36.101
this could be a powerful youjou.

437
00:51:36.102 --> 00:51:37.453
Joujou?

438
00:51:37.455 --> 00:51:38.777
A voodoo toy.

439
00:51:39.195 --> 00:51:42.984
I suspect the three
murders involve voodoo.


440
00:51:43.298 --> 00:51:46.109
The buoy was found
near the crime scene.


441
00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:49.206
And there's still
tangible evidence.


442
00:51:49.624 --> 00:51:50.910
Dead skin.

443
00:51:51.328 --> 00:51:53.409
The way the murders
were committed.


444
00:51:54.039 --> 00:51:55.912
Almost ritualistic.

445
00:51:56.052 --> 00:51:59.667
The best library on the
subject is in this room.


446
00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:03.525
And I like to shed
light on things.


447
00:52:03.842 --> 00:52:05.924
One aspect in particular?

448
00:52:05.925 --> 00:52:09.333
Yes, the secrets.
The curses, the rituals of voodoo.


449
00:52:09.334 --> 00:52:12.601
When can we get started? 
- We?

450
00:52:12.759 --> 00:52:17.187
I'm not stepping up to my boss
without something to back up my story.


451
00:52:18.022 --> 00:52:19.449
All the records are in there.

452
00:52:22.578 --> 00:52:25.950
What does that mean, nothing?

453
00:52:26.055 --> 00:52:28.450
Boss,
I looked everywhere possible.


454
00:52:28.868 --> 00:52:30.920
Nobody's talking
about these murders.


455
00:52:31.234 --> 00:52:33.459
Especially not to me.

456
00:52:33.564 --> 00:52:37.210
Anything that has to do with
you seems to be bewitched.


457
00:52:37.419 --> 00:52:40.306
Someone's cooking something
up and I want to know who.


458
00:52:40.307 --> 00:52:44.513
You go out there and put
pressure on anyone who knows me.


459
00:52:44.514 --> 00:52:47.639
Every errand boy,
client and snitch.


460
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.318
Let 'em know I want the sheet
of whoever's hunting me.


461
00:52:50.736 --> 00:52:53.273
Scare them good and
get this over with.


462
00:53:03.859 --> 00:53:07.766
Easy, honey. Relax.
- Did I ask you?


463
00:53:07.798 --> 00:53:09.506
Come on, let me help you.

464
00:53:09.925 --> 00:53:12.670
How the hell would
you be of use?


465
00:53:12.672 --> 00:53:14.753
You know what? Forget it.

466
00:53:15.171 --> 00:53:18.266
Can't you see I'm
trying to help you?


467
00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:24.559
I see nothing but emptiness
when I look at you.


468
00:53:24.769 --> 00:53:26.642
What's that supposed to mean?

469
00:53:27.686 --> 00:53:29.842
Get out of my sight.

470
00:53:55.394 --> 00:53:57.514
Hey, preacher.

471
00:53:58.141 --> 00:54:00.118
I want to talk to you, man.

472
00:54:02.935 --> 00:54:06.864
I said let's talk.
I don't know anything.


473
00:54:07.074 --> 00:54:08.985
I don't know anything.

474
00:54:08.986 --> 00:54:11.277
Nothing happens without
you knowing about it.


475
00:54:11.278 --> 00:54:15.520
Who approached Tank?
And O'Brien? And George?


476
00:54:15.803 --> 00:54:18.371
Honestly,
I'd tell you if I knew.


477
00:54:18.372 --> 00:54:20.454
Don't fuck with me, nigger.

478
00:54:21.498 --> 00:54:23.133
Who did?

479
00:54:24.209 --> 00:54:26.679
If you don't know, ask around.

480
00:54:26.993 --> 00:54:29.008
Maybe this will jog your memory.

481
00:54:38.187 --> 00:54:39.538
Buddy..,

482
00:54:40.269 --> 00:54:43.365
if you want to keep your head in one
piece, you didn't see a thing.


483
00:54:43.783 --> 00:54:48.614
Yeah, I didn't see anything.
But I definitely didn't see anything.


484
00:54:49.658 --> 00:54:53.826
Maybe a drink on the house.
My special cocktail.


485
00:54:54.452 --> 00:54:57.652
A drink I'm famous for.

486
00:54:57.966 --> 00:55:02.380
The zombie. Soak it in, Sambu.

487
00:55:38.878 --> 00:55:43.225
You. 
- Yes, King. Me.

488
00:55:48.023 --> 00:55:50.144
Help me.

489
00:55:50.666 --> 00:55:52.226
Help you?

490
00:55:52.853 --> 00:55:54.697
I'll help you, honey.

491
00:55:54.698 --> 00:55:57.548
Like Tank and the
rest helped Langston.


492
00:55:57.549 --> 00:56:01.299
I wasn't there.
I didn't do anything.


493
00:56:01.404 --> 00:56:05.751
You'll get your punishment for all
the times you didn't get caught.


494
00:56:05.961 --> 00:56:07.559
Tough break.

495
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.329
Help me.

496
00:56:09.435 --> 00:56:13.051
Keep talking Please.

497
00:56:18.267 --> 00:56:20.387
Baron.

498
00:56:57.824 --> 00:57:01.857
A moment more and Morgan will
realize that he is the only one left.


499
00:57:02.067 --> 00:57:04.187
That he is completely alone.

500
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:09.607
He will wish that his own
death was so merciful.


501
00:57:18.785 --> 00:57:20.838
Preacher.

502
00:57:21.464 --> 00:57:26.817
Man, you gotta talk to me.
- Yeah, talk, yeah.


503
00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:29.943
Would you remember them
if you saw them again?


504
00:57:30.048 --> 00:57:32.935
I don't ever want to see anything
like that again. Never, ever.


505
00:57:32.937 --> 00:57:34.812
Relax.

506
00:57:37.525 --> 00:57:40.688
I've never seen anything like this.
Not like this. Never.


507
00:57:41.001 --> 00:57:42.770
Picture it again.

508
00:57:43.084 --> 00:57:44.824
Can you recognize them?

509
00:57:45.419 --> 00:57:47.675
They were like corpses.

510
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:51.009
If I encounter them again,
I hope they don't recognize me.


511
00:57:52.157 --> 00:57:53.688
Like corpses?

512
00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:56.643
Yes, like corpses.

513
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:06.756
You can have these.
The pressure is terrible.


514
00:58:06.757 --> 00:58:10.478
That voodoo's fascinating.
It swallows you up.


515
00:58:10.479 --> 00:58:12.078
I've been studying
it all my life


516
00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:15.099
and I'm afraid it's only now that I'm
beginning to understand what it means.


517
00:58:17.603 --> 00:58:21.324
Are there any voodoo priests here?
- Yes, there are.


518
00:58:21.325 --> 00:58:23.758
It's not something
the people talk about.


519
00:58:23.863 --> 00:58:26.779
There was a voodoo
queen for many years.


520
00:58:26.989 --> 00:58:28.624
She held a lot of power.

521
00:58:28.625 --> 00:58:31.267
It was rumored that she could
bring the dead back to life.


522
00:58:31.268 --> 00:58:33.349
How long has she been dead?
- Dead?


523
00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:34.881
Mama Maitresse is not dead.

524
00:58:34.915 --> 00:58:36.967
Where can I find her?

525
00:58:37.385 --> 00:58:41.174
I have no idea.
We always met at a fork in the road.


526
00:58:41.175 --> 00:58:45.029
Where the Way of the Cross
ends by the railroad tracks.


527
00:58:45.135 --> 00:58:46.666
That's close to

528
00:58:46.959 --> 00:58:49.934
Frenchmen's corner.
- Yeah, right. Why?


529
00:59:07.247 --> 00:59:09.328
Valentine at Hill's house.

530
00:59:09.538 --> 00:59:11.694
How's it going?

531
00:59:11.696 --> 00:59:14.546
I'm surprised I found you here.

532
00:59:14.547 --> 00:59:17.671
I get away when I can.
- Totally agree.


533
00:59:17.672 --> 00:59:19.725
The city can be
crowded at times.


534
00:59:19.726 --> 00:59:22.576
It's calm and peaceful here.

535
00:59:23.933 --> 00:59:27.057
Strange that we never
spent much time here.


536
00:59:28.101 --> 00:59:30.153
We'll have to make up for that.

537
00:59:31.823 --> 00:59:34.360
I've been hitting the books.

538
00:59:34.674 --> 00:59:36.651
You never told me that
your childhood home


539
00:59:36.652 --> 00:59:38.913
has such an interesting history.

540
00:59:39.019 --> 00:59:41.660
Interesting?
- Voodoo, to be exact.


541
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:44.786
Every old house in this
area has a history.


542
00:59:44.787 --> 00:59:47.882
Yeah, but no resident priestess.

543
00:59:49.969 --> 00:59:51.672
What do you mean?

544
00:59:51.881 --> 00:59:54.276
Is it possible to
speak Mama Maitress?


545
00:59:56.258 --> 00:59:59.875
Why on earth would you do that?
- It's just a hunch.


546
00:59:59.876 --> 01:00:02.205
Maybe she can help me.

547
01:00:02.519 --> 01:00:05.643
There's something odd
about all these murders.


548
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.739
Every single one has
something to do with


549
01:00:09.335 --> 01:00:11.173
voodoo rituals.

550
01:00:11.957 --> 01:00:16.176
You do grasp at straws.

551
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.125
Good evening, Miss Hill.

552
01:00:18.439 --> 01:00:20.246
Lieutenant, this is,

553
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.310
Old Sam, sir.
I've been the handyman here since


554
01:00:24.729 --> 01:00:26.468
time immemorial.

555
01:00:26.469 --> 01:00:30.049
The Lieutenant is fascinated by voodoo
and wants to speak to Mama Maitresse.


556
01:00:30.676 --> 01:00:32.758
Voodoo, sir?

557
01:00:35.887 --> 01:00:40.234
Come on, let's go find her.
- Best let Old Sam lead the way.


558
01:00:40.339 --> 01:00:45.275
The swamp is crawling with vermin.
Snakes and such creatures.


559
01:00:46.316 --> 01:00:48.368
After you, Sam.

560
01:00:55.231 --> 01:00:58.829
Did you know that victims are
buried here from the slave trade?


561
01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:01.477
Yeah, every kid who goes
to school here knows that.


562
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:21.150
This man is not a believer.

563
01:01:29.077 --> 01:01:33.244
You shouldn't go after her.
One thing Old Sam knows,


564
01:01:33.245 --> 01:01:36.027
is that you only see Mama
when she wants to see you.


565
01:01:36.028 --> 01:01:39.504
Yes, but, It's better to wait.

566
01:01:39.505 --> 01:01:43.464
When the time is right and it must
be, she will meet you.


567
01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:54.382
She's still in good
shape for a 100-year-old.


568
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:04.898
Don't be bothered,
she's an old, grouchy woman.


569
01:02:04.901 --> 01:02:09.014
Diana, do you believe in the undead?
- What?


570
01:02:10.058 --> 01:02:12.215
The undead. 
- Zombies.

571
01:02:12.842 --> 01:02:14.858
Valentine, you're nuts.

572
01:02:16.527 --> 01:02:18.713
I'll let you in on a secret.

573
01:02:19.131 --> 01:02:21.184
I do believe in them.

574
01:02:21.602 --> 01:02:24.869
Everyone has the right to
believe in whatever they want.


575
01:02:26.956 --> 01:02:29.246
I have to go.
I'll call you tonight.


576
01:02:57.248 --> 01:03:00.813
Karl, could you point the
reflector more to the left?


577
01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.977
Sugar?

578
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.670
I'd like to talk to you.

579
01:03:09.192 --> 01:03:11.274
Yes, of course.

580
01:03:11.275 --> 01:03:13.327
Girls, take a break.

581
01:03:17.604 --> 01:03:20.350
The documents have been prepared
for the sale of the club.


582
01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:21.494
Good,

583
01:03:21.495 --> 01:03:24.694
the sooner these worries go
away, the better I'll feel.


584
01:03:24.699 --> 01:03:29.527
Do you have the papers with you?
- Fabulous.


585
01:03:33.908 --> 01:03:35.260
Thank you.

586
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.759
Morgan,
I know the value of the club.


587
01:03:49.832 --> 01:03:52.261
This is theft.

588
01:03:52.367 --> 01:03:54.031
Theft?

589
01:03:55.388 --> 01:04:00.256
I don't like games. Do you?

590
01:04:00.361 --> 01:04:03.420
I was never very good at
them, so obviously I'm not.


591
01:04:04.047 --> 01:04:08.423
Unless I have the advantage
and know that I will win.


592
01:04:11.761 --> 01:04:15.169
Are you saying I'll lose if
I don't give you your way?


593
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.020
It's for your own good.

594
01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.937
Sign those papers and
your worries are over.


595
01:04:20.938 --> 01:04:22.573
In the blink of an eye.

596
01:04:22.574 --> 01:04:25.216
You have as much money as you
want and all the time to enjoy it.


597
01:04:25.843 --> 01:04:29.489
How about a little extra
for my cooperation?


598
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.064
Something the taxes
never find out.


599
01:04:32.586 --> 01:04:34.706
You won't miss it, Morgan.

600
01:04:34.916 --> 01:04:36.789
How much?

601
01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.572
10,000 sounds good to me.

602
01:04:45.622 --> 01:04:47.846
5,000 sounds better to me, but

603
01:04:48.515 --> 01:04:53.475
I want to start our
relationship off positively, so,


604
01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:55.528
10,000 is a deal.

605
01:04:55.842 --> 01:05:00.569
You're so nice and accommodating.
I should have asked for more.


606
01:05:01.819 --> 01:05:05.435
You're too smart a girl
to take things too far.


607
01:05:05.436 --> 01:05:07.557
That's what I like about you.

608
01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:10.473
That and more.

609
01:05:10.725 --> 01:05:13.257
I must get on with my work.
- Of course.


610
01:05:13.466 --> 01:05:17.464
Go ahead. I don't want to disturb
an honest, hardworking girl.


611
01:05:17.778 --> 01:05:19.546
You don't see many of those.

612
01:05:21.633 --> 01:05:24.103
You bring this money
to her tonight.


613
01:05:30.882 --> 01:05:34.911
Why are you giving her extra money?
- Why don't you shut up?


614
01:05:36.236 --> 01:05:38.318
Did you hear anything?

615
01:05:38.736 --> 01:05:42.561
Idiotic rumors mostly.
- Like what?


616
01:05:43.501 --> 01:05:46.247
Claims of voodoo murders.

617
01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:50.832
Talk that I'd also spread
to cover my tracks.


618
01:05:52.502 --> 01:05:56.014
Someone wants to take over my territory.
Someone from out of state.


619
01:05:56.015 --> 01:05:59.178
A local thug we would
have found long ago.


620
01:05:59.492 --> 01:06:03.347
Shall I travel north?
Do some research?


621
01:06:04.912 --> 01:06:07.799
I want you to stay
close to me exclusively.


622
01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.693
Like a second skin, understand?

623
01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:14.818
Very well.

624
01:06:29.837 --> 01:06:31.159
Sugar?

625
01:06:48.785 --> 01:06:50.592
Damn it! Damn it!

626
01:07:03.837 --> 01:07:07.379
Get off me. My God, get off!

627
01:07:23.753 --> 01:07:27.161
Sugar? 
- Who's there?

628
01:08:04.946 --> 01:08:07.729
Now, Mr. Baker,

629
01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:10.580
you remember Langston?

630
01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:13.705
I got the money with me.

631
01:08:21.528 --> 01:08:24.415
You're gonna die soon,Baker.

632
01:08:24.728 --> 01:08:28.309
No, the money.
- The money, here.


633
01:08:31.125 --> 01:08:33.520
Money buys everything,
doesn't it?


634
01:08:34.094 --> 01:08:36.616
I want to introduce
you to Baron Samedi.


635
01:08:36.826 --> 01:08:39.780
And what he'll do to
you, Mr. Baker,


636
01:08:40.355 --> 01:08:42.906
will cost you one penny.

637
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:48.088
It's free and clear.

638
01:08:48.402 --> 01:08:50.209
What do you want?

639
01:08:51.253 --> 01:08:53.334
What's that for?

640
01:09:07.936 --> 01:09:11.344
You don't die without some
company, Baker.


641
01:09:26.049 --> 01:09:31.298
Money, the answer to everything.
Take it with you.


642
01:09:31.507 --> 01:09:34.319
Wonder what you'll
buy where you'll go.


643
01:09:42.872 --> 01:09:45.967
I waited all night.
Your guy didn't show.


644
01:09:48.575 --> 01:09:50.799
10,000 dollars.

645
01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:54.864
I'll find the bastard
and when I do,


646
01:09:54.865 --> 01:09:56.917
bring me Baker or the money.

647
01:09:56.918 --> 01:09:59.768
Hurry up. All right. You got it.

648
01:10:00.082 --> 01:10:02.164
I assure you, it'll be fine.

649
01:10:07.692 --> 01:10:10.474
Are you trying to trick me?

650
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:14.646
How do I know you're
not trying to trick me?


651
01:10:15.272 --> 01:10:17.810
After all,
you were Langston's girl.


652
01:10:18.124 --> 01:10:21.978
You have no reason
to, how can I put it?


653
01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:24.449
to like me.

654
01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:29.281
I can think of 10,000
reasons to like you.


655
01:10:31.368 --> 01:10:35.535
Just trust me.
You won't regret it.


656
01:10:37.622 --> 01:10:41.030
I wish. I put myself first

657
01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:42.839
to trust no one.

658
01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.964
But I can be convinced
sometimes to make an exception.


659
01:10:52.744 --> 01:10:54.588
Let's go.

660
01:11:10.994 --> 01:11:13.359
Just convince me, okay?

661
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:16.210
Trust me.

662
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:26.115
If I find out you're cheating on me
you'll die with remorse on your lips.


663
01:11:26.585 --> 01:11:28.376
Get the hell out of here.

664
01:11:30.672 --> 01:11:35.191
I think it's a lot of money
to play a prank on a friend.


665
01:11:35.504 --> 01:11:37.065
Excuse me.

666
01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:40.891
Good day. L'amour's massage.
L'amour herself.


667
01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:45.828
Yes. 
- Six o'clock tonight.

668
01:11:46.455 --> 01:11:48.536
Thank you for calling.

669
01:11:50.143 --> 01:11:53.927
I doubt if I should.
Hundred dollars.


670
01:11:54.762 --> 01:11:58.968
120 dollars? 
- I'm convinced.

671
01:11:58.969 --> 01:12:01.051
Are you sure he'll come?

672
01:12:01.052 --> 01:12:03.625
He hasn't missed a single
Thursday in six months.


673
01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.121
Good.

674
01:12:15.652 --> 01:12:18.747
What can I do for you
tonight, pal?


675
01:12:18.852 --> 01:12:22.745
Where's Opal?
- She has Spanish flu.


676
01:12:22.955 --> 01:12:25.037
She asked to take care of you.

677
01:12:25.559 --> 01:12:27.194
By you?

678
01:12:30.845 --> 01:12:35.468
Her pretty, sensual friend
is coming to see you tonight.


679
01:12:37.242 --> 01:12:41.097
But since Opal's sick,
you won't regret it.


680
01:12:59.139 --> 01:13:00.879
Hello.

681
01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:05.712
Like what you see?

682
01:13:08.633 --> 01:13:11.966
You must be the one, big guy.

683
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:16.939
I'm tense, my back is stiff.

684
01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.956
Better work on that.

685
01:13:31.471 --> 01:13:36.994
Great. Do it rough.
-How come you're so tense, honey?


686
01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.219
I don't want to talk about it.

687
01:13:48.956 --> 01:13:51.598
I'm getting an idea.

688
01:13:53.059 --> 01:13:57.852
I'm sure you do.
It's quiet tonight.


689
01:14:02.024 --> 01:14:07.810
Would you like some exotic
dolls to massage you?


690
01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:10.369
You know, like in the movies.

691
01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:14.538
I'll even get you a
discount, baby.


692
01:14:18.814 --> 01:14:21.284
I'm all yours.

693
01:14:21.806 --> 01:14:28.098
All right, then. Stay right there.
I'll be back soon.


694
01:14:48.957 --> 01:14:51.038
What's taking you so long?

695
01:14:55.784 --> 01:14:58.306
I get lonely fast.

696
01:15:15.025 --> 01:15:17.390
What are you scratching me with?

697
01:15:20.207 --> 01:15:22.327
Your hands are cold.

698
01:15:25.144 --> 01:15:27.434
I don't like this.

699
01:15:28.582 --> 01:15:31.678
Treat me gently.

700
01:15:37.936 --> 01:15:40.056
Enough! Enough!

701
01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:08.210
I know it sounds crazy.

702
01:16:08.733 --> 01:16:10.889
But I immersed myself
in that voodoo.


703
01:16:10.995 --> 01:16:15.514
I told you to let it go.
Your imagination is guiding your actions.


704
01:16:15.619 --> 01:16:19.682
It's a gang war.
We're just missing the other gang.


705
01:16:19.891 --> 01:16:22.778
Captain, that seems like the
most logical explanation.


706
01:16:22.883 --> 01:16:25.942
But we checked with
all our contacts.


707
01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:28.025
And I'm sure Morgan
did the same.


708
01:16:28.339 --> 01:16:31.121
We're both at a loss.

709
01:16:32.165 --> 01:16:35.881
Are you seriously suggesting
that someone is using voodoo


710
01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:38.453
to kill Morgan's men?

711
01:16:40.853 --> 01:16:44.470
Possibly. Maybe not.

712
01:16:44.888 --> 01:16:47.425
Check it out. Inconspicuous.

713
01:16:47.426 --> 01:16:50.238
If this gets out,
they'll lock us both up.


714
01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.279
Do you like that policeman?
- I like him, yeah.


715
01:16:59.592 --> 01:17:02.443
Does it bother you? 
- Me, Sugar?

716
01:17:02.444 --> 01:17:04.838
Nothing bothers me.

717
01:17:05.569 --> 01:17:08.873
He's on your trail.
What are you going to do about it?


718
01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:13.914
That's why we're here. Stop him.

719
01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:17.040
But don't kill him.

720
01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:19.406
Killing him is easier.

721
01:17:19.511 --> 01:17:22.674
Do as I ask.
- It's already done.


722
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:53.508
Valentine, are you dressed?

723
01:18:01.414 --> 01:18:05.015
What happened?
- I fell down the stairs.


724
01:18:05.641 --> 01:18:09.809
I don't understand.
And neither do the doctors.


725
01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:14.365
I know my leg is broken,
but I feel no pain.


726
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:16.486
That's bizarre.

727
01:18:16.487 --> 01:18:18.569
Valentine,
you were working too hard.


728
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:22.082
Rest. I'm sure you'll be
quickly discharged from here.


729
01:18:23.367 --> 01:18:25.837
How sure? 
- Just you wait.

730
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.583
I can't stay.

731
01:18:28.585 --> 01:18:31.083
I have an appointment.
I'll see you later.


732
01:18:32.127 --> 01:18:34.180
Diana.

733
01:18:36.371 --> 01:18:39.429
I see what's going on here.

734
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:41.720
I don't know how big your
share is in all this,


735
01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:45.442
but if I find out,
I won't know what you're talking about.


736
01:18:47.008 --> 01:18:48.815
See you soon.

737
01:19:06.128 --> 01:19:07.584
Hey, there.

738
01:19:08.836 --> 01:19:10.158
What do you want?

739
01:19:10.681 --> 01:19:12.801
He's not here.

740
01:19:13.532 --> 01:19:15.927
I'm telling you he's not here.
- Who is?


741
01:19:18.013 --> 01:19:19.440
Yes?

742
01:19:19.441 --> 01:19:22.187
I decided not to sell the club after all.
- Yes.


743
01:19:23.231 --> 01:19:25.938
You're hanging. My decision.

744
01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:28.409
Don't move.
I'm coming to your studio.


745
01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:30.530
I'm not there. 
- Where are you?

746
01:19:30.739 --> 01:19:34.698
My old place on Hill Road.
- I'll find it.


747
01:19:34.699 --> 01:19:36.752
Save your breath.

748
01:19:36.753 --> 01:19:38.873
I played your game long enough.

749
01:19:39.082 --> 01:19:40.465
Morgan...

750
01:19:41.374 --> 01:19:43.739
Go to Hell.

751
01:19:52.428 --> 01:19:55.210
I'll take care of that
bitch once and for all.


752
01:20:01.469 --> 01:20:02.859
Sugar!

753
01:20:07.031 --> 01:20:09.113
Come on!

754
01:20:13.285 --> 01:20:15.025
What's up?

755
01:20:15.026 --> 01:20:17.772
You fooled around?
- I ain't going in there.


756
01:20:41.443 --> 01:20:43.078
Sugar? Sugar?

757
01:21:01.851 --> 01:21:04.075
Where you at, bitch?

758
01:25:48.046 --> 01:25:50.098
Morgan!

759
01:25:52.602 --> 01:25:55.348
Whore, I'll blow your heart out.

760
01:25:56.914 --> 01:26:00.559
What the hell are you?
What do you want from me?


761
01:26:02.646 --> 01:26:07.097
I swore to get you.
For Langston.


762
01:26:07.098 --> 01:26:08.905
Good evening, Mr. Morgan.

763
01:26:09.949 --> 01:26:14.325
Unfortunately,
our first meeting is also our last.


764
01:26:17.246 --> 01:26:19.507
You're on your own now, Morgan.

765
01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:24.548
Show us what a
great guy you are.


766
01:26:24.862 --> 01:26:27.153
All the others are dead.

767
01:26:28.092 --> 01:26:30.770
Only you remain.

768
01:27:08.868 --> 01:27:10.816
Help me! Help me! Help me!

769
01:27:16.345 --> 01:27:18.778
For God's sake, help me!

770
01:27:19.822 --> 01:27:21.903
Somebody help me!

771
01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:25.521
Celeste!

772
01:27:45.336 --> 01:27:50.064
Well, woman, you killed them all.
Nice and proper.


773
01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:54.232
One remains.

774
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:57.328
What are your plans for her?

775
01:27:57.642 --> 01:27:59.449
I was thinking

776
01:27:59.451 --> 01:28:03.618
Yes, the price I asked
for our arrangement.


777
01:28:03.619 --> 01:28:05.671
As cheap as that?

778
01:28:05.672 --> 01:28:09.252
I prefer you, of course,

779
01:28:09.775 --> 01:28:13.004
but she'll do for now.

780
01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:17.351
Goodbye, Sugar Hill.
A gift for you.


781
01:28:17.978 --> 01:28:19.890
Baron.

782
01:28:21.038 --> 01:28:23.432
Will you join me?

783
01:29:01.394 --> 01:29:03.550
It's over, Mama.

784
01:29:06.159 --> 01:29:08.279
You can rest now.

785
01:29:27.016 --> 01:29:33.308
