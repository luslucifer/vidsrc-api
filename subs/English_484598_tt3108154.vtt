Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:19.314
(energetic music)

4
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:31.321
(man screams)

5
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:40.078
(speaker is drowned out by music)

6
00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.082
(rapid gunfire)

7
00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:57.084
I got him.

8
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:01.888
Please, let go!

9
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.235
Please!

10
00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:04.070
Please!

11
00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:10.204
Please, please, please,
please don't do this.


12
00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:11.388
Please!

13
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.223
No!

14
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:15.532
Please, don't!

15
00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:20.741
No, no, please (screams).

16
00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:22.085
No, no!

17
00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:24.837
(birds chirping)

18
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:31.402
The gray wolf is a rare
sight to see in the wild,


19
00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:33.567
their numbers are
decreasing, but it is still


20
00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.468
one of the most elegant
predators in the world.


21
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.725
As a predator, the gray wolf is known

22
00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:41.028
for its unmatched ferocity.

23
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.820
In seconds, the wolf
can go from a calm state


24
00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:46.517
to a vicious beast,

25
00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:47.647
it won't rest until

26
00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.806
it's overcome its opponent.

27
00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:53.636
(life support machine beeps)

28
00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:55.388
How you doin', bud?

29
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.455
(breathes heavily) Like a million bucks.

30
00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:03.290
Where's Mom and Reese?

31
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.881
They went home a few hours ago,

32
00:02:06.883 --> 00:02:08.848
they wanted to be
here when you woke up,

33
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.381
but Mom had an appointment this morning.

34
00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:13.523
Morning, Kyle.

35
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:15.608
Glad to see you're awake.

36
00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:18.027
How's he doing, doc?

37
00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.927
Well, let's find out.

38
00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.346
(calm music)

39
00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:30.401
Everything's as we expected.

40
00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:33.097
So how long do I
have to be in here?

41
00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.892
We still have to run a few tests,

42
00:02:34.894 --> 00:02:37.394
so we'll have to wait and see.

43
00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:42.425
I'm sorry, I wish I had
better news to give you.


44
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.457
(sighs) Yeah, me too.

45
00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.676
I wanna get out
of here for a while.

46
00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:52.601
Kyle, are you gonna be okay?

47
00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:57.256
I'll be all right,
tell everyone I was okay.


48
00:02:57.258 --> 00:02:58.925
I'll walk you out.

49
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.452
(moves into mysterious music)

50
00:03:08.768 --> 00:03:11.268
(door creaks)

51
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.130
I take it you got my message?

52
00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:16.963
Yeah.

53
00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:17.965
Your wife?

54
00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:20.175
I thought it best that I knew

55
00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:22.955
what was going on before I told her.

56
00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:23.957
All right.

57
00:03:24.857 --> 00:03:27.687
We've been able to make some progress,

58
00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.909
but it's still getting worse.

59
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.828
What are our options?

60
00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:36.114
(sighs) That's what
I wanted to talk to you


61
00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:37.669
and your wife about.

62
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.269
Kyle is past the point of
traditional treatments.


63
00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:45.037
There is, however, an
experimental drug we can try.


64
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.872
So what's the catch?

65
00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:49.249
Your insurance.

66
00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:53.661
Insurance?

67
00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:56.243
They're gonna cover this.

68
00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:57.245
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:08.236
(dramatic music)

70
00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:55.981
You're gonna tell me where
you got this right now.


71
00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:57.883
Mom, don't worry about it.

72
00:04:57.885 --> 00:04:59.529
What's going on?

73
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:02.262
Look at what I found in Reese's room.

74
00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:05.853
Reese, you tell me where
you got this right now.


75
00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.004
I, I've been saving it up.

76
00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:09.506
Don't lie to me.

77
00:05:10.398 --> 00:05:12.669
You stole it, didn't you?

78
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:14.931
No, Mom, I didn't steal it.

79
00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:18.183
Then how did you get this much money?

80
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.041
Don't look at your dad for
help, just answer the question.


81
00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:22.876
Kate,

82
00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.707
I gave him the money, okay?

83
00:05:27.672 --> 00:05:28.505
What?

84
00:05:29.582 --> 00:05:31.405
He said he needed it.

85
00:05:31.407 --> 00:05:33.276
I gave it to him.

86
00:05:33.278 --> 00:05:35.762
(Kate sighs)

87
00:05:35.764 --> 00:05:38.543
You really don't take
anything seriously, do you?


88
00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:39.962
Oh, look, Kate.

89
00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.042
I'm sorry, Dad.

90
00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:44.673
You can take the money back.

91
00:05:44.675 --> 00:05:47.040
No, that's okay, you're
keeping that money.


92
00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:47.875
Kate.

93
00:05:52.158 --> 00:05:53.730
Kate.

94
00:05:53.732 --> 00:05:55.458
Look, I know I should've (Kate sighs)

95
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.262
told you about the money.

96
00:05:57.264 --> 00:05:59.265
You shouldn't have gave it
to him in the first place.


97
00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:01.437
Dean, what were you thinking?

98
00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.399
That our son deserves
to have a little extra.


99
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:06.269
You know we never do.

100
00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:08.991
I had a little extra cash.

101
00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.382
No, he wanted it, he didn't need it.

102
00:06:11.384 --> 00:06:12.446
Do you have any
idea what he's gonna spend

103
00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:14.031
that much money on?

104
00:06:15.098 --> 00:06:16.416
No.

105
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.526
Kyle is in the hospital,
we can barely afford


106
00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.082
to put food on our table,

107
00:06:21.084 --> 00:06:23.967
and you just give away money like that?

108
00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.479
I had a little extra.

109
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:28.440
There is no such thing
as extra for us right now.


110
00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:31.223
You can't give away
money that we don't have.


111
00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.936
If you do have extra money,

112
00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:35.540
that goes to stuff we need around here.

113
00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:37.289
You're gonna take it all back.

114
00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:38.588
Why are you being such a...

115
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.269
What, a bitch?

116
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:41.673
I didn't say that.

117
00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:42.764
Well, I am a bitch.

118
00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:43.834
And let me tell you something,

119
00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:46.632
I have to be a bitch to
keep this family together.


120
00:06:46.634 --> 00:06:48.706
You think I wanted to
raise my kids this way,


121
00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:52.400
having to fight and scrounge
for every last dollar?


122
00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:53.525
And in the face of it all we

123
00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:54.657
can be thrown out on the street,

124
00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:59.234
I find out my husband isn't
supporting me or this family.


125
00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:01.295
I'm doing the best
I can to support us!

126
00:07:01.297 --> 00:07:04.630
Clearly you're doing the best you can!

127
00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:07.541
You know this is gonna crush him.

128
00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:09.162
I know.

129
00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:11.811
I didn't say he didn't deserve it.

130
00:07:11.813 --> 00:07:14.803
We just cannot afford it right now.

131
00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:18.067
We're still a couple hundred
dollars short this month.


132
00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.541
If you give me that, you can
get him whatever you want.


133
00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:26.710
(bell gently chimes)
(Dean sighs)


134
00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:30.029
Reese.

135
00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:34.586
I'm gonna have to
hold on to that money.

136
00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:37.036
Knew Mom would screw this up!

137
00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:37.871
Reese!

138
00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:41.885
(Dean sighs)

139
00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:48.092
(dramatic music)

140
00:08:39.972 --> 00:08:41.496
Come out!

141
00:08:41.498 --> 00:08:45.665
(speaker is drowned out by music)

142
00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:10.729
(door creaks)

143
00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:17.337
(bell chimes gently)

144
00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:21.008
How's it goin' man?

145
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.293
So what you got for me?

146
00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.680
So I have a helmet.

147
00:09:23.682 --> 00:09:25.175
All right.

148
00:09:25.177 --> 00:09:26.760
Let's check it out.

149
00:09:28.557 --> 00:09:31.253
Yeah, it's in good condition, I mean.

150
00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:32.086
Yeah.

151
00:09:32.088 --> 00:09:33.914
I'll give you 150 for it.

152
00:09:33.916 --> 00:09:35.083
Really?

153
00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:36.008
Yeah.

154
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.019
This is an authentic army helmet.

155
00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:39.569
Yeah, where'd you get it?

156
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:41.142
It was my brother's.

157
00:09:41.144 --> 00:09:43.928
Okay, did he ever make it overseas?

158
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.418
They all go overseas at some point.

159
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.753
Yeah, did he make it back?

160
00:09:49.479 --> 00:09:51.729
I need $300 for the helmet.

161
00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:53.760
Yeah, uh, listen man, do you know

162
00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:56.776
of any army surplus stores around here?

163
00:09:56.778 --> 00:09:57.609
No.

164
00:09:57.611 --> 00:09:59.349
All right then, that
makes the buyer's market,


165
00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:04.348
I'm the buyer, I'm saying you're
only gettin' 150 for this.


166
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.767
(Dean sighs)

167
00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:13.248
(door creaks)

168
00:11:13.262 --> 00:11:15.679
(Dean sighs)

169
00:11:23.352 --> 00:11:25.545
All right, Dean, Charlie's
on vacation this week,


170
00:11:25.547 --> 00:11:27.738
so I want you
to work the game tonight.

171
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.176
Now they've got the
entire service themselves,


172
00:11:30.178 --> 00:11:33.011
you know the rules, don't
speak unless spoken to,


173
00:11:33.013 --> 00:11:34.840
(calm music)
and don't make eye contact.


174
00:11:34.842 --> 00:11:35.759
You got it?

175
00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:38.302
You better, Dean.

176
00:11:38.304 --> 00:11:39.275
I shouldn't have to tell you this,

177
00:11:39.277 --> 00:11:42.860
but if you screw up
out there, you're gone.


178
00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:48.002
So, I'm at the office today,

179
00:11:48.004 --> 00:11:49.697
fired us some prick.

180
00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:52.643
He's not going down without a fight.

181
00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:53.763
Nice.

182
00:11:53.765 --> 00:11:55.184
So did he scream, or just yell?

183
00:11:55.186 --> 00:11:57.379
No, he was kinda weird about it.

184
00:11:57.381 --> 00:11:58.738
I called him into the office,

185
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.357
break the news, and he's
just standing there,


186
00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:05.075
not saying a damn thing, like a statue.

187
00:12:05.077 --> 00:12:06.910
So what you do next?

188
00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:08.910
Well, the guy goes the leave

189
00:12:08.912 --> 00:12:12.520
and he turns to me and asks
me how I sleep at night.


190
00:12:12.522 --> 00:12:14.324
(chuckles)

191
00:12:14.326 --> 00:12:16.960
I said, look, I'm runnin' a business here,

192
00:12:16.962 --> 00:12:18.462
I'm not a charity.

193
00:12:19.611 --> 00:12:21.048
I bet he didn't like that, did he?

194
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.644
No, (chuckles), he didn't.

195
00:12:22.646 --> 00:12:25.869
So I said, look, you
did a good job here,

196
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:28.592
but the economy is not
what it used to be.

197
00:12:28.594 --> 00:12:30.081
Then he has the
nerve to talk to me

198
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.662
about how much I'm makin',

199
00:12:31.664 --> 00:12:33.851
in my own damn (chuckles) company.

200
00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:36.455
I give him a
little bit of free advice,

201
00:12:36.457 --> 00:12:40.357
I said, look, nobody's gonna
take care you but yourself,


202
00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.845
it don't matter if you're
making a mil a year


203
00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:43.597
or six bucks an hour.

204
00:12:44.487 --> 00:12:47.654
Gotta do what you gotta do to survive.

205
00:12:53.892 --> 00:12:56.059
Have a good night, Dean.

206
00:13:22.967 --> 00:13:25.884
(mysterious music)

207
00:13:27.456 --> 00:13:28.706
Price is 200.

208
00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:33.450
I just sold this to you
for 150 earlier today.


209
00:13:33.452 --> 00:13:35.783
Yeah, you sold it to
me, you didn't pawn it,


210
00:13:35.785 --> 00:13:39.952
and that means that I say the
price to get it back is 200.


211
00:13:41.872 --> 00:13:44.706
This is the last thing
I have of my brother's,


212
00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:46.541
he died in Iraq, 2008.

213
00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:50.600
It's touching.

214
00:13:50.602 --> 00:13:52.185
Price is still 200.

215
00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:56.393
(Dean sighs)

216
00:13:56.395 --> 00:13:57.797
Fine.

217
00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:58.632
Keep it.

218
00:14:07.255 --> 00:14:08.338
Reese, Reese.

219
00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:12.646
- (calm sad piano music)
- Yeah, Dad?


220
00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:13.868
Hey, bud.

221
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.620
Got this back for ya.

222
00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:18.795
But what about Mom?

223
00:14:18.797 --> 00:14:21.906
Just don't let her catch you.

224
00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:22.803
Okay.

225
00:14:22.805 --> 00:14:24.007
Okay?

226
00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:26.613
You know she loves you, right?

227
00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:27.663
I know.

228
00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:28.498
Okay.

229
00:14:29.522 --> 00:14:30.522
Sleep tight.

230
00:14:47.696 --> 00:14:48.529
Hey.

231
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.765
Got some money.

232
00:14:50.767 --> 00:14:54.965
Yeah, I'll just leave
it over to my window.


233
00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:55.800
Cool.

234
00:15:02.224 --> 00:15:03.808
(loud click)

235
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.477
(ominous music)

236
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.670
Where'd you get all this money?

237
00:15:28.672 --> 00:15:29.505
Work.

238
00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:32.764
How'd you get this much from work?

239
00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:36.081
You really wanna fight
about something else?


240
00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:37.929
No, I don't wanna fight at all,

241
00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:41.931
I just, I just wanna know
what we're doing here.


242
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:45.711
Taking it day by day.

243
00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:47.675
Like we always have.

244
00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:50.711
You can see where
that's gotten us, Dean.


245
00:15:50.713 --> 00:15:52.345
I don't want our kids
to grow up in trailers


246
00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:54.680
for the rest of their lives.

247
00:15:55.935 --> 00:15:59.920
Look, I don't want our kids
to grow up in trailers either,


248
00:15:59.922 --> 00:16:01.831
but I'm doing the best I can.

249
00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:03.154
Are you?

250
00:16:03.156 --> 00:16:05.939
Are you really doing the best you can?

251
00:16:05.941 --> 00:16:09.856
Well what exactly is it
that you've been doing?


252
00:16:09.858 --> 00:16:11.458
What?

253
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.637
Do you think there's jobs out there

254
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:15.922
that'll pay good money
for a guy like me?

255
00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:19.132
I've looked, there's nothing there.

256
00:16:19.134 --> 00:16:20.994
Well, I'll just add
up to the list of things


257
00:16:20.996 --> 00:16:23.446
(moves into scary music)
that you can't do.


258
00:16:23.448 --> 00:16:24.448
Just stop!

259
00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:29.404
Getting fired from your last job,

260
00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:32.906
working in a bar,
washing out of the army.

261
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.851
- (glass breaks)
- Shut the hell up!


262
00:16:35.853 --> 00:16:39.285
I'm tired of you always starting the shit!

263
00:16:39.287 --> 00:16:40.248
Fine!

264
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.400
I went to the army and washed out,

265
00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:47.003
I couldn't even make it
through basic boot camp.


266
00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.363
I'm a loser!

267
00:16:48.365 --> 00:16:50.234
I'm a piece of shit loser!

268
00:16:50.236 --> 00:16:53.403
That's what you wanted to hear, right?

269
00:17:03.137 --> 00:17:05.054
Oh, oh Reese, oh God!

270
00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:07.258
Let me see.

271
00:17:08.313 --> 00:17:10.011
Oh, you're gonna need stitches,

272
00:17:10.013 --> 00:17:12.509
come here, come here, let's go.

273
00:17:12.511 --> 00:17:13.642
Let's get your shoes.

274
00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:15.030
Should go in here.

275
00:17:15.032 --> 00:17:16.152
You can't leave.

276
00:17:16.154 --> 00:17:17.422
Yeah.

277
00:17:17.424 --> 00:17:18.257
Aw.

278
00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:23.494
(Reese whimpers)

279
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.756
(breathes heavily)

280
00:17:32.114 --> 00:17:35.233
(life support system beeps)

281
00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:36.572
- (calm music)
- Check it out, bro.


282
00:17:36.574 --> 00:17:38.615
Woah, bet there was a lot of blood.

283
00:17:38.617 --> 00:17:41.390
Yeah, I did get 15 stitches.

284
00:17:41.392 --> 00:17:42.950
Didn't cry, did ya?

285
00:17:42.952 --> 00:17:44.285
Of course not.

286
00:17:45.996 --> 00:17:48.496
Hey, I have something for you.

287
00:17:49.565 --> 00:17:50.398
What?

288
00:17:52.232 --> 00:17:55.096
Oh, thanks bro, where'd you get it?

289
00:17:55.098 --> 00:17:57.211
From one of the kids down the street.

290
00:17:57.213 --> 00:18:00.046
I finally had enough money for it.

291
00:18:00.964 --> 00:18:03.046
Where'd you get the money for it?

292
00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.407
I have my tricks.

293
00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:05.401
Dad?

294
00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:06.236
Yeah.

295
00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:09.756
Just don't tell him.

296
00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:10.591
Okay.

297
00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:14.913
Hey, so where's Dad?

298
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.945
Well, he's back at the house.

299
00:18:17.947 --> 00:18:19.547
Will he be coming tonight?

300
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:21.466
Um, I don't think so.

301
00:18:22.993 --> 00:18:24.721
I'm sorry that I hurt my foot.

302
00:18:24.723 --> 00:18:28.938
Hey, you know that we can't
afford this kind of stuff?


303
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.015
Hey!

304
00:18:30.017 --> 00:18:32.834
Hey, don't talk like that.

305
00:18:32.836 --> 00:18:35.116
It's not your fault.

306
00:18:35.118 --> 00:18:36.785
It's nobody's fault.

307
00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:40.170
Just life sometimes

308
00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:44.589
and it does not mean that I
don't love you or your dad.


309
00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:48.424
It just means you need
to try a little harder.


310
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:53.193
Everything is gonna be okay, I promise.

311
00:18:53.195 --> 00:18:56.112
So, is that what the money was for?

312
00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.139
If you want, I'll
just give it right back.


313
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.078
No way!

314
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.109
Got any songs on it yet?

315
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:05.769
No, not yet.

316
00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:06.874
I think that we can download some

317
00:19:06.876 --> 00:19:08.797
for free on the Internet.

318
00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:11.417
Cool, what are we gonna download first?

319
00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:14.002
I don't know, let's find out.

320
00:19:15.395 --> 00:19:17.328
Yeah, I'm seeing some old ones.

321
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.286
Nice.

322
00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:19.119
(Reese chuckles)

323
00:19:19.121 --> 00:19:20.405
Old, hey, what do you mean, old?

324
00:19:20.407 --> 00:19:22.012
(children laugh)

325
00:19:22.014 --> 00:19:24.931
Ah, oh, I mean the ones
that were, you listened to.


326
00:19:24.933 --> 00:19:27.430
Thanks, yeah! (Reese laughs)

327
00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:29.768
I'm just joking, Mom.

328
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.353
(dreamy music)

329
00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:47.658
(yawns)

330
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.956
Good morning, Dad.

331
00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.006
- Okay.
- Hi, bud.


332
00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:51.091
Good night.

333
00:19:53.255 --> 00:19:54.373
Hey.

334
00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:55.454
Hi.

335
00:19:55.456 --> 00:19:56.617
I'm sorry about...

336
00:19:56.619 --> 00:19:58.202
No, look, me too.

337
00:19:59.268 --> 00:20:00.953
(Kate sighs)

338
00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:04.455
Kate, I have something
I need to tell you.

339
00:20:05.848 --> 00:20:07.664
What is it, Dean?

340
00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:11.364
Apparently the insurance
for Kyle's medical bills


341
00:20:11.366 --> 00:20:14.470
are just, they're not
gonna cover him anymore.


342
00:20:14.472 --> 00:20:16.518
They're all gonna fall on us.

343
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.760
What do you mean?

344
00:20:17.762 --> 00:20:19.082
We can't afford that.

345
00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:20.746
They have to cover him!

346
00:20:20.748 --> 00:20:23.011
I'm not sure, but we're
gonna figure this out.


347
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.402
Look, I will do whatever it takes,

348
00:20:26.404 --> 00:20:29.169
we're not gonna let our son die.

349
00:20:29.171 --> 00:20:31.092
I don't know what to do.

350
00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:34.517
Kate, look, Kate, look, I love you,

351
00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:36.624
I have always loved you,

352
00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:39.555
I'm not gonna let this
tear our family apart.


353
00:20:39.557 --> 00:20:42.236
(Kate sobs) Just have faith and believe,

354
00:20:42.238 --> 00:20:45.214
and we will get through this.

355
00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:46.267
Okay?

356
00:20:46.269 --> 00:20:48.026
I love you, Kate.

357
00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:49.528
I love you, too.

358
00:20:56.025 --> 00:20:58.858
(energetic music)

359
00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.884
Been a long night, guys.

360
00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:03.803
I'm all in.

361
00:21:04.734 --> 00:21:06.067
Well, I'm out.

362
00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.360
I'll call you on it,

363
00:21:10.362 --> 00:21:11.779
see what you got.

364
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.270
(sighs)

365
00:21:25.598 --> 00:21:28.348
(dramatic music)

366
00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:31.116
Dean.

367
00:21:31.118 --> 00:21:34.285
You need to empty your pockets for me.

368
00:23:00.407 --> 00:23:02.235
Get in the car.

369
00:23:02.237 --> 00:23:03.070
No.

370
00:23:04.568 --> 00:23:06.235
Wasn't a question.

371
00:23:34.186 --> 00:23:38.353
(ominous music)
(loud chirping)


372
00:23:52.776 --> 00:23:55.359
(loud banging)

373
00:24:08.752 --> 00:24:09.835
Come with me.

374
00:24:12.583 --> 00:24:15.270
He doesn't like to be kept waiting.

375
00:24:15.272 --> 00:24:18.855
(energetic frenzied music)

376
00:24:26.516 --> 00:24:29.933
(moves into scary music)

377
00:24:34.187 --> 00:24:35.020
Drink?

378
00:24:37.608 --> 00:24:40.560
I like to make my guests
their drink personal.


379
00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:42.665
So what's it gonna be?

380
00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:45.421
You the guy that
busted me at the bar?

381
00:24:45.423 --> 00:24:46.528
Didn't take a bunch of rich pricks

382
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.321
to notice you've taken
a few hundred dollars


383
00:24:48.323 --> 00:24:51.356
are down in the (mumbles).

384
00:24:51.358 --> 00:24:53.839
Name is Sam, by the way.

385
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:55.426
You're Dean.

386
00:24:55.428 --> 00:24:56.789
How'd you know my name?

387
00:24:56.791 --> 00:24:58.639
I know everything about you.

388
00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:01.607
Wasn't hard to figure out, really.

389
00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:04.442
Now Dean, don't make me ask again.

390
00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:06.526
I'm good.

391
00:25:08.046 --> 00:25:11.656
What's the best drink
you've ever had in life?


392
00:25:11.658 --> 00:25:13.241
Really, I'm fine.

393
00:25:14.573 --> 00:25:15.906
Tell you what,

394
00:25:16.888 --> 00:25:20.077
give you something I know
you've never had before.


395
00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:23.655
It's called Louis XIII
(drink splashes in glass).


396
00:25:23.657 --> 00:25:24.488
(glass thuds on table) Bet you never even

397
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.411
heard of this stuff before, haven't you?

398
00:25:27.413 --> 00:25:28.246
No.

399
00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:31.571
Didn't think so (drink
splashes in glass).


400
00:25:31.573 --> 00:25:32.882
This glass here (glass thuds
on table) probably cost more


401
00:25:32.884 --> 00:25:35.388
than you make in a month.

402
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.557
This bottle alone, 75,013.

403
00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:45.568
Damn good stuff.

404
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:46.470
Wouldn't want to waste a drink

405
00:25:46.472 --> 00:25:49.222
from a $13,000 bottle, would you?

406
00:25:50.461 --> 00:25:53.128
Tell me, Dean, why are you here?

407
00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:55.333
You tell me.

408
00:25:56.922 --> 00:26:01.100
I think you know
exactly why you're here.


409
00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:02.840
(Dean sighs)

410
00:26:02.842 --> 00:26:06.939
Well, at first I thought you
brought me here to kill me.


411
00:26:06.941 --> 00:26:10.047
(chuckles) Let's not get
too far ahead of ourselves.


412
00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:12.934
Have a couple of questions for you.

413
00:26:12.936 --> 00:26:15.019
Why'd you do it?

414
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:16.725
I don't owe you anything.

415
00:26:16.727 --> 00:26:18.477
No, I think you do.

416
00:26:22.423 --> 00:26:25.996
Well if you have me so
figured out, it should be easy.


417
00:26:25.998 --> 00:26:27.843
A sick kid in the hospital,

418
00:26:27.845 --> 00:26:31.735
another kid and a wife
at home, in this economy.


419
00:26:31.737 --> 00:26:32.737
Hear that.

420
00:26:33.604 --> 00:26:36.566
This nation's been hurting.

421
00:26:36.568 --> 00:26:38.985
Lord knows I had to cut back.

422
00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:46.235
I could sense it in you
the first time I saw you,


423
00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:48.071
could see the desperation.

424
00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:50.557
See, I like a desperate man.

425
00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:53.850
Most men are predictable,
but the desperate man,


426
00:26:53.852 --> 00:26:57.497
you never can tell how he's gonna act.

427
00:26:57.499 --> 00:26:59.757
Well, it's not like I have
piles of money laying around


428
00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:01.176
like some people.

429
00:27:02.017 --> 00:27:05.040
I have real life problems to deal with.

430
00:27:05.042 --> 00:27:09.633
There's nothing special about
you or your problems, Dean.


431
00:27:09.635 --> 00:27:12.098
Well if there's
nothing special about me,


432
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.267
I guess I'll be on my way.

433
00:27:16.819 --> 00:27:19.952
I brought in (glass thuds
on table) for a reason.


434
00:27:19.954 --> 00:27:21.954
Like to offer you a job.

435
00:27:24.252 --> 00:27:26.002
What kind of a job?

436
00:27:27.463 --> 00:27:30.064
More of an opportunity.

437
00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:33.899
(ominous music)
Sit back down.


438
00:27:39.705 --> 00:27:42.648
See, I belong to
a select group of people,

439
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.781
I've traveled all over the world,

440
00:27:45.783 --> 00:27:49.950
I've hunted some of the most
exotic animals in existence.


441
00:27:54.335 --> 00:27:57.494
My offer to you is as follows,

442
00:27:57.496 --> 00:28:00.990
I'll take you into the
wilderness for seven days,


443
00:28:00.992 --> 00:28:04.048
from the first sunrise to the last sunset,

444
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.383
I will hunt you.

445
00:28:06.429 --> 00:28:09.264
You'll be permitted to defend yourself,

446
00:28:09.266 --> 00:28:12.423
but you won't receive any assistance.

447
00:28:12.425 --> 00:28:16.141
On the eighth day, I'll
transfer one million dollars


448
00:28:16.143 --> 00:28:18.907
into the bank account of your choosing,

449
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:21.326
whether you're alive or dead.

450
00:28:23.073 --> 00:28:25.220
(sighs) You're sick.

451
00:28:25.222 --> 00:28:28.813
What, it's not enough to
have all of this money,


452
00:28:28.815 --> 00:28:30.832
you've got to play God?

453
00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:31.751
Is that it?

454
00:28:33.092 --> 00:28:34.792
I'm just a hunter,

455
00:28:34.794 --> 00:28:37.745
trying to hunt the ultimate game.

456
00:28:37.747 --> 00:28:38.957
I'm not gonna stick around to listen

457
00:28:38.959 --> 00:28:40.803
to this sickening speech anymore.

458
00:28:40.805 --> 00:28:42.749
Think about it (Dean sighs).

459
00:28:42.751 --> 00:28:46.918
I'm offering you enough money
to change your life forever.


460
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.218
That's what I don't get about you people.

461
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.012
You get every opportunity in the world

462
00:28:54.014 --> 00:28:57.270
and you're just too stupid to take it.

463
00:28:57.272 --> 00:28:59.070
Go home, Dean,

464
00:28:59.072 --> 00:29:02.246
look at your kids, your wife,

465
00:29:02.248 --> 00:29:05.329
and know that no
matter how hard you work,

466
00:29:05.331 --> 00:29:06.453
the best life that you're gonna be able

467
00:29:06.455 --> 00:29:09.400
to create for them is
the same sad pathetic one


468
00:29:09.402 --> 00:29:11.464
you're living now.

469
00:29:11.466 --> 00:29:13.216
You think about that.

470
00:29:16.515 --> 00:29:18.515
I'll be seeing you soon!

471
00:29:23.877 --> 00:29:24.710
Dean.

472
00:29:29.045 --> 00:29:30.295
Take this card.

473
00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:33.902
In case you change your mind.

474
00:29:33.904 --> 00:29:38.071
The men outside will take
you anywhere you wanna go.


475
00:29:42.297 --> 00:29:44.965
He always gets what he wants.

476
00:29:44.967 --> 00:29:45.800
Always.

477
00:29:57.258 --> 00:29:58.581
(sad guitar music)

478
00:29:58.583 --> 00:29:59.790
Hey!

479
00:29:59.792 --> 00:30:00.913
Hey!

480
00:30:00.915 --> 00:30:02.430
Hey!

481
00:30:02.432 --> 00:30:04.382
What the hell are you doing?

482
00:30:04.384 --> 00:30:07.568
Oh, what, like you
didn't think I'd find out?


483
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.849
Kate, wait, look, 
I can fix this,

484
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:12.428
you just have to give me some time.

485
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:13.532
Dean, I don't care,

486
00:30:13.534 --> 00:30:14.903
I don't care where you've been all night

487
00:30:14.905 --> 00:30:16.534
and I don't care
what you have to say.

488
00:30:16.536 --> 00:30:17.369
I'm done!

489
00:30:18.407 --> 00:30:20.101
Kate, you can't do this to me,

490
00:30:20.103 --> 00:30:22.531
I can't lose you and the kids.

491
00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:23.364
Please!

492
00:30:23.366 --> 00:30:24.197
Well, I can't keep being the only person

493
00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:27.478
who takes care of this family.

494
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.311
(door slams)

495
00:30:28.313 --> 00:30:30.460
Kate, give me a chance,

496
00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:31.999
I can make this right.

497
00:30:32.001 --> 00:30:33.665
Please.

498
00:30:33.667 --> 00:30:36.101
Fine, but you better fix this, Dean,

499
00:30:36.103 --> 00:30:37.582
you better make it right,

500
00:30:37.584 --> 00:30:38.857
you better start taking
care of this family,


501
00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:40.256
because if you don't,

502
00:30:40.258 --> 00:30:43.725
I will find someone who
will (car engine rumbles).


503
00:30:43.727 --> 00:30:44.560
Kate.

504
00:30:45.541 --> 00:30:46.374
What?

505
00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:35.469
(dramatic music)

506
00:31:42.615 --> 00:31:45.152
Should I get someone to
interpret that for you?


507
00:31:45.154 --> 00:31:46.904
No, just one thing.

508
00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:49.442
What is it?

509
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.677
I want cash.

510
00:31:52.617 --> 00:31:54.982
Whatever works for you.

511
00:31:54.984 --> 00:31:55.984
All right.

512
00:32:01.851 --> 00:32:02.682
(loud slap)

513
00:32:02.684 --> 00:32:06.372
Welcome to the hunt (Dean sighs).

514
00:32:06.374 --> 00:32:09.041
(ominous music)

515
00:32:25.398 --> 00:32:28.315
(breathes heavily)

516
00:32:34.378 --> 00:32:35.911
What?

517
00:32:35.913 --> 00:32:38.917
You thought I was gonna be alone?

518
00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:41.573
A thing you have to
remember about this hunt,


519
00:32:41.575 --> 00:32:45.075
I can use any
means necessary to kill you.

520
00:32:49.464 --> 00:32:52.275
A few minutes before sunup, Dean.

521
00:32:52.277 --> 00:32:53.108
(leaves rustle)

522
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.443
I suggest you start running.

523
00:32:59.672 --> 00:33:02.422
(dramatic music)

524
00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:10.703
(breathes heavily)

525
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.123
(loud gunshot)

526
00:33:53.646 --> 00:33:56.396
(birds chirping)

527
00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:20.544
(energetic music)

528
00:34:20.546 --> 00:34:21.926
All right, boys, I got him.

529
00:34:21.928 --> 00:34:25.095
He's heading east towards the river.

530
00:34:42.775 --> 00:34:45.211
Making this too easy on us, Dean!

531
00:34:45.213 --> 00:34:47.880
(rapid gunfire)

532
00:34:56.102 --> 00:34:58.852
(water splashes)

533
00:35:10.779 --> 00:35:13.696
(breathes heavily)

534
00:35:27.712 --> 00:35:30.462
(birds chirping)

535
00:35:40.698 --> 00:35:43.721
(sharp whistling)

536
00:35:43.723 --> 00:35:46.023
(dog grunts)

537
00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:47.025
Right, go.

538
00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:50.533
Go find him, right?

539
00:35:50.535 --> 00:35:52.118
Go find him, go on!

540
00:35:54.728 --> 00:35:57.395
(ominous music)

541
00:37:50.916 --> 00:37:53.666
(intense growls)

542
00:37:54.921 --> 00:37:57.254
(dogs bark)

543
00:38:08.836 --> 00:38:12.003
- What the hell happened here?
- Quiet!


544
00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.453
(intense howling)

545
00:38:30.277 --> 00:38:33.027
(birds chirping)

546
00:38:34.942 --> 00:38:37.692
(dramatic music)

547
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.527
(leaves rustle)

548
00:39:46.564 --> 00:39:50.314
(energetic electronic music)

549
00:40:35.144 --> 00:40:37.811
(rapid gunfire)

550
00:40:42.613 --> 00:40:44.465
Damn (breathes heavily).

551
00:40:44.467 --> 00:40:46.442
Jason, come in.

552
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:47.567
(walkie talkie clicks) This is Jason.

553
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:48.559
We heard a shot.

554
00:40:48.561 --> 00:40:49.392
Did you get him?

555
00:40:49.394 --> 00:40:50.225
(walkie talkie clicks)
Negative, he's heading east,


556
00:40:50.227 --> 00:40:51.322
I'm going after him.

557
00:40:51.324 --> 00:40:52.489
(walkie talkie clicks) Copy that.

558
00:40:52.491 --> 00:40:56.658
Found something you're
gonna wanna check out first.


559
00:40:58.754 --> 00:41:02.411
You think this is where they got in?

560
00:41:02.413 --> 00:41:03.547
Yeah, one probably
came over to to that tree


561
00:41:03.549 --> 00:41:07.035
looking for food, and
these grounds are empty.


562
00:41:07.037 --> 00:41:09.534
The guards didn't stop him coming in?

563
00:41:09.536 --> 00:41:10.958
Its job to keep stuff from getting out,

564
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.627
not from getting in.

565
00:41:15.176 --> 00:41:17.701
What are we gonna do about it?

566
00:41:17.703 --> 00:41:19.312
What you all so worried about?

567
00:41:19.314 --> 00:41:21.688
This adds more fun to the game.

568
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.559
That's right.

569
00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:25.478
Part of the hunt now.

570
00:41:34.007 --> 00:41:36.639
(breathes heavily)

571
00:41:36.641 --> 00:41:37.614
All right.

572
00:41:37.616 --> 00:41:40.283
(loud clinking)

573
00:41:59.151 --> 00:41:59.984
Oh.

574
00:42:02.472 --> 00:42:06.204
(breathes heavily)

575
00:42:06.206 --> 00:42:08.623
(loud thuds)

576
00:42:09.973 --> 00:42:12.390
(wood snaps)

577
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.760
(dramatic music)

578
00:42:51.762 --> 00:42:55.929
(rope creaks)
(screams)


579
00:42:57.593 --> 00:43:00.343
(birds chirping)

580
00:43:06.879 --> 00:43:10.046
(intense sharp music)

581
00:43:20.707 --> 00:43:23.624
(breathes heavily)

582
00:43:28.627 --> 00:43:30.710
(grunts)

583
00:43:53.452 --> 00:43:55.619
(screams)

584
00:44:02.724 --> 00:44:03.557
Damn.

585
00:44:04.681 --> 00:44:06.384
Just missed him.

586
00:44:06.386 --> 00:44:08.386
Couldn't gone too far.

587
00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:30.996
Any sign of him?

588
00:44:30.998 --> 00:44:32.363
Nah, I looked all around,

589
00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:33.928
couldn't find any tracks.

590
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:35.183
You did?

591
00:44:35.185 --> 00:44:37.740
Guess that means I've better check it out.

592
00:44:37.742 --> 00:44:39.474
What, you think I can't track?

593
00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.768
I know you can.

594
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:44.020
Anyway, looks like we're getting close.

595
00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:47.758
Got some food.

596
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.835
Yeah, we shouldn't let that out.

597
00:44:49.837 --> 00:44:51.863
It's all right, I like 'em
when they get a little food


598
00:44:51.865 --> 00:44:54.782
in 'em, makes 'em more fun to hunt.

599
00:44:57.076 --> 00:44:59.507
It's getting late, let's go and eat here.

600
00:44:59.509 --> 00:45:01.652
All right, I'm with Carl.

601
00:45:01.654 --> 00:45:04.340
So what are we doing
tonight, steak or lobster?


602
00:45:04.342 --> 00:45:07.342
(crickets chirping)

603
00:45:13.241 --> 00:45:16.444
We might've underestimated
this one, Sam.


604
00:45:16.446 --> 00:45:17.516
How so?

605
00:45:17.518 --> 00:45:19.181
(fire crackles)

606
00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:22.019
We've been hunting
this guy for two days,


607
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:23.838
and he's still breathing.

608
00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.485
- (scary music)
- Let me ask you something,


609
00:45:25.487 --> 00:45:29.558
besides this, what's
the best animal to hunt?


610
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.198
Best?

611
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.867
One should say most difficult.

612
00:45:34.973 --> 00:45:38.001
Land, it's a lion, not too long ago,

613
00:45:38.003 --> 00:45:40.356
(mumbles) weren't difficult.

614
00:45:40.358 --> 00:45:43.149
Rhino, believe it or not.

615
00:45:43.151 --> 00:45:44.345
They're easy enough to track down,

616
00:45:44.347 --> 00:45:46.777
but once they start to charge,

617
00:45:46.779 --> 00:45:49.905
they don't stop until it's over.

618
00:45:49.907 --> 00:45:51.509
Elephant,

619
00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:55.984
same with the rhino, they're
easy enough to track down,


620
00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:58.319
but that's one smart animal.

621
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:04.524
What's the one thing those
animals have in common?


622
00:46:04.526 --> 00:46:05.526
Desperation,

623
00:46:06.554 --> 00:46:08.255
the most dangerous time
to approach an animal


624
00:46:08.257 --> 00:46:09.642
is when they're down,

625
00:46:09.644 --> 00:46:12.990
that's when they're the most desperate.

626
00:46:12.992 --> 00:46:15.629
You asked me why I chose this man,

627
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:18.200
he lives in desperation,

628
00:46:18.202 --> 00:46:21.564
combine that with his military training,

629
00:46:21.566 --> 00:46:24.066
you have one hell of a hunter.

630
00:46:36.142 --> 00:46:38.559
(wolf howls)

631
00:46:42.298 --> 00:46:44.965
(intense music)

632
00:47:04.247 --> 00:47:08.414
(loud gunshots)
(dogs bark violently)


633
00:47:10.047 --> 00:47:12.547
(man screams)

634
00:47:18.663 --> 00:47:21.958
(dramatic electronic music)

635
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.627
(loud chirping)

636
00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:34.282
(breathes heavily)

637
00:48:00.015 --> 00:48:02.098
(grunts)

638
00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:47.147
Ah, is anyone home?

639
00:49:47.149 --> 00:49:48.149
I need help.

640
00:49:49.383 --> 00:49:51.250
(bangs on door) Hello!

641
00:49:51.252 --> 00:49:53.919
(bangs on door)

642
00:49:55.323 --> 00:49:56.154
Hello?

643
00:49:56.156 --> 00:49:59.104
(door creaks) Is anyone home?

644
00:49:59.106 --> 00:50:00.106
I need help.

645
00:50:01.869 --> 00:50:02.702
Hello?

646
00:50:07.382 --> 00:50:11.549
(energetic music)
(door creaks)


647
00:50:21.732 --> 00:50:24.482
(water splashes)

648
00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:46.669
(telephone keys beep)

649
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:50.032
(continuous rhythmic busy phone tone)

650
00:50:50.034 --> 00:50:53.723
(telephone keys beep)

651
00:50:53.725 --> 00:50:56.116
(continuous rhythmic busy phone tone)

652
00:50:56.118 --> 00:50:58.118
(sighs)

653
00:51:06.919 --> 00:51:09.836
(breathes heavily)

654
00:51:42.154 --> 00:51:44.487
(loud buzz)

655
00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:48.228
(intense music)

656
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.980
(garbled speech)

657
00:51:52.741 --> 00:51:53.574
Woo!

658
00:51:54.745 --> 00:51:55.995
Ah, let's go!

659
00:51:57.811 --> 00:51:59.330
(laughing)

660
00:51:59.332 --> 00:52:02.565
Come on, come on I got him!

661
00:52:02.567 --> 00:52:03.796
Come on!

662
00:52:03.798 --> 00:52:07.215
(dramatic music)
Come on!


663
00:52:08.761 --> 00:52:11.317
(engine growls)

664
00:52:11.319 --> 00:52:12.360
Come on!

665
00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:13.195
Come on!

666
00:52:16.157 --> 00:52:16.988
Hey!

667
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.821
Woo hoo!

668
00:52:17.823 --> 00:52:19.162
(man laughs)

669
00:52:19.164 --> 00:52:20.164
I got him.

670
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:25.030
Please!

671
00:52:25.032 --> 00:52:26.647
- Hell yeah!
- Let me go!


672
00:52:26.649 --> 00:52:28.215
- Please!
- Nice shot!


673
00:52:28.217 --> 00:52:29.217
Don't, no!

674
00:52:30.205 --> 00:52:31.455
Please, please!

675
00:52:32.746 --> 00:52:33.724
No!

676
00:52:33.726 --> 00:52:34.733
No!

677
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.171
Okay!

678
00:52:36.173 --> 00:52:37.352
Please!

679
00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:39.937
(Dean screams)

680
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.593
Guys.

681
00:53:44.705 --> 00:53:47.288
(loud gunshot)

682
00:53:53.645 --> 00:53:54.766
Why don't we just call somebody

683
00:53:54.768 --> 00:53:56.809
and have him taken out?

684
00:53:56.811 --> 00:53:58.376
We already have, they won't be here

685
00:53:58.378 --> 00:53:59.710
for a few days.

686
00:53:59.712 --> 00:54:02.169
I'm not willing to wait that long.

687
00:54:02.171 --> 00:54:04.365
I'm saying no, it's going
to be getting dark soon,


688
00:54:04.367 --> 00:54:07.685
we should eat first
before we go out there.


689
00:54:07.687 --> 00:54:08.946
You two don't have the slightest clue

690
00:54:08.948 --> 00:54:10.762
of what's going on here, do you?

691
00:54:10.764 --> 00:54:13.927
Dean has evidence, actual video evidence

692
00:54:13.929 --> 00:54:15.711
of what goes on out here.

693
00:54:15.713 --> 00:54:16.812
So what?

694
00:54:16.814 --> 00:54:18.199
He goes to the cops and the organization

695
00:54:18.201 --> 00:54:20.072
will take care of it.

696
00:54:20.074 --> 00:54:21.790
Oh, they'll take care of it.

697
00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:23.757
Then they'll care of us.

698
00:54:23.759 --> 00:54:27.926
You know the rules, anything
gets out, we're responsible.


699
00:54:29.128 --> 00:54:31.460
So shut the hell up and get ready.

700
00:54:31.462 --> 00:54:32.795
We're going now.

701
00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:40.069
(dramatic music)

702
00:54:40.071 --> 00:54:42.821
(birds chirping)

703
00:56:44.913 --> 00:56:45.746
Stop!

704
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.027
Are you with them?

705
00:56:50.643 --> 00:56:52.197
You gotta help me.

706
00:56:52.199 --> 00:56:54.433
There's people in here trying to kill me.

707
00:56:54.435 --> 00:56:56.735
Return to the hunting grounds.

708
00:56:56.737 --> 00:56:57.568
Get back!

709
00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:00.237
(rapid gunfire)

710
00:57:20.177 --> 00:57:23.769
Hunting party, come in
(walkie talkie rings).


711
00:57:23.771 --> 00:57:27.938
Hunting party, over.
(walkie talkie rings).


712
00:57:28.974 --> 00:57:30.408
Think it's him?

713
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:31.410
Has to be.

714
00:57:33.231 --> 00:57:34.062
Think he tried to get through,

715
00:57:34.064 --> 00:57:35.935
they must've stopped him.

716
00:57:35.937 --> 00:57:36.770
Right.

717
00:57:37.836 --> 00:57:39.713
I think we should
go back to the cabin.

718
00:57:39.715 --> 00:57:41.175
We're huntin' through the night.

719
00:57:41.177 --> 00:57:45.728
How the hell we're supposed
to follow footprints at night?


720
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:47.647
Guys, check this out.

721
00:57:57.277 --> 00:58:00.610

Woo!

Woo!

(ominous music)

733
01:00:35.307 --> 01:00:37.188
You find him, don't hesitate to shoot.

734
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:39.554
Keep in mind, we need
to bring him back alive.


735
01:00:39.556 --> 01:00:41.716
Won't the guards get
suspicious if we don't kill him?


736
01:00:41.718 --> 01:00:43.368
Oh, we're gonna kill him, all right,

737
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:45.545
we gotta get those DVDs back first.

738
01:00:45.547 --> 01:00:46.746
Besides, they don't care,

739
01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:48.413
they're just here to keep the hunt going.

740

811
01:09:25.744 --> 01:09:27.221
Think it's a trap?

812
01:09:27.223 --> 01:09:29.387
Oh, I know it is.

813
01:09:29.389 --> 01:09:31.639
But we don't have a choice.

814
01:09:32.572 --> 01:09:34.579
We could just leave him.

815
01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:35.414
Thomas?

816
01:09:36.361 --> 01:09:38.792
Just let him die out here like Luke?

817
01:09:38.794 --> 01:09:41.961
Dean's got him, he's
probably dead anyway.


818
01:09:41.963 --> 01:09:45.380
Either way, we still have to find Dean.

819
01:10:33.537 --> 01:10:35.037
What's the plan?

820
01:10:36.436 --> 01:10:40.021
He's hiding in the area somewhere.

821
01:10:40.023 --> 01:10:42.726
What kind of weapons does he have left?

822
01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:43.645
Not sure.

823
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.510
A few knives and at least one rifle.

824
01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:50.745
Probably a few grenades.

825
01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:51.752
All right.

826
01:10:51.754 --> 01:10:53.310
I'm gonna go into the cave,

827
01:10:53.312 --> 01:10:55.013
you keep watch out here.

828
01:10:55.015 --> 01:10:57.011

If you see anything at all.

830
01:10:59.628 --> 01:11:03.128
I'm not gonna let
him bury you in there.

Where is he?

836
01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:31.210
Don't know.

837
01:12:31.212 --> 01:12:35.379
Dragged me here last night,
I didn't see anything since.


838
01:12:46.469 --> 01:12:49.136
(rapid gunfire)

839
01:12:50.985 --> 01:12:51.818
Jason?

840
01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:09.873
(rapid gunfire)
(man groans)


841
01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:13.369
A second, don't leave me here.

842
01:13:13.371 --> 01:13:17.038
Don't leave me here (sobs).

843
01:13:22.316 --> 01:13:23.755
(birds chirping)

844
01:13:23.757 --> 01:13:24.590
Jason?

845
01:13:26.198 --> 01:13:27.031
Jason?

846
01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:31.371
(ominous music)

847
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.693
(man groans)

848
01:13:37.695 --> 01:13:39.638
What, were you just
gonna leave me down there?


849
01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.072
Jason's dead.

850
01:13:41.074 --> 01:13:42.725
Jesus.

851
01:13:42.727 --> 01:13:43.734
We've gotta go.

852
01:13:43.736 --> 01:13:44.819
Can you move?

853
01:13:45.828 --> 01:13:47.411
Yeah, I think so.

854
01:13:49.499 --> 01:13:51.582
(groans)

855
01:13:53.911 --> 01:13:54.744
Ah, shit.

856
01:13:56.602 --> 01:13:57.900
We've gotta move.

857
01:13:57.902 --> 01:14:00.152
(groaning)

858
01:14:33.693 --> 01:14:36.360
(rapid gunfire)

859
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:06.301
Samuel, Samuel, don't leave me!

860
01:15:06.303 --> 01:15:09.553
Samuel, Samuel (sobs).

861
01:15:17.497 --> 01:15:19.997
Who's the desperate one now?

862
01:15:30.182 --> 01:15:32.849
(rapid gunfire)

863
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:36.187
This is my verse now, Samuel!

864
01:16:48.106 --> 01:16:50.856
(birds chirping)

865
01:17:12.077 --> 01:17:13.286
Morning, Dean!

866
01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:15.431
(energetic music)

867
01:17:15.433 --> 01:17:16.744
Don't know where you are,

868
01:17:16.746 --> 01:17:19.002
but I know you can hear this.

869
01:17:19.004 --> 01:17:21.066
Gotta say, Dean,

870
01:17:21.068 --> 01:17:24.927
I'm impressed by what you did yesterday.

871
01:17:24.929 --> 01:17:26.227
Knew this hunt was gonna be different,

872
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:30.300
but I never could've imagined
it was gonna be this exciting.


873
01:17:30.302 --> 01:17:33.228
In fact, thought I'd bring someone along

874
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:35.583
to make it even better.

875
01:17:35.585 --> 01:17:38.002
Dean, who the hell is this?

876
01:17:39.724 --> 01:17:42.055
You don't make a deal
with the devil, Dean,


877
01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:45.924
and not expect him to collect what's due.

878
01:17:45.926 --> 01:17:46.759
Say hello.

879
01:17:48.162 --> 01:17:50.912
Dean, they've got me and Reese.

880
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:54.143
I think you get the picture.

881
01:17:54.145 --> 01:17:57.501
Imma make this real easy on you, Dean.

882
01:17:57.503 --> 01:17:59.086
You got 10 seconds.

883
01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:01.653
Dean.

884
01:18:02.757 --> 01:18:03.590
One,

885
01:18:05.823 --> 01:18:06.656
two,

886
01:18:08.724 --> 01:18:09.557
three,

887
01:18:13.528 --> 01:18:14.361
four,

888
01:18:18.312 --> 01:18:19.145
five,

889
01:18:22.461 --> 01:18:23.294
six,

890
01:18:26.732 --> 01:18:27.565
seven,

891
01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:31.877
eight,

892
01:18:37.007 --> 01:18:37.840
nine,

893
01:18:40.392 --> 01:18:43.590
10 (Kate whimpers).

894
01:18:43.592 --> 01:18:46.175
(loud gunshot)

895
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:52.223
No!

896
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:55.588
Copy that, (mumbles).

897
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:58.257
(intense music)

898
01:19:01.431 --> 01:19:04.098
(rapid gunfire)

899
01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:29.257
(heavy breathing)

900
01:19:29.259 --> 01:19:32.092
That's right, she's still alive.

901
01:19:34.121 --> 01:19:35.285
She'll stay that way,

902
01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:37.704
as long as I get what I want.

903
01:19:43.325 --> 01:19:46.661
(ominous music)

904
01:19:46.663 --> 01:19:48.865
Doing good, Dean.

905
01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:52.332
Further than I ever thought you'd make it.

906
01:19:52.334 --> 01:19:54.452
Where's my family?

907
01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:58.062
Like I said before, they're safe.

908
01:19:58.064 --> 01:20:02.695
Whether or not they stay that
way is entirely up to you.


909
01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:05.840
You have something I want,
something you stole from me.


910
01:20:05.842 --> 01:20:06.842
Where is it?

911
01:20:08.341 --> 01:20:11.998
My family first (Sam chuckles).

912
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.392
You think you're in a
position to be making demands?


913
01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:18.261
Okay, see what your wife
has to say about this...


914
01:20:18.263 --> 01:20:19.846
No wait, no wait.

915
01:20:20.986 --> 01:20:25.006
Please, I'll show you, just
don't hurt her, please.


916
01:20:25.008 --> 01:20:25.841
Where?

917
01:20:26.725 --> 01:20:29.382
It's in the mountains, 
I'll show you.

918
01:20:29.384 --> 01:20:31.110
So we have an agreement then?

919
01:20:31.112 --> 01:20:32.510
Yes!

920
01:20:32.512 --> 01:20:33.989
Swear to it, Dean.

921
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:36.146
Yes, I swear on my life.

922
01:20:36.148 --> 01:20:39.731
I'll show you, just
please don't hurt them.


923
01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:43.994
That wasn't so hard after all, was it?

924
01:20:50.034 --> 01:20:51.367
Funny, isn't it?

925
01:20:52.343 --> 01:20:56.501
Only thing you love the most
ends up hurting in the end.


926
01:20:56.503 --> 01:20:59.030
I'll take you to the DVDs,

927
01:20:59.032 --> 01:21:00.563
you'll let 'em go, right?

928
01:21:00.565 --> 01:21:01.959
Right.

929
01:21:01.961 --> 01:21:03.600
And that's it.

930
01:21:03.602 --> 01:21:04.602
That's it?

931
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:06.582
Don't your remember, Dean?

932
01:21:06.584 --> 01:21:08.833
We had a contract.

933
01:21:08.835 --> 01:21:12.168
I have two, well, a
day and a half left.

934
01:21:13.293 --> 01:21:15.425
This has gone too far.

935
01:21:15.427 --> 01:21:17.935
There is no too far.

936
01:21:17.937 --> 01:21:20.036
Shoulda paid attention, Dean.

937
01:21:20.038 --> 01:21:23.064
There are no rules in the hunt.

938
01:21:23.066 --> 01:21:24.336
You got me.

939
01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:26.400
I'm dead already!

940
01:21:26.402 --> 01:21:27.569
True enough.

941
01:21:28.941 --> 01:21:32.103
I guess I'll just
have to take my time.

942
01:21:32.105 --> 01:21:36.211
(loud clicks)
(loud hissing)


943
01:21:36.213 --> 01:21:37.844
Admit it, Dean,

944
01:21:37.846 --> 01:21:40.846
you've been going there for a while.

945
01:21:41.687 --> 01:21:44.842
Expect you to make it this long.

946
01:21:44.844 --> 01:21:46.973
(Dean breathes heavily)

947
01:21:46.975 --> 01:21:49.234
See, I'm a man that
like to play with fire.


948
01:21:49.236 --> 01:21:51.819
(loud hissing)

949
01:21:53.796 --> 01:21:54.627
But ultimately...

950
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:55.460
No, please.

951
01:21:55.462 --> 01:21:56.840
Just like having control.

952
01:21:56.842 --> 01:21:59.228
No, no (breathes heavily).

953
01:21:59.230 --> 01:22:02.313
No, no, no (groans)!

954
01:22:04.871 --> 01:22:07.454
(Dean screams)

955
01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:13.292
(birds chirping)

956
01:22:25.943 --> 01:22:28.276
About that time, isn't it?

957
01:22:30.935 --> 01:22:34.001
(loud beeps)

958
01:22:34.003 --> 01:22:36.920
Wouldn't want you to run off again.

959
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.810
(dramatic music)

960
01:23:28.974 --> 01:23:31.807
(heavy breathing)

961
01:23:34.975 --> 01:23:36.225
Well, let's go.

962
01:23:38.169 --> 01:23:39.002
I can't.

963
01:23:40.634 --> 01:23:42.301
Fine, where is it?

964
01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:47.987
Up there on the ridge.

965
01:23:48.969 --> 01:23:52.552
All right, you stay
here, you're with me.


966
01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:19.011
Check it out.

967
01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:25.074
(heavy breathing)

968
01:24:48.553 --> 01:24:51.220
(loud gunshots)

969
01:24:56.462 --> 01:24:58.962
(man screams)

970
01:25:03.894 --> 01:25:07.061
(telephone keys beep)

971
01:26:05.715 --> 01:26:08.215
(loud groans)

972
01:26:32.308 --> 01:26:36.475
(energetic electronic music)
(loud gunshots)


973
01:26:58.781 --> 01:27:01.394
You can't hide from me now, Dean.

974
01:27:01.396 --> 01:27:03.479
Find you wherever you go.

975
01:27:46.213 --> 01:27:48.796
(loud gunshot)

976
01:27:54.199 --> 01:27:56.782
(loud gunshot)

977
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:04.292
(loud gunshot)

978
01:28:06.774 --> 01:28:09.024
(grunting)

979
01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:19.543
You can't run forever, Dean!

980
01:28:23.078 --> 01:28:26.245
(telephone keys beep)

981
01:28:31.732 --> 01:28:34.482
(dramatic music)

982
01:28:37.527 --> 01:28:40.360
(heavy breathing)

983
01:29:19.957 --> 01:29:24.124
(punches thud against flesh)
(grunting)


984
01:30:01.252 --> 01:30:03.669
(loud beeps)

985
01:30:05.353 --> 01:30:06.686
End of the line!

986
01:30:07.936 --> 01:30:11.029
(dramatic music)

987
01:30:11.031 --> 01:30:13.614
Been fun, time to wrap this up.

988
01:30:15.859 --> 01:30:18.534
Got a date with
your wife and son later.

989
01:30:18.536 --> 01:30:21.203
(loud gunshots)

990
01:30:26.619 --> 01:30:30.786
(punches thud against flesh)
(grunting)


991
01:30:51.209 --> 01:30:55.376
(loud crunch)
(screaming)


992
01:31:03.854 --> 01:31:05.504
(repeated beeps)

993
01:31:05.506 --> 01:31:06.506
It's offset.

994
01:31:10.258 --> 01:31:11.508
The jig's over.

995
01:31:16.793 --> 01:31:17.626
You win!

996
01:31:26.965 --> 01:31:28.490
(screaming)

997
01:31:28.492 --> 01:31:30.659
(choking)

998
01:31:49.739 --> 01:31:52.572
(heavy breathing)

999
01:32:06.191 --> 01:32:08.858
(loud chirping)

1000
01:32:53.863 --> 01:32:56.196
Will master be joining us?

1001
01:33:21.747 --> 01:33:23.247
My wife and son.

1002
01:33:24.276 --> 01:33:25.943
Back at the house.

1003
01:33:41.909 --> 01:33:44.576
(fire crackles)

1004
01:33:55.731 --> 01:33:57.700
Would you like to count it?

1005
01:33:57.702 --> 01:33:58.853
Yes, I do.

1006
01:33:58.855 --> 01:34:00.022
As you wish.

1007
01:34:01.871 --> 01:34:04.538
Bring some over your drinking.

1008
01:34:18.447 --> 01:34:20.947
Can I get you anything else?

1009
01:34:21.938 --> 01:34:24.021
That'll be it, for now.

1010
01:34:30.001 --> 01:34:32.610
What are they doing with the mansion?

1011
01:34:32.612 --> 01:34:33.777
They're selling it,

1012
01:34:33.779 --> 01:34:36.946
it's in accordance with master's will.

1013
01:34:38.999 --> 01:34:40.522
For how much?

1014
01:34:40.524 --> 01:34:41.774
I'm not sure.

1015
01:34:43.399 --> 01:34:45.316
You go find that out.

1016
01:34:49.524 --> 01:34:51.274
And my wife and kids.

1017
01:35:13.689 --> 01:35:16.649
- (peaceful music)
- Dean, if you're reading this


1018
01:35:16.651 --> 01:35:19.651
that means you've survived the hunt.

1019
01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:23.288
I'm glad you're still alive.

1020
01:35:23.290 --> 01:35:27.215
Money is important, Dean,
but it can't buy everything.


1021
01:35:27.217 --> 01:35:30.642
It won't bring my son back to me,

1022
01:35:30.644 --> 01:35:34.811
or change the fact that
he died, alone and scared.


1023
01:35:36.429 --> 01:35:40.112
And it will never
let me trust you again.

1024
01:35:40.114 --> 01:35:42.591
You can tell yourself
you did it for us,

1025
01:35:42.593 --> 01:35:44.010
but that's a lie.

1026
01:35:45.004 --> 01:35:48.682
We both know you did it for yourself.

1027
01:35:48.684 --> 01:35:51.767
Our family is gone, 
Dean, you sold us

1028
01:35:53.992 --> 01:35:55.825
for a million dollars.

1029
01:35:57.604 --> 01:35:59.521
I hope it was worth it.

1030
01:36:57.912 --> 01:37:00.662
(dramatic music)

1031
01:37:00.664 --> 01:37:05.664
