2
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.840
Hello.

3
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.520
You didn't expect to ever
see me in the cinema, did you?


4
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.796
Films tell us incredible stories.

5
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120
Stories full of crazy twists and turns

6
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.000
and adventure.

7
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.196
But in one thing, they're all the same.

8
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.396
Somewhere deep down, you simply know

9
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.400
that they were written
by a screenwriter sitting on a sofa.


10
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.760
I guess that's why I'm not a filmmaker.

11
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.160
I've always sort of preferred
that ordinary boring thing called...


12
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.396
...reality.

13
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.720
Because all those films
end once the credits are over.


14
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.480
But when you get out of here today,

15
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.276
everything will be at the very beginning.

16
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.520
They haven't locked us up yet.

17
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.720
Enjoy our first

18
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.200
feature film.

19
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.400
Ah!

20
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.836
Everything is allowed in here.

21
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.996
In films, you can get away with
dealing drugs and chasing cops.


22
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.720
You can even execute people
and nobody cares.


23
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.240
Relax!

24
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.636
Everything's fine.

25
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.880
They were just extras.

26
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.476
Fuck, can I be dubbed by someone else?

27
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.320
This is terrible.

28
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.600
Excuse me.

29
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.200
Ladies,

30
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.280
you look good.

31
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.840
Well,

32
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.000
this is much better.

33
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.796
THEY'RE NOT ACTING

34
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.556
<i>This is a party
I attended a few years ago.</i>


35
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.560
<i>And it changed my life
for many years to come.</i>


36
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.436
<i>Have you ever thought about
what you would do</i>


37
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.480
<i>if you woke up one morning
and found yourselves in a movie?</i>


38
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.276
<i>And if you could take something
from it back to reality?</i>


39
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.320
<i>I'd probably rob a bank
or something like that.</i>


40
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.316
We need at least two million crowns
to get this thing going.


41
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.080
Are you fucking kidding me?
You're both nuts!


42
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.316
You think being able to crash

43
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.160
a stupid cooking show

44
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.196
will help you get inside a casino?

45
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.800
But we'll do it differently, Ivo.

46
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.476
We'll make them play
according to our rules.


47
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.760
Yeah, you'll have your own rules.

48
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.636
But in prison, mate.

49
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.040
Listen, you're probably right.
Maybe we've had too much...


50
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.436
Appetite.

51
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.720
Yeah, unnecessarily high expectations.

52
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.320
I guess it's all bullshit.

53
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.920
I just wonder, you smartarses,

54
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.000
which casino it was supposed to be.

55
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.280
You want to fix a fucking football match?!

56
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.236
Am I wearing pointy pink loafers?
Or a Borussia Dortmund hat?


57
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.640
- No, you're not.
- I'm not! I'm dressed normally.


58
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.480
Elegantly.

59
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.156
Are you looking at my chain?

60
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.560
No, just at how your neck
got so thin on that diet.


61
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.960
Yeah.

62
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.000
It's two rings shorter already.
And my target is four, mate.


63
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.796
But the point is that
this is a tasteful chain.


64
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.036
Do you understand? 
I don't want to have

65
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.240
anything to do with those football pricks.

66
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.840
You wanted two mill?

67
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.280
- That'd be great.
- You get half a mill.


68
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.116
Here you are.

69
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.916
Watermelon smoothie
gives me the shits anyway.


70
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.760
Your girl id a model, right?

71
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.680
<i>Not many people know it, but
it's not just a betting agency anymore.</i>


72
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.396
They have an online roulette,
online black jack... Is that right, Steve?


73
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.876
Yeah, they're the biggest
online casino in Czechia.


74
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.236
- Is that Vendy?
- Hmm.


75
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.956
- That's her car?
- She gives me lifts since


76
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.716
I lost my papers.
And now it's going to be tailor-made.


77
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.636
Yeah. We just need money for the campaign.

78
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.156
- Let them eat the bait.
- You said you liked roulette and stuff,


79
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.516
didn't you?

80
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.560
Does she know we'll need her car?

81
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.676
- No.
- You're nuts, but this is pretty good.


82
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.120
- I want twenty percent.
- Ten.


83
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.440
Plus the watermelon.

84
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.480
I got you a watermelon.

85
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.680
How kind of you.

86
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.720
It's kind of you to give me lifts.

87
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.636
You're the prettiest driver I have.

88
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.840
I'm your only driver!

89
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.240
Let's go.

90
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.920
Get the crew ready. 
I'll call you.

91
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.200
Wow!

92
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.316
You're such a sweetheart.

93
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.520
- You know how much I love stuffed animals.
- I do.


94
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.676
- Honey?
- Yeah?


95
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.676
Would you mind being
without your car for a while?


96
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760
Why?

97
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.516
We need to film something.

98
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.120
- Okay.
- Yeah?


99
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.080
We're ready.

100
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.040
Alright, let's do it!

101
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.360
Camera! Sound!

102
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.036
"I Buried a Car," take one.

103
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.320
Clapperboard!

104
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.160
And action!

105
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.160
Hello. I want to tell you something
that nobody knows about.


106
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.876
A few months ago,
I lost my driving licence.


107
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.760
I'm sure a lot
of you know this car.

108
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.716
It's my Range Rover Evoque.

109
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.995
It's been part of my life
for some time and I really like it.


110
00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:39.440
But I don't want it to be idle.
So I thought of something.


111
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.076
Thanks to all those of you who follow me,
I was able to buy it some years ago.


112
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.036
So now I'm gonna give
it to one of you.

113
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.000
I put this car in a shipping container.

114
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.800
And buried it a month ago
somewhere in the Czech Republic.


115
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.120
Including the keys and the MOT
certificate. If you find it, it's yours.


116
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.036
Just send me a single SMS
with your email to this number.


117
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.276
That's your ticket to enter the game.
You have a fortnight.


118
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.996
Then the registration process ends.

119
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.636
And there's one more thing
you might be interested in.


120
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.876
Besides the keys and the MOT,

121
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.880
there's also one million crowns
in the boot of the car.


122
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.640
Game on.

123
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.160
Stop! Good! We'll take it.

124
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.516
Alright, gang,
it's got to be within driving distance,


125
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.836
but away from civilization.

126
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.516
No utility lines or groundwater.

127
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600
Alpha Team will take this area,
Beta Team the other one.


128
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.160
I want each of you to have
your eyes wide open. Is that clear?


129
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.280
- I'm Alpha Team.
- You're not.


130
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.516
Steve is Alpha and he'll head west.
Háša and I will head north.


131
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.036
<i>Finding a suitable place for
burying a shipping container undetected</i>


132
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.356
<i>is certainly not an easy task.</i>

133
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.316
<i>We'd covered hundreds of miles
before we found</i>


134
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.876
<i>this abandoned lot by the woods.</i>

135
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.436
<i>It has everything that we need.</i>

136
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.796
<i>There's only one small drawback, though.</i>

137
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.796
<i>The owner and his wife live right here.</i>

138
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.440
He's in his seventies
and his name is Lajner.


139
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.000
Damn it. A curious old man.

140
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.836
He mustn't know anything about it.

141
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.440
- What shall we do?
- Let's kill him.


142
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.920
And bury him next to the container.

143
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.276
Are you serious, mate?

144
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.596
So what do you want to do?
It's gonna be a huge crater.


145
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.236
We need a lot of people, heavy machinery.

146
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.956
Only the lights will be like
on a film set.


147
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.040
- A film set you say?
- That's what I said.


148
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.436
Okay.

149
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.116
<i>Our lawyers prepared
a cunning lease agreement.</i>


150
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.276
<i>We rented the site to shoot
a historical war film.</i>


151
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.516
THE SECRET TRENCH

152
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.236
<i>There's a scene for which
it's necessary to dig</i>


153
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.756
<i>a small trench the soldiers
are going to shoot from.</i>


154
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.240
And I'll be the director.

155
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.840
Let's go.

156
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.036
Hello, my name's Göring, nice to meet you.

157
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.076
- Göring, good evening.
- Lajner.


158
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.280
The keys are...

159
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.836
Alright listen,

160
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.716
- we have all the contract details in here.
- Yeah.


161
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.236
It's a short,15-minute movie.

162
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.476
We need to dig that trench.

163
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.916
And how big is the hole gonna be?

164
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.356
That hole's gonna be approximately
three metres by six


165
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.356
and maybe two and a half metres deep.

166
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.756
- Two and a half?
- Two, two and a half, we'll see.


167
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.836
Why so deep?

168
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.356
We're putting in a capsule, this kind of...

169
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.396
- Bunker, huh?
- Yeah.


170
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.716
Which will be removed later.

171
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.720
It'll be taken out, then buried.
We're shooting it on the last day.


172
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.800
- Listen, is that really your hair?
- Yeah.


173
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.316
- What's wrong with it?
- May I?


174
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.636
It's a bit long right now, yeah...

175
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.640
- Well, that's the way we artists are.
- Nothing wrong with that.


176
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.120
"Listen, is that really your hair?"

177
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.640
Shit, I was so scared, mate!

178
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.836
- The way you held onto it!
- "Go ahead, feel it."


179
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.036
Go, buddy, go.

180
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.436
<i>Háša went to the other meetings
without me just to be on the safe side.</i>


181
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.276
Well, it is kind of weird...

182
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.436
- They're smart.
- He wears a wig, doesn't he?


183
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.396
I've known him for five years,
but I'm not sure.


184
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.156
They're artists, they're different.

185
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.876
- A bit balmy.
<i>- Yes, that's it.</i>


186
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.920
<i>Zdeněk Troška is kind of nuts as well,
but look at the movies he makes.</i>


187
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.520
All the things we have to do
so that he doesn't find out


188
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.476
what we're actually doing...

189
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.396
Here's our arsenal. Is it loaded?

190
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.680
Look at the machine guns.

191
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.756
They're all Rio. 
Rio from Germany.

192
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.756
<i>And to make all this seem plausible,</i>

193
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.636
<i>we also had some first-class actors hired.</i>

194
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.036
<i>They were willing to help
a young promising student</i>


195
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.796
<i>with his graduation film.</i>

196
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.996
It's quite simply a student film.

197
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.356
It takes place during the war,
we're shooting on different places...


198
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.436
Don't go into too much detail,
don't let them expose us.


199
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.556
<i>So the acclaimed actors
really arrived here today.</i>


200
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.516
<i>They don't have a clue as to
what's actually going on.</i>


201
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.516
- If you need something, let me know.
- Yeah.


202
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.716
There's some catering here.
Take whatever you want.


203
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.240
- Excellent.
- And these are our makeup artists.


204
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.396
<i>Do you find this crazy enough?</i>

205
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.240
<i>Well, in a short while
they'll be wearing Nazi uniforms.</i>


206
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.600

212
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.796
<i>It is certainly possible</i>

213
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.596
<i>that curious Mr. Lajner
might want to come and have a look.</i>


214
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.880
<i>And to make sure he doesn't
catch us unaware,</i>


215
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.796
<i>he was cast as well.</i>

GARDENER OF THE YEAR 3
-TIME FINALIST

217
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.596
<i>It is set in the middle of a battlefield
when the war is almost over.</i>


218
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.116
Hitler is here and he's just
got word that...


219
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.876
- It's all wrong.
- Exactly.


220
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.756
The marshal who was supposed
come to their rescue isn't coming,


221
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.116
and Hitler suddenly realizes
he's just lost the war.


222
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.236
- I understand.
- Yeah?


223
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.800
Great, thank you very much.

224
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.316
<i>We'll keep shooting until
he starts feeling tired.</i>


225
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.116
And then we send him home

226
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.160
saying that it was the last take
and that he can go to sleep.


227
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.756
That'll be our moment.

228
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.440
Let's do it! Mr. 
Lajner in position!

229
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.760
Camera!

230
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.400
One A, take one.

231
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.836
- Sound!
- We're rolling, quiet!


232
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.520
And action!

233
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.000
Everything's gone completely to shit!

234
00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.956
And action!

235
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.396
Everything's gone completely to shit!

236
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.476
- And action!
- Everything's gone completely to shit!


237
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.756
Fuck! Come on...

238
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.476
This is the last bit
and then the A-list is done.


239
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.960
Everything's gone completely to shit!

240
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.120
You're out of line now, mate.

241
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.476
- You're staying, you're staying...
- Still, huh?


242
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.480
That's right.

243
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.000
You get hit, you run, you fall

244
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.920
and you're dead.

245
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.760
- Camera!
- We're rolling.


246
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.400
And action!

247
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.960
You should fall a bit faster, Mr. Lajner.
Action!


248
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.760
No good. One more time! Action!

249
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.280
Again. Action!

250
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.516
Mr. Lajner, roll over! Stop! Stop!

251
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.280
It can be better still, fall over. Action!

252
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.356
It's not perfect yet, you can do better!

253
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.516
I'll get it out of you, Mr. Lajner,
you'll be a great Nazi!


254
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.400
One more time. Action!

255
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.560
Stop! Stop!

256
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.320
Great. Okay, thanks a lot!

257
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.120
Hitler's lying...

258
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.756
Thank you. Láďa can go home now.
Thank you!


259
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.316
Thank you, thank you very much.

260
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.240
- You're welcome.
- It was great, thank you.


261
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.676
It's taking a lot of time,
but otherwise it's great.


262
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.236
It is long, I know.
We'll be here till morning.


263
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.000
- I left that there...
- Okay, thank you.


264
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.560
Now we can finally
start doing what we're here for.


265
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.800
So while Grandpa's sleeping nearby,

266
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.400
we've just dug this mass grave.

267
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.596
If he comes back,
I don't know what we'll do.


268
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.196
This isn't three by six, mate.

269
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.836
We had to make it bigger,
the bunker's really huge.


270
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.480
We'll just say it fell through.

271
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.956
Come on, boys.

272
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.399
We're a bit behind schedule.

273
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.359
Let's fucking bury it!
Dawn's almost breaking.


274
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.160
Oh, Mr. Kazma himself.

275
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.316
- What's that?
- Money.


276
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.996
- Not enough.
- Listen...


277
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.640
I don't give a shit
if it flew out of the taxi


278
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.916
or if you gave it to
that fucking foundation of yours.


279
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.396
- There's one million in it.
- So there're nine missing.


280
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.960
Are you fucking kidding me?

281
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.800
Lest you forget.

282
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.476
Default interest.

283
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.480
You've just bought a bit of time.
So it's still ten.


284
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.840
<i>I'll give you a secret recipe

285
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.956
<i>It should look trustworthy.</i>

286
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.236
<i>You need a website,</i>

287
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.876
<i>some commercial entities</i>

288
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.956
<i>and strong media partners.</i>

289
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:19.996
GAME ON

290
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.316
Is it really buried somewhere or is it
yet another trick of yours?


291
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.556
<i>Add a national campaign to the mix</i>

292
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.476
<i>so that all the fish
in the area know about it.</i>


293
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.636
Check out his Instagram,
because he's just buried the car.


294
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.076
Kazma's changed our plans,
we're going to look for his car.


295
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.756
I took two weeks off at work.

296
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.796
You're crazy.

297
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.956
There's a Range Rover
buried somewhere in this country.


298
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.156
- Where's the car?
- One million!


299
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.440
Burying a car is...

300
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.996
The fact that he buried his car
with one million in the boot


301
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.556
is well-known all over the country.

302
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.316
<i>And when tongues start
wagging in the pond,</i>

<i>it always attracts even bigger fish.</i>

304
00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.276
Now I'm getting really interested.

305
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.556
<i>You're listening to Europe 2.</i>

306
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.316
<i>As you probably know,
Kazma's buried his Range Rover.</i>


307
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.396
<i>Wrap the whole thing up
in legally-processed conditions</i>


308

311
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.120
Bingo.

312
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.196
- What?
- Here we go!


313
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.320
- Is it on offer?
- It is on offer!


314
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.880
It is on offer!

315
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.480
- Who said that?!
- You said it!


316
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.440
- Who said that?!
- You said it!


317
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.436
Kamča?

318
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.880
<i>An old magic trick
that makes others believe</i>


319
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.676
<i>that the card they chose
was their own choice.</i>


320
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.000
Okay. What have we got here?

321
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.156
"The region where the car will be found."
Great. We need that.


322
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.396
We know where it is. So let's bet
on Central Bohemia and that's it.


323
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.756
Look,
you can even bet on who's gonna find it.


324
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.276
- Who's there?
- Leoš Mareš, Řepka, Rittig...


325
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.240
Mate! They've got a good sense of humour.

326
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.640
Who's the biggest outsider?

327
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.880
Lubor Dědič.

328
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.476
Who the hell is Lubor Dědič?

329
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.360
<i>A celebrity in the world of bookies.</i>

330
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.000
<i>He's been around for decades
taking millions from Czech bookies.</i>


331
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.760
<i>His picture is on the wall
of every fucking betting shop.</i>


332
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.280
Something like
Lance Armstrong of Czech betting.


333
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.240
No one has ever caught him.
So he probably still has both balls.


334
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.640
So let's recap, shall we?

335
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.676
You've fooled the whole
country with some retarded game


336
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.356
in which you can
win a stupid fucking car!

337
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.440
Zillions of people got involved

338
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.720
and now you're gonna
let some arsehole win.


339
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.360
In doing so, you'll rob
the biggest betting agency of a few mill.


340
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.360
And they're not gonna
lock you up, am I right?


341
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.316
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


342
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.116
And now you need the same nutters
like the pair of you.


343
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.156
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


344
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.520
Anyone springs to mind?

345
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.196
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


346
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.280
Okay. Who's gonna get us in?

347
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.440
Laco.

348
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.240
The best lockpicker I know.

349
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.436
Mate, he looks like someone
who can barely pick a bike lock


350
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.036
with a fucking steel pipe!

351
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.480
Is he a gypsy?

352
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.036
- He's a white gypsy.
- What?


353
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.236
You're very punctual. 
Busy, are you?

354
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.276
You know I work only
first Wednesdays of the month.


355
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.076
- We've got a small job for you.
- A small job?


356
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.520
He's trying to be a gypsy, you know?
Besides...


357
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.440
We need one person of colour
in the film anyway.


358
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.516
Okay. So the next one is...

359
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.916
Hello, Ruslan.
Still pretending your place is packed?


360
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.960
Kazmitch! Good to see you, buddy.

361
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.396
Come and see me when you're done here.

362
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.196
- Well, shall we go?
- What's up?


363
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.156
- Have these girls even got an ID?
- Since when do you care about their age?


364
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.276
I thought you were happy. With Vendy.

365
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.796
- Do you check their IDs or not?
- And what about IT?


366
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.600
I know of only one
ace that can do it.

367
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.840
Hello. Can we come in?

368
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.800
Alright.

369
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.640
Listen, if you need anything,
I'll give you a hand.


370
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.280
Take it easy, Linuks. Sit down.

371
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.716
- And shut up.
- I've already forgiven you


372
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.676
for crashing our server when we were
about to launch the new merch.


373
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.280
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- I'm not here to beat you up.


374
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.720
- But it cost me a fortune back then.
- I'll pay you back.


375
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.480
Would you like something to drink?

376
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.636
I'd like some cocoa, please.

377
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.960
Hmm.

378
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.716
I've got certain plans.

379
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.560
And we need someone who could...

380
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.760
...make us some cocoa.

381
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.440
Hello.

382
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.876
I've got a pretty interesting venture
for you, but it's a bit risky.


383
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.036
If you think
you're gonna win a Range Rover,


384
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.756
finish your ciggie
and get back on the train.


385
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.676
But if you think
life's too predictable and boring,


386
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.840
follow me.

387
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.316
Gentlemen, this is the biggest
online casino in Czechia.


388
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.636
So that's what it's all about.

389
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.596
An online Monte Carlo slap bang
in the middle of our fucking republic.


390
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.640
I'm sure a lot of you
have lost some money there already.


391
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.236
So I suppose no one will mind

392
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.636
if we get a few pennies back.

393
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.516
I want to take ten mill from them.
Plus a fair share for each of you.


394
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.196
Most of the work is already done.

395
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.916
We're going to bet the SMS money
on the location where the car


396
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.716
will be found and thus earn a multiple.

397
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.160
Yeah, it sounds easy.
But we have to be smart


398
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.560
and always stay a
few steps ahead of them.

399
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.240
Frank.

400
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.280
- Frank's our ace up our sleeve.
- Hello.


401
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.156
They have security systems
that keep an eye on


402
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.556
suspicious moves and big bets.
And there's also a limit.


403
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.796
So betting a huge amount on one location

404
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.560
without anyone noticing
is virtually impossible.


405
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.720
We need to set up several accounts.
And they all have to be verified.


406
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.640
- So?
- So we're gonna need IDs.


407
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.080
I've lost weight, you see?

408
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.680
We need

409
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.160
a lot of IDs.

410
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.356
Give it here.

411
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.756
<i>An old saying goes that collective crimes</i>

412
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.036
<i>are nobody's responsibility.</i>

413
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.076
<i>We need at least 400 accounts
for the amount we want to win,</i>


414
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.560
<i>all of them verified via e-mail
and mobile phone numbers.</i>


415
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.160
<i>It's gonna look completely real
and trustworthy.</i>


416
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.636
But when a lot of people bet
on one horse only,


417
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.916
the bookies immediately see
a shining Christmas tree.


418
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.996
That's why we have to
drown some of the money


419
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.076
and bet on locations that won't win.

420
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.876
But the rest will go to our site
in smaller amounts.


421
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.316
So small that those warning lights
of theirs won't even start flashing.


422
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.316
Both online via VPN
and physically at the counters.


423
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.076
One person a thousand in Aš,
another five hundred in Ostrava.


424
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.396
We've got a team of people
divided into different groups.


425
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.676
Dark-haired, fair-haired, skinny, fat,
men, women.


426
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.476
And like this, quietly and unobtrusively,
we're going to bet


427
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.800
the whole sum on the right card
within the next fortnight.


428
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.276
The one that's up our sleeve.

429
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.076
Amongst tens of thousands of bettors,

430
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.836
a few hundred of our bets
can never be traced back.


431
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.756
They won't find out who was who,
they won't be able to prove anything.


432
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.360
- And a crime that can't be proven...
- Simply doesn't exist.


433
00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.476
Voilà.

434
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.196
And how come you
know so much about it?

435
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.000
I forgot to tell you
about Frank's new job.


436
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.476
<i>We had him find a
job there six months ago</i>

437
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.156
<i>to keep an eye
on the bookies for us.</i>

438
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.316
- Hello. I'm here for the interview.
- Great, welcome to Fortuna.


439
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.316
Like I said, most
of the work is done.

440
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.196
- No one suspects anything.
- Tell them about the server room.


441
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.956
Alright, it's an online archive
of their entire empire.


442
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.276
All the bets, odds
and other data are stored in it.


443
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.236
They keep them there for several decades,
as the law demands.


444
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.636
So if we want to see the spread
of the bets on individual locations,


445
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.400
we need to tap in. Linuks?

446
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.236
- No problem.
- Well, there's one, actually.


447
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.716
It is an external company
that provides them with the servers.


448
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.280
I can find out where it is,
but I can't get in there with my card.


449
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.800
Laco will help us with that.

450
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.480
As soon as he removes
the metal paperweight from his trousers.


451
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.960
Put it back, for fuck's sake!

452
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.680
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.360
Just practising.

454
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.480
Alright, any questions?

455
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.920
Nobody? Let's do it.

456
00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.956
Hey!

457
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.036
Can't you put some decent music on?
It's action time, damn it!


458
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.120
Well, that's better.

459
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.996
The coast is clear. And action!

460
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.480
- Stop, wait!
- What is it?


461
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.720
- That's what I say, mate.
- Well, you do always say that, but...


462
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.316
Yeah, that's what I say.
I always start the action.


463
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.596
Okay. You're the boss,
I'm just the manager.


464
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.400
- I'm the boss, you're the manager.
- Okay, so say it.


465
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.120
The coast is clear. And action!

466
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.760
What a prick.

467
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.800
What the fuck is Linuks carrying?

468
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.080
We said no guns!

469
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.440
I only took a knife, mate!

470
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.200
Shut up, Laco.

471
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.076
- Shit!
- Shit!


472
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.476
What's going on, you fucking turds?!

473
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.960
- Shit!
- What're you doing out there, boys?


474
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.596
I can see you. 
I'll call the police.

475
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.996
Fuck! You got another one in there, mate?

476
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.320
No, I haven't.

477
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.756
- We are...
- What?


478
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.640
- Chimney sweepers.
- Oh, I see.


479
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.600
Okay. Come on, Maxie.

480
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.560
Chimney sweepers are the best excuse ever.
But I really don't know why.


481
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.880
Me neither.

482
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.196
The anchor didn't take hold.

483
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.240
What anchor, you idiots?!
There's a fire escape, mate!


484
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.080
Keep climbing!

485
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.920
Oh, shit, I think I'm claustrophobic.

486
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.400
Shut up and move on.

487
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.556
<i>You're doing fine. 
Keep going.</i>

488
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.516
It should be the
first door on the left.

489
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.360
According to this map,
we should be right here.


490
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.716
Do you have to smoke even in this duct
for fuck's sake?


491
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.360
I'm fucking nervous! 
Come on, mate!

492
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.480
- Security.
- There's a security guard.


493
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.640
<i>There's a security guard, be careful.</i>

494
00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.080
SERVER ROOM

495
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.636
Fuck! When were you born?

496
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.676
What're you talking about?!
Open it before someone comes in.


497
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.116
- Relax! Don't stress me out!
- Come on!


498
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.440
I've never seen this before.

499
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.200
Oh, shit.

500
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.760
Come on.

501
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.396
He really broke it
with a fucking steel pipe!


502
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.716
Mate! You really broke it
with a fucking steel pipe!


503
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.076
We could have done this remotely,
couldn't we?


504
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.156
Nobody's gonna buy that, mate.

505
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.280
But this is the latest version.

506
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.320
- Cool.
- It's done.


507
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.836
- Director, isn't that a bit too much?
- I like it. Let's move on.


508
00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.916
Okay, an action scene.

509
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.276
Alright, I've never been in a film before.
I'm not judging.


510
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.880
Let's move on, then.

511
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.760
This is like MacGyver, mate.

512
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.200
Go in there. I'm going
to weld it back on.

513
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.836
- So?
- It's good.


514
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.160
- Are we ready?
- In a minute.


515
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.160
Done!

516
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.636
Where have you been?

517
00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.040
Sorry, I was really busy.

518
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.960
- I was waiting for you with dinner.
- I'll make it up to you.


519
00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:10.960
I'm cooking tomorrow, okay?

520
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.556
Wait. Since I'm dressed like a copper,
can we do it right now?


521
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.440
Okay, well...

522
00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.640
Here you are.

523
00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.320
- You're cheating.
- Just a bit.


524
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.076
- Hello.
- Hello.


525
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.719
Sorry to interrupt your meal,
but can we take a picture with you?


526
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.800
Sorry.

527
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.120
Alright, girls.

528
00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.595
- Good?
- Thank you.


529
00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.635
And that car thing, it's really great!

530
00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:57.236
We've sent an SMS as well
and now we're waiting for the clue.


531
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.636
Yeah? Thank you. Good luck.

532
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.760
- Thank you.
- Bye.


533
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.636
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.756
You should have told me
that you wanted to bury the car.


535
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.316
Everybody asks me about it.
Everybody wants to know where it is.


536
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.716
- Baby...
- But I don't know anything


537
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.996
about it at all.

538
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.996
It's a bit out of control right now.
But it's just a game.


539
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.040
Listen, somebody's gonna dig it up
in a few days and it'll all be over.


540
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.200
Everything will calm down, believe me.

541
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.196
I'm glad to hear that.

542
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.040
You might even start sleeping
at home again.


543
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.836
I told you I'd have to go and check
the car at nights.


544
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.800
They're after us, you see?

545
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.596
I know.

546
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.160
- You're James Bond.
- Hmm.


547
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.680
Excuse me. A small gift for the lady.

548
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.520
- Thank you.
- With pleasure.


549
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.556
You really didn't have to.

550
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.880
Well, I thought that

551
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.080
once in a while...

552
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.676
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

553
00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.560
The truth is that
you know how to surprise me.


554
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.000
I'm gonna use the bathroom, okay?

555
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.360
I told you I'd get the money,
for fuck's sake!


556
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.800
If you go anywhere near her again...

557
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.360
Do you really think

558
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.040
I'm going to wait forever?

559
00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.600
Look at this.

560
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.040
Hey, mate.

561
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.640
You start on the first field
using the knight's moves.


562
00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.440
In cycles, to the right and then down.

563
00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.600
Over and over again.

564
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.040
And that's the whole trick.

565
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.476
- I can't fucking do that, mate!
- Ruslan!


566
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.796
That's too hard!

567
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.520
- So, are we all set?
- Yes, boss.


568
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.516
All our bettors are
in the field and in position.


569
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.920
We have online access to
the betting spread. Everything's running.


570
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.956
- Frank?
- We're all clear.


571
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.116
- They don't know anything.
- We're waiting for you command.


572
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.920
Okay. Alright.

573
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.960
We're on in three, two,

574
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.440
one!

575
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.560
Let's send it in there!

576
00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.916
<i>Here we go.</i>

577
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.236
<i>Hundreds of our punters all over
the country are taking to the field.</i>


578
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.080
<i>One person one thousand in Aš,</i>

579
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.516
<i>another one five hundred in Ostrava.</i>

580
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.956
<i>Different sums in small amounts
on a daily basis</i>


581
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.516
<i>while hundreds of thousands of people
are eagerly waiting for the clue</i>


582
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.196
<i>before hitting the streets.</i>

583
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.156
Last 48 hours and there we go!

584
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.316
I'm waiting for the clue
and then I'm on it.


585
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.076
Once you start looking for the car,
you must be as horny and hard


586
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.160
as Robin Hood's dick
when he sees Maid Marian naked!


587
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.276
I want to find Kazma's car!

588
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.556
We have to dig it up!

589
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.316
- We want that car!
- Well, let's get started!


590
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.160
<i>Nothing can stop us now.
With the exception of a...</i>


591
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.640
<i>...worldwide...</i>

592
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.920
<i>...apocalypse or something of that sort.</i>

593
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.520
No, no, no, not now!

594
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.200
<i>Not now! Oh, my God!</i>

595
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.836
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

596
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.196
The government restraints
the free movement of people...


597
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.680
We have 368 deaths a day!

598
00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.316
It is necessary to reduce
interpersonal contact to a minimum.


599
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.320
Spreading coronavirus
is a criminal offence.


600
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.680
<i>And that was the moment</i>

601
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.000
<i>when the whole world stopped.</i>

602
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.996
Okay. No one is allowed to go outside
and all the districts are closed off.


603
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.160
And what does that mean for us?

604
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.396
Well, for you nothing, actually.

605
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.396
Nothing new, mate, you take it easy.

606
00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.316
The container is underground,
the bets have been partly placed,


607
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.356
there's a global pandemic out there

608
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.956
and in 48 hours hundreds

609
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.276
of thousands of people are supposed
to start looking for that fucking car!


610
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.116
- Steve.
- But I knew it! Didn't I tell you?


611
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.560
- Fuck, I told you!
- Steve, relax! Take it easy, mate.


612
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.440
Close your eyes.

613
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.316
Take a deep breath.

614
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.640
Yeah.

615
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.596
Think of a nice place
that you really like.


616
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.560
Sunshine, a tiny little stream...

617
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.760
Raspberries with whipped cream.

618
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.440
What can you smell?

619
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.960
- Pigi tea.
- What Pigi tea, mate?!


620
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.876
I don't give a shit, but we're really
asking for serious trouble now.


621
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.720
We shouldn't even be here in such numbers.

622
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.280
- How much have we got at stake?
- About 30 percent.


623
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.236
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.


624
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.240
We have to blow the whistle.

625
00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.076
Think a little! 
We can't do that now!

626
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.356
I can't go to prison,
my mom would kill me.


627
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.396
You get free food there, accommodation...
Who gives a fuck?


628
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.716
If we don't do anything stupid,
we should alright.


629
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.396
Look at me and listen to me for once.
This is getting fucking serious!


630
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.996
That's complete bullshit,
they're just playing you!


631
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.716
This is unnecessarily escalated.
There's nothing wrong with the nick.


632
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.400
What for, mate?

633
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.356
We're all gonna die in here, you see!

634
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.720
We're gonna die!

635
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.640
Relax!

636
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.880
We've come a long way
and it's cost us all quite a lot.


637
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.120
Let's take a vote.

638
00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.756
<i>It is said that life is
what happens to you</i>


639
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.560
<i>when you have other plans.</i>

640
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.040
<i>We were up to our ears in it.</i>

641
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.880
<i>Far beyond the point of no return.</i>

642
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.600
<i>And we all knew it.</i>

643
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.316
<i>But we also knew
we had to do something.</i>

644
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.520
<i>Because doing nothing
is always the worst choice.</i>


645
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.000
Okay,

646
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.000
I'll make the final decision.

647
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.160
Get some sleep
and I'll let you know tomorrow.


648
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.196
Hello. We've been working
for several long months


649
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.116
to set up a game
unparalleled in our country.


650
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.600
It was due to start
on the 12th of October.


651
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.956
But just before launching it,
a state of emergency had been declared.


652
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.476
No more than six people can get
together at one place at the moment.


653
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.120
But this game takes place out there.
In actual reality.


654
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.760
And it involves thousands
of people from all over the country.


655
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.316
So it wouldn't be wise
to organize this kind of hunt right now.


656
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.836
So we've decided to postpone it
until the situation is stable again.


657
00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.800
Stop! We're done.

658
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.320
We have to dig the car out, mate.

659
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.396
- Are you fucking nuts?
- Just look at it.


660
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.116
This state of emergency can last
for years.


661
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.036
It's not set up for that, you see?

662
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.880
And winter's coming, for fuck's sake.

663
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.160
It's gonna rot in there
with all that money.


664
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.600
How are you gonna do that?

665
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.756
- Is anyone there?
- Yes. Hello, Mr. Lajner.


666
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.156
- It's me, Göring.
- What do you need, boys?


667
00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.716
I just wanted to tell you that we'll be
filming here again tonight.


668
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.880
Yes.

669
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.196
I wanted to ask
if you wanted to appear in it again.


670
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.036
- Is this the final one?
- Yes, we'll be wrapping it up.


671
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.676
- Fine.
- Yeah? Great!


672
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.716
Good, so let's get started.
Ready, Mr. Lajner?


673
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.280
Now you'll have your eyes covered
for a while. Say an hour and a half.


674
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.516
And put your hands behind your back,
because you're tied up.


675
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.756
- Camera!
- Camera rolling.


676
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.800
29 B, take one.

677
00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.320
And action!

678
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.400
You fucking traitor,

679
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.960
tell me where you hid the treasure!

680
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.280
You fucking swine!

681
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.880
Son of a whore!

682
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.480
In the name of the Führer...

683
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.680
Oh, shit.

684
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.680
It has caved in some fifteen inches!

685
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.240
So where is it?

686
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.516
You bastard!

687
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.960
One more time.

688
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.880
We'll practice this
until we have it perfect, okay?


689
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.116
And action!

690
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.640
You swine!

691
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.196
Let's try it one more time,
it has to be perfect.


692
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.000
- Camera rolling!
- 29 B, take four.


693
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.040
And action!

694
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.840
You swine!

695
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.276
In the name of the Führer.

696
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.036
We'll take it down as fast as we can,
pack it up and drive off.


697
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.400
Then we'll have to fill in this hole.

698
00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.720
And we'll see what state the car's in.

699
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.800
I hope it's not completely fucked-up.

700
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.280
Get ready, boys, as soon as
it settles we'll have to finish up.


701
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.280
The road's blocked now.
If someone came this way,


702
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.640
the boys on both sides
of the road would send them packing.


703
00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.840
Let's go!

704
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.316
- Down, down, down!
- Go, go, go!


705
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.640
This has to be really tight
or the wind will get under it on the road.


706
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.920
That's probably fine now.
That was excellent, Mr. Lajner.


707
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.840
The German roles really suit you.
Once it's released, you'll be a star.


708
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.920
Okay.

709
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.640
It's here.

710
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.640
Oh, oh, oh!

711
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.920
It is here.

712
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.800
And it looks as if

713
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.000
it's totally fine.

714
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.276
Like new.

715
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.320
What a relief.

716
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.276
It's so fresh in here.

717
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.400
I can't even smell
that it was underground for two months.


718
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.400
Oh-ho-ho!

719
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.396
It's in there.

720
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.160
No one's stolen it.

721
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.600
We'll fix the container,
strengthen it with a steel structure,


722
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.476
insulate it all
so that it can stay underground


723
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.360
for six months at least. Just in case
that Covid doesn't end by then.


724
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.356
<i>So we started working,</i>

725
00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.996
<i>and the car that half the country
had been looking for</i>


726
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.076
<i>was carefully hid somewhere
where no one would ever look for it.</i>


727
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.480
<i>"The darkest place is under
the candlestick," as the saying goes.</i>


728
00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.796
<i>And in the meantime, while people were</i>

729
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.596
<i>taking pictures with the car
in the shopping centre,</i>


730
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.716
<i>I flew off to Costa
Rica for a few days</i>

731
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.360
<i>to think what to do next.</i>

732
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.480
<i>I owed it to myself,</i>

733
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.760
<i>but mainly to her.</i>

734
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.600
<i>Because of how she copes with everything,</i>

735
00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.476
<i>because of what she's like,</i>

736
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.680
<i>and because of what I'm like
when I'm with her.</i>


737
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.836
<i>I waited my whole life for her.</i>

738
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.560
<i>And now I'm catching up with everything
I didn't manage to do.</i>


739
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.760
<i>And with everything I owe her.</i>

740
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.080
<i>As soon as I've finished this.</i>

741
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.800
- What's that you've got?
- Mathesso. Shall we play?


742
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.716
It's a bit like Concentration,
but smarter.


743
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.596
With numbers and colours.

744
00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.036
I don't like numbers.

745
00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.676
It teaches small children multiplication
without them being aware of it.


746
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.676
I see.

747
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.956
So everything's shifted.

748
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.276
The even coordinates by two
and the odd ones by one.


749
00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.080
And the total number of points is 21.
That's the number of our universe.


750
00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.676
- So shall we try it?
- What?


751
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.280
Oh, sorry.

752
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.640
Something's just occurred to me.

753
00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.956
Göring speaking. Hello, Mr. Lajner.
How are you?


754
00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.076
<i>Lajner speaking.
Can I just ask you when it'll be on TV?</i>


755
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.076
Yes, we're working on it.
It's being edited right now.


756
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.036
You were an excellent Nazi soldier!

757
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.916
You're really nuts.

758
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.516
- We'll let you know as soon as it's ready.
<i>- Okay.</i>


759
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.080
- Thanks, bye.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>


760
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.520
Bye!

761
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.880
So, two weeks of holiday
stretched out to three months, eh?


762
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.436
Who would have thought that
this fucking Covid would last so long.


763
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.040
You know what it looked like?

764
00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.356
As if you'd collected the SMS money

765
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.000
to go surfing
on the other side of the world.


766
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.800
Take it off, I can't
bloody understand a word you're saying.


767
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.396
Hey, brother, it's good to see you!

768
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.516
- So, anything new?
- Yeah, I'd say so.


769
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.876
I've spoken to Frank.

770
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.396
Everything's at a standstill,
there's nothing to bet on.


771
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.876
But as soon as you get going,
they're planning to do more bets.


772
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.080
- What'll they offer bets for?
- For the specific town it's in.


773
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.960
And there'll be much higher odds for that.

774
00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.400
Great!

775
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.800
So this time, we'll
turn it around a bit.

776
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.556
We'll announce it, wait a bit to see
what towns they offer,


777
00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:01.000
and then we'll have a few days
to bury it in one of them.


778
00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.676
Hello. So we're through the worst of it

779
00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:08.000
and the buried Range Rover game
can finally...


780
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.880
That car has been underground
for over six months now.


781
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.156
And I can assure you
that no one's found it yet.


782
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.756
But that'll change soon.

783
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.756
THE CAR GAME IS ON

784
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.116
We've just officially started the
countdown until the start of the game.


785
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.116
And if you're not registered yet,
this is your last chance to take part.


786
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.276
You might think that
after six months underground


787
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.720
that car won't be looking so attractive.

788
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.436
But in the boot of the car
there's still one million to be found.


789
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.120
And you can get over 25 thousand
of these small trees for such a sum.


790
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.760
I want you to think it over
and tell everyone we're back.


791
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.876
Kazma's back.

792
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.556
I was already thinking
you wouldn't launch it.


793
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.716
No one thought
the car would really stay there for,


794
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.676
say, nine months.

795
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.156
<i>It's here at last!</i>

796
00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.036
Give me the car! And why were you
in Costa Rica for six months?


797
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.636
I'm really interested in

798
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.196
what this baby will look like after
so many months underground.


799
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.680
I need to borrow a digger.

800
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.840
This time I'll dig up that car of yours
even if it should kill me!


801
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.480
Kladno. It must be Kladno.

802
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.916
Hang on, that's not what
the biggest odds are for.


803
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.236
I know. But it has to stay
in the Central Bohemia Region.


804
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.956
So we're not cheating the people
who bet on it before Covid.


805
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.800
- Okay.
- Fair enough.


806
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.836
We've only got a few days,
so all hands to the pump.


807
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.036
Here. This is the ideal spot.

808
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.680
There? By the shopping centre?
Between the high-rises?


809
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.440
Steve.

810
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.720
Okay. You're the boss.

811
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.996
A nutter, but the boss.

812
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.036
Linuks, take a look at the utilities
and who they belong to.


813
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.640
Sure.

814
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.916
Good job it's Saturday
and you don't have to go anywhere.


815
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.280
Don't worry,
we'll be together the whole weekend.


816
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.316
- Shall we order some food?
- We'll order some food.


817
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.116
And watch a film.

818
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.480
- And we'll be here.
- And we'll be here.


819
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.040
No!

820
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.160
That's work.

821
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.000
I have to make a call.

822
00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.320
One quick call, okay?

823
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.240
Hang on.

824
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.680
Yes. Yes, hello.

825
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.920
I'm phoning about the lease...

826
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.276
- I'm phoning about the land lease.
<i>- Land lease?</i>


827
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.476
Yes. I'm phoning because
of the plot of land in Kladno.


828
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.916
<i>Okay. And what do you want?</i>

829
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.716
We'd like a short-term lease.

830
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.476
<i>But I'm busy right now.</i>

831
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.276
<i>You can visit me in Orlová tomorrow
and tell me what you want.</i>


832
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.676
Could it wait until Monday?
Because during the weekend I...


833
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.360
<i>Either tomorrow or not at all.
Ring the bell when you arrive.</i>


834
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.156
<i>But don't go inside,
there're guard dogs here.</i>


835
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.436
<i>I'll come to open the gate.</i>

836
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.120
Alright then. We'll drop by.

837
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.676
And where exactly is this Orlová?

838
00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.076
<i>Well, I'm giving you a yellow card
for a stupid question like that.</i>


839
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.080
<i>If you want me to think
you're some twat from Prague,</i>


840
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.796
<i>just carry on, and
I'll show you a circus...</i>

841
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.200
I understand, fine, thanks.
We'll drop by. Goodbye.


842
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.120
What's that?

843
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.680
The man said "twat from Prague"?

844
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.000
- Did he now?
- Uh-huh.


845
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.520
I think so.

846
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.716
<i>Shouldn't we drive
something less conspicuous?</i>


847
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.320
<i>It's fine, the mole is good.</i>

848
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.356
It's pre-arranged,
we just need to finish it.


849
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.676
So you go there, mate.

850
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.036
If he recognises me,
we're screwed, you see?


851
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.240
- I don't know, Kamil.
- Don't call me Kamil, for fuck's sake.


852
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.480
I have this strange feeling, mate.

853
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.640
It won't turn out well.

854
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.680
Come with me.

855
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.756
Steve, you're my manager,
so pull yourself together and sort it out.


856
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.196
- Don't crap yourself all the time.
- I'm not crapping myself.


857
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.760
- You're crapping yourself.
- I'm not crapping myself.


858
00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.440
You are crapping yourself.

859
00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.836
Steve, just go there.

860
00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.480
Really. He was nice
and friendly on the phone.


861
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.000
Yeah. Just do it.

862
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.080
Pigi tea.

863
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.880
A nice fellow.

864
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.840
Fuck.

865
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.880
I forgot about the dogs.

866
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.320
Jesus, what an arsehole.

867
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.996
Chelsea!

868
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.200
Arsenal! Onto the bench!

869
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.400
What do you want?

870
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.760
I'm going to see Mr. Zvěřina.

871
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.436
About what?

872
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.480
Leasing a plot of land.

873
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.200
Wait, I'll come and get you.

874
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.840
Hello.

875
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.876
I won't be leasing anything,
I've changed my mind.


876
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.560
Go home.

877
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.720
But...

878
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.836
It'll just be a small cultural event.

879
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.676
You mean you're going to
build something there?


880
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.036
- No!
- And drive cars?


881
00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.996
Nothing big. Just a few cars.

882
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.916
I'm not going to explain why it's
churned up like a whore's fanny there.


883
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.360
- There's grass there.
- Mr. Zvěřina.


884
00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.120
Jaroslav. A small event, for children.

885
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.640
Didn't you understand?

886
00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.476
You fucking Prague junkie,
can't you understand me?


887
00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.960
You won't be driving any vehicles there!

888
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.240
Chill, let's all calm down, take a deep...

889
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.080
breath, think of a tiny little stream,

890
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.520
raspberries and cream. Okay?

891
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.796
You fucking raspberry,
if I see but one car on that grass,


892
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:10.760
I'll take you by the balls and
drag you across that meadow with a lorry!


893
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.360
You red-haired arsehole,
do I make myself fucking clear?


894
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.040
I'm sorry.

895
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.760
Roman, pass me the rope.

896
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.400
So?

897
00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.320
- What?
- Did we get it?


898
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.396
- Yeah, fine.
- Really?


899
00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.476
We've got it, sure.

900
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.196
The chap
on the balcony didn't look too great.


901
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.716
No, it was a really nice guy.
He didn't even want money.


902
00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.280
- Perfetto.
- Perfetto?


903
00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.200
Yeah, great.

904
00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.240
So let's go.

905
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.000
You drive, mate.

906
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.840
Yeah.

907
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.920
So let's go.

908
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:17.640
- How many cars did you say would be there?
- How should I know? Why?


909
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.680
Just asking.

910
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.040
The train has started
and can't be stopped now.


911
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.276
So that the game
stays the same for everyone


912
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.240
and we don't disadvantage anyone,

913
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.120
we're staying
in the Central Bohemia Region.


914
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.520
So we're in Kladno.

915
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.316
As soon as we arrive,
everyone stays inside,


916
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.236
we close it up, put up fences

917
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.240
and start filming.

918
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.920
See those people gawping?

919
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.560
Close it, close the tarp.

920
00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.520
Well, considering it was really fast,

921
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.520
it's not bad at all.

922
00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.480
You need a big
theatre for a big show.

923
00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.400
And a big theatre

924
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.076
deserves a big backdrop.

925
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.640
So if they cancel the
bets for a town now,

926
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.320
we're stuffed.

927
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.040
- Will it fit in there?
- It has to.


928
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:11.360
- We don't have any other option.
- We really don't.


929
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.760
Jesus Christ!

930
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.440
We can now launch Operation Mole.

931
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.840
Looks fantastic!

932
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.520
Okay, let's hide it
as fast as we can.

933
01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.796
We're inside. It's relatively safe.

934
01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.556
Now we have to get it underground,
that's phase two.


935
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.240
Fine, let's put the tarp back.

936
01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.560
Good, lads, let's get it underground.

937
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.800
<i>We have a problem.
There's a queue forming at the entrance.</i>


938
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.556
Tell them to fuck off,
say there's nothing on today.


939
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.596
<i>There're kids children
from a children's home here.</i>


940
01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.720
<i>The whole class.</i>

941
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.520
- Are you taking the piss?
- That's more than one class.


942
01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.400
What time do you open?

943
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.440
You got any animals here?
Elephants or camels, mate?


944
01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.400
Have you gone nuts?
I don't have any animals.


945
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.760
- How many are there, mate?
<i>- About sixty.</i>


946
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.316
- I'd tell them to fuck off.
- It'll be too obvious. So let's improvise.


947
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.440
- You're right, mate.
- We've got seats, we've got props.


948
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.840
Get the lads that set up the tent,
they're quite handy.


949
01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.200
And you'll be our clown.

950
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.516
- Are you taking the piss?
- I'm not.


951
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.356
You can't send them home.

952
01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.756
- Okay, if it's for free.
- What d'you mean free?


953
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.636
You're nuts. We'll charge admission.

954
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.040
It's against the laws of this world
not to charge any admission at all.


955
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.396
We'll charge admission, just like that.

956
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.916
- How much do you want to charge?
- At least fifty.


957
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.400
- Well, only thirty.
- Forty, but you're a monster.


958
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.880
Get me the circus workers
who put the tent up.


959
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.196
Let's try out what we've got here.

960
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.956
The programme on the back of that coaster?

961
01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.880
Unicycles, then the clown,
and knife-throwing.


962
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.200
Then there's a hola-mop.
What's a hola-mop?


963
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.076
Fine, sure, I get it.

964
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.396
They're coming in in a few minutes.

965
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.120
And we haven't practised anything.
We'll just have to improvise.


966
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.556
I need a magician.

967
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.720
<i>- When?</i>
- Right now?


968
01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.480
- Hey.
- Hey, mate.


969
01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.760
Don't ask any questions,
it'll be real quick.


970
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.880
Tubes, triangles, hula-hoop,
I still don't know what that is.


971
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.116
And then we'll call it
a day and fuck off.

972
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.156
Alright,
we've spent a long time preparing it,


973
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.116
one whole single day!

974
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.960
Let's go.

975
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.560
Show time!

976
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.556
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen, dear children.


977
01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.440
Welcome to our circus and enjoy the show!

978
01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.600
<i>My mom always said I was a clown
and that I'd end up in a circus one day.</i>


979
01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.476
<i>We may be a band of everyday crooks,</i>

980
01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:14.240
<i>but what wouldn't we do for children
in the midst of our top-secret operation.</i>


981
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.476
<i>So on that day,
one hundred of these pre-school kiddies</i>


982
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.880
<i>became part of the biggest con in history.</i>

983
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.240
<i>Good job they're not adults with IDs yet.</i>

984
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.996
Soon the whole country
will be looking for it


985
01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.716
and now they're all
sitting on top of it.

986
01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.796
<i>And their parents don't have a clue
how big a show</i>


987
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.840
<i>they actually took them to.
Got their money's worth for 40 crowns.</i>


988
01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.560
<i>It'll all go like clockwork.</i>

989
01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.720
Christ, the manager's phoning me, mate.

990
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.560
What does he want?

991
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.556
Yes, Mr. Zvěřina, hello.

992
01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.076
You fucking junkie, what're those
fucking circus people doing there?


993
01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.956
It's probably just a misunderstanding.

994
01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.756
I told you you can't do anything there!

995
01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.076
Just you wait for me there, you dog!

996
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.836
- No...
- Roman!


997
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.596
<i>I'll call the coppers, Dad.</i>

998
01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.436
Fuck. He's on his way with the cops.

999
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.996
Fuck, the pigs are on their way.
Where's Patrik?


1000
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.000
Patrik, we're packing up the tent
and getting the fuck out of here.


1001
01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.236
They're building there, driving there,
such fucking arseholes!


1002
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.756
<i>Dear spectators, we are sorry,</i>

1003
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.836
<i>but there has been
an unexpected change of programme.</i>


1004
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.836
<i>Today's performance
is delayed indefinitely.</i>


1005
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.756
<i>Please leave the circus.</i>

1006
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.916
- Arseholes!
- I'll skin him alive!


1007
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.356
Get those people out of that tent!

1008
01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.476
Mommy, I don't want to go home!

1009
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.040
I fucking told him repeatedly
they couldn't build anything here!


1010
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.280
<i>Go, go...</i>

1011
01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.080
I want to go to the circus!

1012
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.920
Prague junkies! 
Fuck, this is terrible!

1013
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.356
What a shitty Praguer,
they fuck everyone over!


1014
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.596
I'll submit a complaint!

1015
01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.756
Pack everything up
and let's get out of here.


1016
01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.156
Bloody comedians!

1017
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.716
Forty crowns down the pan.

1018
01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.880
I'll bury you in that meadow, you cunt!

1019
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.080
Ladies and gentlemen, the show's over.
We're leaving.


1020
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.840
Let's go.

1021
01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.000
Let's go home.

1022
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.040
Oh, fuck, we're screwed!

1023
01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.680
Fuck!

1024
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.880
Come on!
I'm telling you they told me there


1025
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.596
was a circus here a while ago.

1026
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.476
Just look at it! 
It's all ploughed up!

1027
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.400
<i>It's terrible! Fuck!</i>

1028
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.516
Jesus Christ, Steve,

1029
01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.756
you said that the land was leased
for the event.


1030
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.080
Well, I was lying.

1031
01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.356
Oh, you're home already?

1032
01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.800
- Hello.
- Hi, Steve.


1033
01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.800
- Hi, my love.
- Hi.


1034
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.996
What's this here?

1035
01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.120
- Where?
- Here.


1036
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.160
Is that lipstick?

1037
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.560
No.

1038
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.160
We did a performance for children.

1039
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.080
- I see.
- Don't worry.


1040
01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.556
Look.

1041
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.280
Darling, Steve and I

1042
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.520
have to sort something out now. Okay?

1043
01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.800
I'm James Bond.

1044
01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.360
- Cheerio.
- I know. Cheerio.


1045
01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.080
I'M NOT WAITING FOREVER. HURRY UP!

1046
01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.596
The game is on.

1047
01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.556
I've sent an SMS with a clue
to hundreds of thousands of phone numbers.


1048
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.636
However weird it sounds now,

1049
01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.076
take any soft toy,
pack it in a box or a plastic bag


1050
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.359
and take it to the nearest
Zásilkovna issuing point.


1051
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.476
<i>Hundreds of thousands of people
started sending us soft toys</i>


1052
01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.636
<i>and soon we didn't have anywhere
to store them.</i>


1053
01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.435
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the biggest unboxing in the world.


1054
01:08:58.519 --> 01:09:00.280
<i>We got over a million of them.</i>

1055
01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:04.036
<i>This is how our game kept pushing
you further and further in reality.</i>


1056
01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.280
<i>For every task you completed
you got another clue.</i>


1057
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.516
<i>Some cues were on LED screens,
some on the radio,</i>


1058
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.796
<i>on television, in the newspapers,
on billboards...</i>


1059
01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.800
<i>And to the lunatics who got
the furthest, we threw them from a plane.</i>


1060
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.680
<i>Czech Dream. Like by Mr. Klusák.</i>

1061
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.315
<i>The five people who got through
the fastest were chosen for the final.</i>


1062
01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.800
Alright, we've got the finalists,

1063
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.116
now we just have to let
one of them dig it out, and that's it.


1064
01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.996
But our bookmakers must find out about it.

1065
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.036
Because only when it's officially
discovered can they pay out the winnings.


1066
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.716
- It has to public.
- Exactly.


1067
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.520
So let's organize a small event.

1068
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.480
And invite the media.

1069
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.036
I want to broadcast it live.

1070
01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.396
I have a few tickets for a show the like
of which you've never seen before.


1071
01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.036
A war of shovels
and diggers live on TV.

1072
01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.156
And one winner at the end!

1073
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.716
The grand finale
in digging up a car - live!


1074
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.236
- Zvěřina will kill you.
- But first he'll feed you to the dogs.


1075
01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.996
That messed-up football idiot
will keep an eye on things.


1076
01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.316
So just make it fast and inconspicuous.

1077
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.596
- We'll do it on Sunday.
- Sunday?


1078
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.676
<i>A massive success!
The Czech national team has qualified!</i>


1079
01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.360
On Sunday.

1080
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.836
This is the Rádio Kiss prize draw for
two tickets for the Czech national team's


1081
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.236
match on Sunday in the
round of 16 of the UEFA Euro.


1082
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.556
We're calling the winner who will
fly to Budapest this Sunday


1083
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.440
to see this crucial match.

1084
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.196
Well? Chelsea, sit! 
Who's phoning?

1085
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.836
<i>- It's Roman Anděl, Rádio Kiss.</i>
- And what do you want?


1086
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.156
You've just won two tickets to
the Czech national team's match on Sunday!


1087
01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.796
Is this some kind of joke?
I haven't entered any competition.


1088
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.596
This is not a joke.
Jarda, your number has been drawn


1089
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.280
and it looks like today's your lucky day.

1090
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.400
Well, if it's true, I'd actually go.
How many tickets do you have?


1091
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.116
<i>Two tickets. 
And they're yours.</i>

1092
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.520
Oh, man! So I'll take my son.

1093
01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.276
Roman!

1094
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.400
Go, Czechs! Go, Czechs!

1095
01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.440
<i>Pinewoods rustle</i>

1096
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.280
<i>Among the crags</i>

1097
01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:37.280
<i>The garden is glorious
With the blossom of spring</i>


1098
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.000
<i>Paradise on earth it is to see</i>

1099
01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.000
This'll be massive!

1100
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.876
- Go, Czechs!
- Go, Czechs!


1101
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.236
- Hello. Have you got any beer?
- Yes.


1102
01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.636
- Excellent.
- Me and my dad


1103
01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.596
will drink the whole plane dry.

1104
01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.960
- It's like a bloody tomb, isn't it?
- Go, Czechs!


1105
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.440
Want to sit by the window?
We can't see shit anyway.


1106
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.996
It doesn't matter who sits where.

1107
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.076
We're going to the grand finale,
so I hope Fortuna is watching.


1108
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.120
We're off to work now. Let's go.

1109
01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.880
- Beer!
- Thank you!


1110
01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.036
Go, Czechs!

1111
01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.756
This is a perfect smoke screen.
No one'll think of this.


1112
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.600
This is a fucking proper event, at last!

1113
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.916
<i>And the rules are quite simple.</i>

1114
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.036
<i>The first of the five finalists
to reach the container</i>


1115
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.556
<i>wins the car with
one million in the boot.</i>

1116
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.276
<i>Everything according to the rules in front
of the eyes of the referees, the media...</i>


1117
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.356
It's already known that it's in Kladno.

1118
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.800
<i>...and the watching spectators.</i>

1119
01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.876
<i>And after a few hours of
constant scraping and digging,</i>


1120
01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.476
<i>when the meadow was already rutted
like a prostitute's privates,</i>


1121
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.636
<i>one of the contestants
heard a clinking noise.</i>


1122
01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.760
Ladies and gentlemen.

1123
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.996
You're in the right place -
it was the container.


1124
01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.040
The Range Rover and one million crowns
are now yours.


1125
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.920
Seriously?

1126
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.280
<i>One of you won my car.</i>

1127
01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.556
<i>The contestant's name is Kuba,
he's from somewhere near Sokolov.</i>


1128
01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.076
<i>Congratulations, Kuba.
The car went through a lot with me.</i>


1129
01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.480
<i>But now it can tell
a million-crown story, too.</i>


1130
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.720
<i>It's time to show it to you all.</i>

1131
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.480
<i>Because two games are being played
on this field today.</i>


1132
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.796
Kazma on base. 
Is it flowing yet?

1133
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.836
<i>- Over.</i>
- Still nothing. How about you?


1134
01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.880
Zvěřina will kill us,
but the container's been unearthed.


1135
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.680
Okay.

1136
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.276
<i>So that Sunday,
in the meadow outside Kladno,</i>


1137
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.840
<i>Kuba wasn't the only winner.</i>

1138
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.400
<i>It's time for the last magic trick.</i>

1139
01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.480
Damn it, it's happening right now.
You'll shit yourself.


1140
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.076
- Linuks, have we got the dough?
- We have lots of it. We've got enough.


1141
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.640
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the grand finale!


1142
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.480
The Range Rover that's spent
nearly a year underground is here!


1143
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.200
The car's fragrant, clean, unbroken!

1144
01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.520
We can end it now and you can go back.
I think we're done.


1145
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.200
Brother, I want you to know
that if you want something in life,


1146
01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.560
you go for it

1147
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.956
and you overcome all the hurdles
and sacrifice a lot,


1148
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.360
you really can have it
at the end of the journey.


1149
01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.196
<i>So let's sum it up, okay?</i>

1150
01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.476
<i>You've sent the whole country wild
with some fucking game</i>


1151
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.876
<i>to win some fucking car.</i>

1152
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.840
<i>A zillion people got involved,</i>

1153
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.596
<i>now you let some moron win it,</i>

1154
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.880
<i>and while you're at it you rob the biggest
Czech betting company of a few mill, eh?</i>


1155
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.556
<i>Yeah.</i>

1156
01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.716
And don't forget that everything
that you've seen today


1157
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.196
could even be a bit different
and that's not all.


1158
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.640
Bye for now, though.

1159
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.960
That's really rich!

1160
01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.236
So, are we happy?

1161
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.236
Yeah. The odds for the towns went up
and we expected average odds.


1162
01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.716
So we really got the timing
right before it went down again.


1163
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.956
What does that mean?

1164
01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.036
A little bit more got
in than we'd thought.


1165
01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.360
How much?

1166
01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.360
On those 495 accounts we currently have

1167
01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.840
29 million

1168
01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.760
935 thousand and 568 crowns.

1169
01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.760
Fuck!

1170
01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.320
Do you know what that means?

1171
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.560
That we've got money!

1172
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.840
Thirty million, mate!

1173
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.760
Hurrah!

1174
01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.640
Thirty million, mate!

1175
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.080
Quiet!

1176
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.360
What're you doing here?

1177
01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.800
I was calling you. About a hundred times.
Then I thought you'd be here.


1178
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:57.800
I know, sorry. We've had a difficult day,
and we're finishing something off here.


1179
01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.720
Why are you here?

1180
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.036
- Did you bet on it?
- Bet?


1181
01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.636
- No, love, it's just...
- But you knew it in advance.


1182
01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.556
- Are you joking?
- Darling.


1183
01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.600
- It's not the way it looks, okay?
- You stole 30 million?


1184
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.440
I know it sounds crazy,
and that it's a lot of money, but it was


1185
01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.036
a mistake.

1186
01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.636
- So it was just a mistake!
- Yeah, a mistake.


1187
01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.480
Money's really brainwashed you.

1188
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.276
So that's
what all this play-acting's about.


1189
01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.916
Darling, listen to me.

1190
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.876
It got out of hand,
there should have been less.


1191
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.076
Less?

1192
01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.156
It's only a betting company,
they rob people every day.


1193
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.440
Be quiet!

1194
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.360
It's fraud, plain and simple.

1195
01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.640
Jesus.

1196
01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.240
Vendy, wait!

1197
01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.680
Kamil, do you realize what kind
of situation you keep getting me into?


1198
01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.160
There's always something going on.
Always some events, trouble.


1199
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.920
I know.

1200
01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.436
Always something more important than me.

1201
01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.560
- It's not like that.
- I think it is.


1202
01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.360
You just are who you are.

1203
01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.400
And you'll never be different.

1204
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.600
I can't do it anymore.

1205
01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.280
I'm done.

1206
01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:28.440
And I did it

1207
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.520
all for you.

1208
01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.360
- What, you were doing it for her?
- What?


1209
01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.680
- It doesn't matter, let it be.
- Of course it matters.


1210
01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.760
- How do you mean?
- Leave me be, it's none of your business!


1211
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.520
Fuck off, Kamil!

1212
01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:49.196
I'm not just your fucking manager
and you're not a bloody star!


1213
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.796
I'm your mate and buddy!

1214
01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.040
So stop pissing me off
and tell me what this is all about.


1215
01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.000
Sit down.

1216
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.800
Remember when I told you
about that party after which


1217
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.240
I ended up in
the car with that hostess?

1218
01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.600
- Yeah, I do. And?
- Well, I don't remember it much.


1219
01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.560
I was totally trolleyed.
We probably did something and...


1220
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.240
No, I can't...

1221
01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.236
I have a girlfriend. Wait.

1222
01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.040
Wait.

1223
01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.400
Someone took a photo of us in there.

1224
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.876
Bastard!

1225
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.316
That prick started blackmailing me.
He wanted ten million


1226
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.960
or otherwise he'd send it to Vendy
and make it public.


1227
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.320
Who the hell does he think he is?
Ten million!


1228
01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.320
If it's a photographer,
it'll be easy to fix.


1229
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.120
He's in a top position
at one of the biggest betting companies.


1230
01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:01.516
Apparently, his wife was working for Prima
when we did that <i>Prostřeno</i> con.


1231
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.200
It's personal.

1232
01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.480
That bloke hates me.

1233
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.480
I spent a long time
thinking about what to do about it,


1234
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.756
and then I had this idea.

1235
01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:14.040
- To give him his own money.
- Yeah.


1236
01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.516
- Frank?
<i>- We have a problem.</i>


1237
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.836
<i>- We can't withdraw the money.</i>
- What the hell do you mean?


1238
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.480
<i>I'll tell you in person.
Come at once. We're waiting here.</i>


1239
01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.240
So? Are we fucked?

1240
01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.516
Pretty much.
According to the new lottery act


1241
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.996
all gamers must be
verified through Bank ID.


1242
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.476
What the hell does that mean?

1243
01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.716
To get the money paid out
from all those registered accounts


1244
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.156
we now also need verified bank accounts

1245
01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.880
which are in the same name
as the registration.


1246
01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.080
So, even though we have the money,

1247
01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.800
it's tied up in 400 accounts
and we simply can't withdraw it.


1248
01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.596
All we can do
is bet it on something.

1249
01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:34.276
- So we didn't know that earlier? Fuck!
- No. It's new.


1250
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.836
They reorganized the system,
nothing can be done.


1251
01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.520
What shall we do?

1252
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.400
I don't know what to do.

1253
01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.516
But I know who will.

1254
01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.036
<i>He's been around for decades
taking millions from Czech bookies.</i>


1255
01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.920
<i>His picture is on the wall
of every fucking betting shop.</i>


1256
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.480
So that's why you're telling me all this.

1257
01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.600
You need help.

1258
01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.396
Yeah, I need to withdraw it somehow.

1259
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.756
Apparently you're the only
one who can do it.


1260
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.756
I don't do business with strangers.

1261
01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.080
I'm retired now, 
I only gamble for fun.

1262
01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.560
It's a nice story, but try someone else.
Fingers crossed.


1263
01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.560
Ivo said you've got
a score to settle with them.


1264
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.960
It's at Fortuna.

1265
01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.440
At Fortuna?

1266
01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.640
Yeah. You were on
offer as well back then.

1267
01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.200
They probably thought
you were hopeless already.


1268
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.000
I really like it here.

1269
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.040
International waters.

1270
01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.840
Tax breaks, loads of money
and gambling laws


1271
01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.120
as free as a bird.

1272
01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.120
So you say 400 accounts and 30 million?

1273
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.636
Almost thirty.

1274
01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.756
You think I'm going to
pull out a magic suitcase,


1275
01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.276
say abracadabra, and you've got the cash?

1276
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.640
Ever heard of sure betting?

1277
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.436
- Fuck, we really should have killed him.
- Who should you have killed?


1278
01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.040
It doesn't matter, don't worry about it.

1279
01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.840
Sure betting is betting on certainty.

1280
01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.080
Pass me my magic suitcase.

1281
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.480
You didn't get this at Alza, did you?

1282
01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.516
You have to reorganize it all,
redirect it elsewhere.


1283
01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.636
It'll take some time and
you might lose a bit of loose change.


1284
01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.640
Then we'll go on a little trip.

1285
01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.720
You'll get it in cash.
Are you okay with that?


1286
01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.960
Cash is fine.

1287
01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.520
Abracadabra.

1288
01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.560
<i>Life can be really insane sometimes.</i>

1289
01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.196
<i>You just have to be willing to
do insane things.</i>


1290
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.400
<i>And never stop gambling
when fate deals you a bad hand.</i>


1291
01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.276
<i>There's always a way</i>

1292
01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.716
<i>of playing really well, even if
you've been dealt a bad hand.</i>


1293
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.276
<i>I could bore you for hours with
complicated mathematical</i>


1294
01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.436
<i>equations and systems to explain to you</i>

1295
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.356
<i>everything that the lunatic
reorganised, filtered and sieved,</i>


1296
01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.116
<i>but you wouldn't understand it anyway.</i>

1297
01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.756
<i>The important thing is that
he really did manage it in a few days.</i>


1298
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.636
<i>And that now I have my
Jack Daniels with coke for the road</i>


1299
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:49.440
<i>and 27 million in beautifully laundered,
fragrant, one-dollar notes.</i>


1300
01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.676
<i>Why one-dollar notes?</i>

1301
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.040
<i>Only Lubor knows that.
And I really don't give a toss.</i>


1302
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.316
<i>So now I just need to get home,
kiss my girl,</i>


1303
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.956
<i>have a nice lie-in for the first time
in ages, pay off that crook in the morning</i>


1304
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.240
<i>and finally start living a normal,
everyday life.</i>


1305
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.440
<i>Yeah, that'd be a nice happy ending.</i>

1306
01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.280
<i>But life sometimes writes its own stories.</i>

1307
01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.240
Dear God.

1308
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.516
<i>Now I know why you didn't have time for me
and where you spent all those nights.</i>


1309
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.160
<i>You've made your choice. Enjoy your life
and good luck with your one-man show.</i>


1310
01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.040
<i>That was always your first priority.</i>

1311
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.196
<i>Enjoy your new discovery.</i>

1312
01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.036
<i>You've really let me down.
Please don't contact me,</i>


1313
01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.280
<i>I don't trust you anymore
and I don't want to hear you.</i>


1314
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.600
That bastard!

1315
01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.320
<i>I can't get over it.</i>

1316
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.200
<i>Farewell.</i>

1317
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.640
<i>Vendy.</i>

1318
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.240
<i>For a long time I thought
I was really doing it all for her.</i>


1319
01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.360
<i>That was so naïve.</i>

1320
01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:16.080
<i>Most people would do it differently,
but I saw in it another challenge.</i>


1321
01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.036
<i>And when I'm faced with one,
I can't help myself.</i>


1322
01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.520
<i>That's just how I am.</i>

1323
01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.436
<i>And what about the others?</i>

1324
01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.996
<i>Frank quit his job,
but he was so good</i>

1325
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.676
<i>that he was signed up by a competitor.</i>

1326
01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.236
<i>He's a manager
with another betting company now.</i>


1327
01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.956
<i>Laco opened a newsagent's so</i>

1328
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.800
<i>he had something to smoke
for the rest of his days.</i>


1329
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.320
<i>Linuks moved out of his mom's place
and started living</i>


1330
01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.360
<i>at Ruslan's.</i>

1331
01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.956
<i>And Háša helped me out
with that heap of soft toys.</i>


1332
01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.836
<i>I knew that I'd do something
good with them one day.</i>


1333
01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.716
<i>And the decision was made.</i>

1334
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:53.520
<i>We took them to Ukraine
when that fucking war broke out.</i>


1335
01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.080
<i>That's where the children
needed them most.</i>


1336
01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.516
Thank you for thinking about us.

1337
01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.636
<i>And all of you who sent them
deserve a big thanks.</i>


1338
01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.600
With those soft toys we also gave them
a piece of our hearts.


1339
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.436
<i>And if you're wondering
how I dealt with him,</i>


1340
01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.840
<i>well, I didn't.</i>

1341
01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.760
<i>It's not important anymore.</i>

1342
01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.120
<i>But there aren't a lot of people there
who wear a golden tie every day.</i>


1343
01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.800
<i>Life will deal with him itself.</i>

1344
01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.436
<i>She was the best girl I've ever met.</i>

1345
01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.996
<i>She left my life so fast
I couldn't tell her a thing.</i>


1346
01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:30.356
I miss my cats.

1347
01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.676
<i>People often leave relationships without
listening to the other person's story.</i>


1348
01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.676
<i>Life isn't a film and I know
you can't change anything.</i>


1349
01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.716
<i>But it occurred to me
that it could be a good way</i>


1350
01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.676
<i>of telling her everything one day.</i>

1351
01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:45.596
I want her to know what really happened.

1352
01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.000
And how do you want to do that?

1353
01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.240
I want everyone to know.

1354
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.800
If a lot of people see it,
then she'll find out, too.


1355
01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.836
<i>Have you gone mad?
If this gets out, Fortuna will see it.</i>


1356
01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.596
<i>And what if we show everyone
a slightly different point of view?</i>


1357
01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.560
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1358
01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.636
<i>At the only place where
you can deal drugs with impunity,</i>


1359
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.396
<i>get chased by cops,</i>

1360
01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.596
<i>or show everyone
how you scammed a betting company.</i>


1361
01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.756
<i>So if you're sitting in the cinema now,</i>

1362
01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.876
<i>you've probably seen
just another invented story</i>


1363
01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.516
<i>written by a scriptwriter on a couch.</i>

1364
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.876
Maybe it never happened.

1365
01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:37.240
But maybe you're all in it
together with us.


1366
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.836
This is 22 million crowns
in one-dollar notes.


1367
01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.240
Imagine all the things
I could do with that right now.


1368
01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.320
Let's play the last game.

1369
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:56.196
I locked up the money in this safe.

1370
01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.436
To get to it,
you need a card and the correct password.


1371
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.680
The card that you probably
have in your pocket now.


1372
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:06.160
I distributed them
in cinemas across the country.


1373
01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.640
The password for the card is a
ten-digit number.


1374
01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.236
And every one of you
can work it out now.

1375
01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.360
All you have to
do is decipher the code.

1376
01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.036
It's not easy.

1377
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.600
But what you have just seen
was, in reality, not a film.


1378
01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.560
But a manual.

1379
01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.436
That safe is somewhere out there.

1380
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.636
Whoever's the first to
put in the correct password


1381
01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.636
will be the owner of all the money.

1382
01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.440
But hurry, time's flying.
It won't be there forever.


1383
01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.156
And there's one card in circulation
that doesn't need any password at all.


1384
01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.956
- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VICTORY.
- THIS CARD IS A WINNER!


1385
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.240
Maybe it's yours.

1386
01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.400
<i>One million dollars is a lot of money.</i>

1387
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.160
<i>But also a lot of responsibility.</i>

1388
01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.840
<i>Try and see what it's like having it.</i>

1389
01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:14.720
<i>And all of us will see if we've taught you
something over the last few years.</i>


1390
01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:41.516
THIS FILM WAS MADE BY PEOPLE
WHO WERE NOT AFRAID TO FACE REALITY


1391
01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:45.676
AND BELIEVED IN THE IDEA THAT A FILM
STORY CAN BE MADE OUTSIDE THE SAFETY


1392
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.836
OF FILM LOCATIONS,
WITHOUT A PRE-SCRIPTED STORY LINE.


1393
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.236
I MADE THIS FILM TO GIVE COURAGE
TO ALL THOSE


1394
01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:57.720
WHO THINK THAT THEIR CRAZY DREAMS
ARE TOO FAR-FETCHED...


1395
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:32.396
<i>- Lajner speaking.</i>
- Yes, hello, Mr. Lajner.


1396
01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.436
<i>- Yes?</i>
- So finally it's out.


1397
01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:40.036
<i>Really? And where will they broadcast it?
Will it be on TV or in the cinema?</i>


1398
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.116
You can come and
see it with your wife.

1399
01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.476
<i>- That's incredible.</i>
- Yeah, it's in the cinemas.


1400
01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.396
<i>Great, so me and my wife
will go and see it.</i>


1401
01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:51.276
<i>We're really looking forward to it,
thank you and see you later.</i>


1402
01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.080
THE SECRET TRENCH

1403
01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.040
It's all fucked now!

1404
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.196
We simply can't afford to lose this fight!

1405
01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.200
We must take clear measures.

1406
01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.600
Jürgen, Stefan, Hans, Fritz, Franz.

1407
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.720
For you, this fucking war's over!

1408
01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.836
Go away!

1409
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.280
Fuck!

1410
01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.240
Fuck!

1411
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.240
You three who stayed...

1412
01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.440
No!

1413
01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.716
Herman?

1414
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.516
Go without me,

1415
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.520
I can't manage it.

1416
01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.356
No, I'm not going without you.

1417
01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.080
I wanted to tell you something...

1418
01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.880
Herman!

1419
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.760
No!

1420
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.440
Herman!

1421
01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.436
KAZMA KAZMITCH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

1422

TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY.

1427
01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.556
TO THE MEMORY OF OUR FRIEND
WHO WORKED ON THE FILM


1428
01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.036
BUT WILL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN...
JAKUB "JAMES" JANOVEC
