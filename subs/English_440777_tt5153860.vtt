2
00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:22.517
Welcome!

3
00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:24.283
Ladies and Gentlemen...!

4
00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:29.330
To the final round of the biannual
free fighting championship!


5
00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:38.645
Tonight we have a very special event.

6
00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:44.040
On one side, we have
Claire, "The Bull" Stronsom.


7
00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:51.189
On the other...!

8
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.042
You've heard her name
echo through these walls.


9
00:00:55.648 --> 00:00:56.983
A myth!

10
00:00:57.315 --> 00:00:59.435
An urban legend!

11
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.319
Right here!
Before your very own eyes!


12
00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.213
Bex "The Beast" Holt!

13
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.953
No weapons...

14
00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:12.376
No dying.

15
00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:42.499
Come on!
Knock her out!


16
00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:40.574
Hey!
Show me your hands, now!


17
00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:43.296
Hands up!
Now! Come on!


18
00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.456
Hands up!

19
00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.405
Buster, behave!

20
00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:04.449
Hey, Quincy!

21
00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:08.371
It's gonna be your lucky day today,
buddy, what do you say?


22
00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:13.305
I know, I know...

23
00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:16.423
Hey, do you wanna know a little secret?

24
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:21.421
You're my favorite dog of all.

25
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:25.298
This is one of our favorites.

26
00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:26.765
Hey, sweetie!

27
00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:29.005
- Three legs?
- Yeah...


28
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:29.996
How did that happen?

29
00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:32.131
He was in an accident
with his owner...


30
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.136
Aw...

31
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.330
What?

32
00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.525
Are you heroes or what?

33
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:39.014
- Who is this little guy over here?
- Who?


34
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:43.340
This guy is actually
another nice guy.


35
00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:45.495
He loves his belly rubs.

36
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:51.817
- How old is he?
- Ahm, three?


37
00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:52.628
Yes.

38
00:04:03.663 --> 00:04:05.624
Becca, could you
lock up for the day?


39
00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.381
There's one more client with Randy
and that should be it for the day.


40
00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.815
Yeah, sure thing.

41
00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:14.497
Still daydreaming about that place?

42
00:04:14.497 --> 00:04:15.547
Sorry, I was...

43
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.625
Some thing,
it's good to dream, hey...


44
00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.381
Do a good work around here
and we'll help you in any way we can.


45
00:04:20.437 --> 00:04:22.542
- Thanks.
- All right.


46
00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:25.541
Sorry guys,
we're closed for the day.


47
00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.377
No worries, please...
We lost my dog.


48
00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:32.994
And we just came by to
see if it turned up.


49
00:04:32.994 --> 00:04:34.934
Please, I beg you,
it'll take two seconds...


50
00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:36.419
Two seconds,
two seconds.


51
00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.777
Well, let me check in the system.

52
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:47.580
What breed is it?

53
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.584
It's a brown and white pit-bull.

54
00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.023
No, we don't have anything
in the system, guys.


55
00:04:59.023 --> 00:05:00.460
Look again.

56
00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:03.841
I already looked, we don't have it,
we don't have the dog.


57
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:05.985
Take your little fingers
and look again.


58
00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:07.717
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

59
00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:09.959
I'm gonna tell you one
more fucking time...


60
00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.767
Look for my
fucking dog.


61
00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:13.145
I need you to leave right now.

62
00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:15.527
Get me my dog!
Get me my dog!


63
00:05:15.527 --> 00:05:18.164
I'll kill every fucking dog in there!
Bring it!


64
00:05:18.164 --> 00:05:19.312
I got it.

65
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.067
If you go past that door,
I'm gonna call he cops.


66
00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:35.114
Wait! You're not even going
the right way, just wait.


67
00:05:35.387 --> 00:05:39.261
Get the fuck off! What's wrong with you?
Are you a fucking stupid ass?


68
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.102
Hey, asshole!

69
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.229
Damn! You look good!

70
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.269
How did you find me?

71
00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:47.988
Five million hits in less than a week?
That's pretty good!


72
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:52.292
What?
Did you not wanna be found?


73
00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:54.780
Are you OK?

74
00:06:56.634 --> 00:06:59.403
That is the last
thing I am right now.

75
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.854
What happened?

76
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.307
I owe money to some
very bad people.


77
00:07:05.307 --> 00:07:07.694
Of course you do... and?

78
00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:09.272
I'm not lying,
they'll fucking kill me...


79
00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:11.669
They'll fucking kill me
if I don't give them the money.


80
00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.356
- I'm serious, Becca.
- Really?


81
00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.506
How much?

82
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.871
A hundred K.

83
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:21.406
Even if I had that kind of cash,
I wouldn't...


84
00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.301
But you could have it.

85
00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:31.426
I'm not gonna fight.

86
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:33.245
I'm not asking you to.

87
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:35.962
Just help me win.
I've got a group of girls...


88
00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:37.298
No.

89
00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:40.388
The prize is 150 K.

90
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.356
The girls and I agree,

91
00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:46.360
25 for you and we'll
just split the rest.


92
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.543
Well, I don't want your money, Kate.

93
00:07:48.907 --> 00:07:51.031
What do you want then?

94
00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:00.679
Get the fuck out.

95
00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:04.044
I knew this was a waste of time.

96
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.604
Yeah, she called in a couple of
days ago. She got me worried.


97
00:08:14.604 --> 00:08:18.045
Yeah, big surprise, Dad.

98
00:08:18.325 --> 00:08:21.823
Make your own decisions.
Just don't forget about the consequences.


99
00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:23.525
I don't wanna do it!

100
00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:26.739
I didn't wanna do it then, I don't
wanna do it now. I don't wanna do it!


101
00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:30.806
Yeah, neither did I wanna do it either,
but look, here we are.


102
00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.048
Do you expect us to be the fucking
Brady Bunch when you get out?


103
00:08:34.217 --> 00:08:37.074
Hold hands by the camp fire?
Sing Kum-Ba-Yah?


104
00:08:37.074 --> 00:08:39.980
No, I expect to see
my daughter still alive.


105
00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:42.307
But if you don't
help your sister,


106
00:08:42.307 --> 00:08:44.160
I might not get to.

107
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:55.454
- I'll sleep on it.
- All right, sleep on it.


108
00:08:57.783 --> 00:08:59.399
I love you.

109
00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:01.173
I love you too.

110
00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:13.286
That's gonna be $3.200 for the flight.

111
00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:15.075
That's one way?

112
00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:20.466
Yes, that's one way.
Would you like to book for return?


113
00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:25.486
No, erm, no return.

114
00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:29.824
You know what?
Ahm, I'm gonna have to call back.


115
00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:33.488
- Thank you, though.
- OK, anything else I can help you with?


116
00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:36.901
- That's all.
- No problem. Have a good day.


117
00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:39.529
You too.

118
00:11:12.827 --> 00:11:15.247
Jeb, Jeb, right hand.

119
00:11:15.653 --> 00:11:17.955
Jeb, Jeb, right hand.

120
00:11:18.286 --> 00:11:19.939
You're slouching!
No slouch!


121
00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:23.848
On you, that's... Jeb, Jeb, right hand!
Good! Again!


122
00:11:23.888 --> 00:11:26.545
Jeb, Jeb, right hand!
Good!


123
00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:30.944
OK, OK, OK... take five.

124
00:11:30.944 --> 00:11:33.797
- I got you.
- Yeah, whatever.


125
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:39.446
Don't tell me! It's that feeling
you get when you're in here.


126
00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:41.571
There's nothing
quite like it, right?


127
00:11:41.788 --> 00:11:43.177
Yeah, yeah...

128
00:11:44.272 --> 00:11:45.762
How you doing?

129
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:50.404
I've seen better days but as long
as the engine keeps running...


130
00:11:53.548 --> 00:11:56.665
- Where have you been all these years?
- L.A.


131
00:11:56.968 --> 00:11:59.444
Aha! Chasing your dreams?

132
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.965
Just trying to wash away all the filth.

133
00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:04.790
Why come back to the mud?

134
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.602
I'm gonna train Kate.

135
00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:11.705
They're gonna drag you
back to that snake pit.


136
00:12:11.748 --> 00:12:13.676
You girls go there...

137
00:12:13.676 --> 00:12:17.161
Sooner or later,
you're going to get bit.


138
00:12:19.459 --> 00:12:21.242
Does your father know about this?

139
00:12:21.318 --> 00:12:23.012
Kate didn't leave us much of a choice.

140
00:12:23.027 --> 00:12:26.831
Hey, don't... you know what?
Don't say that. There's always a choice.


141
00:12:28.952 --> 00:12:30.866
Where is she?

142
00:12:33.902 --> 00:12:35.694
You really wanna know?

143
00:12:46.596 --> 00:12:49.456
Better the devil you know, I guess...

144
00:12:51.558 --> 00:12:53.894
You're still doing it wrong, you know?

145
00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:17.390
I'm not gonna ask you
why you're here.


146
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.434
You're not gonna ask me to fight.

147
00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:25.210
I'll have to undo all your bad habits.

148
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.528
Build you from the ground up.

149
00:13:28.733 --> 00:13:31.238
Guess we'll give it a whirl then, huh?

150
00:13:33.699 --> 00:13:36.902
- I've got other girls too.
- That's fine.


151
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.881
You're not fucking with me, are you?

152
00:13:42.496 --> 00:13:44.666
There's still payment involved?

153
00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:48.986
Yes!

154
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.975
Then, no,
I'm not fucking with you.


155
00:13:55.742 --> 00:13:57.982
You get out tomorrow, right?

156
00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:01.547
Oh, you're not going
to bail me out of here?


157
00:14:09.438 --> 00:14:12.527
- See you at three.
- Are you serious?


158
00:14:13.008 --> 00:14:14.338
Becca!

159
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.239
Oh, come on!

160
00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:18.326
Becca?

161
00:14:21.957 --> 00:14:23.795
You're a cop?

162
00:14:30.228 --> 00:14:31.786
What the fuck?

163
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:33.942
Where have you been all this time?

164
00:14:34.703 --> 00:14:36.552
I can take you
for a coffee and explain?

165
00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:38.625
I already had a cup of coffee today.

166
00:14:38.665 --> 00:14:40.527
OK, erm...

167
00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:43.266
A beer?

168
00:14:43.303 --> 00:14:47.622
No, you can tell me whatever you got
to say to me right here, right now.


169
00:14:50.528 --> 00:14:52.940
You know? That's fine.
I don't really care.


170
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.109
Just wait,
I can explain...


171
00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:55.555
Wait?

172
00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:59.171
It's been five years, Becca.

173
00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:01.343
Five years.

174
00:15:02.064 --> 00:15:04.904
I stopped waiting for you
a long time ago.


175
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.078
Look, I'm sorry.
You have no idea what I went through.


176
00:15:07.078 --> 00:15:09.615
Don't you think it's
a little bit late for that?


177
00:15:13.836 --> 00:15:16.502
Excuse me, I've got work to do.

178
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.520
You're ready?

179
00:15:37.082 --> 00:15:38.515
You're late!

180
00:15:40.102 --> 00:15:42.503
Yeah, well, I had an
emergency at home.


181
00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:44.707
Yeah, yeah, dog ate
your homework?


182
00:15:44.731 --> 00:15:46.507
This place's changed a bit.

183
00:15:46.507 --> 00:15:49.293
This place runs an import-export
company for the most part.


184
00:15:49.318 --> 00:15:51.313
The real money is in the fights.

185
00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:52.497
Holt...?

186
00:15:53.043 --> 00:15:54.250
What is this?

187
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.685
Just bringing by some new customers.
Back off.


188
00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:00.159
Does Landon know about it?

189
00:16:01.514 --> 00:16:04.638
She's got money...
Isn't that what matters?


190
00:16:11.675 --> 00:16:13.122
Girlfriend of yours?

191
00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:16.374
She's just a guard dog...
All bark and no bite.


192
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:21.217
Seems like a lot of trouble to be
betting on illegal fights in Sin City.


193
00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:24.937
No, we got a lot of little depo junkies
that can't bet on the big shows.


194
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.788
Sounds like a
shitty Comfort version.


195
00:16:27.813 --> 00:16:29.605
Anything high stakes?

196
00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:32.418
Oh, we get a couple of high
rollers that come in here.


197
00:16:32.504 --> 00:16:34.370
Why would the come here?

198
00:16:34.395 --> 00:16:36.451
They burnt too many bridges.
This place is a nest


199
00:16:36.451 --> 00:16:38.161
for all kinds of
illegal activity.


200
00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:39.912
Dog fights, cock fights...

201
00:16:39.912 --> 00:16:43.421
Most people come here to watch two
women beat the shit out of each other.


202
00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.495
Lovely.

203
00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:56.155
Hey, Sal, you got the door?

204
00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:54.021
"Bull" wins again, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you...


205
00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:57.171
for your bets. Collect your winnings
at the register on your way out.


206
00:17:57.171 --> 00:18:01.171
And may we see you
and your green paper again soon.


207
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.997
Hey!

208
00:18:03.578 --> 00:18:07.195
You don't fight today, do you?
I didn't see you in the entries.


209
00:18:07.195 --> 00:18:09.833
No, just being a tour guide.

210
00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.283
Hmm... welcome then.

211
00:18:12.283 --> 00:18:13.458
How may I be of service?

212
00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:16.149
Slow down, guv'nor...
she's off limits.


213
00:18:16.174 --> 00:18:19.517
Yeah, I've heard that before.
My name's Micah.


214
00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:21.689
Becca.

215
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.294
You have beautiful eyes.

216
00:18:24.365 --> 00:18:27.283
Have you seen them lately?
They're great.


217
00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:32.577
Anyway, I should be back to work...
before I'm made redundant.


218
00:18:32.602 --> 00:18:33.839
Cheers.

219
00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:37.124
A friend?

220
00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:39.738
Yeah, he's a good guy.

221
00:18:39.763 --> 00:18:42.352
He makes sure we don't break any rules.

222
00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:44.533
Which are...?

223
00:18:44.533 --> 00:18:46.818
No weapons.
No dying.


224
00:18:47.748 --> 00:18:49.726
You mean "killing"?

225
00:18:49.751 --> 00:18:54.220
No, Jones makes it clear from the start,
if you die, it's on you.


226
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:55.574
Jones?

227
00:18:55.574 --> 00:18:58.268
Yeah, it's his joint.

228
00:18:58.268 --> 00:19:00.163
He used to be a fight
promoter until he got banned


229
00:19:00.163 --> 00:19:02.665
by the Commission for
illegal betting.


230
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.307
He runs a lot
of stuff out of here...

231
00:19:07.383 --> 00:19:09.746
But he started Pit Nights
to give fighters a home.


232
00:19:09.884 --> 00:19:12.276
A chance to earn some extra cash.

233
00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:16.043
Yeah, I'm sure he's
quite the philanthropist.


234
00:19:20.315 --> 00:19:22.541
He's the guy you owe money to?

235
00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:29.045
What about the cops?

236
00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:33.146
That's the Chief of police right there.

237
00:19:37.672 --> 00:19:39.849
Welcome home, Becca.

238
00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.216
Hey!

239
00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:56.893
Katy, babe!
You're out!


240
00:19:56.893 --> 00:20:01.462
And you brought mama a
fresh piece of meat from the snabber.


241
00:20:01.462 --> 00:20:04.220
- Becca, meet Winter.
- Why Winter?


242
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.935
'Cos I knock bitches out cold!

243
00:20:08.617 --> 00:20:09.680
Good.

244
00:20:13.826 --> 00:20:15.717
This is Lisa Nu Wing...

245
00:20:15.717 --> 00:20:18.983
She's our sexy Vietnamese ringleader.

246
00:20:19.373 --> 00:20:21.755
She's got as mid-ass kick too.

247
00:20:21.935 --> 00:20:25.028
And this over here is little Gaby.

248
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.757
Little, feisty Gaby.

249
00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:31.723
What do you think?

250
00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:35.235
Can they fight?

251
00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:43.509
Let's go, Barbie.

252
00:20:43.522 --> 00:20:45.408
She's so pretty, right?

253
00:20:52.021 --> 00:20:53.582
You ready?

254
00:21:00.236 --> 00:21:01.751
Let's go!

255
00:21:02.507 --> 00:21:04.353
Let's do this.

256
00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:44.753
You suck!

257
00:21:51.282 --> 00:21:54.394
Too many quesadillas, puta.

258
00:21:54.527 --> 00:21:56.486
Why don't you come in here
and see what you can do?


259
00:21:56.486 --> 00:21:59.345
Shit!
I thought you'd never ask!


260
00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.974
Fuck you.

261
00:22:14.306 --> 00:22:16.430
All right, Lisa,
you got this.


262
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.069
Come on, you got this.

263
00:22:32.444 --> 00:22:34.709
- Shake it up!
- Come on, come on!


264
00:22:41.155 --> 00:22:43.513
- You're in the corner!
- Get out of there!


265
00:22:54.292 --> 00:22:57.960
You're flat-footed. You'll never
generate enough power like that.


266
00:22:57.991 --> 00:23:02.087
Your technique is sloppy
and she sacrifices power for speed.


267
00:23:02.087 --> 00:23:05.601
Kate, put a muzzle on this bitch
before I break her face.


268
00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:08.219
You are aware you have to make
contact to do that, right?


269
00:23:08.219 --> 00:23:10.659
Are you gonna tell us
who your mystery girl is, huh?


270
00:23:10.659 --> 00:23:12.365
She's your new trainer.

271
00:23:12.493 --> 00:23:14.338
She's Bex Holt.

272
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:18.563
- You're Bex?
- Who the fuck is Bex?


273
00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:21.501
She used to fight in "The Brew"
back in the day. You're "Bex Beast".


274
00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:24.339
But she isn't,
she's a dog-whisperer now, huh?


275
00:23:24.339 --> 00:23:25.519
Right?

276
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:30.951
See you guys tomorrow.

277
00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:46.382
So, you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?


278
00:23:48.271 --> 00:23:50.569
No, I got other plans.

279
00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:52.016
Really?

280
00:24:06.513 --> 00:24:09.854
Becca?
What the hell are you doing?


281
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.495
Sleeping?

282
00:24:11.495 --> 00:24:14.015
Aren't you real smart?
In an open car like this.


283
00:24:14.015 --> 00:24:16.621
Grab you bag, I'm gonna
drive you to the gym.


284
00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:20.887
OK, just stop pointing that
flashlight on my face.


285
00:24:21.817 --> 00:24:23.576
Let me get that for you.

286
00:24:23.576 --> 00:24:25.021
Thanks.

287
00:24:25.544 --> 00:24:28.359
How long have you been doing
this security gig for?


288
00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:30.764
Since you Dad went to prison.

289
00:24:30.841 --> 00:24:33.218
You know,
this place is a money pit.


290
00:24:33.426 --> 00:24:36.038
I gotta do this task
just to keep it going.


291
00:24:37.214 --> 00:24:39.443
Sam better make good
on getting out,


292
00:24:39.443 --> 00:24:42.708
because I can't swing
this record much longer.


293
00:24:43.795 --> 00:24:46.076
Anyway, the room's a little small...

294
00:24:46.076 --> 00:24:48.911
I use it sometimes when
I'm too beat-up to go home but...


295
00:24:48.911 --> 00:24:50.706
I'm sure it'll be fine.

296
00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:53.060
It's great.

297
00:24:56.413 --> 00:24:57.919
What happened there?

298
00:24:58.124 --> 00:24:59.602
Oh, that?

299
00:24:59.655 --> 00:25:01.621
I used to have a fighting
fish in there...


300
00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:04.917
Until my ex-wife took one of my
trophies and threw it at him.


301
00:25:04.942 --> 00:25:08.504
Well, she actually threw it at me
but I ducked and...


302
00:25:08.872 --> 00:25:10.616
That's what happened.

303
00:25:11.089 --> 00:25:12.461
She sounds lovely.

304
00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:14.162
Yeah, she was lovely.

305
00:25:14.356 --> 00:25:17.436
In fact, I never realized what
a good house-keeper she was.


306
00:25:17.461 --> 00:25:20.564
We got divorced,
she kept the house!


307
00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:25.742
Look, I gotta tell you something.

308
00:25:25.972 --> 00:25:28.255
I need to get it off my chest.

309
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.309
I still can't believe
your Dad killed those kids.


310
00:25:31.309 --> 00:25:33.705
Even after what they did to Kate.

311
00:25:36.031 --> 00:25:37.123
Why not?

312
00:25:37.129 --> 00:25:40.480
Your Dad and I have known each other
since we were seven years old.


313
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.424
We used to chase girls together.

314
00:25:42.424 --> 00:25:44.598
We drank our first beer together.

315
00:25:44.749 --> 00:25:47.168
We even built this place together.

316
00:25:47.168 --> 00:25:50.501
And I've seen him go through
some tough shit in his life.


317
00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:54.297
But he was always a kind person.

318
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.549
I just never thought
it was in his nature.


319
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:04.561
All right, all right,
all right, come on... Circle up.


320
00:26:11.448 --> 00:26:13.437
Fighting in its purest form

321
00:26:13.437 --> 00:26:15.997
is about subduing your opponent
without actually fighting.


322
00:26:16.104 --> 00:26:18.990
First class and you hand us
some shitty paradox?


323
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.663
What are we supposed
to do with that?


324
00:26:20.671 --> 00:26:23.095
It's an impossibility in most cases,

325
00:26:23.095 --> 00:26:26.419
but the closer you are to that form,

326
00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:29.319
the easier it is
to defeat your opponent.


327
00:26:30.838 --> 00:26:33.400
What's the most important quality
a fighter should have?


328
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.479
- Strength!
- Speed!


329
00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:36.674
- Come on. - No.
- You're wrong.  - I told you.


330
00:26:36.674 --> 00:26:39.322
- Brains.
- Yes.


331
00:26:43.564 --> 00:26:46.726
You can be strong,
you can be fast, but...


332
00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:49.996
If you're not smart about
how you fight...


333
00:26:51.396 --> 00:26:53.339
None of it matters.

334
00:26:53.459 --> 00:26:54.727
Excuse me!

335
00:26:54.727 --> 00:26:56.274
Teacher, a question.

336
00:26:56.274 --> 00:27:00.159
Are we gonna get going?
Or is this a theory class?


337
00:27:04.116 --> 00:27:05.884
OK, spring roll.

338
00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:17.556
Think about it.
I already know you're coming fast.


339
00:27:17.556 --> 00:27:21.227
You already know I'm faster than you so,
what do you do?


340
00:27:22.128 --> 00:27:25.454
Plant your feet.
Speed is not your friend here.


341
00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:35.251
You gotta stop beating
that orange chicken.


342
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:39.200
You went for the face
and sacrificed your footing.


343
00:27:39.878 --> 00:27:41.414
Again!

344
00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:43.712
All right, Morpheus.

345
00:27:45.838 --> 00:27:47.611
Last try.

346
00:27:56.424 --> 00:27:58.441
In your face!

347
00:27:58.441 --> 00:27:59.773
Good!

348
00:28:00.143 --> 00:28:01.562
Next?

349
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.250
I was a bit harsh the other night.

350
00:28:13.939 --> 00:28:17.464
- What?
- I was a bit harsh the other night.


351
00:28:19.945 --> 00:28:21.396
An apology?

352
00:28:21.396 --> 00:28:25.618
No, I think I'm entitled to my reaction.

353
00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:31.390
I'm just reconsidering your request.

354
00:28:34.412 --> 00:28:36.158
I'm sorry for everything.

355
00:28:36.158 --> 00:28:39.019
I'm sorry for not calling,
I'm sorry for not coming back, I'm...


356
00:28:39.263 --> 00:28:41.759
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry.


357
00:28:42.544 --> 00:28:46.913
After what happened to Kate and Dad,
I didn't know up from down.


358
00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:50.402
Why did you come back?

359
00:28:51.719 --> 00:28:54.410
I'm helping Kate with some...

360
00:28:54.493 --> 00:28:56.167
personal issues.

361
00:28:59.061 --> 00:29:00.790
Where's the uniform?

362
00:29:01.082 --> 00:29:03.904
Hmm.
I'm off duty.


363
00:29:03.904 --> 00:29:06.686
- When did that happen?
- About two hours ago.


364
00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:08.614
No, your badge.

365
00:29:09.753 --> 00:29:11.396
Three years ago.

366
00:29:12.012 --> 00:29:16.399
I got fired from the track.
Decided to join the Force.


367
00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:20.100
Decent pay, benefits, a future.

368
00:29:24.032 --> 00:29:25.716
Where are you staying?

369
00:29:27.007 --> 00:29:28.774
At the gym.

370
00:29:29.194 --> 00:29:32.124
- Just up the street.
- I know where it is.


371
00:29:34.756 --> 00:29:39.264
You know, I actually,
I should really get going.


372
00:29:39.744 --> 00:29:42.762
Try not to go Houdini on me again.

373
00:29:46.758 --> 00:29:49.133
You've gotta be smart
about how you fight.


374
00:29:49.181 --> 00:29:51.831
And how you fight depends
on who you fight.


375
00:29:51.862 --> 00:29:53.478
What do you see here?

376
00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.037
Existential torment?

377
00:29:55.037 --> 00:29:57.412
Why don't you come
give it a spin, Socrates?


378
00:29:57.412 --> 00:30:00.470
It's Nietzsche to be precise,
but you wouldn't know that, right?


379
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.194
- Why don't you try to hit me, little shit?
- Don't mind if I do.


380
00:30:02.194 --> 00:30:04.218
- See if I can even feel it.
- OK.


381
00:30:04.218 --> 00:30:07.765
Off of Zeke's point,
just like him, the Bull's thick.


382
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.531
- But it's all muscle.
- She's a big bitch, for sure!


383
00:30:11.531 --> 00:30:13.482
You're a big bitch for sure!

384
00:30:13.482 --> 00:30:16.381
Yeah, but I flow
like a butterfly!


385
00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:20.023
You got it, now you see me,
now you don't!


386
00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:24.340
Muscle acts like armor,

387
00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:27.119
the more you have,
the more protected you are.


388
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.616
So, there's no point
attacking here... here.


389
00:30:32.944 --> 00:30:34.508
Or there.

390
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:39.245
- Can I hit back?
- Would love it if you did.


391
00:30:40.702 --> 00:30:45.200
So, we're gonna learn how to manipulate
the joints through technique.


392
00:30:45.225 --> 00:30:48.098
And attack where
there's no muscle. Right?


393
00:30:48.969 --> 00:30:50.208
Come on.

394
00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:53.679
Elbows, wrist, knees.

395
00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:57.276
It's not about size and strength,
it's about technique.


396
00:30:57.347 --> 00:31:00.480
I think we all get the point, Becca.
We get the point.


397
00:31:01.984 --> 00:31:03.667
What about the throat?

398
00:31:03.754 --> 00:31:05.772
It's a dangerous spot, Kate.

399
00:31:05.772 --> 00:31:08.796
- Yeah, but lay everyone out.
- Or kill them.


400
00:31:09.138 --> 00:31:13.085
OK. Just break in case
of emergency then, OK?


401
00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:17.978
So, who's up first?

402
00:31:20.444 --> 00:31:23.211
Hey, hey, one at a time,
one at a time.


403
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.851
Got any dinner plans?

404
00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:28.206
No.

405
00:31:29.591 --> 00:31:33.404
I think that maybe you could come by...
See my place?


406
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:37.124
I'm exhausted, Kate.
Maybe another time.


407
00:31:37.474 --> 00:31:39.039
Come on, man,
I'm trying.


408
00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:41.299
You're never gonna stop asking, are you?

409
00:31:43.647 --> 00:31:45.316
Is that a yes?

410
00:31:48.195 --> 00:31:50.132
You own this place?

411
00:31:50.786 --> 00:31:52.218
I rent.

412
00:31:52.396 --> 00:31:55.145
- Mummy!
- Hey!


413
00:31:56.221 --> 00:31:58.395
Hi, Kate! Sorry the place
is kind of a mess,


414
00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:02.101
we were playing indoor tag-mat,
got completely out of control.


415
00:32:02.126 --> 00:32:03.730
Thank you... wow.

416
00:32:04.074 --> 00:32:06.275
Thank you so much for getting her.

417
00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:08.981
This is my sister, Becca.

418
00:32:09.087 --> 00:32:12.087
Oh, hi!
I've heard so much about you.


419
00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:14.836
All good things, of course.

420
00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:16.982
You've a beautiful family.

421
00:32:17.057 --> 00:32:18.616
Thanks.

422
00:32:19.617 --> 00:32:22.928
OK, well, I will let you...

423
00:32:22.928 --> 00:32:25.778
Oh, yeah, sorry, 
I've got, mhm...

424
00:32:25.778 --> 00:32:28.124
Here we go.
Do you wanna give it to her?


425
00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:30.778
Thank you.

426
00:32:31.423 --> 00:32:33.897
Bye, ahm, it's nice to meet you.

427
00:32:35.242 --> 00:32:38.989
Lily, I want you
to meet someone.


428
00:32:39.121 --> 00:32:41.227
This is your Aunt Becca.

429
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:45.647
Don't hide... hey.

430
00:32:46.128 --> 00:32:47.939
What do we say when we meet someone?

431
00:32:47.939 --> 00:32:49.474
Nice to meet you.

432
00:32:49.474 --> 00:32:51.568
Right!
Will you say it to her, please?


433
00:32:51.568 --> 00:32:53.316
Nice to meet you.

434
00:32:57.306 --> 00:32:59.000
- Hi, Lily.

435
00:33:00.214 --> 00:33:03.163
- How old are you?
- Five.


436
00:33:06.012 --> 00:33:11.087
- Hey, why don't you go clean your
room for Aunt Becca, OK? - OK. - OK.


437
00:33:19.638 --> 00:33:23.350
So... a whole mess in here.

438
00:33:38.598 --> 00:33:41.678
So, this guy you owe money to...
Jones.


439
00:33:42.175 --> 00:33:44.131
What about him?

440
00:33:44.782 --> 00:33:46.871
How well do you know him?

441
00:33:47.126 --> 00:33:48.895
Well enough.

442
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.406
He's a business man,
ruthless...


443
00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:55.165
One of those not-to-be-fucked-with
kind of guys.


444
00:33:57.668 --> 00:34:01.929
How ruthless?
Can you be a bit more specific?


445
00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:06.344
A couple of months ago,

446
00:34:06.523 --> 00:34:09.096
these two guys
showed up at the Pit.


447
00:34:09.253 --> 00:34:11.554
Just coming fresh of a hot streak.

448
00:34:12.036 --> 00:34:14.235
Fifty grand buy-in.

449
00:34:14.805 --> 00:34:17.576
And they bet it all on this first-timer.

450
00:34:17.867 --> 00:34:19.212
She didn't stand a chance.

451
00:34:19.212 --> 00:34:22.463
She was up against one of the
toughest chicks in the entire circle.


452
00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:25.148
And yet, she won.

453
00:34:25.691 --> 00:34:28.581
- Four hundred grand pay-out.
- Jesus!


454
00:34:28.904 --> 00:34:29.876
Yap.

455
00:34:30.065 --> 00:34:34.016
The problem came when Jones found out
the whole thing was staged.


456
00:34:42.566 --> 00:34:47.450
Both fighters were in on it
and a hundred grand each.


457
00:34:49.157 --> 00:34:50.445
Why?

458
00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:53.451
Because I needed the money
for medical bills.


459
00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:57.254
What's wrong with you, Kate? Hmm?
What's so wrong with you?


460
00:34:57.473 --> 00:34:59.298
I'm done, mum.

461
00:35:00.024 --> 00:35:02.094
Lay back,
you're ready?


462
00:35:02.279 --> 00:35:04.029
Can Aunt Becca do it?

463
00:35:04.167 --> 00:35:07.370
Of course, sweetie.
You can show her how.


464
00:35:11.004 --> 00:35:12.819
Open it.

465
00:35:18.155 --> 00:35:21.671
So, put that in there,

466
00:35:21.671 --> 00:35:25.163
and then push that
and then put it to three,


467
00:35:25.163 --> 00:35:27.624
and then I'll get all better.

468
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:30.532
Push that thing
and put that right there.


469
00:35:31.884 --> 00:35:34.481
- Then turn it to three.
- Ready?


470
00:35:35.912 --> 00:35:37.920
Push that thing.

471
00:35:42.577 --> 00:35:45.486
- All better?
- A-ha! Mummy?


472
00:35:45.628 --> 00:35:50.614
Oh, honey, there...
why don't you go show me your room, huh?


473
00:35:51.103 --> 00:35:52.738
Come here.

474
00:36:28.117 --> 00:36:29.944
Excuse me.

475
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.179
Are you planning on building something?

476
00:36:42.237 --> 00:36:45.574
Thinking about it.
A house, maybe?


477
00:36:46.031 --> 00:36:47.272
Hmm.

478
00:36:47.536 --> 00:36:49.339
In France?

479
00:36:50.049 --> 00:36:55.516
Oh, no... I wanna go to Africa,
the part where they speak French.


480
00:36:59.376 --> 00:37:01.614
Pourquoi l'Afrique?

481
00:37:03.294 --> 00:37:04.906
Pourquoi pas?

482
00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:08.541
Oui... Pourquoi pas.

483
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.093
I guess a little adventure is good
when you're young.


484
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.921
How about you?

485
00:37:20.542 --> 00:37:23.343
It's a little hobby of mine. I...

486
00:37:24.406 --> 00:37:26.957
I build bird houses on my spare time.

487
00:37:28.022 --> 00:37:29.322
Hmm...

488
00:37:29.665 --> 00:37:32.561
- How many have you built?
- Phew...


489
00:37:33.081 --> 00:37:34.497
Hundreds.

490
00:37:34.632 --> 00:37:36.348
- Wow.
- Hmm.


491
00:37:36.984 --> 00:37:38.282
Do you sell them?

492
00:37:38.282 --> 00:37:43.235
No, no, it's more of a therapeutic type
of thing I do... helps me to relax.


493
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.631
- Have you tried a stress ball?
- Hmm.


494
00:37:45.854 --> 00:37:48.289
Stress ball, Zen garden...

495
00:37:48.487 --> 00:37:50.169
I've tried it all...

496
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:54.228
But there's nothing
like building a house...


497
00:37:54.253 --> 00:37:59.585
Where animals can come, take shelter,
eat, procreate...


498
00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:02.601
It helps just to make
things right in my world.


499
00:38:02.841 --> 00:38:04.952
Must be a hell of a world.

500
00:38:04.952 --> 00:38:07.831
Hell's got nothing on this,
mademoiselle.


501
00:38:09.655 --> 00:38:13.286
Well, good luck with
everything, Mister...?


502
00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:16.547
Je m'appelle Landon. Et vous?

503
00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:19.823
Je m'appelle Rebecca.

504
00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:24.086
Enchanté.

505
00:38:25.759 --> 00:38:27.824
You got strong hands.

506
00:38:28.052 --> 00:38:30.560
Builder's hands.

507
00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:32.282
Merci.

508
00:38:33.877 --> 00:38:37.294
Au revoir!
Petit oiseau.


509
00:38:51.039 --> 00:38:54.026
- Yo, Becca!

510
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.952
Hey.

511
00:38:56.825 --> 00:38:59.931
So, I've been doing some digging,

512
00:38:59.931 --> 00:39:03.833
and a friend of mine told me about
her first time at a bin night fight.


513
00:39:05.385 --> 00:39:10.664
She said she bet on this
huge Goliath-looking girl,


514
00:39:10.664 --> 00:39:13.637
who was fighting a scrawny newbie.

515
00:39:13.748 --> 00:39:14.781
So, check this,

516
00:39:14.781 --> 00:39:18.813
not only does this tiny ass bunny
beat the Goliath...


517
00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:20.814
but when the house
wouldn't pay her,


518
00:39:20.814 --> 00:39:23.758
she took out the two
bouncers at the joint!


519
00:39:24.065 --> 00:39:26.770
She said as she was
walking out to the Brewery,


520
00:39:26.826 --> 00:39:29.592
all she could hear was
the crowd chanting:


521
00:39:29.592 --> 00:39:34.812
"Bex, Bex, Bex!"

522
00:39:35.432 --> 00:39:39.024
- Sound familiar?
- A nice story.


523
00:39:40.436 --> 00:39:44.367
Why don't you go rest up? Maybe someone
will be chanting your name tonight, huh?


524
00:39:44.623 --> 00:39:48.013
All right.
I see how it is.


525
00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:54.415
This conversation is not over...
Bexy Bex.


526
00:39:54.415 --> 00:39:55.731
OK.

527
00:40:06.235 --> 00:40:10.390
Did she say two bouncers?
I remember three!


528
00:40:19.336 --> 00:40:23.619
- You're going to the Pit, right?
- What would you have me do?


529
00:40:23.627 --> 00:40:27.817
The both of you should just go.
Take Lily and leave!


530
00:40:33.355 --> 00:40:35.334
It's just a fight.

531
00:40:35.334 --> 00:40:37.288
What's the worst that can happen?

532
00:40:37.288 --> 00:40:39.663
She loses... she's dead anyways.

533
00:40:39.663 --> 00:40:44.022
You're wrong!
Far worst things can happen.


534
00:40:45.064 --> 00:40:47.441
I expect to see my
daughter still alive,


535
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:49.836
but if you don't
help your sister,


536
00:40:49.836 --> 00:40:51.444
I might not get to.

537
00:40:57.643 --> 00:40:59.612
Ladies and Gentlemen,

538
00:40:59.612 --> 00:41:05.700
welcome to the qualifying round
of the Free Fight Championship!


539
00:41:06.628 --> 00:41:08.790
That's right, bitches.
Come on!


540
00:41:10.961 --> 00:41:15.108
You know the game,
you know the rules.


541
00:41:15.577 --> 00:41:19.871
The challenger that wins,
advances to the next round.


542
00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:21.802
No weapons...

543
00:41:22.398 --> 00:41:24.037
No dying.

544
00:41:24.574 --> 00:41:27.270
Gaby, remember what I told you
and you'll be just fine.


545
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.744
One punch to the throat.

546
00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:37.069
Mademoiselle Rebecca...

547
00:41:38.003 --> 00:41:39.983
Fancy seeing you here.

548
00:41:39.983 --> 00:41:41.289
Yeah.

549
00:41:43.373 --> 00:41:46.055
How's the French coming along?

550
00:41:46.146 --> 00:41:49.202
Good.
How are the bird houses?


551
00:41:49.533 --> 00:41:51.347
Spectacular.

552
00:41:51.924 --> 00:41:54.025
Would you like to take a look?

553
00:41:55.557 --> 00:41:57.727
The fights are gonna start.

554
00:41:58.332 --> 00:42:01.555
Hmm,  hmm...
No, they won't start without me.


555
00:42:01.839 --> 00:42:03.646
I own the place.

556
00:42:06.572 --> 00:42:08.293
Shall we?

557
00:42:10.474 --> 00:42:12.495
It's right this way.

558
00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:19.300
Claire, sunshine...

559
00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:22.711
Would you be so kind
and give us the room, please?


560
00:42:23.622 --> 00:42:25.271
Everything all right?

561
00:42:25.271 --> 00:42:27.079
Spectacular.

562
00:42:27.297 --> 00:42:31.297
I'm just showing our new friend here
what I've built.


563
00:42:52.147 --> 00:42:54.414
I'll be right outside.

564
00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.526
Awkward.

565
00:43:02.016 --> 00:43:04.900
She likes to mark her territory.

566
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.330
She's very loyal, that one.

567
00:43:08.728 --> 00:43:10.868
She's a part of my family now.

568
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:15.409
Family means so much to me.

569
00:43:15.953 --> 00:43:19.086
Yeah... speaking of family...

570
00:43:21.793 --> 00:43:24.953
The Jones family crest,
Celtic in origin.


571
00:43:24.953 --> 00:43:26.056
Impressive!

572
00:43:26.056 --> 00:43:27.524
Merci.

573
00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.601
I come from a long line of...

574
00:43:33.715 --> 00:43:36.791
degenerate drinkers and gamblers.

575
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.588
But that's my family.

576
00:43:40.943 --> 00:43:42.518
You can't choose your family.

577
00:43:42.518 --> 00:43:45.729
You take the good with the bad.

578
00:43:47.722 --> 00:43:49.536
Do you gamble much?

579
00:43:49.965 --> 00:43:51.679
From time to time.

580
00:43:51.704 --> 00:43:58.480
I don't.
I lean more towards secure investments.


581
00:43:59.097 --> 00:44:01.245
Guaranteed pay-outs.

582
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:02.992
Is there such a thing?

583
00:44:02.992 --> 00:44:04.822
Oui. Yes. Of course!

584
00:44:04.822 --> 00:44:07.869
One just has to look
for the right opportunity.


585
00:44:07.869 --> 00:44:12.008
The right amount of risk
versus the right amount of incentive,


586
00:44:12.008 --> 00:44:16.657
can equal a guaranteed
return on an investment.


587
00:44:17.557 --> 00:44:19.954
Although there are times where
the variables don't add up,


588
00:44:19.954 --> 00:44:24.978
and usually someone has tampered
with another wise, good formula.


589
00:44:28.246 --> 00:44:30.703
I wanna show you something.

590
00:44:31.145 --> 00:44:33.478
By the way,
who are you betting on tonight?


591
00:44:33.585 --> 00:44:38.406
Wait, don't tell me, don't tell me
'cos I already know.


592
00:44:40.767 --> 00:44:42.905
Would you like an ice-cream?

593
00:44:43.652 --> 00:44:45.115
No, thanks.

594
00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.971
I've got lots of flavors.

595
00:44:50.811 --> 00:44:52.545
Ooops.

596
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.864
I put Kate's old friends in time-out.

597
00:45:00.262 --> 00:45:02.727
Excuse me...

598
00:45:04.553 --> 00:45:05.925
Hmmm.

599
00:45:15.257 --> 00:45:17.299
They took my ice-cream...

600
00:45:17.335 --> 00:45:19.480
without my permission.

601
00:45:20.966 --> 00:45:23.596
So I had to set them free.

602
00:45:24.776 --> 00:45:29.529
Do you think Kate or
any of her new friends...


603
00:45:30.569 --> 00:45:32.965
have a chance at winning?

604
00:45:35.395 --> 00:45:39.472
'Cos if none of them win,
where's the guarantee?


605
00:45:40.329 --> 00:45:42.547
Who's gonna pay me back?

606
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.746
[INDISTINCT]

607
00:45:50.912 --> 00:45:55.151
We inherit the problems,
these are our issues now.


608
00:45:58.051 --> 00:46:00.105
I like Kate...

609
00:46:00.539 --> 00:46:02.789
but she's not very...

610
00:46:04.002 --> 00:46:06.552
How do you say...?
Smart.


611
00:46:08.795 --> 00:46:11.010
What I do like...

612
00:46:11.035 --> 00:46:13.064
Your father.

613
00:46:13.089 --> 00:46:20.677
Ah, there's a man who's willing to
sacrifice himself to protect the flock.


614
00:46:22.018 --> 00:46:23.869
Admirable.

615
00:46:27.526 --> 00:46:29.633
Little Kate, erm...

616
00:46:30.627 --> 00:46:33.235
She's not a part of my family.

617
00:46:36.843 --> 00:46:39.048
When it's done,

618
00:46:39.593 --> 00:46:41.975
the debt is paid.

619
00:46:43.445 --> 00:46:47.867
Don't come near her or our family again.

620
00:46:51.356 --> 00:46:53.252
Got it?

621
00:46:54.628 --> 00:46:56.900
Yes, I got it!

622
00:47:00.972 --> 00:47:03.504
Welcome back...

623
00:47:04.176 --> 00:47:05.842
Bex.

624
00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:10.971
Baby-face.

625
00:47:12.046 --> 00:47:15.119
Rip her up,
rip her up, you got it!


626
00:47:17.165 --> 00:47:18.876
You fuck her up.

627
00:47:27.608 --> 00:47:29.242
Take your time.

628
00:47:34.187 --> 00:47:36.514
Get up! Get out of there!
Get up!


629
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:39.213
Hit the floor!

630
00:47:39.268 --> 00:47:40.213
Break it!

631
00:47:40.213 --> 00:47:41.786
Tap, Winter, tap!

632
00:47:41.811 --> 00:47:42.906
Break it!

633
00:47:42.906 --> 00:47:45.643
She's gonna break her arm,
tap it out!


634
00:47:45.681 --> 00:47:47.414
Winter, tap!

635
00:47:55.426 --> 00:47:59.681
Piece of shit.
I swear Ima get up and fuck you up.


636
00:48:04.086 --> 00:48:07.466
That's it, baby.
You did it for Papa, baby.


637
00:48:14.806 --> 00:48:16.940
Oh, no, you're good,
you're good.


638
00:48:17.284 --> 00:48:18.282
You're good.

639
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:21.156
But if you're gonna do it,
you might as well do it right.


640
00:48:22.118 --> 00:48:23.530
Grab one more...

641
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.938
Come on!

642
00:48:31.396 --> 00:48:33.315
That felt good.

643
00:48:39.993 --> 00:48:41.257
Yeah!

644
00:48:42.159 --> 00:48:43.990
I got a lot
of money riding on this.

645
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.170
Good!

646
00:49:32.022 --> 00:49:34.441
Hmmm...
two more chances.


647
00:50:03.457 --> 00:50:04.737
Yeah!

648
00:50:04.808 --> 00:50:07.384
That's what I'm talking about!

649
00:50:27.595 --> 00:50:29.575
Come on, get her!
Come on!


650
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:54.860
- OK, let me help you.
- Yeah.


651
00:51:05.027 --> 00:51:07.692
And now we're down to one.

652
00:51:07.717 --> 00:51:11.729
Wakie, wakie!
Come on, Gaby, baby, breathe...


653
00:51:14.611 --> 00:51:16.932
What are you doing?

654
00:51:17.576 --> 00:51:19.673
You smell lovely.

655
00:51:23.328 --> 00:51:26.555
- I won, right?
- Of course, you did!


656
00:51:26.642 --> 00:51:30.835
Bitches are lined up outside
so you can sign their titties... look...


657
00:51:31.877 --> 00:51:35.152
Yo all, come on, let's go,
I need a drink, for real.


658
00:51:35.152 --> 00:51:37.366
- She ought to rest.
- Come on.


659
00:51:38.382 --> 00:51:40.066
Come with us.

660
00:51:40.429 --> 00:51:43.785
I'm not going and neither should you.

661
00:51:43.785 --> 00:51:46.640
Becca, the fight is in two days.
I think I can handle one drink...


662
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.222
Are you listening to yourself?
You're the last one, you're it.


663
00:51:51.222 --> 00:51:55.047
If you lose,
how are you gonna pay this guy back?


664
00:51:59.953 --> 00:52:01.854
I can't do this.

665
00:52:02.002 --> 00:52:03.288
Hey!

666
00:52:04.119 --> 00:52:06.930
I have a bad feeling about this.

667
00:52:06.955 --> 00:52:09.096
It's gonna be fine!

668
00:52:09.902 --> 00:52:11.972
Look, I know I've been a fuck-up...

669
00:52:12.169 --> 00:52:14.694
That's not who I am anymore!

670
00:52:15.664 --> 00:52:17.950
Kiss and make up already!

671
00:52:21.151 --> 00:52:22.705
Come with us.

672
00:52:24.661 --> 00:52:26.712
I'll see you tomorrow.

673
00:52:32.943 --> 00:52:35.872
Come on, Kate!
Let's go get some poison tonight!


674
00:52:36.193 --> 00:52:38.750
- Get up!
- I'll give you some poison!


675
00:52:41.095 --> 00:52:43.633
You want a piece of this, fuckface?

676
00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:46.955
Yes, please.

677
00:52:49.403 --> 00:52:51.259
Calm down.

678
00:52:52.876 --> 00:52:55.101
- We'll get some tequila...
- Wow!


679
00:52:56.698 --> 00:52:59.666
- All right, OK.
- I'm cool. - Woooow!


680
00:53:29.811 --> 00:53:31.389
Who is it?

681
00:53:31.389 --> 00:53:33.213
Hey, it's Potter.

682
00:53:34.771 --> 00:53:36.448
Hold on.

683
00:53:43.966 --> 00:53:46.617
It's stuck!
Come down here!


684
00:53:49.804 --> 00:53:51.900
- Hey!
- Hey!


685
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:55.024
I'm not interrupting
anything in here, am I?


686
00:53:55.577 --> 00:53:58.355
No, I was hitting the bags.

687
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.421
I see...
D'you work up an appetite?


688
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:04.871
I was gonna order from Joey's.

689
00:54:10.269 --> 00:54:11.429
OK.

690
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:13.735
- OK!
- All right!


691
00:54:20.823 --> 00:54:22.238
What?

692
00:54:24.422 --> 00:54:26.302
I needed this.

693
00:54:28.011 --> 00:54:29.449
Me too.

694
00:55:10.312 --> 00:55:11.293
No.

695
00:55:31.133 --> 00:55:33.683
- Well done, officer.
- Yeah.


696
00:55:35.274 --> 00:55:37.348
You mocking me?

697
00:55:39.084 --> 00:55:41.144
What are you gonna do about it?

698
00:55:41.935 --> 00:55:44.510
Don't make me get the handcuffs.

699
00:55:44.642 --> 00:55:47.584
Promises, promises...

700
00:55:51.842 --> 00:55:52.974
Hello?

701
00:55:52.974 --> 00:55:55.878
Hello, this is Doctor Badell
from Valley Medical Center.


702
00:55:55.878 --> 00:55:57.278
Is this Becca Holt?

703
00:55:57.278 --> 00:55:59.574
- What?
- Is this Becca Holt?


704
00:55:59.574 --> 00:56:04.283
We have your sister here, Kate Holt, in IC.
We need you to come in immediately.


705
00:56:04.283 --> 00:56:05.859
Where?

706
00:56:34.966 --> 00:56:37.936
You look like shit.

707
00:56:40.423 --> 00:56:42.024
Hey, champ.

708
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.588
Lily...

709
00:56:44.588 --> 00:56:46.294
She's fine.

710
00:56:47.731 --> 00:56:49.997
She's with Zeke.

711
00:56:50.833 --> 00:56:53.899
Take care of her, OK?

712
00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.658
No, no...

713
00:56:57.144 --> 00:57:00.918
You'll be just fine.
You can take care of her yourself.


714
00:57:02.568 --> 00:57:05.861
If I make it out of this...

715
00:57:07.764 --> 00:57:10.424
I won't make it out there.

716
00:57:25.232 --> 00:57:27.310
I love you.

717
00:57:32.808 --> 00:57:35.862
I got about 25 grand stashed away.

718
00:57:36.554 --> 00:57:38.454
It's not enough.

719
00:57:38.909 --> 00:57:40.651
What about you?

720
00:57:41.298 --> 00:57:43.613
- I can handle one fight.
- Yeah.


721
00:57:43.613 --> 00:57:46.728
Or maybe I should just follow you...
Call your ex and the cavalry,


722
00:57:46.728 --> 00:57:49.886
and put an end to this bullshit
you're getting yourself into!


723
00:57:51.151 --> 00:57:53.747
It's not gonna do any good
and you know that.


724
00:57:53.747 --> 00:57:57.864
I just need to know you have Lily
and Dad if I can't pull this off.


725
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:02.319
You know I will, you know that.
But what about you?


726
00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:08.388
How long's it been
since you fought? Huh?


727
00:58:09.077 --> 00:58:13.076
You think you're just gonna step
in there and beat that monster?


728
00:58:13.463 --> 00:58:15.653
Shit, Becca, come on!

729
00:58:18.793 --> 00:58:21.247
Guaranteed pay-outs.

730
00:58:22.647 --> 00:58:23.972
What?

731
00:58:29.857 --> 00:58:32.071
How much money
did you say you have?


732
00:58:39.435 --> 00:58:42.699
Welcome...
Ladies and Gentlemen...!


733
00:58:42.699 --> 00:58:47.880
To the final round of the biannual
free fighting championship!


734
00:58:53.127 --> 00:58:57.269
Tonight we have a very special event.

735
00:58:57.804 --> 00:59:02.498
On one side, we have
Claire "The Bull" Stronsom.


736
00:59:08.037 --> 00:59:10.047
On the other...!

737
00:59:10.125 --> 00:59:13.651
You've heard her name
echo through these walls.


738
00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:17.824
A myth...
An urban legend!


739
00:59:18.103 --> 00:59:21.823
Right here!
Before your very own eyes!


740
00:59:21.823 --> 00:59:25.116
Bex "The Beast" Holt!

741
00:59:34.306 --> 00:59:37.454
Ladies, ready?

742
00:59:38.223 --> 00:59:42.492
No weapons...
No dying...


743
01:00:25.871 --> 01:00:27.696
Come on!
Knock her out!


744
01:00:47.617 --> 01:00:49.724
You know you got this, Becca!

745
01:01:00.164 --> 01:01:05.484
You're still undefeated FFC champion,
Claire "Bull" Stronsom!


746
01:01:27.887 --> 01:01:29.184
OK.

747
01:01:30.978 --> 01:01:33.500
Give it up for the "The Bull", yeah?

748
01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:48.584
Your winnings.

749
01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:53.501
- Thanks.
- Yeah.


750
01:01:55.797 --> 01:01:58.007
You should have won.

751
01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:08.008
Excuse me.

752
01:02:09.162 --> 01:02:11.005
Miss, I really don't think she should...

753
01:02:11.005 --> 01:02:13.397
That's fine.
She can sit right here.


754
01:02:13.422 --> 01:02:15.262
Here, Lily.

755
01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:19.396
OK, I'm gonna go see
how mummy's doing, OK?


756
01:02:19.396 --> 01:02:21.628
You just sight right
here until I get back.


757
01:02:21.786 --> 01:02:24.558
When she gets better,
will you stay with us?


758
01:02:24.558 --> 01:02:27.918
You be a good girl,
and we'll see, OK?


759
01:02:37.784 --> 01:02:39.243
Hi!

760
01:02:52.188 --> 01:02:55.683
Breathe, Kate.
Breathe, baby...


761
01:02:57.105 --> 01:02:58.757
Nurse!

762
01:02:59.574 --> 01:03:02.042
- Help!
- What happened?


763
01:03:02.277 --> 01:03:05.331
- She pulled the tube out.
- That's impossible, she can't move.


764
01:03:05.401 --> 01:03:06.625
Oh, God!

765
01:03:07.154 --> 01:03:09.870
Code blue 316,
code blue 316!


766
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:13.919
Who unplugged her ECG? I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait outside, please, and wait for me there!


767
01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:17.208
- Plug-out time? - Two and half minutes.
- Cardiac arrest? - No respiratory.


768
01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:21.042
- The crash cart? - It's already on it's way.
- So, it's coming, we're starting out with 100!


769
01:03:23.129 --> 01:03:24.749
Where's that cart?

770
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:28.247
Wait, hey, miss, wait! Hey!

771
01:03:28.356 --> 01:03:31.907
- Excuse me! Miss, hey...!
-Lily, stay right there, OK?


772
01:03:31.984 --> 01:03:33.804
Take care of her!

773
01:04:04.773 --> 01:04:06.337
Talk!

774
01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:11.108
Bex "The Beast",
What are you gonna do?


775
01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:14.953
Are you gonna kill me?
Kill me!


776
01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:18.936
Talk!

777
01:04:19.584 --> 01:04:22.635
It was him, wasn't it?
It was him!


778
01:04:22.635 --> 01:04:24.905
We lost everything tonight,

779
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:27.164
betting on Bex "The Beast".

780
01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.169
You shouldn't have done that.

781
01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:34.930
You're gonna have to hurry if you
wanna save the rest of the family.


782
01:06:00.299 --> 01:06:02.479
Oh, shit.

783
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.354
Everything all right in there, Holt?

784
01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:09.299
No, but it will be.

785
01:06:10.408 --> 01:06:12.740
Don't hurt yourself now.

786
01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:15.596
Big day for you tomorrow.

787
01:06:15.742 --> 01:06:18.820
Yeah, it will be for you
if I don't get the system working.


788
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:22.126
Hell, D block can go a couple of days
without hot water.


789
01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:23.997
Oh, yeah?

790
01:06:24.332 --> 01:06:27.094
Ever met the guys in D block?

791
01:06:27.379 --> 01:06:29.802
No, never had the pleasure.

792
01:06:29.863 --> 01:06:32.873
Well, pleasure is the last thing
you get from those guys.


793
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:36.560
Yeah, well, if you fix this, we ain't
gonna have no problems now, are we?


794
01:06:47.894 --> 01:06:51.679
You know the water PH levels
are way off the chart, right?


795
01:06:51.679 --> 01:06:54.176
You should have that checked out soon.

796
01:06:55.268 --> 01:06:58.746
What are you, a fucking
scientist now, old man?


797
01:07:03.698 --> 01:07:09.164
Erm... well, I got a master's degree
in chemical engineering, so, yes.


798
01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:16.198
You know, like, PH level can cause
corrosive damages to your pipe ring.


799
01:07:17.696 --> 01:07:19.761
Like this one.

800
01:08:42.362 --> 01:08:44.846
Not bad for an old man, huh...

801
01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.734
I don't know what got
into these guys...


802
01:09:15.891 --> 01:09:18.949
Beat each other up pretty
bad, I tried to stop them,


803
01:09:18.949 --> 01:09:21.324
they just wouldn't listen.

804
01:09:21.778 --> 01:09:24.396
Look, I don't want any trouble.

805
01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:26.477
Stop tight there, Holt.

806
01:09:26.502 --> 01:09:28.969
If you're gonna shoot
me with that Taser,


807
01:09:28.969 --> 01:09:33.660
there's no guarantee it's gonna
paralyze me, if it doesn't... well...


808
01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:38.034
I don't know if I can keep my cool,
if you know what I mean...


809
01:09:40.817 --> 01:09:42.111
Yeah.

810
01:09:42.857 --> 01:09:45.396
Well, I did my job...

811
01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:47.932
fixed that pipe...

812
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:52.155
and in return,
what I would really love...


813
01:09:53.036 --> 01:09:55.324
is to make a phone call.

814
01:09:58.325 --> 01:09:59.972
Yeah.

815
01:10:04.398 --> 01:10:06.247
Good choice.

816
01:10:11.948 --> 01:10:13.958
She's asleep.

817
01:10:18.332 --> 01:10:20.667
What do you wanna do now?

818
01:10:21.533 --> 01:10:24.000
I can help you.

819
01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:30.081
Paul Tardielo, remember him?

820
01:10:31.953 --> 01:10:35.432
They found his blood
smeared on my Dad's shirt.


821
01:10:36.008 --> 01:10:38.233
Along with two others, remember?

822
01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.558
Yeah.

823
01:10:39.558 --> 01:10:42.794
He always had a sick obsession with her.

824
01:10:42.794 --> 01:10:44.572
And now, he's dead.

825
01:10:44.597 --> 01:10:48.002
Your Dad made sure of that
when he bashed in his skull.


826
01:10:49.685 --> 01:10:52.050
But he didn't.

827
01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:58.274
He didn't find Kate crying that night.

828
01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:08.342
I did.

829
01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:12.132
I wanted to call the cops,
I wanted to tell Dad, but...


830
01:11:13.949 --> 01:11:16.031
More than that...

831
01:11:16.658 --> 01:11:19.453
I just wanted them to die.

832
01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:25.882
They were laughing when I got there.

833
01:11:28.763 --> 01:11:30.557
I killed them.

834
01:11:33.053 --> 01:11:35.279
And I killed them some more.

835
01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.787
And I liked it.

836
01:11:51.185 --> 01:11:55.356
By the time Kate told Dad
and he got there,


837
01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.996
it was too late for them.

838
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.607
He gave me his hoodie...

839
01:12:05.426 --> 01:12:08.900
covered my face
and told me to walk straight home.


840
01:12:18.929 --> 01:12:22.751
I let my Dad take the fall
for a crime he didn't even commit.


841
01:12:26.724 --> 01:12:29.638
I thought he'd be fine
if I left, you know?


842
01:12:30.792 --> 01:12:33.086
That I could just leave it behind.

843
01:12:36.838 --> 01:12:41.753
Every move has led me to this...
Right now.


844
01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:48.691
I'd like to know why.

845
01:13:00.671 --> 01:13:02.305
Hello?

846
01:13:03.064 --> 01:13:04.555
You OK?

847
01:13:04.841 --> 01:13:06.876
I'm fine, Dad.

848
01:13:09.075 --> 01:13:10.673
But Kate...

849
01:13:13.395 --> 01:13:15.165
She's gone.

850
01:13:18.779 --> 01:13:22.320
Listen, take Lily to Bakersfield.

851
01:13:22.812 --> 01:13:24.853
- I'll be there...
- No!


852
01:13:25.518 --> 01:13:28.803
Listen to me, try to understand
what I'm trying to tell you.


853
01:13:28.803 --> 01:13:30.087
I know what
you're thinking.


854
01:13:30.087 --> 01:13:33.341
If you do this
and it doesn't work out well,


855
01:13:33.341 --> 01:13:37.760
everything we've done, this five years,
everything will be for nothing.


856
01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:40.808
We'll be back where we started,
do you understand?


857
01:13:44.326 --> 01:13:47.273
I can help you,
we can fix this.


858
01:13:47.539 --> 01:13:49.704
I don't wanna fix it.

859
01:13:50.706 --> 01:13:52.866
I wanna end it!

860
01:14:25.988 --> 01:14:29.182
Rick, front door camera's out,
give it a look, yeah?


861
01:14:29.539 --> 01:14:31.448
Rick, are you there, bruv?

862
01:14:51.572 --> 01:14:52.517
Claire!

863
01:14:52.517 --> 01:14:56.025
I understand, mhmm,
I get it.


864
01:14:56.747 --> 01:14:58.837
I'll make it up to you.

865
01:14:59.818 --> 01:15:02.977
Mhmm...
I'll double our next fight.


866
01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:05.477
Mhmm.

867
01:15:06.715 --> 01:15:07.962
Yeah...

868
01:15:09.602 --> 01:15:11.160
Landon...

869
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.063
She's here.

870
01:15:21.397 --> 01:15:23.810
God dammit, Micah!
Find her!


871
01:15:38.979 --> 01:15:40.654
What happened?

872
01:15:41.081 --> 01:15:43.921
Landon, we need to leave.

873
01:15:43.946 --> 01:15:46.088
I don't think this is gonna end,
we need to leave now...


874
01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:47.384
No.

875
01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:49.906
No.

876
01:15:49.906 --> 01:15:52.722
Are you mental, bruv?
She's bashed a man's skull in!


877
01:15:52.722 --> 01:15:54.695
It's a fucking devil woman, bruv!

878
01:15:54.695 --> 01:15:58.323
- I don't want none of it!
- Not going anywhere!


879
01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:02.439
I built this place!

880
01:16:02.816 --> 01:16:04.728
I made you!

881
01:16:10.129 --> 01:16:16.612
I am not letting no majie
crow take down this nest!


882
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:24.199
You hear that?

883
01:16:28.839 --> 01:16:30.594
Claire...

884
01:16:31.093 --> 01:16:33.163
Sunshine...

885
01:16:37.557 --> 01:16:40.168
I want you to set her free.

886
01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:10.802
She's still breathing.

887
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.575
And what are you
gonna do about it, huh?

888
01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:16.320
Get her a Band
-Aid?

889
01:18:17.295 --> 01:18:21.169
Leave her and
kill that little bitch!


890
01:18:24.518 --> 01:18:27.000
Did I stutter?

891
01:18:30.202 --> 01:18:32.555
Get the fuck out of my face!

892
01:18:44.222 --> 01:18:47.100
May God hold you on
the palm of His hand...


893
01:18:56.579 --> 01:18:59.063
I don't care what you do here.

894
01:19:00.096 --> 01:19:02.410
I'm not like this...

895
01:19:03.293 --> 01:19:05.516
Never have been.

896
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:08.580
Don't underestimate him.

897
01:19:10.825 --> 01:19:13.005
Do it for Kate.

898
01:19:17.516 --> 01:19:18.858
Micah?

899
01:19:20.393 --> 01:19:22.508
♪ Micah... ♪

900
01:19:36.864 --> 01:19:42.757
All you had to do...
was do what you do best.


901
01:19:44.421 --> 01:19:49.031
But no...
you had to fuck me!


902
01:19:50.372 --> 01:19:53.069
Yeah, I'll go for you...

903
01:19:54.028 --> 01:19:56.863
But I'll tell you what's
gonna happen now.


904
01:19:57.199 --> 01:19:59.667
I'm gonna play a little game.

905
01:20:02.119 --> 01:20:05.917
I'm going to find
your little fucking niece...


906
01:20:06.248 --> 01:20:10.641
I'm gonna choke her
until she can't breathe anymore.


907
01:20:10.867 --> 01:20:15.432
And then I'm gonna find your father
and I'm gonna fucking kill him.


908
01:20:16.486 --> 01:20:19.440
This is the best deal
you're gonna get!


909
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:55.558
Do you think you're the
only monster here? Huh?


910
01:20:55.932 --> 01:20:57.068
Huh?

911
01:21:01.432 --> 01:21:03.439
Need some air?

912
01:21:35.454 --> 01:21:38.242
How sweet revenge, yes?

913
01:21:39.508 --> 01:21:42.039
This is not revenge.

914
01:21:44.081 --> 01:21:46.613
This is justice.

915
01:22:49.588 --> 01:22:52.768
I'm not gonna be able
to make this go away.


916
01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:55.221
You won't need to.

917
01:22:57.424 --> 01:23:00.398
You know they're all gonna come
after you for this.


918
01:23:01.335 --> 01:23:03.132
I know.

919
01:23:04.953 --> 01:23:07.018
Why, Becca?

920
01:23:10.243 --> 01:23:13.344
'Cos sometimes our true nature
isn't good enough.


921
01:23:17.004 --> 01:23:21.717
Sometimes people deserve more than
what the world does allow them to be.


922
01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:30.004
I MADE IT ACROSS

923
01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:39.808
Sometimes sacrifice
needs to be rewarded.


924
01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:51.995
I think I can buy you...

925
01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:54.314
a couple of days.

926
01:23:57.103 --> 01:23:58.834
That's it.

927
01:23:59.682 --> 01:24:01.552
That's enough.

928
01:24:12.330 --> 01:24:14.359
Where will you go?

929
01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.788
Hi!

930
01:24:51.582 --> 01:24:53.099
Hey!

931
01:24:55.286 --> 01:24:57.549
Out of all the places...

932
01:25:05.427 --> 01:25:08.707
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.


933
01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:17.052
So what do you think, Lily?
Hmm?


934
01:25:19.112 --> 01:25:20.304
I like it.

935
01:25:20.329 --> 01:25:21.638
Yeah...

936
01:25:21.638 --> 01:25:23.807
Of course you do.

937
01:25:39.724 --> 01:25:49.724
