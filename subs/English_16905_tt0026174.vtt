1
00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:39.633
Dr. Blood!

2
00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.010
Who is it?

3
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.178
That we'll know better
when you've opened the door.


4
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.615
Me?

5
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.716
My mistake. After I've opened the door.

6
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.885
Open it, quick!

7
00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:00.694
Why, Jeremy Pitt, isn't it?

8
00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:04.563
It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded
at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river.


9
00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:07.192
- The rash fool.
- He sent me for you. No time to lose.


10
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.364
Why, to be sure, I'll lose none,
nor my head either.


11
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.499
Come in and regain yours
while I get my things.


12
00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:14.566
- I'll wait here.
- As you please.


13
00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:16.737
Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress.

14
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.145
Jeremy, how was the battle?

15
00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:24.311
Battle? Slaughter, rather!

16
00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:26.412
What can clubs do against cannon?

17
00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.256
In case this business keeps me overlong,
take care you water my geraniums...


18
00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:33.352
especially those
under the bedroom window.


19
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.363
Geraniums. Won't you ever grow up?

20
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.229
One would think you were still
at medical school.


21
00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.035
Geraniums!

22
00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:41.934
You would think of geraniums...

23
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.565
when every other able-bodied man
is out fighting.


24
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.939
It's out of favor I seem to be with you,
my vinegary virgin.


25
00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:50.769
- Half the town is saying you're a papist.
- Why?


26
00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:54.339
Because I have the sense to sleep tonight
instead of rushing to my ruin...


27
00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:57.011
in an attempt to put
this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?


28
00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:58.883
He'd be even worse than King James.

29
00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:01.287
Make haste with that cloak there,
my pretty one.


30
00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:03.552
And the other half of the town
that defends you...


31
00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.992
claims that you're just a coward.

32
00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.630
Mrs. Barlow, my darling,
you can tell them, if you like...


33
00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.497
that I've been most anywhere
that fighting was in evidence.


34
00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:16.402
Fought for the French against the Spanish,
and the Spanish against the French...


35
00:04:16.472 --> 00:04:19.134
and I learned my seamanship
in the Dutch Navy.


36
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.270
But having had adventure enough
in six years to last me six lives...


37
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.907
I came here, hung up the sword,
and picked up the lancet.


38
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.510
Became a man of peace and not of war.
A healer, not a slayer...


39
00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:35.546
and that I am going to be as long as
I'm on top of the sod and not under it.


40
00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:46.560
- Will you be back for breakfast?
- Who knows, my pretty one?


41
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.642
The worst is done, my friend.
Give your mind peace.


42
00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:26.939
The King's men!

43
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:31.547
There's nothing to fear.
This is a Christian country.


44
00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:34.549
Christian men don't make war
on the wounded...


45
00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:36.346
or those who shelter them.

46
00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:46.423
I'm Capt. Hobart of Col. 
Kirke's dragoons.

47
00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:48.123
What rebels do you harbor?

48
00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:51.360
No rebels. This wounded gentleman...

49
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.334
No need to ask
how he came by his wounds.


50
00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:55.370
A rebel. Out with him.

51
00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.076
This man can't be moved
without peril to his life.


52
00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:04.636
Who the devil may you be?

53
00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:07.043
Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.

54
00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:08.743
Don't fling your French at me.

55
00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:10.979
Latin, my dull friend.
It means I'm a doctor.


56
00:06:11.053 --> 00:06:12.748
Or a liar.

57
00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:16.724
If your wit were as big as your voice,
it's the great man you'd be for this.


58
00:06:16.792 --> 00:06:19.522
You may find me great enough
to hang you!


59
00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:22.296
Yes, I don't doubt it.

60
00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:25.095
You've the looks and manners
of a hangman.


61
00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:27.295
Take him away, and the others, too!

62
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.470
"ln the name of His Majesty,
Our Sovereign Lord...


63
00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:05.132
"prisoners of the Crown,
you stand indicted...


64
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.328
"for having maliciously
and traitorously conspired...


65
00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:11.107
"to change, alter, and wholly to subvert
the ancient government...


66
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.239
"of this Kingdom of England.

67
00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:15.614

69

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.058

73

Baron Jeffreys of Wem...


79
00:07:50.886 --> 00:07:54.686
"and by a jury of
12 good men and true."

80
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.023
James Haynsworth, hold up your hand.

81
00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:03.796
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.


82
00:08:03.866 --> 00:08:07.495
- Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.


83
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.064
- Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.


84
00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:16.577
- Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.


85
00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:21.583
- John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.


86
00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:25.744
Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty?

87
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:27.914
Guilty. Praise the Lord.

88
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.790
Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty?

89
00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:33.495
Guilty.

90
00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:38.522
- Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.


91
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:42.667
Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty?

92
00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:45.104
It's entirely innocent, I am.

93
00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:48.937
Take the stand and face His Lordship.

94
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:55.182
Are you guilty or not guilty?
You must use the right words.


95
00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:59.050
Words, is it? Not guilty.

96
00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:03.419
And speaking of words, I'd like to
say a few about the injustice...


97
00:09:03.492 --> 00:09:06.393
of keeping an innocent man
locked up for three months...


98
00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:11.058
in such filth and heat and ill-feeding
that my chief regret is I didn't try...


99
00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.727
to pull down the filthy fellow
that sits on the throne.


100
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.100
Silence!

101
00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:18.800
Are you entirely ignorant
of the proper procedure of the court?


102
00:09:18.874 --> 00:09:20.842
Most happily ignorant up to now.

103
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.208
I could gladly have done
without this acquaintance.


104
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.144
Enough of this.

105
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.681
There is nothing more to be said,
except the passing of sentence.


106
00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:32.811
May it please Your Lordship,
but there's a deal more to be said!


107
00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:34.378
Silence!

108
00:09:34.457 --> 00:09:38.188
- How now, fellow?
- There is the little matter of my defense.


109
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.490
Very well, then...

110
00:09:40.863 --> 00:09:43.423
but in heaven's name, be brief, man.

111
00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:45.662
We have much to do.

112
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.429
I am guilty of nothing, my lord...

113
00:09:49.638 --> 00:09:52.573
unless it be adjudged a crime
that a man try to live peaceably.


114
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:55.371
Living peaceably
with the army of Monmouth?


115
00:09:55.478 --> 00:09:57.639
I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord.

116
00:09:57.713 --> 00:10:00.443
I was arrested while engaging
in my profession as physician.


117
00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:04.145
What's this?
You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?


118
00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:07.487
And as such was summoned
to the aid of Lord Gildoy...


119
00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:10.719
by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify.

120
00:10:10.793 --> 00:10:13.728
Master Pitt will testify.

121
00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:16.230
He that is himself a confessed traitor.

122
00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:19.829
- Ls that your witness?
- There is also Andrew Baynes.


123
00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:22.769
Master Baynes
will have enough testifying...


124
00:10:22.838 --> 00:10:26.171
in a useless effort
to keep his own neck from the halter.


125
00:10:26.242 --> 00:10:29.109
I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater,
the town where I live.


126
00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:31.271
We've no time for all this.

127
00:10:32.348 --> 00:10:34.612
If these other traitors
are as stubborn as you...


128
00:10:34.683 --> 00:10:37.311
I may sit here till the next assizes.

129
00:10:38.287 --> 00:10:39.686
Very well, then.

130
00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:42.588
There's a witness I'll give you
that you can't deny:


131
00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:44.216
yourself, sir.

132
00:10:44.293 --> 00:10:48.127
For if I'm not physician,
how is it I know that you're a dying man?


133
00:10:53.536 --> 00:10:56.937
The death to which you're dooming
hundreds of poor men daily...


134
00:10:57.006 --> 00:11:01.102
in a frantic effort to send their souls
to perdition before your own...


135
00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.077
is a light pleasantry...

136
00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:05.375
compared to the bleeding death
in the lungs...


137
00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:08.144
to which the great Judge
has condemned you.


138
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.277
Now, fellow,
we'll be done with the witnesses...


139
00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:15.585
and I will convict you
out of your own rascally mouth.


140
00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:20.720
When this Pitt came to summon you,
as you claim...


141
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.663
did you know you were called
to attend another rebel?


142
00:11:23.732 --> 00:11:26.428
My business was with his wounds,
not his politics.


143
00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:28.402
Did you know the law...

144
00:11:28.537 --> 00:11:32.337
that any person who does
knowingly receive, harbor, comfort...


145
00:11:32.408 --> 00:11:37.311
or succor a rebel
is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?


146
00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:40.212
I only knew my
sacred duty as a physician.

147
00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:44.249
Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!

148
00:11:48.557 --> 00:11:51.025
I thought it was to my fellow man.

149
00:11:57.666 --> 00:12:01.397
It's a fearful thing
to send a man's soul to perdition...


150
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:04.739
but I am bound by my conscience...

151
00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:08.140
and my love of my
king to deal out justice.

152
00:12:14.617 --> 00:12:18.075
Therefore, I instruct you,
gentlemen of the jury...


153
00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:21.717
that inasmuch as Peter Blood
has admitted...


154
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.224
aiding a traitor to your king...

155
00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:27.091
you do bring in a verdict of guilty...

156
00:12:27.162 --> 00:12:29.357
that he may be hanged...

157
00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:32.093
for the high treason he has committed.

158
00:12:38.173 --> 00:12:41.165
What a creature must sit on the throne...

159
00:12:41.243 --> 00:12:44.235
who lets a man like you
deal out his justice.


160
00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:53.487
- Your Majesty.
- Sunderland, what brings you here?


161
00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:55.456
These numerous hangings.

162
00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.925
Splendid, aren't they?
We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.


163
00:12:58.994 --> 00:13:00.621
Very true, Your Majesty...

164
00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:03.028
but a foolish waste
of valuable human flesh.


165
00:13:03.098 --> 00:13:04.122
How so?

166
00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:09.027
Your Majesty's colonies in the West Indies
are urgently in need of slaves.


167
00:13:09.338 --> 00:13:14.071
A healthy, vigorous man
can be reckoned worth from £10 to £20.


168
00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:16.634
Splendid, Sunderland.

169
00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:20.908
Send out word immediately that the King
is graciously pleased to command...


170
00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:24.043
that all rebels convicted
but not yet hanged...


171
00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:25.450
be gathered together...

172
00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:29.082
and shipped by the first available boats
to the Americas.


173
00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:57.850
Give us water!
There are men dying down here.


174
00:14:15.804 --> 00:14:19.535
You'd think they'd take better care
of a valuable cargo like us.


175
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:42.154
Ahoy, the deck! Land sighted, Port Royal!

176
00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:54.834
It's a truly royal clemency we're granted,
my friends...


177
00:14:55.277 --> 00:14:58.075
one well worthy of King James.

178
00:14:59.581 --> 00:15:04.211
He spares us the mercifully quick
extinction of the hangman's rope...


179
00:15:04.319 --> 00:15:06.583
and gives the slow death of slavery.

180
00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:11.383
He grants us our lives
in exchange for a living death.


181
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.158
It's an uncertain world entirely.

182
00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:36.580
"Be it known, men, that these prisoners
who stand before you...


183
00:15:36.652 --> 00:15:39.485
"are now to be sold at a right
and fitting price.


184
00:15:39.555 --> 00:15:42.023
"They may be put to labor
in the sulfur mines...


185
00:15:42.091 --> 00:15:44.491
"or on the plantations
for a period of 10 years.


186
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.494
"And the parties
to whom they are assigned...


187
00:15:46.562 --> 00:15:48.928
"must enter into security
for the proper punishment...


188
00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:50.021
"of their offense."

189
00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:51.999
His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal.

190
00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:55.093
Guards, attention! 
Present muskets.

191
00:15:55.471 --> 00:15:58.804
Good day, Captain. Lovely day, isn't it?
Or is it?


192
00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:02.670
- Good day, Dixon.
- Good day, Governor.


193
00:16:02.745 --> 00:16:05.612
I suppose we can begin this sale now,
Governor.


194
00:16:05.681 --> 00:16:07.615
No, better wait for Col. Bishop.

195
00:16:07.683 --> 00:16:10.652
He has the privilege
of being late for everything.


196
00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:12.482
Yes, I know.

197
00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:13.953
There he is.

198
00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:28.931
- Good afternoon, Col. Bishop.
- Good afternoon, Governor.


199
00:16:29.004 --> 00:16:30.494
Good afternoon, 
Miss Arabella.

200
00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:32.597
How is my darling, the Governor,
and his foot?


201
00:16:32.674 --> 00:16:35.370
Every day I think my gout
can't get any worse...


202
00:16:35.444 --> 00:16:37.469
and every day it does.

203
00:16:37.613 --> 00:16:40.707
My dear Colonel,
according to the King's request...


204
00:16:40.783 --> 00:16:44.549
it is for you to take first choice
of this dainty nosegay...


205
00:16:45.888 --> 00:16:48.118
and at your own price.

206
00:16:48.557 --> 00:16:50.457
Egad, they're an appalling lot...

207
00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:52.687
not likely to be of much value
on the plantation.


208
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.490
The less you want, the more for Dixon.

209
00:16:54.563 --> 00:16:57.498
- Dixon? Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all.
- Buy them all?


210
00:16:57.566 --> 00:16:59.363
To keep them out of Dixon's hands.

211
00:16:59.434 --> 00:17:02.426
I perceive somebody's been talking
behind my back...


212
00:17:02.504 --> 00:17:03.937
telling the truth.

213
00:17:04.006 --> 00:17:06.998
- And you can joke.
- Arabella dear, don't be childish.


214
00:17:07.075 --> 00:17:09.373
These men are rebels against their king.

215
00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:11.344
They should be hanged, drawn,
and quartered.


216
00:17:11.413 --> 00:17:14.314
- Any fate they meet is too good for them.
- Your uncle is right.


217
00:17:14.383 --> 00:17:16.874
- Let the sale commence.
- My foot!


218
00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:20.888
My dear, the law is the law,
and it's His Majesty's law...


219
00:17:20.989 --> 00:17:22.718
and must be obeyed.

220
00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:26.089
The best of the lot.

221
00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:29.330
Open your mouth.

222
00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:34.568
- £20.
- Sold!


223
00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:37.104
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

224
00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:43.542
- As if he were buying horses.
- Yes, quite.


225
00:17:54.223 --> 00:17:57.750
- Same price.
- This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot...


226
00:17:57.826 --> 00:17:59.487
young and sturdy.

227
00:18:03.732 --> 00:18:04.960
- Same price.
- Sold!


228
00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:07.194
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

229
00:18:17.246 --> 00:18:18.372
Quiet!

230
00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:22.914
Open your mouth.

231
00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:44.137
His pride has bought him a ticket
to Dixon's mines.


232
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.303
He isn't there yet.

233
00:18:48.944 --> 00:18:52.311
- My dear, consider your social position!
- Uncle!


234
00:18:58.353 --> 00:19:00.287
- Which one?
- That one.


235
00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:03.515
- Him? I will not.
- But I want you to.


236
00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:07.187
No. Let him cool his head
in Dixon's mines. I'll have none of him.


237
00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:13.291
- £5.
- £5? That's an insulting sum to offer.


238
00:19:13.368 --> 00:19:16.804
- Does anyone offer more?
- £6.


239
00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:21.599
£7.

240
00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:23.542
You're making an exhibition of yourself...

241
00:19:23.612 --> 00:19:26.308
a girl like you,
bidding for a slave before these people.


242
00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:27.781
- Will you buy him?
- Certainly not.


243
00:19:27.849 --> 00:19:29.009
£8.

244
00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.356
When a lady's interested in a man....

245
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:37.915
Calm down, Dixon,
£8 is nothing for such a man...


246
00:19:38.193 --> 00:19:41.287
a skilled physician,
a gentleman, and a scholar.


247
00:19:41.897 --> 00:19:45.196
- All right, £9.
- £10!


248
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.570
It's apparent Miss Bishop wants him
more than I do.


249
00:19:49.638 --> 00:19:51.902
Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for £10.

250
00:19:55.077 --> 00:19:56.203
Sold!

251
00:19:57.212 --> 00:19:58.577
£10, sold.

252
00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:02.108
What would you like done with him,
Miss Bishop?


253
00:20:02.184 --> 00:20:04.846
Why, I don't know.

254
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.617
You're extremely foolish.
It might have cost you your life.


255
00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:14.762
It was fortunate for you
that I was here to save you.


256
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:19.196
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought
by anyone by the name of Bishop.


257
00:20:20.268 --> 00:20:22.429
You could learn a lesson in gratitude.

258
00:20:22.537 --> 00:20:24.664
I could thank for not interfering.

259
00:20:25.007 --> 00:20:28.841
As it happens, you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.


260
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.140
You may join the others belonging
to my uncle...


261
00:20:31.213 --> 00:20:34.376
and henceforth you may take your orders
from him.


262
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:38.442
Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop.

263
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.173
Come on. Move on, there.

264
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.870
Last night, this dog attempted to escape.

265
00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:05.938
Today you'll see what happens
to those who forget...


266
00:22:06.007 --> 00:22:09.306
that my friend King James
did you all a favor...


267
00:22:09.377 --> 00:22:12.175
in saving you from your just fate
on the gallows.


268
00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:14.238
Show them the iron, Kent.

269
00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:24.520
F
-T.

270
00:22:25.861 --> 00:22:28.853
Whoever wears that brand
is known as a fugitive traitor...


271
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.727
and will be treated as such.

272
00:22:31.233 --> 00:22:33.394
Burn those letters in your brain...

273
00:22:33.869 --> 00:22:36.235
lest they be burned on your hides, too.

274
00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:41.238
There speaks a fit friend for King James
if ever I heard one.


275
00:22:42.177 --> 00:22:45.874
Would I had him and his friend James
roasting on a spit over that fire.


276
00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:51.184
Great would be the burning thereof
and loud the rejoicing in Heaven.


277
00:22:52.554 --> 00:22:54.021
Do your duty!

278
00:23:07.736 --> 00:23:12.070
What a cruel shame
that any man is made to suffer so.


279
00:23:13.942 --> 00:23:18.106
- This beastly gout!
- Perhaps a new dressing will help.


280
00:23:18.213 --> 00:23:19.213
Perhaps.

281
00:23:19.281 --> 00:23:21.010
- I have it here.
- Put it down.


282
00:23:21.082 --> 00:23:22.413
So sorry, Doctor.

283
00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:24.349
Easy, you clumsy louts!

284
00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:27.911
- We won't hurt you, Governor.
- You thick-fingered jackasses!


285
00:23:28.356 --> 00:23:30.256
His Excellency will have his little joke.

286
00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:32.589
Lll-begotten bunglers!

287
00:23:32.661 --> 00:23:35.186
- Blundering pill peddlers!
- Your Excellency...


288
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.821
That is the final straw.

289
00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:43.130
Out of this house...

290
00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:45.298
and never let me see your faces again.

291
00:23:45.373 --> 00:23:47.807
- But think of our reputations.
- Hang your reputations!


292
00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:50.367
Leave me! I don't
want to see you again!

293
00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:52.640
Away! Out!

294
00:23:52.714 --> 00:23:55.080
I don't want to see you!
Out into the streets!


295
00:23:56.218 --> 00:23:59.210
Stop shouting.
You brought on my headache again.


296
00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:01.551
Good! Hannibal, come take my crutch.

297
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.657
Easy, now. Help me up with my foot.

298
00:24:04.726 --> 00:24:06.489
No remedy. Why, thank you, dear.

299
00:24:12.267 --> 00:24:14.599
Why doesn't His Excellency
try another doctor?


300
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:15.863
Another doctor?

301
00:24:15.937 --> 00:24:18.337
There are only those two
on this wretched island...


302
00:24:18.406 --> 00:24:21.136
- and each one is worse than his partner.
- There is another.


303
00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:24.576
And according to what I've heard,
he became a slave by being a doctor.


304
00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:26.045
A slave?

305
00:24:26.114 --> 00:24:29.811
Would you elevate a slave
to the position of doctor to the Governor?


306
00:24:30.986 --> 00:24:33.648
- Ls he a good doctor?
- I don't know.


307
00:24:38.526 --> 00:24:40.050
Why are you laughing?

308
00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:43.364
I'm just thinking how annoyed
Peter Blood would be...


309
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:45.365
if I did him another favor.

310
00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:51.637
Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens
of this sovereign island...


311
00:24:51.706 --> 00:24:53.640
who come before you with complaints.

312
00:24:53.708 --> 00:24:55.699
Complaints, complaints.

313
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:59.547
Can none of my citizens
follow the example of their governor...


314
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:03.046
who endures the utmost agony
without a murmur?


315
00:25:04.686 --> 00:25:07.348
- Easy there, fellow.
- Did I hurt you, sir?


316
00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:10.050
No, but I thought you were going to.

317
00:25:10.892 --> 00:25:13.986
Your Excellency,
this vagrant hides his sins...


318
00:25:14.062 --> 00:25:16.155
behind the name of Honesty Nuttall.

319
00:25:16.231 --> 00:25:20.167
- He's charged with being in debt.
- State your case, fellow, and no lies.


320
00:25:20.235 --> 00:25:22.567
I was on the way to pay the butcher
on Tuesday...


321
00:25:22.637 --> 00:25:26.368
as Honesty Nuttall is my name,
when I chanced on a poor old beggar.


322
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:27.931
It was Jones from the grog shop...

323
00:25:28.009 --> 00:25:30.068
who begged me to
have a drink with him.

324
00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:32.136
Try standing on it, Your Honor.

325
00:25:32.914 --> 00:25:36.213
Stand on that bundle of pain? Impossible.

326
00:25:36.484 --> 00:25:40.113
I remembered in time my poor
starving wife in need of the five bob.


327
00:25:40.188 --> 00:25:43.954
What is this all about? Silence!

328
00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:46.784
- Sit down.
- What's he here for?


329
00:25:46.861 --> 00:25:49.261
For debt, Your Excellency,
and the prevaricator...


330
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:52.926
If it's for debt,
don't annoy me with such petty things.


331
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:54.901
Order him to work it off.

332
00:25:54.969 --> 00:25:58.132
Work? Not that, anything but work.

333
00:25:58.206 --> 00:25:59.503
What's your trade?

334
00:25:59.574 --> 00:26:02.873
I'm a ship's carpenter
when the painful necessity arises.


335
00:26:03.078 --> 00:26:04.409
Take him to work on the docks...

336
00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:07.346
and don't you attempt to escape
till every farthing's paid...


337
00:26:07.415 --> 00:26:09.406
or I'll stretch your hide on the rack!

338
00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:11.884
Escape? How could a debtor escape
from this island...


339
00:26:11.953 --> 00:26:14.319
even if he had a
boat to do it with?

340
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:17.358
I couldn't escape any more
than a slave could escape.


341
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.558
I can walk.

342
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.559
Wonderful, my dear fellow.

343
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:26.600
Only two months' treatment,
and I'm a well man.


344
00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:28.226
It's a miracle.

345
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.099
- The next complaint...
- Drat the next complaint. I can walk.


346
00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:33.697
Come, Doctor.

347
00:26:33.775 --> 00:26:36.938
You'll get your reward for this,
Peter Blood.


348
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:40.811
- From now on, you're my physician.
- Your Excellency is too kind.


349
00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:44.045
Come back early tomorrow.
You're always welcome, Dr. Blood.


350
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.541
Hello.

351
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:22.113
Don't I know you?

352
00:27:22.824 --> 00:27:25.019
A lady should know her own property.

353
00:27:25.527 --> 00:27:28.792
- My property?
- Let me refresh your memory.


354
00:27:28.997 --> 00:27:32.296
My name is Peter Blood,
and I'm worth precisely £10.


355
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:36.798
Forgive me for not recognizing you,
Dr. Blood.


356
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:38.634
You're so changed...

357
00:27:39.174 --> 00:27:40.334
for the better.

358
00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:43.673
The Governor tells me
I have you to thank for that.


359
00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:46.009
You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.

360
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.274
Do you think I'd be
grateful for an easy life


361
00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:50.302
when my friends are
treated like animals?


362
00:27:50.351 --> 00:27:53.912
It's they deserve your favors, not I.
They're all honest rebels.


363
00:27:53.988 --> 00:27:57.048
I was snoring in my bed
while they were trying to free England...


364
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.752
from an unclean tyrant.

365
00:27:58.893 --> 00:28:01.123
I believe you're talking treason.

366
00:28:01.362 --> 00:28:03.227
I hope I'm not obscure.

367
00:28:03.298 --> 00:28:05.459
- You could be flogged for that.
- No.


368
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:09.168
The Governor would never allow it.
He has the gout.


369
00:28:09.337 --> 00:28:10.861
You depend upon that?

370
00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:15.100
I intend to, for all it's worth,
and that promises to be considerable.


371
00:28:17.512 --> 00:28:21.278
But you'd hardly know about that.
You've probably never had the gout.


372
00:28:24.586 --> 00:28:27.214
- Good afternoon, Miss Bishop.
- Good afternoon.


373
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:02.679
15-2, 15-4, and a pair are six.

374
00:29:03.358 --> 00:29:05.451
- Another?
- What else is there to do...


375
00:29:05.527 --> 00:29:08.792
ever since you ruined the Governor's foot
and our reputations with it?


376
00:29:08.863 --> 00:29:12.526
- I ruined the Governor's foot?
- I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are...


377
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.329
- Someone coming.
- A patient?


378
00:29:14.402 --> 00:29:15.596
A patient!

379
00:29:18.907 --> 00:29:21.808
- I beg your pardon, Doctor. I'm so sorry.
- Lt's all right.


380
00:29:26.447 --> 00:29:27.846
Come in.

381
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.417
Good afternoon, colleagues. Dr. Bronson.

382
00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:36.485
- Dr. Whacker.
- Good afternoon.


383
00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:38.956
How's business, my friends?

384
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:40.051
- Terrible.
- Good.


385
00:29:40.128 --> 00:29:42.596
- Terribly good.
- That relieves me.


386
00:29:42.764 --> 00:29:45.130
I had heard that things
were not altogether....


387
00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:47.701
ldle gossip, obviously.

388
00:29:48.469 --> 00:29:50.232
You intend to remain here?

389
00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:54.170
Remain here? Why not?

390
00:29:55.977 --> 00:29:57.444
It's queer.

391
00:29:57.612 --> 00:30:01.378
There are you, free to come and go as
you please, and you choose to stay here.


392
00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:03.944
While I, who hate this
pestilential island....


393
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.933
Such are the quirks
of circumstance.


394
00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:09.212
I must be running along, gentlemen.

395
00:30:09.824 --> 00:30:11.621
Good day, gentlemen.

396
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:17.392
It's pleasant to see
everything so prosperous with you here.


397
00:30:18.499 --> 00:30:20.364
- Not so hasty.
- Just a moment.


398
00:30:20.435 --> 00:30:23.199
There's something I'd like to ask you.

399
00:30:23.371 --> 00:30:24.895
Well, gentlemen?

400
00:30:25.006 --> 00:30:27.634
Have you been thinking of leaving us,
Doctor?


401
00:30:27.842 --> 00:30:31.243
Leaving? Now, Doctor.

402
00:30:31.546 --> 00:30:33.480
How could a slave think of leaving?

403
00:30:33.548 --> 00:30:38.008
Or even if he were fool enough to try,
by what means could he hope to escape?


404
00:30:38.252 --> 00:30:41.551
And where, for example,
could he raise the few pounds necessary...


405
00:30:41.623 --> 00:30:44.285
to purchase even a small boat?

406
00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:47.419
- We might supply it.
- You?


407
00:30:48.062 --> 00:30:51.759
- Now, gentlemen.
- Now, let's talk this thing over.


408
00:30:52.266 --> 00:30:55.167
Now, if you'll just sit down here.

409
00:30:55.303 --> 00:30:58.067
Now then, how much will you need?

410
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.905
£20 might buy a small wherry,
£10 more might equip it.


411
00:31:01.976 --> 00:31:03.443
He's right.

412
00:31:03.578 --> 00:31:06.342
- He means...
- You needn't tell me what he means.


413
00:31:06.414 --> 00:31:09.508
I know two Christian gentlemen
when I see them.


414
00:31:09.984 --> 00:31:14.148
Two men whose hearts are bleeding
for a brother doctor in distress.


415
00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:19.252
But it's too much to ask,
too noble a gesture to hope for.


416
00:31:19.327 --> 00:31:21.852
No, my good man, not at all.

417
00:31:21.996 --> 00:31:23.588
But who would buy the boat?

418
00:31:23.665 --> 00:31:27.157
We would not dare,
and you, a slave, you could not.


419
00:31:27.268 --> 00:31:28.268
True.

420
00:31:28.603 --> 00:31:32.937
That would be my part. To find someone.
A man as eager to escape as I.


421
00:31:33.508 --> 00:31:36.944
- A man held here for debt, say.
- Then it's a bargain?


422
00:31:38.012 --> 00:31:41.880
Gentlemen,
you've opened for me the gates of hope.


423
00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:44.985
Doctor.

424
00:31:50.124 --> 00:31:52.388
- My dear colleague.
- Gentlemen.


425
00:31:57.565 --> 00:31:58.759
Now we have him.

426
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.859
We've only to get him involved
and reveal his plan.


427
00:32:01.936 --> 00:32:05.201
He'll steal very little of our business
when he's in irons.


428
00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:08.073
Gentlemen.

429
00:32:10.144 --> 00:32:13.341
There's one thing slipped
my mind entirely.


430
00:32:14.215 --> 00:32:18.208
Simple-minded men might think this
an opportunity for trickery...


431
00:32:18.453 --> 00:32:22.389
but brilliant men like yourselves
will remember in what favor I stand...


432
00:32:22.457 --> 00:32:25.426
with the Governor
in contrast to some others...


433
00:32:25.493 --> 00:32:28.792
and how little their words
would weigh against mine.


434
00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:31.957
Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot!

435
00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:33.694
Good day, gentlemen.

436
00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:08.560
- Are you all with me?
- Yes.


437
00:33:08.636 --> 00:33:09.694
Listen.

438
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:12.968
There's a man named Nuttall
who's in trouble with the Governor.


439
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.634
He's looking for a small boat
which he'll purchase...


440
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.177
on the night chosen for our escape.

441
00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:18.803
- Escape?
- Quiet!


442
00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:24.681
While he gathers stores and equipment,
we must be ready on the inside.


443
00:33:24.886 --> 00:33:28.652
We might steal some sugarcane knives
and hack through the stockade walls.


444
00:33:28.723 --> 00:33:30.190
Or dig our way under.

445
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:34.251
Once at sea, if we get there,
our troubles will have just begun.


446
00:33:34.328 --> 00:33:36.387
If any of you want to withdraw,
now's the time.


447
00:33:36.464 --> 00:33:37.897
- No.
- Not me.


448
00:33:38.432 --> 00:33:41.868
You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match
your hearts against any other.


449
00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:45.099
We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt.
He was a ship's pilot.


450
00:33:45.173 --> 00:33:49.109
Here's one you won't have to teach.
Six years in King James' Navy.


451
00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.340
- What?
- That's nothing. I was a blooming gunner.


452
00:33:53.447 --> 00:33:55.938
- A gunner?
- Ln the King's Navy, too.


453
00:33:56.017 --> 00:33:58.076
I was always ashamed
of it up to now.

454
00:33:58.419 --> 00:34:00.046
We'll have a crew yet!

455
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:03.090
Any of you others
been keeping such secrets?


456
00:34:04.158 --> 00:34:05.716
Where's Baynes?

457
00:34:06.427 --> 00:34:09.794
- Where is he?
- He tried to escape today.


458
00:34:09.964 --> 00:34:12.125
No! Caught?

459
00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:15.602
- Branded?
- Yeah.


460
00:34:29.016 --> 00:34:30.506
No!

461
00:34:34.789 --> 00:34:36.814
Why did you do it, Andy?

462
00:34:37.024 --> 00:34:39.424
I told you I'd
try to get you out.

463
00:34:39.493 --> 00:34:42.758
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I couldn't stand it.


464
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.561
I was going mad.
What do you think a man is made of?


465
00:34:46.634 --> 00:34:48.795
How much do you think he can stand?

466
00:34:55.977 --> 00:35:00.346
"Watchman, what of the night?"
lsaiah 21:1 1.


467
00:35:21.435 --> 00:35:23.801
Don't make the purchase
until well on in the evening.


468
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:25.429
That way there'll be less risk...

469
00:35:25.506 --> 00:35:27.633
of anyone wondering where you came by
the money.


470
00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:31.166
Lumme, Captain. lt ain't too
late for us to change our minds.


471
00:35:31.245 --> 00:35:33.736
Stow the provisions away on board
as soon as it's dark.


472
00:35:33.814 --> 00:35:36.612
Then all you've got to do is sit down here
and wait for us.


473
00:35:36.684 --> 00:35:39.278
Is that all?
Wait all alone in the blooming dark...


474
00:35:39.353 --> 00:35:41.913
waiting for someone to come along
and nab me.


475
00:35:42.189 --> 00:35:45.488
Nuttall, my lad,
there's just one other little thing.


476
00:35:45.559 --> 00:35:50.121
Could you find me a good piece of timber
about so thick and so long?


477
00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:51.423
Yes, I think so.

478
00:35:51.499 --> 00:35:54.195
Then do so and lash it to your spine.
It needs stiffening.


479
00:35:54.268 --> 00:35:56.202
Courage. I'll join you at midnight.

480
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:12.010
How long does it take to feed
this pack of dogs?


481
00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:15.487
It's a wonder we make a profit at all.
You don't drive them hard enough.


482
00:36:15.556 --> 00:36:17.387
Get them out of here!

483
00:36:29.603 --> 00:36:33.061
I've just been with Nuttall at the boat.
It's tonight.


484
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.334
- At last!
- For heaven's sake, command yourself.


485
00:36:37.478 --> 00:36:40.140
- Tonight, Hagthorpe.
- Caution above everything.


486
00:36:40.214 --> 00:36:42.705
He who goes slowly, goes safely.

487
00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:47.952
Remember, Jeremy,
you're the only navigator among us.


488
00:36:48.022 --> 00:36:50.320
Without you, there's no escape.

489
00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:56.219
Hello, Uncle!

490
00:36:56.297 --> 00:37:00.028
Riding again? What do you plan to see
riding always the same road?


491
00:37:00.101 --> 00:37:03.969
You'd be surprised what interesting things
there are to see on this island...


492
00:37:04.038 --> 00:37:05.596
if you only keep your eyes open.

493
00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:09.905
Today, for instance, I saw something
that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know.


494
00:37:12.113 --> 00:37:15.378
Stores and equipment
are all stowed away onboard.


495
00:37:17.752 --> 00:37:19.947
We could use more food,
but there's no money left.


496
00:37:20.021 --> 00:37:23.616
I'm not taking any chances
by asking our medical friends for more.


497
00:37:24.025 --> 00:37:26.459
I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat
by midnight.


498
00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:30.453
Jeremy, we must not fail tonight.

499
00:37:30.531 --> 00:37:33.694
What the devil have you been up to?

500
00:37:33.768 --> 00:37:36.931
Tonight will be a fine night,
judging by the sky.


501
00:37:37.571 --> 00:37:41.405
There you are, Pitt. Keep it covered up
and it should heal in a day or so.


502
00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:46.472
Miss Bishop. You looking for me, sir?

503
00:37:46.547 --> 00:37:48.845
Yes. You, stop!

504
00:37:50.684 --> 00:37:53.448
What's the matter? 
Why are you shaking?

505
00:37:54.221 --> 00:37:56.212
Nothing. l....

506
00:37:59.627 --> 00:38:01.959
What's going on between you two?

507
00:38:02.863 --> 00:38:05.423
Why, nothing. The man has a bad leg.

508
00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:11.628
I'll tend to you later.
Where have you been?


509
00:38:12.306 --> 00:38:14.399
I've been at my work,
attending to the Governor.


510
00:38:14.475 --> 00:38:15.737
You lie.

511
00:38:16.077 --> 00:38:17.101
Do I?

512
00:38:17.178 --> 00:38:19.009
The Governor's had another attack of gout.

513
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.641
He's been screaming for you
like a wounded horse all the afternoon.


514
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.741
Then it appears
I was not with the Governor.


515
00:38:24.819 --> 00:38:26.650
Then where have you been?

516
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.883
- Why, I've been at....
- He was with me, Uncle.


517
00:38:29.957 --> 00:38:30.957
What?

518
00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:34.893
Thank you for protecting my reputation,
Dr. Blood, but it was a useless gallantry.


519
00:38:34.962 --> 00:38:37.692
My uncle knows that I spend my time
with whomever I please.


520
00:38:37.765 --> 00:38:40.666
You might choose your company
with better taste.


521
00:38:40.768 --> 00:38:43.862
His Excellency's waiting for you!
Here, Kent, lend him your horse.


522
00:38:43.938 --> 00:38:45.064
Yes, sir.

523
00:38:45.606 --> 00:38:48.336
Otherwise, the lout will be all night
getting there.


524
00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:50.206
Will I be required there long, sir?

525
00:38:50.277 --> 00:38:53.303
You're afraid your work will interfere
with your social affairs?


526
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.248
If I get back late, before midnight,
could I get back into the stockade?


527
00:38:57.318 --> 00:39:00.412
Will you stay here talking all night?
Be off with you!


528
00:39:07.027 --> 00:39:09.018
Take him to the stockade!

529
00:39:09.463 --> 00:39:11.260
Go on, get along in there.

530
00:39:19.073 --> 00:39:20.768
If he talks, we're lost.

531
00:39:33.387 --> 00:39:34.547
Well?

532
00:39:36.157 --> 00:39:38.921
It seems that you're continually
doing me favors.


533
00:39:38.993 --> 00:39:41.120
- I don't know why.
- Neither do I.


534
00:39:41.195 --> 00:39:42.321
Yes, I do.

535
00:39:42.396 --> 00:39:45.797
It's because you're so very grateful
and always thank me so prettily.


536
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.126
Sure now, you don't blame me
for resenting you and your favors.


537
00:39:49.203 --> 00:39:53.071
This is interesting. I've had men tell me
they had reasons for admiring me...


538
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.836
and some have even laid claims
to reasons for loving me...


539
00:39:55.910 --> 00:40:00.313
but for a man to store up reasons
for resenting me, how refreshing.


540
00:40:00.814 --> 00:40:02.406
You must tell me a few of them.

541
00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:04.974
The first is reason enough.
You bought me.


542
00:40:05.986 --> 00:40:10.389
I've had no lack of experiences in my time,
but to be bought and sold was a new one.


543
00:40:10.457 --> 00:40:12.550
I was in no
mood to thank my purchaser.

544
00:40:12.626 --> 00:40:15.288
That I can understand. Go on.

545
00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:17.788
I've resented you because your name
is Bishop.


546
00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:20.390
My thoughts have lumped you
with your uncle.


547
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:23.561
How was I to know
that a devil could have....


548
00:40:24.205 --> 00:40:26.935
That a devil could have an angel
for a niece?


549
00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:30.935
From a resentful man,
that is a pretty fair compliment.


550
00:40:31.879 --> 00:40:35.042
Have you any more reasons
for resenting me like that one?


551
00:40:35.249 --> 00:40:37.444
Indeed, I have. 
And the strongest of all...

552
00:40:38.152 --> 00:40:42.316
I've resented you
because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.


553
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.317
Do you understand that?

554
00:40:47.494 --> 00:40:48.961
I don't know.

555
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.058
Perhaps if you were to
explain further, I....


556
00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:55.501
I've already talked too much.

557
00:40:57.871 --> 00:40:59.532
I'll open your mouth!

558
00:41:07.214 --> 00:41:10.274
You'll stay here
without food or water until you talk.


559
00:41:14.755 --> 00:41:17.918
- Why did you lie to your uncle?
- Because....


560
00:41:19.326 --> 00:41:21.954
Dr. Blood,
you're a physician and should know.


561
00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:26.097
Is it not considered unhealthy
for a slave to be seen at a boat?


562
00:41:27.034 --> 00:41:30.128
- Why should it be?
- Boats put out to sea.


563
00:41:30.337 --> 00:41:31.929
Slaves may not.

564
00:41:33.641 --> 00:41:35.768
You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?

565
00:41:35.843 --> 00:41:37.003
Am I?

566
00:41:37.478 --> 00:41:40.003
The Governor will be waiting for you.

567
00:41:41.048 --> 00:41:42.072
Yes.

568
00:41:43.384 --> 00:41:46.785
Miss Bishop, it's difficult
for an Irishman to apologize.


569
00:41:46.987 --> 00:41:50.115
But I hope you can forgive me
for having thought badly of you.


570
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.681
I will, if you tell me
how you think of me now.


571
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.127
How I think of you now? 
I think of you....

572
00:41:57.631 --> 00:42:01.499
I think of you as the woman who owns me.
Her slave.


573
00:42:02.803 --> 00:42:05.897
But I think the man is lucky
who can count you his friend.


574
00:42:05.973 --> 00:42:07.873
I think you know you can.

575
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.514
Your slave is grateful
for all marks of favor.


576
00:42:19.586 --> 00:42:21.747
When you forget your slavery
and go so far...


577
00:42:21.822 --> 00:42:23.289
Now there, you're mistaken.

578
00:42:23.357 --> 00:42:26.053
However far this slave may go,
he won't forget.


579
00:42:27.828 --> 00:42:31.025
It's a characteristic we Irish
have in common with the elephants.


580
00:43:25.552 --> 00:43:27.747
Hello. Where are you going?

581
00:43:28.389 --> 00:43:31.449
You're so much improved,
I was returning to the stockade.


582
00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:34.585
Don't leave me tonight. 
I'm a sick man.

583
00:43:35.562 --> 00:43:37.757
I assure you, sir,
there's nothing more I can do.


584
00:43:37.831 --> 00:43:39.526
There must be something.

585
00:43:40.033 --> 00:43:42.228
Perhaps you ought to bleed me again.

586
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:46.897
Very well, then, if you wish it.

587
00:43:49.977 --> 00:43:52.275
But mind, no more softness about this.

588
00:43:52.546 --> 00:43:56.243
I'm gonna have you well by midnight
if I have to bleed you to death.


589
00:44:11.265 --> 00:44:13.199
- Who goes there?
- Peter Blood.


590
00:44:25.813 --> 00:44:28.577
- Jeremy, what's happened?
- Water.


591
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.685
Easy, lad.

592
00:44:40.994 --> 00:44:43.121
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

593
00:44:43.764 --> 00:44:47.598
- Tell him what, Jeremy?
- About our plans.


594
00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.094
My back.

595
00:44:54.808 --> 00:44:56.503
Help me.

596
00:44:58.812 --> 00:45:00.973
- Who did this?
- Bishop.


597
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:04.317
Bishop. Swine!

598
00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:06.716
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

599
00:45:16.997 --> 00:45:20.831
- Ls our boat still standing in at the bay?
- Yes, Jeremy.


600
00:45:21.668 --> 00:45:24.068
I wondered if I was
still out of my mind.

601
00:45:25.439 --> 00:45:29.239
I've been seeing boats
sailing in and out...


602
00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:34.209
in and out, but ours will never sail.

603
00:45:35.215 --> 00:45:36.477
Not now.

604
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.278
Or if it does, you'll sail without me.

605
00:45:41.388 --> 00:45:45.222
What?
And get lost at sea without our navigator?


606
00:45:45.292 --> 00:45:49.092
- Nonsense, lad.
- We are not going this time.


607
00:45:49.863 --> 00:45:51.694
It's hopeless for all of us.

608
00:45:54.034 --> 00:45:55.695
We'll manage somehow.

609
00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:06.777
- What are you doing here?
- Doing?


610
00:46:07.781 --> 00:46:09.305
Why, the duties of my office.

611
00:46:09.383 --> 00:46:11.977
I said he was to have
no food nor drink till I ordered.


612
00:46:12.052 --> 00:46:14.282
Sure now, I never heard you.

613
00:46:14.354 --> 00:46:15.946
How could you? 
You weren't here.

614
00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:18.890
Then how do you expect me
to know what orders you've given?


615
00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:24.987
In the name of humanity!
If you know the word.


616
00:46:25.265 --> 00:46:28.234
- You dare take that tone with me?
- Yes, I do!


617
00:46:29.903 --> 00:46:31.837
I've been too soft with you...

618
00:46:32.439 --> 00:46:34.168
but that shall be mended.

619
00:46:34.474 --> 00:46:35.873
Kent, tie him up!

620
00:46:39.813 --> 00:46:42.611
Had it easy here up
to now. Get up there.

621
00:46:54.828 --> 00:46:56.659
Now I'll take this rod to you...

622
00:46:56.763 --> 00:46:59.823
until there's not an inch of hide left
on your dirty carcass.


623
00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:01.329
Another beating?

624
00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:04.666
This will be a good half-dozen of them
you've given me in promise.


625
00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:07.036
This will be as
real as it is overdue.

626
00:47:07.608 --> 00:47:10.873
And what becomes of His Excellency
the Governor's gouty foot?


627
00:47:10.944 --> 00:47:15.005
You'll not save yourself with that device
this time. Nothing will save you.


628
00:47:19.886 --> 00:47:22.320
Pirates! Spanish pirates!

629
00:47:27.027 --> 00:47:29.518
This is what I call a timely interruption.

630
00:47:30.163 --> 00:47:33.132
Though what will come of it,
the devil himself only knows.


631
00:50:01.715 --> 00:50:04.684
We've got to get through the town
to get to the boat.


632
00:50:04.951 --> 00:50:06.441
Wait here, lads.

633
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.432
It's me. Mr. Nuttall.

634
00:50:58.505 --> 00:51:00.473
You came close to being
the ex-Mr. Nuttall.


635
00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.008
Wouldn't be the first death I died today.

636
00:51:03.777 --> 00:51:06.371
We can't stay here waiting for them
to catch sight of us.


637
00:51:06.446 --> 00:51:08.004
Let's get to the boat down this way.

638
00:51:32.839 --> 00:51:34.966
Sunk to the bottom of the briny.

639
00:51:35.475 --> 00:51:37.943
And it sunk our hopes with it.

640
00:51:39.512 --> 00:51:42.072
- Perhaps not.
- What do you mean, Peter?


641
00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:47.680
- He's gonna take a bath?
- Yes, but not for cleanliness.


642
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:51.252
Since the Spaniards have been
thoughtless enough to sink our craft...


643
00:51:51.324 --> 00:51:54.487
I'll see if I can't persuade them
to lend us one of theirs.


644
00:53:56.983 --> 00:54:01.443
Your Excellency,
facts are so often dull and deplorable.


645
00:54:01.788 --> 00:54:04.188
Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you...

646
00:54:04.257 --> 00:54:08.353
it is my painful duty to inform you
that 250 of my men...


647
00:54:08.428 --> 00:54:11.829
are now complete masters
of the town of Port Royal.


648
00:54:12.198 --> 00:54:15.099
Your most worthy islanders
have been disarmed...


649
00:54:15.402 --> 00:54:18.269
and your city is now
absolutely in the hands...


650
00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:22.035
of the forces of His Majesty
King Philip of Spain.


651
00:54:22.542 --> 00:54:25.511
Now that you have our city,
what do you want with it?


652
00:54:25.712 --> 00:54:28.738
For a price,
I could forebear reducing it to ashes.


653
00:54:29.582 --> 00:54:33.643
- What price?
- 200,000 pieces of eight.


654
00:54:34.954 --> 00:54:37.445
200,000 pieces of eight?

655
00:55:35.014 --> 00:55:37.539
That's why we waited till this morning
to put to sea.


656
00:55:37.617 --> 00:55:41.280
We've a message for those Spaniards.
They are on their way now to receive it.


657
00:55:41.354 --> 00:55:43.982
- Hagthorpe, man the guns!
- Clear deck!


658
00:55:51.297 --> 00:55:54.562
- All ready, Hagthorpe?
- Aye, Peter, ready.


659
00:55:54.634 --> 00:55:57.194
Give them a taste of their own iron!

660
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.905
You've done it, Hagthorpe!

661
00:56:43.483 --> 00:56:44.882
Hurrah!

662
00:56:49.255 --> 00:56:50.984
Didn't I tell you
I was a gunner, sir?

663
00:56:51.057 --> 00:56:53.855
You did that,
you son of a Yorkshire steer...


664
00:56:53.927 --> 00:56:56.828
and bless your rusty heart,
it's a gunner you are!


665
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.958
It's the Governor.

666
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:07.239
It must be that some brave party
of citizens captured the ship.


667
00:57:07.307 --> 00:57:08.831
I think you're right.

668
00:57:17.951 --> 00:57:20.545
Someone should go aboard
and congratulate them.


669
00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.815
Yes. My foot.

670
00:57:23.056 --> 00:57:26.617
Since your gout so unhappily
prevents you, allow me to be the one.


671
00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:29.662
Go ahead. You've always wanted
to be governor anyway.


672
00:57:30.163 --> 00:57:31.289
Don't be nervous.

673
00:57:31.364 --> 00:57:33.161
- Man those sweeps.
- Aye, sir.


674
00:57:38.838 --> 00:57:41.671
- Shall we hoist anchor, Peter?
- Aye. Get under way.


675
00:57:43.409 --> 00:57:45.502
There's another boat approaching.

676
00:57:51.985 --> 00:57:54.215
It looks like Col. Bishop.

677
00:57:54.787 --> 00:57:56.345
- Who?
- Bishop.


678
00:57:56.422 --> 00:57:58.754
The fool would come blundering
in just now.


679
00:57:58.825 --> 00:58:02.591
- I'll make short work of him.
- No, Hagthorpe, none of that.


680
00:58:25.618 --> 00:58:28.610
But.... Who....

681
00:58:42.669 --> 00:58:45.797
Welcome aboard the <i>Cinco Lagos,</i>
Colonel darling.


682
00:58:46.406 --> 00:58:47.896
You? Was it....

683
00:58:48.508 --> 00:58:53.138
Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took
this ship and turned defeat into victory?


684
00:58:53.212 --> 00:58:57.308
Myself it was. Myself and these,
my friends. And your friends.


685
00:58:59.686 --> 00:59:01.745
And you saved my money, too!

686
00:59:08.094 --> 00:59:11.325
- Yes, it was heroic.
- Heroic, is it?


687
00:59:11.397 --> 00:59:13.365
It was epic.

688
00:59:13.766 --> 00:59:14.892
You amaze me.

689
00:59:14.967 --> 00:59:18.027
On my soul, you deserve well.
You all deserve well.


690
00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:21.196
- You shall find me grateful.
- How grateful?


691
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:25.609
I shall ask His Excellency to write home
to the King an account of your exploit.


692
00:59:25.678 --> 00:59:28.010
Perhaps some of your sentencing
shall be remitted.


693
00:59:28.081 --> 00:59:30.276
That's just about
what we expected from you.


694
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:33.478
Now, Wolf, Col. 
Bishop has a kind heart.

695
00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.813
- But what kind, I'd hate to say.
- What is this?


696
00:59:35.888 --> 00:59:39.790
Why, Colonel darling,
such unusual generosity from you...


697
00:59:39.859 --> 00:59:42.020
must be making you feel unwell.

698
00:59:42.161 --> 00:59:45.562
- As your physician, I'd prescribe...
- A bit of neck-stretching.


699
00:59:51.104 --> 00:59:54.096
Lads, we shouldn't hang this man.

700
00:59:54.173 --> 00:59:55.970
- No?
- No.


701
01:00:06.018 --> 01:00:07.383
Tie him over the end of a gun!

702
01:00:07.453 --> 01:00:09.921
I'll scatter his innards
all over the sugarcane field.


703
01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:12.219
You're wasting words, I say. Hang him!

704
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:23.234
Wait, lads. Hanging's
too dignified for him.


705
01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:24.994
Can you swim, Colonel darling?

706
01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:28.768
We're giving you the chance to cool off
some of that excessive heat of yours.


707
01:00:28.841 --> 01:00:30.968
Over the side with him, men!

708
01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:42.679
One, two...

709
01:00:43.289 --> 01:00:44.779
three!

710
01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:54.131
Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this...

711
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.828
if I spend the rest
of my life doing it!

712
01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:01.231
And then the whale came,
and the whale swallowed Jonah. I hope.


713
01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:04.741
Goodbye, Jonah. 
Don't forget to write.

714
01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:11.215
What's the next move, Peter?

715
01:01:11.384 --> 01:01:14.751
Up anchor! Wolf, man the capstan bar.

716
01:01:14.954 --> 01:01:20.324
Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft.
Thomas, get those men over here.


717
01:01:25.898 --> 01:01:29.664
Round you go, men!
That's no water wheel you're working.


718
01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:40.169
- Can you handle it, Jeremy?
- Aye, aye, Peter.


719
01:01:40.246 --> 01:01:42.111
We sail. Hard to starboard.

720
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:48.614
Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft!
There's no chains to hold you now!


721
01:01:51.524 --> 01:01:52.923
Break out those sails...

722
01:01:52.992 --> 01:01:56.519
and watch them fill with the wind
that's carrying us all to freedom.


723
01:02:52.718 --> 01:02:54.310
We, the undersigned...

724
01:02:57.056 --> 01:02:58.887
are men without a country...

725
01:03:00.393 --> 01:03:03.692
outlaws in our own land,
and homeless outcasts in any other.


726
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:07.428
Desperate men,
we go to seek a desperate fortune.


727
01:03:12.505 --> 01:03:15.167
Therefore, we do here and now
band ourselves...


728
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:17.106
into a brotherhood of buccaneers...

729
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:20.308
to practice the trade of piracy
on the high seas.


730
01:03:20.613 --> 01:03:23.343
We, the hunted, will now hunt!

731
01:03:25.518 --> 01:03:28.612
To that end, we enter into
the following articles of agreement.


732
01:03:28.688 --> 01:03:29.780
First...

733
01:03:32.325 --> 01:03:35.419
we pledge ourselves
to be bound together as brothers...


734
01:03:35.995 --> 01:03:38.088
in a life-and-death friendship...

735
01:03:38.664 --> 01:03:41.224
sharing alike in fortune and in trouble.

736
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.097
Second article.

737
01:03:46.603 --> 01:03:50.004
All moneys and valuables
which may come into our possession...


738
01:03:50.573 --> 01:03:53.201
shall be lumped together
into a common fund...


739
01:03:53.676 --> 01:03:56.110
and from this fund
shall first be taken the money...


740
01:03:56.179 --> 01:03:58.374
to fit, rig, and provision the ship.

741
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:03.813
After that, the recompense each
will receive who is wounded as follows:


742
01:04:05.155 --> 01:04:08.955
For the loss of a right arm,

743
01:04:09.993 --> 01:04:12.359
Left arm, 500.

744
01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:15.927
For the loss of a right leg, 500.

745
01:04:16.332 --> 01:04:18.664
Left leg, 400.

746
01:04:19.302 --> 01:04:21.327
A fellow can get rich if he's lucky.

747
01:04:21.471 --> 01:04:22.699
Greedy.

748
01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:26.668
If a man conceal any treasure captured...

749
01:04:26.743 --> 01:04:30.179
or fail to place it in the general fund,
he shall be marooned.


750
01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:32.475
Set ashore on a deserted isle...

751
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:35.347
and there left with a bottle of water,
a loaf of bread...


752
01:04:35.618 --> 01:04:37.415
and a pistol with one load.

753
01:04:38.555 --> 01:04:41.854
If a man shall be drunk on duty,
he shall receive the same fate.


754
01:04:43.293 --> 01:04:46.558
And if a man shall molest
a woman captive against her will...


755
01:04:46.996 --> 01:04:49.692
he, too,
shall receive the same punishment.


756
01:04:51.434 --> 01:04:56.064
These articles entered into,
this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.


757
01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:02.143
Now, men, you've heard the agreement.

758
01:05:02.545 --> 01:05:05.605
It's the world against us
and us against the world.


759
01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:10.485
"His hand will be against every man,
and every man's hand against him."


760
01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.118
Genesis 16:12.

761
01:05:14.157 --> 01:05:18.787
Those of you in favor of these articles,
raise your right hands and say aye!


762
01:05:19.262 --> 01:05:20.559
Aye!

763
01:06:26.629 --> 01:06:28.392
Blood!

764
01:06:29.065 --> 01:06:32.296
This impertinent,
ungoverned rascal must be eradicated.


765
01:06:32.635 --> 01:06:33.932
Yes, Your Majesty.

766
01:06:34.003 --> 01:06:36.904
Sinking Spanish ships
causes me enough embarrassment...


767
01:06:36.973 --> 01:06:40.033
- but he sinks English ships as well.
- Yes, Your Majesty.


768
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:41.906
Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it?

769
01:06:41.978 --> 01:06:44.674
He does his best,
but conditions on the island...


770
01:06:44.747 --> 01:06:48.683
Silence, Willoughby! I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.


771
01:06:49.485 --> 01:06:51.612
I know your feelings towards me.

772
01:06:53.356 --> 01:06:57.019
Sunderland, what are you Secretary
of State for? Have you no solution?


773
01:06:57.093 --> 01:07:00.688
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Get your head off that hinge. Speak up.


774
01:07:00.763 --> 01:07:04.597
Since Gov. Steed is incapable,
you should appoint a stronger man.


775
01:07:04.701 --> 01:07:05.793
Who?

776
01:07:05.868 --> 01:07:08.928
Col. Bishop assures me
that if he were in power...


777
01:07:09.072 --> 01:07:10.869
he would not rest day or night...

778
01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.842
until this Capt. Blood
was swinging on execution dock.


779
01:07:15.278 --> 01:07:17.269
Angling for the office, is he?

780
01:07:17.413 --> 01:07:20.678
What difference
if he's the iron man we need?


781
01:07:22.619 --> 01:07:24.314
Draw up the appointment.

782
01:07:24.954 --> 01:07:28.117
I've already taken the liberty of doing so,
Your Majesty.


783
01:07:48.544 --> 01:07:51.570
Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed,
I wish you both a pleasant journey.


784
01:07:51.648 --> 01:07:55.675
I thank you, Governor.
Again, congratulations, Gov. Bishop.


785
01:07:56.052 --> 01:07:59.783
- May your term of office be successful.
- Thank you, my friend.


786
01:07:59.989 --> 01:08:02.287
Arabella dear,
have a nice holiday in England.


787
01:08:02.358 --> 01:08:03.689
I'm sure I shall.

788
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.760
- Captain.
- Yes, sir.


789
01:08:04.827 --> 01:08:07.295
- Keep a weather eye open for pirates.
- Very well, sir.


790
01:08:07.363 --> 01:08:10.855
Before you return, Arabella,
I shall have the sea swept clean of them.


791
01:08:10.933 --> 01:08:13.925
Particularly one.
I think you know whom I mean.


792
01:08:17.573 --> 01:08:20.872
I hope he gets the gout
the infernal office gave me.


793
01:08:21.277 --> 01:08:24.542
Come along. Goodbye.

794
01:08:33.456 --> 01:08:36.425
Thomas Fulton. 
One share, no injuries.

795
01:08:37.794 --> 01:08:42.163
James Graham. One share,
plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound.


796
01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:47.262
Zachary Stevens.
For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo...


797
01:08:47.337 --> 01:08:49.532
one share, plus £10 of silver.

798
01:08:51.941 --> 01:08:56.844
Oliver Clark. One share, plus 400 pieces
of eight for the loss of his left leg.


799
01:08:56.913 --> 01:08:58.847
There you are, Oliver, 
I'm proud of you.

800
01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:03.781
Lord Chester Dyke.
No injury, one share and £5 of silver.


801
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.847
Anton Brazilimo.

802
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:09.319
Andrew Fell.

803
01:09:10.393 --> 01:09:13.988
One share, plus 500 pieces of eight
for the loss of his left arm.


804
01:09:14.464 --> 01:09:16.659
There you are, 
Andrew, and good luck.

805
01:09:17.133 --> 01:09:20.000
David Sampson. 
One share, no injuries.

806
01:09:22.972 --> 01:09:27.136
Honesty Nuttall. 
No injuries, one share.

807
01:09:28.711 --> 01:09:30.076
Hold on, Captain.

808
01:09:30.146 --> 01:09:33.673
How about me little toe,
heroically sacrificed in battle?


809
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:37.686
Honesty Nuttall. One share, and nothing
for the toe he just shot off himself.


810
01:09:41.157 --> 01:09:42.647
You stupid numskull.

811
01:09:42.725 --> 01:09:46.718
You should have shot out your brains
and left your toe for thinking with.


812
01:09:56.839 --> 01:09:58.568
Ahoy, the deck!

813
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.537
An English ship on the port bow!

814
01:10:13.322 --> 01:10:14.619
So it is.

815
01:10:14.724 --> 01:10:18.251
A fine big ship, too,
as far as I can judge from this distance.


816
01:10:18.928 --> 01:10:20.862
Shall we sail over
and give them a surprise?


817
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.954
No, Peter.

818
01:10:22.031 --> 01:10:23.896
The men are set
on putting in at Tortuga.

819
01:10:23.966 --> 01:10:25.934
Their gold's burning
holes in their pockets.


820
01:10:26.002 --> 01:10:28.368
What's one ship more
or less to us now?

821
01:10:28.571 --> 01:10:30.971
It appears I have
a mutiny on my hands.

822
01:10:45.888 --> 01:10:49.756
What ho, the deck! 
A ship to starboard!

823
01:10:53.129 --> 01:10:54.892
It may be a pirate!

824
01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:11.068
Very well, then.
Sail on, little ship, back to England...


825
01:11:12.315 --> 01:11:14.044
where we may never go.

826
01:11:15.384 --> 01:11:18.615
You'll never know
how close you came to not getting there.


827
01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.528
Your turn, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

828
01:12:32.595 --> 01:12:33.595
Up!

829
01:12:36.299 --> 01:12:37.891
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

830
01:12:42.505 --> 01:12:44.097
<i>Again, my captain.</i>

831
01:12:45.675 --> 01:12:47.142
<i>- Are you ready?</i>
- Right.


832
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:49.700
<i>It's good.</i>

833
01:12:49.946 --> 01:12:51.675
This time, my friend, huh?

834
01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:56.482
<i>- You missed.
- No.</i>


835
01:12:56.886 --> 01:12:59.753
I am defeated.
You win the prize, Capt. Blood.


836
01:13:00.122 --> 01:13:02.454
<i>- Goodbye, my dear.
- Goodbye.</i>


837
01:13:03.893 --> 01:13:05.588
<i>What a charming captain.</i>

838
01:13:06.262 --> 01:13:08.196
Some other time, perhaps.

839
01:13:08.264 --> 01:13:09.731
<i>Why?</i>

840
01:13:09.799 --> 01:13:11.926
What sort of a man are you?

841
01:13:12.401 --> 01:13:15.996
I'm the sort of man you like, my dear.
A man with money.


842
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.937
<i>The money!</i>

843
01:13:31.053 --> 01:13:34.147
<i>Mon capitaine,</i>
what a pair we would make.


844
01:13:34.223 --> 01:13:37.920
In all the Caribbean,
there is no buccaneer so strong as me.


845
01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.152
Except you.

846
01:13:39.261 --> 01:13:41.388
You almost flatter me, Levasseur.

847
01:13:41.464 --> 01:13:45.264
Why do you hold off your consent so long?
We become partners.


848
01:13:45.334 --> 01:13:47.894
You've been in Tortuga
these three, four months.


849
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:50.664
You must be even so much
in need of gold as I.


850
01:13:51.574 --> 01:13:54.008
Such a partnership requires sober thought.

851
01:13:54.076 --> 01:13:57.341
My poor head has been dancing with rum
this whole week past.


852
01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.640
Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest
this side the Caribbean.


853
01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:04.152
With your brain and my strength,
there is nothing we cannot do.


854
01:14:05.121 --> 01:14:07.749
There's very little I
can't do all by myself.


855
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.825
<i>Long live Capt. 
Levasseur!</i>

856
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.436
And here's to Capt. Blood!

857
01:14:23.506 --> 01:14:24.506
Hurrah!

858
01:14:32.148 --> 01:14:35.379
<i>Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend.</i>

859
01:14:35.651 --> 01:14:38.017
- You're next, Peter.
<i>- Mon capitaine.</i>


860
01:14:39.488 --> 01:14:42.651
It's clearly understood, then,
that we sail under my articles.


861
01:14:42.725 --> 01:14:45.421
Those very severe articles of yours?

862
01:14:45.494 --> 01:14:48.292
<i>Mais oui,</i> I sail under the articles
of a girls' <i>séminaire...</i>


863
01:14:48.364 --> 01:14:51.458
to have you as my partner, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

864
01:14:57.106 --> 01:14:59.734
Women will be the death of you yet,
Levasseur.


865
01:15:00.609 --> 01:15:04.045
It is a very pleasant way to die,
even if it is expensive.


866
01:15:05.748 --> 01:15:08.581
What is the first order,
<i>mon capitaine</i> partner?


867
01:15:08.784 --> 01:15:11.548
We sail on the tide.
Outside the harbor, we'll scatter.


868
01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:15.716
Each ship will proceed singly to pick up
any stray ships we'll find on the journey.


869
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:17.816
We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra.

870
01:15:17.893 --> 01:15:19.121
<i>Magnifique!</i>

871
01:15:19.195 --> 01:15:21.925
I give you the toast. 
To our great success!

872
01:15:21.997 --> 01:15:25.228
Let me give one.
To the greatest captain on the Caribbean!


873
01:15:25.301 --> 01:15:28.634
<i>- Oui!</i> To <i>Capitaine Levasseur!</i>
- Capt. Blood.


874
01:15:29.105 --> 01:15:30.629
Bravo!

875
01:15:30.706 --> 01:15:33.937
The articles aside,
let's give a toast to Capt. Blood.


876
01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:36.935
<i>Capitaine Levasseur.</i>

877
01:15:37.012 --> 01:15:39.276
To the greatest captain on the coast.

878
01:15:44.253 --> 01:15:46.721
The greatest captain on the coast, is it?

879
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:51.518
Methinks the greatest captain
on the coast...


880
01:15:51.927 --> 01:15:53.690
has just made the greatest mistake...

881
01:15:53.763 --> 01:15:56.425
the most ordinary common fool
could make.


882
01:16:11.914 --> 01:16:15.782
It's been so lovely. I'd like to stay
forever. You've all been so kind.


883
01:16:16.385 --> 01:16:18.444
Come again and visit us soon, dear.

884
01:16:18.954 --> 01:16:21.946
England is so much more beautiful
when you're here.


885
01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:24.649
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


886
01:16:25.127 --> 01:16:28.290
- Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye, dear.


887
01:16:28.364 --> 01:16:30.491
- Goodbye, Amelia.
- Goodbye, Mary.


888
01:16:45.714 --> 01:16:49.946
However else the court may have changed,
the art of flattery still flourishes.


889
01:16:50.019 --> 01:16:51.646
Stab me if it's flattery.

890
01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.747
When the King ordered me on this journey
as a special emissary to the West Indies...


891
01:16:55.825 --> 01:16:59.022
I looked forward with some trepidation
to a life among the savages.


892
01:16:59.094 --> 01:17:01.494
But when I found
you were one of those savages...


893
01:17:01.564 --> 01:17:05.500
returning to your native heath,
my grateful eyes could hardly believe it.


894
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:10.996
You pictured us running around
in animal skins, eating raw meat?


895
01:17:11.073 --> 01:17:13.769
Why not, in a country filled
with Indians and pirates?


896
01:17:13.843 --> 01:17:18.644
Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen
to hear of a wild rogue named Blood?


897
01:17:18.848 --> 01:17:20.281
- Peter Blood?
- Yes.


898
01:17:21.517 --> 01:17:23.678
No. I don't know him.

899
01:17:24.253 --> 01:17:26.744
I hardly number pirates
among my acquaintances.


900
01:17:26.822 --> 01:17:29.689
Of course not. Stupid of me.
I merely mention him in passing.


901
01:17:29.758 --> 01:17:32.090
Because he's one of the objects
of my mission.


902
01:17:32.161 --> 01:17:33.185
- Your mission?
- Yes.


903
01:17:33.262 --> 01:17:36.425
I've been sent to try to blot out
all this piracy, my dear.


904
01:17:36.498 --> 01:17:40.195
And in a manner
I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood.


905
01:17:43.505 --> 01:17:45.996
Ship on the port side, sir!

906
01:17:49.511 --> 01:17:51.945
Yes, that's a fine ship.

907
01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:59.148
- Captain, what ship is that?
- I don't know, Lord Willoughby.


908
01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:03.252
She flies the French flag.
She could be anything in these waters.


909
01:18:03.993 --> 01:18:07.224
- We're in pirate waters now, aren't we?
- Yes, we are.


910
01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:11.829
Yonder bank of low clouds
is the island of Virgen Magra.


911
01:18:12.301 --> 01:18:14.166
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Very.


912
01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:17.203
Could she be a
pirate ship, by any chance?

913
01:18:17.273 --> 01:18:20.436
Any ship we meet in the Caribbean
could be a pirate ship.


914
01:18:26.749 --> 01:18:30.776
Ahoy, English ship off port side!

915
01:18:30.853 --> 01:18:33.253
Prepare to come onto starboard tack!

916
01:18:33.322 --> 01:18:35.017
Starboard tack it is!

917
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:36.284
Steady at the helm!

918
01:18:38.027 --> 01:18:39.324
Ready?

919
01:18:39.395 --> 01:18:40.885
Stand by your guns.

920
01:18:47.002 --> 01:18:48.663
<i>What luck.</i>

921
01:18:48.837 --> 01:18:52.773
Just as I'm about to give up and anchor
to wait for my partner, Capt. Blood...


922
01:18:52.841 --> 01:18:55.537
this fine English prize
walks into my parlor and says:


923
01:18:55.611 --> 01:18:57.875
<i>"Hello, Capt. 
Levasseur. "</i>

924
01:18:57.947 --> 01:19:01.576
- We've got to give welcome, Cahusac.
<i>- Yes, and how.</i> Light it!


925
01:19:30.646 --> 01:19:33.979
The ransom for you two is fixed at

926
01:19:34.049 --> 01:19:35.516
I shall provide a boat for you...

927
01:19:35.584 --> 01:19:38.519
to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica
to collect it.


928
01:19:39.555 --> 01:19:43.457
Meanwhile, <i>mademoiselle</i> remains
with me as hostage.


929
01:19:43.759 --> 01:19:46.592
I find it very lonely on this island.

930
01:19:47.429 --> 01:19:50.626
I refuse absolutely and utterly!

931
01:19:50.699 --> 01:19:54.135
You know this? 
It is the rosary of pain.

932
01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:58.299
It is possible to screw a man's eyes
out of his head.


933
01:19:59.174 --> 01:20:01.608
Very well. Do your worst.

934
01:20:02.177 --> 01:20:03.177
<i>Alors!</i>

935
01:20:04.313 --> 01:20:05.473
No, stop!

936
01:20:05.547 --> 01:20:08.345
Lord Willoughby, thank you,
but don't be foolish.


937
01:20:08.717 --> 01:20:10.412
<i>Mademoiselle</i> is right.

938
01:20:10.519 --> 01:20:12.487
<i>Thank you, miss.</i>

939
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:15.884
I beg you to spare yourself
and the young lady.


940
01:20:15.958 --> 01:20:17.926
You know,
I've been too modest with you...


941
01:20:17.993 --> 01:20:20.894
but since I have said

942
01:20:20.963 --> 01:20:24.194
<i>eh bien,</i> I have said

943
01:20:24.266 --> 01:20:27.599
For what, if you please,
have you said 20,000 pieces of eight?


944
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.234
If it ain't the niece
of our old friend Col. Bishop.


945
01:20:34.777 --> 01:20:36.938
You don't recognize her. Mind that.

946
01:20:38.781 --> 01:20:40.078
What does he mean?

947
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:42.083
Your guess is as good as mine.

948
01:20:52.294 --> 01:20:55.229
- Good morning, Levasseur.
<i>- Hello, Captain.</i>


949
01:20:55.297 --> 01:20:56.821
- Cahusac.
<i>- Capitaine.</i>


950
01:20:57.232 --> 01:21:00.827
I arrived late last night and put
into a cove a few miles to the west.


951
01:21:00.903 --> 01:21:03.963
We've walked across
to give you good morning, but, faith...


952
01:21:04.039 --> 01:21:07.202
it seems we've interrupted
some business of yours.


953
01:21:07.276 --> 01:21:09.437
- Who are these people?
<i>- Oh, yes, here.</i>


954
01:21:09.511 --> 01:21:12.412
As you see, two prisoners.
I captured an English ship.


955
01:21:12.481 --> 01:21:14.813
Yes. We saw her coming across the spit.

956
01:21:14.883 --> 01:21:18.410
I must congratulate you, Levasseur.
I didn't so much as sight a sail.


957
01:21:18.554 --> 01:21:20.988
The fortunes of war, my partner.

958
01:21:21.123 --> 01:21:23.421
And these are also the fortunes of war?

959
01:21:23.492 --> 01:21:26.586
Big fortunes. A nobleman and the niece
of the Governor of Jamaica.


960
01:21:26.662 --> 01:21:27.686
Really?

961
01:21:27.763 --> 01:21:29.958
I suppose congratulations
are again in order...


962
01:21:30.032 --> 01:21:32.865
but have you forgotten there's an article
in our agreement...


963
01:21:32.935 --> 01:21:34.800
forbidding the taking of women prisoners?

964
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:37.600
That's a foolish article of yours.

965
01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.071
I was not aware you regarded it so
when we signed.


966
01:21:41.143 --> 01:21:44.670
Would you care to dispute
my opinion now, your men against mine?


967
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:50.949
Not this morning, thank you.
As you say, a foolish article.


968
01:21:51.019 --> 01:21:52.452
<i>Heard, my friend.</i>

969
01:21:52.521 --> 01:21:56.048
That is why these are prisoners
of my own, a matter personal.


970
01:21:56.325 --> 01:21:58.589
- And the 20,000 pieces of eight?
- Their ransom.


971
01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.424
- That is also a personal matter?
- Lt is.


972
01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:05.088
Obviously, these two prisoners,
and particularly the young lady...


973
01:22:05.167 --> 01:22:09.228
must be kept in someone's hands for,
shall we say, safekeeping...


974
01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:10.999
but why your hands?

975
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.931
Why shouldn't Pierre have her,
or Roch, or Jacob...


976
01:22:14.243 --> 01:22:16.768
since she's as much their property
as yours?


977
01:22:17.179 --> 01:22:21.047
Or doesn't that please you?
You'd like to keep her for yourself.


978
01:22:23.018 --> 01:22:25.111
And who might that be, do you suppose?

979
01:22:25.187 --> 01:22:28.623
- That is your Capt. Blood.
- Capt. Blood?


980
01:22:29.825 --> 01:22:30.849
Now, my captain...

981
01:22:30.926 --> 01:22:34.123
since you covet our joint property
of war, you may have her...


982
01:22:34.196 --> 01:22:36.357
providing you're willing to buy her.

983
01:22:36.431 --> 01:22:39.093
- Buy her?
- At the price you yourself have put on her.


984
01:22:39.168 --> 01:22:40.863
20,000 pieces of eight.

985
01:22:40.936 --> 01:22:43.370
The ransom is to
be paid by Gov. Bishop.

986
01:22:43.438 --> 01:22:45.303
It is for division when it comes.

987
01:22:45.374 --> 01:22:48.343
But if the Governor should refuse to pay
the ransom, what then?


988
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:51.868
No. If you're to keep the girl meanwhile,
pay the ransom.


989
01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:54.615
Let it be your risk to collect it
from the Governor.


990
01:22:54.683 --> 01:22:56.344
Capt. Blood is right.

991
01:22:56.418 --> 01:23:00.047
- Lt's in the articles.
- What's in the articles, you fools?


992
01:23:00.122 --> 01:23:03.353
Where do you suppose
I have 20,000 pieces of eight?


993
01:23:03.425 --> 01:23:05.359
- Let someone buy her who has.
- Who?


994
01:23:05.427 --> 01:23:06.724
- L.
- You?


995
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.021
Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward.

996
01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:18.730
Here they are, Peter.

997
01:23:20.275 --> 01:23:23.210
I bid 20,000 pieces of eight.

998
01:23:23.512 --> 01:23:25.673
Can you improve on that, Levasseur?

999
01:23:26.481 --> 01:23:28.540
I don't wish to be bought by you.

1000
01:23:32.955 --> 01:23:35.389
As a lady once said to a slave...

1001
01:23:35.457 --> 01:23:38.858
you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.


1002
01:23:42.231 --> 01:23:45.325
- You want the girl?
- Why not?


1003
01:23:45.734 --> 01:23:48.100
And I'm willing to
pay for what I want.

1004
01:23:49.137 --> 01:23:52.129
Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls.

1005
01:23:54.176 --> 01:23:56.337
At what do you value each of those?

1006
01:24:00.549 --> 01:24:02.676
1,000 pieces each.

1007
01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:06.551
They're worth rather more, but very well.
Here are 12.


1008
01:24:06.622 --> 01:24:10.615
The three-fifths the value of the prize
due your ship for having made the capture.


1009
01:24:10.692 --> 01:24:14.025
For the share due my men,
I make myself responsible.


1010
01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:30.470
Now, Wolf, will you be so kind
as to take my property aboard ship?


1011
01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.510
And that settles that, my captain partner.

1012
01:24:36.184 --> 01:24:38.914
- No, you don't!
- Stop, <i>Capitaine!</i>


1013
01:24:40.422 --> 01:24:43.152
Wait! You'll not take her while I live!

1014
01:24:43.225 --> 01:24:45.420
Then I'll take her when you're dead!

1015
01:24:47.195 --> 01:24:50.858
<i>- Capitaine,</i> it has been honorably settled.
- Lt has not been settled for me!


1016
01:24:50.932 --> 01:24:54.163
What is a girl, more or less?
Do not be a fool, <i>Capitaine!</i>


1017
01:24:54.236 --> 01:24:55.703
<i>It's my business.</i>

1018
01:25:01.643 --> 01:25:05.443
Two breaches in our articles committed
by you. You should be marooned.


1019
01:25:06.315 --> 01:25:09.011
It's what I intended
for you in the end...

1020
01:25:09.084 --> 01:25:13.453
but since you prefer it this way,
you muckrake, I'll be humoring you.


1021
01:26:22.991 --> 01:26:24.049
Up!

1022
01:27:23.652 --> 01:27:27.418
And that, my friend, ends a partnership
that should never have begun.


1023
01:27:54.716 --> 01:27:57.344
All these things I've gathered
in my journeys.


1024
01:27:59.254 --> 01:28:02.712
I've gone far since I was a slave
on your uncle's plantation...


1025
01:28:03.425 --> 01:28:05.893
thousands of restless, hectic miles.

1026
01:28:06.461 --> 01:28:09.328
But somehow tonight,
I've got a strange feeling...


1027
01:28:09.397 --> 01:28:11.388
that my journey's almost over.

1028
01:28:13.869 --> 01:28:15.461
You see these ankle rings?

1029
01:28:15.537 --> 01:28:18.233
They came from a ship
that was out from Persia.


1030
01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.671
And these pearls...

1031
01:28:20.976 --> 01:28:24.036
they're the choice from a fleet
we captured off the Azores.


1032
01:28:24.145 --> 01:28:27.205
- Have you ever seen such pearls?
- Yes, I have.


1033
01:28:27.516 --> 01:28:31.680
They're like the pearls you sometimes
use for making purchases, are they not?


1034
01:28:34.723 --> 01:28:37.715
- Yes, they are.
- How many lives did they cost?


1035
01:28:39.027 --> 01:28:41.621
As few as possible.
It wasn't lives I was after.


1036
01:28:41.696 --> 01:28:44.062
- What, then?
- I never quite knew.


1037
01:28:44.466 --> 01:28:48.459
Some urge that drove me on.
Revenge, I suppose.


1038
01:28:49.404 --> 01:28:51.463
But I've had my fill of revenge.

1039
01:28:52.541 --> 01:28:55.704
I often wondered
why I bothered to save all these things.


1040
01:28:56.111 --> 01:28:58.045
Tonight I know it's because...

1041
01:28:58.914 --> 01:29:01.348
one day you'd be here in this cabin
to wear them.


1042
01:29:01.416 --> 01:29:02.815
I'll never wear them, never!

1043
01:29:02.884 --> 01:29:05.853
Those nor any other plunder gotten
by a thief and pirate.


1044
01:29:06.955 --> 01:29:08.422
Thief and pirate.

1045
01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:10.289
I've seen your pirate ways.

1046
01:29:10.358 --> 01:29:12.451
I've seen myself bargained for
and fought over.


1047
01:29:12.527 --> 01:29:14.256
A combat between jackals.

1048
01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:17.095
But I thought you understood.

1049
01:29:17.165 --> 01:29:18.860
You mean you thought you'd bought me.

1050
01:29:18.934 --> 01:29:21.494
I suppose I should have regarded that
as a compliment.


1051
01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:24.869
You pirates are used to taking
without the formality of purchase.


1052
01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:27.340
I advise you to go back to your ladies
at Tortuga...


1053
01:29:27.409 --> 01:29:29.536
who are thrilled by your bold,
lawless ways.


1054
01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:32.045
I only hate you and despise you.

1055
01:29:33.014 --> 01:29:36.313
I might have expected your thanks
for what I've done this day...


1056
01:29:36.384 --> 01:29:38.215
but very well, let it be so.

1057
01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:42.613
I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you
how a thief and a pirate can deal.


1058
01:29:42.757 --> 01:29:45.021
Once, you bought me for a miserable £10.

1059
01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.491
Now I've bought you for considerably
more. The amount's of no matter.


1060
01:29:48.563 --> 01:29:50.997
What matters is
now I own you as you once owned me.


1061
01:29:51.066 --> 01:29:54.194
You're mine, do you understand?
Mine to do with as I please!


1062
01:30:01.042 --> 01:30:04.068
Capt. Blood,
Lord Willoughby sends his compliments...


1063
01:30:04.145 --> 01:30:06.841
and requests you to talk with him
at your convenience.


1064
01:30:06.915 --> 01:30:08.439
He's been sent by the King himself.

1065
01:30:08.516 --> 01:30:11.314
Tell him I'm not convenient
to any friend of the King's.


1066
01:30:11.386 --> 01:30:13.149
All I've got to say is good riddance...

1067
01:30:13.221 --> 01:30:15.314
as soon as I can get him
to his destination.


1068
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:16.390
I shall.

1069
01:30:17.926 --> 01:30:20.520
Jeremy. Wolverstone.

1070
01:30:22.197 --> 01:30:25.325
- Wolverstone!
- What is it, Peter?


1071
01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.290
We're changing course.

1072
01:30:27.369 --> 01:30:29.735
Draw down every rag of canvas
the yards will hold.


1073
01:30:29.804 --> 01:30:32.739
- Aye, aye, Peter, but....
- Jeremy!


1074
01:30:33.742 --> 01:30:35.835
All hands on deck!

1075
01:30:42.951 --> 01:30:45.112
- Jeremy!
- Coming, Peter!


1076
01:30:48.056 --> 01:30:49.819
Forever sleeping when I need you?

1077
01:30:49.891 --> 01:30:52.883
- I wasn't sleeping. I was...
- Never mind! Get ready to go about.


1078
01:30:52.961 --> 01:30:55.259
- Set the course for Port Royal.
- Port Royal?


1079
01:30:57.298 --> 01:30:59.892
But the English fleet is at Port Royal.
Col. Bishop...


1080
01:30:59.968 --> 01:31:02.562
Sweet, merciful heaven! 
Haven't you ears?

1081
01:31:02.637 --> 01:31:04.571
Set the course for Port Royal!

1082
01:31:09.778 --> 01:31:12.770
- Make speed there, Wolverstone.
- Speed it is, Peter.


1083
01:31:13.915 --> 01:31:17.078
- Follow we a helm, west by north.
- West by north, sir.


1084
01:31:24.959 --> 01:31:28.087
Make speed there! 
To your halyards!

1085
01:31:28.563 --> 01:31:32.693
Tacks and braces. 
We head for Port Royal.

1086
01:31:39.407 --> 01:31:41.967
Make speed there! 
That's the order!

1087
01:31:42.577 --> 01:31:44.101
Make speed there.

1088
01:31:46.047 --> 01:31:48.880
There's a gallows waiting
for each of us at Port Royal...


1089
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:51.418
and no man should be late
to his own hanging.


1090
01:31:53.288 --> 01:31:55.085
How you hate the villain.

1091
01:31:55.156 --> 01:31:58.455
If I were a young man,
I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous.


1092
01:31:59.828 --> 01:32:01.887
But you said you didn't even know him.

1093
01:32:01.996 --> 01:32:03.657
He was once my slave.

1094
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.400
Slave?

1095
01:32:07.836 --> 01:32:09.428
Did you know him well?

1096
01:32:10.171 --> 01:32:11.229
I did.

1097
01:32:12.974 --> 01:32:15.704
He's not such a
bad fellow for a pirate.

1098
01:32:16.978 --> 01:32:19.879
When he made his escape,
I was thrilled and happy.


1099
01:32:20.315 --> 01:32:23.148
That was before I knew how he would use
his freedom.


1100
01:32:23.251 --> 01:32:24.479
But aren't you forgetting...

1101
01:32:24.552 --> 01:32:27.715
that a man's bitter heart
may demand revenge?


1102
01:32:28.323 --> 01:32:30.052
That is the unforgivable thing:

1103
01:32:30.291 --> 01:32:32.486
to have put his revenge above
everything else...


1104
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.994
and to have destroyed himself.
That's what he's done.


1105
01:32:35.063 --> 01:32:37.327
I've seen pirates. 
I know their ways.

1106
01:32:37.465 --> 01:32:40.764
Cruel, evil, greedy,
plundering peaceful cities...


1107
01:32:40.835 --> 01:32:43.531
torturing their captives. Beasts.

1108
01:33:00.989 --> 01:33:03.321
Are you so much in love with him?

1109
01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:04.618
In love with him?

1110
01:33:04.826 --> 01:33:06.851
That you care so much what he does?

1111
01:33:06.928 --> 01:33:08.691
I don't care in
the least what he does.

1112
01:33:08.763 --> 01:33:11.493
Someone should,
in view of what he's doing now.


1113
01:33:11.966 --> 01:33:15.231
But your uncle's with the fleet
at Port Royal. That much is fortunate.


1114
01:33:15.303 --> 01:33:18.136
Why? What's this about my uncle
in Port Royal?


1115
01:33:18.206 --> 01:33:21.505
He amazes me, this fellow.
That's where he means to take us.


1116
01:33:21.576 --> 01:33:24.101
- No, he can't.
- They won't let me near him.


1117
01:33:24.179 --> 01:33:28.411
He's alone on his quarterdeck
in a fine Irish temper, I suspect.


1118
01:33:29.284 --> 01:33:32.845
- But I learned of it from one of the crew.
- Lord Willoughby, he mustn't.


1119
01:33:33.555 --> 01:33:35.352
My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.

1120
01:33:35.423 --> 01:33:38.984
He lives in the hope of one day
taking and hanging Capt. Blood.


1121
01:33:39.294 --> 01:33:41.626
Capt. Blood probably doesn't know that,
of course.


1122
01:33:41.696 --> 01:33:43.891
I doubt if it'd make any
difference if he did.


1123
01:33:43.965 --> 01:33:46.661
He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.

1124
01:33:47.302 --> 01:33:48.496
Chivalrous?

1125
01:33:49.404 --> 01:33:52.635
And yet he's been what he's been
these last three years...


1126
01:33:52.807 --> 01:33:54.832
and done what he's done.

1127
01:33:55.944 --> 01:33:57.878
Lord Willoughby, help me.

1128
01:33:58.713 --> 01:34:00.772
I see your point, my child...

1129
01:34:00.849 --> 01:34:03.682
but that's something
you must decide for yourself.


1130
01:34:04.352 --> 01:34:07.014
Life can be infernally complex.

1131
01:34:30.912 --> 01:34:33.039
It's hard to lay
tongue to the right words.

1132
01:34:33.114 --> 01:34:34.604
I'll lay tongue to them.

1133
01:34:34.682 --> 01:34:36.479
We won't sail to Jamaica.
Them's the words.


1134
01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:39.247
Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica.

1135
01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:42.184
When you risked your neck in a duel
over that petticoat...


1136
01:34:42.257 --> 01:34:43.690
that was your business.

1137
01:34:43.758 --> 01:34:46.989
But it's our necks you're risking now,
and I say no.


1138
01:34:47.061 --> 01:34:48.961
Not for her, nor a dozen like her.

1139
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:51.021
I got a great affection for my neck.

1140
01:34:51.099 --> 01:34:54.398
I have no wish to hear it cracked
by a hangman's knot.


1141
01:34:54.602 --> 01:34:58.129
This is what comes from sailing the seas
with a lovesick madman.


1142
01:35:00.875 --> 01:35:02.900
We've been with you since the first, Peter.

1143
01:35:02.977 --> 01:35:04.308
We have a right.

1144
01:35:08.016 --> 01:35:09.643
You, too, Jeremy?

1145
01:35:13.388 --> 01:35:14.753
All right, lads.

1146
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:16.985
What do you mean, Peter?

1147
01:35:17.592 --> 01:35:21.460
You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica.
There's nothing more to be said.


1148
01:35:21.996 --> 01:35:25.454
- Hurrah for our side!
- Quiet. You sound like a rooster.


1149
01:35:25.833 --> 01:35:27.232
Good night, lads.

1150
01:35:27.302 --> 01:35:30.533
Wait a minute, Peter.
Where are we sailing for?


1151
01:35:33.308 --> 01:35:34.900
That's for you to tell me...

1152
01:35:34.976 --> 01:35:36.705
since I'm no longer running this ship.

1153
01:35:36.778 --> 01:35:39.042
We didn't say that, Peter.

1154
01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.271
As Jeremy says, you've got the right.

1155
01:35:41.349 --> 01:35:44.807
You've been with me from the first,
and you've been loyal and true...


1156
01:35:44.919 --> 01:35:48.252
followed me into every tight corner
men could follow another.


1157
01:35:48.323 --> 01:35:51.622
- But you always got us out.
- And none the poorer for it.


1158
01:35:51.759 --> 01:35:54.387
Yes, but on this occasion,
there's no gold to be got.


1159
01:35:54.462 --> 01:35:57.022
Do you think it was
for gold we followed you?


1160
01:35:57.365 --> 01:36:00.926
No, but I can see now I've not got
the right to ask you to follow me.


1161
01:36:01.002 --> 01:36:03.266
The girl is my concern, not yours.

1162
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:07.832
Are we gonna stand by and see
this little snip laugh at our captain?


1163
01:36:07.942 --> 01:36:09.375
There's Bishop's fleet.

1164
01:36:09.444 --> 01:36:12.470
That might be paying a high price
to keep from being laughed at.


1165
01:36:12.547 --> 01:36:16.108
We're not yet such lily-livered scum
as to be afraid of Col. Bishop.


1166
01:36:16.417 --> 01:36:19.250
No. That is, not very afraid.

1167
01:36:20.788 --> 01:36:23.222
Fie on you deserting our captain
in this way...


1168
01:36:23.291 --> 01:36:27.057
you scurvy traitors, you Judas Iscariots,
you snakes in the grass...


1169
01:36:27.128 --> 01:36:29.028
you wolves in sheep's clothing!

1170
01:36:29.097 --> 01:36:31.292
I was only with
them to spy on them.

1171
01:36:33.768 --> 01:36:35.827
You'd better think carefully, lads.

1172
01:36:35.903 --> 01:36:38.701
Yonder lies Jamaica,
and straight we sail for it.


1173
01:36:38.873 --> 01:36:42.866
- Aye. And straight we sail for it.
- Aye!


1174
01:36:56.924 --> 01:37:00.291
- Ahoy, the deck!
- Ahoy!


1175
01:37:00.361 --> 01:37:02.659
I have sighted Port Royal!

1176
01:37:02.964 --> 01:37:05.432
Aye! Port Royal, you say?

1177
01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:06.933
Aye, sir!

1178
01:37:14.242 --> 01:37:16.107
There's something amiss!

1179
01:37:16.844 --> 01:37:21.076
I see flashes of gunfire
from ships in the harbor!


1180
01:37:21.349 --> 01:37:23.044
- Fetch the Captain.
- Aye, sir.


1181
01:37:23.117 --> 01:37:26.314
Bugler, all hands on deck!

1182
01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:58.584
It's terrible to wake up at dawn
dreaming of thunder.


1183
01:37:58.653 --> 01:38:00.814
That's gunfire if I ever heard any.

1184
01:38:02.223 --> 01:38:05.886
- There's a battle in Port Royal harbor.
- How many ships do you make out?


1185
01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.021
It's hard to see clearly in the early
morning light. I think there are two.


1186
01:38:10.331 --> 01:38:12.629
It's an attack on Port Royal, but who?

1187
01:38:13.734 --> 01:38:15.326
Pirate craft, perhaps.

1188
01:38:15.970 --> 01:38:18.097
Wish I could make out their flags.

1189
01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:22.771
- Perhaps I can supply you the answer.
- You can?


1190
01:38:22.844 --> 01:38:26.109
Yes, if I may speak to
so inaccessible a person.


1191
01:38:26.214 --> 01:38:29.377
If Port Royal is being attacked,
they are likely French ships.


1192
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:30.450
French?

1193
01:38:38.192 --> 01:38:40.626
You say Port Royal's attacked
by the French? Why?


1194
01:38:40.695 --> 01:38:43.186
When two countries are at war
and one is attacked...


1195
01:38:43.264 --> 01:38:45.129
who would it be but the enemy?

1196
01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:47.690
What's this? France and England at war?

1197
01:38:47.768 --> 01:38:51.067
You mean you don't know? Where have
you been the past few months?


1198
01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:52.970
At sea, out of touch with the world.

1199
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.168
The fire from the fortress is weakening!

1200
01:38:56.544 --> 01:38:59.980
One ship is already firing on the town!

1201
01:39:00.448 --> 01:39:01.540
That's strange.

1202
01:39:01.616 --> 01:39:04.585
Where is the English fleet
that's supposed to protect the town?


1203
01:39:04.652 --> 01:39:07.450
It's my turn to supply the answer.
It's out chasing pirates.


1204
01:39:07.522 --> 01:39:11.618
Bishop would never let his fleet leave its
post in time of war. He wouldn't dare.


1205
01:39:11.692 --> 01:39:15.355
Col. Bishop, if I may say,
is a very old and dear friend of mine.


1206
01:39:15.429 --> 01:39:18.330
- Lt's probably me he's after.
- That fool! Blunder!


1207
01:39:18.399 --> 01:39:20.299
And me in his own front yard.

1208
01:39:22.303 --> 01:39:24.828
Shorten sail there, Wolf.
Lend a hand forward, Andy.


1209
01:39:24.906 --> 01:39:28.171
Stand by helm and keep her headed
two points to larboard of the fort.


1210
01:39:28.242 --> 01:39:29.242
Aye, aye, sir.

1211
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:31.073
Get your men to their stations, Chester.

1212
01:39:31.145 --> 01:39:32.339
Port watch to stations!

1213
01:39:32.413 --> 01:39:33.903
Speed there, lads!

1214
01:39:34.482 --> 01:39:37.007
- Reef the fore topsail!
- Aye, aye, sir!


1215
01:39:37.084 --> 01:39:39.075
Take in the topgallant sail.

1216
01:39:40.555 --> 01:39:43.183
May I ask, Captain,
what are your intentions?


1217
01:39:43.257 --> 01:39:46.715
Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you
at Port Royal, but now....


1218
01:39:52.433 --> 01:39:54.799
Miss Bishop,
an unlooked-for circumstance...


1219
01:39:54.869 --> 01:39:57.167
prevents my landing you
on your own dock.


1220
01:39:57.238 --> 01:40:00.105
But I trust that if I put you ashore
on the beach nearby...


1221
01:40:00.174 --> 01:40:02.199
that would be equally satisfactory?

1222
01:40:02.276 --> 01:40:03.709
- L...
- Thank you.


1223
01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:08.778
Only please understand,
this is a bargain...


1224
01:40:08.849 --> 01:40:10.316
your freedom for my freedom.

1225
01:40:10.384 --> 01:40:13.217
From now on,
I no longer regard myself as a slave.


1226
01:40:14.355 --> 01:40:15.913
My life's my own...

1227
01:40:16.591 --> 01:40:19.151
even though I'm a thief and pirate.

1228
01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:24.698
Capt. Blood, are you,
an Englishman, thinking of leaving...


1229
01:40:24.765 --> 01:40:27.165
when yonder,
an English town is being taken?


1230
01:40:27.235 --> 01:40:29.669
Hagthorpe,
clear my deck and keep it cleared.


1231
01:40:29.737 --> 01:40:33.195
- Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him.
- Take your hands off!


1232
01:40:33.307 --> 01:40:36.435
- Wait, lads.
- Capt. Blood, I must talk to you.


1233
01:40:37.011 --> 01:40:38.774
Very well then, 
Lord Willoughby.

1234
01:40:38.846 --> 01:40:42.009
Myself, I've the honor to be Irish,
but part of my crew's English.


1235
01:40:42.083 --> 01:40:44.278
I was myself once, too, in loyalty.

1236
01:40:44.452 --> 01:40:45.680
Of what should we be thinking?

1237
01:40:45.753 --> 01:40:48.017
Of the chance to fight for your king.

1238
01:40:48.089 --> 01:40:49.613
To fight for my king?

1239
01:40:50.057 --> 01:40:53.117
Yes. He was loyal enough
to send me to seek you out...


1240
01:40:53.227 --> 01:40:55.752
to offer you pardon for your past crimes...

1241
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:58.196
freedom from your slavery
and more than that...


1242
01:40:58.266 --> 01:41:01.292
a commission in his own navy
for you and your men.


1243
01:41:01.702 --> 01:41:05.263
You hear that, Chester?
The King wants us to join his navy!


1244
01:41:08.743 --> 01:41:10.506
Read it for yourself.

1245
01:41:10.578 --> 01:41:12.773
Lord Willoughby,
you're a guest aboard my ship...


1246
01:41:12.847 --> 01:41:16.283
and I've still some notion left me
from better days of decent behavior...


1247
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:18.841
so I'll not be telling you
what I think of this offer.


1248
01:41:18.919 --> 01:41:21.786
All I'll say is,
I wouldn't soil my hands with it...


1249
01:41:21.856 --> 01:41:24.723
even though they're the hands
of a thief and a pirate.


1250
01:41:25.092 --> 01:41:27.617
But this concerns you, too, my lads.

1251
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:30.163
What do you say to serving the King?

1252
01:41:30.231 --> 01:41:31.493
No!

1253
01:41:35.469 --> 01:41:37.960
I'd like to serve
him with a rope necktie.

1254
01:41:38.839 --> 01:41:40.830
I'd rot before I'd serve him.

1255
01:41:41.742 --> 01:41:44.870
I'd sink this ship with all hands
before I'd serve him.


1256
01:41:44.945 --> 01:41:48.039
It would appear then
that my crew is still a little dubious...


1257
01:41:48.115 --> 01:41:50.515
as to the merits of His Majesty's offer.

1258
01:41:50.718 --> 01:41:53.812
However you hate the King,
England is still England.


1259
01:41:53.954 --> 01:41:57.185
And a bad king is bad king,
and worse one if he's James.


1260
01:41:57.458 --> 01:42:00.621
James?
This commission is sent by King William.


1261
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:05.121
King William? Who may King William be
and what's he king of?


1262
01:42:05.199 --> 01:42:08.464
I'm alluding to His Majesty,
King William III, William of Orange...


1263
01:42:08.536 --> 01:42:11.334
who, with Queen Mary,
has come over from the Netherlands...


1264
01:42:11.405 --> 01:42:14.636
and has been ruling England
the past two months or more.


1265
01:42:17.078 --> 01:42:20.343
They've roused themselves at home
and kicked out that pimple James?


1266
01:42:20.414 --> 01:42:23.144
Yes, and he's fled to France
and he's in hiding there...


1267
01:42:23.217 --> 01:42:25.276
and England and France are at war.

1268
01:42:25.386 --> 01:42:28.287
The English people will go so far,
Capt. Blood...


1269
01:42:28.356 --> 01:42:31.291
and then they get up
on their stubborn hind legs.


1270
01:42:31.359 --> 01:42:33.657
- And William sent us this commission?
- Yes.


1271
01:42:34.195 --> 01:42:38.097
He knows you're good men,
wrongfully sold into slavery.


1272
01:42:38.165 --> 01:42:41.464
He can use good men in his navy.

1273
01:42:41.535 --> 01:42:43.628
It's the long-winded fellow you are.

1274
01:42:43.704 --> 01:42:46.400
Why didn't you tell us this
in the first place?


1275
01:42:47.808 --> 01:42:50.368
Bugler, summon the men amidships!

1276
01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:03.317
Men!
I've just heard a startling piece of news.


1277
01:43:03.457 --> 01:43:07.689
King James is kicked out of England
and good King William reigns in his stead.


1278
01:43:11.632 --> 01:43:14.931
For me,
this changes the shape of the world.


1279
01:43:15.236 --> 01:43:17.329
For you who were slaves with me...

1280
01:43:17.405 --> 01:43:19.669
it means that we're no longer slaves.

1281
01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:22.766
That we once more have
a home and a country.


1282
01:43:23.110 --> 01:43:24.668
For you who are English...

1283
01:43:24.745 --> 01:43:27.578
it means a chance to fight
for your native land...


1284
01:43:27.648 --> 01:43:31.243
for I now propose to sail into Port Royal
and take it from the French!


1285
01:43:31.318 --> 01:43:33.309
Those of you who are not English...

1286
01:43:33.521 --> 01:43:36.490
will have to be content
with fighting for Capt. Blood...


1287
01:43:38.459 --> 01:43:41.394
and the loot you'll find
on the French ships.


1288
01:43:42.763 --> 01:43:45.789
- Are you willing to fight, men?
- Aye!


1289
01:43:46.801 --> 01:43:49.133
Have we an English battle flag on board,
Hagthorpe?


1290
01:43:49.203 --> 01:43:53.162
We have every manner of battle flag,
including a lady's purple petticoat.


1291
01:43:53.474 --> 01:43:55.237
Wait, I've a better idea.

1292
01:43:55.309 --> 01:43:58.142
When an English lion creeps up
on a nest of French foxes...


1293
01:43:58.212 --> 01:43:59.474
he wears a bushy tail.

1294
01:43:59.547 --> 01:44:02.880
Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.
Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf.


1295
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:04.144
Stand by the helm, Jeremy.

1296
01:44:04.218 --> 01:44:06.209
Forward, men, to your stations.

1297
01:44:07.188 --> 01:44:09.679
- Ls that satisfactory to you?
- Perfectly.


1298
01:44:19.767 --> 01:44:21.462
Clear decks for action!

1299
01:44:26.307 --> 01:44:29.470
Capt. Blood's orders.
You'll be put ashore with these men.


1300
01:44:29.543 --> 01:44:31.807
A ship is no place for a woman
in time of battle.


1301
01:44:31.879 --> 01:44:34.347
- I want to talk to him.
- I'm sorry. The Captain's busy.


1302
01:44:34.415 --> 01:44:35.814
- Lnto the boat.
- Aye, sir.


1303
01:44:35.883 --> 01:44:37.510
Follow me, Miss Bishop.

1304
01:45:24.899 --> 01:45:27.197
Musketeers, to your stations!

1305
01:45:49.890 --> 01:45:51.118
A French ship.

1306
01:45:54.428 --> 01:45:57.295
Hope we get on them
before they discover the trick.


1307
01:46:10.811 --> 01:46:11.937
- Andy.
- Aye, Peter.


1308
01:46:12.012 --> 01:46:15.004
Run to Hagthorpe.
Tell him to fetch all the hot coals.


1309
01:46:15.082 --> 01:46:17.050
- Put them by the guns.
- Hot coals, sir?


1310
01:46:17.117 --> 01:46:19.915
- No questions. Run.
- Aye, aye, sir!


1311
01:46:27.861 --> 01:46:30.762
Stand by ready to fire as soon as
we come amidships.


1312
01:46:30.998 --> 01:46:34.525
Stand ready to fire
as soon as we've come amidships!


1313
01:46:35.002 --> 01:46:36.663
Open your ports!

1314
01:47:10.871 --> 01:47:13.669
Strike that French flag
and hoist our own colors.


1315
01:47:17.311 --> 01:47:18.938
Man your port guns!

1316
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:25.077
Ready, Hagthorpe?

1317
01:47:27.454 --> 01:47:28.785
Fire!

1318
01:47:42.536 --> 01:47:45.505
Hagthorpe,
give them the hot galley broadside!


1319
01:47:45.572 --> 01:47:48.132
Aye, Peter! Load them, lads!

1320
01:48:33.087 --> 01:48:35.988
Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line!

1321
01:48:45.632 --> 01:48:47.600
We never miss.

1322
01:49:04.218 --> 01:49:07.585
- That's one ship neatly disposed off.
- Now for the other one.


1323
01:49:08.055 --> 01:49:10.888
- Jeremy, helm quarter to port.
- Aye, aye, Peter.


1324
01:49:10.958 --> 01:49:12.585
Clear away that burning wreckage!

1325
01:49:15.796 --> 01:49:18.697
- Port guns, Wolf. Hurry.
- Aye, Peter.


1326
01:49:18.999 --> 01:49:21.229
Man your port guns!

1327
01:49:46.059 --> 01:49:48.823
Those French gunners
must've learnt their trade in England.


1328
01:49:48.896 --> 01:49:50.830
That's their third direct hit.

1329
01:50:00.707 --> 01:50:02.971
Two guns out of order.
Ship's taking water below.


1330
01:50:03.043 --> 01:50:05.068
Replace them with two
from the starboard side.


1331
01:50:05.145 --> 01:50:07.841
- Keep hammering that waterline.
- Aye, aye, sir.


1332
01:50:20.761 --> 01:50:23.025
Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking.
What should we do?


1333
01:50:23.096 --> 01:50:26.361
Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking.
Get your men forward.


1334
01:50:26.433 --> 01:50:27.433
Aye, aye, sir.

1335
01:50:30.003 --> 01:50:32.335
- What now, Peter?
- Take the helm yourself, lad.


1336
01:50:32.406 --> 01:50:33.873
Straight into them!

1337
01:50:36.743 --> 01:50:39.803
- We'll never do it, Peter!
- Musketeers to the prow!


1338
01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.816
Grappling hooks to larboard. Forward
gunners, fire as hard as they can load!


1339
01:50:47.754 --> 01:50:49.449
Rapid fire, men!

1340
01:50:49.523 --> 01:50:51.616
Hagthorpe, double them up!

1341
01:50:51.959 --> 01:50:54.826
They won't take it, Peter!
They're blazing hot!


1342
01:51:03.871 --> 01:51:06.101
Up into the shrouds, men!

1343
01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:15.611
We're going to swing across on ropes.

1344
01:51:15.682 --> 01:51:17.582
When we clear the rail,
come over the side!


1345
01:51:17.651 --> 01:51:18.743
Aye, aye, Peter!

1346
01:51:23.624 --> 01:51:25.888
You and your men swing across
into their rigging.


1347
01:51:25.959 --> 01:51:28.928
When you see me cut down
that French flag, drop down.


1348
01:51:31.965 --> 01:51:34.024
Up, men, into the shrouds!

1349
01:51:36.837 --> 01:51:39.397
Strong and sure! 
Grapnels over!

1350
01:52:19.179 --> 01:52:21.704
All right, my hearties, follow me!

1351
01:52:45.138 --> 01:52:46.366
Follow on, men!

1352
01:53:06.159 --> 01:53:08.992
"Dust thou art,
and unto dust thou shalt return."


1353
01:53:37.491 --> 01:53:39.186
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."

1354
01:53:39.259 --> 01:53:41.352
Leviticus 19:18.

1355
01:55:22.762 --> 01:55:26.323
- Hurry, Cato. We'll be late.
- Yes. The fleet's in already.


1356
01:55:35.041 --> 01:55:37.100
- Stop!
- Yes.


1357
01:55:41.281 --> 01:55:42.908
Capt. Blood!

1358
01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:48.180
Miss Bishop.

1359
01:55:49.789 --> 01:55:51.757
I'll be on the veranda.

1360
01:55:54.528 --> 01:55:55.927
I thought you'd gone.

1361
01:55:55.996 --> 01:55:57.987
You can't be here.
My uncle's just returned.


1362
01:55:58.064 --> 01:55:59.759
- Yes, I know.
- You know?


1363
01:55:59.833 --> 01:56:01.698
- What are you going to do?
- Just stay here.


1364
01:56:01.768 --> 01:56:03.929
No, it's impossible. 
You mustn't stay here.

1365
01:56:04.004 --> 01:56:06.131
- He's sworn he'll hang you.
- I doubt he will.


1366
01:56:06.206 --> 01:56:08.003
I've always been bad luck for your uncle.

1367
01:56:08.074 --> 01:56:11.305
You can't know the threats he's made.
The dreadful threats he's made.


1368
01:56:11.378 --> 01:56:13.369
His whole life is spent
in searching for you.


1369
01:56:13.446 --> 01:56:16.279
- Now he's found me.
- But you can still save yourself.


1370
01:56:16.349 --> 01:56:18.249
Please, for my sake.

1371
01:56:18.318 --> 01:56:22.084
For your sake? What do you mean for your
sake? Isn't it true that you hate me?


1372
01:56:23.156 --> 01:56:25.420
- Hate you?
- Or is it that you love me?


1373
01:56:25.992 --> 01:56:28.893
I'll hide you. And tonight after
dark, I'll find some way...


1374
01:56:28.962 --> 01:56:30.862
You love me, don't you?

1375
01:56:32.032 --> 01:56:35.092
Whom else would I love? Now will you?

1376
01:56:35.168 --> 01:56:36.760
You love me!

1377
01:56:36.836 --> 01:56:39.304
Lord Willoughby, she loves me!

1378
01:56:41.141 --> 01:56:43.541
He'll be here any minute.
I'll hide you somewhere.


1379
01:56:43.610 --> 01:56:46.135
We'll hide together. 
I know just the place.

1380
01:56:58.291 --> 01:56:59.519
How's this?

1381
01:56:59.593 --> 01:57:01.754
You must be mad. 
He'll come here first.

1382
01:57:01.828 --> 01:57:03.625
Good. I forgot to tell you.

1383
01:57:03.797 --> 01:57:05.788
The Governor and I are
on the best of terms.


1384
01:57:05.865 --> 01:57:08.356
He lets me come and go here
as I please. Look.


1385
01:57:14.074 --> 01:57:17.271
- You can't arrest me!
- I have, by order of the Governor.


1386
01:57:17.344 --> 01:57:19.904
The Governor? You are mad.
I am the governor.


1387
01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:22.107
You mean, you were the governor.

1388
01:57:22.382 --> 01:57:25.078
But we've changed that in your absence.

1389
01:57:25.185 --> 01:57:26.379
What?

1390
01:57:26.453 --> 01:57:29.980
You're broken for abandoning your post
in time of war.


1391
01:57:30.257 --> 01:57:31.257
Who are you?

1392
01:57:31.324 --> 01:57:34.657
My name is Willoughby. I'm a special
emissary of His Majesty the King.


1393
01:57:34.761 --> 01:57:35.921
Lord Willoughby?

1394
01:57:35.996 --> 01:57:38.430
- You were informed, I think, of my coming.
- Yes.


1395
01:57:38.498 --> 01:57:41.661
Yet you went off
on some wild goose chase after a pirate...


1396
01:57:41.735 --> 01:57:44.203
leaving your capital at the mercy
of the enemy.


1397
01:57:44.271 --> 01:57:47.434
Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter,
as you may well find.


1398
01:57:47.507 --> 01:57:49.600
Seeing that you hold your office
from James...


1399
01:57:49.776 --> 01:57:52.802
it's even possible the charge of treason
lies against you.


1400
01:57:52.879 --> 01:57:53.879
But, my lord...

1401
01:57:53.947 --> 01:57:56.814
I'm not concerned to hear
your reasons, man.


1402
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:59.544
- His Excellency the Governor will.
- The Governor?


1403
01:57:59.619 --> 01:58:01.246
You'll find him inside.

1404
01:58:01.388 --> 01:58:04.289
It rests entirely with him
whether you're hanged or not.


1405
01:58:06.359 --> 01:58:08.520
This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood.

1406
01:58:08.595 --> 01:58:11.063
What a reckoning
there'll be when we meet.


1407
01:58:12.799 --> 01:58:16.565
Have mercy, Your Excellency!

1408
01:58:16.770 --> 01:58:19.238
- Arabella, why are you here?
- Uncle!


1409
01:58:20.807 --> 01:58:23.401
I have been pleading
with the Governor on your behalf...


1410
01:58:23.476 --> 01:58:26.877
asking him to be as merciful
as you would be cruel.


1411
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:32.346
Uncle, this is the Governor.

1412
01:58:38.825 --> 01:58:40.952
Good morning, Uncle.
